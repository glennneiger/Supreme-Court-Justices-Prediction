mr.
charles
r.
hembree
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
should
like
to
use
my
time
this
morning
to
concentrate
on
four
areas.
that
is,
the
attempt
to
clarify
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case,
to
focus
on
some
of
the
undisputable
facts
in
the
case,
comment
on
the
sixth
circuit's
holding
in
the
case
which
held
for
the
taxpayers
in
holding
that
they
were
the
taxpayers
and
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
deductions
claim,
and
point
out
some
of
the
numerous
fallacies
that
are
contained
in
the
petitioner's
brief
and
in
petitioner's
argument
here
this
morning.
first,
i
think
it's
very
important
in
this
case
to
understand
that
the
underlying
issue
is
an
issue
of
who
is
the
taxpayer.
this
i
think
is
a
much
more
ingrained
principle
in
this
case
than
the
two-tier
tax
system.
and
once
you
get
to
the
point
of
looking
to
who
is
the
taxpayer
in
the
case,
and
then
look
at
the
facts
as
found
by
the
tax
court
and
accepted
by
the
sixth
circuit,
there
is
no
question
but
what
the
income
was
earned
and
the
expenses
were
incurred
by
the
partnerships
and
the
proprietorships,
and
not
by
the
corporation
which
had
a
very
very
minor
part
in
this
whole
picture
insofar
as
its
activities.
it
held
nominal
legal
title
and
put
a
mortgage
on
the
property
to
secure
a
loan
in
each
instance
to
secure
a
loan
that
was
taken
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
partnership
or
the
proprietorship.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
yes,
justice
white,
i
believe
that
we
would
be
in
terrible
trouble
because
in
five
of
the
six
projects,
the
owners
of
the
partnership
were
two
or
three
individuals
only
one
of
whom
was
mr.
bollinger
who
was
the
sole
shareholder
in
the
corporation
and
there
was
a
nominee
in--
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
there
has
not
been
a
case
insofar
as
i
know
that--
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
--the
method
used
here
to
comply
with
the
usury
statute,
and
i
think
it
was
a
compliance,
we
complied
with
it
by
having
the
loan
made
in
the
name
of
a
corporation.
now,
there
was
a
nominee
agreement
in
each
of
the
eight
projects,
and
the
nominee
agreement
specifically
provided
that
the
corporation
was
to
act
as
the
nominee
and
agent
in
holding
bare
legal
title
and
in
placing
the
mortgage
on
the
property
for
the
benefit
of
the
partnerships.
the
one
thing
that
gets
lost
in
the
argument
i
have
to
say
the
catacombs
of
the
petitioner's
argument
because
of
the
areas
that
are
so
unknown
is
that
this
principle
of
the
one
who
earns
the
income
is
the
proper
taxpayer
gets
completely
lost.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
in
that
situation,
judge
scalia,
you
have
moline
properties
because
there
you
are
doing
business
as
a
corporation.
the
corporation
is
the
one
which
earns
the
income
even
though
the
individual
maybe
is
in
the
picture.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
i
think
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
a
corporation
itself
is
a
fiction,
it
is
a
recognized
fiction
which
has
separate
entity
classification
for
tax
purposes,
and
we
recognize
that.
we
never
have
questioned
that.
but
the
question
comes
back
when
the
corporation
is
formed,
what
does
that
corporation
do
and
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
a
corporation
there
does
not
change
the
fact
that
an
individual
who
is
the
sole
shareholder
can
do
things
on
his
own,
can
own
property
without
it
being
in
the
corporation,
and
can
transact
a
completely
separate
proprietorship
operation,
or
be
in,
as
in
this
case,
a
partner
in
other
types
of
businesses
that
the
corporation
is
not
in.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
yes,
justice
blackmun.
the
kentucky
usury
law
was
changed
in
1972
which
was
right
in
the
middle
of
this
period,
and
i
think
that
indicated
that
the
kentucky
law,
as
most
of
the
laws
in
various
states
involving
usury
became
antiquated
because
of
the
high
rate
of
increase
in
the
interest
rates,
and
as
soon
as
the
legislature
could
get
around
to
it,
it
did
correct
the
problem
that
existed
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
now,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
nominee
corporations
can
be
disregarded
as
separate
entities.
we
have
made
it
clear
throughout
our
brief
that
they
are
recognized
as
separate
entities.
it's
only
a
question
once
they
are
recognized,
you
do
not
actually
have
to
attribute
to
them,
income
that
they
did
not
earn.
and
this
is
the
principal
emphasis
that
i
want
to
make
on
that
point.
the
real
issue,
the
one
that
was
tried
in
the
tax
court,
and
the
one
that
was
considered
in
the
circuit
court,
is
whether
the
proprietorships
and
the
partnerships
which
generated
the
income
and
expenses
may
have
the
deductions
for
the
net
losses
that
were
generated
in
the
earlier
years
of
construction
and
operations
of
the
apartment
complexes.
now,
it's
important
to
understand
that
there
were
eight
apartment
complexes
and
each
of
them
was
owned
by
separate
entities
in
the
terms
that
two
of
the
projects
were
owned
and
operated
by
mr.
bollinger,
as
separate
proprietorships.
six
of
them
were
owned
by
the
partnerships
in
which
mr.
bollinger
was
only
one
of
the
partners.
as
far
as
the
operation
of
the
five
partnerships
which
were
using
creekside,
inc.
as
the
corporate
nominee,
mr.
bollinger
did
not
have
control
of
four
of
those
in
the
sense
of
ownership.
he
didn't
have
control
of
any
of
them
in
the
sense
of
voting
power,
because
in
the
most
he
had
in
the
five
partnerships,
the
most
he
had
in
four
of
the
partnerships
was
a
fifty
percent
ownership
interest,
and
he
had
a
sixty-six
and
two-thirds
interest
in
one
of
the
partnerships.
but
in
that
one,
under
kentucky
law
in
the
absence
of
specifying
otherwise,
each
partner,
irrespective
of
the
percentage
interest,
had
equal
vote.
so
we
feel
that
in
those
five
cases
or
five
situations,
there
was
a
lack
of
control
of
the
partnerships
by
mr.
bollinger.
now,
the
government
makes
a
comported
argument
that
there
should
be
some
kind
of
a
constructive
ownership
implied
which
we
think
is
completely
without
merit.
now,
i'd
like
to
just
mention
briefly
some
of
the
very
what
i
consider
to
be
crucial
facts
that
were
found
by
the
tax
court
and
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
and
they
are
that
the
proprietorships
and
the
partnerships
were
the
owners
of
the
apartment
complexes,
and
they
remained
the
real
and
true
direct
owners
upon
the
transfer
of
the
bare
legal
title
to
the
nominee
corporations.
and
the
transfers
to
the
nominee
corporations
were
for
the
limited
purposes
of
holding
title
and
placing
mortgages
on
the
properties
to
secure
the
loans
taken
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
partnerships
or
the
proprietorships.
the
proprietorships
and
the
partnerships
constructed
the
businesses
of
constructing
and
operating
the
apartment
complexes
in
proprietorship
form
or
partnership
form
and
not
in
corporate
form.
this
is
a
specific
finding
that
was
made
by
the
court.
all
of
these
are.
the
proprietorships
and
the
partnerships
constructed
the
apartment
buildings,
they
operated
and
managed
the
apartment
buildings,
they
generated
the
income
and
the
expenses
from
the
operations
of
the
apartment
buildings.
they
received
the
income
and
they
paid
the
expenses
in
connection
with
the
construction,
the
development
and
operation
of
the
projects.
they
made
all
the
interest
and
principal
payments
on
the
loans.
they
paid
all
expenses
otherwise
for
the
projects.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
on
that
point,
justice
stevens,
the
only
way
that
they
could
be
agents
of
the
corporation
would
be
if
the
corporation
were
the
owner
of
the
property
and
they
were
operating
under
that
type
of
an
arrangement.
here
they
were
not
because
under
the
nominee
agreement
that
was
present
in
each
one
of
these
projects,
the
only
owner
of
the
project
was
the
partnership
or
the
proprietorship.
the
only
ownership
that
the
corporation
had
was
bare
record
title,
nothing
more.
by
the
same
token,
none
of
the
operations
were
made
in
the
name
of
the
corporation,
and
everyone
who
dealt
with
the
partnership
or
the
proprietorship
was
dealing
with
them
as
such.
the
corporation
was
not
involved
and
did
not
become
liable
for
what
the
partners
were
doing.
so
for
that
reason,
i
think
just
the
opposite
is
true.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
i
believe
they
might
be
able
to
recover,
but
they
would
be
able
to
recover
in
the
final
effect
only
from
the
partnership
or
the
proprietorship
because--
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
--any
liability
that
the
corporation
became
liable
for,
they
were
indemnified
under--
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
--i
believe
that
would
be
the
correct
result,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
no,
we
don't
attempt
to
ignore
the
corporation.
we
accept
the
corporation
for
what
it
was,
and
for
what
it
did.
the
thing
about
it
is,
it
did
so
little.
it
held
bare
legal
title,
operated
to
get
the
loans
on
the
books,
and
that
was
it.
and
for
that
limited
purpose,
the
petitioner
is
contending
that
all
of
the
income
generated
from
the
operations
of
the
entire
apartment
complex
should
be
then
treated
as
if
it
had
been
earned
by
the
corporation,
the
nominee
corporation.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
i
don't
distinguish
moline,
your
honor.
i
say
that
moline
supports
us
because
moline
properties
is
a
case
which
the
issue
to
start
with
in
that
case
was,
who
is
the
taxpayer,
and
the
board
of
tax
appeals
held
that
the
taxpayer
was
the
sole
shareholder
and
the
basis
for
that
holding
was
that
you
ignored
the
separate
entity.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
and
a
very
important
aspect
of
that
and
this
gets
over
to
a
point
that
was
brought
up
by
mr.
horowitz.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
i
didn't--
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
--it
did
before
this
court
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
well,
i
think
the
thing
that
we're
interested
in
here
is
what
this
court
held
in
moline
properties,
and
in
that
case,--
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
--this
court,
in
reversing,
or
in
affirming
the
circuit's
reversal
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
held
that
the
separate
entity
must
be
recognized
and
that
the
income
of
that
separate
entity
must
be
reported
by
it.
and
the
big
distinction
between
that
case
and
our
case
is
that
there,
the
income
was
the
income
of
moline
properties,
the
corporation.
here,
the
income
that
is
sought
to
be
shifted
from,
or
the
losses
attempted
to
be
shifted
from
these
partnerships.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
that's
where
that
assertion
is
completely
and
diametrically
opposed
to
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
court
which
were
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
there's
no
basis
being
pointed
out
for
contesting
those
facts.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
no,
your
honor.
because
the
only
rights
the
corporation
had
was
what
rights
it
got
under
the
nominee
agreement
and
the
nominee
agreement
limited
completely
everything
the
corporation
was
insofar
as
the
property
to
holding
bare
record
title
and
establishing
the
loans,
the
mortgage
on
the
loans.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
well,
i
think
that's
a
part
of
it,
your
honor.
i
think
we're
dealing
really
with
different--
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
believe
there
are
two
aspects
over
the
moline
properties
case,
number
one
and
the
principal
part
of
it
was
that
the
sole
shareholder
was
attempting
to
say
i
am
the
sole
shareholder
and
i
have
the
complete
beneficial
interest
of
everything
the
corporation
has.
therefore,
we
should
be
treated
as
one,
and
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
sale
of
property
by
the
corporation
on
which
there
was
a
gain,
there
shouldn't
be
a
separate
tax,
it
should
be
taxed
to
me
directly.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
that's
true.
and
the
argument
was
made
as
an
alternative
that
there
was
an
agency
relationship
that
would
bring
the
money
back
and
the
corporation
was
merely
acting
as
agent,
but
there
was
no
agreement.
and
this
court
in
affirming
the
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
that
out,
that
there
was
no
agency
agreement
or
any
other
restriction
on
the
title
and
ownership
that
the
corporation
had.
so
there
is
i
think
why
the
moline
property
case
is
not
from
the
factual
standpoint
of
any
bearing
in
this
case,
but
the
principle
that
was
established
there,
i
think,
was
an
affirmance
of
the
basic
principle
that
whoever
earns
the
income
is
the
one
who
must
report
it.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
no,
your
honor,
not
in
terms
of
shifting
the
income
of
the
type
that
we're
talking
about
here.
because
if
you
can
each
year
surely
you
could
as
a
sole
shareholder,
enter
into
a
new
agreement
with
the
cooperation
and
once
you
enter
into
that
agreement,
then
it
depends
on
what
the
relationship
is
that's
created
by
that
agreement.
if
you--
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
--if
that's
the
agreement,
then,
it
does
not
stand
up
because
in
that
instance
because
it's
nothing
more
than
an
anticipatory
assignment
of
income,
and
that
is
not
a
proper
relationship
under
the
national
carbide
case.
the
national
carbide
case,
that
would
make
it
really
fall
right
into
the
category
of
being
solely
dependent
this
relationship
under
that
kind
of
an
agreement
would
be
solely
dependent
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
the
ownership.
mr.
charles
r.
hembree
well,
i
think
the
big
distinction,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
income
was
not
anything
that
the
corporation
had
any
right
to
under
the
agreement
that
is
involved.
now,
i
know
this
doesn't
fully
answer
your
question,
but
the
reason
that
it
doesn't
go
to
the
corporation
and
can't
go
to
the
corporation
in
this
instance
is
because
the
corporation
had
no
right
to
it.
now,
if
there
is
an
agreement
that
gives
the
corporation
the
right
to
it,
and
the
corporation
earns
it,
now,
the
agreement
has
to
be
one
that
reflects
a
relationship
and
this
is
what
national
carbide
is
all
about
is
the
relationship
that
is
created
by
the
agency
agreement
must
be
one
that
is
reflecting
the
activities
that
are
involved.
and
i
think
in
this
instance,
the
sixth
circuit
came
up
with
the
right
results
and
that
is
that
you
look
to
the
overall
situations
to
see
if
the
normal
indices
of
agency
have
been
satisfied.
and
if
they
have
been
satisfied,
then
the
agency
is
going
to
be
recognized.
the
way
you
determine
that
is
comparing
that
with
whether
or
not
an
unrelated
entity
would
be
willing
to
do
the
same
thing
that
the
related
entity
has
done.
and
you
do
not
get
into
the
consideration,
and
incidentally,
this
is
the
only
real
basis
that
the
petitioner
has
pointed
out
for
this
failure
of
the
so-called
fifth
circuit
on
the
relationship
aspect
is
that
there
was
no
consideration
paid.
the
consideration,
as
you,
justice
scalia,
have
pointed
out
is
not
necessary
insofar
as
establishing
a
valid
agency
relationship
consideration
is
pure
black
letter
restatement
agency
law.
that
you
don't
need
the
consideration.
so
that
being
the
only
thing
that
the
petitioner
is
relying
on,
we
get
back
into
an
area
where
we
get
lost
on
trying
to
use
a
principal
that
is
set
up
in
moline
properties,
and
then
another
principle
that
is
set
up
in
national
carbide
they
tried
to
pull
together
but
they
don't
mesh
because
of
the
different
situations
that
were
involved,
and
because
of
the
different
principles.
on
the
one
hand,
you're
talking
about
a
separate
entity,
and
on
the
other
hand,
you're
talking
about
the
basically
an
anticipatory
assignment
of
income
in
national
carbide.
i
should
like
to...
i
don't
like
to
spend
much
of
my
time
pointing
out
errors
that
have
been
made
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner...
but
i
do
feel
that
it
is
very
important
to
point
out
certain
misstatements
arid
distortions
that
are
contained
in
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner.
petitioner
states
on
page
18
as
a
fact
that
the
corporation's
incurred
interest
expense
on
loans.
however,
the
tax
court
specifically
found
that
the
partnership
made
all
interest
payments
and
is
contrary
to
the
statement
by
petitioner
in
the
brief.
petitioner
also
states
that
the
corporation
owned
the
properties.
however,
the
tax
court
specifically
found
that
the
corporation
owned
no
assets
and
also
found
that
the
partnership,
and
not
the
corporations
were
the
owners
of
the
apartment
complexes.
now,
those
just
don't
square
when
you
talk
about
the
statement
is
made
in
the
brief
and
what
the
actual
facts
are
as
found
by
the
court.
also,
at
page
18
of
the
brief,
petitioner
states
that
the
court
of
appeals
stated,
"that
this
supposed
principal
agent
relationship
superceded
moline
property
special
entity
rule.
"
there
is
no
such
statement
made
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
know
how
to
deal
with
statements
that
are
made
in
the
brief,
how
to
respond
to
them,
when
they
refer
to
matters
in
the
lower
court's
opinion
which
just
do
not
exist.
petitioner
also
states
that
the
sixth
circuit
concluded
that
even
if
the
corporations
were
viable
separate
entities,
their
income
and
expenses
could
be
attributed
directly
to
bollinger
and
his
partners
under
the
agency
theory.
that
was
not
the
holding
of
the
sixth
circuit
at
all.
the
holding
of
the
sixth
circuit
was
that
the
proprietorships
and
the
partnerships
conducted
the
business
of
constructing
and
operating
the
apartments
in
the
partnership
and
proprietorship
forms,
and
not
in
the
corporate
form,
and
that
the
income
realized
was
attributable
to
the
efforts
and
assets
of
the
proprietorships
and
the
partnership.
thus,
i
think
it
is
completely
erroneous
and
misleading
for
the
petitioner
to
say
in
his
brief
that
the
income
and
expenses
were
considered
by
the
sixth
circuit
to
be
those
of
the
corporation
and
that
it
attributed
the
corporation's
earnings
to
the
partnerships
and
proprietorships.
one
other
thing
which
i
briefly
mentioned
before,
but
this
gets
to
the
very
heart
of
it,
at
page
2
of
his
reply
brief,
the
petitioner
states
that
respondents
note,
at
page
of
the
brief,
that
"corporate
ownership
of
properties
was
specified
by
the
lenders
as
a
prerequisite
of
making
the
loans.
"
this
is
a
complete
misstatement
of
what
was
said
in
respondents'
brief.
the
statement
in
the
respondent's
brief
referred
only
to
nominal
debtor
and
that
the
nominal
debtor
be
a
corporate
nominee
of
the
partnerships
and
that
record
title
to
the
property
be
held
by
the
corporate
nominee.
now,
nominal
debtor
and
corporate
nominee
do
not
add
up
to
ownership,
and
that
i
think
also
is
a
very
misleading
statement.
recognizing
that
the
time
is
just
about
gone,
i
want
to
make
one
statement
that
clears
this
whole
brings
the
whole
case
i
think
into
perspective
in
terms
of
what
we're
dealing
with
and
the
interpretation
of
the
national
carbide
case.
there
this
court
was
attempting
to
set
up
certain
rules
that
would
be
useful
in
determining
whether
a
valid
agency
arrangement
existed.
the
reason
they
were
doing
it
was
to
try
to
determine
who
was
the
taxpayer
with
regard
to
the
income
that
was
involved
in
that
case,
and
the
income
in
that
case
had
been
earned
by
the
agents.
and
because
it
had
been
earned
by
the
agent
and
the
agency
agreement
did
nothing
more
than
make
an
anticipatory
assignment
of
it,
the
court
held
that
the
agency
agreement
would
not
be
recognized,
because
certainly
the
assignment
was
based
on
joint
ownership
of
the
two
entities
and
nothing
more.
what
the
petitioner
is
attempting
to
do
in
this
case,
in
using
the
so-called
fifth
factor
and
the
so-called
sixth
factors
in
national
carbide
to
support--
