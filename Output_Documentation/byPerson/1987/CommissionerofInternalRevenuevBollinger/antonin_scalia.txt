justice
scalia
what
would
be
needed
here
in
order
to
make
it
separately
taxable,
or
reportable
on
the
individuals'
returns?
justice
scalia
you
know,
not
ten
things.
what's
the
minimum
they
could
have
done
that
would
have
made
you
happy?
justice
scalia
cases
where
it's
a
clear
agent,
i
mean,
but
what
facts
in
this
particular
case
would
be--
justice
scalia
--if
you
just
had
to
change
a
couple
of
facts,
what
would
do
the
trick?
justice
scalia
but
it
has
to
be
a
compensated
agency.
i
mean,
you
can
be
an
agent
without
getting
compensated
for
it.
justice
scalia
you're
asking
for
some
special
rule.
you're
saying
that
what
might
be
enough
to
establish
agency
in
the
ordinary
situation
where
there's
not
a
corporate
control
relationship
isn't
enough
in
the
corporate
control
relationship.
that
because
of
the
difficulty
deciding
how
much
of
the
control
comes
from
agency
and
how
much
comes
from
the
stock
ownership,
you're
going
to
require
a
specially
high
burden
of
proof,
is
that
principally
what
you're
saying?
justice
scalia
so
even
if
it
might
be
enough
if
your
father
did
it
for
you,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
enough
if
a
controlled
corporation
did
it
for
you
because
you
have
no
other
way
of
controlling
your
father,
whereas
you
do
have
another
way
of
controlling
a
controlled
corporation.
justice
scalia
is
that
really
true?
i
mean,
let's
suppose
i
form
a
corporation
in
which
i'm
a
sole
shareholder.
i
just
decide
to
incorporate
my
business.
previously,
i've
been
doing
it
as
just
a
sole
proprietor.
i
incorporate.
i
become
the
chief
executive
officer,
i'm
the
sole
shareholder.
it's
really
me.
i'm
still
making
the
money,
but
i
formed
a
corporation.
now,
who
gets
taxed,
me
or
the
corporation?
justice
scalia
so
the
reality
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
does
it?
the
reality
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
in
that
case,
i'm
really
i'm
the
whole
thing.
i
own
all
the
stock,
i
put
in
all
the
work
and
i
don't
get
taxed.
the
reality
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
all.
we're
dealing
with
an
artificial
creation
here
anyway,
aren't
we?
so
we
just
have
to
decide
what
rules
govern
this
artificial
creation.
justice
scalia
all
right.
so
long
as
we
know
we're
not
talking
about
reality.
justice
scalia
suppose
the
stock
of
this
corporation
had
been
sold
after
it
had
been
set
up
and
the
money
was
coming
in
from
the
properties.
do
you
think
the
shareholder
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
that
money
and
say
it's
money
from
the
property
my
corporation
owns?
justice
scalia
--well,
they
have
to
do
from
year
to
year
for
one
reason
or
another
under
the
tax
laws
or
because
of
my
peculiar
circumstances,
it
becomes
advantageous
from
one
year
to
another
to
shift
the
income
to
the
corporation
or
to
me,
all
i
have
to
do
is
write
up
the
nominee
agreement
with
the
corporation
saying,
you
know,
i'm
the
sole
shareholder.
this
year,
the
income
will
belong
to
the
corporation.
the
next
year,
the
income
will
belong
to
me.
can
i
do
that
from
year
to
year,
and
that's
all
it
takes?
justice
scalia
well,
it's
the
same
thing
here.
it
just
says,
all
the
income
from
this
property
this
next
year
is
going
to
be
mine.
and
you
say,
so
long
as
i
do
that
before
the
tax
year,
it's
okay.
justice
scalia
well,
why
isn't
this
just
as
much?
the
only
reason
the
corporation
is
letting
these
people
have
the
income
is
because
these
people
are
the
sole
shareholders.
you
don't
think
any
corporation
in
its
right
mind
would
say,
well,
we
own
the
property
but
other
people
can
have
the
income.
it's
the
same
thing,
it
seems
to
me.
