chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
westfall
against
irwin
in
no.
86-1672,
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
v.
jesse
c.
bollinger.
mr.
horowitz,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
the
corporation
held
the
title
to
the
property
in
its
own
name,
the
dummy
corporation,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what
this
court
said
was
that
the
code
simply
required
the
taxpayer
to
recognize
the
record
state
of
affairs.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
here
the
dummy
corporation
if
you're
right
in
saying,
it
did
follow
record
state
of
title.
it
reported
income,
did
it
not,
to
itself?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
on
the
partners'
individual
returns.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
income
here
was
received
by
a
partnership,
wasn't
it?
it
wasn't
received
by
the
corporation.
it
was
received
by
creekside
as
cna,
whatever
that
is?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
it
was
creekside
apartments,
a
partnership,
the
account.
am
i
wrong?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
it
wasn't
a
corporate
account?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
this
isn't
certainly
a
direct
parallel
to
moline?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
there,
the
gain
was
recognized
or
property
to
which
the
corporation
held
title.
here,
this
corporation
didn't
receive
the
income.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say,
it
was
quote
attributable
close
quote.
is
that
just
a
descriptive
word
or
is
it
a
word
that
means
something
in
the
irc?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--was
that
paid
out
of
the
cna
account,
the
interest?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
horowitz,
in
arizona
when
i
practiced,
it
was
a
very
common
practice
to
have
subdivision
trusts
where
a
title
company
would
hold
title
to
a
large
piece
of
property
and
charge
virtually
nothing
for
holding
it
because
they
were
going
to
make
their
money
out
of
insuring
titles
in
the
houses
that
were
built
ultimately
on
that
vacant
land.
now,
would
the
government
feel
that
the
title
company
ought
to
have
to
recognize
income
and
losses
on
property,
that
it
held
that
sort
of
nominal
title
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
of
course--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--no,
no.
it's
an
unrelated
corporation
in
one
sense;
it
isn't
the
same
entity,
but
it
has
every
reason
to
cooperate
with
the
subdividers
because
that's
where
it's
going
to
get
its
income
from.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
horowitz.
mr.
hembree,

hear

you

justice

case
