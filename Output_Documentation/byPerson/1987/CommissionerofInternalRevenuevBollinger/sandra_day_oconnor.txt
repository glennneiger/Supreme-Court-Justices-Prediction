justice
o'connor
mr.
horowitz,
do
you
recognize
the
exceptions
spoken
of
in
dicta
in
national
carbide
for
a
true
agent?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
accept
the
explanation
in
national
carbide
of
when
a
true
agency
might
exist?
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
horowitz,
wouldn't
even
in
an
arm's
length
relationship,
the
fee
for
holding
bare
legal
title
seems
to
me
could
be
quite
minimal.
and
i'm
not
sure
i
see
the
significance
of--
justice
o'connor
well,
there
wasn't
an
agency
agreement
in
moline
was
there?
