mr.
ronald
podolsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
deals
with
the
rights
of
a
party
to
seek
redress
of
grievances
for
an
alleged
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
equal
protection
under
the
laws,
under
42
usc
1983,
and
whether
that
right
is
in
any
way
delimited
or
in
any
way
proscribed
by
the
fact
that
somebody
else
started
an
action
relating
to
a
related
condition.
the
evelyn
marino
petitioners
are
police
officers
who
took
the
1983
new
york
city
police
department
promotion
exam
to
sergeant.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
no.
i'm
sorry.
yes,
your
honor.
the
pass
mark
for
that
examination
was
set
at
the
first
thousand
candidates
plus
ties
and
yielded
a
list
of
1,040
candidates.
there
is
an
affidavit
by
the
personnel
director
at
the
fairness
hearing
held
in
the
hispanic
case
that
the
pass
mark
did
not
define
minimum
competency
to
do
the
job
and
this
was
in
response
to
an
objection
by
certain
intervenors
who
represented
ethnic
societies
that
the...
to
promote
the
minority
officers
would
somehow
lead
to
promoting
unqualified
people.
so,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
minority
beneficiaries
of
the
settlement
are
qualified
has
been
decided
and
is
not
in
issue
here.
the
marino
petitioners
have
a
mark
equivalent
to
or
higher
than
the
minority
beneficiaries
of
the
settlement
but
below
the
first
thousand
cut-off.
when
the
racial
remedy
was
employed,
after
the
hispanic
suit
was
instituted
and
settled,
it
turned
out
that
everyone
on
the
list,
that's
the
1,040
original
passers,
plus
all
minority
members
who
would
make
up
the
disparate
impact
perceived
to
have
generated
the
lawsuit
in
the
first
place
were
promoted,
there
were
still
400
vacancies
in
the
rank.
the
marino
petitioners
take
the
position
that
as
long
as
there
were
400
vacancies
in
the
rank,
their
exclusion
by
the
employment
of
the
racial
remedy
was
not
narrowly
tailored
to
prevent
unnecessary
trammeling
of
rights,
and
that
is
the
issue
that
brought
marino
into
court
in
the
first
place.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
the
petitioners
did
not
intervene
in
the
title
vii
litigation,
your
honor,
because
congress
has
provided
a
remedy
of
42
usc
1983
to
deal
with
alleged
violation
of
equal
protection.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
it
was
an
alternate
remedy
and
not
a
required
remedy.
not
a
required
remedy.
now,
if
we
looked
at,
your
honor,--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
--what?
mr.
ronald
podolsky
they
did
not
intervene
because
they
chose
as
their
remedy
a
plenary
action
under
42
usc
1983
which
is
a
remedy
provided
for
congress
specifically
addressed
to
enforcing
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes,
indeed,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
cataloged
in
my
reply
brief,
your
honor.
the
most
important
one,
of
course,
is
that
the
remedy
existed
in
1983.
the
second,
if
a
party
chooses
to
intervene
in
somebody
else's
lawsuit,
their
burden
of
proof
is
different
on
some...
in
many
respects
from
the
1983
action.
the
2nd
circuit,
for
example,
sometimes
limits
intervenors
to
just
whether
or
not
there's
a
fairness
in
the
proposed
settlement.
now,
in
1983,
you
don't
have
to
go
into
whether
or
not
the
racial
remedy
was
or
was
not
appropriate.
one
of
the
most
important
considerations,
your
honor,
in
answer
to
your
question
is
that
the
intervention
provision,
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
24,
i
believe,
and
i
think
the
11th
circuit
bears
me
out,
is
for
people
that
have
no
other
remedy.
now,
for
example,
the
schneider
intervenors,
they
represented
the
ethnic
societies,
were
they
attempting
to
get
a
passing
grade
here?
no.
were
they
attempting
to
get
promoted?
their
objection
was
we
are
police
officers,
and
if
you
lower
the
mark
for
the
beneficiaries
of
the
settlement,
we
are
going
to
be
supervised
by
unqualified
people.
they
did
not
have
a
fourteenth
amendment
provision,
and
frcp
24
provides
for
a
person
without
a
remedy
to
seek
redress
of
an
objection
that
they
have.
no
remedy,
no
specific
statute
giving
rise
to
a
plenary
action.
now,
the
marino
people,
they
brought
their
action
and
it
was
dismissed
as
an
impermissible
collateral
attack
on
a
proposed
settlement,
not
a
judgment,
a
proposed
settlement.
where
did
the
2nd
circuit
get
the
idea
of
impermissible
collateral
attack
leading
to
inconsistent
results?
that's
the
verbiage
of
the
rule
19.
rule
19
makes
it
the
duty
of
the
people
who
feel
they're
going
to
be
subjected
to
duplication
of
effort
to
inconsistent
results.
it
puts
the
burden
on
them
when
somebody
asserts
a
claim,
not
has
a
claim,
rule
19
says
a
person
who
claims
an
interest
in
an
action,
which
may
lead
to
inconsistent
results,
the
people
who
are
at
risk,
the
parties
who
may
be
subjected
to
inconsistent
results,
have
a
duty,
not
the
people
who
brought
the
1983
action,
but
the
people
of
the
lawsuit
have
a
duty
to
plead,
to
join,
and
let's
see
how
strong
that
requirement
is.
rule
19.
persons
to
be
joined
if
feasible.
now,
the
fact
was
that
they
were
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
we're
not
involved
with
the
jurisdiction
over
the
person.
the
person
claims,
not
has
a
claim
that
he
doesn't
assert,
he
must
claim
an
interest,
let
the
folks
know
i
have
an
interest
i
am
pursuing,
he
claims
an
interest
relating
to
the
subject
of
the
action,
his
1983
action
is
authorized
by
congress,
enforcement
of
your
equal
protection
rights,
and
is
so
situated
that
the
disposition
of
the
action
may
in
the
person's
absence...
now
here's
where
we're
talking,
subdivision
2,
leave
any
of
the
persons
already
parties
subject
to--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
i'll
use
the
sergeant's
benevolent
association
brief,
page
3.
i
intend
to
use
their
brief
because
they
have
more
sections
cited.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes,
indeed.

of
the
page,
your
honor,
(ii).
leave
any
of
the
persons
already
parties,
these
are
the
hispanic
litigants,
subject
to
a
substantial
risk
of
incurring
double,
multiple
or
otherwise
inconsistent
obligation
by
reasons
of
the
claimed
interest.
now,
look
how
strong
this
is.
if
the
person
has
not
been
so
joined,
the
court
shall
order
the
person
to
be
made
a
party.
they
go
even
further.
if
the
person
should
join
as
a
plaintiff
but
refuses
to
do
so,
the
person
may
be
made
a
defendant
or
in
a
proper
case
an
involuntary
plaintiff.
now,
justice
scalia,
one
of
the
other
reasons
is
marino
was
not
attacking
the
promotions.
they
took
the
position
that
the
minority
beneficiaries
were
qualified
to
hold
the
position
and
this
was
confirmed
by
the
personnel
director.
do
we
go
in
as
a
plaintiff?
do
we
go
in
supporting
the
settlement
but
saying
we
also
must
be
included
because
we're
qualified
and
there
are
vacancies
and
the
remedy
is
not
tailored?
are
we
pulled
in
as
a
defendant
or
do
we
pursue
the
right
to
go
in
1983
as
congress
says
and
let
them
make
the
determination
to
bring
us
in?
no
defendant
wants
to
be...
no
person
wants
to
be
made
a
party
to
a
litigation
against
his
will,
but
congress
gave
the
hispanic
litigants
the
power
and
opportunity
to
do
that,
like
they
would
any
other
defendant.
now,
a
consent
decree
is
only
binding
on
people
who
consent.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes,
indeed.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
i
do
not
attack
the
settlement,
except
that
it
is
not
narrowly
construed
to
prevent
unnecessary
exclusion.
there
were
400
vacancies
in
the
rank
after
the
remedy
was
employed.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
a
medical
school,
your
honor,
has
fifty
seats
and
500
applicants
where
you
must
exclude
people.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
qualified
people.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
not
only
after
it
was
entered,
but
after
it
was
employed
and
put
into
effect.
yes,
indeed.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
this
is
an
unusual
case.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
they
benefitted
the
clients,
my
clients,
and
i'm
the
first
to
say
it.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
it's
a
puzzling
case,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
we
are
perfectly
happy
with
the--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
--finding
that
the
minority
beneficiaries
of
the
settlement
were
qualified
to
fill
the
rank
of
sergeant
and
that
there
are
sufficient
vacancies
beyond
that
where
people
who
outscored
them
can
also
be
accommodated,
and
if
you
don't
accommodate
them,
they
are
being
unnecessarily
excluded.
see,
my
clients
were
out--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
--unnecessary
exclusion
from
the
400
vacancies,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
by
the
implementation
of
the
consent
decree.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
i
am...
we
sought
modification,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
it
is
not
an
attack.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
by
the
way,
your
honor,
it
was
not
a
consent
decree
when
we
started
our
litigation.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes.
but
an
attack
on
the
consent
decree
is
permissible.
justice
o'connor
has
suggested
that
in
her
opinion.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
no,
no,
no.
the
explanation--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
--i
did
not
attack...
i
did
not
intervene
in
the
action
because
i
made
an
election
of
the
remedies
that
congress
gave
me
for
vindicating
the
unequal
protection
of
the
laws
where
people
of
similar
qualifications
were
excluded
unnecessarily.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
that's
right.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
they
were
excluded
from
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
new
york
state,
your
honor,
defines
equal
protection
in
the
competitive
exams
and
say
insofar
as
practicable,...
i'm
sorry.
insofar
as
practicable,
promotions
in
the
civil
service
shall
be
made
based
on
merit
and
fitness
to
be
determined
insofar
as
practicable
by
a
competitive
examination.
that
is
the
definition
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
new
york
state
as
far
as
civil
promotions
are
concerned.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
that's
right.
and
the
federal
constitutional
claim
is
that
citizens
be
accorded
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
they
define
it
for
the
purposes
of,
and
so
does
the
court,
so
does
the
federal
court,
in
defining
what
equal
protection
is
in
a
state.
they
rely
on
the
state's
statutes
and
highest
tribunal
decisions,
and
it
has
been
held
that
that
can
be
binding
on
this
court.
justice
o'connor
has
suggested
in
her
concurring
opinion,
of
course,
in
the
cleveland
firefighters
case,
that
consent
decrees
are
subject
to
collateral...
to
attack
if
they
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
component.
the...
what
happened
during
the
litigation
was
the
marino
suit
was
instituted
before
the
consent
decree
was
even
scheduled
for
a
fairness
hearing.
now,
in
order
for
something
to
be
inconsistent
with
something
else,
there
must
be
a
constant
against
which
it
is
measured.
for
example,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
a
constant.
if
a
statute
violates
it,
it's
inconsistent
and
is
declared
unconstitutional.
a
statute,
which
is
violated
by
inconsistent
action,
is
illegal.
a
judgment
under
certain
circumstances
is
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
stability
and
if
it's
undermined
a
judgment.
now,
a
final
judgment,
under
certain
circumstances,
where
due
process
is
had,
is
entitled
to
a
certain
degree
of
stability
as
well.
what
we
had
here,
what
they
say
was
being
attacked
was
a
proposal
subject
to
a
fairness
hearing.
now,
was
this
fairness
hearing
a
charade,
a
stroking
exercise?
was
it
a
foregone
conclusion?
suppose
the
district
court
had
rejected
it?
suppose
they
said,
podolsky,
you're
right,
they
can't
exclude
your
people
from
those
400
vacancies,
this
would
be
not
a
narrow
tailoring.
that
was
a
proposal.
it
was
not
a
judgment.
it
was
not
a
consent
decree,
and
when
the
district
court
dismissed
the
marino
case,
it
took
the
court
awhile
to
decide
to
dismiss
it,
the
motion
was
made
before
the
fairness
hearing
and
dismissed
after,
the
court
relied
on
prate
v.
freedman.
prate
v.
freedman
is
a
case
where
there
was
an
attack
on
a
consent
decree
a
year
after
it
was
entered.
in
our
situation,
all
we
had
was
an
informal--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
the
2nd
circuit,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
well,
i'm
saying
the
judge
below,
your
honor,
the
district
court
judge
cited
only
one
case
in
showing
why
he
is
dismissing
the
marino
case.
he
cited
prate
v.
freedman.
that
was
his
sole
basis.
it
was
a
memorandum
endorsement,
your
honor.
case
dismissed,
prate
v.
freedman,
2nd
circuit.
prate
v.
freedman,
you
pull
down
the
book
and
what
do
you
find,
it
was
a
consent
decree
a
year
old
where
people
came
in
a
year
later
and
tried
to
undo
what
was
done.
certainly,
that's
an
attack,
a
collateral
attack.
i
don't
even
think
it's
impermissible,
but
it's
a
collateral
attack
on
a
consent
decree,
entitled
to
some
sort
of
stability
here.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes.
the
five
minute
light,
indeed.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
well,
it's
been
on
for
awhile.
now,
i'm
really
in
trouble.
in
any
event,
six
months
after
the
final
decree
is
entered,
the
state
supreme
court
comes
down
with
a
decision
giving
me
eleven
changes
on
the
merits
of
whether
the
questions
were
job-related
or
not,
and
i
wrote
in
my
brief
what
judge
blin
said
about
the
case.
as
a
result
of
these
changes,
some
of
the
very
minorities
perceived
to
have
failed
and
made
sergeants
under
the
decree
now
had
a
passing
grade
on
their
own
merit.
they're
walking
around
trying
to
explain
to
people
why
they
shouldn't
be
stigmatized.
i
made
sergeant
on
my
own.
you
see.
everybody's
referring
to
them
as
"sergeants".
the
stigma
attached
here
can
be
eliminated
by
treating
everyone
who
passed
this
exam
equally
and
giving
the
minority
beneficiaries
a
time
preference
if,
in
fact,
there
is
a
racial
remedy
required.
time
preference
is
less
onerous
than
outright
exclusion
of
equally-qualified
people.
that's
our
point.
there
was
no
impermissible
collateral
attack
on
an
existing
judgment
or
consent
decree.
when
the
marino
case
was
instituted,
it
was
merely
an
agreement
between
an
employer
and
the
employee
with
some
of
his
people,
and
as
i
stated
in
the
beginning,
a
consent
decree
by
definition
is
not
binding
on
the
people
who
did
not
consent
to
it.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
i
don't
believe
i
have
the
time,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
i'll
take
it
if
you
give
it
to
me.
