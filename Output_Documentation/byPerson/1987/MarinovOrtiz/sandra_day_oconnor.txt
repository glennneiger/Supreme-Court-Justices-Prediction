justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
podolsky,
why
didn't
the
petitioners
intervene
in
a
title
vii
litigation?
justice
o'connor
well,
certainly
the
point
that
you
argue
on
the
merits
could
have
been
raised
in
that
litigation.
justice
o'connor
so,
why
didn't
you?
justice
o'connor
why
did
the
petitioners
not
intervene
in
the
title
vii
litigation?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
koerner,
that
action
was
brought
before
the
consent
decree
was
filed,
and--
justice
o'connor
--it
seems
to
me
that
given
the
mandatory
language
of
title
19,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
at
that
point
why
the
burden
shouldn't
fall
on
the
parties
in
the
title
vii
litigation
to
force
a
mandatory
intervention
if
they
wanted
it.
i
just
fail
to
see
why
the
burden
should
be
on
these
people
to
intervene.
justice
o'connor
you
had
notice.
justice
o'connor
so,
why
didn't
you
force
them
to
join?
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
you
had
under
title
19
language,
the
duty,
to
get
them
to
intervene
and
get
that
settled
if
that
was
your
concern.
