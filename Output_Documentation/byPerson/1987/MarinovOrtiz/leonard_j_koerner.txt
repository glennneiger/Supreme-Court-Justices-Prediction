mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
every
circuit
in
the
country,
with
the
exception
of
one,
has
upheld
the
principle
against
collateral
attacks,
and
the
reason
for
that,
as
justice
marshall
indicated,
is
in
the
interest
of
judicial
economy,
to
avoid
inconsistent
results,
and
also
to
put
a
case
to
rest.
the
absence
of
finality
would
be
most
devastating
to
title
vii
litigation.
if
you
review
the
birmingham,
alabama,--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--your
honor
is
quite
correct,
and
what
we
are
urging
is
that
there
are
policy
considerations
in
this
type
of
litigation
that
make
the
literal
application
of
rule
19
inappropriate,
in
that
we
believe
rule
19
is
not
to
be
read
in
isolation,
that
it
must
be
considered
along
with
other
rules,
including
the
rules
of
intervention.
with
respect
to
inconsistent
judgments,
as
justices
here
questioned
the
petitioners,
in
this
case,
the
two
judgments
could
not
co-exist.
the
petitioners
are
asking
for
additional
appointments
to
their
clientele
which
would
consist
of
primarily
non-minorities.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
because,
your
honor,
any
relief
that
we
granted
that
class
would
have
affected
the
consent
decree,
because
assuming
there
were
vacancies,
there
were
two
considerations.
first,
would
the
city
have
consented
to
this
consent
decree
if
it
understood
that
it
would
have
to
make
all
these
additional
appointments
and
foreclose
opportunities
for
people
taking
the
next
sergeant's
exam?
second,
with
respect
to
this
group,
if
we
did
appoint
this
group
and
the
vast
majority
of
which
were
non-minorities,
based
on
the
quota,
we
would
then
have
to
appoint
additional
minorities
to
preserve
the
very
quota
that
we
established.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
in
any
case?
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
in
this
particular
case,
we
would
say
in
answer
to
your
question
that
you
have
to
intervene
from
that
moment
in
time
when
you
believe
that
a
consent
decree
could
be
entered
in
that
case
and
when
your
cause
of
action
arises
solely
from
the
consent
decree.
if
it's
the
w.r.
grace
issue,
where
you're
asserting
an
independent
contractual
right,
we
would
not
argue
you
have
to
intervene.
but
i
think
if
i
could,
your
honor,
to
address
your
issue,
although
i
wanted
to
deal
with
the
bigger
issue,
i
would
like
to
go
over
the
chronology
here,
so
you
understand
this
is
not
a
case
of
someone
who
was
surprised
and
sought
to
bring
a
new
action
because
they
felt
they
were
being
treated
unfairly.
this
is
a
case
of
someone
who
sat
on
a
sideline,
participated
in
a
limited
way
in
the
consent
decree
litigation,
and
then
brought
a
separate
action
which
had
no
other
effect
than
to
sow
confusion
on
the
issue.
in
1984,
when
the
title
vii
litigation
was
commenced,
at
the
same
time
this
same
attorney
had
been
retained
by
the
same
petitioners
to
bring
a
state
court
proceeding
to
challenge
the
answers
selected
by
the
department
of
personnel.
if
he
succeeded
and
showed
that
his
answers
were
as
good
as
or
better
than
the
answers
selected
by
the
department
of
personnel,
it
was
quite
likely
that
a
significant
number
of
people
that
he
represents
would
be
on
the
very
eligible
list
that
was
already
involved
in
the
consent
decree
litigation.
as
the
discovery
phase
was
proceeding,
the
petitioners
had
every
obligation
to
monitor
it
closely
because
they
knew
part
of
their
group
would
always
be
affected.
indeed,
in
the
end
of
november,
when
the
interim
order
was
entered
establishing
a
quota
for
the
first
time,
the
petitioners
were
aware
of
it.
then,
they
knew
it
would
affect
them
because
to
the
extent
a
quota
was
granted...
was
effected,
it
would
have
affect
their
individuals
because
they
had
scored
equal
to
or
better
than
all
the
people
who
were
the
recipients
of
the
quota.
but,
instead
of
intervening,
they
brought
a
federal
1983
action,
alleging
the
same
operative
facts
and
the
same
cause
of
action
as
was
involved
in
the
consent
decree
action.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
your
honor,
in
answer--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--we
had
notice.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
because
we
believed
that
all
the
people
that
had
a
substantial
interest
in
the
litigation
were
already
there.
there
had
been
three
separate
interventions
by
representatives
of
non-minorities
who
were
on
the
eligible
list
in
addition
to
the
plaintiffs
and
the
city
defendants.
in
addition,
when
they
filed
their
federal
complaint,
we
moved
to
dismiss
telling
them
that
the
law
of
the
2nd
circuit
at
that
time
was
you
could
not
collaterally
attack
and
that
since
your
complaint
was
filed
after
the
first
interim
order
and
since
the
object
of
the
complaint
would
be
to
render
a
judgment
which
would
be
inconsistent
with
any
judgment
rendered
in
the
consent
decree
litigation,
we
suggested
to
them
that
they
intervene.
what
was--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--that
is
correct.
if
it
was
feasible
and
if
we
believed
they
had
a
substantial
enough
interest
to
warrant
their
compulsory
participation
in
the
case.
what
was
their
interest?
they
were
not
on
the
eligible
list.
they
had
no
expectancy
of
employment
appointments.
all
they
were...
they
were
in
the
exact
same
position
before
the
consent
decree
was
entered
as
after.
their
only
injury
was
the
same
injury
as
any
other
non-minority
in
effectuating
a
quota.
what
makes
this
quota
even
more
limited
is
that
it
was
given
only
to
the
victims
of
discrimination.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
we're
also
telling
you
that
in
cases
like
this,
it
ought
to
be
up
to
the
participants
in
the
collateral
attack
to
determine
where
to
go.
may
i
just
finish,
your
honor?
in
addition,
they
did
participate.
after
we
told
them
to
intervene,
justice
o'connor,
this
also
applies
to
your
question,
after
we
told
them
to
intervene,
they
filed
both
written
and
oral
objections
to
the
consent
decree.
they
did
everything
but
formally
file
a
motion.
so,
the
question
is
whether
the
state
of
mind
of
all
the
parties,
which
included
the
intervenors
as
such,
that
they
would
have
thought
that
all
of
this
participation
and
the
contestation
of
the
objections
was
not
enough,
and
i
submit
to
you
that
we
did
act
reasonably.
we
thought
they
had
participated.
indeed,
after
this
case
was
concluded,
they
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
argued
they
were
a
party
to
the
litigation.
based
on
what
we
should
have
expected
and
what
they
did,
i
think
the
participants
here
acted
quite
reasonably.
did
we
treat
him
fairly?
i
believe
so.
we
told
him
what
the
law
was
in
the
2nd
circuit.
he
knew
he
couldn't
collaterally
attack.
it
was
up
to
him,
it
would
appear
to
us,
to
determine
whether
he
wanted--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--no.
our
position
would
be,
your
honor,
if
you
have
an
obligation
to
intervene,
because
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
and
you
fail
to
exercise
that
obligation,
you
can
be
precluded
in
another
litigation
from
litigating
the
issues
that
arise--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--provident
bank
and
the
penncentral
merger
and
inclusion
cases,
and
that
philosophy
was
upheld
by
three
circuits.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
both
cases.
they
suggested
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
transactions,
the
complexity
of
the
litigation,
there
can
come
to
be
a
point
where
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
people
who
have
tenuous
interests
at
most
should
have
an
obligation
to
intervene,
and
we
believe
in
this
situation,
when
we
called
to
his
attention
the
law
of
the
circuit
and
told
him
that
this
was
an
indirect
impermissible
attack,
i
won't
use
the
word
"collateral",
and
when
he
did,
in
fact,
participate
through
the
objection
process
and
when
his
cause
of
action
arose
directly
out
of
the
consent
decree,--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--no,
no.
it
just...
it
tells...
no.
we're
not
arguing
that
prate
was
decided
correctly,
although
we
believe
it
was.
we
are
just
pointing
out
that
having
retained
an
attorney
who
was
familiar
with
the
process
and
having
participated
to
some
limited
degree
in
our
consent
decree
litigation,
there
was
no
reason
for
him
not
to
intervene,
except
to
create
confusion,
when
he
had
every
reason
to
suspect
that
his
indirect
attack
would
not
be
successful.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
in
effect,
if
the
2nd
circuit
had
said
collateral
attacks
would
be
okay
under
the
circumstances,
we
would
still
argue
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
it
would
have
been
inappropriate
for
him
to
participate
as
an
objector
and
then
bring
another
proceeding
without
attacking
head-on
the
consent
decree
litigation.
but
if
the
2nd
circuit
had
issued
a
different
opinion
in
prate,
it
might
jeopardize
the
general
rule,
which
is
thought
to
be
an
issue
before
this
court
now,
and
that
is
whether
a
collateral
attack
will
ever
be
permissible
in
title
vii
litigation
because
it
contravenes
the
policy
of
title
vii,
the
finality
and
consent.
if
i
might,
i'd
like
to
address
the
broader
issue
because
the
solicitor
general
did
address
it.
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
process,
in
all
of
these
hiring
cases,
the
people
who
are
grieved
are
usually
very
numerous.
they
are
people
who
are
injured
no
differently
than
anybody
else
as
a
result
of
quotas,
and
the
question
is
under
rule
19,
who
should
have
the
burden.
ought
to
it
be
the
parties
and
require
these
people
to
intervene?
in
this
case,
in
theory
from
the
outside,
if
you
carry
petitioner's
argument
forward,
we
would
have
had
to
been
required
to
intervene
at
least
ten
thousand
non-minority
officers
to
assure
ourselves
that
we
would
have
claimed
preclusion.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
it's
only
remarkable
in
the
context
of
the
facts
of
title
vii
litigation
and
the
public
policy
which
supports
consent
decrees.
indeed,
this
court
on
at
least
two--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--no,
but
public
policy
has
caused
courts
to
construe
procedural
statutes
in
a
way
as
not
to
do
an
injustice
to
the
policies
set
forth
in
the
statute
you're
trying
to
interpret.
if,
by
removing
finality
from
the
cause
of
action,
you
so
undermine
consent
decree
litigation
that
you
frustrate
title
vii,
then
it
would
appear
to
me
you
should
consider
not
just
rule
19
but
the
other
rules.
indeed,
that's
precisely
what
was
done
in
provident
bank
and
penncentral,
and,
in
addition,
in
other
cases
involving
title
vii,
this
court
has
held
that
certain
aspects
of
remedies
might
be
more
appropriate,
as
your
honor
is
familiar
with,
in
consensual
litigation
than
would
be
appropriate
in
litigating
litigation.
in
addition,--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--no.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
our
argument,
your
honor,
presumes
the
parties
who
are
aggrieved
have
actual
notice
of
the
litigation
and
the
consent
decree
problem
and
had
an
opportunity
to
intervene.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes.
that
would
be
a
tougher
case
and
would
not
as
clearly
fall
within
collateral
attack,
but
in
this
case,
the
only
differentiation
between
filing
it
after
the
final
judgment
and
the
facts
here
is
that
he
filed
it
after
the
interim
order.
he
knew
the
consent
decree
was
an
issue.
more
importantly,
after
his
case
was
dismissed
in
april,
he
still
had
two
months
to
move
to
intervene
and
ask
for
an
adjournment
on
the
consent
decree
and
present
his
arguments
on
the
merits.
we
do
not
believe
that
once
you
get
wind
that
you
are
negotiating
consent
decree
that
merely
by
the
filing
of
a
complaint
you
can
interrupt
the
consent
decree
judgment
and
effect
all
the
policy
reasons
why
you
want
consent
decrees
in
the
first
place.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
your
honor,
i
understand
your
position,
and
in
private
litigation,
that
is
the
case,
and
in
public
litigation,
that
could
be
the
case,
but
there
are
circumstances
under
which,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
interests
and
because
the
parties
are
so
numerous,
that
it
could
be
the
understanding
of
all
the
parties
and
the
court
that
if
people
believe
they
had
a
sufficient
interest
in
the
controversy,
they
would
intervene
under
the
circumstances.
indeed,
if
you'll
look
at
the
survey
of
cases
throughout
the
country,
the
reason
why
collateral
attacks
have
been
uniformly
rejected,
except
for
one
circuit
that
i'll
discuss
in
a
minute,
is
because
of
the
protracted
process
of
title
vii
litigation,
and
the
fact
that
all
interested
people
do
participate,
that
because
the
numbers
of
people
affected
are
so
numerous,
they
do
not
have
any
trouble
retaining
an
attorney
and
this
case
is
an
example.
he
sued
in
state
court.
he
brought
a
1983
action.
he
certainly
was
retained
for
all
purposes
and
he
could
have
every
easily
participated
in
the
litigation.
the
11th
circuit
in
jefferson
county,
where
they
have
recognized
collateral
attacks,
the
result
has
been
a
quota
that
has
been
under
attack
for
over
ten
years.
despite
the
fact
that
the
people
who
are
now
attacking
the
quota
stand
in
no
different
position
than
the
people
who
were
aggrieved
at
the
inception
of
the
quota.
they're
affected
by
the
quota
the
way
everybody
else
is
affected,
that
when
you
hire
minorities,
you
exclude
non-minorities.
but
that
has
been
upheld.
it's
a
rational
exercise
of
the
power
of
the
lower
court,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
permit
the
constant
challenges
when
you
do
have
a
reasonable
alternative
and
that
is
intervention.
i
want
to
deal
with
the
second
issue
because
although
it
was
not
certified,
it
was
raised
in
part
by
the
justice
department,
and
that
has
to
do
with
mr.
podolsky's
appeal
from
the
consent
decree
litigation.
after
the
objections
and
an
order
was
entered
approving
the
consent
decree,
two
appeals
were
filed.
one
from
the
dismissal
of
the
federal
1983
action
and
one
from
the
dismissal
of
the
consent
decree.
the
circuit
court,
and
we
believe
correctly,
that
since
mr.
podolsky
never
chose
to
become
a
party
through
his
petitioners
to
the
litigation,
he
cannot
appeal,
and
that
is
well
established
in
this
court.
it
emphasizes,
however,
the
point
we've
been
trying
to
make.
he
obviously
was
alert
to
the
loss
of
his
rights
in
the
consent
decree
litigation
because
he
filed
the
notice.
what
makes
his
practices
more
incomprehensible
is
that
a
notice
of
appeal
was
also
filed
by
the
one
intervenor
that
did
not
support
the
quotas,
the
schneider
group.
he
had
constantly
from
day
one
opposed
the
quota.
he
withdrew
that
appeal.
so,
mr.
podolsky
knew
that
the
only
other
non-minority
party
on
appeal
had
withdrawn.
despite
that,
he
still
did
not
move
to
intervene
in
the
appellate
court
and
ask
for
permission,
and
we
believe
that
what
he
has
done
here
has
placed
himself
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
and
that
there
was
an
easy
avenue
of
approach
which
he
chose
not
to
use,
and
for
all
those
reasons,
we
ask
that
the
orders
be
affirmed.
