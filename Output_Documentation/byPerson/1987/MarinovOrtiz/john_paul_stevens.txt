justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question?
justice
stevens
are
you
telling
me
that...
you
say
that
you
didn't
know
whether
you
would
support
or
attack
the
settlement
if
you
did
go
in.
does
that
mean
you
do
not
attack
the
settlement?
justice
stevens
are
you
saying--
justice
stevens
--there
are
400
vacancies
after
the
consent
decree
was
entered?
justice
stevens
so
that
the--
justice
stevens
--so,
the
consent
decree
does
not...
you're
not
claiming
the
consent
decree
harmed
your
clients
in
any
way
then.
justice
stevens
i
must
confess
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
what's
going
on.
justice
stevens
but,
then,
we
start
from
the
proposition
that
you're
perfectly
happy
with
the
settlement?
justice
stevens
the
consent
decree.
justice
stevens
mr.
podolsky,
i
thought
your
explanation
for
not
intervening
was
that
you
didn't
want
to
attack
the
settlement.
justice
stevens
you
did
want
to
attack
the
settlement,
then
why
didn't
you
intervene
and
attack
the
settlement
in
that
proceeding?
justice
stevens
but
you
just
told
me
a
minute
ago
they
weren't
excluded
because
there
were
400
extra
vacancies
that
your
clients
could
have
filled.
justice
stevens
so,
how
were
they
excluded?
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt?
is
it
conceivable
that
you
would
have
a
sufficient
interest
to
mount
a
collateral
attack
on
a
judgment
in
a
case
and
yet
not
have
a
sufficient
interest
to
intervene
in
the
case?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
justice
stevens
but
they
had
to
do
that
to
decide
whether
to
file
the
lawsuit.
justice
stevens
well,
normally,
you
start
the
time
clock
running
when
you
get
notice
of
whatever
it
is
that
hurts
you,
and
presumably
as
soon
as
they
found
out
about
this
settlement,
they
realized
that
it
adversely
affected
their
interest,
and
they
must
have
been
intimately
acquainted
with
what
was
going
on.
they
all
took
the
exam.
it's
not
like
they're
some
strangers
from
a
foreign
country.
justice
stevens
and
they
would
have
made
the
same
claim
if
there
had
not
been
these
extra
400
slots?
