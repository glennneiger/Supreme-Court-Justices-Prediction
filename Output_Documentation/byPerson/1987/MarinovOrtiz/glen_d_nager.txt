mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
o'connor
has
asked
a
question
that
probably
occurred
to
all
of
us,
why
didn't
the
petitioners
in
this
case
intervene.
the
fact
that
that
question
occurs
to
all
of
us,
though,
is
a
question
that
we
would
like
to
suggest
is
not
a
question
that
the
district
court
should
be
asking
of
litigants
who
bring
subsequent
lawsuits,
challenging
actions
that
existed
in
prior
lawsuits,
and
our
reason
for
that
is
it
would
be
both
unfair
and
would
produce
an
inefficient
allocation
of
society's
and
judicial
resources
in
the
subsequent
lawsuits.
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
it's
in
the
interest
of
fairness
and
in
the
interest
of
judicial
economy
for
everyone
who
has
a
sufficient
interest
in
a
piece
of
litigation
to
be
made
party
of
that
litigation
and
be
bound
by
that
litigation.
but
it's
also
true
that
the
same
fairness
concerns
and
those
same
economy
concerns
counsel
that
when
a
person
doesn't
have
a
sufficient
interest
in
a
piece
of
litigation,
that
he
not
be
made
party
and
that
he
not
participate
in
it
because
his
participation
would
confuse
and
complicate
the
litigation
needlessly.
the
problem
comes...
and
it's
easy
to
say
those
two
generalities
in
the
abstract,
what's
more
difficult
is
analyzing
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
you
have
a
sufficient
interest
to
justify
being
a
party
in
that
litigation,
and
until
a
court
answers
that
question
for
you,
you
won't
know,
and
the
problem
is
that
there
is
a
risk
of
error
of
mistake,
and
the
question
should
be
who
can
best
bear
the
burden
of
those
mistakes
of
thinking
i
didn't
have
a
sufficient
interest
to
intervene,
so
i
didn't,
or
i
had
other
reasons
for
not
intervening,
and
i
didn't
want
to,
and
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
wisely,
we
think,--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--probably
not,
justice
stevens.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
question,
though,
is
should
that
question
be
asked
of
someone
who
doesn't
intervene,
and
we
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
inefficient
to
create
a
rule
of
law
of
that
sort.
the
reason
being
is
that
many
people
don't
have
counsel
on
an
on-going
basis
and
aren't
in
the
position
of
monitoring
on-going
litigation.
if
that
litigation
may
be
effecting
their
interests
and
the
fact
that
they
haven't
intervened
may
mean
that
they
didn't
have
counsel
at
the
time
who
told
them.
they
may
know
about
the
litigation.
they
may
not
understand
the
litigation.
the
rules
of
federal
procedure
say
put
the
burden
on
the
parties
to
the
litigation.
if
they
want
to
bind
those
people
who
haven't
intervened,
then
join
them.
that's
the
burden
the
rule
19
places,
and
we
think
it's
a
wise
one
because
it
would
be
inefficient
for
all
of
us
to
have
to
continually
retain
counsel
to
evaluate
litigation
to
know
whether
or
not
we
should
intervene.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
they
did,
but
the
question
is
when.
here,
after
they
learned
about
the
lawsuit,--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that's
true,
justice
stevens.
they
aren't
strangers
from
a
foreign
country,
and
they
were
aware
of
the
litigation,
and
when
you
look
at
the...
and
they
had
counsel.
a
lot
of
people
don't
have
counsel.
yet,
they
may
still
know
that
the
litigation
is
going
on
and
they
may
not
know
that
they
have
to
intervene,
and
they
shouldn't
have
to
intervene.
if
they
don't
intervene,
what
you
have
is
you
have
these
kinds
of
cases
where
we're
looking
back
in
retrospect
asking
whether
or
not
they
had
sufficient
notice,
whether
or
not
at
the
time
they
had
that
notice
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
them,
and
whether
or
not
their
interest
was
sufficiently
implicated
in
retrospect
to
have
required
them
to
have
intervened
to
protect
their
rights.
the
parties
to
the
litigation,
however,
are
more
familiar
with
the
complaints,
more
familiar
with
the
pleadings,
more
familiar
with
the
relief
that
they
expect
to
ask
the
court
to
award
or
in
the
case
of
the
consent
decree
to
approve,
and
they're
in
the
best
position
of
bearing
the
burden
of
not
having
made
someone
a
party
to
the
litigation.
it
will
expend
judicial
resources,
we
think,
more
in
the
long
run
to
engage
in
these
inquiry,
retrospective
inquiries
as
to
whether
or
not
someone
has
sufficient
notice
to
have
required
them
to
have
intervened
and
thus
they're
precluded
from
not
having
intervened.
now,
from
just
placing
the
burden
on
the
existing
parties
to
the
lawsuit
to
file
a
rule
19(c)
which
says
that
they
should
list
everyone
who
may
have
an
interest
and
is
affected
by
the
litigation
so
that
the
court
can
evaluate
whether
or
not
those
litigants
should
be
joined.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
when
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
city
defendants
clearly
understood
that
it
would
affect
the
interests
of
individuals
who
were
already
on
the
eligibility
list
because
they
pled
and
asked
that
the
case
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
enjoin.
we
believe
that
the
first
time
at
which
it
would
have
been
clear,
probably
clear,
that
the
petitioners'
interests
were
affected
would
have
been
at
the
time
that
the
court
approved,
i
believe
it
was
in
november
of
1985,
a
race-conscious
implementation
of
provisional
promotions.
at
that
time,--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
the
consent
decree
itself
was
not
entered
until
june
of
'86,
but
there
were
provisional
promotions
entered
pursuant
to
interim
orders
of
the
court,
and
that
was
the
first
instance
at
which
race-conscious
relief
was
entered,
and
that
would
have
been
at
the
first
time
at
which
the
equal
protection
rights
of
mr.
podolsky's
clients
could
have
been
implicated.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
this
particular
consent
decree
had
already
hurt
his
clients
because
they
had
already
been
not
given
a
promotion
that
other
individuals
were
given
a
promotion,
only
because
of
their
race.
these...
all
of
his
clients
were
equal
to
or
higher
than
one
or
more
of
the
minorities
who
were
given
the
promotion
on
the
eligibility
list.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
initial
1983
action
was
filed,
i
believe,
in
december
of
1985.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
right.
because,
as
i
said,
in
november
of
1985,
there
were
provisional
promotions
given.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
we
take
the
position--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--we
think
that--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--we
think
that's
what
the
federal
rules
allow,
but
the
federal
rules
also
require--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i'm
sorry,
justice
marshall?
mr.
glen
d.
nager
when
congress
created
two
separate
rights,--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--not
two
bites
at
the
cherry.
two
different
litigants
raising
two
different
kinds
of
claims.
it's
two
bites
of
the
city
defendant
and
that's
why
the
city
defendant
should
have
joined
all
employees
would
have
been
affected
by
their
actions.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes,
they
could
have
intervened.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
believe
so,
yes,
they
could
have.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
because
if
you
create
that
rule,
you
will
be
creating
a
system
in
which
people
have
to
continually
monitor
litigation
and
intervene
at
the
first
instance
that
they
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
it
may
affect
their
interests
because
if
they
by-pass
that
opportunity--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--no.
it's
just
in
our
view
a
question
of
who
the
burden
should
be
put
on
for
getting
them
into
that
litigation
so
that
it
can
all
be
done
economically,
and
we're
suggesting
that
the
most
efficient
way
and--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--you
are
absolutely
right,
and
we
agree
with
that.
our
only
point
is
that
the
burden
of
deciding
who...
those
occasions
on
which
one
suit
is
better
than
two
is
to
the
court
who's
handling
the
first
case
and
to
the
parties
who
have
filed
the
complaint
and
filed
the
answer
in
the
first
complaint.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
you'd
rather
try
one.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
occurred
some
time
after,
i
believe,
some
time
after
the
implementation
of
the
provisional
promotions,
which
would
have
been
some
time
after
november
of
1985.
but
as
we
read
their
complaint,
justice
scalia,
they
have
challenged
the
fact
that
they
were
at
a
certain
point
on
the
eligibility
list
and
they
were
not
given
promotions
at
the
same
time
that
people
who
were
lower
than
they
were
on
the
promotion
list
were
promoted
and
that
the
distinguishing
factor
between
them
was
solely
and
exclusively
race.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
as
i
say,
as
we
read
the
complaint,
i
can
only
tell
you
what
i
think
they're
claiming
from
their
complaint,
and
mr.
podolsky
is
their
lawyer,
he
may
take
a
different
view
now
than
he
did
then
or
he
may
have
had
a
different
view
all
along,
i
can
just
tell
you
what
we
read
from
the
complaint.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
in
this
case?
