justice
scalia
i
think
justice
o'connor
is
trying
to
find
out
why.
she
knows
that
they
chose
this
instead
of
the
other.
she
is
asking
why
they
chose
this
instead
of
the
other.
is
there
some
reason?
justice
scalia
mr.
podolsky,
you
know
your
light
is
on.
justice
scalia
i
just
didn't
want
you
to
be
surprised.
justice
scalia
no,
they
wouldn't
have
made
that
claim.
i
mean,
what
maybe
rankles
with
these
people,
even
though
they
might
have
had
a
lawsuit,
they
wouldn't
have
brought
the
lawsuit
except
the
fact
that
there
were
400
places
left.
justice
scalia
how
do
we
know
when
they
decided
that
they
really
wanted
that?
let's
assume
that
i'm
one
of
the
members
of
this
class
who's
typical
of
the
whole
class,
and
i've
been
watching
this
proceeding
go
on,
and
i
see
that
race-conscious
relief
is
being
given,
but
i
say,
you
know,
well,
these
people
have
been
discriminated
against
for
years,
that's
fine,
you
know,
they're
going
to
let
them
promote
eight
even
though
i
had
a
higher
grade,
that's
okay.
but,
then,
one
day,
i
found
out
that
there
are
400
vacancies
still
left,
and,
doggone
it,
the
city
is
not
being
required
to
even
use
those
400
vacancies
to
promote
me.
it's
only
at
that
point
that
i'm
mad
enough
to
want
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
why
do
you
want
to
compel
me
to
get
in
at
the
moment
that
i
see
that
there's
any
legal
interest
of
mine
that
can
at
all
be
affected?
why
do
you
want
to
make
me
do
that
for?
to
promote
litigation
or
what?
justice
scalia
why
have
to
intervene
when
there
is
any
interest--
justice
scalia
--in
any
case,
what
is
the
test?
if
i
have
any
interest
affected
or
only
if
i
have
an
interest
affected
that
i
care
enough
about
that
i'm
willing
to
bring
a
lawsuit?
justice
scalia
you
are
just
saying
that
their
interest
is
not
a
valid
one,
but
rule
19
says
that
you
should
join
if
feasible
a
party
if
the
party
claims
an
interest
relating
to
the
subject
of
the
action.
now,
you
knew
as
soon
as
that
other
suit
was
filed
that
these
parties
claimed
an
interest.
whether
the
interest
was
valid
or
not
doesn't
make
any
difference
as
far
as
rule
19
is
concerned.
you're
just
telling
us
it
wasn't
a
valid
one.
justice
scalia
that's
because
courts
don't
write
statutes;
they
decide
controversies
between
two
people.
i
mean,
i
don't
find
that
remarkable
at
all.
if
you
want
to
bind
people
by
a
court
judgment,
you
get
those
people
between
the
court
and
adjudge
their
rights.
i
don't
know
why
you
find
that
such
a
remarkable
proposition.
justice
scalia
but
public
policy
can't
say
that
courts
are
going
to
write
statutes.
