chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
86-1415,
evelyn
marino
v.
juan
ortiz.
mr.
podolsky,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
calendar
year
1983
and
not
the
code
number
1983.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
podolsky,
where
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
rehnquist
page
3
of
that
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
then,
you
are
attacking
part
of
the
consent
decree.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
sure,
yeah.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
you
said
one
thing
to
justice
stevens
a
moment
ago
and
now
another
thing
to
justice
white.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
it
your
considered
answer
that
you
are
attacking
at
least
a
part
of
the
consent
decree?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but,
now,
mr.
podolsky,
section
1983
action
that
you've
said
you
brought,
you
chose
to
bring,
isn't
there
for
invoking
new
york's
definition
of
equal
protection
law,
it's
to
vindicate
a
federal
constitutional
claim?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
that's
fine.
but
why
the
long
discourse
about
what
new
york...
how
new
york
interprets
equal
protection
of
the
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--is
prate
v.
freedman--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
i
don't
think
we're
interested
in
distinctions
among
2nd
circuit
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
podolsky.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
nager.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nager.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
koerner.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
mr.
koerner,
you
could
get
finality
once
the
rules
are
established
just
as
surely
by
using
the
procedures
of
rule
19
as
by
using
the
rules
of
procedure
24,
couldn't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
koerner,
you've
used
the
term
"collateral
attack"
several
times.
i
suppose
all
of
these
terms
may
have
a
certain
pejorative
connotation,
but
ordinarily
collateral
attacks
suggest
that
you're
attacking
something
that
you're
a
party
to,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
case
from
this
court
most
closely
supports
that--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--i
asked
you
about
cases
from
this
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
doesn't
part
of
your
answer
depend
on
the
correctness
of
the
2nd
circuit's
rule
in
prate?
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
the
rule
you're
urging
here
be
different
if
the
2nd
circuit
had
come
out
exactly
the
opposite
in
the
prate
case?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
part
of
your
answer
is
based
on
the
correctness
of
the
2nd
circuit's
ruling.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
mr.
koerner,
you
don't
know
a
lot
of
times
during
the
course
of
litigation
that
it's
going
to
end
up
in
a
consent
decree,
do
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
what
judgments
do
you
make
before
you
know
how
the
suit
is
finally
going
to
be
disposed
of?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
does
this
mean
that
their
lawsuit
must
have
been
filed
after
the
consent
decree?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no.
what
if
a
person
half-way
through
litigation
like
this
files
an
independent
1983
action
and
you
object
to
it,
you
say
he
ought
to
have
intervened,
and
he
says
i
have
no
idea
whether
there's
going
to
be
a
consent
decree
or
not
in
the
main
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
doesn't
interrupt
the
consent
decree
judgment,
but
the
consent
decree
doesn't
bind
people
who
are
not
parties
to
the
suit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
koerner.
mr.
podolsky,
how
much
time...
does
he
have
any
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
no.
i'll
take
your
word
on
that.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no.
86-1415,
marino
versus
ortiz,
the
two
consolidated
cases.
as
to
the
issue
raised
in
marino
namely
whether
a
district
court
may
dismissed
as
an
impermissible
collateral
attack,
a
lawsuit
challenging
a
consent
decree
by
non
parties
to
the
underlying
litigation,
we
are
equally
divided,
and
therefore
affirmed
the
judgment
below
on
that
basis.
as
to
the
issue
raised
in
costello,
we
unanimously
affirmed
because
petitioners
were
not
parties
to
the
underlying
lawsuit
and
because
the
failed
to
intervene
for
purposes
of
appeal,
they
may
not
appeal
from
the
consent
decree
approving
that
lawsuit
settlement.
