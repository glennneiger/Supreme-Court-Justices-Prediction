well,
mr.
nager,
assuming
not
this
case,
but
in
an
ordinary
case
and
i'm
not
worried
about
lawyers,
they
have
lawyers,
the
parties
have
met
and
they
decide
to
ride
along
on
a
class
case
and
ride
along
until
something
happens,
and
the
consent
decree
comes
on
board,
do
you
take
the
position
that
they
could
intervene
at
that
stage?
justice
marshall
but
rather
than
start
a
new
lawsuit
so
they
could
consider
more
problems.
justice
marshall
do
you
think
that's
what
congress
meant?
justice
marshall
do
you
think
that's
what
congress
meant?
justice
marshall
i
didn't
say
allow.
i
said
meant.
justice
marshall
i
didn't
say
allow.
i
said
meant.
did
they
mean
to
give
you--
justice
marshall
--two
bites
at
the
cherry?
justice
marshall
wouldn't
that
have
been
accomplished
by
intervening?
justice
marshall
wouldn't
they
have
gotten
everything
by
intervening
that
you
would
get
by
filing
a
separate
lawsuit?
justice
marshall
then
why
file
a
separate
lawsuit?
justice
marshall
are
we
supposed
to
give
assistance
to
anybody
for
anything
they
might
believe
might
possibly
happen
under
any
circumstance
in
the
future?
justice
marshall
i
think
one
suit
is
more
economical
than
two.
am
i
wrong?
justice
marshall
what
do
you
think
the
answer
would
be
if
you
asked
me
would
i
rather
try
one
suit
or
two?
justice
marshall
i
thought
you'd
say
that.
mr.
nager,
is
your
response
about
when
these
people
should
have
known
that
they
should
get
in
accurate?
as
i
understand
the
claim,
it's
not
that...
what
they're
complaining
about
is
not
simply
that
other
people
were
promoted
in
preference
to
them
on
a
racial
basis,
but
it's
rather
that
even
allowing
that,
there
are
spaces
still
left
and
you
didn't
have
to
impose
this
degree
of
racial
discrimination.
that's
what
the
claim
asserted
here
is.
now,
when
did
they
know
that
there
were
going
to
be
400
places
left
after
imposition
of
the
race-conscious
remedy?
