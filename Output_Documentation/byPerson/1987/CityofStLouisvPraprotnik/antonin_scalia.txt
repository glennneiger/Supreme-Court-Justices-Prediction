justice
scalia
mr.
wilson,
if
your
view
is
correct,
why
wouldn't
it
be
in
the
interest
of
every
municipality
to
confer
all
policy
making
authority
for
everything
upon
one
individual,
say,
the
mayor.
and
he
can't
possibly
execute
it
all,
certainly.
so,
de
facto,
a
lot
of
people
beneath
the
mayor
are
really
making
policy;
but
he
doesn't
know
what
those
policies
are
in
fact.
he
just
doesn't
have
the
time
to
set
them
all.
so,
then
there
would
be
no
municipal
policy
on
any
of
these
things
established
by
the
only
person
authorized
by
law
to
establish
them
and
there
would
never
be
any
1983
liability.
isn't
that
what
everybody
ought
to
do?
justice
scalia
well,
then
it
is
not
a
question
of
law,
exclusively,
as
you
told
us
earlier?
justice
scalia
i
see.
and
you
would
not
have
to
trace
that
custom
or
usage
to
the
knowledge
of
the
policy
making
official?
liability
would
exist
whether
or
not
the
policy
making
official
knew
of
the
custom
or
use?
justice
scalia
what
if
what
is
open
and
notorious
is
not
the
particular
policy
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
delegee,
the
de
facto
delegee?
but
what
is
open
and
notorious
is
merely
the
fact
of
delegation.
merely
the
fact
that
the
civil
service
commission
is
not
making
the
policies,
that
it
is
allowing
people
out
there
to
establish
their
own
policies.
what
if
that
is
open
and
notorious?
not
the
nature
of
each
policy,
but
just
the
fact
that
the
mayor
or
the
civil
service
commission
is
not
running
the
show.
justice
scalia
in
the
delegation.
in
the
mere
delegation,
not
in
the
particular
policies
adopted.
justice
scalia
so
the
mayor
can
leave
it
to
somebody
and
so
long
as
that
person
does
not
act
consistently
enough
to
establish
a
policy
that
becomes
open
and
notorious,
there
can
be
no
municipal
liability.
is
that
an
accurate
statement?
justice
scalia
what
if
the
mayor
called
people
in
and
he
said,
"our
policy
is
to
get
praprotnik.
"
why
isn't
that
a
policy?
justice
scalia
but
if
a
lower
official
says,
"our
policy
is
to
get
praprotnik.
"
and
that
policy
becomes
notorious,
at
that
level,
it
is
only
a
single
incident?
justice
scalia
is
that
the
practice
against
praprotnik
or
not?
justice
scalia
i
thought
so.
justice
scalia
the
right
to
make
transfers
is
what
you
say
they
delegated
is
not
necessarily
the
right
to
establish
policy
for
transfers.
where
do
you
assert
that
that
resided?
justice
scalia
i
am
not
saying
in
this
case.
i
am
saying
as
a
matter
of
law,
where
do
you
think
the
power
to
establish
policy
for
transfers
resided
within
the
city?
justice
scalia
but
you
don't
give
any
other
instances
where
any
of
these
things
was
done
to
anyone
else.
so,
if
there
is
a
policy
that,
as
opposed
to
a
single
incident
that
you
are
complaining
about,
it
really
is
a
"get
praprotnik
policy".
is
that
the
policy
you
are
complaining
about
here?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
that
meets
the...
do
you
think
that's
what
a
policy
means
in
our
decisions?
that
if
you
go
out
after
an
individual
several
times
or
in
several
ways,
even
though
the
ways
you
go
after
him
are
contrary
to
established
principles
laid
down
by
the
municipality,
you
have
established
a
policy
of
getting
that
individual.
do
you
think
that's
within
the
fair
meaning
of
our
earlier
case?
