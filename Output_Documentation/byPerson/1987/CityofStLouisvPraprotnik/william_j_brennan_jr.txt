justice
jr.
mr.
wilson,
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
i
gather
that
the
only
argument
that
there
is
a
policy
maker
here
is
that
it
is
hamsher?
justice
jr.
does
the
respondent
argue
differently?
does
respondent
identify
anyone
else
as
a
policy
maker
except
hamsher?
justice
jr.
the
eighth
circuit
exonerated
the
other
two;
did
it
not?
justice
jr.
or
did
the
jury
do
it?
