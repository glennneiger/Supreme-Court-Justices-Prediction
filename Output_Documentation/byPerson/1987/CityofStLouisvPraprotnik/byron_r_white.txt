justice
white
well,
what
does
respondent
argue
here?
justice
white
just
defends
the
eighth
circuit
decision?
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
and
that
that
act
represented
city
policy?
justice
white
who
was
the
policy
maker
in
your
view
in
this
case?
the
commission?
justice
white
they
set
the
rules
of
the
game
about
hiring
and
firing
and
transferring?
justice
white
and
people
like
hamsher
are
just...
are
supposed
to
take
acts
consistent
with
that
policy?
justice
white
where
is
that?
justice
white
suppose
that
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
the
charter
or
the
city
council
or
whoever
actually
delegated
to
hamsher
the
policy
making
authority
to
set
the
rules
of
the
game.
and
he
just
happened
in
a
particular
case
to
make
a
retaliatory
discharge,
quite
contrary
to
his
own
policy.
would
there
be
municipal
liability
then?
justice
white
well,
certainly,
he
didn't...
certainly,
he
didn't
publish
a
policy
of
discriminatory
discharges.
justice
white
but
he
did
make
a
discriminatory
discharge
and
he
was
the
policy
maker.
is
there
municipal
liability
there?
justice
white
you
are
just
not
accepting
my
hypothesis,
but
that's
all
right.
justice
white
go
ahead.
justice
white
even
though
it
is
hard
to
say
that
the
firing
of
somebody
for
the
exercise
of
constitutional
rights
is
a
policy;
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
that
we
should
consider
this
case
only
against
the
background
of
the
transcript?
justice
white
yes,
i
know,
but
not
in
light
of
any
kind
of
a
discharge?
justice
white
how
do
we
know
it
was
a
constructive
discharge?
justice
white
but
that
wasn't
how
the
jury
had
been
instructed.
so,
it
didn't
have
that
theory
in
front
of
it.
justice
white
i
take
it
that
you
don't...
let's
assume
that
it
is
perfectly
clear
the
commission
makes
transfer
policy
and
suppose
the
transfer
policy
says,
"never
transfer
for
retaliatory
reasons.
"
"never.
"
and
some...
mr.
herschler
or
whatever...
is
herschler,
is
that
his
name?
justice
white
hamsher,
all
right.
hamsher
nevertheless
makes
a
retaliatory
transfer,
is
the
city
liable?
you
don't
urge
that
the
city
would
be
liable
in
that
case?
justice
white
well,
if
he
acts
quite
contrary
to
an
expressed
policy,
how
can
the
city
be
liable
in
that
case?
justice
white
just
take
my
example.
justice
white
do
you
think
that
the
city
is
liable
in
that?
justice
white
well,
let's
just
say
it
was
made
solely
by
that
subordinate
officer
supposedly
carrying
out
a
policy,
but
he
disobeys
it.
justice
white
well,
i
take
it,
then,
that
you
don't
really
defend
the
court
of
appeals
rationale
of
this
final
authority
business?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
suppose
if
we
think...
if
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
proceeded
on
the
wrong
legal
basis
in
doing
what
it
did,
shouldn't
it
have
a
chance
to
redo
its
appellate
job
based
on
the
right
rule
of
law?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
let
me
just
ask
you
if
you
agree
that
this
is
a
single
incident
case?
justice
white
why
not?
