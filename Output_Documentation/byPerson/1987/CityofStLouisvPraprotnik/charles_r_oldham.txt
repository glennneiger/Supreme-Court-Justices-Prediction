mr.
charles
r.
oldham
if
the
court
please,
mr.
chief
justice:
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
our
version
of
the
facts
and
the
version
of
the
facts
as
presented
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
was
a
jury
tried
case.
and
respondent
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
all
evidence
in
his
favor
and
all
reasonable
inference
drawn
therefrom.
now,
there
are
certain
facts
that
are
not
in
dispute.
it
is
stipulated
that
the
acts
against
praprotnik
were
done
under
color
of
law.
it
was
stipulated
that
he
was
engaged
in
protected
activity
at
the
time
he
appealed
his
actions
to
the
civil
service
commission.
and
there
was
evidence
that
he
was
also
engaged
in
protected
activity
when
he
made
some
criticism
of
seraph
sculpture.
a
jury
clearly
found
that
praprotnik
had
been
subjected
to
retaliation
because
of
his
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
now,
i
want
to
get
briefly
into
the
facts
where
we
are
in
difference.
for
example,
petitioner
argues
that
hamsher
was
solely
responsible
for
the
transfer
of
praprotnik
from
a
secure
position
in
the
cda
to
an
insecure
position
at
heritage
and
urban
design.
now,
let
me
explain
that
situation.
praprotnik
had
seniority
position
where
he
was
the
top
seniority
person.
he
had
about
19
or
20
years
of
service
at
cda.
there
were
three
or
four
people
in
his
same
position
underneath
him.
so
that
in
order
to
reach
praprotnik,
they
would
have
had
to
lay
off
everybody
underneath
him
in
the
same
classification.
he
was
moved
from
that
position
to
a
position
at
heritage
and
urban
design
where
he
was
the
only
person
in
that
classification.
since
we
have
departmental
lay
off,
he
was
subject
to
immediate
lay
off.
now,
in
regard
to
the
transfer,
there
are
a
few
facts
that
led
up
to
the
transfer.
there
had
been
the
situation
with
the
civil
service
commission.
there
had
been
acts
of
retaliation
against
mr.
praprotnik
in
terms
of
taking
away
his
personnel,
reducing
his
scope
of
his
responsibilities.
things
of
this
nature.
after
that,
he
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
the
heritage
and
urban
design
commission
to
testify
concerning
the
piece
of
sculpture,
the
seraph
sculpture
which
was
ensconced
on
the
front
yard
of
the
civil
courts
building
in
the
city
of
st.
louis.
he
testified
and
his
testimony
was
not
well
received
by
the
mayor.
and
he
was
immediately
called
into
mr.
hamsher's
office
and
told
that
he
should
have
mucked
it,
that
he
shouldn't
have
given
this
particular
information
to
the
heritage
and
urban
design
commission.
now,
that
was
in
the
fall.
the
following
spring,
he
was
transferred.
now,
the
act
of
transfer,
in
his
particular
situation,
involved
not
only
the
transfer
of
the
individual,
but
the
transfer
of
functions.
in
order
to
transfer
functions,
they
had
to
get
the
approval
of
the
board
of
estimate
and
apportionment,
which
consisted
of
the
mayor,
the
president
of
the
board
of
aldermen
and
the
comptroller,
the
three
highest
elected
officials
of
the
city.
they
had
to
approve
the
transfer
of
functions.
now,
the
testimony
is--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
they
had
to
approve
the
change
of
the
budget
and
the
change
of
the
functions
so
that
they
could
be
assigned
over
here.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
that's
part
of
the
evidence.
the
other
evidence
is
that
mr.
hamsher
testified
in
his
testimony
that
he
went
in
and
discussed
this
matter
with
the
mayor
and
he
recommended
the
transfer
of
mr.
praprotnik
and
that
the
mayor
made
the
decision
to
transfer
mr.
praprotnik
and
that
he,
as
a
good
loyal
servant
of
the
mayor,
followed
his
actions.
that
is
in
our
brief.
it
is
in
the
transcript.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
there
was
a
mr.
conway
who
was...
preceded
a
mr.
famel.
and
mr.
spaid
was
the
cda
director
who
originally
took
the
action
against
praprotnik
and
suspended
him
and
later
reduced
him,
responsibilities.
then,
when
mr.
hamsher
came
in,
there
was
the
situation
with
the
seraph
sculpture,
there
was
a
further
reduction
of
responsibilities
and
after
that
the
transfer
of
mr.
praprotnik
over
to
the
heritage
and
urban
design
commission.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
under
1983?
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
only
on
what
we
would
consider
appropriate
circumstances
where
the
higher
officials
or
the
policy
making
body
was
aware
of
what
happened
or
had
constructive
notice
of
what
happened
and
permitted
it
to
go
on.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
that
is
correct.
let
me
explain
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
all
right.
in
this
situation,
which
involved
the
transfer,
the
right
to
make
transfers
was
delegated
by
the
civil
service
commission
to
mr.
hamsher,
the
director
of
personnel,
mr.
duffe
and
the
receiving
official,
mr.
jackson.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
for
certain
services
it
is
a
policy
making
body
and
for
certain
other
purposes,
it
is
not.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
all
right.
the
policy
for
transfers
was
established
in
this
case
by
the
action
of
the
mayor,
the
board
of
ena
and
with
the
knowledge
of
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
every
city
has
a
different
situation.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
in
a
given
situation
and
say,
"under
these
facts,
this
individual
may
have
policy
making
authority.
"
"under
these
facts,
another
individual
might
have
policy
making
authority.
"
that
is
why
we
say
that
it
is
a
factual
situation,
which
is
a
question
of
fact
to
the
jury.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
i
think
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
law,
in
fact,
like
many
things.
but
i
think
the
jury
in
this
case
was
instructed
and
given
the
instructions
to
determine
who
was
the
policy
maker
and
whether
or
not
these
high
officials
represented
the
actions
of
the
city.
they
were
also
told
that
the
city
can
only
be
liable
if
it
was
part
of
a
policy
that
was
knowingly
followed
by
the
city
so
that
this
was
what
was
submitted
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
and
the
jury
then
found
the
city
responsible.
and,
based
upon
that,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
act
of
a
transfer
in
this
particular
situation
was
a
policy
action.
now,
let
me
explain
that
a
little
further.
the
decision
of
hamsher,
jackson,
duffe,
who
was
director
of
personnel,
and
the
mayor
and
the
other
two
individuals
i
mentioned,
comptroller
and
president
of
the
board
of
aldermen,
to
transfer
mr.
praprotnik
was
not
subject
to
review.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
yes,
the
same
mayor
was
involved...
in
the
first
instance,
the
first
suspension
was
done
by
mr.
spaid
who
was
then
director
of
cda
under
a
different
mayor.
but
mr.
shamo
was
the
mayor
during
most
of
this
process.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
well,
that
is
what
happened.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
i
don't
agree
with
some
of
the
parts
of
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit.
for
example,
i
don't
necessarily
agree
that
our
case
was
predicated
upon
a
final
authority
situation.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
yes.
i
agree
that
that
was
a
constructive
discharge.
the
duties
and
responsibilities
that
praprotnik
were
given
were
so
menial
for
a
person
in
his
category
as
a
licensed
architect,
to
reduce
him
to
filing
maps
and
things
of
this
nature,
constituted
a
constructive
discharge.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
no.
they
were
asked
if
he
were...
the
instructions
were
give
on
which
there
were
no
objections
made
that
you
could
find
the
city
liable
if
this
was
done
by
high
officials.
it
is
not
limited
to
the
three
officials
that
were
named
in
the
law
suit.
you
have
to
remember
that
this
was
a
long
time
process
and
that
in
august
prior
to
the
trial,
i
attempted
to
amend
the
petition
to
bring
in
some
additional
named
defendants,
specifically,
the
mayor,
mr.
nash,
who
was
the
director
of
the
department
of
public
welfare
and
others.
and
that
petition
was
denied.
so,
we
were
left
in
the
posture
where
we
were
not
able
to
get
all
the
named
defendants
who
had
taken
part
in
this
particular
action
in
that
particular
law
suit.
and
we
were
left
with
the
city
as
a
defendant.
now,
both
myself
and
the
attorney
for
the
city
pointed
out
to
the
jury
that
there
were
other
high
officials
involved
in
this
action.
and
that
these
other
high
officials,
and
our
contention
was
that
these
other
high
officials
did
it,
then
the
city
was
liable
even
if
they
should
find
that
the
three
individuals
were
not
responsible.
so
that
that's
a
posture
that
we
found
ourselves
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
yes.
when
you
have
high
officials
of
the
government
involved
in
this
process
and
you
have
a
civil
service
commission
in
the
position
where
they
know
about
it
because
they
have
an
appeal
pending
before
them
which
they
have
declined
to
hear.
and
they
take
no
action
on
it.
they
say,
"we
will
not
hear
transfer
appeals.
"
then
when
we
have
the
lay-off,
we
also
filed
that
appeal.
and
that
appeal
is
still
pending
some
three
or
four
years
later.
we
don't
think
this
is
an
effective
review.
they
have
permitted
this
process
to
go
on.
and,
so,
they
have
had
knowledge
of
this
all
during
the
time.
and
it
is
not
a
question
of
constructive
knowledge,
but
actual
knowledge
of
what
occurred.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
i
think
that
you...
if
you
have
a
policy
maker
who
makes
a
decision
to
violate
somebody's
constitutional
rights--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--single
decision.
you
have
a
policy
maker
who
makes
a
single
decision
to
violate
somebody's
constitutional
rights
and
there
is
no
effective
appeal
process
within
the
city,
itself,
then
i
think
that
that
is
a
policy
decision
that
has
been
made
by
the
city.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
as
i
understand
monell,
it
also
said
that
when
a
high
public
official
or
policy
maker
speaks
on
behalf
of
the
city
that
that
can
create
liability.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
well,
i
think
that
one
instance
is...
and,
actually,
one
instance
can
in
appropriate
circumstances
create
the
policy
which
raises
the
issue
of
liability.
i
think
that
there
are
times
when
that
occurs.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
justice
rehnquist,
i
differentiate
that
because
i
talk
about
a
policy
maker
having
that
right.
a
high
public
official.
for
example,
it
is
agreed
that
if
the
school
board
of
the
city
of
st.
louis
fires
somebody
because
of
their
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right,
that
would
create
liability
under
1983.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
well,
i
think
the
courts
have
held
that
there
is
liability
under
1983.
and
i
equate
that
with
the
same
type
of
situation,
your
honor.
in
this
situation,
we
get
back
to
the
basic
fact
that
this
was
a
jury
tried
case
that
the
jury
found
there
was
retaliation,
the
jury
found
liability
on
the
part
of
the
city.
and
one
of
the
points
that
the
city
has
talked
about
in
its
brief
and
presented
in
its
argument
is
that
there
is
a
basic
inconsistency
about
the
verdict
which
exonerates
the
three
individuals
and
the
verdict
which
finds
the
city
liable.
and
that
is
not
the
posture
of
the
case
because
the
instructions
permitted
you
go
beyond
the
three
individuals.
the
arguments
of
counsel
for
the
city
pointed
out
that
these
three
individuals
weren't
responsible,
that
there
were
other
high
public
officials
that
were
responsible.
and
i
pointed
out
that
there
were
other
high
officials
that
were
responsible
so
that
the
jury
could,
under
the
arguments
and
under
the
instructions,
find
liability
by
the
city
and
excuse
the
three
individuals.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
no,
not
in
this
case.
we
asked
for
a--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--this
is
the
one
the
commission
refused
to
hear
until
the
matter
had
been
resolved
by
the
courts.
we
filed
an
appeal--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--oh,
we
were
already
in
court
on
the
transfer.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
well,
we
were
already
in
court
on
the
transfer
situation.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
we
had
filed
a
complaint
in
federal
court.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
under
section
1983
alleging
the
transfer
was
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
and
then
after...
they
went
ahead
and
did
the
lay-off.
we
then
filed
another
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
and
they
refused
to
hear
that.
they
placed
it
on
the
back
burner
where
it
has
been
all
this
time
so
that
we
have
not
had
an
effective
appeal
process.
there
is
another
thing
that
the
court
must
bear
in
mind.
on
a
lay-off,
the
civil
service
commission
does
not
give
you
a
full
due
process
hearing.
they
limit
the
type
of
hearing
that
you
can
have.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
well,
i
was
responding
to
a
question
by
justice
o'connor.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
there
was
a
constructive
discharge
in
this
case
by...
that
resulted
from
the
transfer,
yes,
your
honor.
and
then
ultimately
the
lay-off.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
you
know,
in
reviewing
the
evidence
felt
that
this
was
constructive
discharge.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
the
jury
was
instructed
on
the
transfer
and
the
lay-off.
the
jury
was
instructed
on
the
transfer
and
the
lay-off
so
that
both
of
those
were
involved
in
the
jury
instruction.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
hamsher.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
not
in
every
instance,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
well,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
1983
you
had
a
situation
in
the
south
where--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--okay.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
there
are
situations
where
the
city
would
be
liable.
and
those
situations
are
where
the
decision
was
not
made
just
by
the
low-level
individual
but
where
other
people
had
knowledge
of
it.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
in
a
situation
like
that,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
liability
on
the
part
of
the
city
under
1983.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
that
is
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
your
honor,
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
little
bit
more
than
the
final
authority
process.
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
action
taken
by
high
public
officials.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
and
that
is
the
theory
upon
which
this
case
was
tried.
and
that
was
the
theory
that
was
presented
to
the
jury.
and
that
was
the
theory
that
was
presented
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury
so
that
we
have
to
look
at
this
case
in
the
posture
in
which
it
was
tried
before
the
jury.
and
those
instructions...
well,
they
might
have
been
improved
upon--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--well,
your
honor,
of
course
that
is
one
of
the
options
available
to
the
court.
but
i
think
the
court
can
also
look
at
the
basic
case
and
say
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
right,
but
some
of
their
reasoning
was
not
correct
and
you
could
give
the
correct
reasoning
and
go
ahead
and
affirm
the
judgment
that
we
received.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
i
think
that
is
entirely
possible.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
i
do
not.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
well,
because
actions
against
praprotnik
covered
a
period
of
almost
three
years.
and
it
covered
a
number
of
incidents.
they
involved,
first
of
all,
he
was
supposed
to
get
a
reprimand
saying
that
he
had
not
obtained
a
clear
understanding
of
the
policy
established
by
mr.
spaid.
instead,
they
reprimanded
him
for
what
he
had
originally
been
charged
with
before
the
civil
service
commission
and
placed
it
in
his
personnel
file.
and
even
mr.
kindleberger,
the
person
who
did
it,
admitted
that
he
was
in
error
on
that
or
didn't
do
it
right.
there
were
other
things
that
happened.
mr.
spaid
called
him
in
and
they
reduced
his
pay
a
couple
of
pay
steps
right
after
they
had
recommended
him
for
a
two-step
increase.
and
this
happened
right
after
the
civil
service
hearing.
after
that,
his
responsibilities
were
reduced.
when
mr.
hamsher
came
in,
they
had
the
incident
with
the
seraph
sculpture
and
after
that
things
went
really
downhill
and
he
was
reduced
further
in
responsibilities.
much
of
his
work
was
taken
away
from
him.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
that
is
about
what
happened,
judge,
because
i
remember
there
was
a--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--i
think
that
is
within
the
meaning
of
1983.
if
you
have
a
single
isolated
incident,
that
is
one
thing.
that
is
something
that
happens
within
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
to
one
individual.
but
when
you
have
a
number
of
incidents
and
it
is
clear
over
a
period
of
three
years
directed
at
that
individual,
i
think
you
have
a
"get
praprotnik"
policy.
and
i
remember
that
the
case
of
parlow
v.
fitzgerald
where
there
was
a
"get
fitzgerald"
policy
and
it
is
somewhat
similar.
because
praprotnik
was
as
well
known
within
the
st.
louis
hierarchy
as
fitzgerald
was
within
the
federal
government
hierarchy.
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that
a
person...
that
if
a
policy
making
people
and
people
who
are
in
a
position
to
make
decisions
that
effect
an
individual
and
do
so
for
unconstitutional
reasons,
that
that
doesn't
create
the
city's...
liability
on
the
part
of
the
city.
because,
remember,
in
our
instructions
to
the
jury,
we
said
that
the
high
officials
had
to
have
the
authority
to
speak
for
the
city
and
it
could
only
be...
the
city
could
only
be
held
responsible
where
they
did
it
knowingly
and
with
knowledge.
and
so
that
is
the
posture
of
this
particular
case--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
but
there
were
a
number
of
incidents
involving
that
single--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--one
man.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
that
is
difficult
to
say
because--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--in
terms
of
direct
words
to
mr.
praprotnik,
nobody
said,
"we
are
going
to
fire
you
because
of
this.
"
or,
"we
are
going
to
transfer
you
because
of
this.
"
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
because
the
mayor
made
the
decision
to
transfer
mr.
praprotnik
and
made
decisions
to
transfer
the
function,
which,
incidentally,
were
never
transferred.
in
order
to
be
legal,
under
its
charter,
they
had
to
transfer
the
functions
over
to
the
division
of
heritage
and
urban
design.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
no
record
of
any
transfer
of
functions
over
to
the
heritage
and
urban
design
so
that
it
indicates
that
even
though
there
was
a
decision
made--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--pardon?
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
the
record
reflects
that--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--oh,
no.
the
record
reflects
that
he
did
know
about
the
man.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
the
record
reflects
that
the
mayor
made
the
decision
to
transfer
him.
the
record
reflects
that
the
mayor
made
the
decision
to
transfer
his
functions.
the
record
reflects
that
the
mayor
was
involved
in
being
unhappy
about
his
testimony
about
the
seraph
sculpture.
in
order
for
the
court
to
understand
that,
the
seraph
sculpture
was
being
promoted
by
emily
pulitzer,
who
is
the
wife
of
joe
pulitzer,
who
owns
the
post
dispatch,
whose
position
is
important
to
the
mayor.
and
they
had
proposed
a
seraph
sculpture
to
be
put
out
in
the
front
yard
of
the
courthouse.
and
when
he
testified
that
there
were
some
problems
with
the
seraph
sculpture,
under
oath,
before
the
heritage
and
urban
design
commission,
he
was
called
in
and
reprimanded
by
mr.
hamsher
and
was
told
that
he
should
have
mucked
the
questions,
that
he
should
not
have
responded
to
them,
that
the
mayor
was
unhappy.
so
that
the
mayor
was
involved
in
this
situation
and
knew
about
it.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
mr.
hamsher--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--an
agent
of
the
mayor
told
mr.
praprotnik...
his
supervisor
told
mr.
praprotnik--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--other
than
statements
of
his
agents?
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
a
statement
of
an
employee
or
agent
of
the
mayor
is
hearsay.
i
think
that
is...
when
you
speak
for
your
principal,
that
takes
it
beyond
the
hearsay
stage.
and,
so,
we
have
statements
by
the
employees,
agents
of
the
mayor,
saying
the
mayor
was
unhappy.
and
i
do
not
think
that
is
hearsay.
if
the
court
please,
i
know
my
time
is
about
up:
i
think
that
our
case
should
be
affirmed
for
the
reasons
we
have
stated.
that
high
public
officials
were
involved,
that
the
jury
verdict
under
the
seventh
amendment
should
be
respected
and
that
the
court
should
grant
the
relief
we
have
requested.
