justice

mr.
wilson,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
get
into
the
more
details?
justice
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
the
question
whether
a
particular
agent
of
the
city
is
a
policy
making
official
is
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
law?
justice
stevens
so,
then
it
doesn't...
and
you
point
is
that
regardless
of
what
the
evidence
was,
since
he
didn't...
i
mean
it
was
with
regard
to
a
particular
transaction,
he
could
not
qualify?
justice
stevens
and
the
judge
shouldn't
have
even
given
the
jury
the
instruction,
"if
you
find
him
to
be
a
policy
making
official.
"
that
was
error,
too?
justice
stevens
mr.
wilson,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
think
it
is
rather
important
to
your
position
that
it
be
treated
a
single
incident
case,
because
otherwise
you
might
have
multiple
incidents
which
amount
to
a
custom.
justice
stevens
could
it
get
away
from
the
single
incident
posture
if
several
times
this
sort
of
thing
happened
to
the
same
individual
or
would
that
still
be
a
single
incident
as
long
as
it
is
one
individual?
justice
stevens
if
there
was
several
retaliatory
adverse
actions
against
this
individual,
you
would
say
that
could
amount
to
policy?
justice
stevens
are
you
saying
that
still
is
a
single
incident
if
the
same
thing
happened
to
employee
x
six
or
seven
times
that
he
was
constantly
treated
in
this
same
way.
that
would
be
a
single
incident
or
would
that
amount
to
a
custom.
that
is
what
i
am
not
clear
on
at
all.
justice
stevens
what
is
the
difference
between
six
adverse
actions
for
mr.
smith
and
one
adverse
action
for
mr.
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e?
justice
stevens
no,
but
i
am
assuming
three
police
chases
of
the
same
individual.
wouldn't
that
be
the
same,
just
as
much
a
custom
as
chasing
three
different
individuals?
justice
stevens
no
matter
how
often
you
repeated
it?
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
wilson,
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
relying
on
your
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
at
the
close
of
his
case.
justice
stevens
which,
it
seems
to
me,
allows
your
opponent
to
rely
on
evidence
in
the
record,
even
though
it
might
not
have
been
referred
to
in
the
instructions?
justice
stevens
no,
but
at
the
directed
verdict
stage,
you
are
not
really
debating
the
theory
of
the
case
of
whether
there
is
any
evidence
that
would
sustain
liability
under
1983.
