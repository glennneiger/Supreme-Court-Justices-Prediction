mr.
james
j.
wilson
thank
you.
this
proceeding,
brought
under
section
1983,
involves
the
imposition
of
municipal
liability
upon
the
petitioner
for
the
single
isolated
act
of
a
city
official
who
lacked
general
authority
in
the
area
and
whose
action
was
contrary
to
the
policy
of
the
city.
this
is
a
monell
type
case.
in
monell,
this
court
indicated
that
it
was
going
to
leave
to
future
decisions
the
full
contours
of
municipal
liability.
it
is
our
position
in
respect
to
single
incidents
that
this
court
has
shaped
those
contours
in
its
decisions
in
cases
such
as
owens,
tuttle,
and
particularly
the
recent
pembaur
decision.
and
what
this
proceeding
calls
for
is
an
application
of
those
principles
to
the
facts
herein.
the
facts
are
largely
undisputed.
the
plaintiff
was
a
civil
service
employee
of
the
city
of
st.
louis.
he
was
a
planner
for
our
community
development
commission.
around
1980,
he
became
embroiled
in
a
dispute
with
his
supervisor.
this
led
to
a
15-day
suspension
for
violation
of
the
secondary
employment
rule.
he
appealed
to
our
civil
service
commission
which
reduced
that
to
a
reprimand.
in
april
1981,
because
of
a
change
of
administrations,
the
new
mayor
appointed
a
defendant
frank
hamsher
as
the
head
of
the
community
development
agency.
approximately
one
year
later,
mr.
hamsher,
as
director
of
that
agency,
transferred
the
plaintiff
to
another
city
department.
he
filed
an
appeal
with
the
civil
service
commission.
the
civil
service
commission
declined
that
appeal
on
the
basis
that
no
injury
was
done
to
him
at
that
time
since
this
was
a
lateral
transfer.
subsequent
to
that,
the
plaintiff
filed
a
1983
action
naming
three
city
officials
and
the
city
as
defendants.
defendant
hamsher
was
one
of
those
named.
the
plaintiff
was
subsequently
laid
off
from
his
position
some
17
months
after
the
transfer.
he
took
an
appeal
from
that
layoff
and
that
appeal
has
been
deferred
awaiting
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding.
we
believe
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
acts
of
the
defendant
hamsher
in
transferring
the
plaintiff
fall
within
the
language
of
monell
which
imposes
liability
for
acts
which
can
be
said
to
fairly
represent
governmental
policy.
now,
the
court
below,
the
trial
court
rendered
through
a
jury
verdict
a
judgment
against
the
city
of
st.
louis.
it
exonerated
the
three
individual
defendants.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
determined
that
the
jury
had
found
that
the
act
of
transfer
was
a
retaliatory
act
on
the
part
of
defendant
hamsher
and
he
was
impermissibly
motivated
and
caused
constitutional
injury
to
the
plaintiff
who
had
been
exercising
his
right
of
first
amendment
by
appealing
to
the
civil
service
commission.
the
eighth
circuit
determined
that
the
defendant
hamsher
was
a
policy
maker
and
his
action,
therefore,
in
transferring
the
plaintiff
bound
the
city
of
st.
louis
so
that
monell
type
liability
was
imposed
upon
the
city
as
a
policy
maker.
it
is
our
position
that
the
crux
of
this
matter
involves
the
distinction
between
a
city
official
who
has
the
discretion
to
act.
in
this
case,
the
discretion
to
hire
and
fire
and
transfer
employees
as
opposed
to
the
authority
of
a
policy
maker.
in
this
case,
it
would
be
the
authority
to
set
employment
policy
for
the
city
of
st.
louis.
clearly,
the
defendant
hamsher
had
the
former:
the
discretionary
power
to
hire,
fire
and
transfer
employees.
but
nowhere
in
the
record
is
there
presented
any
evidence
that
the
defendant
hamsher
was
a
policy
maker
for
purposes
of
setting
the
employment
policy
of
the
city
of
st.
louis.
the
court
of
appeals
misconstrued
pembaur.
they
adopted
in
their
opinion
what
has
been
labeled
the
final
authority
test,
which
the
court
said
was
a
two-pronged
test
to
determine
monell
liability.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
yes.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
clearly,
a
question
of
law.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
yes,
that
would
be
correct.
the
record
does
not
support
any
imposition
of
liability
upon
the
city.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
that
is
correct.
they
should
have
never
reached
that
point.
we
do
not
believe
that
a
submissible
case
was
made
under
these
facts.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
they
were
instructed
that
high
government
officials
could
be
held
liable.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
yes.
the
instructions
were
totally
inadequate,
but
what
we
are
presenting
here
and
what
we
have
preserved
is
the
error
in
overruling
our
motions
for
directed
verdicts
which
we
made
at
each
critical
stage
in
respect
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
impose
under
any
proper
standard
liability--
mr.
james
j.
wilson
--well,
the
jury
would
have
had
to
follow
the
instructions,
i
think.
and
the
verdict
directing
instruction
only
named
the
three
defendants,
hamsher
and
two
other
supervisors.
it
did
not
name
the
mayor--
mr.
james
j.
wilson
--there
is
nothing
in...
my
interpretation
of
the
record,
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
would
support
that
inference.
there
is
some
allusions
to
the
mayor.
i
think
there
is
an
allusion
that
the
mayor
knew
that
there
was
a
transfer
of
functions
from
one
department
to
another,
but
that
was
different
than
having
knowledge
particularly
of
this
plaintiff.
so,
our
answer
would
be
no,
although
the
mayor
was
never
named
in
a
verdict
director
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
particular
instance.
we
believe
that
the
test
of
the
final...
the
final
authority
test
that
the
eighth
circuit
placed
in
its
opinion
is
erroneous.
it
is
contrary
to
pembaur.
the
delegated
authority
to
act,
i
think
may
be
categorized
as
discretion.
and
this
court
made
clear
in
pembaur
in
part
2(b)
that
discretion
is
not
enough
to
impose
liability.
if
i
may
quote:
"the
official
must
be
responsible
for
establishing
final
government
policy
respecting
such
activity.
"
aside
from
the
being
contrary
to
pembaur,
the
test
promoted
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
its
opinion
is
unreasonable.
the
question
of
delegating
out
authority
is
one
that
runs
throughout
all
of
city
officialdom
in
employment.
we
could
not
conduct
business
without
delegating
out
discretion
to
employees
all
the
way
down
the
line.
also,
the
second
part
of
the
test,
the
lack
of
de
novo
review
is
equally
unreasonable.
there
are
countless
decisions
that
are
made
everyday
operationally
that
there
is
no
apparatus
to
provide
review.
as
an
example,
the
police
officer
in
tuttle
who
was
involved
in
the
shooting.
there
would
have
been
nothing
that
would
have
provided
reasonably
any
review
for
that
act
prior
to
what
had
occurred.
we
believe
the
test
is
totally
unreasonable,
but
the
main
point
is
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
opinions...
most
of
the
opinions
that
were
rendered
in
pembaur.
the
plurality
opinion
i
think
clearly,
which
relies
upon,
as
a
basis
the
identification
of
a
policy
maker.
and
the
policy
maker
identification
is
arrived
at
by
an
inquiry
into
state
law
as
to
the
authority
of
that
official
to
set
policy.
here
i
believe
you
have
a
contrast
in
pembaur
between
the
official
who
was
held
liable
and
the
defendant
hamsher,
who
we
assert
should
not
have
been
considered
to
be
a
policy
maker.
the
prosecutor
in
pembaur
was
an
elected
county-wide
official.
the
sixth
circuit
had
held
clearly
interpreting
ohio
law
that
he
was
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
for
that
particular
county.
he
was
not
answerable
or
responsible
in
respect
to
any
of
his
conduct,
other
than
to
the
voters.
there
were
no
parameters
or
criteria
that
circumscribed
his
action.
here,
in
respect
to
hamsher,
our
purported
policy
maker,
the
record
is
very
sparse;
but
we
do
know
he
is
appointed
by
the
mayor.
he
is
a
functionary
in
respect
to
approving
development
plans
for
the
city
and
in
administering
community
development
funds.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
yes.
this
is
what
the
eighth
circuit
construed
the
jury
verdict
to
be:
that
the
defendant
hamsher
made
a
retaliatory
act
in
transferring--
mr.
james
j.
wilson
--the
respondent
did
in
their
verdict
directing
instruction,
your
honor,
two
other
supervisors.
one
who
succeeded
hamsher.
the
evidence
is
almost
non-existent
the
defendant
patterson
in
respect
to
that?
mr.
james
j.
wilson
i
believe
the
respondent--
mr.
james
j.
wilson
--no.
the
respondent
has
abandoned
the
eighth
circuit
decision
in
respect
to
the
test,
the
final
authority
test.
i
don't
believe
the
respondent
has
abandoned
the
eighth
circuit
determination
and
what
the
jury
did
was
find
that
frank
hamsher
made
an
impermissibly
motivated
unconstitutional
act
by
reason
of
retaliatory
transfer.
that
would
be
our
interpretation
of
the
respondent's
brief.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
yes.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
well,
the
jury
exonerated
all
the
individual
defendants.
and
the
eighth
circuit
focused
in
upholding
the
verdict
on
the
defendant
hamsher
that
his
single
act
of
transferring
was
a
retaliatory
act
for
filing
the
civil
service
appeal.
he
is
the
only
one
that
would
have
had
the
ability
to
have
made
the
transfer
under
our--
mr.
james
j.
wilson
--yes,
that's
right.
that
was
their
categorization
of
what
the
jury
had
determined.
i
think
the
difference
between
our
prosecutor
in
pembaur
and
the
defendant
hamsher
here
is:
hamsher's
discretion
to
hire
and
fire
was
subject
to
civil
service
rules
and
our
entire
civil
service
system.
he
was
not
unfettered
in
making
employment
decisions
in
respect
to
his
particular
employees.
i
think
there
was
a
number
of
appeals
that
the
plaintiff
made
and
that
he
received
relief
in
the
main
on
those
appeals
which
indicated
that
hamsher
was
not
in
a
position
to
set
policy
for
his
employees.
he
had
the
civil
service
commission
of
the
city
looking
over
him.
footnote
12
in
pembaur,
the
plurality
opinion,
we
believe
anticipated
exactly
the
fact
situation
we
have
there.
the
court
in
that
opinion
hypothesized
a
county
sheriff,
a
hypothetical
county
sheriff
who,
while
being
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer,
received
rules
and
regulations
in
respect
to
employment
from
the
county
board
of
commissioners.
in
that
hypothetical,
that
county
sheriff,
if
he
committed
an
unconstitutional
act
in
respect
to
his
employees,
it
would
not
impose
liability
upon
the
county;
although,
if
he
acted
in
respect
to
his
function
as
chief
law
enforcement
officer,
liability
would
be
imposed.
that
is
what
we
believe
is
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
record
in
respect
to
the
defendant
hamsher.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
yes.
we
have
a
charter
amendment
that
specifically
sets
up
a
civil
service
system
and
it
gives
our
civil
service
commission
rule
making
authority
and
they
have
been
recognized--
mr.
james
j.
wilson
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
well,
i
guess
if
i
could
explain,
justice
scalia.
i
believe
that
that
would
call
into
play
a
second
type
of
monell
liability.
and
that
is
what
we
would
find
as
custom
and
usage.
if
you
delegated
out
authority
and
with
the
passage
of
time
it
became
open
and
notorious
that
there
were
widespread
unconstitutional
practices,
then
i
think
there
attaches
liability
on
the
city
because
the
policy
maker,
the
mayor
in
your
hypothetical--
mr.
james
j.
wilson
--in
respect
i
think
to
single
incident
liability.
now,
we
are
separating
out
the
types
of
monell
liability.
i
think
there
are
three
kinds.
there
is
general
rules
of
application.
i
think
there
is
custom
and
usage.
and
then
i
think
there
is
a
third
type
of
liability
which
i
would
call
single
incident
liability.
under
pembaur,
i
think
the
threshold
question
is
who
is
a
policy
maker
and
that,
we
would
believe,
is
purely
a
question
of
law.
if
we
are
in
the
second
category,
custom
and
usage
and
practice,
then
that
would
raise
a
number
of
factual
issues
for
a
jury.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
i
think
that
is
an
open
question.
and
i
think
the
fifth
circuit,
which
rendered
an
opinion
on
this
particular
issue
felt
that
constructive
knowledge
was
enough
in
that
instance
to
impose
liability,
constructive
knowledge
on
the
part,
even
though
the
fifth
circuit
is
clearly
in
conflict
with
our
present
decision
from
the
eighth
circuit
because
they
abandoned
what
we
categorize
as
the
final
authority
test.
i
think
the
key
here
is,
unlike
the
prosecutor
in
pembaur,
hamsher
had
substantive
constraints
upon
the
scope
of
his
employment
decisions.
the
dissent
in
the
eighth
circuit
i
think
captured
the
significance
of
these
restraints
in
our
appendix
to
our
petition.
the
judge
stated,
judge
ross
stated
the
civil
service
rules
permit
appointing
authorities
discretion
in
making
personnel
decisions,
but
do
not
grant
them
the
power
to
set
personnel
policy.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
that's
in
our
brief,
in
our
petition
at
a-22.
judge
ross'
dissent,
which
i
might
add
cited
the
footnote
12
from
pembaur
and
set
the
footnote
out
verbatim
indicating
his
belief
that
it
is
squarely
on
the
facts
in
the
present
record.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
contrary
to
his
own?
mr.
james
j.
wilson
no,
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
under
that
hypothetical,
we
would
say,
no.
hamsher
would
still
be
circumscribed
in
the
city
of
st.
louis
by
the
civil
service
commission
rules.
he
would
not
be
a
policy
maker
because
i
think
there
is
other
indicia--
mr.
james
j.
wilson
--if
i
may,
justice
white?
mr.
james
j.
wilson
if
there
was
a
delegation
of
authority,
if
it
was
a
lawful
delegation,
i
think
you
are
going
to
have
difficulty
finding
lawful
delegations
of
authority.
but,
assuming
there
was
lawful
delegation
from
the
policy
maker
to
another
city
official,
then
that
city
official
would
take
on
the
responsibilities
of
a
policy
maker
under
monell.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
i
think
in
respect
to
single
incidents,
we
would
say,
no,
unless
the
civil
service
commission
in
this
instance
would
have
had
actual
knowledge
that
the
transfer
was
impermissibly
motivated.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
we
would
say
that
there
would
be...
clearly,
no
liability
in
that
particular
case.
now,
if
you
get
into
a
widespread
practice
over
a
passage
of
time
that
is
open
and
notorious,
there
we
have
the
question
that
i
think
i
attempted
to
answer
with
judge
scalia,
their
constructive
knowledge
could
operate
to
impose
municipal
liability,
but
not
in
respect
to
a
single
incident,
unless
the
policy
maker--
mr.
james
j.
wilson
--if,
again,
we're
in
the
second
category,
custom
and
practice,
liability
can
occur
where
there
is
acquiescence
by
the
policy
maker.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
in
the
mere
delegation?
no.
we
would
say
not.
we
would
say,
again,
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
state
law.
if
there
is
an
unlawful
delegation,
that
would
not
satisfy
what
we
understand
the
test
of
pembaur,
the
plurality,
to
indicate.
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
authority
that
has
been
granted
by
state
statute
or
city
charter
or
ordinance.
if
there
were
an
unlawful
delegation,
that
would
not
transfer
on
to
the
delegee
the
ability
to
impose
municipal
liability.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
that
is
our
position,
yes.
the
concurring
opinions
in
pembaur
by
justice
white
and
joined
in
by
justice
o'connor
indicate
and
they
are
at
variance
with
the
plurality,
although
i
think
if
applied
here
would
reach
the
same
result,
which
would
be
reversal,
would
indicate
that
where
the
law
has
placed
limits
on
the
city
official
and
he
acts
contrary
to
and
outside
those
limits,
that
his
acts
cannot
be
considered
to
be
policies
of
the
governmental
entity.
applied
here,
clearly
there
was
criteria
through
our
civil
service
system
and
parameters
on
the
defendant
hamsher.
the
civil
service
system
has
specifically
provided
in
its
charter
amendment
that
the
system
is
to
be
run
on
merit
and
fitness
based
upon
service
ratings.
there
is
a
right
of
appeal
that
has
been
specifically
granted.
i
think
that
right
of
appeal
in
a
civil
service
system
carries
with
it
by
clear
implication
that
you
can't
retaliate
against
an
employee
for
exercising
his
right
of
appeal.
if
you
did,
you
would
then
be
attempting
to
take
away
indirectly
what
the
law
has
conferred
directly
upon
the
employee,
the
right
of
appeal.
our
rules
and
regulations
forbid
discrimination.
it
also
provides
a
substantive
rule
in
respect
to
transfers.
you
can't
transfer
an
employee
and
have
them
meet
a
different
test
of
fitness.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
yes.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
yes.
that
is
not
the
record
here,
but,
yes.
i
would
say
that
that
hypothetical--
mr.
james
j.
wilson
--that
would
be
still
an
ad
hoc
decision.
yes.
of
the
policy
maker
or
whatever
harm
was
done.
that
would
be
our
position
on
it.
because
you
would
have
a
singular
employee
involved.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
i
think
it
might...
it
would
be
my
position
that
that
would
still
be
a
single
incident.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
that
would
be
my
position.
this
would
be
analogous
to
the
police
chase
where
you
had
the...
stretched
over
three
hours
and
umpteen
miles
and
there
were
different
shootings.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
i
don't
think
you
can
establish
a
custom
in
a
relationship
with
a
single
employee.
i
think
that
would
be
a
single
incident.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
if
confined
to
that
single
employee--
mr.
james
j.
wilson
--if
the
mayor
did
that,
under
our
interpretation,
the
mayor
would
be
a
policy
maker
for
certain
instances,
along
with
the
civil
service
commission,
that
would
be...
impose
municipal
liability
under
a
single
incident,
because
the
act,
the
impermissible
conduct
comes
from
the
policy
maker.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
yes,
until
it
would
take
on
the
custom
and
practice
which
would
have
to
be
developed
by
the
totality
of
facts.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
we
would
say
not.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
that
would
be
our
position.
your
honor,
could
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
james
j.
wilson
we
have
now
in
respondent's
argument
interjected
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
st.
louis
into
this
dispute.
i
would
like
to
in
reflecting
the
record
try
to
clarify
or
correct
what
i
think
have
been
some
mischaracterizations
of
it.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
the
mayor
ever
had
any
personal
involvement
with
the
plaintiff.
i
question
whether
or
not
he
knew
of
the
plaintiff.
the
plaintiff
was
a
middle
manager
city
planner.
we
were
involved
in
a
cutback
of
some
community
development
funds
that
caused
a
shortfall
of
$35
million
in
the
city
budget
and
what
was
attempted
to
be
done
was
to
transfer
functions
from
this
large
department,
the
community
development
agency,
to
various
other
city
agencies.
the
reference
that
the
mayor
knew
of
the
transfer
is
actually
a
reference
to
his
knowledge,
obviously,
that
functions
were
being
transferred.
the
plaintiff
attempted
at
various
times
to
involve
15
city
officials
into
this
dispute.
his
verdict
director
instruction,
though,
is
quite
clear.
and
i
would
read
from
it
that:
the
defendants
hamsher,
patterson
and
kindleberger
are
high
governmental
officials
with
the
right
to
make
policy
decisions.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
yes,
that
is
correct.
we
are
pointing
out,
though,
his
theory
of
the
case
in
no
way
is
directed
to
the
mayor
as
a
policy
maker.
mr.
james
j.
wilson
i
think,
justice
stevens,
i
think
we
get
to
the
point
of
attempting
to
identify
the
policy
maker
and
i
think
for
that
purpose
we
wanted
to
make
sure
that
it
was
clear
that
the
mayor,
who
may
be,
along
with
the
civil
service
commission,
to
be
a
policy
maker,
was
not
in
any
way
involved
in
this
particular
retaliatory
transfer.
it
was
found
by
the
eighth
circuit
to
be
the
act
of
the
defendant
hamsher.
and
i
think
that
is
the
question
is:
whether
or
not
the
defendant
hamsher
was
a
policy
maker
under
state
law.
in
respect
to
the
appeal
from
the
lay-off
that
mr.
oldham
described
which
i
would
have
to
disagree
with.
i
think
the
constructive
discharge
appeal
would
give
the
plaintiff
a
right
to
a
full
hearing,
either
before
the
civil
service
commission
or
under
our
state
law,
de
novo
in
the
circuit
court.
