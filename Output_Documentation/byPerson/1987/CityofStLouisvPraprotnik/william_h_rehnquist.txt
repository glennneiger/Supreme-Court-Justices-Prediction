chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-772,
the
city
of
st.
louis
v.
praprotnik.
mr.
wilson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
mr.
wilson.
i
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
oldham.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
there
a
change
in
the
office
of
mayor,
mr.
oldham,
sometime
during
these
proceedings--
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
same
mayor
make
all
of
these
decisions
that
you
are
talking
about?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
is
that
any
different
than
just
ordinary
respondents
responding
at
superior,
which
monell
said
that
they
were
not
going
to
settle
for
in
the
case
of
municipal
liability.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
can
create
a
policy,
but
i
thought
you
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
intimated
that
all
you
need
is
the
one
instance.
you
don't
need
any
policy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
that
really
is
just
indistinguishable
from
respondent's
superior?
isn't
it?
that
someone
acting
for
the
city
did
this.
it
violated
someone's
constitutional
right;
therefore,
the
city
is
liable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
oldham.
mr.
wilson,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
is
expired,
mr.
wilson.
the
case
is
submitted.
