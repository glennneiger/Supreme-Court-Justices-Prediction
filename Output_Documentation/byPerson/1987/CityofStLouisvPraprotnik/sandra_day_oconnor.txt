justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
wilson,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
they
could
determine
in
effect
whether
the
named
defendants
were
policy
makers;
were
they
not?
that
was
part
of
the
instructions.
justice
o'connor
and
you
did
not
object
to
that
instruction.
in
fact,
i
guess
it
was
one
that
you
prepared?
justice
o'connor
but
now
you
say
that
was
wrong?
justice
o'connor
was
there
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
the
jury
might
have
concluded
that
the
mayor
or
a
member
of
the
mayor's
cabinet
or
council
had
approved
the
transfer
knowing
that
it
was
in
retaliation
for--
justice
o'connor
--well,
i
asked
you
whether
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
a
jury
might
have
concluded
that
the
mayor
or
member
of
his
council
or
cabinet
had
approved
the
transfer
knowing
it
was
in
retaliation?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
a
lower
ranking
city
official
assumes
the
responsibility
for
making
decisions
that
could
be
interpreted
as
policy
decisions?
now,
are
there
circumstances
in
which
the
city
could
be
found
liable
for
the
exercise
of
those
decisions?
for
example,
if
higher
authority
knows
or
should
have
known
about
those
actions
of
lower
ranking
employees?
justice
o'connor
or
constructive
knowledge?
justice
o'connor
well,
by
that,
do
you
mean
they
had
to
approve
what
amounted
to
some
kind
of
reorganization
or
restructuring
of
city
agencies?
justice
o'connor
in
terms
of
what
a
specific
agency
would
do.
justice
o'connor
is
that
the
evidence
on
which
the
jury
was
able
to
determine,
if
it
did,
that
the
mayor
was
linked
to
this?
justice
o'connor
--mr.
oldham,
may
i
inquire
of
your
position
whether...
if
there
is
a
policy
making
person
or
body
of
the
city
in
charge
of
making
policy
for
employment
practices,
hiring,
transfers
and
discharge,
and;
if
a
lower
ranking
employee
supervisor
has
the
authority
to
actually
hire,
fire
and
transfer
people,
and,
if
that
lower
ranking
employee
decides
for
wholly
improper
reasons
to
make
a
retaliatory
transfer
and
constructive
discharge
of
an
employee
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
the
policy
making
body,
can
the
city
be
held
liable?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
so,
you
take
the
position
that
there
would
be
no
liability
under
the
example
i
gave
unless
there
was
actual
or
constructive
knowledge
and/or
approval
by
the
policy
making
body.
is
that
it?
justice
o'connor
and
do
you
take
the
position
that
here
the
mayor
was
the
policy
maker
or
the
civil
service
commission?
justice
o'connor
well,
was
the
civil
service
commission
the
policy
making
body?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
jury
can
determine
all
that?
who
is
the
policy
making
authority
for
the
city?
it
is
completely
open
for
the
jury
to
determine?
justice
o'connor
and
are
you
relying
on
the
constructive
discharge
theory
of
the
eighth
circuit,
here?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
agree
with
the
eighth
circuit?
is
that
the
theory?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
agree
with
the
final
authority
test.
do
you
agree
with
the
constructive
discharge
theory
that
the
court--
justice
o'connor
--was
the
jury
instructed
on
that
theory?
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
that
a
single
action
of
a
constructive
discharge,
even
if
known
by
the
mayor
can
subject
to
1983
liability?
justice
o'connor
well,
suppose
the
city
with
knowledge
of
its
mayor
just
makes
a
discharge
of
a
civil
service
employee
without
good
cause.
now,
does
that
result
in
1983
liability
if
the
city's
policy
is
clearly
stated
not
to
be
that.
justice
o'connor
a
single
decision?
justice
o'connor
mr.
oldham,
could
the
employee
who
alleges
a
constructive
discharge
by
virtue
of
a
transfer
file
an
appeal
with
the
civil
service
commission
and
get
it
heard?
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
wait
a
minute.
after
he
has
lost
his
job,
he
has
been
riffed
and
he
comes
in
and
he
says,
"i
was
constructively
discharged".
do
we
know
that
the
commission
would
not
consider
hearing
an
appeal?
justice
o'connor
because
it
was
already
in
court?
justice
o'connor
and
so
the
commission
said,
"as
long
as
you
are
in
court,
we
will
wait.
"
justice
o'connor
because
the
employee
chose
to
take
it
to
court?
justice
o'connor
a
suit
had
been
filed
by
your
client?
that's
why
you
were
in
court?
justice
o'connor
yes.
