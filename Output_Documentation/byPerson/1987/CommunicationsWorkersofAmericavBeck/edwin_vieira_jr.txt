mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
argument
we've
just
heard
from
mr.
gold
is
very
interesting
as
a
matter
of
policy
considerations,
but
i
believe
it's
somewhat
anachronistic
as
a
matter
of
law.
as
mr.
gold
himself
said,
we
are
not
writing
on
a
clean
slate.
we
are
not
back
in
1947
or
1948,
interpreting
section
8(a)(3)
as
if
we've
never
heard
anything
about
it
before
from
the
courts
or
even
from
congress.
forty
years
have
passed,
a
number
of
decisions
have
been
rendered
by
this
court
and
there
was
an
amendment
of
the
railway
labor
act
in
1951
to
give
us
an
equivalent
provision
in
section
211.
and
all
of
this
material
i
believe,
and
we
have
argued,
tends
rather
strongly,
if
not
compellingly,
to
put
to
one
side
the
policy
judgments
that
mr.
gold
is
urging,
and
to
come
to
something
of
a
different
conclusion.
now,
if
you'll
look
at
the
statute,
mr.
gold
says,
well,
the
plain
language
makes
it
an
open
and
shut
case.
of
course,
according
to
his
theory,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
would
allow
full-fledged
membership
in
a
labor
organization
to
be
required
by
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization
under
section
8(a)(3).
well,
very
early
on
in
the
history
of
taft-hartley
act
interpretation,
this
court
in
radio
officers
union
case
in
the
early
50s,
the
court
said
in
fact
that
wasn't
the
situation.
the
purpose
of
putting
in
the
amendments
to
8(a)(3)
was
not
to
allow
the
type
of
full
fledged
membership
control
that
i
think
would
be
required
by
mr.
gold's
interpretation,
but
to
force
employees
to
pay
a
monetary
sum
to
the
union.
monetary
sum
for
what
purpose?
i
get
back
then
to
the
question
of
dues
and
fees,
the
purpose
of
dues
and
fees.
obviously,
we
can't
interpret
this
statute
in
the
hyper-literalistic
way
that
mr.
gold
suggests,
because
the
court
hasn't
interpreted
the
statute
that
way.
the
language
of
8(a)(3)
talks
about
dues
and
fees
uniformly
required
as
a
condition
of
membership.
what
kind
of
membership
are
we
talking
about
here?
pattern
makers'
case,
a
couple
of
years
ago,
this
court
referred
to
voluntary
unionism
as
the
thrust
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
an
employee
could
not
be
required
to
become
a
full-fledged
member
of
the
union
and
he
could
resign
if
he
had
become
a
member
of
the
union
voluntarily.
he
could
not
be
forced
into
membership
through
an
8(a)(3)
agreement.
what
can
an
employee
be
forced
into
with
respect
to
a
union
with
respect
to
an
8(a)(3)-type
agreement?
it
is
the
status
of
accepting
the
union
as
the
employees'
exclusive
representative.
an
8(a)(3)
agreement
can
be
negotiated
only
by
a
section
9(a)
labor
organization.
what
is
a
section
9(a)
labor
organization?
it
is
an
organization
that
has
been
certified
by
the
nlrb
as
the
majority
representative
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining,
grievance
adjustment,
and
administration
of
collective
bargaining
agreements,
and
no
other
purpose.
that's
what
section
9(a)
says.
and
that's
what
section
8(d)
tells
us
about
collective
bargaining
where
it
defines
it
rather
specifically.
so
we're
talking
about
what
i
would
think,
and
certainly
suggest,
is
a
very
tightly
woven
set
of
provisions.
collective
bargaining
and
the
majority
representatives
through
9(a).
section
8(a)(3)
agreements
when
a
9(a)
labor
organization
has
become
the
representative
of
the
employees.
and
decisions
of
this
court
saying
that
the
membership
requirement
so
called
is
a
requirement
solely
directed
towards
compulsory
payment
of
dues
and
fees.
now,
this
makes
rather
operationally
good
sense.
an
employee
who
is
not
a
union
member
and
who
cannot
be
required
to
be
a
union
member
lawfully
nevertheless
can
be
required
to
pay
dues
and
fees
to
the
labor
organization
that
has
been
selected,
ostensibly
in
this
case
by
others
because
we're
talking
about
a
non-member,
by
others,
to
represent
him
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining.
and
from
that
seems
to
follow
very
nicely,
at
least
as
an
equitable
judgment,
that
the
dues
and
fees
should
be
limited
to
the
costs
that
that
union
incurs
in
performing
that
service.
now,
once
again,
the
statute
sets
up
a
mutual
system
of
liabilities
and
rights.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
they
said
that
in
the
railway
labor
act
in
1951.
congress
retrospectively--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--your
honor,
this
court
has
held
in
street,
in
allen,
and
in
ellis
that
that
somewhat
strange,
at
least
as
we're
using
the
term
now,
use
of
terminology
leads
to
the
conclusion
in
section
(2)(4)
that
only
collective
bargaining
costs
can
be
charged.
in
fact,
the
question
that
you
raised
to
mr.
gold
about
the
retirement
benefit
program
of
the
types
that
were
union,
i
recall
in
ellis
there
was
not
a
retirement
program,
but
there
was
a
death
benefit
program.
and
i
think
the
court
said
that
if
that
death
benefit
program
inured
only
to
the
benefit
of
union
members,
it
couldn't
be
charged.
so
we
had
a
situation
there
where
unions,
at
least
in
that
case
it
was
the
brotherhood
of
railway
clerks,
did
in
fact
set
up
out
of
dues
payments
a
similar
type
of
benefit
situation
which
it
did
not
extend
to
the
non-member.
let's
put
ourselves
in
the
position
of
senator
taft.
does
anyone
here
today
really
believe
that
if
we
had
senator
taft
in
this
room,
and
we
said,
senator,
did
you
write
section
8(a)(3)
and
then
(2)(4)
of
the
railway
labor
act,
and
really
intend
that
a
union
that
had
been
selected
as
the
majority
representative
of
dissenting
employees
could
collect
any
amount
of
money
from
those
employees
for
any
purpose
whatsoever
as
long
as
the
voluntarily
union
members
agree,
does
anyone
in
this
room
really
think
he
would
say,
yes?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
mr.
gold
agrees
that
he
comes
to
this
not
in
a
position
of
objectivity.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well
that's
an
interesting
question
as
to
what
was
required
under
section
8(a)(3).
we
have
rather
a
question
begging
interpretation
from
mr.
gold,
because
i
don't
recall
any
decision
of
this
court,
certainly,
that
ever
held
that
8(a)(3)
would
have
validated
the
type
of
thing
that
cwa
has
required
in
this
case.
in
fact,
i
recall
in
the
jones
and
laughlin
decision
in
1937,
that
in
fact,
it
was
held
that
employers
could
continue
to
deal
with
individual
employees,
notwithstanding
the
existence
of
majority
representative
in
the
unit.
so
we
probably
have
a
situation
that
was
quite
a
bit
closer
to
common
law
under
that
jones
and
laughlin
interpretation.
so
i'm
not
so
sure
that
we
can
simply
take
it
for
granted
that
8(a)(3)
would
have
been
interpreted
to
allow
at
least
what
mr.
gold
is
suggesting
cwa
is
demanding
in
this
case.
in
fact,
if
you
took
that
position,
you'd
come
rather
rapidly
to
an
interesting
constitutional
question,
perhaps
deeper
and
murkier
than
the
one
we
have
here.
let
me
address
that
for
one
moment,
because
mr.
gold
makes
the
argument
that
the
interpretation
of
section
(2)(4)
of
the
railway
labor
act
was
somehow
impelled
by
a
constitutional
consideration
which
he
finds
in
pre-emption
under
hanson.
as
i
recall,
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
said
that
it
was
not
merely
a
fairly
plausible
interpretation,
but
a
quite
reasonable
interpretation
of
section
(2)(4)
that
limited
dues,
fees,
and
in
that
particular
statute,
assessments
to
the
costs
of
collective
bargaining.
so
if
that
interpretation
was
reasonable
in
the
rla
context,
i
don't
see
why
the
same
language
is
not
capable
of
that
interpretation
in
the
national
labor
relations
context,
especially
when
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
statements
that
were
made
by
senator
taft
as
well
as
others
that
they
were
attempting
to
do
in
the
1951
amendment
to
the
rla,
essentially
the
same
thing
they
had
done
in
the
'47
amendment,
or
at
least
put
the
railway
labor
act
unions
in
the
same
position,
as
the
national
labor
relations
act
unions.
and
what
was
the
burden
of
the
testimony
that
had
been
given
by
the
rail
union
leaders
to
congress
cited
and
quoted.
in
the
street
opinion,
it
was
we
need
these
monies
to
pay
the
costs
of
the
exclusive
representational
services
that
we
are
required
by
law
to
provide
to
the
non-union
member.
and
there's
the
balance
in
the
system.
the
unions
are
required
by
law,
once
they
obtain
exclusive
representational
status,
to
provide
certain
benefits
to
non-union
employees
within
those
bargaining
units.
what
benefits
are
those?
the
benefits
of
collective
bargaining.
that's
what
they
can't
withhold.
they
don't
have
to
provide
political
representation.
they
don't
have
to
provide
social
representation.
they
don't
have
to
provide
union-only
retirement
funds.
they
have
to
provide
collective
bargaining
representation.
that
the
employee
must
accept,
and
he
can
demand.
and
because
he
can
demand
it
from
the
union,
congress
believed
it
only
fair
that
he
could
be
required
by
the
union
to
pay
some
commensurate
cost.
and
what
is
the
argument,
then,
that
makes--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well,
that's
true.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
it's
a
big
difference
in
the
sense
that
the
states
have
the
ability
to
interfere
in
this
act,
and
therefore
we
don't
have
a
primary
jurisdiction
problem
that
we
might
have
otherwise,
but
i'm
not
sure
it's
so
important
in
terms
of
the
effect
between
the
employee
and
the
union,
for
instance,
in
a
state
like
california,
which
doesn't
have
such
a
provision,
doesn't
have
a
right
to
work
law.
california
was
the
source
of
the
ellis
case.
i
think
on
cwa's
interpretation
that
pre-emption
somehow
has
the
controlling
force
over
whether
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
to
limit
dues
and
fees
to
collective
bargaining
costs,
one
would
seriously
question
whether
the
statute
would
have
been
interpreted
that
way
in
a
california
case.
i
mean,
why
doesn't
the
statutory
interpretation
change
under
the
railway
labor
act
depending
on
whether
you're
in
a
right
to
work
or
a
non-right
to
work
state?
that
brings
us
back
to
this
hanson
point
that
mr.
gold
made.
i
don't
think
the
statutory
construction
in
street
depends
upon
the
exclusive
reading
of
hanson
that
hanson
was
a
preemption
case.
hanson
talks
about
preemption
because
that
was
the
argument
raised
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
the
exclusive
argument,
i
take
it
the
nebraska
supreme
court
raised
was
they
had
to
decide
that
case
because
there
was
federal
preemption.
hanson
talks
about
federal
preemption
and
mr.
justice
douglas
goes
on
in
his
typically
terse
way
and
gives
two
or
three
other
bases.
he
cites
shelly
v.
cramer
and
he
cites
something
that's
much
more
important,
he
cites
steele
v.
louisville
&
nashville
railroad.
mr.
gold
didn't
mention
steele
v.
louisville
&
nashville
railroad.
maybe
he
will
when
he
gets
back
up.
that
has
to
be
the
key
to
the
entire
state
action
problem.
you
go
back
to
steele
v.
louisville
&
nashville
railroad,
the
court
was
very
concerned
there
that
a
union
with
exclusive
representational
status
could
use
that
status
through
collective
bargaining
to
discriminate
against
non-union
employees.
in
that
case,
it
was
a
racial
situation.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
absolutely.
it
was
just
the
kind
of
case
theoretically
that
we
have
here,
cooperation
between
the
union
and
the
employer
to
do
something
to
the
non-union
employee.
in
that
case,
it
was
a
racial
discrimination
case.
the
court
took
one
look
at
that
and
said,
this
union
has
been
empowered
by
congress
with
a
quasi-legislative
status.
and
if
some
limitation
is
not
put
on
the
exercise
of
power
pursuant
to
that
status
to
prevent
this
type
of
discrimination,
arbitrary,
discriminatory
or
in
bad
faith,
is
the
rubric,
the
jargon,
constitutional
questions
would
arise.
not
constitutional
questions
about
the
status
of
the
representative.
that
was
obvious
and
clear.
constitutional
questions
as
to
the
validity
of
transferring
that
kind
of
power
to
a
labor
organization.
now,
the
structure
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
the
structure--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--excuse
me?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
only
when
it's
exercising
its
9(a)
power.
and
the
problem
of
the
9(a)
power
exercise
has
been
solved
in
essence
by
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
that
is,
the
quid
pro
quo
then
again
for
the
union
to
have
this
quasi-legislative
power
was
that
it
would
exercise
it
within
the
bounds
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
so
we
don't
have
the
horror
that
mr.
gold
raises
in
his
brief.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
the
union
cannot
make--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--the
union
cannot
make
a
section
8(a)(3)
agreement
unless
it
is
a
9(a)
representative,
so
says
the
statute.
the
9(a)
representational
status
is
the
infusion
of
governmental
action.
that
is
what
gives
the
union
its
quasi-legislative
power
over
these
employees.
otherwise,
it
would
have
no
power
over
them
at
all.
it
couldn't
require
them
to
pay
dues,
it
couldn't
require
them
to
accept
and
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
it
might
make
with
an
employer.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
an
interesting
situation
for
the
voluntary
union
members
to
sue
their
own
union.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
so
the
question
you're
positing
would
be
would
governmental
action
be
infused
in
an
internal
union
decision
because
the
union
is
exercising
some
powers
as
a
9(a)
representative.
and
i
take
it
we
have
the
case
in
which
some
members
of
the
union
were
black
and
some
members
of
the
union
were
white,
and
the
union
hierarchy
made
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
discriminated
against
all
blacks
in
the
bargaining
unit,
would
some
of
those
union
members
be
entitled
to
sue
that
union
in
a
duty
of
fair
representation
case
or
a
quasi-constitutional
case.
and
the
answer
is,
yes.
if
they
didn't
use
eeoc
or
some
other
equivalent,
the
answer
is,
yes.
if
the
union
is
exercising
its
9(a)
authority
in
an
invalid
way,
the
answer
is,
yes.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
we
go
back
to
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
what
steele
did
was
to
say
all
of
those
constitutional
questions
which
might
arise
in
the
invidious
use
of
this
9(a)
status
will
be
lumped
together
and
treated
by
this
thing
we
call
the
dfr.
that's
the
solution
to
the
constitutional
problem.
we're
not
going
to
have
a
constitutional
conundrum
come
up
every
time
a
union
negotiates
some
provision
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
they
created
the
duty
of
fair
representation
in
that
case.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
they
found
it
in
the
statute.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
if
they
found
it
there,
it
must
have
been
there.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
at
the
time
that
congress
created
the
statute.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
the
impetus
for
finding
it,
the
light
by
which
they
found
it
was
the
recognition
that
if
they
couldn't
find
it,
they
had
another
problem.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
we
didn't
have
it
there.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
yes.
their
problem
was
that
there
wasn't
a
judicial
remedy
for
what
had
happened
for
the
discrimination.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
forming
the
original
discriminatory
agreement,
yes.
they
wouldn't
hear
any--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
the
court
in
steele
came
back
to
powers
of
the
union.
i
think
the
problem
that
you're
discussing
was
that
if
they
hadn't
created
a
judicial
remedy,
there
would
have
been
no
remedy
available
for
this
discrimination.
that
was
the
difficulty.
if
there
hadn't
been
a
judicial
forum,
it
couldn't
have
been
redressed
at
all.
now,
that
brings
us,
i
supposed,
to
the
primary
jurisdiction
question
with
the
national
labor
relations
board,
which
the
court
asked
us
to
address,
and
no
one
has
addressed
it
here.
i
think
that's
a
very
simple
question,
because
congress
has
already
determined
that
these
8(a)(3)
agreements
are
not
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
that's
what
14(d)
seems
to
tell
us.
let
the
states
do
it
if
they
want.
let
state
courts
become
involved,
state
legislatures,
state
administrative
agencies,
for
that
matter.
it's
not
exclusively
a
question
of
the
nlrb.
so
we
do
have
a
judicial
approach
but
it
was
a
judicial
approach
that
was
created
in
steele
or
found
in
steele,
the
duty
of
fair
representation
approach.
and
it
solves
all
the
possible
constitutional
difficulties
because
if
a
union
is
exercising
its
9(a)
authority
within
the
boundaries
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
there
is
no
further
constitutional
inquiry.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
it's
not
simply
governmental
permission.
there's
governmental
permission
for
the
employer
and
the
union--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well,
they
have
disabled
the
non-union
employee
from
doing
anything
about
that.
he
had
a
previous
set
of
rights
prior
to
the
wagner
act
that
would
have
enabled
him
to
take
certain
kinds
of
action
directly
or
with
the
employer.
most
of
these
agreements--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--true.
but
it's
putting
the
union
in
the
position
of
being
the
coercive
elected
bargaining
representative
of
these
employees,
and
completely
disabling
them
from
taking
any
route
to
their
employer--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--that's
right.
and
we
have
stripped
the
non-member
of
any
rights
that
he
may
have
previously
had.
let's
recall
that.
allis
chalmers
and
vacca,
he's
been
stripped
of
the
previously
existing
rights,
allis
chalmers,
he's
been
stripped
of
his
previously
existing
remedies,
vacca.
now,
i
don't
know
what
governmental
action
means
if
it
doesn't
mean
a
situation
where
someone
has
been
stripped
of
his
rights
and
remedies.
if
that's
not
governmental
action,
what
the
heck
is
it?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
in
terms
of
whether
9(a)
is
governmental
action?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
steele.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
street
in
terms
of
the
interpretation
of
the
language
of
(2)(4),
the
exact
parallel
language
to
8(a)(3).
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
even
better
for
us.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
i
agree
wholeheartedly
with
the
opinion
that
that
was
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute.
and
it's
just
as
a
reasonable
here.
the
language
is
the
same.
the
only
difference
in
the
railway
labor
act
is
the
word
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
well,
if
assessments
are
used
for
improper
purposes,
they'll
be
treated
the
same
way
as
dues
and
fees.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
excellent.
if
it's
a
statutory
case,
we
forget
about
state
action.
we
have
presented
to
us
from
cwa,
a
very
insistent
argument
that
this
is
not
a
statutory
case,
to
which
i
say,
fine,
we'll
do
the
constitutional
side
of
the
argument.
you
can
have
one
side
of
the
record
or
the
other,
it
goes
both
ways.
but
it
can
be
treated
very
simply
as
consistent
with
a
whole
line
of
things.
we're
not
simply
talking
about
the
railway
labor
act,
public
sector
collective
bargaining.
in
abood,
this
court
looked
at
the
precedents
under
both
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
railway
labor
act,
and
then
said,
we
have
a
consistent
pattern
here.
exclusive
representation,
these
fees
being
paid
for
the
cost
of
collective
bargaining.
so
we
had
a
coherent
labor
relations
structure
seen
in
abood,
and
now
we
have
a
discordant
note
being
put
in
by
cwa
saying,
well,
let's
go
back
to
1947
and
remake
everything.
it's
1988.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
remade.
it
can't
be
remade
without
creating
quite
an
anomaly.
certainly
in
the
administration
law,
here
you
have
a
union
that
represents
employees
in
the
public
sector,
it
represents
employees
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
it
represents
employees
under
the
railway
labor
act.
you
can
have
employees
represented
by
cwa
working
within
a
block
of
each
other
under
the
public
sector
acts
and
the
railway
labor
act.
they're
being
charged
only
dues
and
fees
for
collective
bargaining
costs.
across
the
street,
employees
performing
the
same
functions
are
being
charged
anything
cwa
wants
to
charge
on
the
same
language
in
these
statutes.
is
this
a
sensible
way
to
run
a
railroad?
i
don't
think
it's
a
sensible
way
to
run
national
labor
policy.
i
think
the
simple
answer
to
this
case
has
been
the
course
of
history
in
the
past
40
years.
whatever
might
have
been
a
reading
of
the
1947
act
in
1947
or
1948,
we've
gone
beyond
that.
this
court
has
gone
beyond
it.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
number
one,
i
don't
think
that
you've
made
a
mistake.
as
i
say,
i
think
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
given
in
street
was
perfectly
reasonable.
and
number
two,
there
has
been
a
tremendous
amount
of
reliance
on
these
interpretations.
if
you're
going
to
go
back
now
and
say,
oh,
we
were
wrong,
if
you
want
to
say
you
were
wrong,
i
can't
stop
you.
if
you
want
to
go
back
and
say,
we
were
wrong,
you
open
up
not
only
some
interesting
statutory
questions,
but
you
open
up
some
very
deep
and
dark
constitutional
waters
in
these
cases.
and
i'm
saying
that
what
happened
in
street
was
a
perfectly
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
fits
what
i
think
is
the
primary
intention
that
you
can
read
out
of
the
structure
of
the
act.
make
the
employee
who
is
not
a
member
pay
for
the
services
he
receives
from
the
union,
and
we
know
that
the
statute
limits
the
services
that
can
be
forced
on
that
employee
to
the
9(a)
representational
services
that
the
union
performs
as
a
collective
bargaining
agent.
so
it
all
works
operationally,
it
follows
street,
allen,
ellis,
the
public
sector
cases.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
not
if
they
keep
their
books
straight.
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
what
happened
with
this
particular
union
was
it
was
not
keeping
its
books
in
a
manner
that
allowed
it
to
make
these
segregations,
whereas
cwa,
itself,
now
tells
us
that
it
has
a
new
system
in
this
case
that
will
allow
it
to
do
that,
and
it
is
solving
this
knotty
problem
in
the
public
sector.
it
certainly
has
to
do
it
in
the
public
sector,
it
certainly
has
to
do
it
under
the
railway
labor
act.
why
can't
it
take
those
same
books
and
records
and
apply
them
to
the
national
labor
relations
act?
i
don't
see
the
difficulty.
well,
it's
living
up
to
abood,
it's
living
up
to
street.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
and
i
think
as
soon
as
this
court
rules
that
it
has
to
live
up
to
beck,
it
will
do
the
same
thing
here.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
he's
arguably
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
under
those
two
provisos
in
8(a)(3),
if
he's
correct,
if
the
union
has
not
in
fact
charged
john
jones.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
all
right.
so
we're
taking
the
case
where
there's
no
question
of
the
legality
of
the
fee?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
it's
the
employer
has
violated.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
oh,
yes.
that's
our
problem
here.
he's
required...
we
accept
that...
he's
required
to
collect.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
he
has
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
he
made
with
the
union
that
was
imposed
on
him
through
a
9(a)
representational
arrangement.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
thank
you.
