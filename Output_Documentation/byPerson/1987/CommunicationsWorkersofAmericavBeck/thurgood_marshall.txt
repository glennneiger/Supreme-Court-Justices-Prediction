marshall
in
cooperation
with
the
employer.
justice
marshall
yes,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
everything
the
union
does
is
required
by
law.
justice
marshall
what
was
involved
with
steele
was
only
the
cooperation
of
the
brotherhood
and
the
railroad
in
refusing
to
promote
negro
firemen,
period.
that
was
all
that
was
in
that
case.
justice
marshall
they
did?
justice
marshall
i
thought
the
statute
did.
justice
marshall
well,
you
don't
have
any
mediation
board
here,
do
you?
justice
marshall
you
don't
have
the
mediation
board
involved
in
this
case,
do
you?
justice
marshall
you
didn't.
justice
marshall
wasn't
that
case,
didn't
that
case
say
that
the
members
of
the
mediation
board
cooperated
with
the
brotherhood
in
discriminating
against
the
negro
firemen,
period.
justice
marshall
so
you
don't
have
the
mediation
board
here,
do
you?
isn't
that
the
difference
between
the
two
cases?
justice
marshall
one's
the
railroad
and
the
mediation
board,
and
this
is
a
non-railroad
and
no
mediation
board.
justice
marshall
yes.
