justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
first
of
the
two
cases
is
communications
workers
of
america
versus
beck,
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
section
8(a)(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
permits
an
employer
and
a
union
to
enter
into
an
agreement
requiring
all
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
to
pay
union
dues
as
a
condition
of
continued
employment,
whether
or
not
the
employees
become
union
members.
the
petitioner
union
entered
into
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
that
contains
a
union-security
clause
under
which
all
represented
employees
who
do
not
become
union
members
must
pay
the
union
agency
fees
in
amounts
equal
to
the
dues
paid
by
union
members.
respondents
who
are
bargaining
unit
employees
who
chose
not
to
become
union
members
filed
a
suite
in
federal
district
court
challenging
the
union's
use
of
their
agency
fees
for
the
purposes
other
than
collective-bargaining,
contract
administration,
or
grievance
adjustment.
they
alleged
that
expenditure
of
their
fees
on
activities
such
as
organizing
the
employees
of
other
employers,
lobbying
for
labor
legislation
and
participating
in
social,
charitable
and
political
events
violated
the
union's
duty
of
fair
representation
section
8(a)(3)
and
the
first
amendment.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
union's
collection
and
disbursement
of
agency
fees
for
the
purposes
other
than
collective-bargaining
activities
violated
the
associational
and
free
speech
rights
of
objecting
nonmembers,
and
granted
injunctive
relief
and
an
order
for
the
reimbursement
of
excess
fees.
the
court
of
appeals
preferring
to
rest
of
its
judgment
on
a
ground
other
than
the
constitution,
ultimately
concluded
that
the
collection
of
nonmembers'
fees
for
purposes
unrelated
to
collective-bargaining
violated
the
union's
duty
of
fair
representation.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
courts
below
properly
exercised
jurisdiction
of
respondents'
claims
that
exactions
of
agency
fees
beyond
those
necessary
to
finance
collective-bargaining
activities
violated
the
judicially
created
duty
of
fair
representation
and
also
violated
respondents'
first
amendment
rights.
we
hold
further
that
section
8(a)(3)
does
not
permit
a
union
over
the
objections
of
dues
paying
nonmember
employees
to
expend
the
funds
collected
from
them
on
activities
unrelated
to
collective-bargaining
activities.
the
case
is
controlled
belied
by
a
decision
in
machinists
versus
street
some
years
ago.
and
that
case
involved
section
2
eleventh
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
not
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
is
what
is
involved
in
the
case
before
us
today.
but
section
2
eleventh
of
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
permit
a
union
over
the
objections
of
nonmembers
to
expend
union
agency
fees
and
political
causes
and
therefore,
street
is
controlling
because
section
8(a)(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
section
2
eleventh
of
the
railway
labor
act
are
in
all
material
respects
identical
and
the
canon
of
statutory
construction
that
the
same
language
in
two
statutes
we
constitute
in
light
fashions
as
particularly
applicable
here
where
the
statutory
equivalent
reflects
the
fact
that
the
two
provisions
were
born
on
the
same
congressional
concerns.
section
8(a)(3)
was
intended
to
correct
the
abuses
of
compulsory
unionism
developed
under
closed
shop
agreements.
at
the
same
time,
we
require
through
union
security
clauses
that
nonmember
employees
pay
their
share
the
cost
of
benefits
secured
by
the
unions
through
collective-bargaining.
and
those
same
concerns
prompted
congress'
later
amendment
of
the
railway
labor
act.
given
this
parallel
purposes,
the
structure
and
language
of
8(a)(3)
and
section
2
eleventh,
both
provisions
must
be
interpreted
we
believe
in
the
same
manner.
only
the
most
compelling
evidence
would
support
a
contrary
conclusion
and
petitioners
have
not
proffered
such
evidence
here.
justice
blackmun
joined
by
justice
o'connor
and
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
case.
