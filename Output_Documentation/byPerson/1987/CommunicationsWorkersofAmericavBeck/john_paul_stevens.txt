justice
stevens
mr.
gold,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
that
justice
scalia's
question
raises
in
my
mind.
supposing
that
a
district
judge
held
in
this
hypothetical
example
that
the
amount
the
excess
part
of
the
dues
that
was
used
to
fund
pensions
for
union
members
only
should
not
really
be
considered
dues
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
therefore
enjoined
collection
of
the
excess.
would
you
say
that
such
a
holding
was
tantamount
to
holding
the
union
shop
unlawful.
see,
you're
arguing
that
the
union
shop
is
definitely
lawful,
and
i'm
just
wondering
whether
that
really
addresses
the
question
that
justice
scalia
asked.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
it's
conceivable...
i
don't
know
as
much
history
as
you
do
in
this
area...
but
it's
conceivable
that
what
was
known
in
1946
was
a
form
of
union
dues
which
was
used
exclusively
for
things
like
collective
bargaining,
and
that
premiums
for
the
benefit
of
the
membership
only
and
not
for
non-members
would
not
be
treated
as
union
dues
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
including
the
purposes
at
issue
in
this
case,
mr.
gold?
justice
stevens
so
that,
i'm
really
troubled
by
the
prospect
that
i
gave
you
in
my
hypothetical,
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
in
order
to
decide
this
case,
we
really
don't
have
to
decide
that
hypothetical.
we
could
just
say
that
certainly
anything
that
dues
were
used
for
in
1946
dues
can
be
used
for
today.
justice
stevens
and
if
some
particular
union
should
come
up
with
the
kind
of
scheme
i
just
described,
which
i
take
it
you're
not
familiar
with
anywhere,
are
you?
