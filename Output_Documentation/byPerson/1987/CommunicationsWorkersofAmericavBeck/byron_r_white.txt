justice
white
well,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
union
is
always
in
the
status
of
exercising
official
power.
justice
white
what's
steele
got
to
do
with
this
particular
case
about
the
right
of
the
union
to
charge
dues
equal
to
the
dues
charged
union
members?
justice
white
why
is
that
a
state
action?
justice
white
i
suppose
if
the
union
didn't
negotiate
this
kind
of
an
agreement,
and
just
didn't
charge
the
non-members
anything,
i
suppose
the
union
could
be
sued
by
its
members
saying
you're
not
fairly
representing
us.
you're
just
not
collecting
from
the
people
you're
serving.
and
that
also
would
be
official
action,
i
take
it?
justice
white
it
might
be
very
interesting,
but
not
unheard
of.
they
do
it
all
the
time.
at
least
those
kind
of
cases
seem
to
seep
into
this
court
every
now
and
then.
justice
white
it
was
always
there,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
right,
right.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
under
more
recent
cases,
is
just
governmental
permission
to
engage
in
a
course
of
conduct,
does
that
make
the
person
who
engages
in
that
conduct,
is
he
wielding
official
power?
justice
white
well,
the
government
says,
you
may
extract
these
membership
fees
from
non-members
if
you
want
to,
but
you
don't
have
to.
go
ahead
if
you
want
to.
that's
what
the
act
said,
isn't
it?
justice
white
so
it's
only
because
of
the
position
the
union
has
a
collective
bargaining
agency
that
permits
negotiating
anything
on
behalf
of
a
non-union
member.
justice
white
so
if
you
decide
to
do
it,
you
can
do
it
over
the
objections
of
the
non-member
because
we
say
so,
because
the
law
says
so.
justice
white
which
of
our
cases
comes
closest
to
agreeing
with
you
on
this?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
how
about
the
railway
labor
act
cases?
do
any
of
them
come
close
to
this?
justice
white
well,
street
was
really
a
statutory
case,
i
guess.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
a
statutory
case
really
doesn't--
justice
white
--well,
i
know,
but
if
it's
a
statutory
case,
whether
it's
state
action
or
not
really
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
white
well,
what
happens
if
an
employer
refuses
to
collect
this
fair
fee
from
non-members
and
says,
i
won't
fire...
i
know
that
john
jones
isn't
paying,
but
i
won't
fire
him.
is
he
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
white
yes,
but
there's
no
argument
but
what
the
union
wants
to
collect
from
him
is
fair.
the
employer
just
says,
sorry,
i
don't
believe
in
this
law.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
so
he
is
required
to
collect.
justice
white
and
that's
only
by
virtue
of
the
coercive
nature
of
the
federal
law?
justice
white
yes.
