mr.
laurence
e.
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
communication
workers
of
america,
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
are
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
a
group
of
employees
who
work
for
the
american
telephone
and
telegraph
company
as
it
then
was
when
this
case
began,
and
various
of
its
subsidiaries.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
the
respondents
here,
are
a
group
of
individuals
who
work
for
a
bell
telephone
company
in
an
organized
bargaining
unit
which
is
covered
by
a
union
security
provision,
namely
a
provision
requiring
that
an
amount
equal
to
the
dues
charged
by
the
union
to
its
members
are
paid
by
all
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
thirty
days
after
they
become
employed,
as
a
condition
of
continued
employment.
this
case
began
when
a
group
of
twenty
employees
sued
to
invalidate
that
requirement
and
to
limit
the
requirement
to
an
amount
equal
to
what
the
union
pays
for
what
can
be
defined
in
various
ways
but
can
be
said
to
be
for
activities
germane
to
collective
bargaining.
the
district
court
on
constitutional
grounds
and
eventually
an
en
banc
court
of
appeals
by
a
vote
of
six
of
the
judges
on
different
grounds
held
that
the
plaintiffs
had
stated
a
valid
federal
cause
of
action,
and
that
the
relief
prayed
for
should
be
granted.
the
second
circuit
concluded
to
the
opposite
effect,
holding
that
all
of
the
federal
claims
made
by
the
plaintiffs,
one
of
which
is
based
on
section
8(a)(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
another
which
is
based
on
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
the
final
one
of
which
is
based
on
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution,
are
without
merit.
the
case
is
here
on
our
petition.
the
national
labor
relations
act
treats
with
the
question
presented
here
in
terms,
and
i'd
like
to
begin
by
directing
the
court
to
the
language
of
section
8(a)(3)
which
is
set
out
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief
on
the
merits,
the
blue
brief.
section
8(a)(3)
of
the
nlra
prohibits
in
general
terms
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
union
membership
and
union
activity.
section
8(a)(3)
then
has
two
provisos,
the
first
of
which
in
essence
was
in
the
law
in
1935,
and
the
second
of
which
was
added
in
1947.
the
first
proviso
says
in
effect
that
nothing
in
this
subchapter
or
in
any
other
statute
of
the
united
states
shall
preclude
the
type
of
union
security
agreement
at
issue
here.
and
the
second
proviso
in
its
second
clause,
the
one
labeled
(b),
which
is
on
page
2-a
of
the
appendix,
says
that
no
employer
may
under
these
provisos
discharge
any
individual
if
he
has
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
membership
in
the
union
was
denied
or
terminated
for
reasons
other
than
the
failure
of
the
employee
to
tender
the
periodic
dues
and
the
initiation
fees
uniformly
required
as
a
condition
of
acquiring
or
retaining
membership.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
think
both
provisos
are
provisos
to
the
basic
prohibition.
i
think
the
two
provisos
are
intended
to
be
read
and
have
been
read
together,
each
one
of
the
conditions
stated
in
the
two
provisos
have
to
be
satisfied
for
the
clause
to
be
lawful
and
to
impose
the
requirement.
and
as
this
court
has
concluded
in
both
the
schermerhorn
and
the
general
motors
cases,
what
the
provisos
under
the
nlra
taken
together
mean,
at
the
very
least...
and
we're
going
to
find
out
in
this
case
whether
they
mean
more...
but
what
they
mean
at
the
very
least
is
that
an
individual
who
says
i
am
willing
to
pay
the
initiation
fee
charged
by
the
union
which
is
the
exclusive
representative,
and
i
am
willing
to
pay
the
periodic
dues
uniformly
charged
to
members,
cannot
be
dismissed
from
employment
by
the
employer
without
violating
section
8(a)(3).
so
in
terms
of
the
plain
language
of
section
8(a)(3),
it
seems
to
us
as
we
have
argued
throughout
and
as
the
second
circuit
held,
that
this
case
is
an
open
and
shut
case.
congress
did
not
say
simply
that
individuals
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
this
kind
would
be
required
to
pay
undefined
dues
leaving
an
ambiguity
as
the
respondents
claim.
rather
the
statute
imposes
a
clear
requirement,
namely,
that
to
be
lawful,
these
agreements
can
go
no
further
than
the
dues
and
initiation
fees
uniformly
required
as
a
condition
of
acquiring
or
retaining
membership.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
first
of
all
on
initiation
fees,
congress
did
decide
to
regulate
the
amounts
in
part
for
the
type
of
concern
that
you've
stated.
secondly,
with
regard
to
dues,
in
1947,
the
house
proposed
to
regulate
dues
to
assure
that
they
were
reasonable,
they
weren't
too
high,
they
were
used
for
purposes
that
are
called
proper
under
the
circumstances,
and
the
senate
refused,
saying
there
should
not
be
such
regulation.
it
seems
to
us
that
putting
aside
the
illumination
one
gets
from
the
evolution,
that
when
you
talk
about
the
amount
uniformly
required
to
maintain
your
good
standing
membership
in
the
organization,
it's
the
amount
uniformly
required
without
regard
to
how
it
is
thereafter
used.
that
is
the
amount
that
each
person
who
is
a
member
and
chooses
to
continue
to
be
a
member
is
charged.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
for
a
good
reason,
and
certainly
would
have
preferred
the
language
you
just
articulated.
congress
took
away
from
unions,
not
only
the
closed
shop,
but
also
took
away
from
unions
the
ability
to
charge
as
a
condition
of
continued
employment
those
who
didn't
want
to
be
voluntary
members
assessments
and
fines
and
non-periodic
payments
of
those
kind.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
sure.
of
course
they
would
have
been
uniform.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
if
everybody,
in
other
words,
it
is
normal
and
the
language
of
the
railway
labor
act
to
which
we
will
get
in
a
minute
is
different
in
this
regard.
it
is
normal
for
unions
to
charge
assessments
in
addition
to
dues.
for
example,
some
unions
have
a
practice
of
charging
each
member
two
dollars
a
month
to
be
a
member.
in
addition,
there
is
a
once
yearly
charge
of
three
dollars
which
is
payable
only
once
a
year
to
fund
a
convention.
in
the
language
of
the
trade,
that's
an
assessment,
and
assessments
are
uniform,
but
they
are
not
periodic
in
the
sense
that
the
statute
has
been
understood.
and
therefore,
an
individual
in
a
position
of
the
objecting
payors
in
this
case
cannot
under
the
nlra
be
required
to
pay
the
assessment.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
if
the
union
can,
and
the
landrom-griffin
act
provides
that
you
have
to
get
membership
approval,
as
opposed
to
the
situation
of
public
bodies
where
the
representative
can
act,
provide
that
where
the
union
goes
to
its
members
and
says
we
want
x
dues
and
makes
the
case
to
them,
and
then
each
month
or
each
quarter
someone
has
to
pay
that,
that
is
dues.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no
matter
what.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
having
a
party?
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
that
is
this
statute.
and
that
was
the
understanding
of
the
time.
in
terms
of
the
understanding
of
the
time,
let
me
also
point
out
that
at
the
very
time
congress
was
dealing
with
this
question,
it
passed
what
is
the
precursor
of
the
present
federal
election
campaign
act,
which
applies
to
unions
and
corporations,
and
prohibited
unions
from
using
any
portion
of
their
dues
or
initiation
fees
or
assessments
for
the
purpose
of
making
political
expenditures
and
contributions
in
federal
elections
as
those
terms
are
defined
in
those
acts.
so
congress
understood
quite
well
that
unions
use
dues
for
a
variety
of
purposes,
and
have
traditionally
funded
their
activities
from
dues.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
had
hoped
we
had
dealt
with
it
more,
but
let
me
go
back
to
the
language
of
the
first
proviso
of
8(a)(3).
the
proviso
says
that
nothing
in
this
subchapter
or
in
any
other
statute
of
the
united
states
shall
invalidate
the
kinds
of
agreements
that
are
permitted
under
this
section.
our
position
on
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
the
following:
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
as
implied
from
section
9(a)
and
from
the
nlra
as
a
whole,
to
read
the
duty
to
invalidate
that
which
congress
chose
after
the
most
careful
consideration
and
heated
debate
not
to
invalidate
would
be
contrary
to
all
the
theories
of
statutory
interpretation
and
of
elaborating
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
the
statute
of
which
we
are
aware.
we
do
not
believe
that
you
can
take
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and
say
that
union
activity,
which
congress
decided
expressly
to
permit,
is
invidious
or
improper
under
a
judge-made
rule
using
the
general
terms
of
the
duty.
the
duty
it
seems
to
us
has
its
metes
and
bounds
delineated
by
that
which
congress
specifically
decided
in
this
statute
to
permit
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
while
not
prohibiting
the
states,
i
would
add,
from
reaching
a
contrary
conclusion.
at
the
time
of
the
1947
act,
twelve
states
made
it
unlawful
to
have
any
form
of
union
security,
and
at
the
present
time,
the
number
is
20.
but
it
is
a
federal
question
here.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
court,
as
justice
o'connor
just
stated,
does
not
write
on
a
blank
slate
here.
this
is
an
issue
which
has
been
visited
from
the
hanson
case
on
through
the
hudson
case
most
recently,
both
under
the
railway
labor
act,
and
under
the
nlra.
it
seems
to
us
that
with
regard
to
the
nlra,
there
are
two
critical
differences
that
explain
why
this
case
is
to
be
decided
differently
from
the
rla
case.
first
of
all,
as
we
develop
at
length
in
our
brief,
the
starting
point
for
legislative
consideration
was
at
the
exact
opposite
ends
of
the
spectrum
in
this
act,
and
in
the
rla.
in
this
act,
congress
approached
the
problem
against
a
background
where,
as
i
say,
except
for
twelve
states
in
1947,
all
forms
of
union
security
including
the
closed
shop
which
required
that
an
individual
in
order
to
get
a
job
in
the
first
place
be
a
full
member
of
the
labor
organization
which
had
negotiated
the
agreement
were
lawful.
and
there
were
many
who
believed
that
the
federal
law
should
not
invalidate
even
the
closed
shop.
it
was
the
view
of
the
majority
in
congress
at
that
time
who
were
operating
against
the
fact
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
did
not
agree
with
then
and
had
vetoed
legislation
in
'46,
and
had
said
he
would
veto
it
again,
that
union
security
should
be
regulated
to
some
extent.
and
as
i
said,
and
if
you'll
look
at
the
senate
report,
the
section
dealing
with
union
security
begins
with
a
phrase
to
the
effect
that
this
is
a
most
contentious
issue
to
which
we've
given
the
most
mature
consideration.
and
the
conclusion
of
the
sponsors
and
leaders
of
the
republican
party
in
the
congress
was
that
the
closed
shop
should
be
invalidated
and
that
the
union
shop
which
provided
for
dues
should
continue
to
be
permitted
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
but
not
required
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
and
should
continue
to
be
subject
to
regulation
by
the
states.
and
i
would
like
in
particular
we
lay
out
a
good
deal
of
the
legislative
history
but
in
terms
of
the
sense
of
what
that
congress
believed
was
fair
and
proper
under
the
circumstances,
taking
all
the
realities
into
account,
i
think
that
senator
taft's
statement,
which
we
reproduced
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
is
a
particularly
succinct
summary
of
the
feeling
at
the
time.
he
said,
"the
great
difference
between
the
closed
shop
and
the
union
shop
is
that
under
the
union
shop
in
the
first
instance,
a
man
can
get
a
job
without
joining
the
union
or
asking
favors
of
the
union.
"
"the
fact
that
the
employee
will
have
to
pay
dues
to
the
union
seems
to
me
to
be
much
less
important.
"
"the
important
thing
is
that
the
man
will
have
the
job.
"
now,
different
people
can
reach
different
conclusions
about
whether
that
went
far
enough.
but
that
was
the
view
at
the
time.
the
closed
shop
which
gave
the
union
authority
over
jobs
was
to
be
ended.
the
union
shop
which
had
always
required
an
equality
of
sacrifice,
financial
sacrifice
by
all
in
the
shop
ought
to
be
continued.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
think
there
are
two
questions
in
terms
of
what
you've
asked.
the
first
would
be,
is
that
a
fair
construction
of
nlra
section
8(a)(3).
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it
is
our
submission
that
it
is
not
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
do
not
believe
that
such
an
interpretation
is
in
the
strict
sense
invalidating
the
union
shop
in
the
sense
of
overturning,
while
admitting
that
it
is
being
overturned.
but
i
do
believe
that
the
task
of
statutory
construction,
in
judge
learned
hand's
phrase,
is
to
recreate
the
gamut
of
values
at
the
time
and
the
gamut
of
values
at
the
time
was
to
preserve
that
which
had
been
in
existence
up
through
1947,
which
did
not
permit
that
kind
of
limitations.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
can
only
in
that
regard
since
i'm
hardly
a
dispassionate
observer,
refer
you
to
justice
frankfurter's
dissenting
opinion
in
street
with
regard
to
the
facts
of
the
matter.
unions
have
always
funded
a
variety
of
activities
out
of
dues.
nobody
understood
that
better
than
senator
taft
the
reason
the
corrupt
practices
act
is
in
the
nlra
is
that
the
cio
made
it
its
endeavor
to
attempt
to
defeat
senator
taft
and
they
failed.
there
was
a
general
understanding
that
these
were
used
for
a
variety
of
purposes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
it
isn't
rather
i'd
rather
have
the
whole
loaf
or
not.
i
believe
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
as
a
referent
was
what
is
uniformly
charged
to
people
to
be
a
member
of
the
union
and
that
congress
has
regulated
how
unions
spend
their
monies
other
ways
than
this.
but
i
want
to
if
i
can
advance
to
the
difference
between
what
i've
just
described
since
my
time
is
running
out
and
the
situation
in
1951.
in
1951,
when
congress
amended
the
railway
labor
act
to
put
in
similar
language,
the
situation
was
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
all
forms
of
union
security
were
unlawful.
and
congress
again
made
a
compromise,
but
it
was
moving
from
the
other
side.
and
this
court
was
convinced
from
the
history
of
the
rla
that
it
was
fairly
possible
to
read
the
rla
as
only
permitting
the
collection
of
an
amount
of
money
equal
to
the
amount
expended
for
collective
bargaining.
even
more
important
in
our
view,
in
the
rla
this
court
had
determined
in
the
hanson
case
that
since
federal
law
preempted
all
state
law
which
would
limit
union
security
and
had
created
a
federal
scheme
that
each
union
security
provision
was
imbued
with
federal
law
and
was
the
action
of
the
government.
under
this
court's
decisions,
the
most
recent
of
which
is
san
francisco
arts
and
athletics
all
you
have
here
is
a
governmental
permission,
a
permission
no
different
than
the
permission
given
to
the
olympic
committee
there
or
permission
of
the
kind
at
issue
in
jackson
v.
metropolitan
edison
to
in
private
parties
unions
and
employers
to
reach
these
kinds
of
agreements.
thus,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
there
is
any
substantial
constitutional
issue,
and
that
being
so
and
given
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
8(a)(3),
both
parts
of
the
language
of
8(a)(3),
the
second
proviso
which
we've
discussed,
and
the
proviso
saying
notwithstanding
any
other
law,
we
believe
that
this
agreement
which
requires
each
individual
in
the
bargaining
unit
to
pay
the
same
amount
is
indisputably
lawful
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
the
parallel
between
these
statutes,
it
seems
to
me
is
rational
to
say
that
because
under
the
nlra,
you
have
the
right
to
strike,
that
ought
to
be
read
into
public
sector
law
where
it
doesn't
fit,
or
because
you
have
the
secondary
boycott
under
the
rla
without
regard
to
what
congress
did
in
1947,
nlra
unions
ought
to
have
the
right
to
a
secondary
boycott.
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
these
statutes
are
related
to
each
other,
but
they're
not
identical
to
each
other.
second,
the
reference
that
mr.
vieira
makes
to
section
9(a),
the
fact
that
only
a
9(a)
union
can
make
a
union
security
agreement
that's
lawful
under
federal
law
that
isn't
prohibited
by
federal
law
again
is
a
total
red
herring.
that
language
was
in
the
'35
act
at
which
time
unions
had
the
right
to
secure
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
a
closed
shop,
and
you
had
to
be
a
full
member,
you
were
subject,
if
you
were
discharged
by
the
union
for
any
arbitrary
reason,
could
also
be
discharged
from
your
employment.
and
that's
what
congress
wanted
to
stop.
third,
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
it
is
not
the
law
in
this
court
that
everything
an
nlra
union
does
in
negotiating
a
collective
agreement
is
state
action.
if
it
were,
then
webber
would
have
had
to
have
been
decided
the
other
way.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
unions,
like
public
utilities,
like
the
olympic
committee,
are
a
bundle
of
rights
and
powers,
but
insofar
as
the
government
has
no
close
nexus
with
the
private
decisionmaking,
this
state
action
cases
make
it
absolutely
plain
that
the
union
is
a
private
party
and
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
on
street
and
hanson,
let
me
refer
you
back
to
the
materials.
in
hanson,
at
pages
231
and
232
of
351
u.s.,
the
court
said,
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
took
the
view
that
justiciable
questions
under
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
were
presented
since
congress
by
the
union
shop
provision
sought
to
strike
down
inconsistent
laws
in
17
states.
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
said
such
action
on
the
part
of
congress
is
a
necessary
part
of
every
union
shop
contract.
we
agree.
and
then
in
street,
the
portion
of
the
opinion
which
introduces
the
constitutional
element
of
the
case
is
entitled
"the
hanson
decision".
so
the
difference
between
these
two
statutes,
which
we
think
is
determinative
with
regard
to
whether
you
look
at
this
through
a
constitutional
lens
is
the
preemption
of
state
law
in
the
railway
labor
act,
and
the
lack
of
preemption
here.
