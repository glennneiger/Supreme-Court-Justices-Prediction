justice
o'connor
mr.
gold,
what
about
judge
murnaghan's
argument
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
as
regards
these
non-union
members
should
lead
to
the
result
for
which
he
argued.
you
dealt
with
that
only
in
a
footnote,
but
really
didn't
address
the
substance
in
the
brief
of
judge
murnaghan's
position.
justice
o'connor
but
certainly
the
language
very
similar
to
that
in
8(a)(3)
is
found
in
the
railway
labor
act,
and
this
court
has
said
it
just
doesn't
include
collection
of
dues
of
that
kind
against
non-members.
and
i
think
that's
your
biggest
hurdle
to
overcome,
obviously.
