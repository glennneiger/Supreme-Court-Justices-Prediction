chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-637,
communication
workers
of
america
versus
harry
e.
beck.
mr.
gold,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
second
proviso
is
then
a
proviso
to
the
first
proviso,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
vieira.
chief
justice
rehnquist
because
they're
violating
the
equal
protection
clause,
they
are
in
effect
the
government
of
a
government
action?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
now,
but
that
doesn't
make
much
sense
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
to
say
that
whatever
congress
may
have
intended
when
it
passed
this
in
1948,
it's
too
late
for
us
to
do
anything
about
because
we've
already
made
so
many
mistakes
in
the
past.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
vieira.
mr.
gold,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
street
and
hanson?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
