mr.
gold,
is
there
no
ambiguity
there?
would
you
say
that
any
charge
is
made
for
initiation
is
an
initiation
fee
and
any
amount
required
as
dues,
no
matter
what
it
is
devoted
to,
would
come
within
this
provision?
i
mean,
suppose
a
union
decides
that
it's
going
to
provide
retirement
benefits
for
its
membership,
and
it's
going
to
fund
these
not
out
of
payments
from
their
paychecks,
but
it's
going
to
fund
it
out
of
union
dues,
and
this
retirement
is
only
given
to
union
members.
now,
can
the
union
do
that
and
charge
very
very
high
dues
but
the
union
members
are
willing
to
pay
it
because
they
can
get
retirement?
justice
scalia
but
if
that's
what
congress
intended,
it
could
simply
have
said,
instead
of
the
failure
of
the
employee
to
tender
the
periodic
dues
and
the
initiation
fees
uniformly
required,
it
could
have
simply
said
the
failure
of
the
employee
to
tender
any
amount
of
money
uniformly
required
as
a
condition
of
acquiring
or
retaining
membership.
congress
had
to
use
the
words,
dues
and
fees.
justice
scalia
but
they
wouldn't
have
been
uniform
anyway,
so
you
didn't
have
to
use.
justice
scalia
uniformly
required
as
a
condition
of
acquiring?
justice
scalia
but
if
you
eliminated
that
and
put
it
in
the
dues,
it
would
be
okay,
which
the
union
could
do,
i
presume?
justice
scalia
we're
not
going
to
have
any
more
assessments,
we're
just
going
to
raise
the
dues
three
dollars
a
year.
justice
scalia
so
your
answer
to
my
question
is,
no
matter
what
they
use
it
for,
including
retirement
benefits
available
only
to
union
members,
so
long
as
they
do
it
through
dues,
they
can
get
it
from
the
non-union
members.
justice
scalia
no
matter
what?
justice
scalia
annual
party
or
anything
at
all?
justice
scalia
yes?
justice
scalia
retirement
system
funded
out
of
dues.
we
can
decide
that
case
when
it
arises.
you'd
rather
have
the
whole
loaf,
i
understand.
justice
scalia
strange
way
to
say
that,
isn't
it?
i
mean
to
say
dues
and
initiation
fees
if
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
costs
of
collective
bargaining?
justice
scalia
it's
strange
there,
too.
justice
scalia
i
think
he
might
have.
he
might
well
have
said,
it's
the
best
i
could
do.
mr.
gold
is
nodding
his
head.
justice
scalia
mr.
gold's
position
is
that
it's
better
than
what
the
pre-existing
situation
was
where
you
could
be
compelled
to
pay
the
full
dues
and
also
be
compelled
to
be
a
full-fledged
union
member.
justice
scalia
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
and
the
states
can
do
that
under
the
current
law,
if
they
want
to,
can't
they.
whereas
under
the
railway
labor
act,
that
eminently
sensible
disposition
could
not
be
required
by
any
state,
could
it?
unless
the
federal
law
required
it,
nothing
could
require
it.
whereas
here,
it
makes
sense,
as
you
say,
but
the
states
can
do
it,
if
they
want.
justice
scalia
and
that's
a
big
difference
between
this
and
the
railway
labor
act.
justice
scalia
mr.
vieira,
could
you
talk
about
how
practically
feasible
that
is?
the
union
contends
that
it's
a
real
knotty
problem
to
separate
out
from
union
dues
that
portion
that
is
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
function.
that
seems
to
me
to
make
a
lot
of
sense?
this
tends
to
be
a
litigious
field,
anyway,
and
you
can
litigate
from
now'til
doomsday
over
what
particular
portion
of
the
union
dues
goes
to
collective
bargaining.
