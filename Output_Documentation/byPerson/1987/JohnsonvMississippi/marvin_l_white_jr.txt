mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
case
that
we
are
presented
for
resolution
here
today
is
similar
to
that
found
in
smith
v.
murray
that
was
decided
in
1986.
we
have
to
be
considered
here
questions
of
procedural
bar
and
the
questions
of
what
must
occur,
if
anything,
when
one
of
several
aggravating
circumstances
is
found
used
in
support
of
a
death
penalty
is
later
held
invalid,
and
then
we
have
this
twist
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
argument
also
added
to
that
particular
part
of
it.
in
smith,
of
course,
the
procedural
bar
was
relied
on
there,
and
the
court
expressly
declined
to
address
the
question
of
what
the
invalidation
of
one
aggravating
circumstance
of
several
would
affect...
how
that
would
affect
the
outcome
of
a
sentencing
decision
there.
we
think,
though,
that
the
smith
rationale
is
applicable
here,
both
on
the
issue
of
procedural
bar
as
well
as
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
case.
and
just
to
step
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
question
a
minute
in
this
particular
case,
what
we
have
is
a
situation
where
the
mississippi
supreme
court
looked
at
what
new
york
did
and
said
that
it
did
not,
in
effect,
affect
the
judgment
of
the
sentence
of
death
in
this
particular
case.
the
petitioner
amici
here
would
have
the
court
adopt
a
rule
that
it
would
require
an
automatic
reversal
or
vacation
of
a
death
sentence
where
an
aggravating
circumstance
is
later
found
invalid.
this
has
not
occurred
in
the
past
from
this
court.
the
lower
courts
have
held
in
various
cases
that
this
does
not
result
in
an
automatic
reversal;
that
the
court
can
consider
this.
and
even
without
a
harmless
error
analysis
on
this
type
thing,
the
fifth
circuit
in
williams
v.
maggio,
and
knighton
v.
maggio,
they
only
review...
in
louisiana,
only
review
one
of
several
if
there
are
several
found;
they
only
review
one.
they
don't
review
the
others,
so
is
louisiana.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no,
it
has
not.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
they
affirm,
right.
in
this
particular
case,
it
is
our
contention
that
they
did
do
a
proportionality
review
here,
and
say
that
the
death
penalty
was
totally
appropriate
in
this
case
without
considering
the
prior
conviction
in
that
particular
part
of
the
opinion.
they
did
in
the
opinion
say
that
it
was
supported
by
the
record
at
that
time.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
what
i
am
relying
on,
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
they
talk
a
lot
about
what
the
effect
of
the
new
york
vacation
in
that
particular
instance
were,
but
i
think
that
we
get
to
that
point,
and
they
say
it
would
not
affect
that,
and
we
are
relying
on
that
that
they
were
correct
in
that
the
sentence
of
death
would
not
be
disturbed
because
of
the
vacation
of
that
new
york
sentence.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
could
be
resentenced,
a
new
sentencing
proceeding
could
be
contrary
to
the
amicus
brief
of
the
city
bar
of
new
york
who
said
that
it
would
have
to
be
sentence
to
life.
he
could
be
given
a
new
sentencing
hearing
before
a
new
jury
and
a
new
sentence
of
death
could
be
imposed
if
the
jury
saw
fit
to
do
so
at
that
time.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
right.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
those
are
the
thing
we
rely
on.
and
i
would
certainly
agree
that
the
statute,
the
way
the
statute
is
written
the
court
makes
a
finding
of
whether
or
not
the
aggravating
circumstances
are
supported
by
the
record.
and
then
they
make
a
proportionality
review
of
that
case
with
other
cases,
like
cases.
and
in
this
type
thing,
they
sometimes
do
this
reweighing.
i
think
they
are
saying
here
that
these
aggravating
circumstances
here
do...
in
fact,
would
not
change
the
outcome
of
this
thing.
i
don't
think
they--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
in
wainwright
v.
goode,
the
way
i
read
it,
the
court
there
did
not
go
into
an
extensive
reweighing.
it
was
more
or
less
that
they
found
that
it
was
supported
there.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes.
i
mean
they
have
said
in
stringer
v.
state,
and
irving
v.
state.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
they
are
cited
in
my
brief,
i
think
stringer
and
irving
both.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
and
in
the
nixon
opinion
that
is--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--irving.
stringer
v
state,
500--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--and
irving,
498.
and
these
also
go
back
to
tokman.
they
have
held
for
quite
awhile
that
the
invalidity
of
one
aggravating
circumstance
doesn't
vitiate
the
death
sentence
that
they
will--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--they
say--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
they
have
never
said
they
will
not.
in
fact,
in
nixon
they
said
that
in
the
similar
context.
you
know,
if
you
want
to
bring
this
before
us,
you
can
bring
it
before
us,
but
it's
not
going
to
guarantee
you
a
new
sentencing
hearing,
or
even
that
we
are
going
to
vacate
the
death
penalty.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
it
is
something
we
will
consider
at
that
point
to
think,
in
our
opinion
whether
a
new
sentencing
hearing
is
required.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
irving
held
the
same
thing.
it
said
that
they
would
consider
it
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
new
hearing...
but
basically
irving's
holding
is
that
one...
the
invalidation
of
one
aggravating
circumstance
does
not
vacate
a
death
sentence
if
it
is
supported
by
other
valid
circumstances
much
the
way
that
the--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--right.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
from
the
reading
of
zant
and
barclay
and
goode,
the
court
places
great
emphasis
on
the
proportionality
review
separate
from.
they
talk
about
the
invalidity,
the
court
talks
about
the
invalidity
of
an
aggravating
circumstance,
and
then
they
talk
about,
but
we
are
further,
you
know,
feel
safe
about
this,
because
the
courts
have
demonstrated
they
will
set
aside
one
if
it
is
disproportionate.
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
set
aside
cases
finding
the
sentence
disproportionate
to
the
crime
and
to
the
circumstances
in
several
cases,
holding
that
the
crime,
the
punishment
does
not
merit...
i
mean
the
punishment
of
death
is
not
warranted
in
that
case
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
maybe
it
is
in
some
circumstances
here.
i
know
the
fourth
circuit,
in
smith
v.
picunia,
which
is
the
lower
court
case
in
smith
v.
murray,
they
did
not
apply
a
harmless
error
test
or
a
reweighing
type
situation
there
in
that.
and
as
i
said,
the
fifth
circuit
regularly,
out
of
the
cases
out
of
louisiana,
they
only
review
one
aggravating
circumstance
and
don't
even
reach
the
others,
whether
they
are
invalid
or
not,
to
determine
whether
or
not
relief
could
be
granted
on
one
of
these
others.
they
only
review
one.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
they
did,
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes.
well--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
it's
like
the
situation
in
smith
v.
picunia,
or
smith
v.
murray,
and
your
dissent
in
that
case
where
there
was
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
a
procedural
bar
case,
but
your
dissent,
of
course,
said
the
procedural
bar
should
not
be
applied,
and
that
the
fifth
amendment
violation
relating
to
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
should
vitiated
the
whole...
the
death
penalty
and
a
new
sentencing
hearing
was
conducted.
i
am
well
aware
of
that
precedent,
or
that
dissent.
and
going
back
somewhat
to
justice
scalia's
question
earlier
about
the...
i
think
was
dealing
with
the
pardon
situation
here.
what
is
in
effect
here
has
been
a
judicial
pardon.
there
has
been
no
finding
that...
by
new
york
that
he
was
actually
innocent
of
this
1963
crime,
but
that
because
of
the
passage
of
time
that
it's
impossible
to
retry
him
or
give
him
an
out-of-time
appeal.
and
in
the
words
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
that
this
is
the
case
and
he
had
appealable
issues
with
possible
merit.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
under
the
facts
of
the
case,
you
introduce
the
certified
copies
from
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
right.
that
can
be--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--that
has
been.
but
you
can
challenge
that
as
the
time
even
though,
you
know,
the
validity
of
that
at
the
time
and
show
that
it
in
fact
is
not
there.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
in
the
phillips
case,
of
course,
dealt
with
a
habitual
offender
statute
type
situation
where
we
had...
and
as
the
court
distinguished
it
here,
our
supreme
court
distinguished
the
use
of
phillips
in
this
type
case
and--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
relying
on
the
bar
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
applied
in
this
case,
that
one
found
in
evans
v.
state,
he
should
have
raised
it
as
the
soonest
possible
moment
he
could
have
after
the
conviction
or
beforehand.
but
from
the
time
he
was
convicted
and
until
the
time
he
presented
this
to
a
court
was
four
years.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
he
could
have.
i
mean
it
would
not
have
been--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--in
phillips,
and
as
it
is
now
interpreted
in
nixon,
he
did
what
the
supreme
court
now
has
said
he
should
have
done.
he
raised
it
post-trial.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
for
the
failure
to
do
it
speedily
after
that
time.
now
i
agree
with
you
the
procedural
bar
question
here
is
problematic.
and
the
phillips
case,
and
as
i
have
said
in
my
brief,
i
did
not
argue
procedural
bar
before
the
court
below.
but
procedural
bar
is
one
of
the
court's
sua
sponte
imposition.
i
think
i
have
to
argue
it
here,
because
the
court
found
that
procedural
bar.
but
they
did
also
go
on
and
address
it
alternatively.
and
so
the
procedural
bar
question
is
one
that
is
important,
but
i
don't
think
in
this
particular
case
it
is
necessarily
the
most
important
procedural
bar
we
have
in
this
context.
i
think
our
argument,
our
strongest
argument
is
that
the
context
of
aggravating
circumstances
in
mississippi
is
different
than
it
is
in
georgia
or
louisiana
where
you
have
the
aggravating
circumstances
not
being
constitutionally
required.
the
mississippi
statute
is
just
like...
for
all
practical
purposes...
like
the
statute
in
louisiana
in
which
this
court
earlier
in
lowenfield
v.
phelps
held
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
are
not
constitutionally
required
in
the
narrowing
process
to
whether
not
the
person
is
going
to
receive
the
death
sentence.
so
i
think
that
looking
at
it
in
that
context
the
aggravating
circumstances
serve
a
state
law
purpose
here,
and
not
a
constitutional
purpose,
because
under
lowenfield
the
finding
of
guilty
of
a
murder
of
a
policeman
in
this
case
was
adequate
to
impose
the
death
penalty
without
the
consideration
of
aggravating
circumstances
in
mississippi
as
it
was
in
louisiana,
and
this
was
not
part
of
the
constitutional
required
narrowing
process.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
it
says,
though,
that
it's
not
required.
the
aggravating
circumstances
are
a
matter
of
state
law
there,
and
i
think
we
have
to
make
that
argument
that
the
state
law
ground
of
that,
and
our
court
interpreted
that
that
not
to
require
reversal
in
this
case.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
agree,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
it
did.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
but
we
would
basically
rely,
though,
on
the
proportionality
review
there
in
the
readings
of
zant
and
barclay
and
goode
in
that
when
this
proportionality
review
is
made,
even
in
light
of
an
invalidated
aggravated
circumstances
or
invalid
circumstance,
that
this
review
that
the
invalidation
of
this
aggravating
circumstance
here
does
not
make
the
penalty
arbitrary,
or
freakish,
or
capricious,
nor
is
it
excessive
or
disproportionate
in
this
case.
and
the
narrowing
done
by
the
jury
there
i
think
was
sufficient,
and
the
other
two
aggravating
circumstances
relied
on,
and
as
found
by
the
supreme
court,
would
certainly
outweigh
this
later
invalidated--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--it
could
be.
if
let
us
say
in
an
enhanced
sentencing
situation
under
the
habitual
offender
statute
all
you
have
to
prove
is
the
existence
of
the
prior.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
you
have
to
prove
two,
or
sometimes
the
prosecutor
will
go
and
prove
three,
and
this
is
before
the
judge
only.
upon
the
proof
of
two,
he
is
eligible
to
be
sentenced
to
life
without
parole,
or
the
maximum
sentence
without
parole,
depending
upon
which
statute
you
are
under.
there
you
don't
have
this
process
as
the
court
below
pointed
out,
this
process
of
the
jury
then
looking
at
all
of
the
factors
here.
just
on
the
proof
of
that
prior
conviction
he
is
entitled...
the
judge
is
entitled
to
impose
the
maximum
sentence,
whether
it
be
the
maximum
number
of
years
or
life.
so
you
have
a
greater
involvement
in
that
case
of
the,
or
play
of
the
use
of
a
prior
conviction.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
it
wouldn't
go
back
to
the
trial
judge.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
the
procedure
in
mississippi,
of
course,
is
that
once
something
is
appealed
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
it
goes
back
to
that
court
for
an
application
to
proceed
in
a
lower
court.
and
so
the
supreme
court,
just
as
in
this
particular
case
here,
this
did
not
go
back
to
a
trial
court
for
a
hearing.
this
was
considered
en
banc
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
and
without
sending
it
back
for
a
hearing
before
the
lower
court.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
in
that
case
he
would
be...
the
sentence
would
be
reduced.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
it
would
be
reduced.
there
would
not
be
a
chance
under
that
situation
because
they
have
applied.
our
court...
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--i
don't
know
that.
i
mean
we
haven't
had
that
presented
in
this
case.
both
in
phillips
and
in
nixon,
the
issue
of
the
invalidity
of
the
sentence
was
raised
on
direct
appeal.
and
both
phillips
and
nixon
are
direct
appeal
cases.
they
are
not
post-conviction
cases
where
the
court
said,
we're
not
going
to
consider
it
here
on
this
direct
appeal.
you
have
raised
the
validity
on
direct
appeal,
but
we're
not
going
to...
you
know,
you
go
and
tell
us.
and
in
fact,
in
phillips
on
the
direct
appeal,
he
had
already
filed
in
petition
in
kentucky
and
had
the
sentence
set
aside
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal.
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
reinstated
the
convictions,
and
so
the
court
said,
we're
not
going
to
fool
with
this
on
direct
appeal.
get
it
all
straightened
out,
and
then
bring
it
back
to
us.
and
this
is
basically
what
they
have
said
in
nixon,
but
with
the
admonition
that
just
because
it's
vacated
doesn't
mean
that
we're
going
to
vacate
the
death
sentence
that
was
based
in
part
on
that.
even
in
the
situation
here,
the
dissent
below
says
that
they
would
invalidate
this
under
state
law
grounds
and
not
under
federal
law
grounds.
so
we
feel
that
the
analysis
here
can
be
made
without
having
to
make
a
harmless
error
analysis,
and
that
the
court
below
was
correct
in
its
judgment.
thank
you.
