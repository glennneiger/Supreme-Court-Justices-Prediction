chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
abrams,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
wish
to.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
was
the
basis
of
the
reversal
of
the
conviction,
mr.
abrams,
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no
right
to
appeal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
just
didn't
give
him
a
late
appeal
then.
chief
justice
rehnquist
isn't
the
burden
normally
on
an
appellant
in
new
york
to
show
error?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
they
ordinarily...
but
they
would
pass
on
those
claims,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
they
do
not
make
any
judgment
on
the
merits
as
to
whether
the
conviction
was
infected
with
error.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
was
as
far
as
they
went
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
your
position
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
has
a
negative
operation;
that
a
second
state
cannot
give
a
judgment
any
more
faith
and
credit
than
it
has
given
in
the
state
that
it
originated.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
case
from
this
court--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--then
what's
the
basis
of
your
argument
then?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
we
have
cases
in
our
jurisprudence
that
say
even
though
the
state
was
not
required
by
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
to
give
effect
to
a
particular
judgment,
it
could
do
so
unless
there
is
a
due
process
context
relation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
case
in
this
court
comes
closest
to
supporting
your
proposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
case
in
mind
that
supports
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
dealing
with
the
federal
court
of
appeals,
we're
dealing
with
federal
convictions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00,
mr.
abrams.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
where
we
were
before
lunch,
mr.
abrams.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
abrams.
we
will
hear
now
form
you,
mr.
white.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
white.
mr.
abrams,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
abrams.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-5468,
johnson
against
mississippi
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
