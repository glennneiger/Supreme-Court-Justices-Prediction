justice
stevens
general
white,
isn't
there
involved
in
this
case
still
another
problem
though?
suppose
this
conviction
in
new
york
had
been
set
aside
before
the
sentencing
hearing.
would
you
not
agree
that
it
would
have
been
improper
to
put
the
trial
court
conviction
before
the
sentencing
jury?
justice
stevens
it
would
be
improper.
justice
stevens
so
here
if
you
say
that
we
didn't
know
at
the
time,
the
jury
did
consider
evidence
that
we
now
know
it
should
not
have
considered.
justice
stevens
so
these
other
cases
where
you
invalidate
an
aggravating
circumstance
usually
the
evidence
supporting
the
circumstance
is
properly
before
the
jury,
and
the
question
really
is
whether
it
was
entitled
to
have
the
label
aggravating
circumstance
attached
to
it.
justice
stevens
but
this
is
a
little
different,
i
think.
justice
stevens
of
course,
that
was
a
procedural
bar
case
rather
than--
justice
stevens
would
you
clear
up
one
thing
for
me?
i
kind
of
got
myself
mixed
up
in
this
argument.
if
this
instead
of
being
a
capital
case
had
been
a
habitual
offender
case,
and
you
had
the
same
sequence
of
events
that
you
had
here,
would
the
sentence...
the
enhanced
sentence
be
reduced
in
mississippi?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
if
it
were
set
aside
in
the
same
time
sequence
that
we
had
here,
normally
the
trial
judge
would
take
a
second
look
at
the
sentence
then.
justice
stevens
or
would
it
automatically
be
reduced--
justice
stevens
--i'm
still
not
clear
on...
had
this
not
been
a
capital
case
and
been
an
enhance
sentencing
case,
and
you
had
the
same
sequence
of
events,
say
one
of
the
two
prior
convictions
was
set
side
as
this
one
was
after
the
sentencing,
would
there
be
a
new
sentencing
either
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
or
by
the
trial
court?
justice
stevens
it
would
be
reduced.
justice
stevens
there
would
be
no
mississippi
procedural
bar
to
a
reduction
of
the
sentence
in
this
same
time
sequence.
that's
what
i
am
trying
to
get
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
a
capital
case
that
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
a
petitioner
was
convicted
of
murder
and
sentenced
to
death
largely
that
in
the
sentencing
hearing
great
emphasis
was
placed
on
the
fact
that
he
had
previously
been
convicted
of
a
felony
in
new
york
and
that
substantiated
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
to
justify
the
death
sentence.
however,
after
he
had
been
sentenced,
the
new
york
conviction
was
reversed
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
the
question
then
arose
as
to
whether
the
death
sentence
could
stand
when
it
was
impart
based
on
a
factual
conviction
that
was
no
longer
valid.
and
in
the
unanimous
judgment
today,
we
reverse
the
holding
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
