justice
o'connor
mr.
abrams.
justice
o'connor
was
that
full
faith
and
credit
argument
made
to
the
mississippi
court
below?
justice
o'connor
--well,
mr.
white,
what
does
mississippi
rely
on
in
these
aggravating
circumstances?
or
at
least
what
did
it
rely
on
here?
did
it
rely
on
the
prior
conviction
in
new
york
without
going
into
the
facts
and
so
forth?
justice
o'connor
and
that's
it,
just
the
conviction.
justice
o'connor
and
that
has
now
been
set
aside.
justice
o'connor
what
do
you
assert
that
the
petitioner
should
have
done
in
this
case
to
raise
his
constitutional
challenge
in
light
of
your
phillips
case
and
nixon
case
in
mississippi?
justice
o'connor
well,
my
question
to
you
is,
what
do
you
say
this
petitioner
should
have
done
here
to
put
his
claim
before
the
courts?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
don't
think
i
understand.
you
say
that
on
direct
appeal
he
should
have
raised
this
claim?
justice
o'connor
i'm
asking
what
he
should
have
done
in
order
to
enable
the
mississippi
courts
to
address
the
problem
that
has
arisen.
justice
o'connor
well,
then
how
could
he
be
procedurally
barred?
