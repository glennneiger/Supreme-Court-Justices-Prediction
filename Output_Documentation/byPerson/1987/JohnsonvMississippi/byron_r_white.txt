justice
white
mr.
abrams,
there
was
no
holding
in
new
york
that
failure
to
give
him
an
appeal
denied
him
a
constitutional
right.
justice
white
do
you
think
in
effect
it
was
a
holding
that
his
conviction
was
unconstitutional,
or
that
the
constitution
required
the
setting
aside
of
his
conviction?
justice
white
well,
is
there
some
other
constitutional
reason
based
on...
reason
based
on
the
federal
constitution
why
this
conviction
could
not
be
used
in
this
sentencing
proceeding?
justice
white
would
you
think
you
have
a
better
chance
of
winning
on
full
faith
and
credit
than
the
due
process?
justice
white
well,
at
least
you've
got
some
cases
in
this
court.
justice
white
but
you
have
no
cases
on
full
faith
and
credit.
justice
white
has
mississippi
in
the
past,
when
they
find
one
of
several
aggravating
circumstances
invalid,
normally
remand
it
for
a
new
trial?
justice
white
so
the
appellate
court
does
the
reweighing
itself?
justice
white
and
if
it
finds
that
the
valid
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances,
they
affirm?
justice
white
but
they
say,
"even
if
we
conceded
that
the
jury
had
no
authority
to
consider
this
conviction,
the
remaining
to
aggravating
circumstances
were
sufficient
to
support
the
jury's
verdict.
"
is
that
what
you
rely
on?
justice
white
you
don't
think
they
took
that
back
a
couple
of
pages
later?
it's
hard
to
tell.
justice
white
--before
this
one
where
it's
clear
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
does
reweigh,
where
they
have
expressly
said,
we
do
not...
when
one
of
several
aggravating
circumstances
is
invalidated,
we
do
not
necessarily
send
it
back
for
a
new
sentencing
hearing,
we
will
reweigh?
justice
white
stringer
v.
state,
and
irving.
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
so
it
is
stringer,
and
the
other
one
was
what,
irving?
justice
white
yes,
i've
got
it.
justice
white
and
doesn't
necessarily
vitiate
it,
but
will...
but
do
they
say,
we
will
not
send
back
for
a
new
sentencing
hearing?
justice
white
we
will
reweigh,
and
we
find
the--
justice
white
--yes?
justice
white
well,
what
did
irving
hold?
justice
white
--competent
constitutionally
to
reweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances
against
the
mitigating
and
affirm?
justice
white
well,
that's
your
reading
of
this
opinion.
justice
white
well,
how
about
my
question
now?
justice
white
what
constitutional
provision
would
be
violated?
justice
white
i'm
not
taking
about
proportionality.
