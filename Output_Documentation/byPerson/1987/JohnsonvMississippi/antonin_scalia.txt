justice
scalia
mr.
abrams,
that
means
that
another
state
cannot
take
it
into
account
for
any
purpose?
justice
scalia
by
reason
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
justice
scalia
what
if
the
governor
had
pardoned--
justice
scalia
--not
if
you
are
relying
on
full
faith
and
credit.
justice
scalia
let's
assume
it
does.
let's
assume
new
york
is
a
state
in
which
a
pardon
wipes
out
the
conviction.
do
you
think
mississippi
cannot
constitutionally
rely
on
the
conviction
anymore
as
an
indication
of
the
character
and
the
blame
worthiness
of
this
individual
simply
because
the
governor
of
new
york
has
decided
to
give
a
pardon?
justice
scalia
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
the
same.
if
you
are
relying
on
full
faith
and
credit,
wouldn't
the
pardon
be
fully
as
effective,
assuming
the
pardon
wipes
out
the
conviction
for
purposes
of
state
law?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
there
is
one
thing...
there
is
a
difference
between
giving
a
decision
of
another
state
full
faith
and
credit
in
the
sense
that
it
has
an
operative
legal
effect.
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
another
to
say
that
the
jurors
of
mississippi
cannot
be
allowed
in
evaluating
the
character
of
this
individual
to
take
into
account
that
he
has
been
convicted
by
a
new
york
jury
of
having
committed
a
serious
crime
regardless
of
whether
the
governor
later
chose
to
pardon
him.
that's
not
giving
it
any
legal
effect.
it's
just
using
it
as
a
means
of
determining
what
the
man's
character
is.
justice
scalia
may
i
ask,
mr.
abrams,
are
you
asking
that
we
give
more
than
the
required
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
earlier
conviction?
i'm
sorry.
are
you
saying
you
cannot
give
more
than
the
required
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
earlier
conviction?
or
rather,
are
you
saying
you
must
give
the
required
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
second
action
of
the
new
york
courts;
namely,
the
setting
aside
of
that
conviction.
i'm
saying
at
least
in
the
circumstance
in
which
you
have
given
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
first,
you
must
give
it
to
the
second.
mississippi--
--so
it's
really
the
second
action,
it's
the
second
action
that
you
focus
on.
justice
scalia
mr.
abrams,
you
said
that
the
new
york
state's
attorney
vigorously
contested
the
relitigation
of
this
and
refused
to
accept
anything
but
the
resentencing.
now
after
the
resentencing,
was
there
opposition
to
the
setting
aside
of
the
sentence?
justice
scalia
so
this
was
a
genuinely
litigated
matter
in
new
york
from
beginning
to
end.
justice
scalia
adversely
litigated.
justice
scalia
mr.
white,
what's
the
language
you
rely
upon
to
say
that
the
mississippi
court
actually
did
a
reweighing?
it
seems
to
me
proportionality
review
is
not
the
same
as
reweighing.
it
just
means,
you
know,
this
jury
verdict
is
in
accord
with
the
run
of
the
mind
jury
verdict.
justice
scalia
nor
is
the
other
statement
you
rely
on
actually
a
redoing
of
the
weighing
by
the
supreme
court.
it's
just
saying
even
without
this,
there
would
be
enough
to
support
the
jury
verdict.
that's
not
the
same
as
saying,
you
know,
if
we
had
to
call
ourselves,
we'd
call
it
that
way.
what
language
in
the
opinion
leads
you
to
believe
that
they
did
the
reweighing
here?
justice
scalia
wouldn't
they
say
it
would
support
an
unchanged
outcome?
they
say
it
would
support
an
unchanged
outcome.
that
is,
the
jury
could
reasonably
not
have
changed
the
outcome.
justice
scalia
but
that's
a
bit
different
from
reweighing
it
themselves
and
saying,
well,
you
know,
the
jury
goofed
up
through
no
fault
of
their
own
because
there
was
inadmissible
evidence.
we'll
have
to
reweigh
it
ourselves,
and
our
call
is
thus
and
such.
they
didn't
really
say
that.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
very
good,
but
i
mean
that's
just
what
we
are
arguing
about
here.
justice
scalia
the
issue
is
it's
clear
that
it
doesn't
invalidate
it
if
the
court
is
reweighing
in
light
of
that
invalidation
itself.
but
it
seems
to
me
circular
to
simply
argue
since
the
court
said
it
doesn't
automatically
set
it
aside,
the
court
must
be
reweighing
it
itself.
the
court
might
have
just
been
taking
the
erroneous
view,
or
at
least
what
mr.
abrams
would
say
is
erroneous,
that
it
doesn't
have
to
reweigh;
that
proportionality
review
is
enough.
would
you
assert
the
proportionality
view
is
enough
without
reweighing
assuming
that--
justice
scalia
--is
that
really
fair
to
the
defendant
though?
the
jury
was
entitled,
if
it
wanted
to
give
him
a
disproportionately
lenient
sentence,
wasn't
it?
and
he's
been
deprived
of
that
opportunity.
it's
one
thing
to
say
we'll
have
the
supreme
court
reweigh
it,
but
the
jury
might
have
decided
to
give
him
a
disproportionately
light
sentence
for
one
reason
or
another
had
it
not
been
considering
this
improper
factor.
and
you're
saying,
well,
that's
too
bad.
so
long
as
it
is
proportionate
on
appeal,
we'll
uphold
it,
and
we
won't
even
have
the
supreme
court
redo
the
weighing.
that's
quite
a
different
approach.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
is
interpreting
its
statute
not
to
require
reweighing.
justice
scalia
but
lowenfield
did
not
involve
a
situation
in
which
the
defendant's
claim
is
the
jury...
he
could
not
possibly
have
said
the
jury
wouldn't
have
reached
the
result
it
did,
and
that's
the
situation
here.
there
is
a
plausible
claim
that
this
jury
wouldn't
have
given
this
man
the
death
sentence
had
that
evidence
been
excluded.
justice
scalia
now
that
situation
didn't
exist
in
lowenfield.
justice
scalia
all
the
stuff
that
went
before
the
jury
was
directly
before
them,
and
they
made
the
decision
on
the
basis
of
all
of
that.
so,
you
know,
i
don't
find
lowenfield
terribly
persuasive
on
the
precise
point
here.
justice
scalia
are
you
saying
they
are
not
constitutionally
required
by
the
federal
constitution?
justice
scalia
well,
let's
take
the
normal
criminal
trial.
let's
say
a
certain
crime
is
defined
to
require,
i
don't
know,
putting
three
bullets
in
the
individual,
and
that's
certainly
not
required
that
you
define
the
crime
to
have
that
element.
but
nonetheless,
if
that
element
is
not
proven,
we
wouldn't
uphold
a
conviction
and
simply
saying,
well,
it
wasn't
federally
required
that
you
have
that
element.
justice
scalia
here
the
state
didn't
have
to
require
the
jury
to
find
all
this,
but
it
did.
justice
scalia
and
we
don't
know
that
the
jury
actually
found
it,
or
properly
found
it.
