mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
appeal
arises
out
of
the
reliance
by
the
state
of
mississippi
in
the
sentencing
phase
in
a
capital
murder
case
of
the
trial
of
samuel
johnson,
of
a
1963
new
york
conviction
for
assault
in
the
second
degree
that
has
since
been
reversed
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
and
is
thus
under
new
york
law,
a
nullity.
the
1963
new
york
conviction
was
referred
to
22
times
by
the
prosecutor
during
the
sentencing
phase
of
the
trial,
and
was
emphasized
by
the
prosecution
as
a
prime
basis
for
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
specifically
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
no
right
to
appeal
provided
to
sam
johnson
in
new
york.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
it
was
a
few
things
which
came
together.
specifically
and
indisputably
in
terms
of
the
state
of
new
york,
he
had
never
been
advised
that
he
had
a
right
to
appeal
in
new
york.
he
sought
to
appeal
in
new
york
on
three
separate
occasions,
the
court
of
appeals
observed,
after
his
time
had
expired,
after
he
learned
and
tried
pro
se
to
appeal.
he
was
not
provided
with
counsel,
appellate
counsel
that
represented
him
competently
in
new
york,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
commented
on
that.
and
he
had
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
described
as
claims
of
possible
merit
on
the
merits
of
what
would
have
been
his
appeal
in
new
york.
all
this
time
having
passed,
however,
and
having
passed
because
of
the
fault
of
new
york,
not
sam
johnson
who
had
tried
to
appeal
thrice
during
this
period,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
that
had
been
entered
against
mr.
johnson.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
what
they
said
in
effect
is
that
there
is
not
enough
left
to
talk
about
here.
what
happened,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
this.
the
lower
court
in
this
case
had
resentenced
mr.
johnson
so
that
he
could
appeal.
that
was
what
the
new
york
state
authorities
had
urged;
simply
a
resentencing.
we
had
urged
in
the
lower
courts
in
new
york
vacation
of
the
judgment.
we
lost
on
that
at
the
state
supreme
court
level.
we
lost
on
that
at
the
appellate
division
level.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said,
in
substance,
it
isn't
enough
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
to
hear
on
this
appeal.
there
are
no
records
left
to
examine
on
this
appeal.
there
is
no
point
in
having
a
huntley
hearing,
for
example.
mr.
floyd
abrams
not
in
a
situation,
your
honor,
where
he
was
denied
a
jackson
hearing.
on
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession,
for
example,
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
show
that
it
was
voluntary.
now
in
this
case
we
came
forward
with
affidavits
from
trial
counsel,
from
mr.
johnson
himself,
from
the
state
legal
defender's
office
that
was
supposed
to
but
did
not
represent
him
when
they
were
assigned
to
represent
him
on
the
appeal,
all
of
which
taken
together
persuaded
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
that
not
only
had
johnson
been
denied
a
right
to
appeal,
but
that
he
had
serious
claims
which
he
could
have
made.
mr.
floyd
abrams
ordinarily
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
done
in
the
past
in
the
rivera
case,
the
montgomery
case
where
a
lot
of
time
has
passed
and
it
has
passed
because
of
the
action
of
the
state,
only
if
it
has
passed
because
of
state
misconduct
so
to
speak
as
opposed
to
defendant
misconduct,
what
they
have
routinely
done
in
new
york
in
those
cases
is
to
dismiss
and
to
reverse
the
state
conviction.
mr.
floyd
abrams
in
the
earlier
rivera
case,
they
made
no
decision
on
the
merits
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
conviction.
in
this
case,
the
court,
having
read
the
affidavits,
said
that
there
were
claims,
serious
claims
of
possible
merit
which
mr.
johnson
had.
those
claims
were
the
ones
that
i
adverted
to
earlier.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
on
the
merits
as
far
as
they
went
was
to
say
that
there
were
serious
claims
of
possible
merit.
those
claims
were
claims
relating
to
the
use
of
a
coerced
confession
and
the
like
against
him
in
his
1963
trial
and
related
matters.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
conviction
is
a
nullity
under
new
york
law.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
believe
so,
justice
scalia.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
there
i
think
it's
a
somewhat
harder
issue
because
what
the
pardon
means--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--no,
i
think
it
depends
on
what
a
pardon
means
in
the
state.
there
are
a
lot
of
states
in
which
a
pardon
does
not
wipe
out
the
conviction
but--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--again,
i
would
distinguish
between
a
pardon
issued
by
the
executive
of
the
state
and
a
judicial
determination.
the
answer
might
be
the
same
under
full
faith
and
credit
if
the
effect
in
the
state
where
the
pardon
was
issued
is
that
he
has
no
record
at
all
and
it
is
as
if
he
had
done
nothing
at
all.
if
that's
so--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--so
long
as
you
ask
me
to
assume
i'm
in
a
state--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--in
which
a
pardon
wipes
it
out
completely.
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
a
pardon
wipes
it
out
completely,
then
i
would
be
urging
upon
you
that
a
pardon
under
full
faith
and
credit
ought
to
be
given
the
same
effect
as
if
it
was
a
judicial
decree.
now
as
to
whether
that
argument
would
persuade
as
to
whether
a
pardon
is
close
enough,
exact
enough
fit
to
a
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
i
think
it
probably
should
be
if
you
are
in
a
state
in
which
the
pardon
completely
eliminates
the
prior
conviction.
i
can't
tell
you
that
that
would--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--this
was
given
legal
effect
in
mississippi.
this
was
the
only
basis
for
the
aggravating
circumstance,
the
only
one
for
the
aggravating
circumstance
most
relied
upon
by
the
prosecutor.
under
mississippi
law
one
potential
aggravating
circumstance
in
a
capital
offence
which
can
lead
to
execution
is
if
you
have
a
prior
criminal
record
of
a
felony.
so
we're
not
talking
here
about
the
question
of
whether--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
it
does.
so
we're
not
talking
here
about
whether
there
is
some
possible
way
that
a
jury
could
have
learned
about
it
in
some
context.
it
might
be,
for
example,
that
on
cross-examination
of
mr.
johnson,
if
he
had
testified,
that
the
rules
might
be
somewhat
different.
but
this
was
used
as
the
evidence
of
an
aggravating
factor,
and
it
is
evidence
which
could
not
be
admitted
in
new
york,
could
not
be
taken
account
of
by
a
new
york
court
because
it
is
a
nullity.
now
if
i'm
wrong
about
it
being
a
nullity,
that
would
be
one
thing.
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
on
that.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
correct.
mr.
floyd
abrams
this
court
has
not
held
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
basis
of
the
argument
is
this.
mississippi
adhered,
took
advantage
of,
so
to
speak,
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
they
gave
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
new
york
conviction.
they
were
entitled
to
do
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
by
federal
statute.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
is
not
my
argument,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
mississippi
is
obliged
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
criminal
convictions
from
out
of
state.
they
could
if
they
choose
certainly
constitutionally
have
a
system
where
they
have
no
aggravating
circumstance,
for
example,
for
convictions
out
of
state.
having
taken
account
of,
having
given
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
new
york
conviction,
it
is
our
position
that
they
must
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
new
york
reversal.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
this
court
has
talked
in
terms
of
states
not
being
able
to
pick
and
choose
between
giving
full
faith
and
credit
sometimes
and
sometimes
not
giving
full
faith
and
credit.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
will
give
you
that
name
right
after
lunch,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
want
to
make
clear,
i
am
not
urging
on
this
court
that
there
is
a
body
in
this
court's
law
of
full
faith
and
credit
law
which
is
exactly
on
point
in
terms
of
this
case.
what
this
court
has
done
and
done
with
some
frequency
in
three
separate
cases
is
to
deal
with
the
question
of
what
happens
in
a
situation
in
which
a
jury
that
is
engaged
in
the
sentencing
process
or
a
judge
in
fact
receives
materially
false
information,
or
receives
information
in
the
u.s.
v.
tucker
case
which
is
false
about
the
validity
of
a
prior
sentence.
that's
not
full
faith
and
credit.
i'm
not
urging
upon
you
that
it
is.
but
i
do
want
to
start
out
by
saying
that
this
court
has
had
those
cases
in
the
past,
that
all
12
court
of
appeals
in
this
country
have
had
cases
and
have
routinely,
all
of
them,
held
that
resentencing
should
be
required
in
situations
in
which
juries
receive
information
about
sentences
which
subsequently
have
been
reversed.
now
all
those
are
not
cases
involving
states
doing
one
thing
and
then
changing
their
policies.
those
aren't
full
faith
and
credit
cases.
but
i
start
with
the
proposition
that
what
we
are
urging
upon
you
here
in
terms
of
resentencing
has
been
the
most
ordinary,
usual,
repeated
action
of
state
courts
around
the
country.
to
our
knowledge,
we
don't
know
of
any
case
in
which
a
state
court
has
not
resentenced
in
a
situation
after
a
conviction
that
was
relied
upon
has
been
reversed.
and
every
federal
court
of
appeals
in
one
way
or
another
has
done
that.
now,
our
first
argument
is--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
sir,
yes.
i'm
sorry,
in
a
few
cases
state,
but
mainly
the
federal
convictions,
often
uncounseled
convictions
or
otherwise
inappropriate
invalid,
the
courts
have
said,
for
one
reason
or
another.
our
first
argument
to
you
is
a
full
faith
and
credit
argument,
and
it's
based
upon
the
proposition
that
when
a
state
in
the
first
instance
affords
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
judgment
of
another
state,
it
is
obliged
not
to
stop.
it
is
obliged
not
simply
to
take
account
of
the
conviction
and
not
the
reversal.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
it
was.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
yes,
the
reversal.
if
mississippi
had
not
in
the
first
instance
admitted
into
evidence
the
conviction,
then
there
would
be
a
question,
i
suppose,
as
to
whether
they
had
to
take,
on
grounds
of
relevance,
the
reversal
of
the
conviction.
but
having
taken
the
conviction,
we
think
they
have
to
take
the
reversal.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
if
it
is
relevant,
we
would
think
they
would
have
to.
and
under
the
federal
statute,
in
fact,
i
think...
i
mean
i
have
no
doubt
that
under
the
federal
statute
that
they
could
not
argue
that
it
was
not
sufficiently
proved
for
purposes
of
admissibility.
as
to
whether
it's
relevant,
i
suppose
there
could
be
a
case
in
which
a
prior
reversal
of
an
unadmitted
conviction
was
not
relevant
from
the
point
of
view
of
even
a
sentencing
if
the
first
conviction
had
not
gone
to
the
jury.
i
think
it's
worth
starting
with
what
time
i
have
left
at
this
point
in
my
argument
with
why
new
york
became
involved
in
this
case.
i
mean,
it
is
a
little
bit
unusual
to
have
a
situation
in
which
you
have
a
new
york
court
of
appeals
decision
in
a
mississippi
murder
case,
a
brief
from
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
a
death
case
that
comes
from
mississippi.
it
all
came
about
because
of
mississippi
case
law.
the
phillips
case
in
mississippi,
phillips
v.
state
holds,
and
i
think
holds
clearly
that
there
is
only
one
option
for
a
defendant
in
mississippi
against
whom
the
state
wishes
to
use
in
one
fashion
or
another
an
out-of-state
conviction.
he
has
to
go
back
to
that
state.
that
is
not
a
majority
rule
in
this
country.
it's
perfectly
constitutional.
it's
entirely
consistent
with
principles
of
federalism
for
mississippi
to
say,
as
they
have,
we
don't
want
to
have
separate
hearings
here,
separate
trials
here
on
already
tried
cases.
go
back
to
where
your
conviction
occurred.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
was
done
here,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
but
so
far
as
we
know,
mr.
johnson
is
the
only
one
ever
to
be
able
to
do
this
since
mississippi
made
clear
that
that
was
the
law.
and
so
we
went
to
new
york,
which
is
where
in
effect
mississippi
law
sent
us.
and
in
an
adversary
proceeding
in
new
york,
in
which
we
were
opposed
at
every
step
of
the
way
by
the
new
york
attorney
general's
office,
except
on
the
issue,
the
fact
issue
of
whether
mr.
johnson
had
been
advised
of
his
right
to
appeal
in
1963
as
to
which
the
attorney
general's
office,
doing
its
job
and
adhering
to
ethical
principles
of
the
bar,
checked
it
out
and
found
out
that
he
had
not,
and
so
advised
the
court.
they
opposed
any
other
relief
that
we
sought
save
resentencing
of
mr.
johnson.
now
there
is
a
suggestion
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
in
this
case
that
the
phillips
case
does
not
apply
in
a
capital
murder
case
because
it
arose
in
the
context
of
habitual
offender
sentencing.
that
is
surely
not
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
phillips
case.
and
if
it
ever
was
even
arguable,
it
is
now
no
longer
arguable
because
in
the
recent
nixon
case
we
cite
in
our
brief,
a
november
1987
case
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
they
make
very
clear
that
they
do
apply
it
in
capital
cases.
it
is
not
applied
in
sam
johnson's
case,
but
it
is
applied
in
the
case
of
mr.
nixon,
who
was
another
person
on
death
row
in
mississippi.
now
we
urge
upon
you
that
that
is
simply
not
a
permissible
way
for
a
state
to
behave.
the
phillips
case
was
a
case
we
were
entitled
to
rely
upon.
it
told
us
what
to
do,
and
we
went
and
did
it,
and
we
went
to
new
york,
and
we
got
the
very
reversal
that
as
it
were
the
phillips
case
told
us,
demanded
that
we
get
in
new
york,
and
we
went
back
to
mississippi
and
we
urged,
as
a
part
of
post-conviction
relief
that
we
were
seeking
in
mississippi,
that
based
on
full
faith
and
credit
principles,
that
the
new
york
decision
should
be
given
effect,
and
that
resentencing
should
occur.
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court
responded
by
saying,
among
other
things,
that
they
would
not
give
effect
to
it
because
of
the
"extremely
likelihood"
that
if
they
were
so
dependent
on
out-of-state
highest
courts
to
make
decisions
impacting
on
their
sentencing
procedures,
that
they
could
have
sureness
in
the
sentencing
policy.
with
all
respect,
they
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
they
cannot
send
us
to
new
york,
and
then
when
we
obtain
the
holy
grail
in
new
york
and
bring
it
back
and
present
it
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court
tell
us
that
that's
not
enough.
in
fact,
it
is
as
if
they
were
insulted
by
the
fact
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
done
that.
mr.
floyd
abrams
indeed,
indeed.
and
as
the
dissenters
pointed
out,
if
this
had
been
raised
earlier
in
mississippi,
we
presumably
would
have
been
told,
pursuant
to
phillips,
we
don't
have
it.
and
then
if
we
ever
got
what
we
went
to
new
york
to
obtain,
that
it
was
res
judicata
because
it
had
been
argued
before.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
new
york
attorney
general's
office
opposed
setting
aside
of
the
sentence.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
it
was
genuinely
litigated.
now
i
want
to
say
again--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--so
as
not
to
mislead
the
court,
that
the
new
york
attorney
general's
office,
in
my
view,
in
the
highest
tradition
of
the
bar,
advised
every
court
that
it
appeared
before
in
new
york
that
they
had
investigated
and
that
sam
johnson
had
not
in
fact
been
advised
of
his
right
to
appeal,
and
that
therefore
resentencing
was
appropriate
under
the
circumstances,
and
then
that
an
appeal
should
follow.
but
beyond
that,
they
did
not
agree
with
our
position
as
to
what
should
occur
as
a
result.
now
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
having
ruled
as
it
did,
as
this
court
is
aware,
the
state
of
new
york
has
now
filed
a
brief
with
this
court
urging
that
as
a
matter
of
full
faith
and
credit
law,
and
in
part
citing
a
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
is
far
more
on
point
than
anything
that
this
court
has
said
in
so
many
words,
that
the
same
full
faith
and
credit
should
be
given
in
new
york
as
new
york
gives
to
other
states'
rulings.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
new
york
state
court
cited
new
york
cases,
yes.
the
new
york
cases
are
bottomed
themselves
on
some
cases
of
this
court,
well
known
to
this
court.
mr.
floyd
abrams
in
response
to
the
first
part
of
your
question,
mr.
justice
white,
they
did
not
say
that
this
conviction
was
unconstitutional
under
federal
law.
it
was
unconstitutional
under
new
york
law
at
least.
under
federal
law,
though,
at
the
least
if
he
didn't
get
a
huntly
hearing
in
new
york,
huntly
is
our
effort
to
comply
with
jackson
v.
denno,
and
he
didn't
get
that
sort
of
hearing.
he
is
constitutionally
entitled
under
the
law
of
this
court
as
well
as
the
law
of
new
york
to
that
sort
of
hearing.
so
the
ruling
in
new
york
then
is
bottomed
on
new
york
cases
which
in
part
are
bottomed
on
federal
cases.
for
example,
he
had
no
effect
of
representation
in
his
appeal.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
that.
no
effective
representation
because
although--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--thank
you.
mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
were
two
reasons
relied
upon
primarily
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
denying
post-conviction
relief;
one
procedural,
one
substantive.
i
will
advert
briefly
to
each.
procedurally,
the
thrust
of
the
mississippi
opinion
was
that
the
issues
considered
here
and
argued
by
me
today
were
not
raised
before
the
mississippi
supreme
court
on
direct
appeal
in
the
action,
but
only
on
post-conviction...
only
at
the
post-conviction
stage.
there
are
answers
in
our
brief.
i
would
rest
at
this
point
in
this
oral
argument
on
the
phillips
case
itself.
we
had
nothing
to
say
on
direct
appeal.
we
had
been
told
by
the
phillips
case
that
what
we
were
to
do
was
to
go
to
new
york,
if
a
new
york
conviction
it
was.
that
was
what
we
did,
and
it
was
proper
to
do
so.
we
abided
by
the
procedural
rules
in
effect
at
the
time
in
mississippi
in
all
respects.
substantively,
i
have
been
thinking
about
my
not
too
persuasive
answer
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
terms
of
citing
cases
from
this
court
involving
full
faith
and
credit
which
are
wholly
applicable
to
the
situation
here.
most
of
the
cases
that
we
rely
upon
in
our
brief
which
are
close
are
state
cases.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
states
have,
in
our
view,
abided
by
their
obligations
under
full
faith
and
credit,
and
have
therefore
written
the
basic
opinions
dealing
with
the
scope
of
the
clause
in
this
area.
we
cited
the
new
york
case,
the
fairland
dairies
case,
a
california
case,
oklahoma
case.
we
think
those
cases
are
correct
in
their
interpretation
of
federal
law.
the
closest
cases
from
this
court
are
close
only
because
they
set
down
general
principles
about
full
faith
and
credit:
millikan
v.
meyer,
wisconsin
v.
pelican,
old
cases,
pelican
in
particular,
in
terms
of
the
theory
of
full
faith
and
credit.
there
is
nothing
contrary
to
those
state
cases
that
we
cite
in
terms
of
its
articulation
of
full
faith
and
credit
law.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
the
other
reason
is
a
due
process
reason
that
this
court
has
in
the
burgett
case,
in
the
tucker
case,
in
the
townsend
case,
come
down
hard
on
lower
courts,
state
and
federal,
in
which
you
have
used--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
thought
so
coming
in,
but--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
do
have
cases
in
this
court
on
that.
it
seemed
to
me
that
those
three
cases
are...
those
three
cases
of
this
court
are
right
on
point
insofar
as
misleading
or
prejudicial
evidence,
particularly
evidence
with
respect
to
reversed
convictions.
mr.
floyd
abrams
on
full
faith
and
credit,
in
terms
of
reversed
criminal
convictions,
no.
it
did
seem
to
us
that
full
faith
and
credit,
and
it
still
seems
to
us,
a
more
serious
argument.
but
those
three
cases
are
due
process
cases
which
i
cite
to
you.
mr.
floyd
abrams
they
were
enhancement
cases,
yes,
yes,
and
they
were
cases
in
which
information
which
came
before
state
and
federal
courts
was
later
stricken
because
it
turned
out
to
be
wrong
just
as
hear.
finally,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
it
could
be
said
that
was
is
involved
here
is
harmless
error.
whatever
the
scope
of
that
doctrine
in
the
sentencing
field,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
itself
explicitly
assumed
any
finding
of
harmless
error
in
this
case.
we
think
this
is
not
a
case,
in
any
event,
in
which
harmless
error
could
play
a
role
given
the
degree
of
emphasis
placed
by
the
prosecutor
on
this
single
prior
felony
conviction.
but
this
is
not
a
harmless
error
case
in
the
sort
that
this
court
has
sometimes
considered.
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
is
not
our
position
in
this
case
that
there
should
be
an
automatic
reversal
when
an
aggravating
circumstance
is
held
invalid.
this
court
has
dealt
with
that
question.
our
position
here
is
that
when
bad
evidence
comes
before
a
jury,
misleading
evidence,
prejudicial
evidence,
evidence
which
counsel,
general
white
now
concedes
could
not
have
come
before
the
jury
had
the
reversal
occurred
earlier,
that
that
is
the
circumstance
in
which
the
death
penalty
cannot
be
upheld
because
it
cannot
be
said
that
it
would
have
occurred
but
for
the
bad
evidence.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
would
say,
first
of
all,
that
is
not
what
the
court
did
in
this
case
as
a
constitutional
matter.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir,
it
is
my
reading
of
this
opinion
on
two
separate
basis.
first
of
all--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--right.
yes,
it
would
be,
my
answer
to
your
question
directly,
that
that
sort
of
reweighing
in
this
circumstance,
in
a
situation
in
which
a
jury
had
free
rein
to
determine
how
much
to
weigh
mitigating
circumstances
against
aggravating
circumstances,
and
the
jury
is
instructed,
as
in
this
case,
that
it
could
weigh
in
effect
the
mitigating
circumstances
as
much
as
they
wanted
the
aggravating.
that
in
that
sort
of
situation
where
the
jury
did
that,
that
it
would
raise
very
serious
constitutional
issues
for
the
state
supreme
court
to
engage
in
the
reweighing.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
believe
the
eighth
amendment
would
be
violated.
now
this
court
has
not
addressed
that
issue
yet,
because
it
hasn't
had
to
address
that
issue
yet.
but
in
a
situation...
i
mean
we
have
a
situation
here
where
the
scope
of
review
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
is
not
one
which
asks
anything
more
than
whether
a
jury
could
have
done
that.
i
mean
the
court
is
not
substituting
its
views
for
that,
or
affirming
the
views
of
the
jury
in
mississippi.
it
is
addressing
a
much
narrower
issue.
in
mississippi
v.
caldwell,
the
sort
of
language
used
in
justice
o'connor's
opinion,
for
example,
was
was
it
so
arbitrary
that
it
was
against
the
overwhelming
weight
of
the
evidence.
i
mean
that's
the
role
of
the
jury
in
mississippi.
for
the
state
supreme
court
then
to
engage
in
the
first
instance
in
a
weighing
process
where
it
has
not
heard
any
of
the
evidence
and
cannot
assess
the
in-court
evidence,
i
would
argue
to
you,
if
that
was
before
you,
is
barred
by
the
eighth
amendment.
but
i
would
urge
upon
you
that
that
question
is
not
before
you.
there
was
no
reweighing
here.
the
proportionality
review,
for
example,
was
at
the
time
of
the
direct
appeal.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir.
right.
and
i
would
just
urge
upon
you
that
it
is
my
reading,
at
least,
that
they
did
not
engage
in
that
and
could
not.
so
in
the
end
then,
we
would
urge
upon
you
that
this
situation
is
the
question
reserved
by
the
court
in
zant.
it
is
not
zant,
or
barclay,
or
lowenfield.
if
this
were
lowenfield
and
this
sort
of
information
had
come
before
the
jury,
we
might
well
make
the
same
argument
to
you.
i
mean
if
this
were
the
lowenfield
case
itself
and
the
jury
in
that
case
had
heard
evidence
pressed
by
counsel
of
a
reversed
conviction,
we
would
be
urging
upon
you
that
in
that
type
of
situation
you
should
reverse,
and
that's
what
we
urge
upon
you
today.
thank
you.
