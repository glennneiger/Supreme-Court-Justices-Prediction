the
major
implication
is
that
they're
just
not
trustworthy.
justice

--the
government
pays
them
the
money,
and
they
just
forget
to
pay
their
lawyer.
justice

well,
i
know,
but
so
your
basic
contention
is
that
you
really
can't
rely
on
your
client
to
pay
you
when
he
gets
the
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that
may
be,
but
what...
i
suppose
if
the
statute
expressly
said
just
plain
out
that
no
mailing
of
fees
to
lawyers,
you
would
just
have
to
put
up
with
it.

so
if
we
decide
against
you,
as
you
say,
it'll
be
just
like
the
statute
said
it.
justice
byron

then
you'll
have
a
choice
of
staying
in

getting
out.

mr.
bartels,
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
should
be
made
across
the
street.
justice

you're
not
happy--
--why
don't
you
think
title
xvi
forbids
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
legislative...
the
legislative
history
sort
of
indicates
they
didn't
expect
to
permit
the
administration
to
do
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
lawyers
who
just
represent
other
lawyers,
and
because
they're
specialists
in
fee
litigation?
