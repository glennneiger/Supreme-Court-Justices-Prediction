mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
chief
justice
and
members
of
this
court,
we
have
in
this
country
a
wonderful
social
security
disability
system.
there
is
one
brief
flaw
in
it
right
now,
and
that
is
how
the
poor
people
are
going
to
come
about
paying
their
attorneys.
if
these
people
can't
pay
attorneys,
lawyers
aren't
going
to
take
their
cases.
they
have
the
right
to
present
a
social
security
claim,
but
if
they
don't
have
a
lawyer
to
help
them
appeal
it,
they
can't
get
there.
now,
the
whole
issue
is
legal
representation.
and
i'd
submit
to
you
that
most
of
these
people
out
there
who
i
represent,
they're
the
poor,
the
illiterate,
the
downtrodden.
they
don't
know
what
it
is
to
even
carry
a
credit
card,
a
kerr-mcgee
gas
credit
card
or
american
express
or
anything.
they're
poor.
but
they
live
from
day
to
day,
from
mouth
to
mouth.
if
these
people
can't
get
a
lawyer
to
help
them,
they
don't
live
in
one
town
long
enough
to
get
their
social
security
claim
with
the
local
social
security
office.
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
it's
the
lawyers
who
help
them
get
their
claims
filed,
even
if
the
people--
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
--no,
your
honor,
not
trustworthy.
we're--
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
--they
move
a
lot.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
well,
judge,
i've
had
it
happen
to
me
a
few
times.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
i
would
have
to
submit
that,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
i've
had
it
happen
to
me
where
people
have
gotten
their
money,
died,
they
didn't...
they're
res
pendent,
so
there's
no
estate
to
file
a
claim
with;
or
i've
had
them
get
their
ssi
money,
spend
it,
i
sue
them
to
get
my
money,
they
take
bankruptcy,
and
i
get
a
notice
from
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
that
ends
my
claim
there.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
yes,
that's
true,
when
we
settle
automobile
tort
claims,
if
you're
in
that
area
of
the
law.
and
of
course,
the
social
security
law
is
a
regulated
law,
attorney
fee
areas.
that
is
to
say,
there
are
a
lot
of
attorneys
who
won't
take
a
social
security
case
because,
hey,
there's
nobody
out
there
going
to
tell
me
what
i
can
charge
these
guys
for
my
services.
they
don't
want
some
bureaucratic
agency
dictating
the
amount
of
their
fee.
and
of
course,
you
have
problems
like
that.
this...
there
is
a
bureaucracy
problem
with
your
attorney's
fee,
whether
it's
an
ssi
or
a
title
ii,
and
whether
it's
at
the
administrative
level.
if
you
win
a
case
at
the
administrative
level,
and
you're
not
happy
with
your
attorney's
fee,
you
can
appeal
it
one
step.
but
there's
no
judicial
review
of
that,
and
the
social
security
administration
right
now
is
reducing
all
requested
fees.
and
of
course,
when
you
get
it
into
court,
you
can
file
for
an
eaja
fee.
and
you
probably
are
asking
yourselves
why
i
didn't
file
an
eaja
fee
petition
and
then
file
my
other
fee
petition,
you
see,
because
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
law,
an
attorney
is
supposed
to
file
that
eaja
first.
he's
supposed
to
do
that,
and
i
know
that,
and
i
know
it
in
this
case
here.
but
i
couldn't
raise
that
issue
if
i
had
filed
eaja
and
the
judge
would
have
granted
my
eaja
petition.
then
i
would
not
have
had
this
claim
to
present
to
the
court.
that
would
have
ended.
so
i
just
went
ahead
and
filed
a
claim
for
my
one
fourth
of
past
due
benefits,
based
on
an
hourly
rate.
and--
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
--you
don't
have
to
show
that,
your
honor,
and
also
i
have
a
lot
of
other
title
xvi
cases
whose
fees
i
know
i'll
get
if
i
get
this
court
to
approve
that.
that's
the
reason,
your
honor.
now,
i
had
a
case
recently,
an
ssi
case
recently,
where
a
man,
after
seven
years
of
litigation,
he
died.
that
was
an
ssi
case.
they
hadn't
made
the
award
yet.
had
they
made
the
award,
i...
and
paid
him,
i
could
have
maybe
gotten
my
money
from
him.
but
i
had...
i
went
ahead,
when
i
discovered
his
death,
and
no
payment
made
by
the
social
security
administration
under
title
xvi,
i
immediately
filed
an
eaja
fee
petition
to
get
paid
for
what
i
did
in
the
federal
court
level.
i
won't
get
anything
at
the
administrative
level;
i
got
about
$1200
off
that
case,
working
with
that
older,
alcoholic
tramp
for
seven
years.
that's
what
my...
i
really
made
off
that
case.
now,
so
i
filed
an
eaja
real
quick
in
that
one.
so
you
see,
if
the
client
dies
before
the
money
comes,
you
don't
get
anything.
that's
the
law.
and
i
daresay
about
50
percent
of
the
people
i
represent
and
get
on
social
security
are
dead
within
three
years.
i
have
the...
i
can
definitely
tell
you
that.
most
people
don't
last
very
long,
where
they
are
sick,
disabled.
and
you
don't
go
into
federal
court
and
try
to
get
a
substantial
evidence
case
overturned
without
having
a
good
case.
you'll
go
broke
practicing
law
doing
that
out
there.
now,
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
more
about
the
social
security
administration's
attitude
about
attorney's
fees;
that
is
to
say,
first,
they
deny
the
people;
the
people
get
in
a
lawyer
who
gets
them
on.
then
they
say,
well,
now
you
got
the
money
coming,
we're
going
to
regulate
the
fees.
and
a
thing
or
two
they
do,
and
i've
showed
it
in
one
of
my
briefs,
maybe
miscalculate
the
benefits,
you
submit
your
fee
petition
based
on
that
benefits
they've
submitted.
then
six
months
later
you
find
out
they
made
a
mistake.
they
write
back
and
say,
the
client,
we
made
a
mistake,
we
undercalculated
by
6000,
we're
mailing
a
check,
client
directly,
$6000.
you
don't
get
any
of
it,
we're
sorry,
we
made
a
mistake.
i've
had
that
happen
to
me,
and
i
attached
two
more
in
my
briefs,
a
case
where
that
has
happened
before,
too.
what
i'm
saying
is,
the
administration,
the
social
security
administration,
is
taking
a
very
hard
attitude
towards
attorneys
getting
paid.
and
if
you'll
read
books
on
the
subject
by
mr.
francis
or
mr.
mccormick,
who
i'm
sure
you're
all
acquainted
with
those
books,
point
out
that
problem
you
have
in
collecting
your
fees.
and
that
just
drives
the
lawyers
out
of
the
social
security
legal
representation
business.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
or
else
get
out
of
the
business.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
and
you
see,
if
the
lawyers
get
out
of
the
business,
then
those
people
don't
have
legal
representation,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
it's
going
to
be...
the
statute
hasn't
really
made
it--
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
--your
honor,
the
statute
that
they
talked
about
was
at
the
administrative
level.
they
didn't
talk
about
the
court
level.
the
statutes
they're
talking
about,
and
the
most
recent
case
on
this
point,
the,
as
you
all
know,
the
circuits
are
split.
the
first...
on
this
issue
of
whether
they
should
withhold.
the
reid
case
came
down
in
'84.
they
said
the
court
had
the
power
to
do...
to
order
the
social
security
administration
to
withhold.
at
that
point,
shortly
after,
and
this
is
referred
to
in
the
most
recent
case
on
the
point,
which
went
against
my
point
of
law,
this,
the
howard
case,
there's
a
footnote,
and
the
judge
pointed
out
that
the
house
committee
apparently
believed
that
attorney's
fees
could
be
awarded
out
of
ssi
benefits,
see
house...
see
the...
he
cited
the
congressional
code
it
comes
from.
and,
of
course,
that
was
the
only
case
on
point.
congress
just
thought
they
had
it
after
they
had
a
meeting
over
there.
and
i
daresay
a
lot
of
our
legislators
are
lawyers,
the
two
us
senators,
my
congressman,
are
all
lawyers.
i
knew
them
back
when
they
were
down
in
the
pits,
fighting
and
making
a
living.
but
now
they're
on
capitol
hill.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
yes,
sir.
i
was
by
their
offices
yesterday
and
didn't
find
any
of
them.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
well,
judge,
there
are
arguments--
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
--sure.
now,
judge,
let
me...
because,
you
know,
when
this
legislation
comes
down,
the
social
security
administration
has
their
representatives
there
at
that
hearing,
too.
and
they
politick,
and
they
saw
where
congress
was
missing
the
point
here,
and
didn't
rule
on
it.
they
stayed
silent,
congress
had
to
adjourn,
the
boys
had
to
go
back
to
their
home
fields
to
run
for
office.
and,
of
course,
well,
social
security
says,
we'll
cover
that
with
a
regulation.
and
i've
attached
a
copy
of
their
regulation,
most
recent
regulation
at
this
point,
after
the
galbreath
case
came
down.
they
wanted
to
come
up
with
another
regulation
to
make
sure
they
covered
it.
it
said
in
there,
we
do
not...
and
i've
supplied
it
to
the
court
already...
we
do
not
pay
money
directly
to
those
attorneys;
we
just
don't
do
it.
even
if
you
got
a
court
order,
you
don't
do
it.
and
sometimes
you
have
a
court
order
to
collect
the
title
to
fee,
and
you...
it's
just
pretty
hard
to
get
the
government
in
contempt
to
get
that
check
out.
those
are
some
of
the
things
you
run
into
in
the
practice
of
law.
but
the
circuits
are
split.
the
first
circuit
says
no,
the
government
doesn't
have
the...
have
to
pay
the
checks,
because
the
court
doesn't
have
the
inherent
authority.
the
third
circuit's
the
reid
case.
motley
vs.
heckler
says
yes,
they
do.
galbreath
vs.
bowen
says
yes.
and
the
mccarthy
and
howard
out
of
the
sixth
and
seventh
circuits
say
to
the
contrary.
now,
when
they
first
passed
this
social
legislation
for
disability
back
in
the
early
'40s,
they
forgot
to
put
in
there
whether
the
court
could
order
it
to
be
withheld.
and
it
took
a
court
decision
back
then,
which
our
counsel
referred
to
earlier...
it
was
the
court
decision
of
celebrezze
vs.
sparks,
which
came
down
on
march
16th
of
'65,
and
that
case
held
that
court
did
have
the
inherent
authority
to
order
those
payments
made
out
of
title
ii
benefits.
then,
later...
now
that
decision
was
in
march
of
'65...
then
in
may,
april
and
may
of
'65,
social
security
administration
lobbyists
did
appear
before
a
senate
committee
and
said
yes,
we
think
it's
all
right
to
go
ahead
and
do
that,
but
there
should
be
a
cap
on
the
lawyer
fees.
so
they
came
up
with
the
25
percent
cap
on
past
due
benefits.
now,
that's
great
if
you
won
every
social
security
case
you
took.
but
you
take
10
cases
out
there,
and
you
got
to
be
pretty
good
sometimes
to
figure
out,
pick
the
winners,
because
you
pick
a
lot
of
losers,
you're
going
to
go
broke
practicing
law
now,
and
we
all
know
that.
that's...
but
you
take
10
cases.
you
lose
three
of
them,
you
don't
get
paid
for
it.
so
there's
no
past
due
benefits
to
take
any
fee
out
of.
you
got
seven
you
win,
so...
and
of
course,
if
you
hit
a
big
fee
on
social
security
cases,
you
don't
automatically
get
one
fourth
of
the
past
due
benefits.
that's
just
the
amount
the
government
holds
back.
you
have
to
submit
an
hourly
fee
petition,
and
then
they
take
a
look
at
the
hours
you
worked.
suppose
a
guy
came
in,
all
you
had
to
do
was
interview
him,
write
for
three
or
four
medical
reports,
submit
them
to
social
security,
get
them
in.
you
got
him,
say,
22,000
in
back
pay.
you
might
get
an
attorney
fee
of
$550,
based
on
that
hourly
rate.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
yes.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
yes.
the
government
sent
a
check.
that
surprised
me.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
no,
no,
your
honor,
but
see,
like
this
is
one
case;
it'll
affect,
oh,
many,
many...
you
don't
realize
how
big
this
social
security
system
is
out
there.
and
like
i
say,
it's
a
wonderful
thing.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
i'm
going
to
have
to
eat
them,
as
they
say.
but
i
get
to
bring
my
wife
and
children,
two
of
my
children,
with
me
to
washington.
[laughter]
now,
your
honor,
i
want
to
tell
you,
too,
the...
you
know,
we
talk
about
politics.
here's
how
things
are
done
over
on
capitol
hill,
and,
you
know,
i
knew
some
of
those
guys
over
there.
like
i
say,
i
was
a
claim
adjuster
against
them
on
some
points.
we
helped
them
work
for
reelection
on
things.
you
go
over
there
when
they're
having
those
social
security
hearings
and
you'll
find
out
how
social
security
people
politick.
but
the
government's
justice
department's
also
a
little
bit
of
a
sharp
politician,
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
here's
why
i
say
that.
they
lost
some
cases
on
this
point
in
different
circuits,
but
they
didn't
appeal
them.
now,
they
know,
they
kind
of
gauge
those
circuits
out
there.
we
know
where
our
strength
is
in
the
first
circuit,
we
know
what
the
ninth
circuit'll
do
on
this
point.
and
i
do
wish
mr.
kennedy
would
be
here,
because
i
did
have
a
case
before
him
on
a
three-judge
panel
about
a
year
ago
this
time,
and
he
ruled
against
me
on
a
substantial
evidence
test.
and
like
i
say,
that's
a
hard
one
to
overcome
as
a
plaintiff
lawyer.
but
you
got
to...
you
know,
to
win
a
social
security
case
and
overcome
that
substantial
evidence
test,
you
got
to
have
a
winner.
and
i
really
didn't
have
too
good
a
winner.
but
on
this
case,
he
didn't,
you
know,
bump.
the
woman
had
been,
from
the
time
she
applied,
about
a
year
later
she'd
been
involved
in
a
very
severe
automobile
accident
and
almost
ground
up
to
hamburger.
then
they
set
the
hearing
again,
or
the
onset
date
at
a
different
time.
and
so,
but
you
have
to...
the
government
hasn't
always
picked
the
cases
they've
lost;
they
just
don't
try
them
in,
say,
that
circuit.
and
of
course,
the
fact
that
the
law
of
the
sixth
circuit's
one
way
is
not
res
judicata
in
the
eighth,
as
i've
had
to
find
out
the
hard
way.
see,
like
in
submitting
fee
petitions,
okay,
you
do
some
work
at
administrative
level,
you
have
to
submit
it
at
the
administrative
level
for
what
you
do
there.
they
make
a
finding
on
your
fee.
they
always
reduce
it
a
little
bit.
you
can
appeal
it
one
step,
but
there's
no
court
review
of
it.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
the
congress
just
overlooked
it.
they
have
an
oversight
committee
over
there
who
later
on
goes
and
tries
to
straighten
things
out,
but
they
just
overlooked
it.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
well,
they
were
talking
about
the
administrative
level
fees.
that
was,
if
you'll
read
the
cases,
your
honor,
of...
i'll
read
you
the
most
recent
case
that
was
adverse
to
my
point
of
law,
the
howard
case.
and
at
page
187,
the
court
states
that
the
social
security
administration,
they
used
the
term...
oh,
with
respect
to
representation
before
the
administration.
it's
in
the
first
paragraph.
see,
they've
talked
about
your
representation
at
the
administrative
level.
they
even
had
that;
they
didn't
talk
about
what
happens
if
it
gets
to
court.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
well,
i
don't
know
if--
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
--that's
right.
what
i'm
saying
is,
your
honor,
when
title
ii
was
enacted,
they
didn't
have
anything
in
there
about
withholding
for
attorney's
fees.
there
was
the
court's
decision
of
celebrezze
vs.
sparks
that
held
the
courts
had
the
inherent
power
to
do
this.
then
later
on,
they
have
some
social
security
hearings
later
on,
says
yes,
we'll
go
along
with
that,
but
we
put
a
cap
on
it
of
25
percent.
that's
the
most
a
lawyer
can
get.
but
i
submit
to
you,
the
25
percent
isn't
always
what
you'll
get.
you'll
get
a
lot
less,
and
that's
assuming
you
win
the
case.
you
have
a
lot
of
cases
out
there
you
lose.
that's
just
part
of
your
office
overhead.
then
you
have
cases
where
you
do
win
and
you
get
a
big
back
pay
award
for
the
client,
but,
because
of
the
hourly
rate
scheme,
you
don't
get
anything.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
yes,
and
the
government
immunity
was
still
the
law,
too,
then.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
give
the
money
back?
well,
you
see,
my
client...
i'll
have
to
give
the
money
back
to
the
government,
and
i'll
try
to
have
to
get
my
money
from
the
client.
yes--
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
--well,
i
tell
you
what,
a
lot
of
lawyers
will
think
about
bankruptcy
who
do
social
security
work
if
they
don't
get
paid.
but
we
are
dealing,
gentlemen,
about
a
large
issue
here.
and
i
talk
to
a
lot
of
lawyers,
and
a
lot
of
lawyers
will
tell
me,
i
wouldn't
handle
a
social
security
case
for
anything.
and
i
look
at
them
and
say,
well...
then
i
find,
in
talking
to
them,
i
find
out
they're
really
not
up
on
what
the
social
security
law
is.
there's
big
money
on...
in
it;
unquestionably
there's
big
money
on
it.
now
that
lawyers
can
advertise,
although
i've
never
advertised,
i
got
a
large
social
security
business,
probably
have
350
cases
pending
in
federal
court
right
now
on
various
issues,
issues
like
under
the
eaja,
they
don't
want
to
allow
us
to
get
paid
for
our
billing
time,
they
don't
want
to
let
us
get
paid
for
advance
costs,
like
for
photocopying,
telephone
calls.
i
have
that
pending
before
the
eighth
circuit
in
a
case
of
payton
vs.
bowen.
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
all
fee
litigation,
judge.
i
see
where
they're
cutting
down
on
lawyers
every
day,
see.
and
then,
of
course,
once
they
award
the
fee--
mr.
anthony
w.
bartels
--listen,
they
may
have
to,
judge.
it's
going
to
have
to...
i
tell
you,
it
could
come
to
that.
see,
this
is
the
point
now
that
i
have
before
the
eighth
circuit.
you
see,
it
takes...
you
take
a
case...
this
case
here
is
one
of
my
shorter-lived
cases;
it's
only
about
five,
six
years
old
in
my
office.
i've
had
cases
that,
like
with
the
alcoholic
man
who
died,
on
title
xvi,
that
case
had
drug
on
for
seven
years.
i
got,
you
know,
just
for
one
case
sometimes,
you'll
have
a
file
this
thick.
and
then
they
want
you
to
compute
your
billing
time,
and
you
go
back
through
there
and
compute
that
billing
time,
it
may
take
six,
seven
hours
to
get
all
the
billing
time
in
on
that
case.
and
they
don't
want
to
pay
you
for
that,
but
yet
you
got
to
submit
the
billing
time,
and
they
want
you
to
get
paid
by
the
hour
rather
than
by
the
25
percent
contingency
fee
contract.
so,
gentlemen,
i
don't
want
to
take
any
more
time.
i'm...
i
just...
i've
had
a
chance
to...
and,
believe
me,
i'm
very
grateful
for
having
this
chance
to
come
before
you
to
tell
you
my
side
of
the
story.
thank
you.
