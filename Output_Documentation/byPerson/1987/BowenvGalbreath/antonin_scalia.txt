justice
antonin
scalia
--is
your
argument
that
title
iv
repeals
whatever
pre-existing
inherent
authority
would
have
existed
in
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
xvi,
i'm
sorry,
xvi,
you
would
say,
repeals--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
concede
the
authority
of
the
courts
to
do
it
in
an
ordinary
case
where
there
hasn't
been
any
prohibition
by
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
claim
is
more
valuable
to
you
than
an
eaja
claim
because
you
don't
have
to
show
for
this
one
that
the
government's
position
was
not
substantially
justified
in
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
the
provision
in
title
ii
was
not
adopted
in
order
to
permit
fees
to
be
withheld,
but
rather
in
order
to
put
a
cap
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
fees
that
had
already
been
declared
by
the
courts
to
be
withholdable?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
title
ii
have
an
assignment
restriction?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
did
at
the
time
celebrezze
was
decided,
too?
