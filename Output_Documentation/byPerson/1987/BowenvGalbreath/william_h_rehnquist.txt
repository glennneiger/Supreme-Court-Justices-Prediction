mr.
lazarus,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazarus.
mr.
bartels,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
mr.
bartels,
i
guess
it
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
not
peculiar
to
your
clients,
either,
is
it?
most
lawyers
who
get
a
judgment
and
get
a
payment
and
satisfaction
have
it
made
out
to
a
lawyer
and
the
client
both.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bartels.
mr.
lazarus,
do
you
have
something
more?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazarus.
the
case
is
submitted.
