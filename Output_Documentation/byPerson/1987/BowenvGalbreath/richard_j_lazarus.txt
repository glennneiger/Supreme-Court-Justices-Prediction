mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
thus
case
presents
a
straightforward
question
of
statutory
construction,
whether
a
court
may
order
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
to
withhold
a
portion
of
past
due
benefits
owed
a
financially
needy
claimant
under
title
xvi
of
the
social
security
act
and
pay
those
benefits
directly
to
the
claimant's
attorney
as
an
attorney's
fee.
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
has
concluded
that
the
court
is
without
such
authority
under
title
xvi.
the
language
of
title
xvi
and
its
legislative
history,
we
believe,
prove
the
reasonableness
of
that
construction.
for
this
reason,
we
believe
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
the
pertinent
facts
of
the
case
can
be
very
briefly
stated.
in
may
1982,
respondent
mary
alice
galbreath
applied
for
supplemental
security
income
disability
benefits,
or
ssi,
under
title
xvi
of
the
social
security
act.
that
program
provides
supplemental
security
income
to
financially
needy
persons
who
are
aged,
blind,
and
disabled.
the
agency,
hhs,
denied
her
application,
both
initially
and
following
internal
administrative
appeal
on
the
ground
that
she
was
not
disabled.
her
financial
need
was
uncontested.
in
august
1983,
ms.
galbreath,
represented
by
her
counsel,
brought
this
action
in
federal
district
court
challenging
the
agency's
determination.
in
february
1985
the
district
court
reversed
the
agency
on
the
ground
that
ms.
galbreath
was
in
fact
disabled.
the
court
accordingly
remanded
the
case
to
the
agency
with
instruction
that
it
calculate
and
pay
to
ms.
galbreath
the
amount
of
past
due
benefits
owed
to
her.
on
july
23rd,
1985,
the
agency
accordingly
sent
her
a
check
for
approximately
$8000.
one
week
later,
her
counsel
filed
with
the
district
court
a
motion
for
an
attorney's
fee
award
out
of
her
past
due
benefits.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion,
relying
on
a
provision
of
title
ii
of
the
social
security
act,
section
406,
and
ordered
the
court
to
pay
mr.
bartels,
counsel,
25
percent
of
his
client's
past
due
benefits,
or
approximately
$2000.
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
order,
but
on
a
different
ground.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
courts
possess
inherent
authority
to
order
the
secretary
to
withhold
a
portion
of
ms.
galbreath's
benefits
and
pay
those
benefits
to
her
counsel.
it
is
from
that
judgment
that
we
sought
this
court's
review.
in
our
view,
congress
deny
courts
the
authority,
in
title
xvi,
to
order
the
secretary
to
revert
to
a
claimant's
attorney
a
portion
of
the
claimant's
ssi
benefits.
congress's
plain
intent
is
evident
from
the
statutory
language
and
from
the
legislative
history.
indeed,
the
latter
shows
that
congress
specifically
considered
the
possibility
of
granting
courts
authority
to
order
withholding
and
declined
to
do
so.
congress
determined
that
withholding
would
be
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
the
ssi
program,
which
is
to
provide
benefits
to
the
financially
needy.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
the
title...
well,
it's
title
ii,
it's
title
ii
and
title
xvi.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
once
congress
entered
the
field
and
there
was
legislation,
then
whatever
inherent
authority
courts
had...
and
even
the
celebrezze
decision,
which
is
the
one
decision
to
adopt
that,
in
1965,
said
it
was
in
the
absence
of
a
statute.
and
at
this
point
we
have
a
statute,
we
have
specific,
we
believe,
congressional
intent
not
to
allow
attorney's
fee
withholding.
and
it
is
that
congressional
intent
we
rely
on.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
there
are
several
prohibitions,
and
there
is
also...
here
we
have
the
united
states
as
a
party.
i
wouldn't
concede
it
with
respect
to
the
united
states
being
party.
there
is
some
common
law
precedent
far
back
there
in
england,
starting
with
the
decision
by
lord
mansfield
in
1779,
called
welsh
v.
hull,
which
endorses
the
notion
that
courts
do
have
inherent
authority
to
split
a
judgment
and
ensure
the
attorney's
fee.
but
it's
always,
even
at
common
law,
it's
always
been
in
the
absence
of
a
statute,
and
the
courts
have
noted
that.
and
they
have
never
been
in
cases
involving
the
government.
and
in
here
what
we
have
is
we
have
the
government,
we
have
a
statute,
we
have
an
anti-assignment
prohibition
in
the
statute
which
we
believe
is
explicit,
and
that's
the
first
thing
we
rely
on
in
title
xvi,
which
congress
lifted
with
respect
to
attorney's
fee
withholding
in
title
ii.
we
don't
concede
that
celebrezze
decision
was
right
at
the
time.
the
first
point
is
that
the
language
of
title
xvi
is
explicit.
it
bars
the
transfer
or
assignment
of
any
individual's
right
to
payment
of
ssi
benefits.
the
purpose
of
the
anti-assignment
provision
in
title
xvi
is
to
ensure
that
the
benefits
go
to
those
who
congress
wanted
them
to
go,
the
needy
claimant,
to
provide
for
their
basic
subsistence
needs.
there
is
no
exception
made
in
title
xvi
for
attorney's
fees.
in
contrast,
in
title
ii
of
the
social
security
act,
which
provides
old
age,
survivor,
and
disability
benefits
to
insured
individuals
who
need
not
be
financially
needy,
there
is
express
authority
in
the
statute
authorizing
withholding.
section
406(a)
of
title
ii
authorizes
the
secretary
to
withhold
a
portion
of
a
claimant's
past
due
benefits
as
an
attorney's
fee
upon
making
a
determination
favorable
to
the
claimant
in
administrative
proceedings.
section
406(b)
of
title
xvi
likewise
authorizes
a
court
to
order
attorney's
fee
withholding
upon
making
a
determination
favorable
to
the
claimant
in
judicial
proceedings.
they
lift
the
anti-assignment
bar
in
title
ii.
although
congress
incorporated
much
of
title
ii's
procedural
provisions
into
title
xvi,
it
did
not
include
either
of
these
provisions.
indeed,
comparison
of
the
relevant
provisions
in
titles
ii
and
xvi,
sections
406
and
1383,
reveals
a
remarkable
fact.
the
language
of
title
xvi...
congress
enacted
in
1972...
duplicates
the
language
of
title
ii
prior
to
1965
and
1967,
when
congress
amended
title
ii
to
provide
an
attorney's
fee
withholding.
congress,
in
effect,
reached
back
to
the
language
that
congress
enacted
in
1939
for
title
ii
rather
than
simply
adopt
title
ii's
then
current
language
in
1972.
the
language,
we
believe,
of
title
xvi
by
itself
suggests
that
the
omission
was
careful
and
deliberate.
the
legislative
history
confirms
the
deliberateness
of
congress's
decision,
and
answers
why
congress
chose
to
omit
withholding
from
title
xvi.
first,
as
we
lay
out
in
our
brief,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
considered
the
possibility
of
including
withholding
authority
in
title
xvi,
just
as
it
had
in
title
ii,
and
rejected
the
idea.
as
first
proposed
in
1970,
title
xvi
would
have
simply
incorporated
all
of
section
406
of
title
ii,
including
the
withholding
authority.
congress,
however,
subsequently
redrafted
the
bill
and
carefully
omitted
withholding
authority
from
title
xvi.
the
revision
was
not
a
product
of
mere
oversight.
it
was
precise,
it
was
surgical.
the
withholding
provisions
were
removed,
while
most
of
the
rest
of
section
406
was
carefully
retained.
congress,
moreover,
explained
why,
the
reasons
in
the
accompanying
legislative
reports.
congress
stated
its
view,
speaking
to
the
administrative
proceedings,
that
withholding
would
be
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
the
program.
the
purpose,
again,
unlike
for
title
ii,
is
to
provide
benefits
to
financially
needy
persons,
title
ii...
title
xvi
benefits,
unlike
title
ii,
being
needed
to
meet
basic
subsistence
needs.
congress
decided
that
withholding
those
benefits
from
those
needy
persons
was
not
warranted,
as
it
had
been
in
title
ii.
not
surprisingly,
respondent
concedes
that
congress
denied
the
courts
the
power
to
order
withholding
when
congress
first
enacted
title
xvi
in
1972.
respondent,
however,
contends
that
congress
somehow
revisited
the
issue
and
decided
to
allow
withholding
when
it
amended
title
xvi
in
1976.
the
claim,
we
believe,
does
not
withstand
serious
scrutiny.
the
amendment
upon
which
respondent
relies
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
attorney's
fee
withholding.
in
1972,
congress
had
decided
that
the
secretary's
administrative
determinations
under
title
xvi
would
be
subject
to
judicial
review,
as
they
were
under
title
ii,
with
one
exception.
the
determination
of
any
fact
by
the
secretary
would
be
final
and
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
in
1976,
congress
amended
the
law
to
omit
that
exception.
that
was
the
extent
of
the
revision.
it
was
a
deletion
of
one
prior
difference
between
the
two
titles
that
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
attorney's
fee
withholding.
it
concerned
section
405
of
title
ii,
while
the
two
attorney's
fee
provisions
of
title
ii
are
in
section
406.
if
congress
had
originally
in
1972
made
the
standards
of
judicial
review
exactly
the
same,
no
serious
claim
could
have
been
made
in
the
face
of
the
language
and
legislative
history
of
1972
that
congress
had
by
that
action
intended
to
allow
attorney's
fee
withholding.
that
congress
instead
only
achieved
that
result
by
an
amendment
and
a
deletion
to
title
xvi
four
years
later
wholly
unrelated,
for
reasons
wholly
unrelated,
to
attorney's
fee
withholding
does
not
add
any
credence
to
that
theory.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
not
with
respect
to
against
the
united
states.
we
have
several
provisions
which
we
think
would
bar
that.
one
there
is,
although
we've
not
pressed
the
claim
here,
there
is
a
sovereign
immunity
aspect
to
it.
there's
also
a
general
anti-assignment
provision
for
claims
against
the
u.s.,
and
then
in
this
statute
itself
we
have
section
1383(d),
which
incorporates
the
anti-assignment
bar
in
section
407
of
title
ii.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
the
secretary...
that
issue
is
not
presented
in
the
case,
but
it
is
the
secretary's
view
that
the
court
could;
that
we
do
not
interpret
the
statute
as
interfering
with
that
inherent
authority.
we
believe
it
presents
a
very
different
question.
it
doesn't
run
into
the
anti-assignment
provisions;
it
doesn't
direct
the
secretary
to
do
anything.
the
legislative
history
speaks
to
the
issue
of
withholding
and
not
to
the
issue
of
the
maximum
fees.
and
finally,
to
the
extent
that
congress
spoke
in
the
statute
at
all
to
ceilings,
it
actually
authorized
the
secretary
to
do
just
that
for
administrative
proceedings,
and
all
the
courts
actually
are
in
agreement
on
that
question,
that
the
courts
do
have
the
inherent
authority.
and
we
believe
that
presents
a
different
issue
not
raised
here.
in
sum,
the
sole
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
secretary's
construction
of
title
xvi
is
reasonable.
because
it
is
supported
by
the
language,
by
the
structure
of
the
statute,
and
the
legislative
history,
which
show
that
congress
considered
and
rejected
attorney's
fee
withholding
in
the
context
of
title
xvi,
we
believe
that
it
is.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
therefore,
should
be
reversed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
i
just
have
two
very
short
points.
one
is,
of
course,
ultimately
the
wisdom
of
the
statute
is
for
congress
and
not
for
the
court.
as
to
the
impact
of
congress's
decision,
one
can
speculate
that
perhaps
congress
hoped
that
the
financially
needy
would
be
eligible
for
legal
services
corporation
or
other
things,
and
therefore
the
impact
would
be
less
in
the
title
xvi
context.
i
have
nothing
else
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
