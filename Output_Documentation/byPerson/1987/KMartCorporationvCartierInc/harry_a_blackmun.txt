justice
blackmun
mr.
cohen,
i
am
just
curious.
has
a
stay
been
entered
in
this
case?
justice
blackmun
you
are
taking
the
position
then
that
the
treasury
has
been
consistent
throughout
the
years
and
did
not
take
a
different
position
in
the
second
circuit
case
in
1983?
justice
blackmun
but
at
least,
then,
the
government
has
been
inconsistent?
