mr.
william
h.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
risk
of
making
an
argument
even
more
one-sided,
i
will
say
a
word
or
two
about
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
the
district
courts
have
jurisdiction
of
actions
relating
to
trademark.
and
that
is
conferred
by
section
1338
of
title
28
and
by
a
provision
of
the
lanham
act.
the
district
court
here
had
and
exercised
that
jurisdiction.
it
had
the
traditional
district
court
trademark
jurisdiction
because
nothing,
i
submit,
in
section
1581
of
title
28
which
deals
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
international
trade,
makes
an
exception
to
the
traditional
trademark
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
for
this
kind
of
case.
certainly,
nothing
in
section
1581
says
in
terms
that
the
court
of
international
trade
has
jurisdiction
over
any
trademark
matters.
i
have
to
acknowledge,
however,
that
jurisdiction
has
been
found
to
reside
in
the
court
of
international
trade
by
that
court
and
it
was
affirmed
in
this
respect
by
the
federal
circuit
in
the
vivitar
case,
which
is
a
similar
case.
that
finding
was
based,
that
finding
was
based
on
provisions
of
subsection
(i)
of
section
1581
and,
in
particular,
paragraph
3.
that
is
at
page
9a
of
our
brief.
the
paragraph
gives
the
court
of
international
trade
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
against
the
government,
an
agency,
or
government
official,
arising
out
of
a
federal
statute
providing
for
and,
now,
i
quote:
embargoes
or
other
quantitative
restrictions
on
the
importation
of
merchandise
for
reasons
other
than
the
protection
of
public
health
or
safety.
the
argument
is
that
section
526
makes
the
importation
of
some
goods
bearing
a
united
states
trademark
unlawful
and,
therefore,
imposes
an
embargo
on
such
goods.
now,
there
are
reasons
set
forth
on
the
court
of
appeals
opinions
in
our
brief
what
that
is
not
a
tenable
view.
i
want
to
focus
on
just
one
of
them.
what
section
526
really
does
is
to
enable
the
owner
of
a
united
states
trademark
to
invoke
governmental
processes
to
bar
those
goods
bearing
his
trademark
that
he
wants
to
bar
and
conversely,
if
he
gives
consent,
to
allow
those
same
goods
that
may
be
quite
identical
to
enter
the
country.
the
customs
service
is
simply
directed
to
enforce
a
private
right
to
exclude
some
goods
and
admit
others
that
may
be
quite
indistinguishable.
and
i
submit
that
that
sort
of
enforcement
of
private
rights
is
not
within
the
common
understanding
or,
indeed,
any
reasonable
understanding
of
an
embargo.
that
very
point
was
made
during
the
debate
that
preceded
the
re-enactment
of
section
526
in
1930.
the
senate
debated
a
proposal
to
delete
from
section
526
the
consent
clause,
the
provision
that
allows
the
trademark
owner
to
consent
to
the
importation
of
goods
bearing
his
trademark.
senator
george
was
one
of
the
opponents
of
that
proposal
and
he
said
that
if
it
were
adopted,
if
it
were
adopted,
that
would
change...
that
would
change
section
526
into
an
embargo
kind
of
statute,
but
it
wasn't.
it
was
not
an
embargo
statute
as
it
then
stood.
there
are
plenty
of
embargo
statutes
on
the
books
for
this
provision
of
section
1581
to
apply
to.
there
are
some
statutes
that
directly
bar
imports
of
certain
goods
or
certain
goods
from
some
countries.
more
commonly,
there
are
statutes
like
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
the
trade
expansion
act,
the
international
economic
powers
act
that
empower
the
president
to
bar
those--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--i
do
not
see
how
this
is
a
quantitative
restriction,
even
less
a
quantitative
restriction.
that
is
the
typical
kind
of
thing
where
you
have
a
quota
on
goods.
i
would
have
though,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
i
just
really
would
have
thought
that
embargo
then
or
other
quantitative
restrictions,
that
it
has
to
do
with
a
measure
that
keeps
out
so
many
goods
of
this
sort
and
not
others.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
the
position.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
understand
that
is
the
issue,
your
honor,
and
i
simply
say:
no,
the
customs
service
is
not
directed
to
keep
goods
out
except
at
the
instance
of
a
private
trademark
owner
enforcing
his
trademark
right.
mr.
william
h.
allen
now,
let
me
turn,
let
me
turn
to
the
merits.
and
i
want
to
inquire
first
whether,
as
has
been
argued
here
this
afternoon,
i
think,
whether
section
526
as
it
is
in
fact
worded
can
be
made
to
sustain
a
meaning
that
is
consistent
with
the
customs
services
regulations
interpreting
it.
if
it
cannot,
if
it
can't,
then
i
think
my
clients
win.
in
every
case
that
i
am
aware
of
where,
in
the
eyes
of
some,
this
court
has
strained
a
statute,
it
has
thought
itself
bound
to
justify
what
it
has
done
by
reference
to
the
text,
the
statutory
words.
church
of
the
holy
trinity
and
perhaps
one
or
two
other
cases
may
be
exceptions,
but
this
is
clearly
not
the
case
where
statutory
words
taken
at
face
value
yields
some
sort
of
absurd
result
that
has
to
be
avoided.
you
take
any
of
the
cases:
bob
jones,
guerrera,
wmata
v.
johnson,
the
california
coastal
zone
case,
all
of
them...
all
of
them,
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
however
influenced
by
context,
by
secondary
sources
of
illumination
like
legislative
history
was
ultimately
related
to
statutory
text.
on
the
other
hand,
in
not
one
of
the
district
court
cases
in
which
section
526
has
been
held
to
have
a
limited
meaning
approximating
that
of
the
customs
service
regulations
has
a
court
engaged
in
any
textual
analysis.
i
suggest
that
this
inability
to
swear
statute
and
regulation
textually,
may
be
why
the
circuit
judges
of
the
federal
circuit
in
vivitar,
the
second
circuit
in
olympus,
as
well
as
the
judges
of
the
court
below,
were
unwilling
to
accept
the
regulations
as
correctly
interpreting
the
statute.
you
cannot
find,
you
certainly
cannot
find
the
exceptions
that
are
expressed
in
the
customs
regulations
in
the
words
of
the
statute.
they
are
not
there
explicitly.
the
question
is
whether
they
lurk
there
or
some
justification
for
them
lurks
in
the
statutory
words.
one
suggestion
offered
this
morning...
offered
this
afternoon
refers
to
the
term
of
the
statute
that
requires
that
trademark
be
owned
by
a
corporation
created
within
the
united
states,
a
citizen
or
a
corporation
created
within
the
united
states.
the
requirement
was
added
in
conference,
apparently
because
of
questions
raised
in
the
senate
debate,
and
the
part
of
the
senate
debate
to
which
mr.
cohen
referred...
and
i
commend
that
part
of
the
debate
to
your
honors.
the
lesson
i
draw
from
it
and
the
lesson
that
the
court
below
drew
from
it
is
quite
different
from
the
lesson
that
mr.
cohen
would
draw.
but,
in
any
event,
that
owned
provision
of
the
statute
was
added
in
the
conference
committee,
presumably
in
the
light
of
that
part
of
the
debate.
it
has
been
suggested
that
a
trademark
is
not
owned
by
the
united
states
subsidiary,
that
is
the
distributor
for
a
foreign
manufacturing
parent,
but
is
instead
owned
by
the
parent.
at
least
i
assume
that
is
the...
spell
it
out
fully
what
is
suggested.
but
the
fact
is,
the
fact
is
that
the
united
states
subsidiary
distributor
is
recognized
in
law
as
the
owner
of
the
united
states
trademark.
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes.
mr.
william
h.
allen
a
trademark
can
be
registered
only
by
the
owner
and
these
people,
the
subsidiary
distributors
have
the
registration
certificates.
they
are
the
ones
whom
the
patent
and
trademark
office
recognize
as
the
owner.
there
is
no
occasion
in
federal
law,
as
a
general
matter,
for
going
into
the
corporate
family
tree
of
the
apparent
owner
and
registrants.
there
was
a
simple
way,
there
was
a
simple
way
for
the
conference
committee
to
limit
the
class
of
corporate
trademark
owners
that
qualify
for
the
protection
of
section
526
if
it
had
wanted
to
do
that.
that
would
have
been
to
require
both
the
corporation
be
created
in
the
united
states
as
is
done
by
section
526
and
that
some
specified
proportion
of
the
voting
stock
and
some
proportion
of
directors
be
united
states
citizens.
that
is
done
in
some
other
federal
statutes,
which
we
referred
to
in
our
brief.
but
not
in
section
526.
but
in
any
event,
if
you
attribute
to
congress
the
meaning
of
the
word,
526
that
is
unknown
to
trademark
law,
you
don't
solve
the
problem
of
shoe-horning
the
customs
service
regulations
into
the
text
of
section
526.
the
regulations
deny
the
benefits
of
the
statute
to
american
manufacturing
companies
that
manufacture
trademark
goods
overseas
themselves
or
have
affiliates
or
licensees
that
do.
examples
of
duracell,
the
automobile
manufacturers,
proctor
&
gamble,
some
of
them
which
don't
even
import
any
of
the
goods
they
make
overseas.
all
of
which
have
described
their
gray
market
problems
in
amicus
briefs
in
these
courts.
if
those
companies
are
to
be
excluded
from
the
protection
of
section
526,
it
surely
can't
be
on
the
ground
that
they
don't
own
their
united
states
trademarks.
and
what
has
been
belatedly
suggested
is
that
the
case
of
these
american
manufacturing
companies
is
covered
by
another
term
of
the
statute.
we
have
to
go...
that
one
didn't
work,
so,
we
turn
to
another
provision.
the
requirement
that
goods
be
of
foreign
manufacture.
now,
that,
i
submit,
is
just
too
far-fetched.
congress
is
supposed
to
have
intended
by
this
argument
quite
ordinary
words
that
on
their
face
deal
with
where
goods
are
manufactured
in
order
to
refer
to
something
wholly
different,
i.e.,
who
manufactures
the
goods.
and
if
i
can
depart
for
a
moment
from
the
purely
textual
argument,
the
of
foreign
manufacture
amendment
was
introduced
in
response
to
a
question
that
had
been
marked
by
senator
lenroot
about
a
person
who
went
over
into
canada
and
bought
there
a
sack
of
the
fine
american
product,
wonder
flour,
that
had
been
imported
into
canada
and
now
was
going
to
bring
it
back.
he
said,
he
was
going
to
have
his
flour
confiscated
just
because
he
was
patriotic
and
wanted
to
buy
american
flour
instead
of
canadian
flour.
he
said,
he
said:
buys
that
merchandise,
suppose
the
american
citizen
purchased
and
brought
back
to
this
country
a
product
of
foreign
manufacture
with
a
foreign
trademark
and
paid
the
duty
on
it
in
the
regular
way.
he
distinguished
the
case
of
foreign
manufacture
from
the
case
of
american
manufacture.
he
was
talking
about
where
the
wonder
flour
was
made.
furthermore,
furthermore,
the
idea
that
of
foreign
manufacture
means
manufacture
by
a
non-u.
s.
company
can't
possibly,
can't
possibly
be
reconciled
with
the
debate
that
preceded
the
re-enactment
of
the
section
526
as
part
of
the
smoot
hawley
tariff
act
in
1930.
the
whole
subject
of
that
debate
was
goods
manufactured
abroad
by
american
companies.
the
senate
finance
committee
proposed
deleting
the
clause
at
the
end
of
section
526
that
permits
such
companies
to
consent
to
the
importation
of
their
goods.
the
idea
was
then
ford
motor
company
and
these
other
companies
that
the
senators
were
complaining
of
weren't
going
to
establish
overseas
plants
and
deprive
americans
of
jobs.
whatever
else
that
debate
implies
for
the
meaning
of
section
526
and
mr.
cohen
and
i
have
debated
the
issue
in
our
briefs,
i
think
it
is
on
the
whole,
that
the
debate
can't
possibly
be
reconciled
with
the
customs
service
regulations.
but
even
leaving
aside
that
debate
in
its
whole
breadth,
surely,
surely
as
to
this
matter,
if
even
one
senator...
if
even
one
senator
had
understood
that
the
words,
"of
foreign
manufacture",
meant
let
us
say
manufactured
by
a
foreign
company
that
has
no
ownership
or
licensing
ties
to
an
american
company,
he
would
have
said
so.
he
would
have
said,
"look
here.
"
"we
have
to
do
something
more
than
just
delete
this
consent
provision.
"
"because
that
statute
as
we
enacted
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this
case
we
are
talking
about.
"
"if
we
just
adopt
the
finance
committee's
amendment,
we're
going
to
wake
up
and
find
that
we
have
accomplished
nothing,
nothing
in
the
way
of
saving
american
jobs.
"
now,
that
brings
me...
that
brings
me
to
a
second
point.
i
think
my
clients
win
on
the
text.
it
can't...
the
text
of
section
526
can't
be
made
to
fit
the
regulations.
but
i
don't
lose.
i
don't
lose
i
don't
think
even
if
somebody
finds
some
way
of,
by
heroic
efforts,
of
making
the
fit.
because
what
we
want
to
know
finally
is
not
what
meaning
the
statute
might
be
made
to
sustain,
but
what
in
fact
congress
meant
when
it
enacted
the
statute
in
1922
and
re-enacted
it
in
1930.
now,
a
good
index
to
what
congress
meant
is
how
what
it
said
was
immediately
understood.
and
i
have
already
suggested
that
a
particularly
good
index
is
the
understanding
that
senators
in
1929
debating
the
re-enactment
of
section
526
had,
of
what
they
had
done
back
in
1922,
absolutely
nothing
to
suggest
that
any
of
them
thought
that
it
meant
what
the
present
customs
service
regulations
say
it
means.
and
a
lot,
a
lot
to
indicate
the
contrary.
but
that's
not
all.
those
who
wrote
the
regulations
for
the
old
customs
bureau
on
the
heels
of
the
enactment
of
the
tariff
act
of
1922
had
to
be
keenly
attuned
to
what
had
just
happened
in
congress.
you
would
expect
that
if
they
had
laid
the
emphasis
on
the
debate
in
the
senate,
the
five
or
six
columns
of
congressional
record
to
record
that
debate
that
is
now
laid
on
it
at
this
late
date,
they
might
have
said
something
like
this:
"section
526
is
written
in
seemingly
broad
terms,
but
in
fact
congress
meant
only
to
overrule
a
decision
of
a
court
of
appeals
on
its
narrowest
facts.
"
mr.
william
h.
allen
my
clients
don't
move
until
they
are
hurt,
i
suppose
is
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
and
my
clients
did
not
move
into
court
quickly
even
after
they
had
been
hurt.
there
is
a
good
deal
of
efforts
at
the
treasury
department,
at
the
customs
service
that
preceded
this
lawsuit.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
gray
market,
as
a
phenomenon,
has
bloomed
in
recent
years.
and,
indeed,
if
you
go
back
to
1972
rulemaking,
you
will
find...
and
this
is
in
the
record...
that
a
number,
a
number
of
companies,
a
number
of
entities
did
say,
"customs
service,
you
are,
you
are
interpreting
the
statute
wrong.
"
"section
133.21(c)
regulations
are
not
in
accord
with
section
526.
"
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
is
quite
possible
that...
i
mean
you
could
infer
that,
but
i
have
to
look
at
what
senators
lenroot
and
edge
and
mccumber
were
debating
at
the
end
of
the
1922
debate
in
congress
and
it
concerned
this
very
kind
of
thing:
what
about
the
pear's
soap
company
that
establishes
an
agent
in
the
united
states
and
he
registers
this
trademark.
i
mean
this...
at
least
the
concept
of
what
became
the
gray
market,
what
we
now
call
the
gray
market
issue
was
in
congress'
mind.
yes,
yes.
in
any
event,
those
regulation
writers
didn't
say
that.
they
didn't
say
anything
like
that.
they,
in
1923...
and
it
is
a
fortunate
thing.
there
were
regulations
that
were
written
in
1923
right
after
the
tariff
act
of
1922.
they
simply
paraphrased
the
statute.
mr.
william
h.
allen
just
the
same
way
in
1931,
the
regulation
writers
who
were
called
upon
to
flesh
out
the
smoot
hawley
tariff
act
gave
subsection
526
its
full
apparent
sweep.
and
then
you
had
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
deciding
a
case
about
this
time.
and
that
court,
of
course,
had
to
be
acutely
aware
of
section
526,
one
of
two
blows
suffered
by
its
katzel
decision:
reversal
by
this
court
and
overruling
by
congress.
and
were
not
just
acutely
aware
of
it,
but
perhaps
not
very
hospitable
to
it.
but
the
argument
was
made
to
that
court
that
section
526
should
be
limited
according
to
its
katzel
parentage
so
as
not...
so
as
not
to
bring
in
goods
that
were
not
imported
for
commercial
purposes.
in
that
case,
a
luxury
automobile.
judge
hand,
judge
augustus
hand
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court.
he
said
that,
of
course,
our
katzel
decision
brought
about
the
legislation,
but
that
fact
does
not
settle
the
scope
of
the
act.
and
he
called
it
this
"drastic",
"this
drastic
statute".
the
narrow
reading,
the
narrow
reading
of
section
526
that
is
now
advocated
was
put
to
several
contemporaneous
tests
and
it
flunked.
it
flunked
every
one
of
them.
you
have
to
move
all
the
way
ahead
to
1936
where
the
first
positive
evidence
that
can
be
pointed
to
of
someone
understanding
that
section
526
doesn't
mean
all
it
says.
and,
if
you
look
closely
at
the
supposed
evidence
from
1936,
it
evaporates.
it
evaporates.
the
evidence
is
a
provision
of
the
customs
service
regulations
that
were
amended
in
that
year.
the
second
sentence
of
the
amended
article
518(b).
it
is
at
page
28
of
the
joint
appendix.
on
its
face,
on
its
face,
the
amended
article
518(b)
is
a
belated
recognition
of
one
of
this
court's
decisions.
this
court
held
in
1923,
after
the
katzel
decision
that
a
section
of
the
trademark
act
that
forbids
the
importation
of
goods
with
a
trademark
that
copies
or
simulates
a
united
states'
trademark
applied
to
genuine
goods
with
a
trademark
identical
to
a
united
states
trademark.
the
amended
article
518(b)
cites
that
case
from
this
court
in
the
margin.
marginal
notation:
a.
bourjois
co.
v.
aldredge.
and
in
keeping
with
the
cited
aldredge
decision,
the
first
sentence
of
the
amended
article
518(b)
says
that
a
genuine
identical
trademark
shall
be
deemed
to
copy
or
simulate.
those
are
the
words,
exact
words,
a
united
states
trademark.
in
that
respect
and
others
that
are
stated
in
our
brief,
the
amended
article
518(b)
was
written
solely
in
terms
of
the
pertinent
section
of
the
trademark
act
and
not
at
all
in
terms
of
section
526.
second
sentence,
article
518(b)
begins
with
the
same,
with
the
word,
"however".
it
is
written
in
the
same
trademark
act
terms
and
says
that
if
the
foreign
trademark...
the
united
states
trademark
are
owned
by
the
same
person,
partnership,
association
or
a
corporation,
the
foreign
trademark
shall
not
be
deemed
to
copy
or
simulate
the
united
states
trademark.
that,
"aha",
say
the
petitioners,
"that
is
the
harbinger
of
everything
that
is
stated
in
the
1972
regulations.
"
not
so.
not
so
at
all.
the
overall
reason
obviously
was
to,
for
this
regulation,
was
to
recognize
after
13
years
the
force
of
this
court's
aldredge
decision,
the
gloss
that
it
had
put
on
section
27
of
the
trademark
act.
it
appears
from
what
congress
was
told
when
it
was
considering
trademark
legislation
in
1944,
it
appears
that
the
second
sentence
qualifying
the
general
aldredge
rule
was
nothing
more
complicated
than
someone's
conceptual
difficulty
with
the
idea
that
a
person's
own
foreign
trademark
could
be
said
to
copy
or
simulate
his
identical
united
states
trademark.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
supposed
policy
of
section
526
or
for
that
matter
any
policy
of
the
trademark
act.
we
can't
know
this
for
sure
because
the
customs
service
has
never
once
explained
its
regulations.
not
once.
not
once
explained
what
it
was
doing
when
it
made
an
amended
regulation.
but
the
explanation
was
given,
as
i
have
said,
to
a
congressional
committee
by
a
witness
from
what
was
then
the
tariff
commission.
and,
without
contradiction,
he
told
the
committee
that
article
518,
the
amended
article
518
in
1936
effected
only
section
27
and
did
not...
and
did
not
limit
the
reach
of
section
526.
and
i
would
pass
from
there
to
the
1950's
and
invite,
invite
your
honors'
particular
attention
to
the
discussion
of
the
guerlain
case
in
our
brief
and
of
the
solicitor
general's
motion
in
this
court
to
vacate
the
judgment
in
favor
of
the
government
where
he
said
that
the
customs
authorities
have
deemed
themselves
legally
constrained
to
grant
the
claim
of
statutory
protection
invoked
by
the
american
distributors
of
french
perfumes
who
were,
according
to
judge
edelstein's
decision,
part
of
a
single
international--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--it
is
very
hard
to
make
that
out,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
there
was,
indeed.
they
did
contest
that.
but
listen
to
what
further
the
solicitor
general
said.
he
was
asking
the
judgment
be
vacated
so
that
they
could
ask
for
legislation.
he
said,
"an
intragovernmental
conflict
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
tariff
or
trademark
laws
should
be
resolved
through
means
other
than
antitrust
litigation.
"
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
that
is
barely
possible.
mr.
william
h.
allen
but
if...
then
if
it
is
only
the
same
company,
it
surely
doesn't
reach--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--at
least
one
of
the
perfume
companies
in
that
case
was
a
simple
parent
and
subsidiary
situation,
according
to
edelstein's
finding.
mr.
william
h.
allen
guerlain
was
not.
but
at
least
one
of
them
was.
but
that...
well,
it
is
a
suggestion,
your
honor.
i
had
thought
it
seems
a
narrow
view
to
talk
about--
mr.
william
h.
allen
--it
is
possible,
your
honor.
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
an
intragovernmental
conflict
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
tariff
or
trademark
laws
would
be
that...
would
be
that
narrow
a
conflict.
but
i
can
be
wrong.
