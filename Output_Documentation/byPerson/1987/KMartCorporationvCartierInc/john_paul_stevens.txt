mr.
cohen,
even
under
your
theory,
i
think
it
gives
more
substance
to
the
mark
than
just
an
identifier...
even
the
second
circuit
litigation,
the
way
this
court
decided
it,
said
it
was
more
than
an
identifier.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
they
are
made
by
the
same
party.
weren't
they
the
same
source
of
goods
in
that
case?
justice
stevens
no,
but
they
were
made
by
the
goods
the
u.s.
trademark
owner
sold,
were
also
made
by
the
same
manufacturer;
weren't
they?
justice
stevens
so,
they
had
a
common
source.
justice
stevens
mr.
cohen,
would
you
just
be...
just
so
i
am
sure
i
have
your
point.
you
said
there
are
two
principles
that
this
546
might
have
indicated.
would
you
state
the
two
principles?
justice
stevens
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
though,
that
one
of
the
respondents
does
still
maintain
there
is
no
jurisdiction.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
provide
for
an
embargo,
it
provides
that
a
private
party
may
impose
a
total
restriction.
that
is
not
providing
for
an
embargo.
justice
stevens
enforcing
its
embargo.
it
doesn't
provide
for...
okay.
justice
stevens
they
just
parroted
the
statute.
justice
stevens
but
mr.
allen,
wasn't
that
partly
because
of
the
debate
over
whether
they
are
related
companies
or
the
same
company
within
the--
justice
stevens
--because
there
was
a
factual
dispute
as
to
whether
they
were
the
same
company.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
that
could
be
that
the
department
justice
thought
that
the
exception
extended
to
related
companies
and
treasury
thought
it
only
went
to
the
same
company.
there
is
that
history.
justice
stevens
there
was
a
debate
over
that
at
the
time.
justice
stevens
well,
same
or
affiliated.
same
in
the
sense
of
100
percent
owned,
whereas
the
related
company
concept
talked
about
partially
owned.
justice
stevens
but
one
was
not.
guerlain
was
not,
i
think.
justice
stevens
but
it
is
possible
if
there
was
that
dispute
between
treasury
and
justice,
not
necessarily
the
dispute
as
to
whether
to
the
statute
meant
exactly
what
it
said.
