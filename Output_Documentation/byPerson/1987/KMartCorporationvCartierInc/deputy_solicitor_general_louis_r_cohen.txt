mr.
louis
r.
cohen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
as
this
court
explained
quite
clearly
in
prestonettes
and
again
in
champion
spark
plug,
a
trademark
owner
has
the
right
to
prevent
other
people
from
applying
his
mark
to
their
goods.
but
he
does
not
have
any
right,
by
virtue
of
the
trademark,
to
restrict
resales
of
his
own
goods
after
he
has
put
them
into
commerce.
the
treasury
department
has,
we
think,
validly
interpreted
section
526
of
the
tariff
act
in
accordance
with
that
basic
distinction.
it
is
common
ground
between
the
parties
that
section
526
protects
a
u.s.
trademark
owner
against
importation
of
goods
bearing
his
trademark
that
were
manufactured
abroad
by
someone
else.
section
526
responded
to
the
second
circuit
ruling
in
the
katzel
case
which
had
allowed
the
importation
of
such
goods
as
non-infringing
on
the
ground
that
they
were
genuine
in
the
country
they
came
from.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no,
justice
blackmun,
but
there
has
been
only
a
declaratory
judgment.
there
is
no
injunction
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
would
not
be
appropriate.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
statute
also
does
something
quite
different:
whether
it
gives
an
enterprise
operating
in
more
than
one
country
a
right,
a
continuing
right
by
virtue
of
the
trademark
to
stop
its
own
goods
at
the
u.s.
border
after
it
has
sold
them
abroad.
nothing
in
katzel
or
the
legislative
history
suggests,
and
i
will
argue
that
it
is
wholly
implausible,
that
congress
intended
any
such
fundamental
change
in
the
nature
of
a
trademark.
and,
so,
treasury
has
long
interpreted
the
section
as
not
barring
importation
where
the
u.s.
owner
itself
placed
the
goods
in
foreign
commerce
or
in
certain
functionally
similar
cases.
copiat,
respondents,
argue
that
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
compel
exclusion
of
the
goods
in
those
cases,
too.
but
it
is
altogether
proper,
we
suggest
to
construe
a
statute
as
not
encompassing
every
situation
its
words
might
literally
reach
when
that
would
produce
results
congress
did
not
intend.
as
the
court
said
a
century
ago,
a
statute
making
it
a
crime
to
hinder
a
mail
carrier
in
the
swift
completion
of
his
rounds
is
quite
properly
read
as
if
it
contained
the
words
except
when
the
mailman
has
just
committed
a
felony
or
is
about
to
deliver
a
bomb.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
government's
view
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
section
1581,
if
read
literally,
might
confer
exclusive
jurisdiction
on
the
court
of
international
trade,
but
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
understanding
that
what
congress
was
getting
at
there
was
actions
arising
under
trade
statutes
of
which
this
is
not
one.
the
court
has
often
construed
statutes
more
narrowly
than
the
words
alone
might
literally
suggest
in
order
to
results
that
congress
did
not
intend.
i
think
it
is
quite
implausible
that
the
1922
congress
intended
to
change
a
trademark
from
an
identifying
mark
only
into
a
partial
permanent
leash
on
the
goods
themselves.
it
is
implausible,
first--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
what
this
court
said
was
that:
if
i
am
the
u.s.
owner
of
a
trademark,
the
fact
that
someone
else
owns
the
same
mark
in
france
and,
therefore,
legally
entitled
to
make
and
sell
goods
in
france
doesn't
mean
that
those
goods,
which
would
otherwise
be
infringing
goods
in
the
united
states,
because
he
is
not
me,
can
come
into
the
states.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no.
the
goods
that
were
made
in
france
were
not
made
by
the
u.s.
trademark
owner.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
he
got
them
and
he
reprocessed
them.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
and
he
reprocessed
them.
but
the
case
would
have
been,
i
suggest,
exactly
the
same
if
what
had
happened
was
that
the
u.s.
rights
to
manufacture
had
been
bought
by
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
and
what
you
had
were
some
goods
manufactured
in
the
united
states
by
the
plaintiff
and
some
goods
manufactured
in
france
by
the
defendant.
and
the
plaintiff
saying,
"those
french
goods
are
infringing
when
they
come
over
here
because
they
are
not,
they
are
not
mine.
"
the
case
would
have
been
quite
different,
i
suggest,
and
this
court
would
have
decided
it
differently
and
congress
would
have
reacted
differently
if
the
u.s.
manufacturer
had
established
a
french
factory
and
then
said,
"because
i
am
manufacturing
these
goods
in
france
and
i
want
to
keep
them
there,
my
trademark
will
keep
them
out
of
the
united
states.
"
i
don't
think
either
this
court
or
the
congress
would
have
had
the
reaction
that
they
did.
i
was
starting
to
say
that
i
think
i
get
some
help
from
the
very
text
of
the
statute
which
explicitly
protects
only
u.s.
owners
of
trademarks
and
protects
them
only
against
goods
of
foreign
manufacture.
those
requirements,
which
are
not
found
elsewhere
in
trademark
law,
make
sense
on
our
view
that
congress
was
assuming
that
the
u.s.
trademark
owner
and
the
foreign
manufacturer
would
be
two
different
people
and
was
seeking
to
protect
the
trademark
owner
from
the
foreign
manufacturer's
goods.
they
make,
i
suggest,
no
sense
those
limitations
on
copiat's
view
that
congress
was
seeking
to
change
the
characteristics
of
a
trademark,
to
make
it
broader
to
bar
the
flow
of
all
goods
bearing
its
mark,
including
its
own,
into
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
that
you
should
interpret
it
in
accordance
with
it
intent
as
discerned
from
its
language
and
its
context
and
its
history.
there
are,
here,
two
different
possible
general
principles
and
i
think--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
have
in
this
case
at
least
the
general
legal
background
of
the
trademark
law
as
asserted
by
this
court
i
think
in
katzel
and
the
following
year
in
prestonettes
which
did
not
extend...
which
did
not
make
one
of
the
characteristics
of
a
trademark
a
right
to
bar
the
sale
of
somebody
else's
goods.
the
trademark
law
says
that
i
can't
make
a
car
in
my
garage
and
sell
it
as
a
chevrolet.
it
doesn't
say
that
i
can't
resell
one
of
general
motors'
chevrolets
anywhere
i
want
to.
and
it
would
have
been
quite
startling
for
this
statute
to
have
changed
the
law
that
much,
i
think.
and
i
think
some
of
the
language
that
congress
used
indicates
that
that
is
not
what
they
were
trying
to
do.
and,
therefore,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
here
as
it
was
in
guerrera
where
the
court
read
the
language
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
requiring
pregnant
women
to
be
treated
the
same
as
other
employees,
as
a
floor
and
not
as
a
ceiling,
as
the
court
did
in
the
colorado
public
industry
research
group
case
where
it
read
pollutants
and
radioactive
materials
not
to
include
nuclear
wastes
as
not
reaching
a
case
that
there
is
evidence
congress
didn't
intend
to
reach.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
we
think
what
526
and
this
court's
decision
in
katzel
did
was
to
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
goods
are
genuine
abroad
does
not
mean
that
they
do
not
infringe
here
if
there
is
somebody
else
in
the
united
states
who
owns
the
trademark.
i
take
it
that
copiat
thinks
that
526
means
that
the
trademark
owner
in
the
united
states
has
the
right
to
say
that
goods
to
which
it
applied
its
own
trademark
in
some
foreign
country
are
not
trademarked
in
the
united
states.
i
think
that...
let
me
say
it
a
different
way.
i
think
that
526
means
that
if
i
own
the
u.s.
trademark
and
somebody
else
owns
the
french
trademark
for
some
goods,
his
goods
are
infringing
here
even
though
they
are
genuine
in
france.
i
think
it
does
not
mean
that
if
i
owned
both
the
u.s.
trademark
and
the
french
trademark
i
am
entitled
to
be
treated
as
two
different
people.
i
think
that
the
limitations
in
the
statute
to
u.s.
owners
and
to
goods
of
foreign
manufacture
make
no
sense
on
copiat's
view.
if
they
intended
to
give
all
trademark
owners
such
a
right
to
stop
their
own
goods
at
the
border,
there
would
be
no
reason
to
require
nikon
to
form
a
shell
u.s.
subsidiary
to
hold
the
trademark
and,
conversely,
there
would
be
no
reason
to
require
kodak
to
build
an
offshore
factory
in
order
to
get
the
protection
of
section
526.
now,
the
other
thing
i
will
point
to
is
one
important
episode
in
the
brief
legislative
history.
it
is
the
senate
discussion
of
the
pear's
soap
hypothetical
which
suggests
that
everybody,
whether
for
or
against
section
526
was
against
giving
foreign
companies
the
right
to
restrict
the
flow
of
their
own
goods
into
the
united
states.
copiat
is
reduced
to
suggesting
that
the
sponsors
of
526
were
wrong
in
claiming
that
526
didn't
do
what
copiat
would
like.
and
the
opponents
were
correct
in
fearing
that
it
would
do
what
neither
they
nor
the
sponsors
wanted.
there
isn't
any
reason
why
a
statute
that
can
be
read
perfectly
straight
forwardly
to
do
what
everyone
agrees
congress
intended,
must
also
be
wrote
so
literally
as
to
do
something
no
one
in
congress
wanted.
this
is
also,
it
seems
to
us,
an
appropriate
case
for
deference
to
the
agency.
it
is,
i
think,
at
the
very
least
not
clear
from
the
text
and
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
permit
a
u.s.
trademark
owner
to
bar
importation
of
its
own
goods.
copiat
challenges
treasury's
consistency,
but
the
basic
principle
of
the
treasury
regulation
that
526
doesn't
give
a
trademark
owner
the
right
to
bar
its
own
goods
sold
abroad
from
being
imported
into
the
united
states
has
been
set
forth
in
the
regulations
at
all
times
since
1936
and
very
clearly
and
consistently
since
1943.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
as
to
treasury.
that
brief
was
signed
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
customs
service.
it
was
not
authorized
by
treasury
and
it
should
not
have
been
filed.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
to
that
extent...
i
was
going
to
say
the
government
has
also
varied
in
its
handling
of
a
point
that
i
don't
think
is
at
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
extension
of
the
general
principle
that
i
have
been
talking
about
to
cases
involving
companies
that
are
more
distantly
related.
there
has
been
some
adjustment
in
the
articulation
and
probably
in
the
policy,
but
this
case
is
not
and
has
never
been
about
where
the
treasury's
line
ought
to
be
drawn.
this
case
as
framed
by
copiat
has
always
been
about
whether
there
can
be
an
exception
at
all.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
and
we
have
filed--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes.
and
we
filed
a
memorandum
which
is
probably
lost
in
the
stack
of
briefs
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect
to
the
textual
argument,
our
position
is
that
it
is
entirely
appropriate
to
read
this
text
with
the
implicit
contextual
qualification
supplying
the
ellipses,
if
you
will,
that
after
the
words,
"bears
a
trademark",
it
said...
"bears
a
trademark
not
applied
by
the
u.s.
owner
or
any
affiliate.
"
we
think
the
evidence
is
consistent
with
the
notion
that
that
was
the
intention
of
this
statute.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
no
more
than
you
have
to
rewrite
an
agreement
with
panama
that
says,
"any
tax",
to
read
it
to
say,
"any
tax,
but
not
a
u.s.
tax.
"
or
to
rewrite
the
statute
that
was
involved
in
watt
v.
alaska
which
talks
about
minerals
on
federal
wildlife
refuges
to
read:
"but
not
on
reserved
lands,
only
on
acquired
lands.
"
let
me
respond
to
some
of
the
points
that
mr.
allen
has
made.
with
respect
to
the
first
version
of
the
regulations,
it
is
true
that
the
first
version
of
the
regulations
simply
parroted
the
statute.
the
1922
act
was
a
massive
statute.
it
constituted
almost
the
whole
of
title
19.
that
treasury
did
not
see
fit
to
do
anything
other
than
quote
the
statute
in
the
regulations
that
were
adopted
immediately
thereafter,
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
have
much
bearing
one
way
or
the
other.
the
clark
pease
case,
the
second
circuit
case
to
which
mr.
allen
was
referring
was
not
about
the
issue
that
is
presently
before
the
court.
it
was
about
whether
the
word,
"merchandise",
applies
to
goods
brought
in
for
personal
use.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
opinion
of
that
case
that
the
u.s.
trademark
owner
and
the
foreign
trademark
were
the
same
person
or
were
in
any
way
related.
i
will
concede
that
the
1936
regulations,
although
they
cite
section
526
and
contain
an
explicit
exception
for
the
related
company
situation,
don't
do
so
as
neatly
as
we
might
wish.
i
think
that
the
1943
regulations
leave
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
treasury
is
treating
the
lanham
act
section,
section
27,
which
later
became
the
section
42
of
the
lanham
act
dealing
with
copies
and
section
526
together
and
provided
quite
clearly
as
to
both
of
them
an
exception
that
persists
to
this
day
for
goods
of
the
u.s.
trademark
owner.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
and
the
court
said
quite
clearly
in
the
1940
american
truckinq
association
case
where
it
was
holding
that
a
statute
given
the
icc
jurisdiction
of
the
wages
and
hours
of
trucking
company
employees,
the
court
said,
"it
is
said
that
a
broader
reading
would
not
be
absurd,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
absurd.
"
"what
we
are
looking
for
is
what
congress
intended.
"
and,
therefore,
it
limited
the
words
of
that
statute
to
the
case
of
employees
with
safety-related
jobs.
