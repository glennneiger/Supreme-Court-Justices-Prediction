mr.
robert
w.
steele
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
considerable
weight
should
be
accorded
to
an
executive
department's
interpretation
and
construction
of
a
statute
when
that
department
has
been
entrusted
with
the
administration
of
the
statute.
this
is
an
especially
strong
case
for
the
application
of
that
doctrine
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
regulation
in
question
has
been
in
existence
in
one
form
or
another
since
1936.
second,
the
regulation
has
been
brought
before
congress
repeatedly
in
that
time
period
and
has
been
endorsed
not
by
congressional
silence
but
by
actual
congressional
language
in
regard
to
specific
legislation
presented
to
the
congress.
and,
third,
and
perhaps
more
important
from
the
standpoint
of
my
client,
one
of
the
intervenors
in
this
case,
during
the
50
years
that
this
statute
has
been
interpreted
by
the
customs
service
as
it
has
been
interpreted,
a
tremendous
and
substantial
business
has
grown
up
in
the
united
states
among
retailers
based
upon
parallel
imports,
that
everyone
believes
are
lawful.
and
everyone
in
the
industry,
the
retail
industry,
believes
to
be
lawful
and
believed
for
many
years
to
be
lawful.
my
client
is
k
mart
corporation,
a
discount
department
store
chain
with
2,000
locations
throughout
the
united
states.
we
are
one
of
the
intervenors.
47th
street
photo
is
the
other
intervenor
who
appears
as
a
petitioner
in
this
matter
also
selling
merchandise
and
parallel
imports
included
at
discount
prices.
the
issue
is
important
to
the
k
marts
and
the
47th
street
photos
because
of
the
difficulties
that
discounters
have
in
obtaining
trademark
merchandise
from
time
to
time.
they
provide
price
competition.
but
more
importantly
than
just
the
discount
segment
of
the
retail
industry,
the
retailing
industry
generally
handles
some
parallel
imports.
most
retailers
handle
parallel
imports.
they
provide
price
competition
with
those
imports.
they
are
a
tool,
an
anti-monopoly
tool.
and
in
this
case,
i
must
say
that
nothing
in
a
brief
filed
in
the
second
circuit
was
on
the
record
to
give
notice
to
this
industry
that
there
had
been
a
change
in
the
views
of
any
of
the
agencies
in
washington,
d.c.
indeed,
the
language
of
the
regulation
in
question
has
remained
substantially
the
same
during
the
time
period
with
one
exception.
in
the
1950's,
after
the
passage
of
the
lanham
act,
the
language
was
arguably
broadened
to
permit
more
goods
to
be
brought
into
the
united
states
with
a
reference
to
the
lanham
act
language
for
related
companies
dealing
with
affiliated
companies
and
control.
now,
that
language
stayed
in
the
regulation
until
1959.
it
didn't
narrow
it,
as
the
respondents
would
contend
it
should.
it
broadened
it.
it
is
not
a
real
inconsistency
in
the
sense
that
it
supports
the
position
which
has
been
taken
by
the
respondents
in
this
case.
during
that
same
time
period,
this
general
understanding
of
the
statute
has
been
presented
to
congress
a
number
of
times.
now,
as
mr.
cohen
has
pointed
out,
section
526
was
passed
very
clearly
to
remedy
a
perceived
defect
in
a
ruling
under
the
1902
trademark
law.
and
that
ruling
arose
in
the
case
of
bourjois
&
co.
v.
katzel.
and
that
is
what
caused
526
to
be
passed.
in
1936,
treasury
interpreted
the
rule
to
provide
and
to
allow
for
parallel
imports.
but,
more
importantly,
when
the
trademark
act
was
amended
with
the
lanham
act
in
1946,
extensive
reports
were
made
to
congress
before
the
passage
of
the
lanham
act.
and
in
passing
the
lanham
act,
congress
was
told
repeatedly
that
this
regulation
is
on
the
books.
and
under
the
trademark
law
and
under
526,
it
was
not
envisioned
that
when
one
company,
a
multi-national
company
is
manufacturing
overseas
and
has
a
u.s.
subsidiary,
it
is
not
envisioned
that
that
u.s.
subsidiary
will
be
able
to
keep
those
imports
out.
congress
was
told
that.
they
put
nothing
in
the
lanham
act--
mr.
robert
w.
steele
--yes.
mr.
robert
w.
steele
mr.
justice--
mr.
robert
w.
steele
--i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
clear
line.
we
did
not
raise
the
point
of
objection
of
jurisdiction
originally
when
we
intervened
in
the
case.
k
mart
corporation
took
the
position
at
the
time
that
we
felt
that
it
should
be
litigated
in
the
district
court
in
this
particular
proceeding.
so,
we
have
not
briefed
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
and
our
position
on
the
matter
is
that
a
number
of
cases
have
been
brought
and
without
undercutting
the
positions
validly
raised
by
47th
street
photo,
we
have
not
addressed
those
intervening
for
the
primary
purpose
of
dealing
with
the
substantive
issue
pertaining
to
the
imports.
if
i
may
turn
very
briefly
to--
mr.
robert
w.
steele
--47th
street
does
address
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
w.
steele
the
united
states
has
not
address
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
robert
w.
steele
turning
back
to
the
contentions
i
wish
to
make,
in
whatever
court
the
issue
arises,
it
has
been
our
belief
that
there
is
ample
legislative
background
to
endorse
the
view
that
congress
has
seen
this
interpretation
for
many
years
and
has
chosen
not
to
disturb
it.
the
lanham
act
is
one
example
and
equally
critical
example
and
more
up
to
date
arises
in
1984
when
the
lanham
act
was
amended
by
the
so-called
counterfeiting
act
of
1984.
that
counterfeiting
act
when
it
came
in
originally
covered
a
number
of
different
subjects
and
was
the
subject
of
extensive
consideration
by
the
senate
judiciary
committee.
and
the
senate
judiciary
committee
when
it
referred
out
the
legislation
ultimately
passed,
it
said
the
act
did
not
include
within
its
coverage
so-called
gray
market
goods,
i.e.,
authentic
trademark
goods
that
have
been
obtained
from
overseas
markets.
the
importation
of
such
goods
is
legal
under
certain
circumstances.
for
example,
the
treasury
department
has
long
interpreted
section
526
to
permit
the
importation
of
such
goods.
now,
at
this
point,
before
the
court,
we
have
an
interpretation
which
is
clearly
not
congressional
silence
sanctioning
the
treasury
department,
but
express
language
from
congress.
equally
important
is
a
recent
situation
in
which
congress
was
called
upon
to
look
at
the
situation
arising
from
a
liquor
importation
question
wherein
specific
legislation
was
proposed
which
would
change
the
trademark...
the
trademark
regulations
and
the
regulations
of
the
customs
service.
it
was
rejected.
thank
you.
