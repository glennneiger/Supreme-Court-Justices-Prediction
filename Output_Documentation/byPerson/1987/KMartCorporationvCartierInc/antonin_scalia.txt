justice
scalia
mr.
cohen,
neither
the
brief
of
government
nor
your
argument
thus
far
addresses
the
issue
of
proper
jurisdiction
in
the
case.
do
you
intend
to
say
anything
about
it?
justice
scalia
congress
never
writes
a
statute
that
does
more
than
it
was
intended
to
do.
is
that
the
thesis?
whenever
a
statute
necessarily
written
in
general
language
goes
beyond
the
specific
evils
sought
to
be
remedied,
we
should
interpret
it,
despite
its
language
so
that
it
covers
only
the
specific
evils
sought
to
be
remedied?
justice
scalia
well,
i
am
talking
about
its
language,
not
its
intent.
the
postman
situation
you
give
me
is
a
situation
in
which
you
have
a
different
statute
that
expresses
a
different
policy
which
has
to
somehow
be
reconciled
with
the
statute
protecting
the
postman
in
the
execution
of
his
daily
rounds.
and
if
there
were
another
statute
here
that
similarly
indicated
an
intention
that
these
goods
should
be
admitted,
then
we
would
have
a
different
problem.
but,
as
far
as
the
explicit
language
of
the
statute
is
concerned,
it
covers
this
situation
as
well
as
the
narrow
situation
that
was
immediately
before
the
congress.
justice
scalia
mr.
steele,
i
am
sorry.
can
i
interrupt?
justice
scalia
i
have
a
problem...
i
am
afraid
i'm
going
to
hear
no
argument
to
it
from
your
side
unless
i
hear
something
from
you
on
it.
and
that
is
the
point
on
whether
this
matter
should
have
been
brought
to
the
trade
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals
here.
justice
scalia
i
realize
that
financially
this
particular
case
is
enormously
important,
but
from
the
point
of
view...
the
merits
of
the
case
are
enormously
important.
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
confusion
in
future
cases
for
the
federal
courts,
the
jurisdictional
issue
may
well
be
the
more
significant.
and
i
would
like
to
know
what
interpretation
of
the
language
of
the
statute
you
propose
that
will
prevent
jurisdictional
disputes
into
the
endless
future.
what
is
the
clear
line
of
jurisdiction
the
trade
court
and
the
other
federal
courts?
justice
scalia
no.
it
is
sort
of
a
one-sided
argument
we
have
here.
no
one
else
even
seems
to
want
a
day
to
discus
the
point.
justice
scalia
the
response
to
that,
mr.
allen,
i
presume
is
that
the
senate
realized
that
and
taking
that
into
account
didn't
just
say
embargo.
it
said
embargo
or
other
quantitative
restrictions.
justice
scalia
i
would
have
thought
it
was
meant
to
distinguish
it
from
a
restriction
that
consists
of
a
high
tariff.
there
is
no
quantitative
restriction,
but
the
restriction
is
the
dis-incentive
caused
by
the
tariff.
justice
scalia
well,
it
is
important...
to
my
mind,
it
is
important
to
have
some
clear
line
because
we
are
going
to
be
struggling
with
this
problem
in
many
more
contexts
than
we
are
going
to
be
struggling
with
the
merits
problem
that
you
seek
to
have
before
us.
the
line
you
would
draw
is
if
the
admission
of
the
goods
is
dependent
upon
the
voluntary
agreement
of
a
private
party,
it
does
not
constitute
an
embargo
or
quantitative
restriction.
justice
scalia
we
would
also
expect,
though,
mr.
allen,
that
if
your
clients
had
thought
that
this
regulation
was
as
contrary
to
the
statute
as
you
now
tell
us
it
is,
they
would
have
challenged
it
many,
many
years
ago.
justice
scalia
well,
i
must
say
that
is
admirable
restraint.
i
wish
more
prospective
litigants
would
emulate
it.
[laughter]
i
am
just
interested
in
exploring
that
a
little
more.
if
the
answer
to
the
absence
of
litigation
challenging
the
regulation,
and
surely
the
amoco
brief
indicates
it
is
a
pretty
important
problem
to
a
lot
of
people,
is
because
the
problem
bloomed
lately,
the
gray
market
problem
bloomed
lately,
would
that
no
suggest
that
it
was
not
a
problem
congress
gave
any
thought
to?
justice
scalia
mr.
cohen,
you
don't
contend
that
the
interpretation
being
urged
by
respondents
here
produces
an
absurdity;
do
you?
will
you
concede
also
that
that
result
is
not
an
absurd
result?
just
a
policy
result
that
you
say
congress
didn't
have
in
mind.
