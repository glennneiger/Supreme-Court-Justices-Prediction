justice
byron
r.
white
counsel,
suppose
that
the
ceo
of
volkswagen
germany
were
in
illinois
for
a
business
meeting
for
a
day
and
he
were
served,
what
result?
would
you
have
to
comply
with
the
treaty?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
language
in
the
treaty
that
you
rely
on
in
order
to
support
your
conclusion
that
the
documents
would
necessarily
have
to
be
transmitted
abroad
as
a
practical
matter?
because
they
don't
have
to
be
transmitted
as
a
legal
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
not
what
the
treaty
says.
the
treaty
says
where
there
is
occasion
to
transmit
a
judicial
or
extrajudicial
documents
for
service
abroad.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
company
does
it
voluntarily,
not
as
a
legal
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
are
you
saying
that
it's
irrelevant
that
the
document
has
to
be
transmitted
abroad?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
we
have
to
focus
on
the
language
of
the
treaty
in
that
clause,
don't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
then,
in
the
example
i
give,
why
is
there
any
necessity
to
transmit
the
document
abroad?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
knows.
the
president,
in
the
hypothetical
case
receives
the
document
in
illinois.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
just
don't
understand
the
principle
that
you're
urging
on
us
as
the
determinant
for
when
the
treaty
applies
and
when
it
doesn't.
you
say:
well,
if
the
corporation
is
in
illinois.
but
we
know
that
corporations
are
physically
present
only
through
their
agents.
you
seem
to
assume
there
has
to
be
a
large
manufacturing
plant
there
and
that
that
would
do
it.
this
is
just
an
unprincipled
rationale
that
you're
urging
upon
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
it's
an
agent
appointed
for
the
service
of
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
that
situation,
the
papers
still
go
abroad.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
there's
an
office
in
the
state,
that
the
foreign
corporation
voluntarily
set
it
up.
they
haven't
qualified
to
do
business
but
they
should
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
suggest
that
if
a
foreign
corporation
sets
up
an
office
in
a
state
or
in
such
a
way
that
it
should
have
qualified
but
did
not,
that
that
office
could
be
served?
it
did
it
voluntarily.
it
set
it
up.
and
here's
an
office.
they're
doing
business.
they
should
have
qualified
and
appointed
an
agent.
they
did
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
you
agree
on
my
example
that
the
foreign
corporation
could
be
served
through
its
office
in
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
rule
is
that
this
applies
to
any
foreign
corporation
that
has
not
appointed
an
agent
for
service
of
process
within
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
suppose
volkswagen
is
physically
present
in,
say,
the
state
of
new
york,
with
a
major
corporate
office
and
a
manufacturing
plant,
too.
and
then
the
state
of
illinois,
through
service
of
process,
serves
volkswagen
in
new
york.
what
result?
