mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
volkswagen
is
fundamentally
mistaken
in
arguing
that
the
hague
service
convention
gives
foreign
corporations
blanket
immunity
from
local
service
rules.
article
1
states
the
convention
comes
into
play
only
when
there
is
occasion
to
transmit
a
judicial
document
for
service
abroad.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
french
language
is
even
stricter
than
that.
and
it
says,
essentially,
that
the
convention
is
applicable
only
when
the
document
must
be
transmitted
abroad
to
be
served
there.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
in
this
context,
it
would
be.
i
think
the
best
interpretation
would
be
must
or
is
to
be
transmitted.
in
any
event,
it
seems
quite
clear
that
it
does
not
leave
much
room
for
the
interpretation
that
petitioner's
suggest,
namely,
that
whenever
there
is
an
opportunity
to
transmit
the
document
abroad.
this
is,
of
course,
the
most
natural
reading
of
article
1.
and
it
is
fully
supported
by
the
negotiating
history
which
indicates
the
drafters
left
to
each
state
responsibility
for
determining
when
a
document
must
be
served
abroad.
the
reporter
specifically
explained
in
the
debates
that,
quote:
one
must
leave
to
the
requesting
state
the
task
of
defining
when
a
document
must
be
served
abroad.
this
appears
at
negotiating
history,
page
254.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
notification
au
parquet
practice?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that,
in
fact,
was
clarified
in
the
report
that
was
prepared
by
the
reporter
of
the
convention.
in
this
report,
the
reporter
noted,
and
i
quote:
while
the
strict
language
of
article
1
might
raise
the
question
whether
or
not
the
convention
regulates
notification
au
parquet,
the
understanding
of
the
drafting
commission
based
on
the
debates
is
that
the
convention
would
apply...
close
quote.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
on
the
debates...
what
the
reporter,
at
this
point,
this
appears
at
negotiating
history,
page
367.
at
that
same
page,
there
is
also
a
footnote
back
to
the
debates.
what
the
reporter's
relying
on
is
on
statements
from
the
french
and
dutch
delegations
that
au
parquet
service
does
include
an
obligation
to
transmit
the
document
abroad
as
part
of
the
service
procedure.
for
example,
mr.
lef
of
the
netherlands
explained,
and
this
is
at
page
169
of
the
negotiating
history,
translated,
quote:
there
is
in
the
netherlands
a
real
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
public
prosecutor's
office
and
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
to
transmit
abroad...
close
quote.
he
also
indicated
the
situation
in
the
netherlands
is,
therefore,
quote:
almost
identical...
close
quote,
to
that
of
france.
indeed,
shortly
after
signing
the
convention,
france
amended
its
code
of
civil
procedure,
article
684
through
686,
to
eliminate
any
doubt
that
documents
served
through
this
method
must
be
transmitted
abroad.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
also
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
illinois,
in
fact,
does
leave
open
that
opportunity
under
its
corporation
law.
i
believe
that's
section
5.25
of
the
illinois
code.
but
what
it
also
indicates
is
that
if
one
serves
the
secretary
of
state,
the
secretary
of
state
is
under
an
obligation
to
transmit
those
documents
abroad.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
would
probably
be
unconstitutional
under
wuchter
v....
wuchter.
i
don't
recall
the
last
name
of
the
party,
but
that's
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
and
that
simply
indicates
that,
in
fact,
volkswagen
has
two
levels
of
protection
here.
first,
illinois
statutory
law
and,
second,
the
due
process
clause.
in
short,
there's
ample
protection.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
i
also,
respectfully,
submit
that
interpreting
the
convention
in
the
way
that
petitioner
suggests
will
not
protect
american
corporations,
either.
the
foreign
corporations
are
not
obligated
to
follow
our
interpretation
of
the
convention,
and
they
are
not
obligated
to
follow
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
convention.
in
fact,
it
appears
that
some
of
the
foreign
governments'
positions
are
somewhat
inconsistent
with
their
own
law.
for
instance,
in
illinois,
under
the
illinois
companies
act
of
1985,
section
695
does
provide
for
service
upon
an
unregistered
foreign
corporation
at
its
place
of
business
in
england.
that,
under
petitioner's
position,
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
convention
but,
nevertheless,
is
allowed.
likewise,
the
french's
new
code
of
civil
procedure,
of
section
690,
also
provides
for
service
at
a
place
of
business
or
upon
any
qualified
member
of
the
corporation.
now,
we
don't
know
how
the
french
or
the
english
courts
might
ultimately
interpret
the
convention.
we're
not
aware
of
any
decisions
from
those
courts
that
have
interpreted
the
convention.
however,
we
believe,
that
given,
in
particular,
with
france,
the
language
of
article
1
the
most
likely
interpretation
would
be
the
interpretation
that
we,
in
fact,
advance
here.
now,
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
notification
au
parquet
again
to
clarify
another
matter
of
confusion.
the
convention
does
not
eliminate
or
remove
the
notification
au
parquet.
that
method
of
service
still
exists
in
the
french
civil
code,
of
section
684
through
686.
what
it
does
do
is
regulate
that
method
of
service.
in
particular,
it
regulates
it
under
article
15
of
the
convention.
now
that
also
explains
why
there
might
be
some
confusion
about
this
question
of
where
there
is
occasion.
if
you
look
at
article
15,
it
says:
where
a
writ
of
summons,
or
an
equivalent
document--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--this
is
page
32a
of
the
petition
appendix.
and
again:
where
a
writ
of
summons
or
an
equivalent
document
had
to
be
transmitted
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
service.
in
other
words,
they
go
on
to
say
that
judgement
shall
not
be
given
unless
certain
conditions
are
met.
now,
article
15
does
seem
to
cover
notification
au
parquet,
here.
but,
again,
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
a
document
had
to
be
transmitted
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
service.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
don't
have
it
here,
but
i
believe
that
is
the
past
tense
of
the
verb
devoir.
we
note,
further,
that
there
are
no
substantial
policy
reasons
for
rewriting
the
hague
convention
to
protect
volkswagen
from
the
service
method
employed
here.
it
is
certainly
not
unfair
to
serve
volkswagen
through
instate
delivery
of
a
summons
to
wholly-owned
and
closely
controlled
subsidiary
that
conducts
volkswagen's
affairs
in
the
foreign
state.
first,
volkswagen
is
subject
to
the
illinois
court's
jurisdiction,
precisely
because
it
does
business
in
illinois
through
that
subsidiary
and,
in
fact,
the
illinois
appellate
court's
decision
reflects
this
in
pages
8
through
page
18
of
the
petition
appendix.
second,
volkswagen
has
complete
control
over
that
subsidiary
and,
therefore,
can,
and
we
believe,
has,
taken
the
necessary
steps
to
assure
that
it
will
receive
prompt
notice
of
suit.
third,
this
service
method
does
not
discriminate
against
foreign
corporations
because
it
subjects
them
to
precisely
the
same
requirements
as
any
domestic
out-of-state
corporation.
and,
fourth,
volkswagen
receives
all
the
protections
associated
with
the
due
process
clause.
this
is
as
much,
or
more,
protection
than
u.s.
corporations
receive
when
they
do
business
overseas.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
effectively,
that
is
what
volkswagen
has
said
here,
with
respect
to
its
wholly-owned
subsidiary.
our
position
is
that
a
state
is
in
a
position
to
identify
that
agent
as
an
agent
for
service
of
process,
and
that
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
some
states
do
allow
that.
others
don't.
i
think
that
one
thing
that
is
clear,
however,
is
that
the
requirements
to
become
an
agent
for
that
purpose
are,
in
fact,
very
strict.
here,
the
illinois
court
went
on
at
some
length
to
identify
all
the
factors
that
indicate
the
substantial
identity
between
volkswagen
of
germany
and
volkswagen
of
america.
i'd
like
to
address
a
few
other
points
that
have
arisen
here.
petitioners
have
pointed
out
the
importance
of
formality
of
service.
however,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
a
german
court's
jurisdiction
does
not
depend
on
service.
those
formalities
are
primarily
common
law
formalities.
this
point
is
made
in
kaplan
and
von
merin,
in
71
harvard
law
review,
at
1203
through
1204.
professor
smith's
book
on
international
service
of
process
also
indicates
this
at
some
length.
i've
already
mentioned
that,
with
respect
to
justice
scalia's
office
of
the
state
hypothetical,
that
that
situation
is
covered
under
the
english
law,
and
apparently
under
the
french
law
as
well.
while
volkswagen
says
that
the
convention
is--
excuse
me.
my
time
has
expired.
