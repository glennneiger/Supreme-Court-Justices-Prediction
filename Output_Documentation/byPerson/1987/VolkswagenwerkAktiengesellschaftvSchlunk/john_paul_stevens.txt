justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
rubin?
one
of
the
concerns
was
that
it
sometimes
hard
to
identify
an
involuntary
agent.
i
think
you
have
problems
whether
a
subsidiary
should
be
treated
as
an
agent
or
not.
but
even
if
you
apply
the
treaty
procedure
for
service
of
process
purposes,
aren't
you
still
going
to
have
that
kind
of
issue?
for
example,
in
this
case
maybe
the
service
would
have
been
perfectly
all
right
if
you
followed
the
treaty
procedure,
but
nevertheless
the
defendant
might
have
contended
that
it
has
no
representation
within
the
united
states
and
therefore
is
not
subject
to
jurisdiction
in
illinois.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
isn't
it
very
similar
in
terms
of
what
you
have
to
litigate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that
but
why
is
it
so?
i
know
you
don't
challenge
jurisdiction
over
your
client,
but
why
is
it
so
clear
that
your
client
is
doing
business
in
illinois
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
illinois
courts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
challenge
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
that
issue
had
been
raised,
wouldn't
it
largely
depend
on
whether
the
subsidiary
was
really
to
be
regarded
as
an
agent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wouldn't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
ask
one
thing
to
be
sure
i
have
it
right.
you
do
concede,
do
you
not,
that
if
proper
service
had
been
affected
on
the
german
company,
it
would
be
subject
to
suit
in
illinois?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
language
was
this
treaty...
what's
the
treaty
language
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
official
language
for
interpretation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
word,
occasion.
there
could
be
an
occasion
for
a
service
of
a
document
abroad,
couldn't
there?
what
if
you
read
the
word
to
sort
of
mean
opportunity,
an
occasion
on
which
it
might
be
done,
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
read
occasion
to
mean
opportunity,
then
there
sure
was
an
opportunity
here
and
the
treaty
covers
everything.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
don't
rely
on
plain
language.
you
think
we
have
to
look
at
history,
too.
occasion
means
necessity.
that's
how
you
read
it.
that's
nice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it
says
opportune...
where
we
can
find
it.
is
the
french
text
in
the
papers
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
says
where?
where
are
you
reading?
justice
john
paul
stevens
transmit...
it
means
must
be
transmitted,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ring,
can
i
ask
you
kind
of
a
common
sense,
practical
question,
and
get
away
from
the
language.
what
is
the
burden
on
an
american
plaintiff
if
we
should
hold
that
the
treaty...
occasion
means,
you
know...
means
what
your
opponents
say
and
this
is
the
way
to
serve
foreign
corporations
and
you
have
to
go
through
this
mailing
procedure,
is
that
such
a
big
deal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what's
involved
is
the
cost
of
translating
the
complaint,
basically?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can
see
that
theoretically,
but
i
should
think
there
would
be
competent
translaters
available.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
contested
agency.
one
of
the
issues
before
the
illinois
court
was
whether
they
were
an
involuntary
agent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
were
two
issues
in
the
illinois
appellate
court.
one
was
the
treaty
issue
and
the
other
was
whether
they
were
an
agent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
contested
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
the
long
arm
issue
one
of
service
of
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
the
long
arm
issue
one
of
service
of
process?
it's
a
long
arm
statute--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
question
there
was
whether
the
service
of
process
was
valid
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law,
under
the
illinois
long
arm
statute.
