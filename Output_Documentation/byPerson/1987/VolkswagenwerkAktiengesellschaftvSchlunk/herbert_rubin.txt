mr.
herbert
rubin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
by
certiorari
to
the
appellate
court
of
illinois.
it
presents,
we
believe,
the
gravest
issue
regarding
the
continued
viability
of
a
highly
successful,
a
real
success
story
among
treaties,
the
hague
convention
on
service
of
process,
which
to
date
has
been
recognized
and
acknowledged
to
be
a
simple,
effective
device
to
end
and
remove
what
was
a
minefield
for
litigants,
americans
abroad
as
well
as
foreign
litigants
in
the
united
states.
what
has
happened
here
by
the
decision
in
this,
in
the
court
below,
is
that
there
is
a
suggestion
which
has
been
created,
a
somewhat
cynical
suggestion,
that
service
on
a
foreign
involuntary
agent
has
been
ruled
out,
but
service
on
an
involuntary
agent
in
the
united
states
is
perfectly
all
right
and
not
within
the
treaty.
respectfully,
we
believe
that
this
is
a
somewhat
parochial
and
provincial
approach
which
is
inappropriate
in
the
area
of
contract
law
which
involves
the
world
community.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
think,
your
honor,
that
you
would
have
to
comply
with
the
treaty.
i
don't
believe
that
the
treaty
contemplates
that...
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
intention
of
the
contracting
parties
was
that
there
should
be
a
kind
of
a
hit-or-miss
situation
with
respect
to
the
service
of
process.
service
of
process
is,
i
think,
the
quintessential
element
in
the
commencement,
in
the
conduct,
of
a
lawsuit
which
cries
out
for
formality,
for
a
sense
of
very
definite
precise
kinds
of
procedures
so
that
a
party
who
is
being
hailed
into
court
is
informed
that
this
is
the
start
of
a
lawsuit,
that
this
is
the
time
when
you
have
to
begin
to
respond,
and
that
any
kind
of
actions
that
have
to
be
taken
are
being
taken,
and
that
the
idea
that
the
president
is
running
through
an
airport
and
some
papers
pushed
on
him
should
trigger
that.
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
was
not
within
the
contemplation
of
the
contracting
parties.
mr.
herbert
rubin
we
respectfully
submit
that
in
presenting
the
proposition
to
the
senate,
mr.
carney,
who
was
the
representative
of
the
state
department
who
presented
it,
indicated
in
the
broadest
terms
how
this
treaty
was
to
be
administered
and
what
it's
purpose
was.
he
said
that
for
the
purpose,
for
the
service
of
judicial
documents
abroad,
that
is,
in
cases
where
an
action
is
commenced
by
a
plaintiff
in
one
country
against
a
defendant
who
is
in
another
country;
now
the
juxtaposition
is
very
clear:
you
have
a
case
where
you
have
a
plaintiff
in
one
country
and
a
defendant
who
is
in
another
country.
mr.
herbert
rubin
that's
right
and
that,
too,
is
stated
in
the
broadest
and
most
embracing
fashion.
it
says
in
all
cases
where
there
is
an
occasion
to
transmit
a
document
for
service
abroad.
mr.
herbert
rubin
your
honor,
please,
i
believe
that
the
intention
was
clear
among
the
contracting
parties.
and,
indeed,
it
was
understood
by
each
of
the
courts
that've
had
occasion
to
rule
on
it.
mr.
herbert
rubin
it
is
not
irrelevant
at
all.
mr.
herbert
rubin
the
expectation,
your
honor--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--there
is
the
necessity
to
transmit
it
abroad,
your
honor,
because
the
party
that's
being
hailed
into
court
has
a
right
to
know
precisely
what
the
contentions
are
against
it.
mr.
herbert
rubin
well,
the
president
is
receiving
it,
your
honor,
on
the
fly.
he
is
not
someone
who
at
that
point
is
prepared
to
address
that
issue.
and
the
contemplation
of
the
treaty
was
that
there
should
be
the
formality.
that's
instinct
in
every
aspect
of
this
treaty.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
it
had
an
office
in
the
state
it
would
have
qualified
in
the
state.
it
would
have
designated
a
representative
to
receive
service--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--if
it
had
an
office
in
the
state--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--i
think
in
that
respect,
also,
you
have
a
question
as
to
what
kind
of
an
office
this
is.
if
this
is
an
office
where
you
have
a
freight
forwarder
sitting
there,
it's
not
the
kind
of
a
situation--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--well,
that's
not
the
situation,
obviously,
your
honor.
if
the
corporation
has
proceeded
into
the
state
and
set
up
a
structure
under
which
it
is
conducting...
it
has
essentially
removed
itself
into
the
state...
this
would
be
the
type
of
case,
for
example,
we
had
in
perkins
v.
benquet
or
the
type
of
case
where
perhaps
you
had
in
the
scophony
case,
where
you
now
have
moved
the
corporation
into
the
state,
you
would
have
a
different
situation.
mr.
herbert
rubin
your
honor,
the
expectation
and
intention
still
is
that
the
address
of
the
company
is
in
wolfsburg,
germany,
and
it's
anticipated
that
service
would
take
place
at
its
office.
mr.
herbert
rubin
at
its
home.
where
it
is.
that's
where
it
is.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
think,
your
honor,
i
find
it
in
terms
of
the
recital
by
the...
in
the
senate
document...
saying
that
where
the
action
is
commenced
by
a
plaintiff
in
one
country
against
a
defendant
who
is
in
another
country.
this
continues
to
be...
it
is
certainly,
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
case...
that
volkswagen
was
in
the
united
states
with
offices
itself.
the
only
suggestion
here
is
that
somehow
or
other
it
has
created
an
involuntary
agent.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
say,
your
honor,
that
the
treaty
contemplates
that
there
be
a
very,
very
significant
formality
in
terms
of
service.
and,
in
fact,
what
has
been
created
here
has
been
a
very
efficient,
a
very
simple,
a
very
mechanical
device,
which
was
the
contemplation
of
the
parties.
mr.
herbert
rubin
respectfully,
your
honor,
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
principle
is
that
a
formal
document
should
be,
was
anticipated
by
the
contracting
parties
to
be,
directed
with
a
degree
of
formality,
so
that
there
could
be
certainty,
so
that
they
could
put
the
simplicity
or
there
can
be
an
assurance,
and
that's
what
was
achieved
by
the
parties.
indeed,
that's
the
indication
which
is
set
forth
expressly
by
the
five
contracting
parties
who
are
the
major
commercial
nations
in
the
world
outside
of
the
united
states.
you
have,
of
course,
the
united
kingdom,
japan,
france,
belgium,
and
germany,
which
have
expressly
indicated
that
a
service
on
an
agent
outside
of
the
nation
is
simply
not
contemplated
here.
mr.
herbert
rubin
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
rubin
but
there,
again,
the
treaty
expressly
provides
that
there
can
be
a
voluntary
submission.
and
this
was
the
contemplation
of
the
treaty.
the
treaty
says
that
if
a
party
voluntarily
submits,
it's
one
thing.
but
there
is
no
voluntariness
here.
mr.
herbert
rubin
your
honor,
if
there
is
a
voluntary
submission,
if
there's
a
voluntary
acceptance,
certainly
that
is
within
the
shared
anticipation,
the
expectation,
of
the
parties.
but
the
shared
expectation
here
is
to
the
contrary.
mr.
herbert
rubin
to
the
extent
that
there's
a
voluntary
submission
to
the
acceptance
of
process,
that
would
be
the
case.
and
i
should
point
out
to
you,
too,
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
petitioner
is
seeking
to
avoid
amenability
to
litigation
in
this
state.
this
is
not
a
case
of
jurisdiction.
there's
no
question
here
of
avoiding
in
any
way
of
being
sued
and
responding
to
the
issues
and
having
a
full
course
hearing
on
whatever
are
the
basic
elements
to
be
decided
substantively.
mr.
herbert
rubin
well--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
that
i'm
in
a
position
to
concede
that
as
the
intention.
we're
talking
now
about
a
contract
among
parties
and,
to
the
extent
that
it
has
now
been
expressed
formally
and,
i
think,
authoritatively
in
the
notes
verbal
which
have
been
filed
and
the
amicus
brief
which
has
been
filed,
this
is
the
law
and
this
is
the
understanding
of
the
contracting
parties.
i'm
certainly
not
in
the
position
to
make
a
concession
which
is
contrary
to
their,
i
think,
authoritative
expression
of
what
their
expectation
has
been.
and
they
give
reasons
for
it,
as
well.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
think,
your
honor,
you're
bound,
you're
interpreting,
you're
construing
a
contract.
this
is
a
world
contract
in
which
the
united
states
made
representations
to
the
other
contracting
parties.
the
suggestion
is
made
here
that
the
united
states,
perhaps,
got
even
the
better
of
the
bargain
because
it
was
giving
up
very
little
and
getting
very
much.
indeed,
it
got
quite
a
bit
of
protection
for
its
citizens,
the
businesses
which
do
business
abroad
and
are
sued
abroad.
and
in
terms
of
construing
what
the
shared
intention
was,
what
the
shared
expectation
is,
i
think
that
we
have
to
understand
that
the
interpretation
given
by
these
other
contracting
parties
has
certainly
some
persuasive
effect.
and
i
think
that
was
articulated
by
this
court
in
the
air
france
case.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
believe
the
court
has
to
give
the
meaning
that
the
court
believes,
because
this
is
a
federal
question.
the
court
is
going
to
construe
the
treaty
in
the
way
in
which
it
believes
that
the
contracting
parties
intended.
respectfully,
also,
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
there's
been
a
patent
overstatement
as
to
what
the
impact
was
going
to
be
on
american
law.
again,
looking
to
the
senate
document,
it
is
very
clear
that
the
statement
was
made
that
this
will
not
make
major
changes
in
american
procedures
with
respect
to
judicial
assistance.
and
that's
all
that
was
said.
that
judicial
assistance
is
not
going
to
be
significantly
changed.
we
had
in
place
already,
by
that
time,
i
think
in
1963,
the
new
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
rule
4(i).
we
had
correspondingly
the
public
law
88-619,
i
believe
it
was,
which
became
part
of
the
u.s.
code.
and
that
spelled
out
a
scheme,
a
mechanics,
for
the
system
of
judicial
assistance.
and
mr.
amram
says
in
summary
there
is
no
change
being
affected
here
from
our
system
of
judicial
assistance.
but
then
what
was
it
that
the
other
contracting
nations
intended
and
what
did
they
carry
out
and
what
is
in
existence?
i
think,
if
i
may
just
take
a
moment
to
indicate
how
this
works.
we
say
it's
simple.
we
say
it's
efficient.
we
say
it's
uniform.
and
it's
striking,
the
way
in
which
it
works.
and
there's...
all
that
has
to
be
done
is
that
if
plaintiff
takes
his
summons
and
complaint,
if
required
by
the
foreign
country,
as
it
does
in
germany...
it's
translated,
there
are
standardized
forms
which
have
to
be
prepared
which
are
transmitted,
it's
sent
by
ordinary
mail
to
the
central
authority...
and
from
that
point
on,
free
of
charge,
without
worry,
without
care,
the
central
authority
takes
it
and
puts
it
in
whatever
channels
are
necessary
and
affects
the
service,
and
you
get
this
certificate--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--respectfully,
i
believe
that
that's
what
the
treaty
intended
and
that
is,
it
was
the
huge
mischief
and
evil
which
was
sought
to
be
overcome
here
is,
indeed,
overcome
by
this
very,
very
simple
procedure.
mr.
herbert
rubin
your
honor,
again,
on
the
basis
of
the
formal
position
taken
in
the
note
verbal
and
the
amicus
brief,
i
think
that
the
result
would
be
that
there
would
have
to
be
service
abroad
unless
volkswagen
was
actually
here.
but
that
isn't
the
case.
we're
talking
now
about
a
treaty
which
is
going
to
have
the
universal
application.
we're
talking
about
a
treaty
that
relates,
for
example,
to
a
case
where
there's
an
attempt
to
serve
an
adjuster
of
an
insurance
company
where
you
have
small
companies
that
are
going
to
be
faced
with
papers
which
are
pushed
at
them,
and
then
they
have
to
cope
with
them.
we're
talking
also,
your
honor,
about
a
situation
where,
expressly,
the
united
states
and
all
of
the
other
parties
indicated
they
intended
to
eliminate
the
involuntary
agent.
the
notification
au
parquet,
the
solicitor
general
concedes,
was
a
major
object
to
be
removed.
this
was
the
involuntary
agent
abroad.
he
concedes
that
the
secretary
of
state's
service,
which
has
been
so
common
here
in
the
united
states,
is
removed
now
and
that
such
service
has
to
be
performed
pursuant
to
the
treaty
requirements.
how
is
the
service
here
any
different--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--this
is
an
involuntary
agent
which
is
created
by
law.
and
the
court
below
merely
makes
the
general
statement,
which
i
think
is
very
difficult
to
understand...
that
it
makes
no
difference
how
the
agent
is
created.
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
how
the
agent
is
created.
if
this
is
an
involuntary
agent,
this
involuntary
agent
which
says
that
a
subsidiary
is
an
involuntary
agent
is
no
different
from
a
secretary
of
state
or
no
different
from
the
au
parquet
involuntary
agent,
except
that
it's
even
worse.
because
in
those
cases,
there
is
at
least
some
kind
of
statutory
official
duty
on
the
part
of
those
agents
to
forward
the
papers.
here,
there
is
no
official
statutory
duty.
it's
a
kind
of
an
inference,
a
guess,
or
a
conjecture.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
solicitor
general
winds
up
in
saying,
is
that
three
possible
things
can
happen.
he
says
you
don't
have
to
send
this
paper
over
to
germany,
because
maybe
the
subsidiary
will
merely
send
a
summary.
or
maybe
the
people
in
germany
will
come
over
to
the
united
states
to
look
at
it.
or
maybe
the
people
in
germany
will
put
everything
into
the
lap
of
the
lawyer
and
hope
that
the
lawyer
is
somehow
going
to
be
able
to
cope
with
it.
that,
respectfully,
is
totally
unrealistic.
the
expectation
of
everybody
here
was
that
the
paper
would
be
sent
to
germany.
that's
what
was
indicated
by
the
court
in
the
lamb
case,
that
was
what
was
indicated
by
the
district
court
in
the
alabama
case,
it's
what
was
indicated:
that
the
german
company
would
be
apprised.
mr.
herbert
rubin
your
honor,
it
certainly
is
possible.
but
we're
talking
now,
again,
in
terms
of
the
contemplation,
the
shared
expectations
of
the
contracting
parties.
mr.
herbert
rubin
exactly.
mr.
herbert
rubin
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
to
understand
that,
first
of
all,
liberal
construction
is
impelled
because
you
have
a
world
contract.
secondly,
it's
a
remedial
contract.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
certainly
will,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
think,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--the
air
france
case,
for
example.
i
believe
also
that
was
indicated
in
the
aeorospatiale
case.
and
particularly
where
you
have
a
remedial
situation
which
is
being
addressed--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--you
have
a
totally
chaotic
situation
where
courts
are
being
burdened
with
a
lot
of
ad
hoc
issues
that
they
have
to
decide
whether
somebody
is...
whether
this
insurance
adjuster
or
this
freight
forwarder
or
this
toolmaker...
an
agent.
mr.
herbert
rubin
no,
your
honor,
but
i'm
saying--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--i
understand,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--well,
i
think
because
in
this
particular
case,
all
of
the
commentators
indicated
that
there
was
in
existence
at
that
time
a
chaotic
situation
which
had
to
be
remedied,
and
that
there
was
an
expanding
area
of
transnational
litigation,
and
the
burdens
on
the
court
were
being
very,
very
heavily
tried,
and
therefore
this
was
the
quintessential
situation
for
remedy
and
the
remedy
by
this
simple
device
and
there's
no
counterbalancing
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be
used.
mr.
herbert
rubin
that's
an
entirely
different
question,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
rubin
no,
i
think
it's
totally
different.
that's
the
burger
king
case.
that,
respectfully,
is
the
worldwide
volkswagen
woodson.
that's
international
shoe.
that's
a
different
issue.
here
we
are
talking
about
the
bright
line
question:
is
there
service
of
process
or
not.
mr.
herbert
rubin
and
here
it
is
so
simply
established
by
a
certificate
which
comes
from
the
official.
it
costs
nothing.
mr.
herbert
rubin
i
don't
think
that
it
is
clear.
mr.
herbert
rubin
no,
your
honor,
please,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
here
is
not
on
the
basis
of
doing
business.
the
question
of
jurisdiction
has
to
do
with
whether
it's
fair
to
be
hailed
into
this
court.
all
of
the
tests
which
have
been
enunciated:
international
shoe,
the
burger
king,
and
the
worldwide
volkswagen
woodson
case--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
rubin
you
have
a
separate
entity.
and
this
court
has
indicated
there's
no
reason
to
trifle
with
the
existence
of
the
separate
entities
where
you
have,
which
merely
spur
and
increase
issues
which
are
unnecessary
issues
to
face.
there's
no
reason
for
raising
that
question
here
where
you
have
this
very
simple
clear,
bright
line--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--we
don't
challenge
that,
your
honor.
there's
no
issue
of
that
at
all.
if
i
may,
respectfully,
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
further
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
herbert
rubin
if
your
honor,
please:
the
question
was
raised
as
to
what
is
simpler?
where
is
the
simplification?
that
really
is
a
question
which
has
been
answered
by
the
solicitor
general.
he
concedes
that
it
is
simpler.
we
have
shown
that
it
is
inexpensive.
there's
a
reference
to
the
cost
of
translation.
i
think
that
your
honors
will
have
a
better
idea
as
to
what
the
opportunities
are
for
translation,
even
in
chicago,
and
what
costs
could
be.
the
fact
is
that
the
solicitor
general
has
conceded
that
in
1986
alone,
there
were
5,000
occasions
where
service
was
made
on
american
companies
under
the
treaty.
and
in
1986
alone,
there
were
approximately,
or
up
to,
700
cases
where
service
as
made
from
the
united
states
to
germany.
so
that
this
is
a
treaty
which
is
working.
it
operates.
in
terms,
now,
of
trying
to
weigh
why
now...
what
disadvantage,
what
real
disadvantage
is
there
to
changing
the
system
which
is
stated
by
these
five
major
powers...
major
commercial,
contracting
countries...
as
the
system
which
should
be
working.
you
have,
apart
from
anything
else,
you
have
the
considerations
of
comity.
this
court
in
aerospatiale
made
the
point
about
providing
for
a
smoothly
operating
legal
regime.
you
have
here
a
smoothly
operating
legal
regime.
the
reference
has
been
made
to
the
jurisdictional
basis
for
the
action
in
illinois.
that
jurisdictional
action
was
not
based
on
doing
business
and
the
court
didn't
find
any
doing
business.
it
was
based
on
the
long
arm
statute.
it
was
a
long
arm
type
of
situation.
but,
again,
we
respectfully
submit
that's
not
relevant
to
the
issue
of
service
of
process
which
is
conceded
by
the
solicitor
general
to
be
a
question
of
federal
law
in
terms
of
interpretation.
mr.
herbert
rubin
pardon
me?
mr.
herbert
rubin
long
arm
has
to
do
with
amenable--
mr.
herbert
rubin
--that's
right,
your
honor.
but
the
question
here
of
service
is
a
federal
question.
it's
a
question
of
contractual
intent
and
that's
conceded
by
the
solicitor
general.
in
terms
of
contractual
intent,
the
intent
was
to
go
to
create
a
bright
line.
and
there's
no
reason
which
has
been
advanced
here,
there's
nothing
which
weighs
on
the
other
side,
to
depart
from
the
bright
line
which
is
feasible,
which
has
worked
as
we
see
here
by
these
statistics,
and
which
was
the
specific
intention
of
the
parties.
the
indication
to
the
senate
at
the
time
that
the
senate
was
presented
with
this
treaty...
the
senate
was
told
that
this
doesn't
essentially
change,
there's
no
major
change,
with
respect
to
judicial
assistance.
and
that's
what
mr.
amram
said.
he
didn't
say
anything
more
than
that.
