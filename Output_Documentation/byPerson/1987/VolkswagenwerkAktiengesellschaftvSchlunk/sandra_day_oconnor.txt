what
page?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
ring,
if
your
interpretation
is
correct,
though,
there
would
be
no
reason
why
france
couldn't
return
to
its
system
of
notification
au
parquet.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
none
whatsoever.
they're
not
bound
by
our
due
process
requirement
and
there
is
no
due
process
requirement
written
into
the
hague
convention.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
and
that
was
exactly
one
of
the
things
that
we
had
an
interest
in
eliminating
and
motivated
us
to
participate
in
the
hague
convention.
we
didn't
like
that
method
of
service
of
american
companies
in
france.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
all
right,
except
if
your
interpretation
of
this
treaty
is
correct,
the
french
can
go
back
to
their
old
system.
nothing
would
prevent
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
agree
that
one
of
our
goals
and
purposes
in
entering
into
this
treaty
was
to
eliminate
that
notification
au
parquet.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
agree
that
we
were
also
concerned
about
inadequate
methods
of
service
and
notification
on
american
companies
abroad?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
can
you
cite
to
indicate
that
other
members,
signing
parties
to
the
treaty,
agree
with
your
interpretation
of
it?
the
briefs
filed
with
us
in
this
case
indicate
they
don't
agree
with
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
can't
take
the
failure
to
file
a
brief
here
as
agreement
with
you.
i
wondered
if
you
had
anything
you
could
cite?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
germany
takes
the
position,
i
gather,
that
if
you
don't
follow
the
haque
service
convention
in
your
service,
that
even
if
a
judgement
is
obtained
it
won't
be
enforceable
in
germany?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
isn't
the
french
language
exactly,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
due
process
isn't
going
to
protect
american
companies
abroad
from
other
state's,
member
state's,
rules.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
are
you
reading?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
and
it
concerns
the
scope
of
an
international
treaty
called
the
hague
service
convention.
the
convention
prescribes
what
methods
may
be
use
to
serve
process
when
there
is
occasion
to
transmit
a
document
for
service
abroad.
petitioner
argues
that
the
convention
applies
to
this
case
and
that
the
service
of
process
was
invalid
because
it
was
not
in
accord
with
the
convention.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
reject
petitioner's
argument
and
affirm
the
judgment
below.
although
the
petitioner
is
a
foreign
corporation,
it
owns
a
subsidiary
registered
to
do
business
in
illinois
and
petitioner
was
served
properly
by
substituted
service
on
its
subsidiary.
under
illinois
law,
this
service
did
not
require
official
transmission
of
documents
to
the
petitioner
abroad.
therefore,
the
hague
service
convention
does
not
apply.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
have
joined.
