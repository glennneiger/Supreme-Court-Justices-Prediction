mr.
rubin,
what
if
volkswagen
germany
had
an
office...
that's
the
next
question...
in
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
this
is
a
state
that
doesn't
have
such
a
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
has
an
office
in
the
state.
that's
all.
it
hasn't
designated
anybody
as
an
agent,
but
it
has
an
office
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
this
is
a
big
office.
this
is
an
office
that
engages
in
the
full
line
of
the
business
that
the
parent
company
does
in
germany.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
moved
there.
there
still
is
a
german
corporation.
they
do
a
lot
of
business
in
germany,
most
of
their
business
in
germany,
but
they
have
a
full-fledged
office
in
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
it's
incorporated,
is
that
it?
it
has
to
be
at
its
head
office?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
find
that
in
the
language
of
the
treaty
where
there
is
an
occasion
to
make
service
abroad?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rubin,
that
brings
up
an
issue.
you've
quoted
from
the
senate
debate
on
the
treaty.
what
is
the
situation
if
we
think
the
treaty
is
clear,
that
the
language
is
clear,
and
let's
even
say
all
the
other
parties
have
interpreted
it
that
way.
so,
we
think
what
the
treaty
really
means
is
x.
but
we
find
in
the
senate
ratification
debates,
that
the
executive
has
simply
misrepresented
the
treaty,
and
the
senate
thinks
the
treaty
means
y,
what
are
we
bound
by?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
answer
my
question?
do
we
give
the
treaty
what
we
think
was
its
meaning
despite
what
we
know
congress
thought
it
meant,
or
the
opposite?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
french
text?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
french
text?
what
is
the
french
word?
how
does
it
read?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
do.
does
anybody
have
it
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
says
necessite,
you're
in
good
shape,
aren't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
want
the
french
text
interpreted.
i
assume
the
english
text
interprets
the
french
text.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ring,
do
you
agree
with
the
sg's
position
that
this
treaty
did
eliminate,
however,
two
things:
one,
the...
what's
it
called...
french
practice,
notification
au
parquet,
which
is
sort
of
you
just
serve
some
functionary
in
france
and
can
sue
anybody
by
doing
that.
do
you
agree
that
it
eliminates
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
answer.
does
it
eliminate
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
how
come
it
eliminates
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
good
reason
why
it
ought
to
be
eliminated.
but
why
does
the
text
of
it
eliminate
that
but
not
eliminate
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it
says
somewhere
in
the
treaty
that
it
can
affect
internal
french
requirements
as
to
what's
needed
to
get
proper
service
but
not
internal
united
states
requirements?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
and
i
assume
that
we
were
fearful
of
that,
too.
but
i
can't,
for
the
life
of
me,
figure
out
how
it
reaches
the
one
but
doesn't
reach
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
reach
that,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
distinction
hinges
upon
the
assumption
that
the
french
practice
requires,
for
its
effectiveness,
that
the
french
functionary
transmit
the
document.
and
that's
being
contested
by
mr.
rubin.
are
you
certain
that
the
french
practice--
justice
antonin
scalia
any
agent?
i'm
a
little
uncomfortable
just
talking
about
agency
in
the
abstract.
can't
you
be
an
agent
for
some
purposes
and
not
an
agent
for
others?
don't
you
have
to
be
an
agent
for
the
purpose--
justice
antonin
scalia
when
the
french
do
that...
how
can
you
strike
down
the
french
practice?
that
is
what
troubles
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
nice.
what
do
you
mean
based
on
the
debates.
is
it
in
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
your
position
is
that
it
covers
any
situation
in
which
under
the
domestic
law
the
document
must
be
transmitted
abroad.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
assert
that
there
is
no
necessity
under
the
domestic
law
of
illinois
here
for
the
agent
to
transmit
the
complaint
to
his
principal?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you...
i
don't
know
whether
you
have
it
handy
now,
but
i'd
be
curious
to
whether
the
phrase:
had
to
be
transmitted
abroad,
there
is
in
the
french,
using
the
verb
devoir.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
what
purpose
are
they
an
agent?
suppose
i
appoint
someone
an
agent
and
i
say:
you're
an
agent
for
everything
except
receipt
of
service
of
process.
i
do
not
want
you
to
be
an
agent
for
that
and
i
forbid
you
to
transmit
to
me
any
process
you
receive
on
my
behalf?
would
this
illinois
provision--
