h.
rehnquist
mr.
rubin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
dramatic
departure
then
from
the
way
process
is
ordinarily
served
on
corporations
outside
of
the
treaty
where,
you
know,
you
have
to
serve
some
human
individual
every
time
when
you
are
serving
a
corporation.
and,
certainly,
and
you
say
then
that
the
treaty
just
has
dramatically
changed
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
the
necessary
reading
of
that
language
at
all,
it
seems
to
me.
where
there
is
occasion
to
transmit
a
judicial
or
extrajudicial
document
for
service
abroad.
now,
you
can
argue
that
simply
doesn't
deal
with
the
situation
or
it
is
possible
under
standard
rules
to
serve
the
person
by
an
agent
in
this
country.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
look
for
the
shared
expectations
and
the
contemplation
of
the
parties
at
the
instrument
that
they
adopted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
just
quoted
you
language
from
the
instrument
that
doesn't
at
all
bear
out
what
you
say
about
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
just
a
minute,
mr.
rubin.
i'm
about
to
ask
you
a
question,
if
you'll
slow
down
long
enough
for
me
to
ask
it.
will
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority
for
the
proposition
that
liberal
construction
is
impelled
in
this
particular
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
a
case
authority.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
a
remedial
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
suggesting
there
is
some
situations
where
treaties
are
made,
or
laws
are
passed,
that
not,
quote,
remedial,
close
quote?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
congress
doesn't
act
unless
they
think
there's
something
that
needs
a
remedy,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
is
one
situation
different
from
another
so
that
you
would
say
one
situation
is
a
remedial
situation
whereby
inference,
perhaps,
another
situation
is
not
a
remedial
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rubin.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
ring.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ring.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
says:
doit,
which
is
from
devoir.
meaning
should
or
ought,
not
must.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
illinois
simply
says:
you
can
serve
this...
when
you
want
to
serve
volkswagen
germany,
you
can
serve
the
secretary
of
state
right
here
in
springfield?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
illinois
says,
hypothetically,
you
may
serve
the
secretary
of
state
here
in
springfield
and
he'll
post
a
notice
on
the
door.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
a
matter
of
due
process
and
not
of
service?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
rubin,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rubin.
your
time
is
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-1052,
volkswagenwerk
aktiengesellschaft
versus
schlunk
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
