mr.
jack
samuel
ring
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
the
hague
convention
for
service
abroad
does
not
render
invalid
service
in
a
foreign
corporation
within
the
united
states
when
such
service
complies
with
due
process.
the
heart
of
the
issue
before
this
court
is
the
interpretation
of
the
hague
convention
on
service
abroad,
regarding
service
in
a
foreign
corporation
doing
business
in
illinois,
which
it
owned
and
so
closely
controlled.
it
is,
therefore,
necessary
to
look
first
at
the
convention
which
is
clear
with
regard
to
its
scope.
article
1
of
the
convention
states:
the
present
convention,
and
i
quote,
shall
apply
in
all
cases,
in
civil
or
commercial
matters,
where
there
is
occasion
to
transmit
a
judicial
or
extrajudicial
document
for
service
abroad.
if
the
drafters
of
this
convention
had
intended
the
convention
to
be
an
exclusive
method
for
service
upon
foreign
nationals,
regardless
of
their
presence
and
their
shores,
then
i
believe
article
1
would
have
simply
read:
the
present
convention
shall
apply
in
all
cases,
in
civil
or
commercial
matters,
involving
foreign
nationals.
clearly,
if
the
framers
would
not
have
intended
this
treaty
to
apply
to
all
foreign
nationals,
they
would
never
have
used
the
clause:
where
there
is
occasion
to
transmit
a
judicial
document
for
service
abroad.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
the
treaty,
you
mean
the
negotiating
treaty?
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
french
and
english.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
i
would
say
that
there's
an
opportunity
to
serve
abroad.
there
is
an
opportunity
to
serve
here.
if
there
is
an
opportunity
to
serve
here--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--i
read
occasion
to
be
necessity.
you
have
to
look
at
the
intent
and
purpose.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
i
read
it
as
necessity
because
you
have
to
look
at
the
negotiations,
the
legislative
history,
the
intent,
the
purpose
that--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--the
french
text,
i
think,
is
it
would
be
a
necessity.
i
don't
think...
i'd
say...
if
it's
an
opportunity--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--i
don't
understand
french,
but
i--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--i
would
assume
the
french
interpretation
might
be
the
same
as
ours.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
yeah,
if
it's...
it
would
be.
i
think
that's
close
enough
to
english
that
i
could
understand.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
i
think
the
french
text,
it
says
here--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--i'm
reading,
your
honor,
from
the
solicitor
general
brief,
who
i
believe
has
been
able
to
get
the
french
text
interpreted
for
us.
and
i
think
they
refer
there--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--page,
justice
o'connor,
14.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
well,
i
hope
so.
i'm
relying,
justice,
on
matching
the...
solicitor
general
being
able
to
interpret
the
french.
the
negotiations,
unfortunately,
were
in
french
and--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--must
be
transmitted?
only
for
the
purpose
of
making
service
when
service
cannot
be
made
in
our
shores.
the
intent
of
the
convention,
your
honor,
was
to
provide
a
method,
facilitate
a
method,
for
service
abroad.
not
with
regard
to
domestic
service.
we
had
no
problem
with
domestic
service.
it
was
our
problem
to
find
a
method
to
facilitate
transmitting
a
document
overseas.
the
definition
of
service
abroad
is
not
defined
in
the
convention.
however,
it
states
that
it
means
a
formal
delivery
of
a
document
to
a
defendant
in
a
contracting
country.
now,
if
you
don't
have
to
make
a
transmissal
of
service
overseas
and
you
don't
have
to
make
it
abroad,
then
you
don't
have
to
use
the
convention.
it
is
as
clear
as
that.
the
purpose
of
the
convention
was
to
facilitate
a
manner
so
that
we
could,
in
fact,
serve
defendants
overseas
who
had
no
presence
in
our
shores.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
justice,
correct,
in
serving
overseas.
because
our
difficulty
was
not--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
it
wouldn't
simplify
it.
no.
you're
right,
justice.
i'm
sorry.
so
the
purpose,
when
you
look
at
all
of
the...
i
couldn't
agree
more
with
the
petitioner...
when
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
legislatures,
the
senate
committees,
and
the
u.s.
negotiators,
it
was
never
the
intent
of
our
country
to
give
up
the
domain
of
the
several
states
laws.
it
was
never
intended
to
deprive
our
states,
courts,
and
in
federal
courts,
of
their
procedures
and
practice.
it
was
never
the
intent
of
the
convention
to
change
our
american
law.
it
was
never
the
intent
of
the
convention
to
change
our
internal
law.
the
purpose
was,
in
fact,
to
permit
american
litigants
to
serve
abroad,
to
serve
a
person
overseas,
a
corporation,
entity,
or
individual,
who
had
no
presence
here
and,
likewise,
to
give
our
friends
in
europe
and
other
members
of
the
convention...
which
i
think
there
are
thirty...
the
same
privilege,
the
same
right,
to
sue
americans
and
give
them
notice
over
here
of
litigation
when
it
was
pending
abroad.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
i
agree
that...
i
can't
pronounce
it
as
you
do,
justice...
but
i
do
agree
that
the
purpose
of
the
convention,
it
was
a
fair...
and
that's
why
article
15
and
article
16
were--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--yes.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
yes.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
yes,
it
does.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
because
prior
to
this
time,
there
was
no
due
process
built
into
the
notification
au
parquet
as
we
have
in
secretary
of
state
service.
we
have
that
embedded
in
our
particular
statute
so
that
there
would
be
an
extra
requirement
of
due
process.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
because
it
had
no
affect
on
our
own
domestic
policies
of
service
of
process.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
the
purpose
of
the
notification
au
parquet,
the
purpose
of
the
treaty
for
the
civil
law
countries,
was
because
they
were
fearful
that
unless
they
had
some
kind
of
protection
that
the
french,
who
are
using
notification
au
parquet,
might,
in
fact,
obtain
judgements
without
giving
notification.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
it
would
reach
our
secretary
of
state
service.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
it
would
if--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--if
only...
if
we
had
a
secretary
of
state
statute
which
provided
for,
which
would
have
to
have
for
due
process,
a
requirement
to
give
it
extra
step...
if
that
extra
step
of
mailing
could
not
be
done
in
our
shores,
yes,
we
would
have
to
use
the
convention.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
on
our
shores,
i'm
saying
we
would
not
have
to
use
the
convention.
if,
in
fact,
we
had
a
mailing
required
to
go
to
a
corporation
at
its
principle
place
of
business,
or
where
he's
incorporated,
and
that
place
was
in
a
foreign
country,
yes,
we
would
have
to
use
the
convention.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
the
french
have
recently
changed
their
law
in
that
they
now
require
that
there
be
a
transmission...
i'm
not
sure
of
the
complete
language
requirements
of
the
french
law...
but
if
there
would
be,
in
the
same
method,
if
they
had
to
send
over
that
transmittal
to
the
united
states,
if
there
was
no
agent
over
there
which
they
could
serve,
then,
yes,
it
would
have
to
go
through
the
convention.
in
the
same
way
that
our
secretary
of
state
process
would
have
to
be
through
the
convention
if
there
was
no
way
of
making
that
second
mailing
on
our
shores.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
well,
first
of
all--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--that's
true.
they
could
go
back
and
do
that
if
they
wanted
to.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
the
french
have
recently
changed
the
notification
au
parquet--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--we
have
no
control
over
their
internal
law.
they
have
no
control
of
our
internal
law,
nor
should
they
have
a
right
to
determine
our
internal
law.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
no.
our
interest,
our
interpretation,
our
desire,
was
to
find
a
method
where
we
could
have
service
abroad
because
we
were
having
difficulty
finding
a
procedure.
rule
4(i)
started
the
process
in
our
federal
courts
where
we
were
trying
to
find
a
method
by
mailing.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
there's
no
question
about
it.
but
the
fact
is
there
are
approximately
thirty
countries
which
are
members
of
this
convention,
and
most
of
them,
the
majority,
more
than
the
majority
entered
the
convention
for
the
purpose
of
having
this
protection
against
notification
au
parquet.
that
would
mean,
i
would
say,
that
the
majority
of
those
countries
agree
with
us.
france
would
be
the
only
one
that
might
take
your
position
on
this.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
there
are
only
four
countries...
there
are
thirty
countries,
i
understand,
who
are
contracting
parties.
and
none
of
them
has
stated
any
objection.
if
you
use
that
kind
of
logic,
i
would
say
the
majority
agree
with
us.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
all
i
can
say
is
i
have
to
use
common
sense,
and
i
would
say
that
if
they
really
objected
strongly
they
would
have
possibly
also
filed
briefs,
as
some
of
the
countries
did
in
deciding
nationale.
i
also
might
add
that
because
these
are
diplomatic
notes,
and
i'm
not
an
international
lawyer
by
any
means...
i
would
say
that
we
don't
know
how
the
courts
of
these
countries
might
react.
whether
or
not
they
would
agree
with
the
diplomatic
notes.
and
we
also
don't
know,
justice,
what,
in
fact,
the
german
government...
and
i
had
mentioned
to
them
as
the
reason
for
their
notes...
i
say
this
because
if
you
look
at
the
belgium
note,
they
say:
based
on
what
the
federal
german
republic
told
us
about
this
situation.
i
don't
know...
i'm
not
privy
to
the
what
the
discussions
were
between
the
german
embassy
and
the
other
embassies
and,
of
course,
if
i
had
privy
to
that
i
might
have
a
better
answer
for
you.
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
have
any
more
than
that.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
well,
if
mailing
was
the
thing
that
you
would
have
to
worry
about
alone,
i
think
that
would
be
fine.
but
there
is
a
problem
in
this
case.
there
was
some
question
about
my
wisdom
in
not
using
the
convention.
if
you
consider,
justice,
that
it
cost
me
$42.00
to
file
my
suit...
i
mean,
forget
service
cost...
on
volkswagen,
if
i
had
to
get
the
translation,
which
is
a
requirement
of
article
5
of
the
convention,
it
would
have
cost
me,
for
a
42-page
complaint,
$2,500
to
$3,000.
that's
common
sense
to
me
because
that's
my
client's
money.
it's
my
money.
i'm
trying
to
do
the
best
i
can
for
my
client.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
very
expensive.
and
there's
also
another
problem,
justice.
let's
assume
that
i
were
to
use
the
convention...
and
this
happened...
germany,
by
the
way,
has
three
central
authorities.
they
are
the
only
nation
that
has
requirements
of
those
procedures.
most
countries
don't
have
a
central
authority
and
some
do.
there's
some
confusion
with
that.
however,
if
the
central
authority
which
receives
your
particular
request
determines
that
they
can't
understand
the
translation
and
because
i
wasn't
able
to
get
a
real
good
interpreter,
unfortunately,
who
didn't
know
law,
then
the
fact
would
be
that
they
would
return
it
to
me.
that
would
mean,
under
our
illinois
law,
i
have
a
thirty-day
summons
life.
and
that
cannot
be
changed
by
a
clerk,
as
the
petitioner
suggests,
or
a
judge.
because
our
rule
and
procedure
do
not
provide
for
extension
of
the
life
of
the
summons.
that
would
mean
that
each
time
that
it
would
be
returned,
i
would
have
to
go
through
the
same
process,
more
expense
with
translation,
and
have
that
sent
back
to
the
consular,
or
whoever
is
going
to
be
the
central
authority,
and
see
if
they'll
accept
it
this
time.
there's
problems
that
would
come
into
a
practical
situation.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
well,
i
can
show
you
that
we
have
seen
documents
where
they
have
been
returned.
there's
nothing
to
stop
them...
any
country...
from
rejection.
what's
left
for
us
for
relief
under
these
situations
is
diplomatic
channels.
now,
that's
going
to
be
very
intimidating
to
a
lawyer
in
a
small
town
who
has
all
of
a
sudden--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--like
chicago,
justice.
right.
and
i
think
it
is
intimidating
to
us,
too.
but
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
those
problems,
the
fact
that
you
might...
you
might
turn
this
convention
not
into
a
service
convention,
but
to
a
dismissal
convention.
and
i
think
that's
unfair
to
have
to
use
an
opportunity
if
you
have
an
opportunity
available
to
you,
an
alternate
method
in
your
own
country,
a
method
which
provides
you
for
the
tools
to
use
to
serve,
they
have
to
accept
that
coming
to
our
country
that
they
have
to
accept
our
laws.
we
do
that
when
we
go
over
there.
our
laws
are
not
so
difficult
to
follow.
and
i
think
that,
basically,
when
you
can
find
a
defendant,
a
foreign
corporation,
acting
through
an
agent
on
our
shores,
which
they
control
so
completely,
as
was
surely...
if
you
will
look
at
our
pages
on
the
merits,
our
briefing
on
the
merits,
pages
8
through
13...
overwhelming
basis
for
the
control
of
this
corporation.
not
only
that,
but
volkswagen
has
never
contested
agency,
in
the
lower
courts.
never
contested
jurisdiction.
never
contested
controlling
relationship.
or
that
it's
amenable
to
our
process.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
they
have
not
contest
that
in
the
record.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
well,
that's
true,
but--
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
--they
have
not
contesting
agency
now,
you
know.
but
the
fact
remains,
that
if
you
look
at
the
facts,
each
court
would
look
at
those
facts.
each
court
would
have
those
facts
before
them.
it
has
to
have
those
facts.
they
determined,
the
basis
of
that
finding,
as
to
the
control
that
the
corporation
had
over
them,
it
complied
with
due
process
as
far
as
our
illinois
law
was
concerned.
it
was
recently
calculated
that
the
notice
to
the
agent
would
be
notice
to
the
principal.
and
why
shouldn't
it
have
been.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
that's
true.
but
the
court
can
interpret
when
you
can
be
an
agent
by
the
factual
setting
for
the
acceptance
of
service.
even
international
shoe
made
that
comment.
and
the
fact
is,
in
this
case,
it
wouldn't
be
every
agency.
if
they
appointed
an
agency,
even
they
admitted
in
the
lower
court,
they
said:
if
we
had
appointed
the
agent
that
we
will
contest
the
use
of
the
convention.
on
the
appellate
court
level,
they
said:
if
we
had
appointed
the
agent
and
he
was
standing
next
door
to
the
process
server,
you
couldn't
serve
us
because
you
have
to
use
the
haque
convention.
my
feeling
is
that
that's
inconsistent.
and
it's
inconsistent
because
it
makes
no
difference
if
they
appoint
or
we
appoint
the
courts.
our
courts
have
a
right
and
a
duty
to
look
at
the
facts
to
determine
the
agency.
it
would
not
be
in
every
agency
relationship.
of
course,
it
would
be
no
question
if
they
appointed
an
agent
for
a
certain
purpose.
but
here,
i
think,
the
facts
are
conclusive
that
they
were
an
agent
for
service.
they
surely
were
so
controlled.
there
was
no
question
that
they
were
going
to
get
notice.
and
that
was
due
process
as
it's
supposed
to
be
for...
applying
rules
which
would
assure
the
defendant
of
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
getting
notice
of
the
actions
pending
against
them
in
this
country,
or
if
we
are
beginning
suit
over
there
in
that
country.
mr.
jack
samuel
ring
well,
there
are
no
guarantees
if
you
use
the
convention,
justice,
that
there's
no
full
faith
and
credit
clause
in
the
hague
convention,
there's
no
guarantee
that
they
will
enforce
the
convention,
there's
no
guarantee
you'll
get
jurisdiction
in
the
convention.
and
if
a
party,
as
myself,
chooses
to
sue
them,
based
on
the
finding
that
there
may
be
joint
and
several
liability
here
anyway,
there
may
be
sufficient
assets
of
volkswagen
in
this
country
where
i
wouldn't
be
worried
about
that.
i
think
it's
a
case
by
case
basis.
that
would
be
the
judgement
of
the
lawyer.
and
i
don't
think
that
interpretation
of
enforcement
should
be
a
basis
for
interpretation
of
a
treaty.
