mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
state
law
or
federal
law
governs
the
enforceability
of
a
forum
selection
clause
in
a
contract
between
two
private
parties
in
a
suit
brought
in
federal
court.
a
brief
history
of
this
case
is
as
follows:
petitioner
sued
respondents
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
alabama.
petitioners
asserted
the
state
law
claims
of
breach
of
contract,
breach
of
warranty,
fraud
and
deceit.
petitioners
also
asserted
a
claim
against
respondents
for
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
in
response
to
the
complaint,
respondents
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
transfer
based
on
a
forum
selection
clause
contained
in
the
contract.
the
district
court
held
that
alabama
law,
rather
than
federal
law,
governed
the
enforceability
of
the
forum
selection
clause
and
that
alabama
refuses
to
enforce
such
contractual
provisions.
the
district
court
also
expressly
held
that
an
alabama
forum
was
as
convenient
as
a
new
york
forum
if
not
more
convenient.
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
accepted
an
interlocutory
appeal
over
the
forum
selection
clause
issue
pursuant
to
section
1292(b).
the
court
ultimately
sitting
en
banc
fashioned
a
wholly
judge
made
rule
in
favor
of
contractual
forum
selection
clauses.
there
were
five
dissenters
in
the
court
below.
it
is
undisputed
in
this
case
that
the
contractual
provision
before
the
court
today
is
absolutely
unenforceable
in
an
alabama
state
court.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
district
court
sitting
in
alabama
should
enforce
that
very
same
contractual
provision.
that
issue
and
this
case
can
be
resolved
based
solely
on
the
plain
language
of
the
rules
of
decision
act
and
the
clear
command
of
the
rules
of
decision
act.
under
the
rules
of
decision
act,
the
federal
courts
are
directed
to
first
look
to
state
law
for
applicable
rules
of
decision.
if
there
is
no
federal
law
governing
the
issue
before
the
court,
the
federal
court
must
use
rules
drawn
from
state
law.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
is
a
federal
law
that
addresses
the
question
before
the
court,
the
federal
court
can
apply
the
federal
law,
assuming
it's
constitutional,
regardless
of
the
displacement
of
state
law
which
results.
the
plain
language
of
the
act
is
clear.
except
where
a
federal
law
otherwise
provides
or
requires,
the
federal
courts
are
required
to
apply
state
law.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
federal
law
addressing
the
enforceability
of
contractual
forum
selection
clauses.
nor
has
congress
expressed
a
policy
either
way
on
the
enforceability
of
forum
selection
clauses.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
new
york
law,
justice
stevens,
does
enforce
forum
selection
clauses.
however,
it
is
settled
that
the
courts
in
new
york,
the
courts
of
alabama,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
refused
to
give
effect
to
a
choice
of
law
clause
when
to
do
so
would
be
in
contravention
of
a
public
policy
of
the
state
whose
law
would
otherwise
apply.
this
court's
decision
in
griffin
v.
mckoch
which
is
discussed
in
my
reply
brief
supports
that
conclusion
as
well.
and
the
burger
king
decision
decided
three
years
ago
also
recognizes
that
principle.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
alabama
law
would
refuse
to
apply
new
york
law
with
respect
to
the
forum
selection
clause.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
new
york
law
would
govern,
assuming
there
was
no
conflict
with
the
laws
of
alabama.
alabama
enforces
choice
of
law
clauses
with
the
one
exception
that
i
mentioned.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
well,
it
really
gets
down
to
the
point
that
the
fulfillment
of
the
expectations
of
the
parties
is
not
the
only
interest
in
contract
law,
and
the
courts
of
new
york
and
alabama
and
the
court
below
recognized
that
the
public
policy
of
the
forum
state
must
be
considered
in
deciding
whether
to
apply
or
give
effect
to
a
choice
of
law
clause.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
state
law
is
concerned
with
what
the
federal
courts
do.
my
answer
to
your
question
is
that
when
a
federal
court
is
faced
with
an
issue
that
is
not
governed
by
federal
law,
the
federal
court
should
decide
the
case
the
same
way
that
a
state
court
sitting
in
the
same
state
would
decide
the
issue.
i
think
that
is
the
plan
of
the
rules
of
decision
act.
alabama's
policy
against
forum
selection
clauses
is
an
adoption
of
the
common
law
rule.
under
the
common
law,
the
parties
to
an
agreement
or
contract
could
not
prevent
a
court
from
hearing
their
dispute,
and
the
common
law
approach
also
recognized
the
interest
of
the
state
in
providing
a
local
and
convenient
forum
for
its
residents.
as
i
mentioned,
alabama
is
the
common
law
rule.
it
has
no
federal
origin,
and
that
being
the
case,
a
federal
district
court
in
alabama
should
decide
the
issue
the
same
way
that
the
state
court
would
which
is
it's
unenforceable.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
well,
that's
true.
but
under
this
court's
decisions
in
murphree
and
neirbo,
language
such
as
the
redwing
carriers
case,
the
alabama
supreme
court
that
the
parties
cannot
oust
the
jurisdiction
of
a
state
court,
the
court
has
considered
that
language
in
other
cases
and
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
when
no
federal
law
otherwise
governs,
like
there
was
in
hanna,
there
was
a
federal
law
that
governed
over
the
state
law,
that
the
district
court
should
decide
the
issue
the
same
way.
now,
obviously,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
there
are
cases
in
which
a
federal
law
controls
over
the
state
law
and
hanna
v.
plumer
is
an
example.
but
this
case
does
not
involve
simply
venue,
or
which
court
is
appropriate.
venue
is
appropriate
in
alabama
and
venue
is
appropriate
in
new
york.
this
case
doesn't
involve
which
court
is
suitable;
it
involves
whether
state
law
or
federal
law
governs
the
enforceability
of
a
party's
choice
between
two
suitable
courts
in
a
contract.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
first
of
all,
the
court
below
did
not
base
their
decision
to
transfer
on
1404(a).
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
i
don't
think
so,
and
for
this
reason.
first,
to
give
effect
to
a
forum
selection
clause
under
1404(a)
would
mean
that
you're
allowing
federal
law
to
control
after
you've
determined
that
the
rules
of
decision
act
says
that
under
state
law,
the
clause
is
not
enforceable.
on
the
other
hand,
should
the
court
believe
that
the
contractual
provision
should
be
considered
by
the
court,
it
should
not
be
given
conclusive
effect
like
respondents
ask
the
court
to
do.
this
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized
that
the
district
court
must
retain
flexibility
in
ruling
on
section
1404(a)
motions.
this
individualized
case
by
case
consideration
of
convenience
and
fairness
militates
against
a
per
se
rule
such
as
the
one
that
respondents
offer
in
this
case.
they've
lost
on
the
1404
convenience
issue.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
order
by
the
district
court
is
a
short
one
but
in
his
finding
that
alabama
was
as
convenient
forum
as
a
new
york
forum,
he
did
not
say
in
his
order
whether
he
considered
the
forum
selection
clause
issue
in
making
that
determination
of
convenience.
i
think
that
the
forum
selection
clause
issue
really
goes
to
the
section
requirement
under
1404(a)
of
the
interest
of
justice.
and
the
district
court
did
not
need
to
reach
that
question
since
he
found
that
alabama
was
a
convenient
forum
and
respondents
did
not
seek
an
interlocutory
appeal
on
the
1404(a)
issue.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
interest
of
justice?
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
yes,
sir,
i
think
that
there
must
be
a
finding
of
convenience
in
the
parties
of
interest,
and
further
convenience
of
the
parties
and
witnesses,
and
further
that
it
be
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
support
a
transfer,
and
i
rely
on
ex
parte
collett.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
well,
you
can--
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
--no,
sir,
i'm
contending
that
you've
got
to
have
both.
i
think
this
court's
said
you've
got
to
have
both,
convenience
of
the
parties
and
witnesses,
and
in
the
interests
of
justice,
is
the
way
i
understand
section
1404(a).
as
i
mentioned,
there
is
no
federal
law
governing
the
enforceability
of
forum
selection
clauses.
congress
has
not
expressed
a
policy
regarding
forum
selection
clause.
the
court
below
therefore
was
required
to
apply
state
law
under
the
plain
language
of
the
rules
of
decision
act.
the
clear
command
of
the
rules
of
decision
act,
like
the
language
of
the
act,
also
requires
the
application
of
state
law
in
this
case.
it
is
now
well
settled
that
the
phrase,
the
laws
of
the
several
states
contained
in
the
rules
of
decision
act,
include
the
unwritten
or
common
law
of
a
state
as
well
as
the
statutory
law
of
the
state.
the
enforceability
of
forum
selection
clauses
involve
questions
of
common
law,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
common
law
approach
was
that
parties
to
a
contract
cannot
agree
to
prevent
a
court
from
hearing
their
case.
there's
no
conflict
in
this
case
between
any
federal
law,
including
the
venue
statutes,
and
alabama's
laws
and
policy
against
forum
selection
clauses.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
justice
kennedy,
the
district
court
held
that
the
claims
that
were
not...
the
non-contract
claims
could
not
be
transferred
to
new
york,
even
if
the
others
could,
which
he
said
they
couldn't,
either.
the
second
circuit
in
the
bense
case,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
in
this
case
have
held
that
all
claims
could
be
transferred
to
the
chosen
forum.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
holding
the
retention
of
claims.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
well,
i
don't
think
that's
the
strongest
point
of
his
order,
but
i'm
just
not
aware
of
any
cases
other
than
the
bense
case
out
of
the
second
circuit
and
this
one.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
anyway,
alabama's
law
is
an
adoption
of
the
common
law
policy.
much
of
the
law
of
contracts,
including
the
enforceability
of
forum
selection
clauses,
is
shaped
by
the
common
law
and
announced
by
the
state
courts.
the
court
below,
however,
not
based
on
section
1404(a),
they
simply
fashioned
a
wholly
judge-made
rule
in
favor
of
forum
selection
clauses.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
that's
correct,
unless
the
federal
arbitration
act
applies.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
right.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
that's
right.
i'm
glad
you
brought
the
arbitration
context
up.
this
case
is
very
analogous
to
the
bernhardt
case
decided
by
the
court
in
the
'50s.
mr.
bernhardt
sued
for
breach
of
an
employment
contract
in
the
vermont
state
court.
the
defendant
removed
it
to
federal
court.
the
district
court
held
that
vermont
law,
rather
than
federal
law,
governed
the
enforceability
of
the
forum
selection
clause,
and
the
second
circuit
held,
well,
this
is
merely
a
procedural
question,
therefore,
federal
law
governs.
this
court
granted
the
writ
and
held
that
under
the
rules
of
decision
act
in
erie,
state
law
governed.
the
court
held
it
would
be
an
inequitable
administration
of
the
law
of
the
state
to
allow
vermont
law
to
prevail
only
in
the
state
court
and
not
in
the
federal
court
when
there
was
no
conflict.
in
bernhardt,
the
federal
arbitration
act
had
already
been
passed,
so
congress
had
expressed
a
policy
in
favor
of
arbitration,
but
the
act
did
not
apply
to
the
case
before
it,
because
it
didn't
involve
an
interstate
or
maritime
transaction.
it's
also
interesting
to
note
that
the
rationale
behind
the
common
law
approach
against
arbitration
clauses
is
the
same
rationale
that's
behind
forum
selection
clauses,
and
that
is,
parties
cannot
agree
in
a
contract
to
prevent
a
court
from
taking
jurisdiction
or
to
hear
the
case.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
that's
what
they
said,
but
i
don't
seen
anywhere
in
the
venue
statutes
that
address
this
question.
venue
is
proper
in
alabama
and
it's
proper
in
new
york.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
well,
the
appropriate
venue
is
determined
by
the
venue
statute.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
yes,
sir.
but
we
must
remember,
justice
white,
that
the
federal
courts
did
not
have--
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
--well,
i
submit
that,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
your
analysis
is
wrong,
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
that
in
vandusen,
the
court
held
that
under
1404(a),
where
the
case
may
have
been
brought,
and
the
court
says
you
determine
that
question
by
looking
at
the
venue
statute.
we've
got
to
remember
that
the
federal
courts
do
not
have
unlimited
power.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
a
federal
law
to
override
the
state
law.
and
there's
not.
but
i'll
assume,
justice
white,
that
let's
say
this
is
a
matter
of
federal
concern.
that
leaves
two
other
questions,
however.
the
next
question
is,
is
it
a
decision
for
this
court
to
make,
or
is
it
a
decision
for
congress.
the
enforceability
forum
selection
clauses
involve
numerous
policy
considerations.
for
example,
should
this
court,
or
congress,
sanction
and
reinforce
the
great
disparity
and
bargaining
power
between
franchisers
and
franchisees?
if
we
enforce
forum
selection
clauses
like
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
become
congested,
this
court
has
recognized
that
a
state
has
an
interest
in
providing
a
local
and
convenient
forum
for
its
residents.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
no,
sir,
we
had
a
federal
antitrust
claim.
we
had
to
sue
in
the
federal
court
because--
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
--there's
one
antitrust
claim,
yes,
sir.
but
the
court's
held
repeatedly
that
the
mere
vesting
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
does
not
give
rise
to
authority
to
create
judge-made
rules
of
decision.
there
are
other
interests
involved
concerning
forum
selection
clauses.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
transfer
and
a
limited
record.
congress
is
better
equipped
to
resolve
the
question
in
this
case.
but
we
don't
know
if
congress
will
act.
it
may
not.
so
state
law
must
govern
this
particular
case.
we've
got
to
decide
this
case
before
we
can
go
on
and
take
some
depositions
and
go
to
trial.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
no,
sir,
i'd
disagree,
justice
white.
because
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
in
federal
question
cases,
little
lake
is
one,
that
the
mere
vesting
of
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
does
not
give
rise
to
the
power
to
create
law.
you've
got
to
look
at
the
issues.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
well,
in
a
sense.
the
court
has
very
broad
powers
in
creating
rules
of
decision
in
admiralty
and
generally
in
the
antitrust
cases
decided
by
the
court,
you
look
to
the
policy
of
congress
to
determine
how
to
resolve
a
particular
issue
before
the
court.
there
is
no
policy
by
congress
regarding
forum
selection
clauses
to
decide
this
issue,
and
the
policy
considerations
that
i've
mentioned
indicate
that
such
clauses
should
not
be
enforced
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
but
let's
look
at
the
bremen.
the
bremen
analyzed
the
enforceability
of
forum
selection
clauses
as
a
matter
of
contract,
not
as
a
matter
of
venue,
not
as
a
matter
of
1404(a).
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
analyze
forum
selection
clauses
in
admiralty
in
terms
of
contract
law,
and
then
in
terms
of
venue
in
all
other
cases.
the
more
coherent
approach
would
be
to
analyze
all
cases
in
terms
of
contract
law.
the
venue
argument
asserted
by
respondents
also
creates
a
confusing
anomaly.
choice
of
law
clauses
are
governed
by
state
law
under
the
klaxon
rule.
it
makes
no
sense
to
apply
state
law
to
a
choice
of
law
clause
in
a
contract,
but
to
apply
federal
law
to
another
clause
in
the
same
contract.
when
all
is
said
and
done
in
this
case,
the
question
remains,
what
authority
did
the
court
below
have
to
fashion
a
judge
made
rule
in
favor
of
forum
selection
clauses.
it
had
none
and
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
well,
you
simply
have
a
federal
law
that
applies.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
you'd
apply
federal
law.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
that's
right.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
sure,
but
there's
no
federal
law
governing
enforceability
of
forum
selection
clauses,
except
this
venue
argument.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
f.
a.
flowers,
iii
i
want
to
address
three
basic
points
in
respondent's
argument.
respondent's
argument
reduces
itself
to
three
basic
propositions.
one
that
the
federal
court
had
federal
question
jurisdiction
because
of
the
antitrust
claim.
it's
been
settled
since
april
25,
1938,
that
the
mere
vesting
of
jurisdiction
in
federal
courts
does
not
give
rise
to
authority
to
fashion
federal
law.
that's
right.
if
it's
controlled.
if
the
issue
before
the
federal
court
is
controlled
by
federal
law
or
policy,
sure.
you
fashion
federal
law.
but
when
the
issue
before
the
court
is
not
governed
by
a
federal
law
or
policy,
the
federal
court
should
decide
that
issue
the
same
way
that
a
state
court
sitting
in
the
same
state
would
decide.
the
second
point
that
respondents
make
is
that
the
forum
selection
clause
in
this
case
is
basically
a
question
of
venue
and
procedural
and
therefore
federal
law
governs.
they're
wrong
on
that
claim
because
of
the
reasons
stated
in
our
reply
brief.
justice
blackmun,
with
respect
to
the
burlington
northern
railroad
case
and
with
respect
to
the
byrd
case,
there
was
a
direct
conflict
in
burlington
northern
between
rule
38
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
and
the
alabama
ten
percent
penalty
law.
the
court
held
that
federal
law
governed,
obviously
correct.
when
federal
law
governs,
it
controls
over
state
law.
in
byrd,
the
court
said
three
times
in
the
opinion
that
federal
law
decided
whether
a
judge
or
jury
would
hear
the
case
under
the
"influence"
if
not
the
command
of
the
seventh
amendment.
all
of
these
cases
that
the
court
has
decided
in
this
area
can
be
analyzed
under
the
rules
of
decision
act.
the
question
of
whether
a
forum
selection
clause
should
be
given
effect
under
section
1404(a)
is
really
not
before
the
court.
they
did
not
appeal
on
the
1404(a)
issue
only
on
the
forum
selection
clause
issue.
and
we
submit
that
the
court
need
not
reach
that
question.
should
the
court
decide
to
so
do,
however,
we
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
remand
that
question
to
the
district
court
for
further
findings
on
the
interest
of
justice
analysis.
again,
respondents
want
to
have
a
per
se
rule
in
favor
of
forum
selection
clauses.
there's
a
great
disparity
in
bargaining
power,
and
their
arguments
in
the
venue
statute
simply
cannot
bear
the
weight
that
they
wish
to
place
on
them.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
don't
have
anything
else
to
say.
