mr.
scott
m.
phelps
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
answer
to
the
question,
which
united
states
district
court
will
hear
this
case
involving
diversity
and
federal
question
jurisdiction
is
an
answer
in
which
the
state
of
alabama
simply
has
no
legitimate
interest.
that's
the
first
of
four
points
that
i
want
to
make,
that
there
is
no
state
interest
that
precludes
the
transfer
of
this
case
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
1404(a).
next,
that
the
application
of
a
federal
rule
to
this
case
in
no
way
violates
the
holding
of
this
court
in
erie
v.
tompkins.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
parts
to
that
question.
and
the
way
that
i
would
go
about
it
is
i
would
say
that
if
there's
no
state
interest
involved,
no
legitimate
state
interest,
the
state
interest
as
announce
by
red
wing
carriers
is
to
protect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
the
state
of
alabama
for
a
case
that
interest
is
the
breadth
of
the
venue
statutes,
the
general
venue
statutes,
the
clayton
act
venue
statute,
and
the
statutes
dealing
directly
with
transfer.
and
then
i
would
look,
much
like
the
court
did
in
another
alabama
case
that
came
to
the
court,
burlington
norther
v.
woods
dealing
with
alabama
ten
percent
appeal
penalty,
and
see
if
the
breadth
of
the
federal
statute
covers
the
question.
and
i
think
it
does.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
no,
unless
i
misunderstood
the
hypothetical.
the
alabama
interest
would
be
not
protecting
the
insurance
company,
it
would
be
protecting
the
plaintiff
in
that
case.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
well,
i
am
saying
that.
you're
right.
in
this
case.
and
the
difference
is
i
think
the
enactment
of
a
comprehensive
scheme
for
venue,
the
legitimacy
of
a
federal
interest
on
the
other
side,
the
pronouncements
of
congress
dealing
with
transfers
in
the
interests
of
justice
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
creating
a
strong
presumption
in
favor
of
the
contractual
choice
of
forum
provisions.
and
that's
that's
the
way
i
would
distinguish
the
hypothetical
that
you've
put.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
i
think
that
i
am
citing
more
of
the
second
because
i
don't
see
it
quite
as
distinct
in
two
questions
as
the
chief
justice
has
put
it.
rather,
i
see
it
as
the
transfer
statute
says
for
the
interests
of
the
parties
and
for
the
witnesses
and
in
the
interests
of
justice,
a
transfer
can
be
made
between
various
districts.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
the
eleventh
circuit
relied
solely
on
the
notion
that
venue
is
inherently
a
matter
of
federal
concern,
which
i
think
is
equally
a
good
position.
but
again,
i
never
separated
in
the
way
that
either
the
court
has.
when
we
came
to
the
court
originally
to
transfer
the
case,
we
filed
a
motion
under
1404(a).
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
because
of
his
presumption
that
alabama
law
applied.
once
you
decide
to
enforce
the
forum
selection
clause,
you
then
go
to
the
next
step
of
what
is
the
power
then
for
the
court,
the
district
court,
to
actually
make
the
transfer.
and
that
power
is
under
1404(a)
or
1406(a)
which
is
for
improper
venue.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
i
don't
think
that
they
ever
really
addressed
1404,
actually.
they
absolutely--
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
--tjoflat
did
in
the
concurring
opinion.
that's
right.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
i
would
presume
so,
yes,
sir.
the
majority
simply
discussed
the
federal
interest,
the
federal
rule
in
presuming
that
the
clauses
should
be
enforced,
and
then
directed
the
district
court
to
transfer
it
pursuant
to
1404(a).
that
was
the
direction,
the
mandate
back
to
the
district
court.
the
opinion
did
not
discuss
1404(a)
except
in
the
concurrences
of
judge
tjoflat.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
it
does,
and
i
apologize
for
the
oversight
in
the
brief.
that
argument
came
to
the
court
based
on
the
alabama
ten
percent
appellate
penalty.
if
you
took
an
appeal
in
alabama
and
had
a
money
judgment
against
you,
and
that
appeal
was
affirmed,
you
had
to
pay
an
additional
ten
percent
penalty.
the
issue
presented
to
this
court
was
whether
that
applied
in
federal
courts
sitting
solely
in
diversity.
and
the
argument
that
was
made
that
rule
38,
dealing
with
frivolous
appeals,
could
exist
in
its
own
sphere
of
operation.
the
alabama
rule
was
not
limited
to
frivolous
appeals.
it
applied
to
any
appeal,
any
appeal
in
which
you
lost
having
a
money
judgment
against
you.
but
the
court
rejected
that.
this
court
rejected
that
argument,
finding
that
the
sphere,
the
sphere
of
influence
of
rule
38
in
the
appellate
rules
of
procedure
was
such
to
indicate
a
clear
intent
that
there
was
not
sufficient
room
for
a
contrary
state
law,
a
contrary
state
policy
to
exist.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
yes,
sir.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
i
think
it
helps.
i
think
it
helps
when
you
get
to
this
issue.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
but
i
was
going
to
tell
you
about
it.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
i
do
now.
i
was
going
to
tell
you
about
it.
i
do
think
so.
it
gets
to
the
issue
of
the
type
of
conflict
that
is
required
between
the
state
practice
and
the
federal
practice.
and
it's
clear
that
the
venue
statutes
are
written
very
broadly,
the
transfer
statute
is
written
broadly,
for
a
good
reason.
so
that
congress
wouldn't
sit
and
list
every
factor,
every
single
factor
which
may
be
in
or
not
in
the
interest
of
justice.
the
basic
place
that
we
miss
one
another
in
this
argument
is
on
the
basic
premise
of
what
the
alabama
policy
means
to
this
case.
and
the
petitioners
argue
that
the
alabama
supreme
court,
in
the
redwing
carriers
case
addressed
this
issue
and
forecloses
it.
and
there's
no
question
but
in
redwing
carriers,
alabama
supreme
court
considered
a
forum
selection
clause
and
elected
not
to
enforce
it.
but
a
forum
selection
clause,
when
put
to
a
state
court,
is
a
very
different
question
than
when
that
same
clause
is
put
to
a
federal
court.
put
to
a
state
court,
it
inherently
raises
questions
of
jurisdiction
because
the
state
doesn't
have
a
power,
a
method,
a
1404(a)
to
transfer
a
case
any
place
else.
can't
make
a
state
judge
in
new
york
take
it.
when
the
clause
is
put
to
a
federal
court,
it
is
solely
a
question
of
venue
which
among
several
places
where
venue
is
proper
under
1391,
should
this
case
be
heard
in
the
interest
of
justice.
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
recognized
that
distinction
in
the
redwing
carriers
opinion.
because
they
held
that
they
would
not
enforce
agreements
that
served
to
oust
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
now,
the
analysis
on
this
seems
to
me
to
be
much
like
the
analysis
that
this
court
went
through
in
byrd
v.
blue
ridge.
in
byrd,
the
question
came
from
south
carolina
of
whether
or
not
the
south
carolina
practice
of
submitting
the
issue
of
the
plaintiff's
employment
by
the
defendant
to
the
judge,
rather
than
a
jury,
would
be
binding
in
federal
court.
and
rather
than
just
blindly
following
the
south
carolina
practice
of
submitting
that
issue
to
the
judge,
this
court
analyzed
the
reasons
for
the
south
carolina
policy.
and
the
south
carolina
policy
was
related
directly
to
the
south
carolina
workmen's
compensation
practice.
and
the
fact
that
that
issue
typically
was
a
jurisdictional
issue
connected
with
reviewing
the
judgments
of
the
south
carolina
industrial
relations
board.
finding
that
that
state
interest
simply
missed
the
mark
in
federal
court.
had
no
place
in
a
federal
court
analysis.
this
court
applied
a
federal
rule,
or
allowed
the
federal
court
to
submit
the
question
to
the
jury,
rather
than
a
judge.
the
alabama
state
interest
in
this
case
of
protecting
its
own
jurisdiction
is
just
as
inapplicable
in
this
case.
this
is
not
solely
a
diversity
case.
it's
never
seen
a
state
courthouse.
it
was
filed
originally
in
federal
court.
because
of
the
exclusive
nature
of
the
sherman
act
claims,
it
couldn't
be
filed
in
state
court.
the
alabama
state
policy
just
doesn't
apply.
in
addition
to
the
venue
scheme,
the
series
of--
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
--there's
nothing
in
the
opinion
that
suggests
that.
but
let
me
assume
that
that
is
a
basis.
i
mean,
there's
not
a
word
in
there
that
suggests
that.
but
if
that
is
a
basis,
this
court,
following
the
bremen
rule,
would
not
transfer
it.
the
federal
rule
would
protect
the
state
interest
in
that
sense.
the
bremen
doesn't
say
any
time
there's
a
forum
selection
clause,
you
transfer
it.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
the
good
thing
about...
the
wisdom
of
the
bremen
rule
is
that
it
matches
up
very
nicely
with
1404.
the
eleventh
circuit
did
say
the
cause
is
enforceable,
transfer
it.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
it
didn't
go
through
it
beyond
deciding
that
the
forum
selection
clause
should
be
given
a
strong
presumption.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
they
would
have
not
transferred
it.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
because
the
case
was
reasoned
by
the
eleventh
circuit
as
the
bremen
controls.
and
under
the
rational
of
the
bremen
case,
should
the
conclusion
that
you
are
reaching
be
reached,
the
case
would
not
be
transferred.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
the
district
court
made
a
finding
in
a
very
inverted
way
that
supports
that
position.
the
district
court's
finding
was
that
alabama
is
no
less
inconvenient
or
no
less
convenient
than
new
york.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
no.
i
think
what
happens
is,
under
the
bremen,
is
the
burden
is
flipped,
and
once
you
reach
the
decision
that
there
is
no
substantial
inconvenience
or
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
enforce
the
forum
selection
clause,
then
it
is
enforceable,
and
that
specific
factual
finding
by
the
district
court,
although
in
a
different
context,
supports
the
transfer.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
that's
what
i'm
saying,
is
that
they
fit
together
and
they
get
to
the
same
place.
and
it
would
keep...
it
addresses
the
question,
justice
stevens,
that
you
raised
of
protecting
the
alabama
citizen
in
the
context
of
an
overreaching
or
unreasonable
bargain
as
a
result
of
unreasonable
bargaining
power
on
the
part
of
someone,
the
bremen
analysis
would
not
transfer
that
case.
if
that
is
in
fact
the
interest
of
the
state
court,
is
protected
under
the
bremen
rule.
but
that's
not
the
interest
the
state
court
has
announced.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
no,
the
federal
court
would.
it
would
have
to
under
york,
i
would
think,
versus
guaranty
trust.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
the
analysis
in
that
cases
changes
slightly,
and
it's
like
york.
and
the
problem
there
is
that
that
particular
fact
situation
so
directly
impacts
and
controls
the
outcome
of
the
litigation,
it
makes
the
issue
of
whether
you
file
the
lawsuit
in
state
court
or
federal
court
a
matter
of
choice
where
the
result
would
be
different,
and
clearly,
that's
prohibited
under
erie.
the
difference
in
this
case
and
that
is
it's
not
like
the
statute
of
limitations
in
york,
or
it's
not
like
res
judicata
principles
that
the
court
considered
in
angel
v.
bullington.
it
simply
deals
with
means
and
methods
by
which
the
parties
are
going
to
enforce
their
respective
rights
of
in
one
another.
the
twin
aims
of
erie
as
they've
been
described
dealing
with
inequitable
administration
of
justice,
and
forum
shopping,
do
not
apply
in
this
case.
they
would
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
put.
there
is
no
inequitable
administration
of
justice
principally
because
the
parties
have
agreed
to
the
new
york
substantive
law
applied.
and
whether
the
case
is
resolved
in
birmingham
or
whether
the
case
is
resolved
in
new
york,
there's
no
showing
and
there's
no--
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
--not
in
this
case.
because
this
has
got
the
sherman
act
claims
in
it.
this
case
can't
go
the
other
side
of
the
street.
the
erie
question
was
whether
it
was
right
for
the
result
on
one
side
of
the
street
to
be
different
from
the
result
in
the
federal
courthouse
on
the
other
side
of
the
street.
and
the
forum
shopping
in
this
case,
you
never
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
street.
you
can't
get
it
to
the
state
courthouse.
the
exclusively
federal
nature
of
the
sherman
act
claims
makes
it
go
to
the
federal
courthouse.
it's
not
the
same
kind
of
forum.
you're
troubled
with
me,
i
take
it?
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
i
think
it
would.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
yes.
but
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case,
though.
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
is
just
the
analysis
with
the
sherman
act
claim.
now,
i
think
the
answer
is
the
same
in
that
case,
which
is
another
case
someday.
but
in
that
sense,
the
forum
shopping
notion
would
have
to
just
be
put
in
place
with
the
other
questions
to
be
answered.
but
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case.
the
sherman
act
claims
take
care
of
that
in
this
case.
the
forum
shopping,
it's
not
the
same
kind
of
forum
shopping
that
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
erie
but
the
forum
shopping
that
would
result
in
this
case
results
from
the
application
of
a
state
rule.
because
plaintiffs
can
always
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
they
do
that
by
coming
in
and
filing
a
complaint.
and
people
who
could
find
it
only
moderately
inconvenient,
whether
they
be
from
mississippi
or
georgia
or
whatever,
could
all
go
to
alabama
and
initiate
in
federal
court,
their
lawsuits
under
the
sherman
act.
and
solely
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
forum
selection
clause.
and
that
type
of
forum
shopping
is
equally
bad.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
absolutely.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
because
the
state
law
that
is
announced
does
not
apply.
the
case
doesn't
deal
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court.
it
shouldn't
be
blindly
followed,
which
the
court
declined
to
do
in
byrd.
the
area
of
concern
is
venue
where
among
a
series
of
proper
places
the
case
could
be
tried,
should
it
be
tried.
to
get
it
there,
it
has
to
be
transferred.
there
is
a
direct
statute
dealing
with
transfers.
it
is
sufficiently
broad
to
cover
this
issue,
and
the
forum
selection
clause
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
should
be
transferred
should
be
given
great
weight,
as
it
has
been
given
great
weight
in
other
circumstances.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
that's...
justice
scalia
was
working
on
me
about
that.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
i
think
the
analysis
is
exactly
the
same.
it
gets
to
the
same
place
because
of
the
controlling
interest
involved
in
the
federal
court.
this
is
the
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
it
just
manifestly
is
a
federal
concern.
the
state
interest
doesn't
match
up,
and
it
should
be
therefore
governed
by
the
federal
rules.
this
case
doesn't
reach
that
case.
i
mean,
this
case
you
can
solve
a
lot
of
things
by
keeping
in
mind
that
it
has
the
sherman
act
exclusively
federal
claims
in
it.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
i
think
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
him
to
do
that.
mr.
scott
m.
phelps
no.
i
didn't
understand
that
part
of
it.
i
think
it
would
be
within
the
district
court's
discretion
to
view
a
lot
of
factors
and
reach
a
decision
that
the
venue
selection
clause
should
be
ignored
or
should
not
be
given
effect.
but
the
venue
selection
clause
ought
to
be
given
a
presumption
of
correctness.
in
another
case,
justice
blackmun's
going
to
point
out
we
left
out
of
our
brief,
mitsubishi
motors
v.
solar
chrysler
plymouth,
the
citation
of
which
i
have
that
one
written
down,
is
473
u.s.
614.
and
the
reason
i
thought
he'd
call
that
to
my
attention
is
because
he
wrote
the
opinion,
the
court
indicated
that
the
bremen
and
scherk
established
a
strong
presumption
in
favor
of
enforcement
of
freely
negotiated
contractual
choice
of
forum
provisions.
and
that's
the
presumption
i'm
talking
about.
there
could
be
a
set
of
circumstances,
there
could
be
a
set
of
facts
where
it's
unreasonable
under
the
circumstances
to
enforce
the
provision,
but
that
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
court.
let
me
deal
in
the
last
couple
of
minutes
with
the
notion
of
the
facts
in
this
case
and
why
the
facts
as
presented
to
the
district
court
indicate
that
transfer
is
appropriate.
under
the
bremen
and
scherk
and
other
cases
like
that,
the
essential
test
has
been
put
that
the
burden
is
on
the
party
trying
to
avoid
the
freely
negotiated
bargain
to
prove
that
they
would
be
affectively
deprived
of
their
day
in
court.
the
burden
is
on
the
side
trying
to
get
out
of
the
contract,
get
out
of
their
deal.
and
that
burden
simply
has
not
been
met
in
this
case.
the
district
court's
finding
that
i
alluded
to
earlier
that
the
alabama
forum
is
no
less
convenient
than
a
new
york
forum
in
fact
tends
to
prove
the
opposite.
but
specifically,
what
the
court
had
to
consider
in
this
case
was
the
nature
of
the
stewart
organization,
the
plaintiff
below.
the
stewart
organization
is
controlled
principally
by
two
individuals,
walter
stewart,
who
is
a
professional
accountant,
jim
snow
who
is
a
professional
accountant,
both
of
whom
are
senior
partners
in
a
birmingham
based
accounting
firm,
both
who
have
had
a
run
a
number
of
businesses.
mr.
stewart
has
had
great
success
in
taking
businesses
that
were
not
doing
well
and
turning
them
around,
and
making
them
do
better,
which
led
to
the
panel
in
the
eleventh
circuit
referring
to
him
as
the
man
with
the
midas
touch.
there
simply
is
no
showing
that
mr.
stewart
has
been
taken
advantage
of
by
ricoh.
in
fact,
what
he
says
to
justify
avoiding
his
bargain
is,
i
didn't
read
the
contract.
they
put
it
to
me
and
they
told
me
i
had
to
sign
it,
they
weren't
going
to
change
it,
and
i
didn't
read
it.
but
that's
no
excuse
for
a
person
who
is
in
that
position
who
is
dealing
in
that
kind
of
businesses.
compare
it
to
the
szukhents
in
the
szukhent
v.
national
equipment
rental
case.
the
szukhents
were
farmers
in
michigan
who
needed
a
piece
of
farm
equipment
to
do
their
work.
and
they
entered
into
a
contract
to
rent
that
equipment
from
a
new
york
company.
that
contract
appointed
a
lady
by
the
name
florence
weinberg
as
their
agent
to
receive
service
process.
they'd
never
met
her.
they
didn't
know
that
that
provision
was
in
the
contract.
they
had
no
dealings
with
her.
they
were
as
surprised
as
anybody
when
they
received
the
summons
and
complaint
in
the
mail
from
ms.
weinberg.
but
the
court
held
the
szukhents
to
that
bargain,
and
there
certainly
is
no
basis
in
this
record
to
excuse
the
stewart
organization
from
their
bargain.
there
is
nothing
about
the
court's
holding
in
erie
v.
tompkins
that
prevents
the
enforcement
of
the
parties
agreement.
and
we
ask
that
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion
be
affirmed.
