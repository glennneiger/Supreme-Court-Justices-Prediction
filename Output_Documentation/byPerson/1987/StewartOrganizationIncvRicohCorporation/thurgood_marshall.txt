marshall
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals

we
hold
here
that
this
federal
statute
designated
as

1404(a),
governs
the
enforceability
of
a
contractual
forum,
the
selection
of
that
forum
in
diversity
actions.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice

has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
o'connor
joined.
also,
