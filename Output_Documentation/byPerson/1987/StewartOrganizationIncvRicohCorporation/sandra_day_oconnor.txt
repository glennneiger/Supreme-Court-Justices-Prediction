justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
flowers,
i
guess
at
least
one
or
more
of
the
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
in
making
the
venue,
in
deciding
the
venue
issue
that
the
parties'
contractual
provision
is
one
of
the
factors
to
be
considered.
is
that
a
sensible
inquiry
to
make
in
connection
with
application
of
section
1404,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
court
could
have?
and
that
the
parties'
contractual
agreement
should
be
a
factor
in
making
that
decision?
