justice
scalia
excuse
me.
you're
not
saying
that
alabama
would
decline
to
apply
new
york
substantive
law,
as
well?
or
are
you?
justice
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
what
about
with
respect
to
the
substance
of
the
dispute?
justice
scalia
you
acknowledge
that
that's
the
second
requirement
and
not
just
part
of
the
first?
justice
scalia
you
think
that's
a
separate
requirement?
justice
scalia
for
which
purpose
you
can
consider
any
other
factors
and
not
just
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
witnesses?
justice
scalia
that
would
make
a
big
difference
to
me,
if
you
think
that
there
are
two
reasons
why
you
can
order
a
change
of
venue,
either
for
the
convenience
of
parties
and
witnesses,
or
in
the
interest
of
justice.
justice
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
so
anomalous
to
apply
federal
law
to
some
clauses
in
the
contract
and
state
law
in
the
others.
suppose
there's
a
provision
in
the
contract
agreeing
to
shorten
the
statute
of
limitations
for
the
sherman
act,
anti-sherman
act
claim?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
the
court
would
say,
even
if
that's
permissible
under
alabama
law,
we
don't
care.
it's
not
permissible
under
federal
law.
justice
scalia
so
it's
thinkable
that
you
could
apply
federal
law
to
some.
justice
scalia
but
that's
a
different
point.
that
was
your
earlier
point.
justice
scalia
before
you
get
into
whether
there's
any
state
interest,
i
really
worry
about
importing
into
the
federal
venue
rules,
the
kind
of
choice
of
law
determinations
that
have
become
standard
in
conflict
of
laws
now.
are
you
saying
that
that's
how
we
should
resolve
erie
type
questions,
whether,
even
though
the
state
law
is
thus
and
such,
there
is
a
real
interest
on
the
part
of
the
state?
or
is
it
a
false
conflict?
you're
familiar
with
the
false
conflict?
justice
scalia
suppose
you
have
an
alabama
contract
rule
that
says
that
the
insurance
company
cannot
be
held
liable
for
penal
damages
in
any
event,
all
right?
and
the
suit
happens
to
be
between
an
alabama
insured
and
a
new
york
insurance
company,
all
right?
you
could
say
the
same
thing
that
you're
saying
here.
alabama
has
no
interest
really
in
protecting
the
new
york
insurance
company
against
penalties.
it's
after
all
an
alabama
insured,
a
new
york
insurance
company.
so
therefore
should
the
federal
court
not
apply
alabama
law
on
that
point?
justice
scalia
no,
no,
no.
the
plaintiff
wants
to
get
a
penalty
against
the
insurance
company
so
the
insurance
company
willfully
failed
to
settle,
but
alabama
law
is
no
smart
money
against
insurance
companies.
that's
the
alabama
law.
in
this
case,
it
works
to
the
detriment
of
an
alabama
citizen.
it
doesn't
further
any
state
policy
that
alabama
would
sensibly
be
concerned
with.
what
does
alabama
care
what
happens
to
a
new
york
insurance
company?
and
you're
saying
the
same
thing
here.
what
does
alabama
care
what
happens
to
federal
courts?
justice
scalia
mr.
phelps,
can
i
come
back
to
your
assertion
that
it
makes
a
difference
what
the
purpose
of
the
state
rule
is
in
determining
whether
you
will
apply
state
law
or
federal
law.
suppose
you
have
a
state
statute
of
limitations,
and
it's
absolutely
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
it,
in
fact,
it
says
it
in
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
state
supreme
court
says
it
in
the
opinion
applying
it
that
the
only
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
protect
our
courts
against
the
burden
of
old
litigation.
we
want
to
deal
with
fresh
litigation.
that's
the
only
purpose
of
it.
do
you
think
in
that
case
the
federal
court
would
not
apply
the
state
statute
of
limitations?
justice
scalia
so
then
what
difference
does
it
make
here
whether
the
purpose
of
this
state
rule
is
to
protect
their
courts
or
to
protect
their
citizens?
justice
scalia
makes
a
lot
of
difference.
do
you
think
that
wouldn't
result
in
forum
shopping
to
bring
suit
in
the
alabama
court
if
you
know
if
you
bring
it
there,
you
can
stay
there,
whereas
if
you
brought
it
in
federal
court,
you
couldn't
stay
there?
justice
scalia
well,
the
rule
that
you're
urging
on
us,
though,
and
it
is
the
first
time
i
hear
that
you
want
it
to
apply
only
when
the
cause
of
action
involves
both
a
diversity
cause
of
action
and
a
federal
claim?
is
that...
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
rule
you're
urging
on
us
would
apply
to
a
pure
diversity
claim,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
in
that
case,
it
would
make
a
difference.
it
would
be
a
forum
shopping.
