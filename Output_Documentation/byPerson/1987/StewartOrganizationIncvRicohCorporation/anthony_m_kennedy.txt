justice
kennedy
counsel,
could
the
lower
court
here,
the
district
court,
have
ordered
that
part
of
the
action
be
transferred
to
new
york
and
part
retained
in
alabama,
assuming
the
requisite
findings
had
been
made?
are
there
precedents
to
allow
that?
justice
kennedy
i
just
want
to
know,
is
there
substantial
authority
in
cases
for
federal
courts
to
transfer
parts
of
actions
and
keep
others?
does
that
happen
from
time
to
time?
justice
kennedy
i
mean,
because
the
district
court
seemed
to
be
influenced
by
that
consideration
in
its
order.
and
i
just
can't
quite
understand
that.
justice
kennedy
i
agree
that's
not
the
strongest
point
in
his
order.
