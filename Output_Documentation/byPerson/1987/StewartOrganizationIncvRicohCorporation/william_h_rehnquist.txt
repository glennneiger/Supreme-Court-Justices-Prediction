chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
86-1908,
stewart
organization,
inc.
versus
ricoh
corporation.
mr.
flowers,
you
may
begin
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
isn't
true
in
every
situation,
mr.
flowers.
cases
like
hanna
against
plumer
and
some
other
cases
say
that
in
some
situations,
the
district
court
does
not
necessarily
decide
the
case
the
same
way
as
the
state
court
would.
and
i
don't
know
that
you
fully
responded
to
justice
steven's
point
that
this
is
just
a
question
whether
a
federal
district
judge
in
alabama
will
try
the
case
or
a
federal
district
judge
in
new
york
will
try
it.
the
alabama
state
courts
aren't
involved
at
all.
chief
justice
rehnquist
wasn't
the
district
court,
though,
partly
influenced
by
his
view
that
the
alabama
law
should
be
given
controlling
significance
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
the
reasoning
of
the
eleventh
circuit
majority,
obviously
they
ruled
against
you,
really
that
there
is
a
federal
rule
here,
or
federal
law,
it's
the
venue
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
certainly
makes
bremen
against
zapata
more
relevant
if
it
isn't
a
diversity
case,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
flowers.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
phelps.
chief
justice
rehnquist
two
different
lines
of
analysis,
aren't
there?
because
one
says
there
should
be
an
affirmative
federal
rule
approving
choice
of
law
clauses,
and
the
other
just
says
there
is
already
a
federal
venue
statute
which
governs
the
question.
you
can
factor
in
a
choice
of
law
clause.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
did
either
of
the
courts
below
rely
on
that,
on
1404?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
district
court
ruled
against
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yet,
the
district
court
ruled
against
you
on
1404,
and
as
i
read
the
eleventh
circuit
majority,
they
didn't
rely
on
1404.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say
the
judgmental
analysis
the
discretion
comes
in
the
bremen
itself,
and
judge
tjoflat
would
say
it's
factoring
the
forum
selection
clause
into
1404.
you
would
reach
the
same
result,
though,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phelps.
mr.
flowers,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
flowers.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-1908,
stewart
organization
versus
ricoh
corporation
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
