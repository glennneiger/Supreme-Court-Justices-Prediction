justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
contract
certainly
is
aimed
at
controlling
which
federal
court,
if
there's
a
diversity
case,
would
try
the
case,
which
is
a
venue
question,
surely.
justice
white
what
does
venue
mean?
it
means
where
may
or
should
an
action
be
brought.
justice
white
and
the
contractual
provision
is
aimed
directly
at
that
question.
justice
white
and
so
the
party
argues
that
the
alabama
federal
court
just
isn't
the
proper
federal
court
to
hear
the
case.
justice
white
of
course,
you
could
have
had
an
alabama
forum
if
you
had
just
sued
in
alabama
courts.
justice
white
this
was
an
antitrust
claim.
justice
white
suppose
this
had
been
an
antitrust
claim,
so
you
had
to
sue
in
federal
court
and
then
all
of
the
arguments
about
diversity
and
erie,
things
like
that
just
wouldn't
be
relevant.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
it
certainly
avoids
all
the
erie
arguments
that
you
can
make,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
well,
tjoflat
did.
justice
white
i
think
the
majority
was
aware
of
that?
justice
white
well,
it's
hard
to
read...
i
find
it
hard
to
read
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion
by
the
majority
as
indicating
that
the
transfer
would
be
limited
by
1404
considerations.
they
just
say
the
forum
clause
is
enforceable
and
transfer
it.
justice
white
so
it
didn't
go
through
the
relevant
requirements
under
1404.
justice
white
strong?
strong...
it
didn't
say
that.
what
would
the
court
have
done
if
they
thought
that
the
transfer
was
not
in
the
public
interest
or
in
the
interests
of
justice,
for
example?
justice
white
how
do
you
know
that?
justice
white
well,
how
do
we
know
that
it
was
convenient
to
the
parties
to
transfer
it?
justice
white
exactly.
so
then
it
sounds
to
be
like
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
care
about
convenience.
justice
white
i
suppose
you
would
agree
if
the
validity
of
some
substantive
provision
in
the
contract
was
at
issue
in
a
federal
court,
you'd
probably
look
to
state
law,
some
state
law
any
way,
the
applicable
state
law?
justice
white
and
so
why
not
look
to
state
law
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
this
forum
selection
clause?
justice
white
well,
what
if
there
hadn't
been
a
federal
issue
in
this
case
and
the
suit
had
been
brought
in
a
state
court?
justice
white
yes.
