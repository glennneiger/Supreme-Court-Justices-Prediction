burlington
northern.
you
don't
cite
it
in
your
brief.
the
other

doesn't
cite
it.
the
only
time
it's
cited
is
in
the
petition
for
cert.--
does
it
have
any
bearing
at
all?
it
was
decided,
as
i
recall,
one
day
before
the
en
banc
decision
came
down.
justice
blackmun
a
unanimous
decision.
justice

do
you
think
it
helps
you
or
hurts
you?
justice

you
don't
cite
it?
