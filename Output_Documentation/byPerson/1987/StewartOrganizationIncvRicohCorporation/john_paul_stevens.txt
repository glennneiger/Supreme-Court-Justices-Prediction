justice
stevens
mr.
flowers,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
stevens
there
was
also
a
choice
of
law
provision
in
the
contract,
wasn't
there?
justice
stevens
and
the
parties
agreed
to
apply
new
york
law?
justice
stevens
now,
does
new
york
law
have
any
bearing
on
the
issue
we're
talking
about?
justice
stevens
if
alabama's
willing
to
apply
new
york
substantive
rules,
what
is
the
alabama
interest
in
not
allowing
the
other...
i
understand
you
say
there
is
a
rule,
but
why
do
they
have
such
a
rule
for
a
case
like
this
where
another
state's
law's
going
to
apply
any
way?
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
what
is
alabama's
interest?
why
is
there
such
a
public
policy?
what
policy
is
being
implemented?
i
can
understand
if
if
the
case
had
been
brought
in
a
state
court,
they
might
want
to
say,
our
courts
ought
to
go
forward,
but
why
does
alabama
care
whether
federal
judges
in
new
york
or
in
birmingham
decide
this
case?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question,
mr.
flowers?
i
suppose
alabama
law
would
also
oppose,
would
consider
it
contrary
to
public
policy
to
have
an
arbitration
provision
in
the
contract
for
arbitration
in
new
york,
for
example?
justice
stevens
then
the
federal
statute
would
override
that.
justice
stevens
it's
kind
of
ironic
in
a
way...
i
understand
your
point,
but...
that
arbitration
which
is
a
greater
intrusion
on
the
judicial
process
in
alabama
than
having
it
tried
by
another
judicial
forum
in
new
york
would
override
the
policy
but
this
action
would
not.
that's
because
there's
a
rule
in
one
and
there's
not
in
the
other,
is
your
point?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
you
say
the
policy
doesn't
apply.
well,
isn't
one
aspect
of
the
state's
policy
to
protect
its
citizens
from
what
it
perceives
to
be
disparate
bargaining
power
with
these
large
out
of
state
franchisers
who
cram
these
contractual
provisions
down
the
throats
of
the
local
citizens?
isn't
that
part
of
what
must
motivate
this
rule?
justice
stevens
may
i
give
you
a
converse
case.
supposing
the
suit
had
been
brought
in
new
york,
and
there
was
a
motion
to
transfer
it
down
to
alabama,
notwithstanding
the
contractual
provisions
in
the
contract
to
the
contrary,
and
the
judge
had
said,
well,
we
have
a
terribly
crowded
docket
here.
all
the
witnesses
and
the
facts
are
all
down
in
alabama.
i'm
going
to
go
ahead
and
transfer
it.
would
you
think
a
federal
judge
would
have
power
to
do
that
in
defiance
of
the
contractual
provision?
justice
stevens
even
if
all
the
interest
of
justice
factors
point
to
alabama
as
the
logical
venue
for
the
trial?
