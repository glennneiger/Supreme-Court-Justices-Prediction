all

once
we
start
doing
that,
we
are
going
to
get
into
some
trouble.
here's
my
problem,
mr.
parrillo.
if
you
say
that
you're
not
covered
by
the
statute
somehow
because
you're
not
really
the
united
states
or
you're
the
united
states
in
a
different
sense,
in
this
class
of
suit,
then
what
happens
when,
instead
of
appointing
a
special
prosecutor
as
the
district
court
did
here,
the
court
follows
our
instructions
in
our
opinion
last
term
and
first
offers
the
prosecution
to
the
united
states
attorney
and
the
united
states
attorney
accepts
the
prosecution?
it
would
still
be
the
same
type
of
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
marshall
assuming
we
rule
against
you,
who
did
we
send
the
bill
to?
i
think
that's
a
very
realistic
point.
justice
marshall
but
i
don't
think
that
the
chief
judge
has
very
much
jurisdiction
over
us.
justice
marshall
we
might
have
to
explain
that
to
him.
but
i
still
say
it's
important
for
us
to
know
who
we
bill.
justice
marshall
counsel,
where
is
the
judgment
in
this
case?
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
marshall
do
you
have
an
order?
who
were
the
parties
in
the
order?
justice
marshall
in
the
matter
of.
is
there
any
caption
in
the
lower
court
that
says
the
united
states?
justice
marshall
well,
who
put
it
in
there?
you
did?
justice
marshall
do
you
not...
both
of
you
can't
give
us
jurisdiction.
justice
marshall
do
you
agree?
