mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
by
this
matter
is
whether
the
respondents
should
be
held
in
criminal
contempt
for
publishing
materials
in
violation
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
where
no
attempt
was
made
for
judicial
relief
of
that
order.
on
november
8th,
1985,
mr.
raymond
j.
patriarca
brought
suit
against
the
providence
journal
company,
a
rhode
island
newspaper,
as
well
as
a
rhode
island
television
station,
wjar-tv,
the
justice
department
and
the
fbi.
mr.
patriarca
at
the
same
time
filed
an
injunction
motion
seeking
to
enjoin
dissemination
of
information
which
was
about
him,
which
had
been
obtained
as
a
result
of
illegal
electronic
surveillance
by
the
fbi.
that
dated
back
to
1962
to
1965,
when
the
fbi
quite
illegally
entered
into
mr.
patriarca's
father's
business,
and
they
planted
electronic
bugging
devices.
there
were
tape
recordings
made
of
those
conversations
over
those
several
years.
those
tape
recordings
have
since
been
destroyed,
but
logs
and
memoranda
regarding
them
have
been
retained.
some
years
ago,
back
in
the
seventies,
the
providence
journal
sought
to
obtain
those
fbi
materials
and
litigation
regarding
that
was
unsuccessful.
they
did
not
ultimately
prevail
in
that
after
the
matter
was
decided
at
the
1st
circuit
level.
after
raymond
l.s.
patriarca,
that's
raymond
j.
patriarca's
father,
when
the
senior
patriarca
died,
thereafter,
the
journal
renewed
its
attempts
to
obtain
the
fbi
materials,
and
those
renewed
attempts
were
successful
and
they
obtained
at
least
some
materials
from
the
fbi
regarding
these
illegally-obtained
conversations.
shortly
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
there
was
a
temporary
restraining
order
conference
where
the
chief
judge
of
the
rhode
island
district
court,
judge
boyle,
chief
judge
boyle,
had
counsel
gather.
counsel
for
the
providence
journal
as
well
as
the
wjar-tv
were
present
in
arguing
that
any
kind
of
restraint
would
be
a
prior
restraint
and
would
be
illegal.
the
government
defendants
likewise
represented
by
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
the
judge
was
apparently
very
concerned
that
there
were
paramount
1st
amendment
rights
which
may
be
or
which
would
be
impinged
if
you
were
to
enter
any
kind
of
order.
therefore,
he
set
the
matter
down
for
hearing
or
intended
to
set
the
matter
down
for
hearing
the
next
day
and
issue
a
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
no,
your
honor.
the
temporary,
restraining
order
conference
was
on
a
wednesday
at
about
12:30.
the
judge
took
a
recess
from
the
case
he
was
trying
at
about
12:30
on
a
wednesday,
they
had
this
conference.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
no,
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
i
cannot
concede
that.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
i
suggest--
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
--i
can't
say
that
either,
your
honor.
i
suggest
that
it's
an
interesting
question.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
well,
your
honor,
it's
true
that
the
1st
amendment...
any
order
impinging
is
going
to
be
presumptively
invalid.
no
question
about
that.
but,
here,
mr.
patriarca
had
filed
a
motion
and
an
affidavit
along
the
lines
that
he
would
be
essentially
suffering
a
direct
irreparable
immediate
harm
to
his
privacy
rights.
he
asserted
a
4th
amendment
interest.
perhaps
that
ultimately
will
not
prevail.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
the
journal,
in
and
of
itself,
could
not.
the
judge,
however,
was
not
certain
about
that
instantaneously
at
that
point.
in
fact,
your
honor,
within
six
days,
he
vacated
his
order.
but
at
the
time
that
it
was
issued,
he
was
concerned
with
what,
to
him
at
least,
seemed
to
be
a
novel
issue
concerning
an
asserted
constitutional
right
by
mr.
patriarca,
and
irreparable
harm
would
befall
mr.
patriarca,
and
he
had
just
come
recently,
i
guess,
within
the
last
few
weeks
from
a
1st
circuit
conference
where
this
entire
area
had
been
discussed.
there
was,
as
i
say,
the
litigation
having
to
do
with
the
prior
attempts
by
the
journal
to
obtain
this
material,
and
the
1st
circuit
at
least
suggested
that
congress
had
made
it
clear,
as
clear
as
possible,
that
invasion
of
privacy
by
illegal
electronic
surveillance
was
an
insidious
invasion
of
privacy,
and
that--
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
--that
gets
to
the
heart
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
i
just
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there's
an
interesting
issue,
and
i
don't
think
that
i
can
concede
it.
but
assuming
for
argument
that
it
were
to
be
conceded,
then,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
judge
then
made
a
mistake,
clearly
makes
a
mistake,
issues
an
order
which
is
going
to
be
invalid
on
a
constitutional
proportion.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
this
is
a
suit
that
was
originally
brought
entitled
in
the
matter
of
application
to
adjudge
the
journal
and
its
editor
in
contempt.
the
caption
was
changed
when
the
matter
got
to
this
court
on
our
belief
or
understand
that
it's
the
custom
at
the
court
anyway
to
have
two
clearly-delineated
parties.
perhaps
it
was
a
mistake
to
have
changed
the
caption,
but,
in
any
event,
your
honor,
you're
absolutely
right.
it's
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
under
a
criminal
statute,
401,
yes,
your
honor.
and
to
answer
your
question,
if
i
can
try
to
directly,
it
goes
back
to
the
inherent
power
of
the
courts
to
vindicate
their
authority
by
instituting
contempt
proceedings.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
well,
your
honor,
i
can
understand
your...
that
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
criminal
prosecutions--
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
--perhaps,
your
honor.
perhaps
it
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
that
may
be
correct
as
well.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
that's
correct.
i
suggest
one
point
is
that
i
think
perhaps
have
ratified
our
arguments
and
what
we
have
done,
we...
to
get
back
to
try
to
answer
your
question,
justice
scalia,
the
united
states,
as
it
were,
has
an
interest
through
the
judiciary
in
this
case.
i
think
we
represent
the
interest
of
the
people
to
vindicate
the
rule
of
law
in
rhode
island,
and
that's...
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
yes,
your
honor.
all
of
the
people.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
well,
the
judge
as
a
citizen,
but
not
as
a
party.
he
is
not
the
party--
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
--at
that
point,
your
honor,
yes,
it
would.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
no,
he
couldn't,
because
that
would
become
an
executive
function
once
the
justice
department
accepted
it.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
well,--
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
--he
does
not,
your
honor.
he's
confirmed
that.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
he
does,
your
honor,
and
later
in
his
memorandum
regarding
the
motion
to
dismiss,
he
says
the
same
thing
again.
it's
certainly
a
difficult
question.
i
appreciate
that.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
well,
that
statute
says
that
if
the
attorney
general
authorizes
it
first
and
then
it's
all
right
for
that
person,
but
for
anybody
off
the
street--
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
well,
that's
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general.
it's
his
position
and
our
position
that
this
is
a
judicial
function
and
that's
why
i'm
here,
in
that
we
represent
the
people,
the
interests
of
the
people
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
i
think
then,
your
honor,
it
would
be
an
executive
prosecution,
and
in
this
case,
if
the
executive,
after
the
1st
circuit,
reversed
the
contempt,
made
a
prosecutorial
decision
not
to
go
forward,
then
the
executive
need
not
go
any
further.
i
think,
however,
where
the
executive
takes
no
part
in
this
case
at
all,
the
executive
is
not
involved
at
all,
it's
representatives
of
the
judicial
branch
for
the
public
interest,
then
we're
in
a
different
situation.
and,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
there
were
a
violation
of
this
court's
order
anywhere
and
you
submitted
it
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general,
for
whatever
reason,
turned
you
down,
that
under
your
supervisory
powers,
the
court
could
appoint
a
special
prosecutor
to
appear
here.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
well,
your
honor,
the
chief
judge
authorized
us
to
go
forward
and
pay
the
expenses
to
bring
the
action.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
no,
your
honor.
only
insofar
as
you
allow
him
to.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
well,
your
honor,
i'm
here
under
young,
essentially.
either
young
v.
united
states
authorizes
us
to
be
here
or
it
does
not.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
happened
at
this
conference
was
critical,
at
temporary
restraining
order
conference,
because
the
judge
indicated
that
he
would
hear
the
matter
tomorrow,
the
next
morning,
presumably
because
it
was
of
such
constitutional
proportions.
in
response
to
that
invitation,
the
journal
lawyers
and
the
media
lawyers
said,
no,
we
cannot
go
forward
tomorrow,
we
need
more
time
to
prepare.
in
response
to
that,
the
case
was
put
over
another
day.
the
request
for
postponement
was
granted
and
then
the
violation
occurred
in
the
interim.
before
the
violation
occurred,
there
are
several
things
of
extreme
importance
that
did
not
occur,
and
that
is
that
the
journal
did
not
go
back
to
the
trial
judge
to
seek
to
vacate
or
to
stay
the
order.
they
didn't
indicate
that
they
had
so
much
problem
with
it
that
they
had
to
violate
it,
that
it
was
such
a
sense
of
urgency
that
they
couldn't
live
with
it.
they
did
not
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
seek
to
vacate
it
or
stay
it.
they
did
not
seek
an
emergency
appeal
and
the
court
of
appeals
level,
although
that
right
is
available
to
them
in
these
sorts
of
situations.
they
did
not
seek
mandamus.
they
did
not
apply,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
asserted,
to
the
judge.
they
did
nothing,
except
violate.
the
publication
was
the
next
day
of
the
matters
that
they
ought
not
to
have
published,
and
the
basis
of
our
argument
on
the
merits
is
that
courts
are
the
only
body
that
are
empowered
by
the
power
of
this
country
to
determine
cases.
private
litigants
are
simply
not
authorized
to
do
so.
the
respondents
in
this
case
seized
article
iii
power.
they
made
themselves
the
court
and
not
just
made
themselves
the
court,
but
it
was
sort
of
a
star
chamber
proceeding
where
they
didn't
even
invite
mr.
patriarca.
they
claimed
a
unique
status
in
the
superiority
to
the
judiciary
and
went
ahead.
the
basis
of
our
being
here
on
the
merits
is
that
we
suggest
that
lawful
review
is
required
and
that
walker
v.
the
city
of
birmingham
requires
that
where
there
are
facially
available
procedures
for
judicial
review,
you
must
try
to
take
them,
and
if,
at
that
point,
you're
denied
meaningful
opportunity,
then
that's
a
different
story
and
perhaps
then
you
can
later
contest
the
merits
on
a
collateral
attack
at
the
contempt
proceedings.
but
in
this
case,
there
is
no
excuse
or
no
attempt
at
all
to
proceed.
the
explanation
perhaps
may
be
that
the
journal
considered
any
question
or
any
answer
by
any
court
to
be
beyond
their
belief
in
that
they
would
not
be
beholden
to
any
court
that
might
restrain
them.
had
they
applied
to
the
district
court
and
indicated
to
the
district
court
judge
that
they
were
having
this
problem
with
the
order
and
it
was
so
serious
to
them,
he
might
well
have
averted
this
clash
and
the
ensuing
contempt
of
the
court's
authority.
i
think
the
timing
is
important.
it
happened
mid-day
in
the
middle
of
the
week.
the
courts
were
open.
the
1st
circuit
has
said
that
where
rights
are
lost
due
to
delay,
that
they
will
entertain
expedited
review.
as
the
court
commented
in
walker,
we
cannot
assume
that
courts
would
ignore
constitutional
rights
or
pleas
for
constitutional
rights,
exercise
of
those.
i
suggest
further
that
if
the
question
was
obvious,
and
justice
o'connor
perhaps
think
it
was
obvious,
that...
and
perhaps
it
is
obvious,
then
that
is
exactly
where
the
case
should
have
begun
legally,
because
if
it's
obvious
and
an
application
is
made
to
a
judge
obeying
the
law,
either
the
district
judge
being
cited
some
authority,
which
he
had
not
been
before,
although
he
asked
for
it,
or
the
circuit,
any
circuit
duty
judge
being
presented
the
question,
that
they
would
have
obtained
this
immediate
relief.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
does.
that's
the
basis
of
bringing
a
contempt
action.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
it
has
to
be
a
lawful
order
before
there
could
be
any
punishment
for
contempt
of
it,
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
absolutely,
your
honor.
in
the
mine
workers
case,
in
a
variety
of
other
cases,
i
guess
mine
workers
is
probably
the
best
example,
where
the
court
said
that
the
court
has
or
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
their
jurisdiction,
and
in
that
interim
period
of
time
when
they're
mulling
it
over,
brief
time,
granted,
but
in
that
span
of
time,
they
have
the
authority
to
hold
matters
in
status
quo
in
order
to
make
these
determinations.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
well,
your
honor,
i
think
at
the
time
it
was
presented
to
him,
according
anyway
to
his
rescript,
i
think
it's
at
page
812
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief,
he
stated
that
the
journal
hadn't
presented
any
question
about
jurisdiction
at
the
time.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
he
may
not
have.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is,
and
perhaps
judge
boyle
openly
made
a
mistake
in
judgment
in
thinking
that
there
was
jurisdiction,
if,
indeed,
my
brother
is
right
and
there
isn't,
because
there
is
enough
federal
question
raised
and
presented
to
him
which
was
not
easy
to
answer,
i
think,
at
the
time,
to
allow
him
at
least
a
short
period
to
reflect
on
it.
not
a
long
period,
a
short
period
to
reflect
on
it.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
he
may
well
have
been
simply
focusing
on
the
merits,
your
honor,
although
the
federal
defendants
did
raise
the
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
they
did.
i
think
what
i
somewhat
expected
you
to
ask
me
about
when
i
mentioned
this
holding
of
the
status
quo
had
to
do
with
perhaps
the
status
quo
was
not
maintained
any
time
there
is
a
restriction
of
1st
amendment
rights
because
to
stop
someone
from
speaking
even
for
a
moment
is
irreparable
harm.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
yes,
your
honor.
unfortunately,
it's
not
entitled
judgment,
it's
entitled
order
of
conviction.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
as
i
say,
the
caption
was
in
the
matter
of.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
i
did,
your
honor.
i
did,
your
honor,
again
trying
to
conform...
no,
your
honor.
no.
i
did
try
to
proceed
in
accordance
with
the
court's
customs
and
laws
and
rules.
but,
justice
stevens,
in
considering
the
idea
of
harm
moment
to
moment,
so
that
even
two-day
restraining
order
might
be
considered
to
be
irreparable
harm
to
1st
amendment
rights,
i
would
suggest
that
those
rights
had
perhaps
been
waived
or
that
a
principle
of
estoppel
to
apply,
given
the
fact
that
the
journal's
lawyers
had
requested
a
continuance.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
well,
if
the
court
was
entirely
without
jurisdiction
and
that's
so
clear,
then
it
wouldn't
be
a
lawful
order.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
well,
your
honor,
as
has
been
said
not
only
by
our
trial
judge
in
this
case
but
other
judges,
there
is
at
least
the
ability
to
look
over
the
law
and
think
about
it.
i
think
in
this
case,
where
title
iii
was
raised,
where
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
raised
and
where
the
4th
amendment
right
was
raised,
there
was
enough
federal
law
presented
to
the
judge
to
put
him
on
notice
that
he
had
a
difficult
question
in
front
of
him
or
potentially
difficult
question.
as
justice
frankfurter
commented
in
his
concurrence
in
the
mine
workers
case,
questions
of
jurisdiction
are
peculiarly
fit
to
determination
by
court
as
opposed
to
determination
by
private
parties.
as
it
turns
out,
i
gather
the
freedom
of
information
act
does
not
provide
for
injunctions.
at
that
time,
title
iii
did
not
provide
for
injunctions.
perhaps
the
4th
amendment
does
not
provide
any
kind
of
remedy,
but
those
matters,
i
think,
have
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
case
as
opposed
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
has
to
be
a
colorable
basis
for
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
there
has
to
be
at
least
something
to
latch
hold
of,
even
if
the
judge
makes
the
wrong
decision,
as
perhaps
he
did
make
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
well,
maybe
going
backwards
in
time,
that's
what
you
say.
i
tend
to
think
in
this
case
that
there
was
enough
federal
law
presented
to
him
to
make
it
a
colorable
claim.
so,
i
suggest
to
you
that
jurisdiction
ought
not
to
be
a
problem
for
you,
that
the
fact
that
the
journal's
lawyers
had
requested
a
continuance
ought
to
essentially
have
given
the
court
system,
not
just
the
district
judge,
but
the
court
of
appeals
and
perhaps
this
court,
a
couple
of
days
within
the
publisher's
schedule
and
within
their
own
requests
to
figure
this
case
out.
i
would
request
that
you
seriously
consider
reinstating
the
contempt.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
d.
parrillo
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
i
make
just
one
point
and
not
stretch
your
patience
any
longer,
and
that
would
be
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
cases
where
a
party
is
permitted
to
violate
an
order
and
later
challenge
its
validity
in
defense
of
contempt
proceedings.
those
cases,
the
cobbledick
case,
the
ryan
case,
and
so
forth,
all
stem
from
the
idea
that
the
prompt
administration
of
justice
simply
does
not
permit
appeals
from
such
orders
and
because
no
appeals
lay
in
those
cases,
then
those
parties
are
permitted
to
go
ahead
and
violate
against
the
usual
rule
that
is
urged
by
special
prosecutor,
that
all
orders
must
be
obeyed.
as
was
indicated
in
the
united
states
v.
ryan
case,
in
footnote
4,
the
distinction
was
drawn
and
said
that
walker
was
no
different.
walker
was
totally
consistent
with
that
because
in
walker,
there
were
procedures
available
for
review.
i
simply
would
like
to
make
that
distinction
and
thank
you
for
your
patience.
