justice
scalia
mr.
parrillo,
before
you
get
too
deep
into
the
merits,
would
you
say
a
couple
of
words
about
the
motion
that
we
have
to
dismiss
the
writ
because...
well,
essentially,
the
caption
of
this
case
is
united
states
of
america
v.
providence
journal
company.
it's
a
criminal
suit
for
enforcement
of
a
criminal
statute,
and
section
518(a)
of
title
28
says
that
except
the
attorney
general
in
a
particular
case
directs
otherwise,
the
attorney
general
and
the
solicitor
general
shall
conduct
and
argue
suits
in
this
court.
now,
you
are
not
the
attorney
general
or
the
solicitor
general.
you
haven't
been
delegated
any
authority
by
them,
as
i
understand
it.
you're
appointed
by
the
district
court.
justice
scalia
now,
how
can
we
entertain
this
suit
in
light
of
section
518(a)?
this
is
a
suit
by
the
united
states,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
under
a
criminal
statute.
justice
scalia
that
can
be
vindicated
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
level
without
having
you
come
here,
without
the
permission
of
the
attorney
general
or
the
solicitor
general.
that
vindication
would
exist
anyway.
the
courts
aren't
out
of
the
play.
it's
just
that
unless
the
solicitor
general
or
the
attorney
general
thinks
this
matter
is
important
enough
to
warrant
this
court's
attention,
as
i
read
the
statute,
it
does
not
come
here.
justice
scalia
well,
give
me
another
reading.
what...
are
you
representing
the
united
states
or
not?
justice
scalia
well,
the
statute
says
that
the
united
states
will
be
represented
here
by
the
solicitor
general
or
the
attorney
general.
justice
scalia
and
they
don't
want
this
case
here,
apparently,
or
they
would
have
brought
it
here
themselves.
perhaps
we
violated
the
law
when
we
granted
your
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
scalia
can
the
united
states
attorney
petition
for
certiorari
even
though
the
solicitor
general
and
the
attorney
general
don't
want
it?
justice
scalia
but
it's
the
same
suit;
it's
the
very
same
prosecution.
justice
scalia
does
that
answer
mean
that
you
think
if
anybody
walks
in
off
the
street
and
tries
to
bring
an
appeal
to
this
court
in
a
federal
case,
so
long
as
the
attorney
general
says
it's
okay,
it's
proper
for
us
to
entertain
it?
justice
scalia
but
he
hasn't
authorized
you.
he's
just
said
he
has
no
objection
to
your
going
off
and
doing
your
own
thing.
justice
scalia
so,
can
he
say
that
to
anybody,
anybody
at
all
can
bring
a
matter
before
us
simply
because
the
attorney
general
says
that's
okay
by
me,
section
518(a)
isn't
that
important
as
far
as
i'm
concerned?
justice
scalia
would
it
be
a
judicial
function
if
it
had
been
given
to
the
united
states
attorney?
justice
scalia
you
were
in
the
lower
courts
under
young.
young
didn't
speak
to
what
happens
in
this
court.
this
statute
only
applies
to
the
supreme
court
and
a
couple
of
other
courts.
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
the
district
courts.
so,
young
didn't
speak
to
this.
mr.
parrillo,
you've
now
had
fifteen
minutes
of
your
time
consumed.
you
have
fifteen
minutes
remaining.
i
hope
when
you're
given
an
opportunity
to
do
so,
you'll
address
some
of
your
remarks
to
the
question
on
which
this
court
voted
to
grant
certiorari.
justice
scalia
mr.
parrillo,
i'm
not
clear.
do
you
concede
that
if
there
is
no
colorable
basis
for
jurisdiction,
the
case
is
at
an
end,
that
you
don't
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
jurisdiction
when
there's
no
colorable
basis
for
jurisdiction?
justice
scalia
so,
a
judge
is
not
given
any
time
to
determine
whether
there's
a
colorable
basis;
he
has
to
figure
that
out
right
away?
