justice
o'connor
mr.
parrillo,
i
guess
you
concede,
do
you
not,
that
there
was,
indeed,
no
basis
on
which
the
judge
could
properly
enter
a
restraining
order
here?
justice
o'connor
you
don't.
justice
o'connor
you
think
it
was
perfectly
lawful?
justice
o'connor
i
see.
i
wonder
if
you
could
offer
anything
to
indicate
to
us
that
perhaps
it
was
proper
for
the
judge
to
have
entered
it.
i
confess
i
couldn't
find
anything,
and
i
wondered
if
you
had.
justice
o'connor
well,
how
could
the
journal
have
been
responsible
for
any
4th
amendment
violations?
justice
o'connor
i
somehow
thought
we
took
the
case
just
assuming
that
the
issuance
of
the
restraining
order
was
error,
and
took
it
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
the
court,
nonetheless,
whether
it
can
be
raised
in
the
contempt
proceedings.
justice
o'connor
but
you
don't
want
to
concede
that
it
was
unlawful?
justice
o'connor
mr.
parrillo,
does
section
18
u.s.
code
section
401
have
any
bearing
on
the
case?
that
section
authorizes
federal
courts
to
punish
disobedience
of
their
lawful
orders.
justice
o'connor
so,
do
we
need
to
look
and
see
if
this
was
a
lawful
order
then?
justice
o'connor
and
do
you
think
that
any
temporary
restraining
order
issued
for
the
purpose
of
letting
the
court
determine
its
own
jurisdiction
is
a
lawful
order?
justice
o'connor
mr.
abrams,
does
a
court
always
have
jurisdiction
at
least
to
determine
its
own
jurisdiction?
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
a
different
concept.
do
we
get
as
far
here
as
saying
the
trial
court
had
jurisdiction
to
enter
the
tro?
justice
o'connor
what
if
the
judge
had
recited
on
the
face
of
the
order
that
he
wasn't
sure
if
he
had
jurisdiction
and
he
entered
the
order
only
to
preserve
the
status
quo
until
he
could
make
that
determination?
