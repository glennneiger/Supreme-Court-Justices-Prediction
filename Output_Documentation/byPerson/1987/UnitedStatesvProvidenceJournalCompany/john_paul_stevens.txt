justice
stevens
but,
mr.
parrillo,
was
this
matter
held
in
status
quo
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
district
judge
to
determine
his
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
i
know,
which
would
suggest
to
me
that
he
didn't
have
any
doubt
about
his
jurisdiction.
justice
stevens
so,
he
didn't
need
time
to
make
the
jurisdictional
inquiry.
but,
nevertheless,
your
opponent
argues
in
the
last
part
of
its
brief
that
there
really
is
no
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
anyway,
and
in
that
event,
the
order
would
fall
for
that
independent
reason.
do
you
think
there
is
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
i
understood
from
my
reading
of
it,
maybe
i
have
it
wrong,
is
that
he
was
reflecting
on
the
merits
rather
than
whether
there
was
any
jurisdiction
at
all.
justice
stevens
did
they
raise
it
at
that
very
first
conference?
justice
stevens
they
did?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that
insofar
as
you're
addressing
the
merits,
but
i
think
that
we
do
take
a
little
different
approach
if
the
court
was
entirely
without
jurisdiction
of
the
litigation
at
all.
justice
stevens
what
do
you
think
is
the
strongest
argument
supporting
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
case?
justice
stevens
mr.
abrams,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
section
518(a)
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
that
language
to
apply
to
a
case
like
this
or
to
a
case
where
a
special
prosecutor
possibly
prosecuting
the
attorney
general
or
the
solicitor
general,
that
in
such
a
case
it's
still
up
to
the
solicitor
general
and
attorney
general
to
decide
whether
review
would
be
proper?
justice
stevens
i
understand
the
plain
language
argument,
but
do
you
think
if
congress
had
asked
itself
the
question,
do
we
want
the
attorney
general
to
decide
in
the
case
in
which
he
is
interested
as
an
individual,
as
opposed
to
the
united
states,
is
he
able
to
control
review,
do
you
think
congress
would
have
said
yes,
we
still
want
him
to
do
it?
justice
stevens
of
course,
that's
a
constitutional
decision
interpreting
the
power
of
the
president
rather
than
the
statutory
interpretation
question
of
what
congress
might
have
intended
in
a
situation
like
this.
justice
stevens
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question?
justice
stevens
one
of
the
elements
that
your
opponent
stresses
is
the
fact
that
at
that
conference,
counsel
for
the
newspaper
seemed
more
or
less
acquiescent
to
a
two-day
delay,
partly
because
the
questions
were
novel
and
he
might
have
needed
time
and
so
forth,
so
there
was
a
little
bit
of
an
element
of
almost
a
consent
order.
it
isn't.
i
understand
that.
what
if
it
had
been,
though?
what
if
the
lawyer
had
not
understood
the
time
pressures
on
his
client
and
had
said
expressly,
i'll
stipulate
to
the
entry
of
this
order
which
enjoins
us
for
forty-eight
hours?
he
got
back
and
he
found
out
that
he
really
pulled
a
boner.
and
then
they
went
ahead
and
violated
it
and
it
was
transparently
true
that
he
could
not
have
entered
such
an
order.
would
that
be
enforceable
in
your
view
it's
a
prior
restraint.
justice
stevens
correct.
justice
stevens
what
if,
just
to
take
it
a
little
step
closer,
what
if
he
said,
i
have
no
objection
to
that
order,
your
honor?
the
other
asked
for
it.
he
said,
you
know,
he
went
through
it
and
said
that
certainly
seems
reasonable,
i
need
time
myself
anyway,
this
is
pretty
close
to
that.
