justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
respondents
are
a
newspaper
and
its
executive
editor
and
they
in
fact
violated
a
temporary
restraining
order
issued
by
the
district
court
in
a
civil
suit
to
enjoin
dissemination
of
memoranda
concerning
the
plaintiff's
deceased
father.
the
court
appointed
a
private
attorney
to
prosecute
the
respondents
for
criminal
contempt.
it
declined
or
asked
the
united
states
attorney
to
pursue
the
matter
because
of
his
representation
of
the
federal
defendants
in
the
underlying
civil
action.
the
district
court
found
respondents
in
criminal
contempt,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
solicitor
general
denied
the
special
prosecutor
authority
to
represent
the
united
states
in
this
court
in
seeking
reinstatement
of
the
contempt
judgment.
nevertheless,
the
prosecutor
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari,
and
that
writ
was
granted
and
he
briefed
and
argued
the
case
here.
we
now
dismiss
the
writ
of
certiorari
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
this
is
because
the
special
prosecutor
lacks
authority
to
represent
the
united
states
before
this
court.
section
518(a)
of
what
is
known
as
title
18
or
28
of
the
united
states
code,
empowers
the
solicitor
general
or
his
designee
to
conduct
and
argue
suites
in
this
court
and
i
quote,
“in
which
the
united
states
is
interested.”
this
is
such
a
case
if
a
judicially
initiated
contempt
citation
were
not
a
case
"in
which
the
united
states
is
interested,”
the
policies
underlying
the
statute
that
the
united
states
speak
with
one
voice
before
this
court
are
such
as
it
could
be
undermine
by
unauthorized
certiorari
petitions
filed
by
united
states
attorneys
or
by
special
prosecutors
at
the
behest
of
district
judges.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
but
joins
the
opinion
of
the
court.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
the
chief
justice.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part.
