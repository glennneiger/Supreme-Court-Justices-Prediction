mr.
parrillo,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
day
of
the
week
was
this?
was
this
a
friday?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
parrillo.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
abrams.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
abrams,
where
in
the
brief
is
the
letter
of
the
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
abrams,
if
we
were
to
adopt
that
point
of
view,
we
would
not
be
following
the
judgment
or
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
case,
would
we?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
in
one
of
the
states
that
has
capital
punishment,
someone
is
scheduled
to
be
executed
in
a
few
hours,
goes
into
the
federal
district
court
and
says,
look,
i
got
these
claims,
and
the
federal
judge
looks
at
him
and
says,
geez,
it
certainly
doesn't
look
like
much,
but
i
just
am
not
absolutely
sure,
i'm
going
to
enter
a
stay
anyway,
and,
so,
he...
the
state
says,
well,
this
guy
just
didn't
have
jurisdiction,
we're
going
to
ahead
and
execute
the
fellow
anyway,
it's
contested
later,
do
you
think
a
court
would
be
very
receptive
to
the
idea
that
that
judge
simply
had
no
power
to
enter
the
stay?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
abrams,
what
do
you
think
of
the
upshot
of
the
court
of
appeals
observation
that
you
ought
to
at
least
seek
appellate
review?
what
if
you
seek
appellate
review
and
you're
turned
down?
are
you
then
free
to
go
ahead
and
publish?
chief
justice
rehnquist
then,
you
would
be
subject
to
the
umw
ruling.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but,
i
mean,
supposing
on
this
branch,
on
the
court
of
appeals
statement
that
you
have
to
at
least
seek
appellate
relief,
supposing
judge
boyle
has
ruled
against
you,
you
go
to
judge
selia
on
the
court
of
appeals
and
you
present
your
case
to
him
and
he
says,
i
think
judge
boyle
was
right,
i
refuse
to
set
aside
the
injunction,
then
are
you
bound
by
the
traditional
rule
that
a
valid
court
order
is
binding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
could
have
found
a
judge
within
that,
couldn't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
abrams.
mr.
parrillo,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
parrillo.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-65,
united
states
against
providence
journal
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
