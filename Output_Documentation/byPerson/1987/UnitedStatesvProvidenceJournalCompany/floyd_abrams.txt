mr.
floyd
abrams
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
turn
first
briefly
to
the
motion
we
have
made
to
dismiss
the
writ
and
then
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
on
the
face
of
section
518(a),
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
question
but
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
united
states
is
"interested".
it
is
the
party
petitioner
in
the
case.
it
is
the
party
which
can
take
one
of
my
clients
that's
been
sentenced
to
eighteen
months
in
jail,
sentence
suspended,
but
hardly
forgotten,
to
jail
by
a
united
states
marshal
who
put
him
there
and
presumably
keep
him
there.
the
united
states
is
interested
in
this
case
in
any
ordinary
use
of
that
word,
at
least.
there's
no
question
but
that
mr.
parrillo
is
not
the
attorney
general
or
the
solicitor
general,
and
not
only
does
not
have
their
authority
but
was
explicitly
denied
that
authority
in
a
letter
from
solicitor
general
fried
annexed
to
his
brief
filed
in
this
court.
solicitor
general
fried
wrote
in
a
letter
of
july
2,
1987,
"to
the
extent
that
such
authorization
is
necessary,
however,
i
decline
to
authorize
such
a
filing
or
appearance
in
this
particular
case.
"
and
solicitor
general
fried's
amicus
brief
points
out
as
well
that
a
conscious
decision
was
made
by
the
solicitor
general's
office
not
to
take
this
case
over
and
file
a
petition
for
certiorari
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
so,
the
only
out,
it
seems
to
me,--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--there
is
a
brief.
it's
the
very
last
page,
your
honor,
to
his
amicus
brief.
not
on
the
merits,
but
on
the
motion.
mr.
floyd
abrams
in
that
letter,
he
urges
the
proposition
that
the
young
case
of
this
court
did
not
resolve
the
question
of
whether
authorization
of
the
solicitor
general
was
necessary
and
then
concludes
that
if
it
is
necessary,
he
declines
to
authorize
it.
so,
the
only
out,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
on
section
518(a),
if
there
is
any,
for
the
petitioner
here
is
if
the
united
states
doesn't
mean
the
united
states
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word.
in
short,
if
it
means
just
the
executive
branch
of
the
united
states.
mr.
floyd
abrams
justice
stevens,
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
is
very...
of
great
long
standing,
but
of
little
revelation
in
the
sense
of
a
direct
response
to
your
question.
almost
identical
language
is
contained
in
the
judiciary
act
of
1789.
it
has
been
continued
through
the
years
in
one
statute
after
another.
after
saying
that,
though,
i
can't
answer
you
directly.
i
know
of
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
directly
deals
with
that
topic.
it
would
seem
to
me,
justice
stevens,
that
the
plain
reading--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
i
think
congress
would
have
said
we
want
one
place
to
go
out
of
which
the
position
of
the
united
states
of
america
comes
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
and
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
self-interest,
there
will
always
be
self-interest
by
some
branch
of
government
about
some
course
of
conduct,
and
that
the
congress,
having
decided
to
put
the
power
in
the
executive
branch,
said
that
is
where
it
should
repose.
now,
an
argument
has
been
made,
justice
stevens,
which
is
at
least
quasi-constitutional
in
nature.
it's
made
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
and
it
is
a
separation
of
powers
argument.
it's
based
on
this
court's
young
decision,
and
it
goes
along
the
lines
that,
i
don't
think
i'm
being
unfair
to
it,
that
congress
cannot
put
the
power
there
because
this
is
instinct
in
the
judicial
power.
i
think
one
of
the
places
the
court
might
look
or
think
about
looking
there
is
a
case
not
cited
in
our
brief
called
in
re
grossman,
a
decision
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
at
267
u.s.,
in
which
this
court
was
faced
with
the
question
of
whether
the
president
could
pardon
someone
convicted
of
contempt
of
court
for
violating
a
judge's
order,
and
chief
justice
taft,
writing
for
this
entire
court,
unanimous
court,
held
that
while
it
was
possible
that
a
president
could
everyone
convicted
of
contempt
of
court,
and
thus
effectively
destroy
the
judicial
power
to
protect
itself
against
total
disregard,
that,
nonetheless,
the
pardon
power
governed
and
that
you
couldn't
cut
into
the
pardon
power
in
the
service
of
protecting
the
institution
of
the
judiciary.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--absolutely,
your
honor,
except
insofar
as
the
argument
made
against
us
is
the
separation
of
powers
argument
that
congress
could
not
provide
the
executive
branch
with
this
power
and
it
is
to
that
that
i
am
responding.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
would
be
just
the
same,
justice,
but
i'm
not
basing
this
on
the
special
prosecutor
using
the
words
"united
states".
it
is
the
united
states.
mr.
floyd
abrams
in
the
matter
of
the...
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me,
your
honor,
but
is
in
the
matter
of
the
contempt
proceeding
brought
against
the
providence
journal.
so,
it
didn't
say
who
it
was
that
was
commencing
it.
mr.
floyd
abrams
exactly,
your
honor,
exactly,
and
if
it
had
been
captioned
differently,
obviously
i'd
be
saying
all
the
same
things
to
you.
it
happens
to
come
within
a
special
clarity
because
counsel
has
chosen
so
well.
so,
i'll
say
no
more
on
that
argument,
your
honor,
and
i
will
turn
to
the
merits
now.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i'm
sorry?
no,
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
there
is
no
jurisdiction
and
that's
our
argument
to
you,
and
we
don't
think
that
you
can
be
vested
with
it
in
the
face
of
this
explicit
statute.
congress,
after
all,
has
the
power
to
cut
down
on
the
contempt
jurisdiction.
it
did
so
when
it
passed
section
401.
it
did
so
in
1831.
there's
an
enormous
amount
of
congressional
authority
here,
and
while
there
will
be
areas
where
that
will
be
debatable,
i
would
urge
upon
you
that
it
is
not
debatable
where
the
question
is
who
represents
the
united
states
of
america.
turning
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
i
would
start
first
with
the
proposition
that
although
my
brother
here
does
not
concede
error
of
the
trial
court,
he
necessarily
comes
awfully
close,
and
i
would
urge
upon
that
beyond
error,
we
have
a
case
here
which,
in
the
words
of
chief
justice
vinson
in
the
united
mine
workers
case,
any
claim
to
jurisdiction
was
frivolous
and
not
substantial.
in
that
case,
and
in
other
cases,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
judges
do
not
have
carte
blanche
to
enter
any
orders,
even
when
counsel
first
come
into
judicial
chambers
and
seek
temporary
relief.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
was
addressing
that
first.
the
court
of
appeals
says
nothing
about
jurisdiction.
i'm
simply
addressing
it
first
because
there
were
questions
and
answers
given
as
to
that
issue.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
were
ever
a
case
before
this
court
in
which
it
were
clear
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction,
it
is
one
in
which
jurisdiction
was
premised
on
two
counts,
one
of
which
the
freedom
of
information
act,
this
court
had
previously
held
in
the
chrysler
corp.
v.
brown
case,
there
was
no
jurisdiction,
even
for
a
private
company
to
have
a
reverse
freedom
of
information
act
case;
the
other
of
which
title
iii
is
clear,
we
would
urge
upon
you
in
the
face
of
the
statute
that
there's
no
private
cause
of
action
for
injunctive
relief,
and
the
third
of
which
was
really
brought
up
by
the
trial
judge
himself
at
the
pre-trial
conference,
the
4th
amendment,
which
is
not
mentioned
as
a
claim
against
the
providence
journal,
as
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
against
the
providence
journal,
but
which
was
mentioned
in
a
memorandum
of
law
submitted
by
mr.
patriarca,
not
as
a
basis
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
floyd
abrams
justice
o'connor,
a
court
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
jurisdiction,
but
where
the
claim
to
jurisdiction
is
itself
frivolous
and
someone
disobeys
the
order,
he
cannot
be
held
liable
and
in
contempt
for
having
done
so.
we
don't--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--no,
your
honor.
i
mean,
that
is
the
first
question
and
my
answer
to
that
question
is
he
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
the
tro
because
the
claim
to
jurisdiction
itself
was
so
frivolous.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
would
distinguish,
your
honor,
between
situations
in
which
one
might
criticize
the
judge,
one
might
well
not
criticize
him
in
a
situation
like
that,
and
in
which
what
he
entered
was
a
valid
order.
if
the
claim
to
jurisdiction
was
as
frivolous
as
i'm
urging
upon
you,
then
no
matter
how
he
said
it
or
how
little
he
knew
or
because
of
briefing
perhaps,
because
this,
after
all,
a
rather
quickly
scheduled
conference,
a
complaint
was
filed
friday,
the
judge
scheduled
a
conference
wednesday
at
lunch
time.
the
service
was
made
on
tuesday.
the
counsel
came
in,
the
judge
raised
these
issues,
somewhat
improper
issues
to
raise
at
all.
they're
interesting
and
they
may
be
important.
if
they're
clear
enough,
we
would
urge
upon
you
they
are
clear
enough,
then
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no.
i
certainly
understand,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
court
would
not
be,
and
in
united
states
v.
shipp,
i
think,
is
an
example
in
which
this
court
was
not,
and
rightly
not,
sympathetic
to
any
such
claim.
nonetheless,
this
court
has
made
clear
through
the
years,
at
least
as
i
read
the
umw
case,
that
there
is
at
least
some
category
of
case
as
to
which
the
claim
to
jurisdiction
is
so
weak,
so
previously
decided,
so
lacking
in
any
viability
at
all,
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
so
to
speak,
to
decide
jurisdiction
in
a
binding
fashion.
suppose,
for
example,
counsel
in
this
case
had
simply
come
in
on
the
freedom
of
information
act,
no
reference
to
the
4th
amendment,
no
reference
at
all
to
title
iii,
and
this
case,
this
court
had
previously
decided
in
chrysler
v.
brown,
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
the
word
the
court
used,
no
jurisdiction
for
a
reverse
freedom
of
information
act,
the
case,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
that
is
not
only
binding
authority
but,
for
purposes
of
the
later
contempt
action,
just
the
sort
of
authority
which
should
lead
the
court
to
say
the
alleged
contemptor
should
not
be
liable
for
violating
that
order.
at
least
that's
the
way
i
read
the
umw.
beyond
jurisdiction,
to
the
broader
merits
issue,
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
reach,
we
have
urged
upon
the
court
and
do
urge
upon
the
court
really
two
lines
of
argument.
in
the
walker
v.
birmingham
case,
this
court
was
very
careful
to
distinguish
cases
involving
"pure
speech"
from
cases
involving
speech
plus
conduct.
it
also
indicated,
i
would
say
more
than
indicated,
it
strongly
suggested
that
if
walker
v.
birmingham
had
been
a
case
in
which
the
order
was
transparently
invalid
or
had
only
a
"frivolous
pretense
to
validity",
that
the
result
at
least
might
well
have
been
different.
the
court
did
not
hold
that,
of
course,
but
it
certainly
indicated
that.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
said
that
when
you
put
together
a
variety
of
factors,
the
presumptive
unconstitutionality
under
the
1st
amendment
of
this
prior
restraint,
the
absence
of
any
claim,
whether
one
calls
it
jurisdiction
now,
the
absence
of
any
viable
claim
at
all
in
support
of
the
proposition
under
title
iii
or
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
or
under
the
4th
amendment,
that
that
is
the
sort
of
order
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
could
not
give
rise
to
the
sort
of
order
which...
as
to
which
someone
can
be
held
in
contempt
for
violating.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
made
clear
that
in
the
future,
even
as
to
such
orders,
they
must
be
tested
by
judicial
review,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
although
it
said
it
in
dictum
in
its
own
ruling,
made
it
very
clear
that
it
expected
that
to
be
adhered
to
as
it
will
be,
i
assume.
so,
we
have
a
situation
then
where
based
upon
the
language
of
walker
but
more
the
whole
theme
of
walker,--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
to
mean
that
you
can
publish
at
your
peril.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
would
think
so.
i
mean,
i
think...
let
me
take
it
in
two
different
steps.
the
court
of
appeals
analyzed
this
basically
on
a
transparent
invalidity
theory
rather
than
the
pure
speech
theory.
it
took
into
account
it
was
pure
speech,
but
it
treated...
it
concluded
it
was
transparently
invalid.
if
there
were,
say,
an
order
of
this
court,
to
take
the
easiest
case,
it
would
be
hard
to
see
any
circumstance
under
which
an
order
of
this
court
could,
even
in
the
most
optimistic
moments
of
counsel,
be
deemed
transparently
invalid,
and,
so,
that
would
fail.
i
mean,
there
are
some
arguments
one
simply
cannot
make,
and
i
think
that
would
be
such
an
argument.
so,
to
the
extent
one
focuses
on
transparent
invalidity
or
some
such
notion,
frivolous
pretense
to
validity,
when
the
court
of
appeals
has
spoken
or
the
supreme
court
has
spoken,
i
take
it
that
that
would
govern.
it
is
only
if
you
come
to
the
other
branch
of
our
argument
to
you,
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach,
but
which
six
or
seven
state
courts,
highest
courts,
have
reached,--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
have
two
separate
answers.
i
think
the
answer
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
yes,
that
you
are
bound.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
meant
to
leave
open
is
a
situation
where
you
had
no
decision
from
the
court
of
appeals.
after
all,
it
was
the
court
of
appeals
which,
in
its
ruling,
speaking
about
itself,
said
that
it
was
left
with
no
clear
conviction
that
an
answer
could
have
been
had.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
right.
but
i
think
that
that's
what
they
were
speaking
to,
really.
so,
it
is
our
view,
your
honor,
that,
and
this
is
an
extraordinary
case,
we
have
so
few
prior
restraints
in
our
country
and
fewer
still
situations
where
something
like
this
occurs,
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
is
that
there
is
a
small
exception
to
the
collateral
bar
rule.
it
is
an
exception
in
the
area
of
an
order
which
is
so
wholly
insupportable
based
on
already-decided
case
law
and
the
like,
and
even
in
that
case,
they
have
said
in
the
future
that
you
must
make
a
good
faith
attempt
to
seek
to
appeal.
the
fact
that
there
are
and
have
been
exceptions
to
the
collateral
bar
rule
is
really
indisputable.
this
has
never
been
a
rigid
rule
requiring
immediate
and
total
adherence
to
every
court
order.
if
mr.
hauser,
the
editor
of
the
paper,
had
during
the
contempt
proceeding,
claimed
the
5th
amendment
and
the
court
overruled
it
and
ordered
him
to
testify,
it's
settled
law
in
this
court
that
the
way
to
test
that
is
to
claim
the
5th
amendment.
if
he
had
asserted
a
claim
that
he
shouldn't
produce
documents,
if
he
had
asserted
a
claim
that
under
the
1st
document,
if
he
had
asserted
a
claim
that
under
the
1st
amendment,
confidential
sources
were
protected,
all
that
is
settled
law
in
this
court
already,
that
the
way
to
test
those
orders
is
not
to
abide
by
them.
so,
it
is
not
as
if
we
have
a
principle
so
sweeping
that
any
disobedience
to
any
court
order
is
itself
a
contempt
or
itself
would
prevent
you
from
defending
in
a
contempt
case.
there
are
exceptions.
they
are
few.
they
are
deliberately
few
because
it's
so
important
that
court
orders
be
abided
by.
i
have
only
a
final
word
to
add
on
the
last
of
our
arguments.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
counsel
quite
literally
stipulated
to
the
entry
of
a
prior
restraint,
and
if
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
court,--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--assuming
that
for
the
moment,
i
think
he'd
probably
be
bound
by
it.
but
this--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
really
don't
think
it
is,
justice
stevens,
and
this
is
a
case
in
which
counsel,
and
the
record,
i
think,
is
clear
on
this,
opposed
and
only
opposed
the
entry
of
the
prior
restraint.
he
never
acquiesced
in
it.
the
testimony
of
opposing
counsel,
which
is
in
the
record,
the
testimony
of
mr.
patriarca's
counsel
is
there,
and
he
testified
that
there
was
never
any
agreement
or
any
acquiescence
at
all
in
the
order.
what
counsel
said
is
that
it
violates
the
1st
amendment.
counsel
then
made
a
mistake.
no
question.
he
made
a
mistake
when
the
court...
what
happened
was
that
counsel
of
patriarca,
when
the
judge
said
i'll
hear
you
tomorrow,
counsel
for
patriarca
said,
well,
i
have
something
else,
but
i
think
i
can
get
out
of
it,
i'll
call
judge
so
and
so
and
make
arrangements,
counsel
for
the
newspaper
then
said,
well,
i'd
like
another
day
to
prepare.
it's
not
a
venal
sin.
it
is
simply
a
mistake
and
it
is
not
a
waiver
of
the
1st
amendment
rights
of
the
journal
simply
to
have
said
that.
nor
is
it
a
situation
in
which
there
was
some
advantage
taken
of
judge
boyle.
for
better
or
worse,
the
order
was
violated
that
night.
the
night.
without
regarding
to
the
second
day.
so,
nothing
happened
as
a
result
of
that.
it's
not
like,
for
example,
the
moreland
case
of
this
court
where
counsel
sat
for
three
months
not
seeking
expedition
out
of
this
court
on
a
prior
restraint
that
was
then
outstanding
and
then
came
in
and
demanded,
so
to
speak,
expeditions
consideration
from
this
court
and
the
court
treated
it,
so
to
speak,
as
a
waiver.
that
is
not
what
happened.
it
is
much
more
similar
to
some
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
one
involving...
both
involving
cbs,
one
involving
cbs,
one
involving
nbc,
where,
in
two
separate
cases
around
the
country,
trial
courts
said
in
substance
to
attorneys,
turn
over
material
that's
about
to
be
broadcast,
so
i
can
have
a
look
at
it
and
make
a
judgment
about
whether
to
enter
a
prior
restraint,
and
in
both
those
cases,
counsel
initially
said,
all
right,
i'll
bring
it
tomorrow,
and
in
both
those
cases,
they
then
spoke
to
their
clients,
which
also
happened
here,
they
then
spoke
to
their
clients
and
their
clients
said,
what
do
you
mean,
to
turn
over
to
a
judge
a
script
of
our
broadcast
we're
going
to
show
tomorrow
and
they
came
in
the
next
day
and
they
said,
we're
not
going
to
turn
it
over.
in
both
cases,
there
was
a
contempt
finding
initially
and
in
both
cases,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
5th
circuit
and
the
9th
circuit
excused
counsel
for
having
said
that
in
the
heat
of
the
ordinary
desire
of
counsel
to
get
along
with
judges.
so,
your
honor,
it
is
really
not
acquiescence
in
the
order,
and
i
urge
upon
you
that
the
testimony
of
counsel
and
mr.
patriarca
himself
really
demonstrates
that.
the
only
other
thing
i
was
going
to
add
was
just
a
correction
to
one
thing
in
my
opponent's
brief,
which
is
of
some
moment.
it's
part
iii
of
our
brief,
in
which
we
deal
with
a
due
process
claim,
and
in
which
we
urge
upon
the
court
that
a
1st
circuit
decision,
called
united
states
v.
arthur
andersen,
had
previously
said
that
the
way
to
test
prior
restraints
on
pure
speech
was
to
violate
it
and
then
argue
at
the
later
contempt
hearing
that
the
order
was
improperly
entered.
counsel
had
urged
in
his
brief,
in
his
reply
brief,
just
received
by
us
a
few
days
ago,
that
we
had
not
made
the
same
argument
at
the
district
court
level.
our
district
court
brief
has
been
lodged
with
this
court.
at
page
22,
you
will
see
the
citation
and
brief
discussion
of
this
case.
it
was
relied
upon
there,
it
was
relied
upon
in
the
court
of
appeals.
if
the
court
reaches
it,
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
that
we
have
always
relied
upon
it.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
