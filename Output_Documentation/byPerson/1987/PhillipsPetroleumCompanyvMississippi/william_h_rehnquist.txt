chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
this
morning
in
no.
86-870,
phillips
petroleum
company
v.
mississippi
and
saga
petroleum.
mr.
gressman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
gressman,
certainly
chief
justice
taney's
opinion
in
genesee
chief,
as
justice
scalia
says,
extends
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
navigable
waters
that
were
non-tidal,
there
is
nothing
indicating
that
all
tidal
waters
were
not
also
included.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i
do
not...
when
you
say
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
extends
to
"tidal
waters",
and
then
you
go
on
and
say
"even
if
they
are
not
tidal,
it
extends
to
them
if
they
are
navigable.
"
i
do
not
know
if
the
necessary
inference
is
that
the
tidal
waters
which
are
not
navigable
are
excluded?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
collision
of
the
genesee
chief
took
place
on
lake
ontario,
i
thought?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if
you
read
chief
justice
taney's
opinion
in
genesee
chief,
you
get
the
impression
that
at
least
that
court
thought
that
navigability
and
tidal
characters
were
coterminous
in
england.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
then
you
never
would
get
a
situation
in
england
where
the
river
was
navigable
but
non-tidal,
or
tidal
but
non-navigable.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
what
i
am
uncertain
about
is
how
good
an
authority
your
river
banne
case
in
england
is
in
1604?
which
simply
is
applying
the
"public
trust"
doctrine
in
england
where
the
two
were
really
coterminous?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gressman.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
sones.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
sones,
with
respect
to
the
42
acres
that
are
in
dispute
here,
would
taxes
paid
on
that
as
a
separate
parcel,
so
that
a
separate
tax
payment
was
made
for
lands
entirely
subject
to
tidal
influence,
or
was
it
just
a
part
of
a
larger
parcel?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
now
42
acres
of
that
640
are
being
disputed
by
the
state?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
sones.
mr.
gressman,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
gressman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
no.
86-870,
phillips
petroleum
company
versus
mississippi
and
no.
86-939,
and
a
companion
case
etsi
pipelin
project

missouri
