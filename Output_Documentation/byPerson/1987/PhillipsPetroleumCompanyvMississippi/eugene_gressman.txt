mr.
eugene
gressman
than
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
equal-footing
case.
it
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
mississippi
became
a
member
of
the
union
in
1817
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
13
states.
the
"equal
footing"
doctrine
in
this
context
means
that
each
new
state
that
enters
the
union,
like
mississippi,
acquires
sovereign
title
from
the
united
states
to
certain
underwater
lands
to
be
held
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
public.
now,
in
this
situation,
and
in
an
unbroken
line
of
decisions
of
this
court,
dating
back
145
years,
to
the
case
of
martin
v.
waddell,
this
court
has
uniformly
stated
that
the
sovereign
title
that
attaches
to
a
subsequently-admitted
state,
relates
only
to
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
that
are
usable
by
the
public
for
commercial
purposes
of
navigation
or
other
commercial
activities,
such
as
fishing.
this
has
been
the
unbroken
line
of
authority
in
this
court,
that
state
sovereignty
equals
title
to
lands
under
commercially
navigable
streams,
rivers
and
lakes.
and
by
"navigable",
this
court
has
always
meant
"navigable
in
fact".
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
decision
below
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
is
diametrically
opposed
to
this
long
line
of
authority
in
this
court.
for
example,
on
page
10a
in
the
opinion
below,
as
it
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
says
that
the
top
of
the
page
that,
"it
is
our
view
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
the
united
states
granted
to
this
state
in
1817
all
lands
subject
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
and
up
to
the
then-mean
high
water
liable
without
regard
to
navigability.
"
now
that
is
incorrect;
it
is
inconsistent;
it
is
in
conflict
with
every
decision
that
this
court
has
ever
rendered.
he
cites,
for
example,
the
court
cites
illinois
central
rail
road
company
v.
illinois.
one
turns
to
that
reference,
that
citation
to
the
illinois
central
case
and
we
find
the
court
announcing
that
"ownership
by
the
crown...
and
therefore,
by
any
sovereign
state,
of
title
to
lands
under
waters,
is
founded
not
upon
the
existence
of
tide
over
the
lands,
but
upon
the
fact
that
the
waters
are
navigable.
"
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
has
ever
addressed
a
case
before
today
where
all
that
you
had
were
non-navigable
waters
plus
a
tidal
influence.
in
every
case--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--that
is
true,
but
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
purposes
of
the
"public
trust"
doctrine,
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
doctrine,
the
purpose
of
the
"equal
footing"
doctrine,
is
premised
on
the
public
need
to
use
the
waters
as
navigable
highways
of
commerce,
and
that
is
the
critical
fact
that
justifies
reading
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
meaning
that,
if
you
have
a
non-navigable
body
of
water
that
happens
to
be
subject
to
tidal
influence,
that
kind
of
underwater
land
can
never
become
part
of
the
public
trust
domain
for
the
very
reason
that
there
is
no
purpose
served;
there
is
no
commercial
navigability
that
is
possible.
and
therefore,
the
reason--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--certainly
not,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
every
navigable
body
of
water,
be
it
the
ocean,
the
mississippi
river,
or
any
other
large
body
of
water,
has
at
its
shore,
or
at
its
edges,
a
non-navigable
shoreline.
mr.
eugene
gressman
because--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--there
are
various
explanations
of
that.
that
is
a
natural
phenomenon,
of
course,
and
if
the
body
of
water
is
subject
to
tidal
influence,
such
as
an
ocean,
one
can
measure
the
extent
of
that
navigable
body
of
water
by
the
mean
high
water
mark
of
the
tide.
that
is
not
to
say
that
you
are
granting
state
ownership
of
the
entire
body
of
water
because
of
the
tidal
influence,
because
you
are
simply
measuring
the
inner
boundary
of
that
body
of
water
by
the
tide.
at
the
same
time,
you
see,
this
was
part
of
the
confusion
that
grew
out
of
the
english
experience
where
all
navigable
rivers,
due
to
the
geography
of
england,
were
the
same
as
tidally-influenced
waters:
the
tide
ebbed
and
flowed
to
the
ends
of
most
of
the
navigable
rivers.
and
so
it
became...
a
synonymous
expression
of
the
royal
ownership
of
the
navigable
of
the
tidally-influenced
waters
of
england.
but
we
found
in
this
country
that
that
kind
of
reliance
or
reference
to
tidal
influence
certainly
does
not
explain
how
the
state
gets
domain
over
fresh-water
streams
that
have
no
tidal
influence.
and
it
took
a
number
of
cases,
particularly
the
genesee
chief
case,
which
dealt
with
the
admiralty
jurisdiction,
to
dispel
the
notion
that
the
critical
element
with
respect
to
the
extent
of
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction
extended
only
to
those
rivers
that
were
tidally
influenced.
another
point,
your
honor--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--as
long
as
they
were
navigable.
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
necessarily,
as
long
as
they
are
navigable.
take
the
mississippi
river,
for
example.
and
this
is
the
problem...
one
of
the
problems
that
genesee
chief
was
talking
about:
you
take
the
mississippi
river.
now,
the
mississippi
river
is
navigable
for
1,000
miles,
but
the
tidal
influence
is
only
for
30
miles
up
the
river.
now,
if
you
were
to
say
that
the
public
domain
or
admiralty
jurisdiction
extends
only
for
30
miles,
as
long
as
there
is
a
tidal
influence,
that
made
it
impossible
to
extend
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
the
remaining
navigable
port...
freshwater
portions,
of
the
mississippi
river.
and
this
is
intolerable.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
but
i
think
that
an
example,
perhaps,
is
better
shown...
i
think
he
talked
about
examples
of
various
rivers
in
this
country,
like
the
mississippi,
but
i
think
that
affords
an
example
of
what
he
was
talking
about.
let
me
also
add
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
case
is
not
a
navigable
body
of
water
that
happens
to
have
a
non-navigable
shoreline.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
discrete,
inland
tributary
that
contributes
fresh
water
from
the
uplands
and
flows
into
a
navigable
body
of
water
known
as
the
jordan
river.
now,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
"public
trust"
doctrine
was
ever
designed
to
extend
public
ownership
up
into
interior
streams
completely
surrounded
by
private
riparian
owners,
streams
that
do
not
constitute
part
of
the
shoreline
of
a
navigable
body
of
water.
i
give
an
example
of
that
from
justice
fields'
concurring
opinion
in
the
knight
v.
u.s.
land
association
case,
where
he
pointed
out
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
suggest
that
the
chesapeake
bay,
which
obviously
is
a
navigable
body
of
water
tidally-influenced,
that
you
would
consider
as
part
of
chesapeake
bay,
the
potomac
river
as
far
up
as
the
tide
affects
the
potomac
river,
and
it
does
affect
the
tide
all
the
way
up
to
washington,
d.c.--
he
said,
"it
is
absolutely
absurd
to
say
that
the
potomac
river
is
a
part
of
the
shoreland,
or
the
boundary,
of
the
chesapeake
bay;
that
the
tidal
influence
that
is
effected
on
this
independent
river,
or
stream,
must
stand
or
fall
on
its
own
navigability,
not
derivative
from
the
body
of
water
into
which
it
flows
and
is
not...
certainly,
does
not
constitute
part
of
the
shorelands
or
the
tidelands
of
the
navigable
chesapeake
bay.
"
and
he
said,
"it
was
incredible
that
anybody
should
suggest
that.
"
yet
that
is
exactly
what
the
state
of
mississippi
is
claiming
here:
they
are
claiming
that,
because
this
little,
discrete,
independent
drainage
stream
that
has
no
more
use,
no
more
function
than
to
drain
the
heavy
excess
rainwater
off
the
uplands,
that
because
that
has
some
tidal
influence,
therefore
that
must
be
considered
part
of
the
public
domain,
as
if
it
were
constituted
some
kind
of
a
shoreland
or
a
tideland
or
a
tidewater
of
some
other
concededly
navigable
body
of
water.
the
state
of
mississippi
has
never
revealed
what
navigable
body
of
water
these
little,
discrete
streams
are
a
part
of.
are
they
a
part
of...
are
they
a
tideland
of
the
jordan
river,
or
are
they
the
tidelands
of
the
bay
of
st.
louis?
an
inlet
of
the
gulf?
or
are
they
the
tideland
of
the
gulf
of
mexico,
which
is
only
five
or
six
miles
away?
we
do
not
know.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
it
does
not
matter
except
to
say
that
it
is
totally
incorrect
as
a
statement
of
the
basis
on
which
you
impose
public
trust
dominion.
public
trust
dominion,
as
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again,
depends
upon
the
navigability
of
the
body
of
water
over
which
the
state
seeks
this
trust
dominion.
and
now,
if
it
is
a
true
tideland;
if
it
is
a
shoreland;
a
mudflat;
a
beach
of
a
navigable
body
of
water,
that
need
not
deter
us
because
that
is
simply
a
physical
fact
that
most
navigable
bodies
of
water
do
have
non-navigable
shorelands...
tidelands,
tidewaters...
however
you
want
to
describe
them?
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
your
honor.
the
submerged
land
act...
and
this
was
fully
explored,
by
the
way
in
justice
rhenquist's
opinion
in
the
state
land
board
v.
corvallis
company
in
footnote
no.
4
of
that
opinion,
at
429
at
page
371
that
the
effect
of
the
submerged
lands
act
merely
was
to
confirm
the
states'
title
to
beds
of
navigable
waters
within
their
boundaries
as
against
the
united
states
claims.
and
it
does
not
alter
the
scope
or
effect
of
the
"equal
footing"
doctrine.
and
quoting
from
the
bonelli
case,
which
in
other
respects
was
overruled
in
corvallis,
quoting
the
bonelli
case,
this
court
stated...
and
i
think
this
is
a
critical
restatement
of
the...
applicable
law
here:
"a
state
cannot
base
its
claims
to
lands...
that
means
underwater
lands...
that
are
unnecessary
to
a
navigational
purpose.
"
now,
that
means
that
the
state
can
claim
domain
only
over
those
waters
considered
by
and
of
themselves
that
are
necessary
to
serve
as
public
highways
of
commerce
a
navigational
purpose...
a
commercially
navigational
purpose.
and
that
is
the
whole
history;
that
is
the
whole
meaning;
that
is
the
whole
rationale...
for
the
"public
trust"
doctrine,
which
has
been
incorporated
into
the
"equal
footing"
doctrine.
and
the
court
below
simply
turns
away
from
that
long
history
and
states
that
lands...
that
title:
property
title,
can
be
based
solely
upon
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
without
regard
to
navigability.
that
is
just
totally
inconsistent
with
this
court's
long
line
of
decisions.
i
do
not
know
any
case
that
has
ever
said
that
you
can
base
public
title
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
the
inference
is
that
if,
from
the
fact
that,
if
public
title,
public
trust
title,
is
the
equivalent
of
navigability
purposes,
shall
we
say...
that
necessarily
excludes
from
the
public
trust
concept
those
waters
that
are
not
suitable
for
commercial
navigation.
and
that
is
what
this
court
must
have
met
in
illinois
central,
and
in
other
repeated
declarations
when
it
said
that,
"tidal"
depends
not
on
"ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide.
"
but
on
the
"susceptibility
to
commercial
navigation".
and
that
is
the
whole
reason
behind
the
doctrine,
that
is,
to
preserve
the
highways
of
commerce.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
your
honor,
the
english
common
law,
going
back
as
far
as
1604,
in
the
river
banne
case...
and
that
has
never
been
questioned
in
subsequent
cases
as
far
as
i
know...
stated
that
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
a
navigable
water
and
a
non-navigable
stream.
and
that
the
king
owns
and
controls
the
navigable
waters,
but
the
non-navigable
waters
are
subject
to
private
riparian
ownership,
and
that
has
been
the
history
of
the
common
law
in
this
country.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
would
say
"yes,
if
it
is
not
navigable
by
virtue
of
the
tide
reaching
them.
"
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
they
were
because
of
the
peculiar
geography
of
england...
such
a
small
country
that
all
this
was
set
forth,
explained
not
only
in
genesee
chief,
but
down
through
the
years
and
illinois
central
repeats
this
history
again--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--possibly
not,
but
that
was...
that
situation
did
not
exist
in
this
country.
i
mean,
it
was
an
entirely
different
situation,
because
here,
as
i
used
in
the
mississippi
river
example.
you
have
a
certain
portion
of
it
that
is
both
tidal
and
navigable.
whereas
above
the
tidal
influence,
you
have
waters
that
are
not
subject
to
the
tide.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
even
in
england,
i
suppose
there
are
little
streams...
discrete
little
steams...
tributaries,
that
are
not
navigable.
i
mean,
that
is
the
way
nature
is.
i
mean,
they
can...
nature
makes
these
large,
navigable
bodies
of
water
by
having
a
series
of
discrete,
little
streams
and
rivers.
and
that
reference
appears
in
a
lot
of
the
early
common
law
cases,
that
it
is
these
discrete,
little
streams
and
rivers
that
do
not
pass
through
the
control
of
the
crown,
but
they
are
reserved
for
the
private
riparian
landowner,
and
that
has
been
the
history
in
this
country.
the
little
streams
that
run
through
farmlands,
or
somebody's
back
yard;
a
little
creek...
that
is
not
subject
to
state
control.
and
if
it
just
happens
to
have...
unless
it
rises
to
the
level
of
navigability.
navigability
is
the
one
criterion
that
is
consistently
referred
to
as
the
test
of
the
"public
trust"
doctrine.
i
wish
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
eugene
gressman
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
just
say
immediately
that
neither
the
jordan
river
nor
these
little
tributaries
are
primarily
salt-water
in
content.
there
is
a
very
low
salinity
rate,
and
they
are
basically
carrying
fresh
water
either
from
the
uplands
or
further
back
up
the
jordan
river
area.
but
in
any
event,
i
would
certainly
state
in
further
confirmation
of
justice
o'connor's
query
about
the
impact
of
an
affirmance
of
this
decision
upon
the
many
landowners
who
have
for
generations
thought
that
they
had
title
to
the
little
streams
and
rivers
that
run
through
their
property.
and
by
the
way,
lord
hale,
who
ms.
sones
quoted,
also
said,
among
other
things,
that
"there
are
little
rivers
which
are
private
forming
no
part
of
the
king's
highways.
"
again,
i
reiterate,
that
the
king's
highways...
the
public
highways
today,
are
devoted...
are
there
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
the
commercial
activities
of
the
public,
be
it
navigation,
or
fishing
or
whatever.
and
when
ms.
sones
refers
to
the
fact
that
there
was
an
occasional
fisherman
engaging
in
fishing
operations,
he
was
not
doing
that
as
a
commercial
operation;
and
in
any
event,
our
problem
is
not
what
some
lonely
fisherman
may
do
today,
it
is
what
was
the
purpose?
was
there
a
commercial
navigability
purpose
to
these
lands
in
1817?
because
that
is
where
the
federal
question
begins
and
ends,
and
we
are
concerned
only
with
whether
these
lands,
underwater
lands,
were
commercially
navigable
in
1817
at
the
time
of
statehood?
and
what
has
happened
thereafter
is
of
no
consequence
in
determining
that
federal
question.
now,
with
respect
to
the
impact
of
this:
there
are
untold
numbers
of
landowners
in
mississippi
whose
title
to
non-navigable,
little
streams
running
through
their
property
will
be
put
in
jeopardy.
more
than
that,
there
are
before
this
court
in
the
form
of
amicus
curiae
all
twenty-two
coastal
states.
upon
the
affirmance
of
the
mississippi
court
doctrine--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--yes,
they
would
be--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--the
case
is
submitted,
right,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
