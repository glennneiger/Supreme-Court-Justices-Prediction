justice
scalia
mr.
gressman,
excuse
me.
is
it
not
possible
to
read
all
of
those
cases
as
extending
the
doctrine
rather
than
limiting
it;
that
is,
as
saying,
"if
waters
are
navigable,
the.
"
trust
"doctrine
applies,
whether
or
not
the
oceans'
ebb
and
flow
extends
to
those
waters.
"
is
that
interpretation
not...
although
if
the
ebb
and
flow
does
extend
to
the
waters,
the
"trust"
doctrine
does
extend
to
the
waters,
the
"trust"
doctrine
applies
despite
their
non-navigability.
is
it
not
possible
to
interpret
all
of...
is
there
any
of
those
cases
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
such
a
theory?
that
is,
navigability
is
the
extension
of
the
"ebb
and
flow"
jurisdiction?
justice
scalia
we
have
not
addressed
it
either
way:
we
have
not
said
"yes",
and
we
have
not
said
"no".
justice
scalia
what
do
you
do
about
the
last
ten
feet
of
the
ocean,
near
the
shore,
which
last
ten
feet
are
not
navigable?
does
that
mean
that
that
portion
is
not
subject
to--
justice
scalia
--and
why
is
that?
justice
scalia
right,
now,
how
do
you
know
where
the
ocean
ends?
why
is
it
not
reasonable
to
say
that
the
ocean
ends
at
the
point
where
the
ebb
and
flow
stops?
justice
scalia
once
you
have
accepted
the
principle
that
"navigability"
is
not
the
test...
as
you
just
have...
you
have
to
decide
where
the
ocean
ends:
why
does
it
not
end
where
the
ebb
and
flow
start?
justice
scalia
but
that
was
not
the
reason.
that
was
not
the
sole
reason
at
common
law,
mr.
gressman.
there
were
all
sorts
of
things
that
attached...
in
particular,
fishing
rights,
whether
it
was
navigable
or
not...
the
fishing
rights
in
ebb
and
flow
waters
belonged
to
the
king,
and
not
to
private
owners.
justice
scalia
and
the
state
did
accept
the
money
as
a
tax
payment,
did
not
understand
that
it
was
tendered
to
purchase
the
property,
did
it
not?
justice
scalia
let
us
not
exaggerate
it
too
much:
there
is
a
certain
amount
of...
a
degree
of
uncertainty,
in
the
"tidelands"
rule
as
well.
i
mean,
to
determine
how
far
up
a
river
the
tide
actually
ebbs
and
flows...
i
assume
it
diminishes
little
by
little
until
there
is
finally
one
molecule
of
water
that
moves
up
and
down.
that
is
not
a
very
easy
thing
to
calculate,
is
it?
justice
scalia
and
anyway
for
some
tributaries
further
up
the
mississippi,
are
you
not...
or
is
the
mississippi
tidal...
throughout
the
state?
justice
scalia
so
above
that
you
are
going
to
confront
this
same
problem
anyway.
it
is
not
as
though
you
are
coming
out
the
way
you
want
as
to...
would
avoid
the
necessity
of
determining
where
a
navigable
river
ends,
and
how
much
of
a
tributary
to
a
navigable
river
is
part
of
the
navigable
river,
that
is
still
going
to
be
a
problem,
is
it
not?
justice
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
are
you
going
to
answer
my
question?
justice
scalia
my
question
is,
the
confusing
difficulty
you
were
just
referring
to,
cannot
be
totally
eliminated
even
if
we
come
out
the
way
you
want
us
to
on
this
case.
it
is
still
going
to
be
necessary
to
determine
with
respect
to
navigable
rivers
that
are
above
the
tidal
level
where
the
navigable
river
ends.
that
is
still
going
to
be
a
problem
is
it
not?
