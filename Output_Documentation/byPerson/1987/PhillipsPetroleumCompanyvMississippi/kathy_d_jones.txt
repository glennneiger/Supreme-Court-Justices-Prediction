ms.
kathy
d.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case,
as
mr.
gressman
stated,
is
one
of
the
"equal
footing"
doctrine
and
the
limits
of
each
state's
public
trust,
the
question
can
be
answered
when
we
review
these
two
doctrines
together.
each
new
state
upon
entering
the
union
did
so
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
13
states
and
received
all
lands
that
were
subject
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
tide
regardless
of
the
navigability
of
the
water.
each
new
state
could
define
the
nature
of
her
boundaries
and
the
physical
extent
of
the
public
trust
lands,
as
the
original
13
states
did.
each
of
the
original
13
recognized
a
public
trust
interest
to
shorelands
that
were
subject
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
and
then
defined
the
extent
of
the
public
trust
shorelands
either
judicially
or
legislatively.
the
state
of
mississippi's
main
concern
is
to
preserve
the
ownership
of
the
lands
in
question
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
the
public
and
this,
by
necessity,
included
the
development
of
mineral
resources.
the
ownership
of
the
properties
in
question
remained
unchallenged
until
these
leases
were
issued
on
these
state
waters
for
ail
and
gas
purposes.
at
that
time,
the
individuals
who
owned
the
lands
adjacent
to
these
tidelands
sought
to
take
these
tidelands
from
mississippi's
public
trust
lands.
the
state
then
proceeded
to
defend
its
title
in
these
lands,
and
this
case
is
significant
not
only
to
mississippi,
but
to
all
states
which
have
a
coastline.
this
case
can
potentially
impact
thousands
of
acres
nationwide
where
states
have
relied
upon
their
theories
of
what
they
owned
in
their
public
trust
lands.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
your
honor,
the
lower
court
ruled
on
the
issue
that
the
payment
of
taxes
was
not
at
issue
in
this
case
simply
because--
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
--justice
o'connor,
it
is
true
that
the
petitioners
allege
that
they
had
paid
taxes
on
the
lands
in
question,
but
the
state's--
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
--the
title
which
they
had
were
quitclaim
deeds...
in
the
nature
of
quitclaim
deeds,
by
acts
of
congress.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
that
was
their
assumption.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
it
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
one
fundamental
principle
of
law
that
we
are
concerned
with
here--
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
--your
honor,
we
would
assert
that
the
payment
of
taxes
on
these
lands
really
did
not
affect
what
ownership
that
the
state
had
in
these
properties.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
the
municipality,
even
though
it
may
have
accepted
payment
of
taxes
on
these
properties,
the
lower
court
ruled
that
this
issue
did
not
resolve
the
question
as
to
the
title.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
on
these
42
acres,
they
would
not
be.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
your
honor,
this
is
not
a
new
issue
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
the
state
has
always
claimed--
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
--your
honor,
there
would
be
other
lands
that
are
affected
by
this.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
the
state
of
mississippi
currently
has
at
least
around
600
acres
that
are
tidally-influenced.
we
do
not
suggest
that
this
would
change
any
rights
of
ownership
that
these
people
have
in
them.
these
are
lands
which
the
state
claims
by
virtue
of
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide.
we
only
have
the
one
other
case
that
is
at
issue
with
this
one,
where
the
same
issue
is
involved.
so
as
far
as
we
know,
the
stability
of
titles
will
remain
as
they
are
with
the
exception
of
the
one
other
case
that
we
have.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
these
lands
were
not
issued
separately.
they
were
all
one
big
parcel.
the
parcel
that
petitioners
own
would
have
been
in
the
nature
of
640
acres,
more
or
less,
and
they
would
have
paid
taxes
on
the
whole
amount,
without
any
exceptions
to
this.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
no,
your
honor,
these
were
donation
claims
where
the
petitioners
actually
got
their
property.
to
determine
the
property
rights
of
states
and
of
individuals
in
the
public
trust
area,
we
must
look
to
the
law
of
this
nation
as
it
existed
in
1817
when
mississippi
came
into
statehood.
mississippi
came
into
statehood
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
other
states,
and
title
to
the
lands
which
the
federal
sovereign
held
in
trust
vested
in
mississippi
at
that
time.
the
public
trust
was
created
and
funded
and
title
to
these
lands
in
the
trust
became
the
property
of
mississippi.
mississippi
adopted
the
common
law
of
england
which
divided
lands
into
three
categories.
lord
hale
in
de
jure
maris,
stated
that
there
were
fresh
water
streams,
the
seabed,
and
tidal
waters.
the
tidewaters
at
page
378
included,
"arms
and
creeks
of
the
sea
so
far
as
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide,
as
well
as
the
foreshore
between
the
high
water
mark
and
the
low
water
mark.
"
in
reliance
upon
the
english
common
law,
14
states
use
the
main
high
tide
line
in
determining
their
line
of
ownership.
some
states
use
the
low
water
line;
and
other
states...
the
other
coastal
states...
use
some
variation
of
the
main
high
tide
line.
these
compilations
can
be
found
in
a
1960
report
that
colonel
gee
made
to
the
american
society
of
civil
engineers.
as
the
coastal
states'
amicus
brief
indicates,
there
is
no
uniformity
in
the
law
as
to
what
each
state
has
done
with
the
lands
under
its
public
trust.
the
lead
case
in
this
area
is
that
of
shively
v.
bowlby,
an
1892
case
which
discussed
at
great
length
what
the
common
law
of
england
purported
to
do.
the
test
asserted
by
petitioners
is
that
of
a
"navigability-in-fact"
standard,
something
that
was
added
once
the
propellered
genesee
chief
case
was
handed
down.
and
this
was
to
give
the
western
interior
states
public
trust
lands
which
they
did
not
have
since
they
did
not
have
a
coastline.
shively,
in
summarizing
the
original
13
states
law,
made
it
clear
that
there
was
no
uniformity
in
what
each
state
had
done
with
the
lands
under
its
tidewaters
within
its
borders,
but
clearly
stated
at
page
341,
"each
state
has
dealt
with
these
lands
according
to
its
own
views
of
justice
and
policy,
reserving
its
own
controls
over
such
lands
as
it
considered
for
the
best
interest
of
the
public.
"
"great
caution
is
necessary
in
applying
precedents
in
one
state
to
cases
arising
in
another.
"
mississippi
has
always
used
the
"ebb
and
flow"
rule,
and
employed
it
to
the
parcels
here
in
question.
all
of
these
parcels,
these
42
acres,
have
daily
tidal
influence
and
are
truly
"arms
and
creeks
of
the
sea.
"
as
discussed
in
the
treatise
discussed
by
lord
hale.
every
navigable
waterway
has
certain
areas
which
are
not
navigable
in
fact,
as
justice
scalia
indicated.
there
would
be
some
areas
close
to
the
shore;
there
would
be
estuaries
which
would
not
be
navigable...
even
on
a
fresh
water
river,
there
would
be
areas
near
the
river
bank
which
would
not
actually
be
navigable,
but
this
does
not
take
away
the
definition
of
a
navigable
waterway.
the
law
looks
for
certainty,
and
there
is
certainty
to
the
main
high
tide
line
which
mississippi
uses.
by
taking
the
main
high
tide
line,
a
finite
line
is
established
by
the
use
of
surveying
instruments,
by
the
use
of
tidal
datums
over
an
18.6
year
period;
and
to
use
any
other
rule
in
our
state
to
determine
where
the
ownership
of
the
state
lands
ends,
just
would
not
be
consistent
with
the
public
trust
lands
in
the
decisions
of
our
state.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
it
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
calculate,
justice
scalia,
but
it
can
be
done.
it
is
something
that
the
national
ocean
survey
does
by
the
use
of
tidal
datums
by
gauges
they
place
in
the
water,
and
these...
the
actual
boundaries
of
the
main
high
tide
line
can
be
established
by
the
use
of
these
gauges
and
by
the
use
of
photogrammetry,
which
is
the
use
of
taking
aerial
photographs
and
actually
marking
out
where
the
tide
line
would
be
established,
and
this
is
done
by
a
metes
and
bounds
description.
it
is
a
finite
description
of
how
far
the
tidal
influence
reaches.
this
is
done
over
a
period
actually
over
18.5
years
for
the
tidal
epic,
but
this
is
something
that
can
be
done
by
watching
the
gauge
rise
and
fall
every
day,
and
they
take
the
mean
high
tide
line
of
all
the
high
tides
and
the
low
tides
together.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
these
are
tributaries
on
the
east
bank
of
the
jordan
river...
i
am
sorry,
the
west
bank
of
the
jordan
river,
and
this
land
is
bounded
on
the
south
by
bayou
lacroix,
which
is
a
navigable,
in-fact,
waterway.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
the
jordan
river
is
salt-water
river.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
these
tributaries
are
also
salt-water.
they,
like
any
other
waterway,
also
have
fresh
water
that
comes
into
them
by
drainage...
you
know,
every
time
it
rains
you
have
a
runoff.
and
so,
at
times,
these
rivers
may
in
fact,
be
more
fresh-water
than
salt-water.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
they
are
salt-water
as...
at
times
they
would
be
fresh-water.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
to
the
extent
they
contribute
to
it,
the
jordan
river
backs
up
into
these
tributaries.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
it
is
possible
that
they
could
be
mostly
fresh
water,
if
you
go
for
a
long
period
of
time
without
any
rain,
then
the
salinity
content
of
any
of
these
areas
would
be
very
high.
these
would
be
times--
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
--well,
the
tide
would
not
change,
since
it
is
coming
in
from
the
gulf
of
mexico.
the
tidal
influence
would
always
be
the
same.
it
is
the
amount
of
the
fresh
water,
the
actual
runoff
form
the
rain
that
would
make
a
difference.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
the
"public
trust"
doctrine
is
used
in
mississippi
and
the
record
indicated
what
interest
the
public
actually
has
in
this
land.
there
were
testimony
of
at
least
seven
witnesses
who
indicated
that
they
had
fished
in
these
waters,
in
these
42
acres.
they
had
fished
for
some
salt
water
fish,
including
flounder
and
bluegill
and
catfish,
and
these
areas
were
used
by
the
public
at
least
for
50
years,
by
one
witness.
another
witness
stated
that
the
mouths
of
the
little
bayous
were
fished
because
the
fish
would
come
out
with
the
tide.
these
also
were
used
by
the
public
for
hurricane
protection
of
their
vessels.
when
a
hurricane
was
coming
in,
everybody
would
take
their
boat
in
and
hide
them
in
some
of
these
estuaries
that
are
in
question.
they
were
used
for
loading
dock...
well,
there
was
a
loading
dock
adjacent
to
one
of
these
parcels
where
actually
one
of
them
was
used
to
haul
paper
wood
and
pulpwood
across
these
waters.
the
parcels
were
designated
in
the
record
as
a
"small
bayou,
a
bayou,
an
inlet,
a
bayou
with
several
tributaries,
and
as
a
channel.
"
but
all
of
these
waterways
connected
to
a
navigable,
in-fact,
waterway:
the
bayou
lacroix
or
the
jordan
river.
so
they
are
all
actually
"creeks
of
the
sea".
they
are
"arms
or
creeks
of
the
sea.
"
they
are
important
estuaries
in
that
their
fish
and
other
aquatic
life
that
grow
and
prosper,
the
waters
with
their
underlying
soils
have
historically
belonged
to
the
people
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
it
is
a
factor,
but
not
one
that
we
feel
is
something
that
would
actually
change
land
titles.
for
the
states
that
have
been
using
"ebb
and
flow"
as
the
test
of
ownership,
there
would
be
no
change
in
the
title...
the
title,
to
tidally-influenced
waters.
their
assertion
is
that
it
would
impact
on
titles,
but
in
mississippi,
this
has
always
been
the
law
that
we
use
the
"ebb
and
flow"
test.
because
of
this,
we
do
not
feel
that
it
will
disrupt
titles
in
our
state
or
others,
as
they
have
indicated.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
these
bayous...
some
of
them.
some
of
these
bayous
are--
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
--are
i
would
say
anywhere
from
two
feet
to
four
feet
on
up
to
15
feet...
the
jordan
river
itself
is
about
30
feet
deep,
and
it
is
commercially
navigable.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
and
some
of
these
are
also
deep,
particularly
when
the
tide
comes
in.
they
are
bayous
just
like
louisiana's
bayous.
the
submerged
lands
act
of
1953,
which
was
discussed
earlier,
we
feel
confirms
the
state's
title
in
tidally-influenced
waters
to
the
main
high
tide
line.
we
do
not
assert
that
this
changes
any
title
that
the
state
has.
this
is
just
a
confirmation
of
what
mississippi
already
had
in
its
tidally-influenced
waters.
there
additionally
were
instances
in
the
record
which
show
that
a
14
foot
flatbottom
boat
could
get
in
on
these
waterways
and
actually
navigate
on
them.
these
were
people
who
came
in
to
fish
and
to
swim
or
to
bathe.
these
were
uses
that
the
public
has
made
of
these
areas
and
if
the
public
is
deprived
of
these
areas,
we
are...
this
will
undermine
an
important
right
that
they
feel
they
have
in
these
42
acres.
we
are
looking
to
make
sure
that
our
land,
as
we
have
established
it,
the
main
high
tide
line,
is
used
in
this
case,
because
the
public
needs
to
know
where
the
definition
of
the
boundary
is.
this
is
something
that
they
have
always
thought
they
had
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
testimony
had
revealed
that
they
had
gone
up
in
these
waterways
and
they
have
used
it
for
all
sorts
of
purposes,
particularly
fishing.
the
test
asserted
by
petitioners,
the
"navigable-in-fact"
test,
was
a
test
that
was
applied
to
interior
waterways.
now,
because
these
two
waterways
which
we
have
in
question
here,
the
jordan
river
is
a
"navigable-in-fact"
waterway;
the
bayou
lacroix
on
the
south
boundary,
is
also
navigable.
they
do
not
assert
any
particular
way
to
define
where
the
cutoff
will
be.
we
would
have
to
employ
some
other
arbitrary
rule
on
these
waterways
to
take
them
out
of
the
public
domain,
such
as
the
quantity
of
tonnage,
or
the
depth
of
the
waterway,
or
perhaps
the
type
of
vessel
that
could
navigate
on
the
waterways.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
the
mississippi
river,
as
mr.
gressman
indicated,
is
tidally-influenced
up
about
30
miles.
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
it
is
our
contention
that
where
you
have
a
"navigable-in-fact"
waterway,
you
will
always
have
some
areas
that
you
cannot
navigate
over.
it
might
be
a
few
inches
toward
the
shoreline,
but
if
you
had
determined
that
it
was
navigable-in-fact
waterway--
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
kathy
d.
jones
that
is
still
going
to
be
a
problem,
but
that
is
a
different
type
of
law
employed
for
fresh
water
as
opposed
to
tidally-influenced
waters.
we
would
assert
that
the
"ebb
and
flow"
rule
would
be
dispositive
of
this
case
because
we
are
using
it
to
mean
"high
tide
line"
as
our
definition
of
state
boundaries.
we
respectfully
request
that
mississippi
be
allowed
to
continue
our
stewardship
of
the
public
trust
domain
over
all
lands
that
are
tidally-influenced
up
to
the
line
of
the
main
high
tide,
and
to
protect
our
investment
in
the
future
of
our
state's
public
lands.

there
was
a
witness
who
testified
in
the
lower
court
that
he
had
cattle
that
he
saw
at
times
would
graze
down
to
some
of
these
areas
in
question,
and
also
the
jordan
river,
which
is
primarily
a
salt
water
river,
but
you
would
find
this
on
any
waterway
that
also
flows
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
or
any
other
salt
water
body
where
at
certain
times
of
the
year,
if
you
had
a
lot
of
rain,
the
cattle
could
come
down
there
and
graze,
but
at
other
times
the
salinity
content
would
be
so
high
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
drink
out
of
that
water.
he
also
further
stated
in
his
testimony
that
there
were
wells
and
other
ponds
on
the
land
itself
for
the
cattle
to
graze.
you
know,
this
was
just
at
odd
times
that
the
cattle
could
graze
from
these
waters.
