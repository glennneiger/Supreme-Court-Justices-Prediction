it
is
a
long
time...
it
is
over
150
years
that
they
have
been
paying
taxes,
is
it
not?
justice
blackmun
yes,
but
the
state
of
mississippi
or
its
subordinate
municipalities
gladly
accepted
the
payment
of
taxes?
justice
blackmun
i
know
what
the
lower
court
ruled,
but
the
fact
is
there.
and
you
cannot
overcome
it,
can
you,
as
a
factual
matter?
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
i
suppose
those
taxes
will
no
longer
be
paid.
