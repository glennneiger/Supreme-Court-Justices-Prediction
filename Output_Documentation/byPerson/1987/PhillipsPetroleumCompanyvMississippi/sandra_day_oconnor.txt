justice
o'connor
mr.
gressman,
the
submerged
lands
act,
of
course,
has
language
that
your
opponent
suggests
affects
the
resolution
of
the
problem:
it
says
that
all
lands
permanently
or
periodically
covered
by
tidal
waters
are
included
as
lands
beneath
navigable
waters.
do
you
think
that
that
has
some
bearing
on
this
case?
justice
o'connor
well,
ms.
sones,
i
guess
the...
petitioners
here
had
been
paying
taxes
on
these
lands
all
these
years
on
the
assumption
they
owned
them?
justice
o'connor
that
may
be,
but
is
it
not
correct?
i
mean,
the
assumption
of
everyone
had
been
that
the
lands
had
been
owned
by
the
petitioners
for
the
years
since
statehood
and
before?
justice
o'connor
well,
and
they
held
some
titles
that
purported
to
cover
the
lands
in
question?
justice
o'connor
and
they
had
paid
taxes
on
it
and
that
was
the
common
assumption
until
the
state
issued
the
mineral
leases?
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
that
right?
she
is
asking
just
a
fact.
justice
o'connor
yes,
thank
you.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
not
suppose
that
if
we
were
to
affirm,
there
would
be
additional
lands
that
are
now
in
private
hands,
or
use,
that
mississippi
would
in
the
future
claim
as
part
of
its
public
trust?
i
suppose
that
we
would
not
expect
the
state
of
mississippi
to
stop
with
these
42
acres.
undoubtedly
there
would
be
other
lands
in
the
state
that
mississippi
would
extend
its
claims
to,
if
we
were
to
affirm?
justice
o'connor
but
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
yes?
how
much
land
do
you
suppose,
in
all?
justice
o'connor
ms.
sones,
if
the
decision
below
was
correct,
that
the
public
trust
land
extends
even
to
discrete,
separate,
small
tributary
streams,
conveying
fresh
water
into
a
tidally-influenced
area,
apparently,
according
to
the
brief
of
the
american
land
title
association
as
amicus,
if
that
is
correct,
there
are
literally
millions
of
landowners
throughout
the
united
states
who
would
be
divested
of
their
property
contrary
to
the
understanding
and
expectation
of
those
owners
and
the
title
insurance
company
that
have
insured
their
title
through
the
years.
is
that
a
concern
that
we
should
we
should
have
in
viewing
this
decision?
:
because
it
would
extend,
of
course,
beyond
the
boundaries
of
mississippi.
