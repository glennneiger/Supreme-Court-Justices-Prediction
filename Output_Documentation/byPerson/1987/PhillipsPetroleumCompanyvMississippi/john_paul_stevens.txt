justice
stevens
of
course,
mr.
gressman,
under
their
theory
it
really
does
not
matter,
does
it?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question...
excuse
me?
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case
tributaries
to
the
jordan
river,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
now,
is
the
jordan
river
a
fresh-water
river
or
a
salt-water
river?
justice
stevens
and
are
the
tributaries
also
salt-water?
justice
stevens
to
the
extent
they
contribute
anything
to
the
jordan
river,
are
they
not
fresh?
justice
stevens
to
the
extent
they
contribute
water
to
the
jordan
river,
are
they
not
entirely
fresh?
justice
stevens
so
that
it
is
the
effect
of
the
backup
that
raises
the
level.
well,
would
it
not
be
possible
that
a
tributary
that
your
rule
would
apply
to
would
be
made
up
entirely
of
fresh
water?
and
just
have
the
tidal
influence
raise
the
level
of
the
water
somewhat
by
reason
of
the
backup?
justice
stevens
well,
i
suppose
in
that
case,
they
probably
would
not
get
much
influence
from
the
tide,
either,
would
they?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
purpose...
and
your
opponent
argues
that
the
purpose
of
the
"public
trust"
doctrine
should
be
kept
in
mine,
and
it
focuses
on
discrete
bodies
of
water
that
can
be
named
either
as
"bays",
and
so-forth...
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
"public
trust"
doctrine
as
to
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
before
you
sit
down?
when
i
was
asking
you
before
about
the
fresh
water
and
the
salt
water,
you
indicated
that
some
of
these
tributaries
were
used
for
fishing.
i
think
your
opponent's
brief
said
that
some
of
them
had
also
been
used
for
things
like
cattle
grazing
and
normal
pursuits
that
would
not
be
associated
normally
with
the
"public
trust"
doctrine.
is
that
correct
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
