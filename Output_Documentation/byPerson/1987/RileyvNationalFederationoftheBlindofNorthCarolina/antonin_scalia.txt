justice
scalia
excuse
me.
general
thornburg,
if
that
is
your
objective,
to
make
sure
that
as
much
money
that
is
collected
goes
to
the
charitable
purposes,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
much
more
efficient
way
than
requiring
the
fundraiser
agent
to
say
what
percentage
of
his
collected
funds
went
to
the
charity,
not
in
this
campaign
but
in
prior
campaigns,
a
much
more
effective
way
would
be
to
require
the
charity
itself,
whether
it
operates
directly
or
through
an
agent,
to
tell
the
prospective
donor
how
much
of
the
donor's
money
is
going
to
go
directly
to
the
intended
recipients.
for
example,
requiring
the
red
cross
to
say
that
x
percent
of
the
money
you
give
us
is
expended
on
salaries
of
our
officers
and
employees,
and
x
percent
goes
to
the
donees
whom
you
think
are
going
to
be
getting
this
money.
or
any
other
organization.
isn't
that
much
more
efficient?
justice
scalia
you
require
the
charities
in
north
carolina
to
tell
the
donors
how
much
of
the
money
it
is
getting
for,
let's
say,
hunger
relief
in
wherever,
will
go
there?
justice
scalia
these
people
have
no
objection
to
that,
to
filing
it
and
having
it
available
on
request,
as
i
understand
what
they
are
saying
here.
justice
scalia
but
you
don't
require
the
charities
themselves
to
make
that
much
more...
much
more
pertinent
disclosure.
justice
scalia
well,
it
is
one
thing
to
disclose...
make
them
disclose
what
they
are
going
to
charge.
you
are
making
them
disclose
what
they
have
charged
on
earlier
occasions
to
different
clients
for
different
campaigns.
it
is
sort
of
like
requiring
a
lawyer
to
say
to
a
prospective
client
how
much
he
has
charged
for
the
last
ten
pieces
of
litigation
that
he
conducted.
now,
there
is
no
necessary
relation
to
what
this
piece
of
litigation
is
going
to
cost.
justice
scalia
general
thornburg,
suppose...
you
say
this
is
just
commercial
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
free
speech
rights.
suppose
political
candidates
hire
hollywood
personalities
to
further
their
political
cause.
do
you
think...
and
these
personalities
do
it
for
pay.
do
you
think
the
state
could
impose
a
requirement
that
before
the
famous
actor
makes
a
pitch
for
a
particular
candidate
he
would
have
to
say
at
the
beginning,
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
am
doing
this
for
pay,
and
my
usual
fee
is
thus
and
such?
that
is
just...
do
you
think
you
could
do
that?
justice
scalia
general,
the
problem...
i
find
it
hard
to
credit
your
argument
that
you
are
helping
the
charities
here
and
protecting
them
against
something.
one
of
the
plaintiffs
here
is
a
charity.
the
only
amici
we
have
had
who
are
charities
have
all
intervened
on
the
side
of
your
opponent,
not
on
your
side.
they
evidently
don't
think
they
are
being
helped.
why
is
it
that
you
think
they
are
being
helped?
justice
scalia
maybe
it
wants
to
determine
for
itself
what
is
a
reasonable
price
for
it
to
pay
to
get
its
message
across
and
doesn't
want
you
to
determine
it
for
it.
shouldn't
it
have
that
right?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
the
state
could
put
a
maximum
price
on
how
much
a
political
organization
can
rent
a
hall
for
a
political
rally?
justice
scalia
so
i
guess
what
we
are
talking
about
on
your
view
of
it
is
whether
this
is
closer
to
a
political
type
speech
than
it
is
to
whatever
normal
theater
speech
would
be,
on
your
view.
justice
scalia
well,
that
is
not
really
dispositive.
i
mean,
you
acknowledge
that
the
state
could
impose
a
tax
on
engaging
in
the
business
of
being
a
professional
fundraiser,
i
presume,
right?
justice
scalia
and
a
fundraiser
might
say,
well,
given
the
choice
of
fundraising
in
north
carolina
or
somewhere
else
that
doesn't
have
the
tax,
i
will
just
stay
out
of
north
carolina,
but
that
wouldn't
make
it
unconstitutional,
would
it?
justice
scalia
well,
if
it's
a
prior
restraint,
fine.
but
the
mere
fact
that
its
effect
is
to
keep
people
out...
keep
fundraisers
out
of
north
carolina,
that
in
and
of
itself
doesn't
prove
anything.
a
lot
of
things
can
keep
professional
fundraisers
out
of
north
carolina.
justice
scalia
well,
you
would
still
have
the
problem
that
it
doesn't
mean
anything.
i
mean,
the
problem
you
were
just
immediately
addressing,
that
these
figures
as
to
what
the
past
record--
justice
scalia
--i
see.
