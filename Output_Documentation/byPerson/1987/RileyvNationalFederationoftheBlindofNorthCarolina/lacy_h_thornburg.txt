mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
honorable
court,
north
carolina
is
here
today
because
of
the
lower
courts'
interpretations
of
your
decisions
in
the
munson
and
schaumburg.
the
lower
courts'
interpretations
effectively
eliminate
the
state's
police
power
to
regulate
the
for
profit
commercial
operator
who
solicits
funds
for
charities.
now,
schaumberg
and
munson
held
that
a
state's
limitations
on
the
amount
a
charity
could
spend
for
fundraising
activities
violated
the
charity's
first
amendment
rights
to
free
speech.
north
carolina
has
placed
no
limitation
on
the
amount
a
charity
may
spend
to
get
its
message
out.
in
fact,
north
carolina's
policy
is
to
promote
and
to
protect
the
charities
because
of
the
fundraising
efforts
of
the
charity,
and
this
is
the
historic
parens
patriae
relationship
between
a
state
and
a
charity.
the
north
carolina
approach
regulates
two
troublesome
economic
practices
of
the
commercial
fundraiser
dealing
with
reasonableness
of
fees
and
also
point
of
solicitation
disclosure,
and
eliminates
a
privilege
that
was
previously
given
to
the
commercial
fundraiser
to
operate
before
being
fully
licensed.
now,
the
lower
court
overlooked
the
distinction
between
the
publicly
supported
charity
and
the
commercial
fundraiser.
north
carolina
in
this
statutory
scheme
seeks
only
to
regulate
the
professional
fundraiser
under
its
police
power.
now,
by
way
of
factual
background,
for
a
number
of
years
in
the
state
of
north
caroline
we
have
mirrored
the
national
practice
and
problems
with
the
commercial
fundraiser
as
shown
by
the
uncontested
record
in
the
case,
the
difficulties,
and
the
most
frequent
complaints
that
were
experienced
in
north
carolina
with
the
fundraisers
related
to
high
fees
and
costs
which
caused
low
returns
to
the
charities,
a
lack
of
disclosure
of
fees
at
the
time
of
solicitation,
and
frequently
the
unauthorized
use
of
the
charities
names
at
the
time
solicitations
were
being
made.
now,
to
assess
the
factual
basis
for
these
fee
concerns,
i
had
my
staff
do
an
analysis
of
the
reports
of
five
of
the
largest
fundraising
groups
in
north
carolina
for
the
period
from
1980
to
1984,
and
this
showed,
this
analysis
showed
that
charities
were
receiving
on
the
average
less
than
20
percent
of
the
total
funds
that
were
collected
from
this
source,
in
other
words,
80
percent
was
regularly
going
another
direction.
the
other
complaints
that
i
mentioned
were
verified
through
better
business
bureaus
and
chambers
of
commerce
and
charities
and
individuals.
now,
an
examination
of
the
law
revealed
that
for
the
state
of
north
carolina
there
was
no
definition
of
fundraising
fees
on
the
books.
there
was
no
requirement
that
the
commercial
fundraiser
charge
reasonable
fees,
and
there
was
no
requirement
for
point
of
disclosure
of
factual
fee
data
at
the
time
of
solicitation,
and
further
it
was
discovered
in
the
law
that
the
commercial
operator
was
allowed
the
privilege
of
beginning
the
solicitation
process
without
being
fully
licensed
to
do
so
or
before
the
license
was
obtained.
now,
when
these
deficiencies
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
north
carolina
general
assembly,
the
legislature
enacted
the
statutes
that
are
before
you
today
in
this
case,
and
we
contend
that
the
purpose
of
the
statutes
is
set
out
in
the
statute,
to
protect
the
general
public
and
to
protect
the
charities,
and
also
is
in
keeping
with
what
professor
karsch
in
his
harvard
law
review
looks
to
as
saying
that
we
should
conserve
and
use
the
greatest
portion
of
the
wealth
donated
to
further
the
public
charitable
purpose,
and
also
adds
that
waste
should
be
minimized
and
the
diversion
of
funds
for
private
gain
is
intolerable.
now,
these
statutes
which
are
in--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--your
honor,
we
require
that
of
the
charities,
although
they
are
not...
and
through
these
fundraisers
they
are
not
involved,
of
course,
in
soliciting
the
funds,
and
what
we
are
trying
to
say
is
that
this
fundraiser
should
make
a
disclosure
to
the
prospective
donor
precisely
what
percent
of
the
money
is
going
to
the
charity
so
that
the
donor
will
have
in
mind
what
the
costs
are
as
to
the
fundraiser.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
we
require,
your
honor,
that
they
file
it
with
the
regulator
and
it
is
available
on
request.
the
same
is
true
of
the...
information
is
true
of
the
fundraiser.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
i
think
that
is
correct,
but
they
do
object
to
making
the
disclosure
at
the
time
of
solicitation.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
if
the
charities
themselves
are
involved
in
the
solicitation,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
the
commercial
operator
and
the
charity
itself
which
of
course
is
the
end
user
of
the
funds,
and
taking
the
property
or
the
funds
and
using
it
for
the
purpose
that
has
been
established
and
its
goals
that
have
been
established.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
exactly,
and
what
we
are
hoping
is
that
this
point
of
solicitation
disclosure
would
bring
some
interest
to
bear
for
the
prospective
donor
on
just
what
is
happening
to
the
money,
at
least
in
the
beginning.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
about
95
percent
of
them
are
telephone
solicitations
dealing
with
some
type
of
show
or
entertainment.
however,
there
are
some--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
exactly.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
a
certain
amount
was
returned
to
the
charity,
and
the
average--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--well,
it
could
bring
on
a
complicated
explanation
if
the
fundraiser
chose
to
use
it.
certainly
it
would
be
required,
the
law
would
require
this
disclosure
prior
to
the
time
that
a
solicitation
effort
is
made.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
we
think
that
the
minimum
amount
of
information
that
should
be
made
available
would
include
this
number
as
to
what
percentage
had
previously
been
returned
to
the
charity
so
that
the
perceptive
donor
would
understand
how
much
of
their
money
is
actually
going
to
a
charitable
purpose.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
well,
most
of
the
time
you
rely
on
past
experience
to
suggest
what
the
future
may
be,
your
honor.
and
we
felt
that
that
was
a
much
better
way
to
do
it,
for
example,
than
to
try
to
say
this
is
the
amount
that
is
going
to
be
involved
in
this
campaign
when
all
you
are
doing
is
guessing.
you
are
dealing
hard
factual
data
when
you
give
a
past
experience.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
we
require,
for
example,
the
banks
to
disclose
their
amount
of
interest
that
they
are
going
to
charge,
the
automobile
dealers
to
disclose
what
the
costs
are
and
what
they
are
doing,
and
disclosure
is
nothing
new
to
north
carolina
law
or
to
federal
law.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
your
honor,
if
it
is
the
same
type
of
litigation,
he
certainly
ought
to
have
some
idea
as
to
what
the
cost
is
going
to
be,
and
in
the
zauderer
case
you
said
to
the
lawyer
that
he
had
to
disclose
some
information
about
cost,
at
least
that
the
costs
were
going
to
be
there.
we
are
taking
the
hard
facts
and
saying
the
last...
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
all
right.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
thank
you,
your
honor.
by
way
of
further
reference
to
the
disclosure
aspects,
north
carolina's
history
had
been
that
we
have
had
no
trouble
with
the
charities
and
the
difficulty,
the
problem
had
come
from
the
fundraiser,
and
that
is
what
triggered
the
enactment
of
this
legislation.
what
the
legislation
did
was
define
what
a
fundraising
fee
was,
prohibited
unreasonable
fees,
established
a
procedure
to
allow
inquiry
into
these
fees
that
were
being
charged,
authorize
the
regulator
to
set
a
reasonable
fee
after
a
full
hearing
if
the
fee
charged
was
found
to
be
unreasonable
mandated
the
factual
point
of
disclosure
or
point
of
solicitation
disclosure,
and
prohibited
commercial
operations
until
the
licensure
was
complete.
now,
the
definition
was
added
to
the
statute
as
to
what
a
fundraising
fee
was,
and
unreasonable
fundraising
fees
were
made
unlawful.
now,
percentage
guidelines
were
added
to
assist
the
factfinder
in
determination
of
the
reasonableness
of
a
particular
fee
at
issue,
and
to
meet
the
concern
about
first
amendment
rights
of
charities
when
they
opt
to
speak
through
the
commercial
fundraiser
the
legislature
established
specific
rules
to
require
a
finding
of
reasonableness
when
the
high
fee
charged
was
caused
by
the
speech
or
advocacy
requirements
of
the
charity.
now,
the
statute
does
not
place
a
percentage
limitation
on
the
fundraiser.
it
merely
sets
up
levels
that
shift
the
burden
of
producing
evidence
from
one
party
to
the
other
at
specified
levels
above
20
percent.
now,
factual
mandatory
disclosure
has
minimal
first
amendment
implications
in
the
commercial
context,
which
is
what
we
are
attempting
to
regulate.
the
pharmacy
cases
and
the
lawyer
cases
recognize
that
disclosure
operates
to
inform
the
potential
user
of
the
service,
and
it
is
uncontested
that
the
entity
required
to
disclose
here
is
a
commercial
operator,
and
what
must
be
disclosed
is
factual
information
about
past
fees.
and
we
contend
this
court
has
held
that
a
state
may
require
this
type
of
disclosure.
now,
arguments
that
the
heightened
free
speech
rights
of
the
charities
should
carry
over
to
a
commercial
operator,
thereby
eliminating
the
state's
authority
to
regulate
the
activities
of
the
for
profit
commercial
operator
we
contend
should
be
rejected
because
the
speech
rights
of
the
charity
are
not
impacted
by
the
disclosure
requirement
placed
on
a
hired
fundraiser.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
i
think
we
could
do
that
if
it's
strictly
commercial
aspects,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
we
are
trying
to
say,
is,
if
you
use...
if
you
are
paying
somebody
to
do
that,
then
you
have
to
reveal
at
the
point
of...
at
the
point
of
solicitation
a
disclosure
as
to
what
your
practice
has
been.
now,
you
will
note
the
information
that
has
to
be
disclosed,
all
it
says
is
just
two
or
three
things
there
that
have
to
be
told.
it
doesn't
say
how
they
are
being
told
or
how
you
qualified
or
what
they
tell
in
addition
to
that.
it
is
not
a
censorship
matter.
it's
a
matter
of
just
requiring
disclosure
of
minimum
information.
and
we
contend
that
fee
disclosure
by
a
separate
entity
used
by
a
charity
on
an
occasional
basis
neither
requires
the
charity
to
speak
nor
prohibits
it
from
speaking,
any
message
that
it
wants,
and
public
policy
requires
this.
otherwise,
any
commercial
operator
could
limit
the
state's
regulation
by
using
the
name
of
a
charity
to
apply
to
its
operation.
now,
why
the
difference
between
disclosure
as
to
a
commercial
operator
and
not
the
charity?
our
position
is
that
the
commercial
operator
is
and
has
been
the
source
of
the
problem
in
north
carolina.
the
views
and
the
conducts,
the
fundraising
operation
as
a
business
is
involved
and
usually
works
on
a
percentage
of
gross
receipts
and
the
incentive
is
to
obtain
as
many
donations
as
quickly
as
possible,
which
indicates
or
suggests
that
you
give
very
little
information
or
it
is
almost
an
open
invitation
if
you
do
give
information
to
give
some,
misrepresentations.
now,
usually,
one
of
the
problems
is,
they
are
usually
transitory.
set
up
a
phone
bank.
hire
a
few
employees.
conduct
the
solicitation.
collect
the
funds.
and
within
a
short
period
of
time
the
fundraiser
is
gone,
and
clearly
the
public's
expectation
is
that
the
lion's
share
of
these
proceeds
are
going
to
the
charity,
and
actually,
in
reality,
in
north
carolina,
as
indicated
in
our
joint
appendix,
where
it
is
set
out
in
full,
usually
less
than
20
percent
is
going
to
the
charity.
now,
we
say
that
such
a
discrepancy
and
a
disparity
is
ultimately
going
to
cripple
the
charitable
fundraising
throughout
the
state
because
once
the
people
are
finally
told
or
they
get
the
message
that
this
much
of
the
money
is
going
into
some
place
other
than
the
charity,
then
it
is
going
to
make
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
raise
money
in
this
or
any
other
fashion,
because
the
amount
of
money
there
is
limited,
of
course,
while
the
number
of
charities
and
the
number
of
requests
continues
to
grow.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
and
all
of
that
is
provided
for,
your
honor.
if
that
is
a
reasonable
part
of
the
cost,
then
of
course
the
fee
is
allowed.
the
amount
can
go
up
to
100
percent
of
the
dollar,
and
that
is
no
problem
in
situations
such
as
your
honor
is
referring
to.
what
we
say
in
the
disclosure
aspects
is
simply
that
it
is
the
difference
between
what
you
take
in
and
what
you
take
out,
and
that
is
a
very
rational
reason.
you
pay
$20
for
a
meal,
sell
the
ticket
for
$25.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
that
you
are
effectively
chilling
the
rights
of
the
charity
to
be
heard,
and
that,
of
course,
is
the
interpretation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
i
recall
the
district
court's
decision,
there
was
simply
a
per
curiam
at
the
fourth
circuit
level,
he
said
that
it
was
questionable
as
to
whether
there
was
any
way
that
the
state
could
regulate
a
fundraiser
that
is
involved
in
solicitation
for
a
charity.
north
carolina's
position
is,
of
course,
that
this
is
a
commercial
operation,
and
that
we
do
have
regulatory
rights
under
police
power.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
your
honor.
when
a
challenge
occurs,
reasonableness
would
be
determined
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
your
honor.
we
look
at
it,
or
the
regulator--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
the
statute
sets
up
these
percentages,
20
percent--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--it
is
reasonableness
with
speech
aspect,
dissemination
of
information
and
so
forth,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
now,
you
see,
we
have
not
been...
first
of
all,
we
have
not
been
able
to
develop
any
rules
or
regulations
or
anything
else
dealing
with
this
broad
statutory
scheme
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
day
this
was
to
go
into
effect
they
came
in
with
a
restraining
order,
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
effective...
or
any
effort.
it
is
strictly
a
facial
attack.
no
application
has
been
made,
and
we
haven't
had
an
opportunity
to
get
into
the
details.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
reasonable
in
relation
to
all
the
facts
before
the
regulator,
the
hearing
officer,
your
honor.
all
the
evidence.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
there
are
minimum
require
your
honor,
dealing
with
speech
that
we
put
in
there
that
the
legislature
sets
out.
if
speech
is
involved,
dissemination
of
information
is
involved,
go
up
to
100
percent.
otherwise,
the
regulator
looks
at
all
the
facts,
and
justice
white's
example
would
be
a
good
example
of
the
fundraiser
would
come
in
and
lay
his
books
on
the
table
and
say,
look,
this
is
how
much
i
paid
for
that
meal.
there
would
be
no
contest
or
difficulty
with
that,
or
a
determination
or
a
detailed
explanation
of
reasonableness
or
unreasonableness.
it
would
be
obvious
what
the
answer
should
be.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
a
business
tax,
your
honor?
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
no,
your
honor,
it
is
an
effort
to--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--no,
your
honor,
we
give
them
special--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--yes,
sir,
we
do,
and
we
are
saying
that
these
fundraisers
who
are
going
out
and
getting
the
money
are
just
keeping
too
much
of
it,
and
we
want
more
of
it
to
go
back
to
the
charity,
and
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
say
your
costs
have
got
to
be
reasonable.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
there
are
a
variety
and
number.
i
think
the
largest--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--no,
i
don't
believe--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
national
federation
for
the
blind.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
because,
i
think
the
best
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
simply,
we
just
don't
have
the
problems
with
those
folks.
the
problems
are
with
the
fundraisers
who
work
for
hire,
for
profit.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
we
just
simply
in
north
carolina
don't
have
that
problem.
we,
as
i
understand
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
past,
we
can
attack
problems
piecemeal.
we
don't
have
to
solve
them
all
at
once.
this
is
a
problem
that
has
been
brought
to
our
attention,
and
the
legislature
has
responded.
if
the
churches
become
a
problem,
if
the
charities
become
a
problem,
then
we
can
deal
with
that.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
because
we
think...
first
of
all,
we
think
that
the
case
has
been
misrepresented
and
missold
to
the
charities.
in
munson
and
schaumburg
you
were
talking
about,
once
you
said...
if
you
don't
meet
this
25
percent
test,
then
you
don't
get
out
and
solicit,
and
this
cuts
off
all
of
your
avenues.
we
think
that
is
the
type
rationale
that
has
been
sold
to
these
charities
in
this
case,
and
it
is
just
the
opposite.
we
are
dealing,
for
example,
if
we
have
a
problem
with
one
for
hire
fundraiser.
all
of
the
rest
of
the
for
hire
fundraisers
are
still
there.
the
charity
can
continue
its
solicitation.
it
can
get
out
any
message
that
it
chooses.
it
can
use
its
officers,
its
members,
its
volunteers,
its
media,
all
of
the
rest.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
it
has
the
right
to
contract
and
then
the
donor,
the
attorney
general,
the
charity
has
a
right
to
contest
if
this
is
found
to
be
unreasonable
or
if
you
don't
have
these
formulas
involved.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
your
honor,
these...
the
state
of
north
carolina
stands
in
a
parens
patriae
relationship
in
regard
to
charitable
funds.
at
least
that
is
our
position.
states
since
the
1600s
i
think
in
england
have
been
trying
to
see
that
the
maximum
amount
of
these
funds
goes
to
the
charitable
purpose,
and
we
don't
think
the
charity
ought
to
have
the
unlimited
right.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
a
porch?
not--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--no,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
no,
i
think
we
are
regulating
at
the
right
place,
and
that
is
where
the
first
cut
comes,
and
we
are
simply
saying
that
the
charity...
that
we
are
regulating
a
commercial
operation.
we
are
not
trying
to
regulate
the
charity.
and
that
this
should
be
treated
as
a
control
or
an
attempt
to
control
the
commercial
operator
under
the
state's
police
power.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
yes.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
your
honor,
i
wish...
i
wish
we
could
control
the
television
ministries--
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
--but
i'm
not
sure
we
could
because
i
think,
of
course,
i
think
speech
rights
are
very
definitely
involved
totally
there,
and
you
have
the
problems
that,
yes,
that
would
be
involved,
but
we
are
not
trying
to
do
that.
we
are
only
trying
to
deal
at
this
point
with
one
aspect
of
a
problem,
and
we
feel
that
we
have
to
start
somewhere,
and
let
me
say
again
to
the
honorable
court
that
this
is
a
facial
attack
on
what
we
consider
to
be
a
valid
economic
regulatory
scheme,
and
that
the
charity's
speech
rights
would
be
only
minimally
impacted,
if
at
all,
and
that
the
heightened
scrutiny
test
of...
first
amendment
test
is
inapplicable,
and
the
minimum
rationality
test
is
that
which
should
be
used.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
in
this
instance?
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
no,
i
say
that
it
does
not
apply.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
no,
i
meant
to
say
that
we
say
the
heightened
scrutiny
test
does
not
apply.
the
minimum
rationality
test
does
apply.
mr.
lacy
h.
thornburg
nothing
further,
your
honor.
