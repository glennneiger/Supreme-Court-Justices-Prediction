justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
there
are
two
cuts
being
taken.
the
charity
itself
takes
a
cut
out
of
it
to
pay
salaries
and
expenses
before
giving
direct
relief,
and
if
they
rely
on
a
professional
fundraiser,
the
professional
fundraiser
takes
a
cut
for
himself
before
giving
anything
to
charity
for
which
another
cut
is
taken.
justice
o'connor
your
law
that
we
are
looking
at
relates
to
the
first
cut,
that
taken
by
the
professional
fundraiser.
justice
o'connor
i
suppose
we
look
at
it
under
the
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
sort
of
analysis?
is
that
what
we
do?
justice
o'connor
all
right.
now,
are
some
of
these
solicitations
made
for
little
things
like,
come
to
the
firemen's
relief
ball
or
the
police
ball
and
buy
a
$5
ticket?
and
they
do
this
on
the
telephone?
justice
o'connor
for
relatively
small
amounts.
buy
a
ticket
to
come
to
x
event.
justice
o'connor
on
behalf
of
some
charity.
justice
o'connor
and
north
carolina
thinks
that
having
the
telephone
caller,
if
it
is
a
professional
solicitor,
tell
the
person
being
called,
who
is
answering
the
telephone,
that
over
the
past
year,
is
it?
justice
o'connor
that
the
average
amount
that
this
particular
fundraiser
raised,
a
certain
percentage
was
kept
for
the
fundraiser's
fees
and
expenses?
justice
o'connor
that
is
sort
of
a
complicated
explanation,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
you
think
it
would
be
more
reasonable
to
have
the
person
just
disclose
that
it
is
a
professional
fundraiser
making
the
call
and
that
some
portion
of
it
will
be
retained
and
not
given
to
the
charity?
justice
o'connor
but
what
was
done
before
wouldn't
tell
you
what
is
going
to
happen
this
time,
would
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
copilevitz,
that,
of
course,
is
the
disclosure
section.
could
we
return
for
just
a
minute
to
the
limitation
on
fees
that
i
thought
we
were
discussing?
under...
as
i
understand
this
statute,
under
section
10(d)
the
fundraiser
can
charge
as
much
as
100
percent
of
the
gross
receipts
if
it
is
necessary
for
advocacy
reasons.
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
it
really
isn't
a
limitation
on
amount
that
can
be
collected
if
it
is
necessary
for
advocacy.
