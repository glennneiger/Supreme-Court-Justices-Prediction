justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
also
comes
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
it's
riley
versus
the
national
federation
of
the
blind
of
north
carolina.
the
question
for
decision
in
the
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
north
carolina
charitable
solicitations
act.
that
act
regulates
professional
fund
raising
and
defines
the
prima
facie
reasonable
fee
that
a
professional
fundraiser
may
charge
according
to
a
three-tiered
schedule.
a
fee
up
to
20%
of
receipts
collected
is
deemed
reasonable.
a
fee
between
20%
and
35%
is
deemed
unreasonable
upon
a
showing
that
the
solicitation
at
issue
did
not
involve
the
dissemination
of
information,
discussion,
or
advocacy
relating
to
public
issues
as
directed
by
the
charitable
organization
which
is
to
benefit
from
the
solicitation.
a
fee
exceeding
35%
is
presumed
unreasonable,
but
the
fundraiser
may
rebut
the
presumption
by
showing
that
the
fee
was
necessary
either
because
the
solicitation
involved
dissemination
of
information
or
advocacy
on
public
issues
directed
by
the
charity,
or
because
otherwise
the
charity's
ability
to
raise
money
or
communicate
would
be
significantly
diminished.
the
act
also
provides
that
a
professional
fundraiser
must
disclose
to
potential
donors
the
average
percentage
of
gross
receipts
actually
turned
over
to
charities
by
the
fundraiser
for
all
charitable
solicitations
conducted
in
the
state
within
the
previous
12
months.
and
finally,
the
act
provides
that
professional
fundraisers
may
not
solicit
without
an
approved
license,
whereas
volunteer
fundraisers
may
solicit
immediately
upon
submitting
a
licensed
application.
and
appellees,
a
coalition
of
professional
fundraisers,
charitable
organizations,
and
potential
donors,
brought
the
suit
against
the
appellant
government
officials
charged
with
enforcement
of
the
act
seeking
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
challenged
provisions
on
their
face
unconstitutionally
infringed
upon
freedom
of
speech
and
enjoined
their
enforcement.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
we
in
turn
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
north
carolina's
three-tiered
definition
of
reasonable
fees
unconstitutionally
infringes
upon
freedom
of
speech.
the
solicitation
of
charitable
contributions
is
protected
speech,
and
using
percentages
to
decide
the
legality
of
the
fundraiser's
fee
is
not
we
think
narrowly
tailored
to
the
state's
interest
in
preventing
fraud.
and
north
carolina's
requirement
to
professional
fundraisers
disclose
to
potential
donors,
before
an
appeal
for
funds,
percentage
of
charitable
contributions
collected
during
the
previous
12
months
that
were
actually
turned
over
to
charity
is
also
unconstitutional.
this
provision
of
the
act
is
a
content-based
regulation
because
mandating
speech
that
a
speaker
would
not
otherwise
make
necessarily
alters
the
speech's
content.
even
assuming
that
the
mandated
speech,
in
the
abstract,
is
merely
commercial,
it
does
not
retain
its
commercial
character
when
it
is
inextricably
intertwined
with
the
otherwise
fully
protected
speech
involved
in
charitable
solicitations,
and
thus
the
mandated
speech
is
subject
to
the
test
for
fully
protected
expression,
not
the
more
deferential
commercial
speech
principles.
finally,
north
carolina's
licensing
requirement
as
to
professional
fundraisers
is
unconstitutional.
speaker's
rights
are
not
lost
merely
because
compensation
is
received,
and
the
state's
asserted
power
or
licensed
professional
fundraisers
carries
with
it,
unless
properly
constrained
the
power
directly
and
substantially
to
affect
the
speech
they
utter.
consequently,
the
statute
is
subject
to
first
amendment
scrutiny.
generally,
speakers
need
not
obtain
a
license
to
speak
even
assuming
that
the
state's
interest
in
regulating
those
who
solicit
money
justifies
requiring
fundraisers
to
obtain
a
license
before
soliciting.
such
a
regulation
must
provide
that
the
licensor
will,
within
a
specified
brief
period,
either
issue
a
license
or
go
to
court.
that
requirement
is
not
met
here,
for
the
north
carolina
act
permits
a
delay
without
limit.
