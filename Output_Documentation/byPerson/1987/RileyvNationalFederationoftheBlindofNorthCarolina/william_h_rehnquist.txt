chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
randolph
riley,
etcetera,
et
al.
,
versus
national
federation
of
the
blind
of
north
carolina,
inc.,
et
al.
mr.
thornburg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
finish
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
at
1:00
o'clock.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
thornburg,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
thornburg.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
copilevitz.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
copilevitz,
do
you
think
a
state
could
regulate
the
price
of
theater
tickets,
put
a
maximum
price
on
theater
tickets,
or
do
you
think
the...
could
the
theater
object
that
you
are
suppressing
the
playwright's
free
speech
if
you
do
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
other
words,
you
don't
think
that
a
state
has
police
power
to,
say,
set
maximum
prices
for
bread
like
we
said
they
did
in
nebbia
versus
new
york,
and
cases
like
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
did
nebbia
say
anything
about
compelling
state
interest?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
i
mean,
i
asked
you
about
nebbia.
chief
justice
rehnquist
nebbia
just
said
it
is
within
the
police
power
of
the
state.
wouldn't
the
same
thing
apply
to
setting
a
maximum
price
for
theater
tickets?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
the
state
says
we
want
a
lot
of
people
to
be
able
to
go
to
the
theater,
just
like
we
want
a
lot
of
people
to
be
able
to
buy
bread.
that's
what
they
wanted
in
nebbia.
chief
justice
rehnquist
probably
a
lot
of
bucket
shop
operators
had
the
same
reaction
to
states
which
passed
blue
sky
laws
requiring
securities
disclosure.
they
wouldn't
work
in
those
states.
but
we
never
held
those
statutes
unconstitutional
because
the
bucket
shop
operators
complained.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
probably
the
corporations
that...
whose
stock
is
being
sold
by
bucket
shop
operators
could
mae
the
same
contention,
that
they
were
complaining,
they
didn't
like
the
blue
sky
laws,
either.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
copilevitz.
general
thornburg,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
