mr.
errol
copilevitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
value
of
speech
is
its
content,
not
its
source.
it
is
the
activity,
not
the
actor,
which
is
at
issue.
the
court
has
ruled
twice
in
this
decade
that
charitable
solicitation
is
entitled
to
full
first
amendment
protection.
it
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
indifference
whether
the
activity
is
carried
out
by
the
charity
directly
or
through
a
professional
representative.
charities
perform
many
vital
welfare
functions
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
and
its
citizenry.
the
state
seems
to
recognize
the
desirability
of
having
charities
function
in
north
carolina.
at
page
4
of
his
reply
brief,
the
attorney
general
makes
the
assertion
that
the
regulatory
scheme
at
bar
is
"pro-charity".
those
who
speak
for
the
charitable
community
would
answer
by
noting
that
if
it
is
the
aim
of
the
charity
to
help,
it
has
missed
by
a
wide
margin.
what
the
state
in
fact
has
done
is
to
create
a
statutory
scheme
based
upon
the
subjective
test
of
reasonableness
which
creates
a
very
real
and
present
danger
of
censorship.
the
pro-charity
claim
of
the
state
is
refuted
by
the
great
number
of
charities
that
have
joined
these
plaintiffs
as
amici.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
where
the
professional
representative
is
acting
as
a
conduit
or
an
agent
of
the
charitable
organization's
speech
it
is
not
possible
to
separate
that
out.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
i
think
the
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind,
and
the
important
consideration
is
the
message
of
the
charity,
and
when
a
professional
representative
is
speaking
for
the
charity,
taking
their
message
forward
and
seeking
financial
support,
he
is
also
involved
in
an
activity
that
includes
the
dissemination
of
information.
it
may
be
advocacy.
it
may
be
public
education.
his
putting
forward
the
message
of
the
charity
is
the
speech
of
the
charity,
and
in
that
instance
i
believe
that
it
is
entitled
to
the
highest
possible
speech.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
i
think--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--if
i
call
you
for
the
national
federation
of
the
plind
of
north
carolina,
i
am
calling
you
on
behalf
of
their
causes
and
what
they
represent,
and
if
you
know
what
those
causes
are
and
accept
what
they
represent
and
want
to
answer
with
your
financial
support,
i
think
we
have
been
involved
in
an
aspect
of
speech.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
no,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
what
i
am
saying.
i
am
saying
that
there
is
speech--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--but
this
court
has
ruled
in
both
schaumberg
and
munson
that
you
can
have
a
disclosure
by
registration
and
by
passing
certain
rigid
standards
to
quality
that
professional
to
act,
and
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
in
this
case
the
lower
court
held
that
it
was
not
a
burden
on
the
charity's
free
speech
right
to
have
that
person
identify
not
only
their
name
but
the
fact
that
they
were
a
professional,
giving
the
name
and
the
address
of
those
that
they
worked
for.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
well,
if
we
are
talking
about
the
licensing
of
the--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--professional
fundraiser,
the
licensing
provision
is
standardless,
and
the
court
invalidated
it
because
it
did
not
comply
with
shuttlesworth--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--there
were
certain
other
provisions
of
the
north
carolina
registration
requirements
for
professional
representatives
that
were
not
challenged,
that
are
still
on
the
books,
and
that
are
still
being
complied
with
by
professional
representatives.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
there
is
still
a
license
being
issued
and
granted
because
there
are
requirements
to
file
a
bond
and
file
certain
information,
and
this
provision
amended
an
existing
provision
that
required
the
providing
of
information,
the
filing
of
a
bond,
and
the
filing
of
financial
reports,
all
of
which
were
things
that
this
court
pointed
to
in
schaumberg,
and
that
is
what
is
in
place
in
north
carolina
today.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
i
don't
know
that
a
state
could
impose
a
maximum
price
on
a
theater
ticket
unless
there
was
a
given
consideration
that
was
a
substantial
state
interest
to
do
that.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
i
think
that
where
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--well,
in
this
case
we
are
dealing
with
a
speech
interest.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
no,
sir.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
it
would
depend
upon
what
the
state's
interest
in
doing
that.
if
we
were
coming
at
it
from
the
avenue
of
the
concern
of
the
free
speech
and
interstate
commerce
and
other
things,
i
think
it
would
be
problematical.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
i
think
in
that
circumstance
you
probably
could,
but
i
think
that
in
this
circumstance
where
we
are
dealing
with
the
burden
on
free
speech
there
are
other
considerations
at
hand.
i
would
like
to
go
back--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--no,
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
well,
this
court
has
held
twice
in
this
decade
that
this...
the
activity
of
charitable
solicitation
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
political
speech,
and
when
you
impact
that
you
take
different
considerations
into
effect
as
you
do
in
an
outright
commercial
situation,
and
the
impact
on
the
free
speech
interest
here
is
illustrated
by
the
example
that
the
court
made
earlier
this
morning
where
under
the
existing
north
carolina
law
if
it
were
not
challenged
and
i
were
calling
you
on
a
controversial
type
of
issue,
let's
say
contra
aid,
whether
i
am
for
it
or
against
it,
involving
an
organization
that
is
involved
in
advocacy
on
one
side
of
that
question
and
wants
financial
support
to
accomplish
some
of
the
goals
to
further
its
aims,
its
program
service,
when
i
call
you
under
this
law
as
it
is
written
i
have
to
begin
my
telephone
conversation
by
identifying
my
name,
the
name
of
the
company
that
i
work
for,
their
address,
what
their
track
record
was
for
the
preceding
12
months
of
delivering
funds
to
charitable
organizations
in
north
carolina--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--it
is--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--it
is
theoretically
possible.
practically
it
is
impossible.
what
will
happen
is,
those
who
are
the
professional
representatives,
if
they
are
faced
with
this
statute
knowing
that
the
burden
of
proof
shifts
once
35
percent
is
expired,
if
they
are
involved
in
a
special
event
that
includes
dissemination
of
information
about
the
national
federation
of
the
blind,
the
director
of
human
resources
has
no
guidelines
as
to
what
he
may
determine
as
to
both
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
and
the
statute
is
unclear
as
to
who
may
institute
a
complaint.
it
can
be
done
by
the
director
of
human
resources.
it
can
be
done
theoretically
by
any
resident
of
the
state
of
north
carolina.
and
if
he
does
this
hearing
and
the
burden
is
on
the
would-be
speaker
rather
than
the
would-be
censor,
and
if
the
director
of
human
resources
can
then
in
his
discretion
grant
a
judgment
against
the
professional
representative,
why
would
any
professional
representative
choose
to
work
in
the
state
of
north
carolina?
the
affidavits
of
the
plaintiffs,
who
are
two
individuals
that
have
worked,
have
said
that
they
would
not
work
in
north
carolina,
and
if
we
take
the
professional
representative
away
from
the
small
organization
that
needs
this
medium
to
reach
the
public
to
seek
support,
then
we
will
kill
the
small
charity
as
compared
to
their
ability
to
get
into
the
marketplace.
and
i
would
point
out
another
thing,
that
the
statute
and
this
statutory
scheme
is
a
most
clear
example
of
form
over
substance,
and
i
would
like
to
illustrate
that
to
the
court.
suppose
for
the
moment
that
there
is
an
issue
of
time
magazine
that
has
25
pages
on
the
contra
issue,
and
here
is
a
large
organization
that
can
buy
50,000
of
these
at
80
cents
apiece,
and
they
have
a
large
sales
force,
they
have
a
large
group
of
employees.
they
put
their
employees
on
the
phone,
and
they
call
up
people
and
say,
buy
this
magazine,
it
is
all
about
the
issue,
the
price
is
a
dollar,
and
they
make
20
cents
profit.
they
are
not
burdened
with
any
of
these
provisions.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
national
federation
of
the
blind,
who
does
not
have
the
manpower
or
the
expertise,
has
the
same
opportunity
in
a
commercially
viable
product
of
a
controversial
nature,
it
cannot
do
the
same
thing.
it
has
to
hire
someone
to
sell
those
magazines,
and
that
someone
is
going
to
want
some
money
for
their
effort.
and
so,
if
there
is
20
cents'
profit
and
they
divide
that
profit
evenly,
the
national
federation
of
the
blind
gets
their
message
out
and
everybody
is...
the
consumer
gets
the
same
product,
but
the
person
selling
it
for
the
national
federation
of
the
blind
has
to
go
through
this
litany
of
disclosures.
and
there's
even
more
in
the
north
carolina
law
by
administrative
law.
in
the
affidavit
filed
by
ed
edgerton
they
also
have
to
say
that
they
are
being
compensated
and
that
you
can
make
donations
directly
to
the
charity.
they
have
to
put
up
a
$20,000
bond,
and
then
they
face
the
uncertain
judgment
of
the
director
of
human
resources
as
to
whether
that
was
a
reasonable
expenditure.
dividing
the
20
cents
50-50,
was
that
reasonable?
was
paying
80
cents
for
the
magazine
reasonable?
who
knows
after
the
fact
what
he
is
going
to
determine?
who
knows
how
many
of
those
magazines
are
going
to
be
sold?
the
end
result
is
that
they
could
lose
money.
the
director
of
human
resources
could
say
it
is
unreasonable
and
enter
a
judgment
against
the
professional
to
protect
the
charity.
i
am
telling
you
the
professional
representatives
will
not
make
their
services
available
if
this
kind
of
statutory
regulation
is
allowed
to
stand.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
well,
if
they
are
staying
out
of
north
carolina
because
the
statutory
scheme
creates
a
prior
restraint,
it
is
the
charities
that
are
complaining.
it
is
the
charities
that
are
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
but
we
are
talking
about
them
as
a
class
of...
a
medium
for
a
certain
group,
a
certain
size
of
charitable
organizations,
and
this
certain
group
or
class
of
charitable
organizations
is
being
joined
by
the
larger
and
the
most
substantial
charitable
organizations
in
this
country.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
from
the
aspect
of
the
charity
are
talking
about
a
free
speech
interest
as
compared
to
a
commercial
speech,
and--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--well,
i
would
take
exception
with
the
example
and
illustrate
it
perhaps
by
the
zauderer
case,
which
the
state
has
relied
on
a
great
deal,
that
says
that
the
advertising
of
a
lawyer
can
be
regulated
as
to
his
client,
as
to
potential
clients.
the
state
of
north
carolina
again
already
has
a
statute
in
place
that
makes
a
professional
representative
advise
a
charity
in
advance
if
his
contract
is
going
to
exceed
more
than
50
percent.
once
the
lawyer
is
hired
by
the
client,
as
i
am
before
this
court
today,
i
believe
i
am
engaging
in
protected
expression
in
urging
my
client's
point
here
today.
but
if
i
choose
to
run
an
advertisement
next
week
to
attract
potential
new
clients,
then
i
am
engaging
in
commercial
speech.
the
professional
fundraiser,
to
the
extent
that
he
seeks
to
attract
business
from
charities,
is
engaged
in
commercial
speech.
to
the
extent
that
he
wants
to
do
business
in
north
carolina,
he
can
be
subjected
to
reasonable
and
rational
and
definitive
legislation
and
reporting
requirements
but
where,
and
once
he
has
that
client--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--i
don't
think
that
is
possible.
i
think
that
one
is
a
conduit
of
free
speech.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
i
think
i
will
decline.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
by
affidavit
have
expressed
very
real
and
legitimate
concerns.
their
assertions
remain
unrefuted.
unlike
the
larger,
more
substantial
groups,
these
groups
cannot
rely
on
media
advertising,
door-to-door
or
telephone
solicitation
without
the
help
of
professional
representatives
and
be
financially
successful.
they
lack
name
recognition,
they
lack
expertise,
they
lack
the
manpower.
these
challenged
provisions
make
the
availability
of
those
services
to
them
most
unlikely
and
in
our
view
impossible.
no
one
seeks
to
avoid
the
right
of
a
prospective
donor
to
inquire.
no
one
ask
that
misrepresentation
be
allowed.
and
indeed,
north
carolina,
even
without
these
challenged
provisions,
has
the
most
substantial
disclosure
provisions
of
any
state
in
this
country.
in
spite
of
protestations
to
the
contrary,
the
concept
of
disclosure
itself
is
not
at
issue.
the
main
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
matters
that
this
court
was
confronted
with
in
both
the
maryland
statute
in
munson
and
the
village
of
schaumburg
ordinance
in
schaumburg
was
that
this
disclosure
goes
to
content
of
speech.
the
disclosure
that
was
talked
about
in
schaumburg
and
munson
was
a
disclosure
of
public
record.
there
are
three
kinds
of
disclosure.
there
is
government-compelled
disclosure,
which
is
the
filing
of
registrations,
the
obtaining
of
licenses,
the
bonds,
the
financial
report.
there
is
the
disclosure
upon
request,
north
carolina
as
a
part
of
these
amended
statutes...
or,
excuse
me,
prior
to
these
amended
statutes,
still
on
the
books
and
unchallenged,
is
a
state
statute
that
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
not
to
disclose
upon
request
by
a
citizen
of
north
carolina
in
writing,
giving
a
full
financial
report.
that
remains
on
the
books.
the
third
type
of
disclosure
is
a
compelled
disclosure
to
every
prospective
donor.
the
north
carolina
legislation
had
three
separate
parts.
the
trial
court
found
that
it
was
not
an
undue
burden
to
require
the
disclosure
of
the
name,
to
require
the
disclosure
of
the
name
of
the
professional
company
and
the
fact
of
employment.
they
did
find
that
it
was
an
undue
burden
to
disclose
the
track
record
of
the
professional
for
the
preceding
12
months,
calling
it
irrelevant.
it
also...
the
court
raised
the
question
rhetorically
that
if
the
interest--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--what
burdens
the
first
amendment
rights
is
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
face
to
face
solicitation,
or
telephone
solicitation,
as
this
court
said
in
members
of
the
city
council
of
los
angeles
versus
benson,
that
face
to
face
solicitation
and
telephone
is
entitled
to
extra
consideration
because
of
the
nature
of
the
activity.
it
is
the
most
accessible
to
the
smaller
and
the
less
financially
able.
it
is
the
most
delicate
speech-wise,
and
when--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--so
that
when
the
state
requires
me
that
in
addition
to
being
able
and
before
i
can
give
the
message
of
those
i
represent
i
have
to
tell
you
my
name,
the
name
of
the
company
i
work
for,
their
address,
and
what
that
company's
track
record
is
for
the
preceding
12
months,
by
the
time
that
i
get
to
talk
to
you
about
the
message
of
the
national
federation
of
the
blind
and
their
interest
in
advocacy
on
the
right
of
blind
citizens,
i
will
have
received
a
dial
tone.
that
is
the
burden
on
the
first
amendment
interest
of
the
national
federation
of
the
blind.
that
is
why
this
case
was
filed.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
i
don't
think
that
there
is
the
same
constitutional
problem.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
limit
to
what
you
can
require
a
charity
or
those
who
represent
them
to
disclose.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
if
you
could
not
get
the
information
you
would
hang
up.
but
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
method
or
manner
of
how
we
deliver
that
information
to
the
prospective
donor.
if
we
allow
the
charity
to
choose
a
context
of
its
message,
i
think
we
can
require
the
charity
to
disclose
all
types
of
matters,
including
financial.
the
other,
contrary
to
the
fact
assumption
of
this
particular
type
of
statute,
is
that
summary
financial
information
somehow
measures
the
true
worth
of
a
charity,
and
that
simply
is
not
so.
this
court
has
ruled
that
high
costs
are
not
a
measure
of
fraud
or
indeed
the
worth
of
a
charity.
charities
have
high
costs
for
a
number
of
different
reasons.
the
worth
of
a
charity
involves
its
program
service,
its
message,
its
past
performance,
its
plans,
and
yes,
to
some
extent
its
financial
efficiency,
but
there
are
a
number
of
considerations
that
we
want
people
to
consider
before
they
part
with
their
money,
and
in
order
to
give
them
all
of
that
information,
the
charity
should
be
allowed
to
choose
a
context.
there
are
other
states,
like
new
york,
that
require
a
written
disclosure
on
all
materials
that
go
out
in
the
mail
that
says
you
may
obtain
additional
financial
information
by
writing
to
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state,
and
it
gives
you
a
mailing
address.
the
state
of
west
virginia
has
a
comparable
written
provision.
these
are
notice
disclosure
provisions,
and
i
believe
that
they
are
constitutional.
it
says
to
people,
you
can
find
out
more
if
you
want,
and
it
allows
the
charity
to
go
into
the
marketplace
of
ideas
and
support
and
deliver
its
message
without
having
to
dilute
its
message
with
summary
financial
information
that
is
inherently
inaccurate.
we
have
attached
a
copy
of
a
financial
position
paper
issued
by
the
american
institute
of
certified
public
accountants
to
illustrate
that
whenever
you
deal
with
a
summary
financial
figure,
whether
it
is
percentages
as
to
the
costs
or
whether
it
is
the
percentage
on
the
track
record,
you
are
dealing
with
allocations.
fundraising
is
never
carried
on
in
a
vacuum.
the
charity
receives
more
than
dollars.
it
receives
the
benefit
of
having
its
name
increased
by
awareness
in
the
community.
it
may
get
mailings
sent
out.
it
may
get
a
number
of
services.
how
you
allocate
the
goods
that
the
charity
receives
is
critical.
how
the
director
of
human
resources
decides
whether
a
cost
is
20
percent
or
35
percent
is
absolutely
critical.
the
purpose
of
including
the
document
in
the
appendix
was
to
illustrate
the
absolute
imprecise
nature
of
non-for
profit
accounting,
that
you
measure
functions.
it
is
possible
to
send
you
a
letter
and
have
that
letter
be
two
pages,
and
one-and-three-quarters
pages
of
that
letter
deal
with
the
program
service
of
the
national
federation
of
the
blind,
and
the
last
paragraph
of
that
letter
says,
if
you
like
what
you
hear,
if
you
think
we
are
worthy,
we
want
your
support.
now,
what
portion
of
those
expenses
are
allocable
to
fundraising
expenses
and
what
portion
is
allocable
to
program
service?
what
did
the
charity
really
get?
they
got
more
than
money.
they
got
increased
name
recognition.
they
delivered
a
program
service.
i
am
standing
before
this
court
telling
you
i
have
had
this
argument
with
accountant
after
accountant,
state
after
state.
there
is
no
precise
answer.
it
is
a
subjective
area.
and
when
we
deal
with
presumtually
protected
speech,
and
particularly
here,
speech
that
is
analogous
to
political
speech,
core
speech
is
entitled
to
the
highest
protection
that
the
constitution
allows,
and
subjective
criteria
is
not
suitable
to
determine
whether
someone
has
the
right
to
speak
or
not
to
speak.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
i
don't
believe
that
written
disclosure
is
harmful
at
all.
i
believe
that--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--if
it
only
was
required
to
be
given
in
writing,
even
before
a
person
parted
with
consideration--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--i
don't
believe
that
that
creates
the
constitutional
problems
that
point
of
solicitation
oral
disclosure--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--but
what
it
does
is,
it
gives
the
charity
a
chance
to
explain
figures
and
amplify.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
it
gives
them
the
context
of
allowing
you
to
understand
what
it's
all
about,
and
that
form
the
charity
needs
because
worthy
charities
have
high
costs,
and
if
they
have
to
start
by
telling
you
that
they
have
high
costs,
and
that
professionals
are
involved,
and
all
these
other
things,
they
are
never
going
to
receive
your
support.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
well,
i
think
what
the
attorney
general
said
is
that
they
picked
out
five
particular
professional
fundraisers
and
as
to
those
five
the
studies
showed
20
percent.
the
question
here
is
compounded--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--i
don't
know
what
the
overall
record
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
would
show.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
this
is
in
the
record
as
to,
i
believe,
five
different
companies.
it
is
not
the
record
of
every
charity
and
every--
mr.
errol
copilevitz
--i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
records
also
show
from
mr.
edgerton's
deposition
that
there's
many
times
the
number
of
five
professional
fundraising
representatives
that
are
licensed
to
work
in
the
state
of
north
carolina,
and
that
north
carolina
would
be
better
served
to
enforce
its
existing
statutes
and
require
the
disclosure
of
professional
fundraisers
to
the
charities
as
to
what
kind
of
track
record
they
have.
that's
where
the
meaningful
part
is,
not
to
the
prospective
donor.
mr.
errol
copilevitz
i
am
willing
to
live
with
the
introductory
part.
i
am
willing
to
tell
you
my
name
as
the
court
has
required
that
i
must
do
and
give
you
notice
of
the
fact
that
i
somehow
am
a
professional
representative.
i
think
that
those
are
fine,
and
the
court
so
found.
what
i
find
difficult
and
impossible
to
live
with
is
then
including
some
summary
financial
figure,
and
in
this
case
the
summary
financial
figure
has
no
relevance
necessarily
to
the
charity
that
i
am
calling
for.
i
may
have
as
a
professional
representative
never
dealt
with
this
charity,
and
my
experience
may
be
totally
irrelevant
to
my
current
experience
with
this
charity
and
my
contract.
thank
you.
