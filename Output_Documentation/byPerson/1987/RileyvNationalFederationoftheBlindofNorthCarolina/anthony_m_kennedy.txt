justice
kennedy
--reasonableness
is
determined
on
a
case
by
case
basis?
justice
kennedy
what
happens
if
a
charity
has
high
hopes
but
the
fundraising
thing
is
something
of
a
flop?
it
gives
the
dinner
that
mr.
justice
white
talked
about
and
nobody
comes.
or
it
has
a
big
television
advertising
campaign
and
nothing
happens.
you
judge
after
the
fact
whether
the
expense
was
reasonable?
justice
kennedy
are
there
any
statutory
criteria
for
reasonableness?
justice
kennedy
and
what
are
they?
justice
kennedy
i
understand
the
percentages,
but
other
than
that
the
only
touchstone
is
reasonableness?
justice
kennedy
but
the
statute
doesn't
even
say
reasonable
in
relation
to
what?
reasonable
in
relation
to
the
amount
obtain?
reasonable
in
relation
to
the
difficulty
of
the
message?
justice
kennedy
but
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations
must
be
neutral
and
can't
afford
the...
any
latitude
for
discretion,
and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
an
open-ended
standard.
