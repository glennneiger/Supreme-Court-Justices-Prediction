doesn't
this
approach,
though,
make
it
awfully
tough
on
the
charities
who
rely
on
expensive
events
to
raise
their
money?
they
may
give
a
dinner,
and
they
may
only
get
$10
a
head,
but
it
costs
them
an
awful
lot
of
money.
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
the
basis
for
the
invalidation
was
the
first
amendment,
is
that
it,
in
the
court
below?
justice
white
and
what
was
the
argument,
that
disclosure
burdens
first
amendment
rights?
is
that--
justice
white
--by
saying
i...
if
last
year
my
experience
was
so
and
so--
justice
white
could
i
ask
you,
is
it
feasible
in
your
mind
to
separate
the
professional
fundraisers
who
help
the
charities
get
their
message
out
and
those
who
just
raise
money?
justice
white
well,
the
charity
hires
a
professional
fundraiser
to
raise
some
money.
say
it
is
an
annual
basis,
annual
basis.
you
don't...
you
think
any
time
a
professional
raises
money
for
a
charity,
that
it
is
distributing
the
message
of
the
charity
and
should
be
treated
in
that
manner?
justice
white
just
asking
for
money?
justice
white
i
get
telephone
calls
that
say,
i
am
calling
for
a
certain
organization.
i
know
the
organization.
they
never
tell
me
a
thing
about
it.
this
is
the
annual
campaign
for
x.
i
am
familiar
with
it.
they
never
say
a
word.
i
know
what
it's
all
about.
i
give
them
some
money.
now,
is
that--
justice
white
--you
are
arguing
then
that
there
is
no,
there
is
just
no
situation
in
which
the
restrictions
may
be
applied,
for
instance,
the
licensing
provision
could
not
be
applied
to
any
professional
fundraisers
for
a
charity?
justice
white
well,
here
is
a
professional
fundraiser
for
a
charity.
now,
you
say
every
time
they
raise
money
for
a
charity
it
is
furthering
the
message
of
the
charity
and
it
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
you
can't
have
a
prior
restraint.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
that
isn't
all
that
this
north
carolina
scheme
does
in
licensing,
does
it?
justice
white
that's
what
i
am.
justice
white
all
right.
so
you
say
there
is
no
professional
fundraiser
for
a
charity
in
north
carolina
that
may
be
subjected
to
the
licensing
provision
because
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
white
what
about
the
licensing
provisions?
justice
white
if
you
are
going
to
rely
on
the
first
amendment
how
did
it
infringe
first
amendment
rights?
anything
that
was
irrelevant
burden.
first
amendment
rights?
justice
white
so?
justice
white
i
would
think...
i
would
think
you
would
challenge
on
the
same
grounds,
the
requirement
that
you
give
that
information
if
it
is
required.
i
mean,
if
it
is
asked
for,
if
it
is
asked
for
by
the
person
you
are
soliciting.
justice
white
after
all,
if
you...
i
guess
then
you
could
just
hang
up
if
you
didn't
want
to
give
the
information,
i
guess.
