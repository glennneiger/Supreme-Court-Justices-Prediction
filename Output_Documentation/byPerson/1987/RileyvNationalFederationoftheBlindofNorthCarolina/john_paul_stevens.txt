justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
stevens
justice
blackmun
asked
about
the
religious
exemption,
and
this...
one
of
the
interests
you
seek
to
serve
is
that
the
donor
know
how
much
of
the
donation
will
go
to
the
charity.
why
isn't
that
interest
equally
implicated
in
these
television
ministries
and
the
like?
justice
stevens
well,
why
couldn't
this--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
if
your
argument
applies
equally
to
telephone...
i
know
in
the
strongest
context
over
the
telephone
because
people
probably
hang
up
pretty
fast,
but
what
about
a
written
disclosure?
why
is
that
so
harmful,
because
you
can
add
a
further
explanation
in
the
written
material.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
this
would
be
all
right
if
applied
merely
to
written
solicitations?
justice
stevens
and
even
to
the
donor,
not
just
to
a
central
place
where
they
can
call
up
and
get
the
information.
justice
stevens
if
he
is
telling
us
the
truth,
and
i
certainly
assume
he
is,
it
is
the
five
largest
for
profit
professional
fundraisers
licensed
between
1980
and
1984
in
north
carolina,
the
five
largest.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
go
back?
your
principal
concern
is
either
telephone
or
in
person
solicitation,
isn't
it,
to
people
who
have
not
met
before
or
communicated
before?
you
don't
want
the
introductory
conversation
to
include
this
information.
