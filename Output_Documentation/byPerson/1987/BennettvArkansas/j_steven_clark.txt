mr.
j.
steven
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
submit
to
this
court
that
this
case
is
a
rather
simple
one
in
the
sense
that
the
congress
in
enacting
the
social
security
administration
act
with
retirement
benefits
said
that
its
purpose
was
to
provide
for
the
food,
clothing
and
necessary
shelter
for
people
who
were
approaching
advancing
age
and
not
to
have
them
experience
the
rigors
of
poverty.
the
arkansas
statute
adopted
in
1981
really
in
a
very
direct
respect
had
that
same
purpose.
it
was
furtherance
of
a
logical
purpose
and
goal
for
our
state
that
was
to
see
that
felons,
those
guilty
of
felonious
conduct,
could
not
get
windfall
benefits
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
while
they
were
being
taken
care
of,
their
total
care
and
maintenance
being
provided
by
the
state,
that,
in
fact,
while
that
occurred,
that
they
should
not
receive
any
windfall
benefits
and
that
those
benefits
should
be
applied
in
the
nature
and
form
of
a
reimbursement
if,
in
fact,
what
arkansas
was
doing
was
what
the
congress
intended
to
have
done
with
those
retirement
benefits.
i
submit
to
you
that's
what
happened
in
this
case
with
petitioner
bennett.
petitioner
bennett,
as
you
have
been
told,
committed
second
degree
murder
and
was
sentenced
to
twenty-one
years
in
our
institution.
in
1982,
he
turned
sixty-two.
he
voluntarily
and
without
any
compulsion
from
our
state
applied
for
retirement
benefits.
we
adopted
a
statute
in
1981
recognizing
what
we
thought
was
a
bad
public
policy
of
committing
such
windfalls.
in
1983,
arkansas
acting
as,
i
submit
to
you,
the
state
has
the
power
to
act,
decided
to
try
to
recoup
from
petitioner
bennett
$4,000
that
he
had
in
terms
of
assets
in
contrast
to
some
$27,000
that
we
had
spent
for
his
cost
of
incarceration.
our
statute
specifically
says
this:
reimbursement
costs
for
food,
clothing,
shelter,
medical
and
normal
living
expenses
to
the
per
capita
amount
that
is
to
have
been
expended
on
that
person
incarcerated
in
just
a
correctional
facility.
it
does
not
permit
us
to
collect
above
that
amount.
in
the
instance
of
petitioner
bennett,
had
he
left
our
institution
with
$35,000
and
we
had
been
able
to
collect
$27,000,
he
would
have
had
an
$8,000
check
presented
to
him
at
the
time
of
his
departure.
it
goes
to
exactly
the
amount
that
we,
in
fact,
expend
as
a
per
capita
cost,
which
i
submit
to
this
court
is
consistent
with
what
the
congress
came
back
around
to
do
in
1983.
when
the
congress
said
in
its
amendments
to
the
social
security
act
as
to
retirement
benefits,
that,
in
fact,
that
is
a
windfall,
and
that
windfall
should
not
occur.
since
that
time,
as
you
know,
the
congress
has
made
sure
that
those
benefits
do
not
flow.
in
the
instance
of
petitioner
bennett,
there
was
a
mistake
made
by
the
social
security
administration
and
by
the
state
of
arkansas.
we
stand
ready
here
to
tell
this
court
we
will
rectify
that
mistake
if
there
has
been
any
over-payment
collected
by
us
to
which
we
owe
the
social
security
administration.
in
fact,
until
these
briefs
were
filed
with
the
court,
we
simply
were
not
aware
of
that.
i
should
tell
you
the
state
was
not,
but
we
stand
ready
to
say
that
if
there's
been
an
over-payment
and
we've
gotten
a
windfall
benefit,
it's
our
responsibility
then
to
make
the
social
security
administration
whole.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
for
retirement
benefits,
yes,
your
honor.
i
concede
we
cannot
recoup
from
social
security
retirement
benefits.
in
fact,
there
is
a
department
memo
that
says
any
social
security
retirement
checks
that
are
received
by
the
department
are
to
be
returned
to
the
social
security
administration.
we
only
have
forty-five
inmates
in
our
system,
your
honor,
who
are
over
the
age
of
sixty-two
at
this
point.
our
median
age
is
about
twenty-eight
years
in
our
correctional
system.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
very
cut
and
dry.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
think
not.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i
think
the
difference
in
the
hypothetical
you
have
offered
and
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
that
you've
done
that
by
a
matter
of
choice.
on
the
arkansas
statutory
scheme,
we
have
an
obligation
to
provide
that
food,
care,
shelter
and
normal
living
expenses
and
medical
expenses
to
an
inmate
in
our
system.
but
even
if
we
chose
as
state
policy
to
repeal
that
mandatory
statutory
scheme,
we
have
a
constitutional
responsibility.
the
district
courts
of
these
united
states
have
repeatedly
told
us
in
a
lot
of
litigation,
some
of
which
has
come
to
this
court,
called
huddell
v.
finney,
what
that
responsibility
is
constitutionally
under
the
eighth
amendment,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
how
it's
applied
in
terms
of
that
total
care
and
maintenance.
so,
i
think
you
can
distinguish
and
there's
a
distinction
in
the
hypothetical
in
the
sense
that
in
yours,
your
honor,
you
have
voluntarily
accepted
that
responsibility.
in
ours,
it
is
an
obligation
that's
constitutionally
mandated
which
we
must
live
up
to.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
think
not.
i
think
again
the
distinction
in
this
case
is
that
in
the
instance
of
petitioner
bennett,
when
he
voluntarily
committed
a
criminal
act
and
became
a
part
of
our
system,
we
had
a
constitutional
responsibility.
we
stood
in
his
place
in
the
instance
that
what
we
did
was
fulfill
the
intent
of
congress
in
a
very
narrow
window
of
time,
from
june
of
'81
to
may
of
'83.
in
fact,
there
were
only
two
cases
of
social
security
retirement
benefits
which
the
state
attempted
to
attach
in
that
period
of
time,
and
only
in
the
instance
of
a
person
incarcerated
in
a
penal
facility
in
my
state.
the
statute
does
not
go
beyond
that.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i
think,
your
honor,
when
you
look
at
the
plain
language,
you
have
to
look
at
the
test
that
i
think
is
specifically
identified
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
which
says
that
you
look
at...
that
our
case
is
not
barred.
our
statute
is
not
deemed
to
be
unconstitutional
because
you
look
at
the
language
and
the
purpose
to
formulate
the
intent.
it's
language
plus
that
gets
to
what
the
intent
was.
congress--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--well,
your
honor,
this
court
in
rose
v.
rose
could
have
taken
that
very
same
approach
but
did
not.
this
court
could
have
said
the
plain
language
says
no
letting,
no
attachment,
you
can't
do
that.
this
court
didn't
say
that.
this
court
said,
well,
wait
a
minute,
there's
a
legitimate
purpose
being
advanced.
that
is,
the
state
has
the
power
and
the
duty
to
advance
laws
concerning
domestic
relations.
i
submit
to
you
that
that's
the
same
in
the
area
of
corrections
and
criminal
law.
that
the
state
of
arkansas
in
1981
had
legitimate
power
and
authority
to
advance
a
purpose,
to
say
that
it
was
wrong
for
a
felon
to
be
the
windfall
beneficiary
of
his
criminal
acts,
and
in
that
instance,
we
adopted
a
statute
that
in
its
application
applied
to
the
estate
of
those
persons
incarcerated
for
their
tangible
and
intangible
benefits
or
assets
to
include
social
security.
after
those
'83
amendments,
we
specifically
said
you
cannot
or
you
no
longer
can
stand
in
the
place
of
that
recipient
because
what
we
had
done
prior
to
that
was
simply
say
we
were
doing
what
the
congressional
intent
was
from
the
beginning.
we
were
giving
the
total
care
and
maintenance
for
this
individual.
in
fact,
frankly,
we
did
more
than
that,
but
that's
not
the
test.
the
test
is
were
we
doing
what
the
congress
wanted
done,
and
i
submit
to
you
that
we
did,
and
we
constitutionally
could
do
that
in
terms
of
defining
our
own
roles
and
purpose
for
criminal
law
and
corrections.
this
case
is
one
in
which
i
submit
to
you
that
it's
nothing
more
than
a
traditional
role
of
the
state
acting
in
an
area
where
the
state
has
the
power
to
act.
because
our
state
formed
this
policy
with
this
purpose,
if
you're
going
to
commit
a
felonious
act
and
you're
going
to,
because
of
that,
become
a
burden
to
the
state
and
its
taxpayers,
they
should
not
have
to
suffer
that
burden
if,
in
fact,
they
fulfill
what
was
in
this
small
window
of
time
the
intent
of
congress
in
providing
for
these
total
care
and
maintenance
of
these
inmates.
this
policy
adopted
by
arkansas
was
consistent
with
the
later
amendments.
you
might
say
to
some
degree,
we're
just
twenty-four
months
ahead
of
our
time,
that
congress
came
back
and
said
you're
right,
this
is
a
windfall
and
it's
wrong.
so,
in
this
small
window,
the--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct,
and
the
congress
said
that's
our
and
they
did
say
the
state
should
not
receive
it,
that
that
should
stay
in
the
social
security
trust
fund.
i
admit
that
readily.
but
what
i
would
also
say
to
you
is
that
the
congress
didn't
prohibit
that
prior
to
the
'83
amendments.
when
they
came
back
in
'83,
they
got
very
specific.
no
longer
will
the
retirement
benefits
flow,
no
longer.
disability.
they
will
only
flow
if,
in
fact,
the
person
who
has
received
a
disability
benefit
has
these
things
which
will
occur:
(1)
the
program
was
specifically
approved
by
the
court,
(2)
that
the
person
would
get
training
that
when
they
were
released
would
give
them
gainful
employment.
it
was
not
the
sixty-two-year
old
person
we're
talking
about.
thirty-five
year
old
person
they
were
talking
about.
and
(3)
the
congress
said
that
in
the
instance
you
have
to
have
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
released
shortly
so,
in
fact,
this
training
will
benefit
you.
congress
was
very
explicit,
but
prior
to
those
'83
amendments,
the
congressional
intent,
i
think,
was
not
frustrated
at
all
by
the
arkansas
statute
at
all.
in
fact,
i
would
say
to
this
court
that
this
case
is
distinguished
from
philpott
and
in
the
instance
that
philpott,
there
was
a
voluntary
duty
and
one
that
was
conditioned.
our
response
is
not
conditioned.
in
the
philpott
case,
you
found
with
that
statute
that
the
person
who
received
the
benefits
at
the
time
the
benefits
were
granted
were
told
upon
this
condition,
you
shall
receive.
that's
not
what
our
statute
says.
statutory
in
terms
of
corrections
or
that's
not
what
the
courts
of
these
united
states
have
taught
us
about
corrections
in
terms
of
care
and
maintenance
of
inmates.
it's
not
upon
a
condition
that
you
happen
to
be
under
thirty-five,
you'll
get
this
sort
of
treatment,
or
over
sixty-two,
that
sort
of
treatment.
it
is,
in
fact,
you
will
get.
it
is
an
obligation
constitutionally
and
statutorily
founded.
and,
so,
i
think
this
case
is
distinguished,
can
be
distinguished
from
philpott.
i
also
would
simply
say
to
the
court
that
in
looking
at
this
case,
that
the
petitioner
would
have
you
believe
that
it
should
be
disposed
of
very
easily
by
just
looking
at
that
plain
language
and
that
really
isn't
a
case
at
bar
here
today,
and,
yet,
i
submit
that's
not
correct.
that's
not
the
test
this
court
articulated
in
rose
v.
rose.
that's
really
not
the
test
that
the
sg
brief
even
says
it
is.
it
says,
and
i
quote,
"it's
equally
clear
the
validity
of
a
challenged
state
law
turns
on
(1)
its
consistency
with
congressional
language
but
(2)
its
purpose.
"
the
arkansas
state
statute
from
1981
to
1983
did
not
frustrate
congressional
purpose,
and
as
in
the
case
of
rose
v.
rose,
if
you
just
stop
and
say,
levy
attached
on
so
forth,
we
can't
go
any
further,
we
would
be
precluded
by
the
supremacy
clause.
but
this
court
didn't
do
that
in
rose
v.
rose.
this
court
said,
wait
a
minute.
there
is
a
legitimate
state
purpose
advance,
and
i
say
again,
i
submit
that
that's
what
we
were
doing
with
that
statute.
our
statute
is
broader
than
just
social
security
retirement
benefits.
it
has
been
applied
in
some
thirty-five
instances
and
in
all
those,
only
two
in
which
social
security
retirement
benefits
were
included.
many
of
the
people,
not
many,
thirty-five
out
of
3100,
let's
get
the
numbers
very
specific,
thirty-five
out
of
3100
inmates
have
some
value
which
we
felt
we
could
be
reimbursed
from.
procedure
is
very
simple
in
arkansas.
when
you
are
sentenced
to
the
arkansas
department
of
corrections,
you
spend
fourteen
days
in
processing.
we
hand
you
a
sheet
of
paper.
we
ask
you
to
fill
out
the
information
sheet.
it
says,
do
you
have
any
assets.
if
you
say
none,
that's
the
end
of
it.
we
don't
have
the
staff
or
the
manpower
to
go
looking
any
further.
if,
in
the
instance
of
while
you
are
incarcerated,
we
seek
reimbursement
for
$4,000
and
then
you
are
released
as
petitioner
bennett,
we
don't
come
back
with
a
deficiency
claim.
we're
not
a
judgment
creditor.
we
don't
do
this
by
choice,
we
do
it
by
obligation.
in
the
instance
of
mr.
bennett,
if
he
has
a
great
aunt
who
dies
and
leaves
him
$5
million,
we
don't
come
back
again.
we
simply
say
during
the
period
of
the
time
that
you
were
incarcerated
in
our
institution,
you
should
not
be
a
burden
to
the
taxpayer
in
the
instance
that
you
have
resources
which
we
have
a
right
to
be
reimbursed
to
up
to
the
per
capita
cost
of
what
we
expend
keeping
you
there
because
of
your
conduct
which
mandated
you
be
there.
i
finally
would
simply
say
this
to
the
court,
that
the
arkansas
reimbursement
statute
doesn't
frustrate
any
purpose
or
intent
of
congress,
and
that,
in
fact,
we
really
fulfill
that
purpose
and
we
have
not
created
any
sort
of
hardship,
we
have
not
created
direct
challenge
to
federal
authority.
our
statute
does
not
pose
a
serious
threat
to
federalism.
that's
not
our
statute
at
all,
and
because
of
that,
i
would
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
