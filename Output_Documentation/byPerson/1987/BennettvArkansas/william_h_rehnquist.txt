chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
86-6124,
george
s.
bennett
v.
arkansas.
mr.
carpenter,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
will
happen
if
monetarily,
if
this
court
reverses
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
what
will
mr.
bennett
get?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
if
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
by
arkansas,
the
state
of
arkansas
will
get
that
$3,600?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
carpenter.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
lazarus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazarus.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
general
clark.
chief
justice
rehnquist
really,
all
you
have
shown
so
far,
it
seems
to
me,
general
clark,
is
that
perhaps
if
congress
had
thought
about
this,
it
would
have
said
that
arkansas'
situation
would
be
an
exception
to
the
anti-assignment
statute,
but
you've
got
the
flat
language
of
the
anti-assignment
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
really,
the
spoken
word,
the
language,
if
it's
clear
that
that
doesn't
leave
a
whole
lot
of
room
for
something
else.
chief
justice
rehnquist
congress
also
said
you're
wrong
in
thinking
you
get
it,
we
get
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
clark.
mr.
carpenter,
you
have
ten
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
carpenter.
the
case
is
submitted.
