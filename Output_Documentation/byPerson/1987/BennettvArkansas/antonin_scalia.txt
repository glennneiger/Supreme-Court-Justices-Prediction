justice
scalia
i
guess
i
still
don't
understand.
will
he
get
money
or
are
you
challenging
the
post-1983
money
as
well?
justice
scalia
well,
post-may
'83,
he
shouldn't
have
received
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
your
complaint
is
that
the
state
should
not
have
taken
them.
i
mean,--
justice
scalia
--and,
therefore,
there
should
be
no
over-payment
charged
against
his
future
payments.
right?
you're
saying
the
state
should
return
the
over-payment
rather
than
his
returning
the
over-payment.
justice
scalia
but
you're
not
saying
he
was
entitled
to
any
money
after
1983,
you're
just
saying
he
shouldn't
be
charged
after
he
was
released
for
payments
which
he
never
received
post-1983.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
what
should
go
to
him
is
not
the
money
between
may
of
'83
and
the
time
he
was
released.
that's
not
what
should
go
to
him.
what
you're
really
asking
for
is
the
money
that
should
have
gone
to
him
after
his
release.
you're
saying
there
shouldn't
have
been
any
charges
against
that
money.
you
don't
claim
any
entitlement
on
his
part
to
money
between
may
of
'83
and
the
time
he
was
released.
you
do
not
claim
he
was
entitled
to
any
money
then,
do
you?
justice
scalia
i'm
glad
to
hear
what
you've
just
said,
general
clark,
because
i
couldn't
see
why
this
amount
should
be
in
dispute
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
pretty
cut
and
dried.
justice
scalia
now,
as
to
the
rest
of
it,
suppose
i
provide...
suppose
my
elderly
parents
live
with
me
and
i
provide
all
their
food
and
lodging,
would
i
be
able
to
obtain
their...
a
right
to
their
social
security
payments?
justice
scalia
and
why
is
that?
justice
scalia
suppose
i
have
obligations
under
state
law
to
support
my
spouse
and
my
wife
becomes
old
and
unable
to
take
care
of
herself
and
i
fulfill
that
obligation,
provide
her
room,
lodging,
food
and
everything,
am
i
then
entitled
to
get
the
social
security
payment
because
i
have
an
obligation
to
support
her?
