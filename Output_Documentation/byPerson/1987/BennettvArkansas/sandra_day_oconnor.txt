justice
o'connor
mr.
carpenter,
now,
is
there
any
money
at
issue
here
that
would
be
governed
by
the
passage
of
the
1983
amendments?
justice
o'connor
so,
if
you
prevail,
he
will
get
reimbursed
eventually,
is
that
what
would
happen?
justice
o'connor
and
is
petitioner
shelton
a
party
now?
justice
o'connor
so,
he's
not
before
us
at
all,
and
all
we
have
is
the
case
involving
reimbursement
to
a
prisoner
with
social
security
benefits,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
and
since
the
1983
amendments,
you
concede
that
the
state
can't
get
any
recoupment
or
take
any
portion
of
the
benefits?
