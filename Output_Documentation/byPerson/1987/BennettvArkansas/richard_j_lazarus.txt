mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
arkansas
seeks
to
accomplish
here
is
the
very
thing
barred
by
section
207
of
the
social
security
act.
the
attachment
and
seizure
of
social
security
benefits.
the
textual
conflict
in
our
view
is
head-on.
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
either
the
federal
or
the
state
law.
section
207
provides
that
social
security
benefits
shall
not
be
subject
to
attachment
or
other
legal
process,
but
that
is
precisely
what
arkansas
sought
in
its
complaint,
what
was
ordered
by
the
trial
court,
and
what
was
held
to
be
permissible
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
contrary
to
arkansas'
claim,
section
207
contains
no
implied
exemption
for
a
state
that
is
seeking
reimbursement
for
costs
it
incurred
in
providing
for
another
individual's
basic
needs.
this
court's
decision,
we
believe,
in
philpott
v.
essex
county
welfare
board
settled
that
issue.
the
court
concluded
there
that
it
saw
"no
reason
why
a
state
performing
its
statutory
duty
to
take
care
of
the
needy
should
be
in
a
preferred
position
as
compared
to
any
other
creditor.
"
the
court
expressly
or
necessarily
rejected
practically
all
the
limiting
principles
upon
which
respondent
relies
in
this
case.
no
exception
to
section
207
was
found
for
state
creditors,
for
creditors
who
provide
basic
needs,
including
those
obliged
by
state
law
to
do
so,
or
for
creditors
whose
debtors
did
not
need
the
federal
monies
to
meet
their
basic
needs.
no
meaningful
distinction
exists
between
this
case
and
philpott.
the
only
difference
between
the
two
cases
is
that
here
the
state
was
performing
its
statutory
duty
to
take
care
of
the
imprisoned,
rather
than
a
statutory
duty
to
take
care
of
the
financially
needy.
it
is
a
difference
of
no
legal
significance
in
the
context
of
section
207.
there
is
no
more
reason
to
place
the
state
outside
the
scope
of
the
anti-attachment
provision.
indeed,
the
state's
claim
in
philpott
to
a
certain
extent
was
arguably
stronger
than
this
case
because
there,
unlike
here,
the
individual
expressly
agreed
in
advance
to
reimburse
the
state
and
at
the
state's
behest
had
applied
for
social
security
benefits
presumably
to
that
end.
respondent
in
certain
lower
courts
suggests
one
other
possible
ground
for
distinction.
they
argue
that
section
207
does
not
apply
to
claims
against
the
individual's
estate
when
the
claimant
has
legal
custody
of
the
individual.
the
statutory
language,
however,
makes
no
such
distinction.
it
does
not
deprive
one
of
legal
custody
of
its
federal
right
under
section
207
to
control
the
disbursement
of
a
social
security
benefit.
we
do
not
deny
that
certain
equities
favor
the
state's
position
in
this
case.
section
207,
however,
does
not
call
for
or
allow
for
a
balancing
of
the
equities.
to
the
extent
that
any
inequity
exists,
an
application
of
207,
only
congress
can
revisit
the
issue.
in
fact,
congress
has
done
so
to
a
limited
extent,
but
congress
did
not
choose
arkansas'
preferred
solution.
congress
determined
instead
that
to
the
extent
that
an
inequity
is
presented,
when
the
individual
is
in
a
penal
institution,
the
correct
answer
is
that
the
federal
government
and
not
the
states
will
get
the
money.
congress
did
not
lift
the
anti-assignment
bar.
congress,
instead,
concluded
that
incarcerated
felons
should
not
receive
their
social
security
benefits
in
the
first
instance.
finally,
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
rose
v.
rose
does
not
suggest
otherwise.
rose,
unlike
this
case,
involves
a
preemption
challenge
to
state
family
law,
did
not
purport
to
question
at
all
the
court's
decision
in
philpott.
the
court
simply
concluded
that
a
similarly-worded
anti-attachment
provision
regarding
veterans'
disability
benefits
was
not
implicated
by
a
claim
for
child
support
because
congress
had
intended
that
the
children
of
veterans,
too,
should
receive
those
benefits.
there
is
no
comparable
expression
of
congressional
intent
that
state
penal
institutions
should
receive
the
federal
monies.
the
financial
claims
of
the
state
penal
institutions,
therefore,
are
not
comparable
to
the
claims
of
the
children
arose.
arkansas,
therefore,
may
charge
a
prisoner
for
the
cost
of
his
care.
it
may,
of
course,
generally
use
legal
process
against
the
prisoner's
estate
to
recover
those
charges,
but
federal
social
security
benefits
are
simply
out
of
bounds.
they
are
not...
they
are
immune
from
such
legal
process.
congress
could
have
made
an
exception
for
state
institutional
care.
policy
distinctions,
we
agree,
do
exist.
in
other
contexts,
congress
has
chosen
to
make
specific
exceptions
to
the
anti-assignment
provision
for
this
reason.
but
congress
has
not
done
so
here.
in
our
view,
that
is
simply
the
end
of
the
matter.
one
other
final
point.
in
answer
to
a
question
posed
by
justice
o'connor
and
justice
scalia,
with
respect
to
the
over-payment
made
here,
it
is
the
government's
view
that
mr.
bennett
is
currently
entitled
to
money
in
the
bank
account.
after
he
was
released
from
prison
in
december
'84,
hhs
discovered
in
january
'85
that
he
had
wrongly
received
benefits
while
in
prison.
hhs
proceeded
to
recoup
payments
prospectively
for
payments
he
was
then
entitled
to
for
retirement
benefits
up
until,
i
think,
june
of
1986.
at
that
time,
hhs
concluded
that
he
had
paid
back
everything
that
he
had
been
over-paid.
hhs
subsequently
concluded
in
july
of
'86,
about
a
year
later,
in
june
of
'85,
that
he
had
not
yet
paid
back
all
that
he
had
been
over-paid
before.
hhs
notified
mr.
bennett
in
september
of
'86
and
proceeded
to
recoup
again.
in
october
of
'86,
after
receiving
a
protest
and
a
request
for
a
waiver
from
mr.
bennett,
under
section
404(b)
of
the
social
security
act,
a
waiver
of
over-payment,
hhs
decided
to
waive
recoupment
of
the
rest
of
the
over-payment.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
