mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
a
federal
statute
that
precludes
attachment
of
social
security
benefits
bars
a
state's
attempt
to
attach
those
benefits
in
order
to
reimburse
itself
for
providing
care
and
maintaining
a
prisoner
in
custody.
mr.
bennett,
petitioner,
believes
that
pursuant
to
the
supremacy
clause
in
article
vi,
clause
ii
0of
the
constitution,
the
federal
statute
prevails.
to
that
end,
mr.
bennett
urges
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court
to
the
contrary.
the
factual
matter
is
that
mr.
bennett
is
a
sixty-nine-year
old
social
security
pensioner.
he
received
retirement
benefits
because
he
worked
sufficient
quarters
to
be
eligible
for
those
benefits.
he
was
serving
a
term
of
twenty-one
years
in
the
arkansas
department
of
correction
on
a
conviction
in
murder
in
the
second
degree.
while
he
was
in
the
department
of
correction,
he
began
drawing
these
benefits
at
approximately
the
rate
of
$282
per
month.
in
1981,
the
state
of
arkansas
passed
a
state
reimbursement
statute
which
is
act
715.
the
act
became
effective
in
june
of
1981.
in
january
of
1983,
the
state
filed
suit
against
mr.
bennett
and
two
other
petitioners
asking
that
they
be
forced
to
reimburse
the
state
for
their
cost
of
care.
in
april
of
1983,
the
congress
passed
a
statute
that
cut
off
benefits
to
prisoners
entirely.
in
november
of
'83,
there
was
a
consolidated
answer
by
the
parties.
briefs
were
filed
in
1984.
in
december
of
1984,
prior
to
the
case
finally
being
decided
but
after
the
court
had
entered
an
order
seizing
these
funds,
mr.
bennett
was
released
from
incarceration.
a
judgment
came
down
in
1985
and
then
the
judgement
ordered
that
the
monies
continued
to
be
held
pending
outcome
of
any
litigation.
specifically
raised
in
the
trial
court
was
the
question
of
whether
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
federal
exemption
statute
for
social
security
benefits
preempted
the
state
reimbursement
statute.
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
approximately
some
place
between
$10
and
$1800
pre-1983
and
there
is
approximately
an
equal
amount
after
the
1983
statutes.
however,
mr.
bennett's
monies
were
treated
as
an
over-payment
by
the
social
security
department.
those
monies
have
been
returned
to
the
social
security
through
withholding
of
his
future
payments
which
began
again
upon
his
release
in
december
of
1984.
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
yes,
your
honor.
he
will.
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
no,
your
honor.
petitioner
shelton
would
never
complete
an
affidavit
of
indigence
during
the
course
of
litigation.
he
was
released
and
i
lost
all
contact
with
him
afterwards.
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
yes,
your
honor.
that's
the
issue
before
the
court
today.
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
i
am
at
this
time,
your
honor,
for
this
reason:
the
money
collected
from
may
1983
until
his
release
in
december
of
1984
were
social
security
benefits.
he
was
ineligible
for
them,
but
rather
than
treat
them
in
any
other
way,
social
security
treated
it
merely
as
an
over-payment.
when
he
became
eligible
again
for
social
security
payments
in
january
of
1985,
after
his
release,
the
social
security
department
attached
his
future
payments.
so,
all
of
the
monies
being
held
now
really
are
social
security
monies
that
mr.
bennett
should
have
received
personally
at
one
time
or
another.
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
i've
made
myself
clear.
he
continued
to
receive
payments
from
may
'83
to
december
of
'84,
because
social
security
did
not
cut
them
off
like
they
should
have.
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
that
was
treated
as
an
over-payment
from
social
security
to
mr.
bennett.
mr.
bennett
was
eligible
again
for
benefits
when
he
was
released.
social
security
recouped
this
over-payment
from
him
by
deducting
the
money
from
future
payments.
i
do
not
contend
that
the
money
should
go
from
the
prison
to
social
security.
i
contend
upon
release
they
should
go
from
the
prison
to
mr.
bennett
because
they
are
his
monies
now.
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
not
on
the
basis
of
the
statute.
no,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
--he
will
get
$3,600
which
is
currently
being
held,
and
under
the
judgment,
he
will
get
the
interest
that's
been
accruing
on
that
money
since
the
date
of
the
judgment.
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
plus
the
interest.
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
the
supremacy
clause
is
called
into
question
in
this
particular
case
because
there's
a
clear
conflict
in
the
text
of
the
state
reimbursement
statute
with
the
federal
pre-emption
statute.
the
federal
pre-emption
statute
holds
that
the
entitlement
to
payments
at
present
or
in
the
future
are
not
subject
to
levy,
attachment,
garnishment
or
other
legal
process.
yet,
the
state
reimbursement
statute
expressly
defines
the
estate
of
a
prisoner
to
include
social
security
benefits.
now,
when
you
have
a
direct
conflict
between
a
federal
statute
and
a
state
statute,
as
is
present
in
this
case,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
federal
statute
must
fall
under
the
supremacy
clause
argument.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
has
never
recognized
or
has
never
articulated
the
fact
that
there
is
a
direct
conflict
between
the
state
statute
and
the
federal
statute.
instead,
the
arkansas
supreme
court
suggested
that
it
could
ignore
the
plain
textual
conflict
and
move
into
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
purpose
of
the
federal
statute
met
the
purpose
of
the
state
statute.
it's
our
contention,
first,
that
that
was
an
inappropriate
thing
to
do
and
that
the
case
should
have
stopped
at
the
recognition
of
the
clear
conflict
in
the
language.
however,
even
if
we
go
to
the
second
step
and
get
into
the
purpose
of
the
particular
statutes,
it's
clear
that
the
arkansas
supreme
court
did
not
correctly
decide
this
issue.
the
purpose
of
social
security
statutes
is
to
provide
benefits
to
beneficiaries
who
have
qualified
for
them.
in
the
retirement
sense,
it
is
effectively
an
annuity-type
contract.
you
make
forced
payments
from
your
payroll
and
in
exchange,
you
are
guaranteed
payments
at
the
end.
but
congress
recognized
at
the
time
that
it
passed
this
that
it
had
the
right
to
take
these
benefits
away
entirely.
it
could
at
any
moment
with
the
stroke
of
a
pen
say
social
security
is
no
longer
available
to
the
citizens
of
the
united
states,
and
partly
for
that
reason,
as
this
court
recognized
in
hisquierdo,
in
a
different
type
of
benefit
but
same
type
of
statute,
the
vulnerability
of
these
particular
benefits
is
such
that
the
court
is
unwilling
to
let
these
benefits
or
the
congress
is
unwilling
to
let
these
benefits
be
subject
to
attachment
by
any
type
of
creditor.
that's
an
important
point
here
because
it
raises,
i
think,
the
mis-rationale
of
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas.
the
purpose
of
social
security
is
to
provide
for
the
benefit,
the
care
and
benefit
and
maintenance
of
the
individual,
but
the
purpose
of
the
exemption
statute
is
to
assure
that
these
benefits
are
not
subjected
to
creditors,
and
that
purpose
is
in
conflict
with
the
reimbursement
statute
that
the
state
has
passed
because
the
state
is
merely
a
creditor
trying
to
be
repaid
for
providing
care
and
maintenance
to
these
individuals.
the
cost
of
care
is
defined
as
food,
clothing,
medical
care
and
normal
living
expenses.
however,
the
reimbursement
statute
goes
further.
it
permits
costs
of
care
to
include
other
things
because
it
discusses
it
in
terms
of
per
capita
basis
later
on
in
the
statute,
which
can
mean
the
cost
of
providing
guards,
which
is
not
a
social
security
purpose.
it
also
provides
in
the
statute
that
if
there
is
some
sort
of
contempt
citation
involved,
then
the
cost
of
that
can
be
taken
from
these
monies,
which
is
not
a
social
security
purpose.
it
also
provides
that
the
cost
of
investigation
to
find
out
if
the
individual
has
these
funds
in
the
first
place
is
the
type
of
cost
that
can
be
reimbursed,
and
that
is
not
a
social
security
purpose.
the
key
to
the
matter
is
that
neither
on
the
face
of
the
language
or
the
purpose
behind
the
particular
statutes
are
the
arkansas
statutes
and
the
federal
exemption
statutes
reconcilable.
they
are
in
clear
conflict.
now,
the
reason
we
have
our
form
of
government
is
because
we
had
to
recognize
at
some
point
the
federal
government
must
prevail,
and
for
that
reason,
we
have
a
supremacy
clause
in
our
constitution,
and
this
is
a
prime
example
as
to
why
the
statute
in
arkansas
must
fall
to
the
extent
that
it
permits
attachment
of
these
federal
benefits.
we
would
like
to
conclude
with
this
short
note.
if
the
case
is
reversed,
this
is
merely
another
case
in
a
long
line
of
cases
on
supremacy
clause
litigation,
and
at
most
would
be
a
case
note
in
our
constitutional
law
textbooks.
but
if
the
case
is
affirmed,
it
becomes
a
dagger
with
which
to
shred
the
fabric
that
has
protected
the
federal-state
relationship
since
our
country
was
founded
200
years
ago,
and
then
it
becomes
a
chapter
in
our
common
law
textbooks
and
a
very
dangerous
step
towards
ruining
federalism.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
any
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
m.
carpenter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
know
how
general
clark
can
say
he
imposes
no
hardship.
george
bennett
is
a
sixty-nine
year
old
man
that
can't
get
a
job
and
had
to
leave
the
department
of
corrections
without
the
$1800
which
would
have
been
a
great
benefit
to
him
in
providing
for
his
care
and
maintenance
when
he
left,
and
had
he
not
had
family
members
to
go
and
live
with
at
that
particular
time,
he
would
have
been
destitute.
so,
i
think
it
does
pose
a
hardship.
the
fact
that
the
state
of
arkansas
doesn't
at
this
time
seem
to
attach
social
security
and
has
some
memorandum
out
is
no
future
guarantee
that
it's
not
going
to
make
the
effort
again,
and
it's
important
for
this
court
to
rule
that
that
effort
cannot
be
made.
the
respondent
is
suggesting
essentially
that
there
should
be
a
new
type
of
exemption
under
42
usc
407
or
section
207
of
the
code
and
this
is
for
those
that
are
constitutionally
mandated
to
provide
for
care,
yet
the
congress
has
never
said
that
those
that
are
constitutionally
mandated
to
provide
care
to
individuals
are
exempt
from
our
attachment
statutes,
and
congress
certainly
has
the
ability
to
do
that.
when
congress
posed
the
question,
for
example,
in
other
types
of
retirement
benefits
as
to
whether
people
that
committed
certain
types
of
crimes,
mostly
treason-type
crimes,
are
entitled
to
these
benefits
anyway,
congress
very
quickly
said
no.
when
congress
was
given
opportunities
to
deal
with
different
situations,
they
set
up
guidelines.
when
congress
needed
to
figure
out
a
way
to
set
up
alternate
payees,
it
did
so
and
then
it
directed
the
secretary
through
the
regulations
to
do
so
and
the
secretary
did
that.
everything
we've
heard
from
the
state
is
essentially
a
policy
argument.
the
state
is
trying
to
say
our
policy
meets
your
policy
and,
therefore,
it's
a
good
policy.
but
the
relative
importance
of
a
state's
own
suggestion
or
own
law
is
not
material
and
this
court
has
so
held
when
it
conflicts
with
a
federal
law.
the
court
said
that
first
in
1962
in
free
v.
bland
and
it
has
reiterated
that
several
times,
most
recently
in
hisquierdo.
we
would
note
and
i
would
like
to
paraphrase
it,
if
i
may,
a
very
apt
statement
from
the
louisiana
public
service
commission
v.
federal
communications
commission,
and
this
is
a
paraphrase.
a
state
may
not
confer
power
upon
itself.
to
permit
a
state
to
expand
its
power
in
the
face
of
congressional
limitation
would
be
to
grant
to
the
states
the
power
to
override
the
congress.
this,
the
court
should
be
unwilling
to
do.
rose
v.
rose
dealt
with
family
law
situations
and
followed
a
long
line
of
cases
that
had
looked
closely
to
the
family
law
situation.
the
arkansas
department
of
corrections
can
in
no
way
be
equated
with
george
bennett's
family,
particularly
when
it
left
him
at
the
door
with
a
departure
allowance
and
said
go
home,
we're
going
to
hold
your
money.
the
arkansas
legislature
also
passed
an
act
and
entitled
it
to
take
monies
from
the
families
of
policemen
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
because
it
met
with
a
good
state
purpose
and
worker's
comp,
and
this
court
summarily
reversed
in
rose
v.
arkansas
state
police.
we
ask
the
court
to
follow
that
rule
and
reverse
and
let
it
be
known
that
the
exemption
statute
means
these
funds
cannot
be
attached
and
states
cannot
declare
that
there
is
a
purpose
that
meets
the
congressional
purpose.
only
the
congress
can
decide
that.
thank
you.
