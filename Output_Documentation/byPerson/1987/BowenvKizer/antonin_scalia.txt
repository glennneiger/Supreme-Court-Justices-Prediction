justice

or
at
least
this
congress'
interpretation
of
the
original
moratorium,
which
is
really
not
which
governs
what
the
original
moratorium
meant.
justice
scalia
but
that
is
not
the
question
that
is
up
for
determination.
the
question
that
is
up
for
determination
was
whether
a
family
of
three
is
the
same
size
as
a
family
for
two?
it
was
not
left
up
to
the
state
to
decide
how
much
money
to
provide
reasonably,
and
the
federal
government
will
subsidize
all
of
it.
was
the
question
before
the
state
not
whether
a
family
of
two
was,
can
be,
interpreted
to
be
the
same
size
as
a
family
of
three,
or
vice-versa?
which
come
to
the
same
thing.
justice
scalia
no.
the
state,
when
it
was
interpreting
the
rom,
or
the
rom
when
it
was
interpreting
the
regulation--
justice
scalia
--the
issue
to
be
decided
in
that
interpretation
is
not
"what
is
a
reasonable
amount
to
give
to
a
family
of
three
as
opposed
to
a
family
of
two.
"
but
the
issue
is
"what
does
"same
size"
mean?
"
justice
scalia
you
are
saying
it
is
a
reasonable
interpretation?
justice
scalia
well,
and
it
specifically
provided
for
reinstatement
of
that
policy.
did
that
house
bill
not
contain
a
specific
provision
that
reinstated
that
policy
in
so
many
words?
justice
scalia
so,
and
that
was
rejected:
the
conferees
did
not
adopt
that.
justice
scalia
so
the
language
in
the
house
history
proves
nothing
except
that
the
house
proposed
an
amendment
to
(f)
which
was
not
adopted.
it
does
not
necessarily
prove
anything
beyond
that.
justice
scalia
you
can
win
on
that,
but
you
cannot
use
to
support
that
argument
the
legislative
history
that
you
are
trying
to
use
in
the
house
which
showed
that
what
the
house
thought
of
the
interpretation
was
wrong.
that
is
the
only
disadvantage
of
going
that
way.
they
thought
it
was
right
and
you
want
to
change
it.
