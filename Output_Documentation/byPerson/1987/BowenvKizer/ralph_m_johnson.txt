mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
based
on
two
separate
and
independent
determinations.
it
is
that
second
determination
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
you.
that
is
the
moratorium,
because
in
our
view,
the
moratorium
should
be
the
dispositive
issue
in
this
case.
in
june
1984,
congress
enacted
the
deficit
reduction
act,
defra.
and
section
2373(c)
of
that
act
provides
the
18-month
moratorium
that
the
solicitor-general
was
just
discussing
with
you
in
his
opening
argument.
we
believe
that
congress
meant
in
enacting
that
moratorium
to
authorize
on
a
time-limited
basis,
states'
use
of
medically-needy
income
levels
for
adult
couples
set
at
133.33
percent
of
the
afdc
grant
for
three.
and
we
believe
that
is
so
for
two
reasons:
first,
the
issue
that
was
before
congress
as
it
enacted
the
defra
moratorium,
was
the
reversal
by
hhf...
hhs,
of
its
policy
embodied
in
rom-2572.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
i
do
not
think
we
are
at
difference
with
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
the
principal
holding
i
think
that
you
are
referring
to,
justice
rehnquist,
was
the
ninth
circuit
giving
legal
force
and
effect
to
the
rom
in
the
same
status
as
one
would
in
a
duly-promulgated
regulation
and/or
statute.
yes,
we
are
taking
a
different
view,
as
we
indicated
in
our
briefs.
we
have
not
taken
that
position
in
defending
that
determination
in
this
court.
our
view
is
that
rom-2572,
as
our
view
was,
incidently,
before
the
ninth
circuit,
and
before
the
secretary
in
the
administrative
process,
that
this
rom
was
an
interpretive
guideline.
however,
in
the
medicaid
program
that...
it
is
a
joint
federal
and
state
program,
and
that
under
section
201.3,
particularly
subsection
d,
the
secretary's
own
regulation
provides
that
when
state
plans
are
evaluated
or
approved
by
the
secretary
or
whomever
she
has
delegated...
or
he,
has
delegated
to
that
task,
that
guidelines
are
referred
to
in
determining
what
the
regulations
that
the
secretary
has
promulgated,
really
mean.
so
that
when
we
look
at
the
regulation
that
exist
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
cap
on
the
federal
financial
participation,
it
is
indeed
under
the
secretary's
regulations
for
purposes
of
approving
state
plans
altogether
appropriate
to
look
at
what
their
policy
interpretation
has
been
of
what
that
regulation
means.
and
that
is
what
rom-2572
was
and
that
is
what
it
is.
it
interprets
the
secretary's
own
regulation
to
say
that
in
the
case
of
adult
couples,
you
could
have
a
medically-needy
income
level
set
at
an
afdc
level
of
three.
and
the
reason
that
that
rom
determined
that
that
was
appropriate
was
that
one
could
determine
that
in
the
case
of
two
adults,
particularly
elderly
adults,
it
simply
costs
more
for
them
to
live.
that
is
what
a
maintenance
need
income
level
really
is.
and
you
could
reasonably
determine,
and
the
state
has
the
flexibility
to
reasonably
determine
that
it
costs
an
elderly
couple
more
to
live
per
month
than
it
does
for
a
parent
and
one
child.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
you
mean
before
the
ninth
circuit,
justice
scalia?
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
yes
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
yes,
that
is
true.
but
i
think
that
it
is
another
way
of
saying
the
same
thing,
mr.
justice.
that,
as...
bear
in
mind
that
the
rom
was
a
policy
interpretation
that
came
from
hhs.
this
is
not
a
state
interpretation,
sir.
that
is
a
federal
interpretation.
it
is
a
federal
interpretation
of
a
federal
regulation.
we
simply,
rather
than
trying
to
exploit
it,
we
tried
to
rely
on
it.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
yes
it
is,
we
felt
so.
indeed,
we
think
congress
specifically
reaffirmed
that
regulation,
or
that
policy
interpretation,
when
it
adopted
the
defra
moratorium,
because
the
issue
that
was
before
the
conference
committee
was
made
clear
in
the
conference
committee
report,
and
in...
before
we
refer
to
that
report
we
have
to
have...
in
april
1983,
hhs
had
promulgated
a
policy
letter
to
all
regions,
and
that
is
at
appendix
b
to
our
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition.
in
that
letter,
for
the
first
time,
hhs
takes
the
view
that,
in
light
of
congress'
enactment
of
tefra
and
the
tefra,
that
states
could
no
longer
set
adult
couple
income
levels
at
133.33
percent
of
the
grant
for
three,
as
provided
in
rom-2572,
and
that
letter
specifically
states
rom-2572
because
of
the
enactment
of
tefra
and
the
tefra.
that
1902(a)(10)(c)(i)(3).
that
is
the
same
section
that
is
referred
to
in
the
defra
moratorium.
and
then
when
you
refer
to
the
conference
committee
report
to
determine
what
was
the
issue,
what
was
the
problem
that
they
thought
they
were
addressing
in
adopting
the
moratorium,
the
language
that
the
conference
committee
used
is
almost
identical
in
addressing...
in
articulating,
the
issue
that
is
addressed
in
that
1983
all-regions
letter.
when
the
conference
committee
says,
"similarly,
the
department
has
taken
the
position.
"
it
is
exactly
that
letter
that
was
sent
out
to
all
of
the
policy
regions
some
few
months
before
that
congress
was
referring
to
and
that
conference
committee
report
reiterates
what
the
secretary's
position
was
as
it
was
stated,
or
i
should
say,
the
department's
position,
as
it
was
stated
in
that
all-regions
policy
letter,
that
in
light
of
congress'
enactment
of
the
tefra,
states
could
no
longer
set
maintenance
need
income
levels
for
adult
couples
because
that
would
result
in
a
different
medically
needy
income
level
among
groups
of
the
same
family
size,
depending
upon
the
relative
numbers
of
adults
and
childrens.
so
it
is
almost
the
same
language
that
was
used
by
the
department
in
their
all-regions
policy
letter
in
april
1983.
congress
then
criticizes
the
secretary's
overly-restrictive
interpretation
of
the
tefra
amendment
and
prohibited
denying
the
state
plan
amendments...
state
plans,
and
more
recently,
state
plan
amendments,
making
it
clear
based
on
that
overly-restrictive
reading.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
they
intended,
mr.
justice,
we
believe,
by
that
very
language
referring
right
to
the
secretary's
ruling
of
rom...
or
reversing
rom-2572,
to
reaffirm
the
department's
policy
set
out
in
rom-2572.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
there
were
two
states,
justice
white,
at
that
point
in
time,
who
were
proposing
to
utilize
the
criteria
of
rom-2572:
ourselves
and
nebraska.
now,
if
there
is
any
ambiguity...
i
am
sorry?
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
we
would
have
to
make
it
as
an
assumption,
mr.
justice,
because
i
could
say
that
the
legislative
history
does
not
specifically
say
they
were
aware
that
california
and
that
nebraska
was.
i
can
say,
however,
that
it
is
almost
certain
from
the
legislative
history,
because
the
letter,
the
all-regions
policy
letter,
that
was
sent
out
in
april
1983,
which
indeed
there
is
no
question
that
that
is
what
they
were
referring
to,
is
in
fact
in
response
to
an
inquiry
concerning
california's
state
plan
amendment
and
that
inquiry--
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
--that
is
right.
the
policy
letter
itself
is
referring
back
to
california's
state
plan
amendment,
because
the
inquiry
had
come
in
from
the
region
nine
san
francisco
office.
but
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
the
conference...
the
conferees'
report
itself,
that
ambiguity
it
seems
to
me,
is
completely
resolved
when
you
refer
over
to
the
house
report
in
support
of
the
house
bill
that
came
in
to
conference.
because
the
house
report
in
support
of
that
bill
specifically
says,
"hhs
has
reversed
itself
on
the
policy
that
it
had
contained
in
2572.
"
it
severely
criticized
hhs
for
making
that
policy
reversal;
it
made
clear
that
it
is
entirely
logical
that
the
state
could
determine
that
it
could
cost
an
elderly
couple
more
to
live
per
month
than
it
would
a
single...
a
parent
and
one
child;
and
it
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
house
bill
was,
indeed,
to
reinstate
that
policy.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
mr.
justice,
what
the
house
bill
proposed,
the
remedy
that
it
proposed,
was
to
amend
section
1903(f).
the
conferees--
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
--the
conferees
did
not
amend
1903(f).
indeed,
the
moratorium--
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
--with
respect,
mr.
justice,
i
would
disagree,
because
i
think
it
is
very
important
and
entirely
appropriate
to
refer
to
when
you
are
looking
to
see
what
was
the
issue
that
was
before
the
conference
committee.
because
the
senate
bill
had
no
provisions
in
it
concerning
adult
couple
income
levels.
that
issue
was
framed
by
the
house
bill.
and
since
that
issue
was
framed
by
the
house
bill,
it
seems
that
it
is
entirely
appropriate
to
look
at
what
the
house
report
was
as
to
what
that
issue
was.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
bear
in
mind
that
the
moratorium
amends
no
statute:
provides
no
permanent
solutions;
what
it
does--
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
--absolutely.
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
no,
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
is
the
other
way
around.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
i
think
that
in
reaffirming
the
policy
set
out
in
rom,
they
were
determining
that
the
secretary,
or
i
should
say
hhs,
had
made
a
proper
policy
interpretation
under
1903(f),
and
that
that
policy
should
be
reinstated:
1903(f)
says
that
"the
secretary
will
prescribe
standards
for...
prescribe
the
standards
that
are
equivalent
to
133.33
percent.
"
it
is
not
a
flat...
it
gives
the
secretary
a
great
deal
of
discretion
in
determining
what
is
equivalent
and
in
the
manner
in
prescribing
what
those
standards
are.
we
think
that
that
policy
interpretation
was
entirely
proper.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
if
in
fact
the
report
was
filed
in
september,
it
would
end
18
months
after.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
the
moratorium
required
hhs,
or
the
secretary,
to
file
a
report
with
congress
in
which
it
would
discuss
the
entire
broad
range
of
medicaid
eligibility--
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
--but
for
the
fact
that
congress
has
in
fact
said
it
will
end,
mr.
justice,
i
think
you
would
be
absolutely
right.
once
you...
the
whole
purpose
behind
tefra,
when
they
enacted
that
in
1982,
was
to
re-establish
all
the
medicaid
eligibility
rules
that
existed
prior
to
1981,
when
the
omnibus
budget
reconciliation
act
was
enacted.
had
not
congress
decided
in
the
moratorium
to
only
have
those
more-flexible
rules
that
applied
before
obra,
in
effect
for
18
months...
indeed
they
would
have...
that
would
have
continued
to
be
extant
law
in
light
of
tefra.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
in
enacting
the
moratorium
by
virtue
of
having...
well,
i
think
what
the
congress
is
doing...
as
it
said
in
the
conference
committee
report,
that
they
wanted
these
more
flexible
rules
re-established
as
they
existed
prior
to
1981,
and
they
were
going
to
be
studying
the
matter
further
during
that
period
of
18
months.
i
think
that
congress
was
well
within
its
powers
of
putting
on
that
18-month
limitation,
but
by
virtue
of
saying
that,
"we
are
at
the
end
of
18
months,
either
we
are
going
to
legislate
further.
"
that
in
fact
they
did
not
mean
to
re-establish
the
medicaid
eligibility
policies
that
existed
prior
to
obra
would
require
us
to
disregard
what
they
had
said
when
they
enacted
tefra.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
mr.
justice,
i
think
what
congress
is
really
telling
us
in
the
moratorium--
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
--they
are
saying
that.
but
i
do
not
know
that
they
are
saying
they
can
construe
it
either
way.
i
think
they
are
saying
they
want
a
report
from
the
secretary.
but
when
you
look
at
the
conference
committee
report
and
when
you
look
at
the
house
report
in
support
of
the
recent
clarification
of
the
moratorium,
it
becomes
clear,
and
in
fact
the
house
even
says
that
"the
legislative
history
of
this
moratorium.
"
and
grant
you
it
is
a
subject
even
broader
than
adult
couple
income
levels,
"the
legislative
history
of
this
moratorium
dates
back
to
the
enactment
by
congress
of
obra
in
1981.
"
because
it
was
after
that
statute
that
on
its
face
purported
to
give
states
greater
flexibility
in
its
medicaid
eligibility
rules,
that
the
department
has
been
misinterpreting
what
congress'
intents
were
in
enacting
first
obra
and,
as
a
result
of
the
secretary's
proposed
regulations
to
implement
obra,
as
this
court
recognized
last
term
in
adkins
v.
rivera,
that
interpretation
was
immediately
rejected
and
that
led
to
the
single-standard
requirement
in
tefra.
i
think
that
defra
is
further
indication...
as
it
says...
is
the
secretary's
misinterpretation
of
the
requirements
under
tefra.
so,
justice
white,
when
we
say
that
they
have
now...
this
moratorium
must
be
viewed
in
light
of
that
history.
and
i
think
what
congress
is
saying
is
that,
"for
the
next
18
months,
mr.
secretary,
get
it
right.
"
"and
we
are
going
to
make
sure
you
get
it
right
because
we
are
going
to
have
this
moratorium
clearly
and
specifically
having
all
the
pre-obra
eligibility
standards
in
effect,
and
at
the
end
of
that
18
months,
we
may
very
well
change
our
minds
and
rewrite
it
all,
but
for
the
next
18
months
we
want
to
make
sure
you
get
it
right.
"
and
in
our
view,
this
concerns
the
income...
the
adult
couple
income
level.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
mr.
justice,
this
does
not
amend
any
statute.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
the
effect
that
it
is
intended
to
have,
as
congress
said
when
it
enacted
tefra,
and
what
is
essentially
be
reiterated
here,
is
to
re-establish
the
eligibility
rules
that
existed
prior
to
obra.
and
that
is
the
purpose
they
had
wanted
to
be
accomplishing
when
they
enacted
tefra
and
again
when
they
were
enacting
defra.
these
are
the
issues,
the
subject
of
the
moratorium
are
not
just
income
levels
for
adult
couples--
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
--yes,
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
at
odds
with
what
our
position
is,
mr.
justice.
i
am
just
saying
that
the
fact--
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
--well,
it
is
additional
legislative
history,
mr.
justice,
but
it
seems
it
would
be
appropriate
when
you
have
no
provision
coming
from
the
senate
on
this
adult
couple
income
levels,
and
that
issue
was
framed
by
a
bill
that
comes
from
house
and
from
conference
committee.
we
think
the
conference
committee's
statements
itself
are
abundantly
clear
as
to
what
it
wanted
done.
but
it
seems,
it
is
given
additional
clarity
by
reference
over
to
the
house
report,
because
the
house
report
only
dealt
with
this
one
specific
issue
and
was
longer
and
more
explanatory.
but
we
think
standing
on
its
own
the
conference
committee
report
itself
makes
clear
that
they
wanted...
they
were
reversing
the
department's
reversal
of
its
policy
set
out
in
rom-2572.
now,
the
second
reason
that
we
think
that
the
moratorium
authorizes
california
to
set
its
income
levels
at
133.33
percent
of
the
grant
for
three
is
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
would
require
not
only
disregarding
the
intent
of
the
conference
committee
as
it
is
set
out
in
the
conference
committee
report
issue
now...
yes,
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
it
would
not
only
require
the
court,
then,
to
disregard
what
we
think
is
the
very
clear
intent
of
the
conference
committee
as
set
out
in
their
report,
but
would
also
require
you
to
disregard
congressional
rejection
of
just
the
interpretation
that
they
are
urging
upon
you.
because
it
is
the
secretary's
view
that
all
of
the
moratorium,
as
concerns
adult
couple
income
levels
authorizes,
is
the
setting
of
an
adult
couple
income
level
at
133.33
percent
of
the
grant...
the
afdc
grant,
for
two.
all
other
income
levels
would
be
set
below
that.
it
is
just
that
interpretation
and
giving
states
that
kind
of
flexibility
that
congress
specifically
rejected
in
tefra.
in
september
1981,
in
reaction
to
the
adoption
of
obra,
the
secretary
promulgated...
hhs
promulgated,
proposed
regulations
that
would
have
authorized
states,
given
states,
the
flexibility
of
setting
a
separate
income
level
for
each
medically
needy
group.
those
that
were
ssi
related,
the
aged,
blind
and
disabled,
could
be
set
in
relation
to
the
ssi
cash
grants.
those
that
were
afdc
length,
could
have
been
set
at
the
afdc
level,
because
afdc
cash
grants
are
traditionally
lower
than
an
ssi
grant,
the
income
level
that
could
have
resulted
under
that
proposed
regulation
would
have
been
for
an
afdc-linked
family
to
have
a
lower
medically-needy
income
level
than
the
ssi-linked
groups.
that
is
specifically
what
congress
rejected.
and
it
says
specifically
so
in
the
house
report
on
tefra
when
it
enacted
the
single-standard
requirement.
it
is
that
interpretation
that
led
to
the
enactment
of
the
single-standard
requirement
of
tefra.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
is
what
it
had
been
to
accomplish
by
this
moratorium,
and
congress,
would
have
said,
"we
are
now
reversing
our
own
selves
of
what
we
had
said
just
less
than
two
years
before
when
we
enacted
tefra.
"
to
the
contrary,
congress
is
saying
in
its
enacting
the
moratorium,
"states
are
to
be
given
the
flexibility
of
using
less
restrictive
eligibility
criteria,
and
in
the
case
of
adult
couple
income
levels,
to
set
that
medically-needy
income
level
at
133.33
percent
of
the
afdc
grant
for
three.
"
because
that
is
what
was
authorized
in
rom-2572
and
we
believe
they
reaffirmed
that
policy
in
the
moratorium.
had
they
meant
to
reject
their
own
determination
in
tefra,
they
certainly
would
have
said
so,
particularly
in
a
moratorium,
which
i
think
we
can
all
agree,
is
at
least
abundantly
clear
in
the
fact
that
it
wants
to
give
the
states
greater
and
more
flexibility
to
use
less
restrictive...
which
means
higher...
income
standards.
we
think,
in
conclusion,
that
looking
at
the
issue
that
was
before
the
conference
committee,
that
issue
was
hhs's
rejection...
or
reversal,
of
its
own
policy
set
out
in
rom-2572,
and
in
looking
at
the
ramifications
of
what
the
secretary's
position
is,
that
we
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
congress
meant
to
provide
first
the
reaffirmation
of
rom-2572:
states
can
use
133.33
percent
of
the
afdc
grant
for
three,
and
certainly
the
secretary's
interpretation
would
be
unreasonable
in
light
of
congress'
rejection
of
just
that
interpretation
when
it
enacted
defra.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
the
case
would
be
extremely
different,
mr.
justice.
very,
very
different.
without
a
moratorium,
the
only
issue,
then,
would
be
what
effect,
if
any,
would
you
bring
to--
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
--it
could
have
been
articulated,
"why
that
even
given
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
that
we
have,
the
only
issue
left
in
the
case
would
then
be,
'what
deference
one
should
pay
to
the
rom
independent
of
the
moratorium?
"
that
is
why
i
said
at
the
outset,
i
believe
the
moratorium
is
really
the
dispositive
issue
of
the
case,
because
we
believe
that
the
moratorium
specifically
meant
to
authorize
to
give
states
that
flexibility.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
with
all
respect,
i
would
rather
say
that
it
was
a
tough
case.
mr.
ralph
m.
johnson
they
have
the
law
different
than
what
the
secretary
was
interpreting
it
as,
yes
sir.
they
want
the
law
back
to
the
way
the
secretary
had
interpreted
it
prior
to
congress'
enactment
of
obra.
yes,
sir,
that
is
our
position.
