justice
white
did
the
secretary
ever
direct
any...
anyone
to
use
it?
justice
white
mr.
johnson,
what
did
they
intend
the
states
to
be
able
to
do?
justice
white
were
there
some
actual
states
that
were
involved?
justice
white
well,
did
congress
know
that?
that
there
were
two
states
doing
it?
justice
white
somebody
must
have
gotten
to
the
conference
committee
or
to
congress.
justice
white
so
instead
of
amending,
they
did
the
moratorium?
justice
white
well,
do
you...
is
the
inference
not,
though,
that
the
conference
committee...
thought
that
the
statute,
that
the
secretary
was
properly
construing
the
statute?
justice
white
well,
in
revoking
rom,
the
secretary
was
properly
construing
the
statute?
justice
white
you
do?
justice
white
when
would
the
moratorium
end?
justice
white
what
report?
justice
white
if
the
conference
committee
thought
the
secretary
was
properly
construing
the
statute,
under...
when
he
had
the
issue
drawn...
and
not
properly
construing
it
when
he
had
revoked
it,
why
would
the
moratorium
ever
end?
justice
white
it
sounds
like
congress
was
saying,
"we
want
to
get
a
report
from
the
secretary.
"
and
it
sounds
like
they
are
indicating
that
the
statute,
the
secretary
could
construe
the
statute
either
way.
justice
white
at
least
they
are
saying
that.
justice
white
do
you
think
this
was
really
an
18...
it
was
an
amendment
of
the
statute
that
would
last
for
18
months?
justice
white
i
do
not
know,
but
it
has
that
effect.
justice
white
suppose
it
were
perfectly
clear
that
the
secretary's
construction
when
he
revoked
rom,
that
his
construction
of
what
tefra
you
recall
him
saying...
his
construction
of
what
tefra...
was
exactly
right.
and
there
was
a
big
flap...
arose
about
it,
and
so
the
house
said,
"let
us
amend
that
silly
law.
"
and...
but
the
conference
committee
said,
"no,
let
us
just
have
a
moratorium
on
the
secretary
applying
that
law.
"
you
could
still
win
on
that
basis,
could
you
not?
justice
white
now,
before
you...
i
take
it...
well,
you
go
ahead,
you
go
ahead.
justice
white
would
you
be
here
if
there
had
not
been
a...
i
suppose
you
would
still
be
here...
if
there
had
not
been
a
deficit
act
at
all?
if
there
had
not
been
a
moratorium?
justice
white
whether
the
secretary
was
correctly
construing
the
statute?
justice
white
well,
if
you
think
you
have
a
tough
case
absent
the
moratorium,
you
mean
that
you
probably
would
lose
your
case
if
you
were
just
attacking
the
secretary's
construction
of
the
law.
justice
white
well,
in
any
event
then,
to
rely
on
the
deficit
act,
you
really
think
that
congress
meant
to,
for
18
months,
have
the
law
be
different.
justice
white
did
it
send
that
letter?
justice
white
saying
that?
