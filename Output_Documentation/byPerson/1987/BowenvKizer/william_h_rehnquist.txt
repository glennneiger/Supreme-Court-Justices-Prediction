rehnquist
mr.
merrill,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
again,
mr.
merrill.
whatever
time
you
have
left
will
be
reserved.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
johnson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
johnson,
let
me
ask
you
just
a
minute:
you
are
taking
a
somewhat
different
position
than
the
ninth
circuit
took,
because
it
seemed
to
rest
most
of
its
opinion
on
the
rom?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
is
a
matter
of
emphasis,
i
realize,
but
yes
i
thought
they
devoted
most
of
their
opinion
on
the
rom.
i
gather
that
they
thought
that
that
was
the
best
part
of
your
argument.
now
in
effect
you
are
saying
you
think
that
the
defra
point,
i
presume,
is
superior
to
the
rom?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
took
justice
white's
question
to
suggest
that
if
congress
had
really
agreed
with
rom
it
would
not
have
said
"you
cannot
do
anything
for
eight
months,
or
18
months.
"
it
would
have
said,
"you
cannot
ever
do
anything".
which
is
what
the
house
proposed.
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
johnson.
mr.
merrill,
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
merrill.
the
case
is
submitted.
