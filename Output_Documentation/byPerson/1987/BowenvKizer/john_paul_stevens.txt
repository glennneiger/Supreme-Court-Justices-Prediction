justice
stevens
may
i
ask
about
that
act?
that
actually
adopted
after
we
took
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
was
it
not?
justice
stevens
is
that
an
appropriate...
can
congress
enact
a
statute
that
tells
us
how
to
decide
a
case?
justice
stevens
what
other
is...
no
other
state
does
this,
does
it,
or
does
nebraska
do
it,
too?
justice
stevens
but
as
to
the
first
of
the
two
pieces
of
legislation
you
mentioned
in
substance
said
that
the
moratorium
was
intended
to
be
broader
than
its
language
would
indicate?
justice
stevens
how
does
that...
i
am
not
quite
sure
how
that
enters
the
case.
i
found
it
a
little
hard
to
follow
the
moratorium
all
the
way
to
the
end.
justice
stevens
no,
but
at
least
it
establishes
the
proposition
that
the
moratorium
in
the
1984
defra
statute
is
broader
than
the
one
applicable
just
to
1902(a).
justice
stevens
if
you
just
knew
that
much,
you
might
think,
"well,
maybe
it
also
should
apply
to
1903(f)?
"
but
your
point
is
that
they
broadened
it
with
three
specifics
without
adding
the
fourth?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
moratorium?
i
may
have
my
notes
mixed
up,
but
as
i
understood
it,
it
lasted
only
until
something
like
january
1986,
or
whatever
the
date,
but
a
date
that
has
already
passed.
justice
stevens
oh.
justice
stevens
so
it
is
still
in
effect,
whatever
it
is,
all
right.
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
justice
stevens
would
you
agree
that,
if
rom-whatever
the
number
there
is,
were
a
correct
statement
of
the
law,
and
i
know
you
disagree,
that
it
would
be
permissible
to
treat
an
adult
and
two
children
as
equal
to
two
adults?
or
vice-versa,
i
should
say,
that
two
adults
is
equal
to...
the
language
"between"
is
what
you
argued
about
before.
i
do
not
think
you
are
still
arguing
that,
are
you?
justice
stevens
everybody
else
seems
to
have
rejected
that
argument.
i
do
not
understand
you
to
still
be
pursuing
it.
that
is
all
i
want
to
check
on.
justice
stevens
let
me
interrupt
you
once
more,
mr.
merrill.
it
is
just
kind
of
hard
to
get
all...
to
digest
it
all.
but
just
confining
ourselves
for
a
moment,
to
plain
language
of
the
moratorium
section:
does
not
that
issue
turn
on
the
reason
why
the
secretary
rejected
the
rom?
and
you
are
saying
the
reason
was
that
it
did
not
comply
with
1903...
the
reason
was
not
that
it
did
not
comply
with
1902?
justice
stevens
(10)(c)(i)(3).
yes.
but
if,
in
fact,
the
secretary
thought
it
violated
both
the
provisions,
and
i
would
suppose
that
the
secretary
did
think
it
violated
both
provisions,
then
does
not
the
language
of
the
moratorium,
at
least
arguably,
read
on
that?
justice
stevens
would
not
the
government's
position
today
be
that
it
violated
the
(a)(10)(c)(i)(3)?
