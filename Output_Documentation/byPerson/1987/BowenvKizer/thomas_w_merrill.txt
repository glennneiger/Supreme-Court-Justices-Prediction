mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
a
decision
in
the
health
care
financing
administration,
a
unit
in
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
disapproving
a
proposed
amendment
to
california's
state
medicaid
plan.
the
question
is
ultimately
one
of
statutory
construction:
did
the
administrator
properly
conclude
that
the
california
amendment
violates
the
plain
and
unequivocal
language
of
section
1903(f)
of
the
medicaid
act,
or
is
there
some
escape
route
from
this
conclusion,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
and
as
the
respondents
maintain?
section
1903(f)
provides
that
when
a
state
elects
to
participate
in
a
medicaid
program,
the
federal
government
will
reimburse
the
state
only
for
families
whose
income
after
medical
expenses
falls
below
a
certain
cap.
section
1903(f)
sets
that
cap
at
4/3rds
the
highest
amount
ordinarily
paid
by
the
state
under
the
afdc
program
to
a
family
of
the
same
size
having
no
income
or
resources.
in
other
words,
if
the
highest
amount
ordinarily
paid
to
an
afdc
family
of
two,
without
any
income
and
resources
is
$300
a
month,
then
the
cap
on
federal
financial
participation
for
a
family
of
two
would
be
$400
a
month.
in
september
1983
california
submitted
an
amendment
to
its
medicaid
plan
to
the
administrator
of
the
health
care
financing
administration.
the
amendment
provided
that
for
adult
couples
and
only
for
adult
couples,
that
the
medically
needy
income
level
would
be
4/3rds
the
highest
amount
ordinarily
paid
to
an
afdc
family
of
three.
in
its
application,
which
we
have
reproduced
at
page
24
of
the
joint
appendix,
california
admitted
that
the
new
standard
for
adult
couples
exceeded
the
federal
cap
by
$142
a
month.
the
state
also
indicated
by
crossing
out
a
notation
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
that
it
did
not
have
a
method
of
excluding
these
excess
payments
from
future
requests
for
federal
reimbursement.
the
administrator
promptly
rejected
the
proposed
amendment
as
violating
both
section
1903(f)
and
the
secretary's
implementing
regulations.
this,
we
submit,
was
clearly
correct:
section
1903(f)
imposes
a
limit
on
financial
participation
based
on
a
fixed
numerical
relationship
on
a
level
of
benefits
ordinarily
paid
to
an
afdc
family
of
the
same
size.
the
secretary's
regulations
expressly
provide
that
this
limit
applies
to
couples.
california,
however,
proposed
to
set
its
medically
needy
income
level
for
couples
based
on
the
amount
paid
to
a
family
of
three.
an
adult
couple
is
a
family
of
two;
a
family
of
two
is
not
the
same
size
as
a
family
of
three.
thus,
the
california
amendment,
as
the
administrator
properly
found,
violated
the
plain
terms
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations.
the
fact
that
the
statute
gives
the
secretary
authority
to
prescribe
standards
does
not
change
this
conclusion.
the
secretary
is
empowered
only
to
set
standards
for
determining
the
amount
of
benefits
ordinarily
paid
to
a
family
of
a
given
size.
he
is
not
empowered
to
set
standards
for
determining
what
"same
size"
means.
in
any
event,
the
secretary
has
exercised
the
delegated
authority
given
by
section
1903(f).
the
secretary's
regulations,
which
remained
unchanged
in
this
respect
since
1971,
state
that
the
cap
on
federal
financial
participation
is
to
be
determined
for
any
given
family,
including
adult
couples,
by
looking
to
the
amount
ordinarily
received
by
an
afdc
family
of
the
same
size.
thus,
if
there
were
any
doubt
about
the
meaning
of
the
statute
created
by
the
delegation
to
set
standards
to
the
secretary,
it
is
in
judge
kozinski's
phrase,
"neatly
excised
by
the
regulations".
three
arguments
have
been
advanced
in
this
case
in
an
effort
to
defeat
the
plain
import
of
this
statute
and
the
regulations.
first
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
california
amendment
was
authorized
by
a
provision
contained
in
a
1979
internal
agency
manual.
and
that
this
manual
was
a
legislative
regulation
binding
on
the
agency.
second,
the
respondents
maintain
that,
even
if
the
manual
was
not
a
legislative
regulation,
it
was
at
least
a
valid
guideline
and
as
such
is
entitled
to
deference
by
the
courts.
third,
both
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
respondent
claim
that
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
deficit
reduction
act
in
1984,
intended
to
permit
the
california
amendment.
i
would
address
each
of
these
three
contentions
in
turn:
the
primary
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
a
certain
manual
provision,
the
so-called
rom
2572-d,
was
a
legislative
regulation.
no
one
seeks
to
defend
this
theory
in
this
court
and
with
good
reason.
the
manual
provision
in
question
is
part
of
a
loose-leaf
manual
intended
by
use
by
agency
employees
only.
it
was
not
approved
by
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services,
the
only
person
in
the
agency
who
has
the
authority
to
issue
substantive
regulations;
it
was
not
issued
after
public
notice
and
comment
procedures
as
is
required
by
the
apa
and
longstanding
agency
policy;
it
was
not
published
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations;
indeed,
it
was
not
even
published
in
the
federal
register,
the
requisite
for
all
substantive
regulations
under
the
apa.
the
court
of
appeals
rationale
simply
cannot
be
squared
with
fundamental
tenets
of
administrative
law.
as
judge
kozinski
put
it,
"it
would
create
uncertainty;
breed
litigation;
and
invite
judicial
intrusion
into
the
affairs
of
administrative
agencies.
"
although
they
disclaim
any
reliance
on
the
court
of
appeals
theory,
respondents
nevertheless
argue
that
the
manual
provision
is
a
valid
guideline,
and
as
such,
is
entitled
to
deference
by
the
courts.
we
agree
that
agency
manuals
can
be
important
sources
for
resolving
legal
disputes
that
arise
under
the
social
security
act.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no,
justice
white.
there
is
no
indication
that
the
so-called
rom
provision>
["]
was
in
fact
ever
applied
in
any
particular
case
involving
any
state,
let
alone
this
state.
when
the
provision
was
drawn
to
the
attention
of
the
administrator
in
this
state
it
was
promptly
disavowed
and
the
administrator
consistently
held
that
it
violated
the
state
statute
and
regulations.
there
is
a
reference
in
the
rom
to
the
state
of
montana,
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
we
can
locate
that
montana
in
fact
ever
attempted
to
set
its
medically
need
income
level
based
on
a
family
of
three
for
couples
rather
than
two.
the
contention
that
somehow
the
courts
should
give
deference
to
the
rom
provision
in
this
case,
even
if
it
is
not
a
legislatively
binding
regulation,
we
do
not
think
bears
any
scrutiny.
the
decision
in
this
case
was
not
one
to
enforce
the
rom.
the
decision
was
one
to
repudiate
the
manual.
in
this
context,
if
the
manual
is
not
a
legislatively-binding
regulation,
then
the
only
questions
it
presented
are
whether
the
agency
adopted
a
rational
construction
of
its
own
statute
and
regulations,
and
in
light
of
that
interpretation,
whether
its
decision
to
repudiate
the
manual
is
arbitrary,
capricious,
or
an
abuse
of
discretion.
we
do
not
think
there
can
be
any
serious
dispute
about
the
answers
to
these
inquiries.
even
if
one
somehow
imagines
that
section
1903(f)
creates
an
ambiguity
and
allows
the
secretary
to
determine
that
"same
size"
means
that
a
couple
is
different
from
a
family
of
two,
the
administrator
did
not
interpret
this
statute
that
way.
the
administrator
in
this
case
found
that
the
same
size
family
means
what
it
says,
that
a
"couple"
is
a
"family
of
two",
and
not
a
"family
of
three".
this
was
clearly
a
rational
construction
of
the
statute
and
once
that
construction
was
made
it
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
agency
manual
had
to
be
repudiated.
an
agency
manual
simply
cannot
trump
a
duly-enacted
statute
of
congress
or
a
duly-promulgated
agency
regulation.
nor
do
we
think
there
can
be
any
contention
in
this
case
that
california
relied
to
its
detriment
on
the
agency
manual.
in
april
1983,
the
california
department
of
health
services
prepared
an
analysis
of
proposed
legislation
that
ultimately
led
to
the
state
plan
amendment
at
issue
in
this
case.
that
analysis
noted
that,
"regional
office
manual
provisions
have
no
regulatory
authority.
"
and
it
cautioned
that,
"federal
approval
would
very
likely
not
be
granted.
"
later
in
august
1983,
the
same
california
department
again
concluded
that
the
california
amendment
was
in
violation
of
the
federal
cap.
to
make
doubly
sure,
the
california
department
wrote
to
the
administrator
and
asked
for
a
formal
opinion
about
whether
or
not
the
proposed
plan
would
be
acceptable
under
federal
law.
the
administrator
wrote
back
in
september
of
1983
and
unequivocally
informed
the
department
that
its
proposed
plan
would
violate
section
1903(f)
and
the
implementing
regulations.
notwithstanding
these
repeated
warnings,
that
the
manual
provision
was
unlawful
and
that
the
proposed
plan
amendment
would
be
disapproved,
california
filed
its
amendment
anyway.
we
would
submit
that
this
history
demonstrates
that,
although
california
was
no
doubt
attempting
to
exploit
the
manual,
it
was
not
in
any
sense
relying
on
it.
the
final
argument
that
has
been
advanced
for
avoiding
the
plain
language
of
section
1903(f)
in
the
regulations
is
based
on
the
so-called
defra
moratorium>
["].
section
2373
of
the
deficit
reduction
act,
or
defra>
["],
directs
the
secretary
not
to
take
any
compliance
action
against
a
state
by
reason
of
the
state's
medicaid
plan
being
in
violation
of
a
certain
provision
of
the
medicaid
statute.
the
section
that
is
referred
to
in
the
moratorium
is
the
subsection
of
section
1902(a)
of
the
medicaid
statute,
a
provision
that
had
been
added
by
the
tax
equity
and
fiscal
responsibility
act
of
1982
or
tefra.
the
moratorium
does
not
mention
section
1903(f),
the
4/3rds
cap
on
federal
financial
participation
which
was
relied
upon
by
the
administrator
in
this
case.
so
the
short
answer
to
the
defra
moratorium
argument,
and
we
think
the
complete
answer,
is
that
the
moratorium
concerns
a
different
statutory
requirement
not
relied
upon
by
the
administrator
and
is
simply
irrelevant.
the
legislative
history
confirms
this
analysis.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
defra
moratorium,
as
the
legislative
history
makes
clear,
was
to
give
the
states
greater
flexibility
in
measuring
income
and
resources
in
determining
medicaid
eligibility.
as
this
court
explained
in
its
opinion
in
adkins
v
rivera,
tefra
required
the
states
to
use
the
same
methodology
in
measuring
and
resources
for
all
goods
of
medicaid
recipients.
defra
imposed
a
moratorium
on
this
provision.
this
case
does
not
present
any
issue
about
measurement
of
income
and
resources.
it
concerns
only
the
cap
on
federal
financial
participation
that
applies
after
the
measurement
process
is
complete.
tefra
also
required
the
states
to
use
a
single
standard
of
eligibility
requirements
for
all
groups
of
medicaid
recipients.
after
tefra
was
enacted,
some
agency
employees,
although
not
the
administrator,
interpreted
the
single
standard
to
mean,
among
other
things,
that
the
states
had
to
set
the
same
eligibility
requirements
for
families
consisting
of
one
adult
and
a
child
and
families
consisting
of
two
adults.
if
this
were
the
correct
interpretation,
then
the
defra
moratorium
would
mean
that
states
could
now
set
different
eligibility
standards
for
adult
couples
and
families
consisting
of
one
adult
and
a
child.
but
just
because
the
states
can
set
different
relative
standards
for
families
consisting
of
two
adults
and
families
consisting
of
an
adult
and
a
child
does
not
mean
that
either
standard
can
correlate
the
cap
set
by
section
1403(f)...
1903(f),
excuse
me,
of
the
act.
to
return
to
my
earlier
example,
if
the
amount
ordinarily
paid
to
an
afdc
family
of
two
is
$300,
and
the
section
1903(f)
cap
for
a
family
of
two
is
therefore
$400,
defra
would
permit
a
state
to
set
the
medically
needy
income
level
for
an
adult
couple
at
$400,
and
to
set
the
medically
needy
income
level
for
a
family
consisting
of
one
adult
and
a
child
at
something
lower,
such
as
$350.
but
there
is
nothing
in
defra
that
permits
states
to
violate
the
federal
cap
either
for
adult
couples
or
for
any
other
type
of
family.
if
there
were
any
doubt
at
all
about
this
it
has
been
resolved
by
a
recent
amendment
to
the
defra
moratorium
enacted
just
this
past
august
designed
to
clarify
which
provisions
of
the
medicaid
act
are
covered
by
the
moratorium.
this
enactment
is
not
simply
a
post-enactment
legislative
history
because
congress
specifically
made
the
effective
date
of
the
clarification
retroactive
back
to
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
defra.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
it
was
in
august.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
clarification
that
was
passed
in
august
that
suggests
that
congress
was
aiming
at
this
particular
case.
there
is
a
bill--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
no.
the
clarification
that
was
passed
in
august
was
intended
to
clarify
that
the
moratorium
on
tefra
extended
to
certain
issues
under
tefra
that
were
not
absolutely
clear
under
the
initial
moratorium.
the
august
clarification
does
not
mention
1903(f)
and
we
suggest
that
the
failure
to
mention
1903(f)
in
the
clarification
establishes
what
we
said
in
the
initial
moratorium
intended,
which
was
not
to
cover
1903(f)
either.
so
the
main
purpose
of
congress
was
to
broaden
the
moratorium
with
respect
to
some
other
issues
and
they
clearly
did
not
include
1903(f)
in
these
other
issues
that
were
being
clarified.
the
senate
report
has
a
sentence
that
expressly
says
1903(f)
is
not
covered>
["].
now,
what
you
may
be
referring
to
is
a
recent
enactment
by
the
house,
the
so-called,
afdc
level
for
a
family
of
three.
so
the
waxman
bill
seems
to
be
in
a
sense
an
attempt
by
congress
to
determine
the
outcome
of
this
particular
litigation.
but
that
has
not
yet
passed
the
senate.
it
would
be
entirely
a
matter
of
speculation
as
to
what
happened--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--yes,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
everyone
finds
it
hard
to
follow
the
moratorium,
justice
stevens.
what
august
did,
this
last
august,
what
congress
did
this
last
august
was
it
clarified
the
1984
moratorium
by
saying
that,
"in
addition
to
the
subsection
of
1902(a)
that
we
initially
mentioned,
the
following
three
subsections
were
also
governed
by
the
moratorium.
"
it
did
not
mention
1903(f),
as
the
original
moratorium
did
not
mention
1903(f).
we
just
say
that,
we
just
cite
this
as
confirmation
of
the
proposition
of
the
original
moratorium
did
not
have
any
application
to
this
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
it
does
do
that,
yes.
but
the
fact
that--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--that
is
correct.
i
mean,
i
do
not
think...
there
is
clearly
a
dispute
going
on
between
california
and
hhs
over
whether
or
not
the
original
defra
moratorium
applies
to
1903(f).
presumably
some
people
in
congress,
at
least,
were
made
aware
of
this
dispute.
in
august
1987,
congress
clarified
the
defra
moratorium
and
in
doing
that
it
did
not
state
that
the
1903(f)
was
covered
by
the
moratorium.
we
think
that
that
is
fairly
conclusive
evidence
that
neither
the
original
moratorium
nor
the
new
moratorium
were
intended
to
have
anything
to
do
with
section
1903(f).
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
i
think
you
can
argue
that
in
this
case
it
does,
justice
scalia,
because
as
i
mentioned,
congress
made
the
effective
date
of
the
clarification
retroactive
to
the
date
of
the
original
moratorium.
now,
if
that
is
permissible,
and
we
do
not
take
any
position
on
that,
the
new
legislation
is
in
effect
the
governing
law
that
would
apply
throughout
the
period
in
controversy
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no.
the
moratorium
was
to
last
for
18
months
after
the
secretary
filed
a
report
with
congress.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
about
the
effect
of
having
different
methodologies
for
measuring
different
income
between
medically
needy
medicaid
families
and
other
types
of
medicaid
families
under
the
categorical
programs.
the
secretary
missed
the
initial
deadline
for
filing
that
report.
it
has
now
been
filed,
and
so
the
moratorium
expires
18
months
from
this
past
august.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
it
is
still
in
effect,
that
is
correct.
in
concluding,
i
would
just
like
to
emphasize
what
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case:
this
case
does
not
concern
the
power
of
states
like
california
to
afford
a
greater
medicaid
benefits
to
adult
couples.
the
issue
is
who
to
pay
for
such
benefits
once
they
had
been
made
available.
congress
had
given
the
states
broad
discretion
to
set
eligibility
standards.
but
congress
has
also
set
a
cap
on
federal
financial
participation
equal
to
4/3rds
of
the
highest
level
of
benefits
paid
to
an
afdc
family
of
the
same
size.
if
california
wants
more
federal
dollars
for
the
medically
needy,
it
can
increase
the
size
of
its
afdc
benefits,
which
would
automatically,
through
application
of
the
statutory
formula
increase
the
size
of
the
federal
cap.
alternatively,
it
can
increase
medicaid
benefits
for
adult
couples
and
can
arrange
to
pay
for
the
excess
benefits
above
the
federal
cap
itself.
what
it
cannot
do
under
existing
law
is
to
file
an
amended
plan
that
violates
the
federal
cap
and
insists
that
the
federal
government
reimburse
it
for
amounts
in
excess
of
the
cap.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
four
minutes
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
promise
not
to
take
12
minutes:
the
secretary's
position
in
this
case
is
clear
and
straightforward.
section
1903(f)
of
the
social
security
act
specifically
sets
a
cap
on
federal
financial
participation
based
on
the
afdc
benefits
levels
of
families
of
the
same
size
as
those
in
the
medically-needy
group.
the
secretary
has
construed
the
language,
afdc
family
of
"three".
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
sure.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
justice
stevens,
we
hope
that
this
case
does
not
come
down
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
language
of
rom
says,
"between
one
and
three",
can
be
stretched
to
include
"three".
that
we
did
make
the
point
in
the
court
below
that
rom
itself
did
not
permit
what
california
was
doing
because
"between
one
and
three"
means
"one
dollar
less
than
three".
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no,
justice
stevens,
we
think
that
the
case
should
be...
can
be,
decided
on
other
grounds.
our
position,
i
think,
is
relatively
straightforward;
the
position
that
the
respondents
take
is
very
hard
to
follow.
essentially
california
has
put
forward
three
statements
of
fact
in
its
presentation.
none
of
these
are
by
themselves
are
inaccurate.
but
they
are
radically
incomplete.
first,
california
stated
that,
in
1983
an
official
of
the
hhs
sent
a
letter
to
california
and
to
other
regional
offices
stating
that
the
rom
violated
tefra.
second,
that
it--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--yes,
there
is
such
a
letter.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
saying
that.
that
rom
violates
tefra.
second,
california
points
out
that
the
house
in
the
bill
that
was
passed
in
1983
specifically
disapproved
the
secretary'
repudiation
of
the
rom.
third,
california
states
that
the
conference
committee
opposed
a
moratorium
on
tefra.
now,
there
are
tremendous
gaps
in
this
presentation,
and
when
the
gaps
are
filled
in,
the
persuasiveness
of
the
argument
completely
disappears.
first
of
all,
the
administrator
of
the
health
care
financing
administration
consistently
stated
that
the
california
proposal
violated
section
1903(f)
and
the
secretary's
implementing
regulations.
it
is
true
that
there
were
certain
expressions
of
opinion
that
the
california
plan
also
violated
tefra,
but
the
secretary...
the
administrator,
ultimately
did
not
rely
on
the
violation
of
tefra;
the
administrator
relied
on
the
violation
of
section
1903(f).
secondly,
although
the
house
passed
a
bill
which
disapproved
the
secretary's
repudiation
of
the
rom,
the
house
bill
was
never
enacted
into
law.
the
relevant
passage
in
the
conference
report,
which
is
reproduced
in
our
brief
on
pages
44
and
45,
is
quite
explicit:
it
describes
the
present
law
as
being
the
cap
set
by
section
1903(f);
it
states
that
the
house
bill
permits
the
states
to
establish
medically-needy
levels
for
families
of
two
adults
up
to
the
133.33
percent
of
the
three-person
afdc
standard;
it
says
that
the
senate
had
no
provision,
and
describes
the
conference
agreement
as
follows:
"the
conference
agreement
does
not
include
the
house
provision.
"
so
the
conference
disapproved
the
house
bill
specifically
in
passing
the
defra
moratorium.
finally,
it
is
true
that
the
defra
moratorium
placed
a
moratorium
on
tefra,
but
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
grounds
on
which
the
secretary
relied
in
disapproving
the
california
plan,
which
is
1903(f).
the
text
of
the
defra
moratorium
does
not
mention
1903(f).
the
legislative
history,
as
we
stated,
is
quite
clear
that
no
intent...
there
was
no
intent
to
put
in
a
moratorium
in--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--to
be
absolutely
precise,
justice
stevens,
the
administrator
found
that
the
california
plan
violated
section
1903(f),
and
for
that
reason
the
plan
was
in
violation
of
section
1902(a)(4)
and
(a)(19).
the
tefra
provision,
which
was
moratoriumed
by
defra,
is
1902(a)(10)--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--some
agency
employees
offered
the
opinion
that--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--if
there
were
no
moratorium
on
the
secretary
disapproving
state
plans
for
that
reason,
yes,
it
would
be
our
position
that
it
violates
that,
quite
clearly.
but
defra
had
been
enacted
by
the
time
the
administrator
had
reached
her
final
decision
in
this
case,
and
in
the
final
decision
of
the
administrator
there
was
no
reliance
whatsoever
on
tefra
or
the
"single-standard"
provision.
the
sole
reliance
was
based
on
1903(f).
the
other
argument
that
is
put
forward
in
several
different
versions
by
california
is
that,
somehow,
what
the
secretary
is
doing
in
this
case
violates
the
provision
of
tefra,
which
stated
that
the
secretary
was
to
go
back
to
pre-obra
regulations.
the
logic
of
this
completely
escapes
me.
because,
the
defra
moratorium
as
it
has
been
discussed,
puts
a
moratorium
on
tefra,
and
i
do
not
understand
how
a
statute
that
puts
a
moratorium
on
tefra
can
then
be
transposed
into
a
statement
that
somehow,
a
provision
of
tefra
has
to
be
governing
in
this
particular
case?
in
any
event,
even
if
we
do
go
back
to
the
pre-obra
regulations,
the
pre-obra
regulations
are
42
c.f.r.
435.1007,
which
has
been
in
effect
in
the
current
form
since
1971,
and
which
is
the
regulation
which
the
secretary
relied
upon
in
this
case
in
disapproving
california's
state
plan.
the
rom
is
not
a
regulation.
the
rom
is
a
statement
that
appears
in
an
internal
agency
manual;
it
has
none
of
the
indicia
of
a
valid
regulation,
and
has
never
been
regarded
as
a
regulation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
the
solicitor-general
rests.
