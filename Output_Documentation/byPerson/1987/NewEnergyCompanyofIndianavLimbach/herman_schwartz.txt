mr.
herman
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
new
energy
company
of
indiana,
an
indiana
ethanol
producer,
from
the
fourth
redecision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
rehearing
that
rejected
new
energy's
commerce
clause
challenge
to
a
1984
amendment
to
ohio's
sales
tax
credit
for
the
gasoline
ethanol
blend
or
90/10
blend
known
as
gasohol.
prior
to
1985,
ohio
had
granted
a
credit
to
the
motor
vehicle
fuel
tax
for
gasoline
for
gasohol.
on
december
20,
1984,
it
amended
the
statute
by
denying
the
credit
to
gasohol
containing
ethanol
produced
in
another
state
unless
that
foreign
producer
state
grants
a
credit
to
ethanol
sold
there
containing
ohio
produced
ethanol.
the
credit
that
ohio
grants
is
limited
the
amount
of
credit
granted
ohio
ethanol
in
that
other
state.
now,
although
the
ohio
courts
agreed
that
the
reciprocity
provision
effectively
excluded
new
energy
from
the
ohio
ethanol
market,
they
nevertheless
upheld
it.
our
position
is
that
this
1984
amendment
which
was
conceded
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
to
be
a
forced
reciprocity
statute
discriminating
against
out-of-state
products
by
denying
the
tax
credit
unless
the
out-of-state
product's
home
state
provides
a
similar
tax
credit,
must
pass
a
strict
scrutiny
test,
and
that
this
clearly
does
not.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
your
honor,
if
it
grants
a
tax
credit
only
to
ohio
ethanol,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes.
but
that
is
the
kind
of
protection
that
must
meet
the
strictest
of
all
scrutiny.
it's
almost
per
se
illegal,
that
kind
of
tax
credit,
as
this
court
has
found.
a
tax
credit
that's
limited
solely
to
the
in
state
product.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes.
and
states
have
done
that.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes.
and
states
have
done
that.
mr.
herman
schwartz
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
a
tax
credit
is
aimed
in
the
form
in
which
you've
raised
it,
it
is
aimed
almost
explicitly
at
out
of
state
producers.
it
says,
our
people
will
get
this.
it's
a
discriminatory
tax
on
its
face.
it
is
the
kind
of
tax
that
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
the
framers
were
concerned
about
right
from
the
beginning.
mr.
herman
schwartz
right.
it
is,
your
honor,
but
that
kind
of
distinction
is
a
distinction
that
this
court
has
always
made,
and
frequently
made,
because
ultimately
almost
everything
that
a
state
does
when
it
spends
money,
whether
it
spends
money
on
research,
whether
it
spends
money
to
facilitate
matters
in
one
way
or
another
for
its
products,
is
an
expenditure
of
money
on
behalf
of
its
own.
for
example,
in
the
hunt
case,
the
court
pointed
out...
and
i
think
that
was
unanimous...
that
the
state
of
washington
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
to
develop
a
grading
system
for
washington
apples.
and
when
north
carolina
tried
to
match
that
by
taking
away
that
advantage
that
the
state
of
washington
had
created,
this
court
unanimously
said,
you
can't
do
that.
it's
okay
to
spend
money.
but
when
you
discriminate,
when
you
set
up
a
tax
system
and
it
is
discriminatory
taxes
that
the
commerce
clause
is
historically
aimed
at,
when
you
set,
and
which
this
court
has
again
and
again
struck
down--
mr.
herman
schwartz
--that's
right.
and
the
court
did
so
itself,
your
honor.
in
alexandria
scrap
and
in
the
cases
subsequent
to
alexandria
scrap,
reeves,
the
others,
particularly
in
justice
blackmun's
discussion
in
reeves
of
the
market
participant
doctrine,
the
court
said,
the
commerce
clause
is
aimed
at
regulation
and
direct
taxes.
it
is
not
aimed
at
the
situation
where
a
state
enters
the
market.
it
is
not
aimed
at
the
situation
where
perhaps
the
state
even
spends
its
own
money.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that.
mr.
herman
schwartz
because
it
is
not
a
tax.
i
think--
mr.
herman
schwartz
--well,
you
can
spend
your
money
in
any
way
you
want
so
long
as
you're
not
taxing.
you
can
spend
money
on
anything
you
want
in
your
own
state.
mr.
herman
schwartz
well,
i
think
that's
right
because
i
think
at
that
point,
it
comes
close
to
the
market
participant
doctrine
although
there
is
a
danger
that
that
doctrine
could
swallow
up
the
entire
situation.
in
the
tax
area
again
and
again,
your
honor,
and
i
think
you
would
referred
to
this
yourself
last
year
in
the
scheiner
case,
things
would
seem
the
same
which
have
the
same
effect
will
nevertheless
produce
different
kinds
of
results.
we
are
dealing
here,
as
i
think
the
court
said
in,
i
think
justice
holmes
said
it
in
towne
against
eisner
where
a
page
of
history
is
worth
a
page
of
logic.
mr.
herman
schwartz
pardon?
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
stand
corrected.
a
volume
of
logic.
in
fact,
it's
much
better.
the
point
is
lost
in
my
version
and
it's
reinforced
in
yours.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
precisely
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
states
can
spend
their
own
money.
they
can
do
it
in
the
manner
they
choose.
but
the
tax
structure
has
so
many
possibilities
of
discrimination
built
into
it,
and
it's
historically
so
dangerous
because
the
alternative,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
would
be
to
have
to
repudiate
a
line
of
cases
that
goes
back
to
welton
against
missouri
in
which
states
again
and
again
have
said,
we
are
trying
to
help
our
local
industry.
the
hawaiian
case
just
a
few
years
ago,
they
said
here
is
this
struggling
little
brandy,
okolehau
brandy...
to
an
easterner,
that's
a
little
hard
to
pronounce,
this
little
product
which
has
almost
no
market,
and
then
there's
this
pineapple
wine
which
has
no
market
at
all.
and
we
will
give
them
a
tax
exemption
from
the
twenty
percent
tax
that
we've
established.
the
court
said...
and
on
this
point,
i
think
there
was
no
dissent...
i
think
there
was
a
dissent
on
the
implications
of
the
21st
amendment,
on
this
point
the
court
said,
you
just
can't
do
that.
you
can't
help
your
own
industry
by
a
discriminatory
tax.
now,
if
i
may
take
a
minute
to
sort
of
recollect
where
i
was
in
my
argument.
now,
to
go
back,
some
ethanol
was
sold
in
ohio
in
1979
and
1980,
but
in
1981,
the
same
year
new
energy's
ohio
competitor,
southpoint
ethanol,
which
is
an
intervenor
in
this
case,
was
formed,
ohio
adopted
a
sales
tax
credit
for
all
ethanol
sold
in
ohio.
it
was
about
3.5
cents
a
gallon
of
gasohol,
which
ultimately
fell
to
2.5
cents.
indiana
had
a
comparable
fuel
tax
credit
which
it
repealed
in
early
'84,
effective
july,
'85,
and
it
authorized
at
that
time
a
production
subsidy
which
in
fact
was
dropped
a
year
later
again
on
july
'86.
in
the
fall
of
1984,
new
energy
went
into
production
in
indiana.
and
southpoint's
sales
in
indiana
began
to
fall
sharply.
on
december
20th,
the
ohio
reciprocity
provision
was
enacted.
as
the
trial
court
found,
southpoint
had
lobbied
the
ohio
legislature
for
this
provision,
in
fact,
stressing
to
the
legislature...
and
the
word
stressing
was
used
twice
by
the
southpoint
witness...
how
important
southpoint
was
to
the
most
depressed
areas
of
the
ohio
economy.
this
reciprocity
provision
which
also,
by
the
way,
excluded
ethanol
from
almost
all
gas-fired
plants
and
ethanol
made
from
cane
and
beet
sugar,
this
was
done
in
order
to
pressure
indiana
to
restore
the
indiana
tax
credit,
and
in
fact
it
was
aimed
only
at
indiana,
for
every
other
state
that
could
be
affected
by
this
tax
credit,
the
producers
in
other
states
like
tennessee,
illinois
and
elsewhere
already
had
a
credit
which
they
were
giving.
now,
loss
of
the
ohio
tax
credit,
when
all
of
the
new
energy's
competitors
continued
to
get
this
credit
inevitably
excluded
new
energy
from
the
ohio
market,
as
the
trial
court
found.
when
new
energy
challenged
this
statute,
the
trial
court
found
two,
and
only
two
legislative
purposes.
and
i'd
like
to
quote
that,
if
i
may.
"to
promote
domestic
industry
and
to
affect
the
policies
of
other
states.
"
the
court
nevertheless
upheld
the
statute
because--
mr.
herman
schwartz
--right,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
schwartz
your
honor,
that's
a-troubling
point.
i
had
a
lot
of
trouble
understanding
that
finding.
the
first
sentence
says,
it
is
conceivable
that
there
were
other
purposes.
one
of
these
was...
now
if
conceivable
modifies
everything
which
is
actually
all
there
is,
then
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
such
finding.
and
indeed
when
one
looks
at
the
intermediate
appellate
court's
opinion,
which
lists
the
purposes,
it
does
not
include
that.
mr.
herman
schwartz
not
at
all,
your
honor,
because
if
it
were,
there
would
still
be
a
least
drastic
alternative
test.
after
all,
in
dean
milk
and
many
other
cases,
the
court
said,
and
in
hunt,
for
example,
the
court
said
we
accept
that
this
is
a
legitimate
bona
fide
purpose.
however,
you
have
to
apply
the
least
drastic
alternative.
and
in
this
case,
i
planned
to
get
to
it
shortly,
but
i
could
get
to
it
right
now,
there
is
just
no
question
that
this
is
not
the
least
drastic
alternative.
how
in
the
world
do
you
increase
the
amount
of
ethanol
by
excluding
ethanol
just
because
it
comes
from
a
state
that
uses
a
different
incentive,
because
it
comes
from
a
coal-fired
plant,
because
it
is
made
of
cane
or
beet
sugar.
indeed,
it's
counterproductive
to
that
because
new
energy's
loss
of
the
market
may
have
gone
to
gasoline,
not
to
gasohol,
in
which
case
the
amount
of
pollution
in
the
air
would
multiply
rather
than
be
reduced.
now,
despite
these
findings
which,
again
with
the
ambiguity
that
you've
pointed
to,
the
court
nevertheless
upheld
the
statute
because
new
energy
was
the
only
producer
affected
and
would
not
have
been
affected
had
indiana
not
repealed
the
tax
credit.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes,
there
are,
but
of
course,
it
depends
on
the
method
of
influence.
there
is
nothing
wrong
inherently
in
trying
to
influence
the
policies
of
other
states.
it
depends
on
how
you
do
it.
indeed,
even
under
the
equal
protection
clause
where
that
is
an
even
more
acceptable
purpose
in
the
metropolitan
life
case,
the
court
said,
you
can
try
to
influence
other
states,
but
you
can't
do
it
by
discriminating
in
taxes.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
is
in
itself
neutrally
there's
no
problem
about
trying
to
influence.
if
for
example,
you
try
to
influence
by
improving
the
economic
climate
say
by
i
suppose
a
right
to
work
law
or
some
other
kind
of
economic
or
friendly
regulatory
climate,
other
states
obviously
may
try
to
respond
in
other
ways.
mr.
herman
schwartz
that
objective,
yes,
your
honor,
yes.
to
influence
is
correct,
but
it
depends
on
how
you
do
it.
mr.
herman
schwartz
if
that
were
the
least
drastic
way
of
dealing
with
that
very
serious
health
problem,
the
answer
would
be,
yes.
mr.
herman
schwartz
well,
i'm
not
quite
sure
by,
this
situation,
but
the
cases
i
rely
on
are
dean
milk.
mr.
herman
schwartz
yes.
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
i'm
quite
sure
that
it
did
use
the
term.
and
i
think
the
a&p
case
did
as
well.
mr.
herman
schwartz
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
i
think
as
i
recall
justice
black
was
unhappy
because
it
was
using
first
amendment
doctrine,
and
i
think
he
commented
on
that.
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
the
phrase
in
a&p
there's
one
reference
here
to
less
drastic
alternative,
and
there
are
i
think
other
ways
in
which
the
court
stressed
that
you've
got
to
look
at
other
alternatives
that
create
less
problems.
indeed,
the
pike
v.
bruce
church
test
itself
says
that
even
when
something
regulates
evenhandedly,
which
i
think
this
does
not,
even
when
something
regulates
evenhandedly
under
those
circumstances,
and
for
a
legitimate
purpose,
you
still
have
to
look
to
see
where
there
are
other
ways
that
could
accomplish
the
same
thing.
mr.
herman
schwartz
right.
mr.
herman
schwartz
well,
your
honor,
even
if
it's
not
least
drastic,
the
court
certainly
has
insisted
on
less
burdensome,
and
there
are
less
burdensome.
indeed,
the
initial
statute,
the
initial
tax
credit
in
ohio
in
1981
which
allowed
the
credit
for
ethanol,
just
like
that,
ethanol
or
methanol
itself
was
quite
an
adequate
alternative
without
the
reciprocity.
we
are
not
challenging
the
tax
credit
which
was
made
available
in
'81
to
everyone.
we're
challenging
the
reciprocity
and
we're
saying
that
the
tax
credit
without
the
reciprocity
which
now
some
eleven
states
have
and
which
in
1985
approximately
23
states
had,
that
that
is
a
less
burdensome
alternative
which
accomplishes
the
same
purpose.
after
all,
over
the
years,
the
rate
of
usage
of
ethanol,
of
gasohol,
i
think,
has
risen
from
something
like
400
or
500
million
gallons
to
900
million
gallons
during
this
period
without,
with
very
few
of
these
reciprocity
statutes
operating.
now,
if
i
may
return,
our
argument,
which
is
of
course
what
we've
been
talking
about
here
is
that
reciprocity
statutes
face
strict
scrutiny
and
for
a
very
good
reason.
they
involve
facial
discrimination,
they
create
most
favored
nation
enclaves,
precisely
the
kind
of
preferential
trade
areas
that
the
commerce
clause
is
supposed
to
prevent,
and
they
threaten
economic
isolation
in
an
effort
to
control
the
policies
of
other
states.
all
of
those
i
think
have
been
touched
on
by
this
court.
now,
the
ohio
courts
recognized
the
applicability
of
strict
scrutiny,
but
they
ruled
that
because
others
from
outside
ohio,
besides
new
energy,
could
come
into
ohio,
there
was
no
violation.
now,
that
logic
this
court
has
never
adopted.
in
some
cases
for
example
that
this
court
has
dealt
with,
only
one
out-of-state
company
was
involved.
that's
true
of
the
pike
case,
it's
true
of
lewis
against
bete
investment.
in
a&p,
for
example,
many
other
states,
i
think
it
was
something
like
eight
states,
had
reciprocity
agreements
with
mississippi.
louisiana
did
not.
and
the
court
still
struck
that
down
unanimously.
there
is
no
requirement
either
that
there
be
an
absolute
bar.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
right
from
the
beginning
that
taxes
can
have
the
same
effect
as
an
absolute
bar,
and
in
fact
in
this
case
as
the
trial
court
recognized,
it
had
precisely
that
effect.
new
energy
was
excluded.
the
fact
is
with
the
competitors
getting
the
credit,
there
was
no
way
new
energy
could
compete
in
the
ohio
market.
now,
with
respect
to
the
health
claim,
i
think
i've
already
touched
on
that,
unless
there
are
some
further
questions
on
it.
and
indeed,
there's
some
question
as
to
whether
any
credit
is
necessary
for
health,
because
over
the
years,
there
has
been
a
decline
in
the
use
of
any
tax
credits
and
an
enormous
increase
in
the
use
of
ethanol.
and
as
i
pointed
out
before,
it's
very
possible
that
new
energy's
loss
in
indiana
may
have
been
diverted
not
to
another
ethanol
producer,
but
to
gasoline,
which
in
turn
would
produce
increased
pollution.
and
i
think
the
record
quite
beyond
dispute
shows
that
the
purpose
here
was
to
pressure
indiana
to
restore
that
tax
credit
for
the
benefit
of
the
ohio
competitor,
an
important
employer
in
perhaps
the
most
depressed
area
of
the
state
that
used
a
great
deal
of
ohio
corn
and
coal.
and
as
i
said,
this
was
stressed
at
the
legislative
hearing.
now,
an
argument
has
been
made--
mr.
herman
schwartz
--your
honor,
i
think
the
difference
is,
and
the
case
you're
talking
about
is
obviously
henneford
v.
silas
mason,
that
line
of
case.
mr.
herman
schwartz
right.
oh,
yes,
they're
clearly
tax
cases.
the
difference
is
that
that's
a
situation
in
which
a
state
itself
has
imposed
a
tax
burden
on
its
own
people,
and
it
says
that
we
don't
want
to
hurt
our
own
people
too
much
so
therefore
we
will
equalize
matters
by
saying
that
if
you
buy
something
outside
and
use
it
here,
our
people
will
not
be
at
a
disadvantage.
but
it's
a
disadvantage
that
the
state
itself
created.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
disadvantage
when
the
tax
credit
went
to
everyone,
and
indeed
there
was
no
disadvantage
had
there
been
no
tax
credit
at
all.
ohio
created
a
disadvantage
whereas
in
the
silas
henneford
mason
(sic)
case
by
the
reference
to
other
states,
ohio
undid
a
disadvantage
to
its
people,
or
the
state
of
washington,
actually,
that
the
state
of
washington
itself
had
created.
and
it
was
a
straight
equalizer,
penny
for
penny.
whereas
here,
when
there's
an
attempt
to
equalize
whatever
advantages
other
states
have,
we
have
an
attempt
to
mix
apples
and
pears.
if
for
example
another
state
provides
research
help,
here
we're
providing
a
discriminatory
tax.
there's
no
way
of
knowing
whether
they
are
in
any
way
equal.
henneford
silas
mason
(sic)
it
was
calibrated
exactly
to
the
penny
and
as
i
think
it
was
justice
cardozo
who
said
it,
equality
is
the
hallmark.
not
true
here.
this
statute
does
not
create
equality.
now,
i
have
just
a
couple
of
minutes
more
before
the
close
of
my
argument,
and
i'd
like
to
respond
briefly
if
i
may
make
a
couple
of
points
with
respect
to
as
i
say
justice
o'connor's
raising
before
of
this
issue
of
bounties
and
subsidies
and
market
participant.
the
market
participant
is
a
narrow
doctrine
designed
to
deal
with
that
situation
whereas
the
court
has
said,
and
i
think
the
most
detailed
statement
is
in
reeves
and
i
think
other
justices
have
quoted
that
reeves
statement,
where
the
state
acts
as
the
equivalent
of
a
private
business,
where
it
is
buying
or
it
is
selling
or
it
is
manufacturing.
mr.
herman
schwartz
it
doesn't
explain
it
fully
except
justice
powell
referred
to
the
case
as,
i
think
the
reeves
case
as
a
situation
in
which
the
state
was
really
acting
as
a
purchaser.
what
happened
in
alexandria
scrap,
of
course,--
mr.
herman
schwartz
--yes.
but
the
court,
i
think,
has
characterized
it,
and
indeed
in
the
subsequent
cases
certainly
treated
both
alexandria
scrap
and
the
line
of
cases
as
a
line
of
cases
where
the
states
act
as
a
private
trader.
indeed,
the
justification
i
think
that
was
given
in
reeves
v.
stake
is
that
it
acts
as
a
private
trader
and
may
indeed
even
be
subject
to
the
constraints
of
a
private
trader,
which
a
plurality
of
the
court
then
applied
subsequently
in
the
south
central
timber
case,
imposing
restraints
on
an
alienation
and
in
effect
preventing
an
effort
to
control
a
downstream
operation,
namely,
processing
of
timber.
and
unless
i
think
the
rule
is
cabined
and
limited
that
way,
it
could
easily
swallow
up
the
entire
commerce
clause,
because
again
almost
any
tax
credit
can
be
called
a
tax
expenditure.
and
indeed
an
expenditure.
and
at
that
point,
the
court
would
have
to
reexamine
and
in
effect
overrule
this
lengthy
line
of
cases
which
go
as
recently
as
last
year.
i
think
i
will
sit
down
now
and
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
and
simply
conclude
by
saying
that
this
statute
is
clearly
unconstitutional
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
on
rehearing
the
second
ohio
supreme
court
decision
should
be
overruled
and
reversed.
mr.
herman
schwartz
your
honor,
i
am
not
going
to
take
any
rebuttal
time
unless
the
court
has
questions
for
me.
i
will
however
confess
with
some
embarrassment
that
the
thrust
of
the
chief
justice's
question
about
least
drastic
alternative
was
absolutely
correct.
the
court
in
sporhase
used
the
phrase,
narrowly
tailored.
and
in
some
other
cases,
it
has
referred
to,
less
burdensome
alternatives,
but
has
not
used
that
particular
phrase
of
less
drastic
alternative.
i
don't
have
any
doubt
in
my
mind
judging
by
the
questions
and
so
on
that
the
point
has
been
made
that
that
are
less
burdensome
alternatives,
and
that
this
was
not
narrowly
tailored.
but
i
did
want
to
make
that
clear,
your
honor,
to
correct
what
was
stated
in
my
brief.
