justice
o'connor
mr.
schwartz,
what
if
all
we
had
in
front
of
us
was
an
ohio
statute
that
granted
a
tax
credit
to
producers
of
ethanol
in
ohio,
no
reciprocity
provision.
would
you
be
here,
and
would
you
think
that
posed
a
commerce
clause
problem?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
would
be
true
if
ohio
had
a
serious
concern
about
its
citizens'
health
problems?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
it
couldn't
provide
a
tax
credit
to
encourage
the
production
and
use
of
ethanol
in
ohio?
justice
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
do
you
think
that
ohio
could,
instead
of
a
tax
credit,
give
some
kind
of
bonus
payment
to
producers
of
ethanol
in
ohio?
justice
o'connor
it
could
do
that?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
a
tax
credit
is
essentially
the
same
thing
as
a
bonus?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
it's
a
little
hard
though
to
distinguish
between
an
outright
grant
of
state
money
and
an
extension
of
a
tax
credit?
justice
o'connor
so
you
would
just
distinguish
the
alexandria
scrap
type
situation
based
on
the
fact
that
this
is
within
the
tax
structure?
justice
o'connor
may
i
stop
you
on
that
point
just
for
a
moment.
the
court
did
also
adopt
appellees'
additional
finding
of
purpose.
justice
o'connor
and
it
isn't
altogether
clear
to
me
whether
or
not
there
was
an
additional
purpose
to
provide
a
cleaner
and
safer
environment
for
ohio
citizens.
justice
o'connor
if
it
was
a
purpose
of
the
legislature,
how
does
that
affect
the
legal
analysis?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
doesn't
explain
alexandria
scrap,
i
don't
think.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
don't
think
so.
the
situation
appears
at
least
to
be
one
where
the
state
wanted
to
encourage
disposal
of
the
old
auto
hulks,
just
like
ohio
might
want
to
encourage
the
use
of
ethanol.
justice
o'connor
well,
it's
giving
a
tax
credit
which
has
the
same
economic
effect
as
a
subsidy,
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
have
we
ever
applied
the
market
participant
theory
to
a
tax
scheme
in
a
state?
justice
o'connor
--and
that
purpose
is
the
health
and
environment
purpose?
justice
o'connor
well,
has
the
court
required
a
close
fit,
even
if
the
purpose
is
legitimate?
in
other
words,
does
the
scheme
have
to
fit
very
closely
to
that
legitimate
purpose?
and
does
this
kind
of
reciprocity
provision
meet
that
kind
of
requirement?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
farrin,
this
court
so
far
has
invalidated
all
these
reciprocity
laws.
it
did
so
in
sporhase
v.
nebraska;
it
did
it
in
a&p
tea
company;
it
did
it
in
baldwin
v.
seelig.
dean
milk.
i
mean,
find
some
cases
where
we've
upheld
this
kind
of
a
scheme.
justice
o'connor
i
don't
think
the
court
has
distinguished
between
an
absolute
ban
and
a
substantial
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
