mr.
richard
c.
farrin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
twofold.
the
first
issue
to
be
decided
is
whether
the
ohio
tax
credit
scheme
is
the
type
of
state
action
that
is
subject
to
the
restraints
of
the
commerce
clause.
within
this
one
issue
there
are
actually
two
questions
to
be
considered
by
the
court.
initially
as
this
court
has
heard
during
the
initial
argument
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
the
market
participant
principle
applies
to
the
ethanol
tax
credit
scheme.
the
second
issue,
which
is
also
a
matter
that
was
touched
upon
by
this
court
in
the
alexandria
scrap
case
but
not
decided,
is
whether
the
commerce
clause
prohibits
state
action
effecting
a
flow
of
commerce
that
is
dependent
for
its
existence
upon
a
state
subsidy
rather
than
on
the
private
market.
the
second
issue
is
whether
assuming
this
scheme
is
subject
to
the
commerce
clause
restrictions,
whether
it
is
valid
under
the
various
tests
established
by
this
court.
as
new
energy's
counsel
has
pointed
out,
the
ohio
general
assembly
initially
enacted
its
tax
credit
provision
in
1981
to
provide
an
encouragement
for
the
use
of
ethanol
as
a
substitute
for
lead
in
gasoline.
the
result
of
this
use
would
be
to
protect
the
environment
of
ohio
because
as
has
been
stipulated
throughout
these
proceedings,
ethanol
is
the
most
environmentally
benign
substitute
for
lead
in
gasoline.
other
benefits
of
the
use
of
ethanol
are
the
creation
of
an
alternative
market
for
corn
and
a
reduction
of
the
country's
dependency
on
foreign
oil.
it's
undisputed
that
these
purposes
are
legitimate
purposes
for
the
state
to
pursue.
the
portion
of
the
scheme
that
is
the
subject
of
the
challenge
before
this
court
is
the
enactment
in
1984
which
became
effective
in
1985
of
the
reciprocity
provision
that
limited
the
credit
given
to
motor
vehicle
fuel
dealers
to
the
use
of
ethanol
that
was
produced
either
in
ohio
or
in
any
other
state
that
granted
similar
credits
for
the
use
of
ethanol
to
ohio
dealers
to
ohio
produced
ethanol.
this
scheme,
including
the
reciprocity
scheme,
does
not
put
any
prohibition
on
the
sale
or
distribution
of
ethanol
in
ohio,
nor
does
it
regulate
the
conditions
under
which
the
flow
of
ethanol
may
occur
in
ohio.
by
this
scheme,
ohio
has
simply
entered
the
market
by
providing
a
subsidy
to
build
up
the
price
of
ethanol.
this
subsidy
is
necessary
in
order
for
ethanol
to
compete
with
gasoline
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
stevens,
i
believe
ohio
entered
the
market
initially
when
it
first
enacted
the
credit
provision
1981.
its
purpose
at
that
point
in
time
was
the
same,
to
bid
up
the
price
of
ethanol
so
that
it
might
compete
with
gasoline
in
the
marketplace.
because
of
the
production
costs
involved
with
ethanol,
absent
both
federal
and
state
subsidies,
ethanol
simply
could
not
compete
in
the
free
private
marketplace
with
gasoline.
and
the
evidence
in
the
record
affirms
that
fact.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
scalia,
initially
i
think
from
an
economic
standpoint,
that's
a
very
unlikely
event.
secondly,
i
don't
think
this
case
requires
the
court
to
so
hold.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
to
simply
use
a
tax
exemption
to
favor
local
business
with
no
other
purpose,
i
do
not
believe
would
be
constitutional,
justice
scalia.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
your
honor,
i
submit
under
alexandria
scrap
that
a
direct
subsidy
may
in
fact
be
unlimited.
i
think
that
case
leaves
the
future
unclear
as
to
how
it
will
be
applied
as
it
goes
along
the
spectrum
to
the
point
that's
suggested
in
your
question.
i
submit
though
that
at
the
least,
alexandria
scrap
would
allow
a
state
to
subsidize
a
local
industry
if
it
was
part
of
a
scheme
that
was
effected
to
carry
out
a
legitimate
state
purpose
other
than
simply
protectionism.
in
alexandria
scrap,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
effect
the
removal
of
abandoned
hulks
in
the
state.
in
this
case,
the
primary
purpose
of
the
ethanol
credit
scheme
is
not
solely
to
benefit
ohio
business.
its
purpose
is
to
encourage
the
use
of
ethanol
which
will
have
great
environmental
benefits
in
the
state
of
ohio,
plus
it
will
have
other
benefits
including
the
increased
market
for
corn
and
reduction
on
the
dependency
of
foreign
oil.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
kennedy,
i
was
speaking
of
the
scheme
as
a
whole,
and
i
think
that's
what
alexandria
scrap
looked
at,
the
scheme
as
a
whole
was
intended
to
further
a
legitimate
state
purpose.
one
aspect
of
the
scheme--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
the
record
indicates
whether
or
not
it
did
help
ohio
producers
or
whether
it
was
intended
to
help
ohio
producers
viz
a
viz
their
foreign
competitors.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
i
would
be
amazed
if
it
hurt
ohio
producers,
justice
kennedy.
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
alexandria
scrap,
the
same
exact
situation
was
present
there.
maryland
first
enacted
their
scheme
which
provided
subsidies
to
scrap
processors.
there's
no
difference
in
the--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--justice
kennedy,
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
of
maryland
was
purchasing
hulks
in
the
alexandria
scrap.
they
were
simply
giving
subsidies
to
processors
who
bought
hulks.
in
this
case,
ohio
is
giving
subsidies
to
motor
vehicle
fuel
dealers
who
buy
ethanol
and
use
it
in
creating
gasohol.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
o'connor,
that's
correct,
it's
a
tax
credit,
but
i
submit
that
it
would
be
extremely
formalistic
to
suggest
that
it
is
different
in
form.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
no,
justice
o'connor,
this
court
has
not.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
stevens,
the
reason
why
ohio
is
attempting
to
encourage
other
states
to
pass
similar
credits
is
so
that
ethanol
will
be
used
in
those
states.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
stevens,
i
think
ohio
is
also
legitimately
concerned
in
the
clean
air
of
other
states.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
stevens,
that
air
comes
into
ohio.
i
don't
think
the
environment
can
stop
at
the
state
lines.
when
you're
interested
in
cleaning
up
polluted
air,
you
can't
say
if
we
just
use
it
in
ohio,
our
air
will
be
clean.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
there's
simply
no
legislative
history
in
this
matter.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
decisions
of
this
court
that
suggest
a
state
cannot
encourage
other
states
to
act.
we're
simply
encouraging
the
other
states
to
pass
similar
credits
so
that
there'll
be
a
national
market
for
ethanol.
another
point
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
is
that
the
nature
of
the
ethanol
industry
is
such
that
it
can't
exist
if
there
are
simply
a
few
states
which
allow
credits
so
that
it
can
compete
with
gasoline.
in
those
states
in
which
no
credits
are
given,
the
ethanol
industry
will
not
exist
because
it
can't
compete
in
the
private
marketplace
with
gasoline.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
yes,
i
do,
justice
stevens.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
it
would
help
the
industry
greatly
if
indiana
took
the
encouragement
of
ohio
and
passed
some
type
of
a
credit
for
ethanol.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
stevens,
i--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--i
don't
submit
that
one
might
be
better
than
the
other,
but
i
do
submit
that
it
would
have
no
difference
in
effect.
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
distinguish
a
straight
subsidy
program,
such
as
in
alexandria
scrap
from
doing
the
same
thing
through
the
granting
of
tax
credits.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
stevens,--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--i
would
first
say
that
there's
nothing
at
all
in
the
record
to
suggest
that.
i
would
submit
that
the
greater
assumption,
and
the
assumption
that
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
made
on
what
evidence
there
was
in
the
record
was
that
it
would
be
replaced
from
ethanol
produced
in
other
states
which
do
have
such
ethanol
credits.
the
evidence
indicated
that
the
largest
and
most
aggressive
producer
of
ethanol
in
the
country
was
archer
daniel
midland
out
of
illinois
and
they
have
the
ability
to
fully
fill
any
void
in
the
market
that
might
be
left
by
new
energy's
leaving
that
market.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
scalia,
if
you're
referring
simply
to
a
subsidy
provision
such
as
the
one
that
indiana
had
at
one
time,
i'm
not
aware
that
there
are
any,
if
many,
of
those
types
of
provisions.
most
of
the
states
that
i'm
aware
of
have
addressed
this
problem
through
their
tax
system.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
scalia,
i'm
not
an
expert
on
agriculture,
but
it
would
not
surprise
me
that
those
states
that
have
large
corn
surpluses
would
find
that
also
to
be
an
additional
reason
for
encouraging
the
use
of
ethanol,
because
clearly
the
more
ethanol
that
is
used,
the
more
corn,
which
is
a
primary
raw
material,
is
used.
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
no
restriction
whatsoever
in
the
ohio
statutory
scheme
that
limits
the
source
of
the
corn
used
to
make
ethanol.
and
in
fact,
the
record
reveals
that
one
ohio
producer
used
as
much
indiana
corn
as
ohio
corn
in
producing
it.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
and
i
suggest
the
same
reasons
point
to
the
necessity
for
having
a
national
market
in
ethanol.
it's
simply
a
matter
of
things
such
as
economies
of
scale.
if
a
producer
is
going
to
be
limited
to
the
market
it
can
distribute
its
product,
it's
simply
not
going
to
get
to
the
level
where
it
can
compete
with
the
major
gas
producers
of
the
country.
the
ohio
scheme
has
not
caused
any
impact
on
the
flow
of
ethanol
from
indiana
due
to
any
prohibition
or
to
any
regulation
on
the
way
or
method
by
which
it
can
come
into
ohio.
the
impact
on
the
flow
if
any
ethanol
from
new
energy
is
due
to
ohio
making
it
more
lucrative
for
ohio
motor
vehicle
fuelers
to
use
that
fuel
because
they
get
a
credit
if
they
use
fuel
that's
produced
in
ohio
or
in
any
other
state
that
grants
a
similar
credit.
this
is
not
the
type
of
state
action
which
this
court
has
ever
held
the
commerce
clause
was
intended
to
prohibit.
in
fact,
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
private
market
forces.
it
simply
exerts
a
market
force
to
encourage
or
give
an
incentive
to
motor
vehicle
fuel
dealers
upon
whom
the
tax
is
applied
and
to
whom
the
credit
is
given.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
stevens,
perhaps
the
major
distinction
is
that
there
was
no
purpose
other
than
simply
to
protect
local
industry
in
that
case.
in
this
situation,
i
submit
that
the
record
demonstrates
that
there
is
a
legitimate
purpose
for
the
statutory
scheme
involved.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
i
believe
it's
the
health
environment
purpose.
i
think
it's
also
the
resulting
effects
that
encouragement
of
ethanol
has
on
the
corn
market
and
in
our
attempts
to
reduce
our
dependency
on
foreign
oil.
and
i
would
point
out
that's
another
reason
why
we
allow
an
exemption
for
coal-fired
plants,
rather
than
gas-fired
plants
because
we're
looking
for
alternative
sources
of
energy.
one
of
the
fast
depleting
sources
is
gas.
if
we
allow
the
credit
for
plants
that
use
gas,
it
simply
defeats
the
purpose.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
stated
that
you
actually
need
an
alternative
purpose
other
than
to
protect
the
local
businesses.
in
alexandria
scrap,
it
seemed
to
be
accepted
by
the
court
that
the
amendment
that
resulted
in
favoring
maryland
processors
and
in
reducing
the
flow
of
hulks
into
maryland
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
maryland
processors.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
kennedy,
the
majority
in
alexandria
scrap
found
that
the
record
in
that
case
did
not
establish
that
the
market
in
that
scrap
processing
did
not
exist.
justice
stevens
in
his
concurring
opinion
so
found
but
the
majority
found
that
the
record
simply
wasn't
sufficient.
i
would
suggest
in
this
case
the
record
is
replete
with
evidence
that
shows
that
the
ethanol
market
in
ohio
would
not
exist
without
the
state
subsidy.
it
simply
could
not
compete
with
gasoline
in
the
naturally
functioning
market
without
the
state
subsidy.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
white,
gasohol
or
ethanol
from,
other
states
cannot
compete
with
gasoline
either
without
subsidies,
and
again,
that
goes
back
to
what
i
submit
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
reciprocity
provision.
we're
looking
to
have
a
national
market
which
we
believe
is
essential
for
the
future
of
the
ethanol
industry.
if
all
the
states,
or
if
a
number
of
the
states
choose
not
to
provide
ethanol
credits,
the
ethanol
industry
will
not
survive,
at
least
at
no
significant
level
in
those
states.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
white,
it's
because
of
the
method
by
which
that
encouragement
is
taken.
we
are
encouraging
those
states
to
enact
similar
credits
so
that
ethanol
will
be
used
in
those
states
and
so
that
there
will
be
a
national
market
for
ethanol
which
will
be
beneficial
to
the
entire
industry.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
that's
correct,
justice
white.
i
don't
think
it
will
affect--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--for
the
purposes
of--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--justice
white,
that
goes
part
of
the
way,
i
believe.
and
i
think
to
follow
out
that
thought,
the
more
ethanol
use
you
have
in
the
country,
it
even
further
advances
that
purpose.
and
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
reciprocity.
it's
not
simply
to
keep
out...
it's
not
because
indiana
ethanol
is
any
less
effective.
it's
to
encourage
indiana
and
other
states
to
grant
ethanol
credits
so
that
the
national
ethanol
market
will
grow
and
so
that
all
states
will
use
the
environmentally
benign
product
so
that
the
environment
of
the
nation,
which
will
affect
all
ohio
citizens
plus
citizens
of
the
nation
will
be
benefitted.
along
the
lines
of
the
questioning
as
to
where
this
court
is
going
with
the
market
participant
theory,
i
think
perhaps
a
comment
in
a
footnote
of
the
reeves
case
by
the
majority
points
out
where
the
limits
might
ultimately
be.
in
footnote
10,
the
court
noted
that
marketplace
actions
involving
integral
operations
in
traditional
areas
of
governmental
functions
may
not
be
subject
even
to
congressional
regulation
pursuant
to
the
commerce
power.
and
it
went
on
to
state
that
it
follows
easily
that
the
intrinsic
limits
of
the
commerce
clause
do
not
prohibit
state
marketplace
conduct
if
it
falls
within
this
sphere.
to
me
that
suggests
that
what
the
court
is
thinking
is
that
if
you're
dealing
with
a
legitimate
state
purpose
in
your
overall
statutory
scheme,
you
are
not
subject
to
the
commerce
clause.
if
you
are
not
subject
to
the
commerce
clause,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
or
not
portions
of
that
scheme
may
have
an
effect
on
the
flow
of
commerce.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
stevens,
perhaps
the
distinguishing
fact
in
dean
milk
was
that
it
in
effect
barred,
completely
barred
a
product
from
coming
into
a
marketplace
unless
it
complied
with
the
statute.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
bar
to
ethanol
coming
into
ohio
from
any
state.
any
producer
may
sell
its
ethanol
in
ohio
if
it
can
sell
it
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
stevens,
the
record
doesn't
indicate
it
because
this
case
was
filed
before
the
statute
went
into
effect,
but
i
would
not
dispute
that
it
is
very
likely
that
they
sell
little
or
no
ethanol.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
stevens,
i
think
it's
different.
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
a
statute
intended
to
encourage
something
that
puts
an
economic
incentive--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--justice
stevens,
if
in
dean
milk,
the
ordinance
said,
you
will
do
it
within
five
miles
of
the
city,
i
believe,
or
in
a
plant
in
another
area
which
has
the
same
requirements,
i
think
that
would
have
passed
the
constitutional
test.
i
think
that's
what
ohio
does.
it
says,
you
shall
use
ohio
ethanol
or
you
shall
use
ethanol
which
is
produced
in
a
state
which
has
similar
credits.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
and
i
think
that's
a
matter
for
the
legislature
to
determine
as
to
the
wisdom
of
its
course
of
action,
and
whether
it
believes
it
will
effect
that
result.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
in
any
of
those
cases,
this
court
struck
down
a
scheme
such
as
the
one
at
issue
here.
in
great
a&p
tea
company
and
in
sporhase,
the
reciprocity
provisions
themselves
were
not
the
subject
of
a
per
se
rule
of
invalidity,
it
was
the
effect
of
those
reciprocity
provisions
which
was
to
impose
an
absolute
ban
on
the
sale
or
distribution
or
movement
of
a
matter
or
a
product
in
interstate
commerce.
i'd
point
out
that
in
great
a&p
tea
company,
this
court
also
recognized
that
the
purported
purpose
by
the
state
of
mississippi
bordered
on
the
frivolous.
but
in
any
event,
i
would
submit
that
what
the
cases
stand
for
is
that
you
cannot
impose
an
absolute
ban
on
the
movement
of
goods
in
commerce.
neither
of
those
cases,
by
the
way,
dealt
with
a
tax
subsidy
or
a
straight
subsidy
program.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
this
court
has
distinguished
for
purposes
of
determining
which
type
of
commerce
clause
test
to
apply
whether
it
subjected
it
to
a
regular
balancing
test
or
whether
it
subjected
it
to
a
stricter
scrutiny
test,
such
as
was
used
in
the
a&p
case.
i
would
submit
that
baldwin
was
in
fact
not
a
reciprocity
provision,
to
my
understanding.
they
simply
precluded
the
movement
of
those
goods
without
any
ability
for
other
states
to
allow
that
movement
by
granting
reciprocity.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
no,
justice
scalia,
it
would
not
be
limited
to
ethanol.
i
think--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--i
think
what
it
would
be
limited
to
is
whether
or
not
they
had
a
legitimate
purpose
that
was
carried
out
other
than
simply
to
protect
their
local
businesses.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
i
assume
i
would
believe
that
this
court
would
not
allow
that
broad
a
prohibition,
of
an
absolute
prohibition.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
the
second
issue
that
was
discussed
in
the
alexandria
case,
but
was
not
decided
because
the
majority
of
the
court
felt
there
was
not
an
adequate
record
upon
which
to
determine
it,
was
whether
or
not
the
commerce
clause
forbids
state
action
affecting
a
flow
of
commerce
that
is
dependent
for
its
existence
on
state
subsidies
rather
than
on
private
market
forces.
the
majority
noted
in
a
footnote
that
if
the
facts
had
so
shown,
it
would
have
hesitated
to
find
that
the
commerce
clause
did
in
fact
prohibit
such
action.
concurring
opinion
by
justice
stevens
indicated
that
that
justice
felt
that
the
commerce
clause
did
not
prohibit
such
state
action.
i
think
the
reasoning
in
both
that
footnote
and
in
justice
stevens'
concurring
opinion
supports
that
thought.
the
commerce
clause
only
prohibits
state
action
which
affects
the
operation
of
a
free
market
or
a
natural
functioning
of
the
private
marketplace.
if
there
is
no
naturally
functioning
private
marketplace,
how
can
any
burden
that
is
imposed
upon
such
a
flow
involve
the
commerce
clause?
it
simply
doesn't
interfere
with
a
subject
that
the
commerce
clause
was
intended
to
cover.
while
the
record
in
alexandria
scrap
might
not
have
been
sufficient
for
the
court
to
determine
that
issue,
the
record
in
this
case
is
replete
with
evidence
that
the
ethanol
market
would
not
exist
at
its
present
level
or
at
any
significant
level
in
ohio,
absent
the
state
credit
that's
granted
by
this
scheme.
thank
you,
your
honor.
