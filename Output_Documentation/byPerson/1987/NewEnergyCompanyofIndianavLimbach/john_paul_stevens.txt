justice
stevens
when
under
your
view
of
it
did
ohio
enter
the
market,
in
1981
or
1984?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
there
a
difference
in
alexandria
scrap
the
hulks
that
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
were
all
located
in
maryland,
weren't
they?
the
procedure
generally
was
to
get
rid
of
these
hulks
that
were
in
the
state?
and
it
didn't
really
matter
whether
it
was
an
out-of-state
wrecking
company
or
an
in-state
wrecking
company
that
bought
them
as
long
as
the
hulk
was
in
maryland.
but
here
your
interest
is
in
having
the
gasohol
that
is
consumed
in
ohio
be
less
contaminated
than
regular
gas,
and
it
is
immaterial
where
the
gas
comes
from
as
long
as
you
have
an
environmental
interest.
you'd
get
the
same
benefit
if
indiana
gasohol
were
used
in
ohio.
justice
stevens
but
what
does
ohio
care
about
whether
ethanol's
used
in
those
states.
if
the
ethanol
produced
in
those
states
is
consumed
on
ohio,
that's
what
ohio
cares
about,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
in
indiana?
they're
concerned
about
the
clean
air
in
indiana?
justice
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
this
theory?
justice
stevens
you
seriously
think
the
'84
amendment
actually
would
encourage
industry
as
a
whole
rather
than
discourage
it?
justice
stevens
it
certainly
wouldn't
help
it
any
in
indiana.
justice
stevens
well,
maybe
indiana
has
a
better
way
of
doing
it.
what
if
every
state
were
to
adopt
the
indiana
program
of
subsidizing
the
industry?
justice
stevens
why
is
one
better
than
the
other?
justice
stevens
well,
what
do
you
say
to
your
opponent's
argument
that
maybe
the
indiana
gasohol
that
no
longer
comes
into
ohio
has
been
replaced
by
lead
gas
rather
than
gasohol?
justice
stevens
that's
possible.
justice
stevens
general
farrin,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
hawaiian
tax
case
on
these
exotic
beverages
they
had
over
there,
the
tax
credit
for
those
local--
justice
stevens
if
you
state
it
that
broadly,
i
guess
the
dean
milk
case
was
incorrectly
decided.
because
there
certainly
was
a
legitimate
health
purpose
in
their
regulation.
justice
stevens
how
much
indiana
ethanol
is
sold
in
ohio
when
you
have
this
particular
situation?
there
isn't
any,
is
there?
justice
stevens
none
at
all.
it's
the
equivalent
of
an
absolute
bar.
justice
stevens
well,
but
maybe
madison,
wisconsin,
because
if
we
really
want
to
encourage
everybody
else
in
the
country
to
have
the
same
strict
health
regulations
we
have,
too,
the
best
way
to
do
it
is
to
have
everybody
adopt
this
kind
of
protectionist
ordinance
that
no
milk
can
be
shipped--
justice
stevens
--not
other
ethanol,
but
meets
the
same
physical
requirements
and
health
standards
and
all
the
rest
but
just
that
it's
produced
in
states
that
adopt
the
same
public
policies
of
how
to
subsidize
the
industry
that
we
think
are
the
wisest.
justice
stevens
it
would
be
the
same
purpose
you
have
in
this
case,
to
encourage
other
states
to
adopt
this
kind
of
an
ethanol
policy.
justice
stevens
you
could
perhaps
tax
all
imports
from
indiana
unless
indiana
adopted
this
type
of
tax
credit.
justice
stevens
no,
i
don't
think
it
would,
either,
but
i
think
your
theory
would.
