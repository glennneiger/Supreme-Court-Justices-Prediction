justice
white
well,
how
about
gasohol
from
other
states?
justice
white
well,
how
does
keeping
out
a
seller
from
another
state
that
doesn't
grant
reciprocity,
that
doesn't
grant
ohio
people
a
credit
there,
how
does
keeping
them
out
serve
the
health's
interest
of
ohio?
justice
white
well,
here's
an
outsider
that
wants
to,
that
apparently
has
enough
product
to
sell
in
ohio.
and
if
he
can't
come
in,
why
his
share
of
the
market's
going
to
be
taken
up
by
another
ethanol
producer,
either
an
ohio
one
or
a
foreign
one,
or
by
gasoline.
justice
white
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
where
the
ethanol
comes
from?
justice
white
looks
to
me
like
the
more
sellers
of
ethanol
you've
got
in
ohio,
the
more
service
to
your
health's
interest
you'd
have.
