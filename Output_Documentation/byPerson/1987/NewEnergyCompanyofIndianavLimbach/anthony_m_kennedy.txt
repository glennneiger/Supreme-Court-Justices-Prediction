justice
kennedy
do
we
have
cases
which
say
that
it's
improper
to
try
to
influence
the
policies
of
other
states'?
justice
kennedy
so
the
objective
itself
is
legitimate
to
try
to
influence
the
policy
of
other
states?
justice
kennedy
i
thought
dean
used
the
reasonable
alternative
analysis,
it
said
whether
there's
a
reasonable
alternative.
justice
kennedy
well,
it's
purpose
is
to
insist
that
other
states
do
it
ohio's
way,
isn't
it?
justice
kennedy
but
it
did
so
in
a
way
that
penalized
producers
from
one
state
and
not
others,
and
incidentally
helped
ohio
producers.
justice
kennedy
well,
it
didn't
hurt
ohio
producers,
did
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
there,
the
state
was
actually
buying
the
hulks.
are
you
saying
the
state
enters
the
market
any
time
it
imposes
a
tax?
justice
kennedy
is
there
anything
in
our
precedents
which
says
that
one
state
can
take
action
to
influence
the
conduct
and
the
policies
of
other
states?
i
thought
that's
what
the
commerce
clause
was
all
about.
justice
kennedy
but
that
was
because
maryland
created
a
market
that
had
not
previously
existed.
and
this
is
a
market
that
exists
quite
without
regard
to
the
intervention
of
the
state
of
ohio.
