justice
scalia
mr.
schwartz,
i'm
not
sure
you'd
really
hold
to
that
line.
in
the
subsidy
situation
you
were
just
addressing,
it's
assumed
that
the
subsidy
goes
to
the
producer,
no
matter
where
the
producer
sells
it.
suppose
you
had
a
state
subsidy
that
applied
to
an
in-state
producer
but
only
if
he
sells
those
products
within
the
state,
and
he
forgoes
that
subsidy
to
the
extent
he
ships
out
of
the
state,
would
you
say,
well,
that's
not
a
tax
so
it's
all
right?
justice
scalia
you
would.
justice
scalia
as
long
as
it's
not
a
tax,
you
can
do
whatever
you
like
to--
justice
scalia
--so
i
can
subsidize
an
in-state
produce
but
only
if
he
ships
nothing
out
of
state
and
as
soon
as
he
ships
out
of
state,
he
looses
the
subsidy
and
that
doesn't
interfere
with
the
commerce
clause?
justice
scalia
mr.
schwartz,
before
you
go
on
to
the
new
argument,
will
you
tell
me
why
this
is
different
from
what
we
have
clearly
allowed
that
is
facially
discriminatory
and
that
is
the
assessment
by
a
state
of
a
compensating
use
tax.
in
that
situation,
the
state
is
just
equilibrating
matters
between
itself
and
other
states.
it's
worried
that
its
sellers
will
be
at
a
disadvantage
because
of
its
tax
if
other
states
don't
impose
taxes
so
it
imposes
a
use
tax
on
any
imports.
it
seems
to
me
the
state
here
is
doing
the
same
thing.
it's
worried
that
its
sellers
will
be
at
a
disadvantage
abroad,
viz
a
viz,
the
sellers
in
the
state
that
does
not
give
the
same
credit
that
it
does.
so
it's
just
making
things
even.
justice
scalia
right.
and
they're
tax
cases.
justice
scalia
mr.
farrin,
do
you
really
think
it
solves
matters
to
simply
say
it's
the
application
of
a
state
subsidy?
i
assume,
for
example,
that
a
state
could
if
it
chooses
subsidize
all
of
its
domestic
industries
in
a
lot
of
ways,
by
tax
credits,
or
even
by
giving
them
money.
but
do
you
think
a
state
could
subsidize
domestic
production
by
only
charging
a
sales
tax
on
out-of-state
products
and
not
charging
a
sales
tax
on
in-state
products.
and
saying,
well,
that's
all
fine
because
all
we're
doing
is
subsidizing
in-state
industry
which
is
certainly
a
laudable
and
valid
goal?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
ask
either
of
those
questions.
i
asked
whether
you
thought
that
would
be
constitutional
simply
because
it's
the
application
of
a
state
subsidy?
justice
scalia
so
subsidy
isn't
the
answer.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
necessarily
prove
that
this
is
okay.
justice
scalia
general
farrin,
do
these
subsidy
laws
tend
to
predominate
in
those
states
that
have
a
lot
of
air
or
those
states
that
have
a
lot
of
corn?
i
mean,
do
you
really
think
that
that's
what's
going
on
here?
justice
scalia
they
are
corn
growing,
aren't
they?
justice
scalia
there
is
a
national
market
in
corn,
of
course.
you
can
take
it
from
anywhere
and
the
national
market's
going
to
help
your
domestic
corn.
justice
scalia
do
you
think
that
ohio
could
impose
a
penny
tax
on
all
gasoline
from
states
that
don't
subsidize
ethanol?
i
mean,
if
it's,
you
know,
the
national
scheme
is
in
its
interest,
why
does
it
have
to
limit
its
incentives
to
ethanol?
why
can't
it
start
fiddling
with
other
imports
into
the
state,
subsidize
some
of
them
and
tax
others
in
order
to
induce
other
states
to
subsidize
ethanol?
is
there
anything
in
the
nature
of
your
theory
that
would
require
ohio
to
limit
itself
to
ethanol
as
a
device
to
get
other
states
to
go
along?
justice
scalia
that's
scary,
isn't
it?
