justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
fawer,
fisher
specifically
made
reference
to
the
collective
entity
rule,
and
i
thought
in
a
way
which
indicated
an
attempt
to
preserve
it.
the
government
says
to
us
that
it
may
not
make
evidentiary
use
of
the
fact
that
a
particular
individual
within
the
corporation
performed
the
physical
act
of
production.
if
that's
true,
i
don't
see
how
you
should
be
concerned
about
any
testimonial
aspect;
the
government
says
it
has
a
right
to
use
the
corporation's
act
of
production
to
incriminate
the
individual;
but
not
to
use
the
fact
that
a
particular
individual
responded
to
the
subpoena.
so
why
do
you
have
a
problem?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
use
of
the
corporations
is
a
legal
fiction--
justice
o'connor
--and
this
is
a
result
of
that.
