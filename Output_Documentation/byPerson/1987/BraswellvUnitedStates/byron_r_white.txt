justice
white
i
would
suppose
your
position
would
apply
to
any
corporation...
or
to
any
person
who
is
the
custodian
of
the
corporate
records
of
anybody?
justice
white
of
any
corporation?
justice
white
so
it's
the
one-man
corporation
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
white
well,
let
me...
your
client
was
forced
to
produce
these
records?
justice
white
and
if
he
hadn't...
and
if
he
hadn't
produced
them,
but
a
third
person
had,
the
fact
that
they
were
corporate
records
and
had
been
authenticated,
could
be
used
against
him?
justice
white
if
he
hadn't
produced
them;
if
somebody
else
had?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
all
the...
authentication
does
is
to
authenticate
the
fact
that
they
are
corporate
records?
justice
white
well,
he
isn't
any
worse
off
if
he
has
to
authenticate
them.
all
that's
been
authenticated
is
that
these
are
corporate
records.
justice
white
these
are
corporate
records?
justice
white
well,
you're
going
to
be
using
the
fact
that
these
are
corporate
records
against
him?
justice
white
the
problem
really
is
that
the
contents
of
these
records
may
be
very
incriminating.
justice
white
well,
not
until
they're
authenticated.
justice
white
but
until
they're
properly
authenticated
by
somebody
the
records
are
not
admissible
against
him
at
all.
justice
white
contents
or
otherwise,
they
have
to
be
authenticated.
justice
white
yes,
but--
justice
white
so
to
the
extent
that
the
act
of
production
amounts
to
authentication,
it
may
not
be
used
against
him.
they're
going
to
have
to
authenticate
by
some
other
way.
justice
white
in
a
corporation,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
subpoena
had
run
against
the
corporation?
justice
white
and
the
corporation
sent
up
a
representative
and
the
representative
said,
"this
is
going
to
violate
my
fifth
amendment?
"
justice
white
well,
he's
a
custodian.
justice
white
well,
you
subpoenaed
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
says,
"well,
anybody
that
we
send
up
has
a
fifth
amendment
claim.
"
justice
white
oh?
but
anybody
they
send
up
will?
justice
white
well,
if
they
send
up
somebody...
what
if,
in
response
to
this
subpoena
a
man
arrives...
a
hooded
man
arrives
with
a
mask
on?
and
no
name
or
anything
else?
and
he
says,
"here
are
the
corporate
records.
"
"the
corporation
has
sent
me
up
to
deliver
these
records
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
"
justice
white
sure.
justice
white
are
they
authenticated?
justice
white
the
corporation
has
sent
up
the
records.
and
everybody
agrees
that
the
corporation
did
it.
they
set
up
their
records.
justice
white
how
can
they
use
it?
how
can
they
use
it
if
they
subpoena
mr.
braswell,
and
he
brings
up...
he
just
comes
and
delivers
the
records?
he's
just
responding
to
a
subpoena;
he
isn't
testifying.
justice
white
all
right,
but
that's
all
he's
done.
now
how's
the
government
going
to
use
those
records?
they're
going
to
come
into
court
and
say,
"these
are
the
corporate
records"?
justice
white
i
thought
you
said
that
the
act
of
production
may
authenticate
the
records?
justice
white
well,
there
was
a
response
to
the
subpoena...
there
was
a
response
to
the
subpoena
that
the
corporation
sent
its
records
up
in
the
response
to
the
subpoena.
that's
exactly
right.
that's
the
testimony
we
can
put
on.
can
you
use
that
to
show
that
he
knew
of
the
documents?
justice
white
of
course
in
most
cases,
i
suppose,
you
could
always
just
subpoena
the
corporation?
justice
white
all
right,
suppose
you
subpoena
a
small
corporation
and
you
just
get
no
response?
justice
white
and
then
what
are
you
going
to
do?
justice
white
on
behalf
of
the
corporation?
justice
white
i
thought
it
was
only
the
act
of
production
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
we're
not
talking
about
testimony
on
the
stand?
justice
white
you
never--
--no,
we're
talking
about
authentication,
though,
aren't
we?
we're
at
least--
--by
the
act
of
production.
--that.
by
the
act
of
production?
justice
white
and
we're
talking
also
about
the
fact--
--you're
not
saying
anything
about
being
on
the
witness
stand.
we're
talking
also
about
the
fact
that
he
obviously
knows
of
the
existence
of
the
document
if
he
produces
them,
aren't
we?
what
if
he
brings
a
whole--
justice
white
they
deny
that
in
their
brief
right
here.
justice
white
the
fact
that
it
was
braswell
who
produced
them.
i
thought
they
say
they
couldn't
use
them.
