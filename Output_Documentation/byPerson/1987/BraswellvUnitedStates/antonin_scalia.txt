justice
scalia
now,
wait.
if
he's
the
only
one
or
not.
all
your
rule
would
exclude
is
showing
that
he
knew
of
it
from
the
fact
of
his
production
of
it.
justice
scalia
you
would
still
be
able
to
show
that
he
knew
of
it
in
other
fashions.
justice
scalia
does
your
grant
of
immunity
say
that
the
government
will
not
be
able
to
use
this
defendant's
production
of
the
fact
of
the
production
for
any
purpose,
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
how
do
you
verify
it?
i
mean,
you
have
to
get
some
warm
body
up
there
to
establish
that
the
corporation
produced
it;
and
who
is
going
to
say
these
are
the
corporation's
records
if
you
don't
put
braswell
up
there?
i
don't
understand
how
you
prove
it?
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
how
you
get
braswell
on
the
stand.
can't
you
claim
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
just
not
get
on
the
witness
stand?
justice
scalia
well,
if
what
you've
said
is
true,
i
don't
see
that
there
is
very
much
ground
between
you
and
the
petitioner
here.
why
are
you
so
reluctant
to
give
a
grant
of
immunity,
which
sounds
to
me
is
going
no
further
than
what
you
say
ensues
anyway
by
operation
of
law?
justice
scalia
he
wouldn't
allow
you
to
say
even
that
the
corporation
had
produced
it,
if
by
the
corporation,
you
mean
braswell.
whereas
you
would
say
you
can
go
and
say
the
corporation
had
produced
it;
show
by
process-server
that
the
corporation
responded
to
the
process
in
this
way?
he
would
not
allow
that?
justice
scalia
if
these
were
private
records,
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
them
by
a
subpoena,
right?
if
he
was
unincorporated?
justice
scalia
it
seems
very
strange,
doesn't
it?
don't
you
think
that
seems
strange?
justice
scalia
so
the
fifth
amendment
is
essentially...
your
argument
reads
"not
simply
shall
be...
nor
simply
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
"
there's
really
a
gloss
on
it;
"nor
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
as
a
witness
against
himself,
except
when
he
is
testifying
in
his
capacity
as
an
agent
of
a
corporation?
"
justice
scalia
but
that's
essentially
what
your
doctrine
comes
down
to,
right?
he
can't
testify
against
himself
when
he's
acting
as
a
secretary
of
the
corporation.
justice
scalia
well,
braswell
is
not
a
corporate
entity
and
he
doesn't
want
to
testify
against
himself.
justice
scalia
he's
perfectly
content
to
let
them
do
it
if
they
can
do
it
through
some
other
agent.
he
just
doesn't
want
them
to
do
it
through
him.
could
you
tell
me
once
more
why
the
government
is
unwilling
to
grant
use
immunity
just
to
the
extent
of
the
authentication...
production
and
authentication
of
the
records?
in
the
typical
case?
justice
scalia
but
that's
perfectly
all
right
when
it's
his
diary
you're
trying
to
get.
you
just
say,
"well,
gee,
i
guess
we
just
can't
get
the
diary.
"
and
it's
also
perfectly
all
right
if
he
hasn't
incorporated.
you
just
shrug
your
shoulders
and
say,
"well,
that's
what
the
fifth
amendment
says:
we
can't
make
this
guy
turn
it
over.
"
"we
have
to
find
some
other
way
to
get
it.
"
but
here,
when
it's
a
corporation...
certainly
the
larger
the
corporation
is,
the
less
likely
this
problem
is
to
arise,
isn't
it?
for
general
motors,
it's
no
real
problem.
justice
scalia
well,
on
that
basis,
it
wouldn't
do
any
good
to
subpoena
him.
he'd
just
say...
he
would
just
wouldn't
produce
them.
you
don't
know
that
they're
there.
nobody
knows
it.
justice
scalia
why
don't
you
call
him
to
the
stand
on
behalf
of
the
corporation:
you
know,
just
have
the
bailiff
say,
"call
to
the
stand
the
president
of
braswell
corporation.
"
+
and
you
put
him
under
oath,
"
do
you
swear
to
tell
the
truth?
you're
not
cross-examining
braswell;
you're
cross-examining
the
president
of
braswell
corporation.
justice
scalia
it
didn't
work,
did
it?
justice
scalia
why
is
that
a
rational
line,
i
mean...
if
you
think
that
people
have
this
bifurcated
personality:
there
is
braswell
the
person
and
braswell
the
corporation?
justice
scalia
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
strike
me
as
a
very
effective
provision.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
designed
to
allow
the
government
to
get
effectively
all
the
information
it
needs.
i
mean,
you
may,
to
be
effective,
need
to
have
the
testimony
of
the
individual,
too.
and
what
the
fifth
amendment
says,
is
"that's
too
bad".
justice
scalia
--what
if
he
brings
a
whole
batch
of
documents;
a
whole
batch
of
sets
of
corporate
records
and
he
just
plunks
them
down
and
he
says,
"among
these
is
the
response
to
your
subpoena?
"
justice
scalia
it's
not
much
use
for
authentication,
is
it?
