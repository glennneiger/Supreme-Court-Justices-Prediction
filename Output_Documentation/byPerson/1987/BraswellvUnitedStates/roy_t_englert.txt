mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
does
involve
corporate
documents,
not
the
documents
of
an
individual
or
a
sole
proprietorship.
the
law,
with
respect
to
corporate
documents,
has
been
settled
for
more
than
75
years.
not
only
hale
v.
henkel
in
1906,
but
more
important
for
our
purposes,
the
wilson
and
dreier
cases,
decided
in
1911,
made
it
clear
that
an
individual
may
not
interpose
his
personal
fifth
amendment
privilege
as
a
basis
for
resisting
a
subpoena
for
corporate
documents.
that
holding
has
been
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
case
after
case
in
succeeding
years.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
has
so-stated
regularly.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we're
willing
to
submit
the
case
to
this
court
on
that
assumption.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes
and
no.
that's
what
page
34
of
your
brief
says:
"yes
and
no".
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
all
right:
i
think
justice
white's
rather
colorful
hypothetical
is
helpful
in
understanding
the
difference
between
what
we
say
cannot
be
used,
and
what
we
say
can
be
used.
the
corporation
produces
these
records;
we
are
entitled,
and
we
think
this
court's
case
is
quite
clear
that
we
are
entitled,
to
make
evidentiary
use
of
the
fact
that
worldwide
purchasing
corporation;
and
worldwide
machinery
corporation
produced
these
records,
for
whatever
evidentiary
significance
that
may
have
for
authentication
or
anything
else,
we
can
use
that
fact.
what
we
can't
do
is
say
"not
only
did
worldwide
corporation...
worldwide
purchasing
and
worldwide
machinery
produced
these
records;
but
randy
braswell
was
the
person
who
handed
them
over.
"
now
it
may
be
that
we
can
infer
on
that
basis--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it's
not
an
immunity
question,
your
honor.
it
flows,
we
think,
logically--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--we
think
it
flows
logically
from
the
rationale
of
the
white
case
decided
in
1944,
a
rationale
that's
been
reiterated
many
times.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if
he
objects
to
the
evidence
that
it
was
randy
braswell
who
personally
produced
the
records,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
a
fifth
amendment
privilege,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
it's
simply
a
question
of
holding
the
government
to
the
underlying
theory
on
which
it
gets
these
documents.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
for
the
underlying
theory,
i
cite
primarily
the
white
case
decided
in
1944.
well,
since
it's
quoted
at
pages
21-22
of
our
brief,
that's
a
passage
that
was
repeated
in
the
curcio
case;
in
the
bellis
case;
it's
the
underlying
theory,
your
honor...
the
individual
acts
as
agent
of
the
corporation,
and
not
as
an
individual
when
he
produces
the
documents...
that's
what
the
court
has
said
over
and
over.
and
to
the
extent
we're
conceding
anything,
we're
conceding
what
we
think
is
the
logical
consequence
of
that
underlying
theory.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
phrase
it
that
way,
no.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if
the
government
at
trial
asked
the
question,
"isn't
it
true,
mr.
process-server,
that
randy
braswell
was
the
man
who
handed
you
these
documents?
"
and
defense
counsel
objected,
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
sustain
that
objection.
it's
a
ground
derived
from
this
court's
fifth
amendment
decisions,
to
be
sure,
but
it's
simply,
justice
white,
it's
simply
holding
the
government
to
the
underlying
theory
that
this
court--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
best
i
can
do
is
to
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
quotation
on
pages
21
and
22
of
our
brief
from
the
white
case.
in
that
case,
the
court
said,
"individuals
acting
as
a
representative
of
a
collective
group
cannot
be
said
to
be
exercising
their
personal
rights
and
duties;
nor
to
be
entitled
to
their
purely
personal
privileges,
et
cetera,
in
their
official
capacity
where
they
have
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
"
the
point
of
that
passage--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
this
is
considerably
less
than
constructive
immunity.
constructive
immunity
would
mean
that
we
couldn't
use
the
act
of
production...
anyone's
act
of
production;
the
corporation's
act
of
production.
what
we're
conceding
is
something
much
more
limited.
we
want
to
use
the
corporation's
act
of
for
whatever
it's
worth.
we
think
we're
entitled
to
it.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i
must
respectfully
disagree.
i
simply
don't
think
it's
the
same
thing
as
immunity.
i
think
it's
like
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
said
the
violations
of
the
fifth
amendment
can't
be
exploited.
it's
something
that
flows
from
the
underlying
doctrine.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no
case,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we
think
it
flows
logically.
if
we're
mistaken,
i'm
sure
the
court
will
tell
us
so.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
again,
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
we
can
use
against
braswell
the
fact
that
worldwide
purchasing
and
worldwide
machinery--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
fact
that
he
personally
produced
the
documents,
the
answer,
i
believe,
is
"no".
i
believe--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--on
the
theory
that--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
again,
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
the
theory
is
that
it
is
not
randy
braswell
who
performed
that
act
of
production;
that
it
is
the
corporation
that
performed
that
act
of
production.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
process
server
can
verify
that.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
sure.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
of
course,
this
is
a
grand
jury
matter,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct.
if,
in
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
he
were
on
the
witness
stand,
we
might
well
be
able
to
ask
those
questions.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
process-server,
certainly.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
to
the
extent
that's
a
fair
inference
from
the
fact
that
the
corporation
produced
the
records,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
as
long
as
what
the
process-server
says
is
only
that
the
corporation
produced
them.
that
is
the
typical
situation,
justice
kennedy,
in
which
this
court
has
addressed
the
precise
question
whether
we
can
compel
an
individual
to
produce
these
documents.
in
part
of
the
bellis
opinion,
i
believe
it
was
in
a
footnote,
the
court,
responding
to
justice
douglas'
dissent,
said
"justice
douglas
says
this
is
the
target.
"
"that's
typical.
"
"it
is
the
usual
situation
in
which
the
documents
are
subpoenaed
from
a
target
of
the
investigation.
"
he
may
or
may
not
end
up
a
defendant,
but
there
is
obviously
some
contemplation
that
he
may
end
up
a
defendant,
and
the
longstanding
doctrine
is
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
those
records.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
justice
scalia,
i
think
there's
a
world
of
difference
between
our
position
and
the
petitioner's
position.
i
think
mr.
fawer
would
not
agree
with
me
that
we
could
use
the
corporation's
act
of
production
and
any
fair
inferences
therefrom
against
randy
braswell.
he
would
want
randy
braswell
to
turn
over
these
documents
and
then
have
complete
immunity
from
our
taking
any
inferences
from
the
testimonial
content,
if
any,
of
that
act
of
production.
and
that
can
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
how
i
understand
his
position.
justice
kennedy
also
mentioned
the
problem
of
constructive
use
in
that
i
understand
the
petitioner's
position,
they
would
want
us
to
be
required
to
give
constructive
use
immunity.
i'm
sorry,
not
constructive
use
immunity...
statutory
use
immunity,
before
we
could
get
these
documents.
a
long
line
of
cases
has
allowed
us
to
get
documents
like
these
without
statutory
use
immunity
and
we
think
the
court
should
reaffirm
those
cases.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if
he
was
a
sole-proprietorship,
for
example;
and
he
made
an
adequate
showing
of
self-incrimination,
then
we
would
have
to
grant
statutory
use
immunity
to
get
them;
that
is
the
doe
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
made
the
argument
in
doe
that
that
was
strange;
that
we
should
be
able
to
get
those
records
as
easily
as
corporate
documents,
and
the
court
rejected
it.
there
really
has
been
a
bright
line
drawn
by
the
court's
cases.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we're
submitting
this
case
on
the
assumption...
not
the
concession...
but
the
assumption,
that
there
could
be
a
testimonial
incident
to
this
act
of
production,
as
the
court
held
there
was
in
doe.
we
think
we
win
this
case
anyway.
the
lower
courts
said
we
win
this
case
anyway.
bellis
and
fisher
and
curcio
and
wilson
and
dreier,
all
say
we
win
this
case
anyway,
in
my
view.
that
is
what
the
court
has
said,
is
that,
notwithstanding--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
doctrine
turns
on
the
lack
of
testimonial
compulsion.
the
doctrine,
again,
as
we
understand
it,
was
best
stated
in
the
white
case,
not
saying
that
the
individual...
not
saying
that
there
is
no
act
of
compulsion;
not
saying
that
there
is
no
testimony;
saying
that
individuals,
when
they
act
as
corporate
agents,
are
not
exercising
their
personal
rights.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way,
your
honor.
a
corporation--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--one
could
put
it
that
way,
but
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
corporations
are
fictional
entities.
somebody...
we
know
from
hale
v.
henkel
that
a
corporation--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
but
he
wants
worldwide
purchasing
corporation
and
worldwide
machinery
corporation
to
not
testify
against
him
by
their
act
of
producing
documents.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we're
unwilling
to
do
that,
your
honor,
because
in
some
cases
at
least,
there
are
components
to
the
act
of
production
that
are
very
important
to
us
that
we
want
to
use
against
the
individual,
not
necessarily
that
randy
braswell
produced
the
documents;
but
that
the
corporation
had
possession
and
control
of
these
documents;
that
they
are
the
corporate
records.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well
your
honor,
that's
very
problematic.
it
really
is.
in
small
corporations,
often
the
targets
will
be
the
only
people
who
know
where
the
records
are.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
the
problem.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
the
problem.
we
can
try
to
hold
the
corporation
in
contempt;
which
may
or
may
not
work;
they
can
always
just
disband
the
corporation;
which
would
make
it
awfully
hard
to
hold
it
in
contempt.
we
could
try
to
hold
the
individual
in
contempt
for
not
cooperating;
but
of
course,
his
response,
if
petitioner
prevailed
in
this
case,
would
be,
"well,
i
was
just
exercising
my
fifth
amendment
rights.
"
"i
don't
have
any
duty
to
participate
in
this.
"
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
i
can't
agree
completely
with
that.
let's
suppose,
just
as
an
hypothetical
example,
that
the
president
of
general
motors,
and
the
president
of
chrysler
agree
to
engage
in
price
fixing.
they
would
surely
keep
any
documentation
of
that
to
a
minimum
and
keep
it
under
lock
and
key...
keep
it
secret
from
the
rest
of
the
corporation.
if
we
issued
a
subpoena
to
general
motors:
"please
give
us
all
records
that
document
discussions
of
prices
with
chrysler
corporation.
"
i
don't
think
the
president
would
give
up
those
records.
he
knows
we
can't
prove
that
they
exist
if
we
don't
get
them.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
at
least
we
have
the
threat
of
contempt
against
him,
your
honor,
in
that
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
as
to
any
corporate
records
you
may
ever
be
asked
to
produce?
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
the
court
has
gone
that
far
many
times.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
and
if
your
honor
will
indulge
me,
i'd
just
like
to
read
a
couple
of
things
this
court
said
in
the
curcio
case,
a
case
primarily
relied
on
by
my
opponents,
to
see
just
whether
the
court
has
said
that.
their
quote
in
page
17
of
our
brief
at
the
bottom
of
page
24,
"the
court
said
that
the
books
and
records
of
corporations
cannot
be
insulated
from
reasonable
demands
of
governmental
authorities
by
a
claim
of
personal
privilege
on
the
part
of
their
custodian.
"
on
the
next
page
we
quote
the
passage
from
page
128
of
the
curcio
decision,
"a
compulsory
production...
a
corporate
or
association
records,
by
their
custodian,
is
readily
justifiable,
even
though
the
custodian
protests
against
it
for
personal
reasons.
"
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
again,
if
the
concession
is
unwise,
i'm
sure
the
court
will
tell
us
so.
but
we
do
think
the
concession
flows
logically
from
the
underlying
agency
rationale
of
the
doctrine,
that
the
individual,
although
waiver
is
one
doctrine
that's
been
invoked,
all
of
the
undesirability
of
a
de
facto
privilege
for
the
corporation
has
also
been
invoked,
out
of
practical
necessity,
has
been
invoked...
the
court
has,
we
think
primarily
rested
on
the
agency
rationale
that
in
individual
simply
is
not
acting
as
an
individual
when
he
produces
documents.
corporations
have
to
act
through
human
beings.
that's
what
was
pointed
out
by
the
court
in
the
opinion
in
bellis.
and
it
is
because
corporations
have
to
act
through
human
beings,
that
we
have
to
use
what
is
admittedly
a
fiction;
that
randy
braswell
is
not
"randy
braswell"
when
he
produces--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
would
have
constituted
technical
compliance.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
because
the
problems
of
who,
within
corporations
can
actually
lay
his
hands
on
documents?
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
justice
stevens,
if
that
actually
happened,
i
think
the
government
would
shout
"hurrah".
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
sure
and
we
regularly
accept
that.
i
was
only
trying
to
respond
to
your
question.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
there
is
a
problem
with
subpoenaing
documents
from
one
individual--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--from
one
corporate
officer
who
may
know
of
documents
that
are
squirreled
away
somewhere;
and
as
a
ploy,
has
somebody
else
respond,
and
truthfully
respond
that
he's
made
a
diligent
search
of
every
place
in
the
corporation
where
he
knows
that--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
there
we
do
run
into
the
curcio
case.
we
want
the
right
to
issue
the
subpoena
to
the
individual.
we
want
the
right
to
make
that
individual
comply
with
the
subpoena.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
on
behalf
of
the
corporation,
we
have
that
right
under
prior
cases.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
tried
that
in
1957.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
didn't
work.
the
court
drew
the
line.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
as
i
read
the
curcio
case,
in
which
we
were
trying
to
make
the
argument
that
that
was
not
a
rational
line
and
the
court
disagreed
with
us,
there
are
pragmatic
concerns
at
work
in
this
area.
everything
flows
from
hale
v.
henkel;
everything
flows
from
the
fact
that
mr.
fawer
admitted
many
times,
that
we
have
a
right
to
these
records.
the
agency
rationale
that
has
built
up...
the
other
underlying
rationales,
which
are
reiterated
throughout
the
opinion
in
the
bellis
case,
all
flow
from
the
fact
that
we
have
to
be
able
to
effectively
get
these
documents.
that
has
been
the
court's
concern
in
case
after
case,
is
making
the
government's
power
to
get
these
documents
effective.
the
government,
if
you
will,
got
"piggy"
in
the
curcio
case,
it
didn't
try
to
make
it's
power
to
get
the
documents
effective;
it
tried
to
put
somebody
on
the
stand,
before
the
grand
jury
and
disclosure
the
contents
of
his
own
mind,
and
the
court
put
its
foot
down.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
constitutional
doctrines
often
impede
government
effectiveness;
limitations
on
constitutional
doctrines
regularly
aid
government
effectiveness.
it's
a
pragmatic
world
out
there;
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
its
cases.
and
that,
i
think,
is
what
is
going
on
in
the
curcio
case
and
in
the
various
other
cases
in
which
the
court
has
reiterated
this
well-established
doctrine.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
that's
of
course,
very
significant,
justice
marshall.
that's
very
significant,
because
it
serves
to--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
i'm
sorry
about
that,
but
the
point
is,
that
we're
not
seeking
to
get
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
the
way
the
government
tried
to
get
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
in
curcio.
we're
trying
to
get
these
documents;
we're
trying
to
make
sure
that
we
can
get
these
documents
in
an
effective
way,
and
our
underlying
worry
in
these
cases,
and
the
underlying
worry
that
the
court
has
recognized,
is
that
just
addressing
a
subpoena
to
a
corporation
isn't
an
effective
way.
again,
the
argument
to
which
there
is
force...
we'll
admit
that.
that
there's
nothing
different
about
making
the
person
act
as
agent
when
he
produces
documents,
and
making
the
person
act
as
agent
before
the
grand
jury,
has
force;
but
it's
one
that
this
court
has
rejected.
the
court
rejected
it
in
curcio
when
we
advanced
that
argument,
because
of
pragmatic
concerns.
those
pragmatic
concerns
always
had
a
place
in
the
development
of
the
doctrine
in
this
area;
and
we
think
properly
so.
a
long
line
of
very
distinguished
justices
have
signed
on
to
all
these
opinions...
in
1911;
in
1923;
in
1944;
in
1957;
in
1974.
it's
those
decisions
that
we
think
conclusively
settle
the
issue
in
the
government's
favor.
and
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reaffirm
those
decisions
once
again.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
might
say
on
that
subject,
mr.
fawer
i
think
may
have
misspoken.
he
said
"no
one
has
disputed
that
the
act
of
production
would
be
incriminatory
in
this
case.
"
that's
not
true.
we
dispute
that.
but
as
i
said
to
justice
kennedy,
for
purposes
of
submission
to
this
court,
we're
happy
to
have
the
court
assume
that
there
would
be
incrimination
in
this
case,
because
we
think
the
issue
is,
"does
that
matter"?
and
we
think
the
decisions
of
the
court
say
it
doesn't.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
fisher
case
indicated
a
fairly
narrow
scope,
i
think,
for
this
act
of
production
doctrine.
the
claim
of
privilege
was
defeated
in
that
case.
and
i
think
much
of
the
underlying
logic
of
fisher
applies
here,
especially
in
light
of
what
i
understand
to
be
a
concession
by
mr.
fawer
that
we
could
authenticate
these
records
though
an
accountant
or
through
other
means
than
the
act
of
production.
of
course,
that
would
be
an
issue
to
be
addressed
by
the
courts
below.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
that
both
can
be
incriminating.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
on
those
facts
alone,
no.
but
it
could
be
with
some
additional
facts.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
to
justice
kennedy,
although
with
the
same
kinds
of
limitations
i've
given
in
previous
answers.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
a
typical
response
and
we
get
that
we
delighted.
