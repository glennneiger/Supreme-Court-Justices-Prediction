chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
fawer.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
distinction
has
been
recognized
since
the
time
of
hale
v.
henkel,
hasn't
it,
in
1906.
the
court
said
it
is
a
distinction
of
constitutional
significance.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
your
claim
here
is
that,
by
the
act
of
producing
the
records,
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
who
produced
them
and
not
someone
else
would
have
had
a
tendency
to
incriminate
him?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
asking
us
to
overrule
a
case
that's
some
80
years
old,
and
i'm
interested
in
just
what
sort
of
incriminating...
to
get
into
how
a
corporate
custodian
of
a
one-man
corporation
would
incriminate
himself
by
producing,
or
simply
authenticating
corporate
records?
chief
justice
rehnquist
hale
v.
henkel;
wilson
in
1911;
white
in
1943--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--i'm
not
so
much
interested
in
the
hypothesis;
that
is,
the
introduction
of
my
question
itself;
and
that
is,
how
in
this
case,
does
a
corporate
custodian
incriminate
himself
by
simply
authenticating
corporate
records?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
he
might
incriminate
himself
because
he's
lying
about
whether
those
are
all
the
corporate
records--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--that
would
be
a
defense
to
anyone
responding
to
a
subpoena:
i
may
incriminate
myself
because
i
may
not
be
producing
everything
the
subpoena
calls
for.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
would
be
an
astounding
doctrine.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
are,
in
a
sense.
because
doe
would
cover
your
case
if
this
weren't
a
corporation.
at
least
i
take
it
that
is
what
you
say.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
court
has
in
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
has
always
drawn
a
line
between
an
individual
and
a
corporation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
does
the
government's
concession
that
it
cannot
use
it,
in
sum,
why
does
that
fall
short
in
your
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
one-man
corporation,
how
are
you
going
to
get
anybody
to
produce
records
if
this
doctrine
is
applied?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
then,
maybe
doe
was
wrong?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you
can't
explain...
i'm
only
one
of
nine,
but
if
you
can't
explain
how
a
corporation...
how
a
one-man
corporation's
documents
can
be
subpoenaed
and
authenticated
under
this
doctrine,
you
know,
and
i
daresay,
you'll
lose
more
than
one
person.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
know
that
he
didn't
even
look
at
the
records.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fawer.
we
will
now
hear
from
you,
mr
elglert.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that...
i
don't
really
see
your
point.
it's...
how
is
the
government
held
to
its
underlying
theory
by
doing
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
case
from
this
court...
you've
just
cited
us
to
this
language
from
white
and
now
i've
read
it
over
again.
it
seems
to
me
it
says,
the
individual
producing
records
may
incriminate
himself
personally,
but
if
it's
corporate
records,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
i
mean,
that's
in
favor
of
the
government;
not
against
it.
you're
saying
something,
the
government
has
to
concede.
what
case
is
it
from
this
court
that
requires
that
concession
by
the
government?
what
specific
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
then,
why
do
you
concede
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
he
a
defendant
in
this
action?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
what
if
he
decides,
"i'm
not
going
to
testify",
he
says,
"under
the
fifth
amendment".
then
how
do
you
authenticate?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
the
question
becomes
incrimination
in
this
case,
the
government
won't
fare
well,
i
suspect,
because,
you
know,
you
don't
have
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
it
will
incriminate.
if
there's
a
colorable
claim
of
incrimination
under
our
cases,
the
court
has
to
sustain
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
mr.
fawer,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
you
disagree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fawer.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
case
is
braswell
against
the
united
states,
no.
87-3.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner,
randy
brasswell
is
the
president
and
sole
stockholder
of
two
mississippi
corporations.
a
federal
grand
jury
issued
a
subpoena
to
him
in
his
capacity
as
president,
requiring
him
to
produce
the
records
of
these
corporations.
the
district
court
denied
brasswell's
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
holding
that
the
collective
entity
doctrine
illegal
--
and
a
legal
principle
developed
in
our
earlier
decisions
prevented
petitioner
from
claiming
that
the
act
of
producing
these
records
was
protected
by
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
this
question
because
there
was
a
conflict
between
two
different
courts
of
appeals
on
this
point.
for
the
reason
set
forth
and
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
holding
that
the
custodian
of
corporate
records
may
not
resist
the
subpoena
for
such
records
on
the
ground
that
the
act
of
production
will
incriminate
him
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan,
marshall
and
scalia
have
joined.
