justice
kennedy
i
take
it
that
part
of
the
immunity
you
would
want
is
that
it
is
unlawful
for
the
government
to
use
the
act
of
production
to
show
that
he
knew
the
documents
existed?
justice
kennedy
so
in
the
case
of
any
corporation,
the
officer
who
produces
the
documents,
under
your
rule,
cannot
be
charged
with
knowledge
of
their
existence
in
any
prosecution?
justice
kennedy
but
knowledge
of
the
documents
is
highly
relevant
in
most
criminal
prosecutions,
we
know
that.
justice
kennedy
and
that
would
apply
to
general
motors,
because
some
officers
may
have
confidential
knowledge
of
a
very
secret
transaction,
and
the
only
people
that
know
about
the
transaction
are
the
ones
that
are
producing
the
documents,
and
your
rule
would
require
immunity
from
the
use
of
the
production
of
the
documents
to
show
they
knew
they
existed.
justice
kennedy
that's
your
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
kennedy
is
that
true
even
if
production
of
the
documents
would
incriminate
the
person
in
a
trial
against
that
person
without
reference
to
the
corporation?
justice
kennedy
so
that
you
are
willing
to
try
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
braswell
might
well
incriminate
himself
by
reference
to
the
knowledge
or
the
existence
of
the
documents?
justice
kennedy
and
you
can
use
the
fact
that
he
produced
these
documents
against
him
to
prove
those
matters?
justice
kennedy
and
i
can't
understand
it.
justice
kennedy
what
is
it
that
prevents
you
from
using
that?
you
haven't
given
him
statutory
immunity.
justice
kennedy
you're
saying
you
can't
use
it.
why
can't
you
use
it,
what
protection
can
you
offer
to
braswell's
counsel
that
you
will
not
introduce
that
fact?
justice
kennedy
you
mean
you're
telling
us
that
if
mr.
braswell's
attorney
in
a
subsequent
prosecution
objects
to
this
evidence,
that
it
will
be...
the
objection
must
be
sustained?
justice
kennedy
so
that
he
does
have
the
fifth
amendment
privilege?
justice
kennedy
what
kind
of
privilege
is
it,
then?
justice
kennedy
what
case
do
you
cite
for
that
proposition?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear:
you
are
conceding
that
he
does
have
a
privilege
against
his
own
incrimination;
and
you
are
conceding
that
these
documents
may
not
be
used
against
him
for
that
purpose?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
protection
does
he
have?
justice
kennedy
but
this
is
the
constructive
immunity
doctrine
that
we
declined
to
adopt
in
doe.
justice
kennedy
but
you
haven't
followed
the
statutory
procedures
for
immunity.
that's
an
extra
statutory
immunity
that
you're
now
offering
us...
or
offering
braswell.
justice
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
it
flows
logically
because
braswell
has
a
privilege.
suppose
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not
braswell
has
ever
seen
the
invoice?
"mr.
braswell,
have
you
ever
seen
this
invoice?
"
can
he
decline
to
answer
that?
or
can
you
use
the
fact
that
he
produced
the
documents
against
him;
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
kennedy
no.
you
stick
with
my
hypothetical:
"mr.
braswell,
have
you
seen
this
document?
"
"are
you
aware
of
its
existence?
"
"have
you
ever
seen
it
before?
"
can
you
use
the
fact
that
he
produced
that
document
to
impeach
him
in
the
answer
to
that
question?
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
kennedy
but
on
what
theory?
justice
kennedy
that
he
has
a
fifth
amendment
privilege:
that
must
be
your
only
theory.
justice
kennedy
suppose
he's
on
trial,
and
the
question
is
whether
he
knew
of
the
documents?
can
you
use
that?
can
you
introduce
the
process-server?
justice
kennedy
well,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
testimonial
incident
to
the
production,
isn't
it?
in
some
cases
their
testimony
incidents
that
are
relevant
and
others
that
are
not.
justice
kennedy
but
if
that's
true,
then
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
would
be
there
is
no
testimonial
compulsion
when
a
private
person
is
forced
to
produce
the
documents?
justice
kennedy
would
you
want
us
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that,
by
becoming
an
officer
in
a
corporation,
you
simply
waive
your
fifth
amendment
rights
as
to
anything
you
might
ever
be
asked
to
produce?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
so
you
think
the
law
is
that
braswell
has
no
fifth
amendment
rights
because
he
formed
a
corporation,
as
to
any
documents
he
might
be
asked
to
produce
as
a
corporate
officer,
even
though
there
may
be
some
testimonial
incidents
to
that
production?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
that's
true,
then
to
go
back
to
the
beginning,
i
don't
understand
why
you
make
the
concession
that
you
do
on
page
34
that
for
some
purposes
you
cant'
use
the
information?
