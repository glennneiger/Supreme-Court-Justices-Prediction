justice
stevens
--maybe
only
the
representatives
of
corporations
know
which
ones
they
are
and
can
pick
out
the
one
who
needs
the
immunity
best.
and
how
does
the
government
know
before
they
see
the
documents?
justice
stevens
and
in
this
case,
you
talk
about
alternates,
why
couldn't
your
client
have
designated
somebody
else
to
produce
the
documents
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
and
gotten
the
same
protection?
justice
stevens
shouldn't
the
government
have
accepted
that?
justice
stevens
well,
but
say
he
hired
his
lawyer
and
his
lawyer
produced
the
documents,
says,
"i
represent
the
corporation;
i
made
the
search
commanded
by
the
subpoena;
and
here
are
the
documents.
"
why
wouldn't
that
protect
your
client?
justice
stevens
you
mean
you
assume
the
attorney
would
not
act
in
his
proper--
justice
stevens
--well--
justice
stevens
--i
don't
buy
that.
i
think
i
presume
lawyers
act
as
professionals.
they're
not
going
to
run
around
violating
their
client's
confidences.
justice
stevens
maybe
the
accountant
doesn't
have
authority
to
produce
them
if
he's--
justice
stevens
--no,
no,
no.
see,
what
i'm
saying,
they're
subpoenaing
the
records.
what
if
the
accountant
doesn't
have
custody
of
the
records?
justice
stevens
with
immunity?
justice
stevens
oh,
oh,
oh.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
you're
assuming
he's
going
to
be
indicted,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
put
him
on
the
witness
stand
if
he
doesn't
voluntarily
go
on
the
witness
stand,
he
waives
his
fifth
amendment
privileges.
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
at
this
point?
your
subpoena
was
addressed
to
"randy
braswell,
president",
then
the
name
of
the
corporation.
the
subpoena
was
served
on
him
in
his
capacity
as
a
corporate
officer
rather
than
as
an
individual,
is
that
correct?
justice
stevens
would
it
have
been
in
compliance
with
the
subpoena
for
the
secretary
of
the
corporation
to
have
brought
the
documents
to
court
and
got
on
the
witness
stand
and
said,
"i've
made
a
diligent
search
of
the
documents,
and
i
speak
on
behalf
of
the
corporation,
these
are
what
you
subpoenaed?
"
justice
stevens
why
not?
if
basically
you're
saying
that
he
is
merely
an
agent
of
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
has
responded
through
a
different,
duly-authorized
agent,
who
is
willing
to
testify
under
oath
that
everything
commanded
by
the
subpoena
has
been
produced.
why
wouldn't
that
be
in
compliance
with
the
subpoena?
justice
stevens
well,
he's
prepared
to
testify
that
he
had
the
authority.
he's
the
custodian.
it's
not
often
true
that
the
president
is
the
actual
custodian
of
corporate
documents.
usually
it's
the
secretary.
justice
stevens
well,
it
happens
all
the
time,
i
mean,
i
think
often,
very
often,
corporations
respond
to
subpoenas
by
bringing
in
some
officer
other
than
the
particular
one
that
was
designated
in
the
subpoena.
justice
stevens
and
i'm
really
asking
whether
you
have
a
duty
to
accept
that?
justice
stevens
but
he's
not
an
individual
under
your
submission.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
is
you
want
to
be
able
to
ask
the
individual
whether
he
has
in
fact
disclosed
everything
he
knows
about
the
corporate
documents?
that's
asking
an
individual
rather
than
an
officer
of
the
corporation
when
you
put
it
that
way.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
before
you
sit
down?
in
the
doe
case,
as
i
remember,
there
was
a
district
court
finding
that
the
act
of
production
would
have
been
incriminating,
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
it.
there's
a
two
court
finding
and
in
this
court
basically
we
accept
those
findings.
were
there
any
similar
findings
either
way
by
the
district
court
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
question,
if
i
may?
there
are
two
ways
in
which
the
act
of
production
might
be
incriminated:
one
is
just
the
fact
of
the
act
of
producing;
secondly,
by
what
the
producing
representative
of
the
corporation
says
when
he
gets
on
the
witness
stand:
"yes,
i
made
a
diligent
search.
"
and
so
forth.
do
you
contend...
concede
that
both
of
those
are
equally
incriminating?
both
aspects
of
the
act
of
production?
you
don't
concede
it
either.
justice
stevens
you
concede
just
the
mere
physical
act
of
delivering
the
documents
can
be
incriminating,
even
if
he
took
them
in
the
office;
says,
as
a
note
that,
as
justice
marshall
called
your
attention
to,
say
you
just
delivered
the
documents;
just
dumped
them
off
in
the
process-server's
office;
and
left
them.
didn't
sign
anything
or
no
receipt.
would
that
be
incriminating
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
you're
saying
if
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
it,
then
when
randy
braswell
tells
his
lawyer
or
other
agent
to
produce
the
document,
he
is
testifying
against
himself?
