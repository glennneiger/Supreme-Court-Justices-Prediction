mr.
michael
s.
fawer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case,
stated
simply,
is
whether
the
principal
of
a
one-man
corporation,
simply
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
his
status
as
its
records
custodian,
can
be
compelled
to
make
self-incriminatory,
tacitly
testimonial
disclosures;
or
is
he,
like
the
custodian
in
u.s.
v.
doe,
to
be
afforded
the
limited
act
of
production
privilege
secured
to
all
natural
persons
under
the
fifth
amendment?
the
facts
of
the
case
are
quite
simple:
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
began
a
grand
jury
investigation,
criminal
tax
investigation,
of
randy
braswell.
he
was
the
target
of
that
investigation,
and
there
is
no
issue
as
to
that.
in
august
1986,
during
the
course
of
that
investigation,
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
was
served
upon
mr.
braswell
as
president
of
his
corporation,
of
the
one-man
corporation
that
he
has
called
worldwide
purchasing.
it
was
a
broad-based
subpoena
virtually
identical
to
the
one
that
is
before
your
honors
in
u.s.
v.
doe.
it
is
found
at
pages
6
and
7
ver
batem
in
our
joint
appendix.
in
response,
we
filed
a
motion
to
quash,
asserting
our
act
of
production
privilege.
the
government
opposed,
stating
that
no
corporate
custodian
has
any
act
of
production
privilege;
with
that
issue
joined,
there
was
a
brief
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
court
in
that
district,
and
the
court
found
that
mr.
braswell
did,
in
fact,
conduct
his
business
as
close
to
a
sole-proprietorship,
as
one
could
see.
nevertheless
the
court
held,
as
the
government
had
contended,
that
the
act
of
production
was
not
available
to
any
corporate
custodian
under
the
fifth
amendment;
and
that
they
relied
on
the
case,
the
lincoln
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
which
so-held.
we,
at
that
time
refused
to
produce
before
the
grand
jury...
we
had
a
contempt
citation
against
us;
there
was
a
stay
of
the
commitment
under
the
contempt
citation;
and
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
same
grounds
as
had
the
ruling
of
the
d.c.
circuit...
a
d.c.
court,
excuse
me.
they
did,
of
course,
note
in
that
context
that
there
was
a
split
in
the
circuits
as
to
whether
or
not
the
bellis
decision
of
this
court
was
limited
to
the
contents
of
records
of
a
corporation;
as
opposed
to
the
testimonial...
the
tacitly
testimonial
aspects
of
the
act
of
production.
our
position
is
quite
simple.
we
feel
that
we
are
entitled...
that
mr.
braswell
is
entitled
to
the
same
production
with
respect
to
his
records,
the
corporate
records,
as
is
the
records
custodian
in
doe.
the
only
distinction
between
the
two
is
braswell,
inc.
chose
to
do
business
under
the
corporate
framework.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
it
is
true,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say,
as
this
court
has
said
on...
at
least,
i
believe
this
court
has
said,
that
they
were
addressing
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
contents
of
corporate
records,
as
opposed
to
the
testimonial
aspects
of
the
fifth
amendment,
were
in
fact
to
be
privileged?
we
do
not
dispute,
nor
did
we
dispute
below,
that
the
government
has
an
absolute
right
to
the
contents
of
the
records
of
mr.
braswell's
corporation.
we
do
not
in
any
way
deny
that,
nor
do
we
think
it
would
be
proper.
that
proposition
has
been
established
at
least
as
early
as
hale
right
through
the
bellis
decision.
and
i
believe
fisher
and
doe
do
nothing
to
undercut
it.
our
position
is
simply
that,
as
to
anything
testimonial,
of
whatever
nature
it
may
be;
whatever
form
it
may
take,
this
court
has
always
protected
that
type
of
disclosure.
and
mr.
braswell,
although
he
is
a
representative
of
corporation,
is
at
the
same
time
a
person
of
flesh-and-blood,
and
he
has
the
right
with
respect
to
his
testimony
to
claim
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
that
is
exactly
our
position.
to
put
it
another
way--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
we
happened
to
be
a
one-man
corporation;
and
in
fact,
below
we
candidly
made
the
argument
that
a
one-man
corporation
should
not
under
the
doctrine
of
bellis
and--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--yes.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
yes,
in
fact--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--yes,
if
he
was
not
involved
in
any
way
in
making
those
records
available.
and
they
had
somebody...
if
the
records,
for
example
were...
if
they
had
issued
that--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--other
people
could
authenticate...
well,
theoretically,
could
authenticate
corporate
records.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--yes.
but
we
are
not...
i
don't
think
the
court
should
look
to
whether
or
not
the
test
under
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
whether
or
not
the
government
to
have
an
independent
means
of
being
able
to
do
it
here
to
prove
this
fact;
in
this
instance,
if
you
make
him
produce,
then
he
will
be
using
his
tacit
admission
against
him.
and
that
this
court
has
always
condemned.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
we're
going
to
be
using
the
fact
that
he
produced
a
particular
record.
we
don't
know
which
record
this
would
apply
to,
because
in
the
court
below,
we
did
not
have
a
hearing
on
the
particular
applicability
of
the
act
of
production
doctrine
in
this
case.
because
once
the
government...
excuse
me,
judge
barber
ruled
that
it
was
not
available
to
a
corporate
custodian,
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
we
have
asserted,
and
nobody
has
denied,
that
we
are...
we
would
be,
incriminated
by
the
production
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
two
points
on
that,
your
honor.
i
must...
just
might
first
point
out...
i
assume
the
case
you
are
referring
to
is
hale
v.
henkel,
when
you
said
a
case
that
is--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--but
it
is
important
to
note
when
you
look
at
hale
that
technically
what
was
done
in
hale--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--when
randy...
if
randy
braswell...
the
direct
response
to
your
question
is,
if
randy
braswell
didn't
bring
in
records,
when
he
turns
those
records
over
he
is
representing
these
are
the
records
that
you've
asked
for.
that
is
in
itself
a
representation
which
has
testimonial
implications:
he
has...
this
man
has
no
financial
records
other
than
the
corporate
records.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
that's
one
possibility.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
that's
true.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
well,
i
don't
know.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
everybody...
the
only
individual
that
i
know
of
right
now
where
there
is
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
an
act...
there
is
an
exception,
with
respect
to
the
act
of
production
privilege,
is
the
corporate
custodian.
the
inferences
that
can
flow,
in
a
tax
court
case
particularly,
from
the
fact
that
you
possess
certain
records;
that
you
don't
produce
all
the
records;
or
that
you
have
possession...
or
that
certain
records
do
or
do
not
exist;
are
the
kind
of
facts
that
are
used
every
day
in
a
tax
court
prosecution.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
how
would
the...
excuse
me.
your
honor?
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
very
simply.
the
way
you
get
records
any
time
there
is
a
privilege
raised:
you
immunize,
statutorily
immunize
the
man
who
has
the
privilege.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
why
you're
immunized,
remember--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
because
the
fifth
amendment
protects
him
from
not
incriminating
himself
testimonially.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
if
that
is
to
whom
the
subpoena--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--you
still
get
the
records.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
you
can
get
somebody
else.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
somebody
else
in
the
corporation
who
would
not--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
in
this
corporation,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
anybody
else.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
but
the
same
is
true
in
doe.
the
exact
same
question
would
be
raised
by
your
honor
in
doe.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
general
motors--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
if
you
use
the
direct--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--yes.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
if
you
think--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--so
we
understand...
you
have
a
right
to
those
records;
the
government
has
a
right
to
the
contents
of
those
records.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
you
can
get
them
in
two
ways:
you
can
get
them
either
by
immunizing...
that
narrow
immunization
as
to
the
testimonial
implications
of
the
production
on
the
person
you
served
your
subpoena
on;
if
that's
who
you
insist
produces
them,
or
you
find
somebody
else
who
does
not
have
such
a
claim.
and
you
analyze
it.
in
the
doe
case,
it
wasn't
a
corporation.
one
man
happened
to
have
a
larger
business
entity
than
does
randy
braswell.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
excuse
me?
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
the
point,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
we're
talking
about,
in
fifth
amendment
protection,
it
is
not
limited
to
solely
someone
who
has
a
sole
proprietorship.
i
would
think
that
someone
like
randy
braswell
would
be
of
interest
to
your
honor
in
the
sense
that
he
has
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
with
respect
to
any
kind
of
testimony,
no
matter
what
type
it
may
be.
and
we
all
acknowledge...
i
think
this
court
has
acknowledged
clearly
in
doe;
in
fisher;
in
curcio;
and
you
would
go
back
into
any...
way
before
that...
that
the
cases
make
clear
that
testimonial,
tacit
testimonial
admission
is
protected
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
the
only
real
question
here
is
why
should
we
not
afford
that
same
privilege
to
someone
who
happens
to
be
doing
business
or
holding
corporate
records.
that's
all.
that's
the
very
narrow
focus
here.
and
what
we're
saying
is,
if
you
don't
afford
randy
braswell
the
privilege,
then
you
are
going
to
deny
him
the
right
to
say,
"i
shouldn't
have
to
incriminate
myself
by
producing
these
records.
"
and
we
are
not
asking
in
any
way,
in
any
doctrine
or
revision
of
what
the
court
has
done.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
it
has
always
drawn
that
line,
but
i
believe,
i
think
it
was
justice
brennan
has
indicated
in
a
number
of
cases,
the
line
was
always
drawn
with
respect
to
access
to
contents,
not
testimony.
the
line
was
drawn
because
of
what
boyd
had
to
say,
and
the
unhappiness
of
the
court
over
the
past
century
of
boyd's
protection...
potential
protection,
of
contents.
and
then
everything...
the
collective
entity
doctrine
was
a
response
to
the
contents,
the
privacy
rationale
underlying
boyd.
from
hale
to
bellis,
that's
what
you
have:
consistent
attacks;
or
a
consistent
doctrine
that
says,
"if
it's
corporate,
we
are
not
going
to
protect
the
contents.
"
"the
government
has
a
right
to
them.
"
what
fisher
and
doe,
but
basically
fisher,
does,
it
says,
"the
nature
of
the
entity
makes
no
difference.
"
we
are
not
going
to
protect
the
contents
of
business
records
at
any
rate.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
i
have
a
problem
because
i
think
that
what
the
government
is
asking
you
to
do
is
to
engage
in
a
pure
fiction.
we
have
no
problem
that
in
a--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--truly.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
but
i
do
not
know
why
this
court
should
want
to
be
party
to
using
a
patent
fiction
to
deny
a
natural
person
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
now
why
do
i
say
it's
a
fiction?
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
we
suggest
to
your
honor,
they
may
be.
but
we
have
no
right
to
hide
behind
those
contents.
you
have
a
right
to...
i
say,
the
government
has
a
right
to
those
contents.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
that
is
part
of
it,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
he
cannot
be
charged
with
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
document,
but
what
the
document
contains
can
be
used
against
him.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
authenticated
by
him
or
someone
else?
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
yes,
it
is.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
my
rule--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--if
he
is
the
only
person...
if
you
need
to
have
him
produce
it.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
exactly.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
exactly.
wouldn't
you?
you'd
be
able
to
show...
what
about
your
being
able
to
show
that
his
signature
was
on
it?
that
you
could
show
by
the
testimony
of
other
people
that
they
were
kept
in
his
home;
all
sorts
of
things,
right?
every
other
inference;
every
other
piece
of
direct
proof
would
be
available.
all
you
would
be
limiting
it
to,
the
only
thing
you
couldn't
do
is
from
the
mere
fact
that
this
person
had
brought
them
into
court,
that
brought
them
into
the
grand
jury,
that
fact
couldn't
be
used
against
him.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
that
is
true,
but
they're
are
very--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--someone
has
to
authenticate
them.
but
to
take
the
typical
case,
i
mean,
surely
in
general
motors,
we
really
shouldn't
be
worried
that
in
general
motors
there's
not
going
to
be
anyone
else
but
one
person
who
could
authenticate
the
documents?
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
but
in
tax
court--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--i
do
not
think--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--we
would
have
no
problem
should
all--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--the
government,
i
think,
would
have
accepted
that;
but
they
might
not
have
accepted
at
this
point.
they
have
insisted
that
he
produce.
do
i
know
whether
they
would
have
accepted
the
third
party
bringing
them
in?
i
don't
know.
but
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
if
a
third
party
were
to...
if
you
were
to
follow
that
mechanism,
you'd
still
have
to
afford
him
the
protection.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
justice
stevens,
if
i
were
mr.
braswell's
private
attorney
at
that
point,
and
some
other
lawyer,
i
would
tell
mr.
braswell
he
should
still
assert
his
privilege
and
not
rely
on
the
possibility
that
that
other
lawyer
would
assert
an
attorney-client
privilege
of
some
sort
to
protect
mr.
braswell.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
i
don't
assume
that,
but
i
don't
want
to
assume
the
contrary
either.
i
have
a
right
not
to
incriminate
myself,
and
if
the
government
can
bring
that
attorney
in,
and
if
that
attorney
decides
for
one
reason
or
another,
that
he
is
free
to
make
that
disclosure--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--then
i
have
lost.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
but
i
do
not...
i
normally...
and
do
at
this
point
make
the
same
assumption
that
your
honor
does.
but
we're
dealing
here
with
a
constitutional
privilege
of
some
magnitude
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
from
our
perspective
that
the
records
that
the
tacit
testimonial
implications
of
production
could
be
meaningful
to
putting
randy
braswell
in
jail.
that's
what's
at
stake
here.
and
because
of
that,
i'm
not
going
to
make
any
assumptions
such
as,
"if
there
is
an
attorney,
he
may
not
be
called
to
the
witness
stand
to
testify.
"
or
if
a
third
party
surrogate
should
be
appointed
by
the
court,
all
we
ask
is
that
very
narrow
ability
to
be
able
to
assert
the
fifth
amendment,
preferably
by
means
of
a
grant
of
immunity,
because
that's...
then
we
don't
have
to
rest
on
anyone's
assurances
that
they
won't
use
it.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
the
fact
of
the
act
of
production,
and
that
any
fact
or
any
inference
growing
from
the
act
of
production
cannot
be
used
against
him
in
the
court.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
absolutely.
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
it,
if
you
read
pages...
i
ask
the
court
to
carefully
read
pages
34
and
35
of
the
government's
brief.
i
don't
know.
it's
a
cross
between
alice
in
wonderland
and
kafka.
they
are
saying...
and
they
admit
they
can't
use...
they
cannot...
when
randy
brings
them
in,
if
he
should
bring
them
in...
they
could
not
go
into
court
in
the
prosecution
and
prove
that
randy
braswell
produced
them.
but
they
say,
"aha,
he
acted
in
a
representative
capacity;
and
therefore,
we
can
introduce
that
a
nameless
individual
brought
them
in...
wait,
a
nameless
individual...
because
he
acted
in
a
representative
capacity,
we
can
still
use
it
against
him
individually.
"
i
don't
understand
the
distinction.
the
potential
incriminating
aspect
of
it
is
the
same.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
i
would
make
the--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--what,
the
representative
said
that?
if
the
representative
had
a
right
for
whatever
reason
to
claim
the
fifth
amendment--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--i
have
no
problem
with
that
custodian
making
that
assertion
and
claiming
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
i
don't
think
the
corporation
can
simply
say
that.
the
corporation...
one
thing
is
clear...
the
corporation
does
not
have
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
well,
that's
for
them
to
say.
i
don't
think
a
court
should
simply
accept
a
corporation.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
and
the
government
takes
them?
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
i
have
no
problem,
because
i
cannot
see--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--no.
at
that
point?
by
whom?
i
mean
a
hooded...
some
hooded...
if
they
can
subpoena,
they
know
who
that
name
is.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
two
things:
one,
in
a
prosecution
of
the
corporation,
it
would
make
no
difference
whether...
it
would
not
affect
randy
braswell.
the
corporation
has
no
fifth
amendment
privilege.
secondly,
i
don't
see
how
that
hypothetical,
how
under
those
facts,
anything
could
be
used
testimonially
against
mr.
braswell.
i
mean,
i'd
be
happy
if
some
faceless
person
brought
them
into
court,
how
is
the
government...
what
courtroom
is
the
government
going
to
be
able
to
ask
a
judge
or
a
jury
to
infer
anything
testimonial
against
mr.
braswell?
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
but
this
court
has
always
said
that
that
is
testimony.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
no,
they're
going
to
have
the
records.
he,
they
cannot
authenticate
it
through
him.
there's
an
accountant...
the
government
happens
in
this
case
to
know
that
there
was
an
account.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
but
i...
i
assumed,
i
thought
we
were
operating
on
the
assumption
that
we
would
not...
we
were
giving
him...
we
would
assert
the
privilege
and
that
you
would
have
an
immunity
as
to
that.
if
not,
then
it
could
not
be
used
against
him.
i
thought
you
were
saying--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--your
honor,
my
position
is,
this
case
on
its
facts,
in
terms
of
its
practical
difficulties,
is
no
different
than
doe,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
i
think
doe
was
right
in
that
sense.
i
mean,
i
think
the
act
of
production--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--well,
let
me
explain
it
to
you
and
still
keep
some
rebuttal
time
at
the
same
time,
your
honor.
there
is
an
accountant
in
this
case.
it's
not
on
the
record.
i'm
representing,
as
in
almost
every
corporation,
even
a
one-man
corporation...
has
an
accountant.
randy
braswell
brings
him
in
and
he's
immunized
so
that
we
can't
use
the
act
of
production
against
him;
the
contents
can
be
used
against
him;
they
get
the
accountant
to
say,
"are
these
the
records
you
saw
during
the
years
in
question?
"
"yes,
these
are
the
records
were
shown
to
me
in
the
corporation's
office.
"
and
there's
your
authentication.
end
of
story.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
he
only
has
to
authenticate.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
no,
i'm
saying
you
subpoena
it
from
randy
braswell.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
with
immunity.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
with
immunity...
you
gave
him
the
immunity.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
look,
he
has
the
immunity,
and
he's
still
prosecuted
a
week
later;
a
month
later.
within
the
year,
he's
indicted.
he's
now
in
court
in
southern
mississippi,
and
they
called,
you
know,
cpax...
and
they
say
"cpax,
you
handled...
your
name
is
on
the
tax
returns
for
the
years
1982
through
1985;
did
you
look
at
the
general
ledger?
"
"yes".
"i
show
you
exhibit
a.
"
"is
this
the
general
ledger?
"
"yes
it
is".
your
honor,
i
submit
that
it's
authenticated.
end
of
story.
and
you
have
protected
randy
braswell,
at
least
in
terms
of
the
authentication
issue
that's
been
raised.
i
would
like
at
this
point
to
preserve
at
least
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
very
briefly,
your
honor,
thank
you.
justice
marshall,
in
response
to
one
thing
you
said,
the
government
is
not
perhaps
being
totally
candid
about
how
it
would
use
that
footnote.
they
say
and
maintain
that
no
matter
who
randy
produces
them
to,
they
can
call
that
person
to
the
stand
to
say
that
he...
that
buffer,
i
will
call
it;
that
surrogate;
got
them
from
randy
and
used
that
inference
against
him.
why
do
i
say
that's
their
inference?
because
mr.
englert
said
they
would
do
it
in
the
sealed
case,
the
case
you
took
this
issue
on
and
then
the
case
was
mooted
and
then
our
cert
petition
was
granted.
look
at
footnote
no.
20
in
the
government's
brief
in
the
sealed
case:
they
say
just
that;
that
they
feel
free
to
use
the
testimony
to
put
on
the
stand
the
surrogate;
say,
"who
did
you
get
the
records
from?
"
the
surrogate
would
say,
"randy
braswell";
they
could
use
the
testimonial
inferences
from
that
against
him.
in
addition--
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
--yes,
i
disagree...
i
think
they
should
not
be
permitted
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
well,
i
don't
know
where
they
deny
that.
i
have
yet
to
see
a
denial
in
this
brief
that
they
could
not
use
the
production
by
mr.
braswell.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
there's...
we're
going
back
to
page
34.
what
they
say
there
is
that,
if
braswell
produces,
that
he's
simply
producing
with
his
other
act,
called
"representative
capacity",
that
they
can
use
that
act
against
him
although
they
cannot
say
on
the
record
that
the
person,
the
flesh
and
blood
that
walked
in
with
the
records,
was
the...
the
content
was
randy
braswell.
i
have
tremendous
problems
understanding
why
they
can't,
except
we
all
know
why
they
can't.
it's
what
justice
kennedy
was
asking:
the
fifth
amendment
says
they
can't.
and
what
you
really
have
here,
they
are
somewhat...
it
is
an
unrealistic
approach
to
the
realities
of
what
goes
on
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
michael
s.
fawer
if
they
can
put
that
person
on
the
stand
to
say
that,
yes
they
are
doing
that.
and...
i
mean,
randy
braswell
wants
to
voluntarily
say
to
his
lawyer,
without
raising
any
privilege,
"here
the
documents
bring
them
up.
"
then
there's
nothing.
there's
been
no
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment
claim.
he
needs
to
assert
the
privilege.
randy
braswell
in
this
case
has
asserted
that
privilege.
now,
i
might
point
out
something
the
government
doesn't
point
out:
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
rule
801(d)(2)...
you
know
that
that
rule
says
that
it
is
not
hearsay
for
somebody
to
testify
in
a
representative
capacity
and
that
representative
capacity
can
be
used
against
him
in
his
individual
capacity.
how
do
we
deal
with
that?
what
does
that
do
to
the
fiction
that
the
government
wants
to
palm
off
on
the
court?
the
answer
is
simple:
statutory
immunity
in
this
case.
and
by
the
way,
it's
not
going
to...
i
don't
know
of
a
single...
the
history...
i
guess
my
time
is
up.
