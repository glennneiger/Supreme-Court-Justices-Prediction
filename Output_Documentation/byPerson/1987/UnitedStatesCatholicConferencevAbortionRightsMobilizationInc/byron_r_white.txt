justice
white
well,
the
court's
got
the
power
to
decide
its
own
jurisdiction
and
do
something
until
somebody
reverses
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
and
to
go
forward
with
the
case
until
it's
reversed,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
do
you...
what
are
you
attacking?
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
do?
justice
white
well,
they
said
something
about
jurisdiction.
justice
white
why
did
they
say
that?
justice
white
if
they
said
that,
they
would
have
to...
it
would
be
proper
for
them
to
redecide
the
merits
of
the
jurisdictional
question.
justice
white
what
would
the
court
of
appeals
have
done
if
it
had
found
there's
no
colorable
jurisdiction?
justice
white
what
if
we
agree
with
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
decided
the
jurisdictional
issue
straight
out,
would
we
just
remand
and
let
them
decide
jurisdiction?
justice
white
but
it
would
save
us
a
lot
of
work.
justice
white
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
saying
there
was
a
colorable
jurisdiction?
justice
white
i
suppose
the
government
made
all
these
arguments?
did
you
participate
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
but
i
thought
the
distinction
was
that
the
criminal
contempt
citation
could
stand
and
the
civil
could
not,
which
seems
to
me
to
cut
against
you
in
this
case.
there
is
a
fine
here,
is
there,
that's
been
imposed
as
part
of
the
contempt?
justice
white
this
contempt
judgment
was
appealable?
justice
white
it's
appealable
and
in
the
process
of
appealing
it,
you
may
consider
jurisdiction.
justice
white
but
you
agree
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
decided
no
colorable
jurisdiction,
they
would
have
reversed...
they
would
have
set
aside
the
discovery
orders?
justice
white
but
if
you
decide
there
was
no
article
iii
standard,
the
district
court
was
totally
without
power.
