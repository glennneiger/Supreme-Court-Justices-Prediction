justice
stevens
mr.
baine,
how
does
that
problem
differ
than
the
problem
that
confronted
blair
in
blair
v.
united
states?
he
also
could
never
make
the
argument
if
he
couldn't
make
it
in
that
particular
proceeding.
justice
stevens
he
claimed
that
the
grand
jury
had
no
power
to
act
because
they
were
investigating
a
crime
that
was
not
authorized
by
federal
law.
the
basic
federal
law
was
unconstitutional,
but
i
don't
think
your
argument
about
blair
would
be
any
different
if
the
witness
had
said
the
grand
jury
is
improperly
constituted
or
something
like
that.
justice
stevens
well,
his
defense
was
the
grand
jury...
his
defense
was
very
similar
to
the
one
here.
the
grand
jury
had
no
power
to
ask
the
questions
that
it
wanted
to
ask.
justice
stevens
but
once
you
say
that,
you're
saying
you
can
never
make
this
argument,
and
i'm
just
saying
to
the
extent
you're
relying
on
the
fact
that
this
issue
is
never
reviewable,
that
argument
could
also
have
been
made
in
blair.
that's
kind
of
a
practical
argument
rather
than
a
legal
argument.
justice
stevens
mr.
horowitz,
can
i
give
you
a
hypothetical
that
keeps
running
through
my
mind
as
i
read
this
case?
supposing
either
congress
passed
a
statute
or
the
executive
through
regulation
decided
that
contributions
to
the
democratic
party
should
be
tax-deductible,
would
a
member
of
the...
a
republican
candidate
have
standing
to
challenge
such
a
ruling?
justice
stevens
either
the
congress
or
internal
revenue
took
that
position
by
regulation.
it
seems
to
me
your
arguments
would
compel
me
to
answer
that
question
in
the
negative,
as
i
read
your
brief,
and
i
just
want
you
to
tell
me
whether
that's
right
or
not.
justice
stevens
well,
i
would
like
an
answer
to
my
question,
if
you're
able
to
give
me
one.
justice
stevens
what
would
your
position
be
to
that?
justice
stevens
no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
they
have
decided
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
is
enforcing
a
policy
that
says
no
tax-exemption
for
contributions
to
republicans
but
a
tax-exemption
for
contributions
to
democrats.
would
a
member
of
the
republican
party
or
a
republican
candidate
have
standing
to
challenge
that?
that's
my
question.
justice
stevens
my
question
is
whether
they
would
have
standing
to
challenge
the
granting
of
an
exemption
to
the
democrats
because
they
clearly
would
not
be
eligible.
there's
no
statute,
no
regulation
that
entitles
them
to
one.
justice
stevens
possibly
not.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
we're
assuming
here
we
have
a
clearly
unconstitutional
discrimination
granting
one
group
a
preference
that
is
illegal
under
the
allegations.
i'm
not
saying
it
really
happened,--
justice
stevens
--but
don't
we
have
to
make
that
assumption?
the
question
is,
does
anybody
have
standing
to
challenge
it.
your
answer
is
no,
i
think.
justice
stevens
and
i
don't
understand
why
that's
different
to
the
democrat-republican
example,
and
maybe
you're
right.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
no,
there
is
no
statutory
basis
for
granting
either
of
them
an
exemption,
but
they
either
administratively
or
they
do
pass
a
statute
saying
democrats
shall
get
it,
but
they
don't
say
anything
about
republicans.
there's
no
basis
for
the
republicans
to
claim
it.
do
they
have
standing
to
challenge
the
benefit
for
the
democrats?
i
think
your
arguments
about
causation
and
all
would
say
that's
just
too
bad,
and
that
may
be
right,
but
i
think
we
should
face
the--
justice
stevens
mr.
baine,
would
that
make
any
difference?
supposing
they
had
been...
had
some
exemption
denied,
would
they
then
have
standing
to
challenge
the
exemption
for
the
catholic
church?
justice
stevens
would
they
have
standing
in
that
lawsuit
to
make
the
challenge
they're
making
here?
i
don't
think
so,
if
you're
right.
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
that's
not
my
question.
justice
stevens
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question?
justice
stevens
would
they
have
standing
to
make
precisely
the
same
claim
made
here?
they
can
say
we
don't
care
what
you
do
to
us,
we
want
you
to
take
away
the
exemption
for
the
catholic
church.
justice
stevens
well,
the
same
injury,
unequal
treatment.
they're
saying
you've
taken
our...
what
i'm
really
asking
you
is,
does
it
really
make
any
difference
to
your
argument
whether
they
have
had
their
own
tax-exemption
challenged
or
not.
i
don't
think
it
does.
justice
stevens
they
could
then
bring
a
lawsuit.
