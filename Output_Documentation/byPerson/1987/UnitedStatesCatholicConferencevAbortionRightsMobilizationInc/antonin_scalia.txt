justice
scalia
well,
we
could
say
that
they
can
appeal
when
the
merits,
if
the
issue
that
they're
appealing
that
pertains
to
the
sanction
that
they've
suffered,
relates
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
they
simply
have
to
wait
until
the
merits
of
that
case
have
been
disposed
of
or
are
appealed.
justice
scalia
now,
that
might
be
a
problem
where
the
sanction
hasn't
been
suspended
in
the
interim
or
where
it
can't
be
returned,
but
where
the
sanction
is
just
the
payment
of
money,
surely
you
could
say,
well,
wait
until
the
merits
of
the
appeal
either
come
up
or
are
finally
decided,
and
at
that
point,
we'll
let
you
challenge
the
sanction.
justice
scalia
i
understand,
but
at
that
point,
i'm
saying,
you
let
the
bishops
come
up
and
say
we
shouldn't
have
been
socked
with
this
fine,
and
if
it's
been
paid,
we
want
it
returned,
if
it's
been
suspended
in
the
interim,
as
it
has
here,
we
don't
have
to
pay
it.
why
wouldn't
that
give
them
full
relief?
justice
scalia
well,
i
guess
that
question
comes
down
to
whether
equal
protection
challenges
lie
where
what
you're
suing
for
is
not
to
get
treated...
not
to
have
yourself
treated
as
favorably
as
the
other
person,
but
to
have
the
other
person
treated
as
unfavorably
as
you.
are
there
any
equal
protection
cases
where
the
plaintiff
sues
not
to
get
something
for
himself,
but
to
get
something
taken
away
from
another
person?
i'm
not
aware
of
any
offhand.
usually,
the
equal
protection
plaintiff
wants
to
get
the
advantage
of
what
the
other
side
has.
justice
scalia
mr.
beil,
in
theory,
they
don't
care
about
the
dismissal
of
the
lawsuit.
they
may
be
strangers
to
the
lawsuit,
but
they're
not
strangers
to
the
contempt
citation.
that
has
come
down
upon
them.
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
court
had
imposed
criminal
contempt
instead
of
civil
contempt?
suppose
the
court
had
said,
you
know,
you
don't
give
us
the
document,
off
to
jail?
justice
scalia
now,
you
know,
we
do
have
a
thing
called
habeas
corpus.
are
you
saying
that
even
though
the
court
has
no
authority,
no
jurisdiction,
there's
no
case
of
controversy,
there
is
no
way
for
that
person
to
get
out
of
jail
until
the
lawsuit
is
completed?
justice
scalia
well,
but
that's
the
basis
that
they
want
to...
on
which
they
want
to
challenge
it.
justice
scalia
so,
even
though
you
are
perfectly
correct
that
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
and
that
is
ultimately
determined
to
be
the
case
on
appeal,
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
make
that
vindication
until
the
case
is
decided,
so
you
have
to
spend
however
many
years
it
is
in
jail
until
the
other
lawsuit
finally
concludes?
that's
the
result.
justice
scalia
why
should
we
start
off
regarding
the
matter
as
somehow
the
primary
focus
should
be
the
case
out
of
which
this
order
from
the
court
issued?
as
far
as
the
person
who
receives
an
order
from
the
court
that
says
you
do
this
or
you'll
go
to
jail
or
you
do
this
or
you'll
be
fined
so
much
a
week
as
concerned,
as
far
as
that
person
is
concerned,
there's
only
one
case.
that
is
the
order
from
the
court.
does
the
court
have
authority
to
issue
that
order?
what
difference
does
it
make
what
litigation
it
comes
out
of
it?
justice
scalia
he's
going
to
be
fined
or
he's
going
to
go
to
jail.
justice
scalia
well,
that
person
has
a
right...
has
the
power
to
get
an
immediate
appeal,
can't
he?
he
can
say
i'm
not
going
to
turn
over
the
documents.
the
court
says
you
don't
turn
over
the
documents,
judgment
against
you,
he
goes
up
immediately.
justice
scalia
now,
you
tell
me
how
the
third
party
can
get
a
judgment
immediately
when
he's
not
in
control
of
the
lawsuit.
justice
scalia
i'm
saying
when
there
is
a
subpoena
issued
to
the
party
in
the
lawsuit,
he
can,
at
great
expense,
but
he
can
get
a
determination.
he
can
take
a
default
judgment
and
appeal
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
the
default
judgment.
correct?
justice
scalia
but
the
third
party,
you're
telling
us
there
is
no
way
that
third
party
can
ever
stand
on
his
rights
and
say
i
will
not
turn
over
these
documents.
you're
not
just
saying
there's
no
appeal,
you're
saying
there's
no
right.
if
you
get
an
order
from
the
court,
that's
it.
justice
scalia
that
gives
the
taxing
and
spending
clause
considerable
scope.
you're
saying
taxing
includes
not
taxing.
is
there
anything
else
that
exists
besides
taxing
and
not
taxing?
i
mean,--
justice
scalia
--what
case
of
ours
do
you
think
comes
closest
to
supporting
that?
justice
scalia
and,
there,
the
challenge
was
to
prayer
in
public
schools.
justice
scalia
let's
assume
a
group
has
a
complaint
about
the
chaplain
corps
in
the
services,
saying
that
they
aren't
chaplains
for
some
religious
groups,
although
there
should
be.
it
seems
to
me
wouldn't
that
claim
have
to
be
brought
in
such
a
fashion
as
give
my
group
a
chaplain,
not
take
chaplains
away
from
the
other
groups.
would
it
be
conceivable
to
bring
the
case
saying
since
i
don't
have
any,
nobody
should
have
any,
take
them
away
from
everybody
else,
which
is
what
the
claim
here
is?
justice
scalia
but
on
an
equal
basis.
justice
scalia
your
problem
here
is
an
equal
basis.
you
wouldn't
mind
if
everybody
had
an
exemption
or
everybody
didn't.
it's
really
an
equal
protection
problem,
favoritism,
that
you're
complaining
about,
right?
justice
scalia
so,
you
think
a
chaplain
suit
would
lie
if
what
you
brought
suit
for
is
not
to
get
a
chaplain
for
your
group,
but
to
take
it
away
from
everybody
else's.
justice
scalia
do
you
know
any
case
like
that
where
your
complaint
is
other
people
are
favored
over
you
and
what
you
get
is
not
equal
treatment
in
the
sense
of
you
being
favored,
but,
rather,
will
disfavor
them?
justice
scalia
what
happens
in
the
selective
prosecution
case
is
that
you
get
off
just
as
everybody
else
has
gotten
off.
you
don't
mandate
that
the
attorney
general
go
off
and
prosecute
everybody
else.
right?
justice
scalia
you
always
get
the
more
favored
treatment.
