mr.
kevin
t.
baine
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
for
review
of
a
final
judgment
of
civil
contempt
against
the
two
national
organizations
of
catholic
bishops.
it
is
the
bishops'
contention
that
the
contempt
judgment
against
them
is
void
because
that
judgment,
and
the
underlying
orders,
were
beyond
the
constitutional
power
of
the
district
court.
the
facts
can
be
stated
simply.
the
respondents
brought
suit
seeking
an
order
directing
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
to
revoke
the
tax-exemption
of
the
catholic
church
in
the
united
states
on
the
ground
that
the
church
had
allegedly
engaged
in
impermissible
political
activities
in
the
area
of
abortion.
the
respondents
served
subpoena
duces
tecum
upon
the
bishops,
and
the
bishops
moved
to
quash
those
subpoenas
on
the
ground,
among
others,
that
the
court
was
without
power
to
issue
them.
without
power
because
the
plaintiffs
lacking
standing
to
bring
a
lawsuit
challenging
the
tax-exemption
of
the
church.
without
power,
in
other
words,
because
there
was
no
case
or
controversy
before
the
court.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
and
later
held
the
bishops
in
contempt
when
they
declined
to
comply
with
the
subpoenas.
in
the
district
court's
view,
the
respondents...
the
plaintiffs
had
standing
to
bring
the
suit.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
contempt
judgment
without
deciding
the
issue
of
standing.
it
held
that
a
non-party
witness
may
not
challenge
the
power
or
jurisdiction
of
a
court;
he
may
only
raise
a
limited
challenge
that
there
is
no
colorable
claim
of
jurisdiction.
in
its
present
posture
then,
this
case
presents
two
questions.
whether
a
witness
and
an
alleged
contemnor
may
challenge
the
article
iii
power
of
the
court
to
act,
and,
if
so,
whether
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
without
power
because
the
plaintiffs
lacking
standing
to
bring
the
suit.
now,
there
is
a
very
simple
and
straightforward
answer
to
the
first
question.
a
witness
who
is
subpoenaed
and
held
in
contempt
may
challenge
the
article
iii
power
of
the
court
because
that
power
is
being
invoked
against
him.
the
subpoena
and
contempt
powers
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
are
themselves
elements
of
the
article
iii
power
of
the
court.
they
don't
exist
independently.
they
are
part
of
the
judicial
power
that
is
conferred
by
article
iii,
and
as
this
court
said
in
united
states
v.
morton
salt,
the
subpoena
power
is
therefore
subject
to
the
limitations
of
article
iii.
what
that
means--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--blair
v.
united
states
is
a
case
that
concerns
the
subpoena
power
of
the
grand
jury,
and
what
the
court
held
in
that
case
is
that
one
who
is
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
cannot
object
on
the
ground
that
the
criminal
statute
that
he
believes
is
the
subject
of
the
investigation
is
unconstitutional.
that
kind
of
a
challenge
is
speculative
and
premature.
a
grand
jury's
subpoena
power,
unlike
the
subpoena
power
of
a
court
in
a
civil
case,
does
not
depend
upon
the
existence
of
a
case
or
controversy,
and,
in
fact,
in
a
case
of
the
grand
jury,
as
the
court
said
in
blair,
the
grand
jury
and
the
court
don't
even
know
whether
there's
a
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
until
the
end
of
the
investigation.
in
a
civil
case,
on
the
other
hand,
the
complaint
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
case.
one
can
determine
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
whether
there
is
jurisdiction,
whether
there
is
a
case
in
controversy.
so,
it's
our
contention
that
blair
simply
has
no
relevance
to
this
case,
and,
in
fact,
when
blair
says
that
the
witness
may
not
challenge
the
jurisdiction,
it
is
referring
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
court
to
investigate,
and
to
bring
a
case
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
if
it
finds
that
a
violation
has
occurred.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
there's
no
question
that
the
burden
in
this
case
was
substantial
and
we
certainly
rely
upon
that
fact.
however,
the
contention
is
that
the
court
has
no
power
to
act
at
all
if
there
is
no
case
or
controversy,
and
if
there's
no
case
or
controversy,
it
has
no
power
to
do
anything
relating
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
yes,
that
is
my
answer.
i
would
add,
of
course,
that
in
our
view,
the
subpoena
here
was
not
only
unlawful
because
it
was
without
judicial
power,
but
it
was
also
unduly
burdensome,
and
if
you
wanted
to
look
at
it
as
a
matter
of
whether
the
subpoena
is
unduly
burdensome,
certainly
you
could
consider
the
burden
that
is
placed
upon
the
witness.
the
basic
problem--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--there's
no
question
the
court
has
power
to
decide
its
own
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
that's
where
the
court
of
appeals
went
wrong.
as
a
general
matter,
a
court
must
have
power
to
decide
its
own
jurisdiction
and,
therefore,
it
must
have
power
to
enter
those
orders
that
are
necessary
to
enable
it
to
decide
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
go
forward
with
the
case
until
it's
reversed
in
the
sense
that
a
party
may
not
question
jurisdiction,
but
the
critical
point
here
is
that
as
far
as
the
bishops
were
concerned,
there
was
a
final
judgment
entered
as
to
them,
and
this
court
has
held
over
and
over
that
a
judgment
against...
of
contempt
against
a
non-party
witness
is
a
final
judgment
and
the
witness
is
entitled
to
appeal
it
immediately
before
undertaking
any
burden
of
compliance.
the
court
has
also
held
that
a
non-party
contemnor
may,
on
review,
have
a
full
review
of
his
claims,
and
if
the
court...
if
a
non-party
contemnor
is
entitled
to
a
full
review
of
his
claims,
certainly
he
must
be
entitled
to
review
of
the
very
basic
contention
that
there
was
no
power
at
all
to
subpoena
him.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
non-party
witness
may
not
challenge
the
article
iii
power
of
the
district
court,
and
that
is
where
we
say
the
court
of
appeals
committed
error.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
what
they
said
is
that
the
witness
may
raise
the
limited
challenge
that
there
is
no
colorable
jurisdiction.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
i
don't
know
why
they
said
it,
but
i
think
i
know
where
the
error
occurred.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
think
there's
no
question,
once
you
start
looking
at
jurisdiction,
there's
no
reason
not
to
decide
the
question
outright.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
is
it
took
limited
exception
to
the
principle
that
a
court
must
have
power
to
act.
that
exception
being
the
court
necessarily
has
power
to
decide
its
power,
and
if
it
can't
make
a
decision
on
jurisdiction
right
away,
it
can
issue
an
order
as
in
united
mine
workers
to
preserve
the
status
quo,
pending
a
decision
on
jurisdiction.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
it
would
have
reversed
and
found
that
the
contempt
judgment
was
invalid.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
defined
it
at
all.
the
court
just
said
in
one
paragraph
that
we
think
there's
a
colorable
claim
here.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i'm
not
sure
what
they
meant.
i
think
that
the
concept
has
some
meaning
if
the
court
doesn't
have
all
the
information
before
it
to
enable
it
to
decide
the
question.
when
you
have
all
the
information
before
you,
i
don't
know
what
colorable
jurisdiction
means.
this
subpoena,
these
subpoenas,
were
not
issued
to
secure
evidence
relating
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
the
district
court
had
already
decided
that
it
had
jurisdiction,
and,
so,
we
say
that
the
issue
on
appeal
wasn't
whether
the
district
court
had
colorable
jurisdiction
to
decide
its
actual
jurisdiction.
the
issue
is
whether
the
district
court
was
correct
in
deciding
that
it
had
actual
jurisdiction.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
that
would
be
an
option
before
the
court.
i
would
suggest,
however,
that
the
jurisdictional
issue
in
this
case
is
not
a
novel
one,
and
that
the
court
really
doesn't
need
the
guidance
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
it.
the
court
has
addressed
the
question
in
several
cases.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
it
would,
indeed.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i
think,
quite
frankly,
the
court
has
done
it
both
ways,
and
certainly
the
court
could
either
remand
for
a
full
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction
or
it
could
go
ahead
and
decide
the
question
itself.
now,
the
respondents'
main
argument
in
this
court
on
the
question...
on
the
first
issue,
is
that
a
non-party
witness
can't
raise
a
jurisdictional
challenge
on
appeals.
somehow
it's
interlocutory.
this,
i
think,
is
simply
wrong.
this
court
has
held
for
at
least
eighty
years
now
that
a
final
judgment
of
civil
contempt
against
a
non-party
witness
is
immediately
appealable
and
that
the
contemnor
is
entitled
to
a
full
review
of
his
claims.
what
the
respondents
say
is
that
the
bishops
could
have
argued
on
appeal
that
the
contempt
judgment
was
invalid
because
the
subpoenas
were
unduly
burdensome,
that
it
cost
too
much
to
xerox
the
documents,
or
that
it
would
take
too
many
man
hours
to
search
for
the
documents,
but
they
say
that
we
can't
raise
on
appeal
the
more
fundamental
question
whether
or
not
the
subpoenas
were
invalid
all
together
because
they
were
beyond
the
power
of
a
district
court.
what
that
overlooks
is
that
the
first
issue
on
any
appeal
is
the
question
of
jurisdiction
or
power,
not
just
of
the
court
of
appeals,
but
of
the
district
court.
the
appeal
in
this
case
is
really
no
different
from
any
other
appeal
in
that
respect.
the
court
of
appeals
had
an
obligation
to
satisfy
itself
that
the
district
court
had
power
to
act
and
that
the
district
court
was
correct
when
it
found
that
it
did
have
power
to
act.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
certainly,
the
absence
of
article
iii
standing
is.
there
are
also
elements
of
standing
that
are
prudential
in
nature,
but
this
court
has
held
over
and
over
again
that
in
the
absence
of
article
iii
standing,
there
is
no
case
or
controversy,
and
that,
indeed,
there
is
no
more
fundamental
element
of
article
iii
power
than
the
existence
of
standing.
and,
so,
we
say
that
this
is
a
quintessential
article
iii
issue
that
the
court
must
satisfy
itself
on.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
i
think
in
valley
forge,
what
the
court
in
americans
united
v.
valley
forge
was
the
court
said
is
that
article
iii
standing...
that
without
article
iii
standing,
a
plaintiff
may
not
litigate
in
the
federal
courts,
that
it
is
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
court's
article
iii
power,
that
in
the
absence
of
article
iii
standing,
there
simply
is
no
case
or
controversy.
one
final
point
on
the
first
question.
if
the
bishops
can't
raise
their
jurisdictional
challenge
in
the
court
of
appeals,
then
they
can
never
raise
it
at
all
because
they
are
not
parties.
there
will
never
be
another
final
judgment
against
the
bishops
that
they
can
appeal.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
i
suppose
that
they
could,
but
i
think
that
it's
an
elementary
doctrine
that
is
implicit
in
all
of
the
court's
cases,
that
at
some
point,
one
must
be
able
to
have
a
right
of
appeal
from
the
final
judgment
against
you.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
the--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--well,
you
could
say
that
because
you
are
construing
a
statute,
but
if
you
were
to
say
that,
you
would
be
denying
the
party
of
any
meaningful
opportunity
for
review
because
there
is
no
judgment
against
the
bishops
at
the
end
of
the
case.
there's
going
to
be
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that,
the
court
would
be,
in
a
sense,
overruling
nelson
v.
united
states
in
1906,
alexander
v.
the
united
states
in
the
same
year,
united
states
v.
ryan
a
number
of
years
later.
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
court
has
held
that
a
non-party
contemnor
is
entitled
to
an
immediate
appeal
of
the
final
judgment
of
contempt
entered
against
him.
now,
the
rule
is
different
for
party
contemnors.
the
rule
is
quite
clear
in
a
number
of
the
court's
decisions.
that
a
non-party
who
is
held
in
contempt
has
an
immediate
right
of
appeal
whereas
a
party
does
not
because
a
party
will
be
involved
in
other
judgments
that
he
can
then
appeal.
but
the
non-party's
only
opportunity
is
now.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
the
issue
in
blair
was
a
little
different.
the
problem
of
blair
wasn't
that
the
witness
wouldn't
have
had
another
chance
to
get
review
of
his
claim.
the
problem
in
blair
was
that
the
witness
didn't
have
a
claim.
the
witness
can't
say--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--of
course,
the
holding
in
blair
wasn't
that
the
witness
had
no
right
to
review.
the
holding
in
blair
was...
that
he
was
in
contempt
and
he
had
no
defense
to
the
contempt
charge,
that
there
was
no
comparable
argument.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
and
in
the
context
of
the
grand
jury,
that
simply
isn't
a
defense
because
one
cannot
say--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--yes.
the
argument
could
have
been
made
in
blair,
but,
of
course,
blair
did
get
review
of
the
contempt
judgment
and
the
decision
was
the
contempt
judgment
was
valid
because
the
jurisdictional
objection
that
he
raised
was
without
merit,
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
this
is
an
entirely
different
case,
that
we
have
a
jurisdictional
challenge
to
the
existence
of
a
case
or
controversy,
and
we
have
a
civil
court
that
has
purported
to
issue
a
subpoena
without
any
case
before
it.
if
the
district
court
just
decided
one
day
to
subpoena
the
bishops'
documents,
clearly,
that
would
have
been
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
and
what
we're
saying
is
that's
what
happened.
there
was
no
case
or
controversy
authorizing
the
district
court
to
issue
a
subpoena
to
the
bishops
and
to
hold
them
in
contempt.
the
simple
fact
is
that
if
there
was
no
case
or
controversy
before
the
court,
then
there
was
no
judicial
power
at
all,
no
power
to
subpoena
the
bishops,
and
if
there
was
no
power
to
subpoena
them,
they
didn't
have
to
obey
the
subpoena,
and
if
they
didn't
have
to
obey
it,
they
couldn't
be
held
in
contempt
for
disobeying.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
thank
you.
the
issue
of
standing
in
this
case
is
simply
this.
do
those
who
disagree
with
the
catholic
church's
teaching
on
abortion
have
standing
to
challenge
the
church's
tax-exemption
on
the
ground
that
the
church
has
allegedly
crossed
the
line
between
permissible
and
impermissible
political
activities
in
the
area
of
abortion.
this
case
concerns
the
catholic
church
and
abortion,
but
you
can
substitute
any
church
for
the
catholic
church,
indeed,
you
can
substitute
any
exempt
organization
for
the
catholic
church,
and
you
can
substitute
any
controversial
issue
to
the
abortion
issue.
because
if
these
respondents
have
standing
to
challenge
the
catholic
church's
tax-exemption,
then
any
citizen
has
standing
to
enforce...
to
bring
a
suit
to
enforce
section
501(c)(3)
against
any
organization
he
disagrees
with.
those
who
agree
with
the
catholic
church
on
abortion
would
have
standing
to
challenge
the
exemption
of
the
presbyterian
church
or
of
the
american
jewish
congress,
who
have
joined
an
amicus
brief,
pointing
out
that
they
take
a
different
view.
those
who
agree
with
the
catholic
church
or
disagree
with
the
catholic
church
or
any
church
on
any
of
the
issues
the
churches
speak
out
on,
including
arms
control,
civil
rights,
the
economy,
capital
punishment,
to
name
just
a
few,
would
have
standing
to
challenge
the
tax-exemption
of
that
group
on
the
ground
that
the
group's
activities
had
crossed
the
line.
and
what
the
respondents
say
is
that
a
citizen
would
have
standing
to
bring
that
suit,
and
this
is
the
critical
point,
regardless
of
whether
that
citizen
himself
has
been
subjected
to
any
unequal
or
any
unfair
treatment
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
the
complaint
in
this
case
does
not
allege
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
taken
any
enforcement
action
against
any
of
the
respondents.
they
haven't
had
any
tax-exemption
revoked
or
denied.
they
haven't
even
been
threatened
with
enforcement
action.
the
district
court
said--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--if
they
had
had
an
exemption
denied,
they
could
bring
a
lawsuit
challenging
the
denial
of
that
exemption.
they
could
argue...
i'm
sorry?
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
they
could
make
the
substantive
argument
that
they
had
been
denied
equal
protection.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
and
once
they
had
standing
to
get
into
court,
they
could
make
the
argument
of
unequal
treatment.
they
could
make
the
argument
of
establishment
clause
violation.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
and
they
could
say
that
you
can
remedy
this
in
one
of
two
ways.
you
can
take
their
exemption
away
or
you
can
give
us
one.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
if
they're
saying
we
don't
care
what
you
do
to
us,
i
don't
think
they
have
an
injury
that
they're
complaining
about.
the
injury
is
what
was
done
to
them.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
well,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
that
if
their
tax-exemption
had
been
revoked,--
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
--they
could
then
bring
a
lawsuit
saying
that
was
unlawful
and
they
could
say
it
was
unlawful
because
by
revoking
mine
and
not
revoking
anybody
else's,
that's
an
equal
protection
claim.
it
would
be
like
a
selective
prosecution
claim
in
a
criminal
context.
the
point
here,
though,
is
that
there
has
been
no
unequal
treatment
at
all.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
that's
true.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
that's
true.
the
point
is,
there
is
no
dissimilar
treatment
here.
the
respondents
aren't
similarly
situated.
they
would
be
similarly
situated.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kevin
t.
baine
thank
you.
