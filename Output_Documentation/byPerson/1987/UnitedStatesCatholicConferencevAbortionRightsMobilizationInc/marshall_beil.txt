mr.
marshall
beil
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
threshold
question
for
determination
by
this
court
is
what
issues
are
properly
raised
on
this
appeal.
petitioners
here
seek
an
unprecedented
exemption
from
the
rule
against
interlocutory
appeals,
which
is
the
fundamental
principle
of
federal
appellate
jurisdiction.
to
raise
issues
that
no
contemnor
has
ever
been
permitted
to
raise
on
appeal.
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
petitions
are
appealing
from
a
contempt
order,
not
a
final
judgment
on
the
merits.
yet,
the
petitioners,
who
are
non-party
witnesses,
legally
strangers
to
the
lawsuit,
do
not
raise
any
issues
related
to
the
subpoena
or
to
the
contempt
order
themselves.
mr.
marshall
beil
yes,
it
is,
and,
but
it's...
in
order
to
determine
what
issues
can
be
raised
from
that
"final
judgment",
one
should
look
at
the
cases
that
allow
appeals
from
this
determination.
the
fact
that
it's
a
final
determination
does
not
mean...
doesn't
flow
from
that
fact
that
the
petitioners
can
raise
any
issue
that
would
lead
to
the
dismissal
of
the
lawsuit,
which
would,
therefore,
obviate
the
need
for
any
testimony.
mr.
marshall
beil
well,--
mr.
marshall
beil
--no.
first
of
all,
it's
not
true
that
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
here.
mr.
marshall
beil
the
court
makes
a
determination.
district
court
makes
a
determination
of
jurisdiction.
that
determination
is
binding
on
all
parties
who,
or
anybody
that
comes
into
the
lawsuit,
until
reversed
on
a
proper
appeal.
this
appeal
is
not
the
kind
of
appeal
that
raises
jurisdictional
issues.
it
raises...
it's
allowed
as
an
appeal
because
it
raises
issues
that
are
independent
from
the
main
action
but
are
personal
to
the
contemnors,
which
would
be
lost
if
you
had
to--
mr.
marshall
beil
--i
think
that...
well,
this
court
has
made
a
distinction
between
civil
contempt
and
criminal
contempt.
the
criminal
contempt
condition
stands
apart
from
the
main
action
and
is
treated
like
any
other
criminal
action.
so,
i
think
if
there
are
criminal
contempt
for
a
non-party
witness,
they
could
probably
raise
the
jurisdictional
issues.
but
civil
contempt
is
within
the
action
and
it
raises...
the
issues
that
can
be
raised
on
appeal
from
civil
contempt
order
are
different
and
much
more
limited
than
those
that
can
be
raised
from,
i
think,
an
appeal
from
a
criminal
contempt
case.
mr.
marshall
beil
well,
i
think--
mr.
marshall
beil
--united
mine
workers,
which
discusses
at
some
length
the
distinction
between
criminal
and
civil
contempt,
the
court
does
draw
a
distinction
between
criminal
contempt
standing
apart
as
a
separate
action,
and
civil
contempt
is
much
more
related
to
the
action.
mr.
marshall
beil
yes.
mr.
marshall
beil
the
district
court
has
ruled
the
fine
is
payable
to
the
government.
mr.
marshall
beil
to
the
treasury.
mr.
marshall
beil
no,
no.
mr.
marshall
beil
it
is
ruled
as
a
civil
contempt,
part
of
the
civil
contempt.
the
court
ruled
it
was
civil
contempt.
it
is...
there
has
been
no
separate
criminal
proceeding.
civil
contempt
can
either
be
contempt--
mr.
marshall
beil
--well,
no,
because
civil
contempt
can
either
be
coercive,
to
essentially
you
pay...
either
you
produce
the
documents
or
you
pay
the
fine.
if
you
produce
the
documents,
you
don't
have
to
pay
the
fine.
or
it
can
be
compensatory,
which
is
to
say
you
pay
the
plaintiffs
for
damages
caused
by
non-compliance.
criminal
contempt
is
essentially
punishment
for
past
non-compliance,
and
that's
not
the
case
here.
this
is...
what
the
district
court
said
is
that
for
each
day
that
you
do
not
produce
documents,
that
the
fine
has
to
be
paid.
that's
a
coercive
fine,
yes,
but
it
is
traditionally
civil
contempt.
but
if
you
look
at
what
appeals
are
allowed
from
civil
contempt,
which
is
the
issue
here,
not
criminal
contempt,
the
court,
in
ruling
that
civil
contempt
orders
are
appealable,
has
limited
the
issues
that
can
be
raised
to
those
issues
that
are
important
to
the
witness
but
independent
of
the
main
action,
because
to
rule
otherwise
is
essentially
to
create
a
new
class
of
appealable
order
involving
jurisdictional
issues.
mr.
marshall
beil
well,
the
cases
that
have
all
come
up
have
all
been...
well,
in
the
cases
that
allow
civil
contempt
appeals,
alexander,
ryan,
cobbledick,
all
the
issues
were
issues
that
relate
specifically
to
the
witness.
there
were
questions.
was
there
undue
burden.
was
there
first
amendment
privilege.
was
there
a
fifth
amendment
privilege.
in
personam
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
case
that
says
a
witness
can
raise
issues
that
are
intimately
connected
to
the
main
action,
such
as
object
matter
jurisdiction,
but
there
are
cases
that
say
witnesses
can
do
that
and
that's
in
the
blair
line
of
cases,
and
blair
says
that
a
witness
cannot
raise
issues
going
to
the--
mr.
marshall
beil
--yes.
mr.
marshall
beil
i
think
the
court
has
to
be
very
careful.
i
think
the
court--
mr.
marshall
beil
--yes.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
marshall
beil
--yes.
this
court
has
the
power
to
do
that,
but
it's
a
power
that
should
not
be
exercised,
and
the
reason
for
it
is
this.
at
this
point,
there
is
no
special
rule
for
appeals
of
jurisdictional
determinations.
when
a
district
court
denies
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
that
order
is
not
appealable.
if
that
is
challenged
on
a
mandamus
petition,
the
regular
rules
for
mandamus
apply.
there
are
no
special
rules
for
mandamus
for
jurisdictional
issues.
to
exercise
supervisory
power
over
the
lower
courts
in
this
context
would
essentially
throw
out
all
of
that
case
law,
which
is
now
200
years
old,
and
create
a
special
rule
for
jurisdictional
issues
which
this
court
has
so
far
declined
to
create,
and
i
think
it's
a
good
one
because,
otherwise,
you
will
wind
up
having
repeated
appeals
of
jurisdictional
issues
in
any
case
where
jurisdiction
is
a
close
case.
look
at,
for
example,
the
history
of
this
case.
this
case
is
now
nearly
eight
years
old.
the
district
court
has
made
two
determinations
on
jurisdictional
issues.
the
court
of
appeals
has
been
asked
to
review
jurisdictional
issues
two
times,
and
this
court
has
been
asked
to
review
the
jurisdictional
issues
two
times.
if
non-party
witnesses
held
in
contempt
are
allowed
to
raise
jurisdictional
issues
on
their
appeal,
then
this
case,
which
is
now
unusual,
is
going
to
become
the
norm
in
any
case
in
which
jurisdictional--
mr.
marshall
beil
--but
what
is
the
injury
that
that
party
is
being
asked
to
suffer?
mr.
marshall
beil
well,
i
think
actually
the
focus
is
not
on
the
fine
because
that's
one
that's
created
by
his
refusal
to
produce
documents.
the
focus
should
be
on
the
injury
created
by
compliance,
and
that's
not,
in
fact,
an
injury
at
all.
that's
a
duty.
this
court
has
held
several
times,
all
citizens
have
the
obligation
to
come
forward
and
produce
evidence
in
a
case
if
they
have
relevant
evidence.
that's
a
duty
that
i
don't
think
would
raise
an
injury.
certainly,
if
the
court
is
going
to
hold
otherwise,
and
hold
that
the
injury
of
producing
documents
creates
the
right
to
appeal
a
jurisdictional
determination
that
is
made
in
an
underlying
case,
then
it
would
have
to
hold
by
logic
that
the
burden
placed
on
a
defendant,
which
is
much
greater,
he's
going
to
defend
the
case,
discovery
and
trial
and
judgment
and
then
appeal,
that
that
burden
is
so
much
greater
that
he
should
have
an
immediate
right
to
appeal
an
adverse
jurisdictional
determination,
and
this
court
has
never
held
that.
the
court,
in
fact,
has
held
just
the
opposite.
mr.
marshall
beil
that's
right.
mr.
marshall
beil
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
marshall
beil
yes.
mr.
marshall
beil
that
is
right.
we're
saying,
essentially,
that
as
a
third
party
witness,
the
issue
of
jurisdiction...
he
takes
the
court
as
he
finds
it,
the
determination
by
the
district
court
of
its
jurisdiction
is
a
determination
that
the
district
court
has
the
right
to
make
and
that
simply
is
not
reversible.
the
injury
that
the
non-party
witness
has
been
called
forth
to
produce
that
evidence
suffers,
which
is
compliance
with
a
public
duty
to
produce
documents,
doesn't
give
rise
to
an
appealable
injury
on
the
jurisdictional
issue
because,
if
it
does,
it
would
mean
that
any
denial
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
jurisdictional
issues
would
have
to
be
automatically
appealable.
i
don't
think
this
court...
this
court
has
certainly
never
held
that.
also,
if
you
hold
that,
however,
the
possibility
of
not
only
repeated
appeals,
because,
after
all,
each
witness
that
comes
forward
and
is
subpoenaed
and
doesn't
produce
documents
can
raise
the
issue
again
because
he's
not...
there's
been
no
res
judicata,
you
also
have
the
possibility
of
inconsistent
rulings
by
different
district
courts
and
different
circuits
around
the
country,
because
a
witness
can
only
be
subpoenaed
in
his
home
state,
in
his
home
district,
in
fact,
and
can
raise
any
challenges
to
that
subpoena
in
his
home
district.
so,
if
you
had
a
case,
as
this
is
like
the
case
may
involve,
you
have
witnesses
here
in
washington,
maybe
witnesses
elsewhere
in
the
country,
it
could
raise
a
jurisdictional
issue
in
another
district
court
and
a
second
circuit,
another
circuit,
would
be
looking
at
it,
and
you
would
have
inconsistent...
conceivably
have
inconsistent
rulings
by
different
courts
on
the
same
issue
in
the
same
case
that
could
not
be
resolved
by
this
court.
mr.
marshall
beil
yes,
but
may
not
necessarily
be
frivolous
appeals,
and
certainly
a
decision
by
one
district
or
one
circuit
is
not
binding
on
a
determination
by
another
circuit.
so
that
the
issue
can
be
raised
in
a
different
circuit
without
being
frivolous
or
somehow
improper.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
other
issue
in
the
case,
which
is
the
question
of
standing.
respondents
do
not
believe
this
court
should
reach
the
issue
of
standing
because
the...
actually,
let
me
step
back
and
say
something
further
about
response
to
justice
white's
questions
about
what
colorable
means.
what
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
is
that
there
is
essentially
a
safety
valve
that
exists
in
the
federal
system
for
determinations
by
district
courts
that
are
totally
bereft
of
any
rational
argument.
mr.
marshall
beil
yes.
in--
mr.
marshall
beil
--in
the
way
you
would
consider
jurisdiction
on
a
mandamus
petition.
it
is--
mr.
marshall
beil
--yes.
it
was
essentially
treating
the
jurisdictional
issue
as
a
mandamus
petition.
mr.
marshall
beil
well,
i
think...
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
doing
that.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
recognizing
is
that
jurisdictional
determinations
are
not
appealable,
but
you
can
bring
a
mandamus
petition
to
challenge
a
usurpation
of
power,
and
that
this
was
the
jurisdictional
challenge
here
was
the
equivalent
of
a
mandamus
petition
raising
a
question
of
whether
there
was
a
usurpation
of
power.
in
fact,
the
district
court...
the
court
of
appeals
in
stating
why
it
found
that
there
was
colorable
jurisdiction
used
the
term
"usurpation
of
power",
which
indicates
to
me
that
it
was,
in
fact,
applying
a
mandamus
standard
here.
mr.
marshall
beil
i
think
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
did
it
was
mandamus.
the
court
said
the
district
court
cannot
be
said
to
be
usurping
power
in
determining
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
exists.
that's
the
standard
used
in
a
mandamus
petition.
mr.
marshall
beil
well,
usurpation
of
power
means
essentially
that's
there
no
rational
argument
in
support
of
a
district
court's
determination.
it
is
not
that
the
district
court
is
right
or
that
the
district
court
is
wrong,
but
that
there
is
essentially
a
total
absence
of
any
power
here.
it's
the
standard
that
this
case
has
always
applied
to
mandamus
petitions
challenging
jurisdictional
determinations.
mr.
marshall
beil
i
guess
it
comes
back
to
the
question
of
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
jurisdiction,
and
that
determination,
respondents
suggest,
remains
unassailable
until
appeal
of
a
final
judgment.
if
the
district
court
has
usurped
power,
has
done...
gone
so
far
that
this
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
would
grant
a
mandamus
petition,
which,
in
fact,
was
filed
here,
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court
and
by
the
government
and
rejected
both
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
that
usurpation
of
power
is
challengeable.
blair
recognizes
that.
blair
recognizes
beyond--
mr.
marshall
beil
--on
the
jurisdictional
issue,
i
think
that's
the
case.
the
petitioners
have
plenary
appeal
on
issues
personal
to
the
witness.
issues
that
are
not
raised
here.
privilege,
burden,
confidentiality.
notions
like
that
are
raised
here.
mr.
marshall
beil
yes.
mr.
marshall
beil
yes,
but
we're
not
dealing,
as
i
say,
we're
not
dealing
with
a
criminal
contempt
here.
he
is
not
being
punished
for
past
non-compliance.
mr.
marshall
beil
well,
justice
kennedy
is
correct
in
that.
i
don't
think--
mr.
marshall
beil
--i
think
it
would
have
to
be
the
same
under
mine
workers,
it
would
have
to
be
the
same.
mr.
marshall
beil
yes.
mr.
marshall
beil
if
it
had
decided
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction,
yes,
i
think
that
decision
would
have
been
wrong
for
two
reasons.
one,
because
i
don't
think
they
should
have
reached
it,
and,
two,
because
i
think
it
would
have
been
wrong
on
the
merits.
i'd
like
to
turn,
in
fact,
to
the
merits
on
that.
on
the
standing
question,
and
to
suggest
that
this
case
differs
from
allen
v.
wright
and
prior
determinations
of
this
court,
by
particularly
looking
at
the
claim
that's
made
by
the
clergy
respondents
here.
the
clergy
respondents
claim
is
under
the
establishment
clause.
in
fact,
it's
a
claim
that
goes
to
the
core
of
the
establishment
clause.
it's
a
claim
of
preference,
of
one
religion
over
another,
which
this
court
has
held
is
the
clearest
command
of
the
establishment
clause,
that
kind
of
governmental
preference
is
forbidden.
but
when
a
challenge
is
made
to
governmental
preference,
one
religion
over
another,
the
most
logical
plaintiffs
to
challenge
that
determination
would
be
clergy
members
of
the
disfavored
group.
to
take
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
and
put
it
into
the
establishment
clause
context,
suppose
the
government
announced
that
it
was
subsidizing
only,
say,
quaker
school
education,
that
the
government
would
give
cash
grants
to
schools
that
taught
quaker
theology,
i
don't
think
this
court
would
have
any
question,
any
hesitation
in
allowing
clergy
members
who
ran
schools
that
didn't
teach
quaker
theology
from
challenging
that
determination.
mr.
marshall
beil
yes,
but
if
this
were
an
administrative--
mr.
marshall
beil
--well,
except
that
the
difference
here,
though,
is
that
the
enforcement...
the
failure
to
enforce
is
the
equivalent
of
a
subsidy.
so,
while
we
are
challenging--
mr.
marshall
beil
--but
in
valley
forge,
the
plaintiffs
there
had...
were
not
people
who
ran
other
hospitals
or
other
colleges.
they
were
not
people
who
were
seeking
the
surplus
governmental
property
that
was
at
issue
there.
here,
we
have
clergy
members
who
are
directly
affected,
personally
affected
by
the
same
laws
that
their
catholic
counterparts
are
affected
by,
but
the
preference
is
given
to
the
catholic
clergy
but
not
to
the
clergy
respondents.
mr.
marshall
beil
well,
i
think
that
those
people
would
certainly
have
standing,
but
certainly
under
the
establishment
clause,
you
don't...
coercion
is
absent.
mr.
marshall
beil
that's
what
we're
arguing
here.
mr.
marshall
beil
well,
i
think
that
the
court
has
held
that
the
tax-exemption
or
tax
deduction
is
the
equivalent
of
a
cash
grant.
the
government,
in
effect,
pays
for
certain
activities
by
making
it
cheaper
to
do
those
activities.
you
don't
have
to
pay
taxes
on
those
activities,
and
when
that
power
is
exercised
in
a
discriminatory
fashion,
to
prefer
one
religion,
i
think,
in
fact,
that
is
the
equivalent
of
an
endorsement
of
that
religion.
mr.
marshall
beil
death
is
the
only
other
thing
i
can
think
of.
but
this
case
is
not
really
brought
under
taxpayers
standing.
we
are
seeking...
because
we
are
seeking...
we
are
challenging
the
enforcement
action.
the
respondents
are
challenging
the
enforcement
action,
not
an
action
by
congress.
so
that
what
you
have
here
is
a
situation
in
which
essentially
the
disfavored
clergy
are
seeking
to
remove
the
preferential
treatment
to
the
favored
group,
and
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
you
don't
need
to
show
that
there's
been
coercion
on
the
respondents
themselves
in
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
marshall
beil
well,
i
think
abington,
in
fact,
says
that,
and
engel
both
say
that
coercion
is
not
an
element.
mr.
marshall
beil
what
the
nature
of
a
claim
under
an
establishment
clause
is
the
preference...
the
nature
of
the
injury
is
the
preference.
the
fact
that
one
group
is
being
preferred,
as
justice
o'connor
said,
that
that
is
a
message
of
endorsement,
that
is
sent
to
the
world,
that
one
group
is
the
favored
included
insider
group
and
the
other
group
is
the
excluded
the
outsider
group,
and
the
outsiders
should
be
able
to
challenge
the
preference.
they
don't
need...
they
don't
have
to
ask
for
that
preference
themselves
because
under
the
establishment
clause,
in
fact,
they
don't
want
that
benefit.
the
respondents
here
do
not
seek
to
be
able
to
use
tax-exempt
money
in
political
campaigns,
but
i
don't
think
that
they
have
to...
that
that
makes
a
difference
because
when
the
question
is
unequal
treatment,
the
court
has
two
alternatives
to
remedy
that.
one
is
to
extend
the
remedy
to
the
disfavored
group
or
the
other
is
to
withdraw
it
from
the
favored
group,
and
this
court
has
held
in
various
cases
that
deal
with
how
to
remedy
under-inclusive
statutes
and
unequal
treatment
cases
that
the
availability
of
either
remedy
gives
standing
to
those
who,
for
example,
seek
to
have
the
preference
removed.
mr.
marshall
beil
well,
i
think
that
could...
i
think
a
challenge
could
be
made
that
way.
i
think
the
challenge
would
lose
because
i
think
this
court
has
held
that
chaplains
are
permissible.
mr.
marshall
beil
yes.
mr.
marshall
beil
yes.
favoritism
is
what
we're
complaining
about.
mr.
marshall
beil
because
if
one
would
argue
that
that's
the...
the
giving
of
the
chaplain
to
one
group
is
an.
establishment
and
that
the
court...
the
government
has
to
be
neutral,
therefore
can't
have
any
chaplains,
i
think
that's
a
remedy.
mr.
marshall
beil
well,
in
heckler
v.
mathews
and
orr
v.
orr,
which
are...
one
is
a
gender
discrimination
case
and
i
guess
they
both,
in
fact,
are
gender
discrimination
cases,
the
court
has
held
that
the
mandate
of
equal
treatment,
which
could
be
done
either
way,
either
by
extending
or
by
removing,
and
that
you
don't...
because
a
plaintiff
is
seeking
only
one,
but
both
remedies
are
available,
doesn't
mean
that
that
plaintiff
doesn't
have
standing,
because
otherwise
no
one
would
have
standing
because
you'd
always
say,
well,
he's
seeking
this,
but
the
remedy
is
that.
he's
seeking
that,
the
remedy
is
here,
and
no
one
would
have
standing,
and
this
court,
in
orr
and
heckler,
has
said
just
the
opposite.
and
i
think
since
this
is
an
establishment
clause
claim,
i
think
we
should
take
a
look
at
some
of
the
prudential
concerns
that
this
court
has
raised,
and
realize
that
in
an
establishment
clause
claim,
it's
very
important
to
provide
a
judicial
remedy
because
if
the
plaintiffs
can't
bring
this
lawsuit,
then
what
it
means
is
that
they
have
to
go
into
the
political
process
to
try
to
remedy
the
problem
they're
complaining
about.
yet,
that
would
bring
the
religious
divisions
that
the
plaintiffs
are
complaining
about
into
the
political
process,
which
is
exactly
what
the
first
amendment
has
sought
to
avoid,
sought
to
take
to
avoid
political
division
along
religious
lines,
to
avoid
political
divisiveness.
and
that
is
also
true
of
the
claim
made
by
the
voter
respondents,
political
participant
respondents.
they
are
claiming
the
challenge...
their
injury
is
a
skewing
of
the
political
process
by
the
government.
you
cannot
expect
the
political
process
to
correct
that
problem.
this
court
is
the
place
where
the
independent
branch,
which
can
create
a
remedy,
to
create
to
fix
the
problem,
to
cure
the
problem
of
the
skewing
of
the
political
process
or
political
divisions
along
religious
lines.
thank
you.
