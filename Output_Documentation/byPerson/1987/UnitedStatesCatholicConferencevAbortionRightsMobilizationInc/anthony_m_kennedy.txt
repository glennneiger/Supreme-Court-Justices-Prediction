if

the
second
case
is
united
states
catholic
conference
versus
abortion
rights
mobilization
inc.
this
case
comes
before
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
action
in
the
dispute,
which
underlies
this
case,
is
a
suit
in
which
certain
coalitions
and
persons,
who
advocate
a
pro-abortion
position,
are
suing
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
the
suit
is
to
compel
those
officials
to
revoke
the
tax-exempt
status
as
roman
catholic
church
and
certain
of
its
related
entities
in
the
united
states.
united
states
catholic
conference
and
national
conference
of
catholic
bishops
were
once
parties
to
this
suit
but
were
then
dismissed.
they
remained
important
witnesses
however,
which
gives
rise
to
the
case
before
us.
the
plaintiffs
in
the
tax
exemption
suit
served
subpoenas
on
the
two
conferences
as
potential
witnesses.
the
subpoenas
were
broad
in
scope
and
require
production
of
extensive
documentary
evidence
including
documents
which
was
alleged
would
reflect
the
church's
support
for
pro-life
candidates
and
initiatives
in
local
state
and
federal
elections.
the
conferences
refused
to
comply
with
the
subpoenas.
after
a
series
of
court
orders
to
produce,
intertwined
with
other
procedural
motions,
the
conferences
remained
steadfast
in
their
refusal
to
turnover
the
information.
the
district
court
eventually
held
the
conferences
in
civil
contempt.
it
assessed
to
fine
against
the
two
conferences
in
the
sum
of
$50,000
per
day
each
for
every
day
they
refuse
to
comply.
the
order
was
stayed
pending
appeal
and
the
stay
remains
in
effect.
the
conferences
appealed
the
contempt
sanction
to
the
second
circuit.
they
argued
that
the
trial
court
lack
any
subject-matter
jurisdiction
over
the
underlying
action
primarily
because
the
plaintiffs
had
no
standing
sue
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
or
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
to
compel
them
to
revoke
the
tax
exemption.
it
followed,
the
conferences
argued,
that
the
lower
court
was
without
authority
to
issue
the
subpoenas.
while
recognizing
that
the
conferences
were
proper
parties
before
it,
since
they
have
the
right
to
appeal
the
contempt
order,
the
circuit
held
that
the
witnesses
could
challenge
jurisdiction
only
if
they
allege
that
the
district
court
lack
even
colorable
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
contested
suit.
on
this
reasoning,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
the
sanctions
and
rejected
the
contention
that
it
could
examine
the
subject-matter
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
whether
a
nonparty
witness
may
defend
against
the
civil
contempt
adjudication
by
challenging
the
subject-matter
jurisdiction
of
the
trial
court.
we
now
reverse.
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
45
grants
the
district
court
the
power
to
issue
subpoenas
as
to
witnesses
and
documents,
but
the
subpoena
power
of
a
court
cannot
be
more
extensive
than
its
jurisdiction,
because
the
civil
contempt
adjudication
is
a
final
judgment
as
to
the
person
in
contempt.
we
have
previously
held
that
the
contempt
adjudication
is
appealable
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
a
final
judgment
in
the
underlying
action.
we
hold
that
a
nonparty
witness,
when
appealing
the
finding
of
civil
contempt,
may
challenge
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
issuing
court.
the
challenge
in
this
case
goes
to
the
power
of
the
court
to
issue
the
order.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
