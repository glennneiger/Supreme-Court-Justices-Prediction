mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
plan
to
devote
my
time
to
the
issue
that
is
of
most
concern
to
the
federal
government,
the
underlying
question
of
whether
the
plaintiffs
have
standing
to
bring
this
suit
against
the
internal
revenue
service,
seeking
to
compel
us
to
revoke
the
tax-exemption
of
a
third
party.
that
standing
issue
raises
a
general
problem
that
the
court
has
confronted
on
several
occasions
in
recent
years.
namely,
the
circumstances
under
which
the
federal
courts
may
be
asked
to
review
the
workings
of
the
executive
branch
by
a
party
who
is
not
directly
affected
by
government
actions.
the
basic
principle
in
these
cases
is
that
the
plaintiffs
have
standing
to
challenge
executive
action
only
when
they
have
suffered
a
concrete
injury
thereby,
and
one
principle
that
the
court
has
made
clear
time
and
time
again
is
that
the
courts
will
not
entertain
challenges
brought
by
citizens
whose
interest
is
no
more
than
a
generalized
interest
in
having
the
government
obey
or
enforce
the
law.
in
the
words
of
this
court,
the
federal
judiciary
is
not
an
ombudsman
of
the
general
welfare.
it
is
not
designed
to
act
as
a
continuing
monitor
of
the
wisdom
and
soundness
of
executive
actions.
in
our
view,
the
injury
that
is
claimed
here
is
so
theoretical
and
abstract
that
acceptance
of
it
would
almost
completely
obliterate
this
principle
that
limits
judicial
monitoring
of
the
executive
branch.
it
would
expose
the
government
to
untold
numbers
of
suits
by
interested
but
not
affected
persons
who
seek
to
challenge
its
day-to-day
execution
of
the
laws.
specifically,
we
think
the
claim
of
injury
here
is
considerably
weaker
than
the
claims
of
injury
that
have
been
asserted
to
underlie
standing
in
recent
cases
that
the
court
has
rejected
standing.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
claimed
injury
in
this
case,
basically
the
gist
of
it,
is
that
there
has
been
government
favoritism,
that
the
government...
that
the
catholic
church
has
violated
the
prerequisites
for
having
a
section
501(c)(3)
tax-exemption
and,
yet,
the
government
has
failed
to
take
away
that
tax-exemption.
therefore,
this
failure
to
enforce
the
law
by
the
government
as
somehow
favoritism
towards
an
entity
with
whom
the
plaintiffs
disagree
and
that
favoritism
necessarily
injures
them.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
congress
passed
a
law
that
contributions--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
one
thing
that
is
distinguishing
or
that
is
different
about
this
case
is
that
the
plaintiffs
have
not...
are
not
claiming
any
right
of
their
own,
and
in
the
case
of--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think
in
that--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think
the
republican
party
would
then
claim
a
tax-exemption
of
its
own.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
at
a
minimum,
a
member
of
the
republican
party
would
have
standing
to
claim
the
denial
of
the
tax-exemption
to
himself...
to
the
republican
party,
and
they
could
raise
such
a
defense
or
as
the
basic
claim
that
there
was
an--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--they
could
bring
a
separate
action
challenging.
i'm
not
sure.
possibly
not.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
possibly
not.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
they
usually
come
up
in
the
context
of
the
plaintiff's
own
entitlement
to
a
certain
benefit.
yes.
i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
it's
essential
here,
this
is
where
the
idea
that
there
is
a
separation
of
powers
component
that
underlies
article
iii.
i
mean,
it
is
not
contemplated
that
the
government
will
be
passing
clearly
on
constitutional
laws
and
that
the
executive
will
enforce
them,
but
there
is--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yeah.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
first,--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
reason
why
this
case
is
different?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
first,
you're
not
allowing
the
republicans
to
bring
a
suit
challenging
their
own
tax
status.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
would
say
this
case
is
different
in
a
lot
of
ways.
i
guess
i'm
not
entirely
sure
myself
what
the
answer
is
to
your
question,
but
this
case
is
different
in
a
lot
of
ways
because
there
is
not
the
same
element
of
causation
here
that
there
is
in
that
case.
i
mean,
there,
there
is
a
direct
relationship.
i
mean,
you
have
a
suit
that
is
brought
by
the
republican
party,
which
is
a
direct
competitor,
shall
we
say,
of
the
democratic
party.
here,
you
have
a
suit
that
is
just
brought
by
citizens
who
claim
that
there
is
some
abstract
injury
out
there
in
the
arena
of
public
debate
because
one
of
the
other
manifold--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
no.
they
make
no
claim
that
they're
entitled
to
any.
never
sought
such
a
tax-exemption,
and
they
make
no
real
claim
of
injury
to
themselves
in
any
bottom
line
sense.
all
they
claim
is
that
conferring
some
advantage
and
there's
no
real
attempt
to
claim
a
significant
advantage
there
either,
but
any
advantage
that
is
granted
to
a
competitor
in
the
area
of
political
debate
automatically
confers
a
disadvantage
on
them
that
gives
them
the
right
to
sue.
that
is
just
too
open-ended
of
a
claim
because
it
basically
opens
the
courts
up
to
any
claim
to
any
government
action.
almost
any
company,
any
organization
is
in
some
sense
a
participant
in
a
political
debate,
and
to
say
that
any
government
action
that
increases
the
amount
of
money
that
one
participant
in
the
debate
will
have,
that
that
is
automatically
disadvantaged
to
the
other
party,
just
leaves
this
an
area
with
no
bounds
on
it
whatsoever.
now,
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
these
kind
of
cases
are
not
appropriate
for
federal
court
adjudication.
this
is
a
challenge
first
to
an
executive
enforcement
program.
the
court
in
allen
said
that's
rarely,
if
ever,
appropriate
for
federal
court
adjudication.
in
addition,
it's
a
suit
that
challenged
the
tax-exemption
of
a
third
party.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
absolutely
not.
the
plaintiffs
are
relying
on
the
statute.
they're
simply
claiming
that
in
this
particular
instant,
the
irs
is
not
enforcing
it,
and
they
don't
even
claim...
they
certainly
don't
point
to
any
action
taken
by
the
irs.
what
they're
arguing
for
is
inaction,
and
in
heckler
v.
chaney,
a
case
where
the
court...
where
there
was
an
actual
affirmative
statutory
right
to
review,
the
court
pointed
out
how
unusual
it
is
to
have
review
of
inaction,
and
this
is
even
a
weaker
case
than
chaney
because
it's
not...
in
chaney,
at
least,
there
was
a
government
decision
not
to
take
enforcement
action.
you
don't
even
have
anything
like
that
here.
all
you
have
is
the
allegation
that
the
irs
has
not
as
yet
taken
any
action
against
the
church.
we
don't
know
what
they're
likely
to
do
in
the
future.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
there
is
something
that
the
district
court
called
establishment
clause
standing,
and
that
just
falls
back
on
the
basic
claim
of
favoritism.
what
the
court
said
was
that
if
one
entity
is
favored
and
that
entity
favored
by
the
fact
that
there's
a
failure
to
enforce
the
law
against
it,
and
if
that
entity
is
a
religious
entity,
then
that
is
automatically
an
establishment
clause
violation.
i
would
say
two
things
to
that.
first
of
all,
it's
not
automatically
an
establishment
clause
violation.
it's
just
an
enforcement
decision
by
the
government.
and,
second,
even
if
it
is,
it
doesn't
enter
the
plane
in
any
specific
way
any
more
than
there
was
an
injury
in
the
valley
forge
case.
that's
just
a
claim
by
a
citizen
that
any
establishment
clause
violation
gives
a
right
to
any
citizen
to
sue
the
federal
government.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
we
don't
think
so,
although
as
mr.
baine
said,
it's
hard
to
know
what
they
meant.
that
phrase
is
taken
out
of
the
cases
that
involve
the
inquiry
by
the
court
into
whether
it
has
jurisdiction,
and--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--we
participated
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
that
issue...
i
don't
know
what
we
said
on
that
issue.
