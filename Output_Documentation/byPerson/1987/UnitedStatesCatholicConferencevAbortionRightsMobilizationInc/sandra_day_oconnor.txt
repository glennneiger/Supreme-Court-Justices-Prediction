justice
o'connor
mr.
baine,
if
the
case
were
one
in
which
the
burden
on
the
witness
was
minimal
rather
than
the
greater
burden
that
you
allege
in
this
case
for
these
witnesses,
do
you
think
that
any
witness
should
be
able
to
make
the
same
jurisdictional
challenge,
regardless
of
the
burden
on
the
witness?
justice
o'connor
well,
so,
is
your
answer
to
me
yes,
regardless
of
the
extent
of
the
burden
any
witness
in
any
circumstance
should
be
able
to
make
this
kind
of
a
challenge?
justice
o'connor
is
there
an
establishment
clause
challenge
being
made?
justice
o'connor
and
where
does
the
fine...
where
is
the
fine
payable?
to
the
court?
justice
o'connor
to
the
government.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
might
make
it
criminal?
justice
o'connor
why
not?
justice
o'connor
don't
we
need
to
know
what
the
nature
of
the
sanction
imposed
to
determine
whether
it's
civil
or
criminal
and
if
the
fine
is
payable
to
the
court?
does
that
make
it
criminal?
justice
o'connor
mr.
beil,
do
you
think
it's
open...
it
was
open
to
the
court
of
appeals
sua
sponte
to
determine
that
there
was
no
article
iii
standing
and
to
dismiss?
justice
o'connor
was
it
open
to
the
court
to
do
that?
justice
o'connor
is
it
open
to
this
court
to
do
that
as
well?
justice
o'connor
now,
if
the
second
circuit
here
had
decided
that
there
was
no
standing
and
no
article
iii
jurisdiction,
would
that
have
been
reversible
error?
justice
o'connor
even
though
sua
sponte
could
have
made
that
decision?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
the
court
has
allowed
any
citizen
standing
to
challenge
taxing
and
spending
decisions
by
legislative
bodies.
justice
o'connor
this
is
an
enforcement
agency
challenge.
justice
o'connor
well,
that
could
have
been
said
in
valley
forge,
couldn't
it?
