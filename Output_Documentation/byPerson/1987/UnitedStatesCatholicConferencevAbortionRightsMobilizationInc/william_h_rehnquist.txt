chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
87-416,
the
united
states
catholic
conference
et
al.
,
versus
the
abortion
rights
mobilization,
inc.,
et
al.
mr.
baine,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
baine,
certainly
there's
language
in
blair
v.
united
states,
as
you
know,
that
it
certainly
cuts
against
your
position.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
lack
of
standing
as
quintessentially
jurisdictional
as,
say,
the
absence
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
case
of
ours
comes
closest
to
supporting
that
particular
proposition,
that
lack
of
article
iii
standing
is
just
like
lack
of,
say,
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
couldn't
they
raise
it
by
mandamus
in
the
court
of
appeals?
you
can
get
review
of
some
extreme
discovery
orders
that
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
baine.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
horowitz.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
horowitz,
what
precisely
is
the
claimed
injury
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--were
any
of
the
plaintiffs
here
people
who
had
had
their
tax-exemptions
revoked
because
of
political
activity?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
challenge
to
the
statute
itself
here
as
opposed
to
the
way
it's
administered?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
horowitz.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
beil.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yet,
it
is
a
final
judgment
as
to
them,
isn't
it,
mr.
beil?
adjudicating
them
in
contempt?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
now,
what
is
your
authority
for
that
proposition?
because
it
doesn't
strike
me
as
self-evidence
at
all.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
cases
do
you
say
support
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
case
do
you
rely
on
for
the
proposition
that
an
appeal
in
a
civil
contempt
action
cannot
raise
an
issue
unless
it's
independent
of
the
main
action?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
blair
is
your
closest
case
to
support
that
proposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
just
as
a
matter
of
judicial
administration,
that's
sort
of
a
halfway
house,
it
seems
to
me,
that
has
a
good
deal
to
be
criticized
and
not
much
to
commend
itself.
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
jurisdiction
at
all,
why
create
kind
of
a
twilight
zone?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
then
this
doctrine
really
gives
the
petitioners
nothing
that
a
writ
of
mandamus
or
the
application
for
writ
of
mandamus
might
not
give
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
personal
to
the
witness,
you
mean
by
that
that
they
affect
the
witness
and
no
one
else
in
the
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
because
certainly
it's
kind
of
personal
to
go
to
jail.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
say
it
would
be
different
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
criminal
contempt?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
think
it's
the
same.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
that
the
true
counterpart,
the
counterpart
for
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
would
be
an
organization
in
which
it
had
its
tax-exemption
revoked,
because
it
had
been
lobbying
or
it
had
been
active
politically,
and
they
say
you
revoke
my
tax-exemption
but
you
didn't
revoke
the
catholic
church's,
which
was
doing
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
establishment
clause
standing
is
to
attack
spending
of
money.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
it's
a
long
way
around
to
say
that
you're
attacking
a
spending
of
money.
none
of
our
cases
have
gone
that
far.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
beil.
mr.
baine,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
baine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
