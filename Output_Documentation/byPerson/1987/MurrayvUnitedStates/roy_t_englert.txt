mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
try
to
make
clear
at
the
outset
exactly
what
the
government's
position
is
in
this
case.
when
evidence
is
seized
pursuant
to
a
valid
untainted
warrant,
we
submit
that
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
prior
illegal
search
does
not
require
the
suppression
of
any
of
the
evidence
seized
pursuant
to
the
warrant,
unless
there
is
a
causal
connection
between
the
illegal
search
and
the
seizure
of
the
evidence
pursuant
to
the
warrant.
now,
mr.
randolph
disputes
our
position
that
there's
no
causal
connection
in
this
case,
but
it's
also
important
to
understand
before
getting
into
the
merits
of
that
question
that
mr.
randolph
contends
that
this
evidence,
all
the
evidence
seen
during
the
assumed
illegal
search,
must
be
suppressed
whether
or
not
there
was
any
causal
connection.
if
the
petitioners
are
right,
then
there's
no
need
to
get
into
the
question
of
causal
connection.
so,
the
first
question
i'd
like
to
address
is
whether
they
are
right.
the
government's
position,
as
i
stated
it
a
moment
ago,
is
with
one
qualification
exactly
what
this
court
held
three
years
ago
in
segura
v.
united
states.
the
one
necessary
qualification,
which
has
already
received
some
discussion
this
morning,
is
that
the
court
was
addressing
only
part
of
the
evidence
seized
pursuant
to
the
warrant
in
segura.
only
the
evidence
that
had
been
present
but
not
seen
during
the
unlawful
entry
was
at
issue
in
segura.
the
2nd
circuit
had
suppressed
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
seen
during
the
unlawful
entry.
the
government
had
not
cross
petitioned
on
that
issue.
i
would
note
for
the
record,
however,
that
we
were
very
careful
in
our
brief
in
segura
in
footnote
21
to
state
that
our
position
was
that
that
evidence
should
not
have
been
suppressed
either,
even
though
we
did
not
cross
petition
on
it.
footnote
21
of
our
brief
stated
that
the
independent
source
and
the
inevitable
discovery
documents
should
apply
to
the
previously-seen
evidence
just
as
to
the
previously-unseen
evidence.
and
when
mr.
fry,
in
his
argument
in
this
court,
discussed
the
distinction
between
seen
and
unseen
evidence,
he
was
quite
careful
to
say
that
that
was
a
distinction
the
court
of
appeals
had
drawn,
not
necessarily
a
distinction
the
government
was
making.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
he
said
it
may.
may
be
suppressed.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we
do
not.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
believe
the
sentence
continues,
"as
it
was
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
"
and
that's
a
sentence
very
similar
to
the
sentence
you
can
find
in
the
text
of
our
brief
in
segura,
a
sentence
off
of
which
footnote
21
hangs,
saying
that
we
were
not
endorsing
that
view.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
he
was,
of
course,
assuming
that,
but
that
was
one
of
several
deterrents
that
the
chief
justice
discussed.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
civil
liability
was
one
of
the
deterrents.
administrative
sanctions
were
another
deterrent
that
he
discussed.
another
deterrent,
which
i
believe
was
not--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
we
certainly
do
rely
on
those.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no
sanction
whatsoever,
your
honor,
because
that
doesn't
bear
on
the
determination
that
the
magistrate
makes,
which
is
whether
probable
cause
exists.
we
think
that
that
is
commendable
police
practice,
to
avoid
taint
in
the
warrant
when
there's
a
question
of
taint,
and
to
put
before
the
magistrate
only
the
evidence
that
is
known
to
be
untainted,
so
that
the
magistrate
can
make
the
probable
cause
determination.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
is--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
you're
quite
correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
our
view
is
quite
different
from
that
suggestion.
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
additional
deterrents
in
cases
such
as
this.
there
is
an
exclusionary
deterrent,
which
is
it
is
the
government
that
must
convince
the
finder
of
fact
that
the
decision
to
obtain
a
warrant
was,
indeed,
independent
of
what
was
seen
and
learned
during
the
prior
assumably
unlawful
entry.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
was
no
finding
in
so
many
words
because,
as
mr.
randolph
said
a
moment
ago,
this
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
lower
court.
the
argument
that
no
warrant
would
have
been
sought
but
for
what
the
agents
saw
during
the
warrantless
entry
is
one
the
petitioners
are
making
for
the
very
first
time
in
this
court.
it
was
not
made
in
the
district
court.
it
was
not
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
argument
was
not
framed
in
those
terms.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
suppress
everything.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
suppress
everything
that
bears
that
causal
relationship
to
the
unlawful
search.
we
concede
that
that
should
be
suppressed.
we
advocate
that
should
be
suppressed.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it's
the
government's
burden
of
proof,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no.
there's
only
a
failure
of
proof
on
an
issue
that
was
uncontested.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we
certainly
have
the
burden
of
showing
a
lack
of
causal
relation.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
lack
of
causal
relation
was
at
issue
in
the
lower
courts,
but
the
only
contested
aspect
of
that
issue
in
the
lower
courts
was
whether
the
acquisition
of
the
warrant...
well,
in
fact,
i'm
not
sure
there
was
any
contested
aspect
of
that
in
the
lower
courts.
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
lower
courts,
which
is
repeated
here
today,
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
if
there's
a
causal
relationship.
everything
that's
seen
has
to
be
suppressed.
it's
for
that
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
state
with
such
confidence
that
there
was
no
causal
relationship
in
this
case
because
nobody
was
contending
otherwise.
the
contention
was
you
don't
need
a
causal
relationship.
now,
on
this
question
of
whether
you
do
need
a
causal
relationship,
there
is
a
difference
between
segura
and
this
case.
segura
involved
previously-unseen
evidence.
this
case
involves
previously-seen
evidence.
according
to
petitioners,
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
they
say
that
everything
has
to
be
suppressed
if
it
was
seen.
that
argument
has
been
presented
to
five
federal
courts
of
appeals
in
the
three
years
since
segura
was
decided.
all
five
have
rejected
that
argument
and
have
admitted
previously-seen
evidence
in
the
absence
of
a
causal
relationship.
the
1st,
2nd,
4th,
7th
and
9th
circuits.
the
2nd
circuit,
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
overruled
its
own
prior
segura
decision
to
the
extent
that
it
requires
suppression
of
previously-seen
evidence
in
the
absence
of
a
causal
relationship.
there
are,
of
course,
courts
that
have
ruled
against
the
government
in
cases
that
have
some
similarity
to
this.
in
particular,
in
cases
in
which
the
evidence
was
physically
seized
during
the
entry
and
the
argument
was
only,
well,
we
would
have
gotten
a
warrant
if
we
hadn't
done
that.
but
no
court
has
drawn
the
distinction
between
previously-seen
and
previously-unseen
evidence
in
the
way
that
petitioners
would
draw
it
and
said
there
is
no
need
for
a
causal
relationship
in
the
case
of
previously-seen
evidence.
we
think
the
1st,
2nd,
4th,
7th
and
9th
circuits
have
reached
the
right
result
and
have
analyzed
the
issue
in
the
proper
way.
the
exclusionary
rule
is
designed
to
prevent
the
government
from
benefiting
from
violations
of
the
constitution.
that
is
why
the
chief
justice
said
in
nix
v.
williams,
the
exclusionary
rule
was
meant
to
put
the
government
in
the
same
position
it
would
have
occupied
if
no
illegality
had
occurred,
not
to
put
the
government
in
a
worst
position
than
if
no
illegally
had
occurred.
in
a
case
where
evidence
is
seen
during
an
unlawful
entry
and
is
later
seized
pursuant
to
a
valid
warrant,
it
is
only
if
there
is
a
causal
relationship
between
those
two
events
that
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
put
the
government
in
the
same
rather
than
a
worse
position.
the
exclusionary
rule
was
meant
to
prevent
the
government
from
exploiting
illegalities,
not
to
punish
the
government,
and
to
punish
society
by
the
exclusion
of
probative
evidence
in
every
case
in
which
there
is
an
illegality,
whether
exploited
or
not.
that's
the
lesson
of
wong
sun
and
segura
itself.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
the...
we
think
that
the
findings
of
the
lower
court
are
absolutely
sufficient
to
negate
any
possibility
of
a
causal
connection
in
this
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
obviously,
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
make
findings,
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
observe--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
on
page
28a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
court
said:
"this
is
as
clear
a
case
as
can
be
imagined
where
the
discovery
of
the
contraband
in
plain
view
was
totally
irrelevant
to
the
later
securing
of
a
warrant
and
the
successful
search
that
ensued,
as
there
was
no
causal
link
whatever
between
the
illegal
entry
and
the
discovery
of
the
challenged
evidence.
"
"we
find
no
error
in
the
court's
refusal
to
suppress.
"
we
think
that
that
is
an
absolutely-correct
reading
of
the
record,
given
the
findings
by
the
district
court.
one
finding
by
the
district
court--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
page
42a
in
the
middle
of
paragraph
u,
the
court
finds
that
"in
an
effort
to
apprehend
any
participants
who
might
have
remained
inside
and
to
guard
against
the
destruction
of
possibly-critical
evidence,
the
agents
made
a
forced
entry
of
the
building.
"
that
is
a
finding
directly
contrary
to
petitioner's
suggestion
that
the
reason
they
entered
was
to
search
for
marijuana.
that
point
was
argued
in
the
district
court,
that
they
were
looking
for
marijuana
when
they
went
inside.
the
district
court
found
otherwise.
the
district
court
went
on
to
find
that
the
warrant
was
not
vissiated
by
the
prior
illegal
search
which
is
also
a
finding
on
the
absence
of
causal
relation.
this
is
a
warehouse
that
had
been
under
surveillance
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
before
the
warrantless
entry
occurred.
at
the
time
the
warrantless
entry
occurred,
two
vehicles
that
had
been
seen
coming
out
of
the
warehouse
at
2:05
p.m.
had
been
stopped
and
found
to
be
full
of
marijuana.
as
mr.
randolph
said
in
his
argument,
there
was
already
a
suspicion
even
before
the
stopping
of
those
vehicles
that
this
warehouse
was
a
distribution
point
for
large
quantities
of
marijuana.
what
petitioners
are
suggesting,
even
though
they
didn't
suggest
it
in
the
lower
courts,
is
that
this
court
must
assume
that
that
warehouse
would
have
been
left
alone
if
no
warrantless
entry
had
been
made.
that
would
be
a
plausible
scenario
perhaps
in
either
of
two
circumstances.
it
would
be
a
plausible
scenario
if,
contrary
to
the
district
court's
findings,
the
officers
had
gone
into
the
warehouse
with
the
purpose
to
search
for
marijuana.
if
it
had
been
a
confirmatory
search
in
the
sense
that
the
decision
whether
to
get
a
warrant
was
contingent
on
what
they
found
in
the
warehouse,
then
there
would
be
a
causal
relationship.
there's
another
scenario
that
might
make
the
petitioner's
argument
plausible.
if,
when
they
went
in,
they
had
used
that
opportunity
to
physically
seize
the
evidence
in
the
warehouse,
then,
of
course,
it
would
be
plausible
that
they
didn't
at
that
time
have
an
intent
to
come
back.
for
example,
in
footnote
12
of
their
reply
brief,
the
petitioners
cite
some
cases
in
which
agents
made
exigent
circumstance
entries
on
the
premise,
seized
evidence,
and
didn't
come
back
later
with
a
warrant
to
get
it
again.
well,
of
course,
if
the
evidence
has
already
been
seized,
that
negates
any
inference
that
there
was
already
an
intent
to
go
get
a
warrant.
but
that's
not
this
case.
this
is
a
case
in
which
no
physical
seizure
of
the
evidence
took
place
while
the
agents
were
in
the
warehouse.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
answer
is
that
they
would
have
come
back
with
their
sweepers,
with
their
fingerprint
people.
they
would
have
looked
for
marijuana
residue.
they
would
have
looked
for
fingerprints.
they
would
have
looked
for
small
items
of
the
sort
that
would
not
be
uncovered
during
the
security
sweep
that
took
place.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
certainly
possible
to
imagine
hypotheticals
different
from
this
case
in
which
they
would
not
have
come
back,
but,
of
course,
in
segura,--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--of
course,
this
case
didn't
involve
a
search
for
evidence.
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
certain
exigent
circumstances--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--there
certainly
may
be
some
such
cases,
your
honor,
yes,
but,
again
in
segura,--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that
argument
could
have
been
made
in
segura.
if
that
argument
is
correct,
segura
should
have
been
decided
the
other
way.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
agree,
your
honor.
that's
why
we
distinguish
between
confirmatory
searches
in
which
the
purpose
is
to
decide
whether
to
go
get
a
warrant,
in
which
going
and
getting
a
warrant
is
at
the
time
of
entry
contingent
on
what
is
found
inside
because
of
the
officer's
state
of
mind,
and
other
kinds
of
searches
that
may
happen
to
confirm
what
is
found
inside.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
we
are
here
under
both
independent
source
and--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
we
think
it's
essentially
the
same
argument.
your
honor
may
differ.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we
do
think
that
inevitable
discovery
argument
means
it
has
to
be
inevitable,
yes.
but
inevitable
at
the
time
of
entry,
not
inevitable
contingent
on
some
hypothetical
future
event
that
did
not,
in
fact,
occur.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
that,
of
course,
depends
on
the
legality
of
the
initial
entry.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
which...
as
i
understand
the
plain
view
doctrine,
the
plain
view
doctrine
applies
when
agents
are
aware
they
have
a
right
lawfully
to
be.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
and
if
they
had
a
right
lawfully
to
be
in
the
warehouse,
then,
of
course,
the
plain
view
seizure
would
be
valid.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if
they
are
not
unlawfully
there,
as
assumed
in
segura
and
as
is
being
assumed
arguendo
in
this
case,
that's
when
the
question
of
independent
source
and
inevitable
discovery
arise.
one
must
assume
a
prior
invalid
action
in
order
to
get
into
a
question
of
causation,
questions
of
independent
source
and
inevitable
discovery.
again,
your
honor,
we
are
turning
to
the
question
of
whether
a
warrant
would
have
been
obtained
in
this
case
in
the
absence
of
the
assumedly
unlawful
warrantless
entry.
it
really
is
all
together
implausible
to
suggest
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
warehouse
would
have
been
left
alone
and
nothing
would
have
been
done
if
this
warrantless
entry,
this
warrantless
protective
sweep
had
not
occurred.
that
suggests
that
these
agents,
after
conducting
surveillance,
would
have
abandoned
their
interest
in
the
warehouse,
even
though
they
had
probable
cause.
as
i
say,
there
are
scenarios
in
which
that
would
be
plausible,
but
those
are
not
the
scenarios
in
this
case.
that
is
why
we
submit
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
not
remand
for
further
factual
findings,
because
the
inference
from
the
findings
that
have
been
made
that
the
warrant
would
have
been
obtained
is,
we
submit,
inescapable
in
these
facts.
contrary
to
petitioner's
submission,
we
submit
that
that
inference
is
sufficient
to
support
admission
under
the
independent
source
and
inevitable
discovery
doctrine,
and
we
submit
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
answer
is
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not
eliminating
all
the
deterrent
effect
because
it
remains
the
government's
burden
of
proof
to
show
a
lack
of
causal
connection
once
the
illegal
entry
is
established
or
is
assumed.
the
government
bears
the
litigation
risk
that
it
will
fail
in
that
burden
of
proof,
and
that
is
one
of
the
risks
brought
about
the
exclusionary
rule
that
doesn't
make--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
the
defense
can
contest
what
they
say
and,
indeed,
such
factors
as
whether
they
physically--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--but
such
factors
as
to
whether
they
actually
seized
the
evidence
during
their
entry
or
left
it
alone
and
immediately
went
and
got
the
warrant
bear
on
the
credibility
of
the
assertion
that
it
was
inevitable
from
the
start
that
a
warrant
would
be
obtained.
there
are
extrinsic
factors
that
can
be
used
to
test
the
credibility
of
such
an
assertion.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
is
a
reason
to
await
the
discovery
of
the
evidence,
but
we
will
admit
it's
not
an
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
in
the
precise
circumstances
you
pose,
that's
correct,
but
there's
nothing
novel
about
the
proposition
that
there
may
be
situations
in
which
the
exclusionary
rule
has
no
deterrent
effect.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
you
shouldn't
necessarily.
it
depends
on
how
strong--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
the
finder
of
fact
has
to
find
inevitably,
has
to
find
a
lack
of
causation,
and
that
bears
on--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it
would
make
a
difference
in
the
analysis.
it
might
be
admitted
anyway.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
on
a
sufficient
showing
of
the
inevitability,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
except
that
the
showing
of
inevitability
is
somewhat
undermined,
this
factual
question.
it
will
be
harder
for
the
government
to
carry
its
burden
of
proof
on
this
factual
question
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
because,
in
a
case
like
this,
in
which
a
brief
tour
was
made
and
nothing
was
seized,
that
tends
to
confirm
the
government's
assertion
that
the
plan
from
the
start
was
to
go
get
a
warrant.
in
a
case
in
which
they
go
in
and
start
seizing
things,
that
tends
to
suggest
that
they're
grabbing
what
they
can
while
they
may
and
they
haven't
thought
about
what's
going
to
come
later
or
they
haven't
made
any
decision
as
to
what's
going
to
come
later.
it
bears
on
the
factual
inference
made
by
the
district
court.
i
should
also
say,
justice
stevens,
in...
about
the
deterrence
question,
there's
nothing
new
about
the
proposition
that
there
are
situations
that
the
exclusionary
rule
just
doesn't
reach.
standing
is
a
good
example.
in
the
alderman
case,
the
opinion
of
the
court--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--in
cases
in
which
the
government
makes
a
sufficient
showing,
that's
right,
because
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
exclude
evidence
come
about
by
illegality.
it's
not
to
compensate
for
invasion
of
privacy.
that's
what
civil
remedies
are
for,
and
in
cases
in
which
there
is
no
causation,
the
evidence
is
not
going
to
come
about
by
exploitation
of
an
illegality.
there
has
been
an
illegality,
but
that
illegality
has
resulted
in
an
invasion
of
privacy,
not
in
the
seizure
of
evidence,
and
that's
why
a
civil
remedy
is
appropriate
in
that
case
and
an
exclusionary
remedy
is
appropriate
only
in
the
case
in
which
the
causation
element
can
be
established.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
