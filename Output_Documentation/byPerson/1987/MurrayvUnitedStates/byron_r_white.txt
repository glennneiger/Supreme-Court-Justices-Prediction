justice
white
was
there
that
in
this
case?
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
that
the
agents
wouldn't
have
gotten
a
warrant
if
they
hadn't
performed
an
illegal
search
before--
justice
white
--suppress
everything.
justice
white
how
about
the
findings
of
the
district
court?
can
you
point
to
something--
justice
white
--specific
in
those
findings?
justice
white
why
isn't...
i
suppose
if
there
had
never
been
an
illegal
entry
in
the
first
place,
but
then
a
valid
warrant
issues
and
they
go
into
the...
or
even
if
they
say
a
warrant
was
issued
to
discover
some
other
kind
of
evidence
and
they
go
in
the
warehouse
and
in
plain
view
is
some
marijuana.
now,
why
isn't
this
a
plain
view
seizure
in
this
case?
justice
white
why?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
all
right.
so,
you
just
get...
i
don't
know
what
inevitable
discovery
has
to
do
with
it,
though.
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
they
were
lawfully
there,
and
if
they
were
lawfully
there,
it's
a
plain
view
seizure.
whether
they
are
lawfully
there
may
turn
on
whether
their
entry
is
tainted
by
the
form
of
search.
