justice
stevens
but
is
it
not
correct
that
the
chief
justice
in
his
opinion
said
that
one
reason
that
there
will
be
a
deterrent
against
this
kind
of
activity
is
that
the...
whatever
evidence
they
discover
as
a
direct
result
of
the
entry
will
be
suppressed?
justice
stevens
yes.
may
be.
justice
stevens
you
don't
think
he
meant
that
it
would
automatically
be
suppressed?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
what
is
the
deterrent
then
if
it
won't
be
suppressed?
if
you
say
it
may.
of
course,
anything
might
be
suppressed.
i
don't
understand
his
reasoning
there
if
he
isn't
assuming
that
it
would
be
suppressed
on
the
facts
of
that
case.
justice
stevens
and
the
other
is
that
he
might
sue
the
police
officers.
justice
stevens
you
can
rely
on
those
here,
too,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
what
kind
of
sanction
would
you
say
would
be
appropriate
for
the
officer
who
fills
out
the
application
for
a
warrant
and
doesn't
tell
the
magistrate
that
they've
already
searched
the
place?
justice
stevens
so,--
--yes,
but
if
that
happened,
then
you'd
suppress
everything.
justice
stevens
he's
assuming
there
are
cases
in
which
you
draw
a
distinction
between
the
two.
i
don't
think
you
can
posit
a
case
where
you
do
draw
a
distinction
between
the
two.
between
the
seen
and
the
unseen
evidence.
justice
stevens
so
that
your
view
is
quite
different
from
the
chief
justice's
view
because
he
said
there
may
be
cases
where
you
must
draw
a
distinction.
justice
stevens
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
issue
of
determining
whether
there
was
a
causal
connection?
justice
stevens
and,
so,
if
there's
no
finding,
there
is
a
failure
of
proof
on
your
part?
justice
stevens
don't
you
have
the
burden
of
introducing
the
issue,
too?
i
mean,
if
he
raises
the
point,
then
you
have
the
burden
of
proof,
but
you
don't
have
the
burden
of
going
forward?
is
that
your
thought?
justice
stevens
and
there's
no
such
finding--
justice
stevens
--and
you
say
we
don't
have
findings
by
either
the
lower
courts
as
to
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
causal
connection
between
the
things
that
were
seen,
so
to
speak,
and
the
things
that
were
unseen?
justice
stevens
mr.
englert,
would
you
make
a
comment
on
the
hypothetical
that
mr.
randolph
raises?
lots
of
times,
i
suppose,
it's
possible
that
you
have
probable
cause
to
find
something
and
when
you
make
the
search,
you
don't
actually
find
it.
there's
a
difference
between
certainty
and
probable
cause.
what
is
your
view
about
the
scenario
that
would
have
taken
place
if
they
went
into
a
place
like
this
and
found...
did
not
find
what
they
expected
to
find?
justice
stevens
well,
what
if
they
were
looking
for,
say,
a
stolen
vehicle
rather
than
marijuana,
so
that
they
knew
it
was
either
there
or
it
isn't
there?
when
they
get
in,
they
just
don't
find
it.
do
you
think
they
would
then
come
back
anyway?
justice
stevens
presumably,
since
probable
cause
is
a
great
deal
less
than
certainty,
there
must
be
a
very
large
number
of
cases
in
which
there
is
probable
cause,
but,
yet,
the
search
is
unsuccessful.
now,
these
are
not
just
remote
possibilities.
it
must
happen
very
frequently.
justice
stevens
they're
searching
for
a
large
weapon
or
explosives
or
something
like
that,
and
you
don't
find
it,
is
it
not
true
that
they
probably
would
not
go
get
a
warrant
in
that
case?
justice
stevens
and
if
there
is
such
a
case,
then
is
it
not
true
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
application
for
the
warrant
was
inevitable
because
they
wouldn't
have
gotten
the
warrant
unless
they
found
what
they
were
looking
for?
justice
stevens
well,
segura
should
have
been
decided
the
other
way.
no
doubt
about
that.
well,
do
you
concede
that
their
state
of
mind
after
they
entered
is
at
all
relevant?
i
should
have
thought
the
proposition
is
whether,
at
the
time
they
entered,
they
had
an
intent
to
get
a
warrant
and
whether
a
warrant
at
that
point
would
have
been
obtained,
assuming
the
entry
had
never
occurred.
does
it
make
any
difference
to
your
case
whether,
after
they
entered,
they
would
not
get
a
warrant
because
they
know
that
there
is
nothing
there?
i
don't
see
how
that
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
the
entry
caused
a
later
warrant
or
not.
justice
stevens
you
are
right
that
it
doesn't
bear
on
the
causation
issue.
but
i
just
submit
to
you
that
you
are
trying
to
come
in
under
what
is
known
as
the
inevitable
discovery
issue
and
the
inevitable
discovery
means,
it
seems
to
me,
that
there
must
have
been
an
inevitable
probability
that
you
could
go
ahead
and
get
the
warrant.
but
you're
saying
you
wouldn't
if
you
didn't
find
anything.
justice
stevens
now,
you're
arguing
independent
source
then.
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
think
inevitable
discovery
requirement
means
that
it
has
to
be
inevitable?
justice
stevens
but
if
you
accept
your
facts
and
assume
you
can
make
them
even
more
clear,
you
had
an
assistant
u.s.
attorney
involved
in
these
decisions.
supposing
they
actually
drafted
the
warrant
application
before
they
broke
in
and
sent
some
people
out
and
they
had
very
strong
probable
cause
and
knew
it
was...
they
were
confident
they
would
get
the
warrant.
is
there
any
reason
then
to
await
the
actual
getting
of
the
warrant?
they
have
written
evidence
of
the
application
prepared
in
advance
and
they
all
sign
in
blood
that
we've
agreed
to
do
this
before
we
go
in.
justice
stevens
i
see,
but
the
exclusionary
rule
has
no
deterrent
effect.
you
have
other
reasons
like
civil
sanctions.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
you
say
you
also
might
run
a
risk
if
the
officers
would
seize
the
evidence
if
they
got
in
there
and
that
would
be
a...
but
why
logically
should
you
not
make
the
inevitable
seizure
argument?
if
they're
going
to
get
the
warrant
and
the
authority
to
seize,
why
should
you
suppress
the
seized
evidence?
justice
stevens
so,
then,
that
additional
sanction
you
mentioned,
you
really
are
not
maintaining.
justice
stevens
why
does
the
fact
it
might
have
been...
say
they
had
seized
the
marijuana
here
before
they
got
the
warrant,
why
should
that
make
a
difference?
would
it
make
a
difference
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
you
think
it
should
be
admitted
anyway,
don't
you,
because
it
is
inevitable
that
they
would
have
seized
it
if
they
had
gone
ahead
and
gotten
the
warrant?
justice
stevens
and
it's
exactly
the
same
showing
that
you
need
to
justify
the
entry.
justice
stevens
why?
justice
stevens
yes,
i
understand
it,
but
basically
what
you're
saying
is
we
should
not
rely
on
the
exclusionary
rule
for
the
deterrent
for
warrantless
entries
when
there's
(a)
probable
cause
and
(b)
intent
to
get
a
warrant
as
soon
as
it's
convenient
to
do
so.
the
exclusionary
rule
will
no
longer
have
a
part
to
play
in
those
warrantless
entries.
justice
stevens
mr.
randolph,
i
don't
understand
your
seizure
argument
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
agree
with
the
government
in
this
case,
that
inevitably
they
would
have
seized
it
as
well
as
seen
it,
and
i
think
they
had...
it
would
cure
the
illegal
seizure
much
as
it
cures
illegal
search.
