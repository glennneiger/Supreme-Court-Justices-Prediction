chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
86-995,
murray
against
the
united
states,
consolidated
with
86-1016,
carter
against
the
united
states.
mr.
randolph,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--the
court
didn't
addressed
the
problem
we
have
here,
did
it,
as
to
whether
the
stuff
that
was
seen
prior
to
the
securing
of
the
premises
should
be
suppressed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
does
confirmatory
mean,
mr.
randolph?
have
we
ever
used
it
in
any
of
our
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
the
fact
that
the
search
was
confirmatory,
is
that
a
vice
other
than
the
vices
you've
already
averted
to
in
your
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
randolph.
mr.
englert,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
you
refer
specifically
to
findings
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
findings?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i've
observed
them
to
make
findings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
mr.
randolph,
you
have
eleven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
property
found
means
looked
at
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
randolph,
what
if
they
open
a
window
and
see
it
and
then
they
realize
they
have
no
probable
cause
to
enter,
no
warrant,
do
you
think
they'd
still
have
an
obligation
to
go
in
there
because
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
think
they
should
go
in
and
seize
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
is
that
different
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
randolph.
the
case
is
submitted.
