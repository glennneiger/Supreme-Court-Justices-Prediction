mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
1st
circuit.
the
court
granted
certiorari
to
consider
a
question
whether
evidence
uncovered
during
a
warrantless
search
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
may
nevertheless
be
admitted
to
evidence
on
the
basis
of
the
inevitable
discovery
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
following
pattern
of
events
gives
rise
to
this
question.
in
this
case,
the
events
took
place
on
a
wednesday
afternoon
in
boston
in
april
1983.
officers
violated
the
fourth
amendment,
which
is
assumed
in
this
case,
by
entering
premises
without
a
warrant.
during
the
illegal
search
that
ensues,
they
discover
evidence.
they
prepare
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant.
the
affidavit
omits
the
fact
that
the
earlier
entry
and
what
they
found.
the
warrant
issues
and
the
officers
remove
the
evidence.
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
whatever
the
officers
find
during
their
illegal
entry,
whatever
they
discover,
has
to
be
excluded.
under
the
court's
decision
in
segura,
whatever
they
find
later
during
the
warrant
search
comes
in
and
may
be
admitted.
the
government
contends
that
nothing
should
be
excluded
from
evidence,
despite
the
unlawful
search,
and
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case.
the
facts
shall
summarize
as
follows:
by
noon
on
april
6th,
the
wednesday,
as
i
said,
in
1983,
a
joint
fbi/dea
investigation
was
on-going
involving
a
total
of
about
fifteen
agents.
before
1
p.m.
that
day,
the
agents
began
keeping
a
warehouse
in
south
boston
under
surveillance.
they
had
concluded
by
that
time,
and
even
earlier,
that
it
contained
marijuana.
the
building
was
located
on
the
corner
of
first
and
d
streets.
it
had
two
garage
doors
facing
first
street
and
a
black
steel
door
facing
d
street,
the
only
entrances
to
the
warehouse.
about
1:45,
agents
saw
a
white
truck
and
a
green
camper
pull
up,
go
into
the
warehouse.
a
few
minutes
later,
the
vehicles
left,
they
were
followed
by
some
of
the
agents
on
the
scene,
and
later
stopped;
one
on
the
massachusetts
turnpike,
another
in
dorchester,
both
of
the
vehicles
contained
marijuana.
in
the
mean
time,
many
of
the
agents,
at
least
seven,
had
assembled
at
a
parking
lot
about
one
mile
from
the
warehouse.
the
pier
restaurant
parking
lot.
with
them
was
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
the
two
agents
who
were
in
charge
of
this
investigation
and
a
dea
agent
named
keaney,
an
fbi
agent
named
cleary,
were
there.
they
saw
a
green
camper
pull
into
the
parking
lot,
arrested
its
occupant,
only
to
find
they
had
arrested
an
electrician
from
new
hampshire.
they
looked
through
the
vehicle
and
there
was
no
marijuana.
petitioners
then
drove
into
the
parking
lot
in
another
vehicle,
a
blue
van,
with
ladders
on
top.
they,
too,
were
arrested.
the
agents
looked
through
their
vehicle.
again,
no
marijuana.
several
minutes
later,
most
of
the
agents,
except
the
two
agents
in
charge,
keaney
and
cleary,
left
the
parking
lot.
they
headed
for
the
warehouse
and
converged
there,
met
there
with
several
other
agents,
three
at
least,
who
were
already
there,
as
i
said,
keeping
the
warehouse
under
surveillance.
after
walking
around
the
warehouse
and
announcing,
according
to
agent
kennedy,
"dea/fbi,
open
up.
"
one
of
the
agents
took
a
tire
iron
from
his
car,
broke
open
the
side
steel
door
and
entered.
the
immediate
entry
into
the
warehouse
was
through
a
small
office.
they
proceeded
through
the
office
into
a
large
bay.
four
vehicles
were
there.
one
of
the
vehicles,
a
camper,
a
scottsdale
camper,
had
twenty-five
bales
of
marijuana
in
it.
the
agents
looked
under
the
vehicles,
inside
vehicles,
went
around
the
warehouse,
found
no
one,
but
also
discovered
in
the
course
of
their
tour
approximately
270
bales
of
marijuana
strewn
around
the
floor
in
the
far
left
of
the
warehouse.
after
they
were
in
the
warehouse,
the
two
agents
at
the
parking
lot
drove
up.
they
also
took
a
tour
of
the
building
and
one
agent,
who
was
outside,
an
agent
newton,
and
had
been
posted
there
for
security,
was
allowed
to
come
in
and
he
went
inside.
i'd
like
to
freeze
the
frame
right
there.
stop
the
action.
because
i
think
what
you
see,
at
least
so
far,
is
a
search,
an
illegal
search,
that
is
at
the
heart,
the
core,
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it's
in
boston.
agents
break
down
the
door
of
a
warehouse.
they're
searching
for
smuggled
goods.
they're
accompanied
by
a
court
officer.
all
of
that
is
very
familiar
american
history
because
that
is
exactly
what
the
writs
of
assistance
allowed,
and
james
otis,
of
course,
gave
his
argument
more
than
200
years
ago,
which,
according
to
some
people,
including
john
adams,
lit
the
spark
of
the
american
revolution
to
stop
that
and
that's
why
we
have
the
fourth
amendment.
the
government's
argument
in
this
case
is
very
similar
to
the
attorney
general
of
england's
argument.
they
couldn't
get
a
warrant
because
if
we
did,
the
goods
would
be
removed,
and
i've
set
out
the
attorney
general
of
england's
argument
200
years
ago
as
precisely
the
same.
the
fact
that
the
agents
had
probable
cause
in
this
case
is
also
of
no
moment.
in
case
after
case
in
this
century
and
in
this
court,
many
of
which
are
cited
on
pages
32
and
33
of
our
brief,
the
court
has
held
"although
the
agents
had
probable
cause,
they
still
have
to
get
a
warrant
and
the
fact
that
they
possess
it
without
going
to
the
magistrate
is
of
no
moment.
"
"the
magistrate
is
to
interpose
his
judgment
or
her
judgment
between
the
police
and
the
citizens.
"
"more
than
that,
the
warrant
confines
the
ensuing
search
because
it
has
to
be
specific.
"
what
else
happened?
there
was
a
seizure
at
that
moment.
the
marijuana
that
those
agents
found
in
that
warehouse
was
seized.
there
are
several
reasons
for
that,
and
this
was
not
an
issue
in
the
district
court
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
government
has
raised
it
in
this
court
and
i'll
confront
it.
1.
seizure
is
defined
as
interference,
meaningful
interference,
with
possessory
interest.
we
had
ten
agents
go
into
a
warehouse,
break
the
door
down,
and
then
surround
the
warehouse,
as
i'll
get
to
in
a
moment.
their
purpose,
according
to
the
government,
was
to
prevent
the
removal
or
destruction
of
evidence.
that
is
interference.
more
than
that,
a
statute
which
i
did
not
cite
in
the
brief
but
have
informed
the
government
makes
it
clear
that
once
the
agents
find
contraband,
they
possess
it.
it's
the
property
of
the
united
states.
it's
in
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
and
they
must
seize
it,
with
or
without
court
order.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
under
segura,
what
they
have
done
at
most
is
engaged
in
a
reasonable
seizure
of
the
property,
and
also
under
mincey,--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
--i
think
segura
so
held,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
it
was
that
basis
on
which
the
court
said
"therefore,
there's
no
difference
between
securing
the
property
from
the
outside
and
going
in
and
staying
there
nineteen
hours.
"
but
our
proposition
is
there
was
a
search
here,
and
that
that
search
violated
the
warrant
clause
because
they
broke
the
door
down,
and
once
they
got
in
there,
then
our
position
is
that
the
evidence
that
they
find
has
to
be
suppressed
for
three
reasons,
which
i'll
get
into.
number
1.
if
it's
not,
then
all
the
incentive
is
there
to
conduct
a
warrantless
search
before
you
get
a
warrant.
they
had
nothing
to
lose.
number
2.
the
purpose
of
the
warrant
was
to
confine
the
search.
if
anything
they
discover,
whether
by
pulling
drawers
open
or
looking,
is
suppressed,
then
the
search
is
confined.
number
3.
and
i
use
the
government's
argument
and
this
court's
in
segura,
when
the
government
attorney
was
asked
what
is
there,
what
incentive
do
agents
have
when
they
go
on
premises
to
leave,
and
the
government
said
the
incentive
is
to
suppress
what
they
find
when
they're
inside,
and
if
they
stay
longer,
they
probably
will
find
something
more.
so,
that
gets
them
out.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
the
court
said
in
the
opinion
that
is
not
before
it,
i
want
to
be
precise
about
this,
"however,
because
the
court
of
appeals
suppressed
that
evidence
and
the
government
did
not
cross
petition,
however,
chief
justice
burger
and
justice
o'connor
in
a
separate
portion
of
the
opinion
relied
upon
the
suppression
of
the
evidence
found
during
the
warrantless
entry
as
the
reason
why
the
decision
in
that
case
would
not
undermine
the
exclusionary
rule.
"
as
i
said,
that
was
only
one
part
of
the
opinion.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
that's
correct.
they
did
not.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
well,
we
are
getting
into
the
realm
of
intent,
and
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
this
way:
the
government
has
made
the
argument
in
this
court
that
the
officers
were
contemplating.
what
they
were
contemplating
before
they
broke
the
door
down
was
getting
a
search
warrant,
and
that's
a
new
fact,
i
think,
in
this
case.
it
was
never
proposed
as
a
finding
by
the
government
and
there
is
testimony
which
we
quoted
in
the
reply
brief
that
the
agents
that
were
in
charge
of
this
investigation--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
--right.
that's
what
i'm
getting
to.
now,
the
question
is
what
rule
of
law
does
that
embody.
that
means
if
the
agents
had
decided
to
get
a
warrant
before
they
went
in
and
violated
it
under
the
government's
theory,
then
all
the
evidence
comes
in.
i
think
that
kind
of
a
law,
kind
of
a
rule,
under
the
fourth
amendment,
completely
destroys
the
warrant
clause,
and
here's
why.
first
of
all,
any
knowledgeable
officer,
if
the
court
so
holds,
as
he's
breaking
into
premises,
will
suddenly
have
an
on-rush
of
contemplation,
a
desire
to
get
a
warrant,
as
he's
walking
in
without
one.
the
purpose
of
the
warrant
clause
is
when
officers
have
a
desire
to
search
and
it
was
inevitable
this
warehouse
was
going
to
be
searched.
the
question
was,
was
it
going
to
be
searched
legally
or
was
it
going
to
be
searched
illegally.
and
the
purpose
of
the
warrant
clause
is
to
make
sure,
and
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
make
sure,
that
there's
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment.
so,
if
you
have
a
rule,
number
one,
that
says
whenever
you're
contemplating
and
you've
already
decided
to
get
a
warrant,
then
if
you
go
in
without
one
and
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
there's
no
consequence,
then
that
seems
to
me
to
be
completely
contrary
to
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
but,
then,
we're
getting
into,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
a
land
of
make-believe.
let
me
explain
why.
one
would
have
to
suppose
that
an
agent,
as
the
agent
is
going
into
the
premises,
not
knowing
for
sure
what's
in
there,
has
the
following
thoughts
going
through
their
mind.
i
am
going
to
get
a
warrant
and
i'm
going
to
carry
out
that
decision
no
matter
what
i
find
in
that
building,
and
if
i
go
inside
that
building
and
i
find
nothing,
it's
completely
empty,
nevertheless
i'm
carrying
out
that
decision.
i'm
going
to
get
to
a
magistrate,
i'm
going
to
swear
i
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
whatever
i
was
looking
for
is
there,
and
i'm
going
to
go
back
and
search
it,
even
though
i'm
not
going
to
find
it.
it
has
to
influence.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
and
the
consequence
of
that,
of
allowing
that
evidence
in
is
that
there's
no
deterrent
anymore
because
what
incentive
is
there
for
an
officer
who
knows
that
in
an
hour
or
two
hours,
you
can
go
get
a
warrant
or
maybe
his
colleagues
are
up
at
the
magistrate,
why
wait.
they're
intending
to
get
a
warrant.
we
might
as
well
go
in
right
now,
and
if
the...
suppose
the
magistrate
doesn't
issue
the
warrant
in
that
situation,
regardless
of
the
officer's
intent,
then
what
have
they
lost?
all
that
shows
is
they
never
had
probable
cause
and
couldn't
have
gotten
a
warrant
and
shouldn't
be
in
there
anyway.
more
than
that,
if
it's
the
intent
to
get
a
warrant
that
controls
in
this
case,
then
they
go
in,
the
search
is
unlimited.
it's
not
controlled
by
what
the
magistrate
says
you
can
search
for.
the
limiting
of
the
warrant.
so,
i
think
it
destroys
every
root
and
branch,
everything
that
warrants
were
designed
to
do,
if
this
is
allowed.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
government--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
--assumed
arguendo.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
i'm
sorry.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
i've
gotten
ahead
of
myself.
the
agents,
after
they're
inside,
there's
a
conference,
and
they
decide...
the
conference
is
to
go
to
get
a
warrant
at
the
courthouse
which
is
a
short
distance
away,
and
two
of
them
depart
and
eight
hours
later,
about
10:40
in
the
evening,
a
magistrate
signs
the
warrant.
the
agents
then,
who
were
still
at
the
warehouse
guarding
it,
immediately
go
back
in.
they
don't
even
know
what
the
terms
of
the
warrant
are.
they
receive
a
telephone
call
and
that's
admitted,
the
prosecutor
so
stipulated.
about
a
half
hour
later,
the
warrant
arrives
and
they
carry
off
within
the
next
twenty-four
hours
the
goods
that
they
found.
the
government
in
this
case,
in
addition
to
the
notion
of
inevitable
discovery,
is
now
saying
that
there
is
no...
that
there
is
an
independent
source.
there's
no
connection
between
the
illegal
search
and
the
evidence
that
was
sought
to
be
introduced
at
trial
and
was,
in
fact,
introduced.
i've
already
addressed
one
of
their
arguments,
one
of
the
reasons
is
well,
it
really
wasn't
seized
until
the
warrant
arrived,
and
i
think
there's
nothing
to
that.
the
other
argument
is,
look,
if
they
hadn't
searched
the
warehouse
illegally,
even
if
they
hadn't
done
that,
they
would
have
searched
it
legally.
that
argument,
i
think,
is
fallacious.
one
can
say
that
in
every
case
this
court
has
ever
decided,
suppressing
evidence
when
the
police
have
probable
cause
and
didn't
get
a
warrant.
the
fact
is
there's
only
two
ways
to
search.
one
is
with
a
warrant
and
one
is
without.
one
is
legally
and
one
is
illegally.
and
you
cannot
base
a
decision
on
the
following
that,
well,
even
if
we
didn't
do
it
illegally,
we
would
have
done
it
legally,
which
is
essentially
what
the
government's
argument
revolves
down
to,
and
it's...
i'm
reminded
of
this
when
i
was
coming
here
this
morning,
it's
like
the
warehouse
door
had
a
big
stop
sign
on
it,
and
it
said
"stop,
fourth
amendment",
and
the
police
go
through
it
anyway.
and,
then,
when
that's
found
out,
they
said,
wait
a
minute
now,
we
can
do
this
legally,
watch,
and
they
come
out
and
this
time
they
stop
at
the
door
and
get
a
warrant
and
go
through
and
duplicate
what
they
did
before.
now,
that
argument
wouldn't
persuade,
i
don't
think,
many
police
officers,
and
i
hope
that
the
argument
will
not
persuade
this
court
because
that
is
essentially
what
the
government's
arguing.
i
want
to
sum
up
and
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
by
saying
three
things.
i
think
the
government
here
has
come
close,
awfully
close,
to
confessing
error
in
this
case.
they
say
if
the
agents
intended
to
get
a
warrant
from
the
start,
then
this
would
be
a
different...
if
they
did
not
intend
to
get
a
warrant
from
the
start,
there's
no
indication
of
that,
this
would
be
a
different
case.
they
didn't
intend
it.
the
government
says
if
the
marijuana
was
seized
upon
the
illegal
entry,
then
maybe
it
should
be
suppressed.
it
was
seized.
the
government
says
if
the
search
was
confirmatory,
then
maybe
the
evidence
should
be
suppressed.
the
search
was
confirmatory.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
you
have
never
used
it,
your
honor,
and
what
it
means
in
this
situation
is
simply
that
the
agents
confirmed
their
suspicions.
they
only
suspected
marijuana
was
there
before.
they
got
inside,
they
confirmed
two
things
actually.
they
confirmed
that
there
was
no
one
there,
and
they
also
confirmed
that
the
evidence
that
they
were
seeking
was,
in
fact,
on
the
premises
that
they
had
broken
into.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
it's
part
and
parcel
of
my
argument,
chief
justice,
and...
but
the
government,
i'm
saying
the
government
has
gone
off
and
said
if
the
agents
had
a
confirmatory
intent
or
a
purpose,
then
we
would
agree
that
the
evidence
should
be
suppressed.
i'm
just
responding
to
the
government's
argument.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
i'm
not
sure
where
all
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
fit,
and
i
thought
that
was
in
the...
maybe
it
was
in
the
independent
source
argument.
i
may
be
wrong
about
that.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
never
maintained,
we
had
never
maintained
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
warrantless
search
of
the
warehouse,
the
warehouse
would
have
been
left
alone.
that's
not
our
proposition.
the
one
thing
that's
clear
in
this
case,
without
any
doubt
whatsoever,
is
that
warehouse
was
going
to
be
searched.
the
police
or
the
agents
had
probable
cause.
just
like
they
had
probable
cause
in
case
after
case
that
we
cited
on
page
32
to
34
of
our
brief.
question
was,
was
it
going
to
be
searched
legally
or
was
it
going
to
be
searched
illegally.
now,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
it
was
searched
illegally,
and
evidence
was
discovered,
marijuana.
the
government
says
there's
no
causal
connection
between
the
two.
why
not?
because
later
on,
they
got
a
warrant
and
searched
it
legally.
it's
like
saying
christopher
columbus
didn't
discover
america.
because
somebody
else
could
have
later
on.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
they
did
discover
the
evidence.
that's
the
causal
connection.
it's
discovery
of
evidence
during
the
course
of
a
constitutional
violation,
but
aside
from
all
that,
take
a
look
at
where
the
road
the
government
is
seeking
to
lead
the
court
down
and
the
shambles
it
would
make
of
fourth
amendment
law.
a
couple
examples.
a
case
i
argued
here
ten
years
ago,
chadwick.
the
trunk
in
boston
coming
out
of
a
car.
police
search
it
without
a
warrant.
the
court
suppressed
the
evidence
because
they
had
to
get
a
warrant.
but
under
the
government's
theory,
consider
this:
the
police
do
exactly
the
same
thing,
but...
and
nothing
changes
except
the
argument,
and
the
argument
will
be
it
was
inevitable
that
they
were
going
to
find
what
was
in
the
trunk.
why?
well,
every
time
we
take
property
back
that's
been
close
to
an
automobile,
we
do
an
inventory
search.
so,
it
was
inevitable
that
we
would
have
found
it.
or
take
chimel,
justice
stewart's
famous
opinion,
confining
the
scope
of
the
search
to
the
areas
within
the
immediate
control
of
the
person
arrested
and
not
allowing
an
arrest
to
serve
as
a
pretext
for
running
through
an
entire
house,
even
though
they
have
probable
cause.
that
case.
that
case
would
be
decided
differently
under
the
government's
argument.
the
government
could
say,
well,
the
fact
that
we
searched
the
entire
house
upon
the
arrest
is
of
no
consequence
whatsoever.
we
had
probable
cause
and
we
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
and,
in
fact,
agent,
go
get
one
now.
so,
all
this
evidence
shall
be
admitted.
again
and
again,
in
every
case,
that
could
happen.
it
is
a
self-fulfilling
prophecy.
the
warrant
is
obtained
not
for
authorization
to
enter
the
premises,
which
is
what
it
was
designed
for,
and
at
least
some
people
thought
we
fought
for,
it's
obtained
so
the
evidence
can
get
admitted
into
a
court
of
law
because
they've
already
been
inside.
now,
the
government
says
time
and
again,
that
the
evidence
wasn't
seized.
now,
i've
addressed
that
and
i
think
i
neglected
to
cite
the
statute
which
says
contraband
found
with
or
without
court
order
is
property
of
the
united
states
in
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
through
his
designees,
the
dea
and
the
fbi,
and
is
deemed
seized.
this
statute
is
21
usc
section
881(f).
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
i
would
think
so.
otherwise,
one
runs
into
the
following
situation:
if...
suppose
the
magistrate
didn't
issue
the
warrant
in
this
case,
suppose
the
magistrate
looked
at
it
and
said
there's
no
probable
cause
here,
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
issuing
that
warrant,
do
you
think
the
agents
would
have
then
have
said
oh,
close
the
door
and
leave,
here's
your
marijuana,
do
with
it
as
you
please,
we
don't
have
probable
cause?
no.
they
would
have
seized
it
anyway.
they
had
to.
they
had
an
obligation
to,
just
as
if
they
found
heroin
or
cocaine
or
anything
under
the
drug
control
statute.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
well,
if
they
look
in
the
window
and
see
it,
there's
certainly
a
probable
cause.
the
question
is
whether
they--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
--not
without
a
warrant.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
because
they
didn't
find
it
till
they
got
inside.
they
broke
through
the
door.
i
can
stand
outside
the
windows
of
any
government
building
in
washington
and
look
in
and
see
things,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
i
have
a
right
to
break
down
the
door
and
go
in,
and
that's
what
they
did
in
this
case,
and
that's
what
warrants
are
designed
to
stop.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
i
fully
agree,
justice
stevens.
my
only
point
is
they
are
using
this
argument
to
show
there's
no
causal
connection.
they're
using
it
in
their
independent
source,
no
causal
connection
part.
they're
not
using
the
argument
as
i
understand
it
in
their
inevitable
discovery.
the
two
are
different.
inevitable
discovery
is
really
a
hypothetical
independent
source
whereas
independent
source
means
you've
got
it
somewhere
else.
so,
i
find
myself
being
inconsistent
because
the
positions
of
the
government
are
inconsistent.
i'd
like
to
make
two
final
points.
the
arguments
that
we've
heard
here
today
from
the
government
are
not
new.
those
arguments
have
been
made
before
in
this
court,
and
they
have
been
made
very
vigorously
in
situations
that
were
far
more
compelling,
i
would
think,
than
this
case.
in
the
national
security
wiretap
case
and
in
katz,
the
government
argued
strenuously
that
it
should
be
permitted
to
get
after-the-search
warrants,
that
it
should
be
able
to
search
first,
get
a
warrant
later,
admit
the
evidence,
and
the
court
rejected,
particularly
in
the
u.s.
district
court,
in
the
stirring
opinion
by
justice
powell,
rejected
that
position
flat
out.
the
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
there
really
is
not
very
much
need
to
speculate
in
this
case
about
what
would
happen
if
you
unleash
agents,
police,
from
the
warrant
requirement,
from
the
constraints
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
one
doesn't
have
to
speculate.
the--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
--segura
can
rest
on
the
following
proposition,
that
what
was
not
seen
was
not
seized
within...
unreasonably
seized
within
the
apartment,
and
the
following
example--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph
--segura
does
not
cover
this
case.
segura
rested
on
the
independent
source.
the
warrant
was
an
independent
source
for
finding
things
that
remained
unseen.
segura
did
not
address
the
next
point,
although
justice
o'connor
and
chief
justice...
i'll
give
you
an
example
that
maybe
is
the
best
i
can
do.
if
the
police
had
gone
into
segura's
apartment
and
there
was
an
individual
hiding
in
a
closet,
i
don't
think...
a
secret
room,
i
don't
think
one
could
say
that
individual
had
been
arrested;
that
is,
seized
from
the
moment
they
were
there
and
the
nineteen
hours
they
remained.
therefore,
because
they
were
in
there
illegally,
there
was
no
connection
between
that
individual
and
police,
but
when
the
warrant
arrives,
they
break
down
the
secret
room
and
they
find
the
individual,
then
i
think
at
that
point
there
is
an
independent
source
so
long
as
the
warrant
itself
rested
on
probable
cause
before
the
entry.
i
think
that's
the
best
i
can
do,
but
when
they
find
things
illegally,
when
they're
in
there,
then
if
they're
not
suppressed,
then
we're
not
deterring,
we're
giving
an
incentive
for
illegal
entries,
we're
giving
an
incentive
for
searches
beyond
the
scope,
and
i
might
add,
i
might
add
that
even
the
illegal
entry
part
of
the
proposition
is
not
necessary
under
what
i'm
contending
here.
the
entry
could
be
legal.
for
example
in
the
chimel
case,
and
then
the
scope
of
the
search
is
wider,
and
the
government
would
still
come
back
and
say
inevitably
we
could
have
gotten
a
warrant.
the
last
points
i
wanted
to
make,
i
was
leading
up
to,
was
the
experiences
in
colorado
and
california.
in
the
majority
opinion
in
the
california
supreme
court
and
in
the
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
that
we
cited,
this
situation,
this
factual
situation
came
up,
and
both
the
majority
and
the
concurring
opinion
pointed
out
that
they
had
to
put
a
stop
to
it
because
it
had
become
standard
police
practice
to
go
in
before
the
warrant
arrived.
they
stopped
it.
california
had
the
same
experience.
they
had
initially
in
one
case
allowed...
accepted
the
government's
argument
here,
and
what
they
found
after
a
few
years
was
it
had
become
standard
police
practice,
and
i'd
also,
and
this
is
speculation,
i
admit,
but
one
has
to
wonder
why
suddenly
we
find
case
after
case
after
case
with
this
factual
situation
coming
up.
take
a
look
at
the
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
there
are
tons
of
them.
they
are
coming
out
of
the
woodwork
now,
and
there's...
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
reason
is
once
you
allow
this
to
happen,
once
you
allow
warrantless
illegal
searches
to
be
duplicated
by
a
search
later
and
that
allows
the
evidence
to
come
in,
then
what
you
will
find
inevitably,
inevitably,
is
that
searches
with
warrants
will
be
preceded
by
illegal
searches
without
warrants.
thank
you.
