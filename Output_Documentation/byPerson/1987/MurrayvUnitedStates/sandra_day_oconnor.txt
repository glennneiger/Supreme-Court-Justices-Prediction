justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
randolph,
the
courts
below
didn't
really
address
the
question
of
whether
the...
what
the
officers
saw
after
their
illegal
entry,
influenced
the
decision
to
get
the
warrant,
did
they?
justice
o'connor
and,
so,
really,
the
question
we
have
to
decide
is
if,
in
fact,
what
the
officers
saw
on
their
illegal
entry
did
not
influence,
if
it
did
not
influence
their
subsequent
decision
to
get
the
warrant,
must
the
evidence
be
excluded.
justice
o'connor
well,
that
wasn't
addressed
below,
and
i
think
we
need
to
deal
with
it
first
in
the
abstract.
if
the
proof
is
there
and
the
trial
court
finds.
justice
o'connor
i
don't
think
that's
the
extent
of
the
rule
that
is
suggested.
it's
a
question
of
if
the
officers,
in
fact,
had
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant,
and
if
what
they
see
after
the
illegal
entry
does
not
affect
their
decision
to
seek
a
warrant,
then
must
the
evidence
be
excluded.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
don't
follow
that
scenario
at
all.
the
question
only
arises
if,
in
fact,
they
get
a
warrant
and
go
back
and
try
to
seize
evidence
that's
offered
at
trial.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
englert,
you
wouldn't
fail
very
often
because
you
have
the
officers
there
to
testify
and
certainly
the
defense
can't
contest
what
they
say.
justice
o'connor
well,
they
don't
have
their
own
evidence.
all
they
can
do
is
say
to
the
court
or
the
jury,
don't
believe
the
officers.
