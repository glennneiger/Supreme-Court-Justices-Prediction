justice
scalia
mr.
randolph,
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
let's
assume
a
case
where
agents
believe
that
there
is
contraband
in
a
warehouse,
they
surround
the
warehouse
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
leaving
while
one
of
them
goes
to
secure
a
warrant.
have
they
already
effected
a
seizure,
a
warrantless
seizure?
justice
scalia
have
we
ever
said
that
that's
a
seizure?
just
surrounding...
you're
saying
it's
a
seizure
but
a
reasonable
one
because--
justice
scalia
mr.
randolph,
just
for
the
record,
we
didn't
hold
in
segura
that
surrounding
the
warehouse
or
even
going
into
the
warehouse
and
being
there
would
constitute
a
seizure.
justice
scalia
assumed
arguendo.
justice
scalia
big
difference,
and
we
found
that
even
if
it
had
been,
it
would
have
been
reasonable.
yes.
justice
scalia
i
think
they
say
that
only
for
their
first
argument.
i
think
the
inevitable
discovery
argument
would
continue
to
be
valid
regardless.
justice
scalia
is
it
clear
that
the
chief
justice's
"may"
is
gone
if
we
agree
with
you
in
this
case?
i
mean,
there
would
still
be
a
possibility
of
such
suppression
to
the
extent
that
the
fact
that
they
saw
certain
contraband
would
cast
doubt
on
whether
they
had
an
intent
to
get
a
warrant
in
the
first
place.
justice
scalia
mr.
englert,
would
you
just
say
a
word?
you've
covered
it
briefly,
i
guess,
but
i'd
like
to
hear
a
little
more
about
it.
whether
if
we
agree
with
you,
we
aren't
making
it
painless
for
the
government
to
behave
in
this
fashion?
i
mean,
let's
assume
we
agree
with
you
on
causality
and
all
of
that
but,
nonetheless,
the
exclusionary
rule
is
a
deterrent
and
are
we
eliminating
all
of
the
deterrent
effect
if
we
say,
you
know,
so
long
as
you
have...
can
convince
a
court
that
you
had
a
prior
intent
to
get
a
warrant
anyway,
you
have
nothing
to
lose
by
going
in
unlawfully.
justice
scalia
how
is
your
theory
consistent
with
segura?
why
is
segura
all
right
under
your
analysis?
justice
scalia
so,
unless
we
agree
with
you
that
there's
a
seizure
here,
then
segura
covers
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
second
consolidated
case
is
murray
versus
united
states
and
carter
versus
united
states
come
to
us
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
both
cases
arise
from
the
same
incident.
federal
agents
witnessed
petitioner's
drive
trucks
which
they
believed
to
contain
marijuana
in
and
out
of
a
warehouse
in
boston.
the
agents
eventually
stopped
the
trucks,
found
them
to
contain
marijuana
and
arrested
petitioners
and
their
accomplices.
the
agents
then
returned
to
the
warehouse
and
entered
it
without
a
warrant.
they
saw
in
plain
view
numerous
large
bales
of
marijuana
and
other
evidence
of
crime.
after
about
five
minutes,
they
left
the
warehouse
and
did
not
return
until
they
secured
a
search
warrant.
they
searched
the
warehouse
and
seized
the
evidence.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
evidence
seen
by
the
agents
during
the
initial
search
which
we
assume
was
illegal
must
be
suppressed
even
though
it
was
later
discovered
during
the
search
pursuant
to
the
warrant.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
need
not
be.
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
reaffirm
what
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
"independent
source"
doctrine
which
is
a
corollary
of
the
exclusionary
rule
where
evidence
is
discovered
illegally
but
is
later
rediscovered
pursuant
to
a
lawful
means
that
is
wholly
independent
of
the
unlawful
means,
the
evidence
should
not
be
excluded.
in
this
case,
that
means
that
if
the
information
gained
from
the
illegal
initial
entry
did
not
effect
either
the
agent's
decision
to
seek
a
warrant
or
the
magistrate's
decision
to
issue
a
warrant,
then
the
second
search
derived
from
a
genuinely
independent
source
and
the
evidence
is
not
excludable
because
we
are
not
convinced
from
the
record,
however,
whether
the
warrant
at
issue
here
was
independent
in
the
sense
we
have
described.
we
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
instructions
to
remand
to
the
district
court
to
make
this
determination.
