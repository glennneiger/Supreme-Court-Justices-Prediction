what
significance
do
you
give
to
the
sentence
on
page
a8,
contempt
is
quasi-criminal
and
requires
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
stevens
in
civil
contempt
proceedings
as
well
as
criminal?
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
final
question.
as
i
remember,
and
i
may
have
this
incorrectly
in
mind,
but
the
trial
judge
here
did
conduct
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
ability
to
pay.
justice
stevens
and
concluded
that
there
was
ability
to
pay
with
respect
to
at
least
a
portion
of
the
disputed
period.
does
his...
do
his
remarks...
it
is
not
clear
from
the
part
that
is
quoted
in
your
brief.
do
his
remarks
indicate
where
he
thought
the
burden
of
proof
was,
which
way
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
went?
in
other
words,
if
he
said
in
so
many
words,
i
find
the
evidence
to
convince
me
and
it
is
not
equally
balanced,
i
am
not
relying
on
any
presumptions,
i
find
on
the
facts
here
that
this
man
had
an
ability
to
pay,
and
i
therefore
hold
him
in
contempt,
it
seems
a
little
strange
to
be
arguing
about
all
this
argument
about
presumptions.
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
what
i
am
really
asking
is
whether
in
the
actual
decision
of
this
case
did
the
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
actually
have
any
impact
on
the
outcome.
justice
stevens
may
i
pursue
justice
o'connor's
inquiry
with
a
hypothetical?
supposing
a
state
differently
from
all
other
states
passed
a
statute
saying
that
the
negligent
operation
of
a
motor
vehicle
shall
be
a
crime.
and
it
said,
(1)
you
can
go
to
jail,
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
but
also
have
a
separate
proceeding
that
the
person
thereby
injured
by
proof,
just
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
was
hurt
by
the
negligent
operation,
after
he
proves
a
crime
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
he
can
get
damages.
would
that
comport
with
the
fifth
amendment?
they
call
it
a
crime
and
they
say
the
private
litigant
gets
a
remedy
on
the
basis
of
it
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
does
the
fact
they
call
it
a
crime
mean
that
winship
applies?
justice
stevens
yes,
the
statute
says:
negligent
operation
of
the
vehicle
is
a
crime.
and
it
may
be
proved.
the
crime
may
be
proved
in
a
civil
proceeding
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
and,
if
you
get
a
jury,
you
instruct
them
that
having
done
this
is
a
crime
and
the
consequence
of
the
crime
is
you
have
got
to
pay
damages
to
the
plaintiff.
the
fact
that
they
call
it
a
crime,
in
your
view,
i
take
it,
would
require
all
these
other
protections.
justice
stevens
no.
what
i
am
saying
is
what
a
state
calls
the
proceeding
may
not
be
binding
on
us
in
interpreting
the
federal
constitution.
that's
what
i
am
saying.
justice
stevens
but
do
you
say,
though,
that
the
california
rules
applicable
to
this
kind
of
proceeding
should
be
judged
by
the
same
standards
that
apply
to
similar
rules
that
produce
similar
consequences
in
other
states
except
they
don't
call
it
a
crime.
justice
stevens
so,
our
case
pertains
only
to
california?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
in
this
very
case,
if
this
man
came
up
with
the
money
that
is
in
arreared
and
paid
it
in
the
court
or
paid
it
for
his
children's
support,
would
he
not
immediately
get
out
of
jail?
justice
stevens
and
what
i
am
saying
is
if
he
makes
the
past
payments,
he
won't
go
to
jail,
if
he
complies
with
the
order.
justice
stevens
so,
it
is
clear
that
this
order
in
other
jurisdictions
would
be
treated
as
a
coercive
and
a
civil
contempt.
justice
stevens
see,
you
are
suggesting,
i
think,
in
my
hypothetical
example
about
a
negligence
case,
if
a
state
not
only
called
it
a
crime,
but
also
said,
"we
will
appoint
counsel
and
we
will
give
the
defendant
the
privilege
of
not
getting
on
the
stand,
but
the
only
remedy
is
you
pay
damages.
"
you
would
say
that
having
given
some
constitutional
rights
to
a
proceeding
that
is
labeled
criminal
means
all
other
criminal
rights
must
go
with
it.
justice
stevens
well,
it
comes
from
california
or
my
hypothetical
state's
mistaken
belief
it
was
compelled
to
do
so
by
the
federal
constitution.
justice
stevens
they
say
it
was
based
on
the
federal
constitution
and
that's
why
they
do
it.
it
is
the
fact
that,
(a)
they
call
it
criminal;
and
(b)
they
think
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
they
had
to
do
it.
does
that
mean
that
we
must
agree
with
them
that
it
is--
justice
stevens
--what
else
do
you
have
in
this
case?
you
have
california
classifying
this
as
criminal
proceeding
and
giving
a
lot
of
rights
to
the
defendant.
justice
stevens
it
is
a
crime
because
they
call
it
a
crime.
justice
stevens
no.
the
state
also
identifies
certain
sanctions
that
require
that
then
there
are
rights--
justice
stevens
--yes,
they
are
because
the
defendant
here
carries
the
key
to
the
prison--
justice
stevens
--yes,
but
it
could
also
say,
"you
are
going
to
jail
for
three
years.
"
"i
don't
care
whether
you
make
restitution
or
not.
"
justice
stevens
but
if
he
does
that,
then
i
think
everyone
would
agree
that
is
the
equivalent
of
a
criminal
procedure.
justice
stevens
so
the
example
would
have
to
be
they
made
it
a
felony
but
they
way
the
only
remedy
for
committing
this
felony
is
an
injunction
or
a
cease
and
desist
order.
if
they
did
that
would
your
position
be
just
as
strong?
justice
stevens
but
i
think
you
have
agreed
that
california
could
solve
this
problem.
instead
of
coming
here
with
their
lawsuit,
they
could
have
gone
to
the
supreme
court
and
said,
we
want
a
new
rule
defining
this
species
of
contempt
the
same
way
every
other
state
does.
justice
stevens
if
that
is
true
and
they
want
to
keep
this
burden
of
proof,
they
can,
no
matter
what
we
decide,
they
can
say
as
a
matter
of
california
law
we
are
still
going
to
require
that
the
burden
of
proof
on
this
issue
be
placed
on
the
other
party.
justice
stevens
no,
no,
no,
i
mean
they
could
take
your
position,
which
you
say
they
have
now.
justice
stevens
what
i
am
suggesting
is,
if
you
should
lose
this
case
in
this
court
on
the
federal
theory,
they
could
still,
as
you
say
as
a
matter
of
california
policy
this
is
the
result
they
want,
they
could
easily--
