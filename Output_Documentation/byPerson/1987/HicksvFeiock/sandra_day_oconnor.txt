justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
capizzi,
the
california
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
california
statutes
make
this
contempt
proceeding
criminal
in
nature.
justice
o'connor
now,
i
guess
california
is
entitled
to
determine
that
for
itself
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
so
is
it
a
matter,
is
it
a
question
of
federal
law
for
purposes
of
answering
whether
the
federal
constitution
is
violated?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
you
don't
really
want
us
to
get
in
there,
do
you,
and
say
that
the
california
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
as
a
matter
of
california
law?
are
we
likely
to
do
that,
and
can
you
give
me
examples
of
where
we
have
done
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
why
would
we
want
to
do
that
if
it
is
a
question
of
federal
law
for
purposes
of
the
federal
constitutional
question?
you
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
your
brief
arguing
this,
and
i
had
a
hard
time
understanding
whether
you
seriously
thought
we
were
going
to
overturn
the
california
court
on
a
question
of
what
the
california
law
is.
justice
o'connor
but
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
california
law
puts
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
the
respondent.
i
understood
your
brief
to
say
that
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
california
law.
justice
o'connor
again,
you
don't
want
us
to
decide
that,
do
you?
justice
o'connor
well,
rylander
involved
a
situation
where
only
the
burden
of
production
shifted.
justice
o'connor
mr.
schwartzberg,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
california
court
of
appeals
did
ultimately
was
to
say
that
the
california
statute
as
applied
here
was
invalid
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
justice
o'connor
so
is
it
not
also
a
question
of
federal
law
whether
this
statute
is
indeed
civil
in
nature
or
criminal
for
purposes
of
answering
the
federal
constitutional
question?
justice
o'connor
no?
i
would
have
thought
perhaps
it
was,
that
if
we
are
going
to
say
the
federal
constitution
strikes
it
down
because
it
is
criminal
in
nature,
that
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
whether
this
thing
is
criminal
in
nature
for
federal
purposes.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
schwartzberg,
what
about
a
case
like
shillitani
v.
the
united
states
which
at
least
indicates
that
we
are
free
to
examine
the
purpose
of
the
contempt
proceeding
and
characterize
it
as
civil
in
this
instance
because
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
the
payment
of
the
money.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
that
is
perfectly
all
right
if
california
wants
to
do
that.
the
problem
is
that
we
have
a
california
court
that
has
rested
its
holding
on
the
federal
constitution.
now,
we
can
decide
that
issue,
i
suppose,
and
leave
california
free
to
call
it
whatever
it
wants
and
impose
whatever
requirements
it
wants
as
a
matter
of
california
law.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
schwartzberg,
isn't
the
california
procedure
california's
response
to
the
uniform
reciprocal
support
law
requirements?
justice
o'connor
well,
there
is
a
uniform
act
as
you
know
designed
to
enable
parents
with
custody
of
a
child
to
obtain
child
support.
justice
o'connor
and
each
state,
including
california,
has
responded
to
that
by
having
provisions
such
as
this
for
contempt
proceedings,
for
non-payment
of
child
support.
justice
o'connor
and
isn't
this
california's
participation
in
that
scheme?
justice
o'connor
well,
1209.5
is
what
we
are
dealing
with.
justice
o'connor
and
there
is
an
indication,
is
there
not,
in
that
uniform
act
that
these
proceedings
are
civil
in
nature
for
purposes
of
the
uniform
act
and
are
designed
to
coerce
the
parent
who
is
not
making
the
payments
to
make
the
payments.
that
is
the
idea
of
the
uniform
act;
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
would
it
be
more
accurate
to
say
they
have
dealt
with
contempt
proceedings
as
a
matter
of
california
law
as
quasi-criminal?
would
that
be
a
little
more
accurate,
maybe?
justice
o'connor
well,
don't
you
suppose,
mr.
schwartzberg,
that
because
one
of
the
consequences
of
this
coercive
proceeding
may
be
imposition
of
a
jail
term
that
a
state
as
a
matter
of
state
law
might
want
to
build
in
extra
protections,
such
as
a
higher
standard
of
proof.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
capizzi,
is
it
true
as
your
opponent
says,
that
in
california
the
jail
is
imposed
only
as
punishment,
not
as
future
coercion?
justice
o'connor
so
he
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
california
law?
