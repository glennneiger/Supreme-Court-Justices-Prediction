justice
white
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
ruled
clearly
enough
that
the
burden
of
proving
the
ability
to
pay
is
on
the
prosecution.
justice
white
as
a
matter
of
california
law.
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
convince
us
of
that,
but
i
thought
that...
i
didn't
read
your
brief
and
disagree
especially
with
that.
i
just
thought
that
you
thought
that
an
inference
of
the
ability
to
pay
could
be
drawn
from
that.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
you
are
just
saying
that
the
statute
says
that
the
prosecution's
burden
is
satisfied
when
you
prove
the
things
that
you
just
mentioned.
justice
white
did
your
brief
argue
that
this
statute
shifted
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
ability?
i
thought
you
just
said
it
shifted
the
burden
of
production.
justice
white
what
about
your
brief?
justice
white
but
the
burden
of
proving
ability
rests
on
the...
remains
on
the
prosecution.
justice
white
well,
you
can't
do
it
both
ways.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
we
have
got--
--you
are
talking
about
proving,
not
producing
evidence.
you
keep...
do
you
say
that
the
burden
of
proving
it
is
also
on
the
defendant?
you
do
say
that
in
your
brief,
don't
you?
you
say,
as
an
affirmative
defense
he
not
only
has
to
go
forward,
but
he
has
to
prove
that
he
can't
pay.
yes
or
no?
justice
white
could
i
ask
you,
mr.
schwartzberg,
if
we
disagree
with
you
and
say
that
california's
notion
about
whether
this
law
is
criminal
or
civil
doesn't
bind
us
and
we
decide
that
we
will
treat
it
as
civil,
do
you
lose?
justice
white
why?
justice
white
yes.
all
right.
justice
white
well,
yes,
but
the
court
of
appeal
didn't
give
short
shrift
to
the
notion
that
this
is
the
kind
of
a
proceeding
in
which
shifting
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
unconstitutional.
justice
white
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
we
just
aren't
entitled
at
all
to
ask
whether
or
not
this
is
close
enough
to
a
crime
to
trigger
these
protections.
justice
white
don't
be
fearful.
justice
white
--you
have
your
own
fifth
amendment.
justice
white
you
can't
apply
it
differently?
justice
white
but
if
a
judge
says,
you
haven't
paid,
therefore
you
got
jail,
and
he
goes
to
jail,
if
he
then
comes
up
with
his
past
payments,
he
gets
out.
justice
white
that
is
it.
justice
white
that's
the
difference.
justice
white
yes,
but
how
about
the
judge?
justice
white
if
he
puts
him
in
jail
for
not
having
paid
for
a
term,
he
may
not
let
him
out
just
because
he
comes
up
with
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
reasons
stated
in
opinion
on
file
in
the
hicks
case,
86-787,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
california
is
vacated
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
justice
kennedy
did
not
participate
in
the
case.
