mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
associate
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue,
contrary
to
a
number
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
were
filed
in
this
case,
i
would
suggest,
is
rather
narrow,
and
i
would
suggest
it
has
almost
no
national
importance.
what
we
are
here
to
decide
is
the
interpretation
of
a
very
specific
california
statute
which
affects
a
civil
contempt
in
the
criminal
venue
for
only
california
makes
that
definition.
what
i
would
suggest,
however,
is
that
the
significance
of
this
debate
concerns
almost
a
century
of
california
jurisprudence
concerning
civil
contempt.
what
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
rigs
which
this
court
in
boykin
versus
alabama
has
applied
to
criminal
cases,
which,
if
this
court
adopts
the
position
of
the
petitioner,
will
eviscerate,
will
essentially
vacate.
those
rights
are
self-incrimination,
both
the
right
not
to
have
to
testify
and
the
right
not
to
be
called
as
witnesses,
the
right
to
counsel
in
california,
and
i
would
suggest
a
right
which
is
perhaps
more
fundamental
than
those
rights
in
boykin
versus
alabama,
that
is
the
right
to
have
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
each
and
every
element
of
the
charge
as
contained
in
the
case,
this
court's
case
of
in
re
winship.
i
would
suggest
that
whether
1209.5
violated
the
fifth
amendment
involves
three
questions.
the
first
question
is,
does
1209,
which
is
the
general
scheme
for
contempts
in
california,
define
a
crime
with
the
element
of
the
ability
to
pay.
second,
if
it
does,
may
this
court
redefine
that
definition
of
a
crime
to
suit
the
court's
federal
interpretation
of
what
a
civil
contempt
is.
and
finally,
does
it
offend
the
fifth
amendment
if
it
is
a
crime?
i
think
that
the
answer
to
whether
1209
defines
a
crime
in
california
is
an
unequivocal
yes.
in
fact,
all
the
court
needs
to
do
is
to
turn
to
a
case
which
was
decided
in
the
1940s
called
bennet
versus
superior
court,
and
i
would
merely
quote
the
first
line
of
the
third
paragraph
on
page
210,
where
the
court
says,
"contempt
of
court
is
a
specific
criminal
offense.
"
now,
they
get
that
from
mcclatchie
versus
superior
court,
which
is
at
119
cal.
they
get
that
from
in
ex
parte
gould,
which
is
at
99
cal.,
both
1800s
california
supreme
court
cases.
now,
one
of
the
questions
that
the
court
asked
mr.
capizzi
was,
why
is
it
that
the
court
of
appeal
dealt
in
sense
with
such
short
shrift
with
the
question
of
whether
it
was
criminal
or
not,
and
the
answer
is
simple.
they
knew
what
it
was.
and
there
wasn't
any
need
to
have
any
particular
extended
analysis
of
that
issue
because
every
court
of
appeal
knows
what
it
is.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
i
would
concede
that,
yes.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
no,
justice
o'connor,
no
more
than--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
this.
if,
for
whatever
reason,
the
federal
government
had
no
murder
statute,
and
then,
in
fact,
let
us
assume
that
murder
on
the
federal
level
was
never
a
crime,
but
california
chose
to
treat
murder
as
a
crime,
a
felony,
and
they
had
a
statute
that
was
similar
to
that
in
martin
versus
ohio,
i
don't
think
this
court
would
have
any
trouble
striking
that
statute
down,
as
violating
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
i
don't
know
how
to
reconcile
that
with
california,
and
i
think
california
would
have
trouble
reconciling
it
with
shillitani.
it
is
the
same
reason,
i
think,
that
the
supreme
court
in
culver
city
tried
to
make
it
clear
that
california
was
not...
i
think
the
problem
here
is
that
the
legislature
used
the
label
"civil".
the
fact
is
that
the
courts
have
been
calling
it
a
"crime".
not
criminal
in
nature,
not
a
criminal
action,
but
a
crime
in
california.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
i
think
the
difficulty
with
that
is
that
we
are
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse.
i
think
that
what
the
court
of
appeal
said
was
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
crime.
a
crime
no
different
than
any
misdemeanor
or
felony
in
the
state
of
california.
and
their
conclusion
was
that
once
you
had
it
as
a
crime,
then
the
decision
such
as
this
court's
decision
in
rylander
do
not
have
any
effect.
and
then
that,
in
essence,
once
you
determine
this
is
a
criminal
act,
a
crime
punishable
as
a
crime
in
california,
that
this
court's
opinions
then
presuppose
that
various
rights
inure.
and
one
of
those
rights
is
the
fifth
amendment.
and
what
i
would
suggest
to
the
court--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--not
only
that,
but
i
would
go
one
step
further.
and
what
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
and
i
tried
to
present
it
in
my
brief,
which
is
that
california
has
a
very
unusual
legislative
scheme
which
is
that
we
have
166,
which
is
a
specific
penal
statute
governing
contempt
of
court
and
it
covers
the
same
act,
the
same
exact
act
that
is
prosecuted
here.
the
difference
between
1209
and
criminal
intent
in
166
is
that
only
the
people
in
the
state
of
california
can
bring
a
166
action,
but
a
civil
litigant,
in
other
words,
a
custodial
parent,
typically,
the
mother,
can
hire
counsel
and
bring
a
civil
contempt
which
is
a
criminal
action.
and
for
that
reason,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
california
supreme
court
in
culver
city
and
going
all
the
way
back
to
gould
said
there
are...
all
these
contempts
are
contained
in
different
places
in
our
legislative
scheme,
but
they
are
all
the
same
crime.
they
just
carry
different
kinds
of
right.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
well,
i
am
having
a
little
bit
of
trouble
with
the
analogy
because
i
am
not
entirely
certain
as
to
whether
the
courts
are
determining
that
the
civil
cause
of
action
is
itself
a
crime.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
i
would
be
less
than
frank
if
i
told
the
court
i
really
can
answer
that
question.
i
can't
because
i...
in
essence,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
a
private
prosecutor
can
come
in
and
obtain
damages
for
a
crime.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
i
hope
that
this
does
not
devolve
into
a
semantics
debate
because
i
don't
think
that
when
we
say
we
are
calling
it
a
crime
that
that
is
all
we
are
doing
and
that
it
is
not
a
crime
in
fact.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
i
don't
think
that
they
have
anything
to
do
with
each
other.
i
just
don't.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
yes.
and
that's
why
i
say
i
think
that
contrary
to
some
of
the
amicus
who
are
concerned
about
the
national
ramifications
of
this,
i
don't
think
they
have
any.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
if
the
california
court's
interpretation
is
unambiguous
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
this
may
only
involve
an
administrative
penalty,
whether
it
is
loss
of
license,
loss
of
privilege,
loss
of
money
or
jail,
i
think
that
if
the
california
court
says
that
in
california,
that
act
is
a
crime,
then
i
think
this
court,
not
bound
to
accept
that
determination,
in
effect,
i
think
this
court
must
apply
those
federal
constitutional
guarantees
which
apply
to
a
criminal
act
within
the
context
of
this
court's
decisions.
so,
i
would
concede,
for
instance,
that
this
court
does
not
require
counsel
in
every
criminal
proceeding,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
in
those
criminal
proceedings
where
the
court
does
require
counsel.
in
other
words,
where
the
penalty
is
not
de
minimis
that
counsel
has
to
be
applied
in
that
proceeding.
and
what
i
would
suggest,
if
we
look
at
this
case
backwards,
if
the
court
notes
that
california
courts
have
traditionally,
since
1893,
applied
and
felt
compelled
to
apply
federal
constitutional
rights
to
civil
contempts,
the
answer
is
that
they
must
know
that
it
is
a
crime.
and,
in
fact,
there
are
no
cases--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--because
the
courts
have,
since
1893,
defined
it
as
a
crime
and
have
treated
it
as
a
crime.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
well,
i
am
not
suggesting--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--yes.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
that
the
cases
have
always
defined
this
as
a
crime
because,
as
the
courts
say,
the
ultimate
result
is
punishment.
and,
in
fact,
petitioner
likes
to
call
this
coercive.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
these
proceedings
result
in
substantial
periods
of
jail
time.
and
whether
that
jail
time
comes
up
front
or
whether
it
comes
at
the
end
of
a
probationary
period
where
the
respondent
still
does
not
comply
with
the
court's
order,
and
in
fact
the
burden
of
proof
becomes
less
in
a
probation
situation
than
it
does
in
a
normal
criminal
proceeding--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--well,
california's
response
as
to
what,
justice
o'connor?
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
yes.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
yes.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
well,
the
1209.5
may
be,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
original
1209
statute
which
presents
a
contempt
remedy
is
not--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--yes.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
there
is
no
question
about
that,
but
that
act
does
not
supercede
1209.
and
1209
is
a
crime.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
i
would
say
that
the
courts
when
they
get
to
the
issue
of
what
species
this
is,
whether
it
is
criminal
or
civil,
have
used
a
number
of
different
labels
to
govern
it.
and
that
is
why
i
suggested
a
moment
ago
to
justice
scalia
that
one
of
the...
apart
from
looking
at
the
direct
language
of
the
courts
to
determine
whether
california
considers
this
a
crime
is
to
use
deduction
and
work
backwards.
and
that
is
to
look
at
what
the
courts
have
done
and
the
only
way
you
can
conclude
that
a
defendant
on
a
criminal
action
or
a
contempt
action
in
california
has
a
right
to
counsel,
which
most
states
don't
provide,
has
a
right
to
fifth
amendment
privileges
most
states
don't
provide.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
but,
justice
o'connor,
i
would
agree
with
you
if
i
could
find
in
the
cases...
and
i
have
read
them
over
and
over,
again...
any
reference
either
to
california's
own
constitutional
provisions
which
govern
the
fifth
amendment
which
govern
the
right
to
counsel.
the
truth
is
that
they
all
relate
back
to
the
fifth
amendment.
and,
in
fact,
in
in
re:
witherspoon,
which
was
decided
by
the
same
court
of
appeal
which
decided
in
re:
feiock,
the
court
of
appeal
again
noted
that
this
was
a
criminal
proceeding
and
based
upon
supreme
court
language
from
1893
concluded
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
action
or
a
contempt
action
had
a
right
not
to
be
called
as
a
witness
and
that
that
was
compelled
not
by
california's
constitution,
but
by
the
fifth
amendment.
the
leads
me,
obviously,
to
the
next
step
which
is
that--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--all
right.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
there
is
absolutely
no
distinction
in
the
procedural--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--criminal.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
yes,
in
fact,
when
the
court
looks
at
city
of
culver
city
v.
superior
court,
essentially,
the
petitioners
in
culver
city
stand
before
the
court
asking
them
to
tell
them
what
kind
of
contempt
this
is
because
they
are
obviously
looking
at
other
jurisdictions
and
recognizing
that
depending
on
what
kind
of
a
contempt
it
is,
they
get
different
rights.
and
the
supreme
court
said,
"we
don't
care
what
you
call
it,
because
it
is
all
the
same.
"
now,
that
may
sound
like
alice
in
wonderland,
but
the
courts
have
essentially
eviscerated
any
distinction
between
civil
and
criminal
contempt,
the
traditional
forms.
they
discuss
what
they
are.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
they
are
not
blind
to
that.
but
when
we
get
down
to
the
procedural
niceties
of
what
a
contempt
is,
there
is
no
question
that
the
courts
in
california
treat
it
as
a
crime.
it
is
a
misdemeanor
because
it
is
not
punishable
by
more
than
a
year
in
county
jail.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
well,
first
of
all,
he
is
not
in
jail
and
never
was.
he
was
placed
on
probation.
and,
essentially,
the
probation
grant
ordered
him
to
do
two
things.
it
ordered
him
to
make
future
payments
on
penalty
of
going
to
jail
and
it
ordered
him
to
make
past
payments
on
penalty
of
going
to
jail.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
it
is
clear
that
essentially
through
the
minority
of
his
children's
lives,
if
he
never
misses
a
payment
he
will
not
go
to
jail.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
correct.
and
i
have
conceded
that
in
my
briefs.
and
that
is
why
i
say
that
i
think
that
california
has
chosen
because
of
the
threat
of
jail
to
call
it
a
crime.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
no,
not
based
upon
what
you
just
said.
depending
upon
where
the
genesis
of
those
rights
comes
from.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
well,
if
you
assume
it
is
erroneous
then,
obviously,
i
lose.
but
i
don't
assume
that
their
decision
was
erroneous.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
well,
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
sure.
because
it
is
a
crime.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
but
that
is
always
the
predicate.
isn't
that
always
true
for
any
wrongful
act?
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
well,
then
maybe
we
ought
to
make
it
clear.
this
is
a
crime.
the
sanctions
in
this
case
are
no
different
than
in
any
other
crime.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
and
so
does
every
other
criminal
defendant
in
california.
if
i
go
out
and
commit
a
robbery
in
california,
and
i
am
convicted
of
that
robbery,
the
penalty
is
either
probation
or
prison.
a
court
could
place
me
on
probation
and
could
stay
the
imposition
of
that
prison
sentence
and
if
i
am
a
good
boy
for
three
years
on
that
probation
grant,
i
will
never
see
a
day
of
time.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
and
so
can
they
under
the
civil
contempt
statute.
that's
the
analogy
i
want
to
break.
under
the
civil
contempt
statute,
there
is
no
obligation
that
the
trial
court
place
the
contemptor
on
probation
and
give
him
another
chance.
the
court
can
simply
say,
"off
to
the
hoosegow".
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
but
we
don't
define
whether
a
matter
is
criminal
after
we
find
out
what
the
sentencing
is
when
the
state
has
already
said
that
it
is
criminal.
and
that
is
the
problem
we
are
having.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
yes.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
i
lose
because
i
would
concede
that
under
rylander
and
usury
that
the
inferences,
the
burden
shifting
that
this
statute
accomplishes
do
not
offend
the
fifth
amendment
in
civil
matters.
i
would
concede
that,
and
i
have
conceded
that
all
along.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
let
me
go
a
little
bit
further
here
and
indicate
to
the
court
this.
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
this
case
presents
by
the
petitioner
is
essentially...
comes
out
of
some
for
the
same
questions
as
the
court
was
asking
mr.
capizzi,
and
that
is
do
we
essentially
allow
petitioner
to
relitigate
the
definition
of
state
law
before
this
court
when
they
have
essentially
lost
that
opportunity
in
the
courts
below?
what
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
is
that
these
issues,
if
the
court
looks
through
the
original
briefs
that
were
filed
in
this
case,
the
court
will
notice
two
things.
petitioner
never
argued
to
the
court
of
appeal
that
this
was
not
a
crime.
and
number
two,
they
never
argued
to
the
court
of
appeal
that
as
an
element
of
that
crime
we
add
ability
to
pay.
essentially
they
went
to
the
court
of
appeal
and
they
argued
that
1209.5,
notwithstanding
these
two
assumptions,
did
not
offend
the
fifth
amendment,
and
perhaps
that
is
why
you
have
the
court
of
appeal
providing
short
shrift
to
what
we
are
now
arguing
amongst
ourselves.
the
fact
is
that
petitioner
has
also
argued
in
their
brief,
and
i
have
had--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--no,
because
they
knew
from
the
outset
that
they
were
dealing
with
a
crime
in
california,
and
once
they
had
that
as
a
predicate,
then
the
only
other
question
that
they
had
to
resolve
was
whether
the
wording
of
1209.5
offended
the
fifth
amendment,
and
they
didn't
have
any
trouble
reaching
that
conclusion
either.
and
the
reason
we
know
that
they
wouldn't
have
any
trouble
is
because
essentially
this
shifts
everything
onto
the
defendant.
we
know
that.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
i
would
be
fearful
to
use
the
word
entitled,
but
i
would
hope
to
argue
to
the
court--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--i
would
hope
to
argue
to
the
court
that,
yes,
the
answer
is
is
that
this
case
is
very
similar
in
some
respects
to
runi.
i
mean
i
just...
i
see...
my
view
is
that
what
the
court
is
being
asked
to
do
is
to
rewrite
the
opinion
but
i
think
that
the
answer
has
to
remain
the
same.
my
belief
is,
and
i
think
that
the
cases
support
it,
and
in
fact
in
the
reply
brief
that
petitioner
filed
just
last
week
essentially
petitioners...
i
consider
their
central
argument
to
be
on
page
9
that
this
court
must
define
the
subject
matter
of
a
statute
solely
in
federal
terms.
if
that
is
true
then
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
if
the
federal
government
in
49
states
make
a
wrong
a
civil
cause
of
action,
providing
for
injunctive
relief,
let's
say
pouring
1,000
gallons
or
sulfuric
acid
down
a
drain,
they
make
it
a
civil
wrong,
they
allow
for
injunctive
relief
to
stop
it
from
happening,
and
damages
to
punish
the
wilful
or
the
wrongdoer
for
what
he
did,
and
california
thinks
that
it
is
more
important
to
protect
its
citizens
on
its
water
quality
because
we
don't
have
any
water
in
california,
and
so
they
make
it
a
felony.
essentially
what
i
see
petitioner
arguing
is
that
he
would
come
here
and
say
it
is
not
a
crime,
because
nobody
else
makes
it
a
crime,
and
perhaps
it
wasn't
a
crime
under
common
law.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
i
don't
know.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
california
chooses
to
make
something
criminal,
and
we
are
getting
back
to
the
semantic
argument,
i
don't
know
how
to
get
out
of
it,
and
this
is
the
problem
i
think
you
have
seen
in
our
briefs,
if
they
make
something
criminal,
does
the
definition
of
a
crime
only
flow
from
the
punishment,
and
i
don't
know
that
the
answer
to
that
is
true,
because
there
are
many
acts
in
society
which
may
be
labeled
a
crime
which
perhaps
don't
even
carry
the
punishment.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
justice
stevens,
they
did,
and
they
got
one
vote.
i
mean,
i
think
that
is
why
we
are
here,
and
i
think
the
answer
is
that
since
1893
the
legislature
has
not
known
what
this
is,
they
have
seen
various
rights
being
compelled
by
the
fifth
amendment.
you
don't
have
to
be
phi
beta
kappa
to
figure
out
that
must
mean
it
is
a
crime,
and
they
haven't
amended
the
statute
of
1209,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
they
are
quite
content
with
what
it
is.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
i
don't
think
they
can
do
that
as
long
as
the
fifth
amendment
exists,
but
i
think
what
they
can't
do--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--they
don't
need
to.
we
have
already
essentially
eviscerated
the
law
in
california,
but
what
i
would
suggest
is
that--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--no
question,
your
honor.
i
hope
my
client--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--well,
we
do,
but
i
think
that
our
courts
are
going
to
be
less
inclined
to
utilize
it
in
the
near
future.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
no,
i
don't
think
that.
i
think
that
there
is
a
movement
of
the
court
to
utilize
independent
test
grounds
in
a
far
more
judicious
manner
than
have
been
used
in
the
past.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
and
i
would
suggest
that
does
not
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
absolutely.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
correct.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
there
is
no
question.
the
only
concern--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--the
only
concern
i
have
is
that
i
think
that
petitioner
is
going
to
argue
to
this
court
two
minutes
is
that
merely
facing
that
jail
sentence
is
going
to
scare
these
people
into
paying
their
money,
and
that
is
what
makes
it
coercive,
but
the
same
argument
is
true
that
that
is
supposed
to
stop
crime,
because
if
we
know
we
might
go
to
jail
if
we
are
caught,
somehow
crime
won't
occur
and
we
know
that
that
is
baloney
so
it
is
not--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--well,
i
haven't
made
it
because
of
the
difficulty
in
grappling
with
how
the
california
courts
go
back
and
forth
between
the
definition
of
what
is
a
civil
versus
criminal
contempt.
it
is
always
criminal.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
yes.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
i
would
venture
to
say
that
most
judges
attempt
the
rod
before
they
put
them
in
jail,
and
the
answer
is,
yes,
most
defendants
are
placed
on
probation
just
as
i
would
venture
to
say
that
most
criminal
defendants
in
the
traditional
criminal
sense
are
placed
on
probation
for
first
and
second,
maybe
sometimes--
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
--no,
not
in
california.
that
is
it.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
you
just
do
your
time.
mr.
richard
lynn
schwartzberg
you
do
your
time.
and
when
you
get
out...
now
you
can
always
obviously
as
for
a
modification,
and
you
can
hold
up
a
certified
cashier's
check
in
front
of
the
judge
and
beg
that
he
now
comes
back
and
modifies
your
probation,
but
it
is
not
a
situation
where
the
judge
says
the
orange
county
jail
is
across
the
street,
mr.
defendant,
why
don't
you
go
over
there,
and
when
you
get
the
money,
give
me
a
call?
it
doesn't
happen
that
way.
obviously,
i
have
just
a
few
moments,
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
this.
everybody
is
going
to
concede,
just
as
the
argument
made
by
mr.
capizzi
in
the
beginning,
that
these
are
children
involved,
and
obviously
we
have
custodial
parents
who
need
the
money.
excuse
me.
i
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
