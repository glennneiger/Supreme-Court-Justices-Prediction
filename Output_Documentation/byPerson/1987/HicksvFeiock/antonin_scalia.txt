justice
scalia
but
it
is
up
to
california
to
decide
what
it
is
coming
with
a...
i
mean,
that
is
a
purposive
test,
and
it
is
california's
purpose.
if
california
says
that
it
is
criminal,
who
are
we
to
say
that
it
isn't?
justice
scalia
you
are
arguing
that
it
doesn't
matter
what
california
said.
you
are
arguing
that
it
doesn't
matter,
and
i
am
saying
if
it
is
a
purposive
test
you
are
urging
upon
us,
it
does
matter.
what
is
california's
purpose?
if
california's
purpose
is
criminal,
then
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
as
far
as
that
issue
is
concerned.
i
agree
with
you.
i
think
that
california
has
not
said
that.
justice
scalia
it
has
applied
certain
protections
that
are
normally
applicable
in
a
criminal
context.
but
they
can
also
do
that
if
they
want.
justice
scalia
that
is
a
different
issue.
you
are
arguing
what
california
has
done.
i
am
asking
why
it
should
be
true,
the
other
point
that
you
say,
that
it
doesn't
matter
what
california
has
done,
that
even
if
california
has
called
it
criminal,
you
urge
upon
us
that
we
are
not
bound
to
accept
that,
and
i
don't
see
how
that
follows
at
al.
it
seems
to
me
we
are
bound
to
accept
it.
justice
scalia
what
was
the
procedure
that
was
involved
there
that
we
said
was
not
necessary?
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
now,
you
are
urging
here
that
what
is
not
necessary
is
not
only...
not
only
the
burden
of
persuasion...
not
only
the
burden
of
initiation
of
the
evidence,
production
being
placed
on
the
plaintiff,
but
also
the
burden
of
persuasion.
so
if
i
understand
your
case
correctly,
it
is
that
although
this
individual
should
not
be
liable
for
the
payments
unless
he
can
afford
them,
although
that
is
part
of
the
case,
if
the
court
can't
make
up
its
mind,
if
it
is
unclear,
i
don't...
if
the
court
finally
concludes
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence,
i
cant
really
tell
whether
he
can
afford
these
payments
or
not,
the
court
will
then
send
him
to
jail.
that
is
what
you
are
urging.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
could
take--
justice
scalia
--you
don't
say
that.
justice
scalia
mr.
capizzi,
whether
california
decides
to
or
not,
and
whether
you
argue
it
here
or
not,
i
had
the
impression...
i
don't
know
which
of
the
briefs
i
got
it
from,
that
most
states
do
place
the
burden
on
the
defendant,
not
just
for
production
but
of
persuasion.
is
that--
justice
scalia
--that
is
correct.
justice
scalia
i
assume
that
to
some
extent,
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
must
depend
upon
what
the
federal
test
for
criminality
is.
if
the
federal
test
for
criminality
is
purpose,
if
whether
the
purpose
of
the
penalty
is
to
coerce
or
to
punish
and
if
the
state
says:
our
purpose
in
applying
these
penalties
is
to
punish,
it
would
be
very
hard
for
us
to
say,
"no,
you
are
wrong,
california.
"
"your
purpose
is
not
to
punish.
"
california
is
certainly
dispositive
as
to
what
its
purpose
is.
so,
it
would
depend
on
what
test
we
are
applying;
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
could
you
tell
me,
mr.
schwartzberg,
could
you
tell
me,
because
it
makes
a
difference
to
my
answer
to
the
question
we
are
discussing
why
california
has
said
it
is
a
crime?
have
they
said
it
is
a
crime
because
it
is
a
punishment?
justice
scalia
as
opposed
to
a
coercion?
is
that
the
reason
they
have
said
it
is
a
crime?
justice
scalia
before
you
get
there.
justice
scalia
do
the
california
courts
make
any
difference
between
an
order
in
a
case
like
this
which
says,
the
defendant's
fault
in
the
court
and
the
court
says,
"unless
you
make
these
payments
that
are
due,
you
will
go
to
jail.
"
"and
you
will
sit
there
until
you
come
up
with
the
payments.
"
that
seems
to
me
coercive.
does
it
make
any
distinction
between
that
and
a
situation
where
the
person
who
has
failed
in
the
past
who
makes
payments
comes
before
the
court
and
the
court
says,
"because
you
have
not
made
these
payments
in
the
past,
you
are
going
to
jail
for
three
months.
"
is
there
any
distinction?
justice
scalia
both
of
them
are
called
coercive.
justice
scalia
criminal.
justice
scalia
mr.
schwartzberg,
what
about
this
as
a
way
of
out
of
your
semantical
box.
anything
that
you
go
to
jail
for
is
a
crime.
in
fact,
this
is
what
i
thought
our
law
reads
like.
if
it
is
a
proceeding
that
sends
you
to
jail,
it
is
a
criminal
proceeding,
unless
the
purpose
of
sending
you
to
jail
is
just
to
force
you
to
do
something.
now,
that
means
forcing
you
to
do
something
after
you
are
in
jail,
so
that
i
can
send
you
to
jail
until
you
pay
up
the
money
that
is
due
or
until
you
perform
some
act
that
you
are
supposed
to
perform.
that
is
civil.
justice
scalia
that
is
right.
justice
scalia
what
is
here
is,
you
are
going
to
jail
for
not
having
paid
previously.
justice
scalia
and
that,
if
you
call
that
coercive,
then
every
criminal
penalty
is
coercive.
that
is
to
say,
you
are
coerced
not
to
kill
people
by
knowing
that
if
you
kill
somebody
you
will
go
to
jail.
justice
scalia
that
couldn't
be
what
we
mean
by
coercive.
justice
scalia
why
don't
you
make
that
argument
to
us?
that
is
not
one
that
you
made.
justice
scalia
do
most
of
these
proceedings
arise
in
the
fashion
that
this
one
is--
justice
scalia
--that
is,
the
defendant
has
said
you
haven't
made
payments
in
the
past
and
therefore
go
to
jail?
or
do
most
of
them
come
up,
you
know,
we
are
going
to
send
you
to
jail
until
you
make
up
past
payments?
justice
scalia
the
sentence
itself,
before
its
suspension,
which
is
what
we
are
arguing
about,
the
sentence
itself
was
a
sentence
or
having
failed
to
make
past
payments.
now,
that
is
coercive,
to
be
sure,
just
as
much
as
life
imprisonment
for
murder
is
coercive.
it
induces
you
not
to
commit
a
murder,
and
this
would
induce
him
to
make
the
payments.
it
is
coercive
in
that
sense,
but
that
is
not
what
we
mean
by
coercive.
we
mean
you
have
the
key
to
the
jail
in
your
pocket,
and
that
wasn't
the
case
here,
was
it?
justice
scalia
i
am
talking
about
the
original
sentence.
it
is
the
sentence
that
we
are
concerned
about,
not
the
suspension
of
the
sentence.
