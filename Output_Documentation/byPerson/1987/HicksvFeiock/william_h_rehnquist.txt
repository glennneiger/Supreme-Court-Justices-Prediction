h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
cecil
hicks,
district
attorney
for
orange
county,
california,
acting
on
behalf
of
alta
sue
feiock
versus
phillip
william
feiock.
mr.
capizzi,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
present
population
of
orange
county?
do
you
know,
mr.
capizzi?
chief
justice
rehnquist
two
million.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
capizzi,
i
am
looking
at
page
a6
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
where
you
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeal,
and
i
am
looking
at
the
second
full
paragraph
on
the
page,
the
second
sentence,
where
its
says,
"our
supreme
court
recently
discussed
the
problem
raised
by
the
use
of
presumptions
in
criminal
cases
in
people
against
roder.
"
now,
does
the
court
of
appeal
opinion
have
any
more
discussion
than
that
of
why
it
considered
this
a
criminal
proceeding
rather
than
a
civil
proceeding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
have
there
been
other
cases
from
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
have
said
this
kind
of
proceeding
is
a
criminal
rather
than
a
civil
proceeding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
roder
wasn't
a
contempt
case,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
capizzi.
we
will
now
hear
from
you,
mr.
schwartzberg.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
california
that
has
a
statute
that
says,
for
negligently
driving
while
drunk,
you
can
have
your
license
revoked,
your
motor
vehicle
operator's
permit
revoked,
and
the
california
courts
say,
"well,
gee,
this
is
pretty
tough
on
the
motorist.
"
"we
think
it
is
a
criminal
proceeding.
"
and
then
we
talk
about
presumptions
and
what
the
burden
of
proof.
now,
can
this
court
if
a
california
court
says
one
of
those
procedural
aspects
is
invalid
under
federal
constitution,
can
we
not
reexamine
to
see
whether
or
not
this
meets
the
definition
of
a
"crime"
for
some
of
our
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
how
does
one
"know"
that
it
is
a
crime?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that's
all
it
takes?
you
don't
want
to
get
into
a
semantical
debate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schwartzberg.
mr.
capizzi,
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
capizzi.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist

opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
no.
