mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
this
is
a
case
that
will
determine
whether
mr.
feiock
and
the
feiocks
of
this
country
may
sit
on
their
hands
and
defy
with
impunity
valid
court
orders
to
provide
support
for
their
minor
children.
this
case
originated
in
the
state
of
ohio
when
alta
sue
feiock,
the
mother
of
respondent's
three
children,
petitioned
the
ohio
courts
for
support
under
the
uniform
reciprocal
enforcement
of
support
act,
uresa.
the
petition
was
forwarded
to
california,
where
the
orange
county
district
attorney's
office
in
turn
filed
a
petition
with
the
california
superior
court
seeking
an
order
for
support.
following
a
hearing
an
order
for
support
was
entered
directing
payment
of
$50
per
month
per
child,
and
that
was
in
fact
a
reduction
from
the
original
$75
per
month
per
child
which
had
been
ordered
at
the
time
of
the
divorce
some
eight
years
earlier.
the
orange
county
district
attorney's
office
was
acting
in
this
case
not
as
the
public
prosecutor,
but
as
the
attorney
for
alta
sue
feiock
for
the
sole
purpose
of
gaining
the
support
due
her
and
her
children.
this
was
not
a
welfare
case.
there
was
not
an
effort
to
recoup
welfare
moneys.
there
was,
however,
an
interest
in
assuring
that
mrs.
feiock
would
not
be
a
welfare
recipient,
but
more
importantly,
this
case
represents
a
strong
and
fundamental
interest
that
the
state
has
in
assuring
minor
children
that
they
shall
have
the
support
that
is
due
them.
the
children
have
always
had
a
special
place
in
our
system,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
in
matters
of
child
support.
after
the
order
was
entered,
over
the
next
12
months
mr.
feiock
the
respondent,
paid
three
months,
but
for
the
other
nine
months
he
sent
not
one
thin
dime.
he
was
cited
for
contempt,
and
in
the
concept
hearing
the
petitioner
herein
relied
on
california
code
of
civil
procedure
1209.5.
with
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
35,000
family
support
matters
in
the
active
cases
of
the
orange
county
district
attorney's
office,
it
is
essential
that
reliance
can
be
made
on
a
statute
such
as
1209.5.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
something
in
excess
of
two
million.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes.
of
course,
that
is
the
35,000
cases
are
all
types,
the
litigation,
the
enforcing
reciprocal
cases
from
other
states,
those
that
have
enforcement
orders,
and
the
criminal
cases
that
are
filed
in
that
connection.
there
just
aren't
sufficient
resources
for
even
a
public
agency
to
pursue
cases
such
as
this
without
reliance
on
the
statute
involved
in
this
case,
and
certainly
if
a
public
agency
doesn't
have
the
resources,
the
private
individual
who
often
times
seeks
to
assert
their
own
support,
enforcement
of
their
own
support
orders
individually
couldn't
even
begin
to
pursue
those
on
their
own.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
it
can
place
whatever
label
it
chooses
on
a
case,
and
this
case
the
court
below
did
term
the
case
criminal.
i
would
submit
that
the--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--i
think
that
unquestionably
it
is
and
be
that
as
it
may
i
would
submit
that
the
court
below
was
wrong
in
terming
this
case
criminal
even
under
california
law.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
well,
i
think
the
court
has
always
looked
to
the
highest
court...
this
court
has
looked
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state
in
determining
what
the
state
law
is.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
we
merely
meant
to
set
the
record
straight,
and
point
out
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
there
are
still
two
types
of
contempt
in
california,
civil
and
criminal,
but
that
is
absolutely
correct.
as
far
as
the
constitutional
analysis
is
concerned,
it
doesn't
matter
what
label
california
puts
on
it.
otherwise
a
state
could
deprive
this
court
of
determining
in
what
instances
the
constitutional
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
will
or
will
not
apply.
now,
i
suppose
we
could
decide
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
for
federal
purposes
this
has
the
characteristics
of
a
civil
proceeding,
but
that
wouldn't
mean
that
california
when
it
went
back
couldn't
treat
it
as
something
else
for
its
purposes
and
under
the
california
constitution.
that's
true.
california
could
do
that.
but
they
haven't
done
that
in
this
case.
the
courts
have
repeatedly
said
that
there's
a
distinction
between
civil
and
criminal
contempt,
and
the
california
supreme
court
repeatedly
over
the
years
has
said
that
civil
is
to
protect
the
rights
of
litigants
and
criminal
is
to
vindicate
the
dignity
or
authority
of
the
court,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--california
has
not
said
that
it
is
criminal,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
yes,
justice
blackmun,
that
is
correct.
they
have
continued
to
draw
the
distinction
between
civil
and
criminal
contempt.
one
is
punitive,
criminal,
coercive,
is
civil.
they
have
extended
the
procedural
safeguards
otherwise
applicable
in
a
criminal
case
to
the
civil
contempt
proceeding.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
if
california
should
suggest,
justice
scalia,
that
in
a
civil
case
where
there
are
punitive
damages
those
are
penal
in
nature,
as
they
have
said
in
contempt
proceedings,
the
potential
of
a
jail
sentence
is
penal,
and
because
punitive
damages
are
potentially
penal,
we
are
going
to
extend
the
procedural
safeguards
of
a
criminal
case,
not
because
they
are
constitutionally
required,
but
because
as
a
state
we
are
going
to
extend
those
rights
in
the
civil
case.
thus
we
would
has
we
have
in
the
contempt
setting,
have
a
description
of
these
civil
cases
as
quasicriminal
or
criminal
in
nature
because
we
have
extended
procedural
safeguards
otherwise
available
in
criminal
cases,
and
then
respondent
would
come
before
you
and
say,
because
these
are
criminal
in
nature
we
have
extended
the
safeguards
of
a
criminal
case,
the
libel
case
in
which
we
are
seeking
punitive
damages,
that,
too,
is
criminal.
the
tort
case
where
we
are
seeking
punitive
damages,
that,
too,
is
criminal.
the
bad
faith
insurance
case
where
we
are
seeking
punitive
damages,
that,
too,
is
criminal,
and
that
would
deprive
this
court
of
determining
when
and
in
what
setting
the
constitutional
provisions
of
the
due
process
clause
are
to
apply,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
appropriate
test
is
to
analyze
what
the
hearing
is
substantively.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no.
i
would
submit
that
it
is
lacking
in
analysis
as
to
why
it
considered
it
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no.
in
fact,
the
roder
case
did
not
say
a
contempt
proceeding
is
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
it
was
not
a
contempt.
it
involved
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
involving
a
presumption
and
prima
facie
case.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that
is
what
the
california
courts
have
required
for
in
excess
of
100
years.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
in
civil
as
well
as
criminal,
and
that
is
why
civil
contempt
proceedings
because
they
have
the
potential
for
a
jail
sentence
if
the
coercive
order
is
violated,
they
have
been
given
in
civil
contempt
proceedings
many
of
the
procedural
safeguards
that
would
otherwise
be
available
to
a
criminal
defendant,
and
as
a
result,
over
the
100
years
or
so,
the
civil
contempt
proceedings
have
been
referred
to
as
quasi-criminal
and
criminal
in
nature,
but
that
doesn't
make
them
criminal
substantively,
and
as
this
court
has
said
in
shilitani
versus
united
states,
that
we
are
going
to
look
at
the
substance,
not
the
procedure
by
which
the
order
for
contempt
came
about.
shillitani
was
a
case
under
rule
42,
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
as
justice
harland
pointed
out
in
footnote
3
in
a
dissenting
opinion,
but
it
called
attention
to
the
record
below,
the
judgment
and
commitment
was
for
guilty
of
criminal
contempt
but
this
court
went
beyond
the
procedural
aspects
of
it
and
looked
at
the
matter
substantively,
and
because
the
order
of
two
years
in
jail
or
until
purging
oneself
of
contempt
by
testifying
before
the
grand
jury
was
the
order,
it
was
concluded
that
it
was
coercive
and
not
subject
to
the
procedural
aspects
of
a
true
criminal
case.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
in
shillitani?
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
it
was
the
jury
trial--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--no,
we
are
not,
justice
scalia.
we
are
urging
that
since
this
is
a
civil
case,
the
determination
of
whether
the
statute
meets
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
should
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
a
civil
rule,
and
in
a
civil
context.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
the
court
expressed
that,
and
again--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--but
it
misstated
california
law,
justice
white.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
the
statute
points
out
that
if
there
is
an
order--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--there
is
knowledge
of
the
order--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--and
there
is
a
violation,
it
hasn't
been
paid,
that
that
is
prima
facie
evidence
of
contempt,
and
even
if
we
are
to--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--that
is
correct,
and
that
is
consistent
with
an
early
california
supreme
court
case,
in
re
mccarty,
which
likewise
said
those
are
the
three
elements
of
contempt.
in
that
case
it
was
an
alimony
case,
but
there
should
be
no
difference
for
that
analysis
between
the
alimony
case
and
the
child
support
case,
and
that
was
the
rule
in
california
for
a
number
of
years.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
the
court
below--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--our
brief
expresses
that
it
shifts
to
the
respondent
the
burden
of
production.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
the...
again--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--the
california
supreme
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
inability
to
pay
is
an
affirmative
defense.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
and
as
an
affirmative
defense
the
respondent
has
the
burden
of
producing
evidence.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
justice
scalia,
what
we--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--the
court
of
appeals
said--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary.
it
is
a
civil
case,
and
as
a
civil
case
either
a
burden
of
production
or
a
burden
of
proof
is
appropriate,
and
the
statute
places
this
case
in
much
the
same
position
if
not
identical
position
as
the
circumstances
this
court
addressed
in
rylander
versus
united
states.
the
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
no,
i
don't
believe
we
do.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
it
is
a
civil
case,
and
regardless
of
whether
it
is
the
burden
of
persuasion
or
the
burden
of
production,
there
is
a
rational
connection
between
the
proven
fact
and
the
presumed
fact.
i
would
submit,
however,
assuming
just
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
this
were
a
criminal
case,
that
the
statute
would
meet
the
heavier
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
that
is
required
in
the
criminal
case.
it
is...
if
we
have
an
individual
who
is
ordered
to
pay
support,
i
think
it
is...
a
reasonable
person
would
seek
to
modify
that
order
if
he
could
no
longer
make
the
support
payments.
his
failure
to
seek
modification
causes
the
missed
payments
to
accrue
and
build
in
arrearage,
which
some
day
he
is
going
to
have
to
pay,
as
he
was
ordered
to
pay
even
in
this
case,
because
even
though
he
was
found
not
guilty
on
some
of
the
months
of
contempt,
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
he
was
still
found
able
to
pay
in
installments
and
was
ordered
to
make
payments
even
for
those
months
for
which
he
could
not
have
been
held
in
contempt
because
of
the
coercive
nature
of
it
and
the
fact
that
the
missed
support
payments
accrue.
now,
a
reasonable
person
would
seek
to
modify
that
order
if
he
truly
had
no
ability
to
pay.
and
his
failure
to
seek
modification
is
a
tacit
admission
that
the
order
remains
valid
and
reliable.
and
that
is
especially
true
in
california,
having
enacted
a
code
section,
civil
code
4700.1,
that
makes
it
extremely
easy
for
an
individual
to
modify
a
support
order.
it
is
almost
as
though
it
is
a
small
claims
action,
and
attorneys
are
not
required,
and
its
express
purpose
is
to
make
it
easy
to
modify
a
support
order.
so
given
those
factors,
it
seems
to
me
a
reasonable
person
would
modify
and
an
unmodified
order
supports
the
presumed
fact
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
original
order
is
still
valid.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
it
is
a
burden
of
producing...
or
burden
of
proof
in
most
states.
i
would
submit
that
with
respect
to
whether
in
this
case
it
was
a
burden
of
production
or
a
burden
of
proof,
we
should
look
to
the
cases
in
california
which
have
said
that
it
was
a
burden
of
production.
we
should
look
to
the
treatises
in
california
which
say
it
is
a
burden
of
production,
1209.5.
we
should
look
to
penal
code
section
270,
the
criminal
nonsupport
section,
and
the
california
supreme
court,
people
versus
sorenson,
interpreting
a
presumption
in
that
criminal
section
very
comparable
to
the
presumption
here
as
being
one
involving
the
burden
of
producing
evidence.
now,
i
submit
that
we
should
examine
those
even
though
they
were
ignored
by
the
court
of
appeal
below,
and
the
reason
we
should
examine
those
is
because
even
though
the
court
below
ignored
them,
the
trial
judge
didn't.
and
just
as
in
ulster
versus
allen,
in
footnote
16,
this
court
said
we
should
look
to
the
jury
instructions
and
how
it
was
treated
at
the
trial
level.
the
presumption
in
this
case
was
treated
at
the
trial
level
by
the
trial
judge
as
one
affecting
the
burden
of
proof.
all
of
the
other
cases,
the
treatises
were
available
to
him.
he
expressed
an
awareness
of
the
long-standing
law.
and
he
expressly
stated
on
the
record
that
he
was
treating
it
as
affecting
the
burden
of
going
forwards,
which
is
another
way
of
saying
the
burden
of
producing
evidence.
and
it
was
based
on
the
way
it
was
treated
by
the
trial
court
and
the
laws
in
california
which
treats
a
presumption
affecting
the
burden
of
producing
evidence
almost
the
same
way
as
this
court
analyzed
a
permissive
inference
in
allen...
in
ulster
county
versus
allen.
the
evidence
code
section
604,
which
sets
forth
how
that
presumption
affecting
the
burden
of
producing
evidence
is
to
be
used
is
almost
identical
to
the
definition
of
a
permissive
inference
in
ulster
county
versus
allen,
and
therefore
even
if
we
were
to
assume
that
it
was
a
criminal
case,
i
submit
that
it
was
treated
by
the
trial
court
as
a
burden,
as
a
presumption
affecting
the
burden
of
producing
evidence,
and
as
such
meets
the
due
process
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
would
submit
that
the
order
of
the
court
below
finding
the
statute
unconstitutional
was
in
error
and--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
he
did,
justice
stevens,
make
a
finding
that
there
was
ability
to
pay.
after
first
relying
on
the
presumption
which
the
trial
judge
treated
as
one
affecting
the
burden
of
producing
evidence,
and
once
the
respondent
then
produced
evidence
under
california
law

showed
the
nonexistence
of
the
presumed
fact,
then
the
court
was
required
to
treat
the
evidence
without
reference
to
the
presumption,
and
based
upon
his
analysis
then
of
the
evidence,
including
the
testimony
of
the
respondent,
he
found
him
guilty
of
the
five
counts
of
contempt
and
dismissed
four
of
the
counts.

made

the
ability
to
pay

the
ultimate
result,
no.
it
assisted
in
travelling
the
path
to
reach
that,
but
ultimately
it
was
based
upon
the
testimony
of
the
defendant.
we
would
submit
the
court

the
order
finding

mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
if
there
was
such
a
defendant
in
jail
and
he
did
have
the
money,
we
would
be
so
willing
and
happy
to
take
that
money
for
the
children
it
is
undoubtedly--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--i
think
the
judge
would--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--where
it
is
the
coercive
element
that
is
trying
to
be
utilized,
and
the
entire
thrust
of
these
proceedings
is
to
coerce
payment,
to
get
the
payment
for
that
child,
and
it
is
only
as
a
last
resort
that
the
jail--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--no,
that
is
absolutely
incorrect,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--he
is
wrong,
and
i
think
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
this
case
indicated
that
he
is
wrong.
the
jail
sentence
was
suspended
on
condition
that
he
make
the
payments
and
it
is
only
if
he
failed
to
make
the
payments
that
the
coercive
element
would
then
come
into
play.
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
absolutely.
it
was
suspended
on
the
condition
that
he
make
the--
mr.
michael
r.
capizzi
--but
the
sentence
was
suspended
because
mr.
feiock
didn't
have
the
wherewithal
to
pay
the
$1,650
at
the
time
he
was
given
a
payment
schedule
and
told
to
reduce
the
arrearage
at
the
rate
of
$50
per
month.
and
so
it
was
necessary
to
continue
the
course
of
nature
of
that
25-day
jail
sentence.
if
he
pays,
he
will
never
do
the
time.
and
there
is
certainly
a
preference
that
he
pay
rather
than
that
he
do
the
time.
counsel
is
also
incorrect
in
categorizing
this
as
criminal.
city
of
culver
city
versus
superior
court,
a
california
supreme
court
case,
at
page
549,
says,
"but
in
california
the
proceedings
leading
to
punishment
for
failure
to
obey
a
decree,
criminal
contempt,
and
to
imprisonment
until
the
omitted
act
is
performed,
civil
contempt,
are
exactly
the
same.
"
although
the
sections
which
provide
the
procedure
for
both
kinds
of
contempt
are
provided
for
in
1209
of
the
code
of
civil
procedure,
contempt
proceedings
are
said
to
be
criminal
in
nature,
and
those
procedural
right
and
safeguards
which
are
appropriate
to
criminal
contempt
proceedings
are
also
afforded
in
california
in
civil
contempt
proceedings.
so
we
continue
to
draw
a
distinction
based
upon
the
substantive
aspect,
but
we
extend
the
procedural
safeguards
the
same
to
both.
and
as
a
result,
both
civil
contempt
and
criminal
contempt
are
deemed
to
be
criminal
in
nature.
and
the
court
below
did
not
categorize
this
as
criminal--
