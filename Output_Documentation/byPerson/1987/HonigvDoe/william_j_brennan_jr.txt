this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
case
requires
interpretation
of
the
so-called
'stay-put"
provision
of
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act
which
directs
that
a
disabled
child
"shall
remain
in
his
or
her
then
current
educational
placement"
pending
completion
of
any
review
proceedings,
unless
the
parents
and
state
or
local
educational
agencies
otherwise
agree,
and
despite
the
clarity
of
that
direction,
officials
of
the
san
francisco
unified
school
district
tried
to
remove
two
emotionally
disturb
children
from
their
placements
by
expelling
them
from
school
indefinitely
for
violent
and
disruptive
conduct
related
to
their
disabilities.
when
the
school
officials
advice
the
parents
of
their
intention
to
expel
the
children,
the
suit
was
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
then
injunction
issued
against
the
expulsion
on
the
ground
of
the
proposed
expulsion
and
suspension
are
conduct
attributable
to
the
children's
disabilities
violated
the
stay-put
provision.
the
school
district
was
also
permanently
enjoined
from
taking
any
disciplinary
action
other
than
the
brief
2
or
5-day
suspension
against
any
disabled
child
for
disability-related
misconduct
or
from
effecting
any
other
change
in
the
educational
placement
of
any
such
child
without
parental
consent
pending
completion
of
any
proceedings
under
the
act.
finally,
the
state
was
ordered
to
provide
services
directly
to
disabled
children,
when,
in
any
individual
case,
the
state
determined
that
the
local
educational
authority
was
unable
or
unwilling
to
do
so.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
with
only
slight
modifications.
the
court
held
that
the
stay-put
provision
of
the
federal
act
admitted
of
no
dangerousness
exception
and
therefore
that
provision
rendered
invalid
those
provisions
of
the
california
educational
code
permitting
the
indefinite
suspension
or
expulsion
of
disabled
children
or
misconduct
arising
out
of
their
disabilities.
petitioner,
california
superintendent
of
public
instruction,
sought
certiorari
and
we
granted
his
petition,
and
we
now
affirm.
at
the
outset,
we
will
address
the
suggestion
of
the
united
states
if
the
case
is
moot
reason
stated
in
our
opinion
we
reject
that
suggestion.
turning
to
the
merits
we
hold
first
that
the
unequivocal
wording
of
section
1415(e)(3)
that
during
dependency
of
any
proceedings
initiated
under
the
act
unless
the
state
of
local
educational
agency
and
the
parents
or
guardians
of
the
disabled
child
otherwise
agree
while
the
child
shall
remain
into
then
current
educational
placement
and
"compels
and
affirmance"
and
we
decline
petitioner's
invitation
to
rewrite
the
statute.
this
is
not
to
say
that
school
officials
may
not
seek
judicial
relief
in
appropriate
cases,
but
in
any
such
action
1415(e)(3)
effectively
creates
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
child's
current
educational
placement
which
school
officials
can
overcome
only
by
showing
that
maintaining
the
child
in
his
or
her
current
placement,
a
substantially
likely
to
result
in
injury
either
to
himself
or
herself,
or
to
others.
in
the
present
case,
we
hold
that
the
district
court
properly
balanced
the
children's
interest
in
receiving
a
free
appropriate
public
education
against
the
interests
of
the
school
officials
in
maintaining
a
safe
learning
environment
for
all
their
students.
because
we
are
equally
divided
on
the
question
whether
a
court
may
order
a
state
to
provide
services
directly
to
a
disabled
child
where
the
local
agency
has
failed
to
do
so,
we
affirm,
in
that
aspect,
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
by
an
equally
divided
court.
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
justice
scalia
joined
by
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
