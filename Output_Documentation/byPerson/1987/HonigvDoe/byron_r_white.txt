justice
white
is
it
your
position
then
that
the
"stay-put"
provision
just
is
not
violated
when
the
school
suspends
a
violent
student?
justice
white
whether
it
is
for
30
days
or
100
days
or
anything
else?
justice
white
but
i
take
it,
then,
that
a
district
court
in
a
case
like
this
should
say,
"well,
the"
stay-put
"provision
is
not
violated
by
a
suspension
of
a
violent
student,
but
i
have
got
to
make
sure
that
the
school
is
promptly
taking
care
of
this?
"
justice
white
why
is
this
case
not
moot?
justice
white
there
were
claims
for
damages,
but
they
were
rejected,
i
take
it?
justice
white
but
there
was
a
settlement
on
damages,
but
was
that
contingent
on
liability
or
what?
justice
white
what
do
you
mean,
if
the
local...
if
the
school
authorities
win
this
case
like
you
think
they
should,
are
they
just
going
to
pay
the
damages?
justice
white
is
that
because
suspension
is
not
a
change
in
placement?
is
that
it?
justice
white
why
would
it...
a
100-day
suspension
be
a
change?
justice
white
we
are
construing
a
statute
here.
you
are
saying
that
a
suspension
under
the
statute
is
not
a
change
in
placement
and
does
not
violate
the
"stay-put'
rule".
justice
white
how
do
you
pick
out
five
days
or
30
or
40
or
50?
justice
white
and
that
is
just
because
of
the...
you
are
just
saying--
justice
white
--despite
the
language
of
the
statute,
suspensions
may
be
put
into
effect
and
the
child
excluded
from
school--
justice
white
--for
a
length
of
time
without
violating
the
"stay-put"
position?
justice
white
is
that
not
right?
that
is
your--
