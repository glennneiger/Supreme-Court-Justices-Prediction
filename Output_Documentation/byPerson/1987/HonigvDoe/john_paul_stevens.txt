justice
stevens
before
you
get
into
that,
just
to
refresh
my
recollection,
before
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
what
was
the
posture
of
the
matter?
the
first
plaintiff
had
been
suspended
permanently
or
for
three
or
four
days,
or
what?
your
honor,
he
had
initially
been
suspended
for
five
days,
but
that
suspension
was
extended
by
the
school
district
with
a
view
to
referring
him
for
possible
exclusion
or
expulsion
from
the
school
district.
was
the
lawsuit
filed
not
until
after
that
had
been
done,
is
that
correct?
justice
stevens
was
it
while
the
five...
before
the
five-day
suspension
had
expired?
justice
stevens
so
by
the
time
the
lawsuit
had
been
filed,
he
had
been
suspended
indefinitely?
justice
stevens
mr.
nager,
do
you
have
a
position
on
what
the
appropriate
relief
in
this
case
would
have
been?
justice
stevens
is
it
something
that
the
district
court
should
have
ordered?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
there
was
a
violation
of
the
"stay-put"
provision?
justice
stevens
well,
then
there
should
have
been
no
relief,
i
guess?
justice
stevens
i
am
focusing
on
what
the
district
judge
should
do
when
they
come
into
a
court
in
this
kind
of
emergency.
your
view
is
that
they
should
have
done
nothing?
justice
stevens
well,
but
her
language...
sentences,
considering,
after
going
on
both
sides
of
all
of
these
factors,
the
court
finds
that
the
balance
of
these
hardships
in
the
public
interest
way
in
favor
of
allowing
plaintiff
in
there.
is
that
not
the
way
you
end
up
a
balancing--
justice
stevens
--of
dangerousness
because
apparently
it
was
not
argued.
