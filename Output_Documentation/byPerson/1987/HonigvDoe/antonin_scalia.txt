justice
scalia
mr.
rubin,
could
you
elaborate
on
your
statement
that
the
20
year
old
conceivably
could
come
back
into
the
san...
i
mean,
anybody
in
the
country
could
conceivably
could
go
to
the
san
francisco
school
district.
justice
scalia
between
these
parties?
justice
scalia
mr.
rubin,
with
reference
to
that
statement,
is
a
"suspension"
a
"change
in
educational
placement"?
i
mean,
if
i
have
a
child
in
the
8th
grade
who
is
suspended
for
a
week
for
some
infraction,
is
he
no
longer
in
the
8th
grade?
justice
scalia
what
do
you
think?
ten
days?
twenty
days?
justice
scalia
that
would
not
ordinarily
be
enough,
would
it,
to
meet
our
standards?
justice
scalia
so,
for
this
case
to
recur,
we
have
to
assume
that
jack
smith
is
going
to
move
back
to
san
francisco;
that
he
is
going
to
be
placed
by
the
san
francisco
school
district
in
a
program
that
cannot
handle
violent
children;
and
that
this
same
episode
will
repeat
itself.
not
very
likely.
justice
scalia
either
one.
justice
scalia
fine.
let
us
assume
that
he
asks
for
it
and
he
asks
for
it
in
san
francisco.
he
would
have
to
move
back
to
san
francisco
first,
right?
there
are
a
lot
of
people
living
within
20
miles
of
san
francisco
whom
we
do
not
expect
to
move
there
in
the
immediate
future,
right.
but
he
comes
back
in.
we
also
have
to
assume
that
the
state
is
going
to
be
foolish
enough...
or
the
city...
is
going
to
be
foolish
enough
at
this
point
to
place
this
individual
that
had
this
record
of
violence
that
they
are
worried
about,
in
a
program
that
cannot
cope
with
that
kind
of
a
student,
and
then
go
through
the
same
routine
that
they
go
through
here...
suspend
them
and
what-not.
is
that
really
capable
of
repetition
in
the
sense
that
we
have
said
in
our
caselaw?
justice
scalia
put
them
in
a
program
that
they
know
cannot
handle
them?
petitioner
is
not
saying
that.
justice
scalia
the
chief
justice
is
trying
to
help
you,
ms.
brogna,
and
i
think--
0
[mirth.]
justice
scalia
ms.
brogna,
the
state
of
california
has
conceded,
however,
has
it
not,
that
the
procedures
employed
here
were
in
some
respects
not
correct.
justice
scalia
so
again,
even
if
the
state
is
the
only
party,
do
you
think
there
is
a
real
likelihood
that
the
same
thing
would
occur
in
another
school
district
in
california?
justice
scalia
ms.
brogna,
may
i
ask
you
about
the
government's
proposal
which
you
accepted
here,
do
you
think
it
is
correct
that
the
district
court
has
discretion
despite
the
language
of
the
statute
to
use
some
other
placement
if
that
is
more
appropriate?
that
seems
like
a
very
nice
resolution
in
this
case,
but
if
you
allow
that
to
happen,
you
are
saying
that,
"even
though
the
school
district
violated
the
law,
the
remedy
for
that
violation
cannot
be
putting
him
back
in
the
same
classroom,
right?
"
"the
district
court
may
give
a
different
remedy?
"
justice
scalia
right,
but
the
next
suit,
in
the
next
suit,
it
will
have
been
established
that
the
school
district
and
its
officials
violated
the
law
by
taking
him
out
of
that
particular
placement.
and
those
individuals
will
then
be
subject
to
civil
liabilities,
will
they
not,
if
they
take
him
out
of
that
placement?
and
merely
using
the
injunctive
powers
of
the
court
does
not
solve
that
problem,
so
you
are
ultimately
going
to
end
up
with
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
prohibits
the
school
district
from
removing
him
from
that
placement,
even
if
he
is
dangerous.
justice
scalia
so,
in
the
future,
although
in
this
one
case,
the
injunctive
powers
of
the
court
would
solve
the
problem,
it
will
not
solve
the
problem
in
the
future,
because
we
are
going
to
be
imposing
civil
liability
on
people
who
take
the
"dangerous
student"
out,
if
you
will
accept
that
characterization,
out
of
this
particular
placement.
justice
scalia
i
agree
with
you,
but
let
us
just
be
clear
what
we
are
saying,
if
we
say
that
only
the
injunction...
only
the
injunction
remedy
exists.
justice
scalia
well,
it
is
not
that
they
cannot
get
them
out
of
the
program.
they
can
get
them
out
of
the
program
but
only
with
the
consent
of
the
parent--
justice
scalia
--and
one
would
assume
that
the
parent
would
not
want
to
leave
them
in
a
program
where
he
is
likely
to
choke
somebody.
justice
scalia
with
an
emotionally
disturbed
child,
i
mean,
one
expects
that
that
is
occasionally
the
problem.
was
it
an
incident
that
reached
the
point
of
real
danger
to
another
that
the
previous
incidents
have?
