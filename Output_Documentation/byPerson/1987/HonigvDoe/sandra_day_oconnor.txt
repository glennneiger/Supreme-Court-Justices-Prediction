justice
o'connor
mr.
rubin,
both
of
the
students
involved
in
this
case
have
now
left
the
public
schools
system,
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
am
just
asking
the
present
status
of
these
students.
justice
o'connor
may
i
ask,
as
long
as
you
are
interrupted,
whether
you
raised
the
first
question
in
your
cert
petition,
the
so-called
"dangerousness
exception"
to
the
statute
in
the
courts
below?
justice
o'connor
well,
can
you
refer
me
to
anything
specific
so
that
i
might
satisfy
myself
that
you
indeed
raised
it
below?
justice
o'connor
mr.
rubin,
i
thought
the
ninth
circuit
referred
to
30
days,
not
20
days?
justice
o'connor
is
there
not
some
federal
guideline
that
suggests
10
days
is
the
limit?
justice
o'connor
so
that
would
be
the
administrative
agency
interpretation
placed
on
it
by
the
federal
agency?
justice
o'connor
well,
there
is
a
problem
with
the
"stay-put
provision",
which
does
appear
to
indicate
that
congress
thought
that
a
child
should
stay
put,
pending
following
the
procedural
provisions
in
the
statute.
now,
if
we
were
to
say
somehow
there
was
a
"dangerousness"
exception,
a
school
district
could
certainly
evade
the
procedural
protections
envisioned
by
the
statute
by
labelling
a
child
"dangerous".
justice
o'connor
call
it
what
you
will,
you
want
us
to
read
something
into
the
statute
that
is
not
expressly
there,
and
that
would
appear
at
least
on
the
face
of
it
to
read
in
an
exception
that
would
be
at
tension
with
the
statute.
the
solicitor-general
makes
quite
a
different
proposal
to
us
than
yours.
do
you
want
to
comment
on
the
solicitor-general's
approach?
justice
o'connor
is
respondent
smith
living
in
the
san
francisco
school
district
now?
justice
o'connor
well,
ms.
brogna,
we
are
dealing
with
situations
that
are
not
always
predictable
and
human
beings
do
not
always
operate
with
perfection,
as
we
know.
but
if
a
case
such
as
this
is
properly
before
a
district
court,
do
you
not
agree
that
the
district
court,
if
it
is
asked
for
injunctive
relief,
should
make
the
kind
of
balancing
traditionally
made
by
courts
in
granting
an
injunction,
as
suggested
by
the
solicitor-general?
is
that
not
proper?
justice
o'connor
did
the
district
court
make
that
kind
of
a
balancing
inquiry
here,
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
ms.
brogna,
if
your
position
is
correct
on
the
statute
and
that
there
is
no
authority
for
the
school
district
to
make
any
exception
for
a
dangerous
child,
other
than
the
five-day
suspension
in
california,
will
not
the
inevitable
effect
be
that
a
school
would
want
to
place
such
a
child
in
the
most
restrictive
environment
at
the
outset,
rather
than
run
the
risk
that
it
otherwise
would,
that
it
couldn't
change
the
placement
if
the
child
acts
out?
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
if
you
are
going
to
be
held
liable...
if
you
make
a
misjudgment
in
the
placement,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
is
human
nature
that
would
cause
the
school
to
be
very
conservative
in
making
the
placements
in
the
first
instance,
so
i
think
the
result
you
may
get
could
be
one
you
would
not
want.
