h.
rehnquist
mr.
rubin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
rubin,
were
these
other
children...
were
they
handicapped
also,
or
were
they
non-handicapped?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rubin.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
nager.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nager.
we
will
now
hear
from
you,
ms.
brogna.
ms.
brogna,
did
your
clients
file
a
cross-petition
for
certiorari
or
not
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
brogna,
when
you
say
"the
bottom-line
intent
of
the
petitioner.
"
the
petitioner
here
is
the
state
superintendent,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
san
francisco
unified
schools
have
never
petitioned
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what
then
we
are
talking
about
here
is
really
jack
smith's
possible
relationship,
not
to
the
san
francisco
unified
school
district,
but
to
the
state
of
california
and
to
the
superintendent
of
education,
are
we
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
what
i
am
suggesting
for
the
purposes
of
mootness,
are
the
state
of
california
is
the
one
involved
here.
it
is
not
really
just
the
san
francisco
unified
school
district.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
brogna,
when
you
say,
"it
specifically
did
not",
referring
to
congress,
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
evidence
that
this
proposal
was
made
to
congress
and
congress
said,
'no,
we
do
not
want
that
in
it?
"or
that
it
just
omitted
it?
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
ms.
brogna,
you
say
"cavalierly
characterized
as
"dangerous".
"
are
we
to
take
it
from
that
that
you
do
not
agree
that
this
particular
incident
could
be
described
as
being
"dangerous"?
chief
justice
rehnquist
"no",
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
despite
the
fact
that
they
are?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--who
is
that
comment
by?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brogna.
mr.
rubin,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rubin.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-728,
honig
against
doe
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
