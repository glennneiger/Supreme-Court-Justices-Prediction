mr.
asher
rubin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
interpretation
of
two
provisions
of
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children
act,
the
eha.
the
first
issue
concerns
the
so-called
"stay-put
provision".
that
section
states,
"during
the
pendency
of
any
proceedings
conducted
pursuant
to
this
section,
unless
the
state
or
local
educational
agency
and
the
parents
or
guardian
otherwise
agree,
the
child
shall
remain
in
the
then-current
educational
placement
of
such
child.
"
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
that,
"this
operates
as
an
automatic
injunction
in
that
it
lists
no
exceptions.
"
the
second
issue
involves
a
provision
which,
if
i
might
paraphrase
it,
states
that,
"where
a
local
educational
agency
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
provide
services
to
handicapped
children,
the
state
itself
must
step
in
and
provide
those
services
directly.
"
the
facts
which
gave
rise
to
this
case
may
be
stated
briefly.
john
doe
was
released
from
a
state
mental
hospital
in
the
spring
of
1980
and
was
enrolled
in
the
san
francisco
school
district
and
an
individualized
education
program
was
designed
for
him,
an
iep>
["],
and
he
was
placed
in
a
special
school.
in
october
1980,
he
got
involved
in
an
altercation
with
a
child
and
attempted
to
choke
a
by-stander.
no
disciplinary
action
was
taken
at
that
time,
although
the
principal
and
his
aides
tried
to
work
with
him.
shortly
afterward,
on
november
6,
1980
a
far
more
serious
incident
occurred.
he
got
involved
this
time
in
an
argument
with
a
child
over
a
basketball
and
he
jumped
on
this
child
and
choked
him
and
strangled
him
to
the
point
where
this
other
child
did
suffer
abrasions
to
his
neck
and
pain--
mr.
asher
rubin
--they
were
handicapped
children,
your
honor.
this
was
a
school
for
trainable
mentally
retarded
children.
he
was
in
a
class
of
about
12
children.
mr.
asher
rubin
i
have
a
feeling
i
am
going
to
hear
about
mootness
here.
your
honor--
mr.
asher
rubin
--your
honor,
the
first
student,
john
doe,
is
over
the
age
of
21.
he
is
no
longer
in
the
school
district.
he
is
in
a
state
mental
hospital.
the
second
student
left
the
school
system,
actually
in
another
town,
in
1985.
he
is
20
years
old
and
conceivably
could
re-enter
the
san
francisco
school
district.
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
we
believe
we
did.
we
believe
that
it
was
not
stressed
at
an
early
point.
it
was
present
in
the
case
all
the
way
along.
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
in
terms...
i
personally
did
not
raise
it.
it
was
raised
by
the
plaintiffs
who
raised
it
in
all
of
their
pleadings.
it
was
adverted
to
by
the
district
court
and,
of
course,
discussed
in
great
detail
by
the
ninth
circuit.
and
it
was
this
perception
that
the
children
were
dangerous
were
reflected
in
many
of
the
evidentiary
documents
which
were
submitted
as
exhibits
to
the
initial
complaint.
so,
in
terms
of
our
raising
it,
we
really
focused
in
on
it
when
the
ninth
circuit
made
clear
that
this
was
an
issue
that
they
intended
to
treat
at
some
length.
mr.
asher
rubin
with
respect
to
possible
mootness,
your
honor,
we
think
that
this
is
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review,
although
within
the
murphy
v.
hunt
requirement
that
there
be
a
"reasonable
expectation",
in
that
it
will
recur
between
these
parties--
mr.
asher
rubin
--i
can
make
no
representation.
i
believe
that
would
be
up
to
respondents
who
represent
him
and
know
more
of
his
circumstances.
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
i
believe
he
is
in
san
francisco
or
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area;
he
is
20
and
that
it
is
possible
that
he
could...
these
children
have
been
in
and
out
of
services
provided
by
the
san
francisco
school
district.
it
is
possible,
but
i
cannot
represent
to
the
court
that
he
will
in
fact
return.
as
i
said,
perhaps
respondents
might
be
able
to
shed
some
light
on
that.
with
respect
to
the
factual
situation
concerning...
let
me
return
then
to
the
factual
situation
concerning
john
smith.
after
this
incident
in
the
classroom,
he
was
pulled
off
the
other
child;
he
kicked
out
a
plate
glass
window
and
was
immediately
suspended
from
school.
before
any
administrative
actions
could
be
taken,
the
instant
action
was
filed
in
the
district
court.
with
respect
to
jack
smith
we
have
another
factual
history.
he
was
involved
in
certain
acts
of
misconduct--
mr.
asher
rubin
--your
honor,
at
the
time
of
the
incident,
he
was--
mr.
asher
rubin
--john
doe
was,
17
years
old,
he
was
6
feet
tall
and
he
weighed
195
pounds.
mr.
asher
rubin
the
other
one
was
13
years
old.
now,
with
respect
to
jack
smith,
the
intervenor,
he
had
a
series
of
acts
of
misconduct,
and
among
those
was...
were,
stealing
and
a
more
serious
incident
where
he
grabbed
another
child
up
by
the
neck,
pulled
him
into
a
bathroom,
asked
him
for
his
money,
took
his
wallet
and
took
all
the
money
that
the
child
had,
some
six
dollars.
so
we
have
children
here,
presented
by
the
facts
here,
who
may
reasonably
be
perceived
to
be
"dangerous
children".
and
the
question
is,
what
do
you
do
with
such
dangerous
children?
when
you
suspend
them,
what
do
you
do
with
them
pending
review
proceedings?
of
course,
to
resolve
this,
we
have
got
to
look
at
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
asher
rubin
it
was
filed
before
it
could
be
done,
before
a
hearing
could
be--
mr.
asher
rubin
--no,
it
was
after
that
five-day
suspension
had--
mr.
asher
rubin
--on
an
extended
suspension.
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
and
i
should
add,
your
honor,
the
state
petitioner
here
is
not
in
agreement
with
all
the
actions
taken
by
the
school
district.
we
think
they
made
some
mistakes.
and
we
want
to
quickly
establish
that
this
is
not
the
procedural
sequence
that
we
believe
should
be
followed
in
california.
mr.
asher
rubin
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
asher
rubin
no,
your
honor,
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
asher
rubin
i
do
not
know
why
it
was
not.
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
i
believe
initially
they
try
to
handle
these
things
administratively.
kicking
out
a
window
i
would
think
would
be
a
punishable
offense.
mr.
asher
rubin
well,
hopefully,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
a
manifestation
of
my
handicap.
if
it
were,
i
would
seriously
question
whether--
mr.
asher
rubin
--well,
no,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
not
in
the
record,
but
later
on
in
1982,
i
believe
it
was,
john
doe
was
involved
in
the
criminal
justice
system
and
did
go
on
to
the
state
hospital.
i
think
we
have
got
to
decide
how
to
handle
this
case
by
looking
at
the
intent
of
congress.
that,
of
course,
is
our
most
important
guide.
there
is
nothing
specific
in
the
legislative
history
which
touches
directly
on
what
you
do
with
dangerous
children.
but
we
do
have
some
clues.
we
know,
for
example,
that
congress
was
heavily
influenced
by
the
mills
case
and
the
parks
case,
two
district
court
decisions.
now,
what
did
mills
say?
in
mills
the
court
said
something
that
we
think
is
directly
on
point
here:
in
mills,
the
court
said,
"pending
the
hearing
and
in
receipt
of
notification
of
the
decision
there
shall
be
no
change
in
the
child's
educational
placement,
unless
the
principal
shall
warrant
that
the
continued
presence
of
the
child
in
his
current
program
would
endanger
the
physical
well-being
of
himself
or
others.
"
"in
such
exceptional
cases,
the
principal
shall
be
responsible
for
ensuring
that
the
child
receive
some
form
of
educational
assistance
and/or
diagnostic
examinations
during
the
interim
period.
"
"now
that
is
in
mills.
"
a
comparable
statement
was
made--
mr.
asher
rubin
--the
consensus
seems
to
be
that
10
days...
the
9th
circuit
said
20
days
here...
a
suspension
would
in
effect
become
a
change
in
placement.
mr.
asher
rubin
well,
a
short
suspension,
during
which
you
are
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
do
with
the
child,
certainly
would
not
be
a
change
in
placement,
whether
it
is
ten
days
or
twenty
days,
i
would
have
to
say
20
days,
i
think,
which
the
ninth
circuit
allowed
us--
mr.
asher
rubin
--well,
30
is
in
a
special
case,
your
honor
when
it
involves
a
transfer
from
one
school
from
another.
mr.
asher
rubin
there
is,
i
believe,
and--
mr.
asher
rubin
--yes.
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
significance
is
that
after
a
short
period
of
suspension,
whether
it
is
ten
days
or
whether
it
is
20
days,
you
have
got
to
give
that
child
some
educational
services,
and
if
you
consider
it
an
interim
placement,
the
point
is
that
you...
or
he...
we
realize
he
is
being
deprived
of
educational
services
so
long
as
he
is
out
of
school.
and
it
is
our
position
you
do
not
abandon
that
child;
you
do
not
warehouse
the
child;
you
do
not
rid
yourself
of
some
troublesome
problem.
you
give
that
child
services
during
this
period.
and
what
we
are
saying
is,
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
is
to
put
him
back
in
that
classroom
where
he
just
assaulted
another
child
and
where
he
is
likely
to
repeat
that
conduct.
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
first,
i
think
we
can
look
at
this
as
not
really...
an
exception
to
the
statute.
we
think
that
it
is
implicit
in
the
statute.
this
court
in
rowley,
for
example,
said
that,
"implicit
in
this
statute
was
the
notion
that,
when
a
handicapped
child
receives
benefits,
that
there
will
be
some
substantial
benefit
to
that
education.
"
and
the
court
used
the
word
"implicit"
in
the
statute.
we
think
"implicit"
in
this
statute
is
the
notion
that
congress
is
saying,
"we
do
not
intend
to
strip
away
from
school
districts
their
traditional
authority
and
responsibilities
to
guarantee
the
safety
in
the
school....
"
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
i
believe
the
solicitor-general's
approach,
which
i
hesitate
to
characterize
for
him,
is
an
alternative
which...
has
some
merit
to
it,
that
is,
you
can
give
the
district
court
the
ability
to
weigh
these
matters
as
ordinary
injunctive
matters
and
balance
equities
and
irreparable
injury,
et
cetera.
that
is
a
possible
approach.
but
permit
me,
if
you
will,
to
precede
to
my
second
issue,
which
is
the
question
of
whether
in
an
individual
case,
the
state
must
provide
direct
services
to
a
child?
the
ninth
circuit
says
that,
"where
the
local
educational
agency
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
provide
services
to
one
child,
to
any
individual
child,
the
state
must
step
in
and
provide
those
services.
"
and
we
believe
that
is
contrary
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
speaks
in
terms
of
"children
residing
in
the
area";
which
talks
about
"programs".
this
is
repeated
in
c.f.r.
section
300.360,
where
they
talk
about
"children
in
the
area
served".
we
think
that
congress
meant
this:
local
school
districts
are
on
the
front
line.
they
give
these
services,
and
where
you
have
children
who
can
be
served
only
in
a
regional
center
like
a
school
for
the
deaf
or
a
school
for
the
blind,
that
is
when
the
state
steps
in.
or
where
you
have
a
small
district
that
does
not
have
a
program
in
its
district
whatever
for
handicapped
children.
or
it
is
unwilling
to
set
out
a
program
for
its
district
as
a
whole,
then
the
state
steps
in.
otherwise
you
have
got
the
complaint
procedures
in
1415,
where
the
child
or
its
representative,
files
the
complaint
and
goes
through
those
procedures
which
are
designed
to
protect
him
and
gets
the
services
to
which
he
is
entitled.
and
upon
the
completion
of
those
procedures,
1
if
it
ever
goes
to
a
district
court,
the
district
court
has
a
fully
developed
record
and
can
make
an
intelligent
choice.
so,
we
think
that
in
both
these...
on
both
these
issues,
we
are
implementing
the
intent
of
congress.
on
the
first
issue
it
is
implicit
that
congress
could
not
have
meant
to
take
form
school
authorities
the
responsibility
to
guarantee
a
safe
classroom
and
a
safe
environment.
and
on
the
second
issue,
that
the
scheme
is
such
that
the
state
provides
direct
services
only
when
a
local
district
acts
in
the
manner
which
we
have
indicated.
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
respondent
in
answering
a
question
from
justice
marshall,
indicated
that
it
was
significant
that
when
an
aid
was
placed
in
a
classroom
with
john
doe,
there
were
no
further
incidents
during
the
year.
that
is
not
correct.
at
docket
no.
84,
there
is
a
document
which
states
"there
has
been
one
violent
incident
involving
other
students
in
the
tmr
school
since
the
instructional
aide
began.
"
so
there
was
an
incident
even
after
the
aide
was
put
in
there.
with
respect
to
justice
o'connor--
mr.
asher
rubin
--your
honor,
all
we
have
in
the
record
is
that
it
was
a
"violent
incident".
however,
we
do
have
this:
no.
137,
"he
was
enrolled
in
a
more
restrictive
placement
called.
"
challenged
learning.
"he
barricaded
himself
in
a
room;
he
came
out;
he
knocked
out
three
windows;
he
attacked
a
teacher.
"
this
is
not
just
disruptive
conduct
which
we
ordinarily
will
expect
from
handicapped
children.
this
is
violent,
dangerous
conduct.
that
is
all
in
the
record.
justice
o'connor
asked
about
what...
whether
the
district
court
did
balance
the
equities
and
did
undertake
to
do
that.
we
think
that
the
district
court
did
not
do
so.
she
made
certain
conclusionary
statements
having
to
do
with
irreparable
injury,
stating
that
it
was...
irreparable
injury
had
been
shown
by
the
complaint
and
the
exhibits.
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
the
kind
of
balancing
that
must
be
undertaken
in
a
finding
for
an
injunction.
mr.
asher
rubin
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
was
not
based
on
the
presentation
of
the
evidence
before
the
court
or
on
trial.
mr.
asher
rubin
well,
your
honor,
i
would
simply
say
that
that
is
a
conclusionary
finding
by
the
court
not
based
on
evidence.
thank
you,
your
honor.
