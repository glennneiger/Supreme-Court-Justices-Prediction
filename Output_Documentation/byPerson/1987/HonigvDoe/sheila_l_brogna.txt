ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
we
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
begin
right
to
the
beginning
by
saying
in
fact
john
doe
is
24
years
old.
he
is
in
a
state
hospital.
it
may
be
possible
under
california
law
that
has
just
come
out
within
the
last
ten
days
that
he
remain
eligible
for
education
by
the
state
department
in
california.
nevertheless,
jack
smith
is
20
years
old.
as
i
am
sure
you
know,
the
eha
extends
the
right
for
education
to
handicapped
children
through
the
age
of
22.
therefore,
he
still
is
eligible
for
education
from
the
unified
school
district,
and
certainly
under
the
auspices
of
the
state
department
of
education.
we
suggest,
therefore,
that
the
case
is
not
moot,
although
i
cannot
represent
whether
in
fact
either
of
these
students
will
ask
for
further
education
from
the
petitioners.
i
think,
as
young
people,
they
both
look
to
this
decision
to
find
out
what
will
happen
after
that.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
it
may
not
be,
given
the
inclination
of
the
court
to
say
that,
while
it
is
technically
possible
for
a
petitioner
to
come
within
the
circumstances
again,
if
in
fact
it
is
not
likely
that
they
will,
then
the
case
could
be
moot.
we
suggest,
however,
caution
in
that
area,
because
of
the
very
unique
nature
of
the
eha,
there
is,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
a
very
involved
administrative
process
which
involves
a
series
of
informal
meetings
and
administrative
review
at
the
state
level.
levels
of
either
and/or
both,
state
and
federal
review.
it
is
not,
i
think,
a
coincidence
to
see
that
the
only
two
cases
that
have
come
to
this
court
on
substantive
issues
of
education
under
the
eha
involve
children
who
started
the
dispute
when
they
were
in
kindergarten.
the
cases
of
tatro
and
rowley
were
both
small
children.
in
cases
at
least
like
this,
where
we
are
dealing
with
the
interplay
and
discipline
in
education,
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
expect
that
the
children
will
be
somewhat
older
than
that
when
the
process
starts
against
them.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
perhaps
that
would--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--i
do
not
believe
it
would
because
the
gravamen
of
the
injury
here,
your
honor,
was
in
fact
the
absence
of
a
state
policy
and
a
practice
of
the
state
to
sanction
actions
like
the
unified
school
districts
in
continuing
to
treat
handicapped
children
under
the
regular
discipline
code.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
well,
with
due
respect,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
is
not
true.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
jack
smith
is
within
the
age
when
he
can
continue
to
be
educated.
he
has
not--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--he
has
not
asked
to
go
back
to
the
unified
school
district.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
he
remains
eligible
under
the
federal
act.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
well,
they
would
have
been
at
the
time
it
started
because
san
francisco
or
the
state
of
california
did
not
allow
any
handicapped
child
who
was
disabled--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
yes.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
understand,
they
are
both--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--i
have
spoken
to
both
of
my
clients
within
the
last
two
weeks.
they
both
are
aware
that
their
cases
are
coming
before
this
court
for
consideration.
as
the
petitioner
represented,
john
doe
is
in
a
state
hospital.
he
is
still
under
the
auspices
of
the
state.
he
is
entitled
to
education.
jack
smith
is
within
the
state
of
california.
he
lives
in
the
bay
area;
he
has
not
graduated
from
high
school.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
jack
smith
has
not
been
found
insane.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
he
does
not
need...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
does
not
need
a
guardian
or
a
conservator,
if
that
is
what
you
are
suggesting.
he
has
not
been
conserved.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
he
is
not
living
in
the
school
district,
although
his
guardians
still
are.
he
lives
in
a
small
town
about
20
miles
outside
of
san
francisco.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
we
have
to
see.
well,
i
do
not
know
which
part
of
it
is
not
very
likely.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
i
think
it
is
likely
that
he
could
ask
for
education
because
he
in
fact
has
not
graduated,
and
it
is
his
right;
he
is
a
handicapped
student
and
needs
some
training.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
believe
that
it
is
not.
but
i
have
the
petitioner
here
before
this
court
saying
that,
if
they
are
given
this
judicially-created
exception
that
they
seek
here,
that
that
is
exactly
what
they
would
like
to
do
for
handicapped
students
like
jack,
so
i--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--well,
the
more
difficult
problem,
your
honor,
is
that
they
want
to
put
them
in
a
program
that
they
unilaterally
have
selected,
and
that
is
the
concern
more
than
any
other,
we
feel,
that
proposition
violates
congressional
intent.
congress
particularly
enacted
the
eha
to
include
parental
involvement
in
the
planning
for
handicapped
children.
the
bottom
line
problem
with
the
well-meaning
intentions
of
the
petitioner
are
that
they
want
to
be
allowed
to
select
the
program
for
handicapped
children
themselves
without
the
involvement
of
the
parents;
without
the
involvement
of
the
other
professionals.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
they
did
not,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
that
is
correct.
however,
the
eha,
we
believe,
makes
very
clear
and
in
particular
the
regulation
interpreting
the
statute
at
34
c.f.r.
300.600
does
very
clearly
state
that
the
state
department
of
education
is
the
ultimately
responsible
agency
for
the
education
of
handicapped
children.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
well,
that
is
correct,
and
i
certainly
point--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--we
would
point
out
that
there
are
final
orders
that
would
continue
to
be
in
effect
against
the
school
district;
the
injunctions
do
stand
and
have
not
been
appealed.
however,
in
fairness,
given
the
amount
of
concern
that
this
case
has
generated,
i
think
you
can
see
that
many,
many
school
districts
that
were
not...
would
not
be,
under
the
orders
of
the
lower
court
would
like
to
try
to
return
to
the
pre-1975
days
of
unilaterally
deciding
where
handicapped
children
should
be
placed.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
apparently
they
have.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
i
submit
i
cannot
predict
what
they
would
do.
i
certainly
would
hope
not.
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
district
court
injunction
is
a
well-reasoned
injunction
where
she
did
balance
the
equities
and
determined
that
the
balance
of
hardships
tips
in
favor
of
keeping
handicapped
children
in
the
current
placement
while
the
dispute
is
resolved.
however,
the
vehement
opposition
that
the
district
court's
injunction
has
engendered
leaves
me
unable
to
say
that
with
surety.
the
fact
that
petitioner
now
says
they
think
that
what
the
school
district
had
done
was
wrong,
is
very
heartening
for
us.
however,
i
do
want
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
aside
from
all
the
conversations
about
what
sorts
of
placement
the
child
should
be
moved
in,
the
facts
of
this
case
were
very
different.
there
was
not
a
dispute
about
alternative
placement
going
on.
what
happened
in
the
san
francisco
unified
school
district
and
what
was
sanctioned
by
the
california
state
department
of
education,
was
that
these
children
were
turned
out
of
school;
they
were
provided
no
alternative
education,
no
tutors,
no
special
programs.
they
were
proposed
to
be
excluded,
out
of
any
educational
services.
and
were
it
not
for
the
orders
of
the
district
court
that
is
exactly
what
would
have
happened.
so
we
need
to
look
at
the
idea
that
congress
was
aware
of
a
history
of
discrimination
of
discrimination
and
exclusion
on
the
part
of
handicapped
children,
and
in
fact,
the
exception
that
the
school
districts
and
the
state
department
of
education
is
asking
for
here
could
very
easily
result
in
that
exclusion
again--
the
fact
that
this
court
has
recognized
the
genesis
of
the
act
out
of
the
cases
of
mills
and
park,
as
this
court
observed,
cases
which
arose
from
parents'
concern
about
the
exclusion
of
their
children,
did
in
fact
have
an
exception
for
dangerous
children,
which
the
petitioner
referred
to
you.
we
feel
it
is
tremendously
significant
that,
when
congress
adopted
the
due
process
procedures
that
had
been
outlined
by
the
district
courts,
it
specifically
did
not
allow
that
exclusion
at
a
principal's
recommendation
to
be
codified
in
a
federal
law.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
there
is
not
a
discussion
about
that
in
particular,
although
there
are
many,
many
references
in
the
congressional
history,
your
honor,
to
the
fact
that
congress
reviewed
the
consent
decrees
in
mills
and
park
in
quite
detail,
and
provided
all
the
other
due
process
rights
that
had
been
written
up
and
drawn
together
as
the
scheme
in
the
mills
court
in
particular,
notice
and
opportunity
for
a
hearing,
the
right
to
be
accompanied
by
counsel;
the
right
to
have
a
transcript;
the
right
to
appeal
into
state
or
federal
court...
all
of
those
due
process
procedures
you
will
find
in
the
consent
decrees
in
mills
and
parks,
and
you
will
also
find
in
20
u.s.c.
1415.
the
only
thing
that
you
will
not
find
is
the
exclusion
at
the
principal's
determination
that
child
is
dangerous.
and
we
think
when
you
read
that
in
conjunction
with
the
federal
definition
which
appears
with
1401,
of
who
are
"handicapped
children",
the
inclusion
by
congress
of
emotionally
disturbed
children
leads,
we
believe
extricable
to
the
conclusion
that
the
kind
of
behavior
that
is
being
so
cavalierly
characterized
as
"dangerous"
here,
was
in
fact
behavior
that
was
not
unreasonably
expected
to
occur
by
congress.
congress
did
not
leave
school
administrators
helpless
in
the
face
of
emotionally
disturbed
children.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
no,
i
want
to--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--i
am
not
saying
that
it
was
not
or
could
not,
have
been
dangerous,
your
honor.
what
i
am
saying
is,
these
children
should
not
be
labelled
as
"dangerous".
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
well,
i
think,
as
perhaps
justice
scalia
was
suggesting,
if
appropriate
programs
and
appropriate
planning
has
been
made
for
these
children,
the
types
of
outbreaks
of
behavior
that
we
had
in
this
situation
should
not
properly
occur.
there
are
many,
many
other
methods
that
school
administrators
can
use
to
keep
the
behavior
of
children
under
control.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
it
is
absolutely
proper.
we
have
no
argument
with
that.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
yes,
she
did,
your
honor.
you
will
find
it
in
the
appendix
at
pages
64
through
66.
and
again,
at
i
believe
263,
in
both
the
issuance
of
the
preliminary
and
the
later
issuance
of
the
permanent,
injunction.
the
argument
that
we
see
with
the
solicitor-general's
position
is
that
(e)(3)
is
not
and
does
not
and
was
never
intended
and
has
not
been
interpreted,
to
act
as
an
automatic
injunction
on
the
district
courts.
it
is,
however,
intended
to
act
in
the
nature
of
an
injunction
on
unilateral
action
by
the
school
officials.
it
addresses
itself
to
the
parties
in
the
dispute.
there
is
no
question
under
1415(e)(2),
as
well
as
under
traditional
notions
of
judicial
power
that
a
district
court
could
balance
the
equities,
could
take
the
facts
before
it,
and
could,
by
judicial
order,
change
the
placement
pending
the
determination
of
an
ultimate
proceeding.
we
have
never
argued
with
that.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
certainly,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
you
will
notice
at--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--yes,
your
honor,
at
page...
i
believe
it
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
64,
when
the
district
court
is
talking
about
"balancing
the
interests",
she
remarked
about
the
fact
that
"plaintiff
himself
came
forward
#"--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--there
are
many
other
plans.
in
fact,
with
doe,
the
plaintiff--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--he
was
returned
to
his
classroom
and
in
this
case,
under
court
order,
with
an
aide
in
the
classroom
and
it
is
important
to
note
that
he
finished
the
school
year
without
incident.
there
are
other
ways
to
deal
with--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--he
cooperated
with
his
psychiatrist
and
with
the
school
officials.
there
was
the
addition
of
an
aide
in
the
classroom.
there
was
some
understanding,
i
hope,
in
the
classroom
teacher,
of
the
frustration.
but,
in
fact,
there
were
no
other
incidents.
this
may
have
been
solely
an
isolated
incident.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
i
would
say,
the
district
court,
having
viewed
the
particular
circumstances
of
a
case
before
it,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
prior
to
receiving
a
court
order
or
reaching
agreement
of
the
parents,
i
agree
with
you.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
your
honor,
with
respect,
i
believe
that
congress
has
already
made
that
determination.
congress
has
said,
"students
shall
remain
in
mandatory
and
very
clear
language.
"
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
yes,
we
think
that
the
statutory
scheme
is
set
up
so
that,
for
example,
when
a
child
acts
out
in
the
classroom,
the
school
districts
may
immediately
suspend
him.
california
currently...
you
are
allowed
an
immediate
suspension
of
up
to
five
days.
and
in
some
cases
longer.
during
those
five
days
we
suggested
that
the
school
administrators
should
be
looking
at
what
adaptations
or
program
changes
seem
to
be
necessitated
by
the
behavior,
if
any.
they
have
that
time
to
work
on
the
addition
of
related
services,
corrective
services,
behavior
modification
techniques...
any
other
teaching
methods
which
may
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
behavior.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
it
was
never
in
dispute.
the
short-term--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--well,
as
justice
o'connor
observed,
there
is
a
regulatory
ruling
that
suspensions
of
more
than
five...
ten,
days
probably--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--that
is
correct
in
the
interpretation
that
comes
from
the
comments
that
interpret
the
language
of
1415
that
talks
about
change
of
placement.
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
want
to
completely
bind
the
hands
of
school
officials
and
what
they
have
done
in
the
comments--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
we
pick
out
five
days
from
california
state
provision
for
suspension;
we
pick
out
ten
days
from
this
court's
ruling
in
goss
v.
lopez
and
the
interpretations
by
the
united
states
department
of
education.
we
think
anything
beyond
that
will
rise
to
a
level
of
a
change
in
placement.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--it
is
a
juxtaposition
of
the
state
and
federal--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--well,
your
honor,
you
will
see
that--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--you
will
see
the
comment
at--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--there
is
no
language
in
the
statute
that
talks
about
suspension,
you
are
correct.
there
is,
however,
a
comment
at
300.513
that
says,
"the
intent
of
1415(e)(3),
the.
"
stay-put
"provision,
is
that
while
a
placement
may
not
be
changed,
the
school
district
may
use
its
normal
procedures
for
dealing
with
a
disruptive
child.
"
we
submit
that,
under
state
law,
the
normal
procedure
is
the
short-term,
five-day
suspension.

it
is
by
the...
well,
it
was
issued
by
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
prior
to
the
change
in
the
administration.
but
it
is
an
officially-published
comment
to
the
regulations
issued
in
1978.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
well,
justice
o'connor,
we
would
certainly
hope
not,
because
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
the
education
for
the
handicapped
act
was
to
mainstream
these
children
and
have
them
educated
with
non-handicapped
to
the
maximum
extent
possible,
so
that--
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
--it
could
be.
we
would
suggest
that
the
act
has
been
very
expansive
in
providing
funding
and
the
impetus
for
training
personnel
for
innovative
teaching
techniques
for
looking
at
related
services
and
all
sorts
of
alternative
educational
programs
to
deal
with
and
address
the
handicaps
of
these
children.
one
would
hope
that
they
would
not
take
the
sort
of
low
risk
alternative
of
simply
returning
to
the
1975s,
where
as
this
court
recognized,
handicapped
children
were
simply
warehoused,
or
segregated
in
separate
programs.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
that
is,
of
course,
always
the
problem.
ms.
sheila
l.
brogna
that
is
an
assumption
we
have
always
made
also,
but
it
is
predicated
upon
the
school
district
offering
in
good
faith
a
reasonable
alternative.
again,
i
have
to
remind
the
court
that,
in
this
case,
no
such
alternative
was
offered
to
the
plaintiffs.
in
fact,
no
discussion
of
related
services,
no
discussion
of
alternative
programs
was
ever
proposed,
and
we
suggest
that
makes
the
difference.
in
viewing
the
comprehensive
nature
of
this
statute,
i
would
finish
by
saying
that
the
court's
order
under
the
direction
of
1414(d)
that,
in
some
circumstances,
the
state
department
of
education
would
be
held
responsible
for
provision
services
to
a
handicapped
child
directly
is
in
keeping
with
this
comprehensive
nature
and
purpose
of
the
statute,
that
above
and
beyond
all
else,
handicapped
children
should
receive
an
education.
we
submit
that
1414(d)
does
contemplate
a
situation
exactly
like
what
happened
in
1980
in
san
francisco
when
you
have
a
local
school
district
unwilling
to
follow
the
law;
unwilling
to
maintain
a
handicapped
student
in
the
current
placement;
unwilling
to
abide
by
the
provisions
of
(e)(3)...
we
believe
it
was
correct
for
the
district
court
to
say
that
in
circumstances
such
as
that,
the
state
department
as
the
ultimately
responsible
agency,
must
step
in,
provide
education
to
that
handicapped
child
in
the
interim,
to
ensure
that,
regardless
of
which
agency
is
ultimately
responsible,
the
child,
at
least,
does
not
suffer
a
lack
of
education
while
the
dispute
is
being
resolved.
thank
you.
