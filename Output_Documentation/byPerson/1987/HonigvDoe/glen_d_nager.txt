mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
primarily
for
the
reasons
stated
by
petitioner,
the
united
states
agrees
that
the
court
below
misconstrued
the
"stay-put"
in
the
direct
services
provisions.
even
if
petitioner
is
wrong,
we
submit
that
the
answer
can
only
be
because
the
courts
below
erred
on
a
remedy
that
they
issued
as
relief
for
the
asserted
violations.
this
court
in
burlington
said,
"in
devising
a
remedy
for
a
violation
of
the
eha,
a
court
should
always
keep
in
mind
the
principle
overriding
the
objective
of
the
eha,
which
is
the
provision
of
free
appropriate
public
education
in
the
least-restrictive
environment
possible
for
all
our
nation's
handicapped
children.
"
the
decision
below
deserves
that
congressional
objective
and
does
so
in
the
following
two
senses:
first,
if
school
administrators
are
required
to
maintain
the
placement
of
a
dangerous
child
pending
administrative
and
judicial
proceedings,
the
incentive
in
the
initial
iep
process
will
be
for
school
administrators
to
resist
the
placement
of
any
child
who
has
a
perceived
risk
of
dangerousness
in
a
mainstreamed
environment.
there
are
under
this
statute
many
children
who
have
a
risk
of
dangerousness.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
will
act
out
those
tendencies
of
dangerousness.
we
do
not
know
until
they
are
in
the
placement.
if
school
administrators
are
told
"you
cannot
take
them
out
once
they
act
on
it.
"
they
will
not
put
them
there
in
the
first
place,
and
many
more
children
will
be
deprived
of
the
benefits
of
this
statute,
the
principal
objective
of
the
mainstream
environment
than
would
be
the
case
if
the
"stay-put"
exception
were
not
so
rigidly
applied
as
it
was
by
the
ninth
circuit
as
it
was
in
this
case.
a
similar
point
can
be
made
with
respect
to
the
direct
services
provision.
the
child's
iep
is
determined
on
the
local
level.
more
often
than
not...
indeed,
in
the
principal
number
of
cases,
the
least
restrictive
environment
will
be
on
the
local
level.
if
the
local
agency
defaults,
the
appropriate
remedy
is
to
order
the
local
education
agency
who
did
the
iep
and
has
the
direct
services
available,
to
provide
them.
the
state
acts
in
a
supervisory
capacity
and
should
be
held
to
order
the
local
education
agencies
to
provide
those
services,
but
the
appropriate
guns
placed
to
the
local
educational
agencies'
head,
not
to
the
state
agency's
head.
let
me
move
to
each
point
in
a
little
bit
more
detail:
this
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions
that
equitable
relief,
such
as
injunctive
relief
and
declaratory
relief,
should
not
issue
as
a
matter
of
course.
the
court
has
recognized
that
congress
can
and
sometimes
does,
restrict
a
court's
equitable
discretion,
but
it
had
said,
given
the
history
of
equity
practice,
that
the
court
will
not
find
the
congress
has
restricted
the
equitable
jurisdiction
of
a
court
unless
congress
says
so
in
explicit
words.
and
we
submit
that
there
are
no
such
explicit
words
to
be
found
in
the
eha.
specifically
we
would
refer
the
court
to
20
u.s.c.
1415(e)(2),
which
is
the
remedial
provision
of
the
statute.
that
is
the
section
of
the
statute
which
says
that
"a
court
may
order
any
appropriate
relief.
"
this
court
in
burlington
said
that
is
a
broad
grant
of
discretion
to
courts.
and
we
submit
that
the
"stay-put"
provision
was
not
intended
and
does
not
limit,
the
discretion
with
which
a
court
may
determine
what
is
an
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
can
give
a
series
of
possibilities,
justice
stevens.
an
alternative
placement
would
have
been
one
which
would
have
best
simulated
the
placement
that
the
child
was
currently
in
with
the
qualification
that
it
would
have
reduced
and/or
eliminated
the
risk
of
dangerousness
to
other
children
or
to
the
child.
for
example,
a
smaller
classroom
with
closer
supervision
might
have
been
appropriate
as
an
interim
remedy.
1
it
may
have
been
that
only--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--yes.
yes,
we
believe
that
the
appropriate
procedure
for
the
district
courts,
since
this
case
we
do
believe
was
appropriately
in
the
district
court,
would
have
been
to
ask
the
parties
to
submit
proposals
for
alternative
placements,
and
the
district
court
should
have
reviewed
those
proposals
and
ordered
the
school
district,
assuming
there
was
a
violation
of
the
"stay-put"
provision,
to
put
the
child
in
the
placement
that
most
simulated
the--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
our
position
is
that
there
was
not,
because--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that
is
correct,
although
the
state...
the
local
education
agency
still
would
have
had
a
continuing
obligation
under
the
eha
to
provide--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--because
there
was
a
basis
for
claiming
that
the
children
were
dangerous
here,
it
is
correct
that
the
district
court,
we
did
not
believe,
should
have
directed
the
local
education
agency
as
to
which
alternative
placement
would
have
been
most
appropriate.
if
this
had
not
been
a
dangerous
child,
however,
and
the
school
had
tried
to
change
the
placement
of
the
child,
we
believe
that
there
would
have
in
fact
been
a
violation
of
the
"stay-put"
provision
and
the
district
court
should
have
awarded
an
appropriate
placement
would
be,
but
more
likely
than
not
it
would
have
been
to
order
them
to
put
the
child
back
in
the
classroom.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no,
and
that
is
part
of
our
point
in
this
case,
justice
marshall.
there
was
no
expert
testimony
put
in
by
the
plaintiff
when
she--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--on
either
side,
that
is
correct.
we,
just
like
the
state,
yes,
we
do.
that
is
part
of
our
point...
just
like
the
state,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
local
educational
agency
acted
properly
here.
we
believe
that
their
actions
frustrated
the
purposes
of
the
eha
as
much
as
the
district
court's
ultimate
remedy
and
the
court
of
appeal's
ultimate
judgment.
our
point
is
simply
that,
when
you
have
a
dangerous
child,
congress
did
not
remove
the
discretion
of
the
federal
courts
to
allow
the
school
to
safeguard
the
interests
of
the
other
children
in
the
classroom,
and
certainly
would
not
have
intended
that
an
equitable
rule
be
issued
such
that
in
the
future
all
school
administrators
within
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
would
resist
ever
placing
the
child
who
has
any
dangerous
tendencies
in
an
environment
where
the
child
might
act
out
on
those
dangerous
tendencies.
because
the
school
district
would
have
their
arms
tied
behind
their
back.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
short
answer
is
"yes",
justice
white.
we
do
not
believe
that
congress--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--no.
they
do
not
violate
the
"stay-put"
provision
by
suspending.
they
would
violate
the
eha
by
not
providing
an
appropriate
placement...
a
continuing
appropriate
placement
for
that
child.
now,
if
the
court
were
to
determine,
however
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
eha,
then
our
argument
which
we
presented
in
our
brief
would
kick
in
and
we
would
suggest
that,
nevertheless
even
thought
there
that
violation
would
be
a
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
order
the
child
to
be
placed
back
in
the
classroom
if
the
child
had
a
continuing
risk
of
dangerousness.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes.
the
qualification
being
that
if
the
iep
process
and
the
eha
review
procedures
because
it
is
in
that
process
where
the
correctness
or
the
appropriateness
of
the
procedure
should
be
determined.
however,
if
a
court
were
to
find
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
eh...
of
the
"stay-put"
provision
to
suspend
the
dangerous
child,
then
the
court
would
have
authority,
because
it
would
have
a
violation
of
the
statute,
to
require
the
parties
to
bring
in
expert
testimony,
so
it
could
determine
as
best
it
could
what
the
best
interim
placement
would
be,
because
it
would
have
authority
to
issue
some
remedial
order.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
united
states
is
inclined
to
believe
that
it
is
moot.
the
reason
why
i
say
"inclined",
is
because
as
amicus
we
really
do
not
have
access
to
the
facts.
it
is
clearly
moot
in
ordinary
mootness
principles
in
the
sense
that
this
is
a
question
about
interim
relief
and
the
children
ultimately
went
through
the
iep
process
and
had
a
final
placement.
but
under...
in
terms
of
capable
repetition
yet
evading
review,
there
is
no
circumstance
in
which
it
could
be
capable
of
repetition.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes,
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
sovereign
immunity
for
the
state;
there
was
a
settlement
with
regard
to
the
local
school
district
with
regard
to
damages;
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
qualified
immunity
for
the
state
officials.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
not
to
my
knowledge,
justice
white.
in
the
local
education
is--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i
believe
they
have
already
been
paid,
but
i
am
not
privy
to
the
information
whether
the
monies
have
been
forthcoming.
the
local
education
agency
that
made
that
settlement
did
not
petition
to
this
court
and
is
not
a
party
before
the
court.
the
question
of
mootness
would
be
with
respect
to
the
parties
before
the
case.
the
only
plaintiff
who
it
could
be
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review
is
respondent
jack
smith,
and
respondent
jack
smith
is
20
years
old
and
is
no
longer
in
the
public
school
system,
unless
respondent's
counsel
is
going
to
represent
to
this
court
that
he
intends
to
enter
into
the
school
system,
we
do
not
say
it
is
capable
of
repetition
yet
capable
of
evading
review.
thank
you
very
much.
