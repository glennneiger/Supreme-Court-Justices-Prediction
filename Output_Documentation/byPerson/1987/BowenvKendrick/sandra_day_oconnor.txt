justice
o'connor
mr.
fried,
is
it
possible
that
as
applied
this
statute
would
meet
the
hunt
v.
mcnair
standard
that
you
want
us
to
apply?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
do
our
cases
tell
us
we
should
do
if
we
think
a
statute
might
be
constitutional
on
its
face
but
not
as
applied,
and
if
the
evidence
is
there,
to
establish
that?
justice
o'connor
that
it
is
unconstitutionally
applied.
justice
o'connor
is
that
how
the
court
has
handled
aid
to
parochial
schools?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
mcconnell,
do
our
cases
support
the
view
that
public
funds
may
be
used
to
teach
secular
subjects
in
parochial
schools
to
teenagers?
justice
o'connor
does
this
statute,
in
your
view,
contemplate
that
parochial
schools,
for
instance,
could
be
grantees
in
these
programs?
justice
o'connor
but
it
would
contemplate
that
a
parochial
school,
for
instance,
could
be
a
grantee
and
teach
these
subjects
in
pregnancy
prevention
with
federal
funds.
justice
o'connor
and
it
is
your
position
that
as
so
interpreted,
it
can
be
upheld
under
our
precedents?
justice
o'connor
ms.
benshoof,
do
you
think
that
the
statute
would
survive,
in
your
view,
if
there
were
additional
statutory
or
administrative
proscriptions
against
the
misuse
of
government
for
non-secular
purposes?
justice
o'connor
it
says,
as
appropriate.
