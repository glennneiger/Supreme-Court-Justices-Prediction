justice
stevens
mr.
fried,
can
i
ask
you
one
question
about
the
procedure?
i
guess
there
were
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
were
there
not?
justice
stevens
and
i
did
not
understand
you
to
be
arguing
that
the
case
should
be
sent
back
for
trial,
but
rather
that
the
record
is
adequate
to
decide
the
case
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
stevens
is
it
your
view,
then,
that
some
of
the
facts
that
the
district
court
thought
were
undisputed
are,
in
fact,
disputed?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
but
mr.
mcconnell,
is
that
different
from
a
grant
that
says
it
can
go
to
religious
organizations
provided
the
religious
beliefs
are
of
a
certain
kind?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
because
your
brief
has
a
good
deal
of
factual
material
in
it
that
the
district
court
did
not
refer
to,
do
you
refer
to
any
of
those
29
disputed
facts,
or
do
you
rest
entirely
on
the
undisputed?
justice
stevens
but
what
you
are
telling
me...
just
to
make
sure...
is
that
what
you
described
as
factual
in
your
brief
is
within
the
limits
of
those
that
the
district
court
regarded
as
undisputed?
