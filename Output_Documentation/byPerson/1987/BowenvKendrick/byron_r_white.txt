justice
white
but
there
have
been
no
findings
by
the
district
court
on
which
to
sort
the
ones
that
are
constitutionally
suspect
and
those
that
are
not.
justice
white
ms.
benshoof,
the
government
suggests
that
you
do
not
really
defend
the
standard
that
the
district
court
used,
is
that
right?
justice
white
what
standard
do
you
think
the
district
court
applied
here?
justice
white
suppose
none
of
the
grants
had
ever
been
to
religiously
affiliated
organizations
that
were
pervasively
religious.
the
district
court
would
still
have
struck
the
statute
down,
wouldn't
it?
justice
white
so
your
submission
here
is
that
it
just
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
these
religiously
affiliated
organizations
were
pervasively
religious
or
not?
