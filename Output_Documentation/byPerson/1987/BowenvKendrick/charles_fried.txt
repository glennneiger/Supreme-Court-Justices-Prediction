mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1981
congress
passed
the
adolescent
and
family
life
act
in
response
to
what
it
considered
the
grave
social,
economic,
and
health
consequences
of
early
adolescent
pregnancy
and
childbirth.
it
undertook
to
enlist
the
aid
of
a
wide
variety
of
community
groups
to
combat
this
problem
in
providing
the
assistance
of
federal
grants
for
two
kinds
of
services:
prevention
services,
aimed
at
discouraging
adolescent
sexual
relations,
and
care
services,
directed
principally
at
pregnant
adolescents,
and
intended
to
give
among
other
things,
services
of
the
following
kind:
pregnancy
testing,
health
services,
prenatal
and
postnatal
care,
venereal
disease
screening,
psychological
and
nutritional
counseling,
and
a
wide
variety
of
other
services.
congress
sought
to
draw
on
the
widest
possible
range
of
community
resources,
and
therefore
specifically
provided
that
among
the
class
of
grantees
should
be
included
religiously
affiliated
organizations
where
appropriate.
though
religiously
affiliated
organizations
have
participated
without
question
throughout
our
history
in
the
care
and
counseling
services
funded
at
all
levels
of
government
in
areas
such
as
juvenile
delinquency,
runaways,
drug
addiction,
physical
and
mental
health,
foster
care,
adoption,
and
aging,
the
district
court
struck
down...
on
its
face
and
as
applied
as
violating
the
establishment
clause...
this
act
insofar
as
it
specifically
adverted
to
the
inclusion
of
religiously
affiliated
organizations
within
the
class
of
permissable
grantees.
the
district
court's
standard
and
reasoning
was
such
that
i
think
no
one
in
this
court...
not
us
and
not
the
plaintiffs
and
their
amici...
defend
it.
the
district
court
found
a
valid
secular
purpose
here,
and
properly
so,
but
found
that
the
act
had
the
primary
effect
of
advancing
religion,
thereby
failing
the
second
prong
of
the
lemon
test,
because...
and
i
am
quoting
here...
of
its
use
of
religious
organizations
for
education
and
counselling
of
teenagers
on
matters
relating
to
religious
doctrine.
we
pressed
on
the
district
court
and
renew
the
argument
here
that
the
correct
standard
for
determining
whether
a
law
has
the
effect
of
advancing
religion
has
been
set
out
many
times
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
perhaps
most
neatly
in
the
decision
of
hunt
v.
mcnair,
where
it
was
said
that
aid
has
the
effect
of
advancing
religion
if,
and
i
quote,
"it
flows
to
an
institution
in
which
religion
is
so
pervasive
that
a
substantial
portion
of
its
functions
are
subserved
in
the
religious
mission,
or
if
it
funds
a
specifically
religious
activity
in
an
otherwise
substantially
secular
setting.
"
and
i
suppose
examples
of
that
would
be
stone
v.
graham
or
abington
school
district
v.
schempp.
instead
of
applying
this
familiar
test,
the
district
court
held
that
its
quite
original
and
unprecedented
test
should
be
applied,
at
least
where,
as
in
this
act,
this
statute
explicitly
adverts
to
religion.
the
district
court
thereby
was
able
to
reach
its
conclusion
that
the
act
was
unconstitutional
without
making
any
of
the
findings
of
fact
which
would
be
necessitated
by
the
established
decisions
of
this
court,
because
it
found
that
its,
and
i
quote,
"more
neatly
put
test"
allows
it
to
strike
this
statute
down
on
summary
judgment
on
its
face
and
on
the
pleadings.
this
odd
state
of
affairs
explains
the
unusual,
i
believe
unusual
submissions
of
this
court
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff
and
their
amici.
mr.
charles
fried
it
certainly
is
possible.
it
is
certainly
possible
that
this
statute
could
provide
for
grants
to
religiously
affiliated
organizations
which,
nonetheless,
like
the
religiously
affiliated
organizations
in
hunt,
in
tilton,
in
roemer,
nevertheless
were
not
pervasively
sectarian.
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
grants
which
are
funded
would
be
grants
which,
unlike
the
activities
in
schempp
or
stone
v.
graham,
are
not
specifically
religious
activities.
both
of
those
things
are
entirely
possible,
and
indeed
not
only
possible,
in
our
view
on
proper
fact
finding
it
would
be
demonstrated
they
were
what
happened.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
it
constitutionally
applied.
mr.
charles
fried
if
it
is
unconstitutionally
applied,
then
i
think
the
question
becomes,
is
it
capable
of
being
constitutionally
applied?
well,
plainly,
by
answering
the
first
question
in
the
affirmative,
then
what
must
be
done
is
that
the
relevant
authorities
must
be
directed
to
cease
applying
the
statute
in
an
inappropriate
way.
that
is
what
has
happened
with
title
i--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
believe
if
you
look
at
the
most
recent
instances,
aguilar
and
grand
rapids,
title
i,
here
was
a
general
program
which,
it
turns
out,
a
number
of
states
were
not
applying
in
an
appropriate
way.
the
court
so
found
those
applications
inappropriate.
and
what
has
happened
is
those
applications
were
condemned,
and
now
title
i
is
still
alive
and
well,
and
it
is
being
applied
differently,
for
instance,
at
this
time.
those
remedial
services
which
this
court
said
could
not
be
provided
within
parochial
schools
by
public
school
teachers
coming
in,
are
being
provided
on
premises
separate
from
the
parochial
schools
to
parochial
school
children.
now
those
cases
are
also
in
litigation,
but
nevertheless,
the
secretary
believes
that
he
is
acting
faithfully
to
the
dictates
of
this
court.
so
that,
i
think,
is
how
matters
have
proceeded.
there
are
certain
programs,
and
i
think
schempp
would
be
a
perfect
example,
but
also
programs
which
have
provided
for
aid
to,
quote,
92
per
cent,
85
per
cent,
very
large
percentages
of
the
eligible
schools
were
so
pervasively
sectarian
that,
really,
there
was
no
room
for
constitutional
applications,
or
no
substantial
room.
that,
i
think,
is
how
the
matter
has
proceeded
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
that
is
how
i
think
it
should
proceed
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
fried
in
our
brief
we
said
that
there
were
some
departures,
but
i
don't
think,
justice
kennedy,
it
is
correct
to
say
there
were
any
findings
of
any
sort
in
the
district
court.
this
was
on
summary
judgment,
and
what
we
had
is
a
sort
of
comprehensive
wave
of
the
hand
in
the
direction
of
some
of
the
often
quite
disputed
evidence.
but
that,
i
don't
think,
constitutes
conscientious
fact
finding
such
as
congress
is
entitled
to
before
one
of
its
statutes
is
struck
down.
the
departures
to
which
we
are
referring
are
noted
on
page
41
of
our
brief.
we
do
not
dispute
that
there
may
well
have
been
departures.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
think--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
think
that
some
of
those
departures
are
departures
not
only
from
what
the
secretary
was
directing,
but
also
departures
from
a
fairly
tight
reading
of
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
it
is
not
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
arrive
at
an
entirely
comprehensive
test
based
on
everything
that
this
court
has
said
in
all
of
these
many
cases,
and
therefore
you
can
read
the
cases
tightly,
or
you
can
read
them
in
a
way
that
is
a
little
bit
more
generous.
we
are
proscribing
a
perfectly
conservative
reading
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
under
the
conservative
reading
we
say,
these
are
indeed
constitutionally
troublesome,
and
we
don't
seek
to
defend
them,
and
the
secretary
did
not
seek
to
authorize
them.
we
don't
think
that
is
what
is
part
of
what
we
are
here
defending.
mr.
charles
fried
plainly
not.
we
simply
don't
want
to
overstate
the
state
of
the
record,
justice
white.
the
record
is
very
voluminous
here,
and
for
us
to
tell
you
that
it
does
not
contain
some
things
which
are
questionable
and
perhaps
over
the
line
would
be
an
impermissible
exaggeration,
and
it's
entirely
unnecessary
to
our
case
to
indulge
in
it.
mr.
charles
fried
it
would
be
most
unusual;
this
is
not
an
original
action.
i
can't
imagine
why
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
make
findings.
indeed,
i
have
considerable
sympathy
for
the
situation
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
because
unable,
i
believe,
to
defend
the
judgment
below
on
the
basis
of
the
court's
more
neatly
put
rule...
that
is
to
say,
the
rule
which
it
invented...
it
is
forced,
really,
to
ask
this
court
to
make
the
necessary
factual
findings
which
would
support
a
judgment
in
their
favor
under
the
more
familiar
standards
which
this
court
has
set
out.
i
think
that
is
what
explains
the
fact
that
the
appellee's
brief
is
so
largely
devoted
to
fact,
and
why
they
return
to
the
facts
in
a
document
which
i
can
only
describe
as
their
reply
to
our
reply
brief.
we
cannot
get
into
those
facts,
and
we
don't
think
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
to
do
so
either.
mr.
charles
fried
there
were.
mr.
charles
fried
if
that
is
your
impression,
we
have
mislead
you,
justice
stevens.
our
view
is
that
the
summary
judgment
should
be
reversed.
we
did
not
appeal
from
the
denial
of
our
own
motion
of
summary
judgment.
if
the
summary
judgment
is
reversed,
the
case
then
will
proceed
in
the
ordinary
course
to
fact
findings
and
judgments
and,
i
hope,
a
judgment
guided--
mr.
charles
fried
--absolutely.
mr.
charles
fried
most
definitely
so.
if
the
court
wishes,
i
could
detail
at
considerable
length
where
the
court
has
simply
acted
most
inappropriately
in
finding
things
undisputed
which
were
vigorously
disputed.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
that
was
done,
and
we
then
set
forth
in
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
those
facts
that
we
thought
were
disputed.
now,
the
district
court
absolved
itself
from
the
further
labors
that
an
extensive
file
would
have
entailed
by
saying
that
we
had
not
mentioned
the
matters
in
dispute
with
sufficient
particularity.
it
is
very
embarrassing
to
bring
a
matter
like
this
to
this
court,
a
dispute
as
to
whether
a
local
rule
was
followed
or
not.
in
ordinary
course
this
is
a
matter
which
a
court
of
appeals
would
take
care
of
rather
readily.
unfortunately,
we
did
not
have
the
luxury
of
asking
a
court
of
appeals
to
direct
the
district
court
to
perform
its
functions
in
a
proper
and
conscientious
fashion.
unfortunately,
that
is
a
task
which
we
cannot
help
but
ask
this
court
to
perform,
because
the
direct
appeal
is
our
only
recourse.
otherwise,
the
statute
falls.
now,
in
our
view
the
statute
is
plainly
constitutional
on
its
face.
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
religiously
affiliated
organizations
are
necessarily
pervasively
sectarian.
if
that
were
so
then
roemer,
hunt,
and
tilton
would
have
been
wrongly
decided.
there
is
one
particular
equation
which
the
district
court
leapt
to
which
must
be
corrected,
and
that
is
the
notion
that
the
activities
here
are
specifically
religious
because
the
counselling
and
the
care...
which
would
be
given
by
the
religiously
affiliated
organizations,
though
for
a
proper
secular
purpose
and
though
without
any
reference
to
religion...
is
for
those
religious
persons
inspired
by
their
own
religious
convictions.
that,
surely,
is
a
novel
and
very
dangerous
proposition,
and
one
which
i
don't
think
can
be
seriously
entertained.
i
suppose
that
the
society
of
friends,
when
it
performs
services
for
refugees
and
seeks
to
further
the
cause
of
world
peace,
does
so
because
of
their
religious
inspiration,
and
yet
nobody
would
think
that
assisting
some
of
that
work
would
violate
the
establishment
clause
because
it
could
not
be
done
in
an
appropriately
secular
way
simply
because
those
doing
it
are
doing
it
with
a
personal
religious
inspiration.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
fried
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
indicate
that
the
joint
appendix,
justice
kennedy,
has
an
affidavit
from
father
bruce
ritter,
who
is
the
president
of
covenant
house
and
an
afla
grantee,
setting
out
the
programs,
and
that
was
available
to
the
district
court
on
the
summary
judgment
motions.
i
think
the
heart
of
the
difference
between
ms.
benshoof
and
ourselves
came
out
pretty
clearly.
i
think
the
plaintiffs
are
distressed
at
the
abortion
and
family
planning
limitations
in
this
act.
that
is
what
troubles
them.
they
do
not
accept
the
judgment
of
this
court
in
maher
and
harris.
that
is
the
heart
of
the
difficulty,
because
from
that
premise,
which
is,
of
course,
an
inadmissable
one,
they
conclude
that
any
organization,
if
religiously
affiliated,
while
it
might
otherwise
not
become
pervasively
sectarian,
it
becomes
pervasively
sectarian
if
that
religious
organization
has
doctrinal
limitations
which
coincide
with
the
limitations
which
congress
put
into
this
act.
therefore,
a
hospital
becomes
pervasively
sectarian
in
the
mind
of
the
plaintiffs
because
it
has
doctrinal
limitations
on
abortion
and
family
planning
methods,
which
coincide
with
limitations
which
this
court
had
said
congress
may
put
on
the
provisions
of
those
very
same
services
by
any
federal
grantee.
now--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
is
not
all
right
with
federal
money
to
say
you
may
not
have
premarital
sex
because
it
is
a
sin.
i
agree
with
that.
