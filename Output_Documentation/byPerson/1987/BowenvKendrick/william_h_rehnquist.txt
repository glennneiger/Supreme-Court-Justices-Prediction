mr.
fried,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcconnell,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcconnell.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
benshoof.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say,
ms.
benshoof,
that
one
would
judge
this
statute
after
ten
years
of
operation
just
the
same
way
you
would
judge
it
on
the
day
it
was
enacted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
you
would,
then,
judge
it
the
same
way
after
ten
years
of
operation
as
you
would
on
the
day
it
was
enacted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
chief
executive
officer
of
a
sectarian
hospital
was
personally
very
religiously
motivated?
would
that
prevent
him
from
playing
any
part
in
the
administration
of
a
grant
that
the
hospital
got?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
only
people
have
beliefs
in
the
long
run.
i
mean,
buildings
don't
have
beliefs,
organizations
without
people
don't
have
beliefs.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
there
is
an
administrative
prohibition
of
use
for
religious
purposes,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
that
fact
that
it
is
administrative
rather
than
statutory
affect
your
judgment
of
the
program?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
court
meant
that
the
case
would
have
come
out
differently
had
the
statute
not
been
amended?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
opinion
there
say
that
had
they
only
been
administrative
and
not
statutory,
the
result
would
have
been
different?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
benshoof.
general
fried,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
fried,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
and
the
first
of
them,
bowen
against
kendrick,
no.
87-253
and
others
concerns
when
in
1981,
congress
adopted
the
afla,
the
american
family
life
act
to
authorize
federal
grants
to
public
or
private
organizations
for
services
and
research
in
the
area
of
premarital
adolescent
sexual
relations
and
pregnancy.
the
act
provides
that
grantees
must
furnish
certain
types
of
services
to
adolescents
including
various
types
of
counseling
and
education
services.
congress
recognized
that
the
complexity
of
the
problems
associated
with
teenage
sexuality
requires
the
involvement
of
religious
and
charitable
organizations,
voluntary
associations,
and
other
groups
in
the
private
sector,
as
well
as
government
agencies
and
therefore,
emendated
that
prospective
grantees
describe
how
they
would
involve
such
organizations
including
religious
organizations
and
the
provisions
of
service
under
the
act.
the
act
also
provides
that
federal
funds
may
not
be
used
for
certain
purposes
including
family
planning
services
and
the
promotion
of
abortion.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
ruled
that
the
american
family
life
act
was
invalid
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied.
the
court
ruled
that
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
prevented
any
involvement
by
religious
organizations
in
the
federally
funded
programs.
we
now
reverse
the
district
court
and
hold
that
the
family
life
act
is
not
invalid
on
its
face.
we
apply
the
three
prong
standard
first
announced
in
lemon
against
kurtzman
and
hold
first
that
the
act
has
a
valid
secular
purpose
of
eliminating
or
reducing
the
social
and
economic
problems
associated
with
teenage
sexuality,
pregnancy,
and
parenthood.
as
of
the
second
prong
of
lemon,
the
effects
test,
we
hold
that
the
act
on
its
face
does
not
have
the
primary
effect
of
advancing
religion.
the
act
does
not
require
to
grantees
be
affiliated
with
any
religious
denomination
and
the
services
provided
under
the
act
are
not
religious
in
character.
we
have
never
held
that
religious
organizations
are
prevented
from
being
involved
in
the
federal
grant
program
that
provides
aid
neutrally
to
both
sectarian
and
non-sectarian
institutions.
finally,
we
do
not
think
that
the
act
violates
the
entanglement
prong
of
the
lemon
test,
although
monitoring
of
grantees
will
be
necessary
to
ensure
that
public
money
is
spent
in
the
way
that
congress
intended,
and
in
a
way
that
comports
with
the
establishment
clause.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
monitoring
is
of
such
a
type
that
will
cause
the
government
to
intrude
unduly
in
the
day-to-day
operations
of
the
religiously
affiliated
grantees.
the
district
court
also
struck
down
the
act
as
applied.
in
regard
to
this
claim,
we
first
find
that
the
appellees
have
standing
to
raise
an
establishment
clause
challenge.
as
to
the
merits
of
the
challenge,
we
conclude
that
the
district
court
did
not
follow
the
proper
approach
in
assessing
the
claim
that
the
secretary
is
making
grants
under
the
act
that
violate
the
establishment
clause.
although
the
record
contains
evidence
of
specific
incidence
of
impermissible
behavior
by
certain
grantees,
we
remand
the
case
for
further
consideration
of
the
evidence
insofar
as
it
sheds
light
on
the
manner
in
which
the
statute
is
being
administered.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
kennedy
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan,
marshall,
and
stevens
have
joined.
