ms.
janet
benshoof
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
first
like
to
address
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
because
i
believe
that
the
answer
the
solicitor
gave
was
dead
wrong.
her
question
was
what
do
we
do
when
we
are
shown
some
unconstitutional
applications
of
a
statute,
which
most
certainly
has
happened
in
this
case,
probably
more
than
any
other
case
reviewed
by
this
court.
this
is
a
facial
challenge,
and
facial
assessments
have
been
the
rule
of
this
court
even
when
statutes
have
been
applied
for
ten
or
twenty
years,
and
even
when
trial
courts
have
upheld
them
on
as
applied
grounds,
as
the
trial
court
did
in
meek
v.
pittenger.
in
fact,
out
of
over
thirty
cases
heard
by
this
court
since
1947,
only
one
was
labeled
a
narrow,
as
applied
holding,
and
that
was
hunt
v.
mcnair.
justice
powell
said,
i
am
only
calling
it
as
applied
in
this
case
because
the
south
carolina
legislature
hasn't
worked
out
the
details
of
the
statute
yet.
nevertheless,
despite
the
fact
that
the
court
has
always
looked
at
the
facial
assessments,
it's
done
so
because
the
standard
in
establishment
clause
cases
is
different
than
in
other
kinds
of
constitutional
cases.
you
can
look
at
the
language
of
the
first
amendment
to
see
that
difference.
the
language
says
laws
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion,
and
therefore
this
court
has
always
looked
for
the
certainty
that
it
will
not
so
advance
religion,
or
the
risk
and
potential
in
a
statute.
ms.
janet
benshoof
i
think
after
ten
years
of
operation
you
would
have
stronger
proof
that
it
is
certain
to
do
so.
in
fact,
only
last
term
in--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--yes.
you
might
have
stronger
proof
after
ten
years.
in
houston
v.
hill
last
term,
this
court
struck
down
a
statute
on
its
face,
and
the
same
issue
came
up
that
is
before
the
questions
today...
the
questions
to
the
solicitor.
and
that
was,
what
do
we
do
with
the
evidence
of
the
actual
application
when
we
are
looking
at
a
facial
statute.
this
court
specifically
said
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
that
case
in
looking
at
whether
the
statute
was
overbroad.
in
looking
at
the
evidence
in
concluding
that
how
the
statute
had
been
enforced
demonstrated
a
significant
potential
for
the
unconstitutional
application
of
the
statute.
ms.
janet
benshoof
that's
right.
ms.
janet
benshoof
that's
right.
in
the
establishment
clause
area,
it
is
a
one
way
look
for
a
very
particular
reason.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
aguilar
v.
felton,
there
are
a
lot
of
factors
that
would
hide
the
risk
or
potential.
for
example,
who
is
going
to
bring
up
the
unconstitutional
applications
when
a
program
is
in
being,
the
parochial
school
children,
the
parents,
the
people
who
are
getting
the
money?
ms.
janet
benshoof
well,
the
basis
was
described
by
this
court
in
your
majority
opinions
both
in
grand
rapids
and
in
aguilar,
where
you
said
the
fact
that
there
had
been
no
proof
in
18
years
of
unconstitutional
application,
that
didn't
mean
that
there
wasn't
a
high
risk,
and
that
there
were
certain
factors
mitigating
against
those
kinds
of
unconstitutional
applications
being
brought
to
the
forefront.
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
question
about
the
fact
finding,
because
i
think
some
misstatements
were
made
to
this
court.
in
the
district
court
there
were
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
the
government
never
argued
that
there
were
any
disputed
facts.
the
plaintiff
submitted
1,251
undisputed
material
facts
backed
up
by
a
plethora
of
deposition
evidence
taken
around
the
country.
sixty
per
cent
of
these
were
written,
admitted,
by
the
government,
right
on
the
face,
and
only
29
of
those
facts
did
the
government
dispute
and
put
in
any
kind
of
evidence,
and
those
were
not
found
legally
relevant
by
the
district
court.
so
this
is
not
a
question
where
there
are
disputed
facts.
and
rule
52
makes
it
very
clear
that
in
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
it
is
not
up
to
the
trial
court
to
decide
disputed
facts
and
make
findings
of
fact.
in
fact,
that
is
an
improper
role.
nevertheless,
that
doesn't
make
our
whole
list
of
undisputed
facts
irrelevant
to
this
court.
they
are
there
in
the
record.
the
district
court
judge
said
he
found
that
they
were
properly
put
in
the
record,
they
were
backed
up
by
evidence,
and
they
are
sitting
in
the
record
for
whatever
relevance
they
may
be.
they
are
certainly
cumulative.
ms.
janet
benshoof
we
rest
entirely
on
the
undisputed
facts.
we
could
have
rested
on
20
per
cent
of
the
facts
that
we
put
in.
i
mean,
we
showed
such
unconstitutional--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--absolutely.
the
district
court
regarded
1,215
facts
as
undisputed,
and
i
don't
think
we
put
in
a
quarter
of
those
in
our
brief.
ms.
janet
benshoof
no,
i
don't
think
so
for
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
this
is
a
unique
demonstration
project
by
congress.
they
wanted
to
try
something
new,
and
they
said
there
are
certain
limitations
of
the
government
in
dealing
with
moral
issues,
let's
try
something
new.
and
it
calls
for
religious
participation
explicitly
in
four
places.
now,
we
argue
that
the
statutory
language
requires
all
applicants
to
involve
religions,
even
if
you
are
secular.
and
although
this
is--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--yes,
although
this
is
disputed
by
the
government,
the
district
court,
hhs,
grant
applicants
themselves,
and
the
1984
senate
committee
all
agreed
with
our
interpretation.
however,
our
argument
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
doesn't
hinge
on
whether
it
is
mandatory
or
optional.
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
religious
organizations
are
eligible
for
grants,
and
they
are
listed
as
desirable
participants.
ms.
janet
benshoof
well,
we
agree
it
is
as
appropriate
in
the
delivery
of
their
services,
not
whether
or
not
they
want
to
have
them.
we
think
it
is
whether
or
not
where
they
want
to
put
them
in,
and
every
applicant
we
investigated,
secular
or
religious,
had
it
in
there,
and
we
put
that
evidence
before
the
court.
and
in
fact,
if
you
look
back
at
the
1981
legislative
history,
they
said,
what
is
a
model
program?
and
a
model
program
was
one
where
public
school
children
would
be
released
from
school
to
go
to
churches
to
receive
federally
funded
sex
education.
that
was
the
kind
of
model
program
congress
envisioned.
as
you
see,
there
was
certainly
a
joint
endorsement
between
religion
and
churches
that
congress
envisioned.
ms.
janet
benshoof
absolutely
not.
of
course
they
could
adopt
self-restraint.
they
just
can't
do
it
by
ways
of...
for
example,
one
grantee
teaching
young
girls
to
pretend
that
jesus
is
their
date.
ms.
janet
benshoof
when
we
are
talking
about
teaching
itself,
this
court
has
always
said
that
the
entanglement
problems...
even
if
you
had
a
statute
that
separated
the
sectarian
from
the
secular,
which
this
statute
doesn't...
are
too
much,
particularly
with
these
kinds
of
religiously
sensitive
values.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
government
admitted
below
all
of
our
expert
affidavits
from
religious
theologians
saying
that
these
values
could
be
secular.
when
you
put
the
values
of
chastity,
intercourse,
masturbation,
marriage
into
the
hands
of
religious
authority,
it
is
going
to
be
very
hard,
and
i
think
we
proved
impossible,
for
religious
organizations
to
teach
them
in
a
secular
way.
ms.
janet
benshoof
obviously,
our
public
schools
teach
a
lot
of
values;
we
all
know
that.
we
also
feel
that
there
is
a
lot
of
interplay
in
the
public
school
situation
that
leads
to
democratic
pluralism:
different
school
boards,
public
libraries,
no
dictates
on
the
care.
that
is
a
good
example,
because
i
think
if
the
public
schools
want
to
teach,
for
example,
aids
education,
and
abstinence
would
be
a
major
factor
in
that,
but
if
they
would
give
that
to
religious
authorities,
and
religious
authorities
would
not
mention
condoms
or,
as
some
of
our
programs
do,
say
such
things
as
condoms
cause
birth
defects,
in
order
to
discourage
teenagers
from
learning
about
condoms,
that
that
would
certainly
would
be
a
religious
rule
that
prevented
secular
teaching
on
abstinence.
we
are
not
saying
that
chastity
cannot
be
a
secular
value.
it
certainly
can
be,
and
there
are
very
good
secular
reasons
to
teach
it.
but
in
the
hands
of
religious
authority
there
is
not
just
a
possibility
that
it
might
be
misused,
we
have
certainly
proven
that
it
has
been
misused.
ms.
janet
benshoof
we
did
extensive
discovery
on
the
1981
and
the
1982
grantees.
the
covenant
house
was
not
one
of
our
grantees.
whether
or
not
that--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--the
district
court
said
that
you
should
use
a
functional
definition
of
a
religious
organization.
whether
the
ymca
and
harvard
university
are
still
religious--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--they
might
have
filed
a...
i
don't
know.
the
district
court
judge...
they
were
not
in
his
opinion
because
they
were
not
a
grantee
at
the
time.
there
is
no
discovery--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--if
they
have
religious
dictates
on
the
kind
of
care
funded
under
this,
if
they
counsel
teenage
girls,
but
they
will
not
give
information
that
even
the
statute
allows
you
to
give
because
of
religious
reasons,
if
there
is
a
religious
override
on
their
secular
care,
and
they
do
educational
programs
that
are
governed
by
religious
dictates,
yes,
they
are.
but
that
is
no
before
the
court
today.
ms.
janet
benshoof
that
would
depend
what
statute
they
are
doing
the
drug
counselling
under,
whether
the
secular
and
the
sectarian
are
separate--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--if
they
have
religious
guidelines
on
how
they
discourage
drug
use,
such
as
tell
people,
as
one
grantee
did
in
this
program,
that
using
drugs
means
the
devil
is
wasting
your
body,
that
satan
will
strike
you
down,
most
certainly
they
could
not.
ms.
janet
benshoof
absolutely,
because
every
religious
organization
that
got
funding
when
we
did
discovery
was
operating
under
religious
dictates
whether
they
were
religious
themselves
or
not.
for
example,
in
st.
margaret's
hospital,
all
the
employees
of
this
program
had
to
sign
a
statement
that
they
would
follow
religious
dictates.
one
midwife
who
was
counselling
teenage
girls,
for
example,
who
asked
her,
may
i
have
sex
during
pregnancy,
she
thought
that
was
a
medical
question
and
she
said
yes.
she
was
chastised
and
almost
lost
her
job
because
she
was
told
that
she
was
supposed
to
give
a
religious
answer
to
the
medical
question.
so
certainly,
funding
most
hospitals
would
be
absolutely
constitutional,
but
if
you
funded
a
hospital
run
by
the
jehovah's
witnesses
to
counsel
for
a
hemophiliac
ward,
in
which
they
would
counsel
against
blood
transfusions
and
not
offer
them...
not
send
them
elsewhere,
that
would
raise
some
very
serious
establishment
clause
questions.
ms.
janet
benshoof
absolutely
not.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
personal
beliefs
of
people.
obviously,
public
school
teachers
may
be
very
religious.
ms.
janet
benshoof
but
people
operate
under
religious
dictates
that
they
may
or
may
not
believe
in.
the
evidence
of
this
case
shows
that
many
of
the
employees
in
these
programs
did
not
operate
under
the
beliefs
that
they
were
forced
to
force
on
teenage
girls,
who
didn't
share
those
beliefs
either.
ms.
janet
benshoof
it
depends
whether
or
not
that
affects
the
degree
of
the
religious
delivery
of
services
or
not.
obviously,
there
could
be
many
secular
universities
that
are
run
by
very
religious
people,
but
that
doesn't
affect
their
eligibility
for
federal
aid,
and
we
are
not
claiming
that
it
would.
ms.
janet
benshoof
no,
you
misconstrue
my
answer.
obviously,
there
is
going
to
be
religious
counselling
whether
you
fund
a
drug
program
for
just
secular
grantees
or
sectarian
grantees.
but
when
you
are
funding
a
religiously
affiliated
organization
to
do
teaching
and
counselling,
and
they
happen
to
have
religious
mandates
on
that
very
same
issue,
that's
the
kind
of
danger
that
raises
the
risk
or
potential
or
advancing
religion
which
the
establishment
clause
prohibits.
but
i
think
another
things
is
very
important
to
consider
in
the
answer
to
that
question,
and
that
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
statute...
your
questions
all
rest
on
some
hypothetical
statute
that's
not
before
the
court.
if
you
look
at
the
congressional
history,
they
wanted
a
union
between
government
and
religion,
it
calls
for
religious
participation,
and
it
has
nothing
in
the
statute
that
precludes
the
teaching
or
advancing
of
religion.
now,
this
is
all
the
more
telling
in
the
fact
that
there
are
25
other
prohibitions
and
limitations
on
grantees
in
the
statute.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
federal
statute
that
funds
educational
institutions,
both
sectarian
and
secular,
that
doesn't
have
even
one
statutory
guarantee.
in
fact,
the
solicitor
was
mentioning
about
title
i,
which
aguilar
was
not
an
as
applied
case,
because
this
court
didn't
even
take
it
under
1252
jurisdiction,
it
was
only
a
challenge
to
the
program
in
new
york.
title
i
on
its
face
was
never
challenged
in
aguilar.
but
title
i
itself,
in
which
only
four
per
cent
of
$4
billion
went
to
sectarian
organizations,
had
on
its
face
of
the
statute
four
statutory
guarantees
trying
to
see
that
when
we
fund
an
educational
program,
that
taxpayers
money
doesn't
go
to
fund
a
sectarian
enterprise.
ms.
janet
benshoof
absolutely,
and
that
is
deficient
for
four
reasons.
ms.
janet
benshoof
yes,
it
does,
and
i
think
it
has
affected
this
court's
judgment
in
the
past.
for
example,
in
tilton
v.
richardson
there
was
a
prohibition
that
eight
members
of
this
court
struck
out
that
said
after
<twenty>
[=
20]
years
we
are
going
to
take
out
keeping
the
secular
from
the
sectarian,
and
you
struck
out
that
provision
and
said
it
had
to
be
in
the
statute.
if
it
could
just
be
an
administrative
regulation,
or
if
it
was
constitutionally
required
so
that
you
could
just
read
it
in,
it
wouldn't
have
been
necessary
to
strike
that
down.
similarly,
in
another
college
aid
case,
roemer,
in
footnote
23
this
court
cited
approvingly
the
fact
that
the
maryland
statute
had
been
amended
to
put
the
statutory
prohibitions
in
the
statute
and
not
in
the
regulation.
ms.
janet
benshoof
yes,
and
in
fact,
justice
white,
when
he
wrote
the
opinion
in
regan
upholding
a
new
york
statute
that
gave
parochial
schools
reimbursement
for
state
mandated
tests,
that
case
took
care
of
a
problem
that
this
court
had
struck
down
in
levitt
where
there
were
no
statutory
guarantees,
and
justice
white
made
it
quite
clear
that
if
those
kinds
of
guarantees
were
not
in
the
face
of
the
statute,
the
outcome
of
the
case
would
have
been
different.
ms.
janet
benshoof
no,
they
didn't,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
isn't
even
really
administrative.
that
this
is
not
a
regulation,
it's
not
a
guideline,
it's
not
in
the
statute,
and
yet
25
other
things
are
in
the
statute.
all
it
is
is
a
grant
condition
that
was
put
in
after
we
filed
the
lawsuit
and
after
we
wrote
a
brief
saying
that
this
was
necessary,
then
the
government
put
it
in,
and
it
has
never
enforced
it.
in
fact,
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
government,
they
put
726
facts
before
the
district
court,
and
only
four
of
them
had
anything
to
do
with
monitoring
a
statutory
condition.
ms.
janet
benshoof
you
have
never
upheld
that
in
the
establishment
clause
area,
and
i
believe
it
is
because
of
the
very--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--well,
in
a
sense
you
have,
because
in
cases
such
as
levitt
when
it
wasn't
clear
that
the
state
mandated
test
would...
when
you
gave
the
money
to
the
parochial
school,
it
would
only
be
used
for
that.
you
could
have
inferred
that
in
or
remanded
it
for
a
regulation,
but
instead
you
made
the
new
york
state
legislature
decide
it,
it
came
back,
and
then
you
upheld
it
in
the
regan
decision.
so
you
have
had
chances
to
infer
it
in
and
have
never
inferred
in
regulations
or
given
that
discretion.
i
think
that
is
because
of
the
words
of
the
first
amendment
establishment
clause
itself,
and
because
your
standard
has
always
been,
we
must
have
certainty
that
there
is
no
risk
or
potential.
ms.
janet
benshoof
well,
the
problem
with
dwelling
on
the
fact...
i
think
the
importance
of
the
fact
of
the
administrative
regulation
for
this
case
is
not
that
it
would
constitutionalize
anything,
but
its
importance
is
to
show
how
inadequate
it
has
been.
in
fact,
although
it
says
you
shall
not
teach
or
promote
or
religion,
they
never
once
defunded
or
not
funded
an
organization
because
of
that.
when
st.
margaret's
hospital
taught
catholic
doctrine
in
parochial
schools
for
a
year
and
a
half...
and
we
caught
them
at
that
during
the
deposition...
all
that
happened
was
that
hhs
wrote
them
a
letter
and
said
that
your
teaching
catholic
doctrine
on
religion
is
susceptible
under
the
establishment
clause
of
advancing
religion,
take
out
the
words
catholic
and
you
can
use
the
curriculum
in
the
public
schools,
and
then
they
got
a
total
of
$2
million,
almost,
in
aid.
secondly,
the
solicitor
seems
to
feel
that
pervasively
sectarian
is
a
major
problem
as
to
what
the
institutions
are,
and
yet
not
once
in
seven,
not
once
did
hhs
ever
question
the
religiosity
of
any
institution
receiving
aid
under
the
statute.
in
fact,
brigham
young
university,
they
submitted
26
facts
on
showing
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
their
$2
million,
but
not
one
fact
on
whether
or
not
that
institution
was
so
pervasively
sectarian
it
shouldn't
get
any
aid
at
all.
and
not
only
that,
they
admitted
all
of
plaintiff's
evidence
on
how
brigham
young
university
lowered
tuition
for
students
who
were
mormons,
required
mormon
classes
for
everybody
who
went
there--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--that
is
absolutely
incorrect.
the
district
court--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--the
district
court
said
that
this
statute
violated
the
primary
effects
doctrine
in
five
ways,
and
it
violated
the
entanglement
doctrine
in
two
ways.
the
five
ways,
it
said,
was
that,
first
of
all,
because
on
the
face
of
the
statute
it
calls
forward
for
religious
participation
and
encouragement
giving
religious
applicants
an
edge.
from
the
face
of
the
statute
there
is
a
direct
and
immediate
effect.
it
said
there
is
an
endorsement
which
again
should
invalidate
it
under
primary
effects.
it
said
that
there
is
no
statutory
guarantees
on
the
face
of
the
statute
keeping
the
sectarian
from
the
secular,
and
that
is
another
way
it
violates
the
primary
effect.
it
says
because
the
nature
of
the
aid
is
so
close
to
religious
doctrine,
that
is,
teaching
chastity...
premarital
chastity,
that
is...
and
marriage,
masturbation,
abortion,
because
that
is
so
close
to
religious
doctrine
that's
another
reason.
ms.
janet
benshoof
yes,
because
the
pervasively
sectarian
doctrine
developed
by
this
court
in
the
college
aid
case
is
certainly
not
the
heart
of
the
establishment
clause
jurisprudence,
it
is
only
a
shorthand
way
to
know
it
you
should
go
ahead
and
look
at
other
factors.
i
mean,
the
other
factors
are
what
is
the
nature
of
the
aid
and
what
is
the
relationship
between
the
government
and
the
program
that
is
being
created
here.
and
certainly,
inspecting
curriculums
on
chastity
and
sexuality
is
much
more
of
an
invasive
relationship
than
in
tilton,
where
you
had
to
just
audit
to
see
if
they
used
a
construction
grant.
ms.
janet
benshoof
it
doesn't
make
a
difference,
but
i
think
that
the
government
has
also
used
a
wrong
definition.
i
think
when
you
look
at
whether
or
not
an
institution
is
pervasively
sectarian,
you
have
to
look
at
a
functional
definition.
you
know,
what
does
it
mean
in
the
context
of
this
program.
obviously,
in
1899,
when
this
court
upheld
funding
bradford
hospital
for
a
diphtheria
ward,
nobody
would
really
have
said
that
is
a
pervasively
sectarian
hospital.
but
when
there
are
religious
dictates
on
what
they
can
say
and
do
on
these
particular
items
funded
under
this
act,
reproductive
health
care
and
sex
education,
when
you
look
at
those
dictates
on
this
portion
of
the
hospital
program,
then
the
pervasively
sectarian
certainly
takes
on
a
different
tenor.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
the
senate
committee
report
stated
that
congress'
reason
for
doing
this
was
that
religion
doesn't
suffer
some
of
the
limitations
of
government
in
dealing
with
the
problem
that
has
such
complex
moral
dimensions.
in
other
words,
religion
can
help
us
shape
the
morals
of
citizens.
well,
this
was
precisely
the
reason
in
1784
that
patrick
henry
wanted
to
tax
christian
teachers.
he
said
we
should
pay
the
salary
because
the
diffusion
of
christian
knowledge
has
a
tendency
to
correct
the
morals
of
men
in
this
country.
now,
this
proposal,
of
course,
was
soundly
rebutted
in
madison's
memorial
and
remonstrance.
twenty-five
years
ago
in
abington
v.
schempp,
this
court
equally
rejected
the
rationale
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
that
said
that
bible
reading
would
serve
that
same
secular
purpose,
that
bible
reading
would
promote
moral
values
of
citizens
and
contradict
the
materialistic
trends
of
our
times.
for
over
200
years
this
country
has
ensured
religious
liberty,
protected
religious
pluralism,
and
minimized
political
divisiveness...
and
this
is
a
very
competitive
program...
by
rigorously
enforcing
the
first
amendment.
by
finding
the
adolescent
and
family
life
act
unconstitutional,
this
court
furthers
the
original
intent
of
the
framers,
that
religious
instruction
and
indoctrination
are
not
within
the
scope
of
congress'
power
to
tax
and
spend
for
the
general
welfare.
thank
you.
