justice
scalia
you
concede
that
all
of
those
departures
were
not
just
departures
from
the
regulation,
but
were
unconstitutional?
justice
scalia
because
in
that
respect
i
think
you
diverge
from
the
private
appellant
here.
justice
scalia
is
it
available
to
us
to
make
any
additional
factual
findings
that
are
necessary?
there
were
a
lot
of
facts
put
in
down
there.
justice
scalia
that
shouldn't
be
too
hard
to
identify,
shouldn't
it?
the
district
court,
like
most
district
courts,
has
a
rule
that
requires,
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
that
the
party
making
it
set
forth
those
facts
that
that
party
believes
to
be
undisputed.
justice
scalia
but
you
can't
look
at
that
evidence
to
demonstrate
that
it
doesn't
have
a
significant
unconstitutional
application.
justice
scalia
sort
of
a
one
way
look
at
subsequent
practice:
it
can
hurt
you
but
it
can't
help
you.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
if
we
can
look
to
the
practice
and
the
application
of
it
in
order
to
determine
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
we
ought
to
be
able
to
look
to
them
to
determine
that
it
is
constitutional
as
well.
i
don't
see
any
basis
for
looking
at
only
the
evidence
on
one
side.
justice
scalia
ms.
benshoof,
let
me
ask
you
this:
you
don't
contest,
i
don't
think,
that
congress
can
lawfully
adopt,
as
a
purpose,
encouraging
and
inculcating
in
the
young
sexual
self-restraint?
that
is
not
your--
justice
scalia
--now,
let
me
put
the
worst
case
scenario
to
you
that
was
suggested
by
justice
o'connor.
suppose
the
government
explicitly
decided
to
do
this
by
funding
programs
in
the
schools?
do
you
think
the
constitution
requires
that
the
government
can
fund
such
programs
in
all
public
schools,
but
cannot
fund
them
in
any
sectarian
schools?
the
same
programs
inculcating
sexual
restraint.
justice
scalia
you
can
have
other
organizations
who
have
the
opposite
values
that
can
teach
those
values,
even
if
the
people
that
are
teaching
them
are
religiously
motivated.
that
is,
if
they
say,
well,
use
contraception,
or
use
birth
control,
or
use
abortion,
that's
all
right.
justice
scalia
that
could
be
the
imposed
belief
of
the
director
as
well
as
the
imposed
belief
of
the
institution.
i
mean,
you
are
just
referring
to
the
fact
that
there
are
superiors
and
inferiors
in
any
organization.
what
the
chief
justice
is
asking
is
why
does
the
fact
that
the
superiority
is
an
institutional
superiority
rather
than
just
a
personal
superiority,
which
everything
boils
down
to...
why
should
that
be
crucial?
justice
scalia
if
the
religious
belief
affects
the
ability
of
the
organization
to
implement
the
program
properly,
now,
that
certainly
is
a
different
question,
as
in
your
drug
testing
example.
but
you
are
not
limiting
it
to
that.
you
are
saying
that
even
if
the
religious
belief
does
not
at
all
impede
the
good
counselling
under
the
program,
simply
because
one
person
is
counselling
out
of
religious
conviction
and
another
person
is
counselling
the
same
thing
not
out
of
religious
conviction,
that
makes
the
difference.
justice
scalia
ms.
benshoof,
in
the
first
amendment
area
we
have
certainly
upheld
legislative
schemes
that
do
not
contain
in
the
statutes
sufficient
standards
to
guide
the
administrator's
discretion.
where
those
standards
are
supplied
by
a
regulation...
a
law
that
doesn't
say
that
the
mayor
has
to
make
his
determination
on
such
and
such
a
basis,
but
there
is
a
regulation
that
sets
forth
clear
statutory
standards,
we
have
allowed
that
to
satisfy
the
first
amendment
free
speech
clause,
why
wouldn't
it
satisfy
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
scalia
we
have
never
had
occasion
to
address
it
in
the
establishment
clause
area--
justice
scalia
--we
are
not
talking
here
about
inferring
a
regulation;
we
are
not
talking
about
speculating
that
a
regulation
could
be
adopted;
we
have
one,
and
in
those
other
cases
we
didn't
have
any.
justice
scalia
in
fairness,
general
fried,
i
think
it
is
more
than
that.
i
think
that
they
would
say
not
just
the
limitations
but
even
the
affirmative
goals
of
the
program,
if
those
goals
are
pursued
for
religious
reasons,
that
that
would
be
disqualifying.
in
other
words,
it's
quite
all
right
to
say
you
should
not
have
premarital
sex,
but
it
is
not
all
right
to
say
you
should
not
have
premarital
sex
because
it
is
a
sin.
