justice
kennedy
were
there
any
findings
in
the
district
court
where
you
would
concede
in
this
case
that
there
were
some
unconstitutional
applications?
justice
kennedy
should
the
court,
on
remand,
determine
whether
any
of
these
organizations
are
pervasively
sectarian,
or
is
that
an
improper
test?
justice
kennedy
is
the
covenant
house
a
religious
authority?
that
is
the
institute
that
takes
care
of
15,000
homeless
a
year
in
about
six
major
cities.
justice
kennedy
well,
as
you
know
they
are
founded
by
the
franciscans,
but
they
are
open
to
all
people,
and
the
district
court's
rationale,
as
i
understood
it
from
page
34
of
the
record,
was
that
this
is
a
religious
organization
that
may
not
give
this
kind
of
program.
justice
kennedy
what
about
the
covenant
house?
they
filed
an
amicus
brief
here.
are
they
a
religious
organization,
in
your
view?
justice
kennedy
they
are
founded
by
the
franciscans,
and
suppose
they
are
supervised
by
franciscan
fathers.
justice
kennedy
can
they
do
drug
counselling?
justice
kennedy
suppose
it
is
simply
a
statute
that
is
designed
to
discourage
drug
use
and
encourage
abstinence
and
avoidance
of
drugs.
justice
kennedy
do
you
agree
with
the
district
court
when
it
said
that
to
presume
that
counsellors
from
religious
organizations
can
put
their
beliefs
aside
when
counselling
an
adolescent
on
matters
that
are
a
part
of
religious
doctrine
is
simply
unrealistic?
