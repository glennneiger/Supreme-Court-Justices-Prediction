mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
single
most
important
point
i
wish
to
make
this
morning
in
my
brief
ten
minutes
is
to
clarify
precisely
what
the
legal
question
in
this
case
is,
because
i
agree
with
solicitor
general
fried
that
the
many
factual
allegations
are
not
appropriately
before
this
court
on
an
appeal.
the
legal
question
is
whether
otherwise
qualified
private
organizations
must
be
excluded
from
the
adolescent
family
life
program
solely
on
the
basis
of
their
religious
affiliation
or
inspiration.
our
position
is
that
the
establishment
clause
does
not
require
and
the
free
exercise
clause
does
not
permit
religious
belief
or
affiliation
to
be
the
basis
for
a
civil
disability.
afla
grantees
must
be
judged
according
to
their
conduct
and
their
performance,
and
not
according
to
their
beliefs.
i
would
have
thought
that
cantwell
v.
connecticut
was
sufficient
authority
to
establish
that
proposition.
thus
the
issue
is
not
whether
some
grantees
may
have
violated
the
terms
of
the
grant
or
even
whether
the
terms
of
the
grant
are
binding
on
them;
those
are
not
disputed
questions
among
any
of
the
parties
in
this
court.
if
the
district
court
had
held
only
that
grantees
who
use
afla
funds
to
teach
or
promote
religion
must
be
disciplined,
and
in
appropriate
cases
perhaps
excluded,
we
would
not
be
here.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
no,
your
honor.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
programs
of
aid
to
parochial
schools...
which
are
predominantly
sectarian
institutions,
in
most
of
the
cases
before
this
court
over
95
per
cent
of
them
being
sectarian...
is
not
a
neutral
program
of
secular
education.
the
reason
for
that
seems
quite
evident.
even
though
the
description
of
the
program...
private
education...
may
sound
neutral
on
its
face,
in
fact
everyone
understands
that
the
institutions
involved
are
predominantly,
almost
exclusively
religious.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
suppose
so,
your
honor,
so
long
as
the
class
of
potential
grantees
includes
a
much
wider
category
than
just
parochial
schools.
the
problem
with
the
parochial
school
cases
is
that
the
aid
was
targeted--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--none
of
the
grantees,
in
fact,
have
been
parochial
schools,
but
i
am
not
aware
of
any
reason
why
they
would
be
excluded
as
one
of
a
much
broader
range
of
potential
grantees
under
the
program.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
test
of
pervasively
sectarian,
and
for
this
reason:
under
this
court's
definitions...
which
were,
frankly,
ignored
by
the
district
court...
a
pervasively
sectarian
institution
is
one
that
is
simply
incapable...
by
virtue
of
being
so
permeated
with
religion...
of
distinguishing
between
the
teaching
or
promotion
of
religion
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
carrying
out
of
secular
purposes
on
the
other.
such
an
institution
would
be
unable
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
grant,
which
are
legally
binding
in
this
case.
thus
the
exclusion
of
a
pervasively
sectarian
organization
is
not
on
the
basis
of
its
belief
or
affiliation,
but
on
the
basis
of
a
conclusion
about
its
conduct.
and
that
is
the
fundamental
point
which
i
wish
to
make
this
morning,
which
is
that
it
is
the
conduct
of
the
grantees
and
not
their
tie
to
religion
or
their
inspiration
of
religion
that
has
to
be
the
basis
for
judgment.
we
agree
that
religious
organizations,
like
everyone
else,
has
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
grant.
there
is
nothing
non-neutral
about
that,
but
neutrality,
again,
is
the
key.
this
is
a
program
in
which
congress
intended
and
then
the
secretary
has
administered
in
a
way
so
as
not
to
either
favor
or
disfavor
religious
organizations
as
such.
it
seems
rather
clear
to
us
that
the
way
in
which
to
be
neutral
in
these
matters
is
to
insist
upon
objective,
secular,
neutral
criteria
for
the
selection
of
grantees,
and
not
to
either
grant
a
grant
to
someone
because
they
are
religious,
or
to
deny
the
grant
to
the
same
organization
because
they
are
religious.
how
they
are
going
to
perform
the
secular
functions
of
the
program
has
to
be
the
key.
that
is
the
way
in
which
we
can
see
through
to
neutrality
in
a
case
like
this.
i
would
like,
if
i
could,
to
run
briefly
through
how
this
case
ought
to
be
viewed
under
the
lemon
test,
because
i
think
that
the
court
below
quite
misunderstood
the
lemon
test
in
this
context.
now,
the
court
did
find
that
this
program
has
a
secular
purpose,
and
i
don't
want
to
belabor
the
point,
because
obviously
we
agree
with
the
district
court
on
this
point.
however
it
is
important
to
note
appellee's
position.
while
they
do
not
directly
contradict
the
notion
that
this
statute
is
secular
in
purpose,
their
view
that
for
the
government
to
support
an
approach
to
sex
education
and
care
for
pregnant
adolescents
that
support
sexual
self-discipline
as
opposed
to,
say,
contraception
as
a
means
of
family
planning,
and
that
promote
adoption
and
care
as
opposed
to
abortion,
they
believe
that
that
is
itself
an
impermissible
purpose
because
those
beliefs
are
also
associated
with
the
views
of
some
prominent
religions.
now,
that
point
of
view
was
rejected
in
maher
v.
rowe,
and
more
pointedly
in
harris
v.
mcrae,
and
i
don't
want
to
repeat
that.
the
important
things
is
that
if
that
is
correct,
it
would
also
be
true
that
the
opposite
kind
of
sex
education
program
would
be
equally
impermissible
under
the
constitution.
if
it
is
impermissible
for
the
government
to
fund
sex
education
with
a
view
to
sexual
self-discipline,
it
would
be
equally
unconstitutional
for
the
government
to
fund...
as
it
does
in
the
title
x
program...
sex
education
with
a
view
toward
contraception.
we
do
not
take
this
position,
the
government
does
not
take
this
position,
and
i
cannot
really
believe
that
the
appellees
support
the
logical
conclusion
of
this
argument
about
purpose.
now,
as
to
effect,
the
important
thing,
according
to
the
lemon
test,
is
whether
the
program
as
a
whole
seeks
to
advance
or
infringe
religion.
here
the
question
is
does
the
program...
taken
as
a
whole,
not
concentrating
just
on
the
religious
aspects,
the
religious
grantees,
but
the
program
as
a
whole,
does
it
favor
religion
over
non-religion,
or
does
it
favor
non-religion
over
religion.
the
point
is
for
it
to
be
neutral,
not
for
it
be
stacked
in
favor
of
secular
grantees.
it
infringes
the
rights
of
religious
organizations
to
be
included
simply
on
the
basis
of
religious
affiliation,
just
as
it
would
infringe
the
rights
of
non-religious
organizations
if
religious
organizations
were
granted
a
preference.
as
to
the
issue
of
entanglement,
here
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
this
court
has
always
used
the
term
excessive
entanglement.
and
this
is
because
any
interaction
between
government
and
religious
organizations
inevitably
have
some
degree
of
entanglement.
the
question
is
excessive
in
comparison
to
what.
in
walz
v.
tax
commission,
being
the
first
case
of
this
court
that
invoked
the
notion
of
entanglement,
is
a
good
place
to
begin,
because
the
court
there
noted
that
there
were
problems
both
ways...
either
including
religious
organizations
for
tax
exemptions
or
excluding
them...
and
the
question
was
which
way
leads
to
the
least
damaging
constitutional
consequences.
here
appellees'
position
has
presented
us
with
a
choice.
either
we
can
exclude
all
organizations
solely
on
the
basis
of
their
religious
affiliation,
or
some
degree
of
monitoring
to
ensure
that
they
are
judged
on
the
basis
of
their
conduct
is
necessary.
it
is
our
belief
that
it
is
not
excessive
entanglement
for
a
program
to
be
administered
in
a
way
so
as
to
avoid
the
more
serious
constitutional
violation
of
a
flat
out
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
religious
affiliation
or
belief,
which
could
not
be
a
plainer
violation
of
the
free
exercise
clause.
if
congress
had
passed
a
statute
that
says
grants
are
going
to
be
available
to
all
voluntary
and
charitable
organizations
except
for
those
who
have
religious
beliefs,
this
court
would
not
have
any
hesitation
in
declaring
such
a
statute
unconstitutional,
either
under
the
free
exercise
clause
or
under
the
equal
protection
component
of
the--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--i
do
believe
that
those
are
quite
different
situations,
and
it
is
simply
not
true
that
this
program
gives
grants
only
to
organizations
with
beliefs
of
a
certain
kind.
an
organization
that
believes
in
abortion,
for
example,
is
perfectly
eligible
to
put
on
an
afla
program.
it
simply
may
not
urge
or
facilitate
abortions
in
the
context
of
the
program
itself.
it
is
free
to
do
with
its
own
money
and
in
its
other
operations
whatever
it
cares
to
do.
the
contrast
here
is
with
the
district
court's
judgment,
which
prevents
the
organization
from
pursuing
its
religious
purposes
even
with
its
own
funds,
and
in
its
own
way,
and
ways
that
are
not
promoted
by
the
afla
grant
itself.
