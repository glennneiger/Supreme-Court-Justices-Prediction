justice
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
that.
you
are
saying
the
rebuttal
could
be
used
to
prove
he
did
not
have
pneumoconiosis,
the
black
lung
disease
itself.
it
could
not
be
used
to
refute
the
conclusion
that
there
was
some
chronic
respiratory
and
pulmonary
disease?
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
stevens
well,
number
2.
justice
stevens
ventilatory
studies
establish
the
presence
of
a
chronic
respiratory
or
pulmonary
disease.
that
has
been
established,
and
the
presumption
therefore
is
triggered.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
now,
having
triggered
the
presumption,
may
they
offer
evidence
that
tends
to
disprove
that
narrow
fact,
that
there
was
the
presence
of
such
a
disease?
justice
stevens
why
wouldn't
the
doctor's
opinion
be
admissible
at
the
preliminary
stage
to
show
that
the
studies
do
not
in
fact
establish
the
conclusion
because
doctors
don't
interpret
them
that
way,
just
as
in
reading
x-rays
the
distinction
between
the
x-ray
and
the
interpretation
of
the
x-ray.
the
x-ray
doesn't
establish
it
unless
the
sum
opinion
of
all
those
who
looked
at
it,
at
least
the
preponderance
of
that
view,
supports
that
conclusion.
justice
stevens
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
to
comment?
one
of
your
opponents
emphasized
the
word
"establish"
in
the
regulation.
a
chest
x-ray
or
biopsy
establishes
the
existence
of
pneumoconiosis.
do
you
take
the
word
"establish"
to
mean
constitutes
some
evidence
tending
to
prove?
that
is
what
it
is.
justice
stevens
even
if
there
are
ten
other
x-rays
that
support
the
contrary
conclusion?
justice
stevens
i
thought
i
understood
this
before.
you
are
saying
that
the
one
isolated
piece
of
evidence
establishes
a
presumption
that
there
is
the
disease.
justice
stevens
and
in
addition
establishes
the
presumption
of
causal
connection
and
total
disability
and
all
the
rest.
justice
stevens
so
that
it
performs
two
functions
under
your
view.
under
their
view
it
performs
only
the
second
function,
because
you
have
proved
the
fact
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
the
presumption.
justice
stevens
yes.
and
you
think
the
word
"establish"
bears
your
reading.
i
have
difficulty
with
that.
i
am
just
looking
at
the
language.
that
is
all
i
am
doing
right
now.
justice
stevens
but
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent's
reading
of
the
word
"establish"
when
you
are
talking
about
rebuttal?
justice
stevens
you
mean
they
win
with
just
some
evidence
then?
