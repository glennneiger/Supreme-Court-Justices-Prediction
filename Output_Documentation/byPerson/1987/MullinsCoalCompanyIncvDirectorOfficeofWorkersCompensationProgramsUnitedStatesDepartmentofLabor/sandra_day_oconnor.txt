justice
o'connor
mr.
solomons,
i
am
a
little
unclear
how
this
argument
you
are
making
squares
with
what
the
sg
tells
us
is
the
true
doubt
rule
that
is
applied
in
these
cases,
and
i
would
like
you
to
tell
me
whether
you
are
suggesting
in
effect
or
implicitly
asking
us
to
say
there
isn't
any
such
thing
as
a
true
doubt.
or
would
that
be
the
effect
of
agreeing
on
this
burden
of
proof
question,
which
seems
to
me
a
little
different
from
the
question
of
what
the
trier
of
fact
should
consider
in
the
way
of
evidence.
aren't
you
going
beyond
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
we
even
have
to
decide
in
this
case
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
true
doubt
rule
and
the
burden
of
persuasion
issue
that
you
are
discussing?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
you
don't
want
us
to
judge
the
reasonableness
of
your
opinion
then,
as
the
government
has
argued
in
its
brief
on
this
point,
by
the
fact
that
after
all
when
all
else
fails
you
have
the
true
doubt
rule.
you
don't
urge
us
to
consider
that
residual
benefit
to
the
claimant
as
being
a
part
of
the
whole
scheme
which
we
approve.
justice
o'connor
mr.
kellogg,
does
the
true
doubt
rule
that
you
refer
to
in
the
brief
apply
at
the
interim
presumption
stage?
justice
o'connor
and
not
at
the
rebuttal
stage?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
can
you
say
in
one
breath
that
there
is
a
burden
of
persuasion
by
a
preponderance
and
yet
have
the
true
doubt
rule?
justice
o'connor
and
where
do
we
find
the
true
doubt
rule?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
see.
but
not
prove
that
he...
you
can't
use
it
to
prove
he
doesn't
have
a
respiratory
or
pulmonary
disease?
