mr.
c.
randall
lowe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
petitioner
asserts
that
the
administrative
agency's
interpretation
of
the
invocation
provision
at
203
is
reasonable
and
entitled
to
substantial
deference.
the
controlling
rule
in
this
matter
of
whether
the
administrative
interpretation
be
given
substantial
deference
is
whether
it
is
plainly
erroneous
or
inconsistent
with
the
regulation
or
clearly
frustrates
the
statutory
mandate.
the
fourth
circuit
in
reviewing
the
director's
interpretation
of
the
regulation
found
that
the
agency's
interpretation
renders
the
regulation
internally
inconsistent,
and
it
is
plainly
erroneous.
the
fourth
circuit
gave
a
clear
and
common
sense
ruling
to
203(a),
finding
that
a
coal
miner
who
shows
that
he
has
been
employed
in
a
coal
mining
employment
for
ten
years
will
have
the
benefit
of
the
presumption
that
he
suffers
from
pneumoconiosis
and
is
permanently
disabled
from
that
disease
if
he
shows
a
chest
x-ray
and
a
recent
medical
opinion
under
(a)1
and
(a)4.
they
found
that
the
clear
reading
of
that
regulation
shows
that
you
have
to
produce
only
one
single
piece
of
evidence.
as
to
(a)2
and
(a)3
on
ventilatory
studies
and
blood
gas
studies,
they
found
that
studies,
for
example,
in
ventilatory
studies
you
have
to
produce
three
different
tests
before
the
quality
standards
applied
in
the
statute
will
allow
that
to
be
a
valid
test.
so
they
also
found
that
you
only
had
to
produce
one
breathing
study.
the
petitioner
argues
that
that
construction
by
the
fourth
circuit
violates
the
black
lung
benefits
section
at
413(b)
and
that
all
relevant
evidence
is
not
considered
at
the
invocation
stage.
they
state
that
the
legislative
history
does
not
say
that
all
relevant
evidence
must
be
considered
only
at
the
rebuttal
stage,
and
we
would
argue
that
the
legislative
history
is
silent
on
that.
it
doesn't
say
which
stage
all
relevant
evidence
is
to
be
considered,
but
the
regulations
themselves
at
203(b)
states
that
all
relevant
evidence
shall
be
considered
at
(b).
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
well,
justice,
we
are
saying
that,
for
example,
x-ray
evidence,
if--
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
--yes,
we...
the
burden--
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
--the
problem
is,
they
speak
of
the
true
doubt
rule.
i
have
heard
of
it.
i
have
never
seen
it
applied.
the
true
doubt
rule
is
when
everything
is
exactly
equal,
then
the
doubt
goes
to
the
claimant.
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
the
problem
is,
who
carries
the
burden.
the
problem
that
we
are
finding
at
the
administrative
law
judge
level
is
a
coal
miner
is
treated
by
his
treating
physician,
who
might
have
ordered
one
or
two
x-rays,
determined
that
he
has
a
disease,
and
does
not
continue
granting
or
ordering
x-rays.
it
is
not
necessary.
but
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
the
coal
operator
will
come
in
and
have
sent
that
x-ray
to
ten
or
twelve
different
doctors
and
have
ten
or
twelve
negative
readings.
so
at
that
time
when
they
are
looking
to
see
under
(a)1
who
wins,
it
does
not
become
who
has
the
best
evidence,
who
has
the
quality
of
evidence,
it
becomes
a
numbers
game,
and
claimants'
attorneys
have
begun
to
call
it
a
numbers
game.
we
believe
that
by
invoking
just
one
piece
of
evidence
then
takes
the
burden
off
of
the
coal
miner
to
produce
all
this
substantial
amount
of
evidence.
it
then
puts
the
burden
upon
the
coal
operator
or
the
director
to
rebut
those
presumptions,
and
at
that
point,
as
the
fourth
circuit
had
ruled
in
reviewing
all
the
relevant
evidence,
then
the
court
looks
at
everything
that
the
coal
company
has
put
in,
and
using
the
director's
position,
where
they
say
that
all
like
kind
evidence
will
be
looked
at
at
(a)1
in
the
invocation
stage,
but
when
you
go
to
rebuttal
it
cannot
be
used
again,
it
clearly
shows
what
the
fourth
circuit
says.
under
their
interpretation
the
rebuttal
stage
is
superfluous.
take,
for
example,
the
x-rays.
if
you
weigh
all
the
x-rays
and
the
administrative
law
judge
finds
that
the
invocation
is
invoked
at
(a)1,
then
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
rebut
that
the
person
suffers
from
pneumoconiosis
because...
and
under
their
definition
in
(b)
they
cannot
reweigh
the
x-ray
reports.
even
a
doctor's
opinion
cannot
reweigh
the
x-ray
reports.
so
it
shows
that
the
fourth
circuit
is
right
in
that
the
rebuttal
was
superfluous.
it
conflicts
or
it
violates
203(b)
in
that
203(b)
directly
says
that
all
relevant
evidence
shall
be
considered.
and
i
would
also
suggest
that
in
that
case
it
makes
the
presumption
irrebuttable.
now,
the
basic
reason
that
the
fourth
circuit
believed
that
it
is
correct
is
because
of
the
legislative
history.
i
don't
believe
it
is
a
conflict
that
this
is
an
unusual
piece
of
legislation.
congress
has
singled
out
victims
of
one
industry
to
develop
a
program
that
would
benefit
them
from
a
disease
that
they
derive
from
that
industry.
congress
intended
the
program
to
be
extremely
liberal.
they
intended
that,
for
the
most
part,
that
the
burden
be
upon
the
code
operator
or
the
director,
and
under
the
circuit
court's
construction
of
this
regulation
the
miner
could
raise
the
presumption
of
totally
disabling
pneumoconiosis
with
a
minimum
of
evidence.
then
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
shifted
to
the
director
or
the
code
operator
to
go
forward
and
produce
the
evidence
where
they
are
in
a
better
position
to
do
that.
the
procedure
avoids
placing
on
the
miner,
who
can
least
afford
it,
the
burden
of
responding,
at
least
initially,
to
a
plethora
of
medical
evidence
more
easily
generated
by
the
operator,
and
again,
that
is
in
what
we
call
the
numbers
game,
the
code
operator
has
the
ability
by
going
out
and
contacting
doctors,
in
report
after
report,
to
completely
overwhelm
the
coal
miner,
and
the
director's
interpretation
of
this
regulation
allows
that
to
happen.
it
completely
wipes
out
the
remedial
intention
of
the
legislation
of
the
congress.
as
far
as
the
apa
act
applying,
we
find
it
interesting
that
on
one
hand
the
petitioner
would
ask
that
you
follow
the
director's
interpretation
of
the
regulations,
but
he
does
not
accept
the
director's
interpretation
does
not
apply,
but
at
any
rate,
i
believe
that
the
section
which
incorporates
the
apa
and
the
black
lung
act,
30
usc
932(a),
specifically
states
that
it
may
be
excluded
by
regulations
of
the
secretary.
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
sir?
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
we
would
state
that
under
(a),
that
the
(a)
and
(b)
show
what
you
have
to
produce
for
the
persuasion
to
be
shifted
to
the
code
operator
or
the
director,
and
then
under
(b),
with
all
relevant
evidence
to
be
considered,
it
sets
forth
a
showing
that
all
evidence
or
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
rule
will
then
be
applied,
so
before
any
decision
or
final
decision
is
made
by
an
arbitrator,
in
this
case
administrative
law
judge,
the
preponderance
evidence
is
applied.
the
federal
respondent
cites
this
court's
case
of
nlrb
versus
transportation
management
for
that
proposition
that
under
section
7(c)
of
the
administrative
procedures
act
the
question
is
that
before
an
agency's
decision
is
made,
that
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
be
weighed,
and
here
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
has
to
be
at
the
invocation
stage.
the
invocation
stage
is
to
determine
who
will
carry
the
burden
of
proof.
if
it
is
shifted,
then
the
evidence
is...
all
the
evidence
is
weighed
under
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard,
but
that
burden
is
upon
the
code
operator
or
the
director.
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
it
means
one
study,
justice,
but--
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
--well,
but
under
the
context
of
the
regulation
it
takes
three
studies
to
make
one.
you
have
to...
it
is
a
complicated
process.
apparently
they
put
them
through
three
tests
and
you
have
to
submit
the
results
of
the
three
tests
and
the
tracings
from
the
three
tests
or
it
will
not
be
accepted.
that
is
one
ventilatory
study.
so
the
fourth
circuit,
and
i
would
agree,
saying
studies
just
means
that
you
have
three
studies
but
that
only...
that
only
makes
up
one
ventilatory
studies
under
the
regulations.
the
same
thing
for
blood
gas
studies.
if
you
have
ever
seen
a
blood
gas
study,
it
just
has...
it
has
values
and
numbers,
just
probably
15
or
20
that
all
combine
to
make
up
that
one
blood
gas
study
that
you
apply
under
the
charts
under
(a)2
and
(a)3
to
see
if
you
invoke
the
presumption.
in
conclusion--
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
--well,
no,
justice,
i
would
disagree.
that
is
the
basic
threshold.
if
they
cannot
produce
enough
evidence
to
invoke
the
presumption,
then
therefore
you
would
not
go
any
further.
basically,
if
you
could
not
produce
one
single
x-ray
that
would
show
you
suffer
from
pneumoconiosis,
then
apparently
you
don't
have
any
x-rays.
what
i
am
saying
is,
what
the
fourth
circuit's
interpretation
that
the
minimal
amount
of
evidence
you
would
have
to
prove
is
so
low
that
i
believe
if
you
could
not
even
prove
that
that
your
claim
would
not
go
any
further,
because
you
would
not
have
any
evidence
at
all.
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
not
under
203(a).
you
can...
x-ray--
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
--but
under
203
those
are
the
only
things
that
you
can
offer
to
prove
that
you
suffer
from
pneumoconiosis
and
that
you
are
disabled.
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
there
are
other
regulations
you
can
turn
to,
but
if
you
can't
get
it
here
i
don't
think
in
reality
you
are
going
to
get
it
at
all.
usually
the
last
paragraph
of
the
administrative
law
judges'
opinions
say,
we
have
considered
the
evidence
under
such
and
such
a
section
and
such
and
such
section,
but
if
you
can't...
if
you
can't
produce
enough
under
the
fourth
circuit's
interpretation
to
invoke
the
presumptions
under
section
(a),
i
do
not
believe
that
you
are
going
to
qualify
for
any
of
the
other
regulatory
provisions.
in
conclusion,
i
would
ask
that
you
adopt
the
interpretation
of
the
fourth
circuit,
in
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
given
a
common
sense
reading
to
20
cfr
727.203(a)
and
(b),
and
they
have
reviewed
the
legislation
and
interpreted
that
legislative
history
to
give
the
coal
miner
the
remedial
nature
of
the
act
that
they
intended.
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
i
would
take
that
to
mean
that
the
x-ray,
based
upon
the
standard
that
the
x-ray
has
to
be
in,
which
is,
1/0
is
the
first
step
to
show
that
you
have
pneumoconiosis,
i
would
take
that
to
mean
that
that
x-ray
shows
or
proves
that
you
have
pneumoconiosis,
that
it
is
not
negative.
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
supports
the
contrary,
it
is
our
position
that
your
presumption
is
invoked
and
then,
unlike
the
director
in
not
being
able
to
look
at
any
other
x-ray,
we
believe
that
under
(b)
we
look
at
all
of
the
evidence
then
and
determine
if
those,
if
in
the
administrative
law
judge's
opinion
those
other
nine
x-rays
show
that
you
do
not
have
pneumoconiosis.
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
yes.
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
i
would
think
"establish"
means
"prove",
and
does
not
set
forth
a
burden
of
proof
of
preponderance
of
the
evidence
as
the
director
thinks
it
established.
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
no,
i
do
not
agree.
i
think
it
means
the
same
thing
in
rebuttal,
but
in
the
rebuttal
phase--
mr.
c.
randall
lowe
--203(b)
says
in
adjudicating
a
claim
under
this
subpart,
all
relevant
evidence
shall
be
considered,
and
i
think
under
(b)
that
is
where
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is
established
in
the
head
of
that
subpart.
it
tells
you,
at
this
point
you
are
now
to
consider
all
the
relevant
evidence
in
the
record.
and
i
don't
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
word
"establish".
thank
you.
