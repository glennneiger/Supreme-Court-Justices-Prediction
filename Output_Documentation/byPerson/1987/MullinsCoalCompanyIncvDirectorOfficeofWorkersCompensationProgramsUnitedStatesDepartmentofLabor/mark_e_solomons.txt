mr.
mark
e.
solomons
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
black
lung
benefits
act
is
a
federally
based
workers
compensation
program
which
provides
benefits
on
account
of
total
disability
or
death
of
a
coalminer
due
to
black
lung
disease.
hundreds
of
thousands
of
claimants
have
been
awarded
billions
of
dollars
in
benefits
in
this
program
by
proving
their
entitlement
to
these
benefits
under
a
regulation
which
is
called
the
interim
presumption.
since
its
inception
15
years
ago,
the
two
agencies
which
promulgated
and
have
administered
this
presumption,
the
social
security
administration,
and
after
them
the
department
of
labor,
have
required
proof
of
an
indication
of
fact
by
a
preponderance
of
the
relevant
evidence.
the
fourth
circuit
in
its
divided
opinion
below
strikes
down
the
preponderance
rule
for
invocation
of
this
presumption
and
replaces
it
with
a
new
rule
which
requires
invocation
on
virtually
any
evidence
at
all
in
isolation
from
the
record
and
whether
or
not
that
evidence
is
reliable
and
accurate.
the
fourth
circuit's
rule
is,
we
think,
unprecedented
in
the
context
presented.
it
effectively
strips
claim
defendants
of
the
right
to
answer
critical
evidence
where
it
is
most
significant
in
the
analysis
of
the
case.
we
think
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
one
party's
proof
in
an
important
point
in
the
case
is
simply
better
than
another'.
the
question
that
is
presented
here
for
this
court
is
whether
in
the
invocation
of
this
presumption
the
claimant
must
establish
invocation
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
we
think
that
he
must,
and
we
think
so
for
two
reasons.
first,
because
the
secretary
of
labor
has
consistently
and
over
a
long
period
of
time
required
claimants
through
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
its
regulation
to
establish
indication
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
secondly,
and
perhaps
more
importantly,
because
we
think
congress
has
spoken
on
this
issue
as
well
through
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
through
the
administrative
procedure
act
has
compelled
a
holding
that
the
invocation
of
a
presumption
of
this
sort
can
only
be
established
in
an
apa
proceeding
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
i
think
we
are
going
just
a
little
bit
beyond
the
true
doubt
rule.
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
recognize
that
the
true
doubt
rule
is
a
rule
which
is
very
rarely
applied
in
these
cases.
it
has
been
applied,
and
i
think
largely
without
contest,
in
a
case
where
there...
in
the
invocation
analysis
there
are
two
absolutely
equal
pieces
of
evidence,
and
the
administrative
law
judge
at
that
point
has
been
permitted
in
the
past
to
say,
i
will
resolve
these
doubts
in
favor
of
the
claimant.
the
precise
meaning
of
the
true
doubt
rule,
and
that
is
not
a
troubling
rule,
we
do
not
think
that
the
rule
is
precisely
in
accord
with
the
administrative
procedure
act,
because
we
think
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
the
claimant
is
required
to
prove,
at
least
in
the
invocation
analysis,
that
invocation
of
this
presumption
is
a
very
easy
task,
that
his
evidence
is
just
a
tiny
bit
better,
and
establish--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--well,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
there
is
a
true
doubt
rule.
this
was
not...
the
true
doubt
rule
was
not
presented
in
any
of
these
three
cases.
it
was
not
argued
in
the
fourth
circuit.
it
was
not
argued
before
an
administrative
law
judge.
it
just
doesn't
arise
here.
now,
i
think
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
suggest
that
what
you
hold
may
not
affect
it,
but
it
is
not,
i
think,
something
which
is
here.
it
is
a
different
question.
the
true
doubt--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--no,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
do
that.
i
think
that
there
are
arguments
pro
and
con
on
the
true
doubt
rule
as
they
may
be
applied
to
revise
the
effect
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
these
cases.
these
arguments
have
not
been
made
to
the
court
except
in
footnotes.
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
the
true
doubt
rule
is
absolutely
wrong.
i
think
it
is
important
in
understanding
how
this
presumption
works
to
look
at
its
mechanics
just
briefly.
an
award
of
benefits
under
this
program
requires
the
presence
of
three
statutory
elements.
first,
the
claimant
must
have
pneumoconiosis.
pneumoconiosis
is
a
statutory
term
which
is
defined
somewhat
more
broadly
than
the
medical
term
is
defined.
this
pneumoconiosis
or
this
disease
must
be
occupationally
caused.
and
the
disease
must
in
addition
to
that
result
in
the
total
disability
or
death
of
the
coalminer.
now,
when
you
take
this
in
the
context
of
the
interim
presumption,
what
we
find
is
that
the
invocation
of
the
presumption
presumes
that
all
three
of
the
statutory
elements
are
present,
but
invocation
facts
generally
do
not
prove
that
any
one
of
the
basic
elements
of
entitlement
are
present.
now,
there
is
one
exception
to
that
where
an
invocation
fact
may
prove
but
one
element
but
there
is
no
invoca...
fact
that
proves
two.
the
plain
language
of
the
regulation,
looking
both
at
the
invocation
and
rebuttal
provisions,
i
think
clearly
demonstrates
that
there
is
a
mismatch
between
the
invocation
facts
and
rebuttal
facts.
they
are
simply
not
the
same.
evidence
of
the
type
which
is
required
to
establish
invocation
of
the
presumption
typically
and
generally
cannot
prove
rebuttal,
but
even
more
important,
invocation
facts
are
not
rebuttal
facts.
the
claimant
could
establish
invocation
in
the
sorts
of
cases
that
are
presented
here
by
proving
but
one
of
several
simple
medical
facts,
that
he
has
an
x-ray,
a
biopsy
which
is
indicative
of
some
clinical
lung
disease,
or
that
he
has
ventilatory
studies
or
arterial
blood
gas
test
data
which
when
looking
simply
at
the
raw
data
is
indicative
of
a
chronic
impairment
of
respiratory
function,
or
that
there
is
physician
opinion
evidence
that
the
individual
is
totally
disabled
by
a
respiratory
or
pulmonary
impairment.
looking
at
these
three,
these
four
presumption
invocation
facts,
it
should
be
clear
that
perhaps
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
x-ray
fact,
which
could
be
established,
that
we
are
not
talking
about
the
basic
fundamental
elements
of
entitlement.
those
are
what
is
presumed.
the
invocation
facts
are
different.
this
is
not
a
bursting
bubble
presumption.
we
cannot
within
the
terms
of
the
presumption
come
back
in
the
rebuttal
phase
and
say
that
claimant's
invocation
evidence,
his
blood
gas
evidence
or
his
ventilatory
study
evidence
is
completely
false
or
invalid
because
it
proves
nothing.
it
does
not
prove,
as
we
are
required
to
do,
negative
of
one
of
the
three
basic
elements
of
entitlement
in
the
case.
after
invocation
on
rebuttal
we
are
looking
at
entirely
new
facts.
invocation
facts
are
left
behind
us
and
the
focus
changes
to
the
presumed
facts,
and
again
here
we
are
required
to
prove
the
negative
of
those
presumed
facts.
facts
are
decided
only
once.
you
decide
invocation
facts
in
the
invocation
phase.
you
decide
rebuttal
facts
in
the
rebuttal
phase.
there
is
very
little
interplay
between
the
two.
but
all
we
are
looking
for
here,
and
what
we
have
had
for
15
years
prior
to
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
is
the
right
to
participate
in
the
whole
case.
we
would
like
to
have
the
opportunity
to
cross
examine
and
litigate,
not
only
with
respect
to
the
rebuttal,
but
with
respect
to
the
invocation
of
the
presumption
as
well.
we
think
it
is
only
fair.
what
the
fourth
circuit's
rule
overlooks
is
this
fundamental
mismatch
between
the
invocation
and
rebuttal
facts.
and
in
so
doing
it
permits
evidence
which
we
can
prove
to
be
undeniably
false
to
in
many
cases
to
control
the
outcome
of
the
case.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
your
honor--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--justice
scalia,
we
might
be
able
to
in
one
circuit.
the
(a)
1
presumption
that
is
invoked
by
x-ray
evidence
in
one
circuit
has
been
found
rebuttable
on
the
basis
of
x-ray
evidence.
in
other
circuits...
that
is
the
seventh
circuit,
in
a
case
called
kuehner
versus
siegler
coal
company,
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
i
believe.
but
in
other
circuits,
the
third
circuit,
in
a
case
called
payasi,
we
can't
do
that,
because
we
have
to
prove
not
only
that
the
claimant
doesn't
have
clinical
black
lung
disease.
we
have
got
to
prove
that
he
does
not
have
a
statutory
disease,
statutory
black
lung
disease.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
no--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
you
are
right
about
their
position,
i
am
relatively
sure,
and
we
agree
with
it
completely.
all
we
are
asking
for
in
connection
with
the
invocation
inquiry
is
the
opportunity
to
have
like
kind
evidence,
whether
it
is
x-rays
or
ventilatory
studies,
considered
with
other
x-rays
and
ventilatory
studies.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
our
position
is
that
once
you
get
to
the
rebuttal
inquiry,
the
evidence
that
we
could
be...
that
is
properly
considered
in
the
invocation
inquiry
doesn't
have
much
of
a
place
once
you
finally
get
to
rebuttal.
it
doesn't
have
much
meaning.
it
is
not
totally
insignificant
or
irrelevant,
but
it
certainly
does
not
assist
in
proving
a
rebuttal
fact.
and
i
think
what
is
most
important
here
is
to
look
at
the
recent
fourth
circuit
decisions
in
their
efforts
to
apply
their
own
rule.
in
those
decisions,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
fourth
circuit
is
simply
not
considering
ventilatory
studies
or
blood
gas
studies
or,
for
that
matter,
even
physician
opinion
evidence
relating
to
the
individual's
respiratory
or
pulmonary
disease
in
the
context
of
the
rebuttal
inquiry.
they
refuse
to
do
it.
and
so
under
the
fourth
circuit's
rule
as
they
have
applied
it
today
there
is
simply
no
place
in
which
contradictory
evidence
has
a
place
to
be
considered.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
the
autopsy
is
considered
in
part
of
the
invocation
analysis
where
you
determine
whether
the
autopsy
by
itself
or
the
autopsy
in
conjunction
with
other
autopsy
reports
invokes
the
presumption.
it
doesn't
have
any
place
in
consideration
of
whether
ventilatory
studies--
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
--no,
you
cannot.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
right.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
what
you
can
do
with
an
autopsy
study
arguably
is
use
it
in
the
first
instance
to
determine
under
the
first
section
of
the
invocation
provision
whether
the
individual
has
coalworkers'
pneumoconiosis.
that
is
the
place
where
that
kind
of
evidence
is
listed
and
where
that
kind
of
evidence
ought
to
be
considered.
it
is
a
logical
and
orderly
pattern
where
like
kind
evidence
is
considered
with
other
like
kind
evidence
in
a
reasonably
logical
fashion
under
the
government's
rule
and
under
the
rule
that
we
are
espousing
here.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
evidence
which
is
in
mismatch
ought
to
be
considered
together.
what
we
are
suggesting
is,
and
the
original
argument,
i
think,
where
this
line
of
questioning
began
is
that
the
invocation
facts
which
have
to
be
proven
by
the
claimant
and
the
rebuttal
facts
which
we
are
required
to
prove
create
an
essential
mismatch,
and
since
there
is
no
bursting
bubble,
once
we
get
past
the
invocation
phase
and
this
logical
and
orderly
consideration
of
the
facts
which
need
to
be
proven
in
a
burden-shifting
presumption,
that
we
reach
the
point
where
the
evidence
makes
sense,
or
the
consideration
of
the
evidence
makes
sense.
the
preponderance
standard
for
consideration
of
invocation
evidence
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
government
is
the
traditional
rule
for
application
in
a
burden-shifting
presumption.
it
is
logical
and
it
is
fair.
it
has
worked
well
for
many
years
and
there
has
been
no
reason
to
change
it.
indeed,
we
think
the
fourth
circuit
had
no
reason
to
change
it.
congress
has
had
the
opportunity
to
look
at
it
twice,
and
has
found
no
reason
to
comment
on
the
agency's
approach.
the
rule
simply
gives
all
parties
their
day
in
court
on
the
whole
case,
not
just
a
part
of
it.
it
does
not
deny
benefits
to
deserving
claimants.
it
simply
requires
valid
proof
of
a
single
fact.
we
think
that
the
preferable
methodology
for
the
resolution
of
the
questions
that
are
presented
here
is
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
say
that
because
it
is
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
that
congress
has
spoken
on
the
issue
that
is
presented
in
this
case.
i
also
say
that
because
we
have
had
a
terrible
problem
in
this
program
with
uncertainty
in
the
rules
and
standards
of
proof
that
have
applied...
that
have
been
applied.
there
are
virtually
no
two
circuits
that
agree
on
anything
in
the
application
of
either
the
rebuttal
or
invocation
provisions
of
this
presumption
or
the
standards
of
proof
that
apply.
we
think
that
this
is
an
appropriate
place
for
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
come
in,
and
indeed
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
apply.
looking
specifically
at
the
invocation
provisions,
in
steadman
versus
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
this
court
held
after
a
comprehensive
review
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
apa
that
the
proponent
of
a
sanction
is
required
to
prove
the
facts
necessary
to
support
it
by
substantial,
that
is,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
evidence
pro
and
con,
similarly,
evidence
which
is
relevant
to
other
evidence
of
the
same
sort
must
be
weighed.
so
says
the
legislative
history.
steadman
also
holds
that
where
the
quantum
of
proof
required
to
prove
a
fact
is
not
specified
in
the
underlying
statutes,
that
is
where
the
administrative
procedure
act
steps
in
in
a
program
in
which
it
is
applicable
to
supply
the
preponderance
standard.
this
holding
in
steadman
with
no
great
leap
of
logic
reasonably
and
naturally
extends
to
invocation
of
a
burden-shifting
presumption
like
the
interim
presumption.
invocation
and
rebuttal
under
the
interim
presumption
are
separate
and
distinct
fact
inquiries.
some
party
bears
some
burden
by
some
quantity
of
evidence
to
prove
invocation
of
this
presumption,
but
it
is
not
specified
in
the
statute.
what
the
statute
does
specify
is
that
the
apa
applies,
and
we
think,
as
in
steadman,
that
the
apa
supplies
the
preponderance
rule
for
invocation
as
well
as
for
rebuttal
of
this
presumption.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
well,
the
reliance
placed
there
is
on
section
422
(a)
of
the
black
lung
act.
section
422
(a)
authorized
the
secretary
to
write
regulations
which
deviate
from
the
longshore
act.
i
do
not
think
that
the
secretary's
claim...
and
it
has
been
rejected
by
every
circuit,
and
it
has
been
rejected
by
congress.
when
they
really
need
an
exemption
from
the
apa
in
the
black
lung
program
they
have
gone
to
congress
to
get
it.
and
so
obviously
i
wonder
how
strongly
they
believe
that
in
fact
section
422
(a)
provides
them
with
the
exemption
that
they
request.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
it
says
the
longshore
act
applies
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
regulations
of
the
secretary.
i
don't
know
that
that
necessarily
would
give
the
secretary
the
carte
blanche
to
pick
and
choose
from
among
the
apa
rules
that
he
would
like
to
apply
and
those
which
he
would
not
like
to
apply.
looking
at
the
decisions
of
this
court,
i
think
that
that
claim
for
supersedure
would
go
far
beyond
any
holding
that
this
court
or,
for
that
matter,
the
circuits
have
ever
reached.
it
is
just
too
broad.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
e.
solomons
although
it
is
not
terribly
relevant
to
the
case,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
one

overwhelming

in
order
to
generate
evidence
you
have
to
produce
the
claimant.
the
claimant
simply
does
not
have
to
come
and
take
as
many
examinations
or
chest
x-rays
or
tests
as
we
want
him
to.
the
claimant
is
not
required
to
do
that,
and
the
administrative
law
judges
can
certainly
protect
them
from
that,
and
they
do.

yes,
that's
right.

the
claimant
can
do
the

thing,

the

will
pay
for

if
the
claimant
wins,
then
we
pay
for
it.

i
think
the
critical
question
lies
in
connection
with
the
rest
of
what
it
says.
for
example,
the
reference
to
an
x-ray
is
not
an
inaccurate
reference
if
that
x-ray
is
the
most
credible
and
reliable
piece
of
evidence
or
x-ray
evidence
in
the
record.
that
certainly
can
establish
if
the
claimant
