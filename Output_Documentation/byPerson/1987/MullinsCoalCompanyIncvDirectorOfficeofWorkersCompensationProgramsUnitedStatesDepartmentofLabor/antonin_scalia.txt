justice
scalia
it
is
not
a
total
mismatch,
at
least
as
to
(a)
1.
it
seems
to
me
you
would
be
able
to
rebut
the
(a)
1--
justice
scalia
--the
evidence
for
the
(a)
1
presumption.
justice
scalia
well,
i
thought
that
the
rule...
maybe
you
are
arguing
from
a
different
rule,
for
a
different
rule
than
the
government,
but
i
thought
that
the
only
evidence
you
were
going
to
allow
to
come
in
under
(a)
is
evidence
of
the
same
sort,
but
you
want
all
evidence.
justice
scalia
well,
if
you
only
allow
evidence
of
the
same
sort
to
come
in,
then
you
still
face
to
some
degree--
justice
scalia
you
were
making
the
point
that
we
had
to
adopt
the
position
you
were
urging
because
otherwise
you
would
have
an
opportunity
to
rebut
the
data
under
subsection
(a).
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
even
if
we
adopt
the
position
that
you
excuse,
which
is
essentially
the
position
that
the
government
takes
following
the
agency's
interpretation
of
its
rule,
you
won't
necessarily
have
a
chance
to
rebut
all
the
evidence
that
is
brought
forward
under
(a).
for
example,
under
(a)2
the
presumption
is
established
if
ventilatory
studies
establish
the
presence
of
a
chronic
respiratory
or
pulmonary
disease.
as
i
understand
the
way
the
agency
applies
the
statute
it
will
allow
as
rebuttal
under
(a)
only
studies
of
the
same
sort,
so
only
ventilatory
studies
that
refute
the
presence
of
a
chronic
respiratory
or
pulmonary
disease
would
be
allowed
in.
not
an
autopsy,
for
example,
under
(a)2.
you
would
never
be
able
to
get
in
under
(b)
that
autopsy
which
shows
that
the
ventilatory
study
was
wrong,
the
way
i
understand
the
agency's
position.
how,
am
i
wrong
about
their
position?
if
i
am
right
about
their
position,
then
your
position
does
not
create
the
nice
logic
that
you
would
have
us
believe.
justice
scalia
okay,
but
then
you
are
bound
to
acknowledge
that
even
under
your
position
the
statute
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense,
that
there
is
some
evidence
that
you
are
never
going
to
be
able
to
use
to
refute
other
evidence,
right?
justice
scalia
under
your
rule
it
is
just
a
lesser
amount
of
contradictory
evidence
that
has
no
place,
but
you
will
have
to
admit
that
there
is
some
contradictory
evidence
that
will
have
no
place,
even
under
your
rule.
an
autopsy
that
shows
contrary
to
a
ventilatory
study,
that
there
is
no
respiratory
or
pulmonary
disease,
where
do
you
get
that
in
under
your
position?
justice
scalia
you
cannot
use
it
to
refute
a
ventilatory
study.
justice
scalia
anywhere,
neither
under
(a)
nor
(b).
justice
scalia
well,
why
is
that?
that
makes
no
sense.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
do
about
what
the
government
points
out
in
footnote
30
of
its
brief,
which
is
that
the
apa
is
excluded
in
cases
where
it
is
otherwise
provided
by
regulations
of
the
secretary?
justice
scalia
it
does
say
that,
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
regulations,
et
cetera.
justice
scalia
it
also
is
hard
to
say
it
more
accurately,
isn't
it?
if
you
use
the
plural,
the
implication
would
be
that
even
if
you
showed
it
by
a
preponderance,
that
preponderance
would
have
to
consist
of
more
than
one
chest
x-ray.
justice
scalia
now,
does
the
agency
interpret
the
plural
when
it
is
used
in
the
other
sections,
such
as
studies,
ventilatory
studies,
does
the
preponderance
there
have
to
be
a
preponderance
that
is
composed
of
more
than
one
study?
justice
scalia
that
is
very
unfortunate,
because
that
is
just
not
consistent
with
what
you
have
just
been
saying.
justice
scalia
but
that
being
one
category
of
respiratory
disease,
it
comes
to
the
same,
you
are
saying.
justice
scalia
does
the
presumption
that
is
established
in
(a)
amount
to
any
more
than
saying
that
a
tie
goes
to
the
claimant?
what
do
you
need
to
overcome
the
presumption,
any
more
than
a
showing
by
a
mere
preponderance
that
the
presumption
is
not
correct?
is
that
all
that
it
takes?
justice
scalia
just
answer
that
question.
you
have
gone
through
stage
(a).
the
presumption
has
been
established.
what
does
it
take
under
(b)
to
upset
it
in
your
view,
just
a
preponderance
of
all
of
the
medical
evidence?
justice
scalia
if
that
is
the
case
then,
isn't
this
all
a
tempest
in
a
teapot,
because
the
agency
is
saying
anyway
that
the
tie
goes
to
the
claimant.
what
is
the
name
of
the
rule
that--
--true
doubt.
the
true
doubt
rule.
so
what...
you
know,
what
is
all
this
about?
justice
scalia
which
amounts
to
saying
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
claimant
wins.
so
you
have
what
you
are
seeking
if
you
have
the
true
doubt
rule,
no
matter
how
you
come
out
on
this
quibble
between
(a)
and
(b).
justice
scalia
which
regulations
exclude
it?
justice
scalia
which
regulations
exclude
it?
justice
scalia
is
your
position
that
a
biopsy,
(a)1
means
just
a
single
biopsy,
what
about
(a)2?
does
ventilatory
studies
mean
more
than
one?
justice
scalia
i
thought
you
were
urging...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
foundation
of
your
argument
is
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
that
says
a
chest
roentgenogram
leaves
a,
simply
one,
you
are
saying,
but
(a)2
says
ventilatory
studies.
now,
if
you
are
going
to
be
literal,
ventilatory
studies
means
more
than
one.
