mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
under
the
regulations
at
issue
here,
a
miner
with
ten
or
more
years
of
coal
mine
experience
need
only
establish
one
of
four
basic
facts
in
order
to
create
a
presumption
of
compensable
disability.
for
example,
he
can
prove
the
existence
of
pneumoconiosis
by
virtue
of
certain
x-ray,
biopsy,
or
autopsy
evidence,
or
he
can
prove
a
disabling
pulmonary
impairment
by
virtue
of
certain
test
evidence.
once
he
establishes
the
basic
fact
in
question,
the
burden
then
shifts
to
the
mine
owner
or
the
director
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
compensable
disability.
the
regulations
only
permit
the
mine
owner
to
rebut
the
presumption
by
establishing
either
that
the
miner
is
not
disabled
or
that
he
does
not
suffer
from
pneumoconiosis
or
that
his
condition
is
not
caused
by
coal
mine
employment.
the
word
"establish"
in
the
rebuttal
provisions
has
been
universally
interpreted
at
the
director's
urging
to
mean
proved
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
question
presented
here
is
what
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
miner
at
the
initial
invocation
stage.
the
regulations
there
also
state
that
he
must
establish
the
basic
fact
in
question,
and
the
director
has
interpreted
the
word
"established"
there
to
mean
the
same
thing
it
means
in
the
rebuttal
portion
of
the
regulations.
that
is,
he
must
prove
the
fact
in
question
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
regulations
on
this
point
are
not
ambiguous,
but
what
i
hope
to
show
is
that
only
the
director's
interpretation
can
ultimately
be
squared
with
the
language
of
the
regulations.
i
would
like
to
deal
straightaway
with
what
appears
to
be
the
greatest
problem
for
the
director's
interpretation,
and
that
is
the
first
invocation
category,
which
permits
the
presumption
to
be
invoked
upon
proof
that
a
chest
x-ray,
biopsy
or
autopsy
establishes
the
existence
of
pneumoconiosis.
viewed
in
isolation,
the
singular
there,
the
reference
to
a
chest
x-ray
might
seem
to
support
the
court
of
appeals'
view
of
the
regulations.
in
fact,
seen
in
context,
the
language
strongly
supports
the
director's
interpretation.
the
language
of
that
invocation
category
is
taken
directly
verbatim
from
the
1972
regulations
of
the
social
security
administration
dealing
with
black
lung
claims
filed
prior
to
july
of
1973.
the
consistent
interpretation
of
that
exact
same
language
is
that
the
miner
must
prove
the
facts
in
question
by
a
preponderance
of
all
the
evidence
in
that
category.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
regulation
requires
that
the
claimant
establish
the
fact
in
question,
and
requires
that
he
establish
the
existence
of
pneumoconiosis,
and
that
suggests
a
process
of
weighing
the
evidence,
of
weighing
all
the
like
kind
evidence
and
evaluating
it.
the
regulation
may
be
inartfully
drafted
to
make
that
point,
but
with
six
years
of
consistent
interpretation
requiring
proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
the
reincorporation
of
precisely
the
same
language
in
the
new
regulations
should
have
the
same
effect
as
that
language
in
the
old
regulations.
the
reference
to
a
chest
x-ray--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
the
use
of
the
singular
makes
clear
that
a
chest
x-ray
may
be
sufficient
to
invoke
the
presumption,
but
not
that
it
must
be
in
the
face
of
countervailing
more
persuasive
evidence
of
the
same
kind.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no.
a
single
study
will
suffice
to
invoke
the
presumption
if--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
it
is
consistent
insofar
as
the
reference
to
studies
clearly
indicates
that
all
existing
studies
are
to
be
considered
and
weighed
in
the
process
of
determining
whether,
for
example,
under
category
(b)2
the
person
has
established
the
existence
of
a
pulmonary
impairment,
or
under
category
b(3)
whether
the
studies
have
demonstrated
a
respiratory
disease,
and
the
reference
there
clearly
indicates
that
there
is
to
be
a
weighing
process,
and
that
more
than
one
study
can
be
relevant,
but
it
has
been
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
director
that
a
single
study
will
suffice
in
the
absence
of
countervailing
studies
proving
the
contrary.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
would
apply
only
at
the
interim
presumption
stage.
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no,
not
at
the
rebuttal
stage.
at
the
rebuttal
stage
the
burden
is...
the
proof
is
already
on
the
mine
owner
to
rebut
the
presumption.
the
true
doubt
rule
only
comes
into
play
when
the
burden
is
on
the
miner
and
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise.
if
the
burden
is
on
the
min
owner--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
the
true
doubt
rule--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
true
doubt
rule
is
published
in
the
federal
register
accompanying
the
interim
regulations
in
a
discussion
of
the
rebuttal
provisions.
it
is
an
attempt
by
the
director
to
implement
congress's
intent
to
make
benefits
liberally
available,
to
recognize
that
there
are
certain
difficulties
in
proving
pneumoconiosis
through
medical
evidence,
and
congress
made
it
fairly
clear
that
they
wanted
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
be
given
to
the
miners,
and
the
true
doubt
rule
is
an
attempt
to
implement
that.
however,
i
would
stress
that
no
issues
are
foreclosed
by
that.
it
merely
allows
the
burden
to
shift
to
the
mine
owner
on
rebuttal,
and
all
issues
are
open
on
rebuttal.
justice
scalia
asked
earlier
how
the
rebuttal
mechanism
works,
whether
it,
for
example,
by
showing
the
ventilatory
studies
established
the
existence
of
impairment,
then
autopsy
evidence
would
be
admissible
on
rebuttal.
it
would
indeed
be
admissible
on
rebuttal
under
the
(b)4
category,
which
allows
the
mine
owner
to
prove
the
miner
does
not
have
pneumoconiosis.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
you
cannot
prove
that
by
virtue
of
the
same
sort
of
evidence.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
pneumoconiosis
and
a
respiratory
disease
are
not
one
and
the
same
thing,
and
they
are
kept
distinct
for
purposes
of
the
rebuttal
categories.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
would
depend
on
which
invocation
category
we
used.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
in
number,
2--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes.
they
can't.
they
cannot
offer
more
pulmonary
studies
to
show
that
he
doesn't.
in
other
words,
all
the
pulmonary
studies
will
have
had
to
have
been
considered
and
weighed
at
the
invocation
stage,
but
all
evidence
relevant
to
whether
the
person
has
a
pulmonary
impairment,
for
example,
the
opinions
of
a
doctor
who
has
examined
the
miner,
as
well
as
blood
gas
studies,
would
be
admissible
to
show--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
because
the
(a)2
invocation
category
relies
on
specific
values.
the
tests
are
given
specific
values,
and
if
a
miner
meets
those
values
in
a
reliable
test,
then
the
category
is
invoked
provided
there
are
not
other
tests
of
the
same
sort
which
preclude
invocation
under
that
category.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
