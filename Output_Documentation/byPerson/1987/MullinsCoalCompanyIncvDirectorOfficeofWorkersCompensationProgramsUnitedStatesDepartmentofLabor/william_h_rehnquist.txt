justice
scalia
will
finish
his
question
at
1:00
o'clock.
when
we
rose,
mr.
solomons,
i
believe
justice
scalia
was
in
the
process
of
putting
a
question
to
you.
chief

h.

william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
solomons.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
three
cases,
and
the
first
of
this,
86-32,
mullins
coal
company
versus
the
director
of
the
office
of
workers'
compensation
programs,
we
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
regarding
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
invocation
stage
of
a
black
lung
benefits
claim.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
written
by
justice
stevens
for
the
court,
we
agree
with
the
secretary
of
labor
and
hold
that
a
single
item
of
qualifying
evidence
is
not
always
sufficient
to
invoke
the
presumption
rather
a
claimant
must
establish
at
least
one
of
the
five
qualifying
facts
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan
joined.
