and
then
the
secured
creditor
would
have
had
whatever
value
there
was
in
the
security
and
used
that
money
at
whatever
market
rates?
justice
white
at
least
there
was
an
understanding
on
reorganization.
justice
white
but
nevertheless,
if
a
secured
creditor
was
undersecured,
what
happened?
justice
white
mr.
cohn,
do
you
agree
with
your
opposition
as
to
the
status
of
the
secured
creditor
before
the
code
was
adopted?
did
the
undersecured
creditor
in
a
reorganization
ever
get
the
time
value
of
his
interest
in
the
property?
justice
white
i
know.
but
this
is
a
reorganization
case.
justice
white
for
which
you
made
the
motion.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
before
the
code,
would
your
client
have
been
entitled
to
recognition
of
the
time
value
of
his
interest
in
the
property?
justice
white
in
this
very
case,
in
a
case
exactly
like
this?
justice
white
there
wouldn't
have
been,
no,
because
there
was
no
provision
like
that.
justice
white
with
no
equity?
justice
white
it
didn't
have
to.
justice
white
in
a
reorganization?
justice
white
so
you
just
say
the
cases
that
he
cites
to
the
contrary,
he
just
mis-cites
them,
or
they
didn't
hold
that,
or
what?
justice
white
assume
we
come
to
the
conclusion,
erroneous,
i'm
sure
you
think,
that
the
secured
creditor,
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
code,
would
not
have
had
the
time
value
of
his
money
and
would
have
been
deprived
of
it.
do
you
think
that
nevertheless,
the
code,
the
way
it
is
worded,
should
give
him
something
that
he
wasn't
entitled
to
before?
justice
white
so
what
the
law
was
before
doesn't
govern
what
the
law
is
now?
