chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
number
86-1602,
united
savings
association
of
texas
versus
timbers
of
inwood
forest
associates,
inc.--
mr.
cohn,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
just
took
his
security
and
foreclosed
and
thumbed
his
nose
at
the
bankruptcy
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohn.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
simon.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
dramatic
change
has
been
the
automatic
stay,
really.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
had
a
fair
amount
of
experience
representing
creditors
in
bankruptcy
under
the
act
and
you
just
didn't
have
to
put
up
with
all
this
stuff.
you
could
take
your
security,
and
they
had
to
bring
a
plenary
action
against
you
in
district
court
in
order
to
even
question,
and
the
only
thing
there
was
to
defend
that
the
security
was
improper.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
my
private
practice
ceased
in
1969
so
that
perhaps
i
just
missed
the
bankruptcy
rules.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
united
savings
getting
any
interest
payments
during
the
bankruptcy?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
reason
it
is
not
getting
any
interest
is
because
of
the
bankruptcy
proceedings?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
and
of
course,
the
fifth
circuit
has
reversed
the
bankruptcy
court's
order
in
effect.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
the
fifth
circuit's
view
prevailed,
united
savings
will
continue
through
the
proceeding
without
receiving
any
interest
on
its
debt.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
question
i
asked
was
whether
united
states
was
receiving
interest,
and
you
have
answered
it
by
saying
no,
it
isn't
receiving
interest.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
case
may
be
an
egregious
example
of
extension,
because
of
litigation
of
important
issues,
as
you
suggest.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
under
the
rule
held
by
the
fifth
circuit,
secured
creditors
such
as
united
states
savings
would
not
get
interest
pending
the
bankruptcy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
bankruptcy
law
has
always
distinguished
sharply
between
secured
creditors
and
undersecured
creditors,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing,
though,
that
this
bankruptcy
is
ultimately
dismissed.
is
united
states,
or
what
is
the
name
of
the
creditor?
chief
justice
rehnquist
united
savings,
entitled
to
get
accrued
interest
out
of
the
security
as
well
as
principal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
unless
you're
talking
about
how
much
it's
bid
in
at.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
they
still
would
have
been
out
six
months'
interest,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
they
would
have
been
out
the
interest
for
however
long
the
proceeding
was
in
bankruptcy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
simon,
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cohn,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohn.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-1602,
united
savings
association
of
texas
versus
timbers
of
inwood
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
