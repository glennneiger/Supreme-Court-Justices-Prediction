mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
just
like
to
briefly
respond
to
two
points
that
have
been
raised
by
petitioner.
first,
that
the
time
value
of
foreclosure
rights
is
protected
by
state
law
is
a
question
that
i
can't
answer.
but
it
is
a
question
that
the
federal
bankruptcy
code
has
answered.
the
federal
bankruptcy
code
in
section
502(b)(2)
and
in
section
506(a)
and
(b)
has
legislated
on
the
issue
of
interest.
this
court,
in
butner,
specifically
stated
that
in
cases
where
the
legislature
has
spoken
on
issues,
that
federal
law
will
override
the
state
law.
i
would
just
point
out
to
the
court
that
that
issue
has
been
decided
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
secondly,
both
(d)(1)
and
(d)(2)
were
part
of
a
law
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
it
is
simply
not
the
case
that
either
one
or
the
other
was
not
the
law.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
not
so,
because
there
was
an
automatic
stay
pursuant
to
1144,
in
prior
law.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
well,
i
beg
to
differ
with
the
court,
but
at
some
point
there
was
a
time
when
in
order
to
get
an
automatic
stay
effected,
a
debtor
had
to
take
affirmative
action
to
do
so.
once
it
was
effected,
however,
then
we
were
under
the
same
rules
that
we
are
under
right
now.
but,
for
more
than
ten
years
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
we
had
bankruptcy
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
those
rules
provided
for
an
automatic
stay
upon
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
case.
your
honor
may
be
referring
to
a
time
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
i
think
perhaps
that
may
be
the
case.
and
to
say
that--
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
--oh,
yes,
there
was.
very
clearly
so.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
oh,
the
case
law
is
very
clear
from
prior
tot
he
enactment
of
the
bankruptcy
code
under
a
steady
stream
of
cases
beginning
with
sexton
v.
dreyfus
and
ending
with
nicholas,
and
then
from
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
starting
with
in
re
murel,
third
avenue
transit,
followed
by
yale
express
and
bermec,
that
the
undersecured
creditor
was
entitled
to
protection
against
the
depreciation
in
the
physical
value
of
the
property,
not
for
lost
opportunity
costs.
that
was
the
law
and
has
been
the
law
for
a
century.
and
to
say
that
united,
the
petitioner
herein,
was
following
the
law
at
the
time
or
the
practice
at
the
time
and
only
proceeding
under
(d)(1)
is
in
my
mind
an
incredible
argument.
it
was
surprising
to
me
that
they
did
not
proceed
under
(d)(2).
if
they
had
proceeded
under
(d)(2)
they
might
have
won.
but
they
did
not.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
go
into
my
argument
if
i
may.
this
is
clearly
a
statutory
construction
case.
this
court
has
had
many
occasions
to
construe
congressional
enactments.
we
have
reviewed
many
of
the
cases
that
have
talked
about
the
procedure
that
the
court
follows.
ernst
&
ernst
v.
hochfelder,
touche
ross
v.
reddington,
and
many
others,
including
the
midlantic
bank
v.
new
jersey,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions,
very
well-written
opinions
on
both
sides.
what
we
glean,
although
this
is
not
an
area
that
is
very
clear,
what
we
glean
from
all
of
these
cases
is
that
the
court
goes
through
the
following
analysis.
first,
it
looks
to
the
actual
words
of
the
statute
to
see
if
the
intent
of
congress
is
clear
from
the
face
of
the
statute...
that
is,
the
plain
meaning
rule...
and,
whether
such
interpretation
is
harmonious
with
the
entire
statutory
scheme.
second,
the
analysis
goes
through
the
congressional
policy
of
the
underlying
statute
to
see
if
the
proper
interpretation
is
consistent
with
the
congressional
policy
underlying
the
statute.
third,
if,
only
if
the
intent
of
congress
cannot
be
gleaned
from
the
first
two
elements,
then
the
court
will
go
into
the
legislative
history.
and
as
this
court
has
been
divided
at
times
on
the
types
of
legislative
history
used
or
whether
legislative
history
is
appropriate
to
use,
beginning
in
1950
with
a
stream
of
cases,
from
that
point,
this
court
has
been
more
willing
to
look
at
legislative
history
because
of
the
availability
of
the
legislative
history
to
both
sides.
prior
to
1950,
the
big
argument
was,
it
is
not
available
and
it
wasn't
very
clear.
today,
i
am
going
to
emphasize
the
first
two
elements
of
the
analysis
because
it
is
my
belief
that
nothing
substantial
can
be
added
to
judge
randall's
scholarly
treatment
and
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
behind
the
bankruptcy
code
contained
in
the
timbers
panel
opinion.
also,
i
would
like
to
commend
to
the
court,
for
the
arguments
which
i
do
not
have
time
today
to
make,
the
well
written
briefs
of
amici
global
marine
and
national
association
of
credit
managers.
there
are
two
phrases
and
one
word
which
has
been
used
to
attempt
to
import
into
section
361
this
time
value
analysis.
they
are
"indubitable
equivalent",
"interest
in
property",
and
"value".
petitioner
argues
that
the
phrase
361(3)
imports
a
time
value
analysis
into
section
361.
petitioner
cites
for
authority
case
v.
los
angeles
lumber
products
company,
308
u.s.
at
115
where
the
court
stated
that
where
words
are
employed
in
an
act
which
had
at
the
time
a
well-known
meaning
in
the
law,
they
are
used
in
that
sense
unless
the
context
requires
otherwise.
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
focus
on
that
last
phrase,
"unless
the
context
requires"
to
the
contrary.
the
arguments
against
importing
the
time
value
analysis
into
361
through
this
term
or
phrase
"indubitable
equivalent"
are
fivefold.
first,
the
words
are
used
in
a
different
context
in
section
361.
"indubitable
equivalent"
was
used
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
bankruptcy
code
in
the
confirmation
context,
if
in
fact
they
were
terms
of
art.
secondly,
the
phrase
1978
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
become
a
term
of
art
with
a
well-defined
meaning.
congress
took
the
phrase
from
in
re
murel
holding
corporation,
75
fed.
2d
941,
a
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
in
1935,
where
judge
hand
specifically
used
it
in
the
confirmation
context,
and
in
43
years
between
the
date
of
morel
and
the
enactment
of
the
code,
the
term
or
phrase
"indubitable
equivalent"
was
only
used
nine
times.
those
opinions
did
nothing
to
define
19.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
no,
clearly
not.
very
clearly
not,
for
two
reasons.
first,
and
this
is
the...
i
was
just
about
to
get
into
this.
first,
the
opinion
of
judge
hand
in
murel
was
by
its
own
terms
limited
to
the
confirmation
context.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
it
was
not.
in
re
murel,
time
value
was
referred
to
in
in
re
murel
by
judge
hand
as
quote
"completely
compensatory".
"completely
compensatory".
that
was
the
phrase
that
judge
hand
used
in
in
re
murel
to
talk
about
the
time
value
of
money.
what
"indubitable
equivalent"
was
referring
to
in
that
case,
if
the
court
will
review
that
case
very
carefully,
it
is
a
very
well-written
case,
a
very
knowledgeable
man
wrote
that
case,
because
he
understood
bankruptcy.
he
understood
it
very
clearly.
what
he
was
talking
about
was
the
fact
that
there
was
no
principal
repayment
until
the
end
of
the
ten-year
term.
the
plan
specifically
provided
for
the
time
value
of
money.
it
provided
for
market
interest
rate
on
the
principal.
and
the
judge
said
it
is
completely
compensatory,
it
has
to
be
completely
compensatory.
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
that
interest
is
the
equalizing
factor.
what
he
was
really
referring
to,
i
think,
was
feasibility.
with
"indubitable
equivalent",
what
he
was
really
referring
to
was
the
repayment
of
the
principal
and
the
fact
that
there
was
no
principal
repayment
during
the
ten
years
of
the
plan,
and
that
it
was
an
interest-only
obligation,
and
that
there
was
big
balloon
payment
ten
years
down
the
line.
nobody
knew
whether
the
property
was
going
to
have
sufficient
value
to
pay
that
balloon
payment.
there
was
no
amortization.
yet
another
possibility,
he
was
referring
to
the
fairness
of
forcing
a
creditor
to
wait
for
ten
years
to
receive
any
interest.
but
very,
very
clear,
and
this
is
a
point
which
one
needs
to
really
review
that
case
very
carefully
to
understand,
the
time
value
of
money
was
equated
to
the
term
"completely
compensatory".
"indubitable
equivalent"
referred
to
something
completely
different.
the
importation
of
the
time
value
analysis
into
section
361
through
"indubitable
equivalent"
is
yet
defended
again
by
judge
hand's
opinion
in
which
he
stated
that
no
doubt
less
would
be
required
during
the
interim
until
a
plan
could
be
filed
and
confirmed
by
the
court.
it
very
clearly
distinguished
that.
and
finally,
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
sections
361,
1129(b)(2)(a)
are
similar
in
that
each
have
two
specific
examples
filed
by
general
description,
all
in
the
disjunctive.
one
of
the
two
examples
in
1129(b)(2)(a)
specifically
provides
for
a
time
value
element,
in
other
words,
the
confirmation
cram-down
standard.
there
is
a
specific
time
value
element
in
that
statute,
in
that
part
of
the
statute
that
is
not
tied
to
"indubitable
equivalent".
neither
of
the
two
examples
in
361
specifically
provide
for
a
time
value
element.
each
section
of
the
bankruptcy
code
containing
a
specific
time
value
element
does
so
without
utilizing
the
words
"indubitable
equivalent".
section
1129(a)(7)(a)(ii),
section
1129(a)(9)(b),
section
1129(b)(2)(a),
section
1225(a)(4),
section
1225(b)(1)(a)
and
section
1325(b)(1)(a)
are
the
sections
in
the
bankruptcy
code
that
utilize
a
time
value
element,
and
none
of
them
used
the
words
"indubitable
equivalent".
thus,
when
congress
utilized
a
time
value
concept,
it
did
so
explicitly
and
it
did
so
without
utilizing
the
phrase
"indubitable
equivalent".
justice
blackmun,
speaking
for
the
court,
in
roussileau
v.
united
states,
464
united
states
at
23,
quoted
with
approval
the
following
elements
of
statutory
construction
from
the
1972
fifth
circuit
opinion
in
united
states
v.
won
kim
bo,
and
i
quote:
"where
congress
includes
particular
language
in
one
section
of
a
statute
but
omits
it
in
another
section
of
the
same
act,
it
is
generally
presumed
that
congress
acts
intentionally
and
purposefully
in
the
disparate
inclusion
and
exclusion.
"
thus,
if
the
phrase
is
not
a
term
of
art,
and
does
not
have
a
unique
time
value
element,
what
is
its
meaning?
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
"indubitable
equivalent"?
the
answer
is
that
the
phrase
must
mean,
quote:
"without
a
doubt,
an
acceptable
or
equal
substitute.
"
that's
what
the
phrase
means.
and
so
now
let's
apply
it
in
section
361(3).
it
would
mean,
other
adequate
protection
that
would
be,
without
a
doubt,
an
acceptable
or
equal
substitute
for
the
examples
of
adequate
protection
described
in
sections
361(1)
and
361(2).
and
in
section
1129(b)(2)(a)(iii),
the
phrase
would
mean,
other
fair
and
equitable
treatment
that
would
be,
without
a
doubt,
an
acceptable
or
equal
substitute
for
the
examples
of
fair
and
equitable
treatment
described
in
sections
1129(b)(2)(a)(i)
and
1129(b)(2)(a)(ii).
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
united
savings
is
not
getting
any
interest,
per
se.
it
is
receiving
the
net
operating
income
from
the
property.
it
is
not
designated
as
interest.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
the
reason
why
it
is
not
getting
any
interest
at
this
time
is
because
of
the
stays
that
have
been
entered
on
the
district
court
level
and
then
on
the
fifth
circuit
court
level,
staying
the
effect
of
the
bankruptcy
court's
order.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
yes,
that's
correct,
and
so
a
stay
is
no
longer
necessary.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
no
question
about
that.
i
would
like
to
make
this
point
about
that,
and
i
was
hoping
that
the
court
would
raise
that.
there
is
an
answer
to
that
question
in
the
continental
decision,
and
i
would
like
to
just
refer
this
to
the
court,
if
i
might.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
it
is
not
receiving
interest.
i
would
just
like
though
to
refer
this
to
the
court.
i
understand
that
this
proceeding
has
taken
quite
a
long
time,
and
i
understand
that
united
has
not
been
receiving
interest
for
a
long
time,
and
i
understand
that
a
plan
of
reorganization
has
not
been
filed
or
confirmed.
but
that
is
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
the
issues
that
are
determined
by
the
court
today
have
to
be
decided
before
something
can
be
done.
and
in
the
continental
case,
which
is,
the
full
cite
of
the
case
is
continental
illinois
national
bank
and
trust
company
v.
chase,
at
296
u.s.
648,
the
court
held
that
if
this
long
delay
were
without
adequate
excuse,
the
retention
of
the
injunction
for
the
long
period
which
has
intervened
since
it
was
granted
could
not
be
justified,
but
the
delay
is
obviously
due
to
the
many
doubts
and
uncertainties
arising
from
the
present
litigation.
with
those
doubts
and
uncertainties
now
removed,
the
proceedings
should
go
forward
to
completion
without
further
delay.
and
that
will
occur.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
correct.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
correct.
the
proper
remedy
for
the
creditor
in
that
particular
instance,
if
the
debtor
cannot
file
a
plan
of
reorganization,
in
the
appropriate
period
of
time,
the
proper
remedy
is
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
working.
this
court
needs
to
know
that
it
is
working
very
well.
the
bankruptcy
judges
are
beginning
to
follow
1112
more
carefully.
they
are
giving
greater
consideration
to
extending
the
exclusive
period,
and
refusing
to
do
so,
and
they
are
administering
their
cases
and
moving
their
cases
forward.
that
is
the
proper
remedy
for
these
creditors.
that
is
what,
in
the
en
banc
decision,
judge
randall
said
that
the
bankruptcy
court
should
do,
and
it
is
incredible,
but
that
is
exactly
what
they
are
doing.
and
i
don't
know
any
good
debtor/bankruptcy
lawyer
today
who
is
not
filing
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
and
immediately
thereafter
pursuing
a
plan
of
reorganization
with
the
idea
of
filing
it
within
the
exclusive
period,
within
four
months,
because
the
bankruptcy
courts
will
not
allow
a
debtor
to
stay
in
bankruptcy
indefinitely,
any
longer.
and
it
is
because
of
the
fifth
circuit.
and
that
is
the
way
that
the
code
was
structured,
and
that
is
the
way
it
should
work,
and,
by
god,
that
is
the
way
it
is
working
now,
because
judge
randall
has
basically
cleared
it
up
with
the
fifth
circuit.
the
phrase
"interest
in
property".
the
phrase
361,
when
read
in
the
context
of
sections
362
through
364,
clearly
refers
to
the
various
types
of
ownership
interest
or
lien
interest
for
which
a
party
may
require
adequate
protection.
for
example,
an
entity
may
have
an
ownership
interest
as
a
tenant-in-common,
a
joint
tenant
or
a
tenant
by
the
entireties.
an
entity
may
be,
along
with
a
debtor,
a
beneficiary
in
a
trust
or
the
holder
of
a
deed
of
trust
covering
real
or
personal
property
to
secure
a
jointly
held
note
receivable.
an
entity
may
be
the
holder
of
a
pledge.
and
the
list
goes
on.
while
congress
used
"interest
in
property"
to
describe
many
different
property
rights,
the
phrase
refers
neither
to
enforcement
powers
or
remedies
to
realize
the
benefit
of
the
"interest
in
property",
nor
to
creditors'
rights
for
remedies.
congress'
use
of
the
general
and
broad
term
"interest
in
property"
therefore
should
not
be
read
to
require
protection
of
state
law
contractual
remedies
that
are
not
property
rights,
such
as
the
ability
to
foreclose.
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
at
this
juncture.
that
is,
justice
scalia,
you
were
absolutely
correct.
oversecured
creditors
would
be
entitled
to
not
only
receive
their
lost
opportunity
costs
but
also
to
receive
their
interest
in
addition
to
that.
furthermore,
it
is
true
that
if
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion,
that
if
the
market
rate
is
higher
than
the
contract
rate,
then
they
would
be
getting
a
benefit
over
an
oversecured
creditor.
under
section
506(b)
it
is
very
clearly
inconsistent.
but
what
is
even
worse
than
that
is
that
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
why
undersecured
creditors
would
not
be
entitled
to
lost
opportunity
costs,
for,
were
it
not
for
the
imposition
of
the
automatic
stay,
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
go
to
judgment,
they
would
have
had
a
judgment
lien
on
their
property,
and
they
would
have
had
a
right-in-property,
a
foreclosure
right,
that
would
have
had
measurable
value.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
in
certain
circumstances,
yes,
but
the
bankruptcy
code
has
never
distinguished
secured
creditors
and
undersecured
creditors
based
on
the
ability
to
receive
lost
opportunity
costs.
never.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
united
savings.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
at
that
time,
it
becomes
moot,
because
it
has
the
security,
it
has
the
collateral.
it
will
have
already
foreclosed,
and
so
it
becomes
a
moot
point
at
that
time.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
the
amount
that
it
will
bid
in
will
not
be
affected
by
this
case
or
by
our
interpretation
of
section
361.
it
will
bid
in
the
amount
of
its
note
or,
under
texas
law,
probably
70
to
80
percent
of
the
amount
of
the
indebtedness,
at
that
time.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
there
is
no
question
that
it
would
be
out
that
interest.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
there's
no
question
about
this.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
this
is
a
very
unusual
case.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
this
is
a
very
unusual
case,
because
it
has
taken
so
long.
it
should
not
have
taken
so
long.
within
six
months
after
the
filing
of
this
bankruptcy
proceeding,
had
it
not
been
for
this
counsel's
use
of
only
section
362(d)(1),
and
the
imposition
of
the
stays
and
the
reluctance
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
do
anything
pending
the
fifth
circuit's
determination,
this
case
would
have
been
determined
years
ago.
mr.

questionable.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
that
assumes
they
would
have
taken
the
property
into
their
reo
department
and
immediately
sold
it,
which
may
or
may
not
be
the
case.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
lower
court
to
that
effect.
and
in
fact,
this
court
may
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
many
lenders
retain
properties
in
the
hopes
that
they
will
increase
in
value
over
the
years
and
then
sell
them
two
and
three
years
dow
the
line.
so
it
is
not
an
absolute,
foregone
conclusion
that
they
would
have
been
able
to
obtain
interest.
that
issue
has
been
decided
by
this
court
many,
many
times.
the
undersecured
creditor
is
not
entitled
to
interest
under
sexton,
nicholas
and
many
more
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court,
that
the
bankruptcy
code
and
the
power
of
congress
to
legislate
bankruptcy
laws
basically
gives
the
right
to
congress
to
stay
the
enforcement
of
lien
rights.
the
court
has
continuously
said
that
only
the
value
of
the
property
is
protected
against
decline,
not
the
loss
of
interest
during
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
that
has
been
very
clear
precedent.
i
am
going
to
go
into
the
next
portion
of
my
argument
here
very
quickly.
the
language
of
section
502(b)(2)
is
clear
that
a
claim
for
unmatured
interest
as
of
the
date
of
bankruptcy
is
disallowed.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
interest
cannot
accrue,
under
section
502(b)(2).
the
word
502(b)(2)
is
defined
in
section
101(4)(a)
to
include
a
secured
or
an
unsecured
claim.
section
506(a)
defines
the
secured
claim
as
being
equal
to
the
value
of
the
creditor's
interest
and
the
estate's
interest
in
the
collateral.
the
question
that
i
would
pose
to
this
court
is
how
could
the
estate's
interest
in
collateral
include
foreclosure
rights
of
a
third
party?
if
united's
interest
in
the
collateral
is
limited
to
the
estate's
interest
in
the
collateral,
how
could
it
possibly
include
lost
opportunity
costs
of
a
third
party?
that
is
one
of
the
clearest
deficiencies
in
that
argument.
there
are
only
two
exceptions
to
502(b)(2)
and
that
is
506(b)
which
allows
interest
in
the
case
where
the
collateral
is
in
excess
of
the
value
of
the
debt
and
also
726(a)(5)
which
provides
that
if
the
liquidation
estate
has
enough
assets
to
pay
its
allowed
priority
secured
and
unsecured
claims,
then
it
can
also
pay
interest.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
no.
judge
clark,
i
believe
you
are
talking
about
the
concurring
decision
in
the
en
banc?
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
i
don't
believe
that
the
concurring
opinion
adopted
the
idea
that
in
some
cases
it
was
allowable
and
in
some
cases
it
was
not.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
i
don't
think
that
was
the
case
that--
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
--right.
the
majority
opinion
in
the
tim
case
clearly
adopts
that
approach.
there
is
a
case,
called
briggs
transportation,
and
that
is
the
case,
and
i
believe
that
briggs
transportation
is
out
of
the
eighth
circuit,
that
was
decided
after
american
mariner,
which
basically
says
that
yes,
sometimes
it
is
allowable
and
sometimes
it
is
not.
the
problem
with
that
case
is
that
this
is
clearly
a
statutory
construction
case.
i
don't
have
time
to
go
into
all
of
that,
but
it
is
clearly
a
statutory
construction
case,
and
it
is
either
permitted
or
it
is
not
permitted.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
i
am
not
certain
that
chief
judge
clark,
in
his...
i
would
have
to
read
that
concurring
opinion
again.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
judge
clark
was
adopting
the
briggs
transportation
ruling,
that
in
some
cases
it
would
be
and
in
some
cases
it
would
not.
i'd
have
to
read
that
again,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
what
judge
clark
was
saying.
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
finally,
i
would
like
to
point
out
two
things
out
of
the
legislative
history
that
are
amusing,
if
not
interesting.
there
were
two
amicus
briefs
filed
in
this
case,
one
by
the
national
commercial
finance
conference.
in
the
legislative
proceedings
that
preceded
the
enactment
of
the
code,
the
party
speaking
for
national
commercial
finance
conference,
during
those
committee
hearings,
stated
that
the
secured
creditor
should
receive
periodic
payments
during
the
pendency
of
the
stay
to
cover
depreciation
of
property
or
wear
and
tear.
it
is
very
interesting
that
they
are
now
adopting
a
different
approach,
when
in
the
committee
hearings
they
clearly
adopted
the
approach
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
fifth
circuit.
secondly,
the
other
amicus
that
has
filed
in
this
case,
american
bankers
association,
also
stated
that
the
automatic
stay
should
remain
in
effect
if
it
is
clear
that
the
value
of
the
secured
creditor's
claim
against
the
collateral
will
be
preserved,
and
further
said
that
the
suggested
standards
set
forth
in
the
commission's
notes
should
be
included
in
the
statute.
and
the
commission's
notes
basically
said
that
conditions
which
may
be
imposed
by
the
court
when
appropriate
include,
one,
requiring
other
security
of
an
equivalent
or
two,
if
there
is
no
equity,
or
the
equity
is
marginal,
requiring
additional
security
to
the
extent
of
the
anticipated
decrease
in
the
value
of
collateral
as
a
result
of
its
use.
i
find
that
very
interesting,
that
they
are
now
jumping
on
the
bandwagon
and
taking
the
position
that
this
is
what
the
law
was
at
the
time
that
the
code
was
enacted.
i
would
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
was
only
one
comment
in
all
of
the
legislative
history
that
ended
up
with
the
bankruptcy
code,
that
even
talked
about
this
issue,
and
it
was
a
part
of
a
law
journal
article
from
mr.
murphy.
the
law
journal
article
was
63
california
law
review
1483,
and
the
cite
was,
if
the
interim--
mr.
leonarad
h.
simon
--thank
you.
