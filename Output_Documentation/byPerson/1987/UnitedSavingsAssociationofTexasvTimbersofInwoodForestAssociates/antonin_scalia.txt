how
long
can
that
cost
continue
to
be
extracted
from
the
creditor?
i
mean,
under
(d)(2)
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
time
in
which
this
thing
has
to
be
brought
to
an
end
or
else
it
is
not
considered
an
effective
reorganization.
isn't
that
true?
justice
scalia
i'm
sure
nothing
specific.
but
it
can't
be
considered
an
effective
reorganization
if
it
drags
on
interminably,
can
it?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
it
can
go
on
for
two
years?
justice
scalia
should
they?
justice
scalia
the
only
point
i
am
making
is
that
there
is
some
outside
limit
that
is
introduced
elsewhere
in
the
code
upon
how
long
the
creditor
has
to
eat
the
interest,
in
effect.
justice
scalia
so
the
other
track
disappears
and
you
get
12.5
percent.
justice
scalia
favoring
you
over
the
oversecured
creditor,
which
is
justice
stevens'
point.
justice
scalia
well,
the
code,
as
opposed
to
the
act,
has
disadvantaged
the
secured
creditor
in
one
degree,
anyway.
and
we
are
just
arguing
over
whether
it
has
disadvantaged
him
further
still.
previously,
he
didn't
have
to
worry
about
some
judge
assuring,
in
the
judge's
estimation,
that
he
wasn't
being
prejudiced
by
the
delay.
now,
he
does,
under
the
code.
before,
he
could
take
his
property
and
go.
justice
scalia
oh,
but
it
is
a
disadvantage
not
to
be
able
to
take
your
property
and
leave.
even
if
they
can
get
the
judge
to
figure
out
that
you're
not
being
prejudiced,
you
don't
consider
that
a
disadvantage?
justice
scalia
having
your
property
is
quite
different
from
having
some
judge's
estimation
that
you
have
gotten
something
as
good
as
your
property,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
my
point
is
that
we
all
agree
that
the
secured
creditor
is
being
disadvantaged
by
the
code
and
the
question
is,
in
addition
to
disadvantaging
him
to
this
degree,
did
the
congress,
moreover,
want
to
deprive
him
of
the
ability
to
make
use
of
the
time
value
of
his
money?
justice
scalia
mr.
cohn,
can
i
ask
you
about
some
of
the
structural
problems
with
the
other
portions
of
the
statute
that
the
interpretation
you
are
putting
on
this
creates?
justice
scalia
subsection
362(b)
provides
for...
you
are
moving
under
(d)(1).
justice
scalia
which
says
the
automatic
stay
can
be
terminated
for
cause,
including
the
lack
of
adequate
protection
of
an
interest
in
property.
now,
you
are
saying
that
there
is
automatically
inadequate
protection
when
a
less
than
fully
secured
creditor
is
not
given
the
time
value
of
his
money,
in
effect,
right?
justice
scalia
nonetheless,
you
are
saying
that
that
comes
to
the
same
thing.
there
is
lack
of
adequate
protection
unless
you
are
assured,
unless
the
stay
is
modified
to
give
you
the
time
value
of
the
money.
if
that
is
the
case,
then
why
isn't
(d)(2)
entirely
superfluous?
that
is,
with
respect
to
a
stay
of
an
act
against
property
under
subsection
(a),
you
can
move
for
modification
if
two
conditions.
number
one,
the
debtor
does
not
have
an
equity
in
such
property...
but
that
is
always
going
to
be
the
case
when
you
have
an
undersecured
creditor...
and,
two,
you
need
a
second
condition
under
(d)(2)...
such
property
is
not
necessary
for
an
effective
reorganization.
you
wouldn't
need
that
second
condition
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
because
the
first
condition,
the
first
part
of
(d)(2)
would
be
the
same
as
(d)(1),
and
you
wouldn't
need
a
second
part
to
(d)(2).
justice
scalia
well,
(d)(1)
isn't
written
just
for
this.
but
(d)(2)
is
written
just
for
this.
justice
scalia
give
me
an
example,
specifically.
justice
scalia
no,
i
want
the
opposite.
i
want
when
you
would
be
entitled
to
relief
under
(d)(2)
that
you
couldn't
get
under
(d)(1).
justice
scalia
a
case
where
you
would
be
entitled
to
relief
under
(d)(2),
you
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
relief
under
(d)(1)
anyway.
justice
scalia
isn't
that
the
way
hand
used
it?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
ask
whether
it
was
limited
to
the
confirmation
process.
i
asked
whether
in
that
context
or
in
any
context,
it
wasn't
specifically
directed
to
time
value.
justice
scalia
it
was
not?
justice
scalia
it
will
be
a
moot
point.
the
fact
is,
it
will
be
out
the
interest,
during
that
whole
period,
right?
justice
scalia
you
may
consider
it
moot.
justice
scalia
the
good
people
at
united
savings
won't.
justice
scalia
pardon?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
before
us
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner
is
an
undersecured
creditor
of
the
respondent
who
is
a
debtor
undergoing
reorganization
in
bankruptcy.
section
362(d)(1)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
an
automatic
stay
of
actions
against
the
debtor
or
property
of
the
state
which
among
other
things
prevents
a
secured
creditor
from
foreclosing
on
his
collateral.
the
code
provides
however
that
the
court
can
provide
relief
from
the
stay
when
there
is,
in
the
words
of
the
code,
"lack
of
adequate
protection"
for
the
secured
parties
property
interest.
petitioner
in
this
case
sought
relief
from
the
automatic
stay
under
this
provision
in
the
form
of
monthly
interest
payments
asserting
that
because
of
the
stay
he
could
not
foreclose
on
the
collateral
and
since
he
could
not
foreclose
on
the
collateral
he
was
deprived
of
the
interest
that
he
would
be
receiving
on
the
collateral.
in
the
opinion
announced
today,
we
affirm
the
fifth
circuit
and
hold
that
the
right
of
undersecured
creditor
to
adequate
protection
of
its
interest
in
property
under
362(d)(1)
does
not
entitle
it
to
compensation
for
the
delay
caused
by
the
automatic
stay
in
foreclosing
on
collateral.
as
is
more
fully
explained
in
the
opinion,
we
reach
this
conclusion
because
the
contrary
interpretation
is
inconsistent
with
other
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
that
define
the
rights
of
secured
creditors
in
bankruptcy.
our
decision
will
not
leave
undersecured
creditors
open
to
inordinate
and
extortionate
delay
in
bankruptcy.
since
under
one
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
code
362(d)(2)
an
undersecured
creditor
is
entitled
to
relief
from
the
automatic
stay
if
the
debtor
does
not
show
that
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
a
successful
reorganization
within
a
reasonable
time.
the
court's
opinion
is
unanimous.
