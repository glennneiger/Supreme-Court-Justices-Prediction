mr.
h.
miles
cohn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
united
savings
is
a
secured
creditor
of
timbers
of
inwood
forest
associates,
a
debtor
under
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
as
a
creditor,
united
savings
has
a
claim
against
this
debtor.
but
as
a
secured
creditor,
united
savings
has
much
more.
united
has
an
interest
in
property
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
specifically,
that
interest
is
a
first
lien
deed
of
trust,
or
real
property
mortgage,
on
property
owned
by
the
debtor,
that
property
being
an
apartment
project
located
in
houston,
texas.
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
that
mortgage
and
under
applicable
laws
of
the
state
of
texas,
united
savings
has
the
right
to
have
its
security
interest
foreclosed
at
such
time
as
the
debtor
may
default,
has
the
right
to
have
the
property
sold
at
a
foreclosure
sale
at
that
time,
and
then
to
take
the
proceeds
of
that
sale,
or
the
proceeds
of
its
subsequent
disposition
of
the
property,
and
apply
those
proceeds
to
its
debt,
to
take
that
money
in
effect
and
put
it
out
in
a
new
investment
and
to
begin
earning
interest
or
other
income
on
that
new
investment,
and
to
take
that
money
also
and
apply
it
to
the
payment
of
its
debt.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
yes.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
no,
your
honor.
this
action
was
originally
brought
under
362(d)(1)
only.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
well,
it
was
a
petition
for
relief
from
the
stay,
your
honor.
it
was
filed
under
362(d)(1),
rather
than
under
362(d)(2).
and
i
suppose
of
hindsight
were
foresight
and
we
were
starting
this
all
over
again,
we
might
have
done
it
differently.
but
at
this
time,
particularly
in
texas,
but
i
suspect
elsewhere
across
the
country,
the
practice
in
this
sort
of
case
was
to
focus
very
early
on
in
the
case
on
the
question
of
whether
the
secured
creditor's
interest
in
property
was
adequately
protected.
that
was
the
typical
practice,
and
therefore,
this
motion
was
filed
focusing
on
that
issue.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
no,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
the
debtor
does
not
have
equity
in
the
property.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
and
that
was
one
of
the
findings
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
i
think
it
is
important
in
fact
to
emphasize
what
those
findings
were.
bankruptcy
code
section
362(a)
imposes
an
automatic
stay
which
stops
the
exercise
of
rights
and
property
at
such
time
as
a
bankruptcy
case
is
commenced.
the
automatic
stay
imposes
a
very
real
cost
on
a
secured
creditor.
that
cost
is
measured
by
the
income
lost,
the
income
that
could
have
been
earned
had
the
creditor
been
allowed,
but
for
the
automatic
stay,
to
exercise
its
rights
and
property.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
no,
your
honor,
(d)(2)
does
not
set
forth
any
kind
of
specific
standard
or
time
limit.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
at
some
point
it
has
dragged
on
so
long
and
there
is
no
little
hope
of
any
kind
of
reorganization
that
the
bankruptcy
court
might
terminate
the
stay
on
other
grounds.
but
that
might
be
two
or
three
years,
it
might
be
many
months,
it
might
be
any
period
of
time
that
causes
injury
and
damage
to
the
secured
creditor.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
i
have
seen
cases
that
have,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
normally
not,
your
honor,
but
they
should,
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
focus,
in
answering
the
question
posed
by
this
case,
not
on
the
single
asset
case.
this
is
a
single
asset
case
in
which
to
some
extent
the
issues
are
blended
together,
but
the
same
issue
arises
in
multiple
asset
cases.
you
might
have
a
continental
airlines
in
which
a
secured
creditor
holding
a
lien
on
one
airplane
comes
in
and
says
the
stay
ought
to
be
terminated,
and
if
there
is
no
protection
for
the
interest
of
that
secured
creditor
in
the
sense
of
the
time
value
of
money,
it
is
very
difficult
for
that
creditor
to
come
in
and
argue
that
the
proceedings
have
dragged
on
too
long.
in
terms
of
a
very
complex
case,
the
proceedings
might
last
justifiably
a
very
long
period
of
time,
but
that
should
not
take
the
place
of
the
need
to
protect
the
individual
secured
creditors.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
i
hate
to
be
difficult,
but
i
think
the
answer
is
yes
and
no.
yes,
in
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
discretion
at
some
point
to
take
action
under
some
other
provisions,
but
no,
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
principal
basis
for
measuring
the
damage
done
to
the
secured
creditor
and
imposing
some
kind
of
protection
as
time
goes
on
other
than
adequate
protection
under
362(d)(1)
and
361.
yes,
at
some
point
the
court
may
conclude
that
this
case
has
dragged
on
too
long,
but
even
if
that
is
six
months
past
what
might
be
a
reasonable
limit,
the
secured
creditor
has
incurred
very
serious
costs.
the
seriousness
of
those
costs
i
think
is
well
illustrated
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
bankruptcy
court
found
that
but
for
the
automatic
stay,
united
savings
could
have
foreclosed
on
the
property
and
liquidated
its
collateral
within
six
months
of
the
filing
of
the
case,
that
united
could
have
earned
$4.25
million
by
selling
the
property,
and
could
have
reinvested
that
money
at
12
percent
interest
per
annum.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
well,
i
believe
the
oversecured
creditor
is
protected,
because...
and
this
is
one
of
the
confusing
things
about
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
we
have
never
argued
that
all
undersecured
creditors
are
entitled
to
periodic
cash
payments.
creditors,
secured
creditors
are
entitled
to
some
protection
for
the
costs
of
delay.
the
oversecured
creditor
is
protected
because
he
in
a
sense
has
equity
in
the
property
and
he
knows
that
when
he
gets
to
the
end
of
the
proceeding
there
is
value
to
cover
the
costs
of
delay.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
he
absolutely
does.
he
gets
it
at
a
different
point
in
time.
in
other
words,
interest
continues
to
accrue
on
his
debt.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
and
he
is
entitled
to
eventually--
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
--we
get
12
percent
but
not,
if
the
debtor
elects,
under
section
1142,
to
reinstate
the
debt
according
to
its
terms.
in
essence,
it
is
like
there
are
two
tracks
going
along.
the
secured
creditors
rights
might
be
measured
by
default,
in
which
case
he
gets
in
essence
the
money
he
could
have
earned
in
the
event
that
there
had
been
a
default
or
he
gets
what
would
have
happened
if
the
debtor
reinstates
and
lives
up
to
the
terms
of
the
contract.
the
debtor
has
that
election.
the
debtor
doesn't
have
to
pay
12
percent
interest.
the
debtor
can
live
up
to
the
terms
of
the
contract.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
well,
if
he
doesn't
have
the
money,
then
the
debtor's
interest
and
property
is
not
being
adequately
protected.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
if
the
debtor
can
pay
it.
but
there
may
be
no
reason
to
pay
it.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
it
doesn't
favor
us
because
at
the
end
of
the
case,
you
are
eventually
going
to
have
the
same
result.
i
suppose
the
oversecured
creditor...
let's
say
in
both
cases
there
is
ultimately
a
default.
that
is,
the
debtor
does
not
reinstate.
the
debtor
has
defaulted.
he
may
default
at
different
points
in
the
proceeding
depending
on
when
the
judge
forces
him
to
make
these
payments.
if
he
defaults
later
in
the
proceeding,
the
oversecured
creditor
will
get
his
property
back.
in
other
words,
he
will
at
that
point
be
allowed
to
foreclose
and
if
he
is
really
oversecured,
he
is
going
to
get
back
even
more
than
that
particular
amount
of
interest.
he'll
get
back
the
whole
property.
and
that
conceivably
could
be
more.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
at
most
real
property
foreclosure
sales,
and
certainly
in
texas,
the
lender
bids
it
in,
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
other
buyers,
and
the
lender
effectively
ends
up
owning
the
property.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
if
it
is
substantial
enough.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
it
depends
how
much
the
gap
is.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
yes,
your
honor.
at
the
end
of
the
line,
the
oversecured
creditor
will
get
his
contractual
interest.
but,
if
the
debtor
elects
to
keep
the
contract
in
force
in
a
plan
of
reorganization,
the
debtor
also
will
get
the
benefit
of
contractual
interest.
there
is
one
case
on
record
where
a
court
has
attempted
to
reconcile
the
sections,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
problem
in
the
context
of
a
plan
of
reorganization
with
the
bankruptcy
court
saying
to
the
undersecured
creditor
who
has
gotten
perhaps
more
interest
than
he
would
have
under
the
contract
that
we
are
going
to
rebate
or
count
some
payments
against
you
to
make
up
for
that
difference
because
the
creditor
is
now
going
to
reinstate.
also,
i
might
add,
this
is
an
issue
that
almost
never
comes
up.
i
can't
see
it
really
ever
coming
up.
here,
it's
12
percent
interest
but
it
is
calculated
on
what
in
this
case
higher,
in
fact,
in
this
case
it's
lower
than
the
contract
amount
because
contract
interest
was
14
percent.
but
if
you
take
as
a
hypothetical
you're
getting
12
percent
interest
when
10
percent
was
the
contracted
rate,
you
are
typically
getting
it,
if
you
are
an
undersecured
creditor
on
a
principal
balance
that
is
much
less,
so
that
the
total
you
are
getting
is
still
less
than
you
would
be
getting
if
you
got
your
payments.
and
that
stands
to
reason
because
the
debtor
always
has
the
option
of
making
the
regular
payments.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
court
that
wouldn't
allow
a
debtor
to
make
the
regular
payments
of
interest
called
for
and
retain
the
property
while
the
case
is
proceeding.
i
think
this
case
involves
a
situation
where
a
creditor
has
suffered
a
very
real
loss.
no
payments
have
been
made
in
this
case.
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
put
this
issue
in
the
context
of
what
the
bankruptcy
code
did
to
it.
if
this
case
had
been
decided
under
the
bankruptcy
act
there
would
be
no
timbers
of
inwood
forest
associates,
because
an
undersecured
creditor
was
almost
invariably
entitled
to
relief
from
the
stay.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
cases
under
the
bankruptcy
act
uniformly
held
that
except
in
certain
very
limited
circumstances
where
the
secured
creditor
for
some
other
reason
was
protected,
the
secured
creditor
was
entitled
to
take
back
his
property
if
the
debtor
had
no
equity
in
it.
in
other
words,
if
he
had
no
equity,
what's
the
point
of
the
debtor
keeping
the
property?
what
the
bankruptcy
code
did
was
to
put
something
really
dramatic
into
the
code.
instead
of
just
saying
that
the
court
must
terminate
the
stay
if
there
is
inadequate
protection
or
if
some
other
standard
is
not
met,
the
code
also
allows
the
bankruptcy
court
to
condition
the
automatic
stay.
and
that
allowed
the
bankruptcy
court
in
this
case
to
do
something
it
could
not
have
done
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
under
the
bankruptcy
act
the
court
would
had
to
have
just
terminated
the
stay
when
we
filed
our
motion
under
362(d)(1).
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
stay
would
have
been
terminated
because
the
debtor
had
no
equity
in
the
property.
we
would
have
taken
the
property
back
and
would
have
been
out
of
the
bankruptcy
case.
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
court
has
an
additional
alternative.
the
court
can
say
to
the
debtor,
okay,
even
though
you
couldn't
have
kept
this
property
before,
we
will
let
you
keep
the
property.
we
will
keep
the
stay
in
effect
as
long
as
it
is
conditioned
on
something
that
protects
the
secured
creditor
from
the
costs
of
delay.
that
something
in
this
case
was
periodic
post
petition
payments,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be.
it
could
be
anything.
362(d)(1)
is
the
statute
that
gives
the
bankruptcy
court
this
authority.
it
provides
that
the
court
may
condition
the
stay.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
i
think
it
was
a
change
in
methodology.
i
don't
think
that
congress
intended
to
disadvantage
secured
creditors
at
all
in
enacting
the
bankruptcy
code.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
not
if
you
are
being
compensated
for
the
cost
of
delay.
because
what
bankruptcy
does
is
substitute
value
for
in
kind
treatment.
you
may
not
get
the
property.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
yes.
i
agree.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
i
think
very
clearly
not.
in
response
to
that,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
to
really
two
broad
things
that
are
set
forth
in
the
legislative
history.
and
i
might
say
as
an
aside
that
there
has
been
a
lot
of
argument
in
the
lower
courts
and
many
articles
written
on
this
subject
that
spends
a
lot
of
time
on
what
adequate
protection
means,
what
indubitable
equivalent
means,
various
terms
that
may
have
some
meaning
in
other
contexts
but
aren't
really
defined
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
i
think
in
getting
mixed
into
that
argument
they
sometimes
miss
the
two
really
clear
things
that
are
stated
in
the
legislative
history.
one
is
that
congress
chose,
consciously
chose,
not
to
define
the
meaning
of
value,
and
therefore
i
think
it
is
unfair
to
latch
onto
examples
in
the
legislative
history
or
little
bits
and
pieces
or
words.
congress,
in
both
the
house
and
senate
reports,
in
more
than
one
place,
made
very
clear
that
this
was
a
matter
to
be
left
to
judicial
development.
but
on
the
other
hand,
and
this
is
the
second
thing
that
is
very
important,
congress
made
very
clear
that
it
sought
to
protect
the
full
value
of
the
creditor's
interest
in
property.
in
both
the
house
and
senate
reports,
there
is
language
that
the
full
benefit
of
the
creditor's
bargain
should
be
protected,
and
an
interesting
aside
to
that
is
that
the
house
and
senate
reports
also
say
that
this
means
something
more
than
what
the
constitution
requires.
the
constitution
generally
has
been
interpreted
to
require
that
the
value
of
the
collateral
at
least
be
protected.
and
the
house
and
senate
report
said
that
adequate
protection
means
more
than
that.
it
means
that
even
though
the
creditor
may
not
be
allowed
to
foreclose
exactly
on
default
or
exactly
at
the
time
when
he
might
under
state
law,
even
though
he
might
not
get
in
kind
what
he
is
entitled
to
under
state
law,
that
nevertheless
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
value
of
what
he
gets
under
state
law.
i
think
that
if
you
begin
with
this
thing,
that
congress
wanted
to
protect
the
value
of
the
creditor's
interest
in
property,
in
this
case
the
value
of
a
mortgage,
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
costs
of
delay
must
be
protected,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
that
is
the
essence
of
the
secured
creditor's
rights.
the
secured
creditor
has
a
right
under
his
mortgage
to
foreclose
on
default.
the
secured
creditor,
with
all
due
respect
to
this
apartment
project,
doesn't
want
the
project.
united
savings
doesn't
want
to
own
this
property.
united
savings
wants
to
use
the
property
as
a
means
to
recover
its
loan,
and
it
does
that
by
having
it
sold
at
foreclosure
sale
as
soon
as
it
is
entitled
to
under
the
mortgage,
taking
that
money,
putting
it
out
at
interest,
and
the
quicker
it
can
do
that
and
the
more
interest
it
can
earn,
the
quicker
it
can
recover
its
debt.
moreover,
and
i
think
this
is
another
very,
very
crucial
thing
that
as
overlooked
by
the
court
below,
this
value,
this
time
value
of
money,
is
something
that
is
protected
under
non-bankruptcy
law.
no
one
would
doubt
that
a
fee
simple
interest
in
property
is
worth
more
than
a
future
interest
in
property.
i
don't
think
anybody
would
doubt
that.
surely
it
follows
that
a
temporary
deprivation
of
an
interest
in
property
decreases
its
value,
and
in
fact,
in
another
context,
this
court
held
recently,
in
first
english
evangelical
lutheran
church,
that
an
owner's
interest
in
property
was
decreased
when,
for
a
period
of
time,
he
was
temporarily
deprived
of
that
interest.
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
reason
for
treating
security
interests
any
differently.
if
the
secured
creditor
is
deprived
of
his
property
for
a
period
of
time,
the
value
of
that
security
interest
is
less.
for
example--
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
--certainly.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
yes.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
yes,
although
the
question
is
phrased
a
little
bit
differently.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
i
think
the
mistake
in
that
analysis
is
that
adequate
protection,
the
(d)(1)
section,
is
not
directed
just
to
this.
it
could
have
been
written
a
lot
more
specifically
to
set
out,
for
example,
in
single
asset
cases,
these
are
the
rules.
but
instead
the
code
required
adequate
protection
of
an
interest
in
property.
and
it
could
have
been
written
differently.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
(d)(2)
is
not
necessarily
limited
to
a
single
asset
case.
it
would
apply
to
any.
obviously,
you
are
moving
for
relief
from
the
stay
with
respect
to
a
single
asset.
in
(d)(2),
one
thing
that
enters
into
the
analysis
that
i
might
add
is
that
the
second
part
of
the
test
on
(d)(2)
which
requires
that
there
be
a
reasonable
hope
of
reorganization,
doesn't
require
rehabilitation
because
a
reorganization
can
include
a
liquidating
plan.
there
are
many
circumstances
in
which
a
debtor
may
have
no
equity
in
the
property,
yet,
nonetheless
believe
that
it
could
successfully
reorganize,
for
example,
by
capital
infusion
or
by
a
liquidating
plan.
there
are
all
kinds
of
things.
so
there
are
circumstances
where
you
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
relief
under
(d)(2),
but
you
would
still
be
entitled
to
some
kind
of
relief,
not
necessarily
termination
of
the
stay,
but
some
kind
of
relief
under
(d)(1).
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
i
think
an
example
would
be...
i
can
think
of
more
than
one.
you
might
have
a
multiple
asset
case
where
the
debtor
has
no
equity
in
property
and
therefore
there
is
some
reason
for
relief
under
(d)(1),
but
nevertheless,
it
is
necessary
for
an
effective
reorganization,
because
the
debtor
is
using
that
property
and
cannot
easily
replace
it.
so
the
creditor
may
not
be
entitled
to
any
relief
under
(d)(2)
but
may
be
entitled
to
relief
under
(d)(1).
another
circumstance
would
be,
in
a
single
asset
case,
where
the
debtor
has--
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
--it
might
be
a
different
kind
of
relief.
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
it
would
be
the
situation,
i'll
give
you
an
example,
where
the
creditor
comes
in
and
says
we
will
offer
you
adequate
protection
by
giving
you
a
lien
on
other
property
or
by
paying
adequate
protection
payments
or
doing
something
that
meets
the
requirements
of
(d)(1).
and
the
creditor
says
i
don't
want
to
fool
around
with
this
bankruptcy
case.
even
though
you
are
going
to
offer
me
something
that
adequately
protects
my
interest,
under
(d)(2),
if
there
is
no
equity
in
the
property
and
this
property
is
not
necessary
to
an
effective
reorganization,
i
get
it
back.
in
other
words,
(d)(1)
allows
the
debtor
to
hold
onto
the
property,
possibly
for
a
period
of
time
beyond
which
he
might
reasonably
reorganize,
or
beyond
which
there
may
be
some
reasonable
hope
of
reorganization.
so
the
debtor
may
not
want
to
take
advantage
of
it
but
he
may
want
to,
and
the
creditor
may
say
no.
with
the
court's
permission,
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
i
would
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
justice
stevens'
question
and
just
make
clear
what
our
position
is
on
the
briggs
issue,
also.
first
of
all,
united's
position
is
that
a
secured
creditor,
as
well
as
others
with
interest
in
property
of
the
estate...
that
may
be
a
co-owner,
or
a
spouse
with
interest
in
community
property,
anyone
with
interest
in
property
of
the
estate...
is
entitled
to
protection
for
the
costs
of
delay
imposed
by
the
automatic
stay.
that
does
not
necessarily
require
and
it
is
not
our
position
that
that
would
necessarily
require
periodic
post-petition
payments.
adequate
protection
may
take
the
form
of
an
equity
cushion
in
the
property,
it
may
take
the
form
of
an
alternative
lien,
it
may
take
the
form
of
a
reorganization
proposal
or
rehabilitation
that
is
going
to
increase
the
value
of
the
property
such
as
the
completion
of
goods
in
process
where
a
lender
has
a
security
interest
in
manufacturing
goods.
so
that
is
going
to
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
our
position
is
that
some
protection
ought
to
be
required.
secondly,
we
agree
with
the
respondent
that
briggs
is
not
a
very
good
response
to
this
problem.
i
think
what
briggs
does
is
tell
each
individual
bankruptcy
court
to
answer
a
legal
question.
that
legal
question
being
whether
the
time
value
of
the
secured
creditor's
rights
are
entitled
to
protection.
i
think
that
is
a
legal
question
and
it
ought
to
be
answered
by
the
appellate
courts.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
no,
i
don't
agree
with
the
way
he
sees
it.
in
fact,
we
may
be
looking
at
two
different
things.
i
think
he
is
looking
at
cases
that
deal
with
reorganizations.
i'm
dealing
with
cases,
and
the
briefs
set
forth
the
cases
that
have
to
do
with
motions
for
relief
from
stay.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
yes.
but
the
automatic
stay--
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
--there
are
two
different
periods
of
time.
the
automatic
stay
won't
take
effect
until
a
plan
of
reorganization
is
confirmed.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
and
there
may
be
different
standards
or
different
rules
of
law
involved
at
such
point
as
the
plaintiff's
reorganization
is
confirmed.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
yes.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
yes.
but
i
have
to
answer
it
by
saying
that
it's
not
a
yes
or
no
question.
there
would
not
have
been
an
order
conditioning
the
stay
on
periodic
payments
or
something
else
to
protect
time
value.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
no,
but
i
believed
there
would
be
protection
for
time
value
because
the
court
would
have
terminated
the
stay
and
given
the
creditor
his
property
back.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
yes,
if
the
debtor
had
no
equity
in
property.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
yes,
as
i
read
the
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
briefs,
where
the
debtor
had
no
equity
in
property.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
in
a
reorganization
case.
that
is
correct.
in
any
kind
of
case
where
the
debtor
had
no
equity
in
the
property
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
saved
for
the
estate,
almost
invariably
the
stay
was
terminated.
and
that
is
why
this
precise
issue,
payment
of
lost
opportunity
costs
didn't
really
arise
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
i
think
they
are
inapposite.
i
think
that
they
are
read
out
of
context.
there
is
really
a
different
issue.
under
the
bankruptcy
code
you
have
an
ability
to
condition
the
stay
and
that
raises
the
whole
issue
of
what
periodic
payments
or
what
other
protection
should
be
fashioned.
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
protection
for
the
cost
of
delay
was
provided
in
a
different
way
by
simply
terminating
the
stay.
i
would
like
to
return
finally
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
to
again
make
clear
our
position.
the
petitioner
does
not
rely
so
heavily
on
the
phrases
"adequate
protection"
and
"indubitable
equivalent"
as
the
respondent
suggests.
i
do
think
that
an
analysis
of
those
words
supports
our
position
and
those
arguments
are
set
forth
in
the
brief.
but
i
think
a
better
argument
and
one
that
perhaps
goes
more
to
the
heart
of
the
issue
is
found
by
looking
at
the
wording
of
sections
361(1)
and
(2)
which
describe
the
objects
of
adequate
protection.
those
sections
are
directed
to
decreases
in
the
value
of
an
interest
in
property...
in
this
case
a
mortgage...
so
they
are
directed
to
decreases
in
the
value
of
the
mortgage
that
result
from
the
automatic
stay.
i
think
there
is
no
serious
question
in
this
case
that
the
automatic
stay
and
the
delay
that
is
caused
by
the
automatic
stay,
does
result
in
a
decrease
in
the
value
of
a
mortgage.
the
bankruptcy
court
made
specific
findings
as
to
what
that
damage
was
and
how
that
value
was
decreased.
those
findings
have
never
been
questioned
by
the
respondent
and
were
not
questioned
by
the
court
below.
it
is
clear
that
the
value
of
that
mortgage
decreased
as
a
result
of
the
automatic
stay.
it
is
also
clear
that
that
value
is
protected
under
state
law
under
analogous
causes
of
actions
that
might
be
filed
under
state
law.
now,
if
congress
sought
to
protect
the
full
value
of
creditors'
interest
in
property,
to
protect
the
benefit
of
their
bargain,
how
could
it
be
that
this
important
element
of
value
that
is
recognized
by
state
courts
is
somehow
omitted?
that
is
not
suggested
in
the
legislative
history
and
i
think
it
is
clear
that
that
element
of
value
should
be
protected.
otherwise,
we're
left
in
a
very
odd
position,
which
is
that
a
congress,
which
has
directed
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
full
value
of
rights
and
property
should
be
protected,
will
somehow
have
enacted
a
statute
that
leaves
secured
creditors
worse
off
than
they
were
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
absolutely.
the
only
reason
that
i
go
into
what
the
law
was
before
enactment
of
the
code
is
to
put
in
context
some
of
the
examples
that
were
used
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
h.
miles
cohn
no,
absolutely
not.
i
think
it
helps
put
in
context
some
of
the
arguments
that
are
made
against
our
position,
but
the
statute
as
written
directs
and
defines
the
object
of
adequate
protection
as
the
value
of
the
creditor's
interest
in
property,
the
value
of
the
mortgage,
in
particular
directs
that
the
secured
creditor
be
protected
to
the
extent
that
that
value
is
decreased
by
the
automatic
stay.
and
i
think
it
is
clear,
as
the
bankruptcy
court
found,
that
if
the
automatic
stay
keeps
the
creditor
from
foreclosing
for
a
period
of
time,
then
the
value
of
that
mortgage
is
decreased.
and
that
is
what
ought
to
be
protected.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
conclude.
