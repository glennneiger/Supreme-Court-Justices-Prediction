justice
o'connor
mr.
cohn,
were
you
representing
the
client
in
the
proceedings
below?
justice
o'connor
and
was
a
petition
ever
filed
with
the
bankruptcy
court
for
relief
from
the
stay
under
section
362(d)(2)?
justice
o'connor
i
just
wondered
why
no
petition
was
filed
for
relief
from
the
stay.
justice
o'connor
did
the
debtor
have
any
equity
in
the
property
here?
justice
o'connor
no,
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
and
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
that
the
oversecured
creditor
would,
at
the
end
of
the
line,
get
the
contractual
interest,
not
the
amount
of
interest
that
you
say
the
undersecured
creditor
might
be
entitled
to
get?
