justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
there?
that
is
a
higher
return
than
they
would
have
gotten
if
there
had
been
no
default,
i
take
it?
justice
stevens
one
of
the
rights
you
seek
to
protect
is
the
right
to
get
the
benefits
out
of
a
foreclosure
to
which
you
have
a
legal
entitlement,
which
may
be
better
than
having
the
debt
paid
according
to
its
original
terms.
if
that
right
is
to
be
protected,
should
it
not
also
be
protected
for
the
oversecured
creditor?
justice
stevens
but
he
doesn't
get
the
same
benefit
that
the
undersecured
creditor
gets.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
but
he
doesn't
get
the
12
percent
rate.
you
are
getting
12
percent,
if
i
understand
you.
justice
stevens
not
if
he
doesn't
have
the
money.
justice
stevens
he
does
not
get
to
keep
the
overage.
he
can
sell
it
off
and
use
the
proceeds
of
sale
to
pay
off
the
debt,
but
he
can't
keep
a
profit.
justice
stevens
if
the
property
is
substantially
oversecured,
if
the
debt
is
substantially
oversecured,
presumably
the
property
would
sell
for
more
than
the
obligation.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
stevens
i
hesitate
to
interrupt.
but
i
want
to
be
sure
about
your
position.
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
filed
by
a
professor
nimmer
from
michigan
concludes
that,
urges
that
there
is
neither
a
requirement
of
post-petition
interest,
which
your
opponent
asks
for,
nor
its
absolute
preclusion
is
warranted
under
the
terms.
do
you
take
the
position
that
it
is
absolutely
precluded?
justice
stevens
you
do.
and
there
is
no
middle
ground.
so
you
disagree,
i
think
you
disagree
with
judge
clark
then
in
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
i
thought
it
did.
i
will
read
it
again.
but
i
thought
he
did.
justice
stevens
i
don't'
think
it
is
entirely
clear
in
the
majority
opinion
whether
they
agree
completely
with
your
view
either.
but
your
view
is
it
is
absolutely
prohibited?
