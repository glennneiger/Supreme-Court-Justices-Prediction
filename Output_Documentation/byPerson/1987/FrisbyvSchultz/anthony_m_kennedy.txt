but
what
is
a
picket,
does
a
picket
have
to
have
a
sign?
justice
kennedy
suppose
he
just
stands
there
handing
our
leaflets,
but
he
stands
right
at
the
one
stop,
is
that
picketing?
justice
kennedy
i
will
give
you
the
facts.
the
lot
is
sixty
feet.
and
just
in
order
to
amuse
himself,
he
goes
up
on
the
sixty
feet
until
somebody
comes
out,
and
then
he
gives
him
the
leaflet.
justice
kennedy
suppose
he
just
stands
in
one
spot
and
hands
out
the
leaflet,
is
that
a
picket?
justice
kennedy
but
if
he
moves
ten
feet
of
the
way,
then
that
is
a
picket?
justice
kennedy
in
your
answer
to
justice
stevens,
you
indicated
that
privacy
is
a
protectable
interest
insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned,
the
privacy
of
homes?
justice
kennedy
can
it
be
protected
from
picketing
in
any
degree?
justice
kennedy
do
you
have
a
right
to
a
quiet
street?
justice
kennedy
is
there
a
right
to
a
quiet
street?
justice
kennedy
but
some
picketing
can
be
regulated
in
order
to
preserve
the
character
of
the
residential
neighborhood?
justice
kennedy
so
picketing
can
interfere
with
privacy
and
with
residential
character,
and
to
that
extent
can
be
regulated?
justice
kennedy
but
you
indicate
that
it
can
in
some
instances?
justice
kennedy
well,
has
the
court
confronted
a
case
where
the
public
forum
doctrine
has
squarely
measured
against
the
interest
of
the
homeowner
and
privacy
and
quiet?
justice
kennedy
and
that
went
off
on
equal
protection
grounds.
justice
kennedy
and
in
that
case,
we
also
said
that
there
is
a
very
strong
interest,
a
very
strong
constitutional
recognition,
of
the
right
of
privacy.
justice
kennedy
and
under
justice
stevens'
question,
this
could
go
on
365
days
a
year
as
far
as
you
are
concerned?
justice
kennedy
365
days
a
year?
