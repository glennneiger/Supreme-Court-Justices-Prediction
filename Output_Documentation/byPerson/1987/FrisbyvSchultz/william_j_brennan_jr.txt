now
this
picketing
was
at
the
doctor's
home,
was
it
not?
justice
jr.
he
did
not
operate
a
clinic,
did
he,
from
his
home?
justice
jr.
it
was
just
where
he
lived?
justice
jr.
none
in
brookfield?
justice
jr.
near
this
residence,
is
the
commercial
area
anywhere
near
this
residence?
justice
jr.
what
is
the
width
of
the
street
there?
justice
jr.
any
sidewalks?
justice
jr.
we
have
no
record
as
to
the
conduct
of
the
pickets;
there
was
picketing,
was
there
not?
justice
jr.
and
what
was
their
conduct?
justice
jr.
how,
vocally
or
signs?
justice
jr.
mr.
mcdowell,
is
this
a
facial
attack
on
the
ordinance?
justice
jr.
well,
if
it
is,
then
i
take
that
if
there
is
any
set
of
facts
that
we
can
think
about
picketing
to
which
the
ordinance
could
constitutionally
be
applied,
you
lose,
do
you
not,
if
it
is
a
facial
attack?
justice
jr.
why
do
you
say
that
it
is
not
narrowly
tailored
to
support
privacy
and
safety?
justice
jr.
as
to
privacy?
justice
jr.
how
do
you
tailor
this
more
narrowly
than
an
absolute
prohibition?
justice
jr.
for
example,
they
have
an
ordinance
or
law
of
some
kind
under
which
the
picketers
for
crowding
and
such
numbers
on
the
lawn
could
be
arrested?
justice
jr.
could
they
be
arrested
for
violation
of
that
ordinance?
justice
jr.
is
there
any
way
that
they
could
not
be
on
the
lawn?
