justice
o'connor
mr.
fuhrman,
we
are
reviewing,
i
guess,
the
preliminary
injunction.
so
is
our
standard
of
review
whether
the
lower
court
abused
its
discretion
in
the
issuance
of
the
injunction?
justice
o'connor
you
still
want
to
go
to
trial?
justice
o'connor
mr.
fuhrman,
would
the
town
prohibit
appellees
from
standing
in
the
street
in
front
of
the
house
and
handing
out
leaflets
containing
the
same
messages
as
on
the
signs?
justice
o'connor
even
if
he
is
not
carrying
a
sign?
justice
o'connor
mr.
fuhrman,
do
you
say
that
a
single
picketer,
let
us
say
present
one
hour
a
day,
in
front
of
a
residence
substantially
interferes
with
the
residential
privacy?
justice
o'connor
for
one
hour
a
day
or
half
an
hour
a
day?
justice
o'connor
or
once
a
week?
justice
o'connor
sufficiently
substantial
to
justify
the
first
amendment
infringement?
justice
o'connor
mr.
fuhrman,
do
you
think
that
the
first
amendment
under
that
precedent
would
enable
a
city
to
prevent
door
to
door
solicitation
and
the
actual
ringing
of
the
doorbell?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
this
court's
precedence
would
support
your
view?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
that
this
court
had
spoken
to
that
issue.
justice
o'connor
but
before
us
today,
i
guess
that
mr.
fuhrman
says
that
he
does
not
now
want
a
trial.
is
that
what
you
heard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
is
before
us
on
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
it
presents
a
facial
first
amendment
challenge
to
an
ordinance
enacted
by
the
town
of
brookfield,
wisconsin
that
prohibits
residential
picketing.
the
district
court
held
that
the
ordinance
violated
the
first
amendment.
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
this
panel
decision
was
vacated
however
and
the
case
was
reheard
en
banc
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
ultimately
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
vote.
the
town
appealed
here
and
we
postponed
consideration
of
jurisdiction
until
the
hearing
on
the
merits.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
now
reverse.
rather
than
decide
whether
appellate
jurisdiction
is
proper,
we
choose
to
treat
the
jurisdictional
statement
as
a
petition
for
a
certiorari
and
have
granted
certiorari.
the
ordinance
operates
against
speech
in
a
public
forum
since
it
bans
picketing
on
the
public
streets.
the
fact
that
the
streets
or
residential
does
not
affect
the
first
amendment
analysis,
but
since
the
ordinance
is
content-neutral,
it
is
permissible
if
it
leaves
open
ample
alternative
channels
of
communication
and
if
it
is
narrowly
tailored
to
serve
as
significant
government
interest.
we
conclude
that
the
ordinance
passes
this
test.
in
order
to
avoid
constitutional
problems,
we
narrowly
construe
the
scope
of
the
ordinance
as
limited
to
picketing
targeted
at
a
single
residence.
so
construed,
the
ordinance
leaves
out
an
ample
alternative
since
marching,
leafleting,
or
even
more
broadly
focus
picketing
is
not
prohibited.
the
ordinance
serves
the
significant
interest
of
protecting
residential
privacy
and
the
tranquility
of
the
home.
within
their
own
homes,
individuals
should
not
be
forced
to
listen
to
a
speech
they
do
not
want
to
hear.
since
the
very
means
of
expression
involved
is
inherently
damaging
the
residential
privacy.
the
picketing
ban
is
narrowly
tailored.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
joins.
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
