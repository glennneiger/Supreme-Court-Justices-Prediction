mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
this
judgment
was
adopted
by
an
equally
divided
court
from
a
vote
of
five
to
five.
the
effect
of
the
judgment
was
to
affirm
the
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin.
that
order
contained
an
injunction
that
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
an
ordinance
of
the
town
of
brookfield.
that
ordinance
provided
for
the
prohibition
of
picketing
before
and
about
any
residence
or
dwelling
in
the
town
of
brookfield.
after
that
ordinance
was
adopted,
the
appellees
commenced
this
legal
action
seeking
declaratory
relief
and
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
ordinance.
they
immediately
asked
for
a
preliminary
injunction,
and
that
was
granted.
in
the
request
for
the
preliminary
injunction,
it
was
argued
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
as
well
as
the
first
amendment,
and
that
particular
part
of
the
argument
of
the
appelles
was
not
ruled
upon
favorably
by
the
district
court,
and
there
was
no
cross
appeal
from
that
particular
part
of
the
order.
an
appeal
from
the
order
as
a
whole
was
taken
by
the
appellants,
that
is
by
the
town
of
brookfield,
and
proceeded
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
before
all
of
this
occurred,
i
should
point
out
that
the
initial
ordinance
adopted
by
the
town
of
brookfield
provided
an
exception
to
the
prohibition
against
picketing,
namely
an
exception
in
favor
of
labor
disputes.
when
the
town
attorney
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
that
ordinance
had
been
adopted,
he
advised
the
chief
of
police
not
to
enforce
it
until
he
had
an
opportunity
to
study
its
constitutionality.
after
he
had
reread
the
case
of
carey
v.
brown,
he
advised
the
town
board
to
repeal
that
ordinance
in
deference
to
this
court's
decision
in
carey
v.
brown.
the
town
board
did
precisely
that.
subsequently,
they
adopted
the
current
ordinance,
which
has
a
uniform
prohibition
against
residential
picketing
without
any
exception.
and
this
also
was
in
recognition
of
footnote
number
two
of
this
court's
decision
carey
v.
brown
in
which
this
court
stated
that
it
was
reserving
judgment
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
ordinance
that
uniformly
prohibited
picketing
without
exception--
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
--the--
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
--well,
footnote
two
reads
as
follows,
"because
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
labor
dispute
exception
was
not
severable
from
the
remainder
of
the
statute,
it
invalidated
the
enactment
in
its
entirety.
"
"the
court
therefore
found
it
unnecessary
to
consider
the
constitutionality
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
statute
that
prohibited
all
residential
picketing.
"
"because
find
the
present
statute
defective
on
equal
protection
principles,
we
likewise
do
not
consider
whether
a
statute
barring
all
residential
picketing
regardless
of
its
subject
matter
would
violate
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
"
and
so
that
situation
then
is
now
a
situation
that
is
squarely
before
the
court
today.
because
we
do
have
an
ordinance
that
prohibits
all
residential
picketing
without
the
labor
exception.
the
fact
situation
that
gave
rise
to
the
adoption
of
these
two
ordinances
was
a
period
of
picketing
of
approximately
three
weeks
that
had
been
conducted
by
the
appellees
and
their
associates
before
the
home
of
one
dr.
benjamin
victoria,
a
resident
of
the
town
of
brookfield.
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
was
to
denounce
him
as
an
abortionist
and
as
a
killer
of
babies.
the
town
board
had
no
desire
to
get
involved
in
this
debate.
however,
it
was
appalled
at
the
invasion
of
privacy
that
occurred,
and
also
it
was
appalled
at
the
very
serious--
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
--it
was
at
the
doctor's
home.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
no,
he
did
it.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
that
was
just
where
he
lived.
in
fact,
he
had
two
clinics,
one
in
milwaukee,
and
one
in
another
city,
but
not
in
his
home.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
none
in
the
town
of
brookfield,
right.
so
in
oral
argument
today,
i
propose
to
concentrate
on
three
principal
points.
the
first
is
that
the
district
court
order
was
filed,
and
it
was
a
final
order.
second,
that
the
residential
streets
of
the
town
of
brookfield
are
not
public
fora.
and
third,
that
assuming
arguendo
that
the
streets
of
the
town
of
brookfield
are
public
fora,
that
nevertheless
that
the
ordinance
is
a
valid
and
constitutional
regulation
of
time,
place
and
manner,
and
to
achieve
two
important
governmental
interests,
the
one
being
residential
privacy,
and
the
other
being
public
safety.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
we
contend
that
it
is
not.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
perhaps
at
this
point
that
although
the
order
of
the
district
court
is
in
form
a
preliminary
injunction,
actually
however,
it
has
finally
decided
the
constitutional
issue
involved,
at
least
from
the
standpoint
of
the
district
court.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
no.
let
me
explain.
the
preliminary
injunction
so-called
said
that
it
would
become
final
in
the
event
that
there
were
no
requests
for
a
trial,
number
one,
by
any
party;
and
number
two,
that
an
appeal
would
be
taken.
so
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
town
of
brookfield,
we
did
appeal
and
we
did
file
a
request
for
a
trial.
but
it
is
clear
from
a
reading
of
the
order
that
the
court
had
already
determined
that
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
and
there
were
two
reasons
for
that.
number
one,
it
was
stipulated
by
both
parties
that
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
not
necessary.
and
number
two,
the
way
in
which
this
ordinance
was
attacked
by
the
plaintiffs
was
not
in
a
factual
context
at
all.
they
attacked
it
facially
before
it
ever
had
an
opportunity
to
be
enforced.
shortly
after
the
ordinance
was
adopted,
there
was
a
request
for
the
preliminary
injunction.
and
so
this
particular
ordinance
has
yet
to
be
enforced.
and
so
there
is
no
factual
context
within
which
the
district
court
could
construe
the
ordinance.
it
is
purely
a
matter
of
law.
if
there
were
to
be
a
trial,
the
trial
would
be
purely
on
that
constitutional
issue.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
although
the
ordinance
contains
no
definition
section,
in
our
opinion,
picketing
would
be
having
the
picket
proceed
on
a
definite
course
or
route
in
front
of
a
home.
because
keep
in
mind,
the
ordinance
only
prohibits
picketing
before
and
about
a
dwelling
or
a
residence.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
that
is
right.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
that
would
not
qualify.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
in
the
town
of
brookfield,
under
this
ordinance,
it
would
be.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
the
damage
would
be
to
privacy.
because
the
ordinance
is
content
neutral.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
message
at
all.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
if
as
justice
scalia
asked,
it
was
a
march,
the
answer
would
be
that
it
would
not
be
in
violation
of
the
ordinance.
however,
if
the
pickets
actually
pursued
a
route
only
in
front
of
this
particular
house,
any
particular
he
use
which
is
targeted,
then
it
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
it
is
an
uncontested
fact,
yes.
there
are
two
commercial
areas
in
the
town
of
brookfield
along
the
bluemound
road.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
no.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
it
is
elsewhere.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
i
would
estimate
approximately
three
miles.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
the
width
of
the
residential
streets
in
the
town
of
brookfield
are
thirty
feet.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
and
there
are
no
sidewalks,
and
no
curb
and
gutter.
and
this,
of
course,
brings
you
into
focusing
upon
the
public
safety
aspect.
and
i
should
point
out
that
in
our
brief
that
we
incorporated
by
reference
the
opinion
of
judge
coffey
of
the
seventh
circuit,
and
it
was
his
dissenting
opinion.
and
the
reason
that
we
did
that
was
because
among
other
things,
he
has
in
his
opinion
a
very
good
analysis
of
the
safety
aspect
of
this
case,
and
it
is
printed
in
the
joint
appendix.
and
if
it
has
not
been
read
by
any
member
of
the
court,
i
would
urge
its
being
read,
because
i
think
that
it
is
very
helpful
to
understand
the
case.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
there
was
picketing.
and
there
is
a
record
of
its
conduct.
the
picketing
occurred,
however,
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
ordinance.
and
the
reason
why
that
record
exists
is
because
the
picketers
had
to
show
their
standing
to
bring
the
action.
and
they,
of
course,
had
been
picketing
right
up
until
the
time
that
the
legislation
was
adopted.
so
when
the
legislation
was
adopted,
they
then
commenced
their
action
and
applied
for
the
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
well,
there
were
pickets
of
eleven
to
forty
people
picketing
off
and
on
over
a
period
of
approximately
three
weeks.
their
conduct
was
to
denounce
the
doctor.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
both,
both
vocally
and
by
sign.
he
was
described
as
a
baby
killer,
and
there
were
other
picturesque
phrases
that
are
in
the
record.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
yes,
among
other
things.
yes,
justice
marshall.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
no,
we
are
not
complaining
about
that.
we
are
complaining
about
two
things.
the
invasion
of
the
privacy
of
this
residence,
and
also
the
threat
to
public
safety.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
yes,
we
are.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
in
the
event
that
you
have
a
parade
rather
than
simply
a
picket,
you
do
have
a
less
hazardous
situation.
we
concede,
first
of
all,
that
any
walking
on
the
street
by
pedestrians
is
dangerous.
but
it
is
more
dangerous
if
you
have
a
picket
line.
because
you
have
these
people
not
actually
in
continuing
movement,
but
you
have
them
moving
only
a
short
distance,
and
then
following
their
picket
route,
you
see.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
well,
the
record
contains
instances
of
interference,
which
of
course
goes
beyond
picketing,
such
as
obstructing
the
driveway
and
trespassing
upon
property.
now
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
appellees,
there
are
ordinances
addressed
to
those
particular
problems.
the
point
that
we
are
discussing
today
really
is
the
picketing
ordinance
itself.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
no.
it
is
our
understanding
that
leafleting
is
not
covered
by
this
ordinance.
now
i
could
conceive
of
a
situation
where
a
picketer
might
have
leaflets
and
do
two
different
things.
but
leafleting
is
not
picketing.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
he
does
not
have
to
have
a
sign.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
if
he
is
following
a
picket
route,
he
is
picketing.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
all
right.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
he
is
performing
two
functions.
one,
he
is
picketing;
and
one,
he
is
leafleting.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
not
a
picket.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
if
he
is
moving
and
following
a
picket
route,
he
is
a
picket,
right.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
that
is
true.
for
instance,
although
i
am
not
aware
of
any
appellate
court
decisions
on
this,
there
have
been
instances
where
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan
has
picketed
from
one
point
to
another
point
following
a
picket
route
in
a
residential
area.
and
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
then
it
would
not
be
picketing
within
the
meaning
of
our
ordinance.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
i
understand
what
you
are
saying.
and
i
am
simply
drawing
a
distinction
between
picketing
and
parade.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
i
certainly
do.
let
us
just
take
the
ku
klux
klan
picketer
that
i
just
mentioned
before.
certainly,
one
picket
making
that
route
back
and
forth
in
front
of
one
home
that
he
is
targeting
would
violate
the
privacy.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
yes,
ma'am.
i
would
say
so.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
i
would
say
that
if
he
did
it
once
a
week,
that
it
would
also
be
a
violation
of
the
privacy
of
that
home.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
it
certainly
would.
the
second
point
that
we
planned
to
discuss
was
the
matter
of
the
streets
of
brookfield
not
being
a
public
fora.
now
we
realize,
of
course,
that
there
are
cases
that
have
substantial
dicta
indicating
a
repetition
of
the
cliche
that
streets
are
quintessential
public
fora
since
time
immemorial.
and
we
believe
that
the
key
word
in
that
cliche
is
the
word
immemorial.
we
realize
that--
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
--touche.
nevertheless,
i
think
that
we
have
to
really
realize
the
historical
origin
of
this.
many,
many
years
ago,
the
streets
of
ancient
rome
converged
upon
a
public
square
known
as
the
forum.
and
all
of
the
principal
building
were
at
the
forum,
and
that
forum
was
certainly
the
place
of
discussion
and
of
debate.
and
all
other
forums
have
derive
their
names
from
that
location.
we
submit,
however,
that
in
20th
century
united
states
that
to
say
that
every
street
is
a
public
forum
is
simply
a
statement
contrary
to
fact.
take
for
instance,
the
major
arteries
of
the
interstate
highway
system.
here
you
have
a
system
of
arteries
that
penetrate
all
of
the
major
cities
of
the
united
states.
and
nevertheless,
they
are--
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
--i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
right.
but
they
are
cordoned
off
by
cyclone
fences
from
the
pedestrians
and
for
a
darn
good
reason.
because
the
volume
of
traffic
and
the
velocity
of
traffic
is
such
that
to
say
that
that
would
be
a
forum
for
picketing
and
other
forensic
activity
is
just
ridiculous.
and
nevertheless,
we
have
the
old
cliche
or
fundamental
principle.
and
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
the
opposite
extreme.
we
have
these
thirty
foot
roads
in
suburban
brookfield
which
are
so
small
and
so
narrow
that
only
one
car
can
travel
in
each
direction
at
the
same
time,
no
curbs,
no
gutters,
no
sidewalks.
basically,
it
is
an
inherently
hazardous
situation
for
any
pedestrian
as
a
matter
of
res
ipsa
loquitur,
simply
by
accepting
these
basic
facts
which
are
undisputed.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
or
across
his
neighbor's
lawn.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
well,
trespassing
is
a
mater
of
intent,
because
of
the
neighbor
consensus.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
this
does
happen.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
no,
it
is
twenty
miles
an
hour.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
no.
and
of
course,
i
would
concede
that
any
pedestrian
on
these
streets
is
to
some
extent--
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
--well,
this
is
the
reason
why
i
am
suggesting
reading
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
coffey.
because
he
not
only
talks
about
the
protection
of
the
picketer,
but
he
also
discusses
the
responsibility
of
the
municipality
for
the
safety
of
all
people
on
the
public
highways.
this
is
quite
a
separate
argument
from
frankly
what
to
me
is
more
persuasive,
the
interest
of
the
resident
in
not
having
someone
who
is
arguably
hostile
out
in
front
all
day
long.
that
is
the
interest
frankly
that
would
concern
me
more
than
worrying
about
whether
the
fellow
would
step
in
front
of
fifteen
mile
an
hour
school
bus
or
something
like
that.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
well,
carey
v.
brown
primarily
dealt
with
the
matter
of
privacy.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
and
in
fact--
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
--we
believe
that
this
court
should
follow
its
own
precedent
that
it
established
in
the
city
of
renton
case,
and
protect
residential
privacies.
in
carey
v.
brown,
this
court
stated,
"preserving
the
sanctity
of
the
home,
the
one
retreat
to
which
men
and
women
can
repair
to
escape
from
the
tribulations
of
their
daily
pursuits,
is
surely
an
important
issue.
"
"our
decisions
reflect
no
lack
of
solicitude
for
the
right
of
an
individual
to
be
let
alone
in
the
privacy
of
a
home,
sometimes
the
last
citadel
of
the
tired,
the
weary
and
the
sick.
"
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
i
would
say
that
personally
that
an
ordinance
to
that
effect
could
be
constitutionally
valid.
i
would
have
to
naturally
recognize--
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
--first
of
all,
i
believe
at
this
time,
we
are
not
arguing
that
point
of
course,
and
we
believe
that
there
has
been
a
division
among
the
circuits
on
that
issue.
and
as
far
as
the
seventh
circuit
is
concerned,
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
watseka
case,
had
determined
that
this
type
of
activity
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
this
court
did,
because
it
actually
confirmed
the
decision
in
the
watseka
case.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
leafleting.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
said
that
i
do
draw
a
line
between
leafleting
and
picketing.
and
justice
o'connor
had
asked
that
question
before.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
the
ordinance
of
the
town
of
brookfield
only
relates
to
picketing.
it
does
not
relate
to
leafleting.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
from
a
constitutional--
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
--well,
they
do
to
some
extent.
although
picketing
is
more
invasive,
because
you
are
actually--
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
--i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
we
are
against
invading
the
privacy
of
the
home.
and
leafleting
is
less
invasive
in
that
regard
than
picketing.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
less
disturbing,
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
the
rule
that
we
believe
that
the
court
should
follow
is
the
rule
of
cornelius
v.
naacp.
we
believe
that
like
other
publicly
owned
property,
that
each
street
should
be
determined
as
to
whether
or
not
it
lends
itself
to
the
first
amendment
activity.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
i
agree.
but
we
have
in
our
argument
really
two
propositions.
number
one,
we
are
arguing
that
streets,
the
residential
streets
of
brookfield,
are
not
public
fora.
and
the
reason
that
we
are
making
that
argument
is
because
that
establishes
a
different
standard
for
evaluating
the
ordinance.
but
we
are
arguing,
number
two,
that
in
the
event
that
this
court
should
find
that
notwithstanding
everything
that
i
have
said
that
all
streets
without
exception
are
public
fora,
that
then
in
that
event
that
the
ordinance
is
still
constitutional
as
a
valid
time,
place
and
manner,
regulation
of
two
important
governmental
interests.
mr.
harold
h.
fuhrman
well,
if
you
had
litigation
on
each
and
every
street,
yes.
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
believe
that
reason
would
enter
in
here.
because
if
you
look
at
the
streets
of
the
town
of
brookfield,
and
you
know
that
they
are
thirty
feet
in
width,
you
should
know
that
you
do
not
have
public
fora.
