justice
marshall
suppose
you
were
walking
by
a
home
with
a
picket
sign
that
said,
"i
am
against
the
war
in
the
asian
gulf.
"
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
marshall
and
what
would
that
damage
be
to
the
city?
justice
marshall
stop
abortion,
and
abortion
is
murder?
justice
marshall
what
about
the
austin
case
and
the
city
of
boston
back
in
1971.
they
said
that
door
to
door
picketing
was
all
right,
door
to
door
leafleting
was
all
right.
justice
marshall
and
you
would
draw
a
line
between
leafleting
and
picketing.
justice
marshall
i
still
have
not
gotten
your
answer.
justice
marshall
and
the
difference
between
leafleting
and
picketing
is
what
from
a
constitutional
standpoint?
justice
marshall
they
both
disturb,
do
they
not?
justice
marshall
you
are
disturbing,
are
you
not?
justice
marshall
is
that
not
what
you
are
against,
disturbing
the
resident?
justice
marshall
it
is
less
disturbing
then?
justice
marshall
why
not
picket
him
at
his
clinic?
you
can
go
up
to
appleton
or
into
milwaukee
and
picket
him
at
his
clinic.
justice
marshall
have
you
ever
checked
on
how
many
times
thornhill
has
been
cited?
justice
marshall
is
there
anything
to
stop
you
from
picketing
his
office?
no.
justice
marshall
so
he
is
right.
