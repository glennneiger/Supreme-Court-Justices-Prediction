mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
this
court
today
is
an
attempted
appeal
from
an
order
affirming
a
preliminary
injunction.
there
is
no
finality,
no
ultimate
determination
on
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
issue,
and
therefore
no
appeal
jurisdiction.
in
light
of
the
preliminary
nature
of
the
case,
this
case
may
well
be
more
appropriately
handled
by
way
of
summary
affirmance
rather
than
a
comprehensive
review
of
the
town's
claims,
claims
which
we
contend
lack
support
in
either
the
record
nor
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
town's
case
rests
fundamentally
upon
a
challenge
of
two
basic
premises
of
first
amendment
law.
that
streets
are
quintessential
public
fora;
and
that
picketing,
a
legitimate
peaceful
forum
of
first
amendment
expression
is
to
be
permitted
in
such
public
fora
areas.
the
district
court,
we
contend
and
we
believe,
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
determining
that
the
picketers
were
likely
to
prevail
on
the
merits
of
their
first
amendment
claims.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
the
district
court's
opinion
indicated
that
based
upon
the
facts
that
are
currently
in
the
record
that
there
were
sufficient
facts
to
grant
the
preliminary
injunction
and
in
fact
to
grant
a
final
injunction.
we
believe
that
this
is
in
fact
an
appropriate
determination.
because
based
upon
the
normal
assumptions
that
are
normally
made
about
streets,
that
they
are
normally
public
fora,
and
also
based
upon
the
normal
conclusion
that
picketing
is
a
legitimate
form
of
expression,
just
based
upon
the
facts
as
developed
there,
that
there
would
be
a
sufficient
record
to
make
that
determination.
however,
if
other
facts
are
sought
to
be
introduced,
such
as
for
example,
the
question
of
whether
one
must
move
or
remain
stationary
to
constitute
picketing
in
the
town
of
brookfield,
perhaps
it
may
be
necessary
to
go
back
for
a
further
determination.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
that
is
correct.
and
if
that
be
the
case,
then
it
would
seem
that
this
court
may
well
wish
to
go
ahead
with
a
final
decision
on
the
merits.
however,
we
would
point
out
that
there
are
a
number
of
facts
that
the
town
has
asserted
in
its
brief,
such
as
the
lack
of
past
use
of
the
streets
of
the
town
of
brookfield
for
picketing,
which
are
not
currently
in
the
record.
so
if
this
court
wishes
to
rely
on
such
facts,
it
may
be
necessary
for
a
further
determination.
but
based
upon
the
facts
now
in
the
record,
there
is
in
fact
evidence
sufficient
to
support
a
preliminary
injunction
in
favor
of
the
picketers
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
i
am
not
certain
of
that
fact,
because
i
am
not
certain
of
that
point.
normally,
a
preliminary
injunction
is
considered
a
non-final
order.
and
secondly,
there
has
not
been
a
square
holding
on
the
constitutional
issue
as
of
yet.
because
all
that
we
have
at
this
point
is
a
preliminary
injunction.
a
final
injunction
was
never
issued.
the
town
could
have
simply
allowed
a
final
injunction
to
be
issued,
in
which
case
there
would
be
no
problem
with
finality
in
this
case.
it
chose
not
to
do
so.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
they
did.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
well,
that
is
the
way
that
the
picketers
have
to
construe
the
status
of
the
case
at
this
point.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
that
is
what
i
heard.
so
that
is
something
that
is
mr.
fuhrman's
decision
to
make,
and
not
the
decision
of
the
picketers,
since
we
did
not
request
a
trial.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
yes,
it
would
be
reviewed
on
the
basis
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
in
such
a
situation.
however,
there
is
a
question
of
whether
there
is
a
square
holding
on
the
constitutional
point.
because
the
lower
court
judge
utilized
the
normal
standard
that
is
used
in
the
seventh
circuit,
which
is
the
standard
of
whether
one
is
likely
to
prevail
upon
the
merits.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
that
is
correct.
we
were
speaking
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
oh,
certainly.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
that
is
correct.
and
in
fact,
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
granting
the
preliminary
injunction
in
this
case.
when
we
turn
to
the
substance
of
the
case
and
the
merits
of
the
case
on
the
free
speech
issue--
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
--the
attack
is
more
in
line
of
a
facial
attack,
in
that
what
the
picketers
are
challenging
is
the
application
of
the
ordinance
to
picketers
in
general
and
into
activity
that
they
would
wish
to
engage
in.
so
it
basically
is
a
facial
challenge.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
if
it
is
a
facial
attack,
there
the
question
that
this
court
would
have
to
determine
is
whether
the
ordinance
could
appropriately
be
subject
to
a
limiting
construction.
in
this
case,
the
town
in
its
brief
indicated
that
limiting
constructions
might
or
might
not
be
possible,
but
that
the
town
wished
to
forbid
all
picketing.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
the
overbreadth
doctrine
is
a
point
that
we
have
relied
upon
at
various
points.
it
was
not
the
key
issue
upon
which
the
district
court
granted
its
injunction.
however,
the
overbreadth
doctrine
has
been
raised
both
at
the
district
court
and
at
the
seventh
circuit.
and
in
this
case,
there
may
well
be
that
the
ordinance
sweeps
substantially
overbroadly
with
respect
to
protected
expression.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
yes.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
yes.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
that
type
of
picketing
serves
as
a
background
certainly
that
this
court
can
consider
and
can
consider
in
terms
of
the
motivation
perhaps
of
the
town
in
passing
this
ordinance.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
the
problem
is
that
the
ordinance
forbids
more
than
simply
that.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
we
do
not
believe
that
the
picketers
have
an
absolute
right
to
picket
without
respect
to
considerations.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
yes,
i
do.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
the
picketing
was
directed
at
both
dr.
victoria
and
his
neighbors.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
that
is
what
the
affidavits
show
and
the
record
shows
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
it
was
in
front
of
his
house.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
that
is
correct.
the
question
i
believe
that
justice
stevens
had
was
a
question
as
to
who
the
proper
audience
was.
certainly,
neighbors
going
back
and
forth
would
be
able
to
see
the
signs,
and
obviously
would
be
an
audience.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
we
do
not
claim
a
right
to
harass.
and
in
this
case,
that
is
not
what
was
involved.
because
public
issue
picketing
is
in
many
ways
quite
similar
to
leafleting.
because
what
is
involved
is
the
transmission
of
a
message,
in
this
case
a
message
of
opposition
to
abortion.
picketing
was
a
means
utilized.
however,
what
was
involved
here
was
not
the
type
of
perhaps
signal
that
one
might
have
in
a
labor
picketing
instance,
but
instead
merely
a
use
of
the
signs
and
the
picketing
to
indicate
disapproval.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
well,
it
is
a
legitimate
place,
as
the
picketers
noted
in
their
affidavits,
to
transmit
their
message
both
to
the
doctor
and
also
to
his
neighbors.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
the
reason
why
picketing
may
be
a
particularly
sensible
type
of
procedure
by
which
to
transmit
such
a
message
is
that
a
picket
sign
is
a
sign
that
a
neighbor
or
anyone
going
by
can
look
at
and
notice
what
the
opinions
are
of
the
picketers.
it
is
in
essence
something
like
a
mass
media
that
can
be
done
at
a
minimum
amount
of
expense
to
the
picketers
involved.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
in
this
case.
because
the
picketers'
desire
is
a
desire
simply
to
transmit
their
message
involved,
and
they
wish
to
utilize
picketing
which
has
been
recognized
as
a
legitimate
first
amendment
protected
means
expression.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
it
is
possible
to
picket
at
other
locations.
however,
the
mere
fact
that
one
can
picket
at
another
location
does
not
permit
a
picketing
ban
in
a
certain
location
unless
such
a
ban
is
narrowly
tailored
to
support
specific
interests,
either
in
safety
or
in
residential
privacy.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
certainly,
alternative
channels
can
figure
into
the
analysis.
however,
once
again,
the
key
point
is
is
this
ordinance
which
forbids
all
picketing
flatly
in
the
town
of
brookfield
an
ordinance
which
is
narrowly
tailored
to
support
the
interests
involved.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
turning
first
to
safety,
the
reason
why
it
is
not
narrowly
tailored
to
support
the
safety
interests
is
number
one,
because
the
ordinance
prohibits
only
picketing
but
permits
a
number
of
expensive
and
non-expressive
activities
which
can
have
just
as
severe
an
effect
upon
the
interests
of
free
vehicular
movement
and
free
pedestrian
movement
and
the
like
as
anything
else.
furthermore,
the
ordinance
addresses
the
problem
in
a
way
which
does
not
make
much
sense.
if
the
problem
is
with
the
picketers'
safety
and
with
the
safety
of
the
community
with
concerns
about
traffic,
what
is
done
is
that
the
picketers
are
moved
off
of
a
property
where
perhaps
there
is
less
traffic
and
moved
on
to
bluemound
road,
a
busy
highway.
where
seemingly
if
one
is
concerned
about
safety,
and
traffic,
and
the
like,
that
the
distractions
will
be
greater
than
in
the
residential
neighborhood.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
as
to
privacy,
the
reason--
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
--well,
a
number
of
different
options
are
available
to
the
town.
first,
with
respect
to
the
adverse
effects
of
picketing,
the
town
has
a
number
of
ordinances
currently
in
effect,
ordinances
banning
such
things
as
littering,
obstruction
of
the
streets
and
so
forth,
which
apply
equally
to
expressive
and
non-expressive
activity,
which
could
suitably
apply
to
this
case.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
well,
there
is
a
trespass
ordinance
which
would
apply
to
such
activity
on
the
lawn.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
that
is
correct.
they
could,
if
they
were
on
the
lawn,
under
the
construction
of
the
state
constitution.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
they
would
be
on
the
streets.
and
there,
you
have
the
question
of
whether
such
activity
would
obstruct
the
street.
and
there,
what
one
could
do
perhaps,
and
the
town
has
not
done
this...
the
point
is
that
the
town
has
banned
all
picketing
irrespective
of
numbers...
the
town
could
perhaps
place
some
limitation
on
the
numbers
of
picketers,
some
limitation
on
the
time
at
which
the
picketers
could
be
out
there,
but
it
has
not
done
that.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
we
believe,
and
obviously
this
is
a
legislative
question
which
the
town
would
have
to
address,
and
it
would
present
a
different
constitutional
question.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
let
me
clarify
then
my
statement
of
a
few
minutes
ago.
the
basic
protection
of
picketing
is
something
that
is
constitutionally
protected.
certainly,
numbers
of
picketers
could
be
regulated
to
the
extent
that
numbers
of
picketers
interfere
either
with
free
use
of
the
streets
or
with
the
interests
of
the
town
in
privacy.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
we
would
have
with
respect
to
that
ordinance
the
similar
analysis
that
would
have
to
be
applied.
that
is
does
the
ordinance
restrict
picketing.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
all
right.
my
answer
would
be
that
ten
picketers
would
raise
a
severe
question,
because
there
would
be
a
question
of
whether
a
limitation--
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
--okay.
i
would
say
that
that
would
not
be
constitutional,
because
there
would
not
be
a
significant
enough
impact
upon
public
safety
interests
to
justify
the
ordinance.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
the
question
with
respect
to
whether
the
picketers
would
believe
that
or
not,
i
think
would
largely
be
determined
if
the
town
passed
such
an
ordinance,
would
the
picketers
then
challenge
it
as
an
unreasonable
limitation
on
their
speech.
and
that
is
a
question
for
a
future
case.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
i
would
answer
the
question
this
way.
we
are
serious
about
the
alternatives.
it
is
possible
that
some
of
the
picketers'
activities
might
have
violated
the
constitution
under
a
narrowly
tailored
ordinance.
this
ordinance,
however,
is
not
narrowly
tailored.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
i
would
again
go
back
to
points
that
have
been
emphasized
with
respect
to
the
entire
discussion
of
this
case.
what
is
not
involved
here
is
an
enforcement
action
on
picketing
which
took
place
after
the
ordinance
was
passed.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
that
is
right.
if
our
activity
is
not
protected,
then
it
becomes
an
overbreadth
challenge.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
that
is
perhaps
a
question
that
would
then
have
to
be
determined
at
trial.
there
might
have
to
be
additional
facts
and
so
forth
put
out
as
to
the
enforcement
policies
of
the
town,
which
might
need
to
be
dealt
with
at
that
point.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
no,
but--
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
--overbreadth
is--
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
--right.
overbreadth
is
basically
a
question
of
applying
the
sweep
of
the
statute,
and
in
essence
determining
that
the
statute
can
apply
very
clearly
to
protected
activity.
and
that
is
apparent
with
respect
to
this
ordinance
which
bans
all
residential
picketing
in
a
neighborhood
without
any
concerns.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
i
believe
that
the
thornhill
case,
which
overbreadth
was
first
utilized,
was
a
picketing
case.
so
picketing
cases
are
subject
to
overbreadth
analysis.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
i
have
not
checked
out
how
many
times,
but
i
believe
with
some
degree
of
frequency
in
my
reading
of
this
court's
first
amendment
cases
in
preparation
here.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
privacy
of
homes
is
a
protectable
interest.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
in
applying
such
an
analysis,
what
has
to
be
determined
is
what
precisely
is
the
character
of
the
privacy
interest.
for
example,
in
the
keith
case,
this
court
seemed
to
indicate
that
there
were
questions
with
respect
to
the
application
of--
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
--excuse
me.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
the
residential
privacy
interests
can
extend
to
some
extent
to
cover
interests
in
tranquillity
and
quiet.
a
noise
ordinance,
for
example,
is
a
proper
means
to
address
that
interest.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
the
abuses
that
go
with
certain
picketing
could
be
regulated.
however,
an
inherent
proscription
of
all
picketing--
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
--what
we
have
in
essence
is
a
balance
in
such
a
situation.
picketing
may
have
some
impact
upon
residential
privacy
interests.
however,
in
looking
at
that
analysis,
it
is
important
to
remember
that
normally,
as
in
the
keith
case,
the
interest
in
residential
privacy
does
not
extend
to
forbid
activity
taking
place
on
a
public
forum
property.
second,
it
is
important
to
realize--
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
--the
court
has
not
applied
the
analysis
of
residential
privacy
to
forbid
activity
in
a
public
forum
of
the
picketing
nature.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
the
closest
that
this
court
has
come
to
that
situation
was
the
carey
case.
and
in
the
carey
case--
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
--well,
in
the
carey
case--
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
--granted,
you
are
absolutely
correct.
however,
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
the
carey
case
in
footnote
that
this
court
indicated
that
its
justification
and
the
reason
for
its
analysis
in
the
carey
case
was
the
presence
of
a
public
forum
there.
and
so
it
would
appear
that
public
forum
analysis
does
appropriately
apply
to
residential
streets,
which
are
not
significantly
different
in
any
major
way
from
the
streets
and
sidewalks
in
other
particular
areas.
furthermore,
getting
back
to
the
residential
privacy
interests,
it
is
important
to
remember--
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
--i
believe
that
it
could
go
on
for
a
substantial
period
of
time,
yes.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
yes,
i
think
it
could.
however,
that
is
an
issue
that
again
is
not
precisely
before
the
court.
because
what
we
have
here
is
an
absolute
flat
ban
on
all
residential
picketing
irrespective
of
how
long
it
extends.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
we
do
not
believe
that...
to
a
certain
extent,
there
will
always
be
a
degree
of
privacy
invasion.
but
the
problem
is
that
what
has
to
be
weighed
in
the
balance
is
this
privacy
invasion,
whatever
it
may
be,
vis-a-vis
the
important
interests
of
the
picketers
in
the
first
amendment
expression.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
what
is
distinctive
about
picketing
activity
is
that
by
use
of
signs
and
by
use
of
perhaps
a
limited
degree
of
movement
that
it
creates
a
place
where
people
can
determine
and
people
can
see
a
message
that
is
broadcast
by
way
of
signs.
and
there
is
a
question
that
perhaps
could
be
turned
the
other
way
with
respect
to
that,
what
is
the
significant
difference
between
picketing
and
marching.
if
marching
is
to
be
prohibited,
what
is
there
about
picketing
that
makes
it
so
substantially
different
that
there
is
a
more
extensive
need
to
regulate
such
activity.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
perhaps
so,
perhaps
so.
but
the
essential
question
though
that
has
to
be
determined
when
one
deals
with
the
interest
in
residential
privacy
is
that
this
interest
is
not
an
interest
in
restricting
content.
there
mere
emotional
impact
that
one
may
receive
from
the
content
of
speech
is
not
relevant.
that
i
believe
is
the
message
of
the
boose
case.
what
is
involved
here
and
what
is
critical
to
remember
is
that
this
ordinance
would
prohibit
picketing
activity
where
it
were
friendly
or
unfriendly.
for
example,
one
under
this
ordinance
could
go
back
and
forth
in
front
of
dr.
victoria's
house
indicating
that
dr.
victoria
adhered
to
the
finest
standards
of
the
medical
profession.
if
one
were
to
do
that,
under
this
ordinance,
it
would
be
prohibited,
under
the
definition
that
the
town
has
utilized.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
he
might,
he
might,
but
he
could
also
report
them
to
the
police.
anything
is
possible
under
this
ordinance.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
the
key
point
here
though
is
that
the
ordinance
sweeps
so
broadly
that
it
prohibits
all
of
these
types
of
activity.
and
furthermore,
the
presence
of
the
interest
is
residential
privacy
is
an
interest
which
must
be
considered
without
respect
to
the
content
of
speech.
if
the
town's
real
interest
is
in
prevention
of
embarrassment
to
dr.
victoria,
then
such
an
interest
should
be
appropriately
dealt
with
in
other
fashions.
but
the
first
amendment
does
not
seem
to
protect
an
interest
in
avoiding
the
embarrassment
or
other
emotional
harm
which
may
result
from
this
type
of
activity
or
from
other
types
of
content
based
activity.
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
however--
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
--the
town's
ordinance
though--
mr.
steven
frederick
mcdowell
--no.
