justice
stevens
that
argument
might
cut
two
ways.
because
if
there
are
no
sidewalks,
i
presume
that
when
someone
has
to
go
for
a
walk,
that
person
must
walk
on
the
street,
so
drivers
should
realize.
justice
stevens
they
encourage
trespassing
in
brookfield.
justice
stevens
but
is
it
not
normal
that
in
a
lot
of
neighborhoods
like
that
that
you
do
in
fact
walk
along
the
edge
of
the
road,
do
you
not?
justice
stevens
so
i
would
think
that
the
drivers
would
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
is
not
a
heavily
trafficked
area,
i
am
sure,
and
they
would
know
that
you
have
to
drive
rather
carefully.
what
is
the
speed
limit,
about
fifteen
miles
an
hour?
justice
stevens
twenty
miles
an
hour.
so
it
is
not
high
traffic
and
high
speed
driving.
justice
stevens
that
sounds
like
the
ordinance
is
enacted
for
the
protection
of
the
picketer.
justice
stevens
did
they
not
ask
for
a
trial?
i
thought
that
they
asked
for
a
trial.
justice
stevens
so
they
obviously
are
not
satisfied
with
the
record.
justice
stevens
i
must
confess
that
i
am
a
little
puzzled.
your
complaint
suggests
that
you
are
concerned
about
your
client's
own
right
to
picket.
justice
stevens
because
they
have
been
threatened
with
arrest.
but
the
district
court
found
what
kind
of
picketing
that
they
had
engaged
in
the
past,
namely
eleven
to
forty
people,
and
there
were
some
unfortunate
remarks
and
one
thing
or
another
of
that
kind.
should
we
ask
the
question
whether
that
particular
type
of
picketing
is
constitutionally
protected?
justice
stevens
what
if
we
were
to
assume
that
that
is
all
that
it
really
prohibits,
and
that
is
all
that
you
really
care
about,
because
you
want
to
engage
in
exactly
what
you
have
done
before,
and
then
focus
on
that
issue
instead
of
all
of
these
hypothetical
things
like
leafleting.
would
you
say
that
you
could
picket
with
forty
persons
out
in
front
all
day
long
seven
days
a
week
in
front
of
this
house?
justice
stevens
well,
first
answer
my
question,
would
you.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
picketing
that
the
district
court
found
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
you
do.
forty
persons
seven
days
a
week
right
straight
through.
and
if
that
is
true
and
if
we
are
focusing
on
this
picketing,
what
was
the
audience
at
which
this
picketing
was
directed?
justice
stevens
i
see,
thank
you.
justice
stevens
let
me
interrupt
you.
you
told
me
a
minute
ago
that
this
picketing
of
forty
persons
all
day
long
was
constitutionally
protected.
how
could
they
put
a
limit
on,
you
mean
no
more
than
fifty
would
be
the
limit,
or
could
they
put
a
limit
on
no
more
than
one
or
two?
justice
stevens
it
is
not
a
legislative
question.
you
are
telling
us
what
they
could
constitutionally
do,
that
they
constitutionally
could
do
these
alternative
things,
all
of
which
are
different
from
what
you
a
few
minutes
ago
told
me
that
they
could
not
constitutionally
do.
justice
stevens
well,
specifically,
could
they
pass
an
ordinance
saying
that
you
may
not
picket
with
more
than
ten
persons
in
front
of
a
house
for
more
than
eight
hours
a
day?
justice
stevens
i
understand
the
analysis.
i
am
curious
to
know
what
your
answer
is.
justice
stevens
i
understand
that
there
is
a
severe
question,
but
what
is
the
answer
to
it?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
you
gave
me
the
same
answer
that
you
did
before,
the
picketing
that
you
engaged
in,
you
think
was
constitutionally
protected.
and
therefore,
these
alternatives
about
changing
numbers
or
hours
are
purely
just
argument.
you
do
not
really
believe
that.
justice
stevens
the
doctor
would
probably
invite
them
in
for
a
cup
of
coffee.
