justice
scalia
mr.
fuhrman,
can
i
ask
whether
this
ordinance
would
prohibit
someone
picketing
generally,
that
is
suppose
a
picket
was
not
stationed
in
front
of
this
doctor's
house,
but
would
a
group
of
people
be
able
to
parade
through
the
neighborhood
carrying
signs
and
just
leave?
justice
scalia
what
does
picketing
consist
of
under
the
ordinance?
justice
scalia
and
that
means
that
you
have
to
be
concentrating
on
one
dwelling?
justice
scalia
if
you
were
just
walking
through
the
neighborhood,
that
would
not
qualify?
justice
scalia
is
the
doctor's
clinic
in
brookfield
or
is
it
elsewhere?
justice
scalia
here
you
are
not
complaining
about
that?
justice
scalia
you
are
still
relying
on
the
threat
to
public
safety?
justice
scalia
although
you
just
told
me
that
there
would
be
no
problem
if
the
picketers
kept
moving
throughout
the
whole
neighborhood,
i
mean
it
is
less
of
a
threat
if
it
occurs
in
the
whole
neighborhood
than
if
it
occurs
in
front
of
one
house?
justice
scalia
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
do
not
find
that
self-evident.
i
think
that
it
surely
depends
on
how
people
are
walking
and
what
they
are
doing.
and
you
could
be
walking
the
same
way
throughout
the
whole
neighborhood,
two
abreast
or
back
and
forth
or
whatever.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
are
focusing
on
the
fact
that
it
is
in
front
of
one
house,
that
it
must
have
something
to
do
with
matters
other
than
safety.
well,
your
record
certainly
contains
instances
of
interference,
does
it
not?
justice
scalia
one
man's
cliche
is
another
man's
fundamental
principle.
be
careful
here.
justice
scalia
billboards
are
forbidden
on
some
of
them,
are
they
not?
justice
scalia
billboards
are
forbidden
on
some
of
them,
are
they
not?
justice
scalia
why
do
you
not
talk
about
that.
i
really
think
a
whole
lot
of
us
want
to
hear
about
this.
justice
scalia
you
are
not
relying
on
the
overbreadth
doctrine
then,
i
take
it?
justice
scalia
if
you
can
only
conceive
of
one
instance
in
which
it
is
okay
and
only
one,
one
might
suspect
that
it
is
overbroad.
justice
scalia
i
would
think
so.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
mean
directed
at,
was
it
in
front
of
the
neighbors'
houses
or
in
front
of
his
house?
justice
scalia
well,
that
is
generally
referred
to
as
picketing
him,
not
picketing
his
neighbors.
justice
scalia
mr.
mcdowell,
you
mentioned
a
couple
of
basic
principles
of
first
amendment
law
when
you
started
off.
on
another
one,
and
we
just
issued
an
opinion
today
that
averts
to
it
indirectly,
is
that
picketing
is
different
from
other
first
amendment
activities.
it
can
be
intimidating.
it
is
different
from
leafleting,
and
it
is
different
from
pure
speech.
as
far
as
the
merely
informative
content
of
letting
the
neighbors
know
that
this
man
is
an
abortionist
and
that
you
disapprove
of
it,
as
far
as
that
is
concerned,
you
would
leaflet,
you
could
slip
information
under
the
doors
of
the
neighbors,
and
you
could
march
around
the
whole
neighborhood
with
a
sign,
as
counsel
for
the
city
says
is
permissible
under
this
ordinance.
but
you
do
not
want
to
do
that.
you
want
to
essentially
hassle
this
doctor,
to
put
it
in
the
vernacular.
you
want
to
be
in
front
of
his
house
and
bring
home
to
him
your
displeasure
with
him
in,
maybe
intimidating
is
not
the
word,
but
an
annoying
fashion
essentially.
is
that
not
what
is
going
on,
is
there
any
other
reason
why
you
have
to
picket
his
house?
justice
scalia
when
you
picket
a
store,
that
is
a
logical
place
to
do
that,
because
you
are
sending
your
message
to
the
customers
of
that
store
or
a
business.
or
you
are
picketing
a
plant
that
is
on
strike.
you
are
sending
the
message
to
the
other
workers
who
might
want
to
come
in.
to
whom
are
you
sending
the
message
here,
that
they
could
not
get
it
anywhere
else,
why
is
this
a
logical
place
to
get
this
message
across
to
anyone
except
the
doctor
whose
privacy
you
are
invading?
justice
scalia
you
can
get
it
to
his
neighbors
very
easily.
his
neighbors
do
not
congregate
in
front
of
his
house.
justice
scalia
you
can
do
that
walking
around
the
neighborhood.
in
fact,
it
would
be
better.
you
would
not
have
to
rely
on
the
neighbors
happening
to
come
out
by
the
house.
you
do
not
want
to
do
that.
you
want
to
stand
right
in
front
of
his
house.
you
want
to
stick
your
thumb
in
his
eye
essentially.
is
that
not
what
it
is
about,
the
annoying
nature
of
picketing?
justice
scalia
we
could
never
decide
an
overbreadth
case
if
we
had
to
do
that,
to
go
back
to
see
exactly
how
the
statute
would
be
applied
in
these
situations.
that
is
not
how
we
do
overbreadth.
justice
scalia
if
it
is
overbroad,
i
is
overbroad,
is
it
not?
justice
scalia
i
do
not
understand
how
you
can
say
that
the
length
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
i
mean
either
it
invades
the
privacy
or
it
does
not
invade
the
privacy.
does
it
not
invade
the
privacy
if
it
only
happens
one
hour
a
day?
that
means
that
it
is
an
one
hour's
invasion.
i
mean
some
activities
you
can
say
if
they
are
at
a
lower
volume,
you
can
say
that
they
do
not
annoy
anybody.
so
a
difference
in
degree
can
make
a
difference
in
kind.
it
is
no
longer
an
annoying
activity.
but
if
this
is
an
invasion
of
privacy,
it
is
an
invasion
of
privacy
if
it
occurs
one
hour
or
24
hours,
is
it
not?
justice
scalia
right.
now
let
us
talk
about
that.
what
is
it
that
you
can
only
do
by
picketing
that
you
cannot
do
by
some
other
form
of
activity,
handing
out
leaflets
and
parading
around,
picketing
in
the
sense
in
which
this
ordinance
uses
the
term,
parading
around
the
whole
neighborhood,
handing
out
leaflets,
picketing
or
doing
whatever
you
want
in
front
of
the
doctor's
offices,
what
is
there
distinctive
about
this,
is
there
anything
distinctive
about
this
activity
except
the
invasion
of
this
man's
privacy?
justice
scalia
i
suggest
that
if
you
have
a
parade
in
your
neighborhood
and
then
have
a
picket
at
your
house,
that
you
will
see
the
difference.
justice
scalia
if
they
liked
him
that
much,
of
course,
they
would
go
away
if
he
asked
them,
i
am
sure.
i
mean
he
would
open
the
door
and
say,
gee,
i
really
like
that,
but
you
fellows
are
invading
my
privacy.
the
best
to
do
if
you
really
like
me
is
to
be
gone.
justice
scalia
the
town
is
willing
to
let
you
march
around
dr.
victoria's
neighborhood
with
a
sign
saying
dr.
victoria
is
an
abortionist
or
whatever
harsher
language
that
you
want
to
use.
they
are
not
worried
about
protecting
him
from
criticism.
they
are
willing
to
let
you
do
that.
justice
scalia
they
just
do
not
want
you
to
annoy
him
in
his
home.
