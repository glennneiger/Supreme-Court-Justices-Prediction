chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
now
in
no.
87-168,
russell
frisby
v.
sandra
c.
schultz
and
robert
c.
braun.
mr.
fuhrman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
far
away
is
the
nearest
commercial
area
on
bluemound
road
from
this
residence?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
green
river
ordinance
cases,
murdock
v.
pennsylvania,
and
struthers,
those
are
pretty
much
what
justice
o'connor
is
talking
about,
too,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fuhrman.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
mcdowell.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
district
court
or
court
of
appeals,
either
one,
mr.
mcdowell,
indicate
that
they
thought
more
facts
were
necessary
in
order
for
them
to
reach
a
conclusion
on
the
constitutional
issue?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
problem
here
is
not
finality
at
all,
i
do
not
think,
under
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
an
order
granting
a
preliminary
injunction
is
appealable.
the
only
question
is
what
standard
of
review
do
you
use
in
judging
whether
or
not
the
preliminary
injunction
was
correctly
granted.
everybody
concedes
that
there
was
at
least
a
preliminary
injunction.
that
is
appealable
to
the
seventh
circuit,
and
we
have
jurisdiction
to
review
a
case
that
is
in
the
seventh
circuit.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
think
that
any
court
familiar
with
our
cases
might
be
more
likely
to
uphold
a
ban
on
residential
picketing
if
there
was
an
opportunity
to
picket
the
individual
that
they
desire
to
bring
the
message
home
to
somewhere
else.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
so
much
the
picketers.
you
are
giving
answers
saying
that
although
the
town
cannot
do
what
it
has
done,
that
it
could
do
these
other
things.
but
then
that
seems
inconsistent
with
the
answer
that
you
think
that
the
constitution
protects
the
way
that
you
actually
picketed
here,
which
would
be
prohibited
by
some
of
the
alternatives
that
you
propose.
so
the
question
is
how
serious
you
are
about
the
alternatives.
chief
justice
rehnquist
have
we
ever
applied
overbreadth
to
an
ordinance
or
a
statute
dealing
just
with
picketing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcdowell.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-168,
frisby
against
schultz
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
