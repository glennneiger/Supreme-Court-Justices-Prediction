did
it
say
prohibit;
it
just
said
regulate,
did
it
not?
justice
white
well,
never
mind,
maybe
i
have
it
wrong.
justice
white
so
if
you
had
some
people
marching
up
and
down
these
streets
saying
vote
for
so
and
so
for
sheriff,
that
would
be
banned,
too?
justice
white
do
the
findings
of
fact
indicate
that
there
is
a
commercial
area
or
business
area
in
which
picketing
can
take
place,
was
that
a
stipulation
or
a
finding?
justice
white
let
us
assume
that
he
was
in
a
black
neighborhood
and
he
walked
up
and
down
a
whole
block
and
did
not
concentrate
on
one
house,
is
that
picketing?
justice
white
well,
he
is
concentrating
on
all
of
the
houses
there,
all
of
the
houses.
justice
white
and
that
is
the
interest
that
carey
spoke
about,
carey
v.
brown.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
i
suppose
that
you
suggest
a
bright
line,
that
any
street
that
could
be
classified
as
a
residential
street
could
be
subject
to
an
ordinance
like
this?
justice
white
if
the
focus
of
the
ordinance
is
an
individual
home,
what
difference
would
it
make
what
kind
of
street
it
is,
as
long
as
the
picketing
is
aimed
at
one
home
on
a
particular
street,
as
the
invasion
of
privacy
is
just
as
great?
justice
white
it
is
going
to
take
a
lot
of
litigation
to
litigate
every
street
in
the
country
to
figure
out
whether
they
are
public
fora
or
not.
justice
white
but
the
town
says
that
it
does
not
have
anything
else
to
offer.
justice
white
well,
if
the
town
wants
the
issue
decided
on
the
present
record,
does
that
make
it
a
final
judgment?
justice
white
you
were
just
talking
about
appellate
jurisdiction,
were
you
not,
not
certiorari
jurisdiction?
justice
white
so
if
you
are
talking
about
jurisdiction,
we
can
always
just
grant
cert.--
justice
white
--but
that
would
still
leave
the
standard
of
review
that
the
chief
justice
was
talking
about.
justice
white
suppose
that
we
thought
that
as
applied
to
the
picketing
that
actually
had
taken
place
and
presumably
would
take
place
again,
that
the
ordinance
was
quite
constitutional,
what
if
we
thought
that.
should
we
not
then
just
sustain
the
ordinance,
or
what
else
do
you
have
to
offer?
justice
white
i
know.
but
if
this
is
a
facial
attack,
and
suppose
we
say
that
as
applied
to
this
picketing
as
applied
by
the
district
court,
that
this
ordinance
is
quite
constitutional.
now
is
not
your
only
rejoinder
then,
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
it
is
overbroad?
justice
white
and
then
what
do
we
have
to
do,
do
we
have
to
imagine
the
reach
of
the
ordinance.
it
may
not
be
substantially
overbroad.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be.
but
to
do
that,
we
should
just
reverse,
we
should
reverse
the
court
of
appeals?
