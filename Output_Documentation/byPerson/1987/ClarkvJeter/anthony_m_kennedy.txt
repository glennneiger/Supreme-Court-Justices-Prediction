justice
kennedy
was
that
a
case
involving
the
distribution
of
funds,
where
the
claimant
was
asking
for
funds?
justice
kennedy
but
what
was
involved
were
funds,
part
of
which
were
federal.
justice
kennedy
and
that
seems
to
me
different
from
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
was
asking,
because
this
is
a
case
in
which
you
are
saying
simply
that
a
state
statute
on
a
procedural
matter
determining
when
an
action
can
be
brought
under
state
substantive
law
is
void
because
of
a
spending
prohibition.
so
i
think
rosato
is
quite
distinguishable
as
are
the
other
cases
you
have
mentioned
in
your
brief.
justice
kennedy
that
was
not
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
though.
justice
kennedy
but
that's
what
they
are...
how
do
they
get
the
courts
to
direct
it?
