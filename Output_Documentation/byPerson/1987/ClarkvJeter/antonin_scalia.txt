justice
scalia
can
that
be
opposed
by
the
child?
justice
scalia
yes.
well,
i
mean
there
is
no
problem
if
nobody
is
worried
about
the
paternity.
if
the
child
wants
to
be
declared
a
child
of
the
father
and
the
father
wants
it,
i
don't
see
why
pennsylvania
would
have
any
concern.
justice
scalia
it
can...
i
see.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
what
kind
of
a
case
is
that
now?
the
father--
justice
scalia
are
there
any
cases
to
come
down
of
what
interests
me
in
particular,
is
there
any
situation
in
which
a
living
individual
can
be
held
by
a
court
to
have
fathered
an
illegitimate
child
without
encountering
this
statute
of
limitation?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
right,
right.
justice
scalia
it
can?
how
does
that...
the
father
is
denying
paternity.
justice
scalia
and
you
say
you
can
get
around
this?
there
is
a
situation
where
this
statute
would
not
apply.
justice
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
but
he
is
not
admitting,
well,
let's
see.
he
is
willing
to
admit
illegitimacy.
he
is
willing
to
admit
that
he
has
fathered
illegitimate
children.
no,
he's--
justice
scalia
well,
i
am
looking
for...
see,
what
i
think
may
underlie
the
pennsylvania
statute
is
the
severe
personal,
legal,
social
consequences
of
a
person
being
judged
by
the
court
to
be
the
father
of
illegitimate
children.
now,
is
there
any
situation
in
pennsylvania
where
that
can
occur
without
encountering
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations?
i
think
pennsylvania
might
say
this
is
a
serious
thing.
we
want
the
proof
to
be
fresh.
we
want
to
be
sure
that
the
individual
who
is
judged
to
be
the
father
of
illegitimate
children
has
a
good
chance
to
prove
that
that's
not
true,
and
we
think
the
evidence
gets
too
stale
for
that
purpose,
at
least,
after
six
years.
now,
is
there
any
situation...
in
your
brief
the
only
thing
i
see
is
after
death
of
the
putative
father,
the
child
can
claim
to
be
an
heir,
and
short
of
have
the
individual
declared
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
after
he's
dead
which--
justice
scalia
--yes,
but
also
he
can't
be
personally
hurt
as
much,
or
personally
vilified
as
much.
justice
scalia
your
answer
to
my
question
is
no
then,
you
don't
know
of
any.
justice
scalia
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
justice
scalia
you
sort
of
abbreviated
that
argument.
i
gather
your
contention
is
that
even
if
this
pennsylvania
rule
is
not
in
compliance
with
the
federal
statute,
all
that
means
is
that
pennsylvania
is
not
in
compliance,
and
the
federal
government,
if
it
wishes,
wit
hold
funds
from
pennsylvania;
not
that
the
pennsylvania
law
is
automatically
amended
to
comply
with
the
federal
state.
justice
scalia
because
pennsylvania
is
entitled
not
to
comply
with
the
federal
statute
if
it
doesn't
want
to
so
long
as
it
understands
that
it
doesn't
get
the
money.
justice
scalia
okay.
that's
all
very
nice,
but
you
tell
me
how
someone
in
the
position
of
jeter
is
going
to
be
able
to
require
either
the
federal
government
to
cut
off
the
money,
or
pennsylvania
to
shape
up
and
follow
the
federal
law.
justice
scalia
i'm
sorry,
the
putative
child
here.
justice
scalia
the
beneficiary
of
a
program
that
was
supposed
to
be
run
in
a
certain
way
by
the
state,
but
it
hasn't
been.
and
the
state
just
comes
in
and
says,
well,
that's
too
bad.
i
guess
the
federal
government
could
have
cut
off
the
money.
justice
scalia
what
would
you
have
suggested
ms.
clark
do
to
get
what
she
considered
justice
in
the
case?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
you
are
telling
us
we
can't
do
anything.
we
can
neither
command
pennsylvania
to...
you
are
saying
we
can't
tell
pennsylvania
to
write
its
law
properly,
right?
justice
scalia
so
what
should
she
have
done
then?
justice
scalia
oh,
you
acknowledge...
i
see.
you
mean
we
can
issue
a
judgment
in
this
case.
what
would
the
judgment
would
be?
justice
scalia
tell
pennsylvania
to
amend
its
statute
subject
to
being
what,
judged
in
default
and
losing
its
federal
funds?
justice
scalia
we
can
issue
that
judgment
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
how
come
the
blood
test
results
changed
here?
as
i
recall
at
an
earlier
stage
it
had
been
determined
that
the
blood
test
established
lack
of
parentage,
and
then
in
the
later
test,
it
was--
justice
scalia
--that
was
connell?
justice
scalia
how
long
ago
was
that
case?
justice
scalia
you
don't,
but
the
effect...
surely,
the
effect
on
the
woman
in
that
case
is
just
as
horrendous
as
the
effect,
if
not
worse,
than
the
effect
upon
the
man
in
a
paternity
case.
you
are
saying
in
those
cases
the
woman,
if
the
father
establishes
non-paternity,
is
in
effect
judged
to
have
committed
adultery
and
had
these
children
as
a
result
of
an
adultery
relationship,
right?
justice
scalia
and
you
say
that
can
be
done
at
anytime
up
until
the--
justice
scalia
--is
there
a
six-year
statute
on
that?
justice
scalia
but
now,
wait.
that
laches
defense,
i
assume
that
means
that
the
father
had
reason
to
know
of
the
illegitimacy
of
the
children,
and
did
nothing
about
it
for
a
lengthy
period,
so
that's
laches.
but
you
acknowledge
that--
justice
scalia
--he
is
disclaiming
paternity
of
the
children.
justice
scalia
okay?
justice
scalia
so
that
child
would
not
be
a
child
of
the
marriage,
right?
justice
scalia
the
child
would
be
an
illegitimate
child.
justice
scalia
correct?
and
you
acknowledge
that
you
can
bring
such
a
suit
beyond
six
years
so
long
as
there
is
no
laches.
but
laches
would
consist
of
knowing
of
the
adultery
well
within
an
earlier
period
and
not
doing
anything
about
it.
you
have
accepted
the
child
as
your
own.
but
that
won't
always
be
the
case.
what
if
the
father
finds
out
about
it
when
the
child
is
16
years
old?
it's
the
first
time
he
has
ever
known
that
this
child
was
not
legitimate.
then
brings
a
suit
saying
i
don't
want
to
support
this
child.
you
acknowledge
that
in
effect
that
suit
goes
forward
and
the
woman
can
be
publicly
convicted
of
having
had
the
child
illegitimately
as
a
result
of
an
adulterous
relationship
16
years
after
the
fact,
and
pennsylvania
doesn't
care
about
that.
