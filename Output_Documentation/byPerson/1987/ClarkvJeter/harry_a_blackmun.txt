justice
blackmun
did
the
court
below
us
speak
on
the
issue
concerning
the
federal
statute?
justice
blackmun
you
are
going
to
go
on
to
your
other
points
in
due
course.
could
i
ask
you
first,
did
you
present
the
statutory
argument
below?
justice
blackmun
is
it
purely
statutory?
aren't
there
supremacy
clause
overtones--
justice
blackmun
--and
other
constitutional
aspects
to
it?
justice
blackmun
why
do
you
say
only
if?
justice
blackmun
why
is
that?
i
don't
follow
that.
justice
blackmun
yes,
but
if
the
statute
is
invalid
on
equal
protection
grounds--
justice
blackmun
--why
is
that
a
barrier?
therefore,
i
don't
follow
your
"only
if"
argument.
justice
blackmun
well,
what
about
the
new
18-year
statute?
justice
blackmun
what
about
the
new
18-year
statute?
justice
blackmun
but
the
legislature
has
adopted
it,
and
hence
isn't
very
concerned
with
it.
justice
blackmun
for
money.
justice
blackmun
money.
justice
blackmun
but
the
state
interests
certainly
didn't
counterbalance
the
money
interest.
