chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
oral
argument
now
in
no.
87-5565,
cherlyn
clark
v.
gene
jeter.
ms.
welling,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
isn't
that
the
way
that
one
would
normally
enforce
the
statute
then?
to
tell
pennsylvania
if
their
laws
aren't
in
compliance,
you
cut
off
the
funds?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
was
no
grant
to
the
state
of
funds
involved
in
bennett.
that
was
a
provision
by
congress
that
said
you
shall
not
attach
any
of
these
benefits.
and
the
state
of
arkansas
says
we
think
there
is
an
implied
exception
to
that.
but
that
wasn't
a
question
of
whether
the
congress
grant
so
much
money
and
says,
to
be
eligible
for
these
you
have
got
to
have
the
following
statutes
in
effect.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--had
he
been
supporting
the
child
up
until
that
time?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
would
have
been
the
first
time
the
question
of
support
was
an
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
welling.
mr.
mcclean,
we
will
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
supremacy
clause
always
applies.
your
argument
is
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
doesn't
conflict
with
any
federal
enactment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcclean.
ms.
welling,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
welling.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
argument
next.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-5565,
clark
against
jeter,
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
