ms.
evalynn
welling
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
cherlyn
clark
filed
a
support
complaint
against
gene
jeter
in
1983,
on
behalf
of
her
daughter,
tiffany,
who
is
10
years
old.
at
that
time
pennsylvania
marital
children
to
pursue
claims
for
support
against
their
parents
at
any
time
up
until
the
were
18
years
old,
and
in
some
instances,
beyond.
however.
pennsylvania
limited
the
right
of
non-marital
children
to
pursue
claims
for
support
against
their
biological
fathers
by
the
requirement
that
paternity
actions
be
commenced
within
six
years
from
the
date
of
the
child's
birth.
in
pennsylvania,
a
support
action
can
be
begun,
but
if
a
putative
father
denies
paternity,
it
cannot
be
continued
until
a
paternity
determination
is
made.
gene
jeter
raised,
as
an
affirmative
defense,
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
in
paternity
actions.
this
was
an
affirmative
defense
to
show
ms.
clark's
support
complaint.
over
the
objections
of
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
was
unconstitutional,
the
trial
court
dismissed
cherlyn
clark's
support
complaint
on
the
basis
that
the
statute
of
limitations
had
passed.
while
cherlyn
clark's
case
was
pending
in
the
appellate
court,
pennsylvania
enacted
an
18-year
statute
of
limitations.
both
the
intermediate
appellate
court
and
the
pennsylvania
highest
court
have
refused
to
apply
the
18-year
statute
of
limitations
to
cherlyn
clark's
complaint.
the
first
issue
before
this
court
today
is
whether
the
federal
child
support
enforcement
amendments
of
1984
require
the
invalidation
of
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
and
require
the
application
of
an
18-year
statute
of
limitation
to
cherlyn
clark's
complaint.
the
1984
child
support
enforcement
amendments
are
part
of
title
4(d)
of
the
social
security
act.
each
state
that
participates
in
the
afdc
program
is
required
to
comply
with
part
4(d).
the
statute
authorizes
specific
funding
penalties
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
child
support
enforcement
amendments.
ms.
evalynn
welling
this
court
specifically,
in
rosato
v.
wyman
in
another
afdc
case,
indicated
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
a
claimant,
who
has
no
normal
route
through
an
administrative
appeal
or
no
impact
on
the
secretary
of
hhs's
decision
to
review
for
compliance
and
penalize
the
state,
that
in
a
situation
like
that
the
federal
courts
have
the
power
to
oversee
the
compliance
of
the
state
with
the
federal
statute.
in
this
case--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--it
was
a
case
that
involved
an
exclusion
from
benefits
of
some
afdc
recipients
on
the
basis
of
a
state
law.
ms.
evalynn
welling
that
is
correct.
ms.
evalynn
welling
perhaps
a
better
response
to
that
would
be
the
case
of
bennett
v.
arkansas,
which
was
very
recently
decided
by
this
case.
that
also
was
a
social
security
act
case
in
which
the
federal
law
provides
that
social
security
benefits
cannot
be
garnished
or
attached.
arkansas
had
a
state
law
which
specifically
said
when
a
person
who
was
receiving
a
social
security
benefit
was
incarcerated
the
state
could
attach
the
social
security
benefits
essentially
to
pay
for
their
upkeep
while
they
were
in
prison.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
the
federal...
what
had
happened
in
that
case
to
bring
it
to
this
court
was
that
the
state
of
arkansas
went
into
a
state
court
and
attached
the
pension
benefits.
and
the
pensioner
raised
as
a
defense
to
that
attachment
the
fact
that
the
state
law
was
in
conflict
with
the
federal
law.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
the
decision
of
the
arkansas
court
allowing
this
to
proceed
was
reversed
on
the
basis
that
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
federal
social
security
act
provision
and
the
state
law
provision.
ms.
evalynn
welling
the
cases
under
the
afdc
statute,
starting
with
king
v.
smith,
have
dealt
specifically
with
the
kind
of
problem
that
we
have
here
where
a
person
who
is
remote
from
the
procedure
which
is
brought
to
bring
a
compliance
action
depends
upon
the
federal
guarantees.
and
in
this
case,
cherlyn
clark's
case
will
go
forward
if
the
federal
law
is
complied
with.
the
compliance
under
the
statute
is
not
required
except
after
three
years.
and
the
compliance
may
or
may
not
deal
with
this
issue.
if
she...
she
has
no
direct
remedy
against
the
hhs
to
ask
them,
or
make
them
bring
a
compliance
case,
and
she
has
a
real
harm
caused
to
her
now
while
her
child
is
growing
up
and
needing
the
support,
and
the
fact
that
the
federal
law
is
not
being
complied
with.
ms.
evalynn
welling
in
the
situation--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--the
retroactivity
question
is
related
to
the
fact
that
pennsylvania
only
allows
support
to
be
granted
from
the
date
that
a
support
complaint
is
filed.
so
that
at
the
outset
it's
clear
that
we're
not
dealing
with
a
child
who
comes
in
now
and
asks
for
support
back
to
the
time
that
they
were
one.
this
kind
of
situation
that
will
be
presented
at
this
point
is
a
situation
where
a
child
files
a
new
complaint,
or
a
child
had
a
complaint
that's
ongoing
at
the
time
that
the
18-year
statute
is
compelled.
ms.
evalynn
welling
in
this
particular
instance
it
is
clear
that
the
language
of
the
statute
comprehended
this
and
included
it.
they
wanted...
they
said
that
the
statute
was
to
apply
to
any
child
at
any
time.
ms.
evalynn
welling
that's
in
the
statute.
ms.
evalynn
welling
no,
in
the
federal
statute.
ms.
evalynn
welling
that's
absolutely
correct.
ms.
evalynn
welling
that
is
the
heart
of
this
argument,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
situation
the
statute
of
limitations
as
contained
in
the
federal
statute,
the
requirement
of
this
18-year
statute
is
framed
in
mandatory
language.
it
is
one
of
the
four
sections
of
666
which
is
required
on
the
states,
but
which
specifically
is
not
included
in
the
number
of
requirements
that
a
state
is
allowed
to
request
a
waiver
from
the
secretary
of
hhs.
so
the
structure
of
the
statute
underlines
the
fact
of
the
mandatory
and
clear
language
of
the
statute
itself.
for
the
statute
to
say
it
requires
the
state
have
in
effect
procedures
which
permit
the
establishment
of
paternity
of
any
child
at
any
time,
the
house
report
that
accompanied
the
bill
in
the
house
talked
about
the
fact
that
there
were
shorter
statutes
of
limitations
in
the
various
jurisdictions.
remember
that
this
congressional
decision
to
pass
this
statute
follows
hard
on
the
heels
of
the
pickett
v.
brown
decision
and
the
mills
v.
habluetzel
decisions
which
had
invalidated
a
one
and
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations.
that
was
in
'82
and
'83.
the
congressional
debate
about
this
was
taking
place
in
'83,
and
specifically
made
part
of
that
is
the
recognition
that
there
are
these
shorter
statutes
of
limitations
out
there.
the
house
report,
talking
about
the
18-year
statute
of
limitations,
says,
"if
a
state's
applicable
statute
of
limitations
does
not
permit
establishment
of
a
child's
paternity
past
the
child's
second,
sixth
or
other
birthday,
it
will
be
impossible
ever
to
establish
support
orders
on
behalf
of
a
child
past
these
ages,
and
therefore
impossible
to
obtain
support
for
them.
"
the
legislative
history
here
is
clear
that
congress
was
thinking
about
children
who
were
already
past
the
statutory
limits
in
their
particular
states.
and
that
it
intended
by
the
broad
comprehensive
mandatory
language
of
666
to
apply
this
18-year
statute
to
any
child.
the
health
and
human
services
comment
to
the
regulations
is
also
helpful
here,
because
it
speaks
specifically
to
this
point.
it
says,
they
are
not
going
to
promulgate
regulations
on
this
because,
"since
it
is
clear
the
case
is
previously
closed
because
of
a
child
age
will
now
have
to
be
reopened.
"
they
found
it
unnecessary
to
promulgate
regulations
on
this
particular
issue.
so
it's
clear
also
from
the
hhs
gloss
on
this
that
everybody
was
thinking
about
the
fact
that
this
would
apply
retroactively
to
children
who
were
already
born
at
the
time
this
statute
was
in
effect,
to
children
who
may
already
have
passed
the
statute
of
limitations
if
it
were
shorter
in
their
individual
jurisdiction.
ms.
evalynn
welling
in
clark
v.
jeter,
they
did
not.
in
paulussen
v.
herion,
which
was
remanded
from
this
court
for
the
specific
purpose
of
determining
the
applicability
of
an
18-year
statute
to
pennsylvania,
which
came
down
right
around
the
time
that
clark
v.
jeter
was
being
decided
in
the
intermediate
court,
the
pennsylvania
intermediate
court
said
only
that
they
viewed
the
federal
child
support
enforcement
amendments
to
be,
18-year--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--yes,
we
presented--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--what
happened
was
that
the
child
support
enforcement
amendments
were
passed
in
'84,
but
they
weren't
implemented
in
pennsylvania
until
'86.
so
they
were
implemented
while
the
appeal
was
pending.
at
the
oral
argument...
they
were
implemented
while
the
appeal
was
pending.
they
didn't
come
into
effect
in
pennsylvania
until
january
of
1986.
ms.
evalynn
welling
oh,
no,
no,
not
at
all.
ms.
evalynn
welling
at
the
time
of
the
oral
argument,
we
asked
for
a
remand,
because
this
was
an
intervening
factor
while
the
litigation
was
going
on,
while
the
appeal
was
going
on,
we
asked
for
a
remand
to
the
trial
court,
which
is
the
normal
procedure
in
pennsylvania,
for
a
decision
on
the
applicability
of
the
18-year
statute
of
limitations.
the
court
denied
that
at
the
same
day
they
decided
the
case
against
us.
they
had
not
allowed
us
to
file
briefs
on
this
issue.
ms.
evalynn
welling
we,
of
course,
raised
this
specific
argument
in
the
motion
for
reargument
in
front
of
the
intermediate
court,
and
again
in
our
request
for
review
by
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
ms.
evalynn
welling
i'm
sorry
to
waste
your
time.
if
this
court
decides
that
the
federal
child
support
enforcement
amendments
do
not
require
the
invalidation
of
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
under
the
child
support
enforcement
amendments,
if
this
court
decides
that
the
child
support
enforcement
amendments
do
not
require
an
18-year
statute
to
be
applied
to
cherlyn
clark's
case
so
that
her
ongoing
support
case
can
now
move
forward,
then
the
next
issue
that
must
be
decided
by
this
court
is
whether
or
not--
--must
we
take
up
the
statutory
issue,
as
you
call
it?
ms.
evalynn
welling
your
honor,
i
think
so,
yes.
ms.
evalynn
welling
precisely.
ms.
evalynn
welling
that
is
precisely
correct.
that
this
statute,
the
pennsylvania
statute
as
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
child
support
enforcement
amendments.
and
only
if
this
court
does
not
reach
that
issue,
then
before
this
court
will
be
the
question
of
the
equal
protection
claim--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--well,
if...
because
of
the
nature
of
cherlyn
clark's
case,
she
has
a
support
complaint
that's
pending
since
1983,
and
she
has
damages
which
are
dating
from
1983.
if
this
court
decides
that
the
child
support
enforcement
amendments
do
not
compel
and
18-year
statute
of
limitations
to
be
applied
to
her
case,
then
she
will
be
without
remedy
for
all
of
the
support
in
her
ongoing
support
case?
ms.
evalynn
welling
because
she
will
be
barred
by
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations.
ms.
evalynn
welling
correct.
ms.
evalynn
welling
maybe
i
should
just
restate
it.
the
six-year
statute
is
clearly
invalid
on
equal
protection
grounds.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
a
classification
based
on--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--yes,
i
understand
your
question.
i
think
that
if
pennsylvania
said
we
will
allow
the
paternity
to
be
decided,
then
pennsylvania
procedure
would
carry
the
rest
of
the
was,
because
once
paternity
had
been
decided
her
support--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--that's
correct.
ms.
evalynn
welling
and
the
equal
protection
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
that
there
has
been
this
differentiation
between
the
rights
accorded
marital
children
as
opposed
to
the
rights
accorded
non-marital
children
in
order
to
establish
support
against
their
parents.
this
court
has
frequently
spoken
of
the
problems
that
the
historic
discrimination
against
illegitimate
children
have
caused
and
the
belief
that
it's
unfair
to
punish
illegitimate
children
for
the
acts
or
the
conduct
of
their
parents.
pennsylvania
has
justified
this
discrimination
solely
in
terms
of
the
desire
to
meet
problems
of
state
proof
and
fraudulent
claims.
in
astemborski
v.
susmarski,
a
case
which
was
remanded
from
this
court
in
order
for
pennsylvania
to
consider
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
in
light
of
the
pickett
and
mills
cases.
in
that
case
pennsylvania...
the
supreme
court
said
very
clearly
that
the
reason
for
this
six-year
statute
of
limitations
is
only
to
prevent
stale
and
fraudulent
claims,
that
it's
only
a
question
of
proof
problems.
nevertheless,
in
pennsylvania,
there
are
numerous
paternity
determinations
which
pennsylvania
allows
now
and
has
allowed
in
the
past
which
permit
paternity
determinations
to
go
on
at
any
time
after
a
child's
birth
without
any
worry
on
pennsylvania's
part
about
whether
or
not
these
present
problems
of
state
proof
or
fraudulent
claims.
for
instance,
if
a
father
wants
to
come
forward
and
have
a
child's
birth
certificate
amended
to
add
his
name,
he
can
bring
an
action
to
do
that.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
the
child
is
17
or
the
child
is
2.
if
he
wants
to
try
to
get
custody
of
a
child
and
he
is--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--by
the
child?
ms.
evalynn
welling
that's
correct,
but
it
can
be
opposed
by
the
mother,
and
that
frequently
happens
actually.
ms.
evalynn
welling
actions
for
custody
in
which
the
mother
has
never
acknowledged
that
this
particular
man
is
the
father
of
the
child,
in
those
case,
again,
paternity
actions
are
permitted
in
pennsylvania
without
any
statute
of
limitations.
actions
to
deny--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--where
a
father
wants
to
sue
for
custody
but
his
paternity
has
not
been
established.
and
so
in
order
to
have
standing
to
sue
for
custody
and
not
be
considered
a
third
party,
he
needs
to
have
a
paternity
determination.
actions
to
deny
paternity,
these
can
go
forward
no
matter
how
old
the
child
is.
for
instance,
in
the
connell
v.
connell
case
that
was
cited
in
our
brief,
a
father
of
a
child
denied
paternity
and
had
a
litigation
of
it
when
the
child
was
12
years
old.
cases
like
this
have
had
a
special--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--he
had
been
married
and
supporting
the
child.
then
the
family
split
up.
he
stopped
supporting
the
child
for
a
number
of
years,
and
then
a
support
action
was
brought.
ms.
evalynn
welling
yes,
i
believe
that's
right.
ms.
evalynn
welling
living
individual--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--can
be
held
to
have
fathered
a
child.
ms.
evalynn
welling
in
an
action
where
the
father
is
denying
paternity--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--and
in
that
situation,
yes.
and
that
has
the
anomalous
result
that--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--right.
ms.
evalynn
welling
right.
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
that
applies
to
a
after
of
marital
children
who
says
that
he
wants
to
deny
that
these
children
are
his
after
a
support
action
is
brought.
and
the
pennsylvania
superior
court--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--no,
he's
saying
this
is
not
my
child
at
all.
this
is
somebody
else's
child.
ms.
evalynn
welling
that's
precisely
right.
even
when
the
father
isn't
able
to
come
forward
and
testify
about
events.
ms.
evalynn
welling
of
course,
his
heirs
are
always
concerned,
and
these
are
always
in
that
context.
i
would
like
to
return
to,
though--
ms.
evalynn
welling
--i
believe
that
the
statute
of
limitations
not
being
applied
to
denial
of
paternity
is
really
the
same
thing;
just
a
mirror
image
of
it.
and
i
would,
if
i
may,
like
to
point
out
an
anomaly
situation
that
that
brings
up,
which
is
that
if
a
father
is
allowed
to
deny
paternity
and
have
a
determination
that
he
is
not
the
father...
because
he
has
been
married
to
the
mother...
past
the
time,
past
six
years,
the
putative
father
who
has
been
married
to
the
mother
may
get
out
of
a
determination
that
he
is
the
father
and
he
is
no
longer
responsible
for
support
for
this
child
because
there
has
been
a
determination,
say
when
the
child
is
12,
that
he
is
not
the
father.
but
now
the
mother
is
in
the
situation
of
not
being
able
to
bring
an
action
against
anybody
else
because
of
this
six-year
statute
of
limitations.
this
court
has
indicated
in
the
pickett
decision
that
the
existence
of
blood
tests
also
further
attenuate
the
concerns
that
a
state
may
have
for
avoiding
stale
and
fraudulent
claims
in
this
context.
and
i
would
only
point
out
that
in
allegheny
county
we
recently
had
in
a
rape
trial
the
first
instance
of
this
genetic
fingerprinting
used
in
a
trial.
the
blood
testing
is
getting
ever
more
sophisticated
and
more
valid,
more
reliable.
and
again
this
takes
away
from
the
claim
of
the
state
that
this
six-year
statute
of
limitations
is
necessary
to
prevent
stale
claims.
this
is
the
third
time
that
this
court
has
heard
argument
on
this
six-year
statute
of
limitations
of...
pennsylvania's
six-year
statute
of
limitations
in
which
equal
protection
was
raised.
and
the
cases
continue
to
point
out
the
kinds
of
reasons
that
people
miss
this
statute,
the
kind
of
reasons
that
make
this
statute
an
extreme
hardship.
cherlyn
clark's
case
is
a
good
example
how
she
was
misled,
how
she
continued
to
believe,
that
she
was
afraid
of
mr.
jeter
for
a
long
time,
then
was
getting
partial
support
payments
from
him.
basically
got
to
the
point
where
she
filed
what
she
thought
was
a
support
complaint,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
just
a
paper
with
the
welfare
department.
and
by
the
time
she
got
it
straightened
around,
she
was
past
the
six
years,
past
the
time
for
filing
her
complaint.
think
about
the
mother
who
takes
care
of
a
child
and
is
independent
and
not
worried
about
support
for
the
child
who
dies
after
the
child
is
six,
and
the
person
who
is
a
substitute
caretaker
has
to
take
over
the
responsibility
of
caring
for
that
child,
or
think
about
another
client
of
mine
who
is
married
to
a
man
and
had
two
children.
they
got
divorced,
and
she
and
he
later
reconciled.
they
had
a
brief
reconciliation.
she
conceived
another
child.
he
came
to
the
hospital
for
the
birth
of
the
child.
he
had
been
paying
support
for
the
older
two
children.
he
continued
to
pay
support
for
awhile,
and
then
he
discontinued.
she
finally
decided
that
enough
was
enough.
she
would
have
to
file
a
support
action.
and
when
she
did,
he
denied
paternity
of
the
non-marital
child,
and
she
was
past
the
statute
of
limitations.
six
years
is
the
age
when
children
also
come
to
the
time
of
going
to
school,
and
having
themselves
to
fill
out
forms
saying
who
their
parents
are.
and
the
cutoff
point
at
six
years
also
brings
to
an
impossible...
coincides
with
this
time.
it's
before
the
child
really
begins
to
worry
about
who
their
father
is
before
they
can
begin
to
very
strongly
say
to
their
mother,
please
bring
this
case.
and
this
cutoff
operates
to
deny
children
a
real
impact
on
the
decision
of
the
mother
not
to
pursue
support
for
whatever
reasons.
for
this
reason,
the
pennsylvania
court's
decision
should
be
reversed.
ms.
evalynn
welling
i
have
no
rebuttal.
thank
you.
