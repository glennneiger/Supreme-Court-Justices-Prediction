justice
white
you
still
have
a
problem
about
retroactivity,
don't
you?
even
if
you
are
right
in
a
way,
you
have
to
say
the
federal
law
intended
a
later
adopted
state
statute
to
be
applied
retroactively.
justice
white
is
that
right?
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
white
well,
pennsylvania
here
said
that
it
wouldn't
apply,
the
18-year
statute
which
has
been
adopted
at
a
certain
time,
to
this
case.
justice
white
who
said
that?
justice
white
in
the
pennsylvania
statute?
justice
white
well,
that's
what
i...
yes,
so
you
do
have
to
interpret
the
federal
law
to
win
on
this
particular
statutory
point.
justice
white
you
have
to
convince
us
that
the
federal
law
forbad
pennsylvania
from
refusing
to
apply
the
18-year
statute
retroactive.
justice
white
and
how
did
they
rule
against
you
without
ruling
on
that
point?
justice
white
so
you
think
they
were
entitled
not
to
rule
on
your
point?
justice
white
well,
they
rejected
it,
didn't
they?
justice
white
because
this
statutory
argument,
and
if
this
had
happened
while
the
petition
to
a
cert
was
pending,
we
very
well
have
remanded
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
a
statutory
argument.
