mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
to
ms.
welling's
retroactivity
argument,
the
issue
must
fall
even
if
the
18-year
statute
of
limitations
would
have
been
held
to
be
retroactive,
or
if
this
court
would
somehow
deem
that
it
should
be
retroactive,
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
clark
v.
jeter
case.
the
reason
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
clark
v.
jeter
case
is
that
the
18-year
statute
was
enacted
two
and
a
half
years
after
clark
v.
jeter,
the
complaint
was
filed.
what's
more,
the
18-year
statute
was
enacted
after
a
final
judgment
had
been
rendered
in
this
case.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
clark
v.
jeter
case,
the
superior
court
pronouncement--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--well,
it
is,
but
the
court
had,
in
july
of
1985,
rendered
its
decision
in
pennsylvania.
that
is
a
final
judgment
which
an
appeal
can
be
lodged.
the
case
was
over
at
that
point.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
well,
i
think
that
that
is
true,
but
the
court
did
not
say
that.
the
court
specifically--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--well,
i
don't
think
the
federal
statute
says
that.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
well,
that's
correct.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
does
not
follow
the
federal
1984
amendments.
i
think
that
it
does.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
no,
i
don't.
i
think
that
it
does
follow
the
federal
directive.
the
reason
why
i
say
that
it
does
is
that
for
19
years
we
have
been
examining
these
cases
involving
children
of
unwedded
parents.
and
the
issue
with
respect
to
any
means
the
difference
between
a
legitimate
child
and
an
illegitimate
child,
not
as
in
this
case
where
there
is
a
specific
narrow
holding
that
clark
v.
jeter
was
finished,
it
was
done.
it
was
a
case
that
has
already
been
put
to
rest.
the
differentiation
isn't
between
case
which
have
been
put
to
rest
and
cases
which
still
can
be
brought.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
that's
correct.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
this
case
as
it
stands,
as
it
is.
the
broad
brush
that
petitioner
wants
to
paint
is
too
extensive.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
well,
we
have
to
go
back
to
what
statute
was
in
effect
at
that
time.
that
is
the
relevant
period
of
time--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
at
the
time
of
the
appellate
court.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
i
think
that
i
should
note
that
if
congress
had
wished
that
these
amendments
raise
cases
which
had
been
put
to
rest,
it
should
have
said
so.
it
didn't
say
so.
it
simply
used
the
modifying
word
"any",
and
to
construe
that
word
to
affect
this
case
would
be
going
too
far.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
interpretation.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
what
happens?
for
instance,
if
the
superior
court
had
determined--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--that's
correct.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
it
is
a
final
judgment
with
respect
to
what
law
applies
to
it--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--was,
the
final
judgment
was
entered.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
yes,
it
was
a
final
judgment
in
july
of
1985.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
that's
correct.
i
think
that
we
have
to
examine
the--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--no,
it
was
a...
the
hearing
was
held
with
respect
to
whether
gene
jeter
was
estopped
from
asserting
the
statute
of
limitations
because
of
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case.
it
was
not
a
judgment
on
the
merits.
there
was
no
adjudication
with
respect
to
paternity,
but
it
was
an
extensive
examination
with
respect
to
those
circumstances
that
surrounded
the
application
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
i
think
that
the
petitioner's
reliance
upon
the
secretary
of
the
health
and
human
services
with
respect
to
the
retroactive
application
of
the
18-year
statute
is
misplaced.
we
have
to
look
to
the
congress,
and
as
i
had
said,
if
the
congress
hasn't
specifically
required
retroactivity,
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
can't
in
its
regulations
adopted
pursuant
to
the
amendments
require
it.
i
should
note
to
the
court
that
of
the
many
procedures
that
were
adopted
in
the
1984
amendments
requiring
compliance,
it
was
only
in
this
one
instance
that
hhs
decided
to
change
the
wording
of
what
the
congress
had
enacted.
for
those
reasons,
i
don't
think
that
the
statute
can
be
applied
retroactively.
we
have
talked
about
the
supremacy
issue
and
whether
the
supremacy
clause
applies
here.
the
reason
why
the
supremacy
clause
does
not
apply
is
that
congress,
by
its
1984
amendments--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--that's
true.
i
would
note
that
if
this
court
would
say
that
pennsylvania
is
not
in
compliance,
the
proper
determination
would
be
to
remand.
as
to
the
equal
protection
arguments--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--okay.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
that's
correct.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
that's
correct.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
jeter
is
my
client.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
i
think
the--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--well,
i
think
it's
incumbent
upon
the
courts
to
direct
that.
i
don't
think
the
remedy
is
within
the
individual
person.
i
agree
with
the
petitioner
in
that
respect.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
well,
if
the
pennsylvania
statute
is
deemed
to
be
not
in
compliance,
pennsylvania
has
to
be
given
an
opportunity,
with
respect
to
the
king
case
and
the
townsend
case,
to
come
into
compliance.
one
might
be
able
to
say
why
hasn't
hhs
cut
of
its
funds.
i
think
that
the
procedure
that
this
court
has
adopted
is
to
give
pennsylvania
an
opportunity
to
comply.
there
has
been
no
determination
as
of
yet
that
they
are
not
in
compliance.
one
has
to
react
to
that
determination.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
she
did
apply
for
certiorari
to
this
court.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
i
have
said
that
that
is
the
situation,
that
is
true.
i
think
that--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--i
believe
i
did
say
that
she
applied
certiorari
to
this
court,
and
that
the
court's
response,
if
it
sees
that
there
is
no
compliance,
is
to
give
pennsylvania
the
opportunity
to
amend
its
statute
with
respect
to
the
18-year
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
well,
the
judgment
would
be
if--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--correct.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
i
think
that
you
can
remand
to
pennsylvania
to
examine
its
statute
to
see
that
if
it
is
retroactive
to
include
ms.
welling's
client.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
that's
correct,
you
could
do
that.
if
the
court
were
to
do
that,
what
you
would
be
focusing
on
is
those
kinds
of
impediments
that
the
court
has
looked
at
in
the
past.
in
the
mills
and
pickett
cases,
the
court
examined
those
kinds
of
impediments
that
were
related
to
the
mother,
the
custodian,
the
guardian,
the
next
friend
not
being
able
to
go
forward.
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
and
see
that
the
woman
in
this
case
was
under
no
such
impediment;
that
the
birth-related
impediments
do
not
exist
at
six
years.
and,
further,
with
respect
to
the
state's
interest
in
avoiding
fraudulent
claims,
pennsylvania
has
specifically
looked
at
cases
such
as
this
one
where
11
years
after
the
birth
of
a
child
the
evidence
is
no
longer
available
for
the
defendant
in
this
case
to
be
able
to
adequately
defend
against
this
claim.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
well,
i
think
that
those
problems
are
prevalent
there
also.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
well,
i
think
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
motivating
factors
behind
why
that
18-year
statute
was
adopted.
that
18-year
statute
was
adopted
to
bring
it
into
compliance
so
that--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--pennsylvania
could
receive
money.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
that's
correct.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
well,
i
don't
think
we
can
compare
the
six-year
statute
against
the
18-year
statute.
the
18-year
statute
isn't
at
issue.
in
comparing...
balancing
interest
between
the
state
and
the
claimant
in
this
case,
i
think
that
pennsylvania
has
opted
for
saying
that
the
statute
does
not
violate
equal
protection.
it
is
their
determination
in
pennsylvania
that
there
is
some
importance
to
avoiding
stale
and
fraudulent
claims.
one
of
the
things
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
the
woman
in
this
case
had
specifically
signed
a
document
with
the
department
of
public
welfare
where
she
did
not
give
up
her
rights
to
lodge
the
claim
herself,
although
she
did
assign
the
right
to
lodge
that
claim
to
the
department
of
public
welfare.
what's
more,
the
department
of
public
welfare...
the
women
that
had
testified
in
this
case
stated
that
the
records
of
the
department
of
public
welfare
were
routinely
purged.
my
client
in
this
case
has
no
ability
to
go
back
some
15
years
ago
to
examine
the
records
in
this
case.
this
woman
in
this
case
had
named
somebody
else
as
the
father
of
this
child
when
the
baby
was
born.
and
it
was
only
until
five
years
later
did
she
recant
and
choose
to
name
my
client.
i
think
that
this
particular
case
bespeaks
the
problems
that
are
associated
with
avoiding
state
and
fraudulent
claims.
this
woman
on
the
stand
had
stated
that
my
client
had
abused
her.
my
colleague,
ms.
welling,
has
misrepresented
to
this
court
that
that
was
the
finding
of
the
court.
if
we
would
examine
the
trial
court's
finding,
we
would
see
that
the
trial
court
merely
stated
that
cherlyn
clark
said
one
thing
and
my
client
said
another.
ms.
welling
had
also
stated
that
there
were
partial
support
payments.
the
court
did
not
find
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
specifically
put
in
quotation
marks
the
term
25
within
a
15-year
period
of
time.
ms.
welling
has
talked
about
the
attenuated
nature
of
blood
tests.
if
we
examine
what
has
occurred
in
recent
past
with
blood
tests,
there
is
much
talk
these
days
regarding
dna
fingerprinting.
what
is
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
the
abo
testing
and
the
hla
testing.
we
don't
have
the
dna
fingerprinting
in
allegheny
county,
although
i'd
stated
in
my
brief
that
i
was
unaware
of
any
state
within
the
united
states
that
uses
dna
fingerprinting.
i
understand
that
washington
is
now
to
some
degree
experimenting
with
it,
but
we
don't
use
it
in
allegheny
county.
we
don't
use
it
in
pennsylvania.
maybe
some
time
down
the
road
we
will
be
at
the
point
where
a
paternity
can
be
an
administrative
hearing,
but
between
the
two
footnotes
to
the
mills
case
where
the
paternity
blood
testing
was
discussed,
those
problems
still
exists.
and
the
problems
are
that
if
there
is
exclusion,
there
is
a
scientific
fact.
if
there
is
a
paternity
index
in
the
absence
of
exclusion,
it's
merely
a
mathematical
probability.
again,
the
problem
continues
to
exist.
the
blood
tests,
as
we
go
from
a
six-year
statute
even
to
an
18-year
statute,
become
more
of
a
problem.
the
reason
why
they
become
more
of
a
problem
is
that
as
the
years
pass
evidence
become
less
and
less
available
to
the
defendant.
in
the
face
of
a
blood
test
result
that
wouldn't
change,
it
becomes
more
compelling
or
more
prejudicial,
if
you
will.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
i
think
you
are
thinking
of
the
connell
case.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
connell
was
cited
in
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
connell
was
1984.
in
the
connell
case,
i'd
like
to
address
the
connell
case
if
i
can.
petitioner
has
stated
that
pennsylvania
exists
and
somehow
treats
illegitimate
children
differently
from
legitimate
children
routinely.
in
the
connell
case,
in
those
other
cases
that
deal
with
married
parents
raising
the
issue
of
paternity,
they
do
so
in
a
circumstance
where
a
woman
would
claim
support
for
the
child,
and
there
would
be
a
mere
answer,
a
denial
of
paternity.
the
question
at
that
point
is
ordering
of
blood
tests.
there
is
no
specific
limitation
on
the
ordering
of
blood
tests
in
pennsylvania.
in
the
connell
case,
what
happened
was
that
two
boys
were
at
issue
initially.
one
was
excluded;
the
other
wasn't.
what
happened
then
was
the
support
case
didn't
go
on.
we
can
only
assume
that
the
parties
reconciled.
some
years
later
the
blood
test
again
was
requested,
and
the
blood
tests
were
not
allowed.
mr.
connell
lost
this
case.
and
in
the
other
cases
that
are
cited
if
we
would
look
at
those,
what
pennsylvania
does,
because
in
the
case
where
we
are
dealing
with
married
people,
you
don't
get
to
the
paternity
statute.
what
pennsylvania
does
is
it
puts--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--that's
correct,
but
i'm
going--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--i
didn't
say
that.
i
was
going
to
get
to
the
point--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--what
was
specifically
stated
in
the
petitioner's
brief
was
that
provided
that
the
putative
father
is
not
barred
by
laches
or
estoppel,
and
in
each
one
of
these
cases
the
father
was
barred
by
laches
or
estoppel
prior
to
the
period
of
time
that
would
have
been
represented
by
the
six-year
statute.
in
the
specific
case,
seven
years
later
when
mr.
connell
came
in
again,
the
court
said,
you
waited
too
long.
and
in
the
uniform...
the
uniform
blood
testing
act
that
pennsylvania
has
adopted,
it
specifically
states
that
blood
testing
should
be
done
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
birth
of
the
child.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
no,
this
is
not
illegitimate...
this
is
between
wedded
parents.
are
you
speaking
with
respect
to
the
child
who
has--
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
--fine.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
correct.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
correct.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
correct.
mr.
craig
a.
mcclean
that's
not
true.
the
cases
that
are
specifically
cited
by
the
petitioner
favor
my
client.
i
mentioned
laches
and
i
mentioned
estoppel.
pennsylvania
specifically
looks
at
instances
where
men
have
been
living
in
a
situation
where
they
are
married,
whether
they
have
known
about
it
or
not
known
about
it,
and
have
supported
the
children
for
a
period
of
time.
what
we
have
to
do
is
we
have
to
look
at
what
is
in
the
nature
of
a
defense
when
the
issue
of
paternity
is
raised.
marriage
certainly
is
the
counterpoint
to...
in
the
illegitimate
situation
between
unwedded
people,
the
access,
non-access,
the
continuing
relationship.
that's
why
in
pennsylvania
what
we
say
is
that
there
is
a
rebuttable
presumption
of
paternity
in
the
case
where
people
are
married.
that's
how
we
treat
it
differently.
but
to
say
that
pennsylvania
does
not
post
any
barrier
to
a
wedded
parent
as
opposed
to
an
unwedded
parent
is
not
true.
so
too
with
respect
to
the
case
where
the
unwedded
father
can
lodge
an
action.
the
case
had
risen
because
the
unwedded
father
not
being
the
custodian,
not
being
the
guardian,
not
being
the
next
friend,
could
not
come
into
the
court
under
the
paternity
statute
and
establish
the
paternity
for
the
ability
to
have
some
kind
of
visitation
rights,
or
to
establish
inheritance
rights.
what
happened
in
the
mengel
case
that
petitioner
raised
was
that
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
gave
the
father
the
rights
to
come
in
under
the
pennsylvania
declaratory
judgment
act.
there
are
no
prohibitions
in
pennsylvania
whatsoever
to
say
that
this
man
has
to
do...
cannot
do
this,
excuse
me.
there
is
no
prohibition
in
pennsylvania
that
the
man
has
to
come
in

excuse

in
pennsylvania,
that
man
must
come
in
within
a
certain
period
of
time.
there
are
no
cases
which
say
to
the
contrary.
i
think
that
we
have
to
pay
strict
attention
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
show
that,
in
this
equal
protection
setting,
the
woman's
rights
are
well
taken
care
of.
and
in
the
face
of
the
defendant's
ability
to
lodge
a
defense,
the
records
are
not
available.
she
named
someone
else
as
the
father
of
the
child.
the
equal
protection
argument
must
fall.
if
the
equal
protection
argument,
if
this
is
found
to
be
unconstitutional,
it
affects
gene
jeter
in
this
case.
because
of
the
18-year
statute
of
limitations,
i
think
what
occurs
is
that
other
children
that
have
not
lodged
a
claim
are
not
estopped
from
coming
to
the
court.
what
happens
is
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
final
judgment
and
the
statute
of
limitations,
as
previously
existed,
has
to
apply.
the
last
argument,
the
due
process
argument,
as
a
matter
of
procedural
due
process
the
ferry
and
martinez
cases
control.
the
state
statute
is
not
wholly
arbitrary
or
irrational.
i
think
that
in
looking
at
the
statute
of
limitations,
one
can't
say
that
pennsylvania
cannot
have
some
statute
of
limitations
at
all.
and
apart
from
that,
the
ability
of
the
child
to
get
into
court
in
pennsylvania
can
be
achieved
through
the
custodian,
the
guardian
or
the
next
friend.
and
for
those
reasons,
the
due
process
argument
must
fall.
if
we
look
at
this
case
as
a
whole,
i
think
that
one
has
to
examine
that
the
retroactivity
issue
must
be
found
in
gene
jeter's
favor;
that
the
equal
protection
argument
must
fall;
and
that
the
due
process
argument
must
fall.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
