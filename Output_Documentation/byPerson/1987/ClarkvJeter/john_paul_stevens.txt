justice
stevens
before
you
get
to
the
equal
protection,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
about
the
statute.
would
it
not
comply
with
the
federal
statute
for
pennsylvania
to
say
today,
well,
we're
wrong
in
saying
the
six-year
statute
bars
the
action
completely,
but
we
will
now
allow
the
procedure
to
go
forward
to
permit
the
establishment
of
the
paternity
of
the
child,
but
now
allow
any
retroactive
recovery
before
the
paternity
is
established?
wouldn't
that
comply
literally
with
the
federal
statute?
do
you
understand
my
question?
justice
stevens
but
that
would
be
a
matter
of
pennsylvania
law
is
what
i'm...
it
would
comply
with
the
federal
statute
for
them
to
say,
well,
i
guess
we
do
have
to,
in
order
to
comply
literally
because
the
language
is
very
strong
as
you
say,
they'll
say,
well,
i
guess
we
cannot
apply
our
six-year
statute
to
prevent
you
from
establishing
your
paternity,
but
we
may
apply
the
six-year
statute
to
prevent
you
from
recovering
any
support
money
for
the
period
before
you
establish
paternity.
it
seems
to
me
that-would
be
consistent
with
the
statute,
and
that
wouldn't
satisfy
you.
then
you
would
still
say,
well,
i
guess
i
want
to
go
ahead
with
my
equal
protection
argument
anyway.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
what
do
you
mean
a
final
judgement?
this
is
still
the
same
case,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
if
the
pennsylvania
statute
clearly
applied
and
said
it
will
be
retroactive
to
all
cases
still
pending
in
our
court,
something
like
that,
the
fact
there
was
a
final
judgment
wouldn't
make
any
different,
would
it?
justice
stevens
but
what
if
the
federal
statute
says
that?
justice
stevens
it
says
procedures
which
permit
the
establishment
of
the
paternity
of
any
child
at
any
time
prior
to
such
child's
eighteenth
birth.
this
is
a
child
and
it's
prior
to
the
child's
eighteenth
birthday.
justice
stevens
so,
literally
this
federal
statute
clearly
applies,
does
it
not?
justice
stevens
do
you
acknowledge
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute?
justice
stevens
you
rely
on
the
fact...
you
just
don't
rely
on
the
retroactive
point.
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
final
judgment
here
even
though
the
case
was
still
on--
justice
stevens
--isn't
the
general
rule
that
an
appellate
court
looks
at
the
law
as
of
the
time
of
its
judgment
rather
than
as
of
the
time
of
the
trial
court's
judgment?
justice
stevens
what
you
would
say
it
means
paternity
of
any
child
at
any
time
prior
to
such
child's
eighteenth
birth
really
means
paternity
of
any
child
except
those
who
have
tried
to
establish
their
paternity
up
to
now
and
failed
to
do
so.
that's
what
you
construe--
