justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
we
could
also
hold
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania.
the
petitioner
is
the
mother
of
an
illegitimate
child.
she
sued
the
respondent
for
child
support
alleging
that
he
is
the
child's
father.
the
court
dismissed
the
suit
as
barred
by
pennsylvania
six-year
statute
of
limitations
for
paternity
actions.
the
statute
effectively
limits
the
time
within
which
suits
may
be
brought
to
obtain
child
support
for
illegitimate
children.
by
contrast,
suits
for
child
support
for
legitimate
children
may
be
brought
at
any
time
during
their
minority.
we
hold
in
the
opinion
filed
today
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
of
limitations
at
issue
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
statute
discriminates
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children
and
is
not
substantially
related
to
an
important
government
objective.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
below
and
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
