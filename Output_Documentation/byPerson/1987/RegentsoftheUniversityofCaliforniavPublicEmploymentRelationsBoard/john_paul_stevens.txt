justice
stevens
it
will
save
all
the
work
involved
in
delivering
this
mail
from
where
it
is
given
to
your
client
to
deliver
to
the
union
people,
won't
it?
and
if
they
are
losing
money
on
delivery
now
so
that
they
need
postal
rate
increases,
they
will
actually
be
better
off.
justice
stevens
i
thought
they
were
delivered
throughout
the
university
system?
are
all
the
deliveries
in
berkeley?
justice
stevens
it
is
a
big
state
and
there
are
a
lot
of
branches
of
the
university.
justice
stevens
mr.
wright,
what
is
the
compensation
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
but
it
is
a
statutory
requirement,
isn't
it,
that
they
do
this?
justice
stevens
tell
me
again,
what
is
the
compensation
to
the
university
for
doing
this?
justice
stevens
it
is
like
a
fringe
benefit
for
the
employees?
justice
stevens
you
don't
have
any
cases
that
are
remotely
like?
i
mean,
i
can
understand
the
theory
of
what
you
are
saying,
but
that
is
quite
different
from
any
of
your
precedents.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
i
still
don't
understand.
what
i
am
asking
is,
what
is
the
compensation?
one
thing
you
say,
the
compensation
is
the
services
of
the
employees
who
receive
the
mail.
justice
stevens
that's
the
compensation.
now,
you
said
there
are
two
other
things
that
might
be
compensation.
justice
stevens
in
exchange
for
what?
what
is
the
compensation?
justice
stevens
you
are
saying
that
this
exception
would
not
apply
if
i
asked
a
friend
to
deliver
a
mail
to
someone,
he
is
going
to
chicago
on
an
airplane
and
i
say
would
you
take
a
letter
along
and
he
says
yes,
i'll
do
it
for
you
if
you'll
do
the
same
thing
for
me
a
week
from
now
on
the
return
trip,
then
they
have
to
pay
postage?
justice
stevens
now,
what
is
your
third
compensation?
justice
stevens
i
take
it
there
is
always
some
expense
to
the
private
carrier
making
the
delivery.
the
fact
that
he
has
to
pay
his
own
bills
cannot
make
it.
justice
stevens
mr.
wright,
may
i
inquire
whether
you
think
we
owe
the
same
degree
of
deference
to
an
agency's
interpretation
or
construction
of
a
statute
by
regulation
if
the
effect
of
it
is
to
pre-empt
state
law?
justice
stevens
i
wonder
if
that
is
right.
read
the
second
sentence
of
the
regulation:
"if
the
individual
actually
carrying
the
letters
is
not
the
person
sending
the
letters.
"
and
of
course,
here,
it
is
not,
"or
to
whom
the
letters
are
addressed.
"
and
here
it
is
not,
"then
such
individual
must
be
an
officer
or
employee
of
such
person.
"
justice
stevens
and
he
isn't
here.
the
carrier
is
not
an
employee
of
the
union
which
originates
the
letter
nor
is
that
individual
an
employee
of
the
addressee
of
the
letter.
justice
stevens
you
are
assuming
that
the
addressees
are
the
university,
then?
justice
stevens
you
are
saying
the
letters
are
addressed
to
the
university?
justice
stevens
making
that
argument,
what
if
the
state
of
california,
or
the
legislature,
passed
a
statute
saying
it
is
part
of
the
responsibility
of
the
university
to
foster
good
neighborhood
relationships
and
one
way
to
do
that
will
be
to
add
to
the
business
of
the
university
delivery
of
free
mail
to
everybody
within
five
miles
of
the
campus?
would
that
be
then
part
of
the
business
of
the
university?
justice
stevens
they
would
be
people
who
are
neighbors
of
the
university.
