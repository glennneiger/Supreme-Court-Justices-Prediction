mr.
wright,
educate
me,
because
i
speak
from
ignorance.
in
the
last
decade
or
so,
we
have
seen
a
proliferation
of
federal
express
and
emory
and
all
these
other
overnight
carriers.
do
they
operate
under
some
special
statute?
justice
blackmun
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
devastating
competition
to
the
postal
service.
