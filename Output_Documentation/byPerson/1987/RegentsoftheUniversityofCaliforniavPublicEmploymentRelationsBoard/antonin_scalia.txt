scalia
you
think
it
is
clear
from
the
language?
justice
scalia
let's
talk
about
the
regulation.
you
urge
that
we
must
give
deference
to
the
regulation.
we
give
deference
to
the
regulations
of
agencies
that
are
charged
with
the
administration
of
particular
schemes.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
post
office
is
not
charged
with
administration
of
this
law
prohibiting
persons
other
than
the
post
office
from
carrying
mail.
that
is
like
saying
that
the
attorney
general
is
charged
with
administration
of
the
criminal
laws
so
we
should
defer
to
the
prosecutor's
determination
of
what
a
criminal
law
means.
you
are
not
administering
this
statute
at
all.
it
would
be
very
strange
to
say
you
are
administering
it.
to
the
contrary,
you
are
the
chief
competitor
of
those
who
are
trying
to
avoid
the
statute.
why
should
we
give
you
deference?
justice
scalia
what
provision
is
that
that
enables
them
to
do
that?
justice
scalia
thank
you.
justice
scalia
it
would
have
been
so
easy
to
say
that,
though.
it
would
have
been
so
easy
to
say
except
letters
addressed
to
or
from
a
business
and
relating
to
its
business.
it
is
not
as
though
it
is
difficult
to
describe
what
you
say
they
meant.
they
just
didn't
put
it
that
way.
they
just
said
it
has
to
relate
to
the
business.
justice
scalia
the
line
item
meaning
what?
100
percent?
justice
scalia
100
percent
of
whatever
mail
they
carry
gets
paid
for
by
the
state.
justice
scalia
the
state
has
told
them
to
carry
the
mail
and
the
state
is
going
to
pay
for
100
percent
of
the
carriage.
bingo.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
all
the
regulation
requires,
isn't
it?
isn't
that
compensation?
how
could
it
be
not
private
carriage?
the
state
is
directing
the
carriage
by
the
university
and
is
paying
the
university
for
doing
the
carriage.
justice
scalia
i
just
wonder
whether
you
could
not,
by
extending
that
reasoning,
apply
it
to
a
business
man
and
his
client.
i
mean,
in
the
same
sense
that
there
is
a
symbiotic
relationship
between
the
employer
and
the
union,
there
is
the
same
kind
of
relationship
between
a
businessman
and
a
client
of
his
and
you
could
say
that
in
facilitating
the
correspondence
of
let's
say
a
lawyer,
facilitating
the
correspondence
of
one
of
his
clients
with
another
client
who
are
more
or
less
in
the
same
businesses,
he
is
really
engaged
in
his
own
business
in
a
say
so
that
if
a
large
law
firm
got
in
the
business
of
distributing
mail
of
its
clients
one
to
another,
by
parity
of
reasoning
with
what
you
just
told
us,
they
are
really
parts
of
a
multi-faceted
business
arrangement.
justice
scalia
that's
right.
it's
from
one
client
to
another.
but
yours
is
to
the
carrier
only
in
the
address
sense,
that
is,
it
is
to
somebody
whose
address
is
in
the
university
of
california.
justice
scalia
the
president
of
the
university
of
california
could
not
say
"give
me
that
letter"
and
open
it
up
and
read
it,
could
he?
justice
scalia
it
is
not
addressed
to
him.
justice
scalia
correct.
justice
scalia
no,
a
regular
employee
of
either
the
addressee
or
the
sender.
justice
scalia
by
reason
of
the
statute,
they
have
been
made
part
of
the
university,
in
the
common
enterprise
of
fostering
community
relations,
just
as
the
union,
under
your
theory,
has
been
made
part
of
the
university
by
the
labor
laws.
whenever
laws
push
people
together
and
require
them
to
deal
with
one
another,
you
can
develop
a
theory
that
there
are
all
part
of
the
same
agency.
that
is
what
i
understand
your
theory
to
be.
