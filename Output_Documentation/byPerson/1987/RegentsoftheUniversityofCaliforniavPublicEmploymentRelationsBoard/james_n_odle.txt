mr.
james
n.
odle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
most
people
that
i
know
would
not
buy
a
stamp
if
they
could
get
their
letters
delivered
without
one.
this
case
is
about
whether
a
labor
union
can
get
its
letter
delivered
across
postal
routes
without
a
stamp.
the
united
states
postal
service
does
not
think
so.
neither
does
the
university
of
california.
but
the
perb,
that
is
the
california
public
employment
relations
board,
and
the
california
court
of
appeal,
have
found
that
california
law
requires
the
university
to
deliver
that
letter.
the
federal
body
of
law
known
as
the
private
express
statutes
generally
prohibits
delivery
of
mail
in
competition
with
the
postal
service.
perb
argues
that
two
exceptions
apply
here.
these
are
the
letters
of
the
carrier
exception
and
the
private
hands
without
compensation
exception.
this
is
a
technical
case,
in
that
it
turns
on
careful
reading
of
those
exceptions.
but
while
it
is
a
technical
case,
it
is
an
important
one,
because
there
are
millions
of
dollars
of
postal
service
revenue
at
stake
here.
mr.
james
n.
odle
it
will
cost
the
university
perhaps
some
money
in
that
there
may
be
more
letters
sent.
mr.
james
n.
odle
it
will
cost
the
postal
service
a
lot
of
money.
mr.
james
n.
odle
it
will
not
save
them
very
much,
actually.
mr.
james
n.
odle
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
they
are
losing
money
on
this
kind
of
delivery.
there
is
a
single
postal
rate
whether
you
send
a
letter
from
maine
to
california
or
across
berkeley.
and
this
is
mail
sent,
the
letters
in
this
case
would
have
been
sent
from
a
location
in
the
city
of
berkeley
to
the
university
in
berkeley,
and
it
probably
would
not
have
22
cents
a
letter
to
deliver
those.
mr.
james
n.
odle
the
case
arose
over
deliveries
in
berkeley,
but
i
think
that
you
are
right,
justice
stevens,
that
at
stake
here
is
a
larger
mail
system.
mr.
james
n.
odle
that
is
right.
mr.
james
n.
odle
yes,
it
will,
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
n.
odle
i
do.
or
at
least,
i
take
that
back,
it
may,
what
it
may
do
is
make
your
mail
slower.
i
doubt
that
it
will
make
it
faster.
the
amici,
in
this
case,
by
their
own
account,
represent
some
3,500,000
employees,
to
whom
they
are
eager
to
deliver
unstamped
letters.
mr.
james
n.
odle
these
are
employees
of
employers
across
the
country.
mr.
james
n.
odle
the
union
represents
those
employees.
mr.
james
n.
odle
i
believe
so.
mr.
james
n.
odle
it
has
to
be
recognized
that
if
the
postal
service
loses
the
revenue
from
those
letters,
other
patrons
of
the
postal
service
are
going
to
have
to
pay
for
it,
either
in
lower
quality
of
service
or
in
higher
rates.
and,
justice
marshall,
i
would
suggest
that
you
would
pay
for
it
in
lower
quality
of
service.
let
me
talk
about
the
two
exceptions.
the
letters
of
the
carrier
exception
is
the
exception
that
allows
the
university
to
deliver
its
own
letters
without
a
stamp.
the
language
of
that
exception
and
the
legislative
history
of
it
i
think
have
been
very
thoroughly
briefed.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
exception
applies
to
letters
sent
by
or
addressed
to
the
carrier...
in
this
case,
the
university.
mr.
james
n.
odle
i
think
it
is
very
clear
from
the
language
of
the
regulation,
justice
scalia.
mr.
james
n.
odle
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
postal
service
is
the
chief
competitor
of
those
who
would
deliver
it
in
competition
with
the
postal
service.
the
postal
service,
however,
it
seems
to
me,
does
administer
the
statute,
in
fact.
it
is
authorized
by
congress,
for
example,
to
suspend
the
operation
of
the
statute
in
what
the
postal
service
considers
to
be
appropriate
cases.
and
it
writes
suspensions
of
the
statute
which
specifically
enable
others
to
deliver
letters
which
the
postal
service
would
otherwise
deliver
itself.
mr.
james
n.
odle
i
can
point
you
to
the
code
of
federal
regulations
sections
in
which
the
suspensions
are
written.
the
legislation
is
in
section
601.
the
postal
service
may
suspend
the
operation
of
any
part
of
this
section
upon
any
mail
route
where
the
public
interest
requires
the
suspension.
that
is
section
601,
39
u.s.c.--
mr.
james
n.
odle
--the
letters
of
the
carrier
regulation
provides
that
the
sending
or
carrying
of
letters
is
permissible
if
they
are
sent
by
or
addressed
to
the
person
carrying
them.
now,
the
regulations
recognize
that
"person"
for
this
purpose
may
be
an
institution.
and
the
regulations
also
recognize
that
when
a
letter
is
sent
by
or
addressed
to
an
institution
it
is
going
to
have
to
be
carried
by
some
individual.
so
the
regulation
provides,
and
i
am
reading
here:
"if
the
individual
actually
carrying
the
letters
is
not
the
person
sending
the
letters
or
to
whom
the
letters
are
addressed,
then
such
individual
must
be
an
officer
or
employee
of
such
person.
"
in
other
words,
the
individual
who
actually
carries
the
letter
must
be
an
officer
or
employe
of
the
institution
sending
them
or
to
whom
they
are
addressed.
now,
the
person
carrying
these
letters
is
an
employe
of
the
university.
when
a
third
party,
like
a
union,
sends
a
letter,
the
sender
is
the
third
party.
so
the
issue
is,
is
the
university
the
receiver
of
that
letter?
and
the
answer
is,
it
depends.
if
the
letter
is
sent
to
someone
who
receives
it
as
an
agent
for
the
university,
who
receives
it
on
behalf
of
the
university,
it
makes
sense
to
call
that
a
letter
to
the
university.
if
the
person
who
receives
that
letter
doesn't
receive
it
as
an
agent
of
the
university,
but
receives
it
on
his
own
behalf,
it
is
not
a
letter
to
the
university.
for
example,
if,
as
the
university's
lawyer,
if
i
receive
a
letter
from
the
union
about
this
case,
i
receive
that
letter
on
behalf
of
the
university
and
it
is
a
letter
to
the
university.
if
i
receive
a
letter
from
a
union
saying
mr.
odle,
we
think
you
ought
to
join
the
union
and
authorize
it
to
bargain
on
your
behalf
with
the
university
and
try
to
get
you
a
higher
wage
and
maybe
strike
against
the
university
if
you
don't
get
it,
that
is
not
a
letter
to
the
university.
that
is
a
letter
to
me.
mr.
james
n.
odle
well,
you
realize
first
that
the
regulation
states
a
two-part
test.
the
letter
must
relate
to
the
current
business
of
the
university
and
it
must
be
to
or
from
the
university.
mr.
james
n.
odle
that
is
right.
and
i
believe
that
the
intent
in
enacting
that
statute
in
1909,
as
we
have
argued
in
the
brief,
was
to
codify
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
dated
1896.
mr.
james
n.
odle
i
think
we
would
if
we
read
the
statute
properly.
i
think
that
we
would
fall,
that
these
letters
would
fall
outside
of
the
intent
of
the
statute,
if
that
is
your
question.
i
think
that
because
the
attorney
general's
opinion
which
preceded
the
statute
is
very
clear
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
is
very
clear
that
what
congress
meant
was
to
embody
that
opinion
in
the
statute.
and
there
is
another
attorney
general's
opinion
a
year
later,
in
1910,
which
says
that
that
is
what
congress
meant
and
that
is
what
it
did.
and
that
law
has
been
on
the
books
in
that
form
ever
since.
mr.
james
n.
odle
that
is
true,
justice
scalia.
and
i
don't
know
why
they
did
not
put
it
that
way.
i
do
know
that
congress
was
told
by
other
congressmen,
by
congressmen
who
were
instrumental
in
promoting
the
1909
legislation,
that
it
would
in
fact
embody
the
attorney
general's
opinion.
but
as
to
why
they
felt
it
was
not
necessary
to
go
into
that
detail,
i
don't
know.
i
think
they
felt
that
they
read
this
phrase,
relates
to
the
current
business,
in
a
somewhat
narrower
way
than
it
could
be
read.
why
that
is,
i
am
not
sure.
as
further
evidence
that
the
letter
is
not
a
letter
to
the
university,
if
more
evidence
of
that
is
needed,
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
it
would
violate
california
labor
law
for
the
university
to
read
that
letter,
just
as
it
would
violate
federal
law
for
an
employer
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
to
read
such
a
letter
from
a
union
to
the
employee.
perb
argues
that
if
the
letters
of
the
carrier
exception
doesn't
apply,
the
private
hands
without
compensation
exception
does.
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
university
is
compensated.
we
receive
money
from
the
california
legislature
which
pays
for
the
operation
of
the
mail
system.
and
the
california
legislature
is
also
the
entity
that
has
ordered
us
to
deliver
the
mail.
it
just
offends
common
sense
to
say
that
mail
which
is
ordered
and
paid
for
by
the
same
entity
is
not
compensated.
perb
argues
that
the
intent
is
the
key
here,
that
if
the
intent
is
to
compete,
the
exception
does
not
apply
but
if
there
is
another
intent,
it
may
apply.
the
problem
is
that
the
california
intent
here,
the
legislature's
intent,
is
clearly
to
withhold
revenue
from
the
postal
service.
the
purpose
is
to
facilitate
communication,
but
to
facilitate
it
in
just
one
way...
by
making
it
cheaper.
it
is
sophistry
to
say
that
the
legislature
intends
to
save
significant
dollars
for
the
unions
but
doesn't
intend
to
withhold
significant
dollars
from
the
postal
service
when
they
are
the
very
same
dollars.
anyone
setting
up
to
compete
with
the
postal
service
on
more
economical
routes
like
these
could
claim
to
be
facilitating
communication
by
making
it
cheaper.
the
problem
is
that
there
has
been
a
national
decision,
there
should
be
a
national
postal
rate,
there
should
be
a
postal
service
to
accomplish
that.
and
to
preserve
that
service,
it
is
necessary
to
say
you
cannot
compete
with
it
unless
you
fall
under
one
of
the
exceptions.
those
exceptions
are
to
be
made
by
congress,
not
by
the
california
legislature.
mr.
james
n.
odle
the
university
of
california
has
about
100,000
employees.
we
use
the
system
to
deliver
our
own
mail.
that
is,
mail
sent
to
or
from
the
university
of
california
employees.
mr.
james
n.
odle
if
it
is
down
the
hall,
he
probably
carries
it.
he
may
send
it
through
the
university's
mail
system.
it
may
not
be
involved
with
these
laws,
because
it
has
to
cross
a
postal
route
to
be
subject
to
these
laws.
mr.
james
n.
odle
because
if
the
professor's
letter
is
sent
to
another
university
employee
on
the
business,
that
is,
as
a
representative
of
the
university,
it
is
a
letter
to
the
university.
the
problem
is
that
the
union
letters
are
not.
mr.
james
n.
odle
i
would
say
it
depends,
justice
marshall,
if
i
may
just
take
a
moment
to
answer.
mr.
james
n.
odle
let
us
suppose
that
the
professor
at
harvard
has
applied
for
a
job,
and
one
professor
writes
to
another
and
says
he
is
good,
i
think
you
ought
to
hire
him.
that
would
be
a
letter
to
the
university.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
james
n.
odle
--i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
letter
to
the
university
and
i
don't
think
it
could
be
carried
by
the
university.
mr.
james
n.
odle
that's
right.
mr.
james
n.
odle
unless
you
wanted
to
know
that
in
order
to
conduct
university
business,
your
letter
would
not
be
a
letter
of
the
university.
you
could
write
to
that
other
professor
asking
him
if
he
wants
to
join
you
for
halloween,
and
that
would
not
be
a
letter
of
the
university.
mr.
james
n.
odle
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
more
complicated
than
yes
or
no.
certainly,
collective
bargaining
is
the
university's
business
in
the
sense
that
we
engage
in
it,
we
hire
people
to
do
it,
and
if
there
is
a
letter
from
our
collective
bargainer,
to
the
president
of
the
university,
about
union
negotiations,
that
is
certainly
a
letter
of
the
university.
but
the
issue
here
is,
if
there
is
a
letter
from
the
union
encouraging
an
employee
to
join
the
union,
is
that
a
letter
to
the
university?
and
we
think
it
is
not.
