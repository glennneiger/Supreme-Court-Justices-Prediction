mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
broad
constructions
of
the
private
express
statutes
like
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal
below
do
reduce
the
scope
of
the
postal
monopoly
and
threaten
to
reduce
postal
revenues.
as
mr.
odle
said,
the
fact
that
three
and
a
half
million
employees
are
represented
by
the
amici
in
this
case
shows
that
a
substantial
amount
of
mail
could
be
diverted
from
the
postal
service.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
section
401,
39
u.s.c.
401,
which
is
quoted
in
a
footnote
on
page
23
of
our
brief.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
certainly
do.
the
statute
says
that
the
postal
service
has
authority
to
adopt,
amend,
and
repeal
such
rules
and
regulations
as
it
deems
necessary
to
accomplish
the
objectives
of
this
title,
which
include
the
private
express
statutes.
congress
has
quite
clearly
given
the
postal
service
authority
to
define
what
these
statutes
mean.
it
is
true
that
the
postal
service
is
also
the
beneficiary
of
this
statute.
i
take
that
to
mean
that
congress
would
not
expect
the
most
liberal
interpretation
of
the
statute.
it
would
expect
the
contrary.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
in
turning
to
the
letters
of
the
carrier
exception,
this
is
a
classic
case
of
deference.
this
is
a
long
standing
interpretation
that
was
originally
formulated
contemporaneously
with
the
relevant
statutory
amendment
which
was
in
1909,
and
it
has
been
consistently
followed
ever
since.
i
would
like
to
go
through
that
briefly,
the
legislative
history.
first,
let
me
note,
the
words
of
the
statute
are
ambiguous.
it
could
be
construed
the
way
the
postal
service
has
done
it.
it
could
be
construed
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
it.
i
would
say
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
letters
to
institutions
can
only
be
sent
to
their
representatives.
that
is
the
way
the
postal
service
has
construed
it,
and
the
issue
is
whether
they
have
properly
done
so.
i
would
think
that
the
language
of
the
statute
letters
relating
to
the
current
business
of
the
carrier
would
normally
be
sent
to
representatives,
would
not
be
sent
to
someone
else
in
the
case
of
an
institution.
it
is
true
that
you
can
define
the
business
of
something
like
a
university
very
broadly
and
include
almost
everything,
including
the
letters
here.
so
i
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
language
is
ambiguous.
but
this
is
a
case
where
the
legislative
history
is
very,
very
clear.
in
the
1896
attorney
general
opinion
letter
that
was
referred
to,
the
attorney
general
concluded,
despite
the
lack
of
a
basis
in
the
language
of
the
private
express
statutes
at
that
time,
that
a
railroad
could
carry
its
own
letters.
he
said
that
the
right
he
identified
was
quote:
"to
carry
letters
written
and
sent
by
the
officers
and
agents
of
the
railroad
company
which
carries
and
delivers
them,
about
its
business,
and
these
only.
"
unquote.
he
added
that:
"companies
could
not
carry
letters
that
are
neither
written
by
that
company
nor
addressed
to
it.
"
in
1909,
when
congress
added
the
language
at
issue
here,
the
principal
proponent
of
the
amendment
was
senator
bacon.
and
he
wanted
to
revise
the
statute
to
express
in
exact
language
what
the
attorney
general
says
it
means.
the
senator
who
actually
proposed
the
language
of
the
amendment
was
senator
sutherland,
and
he
said
that
that
was
its
purpose.
and
the
conference
report,
which
was
printed
in
the
congressional
record
at
that
time
said
that
it
put
the
statute
quote:
"in
exact
conformity
with
the
construction
placed
upon
existing
law.
"
and
then
referred
to
attorney
general
harmon's
1896
opinion
letter.
legislative
history
is
rarely
this
clear.
but
there
can
be
no
question
that
congress
intended
to
codify
the
1986
opinion
which
stated
that
railroads
could
carry
letters
sent
to
or
by
its
officers
and
agents
but
not
letters
that
are
neither
written
by
nor
sent
to
the
company.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
the
postal
service
is
also
authorized
to
suspend
the
operation
of
the
statutes
where
the
public
interest
so
requires.
in
1979,
it
did
so
for
extremely
urgent
letters
which
are
defined
in
the
regulations
basically
to
be
letters
that
cost
a
certain
multiple
of
normal
postage.
it
is
a
regulatory
suspension
under
which
federal
express
operates.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
legislative
history
of
the
1979
amendment...
we
cited
the
hearings
in
our
brief...
the
postal
service
adopted
that
suspension
somewhat
reluctantly.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
congress
would
have
enacted
it
statutorily
if
the
postal
service
had
not
come
up
with
a
regulation.
but
it
did
and
that
solved
the
problem.
perb
suggests
that
its
interpretation
of
the
private
express
statute
warrants
deference.
we
think
that
that
is
plainly
wrong.
its
interpretation
of
the
california
statute
that
says
that
unions
can
use...
the
california
statute
says
that
unions
can
use...
the
means
of
communication
of
employers.
perb
has
construed
that
to
mean
internal
mail
systems.
we
have
not
quarreled
with
that.
that
is
entitled
to
deference.
but
congress
gave
the
postal
service,
in
section
401,
the
authority
to
construe
the
private
express
statutes.
it
didn't
give
that
authority
to
perb.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
other
exception
that
perb
says
authorizes
the
deliver
here,
the
private
hands
without
compensation
exception.
this
is
another
long
standing
exception.
the
precise
language
dates
back
to
1845,
the
private
hands
without
compensation.
in
1846,
a
district
court
stated
that
a
deliverer
of
merchandise
could
not
also
deliver
letters
even
though
it
did
not
make
any
separate
charge
for
the
delivery.
and
the
postal
service
has
followed
that
interpretation
ever
since.
more
recently,
in
the
1970s,
a
number
of
cases
came
up
involving
school
districts
who
wanted
to
deliver
union
letters,
very
similar
cases
to
this
one.
in
some
of
these
cases,
collective
bargaining
agreements
spelled
out
a
duty
to
carry
the
union's
letters.
in
those
cases,
i
think
it
is
clear
beyond
doubt,
and
i
do
not
understand
perb
to
disagree,
that
compensation
was
involved.
as
the
prior
case
demonstrates,
employers
and
unions
are
in
an
adversarial
relationship.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
there
are
three
different
kinds
of
compensation
here.
first,
this
is
all
part
of
a
bargain
under
which
the
employees
give
their
labor
to
the
university.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
if
there
was
a
statutory
requirement
that
the
university's
dental
school
give
free
service
to
union
employees,
or
just
employees
of
the
university,
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
any
question
that
that
would
arise
out
of
the
employment
relationship,
and
the
compensation
to
the
university
of
the
employees'
labor
was
compensation
whether
or
not
it
was
statutory
or
contractual.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
three
things.
our
first
argument
is
that
it
is
the
labor
of
the
employees,
and
their
agent,
the
employees'
agent,
the
union,
gets
to
send
these
letters.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
exactly.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
this
is
a
unique
case,
because
the
state
has
ordered
the
carrying.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
second,
the
fact
is
that
the
state
is
the
employer
here,
and
it
is
just
like
the
school
district
cases,
in
our
view,
except
that
the
unions
go
and
negotiate
with
the
legislature
rather
than
directly
with
the
university.
they've
gone
up
a
step.
we
think
that
that
is
clear,
if
you
look
at
the
next
case.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
right.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
our
next
answer
is
that
this
is
just
like
the
school
district
cases.
if
the
union
had
bargained
a
contract
provision,
if
you
will
grant
me
that
there
is
clearly
compensation
there,
if
an
employer
agrees
to
deliver
an
union's
mail--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--presumably
it
is
agreeing
to
some
other
demand
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
is
usually
implicit.
it
is
not
spelled
out.
in
this
case,
they've
got
that
through
the
legislature.
in
the
next
case,
if
we
should
lose
this
case,
the
unions
will
go
to
state
legislatures
and
say,
you
can
give
us
a
big
benefit.
we
will
save
a
lot
of
money
if
we
can
use
internal
mail
systems,
and
this
will
cost
you
very
little.
please
pass
a
law.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
would
say
there
is
compensation
here.
as
it
happens,
the
special
messenger
exception
to
the
private
express
statutes
would
cover
that,
in
any
other
case
where
he
was
handling
fewer
than
25
letters.
but
the
private
hands
without
compensation
exception
would
not
apply
there.
there
would
be
compensation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
third
case
is,
perb
says
we're
wrong.
it
says
you
are
wrong
to
say
the
state
is
the
employer.
the
state
and
the
university
are
different.
but
if
that
is
true,
then
it
is
even
more
clear
that
it
is
compensation,
that
there
is
compensation
here,
because
the
university
is
both
ordering
them
to
carry
mail
and
paying
for
it,
because
it
funds
the
university.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
but
it
is
different
if
the
person
ordering
it
also
pays
for
it.
if
i
ask
you
to
deliver
a
letter
and
give
you
money
to
do
it,
even
if
it
is
a
letter
from
someone
else
and
being
received
by
someone
else,
even
if
it
is
not
my
letter,
if
i
am
both
telling
you
to
pay
for
it
and
paying
you
to
do
so,
i
am
compensating
you
for
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
we
think
so.
i
would
like
to
make
one
other
point.
perb
has
also
argued
that
the
postal
service
has
not
been
consistent
in
its
application
of
these
statutes,
relying
on
an
indianapolis
cased
where
the
postal
service
said
that
a
school
district
could
carry
letters
from
a
community
service
group
to
students
about
food
stamp
programs.
we
think
it
quite
clear
that
there
is
no
form
of
compensation
there.
none
of
the
three
forms
of
compensation
that
i
mentioned
briefly
a
moment
ago
or
in
more
detail
in
our
brief
would
apply.
