chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
number
86-935,
regents
of
the
university
of
california
v.
public
employment
relations
board,
et
al.
mr.
odle,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
3,500,000
employees
of
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
oh,
i
see.
i
see.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
odle.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
biren.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
biren,
let
me
ask
you.
supposing
if
the
3,500,000
were
filing
an
amicus
brief
here
all
succeed
in
getting
what
you
say
the
university
of
california
employees
get,
do
you
think
that
would
be
pursuant
to
congressional
design?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
state
funding,
i
mean,
did
the
california
legislature
appropriate
money
to
the
university
of
california
to
perform
these
services?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
far
as
you
can
see,
the
university
will
get
the
same
line
item,
if
it
is
a
line
item,
for
carrying
mail,
even
after
this
as
before?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
would
be
one
thing
if
the
university
were
here
insisting
that
they
had
a
right
to
do
this
under
the
statute.
but
the
university
says
no.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
you
would
have
a
little
bit
different
case
here
if
the
university
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
case
and
it
was
the
university
and
the
unions
against
the
government,
in
effect.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
talking
about
both.
the
business
of
the
university
and
the
private
hands.
chief
justice
rehnquist
from
whom
do
these
letters...
who
sends
them
and
who
receives
them?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
was
the
subject
of
the
letters?
chief
justice
rehnquist
to
get
people
to
join
the
union?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
william
wilson
sent
another
kind
of
letter
to
another
university
employee
that
said
let's
organize
a
camping
trip
next
weekend?
is
the
reason
that
would
not
be
barred
or
would
be
barred
by
the
private
carrier
exception
that
it
isn't
the
business
of
the
university?
chief
justice
rehnquist
pardon
me.
the
business
of
the
carrier
exception.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
legislature
then
says
we
think
we
should
encourage
all
employees
of
the
university
to
get
out
in
the
great
california
park
system
and
that
is
a
state
duty
of
the
university
to
encourage
these
people
to
get
out?
now,
then,
would
that
change
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
california
legislature
surely
has
any
number
of
areas
of
authority
over
the
state
university
of
california.
its
police
power
is
very,
very
broad,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
you
say
it
was
beyond
the
competence
of
the
california
legislature
to
pass
a
statute
saying
that
it
is
the
business
of
the
university
of
california
to
encourage
its
employees
to
get
out
in
the
wilderness
over
the
weekend?
would
you
say
that
that
is
just
beyond
the
competence
of
the
legislature?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
agree
then
that
with
a
letter
from
mr.
wilson
of
the
circumstances
i
have
described
and
with
the
statute,
could
that
be
carried
by
the
university
mail
system
without
violating
the
private
express
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
wilson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
who
wants
to
go
camping
by
themselves?
you
have
to
get
some
other
people.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
biren.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-935,
regents
of
the
university
of
california
versus
public
employment
relations
board
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
