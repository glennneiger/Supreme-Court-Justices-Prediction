ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
here
is
whether
california's
strong
state
interest
in
efficient
communication
and
effective
communication
between
employees
and
their
representatives
as
codified
in
heera
can
be
harmonized
with
the
private
express
statutes.
the
state
has
determined
that
the
university
of
california
has
a
statutory
duty
to
allow
employee
organizations
to
carry
this
mail
to
employees
in
order
to
make
the
heera
scheme
of
cooperative
labor
relations
effective.
the
private
express
statutes,
we
submit,
can
be
harmonized
with
the
state
law
by
using
either
one
of
the
two
exceptions
that
have
been
discussed
this
afternoon,
the
business
of
the
carrier
exception
or
the
private
hands
without
compensation
exception.
postage
foregone
under
one
of
these
exceptions
is
postage
forgone
pursuant
to
congressional
design.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
not
the
least
bit
clear
that
all
3,500,000
of
them
would
be
covered
under
a
decision
in
our
favor
in
this
case.
we
have
relied
substantially
on
a
specific
statute
here,
heera,
which
really
sets
up
a
very
cooperative
labor
relations
scheme
in
which
the
employees
are
supposed
to
be
allowed
the
fullest
participation
possible
through
their
employee
organizations
in
the
determinations
of
conditions
of
employment,
and
there
is
an
access
statute
which
specifically
says
that
these
employees
can
hear
from
their
employee
organizations
through
the
mail
system.
that
is
not
the
case
in
many
states
represented
by
amici.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
if
you
were
particularly
bothered
by
the
fact
that--
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
--i
think
that
these
deliveries
are
within
both
the
statute
and
the
regulation.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
for
several
reasons.
first,
i
think--
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
--in
terms
of
the
regulation,
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
talk
about.
as
i
said,
here
is
a
cooperative
labor
relations
scheme
in
which
the
employees
are
part
of
the
decision
making
on
something
that
is
patently
the
business
of
the
carrier...
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
of
the
employees.
through
their
representatives,
they
participate
in
bargaining
over
this.
therefore,
as
to
this
particular
business
of
the
university...
labor
relations,
the
determination
of
terms
and
conditions
of
employment...
these
employees
are
equal
partners
in
that
decision
making,
and
their
representatives,
therefore,
are
their
agents.
they
are
their
agents.
and
i
think
it
is
stretching
it,
but
i
think
in
a
broader
view,
if
you
insisted
upon
the
agency
concept,
which
i
do
not
think
is
present
in
either
the
statute
or
the
regulation,
you
could
say
that
they
are
the
agents
of
the
university
as
a
whole
in
fulfilling
its
total
duty
under
heera
to
allow
employees
to
participate
to
the
fullest
extent
in
the
labor
relations
scheme.
i
have
made
one
of
the
points
i
wanted
to
make,
regarding
carriage,
at
issue
here,
being
within
the
statute
and
the
regulation,
because
of
the
carrier's
business.
the
other
point
that
i
would
go
into
at
more
length
is
under
the
private
hands
without
compensation
exception,
to
show
that
the
university
is
not
private
hands,
because
it
is
not
the
postal
service,
and
there
is
no
compensation
for
carriage
because
compensation
has
traditionally
been
interpreted
as
money,
identifiable
goods
or
services,
and
lately,
since
1976,
good
will,
flowing
between
the
user
and
the
carrier.
state
funding
does
not
meet
that
description.
state
funding
is
not
compensation,
within
the
intent
of
congress
when
it
passed
the
private
hands
without
compensation
exception.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
the
state
of
california
appropriates
money
to
fund
the
mail
system.
it
did
before
heera
existed.
it
did
before
this
order
existed
and
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
that
there
is
any
relationship
between
the
order
to
carry
this
mail
and
the
type
of
funding
they
received
for
the
mail
system.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
to
the
extent
that
the
record
deals
with
this
matter,
that
seems
to
be
the
case.
there
is
no
showing
that
made
any
difference.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
right.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
that's
right.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
because
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
traditional
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
compensation
within
this
exception,
if
you
start
from
1792,
in
the
first
statute
it
talked
about
for
hire
or
reward.
it
went
through,
and
there
was
an
identifiable
exchange
of
money,
goods
or
services
between
the
user
and
the
carrier.
the
state
here
is
no
the
user.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
no.
well,
the
only
thing
that
is
close
is
the
advisory
opinion
in
77(a)
which
allows
the
indianapolis
school
board
to
carry
the
circular.
obviously,
in
terms
of
the
compensation
they
receive,
the
compensation
for
that
mail
system
is
no
different
than
the
compensation
here.
the
state
funds
the
mail
system
for
the
school
board
in
indianapolis.
or
i
am
not
sure
exactly
who
funds
it.
but
the
government
funds
it.
just
following
that
through,
staying
with
the
private
hands
without
compensation
exception,
in
1846,
in
united
states
v.
thompson,
the
paying
for
merchandise
there
was,
on
could
see
it
as
pumped
up
to
include
the
payment
for
the
carriage
of
letters.
this
court,
in
1878,
in
ex
parte
jackson,
talked
about
the
purpose
of
the
postal
monopoly
as
being
to
prohibit
carriage
for
hire.
in
1896,
the
attorney
general's
opinion
talked
about
traded
services
between
railroads.
and
in
1908,
in
the
discussions
in
congress
about
the
business
of
the
carrier
exception,
they
talked
about
their
understanding
of
the
postal
monopoly,
which
was
to
prevent
carriage
for
profit.
again,
the
intent
of
congress
here
was
to
avoid
entrepreneurial
competition
with
the
postal
service.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
the
university
does
say
no.
but
i
am
afraid
i'm
missing
the
import
of
your
question.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
are
you
talking
specifically
about
the
private
hands
exception?
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
let
me
give
you
an
example
in
return,
because
i
think
it
shows.
when
a
state
law
imposes
a
duty
on
an
employer,
it
is
not
always
a
happy
thing.
suppose
a
developer
had
to
fill
out
environmental
impact
statements.
they
don't
necessarily
want
to
do
that.
but
it
still
their
state
law
duty.
it
is
still
part
of
their
business.
and
i
think
that
is
analogous
to
the
situation
here.
the
university
may
not
want
to
do
it,
but
the
state
has
said,
in
the
interests
of
society
and
in
the
university's
interests,
and
in
the
interests
of
the
employees,
they
do
need
to
do
this.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
they
do,
indeed.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
it
appears
to
me
that
what
they
do
is
they
inform
them
that
they
are
carrying
in
error.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
they
have.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
and
that's
why
we're
here.
precisely.
but
our
contention
is
that
these
two
statutory
and
regulatory
exceptions
provide
for
this
type
of
carriage,
because
in
the
business
of
the
carrier
exception,
to
do
otherwise,
we
submit,
would
simply
be
irrational
and
as
we
have
said
with
private
hands
without
compensation
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
previous
interpretation.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
congress
may
wish
to
expand
its
definition
of
compensation
from
these
identifiable
goods
and
services,
but
until
it
does
so--
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
--which
regulation
are
we
talking
about?
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
no,
i
don't
argue
that
it
is
invalid.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
correctly
interpreted
to
allow
employees
to
receive
mail
in
the
labor
relations
situation,
yes.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
i
think
that
the
regulation
is
certainly
an
expansion
of
the
plain
words
of
the
statute.
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
say
such
as
relates
to
the
business
of
the
carrier.
we
have
not
directly
attached
the
validity
of
the
regulation
and
have
assumed
arguendo
it
is
valid
because
we
believe
that
this
carriage
is
appropriate
under
both
the
statute
and
the
regulation.
it
is
appropriate
under
the
regulation
because
mail
is
going
to
uc.
the
address
says
"university
of
california",
to
university
of
california
employees.
it
is
from
a
uc
employee
representative
organization.
in
this
case,
it
was
also
from
a
uc
employee
on
the
uc
campus.
and
it
is
on
university
business.
and
we
believe
that
brings
it
within
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
regulation,
as
well
as
the
statute.
in
the
labor
relations
context,
it
would
really
be
unreasonable
not
to
interpret
it
this
way,
because
when
you
talk
about
agency
in
terms
of
control
of
the
employee
response,
which
the
university
has
done
in
its
brief,
that
is
illegal
in
the
labor
relations
context.
and
it
is
specifically
illegal
under
the
heera
scheme.
rather,
in
this
cooperative
scheme,
you
have
a
pluralistic
university
with
many
parts,
and
the
employee
part
has
a
role
to
play
in
decision
making
on
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
middle
ground
between
an
identity
of
interest
with
management
and
a
personal
interest.
and
that
middle
ground
is
the
interest
we
find
here,
which
is
of
employees
participating
in
the
labor
relations
scheme
through
their
employee
organizations.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
but
there
are
two
distinctions.
the
first
distinction
is
that
in
this
case
the
business
is
state
law
duty.
there
is
no
state
law
bonding
between
the
client
and
the
attorney
in
your
example.
and
secondly,
in
the
regulation
there
is
also
the
necessity
that
it
be
to
the
carrier.
and
in
your,
i
believe
in
your
hypothetical,
it
is
not
necessarily
to
the
carrier.
i'm
not
sure
who
was
carrying
in
your
hypothetical.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
my
argument
is
twofold
in
that
case,
too.
it
is
more
than
just
the
address,
although
i
believe
the
address
is
important.
when
you
think
of
the
administration
of
this
regulation,--
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
--well,
in
fact,--
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
--but
under
this
exception,
they
do
have
the
right
to
monitor
the
mail.
and
so
i
am
not
sure
it
is
at
all
true
that
he
could
not
open
it
up
and
look
at
it.
the
university
has
claimed
that
that
might
subject
them
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
but
i
would
submit
to
you
that
anyone
can
file
a
charge
about
anything.
whether
or
not
it
leads
to
the
issuance
of
a
complaint
and
whether
or
not
it
would
be
upheld
by
the
board
is
a
totally
different
matter.
in
a
situation
in
which
the
university
is
compelled
to
monitor
this
mail,
i
find
it
highly
doubtful
that
perb
would
decide
that
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
monitor
the
mail.
so
the
distinctions
i
was
pointing
out
were
that
it
was
to
the
carrier
in
the
sense
of
the
labor
relations
scheme
that
the
employers
are
part
of
the
components
of
the
entity
that
make
business
decisions;
and
it
is
to
them
in
terms
of
their
address,
as
well.
i
think
it
is
important
also
to
note
that
there
is
no
agency
requirement
on
the
face
of
the
statute
or
the
regulation.
it
simply
doesn't
say
that.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
that
is
talking
about
who
carries
the
letters.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
what
they
are
saying
is
you
cannot
have
a
subcontractor
carrying
these
letters,
it
has
to
be
a
regular
employee
of
the
university.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
exactly.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
our
contention
is
that
in
the
sense
that
the
employees
here
represent
part
of
the
university
that
makes
its
business
decisions
on
labor
relations,
that
that
carrier
is
being
employed
by
the
university.
and
they
are
part
of
the
university.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
oh,
yes.
the
addressees
were
at
the
university.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
they
are
addressed
to
the
university.
it
says
here,
william
wilson,
u.c.,
berkeley.
so
it
is
addressed
to
the
university.
but
also,
that
they
participate
in
this
decision
making.
and
as
i
said,
if
the
agency
concept
is
pushed
to
its
outer
limits,
i
think
you
could
see
them
as
agents
of
the
entire
university,
in
that
it
is
under
heera,
the
specific
responsibility
of
the
university
to
foster
and
environment
in
which
the
employees
can
participate
to
the
fullest
in
the
labor
relations
scheme.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
certainly
it
would
be
a
state
law
duty
of
the
university,
and
to
that
extent,
it
would
be
the
business
of
the
university.
the
letters,
i
believe,
in
your
example,
would
not
be
from
the
university
or
to
the
university,
though.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
but
that
is
not
to
or
from
the
university.
those
are
the
kind
of
through
letters
that
are
talked
about
in
the
attorney
general's
opinion.
the
letters
here
were
not
through
letters.
they
went
to
the
university.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
my
theory
is
beyond
that,
because
we
are
not...
without
having
your
entire
statutory
scheme
about
the
neighborliness
before
me
it
is
somewhat
difficult.
but
in
this
situation,
they
are
doing
cooperative
decision
making
on
what
is
patently
the
business
of
the
carrier,
which
is
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
under
which
the
carrier's
employees
work.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
in
this
case,
a
university
employee,
william
wilson,
sent
the
letters
to
other
university
employees.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
the
subject
of
the
letters
was
an
organizing
meeting.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
exactly.
and
self
organization
is
explicitly
one
of
the
rights
guaranteed
to
employees
under
heera
and
one
of
the
rights
which
the
university
is
supposed
to
help
create
the
atmosphere
for.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
well,
it
is
not
the
private
carrier
exception,
it
would
be
the
business
of
the
carrier
exception.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
yes.
it
is
not
the
business
of
the
university.
it
is
a
personal
letter.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
it
would
be
then
the
state
law
duty
and
yes,
it
would
change
it,
but...
yes,
it
would
change
it.
but
here
we
have
a
specific
police
power
of
the
state
involved,
labor
relations,
in
which
there
is
a
strong
interest
in
having--
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
--that
is
right.
its
police
power
is
broad.
but
i
think
it
does
have
an
outer
limit,
at
which
point
the
harmonization
required
between
federal
law
and
state
law--
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
--no,
i
don't
think
it
is
beyond
the
competence
of
the
legislature.
no.
but
i
am
afraid
i
must
be
missing
the
thrust
of
your
question.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
it
could
be
carried
if
it
was
specifically
the
state
law
duty
imposed
by
law
and
it
was
going
either
from
the
carrier...
in
other
words
from--
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
--well,
it
could
be
going
from
mr.
wilson
to
other
agents
of
the
carrier
on
the
business
of
the
carrier.
yes.
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
realize
that
labor
relations
holds
a
very
special
place
and
that
it
isn't
the
case
that
it
is
likely
for
california
to
pass
that
type
of
law.
i
did
do
a
great
deal
of
thinking
about
those
types
of
laws,
in
preparing
for
this
argument.
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
realize
that
labor
relations
is
a
special
subject
and
this
decision
by
the
legislature
to
foster
these
labor
relations
puts
this
type
of
carrier
in
a
special
place.
and
further,
perhaps
another
distinction
is
that
in
this
statutory
scheme,
there
is
a
special
place
for
access,
that
the
facilitation
of
effective
communication
is
particularly
important
because
of
the
problems
in
labor
relations
that
this
court
knows
about
historically,
of
employee
organizations
being
able
to
communicate
with
their
employees.
there
is
a
long
standing
public
policy
in
california
to
allow
in
public
employment
this
type
of
mail
system
communication
between
public
employees
and
their
organizations.
there
is
a
1965
california
attorney
general
opinion
on
the
subject.
and
in
the
hypotheticals
that
you
were
propounding,
i
don't
think
you
will
see
that
kind
of
long
standing
history.
ms.
andrea
l.
biren
that's
right.
well,
through
the
u.s.
mail.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
think
i
will
take
my
leave.
thank
you
very
much.
