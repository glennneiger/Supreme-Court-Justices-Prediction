justice
o'connor
mr.
odle,
i
thought
that
the
state
legislature
in
california
has
determined
that
providing
unions
access
to
the
internal
mail
of
the
mail
system
is
the
current
business
of
the
university,
or
has
made
some
effort
legislatively
to
say
that
it
is
defining
the
business
of
the
university
as
including
this.
now,
what
do
we
do
with
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course,
the
statute
itself,
section
1694,
refers
to,
as
the
exception,
except
such
as
relates
to
the
current
business
of
the
carrier.
justice
o'connor
is
that
your
interpretation
of
the
regulation
and
the
validity
of
it?
you
would
not
fall
within
the
letters
of
the
carrier
exception?
you
depend
on
the
regulation
totally,
i
gather.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
california
court
of
appeals.
it
involves
an
application
of
the
so-called
"private
express
statute",
and
these
provision
generally
prohibit
the
carriage
of
mail
by
anyone
but
the
united
states
postal
service.
there
are
number
of
exceptions
to
this
general
prohibition,
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
either
of
two
of
those
exceptions
the
letters-of-the-carrier
exception,
which
allows
an
entity
to
carry
its
own
mail
or
the
private
hands
exception,
which
permits
the
carriage
of
mail
without
compensation,
permit
the
carriage
of
mail
involved
here.
the
appellant
is
a
state
university.
state
labor
laws
have
been
construed
by
the
appellee,
a
state
agency,
to
require
appellant
to
carry
in
its
interoffice
mail,
certain
letters
that
a
union
wants
to
have
delivered
to
some
of
the
appellant's
employees.
the
california
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
this
carriage
was
permissible.
we
disagree,
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
reverse.
neither
exception
applies
to
the
letters
involved
in
this
case.
the
letters-of-the-carrier
exception
is
inapplicable
because
there
are
the
union
letters
not
the
appellant's.
the
private
hands
exception
is
inapplicable
because
the
business
relationship
between
the
appellant
and
the
union
indicates
that
the
carriage
would
not
be
without
compensation.
the
opinion
is
joined
by
five
members
of
the
court.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justice
marshall.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
