justice
marshall
will
how
we
decide
this
case
help
me
to
get
my
mail
faster?
justice
marshall
do
you
really
think
so?
justice
marshall
counsel,
it
is
still
not
clear
to
me
how
many
people
use
this
system.
justice
marshall
what
if
a
professor
wants
to
send
a
letter
to
another
professor
down
the
hall?
justice
marshall
it
can
be
mailed
by
the
same
system.
why
do
you
draw
the
line
between
the
professor
and
the
other
people?
justice
marshall
if
a
professor
is
writing
to
another
professor
about
a
third
professor
at
harvard,
that
involves
the
university?
justice
marshall
because
if
you
take
harvard,
i'm
going
to
go
to
oxford.
justice
marshall
what
if
he
asks
him
how
about
his
union
business?
what
does
he
think
of
his
union?
justice
marshall
this
is
to
another
professor?
justice
marshall
i
am
writing
to
you
to
find
out
how
is
joe
droke's
standing
with
the
union.
justice
marshall
isn't
it?
isn't
that
university
business?
