isn't
it
going
to
cost
the
university
some
money
either
way?
justice
white
but
it
will
cost
the
postal
service,
is
that
it?
justice
white
thanks.
of
course,
it
will
also
save
them
a
lot
of
work,
too,
won't
it?
justice
white
employers
who
would
be
in
the
position
of
the
university?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
mr.
wright,
what
authority
does
the
postal
service
have
to
issue
this
regulation?
justice
white
so
you
think
that
authority
to
issue
that
regulation
entitles
the
postal
service
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
some
deference?
justice
white
how
long
has
the
postal
service
interpreted
this
act
that
way?
forever?
justice
white
what
difference
does
that
make
in
interpreting
the
provisions
here?
justice
white
let's
assume
you
accept
the
regulation.
do
you
think
that
this
means
that
these
state
law
provisions
take
these
deliveries
out
of
the
regulation?
justice
white
because
the
employees,
the
recipients,
are
agents
of
the
university?
justice
white
but
in
terms
of
the
regulation.
justice
white
do
you
have
any
cases
that
are
even
close
to
this
case?
justice
white
i
don't
know
whether
they
want
to
do
it
or
not,
but
i
suppose
they
want
to
obey
the
federal
law,
too.
justice
white
what
if
the
university
had
been
convinced
that
they
could
legally
carry
this
and
wanted
to,
but
they
just
happened
to
be
wrong.
what
does
the
postal
service
do?
do
they
sue
somebody
or
what?
justice
white
and
they
have
informed
the
university
here,
haven't
they?
justice
white
so
the
university
has
some
grounds
for
saying,
let's
be
careful.
justice
white
i
haven't
heard
you
argue
yet
that
the
regulation
here
is
invalid.
do
you
argue
that?
justice
white
the
regulation
on
the
letter.
justice
white
so
it
is
a
legitimate
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
white
but
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
interpretation
of
the
regulation?
would
you
then
say
it
is
invalid?
