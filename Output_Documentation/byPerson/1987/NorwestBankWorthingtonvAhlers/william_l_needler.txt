mr.
william
l.
needler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
james
and
maria
ahlers,
farmers
from
fulda,
minnesota,
and
here
on
behalf
of
many
other
farmers
from
all
the
states
in
the
union
who
looked
at
the
ahlers
case
as
a
relief,
a
rock
in
the
middle
of
this
storm.
we
have
upset
the
balance,
says
mr.
conn.
we
have
upset
the
balance
between
the
creditor,
and
the
debtor.
and
yet,
in
the
very
next
case
we
had
with
this
same
farm
credit
system,
they
brag
that
there
has
never
been
a
successful
farmer
reorganization
in
the
district
of
minnesota.
against
that
background
came
the
ahlers
case.
we
went
to
court.
they
had
filed
a
replevin.
they
were
going
take
his
machinery.
we
filed
a
chapter
11.
he
came
to
chicago.
we
filed
that
chapter
11
to
protect
his
assets.
we
immediately
prepared
a
plan
of
reorganization.
we
immediately
prepared
a
disclosure
statement.
we
went
into
the
court
and
we
asked
for
cash
collateral.
under
363
of
the
code
we
requested
living
expenses.
at
the
same
time
we
had
the
relief
of
stay.
we
asked
for
food
to
eat.
we
were
denied.
we
asked
for
food
to
apply
and
run
our
farm.
the
federal
land
bank
system,
our
federal
agency,
our
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
government
if
you
will,
the
one
who
went
to
the
president
last
week
and
got
the
bailout
said
here's
$2,000.00.
so
we
had
$2,000
to
run
our
farm.
they
then
said
to
me,
as
counsel,
give
back
your
retainer,
mr.
needler,
so
that
they
can
eat.
the
retainer
was
not
asked
back.
i
want
you
to
have
some
of
the
background
of
this
case.
this
is
a
serious
farm
case
in
a
district
where
there
were
no
rights.
we
went
to
the
united
states
district
court.
the
opinion
came
out.
i
filed
a
chapter
11.
you
never
should
have
filed,
you
should
have
liquidated.
you
are
the
wrong
attorney.
you
should
not
practice
here.
all
those
things
when
we
went
to
the
united
states
district
court.
we
argued
the
case
up
there.
we
filed
our
brief.
we
said,
we
have
a
plan.
we're
right
in
the
beginning
of
the
case.
we
are
a
chapter
11
debtor.
we
are
a
qualified
farmer.
in
the
hearing
before
the
bankruptcy
court,
mr.
ahlers,
who
is
here
today,
was
on
that
stand
and
testified
as
to
his
income,
as
to
his
crops,
as
to
his
costs.
they
were
irrefuted.
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
did
not
have
$126,000
at
the
end
of
this
period
now
to
reorganize.
the
court
found
there
is
no
evidence
he
can
make
it.
he
can't
make
it.
the
plan
is
not
feasible.
that
is
the
background.
and
we
went
to
the
united
states
district
court.
we
lost
there.
they
came
up
with
some
new
formulas.
there
is
too
much
debt.
since
when
is
a
chapter
11
debtor
precluded
from
filing
chapter
11
or
seeking
reorganization
in
this
united
states
of
america
because
he
has,
quote,
"too
much
debt".
since
when
is
a
chapter
11
debtor
going
to
be
measured
against
a
formula,
if
you
will,
a
formula
proposed
by
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
william
l.
needler
what
is
at
issue
here,
your
honor,
is
one,
the
issue
here
is
a
narrow
one
of
absolute
priority.
he
has
talked
about
the
problems
in
the
lower
court
with
regard
to
adequate
protection.
mr.
william
l.
needler
am
i
going
to
talk
about
those
problems
not
before
the
court?
i
would
be
glad
to
talk
about
them,
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
issue
here.
mr.
william
l.
needler
the
problem
before
the
court
is
whether
the
absolute
priority
rule
which
is
set
forth
in
1129
applies
to
mr.
ahlers
and
mr.
ahlers
and
farmers
in
like
circumstances.
and
we
say
that
does
not
apply.
we
say
that
he
has
the
right
to
reorganize.
if
that
rule
is
applied
to
mr.
ahlers,
then
i
submit
to
you,
gentlemen,
there
is
not
a
farmer
in
the
united
states,
there
is
not
a
small
businessman
in
the
united
states,
who
is
going
to
be
able
to
reorganize
during
this
crisis.
if
creditors
are
going
to
be
allowed
to
use
the
theory
which
is
put
forth
by
mr.
conn
and
the
federal
instrumentality
here
that
mr.
ahlers
has
to
have
fresh
outside
capital,
then
i
submit
there
is
no
fresh
outside
capital
today
for
our
farmers.
this
bill
that
was
signed
by
the
president
last
week
is
not
going
to
give
outside
capital
to
the
mr.
ahlers
and
all
the
farmers.
mr.
william
l.
needler
you
say
congress
has
gotten
around
to
addressing
the
severe
problems?
congress
has
passed
a
chapter
12
bill,
yes.
congress
passed
a
chapter
12
bill
which
restricts
chapter
12(a)
to
all
those
farmers
who
have
never
filed
chapter
11.
(b)
restricts
it
to
those
farmers
who
are
of
a
certain
size
and
stature.
mr.
ahlers
does
not
fit
into
that.
neither
do
many
farmers
in
arizona,
minnesota,
all
over
the
union,
do
not
fit
within
the
chapter
12.
mr.
william
l.
needler
they
are
too
big,
and
the
courts
in
minnesota,
your
honor,
have
already
interpreted
chapter
12
to
say
that
mr.
ahlers,
since
he
is
in
chapter
11
and
already
filed
chapter
11,
could
not
convert.
there
is
some
language
in
the
enabling
clause
of
chapter
12
which
somehow
prevents
him.
other
states,
south
dakota,
north
dakota,
iowa,
kansas,
nebraska,
have
allowed
conversions
of
these
farmers
to
chapter
12,
if
they
fit.
mr.
william
l.
needler
bankruptcy
courts,
district
courts,
have
denied
the
right
of
farmers
like
ahlers
to
convert
to
chapter
12.
chapter
12,
although
promoted
by
senator
grassley,
senator
east
and
the
committee
as
a
help
to
farmers...
it
has
helped;
there
is
no
question.
it
has
helped
the
courts
in
the
philosophy
of
looking
at
farmers.
it
has
assisted.
but
there
are
many
farmers,
your
honors
should
understand,
who
do
not
fit
within
this
category.
there
are
many
farmers
who
need
time.
now,
if
you
remember,
one
of
the
premises
of
chapter
11
was
quote:
"we
need
a
breathing
spell".
we're
going
to
give
them
a
breathing
spell.
we
are
going
to
have
362
to
protect
the
creditor.
be
it
the
farmer,
be
it
wicks
or
be
it
johns
mansville,
362
is
going
to
protect
him.
in
chapter
12,
there
is
no
time.
chapter
12
says
in
90
days
you
are
going
to
file
a
plan
and
you
are
going
to
get
confirmed
right
away.
time,
of
course,
is
needed
by
a
troubled
debtor.
if
he
could
pay
100
cents
on
the
dollar,
like
mr.
conn
suggests,
to
the
unsecured
portion
of
the
unsecured
claim,
he
would
not
be
in
chapter
11
to
start
with.
he
would
not
be
in
bankruptcy.
he
said
this
is
a
bankruptcy
case.
and
i
take
issue
with
that.
this
is
not
a
bankruptcy
case.
this
is
a
reorganization
case
of
a
family
farmer
and
thousands
of
family
farmers
across
this
nation.
if
we
allow
the
creditor
who
holds
a
secured
claim
to
control
the
entire
chapter
11
proceeding,
then
i
think
you
are
going
to
be
doing
something
that
is
inequitable.
mr.
william
l.
needler
thank
you.
we
say
that
the
debtor,
your
honor...
judge
heaney
has
said
that
the
debtor
has
certain
labors
which
have
value,
which
have
measurable
value,
that
mr.
ahlers'
labors
are
measurable.
the
court
can
measure
them.
they
can
determine
how
many
hours
he
works
what
the
rate
would
be
if
you
had
to
replace
mr.
ahlers--
mr.
william
l.
needler
--he
has
promised
to
give
them.
mr.
william
l.
needler
if
mr.
ahlers
confirmed
a
plan
on
a
promise,
justice
scalia,
and
one
month
into
the
plan
he
did
not
delivers
on
the
promise,
then
mr.
conn
could
run
into
court
under
section
11(12)(b)
and
the
case
is
dismissed.
mr.
william
l.
needler
it
works
for
anything.
mr.
william
l.
needler
what
we're
saying
is,
in
answer
to
his
question,
mr.
conn's
question,
is
how
do
we
protect
the
creditor
if
mr.
ahlers
does
not
perform
on
his
promise
of
work
and
the
work
ethic?
mr.
william
l.
needler
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
minute
he
does
not
perform,
the
case
can
be
dismissed
under
the
appropriate
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
mr.
william
l.
needler
and
any
other
promises
under
a
plan.
mr.
william
l.
needler
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
los
angeles
lumber
company
case
indicated
that
if
there
were
substantial
promises
that
were
measurable
in
money
or
money's
worth,
that
would
be
an
exception.
what
judge
heaney
is
saying
is
that
his
labors,
mr.
ahlers'
labors,
and
his
wife's
labors,
are
money
and
money's
worth,
and
can
be
provided
as
an
exception
to
los
angeles
lumber.
and
in
providing
this
labor
and
in
going
forward
with
the
chapter
11
and
the
confirmed
plan,
we
are
going
to
promise
to
pay
unsecured
creditors
100
cents
on
the
dollar.
and
remember
in
this
plan
the
average
farmer...
and
mr.
ahlers
is
the
average
farmer...
there
is
no
equity
for
the
unsecured
creditors.
they
are
going
to
get
zero
under
this
plan.
they
have
no
claim
on
the
assets
that
have
value.
so
what
judge
heaney
has
said
here
will
allow
ahlers
to
reorganize,
will
allow
him
to
go
forward,
and
will
have
in
the
plan
as
part
of
the
plan
that
the
monies
over
and
above
those
needed
for
reorganization
are
to
go
to
pay
off
the
unsecured
creditors.
mr.
william
l.
needler
in
los
angeles
lumber,
as
i
understand
what
the
court
said
there
is,
financial
standing
in
the
community
is
not
measurable.
mr.
william
l.
needler
what
i
am
saying
here
is
with
regard
to
the
ahlers
and
similar
farmers
in
the
united
states,
for
example,
if
they
went
in
to
fulda,
minnesota,
and
let
us
say
he
got
a
job
managing
the
thousands
of
acres
that
the
land
bank
now
has,
and
he
collected
let
us
say
$40,000
a
year
and
he
contributed
that
back
into
the
chapter
11,
that
would
be
money
and
money's
worth.
his
efforts
as
a
farmer
are
measurable.
mr.
william
l.
needler
as
i
read
that
case,
it
was
negligible
things
like
financial
standing
in
the
community,
good
reputation,
those
type
of
things.
we
are
talking
about
hard
work
and
labor
by
the
farmer
over
and
above
what
he
is
taking
out.
the
farmer
here
is
taking
out
$12,000
a
year.
he
is
working
12
hours
a
day,
52
weeks
a
year,
et
cetera.
that
labor
has
a
value.
that
labor
is
far
more
than
the
living
expenses
he
is
taking
out.
judge
heaney
has
said,
let
us
measure
what
commitment
in
dollars
he
is
putting
in.
judge
heaney
says
he
is
putting
in
$28,000
a
year.
mr.
william
l.
needler
justice
scalia,
as
i
read
the
boyd
case,
back
before
the
turn
of
the
century,
the
court
there
said
they
could
propose
income
bonds
or
they
could
propose
preferred
stock.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
income
bond
in
boyd
is
nothing
but
a
pure
promise
to
pay,
based
on
if
there
is
any
income.
what
the
judge
has
said
here
is
that
mr.
ahlers'
labors
are
measurable,
that
they
are
money
and
money's
worth.
for
example,
in
the
farm
community,
as
i
am
sure
you
all
know,
if
i
am
a
farmer,
i
may
trade
my
labors
with
mr.
truax
here.
he
may
pay
me,
he
may
not
pay
me,
he
may
pay
me
by
coming
back
and
working.
there
is
a
barter
situation.
where
there
is
a
portion
of
the
economy
where
there
are
no
credits
available
to
it,
this
becomes
value.
this
is
the
only
value
that
these
farmers
have.
what
we
are
also
saying
in
our
brief
is
that
the
secured
creditor
here
is
voting
his
secured
claim,
through
his
unsecured
claim,
and
in
effect
liquidating
out
all
the
other
merchants
that
are
in
this
case.
the
question
was
asked,
was
there
a
creditors'
committee.
no
there
was
no
creditor's
committee,
because
we
were
right
up
front
in
this
case.
there
was
no
creditors'
committee
to
watch
this
case.
but
the
unsecured
creditors
have
supported
the
ahlers
all
the
way
through
this
case.
there
are
a
whole
series
of
merchants
on
main
street,
other
than
these
federal
land
bank
and
norwest
bank
here.
sure,
their
amount
is
not
as
great
as
the
norwest
bank's
or
the
federal
land
bank's.
but
it
is
a
sizable
amount.
the
creditor
on
main
street,
if
you
allow
the
position
of
the
federal
land
bank
and
the
federal
instrumentality
to
prevail
here,
the
creditor
on
main
street
is
going
to
get
zero.
the
large
secured
creditor
here
is
voting
their
secured
claim
through
their
unsecured
claim
to
defeat
this
reorganization.
that
is
not
what
was
intended
by
the
absolute
priority
rule.
this
is
a
court
of
equity.
and
equity,
we
do
not
think,
allows
one
in
effect
to
vote
one's
claim
against
the
other
creditors.
there
is
a
case
which
i
think
should
be
of
interest
to
your
honors.
and
that
is
the
securities
commission
v.
u.s.
realty,
which
was
a
1940
case
decided
by
this
court.
and
i
would
quote,
on
page
454:
"in
cases
where
subordinate
creditors
of
stockholders
or
managers
of
its
business,
the
preservation
of
going
concern
value
through
their
continued
management
of
the
business
may
compensate
for
reduction
for
reduction
of
claims
of
the
prior
creditors
without
alteration
of
the
managers'
interest.
"
this,
the
dissent
says,
is
an
exception
to
los
angeles
lumber,
an
additional
exception,
and
that
should
apply
to
self-proprietors.
under
the
bankruptcy
code
there
is
a
definition
and
there
is
a
class.
and
that
class
is
in
almost
every
plan,
in
every
corporate
plan,
and
that
is
class
of
equity
security
holders.
nowhere
is
an
individual
debtor
in
that
class.
we
say
that
there
is
no
class
that
is
junior
to
these
creditors
here.
mr.
ahlers
is
not
a
class.
he
owns
the
land.
he
still
own
the
land
and
he's
not
taking
the
land
pursuant
to
this
plan.
so
that
that
is
an
exception
to
1129(b)(2)(b).
to
allow...
and
i
would
quote,
your
honors,
from
this
case
again.
your
own
case
says
that
the
bankruptcy
court
is
a
court
of
equity.
and
the
bankruptcy
court,
in
its
discretion,
in
the
exercise
of
its
jurisdiction,
may
safeguard
the
public
interest.
what
we
are
saying
is
here
that
judge
heaney
has
safeguarded
the
public
interest
here.
he
has
allowed
the
ahlers
and
similar
farmers
to
reorganize,
allowed
them
to
contribute
the
only
thing
that
they
have
to
contribute,
which
is
their
labors,
and
that
that
should
stand
and
that
the
ahlers
should
go
forward
and
be
allowed
to
reorganize.
1129
came
out
of
chapter
10,
which
was
a
corporate
reorganization.
it
did
not
come
out
of
chapter
11.
it
did
not
come
out
of
chapter
12.
when
they
combined
the
code,
they
left
it
in
there.
and
we
say
it
is
in
there,
as
boyd
says,
it
is
to
protect
the
large
corporation
creditors
from
collusion
between
large
corporation
itself
and
the
secured
creditors
to
the
exclusion
of
the
unsecured
creditors.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
the
same
equitable
rule
should
apply
to
protect
the
other
unsecured
creditors
from
the
unscrupulous
activities
of
the
large,
secured
creditors
who
are
willing
for
whatever
reason,
to
get
their
collateral
back,
to
get
the
farm
back,
to
the
detriment
of
all
the
unsecured
creditors.
they
are
voting
their
unsecured
claim
in
an
inequitable
way
to
the
damage
of
all
other
creditors.
if
the
equity
court
of
the
united
states
and
the
bankruptcy
court
and
the
supreme
court
protected
the
unsecured
creditors
against
the
bondholders
and
the
debtor's
activity
in
boyd,
then
why
shouldn't
the
bankruptcy
court
and
this
court
protect
all
the
other
unsecured
creditors
in
this
case
against
the
unscrupulous
activities
of
the
federal
instrumentality
that
is
seeking
to
subvert
the
efforts
of
the
farmer.
what
the
farmer
is
retaining
here,
has
no
present
value.
you
cannot
liquidate
mr.
ahlers'
farm
and
get
anything
to
pay
on
the
unsecured
claim.
we
are
dealing
with
a
valueless
unsecured
claim.
judge
heaney
has
given
it
value,
and
hopefully,
over
time,
ahlers
will
pay
back
his
creditors
100
cents
on
the
dollar.
why
the
creditors
and
the
banks
do
not
stand
behind
us
in
the
ahlers
case,
i
will
never
understand.
if
the
banks
and
the
federal
instrumentality
here
had
thousands
of
ahlers
out
there,
every
day,
paying
off
these
loans,
every
day
making
a
profit,
we
would
not
have
the
financial
crisis
that
we
have
today,
because
these
loans
would
have
value.
you
would
not
need
a
bailout.
now,
at
the
present
time...
i
checked
with
mr.
ahlers
last
night...
he
has
$300,000
in
the
bank.
so
under
this
ahlers
case,
he
has
been
doing
fairly
well.
i
would
point
out
to
your
honors,
under
1129,
and
throughout
the
code,
the
congress
has
put
in
the
words
"includes"
and
"including".
in
1129,
when
we
talk
about
the
provision
that
has
been
called
the
absolute
priority
rule
and
the
fair
and
equitable,
i
would
point
out
to
your
honor
that
the
terms
"include",
"including",
are
put
in
there,
which
to
me,
and
i
think
to
other
people
in
this
business,
mean
that
there
are
other
interpretations
of
this
hard
and
fast
rule.
if
the
hard
and
fast
rule
were
allowed
to
apply,
the
ahlers
could
not
reorganize,
because
they
could
not
pay
off
their
creditors
100
cents
on
the
dollar.
no
farmer
could,
and
none
of
the
businessmen
on
main
street
could,
either.
we
believe
that
the
secured
creditor
is
estopped
here--
mr.
william
l.
needler
--in
1129,
as
it
is
in
363,
as
it
is
in
others,
in
1129(b)(2)
for
the
purpose
of
this
subsection,
the
condition
that
a
plan
be
fair
and
equitable
with
respect
to
a
class
includes
the
following
requirements.
mr.
william
l.
needler
we're
talking
about
1129(b)(2)(b).
mr.
william
l.
needler
by
the
use
of
the
word
"includes",
congress
has
said
this
is
not
the
exclusive
rule.
we
believe
that
by
using
that
term,
congress
meant
to
include
the
back
case
law
in
all
the
other
cases.
it
meant
to
include
boyd,
it
meant
to
include
your
honors'
own
case
of
security
commission
v.
u.s.
realty.
mr.
william
l.
needler
with
respect
to
a
class
of
unsecured
claims,
the
plan
provides
each
holder
of
a
class
to
receive
or
retain
on
account
of
such
claim
property
of
value
as
of
the
effective
date
of
the
plan,
equal
to
the
allowed
amount
of
the
claim.
that
we
cannot
do.
mr.
william
l.
needler
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
l.
needler
or,
the
holder
of
any
claim
or
interest
that
is
junior
to
the
claims
of
such
class.
we
say
that
there
is
no
interest
junior
to
the
class
of
unsecured
creditors
here.
equity
security
interests
in
the
code
are
defined
as
stockholders.
mr.
ahlers
is
not
a
stockholder.
he
is
not
a
class
under
the
plan.
he
is
not
a
class
under
the
plan
that
has
been
filed
here.
he
has
his
property
by
operation
of
law.
when
he
filed
his
chapter
11,
he
was
a
debtor
in
possession.
he
didn't
need
any
other
property
to
give
him
the
property.
it
is
not
like
chapter
10
where
there
is
a
trustee,
the
old
chapter
10,
and
the
trustee
has
the
property.
ahlers
has
the
property.
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
will
not
receive
or
retain
under
the
plan,
on
account
of
such
junior
claim.
he
is
not
retaining
anything
on
account
of
such
junior
claim.
he
already
has
it.
or
interest
in
property.
and
we
think
where
the
word
property
is
used,
it
meant
value.
we
don't
think
this
section
has
to
do
with
the
worthless
value
equity
of
an
individual.
and
we
believe
that
the
history
of
the
chapter
proceedings
of
old
chapter
10,
of
old
chapter
11
and
old
chapter
11
and
12
will
show
that
what
came
into
the
code
was
the
absolute
priority
rule
in
10,
and
that
is
in
here
for
shareholders
and
large
corporations
to
prevent
the
overreaching
in
boyd,
and
is
further
recognized
by
this
court.
it
does
not
apply
to
individual
entrepreneurs,
as
the
exception
is
shown
in
securities
commission
v.
u.s.
realty,
and
should
not
apply
to
the
farmers
who
are
operating
either
as
an
individual
farmer
or
as
an
alter
ego
corporation.
where
we
have
farm
land
with
no
value,
where
we
have
equipment
which
has
far
gone
below
the
value
of
the
loan,
and
these
large,
secured
creditors
are
totally
unsecured
with
their
claim,
it
would
be
a
miscarriage
of
justice
to
allow
those
unsecured
creditors
to
vote
against
this
plan
to
the
detriment
of
the
reorganization
of
all
the
farmers
in
this
country
and
to
vote
their
unsecured
claim
to
basically
allow
them
to
liquidate.
the
farmers
in
this
country
need
help.
the
small
businessman
in
this
country
needs
help.
the
crisis
is
still
out
there.
it
is
on
main
street
of
very
farm
community
in
this
country.
without
a
way
to
reorganize,
you
are
going
to
have
wholesale
liquidations.
this
court,
in
its
opinion
in
securities
v.
u.s.
realty
indicated
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
a
responsibility
to
operate
in
the
public
interest,
has
a
responsibility
to
make
certain
that
debtors
have
an
opportunity
to
reorganize.
the
statute
was
promulgated
originally
because
we
prefer
reorganization
over
liquidation.
your
honors,
in
the
various
decisions
of
this
court
over
the
centuries,
have
indicated
that
liquidations
cause
a
serious
crisis.
the
liquidations
proposed
here
by
the
land
banks
across
the
country
are
going
to
promote
crises.
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
read
in
the
paper,
in
my
opinion,
that
the
situation
has
stabilized,
is
that
because
since
the
ahlers
case,
there
have
been
reorganizations.
in
the
minnesota
district,
the
score
is
not
zero
any
more.
there
are
cases
that
have
been
reorganized.
there
are
numerous
farmers
who
have
reorganized
in
the
district.
as
judge
o'brien
himself
said,
after
this
decision
came
down,
i
have
been
instructed
now
by
the
circuit
to
help
farmers
and
not
usher
them
down
the
tube.
i
am
not
going
to
initially
grant
motions
to
dismiss
as
i
did
before.
and
the
next
case
after
ahlers
was
confirmed
within
a
very,
very
short
time.
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
bargaining
rights
that
have
been
protected
here,
that
ahlers
has
swung
the
pendulum
back
to
the
center,
and
now
that
there
is
bargaining...
there
was
no
bargaining
before.
there
was
liquidation,
liquidation
and
no
confirmation.
the
ahlers
case
is
a
landmark
case.
judge
heaney's
efforts
on
behalf
of
the
farmers
and
all
businessmen
in
the
united
states
are
to
be
commended,
and
his
opinion
has
been
read
far
and
wide.
mr.
william
l.
needler
to
my
knowledge,
i
don't
know
of
anybody
making
new
loans,
but
those
loans
which
they
have
made
have
gone
down.
they
are
advertising,
last
thing
i
knew,
some
4.9
loans.
mr.
william
l.
needler
would
they
be
more
careful
about
making
new
loans?
mr.
william
l.
needler
i
do
not
believe
in
a
free
lunch,
sir.
mr.
william
l.
needler
there
is
no
question
that
the
lending
practices
in
this
country
that
led
up
to
this
disastrous
period
in
the
1970s
and
1980s,
i
am
sure
that
the
lenders
are
not
going
to
repeat.
they
have
been
lending
strictly
on
asset
value
and
they
were
not
looking
at
income
value,
and
they
admit
that.
so
yes,
i
think
with
the
ahlers
case,
and
knowing
that
a
farmer
can
stay
on
the
land,
but
hopefully
pay
off
an
unsecured
portion
100
cents
on
the
dollar,
may
affect
their
lending
practices.
but
i
am
not
so
sure
which
way.
it
might
help
their
lending
practices
to
know
that
if
we
put
a
loan
on
the
books
with
a
farmer
who
has
the
ability
to
pay
and
will
pay
100
cents
on
the
dollar
even
if
he
goes
into
chapter
11,
it
might
even
cause
less
of
an
interest
rate.
mr.
william
l.
needler
what
we
are
saying,
justice
white,
is
that
we
will
pay
them
back
the
asset
value.
judge
heaney
says
we
will
pay
back
the
asset
value
as
of
the
confirmation
date.
that
is
another
important
part
of
this
opinion
that
is
monumental,
because
none
of
us
knew
what
value
when.
judge
heaney
has
said
what
value
when.
he
says
it
is
the
value
on
the
date
of
confirmation.
now,
the
land
values
have
gone
up,
so
now,
the
ahlers
are
going
to
pay
a
higher
price
for
the
land
that
they
keep
under
their
plan,
so
that
this
ruling
has
other
ramifications.
we
are
going
to
pay
whatever
the
value
of
the
land
is
and
then
we
are
hopeful
that
we
are
going
to
have
a
profit
and
we
are
going
to
pay
that
profit
to
unsecured
creditors
over
the
life
of
the
plan,
i
think.
