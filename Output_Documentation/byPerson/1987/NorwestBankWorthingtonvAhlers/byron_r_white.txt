justice
white
so
congress
really
has
gotten
around
to
addressing
these
severe
problems?
justice
white
but
these
banks,
you
say,
loaned
on
asset
value
and
they
should
have
taken
into
consideration
income.
but
all
they
are
insisting
on
is
that
they
have
the
benefit
of
what
they
made
the
loan
on...
namely,
an
asset.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
that
is
on
file,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
case
and
the
opinion
is
otherwise
unanimous.
