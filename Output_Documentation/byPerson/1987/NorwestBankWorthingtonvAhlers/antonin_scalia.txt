justice
scalia
mr.
conn,
you
are
not
arguing,
as
the
government's
amicus
brief
does,
that
even
non-sweat
equity
cannot
be
crammed
down,
are
you?
or
are
you?
justice
scalia
it
is
not
a
formula
proposed
by
united
states
district
court.
it
is
simply
a
question
of
whether
he
has
so
much
debt
that
nobody
is
willing
to
loan
him
money
to
try
to
run
the
business.
isn't
that
what
is
at
issue?
justice
scalia
are
you
going
to
talk
about
those
problems?
justice
scalia
the
problem
before
the
court.
justice
scalia
why
is
that?
are
they
too
big,
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
he
has
not
given
them.
he
has
promised
to
give
them.
right?
justice
scalia
suppose
he
promised
to
give
money?
what
is
the
difference
between
promising
to
give
his
labor
and
promising
to
give
money
in
the
future?
justice
scalia
so
it
works
for
money,
too?
justice
scalia
so
it's
not
just
sweat
equity,
it
is
even
non-sweat
equity?
you
would
say
that
if
the
debtor
comes
in,
the
debtor
who
has
already
defaulted
on
one
promise
to
pay
money,
if
he
comes
in
and
says
i
promise
to
pay
more
money
in
the
future,
the
court
has
to
allow
a
reorganization
on
the
basis
of
that
new
promise?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
and
the
same
with
a
promise
to
give
money.
right?
justice
scalia
okay.
so
you
are
not
just
arguing
sweat
equity,
you
are
arguing
that
you
don't
have
to
put
up
money.
it
is
enough
that
you
promise
to
put
up
money.
and
if
and
when
you
don't
make
good
on
that
promise,
then
we'll
undo
the
reorganization,
but
meanwhile
we
let
it
go.
justice
scalia
he
is
promising
to
put
it
in,
that
is
the
problem.
he
is
not
putting
it
in.
he
is
promising
to
put
it
in.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
no
more
valid
than
his
promise
to
put
in
$200,000.
that
would
not
allow
a
reorganization
to
go
forward.
the
court
would
say,
bring
in
your
$200,000.
put
it
in
the
kitty.
and
then
we
will
go
ahead.
but
the
promise
to
do
it
is
simply
not
the
doing
of
it.
justice
scalia
where
is
this
including
language
that
you
are
referring
to?
justice
scalia
(e)(2),
1129?
justice
scalia
(b)(2).
page
(a)98
of
the
joint
petition.
justice
scalia
it
says
it
includes
the
following
requirements,
one
of
which
is
the
requirement
that
you
assert
need
not
be
observed
here.
the
fact
that
it
may
include
other
requirements
as
well
does
not
mean
that
it
excludes
one
of
the
requirements
that
it
includes.
or
at
least,
not
the
way
i
reason
it.
justice
scalia
but
it
includes
that
requirement,
is
what
the
statute
says.
justice
scalia
that
requirement
is
included.
justice
scalia
have
the
rates
that
the
land
banks
charge
for
new
loans
gone
up?
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
they
will
be
more
careful
about
making
new
loans
if
we
adopt
the
position
that
you
are
urging
us
to
adopt?
justice
scalia
or
do
you
believe
in
a
free
lunch?
justice
scalia
is
it
in
the
interest
of
the
farmer
to
have
a
security
system,
including
a
bankruptcy
system,
that
gives
people
who
are
contemplating
lending
money
enough
security
that
they
will
be
willing
to
lend
the
money
at
a
reasonable
rate?
and
the
less
security
you
give
them,
the
higher
rates
they
are
going
to
ask
for
or
the
less
willing
they
are
going
to
be
to
lend
the
money.
isn't
that
right.
