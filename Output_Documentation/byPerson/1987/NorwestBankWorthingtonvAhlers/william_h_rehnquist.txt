but
on
this
particular
point.

we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.

chief

you
mean
district
courts
in
those
states?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
needles,
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
question.
i
hope
you
will
stop
long
enough
to
answer
it.
the
question
on
which
we
granted
certiorari
is:
do
the
absolute
priority
provisions
of
section
1129
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
11
u.s.c.
1129,
this
court's
decision
in
case
v.
los
angeles
lumber
products
company,
prohibit
confirmation
of
a
debtor's
proposed
reorganization
plan
under
the
circumstances
given
there?
i
hope
you
will
address
that
question
sometime
during
the
half
an
hour
allotted
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
needler,
in
los
angeles
lumber,
which
i
take
it
you
say
is
still
applicable
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
old
business
management
law,
the
promise
they
would
continue,
they
had
financial
standing
in
the
community.
and
justice
douglas'
opinion
for
the
court
said
that
we
will
not
permit
valueless
junior
interests
to
participate
their
position
in
an
enterprise
on
such
ephemeral
grounds.
how
does
your
client's
position
differ
from
the
people
in
los
angeles
lumber?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
a
willingness
to
continue
to
work
in
the
business.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
so
were
the
managers
of
los
angeles
lumber
measurable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
needler.
mr.
conn,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
you
have
to
convince
all
of
them?
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
majority
of
each
class?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
conn.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
