justice
stevens
mr.
conn,
can
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
get
into
the
main
part
of
your
argument?
your
clients
are
partially
secured
creditors
and
they
are
also
partially
general
creditors,
because
they
are
undersecured,
is
the
way
it
works
out.
justice
stevens
and
i
take
there
probably
were
some
general
creditors
who
had
no
secured
interest
at
all.
was
there
a
creditors'
committee
or
something?
did
they
have
a
position
in
the
litigation,
the
creditors?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
