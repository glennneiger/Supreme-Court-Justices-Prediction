mr.
gordon
b.
conn,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
bankruptcy
case
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
case
involves
the
so-called
11
reorganization
proceedings.
the
issue
on
which
this
court
has
granted
review,
slightly
paraphrased,
is
whether
a
chapter
11
debtor,
in
this
case
a
farmer,
may
cram
down
a
plan
of
reorganization
over
the
objections
of
unpaid
creditors,
where
the
creditors
will
not
be
paid
out
under
the
plan,
but
where
the
debtor
will
retain
all
his
property
in
exchange
for
a
promise
in
the
future
to
contribute
his
labor,
experience
and
expertise
in
the
business
operation
of
the
organization.
the
court
of
appeals,
by
a
divided
panel
decision,
held
in
favor
of
the
debtor
on
this
issue.
in
doing
so,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
factual
findings
of
both
the
bankruptcy
court
and
the
district
court,
regarding
the
lack
of
adequate
protection
for
the
secured
creditors'
interest
in
the
property,
and
also
regarding
the
feasibility
of
reorganization
of
this
particular
debtor.
the
panel
decision
held
that
a
chapter
11
reorganization
of
this
debtor
in
this
case
would
be
feasible,
notwithstanding
the
opposite
finding
by
the
district
court.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
reorganization
would
be
feasible
because
number
one,
the
debtor
in
this
case
would
have
no
present
obligation
to
provide
adequate
protection
of
his
secured
creditors'
interests
in
collateral,
thereby
freeing
up
funds
for
reorganization
that
would
otherwise
need
to
be
used
to
pay
adequate
protection,
and
number
two,
that
reorganization
would
be
feasible
because
the
debtor
could
overcome
what
is
known
as
the
11
u.s.c.
section
1129
(b),
previously
reflected
in
this
court's
decisions
in
case
v.
los
angeles
lumber,
and
others,
that
the
"absolute
priority"
rule
could
be
overcome
by
the
debtor's
promising
in
the
plan
to
devote
his
future
labor,
experience
and
expertise
to
the
reorganized
operation.
the
essence
of
it
is
that,
notwithstanding
the
statute,
and
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
a
bankruptcy
debtor
under
this
decision
may
retain
property
by
a
future
promise
of
working
without
paying
his
creditors.
the
case
arises
out
of
the
following
general
facts:
the
petitioners
are
creditors
of
the
debtor
who
in
this
case
is
a
farmer.
the
petitioners
include
the
federal
land
bank
of
st.
paul
and
norwest
bank
of
worthington.
the
land
bank's
interest
began
in
about
1965
when
it
made
various
real
estate
loans
to
mr.
ahlers,
and
the
interests
of
norwest
bank
worthington
arose
in
about
1982
when
that
bank
extended
various
operating
loans,
all
secured
by
second
mortgages
on
real
estate,
and
by
security
interests
in
other
collateral.
the
debtors'
borrowings
from
these
two
institutions
amounted
to
in
the
neighborhood
of
$1
million.
by
late
1984,
the
debtors'
were
in
serious
default
under
their
loans
and
filed
for
protection,
under
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
shortly
following
that
filing
the
land
bank
and
norwest
promptly
moved
for
relief
from
the
bankruptcy
automatic
stay
under
section
362(d)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
to
permit
foreclose
of
their
mortgages
and
security
interests.
at
this
time,
i
think
it
is
common
knowledge,
the
farm
economy,
particularly
in
the
midwest,
was
in
a
troubled
state
and
secured
creditors
in
particular
were
seeing
the
values
of
their
collateral
diminish.
land
values
in
particular
had
declined
sharply
and
were
continuing
on
the
downside.
indications,
justice
white,
are
that
the
corner
may
have
been
turned,
i
believe.
mr.
gordon
b.
conn,
jr.
there
may
be
some
dispute
about
that.
in
seeking
relief
from
the
stay
to
permit
foreclosure,
the
two
creditors
here
moved
both
to
lift
the
stay
for
lack
of
adequate
protection
of
their
interests
in
the
collateral
under
section
362
(d)(1),
and
also
moved
for
relief
from
stay
under
section
362
(d)(2),
which
provides
for
relief
from
stay
where
the
debtor
has
no
equity
in
the
property,
and
the
property
in
question
is
not
necessary
for
an
effective
reorganization.
in
moving
under
this
latter
section,
the
petitioners
took
the
position
that
the
property
was
not
necessary
for
an
effective
reorganization,
because
the
debtors'
financial
condition
was
so
desperate
that
no
reorganization
could
in
any
instance
be
feasible
in
this
case.
the
bankruptcy
court
granted
relief
from
the
stay,
holding
that
adequate
protection
was
required
to
protect
petitioners'
interest
in
the
property
and
that
the
debtors'
officers
of
adequate
protection
were
not
sufficient
to
provide
that
protection.
accordingly,
the
bankruptcy
court
ordered
that
the
automatic
stay
be
lifted
to
permit
the
creditors
to
foreclose
their
interest.
the
district
court
affirmed
and
the
debtor
then
sought
relief
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
stay
the
effect
of
the
orders
of
the
lower
court.
the
court
of
appeals
did
stay
the
orders,
pending
appeal,
and
also
directed,
in
connection
with
one
of
those
interim
orders,
that
the
district
court
undertake
a
specific
examination
of
the
feasibility
of
reorganization
for
these
debtors.
the
district
court
did
so,
and
in
an
opinion
included
in
our
appendix,
the
district
court
undertook
an
analysis
of
the
debtors'
financial
operations
and
projections
from
the
bankruptcy
court
file
and
concluded
that
the
debtors'
situation
was
so
dire
that
there
was
utter
unfeasibility
of
reorganization.
the
matter
then
went
back
to
the
eighth
circuit,
and
on
that
further
appeal,
in
a
divided
panel
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
lower
court's
holding
that
no
adequate
protection
was
required
as
to
the
real
estate
because
of
a
timing
issue
that
would
hold
under
the
applicable
state
law
that
no
protection
would
be
required
for
a
year
and
six
weeks,
thereby
freeing
up
substantial
funds
for
use
by
the
debtor
while
retaining
the
property,
and
number
two,
and
this
is
the
issue
involved
in
this
proceeding,
that
reorganization
of
this
debtor
would
be
feasible,
despite
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
the
basis
on
which
the
panel
decision
found
that
reorganization
would
be
feasible,
which
i
will
address
in
more
detail
in
a
moment,
was
that
the
debtor,
despite
not
being
able
to
pay
creditors
in
a
plan
of
reorganization,
should
nonetheless
be
allowed
to
retain
all
the
property
under
a
plan
in
exchange
for
the
debtors'
willingness
to
provide
work
over
the
years
of
the
plan,
which
might
or
might
not
result
in
some
additional
payment
to
creditors
that
would
not
be
received
in
a
liquidation.
following
that
decision,
the
petitioners
moved
for
rehearing
with
a
suggestion
for
rehearing
en
banc.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
five
to
four
vote
in
favor
of
rehearing,
but
rehearing
was
nonetheless
denied
because
of
lack
of
an
absolute
majority
of
the
judges
on
the
eighth
circuit.
the
tenth
judge
had
recused
himself
from
participation
because
of
prior
representation
of
the
land
bank.
petitioners
then
sought
relief
in
this
court
through
the
petition
for
certiorari,
on
three
grounds:
number
one,
the
lack
of
adequate
protection;
two,
the
en
banc
question;
and
three,
the
absolute
priority
issue,
which
his
sometimes
described
as
the
sweat
equity
issue.
the
certiorari
was
granted
as
to
the
absolute
priority
issue.
we
believe
in
this
proceeding
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
issue
is
in
error
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
gordon
b.
conn,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
gordon
b.
conn,
jr.
i
am
not
specifically
sure,
justice
stevens.
the
amount
of
unsecured
creditors
who
were
not
in
this
dual
position,
as
are
the
two
banks,
was
very,
very
small.
i
believe
the
total
indebtedness
reflected
there
was
something
like
$70,000
as
compared
to
$500,000
in
the
unsecured
portion
of
the
petitioners.
to
my
knowledge,
those
other
creditors
have
been
inactive
throughout
the
proceedings.
mr.
gordon
b.
conn,
jr.
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
panel
is
error,
basically
for
three
reasons.
first,
allowing
the
retention
of
property
by
a
debtor
without
satisfying
objecting
creditors
in
full
is
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
the
relevant
portion
of
the
statute.
the
relevant
portion
is
11
u.s.c.
section
1129
(b)(2)(b).
second,
to
the
extent
that
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
on
the
absolute
priority
issue
survive
enactment
of
the
1978
bankruptcy
code,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
clearly
contrary
to
the
rule
of
law
announced
in
case
v.
los
angeles
lumber,
the
boyd
case,
and
several
others
previously
announced
by
this
court.
finally,
and
from
a
broader
perspective,
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
seriously
upsets
the
balance
of
rights
and
remedies
and
bargaining
mix,
if
you
will,
that
congress
established
in
enacting
the
1978
bankruptcy
code,
and
in
doing
so,
unfairly
expands
the
so-called
cram
down
power
of
debtors
to
the
severe
detriment
of
creditors.
on
the
first
point,
which
i
think
is
the
clearest,
that
is,
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
gordon
b.
conn,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
difficulty
with
that
position.
there
is
a
substantial
attraction
to
the
bright
line
test
that
is
suggested
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
that
would
avoid
any
difficulty
of
valuing
new
contributions
by
former
owners.
in
reviewing
the
legislative
history
of
the
absolute
priority
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
i
am
frankly
not
on
certain
whether
congress
intended
totally
to
abrogate
the
prior
rule
of
los
angeles
lumber.
i
would
have
to
say
that
there
does
not
appear
at
least
to
me
to
be
a
specific
intent
to
overrule
prior
case
law.
however,
what
does
appear
to
me,
in
reviewing
that
legislative
history,
is
that
there
was
clearly
no
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
in
any
way
expand
whatever
exception
there
might
have
been
to
absolute
priority
under
those
cases.
i
think
the
contrary
is
true,
and
that
can
be
seen
by
the
fact
that
in
defining
the
term
"fair
and
equitable"
out
of
which
the
absolute
priority
rule
had
evolved
in
judicial
decisions,
congress
chose
expressly
to
define
"fair
and
equitable"
to
exclude
the
retention
of
property
without
full
payment
of
senior
creditors.
mr.
gordon
b.
conn,
jr.
the
bankruptcy
code
went
much
further
in
favor
of
debtors
in
several
cases.
mr.
gordon
b.
conn,
jr.
not
on
this
point.
in
fact,
the
key
point
on
that,
your
honor,
is
that
when
the
tulsa
revision
of
the
bankruptcy
laws
was
proposed
by
the
bankruptcy
commission,
there
was
recognition
that
there
were
some
special
difficulties
for
individual
debtors
and
there
was
recognition
that
maybe
the
rule
of
los
angeles
lumber
of
this
court
was
too
harsh.
the
commission
suggested
that
the
laws
be
amended
to
relax
the
absolute
priority
rule
in
general
to
allow
equity
participation
by
former
owners,
and
in
particular
to
allow
participation
by
individuals,
after
a
period
of
time
in
a
plan.
congress,
by
enacting
the
1978
code,
expressly
did
not
follow
those
recommendations
of
the
commission.
instead,
what
congress
did
was
to
enact
the
specific
provisions
in
1129(b)(2)(b)
which
expressly
state
that
a
debtor
cannot
retain
property
under
a
plan
over
the
objection
of
his
creditors
without
satisfying
those
prior
claims
in
full
under
the
plan.
the
absolute
priority
rule,
which
is
codified
now
in
the
statute,
has
something
of
a
harsh
ring
to
it,
and
indeed,
the
very
language
of
it
is
by
its
terms,
absolute.
in
commenting
on
that,
i
would
like
to
observe
that
in
what
i
perceive
at
least
to
be
the
real
world
of
bankruptcy,
it
does
not
work
that
way.
under
the
1978
bankruptcy
code,
in
order
to
confirm
a
plan
of
reorganization,
a
debtor
need
not
invariably
satisfy
that
absolute
priority
rule,
which
was
the
case
under
the
earlier
case
law
of
case
v.
los
angeles
lumber
company,
where
that
rule
had
to
be
satisfied
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
creditors
favored
allowing
participation.
under
the
1978
bankruptcy
code,
all
a
debtor
needs
to
do
to
overcome
the
absolute
priority
rule,
is
to
convince
his
creditors
that
they
will
fare
better
in
a
reorganization
in
which
the
debtor
retains
an
interest
than
they
would
in
a
liquidation.
this
is
part
of
the
mix
of
bargaining
rights
that
i
believe
was
established
by
congress
under
the
code
and
it
is
only
in
a
rare
situation
where
a
debtor
is
either
unable
or
unwilling
to
make
a
satisfactory
offer
to
his
creditors
that
the
issue
of
cram
down
comes
into
play
or
that
the
veto
power
of
the
absolute
priority
rule
if
you
will,
comes
into
play.
in
the
briefs
submitted
by
the
respondents
and
their
amicus
curiae
supporters,
there
seems
to
be
an
argument
made
that
the
absolute
priority
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
somehow
should
make
a
distinction
between
individual
debtors
and
corporate
debtors,
such
that,
while
it
is
appropriate
to
apply
the
absolute
priority
rule
to
prevent
shareholders
of
a
corporation
from
retaining
equity
interest,
it
is
somehow
not
appropriate
to
apply
that
rule
where
the
debtor
is
an
individual.
i
think
the
response
to
that
argument
is
twofold.
first,
the
plain
language
of
the
absolute
priority
rule
in
the
statute
does
not
admit
of
any
distinction
between
individual
and
corporate
debtors.
throughout
the
bankruptcy
code,
it
is
clear
that
when
congress
chosen
to
deal
with
particular
needs
of
particular
classes
of
debtors,
it
has
done
so.
for
example,
only
individuals
can
exempt
certain
property
from
the
estate
under
section
522.
only
individuals
can
avoid
liens
on
exempt
property
under
that
same
section.
only
individuals
are
entitled
to
a
complete
discharge
of
debt
under
section
727.
only
farmers
are
immune
from
involuntary
bankruptcy
cases
under
section
03.
in
addition,
congress
has
made
special
provisions
for
individuals
and
farmers
in
chapters
12
and
13.
i
think
the
implication
is
fairly
clear,
that
had
congress
chosen
to
do
so,
in
the
absolute
priority
rule,
it
could
have.
indeed,
that
was
specifically
suggested
by
the
bankruptcy
commission,
and
was
not
enacted
by
congress.
the
decision
below
looks
around,
i
think,
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
and
seeks
to
rely
on
this
court's
decision
in
case
v.
los
angeles
lumber
for
support
for
the
notion
that
a
debtor
may
in
effect
buy
into
a
reorganization
thorough
a
promise
of
future
work
or
service.
with
all
respect,
i
think
that
the
ruling
in
case
v.
los
angeles
lumber
is
to
the
contrary
and
does
not
support
the
position
of
the
panel
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
fact,
the
los
angeles
lumber
case
reversed
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
which
allowed
equity
owners'
retention
of
equity
interests
in
a
bankruptcy
where
the
consideration,
if
you
will,
for
that
retention
was
their
future
management
standing
in
the
community
and
the
like.
that
is
very
close,
i
think,
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
below
in
this
case,
and
case
v.
los
angeles
lumber
simply
doesn't
support
it.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
what
the
respondents
and
their
amicus
supporters
strive
to
do
here,
is
to
fit
this
sweat
equity
notion
within
the
apparent
exception
of
case
v.
los
angeles
lumber
that
would
have
allowed
existing
shareholders
to
participate
in
a
reorganization
in
exchange
for
an
infusion
of
new
capital.
the
argument
goes
that
because
the
debtor
in
this
case
will
agree
to
provide
services
in
the
future,
that
is
the
equivalent
of
new
capital
for
the
operation
and
therefore
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
absolute
priority
rule
to
allow
the
debtor
to
retain
all
interest
in
the
property.
there
are
several
problems
with
that.
first,
it
would
apply
in
virtually
any
chapter
11
case
involving
an
individual
debtor
because
obviously
it
is
implicit
in
any
individual
reorganization
that
the
individual
intends
to
keep
working
the
business.
the
next
argument
that
is
made
by
the
respondents
is
that
the
debtor
really
would
not
be
retaining
anything
here,
because
what
is
being
retained
is
of
no
value.
the
debtor
has
no
equity
in
the
property,
therefore
it
is
valueless,
therefore
it
is
not
a
retention.
the
problem
with
that
analysis
is
that
obviously,
there
is
some
going
concern
value
here,
or
the
parties
would
not
have
been
litigating
over
it
for
the
last
three
years.
this
"no
value"
theory
is,
as
i
read
the
attorney
general's
amicus
brief,
not
endorsed
by
them.
it
is
rejected
by
professor
nimmer's
article
on
which
they
rely.
and
with
the
exception
of
the
star
city
rebuilders
case,
i
believe
that
"no
value"
argument
has
been
rejected
by
every
lower
court
to
consider
it.
the
next
argument
they
make
is
that
by
agreeing
to
provide
future
services,
the
debtor
is
injecting
new
value
to
the
organization
which
would
enable,
in
effect,
the
purchase
the
property
over
the
objection
of
the
creditors.
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
the
promise
to
provide
future
services
is
really
nothing
new.
it
is
implicit
in
the
original
loan.
any
time
i
take
out
a
loan
for
my
business,
implicit
in
my
promise
to
repay
is
that
i
am
going
to
work
in
the
business
to
generate
funds
to
repay.
what
is
happening
in
this
situation
is
that
the
debtor
is
seeking
to
have
the
level
of
debt
structured
down
in
bankruptcy
and
then
saying
okay,
now
i
am
going
to
promise
to
repay
this
lower
debt
by
working
the
business,
which
is
precisely
what
the
original
promise
implied.
in
that
context,
there
is
nothing
new.
secondly,
on
that
same
point,
the
notion
that
the
debtor's
services
are
providing
consideration
for
buying
the
assets
in
substantial
part
involves
bootstrapping.
the
return
on
use
of
this
property
is
going
to
come
from
the
debtor's
use
of
the
land,
equipment,
other
cash
collateral
which
is
subject
to
the
creditor's
claims.
only
a
portion
of
whatever
funds
could
be
generated
are
solely
attributable
to
the
debtor's
own
services,
and
therefore,
again
it
is
not
new
value.
finally,
the
exception,
if
that
is
what
it
is,
in
angeles
lumber,
speaking
about
allowing
equity
holders
to
buy
in
through
a
capital
infusion,
is
clearly
that
the
capital
infusion
must
be
in
money
or
money's
worth.
now,
the
difficulty
with
the
lower
court's
decision
in
ahlers
is
that
an
unenforceable
promise
to
provide
future
services
is
not
a
current
asset.
as
in
los
angeles
lumber,
it
is
not
an
item
that
can
be
put
on
the
balance
sheet
of
the
business
organization.
it
has
no
present
value
for
liquidation
purposes.
in
short,
it
does
not
enhance
the
estate
for
creditors
at
all.
if
the
plan
fails,
the
promise
of
the
debtor
to
work
in
the
future
does
not
give
the
creditors
unpaid
any
further
rights
than
they
would
have
had
before,
and
therefore,
it
is,
i
believe,
a
totally
illusory
obligation.
finally,
and
i
think
in
the
broader
context
here,
the
difficulty
with
what
ahlers
does
in
the
overall
context
of
the
bankruptcy
code
is
that
it
severely
upsets
the
relative
bargaining
positions
between
the
debtor
on
the
one
hand
and
the
creditors
on
the
other.
it
gives
a
very
strong
tool
to
debtors
in
virtually
ever
case
involving
an
individual
reorganization,
which
is
a
far
departure
from
what
at
least
i
believe
congress
had
in
mind.
the
real
upshot
of
ahlers
is
that,
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
which
contemplated
that
a
secured
creditor
should
be
able,
if
criteria
were
met,
to
obtain
a
decision
on
a
lift
stay
motion
within
30
days
after
making
that
motion,
and
if
the
stay
were
not
lifted
that
the
creditor
would
receive
protection
of
its
interest
during
the
duration
of
the
bankruptcy
case
that
has
been
turned
upside
down
by
the
ahlers
decision.
what
has
been
seen
in
this
case
is
that
the
petitioners,
who
started
out
as
secured
creditors
and
now
hold
dual
roles,
have
been
precluded
for
three
years
from
enforcing
their
rights
in
collateral,
which
has
probably
been
declining
during
the
interim,
and
they
are
now
confronted,
if
the
ahlers
were
upheld,
with
seeing
their
debts
restructured
at
decision
lower
level
and
proceeding
over
a
longer
period
with
continuing
risk
to
ride
with
the
debtor.
now,
on
policy
arguments,
one
can
argue
that
that
might
be
an
appropriate
approach
to
attempting
to
assist
the
troubled
farm
economy.
the
response
to
that
is,
that
is
precisely
what
congress
has
done,
or
attempted
to
do,
in
enacting
chapter
12
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
responses
to
these
problems
as
perceived
are
invariably
legislative
responses
rather
than
calling
for
changing
dramatically
the
provisions
of
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
i
think
that
congress,
through
chapter
12,
and
the
various
state
legislatures
through
their
farm
mediation
acts
and
the
like,
have
demonstrated
an
ability
to
address
that
problem,
and
i
believe
that
the
effort
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
it
by
judicial
means
is
inappropriate.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
gordon
b.
conn,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
agree
with
mr.
needler
that
the
ahlers
decision
has
sweeping
ramifications.
it
has
had
substantial
ramifications
in
the
eighth
circuit,
and,
to
a
lesser
degree,
elsewhere.
among
the
problems
with
the
lower
court's
decision
in
ahlers
is
that
it
is
not
limited
or
limitable
to
the
perceived
problems
with
agriculture,
but
rather,
it
is
equally
applicable
in
any
chapter
11
reorganization
proceeding.
it
has
substantially
altered,
as
judge
gibson
said
in
dissent,
substantially
altered
the
relationship
between
debtor
and
creditor
and
it
is
far
beyond
anything
that
congress
intended.
with
respect
to
the
voting
question
raised
by
mr.
needler,
that
the
creditors
should
somehow
be
estopped
from
voting
against
whatever
plan
is
proposed,
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
bankruptcy
code
specifically
provides
that
a
secured
creditor
who
becomes
undersecured
is
treated
as
an
unsecured
creditor
for
the
balance
of
its
claim
and
is
entitled
to
the
same
voting
rights
as
any
other
unsecured
creditor.
and
if
those
creditors
control
the
group
of
unsecured
creditors,
in
amount
and
number,
they
have
the
absolute
right
to
vote.
the
absolute
priority
rule
is
by
its
terms,
absolute.
that
has
been
the
law
for
close
to
100
years
and
was
not
changed
by
congress
in
1978.
if
anything,
it
was
strengthened.
the
tradeoff,
however,
is
that
the
rule,
although
absolute,
can
now
under
the
new
law
be
waived
by
creditors.
therefore,
all
that
is
incumbent
on
a
debtor
is
to
convince
his
creditors
that
they
will
fare
better
under
a
plan
of
reorganization
that
leaves
property
in
the
hands
and
management
of
the
debtor
than
they
would
under
a
liquidation.
if
in
a
case
where
a
liquidation
would
produce
zero
for
the
unsecured
creditors,
if
the
debtor
can
convince
those
creditors
that
they
will
get
something
by
voting
in
favor
of
a
plan.
mr.
gordon
b.
conn,
jr.
it
goes
by
class,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
b.
conn,
jr.
i
believe
it
is
two
thirds
in
dollars
and
a
majority
in
number,
within
each
class.
if
that
agreement
can
be
reached,
reorganization
can
go
forward
without
any
need
to
pay
off
100
cents
on
the
dollar.
the
absolute
priority
rule
exists
for
the
protection
of
creditors
where
they
either
are
not
offered
anything
of
value
by
the
debtor
or
they
have
no
confidence
in
the
debtor's
ability
to
perform
under
whatever
promises
are
made.
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
congress
did
not
change
it.
it
tightened
it.
and
until
the
ahlers
case
came
along,
it
has
no
been
subject
to
any
serious
question.
thank
you.
