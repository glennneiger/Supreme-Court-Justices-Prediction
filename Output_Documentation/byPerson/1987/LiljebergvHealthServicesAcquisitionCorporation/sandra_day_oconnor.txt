justice
o'connor
mr.
farr,
how
does
subsection
(c)
enter
into
this.
it
says
that
the
judge
should
inform
himself
about
his
personal
and
fiduciary
financial
interests,
and
make
a
reasonable
effort,
and
so
forth.
does
that
enter
into
the
picture
at
all?
justice
o'connor
well,
then
what
about
the
hypothetical
that
you
were
asked
about
the
spouse
owning
shares
of
stock,
i
mean
he
deals
with
a
case
involving
that
company,
do
you
not
think
that
(c)
suggests
that
he
should
know
that
his
wife
owns
the
stock?
justice
o'connor
but
in
the
case
of
other
than
this
one
then,
do
you
concede
that
(c)
affects
(a)
in
the
sense
at
least
to
the
extent
that
the
judge
is
supposed
to
inform
himself
about
his
own
personal
interests?
justice
o'connor
was
there
a
finding
that
he
did
comport
with
his
duties
under
(c)
in
this
case?
