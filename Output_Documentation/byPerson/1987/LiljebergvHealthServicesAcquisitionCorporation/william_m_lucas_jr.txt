mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
the
single
most
important
finding
of
fact
by
the
fifth
circuit
was
its
finding
that
the
public
would
not
believe
the
judge
collins
forgot.
if
the
public
would
not
believe
that
judge
collins
forgot,
it
would
therefore
believe
that
his
impartiality
might
reasonably
be
questioned.
and
it
would
therefore
believe
that
the
judgment
was
tainted.
and
the
requirements
of
455(a)
would
then
have
been
met.
and
that
was
basically,
i
believe,
the
foundation
of
the
fifth
circuit's
holding.
the
fifth
circuit
also
said
that
the
judge
erred
in
failing
to
recuse
himself.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
i
believe
that
the
public
would
question
his
impartiality,
yes.
if
the
public
knew
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
board
then.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
the
public,
i
believe,
for
purposes
of
455(a)
is
presumed
to
know
objective
facts.
the
objective
facts
were
that
before
that
hearing
and
during
that
trial,
this
man,
this
judge,
was
a
member
of
the
board
of
trustees
of
loyola
university.
at
that
time,
the
public
is
expected
to
know
that,
yes.
i
do
not
think
that
it
matters
when
he
learned
it,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
that
the
public
is
deemed
to
know
every
little
detail,
and
that
is
where
the
importance
comes
in.
i
think
that
the
public
is
to
know
that
if
loyola
owns
a
530
acre
tract
of
land,
which
is
what
this
is,
the
equivalent
of
about
seventeen
square
city
blocks,
that
if
it
is
going
to
sell
a
piece
of
that
land
and
it
is
going
to
have
rezoned
115
acres
around
it
which
will
increase
the
value
by
$9
million,
i
think
those
facts
that
the
public
would
expect
to
be
important
and
would
know.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
well,
then,
too,
maybe
the
court
is
guilty
of
not
having
revealed
it,
as
it
is
required
to
do
and
mandated
to
do.
when
it
knew
it,
it
did
not
tell
the
parties.
it
did
not
tell
the
attorneys.
i
do
not
think
that
under
those
circumstances
that
we
should
look
back
and
say.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
scalia,
that
if
a
judge
could
just
keep
to
himself
some
interest
that
would
require
his
recusal
under
455(a),
if
he
could
just
keep
it
to
himself
under
after
the
judgment
is
rendered,
all
is
well.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
justice
scalia,
we
do
not
say
that
he
did
not
know.
the
judge
himself
said
that
he
did
not
remember.
he
knew
on
january
24,
1980.
the
court
found
that
as
a
finding
of
fact.
he
knew
on
september
25,
1981.
he
knew
on
november
12,
1981,
and
that
is
an
important
date.
because
on
that
date,
he
attended
a
meeting,
and
he
voted
on
a
motion
that
was
passed
unanimously
or
presumably
he
voted.
he
was
there,
and
the
motion
passed
unanimously,
to
resume
negotiations
with
mr.
liljeberg.
eighteen
days
later,
the
suit
was
filed.
and
twenty-nine
days
later,
he
denied
a
tro
and
refused
a
stay
and
injunction
that
suit,
twenty-nine
days
after
that
meeting.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
and
lost
on
the
merits.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think.
i
think
that
what
is
before
the
court
is
the
fifth
circuit,
judge
collins
particularly
saying
that
he
did
not
remember.
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between
he
did
not
remember
and
he
did
not
know.
he
did
know
initially.
now
we
are
in
the
area
of
did
he
know
and
then
forget.
that
is
really
what
we
are
saying.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
we
found
out,
sir,
ten
months
after
the
judgment
was
rendered
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
loyola
was
not
a
party
to
the
suit,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
it
was
not
involved.
it
was
not
involved
in
the
suit.
the
suit
was
over
the
ownership
of
a
corporation,
which
in
turn
owned
a
certificate
of
need
to
build
a
hospital,
a
hospital
which
was
going
to
be
built
if
mr.
liljeberg
was
successful
on
loyola
property.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
on
which
it
would
be
built;
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
did
not
even
know
of
any
connection
between
loyola
and
mr.
liljeberg.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
sir.
did
not
know
of
any
connection
between
mr.
liljeberg
and
loyola.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
am
perhaps
not
making
myself
clear.
i
had
no
reason
to
look
at
loyola's
minutes.
because
loyola
was
not
a
party
to
the
suit,
and
i
have
no
idea
at
that
time
that
a
hospital
would
be
built
on
loyola's
property.
it
could
have
been
built
anywhere.
so
there
was
no
reason
to
suspect.
loyola
played
no
part
in
this
case.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
i
can
see
impropriety
in
the
fact
that
the
judge
knew
on
march
24th,
two
days
before
he
lost
jurisdiction
of
this
case,
and
did
not
inform
anyone
and
did
not
tell
anyone.
he
had
a
mandatory
duty
to
recuse
himself
at
that
point.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
sir,
it
did
not.
the
discovery
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
you
mean?
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
sir,
it
did
not.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
where
the
hospital
was
going
to
be
built
was
really
of
no
concern.
you
see,
this
was
a
contest
between
hsac,
which
is
a
subsidiary
of
hospital
corporation
of
america,
and
mr.
liljeberg,
who
was
negotiating
with
other
companies.
hsac
had
land
on
which
to
build
the
hospital,
and
which
the
state
had
approved
the
site
for
the
hospital.
so
where
the
hospital
was
going
to
be
built
was
really
of
no
concern
to
us,
even
if
mr.
liljeberg
won.
we
were
concerned
with
him
not
winning.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
well,
again,
looking
back
on
it,
a
number
of
things
could
have
happened.
number
one,
the
judge
on
his
own
motion
under
rule
59
could
have
declared
a
new
trial
right
then
and
there.
on
the
night
of
march
25th,
the
last
date,
on
march
25th
of
1982,
the
last
date
that
it
was
still
under
judge
collins'
jurisdiction,
he
attended
a
meeting
at
which
the
details,
the
details
of
this
land
transaction
were
discussed.
those
minutes
are
before
your
honors.
no
phone
calls,
certainly
not
to
me,
and
certainly
not
to
anyone
else
that
i
know
about,
to
say,
even
on
march
26th,
27th,
or
28th,
hey,
i
hear
you
are
appealing
this
case,
i
think
that
you
ought
to
know.
and
the
onus
is
not
on
the
lawyers,
your
honors,
as
i
read
the
statute
and
jurisprudence.
the
onus
is
on
the
judge.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no.
except,
of
course,
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
raised
is
the
question,
the
opposing
counsel's
question
is
timeliness.
and
of
course,
it
is
directly
involved
there.
we
were
in
a
position
where
it
was
ten
months
after
the
court
ruled.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
the
merits?
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that
they
are,
sir.
i
think
so,
sir.
now
one
of
the
points
that
this
court,
of
course,
is
well
aware
of
is
that
a
judge
should
not
act
as
a
judge
in
his
own
case.
and
this
court
in
aetna
v.
lavoie
established
that
principle.
also
the
law
does
not
look
at
just
actual
bias,
but
it
looks
at
the
question
of
the
appearance
of
bias
or
the
appearance
of
impropriety.
and
this
was
an
important
holding
by
the
court
in
the
commonwealth
coatings
case
back
in
1968.
in
fact,
it
was
that
case
that
was
used
as
a
source
of
455(a)
in
the
senate
and
house
hearings.
therefore,
in
the
absence
of
a
designation
of
a
remedy
in
section
455,
the
remedy
applied
by
this
court
in
commonwealth
coatings
is
reasonable.
i
was
asked
before
at
the
earlier
hearing
as
to
the
basis
for
any
remedy
under
455.
and
i
think
that
the
basis
for
that
remedy
is
the
commonwealth
coatings
case.
i
do
not
think
that
i
or
anyone
else
will
ever
know
what
is
only
known
to
judge
collins.
i
think
that
a
terrible
situation
would
face
this
court
and
this
nation
under
this
statute
if
we
ever
got
into
a
position
where
a
judge
stands
in
the
position
of
the
person
being
tried.
and
i
would
cite
the
court
to
u.s.
v.
brown
in
the
purview
of
a
fair
trial,
that
it
is
the
judge
himself
who
is
on
trial.
if
we
ever
get
to
a
situation
where
the
judge
can
say
i
forgot
or
i
do
not
remember
and
completely
exculpate
himself
from
any
finding
of
impartiality,
then
i
think
that
we
would
do
violence
under
those
circumstances
to
the
congressional
intent
of
455(a).
i
think
that
the
cases
have
clearly
established
that
we
must
rely
upon
on
objectively
ascertainable
evidence
rather
than
the
judge's
memory
or
the
judge's
professing
of
not
remembering.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
we
get
back
to
the
question
of
is
it
a
little
thing
or
is
it
a
big
thing.
here,
it
was
a
big
thing.
here,
it
was
a
case
of
a
judge
who
attended
three
meetings
where
this
matter
was
discussed
apparently
in
detail.
and
the
suggestion
has
made
that
he
only
heard
it
one,
or
two,
or
three
times.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
but
i
believe
that
it
is
presumed
that
the
public
knew
whatever
the
facts
were
at
that
time,
not
later.
whether
the
public
finds
out
later
or
not
is
inconsequential.
so
we
look
at
the
facts
at
that
time.
the
facts
at
that
time
were
that
he
had
any
number
of
meetings
and
he
got
any
number
of
minutes.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
i
think
that
is
it.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
that
never
entered
the
case,
and
that
is
another
point.
presumably,
he
was
negotiating
for
quite
awhile,
as
later
developed
at
depositions
taken
after
the
motion
to
vacate
was
filed,
yes.
that
was
never
revealed
to
us.
he
was
negotiating
the
whole
time.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
the
trial
was
january
21
and
22;
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
i
do
not
know.
obviously,
they
were
keeping
track
of
the
case.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
yes.
but
again,
i
must
stress
the
fact
that
we
did
not
know.
when
i
say
we,
hsac
did
not
know
of
loyola's
connection
with
this
proceeding
until
ten
months
after
the
court
of
appeals,
the
u.s.
fifth
circuit.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
one
thing
that
i
think
also
is
very
worthy
of
consideration.
and
that
is
that
455
applies
to
criminal
cases
as
well
as
applying
to
civil
cases.
i
think
that
if
we
were
to
give
the
interpretation
that
petitioners
wish
to
give
to
455,
then
in
u.s.
v.
brown,
the
defendant
would
still
be
in
jail,
or
at
least
he
would
have
served
out
his
sentence.
because
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
a
great
impropriety
in
that
case,
the
judgment
had
already
been
rendered.
it
was
some
time
eight
years
later
between
the
time
that
the
man
was
tried
and
the
time
of
the
reversal.
he
would
still
be
in
jail.
because
it
was
not
a
case
of
actual
bias,
he
could
not
proceed
that
way.
it
was
a
remark
that
the
judge
made
that
did
not
come
to
light
until
after
the
trial,
four
years
i
believe
it
was
after
the
trial
was
over.
so
if
we
give
the
construction
to
this
statute
that
once
judgment
is
rendered
that
that
is
it,
or
once
an
appeal
is
exhausted
that
that
is
it,
then
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
an
injustice
in
the
criminal
field
as
well
as
the
civil
could
well
take
place.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
i
confess
that
i
am
out
of
my
field
when
we
are
talking
about
criminal
law.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
this
judge
in
effect
acted
as
a
judge
in
his
own
case,
once
simply
by
saying
i
do
not
remember
or
i
forget
is
taken
as
the
basis
for
saying
that
he
would
not
be
responsible
under
455(a).
to
the
contrary,
the
fifth
circuit
finding
that
the
public
would
not
believe
that
he
was
impartial
said
that
he
because
of
constructive
knowledge,
things
that
he
should
have
known,
that
he
had
a
duty
to
inquire
into,
justice
o'connor,
under
(c),
requires
that
he
be
found
to
have
had
the
requisite
knowledge
to
indicate
his
impartiality
under
455(a).
the
record
clearly
establishes
that
justice
collins
attended
board
meetings
on
these
three
occasions
that
i
mentioned.
again
i
wish
to
particularly
stress
the
november
21,
1981
board
meeting,
twenty-nine
days
before
he
ruled
on
a
preliminary
matter
in
this
case,
which
you
will
find
on
page
one
of
the
joint
appendix,
within
twenty-nine
days.
we,
and
when
i
say
we,
the
members
of
the
public
have
to
ask
ourselves
if
we
were
on
a
board
of
trustees
that
was
getting
ready
to
sell
a
piece
of
property
that
had
discussed
at
a
number
of
meetings
that
we
attended,
that
was
one
of
the
principal
assets
of
this
institution
that
we
serve,
and
the
surrounding
land
was
going
to
be
increased
in
value
by
$9
million,
and
we
voted
on
the
motion
to
renew
the
negotiations
with
these
people,
liljeberg
and
st.
jude,
would
be
twenty-nine
days
later
remember
that.
i
think
that
we
would.
and
i
think
that
under
that
construction,
that
the
court
properly
found
that
the
public
would
not
believe
judge
collins
forgot.
thus,
it
is
not
a
question
really
of
whether
he
knew
or
he
did
not
know,
or
whether
he
forgot
or
he
did
not
forget.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
the
public
would
find
that
based
upon
the
relevant
objective
facts
that
it
appeared
that
the
judge
was
not
impartial.
from
the
beginning,
this
court
has
said
that
justice
must
satisfy
the
appearance
of
justice.
and
that
the
imprimatur
must
be
placed
on
a
sound
judicial
system
that
has
the
support
of
the
people.
and
i
believe
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
455(a).
455(a)
is
not
to
be
applied
in
a
speculative
manner,
not
just
any
situation.
not
just
something,
justice
scalia,
that
it
seems
to
me
involves
something
quite
minor
should
be
used
to
try
to
set
aside
a
judgment.
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
that
was
the
meaning
that
was
ever
intended
to
be
given
to
it.
but
in
a
situation
of
extreme
facts,
strong
facts,
compelling
facts,
as
we
have
in
this
case,
that
is
the
only
vehicle
by
which
we
can
preserve
our
right
to
a
fair
trial,
if
you
will,
a
fair
trial
in
a
fair
tribunal,
which
after
all
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
the
single
most
important
finding
of
fact
by
the
fifth
circuit
was
its
finding
that
the
public
would
not
believe
the
judge
collins
forgot.
if
the
public
would
not
believe
that
judge
collins
forgot,
it
would
therefore
believe
that
his
impartiality
might
reasonably
be
questioned.
and
it
would
therefore
believe
that
the
judgment
was
tainted.
and
the
requirements
of
455(a)
would
then
have
been
met.
and
that
was
basically,
i
believe,
the
foundation
of
the
fifth
circuit's
holding.
the
fifth
circuit
also
said
that
the
judge
erred
in
failing
to
recuse
himself.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
i
believe
that
the
public
would
question
his
impartiality,
yes.
if
the
public
knew
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
board
then.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
the
public,
i
believe,
for
purposes
of
455(a)
is
presumed
to
know
objective
facts.
the
objective
facts
were
that
before
that
hearing
and
during
that
trial,
this
man,
this
judge,
was
a
member
of
the
board
of
trustees
of
loyola
university.
at
that
time,
the
public
is
expected
to
know
that,
yes.
i
do
not
think
that
it
matters
when
he
learned
it,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
that
the
public
is
deemed
to
know
every
little
detail,
and
that
is
where
the
importance
comes
in.
i
think
that
the
public
is
to
know
that
if
loyola
owns
a
530
acre
tract
of
land,
which
is
what
this
is,
the
equivalent
of
about
seventeen
square
city
blocks,
that
if
it
is
going
to
sell
a
piece
of
that
land
and
it
is
going
to
have
rezoned
115
acres
around
it
which
will
increase
the
value
by
$9
million,
i
think
those
facts
that
the
public
would
expect
to
be
important
and
would
know.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
well,
then,
too,
maybe
the
court
is
guilty
of
not
having
revealed
it,
as
it
is
required
to
do
and
mandated
to
do.
when
it
knew
it,
it
did
not
tell
the
parties.
it
did
not
tell
the
attorneys.
i
do
not
think
that
under
those
circumstances
that
we
should
look
back
and
say.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
scalia,
that
if
a
judge
could
just
keep
to
himself
some
interest
that
would
require
his
recusal
under
455(a),
if
he
could
just
keep
it
to
himself
under
after
the
judgment
is
rendered,
all
is
well.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
justice
scalia,
we
do
not
say
that
he
did
not
know.
the
judge
himself
said
that
he
did
not
remember.
he
knew
on
january
24,
1980.
the
court
found
that
as
a
finding
of
fact.
he
knew
on
september
25,
1981.
he
knew
on
november
12,
1981,
and
that
is
an
important
date.
because
on
that
date,
he
attended
a
meeting,
and
he
voted
on
a
motion
that
was
passed
unanimously
or
presumably
he
voted.
he
was
there,
and
the
motion
passed
unanimously,
to
resume
negotiations
with
mr.
liljeberg.
eighteen
days
later,
the
suit
was
filed.
and
twenty-nine
days
later,
he
denied
a
tro
and
refused
a
stay
and
injunction
that
suit,
twenty-nine
days
after
that
meeting.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
and
lost
on
the
merits.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think.
i
think
that
what
is
before
the
court
is
the
fifth
circuit,
judge
collins
particularly
saying
that
he
did
not
remember.
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between
he
did
not
remember
and
he
did
not
know.
he
did
know
initially.
now
we
are
in
the
area
of
did
he
know
and
then
forget.
that
is
really
what
we
are
saying.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
we
found
out,
sir,
ten
months
after
the
judgment
was
rendered
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
loyola
was
not
a
party
to
the
suit,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
it
was
not
involved.
it
was
not
involved
in
the
suit.
the
suit
was
over
the
ownership
of
a
corporation,
which
in
turn
owned
a
certificate
of
need
to
build
a
hospital,
a
hospital
which
was
going
to
be
built
if
mr.
liljeberg
was
successful
on
loyola
property.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
on
which
it
would
be
built;
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
did
not
even
know
of
any
connection
between
loyola
and
mr.
liljeberg.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
sir.
did
not
know
of
any
connection
between
mr.
liljeberg
and
loyola.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
am
perhaps
not
making
myself
clear.
i
had
no
reason
to
look
at
loyola's
minutes.
because
loyola
was
not
a
party
to
the
suit,
and
i
have
no
idea
at
that
time
that
a
hospital
would
be
built
on
loyola's
property.
it
could
have
been
built
anywhere.
so
there
was
no
reason
to
suspect.
loyola
played
no
part
in
this
case.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
i
can
see
impropriety
in
the
fact
that
the
judge
knew
on
march
24th,
two
days
before
he
lost
jurisdiction
of
this
case,
and
did
not
inform
anyone
and
did
not
tell
anyone.
he
had
a
mandatory
duty
to
recuse
himself
at
that
point.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
sir,
it
did
not.
the
discovery
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
you
mean?
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
sir,
it
did
not.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
where
the
hospital
was
going
to
be
built
was
really
of
no
concern.
you
see,
this
was
a
contest
between
hsac,
which
is
a
subsidiary
of
hospital
corporation
of
america,
and
mr.
liljeberg,
who
was
negotiating
with
other
companies.
hsac
had
land
on
which
to
build
the
hospital,
and
which
the
state
had
approved
the
site
for
the
hospital.
so
where
the
hospital
was
going
to
be
built
was
really
of
no
concern
to
us,
even
if
mr.
liljeberg
won.
we
were
concerned
with
him
not
winning.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
well,
again,
looking
back
on
it,
a
number
of
things
could
have
happened.
number
one,
the
judge
on
his
own
motion
under
rule
59
could
have
declared
a
new
trial
right
then
and
there.
on
the
night
of
march
25th,
the
last
date,
on
march
25th
of
1982,
the
last
date
that
it
was
still
under
judge
collins'
jurisdiction,
he
attended
a
meeting
at
which
the
details,
the
details
of
this
land
transaction
were
discussed.
those
minutes
are
before
your
honors.
no
phone
calls,
certainly
not
to
me,
and
certainly
not
to
anyone
else
that
i
know
about,
to
say,
even
on
march
26th,
27th,
or
28th,
hey,
i
hear
you
are
appealing
this
case,
i
think
that
you
ought
to
know.
and
the
onus
is
not
on
the
lawyers,
your
honors,
as
i
read
the
statute
and
jurisprudence.
the
onus
is
on
the
judge.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no.
except,
of
course,
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
raised
is
the
question,
the
opposing
counsel's
question
is
timeliness.
and
of
course,
it
is
directly
involved
there.
we
were
in
a
position
where
it
was
ten
months
after
the
court
ruled.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
the
merits?
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that
they
are,
sir.
i
think
so,
sir.
now
one
of
the
points
that
this
court,
of
course,
is
well
aware
of
is
that
a
judge
should
not
act
as
a
judge
in
his
own
case.
and
this
court
in
aetna
v.
lavoie
established
that
principle.
also
the
law
does
not
look
at
just
actual
bias,
but
it
looks
at
the
question
of
the
appearance
of
bias
or
the
appearance
of
impropriety.
and
this
was
an
important
holding
by
the
court
in
the
commonwealth
coatings
case
back
in
1968.
in
fact,
it
was
that
case
that
was
used
as
a
source
of
455(a)
in
the
senate
and
house
hearings.
therefore,
in
the
absence
of
a
designation
of
a
remedy
in
section
455,
the
remedy
applied
by
this
court
in
commonwealth
coatings
is
reasonable.
i
was
asked
before
at
the
earlier
hearing
as
to
the
basis
for
any
remedy
under
455.
and
i
think
that
the
basis
for
that
remedy
is
the
commonwealth
coatings
case.
i
do
not
think
that
i
or
anyone
else
will
ever
know
what
is
only
known
to
judge
collins.
i
think
that
a
terrible
situation
would
face
this
court
and
this
nation
under
this
statute
if
we
ever
got
into
a
position
where
a
judge
stands
in
the
position
of
the
person
being
tried.
and
i
would
cite
the
court
to
u.s.
v.
brown
in
the
purview
of
a
fair
trial,
that
it
is
the
judge
himself
who
is
on
trial.
if
we
ever
get
to
a
situation
where
the
judge
can
say
i
forgot
or
i
do
not
remember
and
completely
exculpate
himself
from
any
finding
of
impartiality,
then
i
think
that
we
would
do
violence
under
those
circumstances
to
the
congressional
intent
of
455(a).
i
think
that
the
cases
have
clearly
established
that
we
must
rely
upon
on
objectively
ascertainable
evidence
rather
than
the
judge's
memory
or
the
judge's
professing
of
not
remembering.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
we
get
back
to
the
question
of
is
it
a
little
thing
or
is
it
a
big
thing.
here,
it
was
a
big
thing.
here,
it
was
a
case
of
a
judge
who
attended
three
meetings
where
this
matter
was
discussed
apparently
in
detail.
and
the
suggestion
has
made
that
he
only
heard
it
one,
or
two,
or
three
times.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
but
i
believe
that
it
is
presumed
that
the
public
knew
whatever
the
facts
were
at
that
time,
not
later.
whether
the
public
finds
out
later
or
not
is
inconsequential.
so
we
look
at
the
facts
at
that
time.
the
facts
at
that
time
were
that
he
had
any
number
of
meetings
and
he
got
any
number
of
minutes.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
i
think
that
is
it.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
that
never
entered
the
case,
and
that
is
another
point.
presumably,
he
was
negotiating
for
quite
awhile,
as
later
developed
at
depositions
taken
after
the
motion
to
vacate
was
filed,
yes.
that
was
never
revealed
to
us.
he
was
negotiating
the
whole
time.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
the
trial
was
january
21
and
22;
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
i
do
not
know.
obviously,
they
were
keeping
track
of
the
case.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
yes.
but
again,
i
must
stress
the
fact
that
we
did
not
know.
when
i
say
we,
hsac
did
not
know
of
loyola's
connection
with
this
proceeding
until
ten
months
after
the
court
of
appeals,
the
u.s.
fifth
circuit.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
one
thing
that
i
think
also
is
very
worthy
of
consideration.
and
that
is
that
455
applies
to
criminal
cases
as
well
as
applying
to
civil
cases.
i
think
that
if
we
were
to
give
the
interpretation
that
petitioners
wish
to
give
to
455,
then
in
u.s.
v.
brown,
the
defendant
would
still
be
in
jail,
or
at
least
he
would
have
served
out
his
sentence.
because
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
a
great
impropriety
in
that
case,
the
judgment
had
already
been
rendered.
it
was
some
time
eight
years
later
between
the
time
that
the
man
was
tried
and
the
time
of
the
reversal.
he
would
still
be
in
jail.
because
it
was
not
a
case
of
actual
bias,
he
could
not
proceed
that
way.
it
was
a
remark
that
the
judge
made
that
did
not
come
to
light
until
after
the
trial,
four
years
i
believe
it
was
after
the
trial
was
over.
so
if
we
give
the
construction
to
this
statute
that
once
judgment
is
rendered
that
that
is
it,
or
once
an
appeal
is
exhausted
that
that
is
it,
then
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
an
injustice
in
the
criminal
field
as
well
as
the
civil
could
well
take
place.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
i
confess
that
i
am
out
of
my
field
when
we
are
talking
about
criminal
law.
mr.
william
m.
lucas,
jr.
this
judge
in
effect
acted
as
a
judge
in
his
own
case,
once
simply
by
saying
i
do
not
remember
or
i
forget
is
taken
as
the
basis
for
saying
that
he
would
not
be
responsible
under
455(a).
to
the
contrary,
the
fifth
circuit
finding
that
the
public
would
not
believe
that
he
was
impartial
said
that
he
because
of
constructive
knowledge,
things
that
he
should
have
known,
that
he
had
a
duty
to
inquire
into,
justice
o'connor,
under
(c),
requires
that
he
be
found
to
have
had
the
requisite
knowledge
to
indicate
his
impartiality
under
455(a).
the
record
clearly
establishes
that
justice
collins
attended
board
meetings
on
these
three
occasions
that
i
mentioned.
again
i
wish
to
particularly
stress
the
november
21,
1981
board
meeting,
twenty-nine
days
before
he
ruled
on
a
preliminary
matter
in
this
case,
which
you
will
find
on
page
one
of
the
joint
appendix,
within
twenty-nine
days.
we,
and
when
i
say
we,
the
members
of
the
public
have
to
ask
ourselves
if
we
were
on
a
board
of
trustees
that
was
getting
ready
to
sell
a
piece
of
property
that
had
discussed
at
a
number
of
meetings
that
we
attended,
that
was
one
of
the
principal
assets
of
this
institution
that
we
serve,
and
the
surrounding
land
was
going
to
be
increased
in
value
by
$9
million,
and
we
voted
on
the
motion
to
renew
the
negotiations
with
these
people,
liljeberg
and
st.
jude,
would
be
twenty-nine
days
later
remember
that.
i
think
that
we
would.
and
i
think
that
under
that
construction,
that
the
court
properly
found
that
the
public
would
not
believe
judge
collins
forgot.
thus,
it
is
not
a
question
really
of
whether
he
knew
or
he
did
not
know,
or
whether
he
forgot
or
he
did
not
forget.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
the
public
would
find
that
based
upon
the
relevant
objective
facts
that
it
appeared
that
the
judge
was
not
impartial.
from
the
beginning,
this
court
has
said
that
justice
must
satisfy
the
appearance
of
justice.
and
that
the
imprimatur
must
be
placed
on
a
sound
judicial
system
that
has
the
support
of
the
people.
and
i
believe
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
455(a).
455(a)
is
not
to
be
applied
in
a
speculative
manner,
not
just
any
situation.
not
just
something,
justice
scalia,
that
it
seems
to
me
involves
something
quite
minor
should
be
used
to
try
to
set
aside
a
judgment.
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
that
was
the
meaning
that
was
ever
intended
to
be
given
to
it.
but
in
a
situation
of
extreme
facts,
strong
facts,
compelling
facts,
as
we
have
in
this
case,
that
is
the
only
vehicle
by
which
we
can
preserve
our
right
to
a
fair
trial,
if
you
will,
a
fair
trial
in
a
fair
tribunal,
which
after
all
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
