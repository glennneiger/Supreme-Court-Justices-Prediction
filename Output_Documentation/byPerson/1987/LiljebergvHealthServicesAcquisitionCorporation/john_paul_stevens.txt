justice
stevens
mr.
farr,
can
i
interrupt
you.
if
you
draw
the
line
at
when
the
judgment
was
entered.
can
you
refresh
my
recollection,
what
was
the
date
on
which
this
judgment
was
entered?
justice
stevens
and
what
was
the
date
when
he
found
out
about
the
possible
appearance
of
impropriety
arising?
justice
stevens
and
my
question
is
what
in
your
view
was
the
trial
judge's
duty
under
the
statute
at
that
point
in
time?
justice
stevens
and
what
would
you
say
if
a
motion
had
been
made
on
say
the
26th
or
27th
of
march,
whatever
the
dates
were?
justice
stevens
that
it
was
too
late?
justice
stevens
and
if
he
had
happened
to
open
his
mail
three
of
four
days
earlier.
i
guess
that
there
were
just
a
couple
of
days
before
he
got
those
letters.
and
that
would
have
been
a
critical
difference
too,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
mr.
farr,
is
that
not
the
very
point
of
the
appearance
of
impropriety,
that
the
public
really
does
not
know
exactly
what
the
judge's
state
of
mind
was,
or
whether
he
remembered,
or
deliberately
forgot
or
what.
and
the
appearance
concept
is
designed
to
take
care
of
in
part
of
public
perceptions
of
act
when
you
do
not
in
fact
until
months
later
have
a
finding
of
fact
that
he
did
not
actually
know.
justice
stevens
on
a
what
kind
of
standard?
i
did
not
understand.
justice
stevens
would
you
say
that
455(a),
which
i
think
is
the
relevant
provision
here,
can
never
be
violated
if
the
judge
is
not
aware
of
a
disqualifying
fact.
judges
do
this.
they
have
portfolios
of
stock,
and
they
forget
that
they
own
a
hundred
shares
of
some
stock,
but
the
newspapers
check
this
up.
would
you
say
that
there
was
no
violation
of
that
section,
if
the
judge
has
honestly
forgot
about
it,
if
there
was
no
appearance
of
impropriety?
justice
stevens
yes.
but
under
your
view,
as
i
understand
you,
you
really
will
not
know
whether
there
was
an
appearance
of
impropriety
until
you
have
had
a
finding
of
fact
on
the
judge's
state
of
knowledge.
justice
stevens
well,
i
am
not
disagreeing
with
you
that
that
is
not
true,
but
that
is
a
little
different
from
one's
normal
concept
of
what
an
appearance
of
impropriety
is.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
appearance
either
exists
or
it
does
not
exist,
and
sometimes
there
is
a
wholly
innocent
explanation
for
it.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
does
not
really
affect
the
public
perception.
the
public
sometimes
is
suspicious
of
us,
even
though
they
really
should
not
be.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
farr,
the
facts
that
give
rise
to
the
violation
of
455(a),
if
there
was
a
violation
of
455(a),
would
exist
before
the
finding
occurred.
whereas
the
ones
that
you
described
depend
on
whether
the
statement
was
made,
which
is
an
objective
fact
yes
or
no.
what
you
in
effect
are
saying
is
that
later
on
you
want
to
know
the
subjective
state
of
mind
of
the
judge
here
to
determine
whether
there
is
an
appearance.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
appearance
might
well
have
existed,
even
though
he
did
not
realize
that
there
was
a
disqualifying
fact.
justice
stevens
is
it
your
position
that
455(a)
was
not
violated,
or
that
the
vacation
of
a
judgment
is
an
impermissible
remedy
for
a
violation
of
455(a)?
justice
stevens
it
is
both.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
along
that
line,
mr.
lucas,
something
that
has
always
puzzled
me.
in
the
minutes
of
the
january
22nd
meeting.
what
was
the
date
of
the
trial,
it
was
right
at
about
the
time?
justice
stevens
the
minutes
of
the
real
estate
committee
on
january
22
refer
to
the
negotiations
with
st.
jude
hospital
corporation,
and
that
mr.
eckholdt
report
that
the
federal
courts
have
determined
that
the
certificate
of
need
will
be
awarded
to
the
st.
jude
corporation.
that
quite
obviously
refers
to
the
judge's
oral
rule
from
the
bench
in
this
case.
but
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
tells
us
how
the
loyola
trustees
came
to
be
aware
of
that
fact?
justice
stevens
or
whether
they
perhaps
warned
the
judge
that
he
should
not
be
sitting
in
a
case
like
this
or
anything
like
that?
justice
stevens
that
did
not
come
out
in
discovery?
justice
stevens
the
loyola
people
were
keeping
track
of
the
case?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
if
you
apply
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
in
a
criminal
case
to
determine
whether
the
judge
in
fact
knew
of
the
biasing
factor,
do
you
not
think
that
you
would
have
to
apply
a
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard?
justice
stevens
if
there
is
more
than
a
fifty
percent
chance
that
the
judge
was
not
biased,
we
are
going
to
let
the
person
go
to
jail.
i
doubt
that.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it
was
called
to
his
attention
very
much
more
promptly
than
eighteen
months.
justice
stevens
do
you
not
agree
at
that
point
that
he
had
a
duty
to
do
something
more
than
he
did?
justice
stevens
do
you
not
think
that
he
had
a
duty
to
do
something
more
than
he
did?
justice
stevens
you
do
not
think
that
he
had
a
duty
to
disclose
to
the
parties
what
the
true
facts
were?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that
everybody
knows
that
it
would
have
been
better.
if
it
just
would
have
been
better,
then
you
are
saying
that
he
had
no
duty
to
disclose
at
that
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
requires
that
we
consider
section
455
of
the
judicial
code,
which
deals
with
the
disqualification
of
federal
judges.
subsection
(a)
of
that
section
requires
that
a
judge
disqualify
himself
in
any
proceeding
in
which
his
impartiality
might
reasonably
be
questioned.
applying
this
standard,
we
conclude
today,
as
did
the
court
of
appeals,
that
a
violation
of
455(a)
is
established
if
a
reasonable
person,
knowing
the
relevant
facts
would
expect
that
the
presiding
judge
knew
of
circumstances
creating
an
appearance
of
partiality
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
judge
was
actually
conscious
of
the
circumstances.
the
relevant
inquiry
under
subsection
(a)
is
not
whether
or
not
the
judge
was
actually
biased
but
whether
he
or
she
appeared
biased.
we
also
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
was
appropriate
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
accordingly,
where
reason
spelled
out
in
an
opinion
we
filed
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
white
and
justice
scalia
joined
and
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
