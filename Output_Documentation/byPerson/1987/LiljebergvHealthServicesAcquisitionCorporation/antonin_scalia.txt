justice
scalia
i
mean
"might
well",
he
would
have
knowledge,
would
he
not?
justice
scalia
wait
a
minute.
let
us
suppose
in
this
case
that
he
is
a
big
booster
for
loyola
and
has
been,
and
everybody
in
town
knows
that
he
is
a
trustee
of
loyola.
and
this
is
a
big
case
and
the
caption
is
loyola
versus
somebody
else.
and
he
for
some
very
strange
reason
forgets
that
he
is
a
trustee,
and
he
continues
to
sit
in
that
case.
do
you
not
think
that
that
would
create
an
appearance
of
impropriety.
the
only
reason
that
i
thought
that
you
could
argue
that
there
was
not
one
here
is
that
the
impropriety
did
not
at
all
consist
about
the
fact,
that
is
was
very
hidden,
even
the
other
side
did
not
realize
that
this
land
or
that
this
company
had
a
bid
in
on
land,
and
if
the
company
went
under
that
the
land
would
not
be
bought
by
that
company,
and
that
the
land
belonged
to
loyola.
i
can
understand
that
that
is
no
appearance
of
impropriety,
because
the
public
at
large
would
not
know
that.
but
the
other
example
that
i
just
gave
you,
would
that
not
be
an
appearance
of
impropriety?
justice
scalia
it
is
my
hypothetical.
i
mean
there
is
a
determination
that
he
did
not
know
about
it.
justice
scalia
then
there
is
no
appearance
of
impropriety?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
that
would
show
that
he
should
disqualify
himself
in
any
proceeding
in
which
his
impartiality
might
reasonably
have
been
questioned.
and
this
says
might
reasonably
be
questioned.
the
proceeding
was
over.
at
the
time
that
it
was
conducted,
there
was
no
reason
for
the
public
to
question
his
impartiality.
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
public
will
not
believe
that
his
colleagues'
finding
that
he
did
not
know
about
it
was
true
later.
justice
scalia
the
public
did
not
know.
but
the
public
did
not
know.
at
the
time
of
the
proceeding,
even
the
parties
did
not
know,
who
were
much
more
familiar
with
all
of
the
land
involved
in
the
case
and
all
of
that.
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
the
public
would
have
known.
justice
scalia
the
public
is
deemed
to
know
every
little
detail,
even
though
he
is
unaware
of
those
details,
and
even
though
he
has
no
obligation
to
inform
himself
of
those
details?
justice
scalia
the
public
did
not
know
the
connection
between
this
company
and
that
land
any
more
than
the
judge
here
did.
do
you
seriously
contend
that
at
the
time
that
the
judgment
was
rendered
that
there
was
an
appearance
of
impropriety?
justice
scalia
there
was.
to
whom
was
this
appearance
manifest,
since
your
client
did
not
find
out
about
it
until
how
much
later?
maybe
you
are
guilty
of
laches
then.
justice
scalia
because
then
he
would
come
under
another
provision
where
he
has
personal
bias
or
prejudice,
or
where
he
actually
knows
of
a
financial
interest.
but
here,
you
are
just
saying
that
he
did
not
know
of
it.
i
mean
that
is
quite
different.
here
you
are
saying
that
this
judgment
was
bad,
because
it
appeared
that
he
was
biased.
and
i
find
it
hard
to
say
that
at
the
time
of
the
judgment
that
there
was
any
appearance
of
impropriety.
justice
scalia
you
tried
this
and
lost,
did
you
not?
justice
scalia
did
you
not
argue
this
to
the
district
court?
justice
scalia
and
lost
on
the
merits.
justice
scalia
we
do
not
want
to
try
that
again
here.
do
we
not
have
to
accept
the
fact
that
he
did
not
know,
is
that
not
the
posture
in
which
this
case
is
going
forward?
justice
scalia
you
no
more
than
the
general
public
had
any
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
any
impropriety.
i
mean
that
seems
to
me
very
telling.
and
yet
you
assert
that
there
was
an
appearance
of
impropriety,
although
you
did
not
see
any.
justice
scalia
that
might
be
actual
bias
or
actual
impropriety,
but
it
would
not
be
an
appearance
of
impropriety,
which
is
what
i
thought
that
we
were
talking
about.
the
discovery
did
not
disclose
that
st.
jude
was
negotiating
with
loyola
as
a
prospective
seller
of
the
land?
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
mr.
lucas,
such
a
holding
would
not
stretch
as
far
as
you
are
suggesting.
i
mean
if
the
thing
that
he
claims
not
to
have
remembered
is
something
obvious
to
all
of
the
public
and
he
is
the
only
one
in
the
world
who
did
not
remember,
then
you
could
say
whether
he
remembered
it
or
not,
that
there
was
an
appearance
of
impropriety,
because
the
whole
public
knew
that
this
land
was
involved
in
litigation
and
that
he
was
a
trustee
of
loyola.
but
it
is
a
much
narrower
situation
when
you
say
that
it
is
a
little
thing
that
the
public
would
not
know
about,
and
that
it
is
that
he
claims
not
to
remember.
what
is
so
bad
about
letting
that
be
adjudged
by
a
separate
court.
and
if
the
court
is
persuaded
that
he
did
not
remember
it,
there
has
neither
been
an
appearance
of
impropriety
nor
any
actual
impropriety.
justice
scalia
well,
you
are
mistaking
what
i
mean
by
a
little
or
big
thing.
i
mean
a
thing
that
is
evident
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
this
was
not
evident
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
your
client
did
not
pick
it
up.
it
was
a
very
remote
connection.
now
maybe
he
should
have
remembered
it,
but
he
did
not,
or
at
least
it
was
found
that
he
did
not.
justice
scalia
i
think
that
is
the
essence
of
what
we
are
debating
about
here.
whether
you
use
what
the
public
reasonably
knew
at
the
time,
or
what
ever
detail
of
the
fact
was
at
the
time.
i
think
that
you
are
right
that
if
you
say
that
that
is
the
basis
on
which
you
do
it,
then
there
was
an
appearance
of
impropriety.
