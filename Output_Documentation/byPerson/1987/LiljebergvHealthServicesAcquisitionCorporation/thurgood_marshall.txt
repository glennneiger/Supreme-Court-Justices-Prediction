justice
marshall
you
are
not
ignoring
appearances,
are
you?
justice
marshall
everybody
but
him.
justice
marshall
i
know,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
appearances
are
there.
justice
marshall
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
mention.
there
were
minutes
of
all
of
these
meetings.
justice
marshall
which
he
was
supposed
to
have
read.
justice
marshall
anybody
in
the
public
assumes
that
a
trustee
reads
the
minutes.
justice
marshall
how
can
you
convince
the
public
of
that,
that
a
judge
does
not
understand
what
he
is
reading?
justice
marshall
well,
did
he
in
this
case
make
his
position
clear?
justice
marshall
did
he
make
that
clear
to
the
public,
did
he
make
that
clear
to
the
public
or
anybody
else?
justice
marshall
he
made
it
clear
to
whom?
justice
marshall
that
is
not
what
i
am
talking
about.
you
said
that
under
the
law
that
he
has
to
do
this.
but
did
he
do
that,
did
he
make
it
clear
that
he
was
not
interested
in
the
fiduciary
doings
of
that
place,
did
he?
justice
marshall
did
he
say
that
i
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
california
am
not
allowed
to
participate
in
the
fiduciary
business
of
this
corporation?
justice
marshall
when
did
you
or
your
client
find
out
that
he
was
on
the
board?
justice
marshall
you
mean
that
you
tried
that
case
against
the
corporation,
and
you
never
examined
its
minutes;
did
you
ever
examine
the
minutes
of
loyola?
justice
marshall
i
know,
but
it
was
involved.
justice
marshall
but
was
it
property
of
loyola?
justice
marshall
and
you
did
not
look
at
the
minutes?
justice
marshall
wait
a
minute,
do
not
say
that
you
did
not
even
know
that
there
were
minutes.
justice
marshall
but
you
never
looked
at
the
minutes,
you
said.
i
just
think
that
it
is
strange.
if
you
had
looked
at
the
minutes,
you
would
have
known
that
he
was
a
trustee,
would
you
not?
