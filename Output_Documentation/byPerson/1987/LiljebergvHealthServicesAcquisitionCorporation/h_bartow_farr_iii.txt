mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
disagreement
with
the
fifth
circuit
decision
in
this
case
rests
upon
two
basic
grounds.
first,
we
think
that
final
judgments
should
not
be
set
aside
because
of
after
the
fact
recusal
motions,
unless
there
is
a
showing
of
actual
judicial
impropriety.
second,
we
think
that
such
relief
is
particularly
inappropriate
when
at
the
time
of
judgment
that
the
district
judge
did
not
even
know
of
possible
grounds
for
recusal.
because
a
judge
without
knowledge
cannot
possibly
favor
one
side
or
the
other,
it
is
in
fact
is
more
unfair
in
this
case
to
throw
out
the
judgment
than
it
is
to
give
it
effect.
now
i
would
like
to
just
spend
a
few
minutes
at
the
outset
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
findings
made
by
a
separate
district
judge
showed
that
at
the
time
that
he
rendered
his
judgment
and
at
the
relevant
time
that
the
case
was
before
him,
that
judge
collins
had
no
recollection
of
and
no
knowledge
of
any
discussions
between
petitioner
and
loyola
university
regarding
the
possible
purchase
of
some
loyola
land.
the
judge
found
that
there
were
numerous
individuals
who
had
been
discussing
the
possible
purchase
with
loyola,
and
that
judge
collins
did
not
have
any
recollection
that
petitioner
was
among
them.
now
the
court
will
recall
that
this
case
did
not
involve
loyola
university
in
any
way.
loyola
was
not
a
party
to
the
case.
its
land
was
never
mentioned
in
the
case,
and
its
interest
was
never
mentioned
in
the
case.
there
was
some
discussion
of
land
in
the
opinion,
but
that
is
completely
different
land
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
loyola
university.
judge
collins
was
said
to
have
known
at
an
earlier
time,
because
he
was
present
at
some
board
meetings
where
the
matter
was
discussed
and
after
his
judgment,
but
the
specific
finding
is
that
at
the
time
of
his
judgment
that
he
did
not
know.
now
i
should
take
this
opportunity
to
correct
a
statement
that
i
did
make
at
the
first
argument,
which
is
that
he
did
not
have
earlier
knowledge
either.
the
court
did
find
that
he
had
had
earlier
knowledge,
but
said
that
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
before
him
that
he
did
not
have
any
knowledge
of
these
discussions.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
am
sorry.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
both.
i
think
that
the
specific
finding
actually
is
stated
in
terms
of
knowledge.
but
i
think
that
it
is
implicit
in
that
that
he
would
not
have
remembered
any
earlier
information
that
he
might
have
had
by
virtue
of
having
attended
the
board
meetings.
now
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
reverse
its
finding.
in
fact,
it
reaffirmed
that
judge
collins
did
not
know
at
the
time
of
his
judgment
about
the
discussions.
what
it
held
was
simply
that
the
judgment
had
to
be
set
aside,
because
in
effect
he
should
have
known.
now
in
discussing
this
decision,
i
would
like
to
begin
with
what
i
think
is
an
obvious
but
important
point.
that
the
question
here
is
not
simply
one
of
getting
another
judge
at
the
beginning
of
the
case,
which
is
what
section
455
is
basically
aimed
at.
the
question
here
is
one
of
setting
aside
a
final
judgment
based
on
a
motion
that
was
made
after
the
judgment
was
entered.
now
usually,
this
court
has
set
a
high
threshold
for
claims
raised
for
the
first
time
after
judgment.
there
are,
of
course,
plain
error
rules
on
appeal
and
things
like
that.
and
for
rule
60(b)(6),
which
is
the
rule
under
which
this
particular
motion
has
been
made,
usually
the
court
has
required
a
showing
of
exceptional
circumstances
before
it
would
find
a
basis
for
a
judgment
being
set
aside.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
judge
signed
the
judgment
on
the
12th
of
march,
and
the
judgment
was
entered
formally
on
the
16th.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
date
that
the
court
is
using
is
the
24th
of
march,
perhaps
the
25th,
but
i
think
the
24th.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
do
not
think
that
the
judge
in
the
case
after
the
judgment
essentially
had
been
entered
had
any
specific
duty
under
the
statute.
i
think,
frankly,
that
it
would
have
been
better
practice,
since
it
was
so
close
to
the
time
of
judgment,
if
he
had
informed
the
parties,
but
it
would
not
make
any
difference
to
our
position
in
this
case
even
if
he
had.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
we
would
take
exactly
the
same
position,
justice
stevens.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
right.
i
mean
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
essentially
a
situation
where
he
enters
a
judgment
and
he
decides
a
case,
and
he
has
no
reason
to
favor
one
party
or
the
other.
and
although,
as
i
say,
that
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
better
practice
had
he
made
that
clear
eight
days
later,
it
would
not
have
made
any
difference
to
the
decision.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
have.
i
guess
that
it
depends
whether
we
are
talking
a
couple
of
days
meaning
before
he
had
entered
judgment.
i
think
in
that
case,
because
the
case
would
have
still
have
been
before
him,
that
he
would
have
not
entered
a
judgment.
i
think
that
at
that
point
that
he
might
well
have
had
a
duty
to
step
aside
and
let
another
judge
take
over
at
that
point.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
right.
that
would
be
my
understanding
of
the
statute.
the
only
reason
in
fact
that
i
used
the
phrase
"might
well"
is
that
there
is
the
unusual
circumstance
in
this
case
that
he
did
announce
his
ruling
from
the
bench.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
what
happened
in
fact
when
the
rule
60(b)
motion
was
filed
and
it
was
filed
approximately
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
time
that
we
are
talking
about
now,
he
sought
to
reassign
it
to
another
judge
for
decision.
however,
they
sent
it
back
to
him.
at
that
time,
he
was
no
longer
a
trustee
of
loyola
university.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
as
long
as
he
was
a
trustee
of
loyola
university,
that
is
correct.
at
the
time
that
the
motion
was
made,
the
rule
60(b)
motion,
in
fact
he
was
no
longer
a
trustee
of
loyola
university.
so
for
example,
if
the
case
had
been
filed
the
first
time
at
that
point,
then
he
might
well
not
have
had
an
obligation
to
recuse
himself.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
if
there
was
a
finding
that
he
did
not
know
about
his
wife's
interest,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
there
would
be
grounds
for
recusal.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
same
case.
the
specific
statutory
provision
that
we
would
be
dealing
with
in
terms
of
the
wife's
interest
in
section
(b)(4),
which
specifically
requires
that
he
know
of
the
interest
before
he
is
disqualified.
now
the
question
then
would
be
if
he
did
not
in
fact
know,
if
he
sat
in
perfect
good
faith
in
ignorance
of
this
interest
that
his
wife
had,
and
that
was
part
of
the
factual
findings
of
the
case,
would
that
then
have
been
a
disqualifying
interest.
i
think
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no.
i
think
that
the
point
that
we
are
making
here
is
that
the
remedy
of
throwing
out
a
final
judgment
for
something
which
is
merely
negligence
is
too
strong
a
remedy.
that
there
is
no
indication
that
in
a
situation
like
that
that
congress
intended
that
at
any
time
that
a
judge
inadvertently
did
not
know
about
something
that
could
be
grounds
for
recusal
if
he
had
known
about
it,
that
the
judgments
automatically
ought
to
be
thrown
out.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it
accepted
the
finding,
and
then
said
that
it
found
that
there
was
an
appearance
of
impropriety.
our
position
certainly
is
that
we
do
not
see
how
there
is
an
appearance
of
impropriety;
if
a
judge
is
sitting
without
knowledge
of
a
possible
disqualifying
interest.
under
those
circumstances,
what
possible
ground
would
he
have
to
favor
one
side
or
the
other.
in
that
particular
case,
there
is
not
the
kind
of
temptation,
which
in
the
words
that
the
court
has
used,
which
would
lead
him
to
hold
the
balance
other
than
straight
and
true.
it
is
only
if
he
has
knowledge.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
and
we
think
that
congress
in
fact
specifically
framed
subsection
(b)
in
terms
of
knowledge
for
just
that
reason.
because
if
you
say
that
as
long
as
you
can
show
that
a
judge
should
have
known
of
something,
just
to
take
the
negligence
standard.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
am
not
ignoring
appearances.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
here
you
have
a
specific
finding
that
he
did
not
know.
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
the
question
of
how
this
appears.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
he
understood
that
he
was
a
trustee.
what
he
did
not
know
that
there
was
any
interest
in
the
case
before.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
your
honor,
what
i
am
submitting
here
is
that
when
you
are
talking
about
a
situation
where
he
in
fact
did
not
have
knowledge,
you
can
only
create
the
appearance
essentially
by
doubting
the
fact
that
he
did
not
have
knowledge.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
can
i
make
two
points
about
that,
justice
stevens.
first
of
all,
of
course,
the
appearance
standard
is
something
which
is
supposed
to
be
used
on
going
forward
basis.
that
is
the
normal
intent
of
it.
and
the
expectation
is--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--on
a
going
forward
basis,
on
a
prospective
basis.
that
the
facts
will
be
known,
and
that
essentially
will
be
a
guideline
for
a
judge
to
use
in
deciding
whether
to
sit
or
in
fact
to
transfer
the
case
to
another
judge.
and
i
think
that
the
question
here
is
a
somewhat
more
difficult
one,
which
is
in
a
situation
where
he
did
not
know,
would
we
just
apply
the
same
rule.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
would
say
so
in
the
example
that
you
have
given
me,
justice
stevens.
i
have
not
been
able
to
think
of
an
example
in
which
i
think
if
a
judge
honestly
did
not
know
of
any
reason
to
be
partial,
that
that
would
legitimately
create
an
appearance
of
partiality.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
of
course,
in
that
case,
justice
scalia,
i
cannot
imagine
that
there
would
be
a
determination
that
he
did
not
about
it.
to
begin
with,
just
to
give
you
a
technical
answer.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
and
that
finding
is
made
on
the
basis
of
a
record
as
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
that
in
a
situation
where
he
does
not
know
about
the
particular
grounds
to
give
rise
to
recusal
that
the
appearance
can
only
be
achieved
essentially
by
not
accepting
the
finding.
but
the
problem
is
that
while
that
may
be
a
situation
that
happens
in
lots
of
cases
where
people
looking
at
it
say
here
is
a
particular
finding
that
a
judge
has
made
and
i
personally
do
not
accept
it,
if
you
follow
that
course
with
section
455(a)
or
even
455(b),
you
are
going
to
open
up
all
sorts
of
situations
where
the
findings
are
controlling.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
that
occurs
in
lots
of
cases,
whether
it
is
something
that
the
judge
knew,
or
whether
it
is
something
that
the
judge
did,
or
something
that
the
judge
said.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
except,
i
think,
that
455(a)
talks
in
terms
of
reasonable
suspicion.
now
i
suppose
that
the
public
may
be
suspicious,
even
after
a
judge
has
said
that
there
is
no
basis
here
for
believing
that
this
judge
did
anything
wrong.
the
public
looks
at
it
and
says,
gee,
if
we
had
been
the
judge,
we
think
that
something
looks
worse
than
that,
we
are
troubled
about
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
do
not
think
that
it
enters
into
this
picture,
justice
o'connor,
and
let
me
try
to
explain
why.
at
the
first
argument,
i
indicated
why
i
thought
that
that
particular
section
did
not
really
apply
here.
because
section
(b)(4)
says
knows,
not
should
know.
and
there
is
nothing
in
(c)
about
a
conclusive
presumption.
but
i
would
like
to
supplement
that
answer
by
pointing
to
the
particular
language
of
subsection
(c).
because
i
think
that
under
any
reading
of
subsection
(c)
that
the
knowledge
that
we
are
talking
about
here
is
not
the
kind
of
knowledge
that
he
would
be
conclusively
presumed
to
know
under
(c),
even
if
it
does
have
the
conclusive
presumption.
what
judge
collins
is
said
not
to
have
known
in
this
case
is
the
names
of
possible
purchasers
of
land
from
loyola
university.
and
if
you
look
at
what
he
is
required
to
know
under
(c)
or
what
he
is
required
to
inform
himself
about
are
fiduciary
financial
interests.
and
financial
interests
are
defined
in
terms
of
ownership
of
a
legal
or
an
equitable
interest.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
let
me
say
that
(c),
of
course,
in
the
hypothetical
of
his
wife,
that
there
is
a
reasonable
efforts
clause
under
(c),
not
a
specific
knowledge
clause.
the
legislative
history
gives
an
example
which
justice
traynor
gave
of
the
difficulty
of
asking
one's
spouse
about
his
or
her
investments,
and
indicates
that
they
particularly
had
a
lower
threshold
in
that
situation.
but
anyway
to
answer
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
there
might
be
a
possible
reading
under
(c)
which
says
that
the
way
that
we
are
going
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
subsection
(c)
is
to
assume
that
a
judge
knows
at
least
about
what
he
is
required
to
inform
himself
about,
and
perhaps
what
he
is
supposed
to
make
reasonable
efforts
about.
but
even
if
that
were
so,
that
still
would
not
mean
that
he
would
have
to
know
not
just
what
he
owned,
what
his
wife
owned,
what
any
private
trust
that
he
served
as
a
trustee
owned
or
any
university,
but
also
anybody
who
might
buy
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
guess
that
i
think
that
it
is
possible,
justice
o'connor.
i
do
not
believe
that
i
need
to
win
those
cases,
so
i
think
that
the
easy
thing
to
do
would
be
just
to
say
yes.
but
i
am
quite
honestly
not
sure
that
even
in
that
situation
that
the
remedy
of
invalidating
a
final
judgment
of
all
prior
rulings
would
be
proper,
just
because
he
did
not
carry
out
the
duty
under
(c).
(c)
essentially
is
an
ethical
requirement.
it
is
in
the
code
of
judicial
ethics.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
there
was
no
specific
finding
about
that
at
all.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
was
the
finding
of
the
court,
that
this
was
an
important
interest
to
loyola.
but
let
me
explain
again
the
situation.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
what
i
would
like
to
point
out
here
is
that
even
if
the
judge
had
carried
out
that
duty
to
its
fullest
degree,
at
least
that
i
think
is
contemplated
by
(c),
had
learned
everything
that
loyola
owned,
that
still
would
not
have
been
enough
to
put
him
on
notice
necessarily
about
the
case
that
was
in
front
of
him.
i
mean
obviously
if
loyola
university
had
been
a
party
or
its
land
had
been
mentioned
in
the
case,
then
you
could
say,
well,
he
is
supposed
to
know
that
they
owned
the
land,
and
then
he
should
recognize
when
it
was
mentioned.
but
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
series
of
board
meetings.
we
are
really
talking
about
i
guess
three
board
meetings
over
a
period
of
several
years,
in
which
the
name
of
the
petitioner
and
the
corporation
that
he
owns
are
mentioned
on
a
couple
of
occasions.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
except
that
was
one
of
numerous
things
that
they
were
talking
about
doing
with
this
particular
piece
of
land.
i
think
that
to
some
extent
that
you
have
to
put
yourself
in
the
position
that
a
trustee
is
in
in
these
board
meetings,
where
you
are
talking
about
numerous
items
that
come
up,
for
example.
and
any
report
by
the
real
estate
committee,
for
example,
is
one
of
ten,
a
dozen,
or
twenty
things
that
are
discussed
at
a
meeting.
and
even
then,
the
idea
of
using
this
as
a
hospital
was
one
idea.
the
idea
of
using
it
as
a
shopping
center
was
another
idea.
there
is
a
part
in
the
minutes
about
somebody
wanting
to
use
it
for
parking.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
there
were
minutes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
he
said
that
what
he
did
is
that
he
scanned
the
minutes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
he
said
that
he
scans
the
minutes
of
the
meeting,
but
that
he
took
no
particular
interest
in
these
financial
dealings.
and
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is
important
to
note--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
the
public
has
to
understand
the
position
that
a
judge
is
in,
particularly
as
a
fiduciary
of
an
institution
like
a
university.
the
code
of
judicial
ethics
in
fact
prohibits
a
judge
from
taking
an
active
interest
in
the
financial
affairs
of
loyola
university.
he
is
not
allowed
to
do
that
ethically.
he
can
a
trustee
for
certain
kinds
of
private
trusts,
and
he
can
serve
in
a
fiduciary
capability
for
a
public
institution,
but
he
cannot
take
an
active
role
in
the
financing.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
he
did
not
take
an
active
role
in
loyola's
finances.
in
fact,
that
is
precisely
what
he
said.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
he
testified
under
oath
to
that
effect;
yes,
he
did.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
when
a
rule
60
motion
was
filed
a
year
and
a
half
afterwards.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question
quite
honestly.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
that
he
did
that.
but
i
do
know
that
he
did
not
serve
on
the
real
estate
committee,
that
he
did
not
serve
on
the
investment
committee,
that
he
did
not
serve
on
the
executive
committee.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
code
of
ethics
allows
you
to
vote
as
a
general
trustee
on
financial
matters.
what
it
does
not
allow
you
to
do,
however,
is
to
actually
participate
in
making
the
financial
decisions.
and
i
think
that
what
is
happening
is
that
in
a
sense
that
we
are
looking
to
impose.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
do
i
think
that
it
is
appropriate?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
if
he
knows
that
there
is
a
financial
matter
either
at
the
board
meeting
or
in
his
court,
that
he
should
not
vote
on
it
if
it
is
in
his
court,
or
that
he
should
recuse
himself
if
the
matter
is
before
him
in
his
courtroom.
but
those
are
cases,
of
course,
where
we
are
talking
about
knowledge.
and
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
situation
where
judge
collins
could
not
reasonably
have
had
any
reason
to
favor
one
party
or
another.
and
the
question
really
then
is
is
it
appropriate--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--pardon
me.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
not
that
specific
finding.
but
the
finding
that
he
had
no
knowledge,
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
follows
naturally
from
that
that
if
you
do
not
know
about
any
reason
to
be
partial,
that
there
is
no
reason
that
you
would
favor
one
party
over
the
other.
and
the
court
below
accepted
his
testimony
to
the
effect
that
he
did
not
know
at
the
time
that
he
sat
on
the
case.
now
i
would
just
like
to
make
one
brief
point,
and
then
save
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
the
type
of
thing
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
issue
of
allegations
about
a
judge
and
what
is
determined,
and
then
what
the
public
believes,
does
come
up
in
several
different
kinds
of
cases.
and
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
i
wanted
to
say
that
there
are
cases,
for
example,
where
there
is
an
allegation
made
that
a
judge
made
an
out
of
court
statement
to
a
third
party
which
indicates
some
sort
of
bias
or
prejudice.
and
in
each
of
those
cases,
there
is
then
a
question
as
to
whether
in
fact
the
judge
made
the
statement.
and
there
have
been
fact
findings.
there
is
a
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
balastrue;
the
ninth
circuit,
conford;
and
the
fifth
circuit,
brown,
which
are
examples
of
this.
sometimes
the
fact
finding
is
not
favorable
to
the
judge.
that
was
the
situation
in
the
brown
case.
and
sometimes
it
is.
but
it
is
that
finding,
whether
he
said
it
or
what
he
said,
that
is
then
used
as
the
basis
for
application
of
the
statutory
provision.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
guess
that
i
do
at
some
point
part
company
on
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
is
both.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
our
initial
position,
as
i
meant
to
indicate,
was
that
this
is
not
a
permissible
remedy
or
not
an
acceptable
remedy,
simply
for
an
appearance
of
impropriety,
when
you
are
talking
about
a
motion
filed
after
the
fact.
that
is
what
the
seventh
circuit's
rule
is.
what
i
am
saying
in
addition
though
is
that
because
of
the
finding
of
lack
of
knowledge,
i
think
that
if
you
credit
that,
there
is
not
even
an
appearance
of
partiality
in
this
case.
thank
you.
i
will
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
counsel
talked
briefly
about
aetna
life
insurance
v.
lavoie.
and
i
think
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
that
case
points
out
what
i
think
is
a
very
important
part
of
this
case,
which
is
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
judge
who
sits
knowing
of
a
possible
interest
and
a
judge
who
sits
when
he
does
not
know
it.
in
lavoie,
the
court
did
hold
that
one
of
the
justices
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
should
be
disqualified,
because
he
sat
knowing
of
an
interest.
the
court
was
also
asked,
however,
to
disqualify
all
of
the
other
judges
of
the
court
because
they
were
class
members.
and
in
discussing
that
claim,
this
court
pointed
out
that
they
were
not
even
aware
of
any
interest
in
the
case
when
they
sat
on
it
up
until
the
time
of
the
rehearing.
and
the
court
assumed,
and
i
think
correctly,
that
they
could
not
have
had
any
reason
to
be
biased,
at
least
up
to
the
time
that
they
knew
about
it.
i
think
that
what
this
case
really
is
coming
down
to
from
the
gist
of
respondent's
argument
is
the
question
as
to
whether
you
believe
judge
collins
or
not,
and
he
says
that
reasonable
people
in
this
case
will
not
believe
him.
and
if
in
fact
he
did
something
wrong,
certainly
the
judgment
should
be
thrown
out.
but
the
question
is
what
facts
do
you
have
to
follow
through
on
in
order
to
reach
that
conclusion.
you
have
to
assume,
first
of
all,
that
judge
collins
sat
in
a
case
violating
his
judicial
oath,
knowing
that
a
university
that
he
served
as
a
trustee
had
an
interest,
and
yet
sat
to
favor
that
interest.
when
it
was
called
to
his
attention
eighteen
months
later
in
a
motion,
he
falsely
denied
that
he
knew
about
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
was
called
to
his
attention.
but
at
that
time,
as
he
testified,
he
said
that
the
case
was
disposed
of.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
agree
at
that
time
that
it
would
have
been
better
practice.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
do
not
agree,
justice
stevens.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
as
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
addressing
that
issue,
it
would
have
been
better
had
he
done
so.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
at
that
point,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
had
a
duty
to
do
so.
but
let
me
return.
even
if
he
did,
i
think
at
that
point
that
it
just
would
have
been
a
matter
of
recusing
himself
from
any
motions,
and
there
were
none
made
at
that
time.
but
let
me
again
go
back
to
these
facts.
the
motion
was
made
to
judge
collins.
judge
collins
said
i
did
not
know
about
it.
his
deposition
is
taken
under
oath,
and
he
says
i
did
not
know
about
it.
judge
schwartz
makes
a
finding
that
says
that
he
did
not
know
about
it.
and
three
judges
on
the
fifth
circuit
say
we
accept
that
finding,
we
do
not
believe
that
judge
collins
knew
about
it
either.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
as
i
have
indicated
before,
your
honor,
there
is
a
procedure
set
up
for
disciplining
judges,
which
congress
set
up
six
years
after
it
amended
455
that
depends
on
judges
taking
responsibility
for
the
conduct
of
other
judges.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
disagreement
with
the
fifth
circuit
decision
in
this
case
rests
upon
two
basic
grounds.
first,
we
think
that
final
judgments
should
not
be
set
aside
because
of
after
the
fact
recusal
motions,
unless
there
is
a
showing
of
actual
judicial
impropriety.
second,
we
think
that
such
relief
is
particularly
inappropriate
when
at
the
time
of
judgment
that
the
district
judge
did
not
even
know
of
possible
grounds
for
recusal.
because
a
judge
without
knowledge
cannot
possibly
favor
one
side
or
the
other,
it
is
in
fact
is
more
unfair
in
this
case
to
throw
out
the
judgment
than
it
is
to
give
it
effect.
now
i
would
like
to
just
spend
a
few
minutes
at
the
outset
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
findings
made
by
a
separate
district
judge
showed
that
at
the
time
that
he
rendered
his
judgment
and
at
the
relevant
time
that
the
case
was
before
him,
that
judge
collins
had
no
recollection
of
and
no
knowledge
of
any
discussions
between
petitioner
and
loyola
university
regarding
the
possible
purchase
of
some
loyola
land.
the
judge
found
that
there
were
numerous
individuals
who
had
been
discussing
the
possible
purchase
with
loyola,
and
that
judge
collins
did
not
have
any
recollection
that
petitioner
was
among
them.
now
the
court
will
recall
that
this
case
did
not
involve
loyola
university
in
any
way.
loyola
was
not
a
party
to
the
case.
its
land
was
never
mentioned
in
the
case,
and
its
interest
was
never
mentioned
in
the
case.
there
was
some
discussion
of
land
in
the
opinion,
but
that
is
completely
different
land
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
loyola
university.
judge
collins
was
said
to
have
known
at
an
earlier
time,
because
he
was
present
at
some
board
meetings
where
the
matter
was
discussed
and
after
his
judgment,
but
the
specific
finding
is
that
at
the
time
of
his
judgment
that
he
did
not
know.
now
i
should
take
this
opportunity
to
correct
a
statement
that
i
did
make
at
the
first
argument,
which
is
that
he
did
not
have
earlier
knowledge
either.
the
court
did
find
that
he
had
had
earlier
knowledge,
but
said
that
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
before
him
that
he
did
not
have
any
knowledge
of
these
discussions.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
am
sorry.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
both.
i
think
that
the
specific
finding
actually
is
stated
in
terms
of
knowledge.
but
i
think
that
it
is
implicit
in
that
that
he
would
not
have
remembered
any
earlier
information
that
he
might
have
had
by
virtue
of
having
attended
the
board
meetings.
now
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
reverse
its
finding.
in
fact,
it
reaffirmed
that
judge
collins
did
not
know
at
the
time
of
his
judgment
about
the
discussions.
what
it
held
was
simply
that
the
judgment
had
to
be
set
aside,
because
in
effect
he
should
have
known.
now
in
discussing
this
decision,
i
would
like
to
begin
with
what
i
think
is
an
obvious
but
important
point.
that
the
question
here
is
not
simply
one
of
getting
another
judge
at
the
beginning
of
the
case,
which
is
what
section
455
is
basically
aimed
at.
the
question
here
is
one
of
setting
aside
a
final
judgment
based
on
a
motion
that
was
made
after
the
judgment
was
entered.
now
usually,
this
court
has
set
a
high
threshold
for
claims
raised
for
the
first
time
after
judgment.
there
are,
of
course,
plain
error
rules
on
appeal
and
things
like
that.
and
for
rule
60(b)(6),
which
is
the
rule
under
which
this
particular
motion
has
been
made,
usually
the
court
has
required
a
showing
of
exceptional
circumstances
before
it
would
find
a
basis
for
a
judgment
being
set
aside.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
judge
signed
the
judgment
on
the
12th
of
march,
and
the
judgment
was
entered
formally
on
the
16th.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
date
that
the
court
is
using
is
the
24th
of
march,
perhaps
the
25th,
but
i
think
the
24th.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
do
not
think
that
the
judge
in
the
case
after
the
judgment
essentially
had
been
entered
had
any
specific
duty
under
the
statute.
i
think,
frankly,
that
it
would
have
been
better
practice,
since
it
was
so
close
to
the
time
of
judgment,
if
he
had
informed
the
parties,
but
it
would
not
make
any
difference
to
our
position
in
this
case
even
if
he
had.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
we
would
take
exactly
the
same
position,
justice
stevens.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
right.
i
mean
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
essentially
a
situation
where
he
enters
a
judgment
and
he
decides
a
case,
and
he
has
no
reason
to
favor
one
party
or
the
other.
and
although,
as
i
say,
that
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
better
practice
had
he
made
that
clear
eight
days
later,
it
would
not
have
made
any
difference
to
the
decision.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
have.
i
guess
that
it
depends
whether
we
are
talking
a
couple
of
days
meaning
before
he
had
entered
judgment.
i
think
in
that
case,
because
the
case
would
have
still
have
been
before
him,
that
he
would
have
not
entered
a
judgment.
i
think
that
at
that
point
that
he
might
well
have
had
a
duty
to
step
aside
and
let
another
judge
take
over
at
that
point.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
right.
that
would
be
my
understanding
of
the
statute.
the
only
reason
in
fact
that
i
used
the
phrase
"might
well"
is
that
there
is
the
unusual
circumstance
in
this
case
that
he
did
announce
his
ruling
from
the
bench.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
what
happened
in
fact
when
the
rule
60(b)
motion
was
filed
and
it
was
filed
approximately
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
time
that
we
are
talking
about
now,
he
sought
to
reassign
it
to
another
judge
for
decision.
however,
they
sent
it
back
to
him.
at
that
time,
he
was
no
longer
a
trustee
of
loyola
university.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
as
long
as
he
was
a
trustee
of
loyola
university,
that
is
correct.
at
the
time
that
the
motion
was
made,
the
rule
60(b)
motion,
in
fact
he
was
no
longer
a
trustee
of
loyola
university.
so
for
example,
if
the
case
had
been
filed
the
first
time
at
that
point,
then
he
might
well
not
have
had
an
obligation
to
recuse
himself.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
if
there
was
a
finding
that
he
did
not
know
about
his
wife's
interest,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
there
would
be
grounds
for
recusal.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
same
case.
the
specific
statutory
provision
that
we
would
be
dealing
with
in
terms
of
the
wife's
interest
in
section
(b)(4),
which
specifically
requires
that
he
know
of
the
interest
before
he
is
disqualified.
now
the
question
then
would
be
if
he
did
not
in
fact
know,
if
he
sat
in
perfect
good
faith
in
ignorance
of
this
interest
that
his
wife
had,
and
that
was
part
of
the
factual
findings
of
the
case,
would
that
then
have
been
a
disqualifying
interest.
i
think
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no.
i
think
that
the
point
that
we
are
making
here
is
that
the
remedy
of
throwing
out
a
final
judgment
for
something
which
is
merely
negligence
is
too
strong
a
remedy.
that
there
is
no
indication
that
in
a
situation
like
that
that
congress
intended
that
at
any
time
that
a
judge
inadvertently
did
not
know
about
something
that
could
be
grounds
for
recusal
if
he
had
known
about
it,
that
the
judgments
automatically
ought
to
be
thrown
out.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it
accepted
the
finding,
and
then
said
that
it
found
that
there
was
an
appearance
of
impropriety.
our
position
certainly
is
that
we
do
not
see
how
there
is
an
appearance
of
impropriety;
if
a
judge
is
sitting
without
knowledge
of
a
possible
disqualifying
interest.
under
those
circumstances,
what
possible
ground
would
he
have
to
favor
one
side
or
the
other.
in
that
particular
case,
there
is
not
the
kind
of
temptation,
which
in
the
words
that
the
court
has
used,
which
would
lead
him
to
hold
the
balance
other
than
straight
and
true.
it
is
only
if
he
has
knowledge.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
and
we
think
that
congress
in
fact
specifically
framed
subsection
(b)
in
terms
of
knowledge
for
just
that
reason.
because
if
you
say
that
as
long
as
you
can
show
that
a
judge
should
have
known
of
something,
just
to
take
the
negligence
standard.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
am
not
ignoring
appearances.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
here
you
have
a
specific
finding
that
he
did
not
know.
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
the
question
of
how
this
appears.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
he
understood
that
he
was
a
trustee.
what
he
did
not
know
that
there
was
any
interest
in
the
case
before.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
your
honor,
what
i
am
submitting
here
is
that
when
you
are
talking
about
a
situation
where
he
in
fact
did
not
have
knowledge,
you
can
only
create
the
appearance
essentially
by
doubting
the
fact
that
he
did
not
have
knowledge.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
can
i
make
two
points
about
that,
justice
stevens.
first
of
all,
of
course,
the
appearance
standard
is
something
which
is
supposed
to
be
used
on
going
forward
basis.
that
is
the
normal
intent
of
it.
and
the
expectation
is--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--on
a
going
forward
basis,
on
a
prospective
basis.
that
the
facts
will
be
known,
and
that
essentially
will
be
a
guideline
for
a
judge
to
use
in
deciding
whether
to
sit
or
in
fact
to
transfer
the
case
to
another
judge.
and
i
think
that
the
question
here
is
a
somewhat
more
difficult
one,
which
is
in
a
situation
where
he
did
not
know,
would
we
just
apply
the
same
rule.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
would
say
so
in
the
example
that
you
have
given
me,
justice
stevens.
i
have
not
been
able
to
think
of
an
example
in
which
i
think
if
a
judge
honestly
did
not
know
of
any
reason
to
be
partial,
that
that
would
legitimately
create
an
appearance
of
partiality.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
of
course,
in
that
case,
justice
scalia,
i
cannot
imagine
that
there
would
be
a
determination
that
he
did
not
about
it.
to
begin
with,
just
to
give
you
a
technical
answer.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
and
that
finding
is
made
on
the
basis
of
a
record
as
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
that
in
a
situation
where
he
does
not
know
about
the
particular
grounds
to
give
rise
to
recusal
that
the
appearance
can
only
be
achieved
essentially
by
not
accepting
the
finding.
but
the
problem
is
that
while
that
may
be
a
situation
that
happens
in
lots
of
cases
where
people
looking
at
it
say
here
is
a
particular
finding
that
a
judge
has
made
and
i
personally
do
not
accept
it,
if
you
follow
that
course
with
section
455(a)
or
even
455(b),
you
are
going
to
open
up
all
sorts
of
situations
where
the
findings
are
controlling.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
that
occurs
in
lots
of
cases,
whether
it
is
something
that
the
judge
knew,
or
whether
it
is
something
that
the
judge
did,
or
something
that
the
judge
said.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
except,
i
think,
that
455(a)
talks
in
terms
of
reasonable
suspicion.
now
i
suppose
that
the
public
may
be
suspicious,
even
after
a
judge
has
said
that
there
is
no
basis
here
for
believing
that
this
judge
did
anything
wrong.
the
public
looks
at
it
and
says,
gee,
if
we
had
been
the
judge,
we
think
that
something
looks
worse
than
that,
we
are
troubled
about
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
do
not
think
that
it
enters
into
this
picture,
justice
o'connor,
and
let
me
try
to
explain
why.
at
the
first
argument,
i
indicated
why
i
thought
that
that
particular
section
did
not
really
apply
here.
because
section
(b)(4)
says
knows,
not
should
know.
and
there
is
nothing
in
(c)
about
a
conclusive
presumption.
but
i
would
like
to
supplement
that
answer
by
pointing
to
the
particular
language
of
subsection
(c).
because
i
think
that
under
any
reading
of
subsection
(c)
that
the
knowledge
that
we
are
talking
about
here
is
not
the
kind
of
knowledge
that
he
would
be
conclusively
presumed
to
know
under
(c),
even
if
it
does
have
the
conclusive
presumption.
what
judge
collins
is
said
not
to
have
known
in
this
case
is
the
names
of
possible
purchasers
of
land
from
loyola
university.
and
if
you
look
at
what
he
is
required
to
know
under
(c)
or
what
he
is
required
to
inform
himself
about
are
fiduciary
financial
interests.
and
financial
interests
are
defined
in
terms
of
ownership
of
a
legal
or
an
equitable
interest.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
let
me
say
that
(c),
of
course,
in
the
hypothetical
of
his
wife,
that
there
is
a
reasonable
efforts
clause
under
(c),
not
a
specific
knowledge
clause.
the
legislative
history
gives
an
example
which
justice
traynor
gave
of
the
difficulty
of
asking
one's
spouse
about
his
or
her
investments,
and
indicates
that
they
particularly
had
a
lower
threshold
in
that
situation.
but
anyway
to
answer
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
there
might
be
a
possible
reading
under
(c)
which
says
that
the
way
that
we
are
going
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
subsection
(c)
is
to
assume
that
a
judge
knows
at
least
about
what
he
is
required
to
inform
himself
about,
and
perhaps
what
he
is
supposed
to
make
reasonable
efforts
about.
but
even
if
that
were
so,
that
still
would
not
mean
that
he
would
have
to
know
not
just
what
he
owned,
what
his
wife
owned,
what
any
private
trust
that
he
served
as
a
trustee
owned
or
any
university,
but
also
anybody
who
might
buy
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
guess
that
i
think
that
it
is
possible,
justice
o'connor.
i
do
not
believe
that
i
need
to
win
those
cases,
so
i
think
that
the
easy
thing
to
do
would
be
just
to
say
yes.
but
i
am
quite
honestly
not
sure
that
even
in
that
situation
that
the
remedy
of
invalidating
a
final
judgment
of
all
prior
rulings
would
be
proper,
just
because
he
did
not
carry
out
the
duty
under
(c).
(c)
essentially
is
an
ethical
requirement.
it
is
in
the
code
of
judicial
ethics.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
there
was
no
specific
finding
about
that
at
all.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
was
the
finding
of
the
court,
that
this
was
an
important
interest
to
loyola.
but
let
me
explain
again
the
situation.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
what
i
would
like
to
point
out
here
is
that
even
if
the
judge
had
carried
out
that
duty
to
its
fullest
degree,
at
least
that
i
think
is
contemplated
by
(c),
had
learned
everything
that
loyola
owned,
that
still
would
not
have
been
enough
to
put
him
on
notice
necessarily
about
the
case
that
was
in
front
of
him.
i
mean
obviously
if
loyola
university
had
been
a
party
or
its
land
had
been
mentioned
in
the
case,
then
you
could
say,
well,
he
is
supposed
to
know
that
they
owned
the
land,
and
then
he
should
recognize
when
it
was
mentioned.
but
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
series
of
board
meetings.
we
are
really
talking
about
i
guess
three
board
meetings
over
a
period
of
several
years,
in
which
the
name
of
the
petitioner
and
the
corporation
that
he
owns
are
mentioned
on
a
couple
of
occasions.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
except
that
was
one
of
numerous
things
that
they
were
talking
about
doing
with
this
particular
piece
of
land.
i
think
that
to
some
extent
that
you
have
to
put
yourself
in
the
position
that
a
trustee
is
in
in
these
board
meetings,
where
you
are
talking
about
numerous
items
that
come
up,
for
example.
and
any
report
by
the
real
estate
committee,
for
example,
is
one
of
ten,
a
dozen,
or
twenty
things
that
are
discussed
at
a
meeting.
and
even
then,
the
idea
of
using
this
as
a
hospital
was
one
idea.
the
idea
of
using
it
as
a
shopping
center
was
another
idea.
there
is
a
part
in
the
minutes
about
somebody
wanting
to
use
it
for
parking.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
there
were
minutes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
he
said
that
what
he
did
is
that
he
scanned
the
minutes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
he
said
that
he
scans
the
minutes
of
the
meeting,
but
that
he
took
no
particular
interest
in
these
financial
dealings.
and
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is
important
to
note--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
the
public
has
to
understand
the
position
that
a
judge
is
in,
particularly
as
a
fiduciary
of
an
institution
like
a
university.
the
code
of
judicial
ethics
in
fact
prohibits
a
judge
from
taking
an
active
interest
in
the
financial
affairs
of
loyola
university.
he
is
not
allowed
to
do
that
ethically.
he
can
a
trustee
for
certain
kinds
of
private
trusts,
and
he
can
serve
in
a
fiduciary
capability
for
a
public
institution,
but
he
cannot
take
an
active
role
in
the
financing.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
he
did
not
take
an
active
role
in
loyola's
finances.
in
fact,
that
is
precisely
what
he
said.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
he
testified
under
oath
to
that
effect;
yes,
he
did.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
when
a
rule
60
motion
was
filed
a
year
and
a
half
afterwards.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question
quite
honestly.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
that
he
did
that.
but
i
do
know
that
he
did
not
serve
on
the
real
estate
committee,
that
he
did
not
serve
on
the
investment
committee,
that
he
did
not
serve
on
the
executive
committee.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
code
of
ethics
allows
you
to
vote
as
a
general
trustee
on
financial
matters.
what
it
does
not
allow
you
to
do,
however,
is
to
actually
participate
in
making
the
financial
decisions.
and
i
think
that
what
is
happening
is
that
in
a
sense
that
we
are
looking
to
impose.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
do
i
think
that
it
is
appropriate?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
if
he
knows
that
there
is
a
financial
matter
either
at
the
board
meeting
or
in
his
court,
that
he
should
not
vote
on
it
if
it
is
in
his
court,
or
that
he
should
recuse
himself
if
the
matter
is
before
him
in
his
courtroom.
but
those
are
cases,
of
course,
where
we
are
talking
about
knowledge.
and
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
situation
where
judge
collins
could
not
reasonably
have
had
any
reason
to
favor
one
party
or
another.
and
the
question
really
then
is
is
it
appropriate--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--pardon
me.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
not
that
specific
finding.
but
the
finding
that
he
had
no
knowledge,
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
follows
naturally
from
that
that
if
you
do
not
know
about
any
reason
to
be
partial,
that
there
is
no
reason
that
you
would
favor
one
party
over
the
other.
and
the
court
below
accepted
his
testimony
to
the
effect
that
he
did
not
know
at
the
time
that
he
sat
on
the
case.
now
i
would
just
like
to
make
one
brief
point,
and
then
save
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
the
type
of
thing
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
issue
of
allegations
about
a
judge
and
what
is
determined,
and
then
what
the
public
believes,
does
come
up
in
several
different
kinds
of
cases.
and
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
i
wanted
to
say
that
there
are
cases,
for
example,
where
there
is
an
allegation
made
that
a
judge
made
an
out
of
court
statement
to
a
third
party
which
indicates
some
sort
of
bias
or
prejudice.
and
in
each
of
those
cases,
there
is
then
a
question
as
to
whether
in
fact
the
judge
made
the
statement.
and
there
have
been
fact
findings.
there
is
a
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
balastrue;
the
ninth
circuit,
conford;
and
the
fifth
circuit,
brown,
which
are
examples
of
this.
sometimes
the
fact
finding
is
not
favorable
to
the
judge.
that
was
the
situation
in
the
brown
case.
and
sometimes
it
is.
but
it
is
that
finding,
whether
he
said
it
or
what
he
said,
that
is
then
used
as
the
basis
for
application
of
the
statutory
provision.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
guess
that
i
do
at
some
point
part
company
on
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
is
both.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
our
initial
position,
as
i
meant
to
indicate,
was
that
this
is
not
a
permissible
remedy
or
not
an
acceptable
remedy,
simply
for
an
appearance
of
impropriety,
when
you
are
talking
about
a
motion
filed
after
the
fact.
that
is
what
the
seventh
circuit's
rule
is.
what
i
am
saying
in
addition
though
is
that
because
of
the
finding
of
lack
of
knowledge,
i
think
that
if
you
credit
that,
there
is
not
even
an
appearance
of
partiality
in
this
case.
thank
you.
i
will
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
counsel
talked
briefly
about
aetna
life
insurance
v.
lavoie.
and
i
think
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
that
case
points
out
what
i
think
is
a
very
important
part
of
this
case,
which
is
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
judge
who
sits
knowing
of
a
possible
interest
and
a
judge
who
sits
when
he
does
not
know
it.
in
lavoie,
the
court
did
hold
that
one
of
the
justices
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
should
be
disqualified,
because
he
sat
knowing
of
an
interest.
the
court
was
also
asked,
however,
to
disqualify
all
of
the
other
judges
of
the
court
because
they
were
class
members.
and
in
discussing
that
claim,
this
court
pointed
out
that
they
were
not
even
aware
of
any
interest
in
the
case
when
they
sat
on
it
up
until
the
time
of
the
rehearing.
and
the
court
assumed,
and
i
think
correctly,
that
they
could
not
have
had
any
reason
to
be
biased,
at
least
up
to
the
time
that
they
knew
about
it.
i
think
that
what
this
case
really
is
coming
down
to
from
the
gist
of
respondent's
argument
is
the
question
as
to
whether
you
believe
judge
collins
or
not,
and
he
says
that
reasonable
people
in
this
case
will
not
believe
him.
and
if
in
fact
he
did
something
wrong,
certainly
the
judgment
should
be
thrown
out.
but
the
question
is
what
facts
do
you
have
to
follow
through
on
in
order
to
reach
that
conclusion.
you
have
to
assume,
first
of
all,
that
judge
collins
sat
in
a
case
violating
his
judicial
oath,
knowing
that
a
university
that
he
served
as
a
trustee
had
an
interest,
and
yet
sat
to
favor
that
interest.
when
it
was
called
to
his
attention
eighteen
months
later
in
a
motion,
he
falsely
denied
that
he
knew
about
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
was
called
to
his
attention.
but
at
that
time,
as
he
testified,
he
said
that
the
case
was
disposed
of.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
agree
at
that
time
that
it
would
have
been
better
practice.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
do
not
agree,
justice
stevens.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
as
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
addressing
that
issue,
it
would
have
been
better
had
he
done
so.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
at
that
point,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
had
a
duty
to
do
so.
but
let
me
return.
even
if
he
did,
i
think
at
that
point
that
it
just
would
have
been
a
matter
of
recusing
himself
from
any
motions,
and
there
were
none
made
at
that
time.
but
let
me
again
go
back
to
these
facts.
the
motion
was
made
to
judge
collins.
judge
collins
said
i
did
not
know
about
it.
his
deposition
is
taken
under
oath,
and
he
says
i
did
not
know
about
it.
judge
schwartz
makes
a
finding
that
says
that
he
did
not
know
about
it.
and
three
judges
on
the
fifth
circuit
say
we
accept
that
finding,
we
do
not
believe
that
judge
collins
knew
about
it
either.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
as
i
have
indicated
before,
your
honor,
there
is
a
procedure
set
up
for
disciplining
judges,
which
congress
set
up
six
years
after
it
amended
455
that
depends
on
judges
taking
responsibility
for
the
conduct
of
other
judges.
