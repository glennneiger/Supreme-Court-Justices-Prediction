unknown
speaker
was
the
finding
that
he
did
not
know
or
that
he
did
not
remember?
unknown
speaker
was
the
finding
that
he
did
not
know
or
that
he
did
not
remember?
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
can
i
interrupt
you.
if
you
draw
the
line
at
when
the
judgment
was
entered.
can
you
refresh
my
recollection,
what
was
the
date
on
which
this
judgment
was
entered?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
date
when
he
found
out
about
the
possible
appearance
of
impropriety
arising?
unknown
speaker
and
my
question
is
what
in
your
view
was
the
trial
judge's
duty
under
the
statute
at
that
point
in
time?
unknown
speaker
and
what
would
you
say
if
a
motion
had
been
made
on
say
the
26th
or
27th
of
march,
whatever
the
dates
were?
unknown
speaker
that
it
was
too
late?
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
had
happened
to
open
his
mail
three
of
four
days
earlier.
i
guess
that
there
were
just
a
couple
of
days
before
he
got
those
letters.
and
that
would
have
been
a
critical
difference
too,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
"might
well",
he
would
have
knowledge,
would
he
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
he
had
no
authority
on
the
60(b)
motion,
did
he,
or
the
new
trial
motion?
unknown
speaker
but
as
of
march
24th,
he
was
mandatorily
disqualified
from
this
case
under
any
view,
was
he
not?
unknown
speaker
and
he
had
no
authority
to
make
any
further
rulings
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
he
did
not
remember
the
fact
that
his
wife
owned
this
property.
let
us
just
assume
that
his
wife
owned
the
adjoining
property.
and
as
a
result
of
his
judgment,
his
wife
is
greatly
enriched.
is
that
grounds
for
recusal,
mandatory
recusal?
unknown
speaker
the
same
case?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
you
add
the
fact
that
he
was
negligent
in
not
knowing,
is
there
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
court
below
have
discretion
to
set
aside
the
judgment;
did
the
fifth
circuit
say
that
this
was
automatic,
that
it
had
no
choice?
unknown
speaker
again
the
same
argument
if
he
is
negligent?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
ignoring
appearances,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
everybody
but
him.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
appearances
are
there.
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
is
that
not
the
very
point
of
the
appearance
of
impropriety,
that
the
public
really
does
not
know
exactly
what
the
judge's
state
of
mind
was,
or
whether
he
remembered,
or
deliberately
forgot
or
what.
and
the
appearance
concept
is
designed
to
take
care
of
in
part
of
public
perceptions
of
act
when
you
do
not
in
fact
until
months
later
have
a
finding
of
fact
that
he
did
not
actually
know.
unknown
speaker
on
a
what
kind
of
standard?
i
did
not
understand.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
455(a),
which
i
think
is
the
relevant
provision
here,
can
never
be
violated
if
the
judge
is
not
aware
of
a
disqualifying
fact.
judges
do
this.
they
have
portfolios
of
stock,
and
they
forget
that
they
own
a
hundred
shares
of
some
stock,
but
the
newspapers
check
this
up.
would
you
say
that
there
was
no
violation
of
that
section,
if
the
judge
has
honestly
forgot
about
it,
if
there
was
no
appearance
of
impropriety?
unknown
speaker
wait
a
minute.
let
us
suppose
in
this
case
that
he
is
a
big
booster
for
loyola
and
has
been,
and
everybody
in
town
knows
that
he
is
a
trustee
of
loyola.
and
this
is
a
big
case
and
the
caption
is
loyola
versus
somebody
else.
and
he
for
some
very
strange
reason
forgets
that
he
is
a
trustee,
and
he
continues
to
sit
in
that
case.
do
you
not
think
that
that
would
create
an
appearance
of
impropriety.
the
only
reason
that
i
thought
that
you
could
argue
that
there
was
not
one
here
is
that
the
impropriety
did
not
at
all
consist
about
the
fact,
that
is
was
very
hidden,
even
the
other
side
did
not
realize
that
this
land
or
that
this
company
had
a
bid
in
on
land,
and
if
the
company
went
under
that
the
land
would
not
be
bought
by
that
company,
and
that
the
land
belonged
to
loyola.
i
can
understand
that
that
is
no
appearance
of
impropriety,
because
the
public
at
large
would
not
know
that.
but
the
other
example
that
i
just
gave
you,
would
that
not
be
an
appearance
of
impropriety?
unknown
speaker
it
is
my
hypothetical.
i
mean
there
is
a
determination
that
he
did
not
know
about
it.
unknown
speaker
then
there
is
no
appearance
of
impropriety?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
under
your
view,
as
i
understand
you,
you
really
will
not
know
whether
there
was
an
appearance
of
impropriety
until
you
have
had
a
finding
of
fact
on
the
judge's
state
of
knowledge.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
not
disagreeing
with
you
that
that
is
not
true,
but
that
is
a
little
different
from
one's
normal
concept
of
what
an
appearance
of
impropriety
is.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
appearance
either
exists
or
it
does
not
exist,
and
sometimes
there
is
a
wholly
innocent
explanation
for
it.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
does
not
really
affect
the
public
perception.
the
public
sometimes
is
suspicious
of
us,
even
though
they
really
should
not
be.
unknown
speaker
mr.
farr,
how
does
subsection
(c)
enter
into
this.
it
says
that
the
judge
should
inform
himself
about
his
personal
and
fiduciary
financial
interests,
and
make
a
reasonable
effort,
and
so
forth.
does
that
enter
into
the
picture
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
about
the
hypothetical
that
you
were
asked
about
the
spouse
owning
shares
of
stock,
i
mean
he
deals
with
a
case
involving
that
company,
do
you
not
think
that
(c)
suggests
that
he
should
know
that
his
wife
owns
the
stock?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
case
of
other
than
this
one
then,
do
you
concede
that
(c)
affects
(a)
in
the
sense
at
least
to
the
extent
that
the
judge
is
supposed
to
inform
himself
about
his
own
personal
interests?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
finding
that
he
did
comport
with
his
duties
under
(c)
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
there
could
not
very
well
have
been.
he
is
a
fiduciary,
and
he
has
an
obligation
to
make
sure
of
what
his
beneficiaries'
interests
are.
and
this
was
not
a
small
potatoes
deal,
as
i
understood
it.
did
not
loyola
stand
to
have
its
adjacent
land
increase
tremendously
in
value
if
this
hospital
went
through?
unknown
speaker
and
does
not
the
judge
have
the
duty
to
inquire
as
a
fiduciary
into
all
of
the
interests
of
loyola,
just
to
make
sure
that
this
does
not
happen?
unknown
speaker
but
not
only
that,
but
the
hospital
project.
you
would
think
that
that
would
stick
in
his
mind.
unknown
speaker
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
mention.
there
were
minutes
of
all
of
these
meetings.
unknown
speaker
which
he
was
supposed
to
have
read.
unknown
speaker
anybody
in
the
public
assumes
that
a
trustee
reads
the
minutes.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
convince
the
public
of
that,
that
a
judge
does
not
understand
what
he
is
reading?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
he
in
this
case
make
his
position
clear?
unknown
speaker
did
he
make
that
clear
to
the
public,
did
he
make
that
clear
to
the
public
or
anybody
else?
unknown
speaker
he
made
it
clear
to
whom?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
what
i
am
talking
about.
you
said
that
under
the
law
that
he
has
to
do
this.
but
did
he
do
that,
did
he
make
it
clear
that
he
was
not
interested
in
the
fiduciary
doings
of
that
place,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
did
he
say
that
i
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
california
am
not
allowed
to
participate
in
the
fiduciary
business
of
this
corporation?
unknown
speaker
did
he
disqualify
himself
from
every
vote
on
every
financial
transaction
that
came
before
the
board
of
trustees?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
it
is
appropriate
for
a
judge
to
vote
on
a
financial
matter
which
is
also
appearing
before
his
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
it
is
appropriate
for
a
judge
to
vote
on
a
financial
matter
and
financial
transaction
that
is
being
reviewed
in
his
court?
unknown
speaker
was
that
finding
made
by
the
lower
court?
unknown
speaker
was
that
finding
made
by
the
lower
court?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
mr.
farr,
the
facts
that
give
rise
to
the
violation
of
455(a),
if
there
was
a
violation
of
455(a),
would
exist
before
the
finding
occurred.
whereas
the
ones
that
you
described
depend
on
whether
the
statement
was
made,
which
is
an
objective
fact
yes
or
no.
what
you
in
effect
are
saying
is
that
later
on
you
want
to
know
the
subjective
state
of
mind
of
the
judge
here
to
determine
whether
there
is
an
appearance.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
appearance
might
well
have
existed,
even
though
he
did
not
realize
that
there
was
a
disqualifying
fact.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
455(a)
was
not
violated,
or
that
the
vacation
of
a
judgment
is
an
impermissible
remedy
for
a
violation
of
455(a)?
unknown
speaker
it
is
both.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
that
would
show
that
he
should
disqualify
himself
in
any
proceeding
in
which
his
impartiality
might
reasonably
have
been
questioned.
and
this
says
might
reasonably
be
questioned.
the
proceeding
was
over.
at
the
time
that
it
was
conducted,
there
was
no
reason
for
the
public
to
question
his
impartiality.
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
public
will
not
believe
that
his
colleagues'
finding
that
he
did
not
know
about
it
was
true
later.
unknown
speaker
the
public
did
not
know.
but
the
public
did
not
know.
at
the
time
of
the
proceeding,
even
the
parties
did
not
know,
who
were
much
more
familiar
with
all
of
the
land
involved
in
the
case
and
all
of
that.
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
the
public
would
have
known.
unknown
speaker
the
public
is
deemed
to
know
every
little
detail,
even
though
he
is
unaware
of
those
details,
and
even
though
he
has
no
obligation
to
inform
himself
of
those
details?
unknown
speaker
the
public
did
not
know
the
connection
between
this
company
and
that
land
any
more
than
the
judge
here
did.
do
you
seriously
contend
that
at
the
time
that
the
judgment
was
rendered
that
there
was
an
appearance
of
impropriety?
unknown
speaker
there
was.
to
whom
was
this
appearance
manifest,
since
your
client
did
not
find
out
about
it
until
how
much
later?
maybe
you
are
guilty
of
laches
then.
unknown
speaker
because
then
he
would
come
under
another
provision
where
he
has
personal
bias
or
prejudice,
or
where
he
actually
knows
of
a
financial
interest.
but
here,
you
are
just
saying
that
he
did
not
know
of
it.
i
mean
that
is
quite
different.
here
you
are
saying
that
this
judgment
was
bad,
because
it
appeared
that
he
was
biased.
and
i
find
it
hard
to
say
that
at
the
time
of
the
judgment
that
there
was
any
appearance
of
impropriety.
unknown
speaker
you
tried
this
and
lost,
did
you
not?
unknown
speaker
did
you
not
argue
this
to
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
and
lost
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
want
to
try
that
again
here.
do
we
not
have
to
accept
the
fact
that
he
did
not
know,
is
that
not
the
posture
in
which
this
case
is
going
forward?
unknown
speaker
when
did
you
or
your
client
find
out
that
he
was
on
the
board?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
you
tried
that
case
against
the
corporation,
and
you
never
examined
its
minutes;
did
you
ever
examine
the
minutes
of
loyola?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
was
involved.
unknown
speaker
but
was
it
property
of
loyola?
unknown
speaker
and
you
did
not
look
at
the
minutes?
unknown
speaker
wait
a
minute,
do
not
say
that
you
did
not
even
know
that
there
were
minutes.
unknown
speaker
but
you
never
looked
at
the
minutes,
you
said.
i
just
think
that
it
is
strange.
if
you
had
looked
at
the
minutes,
you
would
have
known
that
he
was
a
trustee,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
you
no
more
than
the
general
public
had
any
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
any
impropriety.
i
mean
that
seems
to
me
very
telling.
and
yet
you
assert
that
there
was
an
appearance
of
impropriety,
although
you
did
not
see
any.
unknown
speaker
that
might
be
actual
bias
or
actual
impropriety,
but
it
would
not
be
an
appearance
of
impropriety,
which
is
what
i
thought
that
we
were
talking
about.
the
discovery
did
not
disclose
that
st.
jude
was
negotiating
with
loyola
as
a
prospective
seller
of
the
land?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
just
assumed
that
a
hospital
would
be
built
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
when
the
judge
failed
to
disclose
his
interest
on
march
24th,
how
did
that
prejudice
you.
i
take
it
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
appellant
argues
that
it
really
did
not
make
any
difference
at
that
point,
that
the
trial
was
over
anyway.
unknown
speaker
what
conclusion
do
we
draw
from
that,
(a)
that
it
would
have
been
easier
to
make
your
motion,
but
does
it
tell
anything
about
what
the
substantive
ruling
on
the
motion
would
have
been.
we
are
back
in
the
same
box
that
we
are
in
now,
that
is
to
say
that
the
trial
is
over.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
the
merits
about
the
recusal
motion
or
the
new
trial
motion.
those
are
the
same,
are
they
not,
on
march
24th
or
ten
months
later,
or
are
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lucas,
such
a
holding
would
not
stretch
as
far
as
you
are
suggesting.
i
mean
if
the
thing
that
he
claims
not
to
have
remembered
is
something
obvious
to
all
of
the
public
and
he
is
the
only
one
in
the
world
who
did
not
remember,
then
you
could
say
whether
he
remembered
it
or
not,
that
there
was
an
appearance
of
impropriety,
because
the
whole
public
knew
that
this
land
was
involved
in
litigation
and
that
he
was
a
trustee
of
loyola.
but
it
is
a
much
narrower
situation
when
you
say
that
it
is
a
little
thing
that
the
public
would
not
know
about,
and
that
it
is
that
he
claims
not
to
remember.
what
is
so
bad
about
letting
that
be
adjudged
by
a
separate
court.
and
if
the
court
is
persuaded
that
he
did
not
remember
it,
there
has
neither
been
an
appearance
of
impropriety
nor
any
actual
impropriety.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
mistaking
what
i
mean
by
a
little
or
big
thing.
i
mean
a
thing
that
is
evident
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
this
was
not
evident
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
your
client
did
not
pick
it
up.
it
was
a
very
remote
connection.
now
maybe
he
should
have
remembered
it,
but
he
did
not,
or
at
least
it
was
found
that
he
did
not.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
is
the
essence
of
what
we
are
debating
about
here.
whether
you
use
what
the
public
reasonably
knew
at
the
time,
or
what
ever
detail
of
the
fact
was
at
the
time.
i
think
that
you
are
right
that
if
you
say
that
that
is
the
basis
on
which
you
do
it,
then
there
was
an
appearance
of
impropriety.
unknown
speaker
were
there
findings
on
when
both
parties
knew,
when
liljeberg
knew?
unknown
speaker
were
there
any
findings
as
to
when
liljeberg
knew
of
the
judge's
trustee
position?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
along
that
line,
mr.
lucas,
something
that
has
always
puzzled
me.
in
the
minutes
of
the
january
22nd
meeting.
what
was
the
date
of
the
trial,
it
was
right
at
about
the
time?
unknown
speaker
the
minutes
of
the
real
estate
committee
on
january
22
refer
to
the
negotiations
with
st.
jude
hospital
corporation,
and
that
mr.
eckholdt
report
that
the
federal
courts
have
determined
that
the
certificate
of
need
will
be
awarded
to
the
st.
jude
corporation.
that
quite
obviously
refers
to
the
judge's
oral
rule
from
the
bench
in
this
case.
but
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
tells
us
how
the
loyola
trustees
came
to
be
aware
of
that
fact?
unknown
speaker
or
whether
they
perhaps
warned
the
judge
that
he
should
not
be
sitting
in
a
case
like
this
or
anything
like
that?
unknown
speaker
that
did
not
come
out
in
discovery?
unknown
speaker
the
loyola
people
were
keeping
track
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
if
you
apply
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
in
a
criminal
case
to
determine
whether
the
judge
in
fact
knew
of
the
biasing
factor,
do
you
not
think
that
you
would
have
to
apply
a
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard?
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
more
than
a
fifty
percent
chance
that
the
judge
was
not
biased,
we
are
going
to
let
the
person
go
to
jail.
i
doubt
that.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
was
called
to
his
attention
very
much
more
promptly
than
eighteen
months.
unknown
speaker
do
you
not
agree
at
that
point
that
he
had
a
duty
to
do
something
more
than
he
did?
unknown
speaker
do
you
not
think
that
he
had
a
duty
to
do
something
more
than
he
did?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
that
he
had
a
duty
to
disclose
to
the
parties
what
the
true
facts
were?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
everybody
knows
that
it
would
have
been
better.
if
it
just
would
have
been
better,
then
you
are
saying
that
he
had
no
duty
to
disclose
at
that
point?
unknown
speaker
and
in
each
of
those
instances,
you
can
substitute
the
word
"remember"
for
the
word
"know"?
unknown
speaker
it
is
rather
for
one
federal
judge
to
call
another
one
a
liar,
is
it
not?
