finding

justice
kennedy
was
the
finding
that
he
did
not
know
or
that
he
did
not
remember?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
he
had
no
authority
on
the
60(b)
motion,
did
he,
or
the
new
trial
motion?
justice
kennedy
but
as
of
march
24th,
he
was
mandatorily
disqualified
from
this
case
under
any
view,
was
he
not?
justice
kennedy
and
he
had
no
authority
to
make
any
further
rulings
in
the
case.
justice
kennedy
suppose
that
he
did
not
remember
the
fact
that
his
wife
owned
this
property.
let
us
just
assume
that
his
wife
owned
the
adjoining
property.
and
as
a
result
of
his
judgment,
his
wife
is
greatly
enriched.
is
that
grounds
for
recusal,
mandatory
recusal?
justice
kennedy
the
same
case?
justice
kennedy
suppose
that
you
add
the
fact
that
he
was
negligent
in
not
knowing,
is
there
any
difference?
justice
kennedy
well,
does
the
court
below
have
discretion
to
set
aside
the
judgment;
did
the
fifth
circuit
say
that
this
was
automatic,
that
it
had
no
choice?
justice
kennedy
again
the
same
argument
if
he
is
negligent?
justice
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
there
could
not
very
well
have
been.
he
is
a
fiduciary,
and
he
has
an
obligation
to
make
sure
of
what
his
beneficiaries'
interests
are.
and
this
was
not
a
small
potatoes
deal,
as
i
understood
it.
did
not
loyola
stand
to
have
its
adjacent
land
increase
tremendously
in
value
if
this
hospital
went
through?
justice
kennedy
and
does
not
the
judge
have
the
duty
to
inquire
as
a
fiduciary
into
all
of
the
interests
of
loyola,
just
to
make
sure
that
this
does
not
happen?
justice
kennedy
but
not
only
that,
but
the
hospital
project.
you
would
think
that
that
would
stick
in
his
mind.
justice
kennedy
did
he
disqualify
himself
from
every
vote
on
every
financial
transaction
that
came
before
the
board
of
trustees?
justice
kennedy
do
you
think
that
it
is
appropriate
for
a
judge
to
vote
on
a
financial
matter
which
is
also
appearing
before
his
court?
justice
kennedy
do
you
think
that
it
is
appropriate
for
a
judge
to
vote
on
a
financial
matter
and
financial
transaction
that
is
being
reviewed
in
his
court?
justice
kennedy
was
that
finding
made
by
the
lower
court?
justice
kennedy
was
that
finding
made
by
the
lower
court?
justice
kennedy
you
just
assumed
that
a
hospital
would
be
built
somewhere?
justice
kennedy
when
the
judge
failed
to
disclose
his
interest
on
march
24th,
how
did
that
prejudice
you.
i
take
it
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
appellant
argues
that
it
really
did
not
make
any
difference
at
that
point,
that
the
trial
was
over
anyway.
justice
kennedy
what
conclusion
do
we
draw
from
that,
(a)
that
it
would
have
been
easier
to
make
your
motion,
but
does
it
tell
anything
about
what
the
substantive
ruling
on
the
motion
would
have
been.
we
are
back
in
the
same
box
that
we
are
in
now,
that
is
to
say
that
the
trial
is
over.
justice
kennedy
what
about
the
merits?
justice
kennedy
the
merits
about
the
recusal
motion
or
the
new
trial
motion.
those
are
the
same,
are
they
not,
on
march
24th
or
ten
months
later,
or
are
they?
justice
kennedy
were
there
findings
on
when
both
parties
knew,
when
liljeberg
knew?
justice
kennedy
were
there
any
findings
as
to
when
liljeberg
knew
of
the
judge's
trustee
position?
justice
kennedy
and
in
each
of
those
instances,
you
can
substitute
the
word
"remember"
for
the
word
"know"?
