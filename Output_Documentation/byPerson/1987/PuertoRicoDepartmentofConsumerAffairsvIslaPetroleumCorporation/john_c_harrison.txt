mr.
john
c.
harrison
thank
you,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
in
the
emergency
petroleum
allocation
act
of
1973
as
amended
that
congress
exercised
its
power
to
displace
the
normal
system
of
dual
government,
and
the
authorities
of
the
states
and
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
in
a
field
traditionally
subject
to
their
authority.
that
conclusion
was
made
despite
the
presumption
that
normally
congress
does
not
exercise
that
authority
that
it
unquestionably
has,
and
it
finds
no
support
in
the
structure
of
history
of
the
emergency
petroleum
allocation
act
or
in
this
court's
cases.
the
act,
the
epaa,
has
a
preemption
clause
that
clearly
does
not
apply
to
puerto
rico's
regulation
that
is
at
issue
here.
moreover,
there
is
no
substantive
provision
of
the
epaa
that
would
said
to
imply
preemption
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
used
that
concept
whenever
it
has
found
implied
preemption,
that
is
that
there
is
no
regulatory
scheme
of
the
federal
government
that
can
be
said
to
displace
either
completely
or
in
certain
circumstances
regulations
by
the
states
of
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico.
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
found
such
displacement
have
involved
fairly
careful
inquiries
into
the
nature
and
content
of
the
federal
regulation,
and
there
is
nothing
like
that
left
in
the
epaa.
it
now
provides
no
substantive
rule
at
all.
moreover,
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
final
revision
of
the
epaa
in
1975,
the
epca,
negate
any
inference
of
preemption.
there
was
no
mention
of
ongoing
preemption
by
the
epaa.
indeed,
the
context
makes
it
quite
clear
that
what
congress
thought
that
it
was
doing
with
the
epaa
was
phasing
it
out,
instead
of
just
letting
it
expire
immediately.
and
if
it
had
expired
immediately,
there
was
no
suggestion
that
there
would
have
been
preemption,
and
the
expiration
would
have
needed
to
take
more
time
than
that
to
run
ultimately
through
1981.
but
no
one
suggested
that
after
1981
when
the
statute's
effects
came
to
an
end
and
when
the
president's
power
was
no
longer
available
under
the
statute
that
there
might
have
been
preemption.
this
is
particularly
striking
given
that,
as
mr.
coleman
noted,
every
other
part
of
the
epca,
the
1975
legislation,
deals
with
preemption
explicitly.
in
title
v
of
the
epca,
there
is
a
presumption
clause
dealing
with
titles
i
and
ii.
title
iii,
both
parts
of
that
have
their
preemption
clauses.
and
title
iv,
which
amends
the
epaa,
amends
the
statute
that
has
its
own
preemption
clause,
and
it
does
not
preempt
explicitly.
so
it
is
not
as
if
congress
had
come
to
think
of
this
field
as
naturally
exclusively
federal.
congress
was
well
aware
in
1975
that
the
area
was
still
subject,
unless
it
displaced
the
traditional
police
powers
of
the
states
and
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico.
and
nevertheless,
no
one
suggested
that
the
extraordinary
result
of
preemption
in
the
absence
of
any
substantive
federal
rule
or
any
explicit
discussion
of
preemption
had
been
achieved.
this
did
not
occur
to
anyone.
and
the
only
possible
inference
from
that
is
that
no
one
thought
that
there
was
going
to
be
ongoing
preemption,
that
they
thought
that
the
epaa
as
amended
meant
what
this
court
thought
that
it
meant
in
tully
after
reading
it,
that
the
statute
was
over.
and
that
if
congress
wanted
to
revisit
the
question,
that
it
could
do
as
if
often
does
when
sunsets
a
piece
of
legislation
come
back
after
the
legislation
has
come
to
an
end.
teca
went
astray
because
of
its
misunderstanding
of
this
court's
opinion
in
transco,
and
in
particular
its
misunderstanding
of
the
context
of
the
discussion
of
this
court
on
which
it
drew.
transco
followed
northern
natural.
northern
natural
held
that
congress
had
occupied
the
field
of
wholesale
natural
gas
sales
and
pricing.
in
transco,
congress
had
withdrawn
ferc's
regulatory
authority
over
certain
categories
of
natural
gas.
the
court
in
transco
began
by
noting
that
after
the
natural
gas
policy
act,
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
natural
gas
policy
act
together,
remained
comprehensive
federal
regulation
of
this
field.
that
is
to
say
the
field
was
still
occupied.
and
hence,
unless
congress
said
otherwise
that
there
would
be
no
regulation
by
the
states.
the
court
then
inquired
whether
the
withdrawal
of
ferc's
regulatory
authority
indicated
that
congress
had
ceased
to
occupy
the
field
that
the
court
had
found
that
it
occupied
in
northern
natural.
the
court's
answer
in
transco
was
that
the
withdrawal
of
authority
was
not
to
that
purpose,
but
it
was
in
order
to
create
an
open
space
within
the
area
that
congress
continued
to
be
occupying.
now
when
congress
occupies
a
field,
what
it
does
in
effect
is
make
itself
into
the
sole
legislature
on
that
subject
matter.
that
is
it
displaces
the
normal
system
of
dual
government
where
both
congress
and
the
states
and
commonwealth
can
form
their
own
policy
and
says
that
only
congress
makes
policy
in
this
area,
and
only
congress
makes
the
law
in
this
area.
once
that
is
done,
it
naturally
follows
that
if
congress
decides
not
to
regulate
something,
then
of
course
it
is
not
going
to
be
regulated
at
all.
but
outside
the
context
of
occupation
of
the
field,
there
is
no
such
suggestion
and
there
is
no
such
suggestion
of
that
sort
in
transco.
transco
simply
found
that
congress
had
not
deoccupied
those
areas
of
the
field
that
it
had
deregulated.
there
is
also
the
suggestion
from
respondents
that
the
role
that
it
has
played
in
transco
by
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
natural
gas
policy
act
might
be
filled
in
this
case
by
the
other
titles
of
the
general
policy
of
the
epca.
but
as
mr.
coleman
noted,
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
general
congressional
policy
at
the
level
of
abstraction
that
it
has
found
in
the
epca
does
not
overcome
the
presumption
of
preemption.
and
indeed,
commonwealth
edison
v.
montana
addressed
the
specific
policy
of
the
epca,
of
one
of
the
epca's
substantive
provisions,
having
to
do
with
the
use
of
coal.
and
what
the
court
found
was
yes,
in
the
epca,
congress
took
certain
steps
in
favor
of
coal.
and
yes,
the
montana
severance
tax
could
raise
the
price
of
coal.
but
that
is
not
the
kind
of
clash
of
policies
that
will
lead
the
court
to
infer
preemption,
to
infer
that
congress
has
exercised
its
authority
to
move
aside
the
states.
rather
the
court
inferred
in
commonwealth
edison
and
should
infer
here
that
unless
it
has
made
it
clear,
congress
has
left
in
place
the
normal
relationship
between
the
levels
of
government.
congress
is
still
formulating
national
policy,
and
the
states
and
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
are
free
to
formulate
their
own
policy.
there
is
no
suggestion
to
the
contrary
anywhere
in
the
epaa.
and
therefore,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
