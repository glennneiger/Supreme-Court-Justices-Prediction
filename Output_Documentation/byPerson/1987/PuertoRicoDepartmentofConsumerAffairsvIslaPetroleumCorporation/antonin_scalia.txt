justice
scalia
you
conceive
of
it,
that
is
enough,
right?
justice
scalia
you
conceive
of
it
anyway,
so
it
is
not
inconceivable.
justice
scalia
how
do
you
apply
that
kind
of
analysis
to
the
sherman
act,
for
example,
where
we
have
just
had
a
case
argued
a
few
days
ago
about
the
sherman
act
preemption,
how
can
you
tell
when
congress
wants
to
create
a
free
market
to
eliminate
restraints
on
competition?
justice
scalia
i
am
talking
about
brown,
where
we
have
said,
well,
the
sherman
act
really
just
intended
to
set
forth
a
federal
policy,
and
we
do
not
read
it
as
meaning
the
states
cannot
do
what
we
have
said
at
the
federal
level
that
we
do
not
want
done.
justice
scalia
why
is
it
different
from
the
sherman
act?
justice
scalia
well,
you
know
the
sherman
act.
the
policy
was
simply
that
we
do
not
want
unreasonable
restraints
in
trade.
yet
we
have
always
interpreted
that
not
to
preclude
states
from
allowing
private
organizations
to
impose
restrictions,
as
long
as
the
states
adequately
supervise
them.
and
for
the
states
themselves
to
create
all
sorts
of
distortions
to
the
competitive
market.
now
were
those
cases
wrongly
decided;
and
if
not,
why
is
that
different
from
what
you
are
urging
on
us
here?
justice
scalia
of
course,
all
of
the
legislative
history
that
you
point
to
could
be
just
as
well
explained
by
a
congress
that
really
was
not
averting
to
state
regulation
at
all,
because
it
never
conceived
that
state
regulation
would
at
all
be
feasible
to
destroy
a
free
market.
perhaps
in
a
place
like
puerto
rico
or
maybe
alaska
and
maybe
hawaii,
but
certainly
in
the
continental
united
states,
do
you
think
that
you
can
have
local
state
regulation
that
could
possible
be
effective
given
that
the
interstate
channels
are
deregulated?
justice
scalia
i
mean
they
may
not
have
worried
about
it.
justice
scalia
they
assumed
that
when
they
passed
this
federal
statute
that
that
was
going
to
be
the
end
of
it.
because
as
a
practical
matter,
there
is
no
way
that
new
jersey
could
regulate
gasoline
unless
new
york,
and
pennsylvania,
and
neighboring
states
were
subject
to
the
same
regulation.
justice
scalia
no
federal
regulation
anyway.
justice
scalia
this
scheme
in
which
the
congress
was
remaining
involved
in
other
areas
of
regulation.
justice
scalia
of
course,
how
do
i
know
that
that
is
what
congress
has
in
mind,
to
sweep
the
field
and
leave
it
to
free
competition?
it
is
not
in
the
statute.
there
is
nothing
there
but
a
repeal
over
a
period
of
time
of
federal
intervention.
so
i
have
to
read
state
of
the
union
addresses
and
letters
from
the
president
to
various
senators
and
so
forth.
suppose
that
i
do
not
want
to
do
that.
suppose
i
think
that
the
preemption
of
state
authority
is
a
significant
enough
matter
that
it
ought
to
be
in
the
statute,
and
i
want
to
adopt
some
rule
that
would
let
the
congress
know
what
they
have
to
do.
do
you
think
that
it
would
be
better
to
have
a
rule
that
says
when
you
have
been
a
field
and
get
out
that
you
have
to
say
moreover
we
want
the
states
to
say
out
too;
or
would
it
make
more
sense
to
say
when
you
are
in
a
field
and
get
out
and
if
you
say
nothing,
we
will
assume
that
the
states
get
back
in,
where
should
the
presumption
be?
justice
scalia
you
want
me
to
read
state
of
the
union
addresses.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
here
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals.
petitioner
the
puerto
rico
department
of
consumer
affairs
issued
regulations
in
1986
regarding
the
price
of
gasoline,
which
regulations
were
opposed
by
the
respondents
several
oil
companies.
the
district
court
enjoined
enforcement
of
the
regulations
in
part
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
preempted
by
federal
law
and
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
reverse.
the
test
for
federal
preemptions
of
these
regulations
is
the
same
as
the
test
under
the
supremacy
clause
for
preemptions
of
the
law
of
the
state.
thus,
we
looked
to
the
scope
of
the
federal
statute.
the
court
below
found
preemptive
force
in
the
emergency
petroleum
allocation
act
of
1973
as
amended
by
the
energy
policy
and
conservation
act
of
1975.
that
law,
which
is
some
of
us
recall
was
once
the
basis
for
federal
controls
on
the
pricing
and
allocation
of
petroleum
products,
effectively
expired
in
1981.
the
court
below
nonetheless
found
that
it
had
continuing
preemptive
effect
on
the
theory
that
congress'
withdrawal
from
the
fields
signaled
an
intent
to
leave
the
market
for
petroleum
products
free
of
regulation
by
the
states.
however,
we
ordinarily
assume
that
the
historic
police
power
of
the
state
are
not
superseded
by
a
federal
act
unless
that
is
a
clear
and
manifest
purpose
of
congress.
there
is
no
such
clear
purpose
to
be
found
in
the
mere
expiration
of
the
statute
at
issue
much
less
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute.
our
decision
in
transcontinental
pipe
line
versus
state
oil
and
gas
board
did
not
alter
our
established
preemption
analysis.
there
is
no
federal
preemption
in
vacuo
without
a
constitutional
text
or
a
federal
statute
to
assert
it.
our
decision
is
unanimous
except
that
justice
o'connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
