chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
86-1406,
puerto
rico
department
of
consumer
affairs
versus
isla
petroleum
corporation.
mr.
coleman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coleman.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
harrison.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
harrison.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
evans.
chief
justice
rehnquist
who
do
those
two
questions
differ
so?
chief
justice
rehnquist
all
right.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
propose
kind
of
a
dichotomy
in
your
first
question.
should
the
question
be
did
the
congress
intend
to
create
a
free
market
in
petroleum
after
1981,
and
then
the
alternative
is
did
it
intend
to
preempt
state
regulation
after
1981,
and
what
is
the
difference
between
those
two
questions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
congress
may
have
had
in
mind
at
the
time
that
it
legislated
the
necessity
to
preempt
those
laws?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
framers
have
never
seen
congress
the
way
that
we
have.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
think
that
you
have
to
deal
with
some
of
the
contentions
that
the
petitioner
makes,
that
the
northern
natural
gas
case
in
1963
had
held
the
whole
area
preempted.
and
then
when
congress
backs
off
of
one
limited
section,
does
that
mean
that
the
states
are
now
free
to
come
in.
it
strikes
me
that
that
is
quite
different
than
congress
backing
off
entirely
the
way
that
it
did
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
puerto
rico
had,
had
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
sound
as
though
you
think
that
the
case
should
have
come
out
the
other
way.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
only
place
where
you
find
support
for
your
position
is
not
in
the
act,
but
in
the
debate.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
here
congress
got
into
the
business
of
regulating
gas
prices
on
1973.
before
that
time,
everybody
agrees
that
the
states
would
have
been
free
to
regulate.
they
got
out
of
the
business
in
1981.
why
should
it
not
revert
to
the
status
quo,
insofar
as
anything
that
congress
ever
enacted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
have
some
of
that
to
support
you,
but
that
seems
extremely
weak
when
you
do
not
have
a
single
sentence
of
an
enacted
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
law
that
repealed
all
congressional
involvement
in
the
area?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
evans.
mr.
coleman,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-1406,
puerto
rico
department
of
consumer
affairs
versus
isla
petroleum
corporation
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
