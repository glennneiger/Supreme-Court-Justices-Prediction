mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
will
come
as
no
surprise
to
you
that
we
see
the
case
somewhat
differently
from
the
way
that
my
colleagues
have
presented
it.
the
points
of
disagreement,
i
think,
are
numerous,
but
i
think
that
they
reduce
in
the
end
to
two.
one
deals
with
the
right
question
to
be
asked
here.
my
colleagues
believe
that
the
question
is
whether
congress
intended
in
1975
to
preempt
state
petroleum
regulation
after
1981.
we
think
that
the
question
is
whether
congress
in
1975
intended
to
create
a
market
free
of
government
regulation
after
1981.
and
if
so,
the
interference
of
puerto
rico
here
ought
to
be
preempted.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
have
not
gotten
to
the
second
question
yet.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
second
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
what
congress'
purpose
was
in
1975.
my
colleagues
see--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
the
difference
is
illustrated,
mr.
chief
justice,
by
the
definition
of
intention
to
preempt
that
is
given
in
this
case,
which
is
really
central
to
the
analysis
of
the
petitioners
and
the
solicitor
general.
and
that
definition
is
stated
most
clearly
at
page
9
of
the
reply
brief,
where
the
petitioners
say
that
what
must
be
shown
is
an
indication
that
congress,
and
these
are
the
words,
"had
in
mind
the
preemption
of
state
law
once
federal
controls
expired.
"
well,
even
if
intent
to
preempt
is
the
right
standard,
just
last
month
in
the
thompson
case,
the
parental
kidnapping
act
case,
the
court
rejected
precisely
that
kind
of
an
approach
to
a
question
of
congressional
intent.
it
said
in
connection
with
the
implication
and
the
finding
of
an
implied
cause
of
action
under
that
statute
that
while
congressional
intent
is
the
right
issue,
we
do
not
look
to
see
whether
congress
had
consciously
in
mind,
in
fact
that
was
the
exact
same
phrase
that
it
used,
that
the
court
used,
at
the
time
that
it
was
acting.
what
you
look
for
is
the
substantive
purposes
that
congress
had
in
mind.
now
under
our
analysis,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
guides
the
court
here
and
what
guides
the
parties
is
the
supremacy
clause.
the
supremacy
clause
makes
clear
how
you
meld
state
and
federal
laws
where
there
is
no
expression
of
congressional
intent
to
preempt.
you
look
at
the
congressional
act
and
its
substantive
purposes,
and
you
then
look
at
the
state
law
or
the
state
regulation.
and
if
its
effect
is
to
frustrate
the
purposes
sought
to
be
achieved
by
congress,
it
is
preempted,
because
it
is
contrary
to
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
exactly
right.
and
i
think
that
the
framers
probably
recognized
what
we
all
know,
which
is
that
congress
when
it
is
embroiled
in
debates
over
significant
national
policy
does
not
always
pause
to
think
what
effect
it
has.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
for
sure.
but
they
might
have
been
able
to
guess.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
the
court
has
always
since
gibbons
v.
ogden
and
continuing
most
recently
in
a
number
of
cases,
but
in
perex
v.
campbell,
dealing
specifically
with
the
question
of
whether
purpose
is
relevant.
the
only
purpose
that
is
relevant
is
the
substantive
purpose,
as
we
see
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
justice
scalia,
i
do
not
think
that
this
case
is
like
commonwealth
edison
or
exxon
v.
maryland
which
has
been
cited,
which
may
be
the
case
that
was
argued
the
other
day,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
question,
justice
scalia,
is
when
congress
enacted
in
this
case
the
epca
in
1975,
what
had
it
set
its
sights
on
and
what
means
did
it
choose
to
get
there.
what
it
set
its
sights
on
was
not
a
judgment
that
the
federal
government
was
not
doing
as
good
a
job
as
the
states
could
do.
it
was
not
a
judgment
that
we
have
lost
interest
in
the
area
of
energy,
but
quite
the
contrary.
it
was
a
burning
issue.
it
was
the
major
political
debate
of
the
year.
and
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
achieving
articulated
goals,
goals
that
were
set
forth
clearly
in
the
conference
report,
that
dealt
with
national
security,
preserving
our
independent
from
unstable
foreign
oil
supplies,
efficient
utilization
of
scarce
resources,
and
ensuring
availability
of
energy
resources
domestically
produced
at
reasonable
prices.
those
were
the
goals.
now
what
was
the
mechanism
that
it
chose
to
get
there.
the
principal
mechanism
which
was
central
to
the
entire
debate,
and
which
was
clearly
underlying
president
fords'
insistence
upon
his
position
and
the
congress'
ultimate
acquiescence
to
it
was
an
uncontrolled
and
unregulated
market.
the
whole
judgment
that
brought
the
issue
to
the
fore
was
the
conclusion
that
controls
were
doing
just
the
opposite.
controls
were
keeping
prices
low,
which
meant
that
consumption
went
up.
they
were
also
keeping
prices
low,
which
meant
production
went
down.
you
had
low
production
and
high
consumption,
and
the
balance
was
made
up
by
imported
oil
which
was
exactly
contrary
to
what
the
national
policy
ought
to
have
been.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
speak
conversantly
with
the
sherman
act.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
wish
that
i
were
better
prepared
to
respond
to
the
sherman
act.
i
just
do
not
have
a
feel
for
the
cases
and
what
analysis
led
the
court
to
those
conclusions,
nor
do
i
really
have
a
feel
for
the
underlying
purposes
that
may
have
been
exhibited
in
the
legislative
history.
i
do
think
that
the
closer
analogy
here
is
the
decision
in
the
natural
gas
area,
transco
which
has
been
referred
to.
we
think
that
really
this
case
is
transco
with
two
changes
to
it.
number
one,
this
is
total
deregulation
rather
than
partial.
and
number
two,
the
conflict
here
with
the
free
market
is
a
direct
one
and
not
a
remote
one.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
is
that
element
of
transco.
it
is
unquestionable
that
there
was
a
blend
in
the
decision,
the
majority
decision,
of
what
i
am
referring
to
as
conflict
preemption
principles,
the
question
of
whether
state
laws
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
federal
purposes,
and
field
preemption
principles
under
which
congress
basically
must
require
explicitly
assignment
of
regulatory
jurisdiction
exclusively
to
itself.
there
is
both
of
that.
and
it
is
true
that
the
context
was
northern
natural,
which
was
probably
a
field
preemption
case,
although
there
was
also
some
conflict
analysis
in
that.
but
the
conflict
analysis
in
transco
stands
on
its
own.
the
only
question
was
whether
the
rateable
take
order
which
was
not
a
well
head
price
regulation
measure
directly
anyway
was
in
fact
a
conflict
with
the
free
market
objectives
that
congress
had.
now
the
majority
of
the
court
felt
that
it
was.
but
it
obviously
reinforced
that
judgment
with
the
notion
that
even
if
it
was
not,
that
is
even
it
was
harmonious
with
the
federal
law,
this
was
a
kind
of
field
preemption
which
excludes
not
only
conflicting
state
law
but
also
harmonious
state
law.
i
think
that
there
was
a
blend
there,
but
i
think
that
had
the
case
been
different,
had
the
case
been
a
complete
deregulation
case,
had
congress
instead
of
just
picking
out
certain
categories
of
natural
gas
had
deregulated
all
natural
gas,
notwithstanding
the
background
of
northern
natural,
and
had
the
case
been
a
direct
well
head
price
regulation,
the
result
would
have
been
exactly
the
same.
and
it
would
have
been
unanimous,
if
i
understand
the
opinions.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
stevens.
our
view
is
that
there
must
be,
and
we
do
not
contest
this,
that
there
must
be
a
statute
enacted
by
congress
that
embodies
what
we
have
characterized
as
a
deregulatory
purpose.
we
cannot
apply
the
supremacy
clause
to
foreclose
state
law
in
the
absence
of
a
federal
statute,
but
there
was
a
federal
statute.
had
there
been
none,
had
the
debate
gone
forward
in
1975
and
resulted
in
nothing.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
that
is
what
was
happening
in
1975.
there
had
been
a
statute
enacted
in
1973,
and
the
question
was
what
was
going
to
happen
after
now
the
emergency
has
passed.
we
are
now
in
1975,
and
the
embargo
is
behind
us.
the
problems
are
gone.
now
we
are
deciding
what
is
going
to
be
the
future.
and
the
congress
in
1975
decided
that
the
future
was
going
to
be
deregulation.
we
are
going
to
have
unregulated
markets
where
the
price
mechanism
is
going
to
send
the
right
signals
to
consumers
and
producers.
but
we
cannot
do
it
overnight.
we
are
too
tied
to
the
controls
that
we
are
now
living
with.
we
have
to
do
it
in
a
gradual
way.
the
ultimate
compromise
which
was
a
difficult
and
hard
fought
one
with
vetoes
flying
back
and
forth
across
pennsylvania
avenue
was
that
congress
got
what
it
most
desired
which
was
temperance,
let
us
do
this
in
a
calm
measured
way,
let
us
deregulate
gradually
so
that
the
economy
can
adjust.
the
nation
was
just
recovering
from
a
deep
recession,
and
the
congress
was
very
concerned
for
obvious
reasons
about
the
impact
of
sudden
decontrol.
what
the
president
got
though
was
what
he
most
prized,
which
was
a
firm
commitment
by
congress
to
ultimate
deregulation,
so
that
the
price
mechanism
would
work,
and
that
the
economy
would
get
back
to
where
it
ought
to
be,
and
the
petroleum
markets
would
get
back
to
where
they
need
to
be.
now
my
colleagues
have
said,
both
of
them,
that
teca
has
gone
astray
and
misapplied
transco's
analysis
presuming
rather
than
inquiring
that
congress
intended
a
free
market.
not
so.
i
think
that
it
is
quite
unfair
to
read
teca's
opinion
that
way.
what
teca
held
was,
and
recognized
correctly
i
think,
that
what
this
court
found
in
transco
was
that
a
purpose
to
deregulate
or
a
decision
to
remove
federal
regulation
with
an
eye
towards
creating
a
free
market
environment
will
preempt
state
laws
that
interfere
with
market
forces.
it
defeats
the
congressional
purpose.
and
it
then
went
on
without
the
aid
of
any
presumption
and
looked
closely
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
epca
in
1975
and
found,
as
this
court
had
found,
in
transco
that
congress
in
fact
intended
markets
to
operate
freely,
that
that
was
the
heart
of
the
whole
debate.
and
it
further
found,
as
this
court
found
in
transco,
that
the
puerto
rico
regulation,
a
direct
price
fixing
regulation,
plainly
conflicts
with
the
congressional
purpose.
so
although
it
did
ask
the
same
question
in
the
course
of
its
opinion
that
this
court
suggested
was
appropriate,
the
question
being
did
congress
intend
to
give
the
states
any
authority
that
it
had
withdrawn
from
the
federal
government,
we
think
that
the
question
properly
understood
was
whether
notwithstanding
the
purpose
of
deregulation,
notwithstanding
the
purpose
to
create
a
free
market,
did
congress
intend
to
leave
the
states
free
to
interfere
with
the
state
market,
and
the
answer
to
that
question
was
plainly
no.
the
burden
ought
to
be
once
a
free
market
purpose
is
found
on
those
who
would
like
state
regulation
to
survive
to
show
that
congress
would
have
anticipated
state
regulation
notwithstanding
the
apparent
conflict.
and
the
court
has
occasionally
asked
that
question
and
found
that
kind
of
an
answer.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
do
not
think,
justice
scalia,
that
the
purposes
that
congress
articulated
could
be
squared
with
sporadic
regulation
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
any
more
than
a
national
regulation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
that
is
probably
right.
i
do
not
think
that
congress
really
thought
about
the
states.
it
was
not
an
issue.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
probably
was
not
an
issue
is
that
the
states
had
not
been
actively
regulating
petroleum
markets
before
1973
when
the
epaa
was
first
enacted.
but
the
fact
that
congress--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--puerto
rico
had.
but
i
am
not
sure
that
congress
focused
on
that,
or
it
might
well
have
addressed
the
issue
explicitly.
i
think
that
it
is
misguided
to
look
for
evidence
that
the
members
of
congress
voting
on
a
national
policy
thought
about
the
states
when
they
acted
to
establish
that
policy.
i
think
that
the
court's
decision
was
made
clear
under
the
hines
v.
davidowitz
standard
that
you
look
to
see
what
the
policy
was,
and
then
you
seen
whether
state
regulation
does
in
fact
conflict
with
it.
the
same
could
be
said,
in
fact
i
think
with
greater
vigor,
with
respect
to
the
congressional
decision
in
the
ngpa
that
was
at
issue
in
transco.
there
was
far
less
evidence
of
an
intent
to
create
a
free
market
which
was
the
heart
of
that
analysis
in
that
case.
there
was
a
snippet
from
one
of
the
legislative
reports
and
virtually
no
explanation
of
how
the
congress
expressed
a
deregulatory
purpose.
in
fact,
the
statute
itself
that
was
construed
simply
said
that
ferc
jurisdiction
shall
not
apply
after
a
certain
date
with
respect
to
one
category
of
natural
gas.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
no.
i
think
that
on
that
issue
that
all
nine
justices
agreed.
all
nine
justices
read
the
congressional
purpose
exactly
the
same
way.
whereas
in
our
case,
i
think
that
we
have
a
far
stronger
showing
of
what
congress
had
in
mind.
and
the
debates
which
we
have
laid
out
really
in
summary
fashion
that
goes
on
for
a
whole
year
in
1975
starting
with
president
ford's
state
of
the
union
message,
which
really
is
a
significant
element
of
his
entire
presentation
to
the
nation.
he
felt
that
it
was
critical
to
the
country
to
move
to
deregulated
markets.
there
was
a
debate,
and
congress
resisted
principally
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
a
good
idea
to
do
it
rapidly.
but
there
were
also
some
reservations
about
whether
there
really
was
a
free
market
with
the
opec
cartel
and
so
forth,
and
it
was
a
major
dispute.
ford
initially
sensed
some
resistance,
and
suggested
that
maybe
the
thing
to
do
is
to
phase
it
out,
and
deal
with
the
congressional
concerns
about
the
timing.
and
he
offered
two
years
as
a
phase-out
period.
congress
resisted
and
rejected
that,
and
said
that
it
needed
to
be
at
least
five
years.
but
at
that
point,
the
debate
shifted
from
the
question
of
whether
there
was
to
be
decontrol,
whether
markets
would
operate
freely,
to
the
question
of
when
they
were
going
to
operate
freely.
it
became
a
question
of
timing.
and
the
debate
raged,
and
congress
passed
a
bill
that
would
have
extended
and
exacerbated
in
president
ford's
mind
the
controls
that
were
already
on
the
books.
president
ford
vetoed
that,
and
offered
up
a
compromise
of
a
30
month
rather
than
a
two
year
deferral
of
decontrol
or
phase-out.
that
was
vetoed
by
the
house,
by
the
congress
in
a
one
house
veto.
ford
came
back
with
another
proposal
of
39
months.
that
again
was
vetoed.
at
this
point,
the
epaa
on
its
own
terms
having
been
extended
a
few
times
temporarily
comes
to
an
end
on
august
31,
1975.
and
there
is
suddenly
nothing
on
the
books.
congress
immediately
puts
forward
a
retroactive
revival
and
extension
for
a
short
period
of
time
of
the
act,
and
president
ford
vetoes
that.
but
he
says,
i
do
not
want
to
establish
policy
by
inaction,
this
is
too
important
an
area.
i
want
a
comprehensive
national
energy
policy
for
the
long
term,
and
i
want
a
responsible
approach
to
the
question
of
decontrol,
and
i
am
prepared
to
compromise.
i
will
accept
a
45
day
extension
of
these
controls
retroactively
revived
on
the
assurance
that
you
are
all
going
to
meet
with
me
to
compromise
on
it.
and
that
in
fact
is
exactly
what
happened.
his
veto
was
sustained
narrowly
by
the
senate.
a
compromise
was
struck
through
the
auspices
of
a
conference
committee.
and
what
emerged
was
a
statute
which
has
many
pieces
of
it,
and
most
of
them
are
not
particularly
relevant
to
the
question
of
decontrol.
but
decontrol
was
the
centerpiece
of
it.
and
what
congress
said
was
we
will
take,
although
we
are
going
to
postpone,
we
will
take
your
point
that
there
needs
to
be
decontrols.
but
we
are
going
to
do
it
in
the
course
of
three
steps.
and
this
was
basically
the
significant
section
of
the
statute
which
congress
enacted
with
respect
to
the
decontrol
provision.
i
believe
that
it
is
on
page
28
of
the
footnote
of
our
brief.
the
section
divides
the
phaseout
into
three
pieces.
the
first
piece
starts
right
away,
and
it
lasts
about
40
months.
and
during
that
period,
congress
maintains
full
control
over
the
question
of
petroleum
regulation.
it
is
on
page
28
in
footnote
8.
for
the
first
40
months,
the
president
must
maintain
mandatory
price
and
allocation
controls
on
petroleum
products.
during
that
time,
he
is
authorized
to
exempt
certain
products
from
regulation,
but
the
congress
has
a
one
house
veto.
this
is
not
necessarily
all
shown
in
this
section.
there
are
other
pieces
of
statute
which
add
a
bit
to
this.
at
the
end
of
the
40
month
period,
the
president's
obligation
to
maintain
regulation
evaporates.
and
the
regulation
becomes
entirely
discretionary
with
the
president,
and
the
congress
forsakes
control
with
respect
to
the
one
house
veto.
at
the
end
then
of
another
30
months,
basically
after
six
years
after
enactment
of
the
epca,
all
presidential
authority
expires,
and
presumably
regulation
is
gone.
now
one
thing
that
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
first
of
all,
the
statute
itself
while
it
is
belittled
by
my
colleagues,
the
statute
itself
clearly
had
a
direction
in
it.
the
section
that
we
are
talking
about
moves
from
regulation
to
deregulation
in
a
phased
group.
there
is
something
going
on
there,
and
there
is
a
target.
the
target
is
no
regulation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no
federal
regulation.
now
that
is
what
my
colleagues
see
here,
nothing
but
the
withdrawal
of
federal
regulation.
but
as
we
have
discussed
a
few
moments
ago,
the
same
argument
was
really
made
and
accepted
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
transco.
that
was
exactly
the
argument
that
the
state
made
there.
all
that
happened
in
transco
was
that
congress
removed
federal
controls
over
well
head
regulation.
now
why
should
that
prevent
the
state
from
stepping
in
and
doing
whatever
it
is
doing,
whatever
it
wants
to
do.
and
the
response
that
the
court
gave
in
transco
is
exactly
the
right
response.
and
it
fits
whether
we
are
talking
about
field
preemption
or
conflict
preemption.
what
the
court
said,
and
it
had
a
conflict
flavor,
was
that
what
the
federal
government
was
doing
was
removing
the
distorting
effects
of
price
controls.
the
court's
words
may
have
been
artificially
formalistic
to
assume,
those
were
the
court's
words
i
believe,
that
congress
expected
that
the
states
would
then
step
in
and
start
doing
the
same
thing.
it
would
have
defeated
the
entire
purpose.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
do
not
think
that
part
of
the
analysis,
justice
scalia,
is
pegged
to
the
field
preemption
notion.
it
really
was
a
conflict
preemption
notion,
and
it
works
here
too.
why
is
it
appropriate
that
congress
has
in
mind
allowing
the
price
of
product
to
send
the
right
signals
all
the
way
through
the
market,
and
why
is
it
appropriate
for
the
states
to
interfere
with
those
signals.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is.
i
think
that
the
court's
decisions
make
it
clear
that
it
ought
not
be.
the
other
suggestion--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--i
do
not
think
that
it
is
in
either
place.
i
think
that
the
court--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--well,
i
would
hate
to
suggest
that
every
piece
of
legislative
interpretation
requires
a
resort
to
the
state
of
the
union
addresses.
it
just
happens
to
be
that
this
act
was
the
product
of
debate,
vigorous
debate
between
the
president
on
the
one
side
and
the
congress
on
the
other
all
through
the
year.
that
is
where
the
whole
process
started.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
it
is
in
the
act
too,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
see
it
in
the
act.
we
do
not
see
the
expression
that
the
states
are
foreclosed,
but
that
has
never
been
required
in
the
context
of
conflict
preemption.
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
conflict-preemption
has
no
place
in
the
context
of
deregulation,
then
i
think
that
the
principles
that
have
been
established
in
connection
with
regulation
apply
here
as
well.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
let
us
look
if
i
can,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
some
part
of
what
as
said
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
history
leading
to
the
1975
legislation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
are
many
cases
in
which
this
court
has
applied
a
hines
v.
davidowitz
kind
of
preemption
analysis.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
this
is
the
only
case
in
which
we
have
complete
deregulation.
and
the
question,
i
think,
is
properly
framed.
whether
the
standard
that
has
been
applied
in
connection
with
regulatory
statutes
should
shift
when
you
have
a
regulatory
statute.
it
does
not
matter.
in
transco,
does
it
matter
how
much
regulation
there
was,
would
it
have
changed
the
result.
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
have
had
there
been
complete
deregulation
of
natural
gas
prices.
i
think
that
the
result
would
have
been
the
same,
because
the
purpose
would
have
been
the
same.
and
this
court's
obligation
under
the
supremacy
clause
is
to
apply
the
congressional
purpose.
sometimes
it
is
clear
in
the
statute.
sometimes
congress
goes
out
of
its
way
to
assign
and
to
allocate
responsibility
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
has
not
done
it
in
many
cases.
and
in
those
cases,
the
court
has
to
carry
the
burden
of
looking
to
the
congressional
purpose.
sometimes
you
have
to
look
harder
than
other
times.
this
is
a
pretty
easy
one.
now
one
other
point
that
i
think
is
important
to
stress
is
that
the
result
of
preemption
here
is
not
the
blanket
immunity
that
my
colleagues
suggest.
it
is
very
closely
confined
the
only
thing
that
the
district
court
preempted
was
price
controls.
and
this
case
would
not
lead
to
a
preemption,
for
example,
of
a
rateable
take
order
in
the
crude
oil
area.
it
just
would
not
happen.
what
we
have
here,
i
think,
is
a
crystal
clear
framing
of
the
limits
of
preemption.
and
it
is
consistent
with
what
we
think
is
the
right
principle,
which
is
that
when
you
are
trying
to
find
out
whether
a
particular
state
regulation
is
or
is
not
preempted
under
the
hines
standard
deregulation
context,
you
look
to
see
what
was
removed
by
congress,
what
was
it
focusing
on,
what
was
the
mechanism
that
it
chose
to
get
where
it
wanted
to
go.
what
congress
removed
here
were
price
regulations
and
allocation
regulations
of
petroleum
and
petroleum
products.
that
is
what
is
preempted
and
ought
to
be
preempted.
beyond
that,
we
do
not
suggest
nor
do
the
courts
below
suggest
that
the
supremacy
clause
goes.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
