mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
preemption
case,
the
issue
being
whether
puerto
rico's
regulation
of
gasoline
marketing
is
preempted
by
an
alleged
congressional
purpose
to
create
a
completely
free
market
for
petroleum
products.
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals
found
that
such
a
purpose
was
exhibited
in
congress'
termination
of
federal
controls,
and
that
such
purpose
banned
state
actions,
and
accordingly
affirmed
the
district
court
judgment
which
had
preempted
puerto
rico's
regulations.
now
there
are
a
few
points
which
i
do
not
believe
are
in
dispute
which
i
think
should
be
mentioned
at
the
outset
by
way
of
background.
first,
no
commerce
clause
issue
has
been
raised.
the
regulation
that
we
are
concerned
with
is
internal
economic
regulation
in
puerto
rico
which
is
at
the
end
of
the
supply
distribution
chain.
now
before
passage
of
the
emergency
petroleum
allocation
act
in
1973,
i
think
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
states
could
engage
in
regulation
of
this
type.
it
would
be
within
the
historic
police
powers
reserved
to
the
states.
and
in
fact,
puerto
rico
did
so
for
about
twenty
years
in
a
form
quite
similar
in
general
terms
at
least
to
that
which
was
attempted
here.
now
under
the
epaa,
as
i
say
was
passed
in
1973
in
response
to
the
arab
embargo,
a
temporary
statute,
there
was
preemption
of
conflicting
state
laws,
and
certainly
puerto
rico's
own
regulations
were
preempted
at
that
time.
but
i
do
not
think
that
anyone
contends
that
if
that
statute
had
expired
on
its
planned
expiration
date
that
there
would
have
been
any
carry-over
preemption
thereafter.
so
we
are
focusing
here
today
on
what
happened
in
1975
when
congress
in
the
energy
policy
and
conservation
act
or
the
epca,
as
we
call
it,
amended
the
epaa
in
title
iv
of
the
epca.
now
this
question
has
previously
been
before
this
court
in
the
tully
case
in
1981
and
1982,
and
this
court
held
in
an
order
vacating
a
teca
opinion
that
there
after
the
expiration
of
federal
authority
on
september
30,
1981
that
there
would
be
no
preemption.
teca,
however,
decided
that
it
could
depart
from
tully
here,
which
it
acknowledged
would
otherwise
be
controlling,
because
it
decided
that
the
issue
had
not
been
fully
considered
by
this
court,
and
because
it
felt
that
it
had
received
contrary
instructions
in
the
subsequent
transco
opinion,
which
it
decided
was
applicable
here,
because
the
epca
revision
of
the
epaa
involved
a
deregulatory
statute
similar
to
what
it
considered
had
been
done
in
the
natural
gas
policy
act
which
revised
the
natural
gas
act,
which
was
considered
in
the
transco
opinion.
our
position
is
that
the
two
statutes
involved
in
transco
and
this
case
are
completely
different.
as
a
consequence,
transco
is
distinguishable.
and
i
will
discuss
the
statutory
point
more
in
a
moment.
and
secondly,
we
think
that
teca
misread
this
court's
application
of
preemption
concepts
in
transco.
and
principally,
i
think
that
this
occurs
because
the
court
ignored
the
fact
that
in
the
northern
natural
case
decided
some
twenty
years
earlier,
this
court
had
held
that
congress
preempted
the
field,
occupied
the
field,
in
natural
gas
regulation
through
passage
of
the
natural
gas
act.
now
teca
was
obviously
influenced
by
the
way
that
this
court
asked
the
question
as
to
what
was
before
it
in
transco.
it
said
in
revising
a
comprehensive
statute
to
give
market
forces
a
more
important
role,
did
the
congress
intend
to
allow
the
states
to
step
in
and
act.
and
teca
decided
that
it
should
ask
a
similar
question
here,
and
look
for
evidence
that
the
congress
had
actually
intended
to
allow
the
states
to
act
after
the
federal
controls
expired.
but
as
i
said,
in
transco,
this
court
had
before
it
a
statute
which
had
been
held
to
occupy
the
field.
now
it
has
been
made
clear
in
a
number
of
cases
that
where
congress
occupies
the
field
that
within
the
boundaries
of
that
occupation
that
it
is
presumed
that
the
states
will
not
be
able
to
act
unless
congress
has
told
them
that
they
can
act.
i
mean
i
think
that
is
clear
from
a
number
of
cases.
but
where
you
do
not
have
that
kind
of
situation,
which
is
what
we
have
got
here.
i
mean
the
allegation
here
is
that
there
is
a
conflict
with
a
congressional
purpose,
not
that
congress
occupied
the
field
in
the
epaa.
it
is
far
from
it.
there
was
an
express
preemption
clause
that
said
you
preempt
in
the
case
of
conflict.
so
do
not
think
that
the
preemption
analysis
that
this
court
utilized
when
it
asked
that
question
that
teca
was
so
influenced
by
that
that
is
applicable
to
this
kind
of
case.
to
the
contrary,
i
think
that
this
court's
usual
rule,
which
it
has
applied
when
it
is
making
the
initial
determination
of
preemption,
that
applies
either
in
an
occupation
case
or
a
conflict
case,
that
you
start
with
the
assumption
that
the
historic
police
powers
were
not
to
be
superceded
unless
that
was
the
clear
and
manifest
purpose
of
congress.
that
was
a
quotation
from
rice
v.
santa
fe
in
1947,
and
it
has
been
referred
to
any
number
of
times
subsequently,
as
recently
as
international
paper
decided
in
the
last
term
where
it
was
referred
to
as
a
presumption
that
the
state
law
was
valid,
if
it
was
an
area
traditionally
reserved
to
the
states.
our
position
is
that
congressional
silence
of
ambiguity
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
state
law
and
not
against
it.
i
think
that
teca
erred
in
doing
exactly
the
opposite.
now
if
you
look
at
what
congress
did
in
the
epca
amendment,
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
support
for
the
conclusion
that
teca
reached.
and
specifically,
we
think
that
teca
erred
in
its
reading
of
the
legislative
history
and
certain
inferences
that
it
drew
therefrom.
and
it
concluded
that
congress
in
allowing
a
statute
to
expire
or
more
precisely
providing
for
its
expiration
after
time
intended
to
create
a
completely
free
market
that
would
bind
the
states
thereafter
and
prevent
any
state
regulation
of
petroleum
prices.
if
you
look
at
the
context
in
which
the
epca
amendment
occurred,
you
find
president
ford
wanting
the
epaa
expire.
and
he
asked
for
new
standby
authority
which
he
can
invoke
in
the
case
of
an
emergency,
but
otherwise
not.
i
do
not
think
that
anybody
would
argue
that
if
president
ford's
wishes
had
been
granted
and
the
epaa
had
been
allowed
to
expire
that
there
would
be
any
preemption
as
a
result
of
that
at
all.
the
house
wanted
long-term
or
permanent
regulations,
they
said.
they
would
keep
the
epaa
with
some
modifications
for
ten
years,
and
then
convert
to
standby
emergency
authority.
the
senate
pretty
well
agreed
with
the
president,
and
wanted
to
remove
the
mandatory
controls
promptly
followed
by
a
short
period
of
standby
authority.
now
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
none
of
the
participants
in
this
compromise
negotiation
which
occurred
were
asking
for
a
completely
free
market
or
were
asking
for
state
preemption
after
the
epaa
authority
expired.
there
is
just
not
a
word
to
support
that,
and
the
context
is
the
contrary.
secondly,
the
state
preemption
after
epaa
expiration
was
never
mentioned
in
the
hearings.
this
was
a
subject
examined
extensively.
and
not
in
the
debates,
and
not
in
any
of
the
reports
of
the
committees
of
the
house
and
the
senate,
and
certainly
not
in
the
conference
report.
and
if
you
look
at
the
amendment,
the
epca
amendment,
there
is
certainly
no
statutory
provision.
they
either
expressly
or
by
implication
require
preemption.
i
think
that
teca
focused
on
the
structure
of
the
epca
amendment,
and
found
some
evidence
to
support
its
conclusion
there.
now
what
was
done
in
the
epca
amendment
was
to
take
the
mandatory
controls
which
had
been
required
in
the
epaa
and
continue
them
for
a
period
of
40
months.
those
would
then
be
converted
to
a
standby
status
for
a
period
of
28
months,
and
that
gets
you
to
september
30,
1981
when
the
statute
in
section
18
plainly
provides
that
all
regulatory
authority
expires.
now
the
president
had
the
authority
under
that
scheme
to
remove
on
a
product
by
product
basis
individual
petroleum
products
from
controls
during
the
first
40
month
period.
and
during
the
standby
period,
he
could
remove
controls
or
reimpose
them
at
will;
in
other
words,
pursuant
to
his
own
discretion.
now
teca
found
in
its
work
that
it
was
inconceivable
that
congress
would
go
to
the
trouble
of
phasing
out
federal
controls
with
the
intention
that
the
states
could
step
in.
now
they
do
not
cite
anything
to
support
that
inference.
but
it
seems
to
us,
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
the
court's
opinion
on
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
case--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
--what
is
that?
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes.
this
court
said
in
that
case
that
it
was
inconceivable
that
congress
would
intend
to
create
a
regulatory
vacuum,
certainly
without
addressing
it
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
raises
a
question
whether
you
can
really
have
preemptive
effect
from
a
congressional
intent
or
a
congressional
purpose
which
is
not
either
embodied
in
the
statute
or
flows
from
the
construction
of
a
statute.
and
frankly,
we
have
neither
here.
i
am
not
aware
of
another
case
where
that
has
ever
been
held.
now
the
epca
conference
report
was
a
very
carefully
worded
compromise.
i
think
that
the
court
should
be
cautious
about
reading
other
things
into
it.
and
if
you
look
at
the
purpose
clause,
it
does
not
say
a
word
about
creating
a
free
market
and
nothing
about
state
preemption.
if
you
look
at
the
summary
of
what
was
to
be
done
in
title
iv,
the
epca
amendment,
there
is
nothing
in
there
about
free
market
or
carry-over
preemption.
if
you
look
at
the
section
dealing
with
conversion
of
mandatory
authority
to
stand-by
authority,
there
are
two
isolated
references
to
an
unregulated
market.
now
the
first
of
these,
the
conferees
said
that
we
still
have
a
problem
in
this
country,
but
it
is
different.
it
is
not
like
it
was
in
1973.
indeed,
supplies
had
returned
to
conditions
as
they
were
in
1972.
there
was
a
sufficiency
of
supplies,
but
they
thought
that
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
to
move
to
prompt
decontrol.
and
they
said,
"a
gradual
return
to
an
unregulated
market
is
preferable
to
sudden
decontrol.
"
the
context
is
saying
that
gradual
is
better
than
sudden.
but
if
you
focus
on
the
phrase
epaa
was
passed.
the
other
phrase
appears
on
the
next
page.
and
the
congress
said
that
we
still
have
a
problem,
that
we
remain
vulnerable
to
interruptions.
and
that
it
is
possible
that
if
we
had
another
embargo
that
we
would
have
a
serious
problem.
and
they
noted
that
the
president
had
asked
for
standby
emergency
authority.
"better
that
we
should
convert
the
epaa
to
standby
authority
than
to
write
a
new
bill.
"
is
what
they
said.
so
you
have
this
second
reference
that
teca
found
significant
which
says
that,
"extension
of
the
epaa
and
its
conversion
to
a
standby
authority
offers
in
addition
the
potential
for
a
smooth
transition
of
petroleum
markets
from
a
closely
regulated
state
to
a
largely
unregulated
status
subject
to
standby
pricing
and
allocation
authority.
"
now
the
context
is
clearly
talking
about
the
situation
before
controls
expire
in
1981
rather
than
thereafter.
because
when
it
says
30,
1981.
but
i
would
submit
that
the
phrase
"largely
unregulated"
is
not
inconsistent
with
there
being
a
removal
of
federal
controls
and
some
state
regulation.
it
certainly
does
not
say
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
completely
free
market.
and
in
the
face
of
evidence
like
this,
i
would
urge
the
court
to
be
guided
by
what
it
said
in
cases
like
commonwealth
edison
v.
montana,
and
exxon
v.
governor
of
maryland
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
where
it
said
that
you
cannot
rely
on
general
expressions
of
national
policy.
that
instead
you
must
look
for
something
specific
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history.
now
the
respondents
argue,
well,
admittedly
the
epaa
has
expired,
that
there
is
no
authority
there
for
preemption.
but
that
epca
amendment
was
part
of
a
larger
statute,
and
some
of
those
titles
are
still
in
effect.
under
title
i
of
epca,
it
created
the
strategic
reserve.
it
is
not
related
to
general
price
and
allocation
controls
under
the
epaa.
in
title
ii,
the
president
is
given
some
authority
to
deal
with
international
emergency
through
participation
in
the
international
energy
plan,
rationing,
conservation,
and
the
like.
one
thing
that
strikes
you
is
that
these
other
provisions
of
epca
are
regulatory
in
nature.
they
do
not
say
a
word
about
creating
a
completely
free
market,
nor
in
any
respect
do
they
require
a
free
market
for
their
operation.
and
if
you
look
at
title
v
of
epca,
it
had
a
clause
which
dealt
with
the
effect
of
state
laws
under
titles
i
and
ii,
which
clearly
indicated
that
the
congress
when
it
was
concerned
with
preemption
that
it
addressed
the
subject
specifically.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
thank
you.
counsel
for
the
respondents
concedes
that
there
is
no
clear
evidence
of
an
attempt
to
preempt
state
regulation
as
such,
but
argues
that
that
is
really
beside
the
point,
if
there
is
clear
evidence
of
an
intent
to
create
a
completely
free
market,
which
as
a
consequence
would
have
the
effect
of
preempting.
now
let
us
focus
on
his
contention
that
there
is
such
a
purpose
to
create
a
completely
free
market.
i
submit
that
he
spent
most
of
his
time
talking
about
that
it
could
be
that
if
congress
had
such
a
purpose
that
it
would
follow
the
preemption
would
occur.
i
suggest,
however,
that
he
has
given
you
very
little
evidence
in
briefs
or
in
argument
of
anywhere
in
this
entire
debate
that
you
can
find
that
congress
intended
to
have
a
completely
free
market
following
the
end
of
federal
controls.
it
is
certainly
not
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
and
it
is
not
in
the
purpose
clause,
and
i
cannot
see
it
in
the
structure
of
the
statute.
it
was
never
mentioned
in
the
debates
that
we
can
find.
and
they
talk
about
president
ford's
objective.
president
ford
sent
to
the
congress
a
stand-by
emergency
measure,
title
xxii
of
his
own
bill,
which
would
have
called
for
stand-by
authority
for
ten
years.
and
it
had
a
preemption
clause
in
it
that
said
in
section
1320
in
essence
that
if
we
invoke
that
authority
that
we
would
preempt,
but
that
we
would
not
preempt
otherwise.
now
if
that
was
what
the
president
wanted,
that
he
wanted
some
stand-by
authority,
and
he
wanted
merely
to
allow
the
epaa
to
expire,
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
he
had
in
mind
that
in
the
meantime
that
there
would
be
no
state
regulation
at
all.
we
submit
that
none
of
the
participants
in
that
debate
had
in
mind
an
intent
which
would
result
in
preemption
here.
an
idea
that
you
should
deregulate
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
you
want
to
preempt.
i
mean
the
reagan
administration,
and
this
is
detailed
in
our
brief,
has
consistently
opposed
federal
past
regulation
and
strongly
believes
in
market
forces.
but
on
every
occasion
when
the
administration
came
to
the
congress
to
discuss
whether
or
not
there
ought
to
be
preemption
and
in
following
the
expiration
of
the
epaa,
there
was
quite
an
interchange
between
the
congress
and
the
administration,
they
took
the
position
one,
that
there
was
not
any
preemption
at
the
present
time;
and
two,
that
there
should
not
be
any
preemption,
even
though
they
believed
in
deregulation.
so
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
deregulation
equals
preemption.
now
finally,
in
this
case,
they
say,
well,
we
do
not
have
to
show
preemptive
intent,
but
we
merely
have
to
show
a
deregulatory
purpose.
since
the
entire
statute
was
wiped
out
of
all
of
its
federal
authority
in
september
of
1981,
the
only
thing
that
could
have
been
left
over
which
you
need
to
do
to
create
a
free
market
would
be
to
preempt
the
states.
so
i
suggest
that
the
two
are
one
and
the
same.
so
when
you
look
for
evidence
here
to
support
preemption,
it
does
not
matter
whether
you
call
it
looking
for
a
congressional
purpose
to
create
a
free
market,
or
looking
for
evidence
to
create
preemption,
but
it
really
is
the
same
thing.
if
i
could
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
transco
case.
as
i
understand,
he
concedes
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
northern
natural
decision
and
take
account
of
the
fact
that
you
are
dealing
with
an
occupation
of
the
field
there.
i
think
that
makes
the
case
distinguishable.
in
transco,
there
was
clear
evidence
that
congress
wanted
the
narrow
category
of
deep
cast
to
be
deregulated.
they
wanted
to
provide
an
incentive
for
more
of
its
development.
and
that
is
distinguishable.
