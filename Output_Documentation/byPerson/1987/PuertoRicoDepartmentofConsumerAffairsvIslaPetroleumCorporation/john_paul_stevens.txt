justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question.
if
i
understood
your
opening
comments,
you
said
that
the
question
was
whether
in
1975
congress
intended
that
there
be
a
free
market
after
1981.
does
that
mean
contrary
to
what
your
opponents
said
that
you
would
really
contend
that
there
was
preemption
even
if
the
statute
had
expired
by
its
terms?
justice
stevens
then
you
are
really
arguing
that
preemption
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
repeal
or
the
amendment?
justice
stevens
no,
no,
i
did
not
say
if
there
had
been
nothing.
i
just
said
that
if
they
had
enacted
the
statute
in
1975
and
then
let
it
expire
by
its
term.
