chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
number
86-6139,
clara
watson
v.
fort
worth
bank
and
trust.
mr.
brender,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
he
justifies
it
by
showing
job-related.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
he
doesn't
rebut
any
notion
of
intent
directly.
chief
justice
rehnquist
or
he
could
show,
as
i
understand
it,
that
even
if
there
is
an
impact,
there
is
a
job-related
reason
for
giving
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
brender,
the
sort
of
system
that
you
suggest
for
validating
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
may
be
find
for
a
company
like
the
fort
worth
bank
and
trust
company
that
has
a
number
of
employees.
how
about
an
employer
who
employs
just
a
minimum
number
that's
subject
to
title
vii?
is
he
supposed
to
go
through
all
of
that,
too?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
it,
fifteen
people
or
twenty
people?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
would
a
small
employer
of
twenty
people,
how
could
he
validate,
you
know,
that
sort
of
subjective
system
that
i
think
most
of
those
employers
probably
use?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
even
an
employer
of
twenty
people
would
have
to
go
to
studies
and
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
he
doesn't
know
at
any
given
time
whether
his
practices
may
be
shown
to
have
a
disparate
impact
or
not.
i
take
it
that
doesn't
depend
on
intent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
brender.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
mcgee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcgee.
mr.
brender,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
brender.
the
case
is
submitted.
