justice
scalia
well,
why?
why
is
it
any
different
from
the
ordinary
case?
let's
say
you
have
an
employer
who
will
not
hire
blacks.
he
turns
down
five
blacks
for
a
single
job
and
hires
a
white
individual
for
it.
wouldn't
each
one
of
those
five
blacks
have
a
cause
of
action?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
just
one
would?
justice
scalia
what
good
is
the
cause
of
action
without
relief?
what
do
you
mean?
they
have
a
cause
of
action
for
what?
justice
scalia
anyway,
i
suppose
your
answer
to
all
this
is
if
this
is
a
problem,
it's
not
a
problem
you're
creating,
this
must
be
a
problem
under
griggs,
too.
justice
scalia
well,
not
necessarily.
it
may
be
wrong.
i
mean,
isn't
the
big
difference
between
validation
under
the
impact
test
and
what
you
urge
be
applied
here,
isn't
the
big
difference
that
the
employer,
if
he's
using
an
objective
test
under
griggs,
he
has
to
be
right?
he
has
to
be
not
merely...
the
reason
he
failed
to
hire
this
individual
has
to
be
not
merely
something
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
racial
discrimination
or
any
other
unlawful
discrimination,
but
it
has
to
be
correct.
justice
scalia
whereas,
under
your
theory,
this
bank
would
be
entirely
entitled
to
put
the
wrong
people
in
the
position,
so
long
as
they
didn't
pick
the
wrong
people
because
of
racial
animus
or
sex
animus.
justice
scalia
you're
not
asserting
that
you
established
below
or
that
the
court
thought
you
established
below
that,
in
fact,
your
system's
a
good
one,
that
you're
picking
the
best
people?
all
the
court
really
found
is
that
it
may
be
terrible,
but
whatever
is
terrible
about
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
racial
or
sexual
animus.
justice
scalia
mr.
mcgee,
i'm
not
sure
that
validation
of
an
objective
test
is
a
very
simple
operation
either.
i
mean,
i've
heard
argument
in
other
cases
bemoening
the
difficulty
of
validating
an
objective
test
and
what
many
employers
in
that
situation
simply
say
is
just
what
you've
said,
that
the
way
to
solve
the
problem
is
simply
to
make
sure
that
whatever
kind
of
an
objective
test
you
apply,
it
ends
up
with
a
work
force
that
is
more
or
less
balanced
by
race,
by
sex,
and
so
forth.
now,
what's
the
reason
for
treating
your
employer
differently
just
because
he's
using
a
subjective
test?
i
mean,
i
gather
that
we've
made
the
decision
that
if
you
use
an
objective
test,
you
not
only
have
to
be
free
of
discrimination,
you
have
to
be
right.
you
have
to
be
using
tests
that
really
do
work
to
get
the
best
people.
why
should...
morally,
why
should
we
have
a
different
test
for
subjective
employers?
justice
scalia
the
fact
is
that
it's
doable
for
an
objective
test,
but
the
cost
of
doing
it
is
usually
more
than
the
cost
of
simply
adopting
a
relatively
balanced
work
force,
and
it's
my
impression
that
that's
the
way
most
employers
meet
the
problem,
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
i
see
no
difference
between
their
situation
and
your
client's.
justice
scalia
actually,
that's
a
bad
example.
that
would
be
easy
to
validate.
you
would
pick
the
masochist,
i
think.
no.
i
was
going
to
say
if
i
did
that,
maybe
i'd
have
better
law
clerks.
