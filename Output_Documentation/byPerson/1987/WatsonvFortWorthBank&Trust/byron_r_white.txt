suppose
the
court
had
allowed
you,
what
would
you
have
done?
justice
white
well,
what
would
you
have
done?
you
said
the
court
wouldn't
let
you
analyze
it
under
disparate
impact.
what
if
it
had
said
okay,
go
ahead,
what
would
you
have
done?
justice
white
what
would
you
have
said?
justice
white
well,
how
would
you...
how
could
you
have
won
the
case?
justice
white
so
that
in
disparate
impact
case,
you
really
don't
need
to
prove
intent,
do
you?
justice
white
and
in
disparate
treatment,
you
do?
justice
white
in
the
disparate
impact,
is
the
bottom
line,
nevertheless,
intent
in
the
sense
that
the
employer
must
justify
as
in
griggs
or
what
do
you
conclude,
intent
or--
justice
white
and
if
he
fails
to
do
that,
he's
liable
not
because
he
intends
anything,
but
because
as
the
law
is
interpreted,
intended
to
give
relief--
justice
white
--griggs,
i
guess.
justice
white
did
not
prevail
on
discrimination.
justice
white
what
was
that?
justice
white
what
is
the
eeoc's
view?
justice
white
have
they
always
had
that
view?
justice
white
well,
what
was
its
view
immediately
before
the
present
view?
justice
white
well,
it
shouldn't
be
too
long.
justice
white
including
subjective?
justice
white
we
won't
quote
you.
justice
white
well,
the
solicitor
general,
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
eeoc
and
the
united
states,
said
that
the
subjective
methods
must
be
justified,
need
only
be
shown
that
the
selection
procedure
is
reasonably
related
to
the
requirements
of
the
job
or
other
business
needs,
and
has
been
applied
in
a
non-pretextural
fashion.
that's
what
its
brief
says.
justice
white
let
me
just
ask
you.
assume
that
that
is
the
right
test,
assume
that
that
is
the
right
test,
was
that
test
satisfied
in
this
case?
was
that
kind
of
a
justification
offered?
justice
white
or
found
or
applied
by--
justice
white
--what
i'm
trying
to
find
out,
if
that's
the
test...
was
that
the
test
that
was
applied
in
this
case
by
the
courts
below
or
not?
