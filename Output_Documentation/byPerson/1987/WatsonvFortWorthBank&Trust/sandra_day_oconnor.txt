justice
o'connor
well,
we
don't
have
a
hiring
case
anymore,
do
we?
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
all
that's
left
now
is
the
promotion
aspect
for
an
individual
plaintiff?
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
we're
not
concerned
with
that
here?
justice
o'connor
mr.
brender,
i
assume
that
the
proof
offered
as
trial,
the
statistical
evidence,
is
exactly
the
same
evidence
that
would
be
offered
either
under
a
disparate
treatment
or
a
disparate
impact
case.
justice
o'connor
and
if
it
were
remanded,
you
wouldn't
have
different
proof,
it
would
still
be
the
same
statistical
evidence?
justice
o'connor
so,
what
is
really
at
stake
here?
does
it
turn
on
the
different
burden
of
proof
aspects
under
the
two
types
of
cases?
does
it
turn
on
what
the
defendant's
burden
is
to
rebut
the
statistics,
in
effect?
is
that
how
you
see
the
bottom
line?
justice
o'connor
well,
we
haven't
said
that,
have
we?
justice
o'connor
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
there's
any
difference
at
all
in
the
initial
burden
of
proof
under
the
two
types
of
cases.
justice
o'connor
so,
the
courts
below,
although
you
have
the
statistical
evidence,
decline
to
even
treat
it
as
a
pattern
and
practice
case--
justice
o'connor
--because
the
class
was
discharged,
she
wasn't
representative
of
the
class?
justice
o'connor
--but
under
a
pattern
and
practice
case,
you
don't
directly
prove
intent.
you
offer
statistics
as
evidence
of...
from
which
the
trier
of
fact
could
infer.
justice
o'connor
right?
justice
o'connor
and
in
actuality,
the
proof
is
much
the
same
from
the
plaintiff's
side,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
my
impression
is
that
the
plaintiff's
initial
proof
would
be
exactly
the
same
and
what
you
might
be
quibbling
about
is
what
the
defendant's
burden
then
is
under
the
two
types,
and
i
guess
we
haven't
spoken
to
that,
really.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
brender,
isn't
there
something
short
of
this
so-called
validation
that
would
suffice
to
determine
or
establish
that
a
particular
employer's
system
of
evaluating
or
promoting
employees
is
generally
fair
and
uniformly
applied?
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
body
of
case
law
out
there
to
that
effect.
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
you
would
concede,
i
suppose,
that
for
supervisory
and
managerial
positions,
it
probably
isn't
possible
to
always
use
subjective
standards
in
hiring,
that
there
will
almost
always
be
a
subjective
component
in
hiring
and
promotional
decisions
for
that
kind
of
job.
justice
o'connor
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
must
go
without
saying
that
a
strict
validation
procedure
would,
indeed,
be
very
costly,
and,
so,
we
need
to
look
at
this
body
of
case
law
out
there
to
see
what
else
might--
justice
o'connor
mr.
mcgee,
did
the
trial
court
consider
the
statistical
evidence
in
the
disparate
treatment
claim?
justice
o'connor
and
held
that
it
didn't
raise
any
inference?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
mcgee,
it
seems
to
me
the
initial
proof
would
be
the
same
under
the
statistics,
under
either
theory.
justice
o'connor
the
initial
proof
by
the
plaintiff
and
apparently
there
was
enough
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
disparate
treatment
here.
justice
o'connor
and
i
assume
the
exact
same
proof
would
be
offered
and
considered
under
disparate
impact.
justice
o'connor
right.
so,
it
just
turns
on
what
the
defendant's
burden
is
after
that?
justice
o'connor
and
what
do
you
think
the
difference
is
in
the
defendant's
burden
under
the
two?
justice
o'connor
and
do
you
think
this
court
has
spoken
to
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
don't
think
it's
established
that
there
is
a
need
to
prove
validation,
is
there?
i
mean,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
out
the
bottom
line
of
what
the
defendant
has
to
show
in
these
cases
under
the
two
theories.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
second
case,
no.
86-6139,
watson
versus
fort
worth
bank
&
trust,
it
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it's
an
action
under
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
that
law
forbids
discrimination
and
employment
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex
or
national
origin.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
claimed
she
was
the
victim
of
racially
discriminatory
promotion
policies
carried
out
by
her
employer,
the
respondent
bank.
those
policies
essentially
allowed
individual
supervisors
at
the
bank,
all
of
whom
were
white,
to
use
their
unguided
discretion
to
choose
the
person
they
felt
was
best
suited
to
receive
promotions
when
vacancies
occurred.
our
prior
decisions
have
distinguished
two
theories
on
which
a
title
vii
plaintiff
may
proceed.
one
theory,
known
as
disparate
treatment
analysis
requires
proof
that
the
defendant
employer
intentionally
discriminated
against
the
plaintiff.
the
other
theory
which
is
called
disparate
impact
analysis
does
not
require
a
proof
of
discriminatory
intent.
instead,
the
plaintiff
may
show
that
facially
neutral
employment
criteria
which
are
not
sufficiently
job
related
have
a
substantial
adverse
effect
on
the
protected
group.
our
previous
disparate
impact
cases
have
dealt
with
objective
employment
criteria
such
as
high
school
diploma
requirements,
standardized
intelligence
test
and
minimum
height
and
weight
requirements.
the
courts
of
appeal
have
disagreed
with
one
another
as
to
whether
disparate
impact
analysis
may
be
applied
to
more
subjective
employment
criteria
such
as
those
used
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
the
court
below
applying
fifth
circuit
precedent
held
the
petitioner
should
not
be
allowed
to
use
disparate
impact
theory
to
challenge
her
employer
subjective
or
discretionary
promotion
criteria.
we
hold
today
that
disparate
impact
analysis
is
applicable
to
cases
like
this
one
without
regard
to
the
objective
or
subjective
nature
of
the
challenge
employment
practice.
the
court's
opinion
with
regard
to
the
evidentiary
standards
to
be
applied
is
joined
by
only
four
members
of
the
court.
but
the
judgment
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
are
consistent
with
our
holding.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
in
which
justices
brennan
and
marshall
have
joined.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
case.
