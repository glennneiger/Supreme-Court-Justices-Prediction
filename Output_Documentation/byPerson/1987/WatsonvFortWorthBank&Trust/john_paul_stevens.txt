justice

mr.
brender,
may
i
just...
i'm
not
entirely
clear
on
what
you
think
the
employer
has
to
show
in
a
case
in
which
the
practice
being
challenged
is
the
practice
of
using
subjective
discretionary
approach
by
the
supervisors
at
each
branch
office.
you
say
you
proved
statistically
that
this
has
resulted
in
discriminatory
impact.
how
can
the
employer
justify
that?
does
he
have
to
prove
that
he
must,
that
it's
necessary
for
him
to
use
discretionary--
justice
stevens
--by
that,
do
you
mean
you
validate
each
factor
that
the
local
manager
uses
or
validate
the
practice
of
using
multi-factor
discretion?
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
justice
stevens
the
people
who
were
familiar
with
the
employees
in
the
best
position
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
which
would
be
the
best
supervisor,
and
there's
really
no
way
to
prove
that
that's
a
necessary
way
to
hire
people,
is
it?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying
don't
do
it
on
a
subjective
basis,
that
you
must
have
a
series
of
objective
criteria
that
can
be
reviewed.
justice
stevens
and
if
you
find
they
made
a
few
mistakes,
why,
then,
you're
in
trouble.
justice
stevens
and
these
are
all
by
hypotheses
innocent
mistakes?
i
mean
there
is
no
racial
animus
motivating
any
of
this.
justice
stevens
well,
i
mean,
if
you
can
prove
racial
animus,
you
don't
need
any
of
this
theory.
justice
stevens
--may
i
ask
what...
we're
talking
about
individual
claims
here,
not
class
claims,
aren't
we?
justice
stevens
does
that
mean
that
every
individual...
say
we
accept
your
theory,
does
that
mean
that
every
individual
who
is
a
minority
person
who
sought
promotion
or
sought
a
higher
wage
during
the
period
in
issue
would
be
entitled
to
recover?
justice
stevens
how
do
you
screen
out
those
that
do
win
and
those
that
don't
win?
justice
stevens
well,
but
they're
all
injured
if
they
all
applied.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
each
one
would
be
equally
entitled
to
relief
under
your
theory
because
there's
an
absence
of
intent
or
any...
i
may
not
quite
get
the
understanding
here.
justice
stevens
why
not,
if
they're
a
member
of
the
group
to
which
the
statistics
apply?
of
course,
you
have
to
file
a
lawsuit,
i
realize
that,
but
i
would
think
all
lawsuits
would
become
fungible
by
members
of
the
class.
justice
stevens
right.
that's
easy
if
you've
got
a
class
action.
we
don't...
we
have
a
case
where,
by
hypothesis,
we
have
no
class
action
and
no
invidious
intent.
we
have
statistics
to
show
that
every
member
of
a
particular
class
was
not
promoted.
there
are
thirty
people
in
the
class
and
there
are
five
jobs.
they
would
all
prevail.
justice
stevens
how
do
you
decide
which
would
have
gotten
it?
i
don't
understand.
justice
stevens
i
thought
they
were
showing
that
the
permissible
factors
that
were
used
involving
discretion
had
the
unfortunate
consequence,
unintended,
of
ending
up
with
either
getting
many
more
males
than
you
should
have
or
many
more
females
than
you
should
have.
justice
stevens
and
whichever
way
it
goes,
it
seems
to
me
the
employer--
justice
stevens
--but
how
do
you
decide
which
ones
are
and
which
are
not?
justice
stevens
each
case
would
have
discretionary
decision.
justice
stevens
well,
very
frankly,
what's
running
through
my
mind,
i
hire
a
lot
of
law
clerks,
and
i
do
it
on
a
discretionary
basis,
and
i
suppose
statistically
i
either
discriminate
against
men
or
women,
just
to
take
a
simple
case,
and
say
all
the
male
applicants
who
applied
and
i
turned
down
come
in
and
say,
well,
statistically,
you've
got
a
disproportionate
number
of
women
clerks,
and
i
say
i
guess
i
have,
but
i
just
kind
of
pick
them
as
they
come.
which
law
clerks
will
prevail
and
which
won't?
i
don't--
justice
stevens
--and
there
are
a
lot
of
them
who
are
qualified
that
were
turned
down.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
go
on
further.
but
the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
this
raises
is
there's
no
racial
animus
in
the
objective...
say
you
require
a
high
school
diploma.
that's
not
job-related,
but
it
has
the
impact
of
denying
a
lot
of
minority
applicants
jobs.
well,
what
if
your
use
of
this
discretionary
factor
also
has
the
same
impact?
you
didn't
mean
it.
just
like
requiring
a
high
school
diploma.
you
didn't
mean
to
hurt
anybody,
but,
in
fact,
you
did.
if
this
system,
in
fact,
causes
precisely
the
same
harm,
why
should
you
not
have
to
have
precisely
the
same
defense?
justice
stevens
what
if
it
goes
on
for
ten
years
and
you
just
get
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
black
applicants
turned
down
and
you
never
hire
anybody
but
white;
would
you
say
the
same
thing?
justice
stevens
but
when
you
say
he
was
not
a
discriminator,
what
you
mean
is
he
did
not
intentionally
discriminate?
the
problem
the
case
really
raises
is
a
very
difficult
one.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
don't
think
they're
discriminators
but
who
maybe
really
are
without
knowing
it,
and
that's
what
the...
that's
the
troublesome
problem
this
case
raises.
