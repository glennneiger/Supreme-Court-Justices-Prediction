mr.
art
brender
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
that
this
case
presents
is
whether
or
not
clara
watson
can
test
her
employer's
subjective
employment
practices
by
disparate
impact
theory.
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
5th
circuit.
i'd
like
to
discuss
some
of
the
pertinent
facts
and
then
discuss
the
five
main
points
or
our
reasons
for
asking
the
court
to
reverse
this
case.
those
reasons
in
summary
are
that
the
griggs
v.
duke
power
that
announced
the
doctrine
of
disparate
impact
did
not
carve
out
an
exception
for
subjective
practices,
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
1972
amendments
to
title
vii
also
endorsed
both
disparate
impact
and
the
prior
case
law.
furthermore,
that
the
eeoc
guidelines
have
applied
disparate
impact
to
subjective
practices
since
at
least
1970,
that
there
is
no
bright
line
between
objective
and
subjective
practices
that
the
respondent
would
have
this
court
adopt,
and,
lastly,
that
the
adoption
of
this
exception
would
urge
employers
or
at
least
foster
employers
more
use
of
subjective
practices.
clara
watson,
after
having
nine
years
experience
as
a
cashier
at
a
montgomery
wards,
applied
in
1973
to
fort
worth
national
bank
as
a
teller.
she
applied
actually
several
times
before
she
was
hired.
when
she
was
hired,
she
was
hired
not
as
a
teller
but
as
a
proof
operator.
the
bank
had
at
that
time
four
black
employees,
none
of
them
in
positions
that
were
visible
to
the
public,
and
the
proof
operators
and
the
two
proof...
i
mean
printing
employees
were
in
the
basement
and
there
was
a
cafeteria
employee
and
a
porter.
after
three
years
on
the
job,
she
was
made
a
teller
at
the
bank
and
then,
after
seven
years
on
the
job,
in
1980,
she
first
applied
for
a
position,
for
a
supervisory
position
and
actually,
in
february
of
'80,
there
were
two
supervisory
positions
that
were
available;
one
as
the
supervisor
of
the
lobby
tellers
and
the
other
as
supervisory
of
the
motor
bank
tellers.
she
applied
for
each
and
in
each
case,
she
was
refused
the
job
and
a
white
male
in
one
instance,
white
female
in
another
instance,
was
selected.
one
year
later,
the
same
two
positions
became
available
and
she
sought
both
of
those
positions
again
with
the
same
result.
a
white
female
was
selected
for
the
lobby
supervisor
and
a
white
male
for
the
motor
bank
supervisor.
in
1984,
even
long
after
the
1981
refusal,
she...
there
were
still
no
black
directors,
officers
or
supervisors
at
the
fort
worth
bank
and
trust,
despite
the
fact
that
the
bank
is
within
a
few
miles
of
the
two
main
areas
of
concentration
of
the
black
population
in
fort
worth,
a
city
that
has
about
a
twenty-two
percent
black
population.
the
bank
system
of
both
hiring
and
assigning
persons
to
jobs
within
the
bank
was
one
that
relied
on
the
decisions
of
the
supervisors,
department
supervisors,
with
very
little
interference
from
the
upper
management.
those
supervisors
were,
of
course,
all
white.
the
compensation
system
that
the
bank
used
was
a
series
of...
they
used
evaluations
for
both
supervisory
personnel
and
for
line
personnel,
but
those
evaluations
were
filled
out
by
the
same
supervisors
and,
once
again,
all
were
reviewed
by
a
salary
review
committee.
the
salary
review
committee
rarely
changed
or
affected
the
decision
of
those
supervisors.
the...
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
this
limited
group
of
white
department
heads
made
virtually
all
the
hiring
and
promotion
decisions
as
well
as
evaluations
used
to
compute
compensation
and
that
the
upper
management
routinely
approved
those
decisions.
clara
watson,
at
trial,
based
on
a
stipulated
data
base,
presented
a
very
comprehensive
statistical
study
which
showed
that
in
the
area
of
hiring,
blacks
were
hired
at
a
rate
of
3.5
percent
while
whites
were
hired
at
a
rate
of
14.8
percent,
almost
four
times
greater,
and
that
figure
was
disputed
somewhat
by
the
bank,
who
claimed
that
they
only
hired
people...
we
used
all
the
applications
and
all
the
persons
who
were
hired,
they
disputed
that
and
said
we
only
hire
people
whose
applications
were
on
file
for
two
weeks.
so,
during
trial,
that
was
also
analyzed,
although
we
were
able
to
show
that
that
really
wasn't
true
because--
mr.
art
brender
--no,
but
the
same
supervisors
that
were
making
those
hiring
decisions
were
also
making
the
promotion
decisions.
mr.
art
brender
that's
correct,
although
the
hiring
case
actually
has
been
remanded
to
the
district
court
where
it's
still
pending.
mr.
art
brender
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
art
brender
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
we...
it
could
be
used
either
way,
and
i
think
this
court's
footnote
in
teamsters
says
that
the
matter
of
proof
may
be
applied
to
either
theory.
mr.
art
brender
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
art
brender
probably
both.
as
i
see
it,
to
apply
statistical
evidence
under
a
disparate
treatment
theory
or
pattern
of
practice
theory,
that
the
level
of
proof
is
greater.
this
court
has
said--
mr.
art
brender
--not
exactly.
i
may
be
interpreting
that.
mr.
art
brender
well,
i
think
there
is
in
this
sense,
because
at
least
under
castenada
v.
partida,
where
the
court
addressed
the
two
or
three
standard
deviation
argument
on
applying
an
intent
theory,
that
would
be
greater
that
under
griggs,
where
you
could
show
under
the
eighty
percent
rule,
the
three-fourths
rule,
you
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
have
statistical
significance.
in
other
words,
two
or
three
standard
deviations
is
either.05
or.01
statistical
significance,
but
the
eighty
percent
rule
wouldn't
have
to
come
to
that
level.
so,
i
think
there
would
be
a
difference
in
terms
of
statistics.
now,
in
fact,
our
statistics
were
basically
statistic
significant.
so,...
but
i
do
think
there
is
that
difference
statistically.
the
other
thing,
in
the
5th
circuit
held
this,
that
in
a
pattern
and
practice
case,
they
held
it
had
to
be
a
class
action
because
they
refuse...
the
majority
at
least
refuse
to
review
this
under
a
disparate
treatment
pattern
and
practice
theory.
there
certainly
are
some
cases,
and
i
believe
judge
goldberg
cites
those
in
his
dissent,
where
courts
have
held
the
statistics
are
not
sufficient
in
and
of
themselves
to
show
disparate
treatment.
mr.
art
brender
the--
mr.
art
brender
--i
believe
that's
what
they
did
because
they
just
simply
said
this
was
not
a...
we
had
disbanded
the
class
or
we
have
upheld
the
district
court's
feeling
to
that
extent,
and,
but
it
really
wasn't
analyzed
at
all
nor,
of
course,
would
they
allow
us
to
analyze
it
under
the
disparate
impact.
we
also--
mr.
art
brender
--well,
of
course,
we
attempted
in
the
district
court
to
prove
it.
we
were
pointing
in
that
direction,
but
i
don't
think
we
would
have...
i
don't
know
that
we
would
have
done
anything
different
with
the
statistical
evidence.
mr.
art
brender
oh,
okay.
i
think
the
disparate
impact
proof
is
there.
i
mean,
i
think
we
did
present--
mr.
art
brender
--maybe
i'm
not
understanding
your
question,
justice
white,
but
i--
mr.
art
brender
--oh,
well,
i
think
it
would
have
then
been
up
to
the
employer
to
come
forward
and
justify
on
business
necessity
their
practices,
which
they
didn't
do.
they
did
not
attempt
to
prove
business
necessity
or
validation
of
their
processes.
mr.
art
brender
no,
no.
you
wouldn't
have
to
prove
intent.
mr.
art
brender
that's
correct.
and
in
this
case,
they
did
not
present
a
statistical
case
or
a
statistical
expert.
mr.
art
brender
i
don't
believe
they
have
to
prove
intent.
i
think
that
a
disparate
impact
case
can
be
totally
devoid
of
intent.
mr.
art
brender
could
infer
intent.
mr.
art
brender
that's
correct.
mr.
art
brender
well,
i
think
proof
can
be
used
both
ways,
but
i
think
the
disparate
impact
probably
hones
in
more
on
the
group
discrimination,
whereas,
you
know,--
mr.
art
brender
--no.
the
only
disagreement
i
have
with
that
is
a
lot
of
the
language
in
the
disparate...
in
the
pattern
and
practice
cases
talks
about
a
pervasive
all
invasive
system
of
discrimination
and
so
forth
that's
intent,
and
i
interpret
that
to
mean
you've
got
to
basically
show
statistical
evidence
of
intent
at
every
stage
of
the
process;
whereas,
i
think
under
disparate
impact,
you
can
simply
show
that
the
overall
result
is
disproportionate
and
then
the
employer
must
come
in
and
justify
those.
mr.
art
brender
that's
correct.
mr.
art
brender
no,
no.
he
could
rebut
the
case
by
trying
to
show
that
there
is
no
impact.
in
other
words,
he
could
come
in
and
try
to--
mr.
art
brender
--that's
right.
either
by
validating
it
under
the
procedures
set
out
in
the
eeo
guidelines
or
by
simply
showing
that
it's
necessary
to
the
efficient
operation
of
the
business.
mr.
art
brender
that's
right.
mr.
art
brender
that's
griggs,
your
honor.
griggs
says
that
by
the
effect
of
the
impact,
he
must
then
come
in
and
justify
those
practices.
if
he's
unable
to
justify
those
practices,
then
he's
liable.
if
he
is,
then
he
can
continue
on
with
the
practice
and
he's
not
liable
despite
the
impact.
mr.
art
brender
justice
stevens,
i
think
he
can
do
it
several
ways.
i
think
that...
and
the
courts
have
addressed
those.
first,
he
can
validate
under
the
eeoc
guidelines
and,
of
course,
we
have
cited
and
talked
about
the
brief
of
the
apa
which
shows
that
contrary
to
what
is
being
argued
by
the
respondent,
subjective
procedures
are
validated.
there
are
legitimate
ways
in
which
you
can
validate
those
type
of
criteria.
the
other
way--
mr.
art
brender
--i
think
one
problem
with
the
facts
of
this
case
is
that
the
subjective...
i
don't
know
whether
it's
subjective
process
being
used,
but
there
was
really
no
criteria
that
was
out
there
for
which
the
supervisors
were
supposed
to
make
decisions.
but
i
think...
so,
that
system
that
they
were
using,
i
think,
is
kind
of
far
out
from
where
a
general
subjective
hiring
practice
decision
may
be
or
promotion
practice,
whatever,
but
i
think
that...
for
instance,
the
practice
that
they
had,
which
was
kind
of
a
gut-level
system,
i
want
to--
mr.
art
brender
--well,
i
think
there
is,
but
i
think
you
could
also
validate
it.
in
other
words,
you
could
simply
take...
for
instance,
one
way
you
could
validate
this
system
would
simply
be
to
take
upper
management
and
say
okay,
give
us
a
series
of
fact
situations
that
you
would
want
your
supervisor...
the
supervisors
would
handle,
from
routine
things,
like
a
social
security
check
doesn't
get
credited,
to
things
like,
for
instance,
attempted
forgery.
give
us
those
situations,
tell
us
how
a
successful
supervisor
would
deal
with
those
in
a
way
that
we
can
rate
those
things
in
terms
of
knowledge
of
the
job,
knowledge
of
the
bank
procedures,
knowledge
of
maybe
the
law
in
some
instances,
the
speed
with
which
they
resolve
them,
and
those
sorts
of
things.
and
then
what
you
do
is
you
simply
take
the
two
groups,
you
have
the
group--
mr.
art
brender
--only
to
validate,
only
to
validate.
in
other
words,
if
you
go
through
that
process,
you
take
and
you
test
the
people
who
are
the
successful
people,
the
supervisors,
and
then
you
test
those
who
are
the
applicants
but
did
not
succeed,
and
you
find
that
there
is
a
statistical
difference
on
the
side
of
those
who
are
selected.
in
other
words,
you
find
that
they
are...
they
were,
in
fact,
selected
properly,
then
you
could
continue
on
with
your
gut-level
system.
in
other
words,
that
only
applies--
mr.
art
brender
--if
you
made
some
mistakes,
you're
going
to
have
to
either
find
an
alternative
process
or
put
in
some
criteria
in
this
case
that
would--
mr.
art
brender
--there
wouldn't
have
to
be.
mr.
art
brender
well,
if
you
don't...
as
i
see
disparate
impact,
you
could
have
racial
animus.
that
doesn't
imply
intent
or
lack
of
intent.
mr.
art
brender
first
of
all,--
mr.
art
brender
--first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
think
the
thing
we've
got
to
realize
is
that
you
have
to
be
able
to
show
impact
first,
and
i
do
think
in
smaller
employers,
it's
going
to
be
difficult
to
show
an
impact
simply
because
of
the
number
of
decisions
would
not
be
sufficient
to
show
statistically
that
there's
an
impact.
but
assuming
that
you
could
do
it,
there
are
other
ways
to
validate.
that
would
not
be
the
only
way.
you
could--
mr.
art
brender
--i
think,
first
of
all,
there
are
the
transportability
provisions
to
the
guidelines.
those
are
things
that
say...
for
instance,
a
bank
teller's
job
is
not
that
much
different
than
a
bank
teller's
job
anywhere
else.
you
can
take
studies
that
have
already
been
done.
mr.
art
brender
only
if,
only
if
they
have
a
disparate
impact.
mr.
art
brender
well,
it
doesn't
depend
on
intent,
but
he
is
under
the
guidelines
required
to
be
looking
at
his
practices
and
aware
of
his
practices
under
the
provisions
of
self-help
provisions
of
the
guidelines,
where
an
employer
is
encouraged
to
try
to
eliminate
racial
bias
or
racial
effects
in
his
employment
practices.
mr.
art
brender
there
is,
and
we
have
cited
some
of
those
cases
in
our
reply
brief,
where
courts
have
simply
held
that
on
different
sorts
of
things,
one
of
them
that
comes
to
mind
is
the
zahorik
v.
cornell
university,
where
their
process
of
assessing
people
for
tenure
was
found
to
be...
to
satisfy
business
necessity.
mr.
art
brender
well,
i
think
there's--
mr.
art
brender
--i
think
that's
true.
i
think...
however,
i
do
think
that
you
can
narrow
subjective
things.
i
don't
think
there's
a
fine
line
between
subjective
and
objective.
for
instance,
by
their
definition,
a
test
would
be
objective,
but
an
essay
test
could
be
very,
very
subjective.
by
the
same
token,
things
like
personal
appearance,
which
were
on
the
rating
form
that
they
used
and
they
had
what
they
termed
was
a
professionally-developed
form
which
they
just
simply
didn't
use
for
promotions,
but
that
can
be
very,
very
objectively
determined.
if
the
criteria
are
set
out,
that's
what
this
case
addressed
in...
this
court
addressed
in
albemarle,
that
if
the
criteria
are
set
out
and
they
are
specific,
it
really
narrows
subjectivity
considerably,
and
i
think
attempts...
some
of
the
case
law
simply
attempts
to
try
to
get
at
narrower
and
more
objective
standards,
have
been
held
to
be
justified
by
business
necessity,
and
the
same
thing
with
regard
to
the
other
factor
that
the
respondent
raises
about
cost
studies.
there's
certainly
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
such
studies
would
be
costly.
there's
no
evidence
at
all.
they
didn't
attempt
to
produce
that.
likewise,
the--
mr.
art
brender
--well,
i
think
that
body
of
case
law
can
he
helpful.
however,
i
don't
think
that
the
estimates
of
costs
are
very
accurate.
there
are,
i
think,
four
cites,
none
of
which
are
specific
at
all.
in
one
of
them,
this
opm
study,
i
believe,
says
that
this
is
entirely
unreliable
data.
costs
would
not
have
to
be
great
if,
for
instance,
one
simply
hired
some
expert
to
simply
examine
the
procedure
and
validate
by
content
type
studies,
where
they
simply
decide
that
certain
things
in
the
interview
are
really
relevant,
they're
looked
at
and
those
relevant
factors
are
applicable
in
the
job
requirements,
and
then
design
the
application
or
the
interview
form
so
that
it
goes
to
those
behaviors,
and
that's
not
terribly
costly
to
do
one
of
those
type
studies.
once
again,
those
costs
only
have
to
be
incurred
after
there's
an
impact,
after
there's
an
adverse
impact
shown.
the
studies
that
we've
performed,
the
statistical
studies,
showed
that,
for
instance,
in
the
assignment
and
in
the
promotion,
blacks,
for
instance,
average
fourteen
months
in
a
particular
pay
grade
as
opposed
to
sixteen
months
for
whites,
that
blacks
averaged
about.18
pay
grades,
increase
in
pay
grade
per
year,
as
opposed
to.53
per
year,
and
in
order
to
test
for
things
like
education
and
tenure
on
the
job
and
experience
on
the
job,
we
did
a
study
that
included
those
of
multiple
regression,
and
that
showed
that
over
the
four-year
period
of
time,
blacks
were
1.22
to
1.38
pay
grades
behind
comparably-situated
whites.
mr.
art
brender
that's
correct.
mr.
art
brender
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
stevens.
mr.
art
brender
well,
what...
as
i
understand
it,
i
think
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
connecticut
v.
teale,
disparate
impact
is
simply
inference.
you're
taking
the
effect
on
the
group
and
from
that,
by
being
a
member
of
the
group,
you're
inferring
that
you
were
so
injured
and
that's
how
you
establish
liability.
mr.
art
brender
i
agree,
but
if
it's
not
a
class
action,
i
don't
believe,
unless
they
came
in
and
applied
within
the
180
days
and
fulfilled
the
other
agreements,
that
they
would
be
eligible
for
any
relief.
mr.
art
brender
i
think
that
if
they
were
in
the
case,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
the
statistical
proof
would
not
put
them
in
the
case.
mr.
art
brender
well,
if
there
was
a
class
action,
they
could
certainly
come
in
and
show
they
were
members
of
the
class.
mr.
art
brender
well,
i
don't
think
the
proof
necessarily
says
they
would
all
prevail
because
they
couldn't
all
get
the
one
job.
it
just
simply
says--
mr.
art
brender
--well,
all
you're
showing
is
that
the
decision-making
was
based
on
an
impermissible
racial
component.
that's
what
the
statistics
are
saying.
they're
not
saying
that
everyone--
mr.
art
brender
--that's
correct.
mr.
art
brender
that
wouldn't
mean
every
applicant
would
then
be
entitled
to
the
job.
mr.
art
brender
i
think--
mr.
art
brender
--that's
right,
but
i
think
that
applies
in
class
actions,
too.
i
mean,
the
court
then
has
to
decide
whether
a
person
was
actually
injured
or
not,
and
usually
they
do
that
sometimes
on
the
percentage
allocation
of
resources.
i
see
what
you
mean.
if
you
have
like
three
or
four
people
who
are
all
complaining
about
the
same--
mr.
art
brender
--well,
if
you
were
shown
to
have
a
disparate
impact
because
you
greatly
were
favoring
one
group
over
another
in
your
hiring
practices,
and
then
the
question
is
what
individual
out
of
that
group
would
then
prevail--
mr.
art
brender
--well,
the
only
one...
okay.
only
one
person
could
get
the
job,
let's
assume.
mr.
art
brender
if
that's
the
case,
then
the
court
is
simply...
it's
a
matter
of
damages,
as
i
see
it.
they're
not--
mr.
art
brender
--they
would
have--
mr.
art
brender
--i
think...
yeah.
i
think
they
would
have
the
cause
of
action.
i
don't
think
they
would
have
the
relief,
is
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
art
brender
by
that,
i
don't
mean
they
would
not
have
total
relief.
they
might
have...
let's
say
that
they
had
a
back
wage
award
which
would
be
determined
by
the
fact
that
only
one
of
them
would
have
gotten
the
job,
so
that
let's
just
say
that
they
were
disadvantaged
by
one
year's
worth
of
half
wages,
and
you
had
two
people
who
were
equally
disadvantaged
by
the
process,
then
they
would
have
to...
the
way
it's
commonly
done
in
class
actions
is
that
they
would
simply
split
that
back
wage
award.
mr.
art
brender
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
problem
under
intentional
discrimination,
too.
i
mean,
it
wouldn't
be
specific
to
impact
analysis,
it
would
be
the
same
thing
if
it
was
disparate
treatment
analysis
because
you
could
show
the
same
thing
statistically.
you
know,
it's
a
problem
of
relief
and
i've
dealt
with
it
in
class
actions,
not
on
individual
contexts,
and
that's
usually
the
way
it's
been
done
in
class
context,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
have
anything
to
do,
you
know,
relative
to
the
matter
of
proof
because
all
we're
talking
about
is
an
inference
of
discrimination,
liability,
in
other
words,
and
then
the
damage
situation
would
be
another
portion.
i
can
see
that
in
terms
of
the
injunctive
relief
might
be
difficult
if
you
have
one
position
and
two
people
who
have
filed
a
claim,
which
can
happen
outside
of
the
class
action,
and/or
there's
just
a
limited
number
of
applicants
that
have
been
determined
to
be
eligible
for
those
said
positions.
but,
once
again,
i
don't
think
that's
particular
to
this
particular
method
of
proof.
i'd
like
to
at
this
time
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
art
brender
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
white,
the
eeoc
position
has
changed
much
more
recently
because,
in
1986,
in
the
8th
circuit,
in
eeoc
v.
rath
packing
company,
the
eeoc
prosecuted
the
rath
packing
company
for
subjective
hiring
and
promotion
practices
under
the
disparate
impact
theory
and
prevailed.
the
court
so
found.
their
guidelines
for
eighteen
years
have
required
that
subjective
practices
be
treated
under
the
disparate
impact
theory
and
the
questions
and
answers
that
are
supposed
to
guide
employers
in
applying
the
guidelines
state
that,
too,
and
we
have
that
in
our
reply
brief.
there's
no
difference
between
the
provisions
that
the
respondent
cites
for
subjective
procedures
and
the
ones
for
objective
procedures.
just
like
in
the
case
studies
for
costs,
there
is
no
difference
between
objective...
the
cost
for
objective
and
subjective
validation.
they
just
don't
make
that
distinction.
mr.
art
brender
i
know.
he
kind
of
combined--
mr.
art
brender
--no.
well,
the
problem
is--
mr.
art
brender
--no.
they
provided
no
justification
whatsoever
for
their
practices.
i
mean,
they
just
said
we
have
them,
we
try
to
select
the
best
person.
of
course,
the
problem
is
the
best
person
was
always
white.
there
were
many
more
decisions,
by
the
way,
in
our
statistics.
we
took
into
account
every
increase
in
pay
grade.
so,
that
was--
mr.
art
brender
--no.
he
has
kind
of
a
hybrid
test
there
where
he
uses
disparate
impact
analysis
not
to
justify
the
particular
decision,
but
to
justify
the
particular...
they
don't
address
what
the
burden
of
proof
is
going
to
be
on
the
employer
in
doing
that,
and
i
don't
find
any
support
in
any
case
law
for
that
test.
it
wasn't
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
art
brender
thank
you,
your
honor.
