mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
much
of
petitioner's
account
of
this
case
today
is
irrelevant
and
perhaps,
to
some
extent,
even
inaccurate.
what
is
clear
and
what
is
important
for
this
court's
consideration
is
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
my
client
was
not
a
discriminator.
that
is
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals...
that
the
petitioner
did
not
prevail
in
its
disparate
treatment
claim
against
the
bank.
it's
also
clear
that--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--that
is
correct,
justice
white.
it
is
also
clear
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
this
was
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
as
well.
the
5th
circuit
did--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
it
did.
the--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--they
considered
it
both
in
whether
or
not
it
raised
the
prima
facie
case
under
mcdonnell
douglas
and
then
whether
or
not
it
had
been
used
to
show,
by
the
petitioner
to
show
that
the
articulated
reasons
by
the
bank
were
a
pretext
and
they
found
that
the
district
court
considered
those
fully
or
at
least
there
was
no
suggestion
that
it
did
not,
and
concluded
that
the
statistics
had
been
given
full
weight
by
the
trial
court.
the
difference
in
the
two
types
of
causes
of
action
or
methods
of
proof
that
the
petitioner
seeks
today
are
quite
clear
and
have
a
dramatic
effect
on
this
case.
on
the
one
hand,
the
case
was
tried
under
the
disparate
treatment
method,
which
is
the
mcdonnell
douglas,
furnco,
burdine
method
of
proof.
the
court,
applying
5th
circuit
precedent,
applied
those
tests
and
determined
that
the
petitioner
had
made
a
prima
facie
case
of
her
claim
of
racial
discrimination,
but
that
the
bank
had
articulated
a
reasonable
legitimate
excuse,
a
reason
for
its
actions--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--they
described
four
different
reasons
for
the
non-selection.
with
the
case
of
the
first
selection,
the
court
determined
that
the
bank
chose
mr.
burt
over
ms.
watson
because
of
considerations
of
his
experience,
his
previous
supervisory
experience,
his
close
working
relationship
with
mr.
shipp,
who
was
the
bank's
operation
officer
at
that
time.
also,
his
greater
or
better
qualifications
than
ms.
watson.
with
regard
to
the
second
decision,
that
being
the
one
where
ms.
cullar
was
chosen
as
the
motor
bank
supervisor,
the
same
types
of
considerations
were
made.
the
court
concluded
that
mr.
burt
had
a
greater
opinion
of
ms.
cullar's
qualifications
than
those
of
ms.
watson
and
that
those
reasons
were
not
pretext
for
discrimination.
likewise,
with
the
other
two
selections,
the
same
type
of
considerations
were
made
and
the
same
type
of
determinations
was
made.
the
qualifications
were
not
identical
in
each
case,
but
they
were
similar.
they
were
all
these
discretionary
intuitive-type
of
judgments
that
this
person
is
the
best
qualified
for
this
particular
job.
that
highlights
the
distinction
between
the
disparate
impact
test
which
would
require
no
proof
of
discriminatory
treatment,
no
proof
of
intent
or
motivation,
but
would
rather
require
only
that
the
petitioner
here
show
that
there
was
a
disproportionate
representation
of
blacks
in
the
bank's
work
force.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
the
initial
proof
would--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
i
know
of
nothing
that
could
be
offered
at
trial
that
would
be
any
different.
this
case
was
tried
over
four
days.
it
was--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--that
is
correct.
it
is
a
greater
burden
under
the
impact
theory
that's
thrust
upon
the
defendant
that
would
affect
this
case.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
well,
with
this
particular
case,--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--no,
i
do
not.
i
don't
believe
this
court
has
spoken
to
it.
however,
by
the
very
nature
of
the
impact
burden
of
proof
or
the
burden
that's
put
upon
the
defendant,
the
requirement
of
validation
of
his
selection
process,
there
is,
in
this
case,
a
virtually
insurmountable
burden
of
proof.
the
nature
of
subjective
criteria
are
such
that
despite
what
the
apa
says--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--as
i
read
griggs
and
those
that
follow,
there
is
a
requirement
that
the
petitioner
or
that
the
plaintiff
point
out
a
specific
facially-neutral
arbitrary-type
of
standard
or
requirement
that
causes
the
impacts
complained
of.
that's
not
been
done
here.
so,
under
my
theory
or
my
view
of
this
case,
the
petitioner
would
still
lose
because
she
has
never
made
her
prima
facie
case,
but
the
trial
court
could
and
very
well
likely
would
conclude
that
they
had
and
then
would
put
us
to
validating
our
entire
selection
process
without
ever
having
been
pointed
to
the
one
specific
point
in
that
selection
process
that
caused
the
impact.
i
don't
think
that
that
validation
can
be
done.
what
the
apa
talks
about
as
validation
are
really
objective-cation
of
a
subjective
system,
which
is
quite
a
long
ways
from
validating
the
bank's
selection
system.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
bank
was
absolutely
free
of
any
racial
discriminatory
intent
or
motivation.
it
selects...
it
uses
and
has
selected
a
process
which
it
believes
best
serves
its
needs,
its
legitimate
business
needs,
as
an
employer,
and
there
was--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
obviously,
errors
can
occur
and
we
would
submit
that
we
have
the
right
to
make
those
errors.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
that's
correct.
the
system
was
not
on
trial
at
the
district
court.
the--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--well,
the
difference
is,
justice
stevens,
that
with
the
facially-neutral
objective
requirements,
there
is
a
uniform
or
automatic
disqualification
of
certain
people.
it's
applied
across
the
board.
but
in
our...
my
client's
employment
system,
each
selection,
each
of
these
four
selections
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
were
done
on
an
individual
basis.
the
criteria
differed
to
some
extent
in
each
case.
there
was
no
automatic
disqualification.
the
impact,
if
you
will,
is
not
really
shown
because
of
the
system
itself,
but
rather
the
results
of
things
that
may
be
totally
unrelated
to
the
subjective
system
that
is
being
criticized.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
this
court
has
provided
an
adequate
method
for
challenging
that
type
of
result.
the
pattern
and
practice
tests
that
are
referred
to
in
mcdonnell
douglas
and
justice
powell's
opinion
make
clear
that
an
individual
can
show
that
the
employer's
procedure
or
practices
in
carrying
on
its
business
are
evidence
of
racial
intent
itself,
and
if
they
are
sufficiently
great
of
the
type
you
described,
i
feel
certain
that
the
plaintiff
would
be
able
to
obtain
a
finding
that,
in
fact,
any
reasons
offered
by
the
defendant
were,
in
fact,
a
pretext
for
his
racially-discriminatory
intention.
if
my
client
is
found
wrong
here
today,
even
though
he's
not...
he's
been
found
not
to
have
any
racial
intention
or
any
discriminatory
intention
or
motivation,
the
result
will
not
be
that
be...
that
it
switches
to
an
objective
system
for
making
its
promotional
decisions.
it
will,
instead,
not
go
to
objective
tests
because
we
don't
believe
that
any
tests
exist
today
which
will
give
my
client
the
type
of
decisions
they
choose
and
we
don't
believe
that
they
can
be
formulated
or
devised
in
any
time
in
the
foreseeable
future
at
a
cost
that
would
be
acceptable
to
my
client.
but
what
my
client
will
continue
to
do
is
to
make
the
subjective
decisions
that
it
has
in
the
past
because
it
believes
this
is
the
best
and
most
fair
way
to
satisfy
its
legitimate
business
need
to
supply
itself
with
employers
and
supervisors,
rather,
who
are
the
best
qualified.
but
what
it
will
be
forced
to
do
to
protect
itself
in
the
future
is
to
overlay
on
that
subjective
system
a
numerical
quota
system,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
what
the
congress
intended
when
it
enacted
title
vii.
the
subjective
system
that
is
challenged
sounds,
on
the
basis
of
the
briefs
on
the
petitioner's
side,
to
be
maybe
a
little
bit
sloppy
and
somewhat
inferior,
and
particularly
when
you
have
thrown
up
on
the
other
side
the
concept
of
objective
tests,
which
have
the
sound
of
being
scientific
and
fair,
but,
really,
the
decisions
that
are
being
made
at
my
client's
place
of
business
are
the
types
of
decisions
that
are
made
all
over
this
country
by
employers
of
all
sizes,
particularly
those
that
are
smaller,
like
my
client,
but
all
employers.
the...
no
one
would
suggest,
i
don't
believe,
that
the
employer
would
prefer
to
continue
to
have
the
right
to
make
his
judgments
on
promotion
based
upon
his
view
of
what
is
most
important
to
him,
who
best
typifies
those
criteria
and
those
traits
which
he
thinks
are
most
important
to
his
business
decisions.
the
experience
that
the
employer
has
with
dealing
with
these
people
who
are
applicants
for
promotion
puts
him
in
the
best
position
to
determine
who
has
the
characteristics,
such
as
leadership
or
ability
to
relate
to
other
people
or
the
respect
of
the
co-workers,
the
honesty,
integrity,
those
types
of
subjective
discretionary
criteria
that
were
employed
here.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
i
think
because
while
validation
of
objective
testing
devices
may
be
hard,
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
it
can
be
done.
there
has
absolutely
been
no
demonstration
even
though
many
years
of
efforts
and
studies
have
been
done,
there's
been
no
indication
that
subjective
criteria
can
be
validated.
i
believe
that
the
result
will
be
that
a
subjective
system,
if
challenged
under
the
theory
proposed
by
the
petitioner,
will
result
in
an
automatic
finding
of
liability
if
there's
an
imbalance.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
well,
i
am
not
familiar
with
what
other
employers
do
and
whether
that
is
how
they
respond
to
the
question,
but
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
that's
what
i
would
have
to
recommend
to
my
client.
the
numerical
quota
system
is
the
only
appropriate
response
to
a
finding
of
the
type
petitioner
seeks.
my
problem
with
that,
justice
scalia,
is
that
that
is
not
the
intention
of
congress,
at
least
not
the
way
i
read
title
vii
and
the
history
of
title
vii.
it's
just
the
contrary.
it
places
the
decision
of
who
is
promoted,
instead
of
being
free
of
racial
consideration,
race
becomes
the
paramount
consideration.
to
me,
that's
just
an
absolute
abomination
of
the
purpose
of
title
vii.
the
cases
of
this
court
have
uniformly,
i
believe,
recognized
a
distinction
between
the
objective
types
of
criteria
as
opposed
to
the
subjective
criteria
that
we're
considering
here
today.
the
griggs
case,
of
course,
dealt
with
the
objective
test
of
the
high
school
education
requirement,
and
also
the
standardized
testing.
that
type
of
objective
standard
was
easily
identifiable.
the
causation
could
be
pointed
to
and
the
impact
shown.
those
type
of
objective
standards
have
been
found
in
other
cases,
such
as
dothard,
involving
the
minimum
height
and
weight
requirement,
the
new
york
transit
authority
case,
which
dealt
with
the
exclusionary
rule
that
disqualified
persons
who
had
a
history
of
drug
use,
teale
that
dealt
with
a
written
test,
and
albemarle
that
dealt
with
written
tests.
but
opposed
to
those
type
of
cases
are
the
mcdonnell
douglas,
the
furnco,
the
aikens
and
the
burdine
cases,
which
recognize
a
different
set
of
proof
and
a
different
set
of
facts.
the
situation
in
mcdonnell
douglas
was
an
individual
who
complained
that
he
was
not
hired
because
of
his
participation...
was
not
hired
because
of
his
race.
the
reason
articulated
by
the
employer
was
that
he
was
not
hired
or
not
rehired
because
of
his
participation
in
illegal
activities.
the
court
held
and
pointed
out
the
distinction
between
that
type
of
an
articulated
reason
that
is
subjective
and
inherently
unique
to
the
employer
as
opposed
to
those
which
were
present
in
griggs
which
had
the
effect
of
disqualifying
large
groups
of
people
automatically,
and
i
think
that's
the
key
to
the
distinction
between
mcdonnell
douglas
and
griggs,
is
that,
on
the
one
hand,
you
have
these
objective
artificial
rules
which
disqualify
large
groups
of
people,
regardless
of
consideration
of
their
individual
qualifications,
where,
with
mcdonnell
douglas,
you
have
a
consideration
of
qualifications.
here,
in
my
case,
the
bank
recognized
that
clara
watson
was
fully
qualified
for
the
job
she
sought
or
at
least
possessed
the
minimum
qualifications
as
well
as
did
others.
some
of
the
selections
that
were
involved
here
today,
there
were
four
or
five
other
people
considered,
including
in
that
group
was
at
least
one
other
black
person.
the
bank
considered
the
qualifications
of
each
of
those
people
on
an
individual
basis
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
person
selected
was
the
best
qualified
and,
therefore,
the
others
were
less
qualified.
but
that's
the
type
of
selection
process
that
was
referred
to
in
the
johnson
v.
transportation
authority
opinion
from
last
term.
the
purpose
of
title
vii
impact
cases
is
to
remove
these
arbitrary
barriers
which
prevent
large
groups
of
minorities
and
women
from
being
qualified.
but
once
they've
been
qualified,
then
the
decisions
as
to
whether
they
were
chosen
or
not
chosen
should
be
considered
under
disparate
treatment
theory.
if
there
is
a
pattern
and
practice
of
racial
discrimination
or
discrimination
on
other
prohibited
bases,
then
that
will
come
out
as
a
part
of
the
disparate
treatment
proof,
and
if
it
is
proved
by
the
statistical
evidence,
it
can
be
dealt
with
and
can
be
the
basis
for
finding
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
discriminatory
intent.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
the
eeoc
views
the
case
exactly
the
same
way
i
do.
they
have
filed
a
brief
before
this
court
which
supports--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--no,
justice
white.
i
think
their
view
is
best
described
as
having
been
inconsistent.
they
have
had
varying
views
over
the
history
of
title
vii.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
let
me
see
if
i
can
go
back
in
time.
i
believe--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--in
1978,
when
the
uniform
guidelines
were
adopted,
they
had
the
view
that
subjective
selection
processes,
such
as
present
here,
might
not
be
verifiable
or
validateable
and,
therefore,
need
only
be
validated
under
the
federal
law,
which
comments
to
the
uniform
guidelines
suggest
would
be
under
the
disparate
treatment
theory
as
announced
in
mcdonnell
douglas.
prior
to
that,
there
was
the
1970
guidelines,
had
some
rather
harsh
validation
requirements
on
all
forms
of
selection
processes.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
objective
and
subjective.
yes,
sir.
and
the
'78
guidelines
were
seen
as
a
response
to
the
complaints
of
the
apa
and
other
professionals
that
they
were
basically
unachievable
goals
and
objectives
and
put
the
defendant,
the
employer,
in
the
position
of
basically
being
out
of
compliance
automatically,
and
that
is
the
reason
for
the
'78
guidelines
and
why
the
eeoc
supports
our
position
here
today.
the...
one
other
thing
that
i'd
like
to
point
out
in
response
to
a
question
to
mr.
brender,
the
numbers
in
this
case
do
not
make
disparate
impact
an
appropriate
method
of
proof.
there
are
only
two
black
employees
who
sought
promotions,
clara
watson
and
one
other
employee.
those
numbers
are
entirely
too
small
to
make
any
kind
of
determination
of
statistical
impact
or
statistical
significance,
and--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--how
many
employees
are
involved
in
the
whole
bank?
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
there
are
approximately
eighty
employees.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
approximately
nine
or
ten.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
there
are
no
employees
that
i'm
aware
of
in
those
positions
any
longer,
justice
marshall.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
the
bank
does
not
have
a
cafeteria
at
this
time
nor
did
it
have
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
they
did
have
a--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--there
is
one
employee,
i
believe,
that
has
the
position
that
you're
referring
to,
it's
not
a...
they
do
not
have
a
cafeteria,
but
there's
someone
in
a
position
that's
similar
to
what
you
have
described.
the
other
positions
are
all
employees
of
the
bank
in
either
operations
or
in
the
teller's--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--there
are
approximately
four.
fifty
percent
of
those
people
are
on
the
floor
of
the
bank.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
yes.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
out
of
eight.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
that's
correct.
how
many
negroes
are
on
the--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--yes.
half
of
those
people
are
operating
in
positions
similar
to
the
one
ms.
watson's
in.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
some
are
tellers,
some
are
customer
service
personnel,
but
they
all
function
in
the
same
area
of
the
bank.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
i
don't
think
that's
what
we
have
here.
i
think
all
of
the
positions,
including
the
position
that
you
referred
to,
are
all
legitimate
important
positions
to
the
bank,
including,
at
the
time
of
trial,
one
black
employee
who
was
serving
as
an
assistant
supervisor
in
the
motor
bank
facility.
this
is
the
same
employee
who
had
sought
some
of
the
earlier
promotions
that
ms.
watson
sought.
the
subjective
selections
that
my
client
uses
are
not
inherently
bad.
they
have
just
been
thrust
in
this
position
by
the
petitioner.
they
are
no
different
than
the
type
of
selection
process
that
justice
stevens
referred
to
with
his
law
clerks.
if,
for
instance,
justice
stevens
determined
that
he
chose
to
retain
one
of
his
law
clerks
for
a
second
term,
and
he
wanted
to
choose
among
the
law
clerks
he
had
which
one
that
he
would
retain
for
that
second
term,
he's
going
to
necessarily
rely
upon
his
intuitive
subjective
judgment
as
to
which
one
is
the
best
qualified,
will
most
fulfill
his
needs
as
a
law
clerk,
and
i
think
it's
just
ludicrous
to
suggest
that
justice
stevens
should
have
to
hire
an
industrial
psychologist
to
devise
some
form
of
test
so
that
his
decisions
can
be
validated
so
as
he
can
avoid
a
claim
of
discriminatory
impact.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
that's
important.
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
mcdonnell
douglas
makes
clear
and
burdine
makes
clear
that
the
law
does
not
require
that
the
employer
have
the
best
or
the
most
balanced
work
force.
it's
only
that
he
make
those
decisions
free
of
discriminatory
intent
and
animus,
and
that
is
what
the
trial
court
found
and
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
affirmed.
they
found
that
my
client
was
not
a
discriminator,
and
we
suggest
that
the
opinion
of
the--
mr.
bruce
w.
mcgee
--well,
i
agree
that
that
is
the
problem
with
this
case,
but
this
case
differs
from
those,
such
as
griggs,
where
you're
dealing
with
non-intent.
by
definition,
these
judgments
and
selections
that
my
client
made
were
intentional
decisions.
they
made
a
judgment
to
choose
this
person
or
to
not
choose
that
person.
those
are
intent-based
decisions
by
definition
and
should
be
properly
analyzed
under
disparate
treatment
tests.
we
would
urge
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
