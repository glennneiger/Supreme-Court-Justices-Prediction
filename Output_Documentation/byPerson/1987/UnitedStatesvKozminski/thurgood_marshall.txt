any
kind
of
services?
justice

like
shoveling
manure.
justice
marshall
like
shoveling
manure.
justice
marshall
how
could
it
be
servitude
when
you
pay
for
it?
you
pay
the
dues
to
sweep
those
floors.
that
is
not
servitude.
justice
marshall
you
pay
the
dues
when
you
apply
to
a
fraternity.
mr.
reynolds,
i
am
hung
up
on
the
involuntary
part,
not
the
servitude
part.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as,
if
you
take
it
literally,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
involuntary
servitude.
there
is
such
a
thing
as
involuntary
imprisonment,
or
involuntary...
but
you
don't
work
for
somebody
unless
you
want
to
work
for
them.
so
really
it
is
just
a
matter
of
what
the
alternative
is.
you
want
to
work
for
them
if
the
alternative
is,
he
is
going
to
kill
you,
or
if
the
alternative
is,
he
is
going
to
beat
you.
now,
what
other
alternatives...
i
mean,
involuntary
doesn't
mean
literally
involuntary.
it
means,
right,
that
the
alternative
is
unattractive.
justice
marshall
mr.
reynolds,
shouldn't
we
leave
a
lot
to
the
wisdom
of
the
prosecutor?
i
can't
imagine
a
prosecutor,
a
u.s.
attorney
prosecuting
a
father
for
making
his
son
work.
justice
marshall
they
just
wouldn't
bring
a
case
like
that,
would
they?
justice
marshall
but
in
this
case
aren't
we
dealing
with
a
jury
verdict,
not
what
the
prosecutor
did?
justice
marshall
are
we?
is
that
true?
justice
marshall
but
that
is
not
what
you
are
complaining
about?
justice
marshall
you
are
complaining
about
the
judgment.
justice
marshall
and
what
a
jury
decided.
justice
marshall
didn't
you
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment--
justice
marshall
--didn't
you
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment?
justice
marshall
well,
was
it
filed?
it
could
have
been
filed,
and
you
could
have...
all
of
this
could
have
been
washed
out.
justice
marshall
[inaudible]
justice
marshall
a
mentality
of
seven
to
ten
years
old.
justice
marshall
you
have
got
to
do
better
than
that.
justice
marshall
did
you
put
in--
justice
marshall
--did
you
put
in--
justice
marshall
--did
you
put
in
any
testimony
contrary
to
that?
justice
marshall
was
he
the
same
type
as
the
other
one?
justice
marshall
was
he
the
same
qualification?
justice
marshall
so
you
think
you
have
one,
and
i
have
one.
right?
justice
marshall
is
that
your
position?
justice
marshall
is
that
your
position?
justice
marshall
is
that
your
position,
that
you
had
one
on
one
side
and
one
on
the
other
side?
justice
marshall
that
is
your
fact,
and
the
jury
decided
which
one
was
to
be
followed.
is
that
correct?
justice
marshall
is
that...
you
admit
that?
justice
marshall
well,
what
are
we
arguing
about?
well,
you
don't
necessarily
need
to
infer
that
they
believed
that
they
had
the
mental
ability
of
a
seven
or
eight-year-old.
justice
marshall
well,
what
do
you
have
juries
for?
justice
marshall
you
asked
for
a
jury,
didn't
you?
justice
marshall
was
there
anything
in
any
of
the
instructions
that
said
what
you
said?
justice
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
marshall
well,
how
does
it
apply
here?
justice
marshall
how
does
it
apply
here?
justice
marshall
i
mean,
while
you
are
at
it,
if
you
are
going
to--
justice
marshall
--any
wage.
justice
marshall
any
wage.
they
didn't
pay
any.
justice
marshall
i
mean
as
of
now
they
weren't
paying
them
any
when
this
case
was
brought.
they
weren't
paying
them
any.
justice
marshall
when
did
you
ever
consider
food
to
be
payment?
justice
marshall
when.
payment
means
money,
m-o-n-e-y.
green.

[generallaughter.]
and
the
only
green
they
had
was
mouldy
bread.
