justice
scalia
well,
why
not
limit
it
to
death
or
beating
or
some
physical
harm?
once
you
leave
that,
i
don't
know
what
you
are
left
with.
you
will
deprive
yourself
of
the
love
of
your
father
if
you
don't
do
what
he
says,
or
of
the
love
of
a
spiritual
leader?
once
you
leave
physical
harm,
what
do
you--
justice
scalia
--what
do
you
mean,
so
intolerable?
surely
that
depends
on
the
individual.
if
i
am
an
adherent
of
a
particular
religious
cult,
depriving
me
of
the
love
of
the
leader
of
that
cult
is
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
that
could
happen
to
me.
i
mean,
that
is
intolerable
to
me.
justice
scalia
so
that
could
qualify
then.
that
could
qualify.
justice
scalia
what
about
depriving
me
of
my
father's
love?
i
am
no
longer
a
minor.
i
am
an
adult.
but
i
truly
love
my
father,
and
he
says,
you
know,
son,
i
want
you
to
work
in
my
business,
and
i
say,
dad,
this
is
really
not
what
i
like
to
do,
but
for
you,
for
you
i
will
do
it,
and
it
is
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
to
me.
justice
scalia
i
think
you
are
going
to
destroy
a
lot
of
family
businesses
in
this
country.
justice
scalia
what
differs
in
all
of
those
cast,
though,
is
what
i
suggested
earlier.
it
is
really
true
that
you
can
kidnap
someone
against
their
will,
and
all
you
have
to
show
is
that
you
intended
to
kidnap.
you
really
cannot
get
somebody
to
work
in
the
literal
sense
against
his
will.
he
wills
to
work.
i
mean,
only
because
the
choice
you
have
given
him
is
even
worse
than
working,
so
you
really
can't
compare
what
you
do
under
these
other
criminal
statutes.
justice
scalia
well,
that
is
right,
but--
justice
scalia
--all
it
proves
is
that
the
test
can't
be
whether
the
person
really
wills
it
or
not,
that
your
focus
on
the
voluntariness
is
a
focus
on
something
which
never
exists.
in
all
cases
it
is
voluntary
in
some
sense,
so
it
seems
to
me
what
you
have
to
look
to
is
the
choice
that
is
given.
that
is
the
only
thing
that
distinguishes
one
case
from
the
other.
what
is
the
choice
that
forces
you
to
accept
this
one
rather
than
the
other
one,
voluntarily?
justice
scalia
what
about
the
person
who
is
absolutely
convinced
that
all
he
has
to
do
is
quit
his
job
and
he
will
starve
to
death,
that
he
can
never
get
another
job,
and
he
sticks
around
because
the
person
wants
to
keep
him
and
will
pay
him?
justice
scalia
that
is
not
legal,
and
it
is
not
force.
justice
scalia
i
thought
you
said
you
did
know.
now
you
are
talking
like
the
solicitor
general.
laughter.
it
is
the
solicitor
general
who
talks
about
these
inevitable
gray
areas
and
what
not.
i
thought
you
were
going
to
give
us
a
nice,
clear
line.
now
you
are
telling
us
that
you
are
just
as
bad
as
they
are.
we
are
looking
to
you
for
salvation
and
there
is
none,
you
tell
us.
justice
scalia
mr.
ziemba,
you
really
think
you
couldn't
get
that
evidence
in
on
saying,
you
know,
your
honor,
i
want
to
introduce
it,
because
nobody
who
has
not
been
threatened
with
physical
coercion
would
be
likely
to
endure
these
conditions.
it
tends
to
prove
that
the
person
was
threatened
with
some
physical
harm
or
with
some
physical
coercion.
now,
it
doesn't
necessarily
establish
that,
but
it
certainly
tends
to
prove
it.
wouldn't
you
be
able
to
get
it
in
on
that
theory?
