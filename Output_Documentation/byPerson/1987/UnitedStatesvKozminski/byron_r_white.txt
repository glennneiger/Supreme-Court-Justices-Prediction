mr.
reynolds,
do
you
agree
with
the
instruction
that
the
district
court
gave?
justice
white
so
you
don't
think
a
new
trial
was
necessary,
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
affirmed.
justice
white
well,
i
thought
they
ordered
a
new
trial
because
the
district
court's
definition
was
too
broad.
justice
white
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
affirmed
the
conviction?
justice
white
and
hence
the
instruction
is
perfectly...
was
a
proper
one.
justice
white
i
suppose
in
terms
of
voluntariness,
the
worse
the
conditions
are,
the
more
likely
it
is
that
somebody
would
want
to
leave.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
it
adds
to
the
pressure
not
to
feed
people
well.
i
would
think
they
would
want
to
get
out.
justice
white
if
you
threaten
someone
with
invoking
the
law
to
institutionalize
them,
that
is
certainly
legal
force,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
the
defendant
says,
i
want
you
to
do
this
job,
and
i
will
pay
you
a
certain
amount
of
money,
and
i
want
to
keep
you
here,
and
i
am
sure
that
if
you
quit
you
will
never
get
another
job.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
picked
you
out
of
the
unemployment
line
on
purpose.
justice
white
so
in
my
example,
yes,
it
might
be...
you
might
be
able
to
make
a
prima
facie
case.
justice
white
he
goes
to
the
unemployment
office
and
finds
a...
somebody
who
looks
suitable,
and
brings
him
out
to
his
farm,
and
has
him
work,
and
pays
him,
and
has
him
work
hard,
and
the
fellow...
and
he
feeds
him
well
and
all
that,
but
the
reason
they
stay,
they
can't
stand
farm
work,
but
the
reason
they
stay
is
that
they
are
just
sure
they
would
be
destitute.
and
the
employer
agrees
with
them,
you
would
be
destitute
if
you
left
here,
so
stick
around.
that
makes
out
a
case
under
your
theory,
i
guess.
justice
white
well,
anybody
would
rather
eat
than
starve,
i
suppose.
isn't
that
the
whole
point,
that
what
anybody
would
do
what
the
jury
would
do,
and
the
jury
in
this
case
convicted?
and
in
a
case
like
all
of
these
horribles
that
are
being
presented,
no
reasonable
minded
jury
would
convict.
isn't
that
the
solution?
justice
white
but
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
new
trial,
the
solicitor
general
is
interested
in
having
the
right
instructions
to
the
jury.
justice
white
well,
that's
quite
a
bit.
there
is
no
use
going
through
a--
justice
white
--there
is
no
use
going
through
a
trial
for
nothing
and
then
having
to
go
through
it
again.

trailer.

or
both.
justice

or
little
cats,
maybe.

justice
white
what
about
the
threat
to
institutionalize
them?
is
that
true?
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
white
well,
mr.
ziemba,
what
about
the
employer
who
keeps...
who
hires
a
person
that
he
knows
is
on
the
run?
he
is
wanted
for...
in
another
state
for
a
crime,
and
he
tells
him,
either
stay
and
work
for
me
at
this
wage
or
i
am
going
to
turn
you
in.
justice
white
what
is
that?
justice
white
yes,
but
what
about...
does
your
definition
that
you
are
plugging
for
cover
that?
justice
white
that
is
legal
coercion.
justice
white
you
threaten
to
get
him
enmeshed
in
the...
of
the
state.
justice
white
so
the
threat
of
putting
them
in
a
mental
institution
is
the
same
sort
of
thing.
justice
white
that
is
force.
what
about
the
threat
to
turn
the
employee's
brother
in?
he
says,
i
know
your
brother,
he
is
working
on
the
next
farm.
he
is
wanted
in
the
next
state.
justice
white
now,
you
either
stay
here
or
i
am
going
to
turn
him
in.
