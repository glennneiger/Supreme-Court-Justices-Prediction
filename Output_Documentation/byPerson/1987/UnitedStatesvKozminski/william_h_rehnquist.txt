chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
now
in
number
86-2000,
united
states
versus
ike
kozminski.
mr.
reynolds,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
reynolds,
let's
get
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
meaning
of
servitude
for
a
moment.
take
a
fraternity
hazing,
where
people
may
be
involuntarily
performing
services
for
a
period
of
24
hours.
is
that
the
sort
of...
entirely
apart
from
the
involuntary
aspect,
is
that
servitude
for
purposes
of
this
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
you
are--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--yes,
but
that
would
be
involuntary.
supposing
they
are
told
just
to
scrub
the
floors
and
scrub
them
and
scrub
them
and
scrub
them
for
24
hours.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
jury
always
is
going
to
have
some
sort
of
evidence
from
which
they
can
deduce
intent.
there
are
no
eye
witnesses
to
intent.
and
that
is
pretty
much
a
jury
call.
it
strikes
me
that
your
definition
of
this
is
very,
very
amphorphous
for
a
criminal
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
definition
of
both
servitude
and
involuntary,
particularly
if
there
is
no
reasonable
man
standard
for
justice
scalia's
hypothesis
when
the
father
wants
the
son
to
keep
working.
if
in
fact
the
son
is
very...
has
a
will
that
is
very
easily
overpowered,
then
that
is
enough,
i
take
it,
even
though
a
reasonable
person
would
not
be
overpowered
by
similar
inducements
from
a
father.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
with
kidnapping
and
other
crimes
you
have
objective
factors
that
have
to
be
present
as
well
as
the
intent,
and
here
there
seems
to
be
quite
a
dearth
of
objective
factors.
you
know,
you
have
to
hold
someone
against
their
will.
now,
holding
someone
is
fairly
easy
to
define.
but--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--yes,
but
what
you
are
talking
about
in
a
typical
kidnapping
statute
is
a
physical
restraint,
and
here
obviously
your
definition
embraces
something
a
good
deal
more
than
a
physical
restraint.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
reynolds.
mr.
ziemba,
we
will
hear
next
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
the
threat
to
sue
him
for
a
debt
be
that
sort
of
coercion,
or
does
legal
coercion
have
to
include
the
possibility
of
imprisonment
or
confinement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ziemba.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
reynolds,
you
have
used
your
time.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
