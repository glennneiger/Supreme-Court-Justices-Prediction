justice
o'connor
mr.
reynolds,
do
you
think
the
government
could
win
at
trial
without
a
broad
definition
of
this
statute
and
without
the
use
of
psychological
testimony?
it
sounded
to
me
when
i
read
the
description
in
the
briefs
of
the
case
that
with
evidence
of
physical
beatings
and
threats
of
commitment
that
the
government
didn't
need
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
statute
here,
in
this
case.
justice
o'connor
well,
one
thing
that
is
a
concern,
of
course,
is
that
these
are
criminal
statutes.
justice
o'connor
and
presumably
we
have
a
rule
of
lenity,
and
the
concern
that
one
has
in
interpreting
it
broadly
is,
what
do
you
do
about
services
performed
by
someone
because
of
the
attraction
of
a
loved
one
or
the
charisma
of
a
spiritual
or
a
political
leader,
or
for
example
an
adult
child
who
may
work
for
years
taking
care
of
an
invalid
parent
out
of
fear
that
they
will
be
cut
off
without
an
inheritance
if
they
don't?
i
mean,
how
do
you
take
care
of
all
those
things?
are
all
these
criminal
offenses?
justice
o'connor
do
we
know
what
servitude
is?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
against
the
will
component
would
seem
to
me
to
go
to
what
is
involuntary.
i
just
wondered
what
servitude
was.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
used
to
have
to
do
that
as
a
youngster.
now,
i
suppose
i
was
in
servitude?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
about
the
adult
child
who
doesn't
want
to
have
to
take
care
of
an
invalid
parent
but
feels
compelled
to
do
so?
justice
o'connor
but
you
would
acknowledge
there
could
be
facts
that
would
fit
within
it
if
the
parent
indeed
was
exerting
some
kind
of
psychological
pressure
on
the
offspring
to
make
them
do
it.
justice
o'connor
or
threatened
state-imposed
legal
coercion,
i
thought--
justice
o'connor
--which
may
have
been
present
here.
justice
o'connor
with
mental
institutions.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
didn't
say
that.
justice
o'connor
it
didn't
say
that.
