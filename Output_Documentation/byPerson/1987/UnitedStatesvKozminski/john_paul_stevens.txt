justice

mr.
reynolds,
can
i
interrupt
you
and
go
back
a
minute
to
your
discussion
of
servitude?
would
you
think
that
the
statutory
definition
would
have
been
met
in
this
case
if
these
people
had
been
paid
the
minimum
wage
and
overtime
for
their
extra
hours
and
had
lived
in
a
clean
trailer?
equally
involuntary.
all
your
evidence
of
voluntariness
is
the
same.
justice
stevens
you
think
it
would
still
be
servitude
if
the
terms
of
employment
were
perfectly
normal
and
legitimate.
here
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
for
calling
it
servitude
is
much
stronger
when
you
have
the
kind
of
facts
you
have
here.
justice
stevens
although
i
am
not
sure
they
have
anything
to
do
with
voluntariness.
justice
stevens
mr.
ziemba,
that--
justice
stevens
--well,
what
about
your
opponent's,
mr.
reynolds'
suggestion
of
a
hypnotized
person?
that
would
not
cover
that.
and
wouldn't
that
be
about
as
plain
a
case
as
you
could
get
of
an
involuntary
relationship?
justice
stevens
well,
you
may
or
may
not
be
right.
but
at
least
you
would
agree
that
the
hypnotic
case
would
not
be
covered.
you
just
say,
that
is
not
important
because
it
never
happens.
but
it
would
not
be
covered
under
the
definition
of--
justice
stevens
--okay.
what
about
these
people?
do
you
think
these
particular
victims
made
a
voluntary
choice
to
live
under
these
conditions?
justice
stevens
mr.
ziemba,
if
you
take
the
sixth
circuit's
definition
instead,
the
rather
strictly
defined
definition,
would
it
not
be
true
that
all
the
evidence
about
the
conditions
under
which
these
men
lived
would
be
totally
irrelevant
and
probably
inadmissible?
justice
stevens
what
would
it
tend
to
prove?
most
of
it,
the
stuff,
how
they
lived
and
worked
from
3:00
in
the
morning
and
so
forth,
that
doesn't
show
physical
force--
justice
stevens
--it
doesn't
show
threatened
legal
coercion.
justice
stevens
so
what
you
are
really
arguing
is
that
all
that
evidence
which
somehow,
i
must
confess,
seems
relevant
to
the
ultimate
question,
is
irrelevant
under
your
definition
of--
justice
stevens
--involuntary
servitude.
