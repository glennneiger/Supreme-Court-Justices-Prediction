mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
looks
to
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
its
implementing
legislation,
principally
section
1584,
title
xviii
of
the
u.s.
code,
which
makes
it
a
crime
for
any
person
to
knowingly
and
wilfully
hold
another
to
involuntary
servitude.
at
issue
are
the
sorts
of
conduct
the
term
"involuntary
servitude"
can
properly
reach.
is
it
limited
solely
to
the
use
of
physical
or
legal
force
or
the
threat
thereof,
as
the
second
circuit
has
held,
or,
as
the
court
below
concluded,
may
a
defendant
also
be
criminally
liable
if
he
uses
fraud
and
deceipt
to
hold
another
against
his
or
her
will,
at
least
as
to
certain
classes
of
individuals,
minors,
immigrants,
or
mentally
incompetent,
or
as
we
maintain
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
held,
may
other
forms
of
coercion
also
lead
to
criminal
culpability
if
such
behavior
was
intended
to
compel
another
to
work
against
his
or
her
will
and
did
in
fact
have
that
result?
the
actual
backdrop
in
this
case
for
deciding
the
issue
is
briefly
the
following.
mr.
and
mrs.
kozminski,
with
the
help
of
their
son,
john,
ran
a
family
dairy
farm
outside
ann
arbor,
michigan.
in
about
1967,
a
farmhand
named
bob
fulner
was
brought
to
work
on
the
farm.
several
years
later,
in
the
early
1970s,
a
second
man,
lewis
molitoris,
was
brought
to
the
farm
to
work.
both
men
were
moderately
retarded.
they
viewed
the
world
in
much
the
same
way
as
children
between
the
ages
of
seven
and
ten
years
of
age.
the
men
generally
worked
from
3:00
o'clock
in
the
morning
until
8:30
or
9:00
o'clock
at
night,
seven
days
a
week,
no
holidays,
performing
heavy
farm
labor,
including
the
cleaning
of
cow
manure
out
of
the
barn
by
hand
twice
a
day.
they
were
initially
paid
$15
a
week
plus
room
and
board,
but
that
pay
was
reduced
to
$1
a
week
and
then
was
stopped
altogether.
from
about
1980
on,
the
two
men
were
housed
in
an
insect-infested
trailer
that
had
broken
windows,
no
running
water,
no
lights,
and
no
heat.
they
were
dressed
in
torn
clothes
that
did
not
provide
protection
against
the
cold
and
that
remained
filthy
because
the
only
washing
machine
that
was
available
to
them
was
broken.
they
were
denied
medical
assistance
even
when
they
suffered
serious
injuries,
and
were
given
food
consisting
largely
of
mouldy
bread
and
cold
cuts
that
left
them
serious
nutritional
deficiencies.
they
were
regularly
subjected
to
physical
and
verbal
abuse
for
not
working
as
directed.
they
were
told
not
to
leave
the
farm,
and
they
were
threatened
that
they
would
be
sent
to
institutions
if
they
did
so.
both
men--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
we
certainly
feel
that
we
could
prevail
in
this
case
without
the
psychological
testimony.
however,
i
think
that
there
is
a
serious
question
in
this
case
that
would
attach
if
we
were
to
follow
the
sixth
circuit's
standard
because
it
does
not
go
beyond
physical
coercion
unless
you--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--right.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
obviously
is
the
difficulty
that
the
lower
courts
wrestle
with.
the
statute
is
directed
at
a
condition,
which
is
involuntary
servitude,
and
the--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
that
servitude
is,
as
i
understand
the
elements
of
that
statute,
it
would
include
that
a
person
is
made
to
work
for
a
defendant,
to
provide
services
for
that
defendant
against
his
will,
that
that
defendant
has
to
specifically--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--servitude
would
be
to
perform
services
for
the
defendant
who
is
exerting
the
coercion.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
it
contemplates
largely
in
the
employment
relationship.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
am
sorry?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
would
certainly
be
within
the--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--well,
first
the
definition
of
servitude
under
the
thirteenth
amendment
is
one
that
has
been
traditionally
recognized
and
was
at
the
time
to
exclude
certain
relationships,
such
as
the
parent-child
relationship.
i
think
that
beyond
that,
though,
what
you
have
to
look
to
is
why,
what
the
conditions
are,
the
elements
are
for
the
performing
of
the
servitude.
this
is
involuntary
servitude.
it
is
one
that
is
brought
about
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
has,
through
certain
conduct,
intentionally
caused
the
result
of
having
a
victim
provide
the
services
against
his
will,
and
i
think
there
are
three
elements
there
that
are
essential.
you
have
to
show
that
the
person
is
made
to
work
against
his
will.
you
have
to
show
that
that
was
specifically
intended
by
the
defendant.
and
you
have
to
show
that
the
defendant's
conduct
actually
caused
the
intended
result.
and
unless
you
have
all
three
of
those
elements,
then
you
don't
have
the
necessary
evidence
for--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--well,
i
think
that
again
you
have
got
to
have...
that
would
address
the
state
of
mind
of
the
person
who
was
providing
the
services.
that
does
not
suggest
that
there
is
somebody
who
is
exerting
the
kind
of
influence
or
manipulation
over
that
person
to
make
them
work
against
their
will,
nor
do
you
have
the
causal
link.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
there
has
to
be...
i
am
not
sure
psychological
pressure
alone
would
work.
if
you
are
saying,
can
you
posit
a
situation
where
a
parent
would
engage
in
coercive
conduct
of
an
overbearing
nature
with
the
intent
of
forcing
the
child
to
perform
certain
services
that
the
child
felt
compelled
to
do
and
would
otherwise
not
do,
and
that
that
conduct
caused
that
result
to
come
about,
that
would
fall
into
the
realm,
it
seems
to
me,
of
the
kind
of
evidentiary
picture
that
would
have
to
go
to
a
jury
to
decide
the
state
of
mind
of
both
of
the
participants
and
the
causal
link
that
is
necessary.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
generally
the
instruction
that
the
district
court
gave
on
those
elements
are
acceptable.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
there
is
another
element
of
the
case
that
went
to
the
testimony
of...
psychological
testimony
that
we
did
not
bring
to
the
court
that
was
thrown
out
by
the
court
below,
which
is
why
you
would
have
to
have
a
new
trial.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
they
did.
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
the
sixth
circuit
felt
that
their
definition
was
too
broad,
that
you
had
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
conduct
reachable
here
to
physical
coercion.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
right,
i
think
it
should
have
affirmed
the
conviction.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
was
a
proper
instruction.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
would
not
think
that
that
would
be
servitude
for
purposes--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--well,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
what
the
statute
contemplates
as
requiring
that
a
specific
service
be
provided
by
the
individuals
who
are
hazed.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
a
membership
requirement
to
get
into
a
fraternity.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that...
oh,
i
see
what
you...
i
guess
technically
one
could
say
that
would
be
servitude,
although
i
think
if
it
is
a
hazing
thing
it
is
an
aberrational...
i
mean,
it
is
not
to
hold
them
in
service
to
do
work
for
a
term
which
i
think
would
have
to
be
more
than
a--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
guess
the
question
went
to
before
they
got
in.
whether
that--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
it
has
to
be
more
than
unattractive.
i
think
it
has
to
be
so
intolerable
as
to
be
unacceptable,
and
i
would
take
the
death
or
beating.
i
do
think,
for
example--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think,
for
example,
that
you
could
hypothesize
a
case
involving
hypnosis
where
somebody
was
hypnotized
and
told
when
they
woke
up
they
were
going
to
have
the
kind
of
conditions
of
these
two
men
here
and
perform
whatever
tasks
they
were
asked
to
perform
and
would
indeed
be
in
servitude
involuntarily
by
reason
of
hypnosis.
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
a
situation
not
involving
physical
coercion
or
legal
coercion
that
clearly
is
reached
by
the
involuntary
servitude
condition,
so
i
think
it
is
the
case
that
you
can
have
an
involuntary
situation.
more
likely
than
not
what
you
are
going
to
be
wrestling
with
under
involuntary
is
whether
indeed
the
situation
is
so
intolerable
as
to
leave
you
no
viable
choice
but
to
do
the
work.
now,
in
this
case,
for
example--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--well,
and
that
goes
to
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
which
is
the
state
of
the
mind
of
the
victim.
whether
or
not
it
is
so
intolerable
as
to
justify
a--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
there
are
situations
that
could
qualify,
for
example,
where
a
religious...
in
a
religious
situation
where
the
leader
of
the
cult
believed
that
beating
of
children
or
adults
was
the
reflex
response
to
ensure
that
they
would
indeed
adhere
to
him
and
his
edicts,
that
that
could
indeed
get
to
the
point
of
being,
and
kept
them,
kept
people
basically
in
that
kind
of
condition--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--there
again,
i
think
that
you
are
addressing
only
one
feature
of
the
element
of
the
crime.
if
your
father
is
making
demands
of
that
sort
with
the
intent
of
keeping
you
there
against
your
will
knowing
it
will
have
that
and
that
his
particular
conduct
causes
that
to
happen,
and
indeed
you
have
been
left
with
no
viable
alternative,
then
i
think
that
you
would
have
to...
that
would
raise
a
question.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
the...
again,
i
am
not
sure
that
that...
i
don't
think
that
that
does
follow,
because
i
think
what
that
suggests
is
that
the
specific
intent
factor
that
is
necessary
in
the
criminal
case,
and
the
intent
factor
for
the
state
of
mind
of
the
victim
are
a
lot
more
casual
than
they
are
under
this
code.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
certainly
the
prosecutor--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
certainly
the
history
of
this
statute,
the
prosecutors
have
rarely...
this
statute
has
been
used
rarely
by
prosecutors,
i
think
19
times
since
'77,
and
most
of
those
are
in
connection
with
the
migrant
worker
kind
of
a
context,
where
you
have
individuals
brought
over
as
migrant
workers,
and
then
basically
detained
on
the
farm
and
not
allowed
to
go
and
not
paid
wages.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
those
are
factors
that
are
in
the
mix
that
you
have
to
consider,
but
i
think
that
if
you
take
those
two
factors
out
and
you
still
have
the
physical
abuse
and
the
verbal
abuse
and
you
still
have
the
threat
of
institutionalization,
and
you
still
have
the
isolation
that
you
would
have
a
situation
in
this
circumstance,
it
seems
to
me,
where
you
would
still
have
the
case,
and--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
don't
disagree.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don't
disagree
that
it
is
stronger
if
you
are
not
paying
somebody
and
keeping
them
in
the
situation
then
there
is
certainly
more
reason
to--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
that
that
certainly
is
in
the
balance,
and
what
you
have
to
do
is
weigh
that
against
what
it
is...
what
the
pressures
are
on
the
other
side
that
are
being
exerted
by
the
defendant
to
compel
them
to
stay.
that
again
goes
to
the
looking
at
the
coercive
conduct.
i
think
the
mistake
that
was
made
by
the
sixth
circuit
here
is
that
it
said
the
only
thing
you
could
look
to
is
physical
coercion,
and
that
that
was
all
that
as
an
evidentiary
matter
was
allowed
to
be
introduced
to
the
jury
in
terms
of
determining
whether
you
had
the
condition
that
was
condemned,
which
is
the
condition
of
involuntary
servitude.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
right.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
this
has
reference
to--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--the
peonage
situation--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--justice
o'connor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
is
what
the
legal
coercion
would
amount
to,
where
somebody
owes
a
debt
and
is
being
held
to
pay
off
the
debt.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
if
you...
well,
if
you
were...
that
is
coercion.
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
legal
coercion
in
the
same
sense
that
is
understood
by
that
term
as
it
has
been
used,
which
goes
to
basically
holding
somebody
to
pay
off
a
debt
that
they
do
owe.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
on
the
side
of
the
victim?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
more...
it
is
not
very
far
from
that,
but
it
is...
what
we
are
arguing
here
is
that
it
has
to
be...
that
the
victim
has
no
tolerable
choice,
that
effectively
choice
has
been
removed
to
do
anything
but
what
he
is
being
compelled
to
do,
that
on
the...
either
that
he
has
lacked...
has
a
lack
of
capacity
to
make
any
choice,
and
that
is
one
of
the
features
that
is
at
play
in
this
case,
given
the
mental
retardation
of
these
individuals--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
what
has
to
be
demonstrated
is
the
state
of
mind
of
the
victim
with
regard
to
the
conduct
that
that
victim
is
being
subjected
to
as
well
as
the
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant
who
is
exerting
this
kind
of
coercive
conduct
on
him,
and
then
you
have
to
also
prove
that
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
which
was
intended
to
cause
this
result
of
involuntary
servitude
did
in
fact
cause
it,
and
i
think
it
is
that
burden
of
proof
that
provides
ample
protection
against
the
kinds
of
hypotheticals
that
seem
to
be
of
some
concern--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--the
definition
of
involuntary
servitude?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
that
is
not
unusual,
though,
in
criminal
law.
i
mean,
look
at
a
crime
of
kidnapping
or
extortion,
rape.
you
have
the
same
kind
of
situation,
and
the
courts
are
called
upon
all
the
time
to
assess
the
subjective
intent
of
in
those
instances
both
the...
well,
of
the
victim
certainly
and
of
the
specific
intent
of
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime.
that
is
not
a
task
unfamiliar
to
the
criminal
law
or
to
juries,
i
think.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
you
have
to
hold
someone
to
involuntary
servitude
here.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
in
the
kidnappping
statute
you
have
to
hold
them
against
their
will.
in
the
rape
statute
it
has
to
be
without
consent.
in
the
extortion
statutes,
again,
you
have
to
look...
there
is
no...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
element
that
the
jury
has
to
determine
is
the
intent
factor
in
the
same
instance
of
the
two
parties,
and
that
that...
that
that
burden
that
has
to
be
met
is
what
protects
against
the
kind
of
a
hypothetical
that
justice
scalia
offered.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
that
then
is
a
failure
of
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
decisions.
i
mean,
that
would
be
true
than
if
we
simply
limited
it
to
physical
coercion.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
mean,
the
fact
is
that
if
you
are
to...
if
you
reach
that
conclusion
that
proves
too
much.
it
is
the
case
that
there
are
certain
conditions
to
which
someone
is
subjected
to
that
are
so
intolerable
as
to
render
no
other
choice
meaningful.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
guess
at
one
level
one
could
say
that,
although
taking
this
case,
where
you
have
two
individuals
who
view
the
world
in
the
same
eyes
as
children
of
age
seven
to
ten,
and
who
are
convinced
as
to
no
choice
but
to
do
that
which
the
authoritative
figure
instructs
them
to
do,
add
to
that
all
of
the
other
indicia
of
coercion
that
are
in
this
case,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
easy
to
conclude
that
here
these
individuals
believed
that
they
had
no
other
choice
than
to
stay
in
the
circumstances
they
were
in,
and
that
that
was
what
kept
them
there,
notwithstanding
the
kind
of
living
conditions
that
justice
white
mentioned.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
that
is
a
distinction,
though,
that
is
important.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
we
are
talking
here
about
societal
conditions
that
might
lead
one
to
the
conclusion
they
stay
where
they
are.
it
has
to
be
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
that
causes
the...
that
exploits
the
individual
and
causes
the
individual
to
be
compelled
to
stay.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
in
some
respects
that
is
the
factual
backdrop
in
this
case,
where
this
defendant
led
these
two
people
to
believe
that
if
they
did
not
stay
here
that
there
was
nothing
out
there,
no
job,
no
home.
they
would--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--you
might
be
able
to
do
that
if
you
can
demonstrate
that...
there
again,
you
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
defendant
set
about
to
achieve
that
result,
intended
to
achieve
it,
and
that
the
victim--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--well,
that
is
close.
i
think
that
you...
again,
the
lynchpin
in
terms
of
that
is
whether
the
reason
they
stay
around
is
because
the
alternative
is
so
intolerable
as
to
be
wholly
unacceptable,
akin
to
death
or--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
that
in
these
hypotheticals,
that
a
jury
would
be
unlikely
to
convict
because
again
i
think
we
keep
focusing
on
these
hypotheticals
on
one
aspect
as
opposed
to
three
elements.
it
is
not
only
the
state
of
mind
of
the
victim,
it
is
the
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant,
and
it
is
also
the
causal
link
that
says
that
defendant's
conduct,
which
was
intended
to
cause
this
involuntary
servitude
situation,
did
in
fact
cause
it,
and
i
think
with
that
as
being
the
element
of
proof,
that
you
have
the
protections
that
will
ensure
that
the
kinds
of
cases
that
result
in
conviction
are
the
ones
that
have
the
factual
backdrop
such
as
we
have
here.
