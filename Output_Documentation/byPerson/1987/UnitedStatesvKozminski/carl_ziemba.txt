mr.
carl
ziemba
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
first
to
the
fact
that
the
lower
courts
reversed
the
convictions
of
the
defendants
on
two
bases,
and
that
the
solicitor
general
is
not
urging
this
court
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
was
erroneous
in
ordering
a
new
trial.
all
that
the
solicitor
general
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
amend
the
definition
of
involuntary
servitude.
mr.
carl
ziemba
that's
all.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes,
i
just
wanted--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--right,
i
just
wanted
to
make
that
clear.
now,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
definition
of
involuntary
servitude
being
advocated
by
the
solicitor
general
is
too
broad.
it
casts
its
net
too
broadly.
it
is
too
amorphous.
it
is
too
indefinite.
it
leaves
too
much
room
for
the
government
to
decide
what
conduct
is
improper,
leading
to
a
condition
of
which
the
government
disapproves.
this
is
what
the
solicitor
general
states
on
page
30
of
his
brief.
"a
person
may
be
held
to
involuntary
servitude
by
being
intentionally
deprived
of
the
ability
to
make
a
rational
choice
not
to
remain
in
the
master's
service.
"
in
short,
the
servant
or
the
servitor
may
not
be
making
a
complaint
at
all
to
anyone
concerning
his
condition
over
a
period
of
many
years,
but
if
the
government
decides
that
the
condition
of
the
servant
in
the
eyes
of
the
government
is
undesirable,
or
intolerable,
then
the
government
concludes
that
the
servant
has
been
deprived
of
an
ability
to
make
a
rational
choice
to
remain
in
his
condition.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
be
an
application
of
the
post
hoc
ergo
proctor
hoc
argument--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--well,
i
think--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--half
true.
it
was
the
government's
decision
to
present
to
the
jury--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--no,
but
in
answer
to
your--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--in
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes,
but
you
see,
i
am
convinced
that
in
this
particular
case,
and
i--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
was
not
trial
counsel.
i
did
not
move
to
dismiss--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--i
really
can't
recall,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
a
motion
of
that
nature
was
filed.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes,
but
you
see,
i--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
carl
ziemba
the
instruction
should
be
as
defined
by
the
sixth
circuit.
it
should
encompass
the
following
definition.
"we
conclude
that
a
holding
to
involuntary
servitude
occurs
when,
a,
the
servant
believes
that
he
or
she
has
no
viable
alternative
but
to
perform
service
for
the
master,
b,
because
of,
1,
the
master's
use
or
threatened
use
of
physical
force,
or
2,
the
master's
use
or
threatened
use
of
state-imposed
legal
coercion,
for
example,
peonage,
or
3,
the
master's
use
of
fraud
or
deceipt
to
obtain
or
maintain
services
where
the
servant
is
a
minor,
an
immigrant,
or
one
who
is
mentally
incompetent.
"
now,
that
definition
in
my
opinion,
i
respectfully
submit,
embraces
objective
criteria
which
can
be
explained
to
a
jury
and
which
a
jury,
if
they
mean
to
convict,
can
find
factual
bases
for
the
finding
of
the
criteria--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--but
psychological--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--my
personal
opinion,
justice
stevens,
is
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
hypnosis
unless
the
subject
wants
to
be
hypnotized.
i
maintain
that
a
person
who
resists
the
arts
of
the
hypnotist
can
never
be
hypnotized.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
would
say
that
if
a
person
complains
about
being
hypnotized
into
a
particular
pattern
of
conduct,
i
would
say
that
he
voluntarily
undertook
that
pattern
of
conduct
because
he
voluntarily
permitted
himself
to
fall
under
the
sway
of
the
hypnotist.
that
is
the
only
way
hypnosis
can
result.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
think
they
did.
you
must
understand
that
i
am
not
here
to
make
a
brief
for
my
clients
as
to
the
payment
of
wages
and
living
conditions
and
what
have
you.
but
i
think
that
these
two
individuals
found
themselves
in
such
conditions
in
life,
one
was
living
in
a
cardboard
box
in
the
wintertime
along
the
river
in
the
city
of
ann
arbor,
michigan,
and
the
other
one,
i
forget
what,
but
he
had
been
working
on
a
farm
in
the
vicinity
of
the
defendant's
farm.
and
they
both
were
invited
to
come
to
the
farm
to
work.
i
don't
think
they
knew
any
other
type
of
work.
they
were
unskilled.
i
don't...
and
of
course
these
were
bachelors.
these
were
men
without
families.
being
a
bachelor
myself,
i
know
how
bachelors
tend
to
live.
they
don't
tend
to
live
as
orderly
and
as
cleanly
as
women
do.
but
they
were
given
food,
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
all
their
food
was
mouldy.
they
were
given
weekly
supplies
of
food,
and
they
prepared
their
own
food,
and
they
ate
what
they
wanted
to
eat,
and
they
watched
their
television
shows,
and
they
had
a
place
where
they
could
take
a
shower
or
a
both
in
sort
of
a
concrete
bunkhouse.
they
had
25
cats
living
in
the
trailer.
i
would
have
to
judge--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
carl
ziemba
or
they
certainly
loved
cats.
mr.
carl
ziemba
and
there
was
no
interference
with
their
love
of
cats.
mr.
carl
ziemba
and
they
weren't
fenced
in.
there
was
no
firearms
or
anything
of
that
nature,
no
threats
made
that
ill
would
befall
them
if
they
left
forever.
they
went
into
town
periodically.
they
encountered
police
officers
in
town
and
never
made
a
complaint
to
police
officers--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--yes,
and
then
the
follow-up
question
to
the
individual
who
was
one
of
the...
was,
did
that
frighten
you?
did
you
like
being
in
the
institution?
oh,
yes,
i
liked
it
very
much.
i
wouldn't
mind
going
back.
mr.
carl
ziemba
your
honor--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--well,
you
see,
this
is
the
testimony
of
a
tester
of
psychology.
in
other
words,
we
test
intelligence.
we
give
people
intelligence
tests.
what
are
we
really
measuring?
is
it
really
intelligence,
or
is
it
literacy?
can
an
illiterate
basically
intelligent
person,
as
we
all
understand
that
term,
can
such
a
person
pass
the
ordinary
intelligence
test?
i
doubt
it
very
much.
mr.
carl
ziemba
you
take
an
average--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
carl
ziemba
oh,
yes.
the
defendants
called
a
very
highly
respected
psychiatrist
from
the
detroit
area.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
am
sorry?
mr.
carl
ziemba
higher.
higher
qualifications
than--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--there
was
one
for
the--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--prosecution
and
one
for
the
defendant.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
am
sorry?
mr.
carl
ziemba
that
is
a
fact.
mr.
carl
ziemba
well,
i
think
we
have
to
infer
that.
mr.
carl
ziemba
we
have
to
infer
that,
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
that's
true.
mr.
carl
ziemba
well,
sometimes
i
seriously
ask
that
question
of
myself--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--when
the
verdict
comes
in
adversely,
wen
the
question...
when
the
jury
comes
in
with
a
verdict
favorable
to
the
defendant,
i
know
precisely
why
we
have
a
jury.
mr.
carl
ziemba
oh,
i
think
that
falls
under
the
ingalls
case,
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
carl
ziemba
where
the--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--oh,
yes.
oh,
definitely.
that
is
legal
coercion.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
get
the
hounds
of
law
upon
him
and
send
him
away
to
involuntary
incarceration,
yes.
this
is
legal
threat.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
would
think
so,
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
really
haven't
given
consideration
to
the
threat
to
sue
for
an
indebtedness.
i
think
that
that
might...
that
comes
very
close
to
peonage,
i
would
guess
just
off
the
top
of
my
head.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carl
ziemba
that
is--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--no,
no,
that
is
naked
force,
i
would
judge.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
don't
know.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
don't
know.
you
see,
now
we
are
getting
into
that
gray
area
which
we
encounter
in
the
analysis
of
any
criminal
law.
is
it
coercion
to
say
unless
you
perform
according
to
scriptures,
you
will
spend
eternity
in
the
sulfurous
fires
of
hell?
you
see.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no,
i
think
i
was
being
a
little
facetious.
however,
the
danger
in
the
broad
definition
advocated
by
the
solicitor
general
is
this,
that
persons
who
have
a
message
such
as
jesus
christ
and
mohammed
and
moses
had,
and
who
induce
people
to
abandon
everything
they
own
and
to
follow
in
their
steps
and
in
their
example,
and
who
devote
their
lives
to
the
word
given
by
these
charismatic
religious
leaders
might
be
charged
under
the
broad
definition
of,
say,
psychological
coercion,
which
deprived
the
followers
of
a
capacity
to
make
a
rational
judgment
in
the
eyes
of
the
government
as
to
what
they
should
do.
although
they
chose
a
hair
shirt,
chose
to
go
barefooted
through
the
world
with
a
prayer
bowl,
the
government
said,
we
don't
think
that
this
is
an
appropriate
condition
for
a
human
being
to
live
in,
therefore
we
must
conclude
that
there
was
some
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
master,
some
psychological
coercion
which
deprived
the
follower
of
his
capacity
to
make
a
rational
judgment
and
decision
as
to
whether
to
follow
the
leader
to
remain
in
his
service
or
not.
in
my
opinion,
that
is
the
danger
and
the
perniciousness
in
this
broad,
amorphous
definition
being
advocated--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--in
the
case
at
bench?
mr.
carl
ziemba
nothing
that
remotely--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
carl
ziemba
you
see,
if
the
definition
advocated
by
the
solicitor
general
is
adopted
by
this
court
and
this
case
is
tried
according
to
that
definition,
then...
and
if
the
trial
judge
instructs
the
jury
according
to
this
amorphous
definition
of
involuntary
servitude
which
will
embrace
this
nebulous
concept
of
psychological
coercion,
then
the
jury
will
be
left
at
sea
without
chart
or
compass
to
guide
them
in
making
a
determination
whether
or
not
the
master,
the
defendants
actually
did
intend
such
a
consequence,
actually
had
the
capacity
and
the
knowledge
to
subject
somebody
to
psychological
coercion--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--i
don't
think
that
they
would
be
totally
irrelevant
and
inadmissible.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no,
i
certainly
agree
with
your
honor's
observation
that
if
these
two
individuals--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--it
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--of...
yes,
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
would
agree
with
your
honor,
absolutely,
but
then
on
the
other
hand
i
fully
agree
with
justice
stevens
in
his
observation
that
all
of
the
conditions
in
this
case
being
pressed
say--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--you
are
next.
mr.
carl
ziemba
you
are
next,
justice
marshall.
0
[generallaughter.]
all
the
conditions
remain
the
same
but
the
two
individuals
in
this
case
were
paid
$5,000
a
month
for
their
labors,
the
government
would
not
have
made
his
suggestion
of
involuntary
servitude.
what
this
case
really
comes
down
to
is
this.
are
the
defendants
guilty
of
not
paying
minimum
wage
or
a
decent
wage
or
something
of
that
nature?
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
am
sorry?
mr.
carl
ziemba
oh,
they
did,
for
a
while.
mr.
carl
ziemba
well,
they
were
getting
some
payment
in
kind,
food,
weekly
food,
and
they
were
taking--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--when?
mr.
carl
ziemba
very
well,
your
honor.
are
there
any
further
questions?
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
carl
ziemba
something
of
that
nature.
there
was
testimony
to
that
effect.
mr.
carl
ziemba
they
were
taken
into
town
for
sunday
dinner.
i
think
they
were
taken
to
a
baseball
game
maybe
one
or
twice
a
year.
something
of
that
nature.
gratuities.
not
payment,
gratuities.
are
there
any
further
questions?
mr.
carl
ziemba
thank
you.
