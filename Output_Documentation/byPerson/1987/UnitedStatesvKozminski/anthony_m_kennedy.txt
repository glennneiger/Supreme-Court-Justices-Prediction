i
take
it,
mr.
reynolds,
that
you
would
not
accept
the
same
definition
in
this
case
as
you
would
in
a
criminal
case
for
the
law
of
duress.
a
criminal
defendant
claims
that
he
was
forced
to
do
something,
and
the
government
always
takes
a
very
strict
line
there.
duress
is
permitted
only
if
there
is
no
reasonable
means
of
escaping
imminent
physical
harm.
i
take
it
you
argue
for
something
more
broad
than
that.
justice
kennedy
yes.

that
is
just
a
subjective
component.
there
is
no
objective
component
as
well,
that
a
reasonable
person
would
have
to
believe
he
or
she
had
no
choice?
justice
kennedy
what
should
the
instruction
be,
in
your
view?
