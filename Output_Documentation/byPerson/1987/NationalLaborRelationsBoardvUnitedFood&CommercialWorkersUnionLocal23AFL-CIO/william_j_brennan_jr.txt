justice
jr.
does
the
regional
director
decide
the
complaint
solution?
justice
jr.
he's
not
the
board's
representative?
justice
jr.
there's
something
in
the
way
of
a
case.
he
may
try
then
to
effect
settlement,
is
that
correct?
justice
jr.
but
suppose
the
party
doesn't
want
to
engage
in
any
settlement
discussions,
does
he
have
an
appeal?
justice
jr.
oh.
the
regional
director
issues
a
complaint.
justice
jr.
and
the
party
against
whom
it's
issued
has
no
appeal
to
the
general
counsel
before
he
has
to
answer
the
complaint,
does
he?
justice
jr.
where
there's
a
formal
settlement,
any
order
of
the
board
is
subject
to
judicial
review,
is
it?
justice
jr.
and
the
question
we
have
here
is
whether
where
there's
an
informal
settlement,
is
it
subject
to
judicial
review.
justice
jr.
do
we
have
any
other
issue
to
decide
in
this
case?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
come,
in
the
ninety-two
percent
of
the
cases
settled
how
many
are...
what
proportion
are
informal
and
what
proportion
formal?
justice
jr.
when
you
say
vast,
is
that
half
of
the
ninety-two
percent
or
three-quarters
or
what?
justice
jr.
but
in
either
event,
neither
is
subject
to
judicial
review,
is
it,
pre
or
post?
justice
jr.
mr.
gold,
is
anything
judicially
reviewable
that
does
not
involve
a
board
order?
justice
jr.
yes.
well,
then,
if
that's
so,
in
these
informal
settlements,
is
there
any
board
order?
justice
jr.
no.
is
there?
justice
jr.
and
what
is
it?
justice
jr.
even
though
there
exists
no
formal
board
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
question
to
be
decided
is
whether
a
federal
court
has
authority
to
review
a
decision
of
the
general
counsel
in
national
labor
relations
board
dismissing
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
pursuant
to
an
informal
settlement.
we
hold
that
such
a
dismissal
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review
on
either
the
amended
national
labor
relations
act
or
the
administrative
procedure
act
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
action
under
either
act.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit
concluding
that
it
had
jurisdiction
and
amend
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
cause
for
the
want
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
justice
scalia
joins
the
court
opinion
and
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
he
was
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
white
and
o'connor.
