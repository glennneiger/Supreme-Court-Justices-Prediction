chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
cause
number
86-594,
national
labor
relations
board
v.
united
food
and
commercial
workers
union.
mr.
come,
you
may
proceed
when
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
difference,
mr.
come,
between
a
formal
settlement
and
an
informal
settlement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
as
between
formal
and
informal
settlements
after
complaint
issues,
what
is
roughly
thirty-five
percent
of
the
total
universe
is
informal,
and.6
percent
is
formal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
come.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that's
true,
what
issues
are
there
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
that
you
say
you
have
a
right
to?
is
that
just
what
the
charging
party
wants
to
litigate?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
a
district
court
ordinarily
doesn't
conduct
any
hearing
if
the
parties
stipulate
to
a
settlement.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
charging
party.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
what,
then,
are
the
issues?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
what
are
those
issues?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
a
review
of
the
general
counsel's
exercise
of
his
discretion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
take
the
stage
of
the
proceeding
where
the
general
counsel
issued
a
complaint
but
the
charge
party
has
issued
no
response.
now,
you
say
a
settlement
even
at
that
stage
requires...
you're
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
it
is
reviewable.
now,
that's
not
like
your
district
court
proceeding
at
all,
it
seems
to
me.
that's
where
the
plaintiff
has
filed
a
complaint,
the
defendant
hasn't
filed
an
answer,
and
that's
dismissable
at
the
will
of
the
plaintiff
in
the
district
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
were
arguing
before
that
you
had
the
same
kind
of
hearing
that
a
district
court
would
have.
i
thought
you
meant
that
the
proceedings
were
analogous;
they're
really
not
analogous.
chief
justice
rehnquist
those
district
court
case
examples
have
gone
considerably
further
than
just
the
filing
of
a
complaint,
which
is
all
we
have
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
come,
do
you
have
anything
in
rebuttal?
you
have
five
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
come,
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-594,
national
labor
relations
board
versus
united
food
&
commercial
workers
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
