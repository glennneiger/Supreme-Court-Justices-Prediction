mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
questions.
one,
whether
the
withdrawal
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
pursuant
to
an
informal
settlement
entered
into
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
hearing
on
the
complaint
constitutes
agency
action
that
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
second
question
is
whether,
assuming
that
the
gc's
action
is
subject
to
judicial
review,
the
general
counsel
must
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
whenever
the
party
who
file
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
objects
to
the
settlement
agreement.
now,
before
addressing
these
questions,
i
should
like
to
spend
a
few
minutes
outlining
the
statutory
scheme
and
the
board's
procedures
for
implementing
it
because
i
think
it's
important
to
understanding
the
resolution
of
the
question.
the
national
labor
relations
board
confers
upon
the
national
labor
relations
board
authority
to
prevent
any
person
from
engaging
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
affecting
commerce,
and
it
sets
forth
in
general
terms
the
procedure
to
be
followed
in
determining
whether
an
employer
or
a
union
has
engaged
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
appropriate
order,
therefore.
however,
section
3(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
provides
that
the
board's
general
counsel,
who
is
a
statutory
officer
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
consent
of
the
senate,
shall
have
final
authority
on
behalf
of
the
board
in
respect
to
the
investigation
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
and
the
issuance
of
complaints
in
respect
the
prosecution
of
such
complaints
before
the
board.
now,
the
procedure
the
board
has
devised
attempts
to
effectuate
this
separation
that
3(d)
makes
between
the
board's
prosecutory
authority
on
the
one
hand
and
its
adjudicatory
authority
on
the
other.
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
case
is
initiated
by
the
filing
of
a
charge.
it's
investigated
by
the
regional
director,
and
if
the
investigation
indicates
the
charge
has
merits,--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--any
person
may
file
a
charge.
in
this
case,
it
was
filed
by
the
food
and
commercial
workers
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
usually
the
charges
are
filed
by
the
employer
or
an
employee
or
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
between
two
unions
and
an
employer.
if
the
investigation
reveals
that
the
charge
does
not
have
merit,
it
is
either
withdrawn
or
dismissed,
in
which
case
the
charging
party
has
an
appeal
to
the
board's
general
counsel.
if
the
regional
director
concludes
that
it
has
merit,
he
affords
an
opportunity
for
a
settlement
of
the
charge.
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
the
settlement
is
usually
what
is
called
an
informal
settlement,
which
does
not
require
the
entry
of
a
board
order
or
a
court
decree.
it
consists
of
a
commitment
by
the
charge
party
to
take
the
agreed-upon
remedial
action
and
the
case
is
closed
upon
compliance
with
that
commitment.
if,
later,
there
is
a
failure
to
comply,
the
charge,
the
prosecution
of
the
charge
can
be
resumed.
now,
if
no
settlement
is
reached
at
this
stage,
a
complaint
issues,
and
if
the
complaint
goes
to
hearing,--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--the
regional
director
does.
he's
acting
as
the
agent
of
the
general
counsel.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
he's
not
the
board's
representative.
he...
the
statute,
as
i
indicated,
gives
the
regional
director
final
authority
over
the
investigation
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
the
statute
also
gives
the
general
counsel
supervision
over
the
employees
and
the
regional
offices,
and
when
the
regional
director
is
working
on
the
unfair
labor
practice
phase
of
the
proceeding,
he
is
exercising
the
general
counsel's
3(d)
authority.
when
he's
working
on
representation
cases,
which
lead
to
elections,
he
is
also
working
under
the
supervision
of
the
general
counsel,
but,
there,
the
general
counsel
has
been
delegated
by
the
board
the
authority
to
handle
representation,
supervise
the
handling
of
representation
cases.
but
with
respect
to
the
complaint
phase,
the
regional
director
is
acting
as
the
agent
of
the
general
counsel.
surprisingly,
these
things,
over
time,
have
been
kept
straight,
although
it
may
seem
difficult
to
conceive
of
it.
but
if
a
settlement
cannot
be
reached,
as
i
indicated,
the
case...
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
at
that
point,
he
issues
a
complaint.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
issues
a
complaint.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
normally.
i
mean,
the
procedure
on
appeal
is
usually
invoked
where
a
charge
is
dismissed,
but,
as
i
say,
after
a
complaint
issues,
it
may
go
to
formal
hearing,
but
there
is
usually
a
two
to
three
month
period
between
the
issuance
of
the
complaint
and
the
formal
hearing,
and
during
that
time,
there
is
further
opportunity
for
settlement
of
the
case
or
the
complaint
may
be
withdrawn
because
the
regional
director,
in
preparing
for
trial,
finds
that
his
evidence
just
won't
stand
up.
now,
under
the
board's
rules,
the
regional
director
can
withdraw
a
complaint
prior
to
hearing
on
his
own
motion.
this
is
a
provision
that's
been
in
the
rules,
even
way
back
in
the
wagner
act
days.
similarly,
as
i
said,
he
can
enter
into
a
settlement
agreement.
at
this
stage,
the
post-complaint
stage,
the
settlement
agreements
can
be
of
two
forms.
you
can
have
a
formal
settlement,
which
provides
for
a
board
order
and
often
a
consent
decree,
and
that
goes
on
up
to
the
board
because
it
requires
a
board
order
and
board
approval.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
set
forth
at
the
appendix
to
our
brief
the
board's
regulations
with
respect
to
the
settlement
procedure.
mr.
norton
j.
come
those
regulations
were
promulgated
many
years
ago.
in
general
form,
they
were
in
the
act
from
right
after
the
start
of
taft-hartley
and,
then
about
twenty-two
years
ago,
they
got
amplified,
but,
essentially,
this
procedure
has
been
a
long-standing
procedure
that
was
worked
out
by
the
board
and
the
general
counsel
right
after
the
enactment
of
taft-hartley
in
an
effort
to
make
3(d)
mesh
with
the
board's
adjudicatory
procedures.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
for
housekeeping
purposes,
congress
decided
instead
of
setting
up
a
separate
administrator
to
put
the
general
counsel
in
the
same
agency
as
the
board,
and
the
way
these
regulations
work
out
or
have
worked
out
is
that
although
they
are
issued
in
the
name
of
the
board,
those
having
to
do
with
the
operation
of
the
general
counsel's
phase
of
the
administration
are
worked
out
jointly
with
the
board
and
the
general
counsel.
there
is
a
joint
committee
that
has
worked
on
these
regulations.
what
would
happen
if
you
got
to
a
point
where
you
couldn't
have
agreement
is
an
interesting
question,
but
that
has
not,
fortunately,
been
the
case.
now,
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
formal
settlement,
but
an
informal
settlement
that
was
worked
out
post-complaint.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
informal
settlement.
mr.
norton
j.
come
if,
only
if,
you
decide
that
it
is
subject
to
judicial
review,
would
you
have
to
reach
the
second
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
charging
party
who
objects
at
the
settlement
is
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
its
objections
because
that
is
what
the
3rd
circuit
held
and
the
remand
is
for
the
board
to
hold
such
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
general
counsel
cannot
do
that
unilaterally.
once
it
goes
to
hearing,
the
adjudicatory
process
is
invoked
and
the
withdrawal
of
the
complaint
or
any
settlement
agreement
that's
entered
into
would
have
to
be
with
the
approval
of
the
administrative
law
judge
and
an
appeal
lies
from
that
to
the
board.
so
that
what
we're
really
talking
about
here
is
a
very
narrow
time
span,
as
it
were.
the
period
after
issuance
of
the
complaint
and
prior
to
the
opening
of
the
hearing.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
difference
is
that
a
formal
settlement
leads
to
a
board
order
that
is
enforceable
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
so
that
if
there
is
non-compliance
with
that
order,
the
board
can
either
proceed
to
get
it
enforced
on
consent
or,
if
there
was
a
consent
also
to
a
court
decree,
move
for
contempt
of
the
order.
with
respect
to
an
informal
settlement,
the
only
consequence
is
that
the
prosecution
of
the
case
is
stopped,
and
if
there
is
compliance
with
the
commitment,
the
case
is
closed
on
compliance.
if
it
should
subsequently
it
appear
that
there
is
not
compliance,
then
the
settlement
is
withdrawn
and
the
general
counsel
is
free
to
resume
the
prosecution
of
the
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
he
acts
in
the
public
interest
here
and
there's
no
estoppel,
as
it
were,
that
would
operate
against
him,
but--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--i
wouldn't
say
never,
but
if
it's
ever
happened,
it's
so
rare
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--no.
i
mean,
these
settlements
play
a
very
key
role
in
the
administration
of
the
act.
the
board
settles
over
ninety-two
percent
of
its
cases,
and
as
the
attorney
general's
committee
pointed
out
in
its
seminole
study
back
in
1941,
it's
the
life
blood
of
the
administrative
process,
and
so
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--there's
a
substantial
number
pre-complaint.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
there
are.
there
are
about
thirty-five
percent,
according
to
the
'83
statistics,
that
we
have
in
our
brief,
of
which
most
of
those
are
post-complaint
informal
settlements.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
experience
has
shown
that
many
times
parties
are
not
going
to
settle
a
case
until
you
get
them
on
the
courthouse
steps,
and,
so,--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--we
have
not
had
many
cases.
however,
that
is
not
to
say
that
if
it
were
established
by
this
court
that
there
is
a
right
to
review
and
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--in
the
3rd
circuit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
the
3rd
circuit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
as
i
say,
the
potential
would
be
there
and
human
nature
being
what
it
is,
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
expect
that
if
there
were
not
only
the
right
to
review
but
also
the
right
to
board
review,
as
my
brother
here
is
urging,
that
a
party
for
technical
reasons
would
play
out
the
string
here,
and
this
isn't
just
a
labor
versus
management-kind
of
issue
because
the
employer
can
be
in
the
role
of
the
objecting
party
as
can
the
union,
and
experience
has
shown
that
in
order
to
resolve
most
effectively
labor-management
disputes,
the...
it's
better
to
get
things
resolved
quickly
and
with
some
degree
of
certainty
and
that
if
you
tack
on
review
to
an
informal
settlement,
there
would
be
a
strong
disincentive
to
settle
because
one
of
the
reasons
for
settling
is
to
avoid
the
cost
and
also
the
risk
of
litigation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
that
the
vast
majority
are
informal
settlements
and,
of
those,--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
in
the
1983
statistics,
which
we
have
in
our
brief,
the
formal
settlements
were
about
six-tenths
of
a
percent
of
the
total
number
of
settlements.
so,
the
informals
are
really
the
bulk
of
the
settlements.
of
those,
about
sixty-five
percent
occur
before
complaint
and
you've
got
about
thirty-five
percent
remainder.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
with
the
possible
exception
that
an
informal
that
is
entered
into
after
hearing,
where
you
have
to
get
the
approval
of
the
administrative
law
judge
and
the
board,
those...
there
have
been
two
such
cases
in
the
7th
circuit
and
those
have
been
reviewed.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the.6
percent...
yes,
that's
about
right,
your
honor.
those
statistics
are
set
forth
in
table
7
of
the
1983
annual
report,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
most
recent
report
that
has
been
published,
but,
currently,
the
mix
is
not
to
dissimilar.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
because
it
hasn't
resulted
in
a
board
order
in
the
conventional
sense
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
i
think
that
it
is,
and
that's
why
we've...
those
have
been
reviewed.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
norton
j.
come
just
a
couple
of
points,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
congress'
basic
intention
in
enacting
3(d)
was
to
separate
the
board's
prosecutorial
authority
from
its
adjudicatory
authority.
at
the
time
of
the
'47
amendments,
the
board
had
delegated
some
of
its
prosecutorial
authority,
but
it
had
retained
some
aspects
of
it.
we
submit
it
is
clearly
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
congress
intended
to
freeze
the
situation
which
would
have
left
prosecutorial
authority
that
the
board
was
continuing
to
exercise
still
with
the
board.
so,
the
point
that
congress
intended
to
freeze
the
situation
pre
'47
just
doesn't
stand
up.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not,
we
believe,
certainly
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
complaint,
and--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--post-complaint,
i
think
that
the
board
could
not
go
back
to
the
point
of
the
issuance
of
the
complaint
without
doing
violence
to
3(d)
because
3(d)
talks
about
the
general
counsel's
final
authority,
extending
not
only
to
the
investigation
of
charges
and
the
issuance
of
complaints,
but
with
respect
to
the
prosecution
of
such
complaints
before
the
board.
so,
you
have
to
allow
some
room
post-complaint
for
the
general
counsel's
final
authority
to
operate
in.
mr.
norton
j.
come
at
least
up
until
before
the
hearing
opens.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--no.
at
that
point,
i
think
that
the
adjudicatory
process
has
commenced
and
that
the
board
as
the
adjudicator
has
the
inherent
authority
of
all
adjudicatory
bodies
to
regulate
the
order
of
proceedings
once
the
adjudicatory
phase
has
opened,
and
barring
any
restriction
in
the
statute,
which
there
is
none
here,
the
board
was
reasonable
in
drawing
the
line
at
the
opening
of
the
hearing.
now,
my
last
point
is
that
with
respect
to--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
regard
that
as
an
informal
settlement.
the
formal
settlement
requires
a
board
order
that
requires
a
party
to
do
something.
now,
whether
that
order
provides
for
enforcement
by
a
court
of
appeals
or
not
does
not
deprive
it
of
being
a
formal
settlement
because
since
the
order...
the
parties
have
consented
to
the
order,
the
board
can
go
into
the
court
of
appeals
and
get
automatic
enforcement
of
that
order
because
under
10(e)
the
respondent
has
waived
his
right
to
contest
the
order
and
we
have
done
that.
my
last
point
is
that
we
read
10(f)
the
way
you
have
suggested.
judge
scalia,
as
the
type
of
order
that
is
referred
to
is
a
10(c)
order,
and
that
is
made
even
plainer
when
you
look
at
10(e),
which
is
the
provision
for
the
board--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--to
go
for
enforcement.
mr.
norton
j.
come
right.
