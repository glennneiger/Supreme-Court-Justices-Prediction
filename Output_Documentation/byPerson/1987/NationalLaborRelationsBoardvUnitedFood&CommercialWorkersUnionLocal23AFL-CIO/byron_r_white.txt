justice

where
does
the
charge
come
from?
justice
white
you
mean
just
any
person
in
the
united
states?
justice
white
whether
he's
an
employer
or
employee?
justice
white
these
settlements
are
provided
for
by
regulations,
aren't
they?
justice
white
and
both
the
formal
and
the
informal?
justice
white
does
it
indicate
how
old
those
regulations
are?
justice
white
mr.
gold,
if
the
government
is
right,
i
take
it
that
the
board
itself
could
not
prohibit
the
general
counsel
from
entering
into
informal
settlements.
justice
white
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
same
trump
card
if
the
proceeding
has
started,
if
the
hearing
has
started?
justice
white
formal
or
informal
or
whatever?
justice
white
mr.
gold,
the
due
process
concerns
that
motivated
taft-hartley
weren't
basically
concerns
about
fairness
to
the
charging
party,
were
they?
justice
white
you
think
they've
just
been
making
a
mistake
for
thirty
years,
forty
years?
justice
white
this
whole--
justice
white
--practice
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time.
justice
white
mr.
come,
could
the
board
require
informal
settlements
by
the
general
counsel
to
be
reviewed
by
the
board?
justice
white
well,
what
about
in
this
very
case?
justice
white
so,
your
answer
is
no,
the
board
could
not
require
him
to
get
the
approval
of
the
board
for
informal
settlements
after
the
complaint
is
issued?
justice
white
well,
what...
why
wouldn't
that
same
rule
apply
to
post-hearing
while
the
hearing
is
going
on?
what
if
the
general
counsel
wants
to
settle?
justice
white
i
take
it
you
agree
then
that
the
board
has
to
agree.
justice
white
you
mean
the
board
and
the
general
counsel
was
reasonable?
