mr.
come,
doesn't
that
ninety-two
percent
figure
cover
settlements
pre-complaint?
justice
stevens
are
there
very
many
of
these
post-complaint
pre-hearing
settlements?
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
question
on
the
universe
we're
dealing
with.
how
often
in
those
settlements
does
the
charging
party
seek
review
as
they
did
here?
fairly
rare,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
there's
been
a
right
to
review
in
the
6th
circuit
for
twenty
years
without
any
cases,
hasn't
there?
justice
stevens
3rd
circuit,
i
mean.
justice
stevens
twenty
years,
they
had
this
rule,
and
nobody
ever
used
it
for
twenty
years,
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
mr.
gold,
if
you
take
the
language
of
10(f)
literally,
the
review
should
be
directly
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stevens
and
where
then
does
the
authority
for
the
evidentiary
hearing
come?
justice
stevens
so
that
your
position...
just
so
i'm
clear,
is
it
if
a
general
counsel
dismisses
a
complaint
and
they
say
it's
not
reviewable
before
the
board,
you
say
your
remedy
is
to
go
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stevens
hearing
before
whom?
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
say
that
hearing
is
commanded
by
10(f)?
justice
stevens
what
statutory
provision
commands
that
hearing?
justice
stevens
you
said
here
one
of
the
parties
hasn't
agreed
to
the
settlement.
did
the...
the
charging
party
isn't
necessarily
or
automatically
a
party
to
the
complaint
hearing.
doesn't
he
have
to
give
an
order
to
intervene?
what
is
this?
see,
i
just
don't...
what
is
this?
justice
stevens
even
without
a
special
order
of
intervention?
justice
stevens
he's
automatically
a
party.
i
see.
mr.
gold,
i'd
like
to
ask
a
question.
it
relates
to
justice
stevens'
question
earlier
about
whether
this
belongs
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
you're
reading
10(f),
any
person
aggrieved
by
a
final
order
of
the
board,
as
meaning
any
order
of
the
board,
any
final
order
of
the
board.
