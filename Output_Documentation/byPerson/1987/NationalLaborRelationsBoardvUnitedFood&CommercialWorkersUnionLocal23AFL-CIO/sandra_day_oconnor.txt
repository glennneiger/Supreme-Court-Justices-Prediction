justice
o'connor
mr.
come,
if
the
case
had
proceeded
far
enough
to
have
a
hearing,
at
that
point,
is
there
any
authority
to
settle
the
case
and
dismiss
it
on
the
part
of
the
general
counsel
alone?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
gold,
the
statute
certainly
doesn't
expressly
make
that
clear.
justice
o'connor
is
this
not
a
case
where
some
difference
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
the
agency
is
due?
justice
o'connor
it's
been
consistent
since
then?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that's
an
unreasonable
interpretation
of
this
language
of
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
mr.
gold,
if
you
were
right
in
your
interpretation,
then,
presumably,
even
an
order
withdrawing,
deciding
not
to
file
a
complaint
in
the
first
instance,
would
be
a
final
order
by
the
board.
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
i
just
think
your
logic
would
carry
you
to
a
very
peculiar
place.
justice
o'connor
for
every
action
that
the
general
counsel
takes
is
automatically
a
final
order
of
the
board
by
your
reading
of
the
statute,
then
even
his
decision
not
to
file
a
complaint
would
be
reviewable.
justice
o'connor
but
if
you
apply
the
apa
to
this,
under
your
reading,
of
section
153(d),
anything
the
general
counsel
did
becomes
a
final
order
of
the
board.
