mr.
laurence
e.
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
mr.
come
has
indicated,
the
issue
here
is
the
reviewability
of
the
settlement
that
was
made
over
the
opposition
of
the
union
which
was
the
charging
party,
the
food
and
commercial
workers
union.
the
same
issue
would
be
presented
whether
the
charging
party
were
a
union
or
an
employer.
the
system
works
the
same
way
whomever
has
filed
the
charge.
it's
our
view
that
what
congress
intended
in
1947
was
to
provide
that
settlements
that
are
entered
into
post-complaint
are
to
be
presented
to
the
board
itself
and
that
the
requirement
is
across-the-board
whether
or
not
the
settlement
is
labelled
informal
or
formal.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no.
the--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--in
this
instance,
your
honor,
we
do
think
that
the
statute
pushes
very
hard
in
the
direction
of
the
position
we
take
and
that
this
is
what
the
understanding
was
at
the
time.
it's
very
difficult
to
understand
exactly
how
it
is
that
the
board
has
come
to
the
conclusion
it
has.
originally,
right
after
the
enactment
of
taft-hartley,
the
position
we
urged
was
the
position
that
was
followed
by
the
board.
one
year
later,
without
any
explanation,
the
board
changed
its
view
and
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes,
it
has
been
consistent
since
then,
but--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
think
that
it's
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
cuts
very
deeply
against
the
statutory
provisions
and,
moreover,
as
the
discussion
thus
far
has
indicated,
it
is
an
interpretation
of
a
statute
which
has
resulted
in
a
number
of
lines
being
drawn,
none
of
which
seems
to
have
much
in
the
way
of
logic.
first
of
all,
there's
a
line
between
an
informal
settlement
and
a
formal
settlement,
but
an
informal
settlement
is
what
the
general
counsel
says
it
is
and
the
formal
settlement
is
what
the
general
counsel
says
that
is.
formal
settlements
do
not
necessarily
create
any
enforceable
rights
in
court.
so,
that's
line
number
one,
which
this
system
creates.
line
number
two
is
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that
isn't
the
way
it
works.
there
are
really
three
kinds
of
settlements.
they're
informal
settlements
which
the
general
counsel
enters
into
on
his
or
her
own
hook.
they're
formal
settlements
that
don't
provide
for
court
enforcement,
which
are
presented
to
the
board,
and
it
results
in
a
board
order,
and
then--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--they
produce
a
board
order,
it
would
seem
to
me,
in
the
sense
that
under
10(f),
it's
certainly
an
order
of
the
board
and
nobody
would
protest
that
it's
not
reviewable.
on
the
other
hand,
the
order
does
not
provide
for
court
enforcement
if
there's
back
sliding--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--by
the
respondent.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
that
is
my
understanding,
but,
at
any
rate,
then
there
is
another
kind
of
settlement,
a
settlement
in
which
the
board
demands
that
you
consent
to
court
enforcement
in
a
contempt-like
action,
as
if
you
had
been
through
the
whole
proceeding.
and
all
i'm
saying
is
that
this
system,
which
has
grown
like
topsy,
divides
these
up
according,
more
or
less,
at
least
between
informal
settlement,
kind
number
one,
and
informal
settlement,
kind
number
two,
according
to
the
general
counsel's
whim.
next,
there
is
the
rule
that
if
the
matter
goes
to
hearing,
then
there
has
to
be
the
kind
of
presentment
to
the
board
which
we
think
congress
intended
for
all
post-complaint
cases.
thus,
insofar
as
this
is
an
administrative
system
which
has
grown
up
without
much
scrutiny,
without
much
judicial
consideration,
and
relatively
little
board
consideration,
it
was
neither
the
original
understanding
nor
is
it
an
understanding--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--as
we
read
10(e)
and
10(f),
you
need
a
board
order,
but--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--the
language
of
the
statute--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--we
think
so.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
language
of
the
statute
says
that
orders
of
the
board
are
reviewable
in
court
or
at
least
certain
kinds
of
orders
of
the
board
are
reviewable
in
court.
it
also
says
under
section
3(d)
that
the
general
counsel
acts
on
behalf
of
the
board.
we
don't
believe,
for
example,
if
the
general
counsel
entered
into
something
called
a
formal
settlement
and
didn't
use
the
right
processes,
we
think
that
would
be
reviewable
in
court.
we
don't
think
that
this
kind
of--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
but
a
general
counsel
order
having
all
the
substance
of
the
board
order,
we
believe,
is
judicially
reviewable
under
10(e)
and
10(f)--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no.
i
don't
believe
that.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
there--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no,
we
don't
think
that
that's
what
the
statute
says,
your
honor.
if
i
could,
section
10(f)
says
that
"any
person
aggrieved
by
a
final
order
of
the
board
granting
or
denying
in
whole
or
in
part
the
relief
sought
may
obtain
a
review
of
such
order
in
any
circuit
court
of
appeals.
"
the
understanding
of
that
language--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--there's
an
exception
in
the
apa
for
matters
left
to
agency
discretion.
my
point
about
10(e)
and
10(f)
and
the
understanding
pre-1947
as
well
as
post-1947
is
that
the
reference
to
a
final
order
of
the
board
granting
or
denying
in
whole
or
in
part
the
relief
sought
is
the
relief
sought
in
the
complaint,
not
the
relief
that
the
individual
comes
to
the
agency
and
asks
to
be
embodied
in
a
complaint.
the
request
of
somebody
to
have
a
complaint
issued
and
the
refusal
to
do
so
was
not
reviewable
prior
to
1947,
and
we
don't
believe
that
it's
reviewable
now.
the
language
was
the
same
in
this
instance
pre-1947
and
post-1947.
so,
we
think
that
the
logic
of
the
statute,
both
before
1947
and
after,
is
that
there
is
a
line
that
congress
drew.
they're
informal
proceedings
in
which
the
individual
comes
to
the
agency,
says
i
have
a
charge
of
a
violation
which
has
merit,
please
create
a
formal
proceeding
by
issuing
a
complaint,
and
the
situation
after
the
complaint
issues,
in
which
there
is
a
formal
proceeding.
we
think
that
those
formal
proceedings,
as
is
true
in
a
variety
of
formal
proceedings,
were
intended
to
be
terminated
only
with
the
approval
of
the
adjudicatory
agency.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
we
believe
that
this
was
congress'
understanding,
clear
understanding,
that
the
filing
of
the
complaint
was
like
the
filing
of
a
complaint
in
court
and
answer
after
which
you
can
only
withdraw
the
case
with
judicial
approval
or
the
filing
of
a
criminal
case
in
court
which
reaches
a
certain
procedure
which,
again,
can
only
be
settled
or
withdrawn
with
the
approval
of
the
tribunal.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes,
and
that
is
what
we
did
here.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
we
had...
we
are
making
a
procedural
complaint.
so,
it
is
that
we
did
not
get
the
procedure
we
were
due
in
the
agency.
i
take
it--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
we
are
saying
that
whether
the
general
counsel
issues
something
called
an
order
finding
the
respondent
in
violation
without
going
through
the
procedures
and
the
respondent
says
wait
a
minute
and
seeks
review
of
that
or
whether
the
general
counsel
goes
the
other
way,
that
where
there
is
a
settlement
issue,
that
the
procedure
we
are
due
under
the
statute
is
a
hearing
on
the
settlement,
if
there
isn't
an
amicable
agreement,
in
this
three-party--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--lawsuit...
a
hearing
before
an
administrative
law
judge
and
the
board.
in
other
words,
that
we--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no,
no.
we're
saying
that
that...
the--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--right.
seems
to
us
that
10(a)
and
10(b)
demand
that.
there's
an
internal
system
for
handling
complaints,
and
we're
saying
that
part
of
that
internal
system
within
the
agency
for
handling
complaints
is
that
once
the
complaint
issues,
the
statute
contemplates
that
the
board
will
determine
what
happens
to
the
case
and
the
board
has
all
the
options
as
an
agency
that
any
other
agency
has
or
that
a
court
has.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
it
would
be
the...
in
our
view,
it
is
the
same
kind
of
hearing
that
a
district
court
would
conduct.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
but
here
one
party
doesn't.
obviously,
if
all
the
parties
stipulate
to
the
settlement,
it's
like
a
summary
judgment
case.
the
proposition
that
there
has
to
be
a
hearing
doesn't
make
any
sense,
but,
here,
a
party,
namely
the
charging
party,--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--doesn't
agree
and
that's
why--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--the
issues
are
it
would
seem
to
us
the
same
kind
of
issues
that
a
district
court
has
to--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--whether
it
is
fit
and
proper
for
the
settlement
to
be
entered
into,
whether
it
carries
out
the
intent
of
the
act,
whether
there
have
been
irregularities.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
in
the...
the
only
reason
i'm
afraid
of
that
statement,
chief
justice,
is
that
it
says
you
said
"his
discretion".
we
don't
believe
that
in
that
regard
he
has
a
discretion,
any
more...
that
he
has
an
unfettered
discretion.
let
me
put
it
that
way.
obviously,
there
is
a
discretion
in
that
the
general
counsel's
view
are
going
to
weigh
very
heavily
with
the
hearing,
just
the
way
the
prosecutor's
views
or
the
plaintiff's
views
are
going
to
weigh
very
heavily
with
the
court.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
the
statute
and
the
rules
contemplate
that
the
charging
party
is
a
party
to
the
proceeding.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
any
order
finally
disposing
of
a
complaint.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
in
other
words,
we
don't...
prior
to
1947,
and
correctly
in
our
judgment,
the
actions
of
the
agency
when
it
was
a
unitary
agency
with
regard
to
whether
a
complaint
was
issued,
has
never
been
regarded
as
reviewable.
we
think
that
the
intent
of
10(f)
was
correctly
captured
in
those
decisions.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it's
partially
the
kind
of
order
because
you
have...
in
part,
it
is
that
kind
of
order,
and
what
we're...
i
guess
what
we're
struggling
with
is
what
happens
in
this
class
of
case.
the
defendant
comes
in
and
says
i
am
prepared
not
to
fight
on
issues
1,
2,
3
and
4,
if
you
enter
an
order
which
doesn't
carry
any
court
consequence.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
the
order--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
in
those
terms,
an
order...
there's
more
of
10(c).
an
order
saying
that
there
is
no
unfair
labor
practice
wouldn't
be
reviewable,
but,
obviously,
both
10(c)
and
the
logic
of
the
situation
indicate
that
an
order
saying
that
there's
a
violation,
an
order
saying
that
there's
not
a
violation,
are
reviewable.
now,
what
about
an
order
saying
that
the
respondent
will
consent
to
an
order
which
doesn't
carry
a
contempt
sanction,
saying
that
he
will
not
do
certain
things
which
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
individual
who
brought
the
charge
and
who
has
a
recognized
status
says
that's
not
enough?
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
if
we--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--perhaps
it's
where
it
should
be
if
you're
fighting
about
the
substance
of
the
settlement,
but
if
the
claim
is
that
the
general
counsel
has
run
around
the
procedure
entirely,
so...
and
has
taken
an
action
which
is
in
reality
an
action
which
we
believe
is
an
action
which
can
only
be
taken
by
the
board,
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
logic
of
the
situation
was
that
kind
of
law
question,
when,
as
well,
and
ostensibly
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
argue,
as
an
alternative,
that
the
apa
gives
us
a
right
to
test
this
question
of
whether
congress
intended
that
the
board
must
be
given
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
these
proposed
settlements.
if
that
argument
is
right,
then
it
would
lead
to,
at
least
in
the
future,
a
review
in
the
district
courts
rather
than
under
10(f),
and
we
certainly
think
for
the
reasons
we
give,
that
a
total
failure
of
an
agency
to
follow
the
procedure
contemplated
in
the
statute
ought
to
lead
to
apa
review
and
that
it's
senseless
to
send
us
back
to
the
district
court--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that's
right.
i
mean,
unless
the
board...
unless
the
government's
position
here
is
that
they
can
do
whatever
they
want,
it
seems
to
me
that
where
we
actually
are
is
that
the
general
counsel
has
the
trump
card.
if
he
enters
into--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that's
what's
a
total
mystery
to
us
and
it
may
be
that
if
you
rule
for
the
board
here,
the
board
will
greatly
regret
having
joined
hands
with
the
general
counsel.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that
is
the
rule
in
the
district
court,
but
our
argument
here
is
that
the
statute
draws
a
different
line.
obviously,
it
could
draw
that
line,--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i'm
saying
that
the
issues
to
be
presented
to
the
tribunal
in
this
kind
of
a
three-party
situation
are
analogous
to
the
issues
on
whether
or
not
to
approve
a
settlement
in
a
normal
district
court
case
brought
by
a
plaintiff
after
answer
in
a
class
action
case
brought
after
the
class
is
certified,
which
is
very
close,
because
that,
too,
is
one
where
you
have
a
representative
rather
than
just
one
party
on
the
plaintiff's
side.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
true,
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
mere
filing
of
a
complaint
is
a
less
painstaking
process
than
in
a
civil
case
than
the
filing
of
a
complaint
by
this
public
agency
after
quite
an
elaborate
system
for
trying
to
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff.
i
want
to
take
advantage
of
the
rest
of
my
time
to
emphasize
the
following
point.
in
1947,
the
general
understanding,
and,
indeed,
while
there
are
quibbles
from
the
board,
we
think
that
the
only
possible
understanding
from
the
written
materials
was
that
the
board
itself
passed
on
settlements,
post-complaint.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
formal
or
informal
or
whatever,
and
that
the
overall
thrust
of
the
1947
amendments
were
to
provide
a
higher
level
of
procedures,
open
procedures,
by
disinterested
decision-makers
and
less
staff
determination
than
had
been
true
prior
to
1947.
we
believe
it
turns
this
statute
absolutely
upside
down
to
say
that
one
piece
of
congress'
effort
to
reach
a
higher
due
process
stage
in
the
adjudication
of
unfair
labor
practice
cases,
namely
the
creation
of
an
independent
general
counsel,
worked
without
anybody
saying
so
to
limit
the
right
of
the
charging
party
to
get
either
an
administrative
law
judge
or,
if
you
go
to
that
point,
the
board's
determination,
a
more
disinterested
determination
on
whether
the
settlement
really
effectuates
the
policies
of
the
act
and
protects
the
interests
of--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--oh,
i
think
they
were,
your
honor,
because
as
the
court
has
remarked
in
other
circumstances,
what
was
sauce
for
the
goose
became
sauce
for
the
gander
because
taft-hartley
for
the
first
time
created
charging
party
rights
in
employers
against
unions,
and
senator
taft
and
his
colleagues
were
very
solicitous
of
the
rights
and
interests
of
that
new
class
of
charging
parties.
certainly,
there
was
nothing
that
anybody
said
or
anything
that
was
indicated
which
would
cut
back
into
that.
the
reason
for
creating
the
general
counsel
was
to
keep
the
board
out
of
something
that
was
considered
not
to
be
a
proper
adjudicatory
function,
namely
the
issuance
of
complaints,
the
determination
to
go
forward,
but
it
is
a
proper
adjudicatory
function
as
we've
indicated
and
has
always
been
understood
to
be
such
for
the
tribunal
before
whom
the
proceeding
is
pending
at
a
certain
stage
to
say
whether
or
not
a
settlement
should
be
accepted.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it's
been
a
mistake
which--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
first
of
all,--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--but
without
judicial
approval.
the
d.c.
circuit
and
the
3rd
circuit
have
said
this
is
wrong
and
the
board
just
has
continued
to
chug
along
as
if
that
hasn't
happened.
so,
the
situation
is
one
because
i
don't
think
there
are
that
many
charging
parties
who
relish
the
proposition
of
challenging
their
champion's
determination,
the
situation
is
one
in
which
there
hasn't
been
sufficient
motive,
but
as
i
say,
before
'47,
what
we're
saying
is
congress'
intent
was
so
far
as
everything
shows
the
practice.
from
'47
to--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no.
10...
i
think
that
practice
was
one
which
the
agency
created
but
which
was
one
which
the
statute
has
always
intended
because
it
seems
to
us
that
section
10(b),
which
has
always
been
there,
contemplates
that
once
the
complaint
issues,
the
matter
will
be
determined
by
the
board.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
guess
the
way
we
view
this
case,
justice
scalia,
that
two
aspects
to
the
judicial
review
question.
aspect
number
1
is
what
did
congress
intend
with
regard
to
the
procedures
within
the
agency,
and
then
question
number
2,
which
we
think
depends
on
the
resolution
of
question
number
1,
is
if
the
agency
doesn't
proceed
in
that
way,
does
the
party
disadvantaged
have
a
right
to
have
a
court
say
that
you
have
followed
an
improper
procedure.
