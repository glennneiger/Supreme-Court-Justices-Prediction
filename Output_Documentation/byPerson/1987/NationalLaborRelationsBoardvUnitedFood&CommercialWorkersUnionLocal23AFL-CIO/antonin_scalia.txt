justice
scalia
that
shows
something
of
the
ambivalence
of
the
whole
scheme,
though,
doesn't
it?
you
said
that
the
board's
regulations
permit
the
regional
director
to
dismiss
the
complaint
before
any
action
is
taken,
yet
you
told
us
earlier
that
the
regional
director
was
not
the
agent
of
the
board
but
the
agent
of
the
general
counsel.
if
that
were
purely
the
case,
one
would
expect
the
general-counsel
to
issue
some
regulations
as
to
what
his
regional
directors
can
do.
justice
scalia
suppose
the
general
counsel
changes
his
mind
after
one
of
these
informal
settlements,
there
hasn't
been
any
violation
of
the
informal
settlement
by
the
party
with
whom
it's
made,
but
the
general
counsel
just
decides
it
was
a
bad
idea,
would
anything
prevent
him
from
going
ahead
to
reinstitute
the
complaint?
justice
scalia
has
it
ever
happened,
to
your
knowledge,
that
without
a
violation
of
the
informal
consent
agreement,
the
general
counsel
just
decides--
justice
scalia
--you
don't
personally
know
that
it's
ever
happened?
justice
scalia
mr.
come,
i
don't
understand
what
you
just
said.
you
said
that
some
informal
complaints
do
require
the
approval
of
the
board?
do
you
still
consider
it
an
informal
complaint
if
it's
entered
after
the
hearing
begins
and
requires
the
approval
of
the
alj
and
also
the
approval
of
the
board?
do
you
still
consider
that
an
informal
settlement?
justice
scalia
why
isn't
the
approval
of
the
board
a
board
order?
that
might
well
be
a
board
order
as
far
as
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
concerned.
justice
scalia
but
you
say
it
just
doesn't
result
in
any
command
by
the
board,
the
violation
of
which
you--
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
why
do
you...
i
didn't...
i
don't
follow
that.
i
thought
that
the
general
counsel
calls
a
formal
settlement
only
something
that
results
in
a
board
order
in
the
sense
of
a
command
to
the
parties,
and
that
he
considers
those
board
orders
that
merely
approve
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint
to
be
not
formal
settlements
but
informal
settlements.
it's
a
question
of
terminology,
but
i
understand
his
use
of
terminology
to
be
as
i
just
described
it.
justice
scalia
he
calls
them
informal
settlements,
i
think.
they
do
not
produce
a
board
order.
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
you
call
those
formal
settlements
and
you
think
he
calls
them
that,
too?
justice
scalia
finally
disposing
of
a
complaint.
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
that.
that's
sort
of
a
middle
ground.
i
can
see
how
10(f)
might
be
read
to
mean
any
order
whatever,
which
would
produce
a
very
strange
result.
you'd
have
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
there's
no
record
below.
so,
you
would
really
want
to
use
the
usual
district
court
review
rather
than
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
one
extreme.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
alternative
to
that
is
regarding
10(f)
as
referring
to
the
order
described
in
10(c),
which
is
very
clear.
it
says
in
10(c)
that
after
a
complaint's
filed,
if,
upon
the
preponderance
of
the
testimony,
the
board
shall
be
of
the
opinion
that
any
person
named
has
engaged
or--
justice
scalia
--is
engaging
in
an
unfair
labor
practice,
the
board
shall
state
its
findings
of
fact
and
shall
issue
and
shall
cause
to
be
served
on
such
person
an
order
in
one
direction
or
the
other.
that's
the
order,
it
seems
to
me,
that
10(f)
refers
to.
and
that
is
not
the
kind
of
order
at
issue
here.
justice
scalia
but
10(c)
only
says
an
order
requiring
such
person
to
cease
and
desist
from
such
unfair
labor
practice.
that's
the
kind
of
order
it's
referring
to.
justice
scalia
the
whole
section
it
entitled
prevention
of
unfair
labor
practices.
it
sets
forth
the
whole
structure.
in
(c)
it
says
what
kind
of
an
order
the
board
shall
issue
and
then
in
(f)
it
says
any
person
aggrieved
by
an
order
of
the
board.
it
seems
to
me
it's
obviously
referring
to
the
same
order
that's
described
in
(c).
justice
scalia
it
may
be
reviewable
but
not
under
10(f).
justice
scalia
if
it's
reviewable,
it
would
be
under
the
apa,
which
means
it
would
go
into
district
court,
which
is
where
it
should
be
if
there
hasn't
been
any
formal
proceeding.
you
need
a
record
to
be
made.
justice
scalia
mr.
gold,
that
practice
was
a
board-created
practice.
justice
scalia
and
what
you're
arguing
here
is
that
somehow
congress
intended
to
freeze
that
practice
and
the
only
thing
you
can
point
to
as
being
a
freezing
of
that
practice
is
10(f),
right?
justice
scalia
but
what
i'm
saying
is
if
i
don't
read
10(f)
as
applying
to
this
kind
of
an
order,
the
only
thing
that
applies
to
this
order
is
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
there's
no
intent
there
to
freeze
the
agency
into
a
particular
administrative
scheme
that
existed
in
1947.
justice
scalia
just
to
settle
terminology,
do
you
consider
that
a
formal
settlement
or
an
informal
settlement,
where
all
the
board
approves
is
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint,
no
order
from
the
board?
justice
scalia
your
time--
