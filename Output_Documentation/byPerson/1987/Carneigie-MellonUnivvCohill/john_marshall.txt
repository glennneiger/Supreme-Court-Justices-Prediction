justice
john
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
third
circuit.
here
we
hold
that
a
federal
district
court
has
discretion
under
the
doctrine
of
pendant
jurisdiction
to
remand
and
remove
the
case
to
a
state
court
when
all
federal-law
claims
in
the
action
have
been
eliminated
and
only
state
law
claims
remain.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
order
of
the
third
circuit
denying
petitioners'
application
for
a
writ
of
mandamus.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
