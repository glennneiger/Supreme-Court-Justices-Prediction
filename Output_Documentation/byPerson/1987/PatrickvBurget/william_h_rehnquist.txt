we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
86-1145,
timothy
a.
patrick
versus
william
m.
burget.
mr.
lyon,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lyon.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
triplett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
mr.
triplett,
even
if
he
had
resigned
his
privileges
at
the
hospital,
if
he
got
adverse
peer
review
recommendations,
wouldn't
that
lead
the
state
examining
board
to
inquire
into
his
competency
to
continue
to
practice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
they
wouldn't
act
on
the
report
that
was
sent
to
them
by
the
peer
review
committee
to
look
into
his
fitness
to
continue
practicing?
i
thought
you
certainly
would.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
a
particular
statute
or
just
your
right
to
sue
anybody?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
one,
is
that
statute
in
so
many
words
authorize
judicial
review?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i'm
just
asking
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
authorizes
it
in
so
many
words.
there
shouldn't
be
two
different
views
of
the
answer
to
that
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
triplett.
mr.
lyon,
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lyon,
what
is
the
point
then
of
the
requirement
in
the
statute
that
the
hospital
report
disciplinary
actions
to
the
state
medical
examiner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
view
of
that,
the
fact
that
your
client
had
resigned
from
the
hospital
facilities
wouldn't
have
prevented
the
state
medical
board
from
going
ahead
to
look
into
his
fitness
to
practice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
page
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lyon.
the
case
is
submitted.
