mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
oregon,
like
many
states,
in
the
mid-70s
was
faced
with
a
malpractice
crisis.
the
cost
of
insurance
premiums
for
doctors
was
spiraling,
the
loss
of
doctors
from
practicing
because
of
the
lack
of
coverage
was
increasing,
and
indeed,
the
human
tragedy
visited
by
malpractice
was
evident
to
all.
the
state
of
oregon
recognized
that
it
had
to
address
this
malpractice
crisis
in
a
multifaceted
way.
it
first
armed
the
governing
board
of
the
hospitals
of
each
private
hospital
with
a
substantial
degree
of
direction
and
authority.
they
were
compelled
not
to
simply
accept
a
doctor
because
they
had
a
license
to
practice
in
the
state,
but
rather
to
make
a
more
discriminating
choice
of
whether
they
had
the
skill
and
training
to
receive
credentialing
in
the
specific
areas
in
which
they
sought
to
practice.
they
were
compelled
to
establish
standards
for
the
review
of
doctors
by
doctors.
and
indeed
they
were
compelled
to
put
doctors
together
in
a
group
of
peer
review
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
morbidity
mortality
and
to
improve
patient
care.
they
took
another
step
during
the
70s.
the
board
of
medical
examiners
was
armed
with
substantial
authority.
one
of
the
key
portions
of
that
authority
was
that
its
proceedings
would
be
absolutely
and
totally
confidential.
the
wisdom
of
that
choice
was
demonstrated
in
this
record.
the
number
of
complainants
before
the
board
of
medical
examiners
rose
from
300
to
1500
per
year
once
this
confidentiality
provision
was
written.
they
granted
immunity
to
complainants.
they
went
further.
they
compelled
doctors
to
report
on
other
doctors.
they
didn't
say
report
in
the
event
a
doctor
is
not
good.
they
stated
report
in
the
event
that
he
is
or
may
not
be
competent
to
practice.
they
compelled
hospitals
to
report
in
the
same
sort
of
way.
they
established
procedures
for
reexamination
of
doctors
who
were
accused
of
practicing
inappropriately.
they
compelled
medical
malpractice
insurers
to
report
every
single
claim
against
a
doctor
to
the
board
of
medical
examiners.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
the
net
effect
of
that
policy
would
be
to
reduce
those
doctors
who
ought
not
continue
to
practice.
so
the
net
effect
is
that
indeed
marketplace
access
was
being
limited
or
correspondingly,
the
door
out
was
being
opened.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
the
state
did
direct
hospitals
to
cause
doctors
to
review
doctors
at
the
hospital
level.
the
net
effect
of
doctors
reviewing
doctors
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
they
retained
their
privileges
within
a
hospital
would
inexorably
be
the
exclusion
of
doctors
from
the
privilege
to
practice.
that
has,
as
a
by-product--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--that's
right,
because
of
their
incompetence.
but
you
have
to
realize
that
for
years,
doctors
were
accused
of
the
conspiracy
of
silence.
no
one
reported
on
another
doctor.
it
was
an
old
boy
school,
if
you
will.
this
system
compelling
competitors
to
report
on
competitors,
compelling
competitors
to
judge
competitors,
was
an
express
statement
of
the
oregon
legislature
that
we
must
get
on
with
excluding
doctors
from
practice
who
are
incompetent.
that
the
marketplace
dynamics
of
what
do
you
charge
simply
don't
work.
this
is
not
the
sale
of
an
apple.
it
is
the
sale
of
a
service
where
the
patient
doesn't
know
what
they're
getting.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
all
doctors
who
are
members
of
the
medical--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--no.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
they
do
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
there
are
a
number
of--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--that
is
correct.
they
have
to
be
credentialed.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
the
doctors
who
are
not
part
of
a
medical
staff
are
subject
to
the
ongoing
review
of
the
board
of
medical
examiners,
and
upon
complaint
by
a
private
citizen,
complaint
of
a
fellow
practitioner,
or
any
other
person,
they
will
then
inspect
the
practice
of
that
doctor
to
determine
whether
he
or
she
should
continue
to
practice
medicine
in
the
state
of
oregon.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
the
hospital
has
the
responsibility
if
there
is
an
adverse
determination
in
peer
review
to
report
that
to
the
board
of
medical
examiners.
the
board
of
medical
examiners
under
the
statute
has
now
received
the
report
of
substandard
care
and
under
the
oregon
laws,
they
are
obligated
to
look
into
that
matter.
they
have
an
investigative
staff,
a
full
time
staff
of
18
people
to
go
and
look
and
see
what
the
problem
is
and
to
determine
whether
further
action
is
required,
such
as
depriving
that
doctor
of
the
right
to
practice
in
the
state
of
oregon.
or
they
can
also
make
a
determination--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--excuse
me?
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
no,
because
dr.
patrick
resigned
before
any
decision
was
made
by
the
hearing
committee
of
the
hospital.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
he
resigned
privileges
from
the
hospital.
he
left
the
hospital
prior
to
the
time
that
the
administrative
committee
of
the
hospital
had
made
a
decision.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
two
thousand...
twenty-five
hundred.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
over
a
period
of
approximately
ten
years.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
there
was
no
report
that
i
am
aware
of
made
subsequent
to
his
resignation
from
the
hospital
to
the
board
of
medical
examiners
that
would
then
invoke
their
authority.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
let
me
explain.
the
oregon
statute
provides
that
once
the
hospital
has
made
a
final
determination
with
respect
to
the
privileges
or
credentials
of
a
doctor
and
those
determinations
are
adverse,
they
are
compelled
to
forward
those
to
the
board
of
medical
examiners
for
their
review.
if
a
doctor
goes
through
peer
review
and
indeed
he
is
found
to
be
a
satisfactory
doctor,
no
report
goes
to
the
board
that
he's
satisfactory.
the
process
requires
a
final
resolution
by
the
hospital.
we
in
this
case
urge
that
indeed
the
duty
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
applied
and
that
dr.
patrick
should
have
been
required
to
complete
the
hearing
process
before
his
peers.
if
he
was
unsatisfied
with
that,
to
proceed
to
the
board
of
directors
of
the
hospital
who
under
the
peer
review
process
set
forth
in
the
by-laws
would
have
an
independent
look,
not
merely
at
the
question
of
the
facts
but
of
the
procedure
followed.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
he
ought
not
to.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
your
honor,
in
this
case,
the
decision
to
bring
him
to
a
hearing
was
made
in
march
of
1981
by
the
executive
committee
of
the
hospital.
fourteen
days
later,
this
lawsuit
was
filed.
the
process
of
the
ad
hoc
hearing
before
the
hospital
didn't
commence
until
six
months
later.
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
asserted
that
at
least
one
of
the
defendants
had
previously
engaged
in
misconduct
by
reporting
to
the
board
of
medical
examiners.
now,
i
put
it
to
you
in
the
context
of
having
been
sued
and
accused
of
impropriety
in
reporting
to
the
board,
do
you
exacerbate
the
circumstance.
i
think
what
happened
here--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--i
can
report
to
you
that
with
respect
to
the
snodgrass
incident
which
is
the
one
that
triggered
the
hospital
peer
review,
that
that
was
reported.
i
can
also
advise
you
that
when
the
board
of
medical
examiners
reviewed
dr.
patrick's
practice
in
1980,
and
announced
a
decision
in
regard
to
it
just
one
year
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
hospital-based
review
of
both
prior
and
subsequent
events
to
the
board
of
medical
examiners,
that
they
reviewed
his
entire
practice,
issued
a
formal
reprimand
with
respect
to
abandonment
of
a
patient,
which
dr.
patrick
acknowledged
was
fair.
he
disagreed
with
their
opinion
as
to
how
he
had
handled
other
cases
which
involved
essentially
misdiagnoses,
or
cases
in
which
wisdom
would
have
suggested
that
the
patient
be
sent
to
a
tertiary
care
hospital,
a
hospital
that
had
the
capability
of
handling
that
patient's
problems.
this
hospital
unfortunately
had
no
pathologist
on
staff,
had
no
radiologist
that
was
there
on
a
permanent
basis,
had
only
an
anesthetist,
and
yet
some
of
the
most
exotic
vascular
and
thoracic
surgery
was
being
performed
by
this
doctor
in
that
hospital.
many
people
described
him
as
a
marvelous
physician
from
the
elbows
down.
and
that
his
problem
indeed
was
judgmental
and
ego.
that
he
ought
not
to
have
been
performing
these
procedures
in
this
rural
community.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
there's
no
question
that
that's
how
the
jury
saw
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
i
know
the
court
has
debated
whether
the
issue
here
is
exemption
or
preemption.
i
won't
engage
in
that
colloquy.
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
two
of
the
court's
most
recent
decisions,
that
they
come
closer
to
the
mark.
in
town
of
hallie,
there
was
no
direct
statement
in
the
enabling
legislation
by
the
state
that
the
town
of
hallie
should
engage
in
a
tie-in
arrangement
in
which
it
would
predicate
the
availability
of
its
solid
waste
disposal
system
upon
those
in
an
unannexed
area
using
their
garbage
haulers.
there
was
no
indication
that
the
state
directly
intended
the
restraint
that
was
imposed.
i
think
that
what
the
court
said
there
is,
if
it
is
reasonably
foreseeable
that
an
anticompetitive
restraint
will
arise,
that
is
sufficient.
and
i
think
as
well,
when
you
look
at
what
happened
in
southern
motor
freight,
there
a
group
of--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
for
good,
bad
or
indifferent
reasons.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
my
analysis
of
the
oregon
statute
which
is
a
statute
that
addresses
the
question
of
immunity,
not
the
question
of
the
evidentiary
privilege,
and
there
is
no
exception
in
oregon
with
respect
to
whether
you
are
entitled
to
the
type
of
information
that
was
obtained
here.
that
view
with
respect
to
the
immunity
in
good
faith.
good
faith
i
presume
means
not
arbitrary
or
capricious,
means
that
you
have
substantial
evidence
for
what
you
have
done,
which
is
the
equivalent
of...
is
the
opposite
side
of
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
well,
i'm
not
so
sure.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
my
view
of
the
language
of
the
oregon
statute
is
this.
it
is
sending
a
clear
signal
that
the
state
through
its
state
process
will
remedy,
will
supervise
and
remedy
the
peer
review
process
in
the
event
any
participant
steps
out
of
line.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
well,
there
are
a
host
of
remedies.
i
categorically
disagree
with
counsel
that
there
a
not
an
absolute
right
to
review
of
a
hospital-based
decision.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
the
state
court
can
direct.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
if
he
asks
for
judicial
review
of
the
decision.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
yes.
no,
distinctly
not.
section
41.675(5)
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
along
with
the
legislative
history
that
relates
to
it.
and
that
section
was
enacted
in
order
to
clarify
the
type
of
evidence
that
a
doctor
would
have
available
in
the
event
he
sought
judicial
review
of
loss
of
privileges.
and
so
we
cite
the
court
to
that
statute.
secondly,
there
are
other
remedies--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--that
is
my
view
of
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
the
reason
that
there
has
been
fuzziness
about
is
there
judicial
review
is
that
in
the
straube
case,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
said,
we
need
not
decide
whether
there
is
a
right
of
review.
and
then
in
their
footnote,
they
then
proceeded
on
to
review
on
the
basis
of
was
there
due
process
and
was
there
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
conclusion.
in
a
footnote
right
where
they
said
we
need
not
decide
this
issue,
they
quote
the
new
statute
which
is
the
statute
which
imposed
upon
hospitals
the
obligation
to
have
fair
proceedings
for
review
of
doctors.
and
so
i
believe
it
is
very
clear
that
there
is
a
right
of
judicial
review
of
peer
review
decisions.
secondly,--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--well,
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
the
definition
of
active
versus
passive
is.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
how
do
you
establish
a
structure
for
review?
that's
a
very
difficult
problem.
to
what
extent
do
we
say
to
the
oregon
legislature,
establish
a
massive
mechanism.
why
not
leave
it
to
the
courts
to
determine
if
fair
process
has
been
followed?
now
that
indeed
is
the
issue
here.
our
people
are
accused
of
engaging
in
misconduct
during
the
peer
review
process.
the
court
of
oregon
is
perfectly
capable
of
supervising
that,
giving
the
sort
of
check
that
hallie
seems
to
say
is
appropriate.
i
view
the
second
component
as
evidentiary.
i
think
that's
what
hallie
says.
it
is
a
double
check
on
whether
you
are
conforming
with
state
law.
and
if
in
the
supervision,
they
find
that
someone
is
not
complying--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--no.
the
hospital
has,
and
it's
in
evidence,--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--it
says
you
shall
have
one
that
is
written
and
that--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--no.
but
then
what
happens--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--in
the
by-laws,
the
answer
is,
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
by-laws
of
the
hospital.
and
the
by-laws
of
the
hospital
are
subject
to
review
by
the
health
division
of
the
state
of
oregon.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
yes.
the
statute
is
very
clear
that
the
health
division
of
the
state
of
oregon
has
total
authority
over
hospitals
within
the
state.
they
are
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
auditing
compliance
with
their
rules.
they
are
a
receiver
of--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--they
have
granted
authority
to
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--they
have
adopted
rules
where
a
complaint
has
been
filed
by
any
person
who
believes
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
health
rules,
which
includes
the
entire
peer
review
section
that
apply
to
hospitals,
which
grants
to
them
total
access
to
all
hospital
records
to
determine
whether
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
there
is
also
a
provision
that
they
shall
use
the
rules
of
the
joint
commission
on
hospital
accreditation
or
they
adopt
their
own
and
they
are
subject
to
review
by
the
state
of
oregon
health
division
for
conformance
with
the
state
law.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
the
statute
says
that
in
event
of
a
violation
of
any
health
statute,
that
the
division
will
report
that
to
the
district
attorney
and
obtain
an
injunction
against
continued
or
perpetuation
of
that
practice.
so
i
think
the
answer
is,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
of
an
interface
between
the
board
and
the
problems
of
dr.
patrick
are
that
it
did--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--we
weren't
dealing
with
any
one
else
in
this
case,
so
i
can't
answer
that.
but
with
respect
to
dr.
patrick
it
did
in
one
instance
involving
the
partridge
case
refer
that
to
a
county
medical
society
for
review
retaining
supervisory
authority
over
it
to
determine
whether
indeed
further
action
was
required
to
be
taken.
they
did,
when
we
reported
a
limitation
as
applies
to
dr.
patrick
when
he
was
put
on
probation
because
of
thoracic
problem
and
put
on
probation
for
six
months.
we
reported
that.
they
wrote
back
and
said
we're
watching,
we
want
to
know
what
the
outcome
of
that
is.
and
so
there
is
an
interface
that
is
taking
place
because
of
the
reporting
requirements.
and
their
duties
as
the
board
of
medical
examiners
to
monitor
all
medical
practitioners
within
the
state.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
all
right.
after
the
committee
completes
its
review,
it
makes
a
recommendation.
that
recommendation
is
to
the
executive
committee
of
the
hospital.
and
it
can
recommend
any
one
of
a
number
of
things.
loss
of
specific
credentials,
loss
of
the
right
to
practice
in
the
hospital,
a
corrective
program
of
education.
it
makes
its
recommendation
to
the
executive
committee.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
then
the
executive
committee,
if
it
concurs
in
the
recommendation,
then
passes
it
on
to
the
governing
board
of
the
hospital,
18
people,
16
of
the
18--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--not
being
doctors.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
they
then
will
hear
the
case
both
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
procedural
due
process--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--what
next
is
if
discipline
is
issued,
it
is
then
reported
to
the
board
of
medical
examiners.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
you
have
either
the
right
to
have
a
court
review
under
os.41.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
i'm
just
saying.
you
either
have
the
right
of
a
review
by
a
court
which
is
contemplated
under--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--administrative
review
that
is
available
is
that
when
the
board
of
medical
examiners
receives
the
report,
they
are
obligated
to
investigate
the
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
they
can
take
further
action.
but
i
think
it
is
contemplated
that
the
action
that
they
would
take
is
to
determine
whether
the
license
should
be
retained.
at
the
same
time,
dr.
patrick,
if
he
believed
that
the
process
was
inappropriate,
had
the
right
to
file
his
own
complaint
with
the
board
of
medical
examiners,
assert
that
my
clients
had
engaged
in
unprincipled
activities,
and
they
would
then
review
his
complaint.
and
if
they
concurred,
i'm
sure
that
the
hospital's
decision
would
be
reversed.
thank
you.
