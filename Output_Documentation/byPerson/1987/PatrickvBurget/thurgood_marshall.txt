mr.
lyon,
what
supervision
does
the
state
of
oregon
maintain
over
this
group,
the
peer
group?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
any
rule
about
it,
state
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
your
position
that
they
just
turn
it
over
to
the
peer
committee
and
forget
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
state
created
body?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
state-created
body
by
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
or
without
the
approval
of
the
state--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--did
the
state
create
it?
is
the
peer
group
created
by
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
interested
in
your
views.
i'm
interested
in
facts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
state
has
no
regard
to
that
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
state
supervise
the
hospital?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
wouldn't
that
give
them
authority
over
the
peer
committee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
worries
me,
that
the
state
does
have
supervision.
convince
me
that
it's
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
apply
to
all
doctors
or
just
surgeons?
do
all
doctors--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--normally
do
all
doctors
have
to
have
hospital
contacts
in
order
to
practice.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
surgeons
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
shouldn't
we
make
a
difference
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
counsel,
after
the
final
action
is
taken
by
the
review
committee,
what
are
the
steps
that
would
mean
administrative
review,
specific,
if
you
please?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
next?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
next?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
next?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
appeals
from
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i've
never
understood
a
court
review
to
be
an
administrative
review.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
administrative
review?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
all
that
decided
by
the
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
business
is
it
of
ours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
third
case,
patrick
versus
burget
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
we
hold
that
the
state
action
doctrine
does
not
protect
positions
in
the
state
or
on
the
ground
from
federal
antitrust
liability
for
the
activities
or
fee
service
of
peer-review-committees.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
believe
it
or
not,
this
one
is
otherwise
unanimous.
