was
it
the
state
policy
to
reduce
the
number
of
doctors
practicing
in
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
all
that
you've
described
shows
that
there's
been
state
action,
but
as
i
understood
the
state
action
defense
in
antitrust
law,
it
was
that
this
particular
result
which
the
federal
antitrust
law
declares
to
be
unlawful,
if
that
result
is
declared
to
be
lawful
by
the
state,
then
it's
all
right.
so
if
the
federal
antitrust
law
would
forbid
price
fixing
but
the
state
says,
we
want
price
fixing,
then
the
federal
government
would
leave
it
alone.
now,
the
trouble
with
all
you've
said
is
i
don't
see
how
this
shows
any
state
policy
that
would
allow
doctors
to
monopolize
the
practice.
if
the
state
said,
we
want
doctors
to
be
able
to
exclude,
there
are
too
many
doctors
in
the
area,
then
i'd
agree
that
there
was
a
state
action
defense.

because
of
their
incompetency.
because
of
their
incompetency,
not
because
of
their
competitiveness.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
had
a
jury
trial
about
that.
i
gather
the
jury
apparently
who
heard
all
of
this
pretty
much
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
doctor
and
that
the
reason
he
had
been
excluded
was
because
of
the
anticompetitive
behavior
of
his
peers
and
not
because
of
his
inabilities.
to
the
extent
that
that's
a
question
that's
still
at
issue
in
this
lawsuit,
i
presume
that's
how
that
jury
saw
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that
the
state
action
claim
you're
making
goes
beyond
what
our
cases
have
held.
can
you
give
us
another
state
action
case
where
we
have
not
said
that
the
state
approves
the
result
with
the
federal
law
determines
to
be
unlawful,
that
is,
in
parker
v.
brown,
the
federal
law
says
no
price
fixing;
the
state
says
we
want
price
fixing.
now,
this
is
not
that
case.
the
federal
law
says
no
anticompetitive
exclusion
of
doctors.
the
state
here
hasn't
said
we
want
anticompetitive
exclusion
of
doctors.
your
argument
is
a
little
different.
it's
sort
of
a
federal
preemption
argument
in
reverse.
that
is,
if
we
apply
the
antitrust
laws,
we
will
be
impinging
upon
the
state
policy
of
assuring
competent
doctors.
now,
maybe
that's
a
good
argument,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
other
case
where
we
have
used
that
preemption
in
reverse
so
to
speak.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
go
on,
would
you
use
the
same
language
here?
it's
reasonably
foreseeable
because
of
this
law
that
doctors
would
exclude
a
competitor?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
reasons
done
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
reasonably
foreseeable.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
think
you
can
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
be
acting
in
entirely
good
faith.
we
reverse
federal
agencies
all
the
time
for
action
that's
arbitrary
and
capricious.
i
don't
think
we're
saying
that
the
action
was
in
bad
faith.
if
it's
bad
faith,
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious
but
vice
versa
is
not
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
needs
something
more
than
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
you're
exaggerating
the
state
law
in
the
same
manner
that
your
opponent
is,
that
is
to
say,
there
isn't
a
state
statute
that
says
you're
liable
for
damages
if
you
act
in
bad
faith,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
one
that
says
you're
not
liable
for
damages
if
you
act
in
good
faith.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
same
kind
of
inference
he's
trying
to
draw.
it's
rather
curious
that
you
should
fight
fire
with
fire.
