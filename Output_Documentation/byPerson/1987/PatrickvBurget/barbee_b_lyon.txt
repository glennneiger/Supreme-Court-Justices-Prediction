mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
this
court
today
is
whether
the
state
of
oregon
has
authorized
these
defendants
to
monopolize
a
part
of
the
practice
of
medicine
in
the
relevant
market
and
whether
it
has
actively
supervised
their
doing
so.
this
was
an
action
for
treble
damages
under
the
sherman
act,
sections
1
and
2.
plaintiff
is
a
physician,
a
surgeon
in
astoria.
the
defendants
also
are
physicians.
there
was
an
economic
rivalry
between
plaintiff
and
defendants
that
went
back
for
ten
years
before
the
events
in
this
case.
the
defendants
are
associated
with
the
clinic
known
as
the
astoria
clinic.
they
have
associated
with
them
three-fourths
of
the
physicians
in
the
relevant
market.
there
is
one
hospital
in
the
relevant
market.
dr.
patrick
is
a
surgeon,
and
if
you
are
a
surgeon,
you
must
have
access
to
a
hospital
in
order
to
practice
that
branch
of
medicine.
dr.
patrick
lost
his
privileges
at
the
hospital
and
he
alleged
that
he
was
deprived
of
those
privileges
by
defendants
using
their
power,
their
dominant
power
over
the
hospital,
on
the
staff
of
the
hospital,
and
over
the
committees
of
the
hospital.
he
alleged
that
they
did
so
for
an
anticompetitive
motive,
and
that
it
was
anticompetitive
conduct.
that
they
did
not
do
so
for
medical,
ethical
or
professional
reasons.
the
jury
agreed
with
him
after
a
three-week
trial
and
awarded
treble
damages.
the
trial
judge
upheld
the
verdict
and
entered
judgment
accordingly.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
reversed.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
although
there
was
sufficient
evidence
of
the
defendants'
anticompetitive
motive
and
sufficient
evidence
of
their
conduct,
nevertheless
what
they
did,
unprofessional
as
it
might
have
been,
was
immunized
from
antitrust
laws
by
reason
of
the
state
action
doctrine.
did
the
state
action
doctrine
protect
and
defend
what
they
did?
the
state
action
doctrine,
as
announced
by
this
court,
has
as
its
principles,
its
purpose,
the
resolution
of
principles
of
federalism
on
the
one
side
with
state
law
on
the
other.
it
draws
a
balance
between
the
federal
antitrust
laws
and
state
policies
which
may
be
anticompetitive.
as
announced
by
this
court,
there
are
two
branches
to
the
state
action
doctrine,
two
tests.
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
challenged
restraint
is
one
which
is
clearly
articulated
by
the
state
and
affirmatively
expressed
as
a
state
policy.
the
second
branch
of
the
test
is
whether
or
not
it
is
actively
supervised
by
the
state
itself.
turning
to
the
second
of
these
first,
was
this
conduct
of
defendants'
actively
supervised
by
the
state
of
oregon?
the
defendants,
the
hospital,
its
staff
and
committees
are
all
private
parties.
they
are
not
agencies
of
the
state
of
oregon.
they
are
not
subject
to
the
state
administrative
procedure
act.
there
is
no
state
statute
providing
any
state
agency
which
reviews
what
they
do,
authorizes
any
state
agency
to
reverse
what
they
do.
there
is
no
state
statute
giving
a
right
of
appeal
to
any
particular
court
under
any
form
of
procedure.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
certainly
no
clear
review.
there
have
been
only
two
cases
in
which
the
state
of
oregon
supreme
court
considered
whether
or
not
it
had
such
power.
in
both
cases,
it
expressly
said
that
it
did
not
decide
whether
it
had
the
power
or
not.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
perhaps
that
power
might
exist.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
that
is.
that
is
a
private
tort
action
remedy
that
is
available
under
state
law.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
that
was
pursued.
that
was
our
state
law
count
that
was
tried
in
this
particular
case,
and
we
want
a
verdict
on
that
with
punitive
damages.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
your
honor,
this
court
has
never
so
held.
it
would
strike
me
as
anomalous
to
say
that
because
private
conduct,
because
a
state
provides
a
forum
in
which
litigants
can
sue
each
other
and
redress
their
private
grievances,
that
doesn't
amount
to
state
action.
for
example,
the
state
provides
a
forum
for
people
who
have
a
dispute
over
a
breach
of
contract
or
a
tort.
that
does
not
mean
the
state
is
actively
supervised
in
what
they
do.
the
standard
that
this
court
has
announced
is
whether
there
is
a
pointed
reexamination
of
what
goes
on
in
the
challenged
restraint
to
see
that
it
does
not
unnecessarily
interfere
with
the
policies
of
the
antitrust
laws.
this
court
has
never
held
that
judicial
review
of
this
type
is
that
kind
of
pointed
reexamination
of
the
anticompetitive
conduct.
and
least
of
all,
i
should
suggest,
should
the
court
announce
that
as
a
principle
for
the
first
time
in
a
case
where
the
state
supreme
court
does
not
even
know
whether
it
has
jurisdiction
to
consider
these
kinds
of
issues.
when
dr.
patrick
was
confronted
with
what
was
being
done
to
him
in
astoria,
there
was
really
nothing
he
could
do.
the
one
thing
that
occurred
to
him
to
do
was
to
at
least
ask
the
hospital
to
appoint
a
neutral
panel
to
consider
the
charges
that
were
made
against
him.
he
offered
to
submit
to
whatever
decision
the
panel
and
the
hospital
would
make
if
they
would
only
appoint
a
neutral
panel.
he
said
if
they
only
would
do
that,
that
would
avoid
a
lot
of
controversy
and
a
lot
of
expense.
he
renewed
that
request
twice.
it
was
denied.
there
was
no
place
else
to
turn
to
and
this
is
how
this
case
arose.
the
court
of
appeals
purported
to
find
active
supervision
in
three
ways.
first
of
all,
the
results
of
a
peer
review
decision
in
a
state
hospital
are
to
be
reported
to
the
board
of
medical
examiners
which
is
the
state
licensing
authority
for
physicians.
yet,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute,
and
counsel
concedes,
i
understand,
that
the
state
board
of
medical
examiners
has
no
power
to
reverse
or
interfere
with
any
decision
made
by
the
state
board
of
medical
examiners.
it
can
only
make
decisions
about
the
medical
license
to
practice
medicine
in
the
state
of
oregon.
next,
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
adequate
state
supervision
because
the
state
health
division
licenses
hospitals.
and
there
is
a
statute
that
requires
the
trustees
or
the
governing
body
of
a
hospital
to
see
to
it
that
there
are
procedures
in
place
for
peer
review.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
because
the
health
division
had
the
authority
to
see
that
the
governing
body
adopted
procedures,
that
amounted
to
state
supervision.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
state
health
division
has
ever
intervened
in
this
case
in
any
way.
there's
no
evidence
that
it's
ever
intervened
in
any
peer
review
proceeding
in
any
way.
there
are
no
reported
decisions
of
any
case
in
which
it
has
ever
intervened.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
i
maintain
none
at
all,
your
honor.
none
at
all.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
i
say
there
isn't,
your
honor.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
no
rules
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
that's
true,
your
honor.
as
far
as
administering
it.
what
the
state
does,
however,
there
is
another
statute
that
says
that
the
people
who
participate
in
peer
review
are
immune
from
liability
for
whatever
they
do
in
peer
review,
provided
they
act
in
good
faith.
i
contend
that
by
the
inclusion
of
that,
the
state
contemplates
the
possibility
that
defendants
might
abuse
this
position,
might
abuse
the
peer
review
procedures
for
their
own
motive,
and
therefore
it
leaves
to
the
person
who
is
the
victim
of
that,
the
right
to
sue
for
damages
for
the
peoples'
bad
faith.
that
is
the
remedy.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
the
peer
review
committee
is,
your
honor--
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
--the
peer
review
committees
are
not
creatures
of
statute.
the
statute
requires
hospitals
to
see
it
that
the
physicians
are
organized
in
a
way
that
they
review
each
other's
procedures.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
the
state
does
not
intervene
in
the
appointment
of
these
committees
in
any
way.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it
is,
because
the
hospital
creates
them.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
it
is
the
hospital
that
creates
the
peer
review
committees,
your
honor.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
it
has
no
authority
to
mandate--
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
--the
state
health
division
has
supervisory
authority
over
the
hospital.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
because
all
that
the
state
statute
gives
the
health
division
the
power
to
do
is
to
see
to
it
to
assure
that
the
trustees
have
adopted
procedures
for
peer
review.
it
does
not
give
them
the
power
to
engage
in
what
this
court
has
referred
to
previously
as
appointed
reexamination
of
what
goes
on
in
peer
review
applying
the
rules
to
a
particular
case.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
there's
been
no
reported
case,
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
any
agency
of
the
state
ever
did
anything,
there's
no
reported
case
in
which
any
state
agency
has
ever
intervened
in
any
way
in
any
peer
review
decision
in
any
matter
in
the
state
of
oregon.
the
first
branch
of
the
state
action
doctrine
is
that
the
challenged
restraint
must
be
one
which
is
clearly
articulated
and
affirmatively
expressed
as
state
policy.
the
court
of
appeals
declared
that
in
this
case
this
particular
conduct
was
indeed
clearly
authorized
by
state
policy.
by
that,
the
court
of
appeals
was
referring
to
the
statute
which
required
hospitals
to
have
peer
review
procedures
in
place.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
indicates
that
the
state
of
oregon
ever
intended
these
physicians
or
any
other
physicians
to
monopolize
any
branch
of
the
practice
of
medicine
within
the
state
of
oregon.
the
only
purpose
stated
for
this
statute
was
to
improve
patient
care,
to
reduce
mortality,
to
promote
patient
welfare.
it
does
not
follow
that
because
the
state
requires
peer
review
for
the
purpose
of
patient
care,
that
authorizes
people
to
abuse
that
procedure
for
their
own
anticompetitive
purposes.
that
is
the
mistake
that
the
court
of
appeals
made.
you
can
tell
that
from
the
statute
itself,
from
the
articulated
purposes,
and
second
of
all,
you
can
tell
that
from
the
fact
that
the
state
itself
contemplated,
as
i
said,
that
this
power
might
be
abused
and
it
left
the
defendants,
those
who
did
abuse
it,
to
the
liability
that
they
would
encounter
in
an
action
for
damages
such
as
this
or
one
under
state
procedure.
the
irony
of
this
case
is
that
if
this
sort
of
behavior
is
allowed
to
take
place
under
the
guise
of
the
state
action
doctrine
under
the
state
action
immunities,
it
will
lead
to
exactly
the
opposite
result
of
that
which
the
state
contemplated.
if
the
more
powerful
cannot
compete
by
being
good,
then
they
can
drive
out
those
who
are
better
and
yet
do
not
have
the
power
to
resist
the
influence
in
this
particular
case.
there
was
testimony
in
this
case
that
dr.
patrick
was
the
better
surgeon
in
astoria.
he
is
the
one
who
is
now
deprived
of
practice.
the
weaker,
the
less
competent
is
the
one
who
has
succeeded
and
the
practice
of
medicine
has
declined.
that
is
not
state
policy;
that
is
contrary
to
state
policy
and
is
not
one
that
this
court
should
declare--
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
--well,
certainly
not
each
decision
has
to
be
reviewed.
obviously
the
vast
majority
of
these
decisions
will
never
be
challenged.
but
i
submit
that
there
needs
to
be
some
sort
of
procedure
in
place,
whether
it
is
judicial,
administrative,
or
otherwise,
by
which--
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
--yes,
i
did,
your
honor.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think--
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
because
unless
there
is
a
procedure
in
a
case
whereby
the
particular
result
in
a
particular
case
can
be
challenged,
can
be
reviewed
by
the
state
to
see
that
the
state
policy
is
being
carried
out,
the
state
policy
of
bettering
patient
care,
of
reducing
mortality,
then
without
a
system
in
place
for
permitting
that,
then
there
is
no
way
for
the...
as
this
court
said...
the
pointed
reexamination
of
each
case,
of
the
events
that
go
on
to
take
place.
i
don't
recall
all
of
the
details
of
the
ama
proposals,
but
i
do
not
believe
they
provided
for
that.
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
the
evidence
that
was
admitted
with
respect
to
the
activities
of
one
of
the
defendants,
dr.
russell,
who
was
a
member
of
the
board
of
medical
examiners,
that
his
conduct
also
was
state
action,
and
that
invalidated
the
verdict
in
this
particular
case.
we
challenge
that
particular
holding
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
we
did
not
sue
the
state
board
of
medical
examiners
in
this
case.
we
sued
them
previously
for
violations
of
the
civil
rights
laws,
and
for
violation
of
the
oregon
administrative
procedures
act,
but
that
case
was
over.
this
was
an
action
for
treble
damages
for
dr.
patrick's
loss
of
his
hospital
privileges
and
the
destruction
of
his
practice
in
oregon.
the
particular
defendant
in
question,
the
evidence
of
what
happened
before
the
board
of
medical
examiners
was
part
of
something
that
had
begun
years
before,
continued
through
that
proceeding,
and
continued
after.
it
was
evidentiary.
it
displayed
the
entire
course
of
conduct
and
was
admissible
for
that
purpose,
and
for
no
other.
we
did
not
seek
damages.
the
damages
that
we
sought
were
for
injury
to
his
business
and
property,
which
derived
from
the
loss
of
his
hospital
privileges
afterwards.
dr.
russell
furthermore
had
disqualified
himself
at
the
beginning
of
the
proceedings
and
under
oregon
law,
he
was
therefore
entirely
without
authority
to
act
in
any
way
thereafter.
because
of
all
of
those
reasons,
the
evidence
of
his
conduct
was
admissible,
should
have
been
admitted,
and
the
case
should
not
have
been
reversed
on
that
account.
that's
all
i
have,
your
honor,
unless
you
have
any
further
questions.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
thank
you,
your
honor.
it
is
no
remedy
for
dr.
patrick
that
he
could
have
complained
to
the
board
of
medical
examiners
of
the
conduct
of
defendants
and
maybe
lead
to
ultimately
perhaps
for
the
defendants
losing
their
license
to
practice
medicine
in
the
state
of
oregon.
that
is
not
a
review
of
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
and
it
gives
him
no
remedy
at
all
for
what
happened
to
him
at
the
hospital.
what
counsel
is
avoiding
saying
is
that
the
board
of
medical
examiners
has
no
power
to
do
anything
about
peer
review
in
this
case
or
in
any
other
case.
what
counsel
has
done
is
to
argue
the
policy,
but
the
policy
has
already
been
established
by
the
state
law.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
that
is
because
the
function
of
the
state
board
of
medical
examiners
is
to
pass
on
the
qualification
of
physicians
to
have
a
state
license
to
practice
medicine
within
the
state.
obviously,
if
a
hospital
disciplines
a
physician,
terminates
their
privileges,
the
same
grounds
that
justified
that
may
be
grounds
for
taking
away
the
license
of
that
physician.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
oh,
not
at
all.
not
at
all.
in
fact,
of
course,
and
the
evidence
showed
that
the
defendants
had
brought
him
before
the
state
board
of
medical
examiners
once
before
that
led
to
a
letter
of
reprimand.
when
the
circumstances
of
the
letter
of

out,

revoked

mr.
barbee
b.

no,
your
honor,
none
at
all.
and
it's
never
been
done.
and
i
don't
understand
counsel
to
say
that
it
does,
either.
the
policy
which
counsel
argues,
on
the
one
hand
urging
that
this
is
necessary
to
protect
peer
review,
is
a
policy
that
has
already
been
addressed
by
the
state
of
oregon,
by
the
legislatures
of
most
states
and
by
the
congress.
there
is
a
balance
to
be
drawn
and
that
balance
has
already
been
struck
by
every
legislative
body
that
has
looked
into
it,
and
this
court
should
not
need
to
second
guess
that.
counsel
focuses
on
the
fact
that
dr.
patrick
resigned
from
his
hospital
privileges.
bear
in
mind
that
he
did
not
have
any
kind
of
an
administrative
remedy
through
any
state
body.
the
hospital
was
a
coconspirator.
the
hospital
was
a
defendant
in
this
case
which
settled
just
before
the
eve
of
trial.
there
is
no
precedent
of
this
court
which
requires
a
plaintiff
in
an
antitrust
suit
to
go
through
a
procedure
established
by
one
of
the
defendants
who
is
a
coconspirator
and
indeed
a
defendant
in
the
case.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
yes,
your
honor.
he
resigned
because
he
knew
that
under
medical
practice
that
the
result
would
be
a
foregone
conclusion
and
that
if
his
privileges
were
revoked
by
this
committee,
he
would
not
be
able
to
practice
in
any
other
hospital
and
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
malpractice
coverage.
that
was
in
mitigation
of
damages.
he
did,
after
this,
continue
to
work
at
a
small
hospital.
if
he
had
not
done
what
he
did,
the
damages
would
have
been
even
greater
because
his
practice
would
have
been
damaged
even
more
than
it
was.
i
do
object
to
counsel's
continuing
to
argue
the
merits
of
this
case
when
counsel
says,
for
example,
that...
to
argue
the
merits
of
whether
dr.
patrick's
practice
was
sufficient
or
not
when
counsel
says
that
he
was
practicing
some
exotic
surgery...
that
is
counsel's
interpretation.
i
do
not
even
believe
that
was
the
interpretation
by
the
witness
on
which
he
is
relying.
and
the
testimony
that
he's
talking
about
when
he
says
that
was
a
criticism
that
was
made
by
consultant
to
the
board
of
medical
examiners
against
the
defendant,
the
surgeon
in
the
astoria
clinic
equally
with
the
defendant.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
it
is
none,
your
honor.
and
i'm
glad
you
said
that,
your
honor.
as
for
oregon
or.
rev.
stat.
41.675,
which
counsel
tells
the
court
creates
right
of
judicial
review.
what
the
statute
is
is
a
statute
that--
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
--i'm
reading
from
page
46
of
their
brief,
your
honor.
all
this
statute
is
is
a
statute
that
has
to
do
with
the
evidentiary
privileges.
and
what
it
says
is
that
the
state,
the
evidentiary
statute
that
says
this
evidence
is
not
admissible
does
not
apply,
"in
a
judicial
proceeding
in
which
a
health
care
practitioner
contests
the
denial,
restriction
or
termination
of
clinical
privileges
by
a
health
care
facility.
"
from
that
evidentiary
statute,
he
would
elaborate
and
invent
a
judicial
remedy.
it
doesn't
exist.
we
say
that
that
statute
is
consistent
with
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
you
have
a
state
statute
that
says
that
defendants
are
liable
for
damages
if
they
act
in
bad
faith.
you
have
another
evidentiary
statute
that
says
that
the
evidence
is
admissible
in
such
a
proceeding
where
a
practitioner
contests
what
happened
with
him.
that
statute
is
consistent
with
our
bringing
this
action.
it
does
not
create
an
administrative
procedure
which
takes
away
our
right
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
will
rest
with
the
inference
that's
drawn
from
that
statute.
mr.
barbee
b.
lyon
yes,
your
honor.
one
last
point.
the
two
cases
of
the
oregon
supreme
court,
both
cases
in
which
the
court
refused
to
decide
whether
it
had
any
authority
to
do
anything
about
these
at
all.
one
of
those
cases
was
a
mandamus
case
where
the
plaintiff
brought
an
action
under
the
state
provisions
of
mandamus.
mandamus
has
always
been
said
by
the
oregon
supreme
court
to
be
an
extraordinary
remedy
only
available
for
a
clear
breach
of
duty
and
is
one
that
is
disfavored
in
the
law.
even
with
that,
the
court
said
that
it
did
not
know
whether
that
remedy
existed.
if
this
court
is
going
to
find
for
the
first
time
that
that
kind
of
review
is
a
sufficient
state
action,
if
the
court
is
going
to
find
that
judicial
review
is
sufficient
supervision
of
this
kind
of
conduct,
it
should
at
least
not
make
that
principle
for
the
first
time
in
a
case
where
the
state
supreme
court
does
not
even
know
that
it
has
that
power.
i
have
nothing
further
unless
the
court
has
questions.
