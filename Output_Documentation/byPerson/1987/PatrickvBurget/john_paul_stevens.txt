justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
a
peer
review
committee
determines
that
a
doctor
is
not
fit
to
practice
in
a
particular
hospital,
does
the
committee
have
any
duty
to
institute
proceedings
to
exclude
the
doctor
from
the
practice
of
medicine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
that
happen
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
that
happen
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
resigned
from
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
triplett,
you're
explaining
why
you
think
he
should
have
exhausted
before
he
filed
a
lawsuit
against
your
clients.
but
the
question
i
was
trying
to
seek
an
answer
to
is,
if
the
real
purpose
of
peer
review
is
to
get
rid
of
incompetent
doctors,
and
if
you
found
a
doctor
that
you
think
is
so
incompetent
that
he
should
be
denied
hospital
privileges,
why
wouldn't
you
report
that
to
some
public
authority
instead
of
just
closing
the
file
because
he
says,
well,
i'll
resign
from
your
hospital?
can
he
avoid
disciplinary
proceedings
by
simply
resigning
from
the
hospital,
if
the
statute
has
the
purpose
you
describe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
why
did
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
you
don't
if
you're
interested
in
defending
a
lawsuit,
but
if
you're
interested
in
getting
rid
of
incompetent
doctors,
i
think
you
do.
i
think
it's
rather
clear.
if
this
is
a
public
body
seeking
to
get,
as
you
describe
it,
actively
supervised
by
the
state,
it
seems
to
me
they
should
perform
that
mission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
the
remedy
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
just
a
lawsuit,
you
mean?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
board
could
direct
the
hospital
to
reinstate
a
doctor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
doctor
brings
a
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
is
there
a
state
law
that
prescribes
the
procedures
to
be
followed
at
a
peer
review
proceeding?
sort
of
a
miniature
administrative
procedure
act
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
no
state
law
that
says
how
these
proceedings
shall
be
conducted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
say
what
the
burden
of
proof
is,
or
what
the
grounds
are
for
disqualification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
kind
of
evidence
is
received?
or
who
can
testify?
does
it
have
any
of
that
kind
of
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by-laws
of
the
hospital?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
the
health
division
of
the
state
of
oregon
tell
them
to
rewrite
the
by-laws?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
by-laws
on
peer
review
can?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
they
adopted
any
rules
relating
to
peer
review
commissions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
have
authority
to
adopt
these
rules.
have
they
adopted
any
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
a
rule
describing
how
a
peer
review
shall
be
conducted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
that
division
have
the
right
to
reverse
a
decision
of
a
peer
review
committee
to
deny
hospital
privileges?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
state
board
have
any
power
to
compel
a
hospital
to
allow
a
doctor
to
have
staff
privileges?
