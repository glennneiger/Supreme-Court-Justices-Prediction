justice
sandra

o'connor
is
there
no
mechanism
in
oregon
in
your
view
for
a
judicial
review
of
the
deprivation
of
the
privilege
to
restore
that
privilege?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
perhaps
that
power
exists?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
wasn't
pursued
by
your
client
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
don't
know.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
i
guess
there
is
a
state
action
for
interference
with
business
relations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
also
was
not
pursued?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
a
form
of
state
supervision
in
a
sense,
do
you
think,
to
provide
that
kind
of
an
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lyon,
do
you
think
that
in
order
to
fit
under
the
parker-brown
exception,
there
has
to
be
a
cadre
of
state
officials
that
actually
review
each
decision
of
the
peer
review
committee
and
have
the
chance
to
second
guess
those
committees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
look
at
the
ama
filed
brief
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
the
alternative
recommendations
given
in
that
brief
are
satisfactory
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
triplett,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
oregon's
law,
the
only
thing
that's
reasonably
foreseeable
is
that
peer
review
action
might
take
place
in
good
faith.
there
is
a
law
in
oregon
that
does
not
extend
immunity
to
people
in
peer
review
processes
that's
taken
in
bad
faith.
so
it
would
seem
to
me
that
at
best,
you
could
characterize
the
state
policy
of
oregon
as
allowing
or
making
it
reasonably
foreseeable
that
some
doctors
would
be
disciplined
and
removed
from
practice
by
action
taken
in
good
faith.
and
i
might
ask
you
also
to
comment
on
whether
that
doesn't
in
fact
parallel
the
law
the
federal
government
has
now
enacted
authorizing
only
good
faith
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
triplett,
are
there
any
instances
cited
to
us
where
either
the
state
health
division
or
the
board
of
medical
examiners
have
actually
intervened
in
cases
to
assure
a
correction
of
substantive
abuses
like
those
alleged
here
in
the
process,
or
directed
procedural
changes
to
avoid
problems?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
any
one
else?
