justice
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
wallace?
i
gather
you
have
to
persuade
us
that
to
engage
in
activities,
is
virtually
meaningless,
do
you
not?
justice
jr.
well,
what
does
it
mean,
do
you
think?
justice
jr.
well,
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
evidence,
whatever,
that
they
had
any
intention
of
engaging
in
any
activities.
this
rests,
does
it
not,
entirely
on
the
fact
that
they
are
members
of
what,
the
communist
party?
justice
jr.
and
by
reason
of
their
association
of
one
or
the
other
or
more
of
those
organizations,
that
they
were
said
to
be
excludable
under
the
statute?
