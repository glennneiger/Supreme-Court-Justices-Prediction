justice
marshall
mr.
wallace,
it
was
charged
that
they
were
going
to
engage
in
those
activities
in
this
country?
justice
marshall
like
what?
making
a
speech?
justice
marshall
freedom
of
speech?
justice
marshall
there
is
nothing
other
than
speech
involved?
justice
marshall
but
do
you
need
our
courts
for
that
purpose...
to
enforce
public
policy
in
foreign
governments
and
to
prevent
foreign
governments?
justice
marshall
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
court
can
approve
the
denial
of
an
entry
of
somebody
who
is
going
to
make
a
speech,
because
the
state
department
does
not
like
the
country
or
the
person.
