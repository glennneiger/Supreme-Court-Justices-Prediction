mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
it
is
obvious
from
the
government's
argument
that
the
issues
raised
in
this
case
are
critical
ones
in
a
constitutional
democracy...
whether
and
to
what
extent,
the
government
may
bar
foreign
speakers
from
addressing
american
audiences
in
the
united
states,
on
issues
of
obvious
and
substantial
public
concern?
as
the
government
points
out
and
i
just
want
to
reiterate,
because
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
an
analysis
of
the
case,
there
are
two
separate
but
related
statutory
questions
before
the
court
today.
one
is,
whether
(a)(27)
section
212(a)(27),
applies
in
the
absence
of
any
allegation
by
the
government
that
the
excluded
foreign
speaker
is
likely
to
engage
in
prejudicial
activities,
if
admitted
to
the
united
states?
the
second
question,
which
the
government
barely
reached
in
its
argument,
is
whether
the
executive
may
circumvent
the
congressional
restrictions
embodied
in
the
mcgovern
amendment,
by
using
an
alien's
organizational
membership
as
the
basis
for
exclusion
under
(a)(27)?
i
must
say
that
i
am
somewhat
flabbergasted
by
mr.
wallace's
argument,
today,
which
apparently
abandons
the
principle
legal
contention
that
the
government
has
advanced
in
this
case
from
day
one.
and
that
is,
until
30
minutes
ago,
the
government's
position
in
this
case,
was
that
an
alien
could
be
excluded,
a
foreign
speaker
could
be
excluded
from
the
united
states,
based
on
the
contention
that
his
or
her
mere
entry
or
presence
in
the
united
states
were
prejudicial
to
the
public
interest.
that
was
the
government's
phrase
not
ours,
but
that
the
alien's
mere
entry
or
presence
in
the
united
states
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
public
interest.
that
argument,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
as
the
government
now
apparently
concedes,
is
simply
impossible
to
square
with
either
the
language
or
the
history
of
(a)(27).
indeed,
the
extent
to
which
the
government
has,
at
least
until
today,
construed
its
authority
under
(a)(27),
is
illustrated
by
the
example
of
nino
pasti.
pasti
is
a
former
nato
general,
a
former
italian
senator,
and
he
worked
in
the
pentagon
for
three
years
as
a
liaison
between
the
italian
armed
services
and
the
united
states
armed
services.
in
1983,
he
was
invited
to
address
a
disarmament
rally
on
boston
commons
by
an
american
peace
group
and
he
was
denied
the
visa
on
the
grounds
that
the
government
feared
that
he
would
spread
disinformation,
if
permitted
to
enter
the
united
states,
and
give
his
views
on
the
propriety
of
american
missiles
in
europe.
the
statute
that
we
are
dealing
with,
(a)(27),
quite
plainly
speaks
to
the
requirement
of
activities.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
the
way
that
i
understand
its
argument,
now,
your
honor,
and
i
must
say
that
there
were
seeds
of
this
in
its
brief,
is
that
its
previous
argument
was
that
it
did
not
need
to
allege
any
activities,
and
indeed,
it
has
not
alleged
any
activities.
not
only
is
there
no
finding
of
prejudicial
activities,
but
by
any
of
the
courts
who
have
ruled
on
this
question
below,
if
you,
in
fact,
look
at
the
affidavits
submitted
by
the
government...
either
their
original
public
affidavits,
or
their
original
classified
and
now
declassified
affidavits...
you
will
not
see
any
reference
to
prejudicial
activities.
what
you
will
see
is
a
conclusion
that
the
alien's
mere
entry
or
presence
in
the
united
states
is
prejudicial.
what
i
now
understand
the
government
to
be
saying
is,
that
a
claim
of
mere
entry
or
presence
is
not
sufficient
under
(a)(27),
but
we
have
more,
and
they
say
this
in
their
brief,
since
after
all
any
alien
who
enters
the
country
necessarily
engages
in
some
activity.
and
the
activities
that
they
cite
in
their
brief,
as
an
illustration
of
that
legal
contention
are:
every
alien
eats,
sleeps,
travels
in
the
united
states.
those
are
activities
sufficient
to
invoke
(a)(27).
i
think
that
is
equally
a
fallacious
ruling
of
(a)(27)
since
(a)(27)
does
not
require
some
activities,
it
requires
activities
prejudicial
to
the
public
interest.
and
the
government
has
not
claimed
that
the
sleeping
or
eating
is
prejudicial
to
the
public
interest,
it
is
just
another
way
or
restating
a
position,
which
i
think
that
the
government
now
understands
they
cannot
sustain
and
that
is--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--just
his
presence
here
would
be,
you
are
right,
that
is
exactly
their
position,
your
honor.
that
what
he
does
is--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--that
what
he
does
is
irrelevant.
that
merely
his
presence
in
the
united
states
is
prejudicial.
my
answer
to
that
is,
a
visa
denial
based
on
that
allegation
was
never
authorized
or
contemplated
by
congress
when
they
adopted
section
212
(a)(27),
because
section
212
(a)(27)
provides
that
an
alien
may
be
excluded
if
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
they
will
engage
in
prejudicial
activities,
not
if
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
their
presence
in
the
united
states
may
be
prejudicial
to
the
united
states'
foreign
policy.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
i
am
saying
that
that
is
not
a
(27)
exclusion.
as
we
said,
in
the
court
below,
and
we
continue
to
believe,
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
including
section
212(f)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
which
may
well
permit
the
government
under-certain
circumstances
to
exclude
somebody
because
their
mere
presence
in
the
united
states
is
prejudicial
to
foreign
policy
interests.
but
those
other
sections
of
the
act
are
hinged
in
by
other
procedural
protections
that
congress
has
provided,
namely
in
the
case
of
212(f),
the
requirement
of
a
presidential
finding
to
make
sure
that
our
government
is
not
excluding
foreign
speakers
based
merely
on
a
bureaucratic
judgment
that
their
speeches
in
the
united
states
are
likely
to
create
problems
for
american
foreign
policy
interests.
and
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
affidavits--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--i
think
that
the
government,
in
the
case
of
borge,
the
government's
position
is,
that
his
mere
presence
in
the
united
states
will
create
problems
for
us.
and
our
answer
to
that,
and
the
answer
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
that,
is
that
is
not
what
section
212(a)(27)
provides,
and
that
is
the
only
statutory
authority
that
the
government
has
cited
in
this
case.
with
regard
to
pasti,
if
you
look
at
the
affidavits
concerning
pasti,
either
the
public
or
classified
affidavits,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
government's
allegation,
in
that
case,
was
that
his
presence
in
the
united
states
would
create
problems
because
they
did
not
like
what
they
expected
him
to
say
on
the
boston
commons
about
american
pershing
missiles
in
europe
and
he
was
a
person
who
came
to
that
setting
with
great
credibility,
because
he
was
formerly
the
chief
nuclear
strategist
for
nato.
and
they
would
prefer
not
to
have
him
in
this
country,
at
that
time,
delivering
that
message,
because
it
made
it
more
complicated
for
them
to
put
their
missiles
in
europe.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
indication
that
(a)(27)
permits
a
visa
denial
on
those
grounds.
and
in
terms
of
the
entry
or
presence,
versus
activities
claim,
as
the
court
of
appeals
likewise
pointed
out,
the
government's
interpretation
of
(a)(27)
is
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
immigration
act
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
one
reason
being
that
there
are
33
categories
of
excludable
aliens,
listed
in
section
212
of
the
immigration
act.
congress,
by
and
large,
has
traded,
has
categories
of
exclusion
based
on
status
and
categories
of
exclusion
based
on
conduct.
and
212(a)(28),
which
is
the
exclusionary
provision
at
issue
in
mandel,
which
says
that
communists
cannot
come
into
the
country
unless
they
get
a
waiver,
that
is
a
status
exclusion.
and
212(a)(27),
with
its
reference
to
prejudicial
activities,
is
a
conduct
exclusion
and
the
burden
on
the
government
is
to
show
some
evidence
of
prejudicial
conduct
in
the
united
states
and
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
sustain
that
burden.
as
justice
brennan
also
pointed
out,
the
word,
activities,
is
introduced
by
a
phrase,
that
says,
seeks
to
enter
to
engage
in
activities.
the
word,
to
engage,
not
only
in
the
abstract
is
an
active
verb,
it
does
not
make
sense
to
read
the
language
and
say
that
an
alien
seeks
to
enter
to
engage
in
entry.
that
simply
does
not
make
sense
as
a
grammatical
proposition,
but
within
the
immigration
act,
itself,
the
phrase
"to
engage"
is
a
phrase
that
congress
used
when
it
meant
to
justify,
permit
an
exclusion
based
on
anticipated
conduct
in
the
united
states.
so,
that
the
immigration
act,
for
example,
permits
the
exclusion
of
an
alien
who
seeks
to
enter
to
engage
in
espionage;
seeks
to
enter
to
engage
in
sabotage;
seeks
to
enter
to
engage
in
immoral
sexual
activities.
that
is
the
phraseology
that
congress
used
over
and
over
and
over
again,
in
the
immigration
act,
and
does
not
support
a
reading
of
(a)(27)
that
an
alien
seeks
to
enter
to
engage
in
the
act
of
being
present
in
the
united
states.
it
simply
does
not
make
sense.
let
me
say
something
as
well
about
the
administrative
practice
that
the
government
cites.
the
government
makes
a
variety
of
claims
with
regard
to
past
administrative
practice.
one
being,
that
over
the
last
20
years,
70
million
people
have
been
issued
non-immigrant
visas
and
only
500
or
600
have
been
denied
admission
under
(a)(27).
with
all
due
respect,
that
is
not
an
argument
that
i
understand,
because
to
the
extent
that
those
500
or
600
may
have
been
improper,
they
remain
improper
regardless
of
the
fact
that
60
or
70
million
other
people
may
have
properly
been
granted
visas.
in
terms
of
concrete
illustrations,
concrete
illustrations,
and
the
government
was
questioned
quite
precisely
about
this
in
the
court
of
appeals...
how
many
times
have
you
denied
entry
to
an
alien
under
(a)(27)
based
on
the
alien's
entry
or
presence
in
the
united
states...
the
claim
that
their
entry
or
presence
would
be
prejudicial
to
american
foreign
policy
interests?
the
government
came
up
with
three
examples
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we,
by
the
way,
have
had
no
opportunity
for
discovery,
so
that
we
have
no
idea
of
what
contrary
examples
may
be
in
the
administrative
record.
but
the
government
came
up
with
three
examples
that
mr.
wallace
has,
again,
referred
to
today.
the
example
of
mr.
liao;
the
example
of
madame
nhu;
the
example
of
otto
skorzeny.
and
aside
from
the
fact
that
all
of
them
are
at
least
25
years
old,
mr.
liao
and
madame
nhu
as
the
court
of
appeals
points
out...
the
majority
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals...
were,
in
fact,
excluded
based
upon
anticipated
activities
and
that
is
what
the
correspondence
submitted
by
the
government
to
the
district
court
established.
in
terms
of
otto
skorzeny,
the
former
nazi
general,
he
may
well
have
been
excluded
based
on
his
status
as
a
former
nazi,
but
aside
from
the
fact
that
one
exclusion
30
years
ago,
is
not,
i
do
not
think
probative
of
anything,
let
alone
a
consistent
administrative
practice...
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
in
1978,
congress
amended
the
immigration
act,
to
add
section
212(a)(33)
that
expressly
provides
for
the
exclusion,
now
of
former
nazis.
and
when
they
did
so,
both
the
congressional
sponsors
and
the
justice
department,
itself,
in
a
supporting
letter
submitted
to
congress...
and
these
can
both
be
found
attached
to
the
house
report...
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
nazi
exclusion
provision
that
was
added
in
1978,
was
added
to
fill
an
existing
loophole
in
the
law,
that
previously
the
administration
did
not
have
the
authority
to
keep
people
out
of
that
sort,
or
at
least
congress
did
not
think
that
they
did.
and
congress
wanted
to
fill
the
loophole
and
so
they
passed
the
nazi
amendment.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
i
do
not
think
that
section
27
permits...
well,
several
things.
i
do
not
think
it
is
what
the
government
has
alleged
here.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
what--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--i
do
not
think
that
it
is
what
27
now
says,
and
to
the
degree
that
it
is
what
27
says,
then
i
think
that
you
would
be
smack
up
against
a
significant
first
amendment
problem.
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
need
to
confront
that
problem.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
i
think
that
that
is
outside
of
the
reach
of
the
statute,
because
i
do
not
think
that
the
statute,
with
its
reference
to
prejudicial
activity
was
discussing
speech
making
in
the
united
states,
as
justice
marshall
suggested.
and
i
think
that
is
for
very
good
reason
that
the
government
has
refrained
from
taking
that
position,
all
throughout
this
litigation.
the
government
has
never
come
in,
from
day
one
and--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--well,
to
the
extent,
as
i
said,
to
the
extent
that
the
government's
position
now
is
that
these
people
can
be
excluded
because
they
are
here
to
make
speeches,
and
here
to
make
speeches
which
the
government
openly
admits,
by
the
way,
that
it
is
not
a
viewpoint
neutral
judgment...
if
your
question,
justice
white,
is
meant
to
suggest
that
the
government
does
not
care
what
these
people
are
saying,
that
it
is
the
act
of
making
a
speech,
while
present
in
the
united
states,
circa
(a)(27),
first
of
all,
the
record,
itself,
does
not
support
that.
if
you
look
at
the
classified
affidavits
submitted
by
undersecretary
eagleburger
with
regard
to
nino
pasti,
for
example,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
state
department's
objection
is,
that
at
the
time
that
we
were
engaged
in
the
critical
negotiations
about
the
deployment
of
the
american
pershing
missiles
in
europe,
they
anticipated
that
nino
pasti
would
come
to
the
united
states
and
tell
people
that
those
missiles
were
not
necessary
or
appropriate.
to
the
degree
that
the
government's
position
is
that
it
is
that
anticipated
speech
that
justifies
their
exclusion
under
(a)(27),
i
do
not
think
that
(a)(27)
provides
that
and
if
(a)(27)
provides
that,
i
do
not
think
that
the
constitution
permits
that.
and
one
of
the--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
i
think
that--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--well,
that
is
a
hard
question
for
us
to
answer,
as
i
will
explain
in
a
moment.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
well,
let
me
give
you
the
background
on
what
happened,
having
been
there
since
the
case--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--what
judge
green's
opinion
says,
is
that
the
government
may
not
deny
visas
for
content-based
reasons.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
and
having
read
the
public
affidavits,
submitted
by
undersecretary
eagleburger,
which
in
conclusory
fashion,
simply
recited
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
said,
i
denied
these
visas,
because
i
determined
that
their
admission
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
public
interest.
he
said,
he
read
the
public
affidavits.
they
do
not
satisfy
me,
and
i
do
not
know
what
they
mean.
he
then
entertained
the
government's
classified
affidavits,
in
camera,
ex
parte,
without
sharing
them
with
us,
and
he
wrote
in
his
opinion...
because
these
were
still
ex
parte
classified
affidavits...
that
i
have
read
the
affidavits
and
i
am
convinced
that
the
government
had
legitimate
and
bona
fide
reasons
which
he,
then,
did
not
explain,
because
at
that
point
they
were
still
classified.
that
is
the
difficulty
in
understanding
the
district
court's--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--i
think
that
he
accepted
the
government's
position
that
mere
presence
is
enough.
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
position
that
mere
presence
is
enough.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
and
one
of
the
things,
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
on
two
grounds.
and
one
of
the
court
of
appeals'
remands
was
to
determine
exactly--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--their
position
was,
that
entry
or
presence
is
not
enough.
it
looks
to
us,
from
your
affidavits,
that
that
is
why
you
kept
these
people
out
but
since
we
are
sending
it
back
for
some
other
reasons,
you
might
want
a
better
opportunity
to
explain
to
the
district
court
if
you
had
some
reasons
other
than
entry
or
presence,
because
the
court
of
appeals
likewise
read
the
current
state
of
the
record,
as
supporting
an
exclusion
based
only
on
entry
or
presence.
the
other
difficulty
with
reading
(a)(27),
to
permit
exclusions
based
on
entry
or
presence,
is
that
it
really
then
does
run
smack
up
into
the
mcgovern
amendment,
which
i
want
to
just
discuss
for
a
moment.
there
are
vastly
greater
numbers,
or
there
historically
have
been
vastly
greater
numbers
of
aliens
kept
out
of
the
united
states
under
section
(a)(28)
rather
than
(a)(27).
and
(a)(28)
being
the
statute
that
was
at
issue
in
manuel,
which
basically
says,
if
you
are
a
member
of
a
communist
organization
or
if
you
advocate
the
doctrines
of
communism,
you
shall
be
excluded
from
the
united
states,
unless
the
attorney
general
grants
you
a
waiver.
in
1977,
congress
adopted
the
mcgovern
amendment,
to
promote
the
principles
of
the
helsinki
accords
as
it
states
in
its
preambles.
and
what
the
mcgovern
amendment
essentially
says
is,
we
no
longer
want
to
keep
people
out
based
on
this
notion
of
guilt
by
association.
and
so,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
aliens
may
belong
to
communist
organizations,
or
be
affiliated
with
communist
organizations,
our
presumption
is
they
will
now
be
admitted
to
the
united
states,
unless
the
government
executive
is
are
prepared
to
certify
that
both
houses
of
congress
that
national
security
interests
are
at
stake.
even
if
you
put
the
best
gloss
possible
on
the
government's
affidavits,
what
you
will
find,
at
least
with
regard
to
nino
pasti
and
the
two
cuban
women,
is
that
the
government's
position
is
that
pasti
is
a
member
of
the
world
peace
council
and
the
world
peace
council
is
affiliated
with
the
soviet
union.
the
soviet
union
is
engaged
in
a
propaganda
campaign
and
therefore,
pasti
must
also
be
engaged
in
a
propaganda
campaign.
there
is
no
specific
allegation
with
regard
to
nino
pasti
that
is
independent
of
an
assumption
that
the
government
made
based
on
his
organizational
affiliation.
he
is
connected
to
this
group
and
this
group
is
doing
bad
things,
and
therefore,
we
presume
that
if
we
allow
him
into
the
country,
he
will
do
similar
bad
things.
that
is
precisely
our
position,
at
least
is,
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
leap,
the
kind
of
presumption,
the
kind
of
guilt
by
association,
that
congress
meant
to
prohibit
by
the
mcgovern
amendment.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
believe
that
these
speakers
were
excluded
under
(a)(27),
rather
than
(a)(28),
where
they
would
have
more
naturally
belonged,
is
precisely
because
the
government
did
not
want
to
have
to
deal
with
the
rigors
of
the
mcgovern
amendment,
because
the
government
was
not
prepared,
in
fact,
to
certify
to
both
houses
of
congress,
that
national
security
would
be
jeopardized
if
nino
pasti
were
allowed
in
the
united
states
and
permitted
to
give
the
speech
that
he
wants
to
give
on
the
boston
commons.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
i
think
that
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
and
this
is
where
there
are
two
statutory
issues
before
the
court.
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
interpretation
of
(a)(27),
that
it
requires
activities
and
not
mere
entry
or
presence,
then
i
think
that
all
of
these
visa
denials
fall,
borge's
included.
if
the
court
concludes
that
entry
or
presence
is
encompassed
within
(a)(27),
then
i
think
that
we
still
have
to
deal
with
the
mcgovern
amendment.
we
would
still
say
that
the
prejudice,
flowing
from
entry
or
presence,
has
to
really
be
tied
to
the
individual
not
based
on
organizational
membership
and
at
that
point,
it
may
be
that
borge
would
be
in
a
different
situation
than
pasti
is
and
the
two
cuban
women.
i
mean,
borge,
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
sandinista
junta.
he
is
an
official
of
the
nicaraguan
government.
nobody
disputes
that.
at
the
very
least
the
allegations
connected
to
him,
are
connected
to
him
personally.
the
allegations
connected
to
pasti
and
to
finlay
and
to
lezcano,
are
connected
to
them
because
of
the
organizations
to
which
they
belong,
and
that
is,
we
think,
forbidden
by
the
mcgovern
amendment,
regardless
of
how
you
decide
the
other
(a)(27)
question
about
entry
or
presence.
and
let
me
come
back
to
the
entry
or
presence
issue
for
one
more
moment,
then,
just
debunk
this
reliance
on
legislative
history.
the
government
makes
a
passing
nod
to
the
doctrine
of
plain
language
that
any
analysis
of
the
statute
has
to
begin
with
the
language
which
the
congress
has
drafted,
and
it
then,
for
very
understandable
reasons,
wants
to
get
off
that
language
as
quickly
as
possible,
because,
it,
in
fact,
speaks
to
activities
and
not
entries
or
presence.
and
where
it
winds
up
is
in
the
legislative
history.
and
the
government's
position
with
regard
to
the
legislative
history
and
it
was
a
position
that
was
echoed
by
judge
bork,
in
dissent,
below,
is
that
over
the
40
or
50
years
that
this
statute
has
been
developing,
there
are
five
or
six
references
in
committee
reports,
to
the
words,
entry
or
presence,
and
therefore,
that
supports
the
claim
that
when
congress
referred
to
activities,
it
really
meant
to
include
entry
and
presence
within
the
term,
activities.
as
we
point
out,
in
our
brief,
if
you
in
fact,
look
at
the
full
passages
cited
by
the
government
and
not
the
isolated
phrases
that
i
believe
the
government
takes
out
of
context,
you
will
see
that
every
reference
to
entry
or
presence
is
followed
by
a
reference
in
the
next
clause,
or
the
next
sentence,
to
prejudicial
activities
within
the
united
states.
and
that,
on
the
basis
of
a
full
and
fair
reading
of
the
legislative
history,
it
seems
quite
clear,
that
what
congress
has
been
consistently
concerned
about,
in
(a)(27)
and
its
predecessor
statutes,
was
entry
and
presence
to
engage
in
prejudicial
activities.
and
(27),
if
it
is
linked
to
anything,
it
is
more
closely
linked
to
(29).
that
talks
about
entry
to
engage
in
sabotage
or
espionage.
and
that
what
congress
understood,
i
think,
is
that
there
are
some
activities
that
may
not
rise
to
the
level
of
sabotage
or
espionage,
but
nonetheless
are
prejudicial
activities.
it
is
a
very
big
leap
to
go
from
there
to
the
claim
that
either
no
activities
are
required
at
all,
under
(27)
despite
its
language,
or
that
the
kinds
of
activities
that
congress
meant
to
prohibit
or
meant
to
justify
a
ban
under
(27),
included
speech
making.
and
when
you
look
at
the
statements
that
senator
mccarren
made
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
when
he
introduced
the
predecessor
provision
in
1950...
in
1952,
when
section
212(a)(27)
was
enacted,
there
was
very
little
colloquy
or
conference
language
about
the
provision.
and
there
was
more
in
1950
when
its
predecessor's
provision,
the
internal
security
act
was
adopted
and
what
senator
mccarren,
quite
clearly
says,
and
we
cite
it
in
our
brief,
is
that
his
concern,
the
concern
of
congress,
was
with
aliens
who
seek
to
enter
or
engage
after
entry,
in
activities
prejudicial
to
the
public
interest,
and
he,
in
fact,
referred
to
the
requirement
of
overt
acts.
and
as
i
have
said,
previously,
this
record
is
totally
barren
of
any
allegation
that
even
comes
close
to
that.
let
me
raise
just
a
few
other
points
with
you.
in
terms
of...
to
come
back
to
administrative
practice,
for
a
second...
the
government
does
not
make
very
much
mention
of
the
contemporaneous
administrative
record,
which
under
standard
doctrine
of
statutory
construction
is,
if
anything,
more
relevant
than
current
interpretations.
in
terms
of
contemporaneous
interpretations
of
(a)(27),
there
are
two
things
worth
noting.
one
is
a
board
of
immigration
appeals
decision
in
1953,
in
which
the
government
attempted
to
exclude
a
pacifist
from
the
united
states
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
one
year
after
(a)(27)
was
adopted,
said,
no,
you
cannot
do
that.
you
are
keeping
him
out
on
the
basis
of
status.
and
(a)(27)
requires
activities.
he
was,
i
think,
engaged
in
a
speech
making
tour,
justice
rehnquist.
the
bia
in
1953
said
that
that
is
not
enough,
under
(a)(27).
the
other
thing
that
i
want
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
and
i
say
this
with
regret,
but
it
does
not
appear
in
either
side's
brief,
or
in
the
opinion
by
the
court
of
appeals,
are
some
1952
regulations
by
the
state
department
on
(a)(27),
which
disappeared
in
1954.
since
1954,
the
state
department
has
had
no
substantive
regulations
interpreting
this
section.
but
from
1952
until
1954,
and
this
appears
at
17
federal
register,
page
11590,
and
december
19th,
1952.
the
section
on
(a)(27)
says,
the
provision
of
section
212(a)(27)
that
the
act
shall
be
considered
to
relate
to
the
ineligibility
of
aliens
to
receive
visas,
because
of
their
purpose,
plan,
intention
or
design,
whether
solely,
principally,
or
incidentally
to
engage
in
activities
after
arrival
in
the
u.s.,
which
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
public
interest,
or
would
endanger
the
welfare,
safety
or
security
of
the
united
states.
once
again,
the
emphasis
on
activities
after
admission,
not
somebody
whose
mere
entry
or
presence,
because
of
their
status,
would
create
difficulties
for
the
government.
let
me
just
wind
up
by
making
a
brief
comment
about
the
first
amendment
issue
in
this
case.
we
raised
the
first
amendment
claim-in
the
district
court.
it
was
not
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
of
its
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language.
it
is
not
before
this
court,
in
any
real
and
concrete
way.
it
was
not
raised
by
the
government
in
its
cert
petition.
but
i
think
it
undeniable,
that
the
interpretation
and
application
of
these
statutes,
in
these
cases,--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--no,
what
the
government
did,
your
honor,
what
the
government
did,
in
their
petition,
in
fact,
was
to
drop
a
footnote
on
the
final
page
of
their
brief
on
the
merits,
saying
that
even
though,
we
have
not
raised
the
first
amendment
question
in
our
questions
presented,
it
was
reached
by
dissent
below,
it
was
alleged
by
the
plaintiffs,
and
therefore,
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
and
should
reach
out
to
decide
it.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
decide
the
first
amendment
question,
but
i
do
think
that
the
presence
of
significant
first
amendment
claims
has
to
affect
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and
that
the
statute
can,
and
should
be
interpreted,
in
a
way
that
minimizes
its
first
amendment
difficulties,
and
that
is
not
the
case,
if
the
statute
is
interpreted
to
permit
exclusions
from
the
united
states,
based
on
a
claim
that
an
alien's
substantive
speeches
within
the
united
states,
create
prejudice
to
american
foreign
policy
interests.
and
i
do
not
believe,
as
justice
o'connor's
question
indicated
and
i
was
delighted
to
hear
the
government's
response,
i
do
not
believe
this
court,
by
any
means,
foreclosed
the
first
amendment
issue
in
mandel.
mandel
was
a
case,
in
which
the
excluded
foreign
speaker
was
kept
out
of
the
united
states,
because
he
had
violated
the
terms
of
a
past
visa,
by
engaging
in
activities
that
were
not
permitted
under
that
visa.
nothing
in
the
holding
of
mandel,
i
do
not
believe,
even
remotely
suggests
that
if
the
government
keeps
somebody
out
of
the
country,
because
it
does
not
like
the
speeches,
they
are
likely
to
give
in
this
country,
that
that
is
a
facially
legitimate
and
bona
fide
reason.
and
i
think
that
those
first
amendment
considerations
have
to
necessarily
at
least
be
part
of
the
process,
of
interpreting
the
statute
to
conform,
not
only
with
constitutional
requirements,
but
to
conform
with,
what
i
believe,
is
the
clear
and
obvious
intent
of
congress,
as
reflected
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
a
fairly
consistent
legislative
history.
thank
you,
very
much.
