justice
stevens
is
it
critical
to
your
position
that
the
activities
be
activities
that
could
be
attributed
to
the
organizations
with
which
the
three
people
were
associated?
justice
stevens
you
seem
to
suggest
that
on
an
earlier
statement?
justice
stevens
well,
then,
it
is
not
a
case
of
mere
presence
or
mere
entry?
your
proof
is
that
these
people
are
engaging
in
activities
on
behalf
of
some
organization.
justice
stevens
that
is
a
different
theory
than
the
dissent
below,
i
think.
justice
stevens
so
you
are
not
espousing
the
theory
of
the
dissent?
justice
stevens
well,
you
are
not
arguing
that
mere
presence
and
mere
entry
is
an
activity,
within
the
meaning
of
subsection
27?
or
are
you?
justice
stevens
is
there
a
finding
here,
that
it
was
the
activities
in
which
they
intended
to
engage
that
explain
the
reason
for
their
exclusion?
justice
stevens
no,
i
said,
was
there
a
finding
to
that
effect?
justice
stevens
i
still
ask
is
the
facially
valid
reason
the
fact
that
their
mere
presence
or
mere
entry
would
be
detrimental,
or
is
it,
that
the
activities
in
which
they
would
engage
would
be
detrimental?
what
is
the
finding?
justice
stevens
it
would
make
a
difference
in
this.
justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
the
thing
that
troubles
me
is
that
you
are
telling
me
what
the
affidavits
say,
but
the
finding
just
relates
to
the
personal
status
of
the
three
people.
i
would
think
that
it
would
apply
going
to
a
funeral,
that
they
were
not
denied
because
of
the
content
of
their
expected
speeches,
but
because
of
their
personal
status,
as
officials
of
governments
or
organizations,
which
are
hostile
to
the
united
states.
i
would
think
that
would
apply
if
they
wanted
to
come
in
and
have
lunch.
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
just
ask
you,
is
it
necessary
for
us
to
support
your
position
to
go
behind
the
finding,
and
rely
on
what
is
in
the
affidavits,
instead
of
what
the
finding
says?
justice
stevens
that
is
your
whole
argument,
is
it
not?
justice
stevens
we
have
the
affidavits.
justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
about
the
nazi
who
was...
skorzeny,
i
think
that
you
referred
to?
justice
stevens
that
was
back
in
1959,
and
is
it
not
true
that
a
few
years
later,
they
amended
the
statute
to
provide
a
new
section
that
covered
the
people
of
that
status?
justice
stevens
no,
but
i
was
just
wondering,
if
you
are
correctly
interpreting
27,
and
you
gave
us
an
example,
this
skorzeny,
why
did
they
need
to
enact
33?
they
could
have
used
27?
