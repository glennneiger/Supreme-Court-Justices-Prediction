chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments,
first
this
afternoon,
in
number
86-656,
ronald
reagan
versus
james
abourezk,
and
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
when
you
speak
about
a
finding
in
this
case,
actually
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
government,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
are
not
talking
about
finding,
in
the
ordinary
sense,
of
a
finding
of
fact
at
a
bench
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
and
now,
we
will
hear
from
you,
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
understood
the
government's
position,
particularly
with
respect
to
someone
like
mr.
borge,
as
being
just
a
highly
placed
official
of
the
sandinista
government
and
anything
that
he
did
in
this
country
would
be
prejudicial,
just
his
presence
here,
would
be.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
you
are
saying
that
there
cannot
be
someone
of
sufficiently
bad
omen
of
our
foreign
policy
that
anything
that
he
does
in
this
country
would
be
prejudicial?
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
i
do
not
understand
the
government's
version
of
why
it
excluded
borge.
to
be
his
speeches
might
create
problems...
just
that
anything
he
did
here,
his
mere
presence
here
would
create
problems.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
terms
of
the
last
argument
of
yours,
mr.
shapiro,
is
it
possible
that
pasti's
case
could
come
out
one
way
and
borge's
case
come
out
another?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
government
would
not
be
expected
to
raise
it
in
its
petition,
would
it?
the
government
does
not
want
to
claim
that
it
violates
the
first
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
wallace,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace,
the
case
is
submitted.
