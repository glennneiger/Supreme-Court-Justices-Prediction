the
government
has
abandoned
its
prior
position
in
favor
of
what?
just
how
do
you
understand
its
argument?
justice
white
would
you
say,
mr.
shapiro,
suppose
that
the
claim
is
that
section
27
permits
the
exclusion
of
an
alien,
where
his
mere
presence,
for
the
purpose
of
making
speeches,
would
endanger
our
foreign
policy,
would
you
think
that
section
27
would
permit
that?
justice
white
well,
that
is
not
what
i
asked
you.
justice
white
well,
let
us
just
stick
to
the
statute.
if
the
government
says,
well,
look,
his
presence
here,
for
the
purpose
of
making
speeches,
no
matter
what
he
says,
if
our
allies
think
that
we
are
permitting
him
in
this
country
to
be
privy
to
go
around
and
make
speeches,
that
is
just
offends
them.
is
that
outside
the
reach
of
the
statute,
do
you
think?
justice
white
well,
they
were
pretty
close
to
it,
in
this
argument
today,
saying
that
they
may
consider...
what
they
are
here
for,
they
are
here
for
making
speeches.
justice
white
well,
suppose
that
we
disagree
with
you
on
your
construction
of
(27),
that
the
government
may
deny
a
visa
to
a
person
whose
presence
here,
for
the
purpose
of
making
speeches,
would
really
cause
the
government
trouble?
suppose
the
section
covers
that?
are
we
foreclosed
from
reaching
that
ground
here?
justice
white
on
what
basis
did
the
district
court
decide
the
case?
justice
white
well,
it
is
hard
for
us
too,
and
i
want
you
to--
justice
white
--well,
what
does
his
opinion
say?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
well,
do
you
read
his
opinion
as
accepting
the
government's
position
that
mere
presence
is
enough?
justice
white
oh,
i
know
that.
justice
white
that
is
right.
