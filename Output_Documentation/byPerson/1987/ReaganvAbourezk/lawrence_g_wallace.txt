mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
these
cases,
which
were
consolidated
in
the
district
court,
present
questions
concerning
the
denial,
on
foreign
policy
grounds,
of
non-immigrant
visas
to
aliens
invited
by
persons
or
groups
in
this
country
to
participate
in
public
or
academic
discussions.
the
denials
were
based
on
a
provision
that
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
subsection
27,
of
a
list
of
provisions
in
section
1182
of
title
viii,
which
are
provisions
or
bases
for
excluding
aliens
from
the
issuances
of
visas.
and,
in
this
instance,
they
were
denied
as
prejudicial
to
the
public
interest
or
endangering
the
welfare,
safety,
or
security
of
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
held,
and
it
is
not
contested
in
this
court,
that
foreign
policy
concerns
can
be
a
proper
basis
for
a
denial
under
subsection
27;
that
something
detrimental
to
our
foreign
policy
interests
would
be
within
the
broad
formulation
of
prejudicial
to
the
public
interest
or
endangering
the
welfare
of
the
united
states.
and
the
statutory
issues
that
remain
in
the
case,
are
whether
that
denial
can
be
based
on
detriment
to
our
foreign
policy
that
flows
from
the
very
presence
or
entry
of
the
alien
into
this
country?
or
whether
it
must
be
based
strictly
on
something
detrimental
about
the
particular
activities
in
which
he
plans
to
engage?
and
whether,
if
that
question
is
answered
favorably,
to
the
government,
the
authority
that
we
would
then
have
to
deny
the
visas,
under
subsection
27,
has
been
abrogated
by
what
is
commonly
called
the
mcgovern
amendment,
which
amended
another
provision
of
section
1182,
subsection
28.
before--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
would
not
characterize
my
burden
that
way,
mr.
justice.
obviously--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
it,
that
support
our
position.
the
one
that
has
been
more
commonly
used
in
this
litigation
is
to
say
that
presence
or
entry
into
the
united
states
are,
themselves,
activities.
that
is
a
little
difficult
to
reconcile
with
the
words,
"to
engage",
in
activities,
but
it
is
not
beyond
the
pale,
in
light
of
the
legislative
history.
another
way,
which
i
think
may
be
more
helpful,
is
to
say
that,
yes,
they
are
admitted
to
engage
in
activities.
and
that
those
activities,
while
not
detrimental
to
the
public
interest
if
engaged
in
by
somebody
else,
would
be
detrimental
to
the
public
interest,
if
engaged
in
by
this
individual,
because
it
would
involve
his
presence
or
entry
into
the
united
states,
to
engage
in
those
activities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
various
organizations.
in
one
instance,
the
government
of
nicaragua;
in
the
other
instance,
the
federation
of
cuban
women;
and
in
the
third
instance,
a
group
called
the
world
peace
council,
which
was
found
to
be--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
was
by
reason
of
that,
coupled
with
the
state
department's
determination
that
these
organizations
are
instruments
of
a
particular
foreign
government;
and
that
it
would
be
disadvantageous
to
our
conduct
of
foreign
policy,
to
admit
someone
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
that
organization's
program,
in
the
activities
in
which
they
want
to
engage
in
the
united
states.
it
would
be
detrimental
to
our
foreign
policy
just
to
extend
our
hospitality
to
these
individuals,
by
the
issuance
of
a
non-immigrant
visa
to
engage
in
these
activities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
i
mean,
they
wished
to
enter
the
country
to
engage
in
activities.
i
mean,
anyone
who
wants
to
enter
the
country
wants
to
engage
in
activities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
and
to
participate
in
discussions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
undoubtedly,
when
engaged
in
by
someone
properly
present.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
our
position
is
there
need
not
be
any
misconduct
in
the
activities,
themselves,
for
subsection
27
to
apply.
the
activities
might
even
be
constitutionally
protected
activities.
but
subsection
27,
nonetheless
applies,
if
the
presence
or
entry
of
the
individual
to
engage
in
those
activities
would
be
detrimental
to
our
foreign
policy
interests.
and
that
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
is
a
part
of
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
dissent
authorizes
in
its
theory,
a
broader
use
of
subsection
27,
then
we
are
actually
making
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
am
not
disassociating
myself
from
it,
but
we
do
not
have
to
go
as
far
as
some
of
the
implications
of
the
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
one
of
our
alternative
contentions,
yes.
we
have
the
authority
to
decide
that
mere
entry
or
mere
presence
is
an
activity,
that
within
itself,
is
detrimental
to
our
foreign
policy
interests.
but
in
administering
the
statute,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
we
look
at
the
activities
in
which
they
propose
to
engage,
before
making
the
determination
of
whether
entry
or
presence
would
be
detrimental
to
our
foreign
policy.
but
we
do
so
in
a
very
limited
way.
in
other
words,
we
allow
individuals
to
enter,
even
though
we
might
deny
them
entry
for
this
purpose,
but
we
would
allow
them
to
enter
and
we
have
allowed
some
of
these
same
individuals
to
enter...
including
olga
finlay...
to
attend
meetings
of
an
international
body,
such
as
the
united
nations.
we
would
allow
them
to
enter
for
limited
purposes.
we
would
allow
them
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
were
affidavits
submitted--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
finding
by
the
district
judge,
is
that
we
had
facially
valid
foreign
policy
reasons
for
denying
their
entry,
which
under
this
court's
decision,
in
kleindienst
v.
mandel,
he
has
no
right
to
look
behind
and
make
a
finding
with
respect
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
cannot
say
that
the
district
judge's
finding
is
articulated
so
as
to
draw
that
distinction,
as
i
recall
it.
it
would
be
a--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
am
looking
at
page
80-a
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
the
district
court
merely
says,
it
has
concluded
that,
"facially
legitimate
reasons
exist
for
denying
visas
to
the
four
individuals,
whose
entry
is
being
sought
in
these
actions.
"
"and
they
were
not
denied
entry
because
of
the
content
of
the
expected
speeches,
but
because
of
their
personal
status
as
officials
of
governments
or
organizations
which
are
hostile
to
the
united
states.
"
but
the
affidavits,
on
which
he
relies,
do
state,
as
part
of
the
reasons
why
their
entry
would
be
detrimental
to
our
foreign
policy
interests,
is
because
it
is
entry
to
function
as
representatives
of...
in
mr.
borge's
case,
in
the
case
of
the
cuban
women...
of
organizations
controlled
by
the
nicaraguan
or
cuban
governments;
and
in
mr.
pasti's
case,
to
further
the
program
of
an
organization
controlled
by
the
soviet
union.
that
is
necessarily
related
to
the
kinds
of
activities
that
they
propose
to
engage
in.
but
the
distinction
that
we
make,
with
respect
to
activities,
is
not
that
someone
submits
the
speech
that
he
is
planning
to
give,
and
a
board
of
censors
sits
at
the
state
department
and
reads
the
speech
and
decides
whether
giving
that
speech
is
detrimental
to
our
foreign
policy
interests.
it
is
a
distinction
between
entry
for
the
limited
purposes
i
started
to
describe
to
you...
to
attend
an
international
meeting
of
a
body
that
meets
in
the
united
states;
to
conduct
bi-lateral
discussions
with
representatives
of
the
united
states;
humanitarian
entry,
such
as
to
get
medical
treatment;
to
attend
a
family
funeral.
we
would
allow
people
in
for
those
purposes,
but
not
extend
our
general
hospitality
to
them
of
providing
them
with
a
non-immigrant
visa,
because,
as
the
affidavits
explain,
in
the
case
of--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but
the
finding
was
made
based
on
affidavits
that
explain
the
reasons--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
think
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
would
say
that
it
is
necessary
to
read
the
finding
in
light
of
the
affidavits
on
which
the
finding
is
based,
because
the
finding
is
very
succinctly
stated.
the
finding
is
very
responsive
to
this
court's
holding
in
kleindienst
v.
mandel,
that
the
courts
are
not
to
go
behind
facially
legitimate
reasons
that
have
been
given.
and
he
is
relying
on
the
affidavits
as
the
facially
legitimate
reasons,
and
in
a
sense,
the
finding
incorporates
the
affidavits,
if
i
may
say
so.
i
do
not
think
that
the
district
court's
decision
can
be
read
without
reference
to
the
affidavits.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
the
classified
ones
that
he
refers
to,
are
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
because
they
were
declassified
and
reprinted
there.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
it
granted
summary
judgment.
it
concluded
that
there
were
no
material
issues
of
fact
that
it
had
to
resolve
in
light
of
the
facially
legitimate
reasons
given
by
the
government
in
this
series
of
affidavits,
for
the
exclusion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
not
read
kleindienst
v.
mandel
as
necessarily
holding
that.
it
said
that
there
was
a
facially
legitimate
reason
for
that
particular
exclusion,
because
professor
mandel
had
violated
restrictions
on
his
visa,
in
past
entries.
and
that
that
was
a
sufficient
basis
to
uphold
the
denial
of
the
visa,
here,
and
to
override
any
first
amendment
claim
that
was
implicated
on
behalf
of
those
who
invited
him.
so,
i
cannot
say
that
we
can
read
kleindienst
v.
mandel
as
having
resolved
that
question
so
definitively,
with
respect,
i
have
to
say
that
is
slightly
overstated
in
that
dissenting
opinion.
the
reasons
given
in
these
affidavits
do
relate
to
specific
foreign
policy
concerns
and
we
have
summarized
them
briefly,
in
our
brief.
let
me
say
that
with
respect
to
those
who
would
be
entering
here,
as
representatives
of
an
organization
and
to
further
the
purposes
of
an
organization,
controlled
by
the
cuban
government,
the
reference
was
to
our
country's
policy
of
trying
to
diminish
the
disruptive
influence
of
the
cuban
government
in
latin
america,
that
is
detrimental
to
the
conduct
of
our
foreign
policy.
and
that
extending
hospitality
to
representatives
of
that
government
for
purposes
of
participating
in
discussions
in
the
united
states,
would
contribute
to
giving
that
government
an
aura
of
legitimacy,
that
would
enhance
that
government's
ability
to
undermine
our
foreign
policy
objectives,
in
central
america.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
did
not
need
the
court
and
we
were
not
the
one
who
invoked
the
court's
jurisdiction.
we
were
sued
in
this
case,
mr.
justice.
we
simply
denied
visas.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
the
state
department
thinks
that
it
is
detrimental,
has
concluded
that
it
would
be
detrimental
to
our
foreign
policy
to
extend
our
hospitality
to
that
person,
with
a
non-immigrant
visa.
and
that
that
was
within
the
authority
of
the
department
of
state
to
do.
with
respect
to
the
interior
minister
of
nicaragua,
rather
similar
reasons
were
given,
having
to
do
with
the
undermining
of
our
efforts
to
achieve
a
peaceful
settlement
of
hostilities
in
central
america,
should
we,
at
the
time,
extend
our
hospitality
to
the
interior
minister,
of
that
state,
to
which
we
were,
to
some
extent,
in
an
adversarial
relationship.
with
respect
to
mr.
pasti,
an
active
member
of
the
world
peace
council,
which
the
state
department
had
determined
to
be
a
soviet-controlled
organization,
at
the
time,
he
was
coming,
that
organization
was
engaged
in
a
vigorous
campaign
to
undermine
support
within
western
europe
for
the
deployment
of
american
missiles...
partly
through
a
campaign
of
disinformation,
that
is
elaborated
upon
in
an
attachment
to
one
of
undersecretary
eagleburger's
affidavits.
and
he
was
an
active
member,
coming
to
further
the
purposes
of
that
campaign
which
was
aimed
at
achieving
unilateral
disarmament,
to
the
extent
of
not
deploying
those
particular
missile
systems
in
europe.
and,
obviously,
extending
our
hospitality
to
him,
for
that
purpose,
would
have
a
tendency
to
encourage
that
organization's
efforts
and
contribute
to
its
esprit
for
that
purpose.
these
matters
change
over
time,
and
these
are
now
missiles
that
are
currently
the
subject
of
negotiation
between
the
soviet
union
and
ourselves,
for
the
possibility
of
some
mutual
withdrawal
of
the
missiles.
but
these
determinations
have
to
be
made
in
the
context
of
the
times,
in
which
they
actually
occur.
i
think
some
further
insight
into
the
problems
of
this
case,
can
be
had
by
looking
at
the
statistics
that
we
collected
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
in
the
footnote,
which
are
also
based
on
affidavit
in
this
record.
and
that
show,
in
the
20-year
period...
and
this
is
footnote
2,
on
page
6...
from
1963
to
1983,
consular
officers
issued
nearly
70
million
non-immigrant
visas,
and
denied
on
either
foreign
policy
or
internal
security
grounds,
under
subsection
27,
only
519
applications.
and
in
the
most
recent
times,
1981
through
1983,
6
to
7
million
per
year
have
been
granted,
an
average
of
less
than
30
have
been
denied.
this,
in
itself,
is
reflective
of
the
consistent
dominant
thrust
of
our
foreign
policy,
which
is
to
encourage
in
all
countries...
including
our
own
because
reciprocity
is
a
very
important
consideration
in
foreign
policy...
to
encourage
freedom
of
travel,
through
non-immigrant
visas,
and
indeed,
even
to
encourage
freedom
of
immigration.
it
is
a
policy
that
not
only
reflects
our
ideals
about
free
interchange
of
persons
and
ideas,
but
it
is
further
supported
from
the
likelihood
of
re-examination
by
the
very
practical
consideration
that,
in
our
country,
there
is
already
a
much
greater
diversity
of
views
being
expressed
than
is
true
in
many
countries.
and
it
would
not
be
to
our
ultimate
advantage,
overall,
to
be
opposing
travel
by
persons
who
might
express
diverse
views,
because
we
tend
to
benefit
much
more
from
additional
views
being
expressed
in
other
countries
through
travel,
than
that
it
would
be
at
all
practical
to
hope
to
monitor
the
expression
of
views
in
our
country.
we
do
not
know
what
these
70
million
people
might
say
when
they
arrive
here.
there
were
only
a
very
minute
number
of
people
that
we
had
reason
to
keep
out
because
of
foreign
policy
concerns
of
the
type
i
mention,
with
respect
to
these
particular
applicants.
we
have,
in
the
joint
appendix,
some
other
examples.
this
is
on
pages
111
to
114,
and
the
earliest
examples
that
became
known
of
the
use
of
denials
for
foreign
policy
reasons...
most
of
these
do
not
become
known
because
there
is
a
statutory
inhibition
on
public
disclosure
of
them...
but
these
were
three
examples
that,
indeed,
had
come
to
the
attention
of
congress.
one
was
a
denial
of
a
visa
to
a
mr.
liao,
a
proponent
of
an
independent
formosa.
and
another
was
a
denial
to
mr.
otto
skorzeny,
a
former
nazi
ss
officer.
and
the
objection
to
him
was
based
on
the
detrimental
foreign
policy
ramifications
of
granting
our
hospitality
to
him
regardless
of
any
particular
activities
that
he
might
be
planning
to
engage
in.
the
other
mentioned,
is
madame
nhu.
the
problems
that
the
state
department
is
faced
with,
have
to
do
with
factions
in
exile;
of
factions
that
may
be
engaged
in
armed
resistance
to

--certainly.
mr.

people
who
were
associated
with
the
nazi
regime,
during
the
thirties
and
world
war
ii,
but
it
does
not
cover
people
who
engaged
in
brutality
while
in
office,
in
other
countries
at
other
times,
and
there
are
many
such
people.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
perhaps
it
was
done
for
emphasis.
they
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
congress
thought
that
27
was
misapplied
with
respect
to
mr.
skorzeny,
and
we
have
taken
the
position
right
along,
that
we
can
apply
it
with
respect
to
others
who
have
engaged
in
physical
brutality,
which
are
not
embraced
while
in
office,
which
were
not
embraced
within
subsection
33.
there
have
been
deposed
governments
in
many
countries...
i
do
not
want
to
create
international
incidents
by
mentioning
some
of
them...
where
we
might
very
well
deny,
on
foreign
policy
grounds,
the
entry
of
these
persons.
and
this
has
not
been
disputed
by
the
other
side,
nor
do
they
deny
our
basic
proposition
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
activities
to
be,
in
themselves,
misconduct,
because
they
point
to
the
case
of
a
libyan,
young
person
denied
entry
to
study
aircraft
maintenance
and
engineering,
as
a
proper
example
of
the
use
of
subsection
27.
but
there
is
nothing
inherently
wrong
about
studying
that
and
certainly
having
a
willing
student
attends
one's
class
is
a
part
of
academic
freedom...
the
first
amendment
interests
are
implicated
in
such
a
case.
the
problem
is
the
detrimental
consequences
to
our
foreign
policy.
in
a
case
like
that,
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
non-prominent
person,
the
particular
nature
of
the
activities
looms
as
a
larger
consideration.
but
in
the
case
of
prominent
people,
such
as
are
involved
in
our
case,
what
really
looms
large
on
the
foreign
policy
call,
is
whether
extending
our
hospitality
to
them,
at
all,
is
going
to
be
detrimental
to
our
foreign
policy?
let
me
say
that
once
it
is
concluded,
as
we
submit,
that
subsection
27
authorizes
us
to
exclude
persons
on
these
grounds,
it
seems
clear
to
us,
that
the
mcgovern
amendment
is
not
meant
to
take
that
away.
it
says,
on
its
face,
that
it
applies
only
to
persons
otherwise
admissible
to
the
united
states.
and
the
legislative
history
we
have
recounted,
particularly
in
connection
with
an
amendment
to
the
mcgovern
amendment,
shows
that
it
has
always
been
understood
not
to
diminish
the
authority
that
we
had
under
subsection
27,
specifically,
the
chairman
of
the
house
foreign
relations
committee
made
that
point,
as
we
recounted
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
the
legislative
history
of
subsection
27
as
interchangeably
using
references
to
entry
and
activities
as
the
basis
of
concern,
and
that
is,
entirely
consistent
with
judge
harold
green's
saying
that
it
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference
in
this
context.
and,
that,
as
i
tried
to
relate
it
to
the
text,
that
the
thing
that
can
be
prejudicial
about
the
activities,
is
the
entry...
of
the
proposed
activities,
is
the
entry
or
presence
of
the
individual
who
is
seeking
the
visa.
that
is
the
thing
that
can
be
prejudicial
rather
than
anything
that
is
malum
and
say,
about
the
activities
that
is
our
reading
of
our
subsection
27
and
the
way
to
reconcile
it
with
the
repeated
entries,
repeated
reference
to
entry
or
presence
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision
and
its
predecessors.
the
affidavits,
in
this
case,
and
i
refer
the
court
to
joint
appendix
pages
59,
62,
and
89,
repeatedly
say
that
no
one
is
excluded
from
this
country
solely
because
his
views
are
critical
of
our
foreign
policy
views
or
in
any
way
to
deny
the
expression
of
points
of
view
to
the
american
people.
the
reason
that
one
looks
to
the
proposed
activities,
is
to
see
whether
they
come
within
the
narrow
class
for
which
we
would
admit
someone
without
extending
our
general
hospitality...
the
narrow
classes
that
i
tried
to
describe
to
you...
to
attend
a
meeting
of
the
un;
to
engage
in
bilateral
negotiations;
to
get
hospital
treatment,
etcetera.
we
can
allow
people
in
for
limited
purposes,
but
not
to
extend
our
general
hospitality
to
them.
my
time
has
expired.
