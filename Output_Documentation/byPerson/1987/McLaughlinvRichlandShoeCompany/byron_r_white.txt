justice
white
well,
with
that
word
"reliable
advice"
in
there,
how
can
he
ever
win
if
it
turns
out
the
court
decides
the
advice
was
not
reliable,
was
just
wrong?
justice
white
even
though
it
is
wrong.
justice
white
and
yet
you
say
you
can't
always
rely
on
a
lawyer's
advice.
justice
white
i
mean,
the
client
is
supposed
to
second
guess
the
lawyer?
justice
white
well,
he
hasn't
got
any
advice
at
all
about
his
case,
then.
justice
white
sort
of
a
negligence
standard.
right.
justice
white
well,
of
course,
the
jiffy
june
standard
is
even
an
odder
interpretation
of
the
word
"wilfull".
justice
white
and
the
secretary.
justice
white
suppose
the
secretary
was
responsible
for
urging
it
on
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
white
well,
he
is.
he
is
liable...
he
takes
the
risk
that
his
lawyer
is
wrong
for
two
years.
justice
white
well,
all
right.
justice
white
he
is
not
off
the
hook
just
because
he
gets
advice.
he
is
just
off
the
hook
if
he
gets
good
advice
for
the
third
year,
for
the
third
year
of
liability.
justice
white
if
we
agree
with
you
on
this
standard
that
you
propose,
what
do
we
do,
send
it
all
the
way
back
to
the
district
court?
justice
white
and
all
those
cases
are
wrong?
justice
white
but
nevertheless
all
wrong?
justice
white
are
there
a
lot
of
cases
out
there
that
will
have
to
be
done
over,
that
are
not
final?
justice
white
how
long
had
the
secretary
been
applying
the
jiffy
standard?
justice
white
that
was
the
case.
justice
white
yes,
but
he
must
have
been--
justice
white
--of
course,
it
was
a
construction
by
the
agency
charged
with
enforcing
this
statute.
it
was
a
construction
of
the
statute.
justice
white
so
i
suppose
you
have
to
say,
though,
there
just
isn't
any...
if
you
are
going
to
differ
with
the
sectetary's
or
reject
the
secretary's
original
position,
you
are
really
having
to
say
there
is
just
no
room
for
the
jiffy
june
standard
under
the
words
of
this
act.
justice
white
those
cases
that
rejected
it
were
after
thurston?
justice
white
when
were
the
court
of
appeals
opinions
that
rejected
the
jiffy
standard?
justice
white
okay.
