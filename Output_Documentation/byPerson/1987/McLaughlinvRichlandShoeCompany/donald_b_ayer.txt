mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
term
29
usc
section
255(a).
that
section
provides
that
an
action
may
be
brought
"within
two
years
after
the
cause
of
action
has
accrued
except
that
a
cause
of
action
arising
out
of
a
wilfull
violation
may
be
commenced
within
three
years.
"
this
action
was
brought
in
1984
by
the
secretary
of
labor
to
enjoin
further
overtime
pay
violations
and
to
compel
payment
of
overtime
accrued
during
the
prior
two
and
a
half
years.
it
was
brought
under
section
217
of
the
act
authorizing
equitable
relief,
so
there
is
in
this
case
no
question
of
the
availability
of
liquidated
damages.
we
are
simply
talking
here
about
compensatory
relief
and
injunctive
relief.
in
that
action
the
secretary
moved
for
summary
judgment
based
primarily
on
the
records
of
the
employer,
and
that
motion
was
granted
by
the
district
court.
the
court
first
rejected
the
defense
of
the
employer
that
his
behavior
his
conduct
was
justified
under
the
so-called
belo
plan
exception
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
section
207(f),
and
went
on
to
address
the
question
of
the
statute
of
limitations
provision.
the
court
rejected
the
contention
that
the
three-year
statute
of
limitations
was
inapplicable
here
on
the
ground
that
the
conduct
was
not
wilfull,
and
in
doing
so
it
applied
what
was
at
that
time
the
uniform
view
of
the
courts
of
appeals,
the
so-called
appreciable
possibility
test
first
adopted
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
jiffy
june
farms
case.
the
court
said
that
that
test
requires
only
an
awareness
of
the
possible
application
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
found
on
those
facts
that
the
vice
president
and
general
manager
had
made
clear
that
he
was
indeed
aware
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
and
that
that
act
does
govern
over
time
systems
of
compensation.
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
a
violation
and,
however,
reversed
with
regard
to
the
statute
of
limitations
question.
it
found
that
the
appreciable
possibility
test
was
inappropriate,
stating
primarily
the
reason
that
it
has
the
tendency
to
collapse
the
two
tiers
that
are
plainly
contemplated
on
the
face
of
the
statutory
provision,
the
two
tiers
of
liability,
two
years
versus
three
years,
because
in
virtually
every
case,
although
i
think
not
in
every
case,
an
employer
is
going
to
be
found
to
be
aware
of
an
appreciable
possibility
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
will
cover.
instead
of
the
at
that
point
established
appreciable
possibility
test,
the
court
applied
the
test
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
thurston
case,
where
it
dealt
not
with
this
statute,
but
rather
dealt
in
the
context
of
the
age
discrimination
employment
act's
section
dealing
with
liquidated
damages,
and
that
test
is
generally
articulated
as
requiring
a
knowledge
of
the
violation
or
reckless
disregard
for
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
the
conduct
is
in
fact
in
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
that
there...
the
answer
to
that
question
turns
upon
the
precise
application
given,
the
precise
interpretation
given
to
the
reckless
disregard
test,
and
our
concern
with
the
reckless
disregard
test
is
essentially...
it
is
not
with
the
part
that
talks
about
disregard.
it's
the
part
that
talks
about
reckless.
and
we
feel
that
the
term
"reckless
disregard"
as
it
is
used
generally
throughout
the
law
carries
with
it
a
connotation
of
outrageous
conduct,
a
connotation
of
highly
unreasonable
conduct,
and
that
if
you
read
that
connotation
into
the
thurston
test,
i
think
it
is
arguable
at
least...
i
think
it
is
unclear.
i
think
you
would
have
to
remand
to
get
the
determination
whether
we
meet
that
test
or
not.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
our...
the
answer
to
that,
i
think,
is
yes,
in
two
aspects.
number
one,
with
regard
to
overtime
that
everyone
agreed
had
to
be
paid
quite
apart
from
the
belo
plan
issue,
payments
were
not
made
anywhere
close
to
the
statutory
one
and
a
half
times
rate.
and
secondly,
there
are
four
requirements
for
this
belo
plan
requirement.
it
was
our
position
below
and
it
continues
to
be
that
none
of
the
four
were
met,
and
we
believe
that
in
those
two
respects
the
plan
is
indeed
outrageous
and
is
indeed--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--yes,
they
can.
they
can
be
sought
under
section
216.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
they
could
have
been
sought
had
the
action
been
brought
under
216
rather
than
217.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
we
think
that
in
the
context
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
there
is
strong
authority
that
liquidated
damages
are
themselves
not
punitive,
as
this
court
found
in
thurston
in
the
age
discrimination
act,
but
rather
are
compensatory.
the
court's
reasoning
in
the
thurston
case
finding
that
the
liquidated
damages
were
punitive
looked
to
the
legislative
history,
where
congress
had
substituted
in
essence
for
the
criminal
provision,
criminal
enforcement
provision
of
the
flsa
a
liquidated
damages
penalty
and
had
specifically
not
applied
the
liquidated
damages
provisions
of
the
flsa.
in
the
flsa,
the
authority
of
this
court,
the
overnight
transport
case
and
other
cases
have
explicitly
said
that
liquidated
damages
are
compensatory,
and
i
think
that
is
not
an
implausible
conclusion
when
you
consider
the
various
things
they
can
be
compensating
for:
number
one,
delay,
interest
that
accrues
on
something
that
is
unpaid
for
a
period
of
years;
number
two,
the
emotional
strain,
the
humiliation,
as
has
been
said
by
some
courts
that
results
in
the
context
of
a
denial
of
pay
to
which
you
are
legally
entitled;
and
number
three,
consequential
damages
of
whatever
sort
that
may
result
when
you
are
paid
as
your
salary
less
than
you
are
entitled
to
and
perhaps
at
a
rate
that
makes
it
difficult
to
live
in
the
way
that
you
are
accustomed
to
or
would
like
to.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
there
are
indeed
some
advantages,
but
i
think
the
approach
that
needs
to
be
taken
is
not
one
that
simply
says
there
are
some
advantages,
therefore
the
language
must
mean
the
same
thing,
but
is
rather
an
approach
much
like
the
one
this
court
took
in
thurston
of
looking
at
the
particular
statute,
looking
at
the
particular
context
in
which
the
words
appear,
and
deciding
whether
or
not...
what
the
precise
meaning
should
be.
in
this
situation
we
think
that
the
proper
standard
is
one
that
is
really
a
refinement
of
what
the
court
said
in
thurston,
a
refinement
in
the
sense
that
it
indeed
does
pay
attention
and
adopt
the
notion
of
disregard,
but
the
question
is,
disregard
of
what?
we
think
really
what
the
court
ought
to
do
in
the
context
of
the
statute
of
limitations
provision
is
start
with
the
question
of
whether
the
employer
was
aware
of
an
appreciable
possibility
that
his
conduct
might
not...
might
be
governed
by
the
statute,
that
is,
start
with
the
old
jiffy
june
appreciable
possibility
test,
but
go
on
beyond
that
test
and
ask
the
question,
what
does
the
employer
do
in
light
of
that
knowledge,
in
light
of
that
uncertainty,
and
does
he
act
in
a
way
that
is
reasonable
in
light
of
that.
we
think
what
the
employer
should
be
required
to
do
is,
when
he
has
that
uncertainty,
seek
and
get
reliable
assurances
that
his
conduct
is
in
fact
in
compliance
with
the
law,
and
if
he
doesn't
do
that
and
he
rather
proceeds
to
act
aware
that
he
may
be
violating
someone's
rights
to
minimum
wage
or
to
overtime
compensation,
then
he
should
be
made
to
bear
the
risk
of
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
reliable
in
the
sense
that
when
he
got
it
it
was
reasonable
to
rely
on
it.
that
is
what
we
mean
by
reliable.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
he
can't...
no,
if
he
goes
to
a
lawyer
and
the
lawyer
gives
an
opinion
which
on
its
face
appears
to
be
a
reasonably
reliable
statement
of
what
the
law
is
and
gives
him
basis
on
which
he
can
fairly
conclude
that
he
is--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
you
can't
always
rely
on
it.
for
example,
in
a
situation
where
the
lawyer--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
if
the
lawyer,
for
example,
assumes
hypothetical
facts
that
are
incorrect,
and
he
sends
you
a
letter
that
says,
assuming
situation
x,
then
the
law,
i
believe,
is
as
follows.
in
that
situation,
for
example--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
that's
right.
he
has
tried.
he
has
gone
to
a
lawyer.
but
he
hasn't
gotten
advice.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
okay,
well,
i
think
there
is
a
question
as
to
how
far...
as
to
how
reliable
it
has
to
be,
but
i
think
considering
this
you
have
got
to
bear
in
mind
what
is
at
stake.
we
are
not
talking
here
about
punishing
somebody.
we
are
only
talking
about
the
third
year
of
liability.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
am
saying...
no.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
no,
we
are
not.
we
are
saying
that
the
word
"wilfull"
means
wilfully
going
forward
knowing
of
a
significant
risk
that
you
are
not
complying
with
the
statute,
and
that
is
a
reasonable
approach.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
the
"wilfull"
here
i
think
focuses
on
proceeding
aware
of
the
risk,
and
the
reason--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
it
is
a
reasonable
approach
to
take
here,
because
you
have
to
look
at
the
consequence.
the
consequence
is
not
the
assessment
of
some
punitive
measure.
it
is
certainly
not
the
assessment
of
a
criminal
sanction.
it
is
rather
the
compulsion
to
pay
what
you
are
legally
required
to
pay
at
the
time
that
you
didn't
pay
it,
that
is,
during
the
third
year.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
it
did,
and
i
think
it
is
useful
to
look
at
the
context
in
which
it
put
those
words
into
the
statute
in
1966
and
to
compare
it
to
the
context
in
which
the
congress
acted
in
1967
in
the
age
act,
as
this
court
found
in
the
age
act,
it
was
a
substitution
for
the
criminal
provision
of
the
flsa
of
a
liquidated
damages
provision
which
was
to
be
punitive.
in
the
context
of
this
act,
which
was
amended
in
1966,
we
were
dealing
with
two
competing
policies.
the
purpose
of
the
fsla
amendments
in
1966
was
essentially
to
expand
coverage.
they
expanded
coverage
to
seven
million
additional
employees
and
to
700,000
additional
employers,
and
they
increased
the
minimum
wage,
and
did
a
number
of
other
things.
there
were
concerns
raised
at
that
time
about
the
effect
that
that
would
have,
these
new
and
suddenly
arising
obligations,
on
particularly
small
businesses,
and
some
restaurant
people
came
in
and
testified,
and
what
was
done
following
the
expression
of
those
concerns,
those
concerns
of
unanticipated
new
liabilities
on
small
entities
relatively
poorly
suited
to
deal
with
those
new
and
unanticipated
liabilities,
was
to
put
this
provision
into
the
statute,
modify
it
from
a
two-year
statute
of
to
a
two-year
provision
with
a
three-year
provision
for
wilfull
violations,
and
that
is
why,
that
precise
legislative
history
is
why
i,
think
our
view
makes
sense.
when
an
employer
goes
forward
aware
of
a
substantial
or
a
significant
risk,
that
what
he
is
doing
is
in
violation
of
the
law,
you
can't
say
that
that
risk
is
unanticipated.
it
is
fair
to
treat
his
conduct
as
wilfull
in
the
sense
that
he
is
going
forward
wilfully
aware
of
the
risk
that
is
being
incurred.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
we
don't
think
that
this
is
at
all
a
strange
concept
of
the
word
"wilfull"
in
the
context
of
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
word
"wilfull".
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
the
government's
position
has
been
up
until
the
filing
of
this
petition
that
the
jiffy
june
so-called
appreciable
possibility
test
is
the
law.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
the
d.c.
circuit
decision
in
the
laffey
case
in
1976
enunciated
something
very
close
to
it,
talking
about
where
an
employer
cognizant
of
an
appreciable
possibility
that
he
may
be
subject
to
the
statutory
requirements
fails
to
take
steps
reasonably
calculated
to
resolve
the
doubt.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it
is
very
close.
we
think
it
is
essentially
identical
to
the
d.c.
circuit.
and
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
question
of--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
we
agree
with
that.
our
position
is
that
the
jiffy
june
standard
has
significant
problems,
and
i
cannot
account
for
or
justify
the
course
of
development
under
which
the
fifth
circuit
initiated
it
and
other
courts
followed
it.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
it
has
two
problems.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
problems
that
we
have
with
it,
just
so
we
are
clear
as
to
why
we
are
departing
with
it,
are,
number
one,
it
tends
to
collapse
the
two
parts
of
the
statute,
the
two
parts
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
number
two,
maybe
even
more
seriously,
it
creates
a
disincentive
for
employers
to
go
out
and
get
good
advice
because
the
figure,
well,
i
am
going
to
be
wilfully
liable
no
matter
what
i
do,
so
why
don't
i
just
go
ahead
and
not
worry
about
it?
what
we
want
to
put
in
place,
what
we
want
to
adopt
is
the
laffey
standard,
which
puts
an
incentive
on
the
employer
to
get
good
advice.
it
tries
to
make
the
statute
work.
it
tries
to
get
the
employer
to
get
good
advice,
to
comply
with
the
statute,
and
when
he
takes
those
reasonable
steps
and
he
gets
reliable
assurances,
he
is
not
liable
for
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that
is
true
in
any
event.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that
is
true
in
any
event.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
right,
but
that
is
an
incentive
to...
that
is
some
incentive,
depending
on
how
much
money
is
at
stake,
to
get
him
to
comply
with
the
law,
and
that
is
good.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
would...
we
think
that
the
concept
of
negligence
is
really
a
concept
that
is
inappropriately
applied
here.
we
think
that
it
is
possible
that
an
employer
acts
non-negligently
in
getting
advice
that
says,
on
balance
we
think
your
conduct
is
probably
legal,
but
there
are
these
risks
and
this
possibility
that
you
may
not
be
acting
legally.
it
is
conceivable,
at
least,
that
that
is
not
negligent
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
go
ahead
in
the
face
of
that
advice.
we
would
say
that
nonetheless
under
this
wilfull
violation
standard
the
employer
should
be
treated
as
wilfully
violating
because
he
went
forward
knowing
that
there
was
a
significant
risk
that
he
was
going
to
be
violating
the
law,
and
we
are
not
talking...
again,
i
want
to
emphasize
we
are
not
talking
about
throwing
the
man
in
jail.
we
are
not
talking
about
assessing
a
punitive
sanction.
we
are
talking
about
whether
the
secretary
or
individual
employees
can
go
into
court
to
collect
what
they
were
legally
entitled
to
at
the
time
it
wasn't
paid.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
we
are
not
at
all
advocating
disregarding
the
word
"wilfull",
nor
are
we
advocating
disregarding
much
of
what
is
in
the
thurston
test.
we
are
talking
about
a
test
that
says
when
an
employer
goes
forward
with
conduct
in
disregard
of
his
knowledge
that
it
may
violate
the
law,
then
he
is
liable
for
the--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--no,
we
are
not
going
to
punish
him.
we
are
going
to
make
him
pay
what
he
was
legally
obligated
to
pay
before.
all
we
are
going
to
do--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--plus
maybe
double
damages,
but
double
damages
in
the
context
of
this
act
are
not
punitive,
they
are
compensatory,
and
this
court's
number
of
cases,
the
overnight
transport
case,
other
cases
have
said
specifically
that,
that
they
are
not
punitive.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
that
is
right,
and
so
to
follow--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
but
there
you
are
mixing
two
different
statutory
schemes.
in
the
context
of
the
tax
situation
it
is
obviously
true
that
when
a
taxpayer
doesn't
pay
the
tax,
and
he
has
some
thought
that
he
may
be
making
a
mistake
or
he
may
be
doing
something
wrong,
he
has
to
pay
the
tax.
all
we
are
saying
is--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--this
court
has
addressed
that
in
a
number
of
cases
as
to
what
wilfull
means
in
the
context
of
the
tax
laws,
criminal
sections,
the
ones
i
am
thinking
of,
and
that
is
a
different
context
than
the
notion
that
the
word
"wilfull"
has
to
mean
the
same
thing
throughout
federal
law
is
one
that
is
contradicted
in
almost
every
single
case
this
court
has
written
dealing
with
that
word.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
that's
true.
under
the
wage
and
hour
laws
there
is
a
specific
provision
of
section
259
where
you
can
go
to
the
labor
department
and
you
can
get
advice,
and
if
you
get
a
definitive
ruling,
you
not
only
are
not
wilfull
but
you
are
not
liable
for
the
unpaid
overtime
or
minimum
wage
at
all.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
he
was
supposed
to.
in
fact,
footnote
a
of
our
brief
indicates
clearly
that
he
did
not
pay
anything
close
to
time
and
a
half
for
the
overtime
over
48
hours.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that
he
should
have
paid.
he
in
fact
did
not
pay.
if
you
read
that
footnote
a
it
talks
about
several...
they
were
only
talking
about
seven
mechanics
here.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
and
as
to
a
number
of
them
we
discuss
there
the
fact
that
the
employer
was
paying
an
hourly
rate
as
you
calculate
it
that
was
not
only
not
time
and
a
half,
it
was
not
even
the
minimum
wage
of
$3.35.
so
that
there
is
no
question,
i
think,
but
that
with
regard
to
the
overtime
that
everyone
agrees
had
to
be
paid,
quite
apart
from
this
belo
plan,
if
we
approve
the
belo
plan,
they
still
had
to
pay
overtime
above
the
48-hour
regular
week,
and
as
to
several
of
these
employees,
they
were
not
paying
anything
that
resembled
not
only
overtime,
it
didn't
even
resemble
their
base
regular
wage.
it
was
way
below
it.
so
that
in
that
sense
i
think
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
is
that
this
is
indeed
something
that
would
meet,
should
meet
on
a
full
assessment
of
the
facts
by
the
district
court
the
conclusion
that
they
were
in
disregard
of
the
law.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
you
remand
to
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
had
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
application
of
its
standard,
of
the
thurston
standard,
and
the
reason
that
we
brought
this
case
to
you
now
is
that
we
have
this
sharp
split
in
the
circuits.
we
have
four
circuits
that
have
adopted
the
thurston
test
under
255(a)
under
the
statute
of
limitations.
we
have
five
since
thurston
that
have
applied
the
jiffy
june
test,
and
so
you
have
the
sharpest
of
splits
in
the
circuits,
plus
you
have
three
other
circuits
that
apply
different
standards.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
we
think
that
the
first
nine,
that
the
four
that
have
applied
thurston
and
the
five
that
have
applied
jiffy
june
are
poles,
and
we
are
in
the
middle.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
they
are
incorrect.
we
think
they
are
not
the
most
appropriate
reading
of
this
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
there
are,
i
think,
a
fairly
large
number
of
enforcement
actions
at
various
stages
along
the
way,
and
i
think
a
change
in
the
law
would
allow
them
to
be
corrected
at
various
stages.
we
are
only
talking
about
an
assessment...
we
are
not
talking
about
the
basic
assessment
of
liability.
we
are
talking
about
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
violation
itself
is
wilfull
or
not
as
to
the
third
year.
now,
one
thing
i
would
like
to
say
in
answer
to
that
is
that
the
reason
we
are
here
is
also
because
this
really
matters.
there
are,
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
an
enormous
number
of
cases
brought
under
this
statute.
it
takes
a
significant
time
in
order
to,
number
one,
get
a
report
of
a
possible
violation,
number
two,
to
investigate
the
violation,
number
three,
if
you
find
a
violation
that
you
want
to
enforce
to
try
to
settle
the
violation.
if
you
can't
settle
the
violation,
you
then
refer
it
to
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
or
to
a
lawyer
to
prosecute.
all
of
that
takes
time,
so
that
these
cases
are
being
brought
at
a
time
when
not
infrequently
in
fact
quite
commonly
there
is
liability
that
is
more
than
two
years
old,
and
so
we
are
talking
about
impairing
the
enforcement
scheme
of
this
act.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
it
was,
i
think,
in
1973
is
when
jiffy
june
was
decided.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that
was
the
case.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
don't
know
precisely
what
the
secretary
was
urging
between
1966,
when
this
was
enacted,
and
1973,
when
jiffy
june
was
decided.
i
do
know,
i
think,
that
when
jiffy
june
was
decided,
and
up
until
thurston,
it
was
the
uniform
position
of
all
the
courts
of
appeals
that
decided
it
that
the
appreciable
possibility
test
was
the
law,
and
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
apply
a
rule
that
is
more
liberal
for
employers
than
that
test,
which
was
the
uniform
interpretation
for
a
period
of,
what,
12
years.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
that's
correct.
i
would
say
it
a
different
way.
i
would
say
that
both
it
and
the
reckless
disregard
thurston
test
need
refinement
to
be
appropriate
in
this
context.
we
are
borrowing
the
jiffy
june
test
as
the
first
step
of
our
test.
we
think
you
first
ask,
does
the
employer
have
an
appreciable
knowledge
of
an
appreciable
possibility?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
we
certainly
don't
mean
to
suggest
that.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
what
must
be
willed--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--what
must
be
willed
is
conduct
in
the
face
of
a
known
risk.
that
is
what
must
be
willed.
and
we
think
that
that
is
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute,
given
its
history,
because
the
concern
at
the
time
it
was
enacted
was
for
unanticipated
economic
burdens
on
small
business.
they
are
not
unanticipated.
they
are
known.
the
risks
are
known
at
the
time
the
action
is
taken.
and
that
is
why--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
we
get
it
out
of
the
word
"wilfull",
and
the
only
thing
i
would
like
to
add
before
i
sit
down
and
try
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
is,
our
reading
of
the
word
"wilfull"
is
well
within
the
mainstream
of
words...
of
readings
of
that
word
as
this
court
has
used
it.
indeed,
in
the
illinois
central
case,
which
this
court
cited
approvingly
in
thurston,
you
are
dealing
there
with
a
concept
of
disregard.
there
it
was
an
instance
of
failing
to
unload
a
cattle
car
within
36
hours
because
some
employee
forgot
to
unload
the
car,
and
that
conduct
was
found
wilfull,
and
this
court
said
in
thurston,
that's
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
word
"wilfull".
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
it
is
hard
to
say,
i
think,
precisely
whether
that
is
right
or
not.
we
think
that
the
nolting
case
in
the
eighth
circuit,
which
we
have
cited,
and
the
donovan
case
in
the
sixth
circuit,
they
are
not
identical
to
the
laffey
case,
but
they
are
certainly
somewhere
between
thurston
and
jiffy
june,
appreciable
possibility,
and
we
think
they
give
some
support
to
the
position
that
we
are
advocating.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
make
one
point
about
the
extent
to
which
the
statute
of
limitations
provision
in
fact
governs
the
recoverability
of
liquidated
damages
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
earlier
question.
i
have
already
said
that
it
is
our
view
and
i
think
it
is
the
court's
historical
view
that
liquidated
damages
under
the
flsa
are
compensatory,
not
punitive.
the
other
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
only
in
a
very
partial
and
somewhat
peculiar
sense
does
the
statute
of
limitations
control
the
recoverability
of
liquidated
damages,
and
i
say
that
because
of
the
section
260
provision
that
essentially
governs
whether
or
not
an
employer
is
going
to
be
able
to
avoid
the
payment
of
liquidated
damages.
that
provision
says
that
the
employer
can
come
in
and
show
a
reasonable
basis
for...
a
good
faith
reasonable
basis
for
believing
his
action
was
legal,
and
then
within
the
court's
discretion
the
court
may
decide
to
award
no
liquidated
damages
if
it
doesn't
want
to,
so
that
it
is
only
in
the
sense
of
avoiding
considering
that
section
260
that
the
statute
of
limitations
controls
the
availability
of
liquidated
damages.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
