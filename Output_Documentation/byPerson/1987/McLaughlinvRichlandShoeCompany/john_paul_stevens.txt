justice
stevens
mr.
ayer,
under
your
test
of
a
significant
risk
of
a
violation
when
you
take
action,
i
suppose
everybody
who
files
an
income
tax
return
is
at
significant
risk
that
he
has
made
an
error.
justice
stevens
and
so
is
every
error
a
wilfull
failure
to
pay?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
if
he
does...
if
he
files
an
incorrect
return
wilfully,
he
has
a
more
serious
consequence.
justice
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
even
under
the
wage
and
hour
laws
there
are
some
rather
complicated
regulatory
provisions
where
a
person
can
take
a
significant
risk
even,
you
know,
unless
he
gets
a
pretty
skilled
lawyer
on
the
proposition?
there
have
been
all
sorts
of
significant
risks
of
violation
in
the
federal--
justice
stevens
--this
man
paid
a
weekly
wage
based
on
48
hours
of
work,
didn't
he,
and
then
he
paid
time
and
a
half,
he
averaged
that
out
and
paid
time
and
a
half
on
the--
justice
stevens
--but
if
the
average
wages
for
the
48
hours
had
been
the
proper
regular
wage,
then
it
was
time
and
a
half
over
that,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
fair
labor
standards
act
requires
that
a
civil
enforcement
action
be
commenced
within
two
years
after
the
cause
of
action
accrued
unless
the
violation
was
willful
in
which
event
the
statute
of
limitations
is
three
years.
there's
a
conflict
among
the
courts
of
appeals
as
to
the
proper
meaning
of
the
word,
“proper
standard”
to
use
in
interpreting
the
word
“willful”.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
resolved
that
conflict
by
agreeing
with
the
approach
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
and
affirm
its
judgment
in
this
case.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justice
brennan
and
justice
blackmun.
