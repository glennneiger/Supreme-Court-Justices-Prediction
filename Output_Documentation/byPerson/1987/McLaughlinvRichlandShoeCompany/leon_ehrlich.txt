mr.
leon
ehrlich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
that
the
petitioner
has
stated
something
that
is
not
entirely
correct
when
he
stated
that
the
jiffy
june
case
was
uniform.
i
refer
the
court
respectfully
to
the
footnote,
footnote
9
at
page
16
of
the
amicus
brief,
in
which
that
same
issue
was
addressed,
and
amicus
states
in
its
brief
at
page
38
the
government
erroneously
called
the
jiffy
june
standard
a
majority
rule.
in
fact,
only
the
first,
fourth,
and
tenth
circuits
have
adopted
the
rule.
four
other
circuits,
however,
have
clearly
rejected
the
jiffy
june
standard.
i
believe
that
the
crux--
mr.
leon
ehrlich
--after
jiffy
june?
or
after
the
thurston?
mr.
leon
ehrlich
the
peters
shreveport
case,
1987.
the
brock
case,
of
course.
walton
versus
consumers
union,
1986.
mr.
leon
ehrlich
i
believe
that
the
petitioner's
case
rests
upon
the
allegation
that
the
conduct
would
be
wilfull
if
done
in
the
face
of
a
known
risk.
i
think
that
is
a
fairly
close
summary
of
what
was
stated.
however,
one
thread
through
the
petitioner's
brief
and
reply
brief
is
the
reference,
and
reference
was
made
here,
to
the
employer's
uncertainties.
at
page
30
of
the
brief,
they
state
"employers
should
bear
the
burden
of
a
third
year
of
liability
when
they
engage
in
pay
practices
without
resolving
legal
uncertainties.
"
and
in
the
reply
brief
at
page
7,
"only
where
an
employer
faces
uncertainty
about
compliance
with
the
flsa
need
reasonable
inquiry
or
other
steps
be
taken
to
avoid
a
wilfullness
finding.
"
if
any
part
of
this
case
can
be
stated
with
absolute
certainty,
it
is
that
the
respondent
never
experienced
uncertainty
about
its
pay
practices.
the
respondent
believed
that
it
was
dealing
fairly,
generously,
and
in
compliance
with
the
law
in
its
salary
arrangement
with
the
mechanics,
so
if
for
no
other
reason
we
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
no
wilfullness
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
can
be
found,
and
the
respondent
should
be
relieved
of
any
further
obligation.
i
think
it
would
be
a
travesty
were
this
case
to
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
in
the
light
of
the
testimony
that
has
been
adduced.
it
was
the
respondent
that
submitted
to
the
petitioner
all
the
information
that
was
requested.
the
petitioner
limited
its
inquiry
based
on
the
jiffy
june
doctrine.
once
they
found
out
from
the
general
manager
that
he
was
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
act,
they
said,
fine,
we
have
got
you,
and
now
have
us
go
back,
i
think
it
would
be
a
travesty
considering
the
total
amount
of
money
involved.
mr.
leon
ehrlich
approximately
$4,000.
mr.
leon
ehrlich
that
is
a
correct
statement,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
ehrlich
i
think
that
that
should
not
be
done.
mr.
leon
ehrlich
i
am
here
supporting
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
insofar
as
it
rejects
the
contention
of
liability.
i
am
contending--
mr.
leon
ehrlich
--that
it
should
not
go
back.
mr.
leon
ehrlich
may
it
please
the
court,
considering
the
amount
of
money
involved
in
this
case,
we
felt
that
it
just
didn't
justify
additional
costs,
and
we
felt
that
if
we
came--
mr.
leon
ehrlich
--i
believe
that
i
can
rightly
argue
it
for
the
same
reason
that
the
petitioner
is
arguing
a
theory
not
advanced
in
either
the
district
court
nor
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
believe
that
this
case
should
not
have
been
granted
certiorari
because
the
issue
here
is
one
that
is
really
seeking
an
advisory
opinion.
the
petitioner
is
interested
in
resolving
what
it
concedes
to
be
a
conflict,
and
so
they
drag
us
into
this
court,
but
the
case
that
was
presented
in
both
courts
below
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
being
argued
here.
and
we
feel
that
if
we
are
here,
we
might
as
well
let
the
court
know
our
entire
feelings.
petitioner
asserts
at
page
44
of
its
brief
that
it
is
hard
to
imagine
how
the
plan
could
have
been
the
product
of
good
faith
reliance
on
sound
assurances
of
the
plan's
legality.
we
suggest
that
it
is
not
hard
and
that
no
imagination
is
required
to
establish
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
respondent.
the
records
of
the
respondent
show
that
the
total
compensation
received
by
these
mechanics,
the
initial
compensation
was
almost
double
the
minimum
wage,
and
though
not
required
to
do
so,
the
respondent
paid
these
mechanics
for
vacation,
though
not
required
to
pay
it.
they
paid
for
holidays.
they
paid
insurance.
and
they
paid
a
bonus.
when
all
those
figures
are
added
up,
they
are
greatly
in
excess
of
what
a
technical
belo
contract
would
have
required.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
appendix,
there
is
a
reference
in
the
deposition
that
one
mechanic
while
receiving
disability
pay
for
which
the
employer
had
paid
was
also
paid
his
full
salary
for
14
weeks.
now,
if
that
is
the
kind
of
conduct
that
shows
wilfullness,
then
there
is
a
total
distortion
of
that
term.
mr.
leon
ehrlich
it
would
be
wilfull--
mr.
leon
ehrlich
--beg
pardon?
mr.
leon
ehrlich
may
it
please
your
honor,
we
are
dealing
with
all
the
mechanics.
all
the
people
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
seven,
are
all
mechanics.
we
are
not
dealing
with
anyone
else.
they
were
all
treated
the
same
way.
mr.
leon
ehrlich
oh,
all
of
them
were.
all
of
them
were
given
bonuses,
holiday
pay,
vacation
pay.
mr.
leon
ehrlich
all
of
them.
and
as
to
intention,
the
depositions
make
it
clear
that
the
respondent
was
using
the
department
of
labor
coefficient
table,
albeit
incorrectly,
it
turns
out,
but
they
were
using
that
coefficient
table
showing
that
they
were
intending
to
comply
with
the
law.
mr.
leon
ehrlich
can
i
not
argue,
then,
that
this
case
still
resolves
a
request
for
an
advisory
opinion
and
then
as
a
matter
of
law
determined
that
under
these
facts
there
is
nothing
to
go
back?
mr.
leon
ehrlich
okay.
we
propose,
however,
that
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
is
an
appropriate
one
as
to
the
application
of
the
law.
but
i
think
if
it
goes
back
and
is
remanded
it
should
go
back
and
we
respectfully
submit
and
suggest
that
it
go
back
with
instructions
as
to
what
should
be
looked
for.
first,
we
think
that
the
term
"wilfull"
should
be
taken
in
its
ordinary
sense,
as
the
circuit
court
held,
meaning
a
deliberate,
intentional
act.
with
some
variations,
the
petitioner
has
advanced
a
test
for
determining
wilfullness
set
out
in
its
brief
at
page
13
as
follows:
"we
think
an
employer's
unlawful
pay
practices
should
be
found
wilfull
for
purposes
of
the
flsa's
limitation
provision
when
the
employer
is
aware
of
the
potential
application
of
the
flsa
but
pursued
the
pay
practices
without
reliable
assurances
of
their
legality,
and
then
in
the
same
vein
in
the
reply
brief
that
a
wilfull
violation
would
exist
where
an
employer
is
aware
of
the
flsa
applicability
and
fails
to
take
steps
to
determine
the
statute's
demands,
or
having
taken
such
steps
do
not
secure
a
reasonable
basis
for
eliminating
uncertainties
about
their
compliance.
"
as
i
believe
was
evident
from
some
of
the
questions
the
petitioner
offers
amnesty
only
to
those
who
sought
reliable
or
reasonable
advice
on
their
legal
obligation,
and
there
is
no
definition
of
what
the
petitioner
conceives
to
be
reliable
or
reasonable.
it
could
very
likely
be
only
that
which
or
who
agree
with
petitioner's
views.
would
the
petitioner,
for
example,
find
that
this
respondent,
relying
on
my
advice,
would
not
have
acted
properly
because
my
advice
might
not
have
been
considered
reliable
since
i
had
disagreed
with
the
jiffy
june
decision?
isn't
that
what
an
employee
would
be
faced
with?
or,
is
the
reliability
of
advice
to
be
determined
by
a
martindale
hubbell
listing?
it
just
boggles
the
mind
that
this
is
what
the
government
conceives
to
be
an
appropriate
substitute
for
the
jiffy
june
standard.
and
what
comfort
or
security
can
the
respondent
and
others
derive
as
to
what
would
be
the
definition
considering
again
that
the
jiffy
june
argument
was
espoused
in
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals?
meeting
those
tests,
the
three
criteria,
we
admit
the
respondent
knew
that
the
act
applied.
as
to
the
second,
we
submit,
as
i
stated
before,
that
they
used
the
coefficient
table,
albeit
improperly,
and
we
further
say
that
the
final
criteria
called
for
by
petitioner
of
reliability
and
reasonableness
is
unrealistic
and
onerous.
it
would
mean
that
every
employer
before
doing
anything
would
have
to
seek
a
legal
opinion
on
any
action
he
took.
we
have
got
to
remember
that
my
client
is
a
small
business.
they
don't
have
house
counsel.
they
can't
afford
to
have
everything
run
through
attorneys.
but
more
unsettling
is
the
fact
that
after
that
legal
opinion
would
have
been
secured
there
is
no
assurance
that
the
government
would
still
say,
you
done
a
reasonable
thing,
what
you
are
doing
is
not
wilfull.
they
would
sit
in
judgment
on
the
advice
given
the
client.
that
is
an
horrendous
suggestion.
if
we
are
talking
about
reasonableness
and
since
the
petitioner
now
espouses
that
theory,
let
us
look
at
what
the
conduct
of
the
petitioner
has
been.
how
reasonable
has
its
conduct
been?
first,
and
it
was
mentioned
in
the
argument,
wilfullness
requirement
of
the
flsa
statute
of
limitations
provision
the
petitioner
states
is
designed
to
protect
certain
employers
from
unanticipated
liability
rather
than
to
punish.
nothing
in
the
record
indicates
that
my
client
anticipated
this
liability,
and
nothing
in
the
record
shows
any
recklessness.
so
if
we
use
that
test,
my
client
is
home
free.
they
never
anticipated
this
liability.
is
it
reasonable
to
believe
that
my
client
established
some
contingent
fund
to
take
care
of
this?
if
they
did
that
would
be
an
act
evidencing
wilfullness.
i
believe
mention
was
made
of
uniformity
of
construction.
and
the
second
circuit
court
in
the
case
of
rousseau
versus
trafari
pointed
out,
"we
believe
that
wilfull
should
have
but
a
single
meaning
within
the
ada,
and
that
therefore
the
thurston
definition
applies.
"
"construing
identical
language
in
a
single
statute
in
pari
materia
is
both
traditional
and
logical.
"
"moreover,
a
single
meaning
avoids
potential
jury
confusion
resulting
from
different
instructions.
"
and
concerning
the
same
word,
the
petitioner
argued
in
support
of
that
theory
in
the
thurston
case,
and
yet
in
the
brief
here
it
would
appear
that
the
petitioner
denies
any
need
for
uniformity.
i
on
that
subject
point
out
to
one
other
fact,
that
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
there
was
an
admission
that
the
federal
government
itself
has
taken
different
positions
on
the
proper
interpretation
of
wilfull
violation
as
used
in
the
flsa
statute
of
limitations.
that
certainly
doesn't
give
anyone
assurance.
the
reference
to
that
is
in
its
petition
at
page
11.
the
allegation
then
is
made
that
the
history
of
the
act
suggests
that
the
standard
of
wilfullness
was
to
allow
employees
and
the
department
of
labor
needed
additional
time
to
challenge
unlawful
pay
practices,
and
the
circuit
court
discussing
the
issue
of
punitiveness
rejects
the
petitioner's
position
and
states
that
more
time
is
needed,
that
more
time
is
needed
by
saying
it
is
neither
more
difficult
to
detect
nor
more
severe
than
it
would
be
were
the
violations
not
wilfull.
and
today
again
the
petitioner
acknowledges,
as
it
did
in
its
brief,
that
the
in
re
picture
standard
threatens
to
collapse
the
two-tiered
scheme
envisaged
by
congress
into
a
one-tiered
scheme.
when
did
they
first
became
aware
of
that
obvious
fact,
and
why
did
they
subject
us
to
this
litigation?
i
think
the
most
bizarre
of
the
petitioner's
case
rests
in
its
proposal
in
its
brief
at
page
45,
when
the
petitioner
states,
"respondent
should
be
afforded
an
opportunity
to
present
new
evidence,
including
evidence
of
any
efforts
it
undertook
to
secure
reliable
assurances
that
its
pay
practices
complied
with
the
flsa.
"
"if
respondent
acknowledges
in
this
court
that
there
is
no
such
evidence,
this
court
should
order
affirmance
of
the
district
court
judgment.
"
"otherwise,
the
case
should
be
returned
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
on
the
third
year
of
back
pay
liability.
"
is
that
considered
a
reasonable
approach?
if
this
were
an
appropriate
choice,
and
we
dispute
it,
why
wasn't
it
advanced
previously?
why
wasn't
that
alternative
given
to
the
respondent?
we
submit
that
the
alternatives
offered
the
respondent
are
not
properly
stated.
if
i
may
paraphrase,
i
would
say
it
would
be
more
reasonable
for
me
since
the
petitioner
does
have
the
burden
of
proving
wilfullness
to
state
to
the
petitioner,
if
petitioner
acknowledges
in
this
court
that
it
has
no
further
evidence
of
wilfullness
than
it
has
to
date,
despite
what
was
said
in
answer
to
a
question,
this
court
should
order
affirmance
of
the
circuit
court
judgment
and
further
hold
that
as
a
matter
of
law
based
on
the
evidence
already
in
the
picture
respondent
has
no
liability
for
the
third
year.
and
then
what
was
said
here,
the
observation
that
the
petitioner's
standard
be
viewed
at
most
as
a
variation
on
thurston's
standard,
and
that
thurston
need
not
be
read
as
substantially
different
from
the
petitioner's
prose
standard,
i
would
suggest
smacks
more
of
salesmanship
than
accurate
observation.
the
standard
now
proposed,
asserts
the
petitioner,
was
always
a
possible
resolution
as
this
case
progressed.
if
that
were
really
the
case,
i
would
submit
respectfully
that
it
was
the
most
carefully
hidden
secret
in
washington.
and
then,
in
the
reply
brief,
the
petitioner
attempts
to
allay
the
fear
of
the
respondent
that
there
is
no
significant
danger
that
wilfullness
disputes
will
center
on
whether
an
attorney's
advice
if
relied
upon
is
reasonable.
the
requirement,
continues
the
petitioner,
means
only
that
a
court
must
examine
the
advice
as
one
factor
in
determining
the
issue.
won't
the
petitioner
examine
that
advice
initially,
at
the
outset,
before
it
becomes
a
court
case?
and
what
does
one
factor
mean,
25
percent,
50
percent,
75
percent?
we
have
no
assurance
on
what
a
person
in
the
position
of
the
respondent
can
expect?
we
submit
that
this
court
in
thurston
has
already
determined
the
meaning
of
wilfull,
that
it
is
a
knowing
or
a
reckless
disregard,
and
contrariwise
the
petitioner
can
point
to
no
decision
of
this
court
to
support
the
definition
now
urged,
nor
can
it
point
to
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
would
show
a
reckless
disregard.
the
petitioner
seeks
to
distinguish
the
standard
in
this
case
and
thurston
on
the
ground
that
thurston
dealt
with
liquidated
damages
rather
than
the
statute
of
limitations.
we
submit
that
the
reasoning
in
thurston
is
equally
applicable
here.
the
end
result
of
what
is
urged
if
a
third
year
of
liability
is
found
to
exist
is
added
money
paid
out
for
a
violation
of
a
statute.
that
is
punitive.
the
fact
that
it
is
called
something
else
doesn't
mean
any
less
as
far
as
the
employer,
the
respondent
is
concerned.
it
means
paying
out
money
for
having
done
something
conceived
subsequently
to
be
wrong.
we
submit
that
on
the
record
as
it
stands
now,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
respondent
did
anything
improper,
anything
wilfull,
anything
other
than
a
reasonable
and
responsible
business
would
do.
we
ask
that
this
court
reject
the
contention
of
the
