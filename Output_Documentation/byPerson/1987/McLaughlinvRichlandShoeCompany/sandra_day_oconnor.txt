justice
o'connor
mr.
ayer,
do
you
think
that
the
government's
proof
could
have
met
that
reckless
disregard
standard
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
well,
in
your
position
is
the
evidence
sufficient
to
meet
that
standard?
justice
o'connor
now,
under
the
federal
fair
labor
standards
act,
liquidated
damages
can
be
sought
for
a
violation,
can't
they?
justice
o'connor
and
could
they
have
been
sought
here?
justice
o'connor
and
what
standard
should
be
applied
for
a
violation
if
liquidated
damages
are
sought
under
this
act?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
wonder
if
there
aren't
some
advantages
to
having
a
more
uniform
test
of
what
is
meant
by
wilfull,
whether
it
appears
in
this
statute
or
another
one.
justice
o'connor
plus
maybe
double
damages
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
o'connor
mr.
ayer,
i
take
it
no
court
of
appeals
has
applied
the
laffey
standard
since
the
thurston
case
came
down.
justice
o'connor
mr.
ehrlich--
justice
o'connor
--mr.
ehrlich,
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
decision
below
has
remanded
it
to
the
district
court
to
apply
its
standard.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
that
shouldn't
be
done?
justice
o'connor
so
you
are
not
here
supporting
the
judgment
of
the
court
below?
justice
o'connor
well,
did
you
cross--
justice
o'connor
--did
you
cross
petition
to
this
court?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
you
didn't
cross
petition
i
don't
know
how
you
can
argue
what
you
are
arguing,
if
i
may
say
so.
you
either
have
to
argue
in
support
of
the
judgment
below
or--
