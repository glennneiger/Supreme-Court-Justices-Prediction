chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
today
in
number
86-1520,
ann
mclaughlin,
secretary
of
labor,
versus
the
richland
shoe
company.
mr.
ayer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
has
got
a
poor
opinion.
he
might
have
asked
a
lawyer
about
a
tort
case,
and
you
say
he
can't
rely
on
that
advice
in
this
case.
i
go
with
that.
that
is
very
reasonable.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
can
always
phrase
the
wilfull,
wilfully
going
forward
and
doing
a
negligent
act.
i
mean,
you
can
always
end
up
with
kind
of
a
negligence
standard
even
though
you
start
out
with
the
word
"wilfull",
because
some
part
of
your
act
is
always
volitional.
you
will
to
do
something.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
just
an
ordinary
negligence
standard,
being
aware
of
the
risk,
isn't
it?
a
reasonable
man
knows
that
there
is
a
risk.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
congress
obviously
wanted
to
distinguish
in
some
way
between
the
duty
to
pay
for
two
years
and
the
duty
to
add
on
a
third
year.
it
wanted
a
heightened
level
there.
chief
justice
rehnquist
isn't
that
essentially
a
question
for
congress?
i
mean,
this
would
have
been
a
very
good
argument
to
make
to
congress
when
it
was
drafting
this
section,
saying
we
are
not
talking
about...
don't
put
the
word
"wilfull"
in.
but
to
say,
now
that
congress
has
put
the
word
"wilfull"
in,
that
this
really
isn't
all
that
bad
so
we
should
disregard
the
word
"wilfull"--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--you
are
not
going
to
punish
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ayer.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
ehrlich.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
ehrlich,
we
don't
ordinarily
decide
evidentiary
questions
here.
the
third
circuit,
which
ruled
in
your
favor
on
the
standard,
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
for
further
hearings,
and
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
you
didn't
cross
petition
for
certiorari.
so
the
best
result
you
are
going
to
get
here
is
an
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
means
the
case
goes
back.
all
we
are
interested
here
is
the
proper
standard
which
the
district
court
should
apply
when
the
case
does
go
back.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
can
only
speak
for
myself.
i
think
there
is
very
little
to
be
said
for
that
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ehrlich.
mr.
ayer,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ayer.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-1520,
mclaughlin
versus
richland
shoe
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
