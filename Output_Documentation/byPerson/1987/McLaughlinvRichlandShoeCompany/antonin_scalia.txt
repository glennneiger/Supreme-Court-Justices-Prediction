justice
scalia
no,
but
you
are
saving
that
the
word
"wilfull"
in
the
statute
means
unreasonable,
right?
justice
scalia
mr.
ayer,
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
that
congress,
although
it
has
a
particular
problem
in
mind,
adopts
language
that
entirely
solves
that
problem
but
also
solves
some
other
problems
as
well
or
extends
to
some
situations
other
than
that
problem.
what
you
are
urging
upon
us
is
a
very
strange
interpretation
of
the
word
"wilfull"
based
upon
the
principle
that
we
should
scrutinize
legislative
history
and
be
sure
that
the
only
thing
the
statute
covers
is
what
you
find
in
the
legislative
history
as
the
primary,
and
as
far
as
we
know
the
exclusive
concern
of
the
congress.
that
is
a
very
strange
principle
of
statutory
construction.
justice
scalia
it
took
you
a
long
time
to
come
up
with
it.
below
you
were
just
going
with
jiffy
june
in
its
original
version,
weren't
you?
justice
scalia
has
anybody
ever
thought
of
this
meaning
of
wilfull
before?
justice
scalia
where
does
it
exist,
and
what
is--
justice
scalia
and
so
long
as
he
is
not
neligent
in
accepting
the
advice,
in
which
case
if
he
is
negligent
he
is
wilfull.
justice
scalia
mr.
ayer,
i
understand
that
wilfull
leaves
some
problems,
and
that
the
cases
you
cite
on
page
16
of
your
brief,
but
those
problems
always
relate
to
what
has
to
be
willed.
is
it
just
the
act
that
has
to
be
conscious
and
wilfull,
or
need
the
defendant
in
the
case
have
to
will
the
violation
of
the
law?
that
is
an
understandable
ambiguity.
i
don't
see
how
your
interpretation
of
the
word
has
anything
to
do
with
that
kind
of
an
ambiguity.
how
is
yours
based
on
what
it
is
that
must
be
willed?
i
mean,
the
fact
that
a
word
is
ambiguous
in
some
respects
doesn't
mean
that
it
is
just
an
empty
bottle
and
you
can
give
it
any
meaning
you
want.
justice
scalia
what
is
it
that
must
be
willed--
justice
scalia
--and
therefore
must
be
wilfull,
in
a
sense?
justice
scalia
i
don't
see
how
you
get
there.
the
conduct
must
be
willed
or
the
violation
of
the
law
must
be
willed,
and
then
you
are
just
adding
from
nowhere
an
additional
requirement,
in
face
of
a
known
risk.
i
don't
see
how
you
get
that
out
of
the
word
"wilfull".
that
is
all
i
am
saying.
