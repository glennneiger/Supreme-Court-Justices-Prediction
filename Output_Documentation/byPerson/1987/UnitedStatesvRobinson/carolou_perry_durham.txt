ms.
carolou
perry
durham
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
question
presented
is
a
fascinating
question.
question
number
1.
but
that
it
is
hypothetical
and
it
does
not
apply
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
question
presented
assumes
that
the
defense
counsel
argues
that
the
government
prevented
defense...
the
defendant
from
explaining
his
side
of
the
case.
in
fact,
no
where
in
defense
counsel's
argument
is
there
any
claim
that
the
government
prevented
the
defendant
from
explaining
his
side
of
the
case.
you
have
heard
read
aloud
to
you
an
excerpt--
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
--no,
sir,
i
was
not.
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
yes,
sir.
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
no,
sir.
we
are
not.
in
fact,
mr.
durham,
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you,
is
not
a
partner.
a
junior
member
of
the
first
at
best.
to
respond
to
your
comment,
at
the
side
bar,
defense
counsel
heard
the
prosecutor
say,
i
object
to
defense
arguing
about
the
defendant
not
getting
a
chance
to
explain,
and
the
court
sustained
that
objection
and
in
sustaining
that
objection,
the
court
went
on
and
gave
a
speech,
as
it
were,
covering
the
constitutional
issue,
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
not
to
testify
and
not
to
have
that
taken
as
an
inference
of
guilt,
and
the
trial
court
further
dealt
with
the
legal
question
of
whether
or
not
under
the
invited
response
doctrine
it
would
be
permissible
to
comment
on
the
defendant's
silence.
the
trial
court
ruled
on
an
objection.
a
little
later
on
in
that
same
bench
conference,
at
another
objection
that
the
prosecutor
presented
to
the
trial
judge,
the
trial
judge
turned
to
mr.
durham
and
said,
"what
do
you
have
to
say
for
that?
"
,
and
mr.
durham
said,
"i
appreciate
the
opportunity
of
being
heard
before
i
am
condemned.
"
i
contend
that
in
that
record,
without
any
testimony
from
defense
counsel
at
this
point,
in
that
reference,
he's
referring
back
to
the
comment
that
the
judge
had
just
said
he
would
allow
the
prosecutor
to
make.
when
an
objection
is
made
in
a
trial
court
and
that
objection
is
sustained,
as
a
practical
matter,
as
an
advocate
in
the
trial
procedure,
it
would
be
tremendously
impossible,
really,
to
object
again
to
each
ruling
of
the
court
that's
adverse
to
my
side.
if
that
were
the
case,
then
what
we
have
done
is
re-established
the
rule
that
exceptions
be
taken
to
rulings
which
are
adverse
and
which
you
would
have
the
court
have
an
opportunity
to
correct
contemporaneous
with
the
alleged
error,
so
that,
later,
you
could
appeal
it.
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
if
the
court
please,
it's
the
solicitor
general's
office
who
has
framed
the
question
presented,
that
the
government
prevented
the
defendant
from
explaining
his
side
of
the
story.
it
is
the
solicitor
general's
office
on
appeal
in
this
court
that
gives
rise
to
my
objection
to
that
really
hypothetical
situation
that
doesn't
apply
to
this
court.
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
i'm
sorry?
i
don't
understand.
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
if--
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
--if
i
may
quote
the
prosecutor
at
the
side
bench
conference,
he
said,
"several
things
in
that
argument
i
took
quite
a
bit
of
offense
to.
"
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
i
beg
your
pardon.

at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
"several
things
in
that
argument
i
took
quite
a
bit
of
offense
to.
"
"he
comes
up
and
starts
going
to
the
jury
and
he,
as
in
his
ethics,
said
they
tried
to
bring
proof
of
other
claims
that
they
submitted
were
false
and
he
stands
as
an
attorney
and
he
knows
darn
well
that
the
government
fully
intended
to
bring
other
claims
that
were
false.
"
"mr.
durham,
i
think,
has
stepped
beyond
the
bounds
of
good
argument
when
he's
talked
about
the
defendant's
were
not
given
by
the
government
the
right
to
explain.
"
"i
think
he
has
opened
the
door
and
has,
in
fact,
allowed
me
to
comment.
"
if
i
may
further
quote
the
paragraph
which
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
solicitor
general
as
being
the
paragraph
in
which
defense
counsel
is
said
to
have
told
the
jury
that
the
government
prevented
the
defendant
from
explaining,
if
i
may
refer
you
to
page
19
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
comes
immediately
after
discussing
the
large
difference
between
the
value
in
the
inventory
list
of
a
$106,000
to
offer
as
proof
on
a
$30,000
insurance
claim;
that
is,
to
get
$30,000
worth
of
money
from
the
insurance
company,
the
defendant
offered
an
inventory
list
of
burned
furnishings
that
amounted
to
$106,000
and
on
that
basis
of
that
large
difference
between
the
amount
of
money
claimed
and
the
value
of
the
furniture
listed
on
an
inventory
list
that
was
headed
by
the
defendant
at
the
time
it
was
submitted
to
the
insurance
company,--
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
--yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
because
immediately
before
this
paragraph
in
the
defense
counsel's
argument
on
page
19
of
the
joint
appendix,
what
led
up
to
this
statement--
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
--well,
i
submit
to
you,
your
honor,
that
the
trial
judge
was
mistaken
in
his
interpretation.
i
submit
that
he
took
the
worst
possible
interpretation
to
the
defense
counsel's
entire
argument,
and
that
if
the
prosecutor
is
allowed
some
leeway
in
the
mixture
of
syntax
and
the
disjointed
statements
that
occur
in
the
extemporaneous
nature
of
the
closing
arguments,
that
certainly
it
should
be
allowed
to
the
defense
counsel.
in
the
defense
counsel's
argument,
he
said
to
the
jury,
"in
trying
to
address
the
evidence
given
by
thirty-eight
witnesses
who
offered,
for
the
most
part,
very
circumstantial
incidents,
almost
all
of
which
could
in
the
record
be
explained
by
an
innocent
interpretation
of
the
circumstances--
"
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
--your
honor,
i
would
say
that
if
i
assumed
arguendo
that,
in
fact,
the
question
presented
did
occur
and
there
was
some
case
in
which
the
defense
counsel
argued
to
an
american
jury
that
the
government
prevented
the
defendant
from
taking
the
witness
stand
and
explaining
his
side
of
the
story,
i
submit
to
you
that
a
group
of
american
jurors
already
know
that.
in
fact,
this
court
has
long
recognized
in
a
long
tradition
of
cases
that
were
reiterated
and
cited
in
the
griffin
case
that
juries
have
a
natural
inclination
to
be
suspicious
of
a
defendant
who
does
not
take
the
witness
stand
and
deny
the
allegations
and
the
charges.
it's
one
thing
for
the
jurors
to
have
a
natural
suspicion
of
someone
who
doesn't
deny
charges,
but
it's
quite
another
for
the
united
states
attorney
to
reinforce
those
suspicions
by
commenting
on
the
defendant's
silence.
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
certainly,
your
honor,
if
the
defense...
under
the
young
decision,
if
the
defense
counsel
were
standing
there
saying
that
to
the
jury,
the
government
has
prevented
this
defendant
from
explaining
his
side
of
the
story,
at
that
point,
ideally,
under
the
young
decision,
the
court
should
interrupt
and
take
jurative
measures
in
the
form
of
instructions
to
the
jury
and
admonishments
to
the--
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
--i
do
not
believe--
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
--i
believe
there
is
more
than
the
two
alternatives
you
suggest.
if
the
defense
counsel
is
saying
or
if
the
trial
judge
is
interpreting
the
defense
counsel
as
saying
that
the
government
is
preventing
his
client
from
taking
the
stand,
then,
at
that
point,
the
trial
judge
can
interrupt
the
defense
counsel
and
say,
i
believe
you
are
misleading
the
jury.
it
is
the
government,
in
fact,
who
is
keeping
the
defendant
from
explaining
his
side
of
the
story
now.
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
if
the
trial
judge
should
interrupt
defense
counsel's
argument
and
call
him
to
the
bench
and
tell
them
that
he's
misstating
the
law
or
if
he
simply
said
it
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
you
are
misstating
the
law,
counsel,
and
then
counsel,
if
he
doesn't
understand,
if
the
judge
has
interpreted
what
he's
saying
as
meaning
that
the
defendant
wasn't
allowed
to
take
the
stand,
counsel
can
say,
may
i
approach
the
bench,
and
then
find
out
that
the
judge
is
interpreting
what
he's
saying
in
that
way.
ms.
carolou
perry
durham
sir,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
either
the
judge
or
the
united
states
attorney
should
say
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
that
the
defendant
could
have
taken
the
witness
stand
and
testified
and
explained
himself.
i
am
not
saying
that.
there
are
other
ways
that
a
court
can
deal
with
such
a
statement
if
it
should
occur.
even
to
the
extent
of
declaring
a
mistrial
according
to
the
young
decision.
crucially,
though,
an
essential
question
here
in
this
and
in
any
question
about
a
comment
on
the
defendant's
failure
to
take
the
witness
stand
is
the
context
in
which
it
was
heard
by
the
jury,
and
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
or
not
it
injected
into
the
jury
deliberations
something
outside
of
the
lawfully,
validly-offered
evidence.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
this
jury,
in
fact,
was
prejudiced
in
arriving
at
its
decision
that
mr.
robinson
was
guilty
as
charged.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
then
i
will
rest.
