justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question,
mr.
robbins?
if
the
defense
counsel's
summation
had
merely
said,
and
it's
somewhat
ambiguous,
that
at
the
time
the
defendant
was
interviewed
by
claims
agents
and
fbi
agents
and
so
forth,
conditions
were
very...
were
such
that
he
didn't
really
have
an
opportunity
to
explain,
they
didn't
give
him
an
opportunity
to
explain,
clearly
he
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
explain
at
that
time
before
he
was
indicted,
before
the
case
started,
if
that's
all
he
said,
would
the
rebuttal
argument
have
been
proper?
justice
stevens
well,
supposing
the
prosecutor
said,
my
opponent
made
the
argument
that
my
client
or
that
the
defendant
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
explain
during
the
claims
adjustment
process,
and
maybe
that's
right,
but
he
has
had
an
opportunity
at
the
trial
here
to
come
up
with
the
explanation,
he
hasn't
done
so,
would
that
be
proper
rebuttal?
he
hasn't
done
so
when
he
could
have
gotten
on
the
stand.
justice
stevens
and
it
emphasizes
before
the
jury
that
the
man
didn't
get
on
the
witness
stand.
justice
stevens
well,
to
put
it
another
way,
would
you
not
agree
that
the
rule
of
griffin
can
be
violated
by
some
indirect...
by
emphasizing
the
failure
to
testify
in
the
sort
of
pre-textual
way
that
you
don't
affirmatively
argue
as
they
did
in
griffin,
that
you
can
draw
this
inference,
but
they
just
kind
of
emphasize...
would
you
not
agree
that
some
kinds
of
emphasis
on
the
failure
to
get
on
the
stand
violate
the
basic
rule
of
griffin?

justice
stevens
if
the
prosecutor
here
had
not
asked
for
the
judge's
permission
in
advance,
it
seems
to
me
this
would
be
rather
close
on
the
factual
question
that
i
give
you,
because
i
can
read
some
of
the
comment.
i'm
not
really
sure
there's
ever
an
unambiguous
statement
in
defense
counsel's
argument
that
he's
referring
to
the
fact...
suggesting
that
he
didn't
have
a
chance
to
get
on
the
witness
stand.
he
seems
to
be
talking
about
the
adjustment
process.
justice
stevens
i'd
like
to
place
some
emphasis
on
it.
not
only
is
it
a
good
procedure,
but
it
also
gives
the
trial
judge
a
chance
to
clear
up
something
by
instruction
that
would
avoid
a
significant
risk
of
error.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there's
error
here,
but
certainly,
i
think,
he
was
to
be
commended
for
raising
this
with
the
trial
judge.
justice
stevens
but
you
would
agree,
wouldn't
you,
mr.
robbins,
that
the
test
for
harmless
error
is
different,
depending
on
whether
it's
a
constitutional
error
or
non-constitutional
error?
justice
stevens
doesn't
that
sound
like
one
of
them's
maybe
a
little
more
important
than
the
other?
justice
stevens
which
rule
would
you
change?
kotteakus
or
chapman?
do
you
think
they
should
be
the
same?
