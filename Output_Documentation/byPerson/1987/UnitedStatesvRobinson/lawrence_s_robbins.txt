mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
of
the
6th
circuit
in
this
case
reversing
the
two
mail
fraud
convictions
of
thomas
robinson
flounders,
we
submit,
on
two
central
misconceptions.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
misread
this
court's
decision
in
griffin
against
california
when
it
held
that
the
prosecutor's
rebuttal
summation
was
an
impermissible
comment
on
mr.
robinson's
failure
to
testify.
the
rule
in
griffin,
we
suggests,
forbids
only
those
comments
that
serve
no
proper
purpose
but,
rather,
invite
the
jury
to
treat
the
defendant's
silence
as
evidence
of
his
guilt.
the
rebuttal
remarks
under
that
standard
were
not
impermissible.
secondly,
the
court
of
appeals
erroneously
supposed
that
it
was
freer
to
find
plain
error
in
this
case
because
the
prosecutor's
remarks
never
objected
to
at
trial
implicated
robinson's
constitutional
rights.
we
believe
that
there
is
no
basis
to
distinguish
between
constitutional
and
non-constitutional
errors
in
applying
the
plain
error
doctrine.
let
me
begin,
if
i
might,
with
the
griffin
issue.
the
court
of
appeals
discerned
the
violation
of
griffin
in
the
prosecutor's
rebuttal
summation.
defense
counsel,
for
his
part,
had
summed
up
prior
to
the
rebuttal
and
proclaimed
at
the
outset
that
his
theme
in
the
summation
would
be
the
government's
failure
to
play
fair
with
the
jury.
after
claiming
that
the
government
had
unfairly
filtered
the
evidence
in
its
presentation
and
that
it
had
consistently
denied
robinson
a
chance
to
explain
his
actions,
defense
counsel
then
posed
this
rhetorical
question
to
the
jury:
"now,
would
you
like
to
get
indicted
for
that
without
the
government
being
fair
and
being
able
to
explain
before
you,
members
of
your
own
community,
rather
than
before
the
agents?
"
after
the
defense
lawyer
completed
his
remarks,
the
prosecutor
asked
for
a
side
bar
and
both
attorneys
approached
the
trial
court.
at
that
point,
the
government
lawyer
objected
to
the
remarks
and
asked
for
leave
to
respond.
the
court
granted
that
motion,
agreeing
with
the
prosecutor
that
defense
counsel
had
wrongfully
asserted
that
the
government
was
responsible
for
mr.
robinson's
failure
to
testify.
defense
counsel,
for
his
part,
registered
no
objection
at
this
time
nor
did
he
quarrel
with
the
trial
court
and
the
government's
construction
of
his
summation
remarks
and,
therefore,
acting
pursuant
to
the
trial
court's
ruling,
the
prosecutor
stated
in
rebuttal
that
defense
counsel
"has
made
comments
to
the
extent
the
government
has
not
allowed
the
defendants
an
opportunity
to
explain.
"
"it
is
totally
unacceptable.
"
and
he
stated
further,
"he",
that
is
the
defendant,
"could
have
taken
the
stand
and
explained
it
to
you.
"
"anything
he
wanted
to.
"
"the
united
states
of
america
has
given
him
throughout
the
opportunity
to
explain.
"
and,
again,
the
defense
counsel
made
no
objection.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
6th
circuit
found
in
these
remarks
a
clear
violation
of
the
defendant's
constitutional
right
not
to
testify
under
griffin.
we
disagree.
griffin
does
not
prohibit
each
and
every
reference
to
a
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
rather,
griffin
forbids
those
comments
but
only
those
comments
that
serve
no
proper
purpose
and
simply
invite
the
jury
to
treat
the
defendant's
silence
as
evidence
of
guilt.
the
griffin
case
itself,
we
suggest,
confirms
this
limiting
principle.
in
griffin,
after
all,
the
prosecutor
and
the
trial
court
told
the
jury
that
from
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
testify,
it
could
infer
that
each
and
every
fact
that
he
could
have
but
failed
to
explain
was
more
likely
than
not
to
be
true
and
that
they
could
use
those
findings
as
evidence
against
the
defendant.
this
court,
reviewing
that
record,
found
that
the
comments
of
the
prosecutor
and
the
trial
court
in
griffin
"tendered
to
the
jury
for
its
consideration
the
failure
of
the
accused
to
testify.
"
thus,
the
court
explained,
the
comments
of
the
prosecutor
and
trial
court
in
griffin
"solemnized
the
silence
of
the
accused
into
evidence
against
him.
"
the
griffin
court
reasoned
that
it
is
simply
improper
to
infer
from
the
failure
to
testify
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
the
crime
charged
and
it
discerned
a
number
of
reasons
wholly
apart
from
the
defendant's
guilt
that
could
account
for
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
the
court
in
griffin
reasoned
that
when
a
prosecutor
or
trial
judge
invites
the
jury
to
find
a
defendant
guilty
based
on
his
failure
to
testify,
it
has,
in
effect,
imposed
a
penalty
on
the
defendant's
exercise
of
a
fifth
amendment
privilege.
but
surely
not
every
comment
pertaining
or
alluding
to
the
failure
to
testify
"solemnizes
the
silence
of
the
accused
into
evidence
against
him.
"
and
this
case,
for
example,
does
not
fit
that
profile
at
all.
here,
the
prosecutor
did
not
urge
the
jury
to
treat
the
defendant's
silence
as
evidence
against
him.
when
he
advised
the
jury
that
the
government
cannot
be
blamed
for
mr.
robinson's
decision
not
to
testify,
the
prosecutor
simply
dispelled
a
mistaken
impression,
indeed,
a
misleading
impression,
left
in
their
minds
by
the
defense
lawyer
in
his
summation.
the
rebuttal
remarks
thus
had
an
entirely
lawful
purpose
unrelated
to
the
evidentiary
use
and
evidentiary
significance
of
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
the
rule
that
we
suggest
should
govern
griffin
claims
in
this
case
and
in
general
is
this:
when
a
prosecutor
has
a
lawful
purpose
in
making
his
comments,
a
purpose
that
is
unrelated
to
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify,
he
does
not
violate
the
rule
in
griffin.
that's
true
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
rule
in
griffin--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
don't
see
how,
justice
marshall.
it
seems
pretty
clear
to
us
that,
first
of
all,
the
prosecutor's
remarks
in
this
case
did,
indeed,
have
a
lawful
purpose,
and
that
was
to
dispel--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
no.
i
think
it
had
a
lawful...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--his
overall
purpose--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
don't
dispute
that
the
government
is
charged
in
a
prosecution
it
has
brought
to
try
and
persuade
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
a
defendant's
guilt
or
else
they
wouldn't
be
there.
but
i
do
very
much
believe
that
there
were
proper
purposes
short
of
that
that
can
account
and
do
account
for
what
the
prosecutor
did
in
his
rebuttal
in
this
case.
specifically,
the
defense
lawyer
had
left
the
clear
and
misleading
impression
that
the
government
was
somehow
responsible
for
mr.
robinson's
failure
to
testify.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
could
have
been
corrected
by
instruction,
but
we
don't
think
that
it
must
be
corrected
by
instruction.
we
don't
think
that
in
a
case
where
the
government
has
a
proper
response
that
can
correct
a
misleading
impression,
it
must
forego
its
opportunity
to
correct
the
impression
itself,
and
certainly
none
of
this
court's
cases,
including
its
decision
in
young,
suggest
that
the
government
must
forego
the
opportunity
to
give
perfectly
permissible
response.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
neither
do,
but
i
don't--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
respectfully
must
disagree,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
i
have
said
and
what
i
say
again
is
that
the
kind
of
comment
that
took
place
in
this
case
was
not
a
comment
on
the
failure
to
testify
in
the
griffin
sense.
it
was,
of
course,
a
comment
pertaining,
relating
and
alluding
to
the
failure
to
testify,
but
not
remotely
in
the
sense
that
the
griffin
court
was
concerned
about.
the
griffin
court,
we
submit,
was
faced
with
a
situation--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
i
don't
think
it
was
a
remark
in
passing.
i
think
it
was
a
remark
very
deliberately
made,
but
for
a
lawful
and
permissible
purpose,
that
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
concerns
that
moved
the
griffin
court.
it
seems
to
us,
for
example,
that
this
remark
was
no
more
a
comment
on
silence
than
was
the
instruction
given
over
the
defendant's
objection
in
lakeside
against
oregon.
there,
too,
there
was
a
comment
in
that
case
by
the
trial
court
pertaining
to
the
failure
to
testify.
specifically,
telling
the
jury
that
it
may
draw
no
adverse
inference
from
the
failure
to
testify.
in
that
case,
the
defendant
made
much
the
same
kind
of
argument
that
appealed
to
the
6th
circuit
in
this
case.
he
said,
well,
that's
a
comment
on
my
silence
because
it
is,
of
course,
related
to
my
failure
to
testify.
but
this
court
flatly
rejected
that
argument.
it
said
that
not
every
comment
is
a
griffin
impermissible
comment,
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
reminds
the
jury
that
the
defendant
didn't
take
the
stand,
a
fact
which
we
suggest
they
rarely
need
to
be
reminded
about,
nevertheless
doesn't
put
it
within
the
griffin
proscriptions,
and
we
think
this
is
no
more
prohibitive
in
griffin
than
the
comments
in
lakeside.
for
the
same
reason
that
the
lakeside
comment
was
not
impermissible,
because
it
did
not
invite
the
jury
to
draw
an
inference
of
guilt
from
the
failure
to
take
the
stand.
that
is
not
what
the
prosecutor
said
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
what
he
said
is
that,
in
effect,
do
not
be
misled
into
thinking
that
we
are
responsible
for
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify,
and
that's,
indeed,
just
exactly
what
the
defense
lawyer
had
said
in
his
prior
remarks.
it
seems
to
us
that
when,
as
here,
there
is
a
proper
purpose
for
the
remarks,
unrelated
to
asking
the
jury
to
draw
an
adverse
inference
of
guilt,
it
promotes
and
not
undermines
the
truth-finding
function
of
the
trial
to
permit
that
statement
to
be
made.
that,
we
take
it,
is
the
clear
lesson
of
this
court's
decision
in
rafael
against
the
united
states,
in
which
this
court
held
that
a
defendant's
failure
to
testify
at
an
earlier
trial
may
be
used
to
impeach
his
credibility
when
he
testifies
upon
retrial.
it
is
likewise
the
lesson,
we
think,
of
a
broader
line
of
cases,
like
harris
against
new
york
and
walder
against
the
united
states,
that
make
clear
that
prosecutors
must
have
considerable
latitude
during
impeachment
and
rebuttal
precisely
because
the
demands
of
the
truth-finding
function
require
it.
now,
there's
a
second
reason
why
we
suggest
that
the
rule
of
griffin
as
we
have
urged
it
makes
a
good
deal
of
sense,
and
that's
this:
where
prosecutor's
remarks
serve
a
lawful
and
proper
purpose
unrelated
to
asking
the
jury
to
infer
guilt
from
silence,
there's
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
jury
will
understand
it
in
the
impermissible
way.
as
this
court
explained
in
donnelly
against
dechristoforo,
remarks
by
a
prosecutor
should
not
be
interpreted
in
their
worst
possible
way,
and
when
a
prosecutor's
remarks
serve,
as
we
suggest
they
do
in
this
case,
an
important
truth-finding
function,
courts
should
not
presume
that
the
jury
will
take
those
remarks
as
forbidden
comment.
indeed,
that
is
a
particularly
appropriate
rule
to
apply
in
this
case
because
the
jury
was
instructed
by
the
trial
court
in
instructions
that
were
similarly
not
objected
to,
to
draw
no
inference
or
guilt
from
the
failure
to
take
the
stand.
in
short,
we
believe
the
rule
in
griffin
ought
not
to
be
construed
to
stifle
argument
that
serves
a
legitimate
truth-finding
purpose.
in
this
case,
the
trial
court
concluded
that
the
prosecutor's
remarks
would
ensure
that
the
jury
was
not
misled
by
defense
counsel's
summation.
that
judgment
was
plainly
correct
and
should
not
have
been
reversed,
least
of
all
on
the
authority
of
griffin.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
the
rebuttal
argument
may
have
been
improper,
but
not
because
it
violates
griffin.
the
rebuttal
argument
would
still
not
have
been
one
calculated
or
on
its
face
likely
to
have
the
effect
of
asking
the
jury
to
infer
guilt
from
silence,
but
it
would
have
been
improper
for
a
different
reason,
and
that
is
because
it
was
not
proper
rebuttal.
it
was
not
responsive
to
anything
that
the
defense
lawyer
had
said.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
my
inclination
is
to
think
not.
again,
for
the
reason
that
it
is
not
calculated
to
respond
to
precisely
the
argument
made.
it
is,
i
think,
a
bit
of
analytical
overkill
and
because
it's
not
narrowly--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--that's
correct.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
are--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
i
am
not
willing
to
defend
pre-textual
arguments,
and
i
think
they
can
happen.
in
one
of
this
court's
cases,
there's
a
rather
lengthy
quotation
from
an
instruction
that
the
jury
may
draw
no
inference
from
the
failure
to
testify,
and
it
was
repeated
about
thirty-five
times,
until
the
jury
finally
got
the
message
that
perhaps
they
should
have
drawn
an
inference.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
but
let
me
suggest,
justice
stevens,
that
there
is
a
danger
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
as
well
with
these
indirect
references
to
silence.
we
think,
frankly,
that
the
lower
courts
have
gone
a
little
bit
overboard
in
what
constitutes
indirect
comment.
at
a
point
of
indirection,
there's
no
good
reason
to
think
that
the
jury
is
going
to
take
those
comments
in
an
impermissible
way.
i
have
in
mind
the
legions
of
cases
dealing...
in
which
the
prosecutor
says,
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted,
is
unrefuted,
and
in
which
the
courts
of
appeals
nevertheless
feel
constrained
to
struggle
with
that
as
a
griffin
problem.
it
isn't,
and
it
isn't
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
and
the
rule
that
we
have
urged
today,
we
think,
will
settle
a
great
many
of
those
and
reduce
disputes
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
meaning
of
griffin.
it
will
not
solve
cases
of
pretext
and
we're
not
prepared
to
defend
cases
of
pretext.
where
it's
clear
that
the
prosecutor
is
trying
to
get
through
the
back
door
what
the
law
prohibits
through
the
front
door,
we
don't
defend
it,
and
it
ought
to
be
impermissible.
but
those
are
rather
a
small
class
of
cases
compared
to
cases
that
griffin
simply
doesn't
control.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
am,
justice
stevens,
not
prepared
to
assert
that
the
defense
counsel's
remarks
are
a
model
of
clarity.
i
think
there
is
a
good
deal
of
ambiguity
to
them,
which
is
exactly
why
the
law
insists
that
the
participants
in
the
trial
make
their
views
known
to
the
trial
court.
in
this
case,
there's
every
good
reason
to
indulge
the
presumption
that
the
trial
judge
understood
these
remarks
as
inviting
the
response
that
were
made,
the
response
that
was
made.
the
language
that
was
used
is
one
that
we
still
don't
have
an
accounting
for,
except
in
the
way
that
the
trial
court
understood
it.
after
all,
the
defense
lawyer
said,
used
the
words,
"being
able
to
explain,
have
him
explain
before
you,
members
of
your
own
community.
"
at
a
minimum,
those
can
be
understood
the
way
the
trial
judge
understood
them.
beyond
that,
of
course,
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
understood
them
that
way
is
a
pretty
good,
indeed,
in
our
view,
the
best
barometer
that
that's
the
way
they
want
to
be
understood.
we
refer
in
this
connection
to
the
court's
remarks
in
a
different
context
in
patent
against
young,
in
which
the
court
said
that
demeanor,
inflection,
the
flow
of
the
questions
and
answers
can
make
confused
and
conflicting
utterances
incomprehensible
and,
therefore,
went
on
to
hold
that
the
trial
court's
understanding,
the
trial
judge's
interpretation
is
the
best
barometer
for
making
sense
of
what
happens
during
a
trial
proceeding.
and,
of
course,
here
was
a
case
where
the
defense
lawyer
stood
at
side
bar
with
the
other
participants,
heard
what
the
trial
judge
and
the
government
lawyer
thought
his
remarks
meant,
and
said
nothing,
and
it's
not
just
that
he
said
nothing,
but
he
objected
to
some
other
claim
that
the
government
wished
to
make
in
rebuttal.
he
objected
to
that,
but
conspicuously
said
nothing
about
the
claim
that
brings
us
to
court
today.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
goes
beyond
inadvertence
and
calls
to
mind
justice
frankfurter's
remarks
in
johnson
against
the
united
states
that
sometimes
the
failure
to
object
should
be
understood
as
acquiescence
that
nothing
is
objectionable
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
there
is
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
we
don't
think
our
position
would
be
any
different
had
he
not
done
so
in
this
case.
we
do
think,
however,
that
the
fact
that
he
did
so
bears
on
the
analysis
to
this
extent:
it
gave
the
defense
lawyer
a
chance
to
give
his
side
of
the
story,
to
give
his
interpretation.
if
he
believed
then
as
respondent's
counsel
states
now
that
his
remarks
should
have
a
different
meaning,
there
was
his
opportunity
to
say
so.
no,
i
think
in
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
the
government
could
have
proceeded
to
rebuttal
and
said
exactly
what
he
said
without
any
clearance
from
the
trial
court.
it
is,
however,
good
procedure
to
do
so.
it
does
give
the
people
a
chance
to
air
the
views
and
the
trial
court
has
an
opportunity
to
rule.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
we
agree.
the
court
of
appeals
compounded
its
misreading
of
griffin,
we
think,
by
its
flawed
application
of
the
plain
error
doctrine.
now,
once
before
in
this
litigation,
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
the
6th
circuit
and
remanded
the
case
in
light
of
the
united
states
against
young.
in
young,
the
court
had
reiterated
the
bed
rock
principle
that
contemporaneous
objections
are
the
rule
and
plain
error
a
narrow
exception.
the
plain
error
exception,
the
court
explained,
is
available
only
to
correct
particularly
egregious
errors
and,
more
specifically,
those
errors
that
seriously
affect
the
fairness,
integrity
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
on
remand,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
adhered
to
its
earlier
judgment
and
it
did
so,
at
least
in
part,
because
it
believed
it
was
freer
to
find
plain
error
where,
as
in
this
case,
the
error
implicated
constitutional
rights.
four
reasons
counsel
against
adopting
such
a
distinction.
first,
the
text
of
rule
52(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
the
accompanying
advisory
committee
notes
offer
no
basis
for
making
that
distinction.
neither
the
rule
nor
the
notes
treat
constitutional
claims
in
any
special
way.
second,
directing
a
distinction
of
this
sort
violates
what
we
think
is
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule
which
is
the
governing
rule
to
which
the
plain
error
doctrine
is,
as
the
court
noted
in
young,
a
narrow
exception.
objections,
after
all,
alert
the
trial
judge
to
the
fact
that
a
party
actually
disapproves
of
something
that
happened
at
trial.
it
permits
the
trial
court
to
rectify
that
error
before
it
irrevocably
taints
the
verdict,
and
it
frames
the
issue
on
appeal.
none
of
those
purposes,
we
suggest,
is
well
served
by
distinguishing
between
constitutional
and
non-constitutional
claims.
to
the
contrary,
this
issue,
this
case,
rather,
illustrates
why
any
such
distinction
would
be
terribly
counterproductive.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
exactly.
it
is
only
because
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
this
was
a
griffin
violation
that
it
felt
constrained
in
the
first
place
to
treat
it
as
a
harmless
error
and
then,
on
remand,
in
light
of
young,
it
went
on
to
consider
what
it
took
to
be
the
plain
error
rule.
as
i
say,
in
this
case
is
a
terrific
illustration
of
why
you
need
objections.
had
an
objection
been
made
after
all
in
this
case,
the
trial
court
would
have
been
alerted
to
defense
counsel's
view,
at
least
his
presently-held
view,
that
the
summation
remarks
had
a
different
meaning.
an
objection
here,
had
it
been
made,
would
have
allowed
the
trial
court
to
refuse
to
permit
the
rebuttal
just
as
he
refused
a
second
request
made
by
the
prosecutor
to
make
a
different
argument
in
the
rebuttal.
third,
this
court's
cases
construing
the
plain
error
doctrine
do
not
stand
for
any
distinction
between
constitutional
and
non-constitutional
claims.
now,
respondent
has
suggested
otherwise
in
his
brief,
but
that's
only
because
he
is
taking
every
claim,
every
case
that
the
court
has
decided
under
the
plain
error
doctrine,
and
recharacterized
them
as
constitutional
cases.
in
some
instances,
by
calling
them
fair
trial
cases
or
due
process
cases.
in
any
event,
we
think
that
that
misreads
the
cases
which
did
not,
in
fact,
turn
on
any
constitutional
claim,
but
in
a
larger
sense,
respondent's
position
illustrates
precisely
why
no
such
distinction
should
be
made.
because
the
fact
that
these
kinds
of
claims
can
be
so
easily
restyled
in
constitutional
terms
suggests
that
trial
courts
need
to
hear
objections
no
matter
what
we
label
the
claim,
constitutional
or
otherwise.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no
question
about
it.
we
believe--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
we
don't
think,
justice
stevens,
that
the
court
is
required
to
treat
plain
error
distinctions
in
the
same
way,
primarily
because
the
plain
error
doctrine
serves
a
different
function
in
the
trial
system
than
the
harmless
error
doctrine
does.
second
of
all,
we
are
not
entirely
persuaded
that
chapman
and
kotteakus
should
have
different
rules
and,
therefore,
we
are
not
certain
that
the
analysis
that
has
developed
in
the
harmless
error
should
be
made
in
the
context
of
plain
error.
this
much
we
are
sure
of,
however,
that
this
court's
cases--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
am
inclined
to
change
chapman
and
make
it
much
more
like
kotteakus,
but
i
am
sure
of
this
much,
there's
no
good
reason
to
apply
the
same
distinction
in
this
case.
after
all,
what
would
the
distinction
look
like?
if
the
plain
error
rule
requires
that
constitution...
if
non-constitutional
errors
must
be
egregious
to
apply
the
plain
error
rule,
may
constitutional
errors
be
almost
egregious
or
really
awful
but
not
quite
egregious?
the
problem
is
the
rule
is
incapable
of
rational
application.
it
leads
to
inconsistencies,
additional
layers
of
review,
and
is
subject
to
terribly
inexplicable
results.
take
this
case,
for
example.
believing
itself
free
to
relax
the
plain
error
rule,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
prosecutor's
rebuttal
remarks
in
this
case
violated
its
conception
of
the
plain
error
doctrine.
the
court
so
held
despite
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
explicitly
was
responding
to
defense
counsel's
remarks,
despite
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
gave
the
jury
an
instruction
on
drawing
no
inference
from
the
failure
to
testify,
despite
the
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt,
we
suggest,
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
jury's
split
verdict
indicate
their
ability
to
parcel
the
evidence
fairly.
the
court,
this
court,
should
not
approve
a
novel
standard
for
plain
error
that
is
capable
of
producing
a
judgment
like
this
one.
we
believe,
in
short,
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
is
flawed
at
every
turn.
it
over-reads
griffin
and
under-reads
young,
and
in
the
context
of
a
trial
with
enough
evidence
to
convict
mr.
robinson
ten
times
over,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
upon
a
purported
defect
so
abstract
that
it
escaped
even
defense
counsel's
notice
at
the
time.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
have
no
rebuttal,
your
honor.
