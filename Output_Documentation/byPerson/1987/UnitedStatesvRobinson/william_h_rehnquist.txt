we'll
hear
argument
in
number
86-937,
united
states
against
thomas
o.
robinson,
jr.--
mr.
robbins,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
now
some
rule
prevailing
in
the
federal
courts
that
the
united
states
attorney
has
to
clear
his
closing
argument
with
the
trial
judge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
durham.
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from,
ms.
durham?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
ms.
durham,
to
get
back
a
moment
from
what
the
trial
court
understood,
if
you
go
back
to
page
25
of
the
transcript,
right
after
that
section
that
you
just
read
about
where
the
prosecutor,
mr.
washko,
says,
"mr.
durham,
i
think,
has
stepped
beyond
the
bounds
of
good
argument,
that
defense
was
not
given
by
the
government
the
right
to
explain.
"
then
the
court
says,
"that
is
the
part
that
bothers
me.
"
mr.
washko
says,
"that
bothers
me.
"
"i
think
he
opened
the
door.
"
the
court,
"yes,
mr.
washko,
i
will
tell
you
what,
the
fifth
amendment
ties
the
government's
hands
in
terms
of
commenting
on
the
defense
failure
to
testify,
but
tying
his
hands
is
not
putting
you
into
a
boxing
match
with
your
hands
tied
behind
your
back.
"
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
difficult
to
argue
from
that
transcript
that
the
trial
judge
didn't
understand
the
defense
summation
just
as
the
government
says
it
should
be
understood.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
are
just
asking
us
to
interpret
in
the
abstract
what
do
these
bunch
of
words
mean
that
defense
counsel
said.
now,
that
may
be
a
perfectly
proper
part
of
your
argument,
but
insofar
as
the
point
as
to
how
the
trial
judge,
who
is
sitting
right
there
and
heard
it,
goes,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
just
go
back
to
another
section
of
the
argument
because
the
trial
judge
indicates
he
understood
it
the
way
the
prosecutor
understood
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
durham.
mr.
robbins,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
second
case
no.
86-937,
united
states
against
robinsons.
respondent,
thomas
robinson
was
charged
with
mail
fraud
involving
arson-related
insurance
claims.
he
did
not
testify
a
trial.
in
his
closing
argument
to
the
jury,
his
lawyer
charged
that
the
government
had
not
allowed
him
to
explain
his
side
of
the
story.
following
this
closing
and
out
of
the
presence
of
a
jury,
the
prosecution
objected
to
the
remarks
of
the
defense
counsel,
and
contended
of
the
defendants
had
opened
the
door
to
comment
on
the
defendant's
failure
to
take
the
stand.
the
district
court
agreed
and
the
defense
offered
no
objection.
in
his
rebuttal
submission,
the
prosecution
stated
that
the
defendant's
assertion
that
the
government
had
not
allowed
him
to
explain
was
unacceptable.
the
prosecution
noted
that
the
defendant
could
have
taken
the
witness
stand
and
explained
his
actions
to
the
jury.
the
jury
convicted
the
defendant.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
the
convictions
concluding
that
the
prosecution's
comments
had
deprived
the
defendant
of
his
fifth
amendment
right
against
self-incrimination.
we
intern,
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
as
explained
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
conclude
that
in
a
light
of
a
remarks
of
the
defense
counsel,
the
prosecution's
comment
did
not
transgress
the
bound
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
defense
counsel
basically
opened
the
door
for
the
matter
and
serious
requires
that
the
government
would
be
allowed
to
respond.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
on
opinion
concurring
in
part
in
dissenting
in
part;
justice
marshall
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan
has
joined.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part.
