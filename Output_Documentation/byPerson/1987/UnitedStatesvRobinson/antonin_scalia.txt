justice
scalia
were
you
counsel
below?
justice
scalia
were
you
counsel
at
trial?
well,
if
what
you
just
said
is
true,
it
would
have
been
so
easy
for
defense
counsel
to
make
that
point
to
the
trial
judge.
i
mean,
that
would
be
a
good
argument
if
there
hadn't
been
the
side
bar
conference
before
this
rebuttal
was
made.
but,
surely,
the
time
to
make
that
argument
would
have
been...
if
defense
counsel
agreed
with
you,
he
would
have
said
to
the
judge,
what
are
you
talking
about.
we
didn't
urge
the
jury
that
he
hasn't
had
a
chance
to
testify
here.
why
didn't
counsel
say
that?
your
partner
was
defense
counsel?
justice
scalia
are
you
husband
and
wife?
justice
scalia
i
am
not
going
to
the
point
of
whether
there's
an
objection
or
not.
it's
really
much
more
basic
than
that.
one
would
have
expected
him
not
merely
to
object,
but
assuming
he
objected,
to
say
what
are
you
talking
about,
i
didn't
make
any
comment
about
his
being
prevented
from
testifying
here.
that's
the
reading
of
this
language
that
you're
urging
upon
us,
and
if
that
was
the
reading
that
defense
counsel
took
of
it,
it
seems
to
me
he
would
have
been
outraged
at
the
suggestion
that
the
government
should
be
able
to
reply
to
a
comment
that
he
never
made
and
there's
nothing
in
the
transcript
that
suggests
anything
like
that.
justice
scalia
ms.
durham,
assume
you
can't
persuade
us
on
that
and
that
we
sort
of
think
it
was
to
be
understood
the
way
the
trial
court
understood
it,
all
right,
that's
not
the
end
of
your
case.
you
would
still
say,
you
would
still
say
that
we
should
affirm
you,
right?
justice
scalia
well,
now,
i'm
giving
you
a
situation
in
which,
if
you
accept
the
trial
judge's
interpretation
of
it,
defense
counsel
has
said
the
government
has
prevented
my
client
from
testifying
and
explaining
to
you
what
really
happened
here,
now
what
could
have
been
done
to
remedy
that,
if
he
had
said
that?
you're
saying
nothing,
nothing
need
to
be
done
at
all?
what
the
government
says
is
all
we
want
to
do
is
come
up
and
say
that's
not
true.
justice
scalia
this
is
what
your
case
hangs
on.
you
would
rather
have
the
judge
tell
the
jury
this
man
could
have
taken
the
stand
himself
if
he
wanted
to.
it
wasn't
the
government
that
prevented
him.
it
was
his
own
decision.
you'd
rather
have
the
judge
tell
that
to
the
jury
than
have
the
united
states
attorney
tell
it
to
the
jury?
wouldn't
you
much
rather
have
the
united
states
attorney
tell
it?
they
might
be
inclined
to
disbelieve
it.
justice
scalia
if
the
judge
tells
them,--
justice
scalia
--why
is
it
okay
for
the
trial
judge
to
do
that,
but
not
okay
for
the
united
states
attorney
to
do
that?
certainly,
the
trial
judge
cannot
comment
upon
the
defendant's
failure
to
take
the
stand,
can
he?
the
trial
judge
can't
say,
by
the
way,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
you
may
have
noticed
that
the
defendant
didn't
take
the
stand.
the
u.s.
attorney
can't
do
that
nor
can
the
trial
judge,
but
somehow,
in
this
case,
you're
telling
us
it
would
have
been
all
right
for
the
trial
judge
to
do
it,
but
it's
not
all
right
for
the
united
states
attorney.
i
don't
understand
how
that
can
be.
justice
scalia
to
a
violation
here
is
that
the
united
states
attorney
said
what
the...
the
very
thing
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
said,
and
that's
a
constitutional
violation.
