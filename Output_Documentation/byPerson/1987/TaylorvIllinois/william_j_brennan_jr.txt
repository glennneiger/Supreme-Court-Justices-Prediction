justice
jr.
mr.
shabat,
may
i
ask,
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
defendant
was
closely
involved
in
this
noncompliance
with
the
discovery
rule,
or
was
it
just
the
lawyer
who
was
responsible?
justice
jr.
yes,
but
my
question
was
was
defendant
personally
involved
in
the
noncompliance?
justice
jr.
then
the
answer
to
my
question
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
defendant
was
personally
involved
in
this?
justice
jr.
mr.
shabat,
suppose
in
this
case
instead
of
saying
what
he
did
to
the
judge,
as
i
understand
what
you
told
us,
that
what
defense
counsel
said
was
i
have
just
learned,
suppose
he
had
gone
to
the
judge
and
said,
judge,
i
made
an
awful
boner
here,
it
is
not
my
client's
fault,
i
have
known
about
this
witness
and
i
forgot
to
put
it
down,
and
that
is
why
i
did
not
comply
with
the
discovery
rule,
and
i
do
not
think
that
my
client
should
be
penalized
by
denying
him
his
right
under
the
sixth
amendment
in
those
circumstances,
what
would
you
do
with
a
case
like
that?
justice
jr.
just
when
it
occurred
here.
