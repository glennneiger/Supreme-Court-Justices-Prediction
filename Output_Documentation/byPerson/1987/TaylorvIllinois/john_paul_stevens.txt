justice
stevens
would
the
case
be
different
constitutionally
if
instead
of
the
attorney
that
it
was
the
defendant
himself
who
had
just
not
brought
forth
this
witness
until
the
last
minute
because
he
is
afraid
that
he
might
have
been
intimidated,
or
maybe
he
intimidated
the
witness
and
did
not
want
to
identify
him
until
right
before
trial?
justice
stevens
you
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
preclusion
sanction
is
never
appropriate?
justice
stevens
but
you
just
seemed
to
be
abandoning
it.
justice
stevens
but
your
more
extreme
position
that
it
is
never
an
appropriate
sanction
would
require
us
to
even
allow
the
defendant
to
play
games
with
the
court?
justice
stevens
and
you
are
saying
that
this
kind
of
waiver
could
be
made
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
by
his
counsel?
justice
stevens
but
you
did
not
really
make
a
constitutional
argument
to
the
trial
judge
at
the
time
of
his
ruling,
you
did
not
say
that
there
was
a
constitutional
requirement
of
the
balancing
test?
justice
stevens
but
what
i
am
really
suggesting
is,
i
am
not
suggesting,
that
technically
there
is
not
jurisdiction.
but
you
are
in
effect
saying
that
the
trial
judge
committed
constitutional
error
because
he
did
do
a
balancing
test
that
he
was
never
asked
to
perform.
the
trial
lawyer
said,
well,
you
have
got
to
balance
my
interests
against
the
other.
justice
stevens
in
doing
the
balancing
under
your
view,
would
the
judge's
doubts
about
the
credibility
of
the
witness
be
a
factor
that
he
could
weigh,
and
here
the
judge
did
express
such
doubts?
justice
stevens
that
part
of
his
testimony
is
inherently
improbable.
justice
stevens
but
there
is
really
more
than
that
at
stake,
it
seems
to
me,
there
also.
in
every
case,
when
you
get
your
witnesses
in
the
courtroom
and
you
have
got
the
jury
in
the
box
and
you
are
all
ready
to
go,
and
then
something
like
this
happens,
and
there
is
a
request
for
a
continuance,
automatically
there
is
prejudice
to
the
whole
process,
if
you
have
to
send
everybody
home
and
you
do
not
know
whether
you
will
get
the
witnesses
back
three
days
later.
there
is
inherently
prejudice
in
every
case
with
a
last
minute
continuance,
is
there
not?
and
plus
after,
you
have
to
verify
the
man's
story.
justice
stevens
i
know,
and
they
are
not
a
healthy
thing.
justice
stevens
to
take
once
again
the
application
of
your
sixth
amendment
theory
to
hearsay.
if
wormley
was
not
present
but
you
tried
to
introduce
someone
who
said,
well,
wormley
is
not
here
but
wormley
told
me
that
he
saw
thus
and
so
affirming
your
client's
version
of
the
facts,
do
you
think
that
the
court
could
not
just
immediately
say
i
am
sorry,
we
have
a
rule
against
hearsay
evidence
because
we
think
that
it
is
not
sufficient?
justice
stevens
how
can
you
say
that
there
is
no
question
of
unreliability,
if
the
state
says
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
want
you
identify
your
witnesses
in
advance
is
so
that
the
other
side
will
have
a
chance
to
do
the
investigation
that
is
necessary
to
determine
their
credibility?
justice
stevens
it
is
designed
in
part
for
reliability
purposes.
justice
stevens
well,
there
are
the
same
other
remedies
in
the
hearsay
example.
justice
stevens
no,
of
course
not.
but
they
at
least
could
have
found
out
who
he
was.
justice
stevens
whether
he
was
at
the
scene,
and
i
guess
that
he
was
not
in
concurrence
with
the
scene.
justice
stevens
well,
yes.
justice
stevens
mr.
shabat,
if
you
believe
that
the
victim
was
armed
and
his
brother
was
armed,
or
at
least
his
brother,
when
they
testified
to
the
contrary
and
that
the
only
gun
was
that
of
the
defendant,
and
if
you
believe
the
man,
it
would
really
change
the
facts
quite
a
bit.
justice
stevens
perhaps
it
really
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
issue,
but
was
this
retained
counsel,
defendant's
counsel,
or
was
this
appointed
counsel?
justice
stevens
retained
counsel?
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
about
this
repetitious
problem
that
happened
over
and
over
again.
in
your
view,
was
the
judge
saying
that
this
is
significant
because
it
is
a
nuisance
to
the
court
to
have
to
grant
repeated
continuances,
or
do
you
read
him
as
saying
that
there
is
some
problem
about
the
risk
that
some
unscrupulous
lawyers
may
try
to
be
fabricating
false
testimony?
justice
stevens
because
i
suppose
that
if
you
look
at
it
as
the
latter
as
part
of
the
problem,
then
the
rather
shabby
behavior
of
this
lawyer
is
relevant
and
perhaps
partially
attributable
to
his
client.
