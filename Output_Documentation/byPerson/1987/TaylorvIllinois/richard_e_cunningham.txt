mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state's
use
of
a
preclusion
sanction
as
to
relevant
probative
testimony
of
a
defense
witness
in
order
to
enforce
its
discovery
rules
violated
the
compulsory
process
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
on
the
second
day
of
a
four
day
jury
trial,
defense
counsel
sought
to
amend
his
list
of
witnesses
to
include
the
witness
alfred
wormley.
the
trial
judge
reserved
his
ruling
on
this
request
until
the
following
morning.
at
that
time,
the
court
ordered
that
the
witness
testify
under
oath
as
an
offer
of
proof
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
the
witness'
testimony
was
subjected
to
cross-examination
by
both
the
prosecutor
and
the
court.
after
hearing
this
testimony
and
arguments,
the
court
found
that
there
had
been
a
blatant
and
willful
violation
of
the
discovery
rules.
the
court
ordered
that
the
witness
be
precluded
from
testifying
stating,
"i
feel
that
defense
attorneys
have
been
violating
discovery
in
this
courtroom
in
the
last
three
or
four
cases
blatantly,
and
i
am
going
to
put
a
stop
to
it,
and
this
is
one
way
to
do
so.
"
he
further
remarked
that
he
was
considering
reporting
the
defense
attorney
to
the
disciplinary
commission,
and
that
he
did
not
think
that
any
attorney
should
violate
any
orders
purposefully
to
get
an
edge
for
his
client.
it
is
our
position
that
the
court's
exclusion
of
the
witness
was
arbitrary
and
that
it
violated
the
sixth
amendment.
although
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
the
preclusion
sanction
would
ever
be
constitutionally
permissible,
all
parties
are
in
agreement
at
the
very
least
that
before
the
sanction
may
be
employed
that
a
balancing
test
must
be
used
to
determine
whether
the
state's
interest
in
using
preclusion
outweighs
the
defendant's
right
to
present
his
defense
witnesses.
the
balancing
test
that
we
urge
this
court
to
adopt
is
the
one
that
has
been
employed
by
the
vast
majority
of
lower
courts
addressing
this
issue.
that
test
begins
with
a
presumption
against
exclusion
of
otherwise
admissible
defense
evidence.
the
presumption
is
required
because
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
system
depends
on
a
full
and
fair
disclosure
of
the
defendant's
version
of
the
facts
as
well
as
the
state's,
so
that
the
jury
may
be
decide
where
the
truth
lies.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
we
have
to
look
at
the
intent
of
the
discovery
rules.
the
main
intent
of
the
discovery
rules
is
to
prevent
surprise
for
the
other
party.
and
when
the
rule
has
not
been
complied
with,
we
feel
that
the
proper
steps
that
a
court
should
take
is
to
see
that
the
other
party
be
made
whole
in
terms
of
surprise.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
it
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
i
would
point
out
in
that
regard
that
in
illinois
that
there
is
a
long
line
of
cases
that
were
the
state
has
violated
the
discovery
rules
and
seeks
to
now
put
what
would
be
termed
a
surprise
witness
before
the
court
that
if
the
defendant
simply
objects
and
asks
for
a
preclusion
and
the
court
then
admits
the
testimony,
on
appeal
the
defendant
has
waived
his
right
to
appeal
if
he
has
not
requested
a
continuance.
because
the
courts
in
illinois
hold
that
that
is
conclusive
evidence
that
the
defendant
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
admission
of
the
testimony,
since
the
defendant
did
not
even
indicate
that
he
needed
a
continuance
to
prepare
for
that
witness'
testimony.
i
am
not
saying
that
a
continuance
in
every
case
would
be
the
proper
remedy.
certainly,
in
the
instant
case,
i
do
not
think
that
the
state
even
needed
a
continuance
here.
once
it
heard
what
the
witness'
testimony
was
going
to
be,
it
then
had
before
it
and
knew
what
witnesses
it
needed
in
order
to
reflect
that
testimony.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not
saying
that.
i
am
saying
that--
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
--i
am
not
saying
that
either,
your
honor.
again
it
would
depend
on
each
case.
i
certainly
believe,
again
to
get
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
no
continuance
was
required
at
all
in
order
to
make
the
state
whole.
the
illinois
discovery
rules,
i
might
point
out,
provide
that
a
continuance
is
one
of
the
remedies.
but
another
remedy
is
that
the
other
party
be
put
on
notice
as
to
what
the
material
is
that
needs
to
be
discovered.
in
this
case,
we
had
the
perfect
remedy.
we
had
the
state
hearing
under
oath
what
the
testimony
of
that
witness
was
going
to
be.
we
had
the
state
able
to
cross-examine
that
witness.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
witness
testified
that
he
had
observed
and
heard
the
state
witnesses
plotting
to
go
after
ray
taylor
in
this
case,
and
that
he
had
observed
the
state
witnesses
with
pistols.
those
were
the
very
witnesses
present
at
court
that
day
testifying
for
the
state.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
your
honor,
certainly
if
the
prosecution
believed
that
they
had
other
evidence
that
needed
to
be
investigated,
they
could
request
a
continuance.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
our
argument
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
state.
the
state
is
seeking
to
preclude
the
defendant
from
presenting
a
witness.
that
is
a
constitutional
right
provided
to
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
we
believe
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state,
your
honor,
because
it
is
the
state
that
is
seeking
to
preclude
the
witness
from
testifying.
now
as
the
rules
themselves
provide,
exclusion
is
not
the
only
remedy.
the
committee
comments
to
the
rules
and
notes
that
there
might
be
constitutional
problems
if
the
defense
was
precluded
from
presenting
a
witness.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
my
answer
is
that
the
court
should
endeavor
to
ensure
that
the
defense
is
able
to
present
its
witnesses.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
it
would
depend.
if
the
defense
had
never
gotten
a
continuance
in
the
past
and
if
it
was
only
going
to
be
a
one
day
continuance,
i
think
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
the
court's
discretion
and
a
violation
of
the
constitution
to
not
grant
that
continuance.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
that
is
exactly
what
the
judge
said
here,
not
to
that
counsel
personally,
but
he
said
that
it
had
been
happening
in
his
courtroom
over
and
over.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
he
said
that
this
had
happened
in
three
or
four
other
cases.
i
do
not
think
that
he
was
talking
about
that
counsel.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
that
he
was.
he
mentioned
that
it
had
happened
in
other
cases
previously.
our
position
is
that
the
remedy
that
he
contemplated
and
then
abandoned
would
be
the
appropriate
remedy
in
that
case.
and
that
is
that
he
was
considering
reporting
the
attorney
to
the
disciplinary
commission.
we
feel
that
disciplinary
sanctions
of
the
attorney
is
the
appropriate
remedy
where
the
court
is
seeking
to
deter
other
attorneys
from
failing
to
comply
with
discovery
rules.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
i
think
that
the
case
may
well
be
different,
your
honor.
there
are
other
factors
to
consider
too.
but
the
case...
it
could
well
be
that
if
the
defendant
himself
was
the
one
who
had
brought
about
this
delay
purposefully
in
order
to
inject
what
appeared
to
be
perjured
testimony,
that
if
you
combined
that
with
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
state
was
going
to
be
prejudiced
and
was
not
going
to
be
able
to
be
prepared
through
the
use
of
other
sanctions,
then
perhaps
the
preclusion
sanction
would
be
appropriate.
we
certainly
do
not
have
that
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
we
have
taken
that
position
in
our
brief.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
we
have
taken
that.
and
we
are
taking
as
our
second
position
that
even
if
it
is
not
appropriate
that
the
balancing
test
must
be
employed
in
which
there
is
a
presumption
against
preclusion.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
as
i
pointed
out
in
braswell
v.
wainwright,
the
fifth
circuit
suggested
that
perhaps
if
it
were
so
flagrant
that
could
be
construed
as
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
by
the
defendant
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
present
witnesses
and
that
would
be
approached
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
recent
second
circuit
opinion
in
escalera
v.
coombe
and
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
fendler
v.
goldsmith
are
correct
on
this
point,
that
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
to
put
upon
a
defendant,
an
innocent
defendant,
his
counsel's
bad
faith
in
this
situation.
because
another
reason
for
that
would
be,
as
this
court
recognized
recently
in
rock
v.
arkansas
in
citing
ferata
v.
california,
that
this
court
noted
that
the
right
to
compulsory
process
is
a
personal
right
to
the
defendant
and
is
not
a
right
of
counsel.
the
test
which
we
propose
begins
with
a
presumption
against
exclusion
of
otherwise
admissible
defense
evidence.
the
presumption
is
required
because
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process...
i
am
sorry,
i
mentioned
that.
the
denial
of
the
defendant's
right
calls
into
question
the
ultimate
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process,
and
requires
that
the
competing
interest
be
closely
examined.
maximum
truth
gathering
rather
than
arbitrary
limitation
ought
to
be
the
goal.
put
another
way,
the
presumption
against
exclusion
puts
the
burden
on
the
state
to
demonstrate
a
compelling
interest
which
requires
the
denial
of
the
right.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
exactly,
and
that
is
the
truth
gathering
system
that
i
am
referring
to.
that
both
sides
ought
to
be
able
to
present
their
full
case.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
no.
that
was
not
the
basis
for
the
court's
ruling.
i
read
the
basis.
the
main
basis
for
the
court's
ruling
was
to
act
as
a
deterrent
in
other
cases.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
but
if
that
test
is
going
to
be
applied,
if
it
is
going
to
almost
be
a
per
se
preclusion
every
time
the
defense
violates
discovery
such
as
it
did
in
this
case,
then
we
are
not
recognizing
any
longer
the
importance
of
the
sixth
amendment
right.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
rules
take
precedence
over
the
right.
certainly,
the
right
is
above
it.
in
any
event,
i
think
that
when
anyone
is
seeking,
as
the
state
was
seeking
here,
to
abridge
that
right
that
the
burden
has
to
be
on
the
state
to
show
that
there
were
no
other
remedies
to
make
the
state
whole.
and
here
the
state
has
totally
failed
to
do
that.
it
never
argued
in
the
trial
court
that
it
was
not
prepared
to
meet
mr.
wormley's
testimony
once
it
had
heard
that
testimony.
and
our
argument
is
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state.
if
it
is
seeking
to
abridge
the
sixth
amendment
right,
it
has
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
a
compelling
interest
on
the
other
side
for
the
abridgement.
to
do
that,
the
state
had
to
show
that
it
could
not
have
met
that
testimony.
there
were
other
effective
remedies
that
would
have
fully
met
the
intent
of
the
discovery
rules
here.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
there
was
an
exception
taken
in
the
trial
court,
and
it
was
noted
in
the
post-trial
motion.
in
the
appellate
court--
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
--that
is
correct.
in
the
appellate
court,
the
state
is
arguing
that
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
that
the
issue
we
raised
below
is
a
different
issue
than
the
one
that
we
are
raising
here.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
yes,
i
do.
the
state
does
not
question
that
we
preserved
a
due
process
claim.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
in
the
appellate
court,
we
cited
the
due
process
clause.
not
in
our
original
appellate
brief,
we
did
not
specifically
cite
either
the
sixth
amendment
or
the
compulsory
process
clause.
however,
we
did
cite
washington
v.
texas
and
chambers
v.
mississippi,
two
compulsory
process
clause
cases
as
our
main
authority
along
with
an
illinois
case,
people
v.
rayford,
which
the
solicitor
general
has
agreed
is
a
compulsory
process
case.
our
position
is
that
the
case
law
of
this
court
makes
clear
that
the
question
is
whether
the
substance
of
the
federal
claim
below
is
the
same
as
the
substance
of
the
federal
claim
presented
here,
and
our
position
is
that
it
was.
we
did
in
fact
cite
the
sixth
amendment
in
our
rehearing
petition
to
the
appellate
court,
and
then
we
cited
it
in
our
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
but
as
i
said,
the
case
law
makes
it
clear
that
it
is
a
question
of
the
substance
of
the
federal
claim,
and
we
did
not
have
to
cite
book
and
verse
on
the
constitution.
we
did
properly
preserve
the
claim
by
citing
the
due
process
claim.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
at
the
time
of
his
ruling,
the
defense
attorney
did
not,
but
the
state
has
not
contested
that.
there
was
no
issue
raised
in
the
appellate
brief
that
the
issue
had
been
waived
certainly.
and
when
i
orally
argued
the
case,
there
was
no
question.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
it
is
not
the
burden
of
the
client,
not
the
burden
of
the
defendant,
i
am
sorry,
to
impose
upon
the
court
that
balancing
test.
the
court
has
that
duty.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
he
said,
for
what
it
is
worth,
he
expressed
some
doubt
about
a
portion
of
the
credibility.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
no,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
is
for
the
jury
to
determine.
this
court
has
made
that
clear
time
and
time
again
in
rock
v.
arkansas,
and
chambers
v.
mississippi.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
--i
do
not
believe
that
in
the
trial
court
that
should
be
permissible,
frankly.
but
i
believe
that
certainly
there
is
a
harmless
error
analysis
to
any
of
these
case,
i
would
agree.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
the
standard
would
be
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
as
it
is
in
schneble
v.
florida.
in
this
case
though,
to
get
to
the
balancing
test
if
we
can
for
a
moment,
keeping
in
mind
that
there
should
be
a
presumption
against
preclusion
in
applying
the
test.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
your
honor,
the
rule
that
we
are
talking
about--
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
--the
rule
that
we
are
talking
about--
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
--the
illinois
statute,
the
illinois
discovery
statutes,
do
not
require
preclusion,
your
honor.
the
illinois
statute--
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
--well,
that
is
our
argument.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
that
would
be
a
mechanistic
approach.
that
would
be
a
totally
arbitrary
rule
to
just
exclude.
every
time
that
the
defense
violates
discovery,
to
exclude
the
witness
would
be
a
mechanistic
approach.
as
i
say,
there
is
a
long
line
of
illinois
cases
where
the
state
violates
the
rule,
where
if
the
defendant
only
objects
and
asks
for
preclusion
and
the
judge
goes
forward
and
allows
the
witness
to
testify,
that
the
courts
on
appeal
then
hold
that
there
is
no
error.
they
hold
that
because
the
defense
failed
to
ask
for
a
continuance
that
is
conclusive
proof
that
there
has
been
no
prejudice.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
no,
it
was
the
state
who
failed
to
ask
for
a
continuance
or
failed
to
demonstrate
in
any
manner
that
it
was
going
to
be
prejudiced
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
your
honor,
to
put
it
on
the
defendant
would
be
very
difficult,
because
he
does
not
know
what
position
is
in
in
terms
of
prejudice.
the
defendant
would
not
be
able
to
articulate
to
the
court
why
it
is
that
the
state
is
not
prejudiced
or
why
it
is
that
the
state
does
not
need
a
continuance.
it
is
up
to
the
state
who
is
seeking
to
preclude.
if
you
look
at
the
colloquy,
it
was
the
state
arguing
very
strongly
that
this
witness
should
be
precluded
because
of
a
flagrant
violation
of
discovery.
it
should
have
been
the
state's
burden
to
articulate
to
the
court
why
it
was
that
lesser
sanctions
would
not
apply
here.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
i
think
that
we
should
look
at
the
intent
of
the
rules.
the
rules
are
not
just
set
up
to
be
applied
in
a
mechanistic
fashion.
the
rules
are
set
up
to
ensure
that
neither
party
will
be
surprised,
that
both
parties
can
prepare
for
the
testimony
of
the
other
side's
witnesses.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
i
think
that
we
have
to
maybe
measure
what
the
quantum
of
prejudice
is
when
you
say
that
in
every
continuance
there
is
prejudice.
there
are
continuances
in
jury
trials
in
cook
county
day
after
day
after
day
after
day
and
in
the
middle
of
trials
too,
i
might
add.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
so
i
think
that
we
have
to
take
a
realistic
view.
i
mean
the
point
is
that
the
defense
is
being
precluded
from
presenting
relevant
probative
testimony,
as
was
done
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that
you
have
to
weigh
that
against
whatever
prejudice
there
will
be.
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
in
this
particular
case
that
the
witnesses
needed
to
rebut
mr.
wormley's
testimony.
maybe
if
i
could
briefly
discuss
what
the
testimony
was.
the
issue
in
this
case
was
a
credibility
question
of
who
shot
the
complaining
witness,
jack
bridges.
the
state's
witnesses
were
jack
bridges
and
his
three
relatives.
they
stated
that
ray
taylor
had
shot
him
during
a
fight
that
mr.
bridges
and
his
relatives
were
having
with
ray
taylor
and
his
friends.
the
defense
presented
two
witnesses,
two
eyewitnesses
to
the
event,
who
testified
that
ray
taylor
was
not
armed
during
the
event,
that
it
was
jack
bridges'
brother
who
fired
shots
into
the
crowd
trying
to
protect
jack
bridges
and
who
shot
jack
bridges.
mr.
wormley,
also
i
might
add
that
bridges
and
bethany,
his
brother,
had
both
testified
that
they
were
unarmed
on
that
night.
mr.
wormley,
the
excluded
witness,
would
have
testified
that
prior
to
the
incident
sometime
earlier
in
the
evening
that
he
joined
a
group
of
people
including
jack
bridges
and
his
family
on
the
porch
of
bridges'
sister.
he
had
observed
bridges
handing
a
blanket
containing
two
pistols
to
his
girlfriend.
and
he
had
further
overhead
bridges
and
his
family
discussing
how
they
were
going
to
go
after
ray
taylor.
now
this
testimony
was
very
crucial
to
the
defense.
number
one,
it
corroborated
the
other
two
witnesses,
and
it
was
an
independent
source
of
corroboration
in
that
it
occurred
at
a
different
time
and
at
a
different
location.
number
two,
it
directly
rebutted
the
testimony
of
bridges
and
bethany
that
they
were
unarmed
on
that
night.
and
number
three,
it
added
an
element
to
the
defense's
case
which
was
totally
lacking,
and
that
is
the
element
of
planned
aggression
on
the
part
of
bridges
and
his
family.
so
this
testimony
was
crucial
to
the
defense.
now
once
the
state
had
heard
all
of
that
testimony
and
the
offer
or
proof,
they
were
no
longer
surprise,
and
surprise
is
the
main
thing
that
we
are
looking
to
overcome.
at
that
point,
they
were
no
longer
surprised.
also
i
might
add,
at
that
point
in
the
trial,
there
were
still
three
of
the
state
witnesses
to
be
presented,
and
all
of
the
defense
to
be
presented.
the
trial
did
not
end
until
the
following
day.
so
at
that
point,
the
state
basically
knew
the
witnesses
that
it
needed
to
rebut
mr.
wormley's
testimony.
they
needed
the
complaining
witness
and
his
family
who
were
all
present
there.
now
if
from
talking
to
them
they
felt
that
they
needed
additional
witnesses,
then
they
could
inform
the
court
as
to
what
they
needed
and
how
much
time
they
needed.
and
then
perhaps
the
court
could
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
that
would
be
so
prejudicial
to
the
state
to
have
to
grant
a
continuance
at
that
time
that
he
would
consider
precluding
the
witness.
but
absent
any
showing
at
all
that
the
state
was
going
to
be
prejudiced,
we
feel
that
this
court
must
find
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
i
think
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
other
factors.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
i
think
so,
case
by
case.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
yes.
i
was
not
saying
that
they
could
admit
the
hearsay.
i
was
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
no,
i
am
saying
that
you
would
have
to
look
at
it
case
by
case.
if
the
defense
had
been
causing
a
lot
of
continuances.
if
the
continuance
in
that
case
if
it
could
be
shown
would
severely
prejudice
the
state,
then
perhaps.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
perhaps
he
could,
your
honor.
that
is
not
the
case
that
we
have
here.
here
we
have--
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
--well,
that
is
true.
the
interesting
thing
here
is
that
unlike
chambers,
or
washington,
or
rock,
we
do
not
have
a
case
here
where
the
reason
that
the
state
was
seeking
to
preclude
the
evidence
was
that
they
believed
that
the
evidence
was
inherently
unreliable.
and
i
think
that
is
what
makes
this
such
a
stronger
case
than
those
other
cases.
here
we
have
a
witness
prepared
to
testify,
a
competent
witness
who
could
give
relevant
evidence
of
matters
that
he
observed.
there
is
no
question
of
inherent
unreliability
whatsoever.
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
the
state
could
be
prepared
to
meet
that
evidence.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
what
i
am
saying--
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
--what
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
other
remedies
for
the
state
to
be
made
whole
so
that
they
would
be
put
into
that
position.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
let
me
give
an
example,
your
honor.
if
the
defense
had
complied
with
discovery
in
this
case
and
had
given
the
witness'
name
to
the
state,
the
witness
would
have
had
no
obligation
to
talk
to
the
state
whatsoever.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
so
they
would
have
known
who
he
was.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
but
instead
of
that
what
the
state
got
was
that
they
got
his
full
testimony
under
oath.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
so
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
are
other
remedies,
other
less
severe
remedies,
that
we
feel
are
appropriate
certainly
in
this
case.
and
to
impose
a
preclusion
sanction
here
would
be
arbitrary.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
not
in
illinois,
no.
if
you
have
no
other
questions,
i
will
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
thank
you,
your
honor.
justice
scalia,
in
answer
to
your
question
which
i
was
never
able
to
get
to,
it
is
true
that
all
parties
including
the
solicitor
general
agree
that
a
balancing
test
must
be
applied.
in
this
case,
it
clearly
was
never
applied
by
the
trial
judge
unlike
what
was
going
on
in
illinois
since
people
v.
rayford
in
1976.
we
ask
that
this
court
apply
the
balancing
test.
and
if
it
does
so,
i
think
that
the
defense
will
win
the
case.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
your
honor,
we
have
raised
in
effect
with
assistance
of
counsel,
we
raised
it
before
this
court,
and
this
court
chose
to
only
accept
the
case
on
question
one.
so
unlike
the
state
said,
we
certainly
argued
in
effect
with
assistance
of
counsel
in
this
case.
but
again
the
burden
should
be
on
the
court
to
apply
that
balancing
test
in
any
event.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
i
think
that
he
could
think
it
through.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
except
the
evidence
of
prejudice
would
have
to
appear
of
record.
and
here
we
have
no
evidence
that
the
state
would
have
been
prejudiced
had
mr.
wormley
been
allowed
to
testify.
here
we
have
no
evidence
that
less
severe
sanctions
would
not
have
been
appropriate.
and
in
answer
to
another
one
of
your
questions
about
the
materiality
of
the
witness,
yes,
that
is
part
of
the
balancing
test.
and
here
i
believe
that
we
have
demonstrated
that
this
witness
was
highly
material.
i
might
add
that
the
jury
went
out
to
deliberate
and
came
back
and
sent
a
message
requesting
the
testimony
of
the
complaining
witness
and
his
brother.
it
was
not
until
after
they
had
reviewed
that
testimony
until
they
returned
a
verdict
of
guilt.
this
is
a
very
close
credibility
case.
as
to
the
fact
that
the
record
is
clear
that
mr.
taylor
was
not
responsible
here
for
his
attorneys
at
best
negligence,
there
is
no
question
about
it.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
well,
the
state
never
argued
that
below.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
we
do
know.
the
lawyer
said
that
the
defendant
had
told
him
long
before
trial
of
the
existence
of
mr.
wormley,
and
we
know
that
the
lawyer
interviewed
mr.
wormley
at
his
home
a
week
before
trial
and
served
him
with
a
subpoena.
i
do
not
think
that
on
those
facts
that
it
is
at
all
fair
to
an
uneducated
criminal
defendant
twenty
years
old
to
put
onto
him
that
he
was
somehow
aware
of
what
these
discovery
rules
were
about.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
the
supreme
court
denied
the
petition
for
leave
to
appeal.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
the
appellate
court
affirmed,
the
appellate
court
might
also
+/-
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
and
the
appellate
court
again
totally
failed
to
apply
any
kind
of
balancing
test
at
all.
they
simply
said
that
preclusion
was
one
of
the
sanctions
permitted
by
the
statute
based
on
the
flagrancy
of
the
violation,
and
we
find
no
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
i
was
the
appeal
counsel
for
my
client.
mr.
richard
e.
cunningham
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
i
argued
the
case
of
enoch
v.
hartigan
to
the
appellate
court
which
is
a
sixth
amendment
case.
i
argued
washington
v.
texas,
and
chambers
v.
mississippi.
i
argued
people
v.
rayford,
which
the
solicitor
general
recognizes
as
a
balancing
test
sixth
amendment
case.
i
made
all
of
those
arguments
to
the
appellate
court,
your
honor.
it
is
in
our
briefs,
and
i
orally
argued
those
arguments.
