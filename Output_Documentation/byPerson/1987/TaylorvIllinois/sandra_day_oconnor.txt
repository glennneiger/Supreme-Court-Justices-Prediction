justice
o'connor
mr.
cunningham,
may
i
inquire,
please,
when
the
compulsory
process
claim
was
presented
to
the
courts
below?
i
have
no
found
any
reference
to
it.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
never
under
the
rubric
of
a
compulsory
process
claim?
justice
o'connor
and
it
did
seem
to
be.
i
just
wondered
i
you
had
any
comment.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
does
the
state
have
no
right
to
depose
a
listed
witness
in
illinois?
justice
o'connor
did
you
not
argue
that
we
should
overrule
washington
v.
texas?
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
took
a
little
more
extreme
position
maybe
in
the
brief.
justice
o'connor
mr.
shabat,
does
it
make
any
difference
in
the
balancing
how
crucial
the
evidence
is
that
the
witness
intends
to
give,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
how
important
was
this
evidence?
