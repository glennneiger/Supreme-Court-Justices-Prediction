justice
marshall
mr.
cunningham,
what
do
you
do
at
the
point
where
the
court
says
you
have
been
doing
this
over,
and
over,
and
over
again
and
i
have
got
to
stop
it?
justice
marshall
the
way
that
i
read
it
he
was
talking
about
that
lawyer.
justice
marshall
and
also
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
rule.
justice
marshall
you
have
got
two
presumptions
here.
one
is
the
rule
is
good
unless
you
say
it
is
bad,
and
you
have
to
prove
that
it
is
bad.
justice
marshall
so
you
are
going
to
put
the
burden
on
the
state
to
prove
that
it
is
good,
how
do
you
do
that?
justice
marshall
but
the
judge
does.
justice
marshall
that
is
the
rule.
justice
marshall
but
the
defendant
did
not
ask
for
that
in
this
case.
justice
marshall
well,
did
defendant
have
no
responsibility
at
all?
justice
marshall
i
do
not
see
where
you
shift
the
burden
here.
i
think
that
the
burden,
of
course,
is
on
the
state
to
prove
its
case,
but
there
is
also
a
shift
in
responsibility
when
the
rules
say
that
you
should
do
this
and
you
do
not
do
this.
justice
marshall
does
that
answer
the
petitioner's
repeated
point
about
that
you
could
have
gotten
a
postponement
of
a
day
or
so,
do
you
think
that
your
last
answer
answers
that?
justice
marshall
trials
have
been
interrupted
before
in
illinois
and
chicago,
have
been
interrupted
in
the
middle
of
a
trial,
right?
i
assume
so
in
every
city
that
i
have
ever
heard
of.
justice
marshall
but
you
could
have
had
the
continuance
come
after
the
state's
case
in
chief,
could
you
not,
because
wormley
was
not
going
to
be
called
until
the
defense
case.
justice
marshall
that
does
not
happen
in
all
criminal
cases.
justice
marshall
have
you
not
ever
heard
of
a
criminal
case
where
the
lawyer
says
you
are
the
arresting
officer,
well
tell
what
happened?
that
does
not
show
any
investigation.
justice
marshall
if
they
waited
two
days
or
one
day,
there
could
have
been
a
preliminary
investigation,
could
there
not?
you
have
an
efficient
police
department.
justice
marshall
we
all
understand.
you
do
not
have
to
keep
saying
in
the
middle
of
a
trial.
we
know
exactly
what
it
means.
justice
marshall
well,
let
me
ask
you
then.
justice
marshall
if
this
happened
on
the
first
day,
would
you
be
in
favor
of
a
postponement,
a
continuance?
justice
marshall
well,
do
you
want
this
to
be
a
case
limited
to
the
facts
in
this
case?
justice
marshall
if
you
do
not
want
it
limited
to
facts
in
this
case,
then
stop
emphasizing
these
facts.
mr.
shabat,
i
have
another
problem
relating
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
if
this
whole
thing
is
to
be
decided
on
a
balancing
test,
as
you
say,
should
we
not
require
that
the
judge
in
fact
conduct
a
balancing
test,
and
what
evidence
do
we
have
that
he
conduced
any
balancing
test
here?
he
did
not
even
receive
an
objection
from
the
prosecution
to
the
effect
that
we
think
that
this
evidence
is
unreliable
and
we
want
to
interview
some
witnesses.
i
mean
all
of
these
great
and
serious
reasons
you
are
giving
us
now
are
brain
spun.
they
were
not
brought
before
the
district
judge
at
the
time.
