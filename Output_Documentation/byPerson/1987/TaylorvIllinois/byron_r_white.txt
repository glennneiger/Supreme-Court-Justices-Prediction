i
take
it
then
that
you
are
saying
then
that
preclusion
is
automatically
justified
in
every
single
case
of
noncompliance?
justice
white
that
may
be
the
state
rule,
but
is
it
your
position
that
the
sixth
amendment
would
never,
never
forbid
preclusion?
justice
white
sometimes?
justice
white
what
are
they,
just
name
one?
justice
white
let's
take
it,
would...
would
the
sixth
amendment
ever
forbid
preclusion
where
there
is
a
failure
to
reveal
a
name
of
a
witness
in
compliance
with
the
rule?
justice
white
so
do
you
think
that
there
is
a
balancing
process
that
must
go
on
in
every
case?
