was
this
a
new
practitioner,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that
your
generation
did
not
know
him,
but
the
younger
generation
did?
unknown
speaker
he
only
tried
young
cases
or
what,
i
do
not
understand.
unknown
speaker
if
it
has
been
going
on
illinois
since
1976,
why
did
not
anybody
ask
the
trial
judge
and
this
court
do
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that
the
balancing
has
to
be
articulated
and
made
on
the
record?
unknown
speaker
or
can
the
trial
judge
just
think
it
through
and
weigh
the
pros
and
the
cons
and
the
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
say
that,
how
can
you
say
that
it
is
clear,
maybe
they
did
not
prove
it,
but
how
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
they
do
not
know.
the
defendant
never
testified
in
the
case,
and
you
do
not
know
what
he
said
to
his
lawyer,
and
what
the
lawyer
said
to
him.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
thought
that
the
trial
judge
did
enough,
it
affirmed.
unknown
speaker
the
appellate
court.
unknown
speaker
saying
that
it
was
a
matter
of
discretion
and
finding
no
fault
with
what
the
judge
did
or
said.
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
appeal,
counsel
for
your
client
was
not
arguing
for
a
balancing.
unknown
speaker
that
just
was
not
presented
as
a
compulsory
process
claim.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tuesday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
