mr.
michael
shabat
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
state
of
illinois
in
this
proceeding
is
that
when
a
defendant
as
petitioner
taylor
did
in
this
case
sought
to
compel
witnesses
to
attend
court,
he
did
so
understandably
in
an
effort
to
present
evidence
to
a
jury
which
was
going
to
decide
his
guilt
or
his
innocence.
in
the
course
of
doing
that
or
in
the
attempt
to
do
so,
it
is
incumbent
upon
defendants
as
well
as
prosecutors
in
this
country
to
do
so
with
compliance
with
established
procedures,
procedures
which
we
submit
assure
fairness
and
reliability
in
the
ascertainment
of
guilt
and
innocence.
it
is
not
merely
the
element
of
surprise
that
discovery
rules
address.
mr.
michael
shabat
your
honor,
the
record
reflects
that
at
the
time,
at
the
time
during
trial,
after
the
jury
had
been
selected,
after
opening
statements
by
both
the
state
and
the
defense,
and
after
two
of
the
state's
key
witnesses
had
testified
on
both
direct
and
cross-examination
that
the
court
sent
the
jury
home
until
the
next
day.
and
at
that
time,
the
defense
attorney
stated
that
he
had
just
learned
of
an
additional
witness
who
could
have
and
probably
did
see
the
entire
incident.
there
was
a
suggestion
implicit
in
that.
mr.
michael
shabat
i
suggest
that
it
can
be
inferred
that
when
he
learned,
when
the
defense
attorney
is
telling
the
court
that
he
learned,
although
we
do
not
know
directly
and
specifically
and
we
can
only
infer,
that
he
learned
it
from
his
client
who
was
sitting
there
at
counsel
table.
mr.
michael
shabat
there
is
no
direct
evidence
of
that,
that
is
correct.
in
the
attempt
to
avoid
surprise,
we
are
really
talking
about
more
than
that.
because
we
are
talking
about
an
effort
to
assure
fairness
and
reliability
in
the
ascertainment
of
guilt
and
innocence.
to
the
extent
that
the
sixth
amendment
may
be
implicated
in
that
or
notions
of
due
process,
it
does
not
permit
a
defendant
to
present
testimony
that
is
free
from
legitimate
demands.
the
discovery
rules
in
illinois
in
the
specific
instance
are
demands
of
an
adversary
system.
because
there
is
really
no
justification
for
a
defendant
under
the
guise
of
any
constitutional
right
to
attempt
to
assert
half
truths.
mr.
michael
shabat
no,
sir,
that
is
not
our
position.
preclusion
under
our
discovery
rules
in
illinois
and
in
most
of
the
states,
and
almost
all
of
the
states
have
such
rules,
preclusion
is
an
option.
it
is
an
option
among
other
options
which
a
judge
in
his
discretion
can,
must
use,
and
did
in
fact
use
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
shabat
no.
mr.
michael
shabat
there
are
circumstances,
there
are
circumstances.
mr.
michael
shabat
i
think
that
it
would
involve
a
circumstance
where
the
nature
of
the
violation,
for
example,
being
one
that
was
fairly
technical.
if,
for
example,
discovery
had
to
be
completed
within
a
given
jurisdiction
after
a
number
of
days,
but
in
any
event
well
before
the
parties
intended
to
go
to
trial.
mr.
michael
shabat
it
might.
it
might
after
a
determination
by
the
judge
of
all
of
the
factors
such
as
the
reason,
the
motivation
behind
the
failure.
mr.
michael
shabat
most
certainly,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
is
appropriate.
mr.
michael
shabat
well,
no,
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
believe
that
we
have
a
different
situation
here.
we
have
unreliable
evidence
in
that
instance.
and
i
do
not
believe
that--
mr.
michael
shabat
--in
this
case,
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
shabat
no.
prosecutors
must
have
an
opportunity
to
fully
investigate
their
case.
it
is
not
sufficient
for
a
prosecutor
to
have
to
sit
at
trial
after
having
prepared
his
case
and
investigated
the
evidence,
having
selected
a
jury,
having
selected
a
jury
i
might
add
with
a
mind
towards
the
type
of
witnesses
that
will
be
presented
during
the
case--
mr.
michael
shabat
--i
would
have
to
weigh
that
factor,
your
honor,
with
due
regard
to
the
other
factors
present
in
the
case
such
as
when
does
this
occur.
mr.
michael
shabat
that
is
essentially
what
the
defense
lawyer
tried
to
say.
because
on
the
very
next
page
after
he
has
just
indicated
that
he
just
learned
of
this
witness,
he
sort
of
retracts
that,
and
he
says
on
page
206
of
the
record
of
joint
appendix,
page
13,
"the
defendant
told
me
about
him
sometime
ago,
but
i
could
not
locate
him.
"
of
course,
that
does
not
relieve
him
of
an
obligation.
all
he
had
to
do
is
write
the
name
and
address
unknown,
and
that
would
have
satisfied
illinois
discovery.
mr.
michael
shabat
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
and
we
are
not
at
all
suggesting--
mr.
michael
shabat
--my
opponent,
i
believe,
is
arguing
that
a
preclusion
is
never
appropriate.
there
is
only
one
place
that
i
have
read
within
the
documents
filed
in
this
court
where
the
petitioner
indicates
that
there
might
be
a
rare
case
where
it
could
be
appropriate,
but
he
then
imposes
on
the
state
some
restrictions
in
that
regard
before
they
can
avail
themselves
of
that.
mr.
michael
shabat
in
the
brief
submitted
by
the
state
of
illinois,
we
suggested
that
based
on
our
historical
analysis
of
the
evolution
of
the
writing
of
the
compulsory
process
clause
that
perhaps
washington
v.
texas
should
be
reconsidered.
even
if
it
were
not
to
be
reconsidered,
it
is
our
view
that
only
arbitrary,
only
arbitrary
rules,
and
procedures,
or
statutes
which
interfere
with
the
compulsory
process
clause
ought
to
follow
that
clause.
this
is
not
an
arbitrary
procedure.
the
judge
has
discretion
to
choose
this
sanction
and
it
is
not
arbitrary
because
on
its
face
the
discovery
rule
which
provides
sanctions
here
in
illinois
provides
alternatives.
so
there
is
discretion
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
options
available
to
the
judge.
mr.
michael
shabat
it
is
possible.
it
would
depend
again
on
the
timing
of
that
discovery,
and
what
inferences
if
any
or
what
specific
conclusions
could
be
drawn
after
an
examination
of
the
attorney
in
court,
whether
it
was
designed
as
a
strategical
tactical
advantage,
an
improper
one
i
might
add,
or
whether
in
fact
it
was
merely
technical.
mr.
michael
shabat
that
would
certainly
weigh
in
favor
of
not
precluding.
mr.
michael
shabat
yes,
and
it
is
reciprocal
as
well.
mr.
michael
shabat
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
in
fact,
back
to
justice
brennan's
question,
when
the
defense
attorney
later
changed
his
mind
about
what
he
knew,
he
indicated
that
he
had
been
told
sometime
ago
about
alfred
wormley,
this
witness,
but
that
he
could
not
locate
him.
well,
the
next
day
at
the
judge's
request,
alfred
wormley
appeared
in
court.
this
was
communicated
to
the
defense
attorney
by
the
judge,
and
the
defense
attorney
brought
him
to
court
the
next
day.
and
prior
to
the
jury
coming
out
to
hear
the
third
state's
witness,
third,
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth,
alfred
wormley
was
voir
dired.
and
it
was
during
the
course
of
that
voir
dire
that
we
learned
that
in
fact
this
defense
attorney
had
visited
alfred
wormley,
this
newly
discovered
witness,
at
his
home
a
week
prior
to
the
commencement
of
trial,
a
week
before
they
picked
that
jury,
a
week
before
opening
statements,
a
week
and
a
day.
mr.
michael
shabat
yes,
it
can
and
it
should,
because
it
is
important.
mr.
michael
shabat
not
very,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
although
the
defendant
could
argue
that
there
is
some
conceivable
benefit,
some
conceivable
benefit
that
could
have
been
derived
from
this
testimony,
that
it
certainly
was
not
the
kind
of
testimony
which
having
been
excluded
and
reflecting
upon
the
entire
record
as
we
must
do
at
this
point
that
one
could
conclude
that
this
trial
was
unjust,
and
that
the
verdict
was
somehow
compromised
by
that.
mr.
michael
shabat
perhaps.
the
judge
had
an
opportunity,
although
not
the
best
opportunity,
to
observe
the
demeanor
of
this
witness
during
that
voir
dire.
in
fact,
he
concluded
that
he
did
not
believe
that
he
was
a
very
credible
witness.
and
i
think
that
great
weight
should
be
placed
on
that
given
these
circumstances
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
shabat
yes.
mr.
michael
shabat
i
believe
it
was,
yes.
mr.
michael
shabat
your
honor,
i
believe
that
a
continuance
would
have
been
inappropriate
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
i
do
not
believe
that
an
interruption
of
a
trial
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
is
in
the
interests
of
justice
and
truth
seeking.
the
jury
has
been
empaneled,
the
jury
has
heard
opening
statements,
the
jury
has
listened--
mr.
michael
shabat
--most
likely,
hopefully
not
for
this
reason
though.
but
in
any
event,
that
does
not
advance
the
efforts
of
the
participants
in
the
justice
system,
not
the
least
of
which
the
judge
has
a
tremendous
case
load
that
he
has
to
work
through,
that
is
being
forestalled
because
of
this
kind
of
conduct.
and
once
a
jury
is
listening
to
evidence
and
they
are
in
the
state's
case
in
chief,
i
think
that
it
is
fair
to
conclude
that
delays
that
occur
under
those
conditions
do
not
advance
the
interests
of
a
state
which
desires
to
proceed
witness
after
witness
to
conclusion
of
the
state's
case
in
chief.
mr.
michael
shabat
there
is
another
aspect
to
that,
your
honor.
yes,
that
could
have
happened.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
would
have
been
sufficient
either.
when
the
state
prepares
for
trial,
it
does
so
with
a
thorough
investigation
of
all
of
the
witnesses,
all
of
its
witnesses,
in
an
attempt
to
find
if
they
cannot
interview
because
a
witness
does
not
have
to
talk
to
the
state,
but
nevertheless
to
use
its
investigatory
resources
to
find
out
something
about
that
witness
in
some
detail
to
see
where
that
witness
really
was.
mr.
michael
shabat
what
is
that?
mr.
michael
shabat
well,
that--
mr.
michael
shabat
--yes,
i
believe
we
do.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
one
or
two
days
would
have
necessarily
been
sufficient
time.
and
i
also
do
not
believe
that
in
light
of
the
fact
that
we
are
in
the
middle
of
a
trial,
the
middle
of
a
trial,
where
a
jury
has
been
listening
to
evidence,
that
the
possibility
of
its
losing
its
train
of
thought--
mr.
michael
shabat
--i
think
that
is
central
to
my
argument,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
is
imperative
that
things
like
this
not
come
about
as
a
surprise
well
past
the
eleventh
hour.
i
think
that
for
that
reason
with
liberal
discovery
appropriate--
mr.
michael
shabat
--yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
shabat
if
by
the
first
day,
your
honor,
i
take
your
meaning
to
be
prior
to
the
selection
of
the
jury,
prior
to
opening
statements?
mr.
michael
shabat
no.
mr.
michael
shabat
your
honor,
i
believe
to
the
contrary,
that
we
have
a
record
here
that
shows
that
the
judge
was
if
not
specifically
articulating
any
of
the
criteria
that
we
have
discussed
today
as
part
of
his
decision
in
deciding
to
preclude
the
witness
that
he
was
fully
cognizant
of
the
actions
available
to
him.
he
also
by
his
deeds
did
not
only
preclude
a
witness,
alfred
wormley,
who
was
tendered
and
identified
to
the
state
when
he
was,
but
there
is
evidence
in
this
record
that
prior
to
trial
before
the
first
witness
was
called
but
after
jury
selection
that
the
defense
asked
leave
of
court
to
amend
his
list
of
witnesses
in
this
case
and
he
was
permitted
to
do
so,
and
they
were
not
excluded.
what
the
judge
did,
however,
in
that
instance
was
i
believe
a
very
measured
and
appropriate
response
from
which
i
derive
inference
that
he
was
conducting
a
balancing
approach.
he
told
the
state
that
for
those
witnesses
before
they
were
allowed
to
testify
that
time
would
be
taken
for
the
state
to
attempt
to
interview
them.
i
think
that
this
shows
a
measured
response
which
is
an
indication
of
his
cognizance
of
why
he
was
doing
what
he
did
and
what
was
available
to
him
beyond
that
which
he
did
for
any
of
the
witnesses
for
whom
discovery
was
an
issue
in
this
case.
and
i
also
believe
that
the
judge
was
weighing
in
his
mind
as
evidenced
by
his
words
the
problem
that
he
was
confronting
and
that
he
had
confronted,
and
that
other
judges
of
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
had
confronted
in
previous
cases,
where
surprise
ambush
defense
tactics
had
been
perpetrated
upon
the
state.
and
i
believe
that
a
sense
of
his
frustration
is
evidenced
by
this
record.
and
it
is
clear
to
us
that
he
was
attempting
to
devise
the
appropriate
sanction
or
remedy
to
be
applied
in
each
of
the
instances
of
belated
discovery
of
witnesses
to
the
state.
mr.
michael
shabat
yes
to
both.
i
would
answer
yes
to
both
of
those
questions.
mr.
michael
shabat
yes,
that
is
our
position.
we
believe
that
as
the
appellate
court
found
in
this
case
under
an
analysis
under
strickland
that
this
defense
attorney
was
competent.
that
issue
was
presented
to
the
appellate
court,
and
it
was
resolved
in
that
manner.
and
indeed,
he
was
competent.
he
presented
pre-trial
motions,
he
argued
them,
he
examined
witnesses
at
some
great
length,
and
put
on
witnesses
as
well.
this
was
not
the
kind
of
representation
that
one
could
ever
argue
was
incompetent.
mr.
michael
shabat
yes,
i
know
the
people
from
my
generation
in
our
felony
trial
courts.
we
are
not
familiar
with
him.
but
the
newer
people
who
are
trying
cases
today
in
our
felony
trial
courts
were
aware
of
his
presence
from
time
to
time
in
our
trial
courts
at
26th
and
california
in
chicago.
mr.
michael
shabat
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
shabat
the
obligation
that
was
placed
on
the
defendant
in
this
case
to
comply
with
discovery
was
certainly
not
burdensome
and
it
certainly
was
not
very
difficult.
the
answer
to
discovery
is
a
simple
document
to
prepare.
it
is
what
you
have
to
be
able
to
do
to
be
able
to
prepare
for
trial.
all
the
defense
attorney
had
to
do
here
was
to
respond
to
our
motion.
even
if
he
did
not
know
wormley's
address,
wormley
would
have
testified
had
timely
notice
of
his
name
been
given.
i
believe
that
the
value
of
compliance
here
not
just
to
the
state,
frankly,
but
to
the
criminal
justice
system,
and
specifically
here
the
jury
in
its
attempt
to
ascertain
the
truth
was
great.
no
surprise,
no
delay,
the
state
having
an
opportunity
to
fully
investigate
and
therefore
enhance
the
truth
seeking
function
at
trial.
we
perceive
the
defendant's
attempt
here
as
an
attempt
to
in
some
way
insulate
the
exercise
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
and
discovery
rules
from
imposition
of
any
legitimate
demands
of
our
adversary
system.
and
our
great
concern,
your
honors,
is
that
if
he
is
successful
here
that
he
is
going
to
effectively
emasculate
the
intent
of
our
discovery
rules,
rules
which
are
designed
for
both
sides,
to
afford
both
sides
an
enhanced
opportunity
to
prepare
their
case
and
present
their
evidence.
these
discovery
rules
are
liberal
rules,
and
they
are
appropriately
so.
in
illinois,
we
virtually
give
our
file
in
its
entirety
to
the
defendant
before
trial.
certainly,
given
that,
it
is
not
appropriate
under
due
process
or
the
sixth
amendment
for
the
defendant
to
be
able
to
obtain
an
advantage,
if
he
can
get
everything
and
go
to
trial
and
present
as
a
surprise
untested
evidence
even
though
he
has
violated
those
rules.
defendant's
violation
of
those
rules
were
very
flagrant
here.
i
believe
that
judge
acted
in
a
judicious,
tempered,
and
balanced
manner,
a
manner
which
did
not
affect
the
outcome
of
this
trial,
nor
could
it
be
said
that
the
absence
of
wormley's
testimony,
although
perhaps
there
is
a
conceivable
benefit
that
could
have
been
derived
from
it,
would
nevertheless
never
have
affected
the
integrity
of
the
verdict.
thank
you.
