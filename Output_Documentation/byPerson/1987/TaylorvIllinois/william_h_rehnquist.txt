chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cunningham,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
wish.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
integrity
of
the
system
depends
to
a
certain
extent
to
one
complying
with
rules
of
court
requiring
you
to
give
lists
of
witnesses.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
that
be
a
continuance?
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly,
the
prosecution
never
wants
a
continuance
in
a
criminal
case.
a
continuance
usually
is
almost
entirely
for
the
benefit
of
the
defendant.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
are
saying
in
effect
that
you
could
flagrantly,
as
the
trial
court
finds,
violate
the
rules
of
the
court
and
nothing
would
happen?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
the
system
would
work
in
other
cases,
that
advance
notice
and
ability
to
check
out
witnesses
would
occur
in
those
cases.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
sixth
amendment
right
is
such
as
the
justice
suggests
to
rules
of
evidence.
a
defendant
cannot
simply
come
up
with
any
piece
of
evidence
that
he
feels
is
relevant
and
say,
look,
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
me
the
right
to
place
this
before
the
jury.
it
is
all
subject
to
an
elaborate
system
of
rules.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
about
harmless
error?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean
if
one
were
to
find
that
there
may
be
a
violation
of
a
compulsory
process
clause
say
in
a
hypothetical
case,
but
the
witness'
testimony
was
so
tangential
or
so
minor
that
it
could
not
possibly
have
affected
the
outcome,
certainly
that
sort
of
a
review
for
harmless
error
would
be
permissible,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
an
appellate
court
reviewing
your
claim
could
say
true,
there
was
a
violation
of
the
compulsory
process
clause,
but
it
was
just
harmless
error.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cunningham.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
shabat.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shabat.
mr.
cunningham,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cunningham.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
86-5963,
taylor
against
illinois.
in
this
case
which
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
illinois
appellate
court
for
the
first
district,
we
hold
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
stevens
that
the
sixth
amendment's
compulsory
process
clause
does
not
absolutely
prohibit
a
trial
court
from
sanctioning
a
failure
to
comply
with
discovery
rules
by
barring
an
undisclosed
witness
from
testifying.
we
hold
also
the
petitioner's
sixth
amendment
rights
were
not
violated
since
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
this
is
one
of
the
extreme
cases
in
which
a
severe
sanction
is
appropriate.
the
violation
was
willful
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
violation
created
a
strong
inference
that
the
witnesses'
testimony
would
not
be
believable.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
and
justice
blackmun
joined.
justice
blackmun
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
