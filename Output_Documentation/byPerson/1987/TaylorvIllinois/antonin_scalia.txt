justice
scalia
at
worst
you
get
thrown
into
the
briar
patch,
that
is
you
get
a
continuance.
justice
scalia
what
about
getting
other
witnesses
to
impeach
that
witness?
justice
scalia
that
would
have
required
a
continuance,
would
it
not?
justice
scalia
what
about
getting
other
people
to
come
in
and
say
that
this
man
is
a
congenital
liar,
other
people
who
knew
this
witness?
justice
scalia
and
the
only
way
to
get
that
sort
of
evidence
would
have
been
a
continuance.
justice
scalia
if
you
are
in
violation
of
the
rules,
and
the
burden
is
on
the
state.
that
seems
strange.
justice
scalia
suppose
you
come
up
on
the
day
of
trial
with
hearsay
testimony,
and
the
judge
says
i
am
not
going
to
let
this
in
because
it
is
hearsay.
would
you
make
the
argument,
well,
it
is
important
evidence,
you
have
to
give
me
a
continuance
so
that
i
can
go
and
get
the
fellow
who
really
said
it
so
that
it
will
not
be
hearsay
anymore;
you
would
not
expect
to
get
a
continuance
for
that,
would
you?
you
have
simply
violated
the
rules
of
the
game
by
trying
to
introduce
hearsay
evidence
which
is
not
reliable
enough,
and
the
court
says
i
am
sorry,
we
are
going
to
move
ahead.
would
you
expect
a
continuance
to
be
able
to
go
and
get
the
original
declarer?
you
would
not.
justice
scalia
in
that
hearsay
case,
you
would
expect
a
continuance?
justice
scalia
it
sounds
to
me
like
the
inquisitorial
system,
not
the
adversarial
system
which
we
have.
i
mean
you
have
a
system
in
which
each
side.
justice
scalia
subject
to
certain
rules.
and
sometimes
you
break
a
rule
like
if
you
try
to
introduce
evidence
that
is
unreliable
because
it
is
hearsay,
and
it
is
simply
excluded.
justice
scalia
and
here
what
the
court
was
saying
is
this
evidence
is
unreliable,
because
it
has
not
been
subjected
to
the
testing
process
that
our
requirements
of
advance
notice
provide
for.
since
it
is
unreliable,
i
am
excluding
this.
justice
scalia
every
case,
case
by
case?
justice
scalia
no
absolute
rule
excluding
hearsay,
you
have
to
say,
well,
let's
see,
maybe
we
will
have
to
have
a
continuance
so
you
can
go
get
the
original
declarant,
go
get
wormley?
justice
scalia
no,
you
are
just
saying
that
you
are
entitled
to
a
continuance.
justice
scalia
the
judge
could
not
just
say
look
it,
today
is
the
trial
date,
you
know
what
the
rules
of
evidence
are,
you
should
have
been
here
with
your
evidence.
if
your
counsel
is
so
bad
that
he
has
tried
to
get
in
hearsay
when
he
should
have
had
the
original
declarant,
if
it
is
just
a
bad
mistake
that
it
amounts
to
ineffective
assistance,
you
can
have
that
relief,
but
this
trial
is
going
ahead,
a
judge
could
not
say
that?
justice
scalia
but
it
is
the
same
principle
that
you
are
urging
under
the
sixth
amendment,
that
the
rules
designed
to
assure
the
reliability
of
evidence
do
not
have
to
be
absolutely
followed.
but
in
each
case,
the
court
is
supposed
to
weigh
whether
bending
them
in
this
case
or
allowing
a
continuance
so
that
they
can
be
remedied
will
be
in
the
interests
of
justice.
that
is
basically
what
you
are
saying.
justice
scalia
the
same
in
hearsay,
of
course,
right,
the
same
with
hearsay,
because
i
mean
the
sixth
amendment
applies
to
that
too?
justice
scalia
i
thought
that
you
were
telling
us
that
part
of
the
purpose
of
this
rule
is
if
there
has
not
been
the
time
to
investigate
the
witness
that
the
evidence
is
unreliable.
i
thought
that
was
part
of
your
case.
justice
scalia
well,
just
in
this
case,
but
not
generally
under
these
rules?
justice
scalia
your
position
is
just
that
the
balancing
was
properly
done
here,
you
agree
that
there
has
to
be
balancing
in
every
case?
justice
scalia
there
is
not
much
of
a
dispute
really,
is
there,
between
you
and
the
other
side?
we
took
this
case
to
decide
whether
the
balancing
was
properly
done
in
this
case.
i
thought
that
we
were
going
to
talk
about
whether
the
balancing
was
necessary.
