justice
blackmun
i
suppose,
let
me
change
justice
brennan's
hypothetical
a
little.
suppose
that
the
name
of
the
witness
was
on
the
list
that
counsel
had
prepared
but
that
his
secretary
just
omitted
one
name
out
of
twenty,
you
would
come
to
the
same
conclusion,
i
take
it?
justice
blackmun
the
hypothetical
that
i
gave
you
was
that
it
was
a
sheer
secretary's
oversight.
justice
blackmun
do
you
have
in
illinois
a
notice
of
alibi
rule?
justice
blackmun
and
you
would
take
the
same
position
with
respect
to
that
that
you
are
taking
here?
