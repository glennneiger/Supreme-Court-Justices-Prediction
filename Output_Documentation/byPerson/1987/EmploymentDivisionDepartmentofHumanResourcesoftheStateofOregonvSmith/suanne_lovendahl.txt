ms.
suanne
lovendahl
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
essentially,
the
attorney
general
is
arguing
that
it
disagrees
with
the
decision
of
state
law
on
a
state
law
issue,
which
has
been
our
position
essentially
all
along.
if
you
remove
the
alleged
criminality
of
the
respondent's
conduct,
these
cases
are
no
different
from
the
situations
presented
by
the
patterns
in
sherbert,
thomas
and
hobbie.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
well,
in
my
brief
in
opposition,
i
said
that
the
state
law
correctly
applied
to
principles
in
the
context
of
the
state...
the
state
court
applied
them
in
the
context
of
the
state
law.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
well,--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--i
was
responding
to
the
way
that
they
had
done
their
issues,
but
within
that
response
was
the
assumption
that
that
was
a
state
law
issue.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
the
decision,
though,
that
the
interest
had
to
be
found
on
the
state
unemployment
compensation
statutes
was
a
decision,
they
were
interpreting
the
state
law.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
correct.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
it
rests
on
a
federal
ground
in
that
it
was
controlled
by
sherbert
and
thomas.
hobbie
had
not
been
decided.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
no.
i
mean
that
there's
not
a
federal
distinction
between
this
case
and
sherbert,
thomas
and
hobbie.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
rather
than
it
was
not
decided--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--exactly.
those
cases
are
controlling.
if
you
accept
the
attorney
general
office's
argument
here,
the
effect
ultimately
is
to
present,
actually
present
establishment
law
problem.
they
say
that
there
is
an
establishment
law
problem
and
i
say
that
if
these
cases
are
reversed,
you're
presenting
an
establishment
law
problem
because
no
other
person
who
was
in
this
situation
would
have
been
denied
benefits
on
the
grounds
of
illegality.
so,
they
are
really
trying
to
get
the
court
to
consider
illegality
in
the
context
that
no
other
person
would
be
penalized
on
that
specific
basis.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
right.
there
is
a
work
connection
here,
but
it
was
the
same
situation
as
sherbert,
thomas
and
hobbie.
there
was
a
work
connection
in
all
of
those
cases.
the
test
isn't
whether
the
person's
getting
a
special
benefit
because
of
their
religion,
but
are
they
being
differently
than
other
people
who
are
forced...
they
are
being
forced
to
choose
between
their
religion
and
their
job.
are
they
being
treated
differently
from
other
individuals
in
the
state
who
are
involuntarily
unemployed
and
eligible
for
that
benefit
program.
in
sherbert
and
thomas
and
hobbie,
the
people
were
refusing
to
do
work
and
nobody
else
who
had
been
in
that
situation,
nobody
who
refused
to
do
their
job
all
together
would
have
gotten
benefits.
nobody
who
refused
to
work
on
sunday
would
have
gotten
benefits,
but
other
religions
were
not
put
to
that
choice.
in
this
case,
though,
if
you
do
compare
fact
for
fact,
in
fact,
it
is
not
true,
as
the
attorney
general's
office
represents,
that
all
job-related
drug
use
is
disqualified.
i
cited
two
cases
in
my
brief
that
are
acknowledgement
of
the
recognition
that
alcoholism
and
drug
use
are
considered...
this
was
an
employer
who
was
a
rehabilitation
employer
and
it
was
their
philosophy
that
any
use
of
drugs
or
alcohol
by
a
recovering
person
was
an
illness.
so,
in
this
situation,
if
the
people
were
drug
and
alcohol
counselors,
if
they
used
drugs
off
duty
and
it
was
a
product
of
a
drug
addiction
or
if
they
used
wine
in
a
church
ceremony,
that
would
be
considered
relapse,
and
as
long
as
the
individuals
were
able
to
work
and
do
other
jobs,
they
would,
in
fact,
be
eligible
for
benefits.
so,
these
people
would
really
be
disadvantaged
by
applying
a
test
requested
by
the
attorney
general's
office
rather
than
the
reverse
in
this
case.
the
most
disturbing
suggestion
that
the
state
makes
in
this
case
is
that
they
can
extinguish
a
free
exercise
guarantee
simply
by
labeling
conduct
as
criminal.
i
think
it's
been
obvious
for
quite
some
time
that
the
established
test
is
that
under
the
constitution
you
have
a
right--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--well,
i
think
that
that
balancing
test
has
to
be
applied.
you
can't
ignore
the
balancing
test.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
well,
our
position
is
that
if
you
xx
to
look
at
the
statute
at
issue
that's
imposing
the
burden.
in
the
unemployment
context
scheme,
there
was...
the
legality
of
the
contact
was
really
irrelevant.
so,
it
wasn't
xx
that
was
decided
before.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
right.
it's
a
very
circular
type
of
situation
that
we're
in
and
that
is
presented
by
the
state
in
this
case,
but
the
fact
is
that
under
the
constitution,
you
have
a
free
exercise
right
and
it
can
only
be
overcome
if
the
state
can
show
a
compelling
interest.
now,
in
each
individual
fact
situation,
the
fact
is
that
under
the
unemployment
statutes,
this
person
is
put
to
the
same
choice
as
the
person
who
is
under
their
religion.
they
have
to
choose
between
the
job
requirement
and
adhering
to
their
faith.
in
a
criminal
situation,--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--yes,
and
in--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--no,
i
don't
think
we
do,
because
i
feel
that
that's
the
problem
with
their
argument,
is
that
they
can't
boot
strap
another
statute.
the
fact
is
that
he
has
a
free
exercise
right--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--well,
there
would
be
if
that
issue
could
be
decided,
but
under
the
state
unemployment
statute,
the
interest
to
be
served
by
that
statute
is
to
protect
involuntarily
unemployed
workers,
and
i
think
the
question
in
this
case
really
is
would
that
interest
be
thwarted
by
giving
unemployment
benefits--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--well,
the
fact
is
that
other
people
who
want
to
argue
this--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--well,
it's
our
position
that
this
particular
religious
practice
is
protected,
and
we've
argued
that
in
our
brief.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
well,
not
to
use
drugs,
but
in
terms
of
whether
the
conduct
is
criminal
or
not,
in
wisconsin
v.
yoder,
the
court
made
clear
that
you
still
have
to
go
through
the
entire
balancing
test.
obviously,
where
conduct
is
made
criminal,
the
most
extreme
burden
that
you
could
have
and
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
show--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--right.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
well,
because
that
wasn't
the
issue
before
them
and
that
was
why
they
didn't
address
it.
that
was
one
of
the
things
that--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--well,
our
position
is
that
there
would
be
no
distinction
between
this
case
at
all,
if
the
conduct...
if
it
was
clear
that
this
conduct
was
constitutionally
protected.
that's
an
issue
that's
never
clearly
been
decided
and
since,
in
this
case,
the
unemployment
compensation
statutes
are
the
statute
being
applied,--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--well,
we
don't
really
feel
that
that's
an
issue
that
has
to
be
decided
in
this
case.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
no.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
job-related
drug
use?
that's
correct.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
well,
let
me
correct
myself
to
your
last
question,
though.
job-related
drug
use
would
be
protected
if
it
was
a
product
of
an
illness.
in
other
words,
not
willful,
which
i
think
is
the
same
situation
when
you're
talking
about
a
religious
impulse,
and,
so,
that's
why
we
feel
that
they're
in
the
same
position
in
sherbert,
thomas
and
hobbie.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
it
was
in
response
to
a
dictate
of
their
religion.
i
think
that
that's
the
idea
behind
sherbert,
thomas
and
hobbie,
is
that
you're
responding
to
an
authority
higher
than
your
employer,
but
not--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--that's
correct,
and
that's
the
question
in
this
case,
is
does
that
have
an
effect
or
not,
and
our
position
is
that
you
look
to
the
state
law
and
if,
under
the
state
law,
that's
not
an
interest
to
be
served
by
that
particular
legislation,
then
it
has
no
bearing.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
yeah.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
well,
what
they
did
was
they
were
deciding
how
to
consider
the
legality
and
decided
that
it
was
irrelevant
and
then
went
on
and
did
their
balancing,
but
under
state
law,
it
wasn't
anything
that
could
be
considered
because
the
legality
wasn't
relevant,
and--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--my
reading
of
that
portion
of
the
opinion
was
that
they
looked
to
the
legality
before
they
did
the
balancing
test
to
see
whether
it
should
be
considered
or
not.
i
think
that
they
rejected
the
attorney
general's
argument
because
the
purpose
of
the
unemployment
statute
was
not
to
enforce
the
state
criminal
code.
admittedly,
that's
a
statute
that
imposes
a
burden,
but
the
unemployment
compensation,
the
burden
imposed
by
that
statute,
was
what
the
court
was
trying
to
determine.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
the
state
law
portion
of
it
was
that
they
interpreted
their
constitution
more
restrictively
than
the
federal
constitution
has
determined.
under
the
way
that
they
interpreted
the
oregon
constitution,
sherbert,
thomas
and
hobbie
would
not
have
gotten
benefits.
there
has
been
one
case
applying
these
cases
since
then
involving
a
jehovah's
witness
and
they
reached
the
same
result,
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
benefits
under
the
state
constitution,
but
they
were
entitled
to
them
under
the
federal
constitution.
so,
that's
not
the
state
law
decision
that
we're
interested
in.
we're
concerned
about
how
you
consider
criminality
under
the
unemployment
statute.
it
was
a
separate
determination
that
they
had
made.
in
wisconsin
v.
yoder,
the
court
stated
that
only
those
interests
of
the
highest
order
and
those
not
otherwise
served
can
over-balance
claims
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion,
and
in
this
case,
the
state
has
a
set
of
statutes
designed
to
serve
its
interests
in
law
enforcement
and
the
state
legislature
made
it
clear
that
the
unemployment
compensation
statute
is
not
to
serve
that
purpose.
there
might
be
some
instances
where
that's
not
the
case,
but
accepting
their
theory
in
this
situation,
the
fact
is
that
the
individuals
would
not...
would
be
discriminated
against
rather
than
favored.
the
division
does
pay
benefits
to
people
who
engage
in
criminal
law,
and
the
only
difference
here
is
that
the
people
are
work-connected.
they're
claiming
that
they're
getting
a
special
protection
under
the
free
exercise
clause
that
they
wouldn't
have
gotten
but
for
their
religion,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
reason
we
have
a
free
exercise
law
is
to
balance
the
rights
that
the
majority
has
through
legislation.
if
this
was
a
majority
religion
in
this
country,
this
practice
would
never
be
illegal,
and
that's
where
that
balance
comes
in,
and
why
it's
important
to
protect
this
type
of
conduct.
we
do
feel,
though,
that
if
the
state
is
obligated
somehow
under
the
federal
constitution
to
consider
the
status
of
the
criminal
statutes,
that,
first,
it
is
extremely
unclear
that
mr.
smith
and
mr.
black
could
have
been
charged
with
any
crime.
they
admitted
that
they
used
peyote
in
the
ceremony.
use
itself
is
not
illegal.
they
never
admitted
that
they
possessed
it
or
exercised
dominion
and
control
over
it.
from
the
native
american
church
amicus
brief,
it
is
clear
that
it's
the
road
man
who
exercises
dominion
and
control
and
that
the
people
who
attend
the
ceremony
have
no
more
control
than
an
individual
who's
at
a
christian
ceremony
when
wine
is
used.
it
is
essentially
the
same
situation.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
well,
in
wisconsin
v.
yoder,
this
court
found
that
the
interest
should
be
weighed
where
the
state's
interest
in
enforcing
that
law
against
this
particular
religious
group.
otherwise,
the
state's
interest
would
always
outweigh
the
interest
of
the
division.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
right.
that
would
make
it
a
different
case
if
the
court
could
find
that,
and
that
is
our
position,
that
they
didn't
engage
in
criminal
conduct
and
they
couldn't
be
charged.
the
attorney
general's
office
disputes
that.
that
was
never
an
issue
that
was
ruled
on
by
the
court.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
right.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
right.
but
if
these
people
are
exercising
their
free
religious
exercise
right,
it's
not
illegal
under
federal
law,
their
particular
conduct,
i
don't
see
how
the
state
can
consistently
with
the
constitution
impose
a
penalty
against
them
on
the
basis
of
their
activity
as,
in
fact,
illegal.
it's
not...
it's
sort
of
a
false
issue,
you
know,
i
agree,
but
in
terms
of
whether
the
church
practice
itself
is
exempted,
the
federal
government
and
every
state
that
has
considered
this
particular
issue
has
found
this
to
be
a
safe
practice.
in
the
attorney
general's
reply
brief,
they
conceded
that
this
particular
church
has
a
long
history
of
safe
use.
the
lack
of
enforcement
of
the
statutes
against
native
america
church
members--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--right.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
right.
the
problem,
of
course,
is
that
it's
not
a
decision
that
the
court
could
determine...
could
really
consider
under
its
opinion
of
the
law
in
the
context
of
an
unemployment
proceeding
since
it
decided
that
it
was
irrelevant,
and
i
do
feel
that
that
was
the
state
court's
decision.
the
attorney
general's
office
did
present
the
argument
that
it
was...
there
was
no
protected
constitutional
right
and
they
did
reject
it.
in
the
course
of
rejecting
it,
they...
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
referred
to
the
ambiguity
about
whether
there
was,
in
fact,
some
constitutional
protection
and
suggested
that
their
state
decision
in
soto
v.
state
would
be
overruled
if
it
came
before
them
again.
they
noted
that
it
appeared
to
be
a
relic
of
a
prior
time.
it
was
based
on
a
statute
that
was
repealed
as
well.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
the
native
american
church
practice
conduct?
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
well,
in
the
soto
case,
i
believe
that
was
disposed
of
under
the
federal
constitution.
what
they
basically
decided
was
that
it
was
a
positive
legislative
enactment
and
didn't
go
into
any
kind
of
balancing
test
at
all.
an
individual
who
is--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--that
the
individual
could
not
even
raise
the
defense.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
the
individual
who
was
charged
with
the
possession
could
not
even
raise
the
religious
freedom
defense.
so,
in
the
dissent,
they--
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
--right.
that
there
was
no
protection
whatsoever.
well,
the
person
couldn't
even
raise
the
defense.
they
didn't
get
to
the
balancing
test.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
they
just
considered
that
the
fact
that
it
was
made
criminal
under
state
law
was
sufficient
to
over-ride
the
individual's
claim.
ms.
suanne
lovendahl
yeah,
and
there
was
a
strongly
worded
dissent
in
that
case,
essentially
to
the
effect
that
the
court
was
abdicating
its
responsibility
as
final
arbiter
of
constitutional
rights.
in
any
event,
in
terms
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
practice,
the
state
has
a
history
of
lack
of
enforcement,
so,
it
doesn't
appear
that
they
have
an
overwhelming
interest
in
over-riding
or
disposing
of
this
particular
church
practice,
and
the
only
concern
that
they
have
is
that
flood
gates
will
essentially
be
opened.
this
isn't
a
situation,
though,
where
many
other
churches
meet
the
test
of
safety
that
the
history
of
the
native
american
church
has
demonstrated.
this
is
an
ancient
religion
that's
been
going
on
before
the
practice
was
made
criminal.
the
classic
kind
of
situation
that
was
presented
in
wisconsin
v.
yoder,
with
the
amish.
their
practices
were
not
illegal
before
enactment
of
the
state
criminal
code.
in
fact,
this
church
practice
serves
the
purpose
that
the
criminal
law
statutes
were
intended
to
serve.
it's
actually
a
treatment
program
for
individuals
who
have
had
difficulty
with
problems
of
alcoholism
and
a
number
of
alcohol
rehabilitation
treatment
centers
use
peyote
in
native
american
church
ceremonies
as
a
way
of
helping
native
americans.
it's
an
extremely
important
cultural-specific
treatment
plan
that
would
actually
compromise
the
interest
of
the
state
in
helping
people
overcome,
particularly
native
americans
to
overcome,
the
problems
of
drug
addiction
and
substance
abuse.
the
reasons
that
the
state
has
given
are
purely
speculative
and,
in
essence,
they
have
admitted
that
they
do
not
have
a
strong
interest
in
terminating
this
particular
religious
practice.
there
have
been
a
number
of
state
court
xx
that
have
had
the
benefit
of
the
full
evidentiary
record
on
this
particular
issue,
and
they
have
made
it
clear
that
this
is
something
that
should
be
constitutionally
protected.
the
effect
of
a
decision
finding
the
criminality
of
these
individuals'
conduct
to
distinguish
this
case
from
sherbert,
thomas
and
hobbie
by
implication
suggests
that
there
is
no
constitutional
protection
here,
and
i
submit
that
that
would
indicate
a
discrimination
against
this
religious
practice
that
would
effectively
cast
a
shadow
over
this
entire
church.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
these
people,
this
situation
presented
here
is
different
from
a
situation
in
sherbert,
thomas
and
hobbie,
and
i
feel
that
the
same
results
should
obtain.
thank
you.
