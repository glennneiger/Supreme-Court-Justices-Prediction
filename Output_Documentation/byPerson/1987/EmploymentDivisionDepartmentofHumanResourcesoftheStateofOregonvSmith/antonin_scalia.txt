justice
scalia
what
is...
say
it
again.
you've
lost
me.
justice
scalia
so,
you
think
that
sentence,
which
reads
"the
state's
interest
in
denying
unemployment
benefits
to
a
claimant
discharged
for
religiously-motivated
misconduct
must
be
found
in
the
unemployment
compensation
statutes,
not
in
the
criminal
statutes.
"
describing
the
use
of
peyote,
you
think
that
sentence
is
meant
to
be
a
statement
of
federal
law
rather
than
a
statement
of
state
law?
justice
scalia
what
they're
saying
is
that
under
sherbert,
you
have
to
find
it
within
the
state's--
justice
scalia
--unless
it's
unconstitutional
to
render
it
criminal.
justice
scalia
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
hospitals
that
have
cocaine,
i
suppose.
right?
i
mean,--
justice
scalia
--well,
pick
some
other
narcotic
that
is
generally
illegal
for
traffic
but
is
allowed
to
be
used
for
some
purposes.
justice
scalia
laudanum
or
whatever
you
want.
justice
scalia
well,
the
purpose
alleged
here
is
a
religious
one.
justice
scalia
specifically,
you
think
they
read
sherbert
xx
requiring
that
whatever
state
interest
exists
in
order
to
overcome
the
claim
for
an
exemption
or
an
unwritten
exemption,
whatever
state
interest
exists
must
be
reflected
in
the
compensation
statutes
themselves?
justice
scalia
rather
than
just
in
some
criminal
law?
justice
scalia
ms.
lovendahl,
you
say
that's
been
your
position
all
along.
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
doesn't
mention
at
all
that
this
case
was
decided
on
the
ground
of
state
law,
and
i
would
have
thought
that
if
that
language
is
to
be
read
the
way
you
assert,
now
assert
it
is
to
be
read,
you
would
have
said
that.
justice
scalia
you
had
two
points.
reason
for
denying
the
writ:
(1)
the
federal
question
raised
by
petitioner
has
been
clearly
settled,
(2)
the
decision
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
is
consistent
with
applicable
decisions
of
this
court.
one
would
have
expected
(3)
this
case
presents
nothing
but
a
question
of
state
law.
justice
scalia
it's
just
not
there.
justice
scalia
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
the
reason
they
did
their
issues
that
way
is
that
the
sentence
you're
relying
upon,
to
wit
the
state's
interest
in
denying
employment
benefits
must
be
found
in
the
unemployment
compensation
statutes,
that
is
two
sentences
away
from
the
lead
sentence
of
the
paragraph,
which
reads:
"nor
is
the
state's
interest
in
this
case
any
more
over-riding
or
compelling
interest
than
in
sherbert
and
thomas.
"
and
i
read
that...
the
later
sentence
as
the
state
did
here,
to
be
referring
to
what
is
necessary
for
the
state's
interest
to
be
considered
over-riding
under
sherbert
and
thomas,
and
the
court
is
saying
in
order
to
be
so,
it
has
to
be
found
in
the
unemployment
compensation
statutes,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
whole
case
has
been
argued
all
the
way
through
right
up
to
here
on
that
assumption,
and
all
of
a
sudden,
in
your
reply
brief,
we
find
that
this
case
has
just
been
decided
under
state
law.
had
we
known
that,
we
wouldn't
have
granted
cert
in
the
case.
justice
scalia
is
that
a
question
of
federal
law
or
state
law
whether
you
look
to
the
state
law?
i
guess
you're
coming
back
to
that
sentence,
and
i
hate
to
be
dense,
but
i
still
don't
understand
what
you're
asserting
that
the
sentence
means.
i
think
you're
saying
that
the
court
was
saying
that
the
state's
interest...
that
for
purposes
of
sherbert
and
thomas,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
state's
interest
apart
from
the
interest
found
in
the
unemployment
compensation
statute
is
irrelevant.
right?
for
purposes
of
sherbert
and
thomas,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
any
interest
not
in
the
unemployment
compensation
statute
is
irrelevant.
is
that
a
question
of
state
law?
justice
scalia
can
you
say
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
it's
irrelevant
for
sherbert
and
thomas
or
is
that
a
question
of
federal
law?
justice
scalia
what
do
you
mean
under
state
law?
but
he's
not
discussing
state
law.
he's
discussing
sherbert
and
thomas.
justice
scalia
determine
the
state
law
issue
and
it
was
conceded
that
it
was
a
violation
under
state
law.
what
was
contended
for
was
a
requisite
exception
under
federal
law,
under
sherbert
and
thomas.
justice
scalia
well,
is
it
necessary
for
the
state's
case
in
order
to
refute
the
necessity...
the
constitutional
necessity
for
an
exception
to
their
unemployment
scheme,
is
it
necessary
for
them
to
show
that
this
particular
conduct
would
have
been
unconstitutional
or
isn't
it
enough
to
show
that
there
is
a
general
state
policy
against
the
use
of
drugs?
i
mean,
the
policy
against
the
possession
of
it
is
obviously
directed
to
prevent
the
use
of
it,
and
wouldn't
it
be
enough
just
to
show
a
general
policy
whether
the
state
showed
that
this
particular
individual
was
criminally
in
violation
or
not?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
quarreling
about
the
weighing
argument.
i'm
quarreling
about
your
assertion
that
there's
nothing
to
weigh
because
this
individual
had
not
violated
the
criminal
law.
you're
trying
to
preclude
the
weighing.
justice
scalia
i'm
saying
i
don't
see
how
that's
relevant.
it
clearly
is
a
state
policy,
expressed
in
its
criminal
laws,
against
the
use
of
peyote.
justice
scalia
against
the
possession.
the
criminal
law
addresses
possession,
but
the
objective
of
it
is
to
prevent
the
use,
isn't
that
so?
