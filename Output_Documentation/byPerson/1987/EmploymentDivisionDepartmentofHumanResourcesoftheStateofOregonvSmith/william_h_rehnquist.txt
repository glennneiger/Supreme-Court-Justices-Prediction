mr.
gary,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
gary,
there
seems
to
be
some
dispute
between
you
and
your
opponents
as
to
whether
this
particular
conduct
was
criminal
under
the
laws
of
oregon.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
do
you
read
the
oregon
supreme
court's
opinion
as
resting
perhaps
by
implication
on
the
proposition
that
the
religious
use
of
peyote
cannot
be
punished
or
burdened
by
the
state
because
of
the
federal
free
exercise
clause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
rested
its
decision
on
the
federal
free
exercise
clause,
but
not
on
the
ground
that
you
could
not
criminalize
peyote?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gary.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
lovendahl.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
and,
so,
why
do
you
say
then
that
this
policy
or
whatever
was
not
found
in
the
unemployment
compensation
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
they
didn't
smoke
the
stuff
or
whatever
you
do
with
it
voluntarily?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
in
sherbert
and
thomas,
there
was
no
question
but
what
the
conduct
engaged
in
was
perfectly
lawful.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
lovendahl.
mr.
gary,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gary.
the
case
is
submitted,--
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
nos.
86-946,
86-947,
employment
division
department
of
human
resources
of
oregon
versus
smith
and
another
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
