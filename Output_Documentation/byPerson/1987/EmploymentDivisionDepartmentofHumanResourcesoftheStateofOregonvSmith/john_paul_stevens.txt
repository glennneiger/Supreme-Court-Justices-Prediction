justice
stevens
then,
it
seems
to
me
you're
suggesting
that
really
the
critical
issue
in
the
case
that
has
to
be
decided
is
whether
the
conduct
of
using
peyote
in
a
native
american
religious
ceremony
is
constitutionally
protected
or
not.
i
think
it's
critical
to
your
case
that
there
is
no
constitutional
protection
for
this
use
of
peyote.
justice
stevens
you
say
if
there
really
is
no
free
exercise
right
out
there,
then
we
don't
even
reach
the
problems
of
sherbert
and
those
cases,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
why
that's
a
second
reason.
isn't
the
regulatory
interest
the
same
as
the
interest
in
enforcing
the
criminal
law?
justice
stevens
if
you
had
a
statutory
exemption
from
the
prohibition
on
drug
use
for
this
particular...
for
religious
use
of
peyote,
then
it
seems
to
me
one
could
argue
that
the
conduct
was
constitutionally
protected
and
the
regulatory
interest
would
fall
by
the
way
side.
if
there
were
an
exemption
from
the
state
criminal
law.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
right
there
on
that
question,
of
course,
it's
more
than
labelling
it,
i
suppose
they
do
have
a
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
use
certain
drugs.
is
it
your
position
that
it's
constitutionally
impermissible
to
prohibit
the
religious
use
of
peyote?
justice
stevens
but
if
you
apply
the
balancing
test,
do
you
end
up
with...
in
order
to
prevail,
is
it
not
correct
that
you
must
submit
that
your
clients
had
a
constitutional
right
to
make...
to
use
peyote
in
their
religious
ceremonies,
that
the
state
could
not
interfere
with
that
right?
justice
stevens
well,
it's
relevant
if
you
say
that
the
state
may
enforce
a
neutral
law
that
prohibits
all
drug
use
xx
that
that
is
religiously
motivated.
then,
the
law
is
relevant
to
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
you
have...
your
clients
had
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
this
conduct.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
difference
that
i
don't
think
you're
really
confronting
is
the
fact
that
there's
really
no
dispute
that
in
the
sherbert
and
hobbie
and
thomas
cases,
the
conduct
that
was...
that
caused
the
discharge
was
conduct
that
they
had
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in.
there's
an
issue,
however,
in
this
case
as
to
whether
your
clients
had
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
the
conduct
that
led
to
their
discharge.
justice
stevens
and
don't
you
have
to
convince
us
that
they
did
have
a
constitutional
right
in
order
to
prevail?
justice
stevens
if
you
don't
have
such
a
federally
protected
right,
i
don't
see
that
there's
even
a
federal
question
in
the
case.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question?
has
the
oregon
supreme
court
ever
addressed
the
question
of
whether
this
conduct
is
protected
under
the
oregon
constitution?
justice
stevens
yes.
the
use
of
peyote
in
their
religious
ceremony.
has
that
ever
come
up,
do
you
know?
justice
stevens
you
have
to
help
me
a
little
more.
the
soto
case
held
what?
justice
stevens
the
what?
justice
stevens
they
implicitly
held
that
it
was
not
constitutionally
protected.
justice
stevens
but
the
reason
they
couldn't...
was
it
a
procedural
reason
or
because
there's
no
constitutional
protection
for
the
use
of
peyote?
justice
stevens
as
regard
to
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
two
cases
raised
constitutional
question
that
we
have
decided
not
to
decide
without
further
guidance
from
the
oregon
supreme
court.
they
come
to
us
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
that
court
granting
unemployment
compensation
benefits
to
the
two
respondents.
they
are
members
of
the
native
american
church
,that
church
occasionally
holds
ceremonies
that
which
peyote,
a
hallucinogenic
drug
of
the
mescaline
family
is
ingested
as
a
sacrament.
respondents
were
discharged
from
their
jobs
as
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
counselors
after
they
ingested
a
small
amount
of
peyote
during
such
a
religious
ceremony.
petitioner
ruled
that
respondents
were
inillegible
for
unemployment
compensation,
but
the
oregon
supreme
court
disagreed,
holding
that
under
the
precedents
of
this
court
the
denial
of
benefits
violated
respondents'
first
amendment
rights
since
they
have
been
discharged
for
engaging
in
religiously
motivated
conduct.
in
so
holding
the
state
court
attached
no
significance
to
whether
respondents'
act
violated
oregon
law.
even
though
the
precedents
it
relied
on
involved
only
clearly
lawful
religious
conduct.
we
find
that
whether
respondents'
conduct
was
lawful
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
analysis,
since
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
the
right
to
engage
in
unlawful
conduct
even
it
is
religiously
motivated.
because
the
record
before
us
does
not
clearly
reveal
whether
respondents'
conduct
was
prohibited
under
oregon
law,
we
remand
these
cases
to
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
order
that
that
court
may
analyze
the
constitutional
questions
raised
in
light
of
its
determination
of
whether
respondents'
conduct
was
in
violation
of
state
law.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
and
justice
blackmun
have
joined.
justice
kennedy
did
not
participate
in
the
consideration
of
decision
of
the
case.
