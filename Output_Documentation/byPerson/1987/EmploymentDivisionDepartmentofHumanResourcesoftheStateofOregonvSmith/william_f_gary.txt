mr.
william
f.
gary
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondents
in
these
cases
were
employed
as
drug
counselors.
they
were
fired
from
their
jobs
because
they
deliberately
violated
their
employer's
rule
that
counselors
must
refrain
from
all
use
of
dangerous
drugs.
they
applied
for
unemployment
benefits
from
the
petitioner
state
of
oregon.
the
state's
employment
agency
disqualified
them
because
their
drug
use
was
misconduct
connected
with
their
work.
the
question
presented
is
straightforward.
do
claimants
have
a
constitutional
right
under
the
free
exercise
clause
to
compel
the
state
to
pay
them
unemployment
benefits
solely
because
the
criminal
conduct
that
led
to
their
firing,
the
use
of
peyote,
was
religiously
motivated.
mr.
william
f.
gary
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
conduct
is
criminal
under
oregon.
that's
an
issue
that
was
presented
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
relying
on
one
court
of
appeals
decision,
state
v.
downes,
which
was
factually
quite
dissimilar
from
this
case.
it
involved
a
heroin
addict
who
was
injected
with
heroin
and
never
had
any
possession
of
the
drug.
the
oregon
law
is
very
clear
that
possession
means
merely
exerting
control
and,
of
course,
the
reason
for
the
prohibition
against
possession
of
dangerous
drugs
is
precisely
to
deter
the
use
of
the
drug
itself.
mr.
william
f.
gary
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
gary
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
practice,
it
would
be
difficult
to
have
it
administered
without
possessing,
but,
in
any
event,
under
oregon
law,
the
mere
presence
of
an
individual
in
the
ceremony
where
the
peyote
is
there
would
probably
constitute
sufficient
possession
of
the
drug
to
be
criminal
under
oregon
law.
mr.
smith,
one
of
the
claimants
in
this
case,
in
fact,
has
made
the
argument
that
he
needs
to
be
exempted
from
the
oregon
law
because
of
his
religious
beliefs,
because
the
conduct
that
he
engaged
in
in
this
case
and
generally--
mr.
william
f.
gary
--no,
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
correctly
concluded
that
that
was
not
the
basis
for
disqualification
of
these
claimants
under
state
law.
the
basis
for
disqualification
of
these
claimants
under
state
law
was
that
they
violated
a
policy
of
the
employer--
mr.
william
f.
gary
--yes,
and--
mr.
william
f.
gary
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
gary
your
honor,--
mr.
william
f.
gary
--no.
the
supreme
court's
conclusion
was
that
it
was
bound
by
this
court's
decision
in
sherbert
v.
verner
to
consider
only
the
state's
interest
in
the
fiscal
integrity
of
the
fund.
that
is
not
entirely
clear
from
the
opinion,
but
it
is
borne
out
by
the--
mr.
william
f.
gary
--no.
the
argument
that
was
advanced
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
supreme
court
revolved
around
the
question
of
whether
sherbert
v.
verner
would
permit
the
court
to
look
beyond
the
unemployment
scheme
itself
at
other
interests.
oregon's
interest
in
controlling
the
use
of...
the
conduct
that
is
at
issue
here
is
manifested
in
a
variety
of
different
schemes,
not
only
in
the
criminal
law,
but
in
education
programs,
rehabilitation
programs,
and
also
in
the
unemployment
scheme
itself.
in
this
case,
the
disqualification
for
job-related
drug
use
was
entirely
consistent
with
the
employment
division's
policy
of
disqualifying
anyone
who
is
found
to
engage
in
job-related
drug
use.
there
is
a
policy
that
is
included
as
an
appendix
to
the
respondent's
brief
that
was
promulgated
after
this
case
was
decided
but
is
consistent
with
the
practice
that
was
in
effect
at
this
time,
that
demonstrates
that
any
use
of
dangerous
drugs
in
the
job
market,
anything
that
is
job-related,
will
be
grounds
for
disqualification,
and,
so,
i
think
it's
clear
by
an
examination
of
the
briefs
and
taking
the
court's
conclusion
with
respect
to
what
interest
it
examines
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
presented,
that
they
were
including
that
this
court
had
found
them
by
sherbert
to
look
only
at
the
fiscal
interest.
mr.
william
f.
gary
no.
i
concede
that
it
is
not
entirely
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
opinion,
but
i
think
that
when
you
read
the
opinion
in
light
of
the
arguments
that
were
presented
to
the
court,
it
is
clear.
it's
also--
mr.
william
f.
gary
--the
oregon
court
concluded
that
it
was
bound
by
this
court's
decision
in
sherbert
to
look
only
at
the
fiscal
integrity
of
the
fund
as
the
state's
interest,
that
it
was
prohibited
to
look
at
other
compelling
health
and
safety
interests.
mr.
william
f.
gary
yes.
mr.
william
f.
gary
yes.
the
supreme
court's
opinion
in
this
case
is
merely
a
wooden
application
of
the
sherbert
rule,
and
they
make
a
wrong
step
because
they
missed
the
threshold
inquiry
in
sherbert.
sherbert
proceeds
from
the
assumption
that
the
state
has
no
interest
in
regulating
the
underlying
conduct.
because
the
state
has
no
interest
in
regulating
the
underlying
conduct
in
sherbert,
the
state
had
no
interest
in
regulating
mrs.
sherbert's
sunday
worship,
then
the
only
interest
that
the
court...
the
state
could
assert
was
an
interest
other
than
interest
in
regulating
that
conduct.
sherbert
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
state
cannot
burden
a
protected
religious
practice
indirectly
when
it
cannot
burden
it
directly.
the
vital
distinction
in
this
case
between
this
case
and
sherbert
and
thomas
and
hobbie
is
that
here
the
state
does
have
a
vital
health
and
safety
interest
in
regulating
the
conduct
that
these
claimants
engaged
in.
it
has
acted
on
that
health
and
safety
interest
by
making
the
conduct
criminal.
if
the
conduct
is
criminal,
the
state
cannot
be
required
to
provide
benefits
to
these
claimants
because
the
claimants
had
no
right
to
engage
in
the
conduct
in
the
first
place.
mr.
william
f.
gary
precisely.
and
it
is
not
unconstitutional
to
render
it
criminal
because
of
the
nature
of
the
state's
health
and
safety
interest.
oregon,
like
all
states,
has
determined
that
there
is
a
compelling
need
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
drug
abuse
and
no
one
in
this
court
disputes
that.
the
compelling
nature
of
the
state's
interest
in
regulating
drug
use
is
conceded
by
the
claimants.
they
also
concede
that
that
compelling
interest
is
furthered
by
the
criminal
prohibition.
peyote
is
a
schedule
1
drug
in
oregon.
it
is...
that
means
that
it
has
determined
that
there
is
no
safe
use
for
it.
it
cannot
be
used
safely
even
under
the
care
of
a
physician
and
that
there
is
a
great
susceptibility
to
drug
abuse.
now,
once
we
have
borne
the
burden
of
demonstrating
our
compelling
interest,
the
responsibility
then
is
to
demonstrate
that
that
compelling
interest
would
be
undermined
by
granting
an
exemption
to
the
criminal
law
in
order
to
accommodate
the
religious
practice
at
issue
here.
in
order
to
accommodate
the
religious
practice
would
undermine
the
state's
compelling
interest
in
at
least
four
different
ways.
first,
peyote
is
dangerous
to
the
user
and
to
those
who
come
in
contact
with
the
user.
that's
the
very
reason
why
the
state
has
criminalized
it
in
the
first
place.
it
is
also
dangerous
to
the
community
which
must
xx
its
presence
within
it.
peyote
produces
an
hallucinogenic
state
similar
to
that
produced
by
lsd.
all
fifty
states
and
the
federal
government
categorize
peyote
has
dangerous.
the
dangers
posed
by
peyote
are
indifferent
to
the
motivations
of
the
user,
and
the
state
is
and
should
be
no
less
concerned
about
the
dangers
posed
to
a
religious
user
than
to
the
dangers
posed
by
the
drug...
by
one
who
uses
it
for
xx
purposes
or
for
personal
enlightenment.
once
peyote
is
made
lawful
for
some
purposes,
as
these
claimants
contend
they
have
a
right
to
require
the
state
to
do,
then
the
problem
of
controlling
drug
trafficking
is
significantly
compounded.
peyote
only
grows
in
the
southwestern
united
states,
primarily
texas
and
in
parts
of
mexico.
it
would
be
difficult
to
distinguish
meaningfully
between
traffic
for
lawful
purposes
and
traffic
for
unlawful
purposes.
the
simple
fact
is
that
once
some
people
have
a
right
to
possess
peyote,
there
is
an
increased
risk
the
drug
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
who
do
not
have
that
right.
there
is
a
risk
that
others
will
commit
crimes
against
persons
who
posses
peyote
lawfully
in
order
to
obtain
it
from
them.
these
claimants,
like
eighty-nine
percent
of
the
native
american
population
in
oregon,
reside
in
urban
areas,
and
that
merely
compounds
the
risk
that
the
presence
of
the
drug
in
the
community
will
mean
that
it
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
persons
who
cannot
possess
it--
the
record
in
this
case
includes
an
affidavit
from
stanley
smart,
who
is
a
road
chief,
who
conducts
the
peyote
ceremony.
he
indicates
that
it
is
not
uncommon
for
him
to
conduct
as
many
as
four
peyote
ceremonies
a
week.
that
means
that
at
any
given
time,
mr.
smart
is
in
the
possession
of
a
large
amount
of
peyote,
and
he
makes
himself
thereby
a
target
for
those
who
would
mean
to
obtain
the
drug
from
him
for
unlawful
uses.
moreover,
to
accommodate
the
religious
drug
use
and
to
treat
all
religious
beliefs--
mr.
william
f.
gary
--in
oregon,
your
honor,
hospitals
would
not
have
cocaine
because
it's
a
schedule
1
drug.
mr.
william
f.
gary
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
gary
that's
correct,
and
that
problem
is
addressed
because
there
is
a
conclusion
that
there
are
some
safe
uses
for
the
drug
and
that
it
serves
a
purpose.
mr.
william
f.
gary
that's
correct.
but
the
religious
use
is
the
same
use
that
the
state
has
concluded
is
dangerous
and
i
think
demonstrably
dangerous
because
of
the
nature
of
the
hallucinogenic
state
that
it
produces,
and
the
record
in
this
case
reflects
that
the
purpose
of
the
religious
practice
is
to
induce
that
hallucinogenic
state.
and,
so,
the
danger
that
everyone
concedes
the
state
has
a
compelling
interest
to
address
is
directly
implicated
by
the
practice
at
issue
here.
mr.
william
f.
gary
no,
your
honor.
i
am
asking
you
to
hold
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
two
things.
first,
that
where
the
state
has
a
regulatory
interest
in
the
conduct
that
underlies
the
disqualification
for
unemployment
benefits,
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
to
consider
that
interest
in
determining
whether
the
disqualification
is
an
impermissible
burden
on
free
exercise.
mr.
william
f.
gary
well,
if
they
refuse
to
do
it
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
then
my
burden
is
much
heavier
to
carry.
my
point
is
that
they
did
not
and
at
a
minimum--
mr.
william
f.
gary
--no.
i
suspect
that
the
record
in
this
case,
when
you
review
it,
will
confirm
my
assertion
that
the
determination
by
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
was
a
determination
that
they
felt
bound
to
make
by
virtue
of
this
court's
prior
decisions.
if
you
reach
that
conclusion,
then,
at
a
minimum,
this
case
must
be
sent
back
to
the
court
for
them
to
consider
the
application
of
our
health
and
safety
interest
in
the
context
of
the
regulatory
scheme
at
issue.
but
you
don't
even
need
to
get
to
that
point
because
our
threshold
point
is
that
the
criminal
law
of
oregon
is
relevant
to
the
determination
in
a
federal
constitutional
sense
that
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
simply
swept
under
the
rug,
and
that
is
our
first
argument,
that
because
the
conduct
is
prohibited
as
a
matter
of
criminal
law,
assuming
that
that
criminal
prohibition
is
constitutional
and
we
contend
that
it
is,
then
these
claimants
had
no
free
exercise
right
to
engage
in
the
conduct
and
sherbert
simply
doesn't
apply
because
sherbert
only
controls
when
the
state
has
no
interest
that
it
has
acted
upon
in
regulating
the
conduct
itself.
when
the
state
has
regulated
the
conduct
itself
and,
as
in
this
case,
has
outright
prohibited
it,
sherbert
doesn't
apply.
you
don't
even
get
past
that
threshold
holding
by
justice
brennan
in
his
opinion
that
you
enter
into
the
analysis
that
requires
the
state
to
prove
a
compelling
state
interest
from
withholding
the
benefits
only
because
the
state
has
no
interest
in
regulating
the
conduct.
mr.
william
f.
gary
yes.
it
is
critical
to
our
case
that
there
is
no
constitutional
protection.
it
is
not
absolutely
necessary
for
the
court
to
decide
that
oregon
can
criminalize
the
conduct
because
we
think
that
the
court
can
and
should
evaluate
the
state's
regulatory
interest
in
the
context
of
the
question
of
whether
benefits
may
be
denied.
mr.
william
f.
gary
that's
precisely
correct.
and
because
of
that--
mr.
william
f.
gary
--no,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
the
supreme
court
even
considered
that
question,
although
it
was
advanced
before
them,
and
the
reason
that
the
court's
opinion
should
not
be
read
to
hold
that
oregon
cannot
punish
the
conduct
criminally
is
because
it
would
require
the
supreme
court
to
overrule
a
prior
court
of
appeals
decision
in
oregon
state
v.
soto,
which
held
precisely
the
opposite.
the
only
law
in
oregon,
judicial
decision
in
oregon,
says
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
an
exemption
from
the
application
of
the
criminal
law
for
religious
use
of
peyote.
mr.
william
f.
gary
that's
correct.
in
essence,
what
the
oregon
supreme
court
did
was
leap-frog
over
that
threshold
inquiry
and
then
enter
into
a
balancing
test
which
was
hopelessly
infected
by
a
misreading
of
this
court's
decision
in
sherbert.
even
then,
they
only
considered
the
regulatory...
i
mean,
the
financial
interests
and
they
did
not
consider
our
regulatory
interests.
mr.
william
f.
gary
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
gary
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
the
way
they
read
sherbert,
and
in
order
for
them
to
read
that,
sherbert,
that
way,
they
mistook
this
court's
conclusion
in
sherbert
reiterated
in
thomas
and
hobbie,
that
the
state
had
no
interest
in
regulating
the
conduct
as
a
holding
that
the
state's
interest
in
regulating
the
conduct
was
irrelevant
to
the
inquiry.
that
was
the
constitutional
mistake
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
made.
now,--
mr.
william
f.
gary
--no,
your
honor.
the
court
specifically
held
that
the
benefits
would
be
denied
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
walk
you
through
the
court's
decision.
mr.
william
f.
gary
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
gary
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
gary
yes.
i
think
you're
right,
and
that's
why
it's
a
little
astonishing
that
the
court
takes
our
concession
in
the
part
of
our
brief
where
we
are
talking
about
the
state
law
issue
of
whether
these
people
are
disqualified
and
then
translates
that
into
our...
the
part
of
our
brief
that
dealt
with
the
impact
of
the
criminal
prohibition
on
the
federal
constitutional
issue,
and
it's
a
little
bit
baffling,
but
it's
very
clear
from
our
briefs
that
have
consistently
argued
that
the
criminal
conduct
was
not
the
basis
for
the
disqualification
under
oregon
law,
but
that
the
fact
that
the
conduct
is
criminal
is
vital
to
the
court's
assessment
of
the
free
exercise
clause.
mr.
william
f.
gary
yes.
what
the
court
did
was
begin
as
the
oregon
court
always
does
by
looking
at
its
own
statutes,
included
that
under
oregon
law,
because
these
claimants
engaged
in
job-related
drug
use,
that
actively
undermined
their
employer's
interests,
which
in
this
case
happens
to
coincide
with
the
state's
interests,
that
constituted
misconduct
in
connection
with
the
work
and
like
anyone
who
engages
in
job-related
drug
use,
these
claimants
are
disqualified
under
state
law.
they
then
turn
to
the
oregon
constitution
and
concluded
that
the
oregon
religion
clauses
did
not
compel
the
state
to
provide
benefits
in
any
event
and
they
turned
specifically
then
to
this
court's
decision
in
sherbert
v.
verner
and
that's
where
they
made
the
wrong
turn.
mr.
william
f.
gary
correct.
mr.
william
f.
gary
yes.
the
interest
that
the
supreme
court
was
applying
is
the
interest
that
the
state
has
in
deterring
job-related
drug
use
and
there
are
a
wide
variety
of
reasons.
mr.
william
f.
gary
that's
correct.
in
oregon,
one
is
disqualified
only
for
job-related
drug
use
and
there's
a
very
good
reason
for
that.
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act
requires
that
in
order
for
states
to
have
qualified
programs,
they
can
only
disqualify
persons
for
job-related
misconduct.
therefore,
it
is
completely
irrelevant
under
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act
and
in
order
for
oregon
to
have
a
qualified
program,
we
cannot
disqualify
persons
for
off-the-job
drug
use.
but
it
is,
nevertheless,
very
clear
that
if
you're
going
to
apply
the
state's
regulatory
interest
in
the
context
of
the
unemployment
scheme,
it
plays
out
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
when
you
look
at
the
state's
regulatory
interest
and
consider
whether
these
claimants
are
entitled
to
an
exemption
from
the
criminal
law.
the
criminal
prohibition
is
just
one
important
application
of
the
state
of
oregon's
public
policy
to
curb
drug
abuse.
as
i
said
earlier,
the
same
policy
is
furthered
and
reflected
in
other
programs
and
is
reflected
in
the
unemployment
compensation
scheme.
for
example,
a
policy
memorandum
dealing
with
employer
drug
testing
that
is
attached
to
the
respondent's
xx
states,
"if
an
employee
is
discharged
for
failing
a
drug
test
and
it
is
demonstrated
that
the
employee's
job
performance
xx
impaired
by
drugs,
it
is
a
discharge
for
misconduct.
"
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act
limits
our
disqualification
only
to
job-related
misconduct,
but
under
oregon
law,
all
job-related
drug
use
is
disqualified.
all
of
the
health
and
safety
concerns
that
drive
our
criminal
prohibition
are
further
served
by
a
disqualification
for
misconduct
connected
with
the
work.
job-related...
and,
really,
the
respondents
in
this
case
can't
contest
that
because
the
very
heart
of
their
claim
is
that
the
disqualification,
burdens,
their
practice
of
drug
case
and
since
our
purpose
is
to
burden
their
practice
of
drug
use,
demonstrates
that
the
unemployment
compensation
scheme
serves
that
purpose,
and
the
same
reasons
that
we
cannot
give
an
exemption
to
their
use
from
the
criminal
law
would
apply
in
analyzing
whether
they
should
be
exempted
from
the
disqualification
from
the
unemployment
law.
in
fact,
when
drug
use
spills
into
the
work
place,
the
hazards
of
that
use
are
even
greater.
in
this
case,
we
were
talking
about
drug
counselors
who,
to
serve
the
interests
of
their
clients
by
acting
as
role
models,
that
suggested
that
perhaps
if
you
use
drugs
responsibly,
you
could
continue
to
use
drugs,
but
it
might
just
as
well
have
been
someone
manufacturing
automobiles
or
flying
airplanes.
drug
use
in
the
work
place
is
a
very
serious
concern.
it's
real,
immediate
and
compelling,
and
the
same
reasons
that
we
can't
grant
the
exemption
would
apply
in
the
context
of
the
unemployment
scheme
itself.
mr.
william
f.
gary
if
the
conduct
was
not
job-related,
they
would
get
unemployment
benefits,
but
the
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
is
because,
as
i
indicated,
federal
unemployment
tax
act
limits
our
inquiry
to
job-related
conduct.
mr.
william
f.
gary
sherbert
v.
verner.
it
would
have
been
under
state
law.
you're
right.
mr.
william
f.
gary
it
would
have
been
as
a
matter
of
state
law
because
the
misconduct
must
be
job-related
in
order
for
anyone
to
be
disqualified.
mr.
william
f.
gary
yes.
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
specifically
so
found.
mr.
william
f.
gary
yes,
but
even
the
rule
that
is
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief
relating
to
disqualification--
mr.
william
f.
gary
--for
two
reasons.
first,
because
if
the
conduct
is
criminal,
the
claimants
have
no
right
to
engage
in
the
conduct
and,
therefore,
they
can't
assert
a
free
exercise
claim.
second,
because
the
state
has
a
regulatory
interest
that
must
be
folded
into
the
calculation,
even
if
you
look
at
whether
these
people
should
have
a
constitutional
exemption
from
the
application
of
the
state
law-based
disqualification.
mr.
william
f.
gary
yes,
your
honor.
it's
the
same
interest.
the
analysis
is
just
slightly
different
depending
on
whether
you
stop
the
analysis
at
the
beginning
or
go
into
the
second--
mr.
william
f.
gary
--if
there
were
an
exemption
from
the
state
criminal
law,
then
i
think
you're
correct.
oregon,
by
the
way,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
i
think,
is
foreclosed
from
granting
that
kind
of
an
exemption
from
its
criminal
law,
unless
it
is
compelled
by
the
free
exercise
clause.
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
william
f.
gary
thank
you.
quickly
to
answer
your
question,
justice
stevens,
the
oregon
supreme
court
held
in
this
case
that
a
denial
of
benefits
did
not
violate
the
oregon
constitution.
they
have
not
specifically
addressed
the
question
that
you
asked
under
the
oregon
constitution,
but
in
oregon,
it
is
very
clear
under
their
other
decisions
that
that
would
violate
what
is
our
equivalent
of
the
establishment
clause
because,
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
justice
scalia,
in
oregon,
a
pinkie
on
the
scale
is
as
bad
as
a
thumb
and
that
would
favor
the
religious
practice,
unless
it
is
required
by
the
free
exercise
clause.
claimants
do
not
get
unemployment
benefits
under
state
law.
that's
settled.
these
claimants
cannot
prevail
unless
you
conclude
that
they
had
a
right
to
engage
in
the
conduct
that
they
engaged
in.
if
the
conduct
is
criminal,
they
had
no
right
to
engage
in
the
conduct.
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
state
must
accommodate
prohibited
conduct.
therefore,
the
criminal
law
issue
must
be
addressed
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
in
order
for
the
claimants
to
prevail,
and
at
a
minimum,
this
case
must
be
sent
back
to
the
oregon
supreme
court
with
instructions
to
do
so.
