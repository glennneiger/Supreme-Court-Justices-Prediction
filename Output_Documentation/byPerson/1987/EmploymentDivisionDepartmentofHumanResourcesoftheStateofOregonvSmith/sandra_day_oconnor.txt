o'connor
well,
but,
the
statute
prohibits
possession,
not
use,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
and
it
is,
i
guess,
theoretically
possible
that
someone
in
a
native
american
church
ceremony
might
have
peyote
buds
administered
to
him
rather
than
possessing
it,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
has
the
oregon
unemployment
compensation
law
dealing
with
commission
of
crimes
been
satisfied
in
this
case,
either
by
the
obtaining
of
a
conviction
of
a
felony
or
by
the
admission
of
it?
justice
o'connor
the
employer's
policy.
justice
o'connor
willful
misconduct
of
an
employer
rule
or
requirement.
justice
o'connor
but
the
oregon
court
went
on
apparently
to
find
that
the
purpose
of
the
oregon
unemployment
compensation
law
did
not
include
a
purpose
to
enforce
oregon's
criminal
law,
didn't
it?
justice
o'connor
it
seems
to
have
determined
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
purpose
is
to
protect
the
fund
and
to
take
care
of
the
unemployment
compensation
policies,
not
the
oregon
criminal
law
policies.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
isn't
because
the
oregon
court
said,
as
i
read
its
opinion,
that
its
purpose,
that
the
purpose
of
the
oregon
law
was
to
protect
the
fund.
justice
o'connor
you
can't
derive
that
from
the
face
and
text
of
the
opinion,
can
you?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
gary,
i'm
still
concerned
because
i'm
not
sure
we
even
get
to
that
question,
unless
we
get
over
the
initial
hurdle
that
i
asked
you
about.
and
if
i
can
return
to
that
a
minute,
are
you
asking
us
to
hold
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
oregon
must
exercise
its
police
powers
through
its
unemployment
compensation
scheme?
justice
o'connor
even
when
the
oregon
court,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
perhaps
has
refused
to
do
it?
justice
o'connor
but
we
don't
know
that
for
sure.
we
don't
know
that.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
they
say
they
would
have
been
denied
benefits
on
the
grounds
of
employee
misconduct.
