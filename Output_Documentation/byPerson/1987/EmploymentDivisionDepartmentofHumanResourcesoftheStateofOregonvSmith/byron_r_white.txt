justice
white
well,
suppose
there
hadn't
been
any
first
amendment
issue
at
all,
did
the
oregon
supreme
court
indicate
that
benefits
should
have
in
any
event
been
granted
in
this
case
because
the
legality
of
the
conduct
was
just
irrelevant?
justice
white
and
that
was
in
the
part
of
the
opinion
that
dealt
with
oregon
law?
justice
white
the
first
part
of
the
opinion?
justice
white
so
that
the
second
part
of
the
opinion
where
the
court
says
that
the
unemployment
benefit,
the
board,
the
division
concedes
that
the
commission
of
an
illegal
act
does
not
in
itself
disqualify,
if
that
were
true,
why,
you
would
think
that
they
wouldn't
have
needed
to
get
to
any
federal
issue.
justice
white
because
they
did
in
the
end
rest
their
judgment
on
the
free
exercise
clause,
did
they
not?
justice
white
well,
they
said
that
aside
from
any
federal
law,
this
claimant
would
have
lost,
should
have
lost
under
state
law.
justice
white
but
only
because...
not
because
the
conduct
was
criminal,
but
because
it
was
wholly
incompatible
with
the
employer's
business.
right?
that's
the
way
you
put
it
a
minute
ago.
justice
white
well,
let
me
put
it
another
way.
suppose
that
in...
when
the
court
was
dealing
with
oregon
law,
it
had
been
found
that
what
the
employee
did
was
not
incompatible
with
her
job
or
his
job,
then
the
claimant
would
not
have
been
disqualified
just
because
the
conduct
was
criminal.
right?
justice
white
well,
suppose
this
employee
had
worked
for
harry
and
david
and
just
used
peyote
in
a
religious
ceremony
and
was
fired
because
of
that
and
the
employee
applied
for
unemployment
compensation,
he
would
have
gotten
that.
justice
white
all
right.
but
if
the
unemployment
board,
nevertheless,
denied
compensation,
it
would
have
been
reversed
in
the
supreme
court?
justice
white
under
state
law.
justice
white
well,
isn't
that
essentially
what
happened
in
the...
here
in
this
case,
when
the
court
was
talking
about
oregon
law?
the
only
reason
that
compensation
was
denied
was
because
the
conduct
was
job-related.
justice
white
and
the
fact
it
was
criminal
had
nothing
we
do
with
it.
justice
white
well,
how
can
you
really
argue
that
although
criminal
conduct
is
not
enough
to
deny
compensation
for,
it,
nevertheless,
can
be
relied
on
to
overcome
a
free
exercise
claim?
justice
white
yes,
but
the...
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
given
that
interpretation
of
state
law,
there's
just
no
really
substantial
federal
question
because
it's
so
clear
that
sherbert
governs
it.
justice
white
but
that's
still
a
federal...
that
still
leaves
the
decision
below
resting
on
the
federal
ground.
justice
white
so,
you
really
don't
say
that
the
case
went
off
on
a
state
ground?
justice
white
yes,
yes.
justice
white
given
that
interpretation
of
the
state
law,
the
federal
issue
is
perfectly
clear.
justice
white
yes,
but
the
court
ruled
that
under
oregon
law,
there
was...
these
benefits
were
properly
denied,
and
the
claim
then
was,
well,
yes,
but
the
first...
the
free
exercise
clause
forbids
you
to
deny
benefits
in
this
case,
even
though
to
every
other
employee
that
engaged
in
misconduct,
benefits
would
be
denied.
so,
you
have
to
get
around,
it
seems
to
me,
to
saying
that
there
is
a
free
exercise
clause
right
to
engage
in
criminal
conduct.
justice
white
well,
let
me
just
ask
you,
do
you
think
there
is
a
free
exercise
clause
right
to
engage
in
criminal
conduct?
justice
white
well,
i
think
you
have
to
convince
us
of
that.
have
you
got
any
cases
like
that,
that
say
that
there's
a
free
exercise
clause
right
to
engage
in...
to
use
drugs?
justice
white
i
read
the
oregon
supreme
court's
opinion
as
reciting
without
any
criticism
the
fact
that
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
religious
use
of
peyote
are
not
exempt
from
criminal
sanctions
in
oregon.
i'm
just
reading
the
footnote.
justice
white
and
they
don't
seem
to
take
any
exception.
the
state
v.
soto.
justice
white
but
is
it
part
of
your
submission
here
that
this
wasn't
criminal
conduct
under
oregon
law
at
all?
i
don't
see...
i
don't
know
whether--
justice
white
--i
understand
that
argument,
but
are
you
asking
us
to
affirm
on
another
ground,
namely
that
this
conduct
wasn't
criminal
under
oregon
law
anyway?
justice
white
all
right.
then,
you
aren't
asking
us.
justice
white
all
right.
the
attorney
general...
the
solicitor
general
says
that
it
was
a
policy
established
by
regulation
of
the
employment
division
that
drug-related...
that
job-related
drug
use
would
be
automatically
disqualified.
you
don't
quarrel
with
that
proposition,
do
you?
justice
white
even
so,
i
take
it
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
essentially
held
that
whether
the
conduct
is
criminal
is
irrelevant
to
determining
the
free
exercise
clause,
and
i
guess
that
that's
your
submission,
too.
justice
white
and
if
we
disagree
with
you,
i
would
think
we
could
disagree
with
the
oregon
supreme
court's
conclusion
that
it
is
irrelevant
and
send
it
back.
they
may
end
up
saying
that,
well,
it's...
so
it's
relevant,
but
in
this
case,
there's
no
criminal
conduct.
