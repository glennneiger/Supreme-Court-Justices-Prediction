mr.
robert
a.
nance
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
issues
presented
in
this
case,
and
i
believe
there
are
three
that
are
not.
the
first
is
whether
the
circumstances
of
the
removal
of
potential
juror
huling
from
the
panel
by
a
preemptory
challenge
rather
than
by
a
challenge
for
cause
deprived
the
petitioner
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
the
second
issue
that
is
presented
is
whether
the
circumstances
of
the
removal
of
that
potential
juror
deprived
the
petitioner
of
life
or
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
the
third
question
as
presented
by
the
petitioner
is
if
there
was
a
constitutional
violation,
is
that
violation
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
three
issues
that
i
think
are
not
present
in
this
case
are
that
this
is
not
a
witherspoon
death-prone
jury
case.
this
is
not
a
batson
improper-racial
exclusion
case.
and
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
there
is
any
demonstrable,
articulatable
bias
or
prejudice
on
the
jury
that
actually
sat.
as
i
think
is
agreed
here,
trial
counsel
accepted
for
cause
each
and
every
juror
who
sat
and
made
no
objection
to
those
jurors,
but
only
complained
that
there
were
no
blacks
on
the
jury
and
that
the
petitioner
was,
therefore,
denied
a
fair
trial
by
a
jury
of
his
peers.
i'd
like
very
briefly
to
summarize
why
i
believe
that
the
circumstances
of
this
case
present
no
constitutional
error,
and
why
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
this
court
has
stated,
and
i
think
it
appears
conceded
here,
that
preemptory
challenges
in
this
sort
of
case
are
creatures
of
state
law
rather
than
creatures
of
constitutional
law.
some
members
of
this
court
over
the
years
have
sought
the
complete
abolition
of
preemptory
challenges
in
criminal
cases.
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
constitution
requires
a
fair
trial
before
an
impartial
and
differently-chosen
jury
and
there
is
no
argument
whatsoever
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
not
receive
such
a
trial.
there
is
no
allegation
here
that
the
judge's
error
with
regard
to
juror
huling
or
potential
juror
huling
affected
the
impartiality
of
the
jury
that
actually
sat.
we
believe
the
oklahoma
statutes
in
this
case
do
not
create
a
substantial
and
legitimate
expectation
of
influence,
direct
influence
over
the
deprivation
of
life
or
liberty
and,
therefore,
preemptory
challenges
as
a
state
right
are
not
constitutionalized
by
the
due
process
clause.
the
longstanding
oklahoma
law
which
requires
the
use
of
a
preemptory
challenge
to
correct
a
trial
judge's
error
on
a
challenge
for
cause
is
a
reasonable
and
legitimate
state
rule
which
benefits
both
the
petitioner
or
the
criminal
defendant
and
the
state.
the
error
in
this
case,
as
we
see
it,
did
not
affect
a
specific
constitutional
right
and,
therefore,
we
are
bound
by
the
narrow
due
process
formula
of
fundamental
fairness
and
that
there
was
nothing
about
the
procedures
in
the
trial
court
that
was
fundamentally
unfair.
the
trial
was
fair.
guilt
was
reliably
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
the
petitioner
had
competent
trial
counsel.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
it
was
an
error,
your
honor.
so,
i
would
say
that
it
was
not
fair.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
an
error
may
or
may
not
affect
the
fairness
of
the
whole
trial.
i
think
the
trial
judge
was
wrong,
but
there
were
inconsistent
statements
by
the
particular
juror.
on
two
occasions,
he
said
that
he
would
not
consider
anything
but
death.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
he
never
did,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
well,
i
don't
guess
you
could
assume
that
i
speak
for
the
judge.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
i
don't...
i
wouldn't
pass
myself
off
as
reading
his
mind.
i
could
talk
about
what's
in
the
record.
he
said
twice
that
he
would
only
impose
death,
but
he
told
the
prosecutor
once
and
the
defense
lawyer
once
that
he
would
consider
a
life
sentence.
so,
he
basically
kind
of
said
i'll
go
this
way
and
i
think
the
trial
judge
was
wrong,
but
he
wasn't
flagrantly
wrong
or
flagrantly
unconstitutional.
i
wouldn't
say
that.
i
think
as
justice
o'connor
stated,
in
our
view,
at
the
end
of
it,
there
was
no
error
because
of
the
availability
of
a
preemptory
challenge,
and
in
any
event,
as
the
court
has
said
and
as
has
been
conceded,
preemptory
challenges
aren't
constitutionally
required.
in
some
of
the
earlier
cases,--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--i
frankly
don't
know,
your
honor.
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
that
wouldn't
surprise
me,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
state
where
the
converse
happens.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
i
think
there
very
well
could
be
because
that
would
be,
at
least
in
my
mind,
fundamentally
unfair.
unless
there
was
a
question
in
the
first
argument
about
empirical
evidence
that
showed
jurors
leaned
to
the
defense
and
you
had
to
rebalance
it.
in
the
absence
of
something
very
good
along
those
lines,
i'd
say
that
would
make
things
unfair.
i
need
to
take
issue,
i
think,
with--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--i
think
so.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
that's
true.
that's
precisely
what
we
say.
i
need
to
take
issue,
if
i
may,
with
the
argument
that
the
petitioner
only
got
eight
and
the
state
got
nine.
the
oklahoma
law
and
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
and
in
the
farrell
case,
which
was
an
oklahoma
case,
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
this
opinion,
and
i
think
in
the
stock
case,
which
i
mentioned
in
the
first
argument,
has
long
required
the
use
of
preemptory
challenges
to
correct
an
error
of
this
sort.
so,
to
say
what
the
law
in
oklahoma
requires
based
on
the
statute
and
ignoring
the
case
law
doesn't
fully
characterize
and
fairly
characterize
what
the
law
is.
the
petitioner
had
a
legitimate
expectation
to
nine
preemptories,
and
he
got
them
and
used
every
one.
one
of
them
he
used
to
correct
what
i
concede
was
an
error,
but
that
is
consistent
with
the
oklahoma
scheme
of
things
and
he
didn't
lose
anything
that
had
been
granted
him
thereby
nor
was
there
a
different
rule
really
imposed
in
this
case
than
there
would
be
in
any
other
criminal
case
in
oklahoma
in
which
something
similar
happened.
the
court
has
said
that
nothing
in
the
constitution
requires
the
grant
of
preemptories,
but
the
trial
by
impartial
jury
is
what
is
required.
so,
i
turn
my
emphasis
to
looking
at
whether
or
not
the
trial
was
impartial.
in
lockhart,
this
court
said
that
the
constitution
presupposes
a
jury
selected
from
a
fair
cross
section
of
the
community
is
impartial,
regardless
of
the
mix
of
individual
viewpoints
on
that
jury,
so
long
as
the
jurors
can
conscientiously
and
properly
carry
out
their
sworn
duty
under
the
law,
and
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
there
is
no
argument
whatsoever
in
this
case
that
the
jury
that
sat
in
mr.
ross'
trial
did
not
meet
that
standard.
there
was
a
potential
witherspoon
problem
had
mr.
huling
been
seated,
but
the
use
of
the
preemptory
challenge
was
a
self-correcting
mechanism
that
took
care
of
that
problem.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
trial
counsel
wanted
or
needed
additional
preemptory
challenges,
and
that's
significant.
i
think
we
can
get
into
trouble
if
we
try
to
adhere
too
closely
to
gray.
if
the
trial
lawyer
had
had
a
problem,
had
had
a
real
problem
with
that
jury,
he
could
have
spoken
up
and
should
have
spoken
up
and
tried
to
get
the
judge
to
give
him
a
preemptory
back
or
articulate
that
problem
that
he
was
trying
to
remove.
that
would
have
shown,
whether
he
was
successful
or
not,
that
would
have
shown
the
possibility
of
some
problem
with
that
jury,
which
simply
is
not
there.
he
didn't
ask
for
additional
preemptories
after
the
mistake
was
made.
he
didn't
argue
that
he
had
been
improperly
deprived
of
a
preemptory
or
that
the
ruling
on
the
challenge
for
cause
was
wrong.
he
only
complained,
as
i
said
before,
that
there
were
no
blacks
on
the
jury
and
he
didn't
think
his
client
could
get
a
fair
trial
by
a
jury
of
his
peers.
that
jury
that
was
seated
was
indifferently
chosen
and
was
accepted
by
that
lawyer
as
a
jury
in
which
there
was
no
one
who
was
challengeable
for
cause.
no
one
biased
or
prejudiced
on
that
jury.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
it
was
in
cheyenne,
your
honor,
which
is
in
roger
mills
county.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
it's
in
far
western
oklahoma.
it
abuts
the
texas
panhandle.
there
was
no
allegation
at
trial
and
there's
really
no
allegation
even
now
that
there
was
any
specific
problem
of
bias
or
prejudice
with
any
specific
juror
on
that
jury.
if
there
were,
either
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
or
this
court
could
address
that
problem.
instead,
we
want
basically
or
the
petitioner
wants
basically
in
this
case
a
rule
of
reversal
without
showing
of
prejudice,
and
i
think
justice
kennedy's
question
is
apropos.
you
would
have
a
rule
of
automatic
reversal
every
time
there
had
been
an
erroneous
ruling
on
a
challenge
for
cause
that
required
you
to
use
a
preemptory.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
it
does,
your
honor.
it
does
point
in
that
direction
and
that,
of
course,
is
one
part
of
the
gray
opinion
i
like
and
would
like
the
court
not
to
speculate
about
the
jury
that
might
have
been
impanelled,
but
to
look
at
the
fairness
of
this
jury
because
there
simply
isn't
any
complaint
that
can
be
made
about
it.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
well,
as
i
recall
gray,
there
was
a
woman
excluded
who
should
have
been
seated
under
witherspoon
and
went
out
on
a
challenge
for
cause.
so,
there
was
a
witherspoon,
if
i'm
remembering
gray
correctly,
there
was
a
witherspoon
error
in
gray,
and
under
those
circumstances,
circumstances
which
aren't
present
here,
the
court
said
it
would
not
speculate
on
what
the
jury
might--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
that's
correct.
i
would
agree
mr.
huling
should
not
have
sat
and
ultimately,
of
course,
didn't
sit.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
that
is
also
correct,
although--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--if
you
say
so,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
i
follow.
but,
in
any
event,
i
assume
all
of
the
jurors
or
potential
jurors
we're
talking
about
are
fair
jurors,
and
you're
talking
about
the
substitution
of
one
fair
juror
for
another.
i
don't
think
that
anywhere
in
the
scheme
of
things
there
was
one
right
jury
for
this
case,
and
it
was
just
a
matter
of--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--well,
you
could
make
the
argument,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
persuasive,
and
i
think
it
probably
would
be
fundamentally
unfair.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
well,
if,
on
the
one
hand,
for
instance,
you're
permitting
the
state
just
to
keep
excluding
until
it's
perfectly
happy,--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
suppose
there
comes
a
time
when
a
difference
of
degree
becomes
a
difference
in
kind,
and--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--well,
i
guess
i
have
to
differ
with
the
idea
that
it
was
unequal
in
this
case.
but
accepting
that,
eight
to
nine
isn't
very
serious.
that's...
i
couldn't
have
said
that
any
better.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
just
so,
your
honor.
that--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--correct.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
and
it
could
have
happened
the
other
way,
that
there
might
have
been
a
juror
who
should
have
come
off
under
witherspoon
and
didn't.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
it
would,
indeed,
be
error.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one
is
that
in
this
case,
the
judge
acting
as
a
judge
simply
made
a
mistake.
in
that
case,
where
the
law
guarantees
both
sides
nine,
he
just
says--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--well,
it
was
just
a
mistake
of
law
or
whatever
that--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--well,
it
would
clearly
be
erroneous,
and
it
probably
would
be--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--it
would
be
error.
it
would
definitely
be
error.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
yes,
but
before
i
get
into--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--well,
your
honor,
it
would
clearly
be
an
error
of
the
common
law
of
preemptory
challenges
or
the
statutory
law
of
preemptory
challenges
in
oklahoma.
i
don't
know
and
i'm
not
really
willing
to
concede
that
it
would
make
the
trial
fundamentally
unfair,
which
i
think
would
be
the
more
narrow
ground
that
this
court
would
look
at
it
on.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
i
think
not
there,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--and
then
you
have
a
serious
suspicion
of
a
biased
judge
or
whatever.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
well,
yes,
and
that's
the
point
of
the
difference
in
degree
becoming
a
difference
in
kind.
you'd
have
what
at
eight
and
nine
may
not
look
very
serious,
begins
to
look
very
serious,
indeed,
if
it
went
all
the
way.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
due
process
argument.
unlike
hicks
v.
oklahoma,
the
law
in
preemptory
challenges
in
this
case
does
not
create
a
substantial
and
legitimate
expectation
of
direct
influence
from
the
deprivation
of
life
or
liberty.
in
hicks,
this
court
said
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
protected
the
oklahoma
provisions
for
jury
sentencing
because
the
jury
directly
fixed
the
terms
of
the
fundamental
deprivation
of
liberty.
i
don't
read
anything
in
hicks
to
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
constitutionalizes
every
trial
procedure
or
provision
of
state
law
for
criminal
trials.
the
petitioner,
i
think,
in
this
case,
had
a
substantial
and
a
legitimate
expectation
to
nine
preemptories
with
the
traditional
caveat
of
oklahoma
law
that
if
the
judge
erred
on
a
challenge
for
cause,
you
had
to
use
a
preemptory
to
correct
that
in
the
first
instance.
he,
of
course,
received
his
nine
and
used
them
in
one
case
to
remove
juror
huling.
i
think
the
use
of
preemptory
challenges
is
too
tangential
to
the
final
verdict
and
sentencing
to
give
a
substantial
and
legitimate
expectation
of
influence
over
the
verdict
or
deprivation
of
life
or
liberty
because,
of
course,
there's
been
no
evidence
taken,
no
argument
made,
no
instruction
by
the
court,
no
deliberation
by
the
jury.
it's
one
of
the
earliest
things
that
happens
in
a
trial,
and
one
error
in
that
case
with
the
law
of
preemptory
challenges,
i
think,
is
just
too
attenuating.
the
petitioner
in
the
brief
also
relies
on
the
logan
v.
zimmerman
brush
case
and
makes
the
argument,
which
has
been
advanced
here,
that
there's
an
oklahoma
procedure
that
deprives
him
of
his
right
to
preemptories.
i
think
that
is
based
upon
the
false
premise
that
preemptories
have
to
be
in
oklahoma
completely
free
and
clear
of
any
interference.
as
we
discussed
before,
both
sides
have,
there
is
a
state
procedure
that
requires
their
use
to
correct
errors.
the
petitioner
cited
some
cases.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
relied
on
the
farrell
case.
i
cited
stock,
i
think,
in
the
first
argument,
but
unlike
the
irrational
state
procedure
which
in
logan
deprived
the
plaintiff
of
his
right
to
a
cause
of
action,
this
rule
is
a
reasonable
rule.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
well,
i
think
the
purpose
for
the
rule
is
to
remove
error
in
the
first
instance,
to
remove
it
when
it
can
be
addressed
by
the
trial
court,
much
like
making
you
object
to
improper
evidence.
once
it's
in,
it's
in.
so,
you
have
to
make
a
timely
objection
and
apprise
the
court
of
why
you
think
this
evidence
shouldn't
come
in
or
a
confession
or
whatever
it
is.
and
that
point
is
legitimate.
i
suppose
there
could
be
an
element
of
worrying
about
the
defense
just
challenging
everyone
for
cause
and
trying
to
build
error.
i
think
the
main
thing
is
to
require
the
defense
to
correct
that
error
when
it's
correctable,
not
try
the
case
and
go
up
on
appeal
and
have
to
do
it
again,
and
that's
legitimate.
if,
in
fact,
there
is
a
biased
juror
or
a
biased
potential
juror,
to
make
the
defense
take
him
off,
and
the
equality
of
it
is
in
the
other
case,
as
in
gray,
i
guess,
if
there
was
someone
who
just
said
adamantly
they
would
never
consider
the
death
penalty,
and
there
is
a
challenge
for
cause
made
and
not
sustained,
then
the
prosecution
has
to
take
them
off.
the
circumstances
of
that
rule
could
go
either
way
in
individual
cases,
but
the
rule
is
the
same
either
way,
and
the
law,
of
course,
benefits
the
state
by
making
those
trials
which
really
ought
to
be
socially
significant
events
as
error-free
as
possible
and,
therefore,
our
rule
is
not
the
irrational
sort
of
rule
the
court
condemned
in
logan.
on
the
harmless
error
question,
i
think
it
is
clear
and
i
don't
hear
any
argument
to
the
contrary
that
the
error
in
this
case
did
not
affect
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
jury.
i
don't
hear
any
evidence...
i
hear
hints,
but
i
don't
hear
any
serious
argument
that
the
error
in
this
trial
did
not
affect
any
of
the
non-truth-seeking
constitutional
values
that
the
court
would
be
interested
in,
like
having
racial
bias.
in
batson,
a
racially-biased
jury
may
or
may
not
be
fair
to
the
defendant,
but
there
are
independent
constitutional
grounds
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
equal
protection
clause,
that
just
say
we're
not
going
to
permit
it.
whether
that
jury
is
in
any
given
case
fair
or
not,
we
won't
permit
racial
discrimination.
there's
no
argument
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
error
in
that
sort
of
constitutional
value,
and
unlike
in
gray,
there
was
no
tribunal
impanelled
to
return
a
verdict
of
death,
and,
so,
i
think
the
petitioner's
suggested
rule
that
anything
that
would
change
the
composition
of
the
jury
really
doesn't
apply
because
it
kind
of
takes
that
part
of
gray
out
of
context.
in
gray,
there
had
been
a
witherspoon
violation.
here,
there
has
not
been.
there's
been
some
suggestion
now
that
there
was
evidence
in
dispute,
particularly
about
the
intent
to
kill.
i
think
not.
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
that
the
petitioner
shot
a
police
officer
in
the
head
with
a
25
calibre
pistol
at
close
range
three
times.
i
just
cannot
see
any
conceivable
circumstances
in
the
fact
when
a
man
who
does
that
doesn't
intend
to
kill.
the
evidence
was
that
as
he
left
the
robbery
of
a
motel,
the
police
officer
drove
up,
he
shot
the
police
officer,
was
arrested
in
a
nearby
town
half
an
hour
away,
half
an
hour
later.
the
murder
weapon
when
he
was
patted
down
was
found
in
his
pocket.
the
officer's
service
revolver
was
found
next
to
the
seat
where
he
was
sitting.
the
booty
from
the
robbery
was
in
his
car.
his
foot
print
matched
the
foot
print
at
the
scene.
he
was
identified
as
one
of
the
robbers,
and
after
being
mirandized,
he
confessed.
there
is
simply
no
question
about
the
evidence
of
this
man's
guilt.
in
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
jury
found
five
aggravating
circumstances.
this
court
has
stated
that
when
a
person
is
tried
to
an
impartial
jury
and
has
counsel,
you
can
strongly
presume
that
any
other
error
is
harmless.
counsel
suggests
that
harmless
error
in
jury
selection
just
doesn't
work
and
it
would
be
unprecedented.
i,
of
course,
don't
want
you
to
find
any
constitutional
error,
but
i
can
explain
why
i
think
harmless
error
would
apply
in
this
case.
that
is,
because
your
usual
jury
selection
error
occurs
because
there
is
some
sort
of
bias
that
has
happened
to
that
jury.
whether
it's
racial
bias
or
it's
bias
because
of
pre-trial
publicity
or
there's
bias
because
people
in
the
jury
know
the
defendant
and
think
he's
a
rascal
or
whatever,
there
is
some
bias
on
that
jury,
and
under
the
harmless
error
doctrine,
you
assume
there's
been
an
impartial
decision-maker
or
the
other
kind
of
jury
error
is
a
non-fact-finding/non-biased
prejudice-kind
of
error
that's,
for
instance,
based
on
a
race,
that
the
court
just
says
and
rightly
so
won't
be
tolerated.
this
court
has
previously
stated
that
it
should
affirm
where
a
finding
of
guilt
is
made
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
that
everyone
is
entitled
to
a
fair
trial
but
not
a
perfect
one.
the
central
purpose
of
the
criminal
trial
is
the
factual
determination
of
guilt,
and
it
was
determined
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
unquestionably
in
this
case.
the
court
has
stated
that
it
shouldn't
reverse
for
inconsequential
errors
because
that
encourages
litigants
to
abuse
the
judicial
process
and
the
public
to
ridicule
it.
that
would
be
the
precise
result
here.
if
there
were
an
initial
preliminary
error
in
the
jury
selection
in
an
otherwise
fair
trial
in
which
the
defendant
is
clearly
guilty,
the
public
would
be
dumbfounded,
i
must
submit,
and
would
only
be
caused
to
disrespect
the
judicial
process.
any
error,
if
it
was
constitutional,
and
we
think
it
was
not,
is
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
didn't
affect
or
abort
the
trial
process.
therefore,
for
those
reasons,
we
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
if
you
have
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
presentation.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
issues
presented
in
this
case,
and
i
believe
there
are
three
that
are
not.
the
first
is
whether
the
circumstances
of
the
removal
of
potential
juror
huling
from
the
panel
by
a
preemptory
challenge
rather
than
by
a
challenge
for
cause
deprived
the
petitioner
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
the
second
issue
that
is
presented
is
whether
the
circumstances
of
the
removal
of
that
potential
juror
deprived
the
petitioner
of
life
or
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
the
third
question
as
presented
by
the
petitioner
is
if
there
was
a
constitutional
violation,
is
that
violation
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
three
issues
that
i
think
are
not
present
in
this
case
are
that
this
is
not
a
witherspoon
death-prone
jury
case.
this
is
not
a
batson
improper-racial
exclusion
case.
and
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
there
is
any
demonstrable,
articulatable
bias
or
prejudice
on
the
jury
that
actually
sat.
as
i
think
is
agreed
here,
trial
counsel
accepted
for
cause
each
and
every
juror
who
sat
and
made
no
objection
to
those
jurors,
but
only
complained
that
there
were
no
blacks
on
the
jury
and
that
the
petitioner
was,
therefore,
denied
a
fair
trial
by
a
jury
of
his
peers.
i'd
like
very
briefly
to
summarize
why
i
believe
that
the
circumstances
of
this
case
present
no
constitutional
error,
and
why
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
this
court
has
stated,
and
i
think
it
appears
conceded
here,
that
preemptory
challenges
in
this
sort
of
case
are
creatures
of
state
law
rather
than
creatures
of
constitutional
law.
some
members
of
this
court
over
the
years
have
sought
the
complete
abolition
of
preemptory
challenges
in
criminal
cases.
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
constitution
requires
a
fair
trial
before
an
impartial
and
differently-chosen
jury
and
there
is
no
argument
whatsoever
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
not
receive
such
a
trial.
there
is
no
allegation
here
that
the
judge's
error
with
regard
to
juror
huling
or
potential
juror
huling
affected
the
impartiality
of
the
jury
that
actually
sat.
we
believe
the
oklahoma
statutes
in
this
case
do
not
create
a
substantial
and
legitimate
expectation
of
influence,
direct
influence
over
the
deprivation
of
life
or
liberty
and,
therefore,
preemptory
challenges
as
a
state
right
are
not
constitutionalized
by
the
due
process
clause.
the
longstanding
oklahoma
law
which
requires
the
use
of
a
preemptory
challenge
to
correct
a
trial
judge's
error
on
a
challenge
for
cause
is
a
reasonable
and
legitimate
state
rule
which
benefits
both
the
petitioner
or
the
criminal
defendant
and
the
state.
the
error
in
this
case,
as
we
see
it,
did
not
affect
a
specific
constitutional
right
and,
therefore,
we
are
bound
by
the
narrow
due
process
formula
of
fundamental
fairness
and
that
there
was
nothing
about
the
procedures
in
the
trial
court
that
was
fundamentally
unfair.
the
trial
was
fair.
guilt
was
reliably
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
the
petitioner
had
competent
trial
counsel.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
it
was
an
error,
your
honor.
so,
i
would
say
that
it
was
not
fair.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
an
error
may
or
may
not
affect
the
fairness
of
the
whole
trial.
i
think
the
trial
judge
was
wrong,
but
there
were
inconsistent
statements
by
the
particular
juror.
on
two
occasions,
he
said
that
he
would
not
consider
anything
but
death.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
he
never
did,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
well,
i
don't
guess
you
could
assume
that
i
speak
for
the
judge.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
i
don't...
i
wouldn't
pass
myself
off
as
reading
his
mind.
i
could
talk
about
what's
in
the
record.
he
said
twice
that
he
would
only
impose
death,
but
he
told
the
prosecutor
once
and
the
defense
lawyer
once
that
he
would
consider
a
life
sentence.
so,
he
basically
kind
of
said
i'll
go
this
way
and
i
think
the
trial
judge
was
wrong,
but
he
wasn't
flagrantly
wrong
or
flagrantly
unconstitutional.
i
wouldn't
say
that.
i
think
as
justice
o'connor
stated,
in
our
view,
at
the
end
of
it,
there
was
no
error
because
of
the
availability
of
a
preemptory
challenge,
and
in
any
event,
as
the
court
has
said
and
as
has
been
conceded,
preemptory
challenges
aren't
constitutionally
required.
in
some
of
the
earlier
cases,--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--i
frankly
don't
know,
your
honor.
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
that
wouldn't
surprise
me,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
state
where
the
converse
happens.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
i
think
there
very
well
could
be
because
that
would
be,
at
least
in
my
mind,
fundamentally
unfair.
unless
there
was
a
question
in
the
first
argument
about
empirical
evidence
that
showed
jurors
leaned
to
the
defense
and
you
had
to
rebalance
it.
in
the
absence
of
something
very
good
along
those
lines,
i'd
say
that
would
make
things
unfair.
i
need
to
take
issue,
i
think,
with--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--i
think
so.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
that's
true.
that's
precisely
what
we
say.
i
need
to
take
issue,
if
i
may,
with
the
argument
that
the
petitioner
only
got
eight
and
the
state
got
nine.
the
oklahoma
law
and
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
and
in
the
farrell
case,
which
was
an
oklahoma
case,
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
this
opinion,
and
i
think
in
the
stock
case,
which
i
mentioned
in
the
first
argument,
has
long
required
the
use
of
preemptory
challenges
to
correct
an
error
of
this
sort.
so,
to
say
what
the
law
in
oklahoma
requires
based
on
the
statute
and
ignoring
the
case
law
doesn't
fully
characterize
and
fairly
characterize
what
the
law
is.
the
petitioner
had
a
legitimate
expectation
to
nine
preemptories,
and
he
got
them
and
used
every
one.
one
of
them
he
used
to
correct
what
i
concede
was
an
error,
but
that
is
consistent
with
the
oklahoma
scheme
of
things
and
he
didn't
lose
anything
that
had
been
granted
him
thereby
nor
was
there
a
different
rule
really
imposed
in
this
case
than
there
would
be
in
any
other
criminal
case
in
oklahoma
in
which
something
similar
happened.
the
court
has
said
that
nothing
in
the
constitution
requires
the
grant
of
preemptories,
but
the
trial
by
impartial
jury
is
what
is
required.
so,
i
turn
my
emphasis
to
looking
at
whether
or
not
the
trial
was
impartial.
in
lockhart,
this
court
said
that
the
constitution
presupposes
a
jury
selected
from
a
fair
cross
section
of
the
community
is
impartial,
regardless
of
the
mix
of
individual
viewpoints
on
that
jury,
so
long
as
the
jurors
can
conscientiously
and
properly
carry
out
their
sworn
duty
under
the
law,
and
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
there
is
no
argument
whatsoever
in
this
case
that
the
jury
that
sat
in
mr.
ross'
trial
did
not
meet
that
standard.
there
was
a
potential
witherspoon
problem
had
mr.
huling
been
seated,
but
the
use
of
the
preemptory
challenge
was
a
self-correcting
mechanism
that
took
care
of
that
problem.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
trial
counsel
wanted
or
needed
additional
preemptory
challenges,
and
that's
significant.
i
think
we
can
get
into
trouble
if
we
try
to
adhere
too
closely
to
gray.
if
the
trial
lawyer
had
had
a
problem,
had
had
a
real
problem
with
that
jury,
he
could
have
spoken
up
and
should
have
spoken
up
and
tried
to
get
the
judge
to
give
him
a
preemptory
back
or
articulate
that
problem
that
he
was
trying
to
remove.
that
would
have
shown,
whether
he
was
successful
or
not,
that
would
have
shown
the
possibility
of
some
problem
with
that
jury,
which
simply
is
not
there.
he
didn't
ask
for
additional
preemptories
after
the
mistake
was
made.
he
didn't
argue
that
he
had
been
improperly
deprived
of
a
preemptory
or
that
the
ruling
on
the
challenge
for
cause
was
wrong.
he
only
complained,
as
i
said
before,
that
there
were
no
blacks
on
the
jury
and
he
didn't
think
his
client
could
get
a
fair
trial
by
a
jury
of
his
peers.
that
jury
that
was
seated
was
indifferently
chosen
and
was
accepted
by
that
lawyer
as
a
jury
in
which
there
was
no
one
who
was
challengeable
for
cause.
no
one
biased
or
prejudiced
on
that
jury.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
it
was
in
cheyenne,
your
honor,
which
is
in
roger
mills
county.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
it's
in
far
western
oklahoma.
it
abuts
the
texas
panhandle.
there
was
no
allegation
at
trial
and
there's
really
no
allegation
even
now
that
there
was
any
specific
problem
of
bias
or
prejudice
with
any
specific
juror
on
that
jury.
if
there
were,
either
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
or
this
court
could
address
that
problem.
instead,
we
want
basically
or
the
petitioner
wants
basically
in
this
case
a
rule
of
reversal
without
showing
of
prejudice,
and
i
think
justice
kennedy's
question
is
apropos.
you
would
have
a
rule
of
automatic
reversal
every
time
there
had
been
an
erroneous
ruling
on
a
challenge
for
cause
that
required
you
to
use
a
preemptory.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
it
does,
your
honor.
it
does
point
in
that
direction
and
that,
of
course,
is
one
part
of
the
gray
opinion
i
like
and
would
like
the
court
not
to
speculate
about
the
jury
that
might
have
been
impanelled,
but
to
look
at
the
fairness
of
this
jury
because
there
simply
isn't
any
complaint
that
can
be
made
about
it.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
well,
as
i
recall
gray,
there
was
a
woman
excluded
who
should
have
been
seated
under
witherspoon
and
went
out
on
a
challenge
for
cause.
so,
there
was
a
witherspoon,
if
i'm
remembering
gray
correctly,
there
was
a
witherspoon
error
in
gray,
and
under
those
circumstances,
circumstances
which
aren't
present
here,
the
court
said
it
would
not
speculate
on
what
the
jury
might--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
that's
correct.
i
would
agree
mr.
huling
should
not
have
sat
and
ultimately,
of
course,
didn't
sit.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
that
is
also
correct,
although--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--if
you
say
so,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
i
follow.
but,
in
any
event,
i
assume
all
of
the
jurors
or
potential
jurors
we're
talking
about
are
fair
jurors,
and
you're
talking
about
the
substitution
of
one
fair
juror
for
another.
i
don't
think
that
anywhere
in
the
scheme
of
things
there
was
one
right
jury
for
this
case,
and
it
was
just
a
matter
of--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--well,
you
could
make
the
argument,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
persuasive,
and
i
think
it
probably
would
be
fundamentally
unfair.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
well,
if,
on
the
one
hand,
for
instance,
you're
permitting
the
state
just
to
keep
excluding
until
it's
perfectly
happy,--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
suppose
there
comes
a
time
when
a
difference
of
degree
becomes
a
difference
in
kind,
and--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--well,
i
guess
i
have
to
differ
with
the
idea
that
it
was
unequal
in
this
case.
but
accepting
that,
eight
to
nine
isn't
very
serious.
that's...
i
couldn't
have
said
that
any
better.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
just
so,
your
honor.
that--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--correct.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
and
it
could
have
happened
the
other
way,
that
there
might
have
been
a
juror
who
should
have
come
off
under
witherspoon
and
didn't.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
it
would,
indeed,
be
error.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one
is
that
in
this
case,
the
judge
acting
as
a
judge
simply
made
a
mistake.
in
that
case,
where
the
law
guarantees
both
sides
nine,
he
just
says--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--well,
it
was
just
a
mistake
of
law
or
whatever
that--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--well,
it
would
clearly
be
erroneous,
and
it
probably
would
be--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--it
would
be
error.
it
would
definitely
be
error.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
yes,
but
before
i
get
into--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--well,
your
honor,
it
would
clearly
be
an
error
of
the
common
law
of
preemptory
challenges
or
the
statutory
law
of
preemptory
challenges
in
oklahoma.
i
don't
know
and
i'm
not
really
willing
to
concede
that
it
would
make
the
trial
fundamentally
unfair,
which
i
think
would
be
the
more
narrow
ground
that
this
court
would
look
at
it
on.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
i
think
not
there,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--and
then
you
have
a
serious
suspicion
of
a
biased
judge
or
whatever.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
well,
yes,
and
that's
the
point
of
the
difference
in
degree
becoming
a
difference
in
kind.
you'd
have
what
at
eight
and
nine
may
not
look
very
serious,
begins
to
look
very
serious,
indeed,
if
it
went
all
the
way.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
due
process
argument.
unlike
hicks
v.
oklahoma,
the
law
in
preemptory
challenges
in
this
case
does
not
create
a
substantial
and
legitimate
expectation
of
direct
influence
from
the
deprivation
of
life
or
liberty.
in
hicks,
this
court
said
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
protected
the
oklahoma
provisions
for
jury
sentencing
because
the
jury
directly
fixed
the
terms
of
the
fundamental
deprivation
of
liberty.
i
don't
read
anything
in
hicks
to
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
constitutionalizes
every
trial
procedure
or
provision
of
state
law
for
criminal
trials.
the
petitioner,
i
think,
in
this
case,
had
a
substantial
and
a
legitimate
expectation
to
nine
preemptories
with
the
traditional
caveat
of
oklahoma
law
that
if
the
judge
erred
on
a
challenge
for
cause,
you
had
to
use
a
preemptory
to
correct
that
in
the
first
instance.
he,
of
course,
received
his
nine
and
used
them
in
one
case
to
remove
juror
huling.
i
think
the
use
of
preemptory
challenges
is
too
tangential
to
the
final
verdict
and
sentencing
to
give
a
substantial
and
legitimate
expectation
of
influence
over
the
verdict
or
deprivation
of
life
or
liberty
because,
of
course,
there's
been
no
evidence
taken,
no
argument
made,
no
instruction
by
the
court,
no
deliberation
by
the
jury.
it's
one
of
the
earliest
things
that
happens
in
a
trial,
and
one
error
in
that
case
with
the
law
of
preemptory
challenges,
i
think,
is
just
too
attenuating.
the
petitioner
in
the
brief
also
relies
on
the
logan
v.
zimmerman
brush
case
and
makes
the
argument,
which
has
been
advanced
here,
that
there's
an
oklahoma
procedure
that
deprives
him
of
his
right
to
preemptories.
i
think
that
is
based
upon
the
false
premise
that
preemptories
have
to
be
in
oklahoma
completely
free
and
clear
of
any
interference.
as
we
discussed
before,
both
sides
have,
there
is
a
state
procedure
that
requires
their
use
to
correct
errors.
the
petitioner
cited
some
cases.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
relied
on
the
farrell
case.
i
cited
stock,
i
think,
in
the
first
argument,
but
unlike
the
irrational
state
procedure
which
in
logan
deprived
the
plaintiff
of
his
right
to
a
cause
of
action,
this
rule
is
a
reasonable
rule.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
well,
i
think
the
purpose
for
the
rule
is
to
remove
error
in
the
first
instance,
to
remove
it
when
it
can
be
addressed
by
the
trial
court,
much
like
making
you
object
to
improper
evidence.
once
it's
in,
it's
in.
so,
you
have
to
make
a
timely
objection
and
apprise
the
court
of
why
you
think
this
evidence
shouldn't
come
in
or
a
confession
or
whatever
it
is.
and
that
point
is
legitimate.
i
suppose
there
could
be
an
element
of
worrying
about
the
defense
just
challenging
everyone
for
cause
and
trying
to
build
error.
i
think
the
main
thing
is
to
require
the
defense
to
correct
that
error
when
it's
correctable,
not
try
the
case
and
go
up
on
appeal
and
have
to
do
it
again,
and
that's
legitimate.
if,
in
fact,
there
is
a
biased
juror
or
a
biased
potential
juror,
to
make
the
defense
take
him
off,
and
the
equality
of
it
is
in
the
other
case,
as
in
gray,
i
guess,
if
there
was
someone
who
just
said
adamantly
they
would
never
consider
the
death
penalty,
and
there
is
a
challenge
for
cause
made
and
not
sustained,
then
the
prosecution
has
to
take
them
off.
the
circumstances
of
that
rule
could
go
either
way
in
individual
cases,
but
the
rule
is
the
same
either
way,
and
the
law,
of
course,
benefits
the
state
by
making
those
trials
which
really
ought
to
be
socially
significant
events
as
error-free
as
possible
and,
therefore,
our
rule
is
not
the
irrational
sort
of
rule
the
court
condemned
in
logan.
on
the
harmless
error
question,
i
think
it
is
clear
and
i
don't
hear
any
argument
to
the
contrary
that
the
error
in
this
case
did
not
affect
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
jury.
i
don't
hear
any
evidence...
i
hear
hints,
but
i
don't
hear
any
serious
argument
that
the
error
in
this
trial
did
not
affect
any
of
the
non-truth-seeking
constitutional
values
that
the
court
would
be
interested
in,
like
having
racial
bias.
in
batson,
a
racially-biased
jury
may
or
may
not
be
fair
to
the
defendant,
but
there
are
independent
constitutional
grounds
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
equal
protection
clause,
that
just
say
we're
not
going
to
permit
it.
whether
that
jury
is
in
any
given
case
fair
or
not,
we
won't
permit
racial
discrimination.
there's
no
argument
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
error
in
that
sort
of
constitutional
value,
and
unlike
in
gray,
there
was
no
tribunal
impanelled
to
return
a
verdict
of
death,
and,
so,
i
think
the
petitioner's
suggested
rule
that
anything
that
would
change
the
composition
of
the
jury
really
doesn't
apply
because
it
kind
of
takes
that
part
of
gray
out
of
context.
in
gray,
there
had
been
a
witherspoon
violation.
here,
there
has
not
been.
there's
been
some
suggestion
now
that
there
was
evidence
in
dispute,
particularly
about
the
intent
to
kill.
i
think
not.
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
that
the
petitioner
shot
a
police
officer
in
the
head
with
a
25
calibre
pistol
at
close
range
three
times.
i
just
cannot
see
any
conceivable
circumstances
in
the
fact
when
a
man
who
does
that
doesn't
intend
to
kill.
the
evidence
was
that
as
he
left
the
robbery
of
a
motel,
the
police
officer
drove
up,
he
shot
the
police
officer,
was
arrested
in
a
nearby
town
half
an
hour
away,
half
an
hour
later.
the
murder
weapon
when
he
was
patted
down
was
found
in
his
pocket.
the
officer's
service
revolver
was
found
next
to
the
seat
where
he
was
sitting.
the
booty
from
the
robbery
was
in
his
car.
his
foot
print
matched
the
foot
print
at
the
scene.
he
was
identified
as
one
of
the
robbers,
and
after
being
mirandized,
he
confessed.
there
is
simply
no
question
about
the
evidence
of
this
man's
guilt.
in
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
jury
found
five
aggravating
circumstances.
this
court
has
stated
that
when
a
person
is
tried
to
an
impartial
jury
and
has
counsel,
you
can
strongly
presume
that
any
other
error
is
harmless.
counsel
suggests
that
harmless
error
in
jury
selection
just
doesn't
work
and
it
would
be
unprecedented.
i,
of
course,
don't
want
you
to
find
any
constitutional
error,
but
i
can
explain
why
i
think
harmless
error
would
apply
in
this
case.
that
is,
because
your
usual
jury
selection
error
occurs
because
there
is
some
sort
of
bias
that
has
happened
to
that
jury.
whether
it's
racial
bias
or
it's
bias
because
of
pre-trial
publicity
or
there's
bias
because
people
in
the
jury
know
the
defendant
and
think
he's
a
rascal
or
whatever,
there
is
some
bias
on
that
jury,
and
under
the
harmless
error
doctrine,
you
assume
there's
been
an
impartial
decision-maker
or
the
other
kind
of
jury
error
is
a
non-fact-finding/non-biased
prejudice-kind
of
error
that's,
for
instance,
based
on
a
race,
that
the
court
just
says
and
rightly
so
won't
be
tolerated.
this
court
has
previously
stated
that
it
should
affirm
where
a
finding
of
guilt
is
made
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
that
everyone
is
entitled
to
a
fair
trial
but
not
a
perfect
one.
the
central
purpose
of
the
criminal
trial
is
the
factual
determination
of
guilt,
and
it
was
determined
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
unquestionably
in
this
case.
the
court
has
stated
that
it
shouldn't
reverse
for
inconsequential
errors
because
that
encourages
litigants
to
abuse
the
judicial
process
and
the
public
to
ridicule
it.
that
would
be
the
precise
result
here.
if
there
were
an
initial
preliminary
error
in
the
jury
selection
in
an
otherwise
fair
trial
in
which
the
defendant
is
clearly
guilty,
the
public
would
be
dumbfounded,
i
must
submit,
and
would
only
be
caused
to
disrespect
the
judicial
process.
any
error,
if
it
was
constitutional,
and
we
think
it
was
not,
is
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
didn't
affect
or
abort
the
trial
process.
therefore,
for
those
reasons,
we
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
if
you
have
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
presentation.
