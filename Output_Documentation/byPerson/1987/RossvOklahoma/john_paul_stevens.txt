no,
but
isn't
it
true
that
that
argument
would
apply
no
matter
how
great
the
disproportion
between
the
number
of
preemptories
to
the
defense
and
the
number
for
the
prosecution?
you
could
always
make
that
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
can't
prove
anything
wrong
with
anybody
who
actually
sat.
justice
stevens
if
it's
not
persuasive
in
that
case,
why
is
it
persuasive
in
this
one?
justice
stevens
well,
no.
say
they
had
nine
preemptories
and
the
defense
has
none.
then,
maybe
they
got
a
fair
jury.
it's
perfectly
possible.
you
can
have
a
fair
jury
if
you
just
took
them
out
of
the
hat
by
random.
i
often
think
that
would
be
better
than
having
all
these
complex
procedures
we
have,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
but
the
question
really
is,
is
it
fair
to
tilt
the
scales
just
a
little
bit.
nine
to
eight
isn't
very
serious,
but
why
is
it
different
in
terms
of
what
you
can
actually
prove
than
if
it
was
fourteen
to
seven?
you
never
know
what's
in
a
juror's
mind.
you
presume
they're
all
doing
their
best.
justice
stevens
it's
clear
that
there's
a
difference
in
kind
between
nine
versus
eight
and
eight
versus
eight.
it's
a
difference
in
degree
when
it's
eight
versus
nine
instead
of
eight
versus
ten
or
eight
versus
eleven
or
eight
versus
twelve
because
one
is
equal,
the
other
it
is
unequal.
justice
stevens
to
use
justice
scalia's
example,
we
start
out
each
gets
nine
and
they
just
have
to
use
them
to
correct
judge's
errors,
so
that's
equal.
it
just
happens
the
judge
makes
nine
rather
obvious,
i
don't
want
to
use
the
word
flagrant,
but
clear
errors
that
benefit
the
prosecution,
so
all
nine
of
one
side
have
to
be
used
and
the
other
nine
aren't,
is
it
still
equal?
justice
stevens
so,
you
don't
really
look
at
the
way
it
starts
out
because
it's
true,
as
they
started
out,
they
all
had
nine
and
they
all
were
subject
to
the
problem
they
might
have
to
use
them
to
correct
judge's
errors,
but
you
sort
of
lose
the
equality
if
the
judge's
errors
got
in
one
direction
and
not
the
other.
justice
stevens
we
don't
have
to
presume
bias.
mistakes
just
happen
to
tilt
the
scales
in
that
particular
way.
i
would
assume
the
judge
acted
in
good
faith.
justice
stevens
but,
general
nance,
isn't
the
reason
for
the
rule...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
on
this...
is
that
the
state
wants
to
be
sure
that
the
defendant
is
not
taking
advantage
of
an
objection
that
he
really
wasn't
sincere
about,
that
they
really
wanted
to
be
sure
that
juror
didn't
sit,
and,
so,
they
insisted
that
if
they
want
to
rely
on
the
error
as
a
ground
for
reversal,
that
they
actually
have
exercised
a
preemptory
to
make
sure
it
wasn't
just
an
objection
that
sort
of
pro
forma
to
something
they
really
didn't
care
about?
it
seems
to
me
that
would
make
a
very
sensible
rule,
and
it
wouldn't
create
any
problem
at
all
as
long
as
there
are
plenty
of
preemptories
to
go
around.
the
only
problem
that's
created
is
when
it
does
have
this
unusual
effect,
having
one
side
having
more
than
the
other.
see,
if
you
had
unlimited
preemptories,
then
you
would
certainly
insist
on
that,
then
the
rule
would
solve
the
problem
of
the
sort
of
phony
objection
by
the
trial
court.
