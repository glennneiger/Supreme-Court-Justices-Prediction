justice
scalia
do
they
concede
that
it
was
a
flagrant
error?
i
think
they've
conceded
that
it
was
wrong,
but
i
thought
that,
if
i
recollect
their
brief
correctly,
they
do
make
the
argument
that
there
was
some
ambiguity
in
that
juror's
responses,
that
some
of
his
earlier
responses
were
inconsistent
with
that
statement
that
you
quoted.
justice
scalia
well,
but,
i
understand
that,
but
that's
a
little
different
from
saying
that
it
was
a
flagrant
violation,
so
that
you
can
make
the
statement
that
the
state
must
have
known
there
was
a
violation
and
the
state
could
have
solved
the
problem
by
using
one
of
its
preemptories.
justice
scalia
well,
he
also
said
that
he
couldn't
get
a
fair
jury
in
that
locale
anyway,
hadn't
he?
justice
scalia
right.
so,
i
mean,
there's
no
reason
to
attribute
that
statement
to
the
fact
that...
to
this
one
juror.
he
didn't
think
he
could
get
a
fair
jury
in
this
locale
no
matter
how
many
preemptories
he
had
been
given.
justice
scalia
i
presume
the
same
thing
would
be
true
if
the
judge
wrongfully
excuses
somebody
for
cause
as
opposed
to
wrongfully
not
excusing
for
cause.
i
mean,
you
really
have
to
make
every
call
right
or
you
would
have
affected
the
jury
panel,
and
if
getting
a
jury,
a
different
jury
panel,
although
a
jury
panel
that
is
found
to
be
fully
fair,...
you
have
no
constitutional
claim
this
wasn't
a
fair
panel,
right?
justice
scalia
well,
if
you
could
bring
a
constitutional
claim
that
it
was
not
fair,
that
there
was
someone
there
who
had
a
bias,
who
should
have
been
excused
for
cause,
you'd
have
a
different
case,
wouldn't
you?
justice
scalia
yon
don't
have
that
case.
so,
we
have
to
assume
it
was
a
fair
jury.
you're
saying
any
mistake
that
alters
the
composition
of
the
jury,
but
you
alter
the
composition
of
a
jury
if
you
excuse
somebody
for
cause
erroneously.
right?
justice
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
notion
you've
been
urging,
that
somehow
there
has
to
be
one
expected
jury
and
if
you
don't
get
that,
even
though
there's
no
reason
to
think
it
was
an
unfair
jury,
you've
been
deprived
of
something
of
significance,
is
simply
not
consonant
with
that
notion.
there
are
a
lot
of
different
juries
you
might
have
gotten.
justice
scalia
why
do
you
say
that
there's
no
right
to
not
have
a
juror
excused
for
cause?
do
you
think
that...
don't
you
have
a
right
to
a
panel
fairly
selected
from
the
veneer
that
shows
up?
justice
scalia
you
think
a
judge
can
shave
it
down.
i
bet
you
you'd
be
up
here
in
another
case
if
the
judge
just
arbitrarily
dismissed
nine
of
the
veniremen
just
because
he
didn't
like
them.
justice
scalia
and
a
juror
included
who
might
not
have
been
included.
justice
scalia
and
some
other
juror
excluded
who
might
not
have
been
excluded.
justice
scalia
and
you
would
say
that
they're
not
unequal
because
what
each
side
got
was
nine
preemptories
with
the
understanding
that
they
might
have
to
use
a
certain
number
of
them
to
exclude
jurors
who
were
wrongfully
seated.
justice
scalia
and
the
state
got
the
same
number
on
that
assumption.
justice
scalia
the
state
was
lucky
enough
in
this
trial
not
to
have
to
use
one
of
them
to
exclude
a
jury
that
was
wrongfully
seated,
but
all
it
got
was
nine
minus
whatever
it
would
have
to
use.
justice
scalia
it
depends
upon
what
you
regard
the
state
as
having
given.
i
mean,
why
can't
you
regard
the
state
as
having
said,
look,
it's
often
a
close
call
whether
a
juror
should
be
seated
or
not,
and
we
don't
want
to
ruin
the
trials
with
that,
so
we're
going
to
give
you
many
more
preemptory
challenges
than
we
think
you
need.
but
the
deal
is
you
get
nine
but
both
sides,
we're
treating
you
equally,
you
both
have
to
understand
you
have
to
use
these
when
you
think
the
judge
has
made
a
mistake
in
seating
a
juror.
why
is
that
unfair?
why
is
it
unequal?
justice
scalia
the
state
says
we're
going
to
give
preemptories
only
for
the
purpose
of
challenging
people
who
you
think
were
seated
improperly,
can't
be
used
for
any
other
purpose,
it
can
only
be
used
where
you
believe
the
juror
was
improperly
allowed
on
in
the
face
of
a
for
cause
challenge,
would
that
be
okay?
justice
scalia
but
this
oklahoma
case
law
was
in
effect
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried.
it
was
clear
under
oklahoma
law
that
that's
the
deal.
you
get
nine
and
you
use...
both
sides
use
as
many
of
them
as
you
need
to
remedy
the
errors.
