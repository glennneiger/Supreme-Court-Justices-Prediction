you
keep
emphasizing
the
trial
was
fair.
was
the
refusal
to
exclude
that
juror
because
of
his
statement,
was
that
fair?
i'm
using
your
word,
fair.
justice
marshall
does
an
error
keep
a
trial
from
being
fair?
justice
marshall
he
never
explained
his
reasons.
justice
marshall
so,
how
can
i
assume
that
you
say
what
he
said
when
he
didn't
say
it?
justice
marshall
i
can't
accept
your
reading
of
his
mind.
justice
marshall
where
was
the
trial?
what
city
was
it
in?
justice
marshall
i
know
where
that
is.
justice
marshall
don't
you
agree
that
if
the
judge
had
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
or
some
place
during
the
trial
that
the
defendant
shall
have
eight
challenges
and
the
prosecution
shall
have
nine,
that
that
would
be
error?
justice
marshall
that
would
be
error.
justice
marshall
what's
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one?
justice
marshall
suppose
in
the
first
one,
he
made
a
mistake.
justice
marshall
mistake
in
what
you
said.
i'm
using
your
words.
justice
marshall
error?
justice
marshall
it
would
be
error?
justice
marshall
well,
if
it's
error,
it's
error
here.
