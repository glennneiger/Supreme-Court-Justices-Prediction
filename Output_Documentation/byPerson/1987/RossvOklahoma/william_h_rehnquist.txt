chief

one
reads
the
oklahoma
code
of
criminal
appeals
opinion
and
one
gets
the
impression
that
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
preemptories
in
oklahoma,
is
to
correct
that
sort
of
thing,
that
this
is
not
a
miscarriage
of
the
preemptory
system,
but
it's
one
of
the
things
you
use
it
for.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
are
you
complaining
that
you
had
to
use
the
extra
preemptory
challenges?
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
peterson.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,

chief

rehnquist
one
way
where
this
case
differs
from
gray,
does
it
not,
in
gray,
there
was
a
juror
seated
who
was
subject
to
challenge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.

mr.
peterson,
you

three

remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
peterson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
to
announce.
the
first
is
ross
against
oklahoma,
no.
86-5309.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals.
the
petitioner
here,
a
fellow
named
bobby
lynn
ross,
was
charged
with
capital
murder.
during
voir
dire
in
selecting
his
jury,
a
prospective
juror
named
darrell
huling
indicated
that
if
the
jury
found
ross
guilty,
that
juror
would
automatically
vote
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
the
trial
court
denied
ross'
motion
to
remove
huling
for
cause
and
ross
then
used
his
sixth
peremptory
challenge
to
strike
the
juror.
ross
ultimately
exhausted
all
of
his
peremptory
challenges
provided
under
oklahoma
law.
the
jury
found
him
guilty
and
sentenced
him
to
death.
on
appeal,
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
that
the
trial
court
had
erred
in
denying
the
challenge
to
juror
huling
for
cause,
but
that
court
also
held
that
petitioner
had
established
no
grounds
for
reversal
because
no
objectionable
juror
had
been
seated.
for
the
reasons
explained
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals.
we
agree
that
juror
huling
should
have
been
removed
for
cause,
but
we
think
the
trial
court's
error
did
not
abridge
ross'
sixth
amendment
right
to
an
impartial
juror
because
huling
did
not
sit
and
ross
has
not
shown
that
any
partial
juror
sat
on
the
panel
that
actually
heard
his
case.
the
trial
court's
error
forced
ross
to
exercise
one
of
his
peremptory
challenges
and
may
thereby
have
affected
the
composition
of
the
jury
that
sat.
but
we
reject
the
argument
that
because
of
this
fact,
a
sixth
amendment
violation
occurred.
we
also
reject
the
argument
that
the
trial
court's
error
somehow
deprived
ross
of
due
process.
peremptory
challenges
are
creatures
of
state
law.
they
are
not
mandated
by
the
constitution.
and
under
the
ruling
of
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals,
ross
obtained
all
he
was
entitled
to
under
oklahoma
law.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan,
blackmun
and
stevens
have
joined.
