justice
o'connor
okay.
well,
i
thought
the
state
took
the
position
that
in
view
of
oklahoma's
procedure
of
letting
a
preemptory
be
used
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
failure
to
excuse
the
juror
that,
in
fact,
there
was
no
error
at
the
end
of
the
line.
i
mean,
that
was
what
i
understood
the
argument
to
be.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
the
juror
didn't
sit,
of
course.
