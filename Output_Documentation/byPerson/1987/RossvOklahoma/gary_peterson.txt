mr.
gary
peterson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
oklahoma
has
a
statute
that
grants
a
defendant
in
a
first
degree
murder
case
nine
preemptory
challenges.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
it's
constitutional
for
a
state
to
take
away
one
of
those
preemptory
challenges
during
a
capital
murder
trial.
the
way
that
this
issue
came
up
was
when
the
trial
judge
made
what
everybody
now
agrees
was
a
very
serious
mistake.
during
the
jury
selection
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge
overruled
a
defense
challenge
for
cause
against
a
juror,
mr.
huling,
who
said
that
he
would
return
only
a
death
sentence
upon
conviction
and
that
he
would
not
consider
any
possible
other
penalty.
this
juror
was
plainly
unqualified
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
even
the
state
now
concedes
that
he
was
unqualified
to
sit
on
the
trial.
but
once
the
challenge
for
cause
was
overruled,
there
was
only
one
thing
to
stop
this
juror
from
sitting
on
this
case
and
that
was
if
one
party
or
the
other
removed
him
by
a
preemptory
challenge.
the
way
that
jury
selection
proceeded
in
this
case
was
that
the
parties
used
their
preemptory
challenges
in
alternation.
one
side
would
use
a
challenge,
they
would
bring
on
a
replacement
juror,
and
then
the
other
side
would
use
a
challenge.
the
first
party
to
come
up
with
a
preemptory
challenge
to
use,
after
mr.
huling
was
seated,
was
the
state,
and
what
did
the
state
do
with
its
preemptory
challenge
after
mr.
huling
was
seated?
they
waived
it.
they
didn't
use
it
on
anybody.
they
were
quite
happy
to
see
mr.
huling
sit
as
a
juror
in
this
case.
the
state
apparently
was
not
interested
in
correcting
with
its
own
preemptory
challenges
what
they
now
concede
to
be
a
rather
flagrant
error
by
the
trial
judge.
they
apparently
felt
it
was
the
better
use
of
the
challenge
to
just
waste
it.
mr.
gary
peterson
your
honor,
i
was
relying
on
the
last
oral
argument
in
this
case.
mr.
nance
conceded
that
it
would
violate
the
sixth
amendment
for
this
juror
to
sit.
mr.
gary
peterson
the
state
conceded
it
was
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
we
contend
that
the
sixth
amendment
violation
in
this
case
was
a
flagrant
one.
mr.
gary
peterson
that
was
their
argument,
but
they
did
concede
that
if
this
juror
had
sat,
it
would
have
violated
the
sixth
amendment.
we--
mr.
gary
peterson
--that's
correct,
but
the
cost
of
that
to
the
defense
was
that
it
lost
one
of
its
nine
preemptory
challenges.
the
only
way
to
keep
this
juror
off
was
for
the
defense
to
use
a
preemptory
challenge
of
its
own.
there
was
no
help
coming
from
the
state
to
correct
the
error.
mr.
gary
peterson
the
defense
attorney
did
not
specifically
identify
any
juror
that
actually
sat
on
the
jury
whom
he
would
have
removed.
he
did
specifically
say
that
he
did
not
think
that
the
final
trial
jury
was
fair
and
impartial.
mr.
gary
peterson
he
didn't
have
any
preemptory
challenges
left.
mr.
gary
peterson
he
didn't
say
as
a
hypothetical
matter,
if
i
had
more
preemptory
challenges,
i
would
use
it
upon
juror
x.
of
course,
it's
part
of
our
argument
that
even
if
he
had
made
such
a
statement,
it
wouldn't
have
proved
anything
because
the
mistake
happened
earlier
in
the
jury
selection
and
if
the
mistake
hadn't
happened,
we
could
have
ended
up
with
a
different
panel
of
jurors
facing
him
by
the
end
of
jury
selection.
so
that
it
just
doesn't
prove
anything
and,
of
course,
we're
relying
on
the
gray
v.
mississippi
case
on
that
issue.
mr.
gary
peterson
well,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
argue
that
in
this
case.
of
course,
this
was
a
death
penalty
case,
and
we
would
say
that
in
a
death
penalty
case,
there
should
be
a
very
scrupulous
adherence
to
procedures,
perhaps
more
so
than
in
other
cases.
mr.
gary
peterson
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
state
had
a
rule
that
required
you
to
use
a
preemptory
challenge
in
order
to
correct
the
judge's
error.
if
there
was
no
such
rule,
there
would
be
no
problem.
it
would
just
be
a
tactical
question
about
whether
to
remove
a
juror
or
not
use
a
challenge
and
then
argue
on
appeal
that
the
juror
shouldn't
have
been
seated.
so,
i
think
that
the
constitutional
violation
depends
on
the
defendant
being
forced
to
use
a
preemptory
challenge
to
remove
somebody,
be
forced
to
give
up
a
valuable
right
as
a
result
of
a
mistake.
mr.
gary
peterson
we
disagree.
i
mean,
the
statutes
do
not
say
that.
in
fact,
the
statutes,
oklahoma
statutes,
say
the
direct
opposite
thing.
they
say
preemptory
challenges
are
not
to
be
used
until
people
who
are
challengeable
for
cause
are
removed
from
the
jury.
i
think
the
most
you
can
read
into
the
oklahoma
court
decisions
is
that
they
have
prescribed
some
kind
of
procedure
for
bringing
appeals
on
claims
of
error
based
on
overruling
challenges
for
cause.
they
haven't
said
that
the
right
of
preemptory
challenge
is
extinguished
if
the
judge
happens
to
make
an
error
in
a
case.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
they
seem
to
say
that
the
right
of
preemptory
challenge...
if
the
defendant
had
been
able
to
point
to
somebody
objectionable
or
in
another
case,
they
used
the
expression
unacceptable,
that
was
still
on
the
jury,
they
would
have
a
grant
of
relief.
so,
i
don't
think
they're
saying
that
you
just
have
to
sacrifice
your
preemptory
challenges
for
the
cause
of
justice
in
oklahoma.
i
just
don't
think
that's
the
law
in
oklahoma.
mr.
gary
peterson
we
are
complaining
that
we
had
to
effectively
waste
a
preemptory
challenge
by
using
it
to
excuse
juror
huling.
mr.
gary
peterson
i
think
that
that
puts
a
very
big
burden
on
the
assertion
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
an
impartial
jury
to
have
to
exercise
all
of
your
preemptory
challenges
and
that's
one
of
our
arguments
on
our
sixth
amendment
claim,
is
that
the
state
has
prescribed
procedures
that
are
so
burdensome
to
enforce
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury,
and
one
of
those
rights
is
you
have
to
exhaust
all
your
preemptory
challenges
even
though
there
may
be
a
tactile
reason
to
save
one.
mr.
gary
peterson
i
think
if
you
had--
mr.
gary
peterson
--i
think
if
you
had
a
situation
where
three
were
left,
i
think
you'd
have
a
pretty
good
harmless
error
case.
of
course,
in
this
case,
the
defense
alleges
every
single
one
of
his
preemptory
challenges--
mr.
gary
peterson
--we
don't
know
why
he
exercised
his
preemptory
challenges
the
way
he
did.
in
fact,
our
statute
says
he
doesn't
have
to
state
any
reason
why
he
did
it.
i
think
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
procedure
does
put
a
burden
on
the
enforcement
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
in
this
case.
of
course,
the
case
that
you've
posited
would
be
a
good
case
for
harmless
error.
oklahoma
had
a
procedural
rule,
as
i've
said,
that
required
this
defense
attorney
to
remove
mr.
huling
from
the
jury.
if
he
hadn't
done
that,
he
would
have
been
basically
saddled
with
the
result
of
the
trial.
he
would
have
had
an
unappealable,
uncorrectible
trial
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
claim
on
appeal
that
mr.
huling
should
not
have
sat
on
the
jury.
he
really
had
no
choice
in
this
matter.
he
had
to
use
the
preemptory
challenge
in
order
to
protect
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights
to
a
fair
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment.
once
he
used
the
preemptory
challenge
on
mr.
huling,
he
had
one
less
that
was
available
to
use
on
other
jurors.
this
loss
of
a
preemptory
challenge
violated
the
constitution.
the
oklahoma
court
agreed
that
mr.
huling
should
have
been
removed
by
the
trial
judge
for
cause,
but
they
refused
to
give
any
remedy
for
the
loss
of
the
preemptory
challenge
that
followed
from
following
oklahoma's
procedure.
in
effect,
the
court
said
that
the
loss
of
the
preemptory
challenge
was
a
harmless
error.
we
disagree.
preemptory
challenges
are
valuable
because
they
change
a
jury's
membership,
and
a
change
in
jury's
membership
can
lead
to
a
change
in
the
outcome
of
the
case,
that
could
have
led
to
a
change
in
the
outcome
of
this
case.
there
was
conflicting
evidence
at
the
trial
of
this
case.
for
example,
on
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant
had
the
intent
to
kill.
that
was
an
element
of
the
defense.
there
was
also
conflicting
evidence
on
the
sentencing
issues.
a
different
jury
could
have
resolved
those
conflicts
differently.
this
was
the
kind
of
case
where
the
defense
needed
all
nine
of
its
preemptory
challenges
and
not
just
eight
of
them.
my
client
was
black.
he
was
tried
in
a
virtually
all-white
community
for
the
murder
of
a
white
police
officer.
the
officer
and
his
family
are
residents
of
the
area.
my
client
was
not.
the
trial
judge
specifically
found
that
my
client's
race
was
an
issue
in
the
trial.
the
homicide
had
received
extensive
pre-trial
publicity,
so
much
so
that
the
trial
judge
granted
a
change
of
venue
in
the
case,
but
he
only
moved
the
case
to
the
next
adjoining
county
where
virtually
all
of
the
jurors
that
were
called
for
service
had
read
the
same
pre-trial
publicity
as
in
the
original
county.
it
turned
out
really
not
to
have
been
very
effective
at
all.
there
was
a
very
real
danger
of
prejudice
in
the
community
against
my
client
in
this
case,
and
there
was
a
corresponding
need
for
the
full
complement
of
preemptory
challenges,
all
nine,
to
remove
prejudiced
jurors
from
the
jury.
the
defense
lawyer
in
this
case
unsuccessfully
asked
for
extra
preemptory
challenges
before
trial.
he
used
up
all
the
ones
he
had
during
trial.
although
he
didn't
specifically
challenge
any
of
the
jurors
that
actually
sat
on
the
case
for
cause,
he
did
say
at
the
end
of
jury
selection
that
he
did
not
think
that
the
jury
was
fair
and
impartial.
that's
exactly
the
situation
in
which
preemptory
challenges
are
most
valuable.
when
the
defense
believes
the
jurors
are
not
impartial
and
believes
they
are
biased,
but
he
doesn't
have
the
proof
that's
needed
to
establish
a
challenge
for
cause.
mr.
gary
peterson
that's
what
he
said
in
his
change
of
venue
motion.
mr.
gary
peterson
well,
let
me
back
up.
he
said
he
couldn't
get
a
fair
jury
trial
in
beckham
county,
which
is
where
the
case
was
originally
held.
he
also
said
that
he
didn't
want
the
venue
moved
to
roger
mills
county.
i'm
not
sure
he
ever
said
one
way
or
the
other
whether
he
could
or
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial
in
roger
mills
county.
it's
clear
that
he
didn't
want
the
case
tried
there,
though.
that
was
where
it
ended
up,
though.
preemptory
challenges
are
especially
important
on
the
question
of
punishment
in
oklahoma.
if
even
one
juror
becomes
committed
to
a
life
sentence
during
the
penalty
trial
in
a
death
penalty
case,
the
judge
has
to
discharge
the
jury
and
return
a
life
sentence
in
the
case.
so,
a
change
of
even
one
juror
brought
about
by
a
preemptory
challenge
can
change
the
outcome
of
a
penalty
trial
in
oklahoma
from
death
to
life
and,
of
course,
that
one
juror
could
lead
the
jury
to
a
different
outcome
on
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial
as
well.
mr.
gary
peterson
if
the
defense,
as
in
this
case,
has
used
up
all
of
its
preemptory
challenges,
has
asked
for
more,
has
expressed
a
need
for
every
single
preemptory
challenge
that
they
get
and
they
don't
get
the
full
number,
as
a
result
of
an
error
by
a
government
official,
in
a
death
penalty
case,
in
particular,
yes,
i
think
that
that
would
be
grounds
for
automatic
reversal.
while
a
change
of
even
one
juror
could
have
been
critical,
it's
important
to
note
that
one
preemptory
challenge
could
have
made
more
difference
than
just
one
juror
on
the
final
jury.
when
the
judge
made
his
mistake
in
this
case,
the
parties
between
them
had
a
total
of
eight
preemptory
challenges
left
and
only
eight
of
the
actual
trial
jurors
had
been
seated
at
that
point.
it's
conceivable
that
if
the
judge
had
ruled
differently
on
the
challenge
for
cause,
the
parties
could
have
been
motivated
to
exercise
their
preemptories
differently
in
response.
that's
the
teaching
of
gray
v.
mississippi.
it's
conceivable
that
the
parties
could
have
used
their
eight
remaining
challenges
to
remove
the
eight
actual
jurors
from
the
jury
and
it
could
have
resulted
in
a
completely
different
jury
panel
by
the
end
of
the
trial.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
loss
of
a
preemptory
challenge
was
a
serious
loss.
it
was
one
of
constitutional
dimension.
the
right
to
preemptory
challenge
is,
of
course,
a
state-created
right,
but
it's
nonetheless
an
important
one.
the
court
has
called
it
in
its
own
decisions
one
of
the
most
important
rights
secured
to
the
accused.
it
has
six
and
a
half
centuries
of
history
behind
it.
it's
recognized
in
every
single
state
and
federal
jurisdiction
as
an
essential
part
of
jury
trial.
when
a
preemptory
challenge
is
taken
away,
as
here,
it's
a
significant
loss.
it's
like
the
loss
of
another
kind
of
state-created
right
that
the
court
considered
in
evvits
v.
lucey,
rights
to
an
appeal.
even
though
it's
created
by
the
state,
an
appeal
can't
be
taken
away
after
it's
given
without
denying
due
process
of
law.
the
loss
of
a
preemptory
challenge
is
the
same
kind
of
grievous
loss
that
brings
the
due
process
clause
into
play.
the
decision
of
this
court
that
comes
closest
to
the
situation
here
is
hicks
v.
oklahoma.
that
case
involved
another
state-created
right,
the
right
to
jury
sentencing.
the
defendant
in
the
hicks
case
had
a
right
under
state
law,
not
under
the
constitution,
to
be
sentenced
by
a
jury.
although
there's
no
constitutional
right
to
be
sentenced
by
a
jury,
the
court
still
held
the
denial
of
the
state-created
right
to
jury
sentencing
denied
due
process
of
law.
the
right
to
jury
sentencing
in
hicks
was
important
because
the
jury
could
return
a
different
sentence
than
a
judge
could
return.
the
right
to
preemptory
challenge
is
important
because
one
jury
can
return
a
different
verdict
than
another
jury,
and
a
preemptory
challenge
is
the
tool,
is
the
instrument
that
brings
about
a
change
of
one
jury
into
a
different
jury.
the
right
to
preemptory
challenge
should
be
treated
in
the
same
way
as
the
right
to
jury
sentencing
in
hicks.
if
it's
taken
away
by
mistake,
by
a
government
official,
then
there
has
been
a
serious
deprivation,
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
gary
peterson
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
fair
or
not.
all
we
know
is
that
a
defense
lawyer
didn't
think
it
was
fair
because
that's
what
he
said.
mr.
gary
peterson
we
don't
have
the
proof
that
this
court
would
require.
mr.
gary
peterson
i
disagree.
the
right...
you
don't
have
any
right
to
have
people...
there's
no
corresponding
right...
there's
no
inverse
preemptory
challenge.
there's
no
right
to
have
people
that
you
want
to
have
on
the
jury
on
the
jury.
there
is
no
right
personal
the
defendant
can
assert.
since
there's
been
no
invasion
of
a
right,
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
insist
that
somebody
stay
on
the
jury.
i
don't
think
that
an
erroneous
ruling
on
excluding
a
person
from
a
jury,
unless
it
offended
witherspoon
or
some
of
these
other
cases,
would
create
a
constitutional
problem
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
gary
peterson
the
whole
purpose
of
a
preemptory
challenge
is
for
the
defense
to
remove
people
that
it
thinks
are
bias
from
the
jury
when
it
doesn't
have
the
proof
to
sustain
a
challenge
for
cause.
the
fact
that
we
don't
have
the
proof
i
don't
think
really
answers
the
question
of
whether
it
was
important
or
not
to
deny
a
preemptory
challenge.
here,
the
defense
lawyer
wanted
preemptory
challenges.
there
was
a
background
of
prejudice,
potential
prejudice,
against
my
client
in
the
community.
he
used
up
every
one
he
had.
he
asked
for
more
and
couldn't
get
them.
i
think
it
was
a
serious
loss
in
this
case,
and
the
cases
that
you
perhaps
hypothesize
wouldn't
create
the
same
situation.
mr.
gary
peterson
i
know
of
no
right
in
the
constitution
or
any
statute
in
oklahoma
that
says
that--
mr.
gary
peterson
--there's
no
statute
in
oklahoma
that
gives
the
defendant
the
right
to
insist
that
somebody
stay
on
the
jury.
there
has
been
no
violation
of
any
state-created
right
that
would
create
a
due
process
clause
problem.
the
state
here
really
has
two
arguments
why
the
due
process
clause
was
violated.
one
is
that
you're
not
really
entitled
to
nine
preemptory
challenges
under
oklahoma
law.
you're
really
only
entitled
to
nine
preemptory
challenges
less
however
many
mistakes
a
judge
makes
in
the
case.
if
you
have
a
real
top-notch
trial
judge
that
rules
right
on
challenges
for
cause,
you're
entitled
to
nine.
if
you
have
maybe
a
more
mistaken-prone
trial
judge,
you're
entitled
to
eight
or
six
or
zero
or
whatever
the
judge
decides
to
give
you.
mr.
gary
peterson
they
can
be.
mr.
gary
peterson
certainly
in--
mr.
gary
peterson
--in
a
death
case,
if
the
state
has
a
rule
requiring
the
defense
to
use
preemptory
challenges
to
correct
the
trial
judge's
error,
and
if
the
defense
has
manifested
in
some
way
that
they
need
the
preemptory
challenge,
if
it's
clear
that
it's
not
a
harmless
error,
yes,
in
that
case,
there
should
be
an
automatic
reversal.
there's
been
a
loss
of
a
very
serious
right
in
that
situation,
and
there's
no
way
to
say
it's
harmless.
the
problem
with
the
state's
argument
about
the
defendant
really
isn't
entitled
to
nine
preemptory
challenges
is
unsupported
by
our
statutes.
the
statutes
just
do
not
say
that.
they
say
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
nine
and
they
don't
put
any
conditions
on
it.
the
case
law
doesn't
say
that
the
right
to
preemptory
challenge
is
extinguished
by
a
trial
judge's
error
either.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
they
said
that
the
defendant's...
they
certainly
didn't
say
it
in
this
case.
in
fact,
they
seem
to
suggest
if
the
defendant
had
followed
a
little
different
procedure,
one
that
we
say
has
no
meaning
under
gray
v.
mississippi,
they
would
have
granted
the
reversal
in
this
case.
so,
the
defense
doesn't
have
to
sacrifice
its
preemptory
challenges
in
order
to
correct
the
trial
judge's
error.
the
state
is
wrong
when
it
says
that
you're
entitled
to
something
less
than
nine
preemptory
challenges
under
oklahoma
law.
the
state's
other
argument
is
that
even
if
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
nine
preemptory
challenges,
a
trial
with
eight
preemptory
challenges
doesn't
deny
what
they
call
fundamental
fairness.
the
state
hasn't
been
too
clear
on
what...
how
you
judge
what
is
or
isn't
fundamentally
fair.
certainly
it
doesn't
seem
fair
for
my
client
to
be
getting
eight
preemptory
challenges
in
his
case
while
other
first
degree
murder
defendants
in
oklahoma
are
getting
nine.
presumably,
the
statutes
of
oklahoma
are
some
evidence
of
what
the
people
of
oklahoma
speaking
through
their
legislature
regard
as
fundamentally
fair,
and
those
statutes
say
that
the
fair
number
is
nine,
not
eight.
mr.
gary
peterson
they
used
five
and
waived
four.
mr.
gary
peterson
effectively,
yes.
mr.
gary
peterson
effectively,
yes.
of
course,
the
state
had
the
opportunity
to
use
all
nine
and
that
may
have
influenced
how
the
defense
used
theirs.
but
instead
of
focusing
on
fundamental
fairness,
a
more
appropriate
inquiry,
we
submit,
is
whether
the
defendant
received
the
process
that
he
was
due
under
the
law.
since
that's
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
says,
this
court
has
said
that
the
law
in
due
process
of
law
includes
state
law.
just
like
the
law
in
this
case,
that
require
nine
preemptory
challenges.
the
defendant
was
due
nine
preemptory
challenges
under
oklahoma's
law.
he
only
received
eight
of
them.
if
he
is
imprisoned
and
executed
as
a
result
of
a
trial
which
he
receives
only
nine...
eight
of
his
nine
challenges,
the
state
has
deprived
him
of
his
life
and
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
and
that
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
on
the
question
of
harmless
error,
chapman
v.
california
says
that
proving
a
constitutional
error
is
harmless
as
the
burden
that's
on
the
beneficiary
there,
which
is
the
state
in
this
case.
it
also
says
that
the
burden
is
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
don't
have
any
burden
of
proof
on
this
issue,
but
the
record
gives
every
indication
that
the
error
was,
in
fact,
a
harmful
one
and
not
a
harmless
one.
to
establish
harmless
error,
there's
no
dispute
that
if
the
defendant
had
had
another
preemptory
challenge,
he
could
have
used
it
to
alter
the
membership
of
the
jury.
to
establish
harmless
error
in
this
kind
of
situation,
they
would
either
have
to
show
one
of
two
things.
one,
that
a
different
jury
would
have
decided
the
case
in
the
same
way,
or,
two,
that
even
if
the
defendant
had
had
the
full
use
of
all
nine
of
his
preemptory
challenges,
he
wouldn't
have
used
them
in
a
way
that
would
have
changed
the
jury's
membership.
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
state
to
establish
either
of
those
propositions
in
this
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
on
the
question
of
whether
a
different
jury
would
have
decided
the
case
in
the
same
way,
this
court's
harmless
error
decisions
in
jury
selection
cases
going
back
a
hundred
years
have
never
tried
to
go
back
and
figure
out
what
a
different
jury
would
have
done
in
a
case,
but
for
a
constitutional
error
in
jury
selection.
it
would
be
unprecedented
for
the
court
to
start
doing
that
now.
but
even
if
it
did,
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
in
conflict.
for
example,
on
the
question
of
intent
to
kill.
a
different
jury
could
have
reached
a
different
result.
on
the
question
of
whether
additional
preemptories
would
have
been
used,
if
it
had
been
available
by
the
defense
attorney,
the
record
shows
that
he
asked
for
additional
preemptories
before
trial
and
was
denied
them.
he
used
up
all
the
preemptories
he
had
during
trial.
in
view
of
the
fact
he
told
the
trial
judge
that
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
twelve
actually-impanelled
juries,
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
if
he
had
had
the
full
use
of
his
nine
preemptory
challenges,
he
would
have
used
the
one
that
had
to
be
used
on
mr.
huling
against
another
juror
and
by
doing
that,
he
would
have
changed
the
jury's
membership.
there
were
only
two
things
that
he
didn't
do.
he
didn't
ask
for
more
preemptory
challenges
after
the
judge
made
his
mistake.
that
would
have
been
futile.
under
oklahoma
law,
the
judge
couldn't
increase
the
number
of
preemptory
challenges
for
the
party.
the
other
thing
he
didn't
do
was
to
say
as
a
hypothetical
question
that
he
would
have
exercised
a
challenge
if
he
had
another
one
available
against
some
juror
that
actually
sat
on
the
panel.
but
that's
the
same
kind
of
statement
by
counsel
that
the
court
considered
in
gray
v.
mississippi,
and
the
court
said
in
that
case
that
it
had
no
probative
value
as
to
whether
an
error
was
harmful
or
harmless.
the
error
in
this
case
occurred
in
the
sixth
round.
that
was
when
the
judge
made
his
mistake.
if
the
judge
had
ruled
differently
in
the
sixth
round,
there
could
have
been
an
entirely
different
panel
by
the
time
the
ninth
round
came
around.
so,
what
counsel
did
or
didn't
say
about
the
panel
that
was
left
after
the
ninth
round
doesn't
prove
one
way
or
the
other
what
would
or
wouldn't
have
happened
if
the
judge
hadn't
made
his
mistake
in
the
sixth
round.
the
state
cannot
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
constitutional
error
in
this
case
was
harmless.
we
ask
that
the
judgement
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
oklahoma
be
reversed,
and
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gary
peterson
what
the
state
says,
in
essence,
is
that
the
right
to
preemptory
challenge
in
oklahoma
is
conditioned
by
the
state's
right
to
arbitrarily
take
those
challenges
away
as
a
result
of
mistakes.
even
if
that
were
the
rule,
it
wouldn't
be
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
state
may
not
have
to
give
these
challenges
in
the
first
place,
but
once
it
does,
it
can't
just
take
them
away
as
a
result
of
mistakes
by
government
officials.
it
has
to
comply
with
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
gary
peterson
they
don't
have
to
give
the
right
in
the
first
place,
but
when
they
do,
i
think
it's
just
a
constraint
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it's
like
the
right
of
appeal.
you
may
not
need
it
in
eighty
percent
of
the
cases,
but
if
they
just
take
it
away
arbitrarily,
as
a
mistake,
it's
still
a
serious
loss.
mr.
gary
peterson
no.
the
state
doesn't
have
to
give
these
preemptory
challenges,
but
once
it
does,
it
has
to
not
take
them
away
as
a
result
of
mistakes
and
when
it
does,
it's
violated
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
gary
peterson
correct.
mr.
gary
peterson
if
the
state
had
had
to
remove
the
juror
in
this
case?
mr.
gary
peterson
oh,
i
see.
mr.
gary
peterson
well,
the
due
process
clause
doesn't
protect
the
state,
it
protects
individuals.
mr.
gary
peterson
no.
mr.
gary
peterson
i
think
if
they
defined
that
rule
in
advance
to
where
the
defense
knows
about
it
before
the
trial
begins,
and
it's
fair
to
both
sides,
then
that
would
be
a
legitimate
limitation.
mr.
gary
peterson
you
didn't
know
when
the
jury
selection
began
whether
the
judge
was
going
to
make
a
mistake
or
not,
and
i
think
that's
the
difference.
you
can't
know
how
to
exercise
your
preemptory
challenges
correctly
and
effectively
unless
you
know
whether
the
judge
is
going
to
make
a
mistake.
he
isn't
going
to
come
in
and
say,
counsel,
i'm
going
to
make
three
mistakes
during
this
jury
selection
and
you
can
plan
out
your
strategies
accordingly.
that
didn't
happen
and
because
it
didn't,
the
defense
couldn't
use
its
preemptories
effectively
and
it
did
violate
the
due
process
clause.
