justice
white
the
state
is
subject
to
the
same
rules.
if
it
wants
to
get
a
juror
off
the
panel
the
judge
seated,
they
have
to
exercise
it.
maybe...
what
if
the
state
has
exercised
the
preemptory
to
get
such
a
juror
off
in
this
case,
would
you
be
here?
justice
white
my
question
again.
the
defendant
in
this
case
exercised
the
preemptory
challenge
to
get
off
a
wrongfully-seated
juror,
is
that
right?
justice
white
now,
what
if
in
the
same
case,
the
state
had
had
to
do
the
same
thing,
would
you
be
here?
justice
white
no,
no.
just
another
juror.
justice
white
they
both
started
out
with
nine
and
they
both
ended
up
with
eight,
according
to
you.
justice
white
well,
i
still
ask
you.
would
you
be
here?
