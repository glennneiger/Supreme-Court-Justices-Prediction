justice
kennedy
just
before
we
leave
the
question
about
the
juror,
this
doesn't
come
up
to
us
on
habeas.
there
was
no
findings.
there
were
no
findings
that
a
particular
juror
would
have
been
challenged?
justice
kennedy
but
he
didn't
say
that
as
to
any
particular
juror
he
would
have
exercised
his
last
preemptory
challenge?
justice
kennedy
or
that
he
would
have
exercised
an
additional
preemptory
challenge?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
are
going
somewhat
beyond
that,
aren't
you?
aren't
you
saying
that
if
any
juror
is
wrongfully
excluded...
wrongfully
included,
calling
for
a
preemptory
challenge
that
you
have
automatically
as
a
lawyer?
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
judge
just
makes
an
error
and
seats
a
juror
that
he
shouldn't,
and
you
use
one
preemptory
challenge
extra,
automatic
reversal?
justice
kennedy
but
are
you
complaining
that
you
had
to
use
all
of
your
preemptory
challenges
in
order
to
make...
bring
this
appeal?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
you
had
four
and
you
only
lost
one,
and
you
only
had
to
use
one
improperly,
then
you're
not
hurt
if
you
had
three
extra
ones
that
you
more
or
less
had
to
burn,
shall
we
say,
simply
in
order
to
take
an
appeal.
justice
kennedy
i
don't
see
where
the
harm
is.
justice
kennedy
but
you
are
saying
that
you're
concerned
that
he
was
forced
to
do
this
in
order
to
appeal,
and
i'm
saying
he
either
used
them
properly
or
he
didn't
need
them.
justice
kennedy
so,
you're
saying
that
any
time
a
preemptory
challenge
is
improperly
required
of
the
attorney,
because
of
for
cause
challenges,
improperly-denied,
automatic
reversal?
justice
kennedy
well,
a
lot
of
cause
challenges
are
pretty
close
calls,
aren't
they?
justice
kennedy
and
in
your...
still
under
your
view,
any
error
for
cause
challenge
requires
reversal?
justice
kennedy
where
a
preemptory
challenge
is
used.
justice
kennedy
did
the
state
use
its
nine?
justice
kennedy
so,
then,
it
used
five
and
you
had
eight.
justice
kennedy
without
including
the
one
you
had
to
use
improperly.
justice
kennedy
well,
does
any
state
give
more
preemptory
challenges
to
the
prosecution
than
to
the
defense?
justice
kennedy
i
believe
some
states
give
more
to
the
defense
than
to
the
prosecution.
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
a
state
gave
the
prosecution
twice
as
many
preemptories
as
to
the
defense,
violation
there?
constitutional
problem?
justice
kennedy
so,
a
misallocation
or
a
disproportionate
grant
of
preemptory
challenges
can
give
rise
to
a
constitutional
problem,
then
it's
just
a
question
of
degree,
correct?
justice
kennedy
and
here
you
say
that
one
more
preemptory
challenge
does
not
rise
to
the
degree
of
the
constitutional
violation?
justice
kennedy
of
course,
in
fairness,
gray
v.
mississippi
points
in
that
direction.
i
recognize
you
can
distinguish
it
factually,
but
isn't
the
teaching
of
that
case
that
we're
just
not
going
to
speculate
about
what
another
jury
would
have
been
like?
justice
kennedy
in
gray,
a
woman
was
excluded.
a
juror
was
excluded
who
should
have
been
included.
justice
kennedy
here,
there
was
a
juror
who
was
excluded
who
should
have
been
excluded,
but
under
the
wrong
challenge.
