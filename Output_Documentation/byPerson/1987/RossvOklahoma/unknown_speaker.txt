unknown
speaker
do
they
concede
that
it
was
a
flagrant
error?
i
think
they've
conceded
that
it
was
wrong,
but
i
thought
that,
if
i
recollect
their
brief
correctly,
they
do
make
the
argument
that
there
was
some
ambiguity
in
that
juror's
responses,
that
some
of
his
earlier
responses
were
inconsistent
with
that
statement
that
you
quoted.
unknown
speaker
well,
but,
i
understand
that,
but
that's
a
little
different
from
saying
that
it
was
a
flagrant
violation,
so
that
you
can
make
the
statement
that
the
state
must
have
known
there
was
a
violation
and
the
state
could
have
solved
the
problem
by
using
one
of
its
preemptories.
unknown
speaker
okay.
well,
i
thought
the
state
took
the
position
that
in
view
of
oklahoma's
procedure
of
letting
a
preemptory
be
used
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
failure
to
excuse
the
juror
that,
in
fact,
there
was
no
error
at
the
end
of
the
line.
i
mean,
that
was
what
i
understood
the
argument
to
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
juror
didn't
sit,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
just
before
we
leave
the
question
about
the
juror,
this
doesn't
come
up
to
us
on
habeas.
there
was
no
findings.
there
were
no
findings
that
a
particular
juror
would
have
been
challenged?
unknown
speaker
but
he
didn't
say
that
as
to
any
particular
juror
he
would
have
exercised
his
last
preemptory
challenge?
unknown
speaker
or
that
he
would
have
exercised
an
additional
preemptory
challenge?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
going
somewhat
beyond
that,
aren't
you?
aren't
you
saying
that
if
any
juror
is
wrongfully
excluded...
wrongfully
included,
calling
for
a
preemptory
challenge
that
you
have
automatically
as
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
judge
just
makes
an
error
and
seats
a
juror
that
he
shouldn't,
and
you
use
one
preemptory
challenge
extra,
automatic
reversal?
unknown
speaker
one
reads
the
oklahoma
code
of
criminal
appeals
opinion
and
one
gets
the
impression
that
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
preemptories
in
oklahoma,
is
to
correct
that
sort
of
thing,
that
this
is
not
a
miscarriage
of
the
preemptory
system,
but
it's
one
of
the
things
you
use
it
for.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
complaining
that
you
had
to
use
the
extra
preemptory
challenges?
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
complaining
that
you
had
to
use
all
of
your
preemptory
challenges
in
order
to
make...
bring
this
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
had
four
and
you
only
lost
one,
and
you
only
had
to
use
one
improperly,
then
you're
not
hurt
if
you
had
three
extra
ones
that
you
more
or
less
had
to
burn,
shall
we
say,
simply
in
order
to
take
an
appeal.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
where
the
harm
is.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
saying
that
you're
concerned
that
he
was
forced
to
do
this
in
order
to
appeal,
and
i'm
saying
he
either
used
them
properly
or
he
didn't
need
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
also
said
that
he
couldn't
get
a
fair
jury
in
that
locale
anyway,
hadn't
he?
unknown
speaker
right.
so,
i
mean,
there's
no
reason
to
attribute
that
statement
to
the
fact
that...
to
this
one
juror.
he
didn't
think
he
could
get
a
fair
jury
in
this
locale
no
matter
how
many
preemptories
he
had
been
given.
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
saying
that
any
time
a
preemptory
challenge
is
improperly
required
of
the
attorney,
because
of
for
cause
challenges,
improperly-denied,
automatic
reversal?
unknown
speaker
i
presume
the
same
thing
would
be
true
if
the
judge
wrongfully
excuses
somebody
for
cause
as
opposed
to
wrongfully
not
excusing
for
cause.
i
mean,
you
really
have
to
make
every
call
right
or
you
would
have
affected
the
jury
panel,
and
if
getting
a
jury,
a
different
jury
panel,
although
a
jury
panel
that
is
found
to
be
fully
fair,...
you
have
no
constitutional
claim
this
wasn't
a
fair
panel,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
could
bring
a
constitutional
claim
that
it
was
not
fair,
that
there
was
someone
there
who
had
a
bias,
who
should
have
been
excused
for
cause,
you'd
have
a
different
case,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
yon
don't
have
that
case.
so,
we
have
to
assume
it
was
a
fair
jury.
you're
saying
any
mistake
that
alters
the
composition
of
the
jury,
but
you
alter
the
composition
of
a
jury
if
you
excuse
somebody
for
cause
erroneously.
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
notion
you've
been
urging,
that
somehow
there
has
to
be
one
expected
jury
and
if
you
don't
get
that,
even
though
there's
no
reason
to
think
it
was
an
unfair
jury,
you've
been
deprived
of
something
of
significance,
is
simply
not
consonant
with
that
notion.
there
are
a
lot
of
different
juries
you
might
have
gotten.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
that
there's
no
right
to
not
have
a
juror
excused
for
cause?
do
you
think
that...
don't
you
have
a
right
to
a
panel
fairly
selected
from
the
veneer
that
shows
up?
unknown
speaker
you
think
a
judge
can
shave
it
down.
i
bet
you
you'd
be
up
here
in
another
case
if
the
judge
just
arbitrarily
dismissed
nine
of
the
veniremen
just
because
he
didn't
like
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
lot
of
cause
challenges
are
pretty
close
calls,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
and
in
your...
still
under
your
view,
any
error
for
cause
challenge
requires
reversal?
unknown
speaker
where
a
preemptory
challenge
is
used.
unknown
speaker
did
the
state
use
its
nine?
unknown
speaker
so,
then,
it
used
five
and
you
had
eight.
unknown
speaker
without
including
the
one
you
had
to
use
improperly.
unknown
speaker
you
keep
emphasizing
the
trial
was
fair.
was
the
refusal
to
exclude
that
juror
because
of
his
statement,
was
that
fair?
i'm
using
your
word,
fair.
unknown
speaker
does
an
error
keep
a
trial
from
being
fair?
unknown
speaker
he
never
explained
his
reasons.
unknown
speaker
so,
how
can
i
assume
that
you
say
what
he
said
when
he
didn't
say
it?
unknown
speaker
i
can't
accept
your
reading
of
his
mind.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
any
state
give
more
preemptory
challenges
to
the
prosecution
than
to
the
defense?
unknown
speaker
i
believe
some
states
give
more
to
the
defense
than
to
the
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
a
state
gave
the
prosecution
twice
as
many
preemptories
as
to
the
defense,
violation
there?
constitutional
problem?
unknown
speaker
so,
a
misallocation
or
a
disproportionate
grant
of
preemptory
challenges
can
give
rise
to
a
constitutional
problem,
then
it's
just
a
question
of
degree,
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
here
you
say
that
one
more
preemptory
challenge
does
not
rise
to
the
degree
of
the
constitutional
violation?
unknown
speaker
where
was
the
trial?
what
city
was
it
in?
unknown
speaker
i
know
where
that
is.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
fairness,
gray
v.
mississippi
points
in
that
direction.
i
recognize
you
can
distinguish
it
factually,
but
isn't
the
teaching
of
that
case
that
we're
just
not
going
to
speculate
about
what
another
jury
would
have
been
like?
unknown
speaker
one
way
where
this
case
differs
from
gray,
does
it
not,
in
gray,
there
was
a
juror
seated
who
was
subject
to
challenge?
unknown
speaker
in
gray,
a
woman
was
excluded.
a
juror
was
excluded
who
should
have
been
included.
unknown
speaker
here,
there
was
a
juror
who
was
excluded
who
should
have
been
excluded,
but
under
the
wrong
challenge.
unknown
speaker
and
a
juror
included
who
might
not
have
been
included.
unknown
speaker
and
some
other
juror
excluded
who
might
not
have
been
excluded.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
isn't
it
true
that
that
argument
would
apply
no
matter
how
great
the
disproportion
between
the
number
of
preemptories
to
the
defense
and
the
number
for
the
prosecution?
you
could
always
make
that
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
can't
prove
anything
wrong
with
anybody
who
actually
sat.
unknown
speaker
if
it's
not
persuasive
in
that
case,
why
is
it
persuasive
in
this
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
no.
say
they
had
nine
preemptories
and
the
defense
has
none.
then,
maybe
they
got
a
fair
jury.
it's
perfectly
possible.
you
can
have
a
fair
jury
if
you
just
took
them
out
of
the
hat
by
random.
i
often
think
that
would
be
better
than
having
all
these
complex
procedures
we
have,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
but
the
question
really
is,
is
it
fair
to
tilt
the
scales
just
a
little
bit.
nine
to
eight
isn't
very
serious,
but
why
is
it
different
in
terms
of
what
you
can
actually
prove
than
if
it
was
fourteen
to
seven?
you
never
know
what's
in
a
juror's
mind.
you
presume
they're
all
doing
their
best.
unknown
speaker
it's
clear
that
there's
a
difference
in
kind
between
nine
versus
eight
and
eight
versus
eight.
it's
a
difference
in
degree
when
it's
eight
versus
nine
instead
of
eight
versus
ten
or
eight
versus
eleven
or
eight
versus
twelve
because
one
is
equal,
the
other
it
is
unequal.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
say
that
they're
not
unequal
because
what
each
side
got
was
nine
preemptories
with
the
understanding
that
they
might
have
to
use
a
certain
number
of
them
to
exclude
jurors
who
were
wrongfully
seated.
unknown
speaker
and
the
state
got
the
same
number
on
that
assumption.
unknown
speaker
the
state
was
lucky
enough
in
this
trial
not
to
have
to
use
one
of
them
to
exclude
a
jury
that
was
wrongfully
seated,
but
all
it
got
was
nine
minus
whatever
it
would
have
to
use.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
agree
that
if
the
judge
had
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
or
some
place
during
the
trial
that
the
defendant
shall
have
eight
challenges
and
the
prosecution
shall
have
nine,
that
that
would
be
error?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
error.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one?
unknown
speaker
suppose
in
the
first
one,
he
made
a
mistake.
unknown
speaker
mistake
in
what
you
said.
i'm
using
your
words.
unknown
speaker
error?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
error?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
error,
it's
error
here.
unknown
speaker
to
use
justice
scalia's
example,
we
start
out
each
gets
nine
and
they
just
have
to
use
them
to
correct
judge's
errors,
so
that's
equal.
it
just
happens
the
judge
makes
nine
rather
obvious,
i
don't
want
to
use
the
word
flagrant,
but
clear
errors
that
benefit
the
prosecution,
so
all
nine
of
one
side
have
to
be
used
and
the
other
nine
aren't,
is
it
still
equal?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
don't
really
look
at
the
way
it
starts
out
because
it's
true,
as
they
started
out,
they
all
had
nine
and
they
all
were
subject
to
the
problem
they
might
have
to
use
them
to
correct
judge's
errors,
but
you
sort
of
lose
the
equality
if
the
judge's
errors
got
in
one
direction
and
not
the
other.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
have
to
presume
bias.
mistakes
just
happen
to
tilt
the
scales
in
that
particular
way.
i
would
assume
the
judge
acted
in
good
faith.
unknown
speaker
but,
general
nance,
isn't
the
reason
for
the
rule...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
on
this...
is
that
the
state
wants
to
be
sure
that
the
defendant
is
not
taking
advantage
of
an
objection
that
he
really
wasn't
sincere
about,
that
they
really
wanted
to
be
sure
that
juror
didn't
sit,
and,
so,
they
insisted
that
if
they
want
to
rely
on
the
error
as
a
ground
for
reversal,
that
they
actually
have
exercised
a
preemptory
to
make
sure
it
wasn't
just
an
objection
that
sort
of
pro
forma
to
something
they
really
didn't
care
about?
it
seems
to
me
that
would
make
a
very
sensible
rule,
and
it
wouldn't
create
any
problem
at
all
as
long
as
there
are
plenty
of
preemptories
to
go
around.
the
only
problem
that's
created
is
when
it
does
have
this
unusual
effect,
having
one
side
having
more
than
the
other.
see,
if
you
had
unlimited
preemptories,
then
you
would
certainly
insist
on
that,
then
the
rule
would
solve
the
problem
of
the
sort
of
phony
objection
by
the
trial
court.
unknown
speaker
it
depends
upon
what
you
regard
the
state
as
having
given.
i
mean,
why
can't
you
regard
the
state
as
having
said,
look,
it's
often
a
close
call
whether
a
juror
should
be
seated
or
not,
and
we
don't
want
to
ruin
the
trials
with
that,
so
we're
going
to
give
you
many
more
preemptory
challenges
than
we
think
you
need.
but
the
deal
is
you
get
nine
but
both
sides,
we're
treating
you
equally,
you
both
have
to
understand
you
have
to
use
these
when
you
think
the
judge
has
made
a
mistake
in
seating
a
juror.
why
is
that
unfair?
why
is
it
unequal?
unknown
speaker
the
state
is
subject
to
the
same
rules.
if
it
wants
to
get
a
juror
off
the
panel
the
judge
seated,
they
have
to
exercise
it.
maybe...
what
if
the
state
has
exercised
the
preemptory
to
get
such
a
juror
off
in
this
case,
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
my
question
again.
the
defendant
in
this
case
exercised
the
preemptory
challenge
to
get
off
a
wrongfully-seated
juror,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
if
in
the
same
case,
the
state
had
had
to
do
the
same
thing,
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
just
another
juror.
unknown
speaker
they
both
started
out
with
nine
and
they
both
ended
up
with
eight,
according
to
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
still
ask
you.
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
the
state
says
we're
going
to
give
preemptories
only
for
the
purpose
of
challenging
people
who
you
think
were
seated
improperly,
can't
be
used
for
any
other
purpose,
it
can
only
be
used
where
you
believe
the
juror
was
improperly
allowed
on
in
the
face
of
a
for
cause
challenge,
would
that
be
okay?
unknown
speaker
but
this
oklahoma
case
law
was
in
effect
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried.
it
was
clear
under
oklahoma
law
that
that's
the
deal.
you
get
nine
and
you
use...
both
sides
use
as
many
of
them
as
you
need
to
remedy
the
errors.
