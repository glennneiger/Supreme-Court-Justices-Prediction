mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
that
is
our
position,
and
it
is
our
position
for
all
of
our
clients,
including
mr.
james,
who
is
not
under
indictment.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
i
speak
for
all
of
our
clients
in
this
court
and
below,
and
we
said
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
in
essence
what
has
occurred
here
is,
events
have
overtaken
the
need
for
injunctive
relief.
there
is
an
indictment.
there
are
motions
pending.
one
motion
has
already
been
granted.
our
fourth
amendment
claim
with
respect
to
lawyer-client
privilege
has
been
vindicated
in
the
superior
court
in
bridgeton,
new
jersey,
by
judge
serata.
indeed--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--it
relates
to
some
of
the
materials,
and
there
is
a
motion
pending
with
respect
to
our
other
fourth
amendment
claims
as
well.
we
had
a
forum,
at
the
time
there
was
an
indictment,
we
had
a
forum
for
those
claims.
we
raised
those
claims
in
the
new
jersey
forum.
indeed,
the
court
has
disposed
very
early
on
of
the
lawyer-client
privilege
document
and
returned
certain
documents
to
us
as
a
result
of
our
fourth
amendment
claims,
and
has
under
consideration
today,
and
has
a
motion
before
him
today
with
respect
to
other
of
our
fourth
amendment--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--it
has
not
been
argued,
your
honor.
we
have
asked
for
an
october
31st
date.
we
are
trying
to
move
that
along
because...
for
practical
reasons.
we
have
clients
who
have
essentially
been
put
out
of
business
by
the
pendency
of
the
indictment,
so
we
are
making
efforts
to
move
that
along.
we
made
the
motion
and
we
believe
it
will
be
heard,
if
it
is
not
october
31st
of
this
year,
it
will
be
shortly
thereafter.
well,
i
take
it
the
answer
to
the
mootness
argument
is
that
this
case
isn't
moot
because
the
entire
case
should
have
been
dismissed
by
the
district
judge.
we
are
prepared
to
argue
that.
we
are
prepared
to
support
the
majority
of
the
third
circuit.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
that
was
the
issue
when
we
were
seeking
injunctive
relief,
because
it
is
the
injunctive--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--i
understand
that,
but
it
should
have
been
dismissed
because
of
the
alleged
intrusion
on
the
investigative
process
by
our
seeking
injunctive
relief,
not
by
our
seeking
damages,
and
what
they
argue,
that
since
we
sought
injunctive
relief,
our
claim
not
only
for
injunctive
relief
but
for
damages
should
be
dismissed--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--and
that
still
is
the
claim,
but
we
are
not
making
it--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--but
we
are
not
seeking,
we
are
no
longer
seeking
the
injunctive
relief.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
yes,
we
are.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
yes,
justice,
we
are.
we
are
seeking
to
stay
in
court,
and
we
are
seeking
to
stay
in
the
federal
court
on
the
damage
issue
albeit
stayed,
and
we
have
agreed
to
the
stay.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
that's
correct.
that's
exactly
what
this--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--well,
you
have
an
issue
under
younger,
but
what
we
say
is
essentially
it
is
a
moot
issue
because
the
reason
that
younger
would
be
applicable,
or
the
reason
it
was
argued
that
younger
was
applicable
to
us
below
is
that
we
were
seeking
certain
injunctive
relief
which
we
are
no
longer
seeking.
that
didn't
happen--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--they
have
argued
that,
justice.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
well,
with
respect
to
that,
i
would
say
where
is
the
intrusion,
where
is
the
necessity...
where
to
comity
principles
come
into
play
so
as
to
deprive
us
of
what
the
congress...
deprived
our
clients
of
what
the
congress
has
given
them,
that
is,
a
right
to
go
into
the
federal
court
with
a
1983
lawsuit.
the
congress
passed
the
law
and
said
that
essentially
under
the
jurisdiction
section,
that
we
have
the
right
to
original
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts.
it
is
defeated...
that
is
a
right
that
was
given
to
us.
it
is
defeated
only
if
by
our
bringing
that
particular
action
we
are
now
going
to
impose
ourselves
in
a
way
that
would
violate
the
federalism
principle
on
the
state
process,
that
is,
the
investigative
process,
the
grand
jury
process,
or
some
other
state
process.
in
this
case
it
would
be
investigative
and
grand
jury.
what
we
say
is,
at
that
stage
we
were
seeking
certain
injunctive
relief
which
they
could
argue
would
impose
upon
that
particular
state
those
particular
state
processes.
we
say
that
is
no
longer
the
case.
that
happened,
unfortunately,
about
ten
or
fifteen
days
after
the
circuit
court
decided
this
case.
so
that
what
we
argue
at
this
stage
with
respect
to
mootness,
justice,
is
that
there
is
no
longer
any
reason
for
the
federal
court
to
abstain
from
a
case
which
is
validly
before
it
based
on
comity
principles
and
based
on
federalism
principles.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
yes,
we
believe
the
rule
under...
we
believe
that
younger
allows,
obviously,
and
mandates
abstention
under
certain
circumstances,
and
what
are
the
circumstances?
it
was
essentially
a
three-pronged
test.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
well
we
say
that
only
on
the
injunctive
claim.
we
say
if
we
brought
a
damage
suit
only
originally
in
the
federal
court
there
would
be
no
basis
for
younger
abstention.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
yes.
we
think
there
would
be
an
argument.
at
that
point
in
time,
chief
justice,
we
may
very
well
have
argued
against
it,
but
today
we
will
not
argue
against
it,
and
i
believe
our
briefs
have
indicated
that.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
whether
they
stay
it
or
dismiss
it?
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
yes.
i
think
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference,
because
as
has
been
pointed
out
here
we
have
statute
of
limitation
problems
in
the
event
it
is
not.
i
mean,
there
is
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations.
the
two
years
is
long
past.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
that
is
only
partially
so,
justice,
because--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--justice,
you
see,
our
case
goes
far
beyond
our
fourth
amendment
claims.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
and
what
we
say
is,
we
now
have
a
forum
for
fourth
amendment
claims.
where
is
our
forum,
justice,
where
is
our
forum
for
our
claim
of
deprivation
of
liberty?
where
is
our
forum
for
our
fifth
amendment
claims?
where
is
the
forum
for
our
claim
in
our
complaint
that
we
were
deprived
of
our
property,
at
least
on
a
temporary
basis?
those
are
all
claims
that
cannot
be
litigated
in
the
present
criminal
proceeding
in
new
jersey.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
no,
they
were
not.
just
the
fourth
amendment
claim,
your
honor,
was
embraced
in
the
injunctive
request,
is
my
recollection.
so
that
the
injunctive
request
really
only
went
to
part
of
our
case,
and
what
we
argue
to
this
court
is
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
federal
forum
on
damages
because
that
is
all
that
is
left
in
this
case.
had
the
situation
been
as
it
is
today,
we
would
have
never
moved
for
injunctive
relief.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
because
it
wasn't
necessary.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
your
honor,
we
believe
that
would
dispose
of
the--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--as
a
litigant,
no.
as
a
lawyer,
obviously,
i
do.
but
our
litigants
do
not
have
an
interest
in
that,
because
they
do
not
seek--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--that's
correct.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
that's
correct.
indeed,
the
dissent
at
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
dissent
only
with
respect
to--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--we
will
take
either
of
the
opinions
at
the
third
circuit
at
this
stage.
i
must
say
we
argued
at
the
third
circuit--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--the
litigants
do
not
care.
it
is
of
no
moment
to
any
litigant
in
this
case
that
injunctive
relief
would
be
available.
they
are
not
looking
for
it
and
don't
want
it.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
well,
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
we
allege
that
the
investigation
as
carried
out
by
the
individual
defendant
petitioners
in
this
case
was
conduct
which
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
respondent.
we
allege
that.
and
in
doing
so
we
did
not
ask
to
enjoin
the
prosecution,
and
today
we
do
not
ask
to
enjoin
even
those
acts.
we
ask
that
the
case
go
forward
with
respect
to
damages.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
no,
we
do
not.
we
have
another
part
of
our
fourth
amendment
claim
pending.
if
your
honor
please,
let
me
explain
that
to
you.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
part
is
decided,
part
is
before
the
court,
and
part--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--see,
we
don't
have--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--you
see,
your
honor,
we
don't
have
a
fourth
amendment
claim
for
damages
per
se.
what
we
have
alleged
in
our
complaint
is
that
there
are
a
host
of
constitutional
violations
which
were
caused
by
an
improper
effort
by
the
state
to
coerce
several
of
the
clients
to
give
testimony
against
other
individuals
in
cape
may
county.
our
fourth
amendment
claim
is
really
threefold.
one,
it
had
to
do
with
return
of
documents
that
were
subject
to
lawyer-client
privilege.
it
had
to
do
with
the
return
of
documents
that
were
outside
the
scope
of
the
warrant.
and
it
had
to
do
with
the
officers
going...
the
way
they
conducted
the
search,
the
way
they
went
out
into
the
yard
of
this
particular
area
and
looked
at
the
serial
numbers,
for
instance,
on
all
of
the
construction
equipment
that
was
there,
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
what
the
warrant
was
issued
for.
it
was
simply
an
effort
to
find
out
really--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--they
were
indicted
for
conspiracy,
a
bribery
case
essentially,
conspiracy
and
bribery.
it
had
nothing
to
do
at
all
with
the
equipment.
the
effort
was
to
see
if
they
could
pick
up
a
serial
number
off
the
piece
of
equipment
that
was
stolen
or
some
problem
with
it
so
that
they
could
then
come
in
and
use
that
to
browbeat
them
to
give
testimony
against
other
people
who
they
wished
to
indict.
that
was
the
effort
we
allege...
that
we
have
no...
we
have
no
forum
for
that;
even
today,
because
it
doesn't
challenge
the
warrant.
the
warrant
didn't
say
that
they
could
go
out
in
the
yard
and
look
at
the
equipment
in
the
yard.
the
magistrate,
the
judge
who
issued
the
warrant,
he
didn't
say
they
could
do
that.
they
took
that
upon
themselves.
the
magistrate
or
the
judge
in
this
case
who
issued
the
warrant
did
not
say,
listen,
fellows,
go
in
there
with
a
blank
subpoena
and
if
you
see
something
that
you
want,
we
will
have
an
attorney
sign
the
subpoena
in
blank,
and
if
you
see
something
that
isn't
under
the
warrant
but
you
want
to
pick
it
up
later,
fill
out
this
grand
jury
subpoena
and
hand
it
to
him,
which
is
what
we
allege
in
our
complaint
occurred.
they
stacked
up
all
these
documents
that
weren't...
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
warrant,
sat
down
with
their
blank
subpoena,
and
issued
a
blank
subpoena.
we
can't
challenge
the
warrant
on
that
basis
because
the
judge
didn't
authorize
that
type
of--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--we
can
raise
them
only
insofar
as
they
affect
documents
that
are
presently
in
the
possession
of
the
state
or
those
that
would
be
offered,
say,
in
evidence,
those
that
are
evidence
against
us.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
correct,
your
honor.
yes,
justice,
we
could.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
but
there
won't
be.
you
see--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--two
defendants,
two
at
one
company.
one
company,
one
partnership,
and
one
individual.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
three.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
three,
but
one
individual,
one
partnership,
and
one
company.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
now,
if...
at
different
times
in
the
progeny
of
younger
the
court
has
looked
at
what
facts
should
we
look
at
in
determining
whether
or
not
younqer
should
apply.
for
instance,
in
middlesex
county,
the
belated
effort
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
to
provide
that
petitioner
a
remedy
for
his
constitutional
claims
was
considered
even
though
that
didn't
occur
until
after
the
third
circuit's
decision.
in
the
hicks
case
there
was
an
indictment
that
was
considered.
what
we
argue
to
this
court
is,
we
are
prepared
to
analyze
this
case
at
any
stage
and
argue
to
the
court
that
there
was
never
an
ongoing
state
proceeding
which
was
an
adequate
forum
for
all
of
the
relevant
issues
which
we
raised
in
the
district
court,
and
that
is
because
there
was
never
a
forum
even
today
that
would
allow
us
to
raise
those
constitutional
claims
except
for
some
of
the
constitutional
claims
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
no,
there
are
other
claims
which...
there
are
other
claims...
i
am
sorry.
i
missed
part
of
your
question.
are
you
saying
to
me
that--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--no,
we
did
not.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
we
did
not,
and
there
is
a
state
forum.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
in
all
honesty
i
must
say
that
we
could
file
the
exact
pleading
in
the
state
court,
but
the
congress
allowed
us
to
file
it
in
the
federal
court,
and
we
chose
to
do
it.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
so
there
is
a
forum.
the
question,
as
i--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--yes.
yes.
correct.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
on
all
of
them,
even
the
one
aspect
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
we
can't
raise
as
a
damage
claim.
it
is
not
an
injunctive
claim.
we
have
no
injunctive
claims
any
longer.
the
injunctive
claims
were
mooted
by
what
occurred.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
yes,
we
could
have.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
yes,
justice,
we
had
an
option.
we
believe
the
congress
gave
us
that
option.
we
selected
the
federal
court.
and
we
believe
that
in
applying
younger
this
court
ought
to
respect,
and
we
argue
to
you
you
should
respect
our
choice
of
forum,
unless
what
we
are
doing
is
so
offensive
to
the
principles
of
comity--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--i
would
argue
yes,
and
i
also
know
i
would
be
in
a
lot
of
trouble
in
this
court
in
arguing
yes,
but
i
would
argue
to
you
yes,
but
the
fact
is
that--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--that
is
not
our
case.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
in
the
real
world,
that
there
is
any
chance
that
that
could
happen,
especially
given
the
calendars,
what
they
are
in
new
jersey
today.
we
would
never
get
a
decision.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
i
am
sorry,
you
lost
me.
or
maybe
i
lost
myself.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
can
understand
it
makes
it
a
much
closer--
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
--most
doubtful
that
that
could
happen,
but
let
me
get
back
to
the
earlier
point,
justice,
which
you
made.
if
that
were
the
only
case,
that
is,
our
fourth
amendment
claims
that
we
now
have
pending
in
new
jersey,
that
would
make
this
case
a
closer
case.
that
would
make
it
a
much
closer
case
respecting
whether
there
ought
to
be
younger
abstention,
because
obviously
the
state
provided
us
a
forum.
it
did
it
in
a
way
that
we
didn't
appreciate.
that
was
through
an
indictment.
but
we
have
a
forum
to
test
it
except
for
damages.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
goes
far
beyond
anything
which
we
are
now
or
can
litigate
in
the
state
court.
it
goes
to
violations
of...
1983
violations
far
beyond
those
aspects
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
that
is
why
we
most
respectfully
argue
to
this
court,
you
must
look
at
our
entire
case.
look
at
and
find
out
whether
or
not
there
was
an
ongoing
state
proceeding
at
any
stage
which
could
have
allowed
us
to
litigate
those
claims,
the
claims
of
deprivation
of
liberty,
the
claims
of
deprivation
of
property,
having
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
matters
under
which
our
clients
are
indicted.
indeed,
i
say
to
you,
whether
or
not
our
clients
are
convicted
is
irrelevant
to
that
lawsuit
because
either
the
state
officers
on
october
5th,
1984,
when
they
went
there,
they
either
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
our
clients
or
not,
and
even
if
they
were
guilty
of
something,
even
if
they
were
guilty
of
something,
they
were
entitled
not
to
have
their
rights
violated,
and
we
allege
they
were
violated
in
more
ways
that
merely
the
seizing
of
the
documents
which
are
now
being
challenged
pursuant
to
our
fourth
amendment
motions
in
the
state
court.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
that
is
most
unusual.
if
we
were
to
file
a
state
case
it
would
be
in
cape
may
county,
and
judge
lenox
is
in
trenton.
it
happens
because
judge
lenox
is
the
assignment
judge
in
trenton.
the
state
grand
jury
sits
in
trenton,
and
judge
lenox
has
been
assigned
to
supervise
the
procedure
of
the
state
grand
jury.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
no,
but
he
also
had
a
second
role.
it
happened
that
he
was
the
issuing
magistrate
for
the
warrant
as
well,
but
the
state
could
have
gone
to
any
judge.
indeed,
municipal
magistrates
are
available,
and
others.
in
this
case
they
chose,
because
they
regularly
take
their
business
to
that
court...
it
just
happens
it
is
across
the
street,
so
that
is
why
they
go
there.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
it
is
because...
frankly,
i
arrived
on
the
scene
on
october
5th
and
got
judge
lenox
on
the
phone,
and
i
was
the
lawyer
who
complained
that
we
weren't
getting
a
receipt
for
these
documents,
so
when
judge
lenox
said
that,
he
said,
seal
them
all,
and
he
put
them
under
seal.
the
federal
case...
you
have
to
understand
the
chronology.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
he
was
the
issuing
magistrate
or
the
issuing
judge,
but
the
chronology
is
important,
justice.
this
case
was
started
before
the
state
filed
an
ex
parte
order
to
show
cause.
there
was
no
proceeding
pending.
there
was
no
state
proceeding
pending
when
this
complaint
was
filed,
so
if
this
court
were
to
look
at
where
we
were
on
december
27th,
1984,
when
this
complaint
was
filed,
there
were
no
state
proceedings
pending.
the
state
proceeding
came,
and
i
wrote
it
down,
but
it
is
some
time
in
february
or
march
of
1985,
by
virtue
of
an
order
to
show
cause
that
the
state
brought.
they
brought
it,
and
then,
of
course,
let
that
order
to
show
cause
sit
there.
we
argue
to
you
reason
tells
us
that
they
did
that
so
that
they
could
have
created
a
proceeding
that
they
could
go
to
the
federal
court
and
say,
oh,
look,
there
is
a
proceeding
in
new
jersey
on
some
of
these
same
matters,
so
you
ought
to
throw
these
plaintiffs
out
of
the
federal
district
court
because
they,
despite
the
urging
of
judqe
lenox,
for
over
a
year
they
did
absolutely
nothing
with
the
order
to
show
cause.
nothing
occurred.
it
just
sat
there.
and
then
when
something
happened
we
wrote
to
judge
lenox,
and
judge
lenox
said
this
case
is
deemed
withdrawn
because
of
this
hiatus
and
this
inaction.
so
that
while
they
were
bound
and
determined
to
get
this
order
to
show
cause,
certainly
the
state
showed
not
so
great
diligence
on
following
up
on
the
order
to
show
cause,
although
they
obviously
pointed
to
it
at
every
stage
in
the
federal
proceeding.
finally,
justices,
let
me
say
that
the
potomac
case,
the
potomac
electric
company
case,
juxtaposed
to
our
case,
i
think
amply
demonstrates
what
the
true
differences
are.
in
that
case
the
plaintiff
sought
to
have
declared
unconstitutional
the
underlying
statutes
with
which
they
were
threatened
an
indictment,
and
they
sought
to
have...
essentially
affect
the
investigation
by
having
the
statute
it
was
based
on
declared
unconstitutional.
not
so
here.
in
our
case
we
did
not
do
that,
and
that
is
the
difference,
because
if
there
was
an...
if
you
consider
the
grand
jury
to
be
an
ongoing
state
proceeding,
we
would
argue
to
the
court
that
it
is
not
an
ongoing
state
judicial
proceeding,
and
that
there
is
no
certainty
that
potomac
electric
would
have
forgotten
to
argue
its
case.
indeed,
since
there
was
no
indictment,
what
we
argue
indeed
came
true
in
potomac
electric.
they
never
got
to
be
able
to
argue
the
constitutionality
of
the
ongoing
statute
because
there
was
no
indictment,
but
in
our
case
that
is
not
what
occurred.
we
are
not
challenging
that.
we
are
not
challenging
any
statute,
and
therefore
we
are
in
a
different
position.
we
are
in
a
position
where
there
is
absolutely
no
adequate
forum
in
the
state
court
by
virtue
of
an
ongoing
proceeding
even
if
there
is
an
indictment.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
i
am
satisfied
and
i
will
go
home,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
n.
fitzpatrick
it
is
over
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
justice
marshall.
thank
you.
