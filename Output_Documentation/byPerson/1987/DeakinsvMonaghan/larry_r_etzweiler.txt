mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
are
here
today
asking
this
court
to
overturn
a
decision
which
threatens
grave
interference
with
state
grand
jury
proceedings.
it
is
our
concern
that
the
lower
court's
opinion
will
encourage
disgruntled
subjects
of
state
grand
jury
investigations
to
file
1983
suits
in
the
hopes
that
they
can
sidetrack
the
state
grand
jury
process
or
obtain
discovery
under
liberal
civil
discovery
standards
which
are
not
available
in
the
criminal
context.
i
will
briefly
summarize
the
facts.
petitioners
in
this
case
are
all
state
law
enforcement
officers
who
have
been
sued
in
a
1983
action
requesting
both
injunctive
relief
and
money
damages.
the
petitioners
executed
a
search
warrant
issued
by
judge
lenox,
an
assignment
judge
in
new
jersey
who
supervises
the
state
grand
jury.
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
search
warrant
there
was
a
dispute.
the
plaintiffs
claimed
that
the
state
was
not
leaving
an
adequate
inventory
to
explain
what
had
been
taken.
and
the
plaintiffs
accordingly
telephoned
judge
lenox
and
obtained
from
judge
lenox
an
order
that
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
being
taken
should
be
sealed
in
evidence
boxes
pending
judicial
resolution
of
the
inventory
problem.
also
at
the
time
of
the
execution
the
state
issued
three
state
grand
jury
subpoenas
upon
the
plaintiffs,
two
of
which
the
plaintiffs
complied
with,
and
a
third
of
which
and
also
a
fourth
subpoena
which
was
issued
later,
the
plaintiffs
successfully
moved
to
quash,
again
before
judge
lenox.
at
a
later
date
in
an
attempt
to
resolve
the
inventory
dispute
the
plaintiffs
came
to
the
division
of
criminal
justice
in
trenton,
went
through
the
evidence
with
a
court
reporter
to
take
an
inventory,
and
in
the
process
of
doing
this
came
upon
evidence
which
the
plaintiffs
claim
was
being
retained
illegally
by
the
state
in
that
their
fourth
amendment
or
attorney-client
privileges
or
work
product
privileges
were
being
violated,
and
accordingly,
in
view
of
their
complaint,
the
state
again
resealed
this
evidence,
not
the
entirety
of
it
but
just
three
boxes
of
it
pending
judicial
resolution
of
this
question
which
the
state
sought
by
an
order
to
show
cause
again
before
judge
lenox
compelling
the
plaintiff
to
explain
why
this
resealed
evidence
should
not
be
unsealed.
at
that
proceeding
the
plaintiffs
relied
upon
attorney
client
and
work
product
privileges.
the
plaintiffs
filed
suit.
they
did
so
after
the
motion
to
quash
and
after
the
first
partial
unsealing
but
before
the
show
cause
order.
the
district
court
in
viewing
these
proceedings
concluded
that
with
respect
to
the
equity
portion
of
the
lawsuit,
that
is,
with
respect
to
the
plaintiff's
claim
for
an
injunction
for
the
return
of
property,
that
these
proceedings
showed
that
the
younger
abstention
doctrine
should
apply,
and
accordingly
the
district
court
dismissed
the
equity
portion.
with
respect
to
the
damages
portion,
the
court
concluded
that
the
pendency
of
the
damages
action
would
substantially
impede
the
state's
criminal
investigation,
and
it
also
dismissed
this
portion
of
the
suit.
the
plaintiffs
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
third
circuit
in
viewing
these
proceedings
concluded
that
the
district
court
erred,
concluding
that
these
proceedings
were
not
adequate
to
invoke
the
younger
abstention
doctrine,
and
remanded
the
matter
to
the
district
court
for
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
plaintiffs'
request
for
injunctive
relief.
with
respect
to
the
damages
portion,
the
third
circuit
concluded
that
even
if
the
younger
abstention
were
applicable,
the
district
court
would
have
no
discretion
to
dismiss
and
it
would
only
be
allowed
to
stay
the
damages
claim
pending
the
younger
absention
proceedings.
we
submit
that
the
third
circuit
erred--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--i
wasn't
initially
intending
to,
but
i
will
be
happy
to
entertain
questions
on
that
question.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
with
respect
to
the
damages
claim?
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
well,
we
are
arguing
both
that
the
district
court
has
discretion
to
dismiss
the
damage
claim
and
also
that
the
district
court
was
correct
with
respect
to
the
younger
proceedings
on
the
injunctive
claim.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
they
have
agreed
that
they
would
amend
the
complaint.
they
haven't
yet
done
that.
also,
one
of
the
points
is,
there
is
currently
allegations
of
criminal
conduct
which
has
resulted
in
the
issuing
of
state
grand
jury
proceedings
again
with
respect
to
these
plaintiffs.
i
guess
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
this
issue
can
come
up
again
before
them.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
involving
the
same
parties,
yes.
let
me
see.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
well,
that...
i
can't--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--there
is
an
ongoing
criminal
investigation
going
on.
subpoenas
have
been
issued.
i,
of
course,
am
not
at
liberty
to
divulge
what
has
happened
in
the
course
of
the
state
grand
jury
proceedings,
but--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--what
they
have
said
is
that
if
this
court
will
dismiss
the
claim
as
moot,
we
will...
if
this
court
will
dismiss
the
petition
as
moot,
we
will
amend
the
complaint
to
delete
our
request
for
injunctive
damages.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
there
is
another
factor,
and
that
is
that
not
all
the
plaintiffs
have
been
indicted.
the
issue
still
remains
in
live
controversy,
for
example,
with
respect
to
mr.
james,
who
hasn't,
as
i
understand
it,
agreed
to
dismiss
this
claim
with
prejudice.
he
could
come
back
later
on
the
same
claim.
also,
this
type
of
question--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--yes,
he
is,
your
honor,
he
is
one
of
the
respondents,
and
he
is
also
a
party
who
has
not
been
indicted.
not
all
the
plaintiffs
have
been
indicted.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
i
think
they
have
agreed
to
amend
their
complaint
if
this
court
will
dismiss
the
case
as--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--i
don't
know
if
they
have
agreed
to
do
so
dispositively
on
the
merits
and
not
come
back
into
court
and
petition--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--well,
they
are
not
quite
all
in
the
same
position
in
that
only
some
of
them
have
been
indicted
and
some
have
not.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
they
are
not
quite
in
the
same
boat
because
the
plaintiffs
who
have
been
indicted
would
of
necessity
resolve
their
fourth
amendment
claims,
i
presume,
in
the
course
of
the
state
criminal
litigation.
that
is
not
necessarily
true
with
respect
to
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--they
have
offered
that,
yes.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
that
is
the
offer
which
they
have
made,
yes.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
no,
we
seek
a
reinsertion
of
the
district
court
opinion.
we
don't
want
the
damages
action--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--that's
correct.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
well,
the
pendency
of
the
damages
action
has
a
chilling
effect.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
psychologically
it
does.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
well,
but
these
are
very
important
for
the
states--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--yes,
i
know,
but
this
is
an
important
factor
under
the
younger
comity
considerations.
even
the
pendency
of
this
action
is
going
to,
for
example,
make
it
hard
for
our
investigators
to
apply
for
credit
when
they
apply
for
mortgages
and
their
mortgage
companies
get
nervous.
is
stands
as
a
sword
over
them
that
makes
them
less
enthusiastic
about
proceeding
with
the
criminal
matter.
it
makes
other
investigators
shy
about
becoming
involved
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
this
is
why
the--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
if
they
lose
in
the--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--yes.
of
course,
it
would
be
preferable
if
they
would
take
all
of
these
claims
into
the
state
system
where
a
single
judge
could--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--i
agree.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
it
very
well
may
be.
it
is
not
a
consideration
which
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
in
this
instance.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
i
think
that
is
probably
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
that's
correct,
but
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
stay
or
dismiss,
another
reason
we
think
that
the
district
court
should
have
discretion
in
these
matters
is
that
plaintiffs
whose
desire
is
to
impede
the
grad
jury
investigation
are
going
to
have
an
incentive
to
attach
damage
claims
to
equity
actions
when
they
file
1983
lawsuits.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
we
are
arguing
that
the
district
court
has
discretion,
yes.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
we
would
submit
that
it
would,
but
of
course
our
case
is
much
easier,
because
we
have
got
the--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--he
would
have--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--well,
because
we
don't
view
the
dismissal
again
as
a
dismissal
on
the
merits.
we
don't
have...
we
would
submit
that
he
would
have
the
discretion.
of
course,
in
the
absence
of
a
claim
for--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--we
would
submit
that,
but
that
it
not--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
well,
he
can
do
it
under
the
comity
considerations
which
underlie
the
younger
abstention
doctrine,
underlie,
for
example,
this
court's
opinion
in
fair
assessment
versus
mcnulty
on
the
theory
that
the
pendency
even
of
the
stayed
damages
action
is
going
to
have
a
chilling
effect
upon
these
investigators
as
they
attempt
to
pursue
the
criminal
prosecution,
and
also
for
policy--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--we
also
have
in
this
case
other
facets
which
supported
the
district
court's
discretion
in
this
matter,
and
that's
the
many
questions
of
state
law
that
were
very
much
entwined...
intertwined
with
the
federal
claims.
for
example,
part
of
the
federal
claim
here
is
that--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--they
may
be
resolved.
they
won't
necessarily
be
resolved
with
respect
to
the
parties
who
aren't
in
the
state
criminal--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
going
back
to
the...
with
respect
to
the
third
circuit's
opinion
again,
which
had
covered
not
only
the
damages
action
but
also,
of
course,
the
request
for
injunctive
relief,
it
is
our
posture
that
the
third
circuit's
opinion
will
enable
subjects
of
grand
jury
investigations
to
chill
investigations,
to
use
discovery
that
they
cannot
obtain
in
the
course
of
the
criminal
investigation,
and
also
will
result
in
dual
litigation,
enmeshing
both
the
federal
court
and
the
state
court
in
supervising
the
state
grand
jury
procedures
which
are
contrary
to
our
system
of
federalism
and
the
comity
principles
that
lie
at
the
basis
of
younger.
perhaps
i
could
talk
a
bit
about
the
discovery
question.
even
with
respect
to
the...
with
the
injunctive
portion
of
this
suit,
the
plaintiffs
would
also
have
access
to
discovery.
in
this
instance,
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
suit,
with
that
filing
they
served
a
request
for
deposition
and
for
the
production
of
documents.
among
the
documents
which
they
wanted
were
documents
which
divulge
what
the
instructions
our
investigators
had
been
given
before
they
went
to
execute
the
search
warrant.
it
is
apparent
that
that
type
of
information
could
divulge
or
might
divulge
to
the
plaintiffs
the
theory
of
the
state's
case.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
yes,
your
honor,
but
of
course
the...
ascertaining
whether
the
protective
order
is
appropriate
may
very
well
require
the
federal
judge
to
look
into
the
grand
jury
investigation
to
ascertain
what
information
should
be
privileged,
what
information
should
not
be
privileged.
it
might
require
the
federal
judge
to
pull
in
the
prosecutor,
to
ask
him
what
is
happening
in
the
course
of
this
criminal
investigation.
essentially
it
requires
the
federal
judge
or
may
require
the
federal
judge
to
supervise
the
grand
jury
process
just...
or
as
the
state
judge
should
be
doing.
we
submit
that
this
is
contrary
to
our
notions
of
federalism.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
we
would
be
protected,
but
the
rule
allowing
a
permanent
stay
is
not
necessarily
a
good
rule
for
this
court
to
adopt
as
national
policy.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
well,
it
is
still
going...
it
would
not
protect
our
investigators
as
they
go
out
and
apply
for
mortgages
as
they
have
the--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--yes,
it
would
protect
us
from
that.
it
would
not--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--right.
it
would
not
offer
us
the
full
protection
which--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--or
a
judgment
of
dismissal
not
on
the
merits.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
but
the
pending
litigation
will
not
be
hanging
over
these...
the
subjects
of
the
investigation.
also,
if
these
plaintiffs,
it
would
be
preferable
if
these
plaintiffs
would
pursue
all
their
claims
in
the
state
court
system
where
they
have
remedies,
including
1983
remedies,
because
in
a
coordinated
system
we
can
then
have
a
state
judge
ascertaining,
for
example,
from
his
review
of
the
grand
jury
process,
whether
limited
aspects
of
discovery
could
go
forward
whether
limited
aspects
of
the
damages
action
could
go
forward.
it
is
possible
that
through
limited
proceedings,
for
example,
the
damages
action
could
be
determined
to
be
subject
to
dismissal
under
the
harlow
versus
fitzgerald
standard.
that
would
certainly
be
preferable
to
these
plaintiffs
other
than
letting
this
action
hang
completely
in
the
federal
court
pending
the
younger
abstention
proceedings.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
there
very
well
may
be,
yes.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
i
think
mr.
justice--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--we
oppose...
we
submit
that
the
matter
should
be
in
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
because...
essentially
for
three
reasons.
the
younger
opinion
will
be
intimidating,
the
continuation
of
the
damages
action
will
be
intimidating
investigators.
if
the
stay
is
not
mandatory,
these
plaintiffs
will
be
continually
coming
back,
asking
for
a
lifting
of
the
stay,
which
will
involve
the
federal
judge
in
looking
into
the
grand
jury
process.
we
don't
want
to
encourage
plaintiffs
who
are
simply
seeking
to
hinder
the
process
of
the
grand
jury
investigation
to
join
a
damages
action
along
with
their
injunctive
claim,
and
we
think
that
this
is
consistent
with
the
younger
doctrine,
somewhat
responding
to
justice
scalia's
question
in
that
younger
was
concerned
about
federal
processes
which
would
enmesh
the
federal
district
court
in
disrupting
or
having
a
negative
impact
upon
matters
of
importance
in
state
proceedings.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
a
rule
which
would
always
mandate
that
stay
would
again...
i
guess
there's
two
possibilities
with
the
stay.
number
one,
it
is
subject
to
being
lifted.
or,
number
two,
it
is
not
subject
to
being
lifted.
neither
of
those
possibilities
is
necessarily
good.
subject
to
being
lifted,
of
course,
upon
the
plaintiff's
contention
that
the
grand
jury
proceedings
are
not
going
expeditiously,
then
you've
got
the
federal
judge
intervening.
if
it
is
not
subject
to
being
lifted,
then
a
preferable
rule
would
be
for
the
states
to
take
the
matter
over
so
that
it
can
ascertain
whether
the
damages
action
can
continue
without
interference
upon
the
grand
jury
process.
may
i
reserve--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--an
indictment
was
returned.
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
with
respect
to
this--
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
--the
indictment?
it
is
still
in
pretrial
proceedings.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
my
understanding
is
that
the
plaintiffs
have
not
yet
filed
such
a
motion.
but
i
got
that
from
the
last
time
i
talked
with
the
attorney
who
is
prosecuting
the
matter.
i
presume
they
still
will
file
such
a
motion.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
there
may
be.
my
understanding...
i
can't
answer
that
question.
there
is,
of
course,
a
time
limit,
but
often
judges
extend
the
time
limit,
especially
in
very
complex
cases
such
as
this.
thank
you.
mr.
larry
r.
etzweiler
with
respect
to
the
mootness
question,
and
it
is
particularly
with
respect
to
the
mootness
of
the
question
whether
state
grand
jury
proceedings
are
judicial
proceedings
for
the
purposes
of
the
younger
abstention
doctrine,
this
is
certainly
a
case
which
is
capable
of
repetition
but
evasive
of
review.
this
court
has
before
it
two
cases,
the
pepco
versus
sachs
case
out
of
the
fourth
circuit,
it
has
this
case
out
of
the
third
circuit
holding
directly
conflicting
theories.
in
the
pepco
case
the
grand
jury
chose
not
to
return
an
indictment.
in
this
case
the
grand
jury
chose
to
return
an
indictment.
it
is
very
likely
every
time
this
issue
arises
in
the
third
circuit
by
the
time
it
gets
to
this
court,
even
in
a
very
complex
case
as
of
this
nature
in
which
the
grand
jury
pleadings
were
extensive,
one
status
or
the
other
is
going
to
arise.
therefore,
it
would
be
a
basis
of
review...
evasive
of
review.
it
is
certainly
capable
of
repetition
in
this
case
because
there
are
grand
jury
proceedings
outstanding
with
respect
to
the
plaintiffs
because
these
plaintiffs
may
again
have
a
search
warrant
or
other
proceedings
in
the
course
of
those
grand
jury
proceedings
because
these
plaintiffs
have
agreed
to
abandon
their
injunctive
claim
with
respect
to
this
indictment
but
they
haven't
agreed
to
abandon
these
claims
with
respect
to
any
future
criminal
proceedings
which
may
ensue
and
which
currently
are
under
investigation.
also,
what
we
are
reviewing
here
is
the
propriety
of
the
district
court
opinion
in
which
a
dismissal
was
entered.
that
dismissal
was
premised
in
part
upon
the
facts
as
existed
at
the
time
it
entered
its
judgment,
and
it
was
premised
in
part
upon
its
conclusion
that
younger
applied
by
virtue
of
the
ongoing
grand
jury
proceedings.
to
review
that
judgment
and
to
review
whether
that
dismissal
was
proper
requires
an
adjudication
of
the
first
question
which
we
have
raised,
that
is,
whether
the
grand
jury
proceedings
are
state
proceedings
for
purposes
of
the
younger
abstention
doctrine.
that
is
with
respect
to
mootness.
with
respect
to
when
the
state
proceedings
were
started
and
with
respect
to
part
of
what
my
opponent
here
was
saying
in
his
argument,
we
submit
that
the
proceedings,
the
state
proceedings
were
started
first
of
all
with
mr.
fitzpatrick's
telephone
call
to
judge
lenox
seeking
the
sealing
order.
they
may
have
been
started
earlier
with
the
judge's
issuing
of
a
search
warrant.
in
our
last
brief
filed
in
this
matter
we
made
some
comparison.
a
search
warrant
is
very
much
like
an
ex
parte
writ
of
attachment.
state
officials
go
to
a
judge.
they
submit
an
affidavit.
they
get
an
order
which
is
called
a
search
warrant.
that
allows
them
to
go
and
take
property,
and
to
retain
that
property
until
such
time
as
the
plaintiffs
come
into
court
in
new
jersey
under
a
rule
357
motion
explaining
why
the
state
should
not
retain
that
property.
that
is
very
much
like
an
ex
parte
writ
of
attachment
which
this
court,
i
think,
in
trainor
versus
hernandez
found
sufficient
for
a
state
ongoing
proceeding,
so
we
dispute
the
proceedings
in
this
case
started
at
the
late
date
which
my
opponent
says.
we
submit
they
started
much
earlier.
third,
with
respect
to
the
question
whether
these
plaintiffs
are
seeking
to
enjoin
the
grand
jury,
i
want
to
point
out,
first
of
all,
the
perez
versus
ledesma
case,
which...
the
third
circuit
had
no
problem
with
this
question.
they
agreed
taking
documents
away
from
a
grand
jury
investigation
which
would
substantially
interfere
with
these
proceedings,
and
they
partially
relied
upon
case
law
from
this
case.
i
think
if
you
look
at
perez
versus
ledesma
you
will
find,
that
was
one
of
the
companion
cases
to
younger,
that
in
this
case
this
court
held
that
the
district
court's
adjudication
that
texas
officials
had
to
return
property
was
a
substantial
interference.
thank
you.
