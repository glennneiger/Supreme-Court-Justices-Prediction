justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
third
circuit.
it
concerns
an
application
for
a
warrant
to
search
a
corporation's
premises
for
evidence
of
alleged
crimes
that
were
the
subject
of
an
ongoing
state
grand
jury
investigation.
i
think
that
statement
indicates
that
the
issue
is
really
one
of
abstention.
the
district
court
to
the
federal
district
courts
said
that
it
would
abstain;
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
holding
that
there
should
be
no
abstention
of
equitable
crimes.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
in
part
and
vacate
in
part
and
remand
the
case.
we
hold
that
there
is
no
longer
a
live
controversy
over
whether
the
federal
court
may
hear
the
respondent's
claims
for
equitable
relief
and
the
abstention
issue
in
this
regard
is
therefore
moot
till
those
claims
are
to
be
dismissed
with
prejudice.
so
far
as
the
claims
from
monetary
relief
are
concerned,
we
hold
that
even
if
a
case
here
some
years
ago
will
called
younger
against
harris
required
abstention.
the
district
court
had
no
discretion
to
dismiss
rather
than
to
stay
those
claims.
justice
white
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
o'connor
has
joined.
