justice
white
xxx
agreed
not
to
seek
an
injunction?
that
is
what--
justice
white
--both
the
indicted
and
the
unindicted.
justice
white
yes,
but
they
are
all
in
the
same
position,
all
of
the
respondents.
justice
white
as
regards
their
agreement
with
respect
to
the
injunction,
they
are
all
in
the
same
boat.
justice
white
well,
the
respondents
have
also
said
it
is
all
right
just
to
stay,
that
their
damage
suit
be
stayed,
haven't
they?
justice
white
no
injunction,
and
stay
the
damages
suit
until
the
fourth
amendment
issue
is
settled
in
the
state
court.
justice
white
--yes,
but
if
it
was
just
dismissed
without
prejudice,
people
who
really
know
what
they
are
doing
would
have
the
same
concern.
they
would
know
that
if
they
lose
on
the
state
proceeding
on
the
fourth
amendment
claim,
the
damages
action
can
be
reinstituted.
justice
white
can't
they
file
the
case
again?
they
can
file
the
case
again
if
they
win
in
the
state
proceeding,
and
there
is
a
holding
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
white
why?
as
justice
scalia...
why
should
that
be
so?
justice
white
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
wasn't
the
grand
jury
proceedings
terminated
before
we
even
granted
certiorari?
justice
white
an
indictment
was
returned.
justice
white
and
what
is
the
status
of
the
criminal
proceeding?
justice
white
well,
has
there
been
a
motion
to
return
the
material,
and
is
there
some
proceeding
pending
to
decide
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
white
isn't
there
some
limit,
some
time
limit
on
when
they
can
do
that?
justice
white
that
just
relates
to
some
of
the
material.
justice
white
has
that
motion
been
argued,
mr.
fitzpatrick?
justice
white
i
know.
there
is
a
good
argument
that
it
shouldn't
have
been
dismissed,
but
there
is
an
argument
that
it
should
have
been,
and
that
is
the
issue
here,
so
why
is
the
case
moot?
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
claim
is
that
the
entire
case
should
have
been
dismissed.
justice
white
and
that
still
is
the
claim.
justice
white
that
raises
an
issue
right
here
in
this
court.
justice
white
i
know,
but
you
are
seeking
to
stay
in
court
on
the
damages
claim.
justice
white
the
other
side
says
you
shouldn't
even
be
in
court
on
that
basis.
justice
white
yes,
you
want
to
stay
there
and
the
other
side
says,
no,
you
shouldn't
even
be
there
on
that.
justice
white
and
so
we
have
an
issue
under
younger.
justice
white
you
are
arguing
the
merits
of
one
of
the
issues
that
is
before
us
now.
justice
white
you
are
arguing
the
merits
of
an
issue
that
is
before
us
now.
is
that
the
rule
under
younger?
justice
white
but
the
reason
that
there
is
no
interference
is
that
in
this
criminal
proceeding
where
you
are...
the
state
proceeding
that
is
going
on
is
a
criminal
proceeding
in
which
you
are
making
a
motion
to
return
certain
evidence,
and
there
is
no
way
in
that
proceeding
to
get
damages.
justice
white
well,
if
there
was
an
ongoing
state
proceeding
that
would
give
you
the
remedy,
you
would
be
interfering
with
a
state
court.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
you
have
got,
in
this
criminal
proceeding
you
have
got
the
rest
of
your
fourth
amendment
claim
pending.
justice
white
part
of
it
is
over.
justice
white
you
don't
want
to
go
forward
on
the
damages
claim
on
that
part
in
the
federal
court.
justice
white
because
if
you
did
and
had
it
decided,
it
would
foreclose
the
state
court.
justice
white
or
any
verbal
testimony
by
officers
gained
contrary
to
the
warrant.
justice
white
well,
could
i
ask
to
make
sure--
justice
white
--weren't
there
more...
how
many
defendants
have
been
indicted?
three?
justice
white
how
many
of
the
plaintiffs
have
not
been
indicted?
justice
white
three,
and
two
of
them--
justice
white
--and
one
company.
now,
so
those...
those
are
still...
those
are
unindicted
plaintiffs.
justice
white
let's
just
assume
that
the
only
claim
that
you
had
in
the
federal
court
for
which
you
ask
an
injunction
and
damages
was
simply
that
there
was
a...
certain
of
the
evidence
was
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
you
won
an
injunction,
and
then
there
was
an
indictment,
and
you
could
raise...
every
claim
you
had
except
damages
could
be
raised
in
the
criminal
proceeding.
would
you
say
that
the
federal
proceeding
could
go
forward
just
on
damages?
justice
white
well,
yes,
but--
justice
white
--well,
i
know,
but
you
keep
saying
you
could
go
forward
on
your
damages
claim,
but
if
that
proceeding,
if
the
federal
case
was
decided
before
the
state
case,
you
would
be
foreclosing
the
state
court
from
deciding
your
fourth
amendment
claim.
justice
white
just
say
that
you
would
never
go
forward
on
your
damages
claim
in
my
example
in
the
federal
court.
justice
white
i
don't
think
the
state
criminal
proceeding
is
as
much,
almost
as
much
interfered
with
by
a
holding
in
the
federal
court
that
evidence
has
been
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
white
and
if
it
takes
as
long
to
get
to
the
criminal
proceeding
as
this,
as
it
may
be
that
the
federal
court
could
get
your
damages
case
decided
before
anything
significant
happens
in
the
state
court.
