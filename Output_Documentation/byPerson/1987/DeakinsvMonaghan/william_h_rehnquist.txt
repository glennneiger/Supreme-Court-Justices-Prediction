william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
etzweiler.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
etzweiler,
some
time
in
your
argument
are
you
going
to
address
your
opponent's
claim
that
the
case
is
moot?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
have
any
questions.
i
was
just...
you
are
going
to
leave
it
to
your
brief,
basically.
well,
i
have
a
question,
if
i
may.
what
difference
will
it
make
whether
we
just
dismiss
the
case
or
in
effect
adopt
judge
adams'
position
in
the
third
circuit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
long
as
the
state
proceeding
goes
first
if
new
jersey
law
allows
it
you
will
get
the
benefit
of
res
judicata
from
any
favorable
findings
that
the
state
court
makes
on
the
fourth
amendment
issue.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that
is
true
whether
the
federal
damages
suit
is
stayed
or
dismissed,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
are
not
arguing
here,
as
i
understand
it,
and
as
i
understand
your
response
to
justice
o'connor,
you
are
not
arguing
that
there
is
no
proper
damages
action
here
in
the
event
that
it
is
determined
either
in
the
state
court
or
somewhere
else
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
all
you
are
saying
is
the
damages
action
perhaps
should
have
been
dismissed
without
prejudice
rather
than
stayed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
etzweiler.
mr.
fitzpatrick,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
fitzpatrick,
your
brief
on
page
21
talks
about
the
mootness
issue,
and
you
say
at
the
sentence
beginning
on
the
fourth
line
from
the
bottom
of
that
page,
"under
these
circumstances,
plaintiffs
have
no
further
interest
in
pursuing
their
claim
for
injunctive
relief
in
the
federal
courts.
"
"if
this
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court,
plaintiffs
will
amend
their
complaint
to
eliminate
any
claim
for
injunctive
relief
and
will
further
move
to
stay
the
damages
portion
of
their
section
1983
action.
"
now,
i
take
it
that
is
your
position.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
speak
for
all
of
your
clients.
chief
justice
rehnquist
abstention
on
the
damages
claim
or
on
the
injunctive
claim?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
would
there
be
a
basis
for
staying
the
claim
until--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--so
then
the
life
part
of
this
case
is
the
petitioners
are
saying
the
district
court
has
discretion
to
dismiss
rather
than
stay
a
damages
claim
in
this
situation.
you
say,
no,
they
must
only
stay
it.
and
does
that
really
make
a
lot
of
difference?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
were
any
of
those
claims
other
than
the
fourth
amendment
claim
embraced
in
your
request
for
an
injunction
against
the
state
proceeding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
were
your
clients
indicted
for?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
can
challenge
all
of...
you
can
raise
all
of
these
fourth
amendment
questions
in
state
court
now,
the
same
way
that
you
could
sue
for
damages
on
them
in
the
federal
court,
can't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fitzpatrick.
mr.
etzweiler,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
etzweiler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-890,
deakins
against
monaghan
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
