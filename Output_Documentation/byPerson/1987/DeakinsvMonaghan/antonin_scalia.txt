is
there
some
likelihood
that
is
going
to
happen?
justice
scalia
it
can,
but
is
it
any
more
likely
to
happen
to
them
than
it
is
to
anybody
else
walking
around?
justice
scalia
you
say
they
haven't
dismissed
their
complaint
yet.
is
it
clear
that
they
can
dismiss
their
complaint
when
the
proceedings
are
up
here?
is
there
anything
they
could
have
done
beyond
saying
to
the
appellate
court,
we
no
longer
have
this
claim?
justice
scalia
what
more
could
they
have
done?
can
you
and
amend
a
complaint
when
the
proceeding
is
on
appeal?
can
you
go
into
the
court
of
first
instance
and
say,
even
though
this
whole
proceeding
is
under
the
jurisdiction
of
another
court,
i
want
to
amend
my
complaint?
justice
scalia
mr.
james
is
not
a
party.
justice
scalia
of
course,
i
suspect
the
only
reason
in
younger
itself
we
didn't
enter
a
stay
instead
of
direct
dismissal
is
simply
because
what
was
asked
for
was
something
we
simply
would
not
do.
that
is,
enjoin
a
state
criminal
proceeding.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
psychological
impact.
and
had
not
the
request
been
something
we
are
just
not
unwilling
to
do
by
reason
of
federal-state
comity,
i
expect
that...
why
should
a
stay
be
the
normal
remedy
rather
than
dismissal
unless
what
you
are
asking
for
is
something
that
comity
absolutely
prevents
the
federal
courts
from
doing,
and
damages,
comity,
there
is
no
reason
why
granting
damages
interferes
with
a
state's
proceeding,
right?
if
the
federal
court
damages
suit
went
forward
and
concluded
before
the
stage
proceeding
there
would
be
res
judicata
there.
justice
scalia
at
least
there
would
have
to
be
a
stay.
justice
scalia
why
do
you
oppose
a
stay?
justice
scalia
a
negative
impact
would
have
occurred
in
younger
no
matter
when
you
did
it.
so
long
as
you
enjoin
a
state
criminal
proceeding,
you
are
going
to
have
that
impact.
so
we
said,
get
out
of
here,
we
are
not
going
to
do
that.
whereas
in
this
case
it
is
not
the
case
that
giving
damages
will
inevitably
impair
the
state
criminal
proceeding.
it
depends
entirely
on
when
they
are
given.
so
why
is
the
stay
the
only
remedy
that
you
should
be
able
to
obtain?
justice
scalia
the
correctness
of
the
district
court's
action,
whether
it
should
dismiss
or...
should
have
dismissed
or
should
have
stayed
depends
on
what
the
factual
situation
was
at
that
time,
at
the
time
that
it
took
that
action,
and
at
that
action
the
injunction
matter
was
alive.
could
we
reverse
the
district
court
on
the
basis
of
a
new
state
of
facts?
it
seems
to
me
that
its
action
was
either
right
at
the
time
or
wrong
at
the
time.
justice
scalia
and
if
there
should
have
been
a
dismissal
then
because
there
was
an
injunction
pending,
why
shouldn't
we
say
that?
you
should
say
that
if
that's
what
the
judgment
of
this
court
is
based
on
those
facts.
i
haven't
gotten
to
argue
that,
but
i
would
argue
to
this
court
that
the
district
court
was
there.
but
you
can
say
that,
and
if
this
court
were
to
say
precisely
what
your
honor
has
just
said,
and
leave
our
damage
case
in
place,
it
would
be
of
no
moment
to
our
litigants.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
again
taking
up
the
different
stages,
and
i
had
intended
to
argue
that,
because
frankly,
it
is
our
position
before
this
court
that
at
no
stage
was
there...
was
younger
abstention
appropriate
even
as
events
came
about.
the
one
thing
that
we
would
point
out
to
the
court
is
that
we
did
not
seek
to
enjoin
the
prosecution,
as
they
did
in
younger.
we
did
not
seek
to
declare
unconstitutional
the
statute
which
the
investigation
such
as
it
was
was
going
forward.
we
did
not
attack
the
investigation.
that
was
not
the
focus
of
the
attack
in
this
case.
the
attack
in
this
case
was
an
attack
on
the
conduct
of
individual
state
officers
in
performing
that
investigation.
we
didn't
say
the
state
shouldn't
be
able
to
indict
these
people
because
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
statute,
it
is
unconstitutional,
or
it
is
in
bad
faith.
we
don't
allege
that
the
investigation
in
this
case
was
in
bad
faith.
you
allege
it
violated
the
fourth
amendment,
among
other
things.
