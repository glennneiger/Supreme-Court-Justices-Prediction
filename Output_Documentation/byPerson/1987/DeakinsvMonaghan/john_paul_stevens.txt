justice
stevens
well,
is
basically
what
is
at
issue,
what
is
your
argument
here
is
whether
the
damage
claim
should
be
dismissed?
justice
stevens
why
do
we
have
to
fight
about
the
injunction
now,
when,
as
i
understand
it,
they
no
longer
seek
injunctive
relief,
and
everybody
agrees
you
can
fight
these
issues
out
in
the
state
court?
justice
stevens
but
involving
the
same
parties?
justice
stevens
and
isn't
that
the
relief
you
seek?
justice
stevens
but
the
only
difference
is
that
you
get
a
dismissal
of
the
damage
claim,
but
it
is
not
with
prejudice.
justice
stevens
so
whether
you
stay
it
or
you
just,
you
know,
close
the
case
and
let
them
file
it
two
years
from
now,
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
stevens
does
it
have
any
more
chilling
effect
than
a
letter
to
you
saying,
as
soon
as
these
proceedings
are
over
i
am
going
to
refile
the
case?
justice
stevens
but
that
is
all
that
we
are
asked.
our
time
is
devoted
to
save
the
psychological
concern.
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
we
generally
decide
lawsuits.
we
don't,
you
know,
assuage
people's
feelings
about--
justice
stevens
let
me
pursue
that
just
a
second.
suppose
we
were
in
the
district
court
now
and
they
came
up
with
a
motion
to
dismiss
all
their
equitable
claims,
and
they
said,
all
we
are
interested
in
is
damages,
and
we
are
willing
to
wait
until
all
the
state
proceedings
are
over.
given
those
facts,
would
the
district
judge
have
discretion
to
dismiss
the
damage
claim?
justice
stevens
and
say
the
statute
of
limitations
is
going
to
run.
could
they
dismiss
it
and
just
say,
i
don't
want
to
hear
this?
i
mean,
doesn't
a
federal
judge
have
a
duty
to...
i
don't
understand
your
theory.
why
would
he
have
discretion
to
dismiss
a
valid
claim?
justice
stevens
say
they
had
never
filed
an
equitable
action.
he
just
filed
a
damage
action.
could
he
just
dismiss
it
because
he
doesn't
want
to
hear
it?
because
if
he
doesn't
do
it
they
will
be
unhappy.
justice
stevens
even
if
there
had
never
been
an
equitable
claim
asserted?
justice
stevens
he
doesn't
like
cases
like
this,
so
he
will
dismiss
it?
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
your
theory.
how
can
a
federal
judge
say,
i
don't
like
these
1983
suits,
i
will
just
dismiss
it
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you
have
got
pretty
timid
investigators
in
new
jersey.
justice
stevens
xxx
stay.
that--
justice
stevens
--but
they
are
not...
the
difference
in
whether
the
federal
court
resolves
them
first
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
you
have
a
stay
or
a
dismissal.
that
is
a
totally
irrelevant
factor.
justice
stevens
but
again
that
would
not
happen
if
you
were
to
enter
an
order
vacating
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
directing
that
in
accordance
with
the
representation
of
the
opponents,
the
equitable
claims
all
be
dismissed
and
the
damage
action
be
stayed.
you
would
be
protected
from
this
particular
risk.
justice
stevens
i
am
just
wondering
about
disposing
of
this
litigation.
that
would
protect
your
interest
in
this
litigation.
maybe
not
your
views
of
national
policy.
justice
stevens
well,
it
would
protect
them...
you
were
talking
about
the
concerns
of
discovery
and
the
federal
judge
butting
into
the
state
procedure.
it
would
protect
you
from
that.
justice
stevens
but
not
the
credit
rating
of
the
officers
involved.
i
agree
with
that.
justice
stevens
nothing
but
a
judgment
on
the
merits
will
do
that.
justice
stevens
well,
if
the
claim
isn't
destroyed,
if
it
isn't
with
prejudice,
it
won't
protect
them.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
stevens
you
say
about
the
injunction
you
are
not
fighting
for
it.
would
it
be
your
position
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
insofar
as
it
contemplated
further
proceedings
for
equitable
relief?
do
you
have
any...
as
a
litigant--
justice
stevens
--i
know
it
would
dispose.
do
you
have
any
interest
in
a
litigant
in
not
seeing
that
happen,
just--
justice
stevens
--so
your
litigants
really
have
no
interest
in
defending
that
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment.
justice
stevens
the
only
thing
you
want
to
do
is
be
able
to
maintain
your
damage
action.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
you
would
be
happy
with
judge
adams'
position.
justice
stevens
but
you
really
don't
care,
your
litigants
really
don't
care.
justice
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
the
claims
that
are
not...
could
not
be
decided
in
a
state
forum
are
all
damages
claims?
justice
stevens
are
those
claims
that
you
say
can
only
be
decided
in
the
federal
court,
such
as
trying
to
put
pressure
on
your
people
to
testify?
there
is
no
state
forum
for
that,
but
you
are
not
seeking...
you
never
sought
an
injunction
against
that,
did
you?
justice
stevens
you
just
wanted
damages.
justice
stevens
oh,
sure.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
that
to
the
extent
that
you
are
describing
claims
that
you
think
you
have
no
state
remedy
other
than
a
1983
claim
are
basically
damage
claims.
justice
stevens
and
you
are
willing
to--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
state
procedure?
justice
stevens
in
this
case,
i
don't
remember
his
name,
there
is
one
state
court
judge
that
seems
to
have
been
supervising
the
grand
jury,
issued
the--
--lenox.
lenox.
he
operated
in
about
three
different
areas
of
the
law.
is
that
typical,
or
is
that
just
kind
of
a
coincidence?
justice
stevens
he
doesn't
automatically
do
that
as
assignment
judge?
justice
stevens
he
is
the
one
who
is
ruling
on
things
like
whether
some
documents
were
seized
that
were
not
described
in
the
warrant
and
so
forth.
is
that
because
he
was
in
charge
of
the
grand
jury,
because
he
was
the
assignment
judge,
or
because
he
issued
the
warrants?
justice
stevens
you
did
that
because
he
was
the
issuing--
