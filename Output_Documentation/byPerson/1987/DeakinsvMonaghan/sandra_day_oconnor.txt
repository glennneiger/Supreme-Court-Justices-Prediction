justice
o'connor
they
are
not
required
to
do
that.
justice
o'connor
and
you
are
not
asserting
that.
they
have
every
right
to
file
their
1983
damages
claim
in
the
federal
district
court,
don't
they?
justice
o'connor
sure.
now,
what
about
if
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
on
them
because
it
is
dismissed?
isn't
that
a
consideration
for
the
district
court
to
make
in
determining
whether
to
dismiss
or
not?
isn't
that
something
they
should
think
about?
justice
o'connor
presumably
you
could
get
a
protective
order
from
the
federal
district
court
if
the
district
court
is
going
to
delay
hearing
the
case
in
any
event.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
up
here
the
attorney
for
the
state
is
telling
us
that
even
if
the
injunctive
relief
is
no
longer
sought,
that
somehow
younger
principles
mandate
that
the
trial
court's
decision
to
dismiss
the
remaining
damages
action
is
appropriate.
justice
o'connor
yes,
so
why
don't
you
address
yourself
to
that?
