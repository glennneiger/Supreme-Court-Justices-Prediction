justice
kennedy
counsel,
what
did
the
legislature
have
in
mind
when
they
added
the
final
phrase
to
the
statute:
to
be
taxed
as
part
of
the
cost
of
the
action?
you're
correct.
it
says
that
the
judgement
in
such
action
shall
include
a
reasonable
attorney
fee.
but
then
it
says:
to
be
taxed
as
part
of
the
cost
of
the
action--
what
did
the
legislature
have
in
mind,
adding
that?
