justice
stevens
i
must
confess
i
don't
really
follow
your
argument.
why
if,
say,
there's
a
delay...
here
there's
a
delay
of
a
couple
of
months
between
may
and
august,
between
the
judgement
and
the
fees...
why
wouldn't
you
make
all
the
same
arguments
at
the
fee
hearing
in
august,
even
if
you
had
already
taken
an
appeal
from
the
original
judgement?
and
then
appeal
that
and
maybe
get
them
up
in
the
appellate
court
and
have
the
appellate
court
consider
them
both
together?
justice
stevens
are
you
talking
about
arguments
made
in
the
trial
court
or
arguments
made
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stevens
i
understand
the
conceptual
argument,
but
i
think
the
chief
justice
was
asking
you
as
a
practical
matter,
what
difference
does
it
make?
you
go
to
the
judge
and
you
say
i
am
entitled
to
$5,000
fee
for
deterrent
purposes
and
because
of
the
work
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
can't
you
make
the
same
arguments
whenever
you
take
your
appeals?
