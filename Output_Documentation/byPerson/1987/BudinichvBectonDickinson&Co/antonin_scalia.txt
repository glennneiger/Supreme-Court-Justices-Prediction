justice
scalia
can't
we
decide
how
the
matters
will
be
appealed?
what
does
the
state
care
whether
our
courts,
the
federal
courts,
choose
to
take
them
one
at
a
time
and
make
sure
that
there's
a
need
to
reach
the
second
one?
justice
scalia
well,
i
agree.
if
there's
some
aspect
of
the
finality
requirement
that
could
conceivably
affect,
let's
say,
res
judicata
or
something
like
that,
then
i
could
see
how
you
might
have
an
argument
that
it
has
some
substantive
impact.
but
really
all
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
substantive
impact
but
the
process
for
getting
the
matter
appealed.
why
can't
the
federal
courts,
why
shouldn't
the
federal
courts,
set
their
own
ground
rules?
if
colorado
wants
to
waste
the
time
of
its
district
courts
figuring
out
what
the
correct
amount
of
attorney's
fees
is
when
it
may
not
be
necessary
that's
up
to
colorado,
but
why
do
we
have
to
do
that?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
true
but
they
don't
give
us
limitless
discretion
as
to
how
to
regulate
it.
for
example,
you're
right
that
it's
more
efficient
not
to
make
the
district
court
resolve
an
issue
that
may
be
irrelevant.
but
we
certainly
cannot
allow
an
initial
appeal
in,
let's
say
in
an
ordinary
misrepresentation
case
where
the
plaintiff
has
to
prove
a
falsehood
and
reliance
on
the
falsehood.
now,
we
can't
allow
an
appeal
of
the
first
part
whether
there
was
a
falsity
simply
by
saying,
well,
it
will
save
our
district
courts
time--
justice
scalia
--because
they
may
never
have
to
reach
the...
whether
there
was
reliance
on
it...
if
there
was
no
falsehood
at
all.
right?
justice
scalia
why?
if
your
opponent
is
correct
that
it's
one
cause
of
action
created
by
the
state,
why
is
that
different
from
this?
justice
scalia
and
you
agree
that
if
you're
wrong
about
that,
you
lose?
justice
scalia
well,
then
you
want
to
answer
my
question,
don't
you?
justice
scalia
are
costs
or
are
not
costs?
justice
scalia
are
not
costs.
