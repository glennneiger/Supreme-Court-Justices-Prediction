justice
white
all
the
law
said
is
that
the
attorney's
fees
are
required
in
these
cases.
justice
white
so
you
say
that's
different
from
the
normal
award
of
attorney's
fees?
justice
white
as
to
whether
to
grant
attorney's
fees?
justice
white
sort
of
like
in
the
treble
damage
antitrust
case?
justice
white
that
isn't
the
way
it
works
in
colorado,
in
the
colorado
courts,
is
it?
justice
white
you
mean
nobody's
ever
raised
the
point?
justice
white
but
the
practice
is
that
the
judge
decides
the
amount,
in
the
colorado
courts?
justice
white
but
there's
nothing
to
be
decided
about
attorney's
fees
except
amount,
in
colorado
rule.
there's
nothing
to
litigate
except
amount.
justice
white
well,
it
is.
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
if
a
liability
is
appealed
separately
and
it's
reversed,
there's
not
going
to
be
any
attorney's
fees,
i
gather?
justice
white
if
the
plaintiff
wins
and
the
defendant
appeals
and
wins
on
the
merits,
there's
not
going
to
be
any
attorney's
fees?
justice
white
under
your
view
then,
every
single
case
you're
going
to
have
to
litigate
the
amount
of
attorney's
fees
before
you
can
ever
appeal
and
you're
going
to
have
just
a
lot
of
useless...
everytime
there's
a
reversal,
the
litigation
on
attorney's
fees
will
be
useless.
justice
white
it
would
just
be
a
waste
of
time.
justice
white
well,
it's
bad
enough
to
have
two
pieces
of
litigation
in
every
case:
one
on
the
merits
and
one
on
attorney's
fees,
but
it's
even
worse
to
go
through
the
procedure
of
litigating
the
attorney's
fees
when
there
may
be
no
need
for
it.
justice
white
wouldn't
you
agree,
though,
that
colorado
law
is
binding
on
the
federal
court
as
to
the
entitlement
to
attorney's
fees?
justice
white
so
it
is
a
substantive
rule?
justice
white
so
the
federal
court
wouldn't
be
free
to
say,
well,
federal
law
determines
whether
attorney's
fees
are
to
be
allowed?
justice
white
or,
to
put
it
another
way,
i
suppose,
without
even
mentioning
attorney's
fees
yet,
to
say
the
federal
law
has
a
right
to
determine
when
the
judgement
is
final?
justice
white
and
appealable?
justice
white
and
appealable?
