ms.
terre
lee
rushton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
submits
that
the
adoption
by
this
court
of
a
rule
which
recognizes
that
attorney's
fees
are
collateral
to
a
judgement
on
the
merits
is
the
only
rule
which
promotes
uniformity,
finality,
judicial
economy,
and
fairness
to
all
the
litigants
in
a
federal
court
action.
we
believe
that
the
adoption
of
a
rule
recognizing
that
attorney's
fees
are,
in
fact,
collateral
to
a
judgement
on
the
merits
promotes
several
important
policies
of
this
court.
it
clarifies
and
eliminates
guesswork
over
the
timing
of
a
federal
court
appeal.
it
makes
uniform
those
procedures
for
appealing
judgement
and
for
making
attorney's
fees
applications
regardless
of
the
source
of
the
fees
and
avoids
needless
litigation
over
issues
of
finality
and
divergent
interpretations
of
state
law.
now,
the
petitioner
seeks
to
avoid
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
by
claiming
that
because
this
is
a
diversity
action
and
because
he
perceives
a
conflict
between
federal
procedure
and
state
law,
that
state
law
should
govern.
the
first
question,
then,
to
be
addressed
by
the
court
is,
in
fact,
whether
the
timeliness
of
the
federal
appeal
is
governed
by
federal
law
and
we
think
that
it
is.
the
right
to
appeal,
of
course,
is
created
by
federal
statute
28
u.s.c.
1291,
which
provides
that
final
decisions
of
the
district
court
may
be
entertained
by
the
federal
appellate
courts
and
it's
implemented
by
the
federal
rules
of
civil
and
appellate
procedure,
specifically
rule
4(a)(1)
which
provides
that
the
notice
of
appeal
shall
be
filed
with
the
appellate
court
thirty
days
after
entry
of
a
final
judgement
on
the
merits.
an
entry
of
judgement
is
defined
in
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
4(a)(6)
by
reference
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
58
and
79.
those
rules
set
forth
the
entire
mechanism
for
processing
an
appeal
through
the
federal
system.
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
let
all
parties
know
when
the
judgement
is
ready
for
appeal.
they
encompass
the
procedure
for
a
federal
appeal,
and
we
believe
that
those
federal
rules
are
intended
to
occupy
the
field,
explicitly
or
implicitly.
there
is
no
room
for
the
operation
of
a
conflicting
state
court
procedure.
we
also
believe
that
the
application
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
and
civil
procedure
in
this
case
do
not
transgress
either
the
constitutional
restrictions
that
this
court
has
recognized
nor
any
statutory
restrictions.
the
rules
regulating
the
timing
of
an
appeal
in
the
federal
court
are
indisputably
procedural
rules
and,
therefore,
a
priori,
constitutional.
they
do
not
enlarge.
they
do
not
embridge
and
they
do
not
modify
any
state-created
entitlement
to
damages
in
this
action
nor
to
fees.
it
merely
regulates
the
procedure
for
enforcing
that
right
in
the
federal
system.
ms.
terre
lee
rushton
no,
your
honor.
ms.
terre
lee
rushton
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
that
is,
of
course,
correct.
but
this
case
presents
an
entirely
different
situation.
ms.
terre
lee
rushton
the
respondent
believes
that
the
petitioner
is
not
correct
in
his
interpretation
of
colorado
law.
we
believe
that
colorado
law
has
not
spoken
to
the
issue,
whether
under
the
wage
claim
act
attorney's
fees
directed
by
the
statute
to
be
taxed
as
costs
are,
in
fact,
a
part
of
the
judgement.
ms.
terre
lee
rushton
no.
ms.
terre
lee
rushton
yes.
sir,
we
simply
don't
believe
that
this
is
under
the
same
stricture,
that
it
doesn't
create
the
same
kind
of
problems
that
other
cases
coming
before
this
court
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine
create.
this
is
a
situation
that's
purely
mechanical.
it
talks
about
the
way
to
enforce
rights
and
doesn't
intend
to
bifurcate
the
entitlement
to
those
rights.
there's
a
decision
on
the
merits
that
can
be
appealed
and
there's
a
right
to
attorney's
fees
which
can
also
be
appealed.
but
i
think
both
the
colorado
legislature
and
this
court
have
directed
that
they
are
to
be
appealed
in
a
particular
manner
and
a
manner
which
we
do
not
believe
abridges
any
of
those
rights.
rule
54(d)
and
58
have
been
amended
to
address
what
we
believe
is
the
conflict
present
herein.
we
believe
that
the
federal
rules
govern
that
question
by
designating
that
where,
as
here,
these
attorney's
fees
are
to
be
taxed
as
cost
of
the
action
there's
a
congressional
history
that
shows
that
they
should
be
separated.
the
practical
considerations
also
dictate
that
there's
a
uniform
rule
in
the
federal
courts
whether
these
matters
arise
under
a
federal
claim
or
by
diversity
of
jurisdiction.
for
example,
under
rule
58
fees,
we
believe,
are
costs
and
it
is
clear
that
when
rule
58
was
amended
in
1946
costs
were
determined
not
to
delay
the
entry
of
judgement.
that
distinction
between
the
costs
of
an
action
and
the
merits
of
an
action
applies
particularly
to
attorney's
fees,
which
are
both
practically
distinct
from
the
merits
of
an
action
and
philosophically
distinct.
they
are
practically
distinct
because
as
we've
touched
upon
it
depends
on
the
determination
of
the
prevailing,
or
winning,
party,
as
the
colorado
statute
puts
it
and,
also,
that
costs
accrue
throughout
the
litigation.
and
a
final
judgement
on
costs
can't
be
made
until,
in
fact,
there
is
a
final
judgement
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
they
are
philosophically
distinct
because
attorney's
fees
are
compensation
for
the
costs
of
going
through
the
litigation,
not
as
compensation
for
the
wrong
that
the
plaintiff
alleges
was
done
to
him.
we
believe
that
the
drafters
of
rule
58
intended
to
include
attorney's
fees
as
costs
and
that
this
delay
that
would
attend
the
petitioner's
interpretation
of
this
problem
is
exactly
the
problem
that
rule
58
was
designed
to
avoid
by
separating
determinations
on
costs
from
determinations
on
merits.
however,
if
this
court
would
decline
to
find
that
attorney's
fees
are
costs,
we
still
believe
that
this
fee
determination
should
be
found
to
be
collateral
to
a
judgement
on
the
merits.
this
court
declined
in
the
case--
ms.
terre
lee
rushton
--i'm
sorry.
attorney's
fees...
if
this
court
would
find
that
attorney's
fees
are
not
costs--
ms.
terre
lee
rushton
--we
still
believe
they
would
be
collateral
to
a
decision
on
the
merits.
we
believe
that
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
white
v.
new
hampshire
would
apply
equally
here.
a
decision
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
attorney's
fees
requires
the
kind
of
detailed
inquiry
that
this
court
went
into
in
great
detail
in
hensley
v.
eckerhart.
ms.
terre
lee
rushton
as
to
the
entitlement
to
attorney's
fees,
yes,
justice
white,
but
we
do--
ms.
terre
lee
rushton
--we're
not
talking
about
the
entitlement,
i
don't
believe,
in
this
case.
we're
talking
about
the
method
of
enforcing
the
entitlement
to
fees.
and
i
think
those
are
very
different
questions.
ms.
terre
lee
rushton
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
so.
but
i
think
the
federal
court
does
have
the
right
and,
in
fact,
must
exercise
the
right
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
federal
court
system
in
determining
how
these
fees
should
be
processed
on
appeal.
ms.
terre
lee
rushton
in
the
federal
court
system,
yes,
your
honor.
a
recognition--
ms.
terre
lee
rushton
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
terre
lee
rushton
and
appealable.
because
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
the
issue
of
finality
that
we're
talking
about
here
is
final
for
purposes
of
appeal.
a
decision
by
this
court
that
attorney's
fees
are
collateral
we
don't
believe
would
affect
the
petitioner's
entitlement
to
fees
in
any
aspect.
i
think
it
would
leave
the
right
to
fees
that's
present
in
the
colorado
wage
claim
act
intact,
but
it
would
allow
all
litigants
who
seek
those
fees
to
apply
definitive,
unambiguous
rules
to
determine
when
the
time
for
appeal
begins
to
run.
now,
following
the
white,
the
circuit
courts
have
taken
two
divergent
approaches
to
attorney's
fees.
the
one
adopted
by
the
tenth
circuit
and
applied
in
cox
v.
flood
is
the
collateral
or
bright
line
approach.
and,
again,
we
believe
that
approach
has
the
advantage
of
doing
away
with
any
uncertainty
regarding
the
time
for
appeal,
allowing
the
prompt
entry
of
judgement,
the
prompt
execution
of
judgement,
and
the
running
of
post-judgement
interests.
it
also
separates
and
recognizes
what
may
be
ethical
problems
in
an
unholy
alliance
of
the
merits
decisions
and
the
fee
questions,
involving
as
they
do
very
different
issues
and
very
different
considerations
for
the
lawyer
and
the
client.
if
this
court,
however,
is
concerned
with
the
idea
of
piecemeal
litigation
to
independent
appeals
several
of
the
circuits
have
postured
that
local
rules
and
the
adoption
of
local
rules
would
solve
those
problems.
rules,
for
instance,
that
set
deadlines
for
filing
attorney's
fees
applications,
that
made
prompt
determination
of
attorney's
fees
easy,
and
perhaps
expanded
the
rules
on
consolidation
of
a
decision
on
the
merits
and
appeal
of
the
decision
on
the
merits
with
the
appeal
of
a
decision
on
attorney's
fees
in
the
circuit
courts.
on
the
other
hand,
the
ad
hoc
approach
that
appears
to
be
advocated
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
creates
a
deal
of
uncertainty.
as
the
court's
questions
have
indicated,
there
is
a
concern
with
further
litigation
over
state
law.
not
only
would
each
state
have
to
come
to
a
decision,
but
each
statute
in
each
state
would
have
to
be
examined
to
determine
whether
the
right
to
attorney's
fees
was
integral
or
collateral
and,
therefore,
when
the
appellate
time
began
to
run.
this
would
be
a
particular
problem
in
those
cases,
such
as
bilmar
v.
igf
drilling
which
is
a
case
cited
in
our
brief,
where
the
entitlement
to
fees
arises
both
under
a
federal
statute
and
under
a
state
law
claim
and,
therefore,
may
be
subject
to
different
appellate
times
and
to
a
very
difficult
determination,
at
the
least,
as
to
how
the
attorney's
fees
were
awarded
and
how
they
should
be
appealed.
i
think
that
this
case
illustrates
the
problems
in
the
ad
hoc
approach
where
we
are
here
before
this
court
with
still
a
divergent
interpretation
of
what
colorado
law
says
about
the
attorney's
fees
entitlement
under
the
colorado
wage
claim
act.
although
the
petitioner
has
cited
several
cases
to
this
court,
only
that
case
decided
in
december
of
1987
speaks
at
all
to
the
issues
of
finality
and
appealability
as
they
affect
attorney's
fees.
the
other
cases
cited
reflect
entirely
different
statutes
and,
perhaps,
we
would
suggest,
entirely
different
considerations
about
appealability.
those
are
the
problems
that
the
adoption
of
a
collateral
rule,
a
bright
line
rule,
that
says
all
attorney's
fees
are
collateral
would
avoid.
we
believe,
however,
that
regardless
of
the
approach
adopted
by
this
court
these
fees
would
be
collateral
under
either
of
the
approaches
adopted
by
the
federal
court.
these
are
statutory,
as
distinguished
from
contractual
fees.
they
are
found
in
a
separate
statutory
provision
from
that
which
allows
damages
under
the
colorado
wage
claim
act.
they
were
never
raised,
the
request
for
attorney's
fees
was
never
raised
in
the
complaint
nor
in
any
part
of
the
action
on
the
merits.
they
are
directed
to
be
taxed
as
costs
by
the
colorado
statute
and
they
were,
in
fact,
treated
as
costs
by
the
court
and
by
the
parties
to
this
case.
they
were
first
raised
in
petitioner's
bill
of
cost,
subsequent
to
the
entry
of
the
judgement
on
the
merits,
and
his
right
to
those
fees
was
supported
in
his
memorandum
supporting
attorney's
fees
as
costs.
finally,
your
honors,
the
petitioner
requests
that
if
this
court
finds
that
his
attorney's
fees
request
was,
indeed,
collateral
and,
therefore,
his
appeal
of
the
judgement
on
the
merits
was
untimely
that
any
decision
of
this
court
be
applied
perspectively
only.
first,
we
believe
this
court
has
already
spoken
in
the
case
of
firestone
tire
and
rubber
company
v.
risjord
that
because
when
a
court
lacks
discretion
to
even
hear
the
issue,
as
the
tenth
circuit
did
to
hear
the
untimely
appeal
on
the
merits,
that
ruling
can
never
be
made
perspective
only.
but
if,
in
fact,
this
court
does
consider
the
question
of
prospectivity,
we
believe
that
the
equities
justifying
an
exception
to
the
rule
on
retroactivity
are
not
present
here.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
first
impression
in
this
court
nor
in
the
tenth
circuit,
being
clearly
foreshadowed
by
this
court's
decision
in
white
v.
new
hampshire
and
the
tenth
circuit's
determination
in
cox
v.
flood.
the
application
of
this
rule
to
the
petitioner
herein
doesn't
retard
the
purposes
behind
the
rule
and
there
clearly
is
no
reliance
by
the
petitioner
on
this
position,
when
throughout
the
course
of
the
litigation
he
has
treated
these
attorney's
fees
as
costs.
in
conclusion,
we
would
urge
that
this
court
adopt
a
rule
that
finds
that
fees
are
collateral
to
a
judgement
on
the
merits
and
that
the
time
for
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
is
thirty
days
from
the
entry
of
the
judgement
on
the
merits
regardless
of
the
pendancy
of
an
attorney's
fees
request.
we
believe
that
decision
can
be
reached
whether
this
court
decides
that
attorney's
fees
are
costs
pursuant
to
rule
58
or
whether
they
are
collateral
because
of
their
separate
and
independent
nature.
we
believe
that
that
rule
would
promote
the
policies
of
this
court
and
establish
uniform
federal
rules
for
processing
appeals,
and
is
the
only
rule
that
is
truly
fair
to
litigants
in
the
federal
court
system.
