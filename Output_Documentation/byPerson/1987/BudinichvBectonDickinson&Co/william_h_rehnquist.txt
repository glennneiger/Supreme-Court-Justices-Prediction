chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
afternoon
on
number
87-283,
joseph
budinich
v.
becton
dickinson
and
company.
mr.
frank,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
does
seem
there
is
some
sense
to
what
the
tenth
circuit
said
that
you
are
really
inviting
just
a
mass
of
confusion
if
in
a
case
tried
in
the
district
court
in
the
federal
system
you
have
to
examine
each
state
statute
to
see
whether
attorney's
fees
are
part
of
the
recovery
or
separate.
you
have
fifty
states,
of
course,
and
you'll
just
have
a
proliferation
of
independent
inquiries
like
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
this
type
of
thing
determines
the
timeliness
of
appeals
in
that
sort
of
thing.
so
it
has
a
little
bit
different
effect
than
just
a
branch
of
substantive
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if
we
interpret
it
the
latter
way,
so
that
a
state
may
vary
in
deciding
whether
attorney's
fees
are
part
of
a
judgement
or
something
added
after,
so
that
it's
different
from
our
white
doctrine
in
the
federal
attorney's
fees
statute,
then
every
single
federal
court
is
faced
with
the
statutes
of
several
different
states.
and
it
may
be
that
one
state
statute
means
one
thing
and
one
another.
it's
just
a
tremendous
proliferation
of
diversity.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
practical
difference,
so
far
as
plaintiffs
and
defendants
suing
each
other
in
real
courts
are
concerned,
other
than
the
fact
that
an
appeal
may
be
untimely
if
you
follow
one
rule?
what
would
be
the
practical
difference
in
saying
that
in
federal
courts,
even
if
colorado
might
provide
one
way,
in
the
federal
court
the
attorney's
fees
are
collateral?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
it
happens
in
federal
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
there,
there
is
a
double
appeal,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
it
make
any
difference
in
the
amount
you
recover
or
anything
like
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
reason
you
apply
erie
in
a
federal
court
is
so
you'll
get
the
same
substantive
result,
substantive
law
result,
in
federal
court
as
you
do
in
state
court.
now,
would
applying
the
federal
rule
as
to
attorney's
fees
in
this
federal
court
proceeding
give
you
any
different
substantive
outcome
in
your
particular
lawsuit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i'm
talking
about
substance.
the
amount
you
can
recover,
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
and
how
would
that
come
out
differently
in
federal
court
than
in
state
court,
if
the
white
rule
was
followed
across
the
board
as
the
tenth
circuit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
would
you
recover
less
attorney's
fees?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
still
haven't
heard
you
say
anything
as
to
how
if
you
could
recover
$10,000
damages
and
$5,000
attorney's
fees...
say,
if
you're
trying
this
case
in
the
district
court
of
the
city
and
county
of
denver,
you
couldn't
also
recover
$10,000
damages
and
$5,000
attorney's
fees
if
you're
trying
it
in
the
united
states
district
or
for
the
district
of
colorado?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
frank,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
how
colorado
judges
deal
with
this
type
of
wage
statute
which
i
see
your
opponent
says
really
isn't,
doesn't,
treat
it
much
different
than
the
federal
courts
do.
does
the
judge
charge
the
jury
that
they
may
return
in
their
verdict
along
with
lost
wages
and
that
sort
of
thing
also
attorney's
fees?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
so
the
verdict
is
just
damages.
it
does
not
include
attorney's
fees.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
my
question
was:
a
verdict
just
embraces
damages
and
not
attorney's
fees.
is
that
correct
or
incorrect?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
then
you
apply
later
to
the
judge
for
attorney's
fees?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
how
does
that
differ
from
the
federal
system?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
it's
a
question
about
when
the
judgement
becomes
final?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
frank.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
rushton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
rushton.
mr.
frank,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
frank.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
two
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce.
in
the
first,
no.
87-283,
budinich
versus
becton
dickinson
&
company
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
scalia.
we
hold
that
in
a
case
where
there's
a
judgment
on
the
merits
resolved
by
the
district
court
but
there
remains
outstanding
a
claim
for
attorney's
fees.
we
hold
that
federal
law
governs
this
situation
and
that
where
there
is
a
final
decision
on
the
merits,
it
is
immediately
appealable
and
even
though
there
is
a
request
for
attorney's
fees
outstanding.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
