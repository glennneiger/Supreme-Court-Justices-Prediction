mr.
thomas
frank
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
out
of
an
employment
contract
case
arising
under
colorado
law
wherein
the
plaintiff
was
a
sales
commissioned
agent
for
the
sale
of
the
appellant's
products.
the
case
was
brought
in
1982
when
the
course
of
the
law
was
changing
both
with
respect
to
employment
law
in
colorado
and
with
respect
to
this
court's
decisions
on
the
issues
of
attorney's
fees
and
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
case
was
eventually
removed
to
the
federal
district
court
in
colorado
and
tried
on
diversity
jurisdiction
basis.
at
the
conclusion
of
that
case,
colorado
law
was
deemed
applicable
by
the
federal
district
court.
a
verdict
was
entered
for
monetary
damages
which,
under
colorado
law,
included
as
part
of
the
judgement,
as
part
of
the
merits
on
the
case,
and
a
mandatory
award
of
attorney's
fees
as
part
of
the
relief
entitled
under
the
public
policy
and
the
laws
of
colorado.
mr.
thomas
frank
the
normal
cases
construing
attorney's
fees
have
dealt
with
taxing
attorney's
fees
as
cost,
or
as
an
ancillary
or
collateral
matter,
mr.
justice.
the
actual
statute
in
colorado
provided
that
whenever
it
is
necessary
for
an
employee
to
commence
a
civil
action
for
the
recovery
or
collection
of
wages
under
our
colorado
peace
act,
the
judgement
in
such
actions
shall
include
a
reasonable
attorney
fee
in
favor
of
the
winning
party.
mr.
thomas
frank
in
that
there
is
no
court
determination
mandated
in
that,
for
one
thing.
it
is
not
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
as--
mr.
thomas
frank
--as
to
whether
to
grant
the
attorney's
fees
or
not.
mr.
thomas
frank
it
could
be
analogized
to
that.
it
could
also
be
argued
that
this
is
part
of
the
verdict
function,
for
the
finder
of
fact
to
try.
it
may
be
that
it
isn't
even
a
court
determination
under
that
language.
it's:
part
of
the
judgement
shall
include
attorney's
fees.
mr.
thomas
frank
it
could
be.
mr.
thomas
frank
it
would
be
a
case
of
first
impression,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
frank
nobody
has
ever
raised
it
before.
mr.
thomas
frank
the
practice
is
the
judge
decides
the
amount
and
the
fact
of
this
case
is
that
it
was
submitted
to
the
judge
for
a
determination
and
this
case
was
tried
to
a
jury.
but
in
view
of
the
court's
recent
decisions
in
white
and
marek
<v@l>
[=
v.]
chesny,
the
distinction
in
the
language
here
could
be
that
this
is
not
within
the
jurisdiction.
that
is
the
essence
of
the
plaintiff's
case
before
the
court
here
today,
that
this
is
an
erie
v.
tompkins.
this
is
a
28
usc
section
1652
case.
we're
not
here
interpreting
the
federal
rules
or
the
federal
statutes
with
respect
to
civil
rights
fees.
we're
here
deciding
whether
or
not
the
state
of
colorado
could,
as
a
practical
matter,
under
erie,
make
attorney's
fees
part
of
the
merits
of
the
case,
part
of
the
substantive
relief,
part
of
the
remedial
relief,
if
you
will,
that
is
designed
to
compensate
and
redress
the
plaintiff
if
he
prevails,
or
perhaps
the
defendant
in
an
appropriate
case,
for
the
damages
suffered,
or
to
encourage
some
state
public
policy.
mr.
thomas
frank
we
would
submit
that
after
the
comma,
and
that
the
language
that
you
are
quoting,
mr.
justice,
is
the
procedural
part
of
how
the
attorney's
fees
are
to
be
collected.
that
a
taxing
matter
under
rule
54,
which
is
the
same
in
colorado
as
it
is
under
the
federal
rules,
or
an
entry
of
judgement
under
rule
58,
is
a
mere
procedural
formality
for
the
clerk
to
do.
the
clerk
can
do
it
in
one
day.
there
is
no
further
adjudication
necessary
once
the
attorney's
fees
are
apportioned
or
determined,
perhaps
by
the
finder
of
fact,
or
perhaps
by
the
court.
that
it's
merely
a
procedural
device
as
to
how
the
attorney's
fees
become
a
part
of
the
judgement,
that
they
would
then
be
taxed.
mr.
thomas
frank
in
colorado
it
has
been.
colorado
cases
not
only
dealing
with
the
labor
peace
act,
of
which
this
case
arises,
a
wage
act
claim.
all
colorado
cases
are
unitary
on
the
point
that
the
judgement
is
not
final.
the
issue
of
finality
in
colorado
is
exactly
the
reverse
of
the
issue
of
finality
under
the
white
case
and
under
the
marek
v.
chesny
case,
ruled
on
the
civil
rights
act
cases.
in
colorado
we
have
no
final
judgement
until
the
question
of
attorney's
fees
is
decided,
determined
in
substance,
and
that
decision
becomes
part
of
the
case.
mr.
thomas
frank
mr.
justice,
we
would
suggest
that
it
is
no
more
complicated
or
taxing
than
the
substantive
state
law,
come
determinative
cases,
on
the
erie
line
of
cases.
the
hanna
v.
plumber
test
requires
a
statute
of
limitations
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
or
the
appellate
procedure
if
it
has
substantive
outcome
of
oklahoma
to
be
followed
by
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
thomas
frank
that
is
correct
but
only
in
the
sense
that
finality
under
28
usc
1291
can
be
interpreted
either
way.
it
can
be
interpreted
one
way
for
the
federal
system,
if
in
fact
the
collateral
adjudication
doctrine
is
followed
for
the
civil
rights
cases.
it
can
also
be
interpreted
to
allow
a
state
under
erie
to
include
a
thing,
be
it
a
label
called
attorney's
fees
or
be
it
a
supplementary
adjudication
of
incremental
damages
of
some
kind,
as
part
of
the
substantive
relief,
as
part
of
the
finality
issue
under
that
state's
law.
mr.
thomas
frank
we
would
suggest,
mr.
justice,
that
if
the
outcome,
if
the
remedy,
is
part
of
substance,
that,
under
the
state
system
level,
then
the
erie
doctrine
would
prevent
a
simple
procedural
rule
from
applying
in
the
so-called
bright
line
manner
in
which
the
tenth
circuit
does
follow.
all
attorney's
fees,
if
they
are
denominated
as
attorney's
fees,
under
the
tenth
circuit
cox
v.
flood
case,
are
severable
and
collateral
issues
and
not
part
of
the
merits
of
the
case.
that
bright
line
rule
does,
in
fact,
preclude
a
state
from
the
option
of
including
attorney's
fees.
it
can
be
that
you
have
a--
mr.
thomas
frank
--it
could
affect
substance
in
the
essence,
in
the
simplest
sense,
that
the
trial
court
judge
would
retain
jurisdiction
over
the
attorney's
fee
issue
and
force
a
double
appeal.
in
essence,
that
is
what
happens
under
the
tenth
circuit
now.
mr.
thomas
frank
it
happens
in
federal
cases
under
the
collateral
rule
doctrine
perhaps
because
of
the
injunctive
relief
factor
on
the...
the
only
federal
cases
that
are
well-hammered
out
are
the
civil
rights
cases,
the
42
usc
1988
cases
to
implement
1981,
1982
and
1983.
mr.
thomas
frank
and
there,
in
essence,
there
is
a
double
appeal.
mr.
thomas
frank
it
does
if
you
exclude
injunctive
relief,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
very
good
reason
under
the
federal
system
in
the
federal
civil
rights
cases
for
bifurcating
the
issue
of
attorney's
fees
if,
in
fact,
there's
going
to
be
a
long
mandatory
injunctive
review
process
where
you
really
can't
determine
the
efficacy
or
the
complexity
or
the
novelty
of
the
issues
argued
and
accomplished
by
the
attorney.
school
bus
injunction
cases
that
go
on,
for
the
purpose
of
integration,
for
example,
there
there
is
no
damage
or
there's
relative
little
damage.
all
of
the
relief
is
declaratory
and
injunctive,
and
possibly
mandatory
and
supervision.
in
that
instance,
the
appeal
of
the
initial
determination
of
the
need
for
the
injunctive
relief
needs
to
go
forward
or
it
would
never
get
tested
if
you
had
to
await,
in
that
instance,
for
an
attorney's
fee
at
the
end
of
the
case,
you
would
effectively
preclude
review.
that's
not
true
in
a
labor
and
wage
statute
where
there
is
no
injunctive
relief.
mr.
thomas
frank
it
could.
mr.
thomas
frank
it
could
in
the
sense
that
the
procedure--
mr.
thomas
frank
--if
the
intention
of
the
statute
is
to
encourage
or
to
make
parties...
in
essence,
all
attorney's
fees
cases
enacted
by
statute
are
compensatory.
they
are
an
attempt
by
a
legislature
to
either
encourage
a
private
attorney
general
function
or
they
are
an
attempt
to
bring
the
small
wage
claim
case,
where
the
dollars
involved
may
not
be
sufficient
to
encourage
deterrence
of
the
conduct
before
the
courts
need
it
to
be.
mr.
thomas
frank
because
the
substantive
law
of
colorado--
mr.
thomas
frank
--perhaps.
mr.
thomas
frank
if,
because
attorney's
fees
can
be
part
of
the
merits
and
part
of
the
damages
under
colorado's
law.
under
the
latest
enunciation
of
that,
the
basset
case
which
is
attached...
there
was
a
slip
decision
that
came
out
december
10th,
1987.
there
the
colorado
court
has
said
that
the
verdict
itself
remains
modifiable
until
the
issue...
the
very
verdict
on
damages
itself
remains
modifiable...
until
the
issue
of
attorney's
fees
is
determined.
it
can
ebb
or
flow
in
relation
to
attorney's
fees
because
attorney's
fees
are
an
essential
amount
of
the
damages.
mr.
thomas
frank
it
would
be
you
would
lose
the
right.
you
would
the
lose
the
right
to
have
the
entire
situation,
both
attorney's
fees
and
damages,
weighed
as
a
total
judgement
on
the
merits
in
relation
to
the
substantive
purpose
and
intent
of
the
statute.
if,
in
fact,
the
public
policy
is
to
deter
or
to
encourage
the
bringing
of
small
wage
claims,
for
example,
then
you
preclude
by
a
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
the
timeliness
of
an
appeal
under
appellate
rule
4(a)
implementing
28
usc
1291...
you
preclude
that
substantive
modification
process
under
the
state
law
of
colorado,
if
you
apply
a
bright
line
appellate
rule.
that
is
as
close
as
i
can
answer
that
question,
mr.
justice.
the
procedure
laps
over
into
substance.
under
the
erie
doctrine
you
will
preclude
that
if
you
impose
a
cox
v.
flood
tenth
circuit
absolute
bright
line
rule.
mr.
thomas
frank
mr.
justice,
the
essence
of
the
response
is
that
you're
taking
a
portion...
you
don't
have
finality.
this
isn't
an
issue
of
whether
attorney's
fees
are
costs
or
not.
the
appellant's
argument
here
is
that
attorney's
fees
can
be
part
of
the
substantive
case
in
chief,
the
case
on
the
merits
itself.
mr.
thomas
frank
i'm
saying
that,
under
erie
and
under
the
unitary...
there
is
not
variation
in
colorado...
under
the
unitary
treatment
of
cases
in
colorado,
a
case
is
not
final
in
the
federal
sense
under
1291
until
attorney's
fees
are
part
of
that
judgement.
mr.
thomas
frank
you
could
make
those
same
arguments.
we
admit
that
you
could
make
those
same
arguments.
the
reason
for
those
arguments,
we
respectfully
suggest,
would
only
be
an
administrative
or
an
efficiency
concept
under
the
federal
system.
and
we
say
that
in
a
diversity
case,
you
don't
have
the
same...
we
submit
that
the
court
doesn't
have
the
same...
power
to
implement
1291
through
4(a),
or
any
other
rule,
where
it's
going
to
be
outcome
determinative
or
change
of
procedure
or
preclude...
more
accurately...
preclude
a
state
from
using
attorney's
fees
not
as
cost
but
in
any
substantive
manner
within
which
they
may
choose.
if
they
roll
attorney's
fees
into
the
merits
of
the
cause,
then
it
shouldn't
be
rolled
back
out
simply
because
it
is
going
to
be
a
bright
line,
collateral
issue
rule
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
thomas
frank
it
could
be.
mr.
thomas
frank
if,
in
fact,
it
could
be
a
source
of
who
decides
it,
as
suggested
earlier.
mr.
thomas
frank
there
would
not
be
under
the
peace
act.
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
frank
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
frank
the
litigation
on
attorney's
fees
insofar
as--
mr.
thomas
frank
--it
would
be.
it
would
be
in
the
sense
that
attorney's
fees
become
a
collateral
issue
rule
to
be
determined
only
after
liability.
mr.
thomas
frank
if,
in
fact,
a
state
chooses
to
put
the
attorney's
fees
issue
into
an
element
of
the
case
on
the
merits
it
is
implicit
within
that
decision:
a)
that
they
have
a
right
under
erie
to
do
it
and
b)
that
it
is
going
to
increase
the
complexity
of
the
litigation.
mr.
thomas
frank
if,
in
fact,
that
decision
is
for
a
procedural
rule
efficiency
or
efficacy
in
the
administration
of
the
federal
courts
and
if,
in
fact,
it
changes
the
substantive
law
of
the
state
or
changes
the
finality
requirement
under
state
law,
which
has
substance
implicit
within
it,
then
we
respectfully
submit
you
can't
do
it.
mr.
thomas
frank
because,
mr.
justice,
you
impose
upon
colorado
the
federal
civil
rights
developing
bifurcation
collateral
issue
label
for
attorney's
fees.
the
issue
would
not
arise
if
there
was
a
compensatory
provision
within
the
statute
or
another
condition
within
the
statute
that
was
not
called
an
attorney's
fee,
or
was
not
called
a
cost.
but
because
attorney's
fees
are
rolled
into
this
language,
arguably
within
this
language,
as
part
of
the
merits
of
the
claim
itself
as
opposed
to
a
determination,
post-determination,
of
the
merits,
if
you
rule
that
way
on
the
federal
level
in
effect
you're
going
to
bifurcate
every
case.
mr.
thomas
frank
there
has
not,
to
my
knowledge,
ever
been
a
case
that
has
done
that.
mr.
thomas
frank
to
my
knowledge,
the
issue
has
not
been
determined
whether
it
could
go
to
a
verdict
or
not.
that's
correct.
then
the
judge
determines,
much
like
georgia
v.
johnson
on
the
federal
level.
mr.
thomas
frank
it
just
embraces
damages.
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
frank
so
far
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
frank
it
differs
from
the
federal
system
now
in
that
the
case
is
not
final
under
colorado's
process,
if
you
will...
i
won't
go
any
further
than
to
use
the
word
process...
until
that
determination
becomes
part
of
the
record,
howsoever
it's
done.
and
to
my
knowledge--
mr.
thomas
frank
--it's
a
question
of
finality,
currently.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
amount
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
frank
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court:
i
would
just
like
to
correct
one
statement
made
by
appellee's
counsel.
we
finally
taxed
our
attorney's
fees
as
a
bill
of
cost
on
page
29
of
the
record
of
the
joint
appendix.
we
also
filed
a
motion
for
attorney's
fees
directed
to
the
court's
attention
because,
quite
frankly,
at
that
point
we
didn't
know
whether
attorney's
fees
were
going
to
be
costs
or
whether
attorney's
fees
were
part
of
the
substantive
merits
of
the
case.
so,
we
did
both
of
that
within
the
ten
days
required
by
rule
59,
under
both
the
federal
rules
and
colorado
state
rules.
in
essence,
this
case
boils
down
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
federal
appellate
rule
4(a)
dominates
the
field,
occupies
the
field,
and
precludes
a
state
from
having
the
ability
to
do
the
following,
which
is
the
basset
case
in
the
appendix
of
our
reply
brief:
the
jury
returned
its
verdict
on
november
5th,
1982
but
the
court
did
not
reduce
plaintiff's
claim
for
attorney's
fees
to
judgement
until
june
25th.
pursuant

54(a)
and
58(a),
therefore
the
amounts
awarded
by
the
jury
remained
subject
to
revision.
and
until
the
court
finally
entered
judgement
on
plaintiff's
request
for
attorney's
fees,
no
judgement...

the
court's
emphasis...
can
be
considered
to

been
entered.
in
essence,
hanna
v.
plumber,
erie,
and
most
recently
this
court
in
the
burlington
northern
railroad
case,
the
initial
step
is
to
determine
whether
when
fairly
construed
the
scope
of
the
federal
rule
is
sufficiently
broad
to
cause
a
direct
collision
with
the
state
law
or
implicitly
has
to
be
interpreted
to
occupy
the
field.
we
submit
that,
in
this
case,
it
is
not
and
that
the
erie
line
of
cases
should
be
followed
and
that
the
colorado
procedure
should
be
followed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
