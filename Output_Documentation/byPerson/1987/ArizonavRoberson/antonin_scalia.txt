justice
scalia
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
per
se
doesn't
apply
if
it's
a
separate
investigation
whatever
that
means.
justice
scalia
but
you
would
continue
to
look
at
the
confession
to
see
whether
in
fact
it
was
coerced?
justice
scalia
which
could
take
into
account
all
of
these
other
factors
that
you're
concerned
about.
justice
scalia
you
would
absolutely
eliminate
the
per
se
rule
so
long
as
it's
a
separate
investigation?
justice
scalia
no.
well,
then
i
don't
understand
you.
justice
scalia
i
thought's
that
what
i
said,
there's
no
per
se
disqualification
for
the
second
investigation.
you
can
approach.
no
per
se
invalidation
if
you
initiate
the
contact.
justice
scalia
let's
take
this
case,
mr.
larkin,
your
assumption
unfortunately
that
he
knows
that
he
can't
be
questioned
about
the
first
crime
doesn't
fit
very
well
into
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
because
despite
his
request
for
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
investigation
of
the
first
crime,
he
was
indeed
approached,
what,
three
or
four
times,
before
the
second
investigation
approached
him.
justice
scalia
so
this
particular
defendant
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
indeed
kept
their
promise
that
when
he
asked
for
counsel
that
he
wouldn't
be
bothered
further.
justice
scalia
well
unfortunately
that's
the
case
we're
deciding.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
why
is
that
shameful?
i
mean,
it's
obviously
in
violation
but
as
i
understand
from
the
facts,
the
officer
conducting
the
second
inquiry
did
not
know
that
he
had
asked
for
a
lawyer.
now,
that's
negligent,
but
i
wouldn't
call
that
shameful.
i
mean,
we
don't
have
really
bad
actors
going
around
here.
we
maybe
have
some
sloppy
recordkeeping,
but--
justice
scalia
--he
only
asked
the
first
one
for
counsel.
it
isn't
that
all
of
them
stayed
ignorant.
it's
just
that
the
first
one
never
told
the
others.
he
didn't
ask
for
counsel
each
time.
he
asked
for
counsel
the
first
time,
and
never
asked
for
counsel
again.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
so
you
have
one
officer
who
didn't
tell
the
others.
justice
scalia
and
that's
bad,
it's
wrong,
but
it's
not
necessarily
shameful.
justice
scalia
why
is
that
necessarily
true?
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
if
i
were
picked
up
for
a
crime
that
i
was
guilty
of,
i
would
not
want
to
answer
any
questions
without
a
lawyer.
but
if
i
was
charged
with
another
crime
that
i
was
not
guilty
of
and
that
i
had
absolutely
easy
proof
that
i
was
not
guilty
of,
i
might
well
want
to
talk
without
lawyer,
and
get
this
thing
off
the
books
right
away.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
have
people
out
there
walking
around,
some
of
whom
never
want
to
talk
without
a
lawyer,
and
others
of
whom
always
want
to
talk
without
a
lawyer.
it
seems
to
me
much
more
likely
that
individuals
decide
case
by
case
whether
they
want
to
talk
or
not,
depending
probably
upon
whether
they're
guilty
or
not,
or
how
likely
they
think
they
are
to
incriminate
themselves.
justice
scalia
if
there
had
been
no
repeated
questionings,
and
if
there
were
the
preface
to
the
questioning
on
the
second
charge
that
justice
kennedy
suggested,
you
would
have
no
problem?
justice
scalia
i
see.
so
you
would
want
to
change
the
original
prologue
as
well
as
the
prologue
to
the
second
one.
justice
scalia
what
about
the
defendant
who
wants
to
talk
about
the
second.
i
mean,
let's
assume
the
one
that
i
posited
before.
i'd
like
to
get
rid
of
this
second
charge
because
there's
nothing
to
it.
i
have
a
perfect
alibi
and
i
can
tell
the
investigators
where
i
was
and
there
are
ten
witnesses,
so
i
can
get
this
whole
thing
off
my
back.
under
what
you
want
us
to
do,
there's
no
way
that
could
happen,
because
the
first
time
in
connection
with
the
first
charge,
i've
said,
i
want
a
lawyer.
i'm
too
poor
to
get
a
lawyer.
i'm
not
given
one
by
the
police.
when
the
second
charge
comes
in,
they
are
not
allowed
even
to
approach
me
and
ask
me
if
i
want
to
say
anything
to
get
this
second
charge
eliminated.
i'm
not
sure
i'd
like
that.
what
if
i
want
to
talk?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
