justice
blackmun
is
the
state's
position
the
same
if
the
interrogator
were
to
see
an
individual
in
both
interrogation?
justice
blackmun
so
it
makes
no
difference
even
though
that
might
influence
the
defendant
that
perhaps
it's
a
continuation
of
the
first
interrogation.
in
fact,
here
wasn't
the
detective
in
the
last
interview
also
present
at
the
first
interview,
one
of
them?
justice
blackmun
but
quinn
knew
about
it,
didn't
he?
justice
blackmun
i
know
they
stipulated,
but
why
wouldn't
he
be
aware
of
it?
justice
blackmun
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
large
and
efficiently
operated
police
department,
a
request
for
a
lawyer
ought
to
be
regarded
as
known
to
every
interrogator,
xx
or
otherwise.
justice
blackmun
well,
the
fast
breaking
aspect
is
one
of
the
difficulties
that
you
face,
i
think.
justice
blackmun
yet
it
was
stipulated
here
that
the
officer
didn't
know.
