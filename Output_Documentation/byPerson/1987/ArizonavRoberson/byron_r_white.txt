justice
white
what
if
he
had
been
aware
that
he
had
exercised
his
right
to
counsel
with
respect
to
another
crime
being
investigated?
justice
white
i
know,
but
what
if
the
second
officer
knew
that
he
had
invoked
his
right
to
counsel
at
an
earlier
time?
justice
white
so
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
white
i
suppose
part
of
your
submission
is
that
any
time
a
person
asks
for
a
lawyer
and
says,
i
don't
want
to
answer
any
questions,
then
everybody
in
the
police
department
must
be
assumed
to
know
that?
justice
white
stipulation,
they
just
can't
stipulate
out
from...
the
police
can't
avoid
the
presumption
that
everybody
in
the
department
knows.
because
if
they
can,
what's
wrong
with
this
stipulation?
why
shouldn't
we
judge
the
case
based
on
the
fact
that
these
officers
just
never
knew
that
he
had
ever
invoked
his
right
to
counsel?
justice
white
so
you
say
you
just
don't
need
a
presumption
that
everybody
knew?
justice
white
but
ordinarily
he
would
be
asked
if
he
wants
a
lawyer?
justice
white
represent
him.
justice
white
so
we
don't
know
whether
that
transpired
or
not?
justice
white
well,
do
you
suppose
the
officers
who
did
the
questioning
the
second
time,
knew?
shouldn't
they
assume
that
he
had
gone
before
a
magistrate
and
know
that
he'd
been
offered
a
lawyer?
and
for
all
they
knew,
the
public
defender
was
representing
him
at
that
time?
justice
white
about
that
second
one.
