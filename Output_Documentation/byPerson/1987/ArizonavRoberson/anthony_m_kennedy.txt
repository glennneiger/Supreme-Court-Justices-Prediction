justice
kennedy
should
we
require
that?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
why,
if
this
is
what
he
thinks.
you
said
that
he
knows
that
he
can't
be
questioned
or
he
can
reasonably
assume
he
can't
be
questioned
about
the
first
crime.
what's
wrong
with
making
a
rule
that
the
fbi
has
to
tell
him
that.
justice
kennedy
well,
if
it's
apparent
then
what's
the
harm?
justice
kennedy
well,
in
this
case,
should
the
confession
be
suppressed,
in
this
case?
justice
kennedy
why?
justice
kennedy
and
you
think
the
repeated
violations
of
his
rights
are
irrelevant
as
to
the
second
crime?
justice
kennedy
suppose
the
police
arrest
somebody
for
shop
lifting
and
they
think
they
had
a
murder.
can
they
spend
three
hours
with
him
on
the
shoplifting
charge
and
then
send
in
a
new
team--
justice
kennedy
--to
investigate
for
the
murder?
why
not?
separate
crimes,
separate
investigation?
justice
kennedy
well,
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
is
different
and
you
have
a
different
team?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
you
tell
me
the
exception
in
that
i
hypothesized.
how
do
you
formulate
your
rule?
independent
of
is
the
episode
that
led
to
the
suspect's
arrest
crime
he's
being
questioned
about
the
second
time
is
a
in
those
circumstances
that
it
decides
what
it
would
be
appropriate
is
to
see
whether
or
not
the
police
knew
at
the
time
they
made
the
first
arrest
that
he
had
committed
several
different
crimes.
that's
a
more
difficult
case
than
will
happen
in
most.
we
think
in
most
cases,
it
will
be
fairly
easy
to
tell
that
the
second
investigation
concerns
a
matter
that's
entirely
separate
from
the
first,
i
mean,
that
for
example
occurred
here.
the
two
burglaries
occurred
on
different
days
and
at
different
locations
in
the
city
of
tucson.
it's
clear
that
these
investigations
were
entirely
separate
even
though
there
was
one
officer
common
to
both.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
justice
kennedy
but
you
conceded
that
this
is
a
separate
investigation?
that's
the
way
i
understood
your
argument.
justice
kennedy
but
i
thought
you
began
by
saying
at
the
outset
that
you
agreed
that
this
was
a
separate
investigation?
