we'll
hear
argument
next
no.
87-354,
arizona
versus
ronald
william
roberson.
mr.
ferg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ferg.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
larkin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
barrasso.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
may
be.
he'd
only
to
say
that
on
the
fourth
day,
and
he
would
have
accomplished
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
was
accomplished
for
a
period
of
two
to
three
days
and
then
a
new
circumstance
obtains.
and
the
argument
is,
well,
the
police
should
be
able
to
go
to
him,
tell
him
we
have
this
new
circumstance,
do
you
not
want
to
talk
about
it
either,
and
he
can
then
say,
no.
now,
maybe
that
ought
not
to
be
the
rule
of
law,
but
there's
nothing
unreasonable
about
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
miranda
means
simply
that
a
defendant,
as
i
understand
it,
has
a
right
to
not
answer
questions
unless
a
lawyer
is
provided.
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
has
to,
if
he
says,
i
want
a
lawyer
before
answering
any
questions,
send
him
a
lawyer
in
the
next
half
hour.
they
have
the
option
of
ceasing
questioning.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
as
i
say,
all
he
had
to
say
was,
no,
on
the
fourth
day
and
it
would
have
been
accomplished.
and
the
argument
is,
why
exclude
very
probative
relevant
testimony
that
helped
solved
this
crime
for
something
that
really
is
fairly
technical.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
barrasso.
mr.
ferg,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ferg.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-354,
arizona
against
roberson,
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
