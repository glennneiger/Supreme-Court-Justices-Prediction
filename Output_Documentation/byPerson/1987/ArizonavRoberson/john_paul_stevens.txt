justice
stevens
mr.
ferg,
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
white,
that
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
your
legal
position.
justice
stevens
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
if
you
have
five
or
six
unsolved
burglaries
in
the
same
neighborhood,
you
could
question
him
about
one.
he
could
ask
for
a
lawyer,
and
you'd
have
to
stop
questioning
him
about
the
one,
but
then
the
same
ones
go
back
ten
minutes
later
and
question
him
about
the
second
one,
and
do
the
same
thing,
the
third
one,
the
fourth,
the
fifth.
justice
stevens
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
well,
why
not?
why
wouldn't
your
position
permit
that?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
a
minute
ago,
you
said
it
didn't
have
to
be
a
separate
officer.
but
there
has
to
be
a
time
interval,
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
stevens
well,
i
don't
understand
why.
if
you
wait
20
minutes
and
then
go
back
and
say,
now
i'd
like
to
give
you
the
warnings
again,
and
say,
i
want
to
ask
you
about
the
second
floor
robbery.
i
just
talked
about
the
first,
and
i
won't
ask
you
about
that
any
more.
but
will
you
talk
to
me
about
the
second
floor.
why
can't
you
just
do
that
under
your
view?
justice
stevens
well,
yes.
it's
a
separate
offense.
which
is
a
separate
investigation
other
than
a
separate
offense.
you've
got
14
offenses
on
the
books,
you're
asking
about
each
one
of
them
in
turn.
justice
stevens
well,
you
have
a
separate
file
on
each
robbery.
one
was
on
thursday,
one
was
on
friday,
one
was
on
saturday,
certainly.
justice
stevens
but
none
of
those
are
necessary
as
i
understand
your
argument.
maybe
i
misunderstand
something.
justice
stevens
about
the
request
for
counsel
being
a
fiction,
is
that
true
if
three
or
four
days
go
by
and
no
lawyer
ever
shows
up?
isn't
he
going
to
think
it's
a
fiction
then?
and
that's
what
happened
here,
a
three-day
interval?
i
can't
remember.
why
would
he
think
he's
really
going
to
get
a
lawyer
if
three
days
have
gone
by
and
none
arrives?
and
as
i
understand
it,
they
never
really
do
provide
counsel.
they
say
it's
available
but
they
just
don't
provide
them
until
he
gets
arraigned
and
so
forth.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
but
you
were
making
the
point
the
fact
there
was
a
different
interrogator
he
would
still
feel
quite
confident
that
his
right
to
counsel
was
not
merely
a
fiction.
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
he
would
think
quite
the
contrary
if
no
lawyer
had
been
appointed
when
the
police
said
all
you
have
to
do
is
ask
for
a
lawyer
and
you'll
get
one
before
there's
any
further
questioning.
and
then
they
come
around
and
question
him
again
without
providing
him
a
lawyer.
justice
stevens
and
they
say
again,
we
will
provide
you
a
lawyer
if
you
want
one,
he'll
take
that
at
face
value
even
though
that
same
thing
that
was
said
three
days
earlier
and
he
never
got
a
lawyer.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
supposing
at
that
preliminary
hearing,
they
did
in
fact
appoint
a
lawyer
for
the
first
offense
and
he
just
was
representing
him
on
the
first
offense,--
justice
stevens
--would
you
think
that
if
the
police
knew
he
had
a
lawyer
for
the
first
offense,
they
could
go
ahead
and
question
him
on
the
second
offense
without
giving
notice
to
his
lawyer
that
they
were
going
to
do
so?
justice
stevens
they
could.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
arizona.
it
involves
custodial
interrogation
and
its
outcome
is
controlled
by
two
other
cases
which
also
came
to
us
from
arizona.
in
1966,
in
miranda
against
arizona,
this
court
announced
an
opinion
that
was
intended
to
give
concrete
constitutional
guidelines
for
law
enforcement
agencies
and
courts
to
follow
in
situations
involving
the
questioning
of
a
suspect
being
held
in
custody.
in
1981,
in
edwards
against
arizona,
the
court
held
that
a
suspect,
who
has
expressed
his
desire
to
deal
with
police
only
through
counsel,
is
not
subject
to
further
interrogation
by
the
authorities
until
counsel
has
been
made
available
to
him
unless
the
accused
himself
initiates
further
communication.
in
1984,
in
state
against
routhier,
the
arizona
supreme
court
held
that
the
edwards'
rule
applies
not
only
to
questioning
about
the
offense
which
gave
rise
to
the
suspect's
arrest
but
also
the
questioning
about
an
unrelated
offense.
in
this
case,
the
arizona
courts
followed
the
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court
in
routhier
and
the
state
has
brought
the
case
here
for
a
review
asking
us
to
make
an
exception
from
the
edwards'
rule.
for
cases
in
which
the
police
desire
to
interrogate
a
suspect
about
a
second
offense
that
is
unrelated
to
the
offense
about
which
he
was
initially
interrogated,
we
agree
with
the
arizona
supreme
court
that
this
factual
distinction
does
not
have
any
legal
significance
for
first
amendment
purposes.
accordingly,
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
arizona
court
of
appeals.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined.
justice
o'connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
