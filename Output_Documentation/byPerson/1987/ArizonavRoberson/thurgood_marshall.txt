why
shouldn't
there
be
a
separate
warning?
justice
marshall
separate?
justice
marshall
that
second
one
was
a
separate
warning?
justice
marshall
he
was
rewarned?
justice
marshall
so
that
they
admitted
that
there
were
separate
proceedings?
justice
marshall
otherwise,
they
wouldn't
have
given
the
separate
warnings?
justice
marshall
but
they
if
they
knew
there
were
separate
proceedings,
why
didn't
they
abide
by
the
miranda
rule
which
says,
once
you
want
a
lawyer
and
make
it
clear
the
questioning
stops?
justice
marshall
westover
was
very
well
argued.
justice
marshall
westover
was
very
well
argued.
justice
marshall
i
argued
it.
justice
marshall
i
don't
want
to
be
questioned.
i
want
a
lawyer.
what
reason
is
there
for
not
leaving
him
alone
and
questioning
him
about
anything
including
the
weather,
once
says,
i
don't
want
to
answer
questions
without
a
lawyer?
why
keep
bringing
it
up
over
and
over
again?
justice
marshall
why
do
you
do
that?
justice
marshall
because
you
expect
him
to
go
and
give
xx
and
breakdown.
justice
marshall
is
there
any
restrictions
on
how
many
times
you
can
question
a
prisoner?
how
long
or
anything
like
that?
justice
marshall
that's
in
the
westover
case.
it
says
that
once
he
says
he
wants
a
lawyer,
"all
questioning
must
stop".
isn't
that
what
it
says?
it's
in
the
opinion.
i
mean,
it
hasn't
interfered
with
the
efficiency
of
the
fbi.
they're
still
rather
efficient,
aren't
they?
justice
marshall
and
that's
what
the
state
court
says,
just
about.
justice
marshall
what
exactly
did
he
say,
did
the
prison
say
to
the
officer?
what
were
his
exact
words?
justice
marshall
well,
did,
does
that
not,
could
that
not
be
forever,
that
i
don't
want
to
answer
any
questions
about
anything
until
i
get
my
lawyer.
couldn't
that
be
interpreted
as
meaning
that?
justice
marshall
but
your
interpretation
is
that
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
anything
else.
now
how
you
get
it
out
of
that,
i
don't
see.
justice
marshall
he
wasn't
released
was
he?
justice
marshall
but
he
was
still
under
prison,
he
was
still
under.
justice
marshall
what
happens
under
your
theory
if
in
the
second
interrogation
which
is
lawful,
he
admits
to
something
that
pertains
to
the
first
investigation?
is
that
admissible?
justice
marshall
i
thought
so.
justice
marshall
i'm
a
little
confused.
the
first
question
was
by
a
state
officer,
right?
justice
marshall
and
the
second
was
an
fbi
man?
justice
marshall
oh.
would
you
say
that
in
the
second
interrogation,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
fbi
in
your
hypothetical
to
advise
him
that
they
cannot
question
him
about
the
first
crime
because
he's
asked
for
counsel?
justice
marshall
what
was
he
being
held
under?
justice
marshall
was
he
charged
with
any
crime
these
three
days?
justice
marshall
was
he
arraigned?
justice
marshall
how
long
can
you
hold
somebody
in
arizona?
justice
marshall
--arraigning
in
your
state?
justice
marshall
well,
was
this
man
brought
before
a
magistrate.
justice
marshall
did
the
magistrate
ask
him
about
a
lawyer?
justice
marshall
and
the
magistrate
could
have
appointed
a
lawyer
for
him?
justice
marshall
but
in
this
case,
he
wasn't
carried
before
a
magistrate.
justice
marshall
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
marshall
and
you
give
us
your
word
that
it's
in
the
record?
justice
marshall
you
believe
it
is.
but
there's
no
transcript
of
what
happened,
is
there?
