mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
the
proper
scope
of
application
of
the
per
se
exclusionary
rule
of
edwards
v.
arizona,
namely,
that
the
police
may
not
initiate
further
interrogation
of
an
arrestee
who
has
stated
a
desire
to
speak
with
counsel.
more
specifically,
should,
as
has
been
done
in
some
arizona
state
cases,
the
scope
of
application
of
edwards
be
extended
to
reach
beyond
its
facts
to
situations
where
there
is
more
than
one
investigation
going
on,
or
kept
basically
as
the
facts
of
edwards
were
with
a
single
investigation
where
there
were
renewed
attempts
to
interrogate
on
that
same
investigation,
or
possibly
should
edwards
itself
be
reconsidered.
now,
the
facts
which
bring
this
case
before
the
court
at
this
time
are
relatively
simple.
on
april
6,
1985,
rona
roberson
was
arrested
in
the
course
of
a
burglary.
the
arresting
officer,
perez,
gave
him
his
miranda
warnings,
and
said
that
he
wanted
a
lawyer
before
answering
any
questions.
however,
moments
later
when
roberson
was
approached
by
another
officer
who
was
unaware
of
this
indication
of
rights,
who
asked
whether
he'd
be
willing
to
make
a
statement
he
indicated
that
he
would,
and
as
a
result
of
this,
he
was
thereafter
questioned
several
different
times
by
a
number
of
different
officers.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
the
other
crime
was
not
in
the
picture
at
all
at
this
stage.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
our
position
would
be
if
in
fact
there
were
a
separate
investigation
as
arose
in
this
case,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
ask.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
yes,
sir.
so
the
situation--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--there
were
in
fact
separate
warnings
given.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
yes,
each
time.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
yes,
sir.
each
time
that
mr.
roberson
approached,
he
was
rewarned.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
i
believe
not.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
neither
in
miranda
nor
in
edwards
was
there
a
multiple
investigation
situation
going
on.
the
court
has
not
really
addressed
very
specifically
what
happen
when
you
have
multiple
investigations
except
in
two
situations.
one
was
westover
which
was
a
companion
case
to
miranda,
and
the
second
one
was
in
michigan
v.
mosley
and
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
court
included
language
which
indicated
that
if
there
were--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
and
i
believe
that
the
court
resolved--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--the
point
of
westover
though
is,
and
in
connection
with
mosley
was
the
indication
that
if
in
fact
there
were
a
separate
investigation
that
proper
warnings
were
given
so
that
the
people
in
the
succeeding
investigation
were
not
simply
taking
advantage
of
whatever
badgering
or
wearing
do
xx
had
occurred
in
the
first
investigation,
that
that
second
investigation
should
be
treated
separately.
and
that
there
shouldn't
be
an
automatic
or
per
se
exclusion.
so
the
facts--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--well,
the
court
has
indicated--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--because
there
are
legitimate
police
investigations--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--i
would
not
characterize
it
as
breaking
down.
he
was
put
in
a
position
to
knowingly
exercise
his
rights
under
miranda
by
being
put
in
the
position
to
realize--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--the
rule
that
arizona
is
suggesting
ought
to
be
applied
is
that
if
in
fact
the
per
se
rule
of
edwards
is
maintained
at
all,
that
you
essentially
get
one
bite
at
the
apple
or
one
chance
to
interrogate
the
individual
per
separate
investigation.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
certainly.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
that
is
the
approach
that
they've
taken,
but
again,
it's
the
state
of
arizona's
position
that
what
actually
happened
was
an
undue
extension
of
miranda
and
edwards
beyond
their
facts.
the
court
recognized
that
there
in
fact
legitimate
police
investigative
needs,
particularly
for
example,
the
language
in
moran
v.
burbine
pointing
out
that
it
is
not
interrogation
or
admission
per
se
which
are
deemed
unfavorably
by
this
court,
but
rather
the
abuse
of
that
process.
and
that
therefore
miranda
itself
drew
a
very
subtle
balance--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
detective
quinn
was
a
common
element,
but
he
was
not
present
at
the
time
that
mr.
roberson
actually
said
that
he
wanted
a
lawyer.
the
only
person
present
at
that
time
was
the
arresting
officer,
perez.
quinn
showed
up
some
time
later,
and--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--no,
he
did
not.
the
defense
counsel
below
stipulated
that
none
of
the
officers
besides--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--no
one
told
him,
including
mr.
roberson.
at
no
point
did
mr.
roberson
ever
indicate
any
reluctance
at
all
to
speak
to
any
of
the
succeeding
officers,
and
in
fact,
he
was
volunteering
information
which
was
part
of
the
reason
why
there
were
so
many
other
instances
of
police
talking
to
him.
he
was
indicating
that
he
had
information
that
he
was
willing
to
give
about
drug
dealers
and
about
robberies
committed
by
other
people.
so
they
were
not
there
badgering
him
about
his
offense
in
which
he'd
been
effectively
caught
red-handed.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
the
difficulty
is
that
in
a
fast
breaking
situation,
even
in
the
best
of
departments,
that
doesn't
always
work.
we
had
one
officer
here
who
was
on
the
scene.
he
was
aware
of
that
indication.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
so,
we
have
this
situation
where
in
fact
none
of
the
succeeding
officers
was
aware
that
any
indication
for
counsel
had
taken
place.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
no.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
what
mosley
did
and
what--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--not
exactly,
sir.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that,
as
was
suggested
in
mosley,
that
there
has
to
be
facts
which
indicate
a
scrupulous
observance
and
that
includes
separation
in
time.
there
was
in
fact
a
different
officer,
there
was
a
different
offense
involved.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
there
reason
has
to
be
an
examination
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
under
the
rule
that
we're
asking
for,
you
could,
presuming
that
it
was
in
fact
a
separate
investigation.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
there
are
various
ways
in
which
a
separate
investigation
could
be
conceivably
be
defined.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
there
could
be
a
separate
type
of
crime,
same
type
of
crime,
different
events.
could
have
separate
interrogating
officers.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
i
have
been
unable
to
come
up
with
any
single
factor
which
would
properly
distinguish
all
cases,
and
that's
why
it
seems
to
be
appropriate
to
indicate
that
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
is
the
only
way
to
approach
it.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
correct.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
yes.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
yes.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
yes.
no,
no,
excuse
me.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
assuming
that
this
court
intends
to
maintain
edwards
in
some
form,
what
arizona
is
arguing
for
is
that
it
not
be
applied
beyond
edwards
facts,
namely,
in
a
situation
where
you
have
more
than
one
investigation
going
on.
so
the
result
of
that
would
be
if
you
have
the
man,
he's
questioned
the
first
time,
he
invokes
his
right
to
counsel,
the
second
situation
comes
up,
separate
investigation
come
in
and
all
that
you
can
do
is
ask
him
can
we
in
fact
talk
to
you
about
this
second
investigation,
and
if
he
says,
no,
i
still
want
to
talk
to
my
lawyer,
then
you
leave
him
alone.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
the
only
wording
that
we
have
is
from
a
summary
police
report
and
whether
that
is
word
for
word
or
not
is
not
clear.
but
what
that
indicates
is
that
perez
stated
in
his
report
that
roberson
had
indicated
that
he
want
a
lawyer
before
answering
any
questions.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
that
is
a
semantically
permissible
interpretation
of
that,
but
legally
it
would--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--well,
the
only
investigation
that
was
in
view
to
anyone
at
the
time
he
invoked
his
rights
was
the
one
which
he
was
in
fact
grabbed
at
the
scene.
therefore,
it
see
unreasonable
to
suggest--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--no,
he
was
kept
in
custody.
and
he
was
approached
some
three
days
later
about
this
investigation
which
had
been
developed
out
of
totally
separate
things.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
in
jail,
yes.
the
reason
why
arizona
is
advocating
this
particular
approach
can
be
based
on
two
types
of
grounds.
first
is
precedent.
as
i've
already
indicated,
neither
miranda
itself,
nor
edwards
deals
with
a
multi-investigation
type
of
situation.
the
only
cases
that
do
deal
with
those
are
westover
and
mosley
and
they
both
indicate
that
with
proper
facts,
such
that
there
is
a
reasonable
separation
of
the
one
investigation
from
the
other,
that
in
fact
that
kind
of
a
statement
which
is
preceded
by
another
appropriate
rights
warning
ought
to
be
admitted.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
i
would
argue
that
it
would
be.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
because
the
police
have
in
that
instance
done
nothing
inappropriate.
the
fact
that
he
felt
moved
to
talk
about
something
which
was
really
not
germane
to
the
thing
that
he
was
being
interrogated
about
at
that
stage,
as
miranda
says,
things
which
are
volunteered
are
always
admissible.
so
we
have
effectively
precedent,
a
situation
which
permits
or
suggests
that
separate
investigations
ought
to
indeed
be
treated
differently.
policy
question.
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
exclusionary
rules
which
is
effectively
what
the
rule
of
edwards
is
ought
not
lightly
to
be
extended.
and
that
this
kind
of
resistance
to
extension
is
particularly
true
in
the
miranda
type
of
area.
chief
justice
rehnquist's
in
chambers
opinion
in
fare
v.
michael
c.
summarizes
a
number
of
cases
like
that.
since,
as
was
indicated
in
moran
v.
burbine
admissions
are
in
fact
favored
by
the
law,
it
says
there
that
they
are
more
than
merely
desirable
but
essential
to
society's
compelling
interest
in
finding
convicting
and
punishing
those
who
violate
the
law,
then
there
needs
to
be
a
weight
against
that
interest
what
exactly
is
going
to
happen.
to
exclude
a
properly
warned
totally
voluntary
statement
which
comes
out
of
the
separate
investigation
simply
is
not
a
reasonable
drawing
or
weighing
of
those
competing
interests.
and
because
the
situation
with
a
multi-investigation
case
is
such
that
there
is
not
likely
to
be
the
kind
of
badgering
which
were
the
very
reasons
for
miranda
and
edwards
being
announced
in
the
first
place,
it
is
the
state's
position
that
the
only
appropriate
drawing
of
the
line
or
weighing
of
the
interests
is
that
in
a
truly
separate
case
or
separate
investigation,
then
the
police
ought
to
be
permitted
to
at
least
approach
the
man
and
ask
him
about
that
separate
investigation.
and
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
in
arizona,
and
this
is
one
of
the
points
i
wanted
to
make,
the
individual
must
be
brought
before
a
magistrate
for
his
initial
appearance
within
24
hours.
at
that
time,
he--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--yes.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
he
was
informed
at
that
stage
that
he
had
the
right
to
a
lawyer,
and
as
an
indigent,
the
exact
proceedings--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--my
understanding
is
that
if
they
did
things
as
they
were
supposed
to
have
done,
the
initial
appearance
was
not
transcribed,
but
if
they
followed
the
rules,
he
was
told
that
he
has
the
right
to
a
lawyer--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--he
was
taken
before
a
magistrate,
as
far
as
we
know.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
in
the
record
which
i
believe
is
before
this
court,
it
shows
his
initial
appearance
on
the
17th,
the
day
after
his...
and
under
the
arizona
rules,
that
initial
appearance
includes
being
asked
whether
he
has
a
counsel.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
i
believe
that
it
is,
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
at
a
simple
initial
appearance,
no.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
he
would
be
informed
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
told
that
if
he
didn't
have
one,
that
the
public
defender
would
in
fact--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--represent
him
and
someone
would
be
at
the
jail
within
a
couple
of
days
to
see
him.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
i've
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
did
not
because
that's
what
the
rules
stipulate
must
happen.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
they
might
well
have
assumed
that,
but
again,
that
is
talking
essentially
in
sixth
amendment
terms
rather
than
in
miranda
fifth
amendment
terms.
if
we
are
in
fact
going
to
talk
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
he
was
not
arraigned
or
even
arrested
because
nobody
knew
about
the
separate
offense
at
that
time,
and
so
there'd
be
no
sixth
amendment
right
to
preclude
any
interrogation.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
that's
correct.
now,
one
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
about
the
facts
of
this
case
is
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
someone
who
is
volunteering
information
and
that
is
the
reason
why
he
was
repeatedly
questioned,
not
because
there
was
any
need
to
go
back
and
badger
him
about
the
offense
in
which
he
was
caught
red-handed.
he
was
talking
about
his
drug
contacts,
about
people
who
were
involved
in
other
burglaries
and
robberies,
and
that
is
the
sole
reason
that
the
other
officers
were
going
back
on
these
other
occasions
to
question
him,
was
to
find
out
about
material
that
he
was
volunteering,
not
to
badger
him.
he
could
not
have
invoked
his
rights
to
a
crime
which
even
the
police
effectively
did
not
know
was
under
investigation
at
that
stage.
otherwise,
you
are
saying
that
edwards
effectively
immunizes
a
man
to
the
point
where
he
could
say,
i
don't
want
to
talk
bout
anything,
and
25
years
down
the
line,--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--yes?
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
i
would
argue
that
they
could.
