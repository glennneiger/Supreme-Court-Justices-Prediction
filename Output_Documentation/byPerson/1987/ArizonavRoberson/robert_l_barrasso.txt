mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
reiterate
the
facts
of
this
case
because
i
think
they
are
extremely
important;
indeed,
they
are
somewhat
shameful.
on
day
one,
my
client
was
arrested.
he
was
arrested
at
the
scene
of
a
crime,
and
he
was
given
his
miranda
rights
and
it's
important
to
focus
on
the
rights
that
he
was
read.
he
was
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
consult
with
an
attorney
before
answering
any
questions,
and
he
was
also
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
have
the
attorney
present
when
he
was
asked
any
further
questions.
he
replied,
the
record
reflects,
i
understand
and
i
want
a
lawyer
before
i
answer
any
questions.
moments
later,
still
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
he
was
questioned
again.
at
that
point,
he
waived
his
rights
in
crime
one
and
made
inculpatory
statements.
clearly,
that
was
in
violation
of
his
miranda
rights.
he
was
again
questioned
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
your
honor,
it's
my
position
that
four
times,
he
was
questioned
four
different
times,
that
we
can
presume
that
if
it
happened
in
this
case,
it's
going
to
happen
again.
one
mistake,
certainly
that
would
be
negligence,
but
he
was
questioned
again
and
again,
and
i've
certainly
argued
that
we
are
going
to
put
a
premium
on
ignorance
if
we
adopt
the
rule
as
set
for
at
least
in
part
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
and
in
this
case,
i
think
we
have
seen
that
all
the
police
officers
basically
stayed
ignorant,
and
in
spite
of
the
clear
law
that
suggests
that
they
should
have
told
each
other
that
this
man
only
wanted
to
speak
through
counsel.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
he
was
then
transported
to
the
police
station
after
being
questioned
twice,
and
there
questioned
again
by
a
two
new
officers.
officer
number
one
who
isn't
relevant,
and
then
officer
quinn.
this
is
the
first
time
he's
interviewed
by
officer
quinn.
then
he's
booked.
he
spends
overnight
in
jail
and
then
he
is
questioned
again
the
next
day.
the
officer's
not
important.
and
then
two
days
later,
officer
quinn
who
was
present
two
days
earlier,
and
another
officer,
questioned
him
about
a
separate
investigation.
i
think
these
facts
are
very
important
because
the
fact
that
mr.
roberson
requested
an
attorney
before
answering
any
questions
has
to
be
given
a
broad
interpretation.
we
have
to
put
ourselves
in
the
common
sense
position
of
a
person
under
arrest,
told
that
he
has
the
right
to
a
lawyer
before
answering
any
questions--
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
--pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
yes.
i
believe
the
record
reflects
that
he
was
charged...
he
had
an
initial
appearance--
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
--no,
he
was
not
arraigned.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
more
than
three
days.
the
colorado
v.
spring
case
looked
at
this
same
issue
from
the
other
point
of
view.
there
a
defendant
waived
his
right
to
silence,
clear
waiver
of
his
right
to
silence,
and
the
police
went
on
to
investigate
not
just
crime
one,
but
crime
two.
the
defendant
in
that
case
tried
to
argue
before
this
court
that
his
waiver
was
only
a
waiver
for
the
purpose
of
crime
one.
this
court
said,
no.
when
you
say
any
questions,
he
waived
it
for
all
purposes,
therefore
it
was
okay
for
the
police
to
ask
him
questions
about
different
crimes.
it
seems
like
just
the
opposite
is
being
argued
now.
they
are
arguing
that
we
impose
on
the
defendant
some
narrow
vision
of
the
word,
any,
so
that
when
he
says
he
wants
a
lawyer,
what
he
is
really
saying
is,
i
only
want
a
lawyer
for
this
case.
there
is
no
reason
in
fact,
there
is
no
reason
to
presume
that
he
did
that.
the
reading
of
his
rights
was
broad,
referred
to
any
questions,
and
his
statement
that
he
wanted
a
lawyer
before
answering
any
questions
clearly
in
his
mind
concerned
all
subject
matters.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
your
honor,
my
focus,
or
i
think
i'm
not
showing
that
to
say
what
was
in
his
mind
in
deciding
that
he
wanted
a
lawyer,
but
how
he
interpreted
their
statement.
they
made
a
representation
to
him
and
that
is
he
could
have
a
lawyer
before
answering
any
question.
when
he's
requestioned
whether
it
be
number
one
or
number
two,
in
this
defendant's
mind,
any
questions,
here's
another
question,
where's
my
lawyer.
it
doesn't
matter
to
him
that
it's
subject
matter
number
one
or
number
two.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
well,
that's
the
question.
he
said
it
on
the
first
day
and
it
was
clearly
not
accomplished.
all
that
was
added
to
that
was
that
they
had
more
on
him.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
your
honor,
he
didn't
say
that
he
did
not
want
to
talk
about
it.
he
said,
i
want
a
lawyer
before
answering
any
questions.
so
we
cannot
imply
that
mr.
roberson
did
not
want
to
talk.
in
fact,
chances
are
he
did
want
to
talk,
but
he
wanted
to
have
the
advice
of
counsel
in
making
the
decision
of
what
to
say
and
what
the
consequences
of
discussing
that
would
be.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
correct.
and
that
was
clearly
not
done
in
this
case.
there
was
no
three
days
where
questions
ceased.
the
questions
continued
within
minutes
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
by
a
different
officer.
so
at
the
time
mr.
roberson
was
told
about
the
new
investigation,
in
his
own
mind,
his
request
for
counsel
meant
what?
i
meant,
now
i've
got
double
trouble.
there's
more
things
that
are
happening
to
me.
in
the
meantime,
he
has
been
in
jail;
he
has
not
been
allowed
to
communicate
with
anybody.
the
only
new
additional
facts
he
has
are,
a),
no
attorney;
here
comes
the
police
again
to
question
me,
no
attorney;
and
b)
they've
got
another
crime
that
i'm
implicated
in.
this
did
not
in
any
way
dissipate
the
coercive
environment;
if
anything,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
heightens
it.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
it
is
technical;
i
think
it's
very
substantive.
i
think
that
he
could
not
say,
no.
we
had
forced
him
to
switch
to
plan
b.
his
first
plan
was,
i
want
to
talk
to
the
police,
i
want
to
talk
to
the
police
with
my
counsel.
three
days
later,
no
lawyer,
new
evidence,
things
were
getting
worse
for
him,
and
therefore
it
does
not
seem
to
me
just
a
technicality.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
have
a
coercive
effect
on
him.
the
statements
made
by
the
police
whether
in
good
faith
or
not
appeared
to
him
to
be
an
outright
lie
so
that
when
they
come
in
again
and
repeat
these
miranda
warnings
with
smiles
on
their
faces,
i've
heard
that
before,
is
what's
going
on
in
his
mind.
they've
said
before.
and
it's
going
to
give
him
the
perception
that
perhaps
they're
going
through
the
motions
and
in
the
meantime
putting
together
the
case.
so
i
just
do
not
see
how
after
these
repeated
questionings,
he
would
still
feel
like
he
had
the
right
to
exercise
that.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
i
would
have
a
problem
because
perhaps
if
we
had
one
more
hypothetical,
i
would
have
no
problem,
and
that
is,
the
original
warnings
did
not
use
the
broad
terms.
but
the
original
warnings
clearly
used
broad
terms:
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent,
you
have
the
right
to
the
presence
of
a
lawyer
before
any
questioning.
now,
if
for
some
reason,
the
original
officer
said
before
any
questioning
on
just
this
case,
we
could
interpret,
it
would
be
fair
to
assume
that
mr.
roberson
did
not
think
that
it
was
a
broad
right.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
and
that
has
been
explicitly
rejected
by
this
court
in
colorado
v.
spring.
they
do
not
want
to
impose
the
burden
on
law
enforcement
officers
to
elicit
what
it
is
exactly
that
they
are
going
to
question.
and
in
the
colorado
v.
spring
case,
the
defendant
tried
to
argue
that
when
they
went
to
subject
number
two,
i
should
have
been
informed
of
the
miranda
rights
and
of
my
subsequent
waiver.
and
the
colorado
v.
spring
court
said,
no,
we
don't
have
to
inform
him
of
everything.
it's
very...
just
look
at
the
language...
he
has
the
right
to
silence,
in
that
case,
before
answering
any
questions,
and
indeed
that
simple
language
indicates
to
him
that
that's
crime
number
one,
crime
number
two,
crime
number
three.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
i
think
there's
various
arguments
in
the
briefs
talking
about
separate
members,
separate
investigations.
the
solicitor
general
asked
for
a
separate
investigation
requirement.
but
i
would
posit
to
you
any
type
of
definition
of
what
a
separate
investigation
is
is
going
to
lead
this
court
to
constant
review
to
the
hairsplitting
that
we
find
so
common
in
the--
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
--well,
i
think,
little
s
and
little
i,
if
this
court
is
going
to
adopt
some
concept
of
separateness,
this
is
way
too
blurry
a
case
to
do
it.
we
have
all
state
police
officers.
unlike
the
michigan
mosley
case
where
the
original
mirandas
had
to
do
with
robberies
that
occurred
and
that
the
subsequent
investigation
was
about
murder
in
michigan
v.
mosley,
notes
these
are
so
separate
that
his
right
to
silence
was
scrupulously
honored
in
both
cases.
we
don't
have
that
separateness
here.
he
was
continually
questioned
about
a
series
of
robberies
or
of
burglaries
that
took
place
over
a
short
period
of
time,
often
times
by
common
actors
in
the
two
separate
investigations.
i
don't
think
he
perceived
enough
separateness
to
make
this
case
the
distinguishing
case
that
the
solicitor
general
has
argued.
this
court
in
michigan
v.
mosley
found
that
miranda
needed
some
explaining.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
it
found
that
the
language
about
silence
could
be
interpreted
too
broadly,
could
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
if
a
defendant
says
he
wants
to
be
silent,
he
could
be
silent
forever
through
the
judicial
process.
that's
bad,
the
court
said
in
michigan
v.
mosley
for
two
reasons;
it
deprives
the
defendant
himself
of
the
right
to
inquire
to
find
out
facts
about
his
own
case;
and
it
thwarts
police
investigation.
if
we
can't
talk
to
the
person
at
all
because
he's
requested
his
right
to
remain
silent,
we
have
no
way
of
finding
further
information.
neither
of
these
principles
apply
when
you
request
the
right
for
an
attorney.
you
can
still
be
explained
your
options.
if
there's
some
quick
incriminating
evidence
that
the
police
think
you
might
have,
they
can
set
up
an
emergency
meeting
through
the
lawyer.
they
can
call
the
lawyer
that
the
defendant
has
been
appointed
and
say,
we
think
we've
got
something
that's
going
to
get
your
client
off
the
hook;
let's
meet
right
away.
a
thwarted
police
investigation?
no.
again,
the
police
will
still
have
a
means
to
communicate
with
the
defendant
when
he
requests
the
right
to
a
lawyer.
how
can
they
communicate
with
him?
of
course
they
can
communicate
by
contacting
his
lawyer.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
well,
certainly
you
can
initiate
the
conversation
but
you
don't
know
that
there's
any
investigation
going
on.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
i
don't
see
how
it
would
benefit
you
by
having
the
police
explain
to
you
that
investigation.
i
think
that
that
line
of
communication
is
not
going
to
be
very
helpful
to
you.
indeed,
you'd
be
better
off
waiting
a
day
or
two
and
finding
this
out
through
your
court
appointed
lawyer.
this
court
has
both
made
some
rulings
that
have
limited
the
miranda
holding
and
expanded
the
miranda
holding.
since
the
language
of
miranda,
the
court
has
made
it
clear
that
miranda
is
a
prophylactic
rule.
it
is
a
rule
that
does
not
necessarily
lead
to
coercion
but
it
is
designed
to
protect
against
coercion
in
the
custodial
environment.
the
state
has
argued
that
this
court
should
reconsider
the
edwards
part
of
the
prophylactic
rule
because
the
rule
is
not
close
enough
to
the
right.
and
i
think
to
the
contrary.
i
think
the
edwards
rule
is,
one
has
to
speculate
and
think
very
hard
to
come
up
with
a
situation
where
a
defendant
is
denied
his
right
to
counsel
before
answering
any
questions,
and
there
was
not
actual
coercion.
if
this
court
allows
the
edwards
rule
to
be
limited
as
set
forth
by
the
state,
then
they
are
going
to
allow
the
defendant
to
be
not
implicitly
lied
to
perhaps
that's
too
strong
of
a
word,
but
basically
given
a
falsehood.
we
are
going
to
allow
the
defendant
to
be
told
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
lawyer
before
answering
any
questions,
and
in
spite
of
that
warning,
we
are
going
to
allow
him
to
be
continued
to
be
questioned.
this
tells
the
defendant
that
whatever
that
rule
was,
whatever
that
right
was,
it's
not
a
very
valuable
one
in
my
position
of
sitting
here
in
the
jail
cell
without
any
input
from
anybody
waiting
for
that
lawyer,
the
only
thing
i
can
find
out
is
that
there's
more
trouble
with
me,
that
leads
to
coercion
i
think
in
almost
every
instance,
that
this
is
not
a
rule
that
is
widely
around
the
fifth
amendment
but
a
prophylactic
rule
that
is
very
tightly
concealed
to
just
the
protection
that
is
needed
for
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
yes.
i
think
that
that's
fair.
i
don't
think
that
that's
too
heavy
of
a
burden.
i
think
it
exists
today.
and
if
this
court
looks
at
several
of
the
cases
at
issue
here,
michigan
v.
jackson,
colorado
v.
spring,
there's
continual
references
to
the
recordkeeping
devices
already
set
up
in
most
police
departments.
they
have
the
miranda
warnings,
they
have
check
lists,
those
check
lists
are
filed
with
the
police
report.
as
easily
as
the
fbi
can
find
out
that
the
defendant
is
in
jail
in
pema
county,
arizona,
they
can
ask
in
that
same
book
of
records,
has
he
been
mirandasized,
has
he
requested
counsel.
this
is
already
being
done.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
no,
that
is,
it
is
stipulated
that
they
didn't
know,
but
it
has
been
argued
by
the
solicitor
general
that
we
will
put
too
heavy
a
burden
on
the
subsequent
investigative
agencies
to
find
out.
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
valid
argument
in
light
of
the
ease
of
recordkeeping
to
simply
check
off
whether
he's
requested
a
lawyer
or
not.
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
i
think
that
this
court
does
have...
i
think
that's
the
status
of
it,
but
my
question
is,
what
is
the
relevance
of
their
ignorance
when
the
issue
here
is
to
prevent
coercive
confessions,
not
to
put
a
broad
exclusionary
rule
or
to
deter--
mr.
robert
l.
barrasso
--no.
i
think
the
knowledge
of
the
police
officers
is
irrelevant.
i
think
the
earlier
examples
by
the
court
are
good
ones.
you
could
have
knowing
officers
or
ignorant
officers
come
in
every
ten
minutes
and
ask
the
questions,
and
every
time
they
say
to
the
defendant,
you
have
the
right
to
a
lawyer
before
answering
any
questions,
and
proceed
to
ask
questions,
what
does
that
say
to
the
defendant
but
that
what
we're
saying
is
not
what
should
be
given
in
its
normal
meaning.
i
don't
know
what
it
would
mean
to
a
defendant.
maybe
he's
figuring
well
what
does
my
right
to
a
lawyer
mean.
when
do
i
get
my
lawyer.
these
are
questions,
these
are
any
questions,
and
they're
still
coming,
with
the
added
coercive
feeling
that
they
are
accumulating
new
evidence
while
i
sit
in
jail
incommunicado
with
anybody.
i'm
finished
unless
this
court
has
any
further
questions.
