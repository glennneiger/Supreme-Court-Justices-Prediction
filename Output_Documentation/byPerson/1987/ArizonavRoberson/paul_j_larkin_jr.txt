mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
not
uncommon
for
a
suspect
to
be
implicated
in
two
or
more
crimes
that
are
being
separately
investigated
by
different
law
enforcement
officers
or
even
entirely
different
law
enforcement
agencies.
and
i'd
therefore
like
to
use
an
example
to
help
illustrate
our
position
in
this
case.
the
tucson,
arizona
police
arrest
a
suspect
for
the
hold-up
of
a
package
store.
at
the
same
time,
the
fbi
may
have
reason
to
believe
that
this
person
has
been
involved
in
an
unrelated
armed
bank
robbery,
a
crime
occurring
at
a
different
time
and
in
a
different
location.
if
the
suspect
invokes
his
right
to
silence,
then
under
mosley,
the
fbi
would
be
able
to
approach
the
suspect
to
see
if
he
is
willing
to
talk
with
them
about
the
bank
robberies.
if
the
suspect
invokes
his
right
to
counsel,
but
later
released,
then
the
fbi
can
approach
the
suspect
about
the
armed
bank
robberies.
now,
it's
our
position
that
the
fbi
should
not
be
forbidden
from
approaching
the
suspect
to
ask
him
if
he
wants
to
talk
about
the
bank
robberies
simply
because
the
suspect
has
invoked
his
right
to
counsel,
and
even
though
the
suspect
has
not
yet
been
released
from
police
custody.
that
submission,
to
believe,
is
consistent
with
the
edwards
case.
edwards
was
concerned
with
the
potential
for
badgering
when
the
police
are
allowed
repeatedly
to
interrogate
a
suspect
who
has
asked
for
a
lawyer.
when
there
are
truly
independent
investigations
that
are
underway,
that
risk
we
believe
is
far
less
likely
to
be
present.
that's
true
whether
you
look
at
the
problem
from
the
suspect's
point
of
view
or
from
the
police
point
of
view.
first,
when
the
officers
approach
the
suspect,
if
they
make
clear
at
the
outset
either
before
or
after
giving
miranda
warnings,
that
they
are
interested
in
an
entirely
different
matter,
the
suspect
is
not
likely
to
believe
that
his
request
for
counsel
has
been
fictional.
he's
likely
to
believe
instead
that
he
can
control
what
is
out
of
bounds.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
that
isn't
likely
to
be
something
he's
going
to
blame
at
the
doorstep
of,
in
my
example
for
instance,
the
fbi
when
they
come
into
to
talk
to
him.
if
he
says
in
that
circumstance,
i
asked
for
a
lawyer,
they
didn't
give
me
one,
i
don't
want
to
talk
with
you,
the
fbi
can't
question
him.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
because
he
has
invoked
his
right
to
counsel
with
respect
to
what's
there.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
he's
not
going
to
believe
it's
fictional
in
a
sense
that
they
are
just
going
to
repeatedly
interrogate
him
even
though
he's
asked
for
it.
if
he
has
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
they
have
left
him
alone
for
three
days,
he
knows
that
by
asking
for
a
lawyer,
the
police
are
no
longer
going
to
badger
him
or
question
him.
and
if
the
new
officers
come
in
and
tell
him
at
the
outset
that
they
want
to
talk
about
a
different
matter--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
he
may
not
take
it
at
literal
face
value,
but
what
he
will
realize
is
this:
he'll
realize
that
these
police
have
told
him
they're
going
to
talk
about
a
different
matter.
he
knows
then
that
his
request
for
a
lawyer
has
at
least
allowed
him
to
avoid
questioning
about
the
first
matter.
he's
likely
to
believe
therefore
that
he
can
control
the
subject
of
the
questioning.
because
he
hasn't
been
questioned
beforehand,
if
he
doesn't
want
to
be
questioned
this
time,
he's
likely
to
believe
he
just
has
to
say,
i
don't
want
to
talk,
or
i
want
a
lawyer,
and
then
in
our
submission,
that
questioning
would
have
to
cease.
so
by
fictional,
i
mean
in
a
sense
of
just
ignoring
it
right
then
and
there
and
just
going
ahead
with
questioning.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
a
local
police
officer,
your
honor,
xx--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--in
my
hypothetical,
not
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
would
certainly
be
an
appropriate
thing
for
the
fbi
to
do.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
whether
you're
going
to
require
an
additional
warning--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--of
that
type
i
think
would
be
inappropriate.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
because
i
think
it
would
probably
become
as
soon
as
he
starts
asking
a
question.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
harm
may
simply
be
that
adding
an
additional
type
of
rule
into
this
circumstance
may
perhaps
complicate
the
matter
unnecessarily.
i
mean,
take
this
case
for
example.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
he...
that's
because
of
the
peculiarities
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
is
recognize
that
this
general
rule
should
apply.
we
don't
think
that
the
facts
of
this
case
should
preclude
the
court
from
adopting
it,
and
we
also
don't
think
the
facts
of
this
case
counsel
against
it.
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
reason
he
was
approached
during
this
interim
was
he
also
said
at
the
very
outset
to
the
second
officer
who
approached
him
that
he
would
be
willing
to
talk.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
confession
in
this
case
should
not
be.
the
confession
he
gave
in
this
case
was--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--was
one
that
was
on
april
19th
about
the
april
16th
burglary.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it's
relevant
only
if
you
take
into
account
the
possibility
that
his
waiver
has
been
overcome
because
he's
been
badgered
by
the
police.
in
that
respect,
we're
not
saying
that
these
factors
can't
be
taken
into
account
in
deciding
whether
the
suspect
has
validly
waived
his
rights.
our
position
is
simply
that
the
officer
who
is
conducting
the
independent
investigation
should
be
entitled
to
approach
the
person
to
find
out
if
he
is
willing
to
discuss
the
new
subject
matter.
and
the
reason
why,
one
of
the
reasons
why
he
should
be
allowed
to
approach
him
is
he
may
not
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
new
subject
matter
at
issue.
this
allows
them
to
bring
it
to
his
attention.
he
may
have
an
alibi
in
which
case
that
would
end
the
inquiry.
alternatively
he
may
realize
now
that
he's
in
a
lot
deeper
trouble
than
he
was
the
first
time,
and
he
may
be
willing
to
answer
questions
about
the
second
matter
in
order
to
obtain
a
reduced
charge
or
some
other
type
of
benefit.
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
say
that
the
police
are
just
licensed
to
badger
a
person
simply
because
they're
pursuing
a
separate
investigation.
our
request
is
simply
that
they
be
permitted
to
approach
the
suspect
to
find
out
what
his
wishes
are.
the
police
have
to
be
in
fact
pursuing
a
separate
investigation
and
they
have
to
obtain
a
valid
waiver
of
a
person's
rights
during
that--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
i
think
not.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it's
not...
both...
the
factors
that
have
to
be
considered
in
deciding
whether
you
have
a
separate
investigation
we
think
are
first,
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
and
second
the
identity
of
the
people
conducting
it.
it's
not
simply--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--you
may
have
a
different
team
there
in
that
circumstance,
but
it
may
also
be
that
the
police
knew
this
person
had
committed
the
murder
at
the
time
they
made
the
arrest,
and
in
that
sort
of
circumstance,
it
may
not
be
appropriate
to
apply
this
sort
of
rule.
because
we're
not
saying
that
the
police--
