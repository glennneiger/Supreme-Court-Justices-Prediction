justice
o'connor
mr.
harrison,
i
guess
this
respondent
was
later
convicted
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
justice
o'connor
and
that
conviction
is
on
appeal,
is
it?
justice
o'connor
has
the
eighth
circuit
ruled
yet?
justice
o'connor
if
it
were
to
do
so,
is
this
case
moot?
justice
o'connor
well,
ms.
curtin--
justice
o'connor
--i
gather
that
you
and
the
government
disagree
on
when
that
other
statute
becomes
operative.
justice
o'connor
do
i
not
understand
that
they
now
take
the
position
that
the
conviction
won't
be
final
until
after
his
appeal?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
district
court
was
proper
to
decide
this
on
a
facial
challenge
rather
than
to
wait
and
see
what
happened?
