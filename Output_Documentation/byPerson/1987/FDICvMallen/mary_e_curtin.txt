ms.
mary
e.
curtin
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
this
court
has
often
stated,
due
process
requires
some
kind
of
hearing,
and
that
that
hearing
take
place
at
a
meaningful
time
and
in
a
meaningful
manner.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
the
application
of
these
general
principles
to
the
specific
statutory
scheme
of
12
u.s.c.
1818(g).
appellee
mr.
mallen
contends
that
the
statute
is
deficient
in
both
respects.
there
is
no
statutory
assurance
of
a
hearing
at
a
meaningful
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
i
believe
we
have
a
fact
question
here,
mr.
mallen
was
not
going
to
have
a
hearing.
in
response
to
some
questions
asked
by
the
court,
the
notice
to
suspend
mr.
mallen
was
issued
on
january
20th,
1986.
it
was
served
upon
him
on
january
26th.
on
january
30th,
mr.
mallen's
attorney
requested
an
immediate
hearing.
the
statute
says,
the
hearing
will
take
place
within
30
days,
the
decision
will
be
rendered
within
an
additional
60.
on
january
30th
mr.
mallen's
attorney
requested
an
immediate
hearing
on
february
9.
mr.
mallen's
criminal
trial
at
this
point
was
scheduled
to
commence
on
march
16th.
in
a
series
of
correspondence
between
the
agency
and
mr.
mallen's
attorney
it
was
finally
resolved
by
the
agency
that
they
would
afford
mr.
mallen
his
hearing
some
time
on
february
20th.
the
agency
refused
to
make
any
representations
whatsoever
as
to
how
much
of
the
additional
60
days
the
agency
would
take
or
require
in
order
to
render
a
decision.
sixty
days
from
february
20th
is
april
20th,
which
is
approximately
a
month
after
mr.
mallen's
criminal
trial
has
ended.
when
the
federal
district
court
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
february
17
of
1987,
the
fdic
asked
the
judge
to
reconsider
the
decision,
and
at
that
point
said
they
would
afford
mr.
mallen
an
expedited
hearing
and
an
expedited
decision.
the
dates
presented
by
the
fdic
to
judge
o'brien
would
have
given
mr.
mallen
a
decision
on
his
case
on
april
8th,
which
was
approximately
three
weeks
after
his
criminal
trial
ended.
the
date
of
the
criminal
trial
is
important
because
the
criminal
trial,
regardless
of
the
way
it
is
resolved,
avoids
the
necessity
of
convening
any
hearing
at
all
or
if
the
hearing
has
been
convened
but
a
decision
has
not
been
rendered,
it
avoids
the
necessity
of
rendering
a
decision.
had
mr.
mallen
been
acquitted,
the
suspension
would
have
dissolved
of
its
own
weight
pursuant
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
mallen
was
convicted.
when
an
individual
is
convicted
of
a
crime,
another
statute,
12
u.s.s.
1829,
says
that
he
will
be
immediately
suspended
from
any
position
as
an
officer,
director,
or
employee
of
any
bank
in
this
country
whose
deposits
are
insured
by
the
fdic,
and
this
is
not--
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
--pending
appeal.
excuse
me.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
no,
your
honor,
we
don't,
and
the
reason
we
don't
is
because
when
mr.
mallen
was
convicted
the
fdic
brought
an
action
which
you
will
see
referenced,
i
believe,
in
our
brief,
fdic
versus
mallen,
to
immediately
require
mr.
mallen's
suspension
from
the
bank
pursuant
to
12
u.s.c.
1829.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
well,
your
honor,
they
are
taking
the
position,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
conviction
isn't
final
until
after
his
appeal,
but
the
language
of
1829
does
not
say
that
you
shall
be
removed
when
your
conviction
is
final.
it
says
you
shall
be
removed
when
you
are
convicted,
period.
i
argued
the
case
concerning
the
application
of
12
u.s.c.
1829.
i
took
the
position...
there
is
some
humor
in
this
now...
that
section
1829
should
not
operate
to
remove
mr.
mallen
until
the
appeal,
notwithstanding
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
fdic
argued
that
section
1829
clearly
contemplated
an
immediate
termination
upon
conviction
notwithstanding
appeal.
the
federal
judge
ruled
in
favor
of
the
fdic
and
mr.
mallen
was
immediately
terminated.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
it
was
mr....
no,
it
wasn't
mr.
harrison.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
i
am
just
saying
now
we
have
all
changed
sides,
but
there
is
a
court
case
that
specifically
interprets
that
statute,
the
only
one
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor,
and
it
ruled
in
favor
of
the
fdic's
position
that
the
conviction,
the
entry
of
the
conviction
operated
to
terminate
the
individual's
ability
to
work
not
just
in
the
kanawha
bank,
where
mr.
mallen
was
employed,
but
any
bank
whose
deposits
are
insured.
there
is
some
reference
to
the
reading
of
those
statutes
together,
their
differences
and
their
similarities,
in
our
brief.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
it
was
very
clear,
your
honor,
and
some
of
this...
all
of
this
correspondence,
i
believe,
is
in
the
appendix
that
we
were
not
going
to
get
a
hearing
from
the
fdic
where
a
decision
would
have
been
rendered
even
close
to
when
mr.
mallen's
criminal
trial
had
been
over.
had
that
been
possible,
we
would
have
continued,
obviously,
to
proceed
in
an
attempt
to
have
the
issue
resolved,
but
no
dates
suggested
by
the
fdic
before
or
after
judge
o'brien
ruled
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
would
have
afforded
us
a
decision
within
even
three
weeks
of
his
conviction.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
i
read
judge
o'brien's
decision,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
to
indicate
that
he
felt
that
the
statute
was
applied
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
i
read
him
to
go
farther,
however,
and
say
because
of
the
fdic's
refusal
to
accommodate
the
time
periods
of
the
speedy
trial
act,
it
was
reasonable
to
conclude
that
not
just
mr.
mallen
but
any
individual
who
invoked
his
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
would
not
have
a
hearing
by
the
fdic
on
this
issue.
we
were
forced
to
choose
between
our
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
and
what
judge
o'brien
and
i
felt
were
our
constitutional
right
to
a
hearing
post-suspension.
we
could
not
have
both.
that
was
extremely
clear
from
the
posture
of
this
case
from
the
beginning,
and
given
the
fdic's
repeated
assertions
that
it
is
just
impossible
for
them
to
convene
and
dispose
of
a
case
like
this
within
70
days,
no
one
is
going
to
have
their
hearing
if
they
insist
upon
their
parallel
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
in
anticipation
of
this
question,
i
read
a
number
of
cases
that
attempted
to
distinguish
a
facial
challenge
to
a
statute
from
a
statute
that
was
unconstitutional
as
applied,
and
i
am
afraid
i
have
to
admit
to
this
court
that
i
concluded
that
there
was
an
extremely
gray
area
in
the
middle,
and
i
will
tell
you
quite
candidly
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
a
facial
challenge
to
the
statute
or
if
it
was
just
unconstitutional
as
applied.
but
i
do
know,
chief
justice,
that
when
it
was
all
over
with,
my
client
had
no
hearing,
and
my
client
was
never
going
to
have
a
hearing.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
from
the
cases
i
read,
yes,
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
facial
challenge
to
a
statute,
my
understanding
was
that
there
were
no
set
of
circumstances--
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
--well,
the
set
of
circumstances
that
i
could
foresee
that
would
allow
the
statute
to
be
constitutional--
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
--justice
white,
if
the
agency
had
proposed
anything
near
that
kind
of
timetable
with
my
client
i
wouldn't
be
standing
here.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
no,
we
did
not.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
no,
we
didn't.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
it
has
never
been
contested
in
any
posture
of
this
case
that
we
had
a
right
to
a
pre-suspension
hearing.
it
has
consistently
been
our
position
that
we
had
a
constitutional
right
to
a
post-suspension
hearing
to
the
extent
that
we
have
discussed
the
total
lack,
total
lack
of
pre-suspension
procedures,
we
have
discussed
them
in
an
attempt
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
they
put...
the
total
lack
of
pre-suspension
procedures
places
a
higher
burden
on
the
fdic
as
to
the
nature
of
the
post-suspension
proceeding.
one
of
the
matthews
tests
is
obviously
the
likelihood
of
an
erroneous
deprivation.
to
the
extent
that
there
are
no
pre-suspension
procedures
whatsoever,
clearly
the
likelihood
of
an
erroneous
deprivation
is
extremely
high.
that
being
the
case,
to
correspondingly
suggest
that
we
do
not
necessarily
have
the
right
to
present
witnesses,
we
do
not
necessarily
have
the
right
to
cross
examine
witnesses,
i
believe
is
constitutionally
defective.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
justice
scalia,
the
reason
the
trial
is
important
to
me
and
the
reason
it
is
the
trigger
is
because
whatever
the
result
of
the
trial,
the
posture
of
the
administrative
proceeding
will
then...
if
you
follow
me.
again,
i
have
the
trial--
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
--the
resolution
of
the
trial
is
going
to
moot,
for
lack
of
a
better
word,
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
resolution,
the
administrative
proceeding.
that
being
the
case,
i
have
suffered
a
final
deprivation
without
any
administrative
proceedings
whatsoever
in
the
same
exact
way
that
mr.
barchi
suffered
a
final
deprivation
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
15
days
after
he
was
suspended,
his
job
was
returned
to
him.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
the
feinberg
court
made
that
observation.
the
problem
is,
as
the
feinberg
court
noted,
congress
understands
the
difference
presumably
between
the
word
"shall"
and
the
word
"may",
and
congress
did
not
say,
if
an
individual
is
indicted
he
shall
be
removed
from
the
bank.
it
said
may.
which
made
it
discretionary,
and
congress
proceeded
from
the
discretionary
language
of
may
to
even
farther,
put
on
a
certain
criteria
that
should
be
looked
at
before
that
discretion
is
exercised.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
once
there
is
agency
discretion,
there
is
a
possibility
of
an
erroneous
deprivation,
and
once
there
is
a
possibility
of
an
erroneous
deprivation
there
will
be
some
kind
of
hearing.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
it
may
be
rational.
i
don't
believe--
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
--i
think
we
need
to
focus
on
something
else
here,
justice
scalia,
because
perhaps,
maybe
i
am
wrong,
but
perhaps
this
is
the
source
of
the
confusion
between
us,
or
the
disagreement.
if
we
had
had
our
hearing,
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
was
not
to
decide
whether
mr.
mallen
was
guilty
or
innocent.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
was
not
to
decide
any
facts
pertaining
to
his
indictment
or
the
reason
for
his
indictment.
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
mr.
mallen's
continued
presence
in
the
institution
resulted
in
a
damage
to
its
depositors
or
impaired
the
public
confidence
of
the
institution.
we
were
never
told
of
the
facts,
ever,
as
i
speak,
of
the
facts
that
caused
the
fdic
to
conclude
that
this
factual
showing,
conclusion
could
be
made.
this
bank
was
in
a
town
of
750
people.
mr.
mallen's
indictment
got
publicity
well
beyond
the
town,
well
beyond
the
state
of
iowa.
the
normal
indicia
of
lack
of
public
confidence
in
an
institution
is
deposit
runoff,
various
things
having
to
do
with
financial
integrity.
none
of
that
happened.
to
the
contrary,
the
people
in
kanawha
supported
mr.
mallen.
notwithstanding
all
of
this
the
fdic
makes
a
discretionary
conclusion
without,
again,
benefit
of
so
much
as
one
fact
in
support
of
that
being
told
to
mr.
mallen
or
anyone
representing
him,
that
he
presents
a
danger
to
the
bank,
that
his
presence
is
impairing
the
public
confidence
in
the
institution,
and
he
is
gone,
and
not
only
is
he
gone,
but
he
is
never
going
to
have
a
hearing.
i
believe
that
we
can
sit
here
and
discuss
what
that
hearing
should
be.
we
are
saying
it
doesn't
need
to
come
first,
it
can
come
later.
we
can
discuss
the
nature
of
that
hearing.
but
i
don't
believe
that
we
can
sit
here
now
and
discuss
whether
or
not
mr.
mallen
has
a
right
to
some
kind
of
hearing,
or
in
the
alternative,
if
mr.
mallen
has
to
waive
his
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
in
order
to
secure
it.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
the
previous--
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
--yes,
previous
to
the
indictment
in
september.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
it
went
on
before
an
administrative
law
judge.
a
hearing
commenced.
the
hearing
did
not
finish.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
my
client
was
on
the
stand
to
testify
when
the
judge
declared...
the
judge
recused
himself.
the
hearing
never
ended.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
he
was
indicted
in
december.
the
fdic
never--
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
--yes,
your
honor.
the
fdic
knew
quite
a
bit
about
the
bank.
however,
the
purpose
of
that
hearing
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
mr.
mallen
had
engaged
in
unsound
banking
practices
and
or
violated--
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
--yes,
but
the
standards
for
removal
under
8(e),
which
was
the
administrative
proceeding,
had
nothing
to
do
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
with
the
standards
for
suspension
under
8(g).
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
had
that
hearing
been
concluded,
there
would
have
been
no
testimony
in
that
hearing
having
anything
to
do
with
impairment
of
public
confidence
or
damage
to
the
depositors.
it
had
to
do
with
unsound
banking
practices.
the
problem
of
utilizing,
as
it
is
suggested,
the
transcript
of
that
hearing
as
evidence
concerning
the
factfinding
required
in
8(g)
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
the
facts
were
totally
different.
secondly,
i
think
we
have
another
constitutional
problem
with
using
a
transcript
where
i
hadn't
had
an
opportunity
to
present
my
defense.
again,
i
don't
believe
that
we
are
discussing
here
something
that
i
would
consider
to
be
esoteric
due
process.
we
are
not
looking
at
the
finer
points
of
the
requirements
of
a
hearing.
we
are
not
looking
at
the
finer
points
of
what
pre-suspension
due
process
as
opposed
to
post-suspension
due
process
and
how
the
two
should
come
together.
we
are
looking
at
whether
or
not
there
is
ever
going
to
be
a
hearing
at
all.
i
find
the
barchi
case
controlling.
the
suspension
there
was
25
days.
mr.
barchi
clearly
was
back
working
before
he
had
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
mr.
barchi,
this
court
said,
was
denied
due
process
because
the
deprivation
had
finally
occurred
before
the
hearing
occurred,
and
in
this
particular
situation
the
deprivation
occurred
and
is
completed
before
the
hearing
is
decided
as
well.
moving--
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
--that
i
liked?
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
well,
i
think
it's
a
twofold
problem.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
well--
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
--it
is
our
position,
justice
marshall,
that
had
the
hearing
been
convened,
and
given
the
total
lack
of
pre-deprivation
procedures,
that
we
needed
to
be
afforded
the
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross
examine
witnesses,
but
the
problem
in
arguing
that
past
point
in
this
context
is,
it
was...
we
were
never
going
to
have
a
hearing
at
all.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
justice
marhsall,
we
did
not
refuse
to
participate,
as
you
put
it,
until
it
was
made
clear
to
us
by
the
fdic--
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
--well,
in
lieu
of
having
a
hearing
on
the
20th
of
february
we
did
file
in
federal
district
court
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
i
suppose
in
that
regard
we
were
refusing
to
participate.
when
the
federal
district
court
judge
agreed
with
us
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
the
fdic
suggested
an
alternative
hearing
schedule
to
him
which
still
would
have
been
well
beyond
mr.
mallen's
criminal
trial,
and
the
federal
district
court
judge
told
the
fdic
that
he
felt
that
was
too
little
too
late.
in
all
candor,
we
did
agree
with
the
federal
district
court
judge.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
yes.
however,
had
we
ever
at
any
time
been
afforded
the
opportunity
for
a
hearing
and
decision
that
would
have
been
over
before
his
criminal
trial
was
over,
we
would
have
accepted
it.
if
you
look
at
the
correspondence
in
the
appendix,
that
is
all
we
kept
asking
for
and
we
were
consistently
denied
it.
you
will
find
a
letter
in
there
from
the
regional
counsel
of
the
fdic
in
kansas
city
who
made
very
clear
and
very
pointedly
that
we
will
get
the
minimum
requirements
of
the
statute
and
no
more,
either
in
when
the
hearing
occurs
or
the
nature
of
the
hearing.
we
are
consistently
told
here
that
the
fdic
doesn't
have
a
habit
of
stringing
these
hearings
out
and
doesn't
have
a
habit
of
denying
an
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross
examine
witnesses,
but
in
support
for
that
proposition
you
have
no
facts.
mr.
mallen's
experience
and
the
letter
from
the
fdic's
attorney
certainly
stands
in
opposition
to
that
assertion,
and
on
the
one
time
when
a
fact
was
provided
it
was
a
citation
to
a
case
concerning
the
office
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
which
has
no
more
to
do
with
the
administrative
procedures
of
the
fdic
than
it
does
the
department
of
commerce.
mr.
mallen's
experience
as
far
as
the
record
before
this
court
goes
and
any
other
facts
notwithstanding,
is
the
norm.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
do
i
think
the
case
is
moot?
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
yes,
i
understand.
i
understand.
i
was
asked
how
i
was
going
to
handle
this--
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
--i
didn't
write
it.
yes,
i
do.
the
12
u.s.c.
1824,
which
is
the
statute
that
removes
mr.
mallen
upon
indictment,
notwithstanding
appeal,
is
broader
than
8(g)
in
that
it
removes
him
not
just
from
the
bank
in
kanawha
but
from
any
bank
whose
deposits
are
insured.
it
is
narrower
than
8(g)
in
another
respect.
it
removes
him
only
from
his
position
as
an
officer,
director,
and
employee
of
the
bank.
it
does
not
prohibit
him
voting
his
stock
in
the
bank
or
its
parent
holding
company.
8(g)
contains
a
restriction
on
participation
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
bank,
and
that
is
interpreted
to
mean
a
restriction
on
voting
stock.
in
that
one
regard,
notwithstanding
mr.
mallen's
removal
pursuant
to
12
u.s.c.
1829,
mr.
mallen...
8(g)
does
continue
to
impact
upon
him
in
this
one
area
having
to
do
with
the
voting
of
his
stock
in
the
bank
and
the
parent
bank
holding
company.
that
also
i
would
offer
as
some
suggestion
concerning
mootness.
mr.
mallen
and
the
shareholders
of
the
bank
have
taken
an
appeal
from
the
closing
of
the
institution,
which
is
pending
in
federal
court...
excuse
me,
state
court
in
iowa.
should
the
state
court
determine
that
the
closing
of
the
institutions
violated
state
law,
that
would
in
turn
impact
upon
the
mootness
of
this
case
as
well.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
your
honor,
i
was
a
partner
at
lindquist
and
venom.
i
left
and
opened
my
own
firm
approximately
five
months
ago.
mr.
mallen
is
now
represented
by
my
firm.
ms.
mary
e.
curtin
yes,
i
was,
your
honor.
unless
anyone
has
any
further
questions.
