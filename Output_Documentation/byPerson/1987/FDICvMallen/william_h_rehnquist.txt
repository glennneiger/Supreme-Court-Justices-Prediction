chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
87-82,
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
versus
james
e.
mallen.
mr.
harrison,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
take
it
what
you
mean
in
answer
to
that
question
is,
after
the
direct
appeal
in
the
criminal
proceeding
becomes
final,
not
after
the
eighth
circuit
rules,
but
after
a
petition
for
rehearing
time,
petition
for
certiorari
time
has
gone
by.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
of
course,
as
was
suggested
earlier
from
the
bench,
we
will
never
know
in
this
case
whether
the
agency
would
have
allowed
him
to
produce
oral
testimony
because
he
didn't
allow
it
to
come
to
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
harrison.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
curtin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
let's
assume
that's
correct,
but
why
should
the
district
court
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional?
if
it
is
his
view
that
under
these
circumstances
the
fdic
operating
under
the
statute
did
not
give
your
client
a
timely
hearing,
why
shouldn't
he
simply
say
the
statute
cannot
constitutionally
be
applied
in
this
manner?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
district
court's
ruling
coupling
his
reservations
about
the
timeliness
with
the
fact
that
the
fdic
would
not
automatically
have
admitted
oral
testimony?
surely
there
he
would
have
been
better
advised
to
wait
and
see
what
happened
at
the
hearing,
would
he
not?
i
mean,
this
is
not
a
first
amendment
case.
we
just
don't
ordinarily
have
facial
attacks
on
this
kind
of
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
curtin.
mr.
harrison,
you
have
14
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
harrison.
the
case
is
submitted.
