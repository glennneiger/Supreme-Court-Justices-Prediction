justice

mr.
harrison,
why
are
we
examining
this
thing
in
gross?
this
is
a
facial
challenge
that
we
have,
right?
justice
scalia
why
is
that?
as
i
understand
it,
he
didn't
go
through
the
whole
process
anyway,
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
government
would
have
given
him
his
hearing
within
17
days
or
something
like
that.
justice
scalia
well,
is
it
the
government's
position...
that
it
is
proper
to
attack
the
statute
on
its
face
in
those
circumstances?
justice
scalia
that
is
not
what
i
asked,
though.
justice
scalia
that
is
still
not
what
i
asked.
is
this
a
proper
facial
challenge?
why
shouldn't
we
say
as
far
as
we
can
tell
there
is
no
assurance
here
that
this
individual
would
have
been
deprived
of
due
process,
even
accepting
his
contentions
as
to
what
due
process
requires?
justice
scalia
mr.
harrison,
are
you
sure
a
bank
wouldn't
be
in
trouble
with
its
shareholders
or
indeed
perhaps
even
with
federal
regulatory
authorities
if
it
continued
to
pay
an
officer
who
was
not
performing
any
services?
i
mean,
you
say
the
statute
doesn't
require
that
his
pay
be
cut
off,
but
why
in
the
world
should
a
bank
continue
to
pay
somebody
who
is
unable
to
perform?
justice
scalia
i
would
think.
justice
scalia
can
i
ask
you
just...
what
does
the
government
decide
in
these
cases?
what
is
it
looking
for
at
this
hearing?
does
the
degree
of
probability
of
guilt
of
the
matter
on
which
he
has
been
indicted
have
anything
to
do
with
the
determination?
justice
scalia
it
wasn't
mr.
harrison
down
there,
though,
was
it,
anyway?
justice
scalia
that's
nice.

justice

ms.
curtin,
you
say
the
risk
is
high.
my
own
guess
would
be
that
the
risk
is
pretty
small
if
indeed
it
is
very
unlikely
that
in
most...
it
is
very
unlikely
that
confidence
wouldn't
be
affected,
but
why
is
it
that
you
establish
the
criminal
trial
as
somehow
the
date
by
which
a
hearing
has
to
be
afforded.
isn't
it
reasonable
for
congress
to
say,
look,
we
think...
we
think
you
ought
to
give
this
individual
a
hearing
within
90
days,
you
ought
to
have
his
answer
within
90
days.
if
you
are
doing
this...
this
suspension
longer
than
that,
there
is
injustice.
and
they
have
done
that
here.
they
are
willing
to
give
it
within
90
days.
why
does
the
trial
have
to
be
somehow
the
trigger
for
some
expedited--
justice
scalia
--i
understand,
but
congress
would
be
saying,
fine,
so
much
the
better.
if
the
trial
is
over
with
in
90
days,
then
there
is
no
problem.
if
the
trial
isn't
over
within
90
days
we
want
to
be
sure
that
the
fellow
has
a
hearing.
it
all
makes
sense.
you
are
really
arguing
that
90
days
is
just
an
inordinately
long
period.
don't
you
have
to
carry
that--
justice
scalia
--i
suppose
that
that
would
be
a
good
argument
if
it
were
clear
that
congress
could
not
absolutely
automatically
eliminate
officerships
when
there
is
an
indictment.
justice
scalia
i
agree
with
all
of
that,
but
it
still
seems
to
me
reasonable
for
the
legislature
to
say
there
must
be
some
kind
of
hearing,
and
this
has
to
be
done
within
90
days.
now,
if
the
trial
occurs
before
that
and
takes
care
of
everything,
fine.
isn't
that
a
rationale
and
fair
system?
justice
scalia
so
long
as
you
assume
that
congress
could
have
eliminated
him
without
a
hearing
and
just
said
everybody
who
is
indicted
gets
down
as
an
officer
of
a
bank.
justice
scalia
yes,
i
understand
that.
