mr.
john
c.
harrison
thank
you,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
iowa.
the
district
court
held
unconstitutional
12
u.s.c.
1818(g)
and
enjoined
the
fdic
from
enforcing
it
against
appellee
mallen.
under
section
1818(g),
when
an
officer
of
a
federally
insured
bank
is
indicted
for
a
felony
involving
dishonesty
or
breach
of
trust,
the
appropriate
federal
banking
agency,
in
the
case
of
this
bank
the
fdic,
may
suspend
him
from
office
and
order
him
not
to
participate
further
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
bank
pending
the
resolution
of
the
criminal
charges
if
it
determines
that
his
continued
service
would
pose
a
threat
to
the
interests
of
depositors
or
threaten
to
impair
public
confidence
in
the
bank.
if
a
conviction
becomes
final
the
suspension
ends
and
the
officer
is
then
subject
to
permanent
removal.
because
of
the
risks
posed
to
the
bank
and
to
public
confidence
by
the
presence
there
of
an
officer
who
has
been
indicated,
the
fdic
may
under
the
statute
impose
a
suspension
immediately,
as
soon
as
the
indictment
is
authorized.
once
the
suspension
has
been
ordered,
the
statute
gives
the
suspended
officer
the
right
to
request
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
the
agency
and
to
show
that
his
return
to
the
bank
would
not
threaten
the
interests
that
the
statute
seeks
to
protect.
if
he
makes
that
request,
his
opportunity
to
appear
must
be
given
him
within
30
days,
and
then
once
he
has
had
the
opportunity
to
be
heard,
the
agency
must
decide
within
60
days
whether
or
not
to
terminate,
modify,
or
continue
the
suspension.
when
he
makes
his
appearance
before
the
agency,
the
officer
may
submit
written
material
and
oral
argument,
and
in
the
discretion
of
the
agency,
oral
evidence.
the
district
court
found
that
the
suspension
procedures
that
i
have
just
outlined
were
unconstitutional
and
enjoined
the
fdic
from
enforcing
them
because
of
the
90-day
time
period
that
is
allowed
for
the
agency's
decision
after
the
suspension
is
ordered
and
because
the
agency
has
discretion
as
to
whether
to
accept
oral
testimony.
neither
ground
of
decision
was
correct.
congress
in
fixing
the
time
limits
for
the
hearing
and
for
the
decision
after
the
hearing
had
to
accommodate
the
competing
interests,
here
the
suspended
officer's
interest
in
having
a
prompt
disposition
of
his
possible
return
to
the
bank
and
the
public
interest
in
making
sure
that
the
indicted
officer
is
not
returned
to
the
bank
until
the
<fdic>
[=
fdic]
has
had
a
chance
to
satisfy
itself
that
it
would
be
safe
to
do
so
because,
of
course,
he
has
been
indicted.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
the
district
judge
was
judge
o'brien.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
the
hearing
had
been
scheduled
for
a
date
19
days
after
he
requested
it.
it
never
was
held
because
it
was
enjoined,
the
entire
process
was
enjoined
by
the
district
court
the
day
before
the
hearing
would
have
been
held,
so
we
don't
know
how
long
it
would
have
taken
the
agency
to
decide
the
case.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
we
think
that
the
statute
clearly
survives
a
facial
challenge.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
and
that
it
is
unusual
for
the
district
court
to
decide
that
the
statutory
process
is
completely
meaningless,
that
it
does
not
provide
meaningful
review
because
of
the
time
that
is
permitted
by
the
statute.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
that
would
be
a
sound
ground
for
decision,
yes.
the
district
court
should
not
have
reached
the
question
until
it
had
seen
what
the
agency
would
have
done
and
would
have
determined
whether
he
would
have
had
a
hearing
that
would
have
taken
place
within
a
time
period
that
the
district
court
would
have
regarded--
mr.
john
c.
harrison
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
it
is.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
it
has
not.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
once
the
criminal
process
for
mallen
is
exhausted
the
case
may
become
moot.
it
is
not
entirely
clear
whether
it
does
because
of
the
possible
relationship
between
the
suspension
proceedings
and
any
future
removal
proceedings
which
can
also
be
instituted
under
section
1818(g),
but
the
case
might
well
be
moot
after
a
decision
in
the
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
yes,
that's
right.
once
the
judgment
becomes
final.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
yes,
we
did.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
that's
right.
so
the
case
may
go
on
for
a
while.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
it
was
argued
in
december
in
the
eighth
circuit,
and
as
far
as
i
know
it
is
not
being
held
pending
resolution
of
this
case.
the
balancing
of
interests
that
the
due
process
clause
requires,
we
feel,
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
90-day
period
that
congress
allowed
is
a
sensible
amount
of
time.
the
public
interest
is
very
heavy,
and
of
course,
although
mallen's
interest
is
significant,
it
is
outweighed
by
the
need
to
protect
the
banking
system.
the
30-day
period
that
is
permitted--
mr.
john
c.
harrison
--no,
the
statute
does
not
provide
that
the
suspension
is
without
pay.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
i
believe
while
the
bank
was
open
the
bank
continued
to
pay
him,
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
statute
to
prevent
that.
the
30
days
gives
the
fdic
the
opportunity
in
a
case
where
it
knows
nothing
more
than
what
it
knew
from
the
indictment
to
investigate
the
situation
to
be
prepared
to
answer
whatever
showing
the
officer
is
expected
to
make.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
well,
he
has
served
his
sentence
and
is
currently
on
probation.
the
bank
is
now
closed.
the
iowa
banking
authority
closed--
mr.
john
c.
harrison
--because
it
became
insolvent,
so
he
is
no
longer
employed
there
anyway,
but...
and...
and
he
wouldn't
be
employed
by
the
bank
because
of
a
different
statute.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
it
is
entirely
possible
that
either
the
bank
shareholders
or
management
or
state
or
federal
regulatory
authorities
might
object
to
paying
a
suspended
officer.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
yes,
that's
true.
in
addition
to
investigating
the
situation
in
the
30-day
period,
of
course,
the
fdic
has
to
set
up
the
hearing,
it
has
to
schedule
its
witnesses,
usually
bank
examiners,
whose
schedules
may
be
difficult
to
adjust.
it
has
to
find
an
officer
to
conduct
the
hearing.
once
the
hearing
has
been
held,
the
fdic
has
up
to
60
days
to
make
its
decision.
now,
some
of
that
time
will
be
consumed
with
administrative
steps.
the
hearing
officer
will
prepare
his
proposed
disposition.
it
will
be
reviewed
in
various
parts
of
the
fdic.
but
the
primary
justification
for
giving
the
fdic
as
much
as
60
days
to
make
its
decision
as
to
whether
to
return
the
officer
once
he
has
been
indicted
to
the
bank
is
the
danger
of
sending
him
back
and
the
fact
that
in
the
most
difficult
case
the
fdic
may
have
a
hard
choice
to
make.
the
fdic
and
the
system
of
banking
regulation
exists
to
protect
the
public,
to
protect
depositors,
the
public
in
general,
and
in
particular
can
continue
because
there
is
general
public
confidence
in
the
banking.
that
is
what
makes
possible
the
banking
system.
that
is
what
makes
possible
the
fdic's
deposit
insurance
system.
so
it
is
extremely
important
that
the
fdic
be
very
sure
that
it
is
doing
the
right
thing
if
it
is
going
to
let
the
officer
go
back
to
the
bank.
on
the
other
hand,
the
officer
in
the
most
difficult
case
may
have
made
a
strong
showing
that
there
are
unique
facts
explaining
why
despite
the
indictment
which
normally
would
lead
him
to
be
suspended
it
would
be
safe
in
that
particular
case
for
him
to
go
back
to
the
bank.
thus
the
fdic
in
the
case
in
which
the
statute
has
to
be
judged
on
a
facial
challenge
will
have
to
be
making
a
decision
that
is
hard
to
make,
a
difficult
decision,
and
in
which
the
down
side
risk
is
very
serious
of
letting
the
officer
go
back.
sixty
days
is,
as
this
court
recognized
in
cases
like
thirty-seven
photographs,
an
expedited
time
period
within
which
to
make
a
decision
anyway,
and
so
it
was,
we
think,
quite
unsound
for
the
district
court
to
suggest
that
congress
acted
unreasonably
in
saying
that
the
fdic
could
have
as
much
as
60
days
if
it
needed
it,
and
of
course,
as
has
been
suggested,
we
do
not
know
how
long
it
would
have
taken
to
make
the
decision
as
to
mallen.
now,
the
district
court
did
not
decide
that
90
days
was
an
unreasonable
period
of
time
because
it
thought
that
the
balance
between
the
competing
interests
shifted
in
favor
of
mallen
or
because
it
just
couldn't
see
a
reason
to
need
90
days
to
have
the
hearing
and
then
make
the
decision.
rather,
it
analogized
the
case,
unsoundly,
we
think,
to
this
court's
decision
in
barry
against
barchi.
in
barry,
a
horse
trainer
had
been
suspended
for
allegedly
drugging
a
horse.
the
suspension
was
a
penal
suspension
imposed
for
15
days,
and
it
ended
after
15
days.
the
state
racing
commission
had
30
days
within
which
to
hold
its
hearing
on
the
suspended
trainer
to
decide
whether
to...
not
to
impose
the
suspension,
and
then
there
was
no
set
time
period
for
it
to
make
its
decision.
so
the
way
the
system
was
set
up
in
barry
against
barchi,
it
was
possible
that
a
penal
suspension
would
end
on
its
own,
would
terminate
automatically
before
any
hearing
was
held,
but
the
analogy
does
not
hold
up.
what
the
district
court
thought
was
that
since
the
criminal
process
might
make
its
decision
and
thus
determine
whether
or
not
mallen
could
go
back
to
the
bank
before
the
fdic
had
a
chance
to
hold
its
hearing
and
make
its
decision
under
1818(g),
that
somehow
rendered
the
section
1818(g)
process
meaningless,
but
the
difference
between
the
cases
is
that
here
mallen
receives
review
of
the
fdic's
decision
to
suspend
through
both
the
processes.
either
one
can
bring
the
suspension
to
an
end.
if
he
is
acquitted,
of
course,
the
suspension
terminates.
if
the
fdic
on
the
basis
of
his
showing
decides
that,
yes,
this
is
an
unusual
case
in
which
it
would
be
safe
to
allow
him
to
come
back
to
the
bank,
the
decision
terminates,
but
review
is
not
cut
off.
the
situation
is
not
at
all
like
barry
against
barchi.
also,
of
course,
the
district
court's
empirical
assumption
that
as
a
general
rule
the
criminal
process
would
terminate
the
suspension
before
the
fdic
process
did,
which
was
based
on
the
district
court's
thinking
that
the
suspension
only
ran
until
jury
verdict
rather
than
until
the
end
of
the
criminal
process
was
simply
incorrect.
as
we
have
seen,
as
we
were
discussing
a
moment
ago,
the
criminal
process
is
still
going
on
now,
and
indeed
it
is
possible
if
the
united
states
prevails
on
its
appeal
that
there
will
have
to
be
another
trial,
and
so
the...
i
am
sorry.
if
the
united
states
prevails
on
its
appeal
the
jury
verdict
will
be
reinstated.
i
apologize.
that
means
that
my
earlier
answer
was
incorrect.
in
any
event,
it
has
now
been
more
than
a
year
since
mallen
was
suspended,
and
the
criminal
process
is
still
going
on.
the
district
court
also
held
that
the
hearing
that
is
provided
under
section
1818(g)
is
not
a
meaningful
process,
is
not
meaningful
review
because
the
agency
has
discretion,
and
in
this
case
the
discretion
is
delegated
to
a
hearing
officer
to
decide
whether
to
allow
mallen
to
introduce
oral
evidence,
testimony
in
addition
to
the
written
materials
and
the
oral
argument
that
he
has
a
statutory
right
to
introduce.
now,
this
court
has
never
held
that
as
a
general
matter
due
process
creates
a
right
to
testify,
to
put
on
evidence,
to
put
on
oral
evidence
as
opposed
to
a
right
to
be
heard,
and
mallen,
of
course,
has
a
right
fully
to
be
heard
to
present
the
written
statements
of
any
individuals
whose
testimony
he
thinks
would
be
relevant.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
that
is
entirely
correct.
it
is
the
general
practice
of
these
hearings
for
oral
testimony
to
be
taken
from
both
sides
and
for
cross
examination
to
be
conducted.
the
district
court
issued
its
injunction
the
day
before
the
hearing
was
going
to
be
held,
presumably
the
day
before,
therefore,
the
hearing
officer
would
have
decided
whether
or
not
he
was
going
to
admit
oral
testimony.
at
the
very
least
it
would
have
been
appropriate
if
this
is
what
concerned
the
district
court
for
the
district
court
to
wait
and
see
what
had
happened,
to
wait
and
see
if
there
had
been
any
deprivation
of
the
kind
of
hearing
that
the
court
thought
was
constitutionally
required,
or
if
that
was
not
enough,
at
least
to
order
the
hearing,
if
the
court
thought
it
was
necessary
for
some
reason
to
decide
the
issue
before
it
had
seen
what
the
agency
was
going
to
do,
to
order
that
oral
evidence
be
accepted,
but
certainly
not
to
decide
the
case
the
way
the
district
court
did,
which
was
simply
to
strike
down
the
statute,
to
reach
out
to
find
it
unconstitutional
on
the
basis
of
something
that
might
never
have
happened,
but
it
didn't
know
whether
it
was
going
to
happen,
and
that
in
any
event
could
have
been
cured.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
absolutely
not.
the
only
questions
that
the
fdic
considers
have
to
do
with
banking
regulations,
have
to
do
with
the
protection
of
the
interests
of
depositors
and
the
threat
to
public
confidence
that
is
posed
by
having
an
indicted
officer
serving
at
the
bank.
then
the
fdic
is
looking
in
hearing
the
officer
on
his
opportunity
to
respond,
is
looking
for
the
officer
to
give
some
reason
why,
despite
the
normal
expectation
that
is
created
in
an
indictment
that
congress
thought
would
make
suspensions
after
indictment
virtually
routine,
for
some
showing
of
some
unique
situation
that
prevails
in
that
particular
bank,
why
there
is
extremely
heavy
supervision
of
the
officer,
for
example.
i
don't
know
what
all.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
since
the
1978
amendments
that
are
under
consideration
in
this
case,
i
believe
it
has
not.
there
may
have
been
at
least
one
case
under
the
old
version
of
section
1818(g)
when
someone
was
indicted
and
not
suspended,
but
it
is,
as
congress
thought
it
would
be,
virtually
routine
to
suspend
an
indicted
officer.
thank
you.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
thank
you,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
first,
the
suspension
that
is
imposed
under
section
1818(g)
is
not
a
penalty.
it
is
a
preventive
measure
to
get
an
indicted
officer
out
of
the
bank
while
the
criminal
process
is
under
way
to
protect
the
shareholders
and
to
protect
public
confidence.
there
are
two
ways
in
which
the
indicted
officer
can
get
back
into
the
bank.
he
can
be
acquitted,
or
the
fdic
through
the
fdic
process
can
decide
that
it
is
in
fact
safe
for
him
to
go
back.
mr.
john
c.
harrison
that
is
under
a
different--
mr.
john
c.
harrison
--that's
true.
i'm
sorry.
the
suspension
would
be
over,
however,
and
there
are
two
process
processes
that
can
end
the
suspension,
but
the
suspension
continues
until
one
of
them...
quite
reasonably
continues
until
one
of
them
decides
that
the
suspension
can
come
to
an
end,
and
the
suggestion
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
hearing
on
all
the
possible
issues,
that
every
way
in
which
the
suspension
could
be
brought
to
an
end
has
to
be
decided
for
there
to
be
meaningful
process,
is
just
not
correct.
what
mallen
is
suggesting
is
that
it
is
very
important
for
the
fdic's
decision
to
be
reconsidered
rather
than
some
other
way
of
ending
the
suspension
to
take
effect,
and
that
is
just
not
sound.
as
ms.
curtin
explained
in
explaining
why
this
case
is
not
moot,
section
1818(g)
has
significant
consequences
that
section
1829
does
not.
we
agree
that
the
section
1829
bar
attaches
as
soon
as
a
judgment
of
conviction
is
entered
in
the
district
court.
that
does
not
end
the
section
1818(g)
suspension
and
it
does
not
make
the
section
1818(g)
suspension
unimportant.
in
particular
under
section
1818(g),
as
ms.
curtin
explained,
the
indicted
officer
can't
participate
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
bank.
in
mallen's
case
that
meant
that
he
couldn't
act
as
the
controlling
shareholder
of
the
holding
company
that
ran
the
bank.
obviously,
it
may
be
extremely
important
to
get
the
dominant
figure
out
of
the
bank
pending
the
resolution
to
criminal
charges,
and
it
is
just
as
important
to
get
him
out
of
his
position
of
control
from
which
he
can
direct
what
the
bank
does
as
it
actually
to
stop
him
being
an
officer
or
director.
so,
section
1818(g)
not
only
has
a
consequence
that
section
1829
doesn't
have
that
continues
past
conviction
in
the
district
court,
but
a
very
important
consequence,
and
one
that
in
this
case
was
very
important
until
the
bank
was
closed.
now,
even
after
the
bank
has
been
closed,
section
1818(g)
has
collateral
consequences,
as
we
explain
in
footnotes
10
and
12
of
our
main
brief
and
footnote
2
of
our
reply
brief
that
keep
the
case
alive
and
not
moot,
but
not
only...
the
bank
is
open.
not
only
is
it
not
moot,
it
is
really
very
important.
also,
the
discussion
that
ms.
curtin
gave
of
the
need
for
larger
and
more
rapid
post-suspension
proceedings
ignores
the
fact
that
the
fdic
is
proceeding
into
the
suspension
on
the
basis
of
the
indictment,
and
acts
as
if
when
the
indictment
is
entered
that
is
just
the
trigger
for
the
fdic
to
inquire
into
whether
it
would
be
safe
for
the
indicted
officer
to
remain
at
the
bank,
but
the
premise
of
the
statute
is
that
the
indictment
creates
a
danger
and
that
that's
the
mean
reason
that
the
fdic
imposes
the
suspension,
and
the
suggestion
that
there
is
a
lot
to
be
asked
about
about
what
other
grounds
the
fdic
may
have
had
for
thinking
that
the
indictment
creates
a
threat
to
the
interests
of
depositors
or
a
threat
to
public
confidence
is
just
not
persuasive,
and
in
this
case
mallen
obviously
knew
why
he
had
been
indicted,
and
in
fact
knew
a
great
deal
about
the
fdic's
reservations
about
his
conduct
at
the
bank.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
