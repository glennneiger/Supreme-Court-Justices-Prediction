justice
white
and
the
united
states
appealed,
too,
didn't
it?
justice
white
and
if
dismissal
of
that
count
is
reversed,
there
may
be
another
trial.
justice
white
--what
happens
if
the
criminal
conviction
becomes
final?
where
does
he
stand
then?
i
know
he
is
probably
in
jail,
but
how
about
his
pay
then?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
has
it
ever...
an
officer
unsuspended?
justice
white
well,
outside
of
the
first
amendment
area,
if
a
statute
is
to
be
held
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
wouldn't
it
be
true
that
it
could
never
be
any
circumstances
constitutionally
applied?
justice
white
well,
you
certainly
must...
you
certainly
must
concede
that
the
statute
could
be
constitutionally
applied.
justice
white
well,
if
the
agency
here
had
given
your
client
a
hearing
within
two
days
and
decided
the
case
within
two
more
days,
i
would
doubt
if
you
would
have
had
much
objection
to
that,
would
you?
justice
white
i
take
it,
though,
you
originally
asked
for
a
pre-suspension
hearing,
didn't
you?
justice
white
you
never
did?
justice
white
the
court
said
that
the
agency
didn't
need
to
have
a
pre-suspension
hearing.
justice
white
hadn't
the
fdic
started
a
hearing
to
remove
him
under
another
section?
justice
white
several
months
before
indictment?
justice
white
and
there
was
a
hearing.
it
went
on
before
an
administrative
law
judge?
justice
white
did
your
client
testify?
justice
white
the
hearing
was
never
concluded?
justice
white
there
was
an
indictment
there.
justice
white
so
the
fdic
did
know
something
about
the
bank.
justice
white
well,
it
was
to
see
whether
he
should
be
removed.
justice
white
right.
yes.
justice
white
ms.
curtin,
do
you
think
the
case
is
moot?
justice
white
mr.
mallen
filed
a
suggestion
of
mootness
some
months
ago.
justice
white
do
you
back
off
of
that
suggestion?
justice
white
well,
if
he
were
acquitted
he
wouldn't
necessarily
be
entitlted
to
return
to
the
bank.
the
fdic
might
still
remove
him.
justice
white
well,
nevertheless,
he
wouldn't
be
automatically
entitled
to
go
back.
