justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
aren't
you
overlooking
something?
if
he
comes
back
in
and
says
please
sentence
me
again,
is
it
not
possible
that
he
could
get
a
longer
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
a
lawyer
would
advise
him
to
come
back,
saying
i
realize
you've
served
your
sentence,
but
if
you
take
a
shot
at
getting
the
whole
thing
expunged,
of
course,
you
might
have
to
spend
another
year
in
jail,
but
what
do
you
want
to
do?
can
you
imagine
a
lawyer
asking
for
that
risk,
after
he's
served
his
sentence,
to
go
back
in
and
take
a
chance
at
getting
exposed
to
another
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
benefit
can
you
get
out
of
winning
this
case,
except
an
opinion
that
you
would
like?
i
understand
the
rule
of
law
would
be
something
that
interests
you.
but
as
far
as
your
fight
with
this
defendant,
what
are
you
going
to
get
that
you
haven't
already
gotten?
justice
john
paul
stevens
will
you
ask
for
a
more
severe
sentence
if
he
comes
back?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
don't,
you
don't
have
any
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you...
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
your
argument
on
the
merits,
but
is
it
correct,
the
respondent
had
already
served
his
sentence
at
the
time
the
case
was
decided
by
the
vermont
supreme
court?
i
noticed
their
decision
was
in
1986,
which
it
seems
to
be
about
three
years
after
the
sentencing
date.
justice
john
paul
stevens
his
sentence
was
eighteen
months,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
was
sentenced
in
1983,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
january
of
'84.
so,
then,
by
october
of
'86,
he
would
have
served
his
sentence.
does
the
vermont
supreme
court
have
jurisdiction
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
render
advisory
opinion
or
do
they
have
the
same
kind
of
doctrine
we
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
larkin,
would
you
defend
a
rule
that
said
that
we
will
have
these
interviews
for
a
person's
presentence
report
without
counsel
only
and
if
the
defendant
wants
counsel,
he
can't
have
the
interview?
would
that
be
a
permissible
rule?
just
as
a
general
state
policy.
the
only
way
they
will
have
them
is
without
counsel,
it's
up
to
the
defendant
to
decide
whether
to
take
advantage
of
it
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's,
in
effect,
what
happened
here
because
he
had
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
she
said...
you
acknowledge
it's
the
equivalent
of
asking
for
a
lawyer,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
considered
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
a
lawyer
at
an
interview
of
this
kind,
basically?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
he
would
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
a
lawyer
present?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
either
go
ahead
without
the
lawyer
or
you
don't
have
it.
why
isn't
that
circumventing
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
present?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
have
a
pre-sentence
interview
with
the
lawyer
present.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
at
any
other
time
because
she
said
it's
either
now
or
never.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
this
case.
you
can
either
forego
the
interview
or...
you
can
either
forego
a
lawyer
or
the
interview,
can't
have
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
thought
you
said
you
agreed
this
was
a
critical
stage
of
the
prosecution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
defending
the
state's
right
to
say
we
can
force
you
to
go
through
the
critical
stage
of
the
prosecution.
if
you
want
to
have
the
benefit
of
a
critical
stage
of
the
prosecution,
you
must
have
it
without
a
lawyer
present.
that's
what
you're
saying.
this
isn't
a
required
interview.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
it
was
a
trial,
he
wanted
to
put
on
his
defense,
he
says
my
lawyer
isn't
here
yet,
the
judge
said
you
either
put
on
your
defense
by
yourself
or
you
can't
put
on
a
defense,
would
that
be
a
fair
choice
for
a
critical
stage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
an
even
more
critical
stage.
that's
the
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hinton,
let
me
ask
you
a
variation
of
these
questions.
supposing
he
were
to
call
you
up
and
say
i've
got
lots
of
money
now,
so
i
don't
have
to
have
public
counsel,
how
much
would
it
be
worth
to
me
to
hire
a
lawyer
to
defend
this
judgment,
what
would
you
tell
him?
nickel,
dime,
quarter.
how
much
interest
does
he
have
in
the
outcome
of
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
doesn't
have
any,
does
he?
there's
no
way
in
the
world
he'd
go
back
in
and
say
i
want
to
get
re-sentenced,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
certainly
would
not
pay
a
lawyer
a
usual
and
customary
rate
to
argue
this
case
for
him,
would
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
told
me
that
if
he
came
back,
he
wouldn't
ask
for
anything
anyway.
he'd
be
foolish
to
ask
for
anything
under
the
order.
if
he
asked
for
your
advice,
you'd
tell
him
to
stay
home,
wouldn't
you?
