justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
why
we
don't
have
any
brief
on
his
behalf,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
there's
no
brief
of
his,
is
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
had
fully
served
his
prison
term,
had
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
was
released?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
he's
disappeared.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
you
get
him
back
here
if
he
served,
fully
served
his
prison
sentence?
has
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
after
he's
fully
served
the
sentence
that
was
initially
imposed,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
they
can
bring
him
back
for
resentencing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he's
the
one
that
has
to
initiate
taking
advantage
of
that
option,
doesn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
are
you
going
to
return
him?
how
can
you
force
his
return?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he's
outside
of
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
it?
he
served
his
term.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
still
don't
understand.
how
can
you
force
him
back
to
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
were.
he'd
be
a
wise
man
to
return,
wouldn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
we
didn't
have
his
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
the
respondent
himself,
the
now-missing
defendant,--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
argued
the
case
in
the
vermont
court--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--well,
was
your
office,
what
is
it,
the--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--yes.
was
that
in
at
the
trial
stage?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
it
represent
him
at
the
time
of
this
interview
with
the
probation
officer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
don't
know
whether
or
not
they
advised
him
to
act
as
he
did
when
he
submitted--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--tell
me,
you
were
not
amicus
in
the
vermont
supreme
court,
were
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
can't
find
him
because
he
served
his
sentence
and
he
beat
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
it
be
good
sense
for
him
to
come
back
to
vermont
after
he
served
his
sentence?
