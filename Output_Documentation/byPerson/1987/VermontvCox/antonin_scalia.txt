the
difference
there,
i
take
it,
is
that
you
would
say
you
have
to
give
the
man
a
trial.
you
don't
have
to
give
him
this
opportunity.
if
you
give
it
to
him,
it's
critical,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
law
that
requires
you
to
give
him
this
allocution.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
the
failure
or
the
refusal
to
go
ahead
without
a
lawyer,
you
say,
if
it
violates
anything,
doesn't
violate
the
sixth
amendment
but
some
right
to
having
that
interview--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
as
in
the
trial
case
just
given,
if
there
were
any
violations,
what
you
would
have
been
deprived
of
was
not
your
right
to
a
lawyer
but
your
right
to
the
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
all
he
was
coerced
into
doing
was
attending
the
pre-sentence
interview,
right?
he
wasn't
coerced
into
saying
anything
that
would
be
against
his
penal
interests,
was
he?
he
could
have
attended
the
interview
and
only
said
nice
things
about
himself,
couldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
any
coercion
to
provide
any
incriminating
statements
about
himself?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
relates
to
the
counsel
violation,
which
is
a
different
one.
i
mean,
i
understand
that
had
counsel
been
present,
he
might
not
have
answered
some
questions
the
way
he
did
answer
them.
but,
still
and
all,
he
was
not...
there
was
no
coercion
for
him
to
make
any
incriminating
statements.
there
was
only
coercion
for
him
to
go
to
the
pre-sentence
interview.
isn't
that
an
accurate
statement?
justice
antonin
scalia
coercive
of
what?
coercive
of
his
going
to
the
interview?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
could
have
gone
to
the
interview
and
said,
you
know,
just
nice
good
things.
was
there
any
coercion
for
him
to
make
an
incriminating
statement
or
to
provide
evidence
against
himself?
justice
antonin
scalia
then,
why
did
you
press
his
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
vermont
once
he
had
served
his
sentence?
i
gather
he
had
served
his
sentence
before
that
case
was
argued.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
does
come
back,
though,
the
state
is,
on
this
decision
of
the
vermont
supreme
court,
bound
to
give
him
another
sentencing
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it's
entirely
up
to
him.
it's
conceivable
that
he
could
commit
another
crime
in
vermont,
be
prosecuted
under
a
repeat
offender
law,
at
which
point
it
would
be
very
much
in
his
interests
to
get
his
first
conviction
expunged.
