justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
want
to
have
to
go
about
complying
with
the
order,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
under
an
order,
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
want
to
have
to
comply?
they
can't
comply.
well,
i
know,
but
there's
the
order.
there
is
the
order.
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
extradite
him?
you
can't
extradite
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
he
on
parole,
by
any
chance?
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
been
released?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
going
to
tell
us
what
the
difference
is
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
merely
incriminating
himself
isn't
enough
to
make
a
fifth
amendment
case.
you've
got
to
have
some
compulsion.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
the
usual
arrest
and
interrogation
situation,
where
counsel
isn't
present,
the
impression
the
officers
give
is
that
we're
going
to
keep
you
here
till
you
answer,
and
that's
what
triggered
the
right
to
have
counsel
present.
but,
here,
it's
just
the
opposite,
if
you
don't
want
to
stay
here,
take
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
could
make
his
choice,
which
is
worse
for
him,
being
quiet
or
speaking,
and
that's
the
kind
of
choice
that
people
have
to
make
at
trial
all
the
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
vermont
supreme
court,
though,
went
to
the
fifth
amendment.
why
didn't
they
just
set
the
sentence
aside
as
violation
of
vermont
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
calls
you
up
and
says
can
i
come
back,
i
take
it
you
would
tell
him,
if
you
can
make
a
living
somewhere
else,
please
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
there's
still...
do
you
think
we
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
case?
do
you
think
there's
still
a
case
for
controversy
between
you
and
the
state?
is
the
case
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
technical
matter,
is
this
moot
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
just
dismiss
it
as
moot,
then
the
order
on
the
state
still
stands.
re-sentence
him.
it
may
be
that
they
still
have
to
contend
with
that
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
don't
think
it
means
very
much
as
a
practical
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
worry
about
it
now.
they've
got
an
order.
so,
you
don't
think...
technically,
is
it
moot
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mootness
is
technical
in
itself.
but
is
it
correct
that
if
he
doesn't
come
back,
the
state
doesn't
have
to
do
anything?
they
won't
be
in
contempt
of
any
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
object
to
if
the
state
said...
want
back
and
asked
to
be
relieved
from
that
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
on
the
ground
that
you
say
there's
nothing
to
the
case.
why
do
you
care
whether
the
order
is
outstanding
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
you
care
enough
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
then,
he
wouldn't
ask
for
anything,
but
if
he
came
back,
the
police
would...
the
state
would
pick
him
up,
pick
him
up
and
re-sentence
him
pursuant
to
this
order.
