ms.
susan
r.
harritt
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
cause
is
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
a
decision
of
the
vermont
supreme
court.
that
court
erroneously
held
that
this
respondent's
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
was
violated
by
the
state's
pre-sentence
investigative
process.
at
the
pre-sentence
investigation
interview,
where
the
respondent
was
given
the
choice
of
participation
or
not,
the
respondent
made
statements
that
the
judge
considered
at
the
later
sentencing
hearing.
the
vermont
supreme
court
also
committed
error
beyond
the
compulsion
decision
when
it
mistakenly
relied
on
estelle
v.
smith
and
held
that
the
respondent's
sentence
had
been
enhanced
despite
the
fact
that
respondent's
exposure
to
his
criminal
responsibility
remained
the
same
as
his
exposure
following
his
nolo
contendere
pleas.
the
state's
court's
decision
improperly
extended
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
on
these
facts
and
created
an
unwarranted
obstacle
to
the
individualized
sentencing
process.
turning
briefly
to
the
facts,
the
record
reveals
that
the
respondent
entered
three
pleas
of
nolo
contendere
at
a
change
of
plea
hearing,
at
which
time
the
court
ordered
a
presentence
investigation
report.
this
order
was
made
in
the
presence
of
counsel
and
respondent,
pursuant
to
vermont
practice.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
no,
the
record
doesn't
indicate
whether
or
not
the
respondent
was
told
by
the
court
or
the
probation
officer.
however,
the
purpose
of
the
interview
is
clearly
spelled
cut
in
both
criminal
rules
as
well
as
the
statutes
in
addition
to
vermont
practice.
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report,
in
fact,
follows
a
prescribed
format
that
is
known
to
all
practicing...
persons...
pardon
me...
practicing
criminal
law
and
certainly
since
the
attorney
for
respondent
was
a
public
defender,
the
format
was
not
a
surprise
to
her.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
no,
the
record
doesn't
reveal
notice
as
to
the
precise
time
when
the
interview
would
take
place.
however,
it's
clear
from
the
practice
in
vermont
that
the
interview
did
not
take
place
immediately
after
the
change
of
plea
hearing,
and,
so,
it
was,
therefore,
incumbent
on
defense
counsel
to
prepare
her
client
knowing
the
purpose
of
the
report
and
the
fact
that
the
admissions
of
the
defendant,
had
he
chose
to
submit
to
the
interview,
should
be
considered.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
at
this
juncture,
we
do
not,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
well,
you
have
a
brief
on
his
behalf
as
filed
by
the--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--i'm
not--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--yes.
he--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
well,
he's
left
the
jurisdiction.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
well,
we
submit
that
the
case--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--well,
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
we
don't
believe
the
case
is
dead.
the
order
of
the
court
below
indicated
that
the
decision
should
be
reversed,
sentencing
should
take
place
with
a
new
report
prepared,
and
with
the
prospect
of
new
sentencing,
the
respondent
faces
a
number
of
alternatives,
one
of
them
being
the
opportunity--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--the
order
of
the
lower
court,
your
honor,
indicates
that
he
is
to
be
re-sentenced.
there
is
a
benefit
and
i'm
sure--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--that's
correct.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
well,
that's
because
he
might...
if
he
is
re-sentenced,
he
could
face
not
just
a
lower
sentence,
but
a
deferred
sentence
which,
if
he
were
to
satisfy
the
conditions
of
the
deferred
sentence,
his
conviction
would
be
expunged,
thereby
avoiding
any
collateral
consequences
that
attend
conviction.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
well,
the
court,
lower
court,...
there
is
now
a
lower
court
order
which
mandates
that
there
be
resentencing
in
this
case.
certainly,
the
state
intends
to
try
to
obtain
his
whereabouts
and
return
him
to
the
jurisdiction.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
well,
it's--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--well,
it's
in
his
interests
to
return.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
well,
that's
true,
but
i'm
sure
the
court
would
agree
that
if
the
conviction
was
expunged
for
these...
if
there
was
no
record
of
these
convictions,
he
would
be
put
in
a
much
better
position.
he
would
have--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--well,
that's
an
option.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
he
certainly
runs
that
risk,
but
our
understanding
of
the
mootness
doctrine
is...
would
have
this
court
rule
on
the
merits
of
the
case
because
there
still
is
a
controversy.
there
is
an
opportunity
or
a
benefit
that
could
be
obtained
by
the
respondent.
he
may
not
obtain
that
benefit,
but
it
exists
nonetheless.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
well,
we
would
like
the
opportunity
to
have
the
case
resolved,
and
we
would
like
the
sentence
not
vacated--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--well,
the
attorney
general's
office
was
not
the
prosecuting
entity.
a
different--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--what
i'm--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
yes.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
well,
if
this
court
were
to--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--well,
we
might
be
able
to
obtain
his
whereabouts.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
no,
he's
not
on
parole,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
yes.
he
has...
incidentally,--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--well,
if
he
were
to
return
to
the
jurisdiction,
he
certainly
would--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--well,
he
runs--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--i
would
like
to
continue
with
the
facts,
if
i
may.
at
the
change
of
plea
hearing,
the
pre-sentence
investigator
report
was
ordered,
and
as
i've
stated,
counsel
and
the
respondent
did
have
notice
and
opportunity
to
consult
concerning
whether
or
not
the
respondent
should
submit
to
the
interview
and
they
also
had
a
chance
to
confer
concerning
its
scope
and
application
to
the
sentencing
process.
at
a
later
unspecified
time,
the
probation
officer
arrived
at
the
correctional
center
where
the
respondent
was
incarcerated
and
attempted
to
start
the
interview.
at
that
time,
the
respondent
sought
to
postpone
the
interview
asking
that
the
probation
officer
wait
until
the
arrival
of
the
defense
investigator.
at
that
juncture,
the
probation
officer
indicated
that
she
could
not
wait
but
that
the
respondent
had
the
choice
of
continuing
in
the
absence
of
the
defense
investigator
or
foregoing
the
interview
at
that
time.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
no,
there
is
not
a
specific
explanation
given
for
that.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
we
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
that's
what
was
stated,
but
we,
of
course,
don't
know
whether
he
would
have
arrived
in
ten
minutes
or
in
two
hours.
turning
to
the
compulsion
argument,
it's
clear
that
the
court
must
find
compulsion
in
order
for
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
have
been
violated.
there
is
no
compulsion
in
this
case.
the
respondent
was
given
the
option
of
going
ahead
with
the
interview
or
foregoing
the
interview.
the
probation
officer
made
no
threats
concerning
whether
or
not
if
he
exercised
the
choice
some
dire
consequence
would
attend.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
no.
it
certainly
put
the
defendant
to
a
choice,
but
it's
not
coercion.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
well,
it's
a
choice.
there
are
certainly
weighty
decisions
that
all
persons
make
when
they're
involved
in
the
criminal
process,
and
i'm
sure
it
would
give
me
some
reason
to
pause,
and
i
would
try
to
consider
my
options,
but
i
don't
think--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--we
don't
think
that
his
situation
as
an
incarcerated
individual
created
any
additional
pressure
or
coercion.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
well,
the
individual
had
been
at
the
correctional
center
for
a
few
months.
he
had
had
the
opportunity
to
confer
with
counsel,
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
submit
to
the
interview
process
in
the
first
place,
and
the
probation
officer
said,
if
you'd
like
to
go
ahead
now,--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--well,
it--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--it
doesn't,
but
we
submit
that--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--no,
the
record
doesn't
speak
to
that,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
yes,
it
does.
the
criminal
rules
permit
the
court
to
dispense
with
the
pre-sentence
investigative
report
if
the
defendant
or
respondent
does
not
wish
to
participate.
so,
that
was
certainly
his
option.
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
the
defendant
to
have
assumed
that
there
would
be
a
penalty
here.
he
lost
nothing
because
there
are
alternative
means
by
which
he
can
put
forth
a
picture
of
who
he
is,
so
the
court
can
consider
his
mitigating
characteristics
at
sentencing.
as
this
record
demonstrates,
defense
counsel
submitted
written
affidavits
from
the
victims,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
rules
that
precludes
even
the
submission
of
a
written
statement
from
the
defendant
himself.
so,
there
clearly
exists
documentary
roots
by
which
material
can
be
presented
for
the
court's
consideration
at
sentencing.
additionally,
the
rule
provides
for
an
opportunity
for
allocution,
both
from
defense
counsel
as
well
as
the
respondent,
and
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
respondent
can
rebut
the
accuracy
of
any
material
that
is
conveyed
in
the
presentence
investigation
report.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
i
am
not
certain,
your
honor.
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
briefed,
i
think
he
was
still
serving
his
sentence,
but
i'm
not
certain.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
yes,
with
credit
for
time
served.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
he
was
sentenced
in
january
of
1984,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
i
think
it's
similar
to
this
court,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
since
the
respondent
had
the
opportunity
to
forego
participation
at
the
pre-sentence
interview
and
had
these
alternative
means
by
which
he
could
supply
the
court
with
a
picture
of
who
he
was,
it
was
unreasonable
for
the
respondent
to
assume,
even
if
he
did
assume,
and
there
is
the
absence
of
an
assumption
on
his
part,
on
the
record,
that
he
would
incur
a
substantial
penalty
if
he
chose
to
forego
the
interview,
we
believe
the
state
court's
decision
in
regard
to
the
compulsion
aspect
of
this
case
is
clearly
erroneous
as
a
result.
moreover,
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
situation
of
compulsion,
the
respondent
must
assert
his
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
in
a
timely
fashion,
absent
certain
exceptions.
respondent
may
assert
that
one
of
those
exceptions
attends
here;
that
is,
the
one
relating
to
custody.
petitioner
respectfully
suggests
that
in
this
instance,
given
the
purpose
of
the
pre-sentence
investigator
report
and
the
comments
that
were
made
to
respondent
at
the
correctional
center,
that
this
is
not
a
situation
involving
custody,
so
as
to
excuse
the
assertion
of
the
privilege.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
originally,
your
honor,
he
was
charged
with
a
felony
count
that
carried
a
twenty-five
year
maximum.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
well,
he
entered
pleas
of
nolo
contendere
to
reduce
charges
of
simple
assault,
which
carried
a
one-year
maximum.
so,
instead
of
receiving
one
year
for
each
count,
he
received
nine
months.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
he
could
have
gotten
thirty-six
months,
if
my
mathematics
are
correct.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
the
reason
this
is
not
a
situation
involving
custody
is
that
despite
his
residence
at
the
correctional
center,
he
was
told
by
the
probation
officer
that
he
did
not
have
to
participate
at
the
interview.
certainly,
this
is
a
situation
where
his
will
was
not
overborne.
he
was
given
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
an
interview
which
would
give
him
a
chance
to
put
forth
his
point
of
view
or
he
could
forego
the
interview
and
rely
on
other
means
later
for
presenting
his
mitigating
characteristics.
certainly,
this
should
not
be
a
situation
given
the
philosophy
underlying
miranda
to
warrant
the
exception
to
the
assertion
of
the
privilege.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
no,
your
honor.
he
had
asked
that
the
interview
be
postponed
until
the
arrival
of
the
defense
investigator.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
it
would
appear
that
they
did,
your
honor,
but
we
submit
that
that
was
an
erroneous
determination.
certainly,
this
court
has--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--well,--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--the
respondent
has
filed
or
asked
this
court
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
the
examination
by
raising
the
sixth
amendment
claim.
so,
that
question
may
be
before
you,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
yes.
in
his
brief,
he
has
asserted
his
sixth
amendment
claim.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
his
cause
here--
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
--no.
the
now-missing
defendant
did
not
file
a
brief
with
this
court.
moving
to
the
incrimination
aspect
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
consider
our
argument
under
the
heading
of
enhancement.
we
submit
that
even
if
the
court
found
both
compulsion
and
excuse
the
failure
to
assert
the
privilege
that
the
respondent
suffered
no
incrimination.
by
incrimination,
the
state
means
an
enhanced
penalty.
the
privilege
is
violated
when
a
witness
is
compelled
or
a
respondent
to
testify
against
himself
and
the
result
is
exposure
to
a
penalty
or
to
some
criminal
responsibility.
here,
by
pleading
nolo
contendere,
respondent
faced
particular
terms
of
imprisonment
and/or
fines,
and
when
he
entered
his
pleas,
he
would
be
sentenced
in
the
court's
discretion
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
his
exposure
remained
the
same
whether
or
not
he
participated
at
the
pre-sentence
investigation
interview.
in
the
absence
of
some
enhanced
penalty,
we
submit
that
unlike
the
situation
in
estelle
v.
smith,
it
was
wrong
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
the
respondent's
sentence
had
been
enhanced
where
the
government
had
no
burden
of
proof
and
where
there
is
no
additional
element
that
had
to
be
required
prior
to
the
imposition
of
sentence.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
point,
i
wish
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
thank
you.
ms.
susan
r.
harritt
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
want
to
leave
the
court
with
this
impression,
which
is
that
it
certainly
wasn't
a
coercive
situation.
we
have
an
individual
who
had
had
the
opportunity
to
consult
with
counsel.
it's
clear
that
he
made
a
decision.
he
thought
that
he
could
score
some
points
and
possibly
persuade
the
probation
officer
that
he
had
a
particular
personality
or
mitigating
circumstances
that
he
thought
should
be
conveyed
in
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report.
this
court
should
not
prohibit
him
from
exercising
his
own
judgment.
rightly
or
wrongly,
we
don't
think
he
scored
any
points,
but
he
thought
that
he
did
and
he
should
not
be
precluded
from
having
that
opportunity
to
make
that
judgment
and
present
what
he
thought
was
in
his
best
interests.
thank
you.
