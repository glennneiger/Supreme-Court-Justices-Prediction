mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start,
first,
by
addressing
a
point
justice
blackmun
raising.
it's
true,
your
honor,
that
a
person
in
prison
is
in
a
different
situation
than
a
person
who
is
at
liberty
and
then
taken
into
police
custody.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
there
is
no
question
the
restraints
a
person
suffers
in
prison
or
in
jail
are
quite
real
and
quite
tangible,
but
the
fact
that
he
is
literally
in
custody
in
that
sense,
we
do
not
believe
requires
that
the
court
automatically
hold
he's
also
in
custody
for
miranda
purposes.
when
a
person
in
the
words
that
miranda
used
is
"swept
from
a
friendly
environment"
into
a
hostile
environment,
dominated
by
police,
he
is
in
a
position
which
there
is
a
risk,
miranda
believes,
a
great
risk,
miranda
believes,
that
he
will
be
subject
to
trickery
or
intimidation
or
other
types
of
ploys
that
would
work
on
his
free
will.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it's
not
necessarily
the
same.
there
are
circumstances,
of
course,
and
we
freely
recognize
it,
in
which
a
person
in
prison
would
also
be
in...
yes,
we
would
not
say
that
the
decision
in
the
mathis
case
automatically
mandates
miranda
rulings,
excuse
me,
miranda
requirements
for
every
prisoner
before
he
is
questioned
in
custody.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
difference,
we
believe,
is
this:
the
restraints
that
a
person
has
on
him
in
custody
imposed
the
background
environment
in
which
he
must
live,
but
those
restraints
are
not
of
the
type
that
would
necessarily
in
every
case
lead
a
person
to
believe
that
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
confess
when
he
is
confronted
with
someone
who
is
asking
him
questions.
that
is
the
situation
that
miranda
faced
and
that
is
the
situation
to
which
miranda
addressed
its
warnings.
a
person
who
is
questioned
about
an
unsolved
crime
in
the
basement
of
a
police
station
house
not
only
has
a
restriction
on
his
freedom
of
movement,
but
he
also
has
a
dislocation
that
accompanies
the
change
in
the
environment
from
which
he
was
into
the
one
he
is
in
now,
and
there
is
also
the
insinuation
by
the
inquisitor
that
the
questioning
will
not
cease
until
a
confession
is
obtained.
those
factors
are
not
necessarily
present
in
every
type
of
prison
questioning.
for
example,
here,
the
only
course
or
factor
that
the
vermont
supreme
court
pointed
to
was
the
fact
that
respondent
may
forfeit
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
the
interview
with
the
probation
officer.
that
factor
tends
to
indicate
that
the
vermont
supreme
court
and
respondent
saw
the
interview
not
as
a
burden
but
as
an
opportunity.
not
as
a
burden
in
which
he
had
to
fend
off
police
efforts
to
try
to
get
him
to
incriminate
himself,
but
an
opportunity
to
persuade
the
probation
officer
to
write
a
favorable
report.
in
addition,
as
the
court
recognized
in
minnesota
v.
murphy,
one
of
the
risks
associated
with
questioning
a
person
in
custody
is
that
the
questioning
may
lead
the
person
to
believe
that
he
has
no
free
will
to
decide
not
to
answer
a
question,
that
it
will
go
interminably.
that
wasn't
the
situation
here.
from
the
record
and
from
the
opinion
below,
the
probation
officer
gave
the
respondent
the
opportunity
to
decide
whether
to
go
forward
with
the
interview
at
the
appointed
time
in
the
absence
of
legal
representation
or
to
forego
the
interview
at
all.
now,
that
may
be
a
difficult
choice
for
someone
in
respondent's
position
to
make.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
we
don't
know
the
reason
why.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
would
believe
that
since
miranda
establishes
an
exception
from
the
general
rule
that
all
relevant
evidence
is
admissible,
the
burden
of
showing
that
miranda
is
applicable
should
be
on
the
person
invoking
that
exception.
in
other
words,
the
defendant
would
normally,
we
believe,
have
the
burden
of
establishing
that
he
war
in
custody
and,
in
this
case,
the
only
factor
that
vermont
pointed
to
to
show
that
he
was
in
custody
was
he
might
forfeit
this
opportunity.
that
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
be
comparable
to
the
type
of
questioning
that
miranda
was
addressing.
respondent,...
an
amicus
in
support
of
respondent,
rather,
have
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
questioning
was
performed
by
someone
who
is
outside
the
normal
prison
environment.
it
wasn't
a
guard.
it
wasn't
a
therapist.
it
was
a
probation
officer.
but
that
fact
also
does
not
necessarily
amount
to
the
type
of
compulsion
that
miranda
was
designed
to
deal
with.
it
is
true,
he
had
a
difficult
choice
to
make,
but
the
fact
that
he
had
a
difficult
choice
to
make--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
it's
not
a
rule
that
would
arise
in
the
federal
system
because--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--the
probation
office
does
object
to
it.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
we
have
taken
the
position
and
the
state
disagrees.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
don't
think
forcing
him
to
that
choice,
even
if
that
was
that
type
of
rule,
would
violate
his
sixth
amendment
right,
if
there
was
a
violation,
what
it
would
amount
to
is
a
violation
of
perhaps
his
right
whether
to
go
forward
with
allocution
or
something
along
those
lines.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
he
would
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
his
lawyer
present
if
he
wanted,
but
it's
not
unlawful
to
force
him
to
make
this
type
of
choice.
if
he
wants
to
have
the
attorney
present
and--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--we
believe
that
this
would
be
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceedings
the
state
disagrees
with
that.
if
he
wants
to
have
an
attorney
present
in
the
federal
system,
the
probation
office
doesn't
object.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
it
is
not
unlawful,
we
think,
to
put
him
to
a
choice
like
this.
this
isn't
the
type
of
attempt
to
circumvent
his
right
to
counsel
that
the
court
has
had
in
the
other
types
of
right-to-counsel
cases,
like
messiah
or
like
henry
or
like
moulton.
there
was
an
attempt
to
avoid--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--because
they
were
open
and
up
front
and
put
all
their
cards
on
the
table.
they
didn't...
for
whatever
reason,
the
probation
officer
said,
according
to
what
we
know,
that
we
will
have
the
interview
now
or
if
you
want
your
lawyer
present,
we'll
have
to
forego
it.
that
doesn't
mean
he
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
judge.
he
had
a
right
of
allocution.
it
doesn't
mean
he
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
probation
officer
because
we
know
from
the--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--at
that
time.
even
if
there
were
an
absolute
rule--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--even
if
they
had
adopted
that
rule,
we
would
say
that
it
would
not
violate
his
sixth
amendment
right.
of
course,
there's
some
reason
to
doubt
that
that
was
actually
the
rule
because
actually
what
happened
here,
because
at
page
14
of
the--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--on
those
facts,
we
would
say
it
would
not
violate
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
if
it
violated
anything,
it
would
be
a
right
to
present
evidence
at
sentencing.
so,
it
may
be
a
different
circumstance
in
the
type
of
situation
we
had
here
where
he's
being
interviewed
outside
of
the
actual
allocution
stage
and
when
he
would
be
in
court,
if
the
judge
said
you
can
talk
now
or
wait
till
your
lawyer
shows
up.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
we
would
say
that
he
would
have
a
right,
if
he
demanded
to
have
his
lawyer
there,
not
to
be
questioned
in
the
absence
of
the
lawyer,
but
they
didn't
question
him--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that's
right.
i
mean,
he
could
have
foregone
the
interview
entirely,
and
if
he
wanted
the
lawyer
present,
he
could
demand
it,
but
it
does
not,
we
think,
violate
the
sixth
amendment
to
offer
him
the
opportunity
to
go
forward
in
the
absence
of
his
lawyer,
which
is
essentially
what
happened
here.
now,
the
sixth
amendment
issue
is
not
one
that
was
addressed--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
we
didn't
say
that.
he
wasn't
required.
he
wasn't
required
to
go
forward
with
the
interview.
he
was
given
the
option.
he
was
given
the
option
of
using
that
time
to
help
persuade
the
probation
officer
that
he
deserved
probation
or
some
other
lighter
sentence
or
to
abandon
that
opportunity
at
that
time
and
talk
to
the
probation
officer.
i
mean,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record,
for
example,
at
page
14
where
it
indicates
that
the
probation
officer
called
the
defendant
later
to
verify
an
allegation
that
was
made
by
someone
else
that
would
go
into
the
pre-sentence
report,
the
allegation
being
that
the
respondent
was
a
member
of
a
gang.
so,
it
doesn't
necessarily
seem
that
this
was
a
now
or
never
situation
even
with
the
probation
officer.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
the
trial
is--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--it
is
quite
a
different
stage
entirely.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
there
is
nothing
that
requires
a
presentence
report
be
conducted.
there's
nothing
that
requires
that
an
interview
with
the
respondent
be
part
of
the
presentence
investigation.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
is
primarily
a
fifth
amendment
case,
and
that's
the
only
issue
that
was
addressed
below.
