justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
why
she
couldn't
wait?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
wouldn't
have
taken
very
long,
would
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
investigator
was
on
the
way,
wasn't
he?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
say
that
is
not
coercion
of
any
kind?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
would
you
feel
if
you
were
incarcerated
and
this
was
thrown
at
you?
would
you
feel
that
you
were
a
little
pushed
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
certainly
is
a
little
different
than
the
ordinary
day-to-day
decisions.
he
was
incarcerated.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
like
you
and
i
living
outside?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
he
had
asked
for
counsel?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
admit
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
if
he's
already
there
to
begin
with,
the
situation
is
different?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
kind
of
an
unnecessary
choice,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
who
has
the
burden
of
demonstrating
the
reason?
maybe
she
had
an
appointment
to
fix
her
hair
or
something.
