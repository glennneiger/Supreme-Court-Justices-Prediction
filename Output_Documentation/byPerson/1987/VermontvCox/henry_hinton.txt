mr.
henry
hinton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
of
the
vermont
supreme
court
in
this
case
is
correct
on
at
least
two
separate
grounds.
first,
the
court's
finding
of
a
fifth
amendment
violation,
that
is,
improper
compulsion
to
give
up
the
right
to
remain
silent,
correctly
decides
that
mr.
cox
was
required
by
the
probation
officer
unnecessarily
to
give
up
a
right
recognized
by
the
vermont
supreme
court
that
he
had
to
make
the
important
decision
about
participating
in
the
pre-sentence
investigation
interview
whether
to
participate,
whether
to
not
participate,
or
to
what
extent
to
participate,
only
after
consultation
with
counsel.
because
mr.
cox
was
told
by
the
probation
officer
that
he
could
not
make
a
counsel
but
only
an
uncounselled
decision
about
participation
in
the
interview,
a
choice
which
wasn't
even
a
correct
statement,
much
less
a
legitimate
statement
of
his
options
under
state
law,
his
disclosure--
mr.
henry
hinton
--i
think
they
felt
that
depriving,
mr.
chief
justice,
depriving
him
of
a
state
law
benefit,
if
it
be
only
a
state
law
benefit
to
have
the
right
to
counsel
before
being
required
to
participate
in
the
pre-sentence
investigation
interview,
was
a
valuable
state
benefit,
and
as
this
court
has
held
in
its
fifth
amendment
penalty
cases,
when
you
seek
to
retain
a
valuable,
albeit
state-created
benefit,
and
the
government
says
you're
going
to
lose
that
benefit,
if
you
claim
the
fifth
amendment,
then
the
court
has
found
that
that
is
compulsion.
it
makes
a
choice
in
the
face
of
that
choice
to
speak
involuntary.
mr.
henry
hinton
well,
i
think
that
is
at
least
a
permissible
reading.
i
do
argue
that
there
is
a
sixth
amendment
violation
directly
here
as
an
alternative
affirming
ground.
mr.
henry
hinton
the
sixth
amendment?
no,
no,
your
honor,
the
court
didn't
decide
the
case
on
any
basis,
any
federal
basis,
other
than
the
fifth
amendment.
the
fact
that
the
state
of
vermont
uses
the
presentence
investigation
process
at
all,
i
think
we
can
concede,
is
a
decision
that
they
would
have
to
undertake
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
or
possibly
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
they
wouldn't
have
to
say
that
in
order
to
be
given
a
valid
opportunity,
you
have
to
be
able
to
give
the
counsel
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
process.
but
even
if
these
rights
are
only
guaranteed
by
state
law,
that
doesn't
lessen
the
impropriety
of
conditioning
the
right,
the
federal
right
to
remain
silent
on
giving
up
these
state
benefits.
in
the
court's
other
cases,
holding
that
states
may
not
condition
exercise
of
fifth
amendment
rights
on
forfeiture
of
a
benefit,
the
benefit
is
typically
state-created,
the
right
to
employment
as
a
police
man
or
sanitation
worker,
the
right
to
bid
on
and
to
get
government
contracts,
or
the
right
to
hold
political
office.
the
solicitor
general
and
the
state
of
vermont
seem
to
argue
that
this
right
isn't
very
important,
that
it's
minimized
as
a
right
that
isn't
important
or
isn't
that
important,
so
that
to
lose
that
right
amounts
to
compulsion
to
speak.
well,
the
aba
standards
in
the
vermont
court's
own
decision,
i
think,
as
well
as
its
rules
and
its
practice
indicate
that
most
people
think
that
for
a
defendant
who
has
been
convicted,
there
is
nothing
more
important
than
a
presentence
investigation
report
and
possibly
there
is
nothing
more
important
about
that
report
than
what
the
defendant
does
in
response
to
his
opportunity
to
offer
a
statement
or
decline
a
statement
to
that
report.
mr.
henry
hinton
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
hinton
there
was
coercion
for
him
to
seize
the
opportunity
to
make
a
statement,
i
maintain,
and
the
only
opportunity
offered
him
because
he
was
told
by
the
probation
officer
that
he
would
never
have
another
chance,
he
made,
we
contend,
an
ill-advised
decision
without
counsel
to
offer
material
that
counsel
well
and
probably
should
have
advised
him
not
to
give.
mr.
henry
hinton
i
think
that
being
told
that
you
would
never
have
another
chance,
incorrectly
told
that
he
would
never
have
another
chance
because
the
vermont
court
said,
in
fact,
that
wasn't
an
appropriate
choice
to
put
him
to,
was
coercive
in
that--
mr.
henry
hinton
--and,
also,
when
there,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
henry
hinton
--the
coercion
was
the
loss
of
the
opportunity
to
make
a
decision
whether
to
offer
any
sort
of
material
with
counsel.
he
would
have,
in
any
scenario,
had
to
make
a
decision
at
some
point
whether
to
participate
or
not.
we're
not
arguing
as
the
state
and
solicitor
general
suggests
against
the
necessity
of
having
to
make
a
choice.
what
we're
arguing
against
is
the
necessity
to
have
to
make
an
uncounselled
choice
and
that
inappropriate
pressure
put
on
him
by
the
requirement
of
that
choice,
we
contend,
contributed
to
his
decision
to
speak
ill-advisedly.
mr.
henry
hinton
my
understanding
is
that
there's
no
rule
in
vermont
that
says
that
you
can
or
cannot.
my
knowledge
of
the
situation
is
that
sometimes
counsel
does
attend,
sometimes
counsel
confers
with
the
individual
and
decides
to
let
the
defendant
go
on
his
own.
mr.
henry
hinton
i
am
not
aware
if
that
is
commonly
done
or
usually
done.
mr.
henry
hinton
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
might
be
correct.
i
think
that
it
might
be
decided
and
maybe
in
many
cases
would
be
decided
that
the
best
way
to
prepare
for
this
is
to
confer
maybe
beforehand
and
then,
in
part,
to
suggest
to
the
probation
officer
that
the
defendant
isn't
trying
to
somehow
shield
himself
with
counsel
to
have
a
defendant
go
on
his
own.
in
this
case,
the
vermont
supreme
court
found
that
although
i
don't
see
a
problem
in
the
usual
case
in
having
counsel
present
during
the
interview
and
the
vermont
supreme
court
didn't
seem
to
think
it
was
a
problem,
in
this
case,
what
defense
counsel
asked
for
or
said
we
were
seeking
to
do
and
it
was
short-circuited,
was
the
right
to
confer.
mr.
cox
said
he
didn't
want
to
talk
to
the
probation
officer
until
the
investigator
for
the
defense
counsel's
office
arrived.
it
wasn't
clear
that
he
necessarily
wanted
that
person
to
participate
and
be
with
him
throughout
or
only
to
give
him
some
information
beforehand
about
what--
mr.
henry
hinton
--for
the
purposes
of
fifth
amendment
argument,
i
think
that
they
certainly
feel
like
and
have
decided
that
the
investigator
at
least
should
have
a
right
to
investigate.
they
don't
view
that
as
being
anything
less
important
in
this
case
than
counsel.
for
the
purposes
of
looking
at
it
as
a
federal
question,
whether
a
request
for
an
investigator
is
a
request
for
counsel,
i've
argued
that
primarily
in
contrast
to
a
few
other
cases,
the
fare
case
and
a
7th
circuit
case,
franzen,
that
just
as
in
those
cases,
asking
for
probation
officer
shouldn't
be
something
that
automatically
equates
to
seeking
to
remain
silent
or
seeking
an
attorney;
asking
for
defense
investigator
should
be
treated
that
way.
mr.
henry
hinton
no,
your
honor,
you've
never
held
that.
i
essentially
would
maintain
that
unlike
fare
and
franzen,
where
the
probation
officer
clearly
is
not,
as
this
court
has
held
in
minnesota
v.
murphy,
is
not
only
a
friend,
but
also
maybe
a
person
with
adverse
interests
to
the
defendant,
a
defense
investigator
under
vermont
law
has...
is,
under
the
rules
of
vermont
evidence,
considered
a
representative
of
the
attorney
and
comes
within
evidence
rule
502
as
a
person
who
has
privileged
communications.
also,
as
vermont
public
defense
system
uses
defense
investigators,
they're
paralegals.
they're
trained
in
advising.
mr.
henry
hinton
i
think
that's
correct,
that
the
rules
of
evidence
don't
apply
at
sentencing.
mr.
henry
hinton
the
probation...
well,--
mr.
henry
hinton
--the
probation
officer...
we're
not
asserting
the
right,
justice
marshall,
to
have
the
probation
officer
accompanied
by
a
defense
investigator
or
a
lawyer
in
all
of
his
or
her
investigative
efforts.
mr.
henry
hinton
the
reason
is
that's
a
confrontation
between
the
accused
and
an
agent
of
the
state
in
which,
as
happened
in
this
case,
the
accused
can,
through
inadvertence
or
lack
of
knowledge,
incriminate
himself.
mr.
henry
hinton
that's
right.
client
stands
to
possibly
benefit
or
possibly
disadvantage
him
or
herself
in
that
context.
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
cox
obviously
disadvantaged
himself
in
that
context.
mr.
henry
hinton
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
hinton
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
maintain
that
you
have
to
presume
as
in
the
miranda
context
in
this
case
compulsion.
i
maintain
that
there
was,
in
fact,
compulsion
here
based
on
the
probation
officer's
choice
put
to
mr.
cox
that
he
would
lose
the
chance
to
make
an
informed
decision,
which
the
vermont
court
said
he
had
the
right
to,
without
participation
or
declining
to
participate.
mr.
henry
hinton
that
is
the
kind
of
choice
people
have
to
make
at
trial.
i
think
the
mcgautha
v.
california
decision
indicates
that
there's
a
lot
of
hard
choices.
all
we're
asking
for
in
this
case
or
all
we're
complaining
about
isn't
the
necessity
to
make
a
choice,
but
the
necessity
to
make
a
choice
without
advice.
mr.
henry
hinton
that's
correct,
but
the
way
the
counsel
issue,
justice
o'connor,
fits
into
the
fifth
amendment
argument
is
that
even
if
you
assume
that
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
conferred
by
the
federal
constitution,
which
we
maintain
there
certainly
should
be
a
critical
stage
like
a
psi
interview,
but
even
if
you
assume
there's
not,
there's
a
vermont
law
right
to
confer
with
counsel
which
the
probation
officer
in
this
case
did
not
respect,
and
because
the
probation
officer
offered
an
alternative
or
a
set
of
alternatives
to
mr.
cox
that
the
law
of
vermont
doesn't
even
find
to
be
permissible,
he
made
an
unfree,
if
you
will,
or
a
coerced
choice
when
he
went
ahead
and
spoke.
mr.
henry
hinton
well,
i
asked
them
to,
your
honor.
in
a
way,
i
wish
they
would
have.
mr.
henry
hinton
in
the
supreme
court
of
vermont,
but
not
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
henry
hinton
the
defender
general's
office?
mr.
henry
hinton
the
public
defender
in
burlington,
the
public
defender
office,
represented
mr.
cox
at
trial
and
then
at
the--
mr.
henry
hinton
--that's
correct.
they
were
counsel
for
him
at
that
time.
mr.
henry
hinton
from
the
record,
we
only
know
that
since
counsel
claimed
that
she
didn't
get
an
adequate
opportunity
to
advise
mr.
cox
and
unlike
what
counsel
for
the
state
of
vermont
represented,
we
can't
assume
from
this
record
that
there
was
some
period
of
time
after
the
guilty
pleas
or
the
nolo
pleas
or
some
reasonable
period
of
time
before
she
showed
up
for
the
interview.
we
don't
know
that.
we
don't
know
but
what
that--
mr.
henry
hinton
--i
am
only
amicus
in
this
court,
your
honor.
no.
i'm
amicus
for
my
own
client,
essentially
here,
because
i'm
not
able
to
find
the
man
and
was
unable
to
have
him
sign
an
informal
pauper's
affidavit
and--
mr.
henry
hinton
--he's
gone
from
vermont.
i
don't
know
where
he
is.
i
had
the
same
investigator
try
to
find
him.
mr.
henry
hinton
i
think
not.
i
think
the
possibilities
suggested
by
the
state
that
he
could
get
a
deferred
sentence
is
so
unlikely
that
he
would
be,
i
think,
foolish
to
come
back.
mr.
henry
hinton
i
think
that's
probably
what
both
i
would
tell
him
and
probably
the
prosecuting
authorities
would
be
happy
with.
mr.
henry
hinton
i
can't
recall
exactly,
justice
scalia,
the
chronology.
at
the
time
i
argued
the
case,
i
think
some
time
in
1985,
he
was
still
in
custody.
it
was
quite
a
period
of
time,
and
i
would
have
to
look
back
to
reconstruct
it.
it
was
quite
a
number
of
months
between
the
time
it
was
argued
and
the
time
it
was
decided.
in
that
interim,
i
really
didn't
keep
in
touch
with
mr.
cox.
i
tried
to
get
back
in
touch
with
him
when
the
decision
came
down,
and
i
couldn't
find
him.
mr.
henry
hinton
well,
he's
going
to
get
sentenced--
mr.
henry
hinton
--i
think
he'd
be
foolish
to
come
back.
i
agree
with
you,
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
the
possibility
of
him
having
the
benefit
of
a
deferred
sentence
is
not
realistic,
number
one.
that's
a
procedure
where
you're
essentially
on
probation
and
then
if
it's
completed
successfully,
you
have
your
conviction
expunged.
it
can
only
be
offered
with
the
consent
of
the
prosecutor
and
it's
rarely
offered
to
someone
like
mr.
cox
who
independent
of
these
cases
that
we're
here
on
had
a
substantial
criminal
record.
it's
usually
offered
to
first
offenders.
so,
i
don't
think
he's
under
any
inducement
really
to
come
back.
mr.
henry
hinton
i
think
if
he
presses--
mr.
henry
hinton
--yes,
it
would
be
in
his
interests,
but
i
think
the
likelihood
of
getting
a
deferred
sentence,
because
he's
got
a
prior
record
of
criminal
offenses
that
existed
in
other
states
way
before
these
three
simple
assaults.
mr.
henry
hinton
very
little.
mr.
henry
hinton
i
can't
imagine,
unless
it
was
something
that
if
he
like
negotiated
from
afar
so
that
he
didn't
subject
himself
to
anything
unless
and
until
it
was
all
worked
out
and
he
came
to
the
vermont--
mr.
henry
hinton
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
reason
why
i
think
independent
of
the
fifth
amendment
argument,
which
i
think
i've
presented
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
no
necessary
federal
right
to
counsel
at
this
stage,
is
that
there's
a
state
right
to
counsel
and
that
was
burdened
by
the
choices
offered.
but
i
also
think
independent
of
that,
this
court
should
decide
that
where
there's
a
guilty
pleading
or
nolo
pleading
defendant
or
in
any
case
where
there's
a
conviction
and
there's
no
sentence
that
for
the
pre-sentence
investigation
process
should
be
subject
to
the
sixth
amendment
only
in
this
respect,
and
that
is
in
the
respect
that
when
the
defendant
is
interviewed,
that
defendant,
just
like
in
post-indictment
lineup,
he's
confronted
with
agents
of
the
state
who
can
do
things,
just
like
in
a
post-indictment
interrogation,
he's
confronted
with
agents
of
the
state
in
which
he
needs
to
make
those
fine
distinctions
about
what
may
or
may
not
incriminate
him,
in
the
same
way
that
what
happens
at
a
line-up
or
what
happens
at
a
post-indictment
and
pre-trial
interrogation
can
seal
the
fate
of
the
defendant
making
the
trial
a
formality,
the
sentencing
hearing
in
the
same
way
can
become
a
walk-through,
if
the
defendant
has
essentially
operated
without
counsel
during
his
interview
with
the
probation
officer.
i
think
the
court
could
very
well
find
and
given
the
analogy,
i
think,
to
the
other
processes
by
which
the
court
has
determined
that
critical
confrontations
outside
of
court
between
a
defendant
and
the
government
are...
those
kinds
of
things
which
sixth
amendment
protects,
was
designed
to
protect,
i
think
the
court
can
support
the
decision
of
the
vermont
supreme
court
strictly
on
the
basis
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
henry
hinton
if
the
defendant
has
got
a
very
terrible
record
and
is
very
unlikely
to
do
anything
more
than
make
it
worse,
i
think
non-participation
would
be
what
would
be
called
for.
mr.
henry
hinton
some...
i
think
that's
true.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
percentages
are.
i
think
some
maybe
will
refuse
to
participate
even
if
they're
advised
to
participate,
but--
mr.
henry
hinton
--as
a
practical
matter,
i
don't
think
there
is--
mr.
henry
hinton
--as
a
technical,
theoretical
matter,
it
might
be.
mr.
henry
hinton
well,
they
have
the
order
outstanding.
mr.
henry
hinton
i
don't
think
they
have...
they
don't
have
to
do
anything
other
than
worry
about
it
if
he
comes
back.
mr.
henry
hinton
i
think
that
only
in
the
most
technical
way
is
it
not
moot.
mr.
henry
hinton
they
don't
have
to
grant
him
a
re-sentencing
unless
he
seeks
it
and--
mr.
henry
hinton
--on
the
grounds
of
mootness?
mr.
henry
hinton
i
only
care
if
he
comes
back.
mr.
henry
hinton
well,
perhaps--
mr.
henry
hinton
--right.
mr.
henry
hinton
i
don't
know
if
they
would
force
a
re-sentencing
on
him
if
he
didn't
ask
for
it.
i
really
doubt
that
that
would
be
the
case.
mr.
henry
hinton
well,
it
wouldn't
bother
me
if
you
all
were
to
find
this
was
a
moot
case,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
hinton
thank
you.
