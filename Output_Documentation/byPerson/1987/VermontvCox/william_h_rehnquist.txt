ms.
harritt,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
harritt.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
larkin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
hinton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
a
correct
statement
of
his
options
under
state
law...
why
didn't
the
supreme
court
of
vermont
go
on
that
ground
rather
than
raising
a
federal
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
hadn't
read
the
supreme
court
of
vermont
opinion
quite
that
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hinton,
as
a
matter
of
practice
in
these
vermont
pre-sentence
investigations,
i
take
it
would
you
say
ordinarily
a
defendant
does
attend
with
counsel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
what
you
know,
is
it
customary
for
a
lawyer
to
sit
there
and
then
the
probation
officer
to
ask
questions
and
the
lawyer
to
advise
the
defendant
not
to
answer
on
the
grounds
it
might
incriminate
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
strikes
me
that
whatever
the
abstract
constitutional
right
of
the
situation
may
be,
this
is
not
a
very
good
way
for
a
defendant
to
get
a
favorable
pre-sentence
report.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
is
the
equivalent
of
counsel
in
the
views
of
the
vermont
supreme
court,
an
investigator
from
the
defense
counsel's
office?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
never
held
that,
have
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
again,
as
matter
of
practice,
is
it
common
in
a
situation
like
this
for
a
defendant
not
to
participate
in
the
interview
with
the
probation
officer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
the
advice
that
the
public
defender
of
chittenden
county
would
give
to
somebody
like
that,
i
take
it?
so,
it's
a
fairly
recognized
practice
in
vermont
criminal
jurisprudence
that
a
certain
number
of
defendants
are
not
going
to
participate
in
these
interviews.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hinton.
ms.
harritt,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
harritt.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
no.
86-1108,
vermont
against
cox,
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
