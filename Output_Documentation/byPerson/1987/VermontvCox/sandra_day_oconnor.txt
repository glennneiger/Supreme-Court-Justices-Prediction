justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
harritt,
does
the
record
indicate
whether
either
the
court
or
the
probation
officer
told
the
respondent
the
purpose
of
the
interview?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
the
record
indicate
whether
the
public
defender
had
notice
of
the
time
that
interview
would
be
given?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
whether
the
defendant
was
ever
told
about
the
purpose
of
the
interview
or
whether
he
could
participate
in
it
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
record
tell
us
anything
about
the
purpose
of
the
state
in
refusing
to
wait
or
why
it
put
the
defendant
to
the
immediate
choice
it
did?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
state
of
vermont
law
make
it
optional
with
a
defendant
to
participate
in
a
psi
interview?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
thought
the
vermont
court
found
that
that
was
a
request
for
counsel.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
don't
have
that
question
before
us
here,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
we
just
had
to
assume
that
was
correct.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
court
below
didn't
address
that
at
all,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
seems
to
me
that's
just
your
sixth
amendment
claim,
not
the
fifth
amendment
claim.
that
the
fifth
amendment
claim,
i
find
hard
to
see
what
the
coercion
is,
but
i
understand
what
you're
arguing
about
is
the...
being
forced
to
make
the
decision
without
advice
of
counsel
about
whether
to
speak
or
not,
whether
to
participate
or
not,
and
that
would
be
a
sixth
amendment
claim,
right?
