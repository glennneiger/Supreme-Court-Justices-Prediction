ms.
harritt,
do
we
know
where
respondent
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
could
be
dead,
couldn't
he?
what
kind
of
a
case
do
we
have
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
dead
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
have
him
committed
to
an
insane
asylum.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
maximum
sentence
he
could
have
gotten?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
do
you
deliver
the
maximum?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
many...
well,
how
many
were
the
maximum
number
of
months
he
could
have
gotten?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
were
arguing
about
two
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
require
somebody
to
do
something
in
the
judicial
process
without
a
lawyer
does
not
touch
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
need
a
lawyer?
it's
not
sworn
testimony.
you
use
hearsay.
you
use
toilet
paper
written
on.
you
use
anything.
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
apply
to
the
probation
report.
the
probation
officer
goes
around
and
talks
to
the
bartender.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
talks
to
anybody.
he
doesn't
need
a
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
do
you
need
it
with
your
client?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
can
also
get
himself
a
low
sentence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
comes
back
and
commits
another
crime,
he's
going
to
get
another
sentence,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
there's
any
possibility
of
him
coming
back.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
thing
we
have
is
the
man
is
gone.
and
has
served
his
sentence.
i
don't
know
what
we're
all
talking
about.
