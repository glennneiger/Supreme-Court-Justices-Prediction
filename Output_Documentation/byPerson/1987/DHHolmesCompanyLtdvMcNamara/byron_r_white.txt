justice

suppose
a
customer
of
holmes
ordered
from
holmes
an
item
of
equipment.
holmes
ordered
it
from
out
of
state
and
had
it
shipped
directly
to
its
customer,
and
this
customer
is
liable
for
use
tax.
justice
white
that
is
because
they
are
going
to
use
it
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
justice
white
but
also
holmes,
holmes
could
be
made
to
collect
that
tax.
justice
white
now,
i
don't...
and
the
activity
is
the
receipt
and
use
of
something
in
louisiana.
justice
white
holmes
certainly
is
having
these
catalogues
imported
and
delivered
to
its
customers
for
use
by
them
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
justice
white
why
can't
you
tax
holmes
for
having
these
things
imported
for
use
in
louisiana?
justice
white
yes,
but
holmes
is
certainly
having
that
use
provided.
justice
white
hopefully.
justice
white
those
are
pretty
old
people.

you
mean
in
the
holmes
store.
justice
white
suppose
holmes
had
ordered
3,000
travel
alarm
clocks
to
give
to
their
best
customers,
and
they
told...
they
ordered
them
from
out
of
state
and
gave
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
customers
they
wanted
the
clocks
mailed
to.
now,
do
you
suppose...
couldn't
the
state
charge
holmes
a
use
tax
on
those
clocks?
justice
white
they
certainly
made
them
available
to
their
customers.
justice
white
say
they
ordered
3,000
alarm
clocks.
they
send
1,500
of
them
to
us,
send
the
other
1,500
to
the
following
people.
they
intend
to
give
the
1,500
delivered
to
them
to
other
people.
they
can
be
taxed
on
the
1,500
but
not
the
other.
