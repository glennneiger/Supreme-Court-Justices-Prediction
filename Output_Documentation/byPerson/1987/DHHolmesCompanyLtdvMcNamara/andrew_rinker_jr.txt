mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case
for
the
first
time
since
its
decision
in
the
complete
auto
transit
versus
brady
the
court
is
faced
with
a
question
of
whether
a
state
may
constitutionally
impose
a
direct
use
tax
on
the
value
of
goods
while
those
goods
are
still
in
the
stream
of
interstate
commerce.
appellant
holmes
is
a
louisiana
corporation
operating
department
stores
in
louisiana
and
three
other
states.
during
1979
to
1981,
holmes
as
a
part
of
its
marketing
strategy
contracting
with
various
designers
of
catalogues
in
new
york
for
the
design,
creation,
printing
and
distribution
of
its
catalogues.
in
turn,
these
catalogue
designers
contracted
with
printers
in
atlanta,
boston,
and
oklahoma
city
for
the
addressing,
printing,
and
mailing
from
their
local
post
offices
direct
to
certain
select
residents
of
the
states
in
which
holmes
does
its
retail
business.
at
no
time
did
holmes
or
any
of
its
agents
or
employees
have
any
contact
with,
receive
or
take
possession
of
the
catalogues
which
had
been
mailed
directly
from
the
out
of
state
post
offices
to
selected
residents
within
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
they
are
in
the
state
of
louisiana
and
three
other
states
located
in
the
gulf
coast
areas.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
florida,
mississippi,
and
alabama.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
to
the
82
percent
of
the
catalogues
which
actually
went
into
the
state
of
louisiana.
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
well,
sir,
that
question
is
still
at
issue.
although
the
court
below
determined
that
holmes
did
own
the
catalogues
at
the
point
at
which
title
to
the
catalogues
was
transferred
to
the
particular
residents,
you
will
note
that
in
the
particular
contract
as
described
and
was
found
by
the
lower
courts,
we
actually
contracted
for
a
service,
that
is,
the
construction
of
catalogues
and
the
subsequent
sending
of
those
catalogues
directly
to
residents.
at
no
time
did
holmes
actually
take
title
because
we
contracted
for
the
performance
of
a
service
rather
than
for
the
purchase
of
particular
goods.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
if
the
catalogues
weren't
delivered
to
the
selected
residents
in
louisiana,
the
post
office
was
instructed
by
the
instructions
on
the
catalogue
to
leave
those
catalogues
with
the
then
current
resident,
and
if
they
weren't
distributed
to
the
then
current
resident
they
were
distributed
or
sent
back
to
the
home
store.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
holmes
ultimately
would
get
the
catalogues
back
that
weren't
actually
distributed.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
those,
the
ones
that
holmes
got
back,
yes,
your
honor,
are
subject
to
tax
because
in
that
particular
situation
holmes
then
obtained
possession
and
control
over
those
catalogues
incident
to
ownership.
the
basis
of
a
use
tax--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
we
have
to
focus
on
the
purpose
and
the
incidence
of
a
use
tax.
a
use
tax
is
one
which
is
designed
to
tax
some
activity
of
the
taxpayer
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
in
this
particular
case
holmes
performed
no
activity
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction
to
subject
it
to
tax.
holmes
did
not
purchase
the
catalogues
within
the
taxing
state.
clearly
the
purchase
would
have
taken
place
in
one
of
the
other
states,
either
in
new
york
or
where
the
printers
are
located.
the
use
of
the
catalogues
by
holmes
in
connection
with
any
use
by
holmes,
none
of
that
use
took
place
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
holmes...
the
only
activity--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--basically
that's
correct.
it's
the
importing
of
the
catalogues
or
placing
an
order
which
caused
the
catalogues
to
ultimately
be
distributed--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--in
the
court
below
the
only
incident
of
taxation
was
causing
these
catalogues
to
be
imported.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
other
activity
performed
by
holmes
in
connection
with
these
catalogues.
for
example,
there
was
no
evidence
that
holmes
placed--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
this
court
has
focused
on
jurisdiction
to
impose
a
tax
in
two
separate
areas.
although
they
are
separate,
they
are
somewhat
related.
one
is
the
due
process
ground
and
the
other
has
to
do
with
the
commerce
clause
ground.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
that's
correct.
holmes
does
not
dispute
that
holmes...
that
louisiana
and
holmes
have
a
due
process
contact,
but
the
issue
here
is
that
there
is
no
contact
between
the
activity
or
the
various
activities
involved
with
importing
the
catalogues
and
the
state
of
louisiana.
simply
by
placing
an
order
does
not
constitute
activity
certainly
in
light
of
this
court's
past
decisions
on
what
constitutes
activity
subject
to
tax
which
is
sufficient
to
impose
the
tax.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
i
don't
agree
with
your
premises,
justice
o'connor,
and
that
is
that
the
activity
does
not
create
the
right
of
a
state
to
tax.
holmes,
because
it
operates
department
stores,
it
makes
sales,
it
owns
property,
creates
in
louisiana
the
right
to
actually
tax
holmes,
but
the
particular
activity
which
we
are
talking
about
here,
and
that
is
the
distribution
of
catalogues,
does
not
establish
a
link
with
the
state
of
louisiana
which
allows
louisiana
to
tax
it
on
commerce
clause
grounds.
on
due
process
grounds,
certainly,
no
one
can
argue
that
holmes
has
great
and
significant
contacts
with
the
state
of
louisiana.
but
for
commerce
clause
purposes
at
least
as
far
as
the
way
this
court
has
interpreted
so
far,
is
that
the
tax
has
to
be
imposed
on
the
activity
of
the
taxpayer
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
you
are
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
the
customer
would
be
liable
for
the
use
tax.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--you're
right,
your
honor.
holmes
would
be
required
to
collect
a
use
tax,
and
this
court
made
the
point
very
clearly
in
its
national
geographic
case,
where
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
state
of
california
could
require
national
geographic
to
collect
a
use
tax
on
sales
of
goods
made
to
particular
residents
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
that's
correct,
the
customers
are
in
fact
using
the
catalogues.
if
this
were
a
tax
on
holmes--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--well,
justice
white,
as
you
just
pointed
out,
the
person
who
is
actually
using
the
catalogues
within
the
state
of
louisiana
is
the
recipient,
not
holmes.
holmes
cannot--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--holmes
receives
the
benefit
of
people's
using
its
catalogues
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
that
is
certainly
correct.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
hopefully
will
receive
them.
otherwise
presumably
holmes
would
not
have
ordered
the
catalogues
in
the
first
place.
similarly,
this
court
might
focus
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
in
the
case
of
the
designer
blue
jeans
or
in
the
case
of
gucci
handbags,
are
those
retailers
liable
for
use
tax
in
louisiana
when
someone
carries
them
around
within
the
state
of
louisiana?
technically
they
are
using
and
advertising
those
products
by
having
those
particular
articles
of
clothing
or
apparel
with
them
at
the
time.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
yes,
they
could
have,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
people
go
and
shop
at
holmes
and
have
been
shopping
at
holmes
for
over
150
years,
long
before
catalogues
ever
became--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--somebody
would
still
be
shopping
over
there
also.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
they
have
been
shopping
at
the
holmes
stores,
and
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
catalogues
to
be
distributed
in
order
for
them
to
purchase
items
from
holmes.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
holmes
at
one
time
was
contemplating--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--no,
there
wasn't
a
loss
involved,
your
honor,
but
there
are
several
reasons
for
distributing
catalogues
other
than
the
cases
that
you
faced...
other
than
the
situations
in
the
cases
that
you
faced
where
there
is--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
it
is
for
business
purposes.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
just
as
holmes--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--that's
right.
that's
why
holmes
caused
them
to
be
imported.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it.
but
the
public
relations
effect
of
the
catalogues--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
they
did
cause
it
to
be
imported.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
if
they
had
to
come
up
and
deliver
it
themselves,
there
is
no
question
that
at
that
point
holmes
would
have
had
possession
and
control
of
the
catalogues
within
the
state
of
louisiana.
that
possession
and
control
would
be
sufficient
to
impose
the
tax.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
i
apologize,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
that's
basically
correct.
our
opponents,
however,
suggest
that
we
did
this
solely
in
order
to
avoid
taxes.
that
is
certainly
not
the
case.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
holmes
ordered
its
catalogues
in
this
manner
because
it
participated
in
what
is
called
the
atkins
buying
organization.
in
its
participation
with
this
organization
in
new
york
it
obtained
the
design,
construction,
printing,
and
distribution
of
catalogues
at
discount
rates.
it
had
no
control
over
where
the
catalogues
were
going
to
be
designed.
it
had
no
idea
where
the
catalogues
were
going
to
be
printed.
it
simply
relied
on
its
participation
in
this
purchasing
organization
in
new
york
to
handle
all
of
this.
if
in
fact
the
purchase
organization
had
found
that
the
best
arrangement
could
have
been
made
with
louisiana
printers,
it
perhaps
would
have
contracted
with
louisiana
printers
for
this
purpose.
in
fact,
the
organization
didn't
find
that.
holmes
did
not
adopt
this
method
of
distributing
catalogues
in
order
to
avoid
louisiana
taxes.
we
are
focusing
here
on
the
obligation
of
a
state
to
collect
a
use
tax
versus
the
obligation
for
it
to
have
a
use
tax
imposed
upon
its
use
of
goods
in
the
state.
as
i
mentioned
in
the
national
geographic
case,
this
court
specifically
pointed
out
the
distinction
between
imposing
the
obligation
on
holmes
to
collect
a
use
tax,
which
we
would
not
dispute
in
this
case.
if
in
fact
this
were
a
situation
where
the
taxing
state
was
trying
to
get
holmes
to
collect
taxes
on
the
value
of
the
catalogues
in
the
hands
of
a
recipient,
there
would
be
no
problem,
and
the
state
could
do
that.
the
state
could
impose
the
obligation
on
us.
because
we
have...
because
holmes
has
due
process
contacts
with
louisiana,
the
state
could
require
us
to
collect
the
tax
from
the
recipients.
however,
this
court
made
it
very
clear
in
its
decision
in
national
geographic
by
stating
that
however
fatal
to
a
direct
tax,
and
that
is
the
tax
we
are
talking
about
here,
direct
tax,
direct
use
tax
on
holmes
on
the
value
of
these
catalogues,
might
be,
that
particular
legal
argument
does
not
apply
in
the
case
of
imposing
the
obligation
on
the
taxpayer
to
collect
a
use
tax
on
someone
else
in
the
taxing
state
who
actually
used
the
goods
which
are
sought
to
be
taxed.
that
is
the
basic
difference
in
our
case.
in
this
case
the
operating
incident
of
any
activities
by
holmes
took
place
outside
of
the
taxing
state.
all
of
the
manufacture
and
construction
of
the
catalogues,
the
addressing,
the
mailing
took
place
out
of
louisiana.
none
of
the
activity
sought
to
be
taxed
to
constitute
use
or
distribution
with
louisiana
took
place
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
you
are
correct,
there
are
a
lot
of
louisiana
ties
sufficient
for
establishing
of
the
due
process,
for
example.
but
i
will
give
you
an
example.
if
in
this
particular
case
the
catalogues
were
printed
in
the
state
of
georgia
and
were
trucked
through
each
of
the
states
to
get
to
louisiana,
including
mississippi
and
alabama,
presumably
each
of
those
states,
if
they
had
decided
they
could
tax
goods
in
interstate
commerce,
as
we
are
doing
here,
those
states
could
impose
a
use
tax
on
the
goods
as
they
are
traveling
through
the
state.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
but
the
due
process
contacts
between
holmes
and
the
state
of
louisiana
exist
in
those
states.
for
example,
if
we
dropped
off
merchandise
there
or
catalogues,
those
states
also
would
have
a
right
to
impose
a
use
tax
collection
obligation,
but
presumably...
and
also
in
those
states
since
the
catalogues
are
under
our
possession
and
control
in
the
hands
of
the
printer,
those
states
could
assess
a
use
tax
on
the
value
of
the
catalogue,
because
the
state
in
those
states,
at
least
in
the
state
of
georgia
where
one
of
the
printers
is
located,
the
catalogues
are
actually
present
there
and
we
can
have
some
control
over
them.
once
goods
are
placed
in
the
stream
of
interstate
commerce,
no
one,
not
even
the
owner,
is
deemed
to
have
any
possession
or
control
incident
to
ownership,
and
at
all
times
these
catalogues
are
located
in
commerce.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
for
purposes
of
use
taxation.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
in
your
earlier
cases
prior
to
the
complete
auto
transit
case,
you
pointed
out
that
goods
in
interstate
commerce
are
not
subject
to
any
type
of
direct
tax.
presumably
complete
auto
did
not
overrule
those
earlier
decisions.
interstate
commerce
involving
goods
starts
at
the
time
that
they
are
actually
shipped
and
ends
at
the
time
of
acceptance
of
the
catalogues.
in
this
case
acceptance
would
have
taken
place
upon
the
removal
from
the
post
office
box
by
the
recipient
of
the
catalogue
of
the
catalogue.
at
the
time
the
recipient
takes
the
catalogue,
it
is
not
holmes's
catalogue
and
no
use
tax
can
be
imposed
on
holmes.
therefore
during
the
entire
route
from
the
time
the
catalogue
is
actually
dropped
into
the
mail
until
the
recipient
takes
it,
holmes
does
not
have
any
right
to
the
catalogue
or
does
not
exercise
any
rights
incident
to
ownership.
those
rights
mean
possession
or
control
over
the
catalogues--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--incident
to
ownership
sufficient
for
taxation.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
well,
in...
complete
auto
transit
dealt
with,
again,
activities
rather
than
taxation
of
goods.
complete
auto
transit--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--the
activities
taxed
in
complete
auto
and
its
progeny
are
solely
related
to
indirect
benefits
to
interstate
commerce.
in
those
cases
the
tax
was
imposed,
for
example,
in
the
complete
auto
case,
imposed
upon
the
gross
receipts
of
a
trucking
company
which
shipped
the
goods.
the
court
didn't
even
consider
the
possibility
that
the
state
might
tax
the
goods
while
they
were
in
the
truck
being
shipped.
it
only
focused
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
trucking
activities
were
subject
to
taxation.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
in
the
first
place,
the
activities
can
be
more
clearly
identified
with
a
particular
taxing
jurisdiction.
for
example,
in
commonwealth
edison
versus
montana
it
was
clear
that
the
coal
was
being
mined
in
the
state
of
montana.
there
was
an
activity
within
the
state
of
montana
for
which
a
tax
was
imposed.
in
complete
auto,
the
activity
was
the
shipping
on
particular
trucks
within
the
state
of
illinois...
within
the
state
of
mississippi
that
was
taxed.
in
our
case,
if
someone
is
allowed
to
impose
a
direct
use
tax
on
goods
which
are
the
commerce
itself,
every
state
through
which
the
commerce
passes
would
theoretically
have
the
right
to
tax
those
goods
provided
that
those
states
through
which
the
goods
were
being
transferred
had
due
process
contacts
with
the
taxpayer.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
there--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--in
the
case
of
the
goods,
the
goods
are
isolated...
in
the
case
of
goods
or
the
catalogues
in
this
particular
case,
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
activity,
as
the
court
pointed
out,
and
the
nexus
test
in
the
complete
auto
case
is
that
there
must
be
some
nexus
between...
and
justice
brennan,
who
wrote
the
opinion,
pointed
very
clearly
that
the
connexity
has
to
be
between
the
activity
and
the
taxing
state.
in
this
case
there
is
no
connection
between
the
activity
and
the
taxing
state.
there
is
a
connexity
between
holmes
and
the
taxing
state,
but
not
between
the
activity--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--involved
in
affording
the
catalogues.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
but
there
is
no
operational
incidence
of
any
activity
within
the
state
of
louisiana
which
can
be
taxed.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
having
the
catalogues
distributed
in
louisiana
does
not
involve
any
operational
incidence,
does
not
involve
any
act
by
holmes
within
the
taxing
state.
we
place
an
order--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--even
assuming
the
state's
theory--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--correct,
it
did
cause
the
distribution
in
louisiana
simply
by
placing
an
order
for
the
catalogues,
but
that
activity
took
place
outside
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
therefore
louisiana
has
no
jurisdiction
to
tax,
to
impose
a
direct
tax
on
an
activity
which
took
place
outside
of
its
borders.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
the
actual
transfer
of
title,
perhaps,
under
the
state's
theory.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
but
holmes
did
not
engage...
because
the
catalogues
at
all
times,
even
when
they
are
in
the
state,
when
they
are
in
the
mailbox,
when
they
are
in
the
postal
service--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--atlanta,
boston,
and
oklahoma
city.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
that's--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--that
is
not
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
record
certainly
does
not
support
that.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
the
actual
instruction...
in
the
first
place,
the
record
does
not
support
that
the
holmes
person
who
said,
we
want
to
order
the
catalogues,
actually
placed
the
order
from
within
the
state
of
louisiana.
that
is
not
in
the
record.
in
the
second
place,
the
person
who
ordered
the
catalogues
ordered
them
from
a
buying
organization
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
state
of
new
york
then
directed
the
particular
printers...
holmes
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
selection
of
the
particular
printers.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
holmes
provided
them
to
the
buying
organization,
which
ultimately
got
to
the
printer.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
but
all
of
those
activities
took
place
outside
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
assuming
that
there
was
an
actual
transfer
of
title
to
the
catalogues,
which
i
mentioned
earlier
is
still
in
dispute,
transfer
of
title
to
holmes
prior
to
delivery
to
the
particular
residents,
any
of
those
states,
assuming
a
sale
had
been
completed
there,
could
have
imposed
a
sales
tax,
but
all
of
those
states
happen
to
have
exemptions
for
printed
materials.
all
those
states
also
happen
to
have
exemptions
from
their
sales
tax
for
merchandise
that
is
sent
outside
of
the
state
or
is
intended
for
distribution
outside
of
the
state,
so
presumably
those
states
could
have
a
right
to
tax
the
catalogues,
but
they
chose
not
to.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
as
to
which
one
has
the
closest
contact?
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
the
one
that
has
the
closest
due
process
contact
with
the
state
of
louisiana
is
holmes,
but
i
think
the
problem
is,
we
are
trying
to
mix
two
different
concepts,
the
due
process
concept
versus
the
interstate
commerce
clause
concept.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
it--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--in
brief,
our
argument
is
that
since
there
are
no
activities
by
holmes
within
the
state
of
louisiana,
activities
being
those
types
of
activities
similar
to
the
ones
that
this
court
has
addressed
in
its
previous
decisions
after
complete
auto,
that
in
fact
there
are
no
activities,
and
because
of
that
the
tax
must
be
imposed
on
the
goods.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
assuming
there
is
an
activity
which
has
sufficient
connexity
and
sufficient
operating
incidences
under
the
state
statute
which
requires
distribution,
then
it
would
be
subject
to
tax.
that's
correct.
but
we
are
saying
that
there
are
no
activities
in
the
state
of
louisiana
which
subject
the
catalogues
to
being
taxed.
the
incidental
activities
that
have
been
referred
to
by
the
various
justices,
such
as
placing
an
order,
are
not
operational
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
actual
transportation
by
holmes
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
there
is
no
mining
by
holmes.
there
is
no
collection
of
a
use
tax
obligation
on
the
citizens
who
actually
receive
and
do
use
the
catalogues.
and
because
of
that
we
say
that
there
is
no
activity
in
the
state
of
louisiana
upon
which
the
state
can
assess
its
tax.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
under
existing
jurisprudence,
yes,
your
honor.
all
those
could
be
taxed.
the
reason
being
is
that
holmes
took
possession
and
control
of
the
catalogues--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--in
that
particular
case
i
would
think
louisiana
might
try
and
tax
100
percent.
we
of
course
then
would
argue
that
these
goods
were
still
in
the
course...
as
long
as
they
are
not
stored
for
our
benefit--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--and
they
are
just
temporarily
stopped
over,
that
they
are
intended
to
be
continuously
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
that
incidental
stopover,
we
will
say,
to
be
shifted
from
a
common
carrier
to
the
postal
service
is
not
sufficient
to
impose
the
tax
on
holmes
of
the
value
of
catalogues
sent
outside
of
the
state.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
no,
justice
scalia.
that
is
not
the
case
here,
because
there
is...
if
the
catalogues
are
shipped
to
louisiana
and
they
do
sit
in
a
warehouse,
for
example,
before
being
transshipped,
we
are
engaged
in
the
activity
of
storage.
we
are
not
engaged
in
any
activity
like
that
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
but
the
state
tax
statute
deals
with
use,
which
can
be
defined
as
any
type
of
use,
including
storage.
storage
is
one
element
of
use.
in
the
case
where
the
catalogues
are
stored
before
they
are
distributed,
a
use
tax
can
be
imposed
on
holmes.
in
the
case
where
there
is
actual
distribution
activity,
such
as
in
the
complete
auto
case,
where
there
were...
the
distribution
activities
involved
transportation
of
a
trucking
company
of
particular
goods,
that
activity
of
distribution
is
subject
to
tax.
holmes
does
not
engage
in
such
activities
when
it
is
in
the
state.
it
simply
places
an
order
in
a
foreign
state
and
requires
those
catalogues
to
be
sent
to
particular
residents.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
i
beg--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--and
orders
the
transportation,
but
does
not
perform
the
activities.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
if
they
did
it
with
their
own
trucks?
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
the
trucking
activity
could
be
taxed,
but
not
necessarily
the
goods
in
interstate
commerce
unless
the
state
tried
to
tax
them
because
they
were
storing
them--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--on
the
trucks.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
we
didn't
do
it
for
that
reason,
your
honor,
but
that
is
what
actually
happened
in
fact.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
focusing
again
on
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
fact
that
holmes
caused
the
importation
of
these
catalogues,
can
holmes
be
subject
to
the
tax
for
causing
this
importation?
the
louisiana
use
tax
imposes
a
tax
on
the
use
which
defines
certain
terms,
including
the
term
distribution
and
storage.
causing
importation
is
not--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--justice
white,
no,
they
could
not,
because
holmes
does
not
exercise
any
power
or
control
over
those
clocks
once
they
come
into
the
taxing
state.
a
use
tax
is
on
the
value
of
the
use
of
tangible
personal
property.
holmes
does
not
actually
use
those
clocks
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
it's
true,
but
once
those
clocks
go
into
the
hands
of
the
customer,
they
are
not
in
holmes's
hands,
and
a
use
tax
on
holmes
cannot
be
imposed.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
yes,
because
there
is
a
use
within
the
taxing
state.
we
exercise
control,
possession
and
control
over
those
clocks.
we
can
do
with
them
whatever
we
want
within
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
those
would
be
subject
to
the
use
tax.
the
ones
that
are
mailed,
however,
are
not
subject
to
tax
because
we
do
not
exercise
any
power
over
those
clocks
within
the
state
of
louisiana
incident
to
any
ownership.
power
and
control
over
the
clocks
in
the
state
of
louisiana
is
essential
to
impose
the
tax.
the
state
statute
uses
the
words
distribution.
distribution
is
not
simply
causing
something
to
be
imported.
distribution
involves
the
actual
delivery.
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
in
determining
the
operational
incidence
of
the
statute,
you
are
correct,
the
state
court
does
determine
that.
this
court,
however,
has
the
prerogative
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
incidence
upon
which
the
state
court
imposes
the
tax
does
violate
the
commerce
clause,
and
we
are
saying
that
this...
the
importing
aspect
of
distribution
is
not
one
of
the
activities
which
the
state
has
the
power
to
tax
under
the
commerce
clause
because
in
that
instance
there
is
no
activity
within
the
state
of
louisiana
by
holmes
which
can
be
taxed.
remember,
the
key
word
is
activity
by
holmes
with
respect
to
those
clocks
within
the
state
of
louisiana.
i
would
like
to
point
out
also
in
my
closing
moments
that
the
severe
burdens
that
might
be
caused
by
following
the
state's
position
in
this
case
certainly,
if
a
taxpayer
can
be
taxed
simply
by
having
something
mailed
into
the
state,
provided
that
taxpayer
has
some
minimum
contacts
with
the
state,
then
all
the
materials
mailed
to
particular
residents
will
be
subject
to
tax
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer.
for
example,
red
cross
mailings.
the
red
cross
organization
has
offices
in
virtually
every
state.
if
they
send
out
from
washington,
d.c.,
or
from
the
national
or
international
headquarters
notices
soliciting
funds
for
particular
purposes,
the
red
cross
is
using
property
within
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
to
the
extent
it
is
using
property
under
the
state's
theory,
the
value
of
those
pieces
of
paper
in
a
state
are
then
subject
to
tax.
this
tax
would
also
impact
universities
trying
to
solicit
particular
funds
for
their
operations.
you
say,
well,
there
is
no
contact
between
a
university,
but
i
think
that
you
will
find
recruiting--
mr.
andrew
rinker,
jr.
--oh,
sorry.
thank
you,
your
honor.
