justice
stevens
mr.
rinker,
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
if
i
may.
supposing
instead
of
mailing
them
they
had
delivered
the
whole
100
percent
of
the
catalogues
to
a
louisiana
location,
then
distributed
82
percent
to
louisiana
residents
and
18
percent
to
mississippi
residents.
could
they
tax
100
percent
of
the
goods
in
that
event?
justice
stevens
there
is
an
activity
involving
all
100
percent.
but
do
you
think
the
state
would
now
claim
they
could...
say
82
percent
now
to
go
louisiana
by
mail
and
18
percent
to
mississippi.
would
the
state
claim
louisiana
can
tax
all
100
percent?
justice
stevens
you
may
the
same
argument
you
make--
justice
stevens
you
would
also
be
engaged
in
the
activity
of
shipping
82
percent
to
local
residents
and
18
percent
to
out
of
state
residents,
and
your
opponent
argues,
well,
this
is
the...
what
you
have
got
here
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
that
but
you
have
just
used
the
mails.
so
they
must
be
claiming
the
right
to
tax
the
18
percent
as
well
as
the
82
percent.
justice
stevens
--mr.
pugh?
justice
stevens
if
holmes
owned
the
catalogues
in
louisiana,
did
they
also
own
the
catalogues
that
were
sent
to
the
mississippi
customers?
justice
stevens
could
louisiana
impose
a
use
tax
on
the
18
percent
that
went
to
out
of
state
customers?
justice
stevens
could
mississippi
impose
a
use
tax
on
the
18
percent
that
went
to
mississippi?
justice
stevens
you
think
it
could.
justice
stevens
well,
it
is
a
fifth
of
the
total
amount.
i
guess
it
is
worth
fighting
about.
you
think
an
out
of
state...
in
other
words,
if
holmes'
stores
were
located
in
mississippi
and
all
of
the
management
went
in
mississippi,
and
the
catalogues
just
happened
to
be
sent
to
louisiana
customers,
you
would
still
have
as
strong
a
case?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
you
do
not
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
stores
are
located
in
louisiana?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
you
need
that?
do
you
think
you
need
the
stores...
because
that
is
why
i
asked
you
about
mississippi.
justice
stevens
but
if
we
are
focusing
on
the
activity--
justice
stevens
--and
their
ownership
of
the
catalogues
just
before
they
are
turned
over
to
their
customers--
justice
stevens
--it
would
be
the
same
case,
as
i
understand
it,
if
the
stores
were
located
in
mississippi.
justice
stevens
so
that
if
any
manufacturer
mails
something
to
a
customer
in
another
state,
even
free,
the
manufacturer
can
be
taxed
on
that
item
in
the
other
state,
or
causes
it
to
be
mailed
by
a
third
party.
justice
stevens
we
are
concerned
about
who
else
can
be
hit
with
this
kind
of
tax.
i
assume
that
under
the
theory
that
the
state
is
running
here,
anybody
who
goes
to
a
mass
mailing
firm
and
gets,
you
know,
has
them
get
a
list
of
customers,
every
time
you
send
a
brochure
to
a
customer
in
louisiana,
you
are
telling
me
that
the
louisiana
courts
hold
that
i
own
the
brochure,
and
i
am
using
it
when
i
get
it
mailed
to
a
customer,
and
therefore
i
can
be
taxed
on
that?
isn't
that...
that
is
the
logic
of
the
position
the
state
is
making,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
yes.
well,
that
is
a
good
source
of
tax
revenue.
what
case
of
ours
is
the
strongest
support
that
you
can
cite?
justice
stevens
more
than
that,
you
are
promoting
out
of
state
business.
i
mean,
what
is
the
difference?
if
you
own
the
brochure,
as
you
say,
you
automatically
own
it
if
you
have
ordered
it.
justice
stevens
and
if
you
are
distributing
it
in
louisiana
that
is
enough.
