mr.
robert
g.
pugh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
delighted
that
you
asked
the
trucking
question.
it
was
of
interest
to
me
to
read
in
one
of
the
dissenting
opinions
in
one
of
the
state
court
decisions,
paraphrasing,
holmes
should
not
be
required
to
have
their
employees
to
ride
around
on
the
mail
trucks.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
occurred
here
and
so
found
by
the
state
court
was
that
holmes
distributed
the
catalogues.
the
distribution
of
the
catalogues
is
a
use
in
louisiana.
louisiana
happens
to
be
one
of
three
states
that
adopts
that
word,
distribution,
as
it
relates
to
use.
i
wouldn't
suggest
for
a
moment
that
the
word
use
is
not
broad
enough
to
include
distribution,
whether
or
not
it
is
so
spelled
out
by
the
state.
in
this
instance
it
is.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it
is
the
use
of
the
property,
your
honor.
what
happened
is,
holmes--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--it
is
holmes'
property.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
no,
sir.
it
is
holmes'
catalogues.
they
bought
them.
they
paid
for
them.
they
told
them
precisely
who
to
send
them
to.
they
took
all
of
the
charge
customers
to
send
them
to
them.
that
is
where
the
list
came
from,
the
charge
customers.
they
admitted
during
the
trial
that
it
is
the
charge
customers
who
are
more
likely
to
use
the
catalogues.
in
addition
to
that,
the
catalogue
itself
spells
out
in
the
centerfold,
it
gives
you
an
800
number.
it
gives
you
all
of
the
phone
numbers
for
each
of
the
local
stores.
in
addition
to
that,
the
telephone
directory,
which
is
an
exhibit
here
to
the
extent
applicable
for
holmes,
has
got
a
mail
order
number.
how
can
you
mail
order
what
you
don't
know
is
not
mail
orderable?
in
this
instance,
you
find
out
by
reading
the
catalogue.
it
tells
you
if
you
want
to
ask
further
questions
to
call
up
on
it.
now,
holmes
owned
the
catalogue.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it
was
so
found
by
the
state
court
below.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
holmes
would
own
those
catalogues
just
the
same
as
if
they
had
been
sent
in
louisiana,
but
to
answer
the
court--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--no,
sir,
and
would
not
attempt
to.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it
could
if
it
chose
to
do
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it
may
be
that
18
percent
is
de
minimis.
i
am
not
sure.
there
were--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--well,
i
would
have
a
case
insofar
as
louisiana
is
concerned.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
in
fact,
i've
got
a
strong
case
because
the
other--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--i
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
stores
are
located
in
louisiana
to
assist
in
the
nexus
question,
and
in
addition
to
that
the
whole
purpose--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--no,
sir,
i
don't
think
i
need
the
stores.
but
i've
got
13
of
them
there,
and
i've
got
5,000
employees.
i've
got
half
a
million--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--the
activity
is
the
distribution.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
as
i
can
appreciate
what
the
court
is
saying,
i
do
not
disagree
with
what
the
court
is
saying.
i
do
say
in
this
instance,
and
of
course
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
mississippi
problem--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--well,
i
guess
we
had
better
decide
now
whether
we
are
talking
about
who
is
going
to
collect
the
tax.
in
this
instance
holmes
is
in
louisiana.
they
argue
that
they
don't
have
to
pay
the
tax
because
they
don't
have
somebody
up
in
new
york
that
is
collecting
the
use
tax
for
them,
and
of
course
that
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
in
that
holmes
is
in
louisiana,
holmes
is
directly
responsible
for
the
tax
and
should
be
obligated
to
pay
it,
and
we
would
insist
to
the
court
or
suggest
to
the
court
that
they
ought
to
be
liable
for
it.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
that
could
certainly
be
construed
under
the
position
that
we
are
taking.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
the
strongest
support
for
the
position
that
i
am
primarily
taking
in
this
case
is
the
one
that
was
handed
down,
xx
pipe,
last
year,
when
the
suggestion
was
made
xx
the...
excuse
me...
here
it
is,
taxpayers
are
better...
to
establish
and
maintain
a
market
in
this
state
for
the
sales.
that
is
exactly
what
they
are
doing.
they
are
maintaining
a
market
in
the
state
of
louisiana
for
their
sales
by
the
use
of
the
catalogues.
precisely
what
they
are
doing.
in
addition
to
that,
the
national
geographic
case
speaks
in
terms
of
being,
whether
or
not
it
is
disassociated
from
the
local
business.
that
is
the
last
thing
this
is,
is
disassociated
from
the
local
business.
it
is
actually
promoting
the
local
business
for
holmes.
and
that's
the
purpose
of
the
catalogues.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
you
own
it.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it
is.
and
that's
what
they're
doing.
now,
turning
back,
if
i
may
for
a
moment,
to
the
state
court
in
louisiana
ownership
does
not
require
that
there
be
possession
of
the
item
itself.
you
may
own
something
in
louisiana
without
possessing
it.
in
addition
to
that,
and
so
found
by
the
lower
court,
in
addition
to
that
these
were
gifts,
and
the
gifts
are
not
completed
until
they
are
accepted
by
the
resident
and
either
kept
or
thrown
away.
they
belong
to
holmes
from
the
time
and
during
the
processing,
during
the
mailing,
during
their
receipt
in
louisiana
they
continued
to
belong
to
holmes.
as
justice
o'connor
says
and
counsel
acknowledged,
holmes
is
a
dealer,
a
dealer
who
imports
or
causes
to
be
imported
tangible
personal
property
into
louisiana
for
distribution
is
liable
for
the
tax,
precisely
what
took
place
here.
distribution,
as
i
have
indicated
earlier,
is
a
use
that
is
taxable.
distinguishing
between
the
two,
there
was
some
question,
i
believe,
earlier
concerning
the
sale
or
use
tax.
the
basic
distinction
as
i
appreciate
between
the
two
is,
a
sales
tax
is
on
the
freedom
of
purchase,
and
a
use
tax
in
turn
is
on
the
enjoyment
of
that
purchase.
that
is
precisely
what
holmes
was
doing.
they
were
enjoying
the
catalogues
that
they
purchased
for
the
purpose
of
furthering
their
business.
did
you
have
a
question,
your
honor?
excuse
me.
i
saw
you
move
your
hand,
and
i
thought
you
were
about
to--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--you
gave
me
enough
trouble
earlier,
your
honor,
i'll
tell
you.
as
i
have
indicated,
these
catalogues
were
designed
by
holmes,
admittedly
by
their
own
employees
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
their
sales,
for
the
purpose
of
generating
business.
they
did
in
fact
generate
business.
they
caused
people
to
come
into
the
stores.
for
that
reason
we
believe
that
holmes
is
liable
for
the
tax,
and
i
do
not
believe
i
need
any
additional
time
unless
i
may
answer
any
questions
the
court
might
have.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
thank
you.
