justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
harrison,
i
guess,
though,
that
holmes
caused
the
distribution
in
louisiana
of
the
catalogues
for
its
benefit.
justice
o'connor
so
is
the
taxable
activity
the
causing
of
distribution
of
the
catalogues
for
its
benefit
in
the
state?
justice
o'connor
is
that
not
an
activity
that
can
be
taxed
in
the
jurisdiction?
justice
o'connor
is
that
an
insufficient
activity
for
a
jurisdiction
to
impose
a
tax?
justice
o'connor
why?
justice
o'connor
you
didn't
raise
a
due
process
issue
here.
justice
o'connor
i
just
don't
understand
the
argument.
if
the
activity
is
sufficient
for
due
process
purposes
to
permit
the
taxing
jurisdiction
to
tax,
then
how
does
the
commerce
clause
change
the
result?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
honchell--
justice
o'connor
--now,
wait
a
minute.
if
the
activity
is
causing
the
distribution
in
louisiana,
that
is
connected
with
louisiana.
justice
o'connor
well,
sure,
it
is
having
the
catalogues
distributed
there.
justice
o'connor
holmes
caused--
justice
o'connor
--holmes
caused
the
distribution.
he
ordered
it.
he
paid
for
it.
he
caused
the
distribution
in
louisiana.
or
it
did,
i
should
say.
justice
o'connor
i
thought
the
distribution
occurred
within
the
state.
justice
o'connor
okay.
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
