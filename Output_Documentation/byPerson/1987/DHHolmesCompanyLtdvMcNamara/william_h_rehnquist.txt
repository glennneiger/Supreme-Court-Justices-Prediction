chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
d.
h.
holmes
company,
limited,
against
shirley
mcnamara,
secretary
of
revenue
and
taxation
of
louisiana.
mr.
rinker,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--and
holmes
owned
those
catalogues,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
that
much
should
turn
on
an
incident
of
title?
i
mean,
holmes
put
this
whole
process
in
operation
where
the
catalogues
were
created.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if
one
looks
at
the
whole
plan,
so
to
speak,
certainly
you
can
pick
out
incidents
that
took
place
elsewhere,
as
you
point
out,
but
the
idea
was
holmes',
they
wanted
to
engender
a
distribution
of
catalogues
in
louisiana
that
would
help
sell
their
products
in
louisiana.
there
are
certainly
a
lot
of
louisiana
ties.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
they
wouldn't
have
nearly
the
claim
that
louisiana
would,
because
holmes
is
located
in
louisiana.
the
stuff
is
going
to
people
in
louisiana
to
stimulate
sales
in
louisiana.
georgia
and
mississippi
do
not
have
any
claims
like
that,
do
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
no
one
is
deemed
to
have
any
control
incident
to
ownership
when
goods
are
placed
in
the
stream
of
interstate
commerce.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
you
add
for
purposes
of
use
taxation
then
you
are
relying
on
some
cases
of
this
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
rinker,
supposing
that
you
were
looking
at
this
transaction
from
a
philosophical
point
of
view,
from
on
high,
and
you
looked
at
what
took
place
in
georgia,
and
what
took
place
in
louisiana,
and
what
took
place
in
mississippi
and
alabama
and
the
states...
which
state
do
you
think
would
have
the
greatest
claim,
just
in
a
perfectly
common
sense
way,
to
put
a
tax
on
this
transaction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rinker.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
pugh.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pugh.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rinker,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
construction
of
the
state
statute
is
not
for
us.
the
louisiana
court
has
held
the
state
statute
does
cover
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
rinker.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
no.
87-267,
d.
h.
holmes
company,
limited
versus
mcnamara,
involves
a
state
tax
on
commercial
activities.
d.
h.
holmes
is
a
department
store
based
in
new
orleans
and
it
had
its
merchandize
catalogs
printed
out
of
state
and
shipped
to
its
customers
in
louisiana.
louisiana
levied
a
used
tax
on
the
value
of
these
merchandize
catalogs.
d.
h.
holmes
who
was
required
to
pay
the
tax
argued
that
the
imposition
of
this
tax
on
its
catalogs
violated
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
we
disagree
and
find
instead
that
the
tax
was
fully
consistent
with
the
commerce
clause.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
louisiana
court
of
appeals
and
that
opinion
is
unanimous.
