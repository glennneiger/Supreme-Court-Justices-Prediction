could
holmes
have
made
a
dollar
in
louisiana
without
those
catalogues?
justice
marshall
how?
justice
marshall
you
mean
in
the
holmes
stores.
justice
marshall
well,
why
did
holmes
waste
all
that
money
if
it
wasn't
necessary?
justice
marshall
did
it
have
a
loss
or
something?
justice
marshall
to
get
business.
there
is
no
other
reason
that
i
can
conceive
except
for
business
purposes.
justice
marshall
and
to
get...
the
only
business
they
were
interested
in
was
selling.
justice
marshall
and
the
only
interest
in
louisiana
was
to
sell
something
to
a
louisiana
citizen.
justice
marshall
you
say
holmes
caused
it
to
be
imported.
justice
marshall
and
if
they
had
picked
them
up
and
delivered
them
themselves
they
would
have
been
in
trouble.
justice
marshall
i
can
now
see
the
memorandum
that
the
law
department
gave
holmes.
justice
marshall
i
can
now
give
you
the
law
memorandum
that
the
lawyers
gave
holmes.
if
you
do
it
this
way
you
won't
have
to
pay
taxes.
is
that
correct?
justice
marshall
well,
what
other
reason?
justice
marshall
an
order
for
transportation.
justice
marshall
an
order
for
transportation.
justice
marshall
but
if
they
had
done
it
with
their
own
trucks
it
would
be.
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
but
they
could
be
taxed.
justice
marshall
and
so
to
escape
the
tax
you
send
it
by
parcel
post.
