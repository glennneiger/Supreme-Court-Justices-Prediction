the
facts
here
only
apply
to
the--
justice
scalia
mr.
rinker--
justice
scalia
--why
do
you
say
that
presumably
complete
auto
transit
does
not
overrule
those
cases?
justice
scalia
you
can
tax
the
activity
of
conducting
interstate
commerce
but
you
can't
tax
the
goods
that
are
going
through
interstate
commerce?
justice
scalia
why
is
it
more
harmful
to
what
the
commerce
clause
seeks
to
protect
to
allow
the
goods
to
be
taxed
than
it
is
to
allow
the
activity
of
carrying
the
goods
to
be
taxed?
doesn't
either
one
equivalently
harm
interstate
commerce?
justice
scalia
why
isn't
that
the
same
thing
with
the
trucker
who
carries
the
goods?
presumably
every
state
through
which
that
trucker
drives
can
tax
the
activity
of
his
trucking.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
i
don't
see
a
whole
lot
of
difference
between
the
two.
justice
scalia
mr.
rinker,
does
it
make
any
difference
to
you...
from
your
response
to
the
questions
i
gather
it
doesn't...
that
the
tax
is
not
upon
the
activity
but
upon
the
property?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
so
long
as
the
activity
would
justify
a
tax
on
the
activity
we
can
assume
that
the
tax
is
a
tax
on
the
activity
as
opposed
to
a
tax
on
the
property,
which
is
what
it
is?
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
but
you
concede
that
if
there
is
an
activity
that
could
be
taxed
as
an
activity,
then
this
tax,
even
though
it
is
not
a
tax
on
an
activity
but
simply
a
property
tax,
must
be
upheld
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice
scalia
--you
are
going
to
lose
that
once
you
have
conceded
that
so
long
as
there
is
an
activity
that
the
state
could
place
a
tax
on,
and
if
we
find
there
is
such
an
activity
here,
it
really
wouldn't
matter
where
the
catalogues
were
shipped,
right?
we
just
look
at
the
whole
activity.
justice
scalia
now,
does
this
include...
suppose
i
am...
well,
could
you
tax
the
mailman
for
distributing
these
catalogues?
justice
scalia
you
see,
the
property
tax,
it
is
on
the
catalogues,
isn't
it?
it
is
either
on
the
purchase
or
the
use
of
the
property,
but
you
have
to
have
a
property
interest,
right?
justice
scalia
of
your
own
property.
if
it
is
somebody
else's,
if
i
borrow
a
neighbor's--
justice
scalia
--if
i
borrow
a
neighbor's
catalogue
and
read
it,
you
wouldn't
hit
me
with
a
use
tax,
would
you?
justice
scalia
mr.
pugh--
justice
scalia
don't
provoke
me,
mr.
pugh.
