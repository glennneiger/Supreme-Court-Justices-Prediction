mr.
david
klingsberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
an
appeal
on
writ
of
certiorari
limited
to
two
issues
as
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
with
one
dissent
denied
petitioner's
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
set
aside
the
death
sentence
imposed
upon
him.
petitioner
was
convicted
of
three
counts
of
first
degree
murder,
and
with
the
court's
permission
i
propose
to
begin
with
the
facts
and
the
legal
argument
relating
to
the
first
issue,
which
concerns
coercive
procedures
threatening
the
impartiality
of
the
jury
during
the
sentencing
phase
and
then
move
later
to
the
facts
and
legal
argument
on
the
second
point,
which
is
premised
on
the
absence
of
a
meaningful
finding
of
at
least
one
valid
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
at
the
sentencing
phase.
during
the
sentencing
phase
on
the
second
day
of
deliberations
after
about
nine
hours
a
note
came
from
the
jury
indicating
that
the
jurors
were
in
great
distress,
there
was
a
great
unbalance
in
the
voting,
and
that
the
jurors
were
unable
to
reach
a
decision
at
this
point.
the
court
then
undertook
a
procedure
whereby
each
juror
was
asked
to
put
his
name
on
a
piece
of
paper
indicating
yes
or
no
as
to
whether
further
deliberations
would
be
helpful
in
obtaining
a
verdict.
four
jurors
indicated
no.
the
jurors
then
indicated
that
some
had
misunderstood
the
question
and
the
procedure
was
repeated,
changing
the
language
to
whether
further
deliberations
will
enable
the
jurors
to
reach
a
verdict.
at
that
point
the
no
votes
were
whittled
down
to
one
juror.
finally,
the
court
delivered
a
modified
allen
charge,
telling
the
jurors
when
they
enter
the
jury
room
it
is
their
duty
to
discuss
the
evidence
with
the
objective
of
reaching
a
just
verdict.
some
time
between
30
minutes
and
55
minutes
after
that,
the
jurors
came
in
with
a
unanimous
verdict
recommending
the
death
sentence.
mr.
david
klingsberg
there
is
reference
to
a
discussion
in
chambers
which
is
not
on
the
record
in
which
it
appears
that
there
is
a
stipulation
as
to
the
polling
procedure.
however--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--the
judge
stated
on
the
record
that
there
was
a
discussion
in
chambers
where
there
was
a
stipulation--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
might
also
add
in
that
connection
that
earlier
that
morning,
right
after
the
jury
came
in
with
the
note,
and
right
after
the
vote,
there
were
motions
for
a
mistrial
in
which
defense
counsel
objected
to
the
entire
procedure
of
continuing
on
in
the
face
of
a
louisiana
code
provision
which
expressly
provided
that
in
the
event
of
a
lack
of
unanimity
on
the
part
of
the
jury
or
the
jury's
inability
to
agree
that
a
sentence
of
life
without
parole
or
probation
must
be
imposed.
counsel
also
asked
the
court
on
the
record
to
instruct
the
jury
that
there
is
no
obligation
under
the
law
to
reach
a
verdict,
and
that
application
was
denied,
and
an
objection
was
taken
thereto.
now,
in
assessing--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--it
appears
that
way
from
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
david
klingsberg
no,
your
honor,
there
was
not.
mr.
david
klingsberg
that
was
not...
that
has
not
been
raised,
and
indeed,
as
indicated
in
our
reply
brief
at
note
6,
it
does
not
under
the
law
of
louisiana
and
this
court
result
in
any
lack
of
preservation
of
that
point
because
the
louisiana
courts
consider
on
death
penalty
cases
all
matters,
whether
objection
was
raised,
and
this
was
dealt
with
on
the
merits
in
the
state
and
federal
habeas
proceedings
as
well
as
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
now,
in
assessing
whether
or
not
the
procedures
used
here
had
a
coercive
tendency,
it
is
necessary
to
consider
that
the
jury
in
a
capital
sentencing
hearing
is
peculiarly
sensitive
to
being
swayed
by
pressures
from
the
trial
judge.
unlike
a
guilt
determination,
where
a
jury
is
determining,
based
on
what
it
sees
and
hears,
some
objective
fact
in
deciding
whether
to
impose
the
death
penalty
the
jurors
are
formulating
a
reasoned
moral
response
and
engaging
in
highly
subjective,
unique,
individualized
assessment
of
whether
a
particular
person
deserves
to
die,
and
here
the
reliability
of
this
sensitive
and
unique
procedure
and
inquiry
was
threatened
by
the
pressure
which
was
inevitably
placed
on
those
four
minority
jurors
and
later
one
lone
juror
who
had
to
publicly
identify
themselves
as
being
opposed
to
the
continuation
of
deliberations.
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
david
klingsberg
we
don't
know
for
sure,
but
we
know
this--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--well,
we
know,
your
honor,
that
there
were
some
jurors
who
opposed
the
death
penalty
being
recommended
in
this
case.
now,
who
were
those
jurors?
it
is
hypothetically
possible
that
they
were
on
one
side
or
the
other,
but
logic
dictates
that
the
jurors
who
said
let's
stop
deliberation,
which
under
the
louisiana
statute
meant
that
a
life
sentence
would
be
imposed,
that
among
those
jurors
were
the
jurors
who
opposed
the
death
sentence
being
recommended
in
this
case.
mr.
david
klingsberg
well,
one
might
draw
an
analogy,
your
honor,
to
the
adams
versus
texas
situation
where
this
court
said
that
it
was
hypothetically
possible
that
the
juror
who
stated
his
views
on
the
death
penalty
might
be
believing
in
an
eye
for
an
eye,
but
it
was
undeniable
and
logical
that
among
the
jurors
who
identified
themselves
as
being
subject
to
influence
by
the
death
penalty
were
likely
to
be
those
who
opposed
it,
and
i
think
the
same
logic
would
prevail
in
this
particular
case.
moreover,
as
justice
stone
indicated
in
brasfield--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--one
can
say,
and
all
we
need
to
establish
here
is
a
risk
or
a
probability
that
there
was
an
improper
influence
on
the
jury,
that
when
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
if
they
voted
to
stop
deliberations
or
if
they
couldn't
reach
an
agreement
that
a
life
sentence
would
be
imposed,
and
then
the
court
engaged
in
these
repetitive
procedures
and
didn't
call
a
halt,
that
a
message
was
coming
from
the
judge
that
the
judge
favored
the
death
penalty,
and
this
was
emphasized
in
the
modified
allen
charge
where
the
judge
said
the
jury
should
have
the
objective
of
reaching
a
just
verdict,
a
verdict
only
being
necessary
to
impose
death,
cessation
of
deliberations
leading
to
an
imposition
of
life
sentence.
mr.
david
klingsberg
well,
as
justice
stone
recognized
in
the
brasfield
case
and
chieft
justice
burger
recognized
in
gypsum,
there
is
no
way
to
ascertain
for
sure
what
the
effect
of
these
practices
are
on
the
jurors,
and
what
this
court
has
to
ascertain,
and
this
is
consonant
with
the
court's
death
penalty
jurisprudence
is
whether
there
was
a
risk.
in
this
case
we
certainly
submit
that
there
was
a
risk.
and
the
risk
was
especially
serious
in
light
of
the
finality
of
the
death
sentence.
as
the
court
indicated
in
booth
against
maryland
regarding
victim
impact
statements,
the
court
must
avoid
the
risk
that
a
death
sentence
will
be
based
on
considerations
that
are
constitutionally
irrelevant
or
impermissible.
an
analogy
may
be
drawn
to
the
bruten
case
or
the
recent
cruz
case
this
court
decided
where
the
court
also
talked
about
risks,
and
the
consequences
of
failure
so
vital
to
the
defendant
that
the
practical
and
human
limitations
on
the
jury
system
cannot
be
ignored,
so
that
if
this
one
lone
juror
was
opposed
to
the
death
sentence,
and
it
is
apparent
that
somebody
was,
because
otherwise
there
would
have
been
a
unanimous
verdict,
so
that
would
indicate
that
that
juror
was
one
who
indicated
that
there
should
be
a
cessation,
and
therefore
there
should
be
a
life
sentence.
certainly
he
was
under
a
great
deal
of
pressure,
having
put
his
name
down
on
a
piece
of
paper,
with
the
risk
of
that
being
public,
and
was
in
a
particularly
sensitive
situation
when
the
judge
delivered
the
allen
charge.
mr.
david
klingsberg
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--that--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--we
can't
ever
know
for
sure
in
these
situations,
and
that
is
why
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
it
is
going
to
examine
into
the
probability
of
improper
influence
on
the
jury.
the
court
is
going
to
examine
into
the
nature
of
the
procedures
and
to
ascertain
whether
those
procedures
are
inherently
coercive,
and
also
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
procedure
serves
any
useful
purpose.
in
gardner,
for
example,
dealing
with
the
pre-sentence
reports,
the
court
said
there
was
insufficient
state
interest
of
purpose
in
not
disclosing
the
pre-sentence
report,
and
in
adams
against
texas
and
in
turner
v.
murray
the
court
has
always
inquired
in,
for
example,
to
the
ease
with
which
the
risk
could
have
been
miminized.
here
the
risk
could
have
been
minimized
very
easily.
the
trial
judge
could
have
ascertained
the
jury
situation
without
counting,
without
public
identification,
and
the
court
simply
could
have
avoided
the
blasting
charge,
and
particularly
in
light
of
the
louisiana
code
provision
which
said
that
if
there
is
no
unanimity
a
life
sentence
is
then
imposed,
and
there
is
no
need
to
have
a
retrial,
as
you
would
in
a
guilt
phase
trial.
the
court
undertook
a
practice
which
was
inherently
coercive,
had
a
potential
for
coercion,
without
any
useful
purpose.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor,
although--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
compared,
for
example,
to
brasfield,
there
the
court
did
not
ascertain
which
side
each
one
on
the
count
was.
here,
we
knew
which
jurors
wanted
to
continue,
which
jurors
didn't
want
to
continue,
and
there
were
two
polls,
and
it
was
followed
by
the
admonition
to
come
and
reach
a
just
verdict,
and
under
those
circumstances
i
would
respectfully
submit
not
that
allen
charges
should
be
banned
in
all
cases,
for
example,
in
a
guilt
phase
trial
where
the
societal
purpose
to
do
so,
avoiding
retrials,
but
that
in
a
sentencing
phase
of
a
capital
punishment
situation
the
court
should
impose
some
limits.
those
limits
are
not
intrusive,
and
do
not...
would
not
interfere
with
the
effective
conduct
of
sentencing
phase
proceedings,
particularly
where
you
have
a
statute,
as
you
do
in
louisiana,
as
you
do
in
three
other
states,
florida
and
others
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
where
supreme
courts
have
held
that
giving
an
allen
charge
in
the
face
of
such
a
statute
has
a
tendency
to
coerce
and
have
reversed
death
sentences.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
turn
to
the
second
point,
which
is
that
at
the
end
of
the
guilt
or
innocence
phase
trial
the
court
instructed
the
jury
in
accordance
with
the
louisiana
code
that
in
order
to
convict
for
first
degree
murder
it
must
find
that
the
defendant
had
a
specific
intent
to
kill
or
inflict
bodily
harm
on
more
than
one
person.
the
trial
judge
also
cautioned
the
jury
at
the
guilt
phase,
and
this
is
important
because
it
shows
that
in
making
this
finding
the
jury
was
not
making
the
individualized
assessment
of
whether
or
not
the
death
sentence
was
reasonably
justified
during
the
guilt
phase,
the
trial
judge
said,
you
are
not
to
discuss
in
any
way
the
possibility
of
any
penalties
whatsoever.
it
is
only
in
the
event
the
jury
reaches
a
verdict
of
first
degree
murder
that
there
is
any
subsequent
hearing
dealing
with
the
penalty.
at
the
separate
sentencing
hearing,
the
prosecutor
told
the
jury
that
one
of
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
on
which
the
state
was
relying
was
that
the
offender
knowingly
created
a
risk
of
death
or
great
bodily
harm
to
more
than
one
person,
and
then
said,
now
you
will
notice
that
is
also
an
element
of
first
degree
murder
that
you
have
already
found
in
this
case.
on
two
of
the
counts
that
was
the
only
aggravating
circumstance
found,
and
on
the
other
count
a
second
circumstance
was
found
and
set
aside
by
the
supreme
court
of
lousiana
so
that
the
sole
aggravating
circumstance
supporting
the
death
sentence
was
the
same
as
the
element
already
found,
as
the
prosecutor
told
the
jury,
in
order
to
convict
for
first
degree
murder--
based
on
these
facts,
we
contend
that
as
applied
to
petitioner,
the
louisiana
capital
punishment
scheme
failed
to
meet
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
requirement
of
providing
a
meaningful
basis
for
distinguishing
the
cases
in
which
the
death
penalty
is
imposed
from
those
in
which
it
is
not.
following
furman,
louisiana
enacted
a
mandatory
scheme
which
was
struck
down
in
roberts
where
the
court,
the
plurality
opinion
said
that
this
procedure
lacks
standards
to
guide
the
jury
in
selecting
among
first
degree
murderers.
and
that
standard
is
not
met
by
the
circumstances
here.
and
the
court
said
as
to
the
north
carolina
scheme
in
woodson,
"there
are
no
standards
provided
to
guide
the
jury
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
to
select
those
first
degree
murderers
who
will
receive
the
death
sentence.
"
now,
louisiana
sought
to
cure
this
deficiency
by
requiring
at
least
one
statutory
aggravating
circumstanace
to
be
found
at
the
sentencing
stage,
modeling
its
scheme
after
gray,
and
as
this
court
stated
in
zant,
the
approval
in
gregg
of
georgia's
capital
punishment
scheme
rested
on
the
feature
being
that
the
jury
was
required
to
find
at
least
one
valid
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
and
to
identify
it
in
writing.
not
only
was
it
essential
to
have
aggravating
circumstances,
but
a
fundamental
requirement
was
that
each
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
satisfy
a
constitutional
standard
derived
from
the
principles
of
furman.
the
court
would
not
have
been
concerned
with
the
standards
for
aggravating
circumstance
if
that
were
not
an
essential
element
of
a
constitutional
death
sentence.
and
as
the
court
said
in
zant,
the
aggravating
circumstance
must
genuinely
narrow
the
class
of
persons
eligible
and
must
reasonably
justify
the
imposition
of
a
more
severe
sentence.
since,
as
this
court
held,
the
aggravating
circumstance
must
reasonably
justify
the
imposition
of
a
more
severe
sentence
on
petitioner
than
others
found
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
that
narrowing
and
channeling
function
cannot
be
fulfilled
meaningfully
where
precisely
the
same
circumstance
is
an
element
of
the
finding
of
guilt
of
first
degree
murder
in
the
first
place.
mr.
david
klingsberg
as
this
court
recognized
in
zant,
your
honor,
it
is
the
aggravating
circumstance
which
provides
the
narrowing
function.
it
is
the
aggravating
circumstance
which
must
be
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
identified,
thus
creating
this
threshold
narrowing
or
gatekeeping
function.
then
the
jury
goes
on,
according
to
the
statute,
and
just
considers
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
david
klingsberg
well,
in
jurek
there
was
some
suggestion
in
the
court's
opinion
that
some
narrowing
occurred
at
the
guilt
phase.
however,
there
were
these
three
questions
under
the
texas
statute
which
had
to
be
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
in
three
or
four
subsequent
decisions
which
we
cite
this
court
has
said,
those
three
questions
are,
and
indeed
they
are,
equivalent
to
finding
aggravating
circumstances.
now,
is
it
possible
constitutionally
for
a
legislature
to
say,
we
are
only
going
to
do
the
narrowing
at
the
field
phase?
well,
that
is
not
what
louisiana
did
here,
and
the
jury
here
was
not
engaged
in
the
kind
of
individual
assessment,
subjective
inquiry,
and
so
forth
which
this
court
has
held
must
be
made
in
the
sentencing
hearing.
they
were
not
focusing
on
guilt.
mr.
david
klingsberg
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor,
but
number
one,
this
court
has
never
held
that
it
would
be
constitutional
to
have,
say,
a
mandatory
statute
that
certain
types
of
crimes
are
mandated
to
first
degree
murder
and
only
in
mitigating
circumstances,
because
the
jury
here
just
has
to
consider
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes.
there
was
also
a
case
of
baldwin
against
alabama,
where
the
judge
had
to
make
an
independent
finding
of
the
aggravating
circumstance
which
was
the
same
as
at
the
earlier
phase,
but
there
you
had
a
separate
body,
a
judge
who
was
able
to
focus
on
what
he
was
doing,
who
wasn't
told
by
the
prosecutor
that
he
already
made
the
finding
so
he
didn't
have
to
make
it
again.
here
what
we
have
is
basically
standardless
and
unchannelled--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--the
only
thing
that
the
court
decided
in
that
case--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--yes.
the
court's
analysis
was
focused
on
whether
all
mitigating
circumstances,
statutory
or
nonstatutory,
should
be
permitted,
and
this
court
in
a
long
series
of
opinions
has
held
repeatedly
that
there
should
not
be
a
limitation
on
the
mitigating
circumstances
to
be
considered,
and
that
human
decency
requires
that.
that
is
quite
different
from
saying,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
analysis
on
that
case
which
says
that
there
does
not
have
to
be
something,
some
element,
some
keystone
which
performs
this
threshold
narrowing
and
gatekeeping
function
in
the
context
where
the
jury
is
focusing.
mr.
david
klingsberg
the
nevada
statute
would
be
constitutional
if
it
provides
at
some
point
when
the
jury
has
in
mind
that
it
is
engaged
in,
or
a
judge
has
in
mind
that
he
is
engaged
in
a
sentencing
function
and
engaged
in
the
kind
of
individual
assessment
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
is
required
for
capital
punishment
sentencing,
that
there
is
some
narrowing,
some
principled
narrowing,
some
standards.
mr.
david
klingsberg
in
my
analysis,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
constitutional
unless
the
jury
has
to
make
some
finding
at
a
time
when
it
is
focusing
on
death
sentence
or
not,
that
there
is
some
standard,
some
finding
that
it
has
to
make
apart
from
just
going
out
and
considering
all
the
mitigating
circumstances
that
there
are,
which
is
a
totally
discretionary
activity.
there
has
to
be
first,
as
the
court
said
in
zant,
a
channeling,
narrowing,
and
going
back
to
furman,
that
has
to
be
principled,
it
has
to
be
based
on
standards.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
for
rebuttal
if
i
may,
your
honor.
mr.
david
klingsberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
sumner
case
which
your
honor
was
questioning
me
about.
mr.
david
klingsberg
the
basis
for
our
claim,
your
honor,
is
that
the
jury
did
not
meaningfully
undertake
to
engage
in
a
fresh
finding
of
fact
regarding
this
aggravating
circumstance,
and
where
you
have
a
jury
which
deliberated
for
ten
hours
it
certainly
cannot
be
a
foregone
conclusion
that
if
they
had
been
directed
to
make
a
meaningful
finding
and
hadn't
been
told
by
the
prosecutor
that
they
had
already
found
that
so
they
don't
have
to
bother
with
it
again,
what
that
result
might
be,
and
where
there
is
a
legal
element
which
is
lacking
in
the
procedure,
particularly
in
a
death
sentence
case,
that
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
the
kind
of
thing,
as
the
court
indicated,
for
example,
in
gray
against
mississippi,
that
should
be...
that
is
so
basic
that
it
should
not
be
treated
as
a
harmless
error
type
of
situation.
if
i
may
just
say
a
word
about
the
sumner
case,
which
your
honor
asked
me
about
earlier,
the
court
there
in
its
analysis
as
well
as
its
holding
focused
only
on
the
discretionary
aspect
of
the
proceeding,
that
is,
that
mitigating
circumstances
regarding
character
and
record
of
the
offender
and
so
forth
were
not
allowed
to
be
considered,
and
neither
the
court's
analysis
nor
the
holding
focused
on
whether,
if
there
had
been
mitigating
circumstances
allowed,
and
you
just
have
sitting
out
there
a
mandatory
death
sentence
in
a
particular
circumstance,
and
there
it
was
extremely
narrow,
only
where
someone
is
serving
a
life
sentence,
and
you
had
mitigating
circumstances,
whether
or
not
the
court
would
nevertheless
continue
to
hold,
as
it
has
emphasized
in
numerous
cases
since
furman,
that
there
is
a
necessity
for
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
a
specified
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
in
order
to
perform
this
narrowing
and
channeling
function.
in
nevada,
there
was
an
indication
that
the
statute
defined
capital
murder,
and
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
jury
when
it
was
considering
whether
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
capital
murder
from
the
decision,
the
court
didn't
focus
on
it,
whether
the
jury
was
engaged
in
the
individualized
assessment
and
process
of
determining
whether
the
death
sentence
was
reasonably
justified.
indeed,
it
may
well
have
done
so,
but
in
our
case
it
is
clear
that
the
jury
was
told
at
the
guilt
phase
that
it
is
not
to
consider
sentencing,
and
it
is
not
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
process
of
deciding
whether
death
was
reasonably
justified.
it
is
clear
from,
for
example,
adams
against
texas,
from
zant,
that
the
process
of
assessing
or
considering
mitigating
circumstances
involves
a
wide
range
of
discretion.
in
the
furman
case
and
all
the
cases
since
then
have
indicated
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
procedure,
some
element,
some
keystone
for
channeling
and
narrowing
on
the
basis
of
standards
on
a
reasonable
basis
there
is
discretion,
and
that,
we
submit,
was
not
done
here.
