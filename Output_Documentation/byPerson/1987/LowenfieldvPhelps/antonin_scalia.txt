justice
scalia
when
you
said
minority,
do
we
know
that
the
four
who
said
that
there
would
be
no
use
in
continuing
were
the
four,
were
four
who
were
voting
against
the
death
penalty?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
i
might
have
been
in
the
majority
and
thought
there
would
be
no
use
going
any
further.
justice
scalia
i
don't
see
why
logic
would
dictate
that,
unless
you
assumed
that
the
jury
was
not
following
the
court's
instructions,
which
we
normally
don't
assume.
the
court
didn't
ask
them,
how
many
of
you
want
to
quit
now,
so
that,
you
know,
so
that
you
will
prevail.
the
court
asked
them,
you
know,
search
your
soul,
really,
do
you
think
it
is
any
use
going
on,
and
it
may
well
be
that
someone
who
was
opposing
the
death
penalty
thought,
we
haven't
talked
it
out
all
the
way,
just
as
someone
who
was
in
favor
of
it
might
have
thought,
it
is
no
use
going
on
further,
the
people
opposed
are
so
stubborn
that
nothing
will
come
of
it.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
assume
that,
you
know.
justice
scalia
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
it
goes
from
just
four
to
one
after
the
second
vote?
i
mean,
you
obviously
have
some
of
the
people
who...
apparently
they
hadn't
changed
their
views
on
the
death
penalty
in
the
interim.
there
had
been
no
more
deliberations.
and
yet
some
of
them
must
have
voted
in
the
second
vote
to
say
we
will...
it
would
be
worthwhile
to
deliberate
further.
so
if
some
of
them
were
there
in
the
second
vote,
i
don't
know
how
one
can
say
that
none
of
them
were
there
in
the
first
vote.
justice
scalia
that
may
be.
i
am
not
saying
that
that
argument
is
gone.
i
am
just
saying
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
you
can
categorically
say
that
one
of
the
indications
of
pressure
is
that
those
who
were
voting
against
the
death
penalty
were
singled
out.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
you
can
say
that
the
four
were
the
four
who
were
voting
against
the
death
penalty.
justice
scalia
again,
we
don't
really
know
that.
we
don't
know
that
there
was
one
juror
at
that
stage
who
was
waivering,
do
we?
all
we
know
is
that
there
was
one
juror
who
thought
that
further
deliberations
wouldn't
help.
justice
scalia
that
may
have
been
one
of
the...
the
jury
may
have
been
split
eleven
to
one
in
favor
of
capital
punishment.
one
of
the
eleven
may
have
thought
that
this
one
fellow
who
had
been
opposed
was
so
stubborn
that
it
was
no
use
talking
to
this
thickhead
any
more.
whereas
the
supposed
thickhead
himself
might
have
thought,
you
know,
i'm
a
pretty
open
fellow,
and
i'd
like
to
talk
about
it.
we
don't
know
that
that's
not
the
case,
do
we?
justice
scalia
you
are
just
assuming
that
the
one
individual
is
the
one
that
was
voting
against
capital
punishment.
we
don't
really
know
that.
justice
scalia
you
acknowledge,
at
least,
mr.
klingsberg,
that
it
is
a
lot
less
threatening
to
the
jury
for
the
judge
to
look
at
them
and
say,
how
many
of
you
think
it
will
be
of
any
use
to
deliberate
further
than
it
is
to
say
to
them,
how
many
of
you
voted
against,
you
know,
how
many
of
you
are
in
the
minority
voting
against
the
majority
verdict?
that
is
a
lot
more
threatening,
isn't
it,
a
question?
justice
scalia
and
that
is
not
the
question
that
was
asked
here.
justice
scalia
we
didn't
hold
that,
but
on
the
other
hand,
last
term
we
had
a
case
somewhere
in
which
the
issue
was
precisely
that.
justice
scalia
it
was
a
much
easier
case.
what
it
was
was
a
statute
that
said,
if
you
are
serving
a
life
sentence
without
the
possibility
of
parole
and
commit
first
degree
murder,
you
automatically
are
subjected
to
capital
punishment.
we
struck
that
down,
but
only
because...
the
reason
we
struck
it
down
was
that
the
statute
did
not
allow
mitigating
circumstances
to
be
considered.
what
you
are
saying
is,
that
statute
was
bad
on
its
face
and
mitigating
circumstances
are
not
because
it
didn't
allow
aggravating
circumstances
to
be
considered.
but
we
made
no
mention
of
that.
it
seemed
like
a
harder
case
than
you
now
tell
us
it
really
was.
justice
scalia
mr.
klingsberg,
before
you
get
to
that,
i
have
a
question
about,
i
don't
know,
i
guess
it
almost
goes
to
standing
to
complain
about
the
absence
of
aggravating
circumstances.
i
mean,
i
can...
assuming
that
it
is
the
law
that
juries
must
be
allowed
to
consider
both
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
how
could
violation
of
that
in
this
case
possibly
hurt
your
client?
it
seems
to
me
you
are
in
the
posture
of
coming
before
us
and
saying,
my
client
is
wronged
because
this
jury
was
not
allowed
to
consider
the
fact
that
he
tortured
each
of
these
people
before
he
killed
them.
now,
the
jury...
you
were
certainly
allowed
to
tell
the
jury,
my
client
did
not
torture
each
of
these
people
before
he
killed
them.
he
killed
them
as
cleanly
and
quickly
as
possible.
but
you
are
coming
before
us
and
the
graveman
of
your
complaint
is
that...
what,
that
you
were
not
allowed
to
tell
the
jury
how
cruel
your
client
was,
or
that
the
prosecutor
was
not
allowed
to
tell
the
jury
how
cruel
your
client
was?
why
do
you
have
any
standing
to
complain
about
the
jury's...
i
would
think
you
would
delight
in
the
fact
that
the
jury
cannot
consider
aggravating
circumstances.
