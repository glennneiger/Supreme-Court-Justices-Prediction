justice
marshall
--would
he
have
given
the
allen
charge
if
it
were
eleven
to
one
for
acquittal?
justice
marshall
i
thought
that
the
defense
did
make
one
objection
to
that
charge.
he
said
that
he
would
request
that
the
court
specifically
state
to
the
jury
that
there
is
no
obligation
under
the
law
that
they
reach
a
verdict,
and
that
was
denied,
so
he
didn't
approve
the
whole
charge,
did
he?
justice
marshall
he
did
object
to
it.
justice
marshall
all
right,
that--
justice
marshall
--when
it
was
eleven
to
one
there
was
automatically
going
to
be
life
imprisonment.
justice
marshall
if
it
had
stayed
eleven
to
one.
justice
marshall
so
knowing
that,
the
judge
gave
the
allen
charge.
justice
marshall
knowing
that
the
jury
had
already
given
him
life
imprisonment.
