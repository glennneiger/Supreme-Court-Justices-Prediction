justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
since
you
have
been
interrupted,
on
this
point
about,
we
don't
know
the
specifics
of
the
stipulation,
but
generally
the
procedures
to
be
followed,
is
it
your
understanding
that
the
stipulation
contemplated
that
the
jurors
who
voted
each
way
on
this
issue
would
be
identified?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
louisiana
procedure
at
the
sentending
phase?
i
know
the
statute
provides
that
any
other
relevant
mitigating
circumstance
may
be
received.
does
the
statute
impose
any
requirement
on
the
trial
judge
with
respect
to
instructions
pertaining
to
mitigating
circumstances?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
at
that
point,
i
asked
your
opponent
this,
too,
but
on
page
52
there
is
a
description.
mr.
lentini
says,
"yes,
your
honor",
and
then
there
are
a
couple
of
paragraphs.
i
gather
that
is
still
mr.
lentini
talking.
and
he
says
that
each
juror
will
have
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
they
can
write
their
opinion
concerning
the
advisability
of
further
deliberation.
where
does
the
record
show
that
it
was
contemplated
that
the
jurors
would
be
identified?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
that
is
polling
them
after
they
have
returned
a
verdict.
that
is
restricted
to
the
procedure
for
polling
after
a
verdict
has
come
in.
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
at
least
as
far
as
the
record
tells
us
about
the
stipulation,
i
don't
find
that
there
was
a
stipulation
that
the
names
of
the
jurors
would
appear
on
these
pieces
of
paper.
i
understand
that
is
done
in
polling
juries,
but
this
is
a
different
situation.
justice
stevens
but
mr....
but
there
was
none
of
that
in
braswell,
either.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
louisiana
procedure?
is
it
permissible
as
a
matter
of
state
law
for
the
trial
judge
to
indicate
to
the
sentencing
jury
in
a
case
like
this
what
he
feels
the
appropriate
penalty
would
be?
justice
stevens
he
must
maintain
a
neutral
aspect
with
regard
to
that?
