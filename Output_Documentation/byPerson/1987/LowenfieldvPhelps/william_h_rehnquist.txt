chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
klingsberg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question?
how
do
you
distinguish
the
court's
analysis
in
the
nevada
statute
last
year
struck
down
because
it
failed
to
consider
mitigating
circumstances?
there
was
no
intimation
that
the
mandatory
aspect
in
the
court's
opinion
would
have
been
bad
had
mitigating
circumstances
been
allowed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
am
talking
about
the
court's
analysis,
not
what
it
decided.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
your
view,
would
the
nevada
statute
have
been
unconstitutional
even
though
it
allowed
for
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
klingsberg,
i
wonder
if
you
could
answer
the
question
more
specifically.
supposing
the
nevada
statute
stood
just
as
it
did,
a
lifer
who
commits
murder
suffers
the
death
penalty,
but
the
statute
goes
on
to
say
in
my
hypothesis,
unlike
the
actual
nevada,
the
jury
may
consider
any
mitigating
circumstances.
would
that
be
constitutional
in
your
analysis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
thank
you,
mr.
klingsberg.
mr.
mamoulides,
we
will
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mamoulides.
mr.
klingsberg,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klingsberg.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
two
opinions
for
the
court
to
announce.
the
first
is
no.
86-6867,
lowenfield
against
phelps.
in
this
case
petitioner,
leslie
lowenfield
was
charged
in
louisiana
with
murdering
of
five
people.
a
louisiana
jury
found
him
guilty
on
three
counts
of
first
degree
murder
and
during
the
trial
of
several
hours
in
the
sentencing
deliberations
that
ensued,
the
jury
sent
a
note
to
the
judge,
indicating
there
were
having
difficulty
reaching
a
verdict.
the
judge
polled
the
jury
as
to
whether
further
deliberations
might
be
fruitful
and
the
substantial
majority
of
the
jurors
answered
in
the
affirmative.
the
judge
proceeded
to
instruct
the
jury
that
it
should
attempt
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict
but
remind
that
the
jurors
not
to
surrender
their
honest
beliefs.
the
jury
resumed
deliberation
in
a
short
time
later
and
returned
the
verdict
sentencing
petitioner
to
death
on
all
three
counts
of
first
degree
murder.
in
support
of
these
three
sentences,
the
jury
found
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
of
knowingly
creating
a
risk
of
death
or
great
bodily
harm
to
more
than
one
person.
after
exhausting
state
remedies,
the
petitioner
sought
federal
habeas
corpus.
he
lost
in
the
federal
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
he
brought
the
two
claims
raised
below
here,
one
that
the
louisiana
system
of
capital
punishment
does
not
adequately
confine
the
jury's
discretion;
and
two,
that
the
judges
charged
an
inquiry
of
the
jury
coerce
the
verdict.
as
explained
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reject
both
of
these
claims.
we
conclude
that
under
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
here
the
jury
was
not
coerced
into
rendering
its
verdict
at
the
sentencing
phase.
a
trial
judge
has
allowed
to
deliver
a
supplemental
charge,
urging
a
jury
to
reach
a
verdict
even
at
the
death
penalty
sentencing
stage,
and
the
inquiries
made
of
the
jurors
as
to
the
likely
value
of
further
deliberation
did
not
inform
the
trial
court
as
to
the
numerical
division
of
the
jury
on
the
merits
and
were
not
improper.
we
also
reject
petitioner's
claim
of
the
use
of
an
element
of
the
offense
as
to
the
sole
aggravating
circumstance
in
support
of
a
death
sense
fails
adequately
to
perform
the
constitutionally
mandated
function
of
narrowing
the
class
of
murderers
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
accordingly
affirmed.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan
has
joined;
justice
stevens
has
joined
the
part
of
the
court's
opinion
and
a
part
justice
marshall's
dissenting
opinion.
