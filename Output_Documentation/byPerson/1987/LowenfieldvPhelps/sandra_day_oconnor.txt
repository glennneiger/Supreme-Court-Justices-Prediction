justice
o'connor
was
any
specific
objection
made
on
the
record
by
the
petitioner
to
the
polling
of
the
jurors
by
name?
justice
o'connor
that
was
not
raised
in
the
fifth
circuit,
either?
justice
o'connor
well,
why
isn't
that
narrowing
provided
by
the
fact
that
the
jurors
have
to
consider
mitigating
circumstances
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
and
tailor
the
decision
to
this
individual
after
consideration
of
those
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
zant
and
jurek
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
sentencer
has
to
consider
the
aggravating
circumstances
as
opposed
to
having
the
legislative
body
define
which
aggravating
circumstances
would
narrow?
justice
o'connor
they
certainly
were
with
regard
to
mitigation,
weren't
they?
justice
o'connor
they
certainly
were
with

to
mitigating
circumstances.
