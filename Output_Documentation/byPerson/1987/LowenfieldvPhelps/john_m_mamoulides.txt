mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
address
at
this
time
the
second
phase
of
the
two
issues,
the
constitutionality
of
the
louisiana
state
statute
on
the
death
penalty,
and
go
back
to
the
first
issue
afterwards.
the
allegations
by
petitioner
make
it
clear
that
they
feel
that
the
louisiana
statute
should
fall.
louisiana
is
one
of
those
states
that
chose
to
narrow
the
threshold
for
those
crimes
that
can
be
determined
to
be
and
carry
with
them
the
possibility
of
a
death
sentence
in
the
definitive
stage
of
their
statute,
and
in
doing
so
they...
in
this
definitive
stage
louisiana
has
said
that
capital
murder,
or
in
this
case
first
degree
murder,
is
defined
as
three
circumstances
or
facts.
those
facts,
of
those
three
facts...
correction,
five
circumstances
or
facts...
this
case
deals
with
the
third
factor,
that
is,
the
intentional
killing
of
a
person
with
a
specific
intent
to
kill
or
inflict
great
bodily
harm
to
one
or
more
persons...
to
more
than
one
person,
your
honor.
i
am
sorry.
the
state
statute
by
setting
that
out
has
in
effect
narrowed
the
threshold,
the
requirement
of
the
eighth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
by
saying
that
you
can
only
have
first
degree
murder
when
you
find
this
particular
small,
narrow
threshold.
that
is,
you
must
find
first
the
guilt
of
someone
who
commits
this
crime.
we
maintain
that
that,
in
the
case
of
zant
and
jurek
and
gregg,
that
the
states
were
not
required
to
have
the
aggravating
circumstances
per
se
in
the
death
penalty
phase.
louisiana
is
a
bifurcated
state.
that
is
to
say,
we
have
a
statute
of
the
criminal
court...
correction,
of
the
criminal
code
which
sets
out
in
article
905
those
provisions
which
are
required
for
a
sentencing
hearing.
we
maintain
that
the
narrowing
necessary
to
meet
eighth
amendment
statute
was
done
in
the
definitional
stage
of
the
crime,
particularly
in
this
particular
crime.
after
jurek,
zant
came,
and
we
maintain
that
this
narrowing
is
sufficient
in
louisiana.
the
criminal
code
of
procedure,
which
is
a
procedure
act,
sets
out
the
policy
and
the
rules
for
governing
the
sentencing
phase
of
the
louisiana
statute.
and
in
the
louisiana
statute
in
the
sentencing
phase
the
court
goes
further
than
just
mitigating
circumstances.
it
adds,
the
law
adds
that
the
jury
must
consider,
it
must
find
at
least
one
aggravating
circumstance
from
a
list
of
ten
enumerated
in
the
statute
along
with
a
consideration
of
all
the
mitigating
circumstances
that
are
enumerated
plus
any
other
that
the
defendant
may
present.
we
maintain
that
this
narrowing,
if
you
will,
although
it
may
be
the
same
or
similar
to
the
definitional
phase
of
the
crime
which
is
outlined
in
the
definition
of
the
crime,
although
it
may
be
the
same
or
similar,
its
use
is
different.
the
jury
is
told
that
they
must
find
in
writing
one,
at
least
one
aggravating
circumstance.
the
louisiana
sentencing
procedure
forces
that
jury
to
use
as
a
threshold
that
particular
aggravating
circumstance
to
channel
and
focus
its
view
of
the
individuality
of
the
crime
and
the
punishment
of
that
particular
defendant
along
with
all
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
that
are
enumerated
and
any
that
he
may
bring
up.
but
it
is
not
a
requirement
of
the
eighth
amendment,
a
constitutional
requirement,
that
the
state
of
louisiana
must
say
that
this
additional
narrowing,
if
you
will,
must
fall
because
it
is
identical
to,
similar
to
the
initial
narrowing
in
the
definitional
phase
of
the
statute,
which
in
this
case
is
the
killing
of
two
or
more
persons.
we
maintain
that
the
louisiana
statute,
by
having
this
additional
narrowing
in
the
penalty
phase,
goes
beyond
the
requirement
of
what
the
eighth
amendment
maintains
is
necessary.
it
goes
beyond
the
mere
killing
of
people
arbitrarily
or
capriciously.
it
narrows
that
class
to
only
those
death
eligible
persons
who
meet
the
elements
of
the
crime
as
outlined
in
the
definition
of
first
degree
murder,
in
this
case
section
3.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
compared
those
two
particular
statutes
to
being
used
together
in
parallel
with
the
guilt
phase
of
the
definition
phase
being
used
by
the
jury
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
state
must
prove
each
and
every
element
of
the
crime,
and
in
the
definitional
phase
it
is
used
for
guilt
for
the
narrowing
of
the
class
of
persons
who
would
be
death
eligible,
and
in
the
penalty
phase
it
merely
is
a
tool
to
assist
the
jury
in
its
discretion
in
determining
which
defendant
should
die
and
which
should
live.
both
of
these
statutes,
even
though
they
are
similar,
do
not
in
any
way
take
away
the
narrowing
effect
of
the
definition
of
the
crime
of
murder
as
set
out
in
this
particular
case.
the
fact
that
the
aggravating
circumstance
is
the
same
does
not
in
any
way
lessen
the
narrowness
of
the
class,
which
is
all
that
is
required
in
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
the
statute
merely
says
that
the
judge
will
allow
the,
if
i
recall,
will
allow
the
list
of
mitigating
circumstances
and
aggravating
circumstances
to
be
taken
into
the
courtroom,
into
the
deliberation
room
with
them,
and
that
is
a
change
in
louisiana.
it
is
normally
not
done
in
other
charges.
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
the
jury
had
access
to
those
items
while
it
was
deliberating.
now,
your
honor,
turning
to
the
issue
in
the
first
argument
of
petitioner,
that
is,
whether
or
not
there
was
coercion
in
this
case
by
the
court
in
administering
a
modified
allen
charge
and
polling
the
jury,
louisiana
allows
the
use
of
a
modified
allen
charge.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
state
has
a
legitimate
reason,
a
valid
reason
to
use
a
modified
allen
charge
even
in
a
sentencing
procedure.
after
all,
jurors
have
taken
an
oath,
they
have
taken
an
oath
of
responsibility
to
reach
a
verdict,
to
attempt
to
reach
a
verdict.
in
a
capital
case,
that
oath
is
even
more
severe
because
they
are
deciding
life
or
death
of
an
individual.
the
jury
as
a
representative
of
the
people,
maybe
the
conscience
of
the
community,
has
in
fact
the
life
or
death
of
an
individual
person
in
their
hands.
in
louisiana,
the
judge
in
this
case
was
well
within
his
discretion
when
for
the
first
time
this
jury
indicated
that
it
had
any
problem
at
all,
he
called
in...
and
that
was
done
by
virtue
of
the
note
that
came
in
at
3:00
o'clock
on
the
afternoon
of
the
16th
of
april,
the
judge
then
called
the
defense
attorney
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
to
discuss
how
they
would
handle
the
note.
on
page
52
of
the
joint
appendix
you
will
see
discussion
about
the
stipulation.
it
was
stipulated
between
counsel
and
the
judge
that
this
procedure
of
polling
would
be
used.
it
was
stipulated
that
he
would
call
the
jurors
in,
that
they
would
be
asked
whether
or
not
any
further
deliberation
would
be
useful,
and
it
was
further
stipulated
that
the
charge
to
be
given
if
the
court
determined
that
there
would
be
more
deliberation
would
be
the
last
portion
of
the
original
charge,
now
referred
to
as
the
modified
allen
charge.
it
is
important
to
understand
that
this
was
the
first
time
this
jury
had
indicated
it
was
having
any
problem,
and
the
charge,
the
so-called
allen
charge
was
only
given
one
time
other
than
in
the
original
charge
to
the
jury
when
they
went
out
to
deliberate.
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
it
doesn't
indicate
that.
the
count
was
never
given
to
the
jury.
that
is
the
normal
procedure
in
louisiana.
under
article
812
of
the
louisiana
code
of
criminal
procedure,
in
section
2,
and
i
quote,
"the
procedure
for
the
written
polling
of
the
jury
shall
require
that
the
clerk
hand
to
each
juror
a
separate
piece
of
paper
containing
the
name
of
the
juror
and
the
words
"is
this
your
verdict".
"
now,
in
this
situation
they
weren't
talking
about
a
verdict,
but
there
is
no
other
area
dealing
with
polling
the
jury
except
this
statute.
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
yes,
but
when
they
decided
they
would
poll
the
jury,
it
was
decided
that
it
should
not
be
done
orally
to
identify
them,
that
it
should
be
done
by
them
writing
it
down,
and
the
only
thing
the
judge
had
to
go
on
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
procedure
was
valid
was
article
812,
and
that's
the
reason
the
names
are
put
down.
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
the
stipulation
was
agreed
to
by
counsel,
your
honor.
that
is
all,
and
it
is
in
the
full
record
of
the
proceedings,
and
you
would
find
it
in
the
full
record.
but
the
stipulation
was
agreed
to...
i
think
it
is
in
the
full
record.
i
have
to
correct
myself.
the
stipulation
was
agreed
to
by
the
counsel
as
well
as
the
so-called
allen
charge,
and
what
is
more
important
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
jury
did
not
know
about
it,
and
that
the
time
sequence
that
we
are
talking
about
where
they
talk
about
the
eight
and
four
and
the
eleven
and
one,
what
took
place
in
reality
was,
when
the
tally
was
made,
the
tally
was
made
of
the
eight
and
four,
they
were
talking
to
the
judge
in
open
court.
the
jury
was
in
the
box.
at
that
time
the
defense
attorney
asked
the
judge
that
he
would
like
to
reurge
his
motion
for
a
mistrial.
the
judge
then
ordered
the
jury
removed
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
the
motion
for
the
mistrial.
as
the
jury
left,
it
was
being
removed
for
that
purpose,
almost
immediately
the
second
note
came
saying
that
some
of
the
jurors
misunderstood.
this
is
indicated
in
the
record
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
in
the
supreme
court
decision.
and
that
recount,
the
judge
called
them
back,
put
them
back
in
the
box,
gave
them
the
same
question,
changed
it
slightly
so
that
they
would
not
misunderstand
it,
and
the
count
was
eleven
to
one
to
continue
the
deliberation.
that
is
when
the
judge,
based
on
the
stipulation
of
what
he
would
do,
gave
the
so-called
allen
charge,
which
was
really
a
portion
of
the
original
charge,
and
there
was
no
objection
by
the
defendant.
the
reason
i
bring
up
there
was
no
objection
by
a
defendant
at
that
time
was
not
so
much
that
he
couldn't
object
now
but
to
show
that
there
was
no
atmosphere
of
coercion,
there
was
no
atmosphere
of
this
court
or
this
judge
or
anyone
trying
to
pressure
this
jury.
if
you
look
at
the
allen
charge
that
was
given,
the
judge
reiterates
the
fact
that
this
jury
is
not
required,
if
they
are
unable
to
reach
a
unanimous
decision,
that
the
court
would
sentence
the
defendant
to
life
imprisonment.
further
on,
in
the
bottom
of
the
charge,
the
judge
says,
do
not
surrender
your
honest
belief
merely,
in
effect
merely
for
the
purpose
of
rendering
a
verdict.
he
does
tell
to
go
and
to
talk
to
each
other.
the
thing
that
makes
this
important
is
that
if
we
read
it
as
an
entire...
in
its
entirety
considering
the
circumstance,
it
is
not
anywhere
near
the
objectionable
items
of
so-called
allen
charges
in
the
past
or
in
braswell
cases.
there
was
no
open
counting
of
those
who
were
for
a
death
penalty
or
against
death
penalty.
there
was
no
demand
by
the
judge
that
you
go
out
and
reach
a
verdict.
there
was
no
discussion
that
this
jury,
this
trial
has
been
seven
days
and
cost
a
lot
of
money.
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
there
was
an
open
counting.
there
was
a
count
of
the
minority
and
the
majority.
there
was
none
of
that
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
particular
case
was
the
killing
of
five
people.
this
jury
had
deliberated
and
determined
that
two
of
those
homicides
were
not
first
degree,
but
would
be
manslaughter,
and
that
three
would
be
first
degree
murder.
all
three
were
killed
in
different
methods.
one
lady
got
three
shots,
two
in
the
chest
and
one
in
the
head,
while
she
was
running,
in
the
back
of
the
head,
one
in
the
face,
one
in
the
side
of
the
head.
these
jurors
were
then
instructed
in
the
penalty
phase
that
they
must
consider
death
or
life
imprisonment
on
all
three
of
those
separate
counts.
we
don't
know
what
went
on
in
that
jury
room,
whether
one
juror
said,
well,
i
am
not
interested
in
this
being
a
death
penalty
or
this
not
being
one.
we
don't
really
have
any
idea.
the
question
before
the
court
concerning
coercion
of
this
jury
is
similar
to
the
one
the
court
used
in,
although
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
polling
or
allen
charge,
but
that
the
court
used
in
brown
versus
california,
where
the
entire
instruction
and
the
entire
structure
that
was
given
was
looked
at
to
see
if
a
reasonable
juror
would
have
been
affected
by
this
type
charge
under
these
circumstances.
i
think
not.
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
absolutely,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
in
his
charge
and
in
the
allen
charge
to
be
able
to
say
that
the
judge's
charge
leaned
toward
death
penalty
is
just
not
correct.
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
he
starts
it
off
by
saying
that
if
you
are
unable
to
reach
a
decision
the
state
will
impose
life
imprisonment,
and
if
you
talk
to
the
jurors,
do
not
give
up
your
particular
reason
just
for
the
purpose
of
reaching
a
verdict,
that
is
another
reason
why
the
allen
charge
itself
in
this
case
is
not
and
cannot
and
should
not
be
coercive
or
prohibitive,
because
those
jurors
had
an
oath
and
an
obligation
to
attempt
for
the
purposes
of
the
public
and
their
oath
to
try
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict,
not
to
shirk
that
responsibility
because
it
is
a
tough
question
of
life
and
death.
and
this
judge--
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
--yes,
sir?
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
if
he
knew
that,
your
honor,
no,
but
i
don't
think
anyone
could
have
told
what
the
number
or
the
count
was.
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
well,
what
the
attorney
was
requesting
was
not
proper
and
was
not
legal.
the
judge
could
not
give
that
order
because
the
law
requires
the
jury
to
try
to
reach
a
verdict,
and
if
it
cannot--
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
--yes,
your
honor,
he
objected
to
that
for
the
reason
that
he
wanted--
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
--but
i
don't
think
that
the
charge
or
the
judge's
telling
this
jury
on
several
occasions
that
if
they
could
not
reach
a
verdict
the
state
would
grant
a
unanimous
verdict...
correction,
the
state
would
grant
a
life
imprisonment
verdict
was
something
that
they
didn't
understand.
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
if
they
could
not--
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
--absolutely,
your
honor.
it
would
automatically
be
life
imprisonment.
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
your
honor,
the--
mr.
john
m.
mamoulides
--this
was
the
first
time
this
jury
had
indicated
it
had
any
problems
at
all.
a
judge
is
not
required
on
the
first
sign
of
trouble
to
say
that,
oh,
wait,
we
are
going
to
stop
and
let
you
be
hung.
the
judge
has
an
an
obligation
to
determine
in
his
own
mind,
his
own
discretion,
whether
or
not
this
jury
was
in
fact
hung,
and
the
defense
attorney
and
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
agreed
on
the
method
to
do
it.
once
he
found
it
was
eleven
to
one,
to
deliberate
further,
they
didn't
say,
your
honor,
it
is
hopeless.
they
said,
we
think
eleven
persons
out
of
the
twelve
thought
it
would
be
valuable
to
deliberate
further,
and
he
gave
this
modified,
mild
charge
which
was
given
in
the
original
charge
to
the
jury.
we
find
and
think
that
the
conviction
should
stand,
that
there
was
no
coercion
on
the
part
of
this
court
in
either
the
allen
charge
or
the
polling.
thank
you,
your
honors.
