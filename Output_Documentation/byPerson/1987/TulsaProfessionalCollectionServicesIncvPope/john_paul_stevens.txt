how
is
the
person
supposed
to
do
it
if
the
creditor
doesn't
know
about
the
opening
of
the
estate?
justice
stevens
well,
why
do
they
give
this
exception...
the
exception
for
the
out
of
state
people
is
because
they
don't
read
the
newspapers
that
the
oklahoma
citizens
have
available
to
them.
that's
the
point.
justice
stevens
but
the
ordinary
creditor
has
to
read
all
the
legal
publications
to
protect
himself
or
herself.
justice
stevens
and
we
haven't
talked
much
about
whether
the
statute
is
constitutional.
we've
had
an
interesting
discussion
of
oklahoma
probate
law,
but
do
you
think
the
statute
is
constitutional?
do
you
think
that's
adequate
notice
to
the
average
creditor?
justice
stevens
sixty
days.
justice
stevens
sixty
days
plus
the
period
of
time
between
the
date
of
death
and
the
time
the
publication
is
made.
you
have
a
prompt
estate
opening
and
a
prompt
publication,
it
could
be
a
matter
of
ninety
days,
i
would
assume,
in
a
lot
of
cases.
justice
stevens
it
is
usually
filed
within
a
couple
of
weeks.
justice
stevens
so,
don't
we
have
to,
to
decide
this
case,
assume
that
everybody
knew...
that
she
knew
the
facts
and
could
well
have
given
notice
and
wouldn't
have
slowed
anything
up
at
all
if
she
said,
well,
i
don't
think
the
hospital
bill
is
paid,
i
think
i
ought
to
write
them
a
letter?
justice
stevens
mr.
smith,
is
there
any
provision
in
the
oklahoma
probate
code
that
requires
the
executor
or
the
administrator
to
make
any
kind
of
representation
to
the
court
that
all
known
debts
have
been
paid?
justice
stevens
no.
apart
from
the
requirement
that
those
who
have
filed
claims
have
been
paid.
the
first
clause
of
most
wills
says
and
pay
all
just
debts
and
so
forth.
there's
no
requirement
that
they
have
to
represent
to
the
probate
court
that
that's
been
done,
other
than
those
that
are
actually
filed.
justice
stevens
this
applies,
of
course,
not
just
to
people
doing
business,
but
this
could
have
been
his
cousin
at
the
other
side
of
the
state
who
loaned
him
money.
justice
stevens
so,
it's
not
just
people
that
are
in
business,
it's
any
debt.
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
rose,
if
you
win,
doesn't
the
case
have
to
go
back
for
trial
on
the
question
of
whether
the
administrator
actually
knew
about
the
claim?
justice
stevens
if
the
only
constitutional
requirement
is
that
the
people
who
have
actual
notice
be...
i
mean,
people
of
whom
the
decedent's
representative
actually
knew
to
have
claims,
your
client
would
not
prevail
unless
she
knew
that
there
was
an
outstanding
claim.
justice
stevens
and
that
has
not
yet
been
adjudicated.
