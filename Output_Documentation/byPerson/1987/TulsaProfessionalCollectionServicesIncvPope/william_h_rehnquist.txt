mr.
rose,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
held
otherwise
in
this
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
would
think
particularly
representing
a
collection
agency,
as
you
do,
that
would
be
quite
a
staple
of
their
business.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
was
decided
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
hypothesizes
a
truly
massive
business
of
collection
which
would
extend
to
every
county
in
oklahoma
and
every
county
in
every
other
state
of
the
union.
you
know,
you
would
have
to
have
thousands
of
people
and
presumably
some
of
them
could
be
assigned
to
reading
probate
notices.
chief
justice
rehnquist
didn't
you
say
a
moment
ago,
and
if
you
didn't
say
this,
please,
that
in
mennonite,
we
decided
the
general
notice
question,
although
in
that
particular
case,
the
claimant
had
had
notice,
had
had
actual
notice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
since
that
might
have
taken
place
considerably
later,
is
your
point.
chief
justice
rehnquist
since
the
probate
proceeding
might
have
been
commenced
considerably
after
the
death.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
before
we
got
into
all
the
factual
background
of
the
case,
you
were
beginning
to
say
why
this
was
like
mennonite,
that
you
thought
there
was
a
property
interest
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
in
the
mullane
case,
there
was
an
existing
interest
in
personal
property.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
in
mennonite,
there
was
an
existing
interest
in
real
property.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
here
you
have
what's
traditionally
just
a
claim
in
personam,
a
contract
claim
for
payment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
law
has
always
treated
quite
differently
interests
in
property
as
opposed
to
contractual
interests,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
many,
many
things
certainly
can
be
property
under
our
due
process
decisions
that
are
not
classical
interests
in
personal
property
or
real
property,
but,
nonetheless,
i
think
you
probably
have
to
deal
with
the
proposition
that
traditionally
a
statute
of
limitations
dealing
with
real
property
is
much
longer
than
a
statute
of
limitations
dealing
with
contract
rights
and
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
interest
there,
i
suppose,
of
the
state
is
not
to
ward
off
stale
claims,
but
to
say
that
after
someone
dies,
it's
imperative
to
wind
up
his
affairs
more
rapidly
and
you
simply
relied
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
are
very
few
unsuccessful
probates.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rose.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
rehnquist
just
to
get
in
my
mind
a
couple
of
the
dates
here.
the
date
of
death
was
april
2nd,
1979,
and
the
notice
to
creditors
was
published
in
july
of
that
year?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
first
claim
filed
by
the
collection
agency
here
was
in
october
1983?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
was
the
first
appearance
they
had
made
in
the
probate
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
rose,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rose.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases

86-1013,
lyng

northwest
indian
cemetary
protective
association,
