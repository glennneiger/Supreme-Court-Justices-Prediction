mr.
phillip
k.
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
immediately,
i
would
like
to
address
several
statements
made
by
appellant
hospital,
both
in
their
jurisdictional
statement
in
their
briefs
as
well
as
in
the
oral
argument
just
concluded
that
are
no
where
to
be
found
in
the
record.
these
are
very
pertinent
statements.
the
most
blatant
of
which
is
that
the
personal
representative
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
claim
of
the
hospital
at
the
time
her
husband
died
as
well
as
at
the
time
that
notice
to
creditors
was
published.
for
the
first
six
years
after
the
death
of
the
decedent,
the
appellant
hospital
relied
exclusively
on
the
oklahoma
statute
that
set
out
certain
preferences
and
priorities
of
payment
under
section
594
of
our
probate
code,
and
no
court
thus
far
has
decided
that
that
relieved
them
of
the
burden
of
filing
a
notice
to
creditors,
that
not
until
the
case
had
been
tried
on
that
issue
in
the
original
probate
court,
had
been
heard
by
the
oklahoma
court
of
appeals,
and
upon
petition
for
rehearing
to
the
oklahoma
court
of
appeals,
approximately
august
of
1985,
did
the
appellant
hospital
raise
the
issue
of
due
process.
now,
up
until
that
point,
the
exclusive
question
before
the
court
was
the
question
of
priority
of
payment
of
debts.
the
fact
that
the
personal
representative
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
claim
is
no
where
to
be
found
in
the
record,
and
we
dispute
that
fact,
and
we
have
continually
disputed
it
in
our
brief.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
that's
correct.
it
was
never--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--that's
correct.
there
was
never
an
opportunity
to
try
the
facts
on
the
due
process
issue.
we
have
maintained--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--that's
correct.
we
are
ready
to
meet
that
issue
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
we
maintain
that
she
had
no
knowledge
of
any
claim
pending
at
the
time
either
that
he
died
or
the
time
that
she
published
notice
to
creditors.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
we
do
not
maintain
that
they
knew
of
the
probate
proceeding
at
the
time
that
he
died
or
that
we
gave
them
actual
notice.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
that's
right.
we
don't
know
when
the
hospital
found
out
about
the
probate
proceeding.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
that
was
not
a
claim.
we
disputed,
and
this
has
never
been
a
part
of
the
record,
that
they
ever
filed
a
claim.
in
october
of
1983,
they
made
application
for
the
first
time
during
the
whole
probate
to
compel
the
personal
representative
to
pay
their
claim
based
on
a
priority
of
payments
under
section
594.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
no.
there
is
only
one
sole
heir
and
that
is
the
personal
representative,
the
wife
of
the
deceased,
and
she
had
not
taken
any
distribution.
it
might
be
important
to
get
the
dates
in
order
in
the
record.
it
is
in
the
record
that
the
decedent
was
admitted
to
st.
john
medical
center
on
november
of
1978.
he
never
left
the
hospital
building
until
his
death
on
april
2nd
of
1979.
now,
she
was
appointed
the
personal
representative
and
duly
published
on
july
17th,
1979,
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
the
claims
period
then
ran
until
september
17th,
1979.
actually,
some
five
and
a
half
months
after
the
date
of
death.
and
in
oklahoma,
the
sixty-day
period
does
not
commence
until
the
first
date
of
publication.
it's
not
two
months
from
the
date
of
death.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
there
is
an
exception
as
are
several
exceptions
under
the
non-claims
statute.
one
provides
for
an
out
of
state
creditor.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
sir?
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
right.
but
concerning
out
of
state
creditors,
they
are
exempt
from
the
two-month
time
period.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
there
are
no
exemptions
made
for
in
state
creditors,
just
on
the
basis
that
they
had
no
knowledge.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
no.
we
would
say
that
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
it
under
due
process.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
yes,
sir.
that
is
true.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
he
has
until
the
final
decree
of
distribution,
which
could
be
months
or
years,
depending
on
the
case.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
notice
was
not
given
for
two
reasons.
one,
mrs.
pope
did
not
realize
and
recognize
the
hospital
as
a
creditor
of
the
estate.
two,--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--the
hospital
bill
was
outstanding.
she,
and
this
is
not
in
the
record,
sir,
i
want
to
clarify
that,
she
had
reason
to
believe
in
her
mind
that
the
estate,
including
herself
personally,
would
never
be
liable
for
a
penny
from
this
expense
because
of
insurance.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
yes.
our
firm
was.
i
wasn't
personally.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
i
can't
answer
that
as
far--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--well,
it
wasn't
required
under
the
non-claims
statute.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
no,
sir.
the--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--no.
the
point
could
be
argued
that
an
unscrupulous
personal
representative
could
play
behind
the
laws
and
wait
until
the
filing
period
was
over
and
then
step
in
and
say,
your
bill
is
out
because
you
didn't
file.
in
this
case,
claims
were
paid
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
this
is
not
in
the
record
either,
but
claims
were
paid
and
declared
as
deductions
for
estate
tax
returns,
both
to
the
irs
and
the
oklahoma
tax
commission.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
no,
they
weren't.
they
were
paid
without
having
been
filed.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
yes,
sir,
and
we
didn't
recognize
the
claim
of
the
hospital.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
we
had
no
trouble
with
the
irs
on
that
question
and
received
releases
from
both
tax
entities.
the
reason
i
mentioned
the
deduction
on
the
tax
return
is
that
to
show
the
good
faith
of
mrs.
pope
because
she
did
not
declare
any
money
due
and
owing
to
st.
john
medical
center,
and
for
a
$14,000
deduction,
had
she
known
of
that,
she
would
have
taken
it.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
she
would
have
had
to
pay
it.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
that's
true.
there
would
be
a
potential
if
heirs--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--i
believe
that
public
notice
is
required
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
because
of
the
uncertainty
of
determining
who
and
who
is
not
a
creditor.
i
believe
it
puts
all
of
the
creditors
in
the
same
boat
to
alert
the
public
and
the
creditors
at
large
that
there
is
a
proceeding
which
might
affect
their
interests.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
as
well
as
pay
any
valid
debts.
the--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--that's
correct.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
i
still
believe
that
under
the
oath
of
office
that
an
executor
takes,
they
are
under
a
duty
to
not
only
protect
the
rights
of
the
heirs
and
the
property
interests,
but
also
to
pay
any
valid
debts
of
the
estate.
i
still
believe
that
there
is
a
dual
role
there
to
be
played.
in
this
case,
the
personal
representative
happens
to
be
the
wife
of
the
deceased,
and
there
is
a
close
tie
there.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
that's
true.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
that's
correct.
i
would
also
state
that
the
practice
in
oklahoma
as
well
as
possibly
other
jurisdictions
is
to
pay
claims,
even
though
proper
creditors
claims
are
not
presented,
and
this
is
done
and
while
if
you
have
an
executor
who
has
to
answer
to
some
heirs
who
wouldn't
have
done
that
themselves,
it
is
done
on
a
practical
basis
every
day.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
in
oklahoma,
it
is
the
practice.
the
reason--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--in
oklahoma,
excuse
me,
insurance
payments
continue
to
be
made
by
the
employer
sponsored
insurance
carrier
until
approximately
february
of
1980.
so,
as
to
the
determination
of
the
debt,
not
only
when
he
died,
but
when
she
gave
notice
to
creditors,
she
didn't
know
any
exact
amount
and
i
dare
say
the
hospital
didn't
know
because
it
could
have,
in
fact,
been
paid
off
in
full.
so,
at
best,
it
was
a
contingent
claim
and
provisions
are
made
under
the
same
oklahoma
non-claims
statute,
section
333,
for
contingent
claims,
and
it
provides
that
a
creditor
of
a
contingent
or
unmatured
debt
is
to
present
the
claim
in
that
form
to
the
personal
representative,
and
depending
on
when
the
claim
becomes
due,
depends
how
far
the--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--well,
the
creditor,
we
maintain,
is
supposed
to
monitor
those
accounts
that
they
have
to
collect.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
i
would
assume
because
they
wouldn't
have
access
to
the
newspapers.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
sixty
days.
sounds
like
a
short
stream,
but
it's
not
always
sixty
days.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
the
original
hearing
cannot
be
less
than
ten
days
or
more
than
thirty
days
from
whenever
the
petition
is
filed.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
in
this
case,
it
was
a
period
of
over
five
months
that
they
had
to
file
their
claim.
we
maintain
that
that
is
reasonable
and
the
legislature,
for
some
reason
in
1965,
shortened
the
period
from
four
months
to
two
months,
citing
the
state
purpose
of
expediting
and
closing
estates
as
well
as
the
proper
presentation
of
validation
of
debts.
these
claims
aren't
just
presented
on
a
piece
of
paper.
they
have
to
be
validated.
they
have
to
be
properly
shown
so
that
she
knows
that
she's
paying
a
rightful
debt.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
we
don't
argue
with
the
idea
that
actual
notice
is
preferable
in
most
all
cases.
the
problem,
justice
scalia,
in
a
probate
matter
is
that
who
is
the
known
creditor,
and
that
is
the
problem
here.
she
knew
st.
john's.
she
had
been
there
many
times.
she
knew
their
address.
she
knew
how
to
get
there.
she
knew
how
to
find
their
mailing
address.
but
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
a
known
creditor
of
this
estate,
she
didn't
know
them
in
that
sense
at
all.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
no,
that
has
not
been
tried.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
we
maintain
that
to
do
that
causes
a
burden
upon
personal
representatives
who
are
not
always
the
spouse
of
the
decedent,
to
find
out
exactly
who
the
creditors
are,
and
this
is
a
genuine
problem
where
personal
representatives
who
has
some
times
only
desks
or
drawers
of
papers
to
go
through
in
order
to
determine
who
the
creditors
are.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
not
under
this
statute.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
i
don't
believe
so.
if
you
assume...
just
take
an
example.
let's
say
mr.
pope
had
some
outside
business
interests
and
this
is
not
uncommon
for
people
to
do
this
without
making
it
a
matter
of
record,
let's
assume
that
he
took
loans
out
before
he
died
to
a
person
we'll
call
john
or
a
person
by
the
name
of
mary.
he
didn't
tell
his
wife
about
this.
wasn't
filed
of
record.
these
were
strictly
loans
that
he
chose
to
do
with
what
he
pleased,
but
he
died
and
neither
one
of
them
were
repaid.
he
happened
to
leave
some
notes
about
one
of
them
laying
around
the
house.
the
one
to
john.
the
wife
found
that.
she
said,
i
think
he
had
something
going
on
with
john,
let's
give
john
notice.
but
what
about
mary?
neither
mary
nor
john
happened
to
find
out
about
mr.
pope's
death
and
thus
much
less
know
about
a
probate.
it's
not
fair,
we
urge
the
court,
that
mary
should
be
left
out
even
though
she
had
the
same
legal
position
as
john.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
she
had
prior
experience
with
this
hospital.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
this
goes
outside
the
record
again,
but
to
answer
your
question,
a
personal
representative,
the
wife
of
the
deceased,
had
prior
experiences
with
this
hospital
and
with
this
husband
and
with
this
insurance
carrier
in
which
she
never
had
to
pay
a
dime.
she
assumed
and
had
reason
to
believe
that
she
wouldn't
have
to
pay
any
this
time
and,
therefore,
did
not
recognize
them
as
a
creditor
of
this
estate.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
the--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--no,
sir.
she
could
have
paid
it.
in
this
case,
she
didn't
believe...
once
she
was
presented,
which
was
more
than
over
a
year
after
her
husband's
death
was
the
first
notice
or
communication
that
she
received
from
the
hospital.
in
april,
approximately,
of
1980.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
there
was
in
her
mind.
she
still
believed
at
that
point
that
insurance
would
cover
because
insurance
had
been
making
payments
sporadically
over
a
period
of
months.
the
most
recent
one
having
been
around
february
of
1980,
about
two
months
prior
to
receiving
that
letter.
the
letter
she
received
did
not
indicate
any
past
due
amount
was
owed.
it
merely
stated
this
is
the
balance
of
the
account.
she
believed
that
insurance
would
cover
it
and
she
never
heard
again
from
either
the
hospital
or
their
collection
agency
until
approximately
1982.
up
to
this
point,
they
had
never
filed
anything
in
the
case
until
october
of
1983,
some
four
and
a
half
years
after
the
probate
had
been
initiated.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
yes,
justice
kennedy,
that
is
one
concern.
we
concede
that
a
twenty-two
cent
stamp
to
give
notice
is
not
a
problem,
but
there
could
possibly
be
a
problem
with
responsibility
upon
the
fiduciary
to
perform
under
their
bond
and
to
give
notice
because
under
the
earlier
example
of
john
and
mary,
mary
comes
in
and
says
my
due
process
rights
were
violated,
i
didn't
get
notice.
i'm
going
to
sue
you
and
she
may
have
a
claim
against
not
only
the
executor
but
the
heirs
later
down
the
road.
another--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--i
would
ask,
does
the
debtor
have
knowledge
of
the
identity
of
the
creditors
in
that
case,
and
if
so,--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--excuse
me.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
yes.
if
they
have
knowledge,
that's
one
thing,
and
in
order
to
declare
a
declaratory
judgment,
i
believe
that
this
court's
decisions
would
find
grounds
to
declare
that
unconstitutional.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
because
in
this
case,
there
was
no
declaratory
judgment
nor
are
there
in
probate
matters.
it's
simply
the
running
of
the
statute
which
is
similar
to
the
case
of
texaco,
inc.,
v.
short,
decided
by
this
case,
in
which
it
determined
that
the
running
of
a
statute
of
limitations
acts
to
cut
those
potential
claims
off
as
opposed
to
a
declaratory
judgment
in
mullane
and
mennonite.
that
is
one
of
the
distinctions
that
we
draw.
the
appellant
hospital
in
this
case
attempted
six
years
after
the
probate
was
started
to
draw
the
facts
of
this
case
to
fit
under
the
third
moseley
case
that
came
out
of
the
supreme
court
of
nevada.
the
facts
do
not
apply
at
all.
in
that
third
moseley
case,
the
personal
representative
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
creditors'
claims.
the
creditor
had
a
pending
lawsuit
against
the
deceased
at
the
time
of
death.
the
creditor
in
moseley
did
not
know
xx
the
death
of
the
decedent
until
the
final
day
for
filing
claims
and
they
filed
two
days
late.
that
wasn't
deemed
to
be
fair
and
i
don't
believe
that
it
was
fair,
but
it's
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
that's
why
it's
important
to
understand
some
of
the
facts
as
they
have
been
stated
in
the
briefs
that
are
not
in
the
record
and
which
distinguish
the
case
on
that
basis.
i
think
there's
also--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--i
think
part
of
the
answer
goes
to
the
nature
of
a
bankruptcy
versus
the
nature
of
a
probate
action.
the
whole
nature
of
the
case
in
new
york
that
you're
referring
to
has
to
do
with
getting
the
bankrupt
debtor
a
fresh
start
in
that
case,
a
reorganization
under
another
company.
that
debtor
in
the
new
york
case
knew
of
new
york
city's
existing
interest
in
the
real
property.
not
only
that,
but
in
that
particular
case,
the
judge,
according
to
the
findings,
failed
to
properly
follow
the
statute
in
requiring
all
creditors
to
be
given
mailed
notice.
another
distinction
is
that
the
notice
that
was
given
to
the
creditors
in
that
new
york
bankruptcy
case
had
to
do
of
a
court
order.
it
was
not
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
it
was
the
court
order
that
they
were
supposed
to
have
given
notice
to
new
york
city
about
that
they
failed
to
do.
so,
i
think
from
that
standpoint,
there
are
several
distinguishing
factors
between
a
bankruptcy
in
which
all
creditors
were
known
or
the
debtor
wouldn't
be
in
the
bankruptcy
court
to
begin
with
because
he
knows
who's
putting
the
pressure
on
him
from
the
credit
standpoint.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
there
is
not
currently
a
requirement.
it
is
frequent
in
orders
allowing
final
accounts
that
all
creditors
who
have
filed
claims
have
been
paid.
maybe
that
was
your
question.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
right.
we
maintain
that
the
hospital
appellant
had
several
opportunities
in
which
to
protect
itself
under
the
broad
scope
of
due
process
and
no
one
can
define
what
due
process
is
in
any
single
word
or
two,
but
we
suggest
that
it
represents
a
fair
or
reasonable
opportunity.
sometimes,
such
as
in
mullane
and
mennonite,
this
fair
or
reasonable
opportunity
requires
a
hearing
before
the
state
cuts
off
a
creditor's
interest.
but
sometimes
it
does
not
require
a
hearing,
such
as
in
the
texaco
case,
and
we
believe
that
ample
opportunity
is
made
under
the
oklahoma
non-claims
statute
for
debtors
or,
excuse
me,
for
creditors
to
present
their
claims
and
have
them
adjudicated.
if
a
creditor
is
going
to
do
business
in
a
state
and
loan
money
to
people
and
perform
services
for
people,
they
better
become
aware
of
the
law.
that
relates
not
only
to
probate
law,
they
better
be
aware
of
the
tax
laws.
in
a
hospital
case,
they
better
be
aware
of
negligence
law,
and
in
texaco,
this
court
held
that
presumption
of
the
statutes
is
made
by
the
court
when
a
statute
of
limitations
is
at
question.
we
determine
that
no
less
is
true
here.
we
believe
that--
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
--that's
correct.
mr.
phillip
k.
smith
people
who
do
business.
maybe
i
should
have
said
that.
people
who
do
business,
and
if
aunt
sue
loans
money
to
a
nephew
and
aunt
sue
has
been
a
homemaker
for
thirty
years
and
she
doesn't
normally
transact
business,
she
better
know
certain
things
about
usury
laws
or
perhaps
she's
violating
those.
so,
there
is
a
duty
on
any
person
who
transacts
certain
types
of
business
to
be
aware
of
the
law
or
to
find
out
about
the
law.
the
hospital
in
this
case
handled
business
and
has
people
die
in
its
wards
every
day.
they
know
what
the
law
is.
they
failed
to
do
their
job
by
not
filing
a
creditor's
claim
and
finding
out
about
the
probate.
we
pray
the
court
to
affirm
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
in
favor
of
the
estate
and
not
allow
facts
outside
the
record
to
be
twisted
into
the
confines
of
the
moseley
case,
the
texaco
case,
and
the
mullane
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
