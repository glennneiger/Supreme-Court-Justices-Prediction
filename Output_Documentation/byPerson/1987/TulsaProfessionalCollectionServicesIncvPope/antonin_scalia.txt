justice
scalia
and
the
later
it
goes,
the
less
time
you
have
to
file.
as
i
recall,
if
it's
five
years
after
the
death,
you
only
get
one
month
after
the
notice
is
published
instead
of
two.
justice
scalia
so,
you
theoretically
have
to
keep
reading
the
newspapers
for--
justice
scalia
you
don't
acknowledge
you
have
actual
notice.
are
you
acknowledging
that
you
had
actual
notice?
justice
scalia
of
the
death.
justice
scalia
the
death
doesn't
start
anything
running
at
all.
justice
scalia
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
the
creditor
of
a
contract
claim.
he
has
actual
notice
that
his
claim
exists,
but
that's
of
no
use
until
he
knows
that
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
has
started.
justice
scalia
you
urge
us
that
we
should
look
upon
them
in
two
different
ways.
so,
if
our
next
case
is
what,
a
one-year
time
period,
we...
you'd
lose,
but
this
is
a
sixty-day
and
you...
what's--
justice
scalia
--there
sure
is.
i
mean,
pick
a
number.
justice
scalia
mr.
rose,
what
is
it
that
cuts
off
your
claim?
is
it...
suppose
a
probate
proceeding
is
commenced
but
for
some
reason
terminated,--
justice
scalia
--and
then
a
new
probate
proceeding
is
commenced,
is
your
claim
dead?
justice
scalia
what
is
the
notice
is
published,
but
the
probate
for
some
reason
does
not
go
through
to
completion?
is
there
any
way
that
that
can
happen?
justice
scalia
you
would
have
to
because
actually
all
the
oklahoma
law
provides
for
the
out
of
state
creditors
the
longer
period.
he
still
can
be
barred
once
the
decree
is
entered.
justice
scalia
once
the
decree
is
entered,
he's
out,
whether
he
gives
notice
or
not.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
the
uncertainty
of
knowing
who...
you
say
unscrupulous
administrator
or
executor
might
not
notify
known
creditors.
is
it
clear
where
scrupulousness
lies?
i
mean,
i
assume
the
obligation
of
the
executor
is
to
maximize
the
estate
that
can
be
passed
on
to
the
heirs.
justice
scalia
well,
but
a
debt's
not
valid
if
it's
not
presented
in
time.
it's
barred.
justice
scalia
he
has
an
obligation
to
make
sure
that
everybody
doesn't
file
in
time
and
files
in
time.
i'm
not
sure
where
his
obligation
lies.
if
i
were
in
that
position
and
i
knew
that
my
obligation
under
law
is
just
to
publish
notice,
that
i've
opened
up
this
estate,
you
sure
that
i
have
an
obligation
to
these
creditors
that
i
know
of
rather
than
to
the
potential
distributees?
i'm
not
sure
where
that
lies.
justice
scalia
is
the
obligation
to
pay
debts
valid
when
all
the
debts
are
in
and
if
these
are
never
presented,--
justice
scalia
--they're
not
valid
debts?
justice
scalia
what's
the
big
deal
about
notifying
known
creditors?
why
does
that
have
to
delay
the
closing
of
the
estate?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
for
purposes
of
our
decision
in
reviewing
the
court
below,
they
assumed
for
purposes
of
decision
that
she
may
well
have
known
them
and
still
didn't
have
to
give
them
notice.
don't
we
have
to
decide
whether
there's
any
obligation
even
when
the
representative
of
the
estate
does
know?
i
mean,
you
may
be
right
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
she
didn't
know,
but
that
hasn't
been
tried
out,
has
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
smith,
suppose
oklahoma
wants
to
provide
an
easy
way
for
its
citizens
to
get
credit,
to
re-establish
their
credit,
so
it
provides
for
a
declaratory
judgment
scheme
in
which
you
can
file
a
declaratory
judgment
action
seeking
to
have
a
pronouncement
that
there
are
no
outstanding
debts
against
you
or
exactly
what
claims
there
are
against
you,
and
it
adopts
the
same
system
we
have
here,
you
simply
have
public
notice
of
the
suit
by
publishing
it
in
a
newspaper
and
any
creditor
who
doesn't
come
in
within
sixty
days,
asserting
a
claim,
shall
be
barred,
and
you'll
get
a
declaratory
judgment
that
that
debt
is
no
longer
relevant,
do
you
think
that
would
be
constitutional?
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
does
the
debtor
have
knowledge?
yes.
justice
scalia
now,
why
is
this
different?
why
couldn't
i
call
that
a
statute
of
limitations
just
as
well
as
you
want
us
to
call
this
one
a
statute
of
limitations?
