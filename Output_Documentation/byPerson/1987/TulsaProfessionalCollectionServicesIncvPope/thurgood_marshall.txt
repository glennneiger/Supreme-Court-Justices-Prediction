it
just
occurred
to
me,
there's
only
one
probate
court
in
tulsa,
isn't
there?
justice
marshall
so,
it's
only
one
court
you
have
to
watch?
justice
marshall
well,
once
every
sixty
days.
justice
marshall
--you're
a
professional
organization.
that's
your
job,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
this
isn't
an
inordinate...
i
mean,
if
it's
too
much
for
you
to
send
somebody
by
there
once
a
week?
justice
marshall
do
you
check
the
legal
papers?
justice
marshall
what
else
do
you
do
other
than
bill
people?
justice
marshall
and
all
of
them
paying
fees.
justice
marshall
and
all
of
them
paying
fees.
f-e-e-s.
justice
marshall
for
the
services
that
your
company
gives.
justice
marshall
you
get
paid
for
it.
justice
marshall
so,
the
more
you
have,
the
more
you
have
to
look
out
for.
justice
marshall
do
you
think
that
oklahoma
should
direct
their
laws
particularly
to
cooperate
with
you,
to
your
company?
justice
marshall
or
the
public
in
general.
justice
marshall
or
in
the
public
in
general.
justice
marshall
not
just
at
you
because
you
have
to
go
to
every
county--
justice
marshall
--and
every
state.
justice
marshall
well,
oklahoma
should
look
out
for
you
then
specially.
justice
marshall
well,
i
mean,
a
single
creditor
wouldn't
have
all
that
trouble,
would
he?
you
are
focusing
on
the
collection
agency.
i'd
like
to
focus
on
the
real
creditor,
the
hospital.
