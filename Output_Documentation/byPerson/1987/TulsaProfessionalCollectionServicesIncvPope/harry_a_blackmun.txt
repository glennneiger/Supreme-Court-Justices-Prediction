mr.
rose,
incidentally,
did
the
decedent
die
in
the
hospital?
justice
blackmun
why
weren't
they
then
on
some
kind
of
notice
that
there
was
an
estate
probably
to
be
probated?
justice
blackmun
they
certainly
knew
her
address.
justice
blackmun
was
this
a
tulsa
hospital?
justice
blackmun
it
is
certainly
a
less
sympathetic
case
than
if
your
creditor
were
off
in
new
york
or
somewhere.
justice
blackmun
well,
certainly,
i've
known
of
hospitals
that
routinely
watch
the
legal
notices
in
legal
newspapers--
justice
blackmun
--or
they
go
down
and
check
the
probate
office
and
get
their
claim
in.
justice
blackmun
your
hospital
just
sat
by
and
let
it
go,
even
though
the
death
was
in
tulsa
and
even
though
the
decedent
was
a
tulsa
resident.
justice
blackmun
well,
isn't
it
so?
justice
blackmun
well,
that
is
a
peculiar
oklahoma
quirk,
i
suppose,
but
how
does
it
really
affect
your
case?
justice
blackmun
and
when
was
the
assignment
made?
justice
blackmun
when
you
say
that
then,
the
real
creditor
is
still
the
hospital.
justice
blackmun
and
i
can't
get
much
sympathy
for
your
argument
about
every
county
and
every
state
when
you
have
a
tulsa
decedent
and
a
tulsa
hospital
and
the
tulsa
probate.
well,
in
oklahoma,
let
me
ask
this,
in
oklahoma,
where
is
the
probate
instituted?
in
the
county
of
residence?
justice
blackmun
but
in...
this
decedent
was
a
resident
of
this
particular
county.
justice
blackmun
i
can't
see
the
great
burden
that
is
on
your
client,
either
the
hospital
or
the
collection
agency.
i
just
can't
get
very
sympathetic
about
it.
justice
blackmun
isn't
that
what
this
case
is
about?
one?
justice
blackmun
would
you
be
satisfied
with
four
months?
justice
blackmun
many
other
states
have
four
months.
as
an
old
probate
hand,
i
know
that.
justice
blackmun
if
the
case
goes
back,
it
can
be
determined?
justice
blackmun
right.
what
was
the
reason,
if
any,
that
notice
was
not
given
to
the
hospital?
justice
blackmun
well,
the
hospital
bill
was
outstanding,
wasn't
it?
justice
blackmun
well,
were
you
counsel
for
the
estate
and
for
her?
justice
blackmun
well,
did
the
firm
share
her
belief?
justice
blackmun
but
you
can
answer
my
question.
why
didn't
the
firm
give
the
hospital
notice?
justice
blackmun
was
it
because
they
hoped
they
would
avoid
the
filing
of
a
claim
and
the
necessity
of
paying
it?
justice
blackmun
are
we
playing
games
in
oklahoma?
justice
blackmun
did
you
have
any
trouble
with
the
irs
who
would...
i've
known
them
in
the
past
to
insist
on
the
formal
filing
and
allowance
of
claims
before
they
allow
them
as
deductions.
did
you
have
any
trouble?
justice
blackmun
well,
in
response
to
that,
i
know
of
at
least
four
jurisdictions
where
that
is
not
true.
justice
blackmun
you
made
the
statement
you
thought
it
was
generally
the
practice,
and
i
questioned
that
one.
justice
blackmun
i
come
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
her
husband
was
in
the
hospital
for
several
weeks.
surely
she
knew
a
hospital
bill
was
accumulating.
i
would
be
surprised
if
she
didn't
know
whether
or
not
it
was
paid.
justice
blackmun
if
the
executor
were
the
first
national
bank
of
tulsa,
if
you
have
one,
they
certainly
would
have
investigated
it.
