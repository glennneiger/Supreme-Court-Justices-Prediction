mr.
randall
e.
rose
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
nature
of
the
case
to
be
presented
in
this
argument
involves
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
certain
oklahoma
statutes
providing
for
notice
by
publication
to
creditors
in
a
probate
proceeding.
section
331
of
title
58
of
the
oklahoma
statutes
sets
forth
that
notice
provision.
the
sole
notice
provided
is
a
notice
by
publication.
the
appellant,
here
and
after
referred
to
as
tpcs,
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
for
failing
to
provide
a
meaningful
notice
to
creditors
in
the
context
of
a
probate
proceeding
that
would
afford
due
process
as
required
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
upon
review
of
the
facts
in
this
case
and
an
application
of
the
oklahoma
statutory
scheme,
it
will
be
clear
that
current
oklahoma
law
does
not
provide
a
meaningful
notice.
it
is
our
position
that
an
analysis
of
the
relevant
decisions
of
this
court
will
require
due
process
to
be
extended
to
known
or
reasonably
ascertainable
creditors.
it
is
further
our
position
that
contrary
to
assertions
in
various
state
supreme
court
decisions,
that
(1)
a
creditor's
interest
in
a
probate
proceeding
is
a
property
right,
(2)--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
well,
that--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--yes,
that's
true,
your
honor.
that
actually
is
the
entire
crux
of
this
case.
it
is
undisputed
and
the
statement
of
facts
will
have
shown
that
the
decedent
died
in
the
hospital,
and
we
had
notice
obviously
that
he
died.
the
question
is
not
whether
we
had
notice
that
he
died,
but
whether
we
had
notice
of
the
initiation
of
the
probate
proceeding
and
the
publication
of
the
notice
to
creditors
to
file
their
claims.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
yes,
it
was.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
it
is
not
the
ideal
case
to
present
the
issue.
however,
again,
the
question
is
not
whether
we
had
notice.
no
one
has
denied,
it
has
been
readily
admitted,
it's
a
stipulated
fact
that
we
had
notice
that
he
died.
in
oklahoma,
a
probate
case
can
be
filed,
title
58,
section
22
of
the
oklahoma
statutes
provides
that
a
probate
case
can
be
filed
at
any
time
after
the
death
of
the
decedent.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
correct.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
correct.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
yes.
it
would
appear
that
way
on
the
surface.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
it
is
not
so.
if
i
may
respectfully
disagree
with
you.
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
an
additional
statutory
procedure
available,
originally
enacted
in
1910,
that
states
that
the
representative
of
the
estate
must
pay
the
expenses
of
last
illness
and
funeral
expenses
as
soon
as
practicable
after
the
funds
come
into
his
hands.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
in
that
situation,
it
is
not...
it
has
historically
been
the
case
that
you
do
not
have
to
file
a
creditor's
claim
to
collect
a
bill--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
again,
i
think
that
the
difficulty
is
in
this
case,
just
as
in
this
court's
decision
in
mennonite
board
of
missions
v.
adams
in
1983,
and
although
that
was
a
closely-divided
decision
in
that
case,
the
court
determined
that
the
notice
of
the
delinquency
of
taxes
was
not
the
same
thing
as
the
notice
that
the
property
was
going
to
be
sold.
in
oklahoma,
in
the
mennonite
case,
for
example,
there
is
a
time
period,
there
was
a
time
period
within
which
that
tax
sale
would
take
place.
in
oklahoma,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
statutes
that
we
have
to
work
with
and
as
provided
in
section
22
of
title
58,
that
notice
period,
the
time
within
which
to
present
your
claim,
can
begin
to
run
any
time
from
the
date
of
death
of
the
decedent
until
forever.
now,
there
is
some
statutory
construction
of
this
particular
statute.
there
are
specific
cases
that
say
three
years
and
five
years
and
fifteen
years
and
twenty-six
years.
so,
in
certain
specific
cases,
it
has
been
as
much
as
twenty-six
years
before
the
probate
case
was
filed.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
correct.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that
is
the
difficulty
with
the
whole
case.
you
have
to
keep
track
of
every
debtor
in
every
legal
publication,
every
newspaper
that's
defined
as
a
legal
publication
in
oklahoma,
in
every
county
in
oklahoma,
and
you
have
to
read
every
notice
that's
published,
every
day,
in
order
to
keep
track
of
a
specific
debtor.
and,
again,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
statutory
scheme
in
oklahoma,
you
have
to
do
that
for
five
or
ten
or
fifteen
or
twenty
years.
i
think
the
interesting
thing
about
section
22
is
that
it
says
that
the
general
statute
of
limitations,
the
longest
one
that
is
available
in
oklahoma
of
five
years,
that
general
set
of
statutes
of
limitations
from
one
to
five
years
for
different
causes
of
action,
that
statute
of
limitations
does
not
apply.
so,
it's
open.
the
probate
case
can
be
filed
at
any
time
after
the
death.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
you
can
file
a
claim,
but
the
difficulty
is
in
discovering
that
a
probate
case
is
filed.
so,
it's
the
same
situation.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
pardon
me?
mr.
randall
e.
rose
to
determine
whether
the
probate
case
is
filed?
well,
the
only
method
of
doing...
well,
you
can
call
the
courthouse
every
day.
you
can
call
the
court
clerk's
office
every
day
and
ask
them
if
a
probate
case
had
been
filed
in
the
name
of
that
decedent.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
well,
again,
in
the
context
of
this
case
and
the
way
it
arose,
the
fact
that
this
section
594
title
58
had
been
relied
on
historically
for
the
proposition
that
all
funeral
expenses
and
expenses
of
last
illness
are
supposed
to
be
paid,
no
mention
of
a
claim,
that
is
something
that
the
hospital
had
done.
i
think
the
important
thing
is,
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
thing
that
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
looked
at,
why
did
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
take
this
case.
why
did
they
decide
this
issue.
they
could
have
said,
well,
wait
a
minute,
they
had
actual
notice,
so
we're
not
going
to
decide
the
issue.
what
they
did
say,
though,
on
page
7-a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
they
said
that,
well,
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying
that
the
appellee
didn't...
that
the
appellant
didn't
show
that
they
didn't
have
actual
notice.
they
said
that's
not
the
burden
of
the
appellant.
the
appellee's
burden
is
to
show
that
the
proper
notice
was
given.
all
the
appellee
can
say
is
we
published
and
that's
what's
required
by
statute.
so,
we've
done
everything
that
we
could.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
of
what?
we
had
actual
notice
of
the
death.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
because
the--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--that's
right.
it
starts
nothing.
nothing
happens
when
the
person
dies
necessarily.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
true,
and
i
think
that
you
may
be
making
reference
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
1953
new
york
v.
new
york-new
haven
railroad
company,
where
this
court
decided
that
mailed
notice
was
required
to
creditors
of
that
debtor.
that
was
a
railroad
reorganization
case,
but
it
was
not
any
different.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
i
believe
so.
if...
in
that
case,
it's...
the
factual
situation
is
extremely
similar
to
the
factual
situation
in
this
case,
and
even
still,
in
that
case,
and
as
a
result
of
the
extension
of
the
holding
of
that
case
under
current
bankruptcy
law,
current
bankruptcy
rules
provide
that
a
notice
to
creditors
must
be
sent
out
within
some
statutory
time
period,
sixty
days
or
something
from
the
time
of
filing.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
correct.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
correct.
but,
again,
justice
marshall,
you
then
have
to
call
that
courthouse
every
day
for...
no.
that's
true.
you
just
have
to
continue
to
monitor...
pardon
me?
no,
not
in
this
case,
because
in
this
case,
when
the
notice
to
creditors
is
published,
you
only
have
sixty
days
to
file
a
claim.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
you
could
do
that
and
you
could
do
that
for
up
to
apparently
at
least
twenty-six
years
throughout...
for
every
debtor
that
you
had
in
every
county
in
oklahoma,
and
in
every
county
and
every
state
that
also
has
a
short-term
non-claim
statute,
such
as
we
have
in
oklahoma.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
in
this
particular
case,
that's
correct.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
the
importance,
though,
is
that
we
did
not
have
notice
of
the
initiation
of
the
probate
proceeding
and
the
subsequent
publication
of
notice
to
creditors.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
we
could
have
had.
i
think
that's
an
important
point.
had
we
had
notice,
if
we
had
known,
not
that
the
decedent
died,
but
if
we
had
known
that
the
probate
case
was
filed
and
the
notice
to
creditors
was
published,--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--then
we
would
have
filed
a
claim.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
well,
again,
in
this
case,
this
was
under
a
different
statutory
scheme,
that
all
i
can
tell
you
has
been...
was
relied
on
since
1910
when
the
statute
was
enacted
at
the
same
time.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
well,
again,--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--i
think
that
the
focus
should
be--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--that's
it.
we
try
to
collect
the
money.
i
think
that
the
focus
should
be
on
not
just
keeping
track
of
a
single
creditor...
of
a
single
debtor,
certainly
keeping
track
of
a
single
debtor,
when
you
isolate
on
that
one
single
creditor...
that
single
debtor,
it
is
easy
to...
you
can
say...
you
can
always
say
you
could
have
looked
out
for
that
single
debtor...
yes,
but
the
difficulty
is
in
doing
that,
in
every
county
reading
every
legal
publication
in
every
county,
in
not
only
oklahoma
but
in
all
the
states
that
have
a
sixty-day,
ninety-day
time
frame
within
which
to
file
a
claim.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that
is
precisely
my
point,
and
that
is--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--pardon
me?
mr.
randall
e.
rose
for?
mr.
randall
e.
rose
correct.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
correct.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
okay.
i
agree.
the
focus
on
the
case,
though,
should
be
on...
it's
not
conceded--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--to
cooperate
with
all
creditors
that
are
similarly
situated.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
pardon
me?
mr.
randall
e.
rose
well,
it's
for
everyone.
it's
for
everyone
to
whom--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
no,
not
specially,
but
in
conjunction
with
all
other
creditors.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
on
the
hospital.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
the
assignment
from
the
hospital
to
the
collection
agency?
the
entities
are
related
entities,
as
is
reflected
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
it
is
another
office
within
the
hospital.
they
are
separate
corporations.
they
operate
separately.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
correct.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
it's
in
the
county
of
residence.
it
can
be
in
the
county
where
the
property
is
located.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
correct.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
again,
when
you
focus
on
one--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--it
certainly
is.
we
can't
represent...
we're
not
representing
the
interests
of
every
specific
debtor,
every
specific
creditor
that
there
is.
in
a
general
way,
we're
doing
that.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
no,
they
have
not.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
no,
no.
the
stipulated
facts,
the
only
facts--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--that's
correct.
those
are
the
only--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--no
other
findings.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
in
this
case,
without
the
filing
of
a
claim,
yes.
yes.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
yes.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
well,
the
reference
i
made
to
mennonite
was
that
the
notice
of
the
delinquency
of
taxes
was
not
the
same
thing
as
the
notice
of
the
pendency
of
a
sale.
it's
the
same
situation
here.
the
notice
of
the
death
is
not
the
same
thing
as
the
notice
of
the
pendency
of
the
probate
proceeding
or
the
subsequent--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--pardon
me?
mr.
randall
e.
rose
certainly,
certainly.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
right.
the
arguments
that
have
been
used
to
defeat
a
claim
of
unconstitutionality
of
a
particular
statute
have
included
that
there
is
no
adjudication
of
property
rights.
for
example,
in
that
specific
case,
the
state
has
suggested
that
notice
by
mailing
is
only
required,
may
only
be
required
when
tangible
property
interests
are
involved.
however,
in
the
mennonite
case,
there
were
cases
cited
that
set
forth
interests
that
were
not
tangible
property
interests,
and
those
included
the
student's
right
to
a
public
education,
the
right
to
continue
utility
service
during
the
time
that
a
disputed
bill
remained
unpaid.
the
new
york
case
example
of
a
debt
owed
to
a
creditor
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
as
well
as
the
mullane
example
of
a
trustee's
obligation
to
provide
an
accounting.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
true.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
true.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
true.
but
it's
an
intangible
property
interest
just
as
a
student's
right
to
a
public
education
is
an
intangible
property
right.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
yes,
it
has.
but
the
law
also
does
not
distinguish
the
application
of
the
principles
of
due
process
based
on
a
classification
of
property.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
true.
well,
another
argument
that
has
been
used
to
defeat
the
claim
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
a
particular
statute
is
that
a
non-claim
statute
is
a
statute
of
limitations,
so
that
notice
by
publication
would
be
sufficient.
a
non-claim
statute,
though,
is
not
the
same
either
by
definition
or
by
its
application
as
a
long-term
statute
of
limitations
is
the
traditional
statute
of
limitations.
in
a
traditional
statute
of
limitations,
there
is
the
concept
of
repose
for
the
claim
and
the
concept
that
stale
claims
will
be
precluded
by
the
running
of
the
statutory
period.
in
the
short-term
statute
that
some
courts
have
referred
to
as
a
statute
of
limitations,
there
is
not
that
same
possibility.
the
idea
of
the
claim
resting,
repose
for
the
claim,
doesn't
exist
in
just
a
sixty-day
time
period,
and
the
claim
is
not
going
to
become
stale
in
that
time
period.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
correct.
in
those
states
with
longer-term
statutes,
the
same
kinds
of
policy
considerations
or
policy
considerations
of
those
states
and
yet,
they
have
a
true
statute
of
limitations
that
is
one
to
two
up
to
six
years.
in
this
non-claim
statute,
there
is
not
that
same
consideration.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
there's
a
difficulty.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
you
have
to
draw
a
line.
you
have
to
draw
a
line
somewhere.
the
question
is
in
applying
the
statute,
in
applying
the
concept
of
due
process,
is
the
means
that
you
use...
is
it
going
to
accomplish
the
purpose
that
you
intend
for
it
to
to
accomplish.
in
the
short-term
non-claims
statute,
or
in
a
longer-term
non-claim
statute,
that
idea
is
met.
in
the
shorter-term
non-claims
statute,
it
is
just
simply
not
met.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
yes.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
no.
the
claim...
you
have
sixty
days
after
the
notice
by
publication
is
published
to
file
your
claim.
so
that
if
the
notice
was
not
published,
that
is
if
the
probate
case
is
just
filed
and
dismissed,
then
you
would
not
have
lost
your
claim.
the
time
period
doesn't
begin
to
run
until
the
notice
is
published.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
well,
i
suppose...
i
don't
know
the
answer
off
the
top
of
my
head.
i
would
suppose
that
perhaps
it
could
not
have.
if
the
probate
case
is
filed,
i
mean,
what
is
the
reason?
you
know,
it's
speculative.
what's
the
reason
for
the
case
being
dismissed?
if
it's
because
someone
dies,
they
can
appoint
someone
else.
if
it's
because
the
decedent
didn't
really
die,
of
course,
then
that's
a
different
situation,
but
it
would
depend
on...
let's
just
take
some
speculation.
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
probably
it
wouldn't
be
dismissed
if
it
was
something
like
someone
dying.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
true.
i
think
the
court...
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
look
at
in
deciding
whether
due
process
is
afforded
in
this
case,
whether
it
should
be
afforded,
is
to
look
at
the
state
interest
involved,
and
this
is
a
balancing
test
that
the
dissent
theory
was
not
going
to
be
used
any
longer
in
the
mennonite
case.
just
a
balancing
test.
it's
weighing
the
interests
of
the
creditor
and
his
right
in
the
probate
proceeding
against
the
interest
of
the
state
in
applying
their
laws.
the
interest
of
the
state
in
oklahoma
apparently
is
strictly
and
nothing
else
order,
finality
of
proceedings
and
quick
settlement
of
estate,
and
i
say
this
because
in
1965,
the
statute
was
reduced,
the
time
period
in
which
to
file
claims
was
reduced
from
four
months
to
the
current
two-month
period.
if
the--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--no.
again,
that's
a
legislative
determination.
i
would
think
that
one
year
would
be
long
enough
for
all
claims
to
come
to
the
attention--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--yes.
some
states
have
four
months.
some
states
have
two,
two
states
have
two
months,
some
states
have
six,
and
some
states
have
a
year
or
two
years
up
to
six
years.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
stevens,
i
believe,
was
asking
a
question
about
how
quickly
can
that
time
period
pass
within
which
to
file
your
claims.
in
oklahoma,
the
representative
is
required
to
publish
the
notice
within
thirty
days
of
his
appointment.
the
wording
in
the
statute
is:
must
be
revoked,
but
then
follows
by:
unless
good
cause
is
shown.
the
practice
is
and
what
is
preferred
by
the
court
is
to
publish
a
notice
within
thirty
days
and
then
you
end
up
with
a
ninety-day
time
period.
i
believe
you
had
that
question.
justice
scalia,
i
believe,
was
asking
a
question
about
the
difficulty
in
the
unscrupulous
personal
representative
hiding
behind
the
log
to
use
the
appellee's
terminology.
they
paid
some
claims
and
they
didn't
pay
some
claims.
the
decedent
was
in
the
hospital
for
a
number
of
months,
had
a
$142,000
hospital
bill,
and
says
i
didn't
know
that
there
was
any
money
still
owing.
again,
a
lot
of
these
facts
are
outside
the
record,
and
it
makes
it
difficult
for
the
court
and--
mr.
randall
e.
rose
--well,
not
if...
that
would
be
fine.
i
believe
that
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied,
that
that
would
not
be
necessary.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
okay.
yes,
i
believe
that's
right.
mr.
randall
e.
rose
that's
correct.
i
believe
justice
scalia
also
asked
what's
the
problem
with
giving
notice
to
known
creditors.
there's
not
really
a
problem.
what
would
be
required
of
a
representative
in
that
kind
of
situation?
due
diligence.
this
is
making
up
the
law
now.
what
kind
of
requirements
should
we
have?
due
diligence,
reasonable
inquiry
on
the
part
of
the
personal
representative.
in
seeking
to
notify...
to
ascertain
and
notify
creditors,
on
his
appointment--
