justice
o'connor
mr.
rose,
has
any...
have
the
lower
courts
determined
precisely
what
it
is
the
hospital
had
actual
notice
of?
justice
o'connor
whether
the
hospital
did
have
actual
knowledge
of
a
probate
proceeding?
justice
o'connor
the
stipulated
facts
just
is
that
the
hospital
knew
of
the
death,
obviously.
justice
o'connor
but
no
other
finding,
is
there?
justice
o'connor
well,
if,
in
fact,
the
hospital
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
probate
proceeding,
do
you
lose?
justice
o'connor
you
concede
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
just
never
been
decided,
i
take
it.
justice
o'connor
who
knew
what
has
not
been
decided.
justice
o'connor
do
you
also
maintain
that
the
hospital
knew
of
the
probate
proceeding?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
there
wasn't
a
probate
proceeding
before
he
died.
justice
o'connor
mr.
smith,
what
if
we
had
here
a
creditor
from
out
of
state
with
no
knowledge
of
the
death
or
the
probate
proceeding,
do
you
think
that
publication
notice
under
the
oklahoma
statute
would
be...
would
meet
due
process
requirements?
justice
o'connor
well,
then,
let's
make
it
an
in
state
creditor
without
any
knowledge
at
all.
justice
o'connor
well,
that
isn't
my
question.
i'm
not
asking
about
the
operation
of
the
statute.
i'm
asking
you
whether
you
would
say
that
due
process
would
require
something
more
than
publication
notice
to
such
creditors.
justice
o'connor
there
certainly
is
a
financial
interest
in
the
heirs
at
least
in
avoiding
notice
to
creditors,
isn't
there?
i
mean,
certainly
the
potential
heir
will
enhance
the
estate
if
creditors
don't
know.
justice
o'connor
how
do
you
distinguish
the
city
of
new
york
case
holding
that
notice
by
publication
was
not
sufficient
for
creditors
in
filing
claims
in
a
bankruptcy
estate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
tulsa
professional
collection
services
versus
pope
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma.
it
involve
a
due
process
clause
challenge
to
apportion
of
the
oklahoma
probate
code
which
provides
for
publication
of
notice
in
the
newspaper
advising
creditors
that
they
must
file
their
claim
against
the
state
within
two
months
or
their
claims
will
be
barred.
no
other
form
of
notice
is
required.
the
question
presented
is
whether
this
provision
of
notice
solely
by
publication
satisfies
the
due
process
clause.
the
appellant
has
a
claim
against
the
state
for
unpaid
medical
expenses
but
failed
to
file
the
claim
within
the
2-month
period.
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
accordingly
held
that
the
appellant
could
not
recover
on
the
claim
rejecting
the
appellant's
argument
that
providing
only
publication
notice
violated
the
due
process
clause.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
we
reverse
and
remand
we
have
construed
the
due
process
clause
to
require
actual
notice
of
legal
proceedings
that
will
adversely
affect
the
property
interest
of
any
reasonably
acertainable
party.
here
the
appellant
has
an
unsecured
claim
that
the
probate
proceeding
will
completely
extinguished.
accordingly,
the
appellant's
identity
was
reasonably
acertainable.
we
hold
that
due
process
requires
that
the
appellant
receive
actual
notice.
because
the
record
does
not
reveal
whether
appellant's
identity
as
a
creditor
was
reasonably
acertainable,
we
remand
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
blackmun
concurs
in
the
result,
and
chief
justice
renquest
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
