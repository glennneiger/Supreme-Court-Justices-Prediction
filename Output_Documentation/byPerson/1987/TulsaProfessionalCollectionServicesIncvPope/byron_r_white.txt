justice
white
--can
you
file
a
claim
before
the
notice
goes
out?
justice
white
you
don't
think
that's
so
hard,
do
you?
justice
white
you
don't
really
think
that's
so
hard,
do
you?
justice
white
but
you
wouldn't
have
had
to
do
it
very
long
in
this
case?
justice
white
well,
that's
the
case
we're
judging.
not
some
other.
justice
white
well,
that's
true,
that's
true,
but
you
could
have
had.
justice
white
oh,
sure.
justice
white
sure
you
would
have,
but
you
could
have
easily
found
out.
it
wouldn't
have
taken
a
whole
lot
of
effort
to
find
out
in
this
case.
there
may
be
some
other
creditors,
you
wouldn't
expect
them
to
inquire,
but
a
collection
agency--
justice
white
if
you
know
about
them.
justice
white
if
you
know
about
them.
you
can't
give
notice
to
out
of
state
creditors
personally
unless
you
know
about
them.
justice
white
well,
those
claims
had
been
filed,
i
take
it.
justice
white
she
still
paid
them?
justice
white
but
you
knew
about
them
and
paid
them?
justice
white
and
you
didn't
give
the
hospital
notice
because
you
were
relying
on
the
public
notice?
justice
white
well,
she
would
have
had
to
pay
it.
justice
white
do
you
think
the
constitution
would
require
that
you
give
at
least
public
notice?
justice
white
why?
justice
white
yes,
but
the
question
justice
stevens
poses
is
whatever
kind
of
administrator
you
have,
if
the
administrator
actually
knows
of
a
creditor,
must
he
give
them
notice.
justice
white
well,
the
question
is,
does
the
constitution
require
more.
justice
white
well,
sooner
or
later,
it
became
evident
that
the
hospital
was
and
that
the
bill
was
unpaid.
justice
white
and
is
there
some
rule
in
oklahoma
that
an
administrator
can't
pay
a
valid
debt
after
the
claims
period
has
run?
justice
white
then,
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
bill
was
valid,
was
there?
