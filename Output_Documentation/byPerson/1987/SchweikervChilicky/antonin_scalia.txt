justice
scalia
what
the
respondents
are
saying,
general
fried,
is
that's
a
remedy,
but
a
remedy
for
a
different
wrong;
that
they're
not
complaining
here
about
the
denial
of
benefits.
those
sections
will
indeed
allow
us
to
remedy
the
denial
of
benefits.
but
what
they're
complaining
about
is
not
the
denial,
but
the
denial
of
due
process
that
led
to
the
denial,
and
that's
what
they
want
a
remedy
for.
justice
scalia
but
why
not
the
consequential
damages
along
with
those
benefits,
which
would
follow?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
sure
it
bears
on
a
question
of
what
the
damages
ought
to
be
either.
once
again,
the
obloquy,
if
that's
what
it
is,
is
the
same
whether
it
was
done
intentionally
or
not.
the
obloquy
would
be
the
same
if
some
alj
just
simply
decided
the
facts
wrong.
and
the
fellow
that's--
justice
scalia
--the
emotional
distress;
the
trauma;
is
the
same;
your
client
is
lying
in
this
hospital
bed;
he
gets
exactly
the
same
news;
and
you're
telling
us
that
in
the
one
case,
if
he
sues
on
a
bivens
theory,
he's
entitled
to
consequential
damages;
whereas
under
the
statute,
where
the
same
thing
happens
as
far
as
the
effect
on
him
is
concerned,
all
he's
entitled
to
is
to
get
the
benefits
that
were
denied.
that's
seems
to
be
a
strange
system.
justice
scalia
that's
what
we're
talking
about
damages.
we're
talking
about
damages;
not
whether
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
that's
why
the
prison
example
you
give
isn't
really
parallel.
yes,
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
or
not
may
well
depend
on
the
intent;
but
what
intelligent
damages
are;
what
we
as
courts
should
determine
are
intelligent
damages,
it
seems
to
me
is
no
different
in
the
case
where
it's
intentional
and
where
it's
not
intentional.
the
harm
suffered
by
the
individual
is
quite
the
same.
