general
fried,
you
may
begin
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
damages
are
they
seeking
here--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--they
did
get
benefits
retroactively?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
adhering
to
a
precedent
that
had
been
decided
some
fifty
years
before,
you
might
also
say.
and
rejecting
a
very
persuasive
dissent.

chief

william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
fried.
we'll
now
hear
from
you,
mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
fried...
at
some
point...
it
doesn't
have
to
have
been...
i'd
appreciate
your
describing
just
briefly
in
perhaps
more
detail
what
it
is
that
the
respondent
claimed
that
the
petitioners
did?
chief
justice
rehnquist
as
to
the
individual
benefit
denials...
if
a
particular
respondent
felt
that
he
had
been
"tossed
off"
because
deliberately
they
were
paying
no
attention,
he
could
have
challenged
that
in
court,
could
he
not,
under
the
social
security
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
true
of
any
option--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--if
you
don't
take
advantage
of
it,
it
doesn't
do
you
any
good.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
mean
injunctive
relief.
couldn't
you
have
gone
into
court
and
say
that,
"my
benefits
were
denied
in
the
administrative
process
for
the
precise
same
reason
you
say
now
because
there
was
an
unconstitutional
scheme
afoot,
they
weren't
listening
to
evidence.
"
a
district
court
could
have
reversed
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
any
time
someone
is
denied
workmens'
compensation
benefits;
disability
benefits;
because
the
agency
says,
"well,
your
claim
of
disability
really
hasn't
been
proven,
that's
stigmatizing?
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
to
say
it's
deliberately
inflicted
would
be
right;
but
to
say
it's
a
stigma
is
something
else,
i
think,
because
i
thought
our
cases
used
the
word,
"stigma"
in
the
sense
of
something
that
is
generally
recognized
perhaps
as
a
badge
of
obloquy
or
something
like
that.
and
i
just
don't
think
that
a
determination
that
you're
no
longer
disabled
carries
that
connotation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
may
be
quite
true,
but
then
you
import
the
term,
"stigma"
as
if
that
somehow
adds
to
the
fact
it's
been
a
deliberate
violation
of
the
constitution.
