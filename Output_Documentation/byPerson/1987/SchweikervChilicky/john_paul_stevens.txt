justice

general
fried,
is
their
claim
comparable
to
the
claim
the
court
sustained
in
first
english?
justice
stevens
i
understand
the
legal
theory
is
different,
but
they,
in
effect,
are
saying
it's
not
enough
to
give
us
our
property
back
after
all
the
litigation
is
over.
and
that's
what
the
court
said
with
respect
to
the
interference
with
the
use
of
property
in
that
context.
justice
stevens
i'm
not
sure
the
plain
language
is
quite
as
persuasive
as
you
make
it,
because
the
clause
says,
"no
property
shall
be
taken
without
just
compensation.
"
it
doesn't
say
there
shall
be
just
compensation;
they
went
ahead
and
took
it.
and
it
also
says,
"no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
property
without
due
process
of
law.
"
they're
both
phrased
in
the
negative.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
no.
justice
stevens
you
would
say
that
you
remedy
the
one
by
providing
the
"just
compensation"
that
was
not
provided;
and
you
remedy
the
other
by
providing
the
"due
process"
not
provided,
i
presume?
justice
stevens
mr.
tribe,
could
i
ask
you:
suppose
there
hadn't
been
any
constitutional
violation
and
simply
a
denial
of
benefits
wrongfully
under
the
statute,
in
all
good
faith,
but
it
was
wrongfully
denied.
now,
surely
the
people
who
were
subjected
to
that
non-constitutional
violation
could
have
the
same
kind
of
damages
that
you
ask
us
to
give
to
your
clients
for
here.
they
too,
could
have
been
deprived
of
their
residences;
evicted;
or
whatever
else.
they
could
have
had
all
those
consequential
damages;
but
congress
has
chosen
to
give,
as
relief,
only
the
amount
of
money
that
should
have
been
paid,
even
though
the
same
consequential
damages
would
have
been
fair.
now,
don't
you
think
that
that
may
be
some
indication
of
what
congress
wants
to
be
done
with
respect
to
any
bivens
claims
that
there
are?
justice
stevens
mr.
tribe,
of
course
there
you
have
the
same
complex
remedial
system
in
the
law
enforcement
area.
justice
stevens
but
let
me
ask
you
a
different
question:
justice
scalia
asked
you
about...
you
may
have
the
same
kind
of
damage
from
statutory
violations.
i
wonder
if
you
could
not
also
have
the
same
kind
of
damage
from
constitutional
violations;
arbitrary
quotas;
the
same
things
you
allege
here;
but
as
the
result
of
carelessness
and
poor
staffing
and
all
the
rest
rather
than
as
a
result
of
deliberateness?
my
question
is,
is
your
emphasis
of
deliberate
wrongdoing
because
you
think
that's
a
part
of
the
constitutional
violation,
or
you
think
as
a
matter
of
prudence,
the
remedy
should
be
so-limited?
justice
stevens
so
there
would
be
a
defense
in
this
case
if
the
secretary
put
on
evidence
that
he
got
bad
staff
advice;
he
thought
he
was
doing
something
reasonable;
so
that
would
be
a
complete
difference?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
an
immunity.
i'm
saying
there
would
be
an
absence
of
a
violation
rather
than
an
immunity.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
justice
stevens
have
you
computed
the
realistic
exposure
of
the
defendants
in
this
case,
assuming
you're
right?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
damages?
how
much
do
they
pray
for?
justice
stevens
and
how
many
members
of
the
class?
