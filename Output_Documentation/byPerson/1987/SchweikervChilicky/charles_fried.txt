mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
plaintiff
respondents
were
terminated
from
the
social
security
disability
roles
and
subsequently
their
disability
benefits
were
restored
either
through
the
appeals
process
or
by
new
application,
and
they
were
restored
retroactively
either
through
the
appeals
process
or
in
compliance
with
the
1984
reform
act.
separately,
they
brought
this
bivens
action
against
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services;
the
commission
of
social
security;
and
the
head
of
the
state
agency
charging
that
their
due
process
rights,
their
constitutional
rights,
had
been
violated
in
that
those
three
individuals
had
caused
them
to
be
subject
to
advertently
inaccurate
and
legally
unwarranted
determination
which
resulted
in
the
loss
of
their
benefits
in
the
first
instance.
our
contention
is
that
whether
or
not
there
was
a
due
process
violation
here,
and
whether
or
not
ultimately
the
three
individual
defendants
are
found
to
be
qualifiedly
immune,
this
cause
of
action
is
precluded
for
three
reasons:
it
is
precluded
by
the
statute
itself;
it
is
precluded
because
the
statute
occupies
the
field
and
is
a
comprehensive
scheme
so-occupying
the
field;
and
it
is
precluded
because
there
are
here
special
factors
counselling
hesitation.
taking
the
statutory
preclusion
first,
405(g)
provides
an
unusually
capacious
system
for
raising
any
kind
of
claim,
statutory
or
constitutional,
and
allows
a
wide
variety
of
relief:
class
action
relief;
injunctive
relief,
and
allows
constitutional
as
well
as
statutory
claims
to
be
read.
405(h)
says
that
this
scheme
is
to
be
the
exclusive
scheme
for
raising
issues
regarding
social
security
benefits,
and
the
third
sentence,
the
second
sentence...
one
might
say,
says
what
you
must
do...
which
is
to
have
recourse
to
405(g)
scheme;
and
the
third
sentence,
what
you
may
not
do.
what
you
may
not
do
is
try
an
end-run
around
the
405(g)
scheme
by
having
recourse
to
section
1331
general
federal
question
jurisdiction,
which
is
precisely
what
the
respondents
did
in
this
case.
the
second
reason
that
this
cause
of
action
is
precluded
is
that
there
is
here
an
unusually
comprehensive
and
complex
scheme,
which
over...
which
occupies
the
field.
and
it's
a
scheme
which
is
not
only
complex,
but
is
continuously
fine-tuned
by
congress,
so
that
congress
has,
as
it
were,
not
only
laterally,
but
over
time,
occupied
this
field,
so
that
it
quite
inappropriate
to
overlay
that
scheme
with
a
personal
action
for
damages
against
high
government
officials
out
of
their
own
pockets.
and
finally,
there
are
special
factors
counselling,
hesitation.
now,
these
three
bases
for
preclusion
are
each
of
them
in
our
view
quite
sufficient
to
dispose
of
the
claim.
but
in
fact
they
converge
and
work
together.
the
405(g)
and
(h)
scheme
precludes
a
bivens
action
here
because
the
scheme
is
so
comprehensive.
and
the
scheme
is
so
comprehensive
because
of
the
special
factors
which
counsel
hesitation.
congress
was
surely
aware
how
contentious
it
was
to
deal
with
and
to
take
away
or
to
deny
social
security
benefits,
and
the
numbers
of
cases
in
which
these
contentious
issues
would
arise.
so
these
three
reasons
are
separately,
but
they
work
together
jointly
as
well,
and
together
they
make
quite
clear
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
bivens
action
is
appropriate.
i
would
suggest
that
after
a
certain
amount
of
oscillation,
this
court
came
to
rest
in
bush
v.
lucas
on
the
proper
role
of
the
bivens
action.
there
were
two
extreme
poles
in
which
the
argument
proceeded.
one
pole
would
have
had...
and
no
member
of
this
court
i
believe
ever
took
up
a
position
there...
one
pole
would
have
said
that
there
must
be
constitutional
damages
where
there
is
a
constitutional
right,
and
that
damages
are
specified
by
the
constitution
itself.
that
would
make
every
constitutional
clause
carry
with
it
a
constitutional
damage
remedy
in
the
way
that
this
court
in
the
first
english
case
last
term,
said
that
the
'just
compensation
"clause
is
a
constitutionally-mandated
damage
remedy.
"
the
other
way,
the
opposite
pole,
was
taken
up
by
justice
black
in
his
dissent
in
bivens,
which
said,
'only
if
the
congress
has
specifically
authorized
the
court
to
grant
a
damage
remedy,
should
there
be
one.
where
bush
v.
lucas
came
to
rest
is
to
see
that
there
is
here
an
interpretive
partnership
between
the
court
and
congress,
a
partnership
which,
in
the
end,
should
leave
the
area
of
law
with
a
scheme
that
makes
sense.
but
it
is
a
partnership
in
which
congress
is
necessarily
the
senior
partner;
it
is
the
senior
partner
because
it's
been
recognized
that
congress
can
preclude
a
damage
remedy;
and
congress
can
act
in
such
a
way...
and
this
is
where
i
think
bush
contributed,
can
act
in
such
a
way
that
it
no
longer
makes
sense
to
imply
that
damage
remedy
which
otherwise
the
court
under
1331
would
have
the
power
to
do.
now,
this
case
seems
to
us
to
be
just
like
bush.
there
is
one
and
only
one
point
of
departure,
and
that
is
the
obvious
fact
that
persons
who
are
terminated
from
social
security
benefits
are
often
likely
to
suffer
greater
hardship
than
those
who
have
been
fired
from
federal
jobs.
mr.
charles
fried
there
have
been
many
of
them,
yes.
mr.
charles
fried
there
have
been
many
of
them.
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief
the
finding
from
the
senate
report
explaining
why
those
initial
determinations
are
likely
to
have
been
upset.
new
evidence
comes
in
at
later
stages;
the
alj
stage
is
the
first
stage
at
which
there
is
a
personal
confrontation
with
a
decisionmaker,
so
i
don't
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
lay
all
the
incorrect
decisions
at
the
door
of
callousness
or
malice.
the
hardship
is
greater,
but
it
is
a
kind
of
hardship
which
this
court
specifically
confronted
in
mathews
v.
eldridge,
and
there
held
that
post-termination
restoration
of
benefits
were
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
due
process.
working
in
the
opposite
direction,
this
case
seems
to
us
clearer
than
bush,
because
the
fine
tuning
which
congress
has
engaged
in,
is
a
fine
tuning
which
has
occurred
frequently.
congress
has
revisited
this
problem
time
and
time
again,
and
has
in
fact
addressed
many
of
the
complaints
which
are
raised
in
this
case.
and
most
importantly,
unlike
bush,
the
constitutional
violations,
if
they
occur,
occur
in
the
course
of
an
administrative,
adjudicative
process,
such
that
the
process
itself
carries
with
it
a
means
for
redress.
the
crucial
point
in
our
view
is
that
the
respondents
are
profoundly
wrong
in
saying
that
it
is
necessary
to
imply
a
bivens
remedy,
lest
the
respondents
here
are
left
voiceless
in
respect
to
their
constitutional
claims,
lest
their
constitutional
wrongs
remain
voiceless,
because
we
have
in
405(g)
a
remedy
which
this
court,
together
with
congress,
and
i
think
this
court
particularly,
has
made
particularly
receptive
to
all
kinds
of
claims,
and
most
recently
in
the
city
of
new
york
case.
in
the
city
of
new
york
case,
we
had
precisely
the
same
complaints
that
are
being
raised
here
in
this
case.
and
the
court
found
a
way
to
make
405(g)
perfectly
adequate
to
respond
to
those
claims.
so
those
claims,
whether
constitutional
or
statutory,
whether
factual
or
legal,
can
be
raised
and
can
be
raised
within
what
has
been
described
as
the
unusually
protective
scheme
of
405(g).
mr.
charles
fried
they
are,
of
course,
complaining
of
the
denial
of
benefits,
but
they
add
adverbs
to
that
complaint:
they
say
we
were
denied
benefits
and
we
were
done
so
illegally,
unconstitutionally.
they
complain
that
405(g)
gives
them
a
remedy
for
everything
but
the
adverbs.
now
it
seems--
mr.
charles
fried
--they
are
seeking
damages
for
emotional
distress
and
the
complaints
states
that
they
are
seeking
damages
for
loss
of
the
food,
medicine,
and
other
necessities
which
they
were
deprived
of.
now,
there
is
a
certain
puzzle
about
that,
because
there
is,
of
course,
they
received
the
financial
award
with
which
they
would
have
purchased
that.
mr.
charles
fried
they
did.
all
three
of
them.
chilicky
got
them,
not
as
a
result
of
the
administrative
process,
but
in
compliance
with
the
1940
and
1984
act,
but
all
three
have
received
retroactive
benefits,
so
that
the
complaint
must
be
for
what
we
must
describe
as
consequential
damages:
emotional
distress;
and
the
loss
that
comes
about
from
not
having
had
that
money
when
you
wanted
it;
and
where
obviously,
you
could
have
used
it;
and
perhaps
when
you
desperately
needed
it.
mr.
charles
fried
i
don't
believe
so,
because
the
first
english
case
dealt
with
a
fifth
amendment
taking
violation.
mr.
charles
fried
the
court
certainly
did.
but
the
reason
that
the
court
came
to
that
conclusion,
and
it
focused
its
conclusion
on
the
point
was
that
the
constitution
itself
in
so
many
words,
requires
"just
compensation".
so
the
damage
remedy
awarded
in
first
english
was
a
damage
remedy
which
was
itself
required
by
the
constitution.
and
that
is
how
the
court
in,
may
i
say,
rejecting
a
suggestion
of
the
solicitor-general,
decided
that
case.
mr.
charles
fried
it
was
an
exciting
case.
0
[mirth.]
but
it
was
a
case
which
dealt
with
a
very
special
set
of
circumstances;
a
constitutional
provision
which
carried
with
it
its
own
damage...
a
constitutional
remedy...
and
which
was
focused
quite
specifically
on
traditional
kinds
of
property,
which
this
court
has
several
times
held
social
security
benefits
are
not.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
fried
but
the
"due
process
of
law"
clause
does
not
say
"without
just
compensation".
mr.
charles
fried
and
that,
i
think,
is...
thereby
hangs
that
particular
tale,
i
would
suggest.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
that,
i
would
say
that
the
constitution
requires
no
more
than
that
you
provide
the
"due
process".
this
court
has
said--
mr.
charles
fried
--that
you
may
apply
more,
but
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
that
you
do
so.
and
yet,
respondents
argue
as
if
there
were
a
constitutional
requirement
that
you
do
so.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
you
supply
the
"due
process"
by
applying
due
process,
and
that
means
in
this
case,
you
give
that
which,
if
you
have
taken
away
that
which
the
law
says
you
should
not
take
away,
you
think
again
and
you
said,
"no,
we
were
wrong";
and
you
give
it
to
the
person.
now,
there
is
no
additional
requirement
that
you
also
pay
something
extra
for
having
gotten
it
wrong
the
first
time.
mr.
charles
fried
there
is
a
statutory
requirement
that
you
do
so.
mr.
charles
fried
the
fact
that
there
are
retroactive
benefits,
i
should
think,
would
help
mightily
in
determining
whether
what
405(g)
has
done
here
is
sufficient
to
displace
a
bivens
action.
i
don't
believe
that,
absent
bivens,
there
is
a
constitutional
requirement
that
you
give
retroactive
benefits.
after
all,
if
a
person
has
been
incorrectly
imprisoned
and
is
then
released
because
a
constitutional
error
has
been
made,
the
complete,
at
constitutionally
complete,
answer
is
he
is
now
a
free
man.
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
that
he
somehow
be
compensated
from
what
might
be
years
of
unjust
incarceration.
mr.
charles
fried
it
is
certainly
relevant.
it
is
relevant
just
as
it
was
in
the
bush
case,
where
the
compensation
was
precisely
what
it
is
here
in
this
case.
i
should
say
that
bush
being
fired
is
indeed
stigmatizing.
i
think
the
claim
that
being
removed
from
the
disability
roles
is
somehow
stigmatizing,
is
a
somewhat
unwarranted
stretch.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
fried
first
it's
important
to
note
that
judge
friendly's
decision
in
ellis
preceded
bush
v.
lucas;
and
i
don't
think
he
would
have
decided
the
case
the
same
way
after
this
court's
guidance
in
bush
v.
lucas.
second,
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
third
sentence
of
405(h),
"no
action
against
the
united
states,
the
secretary,
or
any
office
or
employee
thereof,
shall
be
brought
under
section
1331
to
recover
on
any
claim
arising
under
this
subchapter.
"
mr.
charles
fried
the
michigan
academy
case
is
very
important
on
that
point
because
the
court
recognized
that
it
had...
that
it
was
rowing
uphill;
but
that
it
was
willing
to
do
so
because,
had
there
not
been
a
remedy
that
was
implied
under
1331,
there
would
have
been
no
way
for
those
particular
claims
to
be
brought
before
any
court
whatsoever.
and
that,
this
court
said,
was
weighing
powerfully
in
their
interpretation;
second,
it
found
a
little
bit
of
leeway
because
in
any
event,
i
believe
the
court
said,
in
any
event,
we
are
not
operating
directly
under
405(h)
in
the
third
sentence;
but
only
by
its
incorporation
through
section
1395,
that
was
a
part
b
of
medicare
case.
that
would
seem
to
me
to
suggest
that,
if
you
were
square
in
the
middle
of
405(h),
rather
than
in
one
of
those
peripheral
applications
dragged
in
by
reference
that
you
would
not
have
had
the
same
conclusion.
the
attempt
to
do
in
rungs
around
the
third
sentence
goes
back
to
weinberger
against
salfi,
the
attempt
to
say,
well,
this
is
a
declaratory
judgment;
well,
this
is
procedural;
this
is
prospective-only.
each
time
the
court
has
said,
look,
what
you
are
doing
is
something
which
has
to
do
with
getting
benefits.
these
people
didn't
slip
and
fall
on
the
steps
of
the
social
security
office
and
bring
an
action
for
that
reason;
they
are
bringing
an
action
because
something
that
happened
in
respect
to
the
granting
of
benefits.
and
i
ask
myself,
if
congress
wanted
to
proscribe
1331
jurisdiction
for
a
situation
like
this,
how
much
more
really
could
it
have
spoken?
should
it
have
said,
"and
we
mean
bivens,
too?
"
so
i
think
1331...
i
think
that
405(h)
is
quite
clear
on
this
point;
i
do
think
that
it's
important
to
have
a
little
perspective
on
this
case,
particularly
given
the
very
powerful
presentation
of
the
factual
context.
first,
the
respondents
at
page
6
of
their
brief
say
that
there
are
perhaps
200,000
people
whose
benefits
were
unjustly
terminated
and
then
later
reinstated.
but
the
perspective
i
would
like
to
suggest
is
a
different
one.
there
is
in
the
united
states
no
general
system
at
the
national
level
of
income
maintenance.
there
is
food
stamps;
there
is
afdc;
there
is
unemployment
compensation,
which
is
time-limited;
and
then
there
is
social
security.
in
times
of
economic
dislocation
in
the
late
'70s
and
early
'80s,
when
most
of
these
cases
arose,
were
such
times,
there
is
tremendous
pressure
on
the
system
and
on
congress
to
somehow
stretch
what
is
a
rather
gappy
safety
net
to
cover
more
and
more
serious
cases
which
seem
to
fall
through.
how
to
respond
to
those
pressures
is
a
serious
problem.
i
do
not
think
it
is
sensible
to
respond
by
making
the
cabinet
secretary
personally
liable
as
is
being
sought
to
be
done
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
think
the
court
for
its
attention.
