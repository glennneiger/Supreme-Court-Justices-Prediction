mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondents
in
this
case
spent
their
working
lives
paying
into
title
ii's
disability
insurance
program,
and
they
have
no
quarrel
with
its
comprehensive
design,
the
one
that
the
solicitor-general
praises,
for
deciding
who
gets
what
benefits;
how
errors
are
reviewed
and
corrected;
how
mistakenly-withheld
benefits
are
to
be
recovered
from
the
government.
as
he
correctly
points
out,
the
benefits
were
recovered,
and
they
don't
really
complain
about
where
congress
chose
to
locate
what
the
solicitor-general
in
his
reply
brief,
calls
the
"ballast
of
the
social
security
system.
"
how
tight
a
ship
congress
chose
to
run.
their
point
is,
they
didn't
fall
overboard;
they
allege
that
they
were
pushed.
and
their
complaint
is
that
the
individual
petitioners
in
this
case
deliberately
abused
this
well-designed
machine;
and
abused
their
power
by
setting
arbitrary
quotas.
and
these,
we
think,
are
not
simply
"adverbs"
of
constitutional
import,
even
if
one
doesn't
agree
to
the
exciting
first
english
decision.
i
think
there
was
no
disagreement
with
at
least
that
part
of
justice
stevens'
dissent
that
suggests
that
when
there
are
improperly
motivated,
or
fairly
conducted,
or
unnecessarily
protracted
facts
of
government
decisionmaking.
that's
a
separate
due-process
violation.
and
it
has
been
quite
traditional
for
courts
to
recognize
intentional
abuse
of
process
as
a
tort
quite
distinct
from
any
benefits
lost
and
recovered
along
the
way
according
to
the
exclusive
government
system
for
recovering
those
benefits.
i
think
judge
friendly
was
the
first
to
see
it
in
the
title
ii
context
in
the
second
circuit
in
1981
in
ellis
v.
blum,
when
he
held
that
abusive
termination
of
title
ii
benefits,
which
are
later
restored
retroactively,
give
rise
to
a
bivens
action
under
1331
for
emotional
distress
and
consequential
damages.
actually,
he
may
not
have
been
the
first,
although
the
context
was
a
bit
different.
justice
kennedy,
in
flores
v.
pierce,
in
the
ninth
circuit,
held
that,
when
state
officials
deliberately
and
for
unconstitutional
reasons,
interfere
with
the
attempt
of
a
licensed
applicant
to
obtain
the
license,
the
fact
that
the
license
is
ultimately
obtained
according
to
the
normal
course
of
the
normal
process
does
not
prevent
the
1983
action
seeking
consequential
damages
and
damages
for
emotional
distress
for
the
deliberate
abuse
of
the
process
putting
them
through
the
ringer,
when
they
ought
not
to
have
been
put
through
it.
now,
the
solicitor-general,
i
think,
paints
quite
a
false
picture
when
he
says--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice:
they
claim
in
the
complaint,
and
the
case
arose
on
the
dismissal
of
that
complaint...
they
had
arbitrary
quotas
saying
a
fixed
number
of
people,
regardless
of
any
evidence
of
disability,
have
got
to
be
cut
from
the
rolls...
we
call
it
being
tossed
overboard...
in
order
to
meet
the
pressure
from
"on
high".
budgetary
pressure.
we
will
go
through
the
motions,
"they
claim
the
petitioners
said,
but
we
won't
really
look
at
the
evidence.
"
and
we
also
claim
that
certain
diseases
were
arbitrarily
blacklisted;
that
this
was
an
arbitrary
exertion
of
power.
of
course,
they
haven't
had
the
chance
through
discovery
to
prove
it.
but
what
they
want
is
a
chance
to
prove
it
against
officials
who,
under
this
court's
decision,
are
not
entitled
to
absolute,
but
only
qualified,
immunity.
and
they
want
a
chance
to
prove
it,
not
as
the
solicitor-general
suggests,
by
somehow
reconstructing
this
comprehensive
machine
that
congress
has
ably
developed
for
getting
back
the
benefits
that
were
wrongfully
withheld;
or
mistakenly
withheld;
you
don't
have
to
show
any
wrong;
it's
an
honest
mistake...
to
get
the
benefits
back.
what
is
at
stake
here
is
quite
another
system
altogether:
it
is
a
system
that
this
court
began
to
construct
in
1971
in
the
bivens
case
using
the
constitution's
substantive
provisions
as
a
navigation
chart
using
the
historic,
traditional,
common
law
remedies
as
a
compass;
and
it
is
that
system
that
which
the
solicitor-general
says
ought
now
to
be
withheld
in
this
case.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
as
the
solicitor-general
calls
them,
405>
["],
he
could
have
run
immediately
to
court,
and
that
is
what
it
appears,
the
solicitor-general
counsels,
that
the
best
solution
is
not
damages
which
might
deter
this
misconduct,
but
judicial
interference
without
even
exhausting
remedies,
he
suggests,
immediate
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
now,
some
of
these
disabled
people
are
not
necessarily
capable
of
gearing
up
machinery
that
well.
but
we
don't
disagree
with
this
court's
decision
as
giving
them
that
option.
what
we
suggest
is
that
that
option,
unlike
the
quite-normal
bivens
option,
number
one,
leaves
victims
uncompensated
if
they
don't
get
to
court
on
time.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
is
true--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
if
you
take
advantage
of
bivens,
at
least
after
the
fact,
it
won't,
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
question,
be
too
late.
that
is,
the
bivens
remedy...
presumably,
you
know,
it's
conceivable
that
in
bivens
they
could
have
detected
a
pattern
of
fbi
abuse
and
gone
to
court
to
get
some
kind
of
relief.
but
that
didn't
prevent
this
court
from
giving
them
damages.
the
point
about
this
episodic
intervention
through
injunctive
relief,
is
that
it
raises
all
of
the
prospects--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
these
particular
respondents
did
go
to
court
and
filed
the
complaint
under
1331
seeking
that
relief.
the
reason
that
this
case
is
not
here
under
405(g)
and
(h)
is
that
they
do
not
make
a
claim
that
arises
under
the
act.
it
is
their
point...
and
i
want
to
make
this
as
clear
as
i
can...
that
405(g)
and
(h)
are
fine
provisions
designing
a
limited
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
for
getting
something
from
the
government.
when
405(g)
and
(h)
were
written
in
1939,
it
would
have
been
quite
impossible,
as
the
solicitor-general
points
out
in
his
brief,
to
preclude
bivens
remedies...
impossible,
indeed,
because
it
was
to
be
three
decades
until
a
right
of
action
under
bivens
for
this
kind
of
abuse
was
recognized
by
the
court.
but
the
fact
is
that
that
limited
exposure
of
the
federal
treasury
under
405(g),
and
the
court
called
it
"a
limited
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
"
under
city
of
new
york
v.
bowen,
does
not,
as
the
solicitor-general
suggests,
purport
to
provide,
as
he
put
it
in
his
words,
an
"exclusive
scheme
for
raising
all
issues
regarding
social
security
benefits.
"
the
fact
that
social
security
benefits
exist
in
the
background
did
not
prevent
judge
friendly
from
seeing
in
ellis
v.
blum
that
these
claims
arise
under
the
constitution,
and
not
under
the
act.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
there
are
several
answers,
i
think,
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
the
fact
is
that
here,
unlike
the
civil
service
area,
congress
did
not
calibrate
what
it
wants
to
be
done
to
the
existence
of
any
abuse.
congress
simply
provided
a
way
of
getting
these
benefits
delivered
to
the
right
people.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
seems
to
me
that,
to
answer
the
question
of
what
congress
sort
of
had
in
mind
in
this
area
as
it
revisited
it
over
and
over,
"as
the
solicitor-general
says
it
did
in
the
'80s,
it
is
important
to
understand
what
was
going
on
in
congress
during
the
period
when
this
fine-tuning
occurred.
"
late
last
week,
in
bowen
v.
galbreath,
this
court
pointed
out
that,
when
it
fine-tuned
one
of
the
titles;
that
is,
when
it
passed
title
xvi
of
the
act,
congress,
in
a
telling
omission,
did
not
include
certain
language
that
had
appeared
in
title
ii.
and
that
led
me
to
inquire
over
the
weekend
what
proposals
did
congress
have
before
it
that
might
bear
on
this
question,
during
the
period
of
the
1980s
when
it
was
fine-tuning
the
delivery
system?
and
the
fact
is
that
in
december
1981,
ten
months
after
the
second
circuit
had
applied
bivens
to
the
abusive
termination
of
title
ii
beneficiaries,
secretary
schweiker,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
joined
several
other
cabinet
members
in
officially
urging
congress
to
pass
s.
1775,
which
would
have
ended
bivens
liability
for
most
federal
officers,
including
most
particularly,
officials
of
health
and
human
services,
when
plaintiffs
allege
what
secretary
schweiker
called
"constitutional
torts"
in
the
denial
or
termination
of
benefits.
that
law
had
some
predecessors
in
the
late
'70s
that
this
court
took
note
of
in
carlson.
1775
would
have
actually
given
liability
damages
from
the
u.s.
treasury
from
the
people
who
were
cut
off
as
for
others
who
were
denied
bivens
remedies.
and
yet
it
was
opposed
on
really
two
grounds;
first
that
it
was
not
sufficiently
protective
of
victims;
and
second,
that
it
wouldn't
deter
future
abuses
well
enough.
in
the
end
it
died
in
committee.
and
majority
leader
baker
in
january
1984,
said
on
the
senate
floor,
that
bivens
reforms
of
that
kind
had
proved
too
controversial
to
press
as
part
of
any
other
kind
of
reform.
later
that
year,
unanimously,
congress
passed
the
social
security
reform
act
of
1984.
now,
to
take
from
history,
where
congress
is
adjusting
and
fine-tuning
the
system
for
returning
benefits
withheld
by
honest
mistake,
to
take
from
that
the
lesson
in
this
partnership
between
congress
and
the
court,
that
congress
has
implied
a
negative
with
respect
to
bivens
actions,
for
abusive
termination,
seems
to
me
to
take
the
possibility
of
employing
implied
repeal
of
the
bivens
background
much
further
than
is
justifiable.
i
don't
think
you
can
read
either
in
what
congress
did
in
1939,
before
anyone
dreamed
of
bivens,
when
it
was
really
enacting
a
limited
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
for
what
it
did
do
in
the
1980s
as
somehow
suggesting
that
it
wouldn't
make
sense
for
this
court
to
do
here
what
it
did
in
such
cases
as
bivens
and
davis
and
carlson.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
o'connor,
the
principal
reason
that
is
given
by
the
solicitor-general
that
this
is
a
lot
like
bush
against
lucas
in
his
brief,
is
that
the
social
security
system
is
too
big;
too
complex;
and
the
remedies
are
too
comprehensive.
the
remedies,
as
i
have
just
tried
to
indicate,
are
remedies
against
the
system
for
failing
to
deliver
what
it
promised,
not
for
those
who
deliberately
abused
the
system.
but
the
suggestion
that
it's
vast;
and
that
its
size
is
somehow
the
criterion
that
should
make
it
rather
like
bush,
the
elaborate
civil
service
system,
we
think
is
not
defensible.
in
bush,
and
indeed
later
in
chappell
and
in
stanley,
the
special
factors
were
all
qualitative:
they
related
not
to
size,
but
to
subject
matter,
like
the
commitment
of
federal
personnel
policy,
or
the
incidence
of
military
status
to
the
political
branches.
size;
complexity,
i
don't
think
provide
a
judicially-manageable
line.
in
any
event,
if
the
social
security
system
is
too
big
and
too
complex;
then
why
not
the
federal
law
enforcement
administration?
that
is,
bivens
itself
imposed
damages
remedies
in
a
context
where
there
are
tens
of
thousands
of
law
enforcement
officers;
why
not
prison
administration?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
but--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--we
think,
justice
stevens,
after
daniels
and
davidson,
that
it's
part
of
the
constitutional
violation.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
poor
person
who
can't
buy
food
and
medicine,
whether
the
deprivation
is
the
result
of
some
arbitrary
quota
or
some
honest
mistake,
may
be
a
matter
of
only
academic
interest
that
he
couldn't
really
care
much
about.
but
this
court,
i
think,
made
a
point,
of
which
i
know
that
in
those
cases
you
were
not
in
full
accord,
that
the
ordinary
concept
of
constitutional
command
draws
a
line
between
deliberate
abuse
of
power
and
honest
mistakes;
the
kind
of
thing
that,
in
first
english
could
happen
as
the
regulatory
process
drags
on.
and
we
do
not
think
we
could
make
out
a
procedural
due-process,
or
an
equal
protection
violation,
for
mere
honest
error.
we
think
that,
therefore,
the
fundamental
predicate
of
this
notion
of
abuse
of
process
as
a
constitutional
tort,
is
that
the
abuse
be
knowing,
intentional
and
deliberate;
and
that's
what
we
seek
to
be
able
to
prove
at
trial.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
in
harlow
v.
fitzgerald,
the
court
spelled
out
really
the
contours
of
that
defense:
if
it
would
have
been
in
good
faith
and
a
reasonable
person
could
have
thought
he
was
complying,
it
was
constitutional.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
there
may
well
be.
there
may
well
be
in
the
two,
sometimes,
though
not
always...
certainly
not
in
stanley...
sometimes
coalesce.
but
the
concern
that
officials
not
move
with
great
trepidation,
fearing
that
every
error
of
judgment
in
running
a
massive
bureaucracy
may
expose
them
to
liability,
is
quite
well-dealt
with
by
harlow
v.
fitzgerald
immunity.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
emotional
distress
and
other
kinds
of
consequential
damages
lie
at
the
core.
certainly
in
carey
v.
piphus,
emotional
distress
is
separately,
judicially,
cognizable
if
provable.
and
in
the
flores
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
that
was
at
the
heart
of
it.
but
let
me
return
for
a
moment,
if
i
might,
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
bush
v.
lucas,
because
i
think
there
is
a
deeper
irony
here,
in
that
making
the
magnitude
of
the
system,
its
complexity
a
special
factor
counselling
hesitation
under
bush,
if
you
go
back
to
the
majority
opinion
in
bivens
and
the
justice
harlan's
concurrence,
both
of
those
opinions
stressed
that
damage
liability
is
especially
appropriate
for
federal
officers
because
of
how
much
power
they
can
wield;
how
many
people
they
can
hurt.
it
inverts,
i
think,
the
logic
in
bivens
to
say
that
the
more
people
an
official
can
hurt,
the
less
a
court
should
worry
about
ordinary
garden-variety
compensation
and
deterrence.
the
fact
is
that
petitioners
in
this
case
were
in
a
position
to
inflict
more
injury
without
ever
getting
out
from
behind
their
desks,
than
the
agents
in
bivens
could
inflict
by
breaking
into
bivens'
home.
you
don't
have
to
send
agents
to
grab
the
social
security
checks
that
solicitor-general
fried
says
he's
not
really
sure
are
property;
or
to
repossess
the
groceries
and
the
medicines
that
were
purchased
with
those
checks.
they
didn't
have
to
do
that.
all
they
had
to
do
was
put
in
place
arbitrary
quotas
that
pay
no
attention
to
the
evidence;
and
send
a
functionary
out
with
a
computer-generated
postcard
to
someone
like
mr.
chilicky,
who
is
recovering
from
open-heart
surgery
telling
him,
"you're
fine.
"
"go
back
to
work;
you're
a
dead-beat.
"
i
don't
think
it's
too
speculative
to
say
that
that
is
stigmatizing.
now,
the
fact
that,
when
mr.
chilicky,
when
recovering
from
open
heart
surgery
might
be
able...
and
after
all,
he
did
join
a
lawsuit
quite
early...
might
be
able
to
seek
some
other
form
of
judicial
relief...
does
not
really
bear
on--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
chief
justice
rhenquist.
my
suggestion
is
that,
if
they
deliberately
set
out
to
send
that
kind
of
message
to
people
without
regard
to
whether
they
really
are
disabled,
then
in
that
case
it
is
plausible
to
say
that
this
is
not
just
an
"adverb"
of
constitutional
import;
it
is
a
deliberately-inflicted
stigma.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
some
might
regard
it
as
good
news
to
be
told
that
you
are
no
longer
disabled,
but
others
might
say
that
if
they
spent
their
working
lives
putting
into
a
system,
and
are
then
told
that
they're
lying
about
their
disability,
which
is
what
this
message
is,
it
might
be
stigmatizing.
but
i'm
not
sure
this
bears
on
the
question
whether
there
should
be
a
bivens
action.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
of
course
the
alj--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
scalia,
let
me...
in
fact,
that
does
not
sound
so
sensible.
let
me
recall
this
court's
decisions
in
daniels
and
davis...
a
prisoner
slips
on
a
pillow
and
is
badly
injured.
the
injury
feels
the
same
whether
the
pillow
as
left
there
negligently
or
whether
it
was
left
there
in
a
deliberate
decision
to
"get"
the
prisoners.
this
court
says
that
that
difference
is
the
very
difference
that,
under
the
constitution,
draws
a
line
between
the
existence
of
a
1983
action,
and
the
fact
that
it's
simply
a
misfortune.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
am
understood
as
suggesting
that
stigma
retroactively
colors
the
existence
of
a
violation,
i
don't
mean
to
be
suggesting
that.
and
it's
somewhat
premature
to
talk
here,
i
think,
about
the
precise
damages
that
can
be
proven.
after
all,
in
order
to
get
to
that
stage,
one
has
to
recognize
that
the
threshold...
and
answer
one
way
or
the
other
to
the
question
whether
there
is
an
implied
cause
of
action
at
all
for
damages?
and
then
one
can
figure
out
what
the
damages
are.
part
of
what
i
think
is--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
certainly
the
harm...
for
example,
if
monthly
benefits
needed
to
purchase
medicines
are
withheld,
once
you've
crossed
the
threshold
of
saying
that
they
were
withheld
as
a
result
of
a
deliberate
violation,
then
in
calculating
the
damage,
the
lost
health...
which
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
number
of
dollars
that
the
government
saved
by
not
paying
for
the
medicine,
may
be
quite
right,
justice
scalia.
most
of
the
damage
at
the
end
of
the
day
will
be
the
same,
the
medical,
quantifiable
damage.
whether
there
was
a
constitutional
abuse
that
led
to
the
problem
or
not.
that
is
always
the
case,
i
think,
in
drawing
the
line.
if,
for
example,
in
bivens,
they
had
entered
the
home
in
good
faith,
subject
to
a
malley
v.
briggs
kind
of
immunity,
and
had
proceeded
when
there
to
do
exactly
the
same
kinds
of
things
that
they
did,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
person
who
occupied
that
home,
it
might
have
felt
just
the
same.
but
since
they
would
not
have
violated
the
constitution
the
bivens
remedy
would
not
be
available.
that's
really
not
unique
to
this
situation:
i
think
that
observation
goes
to
the
question
whether
bivens
itself
should
somehow
be
overruled.
and
i
don't
think
that
any
argument
has
been
made
here
that
it
ought
to.
the
only
argument
that's
been
made
really
is
that
somehow
this
is
more
like
bush
v.
lucas.
but
what
was
peculiar
in
bush
v.
lucas,
and
absent
here,
was
the
close
relationship
between
federal
employer
and
federal
employee,
which
led
congress
over
a
60-year
period
continually
to
revisit
the
area
and
provide
closely
calibrated
remedies;
that
is,
if
someone
were
fired
as
part
of
an
efficiency
reorganization,
even
though
himself
perfectly
innocent:
no
remedy.
a
decision
was
made
for
impermissible
reasons
not
to
hire
him,
there
would
be
a
limited
remedy,
a
petition
to
the
osc.
if
he
was
demoted
or
fired
abusively
the
remedy
would
be
greater.
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
within
this
area
congress
has
calibrated
the
decision
to
return
the
benefit
to
the
wronged;
indeed,
the
solicitor-general's
argument
about
mathews
v.
eldridge
proves
the
opposite.
the
point
about
mathews
v.
eldridge
is
that
there
was
no
violation
from
the
mere
mistaken
termination
of
benefits.
as
this
court
held
in
mathews
v.
eldridge,
title
ii,
as
opposed
to
title
xvi,
the
constitutional
requirement
that
the
risk
error
be
kept
within
acceptable
bounds,
is
fully
met
by
a
post-deprivation
mechanism
for
correction;
it's
very
much
like
the
provision
of
just
compensation
for
a
taking.
the
taking
doesn't
violate
the
constitution
as
long
as
the
compensation
is
provided.
it's
strange
the
language,
as
well
as
an
understanding
of
what
congress
was
doing
to
say
that
the
mechanism
for
internal
correction
requires
simply
to
keep
the
ship
within
the
bounds
of
mathews
v.
eldridge
is
somehow
a
correction,
a
remedy,
for
quite
separate
constitutional
abuse.
the
very
fact
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes?
it's
a
question
about
the
deliberate
element
of
your
tort,
because
i
really
haven't
been
able
to
think
it
through:
when
you
say
"deliberate",
do
you
mean
that
they
just...
they
intended
that
people
would
not
get
benefits
the
statute
entitled
them
to;
or
that
they
deliberately
violated
some
constitutional
procedure?
what
is
the
deliberateness
here?
the
notion
is
that,
fully-knowing,
a
significant
number
of
the
persons
that
they
would
terminate
under
these
quotas
were
deserving,
and
would,
if
they
pursued
reinstatement
and
retroactive
benefits,
be
likely
to
succeed,
nonetheless,
they
decided
for
fiscal
or
other
reasons,
knowing
that
this
had
no
relationship
to
particular
evidence
in
the
case,
to
impose
and
enforce
these
quotas...
whether
they
also
had
to
have
it
in
their
heads
that
this
court
in
1994
in
the
hertado
case
said
that
such
arbitrary
action
violates
the
constitution,
i'm
not
sure.
i
suspect
that,
in
order
to
be
liable
of
deliberate
constitutional
abuses
of
this
kind,
officials
do
not
have
to
couch
their
improper
intent
in
constitutional
terms;
but
they
would
surely,
though
i'm
sure
that
this
is
somewhat
of
a
different
issue,
the
harlow
v.
fitzgerald
defense,
if
they
acted
in
an
objectively
reasonable
belief,
that
what
they
did
comported
with
the
requirements
of
the
constitution.
the
suggestion
that
the
bureaucratic
apparatus
of
the
social
security
system
is
too
complex
and
too
large
to
be
subjected
to
a
system
of
judicially-developed,
quite
ordinary
remedies,
is
one
that
might
be
made
to
congress,
as
it
has
been;
but
when
it
was
made
to
congress...
when
petitioner
schweiker,
for
example,
joined
other
cabinet
members
in
urging
congress
to
get
rid
of
bivens
it's
striking
that
he
did
not
say,
or
even
suggest,
that
those
who
are
injured
through
what
he
described
as
"constitutional
torts"
in
abusive
terminations,
ought
to
be
left
without
any
damages
at
all.
the
suggestion
rather
was
that
there
should
be
damages
from
the
united
states
treasury;
the
precise
measure
of
those
damages
is
a
question
for
a
different
day.
and
even
that
congress
resisted.
so
the
idea
that,
if
you
look
at
congress
not
only
laterally
over
time,
but
you
find
some
implicit
congressional
determination,
that
the
ordinary
judicial
approach
of
after-the-fact
damages
for
deliberately
inflicted
harm
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
the
idea
that
one
can
find
a
congressional
mechanism--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
stevens,
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor-general
that
it's
in
the
billions
of
dollars,
i
think
assumes
the
capacity
of
proof
on
the
part
of
respondents,
that
in
my
wildest
imagination,
i
would
not
assume.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
problem--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--they
pray
for
at
least
$10,000
each
against
each
respondent.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
not
a
class
action.
there
are
remaining
three
and
only
three
respondents.
they
are
people
in
their
fifty's
and
sixties;
the
class
is
not
a
certified
class.
so
that
the
problem...
i
mean,
i
suppose
one
could
try
to
compute
what
would
happen
under
all
of
the
bivens
remedies
authorized
by
this
court
if
the
millions
of
people
who
could
potentially
sue
were
all
to
sue
the
government,
it
would
be
staggering.
but
the
suggestion
of
an
avalanche
of
liability
is
rather
belied;
as
i
understand
it,
in
all
of
the
years
since
bivens
was
decided
in
1971,
there
have
been
a
grand
total
of
some
two
dozen,
as
of
several
years
ago,
of
actual
damage
recoveries
under
bivens.
it's
not
so
easy
to
prove
that
government
officials
deliberately
set
out
to
violate
your
constitutional
rights.
and
i
wouldn't
be
too
sanguine
about
the
ability
of
people
to
prove
that
in
a
way
that
would
pose
grave
threats
for
the
fiscal
stability
of
the
government.
but
if
such
threats
were
posed,
it
is
the
congress
that
has
the
power
of
the
purse;
it
is
congress
who
can
decide
whether
deliberately
abusive
officials
should
be
indemnified;
and
congress
who
could
put
realistic
caps
on
damage
recovery.
but
in
the
absence
of
such
action
by
congress,
the
course
on
which
this
court
embarked
in
1971
in
bivens
seems
to
me
not
really
to
stop
short
of
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
judge
friendly
was
right
in
recognizing
that
cases
like
this
do
not
arise
under
the
social
security
act;
but
arise
under
the
constitution;
it
seems
to
me
that
the
traditional
recognition
that
abuse
of
power
is
quite
separate
from
material
things
that
one
happens
to
have
lost;
points
to
bivens
in
this
case;
and
not
to
bush
v.
lucas.
bush,
stanley,
chappell,
deal
with
special
matters
with
special
status.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
justice.
