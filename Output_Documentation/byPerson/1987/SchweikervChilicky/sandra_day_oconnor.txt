justice
o'connor
well,
how
do
you
supply
the
"due
process"
when
it's
too
late?
do
we
do
that
in
damages?
how
do
we
do
that?
justice
o'connor
this
case
seems
a
lot
closer
to
bush
against
lucas
than
any
of
those,
i
must
say.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
fried,
do
you
think
the
court
gave
that
less
than
a
literal
reading
in
bowan
against
michigan
academy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
schweiker
case,
it
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
improper
denial
of
social
security
disability
benefits
allegedly
resulting
from
due
process
violations
by
government
officials
who
administered
the
disability
program
may
give
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
for
money
damages
against
those
officials.
under
the
social
security
program,
disabled
people
are
entitled
to
monthly
benefits
if
they're
unable
to
work
at
paying
jobs.
in
1980,
congress
enacted
a
statute
requiring
periodic
review
of
the
medical
status
of
these
people
with
an
eye
toward
determining
whether
they
remained
eligible
under
the
program.
a
state
agency
usually
made
the
initial
determination
about
continued
eligibility
and
recipients
were
then
free
to
seek
administrative
review
of
adverse
decisions.
benefits,
however,
were
cut
off
during
the
administrative
review
process.
in
1983,
congress
learned
that
large
numbers
of
people
were
improperly
being
terminated
by
state
agencies
only
to
have
their
benefits
restored
after
further
administrative
review.
congress
enacted
emergency
reform
legislation
which
was
extended
the
following
year
and
provided
among
other
things
that
recipients
could
continue
to
receive
benefits
during
the
review
process.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
individuals
whose
benefits
were
improperly
terminated
before
the
reform
legislation.
although
they
received
full
retroactive
restoration
of
their
benefits,
they
were
not
compensated
for
emotional
distress
and
other
damages
they
suffered
as
a
result
of
the
long
delays
that
preceded
the
restoration
of
benefits.
they
sued
the
petitioners,
one
state
and
two
federal
officials
responsible
for
administering
the
program,
seeking
to
recover
money
damages
for
these
injuries.
the
respondents
alleged
that
the
wrongful
termination
of
benefits
had
resulted
from
due
process
violations
in
the
structure
and
administration
of
the
disability
review
process.
the
federal
district
court
dismissed
the
lawsuit
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
remedy
sought
by
respondents
would
be
available
if
they
could
prove
their
case.
the
court
relied
on
our
1971
decision
in
bivens
against
the
six
unknown
agents
which
created
a
similar
remedy
for
constitutional
violations
by
federal
law
enforcement
officers.
we
find
that
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
our
more
recent
decision
in
bush
versus
lucas.
in
that
case,
we
held
that
an
action
in
money
damages
against
federal
officials
would
not
be
recognized
were
congress
has
already
constructed
an
elaborate
remedial
scheme
or
system
that
gives
meaningful
protections
to
individual
rights
even
though
it
does
not
provide
complete
relief.
although
we
recognized
that
some
injuries
will
go
uncompensated
under
this
system,
we
hold
that
the
courts
are
not
at
liberty
to
create
new
remedies
that
would
rearrange
congress'
allocation
of
scarce
resources
in
a
large
welfare
benefits
program
like
the
one
at
issue
here.
because
the
relief
sought
by
the
respondents
is
unavailable
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
case
must
be
dismissed
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
contrary
is
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
have
joined.
