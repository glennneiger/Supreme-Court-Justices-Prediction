chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
argument
next
to
number
94
original,
the
state
of
south
carolina
versus
james
a.
baker
iii.
mr.
linton,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
mr.
linton,
the
master
also
found
that
there
was
very
little
economic
loss
to
the
states
as
a
result
of
that
choice,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
it
--
is
it
a
purely
dignitary
kind
of
interest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
that
is
the
--
you
can
(inaudible)
that
there's
no
economic
harm
to
the
state
of
south
carolina
that
results
from
this
--
the
tefra
§310?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
--
what
then
is
the
economic?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
a
long
time
ago,
chief
justice
marshall
and
i
think
it
was
the
mcculloch
against
maryland
said,
“the
power
to
tax
is
the
power
to
destroy.”
and
justice
holmes
came
along
a
100
years
later
and
said,
“the
power
to
tax
is
not
the
power
to
destroy,”
while
this
court
sets,
and
it
seems
to
me,
you're
making
an
argument
that
probably
would
have
appeal
the
great
deal
to
chief
justice
marshall
but
perhaps
hasn't
weathered
too
well
in
later
opinions
of
the
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
linton,
are
you
saying
that
any
federal
regulation
of
the
states
have
authority
to
raise
money
by
issuing
bonds
is
--
is
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
--
and
you're
saying,
interfering
with
the
right
of
the
state
to
borrow,
even
though
only
tiny
economic
consequences
may
--
may
flow.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
but
of
course
the
united
states
and
the
states
do
not
operate
on
a
totally
two-way
street
in
our
system.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
linton.
we'll
hear
now
from
you
mr.
kaden.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
will
come
(inaudible)
this
conscription
has
been
affected.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
eeoc
and
it's
--
it
differs
for
90
days
to
state
equal
employment
commission
proceedings
if
the
state
creates
one
that
it
certainly
provides
a
strong
incentive
for
a
state
to
create
wanted
by
legislation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
also
--
congress
also
said
in
the
eeoc
that
if
a
state
creates
its
own
board,
the
federal
commission
will
defer
proceedings
for
90
days.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kaden.
we'll
hear
now
from
you
general
fried.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
general
fried,
if
that
was
the
case,
why
did
all
those
states
issue
their
bonds
in
bearer
form
before
the
§310
was
enacted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
fried,
does
congress
require
states
as
employers
to
withhold
of
the
federal
income
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
fried.
mr.
linton,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
linton.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
94
original,
south
carolina
against
baker
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
