that
would

mr.
fried,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
it
would
be
constitutional
for
congress
to
pass
the
statute
that
says,
if
any
state
shall
issue
unregistered
bonds,
the
governor
of
the
state
shall
be
deemed
to
have
violated
the
federal
criminal
statute
and
shall
be
sentence
to
prison
for
three
years
if
the
--
if
the
--
where
the
sanction
is
a
plainly
unconstitutional
sanction,
it
really
doesn't
matter
because
all
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
something
that's
perfectly
trivial.
justice
stevens
if
you
accept
justice
o'connor's
premise,
that
is.
what's
the
difference
between
that
case
and
when
i
pass
it?
justice
stevens
nothing
is
at
stake
if
they
comply.
justice
stevens
so,
that
in
my
example,
you
would
say,
you
can
threaten
them
with
anything,
threatened
the
governor
with
capital
punishment.
justice
stevens
no,
i
would
--
justice
stevens
--
very
narrowly
define
class
of
persons
in
a
very
definitely
defined
aggravating
circumstance,
it
