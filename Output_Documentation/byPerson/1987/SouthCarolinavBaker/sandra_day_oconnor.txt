justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
linton,
do
we
look
at
this
as
tax
or
as
a
regulation?
there
seems
to
be
some
disagreement
on
that
besides
the
point.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
because
it
--
it's
sort
of
a
threat
based
on
an
unconstitutional
sanction
in
your
view
that
the
--
the
government
can't
regulate
the
nature
of
their
bond
issue
by
threatening
the
imposition
of
an
unconstitutional
sanction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
we
accept
all
of
the
master's
findings
of
fact
which
is
the
chief
justice
suggest
indicate
basically
that
in
this
particular
instance,
it's
not
a
terrible
burden
economically
on
the
states.
now,
what
if
we
accept
that?
you
want
us
to
rely
primarily
on
the
old
pollock
case
and
inter-governmental
tax
immunity,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
bottom,
what
does
it
rest
on
textually
in
the
constitution
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
states
today
tax
the
interest
income
on
federal
government
issuance's
of
securities?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
will
you
take
the
position
that
this,
all
the
state
municipal
bonds
pledge
the
credit
of
the
states
or
the
municipalities?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
linton,
what
if
congress
said
in
your
commerce
power
that
no
one
who
buys
one
of
these
bonds
may
transfer
it
without
registration,
and
the
practical
effect
of
that
is
to
also
make
the
states
have
to
register
their
bonds.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
saying,
â€œwhat
if",
can
congress
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
understood
even
--
even
your
interveners,
national
governors'
association
thought
congress
could
do
what
i
suggested,
but
you
take
issue
with
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
said
the
practical
effect
of
it
is
going
to
be
that
states
are
going
to
have
to
register
their
bond.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
kaden,
every
time
congress
gets
under
the
act
with
one
of
its
programs
that
wants
the
states
to
help
them
out
with,
you
have
the
same
kind
of
a
problem.
the
states
have
to
crank
up
their
machinery
and
do
something
about
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--
mr.
fried
argues
that
the
state
has
the
choice
of
coercive
issuing
bearer
bonds
and
letting
people
pay
the
tax.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
congress
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--
could
congress
have
achieved
the
same
goal
exactly
by
some
other
means
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--
that
you
would
accept?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fried,
do
you
think
that's
objecting
all
interest
income
from
municipal
bonds,
the
federal
income
tax
could
be
said
to
interfere
with
essential
state
or
local
functions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
so,
how
do
you
answer
me?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you're
not
going
to
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--
answer
my
question
of
whether
there
is
any
constitutional
limit
to
the
removal
of
the
freedom
from
federal
income
tax
of
these
bonds.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
would
it
rest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
concern
because
i'm
not
sure
to
what
extent
we
have
to
address
in
this
case,
the
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
states
are
urging
that
we
must
address
it
and
it
is
a
concern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
fried,
supposed
one
thought
indeed
as
i
made
that
there
is
a
constitutional
prohibition
against
the
federal
government
taxing
income
from
these
municipal
bonds,
may
the
congress
just
use
that
forum
of
imposing
a
tax
as
a
meanings
of
regulation
and
we
should
close
our
eyes
to
the
forum
chosen?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
the
mean
selected
should
be
proper?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
no
other
way
the
government
could
have
accomplished
its
goal?
