mr.
john
p.
linton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
south
carolina
invoked
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
protect
the
sovereign
right
to
borrow
money.
south
carolina
seeks
the
issue
in
its
general
obligation
bonds
which
pledge
the
full
faith
credit
taxing
power
of
the
state
without
intrusion
by
the
national
government
because
future
state
revenues
pledge
to
retire
the
debt
represented
by
the
bond,
power
to
borrow
here
is
inextricably
linked
with
the
obligation
to
tax
and
retire
that
debt.
twenty-two
states
have
joined
south
carolina
as
amicus
in
the
national
government's
association
is
sought
to
intervene
as
a
plaintiff.
congress
by
tefra
§310(b)
asserts
the
right
to
tax
the
general
obligation
in
the
state
of
south
carolina.
thus,
congress
claims
the
right
to
tax
the
state
revenue.
it
claims
the
right
to
interfere
with
the
state
of
south
carolina
to
borrow.
congress
has
assert
to
right
in
an
impermissible
area
in
an
impermissible
manner.
sanction
in
the
registration
requirement
interfere
with
the
state
right
to
borrow
and
it
operates
as
a
tax
upon
the
tax
revenues.
i'd
like
to
point
out
a
few
findings
of
the
master
which
i
believe
a
critical
to
the
correct
disposition.
the
master
found
that
the
loss
of
the
tax
exemption
threat
is
a
penalty
of
such
severity
that
the
states
have
no
choice.
the
master
pointed
out
that
prior
to
tefra
every
state
issued
its
bonds
(inaudible)
and
it
sets
the
statute
has
been
passed,
no
state
has
issued
its
bonds
and
(inaudible)
they
have
also
rendered
the
right
to
issue
their
instruments
because
of
the
sanction
that's
been
imposed.
mr.
john
p.
linton
the
master
did
find
it,
your
honor.
he
--
and
i'll
turn
to
one
other
finding
of
the
master
that
i
think
is
adverse
to
us
that
is
advantageous
to
the
court.
the
master
said
that
the
interest
of
the
states
in
borrow
bonds
goes
to
the
forum
and
not
to
the
(inaudible)
we
accept
to
that
finding.
it's
incorrect.
the
issue
on
the
registration
requirement
and
the
manner
in
which
the
states
issue
its
bonds
is
the
right
of
the
states
to
determine
what
--
what
conditions
in
their
bond
instruments
the
state
feels
would
appeal
to
the
market
place.
it's
the
same
interest
(inaudible)
by
this
court
in
bland
versus
(inaudible)
in
dealing
with
the
savings
bond
to
the
united
states.
this
court
held
that
if
the
states
would
interfere
with
the
(inaudible)
in
that
instance,
it
would
threaten
the
right
of
the
united
states
in
its
ability
to
borrow
money.
that's
the
same
right
that
we're
asserting
here.
mr.
john
p.
linton
no.
mr.
john
p.
linton
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
linton
well,
first
of
all,
the
master
found
that
in
certain
circumstances,
it
would
be
economic
harm.
the
master
found
that
76%
of
the
bond
is
issued
in
this
country
or
under
10
million
dollars,
and
that
registration
requirement
would
cost
extra
expense
to
the
state.
we
don't
measure
the
issue
here,
your
honor,
though
by
the
cost
in
the
registration
to
sanction.
we
saw
the
original
jurisdiction
here
because
the
sanction
threatens
the
right
of
the
states
in
an
impermissible
way
and
in
an
impermissible
area.
mr.
john
p.
linton
your
honor,
we
think
it
has
weathered
well.
if
i
may
point
out,
one
other
finding
of
the
special
master,
he
noted
the
significance
in
the
state
constitutions
when
it
comes
to
the
issuance
of
state
bonds
pledging
general
obligations
and
the
master
said,
“the
power
of
taxation
in
spending
associated
with
that
right
to
raise
funds
for
a
debt
issuance
or
essential
to
the
exercise
of
sovereignty.”
now,
your
honor,
i'll
turn
to
the
new
york
decision
if
--
because
i
recognized
that
in
new
york
and
both
massachusetts,
you
have
--
you
have
discarded
the
(inaudible)
of
the
right
to
powers
--
excuse
me,
the
power
to
tax
is
a
power
to
destroy.
but
what
justice
frankfurter
recognized
in
new
york
was
that
if
you
have
a
commercial
enterprise
that
you
made
tax
of
state
there
and
we're
not
just
going
to
have
a
label,
but
he
also
said
this,
“there
is
an
irreducible
core
of
federalism
and
their
certain
attributes
of
states
that
partake
of
special
relationships.”
he
said,
“only
a
state
can
own
a
state
house.”
only
a
state
can
raise
funds
by
pledge
of
taxation
and
that's
what
we
have
here
is
the
authority
of
congress
to
claim
that
it
could
tax
us
as
a
sanction.
congress
says,
“it
has
the
right
to
tax
the
general
tax
revenues
--
mr.
john
p.
linton
yes,
your
honor.
we
--
we
believe
the
proper
inquiry
is
the
question
of
whether
the
congress
can
assert
as
a
sanction,
the
right
to
tax
the
states.
that
is
an
impermissible
assertion
by
congress
and
that
the
jurisdictional
arguments,
the
solicitor
--
mr.
john
p.
linton
it
has
a
--
that
is
the
core
of
it,
your
honor,
and
the
other
aspect
of
it
is
the
heart
of
the
right
of
that
states
recognized
in
this
immunity
from
taxation
by
the
national
government
as
to
debt
which
is
backed
up
by
its
general
obligation
taxing
power
is
to
tailor
that
instrument
in
a
manner
in
which
the
state
fields
is
most
appropriate
to
market.
mr.
john
p.
linton
we
ask
you
to
rely
on
the
pollock
case
to
the
extent
that
it
is
still
the
law
of
this
court,
but
we
also
point
to
the
massachusetts
case
in
which
what
the
court
said
is
we're
not
going
to
get
caught
up
in
the
question
of
whether
immunity
applies
to
a
user
fee.
but
the
court
there
recognized
that
there
is
certain
interest
of
the
states
not
to
be
regulated
by
the
national
government
when
it
comes
to
the
taxing
power.
i
think
the
--
mr.
john
p.
linton
the
tax
immunity
doctrine,
your
honor?
the
tax
immunity
doctrine
is
bottomed
on
not
only
the
tenth
amendment
but
the
nature
of
the
compact
that
there
was
an
agreement
whereby
the
national
government
and
the
states
were
to
maintain
sovereignty.
mr.
john
p.
linton
your
honor,
according
to
--
no,
the
answer
is
no,
and
under
the
rockford
case,
i
think
the
issue
--
that
was
decided
by
this
court
last
june,
so
long
as
the
interest
on
those
bonds
is
a
pledge
of
the
united
states,
we
would
not
be
able
to
tax
revenues.
mr.
john
p.
linton
the
issue
that
we
have
--
we
invoked
jurisdiction
on
is
a
general
obligation
bond
which
pledges
the
full
faith
credit
and
taxing
power
of
state
of
south
carolina.
mr.
john
p.
linton
a
regulation
that
interferes
with
the
right
a
state
to
borrow.
mr.
john
p.
linton
of
course,
the
issue
is
not
economic
consequences.
the
issue
as
far
as
the
registration
goes
is
the
invasion
of
the
right
of
a
state
to
determine
the
terms
of
the
debt
instrument.
and
that's
--
this
court
recognized
in
bland
versus
free
is
applied
to
the
united
states
was
incidental
to
the
right
to
borrow
and
not
to
be
interfered
with
by
the
states.
mr.
john
p.
linton
your
honor,
we
recognize
that,
but
what
this
court
said
in
new
york
was
there
is
irreducible
core
of
federalism.
and
there,
justice
frankfurter
was
particularly
concerned
with
the
rights
of
the
states
when
you're
dealing
with
taxation.
justice
frankfurter
went
on
to
say
that
there
are
unique
characteristics
of
the
states
and
even
a
non-discriminatory
tax
would
--
would
violated
the
states'
rights
if
it
happens
to
tax
states
as
states,
that's
the
sanction
sought
to
be
imposed
here.
mr.
john
p.
linton
your
honor,
you're
correct
in
one
sense
that
you
say
that
it's
the
tax
on
the
bond
procedure
is
the
owner.
but
from
a
standpoint
the
way
this
court
deals
with
that,
you
have
held
that
it
is
a
tax
on
the
state
and
it
is
a
tax
--
it
is
an
interference
with
the
right
of
the
state
to
borrow.
that's
not
just
going
back
to
pollock,
last
june
when
this
court
decided
the
rockford
life
case,
the
test
that
you
used
for
a
debt
instrument,
it
was
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
was
as
far
as
interest
payments,
you
said
that
it
would
be
on
the
united
states.
in
that
case,
you
did
not
resolve
the
issue
adverse
to
the
united
states
because
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
the
issue,
it
was
only
a
--
mr.
john
p.
linton
no,
sir
and
the
courts
rejected
that
argument.
the
court
has
accepted
the
proposition
that
when
you
interfere
with
the
right
of
the
state
to
borrow,
you
interfere
impermissibly
with
the
state.
mr.
john
p.
linton
because
--
mr.
john
p.
linton
the
court
makes
the
distinction
between
the
attenuated
effect
on
the
sales
tax
example
on
the
tax
of
employees
versus
the
states'
obligation
to
tax
in
the
future,
the
states
--
that
affects
on
the
bond
aspect
when
you're
dealing
with
general
obligations
is
the
obligation
the
state
to
tax
is
citizens
to
retire
that
debt,
it
interferes
with
--
mr.
john
p.
linton
--
states
to
borrow.
mr.
john
p.
linton
it
would
be
unconstitutional
because
it
conveyed
the
rights
of
--
mr.
john
p.
linton
yes,
sir.
it
would
be
unconstitutional
because
it
invades
the
right
of
the
state
to
determine
the
full
of
its
instrument
and
tailor
it
to
the
marketplace.
but
in
this
case,
of
course,
it's
unconstitutional
as
well
because
of
the
sanction
that
it
seeks
to
impose
that
robs
the
states
of
any
meaningful
alternative.
that's
what
the
master
found
the
united
states
is
not
accepted
to
it
--
mr.
john
p.
linton
your
honor,
the
congress
was
not
exercising
its
commerce
power
--
mr.
john
p.
linton
we
--
we
think
that
a
different
test
applies
under
the
taxing
power.
if
congress
did
that
under
the
commerce
power,
if
it
had
the
effect
of
regulating
the
states
where
there
was
no
meaningful
choice,
i
think
we
would
be
back
to
the
issues
as
addressed
in
the
dissent
in
new
york
by
justice
douglas.
these
tax
regulations
have
a
tremendous
regulatory
effect
and
they
would
rob
the
states
of
the
ability
to
govern
their
own
citizens.
mr.
john
p.
linton
i
--
i
think
you
introduced
that
if
they
--
it
was
so
coercive
that
they
had
absolutely
no
choice.
mr.
john
p.
linton
but
they
could
--
congress
could
do
perhaps
under
the
commerce
clause
without
invading
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
because
then
the
states
would
have
chosen
to
go
into
an
area,
it
is
regulated
under
the
constitution,
the
interstate
commerce
is
regulated
exclusively
by
congress.
under
the
taxing
clause,
that's
not
true
because
we
go
back
to
the
hamilton's
words
that
we
--
the
taxing
power
was
not
coextensive
with
the
commerce
power.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
has
acknowledged
that
this
court
has
not
passed
upon
that
in
page
25
in
his
brief.thank
you.
mr.
john
p.
linton
mr.
chief
justice,
the
interest
asserted
by
south
carolina
is
that
congress
assumes
right
to
tax
a
state
and
rather
than
being
a
trivial
aspect
of
this
case,
that
is
the
--
the
foremost
issue
before
the
court.
the
question
imposed
by
justice
scalia
about
the
tax
on
bonds
proceeds,
according
to
this
court
in
rockford,
that's
a
tax
on
the
united
states.
in
reversed
situation,
it's
a
tax
on
the
state
here.
and
in
response
to
justice
blackmun's
question
about
pollock,
you
cannot
apply
the
rule
of
new
york
versus
united
states
or
massachusetts
versus
united
states
and
sustain
the
action
here.
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
court
was
mindful
of
the
proposition
that
you
cannot
tax
the
power
to
borrow.
that's
what
this
court
also
said
in
1962
in
free
versus
bland
when
the
state
had
what
makes
him
a
trivial
interest
to
assert
on
the
form
of
the
savings
bond.
in
this
court
said
unanimously
in
the
seventh
to
zero
opinion
that
that
interferes
with
the
ability
of
the
federal
treasury
officials
to
determine
the
form
of
the
instrument.
they
are
charged
with
--
with
the
responsibility
for
raising
debt
and
it
would
interfere
with
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
borrow.
that's
the
exact
principles
involved
in
this
case.
thank
you.
