justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
an
original
action
brought
by
the
state
of
south
carolina,
with
lieu
of
this
court,
against
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
of
the
united
states.
section
310(b)(1)
of
the
tax
equity
and
fiscal
responsibility
act
of
1982
removes
the
federal
income
tax
exemption
for
interest
earned
on
publicly
offered
long-term
bonds
issued
by
state
and
local
governments
unless
those
bonds
are
issued
and
registered
as
opposed
to
bearer
form.
south
carolina
invoked
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
contending
that
section
310(b)(1)
is
constitutionally
invalid
under
the
tenth
amendment
and
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity.
we
appointed
a
special
master,
after
conducting
hearings
and
taking
evidence,
he
concluded
that
section
310(b)(1)
is
constitutional
and
recommended
entering
judgment
for
the
secretary.
the
case
is
now
here
on
exceptions
to
the
special
master's
report
filed
by
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
by
the
national
governors'
association
as
an
intervenor.
we
hold
that
section
310(b)(1)
in
agreement
with
the
special
master
does
not
violate
the
tenth
amendment
or
constitutional
principles
of
federalism
by
effectively
compelling
states
to
issue
bonds
in
registered
form.
the
tenth
amendment
limits
on
congress'
authority
to
regulate
state
activities
are
structural,
not
substantive
i.e.
the
states
must
find
their
protection
from
congressional
regulation
through
the
national
political
process,
not
through
judicially
defined
the
spheres
of
unregulable
state
activity.
in
this
case,
south
carolina
has
not
even
alleged
that
it
was
deprived
of
any
right
to
participate
in
the
national
political
process
or
that
it
was
singled
out
in
a
way
that
left
it
politically
isolated
and
powerless.
the
allegations
south
carolina
does
make
that
congress
was
uninformed
and
chose
an
ineffective
remedy
do
not
amount
to
an
allegation
that
the
political
process
operated
in
a
defective
manner,
and
the
governors'
contention
that
section
310
is
invalid
because
it
commandeers
the
state
legislative
and
administrative
process
by
coercing
states
into
enacting
legislation
authorizing
bond
registration
and
into
administering
the
registration
scheme
finds
no
support
in
our
precedents.
section
310
regulates
state
activities.
it
does
not
seek
to
control
or
influence
the
matter
in
which
states
regulate
private
parties
that
the
state
wishing
to
engage
in
certain
activity
must
take
administrative
and
sometimes
legislative
action
to
comply
with
federal
standards,
regulating
that
activity
is
a
commonplace
that
presents
no
constitutional
defect,
and
section
310(b)(1)
does
not
violate
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
by
taxing
the
interest
earned
on
unregistered
stated
bonds.
so
section
310(b)(1)
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
holding
in
1894
in
pollock
v.
farmers'
loan
&
trust
co.,
that
state
bond
interest
was
immune
from
a
nondiscriminatory
federal
tax,
but
that
decision
has
been
effectively
overruled
by
subsequent
case
law
and
today
we
formally
overruled
pollock.
under
the
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
jurisprudence
prevailing
at
pollock's
time,
neither
the
federal
nor
the
state
governments
could
tax
income
that
an
individual
directly
derived
from
any
contact
with
the
other
government.
this
general
rule
was
based
on
the
rationale
that
any
tax
on
income
a
party
received
under
a
contract
with
the
government
was
a
tax
on
the
contract
and
thus
a
tax
on
the
government
because
it
burdened
the
government's
power
to
enter
into
the
contract.
that
rationale
has
been
repudiated
by
modern
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
case
law,
and
the
owners
of
state
bonds
have
no
constitutional
entitlement
not
to
pay
taxes
on
income
they
earn
from
the
bond
and
states
have
no
constitutional
entitlement
to
issue
bonds
paying
lower
interest
rates
than
other
issuers.
the
nondiscriminatory
tax
under
section
310
is
imposed
on
and
collected
from
bondholders
not
from
the
states
and
any
increased
administrative
costs
incurred
by
states
in
implementing
the
registration
system
are
not
taxes
within
the
meaning
of
the
tax
immunity
doctrine.
moreover,
the
provisions
of
section
310
seek
to
insure
that
all
publicly
offered
long-term
bonds
are
issued
in
registered
form,
whether
issued
by
state
or
local
governments
by
the
federal
government
or
by
private
corporation.
therefore,
the
exceptions
to
the
special
master's
support
are
all
overruled
and
judgment
is
ended
for
the
secretary.
justice
scalia
joins
all
the
court's
opinion
except
part
2
and
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
and
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
