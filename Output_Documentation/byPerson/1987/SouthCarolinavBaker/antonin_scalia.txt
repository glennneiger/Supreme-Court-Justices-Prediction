justice
scalia
but
it
doesn't
tax
the
states.
i
mean
formally,
the
tax
is
not
laid
upon
the
states.
if
--
if
we
had
a
statute
that
says,
any
--
any
issuer
of
debt
security
shall
pay
a
tax
of
x
dollars,
then
we
would
have
a
tax
on
the
state.
this
is
a
tax
upon
the
receipt
of
income
by
an
individual.
so,
its
one
step
remove
from
a
formal
tax
on
the
state
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me,
the
only
way
you
can
get
at
it
is
to
say,
â€œwell,
it's
not
formally
a
tax
on
the
state
but
its
effect
is
such
that,
and
then
you
get
into
discussions
about
indeed
how
severe
is
the
effect
and
it's
acknowledged
that
its
pretty
negligible.
justice
scalia
what
about
a
sales
tax,
the
burden
of
which
is
born
by
the
purchaser?
would
say
that
an
individual
who
is
purchasing
something
with
the
income
that
he
has
received
from
a
state
bond
cannot
be
charged
that
sales
tax
because
after
all,
the
only
purpose
of
getting
the
money
from
the
state
bond
is
to
spend
it,
and
if
you
tax
that
spending,
you
traced
it
back
to
the
money
coming
from
the
state,
you're
burdening
the
state,
would
you
say
that?
justice
scalia
well,
why
doesn't
that
interfere
with
the
right
to
borrow?
that's
what
i'm
saying.
that
interferes
with
the
right
to
borrow.
justice
scalia
the
only
reason
--
the
only
reason
you
loan
a
stake
money
is
to
get
the
interest,
the
only
reason
you
want
the
interest
is
to
spend
it
and
you're
interfering
with
my
right
to
spend
it.
justice
scalia
on
the
--
on
the
threat
of
the
people
who
--
who
are
having
the
bonds,
not
having
the
tax
deduction.
justice
scalia
what
about
the
55-mile
speed
limit?
justice
scalia
well,
the
states
could
--
could
fully
not
register
the
bonds.
the
only
consequences
would
be
tax
consequences
to
the
owners
of
the
bonds.
just
as
the
states
could
have
declined
to
adopt
the
55-mile
speed
limit,
and
the
only
consequence
would
have
been
their
loss
of
highway
funds.
justice
scalia
i'm
talking
about
the
degree
of
coercion,
that's
--
justice
scalia
--
that's
--
justice
scalia
you
can
coerce
them
but
not
effectively,
that's
the
principle.
justice
scalia
(inaudible)
strange
constitutional
principle,
is
it?
it's
okay
--
justice
scalia
--
to
apply
the
coercion
but
not
enough
to
be
effective.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
you
--
you
think
the
55-mile
speed
limit
requirement
would
have
been
bad
if
the
sanction
for
the
states
failure
to
observe
it
had
been
high
enough
--
justice
scalia
--
all
highway
funds
eliminated,
that
--
that
would
have
done
it.
