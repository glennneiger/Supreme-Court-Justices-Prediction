mr.
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
plaintiffs
in
the
amici
the
states,
national
governors'
association
raise
with
considerable
heat
and
i
believe
considerable
sincerity
important
constitutional
principles
of
federalism.
i
must
confess
to
a
certain
puzzlement
about
how
to
respond
to
those
concerns
in
this
case,
and
i
would
like
that
the
outset
to
suggest
a
kind
of
jurisprudential
framework
for
considering
those
concerns.
(inaudible)
as
my
touchstone
the
words
of
justice
frankfurter
in
his
--
in
his
separate
opinion
in
graves
against
new
york.
there,
justice
frankfurter
said,
"since
two
governments
have
authority
within
the
same
territory,
neither
through
its
power
to
tax
can
be
allowed
to
cripple
the
operation
of
the
other."
the
arguments
on
which
mcculloch
v.
maryland
rested
have
their
roots
in
actuality,
but
they
have
been
distorted
by
sterile
refinements
unrelated
to
affairs.
these
doctrines
have
until
recently
been
moving
in
the
realm
of
what
lincoln
called
pernicious
obstructions,
the
web
of
unreality
span
for
marshall's
famous
victim
was
brushed
away
by
one
stroke
of
mr.
justice
holmes
(inaudible),
the
power
to
tax
is
not
the
power
to
destroy
while
this
court
sits.
mr.
fried
that
is
a
very
serious
question.
it's
a
very
serious
question
which
this
court
although
it
has
in
the
gerhardt
case
and
in
the
graves
case
itself,
removed
the
theoretical
underpinning
of
the
pollock
doctrine
by
overruling
collector
against
them,
its
very
striking
that
in
case
after
case,
this
court
has
declined
to
draw
the
general
conclusion
which
you
refer
to.
mr.
fried
well,
if
i
may
answer
you
at
a
little
bit
of
length,
congress
has
declined
to
press
that
issue.
this
court
has
declined
to
press
that
issue
and
that
is
because
what
is
it
state
there
is
a
matter
of
great
sensitivity
to
the
states,
and
i
would
think
that
justice
--
this
court
has
been
circumspect
in
that
regard.
and
justice
--
congress
has
been
circumspect
in
that
regard
and
i
think
they
have
been
circumspect
in
this
very
legislation.
so,
if
you
would
permit
me,
i
would
like
to
be
circumspect
in
that
regard
and
not
pronounce
or
even
venture
a
position
of
the
government
on
something
which
everybody
has
sought
to
back
away
from
and
to
avoid
to
turning
--
mr.
fried
--
in
from
the
confrontation.
mr.
fried
i
suspect
there
very
well
maybe
a
constitutional
limit.
mr.
fried
i
think
it
would
rest
on
the
tenth
amendment,
i
think
it
would
rest
on
principles
of
federalism.
it
would
not
rest
on
the
theory
of
the
pollock
case
because
the
theory
of
the
pollock
case
was
the
theory
of
immunity
at
the
source
and
that
theory
has
been
specifically
repudiated
by
this
court
on
two
occasions.
so,
we
would
have
to
find
a
new
basis
and
i
would
think
it
would
be
rather
imprudent
of
me,
but
if
you
press
me,
i
shall
proceed
on
that
imprudent
course
to
try
to
device
extemporaneously
what
such
a
theory
might
be,
but
there
is
a
great
deal
--
mr.
fried
i
would
--
mr.
fried
it
is
a
concern
but
i
believe
that
a
concern
of
that
degree
of
seriousness
should
not
be
addressed
and
need
not
to
be
addressed
in
the
case,
but
what
is
at
stake
is
to
speak
frankly
utterly
trivial.
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
precipitate
this
court,
the
united
states
government
and
the
congress
into
a
confrontation
on
a
matter
of
the
highest
constitutional
moment
with
so
little
is
at
stake.
mr.
fried
no
because
there
is
no
occasion
to
do
so,
justice
blackmun.
with
great
respect
to
learned
counsel
from
south
carolina
and
the
governors'
association,
i
suggest
that
they
seek
to
move
us
away
from
arguments
having
their
roots
in
actuality
and
it
is
they
who
urge
on
us
instead
sterile
refinements
unrelated
to
affairs.
as
i've
indicated,
the
united
states
will
make
no
argument
today
which
opens
the
door
to
a
taxing
power
large
enough
to
cripple
the
operation
of
the
states
nor
which
invites
this
court
to
relax
its
vigilance,
less
the
power
to
tax
become
the
power
to
destroy.
but
if
we
are
going
to
avoid
sterile
obstructions,
we
must
get
somewhat
firmer
grasp
on
the
actualities,
on
what
really
is
at
stake
here
for
we
are
dealing
in
general
principles
about
federalism
and
not
in
taboos.
we're
not
even
talking
about
procedural
or
jurisdictional
requirements
and
these
general
principles,
unlike
for
instance,
the
axioms
of
mathematics
which
if
true
are
truth
of
the
last
decimal
place,
they
just
give
out
at
the
margins
as
was
recognized
in
the
fried
case,
principles
of
federalism
just
cannot
stand
the
pressure
of
extreme
emergencies.
i
would
suggest
that
also
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
where
practical
consequences
are
too
slight,
they
also
give
out
and
just
become
indeterminate.
let's
turn
for
a
moment
at
what
really
is
it
stake.
congress
had
no
hidden
agenda
in
this
case,
no
imperial
designs
on
state
autonomy.
on
the
contrary,
congress
was
demonstrating
a
perhaps
over
nice
delicacy
about
not
using
the
heaviest
weapons
in
its
arsenal.
its
concerns
were
that
bearer
bonds
of
all
issuers,
federal
issuers,
corporate
and
municipal
issuers
have
served
as
a
kind
of
interest
bearing
large
denomination
currency
for
tax
evaders
and
other
with
sources
of
wealth
do
not
bear
looking
into.
and
they
are
much
more
attractive
than
cashing
the
mattress
or
gold
bullion
in
the
safe
deposit
box.
and
municipals
are
particularly
unattractive
--
particularly
attractive
to
those
who
are
up
to
no
good
because
once
you
get
your
cash
into
the
safe
harbor,
there
is
no
longer
any
legal
obligation
to
pay
tax
on
the
interest
or
even
to
report
it
in
some
circumstances.
congress
might
simply
here
forbidden
the
transferring
or
holding
of
bearer
bonds.
instead,
they
chose
what
they
thought
was
a
less
intrusive
measure
for
corporate
and
municipals
with
the
thought
that
this
way,
they
would
force
these
holdings
out
into
the
open,
create
a
paper
record,
making
them
far
less
attractive
for
nefarious
practices.
mr.
fried
i
would
think
in
this
circumstance
if
that
was
your
premise,
you
would
still,
i
think,
not
have
cause
for
worry
because
as
the
special
master
found,
and
his
findings
are
entirely
consistent
with
the
intentions
of
congress.
the
special
master
found
that
this
form
of
tax
in
no
way,
in
no
way
burdened
the
ability
of
the
states
to
raise
revenues
through
borrowing
and
indeed,
in
no
way
affected
how
they
borrowed,
what
form
they
borrowed
except
in
that
holy
question
begging
sense
that,
of
course,
they
could
no
longer
borrow
in
bearer
form.
but
as
far
as
their
ability
to
enter
the
market,
the
terms
on
which
they
entered
the
market
whether
long-term
or
short-term,
and
what
interests
or
rates,
and
for
what
purposes
they
borrowed,
the
special
master
found
that
there
is
simply
had
no
effect
whatsoever.
and
that
being
so,
i
don't
see
why
these
--
mr.
fried
well,
i've
--
mr.
fried
there
are
other
ways
certainly,
but
the
--
it's
nothing
improper
about
these
means.
the
reason
there
is
nothing
improper
about
these
means,
even
on
your
premise
which
you
offer
on
a
hypothetical
basis
because
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity,
whatever
its
present
status
is
not
some
kind
of
a
taboo,
it's
a
principle
and
if
in
actuality,
the
ability
of
the
states
to
borrow
with
such
a
doctrine
is
intended
to
protect
is
in
no
way
affected,
then
surely
that
has
some
bearing
on
how
one
considers
the
matter.
mr.
fried
well
--
mr.
fried
i'm
taking
it
back
by
your
hypothetical.
i
must
admit
it,
it's
not
one
that
in
our
hours
of
preparation
that
occurred
to
us.
the
reason
that
i
answered
justice
o'connor
as
i
did
was
that
what
concerns
her
is
after
all
an
important
constitutional
principle
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
and
that
principle
is
a
principle
and
that
is
why
i
vouched
--
vouched
in
justice
frankfurter's
words
is
a
practical
principle
which
must
be
applied
in
a
practical
way
if
nothing
is
at
stake
and
that
is
the
case
here,
nothing
is
at
stake.
then,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
important
to
enter
into
the
sterile
refinement
of
whether
--
mr.
fried
nothing
is
at
stake
if
they
comply.
mr.
fried
well,
there
would
be
a
clear
eighth
amendment
problem
in
that
--
in
that
context
--
mr.
fried
(inaudible)
mr.
fried
when
one
considers
that
the
financial
burden
involved
here
is
practically
nil,
in
terms
of
the
transactions
clause,
even
for
an
a
small
as
a
million
dollars
which
in
terms
of
dollar
volume
is
less
than
1%
of
all
municipals,
although
in
terms
of
the
number
of
securities
issued,
it's
a
great
deal
larger
that
cost
of
the
state,
the
increase
cost
of
the
state,
is
$165
a
year
over
the
life
of
a
20-year
bond.
and
if
you
go
to
larger
denomination
borrowings,
it
is
cheaper
in
registered
form.
when
you
consider
the
interest
rate
differential,
i
think
that
has
been
more
or
less
abandoned
as
well
it
might
be
because
interest
rate
differentials
can
be
only
a
function
of
market
preference.
and
if
we
abstract
from
the
market
preference
of
tax
evaders,
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
a
market
preference
for
bearer
bonds.
registered
bonds
are
easier
to
deal
with,
they
are
more
secure
to
deal
with
and
in
any
event,
only
about
10%
to
12%
of
municipals
are
held
personally
by
individuals
in
any
event.
there
is
no
rational
basis
--
mr.
fried
well,
the
master
found
that
that
is
simply
custom
and
habit.
corporations
also
issued
their
bonds
in
bearer
form
and
being
somewhat
more
--
more
flexible
long
before
tefra,
they
have
moved
virtually,
universally
to
registered
form,
and
the
master
found,
i
think
quite
reasonably,
that
this
is
a
change
which
the
municipal
market
would
have
gone
to
of
its
own
in
any
event
except
for
the
slight
problem
of
the
very
great
facility
that
bearer
municipals
gave
to
people
were
up
to
no
good.
now,
turning
to
the
regulatory
burden,
i
find
that
a
puzzling
argument,
i
think
back
to
the
ferc
case
and
the
ferc
case
was
troublesome
because
there
what
happened
is
congress
was
dealing
with
what
in
terms
of
politics
and
policy
were
surely
a
hot
potato,
how
consumer
electric
rates
will
be
calculated
and
how
they're
going
to
be
allocated,
a
very
difficult
political
question,
and
congress
sought
to
involve,
if
not
to
enlist,
at
least
sought
to
involve
the
state
regulatory
mechanism
there,
and
that
was
said
to
be
all
right
although
not
everybody
on
this
court
so
believe.
in
this
case
by
contrast,
what
you
have
is
a
purely
technical
requirement.
there
is
no
political
or
policy
hot
potato
being
thrown
to
the
states
to
somehow
deal
within
their
own
political
boundary.
this
is
--
this
is
no
more
of
a
regulatory
burden,
then
if
the
congress
had
said
that
all
checks
issued
in
the
united
states
including
those
issued
by
states
must
have
a
certain
format
and
being
coded
in
a
particular
way.
and
indeed,
congress
long
ago
required
the
states
to
issue
w4s,
w2s
and
1099s
in
terms
of
reporting
to
the
irs
when
there
was
a
state
tax
refund.
these,
as
far
as
regulatory
burdens,
though
they
may
have
had
technical
difficulties
from
a
policy
and
a
political
point
of
view,
was
simply
trivial
and
that
is
why
i
think
we
are
dealing
at
a
level
of
triviality
which
makes
it
dangerous
for
this
court,
dangerous
to
allow
itself
to
be
drawn
into
what
our
really
serious
questions.
the
question
that
trouble
you
justice
o'connor
are
serious
questions
and
i
am
disturbed
that
this
court
should
be
precipitated
into
a
confrontation
with
those
difficult
questions
where
frankly
nothing
is
at
stake.
mr.
fried
it
does
indeed
to
withhold,
to
remit
and
to
send
w2s
and
w4s,
yes,
it
does.
and
presumably,
depending
on
the
structure
of
the
state
statutes
that
may
or
may
not
require
some
kind
of
adjust
--
mending,
including
perhaps
even
--
even
some
legislation.
but
this
is
not
legislation
such
as
we
had
in
ferc,
where
--
what
was
involved
was
the
--
the
state
political
machinery
coming
to
grips
with
a
difficult
political
choice.
i
think
there
is
less
at
stake
here
than
even
the
dignitary
interests
that
troubled
the
court
in
coyle
against
smith.
i
think
there
is
less
at
stake
here
than
if
congress
dictated
the
designation
of
a
state
flower.
there
is
simply
nothing
of
significance
at
stake
at
all
and
that
is
why
i
say
that
these
high
constitutional
principles
simply
like
electrons
which
escape
detection,
the
high
constitutional
principle
simply
become
indeterminant
when
they
are
deployed
against
this
problem.
if
there
are
no
further
question,
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
