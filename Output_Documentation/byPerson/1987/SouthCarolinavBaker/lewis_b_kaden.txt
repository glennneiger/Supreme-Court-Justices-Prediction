mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
national
governors'
association
does
not
think
it
necessary
to
reach
the
tax
immunity
issue
which
mr.
linton
argued.
but
rather,
we
submit
that
the
question
squarely
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
can
enlist
the
state
legislatures
to
its
service
in
order
to
achieve
a
national
goal.
that
principle,
the
principle
that
--
that
this
--
that
congress
may
not
so
enlist
the
state
legislature
has
survived
through
all
the
twists
and
turns
of
federalism
jurisdiction
--
jurist
prudence
in
this
court
and
has
been
most
recently
reaffirmed
in
the
case
of
ferc
versus
mississippi.
the
principle
is
a
simple
one.
whatever
else
congress
may
do
pursuant
to
the
delegated
powers,
it
may
not
reach
out
into
the
circle
of
authority
reserved
to
the
states
and
conscript
the
state
legislative
machinery
and
put
it
to
use
to
advance
a
national
goal.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
yes,
indeed.
when
congress
in
this
case
said
to
the
states,
“you
must
register
your
bonds
by
december
31,
1982.”
the
consequence
of
that
was
that
each
state
had
to
adjust
the
agenda
of
its
legislative
and
regulatory
bodies
in
order
to
accommodate
its
laws
to
this
new
requirement
and
the
record
shows,
for
example,
that
in
kansas,
47
statutes
had
to
be
amended.
in
illinois,
the
question
of
adjustment
of
their
statutes
to
the
registration
requirement
had
to
be
put
on
special
agenda
of
the
legislature,
and
then
the
legislature
had
to
come
back
to
make
a
further
adjustment.
and
in
new
jersey
--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
yes,
but
as
the
--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
this
--
this
was
no
condition
that
gave
the
states
an
option
as
this
court
found
in
the
south
dakota
case
to
comply
or
not.
this
statute
indicates
from
the
legislative
history
through
the
stipulation
of
the
parties
through
the
master's
report
that
this
was
a
requirement
that
the
states
register
their
bonds.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i
think
the
difference
in
the
measure
of
coercion
is
significant
here.
in
south
dakota
--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
that's
right.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
that
rights,
and
--
and
that
coercion
is
reflected
as
i
indicate
and
the
fact
that
the
legislative
history
indicates,
no
intent
to
raise
money
and
no
effect
of
raising
revenue.
the
combination
of
those
two
as
this
court
said
in
--
in
(inaudible),
means
it's
not
a
tax.
further,
and
pursuant
to
that
congressional
finding,
the
party
stipulated
before
the
trial
that
this
was
a
requirement
and
the
master
so
found
and
the
solicitor
general
agrees
that
that's
the
better
way
to
--
to
view
it.
now,
in
viewing
it
as
a
requirement
--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
yes,
sir.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no,
i
think
far
from
it,
the
penalty
in
the
south
dakota
case,
if
i
remember
correctly,
was
5%
of
available
highway
funds.
here,
the
increase
in
cost
if
the
states
fail
to
register
and
issue
taxable
bonds
--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--
would
be
28
to
32%
of
their
total
borrowing
cost,
billions
of
dollars
a
year.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
exactly.
the
economic
cost
of
compliance
was
trivial.
but
the
economic
effect
of
the
sanction
was
enormous
and
the
coercive
effect
comes
from
that.
but
in
addition
to
the
coercive
effect,
you
have
the
congressional
finding
and
the
stipulation.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
here,
the
effect
was
complete.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i
don't
think
so.
here,
the
coercion
was
completely
effective.
no
state
has
issued
registered
bond
--
non-registered
bonds
since
the
effective
date
of
the
statute.
and
if
you
--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
you
don't
have
the
compulsion
to
pass
laws.
in
circumstances
where
the
state
has
attached
the
condition
to
standing
--
spending
power
as
this
court
has
found,
you
have
a
realistic
option
not
to
participate.
here,
if
you
accept
the
stipulation
that
this
was
a
requirement,
you
also
have
the
compulsion
to
pass
laws
and
it
is
the
nature
of
that
intrusion,
not
its
weight,
not
the
economic
effects
but
the
nature
of
the
requirement
that
that
legislature
in
illinois
convened
itself,
adjust
its
agenda
and
pass
these
laws
that
gives
rise
to
the
constitutional
infirmity.
that
is
a
very
different
question
than
using
the
constitution
as
a
shield
from
a
generally
applicable
regulation
such
as
it
was
that
issue
in
garcia.
there
is
all
the
world
of
difference
between
telling
the
state
that
it
must
pay
a
minimum
wage
to
its
employees,
the
same
as
general
motors
must
do
it,
and
telling
the
state
that
it
must
get
its
legislature
in
session
and
create
its
own
labor
standards
board
modeled
after
the
federal
design
to
perform
that
regulatory
function
that
congress
prescribed.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i
think
that
provides
an
option
and
what
is
otherwise
a
generally
applicable
regulation.
what
eeoc
did
was
said
to
the
states
that
they
must
apply
the
same
anti-discrimination
provisions
with
respect
to
the
elderly
that
a
private
individual
did.
quite
different
that
saying
to
the
states
--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
exactly,
which
is
analogous
to
the
saying
in
the
hodel
case
that
if
the
state
chooses
to
set
up
a
regulatory
machinery
for
service
mining,
it
can
play
that
role,
otherwise,
it
will
be
preempted
and
fall
under
the
federal
regulatory
machinery.
again,
i
would
suggest
quite
different
from
the
command
to
the
state
to
use
its
resources
in
service
of
the
--
of
federal
goal.
this
maybe
a
small
kind
of
intrusion,
but
in
nature,
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
troubles
the
states
about
the
protection
that
forwarded
their
federalism.
the
congress
may
from
time
to
time
narrow
the
circle
of
authority
reserved
to
the
states,
but
it
is
quite
another
matter
as
justice
blackmun
recognized
in
the
--
in
the
beginning
of
his
opinion
in
ferc
versus
mississippi
to
reach
into
the
remaining
circle
and
enlist
the
state
apparatus
in
the
service
of
the
federal
cost.
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
power
of
choice
of
the
ability
to
set
a
political
agenda
that
is
so
crucial
to
state
autonomy.
we
know
that
state
autonomy
won't
be
eliminated
in
one
large
swoop.
the
court
has
not
had
to
confront
the
case
where
congress
tells
the
state
legislature
to
have
only
50
members
or
meet
every
december
or
choose
its
--
the
members
of
its
supreme
court
according
to
federal
design.
but
what
the
congress
does
with
increasing
frequency
is
achieve
its
regulatory
goals
by
reaching
over
and
having
the
state
do
it.
that
was
the
issue,
for
example,
in
epa
versus
brown
where
the
federal
government
set
environmental
standards,
but
until
they
retreated
and
the
case
was
mooted
in
1977,
the
device
of
enforcing
those
regulatory
objectives
was
through
the
states.
and
that's
what
caused
the
lower
--
the
circuit
courts
to
consider
that
to
find
an
invasion
of
the
tenth
amendment
autonomy
interest.
and
similarly
in
ferc,
ultimately
the
court
narrowly
divided
on
whether
the
intrusion
was
too
much,
but
there,
it
wasn't
the
legislative
apparatus
that
was
being
commandeered.
it
was
a
quasi-adjudicative
body,
just
being
ask
to
consider
the
federal
standards,
giving
the
option
of
getting
out
of
the
field
of
regulating
those
utility
rates
entirely.
and
here,
many
people
have
had
the
reaction,
well,
why
are
the
governors
and
the
mayors
and
the
counties
and
the
state
legislatures
bringing
this
particular
case
before
this
court
occupying
this
master
for
two
or
three
years,
when
it
seems
so
inconsequential,
but
the
fact
is,
as
i
indicated,
never
is
the
court's
sanction
a
compulsion
to
the
state
to
pass
laws.
and
yet
in
this
case,
it
is
precisely
what
the
legislatures
as
this
record
unequivocally
shows
of
kansas
--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--jurisdiction.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
well,
he
doesn't
really
argue
that
with
any
conviction.
in
fact
at
page
39
of
his
brief,
he
concedes
that
looking
at
this
as
a
registration
requirement
is
really
the
better
way
to
--
to
do
it.
he
will
take
advantage
of
the
--
of
the
conditional
approach
if
need
be
and
he
goes
on
to
argue
the
tax
immunity
issue
because
if
it
is
conditional,
then
you'll
have
to
consider
the
sanction.
but
when
you
look
at
what
congress
did
and
what
congress
said,
there
was
no
option
being
conveyed,
the
option
was
simply
the
technique,
they
meant
to
require
registration,
the
party
so
stipulated
and
the
master
so
found
was
on
page
2
and
then
the
first
sentence
of
his
conclusion.
it's
the
right
way
to
look
at
it
and
it
leaves
--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--
the
community
issue.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
yes,
indeed.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
yes,
indeed.
congress
if
it
had
in
mind
curving
tax
evasion
by
creating
a
record
of
ownership
of
municipal
bonds
could
ever
require
that
those
bonds
be
sold
or
bought
through
brokers.
brokers
file
information
returns,
they
know
the
amounts
of
those
trades
and
that
kind
of
regulation
would
not
have
implicated
the
states
at
all.
the
states
would
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
they
could
have
told
the
holders
of
those
bonds
in
the
secondary
market
that
when
you
seek
to
buy
or
sell
those
bonds,
go
to
a
broker
and
the
broker
will
file
an
information
return
with
the
federal
government
and
indeed,
that
would
have
been
a
more
effective.
we're
not
arguing
that
the
method
adopted
was
ineffective,
but
that
would've
been
more
effective
than
the
device
of
requiring
registration
because,
in
fact
as
you
know,
transfer
agents
don't
file
those
information
returns.
you
can
negotiate
a
registered
bond
transferring
beneficial
ownership
without
going
through
a
transfer
agent,
and
so
the
registration
system
doesn't
really
worked
very
well
to
curve
tax
compliance,
but
that's
not
the
just
of
our
argument.
given
that
alternative
means
of
protecting
the
tax
compliance
interest
which
certainly
the
governors
and
the
mayor
share
with
the
national
government
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
commandeer
the
legislative
apparatus
of
the
states
was
unnecessary
and
contrary
to
something
that
is
very
deeply
held
in
the
structure
of
federalism
established
under
the
constitution.
chief
justice
--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
if
--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no,
it
would
have
depended
on
a
finding
by
a
fact
finder
of
whether
it
was
coercive,
that's
the
test
that
court
established
in
stewart
and
reaffirmed
in
--
in
south
dakota.
chief
justice
marshall
said
long
ago
in
the
mcculloch
case,
that
not
only
must
the
end
of
what
congress
does
be
legitimate,
but
the
means
must
be
appropriate
and
consistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
constitution,
and
what
has
happened
here
in
this
relatively
insignificant
little
matter
of
registering
municipal
bonds
is
that
congress
has
adopted
a
technique
that
amounts
for
the
first
time
to
commending
the
state
legislature
to
adjust
its
agenda
to
suit
the
federal
regulatory
purpose.
that
gives
rise
to
the
constitutional
infirmity
that
we
assert.
thank
you.
