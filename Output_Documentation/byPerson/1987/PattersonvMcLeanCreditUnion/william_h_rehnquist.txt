chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
87-107,
brenda
patterson
versus
mclean
credit
union.
ms.
hair,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
that's
crystal
clear,
ms.
hair,
that
the
consequences
like
you're
talking
about,
bad
as
they
may
be,
necessarily
implicate
the
right
to
make
or
enforce
a
contract.
that
certainly
isn't
an
inclusive
term.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing,
ms.
hair,
that
an
employer
hires
a
black
person
for
$50,000
and
the
black
person
later
comes
in
and
says,
well,
if
i'd
been
white,
they
would
have
paid
me
$55,000,
so
they
violated
1981.
do
you
think
if
the
black
employee
can
prove
that,
that's
a
cause
of
action
under
1981?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
1981
really
covers
everything
that
title
vii
does?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
would
be
protected
by
title
vii,
wouldn't
she?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
perfectly
true
but
the
fact
that
title
vii
covers
a
lot
of
this
perhaps
would
suggest
to
us
that
we
not
strain
to
develop
an
independent
body
of
federal
contract
law
governing
the
terms
of
contracts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
hair.
mr.
davis,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we're
really
here
to
decide
this
case
for
ourselves.
perhaps
understanding
the
lower
court
cases
may
be
helpful
in
that
regard,
but
you
know,
the
reason
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
was
presumably
to
render
a
decision
of
this
court,
rather
than
to
adopt
lower
court
cases.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
arguing
now
about
the
instruction,
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
your
client,
the
credit
union,
promoted
exclusively
by
seniority
and
wasn't
particularly
interested
in
qualifications,
just
whoever
had
been
in
line
longest
would
be
enabled
to
have
the
promotion.
now,
an
instruction
like
this
wouldn't
be
warranted
in
that
case,
would
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
was
it
conceded
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
qualification
or
performance
was
the
only
standard
for
a
promotion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
was
there
any
evidence
introduced
by
the
petitioner
indicating
that
performance
and
qualification
was
not
the
only
criterion
for
promotion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
davis.
ms.
hair,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
hair.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-107,
brenda
patterson
v.
mclean
credit
union.
mr.
chambers,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
fee-setting,
mr.
chambers...
you
would
still
have
been
able
to
recover
against
public
bodies
in
a
suit
under
1981,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kaplan.
mr.
chambers,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
chambers,
certainly
this
is
an
extension
of
runyon
in
the
sense
that
in
runyon
you're
dealing
with
a
one-shot
deal:
a
black
person
is
turned
down
for
enrollment
at
a
private
school.
here
it's
not
a
question
of
a
refusal
to
hire
a
person;
it's
a
question
of
the
way
the
person
is
treated
after
they're
hired.
it's
a
regular
employment
code
that
you're
asking--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--a
black
person
trying
to
get
a
job
fits
much
more
readily
under
the
terms
of
make
and
enforce
a
contract
than
a
black
person
complaining
of
harassment
on
the
job.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
1981
doesn't
say
the
right
to
work
and
make
a
living.
it
says
the
right
to
make
and
enforce
contracts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
chambers.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
