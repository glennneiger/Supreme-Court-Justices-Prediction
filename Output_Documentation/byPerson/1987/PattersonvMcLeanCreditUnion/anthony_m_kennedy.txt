justice
kennedy
i
don't
understand
why
that
follows
from
the
solicitor's
position.
you
were
saying
that
if
a
state
has
a
law
that
impacts
explicitly
on
racial
minorities
that
this
law
can
be
incorporated
into
the
contract
without
violating
1981?
justice
kennedy
well,
there's
a
difference,
isn't
there,
between
state
laws
that
differentially
impact
on
racial
minorities
and
those
that
are
neutral.
the
covenant
of
good
faith
is
a
neutral
term.
justice
kennedy
suppose
this
case.
an
employer
hires
a
person
from
a
racial
minority
on
absolutely
equal
conditions.
then
a
supervisor
comes
in
here
for
30
days
and
causes
great
humiliation
and
degradation.
the
employer
then
fires
the
supervisor.
cause
of
action
under
1981?
justice
kennedy
assume
a
high
level
supervisor
who
had
general
authority
to
act
this
way,
although
without
the
employer's
actual
knowledge.
justice
kennedy
so
what's
the
standard,
egregious
conduct?
justice
kennedy
well,
we
know.
we
know
that
white
persons
were
not
subjected
to
this
indignity
and
black
persons
were.
we
know.
that's
stipulated
in
the
hypothetical.
justice
kennedy
so
your
answer
is,
there
is
a
cause
of
action
in
the
hypothetical?
justice
kennedy
well,
is
it
your
position
that
once
the
contract
is
made,
there
is
no
conduct
of
the
employer
that's
so
onerous
that
it's
not
actionable
under
1981
if
it's
racially
motivated?
justice
kennedy
well,
assume
that
a
contract
is
made
in
good
faith
and
in
non-discriminatory
terms,
but
once
its
performance
begins,
highly
onerous
conditions
are
imposed.
are
there
no
conditions
that
are
so
onerous
that
1981
would
not
be
implicated?
justice
kennedy
it
has
to
be
promotion
or
termination?
justice
kennedy
there
are
standard
doctrines
in
contracts
of
frustration
of
purpose,
are
there
not?
justice
kennedy
if
the
employment
contract
becomes
frustrated
of
its
purpose
by
reason
of
racial
discrimination,
is
1981
applicable?
justice
kennedy
why?
justice
kennedy
because
that
is
the
denial
of
the
right
to
make
a
contract
or
to
enforce
it?
justice
kennedy
you
agree
with
the
sg
in
this
case,
then?
justice
kennedy
well,
what's
the
difference
between
you
on
this
point?
justice
kennedy
but
it's
just
a
disagreement
among
you
as
to
how
his
standard
applies
to
the
facts
of
this
case?
justice
kennedy
counsel,
in
this
phase
of
the
argument
where
we
are
talking
about
stare
decisis,
i
take
it
we
assume
arguendo
the
premise
that
you
disagree
with,
that
the
case
was
wrongly
decided
in
the
first
instance.
you
disagree
with
that,
but
that's
part
of
the
premise
for
the
stare
decisis
argument.
justice
kennedy
i
know
you
do,
and
i
think
that
that's
a
very
arguable
point
and
there's
a
lot
of
merit
to
that
position.
but
in
this
phase
of
the
argument,
we're
assuming
the
case
is
wrongly
decided,
yet
we
should
retain
it
in
any
event.
isn't
that
the
point?
justice
kennedy
well,
it
didn't
change...
it
didn't
change
the
word
"right".
it
didn't
say
that
private
persons
can
recover.
and
the
president,
when
he
signed
the
bill,
did
not
necessarily
endorse
the
legislative
history.
justice
kennedy
so,
i
think
that's...
i
think
you
make
a
legitimate
argument.
i
do
not
think
it's
conclusive.
justice
kennedy
i
recognize
that,
but
i'm
asking
you
if
we're
not
assuming
that
even
if
we
have
questions
about
runyon,
that
we
should
retain
it
for
reasons
of
stare
decisis.
isn't
that
the
first
prong
of
your
argument?
justice
kennedy
are
you
aware
of
any
precedent
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
in
which
we
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
a
statute
which
creates
a
right
has
been
wrongly
construed
and
yet
we
continue
that
precedent
on
the
books?
justice
kennedy
of
course,
the
flood
case
was
isolated
to
baseball.
baseball
is
not
part
of
interstate
commerce
and
antitrust.
we
did
not
use
it
in
order
to
create
further
rights.
and
that's
my
point.
do
you
have
any
precedent
to
show
us
that
a
case
which
is
arguably
wrongly
construed
should
remain
the
seminal
case
for
the
enforcement
and
the
interpretation
of
the
statute?
do
you
have
any
precedent
for
that?
justice
kennedy
do
you
find
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
words
of
the
statute
any
controlling
principle
or
guidance
that
we
can
have
for
the
decision
of
these
cases?
suppose
that
a
supervisor
calls
an
employee...
has
a
fit
of
temper
and
calls
an
employee
a
name
that's
a
racial
epithet.
is
that
actionable?
justice
kennedy
what's
the
controlling
principle
that
we
look
to
to
decide
that
kind
of
issue?
we
could
have
all
sorts
of
hypotheticals
ranging
from
an
isolated
incident
to
a
pattern
of
conduct
to
constructive
discharge.
what
do
we
look
to
when
we're
trying
to
make
up...
when
we're
trying
to
conclude
what
the
answer
should
be
in
these
cases
given
congress'
filing
of
the
amicus
brief
that
they
don't
want
to
have
the
problem?
justice
kennedy
so,
anything
that
title
vii
covers
is
not
covered
by
1981?
justice
kennedy
so,
title
vii
and
1981
are
coextensive?
justice
kennedy
so,
in
order
to
see
what
1981
covers,
we
just
look
to
title
vii?
justice
kennedy
we
have
a
difficulty
in
this
case,
counsel.
justice
kennedy
so,
my
racial
epithet
example.
what
result?
justice
kennedy
my
racial
epithet
example.
what
result?
the
supervisor
does
this
with
some
regularity.
justice
kennedy
but
you
haven't
yet
mentioned
one
of
the
words
of
1981.
so,
the
statutory
words
give
us
no
guidance
i
take
it?
justice
kennedy
one
more
question
on
this,
counsel,
and
then
i'll
let
you
proceed.
i
assume
that
the
answer
would
be
the
same
in
1866.
when
congress
passed
the
statute
in
1866,
it
thought
that
it
was
forbidding
the
use
of
racial
epithets
in
the
work
place?
justice
kennedy
or
is
this
an
evolving
standard?
justice
kennedy
and
do
we
measure
those
egregious
standards
by
the
changing
standards
of
society?
justice
kennedy
and
if
that
doesn't
take
place,
does
the
statute
acquire
any
new
meaning
on
its
own
terms?
let
me
put
you
this
case.
suppose
in
1868
the
only
grocery
store
in
a
small
town
refused
to
sell
groceries
to
blacks.
coverage
under
the
statute?
justice
kennedy
and
if
this
persists
for
20
years,
and
the
state
does
nothing
to
correct
it,
still
no
coverage
under
the
statute?
justice
kennedy
and
congress...
you
find
no
historical
evidence
that
congress
was
concerned
about
this?
justice
kennedy
we've
all
read
the
legislative
history.
justice
kennedy
and
really
there
is
a
brief
that
can
be
made
for
both
sides,
isn't
that
true?
