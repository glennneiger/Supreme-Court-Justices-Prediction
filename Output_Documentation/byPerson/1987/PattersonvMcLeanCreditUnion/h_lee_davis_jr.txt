mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
first
opportunity
that
i'm
aware
of
for
the
court
to
differentiate
between
the
rights
available
under
title
vii
as
opposed
to
the
rights
available
under
section
1981.
the
petitioner's
case
in
the
first
instance
is
a
case
of
adverse
working
conditions
and
she
bases
that
case
of
adverse
working
conditions
on
several
pieces
of
evidence
of
discrete
acts.
that
is
that
the
president
of
the
credit
union
stared
at
her,
that
he
criticized
her
work,
that
he
made
two
discrete
racial
remarks,
one
in
1972
and
one
in
1976.
her
allegations
of
excessive
work
load.
the
question
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
these
acts
of
alleged
racial
harassment
standing
alone
present
a
cognizable
claim
under
section
1981.
i
believe
that
it's
obvious
that
the
terms
conditions
and
privileges
of
employment
language
which
is
in
title
vii
would
cover
alleged
racial
harassment,
adverse
working
conditions.
the
language
in
section
1981,
however,
is
a
different
kind
of
language.
the
language
there
is
to
make
and
enforce
contracts.
and
i
believe
that
they're
two
different
things,
so
i
hope
that
this
court
will
take
the
opportunity
to
define
and
differentiate
the
various
rights
available
under
each
of
the
two
statutes.
part
of
the
problem
in
understanding
what
rights
are
available
in
the
statutes
is
the
fact
that
many
of
the
lower
courts
have
used
the
term,
discrimination,
synonymous
with
various
things.
as
you
read
the
cases,
you'll
find
that
discrimination
sometimes
means
racial
harassment.
sometimes
discrimination
means
adverse
working
conditions.
sometimes
discrimination
means
disparate
treatment
in
hiring,
firing,
promotion,
wage
discrimination.
in
this
case,
we're
dealing
with
discrimination
as
it
means
abusive
working
environment,
hostile
working
environment--
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
--why
would
any
plaintiff
or
why
would
this
plaintiff?
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
suppose,
justice
o'connor,
the
reason--
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
--well,
she
received
her
right
to
sue
letter
in
this
case
and
had
the
opportunity
to
bring
her
title
vii
in
this
action.
i
presume
the
reason
to
try
to
pursue
a
section
1981
claim
would
be
the
opportunity
for
greater
monetary
reward
with
compensatory
damages
and
punitive
damages
available.
that
would
be
my
assumption
as
to
why
a
plaintiff
would
attempt
to
pursue
a
claim
under
section
1981.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
think
any
conduct
of
the
employer
which
is
racially
motivated
which
impacts
on
the
right
to
make
and
enforce
contracts
is
actionable.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
don't
think
there
are
a
separate
and
independent
issue.
now,
if
those
onerous
oppressive
opprobrious
conditions,
excessive
hostile
working
environment
conditions
impact
on
a
promotion
decision,
impact
on
a
termination
decision.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
well,
the
fourth
circuit
limited
that
somewhat.
i'm
not
sure,
justice
kennedy,
that
it
wouldn't
also
impact,
if
it
impacted
on
a
wage
discrimination
case,
i
think
that
the
economic
impact
there
may
be
sufficient
to
come
under
section
1981.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
yes,
there
are.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
don't
think
a
constructive
discharge
case
is
actionable,
if
that's
what
you're
getting
to.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
excuse
me.
a
constructive
discharge
case
would
be
actionable
if
the
employee
terminated.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
enforce
the
contract,
because
the
level
of
opprobrious
conduct
became
so
great,
if
the
evidence
supports
that,
that
the
employee
could
no
longer
continue
the
employment.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
if
that
is
correct
and
if
that
is
true,
then
i
believe
that
an
employee
would
have
a
cause
of
action
in
state
court.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
there
was
no
claim
for
relief.
there
was
a
claim
for
relief
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
a
pendant
state
claim.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
is
a
cause
of
action
for
a
breach
of
the
contract
of
fair
dealing.
now,
whether
such
a
case
has
been
found
cognizable
for
racial
conduct,
for
hostile
working
environment
of
racial
conduct,
i
don't
know
of
any
north
carolina
case
that
would
uphold
that.
but
i
know
of
no
reason
why
they
shouldn't
if
it
in
fact
meets
the
elements
of
that
cause
of
action
under
north
carolina
law.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
think
it
if
causes
a
termination,
yes,
sir,
that
would
then
be
a
constructive
discharge
case
which
would
be
cognizable
under
section
1981,
the
right
to
enforce
the
contract.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
believe
the
lower
courts
have
held,
i
believe
there
are
decisions
which
allow
you
to
bring
a
constructive
discharge
case
under
section
1981
which
i
think
is
the
question
that
you've
asked
me.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
believe
that
what
section
1981
grants
is
the
competence
and
the
capacity
to
take
your
case
to
court.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
believe
you
have
the
right
to
enforce
your
contract.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
because--
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
--i
think
the
cases
have
held
that
a
constructive
discharge
where
the
employee
has
been
forced
to
resign
then
therefore
they
no
longer
have
the
opportunity
to
enforce
their
contract.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
well,
maybe
i'm
having
difficulty--
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
--i
suppose
so
in
that
definition.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
no,
i
don't.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
well,
i
don't
agree
with
sg
as
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
don't
agree
that
there
was
a
cause
of
action
which
existed
for
frustration
of
the
contract
under
these
facts.
i
have
no
problem
with
the
petitioner
in
this
case
bringing
a
state
action
for
breach
of
the
implied
warranty
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
believe,
justice
scalia,
the
line
of
lower
court
decisions
hold
that
termination
or
quitting
is
an
element
of
constructive
discharge.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
don't
know
of
any
cases,
justice
stevens,
holding
that.
part
of
the
problem
in
understanding
the
lower
court
cases
is
the
language.
discrimination
has
been
intermingled
so
much
in
title
vii
and
section
1981
cases.
often
times,
the
plaintiff--
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
section
1981
primarily
grants
competence
and
capacity
to
make
and
enforce
the
contracts.
title
vii
grants
a
cause
of
action
for
racial
harassment,
for
hostile
working
environment,
and
it
is
under
that
section
that
this
plaintiff,
this
petitioner
could
have
brought
her
claim.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
if
he
puts
a
condition--
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
--i
think
that's
in
the
making
of
the
contract.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
think
that's
a
condition
attached,
a
racial
harassment
which
impacts
the
making
of
the
contract.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
because
in
this
case,
the
allegations
were
not
part
of
the
contract.
they
were
conduct,
hostile
working
environment.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
it's
a
title
vii
claim,
it's
not
a
section
1981
claim.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
with
regard
to
the
harassment
claim,
i'd
like
to
go
into
the
promotion
claim
briefly.
the
petitioner
has
written
a
magnificent
brief
concerning
all
of
the
ways
that
you
can
support
your
claim
for
punishing
discrimination,
none
of
which
are
applicable
to
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
came
into
court
and
said
three
years
ago,
this
company
gave
a
promotion
to
somebody
else
who
was
working
in
an
entirely
different
job
responsibility,
had
entirely
different
functions
and
you
promoted
her
from
account
junior
to
account
intermediate.
and
i
should
have
had
that
job.
faced
with
that
evidence,
the
articulated
reason
for
giving
that
promotion
was
well,
this
lady's
been
performing
her
job
satisfactorily
and
we
gave
her
a
pay
increase.
and
we
gave
her
an
upgrade
in
job
description
and
job
scale
pay
scale
and
gave
her
a
pay
increase.
under
the
mcdonnell-douglas
proof
scheme,
after
the
court
had
indicated
that
the
prima
facie
case
had
been
met,
that
was
our
responsibility,
that
was
our
burden
of
persuasion.
the
petitioner--
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
and
the
correct
law
with
regard
to
the
burden
or
the
burden
of
proof
of
the
petitioner
after
we
have
articulated
a
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
our
decision,
our
nondiscriminatory
reason
being,
number
one,
the
petitioner
was
not
qualified
for
this
job.
she
was
a
clerk,
a
file
clerk.
this
was
an
accountant
bookkeeper
position.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
it
would.
but
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
that
seniority,
education
or
any
other
thing
was
a
criteria
in
this
particular
promotion.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
petitioner
conceded
anything
in
this
case.
this
lady
was
in
the
job,
sitting
at
a
desk
doing
the
job.
one
day
she
was
an
account
junior,
next
day
she
was
an
account
intermediate
and
had
a
raise.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
no
evidence
whatsoever.
after
the
respondent,
the
credit
union,
had
articulated
this
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
their
decision,
that
is,
the
qualifications
of
the
lady
doing
the
job,
the
petitioner
offered
no
further
evidence,
but
simply
relied
on
these
various
allegations
of
this
ten
year
course
of
conduct
of
hostile
working
conditions
to
say
that
the
decision
by
the
credit
union
was
racially
motivated.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
suppose.
although
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
the
various
ways
which
the
petitioner
says
that
you
can
prove
pretext--
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
--because
i
believe,
justice
white,
that
under
these
facts,
there
was
no
evidence
of
anything
other
than
qualifications
upon
which--
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
--the
instruction
was
that
in
order
for
the
petitioner
to
prevail,
she
must
show
that
she
was
more
qualified
than
the
lady
who
received
the
promotion.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
in
the
first
instance,
she
wasn't
qualified
and
in
the
second
instance,
her
qualifications
did
not
meet
the
qualifications
of
the
lady
who
had
the
job.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
after
we
had
met
our
burden
of
persuasion
of
showing
that
relative
qualifications
were
the
reason
for
our
decision,
i
believe
under
burdine,
if
we
have
the
right
to
choose
between
equally
qualified
candidates,
then
it
then
is
her
burden
to
show
that
she
is
more
qualified.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
the
right
to
choose
between
equally
qualified
candidates
absent
any
evidence
of
any
other
illegal
motive.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
suppose
under
that
then
she
would
have
a
jury
issue
as
to--
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
--no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
it
is,
because
there's
no
evidence
that
race
was
a
factor.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
permissible.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
the
instruction
says
that.
i
think
what
the
instruction
says
is,
to
the
jury,
if
you
find
the
decision
was
based
on
race--
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
--and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
evidence
which
we
presented
in
rebuttal
of
the
prima
facie
case
was
that
qualifications
were
the
reason,
and
the
petitioner
offered
no
evidence
to
rebut
that
to
show
that,
no,
the
decision
was
based
on
race.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
agree
this
case
should
never
have
gone
to
the
jury
on
that
issue.
it
went
to
the
jury,
i
think,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
where
the
only
evidence
for
the
decision
was
promotion.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
unfortunately,
the
trial
judge
opted
to
present
the
case
to
the
jury.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
justice
marshall,
i
dare
say
that
there
are
a
few
of
us
in
the
world
who
have
not
had
a
prejudice
thought
or
made
a
prejudice
comment
whether
the
prejudice
may
be
racial,
sexual
or
religious
or
some
other
basis.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
you
ignore
it.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
believe,
judge,
that
just
because...
and
that
statement
by
the
way
was
contradicted.
that
wasn't
given.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
taking
one
piece
of
evidence
made
in
1976
made
in
1976.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
was
sufficient,
your
honor,
to
allow
a
submission
of
this
issue.
i
don't
think
that
piece
of
evidence
is
sufficient
to
say
that
this
decision,
this
promotion
decision
was
based
on
a
racially
discriminatory,
made
in
a
racially
discriminatory
context.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
in
this
case?
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
that
this
girl
was
sitting
in
this
desk
doing
this
job.
there
was
no
job
opening.
there
was
no
position
available.
the
lady
was
a
bookkeeper
accountant.
she
received
an
increase
in
pay
grade.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
they
changed
her
title
is
what
they
did.
she
was
doing
the
same
job.
she
didn't
change
her
job
responsibilities.
they
changed
her
title
from
account
junior
to
account
intermediate.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
well,
they
had
two
or
three
people
in
the
bookkeeping
accounting
department
doing
bookkeeping
accounting
functions,
much
like
having
three
lawyers
in
a
law
office
who
are
associates,
and
one
day
you
promote
one
to
partner
and
you
still
have
two
associates.
they
didn't
create
a
new
position.
they
didn't
create
a
new
job
or
a
new
job
title...
they
did
create
a
new
job
title
but
no
new
position,
no
new
job
opening.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
did
anything
with
regard
to
those
statements?
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
no,
sir,
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
no,
sir,
there's
no
evidence
that
she
brought
it
to
anybody's
attention.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
it's
uncontradicted.
i
think
he
denied
it.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
sir,
i
don't
know
that.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
to
my
knowledge,
he
contradicted
those
statements.
mr.
h.
lee
davis,
jr.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
