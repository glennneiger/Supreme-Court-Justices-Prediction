ms.
penda
d.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
seek
reversal
of
two
rulings
concerning
the
scope
and
application
of
title
42
united
states
code
section
1981.
section
1981
guarantees
to
all
persons
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
the
same
right
to
make
and
enforce
contracts
as
is
enjoyed
by
white
citizens.
the
first
issue
presented
is
whether
an
employer
that
intentionally
subjects
a
black
worker
on
account
of
her
race
to
onerous
and
discriminatory
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
violates
section
1981.
the
second
issue
is
whether
a
black
employee
who
establishes
that
she
was
denied
a
promotion
because
of
her
race
must
additionally
affirmatively
prove
that
she
was
more
qualified
than
the
white
worker
who
received
the
promotion
in
order
to
hold
her
employer
liable
for
promotion
discrimination
under
section
1981.
in
this
case,
unlike
many
cases
of
employment
discrimination,
the
plaintiff
presented
extensive
direct
evidence
that
her
employer
engaged
in
blatant
intentional
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
according
to
the
evidence,
the
president
and
general
manager
of
mclean
credit
union
stated
that
black
workers
are
slower
by
nature
than
white
workers.
and
he
stated
that
he
did
not
want
to
hire
a
black
worker
because
they
cause
problems.
and
there
were
numerous
instances
of
racial
remarks
and
race-based
conduct
that
were
introduced
into
the
record
including
an
admission
by
one
of
the
company
witnesses
that
policy
of
the
president
was
not
to
hire
black
workers.
brenda
patterson
was
at
first
the
only
black
worker
at
mclean
credit
union
and
later
one
of
only
two
black
workers
and
she
was
the
victim
of
racial
discrimination
during
her
ten
years
of
employment
under
the
management
of
the
president
and
general
manager,
robert
stevenson.
patterson
filed
suit
charging
the
credit
union
with
intentional
discrimination
in
the
terms
and
conditions
of
her
employment
and
with
promotion
discrimination.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
claim
of
discrimination
in
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
fourth
circuit
concluded
that
section
1981
prohibits
discrimination
only
with
respect
to
hiring,
firing
and
promotion.
on
the
promotion
claim,
the
district
court
instructed
the
jury
that
the
plaintiff
had
the
burden
of
proving
both
that
she
was
denied
the
promotion
because
of
her
race,
and
that
she
was
more
qualified
than
the
white
employee
who
received
the
promotion.
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
this
jury
instruction.
with
regard
to
the
scope
of
section
1981,
under
the
rule
of
law
adopted
by
the
fourth
circuit,
protection
under
section
1981
is
afforded
only
against
refusals
to
enter
into
a
contract
or
continue
in
a
contractual
relationship.
under
that
rule
of
law,
a
black
worker
can
get
a
job
but
the
black
worker
can
be
forced
to
pay
a
very
high
price
for
that
job
in
loss
of
dignity.
the
employer
can
say
to
that
worker,
we'll
hire
you
but
only
if
you
submit
to
conditions
of
employment
in
which
you
are
humiliated
and
demeaned
because
of
your
race.
it
is
our
position
that
that
type
of
condition
of
employment
is
exactly
the
badge
of
inferiority
that
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
section
1981
were
designed
to
prohibit.
it
seems
obvious
that
a
black
worker
who
is
forced
to
pay
the
price
of
stigma
and
humiliation
in
order
to
be
able
to
perform
the
contract
that
she
has
a
right
to
enter
into
has
not
been
afforded
the
same
right
to
make
and
enforce
a
contract.
the
black
worker's
exercise
of
her
right
to
make
and
enforce
a
contract
has
been
burdened
because
of
her
race.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
submit
that
the
right
to
make
and
enforce
a
contract
has
to
include
the
right
to
perform
that
contract
free
from
racial
discrimination.
if
the
right
to
make
and
enforce
a
contract
is
going
to
have
any
meaning,
it
must
include
the
right
not
to
be
burdened
in
the
exercise
of
your
right
to
make
and
enforce
a
contract--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--no,
justice
white.
that
is
not
my
position.
my
position
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
employee,
the
worker
who
is
racially
harassed--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--in
north
carolina,
i
believe
that
mrs.
patterson
would
not
have
been
able
to
stop
the
harassment
in
state
court
under
state
contract
law.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
that's
right.
because
she
was
an
at-will
employee.
she
could
be
terminated
under
north
carolina
law
for
any
reason
whatsoever
including
the
bad
faith
reason.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
because
1981
is
not
concerned
with
what
is
a
contract.
1981
is
concerned
by
what
is
meant
by
the
phrase,
the
same
right
to
make
and
enforce
a
contract.
and
that's
a
federal
statute
that
prohibits
discrimination.
and
it
prohibits
more
than
discrimination
in
the
words
that
are
written
into
the
contract.
it
prohibits
discrimination
in
the
process
of
making
the
contract.
for
example,
if
the
employer
had
imposed
conditions
on
a
black
worker
that
were
not
imposed
upon
a
white
worker
as
a
condition
of
making
the
contract,
that
would
violate
section
1981.
and
in
this
case,
mrs.
patterson,
because
she
was
an
at-will
employee
was
essentially
making
a
new
contract
every
day
that
she
went
to
work.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
yes,
i
do,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it's
intentional
racial
discrimination
in
pay.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
practically
i
think
that's
probably
correct
because
section
1981
guarantees
the
same
right
to
make
and
enforce
a
contract.
and
my
position
is
that
when
the
exercise
of
that
right
is
burdened
by
racial
discrimination,
the
same
right
has
not
been
afforded.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
i
believe
that
it's
discrimination
in
the
making
of
the
contract
and
in
the
enforcing
of
the
contract.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
in
the
making
of
the
contract
because
mrs.
patterson
is
an
at-will
employee
under
north
carolina
law
and
everyday
that
she
goes
to
work,
she
makes
a
new
contract.
and
in
order
to
make
that
contract,
she
has
to
endure
conditions
of
employment
that
are
not
required
of
a
white
worker.
it's
the
same
as
if
the
employer
told
her
at
the
time
that
she
showed
up
to
apply
for
a
job,
we
won't
give
you
a
job
unless
you
stand
in
front
of
our
factory
for
an
hour
holding
a
sign
saying,
i
am
inferior.
and
that
was
not
required
of
white
workers.
that's
not
the
same
right
to
make
a
contract.
and
by
demeaning
mrs.
patterson,
by
making
her
dust
and
sweep
the
office,--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--i
think
ultimately
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
in
that
case,
if
there
were
a
fixed
term
of
contract
so
that
she
was
not
making
a
new
contract
everyday,
and
i
would
still
suggest
that
because
her
right
to
perform
the
contract
is
burdened,
that
she
does
not
have
the
same
right
to
make
and
enforce
the
contract
as
the
white
worker,
because
she
is
being
encouraged
not
to
enforce
her
contract
and
receive
the
benefits
of
her
contract,
but
to
cancel
the
contract.
that's
what
the
racial
discrimination
in
terms
and
conditions
does.
it
encourages
cancelling
the
contract
and
not
obtaining
the
benefits
of
the
contract.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
no.
it
is
not
our
position
that
she
must
prove
constructive
discharge.
it's
our
position
that
any
conduct
that's
intentional
and
that's
on
the
basis
of
race
will
affect
that
employee
as
to
whether
they
want
to
continue
on
the
job.
it
may
not
be
so
bad
that
they
actually
quit,
but
it
certainly
is
burdening
the
exercise
of
their
right.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
well,
with
mrs.
patterson,
because
she
is
an
at-will
employee
and
she
makes
the
contract
every
day,
i
would
contend
that
she
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
person
who
is
told
to
hold
the
sign
for
an
hour
before
they
will
be
hired.
but
even
assuming
that
we're
dealing
with
a
person
that
had
a
fixed
contract,
because
it
has
the
impact
on
that
person
of
treating
them
differently
and
discouraging
them,
making
them
think
about
whether
they
want
to
continue,
it
doesn't
actually
have
to
cause
them
to
quit
the
job.
it
discourages
them
in
enforcing
the
contract
and
therefore
they
have
not
been
afforded
the
same
right
to
enforce
their
contract.
there
doesn't
have
to
be
an
absolute
barrier
against
enforcement
of
the
contract
which
is
what
constructive
discharge
would
be.
it's
just
a
violation
of
the
same
right
to
enforce
the
contract.
she
has
not
been
afforded
the
same
right
to
carry
out
that
contract,
enforce
the
contract,
and
enjoy
the
benefits
of
that
contract
as
the
white
worker.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
the
solicitor
general,
as
i
understand
his
position,
comes
to
the
conclusion,
as
does
the
fourth
circuit,
that
section
1981
directly
protects
only
the
right
to
enter
into
a
contract,
regardless
of
the
conditions
of
employment
after
the
contract.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
yes,
justice
o'connor,
when
i
said,
directly,
i
meant
without
looking
at
state
law.
the
solicitor
general
then
says,
we
can
look
at
state
law
and
if
state
law
gives
a
breach
of
contract
remedy
to
a
person
like
mrs.
patterson,
that
would
be
read
into
and
enforceable--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--express
or
implied,
that
would
be
read
into
and
enforceable
under
section
1981.
again
i
believe
that
the
solicitor
general
focuses
on
the
wrong
issue.
i
would
agree
that
it's
appropriate
to
look
to
common
law
to
decide
what
is
a
contract.
but
we
have
a
federal
statute
that
protects
the
same
right
to
make
and
enforce
a
contract.
and
the
solicitor
general,
by
limiting
that
right
only
to
terms
that
are
read
into
the
contract
under
state
law,
does
not
give
effect
to
the
federal
principle
of
equality
that's
set
out
in
that
language,
same
right
to
make
enforce.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
well,
when
you
say
the
context
of
the
statute,
what
the
solicitor
general's
approach
would
do
if
it
had
been
accepted
in
1866
is
that
it
would
have
incorporated
the
black
codes
into
the
contracts
of
black
workers.
and
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
when
it
was
acting
in
1866
wanted
to
limit
the
coverage
of
section
1981
to
what
state
law
provided.
in
fact,
the
indication
is
to
the
contrary
that
congress
was
expressly
concerned
with
overruling
the
black
codes
which
limited
and
put
onerous
conditions
on
the
black
worker's
ability
to
enter
into
contracts.
and
if
there's
any
doubt
about--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--what
the
solicitor
general
said,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
you
look
to
state
law
to
determine
what
rights
are
protected
under
section
1981.
and
my
position
is
that
you
look
to
federal
law.
that
this
is
a
federal
statute,
an
equality
statute,
and
that
congress
explicitly
did
not
want
to
look
to
state
law
when
it
enacted
section
1981;
it
wanted
to
overturn
the
black
codes.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
that's
true
but
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
that
congress
wanted
state
law
to
govern
the
scope
of
section
1981.
and
let
me
say
with
respect
to
the
covenant
of
fair
dealing,
that
concept
really
doesn't
provide
any
additional
protection
beyond
what
the
fourth
circuit
would
have
provided
in
covering
absolute
refusals
to
enter
into
contracts.
because
in
north
carolina,
and
in
all
but
four
states
in
the
united
states,
where
there
is
at-will
employment,
the
covenant
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
simply
does
not
apply
to
the
worker.
the
employer
has
the
right
to
fire
the
worker,
except
in
four
states,
for
any
reason
whatsoever,
including
bad
faith,
and
therefore
that
employer
has
the
right
to
harass
that
worker
until
she
quits.
and
the
only
possible
situation
under
which
the
solicitor
general's
theory
would
apply
is
a
situation
where
the
worker
could
quit
and
claim
constructive
discharge,
but
does
not
quit,
stays
on
the
job
and
instead
sues
under
section
1981.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
the
worker
would
be
protected
by
title
vii,
if
title
vii
covers
her
employer.
but
the
court
in
johnson
v.
railway
express
made
very
clear
that
the
fact
that
title
vii
provides
a
remedy
does
not
mean
that
congress
wanted
to
undo
any
of
the
remedies
that
were
provided
by
earlier
civil
rights
acts.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
i
would
suggest
that
it's
not
an
independent
body
of
federal
contract
law.
it's
a
federal
equality
law,
a
federal
antidiscrimination
law,
and
in
this
case,
the
type
of
conduct
that
mrs.
patterson
complains
of,
while
actionable
under
title
vii,
title
vii
would
not
provide
an
adequate
remedy
because
title
vii
does
not
provide
compensatory
damages
or
punitive
damages.
and
unless
the
employee
quits
her
job,
unless
the
conduct
is
so
severe
that
she
quits
her
job,
she's
not
going
to
have
a
significant
back
pay
claim
because
she's
still
on
the
job.
so
the
only
way
that
employees
are
going
to
have
an
incentive
to
sue
to
stop
this
kind
of
conduct
is
if
section
1981
covers
it.
and
the
remedies
that
congress
wanted
to
make
available
to
supplement
title
vii
are
made
available
under
section
1981.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
i
do
not
believe
it
does,
justice
scalia.
i
believe
that
what
the
court
is
asked
to
do
under
section
1981
in
this
situation,
as
in
all
other
situations
where
it
enforces
section
1981,
is
to
develop
a
federal
law
of
what
constitutes
discrimination.
and
section
1981
was
intended
to
address
discrimination.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
no,
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
develop
a
federal
law
that
tells
you
what
is
in
a
contract.
my
position
is
that
regardless
of
what
is
written
in
the
contract,
what
are
the
terms
of
the
contract,
if
the
plaintiff
is
burdened
in
performing
that
contract
because
of
her
race,
that
she
has
not
been
afforded
the
same
right
to
make
and
enforce
a
contract.
and
i
think
the
court's
cases
make
clear
that
section
1981
and
the
parallel
provision,
section
1982,
go
beyond
merely
guaranteeing
an
absolute
right
to
enter
into
a
contract.
in
the
case
of
tillman
v.
wheaton-haven,
under
section
1982,
the
court
ruled
in
that
case,
and
again,
it
did
not
rest
its
decision
on
state
property
law.
that
case
involved
the
right
to
purchase
and
hold
property
under
section
1982,
and
the
right
to
join
a
swimming
pool
association
was
not
a
right
that
was
protected
under
state
law.
in
fact,
under
state
law
it
was
clear
that
the
swimming
pool
association
had
the
right
to
exclude
blacks.
and
furthermore,
the
right
to
join
the
swimming
pool
association
was
not
a
right
that
was
in
the
purchaser
deed
of
the
house
at
issue.
the
owner
of
the
house
had
no
control
over
the
swimming
pool
association
and
the
membership
in
the
swimming
pool
association
could
not
be
conveyed
along
with
the
ownership
of
the
house.
and
nonetheless,
the
court
held
that
the
membership
in
the
swimming
pool
association
was
a
benefit
that
became
associated
with
home
ownership
because
a
third
party
voluntarily
made
it
available
to
persons
in
the
area,
and
that
the
persons
who
were
making
it
available
could
not
make
it
available
on
a
racial
basis.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
certainly
conditioned
performance
of
the
contract.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
yes,
on
willingness
to
put
up
with
harassment.
otherwise,
mrs.
patterson,
it
was
an
absolute
requirement
that
she
put
up
with
this
harassment
in
order
to
continue
to
work
there
and
perform
the
contract
that
she
was
making
on
a
day
by
day
basis.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
that's
exactly
the
same
situation
in
my
view.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
it
might
depend
on
the
level
of
the
supervisor.
i
think
in
the
vincent
case
which
dealt
with
the
issue
of
sexual
harassment
under
title
vii,
the
court
explicitly
left
open--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--again,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
assume
that
you're
asking
me
two
questions.
one,
is
thirty
days'
worth
of
harassment
actionable.
and
two,
can
the
employer
be
held
responsible
for
that
supervisor
when
it
was
a
temporary
assignment
and
they
fired
him.
and
on
the
second
issue
on
whether
the
employer
can
be
held
liable.
i
think
the
court
left
that
open
in
vincent
under
what
circumstances
if
the
employer
took
very
prompt
action.
and
i
would
see
no
reason
that
the
same
agency
principles
that
apply
under
title
vii
according
to
vincent
would
not
also
apply
under
section
1981.
on
whether
thirty
days
of
harassment
is
sufficient
to
state
a
cause
of
action,
again,
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
facts
of
what
happened
during
that
thirty
days.
i
certainly
think
there
could
be
conduct
that's
so
egregious
that
even
if
it
only
occurred
on
one
or
two
days
that--
ms.
penda
d.
hair
--no.
i
think
the
standard
is
whether
the
same
right
to
perform
the
contract
has
been
afforded.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
well,
again,
if
the
conduct
is
intentional
and
it's
on
the
basis
of
race
and
the
black
person
is
treated
differently
than
the
white
person
because
of
race,
then
that
is
not
the
same
right
to
make
and
enforce
a
contract
in
my
view.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
well,
given
the
stipulations
that
you
have
given
me,
i
think
that
that
is
my
answer.
yes,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
yes,
justice
white.
i
will
briefly
address
the
second
issue
which
is
the
jury
instruction.
in
this
case,
mrs.
patterson
was
required
to
prove
both
that
she
was
denied
a
promotion
on
account
of
race
and
that
she
was
more
qualified.
and
that
simply
is
not
the
law.
the
question
is
whether
she
was
denied
the
promotion
on
the
basis
of
race.
there
are
a
number
of
circumstances
in
which
a
person
can
be
denied
a
promotion
on
the
basis
of
race,
without
necessarily
being
more
qualified
than
the
person
who
received
the
job.
the
most
obvious
example
is
where
the
two
candidates
were
equally
qualified.
and
even
if
this
employer
had
promoted
fifty
whites
who
were
equally
qualified
with
the
fifty
blacks
that
it
rejected,
none
of
those
fifty
blacks
would
be
able
to
bring
a
case
under
section
1981
for
promotion
discrimination
because
none
of
them
could
prove
that
they
were
more
qualified.
they
were
equally
qualified.
but
an
employer
is
not
allowed
to
choose
among
equally
qualified
candidates
on
the
basis
of
race,
and
in
this
case
there
was
more
than
sufficient
evidence
to
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
promotion
decision
was
being
made
on
the
basis
of
race.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
the
employer
articulated
the
alleged
superior
qualifications.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
i
think
that
there
was
certainly
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
to
allow
the
jury
to
conclude,
if
properly
instructed,
that
the
decision
was
made
on
the
basis
of
race.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
penda
d.
hair
may
it
please
the
court.
in
my
initial
argument,
i
did
not
reach
the
legislative
history
of
section
1981.
if
there's
any
doubt
about
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
makes
it
overwhelmingly
clear
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
onerous
treatment,
onerous
conditions
of
employment
that
former
slave
owners
were
putting
on
former
slaves
and
other
black
workers
including
whipping
them,
stopping
talking
on
the
job,
all
the
way
from
things
that
might
be
considered
miner
such
as
talking
on
the
job
to
whipping,
were
the
types
of
treatment
that
congress
was
concerned
about.
with
regard
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
about
whether
section
1981
guarantees
an
equal
right
to
perform
a
contract,
i
believed
that
the
court
reached
that
conclusion
in
footnote
78
of
the
jones
v.
mayer,
although
jones
was
a
section
1982
case;
footnote
78
discussed
section
1981,
and
it
held
where
a
group
of
whites
terrorized
blacks
in
order
to
stop
them
from
performing
their
contract,
that
those
whites
had
violated
the
rights
of
blacks
under
section
1981
to
dispose
of
their
labor
by
contract.
with
regard
to
the
jury
instruction,
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
were
no
facts
to
support
the
conclusion
that
the
reason
given
was
a
sham
and
that
the
real
reason
was
racial
discrimination.
justice
marshall
referred
to
two
racial
statements.
i
counted
nine
different
racial
statements
made
by
the
president
of
the
company.
and
justice
scalia,
you
asked
whether
mrs.
patterson
complained
about
those
statements.
the
record
shows
that
another
employee
did
complain
about
the
statements
and
not
only
statements,
he
complained
about
discrimination
and
refusal
to
hire
a
black
computer
operator.
and
that
employee
was
fired.
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
submit
the
promotion
claim
to
the
jury
and
particularly
the
district
court
relied
on
the
fact
that
mrs.
patterson
introduced
evidence
to
suggest
that
susan
williamson
was
trained
for
the
job
for
a
period
of
time
before
she
was
actually
promoted,
and
she
was
put
into
training
for
that
job
at
a
time
when
she
had
failed
in
her
training
for
a
computer
operator
job,
and
was
brought
back
over,
put
into
a
new
job.
there
was
a
vacancy
that
somebody
else
was
filling,
and
then
after
she
received
the
training,
she
was
actually
promoted
into
that
job.
and
given
the
direct
evidence
in
this
case,
given
the
evidence
of
training,
it's
simply
not
true
that
the
jury
instruction
was
harmless,
which
is
essentially
what
mr.
davis'
argument
boils
down
to.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
thank
you
very
much.
