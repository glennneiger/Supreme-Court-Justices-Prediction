justice
o'connor
ms.
hair,
i
take
it
the
solicitor
general
supports
reversal
here,
but
makes
an
effort
to
link
the
theory
to
the
language
of
section
1981
in
referring,
as
has
been
suggested
by
other
justices
this
morning,
the
the
making
and
enforcement.
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
sg
would
say
if
there's
an
implied
covenant
under
state
law
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing,
that
can
be
relied
upon
to
show
that
somehow
she
was
prevented
or
hindered
in
her
performance
under
the
contract,
that
that
would
support
reversal.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
didn't
understand
it
that
way,
since
they
refer
and
rely
on
the
implied
obligation
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
in
the
enforcement
of
it.
justice
o'connor
and
express
or
implied.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
does
see,
though,
to
at
least
address
itself
more
to
the
context
and
language
of
the
statute.
justice
o'connor
mr.
davis,
why
would
a
plaintiff
select
1981
as
the
basis
of
the
suit
instead
of
title
vii,
possibly?
justice
o'connor
yes,
why
would
any
plaintiff?
justice
o'connor
the
statute
of
limitations
may
have
been
the
question
here.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
davis,
what
about
the
sg's
argument
that
if
under
state
law,
there's
an
implied
obligation
or
duty
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
that
1981
can
be
implemented?
justice
o'connor
well,
this
case
wasn't
analyzed
on
that
theory
so
presumably
it
would
be
appropriate
then
to
send
it
back
and
let
the
court
make
that
kind
of
analysis
if
we
agreed
with
the
sg?
justice
o'connor
mr.
chambers,
let
me
ask
also
since
we're
talking
about
what
congress
has
done.
if
mrs.
patterson
is
correct
that
any
lawsuit
affecting
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
that
alleges
discrimination
can
be
filed
under
section
1981,
then
why
do
you
suppose
it
is
congress
established
the
eeoc
and
passed
title
vii?
they've
become
a
dead
letter.
they're
not
even
needed
if
section
1981
is
available
for
every
such
action.
do
you
think
congress
has
spoken
at
all
by
passing
title
vii?
