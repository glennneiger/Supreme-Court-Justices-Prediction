justice
scalia
well,
i
mean,
that's
a
question
of
proof,
i
would
suppose,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
you're
not
asserting
that
you
had
to
prove
that
the
racial
discrimination
was
of
such
force
and
effect
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
her
to
perform
her
job,
thereby
causing
her
to
break
the
contract.
justice
scalia
what
right?
it
has
to
burden
the
right
to
either
make
or
enforce
a
contract,
right?
either
make
or
enforce.
now,
your
example
of
the
person
with
the
sign
is
not
really
accurate.
that
isn't
what
happened
here.
if
you
said,
before
i
will
give
you
a
job,
you
must
stand
outside
in
front
for
an
hour
with
a
sign
that
says,
i'm
inferior,
there
you
are
burdening
the
making
of
a
contract.
but
what
happens
here
is,
you
give
the
person
the
job
and
after
the
job,
you
are
making
the
person
hold
a
sign
that
says,
i
am
inferior.
now,
if
that
is
so
burdensome
as
to
cause
the
worker
to
be
unable
to
perform
and
therefore
cause
the
worker
to
break
the
contract,
then
you're
interfering
with
the
right
to
enforce
it,
i
suppose.
but
i
don't
see
how,
if
it
doesn't
rise
to
that
level,
i
don't
see
how
it
burdens
her
right
to
either
make
or
to
enforce
the
contract.
justice
scalia
ms.
hair,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
run
away
from
state
law
and
say
it's
just
a
matter
of
federal
law.
i
mean,
you
have
a
statute
that
says
a
black
person
shall
have
equal
right
to
make
and
enforce
contracts.
now,
you're
either
saying
that
we're
going
to
develop
a
federal
law
of
contracts,
or
what
you
have
to
look
to
in
each
case
is
what
rights
do
these
state
citizens
have
under
state
law
to
make
contracts
and
enforce
contracts
and
are
those
rights
being
given
equally.
now,
doesn't
that
put
us
right
in
the
middle
of
deciding
what
the
state
law
is
concerning
contracts?
justice
scalia
it
may
be,
but
only
discrimination
in
the
making
and
enforcing
of
contracts.
it's
not
discrimination
in
the
open
air.
it's
discrimination
in
one
field.
now,
don't
you
think
that
this
has...
it
either
refers
to
a
federal
contract
law
or
to
state
law
of
contracts.
and
you
think
it's
a
federal
contract
law
that
we
have
to
develop?
justice
scalia
you
think
enforcing
a
contract
means
not
taking
it
to
court
but
how
else
do
you
enforce
a
contract?
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
say,
make
and
perform.
it
says
make
and
enforce,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
we've
been
talking
as
though
it
reads,
make
and
perform,
haven't
we?
justice
scalia
how
does
constructive
discharge
come
into
the
question?
justice
scalia
unless
you're
talking
make
and
perform?
justice
scalia
enforce
it
or
perform
it?
i
mean,
constructive
discharge
means
you
stop
somebody
from
performing
his
contract.
justice
scalia
you
see
no
difference
between
performing
a
contract
and
enforcing
a
contract?
justice
scalia
and
you
would
say,
i
really
don't
see
what
you've
accomplished
by
the
line
you're
seeking
to
draw.
you
say
constructive
discharge
would
do
it.
i'm
not
aware
that
to
establish
constructive
discharge,
you
have
to
quit.
you
could
continue
working
and
just
say
that
the
oppression
was
such
that
effectively--
justice
scalia
--you
have
to
prove
that
in
every
case.
all
right.
may
i
ask
you,
you
suggested
that
under
north
carolina
law,
thee
is
a
cause
of
action
for
breach
of
an
implied
covenant
of
fair
dealings
such
as
the
solicitor
general
refers
to.
does
that
cause
of
action
exist
when
the
employment
is
at
will?
your
opponent
says,
no.
justice
scalia
but
the
lack
of
evidence,
it
seems
to
me
is
a
reason
for
never
sending
the
case
to
the
jury,
not
a
reason
for
sending
it
to
the
jury
with
the
wrong
instruction.
it
may
well
be
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
two
of
them
had
equal
qualifications
and
race
was
the
reason
for
choosing
between
two
people
with
equal
qualifications.
but
in
that
case,
the
remedy
was
that
it
should
never
have
been
sent
to
the
jury,
and
you
should
have
appealed
on
that
ground
if
the
jury
verdict
wasn't
set
aside.
but
you're
not
asking
that.
you're
asking
for
the
giving
of
erroneous
instruction,
instead.
justice
scalia
but
that's
what
your
brief
boils
down
to.
you
say,
there
wasn't
evidence.
that
may
well
be,
but
that
means
that
no
instruction
should
have
been
given,
not
a
wrong
one.
justice
scalia
you
really
don't
know
that
you
brought
it
to
anybody's
attention?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
sure
what
this
argument
is.
public
acceptance?
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--well,
if
that
were
entirely...
entirely
dispositive,
it
wouldn't
be
very
important
what
we
do
on
the
subject
because
congress
would
simply
remedy
whatever
mistake
we
might
make.
i
mean,
if
they...
if
there
is
that
overwhelming
acceptance,
congress
would
simply
repass...
repass
1981
saying
very
clearly
that
it
applies
to
all
private
actions.
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
i
find
some
inconsistency
between
two
arguments
that
are
made
to
us:
one
being
that
everybody
has
accepted
it
and
the
society
wants
it;
and
the
other
being
that...
made
by...
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
if
we
should
go
back
on
runyon,
congress
wouldn't
be
able
to
pass
a
statute
to
replace
the
effect
of
runyon.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
strange
that
both
could
be
true.
justice
scalia
do
you
think
they
would
enact
1981
in
its
current
form?
justice
scalia
if
we
had...
if
we
had
had
to
interpret
the
act
in
1874
and
had
it
been
interpreted
at
that
date,
would
we
have
even
looked
at
the
legislative
history?
justice
scalia
really?
justice
scalia
in
the
19th
century,
we
looked
at
legislative
history
in
interpreting
statutes?
justice
scalia
i
think
you'll
find,
mr.
chambers,
that
until
probably
the
1920s,
we
wouldn't
have
looked
at
it
in
anywhere
near...
if
at
all...
in
anywhere
near
the
detail
that
was
used
to
render
our
decision
in
runyon.
so,
almost
inevitably
the
decision
rendered
in
1874
on
the
meaning
of
this
statute
would
have
been
different
even
assuming
that
the
use
of
the
legislative
history
in
runyon
was
correct.
almost
inevitably
it
would
have
been
different
in
1874
than
it
would
have
been
when
runyon
was
decided.
justice
scalia
when
was--
justice
scalia
--when
was
the
first
case
that
was
brought
under
this
new
statute
that
was
addressed
to
that
major
problem?
justice
scalia
cases
against
private
individuals
who
are
not
such
things
as
innkeepers
or
transportation
companies
or
perhaps
schools,
some
institutions
vested
with
the
public
interest,
so
to
speak.
when
was
the
first
case
that
involved
a
purely
private
individual?
justice
scalia
but
isn't
that
important?
i
mean,
if
the
act
was
clearly
meant
to
remedy
that
problem,
as
you
assert
the
legislative
history
shows,
you
would
have
expected
if
that's
a
big
problem
out
there,
that
almost
immediately
there
would
have
been
plenty
of
cases--
justice
scalia
--oh,
there--
justice
scalia
--there
were
cases
against
states
almost
immediately
after
the
passage
of--
justice
scalia
--against...
against
states.
justice
scalia
mr.
kaplan,
i'm
sure
that's
always
true
whenever
we
come
out
with
the
wrong
interpretation
of
a
statute.
to
some
extent,
we
have
interfered
with
the
function
of
the
congress
and
violated
to
a
degree
the
separation
of
powers,
which
is
the
point
you're
making
i
suppose.
but
surely
you
wouldn't
say
that
we
should
have
no
stare
decisis
whatever
in
the
field
of
statutory
construction,
would
you?
justice
scalia
so,
what
are
the
special
factors
that
should...
should
urge
us
to
disregard
stare
decisis?
why
is
this
case
special?
justice
scalia
my
only
point
is
to
question
your
statement
that
congress
has
affirmatively
decided
not
to
act
in
the
school
discrimination
context.
justice
scalia
you
see
we've
gotten
the
law
wrong,
but
that's
a
given.
that's
the
hypothesis
in
all
of
these
cases
where
we
say
we're
not
going
to
look
into
it.
we
may
have
gotten
it
wrong,
but
we've
gotten
it.
and
we're
going
to
leave
it
alone.
why
is
this
different
here?
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
what
to
say
there.
you're
not
answering
my
question.
that
is
always
the
case.
every
time
we
come
out
with
a
statutory
interpretation
that
is
wrong
and
congress
doesn't
turn
around
and
set
it
right
you
can
always
make
that
argument.
so,
your
argument
thus
far
is
boiling
down
to
the
proposition
that
we
should
not
have
any
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
in
the
field
of
statutory
construction.
justice
scalia
can't
you
tell
me
some
reason
why--
justice
scalia
of
course,
we
knew
that
when
we
decided
runyon.
i
mean,
it
isn't
as...
you
know,
it
would
be
different
if
title
vii
came
afterwards,
but
when
we
decided
runyon,
we
knew
that
we
were
carrying
coals
to
newcastle
in
a
way,
trumping...
trumping
legislation
that
congress
had
already
passed.
right?
it's
nothing
new.
justice
scalia
what
is...
what
is...
nothing
has
happened
that
makes
this
statute
or
this
interpretation
not
just
wrong,
as
you
keep
telling
us,
but
wrong
in
some
way
that
makes
it
different
from
other
statutes
that
we've
gotten
wrong.
i
expect
we've
gotten
some
others
wrong
over
the
course
of
the
year,
but
we
just
don't
go
back
and
look
at
them
anymore.
justice
scalia
i'm
still
waiting
to
hear
that
from
you.
you
keep
telling
us
that
it's
wrong.
let's
concede
that
it's
wrong.
so
what?
justice
scalia
why
should
we
go
back
and
change
a
decision
that
we've
made?
what
is
special
about
this
statute?
justice
scalia
if
that's
all
you
have,
mr.
kaplan,
i'm
afraid
it's
nothing
because
that's
always
the
case
when
we
interpret
a
statute
incorrectly.
what
you
have--
justice
scalia
well,
why
don't
you
just
argue
that
we--
justice
scalia
--not
broaden
it
then?
why
don't
you
just
argue
that
in
light
of
the
fact
that
it
was
originally
wrong,
as
you've
told
us,
we
shouldn't
broaden
it?
we
should
leave
bad
enough
alone
and
narrow
it
to
what
we've
already
held?
justice
scalia
that's
a
quite
different
argument
from
saying
that
we
should
throw
the
whole
thing
away,
though,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
oh,
we've
gone
beyond
private
schools
after
runyon,
i
mean,
in
later
cases.
we've...
we've
confronted
cases
that
involve
purely
private
discrimination,
haven't
we,
in
this
court?
justice
scalia
sure.
