justice
white
and
so
you
suggest
then
that
there
could
have
been
a
suit
by
the
employee
in
a
state
court
to
enforce
the
employment
contract
and
get
an
injunction
against
this
sort
of
harassment
based
on
the
contract?
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
that
suit
would
fail?
justice
white
because
it
was
not
a
provision
of
the
contract,
i
take
it?
justice
white
well,
now
that
would
be
a
problem
with
both
whites
and
blacks,
i
suppose.
and
so
if
she
couldn't
be
protected
against
racial
harassment
based
on
the
contract,
why
is
1981
violated?
justice
white
in
this
case
is
it
discrimination
in
the
making
of
the
contract
that
you're
complaining
about?
justice
white
in
what
respect?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
you'd
make
the
same
argument
if
that
was
a
contract
for
six
months,
an
employment
contract
for
six
months?
justice
white
i
take
it
that
you're
saying
that
the
employer
here
conditioned
the
contract
on
being
willing
to
put
up
with
harassment?
justice
white
is
that
it?
justice
white
it's
sort
of
like
saying,
well,
i'll
hire
you
even
though
you're
black
as
long
as
you're
willing
to
accept
lower
wages.
justice
white
you
have
another
part
to
your
case,
i
think.
justice
white
now,
did
the
employer
claim
that
it
was
on
the
basis
of
qualifications?
justice
white
and
you
think
you
proved
that
was
a
phony?
justice
white
i
think
that
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
indicated
there
would
be
no
cause
of
action
under
north
carolina
law.
justice
white
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
you
interpret
enforce
as
covering
the
situation
where
a
contract
is
frustrated
of
its
purpose.
justice
white
do
you
interpret,
enforce,
in
the
statute
to
cover
a
situation
where
there
is
a
frustration
of
the
contract's
purpose
by
reason
of
racial
animus?
justice
white
you
don't
think
enforce
means
just
the
right
to
go
to
a
state
court
for
relief?
justice
white
but
you
would
not
limit
it
to
that?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
if
an
employer
puts
a
condition
on
contracting
with
a
black
that
he
doesn't
insist
on
with
a
white,
that
there's
a
1981
cause
of
action?
justice
white
i
will,
sure,
i'll
hire
you
if
so
and
so.
and
it's
a
condition
that
he
just
doesn't
insist
on
with
whites.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
so
that
if
an
employer
expressly
said
to
a
black,
i'll
hire
you
but
remember
there's
a
lot
of
harassment
going
on
in
this
work
place
and
you
have
to
agree
to
that.
justice
white
but
you
don't
think
that
analysis
applies
here?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
it
went
on,
say
it
went
on
everyday
and
this
was
an
employment
at
will?
justice
white
and
the
reason
given
was
a
sham
i
suppose?
justice
white
how
does
this
all
lead
to
approving
the
instruction
that
was
given?
justice
white
i
know,
but
what
was
the
instruction
on?
justice
white
but
the
reason
the
employer
gave
was
that
she
wasn't
qualified
for
the
job.
justice
white
well,
and
so
you
think
that
the
instruction
was
nevertheless
proper
that
she
had
to
prove
she
was
more
qualified?
justice
white
you
say
it
was
a
position
that
wasn't
there
before?
justice
white
they
created
a
job
with
a
higher
grade.
justice
white
congress
spoke
33
to
33.
justice
white
thirty-three/33
and
33
abstaining,
i
guess.
justice
white
that
was
just
in
the
senate.
justice
white
justice
harlan...
justice
harlan
in
jones
thought
that
surely
1982,
for
example,
was
aimed
at
custom.
justice
white
well,
how
about
the
20...
how
about
the
20
year
business
that
justice
kennedy
mentioned?
justice
white
well,
how
long
does
it
take
to
have
a
custom?
justice
white
a
hundred
years
or
20?
justice
white
well,
anyway
you
think...
you
think
1981
reaches
custom.
justice
white
suing
private
people
who
are
acting
according
to
a
custom.
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know,
but
whatever
it
is
you
agree--
justice
white
--1981
covers
it.
justice
white
i'm
talking
about
a
custom.
justice
white
i'm
talking
about
just
a
custom,
just
a
custom
that
everybody
can...
let's
say
whatever
custom
is,
you
agree
it's
there.
does
1981
cover
suits
against
private
people
who
are
acting
according
to
custom?
justice
white
do
you
have
to
answer
that
way
or
not?
it's
hard
to
say.
justice
white
it's
hard
to
say.
justice
white
maybe
that's
what
this
lawsuit
is
all
about.
justice
white
--and
by
the
way,
i
take
it
from
your
brief
and
then
your
argument
that
if
we
agree
with
you
about
1981,
it
raises
serious
questions
about
jones
and
1982.
justice
white
well,
no,
no.
but--
justice
white
--if
a
case
came
here
and
someone
asked
us
to
overrule
jones,
if
we
agree
with
you
in
this
case,
there
would
be
a
powerful
argument,
wouldn't
there?
justice
white
it
would
not
just
affect
the
underlying
rationale,
but
your
principal
argument
about
overlap
between
the
later
statute
and
the
earlier
statute
applies
more
forcefully,
it
seems
to
me,
in
jones
than
it
does
here
in
the
housing
area.
and
the
overlap
argument
was
presented
in
jones.
and
it
was
specifically
considered
by
justice
harlan.
justice
white
well,
this
is
not
to
say
that
we've
never
overruled
a
statutory
precedent.
justice
white
and
we
have
many
times.
justice
white
but
you
say
that
none
of
the
past
cases
in
which
we've
overruled
or
severely
limited
a
precedent
is
any
kind
of
an
argument
for
overruling
runyon.
