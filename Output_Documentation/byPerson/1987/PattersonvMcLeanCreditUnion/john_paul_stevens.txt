justice
stevens
yes,
but
may
i
ask,
do
you
think
you
have
the
right
to
choose
between
equally
qualified
candidates
on
the
basis
of
race?
justice
stevens
but
supposing
she
offered
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
was
denied
the
promotion
because
of
her
race?
that
they
were
equally
qualified.
the
only
difference
between
the
two
was
that
one
was
black
and
one
was
white
and
that
because
one
was
white,
that
one
was
promoted?
justice
stevens
but
then
if
you
concede
that,
the
instruction's
wrong.
justice
stevens
well,
forget
the
evidence.
forget
the
evidence.
i'm
just
asking
you
about
the
instruction.
so
supposing
the
evidence
shows
that
they're
absolutely
equally
qualified.
and
the
plaintiff
says,
yes,
they
were
equal
and
they
had
to
figure
out
some
way
to
break
the
tie.
they
could
have
flipped
a
coin,
they
could
have
done
it
by
alphabetical,
they
could
have
done
it
by
age,
they
could
have
done
it
by
dark
hair
versus
light
hair,
but
they
did
it
because
of
race
to
break
a
tie.
is
that
permissible?
justice
stevens
well,
the
instruction
says
it
is.
justice
stevens
that's
one
of
four
factors.
the
third
factor
was
also
that
she
was
more
qualified.
justice
stevens
mr.
kaplan,
may
i
ask
a
question?
justice
stevens
mr.
kaplan,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
stevens
of
course,
runyon
wasn't
an
employment
case,
and
what
we're
really
focusing
on
today
is
whether
runyon,
which
was
a
denial
of
an
opportunity
to
go
to
school
case...
whether
that
should
be
overruled.
and
your
argument
really
doesn't
focus
on
that
all.
justice
stevens
i
know
this
is,
but
runyon
was
not.
justice
stevens
did
you
say
there
was
a
decision
of
congress
not
to
act--
justice
stevens
--after
the
legislation
that
your
opponent
stressed
in
his
opening
part
of
his
argument?
justice
stevens
your
opponent
made
quite
a
point
of
the
fact
that
congress
did
act
after
runyon
was
decided.
so,
i
don't
think
you
have
a
decision
of
congress
not
to
act
in
the
private
school
area.
justice
stevens
or
do
you?
how
do...
explain
that
to
me.
justice
stevens
well,
it
did
choose
to
do
so
shortly
after
runyon
was
decided.
that's
your
opponent's
point.
i'm
not
sure
of
your
response
to
that
point.
justice
stevens
correct,
but
you
do
presume
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
runyon
decision,
don't
you?
justice
stevens
once
again,
that's
always
the
case
where
the
court
makes
a
mistake
in
statutory
construction
and
congress
does
not
act
to
remedy
the
mistake.
that's
always
the
case.
what's
distinctive
in
this
case
that
would
justify
our
disregarding
the
normal
rules
of
stare
decisis?
justice
stevens
--don't
you
have
the
same
question
under
title
vii?
where
do
you
draw
the
line
in
this
kind
of
case?
how
many
racial
epithets
is
enough
and
how
much
pushing
around
is
enough,
you
know?
you
always
have
line
drawing
problems
in
any
statute.
justice
stevens
well,
you
don't
have
a
congressional
guideline
in
this
kind
of
case
in
title
vii
either.
justice
stevens
no,
but
your
argument
goes
to
the
question
of
when...
how
many
racial
epithets
are
enough
to
constitute
a
violation
of
the
statute.
you
have
that
same
difficult
problem
of
line
drawing
under
the
language
of
title
vii
or
under
the
language
of
this
statute.
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
kaplan,
you
don't
deny
that
there's
a
great
deal
of
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
congress
was
also
concerned
about
private
discrimination
in
the
south.
justice
stevens
a
good
many.
justice
stevens
mr.
harbor,
didn't
we
do
exactly
what
justice
scalia
suggests
in
the
baseball
area?
we
did
allow
the
erroneous
decision
to
remain
on
the
books
with
respect
to
baseball,
but
we
never
extended
it
to
football
or
boxing
or
anything
like
that.
and
congress
then
did
address
baseball
and
make
the
rules
it
thought
would
be
appropriate.
and
what's
more
important
than
baseball?
[laughter]
that's
right.
today.
