mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
basic
problem
in
the
presentation
of
the
petitioner's
arguments
in
this
case
is
that
they
start
from
the
wrong
baseline.
instead
of
looking
to
19...
the
1960s
or
1970s,
i
think
the
proper
point
of
departure
is
really
much
earlier
date,
1883,
when
the
court
handed
down
the
civil
rights
cases
and
indicated
in
a
opinion,
which
was
generally
respected
for
a
long
time
thereafter,
that
this
statute
would
not
reach
private
acts
of
discrimination.
many
years
go
by.
the
nation
matures.
we
encounter
other
types
of
problems,
particularly
in
the
area
of
racial
discrimination.
and
in
the
late
1950s
and
early
1960s,
there's
a
movement
in
congress
that
something
has
to
be
done.
and
after
four
years
or
so
of
angst
and
anger
and
controversy,
congress
comes
up
with
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
think
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
really
the
force
that
sets
in
motion
a
pattern
of
congressional
action,
a
decision
that
it
is
the
legislative
branch
which
must
take
control
of
these
things,
which
must
provide
the
remedies,
since
none
apparently
exist,
and
must
control
how
our
society
is
to
develop
in
terms
of
meeting
racial
equality
in
the
work
place
and
elsewhere.
the
problem
that
i
see
with
these
decisions,
runyon
in
particular,
is
they
threaten
this...
this
orderly
development
and
this
appropriate,
i
think,
allocation
of
authority
to
congress
to
deal
with
these...
with
these
measures.
title
vii,
for
example,
which
is
the
primary
statute
where
these
cases
really
come
up,
has
a
different
thrust,
a
different
emphasis,
than
section
1981.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
no,
i
would
not
say
that,
certainly.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
i
think
that
what
has
to
be
focused
on
is
the
impact
of
this
kind
of
legislation
or
rule-making
evident
in
runyon
on
the
operation
of
title
vii
itself.
and
i
think
this
has
been
discussed
and
noted,
and
i
think
it
bears
repeating
that
what
that
statute
is
emphasizing
is
a
conciliatory
approach
involving
a
government
involvement
by
the
eeoc
which
is
a
congressional
determination
as
to
how
things
should
operate,
and
also
a
specific
congressionally
determined
judicial
remedy
if
that
fails,
which
basically
is
equitable
and
remedial,
back
pay,
reinstatement.
this
rule,
the
rule
of
runyon,
allows
for
punitive
damages,
for
compensatory
damages.
it
cuts
the
eeoc
out
of
the
process.
it
doesn't
allow
it
to
escape...
to
shape
the
scope
of
investigations
and
determine
how
broad
the
remedies
should
be
made.
it
doesn't
certainly
encourage
a
conciliatory
approach
to
settlement
of
these
problems.
but
it
also
disregards
something
else
in
title
vii
which
is
federalism.
and
that
statute
specifically
encouraged
the
states
to
pass
laws
and
create
agencies
to
take
care
of
these
problems
and
solve
it
in
its
own
jurisdiction
through
the
deferral
procedure.
this
also
threatens
that
procedure
and
that
concern.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
what
we're
dealing
with
is
basically
a
congressionally--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--yes.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
it
does
in
a
sense,
your
honor.
what
i've
focused
on,
of
course,
is
the
employment
area
which...
and
this
is
an
employment
case
that
we're
dealing--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--but...
that's
correct.
but
even
the
areas
that
are
left
untouched
by
legislation,
such
as
title
vii
or
the
fair
housing
act
or
the
civil
rights
restoration
act,
are
themselves
decisions
of
congress
not
to
act.
and
that,
too,
i
think
has
to
be
respected.
it
is
not
the
function,
i
don't
think,
of
the
judiciary--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--yes.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
pardon
me?
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--well,
i...
i
think
in
the...
at
some
point
it
certainly
was
aware
of
the
problem
from
runyon,
and
it
certainly
passed
in
the...
i
suppose
the
civil
rights
restoration
act
could
apply
where
there's
funding.
but
what
congress
has
and
always
had
the
opportunity
to
deal
with
this
particular
problem
and
yet
it
hasn't...
it
hasn't
chosen
to
do
so.
the
problem
is
not
a
secret.
the
problem
has
been
there--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--well,
i
think
that
the
fact...
i
think
the
focus
on
runyon
is
misplaced
on
that
enactment.
what
the
response
was
certainly...
was
to
alyeska
and
runyon
happened
to
be
at
that
particular
juncture,
but--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--well,
it
cited
i
think
the
santa
fe
trail
case,
which
is
a
companion.
i
presume
that
there
was
some
knowledge
of
it.
but
i
think
the
focus
of
congress
in
doing
that
was
not
so
much
to
place
its
imprimatur
on
1981
as
a
reexamination
and
approval
of
everything
that
had
happened
there,
but
simply
as
a
broad
gesture,
a
sort
of
a
exercise
in
judicial
parity,
if
you
will,
to
create
an
equality.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
i
think
at
least
it
has
not
acted,
and
if
it
has
not
acted,
that
too
is
an
appropriate
aspect
for
the
court
to
respect
whether
or
not
it
acts
is
also
part
of
the
congressional
judgment.
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
court
steps
in
if
congress
hasn't
simply
acted
in
a
particular
area.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
the...
what
i
am
concerned--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--the...
again,
having
notice...
noting
that
the
court
has
made
its
decisions,
the
fact
remains
that
when
congress
addresses
these
problems,
it
has
an
option
to
address
particular
issues
or
not
to
address
particular
issues.
and
if
it
doesn't,
then
i
don't
think
it's
the...
it's
the
function
of
the
court
to
step
in
there
and
fill
in
all
these...
all
these
gaps.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
no,
but
i
think
there
are
some
practical--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--sure.
in
this
case,
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
illustration
which
occurred
in
the
oral
argument
which
took
place
earlier
this
year.
and
what
the
court
was
trying
to
define
there
was
the
statutory...
reconcile
the
statutory
language,
as
i
gather,
with
the
argument
that
the
petitioner
was
making
that
any
sort
of
complaint
arising
out
of
working
conditions,
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
can
fit
into
this
rubric
of
the
right
to
make
and
the
right
to
enforce
a
contract.
if...
what
is
happening
here
is
that
the
language
of
a
statute
which
was
designed
for
some
other
purpose,
a
more
limited
purpose,
has
been
used
now
as
a
general
anti-discrimination
device,
and
what
is
happening
is
that
the
court
is
running
into
a
wall
as
to...
as
to
the
interpretation
of
these...
of
this
enactment
which
it's
going
to
continue
to
find
problems
with.
it's
very
difficult
to
square
the
language
of
this
statute
even
in
a...
any
sort
of
case
which
deals
with
other
than
the
legal
capacity
issue.
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
how
do
you
determine
where...
once
you
go
beyond
the
right
to
make
it,
the
capacity
to
make
a
contract,
where
do
you
draw
the
line
as
to
what
is
covered
and
what
isn't
covered?
i
think
that
your--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--i
know,
but
often
you
have
a
congressional
guideline
to
give
you...
to
judge
by.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
in
this
kind
of
case,
there
is
clearly
a
coverage
by
title
vii
to
include
all
sorts
of
working
conditions.
that
has
been
generally
recognized
since
i
think
almost
day
one
of
that
statute.
but
in
this
statute--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--yes,
you
would
but
the
trouble
is
the
language
of
this
statute
doesn't
talk
about
or
doesn't
go
to
that
sort
of
problem.
what
it
goes
to
is
the
capacity
issue
of
whether
or
not
somebody
has
the
right
to
make
a
contract,
the
legal
capacity
to
make
the
contract,
the
legal
capacity
to
enforce
it.
what
this
type
of
procedure
does
is
to
remove
really,
to
cut
loose,
this
statute
from
its
roots
and
its
legislative
history.
and
what
the
congress
was
concerned
with
in
the
civil
war...
post
civil
war
era
were
these
statutes
and
rules
and
procedures
that
were
growing
up
in
the
states
which
threatened
to
deprive
the
freedmen
of
their
ability
to
make
contracts
and
to
enforce
them.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
i
would
suggest
to
you,
sir,
that
the
history,
if
read
in
toto,
strongly
suggests
that
they
recognize
that
there
were
incidents--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--and
quite
widespread
incidents
of
private
discrimination,
but
that
the
means
that
was
selected
for
dealing
with
the
problem
was
to
try
to
remove
these
disabilities
and
incapacities
that
were
arising
from
the
legislation
in
the
south.
and
i
guess
it
was
expected
that
once
this
was
cleaned
up,
the
normal
processes
of
state
court
adjudication
and
administration
would
avail
the
freedman
of
his
rights
under
this
particular
statute.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
no.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
as
i
said,
there
were
concerns...
expressions
of
concern--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--yes.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
yes,
both
sides
are
arguable,
but
i
think
when
you
come
down
to
it,
what
the
history
makes
clear...
and
senator
trumbull's
remarks
and
the
congressional
remarks
in
the
house
as
well...
is
that
what
they
were
aiming
at
were
these
black
codes
and
vagrancy
laws
which
would
disable...
disable
the
blacks.
in
terms
of
the--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--yes.
custom
i
think
has
a
distinct
meaning,
custom
and
usage.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
it
depends
on
how...
okay.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
it's
a
question
not
simply--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--okay.
you
can
have
a
custom
i
suppose
in
any
one
of
those
lengths
of
time
that
you
suggested.
i
think
the
operative
characteristic,
though,
is
whether
it
was
given--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--the...
yes.
i
think--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--how
do
you
define
custom
i
guess
is
the
question.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
but
i
think
what
they
were
getting
to
is--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--customary
law,
though,
law
that
arose
where
there
was
a
practice--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--in
the
community.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
no,
i
don't
think
it
that
circumstance
it
does.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
pardon
me?
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
it's
hard
to
say.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
i
think
that
a
practice
that
was
given
judicial
effect
if
it
had
the
force
of
law
that
was
actually
being
treated
as
law,
not
simply
an
obnoxious
practice
that
existed.
and
i
think
that's
what
makes
it
consistent
with
the
rest
of
the
statute.
the
terminology
that
appears
in
this
law
really
goes
toward
public
actors,
people
acting
in
the...
in
furtherance
of
public...
of
public
goals.
and
i
think
that's
really
why
this
statute
should
be
interpreted
as
applying
to
a
narrower
field
than
it
has
presently
been
given
effect
to,
and
that
the
decision
that
runyon
incorporates...
and
it
certainly
relies
on,
for
example,
the
johnson
railway
express
case...
should
be
reviewed.
there
are
other
problems
that
have
come
up
here
involving
coverage
in
terms,
for
example,
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
court
has
had
to
have
at
least
three
cases
dealing
with
that
issue
in
trying
to
resolve
it.
what
i
find
concerns
me,
though,
is...
and
i'm
getting
back
to
the
title
vii
issue
because
i
think
that
is
the...
has
to
be
the
primary
focus
because
that's
where
it's
primarily
being
used.
approximately,
from
what
we
could
tell,
three-quarters
or
more
of
the
1981
cases
come
in
the
employment
area.
and
so,
i
don't
think
you
can
ignore
that
particular
focus
on
this
statute.
and
what
is
happening,
as
we
began
to
mention
before,
is
that
it's
beginning
to
push
out
title
vii
as
a
remedy
and,
in
fact,
what
it's
doing
is
creating
an
overlay
of
additional
remedies
which
congress
did
not
decide
to
give.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should
be
in
the
position
of
furthering
that,
and
certainly
congress
can
consider
its...
the
effectiveness
of
this
legislation
in
that
area
and
also
determine
whether
or
not
the
need
is
there
in
other
areas.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
at
that
point,
yes.
there
had
been
previous
decisions.
at
least
the
johnson
case
had
directly
applied--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--well--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--well--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--the
problem
that
it...
the
specialty
of
the
statute
that
it
intrudes
on
the
operation
of
congress.
that's
basically
where
the
fundamental
problem
lies.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
i
think
runyon
was
based
on
an
incomplete
analysis
of
the
statute.
it
had
no
independent
analysis
of
its
own.
it
relied
on
johnson
which
itself
was
a
statute
that...
a
case...
excuse
me...
that
was
not
briefed,
that
did
not
a
thorough
consideration
of
the
case.
and
jones
itself
did
not
squarely
deal...
which
was
the
earliest
decision...
with
the
1870
to
'74
period.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
overrule
jones
as
a
1982
case,
but
because
there
is
a
common
source--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--there
certainly
is--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--it
would...
it
would...
i
think
it
would
possibly
affect
the
underlying
rationale
there
because
the
1866
act,
if
it
came
up
in
the
discussion,
certainly
would--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--yes.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
i
know
that,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
do
i
have
any
trouble
with
jones?
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
i
skipped
over
it
because
the
focus
of
this
discussion
was
on
the
runyon
case,
which
is
1981.
but
i
think
it
no
use
denying
the
fact
that
the--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--the
jones
case
would
be
there.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
it
doesn't
have
to
be
overruled
in
this
particular
proceeding,
but
nevertheless
to
the
extent
that
the
legislative
history--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--do
i
mind
jones--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--i
don't
have
a
particular
view
of
that
at
this
moment,
but
i
think
that
to
try
to
get
to
the
bottom
line,
i
think
that--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--the
underlying
rationale
could
be
affected
if
you
accept
our
view
of
the
1866
history.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
yes,
it
was.
yes.
the
jones
case--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--that's
the
law
in...
yes,
under
1982--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--it's
still
the
law
until--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--that--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--i'm
not
expressing
an
opinion
on
that
particularly.
i
am
saying
that
there's...
there
could
be
a
problem
of
that
rationale
being
exposed...
and
i
think
it
would
be...
if
this
case
were
turned
on
the
1866
legislative
history.
you
know,
i
don't
think
i
can
address
it
much
further.
i
note
that
the
rationale
has
started
to
run
into
some
problems
other
than
in
this
case,
which
is
title
vii,
and
the
bondari
type
case
which
is
on...
i
think
it's
still
on
petition
here.
the
fifth
circuit
has
refused
to
apply
this
rationale,
for
example,
to
alienage
discrimination.
and
that
may
yet
focus
a
broader
concern.
i
guess
what's
happening
is
that
there's...
there's
an
inevitable
push,
once
you
have
this
statute
or
endorse
it,
to
keep
broadening
it.
and
as
this
statute
or
the
coverage
of
the
statute
becomes
applicable
in
more
and
more
areas,
there
are
more
and
more
decisions
that
have
to
be
made.
and,
for
example,
in
the
runyon
case
itself,
you
had
to
deal
with--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--you're
sort
of
having
to
define
the--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--well--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--well,
it's...
the
question...
i
guess
the
argument
is
prompted
by
the
fact
i
believe
that
it
is
wrong.
if
you're
saying
that
it
could
be
limited
to
its
facts,
that
i
suppose
is
a
possibility.
i
note
in
the
runyon
case
itself,
though,
you
were
immediately...
having
created
this
statute,
you
were
immediately
testing
the
constitutional
limits,
it
seems,
by
having
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
association
and
the
problems
of
privacy.
i
mean,
this
is
what
i
think
starts...
starts
getting
to...
to
happen
when
you're
starting
to
make
this...
these
rules.
congress
might
relieve
you
of
that
problem
in
dealing...
in
dealing...
in
making
its
own
statute,
but
when
you
have
to
interpret
what
doesn't
really
apply
to
the
situation,
the
runyon
opinion
itself
suggests
that
you
may
run
into...
create
problems
yourself
that
start
approaching
a
constitutional
dimension.
and
that's
what
the
discussion
in
that
case
seemed
to--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--well,
i...
part
of
the
problem
i
suppose
with
the
runyon
matter,
which
concerns
me
obviously,
in
employment
cases
is
that
it
followed
the
employment
decision
which
was...
it
sort
of
put
the
cart
before
the
horse.
and
this
established
the
basic
threshold
principle
that
then...
then
the
employment
was...
was
bound
up
into
it.
i
think
that
the...
if
you're
suggesting
could
it
be
limited
to...
to
this
particular
area,
i
suppose
that
the
court
has
done
that
on
occasion.
but
i'm
not
sure
where
the
area
would
be
drawn.
if
you're
suggesting
a
purely
private
school,
which...
which
is
unfunded
and
has
no
government
involvement,
i
have
no
idea
how...
how
significant
that
is,
but
it
might
not
be
a
very
major
area--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--subsequent
to
runyon,
yes,
purely
private.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
but
the...
the
question
is
are
we
talking
about
limiting
it
to
a
particular
institution
or...
namely,
that
that
type
of
school...
or
are
we
talking
about
some
broader
areas.
and
i
don't
know
where
you
would...
would
draw
the
line
with
regard
to
that
in
view
of
the
somewhat...
the
fits
and
starts
that
have
appeared
in
this...
in
this
legislative
history.
i
guess
i
would
just
like
to...
to
finish
up
by
mentioning
that
the
types
of
issues
that
are
coming
up
are
specific
and
deal
with...
with
problems
that
i
think
are
better
suited
to
legislative
judgments
in
terms
of
their
breadth,
scope
and
type
of
remedy
that
has
to
be
made,
and
that
the
court
should
not
perpetuate
lawmaking
in
the
guise
of
interpretation.
and
i
think
that
should
provide
the
resolution
for
this
case.
thank
you.
