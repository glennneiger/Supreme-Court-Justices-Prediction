mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court's
order
of
april
25,
1988
directed
that
the
parties
address
the
issue
of
whether
the
court
should
reconsider
its
decision
in
runyon
v.
mccrary.
runyon
held
that
42
u.s.c.
1981
applies
to
private
contractual
relations
and
in
that
case
prohibited
a
private
school
from
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
race
in
its
admission
practices.
i
will
first
show
that
the
doctrines
of
congressional
ratification
and
stare
decisis
preclude
reconsideration
of
runyon.
i
will
then
demonstrate
in
the
remaining
half
of
my
argument
that
runyon
was
correctly
decided.
thus,
even
if
the
court
decides
to
revisit
runyon,
i
submit
that
runyon
was
correctly
decided
and
should
be
reaffirmed.
congressional
ratification
and
stare
decisis,
as
adopted
and
applied
by
this
court,
require
that
runyon
be
followed
and
not
reversed.
runyon
and
section
1981
have
become
a
significant
part
of
the
web
of
joint
congressional
and
judicial
efforts
to
rid
the
country
of
public
and
private
discrimination.
reversing
runyon
under
these
circumstances
would
not
only
reject
congressional
reliance
and
decisions
of
the
court
but
legislation
specifically
designed
by
congress
incorporating
the
court's
decision
and
attempting
to
encourage
the
use
and
enforcement
of
section
1981.
it
would
virtually
abandon
stare
decisis
as
a
fundamental
doctrine
of
a
court.
legislative
efforts
of
congress
since
runyon
and
its
precursor,
jones
v.
mayer,
show
a
consistent
pattern
of
congressional
adoption
and
ratification
of
the
court's
holdings
that
section
1981
prohibits
public
and
private
discrimination
in
contractual
dealings.
three
months
after
the
decision
in
runyon,
congress
passed
a
law
providing
attorney
fees
to
encourage
enforcement
or
use
of
section
1981.
the
attorney
fees
act
is
highly
significant.
it
is
not
simply
that
the
congress
was
aware
of
runyon.
it
is
not
merely
that
the
attorney
fees
act
shows
that
congress
approved
of
runyon.
both
points
are
true,
but
there's
more.
runyon
and
jones
were
the
foundation
building
blocks
for
the
attorney
fees
act
and
its
applicability
to
section
1981.
congress
built
on
runyon
by
passing
a
law
that
would
have
made
no
sense
had
runyon
not
been
decided.
that
is
true
because
runyon
and
jones
held
that
sections
1981
and
1982
permitted
an
individual
to
use
those
acts
to
challenge
private
discrimination.
if
jones
and
runyon
are
now
reversed,
there
would
be
no
basis
for
lawsuits
based
on
section
1981
and
1982
in
which
attorney
fees
could
be
awarded
if
one
is
successful.
the
fees
act
applies
the
private
attorney
general
theory
under
which
congress
encouraged
private
attorneys
to
use
civil
rights
statutes
to
vindicate
a
policy
of
congress
by
providing
a
fee
for
litigants
who
bring
jones
and
runyon
types
of
proceedings.
congress
asserted
that
the
people
who
litigate
those
claims
vindicated
congressional
policy
and
congress
wanted--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
we
also
would
have
been
able
to
recover
under
1983.
and
what
congress
was
doing
was
building
on
the
court's
decisions
in
runyon
and
jones
which
permitted
one
to
challenge
private
discrimination.
and
without
runyon
and
without
jones,
1981
and
1982
would
be
of
little
value
at
all.
so,
congress
noted
that
one
could
recover
under
1983
in
challenging
public
bodies,
and
it
wanted
to
encourage
the
use
of
1981
and
1982
to
encourage
lawsuits
challenging
private
discrimination.
this
is
of
direct
congressional
endorsement
and
ratification
of
runyon
and
jones.
and
i
don't
know
of
anything
else
that
congress
could
do
to
tell
the
court
that
it
accepted
and
ratified
and
wanted
to
use
the
court's
decisions
to
encourage
enforcement
of
1981
and
1982.
congress
expressly
said
we
endorse
your
decision
in
jones
and
runyon,
and
we
want
to
build
upon
it,
and
we
want
to
encourage
private
litigants
to
use
this
act.
as
congressman
drinan
said,
the
way
to
make
that
act
effective
is
to
provide
attorney
fees
so
that
private
parties
can
use
it.
now,
this
is
the
same,
in
our
position,
as
congress
expressly
enacting
1981
with
an
attorney
fees
provision.
it
endorsed,
it
encouraged,
and
it
wanted
to
make
that
act
a
part
of
the
civil
rights
provisions
that
would
permit
one
to
challenge
public
and
private
discrimination.
and
reversing
runyon
under
those
circumstances
would
in
our
opinion
fly
right
in
the
face
of
congress'
efforts
to
use
your
decision
to
prohibit
public
and
private
discrimination.
and
the
way
the
court
and
congress
has
worked
in
this
area,
where
congress
has
built
on
what
the
court
has
decided,
to
try
to
rid
the
country
of
discriminatory
practices
would
be
contrary
to
decisions
that
this
court
has
rendered
and
every
precedent
that
i
know
of.
and
i
don't
think
that
under
these
circumstances
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
strike
that
building
block
that
congress
had
built
to
remove
runyon
as
a
means
for
now
challenging
private
discrimination
in
contractual
matters.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
case
was
correctly
decided,
which
i'll
address.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
i
go
a
bit
further.
i
say
that
the
1976
attorney
fees
act
creates
another
step
that
the
court
should
not
overlook.
and
it's
something
stronger
than
stare
decisis.
congress
has
spoken
in
1976.
it
has
done
everything
it
could
do
except
expressly
adopt
that
statute.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--all
right.
my
point
is
that
the
court
said
that
one
could
use
1981
to
challenge
private
discrimination.
congress
adopted
that--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--that
is
one
prong,
your
honor,
but
my--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--your
honor,
you
have
a
number
of
precedents
that
say
that
unless
you
find
that
the
case
is
clearly
wrong
on
the
findings,
and
unless
you
find
the
other
exceptions
that
you
apply
in
deciding
not
to
follow
stare
decisis,
that
you
will
follow
stare
decisis.
if
you
find,
for
example,
that
the
court's
interpretation
is
clearly
wrong,
egregiously
wrong,
and
is
causing
problems...
for
example,
the
flood
case
dealing
with
the
antitrust
laws.
there
you
say
that
congress
has
shown
that
it
approves
of
what
the
court
has
done
and
isn't
changing
it.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
again,
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
the
court...
the
decisions
that
the
court
has
followed
in
this
area
where
congress
has
spoken,
and
i'm
referring,
for
example,
to
cases
like
bob
jones.
i'm
referring
to
cases
like
patsy
v.
florida
board.
you
have
looked
at
decisions,
and
you
questioned
whether
those
decisions
are
arguably
wrong...
the
precedents
that
were
being
considered.
you
questioned
whether
there
are
other
precedents
or
exceptions
that
would
warrant
the
court
deviating
from
that
prior
decision.
and
in
this
case,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
record
demonstrates
that
the
original
decision
was
wrong...
was
right...
that
is,
the
runyon
decision
was
correctly
decided.
and
even
if
you
had
any
question
about
it,
what
has
transpired
since
runyon?
what
congress
did
immediately
after
your
decision
in
runyon
i
submit
forecloses
the
court
now
setting
aside
the
runyon
decision.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
i
think
congress
did,
and
i
think
that
in
1972
congress
made
it
clear
that
it
wanted
to
make
both
remedies
available
for
challenging
discrimination
in
employment.
there
was
an
effort,
as
the
court
knows,
by
senator
hruska
to
make
title
vii
and
the
equal
pay
act
the
exclusive
remedies
for
challenging
private
discrimination.
congress
spoke
then
and
said
that
it
wanted
to
continue
both
remedies.
and
congress
spoke
again,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
in
1976.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
congress
spoke
more
than
that,
your
honor.
after
the
33
to
33
vote,
the
bill--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--well,
your
honor,
congress
voted--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--the
senate
voted
larger
than
that
on
reconsideration
and
decided
that
it
wanted
to
preserve
both
remedies.
additionally,
i
would
point
out
that
in
1976
congress
spoke
again
and
said
that
it
wanted
to
preserve
both
remedies
and
wanted
to
encourage
the
use
of
both
remedies.
so,
again,
under
congressional
ratification,
i
think
that
those
acts
of
congress
foreclose
the
court
from
now...
for
now
reconsidering
the
runyon
decision.
additionally,
i
would
point
out
that
in
applying
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis,
none
of
the
exceptions
that
the
court
has
used
is
applicable
here.
what
has
happened
since
runyon,
not
only
in
congress
but
in
other
acts
of
private
entities
and
governmental
bodies,
demonstrate
that
the
public
accepts
and
wants
to
perpetuate
the
use
of
the
runyon
and
the
jones
decision.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i'm
saying
that
the
runyon
decision
is
consistent
with
public
mores,
that
the
runyon
decision
is
what
the
congress
and
what
the
states
and
what
private
individuals
like
to
use.
and
they
are
building
on
it,
and
they
are
relying
on
it.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
in
this
area,
that's
not
the
way
that
the
bodies
of
government
have
operated.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
they
have
worked
with
each
other
and
built
a
body
of
law
to
prohibit
discrimination.
and
where
the
court
recognizes
that
congress
has
accepted,
relied
on
and
built
legislation
to
promote
the
use
of
1981,
this
court
has
respected
it.
and
that's
what
i
think
should
happen
in
this
particular
instance.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
brief
that
the
court
is
referring
to
poses
an
inconsistency.
what
the
brief
suggested
was
that
it
would
impose
a
burden.
it
would
be
time
consuming
for
congress
to
have
to
go
back
and
enact
a
law
to
replace
section
1981
if
you
reversed
it.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
your
honor,
i
don't...
i
don't
want
to
speculate
on
that.
i
think
that
we
would
have...
we
have
demonstrated
congress'
interest
in
preserving
1981,
and
we
have
demonstrated
that
this
court
has
respected
that
act
by
congress.
and
we
are
encouraging
the
court
here
to
follow
the
precedents
in
this
civil
rights
area
affecting
race
and
as
the
court
has
done
in
other
areas.
turning
then
to
the
legislative
history,
as
i
suggested,
runyon
was
correctly
decided
in
1976.
first,
let
me
address
the
defendant's
or
respondent's
position
that
the
1970...
1874
codification
of
1981
in
some
way
made
1981
a
fourteenth
amendment
act.
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
that
the
defendant
relies
here
on
a
headnote
and
some
notes
that
appeared
in
a
codification
of
1981
after
congress
had
codified
the
act.
but
more
particularly,
the
legislative
history
clearly
demonstrates
that
congress
in
codifying
section
1981
in
1874
was
codifying
both
the
1866
act
as
well
as
the
1870
act.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
legislative
history
of
1866
or?
i
think
the
court
would
have.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
because,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--i
think
if
the
court
had
a
question
about
the
meaning
of
1981,
if
the
court
wanted
to
fortify
a
decision
that
1981
applied
to
private
discrimination,
it
would
look
at
what
congress
was
trying
to
address
in
1866.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
would
differ
with
the
court.
but
the
point
is
in
1988
when
we're
looking
at
runyon,
we
look
at
what
congress
meant
with
the
enactment
in
1866.
we
look
at
what
transpired
in
1874,
and
we
know
that
congress
was
trying
to
address
a
pervasive
problem
of
enslaving
blacks
who
were
recently
freed
from
slavery
through
the
civil
war
in
the
thirteenth
amendment.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
what
we
were
trying
to
address
in
1866.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
don't
know
the
exact...
i
don't
know
the
date
of
the
first
case.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
historians'
amicus
brief
in
this
case.
they
refer
to
some
cases
that
are
not
reported.
and
in
addition,
the
court
may
be--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--your
honor,
again,
i
don't
have
the
date
of
the
first
case
against
a
private
individual.
i
only
point
out
that--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--well,
your
honor,
do
you...
well,
i
don't
know
the
first
case
that
was
filed
to
enforce...
challenge
the
black
codes.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
so,
i'm
suggesting
that
there
are--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--against
the
black
codes?
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
collection
of
cases
challenging
the
enforcement
of
the
black
codes
equally
missing
as
the
cases
challenging
private
discrimination
against
a
purely
private
individual.
and
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
the
nonenforcement
of
this
particular
section
of
the
act:
not
only
the
difficulty
of
getting
to
the
federal
court,
the
availability
of
counsel,
the
fear
of
individuals
in
trying
to
use
the
courts.
there
are
a
number
of
explanations.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
you
don't
find
a
case
in
1874
or
1875
challenging
a
purely
private
discrimination
suggests
one
way
or
the
other
that
the
act
didn't
reach
private
discrimination.
again,
i
submit
that
the
1874
codification
incorporated
the
1866
act
as
well
as
the
1870
act
and
that
congress
was
carrying
over
the
provisions
prohibiting
public
and
private
discrimination
in
1874.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
your
honor,
it
depends
on
whether
this
is
a
practice
of
harassing
or
making
the
working
environment
impossible
to
work
in--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--well,
your
honor,
i...
the
court
has
applied
title
vii
to
cover
harassment
in
the
work
place.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
there
are
some...
the
harassment
in
the
work
place
would
be
covered
by
both
title
vii
and
1981.
i'm
suggesting,
however,
that--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--in
this
particular
area.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
looks
at
the
facts.
and
the
court
hasn't
had
the
difficulty
that
the
court
pictures
here
in
deciding--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--well,
your
honor,
here
i
submit
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
wanted
to
reach
this
kind
of
conduct.
it
saw
that
freed
blacks
were
subjected
not
only
to
problems
in
the
contract
area,
but
also
after
they
got
on
the
job
and
were
working.
some
employees--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--sir?
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
we
have
to
prove,
your
honor,
that
there
is
an
intent
to
discriminate.
we
have
to
prove
that
the
supervisor
is
a
person
who
is
responsible
for
the
work
by
the
employer.
and
the
court
looks
to
see
whether
this
is
simply
an
isolated
incident
or
whether
this
is
something
common
to
the
work
place.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
statutory
words
prohibit
discrimination
in
the
making
and
enforcement
of
contracts,
and
that
covers
the
type
of
conduct
that
we
have
involved
here
with
ms.
patterson.
that's
the
point.
and
as
we
look
at
the
legislative
history,
we
see
a
congress
that
saw
blacks,
freed
blacks,
harassed
in
the
work
place,
denied
pay,
and
that's
the
kind
of
conduct
that
this
congress
was
trying
to
reach.
this
case
is
typical
of
the
conduct
that
congress
was
trying
to
address
in
1866.
so,
i
don't
think
there's
a
problem
about
applying
this
statute
to
cover
harassment
in
the
work
place.
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
i
think
we
go
back
to
look
at
where
congress
was
trying
to
address--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--your
honor--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--i
think
that
in
1866
congress
had
egregious
conduct
and
practices
that
it
wanted
to
correct
that
were
perpetuated
by
private
individuals.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
we
apply
the
law
to
the
facts
and
at
the
time
that
we
are
looking
at
the
situation.
i
think
that
congress
meant
to
reach
this
kind
of
conduct.
and
we
look
at
it
here.
it
might
different.
it
might
be
a
different
type
of
employer.
we're
not
working
the
farms
now.
we're
working
in
the
credit
union.
so,
the
type
of
discrimination
may
differ,
but
the
conduct...
the
discrimination,
the
enslavement,
the
badges
of
slavery
are
the
things
that
we
are
trying
to
reach.
and
that's
what
congress
meant
to
reach
in
1866.
again,
going
back
looking
at
the
conditions
that
congress
was
addressing
in
1866,
we
had
not
only
pervasive
practices
by
private
individuals
who
were
placing
blacks
back
in
slavery
as
before,
but
we
had
also
some
governmental
legislation.
and
what
congress
was
looking
at
in
1866
was
a...
was
a
condition
in
which
people
were
concerned
about
the
federal
government
reaching
state
practices.
we
all
concede
that
the
thirteenth
amendment
reaches
private
and
public
act.
we
all
concede
that
in
1866,
the
government
approved
of
reaching
private
practices.
and
so
congress,
in
enacting
the
1866
act,
was
trying
to
cover
pubic
and
private
practices
to
rid
the
country
of
the
slavery
that
we
had
just
enacted
the
thirteenth
amendment
to
cover.
i
want
to
reserve
some
time,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
first
would
just
note
that
the
respondent
really
offers
no
basis
for
the
court
not
applying
stare
decisis
here
and
certainly
for
not
applying
the
congressional
ratification
principle.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
no,
no.
i'm
just--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--i
concede
the
court
has.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
not
in
this
instance
from
what
we've
heard
and
really
from
what
we've
looked
at
and
what
we
submitted
in
our
brief.
second,
i
would
ask
the
court,
in
looking
at
this
act
that's
involved
in
the
patterson
case
in
terms
of
what
the
congress
was
trying
to
reach
in
1866
and
beyond,
we're
talking
about
a
black
person
trying
to
work
at
a
bank
who
was
subjected
to
harassment
and
on
working
in
conditions
that
make
it
unbearable
for
a
black
to
survive.
this
is
an
act
that
congress
was
trying
to
reach
in
1866,
and
it's
part
of
the
contract
that
the
1866
statute
reaches.
we're
not
asking
for
an
extension
of
runyon.
we're
asking
only
that
the
court
apply
the
statute
as
congress
originally
enacted
it
and
as
this
court
has
applied
it.
when
congress
looked
at--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--your
honor,
that's
a...
that
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it,
but
we're
looking
at
a
black
person
trying
to
work
on
a
job.
we're
talking
about
a
black
person
trying
to
get
a
job,
trying
to
work
with
a
contract.
and
we're
talking
about--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
--no,
your
honor.
we're
talking
about
a
black
person
trying
to
work
and
make
a
living.
that's
what
congress
was
trying
to
reach
in
1866.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
right
to
make
the
contract
to
allow
one
to
work
and
make
a
living.
look
at...
the
legislative
history
talks
about
this.
and
in
johnson,
where
the
court
talked
about
the
applicability
of
runyon
or
1981
to
contractual
matters
in
employment,
there
we
had
harassment
on
the
job.
when
congress
looked
at
the
runyon
decision
and
the
johnson
cases
in
18...
1976,
it
cited
cases
that
talked
about
harassment
on
the
job,
again,
a
proving
of
the
decisions
that
the
courts
had
rendered.
so,
we're
not
talking
about
any
extension.
we're
talking
about
the
applicability
of
a
statute
designed
to
make
it
possible
for
a
black
person
to
work.
that's
the
heart
of
the
matter,
and
that's
what
congress
was
trying
to
reach
with
1866
and
what
runyon
is
trying
to
reach
and
what
the
cases
subsequent
to
runyon
is
trying
to
reach.
in
1976...
1972
and
1964
when
congress
was
enacting
the
title
vii
or
the
civil
rights
act
of
that
time,
it
was
looking
at
pervasive
practices
of
discrimination,
and
it
wanted
to
provide
a
remedy.
and
it
said
it
wanted
to
provide
multiple
remedies
to
make
it
possible
for
black
people
and
other
minorities
to
challenge
this
kind
of
discrimination.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
thank
you,
your
honor.
