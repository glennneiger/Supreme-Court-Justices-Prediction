mr.
olson,
you
may
begin
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
depends.
you
know,
if
it
is
something
you
could
not
have
anticipated
before
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
maybe.
but
certainly,
your
punitive
damages
issue
could
have
been
raised
way
back
in
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
denied
your
petition
for
rehearing
without
opinion,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
olson,
in
our
other
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
proportionality
cases,
you
say
we
have
had
such
bad
luck
with
and
such
uncertainty
over,
and
i
think
you
say
that
quite
rightly,
we
have
looked
to
other
states
and
what
they
proscribe.
why
wouldn't
we
look
to
other
punitive
damage
awards
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
olson.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
ennis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
transcript
of
the
last
sentence
of
their
brief
is
this,
in
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
about
the
punitive
damages.
"it
is
excessive,
constitutes
an
excessive
fine
and
violates
due
process,
equal
protection,
and
other
constitutional
standards.
"
is
that
your
understanding
of
what
the
last
sentence
of
their
brief
said,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
something
can
be
raised
on
rehearing,
that
is
all
you
have
to
rely
on,
because
you
don't
have
oral
argument
on
most
petitions
for
rehearing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

you,
mr.
ennis.
