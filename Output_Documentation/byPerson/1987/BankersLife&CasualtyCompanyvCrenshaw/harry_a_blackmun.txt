mr.
olson,
did
you
abandon
your
contract
clause
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
olson,
you
say
"windfalls",
haven't
they
been
referred
to
as
"smart
money"?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
connotes
to
me
at
least
that
it
is
something
like
a
penalty
or
punishment,
doesn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
comes
right
out
of
the
word
"punitive".
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
there
were
many
states
that
did
not
have
them
until
very
recently,
and
states
larger
than
mississippi
got
along
pretty
well.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
that
again
is
routine,
really.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
this
case
is
a
very
convenient
one
for
a
mississippi
jury.
here
is
a
chicago
insurance
company
that
really
is
the
originator
of
the
mcarthur
foundation,
and
with
lots
of
money.
it
is
a
great
place
for
a
missouri
jury
to
run
wild,
isn't
it,
and
still
meet
your
criteria?
