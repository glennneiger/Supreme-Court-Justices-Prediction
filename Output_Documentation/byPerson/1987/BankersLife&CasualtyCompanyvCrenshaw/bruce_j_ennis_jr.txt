mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
i
will
certainly
address
the
punitive
damages
issues,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
rationality
of
the
appeal
penalty
statute,
because
in
our
view,
that
is
the
only
issue
that
is
properly
before
the
court.
the
penalty
statute
serves
several
legitimate
state
interests,
including
the
indisputably
legitimate
interest
of
conserving
judicial
resources,
protecting
the
integrity
of
judgments,
and
providing
some
measure
of
compensation
for
the
real
but
difficult
to
measure
intangible
costs
of
defending
appeals.
the
statute
applies
equally
to
all
parties
who
appeal
from
money
judgments.
if
lloyd
crenshaw
had
unsuccessfully
appealed
from
the
same
judgment
at
issue
here,
he
would
have
incurred
precisely
the
same
15
percent
penalty
that
bankers
life
incurred.
the
statute
conserves
judicial
resources
by
discouraging
marginal
appeals
without
preventing
them.
discouraging
appeals
in
marginal
cases
is
perhaps
a
more
important
interest
in
mississippi
than
in
any
other
state.
mississippi
is
one
of
the
few
states
that
does
not
have
an
intermediate
court
of
appeals.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
blackmun,
that
is
entirely
correct,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
mississippi
cannot
get
along.
it
is
getting
along.
but
in
addition
to
not
having
an
intermediate
court
of
appeals,
mississippi
has
chosen
to
allow
all
litigants
an
automatic
right
of
appeal
directly
from
mississippi's
40
trial
courts
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
may
be
routine,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
routine
in
most
states
for
there
to
be
the
backlog
of
appeals
there
is
in
mississippi.
in
mississippi,
the
average
time
in
cases
receiving
plenary
review
between
appeal
and
disposition
is
about
four
years,
as
it
was
in
this
case.
mississippi
wanted
to
address
that
chronic
backlog
problem,
and
discourage
appeals,
but
not
prevent
them.
now,
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
require
a
perfect
fit
between
means
and
objectives,
but
given
the
legislature's
objectives
in
this
case,
there
is
actually
a
very
close
fit
between
this
statute
and
the
desire
to
preserve
judicial
resources.
the
legislature
wanted
a
statute
that
would
be
as
self-executing
and
administratively
simple
as
possible,
so
that
already
overworked
judges
would
not
have
to
spend
additional
time
holding
individualized
hearings
to
determine
whether
there
should
be
a
penalty,
and
if
so,
how
much.
and
the
legislature
wanted
to
provide
an
appropriate
level
of
deterrence
by
providing
a
penalty
that
would
be
proportional
to
the
judgment
at
issue
and
which
could
be
known
in
advance,
so
the
prospective
appellant
would
be
able
mathematically
to
calculate
the
penalty
and
weigh
the
penalty
when
deciding
whether
the
strength
of
his
or
her
appeal
justified
the
penalty
that
would
be
imposed
if
unsuccessful.
given
those
objectives,
it
was
certainly
rational
to
limit
the
appeal
penalty
to
cases
involving
money
judgments.
that,
for
example,
explains
why
the
penalty
does
not
apply
to
plaintiffs
who
seek
money
judgments
but
recover
nothing.
applying
a
penalty
in
that
circumstance
would
require
the
mississippi
supreme
court
to
hold
an
individualized
hearing
and
make
an
ultimately
subjective
judgment.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
justice
brennan,
there
are
other
states.
virginia
and
kentucky.
in
fact,
in
a
case
not
cited
in
our
brief,
louisville
and
national
railroad
v.
stewart,
241
u.s.
261,
justice
holmes
upheld
the
kentucky
10
percent
appeal
penalty
statute,
precisely
on
the
ground
that
it
protected
the
integrity
of
judgments.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes.
it's
241
u.s.
261,
justice
holmes
upheld
kentucky's
automatic,
mandatory
10
percent
penalty
for
unsuccessful
appeals.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct,
justice
brennan.
in
fact,
it
is
even
correct
that
alabama
has
now
repealed
its
appeal
penalty
statute,
so
there
are
now
only
three
states
that
have
them.
the
second
interest
which
the
louisville
and
nashville
case
addresses
is
protecting
the
integrity
of
judgments.
if
there
is
a
money
judgment,
defendants
can
often
force
a
needy
plaintiff
to
compromise
and
accept
less
than
the
jury
has
awarded,
rather
than
to
incur
additional
expenses
on
appeal,
and
the
delay,
which
is
mississippi
will
be
about
four
years
before
a
plaintiff
can
use
that
money.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there
is,
justice
o'connor?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there
is
simple
8
percent
interest,
and
we
are
not
claiming
that
this
statute
is
needed
to
further
that
desire
to
get
interest
on
the
judgment.
but
what
happens
in
these
cases
is,
particularly
if
it's
a
large
judgment,
is,
needy
plaintiffs,
who
often
need
the
money
desperately,
simply
to
survive,
are
forced
to
compromise
the
judgment
and
accept
less
than
the
jury
awarded,
rather
than
wait
four
years
to
get
the
judgment
plus
the
statutory
interest.
this
statute
furthers
that
interest.
it
also
furthers
the
legitimate
interest
in
providing
compensation
for
the
intangible
costs
of
appeal.
for
example,
for
the
prolonged
uncertainty.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
they
are
certainly
similar,
justice
white.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
all
of
these
are
designed
to
make
the
appellant
take
a
second
look.
that
is
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
now,
having
identified
these
interests,
let
me
say
that
there
is
no
serious
dispute
between
the
parties
that
these
are
legitimate
state
interests
and
that
this
statute
rationally
furthers
that.
bankers
life's
contention
here
is
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
under-inclusive.
that
is,
that
it
only
furthers
these
legitimate
state
interests
in
cases
involving
appeals
from
money
judgments.
we
have
shown,
however,
why
it
is
that
the
statute
is
limited
to
appeals
from
money
judgments,
and
those
statutory
classifications
are
not
arbitrary
and
they
are
certainly
not
designed
to
harm
any
suspect
group
or
politically
powerless
minority.
furthermore,
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
statutes
can
be
very
under-inclusive
and
still
be
constitutional,
because
states
are
permitted
so
long
as
their
statutes
do
rationally
further
a
legitimate
interest,
to
proceed
one
step
at
a
time,
addressing
broad
social
problems,
step
by
step.
in
fact,
in
the
very
case
that
bankers
life
relies
upon,
lindsey
v.
normet,
this
case
upheld
a
statute
that
was
very
under-inclusive.
it
upheld
special
litigation
burdens
on
only
one
class
of
defendants
who
happened
to
be
tenants
in
eviction
proceedings.
in
the
mcrae
case,
which
we
did
not
cite,
291
u.s.
566,
this
court
actually
even
upheld
statutes
that
singled
out
insurance
company
defendants
in
suits
brought
by
policyholders
for
special
litigation
burdens
that
were
not
faced
by
any
other
litigants,
including
imposition
of
attorneys'
fees
at
trial
and
appeal,
and
a
12
percent
penalty
if
they
lost
the
suit
by
the
policyholder,
even
if
their
defense
was
in
good
faith.
the
court
did
not
find
that
that
was
an
under-inclusive
or
irrational
classification.
and
in
the
ortwein
case,
which
we
cited,
the
court
even
upheld
appellate
filing
fees
that
absolutely
barred
appeal
by
indigent
plaintiffs,
even
though
other
classes
of
litigants
were
permitted
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis,
as
the
appellants
in
ortwein
were
not.
that
statute
was
not
considered
under-inclusive.
it
is
true
that
in
the
lindsey
case,
this
court
did
strike
down
the
double
bond
provision
of
the
oregon
statute.
but
that
double
bond
statute
was
not
struck
down
because
it
was
under-inclusive.
it
was
struck
down
because
it
did
not
rationally
further
the
two
very
different
state
interests
the
state
relied
upon
in
that
case.
in
that
case,
the
state
interests
were
to
guarantee
recovery
of
rent
if
appeal
by
an
tenant
was
unsuccessful.
rent,
of
course,
is
easily
measurable
and
calculable,
unlike
the
intangible
costs
on
appeal
we
are
talking
about
here.
and
the
purpose
of
that
statute
was
not
just
to
discourage
all
marginal
appeals
as
in
mississippi,
but
to
quote
"prevent
frivolous
appeals".
that
statute
obviously
did
not
prevent
frivolous
appeals,
because
tenants
who
had
frivolous
appeals,
if
they
could
post
the
bond,
could
appeal.
there
are
other
important
distinctions
between
lindsey
and
this
case.
the
double
bond
statute
there
had
to
be
paid
before
appeal,
so
it
actually
did
prevent
appeals
by
indigent
parties.
in
mississippi,
this
penalty
does
not
prevent
appeal
by
anyone.
it
only
comes
into
play
after
the
appeal
is
unsuccessful.
i
will
turn
now,
if
i
may,
to
a
discussion
of
bankers
life's
challenges
to
the
punitive
damage
awards.
i
want
to
stress
as
categorically
and
clearly
as
i
can
that
not
one
of
the
federal
challenges
to
the
punitive
damage
award
that
bankers
life
has
argued
here
was
presented
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
even
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
after
the
affirmance
of
the
underlying
case.
accordingly,
based
on
a
long
line
of
cases,
which
we
cited
in
footnote
36
of
our
brief,
this
court
this
not
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
those
questions.
furthermore,
those
are
not
appeal
questions,
they
are
cert.
questions,
and
therefore,
even
if
the
court
had
the
power
to
hear
those
questions,
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion,
it
should
decline
to
do
so.
they
are,
of
course,
extraordinarily
important
questions,
which,
if
bankers
life's
position
is
accepted,
would
fundamentally
change
the
nature
of
federal-state
relations
and
would
require
states
very
substantially
to
modify
both
their
tort
law
systems
and
their
criminal
law
systems.
the
court
should
not,
in
my
opinion,
reach
out
to
decide
those
questions
until
a
case
properly
raising
them
is
before
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
i
do
not,
justice
o'connor.
i
take
the
position
that
the
due
process
claims
that
are
being
argued
here
were
not
raised
below.
they
did
raise
different
due
process
claims
below.
they
raised
below
the
due
process
claim
that
justice
scalia
referred
to.
that
is,
they
alleged
they
were
denied
due
process
because
they
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
contest,
not
the
punitive
damage
award,
but
the
penalty
imposed
on
that
award,
because
it
was
imposed
automatically.
they
have
not
pressed
that
due
process
argument
here.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
i
do
not,
justice
white.
let
me
be
clear
about
this.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
understand
hathorn.
hathorn
is
not
relevant
to
the
situation
now
before
court
and
we
are
not,
it
is
not
at
all
dispositive.
here
is
the
distinction
i
would
like
to
make.
there
are
two
reasons
why
this
court
will
not
accept
an
issue.
one
is
that
it
was
not
presented
in
the
trial
courts
of
the
state,
and
under
state
law,
if
an
issue
is
not
presented
in
the
trial
courts,
the
state
supreme
court
won't
hear
it.
this
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
trial
courts.
but
we
are
not
relying
on
that.
our
point
is
that
even
in
the
petition
for
rehearing,
the
issue
was
not
presented,
ever.
for
example,
let
us
take
the
excessive
fines
clause
issue,
which
is
the
most
important
one
they
are
pressing.
they
have
radically
changed
their
position
on
the
presentation
of
that
question.
in
their
jurisdictional
statement,
they
admitted
that
the
excessive
fines
clause
question
was
not
presented
even
in
the
petition
for
rehearing.
so
they
claimed
that
although
it
was
not
presented,
it
was
a
mere
enlargement
of
the
questions
that
were
presented.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
as
i
will
show
in
a
moment,
they
did
not
even
apply,
they
did
not
even
make
a
due
process
challenge
to
the
size
of
this
judgment
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
is.
let
me
make
two
points
about
that.
first,
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
is
clear
and
settled...
we
have
cited
the
cases
in
our
brief...
that
you
cannot
rely
solely
upon
arguments
made
in
briefs
to
support
the
jurisdiction
of
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
you
can
look
to
the
petition
for
rehearing
itself,
which
is
on
page
138(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
excuse
me.
it's
page
139(a).
there,
the
sole
reference
to
excessive
fine
is
contained
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
paragraph
just
before.4,
which
says:
"the
punitive
damage
verdict
was
clearly
excessive,
no
reasonably
related
to
any
legitimate
purpose,
constitutes
excessive
fine
and
violates
constitutional
principles.
"
now,
your
honor,
that
reference
to
excessive
fine
is
not,
unless
we
are
going
to
overrule
webb
v.
webb
and
a
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
sufficient,
because
it
does
not
refer
to
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
there
is
no
reference
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
or
in
the
brief
to
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment,
no
reference
to
the
eighth
amendment
at
all,
not
any
reference
to
the
united
states
constitution
at
all,
not
even
the
use
of
the
word
"federal"
in
the
petition
for
rehearing.
in
webb
v.
webb,
which
i
think
absolutely
demolishes
their
position
on
this
case,
this
court
ruled
eight
to
one
that
in
a
case
where
a
plaintiff
repeatedly,
at
every
stage
of
the
litigation,
used
the
phrase
"full
faith
and
credit"
but
did
not
say
"the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
"
that
was
insufficient
presentation
in
the
state
courts.
now,
the
court
in
that
case,
the
georgia
court,
did
no
even
have
a
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
so
in
this
court,
in
the
webb
case,
the
plaintiff
said,
i
must
have
been
referring,
and
it
could
only
have
been
thought
that
i
was
referring
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
federal
constitution,
because
the
georgia
constitution
doesn't
even
have
such
a
clause.
even
there,
this
court
said
that
was
not
adequate
presentation.
let
me
just
say
that
mississippi
does
have
an
excessive
fines
clause.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
it
is
the
clearest
possible
raising
of
a
due
process
challenge,
and
that
is
a
challenge
not
to
the
size
of
this
award,
but
to
any
punitive
damage
award,
because
the
defendant
cannot
know
in
advance
how
large
it
will
be.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
any
unrestricted
one.
that
is
correct.
but
that
due
process
challenge,
although
it
was
raised
below
has
not
been
pressed
or
argued
here.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
they
may
be
making
it,
your
honor,
but
as
you
noted
in
response
to
that
question,
they
don't
seem
to
have
spent
much
time
on
it
in
their
briefs.
in
fact,
i
don't
see
any
reference
to
it
in
either
the
brief
or
the
reply
brief.
in
my
opinion,
they
have
not
pressed
that
particular
due
process
argument
here.
let
me
continue
by
saying
that
although
they
have,
i
think,
revealed
the
weakness
of
their
position
on
the
presentation
of
the
excessive
fines
clause
issue,
by
changing
their
position
from
saying
first
it
was
a
mere
enlargement
and
now
saying
it
was
presented,
though
inartfully,
it
was
never
presented
in
the
way
this
court's
prior
decisions
require.
and
that
is,
showing
the
court
below
they
were
relying,
not
on
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
mississippi
constitution,
article
iii,
section
28,
but
on
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
there
would
be
very
serious
problems
under
the
due
process
clause
for
a
truly
criminal
case,
for
that
kind
of
an
award.
i
would
like
to
make
two
responses.
first,
punitive
damage
awards
are
not
criminal
sanctions.
and
second,
they
are
not
unlimited.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
common
law
restrictions
that
did
apply
to
amercements
were
applied.
they
are
applied
as
part
of
the
common
law
test
for
reviewing
punitive
damage
awards
and
were
applied
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
let
me
turn
to
that.
the
appellant
relies
almost
exclusively
on
the
amercements
clause
of
magna
carta
and
says
it
is
very
similar
to
punitive
damage
awards.
it
is
in
fact
very
dissimilar--
amercements
were
monetary
payments
which
were
paid
to
crown,
to
the
government,
not
to
private
parties.
they
were
not
paid
just
for
reprehensible
or
outrageous
or
intentional
conduct.
they
were
paid
in
almost
every
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it's
not
an
indeterminate
amount,
because
there
are
limitations
on
punitive
damage
awards,
that
they
not
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
scalia,
this
test,
the
"shock
the
conscience
test",
has
been
fleshed
out
more
than
that.
for
example,
under
the
common
law
test
for
punitive
damage
awards,
the
punitive
damage
award
must
bear
some
proportion
to
the
nature
of
the
offense,
not
to
the
financial
injury
to
the
plaintiff,
but
to
the
nature
of
the
underlying
offense.
it
must
not
be
disproportionate
to
the
nature
of
the
conduct.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
because
it
is
not
whether
it's
disproportionate
to
the
financial
injury
to
the
plaintiff,
it
is
whether
it
is
disproportionate
to
the
nature
of
the
offense.
the
nature
of
the
offense
in
this
case
was
a
practice
and
policy
by
bankers
life
to
withhold
claims
monies.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
would
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
offense,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
would
be
excessive
under
the
common
law.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
would
still
be
excessive.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
let
me
try
and
answer
that,
justice
marshall.
under
the
common
law,
under
the
amercements
clause,
even,
a
fine,
an
amercement
could
not
be
so
large
as
to
deprive
the
offender
of
his
means
of
livelihood.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
that
was
the
limitation
at
common
law.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there
are
two.
that
is
must
be
proportionate
to
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
that
it
not
deprive
the
offender
of
the
means
of
livelihood.
in
this
case,
the
punitive
damage
award
was
one
half
of
one
percent
of
bankers
life's
net
worth.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
if
the
punitive
damage
award
had
been
so
large
as
to
in
effect
force
bankers
life
out
of
business,
that
would
have
violated
the
common
law
standards
reviewing
courts
apply
in
reviewing
punitive
damage
awards.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
any
amount
would
be
too
much
if
it
deprived
them
of
their
means
of
livelihood.
that
would
be
the
common
law
test,
your
honor.
and
it
is
partly
for
that
reason
that
it
is
common
for
reviewing
courts
in
cases
involving
punitive
damage
awards,
to
reduce
those
awards
very
considerably.
some
awards
have,
when
issued
by
the
jury,
been
so
large
as
to
deprive
the
offender
of
a
means
of
livelihood.
they
have
all
been
cut
back.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
those
are
the
principal
tests
used
by
the
common
law.
which
brings
us
to
the
test
that
appellant
would
use,
which
is
not
those
tests
at
all,
it
is
not
the
tests
used
at
common
law,
but
rather,
proportionality
to
legislatively-enacted
criminal
fines.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
question
than
the
question
before
this
court.
i
would
personally
have
some
doubts
about
the
constitutionality
of
such
a
statute.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
this
court
has
perceived
a
very
important
difference
between
calling
things
civil
and
calling
them
criminal,
in
a
long
line
of
cases,
including
several
very
recent
cases.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
the
jury
did
not
run
wild
in
this
case.
the
fact
of
the
wealth
of
the
defendant
was
presented
to
the
jury
without
objection
by
bankers
life.
its
annual
statement
was
put
in
evidence
without
objection.
the
jury
instructions
under
which
the
jury
decided
the
amount
of
the
punitive
damage
award
were
either
proposed
by
or
accepted
by
bankers
life,
and
never
challenged
on
appeal.
the
jury
found
that
bankers
life
made
a
business
decision
to
withhold
$20,000.00
it
knew
it
should
have
paid,
because
it
mistakenly
believed
that
mississippi
was
a
penalty
state
in
which,
if
it
were
sued
for
bad
faith
refusal
to
pay
an
insurance
claim,
the
most
it
would
have
to
pay
would
be
a
penalty
of
approximately
$3,000.00.
it
was
because
of
that
mistake
in
judgment
that
bankers
life,
as
the
mississippi
supreme
court
put
it,
played
the
odds
and
skirted
a
bad
faith
cause
of
action.
bankers
life's
internal
claims
forms
required
all
claim
adjusters
to
indicate
whether
the
claim
came
from
a
punitive
damage
state
or
a
penalty
state,
obviously
because
in
a
punitive
damage
state
where
there
would
be
a
much
greater
possible
penalty,
bankers
life
would
be
more
inclined
to
pay
the
claim
it
knew
it
should
pay
than
it
would
in
a
penalty
state.
the
jury
was
entitled
to
conclude
that
this
was
a
corporate
policy
of
bankers
life
in
penalty
states,
to
withhold
monies
it
knew
it
should
pay,
and
that
it
had
engaged
in
that
practice
for
a
long
time,
because
it
had
never
changed
its
policies
in
mississippi
even
though
15
years
ago,
the
policy
provision
on
which
it
was
relying
was
declared
illegal
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
would
not
personally
characterize
them
as
quasi-criminal,
but
even
if
they
were
quasi-criminal,
that
does
not
mean
they
are
criminal.
in
a
lot
of
cases,
going
back
to
1851,
day
v.
woodworth,
this
court
has
squarely
ruled
that
even
though
punitive
damage
awards
are
in
part
designed
to
punish
and
deter,
they
are
not
criminal,
they
are
civil
sanctions.
the
rationale
that
bankers
life
proposes
would
have
to
apply,
not
just
in
punitive
damage
awards,
but
in
the
broad
range
of
civil
fines
and
sanctions.
for
example,
treble
damages
in
rico
actions
or
in
anti-trust
actions
often
exceed
the
maximum
criminal
fines
authorized
for
that
conduct.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
let
me
respond
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
if
we
really
want
to
pay
deference
to
legislative
judgment,
in
this
case,
we
would
win,
because
the
mississippi
legislature
has
squarely
rejected
a
bill
that
would
have
capped
punitive
damage
awards,
even
though
the
cap
that
they
rejected
would
have
been
150
times
higher
than
the
maximum
criminal
fine.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there
was
a
bill
pushed
by
the
insurance
industry
in
the
1986
legislative
session,
which
got
out
of
committee,
went
to
the
floor
of
the
mississippi
legislature.
it
would
have
capped
punitive
damage
awards.
that
bill
was
defeated
by
vote
of
the
mississippi
legislature.
i
think
that
reflects
a
legislative
judgment
not
to
cap
punitive
damage
awards
in
mississippi,
for
the
very
good
reason
that
a
punitive
damage...
i'm
sorry.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
if
you
want
me
to
finish
answering
that
question,
i
will
be
happy
to
do
so,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
thank
you.
