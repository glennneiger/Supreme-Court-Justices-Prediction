mr.
olson,
are
you
urging
us
to
say
that
$1,000.00
would
be
the
limit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
$1,000.00.
would
that
apply
to
general
motors,
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
anybody
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
it
was
what
bankers
life
was
worth?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
it
was
one
dollar
less.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
not
be
excessive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
it?
no
other
limitations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
bankers
life
is
a
corporation,
it's
not
an
individual.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
bankers
life
doesn't
have
any
livelihood.
does
bankers
life
have
a
livelihood?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
bankers
life
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
in
that
case,
we
hold
that
a
state
statute
imposing
a
15%
penalty
on
parties
who
appeal
unsuccessfully,
this
money
judgment
does
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
therefore
affirmed
the
judgment
below.
appellant
also
challenges
the
substantial
punitive
damages
award
but
we
conclude
that
this
challenge
has
not
raise
below
and
therefore,
we
do
not
reach
it
here.
