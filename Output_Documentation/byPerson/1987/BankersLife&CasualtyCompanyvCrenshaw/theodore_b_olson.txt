mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
large
punitive
damage
awards
may
constitute
excessive
fines,
in
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
this
issue
stems
from
a
mississippi
jury
verdict
in
favor
of
appellee
crenshaw
in
his
suit
for
a
$20,000.00
insurance
benefit.
the
jury
added
$1,600,000.00
in
punitive
damages
against
appellant
bankers
life
for
its
nonpayment
of
that
claim.
the
jury
verdict
was
affirmed
four
years
later
by
a
divided
mississippi
supreme
court.
that
court
then
added
an
automatic
15
percent,
$243,000.00
penalty,
to
the
judgment
against
appellant,
for
prosecuting
an
unsuccessful
appeal.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
the
validity
of
that
penalty
was
appealed.
because,
in
fact,
justice
brennan,
because
the
punitive
damage
issue--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
we
are.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because
the
punitive
damage
issue
is
a
logical
antecedent
to
the
question
raised
by
the
appeal
penalty,
because
we
regard
punitive
damage
as
the
central
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
exactly.
and
for
those
reasons,
and
because
the
other
issues,
including
the
appeal
penalty,
is
adequately
discussed
in
the
briefs,
we
would
like
to
concentrate
today
on
the
punitive
damage
question.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
are
arguing
both
on
the
basis
of
a
due
process
clause
objection
and
on
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
on
a
petition
for
rehearing,
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
which
this
court
has
held
is
an
appropriate
and
not
untimely
point
at
which
to
raise
such
an
issue,
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
submit
that,
and
perhaps
we
are
misreading
this
court's
decision
in
hathorn
v.
lovorn,
but
that
this
court
held
that
it
is
not
untimely.
the
rule
with
respect
to
mississippi
practice
does
not
regularly
and
consistently
preclude
raising
issues
in
a
petition
for
reconsideration.
and
11
cases
were
cited
in
that
opinion
to
support
the
proposition
that
mississippi
regularly
does
recognize
issues
that
are
raised
on
rehearing,
in
the
petition.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in
the
case
which
i
was
cited,
the
hathorn
case,
the
issue
was
not
passed
upon
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
this
case,
the
appellant
raised
the
issue
that
the
punitive
damage
award
was
excessive,
constitutes
an
excessive
fine
and
violates
due
process,
equal
protection,
and
other
constitutional
provisions.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
have
not
abandoned
the
contract
clause
argument,
justice
blackmun.
we
believe
that
the
contract
clause
argument,
though,
in
this
case,
forms
substantially
a
part
of
the
due
process
clause
argument
in
the
sense
that
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
was
in
the
process
of
changing
subjective
standards
with
respect
to
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages
in
connection
with
the
enforcement
of
a
contract.
so
we
have
not
abandoned
that
issue,
but
it
is
clearly
subordinate
to
the
due
process
clause
issue,
and,
we
submit,
to
the
punitive
damage
question
under
the
eighth
amendment,
which
we
would
prefer
to
discuss.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
let
me
answer
that
in
this
way.
in
this
court,
in
1966,
in
giacco
v.
pennsylvania,
held
that
a
$230.00
penalty
imposed
upon
a
litigant
after
a
trial
in
a
criminal
case
in
which
the
litigant
was
acquitted,
held
that
a
$230.00
penalty
imposed
upon
the
individual
because
of
reprehensible
conduct,
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution,
that
a
penalty
of
that
nature
and
that
amount
could
not
be
imposed
on
the
basis
of
a
subjective,
elastic
standard,
such
as
the
word
"reprehensible".
in
this
case,
the
standard
pursuant
to
which
my
client
was
punished
is
no
more
clear
and
no
more
specific
than
it
was
in
that
case.
the
only
difference
is,
in
this
case
the
penalty
was
$1,600,000.00.
and
that
is
the
principal
focus
of
our
due
process
clause
objection.
turning
to
the
punitive
damage
issue,
if
i
may,
i
don't
need
to
spend
too
much
time
reiterating
the
principal
characteristics
of
punitive
damages
to
this
court,
because
they
are
well-known
to
this
court
and
have
been
discussed
in
many
opinions
of
this
court.
but
i
would
briefly
like
to
touch
upon
four
principal
characteristics
of
punitive
damages
which
have
been
mentioned
by
this
court.
in
the
first
place,
punitive
damages
are
not
damages
in
the
traditional
sense.
damages
generally
and
traditionally
are
pecuniary
reparation.
but
as
repeatedly
characterized
by
this
court,
punitive
damages
are
not
to
compensate
victims.
they
are
only
windfalls.
as
counsel
for
mr.
crenshaw
stated
in
his
opening
statement,
we
are
asking
you
to
return
a
sizable
verdict
that
is
not
to
compensate
lloyd
crenshaw.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
they
have
been
referred
to
as
"smart
money".
and
i
am
not
sure
exactly
what
is
meant
by
the
term
"smart
money".
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
exactly.
something
that
will
"smart"
or
"sting".
that
was
my
next
point.
the
first
characteristic
being
that
they
are
not
compensatory.
the
second
characteristic
which
this
court
has
identified
is
that
they
are
in
the
nature
of
a
punishment.
they
are
private
finds,
as
articulated
by
this
court,
levied
by
civil
juries.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
comes,
of
course,
out
of
the
word
"punitive",
and
on
jury
instructions,
and
the
history
of
punitive
damages,
which
have
been
considered
over
and
over
again
by
this
court,
make
it
very
clear,
as
characterized
by
chief
justice
rehnquist,
punitive
damages
are
quasi-criminal.
the
third
characteristic
that
is
worthy
to
focus
on,
and
before
i
do
that,
with
respect
to
the
characterization
of
punitive
damages
as
criminal
and
as
for
punishment
purposes,
again,
the
same
theme
was
reflected
in
the
jury
instructions
and
the
arguments
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
the
third
characteristic
which
has
been
mentioned
by
this
court
is
that
the
standards
for
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages
and
subjective
and
elastic.
the
standards
for
imposing
punitive
damages
range
from
reprehensible
to
wanton,
to
negligence,
to
bad
faith,
and,
in
mississippi,
even
rudeness.
as
justice
brennan
put
it,
in
one
case,
juries
award
punitive
damages
in
their
largely
uncontrolled
discretion.
the
fourth
characteristic,
beyond
the
standard,
is
that
the
magnitude
of
punitive
damage
awards
is
utterly
capricious.
in
words
familiar
to
this
court,
punitive
damages
are
awarded
in
wholly
unpredictable
amounts,
bearing
no
necessary
relation
to
the
actual
harm
caused.
juries
have
awarded,
in
this
country,
up
to
$3
billion
in
punitive
damages.
appellate
courts
in
this
country
have
sustained
jury
awards
up
to
$1
billion
in
punitive
damages.
with
those
four
characteristics
of
punitive
damages
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
about
it,
justice
scalia.
the
appellate
courts
of
this
country
are
not
clear
in
their
articulation
as
to
why
awards
are
upset
or
why
punitive
damage
awards
are
sustained.
the
words
of
the
court
in
this
case
were
to
the
effect
that
the
punitive
damage,
it
did
not
matter
whether
it
was
high
enough
to
shock
the
conscience,
simply
that
it
was
not
too
high
to
shock
the
judicial
conscience
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
the
dissent
pointed
out
that
he
couldn't
understand
the
difference
between
shocking
the
conscience
and
shocking
the
judicial
conscience,
and
i
won't
go
into
that.
but
that
is
about
as
subjective
and
as
elusive,
and
as
elastic,
as
the
standards
are
at
the
appellate
court
level,
as
they
are
at
the
jury
level.
before
turning
to
the
affirmative
reasons
why
we
submit
that
punitive
damages
are
subject
to
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment,
i
think
it
is
my
obligation
to
discuss
very
briefly
the
statement
of
this
court
in
ingraham
v.
wright
that
the
eighth
amendment
applies
only
in
criminal
cases.
we
submit
that
that
is
not
dispositive
of
the
issue
that
we
bring
before
you
today,
for
several
reasons,
but
i
will
only
mention
three
here.
in
the
first
place,
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
ingraham
applied
only
to
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment.
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment
has
a
separate
history,
independent
of
the
bail
and
the
punishment
clauses
of
the
eighth
amendment.
secondly,
this
court
noted
in
footnote
37
of
ingraham
v.
wright,
that
some
punishments,
though
not
labeled
criminal
by
the
state,
may
be
sufficiently
analogous
to
criminal
punishments
to
justify
application
of
the
eighth
amendment.
we
submit,
and
i
think
some
of
the
things
that
i
have
said
already
today,
support
the
proposition,
that
this
punishment
is
sufficiently
analogous,
though
not
labeled
criminal.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
believe
that
the
eighth
amendment,
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause
has
been
held
applicable
to
the
states.
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
excessive
fines
clause
applies
to
the
states,
but
there
is
no
reason
to
distinguish
between
the
excessive
punishments
provision
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment
from
the
excessive
fines
clause.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because
of
the
separate
history.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
a
reason
to
distinguish
the
ingraham
case,
which
was
not
focusing
on
the
excessive
fines
clause,
and
on
the
history
of
the
excessive
fines
clause,
but
not
a
reason
to
take
that
one
level
of
punishment,
which
may
be
a
companion
in
many
cases
in
the
same
case,
and
distinguish
it
from
application
to
the
states.
the
third
reason,
and
your
question
leads
me
to
that,
is
that
the
historical
analysis
in
ingraham,
as
justice
white
put
it,
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
was
vague
and
inconclusive.
we
believe
that
the
reason
for
that
was
that
was,
as
we
have
examined
the
briefs,
and
the
historical
analysis
of
the
eighth
amendment,
tracing
back
to
the
english
bill
of
rights
and
to
magna
carta,
was
not
thoroughly
briefed
in
ingraham
v.
wright.
and
that
leads
me
to
the
affirmative
reasons
why
we
believe
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
apply,
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment
does
apply
to
punitive
damages.
there
are
three
principal
reasons
why
we
advance
affirmatively,
that
the
eighth
amendment
excessive
fines
clause
does
apply
to
punitive
damages.
they
are,
the
language
in
the
drafting
and
legislative
history
of
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment;
the
purpose
of
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment;
and,
as
i
have
mentioned,
the
historical
antecedents
of
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment.
first
of
all,
the
legislative
history,
the
language
and
drafting.
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
eighth
amendment
itself
limits
it
to
criminal
cases.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
amendment,
in
the
text
of
the
amendment,
that
it
should
be
limited
to
criminal
cases.
and
that
is
interesting.
because
the
eighth
amendment
was
debated
immediately
after
the
fifth
amendment
during
the
first
congress
of
the
united
states.
during
the
debate
of
the
fifth
amendment,
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
self-incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
would
not
extend
beyond
the
criminal
cases,
the
framers
added
a
clause
so
that
it
would
read:
"nor
shall
any
person
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
"
the
word
"criminal"
also
appears
in
the
sixth
amendment.
thus,
the
legislative
history
of
the
drafting
of
the
eighth
amendment
suggests
that
the
framers
knew
how
to
include
the
word
"criminal"
if
they
had
wished
to
do
so.
similarly,
as
this
court
has
noted,
the
eighth
amendment
traces
its
history
back
to
the
english
declaration
and
bill
of
rights
of
1689.
in
the
preamble
to
the
declaration
of
rights,
the
word
"criminal"
cases
modifies
the
bail
provision
of
the
declaration
of
rights.
but
when
enacted
in
a
statute
in
the
actual
statutory
portion
of
the
bill
of
rights,
the
english
bill
of
rights,
the
word
"criminal"
cases
is
not
included
as
a
modifier
either
of
the
excessive
fines
clause
provision
or
of
the
bail
and
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
provisions
of
the
declaration
of
rights.
furthermore,
this
court
has
noted
that
the
eighth
amendment
also
can
be
traced
to
the
virginia
declaration
of
rights
of
1776.
it
is
interesting
that
section
9
of
the
virginia
declaration
of
rights
prohibits
excessive
bail,
fines,
and
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
without
any
reference
to
criminal
cases.
section
8,
the
immediately
preceding
section
of
the
virginia
declaration
of
rights,
sets
out
a
whole
series
of
rights
and
protections
in
capital
or
criminal
prosecutions--
so
that
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
support
limiting
that
amendment,
the
excessive
fines
clause,
to
criminal
cases.
from
the
standpoint
of
a
purpose
of
analysis,
as
suggested
by
justice
white
in
the
dissent
in
ingraham
v.
wright,
i
think
that
i
need
no
say
any
more.
punitive
damages
serve
the
same
function
as
criminal
fines.
so
therefore,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
analogy
suggested
in
footnote
37
of
ingraham
v.
wright
or
the
purpose
of
analysis,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
excessive
fines
clause
should
apply
to
punitive
damages.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
historical
analysis,
the
more
one
examines
the
history
of
the
excessive
fines
clause,
and
its
antecedent,
the
excessive
amercements
clause
of
magna
carta,
the
more
one
is
stricken
by
the
similarity
between
punitive
damages
and
amercements
as
they
were
understood
in
the
13th
century
and
throughout
the
period
of
history,
leading
up
to
the
word
1689.
the
history
demonstrates
that
amercements,
the
concept
of
proportionality,
in
the
first
place,
does
not
date
from
magna
carta.
it
dates
back
to
ancient
hebrew
law,
to
ancient
law,
even
to
municipal
law
in
england,
prior
to
magna
carta.
the
concept
of
proportionality
in
punishment
is
based
upon
the
proposition
that
disproportionate,
unduly
severe,
arbitrary
or
capricious
punishment
is
unwise
and
unjust,
and
it
does
not
support
a
proper
system
of
justice.
saxon
law
did
not
distinguish
between
crimes
and
torts,
and
english
law
combined
the
concept
of
private
and
public
wrongs,
and
remedies
for
private
and
public
wrongs.
amercements,
and
later,
fines,
were
imposed
for
virtually
every
form
of
conduct,
including
civil
misconduct,
and
upon
civil
litigants.
by
1689,
the
date
of
the
declaration
of
rights
in
england,
the
terms
"amercements"
and
"fines"
were
relatively
interchangeable.
and
in
the
colonial
charters,
the
concept
of
moderation
in
punishment,
both
in
the
area
of
fines
and
in
amercements,
were
embodied,
those
concepts
were
embodied
in
those
charters
as
well.
book
iii
of
blackstone
discusses
private
wrongs,
and
it
is
interesting
to
examine
that
history,
because
blackstone
discusses,
in
chapter
after
chapter,
that
many
of
the
things
which
he
describes
as
private
wrongs
contain
both
a
private
component
and
a
public
component.
certain
of
what
we
recognize
today
as
torts,
those
which
were
regarded
as
breaching
the
peace
and
those
such
as
libel,
which
were
regarded
as
sufficiently
serious,
were
regarded
as
wrongs
to
an
individual,
but
also
wrongs
to
the
society.
the
wrong
to
the
individual
was
recompensed
by
damages
payable
to
the
individual.
the
wrong
to
society
was
dealt
with
in
the
form
of
a
fine.
and
it
is
interesting,
if
we
look
at
that
history,
and
compare
it
to
what
precisely
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case,
the
concept
of
a
private
and
a
public
wrong,
and
a
private
remedy
and
a
public
remedy
in
the
same
general
context,
the
consumers
union
amicus
brief
which
supports
the
appellee
in
this
case,
talks
about
that
there
were
two
separate
awards.
and
there
are
two
separate
awards
in
these
cases...
civil
damages
to
private
litigants
and
amercements
to
the
crown
in
the
form
of
public
damage,
in
english
history.
mr.
crenshaw's
opening
statement,
his
counsel's
opening
statement
in
this
case
said,
we
really
have
two
lawsuits
to
present
to
you
today.
the
first
is
mr.
crenshaw's
lawsuit
for
the
policy
benefits.
the
second
is
to
penalize
bankers
life.
the
same
is
true
in
the
closing
statement.
the
recognition
in
this
case,
the
recognition
in
history,
the
recognition
in
the
law
of
punitive
damages,
that
there
is
a
public
and
a
private
component.
the
private
component
is
dealt
with
in
the
form
of
damages,
the
public
component
in
the
form
of
either
wites,
which
was
the
pre-magna
carta
term;
amercements,
the
magna
carta
term;
fines,
the
english
bill
of
rights
term;
or
today,
punitive
damages.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
you
do
not.
this,
as
far
as
we
are
able
to
determine,
is
the
first
occasion,
other
than
the
case
two
years
ago
in
which
the
issue
was
not
reached,
in
which
this
issue
has
been
presented
to
this
court.
there
are
lower
court
decisions.
two
of
them
were
cited
in
my
opponent's
brief.
we
feel
that
those
lower
court
decisions
don't
stand
for
anything.
they
were
not
well-briefed,
and
in
both
of
these
cases
the
court
did
not
really
focus
on
the
issue.
all
of
this
seems
to
us
to
support
overwhelmingly
the
proposition
that
the
excessive
fines
provision
should
apply
to
punitive
damages.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
next
question,
logically,
therefore,
is
what
is
meant
by
"excessive".
this
court
has
had
some
strenuous
debates
and
some,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say,
difficult
times,
with
the
proportionality
issue
in
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
component
of
the
eighth
amendment,
particularly
as
it
deals
with
criminal
punishments.
but
there
is
no
question,
because
of
the
word
"excessive",
that
to
the
extent
that
the
excessive
fines
clause
is
applicable,
the
question
of
proportionality
is
a
key
consideration.
the
question
then
becomes
what
should
be
the
standard
that
this
court
adopts,
if
it
agrees
with
us
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
indeed
apply
to
punitive
damages?
we
have
articulated
this
in
our
brief,
and
let
me
just
restate
it
briefly,
that
the
objective
standards
to
which
this
court
should
turn
in
determining
whether
a
fine
is
excessive
is
to
those
objective
indicia
which
have
been
recognized
in
this
court's
other
eighth
amendment
cases,
the
legislative
enactments
from
the
states...
in
this
case,
the
state
of
mississippi.
as
we
have
pointed
out,
the
concept
of
proportionality
in
punishment
takes
into
consideration
what
the
society...
in
this
case,
the
society
of
the
state
of
mississippi...
considers
as
a
whole,
in
terms
of
the
scheme
of
things,
what
is
most
severe
based
upon
the
judgments
of
the
lawmakers
of
mississippi.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
most
severe
punishment
for
business
fraud,
the
closest
analog
that
we
can
find
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
is
a
fine
of
$1,000.00.
and
we
think
that
the
legislative
determinations
of
the
state
of
mississippi
with
respect
to
what
is
an
appropriate
level
of
punishment,
is
an
appropriate,
objective
indicia
of
what
this
court
should
turn
to
in
terms
of
evaluating
what
the
standards
are
in
mississippi
in
terms
of
the
severity
of
this
act,
and
the
nature
of
the
punishment
with
respect
to
it.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
would
be
very
happy
with
a
decision
by
this
court
that
this
punitive
damage
award
is
barred
by
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
we
have
covered
it
in
extensive
detail
in
the
brief,
and
in
fact,
the
due
process
clause,
the
implications
of
the
due
process
clause
are
all
over
the
eighth
amendment.
we
talked
about
the
elasticity
of
the
standards,
and
the
capriciousness
of
the
penalty.
those
are
due
process
concepts
as
well.
we
submit
that
the
resolution,
which
we
are
advocating
in
this
court,
is
not
going
to
require
this
court
to
examine
every
punitive
damage
case.
what
this
court
will
do
is
develop
a
set
of
standards
which
it
can
articulate,
requiring
the
state
courts
to
evaluate
what
the
legislature
has
determined
is
the
appropriate
scale
of
punishment,
and
then
instruct
its
trial
courts
to
instruct
juries
that
if
it
is
appropriate
to
grant
a
punitive
sanction,
and
it
does
pass
the
due
process
clause
test--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--in
this
case,
we
are
suggesting
that
the
objective
suggestions,
the
objective
criteria
established
by
the
legislature
of
mississippi
as
an
appropriate
penalty,
would
be
an
appropriate
punitive,
would
be
the
limit
of
a
punitive
damage
award
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
only
in
the
sense
that
the
state
of
mississippi
has
determined
that
a
$1,000.00
fine
for
business
fraud
is
the
appropriate
criminal
penalty
for
general
motors
or
anyone
else
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
exactly,
justice
marshall,
because
that
is
the
legislative
judgment
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
placing
on
the
scale
of
things
the
severity
of
crimes
punishable
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in
this
case,
i
submit
that
it
would
not
be
necessary,
that
the
state
of
mississippi
has
developed
a
range
of
penalties
which
are
appropriate.
on
the
high
end
of
things,
you
have
looked
to
other
states
to
determine
whether
perhaps
an
excessive
penalty
might
be
outside
the
scale
of
things,
based
upon
the
judgment
of
other
legislatures.
if,
for
example,
if
the
state
of
mississippi
were
to
legislate
a
penalty
which
would
involve
cutting
off
a
hand
or
something
of
that
nature,
then
it
might
be
necessary
to
go
to
the
next
step
and
to
look
at
other
legislative
determinations.
we
submit,
in
this
case,
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
that.
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
will
be
brief.
with
respect
first
of
all
to
the
appeal
penalty,
this
court
squarely
held
in
lindsey
v.
normet
that
access
to
the
appellate
courts
cannot
be
denied
or
barriers
imposed
that
are
over-inclusive,
or
over-broad
or
under-inclusive.
this
statute
is
all
of
those
things.
it
does
not
merely
punish
frivolous
appeals.
this
was
not
a
frivolous
appeal.
this
was
a
case
that
took
the
mississippi
supreme
court
four
years
to
handle
and
decided
on
a
five
to
four
basis.
it
could
not
be
construed
as
a
frivolous
appeal.
yet,
the
punishment
was
to
apply
here.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
have
no
way
of
knowing.
it
had
four
years
within
which
to
deliberate
it,
to
deliberate
the
issue,
and
from
the
opinions
written,
it
does
suggest
that
considerable
time
and
debate
was
spent
on
the
issue.
it
was
a
close
question.
it
certainly
wasn't
a
frivolous
appeal.
the
mississippi
statute
seems
to
me
to
suggest
a
statute
which
i
read
about
in
preparing
for
this
argument
that
existed
under
edward
i
in
england,
which
is
described
by
pollock
and
maitland.
in
that
statute,
under
edward
i,
if
an
appeal
was
rejected,
the
appellant
was
to
be
imprisoned
for
year
and
had
to
pay
a
penalty
in
the
form
of
damages.
according
to
pollock
and
maitland,
this
statute
is
a
typical
piece
of
medieval
legislation.
it
desires
to
punish
malicious
appeals.
it
actually
punishes
every
appeal
which
ends
in
affirmance.
that
is
exactly
like
the
mississippi
appeal
penalty
statute,
and,
as
pollock
and
maitland
said,
a
very
good
example
of
medieval
legislation.
with
respect
to
whether
the
issues
were
raised
in
a
timely
fashion
and
brought
to
this
court
in
such
a
fashion
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
we
have
not
hesitated
to
address
the
fact
that
the
issues
were
not
raised
in
an
elegant
or
sophisticated
or
detailed
fashion
in
the
mississippi
court.
but
they
were
raised
in
a
way
which
is
consistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
the
webb's
fabulous
pharmacy
v.
beckwith
case.
as
has
been
pointed
out
in
the
oral
argument,
the
excessive
fines
clause
was
expressly
referred
to,
this
penalty
was
referred
to
as
an
excessive
fine.
the
court
should
not
deny
jurisdiction
because
the
phrase
"excessive
fines
clause"
was
not
used
when
the
words
"excessive
fines"
were
used.
with
respect
to
the
due
process
objection,
my
opponent
has
made
the
point
that
this
is
not
criminal
penalty
and
it
is
a
civil
penalty.
i
refer
back
to
the
giacco
v.
pennsylvania
case
which
i
referred
to
during
the
earlier
part
of
my
argument.
that
issue
was
specifically
raised
in
that
case
in
a
$230.00
for
so-called
reprehensible
conduct.
it
was
after
the
individual
was
acquitted
and
the
state
made
the
argument,
this
isn't
a
criminal
penalty,
it's
just
like
costs
in
a
civil
case.
this
court
held,
and
i
think
it
was
unanimous,
i'm
not
sure,
that
you
cannot
fine
someone
$230.00
because
they
have
been
found
by
a
jury
to
have
acted
reprehensibly.
that
decision
is
dispositive,
it
seems
to
me,
with
respect
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
seventeen
years
ago,
this
court
struck
down
as
unconstitutional
a
practice
which
dated
back
to
medieval
england,
was
practiced
by
virtually
every
state
and
the
federal
government,
had
been
repeatedly
implicitly
approved
by
this
court.
as
the
court
then
said
in
williams
v.
illinois,
striking
down
incarceration
for
non-payment
of
fines,
neither
the
antiquity
of
a
practice
nor
the
legislative
and
judicial
endorsement
of
it
provides
insulation
from
constitutional
scrutiny.
the
punitive
damage
awards
should
be
recognized
for
what
they
are...
governmentally-imposed
penalties.
when
they
are
excessive,
they
are
unconstitutional.
