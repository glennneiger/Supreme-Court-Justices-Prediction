justice

day
o'connor
mr.
olson,
are
you
arguing
the
punitive
damages
question
on
the
basis
of
a
due
process
argument
as
well,
or
just
eighth
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
the
eighth
amendment
argument
ever
raised
in
the
state
courts,
mr.
olson?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
olson,
i
guess
we
don't
have
any
reported
decisions
that
have
found
and
eighth
amendment
violation
for
a
punitive
damages
award,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
were
to
apply
the
eighth
amendment
in
this
case,
what
do
you
think
the
result
would
be,
and
how
much
of
a
punitive
award
would
be
allowable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
a
post-judgment
interest
statute,
is
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
mississippi?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
no
due
process
claim
was
raised
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
agree
that
punitive
damages
are
quasi-criminal,
at
least?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
in
a
due
process
challenge,
at
least
those
have
been
determined
by
legislative
branches
to
be
appropriate
and
they
would
perhaps
survive
a
due
process
challenge,
wouldn't
you
think?
