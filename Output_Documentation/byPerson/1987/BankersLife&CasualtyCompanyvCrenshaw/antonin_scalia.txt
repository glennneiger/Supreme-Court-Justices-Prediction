justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
reach
the
appeal
penalty,
because
if
we
were
to
reverse
on
the
other
point,
you
would
have
won
the
appeal
and
you
wouldn't
pay
the
penalty,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
your
due
process
clause
argument
limited
to
the
contention
that
it
violates
due
process
not
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
excessiveness
of
the
penalty;
or
does
it
extend
as
broadly
as
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
would
have
it,
to
wit,
that
a
penalty
of
indeterminate
amount
is
simply
contrary
to
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
when
an
appellate
court
reverses
or
asks
for
a
remittitur
of
punitive
damages,
what
does
it
base
it
on?
what
does
the
appellate
court
say?
this
is
too
much,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
told
us
there
was
a
reason.
you
just
told
us
the
two
were
quite
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
olson,
if
we
proceed
in
this
case
under
the
excessive
fines
clause,
what
it
means
is
two
things.
in
each
case,
we
are
going
to
have
to
evaluate
the
particular
fine
and
find
out
if
that
fine
was
too
excessive
or
not.
and
secondly,
we
are
going
to
have
to
pick
another
number,
that
would
have
been
okay
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case.
if
we
were
to
find
in
your
favor,
on
the
other
hand,
on
the
basis
of
the
due
process
clause,
and
on
the
ground
that
the
vice
here
is
not
the
excessiveness
of
the
fine
or
at
least
we
don't
have
to
reach
that,
but
simply
the
fact
that
a
fine
may
be
imposed
by
a
jury
with
no
standards
whatever,
then
we
wouldn't
have
to
examine
each
case,
would
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
mean
the
legislature
would
have
to
come
up
with
some
kind
of
a
standard
and
we
could
evaluate
the
standard
instead
of
the
individual
judgment
of
each
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
do
you
want
us
to
do
it
on
the
excessive
fines
ground,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
haven't
given
much
time
to
it
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
direct
your
attention
to
page
135(a)
of
the
jurisdiction
statement.
this
is
part
(f),
not
of
the
brief
on
the
petition
for
rehearing,
but
of
the
original
brief.
and
it
says,
among
other
things,
this
goes
to
the
due
process
challenge,
not
the
excessive
fines
challenge,
it
says:
the
threat
of
unrestricted
punitive
damages
awards,
such
as
$1,600,000.00,
existing
whenever
an
insurer
litigates
a
contested
claim,
has
a
substantial
chilling
effect
on
the
exercise
of
this
fundamental
right.
the
right
referred
to
is
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
guaranteed
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
why
isn't
that
the
clearest
possible
raising
of
the
due
process
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
any
unrestricted
one,
without
a
limitation
on
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
asked
counsel
whether
he
was
making
that
and
his
response
was
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ennis,
to
get
to
the
substance
of
some
of
these
questions,
on
the
due
process
issue,
would
you
think
that
it
would
be
a
valid
criminal
statute
to
say
that
anyone
who
commits
a
particular
offense
shall
be
subject
to
a
fine
in
whatever
amount
shall
be
determined
by
the
jury
that
tries
him?
do
you
think
that
would
violate
due
process
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
they
limited
by?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
interested
in
that
for
the
moment.
you're
getting
off
on
excessive
fines.
i'm
far
away
from
amercements.
i
just
want
to
know
why
it
wouldn't
violate
due
process
to
allow
a
fine
of
indeterminate
amount.
you
were
going
to
tell
me
that
this
was
not
an
indeterminate
amount.
then
we
got
lost
somehow.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
a
limitation,
that
it
not
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court?
all
right.
change
my
criminal
statute.
you
will
be
subjected
to
a
fine
in
whatever
amount
shall
not
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court.
that
would
be
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
mean,
if
$1,600,000.00
is
not
disproportionate,
as
you
say
it
isn't,
and
as
your
court
said
it
wasn't,
to
a
failure
to
pay
a
much
lesser
claim,
insurance
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
are
saying.
is
that
a
standard,
whether
it's
disproportionate
to
the
nature
of
the
offense?
would
$5
million
be?
would
ten?
would
a
hundred?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
a
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
it
only
had
$50.00
left
in
the
till
and
the
jury
hits
it
with
a
$50.00
punitive
damage,
which
tilts
it
over
into
bankruptcy,
$50.00
would
be
too
much?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
tests
are,
not
shock
the
judicial
conscience,
not
deprive
of
means
of
livelihood
and
thirdly,
not
be
excessive
in
relation
to
the
offense,
whatever
that
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
criminal
statute
that
had
those
three
tests.
if
you
commit
such
and
such
an
offense,
you
shall
be
liable
to
a
fine
which
may
be
in
any
amount
determined
by
the
jury,
provided
that
it
shall
not
shock
the
judicial
conscience,
shall
not
deprive
you
of
a
livelihood,
and
shall
not
be
disproportionate
to
the
offense.
do
you
think
that
would
be
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would,
too,
and
i
don't
see
very
much
difference
if
you
call
it
civil
or
criminal.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
legislative
judgment,
mr.
ennis,
one
legislative
judgment
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
defer
to
is
the
legislative
judgment
not
to
make
a
legislative
judgment.
and
that
is
what
you
are
talking
about.
no,
your
honor.
my
position
is
simply
this.
bankers
life
is
arguing
that
the
sole
benchmark
for
determining
the
excessiveness
of
an
award
ought
to
be
the
legislative
judgment
of
what
is
appropriate
in
the
criminal
context.
of
course,
that
ignores
the
fact
that
the
fine
in
the
criminal
sanction
is
only
a
very
small
component
of
the
total
criminal
sanction.
it
admits,
for
example,
incarceration
and
loss
of
business
license
and
other
penalties
like
that.
i
think
that
the
fair
way
to
look
at
this
is
that
legislatures
know
about
what
is
going
on
out
there
in
tort
awards
and
punitive
damage
awards.
some
legislatures
have
adopted
caps.
others
have
chosen
not
to.
the
mississippi
legislature
has
squarely
chosen
not
to.
is
there
a
statute
that
says
they
have
chosen
not
to?
can
a
legislature
choose
something
by
not
enacting
a
statute?
