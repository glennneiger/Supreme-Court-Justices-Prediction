what
about
the
excessive
fines
clause
itself?
does
it
apply
to
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
the
second
really
the
same
as
the
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
just
supposed
to
make
the
appellant
take
a
second
look.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
see
what
his
hole
card
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
mississippi
had
a
rule
that
was
just
as
expressed
as
it
could
be,
that
it
shall
be
no
barrier
to
our
consideration
of
the
claim
if
you
wait
until
petition
for
rehearing
to
raise
it.
so
if
you've
got
anything
left
over
after
we've
written
an
opinion,
bring
it
up
on
the
rehearing.
and
most
of
the
time,
the
court
entertains
them
in
the
sense
they
let
them
be
filed,
and
then
they
just
deny
them
without
opinion.
now,
i
suppose
that
is
just
passing
on
it.
they
are
raised
and
passed
on.
do
you
think
our
rules
would
bar
our
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about,
what
do
you
make
out
of
hathorn?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
due
process
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
after
all,
it
takes
the
due
process
clause
to
apply
the
eighth
amendment
anyway.
