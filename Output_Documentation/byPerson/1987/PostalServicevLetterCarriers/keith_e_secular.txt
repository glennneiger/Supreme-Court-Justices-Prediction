mr.
keith
e.
secular
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
referring
to
one
specific
point
that
justice
scalia
raised.
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
there
is
an
alternative
job.
this
arbitrator's
decision
requires
the
grievant,
mr.
hyde,
to
be
reinstated
to
the
payroll
of
the
postal
service
and
that
is
all.
at
that
point,
the
postal
service
is
free
to
implement
the
full
range
of
its
managerial
rights.
and
among
those
rights
is
to
make
a
reasonable
determination
that
someone
is
disabled
for
physical
or
psychological
reasons,
and
cannot
perform
the
functions
of
his
position.
at
that
point,
the
postal
service
can
assign
a
man
to
other
duties.
it
can
put
him
on
medical
furlough.
it
can
require
him
to
be
examined
by
a
psychiatrist.
all
of
those
things
can
happen.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
justice
white,
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
fair
presumption.
the
central
premise
of
our
labor
law
jurisprudence
is
that
the
parties
have
a
healthy
constructive
collective
bargaining
relationship.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
i
think
that
the
point
is
that
the
risk
to
the
security
of
the
mails
that
is
posed
by
the
government
does
not
exist
here,
because,
and
we
have
not
contested,
there
are
other
things
that
can
happen
here.
whether
the
union
grieves
or
not,
if
management
is
right,
that
will
be
established
through
the
grievance
procedure.
this
kind
of
procedure
is
something
that
happens
every
day
in
the
postal
service.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
yes,
this
person
is
a
letter
carrier,
but
there
are.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
the
answer
is
that
he
can
be
kept
in
the
office.
a
lot
of
what
a
letter
carrier
does
is
in
the
office.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
no,
he
can
sort
mail
within
the
office.
i
think
that
it
is
a
real
stretch
to
say
that
hyde,
even
if
he
remains
as
disturbed
as
he
was
at
the
time
of
these
incidents,
is
going
to
mishandle
the
mail
in
the
office
in
full
view
of
his
supervisors
and
coworkers,
i
mean
the
analogy--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
even
if
the
award
said
that,
what
i
am
in
effect
conceding
is
that
under
our
contract
and
under
postal
regulations
that
the
postal
service
is
not
locked
into
sending
this
man
out
on
the
street.
there
is
more
that
can
happen.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
i
think
that
is
one
possible
disposition.
i
think
that
there
is
a
lot
more
to
the
case,
and
i
will
address
that
now.
let
me
begin
by
making
the
point
that
i
think
that
the
case,
as
it
has
been
defined
in
the
briefs,
is
extraordinarily
narrow.
the
postal
service
has
conceded
that
it
may
employ
persons
who
have
been
convicted
of
crimes,
including
persons
who
have
convicted
crimes
in
his
phrase
against
the
mails.
it
concedes
that
it
can
employ
persons
who
have
had
physical
and
mental
disorders.
and
there
is
even
a
concession
in
the
reply
brief
that
the
postal
service
can
employ
an
individual
with
a
history
of
compulsive
gambling.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
that
is
right.
that
is
now
the
issue.
the
issue
is
that
this
is
a
special
case.
that
edward
hyde
has
been
found
to
be
so
dangerous,
that
to
continue
employment
with
the
postal
service
is
literally
a
violation
of
the
postal
service's
duties
under
the
act.
now
we
think
that
this
case
can
be
disposed
of
on
the
basis
of
a
very
simple
proposition.
that
there
has
been
no
clear
showing
of
the
kind
of
explicit
conflict
between
the
postal
service's
duties
under
the
statute
and
the
requirements
of
the
award,
which
is
the
kind
of
conflict
that
is
required
in
misco.
let
me
begin
with
the
act.
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
act
consist
initially
of
the
mission
defining
provisions,
which
are
essentially
sections
101
and
403.
those
provisions
tell
the
postal
service
in
effect
to
deliver
the
mail
promptly,
reliably,
and
efficiently,
deliver
the
mail.
the
statute
does
not
contain
any
provisions
which
specify
who
the
postal
service
is
to
employ
to
deliver
the
mail.
it
does
not
specify
any
minimal
qualifications.
and
it
does
not
specify
who
the
postal
service
must
discharge,
with
a
couple
of
very
specific
exceptions
for
striking
and
in
some
instances
for
unlawful
political
activity.
the
statute
leaves
those
decisions
to
the
discretion
of
the
postal
service
with
one
obvious
and
highly
significant
qualification.
the
postal
service
must
exercise
its
right
to
hire
and
discharge
in
a
manner
that
is
consistent
with
its
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
statute
also
provides
that
collective
bargaining
agreements
may
include
provisions
for
resolution
of
adverse
actions
through
binding
third
party
arbitration.
now
that
is
all
that
the
specific
language
of
the
statute
says
on
these
issues.
the
actions
of
the
parties
and
the
arbitrator
are
completely
consistent
with
this
framework.
the
postal
service
and
the
union
negotiated
an
agreement
which
preserves
the
postal
service's
authority
to
manage
the
postal
service,
to
discipline,
and
even
discharge
employees
for
offenses
against
the
mail,
with
the
one
qualification
which
is
provided
for
in
the
statute,
that
any
disputes
over
whether
someone
should
be
discharged
are
to
be
submitted
to
an
arbitrator
for
binding
resolution.
that
is
what
happened
here.
hyde
unquestionably
committed
a
serious
offense.
we
do
not
challenge
that
at
all.
but
the
union
presented
a
very
substantial
case
that
there
had
been
a
material
change
in
circumstances.
that
the
dereliction
of
duty
occurred
during
a
period
in
which
hyde
was
suffering
extreme
emotional
instability,
and
that
he
was
now
in
therapy.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
that
is
true.
i
think
that
it
is
undisputed.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
actually,
for
the
most
part,
we
are
talking
about
junk
mail.
that
is
clear
from
the
criminal
case
file
which
we
lodged
with
the
court.
most
of
the
mail
apparently
was
junk
mail
that
arrived
during
the
christmas
rush.
hyde
could
not
complete
his
route,
put
the
mail
in
the
trunk
of
his
car,
and
his
car
was
stolen.
now
obviously,
he
should
have
reported
that.
he
should
never
have
brought
the
mail
back
home.
but
what
emerged
in
the
criminal
case
and
what
led
ultimately
to
a
very
favorable
report
from
the
probation
department
and
the
sentence
of
probation
was
that
at
this
point
that
the
gambling
had
taken
over
his
life.
that
was
the
accepted
fact.
and
that
is
consistent
with
what
the
literature
reports
about
compulsive
gambling.
that
it
can
lead
to
this
kind
of
distraction
and
dereliction
of
responsibilities
on
the
job.
so
that
was
the
factual
posture
of
the
case.
the
arbitrator
was
then
called
upon
to
determine
whether
there
was
just
cause
for
discharge,
and
with
the
understanding
that
he
could
not
foretell
the
future.
now
i
recognize
that
the
arbitrator
said
that
i
cannot
foretell
the
future
and
that
there
is
a
risk.
but
i
would
submit
that
if
anything
that
those
sentences
which
i
think
are
the
foundation
of
the
government's
entire
case
strengthen
the
argument
for
enforcing
the
award.
because
what
they
show
is
that
this
arbitrator
recognized
the
problem
and
thought
about
it
before
he
made
his
decision.
and
i
think
that
it
is
important
if
we
are
really
going
to
focus
on
exactly
what
the
arbitrator
said
to
emphasize
that
those
sentences
which
establish
that
he
cannot
foretell
the
future
occur
essentially
in
the
middle
of
the
opinion,
which
consists
of
a
general
discussion
of
the
evidence
and
the
issue
before
him.
the
arbitrator's
actual
conclusions
are
on
the
last
page
of
the
award.
and
they
consist
first
of
a
reference
to
another
arbitrator's
decision
for
the
proposition
that
society
must
be
prepared
to
take
a
small
risk,
and
a
conclusion
that
hyde's
emotional
problem
did
not
render
him
unfit
for
further
employment.
and
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
he
was
not
totally
convinced
that
hyde
presently
had
the
ability
to
perform
in
an
acceptable
manner.
now
that
may
be
doubt,
but
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
a
very
small
doubt.
and
the
arbitrator
dealt
with
that
doubt.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
that
is
right.
well,
at
this
point,
i
think
that
he
is
accepting
as
a
given
that
no
one
can
know
for
certain
what
the
future
would
bring.
i
think
that
a
clear
indication
of
how
he
looked
at
the
specific
facts
of
this
case
are
found
in
what
he
said
on
page
23(a).
and
i
think
that
the
award
in
samuel
bingham
which
involved
the
dangers
of
reinstating
an
epileptic
employee
in
a
manufacturing
situation
are
important.
because
that
is
the
analogy,
as
i
see
it,
that
the
arbitrator
found
here.
and
the
cone
award
speaks
in
terms
of
very
small
risks
because
of
the
management
options
and
the
availability
of
treatment.
that
i
think
is
the
fairest
construction
of
this
award.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
let
me
respond
to
that
question,
which
i
think
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
case
in
this
manner.
if
we
had
a
crystal
ball
that
we
could
peer
into
and
we
could
see
that
if
hyde
were
placed
back
on
the
job
that
a
significant
amount
of
mail
would
be
placed
in
the
trunk
of
his
car
or
otherwise
mishandled,
yes,
this
award
would
violate
public
policy.
the
problem
is
that
obviously
we
cannot
foretell
the
future,
which
is
exactly
what
the
arbitrator
recognized.
because
we
are
dealing
with
uncertainty,
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
prohibits
the
employment
of
individuals
who
may
be
a
greater
risk
than
the
average
employee,
or
in
this
case
the
next
employee
hired
off
the
employment
register.
i
do
not
think
that
that
statute
creates
any
prohibition
against
the
employment
of
high
risk
employees.
now
it
could
be
argued,
i
suppose,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
that
that
would
be
a
good
idea,
to
prohibit
the
employment
of
high
risk
employees
in
the
postal
service.
but
the
fact
is
that
congress
did
not
do
that,
and
that
is
absolutely
clear
from
the
legislative
history.
congress
intended
these
matters
to
be
decided
by
arbitrators.
now
frankly,
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
more
mishandling
of
the
mail
now
than
there
was
before
the
postal
reorganization
act
when
the
postal
service
had
the
authority
to
do
exactly
what
it
is
seeking
to
do
here,
to
walk
away
from
an
arbitration
award
on
the
ground
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
its
statutory
responsibilities.
prior
to
1970,
the
old
post
office
department
pursuant
to
executive
order
had
the
authority
to
conduct
advisory
arbitrations
in
its
dealings
with
unions.
but
the
department
always
retained
the
authority
to
overturn
an
award
for
whatever
reason
that
it
chose.
and
what
congress
found,
and
this
was
after
extensive
studies
of
the
post
office
department,
is
that
that
system
did
not
work.
it
led
to
extremely
low
morale,
low
productivity,
and
tremendous
frustration
among
the
workers,
which
actually
culminated
in
1970
in
a
nationwide
postal
strike.
that
was
the
context
in
which
congress
reorganized
the
postal
service.
i
think
that
it
would
be
completely
inconsistent
with
congressional
intent
to
attribute
to
congress
a
purpose
which
is
not
stated
anywhere
in
the
language
of
the
statute
to
give
either
management
or
the
courts
the
authority
to
in
effect
substitute
their
judgment
for
an
arbitrator's
that
the
risks
involved
in
reinstating
an
employee
are
too
great.
this
public
policy
exception
to
the
enforcement
of
arbitration
awards
has
existed
for
a
long
time.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
no,
no.
we
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
public
policy
doctrine
in
the
post
office.
but
i
think
that
that
touches
on
an
important
point
which
goes
to
the
posture
of
this
appeal.
in
misco
obviously,
in
the
last
footnote
of
the
court's
opinion,
the
court
left
open
the
question
of
whether
the
public
policy
doctrine
is
limited
as
the
d.c.
circuit
saw
it
to
violations
of
positive
law.
now
the
government
has
told
us
in
its
brief
that
that
question,
which
was
left
open
in
the
footnote,
is
not
raised
here,
that
the
court
does
not
have
to
look
at
it.
because
it
sees
this
case
as
involving
nothing
more
than
a
violation
of
positive
law.
so
as
i
see
this
case,
if
there
is
no
violation
of
the
statute
per
se,
that
is
the
end
of
this
appeal.
there
is
no
further
inquiry
into
any
possible
common
law
theory
because
i
do
not
see
the
government
raising
it.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
that
goes
to
how
the
statute
is
interpreted.
i
have
suggested
that
even
that
statement
would
not
be
the
basis
for
finding
a
conflict
between
the
statute
and
the
award.
i
am
prepared
in
the
limited
time
that
i
have
available--
mr.
keith
e.
secular
--that
is
right.
as
a
second
position,
i
would
grant
that
if
an
arbitrator
made
a
finding
like
that,
a
public
policy
inquiry
could
be
generated.
now
let
me
state
before
i
go
any
further
that
if
this
arbitrator
had
made
that
finding,
i
do
not
see
how
under
our
contract
that
the
employee
would
have
been
reinstated.
i
think
that
it
is
entirely
unfair
to
assume
that
postal
arbitrators
exercising
their
functions
under
a
statutory
scheme
are
putting
back
to
work
people
who
they
find
pose
a
high
risk
to
the
security
of
the
mail.
that
is
not
happening,
and
there
is
no
reason
for
it
to
happen
under
a
just
cause
provision.
what
should
happen
ideally
if
the
postal
service
feels
that
someone
has
a
psychological
problem
and
his
treatment
is
not
sufficiently
effective
to
reduce
the
risks
of
further
misconduct,
that
it
should
pose
that
question
to
the
arbitrator.
the
regulations
that
we
have
cited,
which
are
used
day
to
day
in
the
postal
service,
permit
the
postal
service
to
have
an
employee
examined
to
generate
psychiatric
reports.
the
postal
service
knows
how
to
build
a
case
that
an
employee
is
unfit
for
further
employment
because
of
a
psychological
impairment.
the
union
can
contest
that.
and
if
the
case
is
posed
to
the
arbitrator
that
way,
the
arbitrator
will
make
findings.
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
is
that
the
postal
service
never
really
made
that
case
here.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
i
think
that
it
can
be
in
the
postal
service.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
i
think
that
the
arbitrator
will
not
interpret
or
does
not
have
to
say
that
just
cause
means
that
i
will
read
the
statute.
but
i
think
that
the
factual
inquiry
which
is
rather
basic,
whether
an
employee
is
going
to
mishandle
the
mail,
is
essentially
the
same.
so
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
arbitrator
is
deciding
the
case
under
a
just
cause
standard
or
under
a
statutory
standard.
if
there
is
a
difference,
and
if
it
is
the
kind
of
difference
which
justifies
overturning
the
award
here,
i
am
afraid
that
you
are
setting
the
threshold
of
risk
so
low
that
virtually
any
case
involving
misconduct
can
be
brought
into
the
courts
for
a
second
look.
as
i
see
it,
what
the
postal
service
envisions
is
a
bifurcated
process,
whereby
first
the
arbitrator
plays
the
role
of
something
akin
to
an
insurance
actuary
and
figures
out
what
the
statistical
likelihood
that
this
fellow
will
commit
further
misconduct
is.
and
then
management
and
then
the
courts
pass
judgment
on
whether
that
risk
is
acceptable.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
that
is
right.
there
is
no
question
that
looking
at
this
case
retrospectively
that
hyde
committed
an
offense
involving
the
security
of
the
mail.
but
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
that
statute,
18
usc
1703,
which
applies
exclusively
to
employees
and
officers
of
the
postal
service,
and
they
are
the
only
ones
who
can
be
convicted
of
that
statute,
does
not
provide
for
loss
of
employment
as
a
sanction.
so
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
point
is
exactly
what
then
circuit
judge
marshall
said
in
otis
elevator
in
1963.
that
the
policy
that
is
embodied
in
that
criminal
statute
was
vindicated
in
precisely
the
manner
that
congress
intended,
by
a
criminal
conviction
and
by
the
imposition
of
a
criminal
penalty.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
there
are
actually
some
statutes
which
do
provide
for
loss
of
federal
employment,
and
the
striker
example
is
one
key
example
here.
but
obviously,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
my
only
point
was
a
limited
one.
that
for
purposes
of
a
misco
analysis,
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
appropriate
to
rely
on
the
criminal
statute
here.
because
that
policy
and
this
award
cannot
be
said
to
be
in
conflict.
that
policy
was
wholly
vindicated.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
um...
i
think
the
public
policy,
i
would
suggest
that
the
criminal
statutes
are
not
a
basis
for
that
kind
of
public
policy
inquiry.
we
do
acknowledge
that
the
postal
reorganization
act
is
a
basis
for
the
inquiry.
and
i
did
not
read
the
government's
brief
as
suggesting
anything
more
than
that.
the
policy
that
it
is
looking
to
at
least
in
the
brief
is
the
policy
that
emanates
from
the
postal
reorganization
act
itself.
and
the
theory,
as
i
stated
before,
is
a
limited
theory,
that
the
act
imposes
on
management
certain
duties,
and
that
this
award
requires
management
to
violate
those
duties.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
that
is
correct.
obviously,
the
standard
of
proof
under
a
criminal
statute
is
higher.
so
that
an
arbitrator
could
decide
that
even
if
the
proof
did
not
rise
to
the
level
that
a
man
could
be
convicted
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
standard,
that
there
was
still
sufficient
reason
to
discharge
the
employee.
i
would
like
to
respond
now
to
certain
specific
contentions
that
the
postal
service
advanced
in
its
reply
brief.
the
government
makes
reference
to
cases
which
involve
contracts
which
have
been
held
to
violate
public
policy,
because
of
their
tendency
to
induce
improper
conduct.
and
that
perspective,
i
think,
underlies
the
argument
that
enforcement
of
this
award
may
encourage
misconduct
by
hyde's
coworkers.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
award
or
of
the
union's
position.
the
beginning
of
the
award
makes
clear
that
the
union
acknowledged
throughout
that
delay
of
the
mail
is
improper
and
that
it
is
cause
for
discipline,
and
that
it
could
be
the
basis
for
discharge.
the
union's
argument
here
was
that
there
was
a
change
in
circumstances,
a
material
change
in
circumstances,
based
on
the
fact
that
hyde
is
now
being
treated.
i
do
not
see
how
by
any
rational
calculus,
that
whatever
benefits
a
reasonable
employee
might
determine
he
would
derive
from
delaying
the
mail,
and
i
do
not
know
what
they
are,
would
not
be
outweighed
by
the
costs
recognized
by
this
award,
which
include
criminal
conviction,
a
suspension
of
almost
one
year
in
length
without
pay,
and
the
possibility
of
discharge,
if
he
is
unable
to
convince
the
arbitrator
that
there
are
grounds
for
reinstatement
based
on
mitigating
circumstances.
in
addition,
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
at
this
point
that
to
assert
that
the
award
may
encourage
others,
may
set
a
bad
example
for
other
employees,
is
in
misco's
language
sheer
speculation.
because
there
has
been
no
evidence
no
way
or
the
other
on
that
issue,
none
presented
to
the
arbitrator
and
none
presented
to
the
court
below.
the
reply
brief
also
makes
reference
to
the
balancing
test
which
was
enunciated
as
an
element
in
a
public
policy
inquiry.
i
just
want
to
state
the
position
that
under
the
town
of
newton
v.
rumery,
we
would
take
the
position
that
in
any
case
involving
the
public
policy
doctrine
that
a
balance
of
the
interests
at
stake
is
appropriate
and
necessary.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
i
think
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case
given
the
way
that
it
has
been
postulated.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
yes.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
i
used
the
crystal
ball
example
before.
if
we
could
predict
the
future
with
certainty,
and
we
would
know
that
enforcing
this
award
would
result
in
a
delay
of
the
mail.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
i
would
agree
with
that
proposition
in
the
abstract.
i
would
suggest
though
that
it
is
unrealistic
that
a
discipline
case
is
ever
going
to
come
before
the
court
in
that
posture.
i
can
envision
work
rule
cases
where
the
arbitrator
commands
management
or
the
postal
service
to
operate
in
a
certain
way
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
we
gave
a
rather
silly
example
in
our
brief.
suppose
an
arbitrator
found
that
the
entire
postal
service
had
to
shut
down
in
the
summer
months,
so
that
letter
carriers
could
have
a
vacation.
well,
that
would
be
precisely
the
kind
of
hypothetical
that
justice
scalia
proposed.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
yes.
the
d.c.
circuit
has
taken
the
so-called
narrow
view.
and
i
agree
that
there
are
other
courts
of
appeals
which
have
adopted
a
broader
formulation.
and
that
this
court
has
not
resolved
the
issue,
my
only
point.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
i
do
not
see
how
a
possibility
of
a
theory
based
on
the
broader
view
of
the
public
policy
doctrine
helps
the
government
here.
i
agree
with
that
government.
this
is
not
the
case
in
which
to
address
that
issue.
because
the
argument
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
compliance
with
this
award
would
be
a
violation
of
management's
statutory
duties.
so
i
see
this
case
as
requiring
a
finding
of
a
direct
conflict
between
the
statute
and
the
award.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
well,
i
assume
that
it
would
be
shown
initially
to
management.
and
if
there
were
a
dispute,
that
would
be
resolved
through
the
grievance
procedure.
mr.
keith
e.
secular
that
is
right.
i
have
nothing
further.
