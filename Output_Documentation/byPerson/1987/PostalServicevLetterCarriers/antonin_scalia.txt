was
any
of
that
junk
mail,
or
was
it
all
good
mail,
i
mean
if
it
was
junk
mail--
justice
scalia
before
you
do,
it
really
might
help
both
the
employer
and
the
union
in
those
situations
as
well
as
help
the
courts
if
we
made
it
pretty
clear,
as
i
thought
that
we
had
done
in
misco,
what
the
lines
are.
so
that
the
employer
will
very
well
know
when
he
concedes
something
like
this
what
he
is
getting
himself
into.
do
you
not
think
that
would
be
helpful,
i
mean
you
are
not
urging
us
that
just
because
employers
typically
throw
in
the
towel
and
say,
well,
i
will
fight
that
when
it
comes,
that
we
have
to
decide
these
things
case
by
case
forever?
justice
scalia
i
thought
that
we
just
had
a
case
that
is
very
much
like
this.
justice
scalia
maybe
not,
but
have
we
not
required
a
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
has
been
given
that
call
that
is
so
outrageous
that
no
reasonable
person
could
come
to
it.
i
mean
are
you
arguing
that
the
arbitrator
could
not
possibly
have
thought
that
the
chances
of
rehabilitation
outweighed
the
chances
of
any
impairment?
justice
scalia
what
is
the
rule
then,
that
whenever
any
postal
service
employee
has
committed
a
crime
involving
the
mails
that
he
must
be
dismissed?
justice
scalia
no
risk,
zero
risk.
you
cannot
make
that
finding
for
any
postal
employee.
justice
scalia
well,
did
he
not
make
that
finding
here,
undue
in
the
sense
of
the
policy
of
trying
to
rehabilitate
people?
justice
scalia
given
those
findings,
you
could
not
put
him
in
a
job
where
he
could
not
steal
mail,
you
really
say
that
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
accept
his
findings
without
violating
the
law?
justice
scalia
i
cannot
believe.
it
is
a
big
operation,
the
post
office.
that
there
is
not
some
place
that
you
could
put
this
man,
who
had
been
there
for
thirty
years
with
a
clean
record
before
this
happened.
justice
scalia
to
prevent
that?
justice
scalia
it
has
to
command
it,
it
would
not
be
enough
if
no
reasonable
person
could
believe
other
than
it
would
result
in
illegal
conduct?
give
us
a
break.
it
has
to
command
illegal
conduct?
justice
scalia
if
a
reasonable
person
would
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
result
in
the
violation
of
a
statute,
surely,
that
would
be
enough,
would
it
not,
if
that
is
the
only
conclusion
that
a
reasonable
person
could
draw?
