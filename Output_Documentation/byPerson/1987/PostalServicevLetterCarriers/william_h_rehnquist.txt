mr.
nager,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nager.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
secular.
chief

rehnquist
mr.
secular,
at
page
22(a)
of
the
award,
of
the
arbitrator's
opinion,
it
says,
"the
arbitrator
is
not
able
to
foretell
what
the
future
prospects
of
a
grievance
rehabilitation
may
yield.
"
"now
that
is
not
saying
that
there
is
a
tiny
doubt
in
my
mind.
"
"he
is
saying
i
just
do
not
know,
as
i
read
it.
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
are
not
saying
that
it
does
not
have
any
application
in
post
office
matters,
are
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
do
have
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
criminal
offense.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
is
usual
punishment
that
congress
provides
for
the
violation
of
a
criminal
statute.
either
a
term
on
probation,
or
in
prison,
or
a
fine.
it
does
not
usually
go
on
to
specify
that
if
you
are
a
federal
employee
and
have
done
this,
you
lose
your
job.
that
is
left
to
other
authorities
to
decide.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
could
say
the
same
of
someone
who
was
convicted
of
theft
from
the
mails.
that
the
policy
of
the
statute
prohibiting
theft
was
fully
vindicated
when
he
was
sent
to
prison
for
two
years
and
fined
$10,000.
and
i
daresay
that
the
reaction
of
most
courts
would
be
quite
different
in
that
case
to
the
one
that
you
suggest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
secular.

of
the

to
announce
the
