justice
white
well,
mr.
nager,
i
do
not
think
that
your
opposition
challenges
the
existence
of
a
public
policy
exception.
the
real
question
is
does
the
public
policy
exception
warrant
overturning
the
particular
arbitrator's
decision
in
this
case.
justice
white
do
i
understand
from
what
you
say
that
it
would
have
been
illegal
for
the
postal
department
to
have
complied
with
this
arbitration
award?
justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
did
not
think
that
it
violated
any
statute.
justice
white
it
was
not
required
in
misco
either.
justice
white
i
thought
that
you
said
that
it
would
have
been
illegal,
illegal
for
the
postal
service
to
rehire
this
fellow.
justice
white
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
rejected
that
notion,
i
think.
justice
white
i
thought
that
you
agreed
that
the
arbitrator
would
make
decisions
like
this.
justice
white
i
know,
but
that
is
up
to
him
to
decide
whether
there
was
cause
for
the
discharge.
justice
white
that
is
not
only
making
these
findings,
but
deciding
whether...
construing
the
word
cause
in
the
contract.
justice
white
and
that
is
his
job,
and
he
did
it.
justice
white
would
you
be
here
if
he
had
not
been
a
compulsive
gambler,
but
he
just
had
been
negligent,
he
just
was
a
lousy
postal
service
man?
justice
white
well,
he
certainly
would
have
these
3500
letters
undelivered
which
would
have
been
a
crime.
justice
white
in
the
findings
in
this
case,
there
is
no
causal
connection
between
his
gambling
and
the
non-delivery.
justice
white
you
are
bound
by
some
of
them,
and
you
do
not
want
to
be
bound
by
some
others.
justice
white
well,
they
can
happen,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
the
union
would
lie
down
for
having
him
reinstated
in
some
other
job
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
a
risk
of
his
repeating
his
conduct.
justice
white
maybe
we
ought
to
dismiss
the
case
as
improvidently
granted
then.
justice
white
the
postal
service
says
that
it
would
have
been
illegal
for
them
to
retain
this
man
on
the
payroll.
justice
white
do
i
understand
that
you
say
that
the
public
policy
exception
is
limited
as
to
the
circumstances
that
the
court
of
appeals
stated,
that
the
award
must
actually
command
illegal
conduct?
justice
white
that
is
your
standard
for
the
public
policy
exception?
justice
white
but
do
you
not
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
adopted
in
several
cases
the
standard
that
there
is
no
violation
of
public
policy
in
enforcing
an
award,
unless
the
award
orders
illegal
conduct?
justice
white
but
what
if
it
is
not
limited
to
commanding
illegal
conduct?
