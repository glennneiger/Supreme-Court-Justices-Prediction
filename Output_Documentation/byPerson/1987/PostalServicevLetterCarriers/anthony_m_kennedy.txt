justice
kennedy
it
just
seems
to
me
that
your
rule
is
really
going
to
displace
the
arbitrator's
judgment
in
most
cases
of
discharge
for
wrongful
acts.
if
an
employee
fights
a
lot,
if
he
is
often
late,
he
is
an
alcoholic.
we
are
just
not
use
to
making
a
finding
that
there
is
a
zero
risk
or
that
there
is
an
insignificant
risk
that
this
will
reoccur.
and
clinical
psychologists
certainly
will
not
make
that
finding
with
reference
to
alcoholics,
unless
you
have
a
two
year
period
like
we
do
for
pilots.
justice
kennedy
what
was
your
answer
with
respect
to
the
question
about
theft
from
the
mails?
justice
kennedy
my
point
is
that
realistically
that
finding
simply
cannot
be
made,
can
it?
justice
kennedy
and
did
that
criminal
proceeding
require
scienter,
does
the
statute
require
an
intent
to
violate?
justice
kennedy
my
reading
is
that
gross
negligence
would
suffice
for
a
violation.
justice
kennedy
maybe
you
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
do
this,
but
can
you
tell
me,
is
this
an
unusual
statement
of
mission,
or
does
every
agency
have
a
statement
that
its
primary
mission
is
to
perform
certain
functions?
justice
kennedy
because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
are
saying
is,
as
we
go
through
the
statutes,
that
we
could
find
this
in
every
agency
in
the
government.
maybe
i
am
wrong.
justice
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
you
would
not
be
here
if
the
order
said
that
he
is
reinstated
to
his
previous
position,
subject
to
the
conditions?
justice
kennedy
does
the
case
turn
on
that?
justice
kennedy
suppose
the
arbitrator
said
that
there
was
a
high
risk
of
recurrence?
justice
kennedy
but
we
interpret
the
statute,
i
take
it?
justice
kennedy
but
you
are
saying
that
just
cause
will
always
be
synonymous
with
the
public
policy?
justice
kennedy
but
that
is
up
to
the
arbitrator,
i
take
it?
