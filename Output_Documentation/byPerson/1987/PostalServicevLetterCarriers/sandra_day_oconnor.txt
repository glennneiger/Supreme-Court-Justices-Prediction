justice
o'connor
mr.
nager,
i
take
it
that
there
has
been
a
stay
entered,
so
that
this
employee
has
not
been
back
on
the
job?
justice
o'connor
and
the
case
is
not
moot,
because
the
employee
still
wants
to
return
to
being
a
letter
carrier?
justice
o'connor
mr.
nager,
in
this
case,
there
is
a
statute
that
provides
that
delivery
of
the
mail
is
the
highest
priority
of
the
postal
service.
justice
o'connor
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
statutes
saying
that
the
postal
service
will
engage
in
collective
bargaining,
and
there
are
statutes
reflecting
that
rehabilitation
is
also
appropriate
for
the
employer
to
consider.
now
is
it
only
where
there
is
a
statute
that
says
that
one
has
the
highest
priority
that
it
would
be
justifiable
then
to
rely
on
that
as
the
public
policy?
justice
o'connor
and
if
there
were
not
such
language?
justice
o'connor
with
competing
public
policies?
justice
o'connor
of
course,
that
mandate
if
broadly
read
could
certainly
override
anything.
i
mean
it
delays
the
mail
to
go
to
arbitration.
it
would
be
more
efficient
to
let
the
post
office
to
dismiss
the
employee
on
the
spot.
so
you
have
got
to
have
some
line
drawing
within
the
line
drawing.
justice
o'connor
but
how
about
an
employee
who
is
just
slow,
just
not
very
efficient;
he
did
not
steal
the
mail,
but
the
employee
just
moved
slowly?
justice
o'connor
here
the
arbitrator's
findings,
if
i
remember
correctly,
were
to
the
effect
that
the
arbitrator
is
not
totally
persuaded
that
the
employee
presently
has
the
emotional
ability
to
perform
the
work
in
an
acceptable
manner.
and
the
arbitrator
is
not
able
to
foretell
what
the
future
prospects
of
his
rehabilitation
may
yield.
and
you
say
that
those
findings
are
not
sufficient.
justice
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
agreed
with
you,
what
is
the
remedy,
is
it
to
remand
to
the
arbitrator
for
a
more
appropriate
remedy
or
new
findings?
justice
o'connor
does
not
reinstatement
require
reinstatement
to
that
job
or
an
equivalent
one,
and
is
not
this
person
a
letter
carrier?
justice
o'connor
so
he
has
got
to
go
back
into
a
letter
carrier's
position
that
is
equivalent,
that
position
of
an
equivalent
one.
justice
o'connor
you
are
saying
that
the
post
office
can
just
keep
him
on
the
payroll
and
not
give
him
any
duties.
justice
o'connor
i
thought
that
the
evidence
showed
that
some
of
these
pieces
of
mail
found
in
his
personal
automobile
had
been
there
for
a
year.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
one
day
delay
here.
justice
o'connor
i
mean
this
was
an
extended
period
of
time,
and
we
are
not
talking
about
junk
mail.
justice
o'connor
yes.
but
here,
you
do
have
a
statute
placing
highest
priority
on
the
security
of
the
mail
and
the
prompt
delivery.
and
that
might
mean
that
in
the
face
of
such
an
uncertain
finding
by
the
arbitrator,
that
this
is
one
of
those
instances
in
which
the
judiciary
can
bring
to
bear
its
judgment.
