mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
that
court
held
that
the
postal
service
must
comply
with
an
arbitration
award
that
orders
to
reinstate
to
a
letter
carrier
position
an
individual
who
has
been
criminally
convicted
of
failing
to
deliver
over
3500
pieces
of
mail,
and
who
an
arbitrator
found
posed
a
risk
of
again
delaying
the
mail
in
the
future.
we
have
sought
review
by
this
court,
because
we
believe
that
the
postal
service
cannot
comply
with
the
decision
below
without
defaulting
upon
its
statutory
obligations
to
ensure
that
the
mail
is
reliability
delivered.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
relatively
simple.
in
june
of
1984,
postal
inspectors
made
a
lawful
search
of
the
personal
automobile
of
the
grievant
in
this
case,
mr.
edward
hyde.
in
the
course
of
that
search,
they
found
over
3500
pieces
of
mail
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car.
some
of
the
mail
contained
united
states
treasury
checks,
and
some
of
those
checks
were
dated
april
1,
1983
indicating
that
the
mail
had
been
delayed,
some
of
the
pieces
of
the
mail
had
been
delayed
at
least
a
year
and
a
half.
the
postal
service
immediately
had
mr.
hyde
arrested,
and
charged
him
with
unlawful
possession
and
unlawful
delay
of
the
mails
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--justice
stevens,
i
really
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
his
route
was
in
long
island,
new
york,
in
jericho,
new
york,
and
i
really
do
not
know
how
many
houses
that
covered.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
think
that
is
probably
right,
but
the
record
does
not
reflect
it,
and
i
just
do
not
know.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
u.s.
treasury
checks,
i
doubt
were
junk
mail.
the
postal
service
charged
mr.
hyde
with
unlawful
possession
of
the
mail
and
unlawful
delay
of
the
mail.
and
he
pled
guilty
to
the
latter
offense,
and
was
sentenced
to
eighteen
months
probation,
a
condition
of
which
that
he
enter
a
complete
rehabilitation
program
for
compulsive
gamblers.
now
because
of
his
criminal
dereliction
of
duties,
the
postal
service
sought
to
discharge
mr.
hyde.
the
respondent,
the
national
association
of
letter
carriers,
filed
a
grievance
on
mr.
hyde's
behalf
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
the
postal
service
and
the
letter
carriers
have
entered
into.
and
they
argue
that
the
postal
service
was
without
just
cause
to
discharge
mr.
hyde,
and
that
he
should
be
reinstated
to
his
letter
carrier
position.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes,
justice
o'connor.
the
solicitor
general
sought
a
stay
from
the
chief
justice
of
the
d.c.
circuit's
mandate.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes,
that
is
right.
and
in
addition,
i
am
sure
that
the
union
would
file
a
grievance
seeking
back
pay
from
the
date
which
the
postal
service
was
supposed
to
start
complying
with
the
arbitration
order.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
justice
blackmun,
the
record
does
not
reflect
it.
i
have
speculated
on
it.
the
arbitrator
found
that
his
failure
to
deliver
the
mail
was
attributable
to
his
compulsive
gambling
problem.
he
did
not
say
how
it
led
to
his
failure
to
deliver
the
mail.
and
the
postal
service's
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
letter
carriers
does
not
provide
and
in
fact
prohibits
use
of
transcripts
during
the
arbitral
proceeding.
so
there
is
no
record
of
testimony
on
that
point.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no.
he
pled
guilty
to
unlawful
delay.
he
was
charged
with
unlawful
possession,
but
he
was
not
charged
with
stealing
the
mail.
an
arbitrator
convened
a
hearing
with
respect
to
the
grievance,
and
ruled
in
respondent's
favor
for
mr.
hyde.
the
arbitrator
found
that
mr.
hyde
had
in
fact
unlawfully
delayed
the
mails,
but
he
also
found
that
it
was
attributable
to
what
he
characterized
as
the
grievant's
mental
disease,
his
affliction
for
compulsive
gambling.
he
thus
saw
his
own
task
as
what
he
termed
balancing
the
needs
of
society,
the
needs
of
the
mentally
ill,
and
the
needs
of
the
employee.
and
he
identified
the
differentiating
factor
in
that
balance
what
he
called
and
i
quote,
"the
possibility
of
rehabilitation".
he
then
found
that
he
did
not
know
what
the
future
prospects
of
rehabilitation
were
for
mr.
hyde.
and
indeed,
this
was
a
tough
decision
for
him,
because
he
saw
that
there
was
a
threat
of
recurrence
of
the
misconduct.
but
in
that
balance
where
there
was
a
possibility
of
rehabilitation,
he
concluded
that
this
is
not
a
risk
free
society.
and
thus,
it
is
the
postal
service
and
the
postal
service's
patrons
who
should
bear
the
risk
of
that
future
misconduct
while
there
was
a
reasonable
hope
of
rehabilitation
for
mr.
hyde.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
think
that
it
is
clearly
the
case
where
congress
has
indicated
what
the
highest
priority
is
among
several
competing
statutes.
that
the
statute
congress
has
indicated
has
the
highest
priority
should
prevail.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
if
there
were
not
such
language,
i
think
that
the
court
would,
as
it
does
in
every
case
in
which
it
is
faced
with
statutes.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
correct.
in
cases
in
which
there
were
competing
public
policies,
the
court
would
have
to
reconcile
those
statutes,
as
it
does
in
any
case
where
there
are
statutes
that
point
in
different
directions.
that,
of
course,
is
not
this
case.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it
does,
justice
brennan.
and
we
have
tried
to
make
it
as
clear
as
we
can
in
our
brief
that
we
are
not
seeking
in
any
way
to
destabilize
the
labor-arbitration
process.
the
postal
service
is
committed
to
its
labor-arbitration
process.
last
year,
for
example,
it
had
45,000
grievances,
7500
of
which--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes,
as
this
court
has
recognized.
and
we
believe
that
the--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that
is
correct.
but
let
me
address
why
it
is
so
important
that
the
court
not
only
recognize
that
it
pay
attention
to
the
public
policy
exception.
the
argument
in
this
case
is
that
somehow
allowing
a
public
law
to
trump
an
arbitration
decision
would
somehow
destabilize
the
arbitration
process.
but
quite
the
opposite
is
true.
the
court
has
to
remember
how
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
negotiated,
and
how
arbitration
provisions
get
put
into
collective
bargaining
agreements.
typically,
in
a
collective
bargaining
context,
an
employer
and
a
union
will
have
approximately
ninety
days
upon
which
to
agree.
if
an
agreement
is
about
to
expire,
they
will
give
notice
ninety
days
before
the
expiration
of
the
agreement.
and
the
union
will
come
forward
with
a
series
of
demands
on
numerous
topics
that
they
would
like
the
employer
to
agree
to.
and
the
employer
will
respond
to
those
demands.
and
over
the
course
of
ninety
days,
they
will
deal
with
provisions
dealing
with
the
various
economics
of
their
relationships,
and
the
various
work
rules
that
govern
their
relationships.
every
one
of
those
proposals
can
and
oftentimes
do
have
legal
ambiguities
in
them.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
if
the
parties
had
to
resolve
every
legal
ambiguity,
just
as
they
had
to
resolve
every
contractual
ambiguity,
before
they
entered
into
the
contract,
they
would
never
be
able
to
enter
into
a
contract
in
the
first
place.
the
public
policy
exception
simply
greases
the
wheel,
so
to
speak,
of
the
collective
bargaining
process.
it
allows
the
parties
to
reach
agreement
on
general
contract
language
like
a
just
clause
provision.
and
if
the
language
is
subsequently
interpreted
in
a
way
that
one
or
the
other
party
thinks
would
put
them
in
violation
of
public
law,
if
they
had
to
comply
with
it,
they
have
the
freedom
to
go
to
federal
court
and
to
seek
to
have
that
provision
declared
unlawful.
this
court's
decision
in
kaiser
steel
v.
mullins
where
the
united
mine
workers
and
the
steel
company
had
agreed
to
contribute
to
the
umw's
pension
plans
for
every
ton
of
coal
that
the
non-umw
steel
producer
sold
to
kaiser.
kaiser
entered
into
that
agreement.
and
in
fact,
it
had
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
with
respect
to
an
identical
provision
under
previous
agreements.
it
agreed
to
the
provision,
and
then
it
refused
to
contribute
to
the
pension
plans.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
think
that
is
correct,
justice
white,
and
let
me
turn
to
that.
i
was
just
trying
to
address
justice
brennan's
question
about
why
the
public
policy
exception
existed
and
how
broad
or
narrow
it
should
be.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
we
have
not
disputed
that
in
this
case.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
correct.
and
we
tried
to
brief
the
case
that
way.
we
said
by
hypothesis
we
assume
and
we
have
agreed
to
this
provision.
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
our
statutory
obligations
preclude
us
from
complying
with
it.
and
the
reason
why
i
say
that
that
hypothesis
is
a
realistic
one
is
not
just
because
of
the
contract
and
the
reasonableness
or
unreasonableness
of
the
arbitrator's
award,
but
because
that
is
the
nature
of
collective
bargaining
and
the
types
of
situations
that
employers
and
unions
find
themselves
in
having
to
agree
to
ambiguous
or
unambiguous
provisions
on
the
recognition
that
either
one
of
them
can
subsequently
go
to
court
and
point
out
that
that
provision
is
inconsistent
with
public
law.
because
th
employer...
it
may
not
be
important
to
the
employer,
even
if
it
is
illegal.
and
it
may
be
very
important
to
the
union.
and
the
employer
does
not
want
to
end
up
having
a
strike
over
whether
or
not
the
provision
is
legal
or
illegal.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
white,
and
let
me
turn
to
why
that
is
the
case.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
we
think
that
it
is
fundamentally
different
from
this
case.
but
to
answer
your
question,
we
do
think
that
clearer
roles
would
be
helpful
to
everyone.
we
are
saying
that
the
misco
analysis
applies
in
full
force
if
there
is
a
well
defined
and
dominant
public
policy
in
existing
law
and
legal
precedent
which
is
the
standard
that
the
court
used
in
misco.
and
if
the
arbitration
award
compromises
or
conflicts
with
that
well
defined
and
dominant
public
policy,
then
the
award
is
unenforceable.
that
is
the
legal
standard
that
we
are
asking
for.
the
question
in
this
case,
as
justice
white
has
asked,
is
what
is
the
public
policy
and
how
does
it
conflict.
and
the
public
policy
in
this
case,
we
would
submit,
which
the
respondents
have
conceded,
is
the
public's
interest
and
congress'
mandate
that
the
mails
be
maintained,
secure,
and
reliably
delivered.
i
think
that
it
goes
without
saying
that
it
is
a
fundamental
premise
of
our
entire
economic
and
political
system
that
the
mails
will
be
reliably
and
securely
delivered.
the
right
to
establish
a
post
office
and
maintain
it
is
recognized
in
the
constitution.
the
government
every
day
relies
on
the
sanctity
and
integrity
of
the
mails
to
ensure
that
the
taxes
are
collected,
and
that
benefit
checks
are
delivered
to
the
needy.
businesses
rely
on
the
sanctity
and
integrity
of
the
mails
every
day
to
ensure
that
their
business
transactions
are
timely
conducted.
and
the
courts
rely
on
the
sanctity
and
integrity
of
the
mails
to
ensure
the
safe
conduct
of
judicial
business.
and
in
recognition
of
that
public
interest,
congress
has
enacted
a
series
of
statutes,
the
first
of
which
grants
a
limited
public
monopoly
to
the
postal
service.
it
mandates
that
the
postal
service
shall
ensure
the
prompt,
reliable,
and
efficient
delivery
of
the
mail.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
o'connor.
and
that
is
why
we
have
not
suggested
that
the
language
of
section
101(a)
of
title
39
which
requires
the
post
office
to
ensure
a
prompt,
reliable,
and
efficient
delivery
of
the
mail
by
itself
establishes
not
only
the
public
policy
which
it
does,
but
also
the
dominance
and
definition
that
this
court
in
grace
and
misco
said
was
necessary.
the
definition
and
the
dominance
which
comes
from
section
410(b)
and
from
18
u.s.c.
1701,
which
410(b)
makes
applicable
to
the
postal
service
in
conjunction
with
101(a)
mandates
that
the
postal
service
preserve
the
security
and
sanctity
of
the
mails
in
preventing
the
kinds
of
actions
by
its
own
employers
that
mr.
hyde
engaged
in
in
this
case
in
the
unlawful
delay
of
the
mail.
we
have
not
argued
that
any
award
which
the
postal
service
thinks
isolated
and
by
itself
might--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that
is
an
act
of
misfeasance
by
the
employee,
but
it
is
not
an
act
of
statutory
malfeasance.
it
is
not
something
that
we
read
the
statute
as
prohibiting
the
postal
service
from
tolerating.
we
do
read
the
statute
as
prohibiting
the
postal
service
from
tolerating
the
employment
of
an
individual
who
it
knows
there
is
a
reason
to
believe
that
that
person
will
intentionally
not
delay
the
mail
again
in
the
future.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
postal
service
looked
at
the
statute
and
said
that
in
order...
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
order
for
us
to
agree
not
to
enforce
this
arbitration
award
that
we
have
to
find
a
provision
in
the
statute
which
says
in
its
terms
that
the
postal
service
cannot
employ
an
individual
who
has
committed
this
act
or
who
presents
a
threat
to
the
postal
service.
but
that
specificity
has
never
been
required
by
this
court.
it
was
not
required
by
the
court,
for
example,
in
hurd
v.
hodge
where
the
court
read
the
equal
protection.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it
was
not
required
in
misco.
it
was
not
required
in
hurd
v.
hodge.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
how
we
read
our
own
statutory
obligations,
to
preclude
us
from
employing
an
individual.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
it
did,
we
think
incorrectly.
but
the
reason
that
it
did
was
that
it
said
that
there
has
to
be
specific
statutory
language
that
in
terms
precludes
the
reinstatement
of
this
individual.
but
this
court
has
never
required
in
order
to
refuse
to
enforce
an
arbitration
award
that
degree
of
specificity
in
statutory
language,
take
for
example--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no,
we
are
not
arguing
that
at
all.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
the
letter
carrier
position
in
the
postal
service
is
not
a
testing
ground
for
the
arbitrator's
judgments
about
whether
or
not
mr.
hyde
will
eventually
become
fully
rehabilitated,
what
the
arbitrator
said
in--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
unless
the
arbitrator
makes
a
factual
finding
based
on
the
evidence
presented
at
the
arbitration
hearing
that
he
finds
that
there
is
not
a
risk
that
the
misconduct
will
occur
again
in
the
future.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
when
i
say
no
risk,
that
he
does
not
find
the
basis
of
the
facts
before
him
that
there
is
a
undue
risk
that
that
misconduct
will
occur
again
in
the
future.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
what
the
arbitrator
said
in
this
case
was
that
he
found
the
risk.
what
he
said
is,
well,
i
think
that
if
you
keep
him
off
employment
for
another
sixty
days
and
he
shows
some
initial
commitment
to
rehabilitating
himself
that
you
should
assume
the
risk
that
he
will
commit
misconduct
in
the
future.
you
are
asking
for
a
clear
rule.
let
me
give
you
an
analogy
where
there
is
a
clear
rule
that
exists.
in
the
airline
industry
under
the
statutes
regulating
the
safety
of
the
airline
industry,
airlines
are
required
to
maintain
the
highest
possible
degree
of
safety.
and
with
respect
to
the
alcoholics
that
justice
blackmun
mentioned
before,
the
federal
aviation
administration
has
said
if
there
is
a
pilot
who
we
know
is
an
alcoholic,
we
will
not
recertify
him
to
fly
a
plane
and
he
cannot
be
employed
to
fly
a
plane,
unless
there
is
an
established
clinical
evidence
of
his
recovery
and
he
has
abstained
from
drinking
for
two
years.
that
is
the
kind
of
evidence
and
finding
that
we
are
suggesting
that
the
arbitrator
should
be
required
to
make
a
finding
with
respect
to
about
a
letter
carrier
who
has
committed
a
criminal
act
in
failing
to
deliver
or
delaying
the
mail,
that
he
will
not
do
that
again.
that
is
the
degree
of
safety,
and
sanctity,
and
integrity
of
the
mails
that
we
believe
congress
imposed
the
obligation
upon
the
postal
service
to
ensure.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
correct.
those
findings
indicated,
the
first
one
that
you
read
about,
that
he
was
not
totally
persuaded
that
mr.
hyde
has
the
present
emotional
stability
to
perform
the
job,
is
why
he
did
not
put
mr.
hyde
back
in
initially.
he
postponed
it
for
sixty
days.
but
then
he
did
not
say
that
at
the
end
of
sixty
days
that
i
will
reconvene
and
see
what
mr.
hyde's
mental
status
is.
he
would
not
ask
for
additional
evidence
on
whether
or
not
mr.
hyde
was
rehabilitated.
he
said
that
at
the
end
of
sixty
days,
if
he
meets
the
following
three
conditions,
you
have
to
reinstate
him.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
do
not
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
the
question
before
the
arbitrator
is
what
are
the
facts
and
what
does
the
contract
provide.
he
found
the
facts,
and
he
also
found
what
the
contract
provided.
he
found
that
the
contractually
appropriate
remedy
was
reinstatement
to
a
letter
carrier
position
at
the
end
of
sixty
days.
this
court...
that
is
the
question,
whether
or
not
that
interpretation
of
the
contract,
as
justice
stevens
has
hypothesized,
that
we
assume
that
the
postal
service
agreed
to,
is
against
public
policy.
there
is
no
need
for
remand.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
justice
kennedy,
let
me
make
two
comments.
with
respect
to
your
first
point
about
what
other
kind
of
cases
would
come
in
within
the
rule
that
we
are
talking
about.
you
have
to
again
distinguish
between
acts
of
misfeasance
and
statutory
malfeasance.
here
we
see
that
congress
has
prohibited
for
criminal
sanction
and
definition
particular
acts
that
postal
service
employees
shall
not
engage
in.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
theft
from
the
mail
is
statutorily
prohibited.
and
unless
there
is
a
finding
that
the
individual
will
not
do
it
again,
we
believe
that
we
are
not
statutorily
+/.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
do
not
dispute
the
difficulty
of
making
clinical
judgments,
justice
kennedy.
on
the
other
hand,
the
postal
service
makes
them
in
their
initial
discharge
decisions.
the
arbitrator
makes
them
in
cases
where
the
arbitrator
is
entitled
to
do
it.
and
when
there
has
been
no
arbitrator
appointed
in
contractual
disputes
about
the
propriety
of
discharges,
courts
have
to
make
them.
somebody
has
got
to
make
them.
the
question
for
this
court
to
decide
in
our
argument
is
that
congress
has
said
that
for
this
small
class
of
cases
that
the
courts
have
the
final
say
on
whether
or
not
the
risk
is
undue.
the
arbitrator
has
the
final
say
on
whether
or
not
there
is
in
fact
that
risk.
but
someone
has
to
make
the
initial
call
as
to
whether
there
is
in
fact
that
risk.
and
then
someone
else,
maybe
the
arbitrator,
or
maybe
the
postal
service
and
then
the
courts,
and
we
say
that
it
is
the
postal
service
and
then
the
courts,
has
to
make
the
decision
about
whether
it
is
undue.
but
the
fact
that
it
is
difficult
to
make
those
findings
does
not
relieve
anyone
of
the
obligation
of
having
to
make
them,
because
the
postal
service
has
to
make
them
initially.
and
when
they
go
to
arbitration,
the
arbitrator
still
has
to
make
them.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
we
have
agreed
that
the
arbitrator
would
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
future
risk.
once
he
defines
what
he
believes
the
future
risk
to
be,
then
xx
say
that
is
up
to
the
postal
service
in
the
first
instance,
and
ultimately
to
the
courts,
as
this
court
said
in
misco
and
w.r.
grace,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
risk
is
undue.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
correct,
he
did.
we
are
not
disputing
that
he
misinterpreted
the
contract.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
he
found
that
there
was
a
risk,
and
he
also
found
that
there
were
offsetting
mitigating
factors.
he
found
the
fact
that
mr.
hyde's
father
had
died
the
year
before,
the
fact
that
his
brother
had
come
close
to
nearly
dying,
the
fact
that
he
had
cancer
the
year
before,
and
above
all
else
he
found
that
there
was
compulsive
gambler.
but
if
the
risk
that
he
found
is
one
that
the
postal
service
is
statutorily
not
permitted
to
incur
which
is
what
we
suggest
here,
then
we
suggest
that
it
is
up
to
a
court
to
vacate
that
arbitration
award,
even
though
the
arbitrator
correctly
interpreted
the
contract.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
if
he
had
just
been
a
negligent
or
lousy
postal
service
employee,
he
would
not
have
met
what
we
consider
to
be
the
threshold
standard
for
these
cases,
that
he
had
engaged
in
conduct
that
would
have
put
him
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
1703
and
that
there
would
not
be
a
risk
for
him.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
not
if
he
were
just
negligent
in
doing
so,
again--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
what
the
arbitrator
found.
the
arbitrator
said
that
there
was
a
causal
connection.
we
do
not
know
that
it
was,
but
he
found
it.
we
are
bound
by
the
arbitrator's
findings.
there
is
nothing
that
we
can
do
about
them.
that
is
in
fact
justice
white
the
important
point
here.
that
the
postal
service
is
bound
by
the
arbitrator's
findings.
given
those
findings,
it
is
told
that--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--we
think
that
we
are
bound
by
all
of
them.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
we
are
not
suggesting
that
if
the
letter
carriers
in
their
grievance
had
said
he
did
it,
but
he
has
got
a
problem,
would
you
put
him
in
another
job
where
he
does
not
have
access
to
the
mails,
that
if
the
arbitrator
found
that
that
was
contractually
appropriate,
that
that
would
put
us
in
violation
of
our
statutory
mandate.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
his
order
says
reinstatement.
and
reinstatement
in
the
ordinary
english
language
means
put
the
person
where
he
was
before.
and
it
certainly
means
that
in
the
accepted
understanding
in
the
labor
relations
context.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
this
is
not
a
theft
case.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
unlawful
delay.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
and
did
not
report
it
back
to
the
postal
service
that
he
has
failed
to
deliver
it
at
the
end
of
the
day.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it
was
a
guilty
plea
for
unlawful
delay.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
believe
it
does,
although
i
will
have
to--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
again,
if
you
put
the
term
gross
negligence
on
it,
justice
kennedy,
you
have
got
one
of
those
statutory
acts
of
misfeasance.
whatever
the
standard
is
under
1703,
our
position
is
that
we
are
statutorily
obliged
to
enforce
1703
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
violations
of
1703.
and
if
this
person
was
identified
by
the
arbitrator
as
a
person
who
has
violated
1703
and
that
there
was
a
risk
of
him
doing
it
again,
our
hands
are
tied.
we
read
our
statutory
obligations
as
precluding
us
from
reinstatement.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
every
agency--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--you
will
find
it
with
respect
to
every
employer
who
has
statutory
obligations,
some
of
whom
do
not
have
to
be
agencies
in
government.
for
example,
the
airlines
and
the
airline
industry
that
i
made
reference
to
before
have
statutory
obligations.
anytime
that
congress
passes
a
statute,
there
may
be
an
arbitration
award
out
there
that
could
be
brought
in
conflict
with
that
statute.
hopefully,
arbitrators
will
not
issue
too
many
of
those
kinds
of
awards.
and
you
will
not
be
put
in
the
position
that
we
are
in
here
today
very
often.
but
as
we
read
the
arbitrator's
award
and
as
we
read
the
statute,
that
conflict
exists
in
this
case.
with
the
chief
justice's
position,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
would
like
to
use
the
minute
to
address
three
quick
points.
one
is
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
of
junk
mail.
and
let
me
stress
that
the
reason
why
we
have
come
to
this
court
with
this
case
is
because
the
postal
service
feels
that
every
piece
of
mail
that
is
given
to
the
postal
service,
that
the
postal
service
is
obligated
to
deliver
and
safeguard
against
undue
risk
of
non-delivery.
whether
the
mail
in
junk
mail
or
whether
it
is
checks
for
afdc
benefits
to
unwed
mothers,
all
of
the
mail
is
important
from
the
postal
service's
perspective.
and
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
to
ensure
that
it
is
delivered.
justice
scalia,
i
fumbled
your
question
a
little
bit
about
how
much
risk,
and
let
me
try
to
readdress
that.
what
we
consider
to
be
an
undue
risk
is
an
employee
who
there
is
a
finding
made
is
a
significantly
greater
risk
than
the
average
employee.
that
the
average
employee
is
not
one
that
we
have
any
indicia
to
know
other
than
just
systematic
risk,
that
someone
may
commit
misconduct.
but
here
we
had
identified
for
us--
