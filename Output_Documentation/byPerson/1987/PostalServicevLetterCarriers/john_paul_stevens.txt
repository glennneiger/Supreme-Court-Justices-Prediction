justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
question,
mr.
nager.
what
is
the
normal,
how
much
mail
would
he
normally
carry?
this
is
not
a
year
and
a
half's
accumulation
of
mail
obviously,
3500
pieces.
would
that
be
a
couple
of
day's
mail?
justice
stevens
it
is
kind
of
hard
to
understand
how
mail
that
old
could
be.
he
must
have
delivered
some
of
it
since
that
period.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
before
you
get
to
that,
because
this
is
brought
to
my
mind
by
your
reference
to
the
kaiser
case.
do
you
dispute
the
fact
that
if
we
did
not
have
a
public
policy
problem
in
the
case,
that
the
arbitrator's
award
would
be
one
that
would
be
a
permissible
reading
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
stevens
so
the
case
that
we
have
to
decide
is
one
in
which
we
could
assume
arguendo
that
the
parties
had
spelled
out
that
if
this
particular
problem
should
arise
in
the
future,
that
this
solution
will
be
given,
that
this
will
be
the
solution.
then
we
say
would
that
contractual
provision
be
against
the
public
policy.
justice
stevens
may
i
clear
up
one
factual
thing.
we
have
talked
about
theft.
this
is
not
a
theft
case,
is
it;
he
did
not
open
any
mail,
did
he,
there
is
no
evidence
of
that?
justice
stevens
it
is
just
a
delay
case.
justice
stevens
he
just
left
unopened
and
undelivered
mail
in
his
case.
justice
stevens
and
the
criminal
proceeding
did
not
involve
any
theft,
it
was
just
delay?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
last
question.
the
award
says
that
at
the
end
of
the
sixty
day
period
that
if
it
is
shown
that
he
has
done
these
various
things.
to
whom
was
that
showing
to
be
made,
do
you
understand,
who
was
to
make
the
findings
after
sixty
days?
justice
stevens
to
go
back
before
the
arbitrator
if
you
had
to?
