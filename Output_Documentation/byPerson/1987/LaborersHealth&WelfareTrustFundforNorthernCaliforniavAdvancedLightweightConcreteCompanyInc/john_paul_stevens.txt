john
paul
stevens
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
85-2079,
laborers
health
and
welfare
fund
versus
advanced
lightweight
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
1980,
congress
amended
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
to
provide
trustees
of
multiemployer
benefit
plans
with
an
effective
federal
remedy
to
collect
the
delinquent
employer
contributions.
the
special
remedy
provides
that
they
not
only
can
recover
the
amount
of
the
delinquency
but
also
prejudgment
interest
plus
liquidated
damages
and
an
amount
at
least
equal
to
that
interest
and
attorney's
fees
and
costs.
there
is
no
question
but
the
remedy
is
available
when
an
employer
is
delinquent
in
meeting
his
contractual
obligations.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
remedy
also
applies
during
the
period
after
the
expiration
of
a
contract
when
the
employer
maybe
under
duty
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
continue
making
payments
as
part
of
his
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
the
ninth
circuit,
in
agreement
with
other
circuits
in
the
country,
held
that
the
statute
did
not
apply
in
that
situation,
and
we
affirm
that
decision
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk.
our
opinion
is
unanimous
and
justice
kennedy
did
not
participate.
