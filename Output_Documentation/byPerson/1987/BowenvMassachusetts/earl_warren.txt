exactly.
chief
justice
warren
well,
we
are
sort
of
confronted
with
how
to
interpret
that
tucker
act.
not
in
just
this
context,
but
elsewhere.
what
is
the
line
that
you
are
drawing
as
to
what
does
not
constitute
monetary
relief,
is
it
just
in
this
narrow
area
of
benefits
denied
by
the
government,
or
is
it
whenever
you
come
to
district
court
in
any
case
and
do
not
ask
for
money,
but
just
ask
for
a
declaratory
judgment
or
an
injunction?
i
mean
that
would
be
disastrous.
chief
justice
warren
it
is
not
prohibited
anywhere
else.
it
is
just
that
you
have
a
claim
for
money
damages.
and
you
would
chose
instead
to
apply
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
secretary
owes
you
money.
would
you
allow
that?
chief
justice
warren
but
they
are
surely
just
an
example.
i
mean
the
government's
proposal
has
the
advantage
of
being
a
clear
line.
i
am
not
sure
what
your
line
is,
except
that
grant-in-aid
things
are
covered.
but
you
cannot
draw
the
line
there.
is
what
you
are
saying
that
as
long
as
you
do
not
ask
for
money,
that
you
do
not
have
to
go
to
the
claims
court
or
what,
what
is
the
line
that
you
want
us
to
adopt?
chief
justice
warren
can
your
test
be
stated
in
one
sentence?
