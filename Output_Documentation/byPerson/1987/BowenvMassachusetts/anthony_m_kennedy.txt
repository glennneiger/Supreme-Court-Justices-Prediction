justice
kennedy
the
first
circuit
said
that
in
the
claims
court
that
its
judgment
would
be
collateral
estoppel.
do
you
accept
that
proposition,
can
the
government
be
collaterally
estopped?
justice
kennedy
so
if
the
first
circuit
is
correct,
then
there
is
estoppel
in
the
claims
court,
you
concede
that?
justice
kennedy
no.
i
am
saying
that
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
we
affirm
the
first
circuit
and
its
reasoning.
would
you
then
concede
that
you
are
collaterally
estopped
in
the
claims
court?
justice
kennedy
i
did
not
think
so.
justice
kennedy
insofar
as
1316
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
hurts
you
more
than
it
helps
you.
it
is
a
statement
by
the
congress
that
you
can
go
directly
to
the
circuit
courts
if
you
have
a
question
of
interpretation
at
the
outset.
you
begin
your
argument
with
1316,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
not
a
very
strong
point.
justice
kennedy
you
are
entitled
to
a
lump
sum
under
1316?
justice
kennedy
where
do
you
get
the
lump
sum?
justice
kennedy
that
is
a
regulation.
