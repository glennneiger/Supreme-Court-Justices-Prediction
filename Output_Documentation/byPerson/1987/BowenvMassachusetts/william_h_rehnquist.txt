mr.
englert,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
barnico.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now
what
provision
of
the
statute
is
that
that
you
are
relying
on?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
where
is
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
xii.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
in
a
system
when
you
go
to
regional
courts
of
appeals,
that
is
understandable.
i
think
that
justice
scalia's
hypothesis
was
if
you
go
to
the
federal
circuit,
that
presumably
all
of
these
kinds
of
cases
are
going
to
the
federal
circuit.
so
the
government
would
not
be
entitled
to
say,
well,
that
may
be
the
rule
in
massachusetts,
but
it
is
not
in
utah.
if
the
federal
circuit
says
that
it
handles
these
cases,
that
is
going
to
be
the
rule
for
the
whole
united
states.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
if
they
include
a
prayer
for
money
judgment
against
the
government?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
congress
could
have
just
as
easily,
and
i
think
that
the
government
argues
here,
have
allocated
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
that
we
want
all
claims
for
money
judgment
against
the
government
to
be
tried
in
the
claims
court
and
go
to
the
federal
circuit.
now
that
means
that
the
federal
circuit
will
be
expounding
on
lots
of
different
areas
of
the
law,
but
that
the
unifying
factor
would
be
the
money
judgment
against
the
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
barnico.
mr.
englert,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
