justice
scalia
what
is
the
district
court
who
gets
something
like
that
supposed
to
do,
i
recall
confronting
this
on
the
d.c.
circuit,
are
you
supposed
to
deem
that
to
include
a
claim
for
monetary
relief
or
not.
you
know,
the
usual
rule,
what
court
you
are
in
is
to
be
adjudged
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint,
right,
and
a
complaint
is
deemed
to
be
amended
to
show
that
you
get
all
of
the
relief
that
the
proof
entitles
you
to.
and
when
you
are
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment
in
a
matter
where
it
is
clear
that
the
effect
of
that
declaratory
judgment
will
entitle
you
to
money,
i
assume
that
without
any
amendment
of
the
complaint
at
all
that
the
court
that
enters
the
declaratory
judgment
ought
to
enter
an
order
for
the
money
relief
as
well,
should
it
not?
justice
scalia
so
really
what
you
say
is
that
the
state
can
bring
the
action
if
they
specifically
disclaim
any
desire
for
monetary
relief.
not
just
bring
it
purely
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
but
say
we
are
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
and
we
waive
all
right
for
monetary
relief.
justice
scalia
but
there
is
a
way
to
do
it?
justice
scalia
that
can
happen
under
the
tucker
act,
too,
do
not
forget
that.
below
$10,000,
even
if
it
is
under
the
tucker
act,
it
will
arise
in
the
district
courts.
justice
scalia
will
go
to
the
federal
circuit.
but
you
will
have
district
courts
other
than
the
claims
court.
but
pursuing
justice
o'connor's
point
a
little
bit.
this
case
involves
a
problem
really
peculiar
to
massachusetts,
because
they
have
a
difference
between
the
department
of
education
and
the
department
of
mental
health
and
how
they
handle
certain
things.
is
this
not
one
of
those
kinds
of
cases
where
there
is
perhaps
some
benefit
in
having
the
regional
circuits
which
perhaps
have
a
better
understanding
of
the
various
states
within
their
circuits
handling
governmental
matters
such
as
this,
having
them.
i
understand
that
you
want
to
have
the
statute
interpreted
according
to
the
intent
of
congress.
but
from
a
practical
standpoint,
does
it
not
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
have
this
kind
of
case
in
the
regional
circuit
rather
than
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
scalia
where
is
the
legislative
history
referring
to
grant-in-aid
cases
that
you
were
discussing
with
justice
o'connor
earlier,
that
came
up
in
what
context?
justice
scalia
but
that
assuredly
was
not
invoked
in
money
claims
under
grant-in-aid
programs.
i
mean
it
is
impossible
to
interpret
it
to
be
referring
to
any
invocation
when
there
had
been
a
money
claim.
money
claims
in
grant-in-aid
programs
would
have
come
under
the
tucker
act,
even
before
this
amendment
to
the
apa,
right?
justice
scalia
so
i
do
not
see
how
it
gives
you
any
problem
at
all.
you
see
to
acknowledge
that
it
gives
you
some
problem.
justice
scalia
and
this
reference
must
mean
pre-issuance
challenge
to
regulations,
which
is
how
a
lot
of
grant-in-aid
claims
come
up,
of
course.
but
then
when
the
regulations
are
proposed
and
finally
adopted,
someone
takes
them
up
to
challenge
them
or
tries
to.
justice
scalia
yes,
i
recall
that
the
briefs
seem
to
disagree
on
that
point.
did
the
claim
for
the
money
relief
here
precisely
track
the
claim
for
injunctive
and
prospective
relief?
it
would
seem
to
me
that
sometimes
in
the
grant-in-aid
programs
that
the
state
would
be
objecting
to
an
overall
interpretation
of
a
regulation
and
see
prospective
relief.
and
then
there
would
some
discrete
instances
where
they
would
want
money
back.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
two
might
not
track
each
other.
justice
scalia
but
that
is
often
true
of
the
cases
that
go
to
the
claims
court
and
to
the
federal
circuit
under
the
tucker
act.
the
jurisdiction
is
not
based
on
subject
matter.
it
is
based
on
whether
there
is
a
monetary
claim.
they
have
a
wide
diversity
of
subject
matters.
they
get
into
every
kind
of
issue
that
you
can
imagine.
so
i
do
not
see
what
this
proves.
it
just
proves
that
this
litigation
like
all
other
litigation
can
arise
in
either
of
those
courts.
justice
scalia
of
course,
41
u.s.
c
1316
sends
you
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
you
did
not
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
you
went
to
the
district
court.
you
are
going
to
the
district
court
anyway.
i
mean
that
is
just
a
statutory
provision
dealing
with
quite
different
situations.
justice
scalia
do
you
think
that
the
government
would
not
have
been
bound
with
respect
to
its
future
action
on
the
same
matter
had
you
gotten
your
judgment
from
the
federal
circuit
under
the
tucker
act
instead
from
the
court
of
appeals
here?
justice
scalia
the
same
issue
involving
the
same
party
with
the
case?
justice
scalia
it
is
not
the
secretary,
it
is
the
statute.
the
statute
says
that
you
can
get
into
the
district
court
only
if
there
is
no
other
adequate
remedy.
justice
scalia
it
is
not
his
judgment
about
what
is
adequate,
but
rather
it
is
the
congress'
and
ultimately
the
courts,
i
suppose.
justice
scalia
these
are
jurisdictional
questions.
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
to
waste
time
litigating
is
whether
you
should
have
been
in
the
claims
court
or
in
the
district
court.
and
it
does
not
just
arise
at
the
district
level,
but
then
you
have
to
decide
which
of
the
two
courts
of
appeal
that
you
should
have
gone
to.
it
is
very
complicated.
justice
scalia
what
kind
of
prayer
suggests
that,
by
the
way.
you
know,
there
is
the
boilerplate
at
the
end
of
every
complaint
which
says
as
such
other
relief
as
may
be
appropriate.
what
is
money
damages
are
appropriate,
is
that
a
prayer
for
money
damages?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
that
everybody
would
think
that,
to
adopt
a
rule
like
that
or
something,
can
we
train
pleaders
to
put
in
or
not
put
in
that
provision?
justice
scalia
does
massachusetts
has
an
office
here
in
washington?
justice
scalia
i
think
that
most
states
do.
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
be
so
horrible.
justice
scalia
if
it
is
under
$10,000,
they
can
bring
the
suit
in
district
court.
