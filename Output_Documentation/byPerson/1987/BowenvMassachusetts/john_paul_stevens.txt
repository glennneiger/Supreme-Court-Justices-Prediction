justice
stevens
mr.
englert,
would
you
speak
up
just
a
little
bit.
i
am
having
trouble
hearing.
justice
stevens
well,
it
is
not
all
that
clear.
it
applies
to
all
actions
seeking
relief
other
than
money
damages.
and
i
am
not
sure
if
one
reads
that
language
literally
and
you
have
an
action
which
seeks
a
declaratory
judgment
which
is
relief
other
than
money
damages
and
also
seeks
money
damages,
that
a
literal
reading
of
the
language
would
not
necessarily
foreclose
jurisdiction.
justice
stevens
that
is
right.
justice
stevens
now
you
rely
primarily
on
704
rather
than
702.
justice
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
as
a
matter
of
history
that
in
some
of
these
cases
that
the
government
did
not
take
the
position
that
you
are
taking
now,
that
they
allowed
some
of
these
cases
to
go
forward
in
the
district
courts
outside
of
the
court
of
claims?
justice
stevens
it
was
not
as
obvious
as
it
is
now.
did
the
government
raise
this
argument
at
the
district
court
level
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
maybe
it
is
a
little
out
of
line.
but
supposing
we
granted
cert
to
review
the
merits
of
the
issue
as
well
as
the
jurisdictional
questions.
and
we
had
decided
that
(a)
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
legal
issue
and
that
they
were
right
on
that
issue,
and
then
we
said
nothing
about
the
money.
would
not
the
government
pay
the
money
to
the
state,
or
would
they
take
this
position
that
there
is
a
legal
defense,
and
we
will
not
pay
even
though
the
state
was
entitled
to
it?
justice
stevens
it
is
not
just
collateral
estoppel.
it
is
really
how
one
thinks
that
the
government
should
operate
when
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
held
that
they
violated
the
law.
often,
we
used
to
have
cases
where
we
would
not
enjoin
the
state.
we
entered
declaratory
judgments
on
the
assumption
that
the
state
would
accept
the
rule
of
law.
but
the
government,
you
are
telling
me,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
that
the
executive
department
says,
well,
they
do
not
have
a
legal
right
to
get
it,
even
though
we
have
no
legal
right
to
retain
it,
so
we
are
going
to
make
them
litigate
for
it?
justice
stevens
my
hypothesis
was
this
very
case,
and
we
only
decided
the
issue
that
they
decided.
and
your
position
is
that
the
government
would
still
keep
the
money,
if
i
understand
you.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
the
regulatory
decision
made
by
the
secretary
was
erroneous
and
violated
the
statute.
and
if
we
had
affirmed
that
on
the
merits
and
did
not
say
anything
about
money,
you
are
suggesting
to
me
that
the
secretary
would
not
pay
the
state
the
money.
justice
stevens
you
would.
you
would
not
then
make
the
collateral
estoppel.
you
would
not
say,
well,
they
would
split
their
cause
of
action,
even
though
they
go
to
court
of
claims.
i
thought
that
you
were
saying
that
we
would
make
the
defense
that
this
cause
of
action
is
split,
and
they
cannot
get
relief.
justice
stevens
but
my
point
is
that
if
you
are
wrong
on
the
merits
regardless
of
the
technicalities
of
whether
there
is
collateral
estoppel
or
not.
i
mean
we
are
talking
about
government
decisions.
we
are
not
talking
about
private
litigation
between
private
parties.
the
executive
department
says
that
they
still
want
to
keep
the
money,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
that
is
why
i
asked
you
if
we
had
decided,
whether
you
would
still
do
that.
so
there
would
be
nothing
more
to
relitigate
on
the
merits.
justice
stevens
you
would?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
first
case
i
have
announced
is
bowen
against
massachusetts,
nos.
87-712
and
87-929.
the
principal
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
a
final
order
of
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
refusing
to
reimburse
a
state
for
a
category
of
expenditures
under
its
medicaid
program.
the
answer
to
the
question
depends
on
the
meaning
of
section
702
and
704
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
with
respect
to
section
702,
the
issue
is
whether
an
action
seeking
a
review
of
a
decision
by
the
secretary
is
allowing
reimbursement
of
these
expenses
is
an
action
seeking
relief
other
than
money
damages
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
largely
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
written
by
judge
bork,
we
disagreed
with
the
secretary
and
conclude
that
this
is
not
an
action
for
money
damages.
with
respect
to
section
704,
the
question
is
whether
relief
is
barred
because
the
state
has
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
claims
court.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
our
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
claims
court
remedy
is
not
adequate.
accordingly,
we
reject
the
secretary's
arguments
and
conclude
that
the
district
court
did
have
jurisdiction
to
grant
complete
relief
in
this
case.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result
and
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined.
