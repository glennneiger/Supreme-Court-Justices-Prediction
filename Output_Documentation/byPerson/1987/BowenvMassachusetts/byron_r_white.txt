justice
white
would
you
have
trouble
with
just
a
declaratory
judgment
that
says
here
is
the
situation,
we
are
in
disagreement
with
the
government
on
this
issue,
we
do
not
ask
for
an
injunction
now,
or
any
money,
or
anything
else,
we
just
want
a
judgment,
and
we
think
that
the
secretary
will
live
up
to
the
judgment?
justice
white
well,
they
do
not
ask
for
it.
but
if
there
is
a
judgment,
they
are
probably
then
going
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
and
the
legal
issue
will
have
been
settled.
justice
white
i
am
just
asking
you,
would
you
object
just
to
declaratory
judgment?
justice
white
so
you
think
that
the
government,
if
there
was
a
declaratory
judgment
which
you
did
not
object
to,
you
think
that
the
government
would
then
still
refuse
to
refund
the
money,
if
it
had
been
adjudged
finally
in
a
court
that
the
secretary
had
been
wrong
all
the
way?
justice
white
well,
the
state
did
not
ask
for
money.
it
even
disclaims.
it
did
not
want
any
money.
justice
white
even
though
you
had
been
unlawful
all
the
way?
justice
white
well,
res
adjudicata
certainly
would
not
apply
if
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
the
money
judgment.
justice
white
well,
it
set
aside
the
money
judgment,
did
it
not?
justice
white
on
the
grounds
that?
justice
white
no
one
in
your
client's
position
is
going
to
ask
in
the
district
court
for
money
damages.
and
there
will
just
be
requests
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
prospective
relief,
and
no
request
for
money
damages.
and
there
is
no
other
forum.
there
is
not
a
forum
in
the
court
of
claims
just
to
go
get
declaratory
judgments.
justice
white
well,
why
should
not
the
district
court
just
say
do
you
want
to
stay
in
this
court
or
not;
and
if
you
do,
you
better
withdraw
your
claim
for
money
damages?
justice
white
that
just
really
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
justice
white
it
does
not
have
to
have
a
binding
waiver.
the
district
court
just
says
i
am
going
to
entertain
this
claim
for
money
damages,
i
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
do
that.
justice
white
of
course,
your
position
means
that
the
government
can
go
around
every
circuit
relitigating
the
same
issue.
justice
white
well,
i
know
that.
in
a
way,
it
is
strange
that
the
government
wants
to
be
able
to
litigate
it
only
once.
