mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
importance
of
circuit
court
review
that
was
discussed
earlier
in
the
argument
is
not
as
mr.
englert
suggests
just
a
question
of
a
policy
preference.
in
fact,
as
one
of
the
justices
has
pointed
out
and
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
has
addressed,
there
is
a
certain
familiarity
that
circuit
courts
develop
with
a
given
state's
medicaid
plan
and
disputes
that
might
arise
either
between
states
or
between
the
secretary
and
the
state
in
this
case.
but
the
more
important
point
that
i
wish
to
address
on
that
score
is
that
congress
has
provided
evidence
that
it
believes
that
the
circuit
court's
role
is
important
in
these
cases.
and
that
is,
and
it
cannot
be
disputed
here,
is
that
when
congress
addressed
the
question
of
judicial
review
of
disputes
between
the
secretary
and
the
states
under
the
medicaid
program,
that
it
expressly
authorized
states
to
bring
petitions
to
the
circuits
courts
to
review
instances
in
which
the
secretary
has
found
that
states,
or
their
plans,
or
their
amendments
to
their
state
plans
are
not
in
compliance
with
the
medicaid
act.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
42
u.s.c.
1316(a)(3).
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
that
appears
in
the
appendix
of
the
brief,
the
statutory
appendix
to
the
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
point
that
we
wish
to
make
is
that
for
jurisdictional
purposes,
that
as
we
try
to
determine
congressional
intent
over
these
actions.
there
is
no
significant
difference
between
the
action
of
the
secretary
involved
here
and
the
kind
of
action
that
arises
when
the
secretary
finds
that
the
state
or
an
amendment
to
a
plan
does
not
comply
with
the
medicaid
act.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
but,
your
honor,
it
proves
more
than
that.
because
here,
as
the
secretary
points
out,
there
is
a
lack
of
a
specific
statute
providing
for
review
of
disallowances.
we
turn
to
the
statutory
context
to
determine
under
what
statute
that
a
state
can
bring
an
action,
and
under
what
statute
that
congress
has
waived
sovereign
immunity.
and
that
judgment
is
formed
partially
by
the
statute
that
governs
the
waiver
in
this
section
702,
but
it
is
also
governed
by
the
overall
statutory
context.
because
if
the
secretary
is
correct,
it
means
that
congress
somehow
chose
to
divert
cases
such
as
ours,
the
disallowance
cases,
from
the
local
courts,
the
district
courts
and
the
circuit
courts,
and
send
them
to
a
more
specialized
centralized
forum
like
the
claims
court
and
like
the
federal
circuit.
and
we
think
that
is
a
reading
of
the
statutory
context
that
cannot
be
supported.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
that
is
right.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
there
is
a
reason
why
we
went
to
the
district
court.
because
you
had
to.
because
this
is
a
special
statute.
the
apa
reads
that
where
there
is
a
special
statute,
that
you
go
to
the
court
that
the
special
statute
proscribes.
and
in
the
absence
of
a
special
statute,
you
go
to
district
court.
it
was
not
a
strategic
determination
on
your
part.
you
had
to
go
there,
did
you
not?
not
entirely,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
we
went
to
the
district
court.
because
as
i
said,
it
was
the
result
of
earlier
litigation
with
the
secretary
over
the
question
of
whether
a
given
dispute
between
the
states
and
the
secretary
was
a
compliance
matter
or
a
disallowance
matter.
in
those
cases
that
were
litigated
all
over
the
country,
circuit
courts
roughly
determined
that
certain
questions
that
arose
under
the
program
were
indeed
compliance
matters.
but
in
those
cases,
the
secretary
represented
to
the
various
circuit
courts
of
appeal
around
the
country
that
he
would
not
contest
district
court
jurisdiction
over
the
same
cases.
so
it
was
not
surprising
that
in
this
case
that
not
only
did
we
identify
702
as
the
source
of
the
waiver,
but
that
we
proceeded
in
the
district
courts.
it
was
upon
the
secretary's
representation
to
the
first
circuit
that
he
would
not
contest
district
court
jurisdiction
over
the
same
case.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
your
honor,
it
is.
because
it
is
not
simply
a
question
at
the
outset.
compliance
matters
could
be
as
close
to
this
case
as
the
following
example.
that
is
if
we
had
not
provided
these
services
to
the
mentally
retarded
in
the
past
and
we
proposed
to
amend
our
medicaid
plan
to
include
these
services
and
made
it
the
basis
for
a
specific
amendment,
and
the
secretary
denied
the
amendment
on
the
same
ground
that
he
invoked
here,
that
is
that
when
we
train
people
to
eat
that
that
is
education
in
nature
and
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
act.
now
in
that
event,
we
would
have
had
an
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
on
the
same
record
testing
the
question
of
whether
the
secretary
had
erroneously
read
the
medicaid
act
to
exclude
those
services.
and
furthermore,
your
honor,
those
cases
could
also
implicate
money
as
well.
because
under
the
secretary's
regulations,
if
you
are
successful
through
the
administrative
process
and
we
presume
through
the
judicial
process
in
successfully
overturning
the
denial
of
an
amendment,
you
are
entitled
to
a
lump
sum
covering
the
services
back
to
the
time
that
the
amendment
was
submitted.
so
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
it
does
not
merely
address
situations
where
the
state
wishes
to
identify
a
legal
issue
at
the
threshold
and
litigate
that
question
before
any
injury
occurs.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
the
lump
sum,
your
honor,
is
mentioned
in
45
cfr
201.3.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
it
is
a
regulation.
but
you
know,
this
also
implicates
the
previous
response
of
my
brother
to
the
question
of
a
district
court
action
which
merely
tests
the
validity
of
a
regulation.
by
way
of
background,
one
of
the
reasons
why
these
disallowance
cases
are
growing
is
that
the
secretary
chooses
to
implement
policy
judgments
through
the
disallowance
mechanism
rather
than
to
specifically
state
through
regulations
what
services
are
covered
and
which
are
not.
and
so
when
the
court
considered
the
case
a
few
terms
ago
of
connecticut,
a
similar
connecticut
state
agency
against
the
secretary,
connecticut
cited
the
same
sort
of
broad
disallowance
that
carried
a
prospective
effect
and
implications
for
further
services
given
by
that
state.
so
it
may
be
well
for
mr.
englert
to
say
that
in
the
abstract
that
certain
cases
can
still
proceed
when
states
challenge
regulations
under
a
particular
grant-in-aid
program,
but
it
is
very
much
part
of
this
record
that
the
disallowance
procedure
is
used
for
far
different
purposes
than
a
technical
audit
or
the
adjustment
of
an
accounting
error.
it
is
used,
as
both
of
the
lower
courts
found,
to
make
prospective
coercive
judgments
about
the
scope
of
the
medicaid
act.
the
states
are
forced
at
that
point
to
decide
that
once
they
receive
that
first
disallowance
and
while
they
are
still
in
the
administrative
process
before
the
grant
appeals
board,
the
states
are
forced
to
make
a
judgment
about
whether
they
should
continue
to
provide
those
services
knowing
that
they
have
an
exposure,
that
the
millions
of
dollars
that
they
spent
could
well
be
disallowed
at
some
indeterminate
time
in
the
future.
and
faced
with
that
kind
of
situation
and
that
kind
of
relationship,
it
is
important
that
we
be
able
to
go
to
the
district
courts
to
secure
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
that
would
bind
the
parties
in
our
future
relationship.
the
court
of
appeals,
if
i
might
just
read
one
excerpt
from
the
decision,
said
that
the
commonwealth's
requested
injunction
is
not
specific
to
the
retrospective
1978-1982
reimbursement
disallowed
by
the
secretary.
rather,
it
stretches
into
the
future
as
does
the
legal
relationship
between
the
parties.
and
that
is
the
relief
that
we
sought,
and
that
is
the
relief
that
our
complaint
sets
out.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
i
would
not
expect
to
act
as
if
they
were
bound
in
the
same
way.
i
think
that
your
honor
is
suggesting
that--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--your
honor,
i
think
the
point
is
whether
the
effect
of
stare
decisis
alone
in
such
a
context
would
be
enough.
and
i
do
not
think
that
their
past
conduct
gives
us
that
kind
of
assurance.
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
think
that
it
is
different
as
well.
as
a
matter
of
record
before
this
court,
the
secretary
has
in
disallowances
that
have
followed
the
massachusetts
disallowance,
and
have
followed
the
opinion
of
the
first
circuit
in
this
case,
simply
disagreed
with
the
first
circuit
and
disallowed
reimbursement
to
i
believe
it
is
utah
and
tennessee.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
i
would
still
distinguish
that
from
that
binding
order.
and
it
may
well
be
the
difference
between
relief
that
we
consider
essential
and
what
the
secretary
deems
as
adequate.
the
point
about
the
federal
circuit--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
that
is
right.
at
the
threshold,
there
is
a
disagreement
between
some
of
the
circuits
and
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
section
704.
but
i
understand
that
there
is
a
statutory
basis
for
that
point.
the
points
addressed
in
the
briefs
though
thoroughly,
i
believe,
is
that
in
many
respects
that
the
claims
court
will
not
be
able
to
provide
the
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
that
the
beneficiaries
and
states
believe
would
be
necessary
to
govern
the
relationship
in
such
programs.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
the
district
court
entered
a
judgment
that
said
that
the
decision
of
the
secretary
was
reversed.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
no.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
in
this
case,
we
do
not
necessarily
say
that
the
relief
would
be
inadequate.
to
the
extent
that
in
such
cases
that
our
first
position
will
always
be
that
we
will
expect
the
secretary
to
abide
by
a
judgment
of
reversal,
and
whatever
declaration
of
law
accompanies
the
reversal.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
because
the
court
of
appeals
entered
relief
is
much
more
in
the
nature
of
an
injunction
than
the
district
court.
but
my
second
point
would
be
that
in
this
case
that
we
were
content
with
the
judgment
of
reversal,
but
we
asked
for
more.
and
there
was
no
indication
from
any
court
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
more.
but
as
we
tried
to
respectfully
tried
to
suggest
in
the
brief,
upon
such
a
reversal,
we
judged
that
to
be
adequate
in
the
absence
of
some
action
by
the
secretary
that
he
will
not
abide.
now
as
one
of
our
briefs
at
the
petition
stage
suggested,
it
is
going
to
be
the
district
court
that
we
will
want
to
go
to
for
a
coercive
order
in
the
event
that
the
secretary
does
not
abide
by
the
reversal
and
by
the
declaration
of
law
that
accompanies
the
reversal.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
no.
the
claims
court
would
throw
out,
i
imagine,
a
case
that
sought
only
declaratory
relief.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
now
the
discussion...
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
in
the
latter
case,
you
could
not
go
to
the
district
court
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
that
is
prohibited
by
some
other
statute.
that
is
one
of
the
other
limitations
that
the
secretary
identifies.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
it
would
depend
on
the
context,
your
honor.
in
the
grant-in-aid
context,
i
think
that
you
are
referring
to
really
a
rule
that
the
first
circuit
set
out,
in
the
sense
that
they
would
measure
the
amount
of
prospective
relief.
now
we
do
not
happen
to
agree
with
that
approach.
but
in
the
grant-in-aid
context,
at
least
the
district
court
would
be
able
to
rely
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
apa
that
identified
the
grant-in-aid
programs
as
one
example
of
the
kind
of
case
that
they
wished
to
have
brought
in
the
district
courts.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
the
line
relies
on
a
couple
of
factors.
i
cannot
draw
it
as
clearly
as
what
i
consider
to
be
the
simplistic
line
of
any
case
that
happens
to
involve
money
belongs
in
the
claims
court.
but
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
identifiable
factors.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
your
honor,
i
could
not
agree
more
about
the
waste
of
time.
and
it
is
only
complicated
by
changes
of
position
by
the
government,
i
might
add.
but
in
any
event,
i
suggest
that
the
court
has
already
identified
at
least
one
of
the
factors
in
its
own
consideration
of
the
tucker
act.
i
am
thinking
of
the
case
of
the
u.s.
v.
mottaz,
where
the
court
made
a
fairly
strong
statement
that
the
complaint
is
an
important
aspect
of
a
judgment
of
a
court
about
jurisdiction.
so
at
least
the
court
would
consider
what
kind
of
cases
made
by
the
plaintiff
and
what
relief
is
requested.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
no,
we
are
not,
but
we
are
urging
something
similar.
the
brief
refers
to
what
we
call
non-monetary
relief.
and
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
district
court
is
available
for
such
relief.
i
do
not
think
that
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
had
anything
different
in
mind
when
it
said
that
when
a
court
makes
a
judgment
that
an
administrator
has
violated
the
law
that
it
is
making
a
specific
remedy
when
it
orders
or
its
judgment
requires
that
administrator
to
turn
over
the
money.
i
think
that
the
kind
of
relief
and
the
line
that
we
suggest
is
in
the
same
nature
and
produces
the
same
result.
but
i
think
that
the
decision
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
had
more
to
do
with
prying
a
certain
kind
of
monetary
relief
away
from
the
term
money
damages.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
cases
brought
for
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
against
adjudicatory
decisions
under
grant-in-aid
programs
are
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
under
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
contained
in
section
702.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
then
the
rule
takes
more
than
one
sentence,
i
am
afraid.
and
it
is
that
when
the
court
considers
that
complaint
in
its
entirety
against
the
overall
statutory
context
of
the
subject
matter,
that
it
makes
a
determination
that
the
district
court
is
the
court
that
will
hear
such
a
case.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
that
is
similar.
that
would
depend,
your
honor,
on
whether
it
is
merely--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--and
it
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
state
is
going
to
be
required
to
make
a
binding
waiver
of
any
monetary
recovery.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
and
it
may
require
that
litigant
to
simply
drop
whatever
prayer
that
suggests
the
money
judgment.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
be
a
prayer
enough
to
defeat
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
no.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
no.
and
pleaders
are
often
faced
with
different
kinds
of
pressures.
and
in
this
case,
the
complaint
was
written
before
we
knew
that
the
tucker
act
even
applied
to
or
could
be
argued
that
it
could
be
applied
to
such
a
case.
now
the
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
today
has
to
do
with
the
relationship
between
the
federal
circuits
on
the
one
hand
and
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
on
the
other.
congress
intended
that
the
federal
circuit
and
the
claims
court
have
a
specialized
subject
matter.
the
federal
courts
improvement
act
that
was
enacted
by
congress
in
1982
demonstrates
that
congress
has
always
sought
to
preserve
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
as
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
in
terms
of
subject
matter.
the
legislative
history
of
that
act,
we
think,
is
very
important
to
the
case,
and
provides
a
further
statutory
context
to
decide
our
case.
there
was
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
federal
courts
improvement
act
that
suggests
that
congress
ever
believed
that
the
federal
circuit
would
become
a
national
forum
for
resolution
of
questions
under
the
social
security
act.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
that
is
his
competing
argument
on
intent.
and
it
is
there
that
there
is
authority
for
the
proposition
that
congress
intended
to
centralize
some
cases
or
cases
involving
money
according
to
the
solicitor,
and
that
we
happen
to
fall
in
those
cases.
my
point
is
that
that
rubs
right
up
against
congress'
express
intent
to
keep
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
available
for
the
kind
of
general
questions
of
important
social
policy
like
the
social
security
act.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
and
apparently,
they
are
doing
it
in
this
very
case.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
well,
they
must
have
their
reasons.
but
i
think
that
their
result
is
inconsistent
with
judgments
that
congress
has
made
about
the
subject
matters
of
the
cases
that
will
arise
and
be
heard
by
the
courts
that
were
created
in
1982.
finally,
i
should
make
the
point
that
the
court
has
previously
identified
at
least
one
consequence
of
litigating
in
the
claims
court.
and
that
is
that
when
you
litigate
in
the
claims
court,
that
ordinarily
you
litigate
in
washington.
and
for
the
court
to
adopt
the
view
of
the
solicitor
in
this
case
is
to
impute
to
congress
the
intent
that
beneficiaries
or
states
who
have
disputes
with
the
secretary
that
involve
money
under
the
medicaid
act
will
be
litigating
their
cases
in
washington.
and
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
an
intent
that
is
supported
by
any
of
the
legislative
history.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
i
believe
that
the
governor
has
a
small
office.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
i
think
that
the
point
is
much
more
important
as
to
the
beneficiaries,
your
honor.
and
it
is
made
by
an
amicus
brief
in
that
respect.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
the
little
tucker
act
applies.
but
many
of
the
class
actions
that
are
brought
by
legal
service
organizations
on
behalf
of
those
beneficiaries,
some
of
which
happen
to
involve
the
states
as
defendants,
would
ordinarily
involve
more
money
than
that.
in
conclusion,
congress
waived
sovereign
immunity
for
these
cases,
and
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
congress
did
not
intend
to
centralize
cases
such,
and
courts
created
in
1982
have
no
expertise
in
this
particular
area.
congress
intended
that
we
could
bring
these
cases
in
our
local
district
courts,
and
this
court
should
so
hold.
thank
you
very
much.
