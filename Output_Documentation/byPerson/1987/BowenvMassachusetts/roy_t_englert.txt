mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
jurisdictional
questions.
the
grant
appeals
board
of
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
disallowed
$11.3
million
in
federal
financial
participation
under
the
medicaid
program
to
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
the
commonwealth
challenged
that
disallowance
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
claiming
that
that
court
has
jurisdiction.
our
position
is
that
the
united
states
claims
court
has
jurisdiction.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
each
side
in
part.
we
petitioned
this
court
to
review
the
court's
partial
assertion
of
jurisdiction,
and
the
commonwealth
cross-petitioned
to
review
the
court's
partial
refusal
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
the
petition
and
cross-petition
were
both
granted.
by
way
of
background,
this
case
arises
from
two
audits
covering
the
years
1978
to
1982
of
massachusetts
expenditures
at
intermediate
care
facilities
for
the
mentally
retarded.
applying
a
longstanding
hhs
regulation,
the
auditors
determined
that
massachusetts
had
improperly
claimed
medicaid
reimbursement
for
certain
educational
services
that
the
state
department
of
education
was
required
to
pay
for.
$11.3
million
in
federal
financial
participation
was
disallowed,
and
that
is
a
small
fraction
of
the
total
federal
financial
participation
for
massachusetts
at
these
facilities
in
the
years
in
question.
as
was
its
right,
massachusetts
challenged
that
disallowance
in
the
grant
appeals
board,
an
entity
created
by
regulation
in
1973
to
review
disallowances
on
behalf
of
the
secretary.
the
grant
appeals
board
upheld
the
disallowances.
the
money
has
since
been
recouped
by
reducing
certain
medicaid
grants
to
massachusetts
in
subsequent
years.
in
response
to
the
gab
decisions,
massachusetts
filed
complaints
for
judicial
review
in
the
district
court.
the
commonwealth
recognized
that
there
is
no
statute
providing
specifically
for
judicial
review
of
disallowance
decisions.
the
complaints
did
assert
that
5
u.s.
c
702,
part
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
waives
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states,
and
permits
this
kind
of
action
to
proceed
in
district
court.
the
district
court
said
that
it
had
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
disagreed
with
the
grant
appeals
board
decisions
in
their
entirety,
and
said
that
the
commonwealth
was
entitled
to
federal
financial
participation
for
all
of
these
services,
and
entered
a
judgment
reversing
the
grant
appeals
board.
we
appealed,
and
argued
among
other
things
that
the
district
court
had
entered
a
money
judgment
against
the
united
states
without
any
applicable
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
permitted
such
a
judgment.
the
problem
with
using
5
u.s.c.
702
as
the
applicable
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
is
that
that
statute
applies
only
to
actions
"seeking
relief
other
than
money
damages.
"
we
contend
that
the
$11.3
million
at
issue
here
is
money
damages.
now
it
is
important
to
understand
that
we
were
not
arguing
that
the
grant
appeals
board
decisions
were
unreviewable.
rather
our
position
was
that
the
tucker
act
which
does
waive
sovereign
immunity
for
money
judgments
permitted
an
action
in
the
united
states
claims
court.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
is
a
split
in
the
circuits,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
court
actually
stands
along
among
the
courts
of
appeal.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
crux
of
the
issue
presented
by
the
commonwealth's
cross-petition,
and
we
think
that
it
is
really
the
crux
of
the
issue
presented
by
our
petition,
too.
that
question
is
addressed
rather
squarely
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1976
amendments
to
the
apa.
when
congress
used
the
phrase
money
damages,
it
meant
monetary
relief
as
opposed
to
declaratory
injunctive
mandamus
relief.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
there
actually
is
no
language
in
the
tucker
act
that
refers
to
money
damages.
the
tucker
act
is
a
very
old
statute.
and
the
limitations
on
the
powers
of
the
claims
court
under
the
tucker
act
have
been
inferred
from
the
surrounding
context,
and
not
directly
from
the
language
of
that
statute.
it
is
a
very
broadly
written
statute.
in
any
event,
i
think
that
congress
took
a
proposal
that
was
given
to
it
by
the
administrative
conference,
a
proposal
that
is
backed
up
by
numerous
memoranda
that
often
refer
to
all
forms
of
monetary
relief
being
excluded
from
the
proposal.
the
administrative
conference
happened
to
use
the
words
money
damages,
words
that
are
not
unnatural
to
use
to
describe
all
forms
of
monetary
relief,
and
those
are
the
words
that
congress
enacted.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
very
little,
your
honor.
he
relied
almost
entirely
on
a
single
reference
to
grant-in-aid
programs
in
the
house
report
and
the
senate
report.
that
reference
is
a
part
of
a
long
list
of
actions
in
which
sovereign
immunity
had
been
asserted
in
the
past
and
might
not
be
asserted
in
the
future
under
the
apa
amendments.
not
every
grant-in-aid
lawsuit
has
to
be
an
action
seeking
the
payment
of
money
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
some
states
have
succeeded
in
preventing
recoupment,
albeit
under
an
assertion
of
jurisdiction
that
we
think
is
invalid.
we
think
that
they
have
no
proper
means
to
prevent
recoupment.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
suppose
the
secretary
promulgated
a
new
regulation.
and
before
that
ever
took
effect,
if
it
were
to
take
effect
january
1,
1989,
and
on
april
20,
1988,
the
state
brought
a
prospective
challenge
to
that
regulation.
say
the
secretary
did
something
outrageous
like
promulgating
a
regulation
saying
that
there
will
be
no
further
reimbursement
for
intermediate
care
facilities
for
the
mentally
retarded
period.
there
is
no
accrued
monetary
claim
in
that
case,
and
there
is
not
going
to
be
an
accrued
monetary
claim
during
the
initial
pendency
of
the
lawsuit.
and
we
have
no
problems
letting
the
district
courts
address
that
and
grant
a
declaratory
relief.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if
they
do
not
want
money.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
but
the
ordinary
rules
of
res
adjudicata,
as
we
understand
them,
preclude
that
kind
of
claims
splitting,
first
getting
your
judgment
in
one
court,
and
then
bringing
a
separate
claim
in
another
court.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
standing
alone,
we
would
not.
although
we
would
object
if
they
were
then
successful
in
transforming
that
into
a
money
judgment
for
past
due
money
in
the
claims
court,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we
do
think
that
that
is
the
better
view.
and
alternative
view
would
be
to
say
that
the
state
may
bring
the
claim,
but
is
foreclosed
from
later
seeking
money.
but
we
think
that
the
view
that
you
just
stated
is
the
better
approach.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
is
a
way
to
do
it,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if
we
thought
that
the
state
had
brought
the
action
in
district
court
to
secure
district
court
jurisdiction
over
an
action
that
should
have
been
in
the
claims
court
if
the
state
wanted
money,
i
think
that
we
might
very
well
take
that
position.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
if
they
say
that
they
do
not
want
any
money,
we
are
not
going
to
give
them
any
money.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
again
if
the
state
said
that
it
did
not
want
it
and
secured
jurisdiction
in
that
manner,
we
would
not
see
any
reason.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
as
i
say,
there
is
a
single
reference
to
grant-in-aid
programs
in
both
committee
reports.
justice
o'connor,
not
all
changes
to
administration
of
grant-in-aid
programs
involve
seeking
money
from
the
federal
government.
a
good
example
is
bowen
v.
kendrick,
which
this
court
heard
just
last
month.
that
certainly
is
a
challenge
to
the
federal
government's
administration
of
the
grant-in-aid
program.
there
is
a
contention
that
the
statute
under
which
that
program
is
administered
violates
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
you
in
several
respects.
certainly,
the
claims
court
and
the
federal
circuit
can
give
considered
judgment
to
these
things.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
certainly,
the
claims
court
and
its
appellate
court,
the
federal
circuit,
can
give
considered
judgment
to
these
matters.
there
is
nothing
less
competent
about
the
claims
court
and
the
federal
circuit
than
about
the
district
courts
and
the
regional
courts
of
appeal.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
is
correct,
of
course,
your
honor.
but
also,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
claims
court
and
the
federal
circuit
is
to
centralize
certain
matters.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
but
then
will
go
to
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
there
are
policy
arguments
that
can
be
made
to
some
of
these
cases
in
various
places.
there
are
also
policy
arguments
that
can
be
made
in
favor
of
centralizing
all
large
money
claims
against
the
united
states
in
one
court.
and
that
is
what
we
think
that
the
tucker
act
and
the
apa
dovetail
to
do.
the
apa
waiver
specifically
excludes
actions
for
money
damages.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
a
literal
reading
of
that
language
would
not
necessarily
by
itself
foreclose
jurisdiction.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
but
there
are
two
other
things
that
work
here.
one
is
the
overall
intent
of
congress,
which
we
do
think
is
to
put
money
cases
in
one
place
and
non-money
cases
in
the
other.
and
the
other
is
section
704,
which
allows
a
non-statutory
review
which
is
what
we
have
here
only
when
there
is
no
other
adequate
remedy
in
a
court.
and
a
money
action
in
the
claims
court
certainly
is
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals,
which
did
not
address
section
704,
thought
that
it
was
appropriate
to
entertain
the
so-called
declaratory
aspects
of
this
case.
it
affirmed
what
it
called
a
declaratory
judgment,
merely
because
the
grant
appeals
board
decisions
are
precedents.
that
is
the
only
significant
prospective
effect,
as
the
court
called
it,
that
there
was
that
justified
the
splitting
of
the
claim
into
two
courts.
but
all
judicial
decisions
are
precedents.
the
claims
court
decision
on
the
money
claim
would
be
a
precedent.
and
if
the
claims
court
agreed
with
massachusetts,
the
grant
appeals
board
decision
would
be
reversed
just
as
effectively
as
it
was
by
the
district
court.
the
remedy
that
exists
in
the
claims
court
is
perfectly
adequate.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
on
the
issue
in
our
petition,
the
claim
splitting
issue,
that
we
think
that
it
is
quite
clear.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
on
that
issue,
that
is
correct.
and
also,
our
overall
perception
of
the
intent
of
congress,
which
has
one
statute
which
has
been
on
the
books
since
1887
that
allows
money
actions
to
be
brought
against
the
federal
government,
and
another
statute
that
excludes
money
damages
with
a
lot
of
legislative
history
backing
it
up.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
is
correct,
the
issue
was
not
addressed.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
but.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
secretary
has
decided
as
a
matter
of
policy
not
to
pursue
objections
to
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
of
course,
that
is
not
something
that
we
could
not
bind
the
court
to
accept
jurisdiction
by
making
that
unfortunate
statement,
and
it
was
resolved
on
the
merits
by
the
district
court.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
it
can
be
made
in
an
absolute
sense
for
any
and
all
cases
for
all
times.
certainly,
there
are
categories
of
cases.
and
we
think
that
grant
disallowance
cases
involving
crude
monetary
claims
are
a
category
of
cases
in
which
that
claims
court
remedy
will
in
all
cases,
we
would
think,
be
adequate.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
even
though
prospective
relief
is
sought.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
because
it
is
not
the
government's
position
that
matters,
but
it
is
the
court's
position
that
matters.
and
when
the
claims
court
in
adjudicating
the
money
claim
decides
an
issue
of
law,
that
is
binding
upon
the
federal
government
in
all
future
dealings
with
the
same
party.
the
claims
court
is
a
perfectly
competent
court
to
address
these
issues,
as
it
has
in
medicare
cases,
and
in
other
kinds
of
judicial
review
actions
in
the
past.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
page
eight
of
the
senate
report,
and
also
page
nine
of
the
virtually
identical
house
report.
the
sentence
is,
"the
doctrine
has
been
invoked
in
hundreds
of
cases
each
year
concerning.
"
the
doctrine
meaning
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity,
"has
been
invoked
in
hundreds
of
cases
each
year
concerning
agricultural
regulations,
governmental
employment,
tax
investigations,
postal
rate
matters,
administration
of
labor
legislation,
control
of
subversive
activities,
food
and
drug
regulation,
and
administration
of
federal
grant-in-aid
programs.
"
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
would
have
been
our
position,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
we
have
acknowledged
that
judge
bork
rested
his
entire
analysis
on
that
snippet
of
legislative
history.
and
we
acknowledge
that
many
grant-in-aid
cases
would
involve
money
claims.
but
our
position
is,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
tucker
act
would
have
been
the
appropriate
vehicle
for
money
claims
in
grant-in-aid
cases
before
and
after
the
amendment.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
that
is
a
proper
construction.
in
candor,
i
have
to
say
that
you
can
trace
that
reference
back
to
two
cases
cited
in
professor
cramton's
memorandum
for
the
administrative
conference.
and
those
were
not
preenforcement
challenges
to
regulations.
they
were,
as
we
read
them,
challenges
to
deferral
of
action
on
grant
applications
by
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
that
is
how
we
read
them.
our
opponents
read
them
differently.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
that
such
cases
would
arise,
but
that
would
be
a
different
case
from
this
one.
this
one
is
a
case,
justice
kennedy,
in
which
the
only
prospective
effect
that
the
court
of
appeals
identified
was
that
the
grant
appeals
board
stood
as
precedence.
and
the
only
prospective
relief
that
any
court
granted
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
so
much
of
the
judgment
below
as
constitutes
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
secretary's
blanket
special
education
exclusion
is
in
excess
of
statutory
authority.
in
other
words,
that
was
the
underlying
issue
that
the
claims
court
would
have
resolved,
and
the
district
court
did
resolve,
but
the
claims
court
would
have
resolved
if
this
money
case
had
been
brought
there
in
the
first
place.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
the
government
can
be
collaterally
estopped
under
the
stauffer
chemical
and
montana
cases.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no.
we
think
that
the
usual
rule
is
that
when
an
action
is
brought
in
one
court,
and
then
a
separate
claim
is
split
from
that
and
brought
in
a
separate
court,
that
the
plaintiff
loses
all
right
to
proceed
on
that
separate
claim.
it
is
complicated
here,
because
the
plaintiff--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
doubt
that
we
would
have
a
lot
of
luck
in
the
claims
court,
that
we
would
not
concede
the
point.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
of
course.
but
the
premise
of
justice
kennedy's
question
was
that
this
court
affirmed
the
first
circuit
in
its
reasoning.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
court
did
set
aside
the
money
judgment.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
on
the
grounds
that
our
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
correct.
that
the
court
to
enter
money
judgments
against
the
united
states
is
the
claims
court.
and
that
the
other
than
the
money
damages
provision
of
the
apa
excludes
this
action
from
district
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
the
problem
would
not
be
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
justice
stevens,
i
said
in
the
context
of
a
question
whose
underlying
premise
was
the
state
brought
an
action
in
which
it
disclaimed
the
right
to
monetary
relief.
it
was
so
important
to
the
state
to
get
into
the
district
court
rather
than
the
claims
court,
that
the
state
was
willing
to
forego.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
in
the
context
of
this
case
in
which
the
state
has
never
made
any
secret
of
the
fact
that
it
wants
the
money,
and
this
court
accepted
jurisdiction
and
held
against
us;
no,
of
course,
we
would
pay
the
money.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
point,
justice
stevens,
is
that
we
might
make
the
collateral
estoppel
argument,
but
we
would
be
foolish
to
reargue
the
merits
in
the
claims
court,
which
of
course
would
be
bound
by
this
court's
disposition
of
the
merits.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
justice
stevens,
my
answer
to
the
questions
about
collateral
estoppel
is
that
we
would
argue
against
collateral
estoppel,
so
that
we
could
relitigate
in
the
claims
court.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
right,
and
we
would
pay.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
a
district
court
said
to
the
plaintiff,
drop
your
monetary
claims
so
that
you
can
stay
here,
with
the
intent
that
the
plaintiff
would
recover
money
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we
think
that
is
a
vast
conscious
evasion
of
the
jurisdictional
scheme
that
congress
has
created.
we
also
think
that
it
is
precluded
by
section
704.
because
the
person
who
wants
that
money
can
pursue
his
action
for
that
money
in
the
claims
court.
the
claims
court
and
federal
circuit
are
not
and
never
have
been
specialized
subject
matter
courts.
the
tucker
act
is
not
subject
matter
specific.
there
are
limitations
on
what
actions
can
brought
under
the
tucker
act,
but
they
depend
on
the
form
of
the
relief
sought
and
whether
there
exists
a
money
mandating
statute,
not
on
general
subject
matter.
the
tucker
act
like
the
apa
cuts
across
all
subject
matters.
finally,
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
relevant
to
any
issue
before
this
court
whether
the
states
have
to
come
to
washington
to
litigate
or
not.
but
for
what
it
is
worth.
28
u.s.c.
44
allows
the
federal
circuit
to
sit
anywhere
that
any
court
of
appeals
can
sit.
28
u.s.c.
173
allows
the
claims
court
to
sit
anywhere
in
the
nation.
thank
you.
