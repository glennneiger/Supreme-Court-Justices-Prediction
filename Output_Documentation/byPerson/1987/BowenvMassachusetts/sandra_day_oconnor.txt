justice
o'connor
now
mr.
englert,
there
is
a
split
of
authority,
is
there
not,
in
courts
of
appeal
about
whether
money
damages
means
compensatory
damages
or
whether
it
refers
to
the
tucker
act,
any
money
relief
question?
justice
o'connor
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
takes
the
view
that
money
damages
does
not
mean
what
you
say
it
means
in
that
statute?
justice
o'connor
so
that
is
really
the
crux
of
what
we
need
to
focus
on,
i
suppose,
in
this
case.
justice
o'connor
why
do
you
suppose
that
congress
did
not
use
language
like
is
used
in
the
tucker
act
if
they
intended
it
to
mean
the
same
thing?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
that
judge
bork
in
his
opinion
for
the
cadc
found
some
legislative
history
the
other
way.
justice
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
on
that
point.
does
a
state
in
the
position
of
massachusetts
have
any
ability
to
prevent
recoupment
by
the
government
during
the
appeals
process,
so
that
they
would
not
be
in
the
position
of
needing
to
ask
for
the
money
back?
justice
o'connor
so
in
your
view
as
a
practical
matter,
a
state
will
always
be
in
the
position
of
having
to
seek
money
damages
in
effect,
and
always
be
channeled
to
the
court
of
claims
in
any
of
these
grant
programs.
so
that
when
they
want
an
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language,
in
the
government's
view,
they
are
always
going
to
be
channeled
to
the
court
of
claims.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
englert,
there
is
some
legislative
history,
as
you
have
acknowledged,
that
indicates
that
congress
did
expect
these
grant-in-aid
programs
to
be
decided
in
the
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeal.
justice
o'connor
oh,
yes.
but
most
of
these
issues
come
up
and
involve
money.
that
is
why
the
states
are
worried
about
it,
and
that
is
why
the
grantees
are
worried.
and
there
is
certainly
some
indication
that
congress
thought
that
these
issues
were
better
resolved
in
the
crucible
of
the
federal
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeal
where
they
can
give
a
considered
judgment
to
these
questions.
and
to
channel
all
of
that
stuff
to
the
claims
court
just
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
troublesome
view
of
the
matter.
justice
o'connor
no,
but
it
is
often
very
helpful,
of
course,
to
have
different
circuit
courts
of
appeal
focusing
in
on
some
very
tough
issues
that
we
get.
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
what?
justice
o'connor
mr.
englert,
let
me
also
ask
you
whether
you
think
that
the
704
adequate
remedy
question
or
determination
should
be
made
case
by
case
or
on
the
basis
of
categories
of
things?
justice
o'connor
even
though
prospective
relief
is
sought?
justice
o'connor
and
even
though
you
might
have
changing
administrations,
and
new
administrators,
and
different
policies
in
the
future.
and
you
just
think
that
people
ought
to
be
foreclosed
from
getting
that
prospective
relief
order.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
barnico,
in
this
case
now,
the
district
court
did
not
issue
an
injunction,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
it
did
not
enter
an
injunction,
did
it?
justice
o'connor
and
you
take
the
position
that
to
be
adequate
that
the
relief
requires
an
injunction,
and
that
is
why
it
does
not
meet
the
standards
of
704
and
should
not
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
right?
justice
o'connor
and
yet
you
ask
us
at
the
same
time
to
reinstate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
which
did
not
issue
an
injunction.
so
how
in
this
case
do
you
find
that
it
was
not
adequate?
justice
o'connor
so
in
this
case,
the
relief
in
the
court
of
claims
might
well
be
adequate
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
barnico,
i
take
it
that
you
do
not
urge
the
adoption
of
the
line
drawn
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
that
money
damages
refers
to
a
sum
of
money
used
as
compensatory
relief,
you
are
not
urging
that
line?
