justice
scalia
right,
and
you
had
explicit
testimony
by
the
lawyer
saying
that
we
like
this
jury,
we
didn't
think
we
could
get
a
better
jury.
we
liked
it
because
it
had,
what,
nine,
eight
or
nine
women,
which
they
thought
was
highly
desirable.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
before
you
go
on,
all
of
those
motions
would
have
produced
not
just
a
different
jury
here
and
now,
but
a
different
jury
elsewhere,
right,
or
a
different
jury
at
a
different
time?
justice
scalia
that
is
not
one
of
the
lawyers,
that
is
somebody
who
said
he
was
talking
to
one
of
the
lawyers.
right?
justice
scalia
and
he
said
that
that
lawyer
said...
what
were
the
exact
words?
how
did
he
say
it?
justice
scalia
well,
i
think
it's...
here.
justice
scalia
well,
it
says...
is
it
the
quote
that
says,
"well,
i
can't
say
specifically.
"
"i
don't
think
he
told
me
what
he
would
have
done.
"
"i
think
he
just
said
that
it
was--
"
--no,
it's
the
one
that
says,
"if
i
had
known
about
this
jury
issue
prior
to
trial
i
would
have
raised
it.
"
i
can't
find
it.
where
is
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
bright,
this
was
a
white
defendant,
right?
justice
scalia
so
it
is
not
at
all
implausible
that
the
composition
of
the
jury...
what
was
the
percentage
of
blacks
on
it?
justice
scalia
yes,
the
ultimate
jury.
justice
scalia
six
and
six.
and
eight
or
nine
women?
justice
scalia
do
we
know
which?
we
don't
know.
it
was
either
eight
or
nine.
justice
scalia
it
is
not
at
all
implausible
that
that
was
indeed
quite
satisfactory
to
this
white
defendant.
justice
scalia
there
was
some
evidence,
was
there
not,
of
prior
offenses
that
this
individual
had
committed
against
blacks
which
might
indeed
cause
him
to
prefer
a
jury
with
fewer
blacks
rather
than
more?
justice
scalia
and
you
had
the
express
statement
by
his
lawyer
that
they
made
the
tactical
decision
not
to
challenge
it,
even
though
they
thought
that
had
they
challenged
it,
they
might
well
have
won.
justice
scalia
and
the
only
explicit
statement
you
set
up
against
that
is
somebody's
recollection
that
he
said
it'd
been
a
great
issue
if
i'd
known
about
it.
that
isn't
even
a
categorical
statement
that
i
would
have
raised
it
if
i
had
known
about
it.
it
would
have
been
a
great
issue.
justice
scalia
is
that
the
universe
of
things?
it
is
either
concealed
or
readily
discoverable?
the
opposite
of
concealed
is
readily
discoverable?
i
can
think
of
things
that
are
not
concealed
but
may
not
be
readily
discoverable.
doesn't
concealed
require
some
affirmative
action
on
somebody's
part?
justice
scalia
they
must
have
wanted...
you
just
don't
file
a
motion
for
continuance
without
a
reason
for
it.
didn't
they
give
a
reason
for
the...
why
did
they
want
the
continuance?
justice
scalia
so
the
assumption
that
that
was
just
a
motion
to
get
time
for
time's
sake
is
not
valid,
and
just
because
they
wanted
a
continuance
for
that
purpose
doesn't
mean
that
they
would
seize
upon
any
device
to
give
them
more
time.
presumably
they
wanted
the
continuance
for
a
valid
reason.
justice
scalia
ms.
boleyn,
i
think
that's
a
close
call.
if
indeed
you
had
hearsay
testimony
that
said
they
would
have
raised
it...
do
you
have
hearsay
testimony
that
said
they
would
have
raised
it?
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
say
they
would
have
raised
it.
in
fact,
jernigan
had
been
asked
earlier,
what
did
taylor
say
about
his
prior
knowledge,
and
what
he
would
have
done,
and
jernigan
answers,
well,
i
can't
say
specifically.
i
don't
think
he
told
me
what
he
would
have
done.
justice
scalia
i
think
he
just
said
it
was
a
great
issue.
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
where
it
is
in
the
appendix.
i
am
looking
at
the
record.
it
is
on
59
of
the
record.
i
am
not
sure
it
is
in
the
appendix.
maybe
it
is.
justice
scalia
the
"yeah,
i
recall
that"
might
be
taken
to
mean,
i
recall
his
saying
he
would
have
raised
it
but
for
the
fact
that
he
had
said
earlier
specifically,
i
don't
think
he
told
me
what
he
would
have
done.
i
think
he
just
said
that
it
was
a
great
issue,
i
wish
i'd
known
it.
so
there
is
not
even
any
hearsay
that
explicitly
says
he
would
have
raised
it.
justice
scalia
well,
you
don't
want
to
do
that.
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
scalia
i
thought
that
that
was
determined
in
another
trial.
i
mean,
as
an
abstract
matter
i
suppose
you
could
argue
that
the
numbers
were
to
make
sure
that
the
number
of...
that
the
proportion
of
blacks
did
not
go
below
these
numbers,
so
that
they
wouldn't
be
subject
to
a
court
challenge
and
he
couldn't
care
less
if
they
went
well
above
those
numbers.
i
suppose
you
could
create
that
speculation.
but
i
thought
that
this
had
been
determined
in
an
earlier
case
that
it
was
indeed
malicious.
justice
scalia
are
you
saying
that
they
assumed
that...
they
assumed
that
one
of
the
jurors
had
been
bribed.
no,
no,
no.
well,
why
isn't
that
what
would
be
parallel
to
this
case.
justice
scalia
well,
i
didn't
understand
you
to
be
saying
that.
justice
scalia
but
that
would
be
the
parallel.
they
say,
yes,
i
figure
pretty
well
one
of
these
jurors
is
bribed,
but
this
looks
like
a
pretty
good
jury
to
me,
let's
go
with
it.
