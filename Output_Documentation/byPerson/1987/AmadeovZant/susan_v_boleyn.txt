ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
existence
of
the
memo
which
has
been
the
subject
of
great
discussion
before
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
is
only
relevant
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case
if
the
memorandum
played
some
part
in
the
strategy
decision
that
petitioner's
trial
attorneys
made,
so
the
pivotal
inquiry
for
this
court
to
make
is
what
the
attorneys
knew,
when
they
knew
it,
and
what
important
factors
they
knew
about
the
grand
jury
that
called
them
to
make
the
decision
to
forego
the
challenge.
the
overall
strategy
of
the
trial
attorneys
was
to
attempt
to
avoid
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
on
mr.
amadeo.
mr.
amadeo
had
confessed,
and
they
had
him
dead
to
rights.
the
only
thing
they
could
do
would
try
to
be
to
obtain
a
sympathetic
jury
who
would
not
impose
the
death
penalty.
in
order
to
do
this,
of
course,
under
georgia
law
the
only
thing
they
really
needed
to
try
to
concentrate
on
was
to
get
one
sympathetic
person,
because
the
death
penalty
has
to
be
unanimous
in
georgia,
so
their
whole
trial
strategy
throughout
the
entire
proceeding
was
to
attempt
to
avoid
the
death
penalty.
they
didn't
just
blindly
try
to
do
this,
though.
they
went
and
investigated
the
actual
traverse
jury
list
to
determine
if
there
were
people
on
that
list
who
would
be
beneficial
to
them
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
death
penalty.
they
went
to
local
attorney
dallas
veal,
who
had
practiced
in
this
particular
county
for
a
very
long
time,
and
they
went
over
name
by
name
the
people
on
the
list
to
determine
their
characteristics
and,
as
mr.
lambert
said,
any
significant
factor
that
these
particular
jurors
might
have
with
reference
to
trying
to
avoid
the
death
penalty.
they
went
over
the
fact
of
their
age,
their
sex,
any
job
that
they
might
have,
and
of
course
tried
to
determine
their
church
preference
based
on
some
other
particular
factors
they
were
trying
to
get.
one
of
the
major
reasons
they
believed
and
relied
upon
the
jury
as
being
beneficial
to
mr.
amadeo
is
the
fact
that
there
was
an
active
religious
charismatic
group
in
putnam
county
that
had
a
very
large
following,
and
in
fact
some
of
the
members
of
that
church
had
actually
visited
the
petitioner
in
jail
prior
to
his
trial,
and
of
course
because
of
their
conscientious
objection
to
the
death
penalty
and
because
of
their
sympathy
toward
the
defendant,
the
attorneys
both
said
that
they
wanted
these
people
to
be
on
the
actual
jury
that
would
be
drawn
for
the
trial
jury.
another
consideration
that
they
had,
of
course,
was
that
the
district
attorney
had
served
notice
prior
to
trial
that
they
would
introduce
other
crimes,
and
the
victims
of
the
other
crimes
in
alabama
were
black
persons.
there
was
violence
against
black
persons.
there
was
a
beating
and
a
murder
and
a
robbery
of
these
black
persons,
and
the
attorneys
feared
that
a
jury
which
contained
numerous
black
people
might
be
unsympathetic
to
the
19-year-old
white
defendant.
not
only
this,
they
wanted
to
select
jurors
for
the
traverse
array
who
might
have
children
the
same
age
as
the
petitioner
or
who
might
be
mothers.
they
felt
they
would
be
more
lenient.
having
looked
at
this
120
people
name
by
name
with
another
local
attorney,
both
mr.
lambert
and
mr.
pryor
said,
and
i
quote,
"we
feel
very
comfortable
with
the
jury.
"
"we
felt
like
we
had
a
very
good
jury.
"
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
your
honor,
they
made
a
reasonable
assumption
that
the
jury
was
challengeable
and
could
be
challenged
successfully.
they
did
not
go
and--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--they
assumed
the
statistics
would
establish
the
intentional
nature
of
the
discrimination.
they
assumed
the
statistics
would
be
sufficient
to
show
that.
that
was
an
assumption
that
they
made.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
they
were.
in
effect--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--right,
but
the
crucial
thing,
of
course,
is
that
the
memorandum
didn't
cause
them
not
to
make
the
challenge.
if
they
had
gone
and
looked
at
the
numbers
and
said,
it's
a
close
case,
maybe
we
shouldn't
file
it
because
it's
a
close
case,
then
you
might
have
some
interference
between
the
memo
and
the
attorneys'
decision,
but
what
they
did
was,
saying,
we're
assuming
that
we
can
successfully
challenge
both
the
grand
and
traverse
jury
lists,
and
of
course
the
only
thing
they
could
gain
from
that
was
not
an
acquittal
of
the
defendant,
and
not
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
death
penalty.
the
only
thing
they
could
gain
was
delay.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
your
honor,
i
believe--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--they
filed
a
motion
for
continuance,
but
the
basis
of
that
motion
was
not
to--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
what
it
is,
they
filed
numerous
motions
to
protect
themselves
on
various
fronts.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
sir.
they
filed
a
motion
for
change
of
venue,
and
they
filed
a
motion
for
the
continuance,
but
there
were
numerous
reasons
cited
therein,
and
of
course
it
is
not
unfamiliar
for
trial
attorneys--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--if
they
had
known
of
the
defect
they
could
have
obtained
the
continuance?
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
but
they
never
said
they
wanted
a
continuance.
in
their
testimony
in
the
district
court
they
never
said
that
they
needed
more
time
for
any
purpose.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
making
reference
to
their
testimony
before
the
district
court.
they
never
said
that
the
motion
for
continuance
deprived
them
of
any
time
or
facilities
or
resources
to
make
any
other
challenges
they
wanted
to.
it
wasn't
necessary.
it
was
just
part
of
a
list
of
motions
that
they
filed
to
try
to
protect
his
rights.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
what
they
said
in
the
continuance
motion
was,
they
wanted
more
time
to
wait
until
the
psychiatric
report
came
back
from
central
state
hospital,
that
they
wanted
to
interview
people
out
of
state
because
these
three
defendants
were
from
out
of
state--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes,
your
honor.
my
point
is,
i
think,
that
they're
not
incompatible.
the
filing
for
the
motion
for
continuance
and
the
decision
not
to
challenge
the
array
are
not
incompatible.
i
mean,
trial
attorneys
often
file
numerous
motions
to
protect
various
rights
that
they
may
need
as
the
time
goes
by,
and
of
course
the
essential
point
is
on
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
is
that
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
was
not
ruled
on
until
after
voir
dire
was
completed.
so
what
they
were
essentially
doing
was
hedging
their
bets
and
seeing
if
the
beneficial
jury
they
believed
that
they
had
had
any
fixed
opinions,
they'd
still
be
able
to
take
them
off
based
on
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
or
exclusion
on
the
peremptory
challenges.
so
they
carried
through
with
their
actual
strategy
of
trying
to
obtain
a
beneficial
jury
both
in
the
way
that
they
conducted
voir
dire
and
the
way
that
they
preserved
all
their
motions
until
after
the
voir
dire
had
been
completed.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
there
would
not
have
been.
they
probably
would
have
had
to
specially
empanel
a
new
jury
if
it
went
beyond
the
term
of
courts
but
that
would
not
inevitably
result,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
don't
believe
that's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
have
been...
they
could
have
tried
him
within
the
same
term,
because
they
only
asked
for
a
three-week
continuance,
is
my
recollection.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
let
me
correct
myself,
your
honor.
i
believe
they
asked
for
a
continuance
until
march,
and
he
was
tried
in
november.
i
believe
i
stand
corrected
on
that.
i
believe
the
continuance
was
from--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--i
think
there
are
three
juries
per
year
in
that
county,
as
i
recall,
three.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
think
it's
four
months,
each
for
four
months
is
what
i
believe
it
is,
but
i'm
not
certain
of
that.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
think
what
they
do
is
rotate
the
different
judges
within
the
circuit
to
the
particular
county
where
you
have
it.
some
of
them,
i
believe--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
sir.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
they
had
the
first
order
prior
to
the
time
the
trial
attorneys
testified,
your
honor,
and
then,
of
course,
they
entered
the
oral
or
if
you
will
after
the
remand
had
taken
place.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
the
attorneys
carried
out
their
trial
strategy
to
try
to
get
a
beneficial
array
by
voir
diring
the
jury
about
the
various
factors
that
i
have
mentioned.
they
asked
them,
did
they
go
to
church,
what
church
they
went
to.
they
asked
them,
did
they
have
children
the
same
age
as
the
defendant,
and
they
asked
them,
of
course,
about
any
predilection
that
they
had
for
the
death
penalty.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
they
exercised
all
but
two
of
their
ten
peremptories.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
no,
they
didn't,
but
they
required
that
the
district
attorney
exhaust
all
20
of
his.
excuse
me.
i
am
correcting
myself.
they
exhausted
all
but
two
of
their
peremptories.
the
district
attorney
exhausted
all
of
his.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
your
honor,
perhaps
i
wasn't
clear.
i
said
the
only
other
order
was
the
one
before
the
remand,
and
that
is
the
one
at--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
the
attorneys
went
through
a
weighing
process
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
challenge
the
master
grand
and
traverse
jury
lists.
what
they
did
was
weigh
the
advantages
they
could
gain,
which
were
solely
delay,
versus
the
advantage
they
could
gain
if
they
stay
with
the
beneficial
jury
that
they
have.
essentially
what
they
did
was
say
that
a
bird
in
the
hand
was
worth
two
in
the
bush,
and
of
course
they
were
operating
on
the
assumption
that
they
would
win.
as
mr.
pryor
testified,
we
will
gain
delay
if
we
win.
on
the
other
hand,
we
had
already
been
through
these
juries
that
we
had,
jurors
that
we
had
one
at
a
time.
we
balanced
these
two
factors
and
decided
not
to.
he
also
indicated
that
he
was
afraid
we
would
"wind
up
in
worse
shape
than
we
were.
"
so
he
made
the
strategic
decision
that
the
most
beneficial
jury
to
this
particular
defendant
could
be
obtained
from
the
list
that
had
already
been
drawn
up
and
from
the
actual
list
that
he
had
been
provided.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
your
honor,
the
bases
for
the
district
court's
opinion
were
these.
first,
they
found
it
was
reasonable
for
the
attorneys
not
to
have
known
of
the
memorandum,
and
that,
of
course,
was
not
a
clearly
erroneous
assumption
of
fact.
but
the
major
clearly
erroneous
fact
that
the
district
court
found
in
finding
cause
was
that
there
was
concealment
and
that
the
concealment
played
a
part
in
the
tactical
decision
that
the
attorney
made.
the
eleventh
circuit
overturned
that
finding
as
being
clearly
erroneous
and
found
that
the
memorandum
was
readily
discoverable,
and
because
it
was
discoverable
the
attorneys
chose
not
to
go
and
look
for
it,
and
chose
to
rely
on
their
assumption
that
the
challenge
would
be
successful,
that
there
really
was
essentially
no
nexus
between
the
memorandum
and
its
concealment
or
nonconealment
and
the
attorneys'
decision
not
to
challenge--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--your
honor,
in
the
first
order
of
the
district
court
we
contend
the
filing
findings
are
clearly
erroneous.
at
joint
appendix
page
79,
judge
owen
says
the
failure
to
assert
the
issue
at
trial
was
not
deliberate.
we
contend
that
that
is
clearly
erroneous.
the
second
finding
on
ja79
of
the
first
order
is
that
he
said
the
attorneys
were
justified
in
assuming
that
the
attack
upon
the
jury
would
be
futile.
in
fact,
they
did
not
believe
it
would
be
futile.
they
believed
it
would
be
successful,
and
that
finding
is
clearly
erroneous.
finally,
on
ja80
the
court
said
that
it
was
a
miscarriage
of
justice
to
overlook
the
intentional
act
of
underrepresentation
based
solely
on
the
rule
of
procedure,
and
of
course
that
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law
that
we
say
is
clearly
erroneous.
with
respect
to
the
second
order
of
the
district
court,
the
district
court
said
from
a
cause
standpoint
it
was
reasonable
for
lambert
and
pryor
at
the
time
they
were
appointed
to
not
challenge
the
list.
of
course,
the
reasons
why
it
was
reasonable
are
our
assertions.
we
disagree
with
the
district
court
on
what
the
reasons
for
not
challenging
it
were,
but
we
don't
contest
the
reasonableness
of
their
decision
overall.
the
other
two
findings
that
we
contend
were
clearly
erroneous
is
judge
owen's
finding
on
ja92
that
if
they
had
known
of
the
memorandum
they
would
have
challenged
the
box.
we
contend
that--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
your
honor,
what
you
had
was,
you
had
the
two
trial
attorneys
at
the
time,
of
course,
present
before
the
district
court,
and
they
didn't
testify
that
if
they
had
had
the
memorandum
they
would
have
known
it,
but
yet
two
other
people
talking
to
them
recollected
that
back
in
1978
they
thought
that
that's
what
they
had
said,
so
you
are
balancing
hearsay
testimony--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
what
it
is.
the
only
thing
is,
he
is
not
able
to
credit...
hearsay
testimony
has
no
probative
value,
so
he
is
unable
to
credit--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--the
hearsay
of
mr.
jernigan?
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
it
is.
he
should
not
have
credited
hearsay
testimony
over
the
testimony
of--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--your
honor,
a
fact
can
be
clearly
erroneous
even
if
there
is
some
evidence
to
support
it.
the
only
evidence
to
support
the
district
court's
finding
was
hearsay
testimony.
we
say
that
that
is
clearly
erroneous
in
the
light
of
the
attorney's
direct
testimony,
which
did
not
include
the
statement
that
if
they
had
known
about
the
memo
that
they
would
have
raised
it,
so
that
finding
is
clearly
erroneous.
even
if
it
is
supported,
allegedly
supported
by
hearsay
testimony,
that
is
still
a
clearly
erroneous
finding
by
the
district
court.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
only
that
portion
that
the
court
noted
before
of
mr.
jernigan's
testimony.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
what
they
rely
upon,
your
honor,
what
they
have
always
relied
upon
is
ja60,
where
they
ask
mr.
jernigan
after
he
has
first
said,
i
don't
remember
what
he
said,
then
they
ask
him
again,
on
cross
said,
asked
him
the
leading
question;
"do
you
recall
mr.
lambert
ever
saying
to
you,
if
i
had
known
about
this
jury
issue
prior
to
trial
i
would
have
raised
it.
"
he
says,
"yeah,
i
recall
that.
"
"it'd
have
been
a
great
issue
if
i'd
known
about
it.
"
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
your
honor.
what
they
did
was
misconstrue
his
recollection
as
a
specific
recollection
that
that
is
exactly
what
he
said,
and
that
is
what
the
district
court
relied
on
as
clearly
erroneous,
so
i
was
just
giving
it
the
best
premise
possible,
and
still
say
even
at
best
it
is
just
hearsay.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
think
our
bottom
line
position
on
this,
your
honor,
is
that
the
memo
has
no
relevance
in
this
case
because
it
was
not
a
basis
for
the
trial
attorneys'
deliberate
decision,
and
this
is
borne
out
in
the
manner
in
which
they
finally
did
raise
their
challenge.
both
mr.
pryor
and
mr.
lambert
testified
that
they
raised
the
jury
issue
on
direct
appeal
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
solely
because
they
said
we
had
lost
in
mr.
amadeo's
case
and
we
wanted
to
raise
every
issue
we
could
raise,
and
of
course
at
that
time,
you
know,
the
trial
was
over
and
we
were
reaching
for
straws
and
doing
everything
we
could
to
try
to
follow
through,
so
they
had
had
an
unsuccessful
trial
strategy
that
they
thought--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--i
think
the
allegations
and
the
nature
of
the
memo
are
very
serious,
but
the
question
is--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
and
that
is
a
very
serious
contention.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
that
is
a
very
serious--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--the
jury
boxes
were
kept
separately?
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
know
that
that
evidence
came
out
in
bailey
v.
vining,
but
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge,
whether
they
were
separately
kept
as
to
voting
purposes.
i
don't
know.
but
the--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--that
is
what
we
contest.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
it
was
in
the
relevant
public
record,
your
honor,
along
with--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--in
the
master
jury
list,
not
just
in
a
stack
of
papers
but
in
the
master
jury
list.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
it
was
in...
the
clerk
testified...
well,
excuse
me.
mr.
coates
testified
that
when
he
went
and
asked
the
clerk
for
relevant
materials
to
challenge
the
master
jury
list
for
a
period
of
time,
the
clerk
directed
him
to
where
the
master
jury
lists
were
kept.
he
gave
him
the
actual
document
that
consisted
of
the
master
jury
list,
and
in
going
through
that
he
found
the
memorandum.
interestingly--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes.
by
the
trial
attorneys,
had
they
looked
at
the
master
jury
list,
but
of
course
they
didn't.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
your
honor.
in
light
of
mr.
coates'
testimony,
the
person
that
found
it,
the
question
was
specifically
put
to
him
whether
he
thought
he
would
have
recognized
it
if
he
wasn't
making
a
broad-based
attack
on
the
jury
discrimination
system.
he
said,
yes,
i
think
i
would
have
known
about
it
anyway.
he
only
had
one
year
experience
at
the
time
that
he
found
it.
mr.
pryor
and
mr.
lambert
had
25
years
of
experience.
so
he
did
recognize
what
the
memo
had
of
significance
even
though
he
happened
to
be
making
a
review
of
it
in
the
broad
sense.
i
think
to
an
attorney
examining
the
master
jury
list,
the
relevant
document
for
purposes
of
challenge,
they
would
have
recognized
the
significance
of
it.
if
it
had
been
contained
in
an
irrelevant
public
source,
then
that
might
be
a
whole
different
question.
they
didn't
have
to
subpoena
the
records.
the
clerk
voluntarily
gave
them,
pointed
him
to
it,
and
he
even
said,
mr.
coates
testified
that
when
he
went
and
took
the
memorandum
to
mr.
dennis,
the
clerk,
that
the
clerk
said,
yes,
that's
what
it
is.
he
confirmed
that
it
came
from
the
solicitor's
office
to
the
jury
commissioners,
to
mr.
coates.
so
not
only
was
there
no
state
interference
with
it,
but
they
in
fact
confirmed
what
it
was.
if
they
had
really
wanted
to
conceal
the
document
they
should
have
left
it
in
the
district
attorney's
office
under
lock
and
key,
but
instead
it
is
with
the
relevant
public
document,
so
that
any
attorney
making
any
kind
of
challenge
to
the
jury
in
putnam
county
has
access
to
that
document
as
well
as
any
other
person.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
no.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
there
is
no
evidence--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--no.
of
course
not.
you
can't
say
that.
the
clerk
said
he
placed
it
in
the
public
record,
the
clerk
did.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
so
it's
the
clerk's
action,
not
the
prosecutor's
action,
that
caused
it
to
be
in
the
public
record.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
your
honor--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--i
think
the
point
to
be
made
about
that
is
first
of
all
that
the
record
is
not
as
complete
as
the
petitioner
says
that
it
is.
what
the
record
shows
is
that
the
memorandum
came,
was
sent
from
the
solicitor's
office
to
mr.
dennis,
who
was
the
clerk
of
the
jury
commissioner,
and
it
was
given
to
the
jury
commission
itself
by
the
clerk,
and
mr.
dennis
did
say
that
the
members
of
the
jury
commission
to
his
knowledge
attempted
to
comply
with
the
numbers
placed
on
that
memorandum.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
that
is
the
previous
name
for
the
district
attorney,
the
solicitor's
office.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
they
are
the
same
thing.
solicitor
and
district
attorney
are
the
same
thing.
what
is
not
in
the
record
and
what
mr.
coates
and
mr.
wright
and
mr.
jernigan
all
say
is,
these
theories...
they
even
characterize
them
as
theories,
as
to
what
this
meant.
there
was
an
attempt
to
make
it
look
good
but
not
really
be
truly
representative.
all
that
is
inference
and
speculation
because
there
is
no
direct
evidence
in
the
record
on
that.
we
know
where
it
came
from.
we
know--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes,
they
do.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
and
it
of
course
resulted
in
minimal
disparities,
your
honor,
10
percent
for
one
and
5.1
percent
for
the
other,
which
of
course
is
very
minimal
even
if
you
are
trying
to
discriminate.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
why
do
i
suppose...
what
is
my
speculation?
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
the
same
as
theirs
is,
your
honor.
the
same
as
theirs.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
the
prosecutor
never
testified.
we
don't
know
if
he
sent
it.
all
the
clerk
said
is,
it
came
from
his
office.
and
there's
no
evidence
in
bailey
v.
vining
that
he
sent
it.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
he
sent
it.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
that's
right.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
sir,
that's
what
we
know.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
we
don't
know,
your
honor.
we
don't
know.
providing
them
with
some
numbers
about
how
to
reconstitute
the
list,
but
for
what
purpose,
that's
what
the
speculation
and
the
innuendo
is.
whether
it
was
concealment,
whether
it
was
a
covert
scheme,
whether
it
was
with
all
this
malicious
intent,
that
is
the
speculation
of
all
the
attorneys
that
represented
the
state
or...
yes,
the
state
in
bailey
v.
vining
and
represented
the
petitioner
here.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
your
honor,
i
am
not
contesting
that
that
memorandum
came
from
the
solicitor's
office.
that
has
been
previously
determined.
what
i
am
contesting
has
never
been
decided
either
in
bailey
v.
vining,
the
separate
civil
action,
or
in
this
case
are
the
motives
of
the
prosecution,
whether
it
was
pursuant
to
a
scheme,
and
whether
it
was
a
deliberate
intent
to
underrepresent
black
people.
yes,
it
had
that
effect.
that's
what
bailey
v.
vining
says.
and
we
are
stuck
with
it
for
whatever
it
is
worth.
but
all
the
deliberate
nature
of
this
prosecutor
is
what
has
never
been
proven
and
has
always
been
inferred.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
no,
your
honor.
the
action
in
bailey
v.
vining
was
against...
originally
against
the
electoral
representatives,
and
then
against
the
jury
commissioners
themselves.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
he
is,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
because
they
at
all
times
assumed
it
would
be
successful,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
because
they
at
all
times
assumed
it
would
be
successful.
they
never...
they
never
thought
it
would
be
futile.
they
never--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--they
said
general
knowledge
in
the
legal
community,
that
it
statistically
wasn't
right,
and
also
general
knowledge
that
if
you
went
far
back
enough
in
georgia
that
you
were
going
to
find
an
underrepresentation
of
blacks
in
the
grand
and
traverse
juries.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
they
never
went
and
looked
at
the
statistics.
they
just
assumed
that
they
would
be
challengeable
and
they
would
show
intent
themselves.
they
didn't
actually
go
and
make
a
determination
of
what
the
statistics
were.
they
just
assumed
that
they
would
be
corrected
based
on
their
general
legal
knowledge
of
the
community.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
they
were,
your
honor,
because
that's
how
mr.
coates
got
them,
was
going
to
the
clerk's
office
himself
and
doing
the
tabulations,
and
then
he
presented
those
in
bailey
v.
vining.
our
position
is
that
there
has
never
been
a
sufficient
showing
of
cause
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
that
the
attorneys
made
an
intentional,
deliberate
strategical
decision,
albeit
one
that
failed,
to
go
with
an
advantageous
jury
array
and
not
to
file
what
they
believed
would
be
a
successful
challenge
to
the
grand
and
traverse
juries
which
would
only
buy
them
delay
and
would
not
keep
the
death
penalty
from
being
imposed
upon
the
petitioner.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
it
could
be,
your
honor.
it
depends
on
how--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--because
i
think,
your
honor,
first
of
all
you
have
to
look
at
what
they
assume.
if
the
attorneys
in
your
hypothetical
assumed
that
they
could
successfully
challenge
it
without
the
bride?
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
then
that
would
be
a
reasonable
strategic
decision,
the
fact
that
they
didn't...
they
thought
that
they
had
an
element
of
proof.
they
didn't
think
they
needed
it.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
it
depends
on
whether
the
reasonableness,
you
know,
whether
there
was
ineffectiveness
for
not
knowing
about
the
bribe
or
something
like
that.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
if
they
assumed...
if
they
assumed--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--if
they
also
assumed
that
they
could
challenge--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--it
would
still
be
a
reasonable
strategic
decision
that
would
not
be
caused,
as
long
as
they
assume
that
they
can
be
successful--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--the
decision
would
be--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--that
is
what
i
thought
i
was
saying,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
no,
perhaps
i
was--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--and
the
key
inquiry
whether
if
they
think
they
need
an
element
of
proof
that
they
don't
have
for
whatever
they
are
trying
to
show,
then
there
you
would
have
the
nexus.
you'd
have
the
cause
and
effect
between
the
lack
of
knowing
about
the
bribery,
in
this
case
the
lack
of
knowing
about
the
challengeability
of
the
jury
and
the
decision,
but
the
key
part
comes
in,
of
course,
when
you
assume
that
you
have
all
the
elements
of
proof
you
needed,
and
they
assumed
they
would
have
the
evidence
of
intentional
discrimination
based
on
statistics
if
they
looked
at
them.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
your
honor,
but
they
had
more
to
base
their
assumption
on
in
this
case.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
no,
your
honor.
they
said
that
if
you
went
back
far
enough
in
georgia,
in
any
county
in
georgia
where
there
was
not
a
prior
jury
challenge,
you
were
going
to
find
underrepresentation
of
blacks
on
the
jury,
so
it
was
more
than
just
some
general
statistical
legal
technician
sort
of
notion.
it
was,
they
were
sure.
they
had
practiced
law
there
for
25
years
and
known
there
was
never
a
previous
challenge,
and
figured
if
you
go
back
far
enough
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
find
that
underrepresentation
of
blacks
on
the
jury
probably
in
statistics
high
enough
to
show
the
intent
without
the
necessity
of
any
memo
or
anything
else
showing
the
element
of--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--well,
that's,
of
course,
the
way
you
look
at
it.
the
way
you
show
discrimination
in
this
one
is
to
show
systematic
exclusion
over
a
significant
period
of
time,
so
that's
the
same
sort
of
analysis
you'd
have
to
go
in
to
try
to
attack
the
individual
jury.
the
eleventh
circuit
did
not
reach
prejudice,
but
let
me
just
state
that
we
have
never
conceded
that
there
was
sufficient
prejudice
under
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard.
what
we
did
concede
is
that
the
bailey
v.
vining
order
established
underrepresentation
of
blacks.
there
was
nothing
we
could
do
about
that,
but
whether
or
not
that
constitutes
prejudice
should
this
court
reach
that
question
is
still
open
for
the
decision.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
