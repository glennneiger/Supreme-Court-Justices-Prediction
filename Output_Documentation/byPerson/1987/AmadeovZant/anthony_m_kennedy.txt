justice
kennedy
do
you
interpret
the
district
court's
opinion
as
finding
that
the
trial
lawyer
were
not
credible?
justice
kennedy
so
that
their
statement
that
they
made
a
deliberate,
knowing
waiver
of
the
jury
challenge
is
not
credible?
justice
kennedy
the
latter
motion
was
just
to...
was
to
change
the
county,
however,
right?
justice
kennedy
which
means
a
different
county
altogether.
justice
kennedy
but
that
doesn't
contradict
the
idea
that
this
might
have
been
the
best
jury
they
could
have
had
in
that
county.
justice
kennedy
did
i
mishear
you?
did
you
say
that
this
was
easily
discoverable?
justice
kennedy
yes,
would
you,
please,
because
it
was
in
the
stack
of
the
papers
that
was
voluntarily
delivered,
and
the
clerk
testified
exactly
what
it
was.
justice
kennedy
well,
there
is
no
finding
that
the
memorandum
was
hidden.
in
fact,
just
the
opposite,
isn't
it?
the
memorandum
was
delivered
promptly
when
anybody
requested
it.
at
the
first
request
they
got
the
stack
of
papers
and
it
included
the
memorandum.
justice
kennedy
if
the
motion
for
continuance
had
been
granted,
is
counsel
for
the
state
correct
that
there
would
necessarily
have
been
a
new
jury
array?
justice
kennedy
do
we
know
the
dates
of
the
expiration
of
the
jury?
justice
kennedy
so
a
three-week
continuance,
you
are
representing,
would
not
necessarily
result
in
a
new
jury
array?
justice
kennedy
do
the
juries
run
on
a
calendar
year,
do
you
know?
justice
kennedy
wasn't
that
based
on
the
testimony
of
jernigan?
justice
kennedy
which
was
hearsay
testimony,
no
quite
as
reliable
as
lambert's
own
testimony,
but
that
is
for
the
trial
judge,
isn't
it?
justice
kennedy
but
that's
for
the
trial
judge,
isn't
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
was
the
hearsay
objected
to?
justice
kennedy
it
is
in
the
record,
then,
isn't
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
now,
that's...
is
there
a
rule
that
you
cannot
credit
hearsay
testimony
over
direct
testimony,
especially
when
the
person
testifying
on
direct
has
an
interest
in
the
testimony,
namely,
these
attorneys'
interest
in
not
being
sued
for
malpractice?
justice
kennedy
what
is
the
basis
for
your
saying
that
the
trial
court
was
wrong
in
finding
that
the
petitioner's
counsel
were
justified
in
assuming
that
an
attack
upon
the
jury
would
be
futile?
justice
kennedy
because
they--
justice
kennedy
--and
what
did
they
base
that
assumption
on?
justice
kennedy
in
other
words,
the
statistics
on
their
face
show
about
the
same
disproportion
that
were
shown
in
the
memo?
justice
kennedy
were
those
statistics
easily
demonstrable
other
than
from
the
memo?
