justice
stevens
was
that
the
testimony
of
the
lawyers
or
some
other
lawyers?
where
are
those
statements?
justice
stevens
can
you
tell
me
one
detail
of
the
procedure
of
selecting
the
jury?
how
did
the
persons
in
the
clerk's
office,
whoever
did
it,
who
selected
the
juries
know
which
jurors
were
black
and
which
were
white?
justice
stevens
of
course,
they
were
wrong
on
that,
weren't
they?
justice
stevens
so
they
didn't
know
the
real
basis
for
a
valid
challenge.
justice
stevens
which
is
one
of
the
things
they
sought
unsuccessfully,
was
delay,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
they
did
file
a
motion
that
would
have
resulted
in
delay.
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
one
of
the
things
as
a
matter
of
tactics
they
wanted
was
delay.
justice
stevens
three
motions,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
and
is
it
not
clear
that
had
they
known
of
this
defect
in
the
grand
jury
selection
they
clearly
could
have
obtained
a
continuance?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
i
thought
you
agreed
they
did
file
a
motion
for
a
continuance.
justice
stevens
ms.
boleyn,
would
you
help
me?
you
responded
to
the
chief
justice
by
saying
the
only
opinion
of
the
disrict
court
was
at
90
and
93.
isn't
this
material
at
67
to
81
the
district
court's
opinion,
or
71
to
81?
that
was
a
written
opinion
where
he
found--
justice
stevens
--which
is
a
full
explanation
of
cause
and
prejudice,
that
written
opinion.
justice
stevens
i
thought
the
district
court
found
otherwise.
why
was
that
clearly
erroneous?
justice
stevens
so
you
agree
that
we
couldn't
uphold
setting
aside
the
district
court's
decision
unless
we
agreed
that
it
was
clearly
erroneous
that
there
had
been
concealment.
you
acknowledge
that
as
far
as
the
other
points
are
concerned
the
district
court's
decision
was
not
clearly
erroneous,
specifically
on
whether
they
would
have
used
this
information
had
they
known
about
it.
justice
stevens
well,
do
you
think
this
issue
is
just
a
straw
issue?
isn't
this
a
rather
serious
issue?
i
mean,
let's
be
candid
about
that.
justice
stevens
and
the
facts
are
serious.
justice
stevens
this
actually
happened.
this
isn't
just...
you
know,
often
we
get
complaints
alleging
things
and
we
assume
them
for
purposes
of
trial.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
evidence
discloses
an
intentional
program
of
rigging
the
jury
by
the
prosecutor's
office.
justice
stevens
and
they
even
used
jury
lists
that
were
segregated
by
race.
justice
stevens
and
was
that
commonly
known,
that
that
was
being
done?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
so
that
by
and
large
they
would
not
have
been
charged
with
notice
that
this
was
going
on,
so
even
if
the
memorandum
were
not
concealed,
the
plan
was
concealed,
was
it
not?
justice
stevens
you
contest
that
the
plan
was
concealed?
justice
stevens
how
was
anyone
to
find
out
about
that
if
they
didn't
bump
into
this
memorandum
and
ask
a
lot
of
questions?
justice
stevens
in
a
stack
of
papers.
justice
stevens
but
do
you
seriously
think
that
the
district
attorney's
office
wanted
that
document
to
be
found?
justice
stevens
so
that
if
they
knew
where
it
was,
they
surely
would
have
recaptured
it,
wouldn't
they?
justice
stevens
so
you
can't
say...
maybe
the
clerk
certainly
testified
truthfully
and
all,
but
you
can't
say
the
prosecutor's
office
wasn't
guilty
of
concealment.
the
whole
plan
was
to
conceal.
justice
stevens
correct.
justice
stevens
but
the
prosecutor
is
the
adversary
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
it's
not
the
clerk
we
are
concerned
about
here.
justice
stevens
no,
but
the
percentages
do
fit,
don't
they?
justice
stevens
and
the
district
judge
was
persuaded
by
that.
justice
stevens
just
a
little
bit
pregnant.
0
[generallaughter.]
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
more
than
that,
because
if
you
are
going
to
infer
deliberate,
malicious
intent
of
the
prosecutor
to
underrepresent
black
people
on
the
jury,
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
say,
try
to
get
as
close
as
he
could
to
what
was
truly
representative
and
only
be
5
percent
off.
so
i
think
the
percentages
are
relevant
if
you
are
going
to
infer
all
these
malicious,
deliberate,
intentional
decisions
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor--
--why
do
you
suppose
they--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
supposing
they
made
the
strategic
decision
this
was
the
best
jury
they
could
get,
and
afterwards
they
found
out
that
one
of
them
had
been
bribed
to
return
a
guilty
verdict.
but
they
didn't
know
it,
but
they
made
a
strategic
decision.
would
that
be
cause?
justice
stevens
why
would
that
be
different,
because
they
thought
they
had
a
good
jury.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
and
they
later
on
found
there
was
a
bribe.
would
they
be
barred
from
raising
that
then?
justice
stevens
they
just
didn't
look
at
the
memo
that
said,
we
bribed
this
juror
that
was
hiding
over,
you
know,
was
in
the
clerk's
office.
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
stevens
they
just
didn't
know
about
it,
and
they
could
have
found
it
out
if
they
had
really
been
diligent
and
careful,
but
they
didn't,
and
they
thought
they
had
the
best
jury
they
could
get.
they
just,
you
know,
they
had
one
bad
juror.
justice
stevens
yes,
they
assumed...
they
made
all
those
assumptions
and
decided,
well,
let's
just
go
ahead
with
this
jury.
justice
stevens
they'd
be
stuck
with
that
jury.
justice
stevens
their
assumption
of
the
bribery
would
just
be
based
on
the
notion,
we
know
we've
got
a
crooked
prosecutor
here
who
probably
bribes
people.
we
probably
can't
prove
it,
but
maybe
we
could.
that
would
still...
they
would
still
be--
justice
stevens
--but
they
didn't.
the
statistics
here
would
have
not
supported
a
challenge.
there
was
nothing.
there
was
just
an
assumption
they
had
a
general
notion
they
might
be
able
to
prevail.
justice
stevens
but
that
is
past
juries,
not
this
jury.
