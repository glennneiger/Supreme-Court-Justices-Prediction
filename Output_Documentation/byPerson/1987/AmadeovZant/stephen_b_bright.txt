mr.
stephen
b.
bright
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
matter
which
is
before
the
court
now
is
a
habeas
corpus
case
that
is
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
my
client,
tony
amadeo,
is
a
death
sentence
petitioner.
he
was
sentenced
to
death
in
georgia,
in
putman
county,
georgia,
in
november
of
1977,
some
two
months
after
the
incident
for
which
he
was
charged
with,
he
and
his
two
co-defendants
were
charged
with
the
crime.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
it
is
not
far
from
macon,
georgia,
in
the
center
of
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--more
in
the
central
part
of
the
state,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
right
about
on
the
nat
line,
your
honor.
and
at
the
start
of
the
penalty
phase
of
mr.
amadeo's
trial,
the
prosecutor,
the
district
attorney
said
that
you
probably
couldn't
find
a
fair
jury
anywhere
in
the
state
of
georgia
than
you
could
find
in
putman
county.
of
course,
he
was
the
only
one
who
knew
at
the
time
he
made
that
statement
that
he
had
earlier
that
same
year
directed
the
jury
commissioners
in
putnam
county
to
underrepresent
black
people
and
women
in
the
master
jury
lists
from
which
tony
amadeo's
grand
jury
and
trial
juries
were
chosen.
it
was
unknown
that
at
that
time
he
had
put
forward
this
plan,
these
instructions
to
the
jury
commission
for
the
purpose
of
making
it
appear
that
racial
discrimination
had
been
eliminated
while
actually
perpetuating
racial
discrimination
and
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
gender
and
insulating
it
from
judicial
review.
ten
months
after
mr.
amadeo's
trial
this
scheme
came
to
light
when
another
lawyer
in
another
case
inadvertently
came
across
it.
he
attempted
to
raise
it
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
that
court
rejected
his
claim,
saying
it
came
too
late.
he
later
presented
it
to
the
district
court
below,
and
that
court
granted
habeas
corpus
relief,
finding
cause
that
the
claim
was
not
reasonably
available
to
mr.
amadeo
and
his
lawyers
at
the
time
because
it
was
concealed
and
unknown
to
them
because
of
the
district
attorney's
deception.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
your
honor,
that
was
one
of
two
factual
determinations
that
the
district
court
made
which
the
eleventh
circuit
rejected.
basically
the
district
court,
if
you
look
at
the
one
lawyer's
testimony
that
is
highlighted
throughout
the
state's
brief,
it
gives
a
view
of
this
case
of
a
tactical
decision
that
was
made.
the
district
court--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--he
was
one
of
two
counsel,
right,
and
they
were
appointed
to
represent
both
mr.
amadeo
and
the
two
co-defendants
in
all
three
of
these
cases,
but
the
district
court
looked
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
clearly
did
not
credit
that
testimony,
because
the
district--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--yes,
your
honor.
the
district
court's
finding,
of
course,
was
that
the
lawyers
would
have
brought
the
claim
had
they
known
about
the
district
attorney's
involvement
in
this
scheme
to
eliminate
or
to
limit
black
people
and
women
on
the
jury.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
the
ultimate
jury.
now,
of
course,
the
lawyers
said
that
what
they
did
was,
they
got
the
venue
list,
that
is,
the
people
chosen
from
the
master
list
for
the
petit
jury
in
that
trial,
and
they
looked
at
that
before
trial,
and
saw
that
there
were
women
and
black
people
represented
there.
of
course,
that's
exactly
what
the
district
attorney's
scheme
was
designed
to
accomplish.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes,
and
there
are
a
number
of
sources
of
that
that
they
would
have
brought
the
challenge,
and
let
me
go
through
those,
if
i
may.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
be
happy
to.
first
of
all,
the
lawyer's
testimony
which
we
were
talking
about
there
and
relates
to
this
point
is
that
they
liked
that
particular
jury.
what
the
district
court
had
that
directly
contradicted
that
was
all
the
contemporaneous
evidence,
the
first
thing
being,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
the
lawyers
filed
a
motion
to
continue
this
case
october
the
27th
and
filed
an
affidavit
saying
that
there
was
so
much
prejudice
against
mr.
amadeo
and
his
co-defendants
that
the
trial
should
not
be
held
until
the
next
term
of
court,
which
would
have
been
before
a
different
jury.
in
addition,
the
lawyers
filed
a
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
which
was
litigated
right
through
the
jury
selection
process,
and
they
argued
in
that
motion
that
a
large
portion
of
the
jurors
had
an
opinion
about
the
guilt
of
mr.
amadeo
and
therefore
that
they
should
not
try
the
case
before
that
particular
jury.
these
lawyers
only
filed
three
motions
prior
to
trial.
those
were
two
of
the
three
motions,
which
were
to
get
another
jury
at
another
time.
in
their
brief
to
the
georgia
supreme
court,
and
this
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
i
would
point
the
court
to
pages
16
to
18,
and
i
might
mention
to
respond
to
the
chief
justice
on
the
page
cites--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--the
continuance
motion
would
have
produced
a
different
jury
but
in
the
same
county.
the
venue
motion,
of
course,
would
have
moved
the
case
out
of
putnam
county
in
a
completely
different
venue.
both
of
these
contradict
this
testimony
that
the
lawyers...
of
course,
this
was...
when
they
testified,
this
one
lawyer
that
has
been
alluded
to,
ten
years
after
the
fact
the
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
when
this
allegation
was
made
that
we
really
liked
this
jury
so
much,
we
would
have
done
anything
to
keep
it,
even
forfeit
a
constitutional
claim.
in
addition,
and
i
was
going
to
say,
both--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--well,
of
course,
they
didn't
know
they
had
this
claim.
all
they
said
was--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--yes,
you
can
find
that
he
said
this.
he
didn't
actually
know
that
there
was
a
factual
basis
for
the
claim.
his
testimony
was,
we
thought
there
was
so
much
discrimination
that
went
on
in
that
part
of
georgia
that
if
we
had
probably
looked
we
probably
would
have
found
something,
and
we
didn't
look.
that's
what
he
testified
to.
of
course,
that's
much
different,
knowing
that
you
might
undertake
in
the
two
months
you
have
to
prepare
three
capital
trials--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--all
right.
i
think
the
district
court
made
its
finding
based
upon
the
contradiction
based
upon
what
i've
already
talked
about,
the
brief
that
those
lawyers
filed
in
the
georgia
supreme
court--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
no,
your
honor.
well,
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
that's
what
he
testified
to--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--right.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well,
if
it's
a
different
position,
the
fact
that
it
was
taken
after
the
trial
may
be
an
explanation
for
it,
but
it
is
a
contradiction.
it
was
one
of
those
contradictions
that
the
district
court
had
to
resolve
in
making
its
factfinding.
i'm
not
saying
that
there's
not
a
plausible
view
of
the
evidence
that
can
be
taken
in
the
state's
brief
or
in
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion,
but
the
district
court
is
entrusted
with
the
factfinding
responsibility
under
rule
2,
and
the
district
court
not
only
considering
the
things
that
i've
talked
about
but
also
considering
the
testimony
of
the
lawyers
at
the
time
they
found
out,
ten
months
later
after
this
trial
when
this
district
attorney's
involvement
in
limiting
the
black
people
and
women
on
the
juries
first
came
to
light,
the
testimony
of
the
two
lawyers
then
of
the
shock,
the
statements
that
the
claim
would
have
been
brought
had
it
been
known,
and
the
fact
that--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--one
of
those
statements,
mr.
coates,
when
he
told
mr.
lambert
about
it,
"i
wish
we
had
known,
we
would
have
raised
that
issue.
"
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
47.
mr.
jernigan
testified
that
when
he
spoke
to
mr.
lambert
about
it
he
recalled
mr.
lambert
saying
they
would
have
raised
it.
that's
at
page
59
and
60.
if
you
look
at
the
brief
that
was
filed
in
the
georgia
supreme--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--right.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
i'm
not
sure
if
i
have
the
exact
words,
but
i
believe
that--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--mr.
jernigan
was
asked
if
he
recalled
mr.
lambert
saying,
had
they
known
about
this
claim,
would
they
have
raised
it,
and
mr.
lambert
said
that
they
would
have,
and
that's
at
the
bottom
of
page
59,
the
top
of
page
60
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
the
quote
is,
and
this
is
at
the
bottom,
justice
scalia,
of
page
59,
"mr.
jernigan,
do
you
recall
mr.
lambert
ever
saying,
if
i
had
known
about
this
jury
issue
prior
to
trial
i
would
have
raised
it.
"
and
then
on
the
next
page,
"yes,
i
recall
that.
"
"he
said
it
would
have
been
a
great
issue,
i
would
have
raised
it
if
i'd
known
about
it.
"
and
again,
the
eleventh
circuit
in
footnote
9
of
its
opinion
acknowledged
a
direct
conflict
in
the
testimony
here.
what
the
district
court
under
rule
52(a)
was
required
to
do
was
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
not
just
what
one
lawyer
testified
to
ten
years
after
the
fact,
but
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
contemporaneous
evidence,
i
would
submit,
indicates
support
for
the
district
court's
finding.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
no,
he
was
speaking
when
he
made
that
statement
that
i
just
quoted,
justice
blackmun,
he
was
talking
about
the
prosecutor's
memorandum
that
indicated
that
he
had
designed
a
plan
to
limit
blacks
and
women
and
avoid
a
prima
facie
case
by--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
exactly.
i'm
sorry.
i
did
misunderstand,
and
that's
the
point,
of
course,
the
dissent
makes
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
that
whatever
the
lawyers
might
have
been
thinking
about
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
because
the
facts
had
been
withheld
from
them,
was
not
the
claim
which
was
here,
that
their
adversary,
the
district
attorney,
who
under
georgia
law
has
no
responsibility
to
interact
with
the
jury
commission
at
all.
the
jury
commission
is
to
receive
its
instructions
from
the
superior
court
judge
and
only
from
the
superior
court
judge.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
would
point
as
well
as
another
basis
for
the
district
court's
finding,
without
going
through
each
part
of
it,
the
brief
that
was
filed
in
the
georgia
supreme
court
at
pages
16
to
18
of
the
joint
appendix,
with
regard
to
how
this
claim
was
first
found
and
what
the
lawyer
did
upon
finding
it,
and
with
regard,
justice
o'connor,
to
the
question
about
deliberate
bypass,
i
think,
as
the
district
court
found,
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
that
once
this
was
discovered,
once
the
prosecutor's
actions
here
were
discovered,
it
was
immediately
presented
to
the
state
courts
as
promptly
as
it
could
possibly
have
been
presented,
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
declined
to
entertain
the
claim,
but
that
these
lawyers
basically
did
all
that
they
could
possibly
do.
i
would
point
out
that
when
the
district
court
heard
this
it
took
into
account
the
briefs
and
the
continuance
motion
which
were
marked
and
made
a
part
of
the
evidence,
all
of
that
was
part
of
the
factfinding
process,
and
i
would
suggest
that
under
anderson
versus
bessemer
city,
pullman-standard,
and
the
other
cases
that
this
court
has
decided,
that
the
eleventh
circuit
could
not
reject
that
factfinding
without
making
a
finding
that
it
was
clearly
erroneous,
and
i
would
point
out--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--i
think
he
resolved
conflicting
evidence
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
would
have
raised
the
claim
had
they
known
of
this
constitutional
violation,
that
the
district
attorney
was
engaged
basically
in
a
criminal
conspiracy
with
the
jury
commissioners
to
limit
the
participation
of
blacks
and
whites.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well,
two
points
on
that.
first
of
all,
whatever...
and
i
think
the
district
court
considered
this
because
he
asked
them
something
about
the
nature
of
that
challenge.
whatever
it
was
they
decided
was
not
the
claim
that
is
presented
here,
because
they
didn't
know
about
it.
they
did
not
make
a
knowing
tactical
decision
based
on
all
the
available
information,
because
the
information
was
hidden
from
them.
in
fact,
the
whole
nature
of
this
plan
was
to
deceive
them
into
thinking
that
there
was
sufficient
representation
of
women
and
blacks,
that
this
really
wasn't
worth
wasting
the
time
on
to
try
to
raise
a
challenge
like
this.
but
secondly,
i
think,
given
the
passage
of
time
and
all
the
other
factors
that
the
district
court
could
take
into
consideration,
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
it
did
resolve
this
conflict
in
the
testimony
by
finding
that
they
would
have
raised
the
claim.
and
i
would
suggest
that
based
upon
all
the
points
that
i
have
gone
through,
that
finding
is
supported
by
the
record.
and
again,
i
think
the
question
under
rule
52(a),
is
that
a
plausible
reading
of
the
record,
are
the
district
court's
factfindings
plausible,
and
i
would
submit
that
they
certainly
are,
and
that
they
are
not
clearly
erroneous,
and
that
the
eleventh
circuit,
the
key
errors
that
the
eleventh
circuit
made
here
was
in
rejecting
the
finding
that
it
was
clearly
erroneous...
excuse
me,
rejecting
it
without
making
the
finding
that
it
was
clearly
erroneous,
and
of
course
since
it
is
supported
by
the
record,
it
can't
be
done,
and
i
would
point
out
as
well
that
nowhere
has
the
state
in
either
the
eleventh
circuit
or
before
this
court
argued
that
the
factfindings
of
the
district
court
are
clearly
erroneous.
and
i
think
besides
the
one
which
we
have
touched
upon
or
talked
about,
the
tactical
decision
argument
that
the
state
has
made
based
upon
that
selective
use
of
mr.
pryor's
testimony,
two
other
factfindings
are
critical,
one,
the
discriminatory
purpose
of
the
plan,
which
really
had
not
been
contested
until
we
got
to
this
court,
and
then
second
the
concealment
point,
and
i
would
like
to
just
talk
briefly
about
each
of
those,
if
i
may.
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
the
state
says
these
are
target
figures,
and
at
one
point
in
their
brief
they
even
say
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
the
author,
the
purpose,
or
to
whom
this
plan
was
submitted,
and
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted.
the
clerk
of
the
court,
mr.
dennis,
testified
that
he
received
the
note
from
the
district
attorney
to
the
jury
commissioners
for
the
purpose
of
telling
them
how
many
blacks,
women,
and
young
people
were
to
be
put
on
the
master
jury
lists.
he
as
secretary
of
the
commission
communicated
this
knowledge
to
the
chairman,
and
the
testimony
was
that
they
followed
it.
and
indeed
in
the
district
court
the
state
conceded,
and
i
quote,
"intentional
discrimination
on
the
uncontroverted
evidence
that
was
produced
in
bailey
versus
vining.
"
which
was
the
case
in
which
this
scheme
first
came
to
light,
and
of
course
the
district
court
findings
in
both
the
bailey
case
and
the
district
court
findings
below
in
this
case
are
that
it
was
a
plan
to
bring
about
intentional
discrimination
with
the
purpose
of
avoiding
a
prima
facie
case
to
set
the
level
of
discrimination
at
just
such
a
place
that
it
would
insulate
it
from
judicial
review,
and
therefore
deny
litigants
the
opportunity
to
challenge
it
and
be
successful.
really,
the
fundamental
question,
it
seems,
on
this
case,
is
who
put
this
case
in
the
posture
that
it
is
in
today?
why
is
this
claim
brought
to
the
district
court
after
the
pretrial
hearings
and
after
the
trial
in
state
court?
and
the
answer
to
that
has
to
be
the
district
attorney
in
this
case.
there
is
a
lot
of
argument
about
whether
the
lawyers...
what
they
wanted
to
do
or
should
have
looked
have
looked
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
over
at
the
clerk's
office,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
district
attorney
knew
exactly
what
had
happened.
he
could
have
stood
up
at
arraignment
and
said,
i
just
want
to
put
on
the
record
i
have
instructed
the
jury
commission
to
underrepresent
black
people
and
women
in
the
master
list,
and
once
everyone
recovered
from
the
shock,
you
would
assume
that
the
same
thing
would
have
happened
there
that
happened
when
this
came
out
in
bailey
versus
vining
before
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
said,
stop
trying
people
for
criminal
cases
until
you
revise
your
jury
list
there,
because
what
you
are
doing
is
patently
unconstitutional.
with
regard
to
the
concealment
point,
again,
using
this
court's
language
in
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
on
the
ultimate
jury
that
was
chosen?
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
was
six
black
and
six
white.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well,
it's
not
implausible,
but
i
think
what
we
know
now
which
we
didn't
know
at
the
time
is
that
this
basically
was
a
jury
selected
through
a
clearly
unconstitutional
and
illegal
scheme.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
that
was
one
consideration
put
forward
by
one
of
the
lawyers.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes,
and
of
course
we
have--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--oh,
no,
but
that
is
not
the
only
thing,
justice
scalia,
that
contradicts
that.
their
testimony
was,
we
wanted
this
jury,
but
they
filed
a
continuance
motion
in
which
they
indicated
they
did
not
want
that
jury.
they
filed
a
motion
for
a
venue
in
which
they
said
there
was
so
much
prejudice
in
that
jury
that
they
didn't
want
to
be
tried
before
that
jury.
so
there
is
direct
contradiction,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
noted
in
footnote
9,
between
those
two
versions,
and
that
was
for
the
district
court
to
resolve.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
to
change
the
venue,
yes,
to
another--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--yes,
which
would
have
meant
that
it
wouldn't
be
before
this
jury,
which
contradicts
certainly
the
testimony--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--well,
maybe
the
venue
question
does
not,
although
i
would
submit
that
counsel's
affidavit
saying
that
the
jury
was
so
prejudiced
against
them
certainly
contradicts
the
testimony
that
the
jury
was
so
good
that
they
would
forego
some
other
challenge,
but
again,
i
think
the
challenge
that
they
thought
they
were
foregoing
is
a
completely
different
question
than
what
the
claim
that
they
actually
had
in
this
particular
case.
they
thought
they
might
spend
that
month
before
trial
trying
to
put
together
some
sort
of
statistical
challenge.
that
is
completely
different
from
knowing
that
your
adversary
is
involved
with
the
jury
commissioners
in
manipulating
the
list
to
keep
people
off.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
by
county.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes,
jury
commissioners.
right.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
they
maintained
the
lists
separately
by
race.
the
district
court
makes
that
finding
in
one
of
its
orders,
and
of
course
here
the
numbers
were
very
explicit.
he
told
him
to
put
101
black
people
on
the
grand
jury,
and
i
can't
remember
the
number,
but
he
told
them
an
exact
number
of
how
many
blacks
were
to
go
on
the
traverse
jury,
and
even
figured
out
the
percentages
to
make
sure
that
they
were,
you
know,
that
he
would
avoid
a
swain
challenge
based
on
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
casseel
versus
texas,
that
people
were
excluded,
and
i
suppose
as
well,
your
honor,
peters
versus
kiff
and
your
honor's
concurring
opinion
in
that
case
that
here
basically
in
violation
of
the
constitution
as
well
as
18
u.s.
code
243,
people
were
excluded
from
jury
service
based
on
race
and
gender
intentionally.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well,
it
would
have
been
at
the
trial
phase,
it
would
have
been
both,
both
a
cross-section
claim
and
a
discrimination
claim.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
excuse
me?
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--very
well.
i
will
back
off
of
that
and
just
say
it
would
have
been
a
discrimination
claim
because
there
was
intentional
discrimination.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
no,
it
was
both,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
both.
the
whole
jury...
there
are
two
separate
master
lists
that
are
maintained,
one
for
the
grand
jury
and
one
for
the
petit
jury.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
applied
to
both.
he
set
out
in
one
position
how
many
blacks
to
put
on
the
grand
jury,
and
in
another
part
of
that
same
little
note
how
many
to
put
on
the
traverse,
and
the
same
thing
for
women,
right
to
the
very
number.
and
with
regard...
i
just...
there
has
been
some
question
raised
about
whether
this
was...
this
memorandum,
which
was
nothing
but
just
a
yellow
sheet
from
a
legal
pad
type
thing
that
had
just
been
torn
out,
and
if
you
just
look
at
it...
it
is
set
out
in
the
joint
appendix
on
about
page
3
or
4,
it
is
nothing
but
a
collection
of
numbers
and
initials
and
a
few
words,
and
it
really
has
no
legal
significance,
just
to
look
at
it.
the
district
court,
of
course,
found
that
this
had
been
concealed.
there
is
no
reason
for
lawyers
to
know
about
it.
the
eleventh
circuit
again
rejected
that
factfinding,
made
its
own
factfinding
that
this
crumbled
sheet
of
yellow
paper
was
readily
discoverable,
and
i
would
point
out
the
support
for
the
district
court's
finding
first
of
all
and
most
fundamentally
is
in
georgia
law.
all
the
proceedings
of
a
jury
commission
in
georgia
are
secret.
the
jury
commissioners
take
an
oath
not
to
disclose
anything.
the
only
thing
that
is
available
after
the
jury
commission
meets
is
a
certified
copy
of
the
master
list.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
the
clerk
of
the
court
testified
that
he
received
this
from
the
district
attorney's
office
for
the...
and
he
was
the
secretary
to
the
jury
commission...
for
the
purpose
of
giving
it
to
the
commission,
and
he
gave
it
to
the
chairman,
and
they
followed
it
to
the
letter,
and
the
district
court
made
that
finding,
that
it
was
followed
to
the
letter.
the
way
in
which
it
all
was
found--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--no,
i
said
the
eleventh
circuit
erroneously
rejected
the
finding
that
it
was
concealed
and
found
that
it
was
readily
discoverable,
and
i
was
about
to
say
why
it
was
not.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
right.
of
course--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--yes,
and
of
course
what
the
district
court
found
here
was
the
whole
purpose
of
the
scheme
was
deception,
but
the
eleventh
circuit
juxtaposed
those
two
terms
in
terms
of
its
finding
and
the
district
court's
finding.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
i
think
what
the
record
clearly
shows,
though,
is
that
the
way
in
which
this
memorandum
came
out
was
totally
fortuity
and
inadvertent.
somebody
went
who
was
working
on
a
claim
that
the
at
large
voting
procedures
in
the
county
violated
the
constitution,
was
looking
for
a
history
of
discrimination,
went
through
30
years
of
jury
lists,
and
the
state
indicates
in
there
that
this
memorandum
was
with
this
master
jury
list.
there
is
absolutely
no
support
in
the
record
for
that.
he
said
somewhere
in
30
years
of
documents
this
yellow
sheet
is
there.
obviously
somebody
in
the
clerk's
office
didn't
realize
that
this
wasn't
for
public
consumption,
but
the
fact
that
somebody's
not
very
good
at
hiding
the
plan
does
not
mean
that
it
is
readily
discoverable.
first
of
all,
mr.
amadeo's
lawyers
had
no
earthly
reason
to
go
over
there
and
look
for
it.
the
work
product
of
the
jury
commission
under
georgia
law
is
secret.
it
is
not
available.
the
only
thing
you
can
get
is
the
list.
secondly,
there
was
no
basis
for
them
to
know
that
the
district
attorney
in
that
case
was
not
complying
with
georgia
law,
federal
law,
the
united
states
constitution,
the
ethics
of
prosecutors,
which
say
that
he
is
to
have
no
role
at
all
in
telling
the
jury
commission
how
to
go
about
its
work,
but
certainly
no
role
in
telling
them
how
to
limit
the
participation
of
cognizable
groups
on
the
jury.
so
there
was
no
reason
for
them
to
go
to
the
clerk's
office
and
look
for
this
needle
in
a
haystack
because
they
had
no
reason
to
know
that
it
existed
in
the
first
place.
and
finally,
again,
as
i
was
pointing
out
earlier,
just
the
nature
of
the
plan
itself
was
such
that
obviously,
if
you
publish
the
fact
that
you
are
about
discriminating
on
purpose,
that
plan
is
not
going
to
survive
for
very
long.
the
whole
nature
of
the
plan
was
to
discriminate,
hide
the
discrimination
from
public
view,
insulate
the
discrimination
from
judicial
review,
and
deny
defendants
any
chance
to
challenge
it.
that
couldn't
possibly
be
accomplished
if
it
was
public
knowledge.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
very
well.
i
would
just
point
to
the
record
very
quickly
on
the
prejudice
question.
the
state
said,
the
same
attorney
general,
that
prejudice
has
been
conceded
by
the
state
throughout
the
proceedings
because
of
the
intentional
discrimination
and
the
uncontroverted
evidence
in
bailey.
the
other
point
i
want
to
make
is
just
what
has
been
said
repeatedly
in
both
the
briefs
and
the
arguments,
that
this
is
speculation
and
inference
by
myself
or
in
our
brief
or
witnesses,
these
are
findings
of
a
united
states
district
court.
the
district
court
found
discrimination,
and
it
found
at
page
79
of
the
joint
appendix
that
it
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
a
prima
facie
case.
this
is
not
anybody's
speculation.
these
were
findings
that
a
district
court
could
make
based
upon
all
the
evidence,
and
i
would
just
point
out
as
well
with
regard
to
what
the
lawyers
would
have
done
that
when
mr.
coates
testified
at
page
47
of
the
record
he
talked
about
this
was
a
death
penalty
case,
we
had
a
hard
case,
and
i
wish
we
had
known,
because
we
were
looking
for
every
issue
to
raise,
when
he
testified,
so
it
wasn't
just
the
testimony
of
mr.
jernigan.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
i
think
the
evidence
was
established
at
least
from...
in
the
bailey
case
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
dennis,
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
secretary
to
the
jury
commission.
he
said,
i
got
this
from
the
district
attorney's
office,
i
communicated
it,
they
followed
it
to
the
letter,
and
the
district
court
made
those
findings.
why
the
state
didn't
call
the
prosecutor,
i
have
no
idea.
of
course,
he
did
have
a
valid
fifth
amendment
privilege,
but
i
don't
know
if
that's
the
reason.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
excuse
me?
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
we
certainly
did
not
need
the
prosecutor
in
this
particular
case.
and
finally,
with
regard
to
the
motions,
i
want
to
make
clear
there
were
three
motions
filed
prior
to
trial.
two
more
were
filed
on
the
day
of
trial,
but
there
were
three
filed
prior,
but
with
regard
to
that
continuance
motion,
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
was
filed
was
that,
and
the
lawyers
didn't
just
file
a
motion.
they
filed
an
affidavit,
and
they
swore
to
this
statement
that
there
was
so
much
passion
and
prejudice
in
the
community
that
they
needed
to
continue
the
case
to
the
next
term
of
court
so
that
the
passions
in
that
particular
jury
could
die
down,
and
if
they
had
gone
to
the
march
term
it
would
have
been
a
new
term
of
court.
for
all
these
reasons,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
eleventh
circuit
and
reinstate
the
district
court.
thank
you.
