justice
o'connor
mr.
bright,
the
district
court
here
concluded
that
petitioner's
counsel
at
the
time...
that
wasn't
you,
i
guess.
justice
o'connor
did
not
deliberately
bypass
the
constitutional
challenge
to
the
composition
of
the
master
jury
list.
justice
o'connor
now,
what
evidence
is
there
in
the
record
to
support
that
finding
in
the
face
of
what
appears
to
be
defense
counsel's
testimony
to
the
effect
that
defense
counsel
considered
challenging
the
jury
list,
thought
they
could
win
such
a
challenge,
but
chose
not
to
raise
it
in
order
to
preserve
what
they
thought
was
a
favourable
jury?
justice
o'connor
well,
tell
me,
please,
where
we
look
in
the
record
to
find
something
to
support
the
district
court's
contrary
view.
justice
o'connor
there
was
that
testimony
by
one
of
the
defense
lawyers?
justice
o'connor
right,
but
there
was
testimony,
i
thought,
by
at
least
one
of
them
to
the
effect
that
we
considered
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
master
list,
thought
we
might
have
won
it,
but
we
bypassed
it
because
we
thought
we
had
a
favorable
actual
jury.
is
that
right?
we
can
find
that
in
the
record.
justice
o'connor
okay.
all
right.
now
tell
me,
please,
where
we
find
in
the
record
something
contrary
to
that
statement
on
which
the
district
court
might
have
made
its
finding.
justice
o'connor
ms.
boleyn,
do
you
think
that
defense
counsel
were
actually
aware
of
the
basis
by
which
they
could
have
challenged
the
master
jury
list
for
this
statistical
discrepancy?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
they
made
an
assumption
that
it
could
have
been
challenged
because
of
the
intentional
discrimination
in
the
statistical
makeup?
justice
o'connor
how
so?
what
do
you
mean,
it
was
in
the
record?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
take
the
position
that
this
yellow
pad
sheet--
justice
o'connor
--could
reasonably
have
been
discovered.
justice
o'connor
i
just
wonder
how...
you
know,
i
looked
at
it
on
page
3,
and
i
think
if
i
had
seen
it
i
wouldn't
have
known
what
i
was
looking
at.
do
you
think
somebody
reasonably
would
have
known?
