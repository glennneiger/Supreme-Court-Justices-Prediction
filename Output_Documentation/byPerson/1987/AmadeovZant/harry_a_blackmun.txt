where
is
putnam
county,
what
part
of
georgia?
justice
blackmun
more
or
less
south
then?
justice
blackmun
below
the
nat
line?
justice
blackmun
and
he
was
only
one
of
more
than
one
counsel,
was
he
not?
justice
blackmun
mr.
bright,
let
me
ask,
wasn't
mr.
jernigan
speaking
about
statistical
disparity
when
he
made
that
statement?
justice
blackmun
i'm
trying
to
help
you
out,
but
i
guess
i'm
not
doing
it.
justice
blackmun
i
thought
he
was
speaking
of
the
statistical
disparity,
and
that
that
was
what
he
shied
away
from,
which
to
me
is
very
different--
justice
blackmun
--than
allegations
of
a
challenge
of
an
intentional
discrimination.
justice
blackmun
if
this
is
true,
i
think
it
utterly
destroys
this
talk
about
what
jernigan
said
as
being
something
that
there
is
no
answer
to.
i
think
there
is
a
complete
answer
to
it
in
the
record.
justice
blackmun
how
long
does
the
average
term
in
putnam
county
last?
justice
blackmun
and
you
fill
a
calendar
for
four
months,
keep
a
judge
there
for
four
months?
justice
blackmun

a
lot
of
business
then
in
putnam
county?
justice
blackmun
i
say
they
have
a
lot
of
business
in
putnam
county.
