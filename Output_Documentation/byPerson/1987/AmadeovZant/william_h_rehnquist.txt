chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
number
87-5277,
tony
b.
amadeo
versus
ralph
kemp.
mr.
bright,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
you
are
being
whipsaw.
you
are
getting
several
questions...
i
think
you
were
in
the
process
of
answering
justice
o'connor's
question,
which
was
about
where
in
the
record
do
we
look
to
find
evidence
that
the
district
court
could
have
based
a
finding
on.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
you
go
with
pages
to
the
record?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
was
after
they
had
lost
the
trial.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
that
is
quite
a
different
context
to
say
then,
sure,
you
are
going
to
do
anything
you
can
to
upset
the
verdict,
but
their
testimony
was
of
this
guy's
opinion
before
the
trial,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
was
testifying
afterwards,
but
he
was
giving
his
point
of
view
before
the
trial.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
yes,
that
is
all
we
are
saying,
is
that
that's
what
he
testified
to.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
testifying
different,
taking
a
different
position
after
you've
lost
the
trial
really
is
not
a
contradiction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
the
setup
in
georgia
by
counties
or
by
circuits?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
every
county
has
its
own
jury?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
is
a
grand
jury,
not
a
petit
jury?
chief
justice
rehnquist
both.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
this
authenticated
in
some
way--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--so
we
know
someone
testified
that
he
did
write
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bright.
ms.
boleyn,
we
will
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
boleyn,
did
the
district
court
issue
any
opinion
on
this
subject
other
than
the
order
and
memorandum
decision
that
is
contained
from
page
90
to
93
of
the
appendix?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
and
that
is
the
one
at
page
90
to
93.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
may
i
interrupt?
is
the
solicitor
also
the
prosecutor?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
solicitor
is
the
prosecutor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
boleyn.
mr.
bright,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bright.
the
case
is
submitted.
