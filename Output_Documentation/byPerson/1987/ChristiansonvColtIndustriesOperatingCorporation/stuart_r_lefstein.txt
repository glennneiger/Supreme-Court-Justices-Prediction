mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
anti-trust
case
and
a
state
law
tortious
interference
with
business
expectancies
case
that
was
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
rock
island,
illinois.
summary
judgment
was
granted
for
the
plaintiffs,
charles
christianson,
and
his
business,
international
trade
service.
the
defendant,
colt,
then
took
an
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
the
federal
circuit,
pursuant
to
the
plaintiffs'
motion,
transferred
the
case
to
the
seventh
circuit
on
the
ground
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
the
seventh
circuit,
after
hearing
arguments
on
the
merits,
briefing
and
oral
arguments,
sua
sponte,
wrote
an
opinion
saying
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
but
that,
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
okay.
i'll
accept
the
correction.
the
case
was
then
sent
back
to
the
federal
circuit.
the
federal
circuit
then
wrote
a
lengthy
opinion,
most
of
which
dealt
with
the
subject
of
jurisdiction.
it
explained
very
carefully
why
it
was
right
the
first
time,
why
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
it
specifically
held,
as
it
said
in
its
first
order,
it
had
no
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
congressional
enactment,
and
then
it
said,
nonetheless,
despite
the
lack
of
a
statutory
grant
of
jurisdiction,
it
was
going
to
decide
the
merits,
and
in
deciding
the
merits,
it
reversed
the
judgment
below
that
was
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and,
of
course,
then
after
that,
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
certiorari
petition
had
actually
submitted
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
the
question
was
phrased
whether
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
may
rule
on
the
merits
of
an
appeal
when
it
expressly
rules
that
it
does
not
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
statute.
that
question
was
granted
and
the
court
directed
the
parties
to
brief
and
argue
a
second
question,
which
it
did,
in
fact,
the
federal
circuit
have
jurisdiction
from
the
appeal.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
question,--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--what
we
are
actually
asking,
the
relief
we're
asking
for
at
this
particular
time
is
that
the
appeal
be
dismissed.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
that's
what
we're
asking
for.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
well,
then,
it
would
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
if
that
was
the
court's
order,
yes.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
well,
the
case--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--well,
we
are
requesting
for
reasons
that
we've
placed
in
our
brief
that
if
we
are
correct
and
that
is
and
if
the
federal
circuit
is
correct,
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
that,
therefore,
the
remedy
is
dismissal,
and
we've
said
that
actually
for
a
couple
of
reasons,
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
colt
did
not
cross
petition
and,
therefore,
they're
not
entitled
under
prior
holdings
of
this
court,
which
we've
cited,
to
obtain
the
remedy
of
transfer
and,
of
course,
the
remedy
of
transfer
pursuant
to
section
1631
may
only
be
granted
if
it
is
in
the
interest
of
justice.
we've
cited
reasons
why
we
believe
it
is
not
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
bring
about
a
transfer,
and
that
is
because
we
believe
that
colt,
in
its
briefing
on
the
jurisdictional
question,
which
was
presented
to
both
courts,
and
even
in
its
brief
to
the
seventh
circuit,
made
statements
in
it
which
we
believe
actually
misled
the
seventh
circuit
into
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
federal
circuit
and
not
the
seventh
circuit
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
to
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
well,
you
might
remand
it
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
i
assume
that
you
would
then
have
to
give
directions
as
to
what
would
have
to
be
done.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
well,
that's
obviously
one
of
the
options
that
this
court
could
exercise.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
well,
wait
a
minute.
i
want
to
back
off
that
answer
for
just
a
second.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
it
was
argued
on
the
merits.
it
was
briefed
on
the
merits.
an
oral
argument
was
presented
on
the
merits.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
decide
the
merits.
they
didn't
reach
the
question.
they
said
we
don't
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
the...
it
was
our
opponent,
colt,
the
defendant,
who
had
a
summary
judgment
entered
against
it
by
the
district
judge,
who
took
the
appeal
initially
to
the
federal
circuit,
and
then
the
plaintiff,
charles
christianson,
moved
to
transfer
the
case
to
the
seventh
circuit
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
circuit
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
and
at
that
point,
the
federal
circuit,
after
receiving
briefs
on
that
question,
and
presumably
considering
the
whole
issue,
entered
an
order
which
specifically
said
that
we
don't...
i
think
the
language
was
probably
a
three-line
order,
which
said
we
see
no
basis
for
any
jurisdiction
in
our
court,
and
accordingly,
and
i'm
paraphrasing
now,
we
transfer
the
case
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
well,
that's
obviously
one
of
the
questions.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
that's
obviously
one
option,
but--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--well,
if
that's
your
answer,
that's
one
of
the
approaches
that
you
could
take.
i
might
just
mention
that
we
have
presented...
the
first
question
actually
states
"may
a
court
rule
on
the
merits
after
it
expressly
states
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
"
and
i
suppose,
technically,
if
you
answer
that
question
in
the
negative,
and
if
you
viewed
that
question
as
dispositive,
then
i
think
you
could
actually
say
that
the
federal
circuit
should
not
have
decided
it
also.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
and
if
you
view
that
one
as
dispositive--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--okay.
it
you
agree--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--well,
there
was
a
question--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--at
the
present
time,
there
is
not
such
a
question.
in
our
prayer
for
relief
at
the
conclusion
of
our
briefs,
we
have
suggested
that
if
the
court
should
decide
that
the
federal
circuit
was
wrong
in
saying
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
and,
in
fact,
had
jurisdiction,
we
have
renewed
our
request
that
you
accept
certiorari
on
the
merits.
i
realize
that's
strictly
up
to
this
court.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
no,
that's
incorrect.
the
federal
circuit
gave
an
opinion
on
the
merits.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
that
is
one
of
the
options.
i've
always
assumed
this
court
in
exercising--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--well,
the
statutory
power
is
under
section
1631,
which
indicates
a
transfer
if
it
is
in
the
interests
of
justice,
and,
so,
we've
made
some
arguments
concerning
the
matter
of
whether
it
is
in
the
interest
of
justice.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
our
preference
is
that
you
dismiss
the
appeal.
that
you
send
it
back
to
the
federal
circuit
with
directions
that
the
appeal
be
dismissed.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
if
you
agree
with
us
that
it's
not
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
retransfer
it,--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
that's
correct,
and
i
think
that
that's
a
highly
significant
point,
and
because
what
colt
is
really
seeking
is
a
form
of
remedy
which
is
a
transfer
back
to
the
seventh
circuit
which
could
get
colt
more
or
less
relief
than
what
they
received
from
the
federal
circuit.
they
could
get
more
relief
because
they
also
had
a
claim
for
a
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
federal
circuit
did
not
give
them
that
relief,
but,
arguably,
the
seventh
circuit
could,
so
a
transfer
could
get
them
more
relief
than,
of
course,
under
one
of
the
cases
we
cite,
i
think
the
federal
energy
case.
even
if
there's
going
to
be
a
modification
which
would
give
less
relief,
there's
a
duty
to
cross
petition.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
i
certainly
will.
the
court
that
we
say
had
jurisdiction
is
the
federal
circuit,
and...
i'm
sorry.
is
the
seventh
circuit,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
we're
dealing
with
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine.
we're
dealing
with
the
traditional
concepts
of
arising
under
jurisdiction.
the
seventh
circuit
had
jurisdiction
it
the
federal
circuit
did
not.
the
federal
circuit
only
has
jurisdiction
of
those
cases
that
1338>
["].
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
oh,
yes.
yes.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
i
think
under
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine,
the
seventh
circuit
would
still
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
even
if,
arguably,
you
look
at
subsequent
amendments,
i
think
you
still
have
to,
under
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine,
and
i
think
this
is
explained
very
careful
in
the
franchise
tax
board
case,
you're
still
dealing
with
what
is
the
plaintiff's
cause
of
action.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
okay.
and
the
simple
reason
for
this
is
that
when
congress
set
up
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
circuit,
congress
didn't
create
some
new
standard
for
the
federal
circuit.
what
congress
said
was
the
federal
circuit's
appellate
jurisdiction
is
going
to
hinge
precisely
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
so,
your
question
seemingly
assumes
that
there's
different
standard
under
section
1295
which
relates
to
the
federal
circuit,
but
1295
jurisdiction
hinges
on
whether
there
was
a
rise
in
under-jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
and
if--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--that's
a
good
answer.
i
think
congress
has
spoken
on
this,
and
if
you
read
the
reports
which
have
been
cited,
and
i
might
say,
with
all
the
disagreements
that
colt
and
christianson
have
in
this
case,
right
in
their
brief,
they
agree
right
at
the
outset
that
what
we're
dealing
with
are
the
traditional
concepts
of
arising
under
jurisdiction
and
they
cite
the
same
congressional
report
that
we
cite,
and
that
congress
specifically
rejected
some
form
of
issue
jurisdiction
for
the
federal
circuit
as
opposed
to
case
jurisdiction
because
case
jurisdiction
is
the
standard
under
the
arising
understanding.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
i
think
the
concepts
of
arising
under,
although
we
have
a
hundred
years
of
history
with
respect
to
those
concepts,
nonetheless,
i
think
they
are
tests
which
probably
any
court
is
competent
or
should
be
competent
to
decide.
i
might
say
this,
this
issue
arose
for
the
first
time
in
the
federal
circuit.
it
didn't
arise
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
what
we
have
is
a
situation
where
the
seventh
circuit
clearly
has
jurisdiction
if
the
federal
circuit
did
not,
and,
therefore,
what
we
were
really
dealing
with
was
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
circuit,
even
though
it
impacts
on
the
seventh
circuit.
and
it
simply
seems
to
us
that
the
federal
circuit
having
examined
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
and
having
heard
briefs
on
the
matter
and
having
entered
an
order
that
that
order
should
have
been
given
respect
by
the
seventh
circuit.
in
fact,
there's
an
argument
in
both
briefs
on
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
well,
that's
certainly
so,
but
i've
read
several
opinions
where
this
court
has
said
that
they
decide
matters
on
narrow
grounds,
but
if
the
court
is
going
to
fashion
a
decision
which
is
going
to
address
the
matter
of
which
court,
in
fact,
had
jurisdiction,
then
obviously
you
couldn't
go
on
some
type
of
law
of
the
case
argument.
but
what
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
i
suppose,
and
i
think
justice
stevens
just
a
few
minutes
ago
asked
me
to
explain
why
the
federal
circuit
did
not
have
jurisdiction
and
the
seventh
circuit
did,
simply
is
that
we
had
an
anti-trust
complaint.
we
made
no
allegation,
except
there
was
one
reference
in
one
paragraph
that
even
mentioned
this
patent
issue,
this
so-called
112
issue,
and
that
paragraph
didn't
say,
didn't
make
any
claim
at
all
that
there
were
invalid
patents.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
well,
the
case
on--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--well,
but,
of
course,
using
that
analysis
would
contravene
all
of
the
years
of
teaching
on
this
subject
and
as
it
culminated
in
franchise
tax
board,
which
is
that
we
look
at
the
complaint,
and
the
posture
in
which
that
issue
arose--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--well,
if
that
was
the
case,
then
we
could
have
had
that
resolved
in
franchise
tax
board
because
the
clear
holding
in
the
language
of
franchise
tax
board
is
that
even
where
the
only
issue
truly
at
issue
in
the
case
is
the
matter
that's
decided,
if
that
didn't
arise
in
the
complaint,
if
that
was
a
defense,
then
we
don't
have
jurisdiction,
and
what
we
had
here
was
an
anti-trust--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--i
understand.
i
can
only
answer
that
by
saying
that
congress
has
spoken
in
this
particular
area.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
i
think
they
did,
and
what
i
base
that
on--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--there
is
a
statement
and
it's
cited
in
both
briefs,
and
we
didn't
tag
on
one
further
statement
to
it,
but
the
statement
in
the
congressional
reports...
i
think...
i'm
not
sure
if
it's
the
senate
or
the
house,
it
states
that
the
test
of
appellate
jurisdiction
depends
on
district
court
jurisdiction
and
that
there
is
arising
under
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
in
the
same
sense
that
there
is
arising
under,
and
i'm
paraphrasing
now,
that
there
is
arising
under
jurisdiction
with
federal
question
jurisdiction.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
i
don't
recall
anything
directed
to
that,
and
i
might
add
that
with
the
statement
i
just
paraphrased
from
the
congressional
record,
they
then
state
contrast
coastal
states
which
was
a
case
of
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals,
which
went
off
on
issue
jurisdiction.
so,
the
congressional
record
was
clearly
saying
we're
not
going
to
do
that
here.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
i
hesitate
to
speak
for
them
all.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
i
can't
speak
to
that.
i
assume
congress
has
some
lawyers.
maybe
they
understand
it,
maybe
they
don't.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
i'm
sorry?
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
yes,
yes.
well,
actually,--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--i
obviously
can't
speak
to
that.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
it
depends
what
the
experience
of
the
lawyers
were,
who
were
on
these
committees.
if
they
had
occasion
to
go
into
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine.
i
think,
though,
on
that
statute,
what
i
should
emphasize
is
they
didn't
enact
a
new
district
court
jurisdictional
statute.
they
let
section
1338
just
as
it
was,
and
they
said,
we're
going
to
peg
the
appellate
jurisdiction
to
what
the
jurisdiction...
to
what
1338
says.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
well,
i
think
it
does
makes
sense,
even
if
we
want
to
ignore
what
congress
seemingly
said,
and
even
if
we
want
to
look
at
mere
policy
because
what
we
have
is
a
situation
where
congress
also
said
we
want
to
avoid
undue
specialization.
there
is
discussion
of
that
in
the
congressional
reports.
that
we
don't
want
one
court
that's
just
going
to
be
deciding
one
particular
thing,
and
i
might
also
point
out
that
in
this
particular
area,
what
we're
doing
here
with
the
112
issue
as
it
arose
in
this
case,
it
is
a
federal
pre-emption
question,
and
the
irony
of
the
case
is
that
the
federal
circuit
has
specifically
said,
and
we
cite
the
case,
cable
electric,
that
federal
pre-emption
questions,
which
this
section
112
issue
is,
we
do
not
believe
that
we
have
a
mandate
from
congress
to
unify
the
law
on
questions
of
federal
pre-emption,
and
that
we're
going
to
follow
the
law
of
the
regional
circuit.
so
that
had
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
actually
come
out
with
a
different
result
on
the
merits,
they
would
have
looked
to
seventh
circuit
law
to
the
extent
that
they
could
have
divined
it
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
federal
pre-emption
under
the
patent
laws
and,
of
course,
this
particular
case
is
going
to
mean
that
if
the
result
was
different
because
of
the
exclusivity
provision
in
section
1338,
which
means
that
the
states
must
hear...
where
the
states
now
have
a
right
to
hear
cases
involving
patent
issues,
but
not
patent
cases,
that
any
decision
in
a
case
such
as
this,
and
the
federal
circuit
gave
an
example,
if
there
was
a
state
law
anti-trust
case
brought,
that
that
would
mean
even
though
they've
heard
these
cases
for
a
hundred
years
because
of
that
exclusivity
provision,
they
would
have
to
come
out
of
the
state
courts
and
into
the
federal
courts.
so,
i
think
an
answer
to
the
question
that
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
arising
under
concept
makes
sense
because
i
don't
think
it's
beneficial
to
bring
all
of
the
traditional
cases
that
the
states
have
held
and
bring
them
into
the
federal
courts.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
right.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
no.
i
think
that
has
to
do
with
specific
claims.
in
other
words,
we've
got
one
anti-trust
count.
in
other
words,
the
in
whole
or
in
part
language
is
not
in
section
1338.
the
in
whole
or
in
part
language
is
in
section
1295.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
so
that
you
still
have
to
have
a
genuine
arising
under
case
in
your
complaint,
and
i
think
we
touch
that
in
our
reply
brief,
but,
basically,
we
have
a
situation
where
we
have
solely
an
anti-trust
case.
so,
there's
no
count
at
all
that's
based
on
the
patent
laws.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
we
think
they
should
have
dismissed
it
and
then
colt
could
have
sought
certiorari
or
they
could
have
sought
mandamus
against
one
or
both
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
no.
i
think
that
would
have
been
unseemingly.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
i
think
they
could
have
certified
it.
i
think
that
would
have
been
appropriate.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
mr.
chief
justice,
u.s.
v.
hohri,
which
was
just
cited
by
mr.
radice,
is
a
case
where
there
was
a
transfer,
but
there
was
a
cross
petition.
both
parties
petitioned
in
that
particular
case,
and
there
was
no
discussion
of
the
interest
of
justice
question.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
yes.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
well,
because
the
arising
under
doctrine
simply
has
to
do
with
our--
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
--okay.
let
me
say
this
first.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
no.
okay.
i
think
what's
significant
here,
we
don't
agree
at
all
that
this
complaint
was
ever
amended.
we
don't
agree
that
anything
ever
changed,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
stress
that
the
complaint
was
understood
by
mr.
radice
and
colt
to
the
effect
when
he
admitted
patent
validity
and
he
did
nothing,
there's
nothing
in
their
answer
that
raised
a
112
issue.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
well,
i
think
that
they
were
looking
at
what
happened
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
mr.
stuart
r.
lefstein
well,
there's
nothing
different
about
our
theory
than
every
case.
i
mean,
if
you're
going
to
say
that
in
our
case,
you
could
have
said
that
in
franchise
tax
board,
and,
of
course,
what
happened
here
in
our
particular
case
was
that
the
section
112
issue
was
in
the
pleadings.
it
was
in
our
reply
to
colt's
counter
claims.
so,
this
whole
business
about
section
15(b)...
by
the
way,
section
15(b)
doesn't
say
that
the
complaint
is
amended,
it
said
that
the
pleadings
can
be
so,
and
what
we
have
in
this
particular
situation,
we
had
the
112
issue,
but
it
came
up
way
down
stream
from
the
complaint.
so
that
we
really
had
no
patent
issue
in
this
case
until
colt
in
its
answer
said
we're
justifying
our
anti-competitive
conduct
with
a
claim
of
state
law
protected
trade
secrets,
and
then,
in
an
argument
and
in
a
reply
to
that
claim
of
state
law
trade
secrets,
we
injected
the
patent
pre-emption
issue
for
the
first
time,
and
that's
the
way
it
stayed
through
the
end
of
this
lawsuit.
