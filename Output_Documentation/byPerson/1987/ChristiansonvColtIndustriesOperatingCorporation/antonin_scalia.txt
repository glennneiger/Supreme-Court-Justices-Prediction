justice
scalia
you
do
not
question
that
if
we
decide
that
the
federal
circuit
did
riot
have
jurisdiction,
an
available
form
of
relief
would
be
for
us
to
simply
send
the
case
back
to
the
seventh
circuit?
could
we
do
that?
justice
scalia
could
do
any
type...
oh,
i
see.
we
like
to
think
there's
some
statutory
policy.
right.
justice
scalia
this
is
all
very
fanciful,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
they
wrote
something
that
reads
very
much
like
1331,
though,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
they
wrote
something
that
reads
very
much
like
the
provision
of
the
statute
that
uses
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine.
that's
what
they
enacted,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
you
don't
know
if
they
understood
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine?
justice
scalia
you
think...
you
want
to
make
a
guess
about
it?
justice
scalia
it
wasn't
your
position,
though,
when
you
got
the
complaint
because,
in
fact,
your
answer
to
the
complaint
indicated
that
you
didn't
think
there
was
a
patent
issue.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
what...
i
mean,
there
you
are.
you
say
you
admitted
that
colt
patents
are
valid
until
the
end
of
each
of
their
respective
lifetimes.
you
regarded
the
complaint
as
not
raising
a
patent
issue.
justice
scalia
denying
what?
the
allegation
generally,
but
when
you
come
to
talk
specifically
about
patents,
you
admit
that
the
patents
are
valid.
in
other
words,
you're
saying
there's
no
patent
issue
in
this
case.
that's
what
your
answer
says.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
the
end
of
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine
then,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
we
could
call
it
the
well-tried
case
doctrine
because
whatever
comes
out
automatically
is
considered
to
amend
the
complaint
and
whatever
the
case
shows
is
determined
by
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
scalia
under
1331?
justice
scalia
do
you
have
any...
i
mean,
looking
to
other
litigation
is
really
just
trying
to
find
out
what
the
complaint
historically
meant.
you
can
perhaps
give
it
some
clarity
by
looking
at
other
litigation
that
was
there
at
the
same
time,
but
that's
quite
different
from
saying
we're
going
to
look
at
the
way
the
case
developed.
the
way
the
case
develops
does
not
necessarily
have
anything
to
do
with
what
the
complaint
meant.
it
seems
to
me
the
best
indication
if
you're
going
to
look
outside
its
face
what
the
complaint
meant
is
what
kind
of
an
answer
did
it
provoke
from
the
defendant.
and
here
you
admit
that
there's
no
patent
issue.
justice
scalia
yes.
you
are
relying
on
the
fact
that
a
case
can
change
while
it's
being
tried.
justice
scalia
so,
you
don't
think
that
whether
there's
federal
jurisdiction
or
not
is
fixed
when
the
complaint
is
filed.
so,
you're
not
looking
for
historical
fact
what
the
complaint
meant.
justice
scalia
mr.
radice,
could
i
ask
about...
i
don't
understand
how
you
expect
your
rule
15(b)
argument
to
work
when
the
proof
shows
that
there
is
a
patent
claim
the
complaint
is
deemed
amended
to
conform
to
that
proof.
let's
assume
i'm
sitting
on
the
seventh
circuit
and
half
way...
i
think
i
have
jurisdiction
because
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
there's
any
patent
limit
and
deep
into
the
trial,
it
appears
that
we're
getting
into
a
patent
issue
and,
boy,
this
case
is
really
going
to
boil
down,
what
do
i
do
then.
i
transfer
to
the
federal
circuit.
justice
scalia
and
it
doesn't
arise
at
the
district
court
level?
why
doesn't
it
arise
at
the
district
court
level
insofar
as
the--
justice
scalia
--you
say
there's
a
constantly
shifting
jurisdictional
basis
in
the
district
court,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
scalia
doesn't
the
district
court
have
to
know
what
law
it's
going
to
be
governed
by?
let's
assume
the
federal
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
have
quite
different
resolutions
of
a
particular
issue.
as
the
trial
proceeds,
the
district
judge
says,
oh,
i'm
back
to
the
federal
circuit
now,
and
then
the
evidence
changes,
whoops,
i'm
back
at
the
seventh
circuit.
this
goes
back
and
forth
during
the
whole
trial.
justice
scalia
would
apply
anyway.
so,
it
wouldn't
matter.
justice
scalia
well,
even
if
you
say
that
you
can
use
it
as
a
practical
matter
in
this
area,
you
certainly
couldn't
apply
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine
generally
as
far
as
federal
versus
state
jurisdiction
goes
in
that
fashion,
could
you,
because
then
a
federal
court
would
not
know
during
the
course
of
a
trial
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
or
not?
so,
you're
arguing
for
a
different
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
here--
justice
scalia
--well,
let's
leave
patent
claims
out
of
it.
the
issue
is
just
whether
this
is
a
federal
case
or
not
before
a
federal
district
court.
no
patent
issue.
just
another
federal
issue
and
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
sometimes
it
seems
there
is
and
sometimes
it
seems
there
isn't.
you're
saying
that
you
can
look
to
the
end
of
the
trial
to
determine
whether
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction.
justice
scalia
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
does
not
apply
to
appellate
jurisdictions.
it
applies
to
district
court
jurisdiction
as
well,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
and
you're
asserting
that
the
principle
you're
now
espousing
is
what
is
used
in
determining
whether
a
federal
court
has
jurisdiction,
that
you
look
at
how
the
trial
goes,
and
if
the
decision
is
ultimately
based
on
a
federal
question,
it
had
jurisdiction,
and
if
it
isn't,
it
didn't.
is
that
really--
justice
scalia
--i'm
talking
generally
and
never
mind
the
changing.
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
it
appears
that
there
was
a
federal
claim
because
of
new
evidence
brought
in,
although
the
complaint
clearly
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
there
wasn't
any.
you're
saying
that
there
would
be
federal
jurisdiction
under
standard
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine.
justice
scalia
do
you
have
any
cases,
aside
from
this
patent
area?
justice
scalia
any
case
at
all
that
does--
justice
scalia
--you
have
cases
that
you
think
the
case
would
say
that?
