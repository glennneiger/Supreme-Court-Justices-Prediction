justice
jr.
yes,
but
the
only
question
for
us
to
decide,
i
gather,
is
which
of
the
courts
was
the
proper
court
for
which
the
appeal
should
have
been
taken.
justice
jr.
but
if
we
were
to
decide
that,
then
can't
we
send
back
the
merits
to
whichever
court
we
think
should
have
had
the
appeal?
justice
jr.
there
is
no
question
presented
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
decision
on
merits.
justice
jr.
i
agree
with
you
that
the
federal
circuit
has
jurisdiction.
what
about
the
decision
on
the
merits?
do
you
concede
have
reason
to
seek
cert
here
for
review
of
the
merits?
justice
jr.
yes,
but
we
have
not
had
any
appellate
review
of
that
decision,
have
we?
justice
william

brennan,
jr.
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce,
christianson
versus
colt
industries
operating
corperation
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
it
requires
that
we
decide
whether
that
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
decide
an
appeal
from
a
final
decision
of
a
federal
district
court
in
favor
of
petitioners
in
a
suit
pleading
an
antitrust
action
against
respondent,
and
also,
a
second
cause
of
action
under
state
law
for
tortious
interference
with
business
relationships.
a
statute
vests
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
such
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
if
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
was
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
another
statute
which
grants
the
district
court
original
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
and
“arising
under,”
any
federal
statute
relating
to
patents.
petitioner
obtained
a
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
a
motion
that
raised
a
patent
or
issue
and
respondent
appealed
to
the
federal
circuit.
that
court
concluded
that
it
lack
jurisdiction
and
transferred
the
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
seventh
circuit
however,
held
that
the
federal
circuit
was
clearly
wrong
in
disclaiming
jurisdiction
and
transferred
the
appeal
back
to
the
federal
circuit.
the
federal
circuit,
for
its
part,
adhered
to
its
prior
jurisdictional
ruling,
concluding
that
the
seventh
circuit
exhibited,
and
i
quote,
“a
monumental
misunderstanding
of
the
patent
jurisdiction
granted
this
court”
and
was
“clearly
wrong.”
nevertheless,
the
federal
circuit
proceeded
to
address
the
merits
in
the
interest
of
justice
and
reversed
the
district
court.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
federal
circuit.
we
hold
that
the
suite
brought
by
petitioners
against
the
respondent
is
not
an
action
arising
under
the
patent
statutes
for
purposes
of
section
1338(a)
are
reasons
for
reaching
this
conclusion
that
set
forth
at
length
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk.
we
hold
further
that
the
federal
circuit
after
concluding
that
it
lack
jurisdiction
erred
in
deciding
to
reach
the
merits
anyway
in
the
interest
of
justice.
courts
created
by
statute
only
have
such
jurisdiction
as
the
statute
confers.
upon
concluding
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction,
the
federal
circuit
had
authority,
under
section
1631,
to
make
a
single
decision,
either
to
dismiss
the
case
or
to
transfer
it
to
a
court
of
appeals
that
had
jurisdiction.
the
rule
that
a
court
may
not
in
any
case,
even
in
the
interest
of
justice,
extend
its
jurisdiction
where
none
exists
on
occasions
worked
injustice
in
particular
cases
especially
in
the
situation
where,
as
here,
the
litigants
are
bandied
back
and
forth
between
two
courts,
each
of
which
insists
that
the
other
has
jurisdiction.
such
situations
in
here
and
the
very
nature
of
jurisdictional
lines,
for
few
jurisdictional
lines
can
be
so
finely
drawn
as
to
leave
no
room
for
disagreement
on
close
cases.
however,
the
courts
of
appeals
should
achieve
the
end
of
quick
settlement
of
questions
of
transfer
by
adhering
we
suggest,
strictly
the
principles
of
law
of
the
case.
while
adherence
to
that
principle
will
not
shield
an
incorrect
jurisdictional
decision,
should
this
court
choose
to
grant
review,
it
will
obviate
the
necessity
for
us
to
resolve
every
marginal
jurisdictional
dispute.
the
opinion
is
unanimous
and
justice
stevens,
joined
by
justice
blackmun,
while
joining
the
opinion
with
the
court,
has
filed
a
separate
concurrence.
