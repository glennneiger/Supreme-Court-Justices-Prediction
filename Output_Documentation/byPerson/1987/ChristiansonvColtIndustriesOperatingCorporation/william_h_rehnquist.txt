chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
wait
just
a
moment,
mr.
lefstein,
till
the
court
clears.
0....
very
well.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
mean
the
opinion
was
written
sua
sponte
or
the
holding
was
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
sua
sponte?
courts
write
opinions
sua
sponte.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
your
motives
and
ours
may
be
somewhat
different.
i
think
probably
this
court's
interest
is
to
see
which
of
the
two
courts
of
appeals
was
correct
as
to
where
this
appeal
should
have
gone
to,
and
your
motive
is
obviously
to
obtain
a
victory
for
your
client,
just
like
any
good
lawyer.
but
your
appeal
has...
it
was
not
heard
on
the
merits
in
the
seventh
circuit,
was
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
was
it
heard
on
the
merits...
it
was
heard
on
the
merits--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--okay.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
it
was
your
client...
well,
no.
it
was
your
opponent
who
took
the
appeal...
was
it
you
or
your
opponent
that
took
the
appeal
originally
from
the
rock
island
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
has
never
been
an
appellate
opinion
on
the
merits
in
this
case,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
we
went
off
on
that
ground,
we
would
settle
nothing
except
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lefstein.
mr.
radice,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
the
district
court
judgment
defines
the
well-pleaded
complaint?
chief
justice
rehnquist
1338,
i
think
as
your
opponent
points
out,
it
talks
about
having
original
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
arising
under
any
act
of
congress
relating
to
patents.
now,
you
say
you
can
simply
rely
on
the
judgment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
ordinarily
you
think
of
1338
as
a
grant
of
jurisdiction,
and
that
people
should
know
when
the
complaint
is
filed
whether
the
court
has
jurisdiction
or
not.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
if
you
take
your
view,
you
would
never
know
whether
a
case
was
one
arising
under
an
act
of
congress
until
you
saw
the
judgment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
lots
of
times,
the
theory
of
a
case
changes
entirely
from
the
time
a
complaint
is
filed,
and
this
may
have
been
one
of
them,
till
the
time
judgment
is
entered.
so,
you
really
got
to
address
yourself
as
to
what
point
in
the
litigation
does
the
arising
under
business
apply.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
must
establish
both
that
the...
if
you're
supporting
this
particular
judgement
before
us
now,
you
have
to
say
that
the
federal
circuit
did
not
have
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal
in
the
first
place,
but
it
was
justified
in
going
on
to
decide
the
case
under
the
interest
of
justice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
the
seventh
circuit
was
right
on
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
federal
circuit
was
wrong,
but
since
the
federal
circuit
decided
it
and
since
you
feel
it
had
jurisdiction,
then
you
support
the
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
radice.
mr.
lefstein,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lefstein.
the
case
is
submitted.
