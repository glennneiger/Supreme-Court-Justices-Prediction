justice
kennedy
in
other
words,
you
don't
want
us
to
let
the
seventh
circuit
hear
the
merits
if
the
federal
circuit
had
no
jurisdiction?
justice
kennedy
and
the
reason
you
say
it's
not
in
the
interest
of
justice
is
because
colt
made
some
misleading
statements
in
characterizing
your
complaint?
justice
kennedy
but
this
was
the
same
complaint
that
two
circuits
was
inartfully
drafted?
justice
kennedy
counsel,
what
should
the
federal
circuit
have
done
here
in
your
view
when
it
gets
this
case
back
a
second
time?
justice
kennedy
not
sent
it
back
to
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
kennedy
not
certified?
justice
kennedy
what
was
the
ultimate
relief
granted
by
the
district
court?
it
wasn't
just
to
invalidate
the
patents,
was
it?
justice
kennedy
and
wasn't
that
just
a
threshold
step
toward
assessing
liability
under
boycott
and
anti-trust
theory?
justice
kennedy
but
the
relief--
justice
kennedy
--but
the
ultimate
relief
the
plaintiff
was
seeking
and
that
the
district
court
was
driving
toward
was
damages
under
the
anti-trust
law
and
boycott
theories,
was
it
not?
justice
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
this
case
could
not
have
been
brought
in
state
court
under
a
state
anti-trust
law?
justice
kennedy
i
don't
know
illinois
law,
but
suppose
under
new
york,
the
little-sherman
act,
could
this
be
brought
in
state
court?
same
complaint?
justice
kennedy
no
jurisdiction
in
the
state
court
from
the
outset?
justice
kennedy
that's
your
position?
justice
kennedy
the
federal
circuit
has
not
granted
jurisdiction
in
any
such
case
or
has
it?
justice
kennedy
and,
in
fact,
the
other
circuits
have
retained
jurisdiction
in
themselves,
have
they
not?
