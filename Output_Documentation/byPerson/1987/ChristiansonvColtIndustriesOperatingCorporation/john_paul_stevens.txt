justice
stevens
well,
you
also
make
a
point
they
didn't
cross
petition.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
though?
there
a
lot
of
things
that
can
be
done
here,
but
would
you
tell
me
which
court
you
think
had
jurisdiction
and
why?
justice
stevens
let
me
ask.
you
basically
agree
with
judge
markey's
discussion
on
the
jurisdiction
issue,
i
gather?
justice
stevens
what
would
you
say
if
half
way
through
the
trial,
you
had
filed
an
amended
complaint
which
clearly
was
predicated
on
the
patent
laws
and
the
section
that
they
construed
in
this
case,
would
there...
which
court
would
have
jurisdiction
then?
not
the
original
complaint,
but
you
amended
your
complaint.
didn't
wait
to
conform
to
the
rules,
but...
and
then,
from
then
on,
that's
all
the
court
did,
was
resolve
the
issues
raised
by
your
amended
complaint,
who
would
have
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
you
look
at
the
original
complaint
and
you
don't
even
look
at
any
substantive
amendments?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
those
cases
really
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
the
trial
court
had
federal
jurisdiction.
here,
the
question
is
whether
an
appellate
court
has
jurisdiction,
and
why
does
it
make
a
lot
more
sense
to
say
at
the
time
of
the
appeal,
let's
see
what
was
decided
in
the
trial
court
and
what
is
a
fair
constructive
complaint
at
that
time.
justice
stevens
so
that
your
answer
is
basically
that
even
thought
it
might
make
a
lot
of
sense,
that's
not
what
the
statute
does.
justice
stevens
mr.
lefstein,
suppose
there
are
cases
in
which
there
is
a
tradition
of
construing
federal
jurisdiction
narrowly,
as
the
federal
courts
are
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction,
but
here
congress
was
concerned
about
creating
a
specialized
tribunal
who
would
decide
patent
issues
because
there
was
expertise
there
that
wasn't
share
by
the
courts
around
the
country.
so,
is
it
really
compulsory
that
we
follow
the
same
strict
analysis
that
would
apply
in
the
federal
jurisdiction
cases
in
a
case
like
this?
i
think
we're
talking
about
appellate
jurisdiction,
too.
justice
stevens
you
think
they
considered
this
problem
of
amended
complaints
and
maybe
a
case
does
change
its
posture
as
it
develops
in
the
trial?
justice
stevens
what's
the
most
illuminating
discussion
of
this
particular
aspect
of
it
that
you
can
point
me
to?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
that's
right.
that's
in
the
legislative
history,
but
i'm
asking
you
is
there
any
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
that
you're
aware
of
of
the
problem
of
a
case
during
the
process
of
trial
changing
its
character
somewhat
from
what
it
looked
like
on
the
complaint
to
what
it
looks
like
after
you
get
into
the
evidence
and
perhaps
amend
the
pleadings
and
that.
i
don't
think
that's
even
discussed
in
the
history.
justice
stevens
mr.
lefstein,
you
think
the
majority
of
members
in
congress
and
the
president
understood
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question?
the
language
of
1295(a)(1)
is
that
there's
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
circuit
if
the
claim
was
one
that
arose
in
whole
or
in
part
under
1338.
justice
stevens
does
that
mean
that
if
there's
a
single
allegation
in
your
complaint,
and
i
know
you
deny
that
there
is,
but
under
the
patent,
that
that
would
be
enough
to...
that
would
be...
satisfy
in
part
and,
therefore,
there
would
be
a
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
correct.
justice
stevens
you
want
us
to
say
the
reasons
given
by
the
seventh
circuit
are
correct,
but
the
judgment
entered
by
the
federal
circuit
was
correct.
justice
stevens
you
have
suggested
the
case,
and
i'm
curious
and
i
don't
know
if
this
is
the
law,
but
in
your
brief,
you
cite
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
patent
claim
asserted
in
the
complaint,
and
then,
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
patent
theory
was
abandoned,
and
the
federal
circuit
held
in
that
case
that
it
would
look
at
the
later...
would
not
look
at
the
original
complaint
and
they
declined
jurisdiction.
is
that
the
general
rule
that's
accepted,
that
they
will...
when
it
will
deprive
them
of
jurisdiction
to
look
at
later
amendments,
they
will
not
just
look
at
the
well-pleaded
complaint,
they
will
look
at
the
latest.
justice
stevens
your
opponent
didn't
discuss
those
cases,
as
i
read
the
brief.
justice
stevens
what
was
the...
the
atari
case,
which
was
heard
en
banc,
was
one
that
also
looked
at
subsequent
developments,
was
it
not?
justice
stevens
but
in
that
case,
at
least
you
quote
something
your
brief,
that
says
they
looked
at
the
situation
at
the
time
of
the
appeal
rather
than
the
time
of
the
complaint,
which
is
also
consistent
with
your
view
that
you
start
out
with
a
complaint
alleging
a
patent
violation
and
then
later
amend
it
to
abandon
it,
they
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction.
justice
stevens
mr.
lefstein,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
about
the
basic
issue
we're
most
interested
in
rather
than
what
we
do
with
the
case.
do
you
think
that
the
federal
circuit
was
correct
in
the
case
in
which
it
held
that
when
there
is
in
the
complaint
itself
a
clear
patent
claim,
but
then,
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
that
claim
is
dismissed,
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
of
that
appeal?
justice
stevens
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
arising
under
doctrine?
justice
stevens
is
that
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed
it
clearly
did
arise
under
the
patent
laws.
justice
stevens
because
you
don't
discuss
that
case
in
your
reply
brief,
i
don't
think.
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
interested
in
your
answer
to
the
theoretical
problem.
if
you
have
a
complaint
which
clearly
does
make
a
patent
claim,
then
in
the
course
of
the
trial
it's
dismissed,
so
there
are
no
patent
claims
in
it,
for
determining
appellate
jurisdiction,
do
you
look
at
what
happened
after
the
dismissal
or
at
the
time
the
original
complaint
was
filed?
justice
stevens
but
they
dismissed
the
appeal.
they
would
not
take
the
appeal
in
that
case.
i
don't
understand
how
you
reconcile
your
theory
with
the
gronholz
and
schwarzkopf
cases
that
they
cite
in
their
brief.
