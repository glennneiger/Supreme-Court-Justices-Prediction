mr.
anthony
m.
radice
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
is
whether
the
appeal
of
a
judgment
which
invalidates
nine
patents,
disgorges
trade
secrets,
and
imposes
other
liability
as
a
remedy
for
patent
law
violations
belongs
in
the
federal
circuit,
court
of
appeals,
or
a
regional
circuit.
in
short,
is
this
a
case
that
arises
under
the
patent
laws?
the
district
court's
decision
and
judgment
on
liability
held
colt
liable
for
patent
violations,
specifically
that
it
failed
to
comply
with
section
112
of
the
patent
act
in
failing
to
disclose
all
of
the
m-16's
manufacturing
specifications
in
connection
with
certain...
i'm
sorry?
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
it
reached
those
issues
because
those
are
the
issues
presented
to
the
district
court
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
by
the
plaintiff,
by
christianson.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
in
the
summary
judgment
motion,
the
argument
was
made
that--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--in
the
answer
to
the
complaint,
we
did
allege
patent
invalidity
in
response
to
paragraph
18.
in
paragraph
18
of
the
complaint,
which
is
the
critical
one
as
both
the
seventh
and
federal
circuits
have
recognized,
is
not
well
drafted
it's
confusing,
and
essentially
colt
appears
to
allege
patent
validity
and
the
patent
invalidity.
we
responded
with
a
denial
and
then
a
specific
allegation
of
patent
invalidity,
but
we
understood
the
complaint
at
that
time,
your
honor,
to
be
alleging
patent
invalidity
and
trade
secret
invalidity
based
on
112,
and
we
understood
it
that
way
because
this
was
not
the
first
time
we
had
seen
that
theory.
the
action
began
when--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--i
believe
our
adversaries
have
announced
a
desire
to
make
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
at
a
conference
at
which
we
discussed
the
scheduling
of
a
trial,
and,
so,--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--there
had
been
conferences.
not
a
conference
where
the
issues
were
outlined
or
where
there
was
a
pre-trial
order,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
it's
certainly
a
notation
in
the
docket
of
the
conference,
but
i'm
not
sure
whether
there
was
a
transcript
made.
certainly
not
a
pre-trial
order
outlining
the
issues.
the
district
court
on
the
summary
judgment
motion
held
colt
liable
for
violating
the
patent
laws
and
the
relief
or
the
remedy
was
the
declaration
of
invalidity
of
nine
patents
and
all
of
the
trade
secrets.
there
were
no
independent
anti-trust
findings
by
the
district
court
or
any
trust
questions
analyzing
it.
the
district
court
decision
thus
contains
the
actual
basis
of
liability
imposed
and
defines
the
well-pleaded
complaint.
whether
or
not
the
allegations
are
well
expressed
in
the
complaint,
we
say,
the
district
court--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--in
setting
forth
the
elements
of
liability
that
were
imposed,
your
honor,
particularly
important
here
because
the
complaint
was
so
incomplete
and
poorly
drafted.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
we
are
saying
that...
two
things,
your
honor.
first,
that
you
can
use
the
decision,
the
judgment,
the
summary
judgment
motion
to
determine
what
are
the
necessary
allegations
of
the
complaint.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
ordinarily,
and
it
would
be
the
first
issue
if
the
question
were
state
versus
federal
jurisdiction,
but
the
alternative
basis
for
jurisdiction
here
would
be
under
the
anti-trust
laws.
so,
there's
no
question
of
federal
jurisdiction
per
se.
so,
the
question
didn't
come
up
at
that
time.
it
was
either,
you
know,
patent--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--i
use
the
judgment
as
just
one
way
to
interpret
the
complaint,
your
honor.
the
summary
judgment
motion
itself,
the
theory
of
the
summary
judgment
motion
helps
to
interpret
the
complaint.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
this
is
similar
to
justice
stevens'
question
that
an
amendment,
for
example,
of
a
complaint
is
something
that
comes
after
the
complaint
and
would
change,
could
change
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
a
case
that
has
no
patent
element
in
it
could
be
amended...
amended
complaint
filed
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
at
that
point.
after
the
beginning
of
the
case,
would
be
based,
in
part,
on
section
1338,
and
the
federal
circuit
has
interpreted
its
jurisdiction
in
response
to
a
question
asked
to
my
adversary,
has
interpreted
its
amendment
jurisdiction
this
way.
it
has
recognized
amendments
that
either
add
a
patent
claim
or
delete
a
patent
claim
as
effecting
its
jurisdiction
and
has
very
recently
interpreted
consolidation
to
have
the
same
effect.
those
cases
are
cited,
i
believe,--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--no.
it
went
beyond
that.
it
declared
the
patents
invalid,
first.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
perhaps
a
threshold
step,
but,
nevertheless,
the
result
was--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--the
validity
which
we
could
no
longer
enforce
those
patents.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
the...
well,
can
i
answer
that
question
first
with
respect
to
the
district
court?
the
district
court,
in
its
decision,
granted
first
the
patent
invalidity
relief;
second,
the
trade
secret
invalidity
and
disgorgement
relief;
and,
then,
third,
imposed
damage
liability
with
a
trial
to
be
held
at
another
time.
so,
it
didn't
reach
the
amount
of
damages.
but
all
of
that
relief
flowed,
and
this
is
inescapable
from
reading
the
district
court's
decision,
flowed
from
the
patent
violations.
there
were
no
independent
anti-trust
issues--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--it
could
not
in
the
present
form.
perhaps
the
best
analogy
would
be--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--this
case
as
liability
was
imposed
could
not.
this
case
would
be
a
patent
case
because,
fundamentally,
liability
was
imposed
solely
as
a
basis--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--because
it
is
a
patent
case
and,
therefore,--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
we
didn't
think
about
it
at
the
time,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
well,
we
also
had...
if
you're
reading
our
response
to
paragraph
18,
we
also
denied
the
allegation
which
we
interpreted
in
paragraph
18
to
be
an
assertion
of
patent
and
trade
secret
invalidity.
so,
we
began
by
denying
that
allegation.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
i
think
that
the
allegations
may
not
match
each
other,
your
honor.
perhaps
it's
poor
draftsmanship.
it
perhaps
should
have
read
as
an
averral
of
patent
validity.
paragraph
18
is
a
confusing
paragraph,
and
we
would
all
have
been
better
served
had,
as
judge
nichols
said
in
his
dissent,
we
called
for
an
amended
complaint
at
the
time
or
a
more
definite
statement
of
what
the
complaint
was,
but
we
did
not,
and
now
we
must
try
to
interpret
what
that
complaint
means,
and
it's
our
position
that
the
way
that
one
can...
the
best
way,
the
most
reliable
way
to
determine
what
the
necessary
allegations
are
of
plaintiff's
real
case
is
to
look
at
the
summary
judgment
motion,
to
look
at
the
claim
that
was
actually
litigated
and
actually
adjudicated.
whether
we
do
that
under
the...
following
the
principles
of
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule,
there
are
cases
that
go
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
bare
words
of
the
complaint
to
try
to
interpret
what
are
the
necessary
allegations
of
the
complaint,
or
whether
we
apply
rule
15(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
we
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
rule
15(b),
even
without
a
formal
amendment,
requires
that
the
pleadings
be
treated
as
amended
to
conform
to
the
proof.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
if
it
comes
up
under
1295,
only
as
regards
the
federal
circuit's
jurisdiction
versus
another
appellate
court's
jurisdiction,
and
it's
only
at
that
stage
that
you
have
a
record
in
between--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--i
think
it's
consistent,
your
honor.
the
cases...
i'm
sorry.
the
federated
department
store
case,
for
example,
looked
at
matters
outside
the
bare
pleadings.
it
looked
at
the
belated
litigation
to
determine...
that
was
the
case
where
a
state
anti-trust
action
was
brought,
but
there
had
been
a
prior
action,
the
plaintiffs
had
discontinued
their
action
and
tried
to
file
the
same
action
in
state
court,
and
the
courts
below
and
the
supreme
court
affirmed,
looked
at
the
related
litigation
to
determine
what
the
real
cause
of
action
was,
and,
so,
i
think
what
we're
saying
is
really
consistent
with
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule,
but
it
operates...
it
certainly
does
not
change
the
inquiry
that
must
be
addressed
when
the
question
is
federal
jurisdiction
per
se.
that
question
must
be
addressed
at
the
outset
of
the
case
where
virtually
all
you
have
is
the
complaint.
perhaps
a
removal
petition.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
but
a
case
can
change,
particularly
complex
litigation,
and,
therefore,
the
jurisdictional
basis
can
change.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
that's
one
thing,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
it
is
fixed.
number
one,
it
can
change.
number
two,
we
do
read
this
complaint
as
a
patent
complaint
and
we
did
so
at
the
time,
and
one
of
the
reasons
we
did
was
because
this
was
not
the
first
time
we
had
seen
this
issue.
in
the
springfield
litigation,
which
we
brought
mr.
christianson
into
the
springfield
litigation
as
a
defendant,
in
that
action,
we
were
also
seeking
to
enforce
trade
secrets.
the
defense
in
that
action
was
this
section
112
theory
that
our
trade
secrets
and
patents
were
invalid
because
of
112.
the
action
went
up
on
appeal,
got
a
preliminary
injunction,
and
we
were
upheld.
the
preliminary
injunction
was
upheld.
so
that
when
we
drop
christianson
after
we
went
back
to
the
district
court,
he
turned
around
and
filed
this
complaint,
the
instant
complaint.
we
interpret
it
as
turning
the
defense
into
an
offense.
we
had
seen
the
issue
before.
that's
the
way
we
understood
it
at
the
time.
i
certainly
recognize
this
is
not
an
easy
complaint
to
read.
it's
not
a
model
of
draftsmanship,
and
that's
why
i
suggest
that
looking
at
the
subsequent
proceedings
assists
the
district
court
or
the
appellate
court
in
determining
what
the
complaint
really
means.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
those
motions
were
available
to
us.
we
did
not
make
them.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
well,
i
think
rule
15(b)
was
written
precisely
for
this
situation,
that
where
the
parties
had
not
recognized
or
the
court
has
not
recognized
the
change
in
the
theory
between
pleading
and
trial,
that
one...
de
facto,
it
should
be
recognized
and
considered
an
amended
pleading.
we...
and
the
course
of
events
was
only
about
four
or
five
months
between
this
complaint
and
the
bringing
of
the
summary
judgment
motion,
we
cross
moved
for
summary
judgment
motion,
but
it
really
just
met
the
section
112
theory.
the
motions
didn't
go
beyond
that.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
well,
they
could
be.
they
could
be.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
yes.
we've
never
reached
that
stage.
we're
not...
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
ways
because
of
the
diversity
between
the...
the
divergence
between
the
original
complaint
and
what
we
were
held
liable
for.
there's
two
ways
of
looking
at
this
action.
one
is
that
it's
solely
a
patent
action,
that
it
was
brought
as
an
action
to
declare
patents
invalid,
which
is
a
recognized
action
that
arises
under
the
patent
laws,
and
that
the
relief
went
too
far.
the
judge
took
the
unprecedented
step
of
patent
violations
and
disgorged
trade
secrets.
secondly,
to
try
to
reconcile
the
original
complaint,
for
example,
with
the
decision,
if
it's
an
action
that
arises
under
the
anti-trust
laws,
the
closest
analogy
that
we
could
use
would
be
the
walker
process
kind
of
case.
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
here
arises...
it's...
i'm
sorry.
the
action
created
by
the
anti-trust
laws
would
be
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
the
plaintiff
is
proceeding
to
show
that
our
patents
are
invalid
and
that
the
enforcement
of
those
patents
plus
all
the
other
elements
of
section
2
amounts
to
a
monopoly.
viewed
that
way,
we
must
come
to
the
same
conclusion,
though.
the
walker
process
teaches
and
the
related
cases
that
fundamental
to
such
an
anti-trust
claim
is
that
the
patents
must
not
only
be
invalid,
technically
invalid,
they
must
be
obtained
by
fraud
from
the
patent
office.
so,
inherent
in
plaintiffs'
claim,
not
a
defense,
is
the
invalidity
element,
and
this
law
has
been
applied
in
the
trade
secret
area,
too.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
in
the
walker
process
case,
it's
never
come
up.
certainly
not
at
the
federal
circuit
level.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
the
closest
case...
the
only
case
that
i'm
aware
of
is
the
handgards
case,
but...
i'm
sure
your
honor
is
familiar
with
that
one.
i
believe
you
were
on
one
of
the
panels.
at
the
time
that
issue
was
considered
and
the
regional
circuit
kept
the
case,
it
appears
to
me
from
the
decision
that
there
was
no
longer
a
patent
question
in
the
case.
it's
our
position
that
where
there
is
a
patent
invalidity
issue
at
the
heart
of
the
plaintiffs'
anti-trust
case,
the
issue,
the
case
arises
under
the
patent
laws
and
the
appeal
would
still
go
to
the
federal
circuit,
and
i
believe
what
little
there
is
in
the
statutory
history
is
consistent
with
this.
there
is
very
little
devoted
in
the
senate
report
to
the
hybrid-kind
of
patent
anti-trust
case,
but
there's
a
couple
of
things
that
are
notable.
there's
a
couple
of
statements
in
the
senate
report,
for
example,
that
says
specifically
that
they
expect
that
all
patent
appeals
to
go
to
the
federal
circuit.
they
were
more
concerned...
there
was
some
concern
expressed
that
a
frivolous
patent
appeal
be
attached
to
an
anti-trust
complaint
and
that
the
district
court
should
be
able
to
deal
with
this,
to
prevent
that
steering
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
circuit.
but
probably
the
most
that
is
said
on
the
subject
is
attached
to
the
senate
report.
i
think
it's
appendix
b,
which
is
a
letter
from...
to
senator
dole
from
the
office
of
court
administration
that
deals
with
the
kind
of
mixed
anti-trust
and
patent
questions,
and
it
characterizes
most
of
these
kinds
of
patent
abuse
claims,
including
the
walker
process
claim,
as
fundamentally
patent
issues
that
it
expected
would
go
to
the
patent
court,
to
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
if
you
are
on
the
seventh
circuit,
you
don't
get
the
case
until
the
trial
is
over
and
a
judgment
has
been
written.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
the
district
court
i
do
not
believe
either
has
the
power
nor
is
there
a
procedure
for
the
district
court
to
determine
the
appellate
court's
jurisdiction.
the
next
thing
that
would
happen
after
the
trial
and
the
judgment
is
one
of
the
parties
has
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
the
issue
would
come
up
if
the
other
party
questioned
where
that
notice
of
appeal
was
directed.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
not
constantly
shifting.
this
is
a
pretty
rare
case.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
whether--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--on
the
choice
of
law
question,
at
least
the
way
the
law
seems
to
be
developing,
the
federal
circuit
has
taken
the
position
that
in
areas
outside
its
specialty,
non-patent
areas,
it
would
apply
the
law
of
the
circuit.
so,
on
the
anti-trust
issues,
and
this
would
be
on
an
issue-by-issue
basis,
the
theory
would
be
that
the...
whether
in
the
regional
circuit
or
the
federal
circuit,
the
federal...
i'm
sorry.
the
regional
circuit's
anti-trust
law
should
apply.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
consistent
with
that
principle
is
that,
and
i
don't
know
that
there
has
been
a
holding
to
this
effect,
is
that
if
a
regional
circuit
got
a
patent
issue
is
it
should
defer,
there's
a
difference,
because
it
has
all
the
precedent.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
contrary
to
the
federal
circuit's
precedent
on
patent
law,
and
that's--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--no.
we
are--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--we
are
defending
that
the
federal
circuit
had
jurisdiction
and
the
rational--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--that
it
had
jurisdiction,
but
we
say
the
proper
rationale
for
its
jurisdiction
was
best
expressed
in
the
seventh
circuit's
decision.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
we
did
not
because
we
did
not
submit
a
cross
motion.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
we
are
defending
the
result.
we
are
not
seeking
any
relief
different
from
what--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--we
are
defending
the
judgment.
we
are
not
seeking
relief
or
result
different
from
what
the
federal
circuit
did.
we
do
defend
the
jurisdictional
basis
on
a
different
ground
than
what
the
federal
circuit
expressed.
we
think
it
had
expressly
under
the
statute
jurisdiction
because
this
was
the
patent
case.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
no,
your
honor.
we
don't
defend
the
interest
of
justice
basis
of
jurisdiction.
that,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
appears
to
just
provide
a
transfer
where
a
court
lacks
jurisdiction.
what
we
defend
is
the
court's
exercise
of
jurisdiction.
we
say
it
had
jurisdiction
to
reach
the
merits
and
it
had
jurisdiction
for
the
basis
expressed
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
exactly.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
that
is
precisely
our
position.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
i
think--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--i
think
whichever
way
you
rule,
you
necessarily
rule
on
the
other
position
because
if
the
federal
circuit
had
jurisdiction
here,
the
seventh--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--no.
we
try
to--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--that's
correct.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
i
believe
because
there's
been
several
cases
on
the
subject
in
the
federal
circuit
that's
inconsistent.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
they
cited
two
or
three,
maybe
both
of
those
go
the
same
way,
but
i
think
they
have
been
consistent
in
recognizing
that
the
amendment
affects
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
well,
it
looked
at
subsequent
developments
and
in
atari,
there
was
an
attempt
after
the
decision
to
separate
the
copyright
case
from
which
there
had
been
a
judgment
and
the
patent
part
of
the
complaint
and
the
federal
circuit
essentially
held
that
that
attempted
separation
was
not
affected.
it's
kind
of
a
unique
set
of
facts.
typically,
a
severance
would
occur
much
earlier.
it
really
didn't
reach
the
question
of
if
there
was
an
effective
severance
that
resulted
in
separate
trials
and
separate
judgments,
how
that
would
affect
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
they
did
look
at
subsequent
events,
and
i
think
that's...
i
don't
think
that
does
violence
to
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
that's
what
courts
have
done
where
they
are
confronted
with
either
a
poorly-drafted
complaint
or
a
changed
theory,
and
i
think
the
opposite
result
being
wedded
to
the
complaint
would
do
violence
to
the
congressional
purpose
here
because
you
could
manipulate
the
jurisdiction
by
attaching
a
federal
patent
claim
in
your
complaint,
abandon
it,
and
throughout
the
history
of
the
case,
all
appeals
would
go
to
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
i
don't
think
there's
been
any
inconsistency.
if
a
patent
claim
was
attached,
let's
say,
to
a
state
claim
and
the
court
assumed
jurisdiction
and
then
determined
that
the
patent
claim
was
frivolous,
i
don't
believe
the
district
court
is
supposed
to
proceed
with
jurisdiction.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
i'm
saying
that
that
is
the
most
advisable
rule
to
determine
appellate
jurisdiction.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
it
does.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
i'm
saying
it's
not
something
that
changes
minute-by-minute.
this
is
a
rather
unique
case
where
the
district
court--
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
--the
court
tried
a
federal
question
case,
in
this
case,
a
patent
question
case,
yes,
we
should
look
to
that
to
determine
appellate
jurisdiction.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
not
specifically.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
by
operation
of
rule
15(b).
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
the
language
of
rule
15(b)
amends
the
complaint,
but
this
situation
i
don't
think
could
come
up
under
normal
federal
jurisdiction
per
se
because
jurisdiction
is
determined
at
the
outset.
it
could
only
come
up
when
one
has
the
advantage
of
a
retrospective
analysis.
in
the
coastal
states
case,
i
believe,
which
determined
the
jurisdiction
of
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals
and
judge
newman,
which
ultimately
determined
that
it
was
issued
jurisdiction,
said
that
the
appellate
court
should
take
the
advantage
of
looking
in
retrospect
and
not
deal
just
with
the
frozen
words
of
the
original
complaint
because
it
is
better
able
to
determine
whether
that
is
the
kind
of
case
that
should
go
to
one
circuit
court
of
appeals
or
the
other.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
i
do
not
think
so.
it's
a
decision
that
i
think
is,
of
course,
on
the
merits,
eminently
correct.
it
applies
traditional
patent
law.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
has
had...
we
both
have
had
appellate
review
in
the
federal
circuit.
the
federal
circuit
reached
the
merits
and
it's
been
fully
briefed
and
argued.
obviously,
the
court
can
accept
certiorari
on
the
merits.
we
think
the
related
point
is
that,
you
know,
the
question
as
to
my
adversaries,
what
does
the
court
do
when
it
finds
that
the
seventh
circuit
really
had
jurisdiction,
and
there's
no
support
for
a
dismissal.
in
fact,
the
harley-davidson
v.
buffington
case
that
we
cited
in
our
briefs
says
that
our
right
to
an
appellate...
right
to
an
appeal
means
a
right
to
have
an
appellate
determination.
there
is
precedent
for
what
this
court
could
do
in
at
least
three
cases
as
recently
as
u.s.
v.
hohri,
where
the
court
determined
that
the
d.c.
circuit
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
but
the
federal
circuit
did.
it
simply
remanded
and
directed
a
transfer
under
the
transfer
section
of
1631.
that
is
the,
we
say,
appropriate
remedy
and
unless
the
court
does
want
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
patent
question.
mr.
anthony
m.
radice
i
think
it
raises
more
questions.
