justice
o'connor
well,
sometimes
it's
hard
to
know
the
answer
under
the
arising
under
standard.
should
any
special
presumption
or
expertise
be
given
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
in
deciding
those
questions
of
its
own
jurisdiction
or
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
counsel,
aren't
there
motions
that
you
might
have
made
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
to
force
an
amendment
of
the
complaint
or
force
a
more
definite
statement?
justice
o'connor
and
you
didn't
make
them,
and,
yet,
you
want
to
rely
on
it
as
though
those
things
had
been
done,
and
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
way
the
system
is
supposed
to
work.
justice
o'connor
wouldn't
damages
at
the
end
of
the
line
be
calculated
on
an
anti-trust
theory
no
matter
what
happened
to
the
patent?
justice
o'connor
wouldn't
they
have
to
be?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
it
started
in
a
state
court?
you
wouldn't
have
the
luxury
of
letting
the
district
court
resolve
it.
you'd
be
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
and
you'd
have
to
figure
out
where
it
belonged
under
your
theory.
