justice
white
what
if
we
decide
that
the
court
of
appeals
shouldn't
have
decided
the
merits?
why
shouldn't
we
just
remand
the
case
to
them?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
i
guess
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
some
sense
of
its
own
about
what
ought
to
be
done.
justice
white
if
you
decide
the
federal
circuit
had
jurisdiction,
the
federal
circuit
has
already
decided
the
merits.
justice
white
well,
yes,
but
we
told
you
to
brief
and
argue
the
second
question,
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
justice
white
if
we
decided
that
first
and
agreed
with
the
federal
circuit
as
to
jurisdiction,
we
could
just
say
then
that
they
shouldn't
have
decided
the
merits.
but
then
where
does
that
leave
the
case?
justice
white
there
is
none
here.
justice
white
well,
the
claim
is
that
the
case
went
forward
in
the
district
court
solely
or
principally
on
the
patent
issues.
justice
white
and,
so,
it's
as
though
the
complaint
hadn't
been
amended.
justice
white
what
i'm
saying
is
it's
just
as
though
there's
an
amended
complaint
filed
because
if
the
patent
issues,
we're
predominated.
justice
white
would
it
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense
in
terms
of
the
theory
of
the
federal
circuit
jurisdiction
to
say
that
if
a
case
turns
solely
on
a
patent
issue,
that
except
for
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule,
would
be
appealable
to
the
federal
circuit?
does
it
make
much
sense
to
apply
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
to
that,
and
in
this
case,
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
should
dispose
of
the
patent
issue
on
which
the
case
turns?
justice
white
why
did
it
reach
those
issues?
justice
white
by?
justice
white
well,
didn't
the
defendant
rely
on
the
patents?
justice
white
well,
what
about
in
the
answer
to
the
complaint?
justice
white
was
there
a
pre-trial
conference
or
was
there
just
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
white
well,
had
there
been
a
pre-trial
conference
outlining
the
issues?
justice
white
is
that
in
the
record?
i
suppose
it
is
somewhere.
