mr.
lefstein,
before
you
get
to
that,
what
exactly
do
you
want
us
to
do
with
this?
justice
marshall
no
more
than
that?
justice
marshall
what
happens
then?
justice
marshall
wouldn't
we
have
to
say
that?
justice
marshall
because
i
just
don't
know
what
position
the
case
is
in.
justice
marshall
we
have
a
court
that
says
i
don't
have
jurisdiction,
but
i
decide,
and
i
am
at
a
loss
as
to
what
you
do
with
a
decision
like
that.
justice
marshall
i
renew
my
question.
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
with
it?
justice
marshall
counsel,--
justice
marshall
--counsel,
i
might
have
missed
it.
are
you
defending
the
court's
decision
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction?
justice
marshall
it's
easy.
yes
or
no?
justice
marshall
that
it
did
not
have
it?
justice
marshall
cross
appeal?
justice
marshall
so,
my
question
is,
you're
not
defending
it?
justice
marshall
you
defend
the
judgment.
that's
all
you're
defending.
justice
marshall
do
we
have
to
rule
on
both
of
them?
justice
marshall
you
rely
on
the
seventh
in
that.
do
you
want
us
to
rule
that
both
of
them
are
correct?
justice
marshall
confusion.
that's
what
you
want.
justice
marshall
counsel,
help
is
at
hand.
