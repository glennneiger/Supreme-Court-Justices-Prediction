justice
scalia
excuse
me.
is
that
binding
on
the
united
states
authorities?
justice
scalia
the
foreign
bank
secrecy
laws?
justice
scalia
but
you
could
seek
to
compel
the
banks
to
do
it
despite
those
foreign
laws
and
take
some
action
against
the
domestic
subsidiaries
of
the
bank?
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
they
mean
communicative
to
the
fact-finder
at
the
trial
and
not
communicative
to
anyone
in
the
world?
if
i
may
pursue
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
you
think
that
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
key
case,
where
you
say
he
can...
the
government
can
compel
the
production
of
the
key
to
the
safe
deposit
box,
assuming
they
give
immunity
for
the
fact
of
the
production
of
the
key,
right?
justice
scalia
but
you
would
say
that
even
if
they
gave
immunity,
they
could
not
require
him
to
tell
the
guard
it's
all
right
to
let
these
investigators
in
to
get
into
my
safe
deposit
box.
if
he
has
a
private
guard
who
will
only
let
people
in
with
his
consent,
he
can
give
the
key
but
he
can't
tell
the
guard,
let
these
people
in.
that's
the
line
you're
drawing
here.
justice
scalia
because
that's
communicative.
justice
scalia
you
think
that's
a
reasonable
line
between
giving
the
key
and
telling
the
guard,
let
these
people
in?
justice
scalia
no,
not
to
use
at
trial.
not
to
use
at
a
trial
anyway.
justice
scalia
mr.
timbie,
in
the
absence
of
any
direct
authority,
maybe
we're
compelled
to
fall
back
upon
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment.
that's
a
drastic
step.
yes.
i
hate
to
suggest
it,
but
the...
it
does
not
read
that
no
one
shall
be
compelled
to
communicate
in
such
fashion
as
to
harm
his
case.
it
says
no
one
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
now,
how
is
this
action
here
causing
this
individual
to
be
a
witness
against
himself?
justice
scalia
why
is
that?
justice
scalia
but
it's
easy
to
extend
it
to
any
testimonial
utterance
by
the
defendant
that
can
be
used
against
him
at
trial.
that
can
be
used
for
its
truth
against
him
at
trial.
justice
scalia
once
you
establish
the
violation,
there
are
all
sorts
of
fruits
of
the
tree
that
also
fall
out.
why
isn't
it
enough
to
say
the
violation
has
to
be
some
testimony,
some
assertion
of
a
fact
or
the
truth
that
he
makes
which
is
used
at
trial
against
him?
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that,
too,
mr.
timbie,
but
are
you
sure
it's
the
fifth
amendment
that
makes
it
bad?
i
don't
think
the
government
could
ask
john
doe
out
on
the
street
to
do
that
either.
justice
scalia
i
am
saying
there's
some
limit
to
what
the
government
can
do
to
enlist
anybody
in
its
investigations.
i
don't
think
the
reason
it
can't
do
it
is
necessarily
that
this
person
is
under
indictment.
i
don't
think
you
could
ask
anybody
to
go
and
assist...
compel
anybody
to
assist
this
investigation
in
that
fashion.
justice
scalia
it
really
doesn't
waive
the
protection
as
was
just
pointed
out.
i
mean,
and
even
if
the
amicus
brief
had
not
been
filed,
it's
obviously
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
for
any
foreign
country
who
has
these
bank
laws
and,
indeed,
it
would
be
idiotic
if
they
didn't,
once
this
case
is
decided
the
way
you
want
it
decided,
for
them
to
simply
say,
moreover,
compelled
consent
is
not
sufficient.
that
will
be
in
the
bank
contract
and
then
you
can
do
these
proceedings
forever
and
it
will
never
get
you
the
information
you
want.
justice
scalia
well,
it's
done
all
the
time.
justice
scalia
tell
us
what
it's
a
problem
with
because
i'm
troubled
with
some
of
these
hypotheticals,
too.
i'm
troubled
with
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical.
you
wouldn't
feel
any
better
about
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
if
you
got...
if
you
granted
him
immunity
before
you
told
him
drive
the
car
down
to
the
courthouse,
would
you?
it
would
still
give
you
trouble.
so,
it
seems
to
me
there's
something
wrong
with
it,
but
it
may
not
be
the
fifth
amendment.
do
you
have
any
idea
what
makes
us
feel
bad
about
it?
justice
scalia
could
a
court
compel
his
aunt
to
drive
his
car
down?
can
his
aunt
have
the
car?
justice
scalia
issue
an
order
compelling
his
aunt
to
drive
the
car.
his
aunt
isn't
under
indictment
or
anything.
do
you
think
that
that
would
be--
justice
scalia
--you
don't
have
to
admit
it's
bad.
would
you
feel
funny
about
it
if
it
was
his
aunt
or
aunt,
however
you
say
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
rothfeld,
are
you
asserting
on
behalf
of
the
government
the
power
to
get
this
individual
to
do
because
he's
a
defendant
anything
that
you
couldn't
get
the
private
individual
to
do
who
is
not
a
defendant?
that
is,
to
put
it
in
the
context
of
this
case,
could
you
have
made...
could
you
have
gotten
a
similar
order
directed
against
someone
who
is
not
a
defendant
in
the
case?
suppose
the
bank
accounts
were
held
in
the
name
of
a
third
party,
totally
innocent
third
party,
who
is
not
implicated
in
the
conspiracy
at
all,
could
you
have
gotten
this
order
against
that
third
party?
justice
scalia
i
want
some
limitation
upon
what
you
can
do
to
this
defendant.
justice
scalia
you
don't
understand
the
point
of
my
question.
i'm
looking
for
some
limitation
on
what
we
can
get,
what
we
can
allow
you
to
do
to
a
defendant.
if
all
you're
coming
in
and
saying,
we
can
ask
this
defendant
to
produce
anything
we
can
ask
anyone
else
to
produce,
so
long
as
it
is
not
testimonial,
that's
one
position.
if
what
you're
arguing
on
the
other
hand
is
some
broader
proposition,
we
can
ask
defendants
to
do
things
that
we
couldn't
ask
non-defendants
to
do,
that's
something
quite
different.
now,
which
of
the
two
is
your
position
here?
justice
scalia
you
have
gotten
this
order
issued
to
someone
who
is
not
a
defendant,
yes
or
no,
do
you
think?
justice
scalia
can't
you
get
an
order
for
a
landlady
to
open
the
door
that
has
property
belonging
to
the
defendant,
and
if
this
much
different
from
that,
getting
someone
who
controls
the
bank
account
to
issue,
if
you
think
that
there
are
illegal
funds
in
the
account?
justice
scalia
i
am
not
inclined
to
say
that
you
can
do
more
to
this
defendant
than
you
can
do
to
an
innocent
third
party
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he's
a
defendant.
maybe
you
can
do
less,
but
i'm
certainly
not
going
to
say
that
you
can
make
him
do
it
if
you
can't
make
his
aunt
do
it.
yes,
but
your
problem
is...
i
didn't
catch
this
before,
but
the
jurisdictional
foundation
of
this
order
is
the
all
writs
act,
isn't
it?
