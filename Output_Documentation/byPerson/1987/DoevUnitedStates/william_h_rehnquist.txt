chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
86-1753,
john
doe
against
the
united
states.
mr.
timbie,
you
may
begin
whenever
you
wish.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what's
the
testimonial
about
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
government...
let's
say
nothing
is
as
esoteric
as
this
situation,
it's
a
murder
investigation,
the
government
issues
a
subpoena
to
a
prospective
indictee,
subpoena
all
the
guns
in
your
possession,
now
can
he
defend
against
that
on
the
grounds
that
producing
guns
might
incriminate
him?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
fisher
didn't
hold
that
there
was
any
significance
to
the
act
of
production.
it
was
debated
in
fisher,
but
it
wasn't
decided.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
doe
devoted
about
one
paragraph
to
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
my
question
is
that
the
idea
you're
pumping
for
may
not
be
as
well
established
as
you
think
it
is.
chief
justice
rehnquist
prior
to
fisher,
where
did
it
exist?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
timbie.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
mr.
timbie,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
immunity
wouldn't
be
any...
you
wouldn't
say
if
the
government
were
to
compel
him
to
consent
to
a
waiver
of
his
attorney-client
privilege,
that
would
be
all
right
if
he
were
immunized?
i
mean,
that
is
bad,
but
for
a
reason
quite
apart
from
the
fifth
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
timbie.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-1753,
doe
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
