mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it's
helpful
at
the
outset
to
make
clear
exactly
what
is
not
controverted
in
this
case.
both
sides
agree
that
the
bank
records
sought
by
the
government
are
not
themselves
privileged
under
the
fifth
amendment.
both
sides
agree
that
the
banks
that
hold
the
documents
can't
assert
the
fifth
amendment
in
declining
to
turn
them
over.
both
sides
agree
that
the
petitioner
has
no
fifth
amendment
right
to
keep
the
banks
from
disclosing
the
documents.
both
sides
agree
the
government
has
to
find
the
banks
where
petitioner
has
his
accounts
through
its
own
investigation
and
once
the
government
does
find
those
accounts,
both
sides
agree
that
the
only
thing
that
will
keep
the
banks
from
surrendering
the
account
records
are
foreign
bank
secrecy
bank
laws
that
have
no
force
in
the
united
states.
i
think
mr.
timbie
acknowledged
all
these
points
in
his
argument.
nonetheless,
petitioner
insists
that
the
fifth
amendment
somehow
gives
him
a
constitutional
right
to
continue
to
enjoy
the
protection
of
the
foreign
bank
secrecy
laws,
even
though
the
act
of
waiving
that
protection,
the
consent
form
itself,
concededly
does
not
give
the
government
any
information
that
will
advance
its
investigation.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
let
me
say
several
things
in
response
to
that,
justice
scalia.
idiotic
or
not,
the
fact
does
have
some
effect.
it
is
true
that
a
court
in
the
cayman
islands
has
concluded
that
as
a
matter
of
cayman
laws,
these
consent
forms
are
in
effect
if
that
decision
was
not
appealed.
so,
cayman
law,
i
think,
is
not
settled.
but
there
are
other
jurisdictions
that
have,
even
assuming
that
that
settles
cayman
law
for
all
time,
there
are
other
jurisdictions
that
have
bank
secrecy
provisions
either
by
statute
or
by
common
law,
including
bermuda
and
the
united
kingdom,
bermuda
is
involved
in
this
case,
and
my
understanding
is
although
there
are
no
reported
cases
from
those
jurisdictions,
in
fact,
banks
in
those
jurisdictions
comply
with
these
compel
consents
because
they
interpret
their
common
law
bank
secrecy
protections
as
having
an
exception
for
when
compel
consent
forms
of
this
kind
are
used.
so,
i
think
that
they
are
useful
and,
of
course,
there
are
a
great
many
other
jurisdictions
that
have
widely
varying
kinds
of
bank
secrecy
laws.
so,
this
is
not
a
sham
proceeding,
and
i
should
say,
in
addition,
to
the
extent
that
a
consent
form
won't
be
useful
for
us,
that's
our
problem.
that
is
not
a
solution
to
the
petitioner's
case
here.
it
doesn't
have
any
bearing
on
the
fifth
amendment
question
of
whether
it
can
be
compelled
to
execute
the
consent,
which
we
can
then
try
to
use
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction.
so,
i
think
it
is
extremely
useful
proceeding.
i
should
add
one
additional
practical
point.
to
the
extent
that
mr.
timbie
suggested
that
we
can
simply
obtain
these
records
easily
enough
by
serving
subpoenas
on
the
domestic
branches
of
foreign
banks,
that's
not
entirely
true
because
those
banks
can
contests
subpoenas
and
argue
that
under
comity
principles,
they
should
not
be
required
to
surrender
the
records,
and
i'm
sure
that
the
banks,
and
mr.
timbie
if
he
were
in
a
position
to
do
so,
would
argue
that
they
should
not
surrender
those
records.
so
far
as
banks
that
don't
have
branches
in
the
united
states
are
concerned,
in
which
you
must
attempt
to
obtain
records
by
going
to
foreign
nations,
under
comity
principles,
foreign
courts
are
often
reluctant
to
help
other
countries
enforce
their
revenue
laws.
so,
these
consent
forms
may
be
the
only
way
for
us
to
obtain
this
information.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
let
me
answer
that
question
in
two
parts,
justice
o'connor.
we
think,
first
of
all,
if
the
government--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--we
think
that
if
the
government
were
to
do
so,
it
would
not
present
any
fifth
amendment
problem,
and
i'll
explain
that
later
on.
my
short
answer
to
your
question
is
we
do
not
think
that
this
would
be
admissible.
we
think,
as
we
explained
in
our
briefs,
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--not
for
fifth
amendment
reasons.
we
think
that
it
doesn't
have
any
significant
evidentiary
value.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
as
i
suggest,
we
don't
think
it
would
happen,
but,
no,
we
do
not
think
the
fifth
amendment
would
prohibit
if
someone
could
possibly
imagine
a
situation
in
which
the
bank
consent
form
were
introduced,
and
i
think
that
that
comes
clear
from
the
nature
of
the
fifth
amendment
guarantee
that
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
call
upon
here.
we
think
the
court
has
already
settled
the
principles
that
control
this
case
and
has
settled
them
against
the
petitioner.
the
court
has
made
it
very
clear,
we
think,
that,
and
i'll
return
to
your
question
and
address
it
in
detail
when
i
set
out
the
background
which
i
think
provides
the
answer
to
your
question,
but
the
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
fifth
amendment
can
be
asserted
only
when
the
government
tries
to
compel
someone
to
do
something
that
is
incriminating
and
testimonial,
and
we
think
the
court
has
made
equally
clear
time
and
again
that
something
is
testimonial
only
as
that
word
suggests,
it
has
the
nature
of
testimony.
that
is,
when
it
tells
the
government
something
about
the
crime.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
consent
form,
that
is
at
issue
here,
and
requiring
the
petitioner
to
put
his
signature
on
a
consent
form,
requires
him
to,
perform
a
testimonial
act
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decisions,
and
we
think
that
it
quite
clearly
does
not.
there
should
not
be
any
controversy
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
testimony
in
the
fifth
amendment
setting.
the
court,
in
its
opinion
in
fisher,
we
think,
made
it
quite
clear
that
something
is
testimonial
when
it
involves,
in
the
court's
words,
"truth
telling"
by
the
witness,
by
the
suspect,
and
the
court
has
made
it
quite
clear,
made
it
quite
clear
the
kinds
of
things
that
are
not
testimony.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
if
a
bank
produces
records
in
response
to
a
subpoena
accompanied
by
a
consent
form,
the
bank
may
be
making
an
implicit
statement
that
it
thinks
the
records,
as
justice
kennedy
suggested,
that
it
thinks
the
records
belong
to
the
suspect.
but
the
suspect
himself
isn't
making
any
statement
and
he
has
no
right
to
keep
the
bank
silent.
the
suspect
in
that
case
is--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
the
court
has
made
quite
clear
the
kinds
of
things
that
are
not
testimonial.
something
is
not
testimonial
simply
because
it
makes
the
suspect
the
source
of
incriminating
evidence.
that
was
the
holding
in
schmerber,
where
a
suspect
was
required
to
provide
incriminating
blood
samples.
the
court
has
made
quite
clear
that
something
is
not
testimonial,
a
witness'
act
is
not
testimonial,
but
simply
because
it
may
lead
to
the
production
of
incriminating
evidence
by
the
third
party,
that
was
the
holding
in
holt
and
in
wade,
where
suspects
were
required
to
put
on
clothing
worn
by
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime
to
facilitate
witness
identification.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we
don't
think
we
have
to
resort
to
it.
we
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
it
is
a
verbal
act.
we
certainly
acknowledge...
if
the
consent
form
set
out
information,
if
it
said
i
have
accounts
in
the
bank
of
nova
scotia
in
account
number
xyz,
and
i'm
telling
you
this,
and
you
can
now
take
this
information
and
go
get
my
records,
certainly
that
would
be
testimonial.
it
would
be
telling
the
government
something
and
providing
information.
the
consent
form
doesn't
do
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment,
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
probably
not.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
would
thank
that
there
would
be
potentially
due
process
problems.
i'm
not
sure
precisely.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
there
may
be
due
process
problems
in
locking
someone
up
until
they--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
the
government
were
to
take
someone
without
any
court
process
whatsoever
and
simply
throw
them
in
jail
for
months
on
end
until
they
did
sign
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
quite
right.
maybe
i
misunderstood
justice
stevens'
question.
my...
let
me
take
a
step
back.
petitioner
has
offered
this
parade
of
horribles
of
the
various
things
the
government
might
do
if
it
prevails
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that
those
are
really
red
herrings.
they're
not
horribles.
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
what
the
fifth
amendment
prevents
the
government
from
doing,
and
that's
the
only
question
presented
in
the
petition.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
there
are
a
variety
of
things.
one
horrible
that
they
suggest
that
the
government
might
compel
people
to
consent
to
searches
of
their
homes.
well,
obviously,
the
fourth
amendment
would
prevent
that.
one
horrible
they
suggest
is
the
government
might
compel
people
to
direct
their
attorneys
to
disclose
confidential
communications.
well,
the
attorney-client
privilege,
which
is
recognized
by
american
law,
unlike
the
bank
secrecy
privilege,
would
prevent
the
government
from
doing
that.
various
other
things
might
be
prevented
by
the
due
process
clause,
and
even
apart
from
that,
the
government,
before
it
compels
someone
to
do
something
or,
more
particularly,
the
district
court,
before
it
compels
somebody
to
do
something
on
pain
of
contempt
which
is
what's
going
on
here,
must
have
jurisdiction
and
authority
to
do
it.
must
have
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
from
somewhere.
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
held
correctly
that
the
all
writs
act
provides
jurisdiction
for
the
entry
of
due
order
here,
but
there
are
limits
to
the
extent
to
which
the
statutes
like
the
all
writs
act
can
provide
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
would
think
so.
i
mean,--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
this
is
harking
back
to
the
justice
stevens
safe
deposit
box
hypothetical,
and
i
think
that
if
the
possession
of
the
material,
the
evidence,
whatever,
in
the
suspect's
hands
is
a
foregone
conclusion
in
the
words
of
fisher,
requiring
the
suspect
to
perform
the
act
of
it
is
not
incriminating.
i
think
that
a
better...
to
introduce
yet
another
hypothetical,
a
better--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
may
be
that
i'm
not
understanding.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
our
position
is
compelling
someone
to
produce
something
when
there
is
leaving
aside
of
the
testimonial
aspects
attendant
upon
the
act
of
production.
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
problem.
and
to
the
extent
that
petitioner
had
in
his
possession
a
bit
of
evidence
and
it
was
conceded
that
the
evidence
was
in
his
possession,
he
was
not
disputing...
he
was
not
saying
there
will
be
any
testimonial
component
to
his
turning
over
to
the
government,
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
because
the
fifth
amendment,
the
court
has
said
time
and
again,
can
be
asserted
only
when
the
suspect
is
compelled
to
do
something
which
has
a
testimonial
and
the
quite
clear
that
the
simple
fact
that
the
suspect
is
required
to
manufacture
incriminating
evidence
does
not
by
itself
make
it
testimonial.
that
was
the
holding
in
gilbert
and
in
wade
and
in
dionisio.
suspects
were
required
to
produce
incriminating--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--orders
requiring
the
accused
to
produce--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
typically
there
are
disputes
as
to
whether
or
not
the
act
of
production
will
lead
to
courts
drawing...
will
have
any
testimonial
component
that
is
incriminating.
i
think
that
people
typically
don't
stipulate
that
they
have
possession
of
stolen
property
and
that
may
be
an
explanation
as
to
why
this
sort
of
thing
typically
doesn't
happen.
now,
i
should
take
a
step
back
from
that
hypothetical,
if
i
can,
and
say
that
this
case
doesn't
present
any
problems
such
as
that
because
there
is
no
testimonial
component
to
what
the
petitioner
is
being
asked
to
do,
concede
or
otherwise.
he
is
not
being
asked
to
turn
over
anything
in
his
possession.
he
is
simply
being
asked
to
sign
a
piece
of
paper
which
may
or
may
not
have
a
legal
effect
in
the
cayman
islands
and
bermuda
and
will
allow
banks
to
turn
over
documents
in
their
possession
permitting
the
banks
to
make
their
implicit
statements
that
they
believe
these
records
to
belong
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
give
you
a
compelling
answer
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
our
view
has
been
that
this
is
simply
not
the
testimonial
sort
of
thing
which
is
going
to
appear
in
evidence.
therefore,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
immunity
has
to
be
provided
against
use
of
the
consent
form
in
evidence,
whether
or
not
that
should
be
granted.
i
think
that
there
may
be
concerns
of
granting
immunity
and
if
that
is
imagined
to
be
a
concession
that
there
is
a
testimonial
component
may
lead
to
fruits
arguments
when
records
are
produced.
we
think
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
the
grant
of
immunity
because
there
is
no
testimonial
component.
there
is
no
fifth
amendment--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
we
have
to...
in
any
investigation
of
this
sort,
we
have
to
have
some
idea
of
where
those
records
are.
we
have
to
serve
the
banks
with
subpoenas
which
lead
to
the
production.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
if
we
just
simply
had
a
general
idea--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
fifth
amendment
problem
in
that.
again,
whether
or
not
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
that
order--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
true,
but
i
don't
think...
t
court
has
made
quite
clear
that
is
not
the
problem
under
the
fifth
amendment.
it--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i'm
not
sure
why
you
feel
bad
about
it,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
there
are
a
variety
of
protections
in
the
law
against
either
arbitrary
use
of
the
court's
power
to
compel
people
to
do
things
or
against
government
intrusion.
the
fourth
amendment
provides
protections.
the
due
process
clause
provides
protection.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
again,--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens.
the
other...
and
let
me
give
you
two
answers
to
that.
the
one
immediate
answer
is
the
other
limitation
on
government
power
and
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
compel
people
to
do
things
is
that
there
must
be
a
grant
of
authority
somewhere.
clearly,
here,
to
effectuate
a
properly-issued
subpoena,
the
court
under
the
all
writs
act,
we
think,
effectuated
the
enforcement
of
the
subpoena
by
requiring
this
compulsion,
this
signing
of
the
compelled
consent.
but
that
is
not
necessarily
going
to
be
the
case
where
the
district
court
simply
says
i
want
you
to
do
something,
suspect,
that
will
assist
the
government.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
all--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--whether
or
not
i
would
feel
funny
about
it,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
provides
the
answer
to
the
fifth
amendment
question
in
this
case.
now,
in
answering
justice
kennedy,
all
i
meant
to
suggest
is
there
is
no
fifth
amendment--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--all
we
want
is
for
the
bank
to
give
us
something,
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
testimony,
but
that
is
the
bank's
testimony.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
is
the
bank's
testimony,
if
anyone's.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
whether
or
not
the
bank
records--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
there
is
a
profound
difference
in
the
fifth
amendment.
the
fifth
amendment
only--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
court
has
made
clear,
justice
marshall,
that
the
crucial
point
is
whether
or
not
the
witness
is
compelled
to
do
something
that
is
testimonial
in
nature.
if
the
bank
produces
these
records
and
the
bank
makes
its
statement
that
these
are
the
records
that
belong
to
the
petitioner,
that
is
the
bank
statement
and
we
are
free
to
use
it.
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
has
done
something
that
allows
us
to
obtain
the
evidence,
and
i
think
this
answers
questions
that
were
posed
by
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
and
justice
stevens,
that
does
not
raise
a
fifth
amendment
problem.
it
is
quite
clear
in
a
case
where
the
suspect
provides
a
handwriting
exemplar
or
voice
exemplar.
the
suspect
is
required
to
do
something
that
would
lead
other
parties
to
produce
very
incriminating
evidence.
the
suspect
provides
a
handwriting
exemplar
and
the
government
obtains
handwriting
experts
who
develop
complex
analyses
and
produce
evidence
and
testify
themselves.
the
suspect
has
been
required
to
do
something
that
facilitates
the
government's
case,
that
allows
the
government
to
produce
incriminating
evidence
from
third
parties,
but
that
not
raise
the
fifth
amendment
problem.
the
court
made
that
clear
eighty
years
ago
in
holt
and
has
repeatedly
reaffirmed
that
principle.
it
is
only
when
the
suspect
is
required
to
do
something
himself
that
is
testimonial
that
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
some
sense
makes
him
a
witness
against
himself.
a
witness
does
not
take
the
stand
and
as
petitioner
has
been
ordered
to
do
in
this
case,
ask
a
third
party
to
produce
evidence.
a
witness
takes
the
stand
and
testifies.
he
tells
a
story.
he
explains
what
happened,
and
the
suspect
here
is
not
being
required
to
do
anything
like
that.
now,
to
return
very
briefly
to
the
hypothetical,
i'm
not
sure
which
number
hypothetical
it
is,
but
one
of
the
hypotheticals
offered
by
justice
stevens
or
justice
scalia,
if
the
aunt
is
ordered
to
drive
a
car
in,
that
may
offend
us
but
that
is
not
a
fifth
amendment
problem.
whether
or
not
the
court's
power
under
the
all
writs
act,
even
assuming
it
had
the
power
to
compel
the
suspect
to
drive
the
car,
extends
to
the
aunt
may
be
a
difficult
question,
but
it's
not
presented
here.
the
only
issue
raised
by
the
petitioner
is
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
involves
a
meeting
of
the
all
writs
act
or
other
jurisdictional
provisions
that
i
don't
want
to
get
into.
it
may
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
government
had
other
means
of
effectuating
the
subpoena.
but
that
is
not
a
question
here.
the
question
here
is
the
fifth
amendment
problem,
and
petitioner
has
not
offered
any
reason
to
believe
that
what
he
is
required
to
do
here
implicates
the
language,
the
policies
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
any
decision
of
this
court.
now,
the
court,
as
i
said
before,
has
made
very
clear
that
it's
only
when
there
is
a
testimonial
component
to
the
compelled
action,
compelled
statement,
that
there's
a
fifth
amendment
problem.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
don't
think...
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
as
dictum.
i
think
that
that
is
the
rational
for
the
line
the
court
has
drawn
in
requiring
testimonial
component.
the
court
has
taken
the
view
that
when
a
suspect
is
required
to
speak
his
guilt
and
disclose
the
contents
of
his
mind
to
the
government,
that
becomes
an
inquisitorial
type
of
proceeding.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
offhand,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
authority
directly
addressing
that
question,
justice
stevens.
unfortunately,
that
is
certainly
not
anything
close
to
the
issue
in
this
case.
i
mean,
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
case,
in
your
hypothetical,
the
witness
has
been...
the
suspect
has
been
compelled
to
say
something
testimonial,
to
disclose
what
he
knows
about
the
crime,
to
make
factual
assertions
that
are
true
or
false.
that
is
not
true
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
once
again,
i
have
to
fall
back
on
the
proposition
that
that
is
not
a
question
that's
presented
in
this
case
because
we
think
that
in
that
situation,
there
would
not
be
a
fifth
amendment
problem.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
excuse
me,
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
they
may
be
in
the
names
of
other
parties,
but
we
believe
that
they
are
controlled
by
the
petitioner
and
that's
an
important
point.
i
think
to
answer
your
question,
justice--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
is
the
first.
we
are
not
saying
that
his
status
as
a
target
of...
he's
not
a
defendant,
he's
a
target
of
the
grand
jury,
puts
him
in
any
different
position
so
far
as
the
fifth
amendment
is
concerned.
we
think
the
limitation
on...
the
fifth
amendment
limitation
on
what
we
can
do
is
the
same
in
either
case,
whether
or
not
someone
is
compelled
to
incriminate
themselves.
now,
there
are
distinctions
in
the
all
writs
act,
for
example,
in
grants
of
authority
to
the
courts,
as
to
the
relationship
between
the
person
who
is
being
compelled
to
produce
something
at
the
proceeding.
the
court
in
the
new
york
telephone
case
talks
about
whether
or
not
that
makes
any
difference.
so,
it
may
be,
justice
scalia,
that
there
are
things
that
the
district
courts
have
authority
to
do.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
that
question,
justice
scalia,
because
that
involves
the
meaning,
i
think,
of
the
all
writs
act,
which
grants
the
court
jurisdiction
to
enter
orders
of
this
sort,
which
simply
has
not
been
addressed
by
the
parties
to
this
point.
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
a
closer
question
under
that
statute
than
the
case
in
which--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--in
fifth
amendment
terms,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
distinction
between...
i
understand
the
problem
you
are
having,
justice
scalia,
is
that
we
concede
there
are
all
sorts
of
limitations
on
what
the
government
can
do
that
are
found
elsewhere
in
the
constitution,
elsewhere
in
the
statutes
and
by
negative
implications,
the
lack
of
authority
granted
to
the
district
courts
to
compel
people
to
do
things,
and
it
may
be
that
in
all
of
the
hypotheticals
that
are
presented
by
the
court,
the
government
won't
be
able
to
do
it
because
it
has
no
authority
to
do
it
or
because
some
other
constitutional
provision
keeps
us
from
doing
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
was--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
was
the
foundation.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
may
well
be
the
case,
justice
stevens.
so
far...
once
again,
to
return
to
the
question
that
concerns
justice
scalia,
so
far
as
the
fifth
amendment
is
concerned,
it
creates
a
general
bar,
a
limited
but
general
bar
on
what
the
government
can
do
to
people
and
compel
them
to
do,
whether
or
not
they
are
defendants
or
targets
or
whatever.
so
far
as
grants
of
authority
to
the
district
court
can
exercise
jurisdiction
over
people,
there
may
or
may
not
be
distinctions
granted
in
the
jurisdictional
statute,
but
that
is
not
the
question
here.
the
petitioner
has
chosen
to
present
only
one
question
and
that
is
the
fifth
amendment
question,
and
as
i
said
before,
he
offers
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
the
government
from
doing
what
it
did
in
this
case.
all
he
says
is
this
is
a
communication
and,
therefore,
it
must
be
testimonial,
but
that
is
clearly
not
true.
the
court
has
used
the
word
"communication"
in
its
opinions
as
a
synonym
for
factual
assertion
for
communication
of
evidence
to
the
government.
the
court's
actual
language
in
schmerber,
which
petitioner
relies
upon,
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
only
prohibits
accused
when
compelled
to
testify
against
himself
or
provide
evidence
of
a
testimonial
or
communicative
nature.
petitioner
has
not
provided
any
evidence
of
any
sort
to
the
government.
he
has
simply
authorized
other
people
to
provide
evidence.
he
is
in
no
different
situation
than
a
suspect
who
is
linked
to
a
handwriting...
to
a
ransom
note
in
the
government's
possession
by
a
handwriting
exemplar
that
he
was
forced
to
produce
and
that
was
then
analyzed
by
a
government
expert.
he
allowed
for
the
production
of
evidence
by
other
people,
but
the
court
has
said
that
does
not
create
an
inquisitorial
system.
inquisitorial
is
when
the
suspect
is
required
to
disclose
the
contents
of
his
own
mind.
petitioner
has
suggested
that
this
form
does
somehow
disclose
his
own
mind
because
it
reveals
that
he
actually
consents
to
the
release
of
his
documents.
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
the
form
says
on
its
face
that
it
was
entered
pursuant
to
a
court
order.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
petitioner
actually
wants
his
banks
to
release
his
bank
records.
once
again,
in
that
situation,
in
that
sense,
the
petitioner
is
in
no
different
situation
than
a
suspect
or
defendant
who
is
required
to
write
out
a
ransom
note
to
produce
a
handwriting
exemplar
for
the
government.
the
suspect
simply
has
not
done
anything
that
is
testimonial,
and
the
court
has
said
again
and
again
that
having
a
testimonial
component
is
the
essence
of
the
sort
of
thing
that
is
prohibited
by
the
fifth
amendment.
the
government
obtains
bank
records,
uses
them
against
the
petitioner,
it
will
not
relieve
its
burden
of
establishing
its
own
case
because
he
has
spoken
his
guilt
in
some
sense
because
he
hasn't
said
anything
about
his
guilt
or
about
what
went
on
in
this
case.
it
would
not
be
a
situation
in
the
language
by
the
court
thirty
years
ago
in
its
ullmann
decision
in
which
the
accused
was
convicted
because
of
disclosures
from
his
own
mouth.
he
hasn't
made
any
disclosures.
all
he
has
done
is
permit
the
government
to
obtain
evidence
from
a
third
party
and
to
return
to
justice
stevens'...
one
of
the
many
hypotheticals
justice
stevens'
safe
deposit
hypothetical,
it's
simply
a
situation
similar
to
the
one
that
would
be
presented
if
a
suspect
required
not
to
lock
his
safe
deposit
box,
so
that
people
could
get
into
it.
this
is
simply
permitting
the
government
to
obtain
evidence
that
can
be
used
against
him
at
trial.
the
evidence
that
will
be
provided
by
third
parties.
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
language,
certainly
in
the
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment,
or
in
any
of
this
court's
decision
as
petitioner
concedes
that
requires
the
court
to
rule
for
him
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
and
we
think
this
court
should
affirm
its
decision.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
