justice
o'connor
--mr.
timbie,
what
actual
potential
use
of
the
form
do
you
say
is
testimonial
here?
justice
o'connor
well,
why
isn't
that
much
like
taking
blood
or
getting
the
handwriting
sample?
justice
o'connor
direct
authority
meaning
physical
evidence
in
a
sense?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
timbie,
don't
you
suppose
the
due
process
clause
addresses
some
of
your
concerns
about
other
potential
uses
to
which
the
government's
logic
might
lead?
justice
o'connor
yeah.
there
may
be
some
protection
there,
and
i
would
appreciate
it
if
you'd
answer
my
question.
justice
o'connor
i
wanted
to
know
what
testimonial
use
of
the
consent
form
you're
relying
on
here.
justice
o'connor
well,
you
were
interrupted.
it's
not
your
fault,
but
i
would
like
to
know.
you
said--
justice
o'connor
mr.
rothfeld,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
government
can
introduce
into
evidence
for
any
purpose
whatever
the
consent
form?
justice
o'connor
against
the
person
signing
it?
justice
o'connor
you
take
the
position
that
it
could
not--
justice
o'connor
--but
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
prohibit
introduction--
justice
o'connor
--in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
even
for
authentication?
justice
o'connor
but
if
the
consent
form
were
to
be
offered
to
establish
that
these
are
the
records,
the
bank
records,
belonging
to
the
defendant,
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
why
that
wouldn't
be
testimonial.
justice
o'connor
but
if
the
government
introduces
the
consent
form,
then
perhaps
it
is
the
suspect
who
is
making
the
statement.
justice
o'connor
do
you
have
to
resort
then
to
saying
this
is
a
verbal
act
to
say
it
isn't
testimonial?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
would
prevent
the
government
from
doing
the
parade
of
horribles
suggested?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
rothfeld,
if
there
is
no
testimonial
component
and
you're
satisfied
that
the
government
would
not
offer
it
for
any
testimonial
purpose,
why
not
give
limited
use
immunity
to
protect
against
any
testimonial
component
that
might
be
thought
to
be
present?
