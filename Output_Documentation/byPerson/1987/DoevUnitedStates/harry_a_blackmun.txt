justice
blackmun
mr.
timbie,
if
the
scene
were
changed,
say,
to
the
state
of
colorado,
would
these
records
be
available?
justice
blackmun
suppose
colorado
passed
a
law
saying
they
passed
a
bank
secrecy
act,
would
it
be
constitutional?
justice
blackmun
so,
it's
foreign
venue
that
really
is
the
sticker
here.
what
was
the...
does
the
record
disclose
any
business
reasons
for
having
accounts
in
the
cayman
islands?
justice
blackmun
if
one
walks
down
the
streets
of
nassau,
which
is
foreign
bank
after
foreign
bank,
and
i
haven't
been
in
the
cayman
islands,
but
i
suppose
it's
the
same
reason,
is...
are
they
there
because
they
are
refugees
for
what,
tainted
money?
justice
blackmun
mr.
timbie,
do
you
have
any
comment
on
the
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
by
rex
lee?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner
is
the
target
of
a
federal
grand
jury
investigation
and
pursuant
to
a
subpoena
he
produced
some
records
but
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
when
he
was
questioned
about
the
existence
or
location
of
additional
records.
there
were
foreign
banks
concerned
and
they
refused
to
comply
with
subpoenas
served
upon
them.
the
government
then
filed
a
motion
for
an
order
directing
the
petitioner
to
sign
a
consent
directive
authorizing
those
banks
to
disclose
records
of
any
and
all
accounts
without
identifying
or
acknowledging
their
existence.
the
district
court
denied
that
motion.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
disagreed
and
it
ordered
that
petitioner
to
execute
the
consent
directive
and
he
refused
and
was
found
to
be
in
civil
contempt,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
the
consent
directive
here
is
not
testimonial
in
nature
and
compelling
the
petitioner
to
sign
it
does
not
violate
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
