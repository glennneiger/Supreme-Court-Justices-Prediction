mr.
timbie,
taking
justice
blackmun's
question
about
a
colorado
bank
one
step
further,
supposing
your
client
had
a
safe
deposit
box
in
the
colorado
bank
and
the
government
wanted
the
key,
could
they
get
it
from
him?
justice
stevens
very
similar
to
this
case.
justice
stevens
but
would
you
set
that
aside?
would
you
set
aside
the
testimonial
significance
of
delivering
the
key?
justice
stevens
whether
they
could
require
him
to
deliver
the
key.
justice
stevens
no,
no.
justice
stevens
without
giving
any
kind
of
immunity.
justice
stevens
they
could
just
subpoena
the
key
and
he'd
have
to
respond
to
the
subpoena
by
delivering
it?
justice
stevens
well,
don't
we
assume
here
the
government
already
knows
about
the
accounts?
justice
stevens
yeah.
okay.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
well,
may
i
ask
another
question
then?
supposing
the
grand
jury
subpoenaed
somebody
and
asked
them
to
provide
them
with
a
handwriting
sample
of
the
person's
signature,
which
i
guess
they
can
do
if
they
are
just
trying
to
compare
it
with
the
pre-existing
signature,
but
are
you
saying
that
they
could
not
take
that
signature
and
go
to
other
parties
and
say,
have
you
ever
seen
a
signature
like
this
one?
justice
stevens
not
only...
they
could
use
it
to
gather
evidence
that
might
incriminate
him.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
take
that
signature
around
and
ask
people,
have
you
seen--
justice
stevens
i'm
not
sure
the
government...
that
it
would
be
all
right
to
do
that.
i
think
they
would
argue
that
that
order
might
not
itself
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
stevens
supposing
that
instead
of
getting
a
court
order,
you'd
lock
him
up
for
long
enough
to
persuade...
the
police
had
locked
him
up
long
enough
to
persuade
him
to
sign
this
document,
didn't
beat
him
up,
but
used
a
course
of
tactics
to
get
him
to
sign
it,
would
that
violate
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
stevens
could
they
do
it?
justice
stevens
why
not?
justice
stevens
why
couldn't
they
do
it?
justice
stevens
on
that
point,
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
supposing
instead
of
the
document
he
was
asked
to
sign,
there
was
a
document
that
said
to
whom
it
may
concern,
if
there
are
any
bank
accounts
controlled
by
mr.
doe
under
your
control,
please
reveal
the
contents
to
them,
you
don't
claim
that
would
be
permissible
or
do
you?
i
mean,
here
you
know
in
advance
which
accounts...
i
guess
there's
a
twelfth
account,
but
assume
you
really
weren't
sure,
you
wanted
a
kind
of
broad
document
like
that
and
then
you
take
it
around
to
all
the
different
banks
in
the
cayman
islands
until
you
found
the
right
one?
could
you
do
that?
justice
stevens
well,
what
about
my
hypothetical?
justice
stevens
you
know
he
has
a
bank
account
in
the
cayman
islands
and
there
are
fourteen
banks
there,
so
you
ask
him
to
sign
a
general
consent
that
would
be
given
authority
to
go
in
any
one
of
the
fourteen.
justice
stevens
well,
his
execution
of
that
document
would
certainly
lead
to
the
discovery
of
evidence
he
couldn't
otherwise
get.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
objection
that
the
man
would
make
in
justice
kennedy's
example,
you
go
get
the
car
yourself,
i
don't
have
to
make...
you
cannot
compel
me
to
help
try
your
lawsuit.
justice
stevens
that's
basically
what
he's
saying,
i
don't
want
to
drive
it
down
for
you.
i
don't
want
to
produce
my
car.
justice
stevens
that's
a
fifth
amendment
kind
of
argument.
justice
stevens
on
the
aunt
question,
i'm
not
sure
it
would
offend.
if
she
had
custody
of
the
vehicle
and
you
subpoenaed
the
vehicle
and
ordered
her
to
produce
it,
i
don't
know
why
that
would
offend
me.
maybe
if
she
has
to
hire
somebody
else
to
do
the
driving,
but
i
think
she'd
have
to
bring
it
into
court.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
you
know,
it's
a
very
interesting
question.
i'm
not
sure
we've
focused
on
it
very
often.
say
the
police
beat
some
prisoner
up
and
force
him
to
give
a
confession,
then
they
never
produce
it
into
evidence,
they
just
put
it
in
the
file
somewhere,
have
they
violated
the
fifth
amendment
or
haven't
they?
no
testimonial
use.
they
made
him
talk
against
himself.
justice
stevens
and
that's
really
a
little
different
than
it
might
be
if
it
were
a
state
case.
the
state
court
might
have
general
jurisdiction
to
do
this
sort
of
thing,
whether
it's
a
defendant
or
not.
but
a
federal
court
has
to
find
a
jurisdictional
basis
and
the
jurisdictional
foundation
here
is
the
all
writs
act.
justice
stevens
and
that's
not
before
us.
justice
stevens
it
may
mean
that
the
federal
court
has
less
authority
in
this
area
than
the
state
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
