justice
kennedy
--well,
i
assume
the
government
could
take
care
of
that
by
simply
redrafting
the
order.
justice
kennedy
well,
we
could
play
around
with
the
words,
i
suppose,
but
it
would
say
without
acknowledging
that
i
have
control,
you
are
authorized
to
release
any
accounts
over
which
i
do
have
control.
justice
kennedy
well,
we
can
argue
about
that.
justice
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
act
of
the
bank.
let
me
ask
you
just
one
other
question.
you've
argued
the
case
so
far
in
order
to
show
that
there's
a
testimonial
component
to
this
statement.
does
your
case
rise
or
fall
on
that?
if
we
were
to
rule
that
there
is
no
testimonial
component,
does
your
case
necessarily
fail?
justice
kennedy
that's
another
way
of
asking
whether
or
not
the
fifth
amendment
has
another
ingredient
and
that
is
that
the
accused
simply
can't
be
asked
to
do
too
much
to
make
the
case
against
him.
justice
kennedy
i
didn't
hear
your
answer.
you
think
there
are?
justice
kennedy
no.
justice
stevens
is
correct,
it
seems
to
me,
in
what
he
suggests
because
this
is
done
all
the
time.
if
it's
a
valid
court
order,
it
can
be
enforced.
if
it's
invalid,
it
can't
be.
justice
kennedy
you're
saying
it's
valid,
so,
we
can
enforce
it.
justice
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
counsel,
and
then
i
hesitate
to
introduce
a
new
hypothetical,
but
suppose
in
the
routine
criminal
misdemeanor
case
involving
a
traffic
offense,
where
the
ownership
of
the
vehicle
is
clearly
established
and
admitted,
and
the
defendant's
custody
of
the
key
is
admitted,
the
court
says
that
tomorrow,
on
the
second
day
of
the
trial,
you
drive
your
car
down
here
so
we
can
inspect
it,
is
that
permissible?
justice
kennedy
have
you
ever
heard
of
an
order
such
as
that?
justice
kennedy
just
stick
with
so
far
as
the
one
i
gave
you.
you
see
nothing
wrong
with
that
and
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
to
say
that
that
is
correct
procedure?
that
there's
no
constitutional
privilege?
justice
kennedy
and
we're
assuming
that
there's
no
issue
of
his
ownership,
there's
no
issue
of
his
possession
of
the
key.
justice
kennedy
would
you
acknowledge
that
orders
such
as
the
one
i
have
hypothesized
are
not
routine
and,
in
fact,
are
almost
unknown
in
our
jurisprudence
in
the
united
states?
justice
kennedy
orders
requiring
the
accused
to
produce
evidence
over
which
he
has
control
where
his
control
and
ownership
is
not
disputed.
justice
kennedy
we
have
also
said
that
the
fifth
amendment
stands
for
the
fact
that
we
have
an
accusatorial
system
and
not
an
inquisitorial
system,
but
you
think
that's
all
dictum
and
there
must
be
a
testimonial
component
to
the
act.
