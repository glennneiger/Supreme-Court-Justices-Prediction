mr.
richard
e.
timbie
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
fifth
amendment
implications
of
a
court
order
requiring
a
grand
jury
target
to
waive
foreign
bank
secrecy
requirements.
the
facts
can
be
stated
simply.
john
doe
is
under
grand
jury
investigation
for
tax
offenses.
the
grand
jury
knows
that
doe
has
bank
accounts
in
the
cayman
islands
and
bermuda
and
believes
that
the
records
of
those
accounts
would
provide
evidence
sufficient
to
bring
an
indictment.
the
grand
jury
has
tried
to
get
those
records
by
serving
subpoenas
on
the
u.s.
branches
of
those
foreign
banks,
but
has
been
unsuccessful
because
the
banks
have
objected
on
the
ground
of
foreign
bank
secrecy
laws
that
prohibit
disclosure
of
bank
information
without
the
consent
of
the
customer.
the
united
states
attorney,
therefore,
filed
this
action
in
the
district
court.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
the--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not
binding,
and,
in
fact,
it
may
not
even
be
pertinent,
but
the
government
feels
that
it
would
be
helpful
in
obtaining
the
records
in
a
show
cause
proceeding
against
the
banks
in
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
yes,
justice
scalia.
that
is
precisely
what
was
done
in
the
bank
of
nova
scotia
case,
and
it
is
what
the
government
acknowledges
in
a
footnote
in
its
brief.
it
proposes
to
do
in
this
case.
it
simply
wants
this
consent
as
a
sort
of
thumb
on
the
scale
in
that
balancing
test
that
will
be
used
in
that
proceeding.
the
district
court
originally
denied
the
government's
motion
for
an
order
requiring
john
doe
to
sign
the
consent
directive,
and
the
u.s.
attorney
appealed
the
denial
to
the
fifth
circuit
which
reversed
and
remanded.
on
remand,
doe
was
ordered
to
sign
the
document
and
refused
to
do
so,
was
held
in
civil
contempt,
and
sanctions
were
stayed
pending
this
appeal.
the
directive
that
doe
has
been
ordered
to
sign
by
the
court
below
makes
four
statements.
it
says
that
doe
directs
any
bank
to
disclose
records
of
accounts
over
which
he
has
signatory
authority.
excuse
me.
over
which
he
has
the
right
of
withdrawal.
that
that
direction
is
irrevocable.
that
that
direction
is
given
pursuant
to
a
court
order,
and
that
that
direction
is
intended
to
constitute
consent
for
purposes
of
bermuda
and
cayman
law.
we
contend
that
that
order
below
violates
doe's
fifth
amendment
rights
because
the
consent
directive,
once
signed,
would
be
a
compelled
communication
and
its
contents
would
be
used
to
incriminate
doe.
now,
the
government
concedes
compulsion
and
incrimination,
and
we
feel
there
is
no
serious
doubt
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
communication.
after
all,
once
signed,
the
document
will
be
a
statement
by
doe
to
the
banks
that
he
directs
them
to
disclose
records,
that
he
won't
revoke
his
direction,
and
that
he
will
not
later
argue
that
it's
not
a
valid
consent.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
mr.
chief
justice,
our
contention
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
test
is
not
whether
the
statement
is
testimonial
in
the
narrow
sense
that
the
government
argues;
that
is,
that
it
gives
the
government
information
that
is
directly
relevant
to
the
case
or
could
be
used
as
leads;
but
the
test
that
this
court
has
used
in
every
case
and
that
is
the
rational
in
every
case
is
whether
the
compelled
statement
is
testimonial
or
communicative
as
opposed
to
a
non-communicative
act
or,
in
the
case
of
a
handwriting
exemplar
or
voice
print,
a
statement
that
isn't
intended
to
be
used
for
its
content
in
any
way.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
i
would
assume
not.
i
simply
don't
know.
i
would
assume
there
would
be
a
supremacy
problem.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
the
record
discloses
that
doe
was
involved
in
international
oil
trading
business.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
mr.
justice
blackmun,
they
are
there
for
all
sorts
of
reasons,
of
course,
but
we
feel
that
the
problem...
there
is
obviously
a
concern
that
the
government
has
in
this
case
that
it
is
unable
under
certain
circumstances
to
obtain
records
of
those
foreign
accounts.
we
feel
that
the
pertinent
issue
here
is
whether
the
means
that
they've
chosen
in
this
case
to
obtain
the
records
offends
the
fifth
amendment.
that
is,
whether
when
they
want
to
obtain
those
records,
they
can
compel
an
unwilling,
unimmunized
defendant
or
accused
to
speak
on
the
government's
behalf
and
then
use
the
content
of
that
speech
to
obtain
the
records.
i
would
point
out
that
there's
no
question
that,
as
justice
scalia
mentioned,
there's
no
question
that
the
government
has
an
alternative
means
of
getting
these
records
that
would
involve
no
fifth
amendment
problem,
which
would
simply
be
a
show
cause
order
against
the
banks
that
have
already
been
served
subpoenas,
and
then
a
contempt
hearing
in
which
the
banks
can
be
made
to
provide
the
records,
unless
they
could
persuade
the
judge
that
the
cayman
islands
interest
in
the
enforcement
of
its
bank
secrecy
laws
outweighs
the
u.s.
interest
in
the
enforcement
of
its
criminal
tax
laws.
and
so
far,
very
few
banks
have
been
able
to
win
that
balance
of
test.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
that's
an
interesting
question.
i
would
argue
that
the
act
of
producing
the
key
might
have
testimonial
aspects--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--in
john
doe,
but
setting
that
aside,
yes,
they
could,
and
they
could
because
they
were
using
a
means--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--oh,
no,
i
certainly
wouldn't,
but
i
thought
you
were
asking
a
more
general
question
as
to--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--they
could
certainly
give
him
acts
of
production
immunity
and
require
delivery.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
or
if
they
knew--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--if
they
knew
to
a
certainty
that
the
key
existed
and
they
had
it,
they
could
make
him
give
it
and
that's
because
he
would
not
be
required
to
communicate
in
any
way
in
order
to
fulfill
the
order
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
unless
he
could
establish
in
a
huffman
hearing
that
the
government
would
be
learning
of
the
existence
of
the
key
or
of
his
possession
of
it
and
that
fact
would
be
incriminating
under
the
fisher
rational.
he
would
have
to
give
it.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
excuse
me,
your
honor.
may
i
clarify
that
answer?
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
the
government
knows
about
eleven
accounts.
it
has
told
the
court
below
that
it
knows
of
a
twelfth
account
that
is
not
in
john
doe's
name,
but
that
it
believes
was
controlled
by
doe
and
used
in
connection
with
these
illegal
activities,
and
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
consent
procedure
is
to
obtain
the
records
of
that
account,
assuming
that
they
are,
in
fact,
controlled
by
doe.
the
government
also
wants
records
of
any
accounts
of
which
it
knows
nothing
that
would
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
consent.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
the
answer
to
your
question
lies
not
in...
i
don't
think
lies
in
the
issue
before
the
court
today,
but
in
the
extent
to
which
the
court
would
extend
fisher
and
how
the
court
views
the
act
of
production
rational,
i
could
argue
that
if
the
government
didn't
know
to
a
certainty
that
he
possessed
any
guns,
and
the
fact
that
he
possessed
any
gun
would
be
incriminating
under
the
circumstances,
that
fisher
should
be
extended
to
that.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
excuse
me.
it
was
in
doe
that
it
was--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--my
reading
of
doe...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
point
that
you're
making.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
we
don't
feel
that
it's
established
by
fisher
and
doe.
we
simply
don't
feel
it's
been
taken
away
by
fisher
and
doe.
we--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--it
existed
in
the
so-called
physical
evidence
cases
in
which,
beginning
with
the
holt
case
back
in
1910,
justice
holmes
announced
a
boundary
to
the
fifth
amendment
in
terms
of
a
requirement
that
the
government
not
compel
a
witness
or
an
accused
to
provide
any
form
of
testimony
or
conduct
that
would
be
testimonial
or
communicative,
and,
in
fact,
justice
holmes'
word
was
"communicative
conduct"
as
opposed
to
a
demonstration
of
physical
characteristics,
and
subsequent
cases,
like
schmerber
and
dionisio,
gilbert
and
wade,
have
all
applied
that
line
and,
in
fact,
have
described
protected
conduct
as
conduct
that
is
testimonial
or
communicative
in
any
way.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
right.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
the
line
i'm
drawing--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--is
that
he
cannot
be
made
to
speak
such
that
the
government
would
use
the
content
of
his
speech
to
obtain
incriminating
evidence
unless
that
compelled
speech
is,
in
fact,
immunized.
that
is
the
line,
and--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--the
key
hypothetical
is
an
extraordinary
one.
i
should
think
that
the
genuine
analogy
in
this
case
would
be
to
sign
a
directive
instructing
anyone,
if
they
have
custody
of
the
key
that
will
allow
access
to
incriminating
evidence,
to
turn
it
over
to
the
u.s.
attorney
and
if
the
government
feels
that
it
could
use
that
document
somehow
to
cause
a
third
party
to
release
the
key
to--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--well,
no,
not
to
use
at
a
trial,
but
if
there's
a
potential
for
using
it
at
trial,
obviously
that's
an
independent
basis
for
finding
fifth
amendment
violations.
if
i
may,
there
has
not
been
a
case,
and
we
don't
contend
there's
been
a
case,
in
which
this
court
has
directly
addressed
a
communication
that
was
not
testimonial
in
the
sense
that
the
government
asserts.
we
acknowledge
that.
on
the
other
side,
there
has
never
been
a
case
in
which
this
court
has
drawn
the
line
that
the
government
suggests
and
that
line
has
somehow
been
relative
to
the
holding.
that
is,
there
is
no
case
in
which
this
court
has
allowed
a
compelled
communication
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
communicate
facts
about
an
offense
or
disclose
information
that
might
lead
directly
or
indirectly--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--oh,
absolutely.
there's
no
question
they
could
do
that.
the
reason
they
could
do
that
is
set
forth
in
gilbert.
the
reason
they
could
do
that
is
that
it
is
the
physical
characteristics
of
the
signature
and
not
the
content
of
the
words
that
they're
after.
therefore,
there's
no
fifth
amendment
issue.
they
can
use
it
against
him
in
any
way
they
choose.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
that's
what
gilbert...
that's
what
schmerber
says,
certainly.
schmerber
says
that
although
the
logic
of
the
underlying
principles
of
the
fifth
amendment
would
suggest
that
you
can't
even
compel
assistance
from
a
defendant
in
the
form
of
turning
over
physical
evidence,
this
court
declines
to
extend
the
fifth
amendment
beyond
testimony
or
communication,
and,
therefore,
in
gilbert,
the
court
said
the
handwriting
exemplar
could
be
compelled
specifically
because
it
was
not
the
content,
it
was
not
any
form
of
testimony
or
communication
out
of
the
defendant's
mouth
that
was
the
purpose
or
use
of
the
exemplar.
and,
in
fact,
i
would
certainly
argue
that
if,
in
the
guise
of
taking
a
handwriting
exemplar,
the
government
were
to
make
joe
write
out
a
document,
write
these
words,
i
consent
to
disclosure
of
my
foreign
bank
records,
and
they
were
then
to
take
that
handwriting
exemplar
to
the
bank
and
attempt
to
pass
it
off
as
a
consent,
i
would
certainly
argue
that
it
would
be
a
communication.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
there
are
two
uses
and,
in
fact,
there
are
principal
and
alternative
arguments
in
the
case.
the
first
use
is
taking
the
form
to
the
bank
and
presenting
it
to
the
bank
as
a
communication
of
doe's
consent
and
an
assurance
from
doe
that
he
won't
revoke
that
consent
and
won't
later
argue
that
it
was
invalidly
granted.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
in
the
words
of
schmerber,
blood
and
handwriting
samples
are
sought
for
their
physical
characteristics,
not
for
any
compelled
communication
they
might
entail,
whereas
that
is
sought
for
a
compelled
communication,
and
i
recognize
that
there's
no
direct
authority
that
can
be
cited
that
would
cause
the
court
to
choose
between
the
government's
line
and
our
line,
but
i
would--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--surely.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
justice
scalia,
i
would
submit,
respectfully,
that
if
this
court
were
to
fall
back
on
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment,
it
would
have
to
overrule
a
great
deal
of
precedent
in
addition
to
not
following--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--because
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
suggests
that
what
we're
concerned
about
here
is
compelled
confessions,
and
the
reason...
the
initial
reason
that
compelled-confessions
were
considered
inappropriate
was
that
they're
untrustworthy
and
unseemingly.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
well,
and
then
the
court
has
then
gone
on
to
say
that
under
kastigar,
the
fifth
amendment
would
require
that
in
addition,
any
leads
that
came
out
of
the
testimony
would
have
to
be
protected
and
any
evidence
derived
directly
or
indirectly
from
it.
perhaps
i
could
come
at
your
question
from
the
other
direction.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
i
can't
argue
that
there
is
a
compelling
logical
reason
why
the
line
has
to
be
drawn
where
we
suggest.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
come
at
the
answer
to
your
argument
from
the
other
direction
and
suggest
some
types
of
compelled
communication
that
would
apparently
be
allowable
under
the
government's
rule
that
i
feel
would
not
be
within
the
spirit
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
certainly
would
not
be
within
the
traditional
scope
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
it
has
been
applied
over
the
last
hundreds
of
years.
let
me
take,
if
i
may,
the
government's
own
rational
for
why,
in
their
words,
the
document
doe
is
being
asked
to
sign
is
a
non-assertive
document
and,
therefore,
the
government
would
divide
the
universe
of
communications,
of
course,
into
assertive
communications
that
continue
to
be
protected
and
so-called
non-assertive
communications
that
aren't
protected,
and
the
rational
for
putting
this
consent
directive
in
the
non-assertive
title
under
the
government's
view,
there
are
three
of
them
offered.
one
is
that
it
is
an
imperative
statement
issued
to
a
third
party
and
should
be
simply
treated
as
a
verbal
act.
now,
the
corollary
it
seems
to
me
of
that
rational
is
that
any
imperative
statement
is
outside
the
fifth
amendment,
so
long
as
the
government
is
not
using
it
as
an
admission
of
fact.
does
that
mean
that
in
a
bank
robbery
investigation,
the
government
could
get
a
court
order
that
the
first
suspect
arrested
call
up
or
write
to
an
alleged
accomplice
and
tell
him,
bring
the
loot
to
the
corner
of
fifth
and
main,
we'll
go
some
place
and
divide
it
up
and
then
wait
and
see
what
happens?
i
would
contend
that
that
is
not
faithful
to
the
command
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
policy
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
the
government
will
shoulder
the
entire
load
in
an
investigation
and
not--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--there
may
well
be
an
overlap
between
due
process--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--pardon
me,
ma'am.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
i
am
very
sorry.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
i
said,
in
our
view,
the
mere
presentation
of
the
document
to
the
bank
is
a
testimonial
use
because
it's
a
use
of
content.
in
the
alternative,
if
the
government...
if
the
court
adopts
the
government's
view
that
this
is...
that
there
is
a
difference
between
assertive
and
non-assertive
communications
then
i
think
it
would
still
be
a
testimonial
use
and
it
is
the
use
identified
in
ranauro
which,
in
the
first
circuit's
decision
in
ranauro,
which
held
this
procedure
to
be
unconstitutional,
ranauro
presented
a
hypothetical
that
framed
the
issue
in
which
a
consent
directive
was
signed
and
presented
to
a
foreign
bank
and
the
bank
produced
records
of
an
account
that
wasn't
in
the
name
of
the
person
who
signed
the
consent
directive,
and
it
seems
clear
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
statement
in
the
consent,
i
authorize
disclosure
of
records
of
accounts
over
which
i
have
the
right
of
withdrawal,
becomes
testimonial
evidence
that
he
has
the
right
of
withdrawal,
and
it
would
be
evidence
that
could
be
used
in
a
criminal
trial
against
him
unless
he
were
given
immunity
from
the
act
of
signing
the
document.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
i
am
not
sure
how
that
would
be
possible.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
no.
i
believe
the
document
was
redrafted
once
in
order
to
do
exactly
what
you're
suggesting.
that
is,
make
it
at
the
time
it
is
signed
not
an
acknowledgement
of
control
of
ready
accounts,
but
what
the
ranauro
court
said
is
that
no
matter
how
hypothetically
it's
drafted
and
vaguely
it's
drafted,
the
process
server
who
went
to
the
bank
could
then
get
on
the
stand,...
the
brown
decision
in
the
second
circuit
says
that
you
can
authenticate
and
get
admission
of
records
by
putting
on
the
process
server
who
served
the
subpoena
and
say
this
is
what
i
asked
for
and
here's
what
i
got,
and
that's
authentication.
in
this
case,
the
process
server
could
say
or
the
government
attorney
or
an
agent
who
delivered
the
consent
could
say,
i
went
to
the
bank
and
demanded
the
records,
they
said
no
because
the
customer
has
to
consent.
i
went
to
the
bank
with
doe's
consent,
this
is
what
they
gave
me.
i'm
not
sure
that
would
be
adequate
to
authenticate
the
records,
but
it
would
be
some
evidence
of
a
link
between
doe
and
those
accounts,
and
the
government
explicitly
refuses
or
at
least
does
not
deny
that
that
document
would
be
usable
in
a
trial
for
that
purpose.
their
argument
at
the
end
of
their
brief
on
the
last
page
simply--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--says
it
wouldn't
have
probative
value.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
that
is--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--i
would
have
to
say
that
in
our
view,
the
traditional
fifth
amendment
rule
is
that
too
much
and
communication
are
the
same
thing,
that
the
court
has
said
too
much
in
terms
of
production
of
physical
evidence,
giving
blood
samples,
being
forced
to
speak
in
your
own
voice
in
a
line-up
and
repeat
what
was
said,
that's
a
lot.
but
the
bright
line
the
court
has
drawn
in
case
after
case
is,
between
physical
evidence,
acts
that
have
no
communicative
content,
and
communication,
and
i
think
that
in
my
view,
too
much
and
that
line
are
the
same
thing.
having
already
given
the
hypothetical...
excuse
me.
i
only
ended
up
giving
one
of
the
explanations
that
the
government
uses
to
show
that
this
is
a
non-assertive
two
others
that
suggest
two
other
categories
of
communications
that
it
would
view
as
unprotected.
one
is
the
government
argues
in
its
brief
that
this
is
a
non-assertive
communication
because
the
government
put
the
words
in
doe's
mouth,
and
the
court
ordered
him
to
say
it,
and,
therefore,
it
wouldn't
be
right
to
treat
them
as
words
of
doe
or
as
communications
from
doe.
now,
the
government
is
clearly
trying
to
have
it
both
ways
there.
it
wants
to
take
this
document
to
the
bank
and
say
to
the
bank,
this
is
doe's
consent,
only
he
can
give
it,
there's
his
signature.
on
the
other
hand,
it
comes
to
this
court
and
says,
you
should
treat
it
as
an
act
devoid
of
content
because
we
told
him
what
to
say.
if
the
government's
right
there,
then
presumably
unimmunized
witnesses
could
be
made
to
cooperate
in
an
investigation
so
long
as
the
government
told
them
what
to
say.
for
example,
if
you
imagine
a
complex
conspiracy
investigation
in
which,
as
is
often
true,
the
prosecutor
knows
what
went
on
and
knows
who
the
players
were,
but
can't
because
it
doesn't
have
a
cooperating
witnesses
establish
these
conspiratorial
links
that
are
necessary
for
the
conspiracy
indictment,
it
would
theoretically
under
the
government's
view
be
proper
to
have
a
court
order
an
unimmunized
alleged
coconspirator
to
call
up
other
parties
and
make
statements
calculated
to
cause
t
other
parties
to
incriminate
themselves
and
if
that
were
to
work,
then
the
incriminating
statements
might
equally
well
incriminate
the
person
doing
the
calling
out
of
his
own
mouth.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
that's
correct,
and
then
they
would
order
that
the
defendants
in
the
ultimate
indictment
would
have
to
come
up
with
some
trickery
rational
to
preclude
it.
my
point
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
is
making
him
convict
himself
out
of
his
own
mouth
and
if
it's
a
question
of
what
is
too
much,
that
that
should
be
too
much.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
you're
suggesting
there's
a
jurisdiction
problem?
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
if
you're
suggesting
that
there
would
be
a
jurisdiction
problem
in
a
district
court
issuing
such
an
order,
i
would
agree
and
we
made
that
argument
below
and
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
there
was
jurisdiction
for
this
prosecutor
or
john
doe
to
assist
the
government
in
its
investigation
in
that
way,
even
though
the
controversy
was
between
the
banks
and
the
government.
if
you're
suggesting
that
setting
aside
jurisdiction,
there's
some
per
se
rule
why
that
is
improper,
i
don't
know
what
the
rule
is.
i
think
in
order
to
police
that
kind
of
conduct,
you
need
a
fifth
amendment
rule
that
encompasses
all
communications.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
my
only
comment
is,
as
i
said
earlier
in
the
argument,
the
issue...
there's
a
sham
quality
to
what's
going
on
here,
and
i
think
that
that
is
pointed
out
in
the
amicus
brief.
the
cayman
islands
have
ruled,
the
high
court
of
the
cayman
islands
has
ruled
that
a
compelled
consent
is
not
a
consent
for
purposes
of
its
law.
so,
what
the
government
is
trying
to
obtain
is
on
its
face
an
invalid
document,
and
the
government
has
said
we
want
to
use
that
document
nonetheless
in
a
u.s.
court
in
the
balancing
test
in
hopes
that
it
will
be
thrown
on
our
side
of
the
scale,
notwithstanding
its
patent
invalidity
in
the
cayman
islands.
i
don't
think
the
issue
of
it
is
a
valid
document
is
determinative
of
the
fifth
amendment
question
in
this
case,
and
i
believe
what
the
cayman
islands
were
saying
is
that
that's
an
issue
that
ought
not
be
addressed
in
this
proceeding
because
it
hasn't
been
framed
in
the
record
below.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
rothfeld
took
issue
with
our
waiver
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
hypothetical,
saying
that,
of
course,
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
self-policing
because
any
lawyer
in
his
right
mind
isn't
going
to
accept
the
compelled
consent
directive
as
a
valid
waiver.
but
the
government
offers
a
broader
rational
here,
even
in
the
waiver
area.
what
it
is
saying
there
is
that
it
can
force
an
unwilling,
unimmunized
witness
to
sign
any
waiver
that
would
merely
be...
would
allow
it
to
overcome
a
non-constitutional
impediment
to
access
the
third
party
records.
there
are
other
statutory
privileges
that
this
procedure
could
be
used
for
that
would
not
give
rise
to
self-policing
mechanisms
through--
mr.
richard
e.
timbie
--i
wholeheartedly
agree,
but
what
the
government
is
saying
in
this
case
is
that
you
shouldn't
look
at
this
through
a
fifth
amendment
lens
because
it
will
be
policed
elsewhere.
what
we're
saying
is
the
government
shouldn't
be
able
to
give
it
a
try
by
forcing
you
to
sign
that
document.
think
of,
for
example,
a
state
evidentiary
privilege.
the
accountant-client
privilege.
spousal
privilege,
for
example.
it
may
well
be
the
government
could
get
a
consent
directive,
get
a
spouse
or
accountant
to
go
into
a
grand
jury
and
talk
to
the
police,
never
introduce
the
testimony
in
evidence,
so
there
would
never
be
a
suppression
hearing,
but
use
the
fruits.
we
contend
that
the
only
way
to
police
that
is
with
the
fifth
amendment,
not
with
some
fourth
amendment
notion.
getting
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
she
asked
the
government
whether
they
felt
they
could
use
this
document
in
evidence,
and
the
government
said
yes.
no
fifth
amendment
problem,
and
we
don't...
but
we
wouldn't
try.
we
state
that
that
is
constructive
use
immunity
which
is
not
allowed
in
this
court.
