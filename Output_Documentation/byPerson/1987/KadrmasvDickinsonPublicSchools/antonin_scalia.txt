you
would
not
urge,
if
that's
all
that's
left,
though,
you
wouldn't
urge
any
heightened
scrutiny
on
the
requirement
to
pay
a
bus
fare,
as
you
do
of
the
ability
to
go
to
school?
justice
scalia
it's
ordinary
protection
analysis?
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
this
is
just
the
right
to
money,
isn't
it?
she
doesn't
want
to
pay
money
for
the
bus
ride;
other
people
don't
have
to
pay;
she
has
to
pay.
what
are
we
talking
about
except
money?
justice
scalia
you
are
saying,
i
think,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
that
it
once
had
a
purpose,
to
achieve
reorganization.
it
really
doesn't
have
any
purpose
any
more
except,
i
suppose,
if
you
know
that
the
incentives
that
the
government
promises
one
time,
everybody
else
will
get
anyway;
the
next
time
they
offer
an
incentive
you
won't
believe
in
it.
you're
saying
the
only
current
reason
for
the
distinction
is
that
if
the
government
should
now
say
that
everybody
will
get
bus
transportation
free,
people
will
say,
"gee,
you
can't
rely
on
the
government.
"
"we
thought
that
one
of
the
incentives
for
reorganizing
was
that
we'd
get
bus
transportation;
but
now
they've
given
it
to
everybody
anyway
so
you
simply
can't
trust
the
government
when
it
promises
things.
"
"that's
the
only
current
existing
reason
for
the
distinction.
"
justice
scalia
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
legislature
had
no
intention
whatever
to
benefit
people
distant
from
the
schools;
it
just
wanted
to
eliminate
a
possible
obstacle
to
their
voting
for
reorganization?
justice
scalia
it
has
no
beneficent
desire
here
at
all?
it
was
just
wanted
to
get
their
votes?
justice
scalia
i
don't
want
to
pay
even
if
i'm
rich.
that's
how
i
got
rich.
i
don't
spend
money
that
i
don't
have
to
spend,
and
why
should
i
have
to
pay
for
busses
when
rich
people
in
other
counties
don't?
so
isn't
there
still
an
equal
protection
argument?
justice
scalia
i
assume
that
in
the
reorganized
districts
where
they
don't
make
a
charge
for
the
bussing
fee,
it
comes
out
of
locally
imposed
taxes?
justice
scalia
so
that
the
people
who
don't
pay
bussing
fare
have
to
pay
something
more
in
their
taxes,
although
it
probably
wouldn't--
justice
scalia
--nice
pun.
i
like
that.
0
[laughter.]
justice
scalia
i
suppose
that
reorganized
districts
have
got
a
better
tax
base,
so
an
enhanced
tax
base--
justice
scalia
i
suppose
you
can
say
that
the
person
who
can't
afford
the
1/3
fee
or
whatever
proportion
of
that
is
charged,
has
to
forego
the
other
66
percent
just
because
that
person
doesn't
have
the
money,
but
another
resident
of
the
district
who
has
no
children
forgoes
the
whole
thing,
all
the
time.
so
one
doesn't
have
the
money;
the
other
doesn't
have
children.
it
isn't
the
case
that
everybody
in
the
district
has
to
get
the
benefit.
