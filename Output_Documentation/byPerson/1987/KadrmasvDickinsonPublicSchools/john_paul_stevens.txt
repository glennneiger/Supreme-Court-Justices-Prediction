justice
stevens
that
doesn't
take
care
of
the
entire
problem.
you're
not
saying
it
takes
care
of
the
entire...
you
still
have
an
equal
protection
problem
that
people
in
some
counties
have
to
pay
for
the
busses,
you
know,--
justice
stevens
--up
to
the
point
where
you're
below
the
absolute
poverty
line
that
you
can't
possibly
get
to
school.
you'd
still
be
disadvantaged
as
regards
everybody
else
in
the
state.
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
justice
o'connor
was
asking
you
to
concede
or
to
asking
your
position
as
to
whether
your
clients
qualify
under
this
statute
if
it's
interpreted
the
way
your
opponents
say
it
should
be.
you're
not
sure
they
would
qualify
under
it,
are
you?
justice
stevens
you
are?
justice
stevens
then
you're
right,
the
case
is
gone
if
that
statute's
interpreted,
though.
justice
stevens
this
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
inability
to
pay,
does
it?
it
says,
"nonpayment
of
fees".
is
that
what...
are
we
talking
about
the
statutes
quote
on
page
29?
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
inability
to
pay.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
bussing.
it
says,
"rights
are
#"
if
it
means
you
shall
not
be
denied
the
right
to
get
on
the
bus
because
you
don't
pay
the
fees,
if
you
read
it
that
way,
why
hasn't
she
been
riding
the
bus
all
these
years?
justice
stevens
seems
to
me
that's
rather
strange.
i
assume
there's
no
way
to
read
this
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
remove
the
liability
for
the
fees.
all
it
means
is
you
have
to
get
this
particular
student
to
school,
or
i
presume
her
parents
would
continue
to
be
liable
for
the
fees
which
the
school
could
try
to
collect
from
them,
or
the
state
could
if
and
when
the
state
had
sufficient
funds.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
clear
up
one
other
thing
in
my
mind:
they
have
said
that
they
won't
let
her
ride
on
the
bus
not
only
because
she
doesn't
pay
the
money,
but
she
has
to
sign
this
contract?
justice
stevens
so
that
this
statute
wouldn't
cure
that.
she's
got
to...
and
that
contract
required
her
to
waive
the
kind
of
claim
she
asserts
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
mr.
dynes,
what
about...
it
might
have
been
more
economical,
but
what
about
the
contractual
requirement?
they
did
have
to
sign
this
contract,
in
order
to
get
the
child
on
the
bus?
justice
stevens
but
the
contract,
let
me
just
go
back
to
the
contract
that
would
have
required
them,
would
have
prohibited
them
from
bringing
an
action
in
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
reason
for
that?
justice
stevens
why
do
you
have
such
a
contractual
provision?
it
seems
sort
of
a
strange
thing
to
me?
justice
stevens
well,
that
would
explain
my--
justice
stevens
--what
about...
what
is
the
reason
for
the
waiver
of
the
right
to
challenge
the
fee?
justice
stevens
yes.
that's
what
puzzles
me.
one
of
the
things
that
puzzles
me
about
the
case.
justice
stevens
no,
as
i
understand
it...
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me;
the
contract
would
have
foreclosed
a
lawsuit
like
this...
at
least
some
of
the
claims.
justice
stevens
and
that
they
could
not
contest
that
fact?
justice
stevens
mr.
dynes,
before
you
sit
down,
please
follow
up
on
justice
kennedy's
question.
he
asked
you
about
the
rational
basis,
or
the
reason
for
the
distinction
was,
and
you
gave
a
reason
which
was
quite
different
from
the
reason
that
your
state
supreme
court
gave.
they
said
that
the
purpose
was
to
encourage
non-reorganized
districts
to
reorganize.
that
was
the
only
purpose
they
gave.
during
your
argument
you've
said
that's
just
not
going
to
happen.
justice
stevens
i'm
reading
on
page
64
of
the
appendix
which
after
explaining
at
some
length
why
it's
a
rational
basis
standard,
they
say,
"the
obvious
purpose
of
the
legislation
is
to
encourage
school
district
reorganization
with
a
concomitant
tax
base
expansion
and
enhanced
and
more
effective
school
system.
"
"the
legislation
provides
incentive
for
people
to
approve
school
district
reorganization.
"
that's
what
they
say.
justice
stevens
where
do
they
describe
that
in
the
opinion
from
the
part
i've
read?
justice
stevens
well,
i
didn't
find
it.
justice
stevens
general
spaeth,
the
option,
if
i
understand
you,
at
the
time
of
the
legislation,
they
were
concerned
about
poor
families
living
a
long
ways
from
the
new
central
school,
and
what
would
happen
to
them
if
they
didn't
provide
bus
service?
justice
stevens
well,
at
least
those
who
are
a
distance
away.
and
now
you
say
that
some
reorganized
and
some
didn't,
but
those
that
didn't
reorganize
are
functionally
just
like
those
that...
the
problem
that
the
legislature
was
concerned
with...
some
distant
families
not
near
enough
to
the
school
to
get
there
without
free
bus
transportation.
so
now
how
do
you
say
under
your...
why
should
one
family
in
that
posture
which
has
the
same
economic
situation,
same
distance
from
school,
why
wouldn't
the
legislature
express
the
same
concern
about
that
family
as
about
those
that
were
motivated
to...
who
got
into
the
plight
just
because
they
agreed
to
the
reorganization?
that's
the
problem.
justice
stevens
no.
i'm
focusing
on
what
the
legislature
was
concerned
about
when
it
said,
if
you
get
yourself
in
this
particular
structure
with
a
central
school
and
people
living
a
long
ways
away
from
it,
we'll
take
care
of
you.
but
we
won't
take
care
of
a
similar
set
of
circumstances
in
another
district.
what's
the
justification
for
that?
justice
stevens
general,
may
i
interrupt?
you
do
have
these
distinctions
in
life.
sometimes
a
child
moves
into
a
neighborhood
and
everybody
in
the
neighborhood
is
a
swede
and
the
child
is
irish
and
he
gets
beat
up
on
the
way
to
school;
and
in
every
school
district
except
yours,
the
school
authorities
say
we're
going
to
protect
the
children
as
they
go
to
school.
but
in
this
district
the
administration
is
swedish
and
they
say,
"go
ahead
and
beat
the
kid
up
on
the
way
to
school.
"
he
gets
there
though.
he
still
doesn't
have
a
challenge
since
he
can
overcome
the
obstacles
and
he
gets
there?
you
can
tell
justice
stevens
is
from
chicago.

[mirth.]
justice
stevens
well,
we've
got
an
obstacle.
it's
an
obstacle.
justice
stevens
and
the
justification
would
be
the
state
says
each
school
district
runs
its
own
affairs,
except
that
in
9
out
of
10
we
have
regulations
that
ensure
that
the
children
have
adequate
access
to
the
school.
but
in
this
one,
we'll
let
them
run
their
own
show.
and
they
just
happened
to
do
it
in
this
way.
would
that
be
permissible
geographic
discrimination?
justice
stevens
then
it
seems
to
me
there
the
principal;
it's
not
so
much
then
the
county
itself
deciding
how
to
disperse
the
local
taxpayers'
money,
but
you
have
the
state
financing
it.
that
seems
to
me
more
of
a
reason
to
have
a
uniform
rule.
justice
stevens
but
did
free
bussing
exist
before?
