justice
white
as
i
understand
your
argument,
though,
if
north
dakota
didn't
furnish
bus
transportation
to
anyone
in
order
to
get
to
school,
you
would
say
that
that...
practice
was
unconstitutional
as
with
respect
to
poor
people?
justice
white
your
argument
here,
that's
your
principal
argument.
justice
white
your
principal
argument
is
about
poor
people.
justice
white
i
suppose
your
equal
protection
argument
would
be
just
as
good
with
respect
to
the
difference
between
reorganized
and
non-reorganized
districts...
if
there
weren't
any
poor
people,
i
suppose
somebody
who
could
afford
to
drive
their
child
to
school
could
make
it
just
as
good
an
equal
protection
claim
as
you
could
with
respect
to
the
difference
between
the
districts.
justice
white
that
may
be
so,
but
if
we
rely
on
that,
then
we
would
have
to
be
saying
that
north
dakota
is
constitutionally
required
to
furnish
bus
transportation
to
poor
people,
who
have
no
way
for
their
children
to
get
to
school.
justice
white
i
think
it
is,
too.
justice
white
this
was
a
local
option?
justice
white
all
of
these
systems
that
are
local
option
on
bussing?
justice
white
the
reason
that
fees
are
not
charged
for
bussing
in
the
reorganized
districts
is
that
those
reorganization
plans
provided
for
free
bussing?
justice
white
a
reorganized
district
might
possibly
not
charge
a
fee
at
all?
justice
white
they
could
have
a
transportation
plan
that
says
$1.00
a
mile.
justice
white
so
in
effect,
all
the
reorganized
districts
have
opted
themselves
to
provide
free
transportation?
justice
white
also
their
transportation
plans
really
differ
one
from
another?
justice
white
they
don't
charge
but
their
mileages
are
different
or
things
like
that--
--mr.
dyne
do
you
know--
justice
white
--but
counsel,
if
their
cattle
works
out,
for
example,
and
they
make
a
lot
of
money,
they're
going
to
have
to
pay
that
fee.
justice
white
so
as
long
as
they're
poor,
they
don't
pay?
justice
white
--and
if
an
unreorganized
district,
probably
because
if
it
can't
be
reorganized
isn't
going
to
achieve
a
better
tax
base.
so
it's
just
economically
in
a
different
situation?
justice
white
well,
the
supreme
court
said...
indicated
that
right?
