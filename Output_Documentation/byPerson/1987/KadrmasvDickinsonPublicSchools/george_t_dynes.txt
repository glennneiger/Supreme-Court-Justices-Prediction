mr.
george
t.
dynes
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
some
more
facts
might
be
illuminating.
this
matter
of
charging
a
fee
actually,
although
it
is
a
state
law,
did
originate
in
dickinson
back
in
1973
and
it
was
a
plebicite
of
the
bus
uses
that
it
came
about.
prior
to
that
it
was
a
practice
of
picking
up
the
children
at
the
main
road
which
could
mean
a
half-mile
or
a
mile
or
a
quarter
of
a
mile;
and
the
bus
patrons
said
we
would
rather
pay
a...
that
didn't
cost
anything.
they
said
we'd
rather
pay
a
fee
if
you'll
come
to
our
yard
and
pick
up
the
children
and
return
them
there
in
the
afternoon.
so
that
is
what
happened
and
that's
what
is
still
going
on.
subsequent
to
that,
actually,
the
law
was
passed
in
1979.
the
fee
at
the
present
level
and
for
the
past
several
years
as
in
the
case
of
serita
kadrmas
was
$97.00
for
the
full
year.
she's
sixteen
miles
from
school,
so
if
you
figure
in
and
out
each
day,
that
comes
to
1.7
cents
per
mile,
far
less
than
anybody
could
afford
their
own
children.
and
as
the
evidence
showed,
that
the
kadrmases,
by
their
own
testimony
during
the
1984-85
year...
'85-86
year,
excuse
me,
which
was
the
year
that
this
case
was
tried
in
trial
court,
that
they
spent
$114
each
month
for
actual
expenses,
and
this
was
gas
and
similar
expenses
to
haul
the
child
back
and
forth,
versus
the
fee
which
would
have
been
$10.70
a
month.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
that
proves
that,
although
it
may
have
been
an
imposition,
they
were
able
to
get
that
child
to
school
and
clearly
could
have
paid
the
fee
which
was--
mr.
george
t.
dynes
--i
think
it
does,
yes.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
i
think
it
would
have
been
prudent
to
pay
the
fee.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
of
course,
with
a
family
they
are,
they
certainly
aren't
at
a
high
level
of
income,
but
they
did
have
resources
to
devote
to
various
things,
and
it
would
appear
that
that's
something
they
should
have
done.
i
understand
they're
doing
that
now.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
pardon
me?
mr.
george
t.
dynes
no,
it
was
certainly
limited.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
no,
not
at
all.
and
i'm
sure
that
there
wasn't
enough
at
the
end
of
the
month,
which
was
true
for
the
good
share
of
the
people
that
ride
that
bus.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
pardon,
justice
marshall?
mr.
george
t.
dynes
well,
the
testimony...
they
testified
as
to
what
their
income
was,
and
it
was
$15,000.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
no,
no.
that's
the
only
testimony,
and
that
is
the
finding
of
the
court.
the
poverty
level
at
that
time
was
$12,500.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
that's
true,
they
were
asked
to
sign
a
contract.
however,
they
weren't
asked
to
pay
the
fee
if
they
weren't
able
to
pay
the
fee
in
advance.
they
were
able
to
pay
the
fee
when
they
could,
and
mrs.
kadrmas
testified
that
she
understood
that
to
be
the
policy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
for
the
previous
year--
mr.
george
t.
dynes
--i
guess
it
would
have,
yes.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
i
guess
not,
they
could
still
bring
the
equal
protection
on
the
argument
between
the
districts;
and
i
think
they
could
still...
i
don't
know
if
it
would
prevent
them
from
bringing
the
action;
but
of
course
they
would
have
committed
to
pay
the
fee.
they
couldn't
have
contested
the
legality
of
the
fee,
that's
correct.
but
i'm
not
sure
if
they'd
still
have
a
lawsuit
or
not.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
it's
a
matter
of
lining
up
during
the
summer
season
to
know
who's
going
to
ride
the
bus.
they
have...
these
are
district-owned
busses;
they
try
to
fill
them
to
capacity;
they
don't
want
to
have
any
empty
seats
in
them;
they
have
kindergarten
children
who
just
ride
one
way;
they
have
some
others
who
just
ride
one
way
because
they
want
to
stay
after
school
for
extra-curricular
and
things
like
that,
so
they
do
the
best--
mr.
george
t.
dynes
--they
do
the
best
the
can
to
schedule.
and
of
course,
they
do
want
a
legal
commitment.
they
do
want
the
people
to
pay
if
they're
able
to.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
what
is
the
reason
for
the
waiver?
mr.
george
t.
dynes
you're
speaking
about
the
statutory
waiver?
mr.
george
t.
dynes
well,
they
would
have
agreed
that
they
were
obligated
to
pay
the
fee.
there's
no
question
that
that's
true.
there
would
be
a
legal
obligation.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
i
don'
know
that
it
said
that
in
there.
it
didn't
go
into
the
legal
matter.
it
wasn't
drawn
up
by
a
lawyer;
it
was
just
a
contract
that
was
drawn
up
by
the
bus
administrator
asking
people
to
agree
to
pay
a
certain
fee,
and
it's
i
think
probably
was
somewhat
of
an
outgrowth
of
this
case
in
bismark
where
mr.
houdek
mentioned
there
was
a
suit
and
the
case
was
denied
on
a
constitution
attack
because
the
individual
had
signed
the
contract.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
yes.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
i
think
we
have
to
take
that
in
two
parts,
justice
o'connor.
the
reorganized
school
districts
started
reorganizing
under
laws
that
were
passed
in
1947,
and
that
process
basically
has
been
completed.
it
could
still
continue.
but
pretty
much
all
the
little
ones
have
become
bigger
ones
now.
and
under
that
law,
it
did
say
that
each
district,
when
they
reorganized,
has
to
have
a
plan.
now
it's
not
the
same
plan.
they
create
their
own
plan
which
they
vote
on.
then
the
electors
in
each
small
district
being
reorganized
into
the
larger
district
would
have
to
approve
that
plan
in
order
for
the
reorganization
to
be
completed.
and
that
is
what
the
supreme
court
was
referring
to
when
they
said
the
rational
basis
was
to
encourage
reorganization
in
the
larger
districts.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
that's
right.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
that
as
the
reorganization
has
been
completed,
the
plans
are
in
place;
they've
been
voted
on
in
the
individual
districts
and
the
legislature
when
they
passed
this
fee
statute,
simply
left
those
districts
alone
because
they
had
those
plans
in
place,
with
not
charging
any
fees.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
the
first
purpose
was
to
reorganize,
which
they
did.
they
have
a
plan
in
which
they're
honoring;
they're
not
disturbing
that
plan.
the
other
districts,
like
dickinson,
never
had
any...
they
weren't
reorganized;
never
have
been--
mr.
george
t.
dynes
--and
never
will
be.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
they
were
never
required
to
have
any
bus
system,
you
see.
the
statute
now
and
for
many
years
past,
has
said
that
a
school
like
dickinson
need
not
have
a
bus
system
at
all.
but
they
can
elect
to
do
it
simply
by
action
of
the
board,
as
opposed
to,
in
the
reorganized
districts,
where
it
was
an
action
of
the
people,
and
it
was
part
of
the
plan.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
local
option...
and
those
plans,
you
have
to
remember,
were
different,
and
are
different.
it's
been
suggested
that
they
have
free
bus
transportation;
well,
it's
true
they
don't
charge
a
fee,
but
they
don't
haul
all
of
the
children
either.
they
typically
won't
haul
any
children
that
are
within
two
miles
of
school,
for
instance,
and
they
very
often
don't
go
door
to
door
like
we
do
in
dickinson.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
that's
true.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
they
are
left
a
local
option
and
the
statutes
are
completely
silent
on
whether
or
not
they
could
charge
a
fee.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
well
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
you
have
to
have
a
reorganization
transportation
plan.
and
the
statutes
are
silent
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
charge
a
fee.
i
think
they
may
very
well
be.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
well,
in
a
way,
except
that
the
reorganized
districts
are
done
by
vote
of
the
people
at
the
time
the
districts
was
organized,
the
unorganized
districts--
mr.
george
t.
dynes
--the
statute
is
silent
on
that.
i
don't
remember
that
that
was
in
the
decision.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor;
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
they
don't,
and
nobody
wants
to
in
those
districts,
and
i
think
the
reason
is
because
they
have
this
plan
in
place.
but
the
other
districts
either
have
the
option
of
having
the
bussing
plan
of
any
kind,
and
they
also
have
the
option
of
charging
a
fee
or
not
within
the
limitation,
of
course;
and
they
also
have
the
option
to
determine
how
far
away
from
school
they
require
people
to
live
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
system.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
no.
the
statutes
don't
say
that.
that
would
be
another
lawsuit.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
in
the
reorganized
districts
it
says
nothing
about
fee.
it
doesn't
say
they
can
charge
it;
it
doesn't
say
they
can't
charge
it.
and
they
don't
charge
it.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
i
think
that's
true.
and
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
change
that.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
absolutely.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
that's
true.
and
they
charge
different
fees.
they're
more
expensive
in
some
of
the--
mr.
george
t.
dynes
--that
in
effect
is
true.
but
as
i
said,
they
don't
haul
all
of
the
children.
and
i
wanted
to
mention
that
the--
mr.
george
t.
dynes
--that's
right.
they're--
mr.
george
t.
dynes
--some
of
them
pick
them
up
at
the
door
and
some
of
them
don't.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
the
statute
addresses,
that
talks
about
those
fees,
talks
only
about
the
non-reorganized
districts.
it
simply
doesn't
apply
in
any
respect
to
the
districts
that
are
reorganized.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
i
think
it's
correct.
i
don't
know
that
they
have
said...
that
the
reorganized
districts
can't
charge
a
fee,
but
your
honor,
that
really
isn't
the
issue.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
all
right,
i
stand
corrected,
i
guess
they
have
raised
that
issue.
we
will
accept
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
certainly
the
reorganized
districts
can't
charge.
i
know
that
they
don't
charge
it.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
justice
kennedy,
as
i
mentioned,
i
think
the
court
recognizes
the
argument
for
the
rational
basis
for
the
reorganized
district,
having
a
busing
plan.
they're
required
to
have
a
bussing
plan.
the
other
districts
have
never
been
required
to
have
a
bussing
plan.
it's
been
optional.
the
charging
of
the
fee,
the
rational
basis
is
simply
to
allocate
available
public
funds.
the
cost
of
this
bus
is
paid
in
dickinson
and
it'll
vary
from
district
to
district
may
charge
a
fee
about
11
percent
by
the
users;
about
11
percent
by
the
local
taxpayers,
which
of
course,
includes
all
those
who
have
used
the
bus
and
who
don't
and
the
rest
of
it
is
state
money.
only
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
students
ride
the
bus,
about
13
percent.
the
other
87
percent
furnish
their
own
transportation
to
and
from
school
because
they
live
within
the
four
mile
and
within
the
three-mile
limitation.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
i
don't
believe
you've
read
the
entire
opinion.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
that's
the
separate
legislation
that
requires
that
they
have
a
bus
plan
in
place,
which
they
do,
the
reorganized
districts.
but
the
separate
rational
basis
for
letting
them
charge...
for
letting
these
other
districts,
charge
a
fee
who
don't
have
to
have
a
plan
in
place--
mr.
george
t.
dynes
--i
could
pass
a
note
through
mr.
spaeth
later
if
you'd
like.
i'm
pretty
sure
it's
in
the
opinion.
mr.
george
t.
dynes
it's
been
neglected
in
the
briefs,
i
think.
