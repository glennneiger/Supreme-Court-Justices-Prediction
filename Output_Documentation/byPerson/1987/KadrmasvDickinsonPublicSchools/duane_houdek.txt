mr.
duane
houdek
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
the
court
is
called
upon
to
examine
the
constitutionality
under
the
"equal
protection"
clause
of
a
fee
charged
of
some
north
dakota
parents
to
bus
their
children
to
school.
the
fee
is
imposed
only
in
a
minority
of
districts
which
includes
the
dickinson
district,
where
the
plaintiffs
reside.
in
a
majority
of
districts
in
north
dakota,
busing
is
provided
to
all
free
of
charge
subject
to
local
mileage
limitations.
that
is
a
statutory
mandate
in
all
of
those
other
districts
which
compromise
some
260
out
of
the
310
districts
in
the
state.
within
the
dickinson
district,
the
fee
is
imposed
against
all
save
handicapped
or
special
education
students
without
exemption,
without
regard
to
ability
to
pay
or
the
financial
status
of
the
parents.
the
effects
of
these
two
aspects
of
the
dickinson
bussing
policy
and
the
authorizing
statute
come
together
and
converge
in
this
case
where
a
poor
family,
unable
to
pay
the
fee,
lives
within
one
of
the
few
districts
where
the
fee
is
permitted
to
be
charged.
the
parent
who
brought
this
case,
paula
kadrmas,
lives
with
her
husband
and
three
children
called
new
hradec,
north
dakota,
on
a
farm
that
is
some
16
miles
from
the
school
their
oldest
daughter
is
designated
to
attend
by
the
district.
she
encounters
the
fee
at
all,
again,
only
because
she
happens
to
live
in
that
type
of
district.
if
she
lived
in
any
other
districts,
there
would
not
be
any
kind
of
bussing
fee
that
could,
by
law,
be
charged
to
her.
mr.
duane
houdek
they've
come
to
be
known,
and
it's
a
rather
awkward
set
of
terms,
justice
o'connor,
reorganized
and
non-reorganized.
mr.
duane
houdek
and
the
reorganized
districts
have
done
so
pursuant
to
statutes
that
were
passed
in
the
'40s
to
encourage
an
economy
of
scale,
if
you
would.
mr.
duane
houdek
i
think
it
is.
i
don't
have
the
exact
figures,
but
i
think
it's
pretty
close.
and
what
that
shows
is
that
the
non-reorganized
districts
are
generally
the
districts
in
the
larger
cities
or
towns
and
have
a
higher
population
of
students,
than
the
smaller
districts.
mr.
duane
houdek
they're
living
in
the
same
location,
their
circumstances
have
greatly
deteriorated.
at
the
time
of
trial
it
was
found
that
after
paying
taxes
of
some
$2500
they
had
about
$12,500
left
for
a
family
of
five.
since
that
time,
they
have
started
on
a
cattle
enterprise,
if
you
will.
they
got
a
loan
to
try
and
raise
some
calves--
mr.
duane
houdek
--that
remains
to
be
seen,
justice
white
until
calving
this
spring.
but
the
point
of
it
is
that
out
of
this
money
that
was
allocated
to
them,
prior
to
them
getting
any
income
at
all
from
this
operation,
they
were
given
only
$12,000
to
live
on
for
the
year,
half
of
which
inadvertently
went
to
the
former
landowner,
so
they
had
$6,000.
mr.
duane
houdek
she
has
been
denied
access
to
the
bussing
system.
mr.
duane
houdek
she
has
not
missed
school
because
of
it.
she
has
made
it
to
school.
mr.
duane
houdek
no,
i
don't
think
there
is
at
all,
your
honor,
for
one
thing
part
of
the
challenged
statutes
include
payment
of
the
fee
or
the
demand
for
the
fee,
and
that
goes
on
whether
or
not
she
actually
made
it
to
school
or
not,
so
i
think
that
remains.
mr.
duane
houdek
no,
if
that
was
all
that
was
left,
we
would
not.
mr.
duane
houdek
yes.
i
believe,
implicit
in
my
analysis
there
is
more
left
than
that,
your
honor.
mr.
duane
houdek
they
did.
what
happened
there,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
because
of
a
north
dakota
case
decided
in
the
north
dakota
supreme
court.
the
court
stated
that
if
anybody
signed
a
contract,
one
of
these
busing
contracts
that
are
frequently
used,
or
were
used
in
the
bismark
district,
at
any
rate,
then
they
could
not
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
having
to
pay
that
fee.
and
so
the
plaintiffs
in
dickinson,
once
the
district
was
adamant
about
demanding
them
to
sign
such
a
contract,
were
put
in
a
position
that
if
they
did
so,
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
bring
their
case
in
state
court.
so
they
were
left
with
that
on
one
side;
the
compulsory
attendance
laws
of
north
dakota
on
the
other
side,
forcing
them
to
in
some
manner
get
their
children
to
school,
and
the
only
thing
left
was
to
drive
them
themselves.
mr.
duane
houdek
no,
no,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
believe
that's
true
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
that
recently
this
court
has
stated
that
even
under
the
minimum
rational
basis
test
of
equal
protection,
it
is
looking
when
there
are
rights
that
are
important,
such
as
the
one
we're
dealing
with
here,
are
rights
that
have
been
called
by
this
court
important
to
the
fabric
of
our
society,
and
to
all
the
political
processes
that
citizens
need
to
engage
in.
mr.
duane
houdek
we
are
very
much
talking
access
for
someone
who
doesn't
have
that
money,
nor
the
ability
to
drive
those
children
to
school
herself.
mr.
duane
houdek
she
did
for
this
year,
but
it
is
clear
ion
the
documents
that
were
filed
in
response
to
the
motion
to
dismiss,
they
can't
be
expected
to
do
that
every
year.
they
did
it
at
great
personal
expense;
they
did
it
by
incurring
debt
that
sooner
or
later
that
credit
is
going
to
be
cut
off
to
people
of
their
means.
they
did
it
only
through
the
most
extraordinary.
mr.
duane
houdek
no,
your
honor,
she
has
not.
she
has
gone
to
school.
i
believe
it
is
necessary
to
recognize
that
this
transportation
scheme
in
north
dakota
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
education
system,
and
not
merely
some
benefit
like
a
band
uniform
might
be
or
something
else.
mr.
duane
houdek
no
i
don't
believe
we
do.
mr.
duane
houdek
sure.
that
was
raised
in
one
of
the
amici
briefs,
i
believe,
as
kind
of
a
user
fee
analysis.
mr.
duane
houdek
here
this
is
not
a
user
fee
situation,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
duane
houdek
no.
and
here's
what
i
think
is
the
fundamental
difference.
a
driver's
license
is
a
privilege
the
state
gives
someone
and
someone
can
apply
for
it
or
not.
here
attendance
at
school--
mr.
duane
houdek
--it
is
important.
granted.
but
attendance
at
school,
and
at
school,
not
education
in
your
home,
but
attendance
at
school
in
north
dakota,
is
compulsory.
it
is
mandatory.
the
state
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
districts
recognizes
that
and
provides
transportation
free-of-charge,
and
that
has
been
a
historical
tradition
in
north
dakota,
so
much
so
that
the
compulsory
education
laws
were
not
enforced
against
people
who
lived
away
from
the
school,
and
for
whom
the
district
did
not
provide
transportation.
so
it
is
more
than
simply
a
benefit
that
one
might
avail
themselves
of.
mr.
duane
houdek
yes,
if
i
may
answer
that
from
a
couple
of
different
approaches:
first,
that
has
not
been
judicially
construed
to
say
whether
or
not
it
would
include
transportation.
mr.
duane
houdek
we
brought
this
waiver
statute
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
and
to
the
other
side,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
no
one
has
ever--
mr.
duane
houdek
--that
has
never
been
established
that
it--
mr.
duane
houdek
--i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
if
that
statute
is
so-construed,
that
that
would
go
a
long
way
to
resolving
the
constitutional
problems
that
are
here.
mr.
duane
houdek
certainly
so,
certainly
so.
if
as
the
appellees
have
seemed
to
indicate,
that
that
statute
takes
care
of
the
entire
problem,
yet
it
is
more
than
a
little
curious
that
that
statute
has
been
raised
by
them
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
after
some
two
years
of
litigation.
mr.
duane
houdek
that's
right.
but
i--
mr.
duane
houdek
--that's
right.
i
interpreted
the
question,
your
honor,
as
it
would
apply
to
our
clients.
they
would
be
covered
by
such
a
statute
because
they
would
certainly
fall
within
those
whose
privileges
or
educational
opportunities
would
be
taken
away
because
of
a
lack
of
an
ability
to
pay.
and
if
the
statute
prohibits
that,
then
they
would
be
covered.
it
does
not,
as
you
suggest,
cover
any
kind
of
geographical
disparity
that
exists
within
the
state.
mr.
duane
houdek
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
duane
houdek
all
i
could
say
to
that
is
that
someone
with
their
income
and
their
family
composition
does
not
qualify,
then
that
statute
would
not
be
protecting
their
children.
mr.
duane
houdek
well,
it's
interesting:
all
along,
it
seems,
the
appellees
have
said
"there's
no
need
for
a
waiver
in
this
case;
we
have
one
in
the
statute.
"
"we
do
this
as
kind
of
a
noblesse
oblige,
but
if
in
fact
they
are
saying
that
statute
applies,
and
if
they
will
say
that
that
is
the
law
in
north
dakota,
that
they
will
not
deny
a
student
access
to
that
bus
system
if
they
haven't
an
ability
to
pay,
and
they
will
not
attempt
to
collect
from
a
parent
as
an
ability
to
pay
the
fee
that
may
otherwise
may
be
involved,
then
we're
a
long
way
towards
settling
this
case.
"
but
up
to
this
point,
that
has
never
been
done.
they
have
never
been
willing
to
admit
that.
mr.
duane
houdek
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
duane
houdek
no.
it
does
say
that--
mr.
duane
houdek
--that's
right.
if
that
statute
meant
that,
then
she
should
have
never
been
turned
down.
mr.
duane
houdek
yes,
absolutely.
i
think
in
that
way
it's
analogous,
perhaps
to
providing
indigent
counsel
and
then
trying
to
recoup
that
if
the
person
thereafter
comes
into
funds.
i
agree.
i
believe
in--
mr.
duane
houdek
--right.
mr.
duane
houdek
right,
so
it's
a
real
catch-22.
if
they
maintain
that
position,
then
they
would
never
know
whether
they
would
get
into
a
situation
where
the
statute
pertained.
and
i
might
add,
that
refusal
to
sign
the
contract
has
been
characterized
as
something
that
was
done
to,
like
our
clients
thought
it
up
to
maintain
standing.
it
was
demanded
of
them...
for
the
very
reason
that,
if
they
did
it,
they
couldn't
challenge
any
of
the
fees.
it
came
from
exactly
the
other
way
around.
to
summarize
that
point,
if
i
might,
i
think
everyone
here
involved
in
this
case
and
the
court
below,
recognized
the
essential
nature
of
transportation
to
education
in
north
dakota
where
we
have
these
very
large
districts
and
centralized
schools
and
a
rural
population.
i
mean,
the
majority
did;
the
dissent
below
did;
the
appellees
seem
to
concede
that.
mr.
duane
houdek
yes.
i
think,
of
course,
justice
white,
that
this
court,
because
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case
need
not
go
nearly
so
far.
mr.
duane
houdek
our
argument
is
that--
mr.
duane
houdek
--yes,
it
is
also
about--
mr.
duane
houdek
--that's
correct.
i
believe
that's
true.
but
again,
i
don't
think
any
decision
of
this
court
would
have
to
rest
on
that
ground
alone
because
our
clients
clearly
fall
within
however
you
might
define
poor
people.
mr.
duane
houdek
i
think
what
it
would...
that's
a
fair
characterization,
your
honor.
mr.
duane
houdek
that
would
come
in
to
play
if
within
the
context
of
the
present
system,
where
were
they
compel
attendance
to
school,
where
that
is
mandatory;
where
if
there's
someone
20
miles
from
the
school
they
provide
who
has
absolutely
no
way
of
getting
in
there--
mr.
duane
houdek
--that
there
is...
it's
not
recently,
your
honor.
recently,
the
cases
have
taken
on
a
home-school
kind
of
issue
and
people
keeping
them
back
for
because
of
their
choice
in
education.
but
there
has
been
at
least
one
case
where
the
north
dakota
court
has
held
that
where
a
person
was
offered
only
a
$.50
per
day
transportation
allowance
and
not
actually
brought
to
school
could
not
be
subject
to
prosecution
for
compulsory
attendance.
mr.
duane
houdek
in
the
context
you
mean,
i
am
not
aware
there
are
a
lot,
your
honor.
mr.
duane
houdek
while
i
agree
that
the
denial
of
the
public
school
education
is
an
extremely
important
factor,
and
denial
of
such
a
right
does
raise
these
constitutional
issues.
i
think
that
the
part
about
compulsory
attendance
merely
brings
it
into
finer
focus.
i
mean,
here's
a
state
that's
saying
education
is
so
important
you've
got
to
get
there;
you've
to
do
it
in
our
schools;
we're
going
to
give
transportation
to
most
of
the
districts,
but
we're
going
to
withhold
some.
and
we're
going
to
do
from
the
poor
within
those
districts
as
well,
without
any
kind
of
a
waiver
situation,
because
that's
the
way
it
has
been
applied.
i
believe
the
appellees
can
say
all
they
want
that
informally
they
will
do
this
or
they
will
do
that;
but
unless
our
clients
have
some
legal
guarantee,
i
think
that's
an
empty
promise.
the
administrations
change;
circumstances
and
people
change,
and
unless
it
is
backed
up
by
some
active
legal
significance,
i
don't
think
that
promise
is
enough.
i
would
like
at
this
point
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
at
this
point
for
rebuttal.
mr.
duane
houdek
thank
you
your
honor,
i
would
first
like
to
point
out
that
the
concept
of
reorganization
did
not
create
the
right
to
bussing
in
north
dakota.
it
is
not
as
though
there
was
no
bussing.
and
the
reorganization
statutes
then
created
that
right.
bussing
existed
long
before
1947
when
the
reorganization
statutes
were
passed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
the
statutes
did
was
to
ensure
that
that
tradition
would
continue.
mr.
duane
houdek
yes,
your
honor.
older
cases
have
said
that
this
very
statute
that
gave
an
option
of
providing
transportation
or
making
in
lieu
payments,
although
they
were
discretionary
in
which
you
did,
they
were
mandatory
that
you
did
one
or
the
other.
so
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
reorganization
statute.
secondly,
this
is
not
a
local
option
case.
this
is
not
a
rodriguez
"difference
in
quality
of
education".
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
these
are
mostly
state
funds,
and
it's
more
than
2/3rds.
and
in
may
cases
it's
80
percent
of
the
funds
are
state
monies
that
are
being
distributed
to
the
various
districts.
withholding
80
percent...
withholding
all
of
that
benefit
because
of
the
failure
to
pay
that
fee--
mr.
duane
houdek
--yes.
that's
true,
but
withholding
it
from
a
person
who
doesn't
pay
it,
withholding
all
that
state
benefit,
is
not
something
that
a
local
option
ought
to
be
able
to
do.
mr.
duane
houdek
no,
i
wouldn't,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it's
even
worse
that
this
fee
could
deny
those
people
all
of
the
state
benefit
as
well.
the
formula
apart
from
that,
they
don't
pay
the
same
percentage
in
every
district;
the
formula
is
the
same;
the
state
funding
of
transportation
formula
is
based
on
whether
you
use
a
small
or
a
large
bus;
and
the
number
of
pupil
days.
some
districts
get
over
100
percent;
they
get
more
than
their
cost.
some
get
50
percent,
so
the
percentage
is
not
the
same.
mr.

houdek
no.
it
is
like
other
parts
of
education;
people
pay
taxes
and
fund
it
whether
they
have
children
or
not
because
education
is
important
to
our
society
as
a
whole.
and
this
is
the
same
concept,
your
honor,
at
least
i
see
that
in
that
fashion.
the
question
or
the
specter
that
this
is
a
local
kind
of
case
it
think
is
most
disturbing
because
we're
not
talking
about
the
inability
of
a
district
to
tailor
a
plan
mileage
limits
based
on
the
size
of
the
cities
within
their
district
or
anything
like
that.
they
most
certainly
have
the
right
to
do
that.
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
denial
altogether
of
the
essential
part
of
the
education
process
in
north
dakota.
the
difference,
i
think,
in
the
geographic
cases
that
were
cited
by
mr.
spaeth,
here
we
have
that
element
of
compulsion
again,
and
we
have
the
benefit
being
given
throughout
the
state
and
then
being
arbitrarily
withheld.
most
of
the
questions
i
noted
from
this
court
has
been
what
is
the
purpose
of
this?
why
do
we
have
this
difference?
the
reorganization
statute
in
1947
reorganized
the
state
as
it
was
destined
and
designed
to
do.
the
fee
statute,
32
years
later,
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
that.
it
served
no
purpose.
it
has
little
to
do
with
reorganizing
those
districts
as
any
other
statute
you
might
find
on
the
book.
that
process,
as
they
have
conceded,
is
complete,
and
it
is
not
likely
to
happen
in
dickinson.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
