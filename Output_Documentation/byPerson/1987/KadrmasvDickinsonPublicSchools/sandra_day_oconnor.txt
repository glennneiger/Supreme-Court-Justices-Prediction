justice
o'connor
there
are
two
types
of
school
districts
in
north
dakota;
the
organized
and
the
reorganized,
is
that
it?
justice
o'connor
organized
and
non-reorganized.
justice
o'connor
and
in
terms
of
numbers
of
students,
is
it
about
equally
divided
among
the
two
types
of
districts?
justice
o'connor
are
the
appellants
still
living
in
the
same
location
and
their
circumstances
have
not
improved,
i
take
it?
justice
o'connor
now,
serita
has
not
actually
been
denied
access
to
school
in
fact,
has
she,
to
public
school
education?
justice
o'connor
my
question
was
whether
she
has,
for
purposes
of
this
lawsuit
been
denied
access
to
education,
the
public
school
education.
justice
o'connor
is
there
any
kind
of
ripeness
problem?
excuse
me?
justice
o'connor
mr.
houdek,
do
you
lose
your
case
unless
the
court
applies
some
form
of
heightened
scrutiny?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
it
were
a
charge
of
something
to
get
a
driver's
license?
do
we
have
the
same
problem
if
the
person
can't
afford
to
pay
it?
justice
o'connor
or
a
charge
for
taking
garbage
away?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
a
little
charge
for
transportation
is
a
user
fee
in
a
sense?
justice
o'connor
but
desperately
important,
is
it
not?
justice
o'connor
what
about
this
statute
in
north
dakota
that
says
"no
students
rights
or
privileges
shall
be
denied
for
non-payment
of
fees?
"
justice
o'connor
have
you
argued
that
it
does
include
transportation?
justice
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
statute
protects
your
client
from
the
payment
of
the
fee?
justice
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
it
does?
justice
o'connor
yes,
i
suppose
you
certainly
would
want
to
argue
that
it
covers
your
client,
if
you
have
any
interest
in
protecting
them
at
all.
justice
o'connor
mr.
dynes,
i
guess
no
matter
how
we
view
the
case,
we
have
to
address
the
argument
here
that
there's
an
equal
protection
denial
by
virtue
of
different
treatment
in
north
dakota
of
reorganized
school
districts
for
bus
transportation
and
non-reorganized
districts?
justice
o'connor
and
the
supreme
court
apparently
found
that
the
statute
authorizing
bus
fees
in
non-reorganized
school
districts,
but
not
in
the
reorganized
ones,
was
rationally
related
to
the
legitimate
government
purpose
of
encouraging
reorganization?
justice
o'connor
we
now
have
this
scheme
on
the
books
and
if
it's
a
reorganized
district,
they
can't
charge
bus
fees,
and
if
it
isn't
they
can,
and
that's
being
challenged?
justice
o'connor
now
what
is
the
legitimate
governmental
purpose
now,
do
you
suppose,
in
that
difference?
justice
o'connor
so
i'm
asking
you
for
what
governmental
purpose
we
should
look
in
the
discrepancy
here?
how
do
you
defend
it?
justice
o'connor
and
never
will
be.
justice
o'connor
too
big.
justice
o'connor
i
thought
that
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
reorganized
districts
could
not
charge
a
bussing
fee.
i
thought
that
was
the
assumption
on
which
they
took
the
case?
justice
o'connor
well
what
does
the
supreme
court
say?
justice
o'connor
--the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court,
i
thought,
stated
that
the
north
dakota
statute
allows
only
those
school
districts
which
have
not
been
reorganized
to
charge
a
fee
for
school
bus
service?
justice
o'connor
and
that's
what
they
said.
but
you
say
we
don't
pay
any
attention
to
that?
justice
o'connor
but
don't
we
have
to
accept
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
placed
on
them
by
the
supreme
court
of
your
state?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
that
was
one
of
the
issues
raised
by
the
appellant?
justice
o'connor
general
spaeth,
can
a
reorganized
school
district
charge
for
school
busing?
justice
o'connor
so
we
can
put
that
at
rest?
justice
o'connor
all
right,
and
so
on
the
equal
protection
challenge,
as
to
the
difference
between
the
reorganized
and
the
unreorganized
districts,
what
is
the
legitimate
governmental
justification
for
it?
justice
o'connor
i
guess
it's
enough
to
raise
the
challenge,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
let's
talk
about
this
state
law.
it
would
have
permitted
serita
to
board
the
bus,
whether
her
parents
paid
or
not?
justice
o'connor
would
it
have
excused
her
parents
from
paying?
justice
o'connor
you
think
it
addresses
that?
justice
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
case
of
kadrmas
versus
dickinson
public
schools,
it
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota.
under
the
statutes
of
that
state,
some
local
school
districts
are
required
to
provide
free
school
bus
service
for
their
students.
other
districts
are
given
the
option
of
providing
transportation
to
school
and
they
may
impose
a
user
fee
on
families
who
take
advantage
of
the
bus
service
if
it
is
provided.
appellants
or
a
school
child
and
her
mother
who
live
in
a
district
that
imposes
a
user
fee
covering
part
of
the
school
bus
service.
this
family
whose
resources
put
it
at
or
near
the
official
poverty
level
refused
to
pay
the
user
fee
and
the
child
was
denied
access
to
the
school
bus.
the
family
thereafter
arranged
for
private
transportation
and
the
appellant
sued
the
school
district
in
the
state
court.
this
law
suit
which
sought
an
injunction
prevent
the
school
district
from
collecting
any
fee
for
the
bus
service,
raised
two
federal
claims
that
are
at
issue
in
the
--
in
this
court.
the
appellants
argued
that
the
bus
fee
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
discriminates
against
the
poor.
second,
the
appellants
argue
that
the
state
statutes
violate
equal
protection
because
they
irrationally
allow
some
school
districts
but
not
others
to
impose
user
fees
for
the
bus
service.
the
north
dakota
courts
dismissed
the
suit
on
the
merits.
in
an
opinion
filed
to
day,
we
affirm.
we
hold
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
require
strict
scrutiny
in
this
case
because
poverty
does
not
define
a
suspect
class
and
education
is
not
a
fundamental
right
within
the
meaning
of
our
prior
decisions.
we
therefore
test
the
state
laws
by
asking
whether
they
have
irrational
relation
to
a
legitimate
government
objective.
for
reasons
explained
in
the
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
user
fee
is
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
objective.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan
has
joined.
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
