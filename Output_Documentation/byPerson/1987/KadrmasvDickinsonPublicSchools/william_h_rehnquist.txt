chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what?
her
folks
took
her
to
school.
they
drove
her
to
school,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
this
person
got
to
school.
chief
justice
rehnquist
maybe
at
that
time
you
will
have
a
different
lawsuit,
but
it
seems
to
me
now
she's
been
deprived
of
bus
transportation
because
she
couldn't
pay
for
it.
now
that
raises
an
obvious
equal
protection
problem.
but
she
hasn't
been
deprived
of
going
to
school,
has
she?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
evidence
that
north
dakota
has
ever
prosecuted
anyone
under
the
truancy
statute
who
was
simply
unable
to
afford
the
bus
to
school
and
therefore
did
not
come?
chief
justice
rehnquist
could
not
be?
i
don't
think
you
said,
"could
not
be"?
is
there
any
case
ever
holding
otherwise
in
north
dakota?
i
mean,
are
there
many
prosecutions
under
the
truancy
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what's
reality
at
issue
is
what
you
say
is
the
denial
of
the
right
to
public
school
education,
not
the
dilemma
that
you're
going
to
be
prosecuted
for
truancy
if
you
cannot
afford
to
go
on
the
bus?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
houdek.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
dynes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
the
case
of
a
non-reorganized
district,
which
i
take
it
dickinson
is--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--is
the
district
simply
left
free
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
will
charge
a
fee?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
not
as
if
the
state
says
you
will
charge
a
fee
to
some
districts
and
you
won't
to
others,
and
with
the
districts
that
aren't
reorganized,
they
are
left
a
local
option?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
with
the
reorganized
districts,
the
state
tells
them
you
can't
charge
a
fee?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
your
view,
so
far
as
the
north
dakota
statute
are
concerned,
it's
optional
to
charge
fees
for
the
school
bus
in
both
kinds
of
districts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
well,
i
think
what
several
of
us
are
trying
to
find
out
is,
do
the
north
dakota
statutes
mandate
one
way
or
another
as
to
whether
a
fee
should
be
charged
for
a
school
bus
trip
in
(a)
the
reorganized
districts;
and
(b)
the
other
districts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dynes.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
general
spaeth.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
general
spaeth.
mr.
houdek,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
general,
your
opponent
suggests
that
the
fee
equals
only
the
local
contribution.
that
the
2/3rds
of
the
state
money
goes
anyway.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
suppose
you
could
say
you
could
offer
to
take
2/3rds
of
it
away
with
the
school,
would
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
houdek.
the
case
is
submitted.
