mr.
nicholas
spaeth
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
may
it
please
the
court,
before
beginning
the
argument
i've
prepared,
i
would
like
to
pick
up
on
a
question
justice
stevens
just
asked
because
i
can
tell
that
the
court
is
interested
in
it.
the
reorganization
statute
which
was
passed
by
the
legislature
quite
a
long
time
ago,
did
have
as
its
purpose
to
encourage
reorganization,
and
it
did
encourage
reorganization
in
the
vast
majority
of
school
districts
in
this
state.
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
examine
it
solely
in
the
context
of
dickinson
where
there
was
no
reorganization.
it's
done
its
work
throughout
the
rest
of
the
state,
and
it's
done
it
in
a
pretty
fair
and
rational
way.
it's
purpose
was
to
encourage
consolidation,
and
as
a
quid
pro
quo,
where
there
was
consolidation,
to
guarantee
that
there
would
be
school
bus
transportation
provided
to
parents
who
were
fearful
that
when
their
local
school
closed,
they
would
have
to
face
the
responsibility
of
bussing
or
transporting
your
child
in
from
a
great
distance.
and
that
system
has
to
be
looked
at
based
on
its
impact
on
the
entire
state.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
no,
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
think
you
are
absolutely
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
we
can
put
that
at
rest,
that's
right.
only
unreorganized
school
districts
may
and
it's
their
option.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
it
was
a
local
option
to
provide
each
school
district
with
the
choice
of
deciding
first
of
all
whether
it
wanted
to
reorganize;
then
if
it
decided
not
to
reorganize,
whether
it
wanted
to
charge
a
fee?
the
statute
is
actually
neutral
on
its
face.
it
does
not
say,
in
some
districts,
a
fee
must
be
paid
and
others
not.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
no,
it
still
has
a
rationale
in
the
sense
that
it
provides
the
non-reorganized
school
districts
with
an
option.
it
gives
them
the
choice:
do
we
want
to
fund
this
service
or
do
we
not.
that
is
certainly
is
a
rational
basis.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
not
just
poor
families.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
what
happened
here,
justice
stevens,
is
there
was
a
very
rational
scheme
was
put
in
place
given
the
needs
of
the
state
as
a
whole,
and
you're
focusing
on
the
dickinson
school
district,
where
it
isn't.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
because
when
the
legislature
was
considering
this
problem,
the
legislature
emerged
from
a
political
compromise
and
realized
that,
in
order
to
provide
some
districts
with
an
incentive
to
reorganize,
it
was
going
to
have
to
put
in
some
guarantee
that
transportation
would
be
provided.
it
didn't
need
that
same
incentive
if
they
weren't
going
to
reorganize,
because
generally...
of
course,
not
in
every
case...
but
generally
there
wasn't
the
same
transportation
problem;
that
the
students
would
live
close
enough
to
their
school
where
they
wouldn't
need
free
transportation.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
the
primary
focus
was
to
encourage
this
process
of
consolidation,
and
in
order
to
get
this
legislation
through,
that
important
protection
had
to
be
put
in
to
encourage
the
consolidation
process,
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here.
now,
there's
one
other
issue
that
troubles
the
court,
and
i
want
to
talk
about
it,
and
that
is,
how
did
this
case
get
here?
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
state
may
deny
equal
access
to
education
to
a
distinct
class
of
people,
basically
minor
people
whose
parents
are
below
the
poverty
level;
i
don't
think
on
the
record
here
that
question
is
presented.
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
this
case
may
not
be
ripe
is
entirely
a
correct
one:
first
of
all,
there
is
no
question
they
weren't
denied
education.
serita
attended
school
through
the
entire
course
of
this
litigation.
second,
she
wasn't
even
denied
transportation
on
the
school
bus.
all
that
was
required
was
that
her
parents
sign
this
contract.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
well,
the
state
law
would
have
provided
for
a
waiver
of
fee;
and
no
waiver--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--that
is
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
yes,
it
would.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
yes,
all
you
have
to
do
is
if
you
look
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
court's
finding
of
fact
no.
14,
that's
located
on
page
7
of
the
joint
appendix...
what
the
court
decided
based
on
the
conflicting
evidence
was
all
that
the
dickinson
school
district
required
was
that
the
parents
sign
the
written
agreement
to
pay
fees,
and
make
a
bona
fide
effort
to
pay
on
these
obligations,
a
bona
fide
effort.
it's
an
open-ended
kind
of
obligation.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
in
fact,
she'd
been
bussed
for
three
years
without
payment
of
any
fees.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that's
correct,
and
there
goes
the
equal
protection
argument.
that's
what
is
important
about
the
contract...
because
economic
situations
do
change.
and
even
though
the
dickinson
school
district
is
not
going
to
try
to
come
out
and
garnish
their
earnings
to
pay
a
fee
now--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--that's
right.
as
long
as
you're
poor,
you
don't
pay.
but
if
you
come
in
to
money
through
cattle
or
through
the
lottery,
then
you
are
going
to
be--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--if
you
put
it
in
that
sense,
right.
if
you
consider
that
the
state
has
somehow
dictated
this
kind
of
discrimination.
i
don't
think
it
has
because
the
statute
is
neutral.
but
they
you're
left
with
some
sort
of
purely
geographic
difference
which
the
court
from
mcgowan
v.
maryland
on,
has
put
a
minimal
of
scrutiny
on.
of
course
there
are
distinctions
between
counties,
or
the
school
districts,
based
on
this
fee,
but
those
kinds
of
distinctions
exist
all
over.
they
exist
in
life,
and
the
constitution
has
never
provided
a
remedy
for
that
kind
of
discrimination.
and
that's
where
i
think
we're
left
with
the
barest
minimum
scrutiny
of
a
statute
that
on
the
whole
works
pretty
well.
it's
not
perfect--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--i
am
tempted
to
respond,
justice
stevens,
by
saying
that
is
not
the
case
here,
but
two
weeks
ago--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--justice
scalia
warned
the
assembled
attorney-generals
in
this
room
that
we
were
not
to
answer
a
question
that
way;
that
we
were
indeed
required
to
answer
a
question
anyway,
even
if
we
don't
believe
it
applies.
and
you
might
have
a
different
case
there.
we're
not
dealing
with
the--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--yes,
it
would,
and
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
this
court's
decision
in
mcgowan
v.
maryland
and
an
earlier
case,
calvert
v.
maryland,
where
there
were
different...
ann
arundel
county
had
different
sets
of
rules
than
other
counties,
those
kinds
of
challenges
were
raised
and
rejected.
unless
the
court
were
to
create
a
new
form
of
constitutional
protection,
those
kinds
of
things
would
be
okay.
the
remedy
there,
of
course,
is
some
sort
of
due
process
action
against
the
individual
entity.
but
it
is
not
an
equal
protection
case.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
it
depends,
i
suppose,
on
the
purpose,
justice
marshall.
it
depends
upon
what
the
purpose
of
that.
if
the
purpose
was
to
disadvantage
some
distinct
minority
group,
identifiable,
yes
it
might
be.
you
know,
if
we're
talking
about
aliens
being
forced
to
go
to
school
somewhere
else
because
they're
aliens,
or
even
if
the
state
of
north
dakota
said
poor
people
are
going
to
go
to
school
in
galveston,
instead
of
in
houston,
we
might
have
a
problem.
but
the
state
doesn't
do
that
here.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
they're
going
to
have
to
move
there,
i
think,
is
what
the
answer
is.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
no
it's
not.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
it's
not
the
state
making
that
decision,
justice
marshall.
it's
the
individual
school
district
deciding
whether
or
not
to
fund
that.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
it
does,
justice
marshall.
it
offers
it
on
the
same
basis
as
everybody.
the
state
funds--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--no,
the
state,
just
for
your
information,
in
this
case
the
state
funds
2/3rds
of
the
transportation
costs
to
the
local
district,
and
it's
only
the
other
third
that
we're
talking
about
right
here,
the
school
district--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
justice
marshall,
but
we're
talking--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--yes.
it's
a
uniform
system
applied
across
the
board
in
the
state.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
i
disagree.
it's
no
different
than
texas
financing
system
in
rodriguez,
where
the
state
didn't
provide
all
of
the
funding
for
education
to
allow
the
school
district
to
decide
how
much
more
it
was
going
to
contribute.
in
this
case
the
state
provides
2/3rds
of
it;
the
school
district
itself
picks
up
another
roughly
six;
and
the
parents
are
called
upon
to
provide
the
remaining
six.
it's
just
one
way
that
benefits...
and
we're
talking
about
economic
benefits
here;
there
are
a
host
of
other
examples
here:
medicare,
medicaid;
where
people
using
those
kinds
of
services
have
to
pay
a
user
fee.
that's
also
true
in
food
stamps.
we
are
talking
here
about
some
things
in
life
that
are
even
more
important
than
education
where
the
users
of
those
benefits
have
to
pay
part
of
the
cost.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that's
right,
the
taxpayers
there.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
right
and
it
generally
is
property
taxes,
which
are
not,
you
know,
which
are
tax,
and
you
could
argue,
i
suppose
that
poor
people
aren't
likely
to
pay
property
taxes,
and
therefore
are
likely
to
get
a
free
ride
in
those
kinds
of
accountings.
but
i
don'
think
we're
dealing
with--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--again,
i
think
we
are
dealing
here
with
something
that
is
an
economic
benefit,
and
we
have
one
school
district
here
that's
charging
a
small
amount
for
it.
i
don't
think
it's
unconstitutional.
i
think
it's
some
thing
that
probably
isn't
even
properly
raised
in
this
case.
if
the
court
wanted
to
duck
this
case;
i
think
that
the
record
is
such
that
it
could
be
affirmed
almost
on
an
ulterior
basis.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
they
certainly
do.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
in
many
cases
that's
right,
justice
white,
and
you
know
it--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--yes,
that's
correct.
but
that's
what
we're
faced
with...
$97.00
a
year,
which
is
a
user
fee
levied
in
one
county
that's
at
issue
here
against
a
background
of
a
system
that
really
did
what
it
was
supposed
to
do,
which
was
to
encourage
the
reorganization
of
most
of
north
dakota
schools.
we're
the
most
agricultural
state
in
the
united
states;
we're
not
a
rich
state
by
any
means;
and
we're
seeing
what's
happening
all
over
the
upper
midwest;
and
that
is
a
shrinking
of
the
rural
population,
even
out
of
the
small
towns
into
the
larger
cities.
and
that's
what's
driven
this
whole
process.
it's
largely
complete
at
this
point,
but
this
program
i
think
has
worked
well.
