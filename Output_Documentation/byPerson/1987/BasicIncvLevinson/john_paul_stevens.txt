mr.
sternman,
can
i
interrupt
you
for
one
minute
to
see
if
i
can
understand
your
theory?
justice
stevens
drawing
a
distinction
between
materiality
on
the
one
hand
and
truth
on
the
other.
justice
stevens
assume
for
just
purposes
of
discussion
that
a
statement
was
made
that
our
management
has
never
met,
we
don't
even
know
anybody
at
combustion
engineering,
a
clearly
false
statement,
but
one
that
was
made
before
any
agreement
in
principle
had
been
reached.
you'd
say
that
was
immaterial
and
not
actionable?
justice
stevens
so
in
order
to
judge
this
case
in
your
theory,
we
don't
really
have
to
pass
on
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
statement,
do
we?
justice
stevens
if
we
accept
your
theory
and
we
also
agree
with
you
that
at
the
time
of
these
statements,
the
discussions
were
sufficiently
tentative
not
to
satisfy
the
test,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
stevens
so
we
don't
really
have
to
worry
about
the
facts
too
much.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
there's
really
that
much
difference
between
the
sec's
test
and
the
court
of
appeal's
test?
justice
stevens
that
would
be
sufficient
to
make
it
untrue,
but
do
you
think
that
also
under
their
view
made
it
sufficient
to
be
material?
justice
stevens
mr.
cross,
i
was
a
little
puzzled
by
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
i
thought
they
specifically
said
they
wanted
trial
on
the
issue
of
scienter.
but
i
thought
the
opinion
subject
to
the
reading,
they
decided
the
falsity
and
materiality
issue.
you
don't
read
it
that
way?
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
you
go
back
to
the
trial
court?
are
you
going
to
start
from
scratch
or
are
you
going
to
argue
that
two
of
those
issues
have
already
been
decided?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
what
is
your
view?
if
this
case
were
affirmed,
what
would
your
position
on
the
materiality
issue
be
in
the
district
court?
justice
stevens
well,
it's
a
little
different
arguing
they're
so
significant
you're
entitled
to
it
as
a
matter
of
law
on
this
record.
that's
different
from
saying
it's
already
been
decided.
i'm
asking
you
whether
you
are
taking
the
position
the
materiality
issue
has
already
been
decided
in
your
favor?
justice
stevens
mr.
sternman,
xx
answer
just
one
quick
question.
you
haven't
commented
at
all
in
the
fact
that
the
data
was
rather
confidential
information
was
given
as
early
as
1976.
would
you
just
respond
to
that
thought?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
