justice
white
--didn't
the
district
court
go
off
on
the
notion
that
whether
these
statements
were
true
or
false,
they
weren't
material.
they
said
they're
not
material
until
there's
a
deal.
justice
white
well,
that
doesn't
depend
on
any
kind
of
factual
notions
about
true
or
false.
justice
white
i
know,
but
that
aspect
would
be
dispositive.
justice
white
well,
then
wholly
aside
from
any
issue
of
fact.
justice
white
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
that
and
said
that
there
can
be
material
facts
represented
prior
to
the
time
there's
a
deal.
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
justice
white
that's
right.
and
none
of
these
statements,
all
these
statements
were
before
that
time.
justice
white
and
so
that
was
the
end
of
the
case
as
far
as
the
district
court
was
concerned.
justice
white
it
didn't
have
to.
justice
white
if
it
wanted
to
take
the
risk
that
it
was
right
on
the
law.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
i
didn't
think
that
you
were,
the
questions
you
present
here
are
in
your
petition
was
just
whether
the
rule
of
law
they
used
with
respect
to
when
a
statement
is
material
and
then
whether
the
presumption
about
reliance.
justice
white
those
are
the
only
things
that
are
before
us.
justice
white
i
know,
but
you've
been
arguing
the
facts
of
the
case
saying
that
they
were
the
facts.
justice
white
well,
if
you
take
the
sec
standard,
that
isn't
the
standard
the
court
of
appeals
used,
either.
so
i
would
suppose
you
would
state
the
right
rule
on
remand
without
dealing
with
the
facts.
justice
white
you
mean
reinstate
the
district
court's
summary
judgment?
justice
white
well,
a
fraud
on
the
market
theory
doesn't
even
require
knowledge,
does
it?
justice
white
that
the
statements
were
made
at
the
time?
justice
white
nevertheless,
just
because
we
bought
or
sold
on
the
market,
we
relied.
justice
white
and
the
market
reflects
accurately
what's
going
on
in
life.
justice
white
that's
the
third
circuit
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
white
any
others?
justice
white
well,
has
any
circuit
other
than
the
sixth
rejected
the
fraud
on
the
market
theory?
justice
white
so
it's
really
just
the
sixth
and
the
third
that
have
really
addressed
it?
justice
white
i
take
it
you
reject
the
sec
test
then,
too?
justice
white
well,
the
sec
clearly
rejects
the
sixth
circuit's
statement
or
holding
that
every
false
statement
is
necessarily
material.
do
you
defend
that?
justice
white
the
district
court
didn't
agree
with
you
on
that.
justice
white
well,
nevertheless,
it
disagreed
with
some
of
the
statements
you've
just
made.
justice
white
you
think
that
the
district
court
found
that
any
of
these
statements
were
false
and
misleading,
or
did
they
think
that
they
weren't?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
how
about
the
other
statements?
justice
white
you
would
say
that
in
response
to
a
specific
question
about
negotiations,
the
corporation
could
say,
no
comment,
and
there
would
be
no
liability?
justice
white
or
none
of
your
business.
justice
white
if
you
were
trying
this
case,
say
there
hadn't
been
summary
judgment,
and
you
actually
got
to
trial,
what
would
be
your
definition
of
materiality?
justice
white
which
is?
justice
white
how
about
reliance?
justice
white
and
that
stood
up
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
then
get
the
right
class.
justice
white
then
get
the
right
class.
justice
white
well,
in
the
long
run,
it
would
have
to
be
a
class
of
people
who
relied.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
you're
still
going
to
have
to
put
in
some
evidence.
justice
white
that
would
make
these
statements
material.
evidence
that
would
indicate
materiality--
