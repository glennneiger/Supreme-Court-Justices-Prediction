mr.
joel
w.
sternman
justice
brennan
and
may
it
please
the
court.
over
the
years,
private
claims
for
damages
under
section
10b
have
proliferated.
at
one
time
or
another,
countless
publicly
held
companies
have
been
charged
with
wrong
doing.
when
investors
find
the
market
moving
against
their
positions,
they
often
wonder
whether
the
price
they
paid
was
higher
than
it
should
have
been,
or
the
price
that
they
received
was
lower
than
it
should
have
been.
some,
such
as
respondents
in
this
case,
elect
to
sue
to
see
whether
any
corporate
wrong
doing
contributed
to
their
financial
misfortune.
this
case
began
in
june,
1979.
essentially,
respondents
contend
that
three
statements
issued
by
basic
were
materially
false
and
misleading
insofar
as
they
claimed
to
have
denied
the
existence
of
merger
negotiations
when
in
fact
merger
negotiations
were
on
going.
the
fact
is
that
the
statements
at
issue
which
are
the
key
to
this
case,
as
are
the
contacts
between
basic
and
c.e.
but
the
statements
did
not
themselves
deny
merger
negotiations
in
the
sense
that
respondents
claim.
the
three
statements,
the
first
one
issued
in
october,
1977,
was
issued
by
the
company
because
a
rumor
had
been
present
in
the
marketplace
that
basic
was
having
discussions
with
a
company
called
flintkote.
basic
determined
that
that
rumor
had
no
foundation.
whatever
discussions
it
had
were
not
leading
to
a
merger
with
flintkote,
and
as
a
result,
it
properly
issued
a
prompt
statement
to
deny
that
it
was
having
any
discussions
with
flintkote.
that
statement
says,
the
rumors
as
to
flintkote
are
inaccurate
and
we're
having
no
merger
negotiations
with
anybody.
the
second
and
the
third
statements
don't
even
refer
to
merger
negotiations.
they're
issued
in
september,
1978,
and
in
november,
1978.
the
earlier
statement
is
to
the
effect
that
the
company
is
unaware
of
any
reasons
for
unusual
trading
activity
in
its
stock,
and
there
are
no
corporate
developments
that
would
account
for
it.
the
november
statement
is
essentially
an
echo
of
the
september
statement
and
was
issued
by
the
company
in
an
effort
to
insure
that
its
shareholders
who
might
not
have
seen
the
september
statement
which
was
part
of
a
press
release
would
become
aware
of
the
substance
of
the
november
statement
which
was
included
in
a
report
to
shareholders.
no,
during
this
period,
beginning
even
prior
to
the
first
statement,
basic
had
been
approached
by
an
executive
from
combustion
engineering
who
had
made
very
clear
to
basic
that
he
had
an
interest
in
seeing
whether
a
possible
acquisition
of
basic
could
be
made.
combustion
had
a
line
of
business
that
was
very
similar
to
the
business
that
basic
was
engaged
in.
that
was
the
refractories
business.
so,
on
four
occasions
between
september,
1976
and
the
issuance
of
the
first
statement
in
october,
1977,
this
individual
who
would
go
to
cleveland,
ohio,
at
times
to
deal
with
other
businesses
that
combustion
had,
would
contact
representatives
of
basic,
would
have
lunch
with
them,
and
would
say,
i'm
interested
in
your
company,
i
would
like
to
see
an
acquisition
made,
can
we
do
something,
are
you
interested.
the
basic
representatives
told
him
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
they
were
not
interested,
that
they
desired
to
remain
independent.
they
were
polite.
they
did
have
lunch
with
this
individual,
but
nothing
came
of
it.
and
at
the
time
the
october,
1977
statement
was
issued
concerning
the
flintkote
rumor,
they
had
had
only
brief
contact
with
this
individual.
similarly,
in
the
period
between
october
1977
and
september
1978,
they
had
only
three
more
in-person
visits
by
mr.
kelly
who
was
the
combustion
engineering
representative.
significantly,
two
of
those
visits
concerned
an
interest
that
basic
had
developed
in
acquiring
the
refractories
division
of
combustion
engineering.
basic
decided
that
it
might
be
of
interest
to
it
to
see
whether
c.e.
would
be
willing
to
sell
that
division.
mr.
kelly
agreed
to
provide
certain
information.
meetings
were
held,
one
in
february,
1978;
another
one
in
march,
1978.
and
finally,
in
june,
basic
proposed
that
it
acquire
combustion's
refractories
division.
mr.
kelly
said
no,
but
what
if
i
were
to
suggest
to
c.e.
that
it
make
an
offer
to
acquire
basic
for
$28
a
share.
the
basic
individual
said,
we
wouldn't
be
interested,
but
if
we
were,
that
would
be
too
low
a
price.
the
individuals
had
occasional
telephone
contacts
during
the
balance
of
june
and
july,
1978,
and
then
mr.
kelly
stopped
calling.
no
word
was
heard
from
him
during
august
or
september
or
october
and
november,
with
the
exception
of
one
brief
telephone
call
that
he
made
in
september
when
he
became
aware
as
did
the
rest
of
the
public
that
basic
had
issued
a
statement
denying
any
knowledge
of
reasons
for
unusual
trading
activities
in
its
shares.
so
it
is
an
extreme
claim
to
assert
that
statements
such
as
these
issued
by
basic
in
these
circumstances
were
false
and
misleading.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
xx,
they
have
suggested
that.
i
think
the
sec
has
suggested
it
as
well.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
i
think
that
it
would
do
a
disservice
to
the
investment
community
to
encourage
companies
to
say,
no
comment,
when
in
fact
in
good
faith
they
determine
that
whatever
the
market
is
doing
with
their
stock
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything
that's
going
on
with
the
company.
judge
friendly
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
texas
gulf
said
that
there
would
be
a
danger
of
encouraging
corporate
silence
if
we
with
hindsight
permitted
section
10(b)
claims
to
be
brought
against
companies
who
in
good
faith
attempt
to
provide
information
to
the
marketplace.
a
no
comment
response
frequently
is
taken
as
an
indication
that
something
is
going
on,
in
any
event.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
the
court
of
appeals,
although
on
rehearing,
i
think
one
of
the
judges
on
that
panel
indicated
that
all
they
did
was
find
that
there
were
issues
of
fact
that
precluded
its
affirming
the
summary
judgment
that
the
district
court
had
awarded
to
petitioners,
did
seem
to
describe
all
of
the
statements
as
false
and
misleading.
they
somehow
formed
the
view
that
companies
can
spend
27
months
from
the
first.
kelly
contact
in
october
1976,
to
the
actual
agreement
that
was
reached
at
the
end
of
the
elapse
period
in
december,
1978,
pursuing
on-going
merger
negotiations,
actively
having
management,
investment
bankers
and
outside
counsel
of
the
company
engaged
for
27
months
in
negotiations.
the
fact
is
that
the
outside
counsel
here
never
even
met
during
the
class
period.
the
investment
bankers
that
the
company's
retained--
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
implicit
issues
in
this
case
involves
the
guidance
that
this
court
should
give
following
matsushita
to
courts
of
appeals
when
they're
confronted
with
a
decision
such
as
the
one
entered
by
the
district
court
here,
entered
on
summary
judgment.
there
had
been
20
depositions
taken
in
this
case.
there
was
an
sec
investigation,
and
there
were
numerous
transcripts
that
were
provided
to
the
respondents.
in
their
opposing
our
motion
in
the
district
court,
they
submitted
practically
every
transcript
and
inundated
the
district
judge
with
all
of
this
materials.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
standard
of
review,
the
de
novo
standard
that
was
applied
in
this
case
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
is
subject
to
criticism.
they
did
not
make
any
effort
to
deal
with
the
district
court's
opinion,
to
explain
why
he
was
in
error
in
concluding
that
there
were
no
issues
of
fact.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
that's
correct.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
the
district
court
opinion
had
three
aspects
to
it.
the
first
part
was
that--
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
--either
one
of
the
three
aspects
was
dispositive,
justice
white.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
that's
correct.
i
mean,
if
the
district--
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
--the
district
court's
standard
had
been
as
long
as
the
discussions
have
not
proceeded
to
the
point
where
it's
reasonably
certain
that
there
will
be
an
agreement
in
principle,
the
facts
are
not
material.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
that's
correct.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
except
the
district
court
did
much
more.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
we
had
presented
the
issue
to
it,
however,
in
three
steps,
as
rule
10(b)(5)
permits
us
to.
our
first
was
that
there
was
no
issue
of
fact
as
to
the
accuracy
of
the
statements.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
they
were
not
false,
they
were
not
misleading.
our
second
position
was
xx
in
some
respect
they
might
have
been
inaccurate...
and
there
is
an
issue
xx
to
that...
they
were
not
materially
misleading
because
the
discussions
between
the
companies
had
not
progressed
to
the
point
where
they
should
be
viewed
as
material
information
that
rendered
the
statements
materially
misleading.
and
finally
we
also
argued,
and
the
district
judge
agreed,
that
there
was
no
scienter
here.
we
could
win
and
did
win
on
each
of
those
three
points.
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
was
to
the
effect
that
the
district
judge
was
wrong
on
all
of
them,
and
i
think
it
was
critical--
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
--well,
on
the
questions
of
law
that
are
directly
before
this
court,
the
legal
principles.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
i
was
responding
to
a
question
that
i
thought--
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
--well,
i
think
in
order
to
apply
the
standards
of
materiality
that
have
been
proposed,
some
of
them
require
that
a
few
of
the
facts
be
xx.
the
first
standard
and
the
one
that
we
espouse
is
the
agreement
in
principle
test.
and
you're
right
there,
justice
white,
that
if
the
agreement
in
principle
test
is
adopted,
then
it
matters
not
what
the
facts
were
because
there's
no
question
that
at
the
time,
any
of
these
statements
were
issued,
there
was
not
an
agreement
in
principle
that
had
been
reached
between
the
parties.
the
respondents
did
not
claim
that.
the
sixth
circuit
did
not
find
that.
so
that
is
a
narrow
question
of
law
that
can
be
resolved
by
this
court
independently
of
viewing
the
record.
however,
as
justice
o'connor
indicated
there
are
other
tests
that
have
been
suggested.
and
the
most
recent
version
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
test
is
that
the
discussions
have
progressed
to
the
point
that
there
is
a
significantly
increased
possibility
of
a
value
effecting
acquisition.
i
think
i've
gotten
it
right.
there
it
would
be
necessary
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
issue
of
fact
that
would
preclude
summary
judgment
for
the
petitioners
on
the
state
that
those
discussions
had
progressed
to.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
various
facts.
there's
no
insider
trading
that
was
alleged
in
this
case.
there
were
no
rumors
in
the
marketplace
that
basic
was
having
any
discussions
with
combustion
engineering.
there
was
no
authorization
that
mr.
kelly
had
to
make
an
offer
on
behalf
of
combustion
engineering
at
any
point
during
the
class
period.
there
were
very
few
contacts
between
the
parties
over
the
class
period.
through
much
of
it,
basic
was
interested
in
making
an
acquisition
of
combustion,
and
not
the
reverse.
those
are
undisputed
facts
in
our
view,
and
the
court
of
appeals
glossed
over
them
and
created
a
scenario
that
made
it
appear
as
if,
at
the
same
time
basic
was
issuing
statements
in
one
room,
it
was
sitting
in
another
room
with
representatives--
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
--yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
yes.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
that's
correct.
you
can't
have
a
false
statement
that
is
not
materially
false
and
would
not
lead
to
exposure
to
this
kind
of
damage.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
if
you
accept
the
agreement
in
principle
test.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
that's
correct.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
that's
correct.
but
if
instead
of
accepting
the
agreement
in
principle
test,
you
find
more
attractive
the
test
that
the
sec
has
offered,
its
very
important
to
us
to
persuade
you
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
correct,
even
under
that
test,
that
in
effect,
the
district
court's
standard
was
foreshadowing
the
sec's
standard
that's
now
advocated.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
well,
i
think,
as
in
hochfelder
where
this
court
felt
it
was
appropriate
not
to
remand
but
instead
to
give
judgment
to
the
respondents
in
that
case
because
the
matter
had
been
litigated
enough.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
yes.
i
would
as
the
court
that
when
it
remands
to
the
sixth
circuit,
it
do
so
with
directions
that
it
reinstate
that
summary
judgment
order.
this
case
was
brought
in
june,
1979,
and
these
issues
have
been
fleshed
out
between
the
parties
for
a
very
long
time.
and
we
think
that
certainly
under
the
agreement
in
principle
test,
they
would
have
no
discretion.
but
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
one
of
the
other
tests,
we
think
that
its
review
of
the
record
will
convince
it
that
the
discussions
here
were
never
advanced
to
the
point
that
even
under
the
sec's
test--
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
--yes.
but
i
would
hope
the--
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
--yes,
justice
brennan,
that's
correct.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
test
which
no
one
has
defended
simply
states
that
xx
there
is
an
inaccuracy
in
a
statement,
it
renders
the
undisclosed
information
material.
and
as
the
sec
notes
in
its
amicus
brief,
that
removes
the
element
of
materiality
completely
from
the
mix.
and
everything
becomes
material,
even
the
most
trivial
statement.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
stated
if
there
were
but
one
telephone
call
from
kelly,
that
would
be
sufficient.
it's
interesting
that
it
also
read
the
statements
as
if
they
were
false
statements.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
yes,
that
was
their
view.
now,
the
other
issue
that
is
before
the
court
involves
the
fraud
on
the
market
theory
that
has
been
used
by
courts
to
facilitate
class
certification
in
actions
under
section
10(b).
we
have
argued
that
the
only
case
in
which
this
court
has
even
approached
anything
that's
come
lower
courts
feel
relates
to
that
theory
is
the
affiliated
ute
case.
and
there
is
nothing
in
affiliated
ute
which
involved
a
face
to
face
transaction
and
omissions,
rather
than
misstatements,
and
a
need
to
shift
an
evidentiary
burden,
that
provides
any
justification
for
fraud
on
the
market
theory.
lower
courts,
however,
have
concluded
that
it
is
good
policy
to
abandon
the
traditional
xx
requirement
under
section
10(b)
and
instead
to
replace
it
with
what
they
call
reliance
on
the
integrity
of
the
market,
something
that
is
derived
from
the
efficient
market
hypothesis,
a
hypothesis
that
many
people
have
questioned
in
light
of
the
events
of
the
last
few
weeks.
but
in
a
recent
fifth
circuit
decision
in
the
finkel
case,
they
pointed
out
that
even
if
you
accept
the
fraud
on
the
market
theory
for
some
cases,
you
should
not
accept
it
for
a
case
such
as
ours,
which
is
a
10(b)(5)(b)
case,
that
is,
a
case
that
involves
misleading
statements,
rather
than
omissions.
to
the
extent
this
court
continues
to
believe
that
section
10(b)
and
rule
10(b)(5)
have
their
origins
in
a
more
common
law
type
fraud
situation,
the
element
of
reliance
has
to
be
respected
and
should
be
reinstated.
it
is
misleading,
i
think,
for
some
to
argue
that
reliance
is
there.
it's
there
in
forms
of
a
rebuttable
presumption.
the
presumption
of
reliance
effectively
cannot
be
rebutted.
people
are
confronted
with
enormous
class
actions.
the
class
in
this
case
consists
of
persons
who
traded
two
million
shares
over
a
fourteen-month
period.
they
claim
damages
of
many
tens
of
millions
of
dollars.
they
didn't
trade
with
the
petitioners.
they
sold
into
the
open
market.
any
damage
that
they
claim
to
have
suffered
did
not
arise
from
any
benefit
that
any
of
the
petitioners
received.
if
they
feel
they
were
misinformed,
which
we
claim
they
were
not,
other
innocent
market
participants
received
an
offsetting
benefit
from
the
lack
of
information
in
the
marketplace.
if
a
case
such
as
this
is
proper
for
certification
as
a
class
action,
the
class
should
be
limited
to
those
who
can
show
that
they
relied
upon
the
statements
in
making
their
investment
decisions.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
it
doesn't
require
knowledge
of?
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
that's
correct.
it
permits
people
who
sold
because
they
had
to
send
their
children
to
college
and
had
no
idea
of
any
statements.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
that's
correct.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
yes.
and
i
think
in
terms
of
some
of
the
earlier
decisions,
that
it
substitutes
loss
causation
for
transaction
causation.
that
it
is
enough
for
someone
who
traded
in
the
impersonal
market
to
recover
if
he
has
incurred
what
he
views
as
a
loss,
even
though
his
transaction
was
not
influenced
in
any
way
by
the
wrong
doing
that
he
claims
the
defendants
are
responsible
for.
this
results
in
the
aggregation
of
enormous
groups
of
people,
enormous
classes,
and
we
think
violates
the
rule's
enabling
act,
as
well,
because
it
changes
the
ball
game
when
you're
confronted
with
a
class
action.
you
cannot
get
a
summary
judgment
on
the
issue
of
reliance.
it's
a
non-issue.
it's
presumed
in
favor
of
the
respondents.
you
cannot
defeat
a
class
action
motion
by
claiming
that
the
predominance
requirement
is
not
met
under
rule
23(b)(3).
it
reads
the
predominance
requirement
out
of
the
rule.
it
reflects
a
policy
that
class
actions
are
good,
that
corporations
are
evil,
and
that
anything
that
can
be
done
to
circumvent...
and
this
is
in
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals...
to
circumvent
the
predominance
requirement
of
rule
23(b)(3)
and
to
facilitate
class
actions,
is
something
that
should
be
done.
that,
in
our
view,
is
unsound
policy
and
unsound
law.
we
also
think
in
this
case
that
even
if
the
fraud
on
the
market
theory
were
not
rejected
on
its
face
by
this
court,
that
nevertheless
its
application
in
this
case
should
be
reversed.
this
is
a
seller's
class
action.
most
class
actions
are
purchaser's
class
actions.
this
does
not
xx
a
company
that
has
made
a
historical
misstatement
xx
its
earnings
or
some
significant
event.
it
involves
misleading
statements
because
a
company
was
having
preliminary
merger
contacts.
the
case
involves
a
fourteen-month
class
period.
the
claim
is
that
everyone
who
sold
during
tis
period
can
be
represented
by
the
respondents.
for
all
of
those,
none
of
the
fraud
on
the
market
cases
has
arisen
in
a
situation
such
as
that.
where
historical
events
are
misrepresented
and
there
is
a
market
impact,
perhaps
courts
are
attracted
by
the
logic
of
believing
that
everyone
who
purchased
a
stock
that
was
artificially
inflated
should
be
able
to
join
a
group
and
bring
a
class
action.
but
these
statements
logic
would
dictate
in
our
view
had
no
market
impact
or
a
minimal
market
impact,
perhaps
a
few
days.
the
lower
courts
believe
that
it
was
appropriate
not
to
look
at
the
question
of
impact.
it
was
alleged,
they
claimed,
therefore
it
can
be
assumed.
so
it
thrusts
this
conditional
certification
upon
the
parties
at
a
very
early
point
in
the
litigation
and
its
hangs
over
everyone's
head
until
the
trial
has
taken
place
on
the
merits,
and
then
after
the
trial,
an
opportunity
is
given
to
try
to
rebut
that
presumption.
well,
in
many
respects,
that
opportunity
is
just
not
going
to
be
something
that
litigants
are
going
to
wait
for.
the
risk
is
too
great
and
the
imbalance
that
results
in
securities
litigation
from
having
a
fraud
on
the
market
theory
and
class
certification
that's
loosely
granted,
plus
ease
in
denying
summary
judgment,
plus
something
that
renders
material
just
about
anything
exposes
defendants
in
the
securities
marketplace
to
enormous
liability
and
enormous
risks,
and
we
think
ends
up
in
creating
a
risk
of
windfall
settlements
that
ultimately
hurt
american
businesses
and
investors
in
those
businesses.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
thank
you,
justice
brennan.
in
many
respects,
this
case
represents
hindsight
run
rampant.
there
was
an
agreement
that
was
reached
between
basic
and
combustion
in
december,
1978.
there
was
disclosure
that
at
the
time
the
agreement
documents
were
publicized
that
the
companies
had
had
discussions
for
the
prior
27-month
period.
this
lawsuit
followed.
and
the
attempt
to
take
the
fact
that
there
was
an
agreement
and
that
there
had
been
contacts
during
a
27-month
period
and
then
to
convert
that
into
making
three
statements
misleading
does
not
stand
up
under
the
record.
there
was
a
reference
by
the
respondents
to
there
being
dozens
of
contacts
before
the
first
statement
was
issued.
in
our
reply
brief,
at
xx
and
xx
identify
each
and
every
meeting
that
the
parties
had
during
the
class
period.
and
it
comes
to
four
meetings
before
the
first
statement,
three
before
the
second
statement
and
none
before
the
third.
and
we
describe
those
meetings
these
were
not
negotiations.
it's
a
distortion
of
the
english
language
to
call
an
attempt
by
an
executive
of
a
company
to
see
whether
another
company
might
be
interested
negotiations
that
render
statements
false
and
misleading.
second,
we
should
make
it
clear
that
the
district
court
did
not
require
that
there
be
a
deal
before
the
statements
would
be
materially
misleading.
all
that
it
required
was
that
there
be
negotiations
destined
with
reasonable
certainty
to
become
a
merger
agreement
in
principle,
or
negotiations
which
might
imminently
produce
an
agreement
in
principle.
it's
our
argument
that
at
no
point
during
the
class
period
did
these
contacts
between
mr.
kelly
and
the
people
at
basic
ever
approach
the
level
of
that
definition,
or
approach
the
level
of
the
significantly
increased
possibility
formulation
that
the
sec
has
used.
primarily,
we
advocate
adoption
by
this
court
of
the
agreement
in
principle
test.
it
has
been
used
over
the
years
by
all
of
the
lower
courts
in
dealing
with
non-disclosure
cases.
cases
in
which
no
statements
are
made
and
persons
who
trade
on
the
open
market
claiming
that
they
would
not
have
sold
shares
had
they
known
that
the
company
was
having
discussion.
the
courts
uniformly
have
held
in
those
cases
that
that
information
is
not
material
and
did
not
have
to
be
disclosed.
and
all
that's
happened
in
the
greenfield
case
is
that
that
court
has
said
that
that
test
that
courts
have
been
using
for
years
in
the
non-disclosure
area
was
an
appropriate
one
when
a
statement
such
as
the
statements
here
have
been
issued.
the
agreement
in
principle
test
also
provides
a
bright
line
so
that
corporations
that
are
the
subject
of
a
stock
exchange
inquiry
as
to
rumors
in
its
stock
can
know
that
if
they
do
as
basic
did
here,
seek
to
disclosed
accurate
information,
that
they
will
not
be
vulnerable
to
the
type
of
litigation
that
was
brought
here
because
it's
going
to
be
claimed
that
there
were
issues
of
fact
as
to
whether
there
were
material
negotiations
preceding.
there's
been
reference
to
the
chilling
effect.
that
is
another
policy
benefit
that
the
agreement
in
principle
test
provides.
it
will
not
require
premature
disclosure
of
negotiations
which
traditionally
have
caused
acquiring
corporations
to
leave,
not
to
want
to
pursue
a
possible
acquisition
because
the
price
of
the
company
stock
increases
and
there's
no
longer
an
economic
benefit
for
the
acquisition.
premature
disclosure
under
a
test
other
than
the
agreement
in
principle
standard
also
is
damaging
to
executive
and
employees
moral
at
companies.
people
who
have
xx
corporations
do
not
want
to
hear
that
someone
has
approached
that
there
may
be
a
possible
takeover.
they're
going
to
start
looking
for
other
jobs.
and
any
policy
that
is
going
to
require
very
early
disclosure
of
the
types
of
contacts
that
were
had
here
is
going
to
have
a
devastating
effect
on
employee
and
corporate
morale.
premature
disclosure
also
runs
the
risk
of
putting
a
company
into
play.
basic
had
absolutely
no
desire
to
be
acquired.
it
recognized
that
it
had
an
obligation
to
its
shareholders
to
listen
to
offers.
had
it
made
a
statement
in
october,
1977,
that
we've
been
approached
by
company
x,
we're
not
interested
but
this
representative
of
company
x
said
he
might
recommend
an
offer,
the
raiders
and
the
corporate
vultures
would
be
out
there,
and
you'd
have
market
disruption
in
basic
as
well
as
all
of
the
other
impacts
that
i've
referred
to.
one
other
point,
i
think,
has
to
be
made
very
clear.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
agreement
in
principle
test
should
be
applied
where
insider
trading
is
alleged.
that
is
not
what's
involved
in
this
case.
and
we
feel
that
the
sec's
reluctance
to
endorse
the
agreement
in
principle
test
reflects
a
concern
on
its
part
that
power
courts
will
blindly
apply
that
test
where
there's
insider
trading.
mr.
joel
w.
sternman
the
sales
data
was
given...
first
of
all,
in
1978,
when
there
was
some
sales
data
given,
basic
was
interested
in
acquiring
combustion's
refractories
division,
and
it
thought
that
it
would
pay
for
that
acquisition
with
basic
stock.
so
it
wanted
to
give
combustion
an
opportunity
to
take
a
look
at
what
basic
was
doing
and
what
that
stock
might
be
worth
if
such
an
acquisition
took
place.
but
in
1976,
the
basic
individual,
mr.
muller,
did
give
mr.
kelly
certain
confidential
information.
he
trusted
him.
that
information
was
solely
to
assist
mr.
kelly
to
see
what
he
was
going
to
do.
but
it
did
not,
as
the
district
court
noted
when
it
discussed
that,
create
any
negotiations
out
of
what
was
happening.
it
may
have
been
ill
advised.
it
may
have
been
indiscrete,
but
it
did
not
render
the
discussions
that
were
had
material.
