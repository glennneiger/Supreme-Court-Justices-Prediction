justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
next
case
is
basic,
incorporated
versus
levinson.
mr.
sternman,
any
time
you're
ready,
sir.
justice
jr.
mr.
sternman,
are
you
arguing
that
we
ought
to
find
a
different
testing
when
a
summary
judgment
is
permissible?
a
special
one
here?
justice
jr.
if
we
were
to
adopt
the
sec
test,
that
would
require
a
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
because
we'd
reject
the
court
of
appeals
test,
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
i
know
what
you
would
hope,
but
that's
a
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cross?
justice
jr.
mr.
cross,
having
set
aside
the
summary
judgment,
you're
now
going
back
to
trial,
are
you?
justice
jr.
in
the
district
court.
and
did
i
understand
you
to
say
earlier
the
standard
you'd
like
to
have
the
district
court
apply
would
be
the
northway
standard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cross.
ms.
sternman,
you
have
five
minutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
sternman.
the
case
is
submitted.
