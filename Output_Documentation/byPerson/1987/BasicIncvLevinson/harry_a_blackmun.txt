justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
securities
and
exchange
commissionâ€™s
rule
10b-5
prohibits
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security,
the
making
of
any
untrue
statement
of
a
material
fact
or
the
omission
of
the
material
fact.
in
1978,
basic
incorporated
and
another
firm
agreed
to
merge,
and
during
the
two
years
immediately
preceding
the
merger,
there
were
various
meetings
and
conversations
between
the
two
companies.
and
during
that
same
time,
however,
basic
made
three
public
statements
denying
that
merger
or
merger
negotiations
were
underway
or
that
in
knew
of
any
corporate
developments
that
would
account
for
heavy
trading
activity
in
its
stock.
the
respondents
are
former
basic
shareholders
who
sold
their
stock
between
the
first
public
denial
and
the
suspension
of
trading
in
basic's
stock
just
prior
to
the
merger
announcement.
and
they
filed
suite
against
basic
and
some
of
its
directors
alleging
that
the
statements
had
been
false
or
misleading
in
violation
of
section
10
of
the
1934
securities
exchange
act
and
of
the
rule
10b-5
and
that
they
had
been
injured
by
selling
their
shares
at
prices
artificially
depressed
by
those
statements.
the
district
court
certified
the
plaintiff's
class
but
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
defendants
on
the
merits.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
class
certification
but
reversed
the
summary
judgment
and
it
rejected
specifically
the
district
court's
view
of
the
preliminary
merger
discussions
were
immaterial
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
we
vacate
that
judgment
and
remand
the
case.
we
hold
that
the
standard
set
forth
in
a
case
recently
here
called
tsc
industries
whereby
an
omitted
fact
is
material
if
there
is
a
substantial
likelihood
that
its
disclosure
would
have
been
considered
significant
by
a
reasonable
investor
is
to
be
expressly
adopted
for
the
10-b
and
rule
10-b(5)
contexts.
we
reject
the
so-called
agreement-in-principle
test
under
which
preliminary
disclosure
does
not
become
material
until
the
would-be
merger
partners
have
reached
an
agreement
as
to
price
and
structure
of
the
transition.
materiality
in
the
merger
context
depends
on
the
probability
that
the
transaction
will
be
consummated
and
its
significance
to
the
issue
of
the
securities.
materiality
therefore
depends
on
the
facts
and
is
to
be
determined
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
the
courts
below
properly
applied
the
presumption
of
reliance
and
that
presumption
is
also
supported
by
common
sense
and
probability
in
our
view.
an
investor
who
trades
stock
at
the
price
set
by
an
impersonal
market
does
so
on
the
reliance
on
the
integrity
of
that
price.
and
because
most
publicly
available
information
is
reflected
in
market
price,
an
investor's
reliance
on
any
public
material
representations
may
be
presumed
for
purposes
of
a
rule
10-b(5)
action.
but
that
presumption
of
reliance,
however,
may
be
rebutted.
