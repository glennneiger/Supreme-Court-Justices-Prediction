mr.
wayne
alan
cross
justice
brennan,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
august
10
of
this
year,
barron's
magazine
titled
its
article
about
this
case,
"is
it
okay
to
lie"?
and
i
hesitate
to
oversimplify
in
that
kind
of
journalistic
way,
but
i
really
think
that's
what's
at
issue
here.
i
don't
think
notwithstanding
the
extensive
discussion
of
the
facts
that
the
petitioners
seriously
claim
that
the
reasonable
investor
articulated
by
this
court
in
tsc
v.
northway,
could
not
have
considered
the
discussions
between
basic
and
combustion
significant
to
their
investment
decisions.
they
try
to
minimize
the
extent
of
those
contacts,
but
the
suggestion
that
a
jury,
there's
not
enough
evidence
of
those
contacts
that
a
jury
could
not
conclude
that
a
reasonable
investor
would
find
it
interesting,
significant,
alter
the
mix
of
information
available
to
them
in
deciding
that
a
buyer
sells
securities.
that
is
not
a
serious
suggestion,
i
submit.
i
submit
that
what
is
really
at
issue
in
this
case
and
at
issue
in
the
agreement
in
principle
articulation
by
the
petitioners
is
a
statement
that
for
reasons
of
corporate
efficiency,
corporate
ease,
corporate
convenience,
companies
are
free
to
say
virtually
anything
they
want
to
say
about
the
state
of
merger
negotiations
up
until
the
time
that
there's
an
agreement
in
principle,
which
means
an
agreement
on
price
and
structure.
in
the
practical
world,
agreement
on
price
and
structure
are
typically
reached
the
day
the
merger
is
announced,
perhaps
the
night
before
late
at
night.
typically
the
investment
bankers
sit
down
at
the
very
last
minute
and
discuss
price,
go
to
their
respective
boards
of
directors
with
a
recommendations
frequently
in
writing
saying
do
it.
up
until
that
point
in
time,
you
do
not
have
what
they
call
an
agreement
in
principle.
they
are
suggesting
that
a
rule
be
adopted
by
this
court
that
at
any
time
prior
to
that
no
matter
how
developed
the
negotiations
are,
no
matter
how
committed
the
people
are,
you
can
say
anything
you
want
to
say.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
that
i
believe
is
the
third
circuit
rule,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
the
only
other
circuit
that
has
addressed
that
issue,
and
i
believe
at
least
you
can
say
it's
ambiguous,
is
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
flamm
case.
talks
about
the
agreement
in
principle
issue
and
agrees
with
it
in
the
context
of
a
non-disclosure
context
where
there's
silence.
when
asked
to
decide
that
the
flamm
case
was
really,
citing
our
case,
a
levinson
misstatement
case,
and
not
a
silence
case,
the
seventh
circuit
says
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
because
we
don't
think
there
was
deception
here.
the
statements
made
in
that
case
the
seventh
circuit
concluded
did
not--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--the
agreement
in
principle
test,
i'm
not
aware
that
any
other
circuit
has
addressed
it
squarely.
the
seventh
circuit
did
address
the
issue
on
reconsideration
in
the
miner
case.
they
had
originally
made
a
comment
that
seemed
to
follow
the
decision
in
the
third
circuit.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
that's
correct.
and
the
agreement
in
principle
test
is,
i
submit,
asking
for
a
license
to
distort
or
freedom
to
distort.
we're
not
talking
here
about
statements
that
are
ambiguous
about
the
intent.
the
first
statement
issued
in
this
case
said
no
negotiations
were
underway
with
any
company
for
a
merger.
that's
as
unambiguous
as
you
can
say
it.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
your
honor,
i
think
the
sec
test
is
very
close
to
the
sixth
circuit
test
and
i
think
very
close
to
most
of
the
other
circuits.
all
the
sec
was
trying
to
do
in
its
brief,
i
believe,
was
articulate
some
standard
of
materiality
rather
than
simply
saying
a
jury
has
to
consider
what
might
be
important.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
no.
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that's
what
the
sixth
circuit
said.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
well,
the
interpretation
the
sec
has
taken
and
i
understand
that.
i
disagree
with
it.
i
think
that
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--i
don't
say
that
any,
the
denial
of
a
merger
negotiation
makes
any
contact
per
se
material,
no,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
sixth
circuit
meant
to
say.
there
is
a
reading
of
some
of
the
language
that
says
that.
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
was
saying
that
the
tsc
standard,
that
a
reasonable
investor
has
to
evaluate
the
information
available
and
i
think
they
were
saying
in
this
case,
the
denial
made
these
statements
material.
the
sixth
circuit
said
in
their
view
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
is
inconceivable
that
a
reasonable
investor
wouldn't
consider
these
contacts
significant.
we're
not
talking
about
preliminary
premature
feelers
by
brokers
or
suggestions
of
interest.
we're
talking
about
contacts
in
which
the
top
executives
of
both
companies
met
dozens
of
times,
devoted
hundreds
of
hours.
most
significantly,
they
were
exchanging
their
confidential
earnings
data
and
projections.
had
they
not
had
an
interest,
a
mutual
interest,
not
a
unilateral
interest
in
this
merger,
they
would
have
been
breaching
their
fiduciary
obligations
to
their
shareholders.
the
basic
management
was
giving
away
their
five-year
projections
for
earnings,
their
product
plans.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
the
district
court,
your
honor,
the
district
court's
opinion
is
a
very
curious
opinion.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
it
disagreed
but
it
didn't
disagree
that
the
evidence
was
there.
if
you
read
the
district
court
opinion,
clearly,
it
is
shot
full
of
statements
that
plaintiff
put
forward
evidence
of
the
following.
defendants
put
evidence
of
the
following.
xx
those
evidence,
i
find.
the
district
court
treated
this
motion
for
summary
judgment
as
if
it
were
a
bench
trial.
the
opinion
is
loaded
with,
i
find.
xx
i
conclude.
on
balance,
it's
more
credible
that.
if
you
read
the
opinion
carefully,
there
are
dozens
of
findings.
this
is
not
a
bench
trial,
this
is
a
summary
judgment
motion.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
i
think
the
district
court
concluded
that
with
respect
to
the
first
statement,
there
are
not
any
negotiations
underway
for
any
company
for
a
merger
statement,
that
it
concluded
that
the
contacts
prior
to
that
statement
were
not
cognizable
as
"negotiations"
and
hence
the
statement
was
true.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
but
that's
a
characterization
of
what
is
a
negotiation.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
the
other
statements,
i
believe,
the
district
court
conceded
there
was
a
possibility
that
the
contacts
prior
to
the
september,
november
statements
could
be
considered
preliminary
merger
negotiations.
it
concluded
once
again
that
because
they
were
preliminary,
they
were
not
negotiations
and
then
began
xx
over
into
this
agreement
in
principle
test
that
it
articulates,
that
it
was
prior
to
any
deal
being
consummated,
and
because
in
the
view
the
deal
being
consummated
was
determinative
of
materiality,
they
were
not
untrue.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that's
not
right.
i
think
what
those
cases
is
that
projections,
and
particularly
earnings
projections
which
are
speculative
in
nature
and
uncertain,
that
there
is
no
duty
to
disclose
such
projections.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
well,
first
of
all,
the
no
corporate
development
statement
is
not
as
neutral
as
it
sounds.
that
statement
is
taken
from
the
new
york
stock
exchange
manual,
in
a
section
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
manual
in
which
it
says
when
there
are
rumors
of
the
possibility
of
a
merger
or
acquisition,
it
is
necessary
that
corporate
management
speak
out
definitively,
clearly,
and
truthfully.
if
they
are
not
true,
a
statement
that
the
company
is
aware
of
no
pending
or
present
corporate
development
to
explain
the
trading
is
appropriate.
they
are
code
words
for
saying,
no
merger.
so
that
it
is
not
simply
an
analytical
equivalent
as
suggested
in
the
reply
brief
of
a
no
comment
statement.
it
is
the
same
thing
as
the
first
statement
here,
there
are
no
negotiations
for
a
merger.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
that's
right.
no
comment
is
true.
or
silence
is
true.
or,
as
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
the
more
common
practice--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--no.
none
of
your
business,
i
think,
is
the
equivalent
of,
no
comment.
but
as
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
have
dozens
of
examples,
the
more
common
practice
in
the
investment
community
is
to
speak
the
truth.
that's
the
unusual
part
about
this
case.
there's
this
conundrum
of
what's
true,
what's
false.
you
know,
is
it
material,
is
it
premature.
what's
wrong
with
truth?
what
most
corporate
management
does,
when
confronted
with
a
direct
question,
are
you
discussing
merger
or
not,
if
they're
not,
they
say,
no.
if
they
are,
they
say
we
have
been
approached
by
a
company.
it
has
expressed
an
interest
in
acquiring
us.
we
have
entered
into
preliminary
negotiations
and
it's
too
early
to
tell
where
we're
going.
and
there
are
dozens
of
those
statements
issued
every
month.
we've
got
about
a
dozen
in
our
brief
that's
in
the
record
in
the
district
court.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
saying
that.
it
has
the
virtue
of
telling
the
truth
and
informing
the
investment
public
of
what's
going
on.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
there
is
some
scholarly
writing.
i'm
not
aware
that
there's
any
judicial
writing
on
that
topic,
other
than
the
third
circuit.
and
it
may
be
that
there
is
a
chilling
effect,
but
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
a
deceptive
effect
of
denying.
we're
not
talking
about
a
no
comment
or
a
silence.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
that
may
be
as
a
matter
of
economies
true
but
i
submit
that
if
you
adopt
that
as
a
policy
reason
for
doing
that,
it
is
where
i
started
my
argument.
it
is
okay
to
lie?
it
is
asking
for
an
exception
to
rule
10(b)(5)
in
the
merger
context
that
it
is
possible,
indeed
appropriate,
to
lie.
to
say
we
are
not
having
a
merger
discussion,
when
you
are.
and
that
is
contrary
to
everything
that
both
of
the
securities
acts
have
enacted
and
particularly
contrary
to
10(b)(5).
rule
10(b)(5)
is
a
judge
made
rule
to
take
care
of
that
kind
of
deception.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
my
definition
of
materiality
would
be
this
court's
definition
in
tsc
v.
northway.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
would
the
discussions
at
the
time,
take
for
example,
the
october,
1977
denial,
would
the
discussions
that
had
existed
at
that
time
have
been
considered
important
to
the
investment
decision
of
the
reasonable
investor.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
well,
now
you're
shifting
over
into
the
fraud
on
the
market
theory.
but--
--xx
case,
i
don't
have
a
problem
with
reliance
because
all
xx
plaintiffs
testified
that
they
read
the
documents
with
the
light
on.
in
that
particular
case,
our
clients
will
take
the
stand
and
testify
that
they
relied.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
justice
o'connor,
that
is
the
ruling
of
the
district
court.
we
moved
for
class
certification
based
on
reliance,
in
the
alternative
fraud
on
the
market.
we
have
three
plaintiffs
who
relied.
we
believe
that
their
claims
are
common
to
other
claims
and
the
individual
questions
of
reliance
do
not
predominant.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
the
district
court,
in
certifying
the
class,
chose
our
second
alternative
articulation
of
a
reason
for
class
certification,
and
said,
in
this
case,
fraud
on
the
market
is
sufficient
to
certify
a
class
and
certified
it
that
way.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
and
that
stood
up
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
this
case,
i
believe,
given
the
certification
that
was
made,
we
do
not
have
to
affirmatively
prove
reliance.
we
have
to
defend
the
reliance
presumption
against
the
claims
that
the
fraud
did
not
have
an
impact
on
the
market,
of
its
claims
that
is
posited
by
mr.
sternman,
some
of
the
plaintiffs
class
members
may
have
traded
notwithstanding
any
impact
on
the
market,
for
example,
they
had
to
put
their
kids
through
school.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
the
only
objection
that
i
would
have
if
you
thought
that
reliance
had
to
be
established
would
be
the
right
to
relitigate
the
class
action
motion
in
the
district
court.
i
would
not
like
to
be
whipsawed
between
the
district
court
who
took
one
of
two
alternative
theories
and
certified,
and
a
supreme
court
that
says
that
theory
was
wrong,
and
leave
me
without
a
class,
which
i
think
is
a
possibility
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
the
district
court
could
properly
and
should
properly
have
certified
this
class
on
traditional
rule
23
grounds
that
individual
questions
did
not
predominate.
that
while
there
may
be
some
individual
questions
of
reliance,
they
were
clearly
subordinate
to
more
significant
questions
of
liability,
materiality,
damages,
all
of
which
are
common
to
the
class.
and
that
there
may
come
a
point
in
time
in
the
proceeding
where
the
individual
class
members
would
have
to
prove
reliance.
i
don't
think
that's
necessary.
i
think
the
fraud
on
the
market
theory
is
a
perfectly
viable
theory
that
should
not
be
overruled.
if
it
were
overruled
and
in
effect
said
that
that's
the
end
of
fraud
on
the
market,
the
only
thing
i
would
want
is
the
opportunity
to
relitigate
the
class
motion
in
the
district
court
so
i
don't
get
whipsawed.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
what?
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
well,
i
think
i
have
the
right
class.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
it
would
have
to
be
a
class
of
people
who
relied,
but
i
think
you
still
even
in
a
class
certification
context
under
rule
23,
you
still
have
a
presumption
of
reliance
of
non-present
class
members.
you
get
to
try
the
case
as
a
class
action.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
it
may
be
on
the
damage
phase,
you
get
some
inquiry.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
i
hope
so.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
that's
right.
or
possibly
the
northway
standard
as
modified
by
the
sec
standard.
the
sec
does
not
bother
me.
i
don't
think
it's
that
different
from
the
northway
standard.
i
think
all
the
sec
position
is
is
a
refinement
of
the
general
standard
of
materiality
of
northway
in
the
context
of
merger
negotiations.
and
i'm
perfectly
content
on
the
facts
of
this
case
with
a
substantially
increased
possibility
of
a
value-enhancing
acquisition,
i'm
perfectly
content
with
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
i've
got
chief
executive
officers
meeting
with
each
other,
talking
to
their
lawyers
about
antitrust
considerations,
hiring
investment
bankers
to
perform
valuations,
giving
away
their
most
confidential
information
prior
to
the
time
any
one
of
these
statements
is
made.
and
i'm
perfectly
content
to
be
able
to
say
that
a
jury
could
conclude
that
those
facts
indicated
the
possibility
of
an
acquisition.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
your
honor,
i'm
intrigued
by
the
opinion
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
--i
think
that
on
the
face
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was,
in
effect,
summary
judgment
on
the
materiality
issue
was
appropriate
for
me.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
not
as
mr.
sternman
has
argued
that
it's
articulating
a
rule
of
law
for
all
cases.
but
that
simply
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
contacts
were
so
substantial
that
there
is
not
a
reasonable
investor
in
the
world
who
wouldn't
consider
them
material.
and
the
intriguing
thing
is
that
the
dissenting
judge
on
rehearing
said,
no,
i
didn't
mean
that,
and
the
other
two
judges
stood
silent.
mr.
sternman
placed
the
question
in
issue
on
his
petition
for
reconsideration
saying
basically,
you've
established
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
on
the
materiality
issue.
two
of
the
judges
said
nothing,
and
one
judge
came
back
and
said,
no,
i
didn't.
so
i'm
intrigued
by
it.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
i
would
argue
and
i
would
argue
notwithstanding
the
sixth
circuit
opinion,
i
would
argue
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict
on
that
issue,
and
well
get
all
the
evidence
in.
that
there
is
not
any
question
of
fact
that
these
contacts
are
so
significant
in
this
case,
quite
the
reverse
of
there
being
no
evidence.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
i
think
as
a
matter
of
pure
jurisprudence
i
can't
take
that
position
because
i
didn't
make
the
motion.
if
i'd
made
the
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
that
opinion,
i
would
take
that
position,
but
i
didn't
make
it.
i
may.
and
i
may
argue
judicial
estoppel
based
on
mr.
sternman's
briefs
in
this
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
i
don't
think
i'll
take
the
position
that
that
opinion
binds
the
district
court
as
a
sure
matter
of
jurisprudence.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
i
think
i'm
going
to
have
to
put
in
some
evidence,
yes.
mr.
wayne
alan
cross
yes.
i'm
going
to
put
in
the
record
on
the
contacts
between
the
companies,
the
intensity
of
negotiation,
and
i
believe
that
that
evidence
will
make
the
statements
material
as
a
matter
of
law.
at
a
minimum,
i'm
certainly
entitled
to
a
jury
verdict
on
the
issue.
i'd
like
to
make
one
comment
about
the
fraud
on
the
market
theory.
there's
a
suggestion
that
runs
through
the
petitioner's
brief
and
through
a
number
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
somehow
the
fraud
on
the
market
theory
has
eliminated
the
reliance
requirement
in
10(b)(5)
actions.
i
don't
read
it
that
way
and
i
don't
think
any
of
the
circuit
courts
read
it
that
way.
i
think
what
the
fraud
on
the
market
theory
has
done,
it
has
judicially
modified
that
which
was
a
judicially
created
reliance
requirement.
this
court
indicated
in
affiliated
ute
that
in
the
context
of
10(b)(5),
the
reliance
requirement
was
not
immutable.
now,
i'm
not
arguing
that
affiliated
ute
governs
the
fraud
on
the
market
cases,
but
i
do
think
it
indicates
this
court
saying,
10(b)(5)
is
a
judicially
created
remedy
and
at
least
in
the
context
of
affiliated
ute,
the
reliance
requirement
can
be
relaxed.
the
second
circuit
ruled
in
the
penn-dixie
case
that
in
a
context
where
manipulation
affected
the
exchange
offer
price
in
a
merger
agreement,
that
there
was
no
investment
decision
necessary
because
the
merged
shareholders
didn't
have
a
choice.
they
just
got
a
bad
price
based
on
fraud.
that
in
that
context,
reliance
was
not
necessary.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
reliance
requirement
is
judicially
created,
it
can
be
judicially
modified,
and
i
think
that
all
the
circuit
courts
have
done
is
taken
a
requirement
of
direct
individual
reliance
and
imposed
an
indirect
reliance
requirement.
there's
no
suggestion
that
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
the
fraud.
the
suggestion
in
the
fraud
in
the
market
cases
is,
a)
that
the
efficient
market
reflects
the
fraud...
the
market
goes
up
or
down
based
on
the
fraud;
and
b)
people
in
making
trading
decisions
rely
upon
the
fact
that
the
price
at
which
they're
trading
is
a
fair
price.
there's
still
a
connection
between
the
fraud
of
the
defendants
and
the
injury
to
the
plaintiff
at
the
end.
it's
simply
that,
as
i
think
the
blackie
court
put
it,
the
fraud
on
the
market
theory
uses
the
market
as
the
analytical
agent
for
the
individual.
that
instead
of
sitting
down
and
pouring
over
the
documents
themselves
and
coming
to
a
conclusion
as
to
what
is
a
fair
price
based
on
all
of
the
information
available,
he
uses
the
marketplace
as
his
agent
for
that.
i
think
another
one
of
the
circuit
court's
called
it,
the
market
becomes
the
transmission
belt
for
conveyance
of
information
from
defendants
to
plaintiffs.
i
don't
think
that
the
fraud
in
the
market
theory
eliminates
reliance.
i
don't
think
it
does
great
violence
to
10(b)(5).
it
customizes
the
practicalities
in
10(b)(5)
xx
of
the
xx
involved
with
thousands,
sometimes
millions
xx
being
required
to
troop
into
court,
one
after,
and
say
whatever
it
was
they
relied
upon,
and
why
they
made
their
investment
decisions.
that's
a
practical
consideration.
that's
why
presumptions
are
entered
into.
it's
a
rebuttal
presumption
and
i
don't
think
it
does
any
great
violence.
thank
you.
