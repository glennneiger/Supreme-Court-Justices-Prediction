justice
o'connor
doesn't
the
sg
suggest
that
a
simple
no-comment
would
be
all
right,
and
that's
the
way
to
handle
inquiries
of
this
kind?
justice
o'connor
and
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
this
last
statement
at
least
was
false
when
it
was
made.
justice
o'connor
well,
without
getting
into
the
facts,
we
have,
the
district
court
thought
they
were
truthful?
justice
o'connor
and
the
court
of
appeals
thought
the
opposite?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
reads
like
it
said.
justice
o'connor
you
don't
defend
that
as
the
standard?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
about
ordinary
corporate
projections
and
forecasts
in
which
the
corporation
says,
well,
we
think
prospects
look
good
or
bad
or
whatever
they
say?
now,
those
statements
might
be
of
interest
to
investors,
but
courts
have
not
found
that
they
are
statements
on
which
investors
or
people
who
later
sell
or
buy
stock
can
use
as
the
basis
for
a
suit.
isn't
that
right?
they're
deemed
constructively
immaterial?
justice
o'connor
well,
then
they
are
also
i
think
you
will
find
that
they
are
deem
i
constructively
immaterial.
why
should
a
no
corporate
development
statement
such
as
these
be
treated
any
differently
than
forecasts
and
projections?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
some
writers
on
the
subject
think
that
it
has
the
effect
of
chilling
the
prospects
for
mergers
which
in
the
long
run
can
greatly
harm
the
existing
shareholders.
there
certainly
is
some
good
scholarly
writing
to
that
effect.
justice
o'connor
but
in
the
long
ran,
that
kind
of
disclosure
can
end
up
in
effect
causing
a
greater
less
in
shareholder
share
value
than
otherwise.
justice
o'connor
--but
there
was
a
plaintiff
class,
wasn't
there,
here
that
did
not
apparently
have
to
indicate
reliance?
justice
o'connor
well,
i'm
confused.
the
class
that
was
certified
here
did
not
require
reliance,
isn't
that
right.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
gather
from
what
you
say,
though,
you'd
have
no
objection
if
we
thought
reliance
had
to
be
established
or
claimed
for
the
class?
