justice
white
well,
aren't
you...
don't
you
have
some
proceedings
going
on
right
now?
justice
white
well,
you
aren't
taking
them
just
for
exercise,
are
you?
justice
white
so,
what
are
you...
what
proceedings
do
you
have
going
on?
justice
white
what
if
you
win
that?
justice
white
well,
why
did
you
bring
it?
justice
white
trespass
to
try
title.
so,
you're
going
to
lose
that
case,
is
that
it?
justice
white
i
don't
know
how
you
escape
your
concession
that
if
there
were
no
other
way
to
attack
that
this
provision
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
think
you
agree
with
that.
if
there
were
no
other
way
of
attacking
this
void
judgment,
this
meritorious
defense
provision
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
white
i
thought
you
agreed
to
that.
justice
white
that's
not
what
you
say
in
your
brief.
you
say
in
your
brief
after
they
say
there's
no
other
way
to
attack
the
void
judgment,
you
say,
"although
this
may
be
technically
correct,
the
implication
that
appellant
cannot
attack
the
enforcement
of
this
judgment
is
wrong.
"
and
then
in
your
brief,
you
argue
that
his
remedy
was
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
judgment
or
to
have
it
declared
void.
that's
quite
different
from
saying
there's
another
way
to
attack
a
void
judgment
and
have
it
wiped
off
the
books
and
you
do
not
identify
any
rule
or
statute
that
specifies
a
collateral
attack
procedure
which
would
result
in
vacating
the
judgment.
justice
white
but
how
does
anybody
know
it's
void?
justice
white
if
you
look
at
the
face
of
the
judgment.
justice
white
void
on
its
face,
but
you
have
to
accept
the
allegation
that
he
was
never
served.
justice
white
i
know,
but
you
certainly
have
to
go
outside
the
judgment
that's
on
record
to
find
out
whether
there
was...
whether
it's
void
or
not,
whether
there
was
service
or
not.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
was
this
property
sold?
justice
white
was
it
foreclosed
on?
justice
white
and
was--
justice
white
--all
right.
was
it
transferred?
justice
white
what
about
the
lawyer
who
represented
the
buyer?
don't
you
suppose
he
relied
on
that
judgment?
if
you
had
been
a
lawyer
for
the
buyer,
wouldn't
you
have
looked
at
that
judgment
and
wondered
if
it
was
good
and
you
probably
would
have
relied
on
it?
justice
white
i
suppose
he
must
have
charged
the
client
something
for
getting
the
judgment--
justice
white
--whoever
represented...
got
that
judgment
didn't
think
he
was
doing
something
for
nothing
or
that
the
judgment
was
utterly
useless.
justice
white
what
if
there
had
been
notice
in
this
case
and
you
had
come
in
and
said
i
have
absolutely
no
defense
to
this,
i
haven't
paid
and--
justice
white
--will
you
just
wait
a
minute
until
i
ask
my
question?
justice
white
what
would
you
have
done
if
you
were
sued,
as
you
were
in
this
case,
and
you
come
in
and
say
i
have
no
defense,
i
suppose
the
same
judgment
would
have
been
entered,
and
then
what
would
you
have
done?
justice
white
that's
really
what
makes
this
meritorious
defense
business
unconstitutional
in
your
view,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
texas,
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
that
court.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
case.
