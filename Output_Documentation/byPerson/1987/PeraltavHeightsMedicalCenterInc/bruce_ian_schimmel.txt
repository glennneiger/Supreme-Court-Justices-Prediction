mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
texas
rule
of
civil
procedure
number
329(b)(f).
the
question
presented
is
whether
any
state
may
require
a
defendant
to
show
a
meritorious
defense
to
the
underlying
issues
in
order
to
vacate
a
default
judgment
which
has
been
entered
without
personal
jurisdiction
or
is
void
as
a
result
of
procedural
errors
that
have
risen
to
the
level
of
a
denial
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
am
here
today
because
my
client,
mr.
roy
peralta,
has
and
is
continuing
to
be
deprived
as
the
result
of
a
void
judgment
that
was
entered
in
texas
and
filed
with
the
real
property
records
of
harris
county.
this
judgment,
i
cannot
help
him
overturn,
and
he
cannot
be
relieved
of
as
a
result
of
the
catch-22
system
of
procedures
in
the
texas
courts.
mr.
peralta
has
had
$80,000
of
his
real
property
sold
for
$1,720,
an
execution
sale
on
this
void
judgment.
additionally,
he
has
an
award
entered
against
him
for
$5,600
on
a
debt
that
was
previously
unliquidated,
$1,867
for
attorneys
fees
that
are
going
to
be
paid
to
an
attorney
who
violated
his
duty
to
the
court
by
making
a
motion
for
entry
on
a
judgment
where
the
service
showed
on
its
face
that
it
was
void.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
well,
to
begin
with,
they
are
improper
in
their
statement
of
the
law.
believe
me,
i'm
a
board-certified
expert
on
these
matters,
and
if
we
could
have
taken
a
collateral
attack,
i
certainly
would
have
taken
it.
however,
even
if
that
opportunity
were
open
to
us,
that
would
not
make
rule
329(b)(f)
constitutional.
this
court
has
addressed
the
issue
of
post-judgment
remedies
before
in
coe
and
in
the
other
case
that
came
up
from
texas,
manzo
v.
armstrong,
armstrong
v.
manzo,
and
has
said
that
the
only
thing
that
you
can
do
is
to
give
us
a
brand-new
trial
in
this
matter
to
put
us
in
the
exact
same
position.
this
is
what
is
constitutionally
mandated.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
no,
sir.
they
would
try
to
confuse
this
court
on
what
the
status
of
texas
law
is.
this
judgment
recites
in
it
that
it
was
served,
that
it
was
served
regularly,
and
because
that
recitation
is
in
this
void
judgment,
in
texas
courts,
if
we
had
taken
a
collateral
attack,
as
you
will
see
in,
for
instance,...
well,
i'll
cite
the
case
to
you
in
a
moment,
but
as
you
will
see
in
the
texas
courts,
it
clearly
states
because
the
judgment
recites
on
its
face
that
service
was
regularly,
you
cannot
attack
it
collaterally.
so,
they
are
correct,
and
besides,
that's
not
a
matter
of--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--no,
sir,
because--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--to
begin
with,
there's
not
collateral
attack,
and--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--yes,
sir,
i
would,
and
let
me
tell
you
why,
sir.
because
we
would
still
choose
to
directly
attack
it.
if
it's
void,
it's
void
for
all
purposes.
it
should
be
void
in
the
collateral
attack
or
it
should
be
void
in
a
direct
attack,
and
we
would
want
to
take
a
direct
attack
to
clear
the
court
records.
the
collateral
attack
would
not
clear
this
other
record
out
of
the
judgments,
and
as
long
as
it's
in
the
judgments,
under
the
fair
credit
reporting
act,
my
client's
credit
would
be
ruined.
it
will
not
clear...
a
collateral
attack
will
not
clear
the
original
abstracted
judgment.
a
collateral
attack
may
return
us
our
property
that
has
been
taken
as
a
result
of
this,
but
it
will
not
make
the
unsatisfied
portion
of
the
original
judgment,
which
can
be
re-executed
upon,
disappear.
it's
all
still
there.
what
do
we
have
to
do?
wait
until
they
can
again
attach
more
of
our
property
under
the
original
judgment
and
then
go
and
try
and
get
that
back
again?
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
well,
we're
harmed.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
no,
sir,
that
is
not
our
only
immediate
harm.
since
pinnoyer
v.
neff,
it
has
been
this
court's
opinion,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
entry
of
a
judgment
itself
is
a
taking
of
a
liberty
interest
from
us.
we
have
a
right
not
to
be
a
judgment
debtor.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
no,
ma'am.
i
believe
that
paul
v.
davis
is
really
not
applicable
for
several
reasons.
i
think
that
that
case
turned
on
whether
or
not
the
tort
that
occurred
was,
in
fact,
a
change
in
status,
unlike
wisconsin
v.
constantineau,
where
we
actually
had
a
law
that
allowed
a
change
of
status
where
a
person
was
not
able
to
buy
liquor
once
an
official
officially
made
him
a
"drunkard".
in
paul
v.
davis,
there
was
no
statute
that
said
a
person
could
not
get
a
job
or
could
not
shop
once
the
chief
of
police
has
determined
that
he
is
a
v.
davis
is
distinguishable
from
the
situation
here.
here,
when
the
court
says
it
is--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--no,
ma'am,
and
the
reason
is
quite
clear.
anything
other
than
a
bill
of
review
is
an
indirect
attack
and
because
the
judgment
itself
cites
on
it
that
service
was
regular,
even
though
constitutionally
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
it's
void,
even
the
recitation
of
regular
service
should
also
not
stand
up,
that's
not
the
law
in
texas.
crawford
v.
mcdonald
and
the
other
cases
say
that
if
it
says
on
its
face
that
the
judgment
is
void,
that
will
be
preclusive.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
even
this
preclusive
effect
is
unconstitutional,
but
that's
not
really
the
issue
in
front
of
us.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
in
actuality,
it
would
not,
and
the
reason
would
be
because
although
we
would
be
able
to
get
a
temporary
injunction
during
the
pendency
of
the
collateral
attack,
because
the
collateral
attack
would
have
to
fail
as
a
result
of
the
recitation
of
the
judgment,
at
the
end
of
that
pendency,
the
injunction
would
be
vacated,
and
then
they
would
be
open
to
taking
our
property
again
and
doing
all
these
other
things
to
us.
so,
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be
no,
ma'am.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
yes,
sir.
the
proceedings
that
we
have--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--no,
sir,
we
are
not,
and
i
think
that
it
needs
to
be
made
clear
to
the
court
why
we
are
taking
these
other
proceedings.
during
the
discovery
on
this
case,
we
have
found
that,
in
fact,
the
purchasers
who
purchased
at
this
execution
sale
have
also
gone
back
and
gone
to
the
lender
that
mr.
peralta
was
making
his
payments
to,
unknown
to
him,
and
gotten
a
second
deed
for
a...
we
feel
it's
a
fraudulent
deed
for
closure
of
the
lender's
lien
against
my
client.
my
client
didn't
find
out
about
this
until
not
only
after
he
had
paid
off
the
loan
entirely--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--well,
that
is
what
we
call
trespass
to
try
title
in
order
to
get--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--if
we
win
that,
that
will
not...
well,
first
of
all,
we
can't
win
that
with
this
judgment.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
because
we
want
to
toll
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
second
deed,
not
the
one
that
issued
out
of
the
constable
on
this
execution
sale.
the
one
that
issued
that
out
of
the
lender
on
the
foreclosure
of
the--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--if
we
do
not
win
here,
we
automatically
lose
that
case
because
in
trespass
to
try
title,
you
must
prove...
you
have
a
burden
placed
upon
you
to
prove
your
ownership
good
as
against
the
entitled
world.
you
cannot
rely
on
the
infirmity
of
the
defendant's
ownership.
you
must
prove
it
good
as
against
the
entitled
world
and
as
a
result
of
that,
this
judgment
execution,
even
if
it
hadn't
been
to
the
chinns,
i
might
add,
who
were
the
purchasers
at
the
foreclosure
sale
on
the
trustee's
fees,
even
if
it
hadn't
been
to
them,
would
make
the
chinns
victorious
in
their
suit
in
the
second
case.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
mr.
justice,
when
i
sat
down
with
this
case
the
first
time
and
researched
the
law
on
it,
the
courts
of
the
state
of
texas
told
me
it
was
mandated
for
me
to
bring
a
bill
of
review
proceeding.
i
followed
the
law
of
the
courts
of
the
state
of
texas
and
brought
the
bill
of
review
proceeding
as
a
result
of
that.
if
i
do
not
prevail
on
this,
it
will
be
used
as
res
judicata
in
the
collateral
attack
under
theories
that
this
court
addressed
in
joiner
v.
vasquez
from
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
it's
my
understanding
that
if
the
theories
in
pinnoyer
v.
neff
and
coe
v.
armstrong
are
still
good
law
today,
that
we
should
be
able
to
directly
attack
this.
if
it's
void,
it's
void
on
direct
attack.
if
it's
void,
it's
void
on
collateral
attack.
why
should
we
be
precluded
from
a
default
judgment
which
was
entered
without
jurisdiction?
why
should
that
make
me
choose
a
way
to
attack
something
for
my
client?
isn't
that
a
preclusive
effect
from
the
default...
from
the
void
judgment?
isn't
that
a
shifting
of
burden
that
was
addressed
in
armstrong
v.
manzo
where
it
says
that
to
shift
these
burdens
is
unconstitutional?
that
is
the
way
we
feel
about
it.
we
should
be
at
liberty
to
bring
either
one
of
those
attacks.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
sir.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
well,
the
law
of
the
state
of
texas
says
that
force
and
effect
can
be
given
where
personal
jurisdiction
has
not
been
had
over
us.
pinnoyer
v.
neff
says
you
must
have
personal
jurisdiction,
otherwise
it's
void.
this
case
is
very
similar.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
yes,
sir,
it
was
raised.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
yes,
sir,
it
was
raised
here.
it
was
raised--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--sir?
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
case
law
is
part
of
the
rule.
it
has
been
ruled
on
many
times
that
the
determination--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--the
rule
and
the
cases
that
go
with
it
has
been
objected
to.
it
is
the
case
law
that
says
you
must
have
meritorious
defense
under
this
rule,
and
that
has
become
part
and
parcel
of
the
rule
itself
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
well,
not
only
that,--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--i
hope
you
agree
with
me,
sir.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
sir,
there
is
a
federal
question
whenever
eighty
acres
is
taken
away
on
a
void
default
judgment
without
personal
service
of
process
over
the
defendant.
this
court
has
ruled
that
over
and
over
again.
there
is
a
federal
question
when
a
person
is
impinged
in
his
liberty
to
mortgage
the
property
he
already
owns
because
there
is
a
judgment
on
the
records,
the
real
property
records
of
harris
county,
texas.
mr.
peralta
cannot
go
out
and
even
mortgage
the
land
he
already
owns
because
no
title
insurance
company
will
allow
him
to
do
that.
there
is
a
deprivation
of
property
that
has
already
occurred.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
which
other
one,
sir?
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
this
case,
if
we
do
not
win
this
case,
will
automatically
decide
the
other
one
against
us.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
oh,
i
certainly
agree
that
you
cannot
decide
that
case
now.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
sir?
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
i'm
sorry,
sir.
it
was
brought
up
by
the
court,
not
by
me.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
oh,
no,
sir,
i
do
not
need
to
win
in
that
case
in
order
to
win
this
case,
sir.
but
i
certainly
need
to
win
this
case
in
order
to
win
that
one.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
the
rule
requires
us
to
show
meritorious
defense
to
overturn
a
judgment
which
was
entered
without
due
process
of
law.
that
is
the
exact
same
situation
that
this
court
had
before
it
in
armstrong
v.
manzo
where
the
state
of
texas
required
a
father
to
go
in
after
judgment,
although
service
of
process
had
not
been
made
upon
him,
and
shifted
the
burden
of
proof
upon
him
to
prove
that,
in
fact,
he--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--sir?
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
no,
sir,
i
was
not.
i
don't
believe
that
i
was
out
of
elementary
school
at
the
time,
sir.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
oh.
no,
sir.
the
case
was
decided
in
the
early
sixties,
sir.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
the
federal
question
is
may
any
court
put
a
procedural
burden
of
proving
meritorious
defense
in
order
to
overturn
a
void
judgment
on
a
direct
attack.
that,
i
would
think,
is
a
very
clear
federal
question.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
yes,
we
did
try
it,
sir.
that
was--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--sir,
we
cannot
try
it
in
the
state
of
texas
the
other
way.
the
cases
in
the
state
of
texas
say
that
if
we
go
in
on
that
collateral
attack
and
say
that
this
judgment
that
is
before
you
all
today
is
void,
they
will
say
this
is
a
collateral
attack
like
they
did
in
the
austin
school
district
case.
this
is
a
collateral
attack.
the
case
recites
on
its
face
the
service
of
process.
therefore,
you
cannot
collateral
it
and
you
must
bring
a
bill
of
review
proceeding.
so,
we
have
done
that.
that
is
the
law
in
the
state
of
texas
at
this
point.
so,
we
have
followed
the
law
and
because
we
have
been
forced
into
this,...
you
see,
it's
a
catch-22.
are
we
not
to
be
able
to
object
on
this
end
of
the
catch-22
and
may
we
only
object
on
that
end
of
the
catch-22?
if
we're
caught
in
what
the
computer
people
call
a
"du
loop",
i
think
we
should
be
able
to
cut
it
off
at
either
end.
if
the
procedure
in
bill
of
review
says
unless
you
show
a
meritorious
defense,
and
this
court
has
ruled
on
several
occasions,
in
coe
v.
armour
fertilizer
works
as
well
as
armstrong
v.
manzo,
that
we
do
not
have
to
show
a
meritorious
defense,
then
this
procedure
is
defective
and
must
be
ruled
unconstitutional
by
the
court.
if
the
court
then...
since
it
is
to
the
other
area,
if
the
court...
if
we
then
go
not
on
collateral
attack
but
in
just
our
other
issues,
we
don't
have
to
bring
collateral
attack.
see,
if
we
win
here,
there
is
no
necessity
to
bring
a
collateral
attack.
my
other
case
is
not
a
collateral
attack
on
this
issue.
this
other
case
has
to
deal
with
a
second
deed
from
the
same
person,
from
the
lender
to
the
same
person,
and
this
court
should
distinguish
those
two
cases.
it
just
so
happens
to
be
that
because
of
the
status
of
the
law
in
trespass
to
try
title,
that
i
will
automatically
be
defeated
on
that
because
i
will
have
to
prove
on
behalf
of
my
client
that
not
only
was
the
deed
from
the
trustee
to...
from
the
trustee
in
the
lender's
situation
to
the
chinns,
not
only
was
that
void,
but
also
every
other
impediment
on
our
title,
whether
it's
this
or
any
other
judgment
that
an
execution
is
issued
on,
is
also
against
us.
we
must
remove
that
from
the
record
in
order
for
us
to
succeed
on
this
other
case,
and
that's
why
the
other
case
was
brought.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
it
does
not
involve
a
collateral
attack.
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
to
you
in
our
brief,
if
you'll
look
at
them,
sir,
are
almost
every
one
of
them
trespass
to
try
title
cases,
where
the
courts
in
the
state
of
texas
have
said
you
have
another
judgment,
you
cannot
collaterally
attack
that
on
this
trespass
to
try
title.
crawford
v.
mcdonald
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
texas.
you
cannot--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--we
have
two
mars
on
our
title,
sir.
we
have
not
only
this
execution
sale,
which
we
are
attacking
directly,
but
we
have
a
trustee's
deed
which
we
also
had
to
attack
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
heights
medical
center,
and
that
is
what
the
second
case
is
about.
removing
that.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
no,
sir.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
we
also,
in
that
suit,
would
not
be
able
to
prove
that
this
execution
sale
was
invalid
because
the
court
in
texas
will
look
at
it
and
say
there
is
a
recitation
on
the
face
of
the
judgment
that
service
was
regular.
you
must
directly
attack
it.
that
is
the
position
that
we're
in.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
no,
sir,
we
cannot
win
that
suit
without
demonstrating
that.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
well,
if
we
were
allowed
to
question
that,
then
it
would
be
a
collateral
attack.
we
are
not
going
to
be
allowed
in
the
state
of
texas
to
question
that.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
no,
sir.
that
means
that
there
is
an
unconstitutional
preclusive
effect
of
a
void
default
judgment.
it
means
that
the
default
judgment
entered
in
this
case
will
be
given
light
and
imbued
with
some
power,
although
we
didn't
service,
we
didn't
appear,
and
we
didn't
find
out
about
it
until
years
later.
that
is
fundamentally
repugnant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
how
can
it
have
any
life
in
a
collateral
or
direct
attack?
we
can
remove...
if
we
remove
this
other
deed,
then
here
we
are
again,
yet
we
will
not
be
able
to
remove
this
deed
in
that
other
proceeding.
it
will
not
be
allowed
in
the
state
of
texas
because,
among
other
things,
we
have
chosen
to
directly
attack
it.
you
know,
one
of
the
pleadings,
it
was
the
attorney
for
the
respondents
in
the
cause
of
action
who
put
the
pleadings
in
this
other
case
into
evidence
here,
if
you
will
read
their
answer,
their
answer
to
the
pleadings
that
we
filed
in
this
other
case,
they
claim
res
judicata,
and
i
would
fear
that
under
joiner
v.
vasquez,
where
it
says
if
you
don't
appeal
from
a
denial
of
the
bill
of
review,
that
it
is
res
judicata,
that
they
will
prevail
on
that
because
that
is
why
we
have
appealed
this
all
the
way
up.
we're
not
free
to
collaterally
attack
it,
if
we
have
taken
the
bill
of
review
proceeding.
once
the
die
is
cast,
we
have
to
go
all
the
way
through
with
it.
how
can
a
void
judgment
be
given
res
judicata
effect?
how
can
a
recitation
in
a
void
judgment
be
given
any
life?
the
courts
of
texas
say
we
have
to
directly
attack
it.
that
is
what
we
have
done
here.
as
i
believe
it
was
cited
in
one
of
the
cases
that
we
cited
to
you,
i
know
of
no
case
that
you
can
collaterally
attack
that
you
cannot
directly
attack.
why
are
we
precluded
from
bringing
a
direct
attack?
if
it's
void,
it
should
be
void
for
all
purposes.
on
direct
attack
and
collateral.
we
will
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
for
rebuttal,
sir.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
thank
you,
sir.
this
court
looked
at
an
extremely
similar
procedure
in
armstrong
v.
manzo.
at
that
time,
this
court
did
not
say,
well,
why
didn't
mr.
armstrong
go
in
and
collaterally
attack
this
judgment
denying
his
children's
rights.
because
we
should
be
able
to
bring
the
direct
attack.
the
counsel
for
the
people
over
at
heights
medical
center
waited
until
after
all
time
limits
had
ran
before
we
could
take
an
appeal,
before
any
action
was
taken
on
this.
it
needs
to
be
emphasized
to
this
court
that
even
after
the
supposed
execution
sale
and
the
supposed
trustee's
deed,
the
people
who
bought
this
property
waited
for
months
and
even
years
before
even
attempting
to
contact
my
client
to
say
that
they
owned
the
property...
that
they
no
longer
owned
the
property
and
waited
until
after
we
had
paid
off
the
first
mortgage
before
making
any
attempts
to
do
that.
if
this
court
upholds
this
rule
of
civil
procedure,
what
this
court
is
saying
is
that
in
the
state
of
texas,
after
six
months
on
the
entry
of
a
judgment,
you
have
absolutely
no
right
to
a
direct
appeal
or
direct
attack
on
the
judgment.
that
is
what
this
court
will
be
saying
because
you
can
only
use
bill
of
review
if
six
months
has
gone
by
after
the
entry
of
the
judgment.
every
method
that
was
cited
by
the
attorney
general
in
their
brief,
on
their
long
expounding
on
the
different
ways
that
you
can
attack,
are
all
six
months
and
a
day
short
of
what
our
situation
is
here,
and
even
this
remedy
in
texas
cannot
be
brought
after
four
years.
so,
they've
now
placed
a
four-year
statute
of
limitations
on
attacking
default
judgments
in
the
state
of
texas,
even
if
they're
totally
void.
you
cannot
directly
attack
even
by
bill
of
review.
this
is
a
void
act.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
yes,
sir,
i
do.
i
believe
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
mandates
that
if
the
issue
is
one
of
lack
of
jurisdiction,
that
lack
of
jurisdiction
is
void
forever
and
always
under
all
circumstances.
that's
pinnoyer
v.
neff.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
well,
fortunately,
we
didn't
wait
four
years.
had
we
waited
four
years,
then
we
would
have
had
an
additional
burden
placed
in
front
of
us,
and
all
of
the
injunctive
relief
which
the
courts
supposedly
say
that
we
can
have
without
citing
one
case,
all
that
injunctive
relief...
in
an
injunctive
proceeding,
the
burden
is
on
us
to
go
in
and
prove
that
we
have
a
right,
that
we
will
ultimately
win.
this
is
exactly
the
opposite
statement
that
was
made
by
this
court
in
armstrong
v.
manzo.
it
even
says,
"the
shifting
of
this
burden
therein
often
lies
who
will
win
and
who
will
lose.
"
that's
what
this
court
said.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
that's
due
process
of
law,
sir.
we
have
an
opportunity--
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
--sorry.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
we
would
have
paid
the
judgment
and
not
lost
our
property.
we
would
have
paid
the
judgment
and
satisfied
it
and
not
lost
our
good
name.
that
was
deprived
us.
we
did
not
have
that
opportunity.
no
demand
was
ever
made
on
us
to
pay
the
unpaid
amount
or
to
enter
into
the
court.
we
could
have
saved
our
good
name.
we
could
have
saved
our
property.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
ian
schimmel
i
am
not
familiar
with
that,
sir.
i
do
not
know
whether
or
not
they
do
or
do
not
have
that
procedure.
no
one
has
asked
me
to
brief
it,
sir.
i
would
also
like
to
close
by
stating
texas
gives
great
lip
service
in
its
cases
to
say
that,
in
fact,
you
can
bring
collateral
attacks,
yet
not
one
of
the
collateral
attacks
that
has
ever
been
brought
and
cited
to
you
in
these
cases
has
ever
succeeded,
except
this
one
case
that
was
improperly
decided,
commander
v.
bryan,
and
even
that
case
was
not
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
texas,
so
it's
not
stare
decisis.
it
was
relied
on
by
the
dissent
in
the
case
that
did
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
texas,
mcewen
v.
harrison,
where
they
said
the
exact
opposite,
and
ultimately
its
ultimate
judgment
shows
the
poverty
of
legal
thinking
in
that
case
because
it
says
that
you
can
attack
a
case
over
and
over
and
over
again
that's
void
on
its
face
and
have
no
res
judicata
effect,
which
is
entirely
in
opposite
with
joiner
v.
vasquez,
which
was
cert.
denied
by
this
court
and
which
the
supreme
court
of
texas
said
the
exact
opposite.
once
you
do
submit
to
the
procedure,
you're
bound
by
it,
even
if
they
didn't
have
jurisdiction
over
you
before.
if
you
make
a
bill
of
review
and
you
lose
that
bill
of
review,
you
must
appeal
it
all
the
way.
you
cannot
bring
a
separate
bill
of
review
proceeding
or
separate
collateral
attack.
it's
res
judicata.
so,
that
case
is
simply
not
right.
also,
it
is
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
case
and
not
a
personal
jurisdiction
case,
and
the
judgment
in
that
case
shows
on
its
face
that
the
court
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction...
it
did
not
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
texas
starts
his
brief
from
a
wrong
point.
he
states
that
the
face
of
this
judgment
is
void
when,
in
fact,
the
face
of
the
judgment
is
not
void.
the
face
of
this
judgment
shows
the
exact
opposite
and
recites
that
service
was
properly
made.
so,
anything
that
is
stated
by
the
state
of
texas
beyond
that
point,
based
upon
that
premise,
cannot
be
correct,
and
the
cases
that
they
cite
to
you,
i
would
hold,
simply
are
not
the
law
in
the
state
of
texas,
and
the
portion
of
their
case
where
they
say
you
can
bring
a
collateral
attack
has
not
one
case
cited,
has
not
one
case
cited,
and
this
whole
procedure
that
we've
gone
through
here,
nobody
on
the
opposition
or
amicus
has
cited
to
this
case
where
there
has
been
a
collateral
attack
where
the
judgment
comes
from
inside
the
state
of
texas,
not
from
outside
the
state
of
texas,
where
the
issue
was
did
you
serve
the
defendant
and
the
answer
was
no,
and
they
said
you
can
collaterally
attack
this,
not
where
there
is
a
recitation.
they
cannot
do
it.
it
does
not
exist.
this
is
our
only
method
of
attack
and
for
that
reason,
we
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
rule
in
our
favor.
