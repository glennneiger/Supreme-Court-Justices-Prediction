justice
scalia
to
solve
that,
we
don't
have
to
strike
down
the
whole
rule.
we
can
just
say
the
rule
is
no
good
if
you
do
not
allow
collateral
attack.
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
scalia
because
if
there
is
collateral
attack,
the
rule
makes
a
lot
of
sense
to
me.
why
was
the
court's
time?
justice
scalia
i
understand,
but
if
there
were,
would
you
still
say
the
rule
was
no
good?
justice
scalia
wait
until
you're
harmed,
like
everybody
else.
justice
scalia
your
only
immediate
harm,
as
i
understand
it,
is
going
to
be
your
credit
rating.
that
is--
justice
scalia
but,
mr.
schimmel,
if
your
real
problem,
if
your
real
complaint
is
the
inability
to
make
a
collateral
attack,
which
is
what
you're
now
discussing,
surely
the
way
to
remedy
that
is
to
appeal
from
the
decision
that
does
not
allow
you
to
make
a
collateral
attack,
rather
than
to
say
that
this
rule,
rule
19,
is
bad.
rule
19
may
be
perfectly...
assuming
rule
19
is
okay,
if
collateral
attack
is
allowed,
it
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
way
to
complain
about
the
inability
to
make
collateral
attack
to
come
in
saying
rule
19
is
no
good.
justice
scalia
if
that
happens,
come
and
appeal
the
collateral
attack.
i
think
you
would
well
have
a
good
case
there.
justice
scalia
so,
the
other
case
does
then,
if
you
say
that's
an
essential
part
of
it,
it
does
involve
a
collateral
attack
upon
this
case.
justice
scalia
it's
a
collateral
attack
case
if
it
has
any
chance
of
succeeding.
let
me
rephrase
it.
it's
either
a
collateral
attack
case
or
you're
a
fool
to
bring
it.
is
that
what
you're
telling
us.
justice
scalia
can
you
win--
justice
scalia
--can
you
win
by...
in
attacking
the
trustee's
deed
without
demonstrating
that
this
judgment
was
invalid?
justice
scalia
then,
the
suit
represents
a
collateral
attack.
justice
scalia
can
you
win
that
suit
without
demonstrating
the
invalidity
of
this
judgment?
justice
scalia
that,
to
me,
means
that
that
suit
is
a
collateral
attack.
i
don't
know
any
other
definition
of
a
collateral
attack.
justice
scalia
that
just
means
that
you're
going
to
lose.
justice
scalia
mr.
urquhart,
as
i
understand
your
theory,
it's
that
there's
no
deprivation
of
property
by
the
mere
existence
on
the
books
of
this
judgment
which
is
void,
right?
justice
scalia
if
that
is
so,
how
is
it
that
we
will
entertain
an
appeal
to
this
court
on
the
basis
of
the
due
process
clause
from
the
entry
by
a
state
supreme
court
of
a
judgment
in
a
matter
in
which
it
has
no
jurisdiction?
i
mean,
it
happens
all
the
time.
a
person
comes
here
and
says
we've
been
deprived
of
property
without
due
process
of
law,
not
because
this
judgment
has
been
executed
upon
yet,
but
merely
because
this
court
is
about
to
enter
this
judgment
or
has
entered
this
judgment.
we
entertain
those
suits.
that
must
mean
that
the
mere
existence
of
the
judgment
is
a
deprivation
of
property,
musn't
it?
justice
scalia
you
may
be
right.
it
may
well
be
a
void
judgment
because,
if
executed
upon,
it
would
deprive
you
of
property
without
due
process,
but
until
it's
executed
upon,
there's
no
harm
done.
it
is,
after
all,
a
void
judgment.
so,
there's
no
federal
violation.
why
wouldn't
we
have
said
that
in
all
those
cases?
the
fact
is
we
do
entertain
attacks
on
the
basis
that
the
state
had
no
jurisdiction
on
this
matter.
we
entertain
those
attacks
in
the
original
suit.
we
don't
wait
until
the
suit
is
executed
upon,
and
i
don't
know
why
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
petitioner
here
has
a
right
to
have
some
method
of
eliminating
the
mere
existence
of
that
judgment.
justice
scalia
although
it's
appealable
here
on
the
basis
that
there
has
been
a
deprivation
of
property?
justice
scalia
i
started
off
agreeing
with
you
on
that,
but
i
just
can't
explain
why
we
entertain
these
suits
then,
unless
we
are
of
the
view
that
the
mere
entry
of
a
void
judgment
is
a
deprivation
of
property.
mr.
urquhart,
just
so
i
can
be
sure
i
understand
what
you're
saying
in
response
to
all
these
questions,
if
we
assume
that
there
is
no
other
procedure
at
all
in
texas,
other
than
the
bill
of
review
procedure,
whereby
the
judgment
itself
could
be
stricken
as
opposed
to
simply
preventing
its
enforcement,
do
you
think
there
is
a
due
process
violation
or
would
be?
