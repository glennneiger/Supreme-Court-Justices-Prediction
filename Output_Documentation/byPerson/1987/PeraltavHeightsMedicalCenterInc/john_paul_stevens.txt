justice
stevens
mr.
urquhart,
could
i
interrupt
you?
justice
stevens
the
state
of
texas
has
filed
an
amicus
curiae
brief.
justice
stevens
in
which
they
say
that
once
the
time
for
all
of
the
prior
proceedings,
which
they
describe,
have
elapsed,
the
only
remaining
way
to
directly
attack
the
voidable
default
judgment
is
through
a
bill
of
review.
do
you
disagree
with
that
statement?
justice
stevens
but,
then,
they
go
on
and
describe
injunctive
relief,
but
they
say
that
in
the
other
reliefs,
you
also
must
plead
a
meritorious
defense.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
consequence
of
bringing
it
is
that
if
you
make
such
an
allegation
and
have
an
arguable
defense,
they
set
aside
the
judgment,
don't
they?
justice
stevens
only
to
immediately
reinstate
it?
justice
stevens
why
is
it
a
waste
of
time?
it
would
have
made
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
this
case
if
they
had
granted
relief
by
way
of
the
bill
of
review
because
then
you
couldn't
have
executed
the...
the
execution
would
then
fall
right
away.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
but
if
you
did
have
a
good...
say
you
set
aside
the
judgment,
said
okay
we'll
now
try
the
case,
you
try
the
case,
you
enter
a
new
judgment,
that
would
mean
that
the
earlier
execution
on
the
void
judgment
would
no
longer
stand.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
you
have
to
enter
a
new
judgment,
wouldn't
you?
if
you
granted
relief
and
then
found
that
there
was
no
merit
to
the
pleaded
defense,
you'd
have
to
enter
a
new
judgment,
wouldn't
you?
justice
stevens
and,
therefore,
would
that
not
vacate
the
prior
proceedings
taken
in
execution
of
the
original
judgment?
justice
stevens
and
would
you...
do
you
concede
that
if
his
allegations
are
true,
that
this
is
a
void
judgment?
justice
stevens
well,
then,
what's
your
objection
to
opening
the
judgment?
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
urquhart,
the
texas
court
in
its
opinion
didn't
make
reference
to
any
other
remedy.
its
answer
to
the
due
process
challenge
was
that
as
long
as
you
have
the
right
to
assert
a
meritorious
defense,
that's
all
you
have
to
do,
but
if
you
can't
do
that,
you
get
no
relief.
that's
basically
what
that
opinion
says.
would
you
defend
that
theory?
justice
stevens
you
do
defend
the
opinion?
justice
stevens
supposing
it
also
said
there
is
no
other
relief
except
the
bill
of
review
and
you
may
not
have
any
relief
unless
you
can
assert
a
meritorious
defense,
would
you
say
that
would
be
constitutional?
justice
stevens
but
if
he's
really
saying
your...
the
response
to
the
constitutional
argument
is
you
pursued
the
wrong
remedy,
he
didn't
say
that.
justice
stevens
neither
does
the
texas
attorney
general
identify
any
other
remedy
in
which
you
do
not
have
to
prove
a
meritorious
defense.
am
i
right
on
that?
justice
stevens
where
does
the
texas
attorney
general
call
our
attention
to
the
remedy
you
described?
justice
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
while
the
collateral
attack
is
pending,
it
takes
time,
i
take
it,
to
litigate
the
collateral
attack,
the
judgment
remains
on
the
books
and
remains
an
impediment
and
a
cloud
on
the
title
to
the
assets
of
this
litigant?
justice
stevens
and
what
is
the
justification
for
that
burden?
justice
stevens
but
if
it's
nothing,
it
was
the
foundation
for
your
execution
and
apparently
a
sheriff's
sale
and
a
lot
of
other
things
that
happened
that
caused
the
transfer
of
ownership
interest
in
property,
all
based
on
this
judgment,
if
we
take
the
facts
as
pleaded.
justice
stevens
but
can
not
we
presume
that
if
there's
a
judgment
on
the
books,
that
they
would
go
ahead
and
execute
it?
they
could
have
done
so
consistently
with
your
theory.
whether
they
really
did
or
not,
it
was
subject
to
being
executed.
the
property
could
have
been
sold.
justice
stevens
and
if
they
didn't
know
about
it,
so
they
couldn't
bring
a
collateral
attack
until
after
the
sale
took
place,
how
could
they
protect
themselves?
justice
stevens
well,
that
may
be.
i
can't
get
into
the
facts.
hypothetically,
at
least,
this
procedure
would
permit
this
kind
of
transaction
to
take
place.
the
judgment
gets
on
the
books
that
the
defendant
knows
nothing
about
and
a
sale
of
property
could
take
place
without
his
knowing
about
it.
justice
stevens
and
i
don't
understand
the
state's
interest
in
having
that
scenario
be
a
possible
way
to
dispose
of
this
kind
of
litigation.
justice
stevens
you
didn't
say
that
in
your
brief.
justice
stevens
the
texas
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
that
either.
justice
stevens
well,
would
you
say
that
supposing
the
judgment
was
entered,
the
defendant
didn't
even
know
about
it,
and
the
plaintiff
just
let
it
sit
there
for,
say,
three
years,
they
just...
and
then
three
years
later
they
found
out
about
it
and
brought
a
proceeding
to
set
it
aside,
would
you
say
there
had
been
no
impact
on...
no
deprivation
of
property
during
that
three
year
period?
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
not
saying
whether
it's
without
due
process.
the
question
is
would
there
be
a
deprivation
of
property
merely
by
virtue
of
the
entry
of
a
judgment
which
remains
on
the
official
records
of
the
county
for
three
years?
does
that
deprive
anybody
of
property?
justice
stevens
mr.
schimmel,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
of
texas
procedure?
justice
stevens
does
texas
have
a
certification
procedure
whereby
if
we
were
concerned
about
the
question
of
state
law,
we
could
certify
the
question
to
the
texas
court?
do
you
know?
