justice
o'connor
--mr.
schimmel,
doesn't
paul
v.
davis
suggest
there's
no
liberty
interest
in
reputation
alone?
justice
o'connor
mr.
schimmel,
let
me
ask
you
something
else.
could
you
bring
in
texas
a
declaratory
judgment
to
establish
whether
or
not
the
judgment
against
your
client
was
void?
justice
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
does
texas
law
allow
you
to
prevent
all
efforts
to
enforce
the
judgment
in
this
case
by
collateral
means?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
urquhart,
your
opposing
counsel
vehemently
disputes
that
there
is
any
other
procedure
which
would
give
him
relief.
now,
how
are
we
to
evaluate
that?
we're
not
in
a
very
good
position
here
to
know
that.
justice
o'connor
such
as
what?
justice
o'connor
he
said
that's
absolutely
unavailable
where
the
judgment
on
its
face
recites
service
was
proper.
justice
o'connor
so,
in
other
words,
it's
an
open
question
whether
if
this
petitioner
follows
some
other
procedure
in
texas,
whether
relief
can
be
obtained?
justice
o'connor
forget
this
case.
if
there
is
no
other
procedure
under
texas
law
except
the
bill
of
review,
for
setting
aside
a
void
judgment,
without
establishing
a
meritorious
defense,
is
there
a
due
process
problem
violation?
