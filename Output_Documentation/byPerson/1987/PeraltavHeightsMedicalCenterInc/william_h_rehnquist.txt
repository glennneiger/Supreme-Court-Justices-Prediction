chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schimmel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
schimmel,--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--i
understand
your
opponents
in
this
case
to
contend
that
texas
does
provide
relief
from
this
sort
of
judgment
and
certainly
from
execution
on
it,
but
that
you
simply
have
taken
the
wrong
procedural
tact.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
again,
i
had
thought
that,
at
least
one
of
your
opponents
contended,
that
had
you
followed
the
proper
texas
procedure,
you
could
have
ended
up
with
a
new
trial
rather
than
just
having
to
produce
a
meritorious
defense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schimmel.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
urquhart.
chief
justice
rehnquist
then,
mr.
urquhart,
certainly,
it
seems,
i
guess,
apparent
to
some
my
colleagues
and
perhaps
to
the
counsel
that
if
this
were
the
only
provision
of
texas
law
under
which
one
could
attack
a
default
judgment
entered
against
him,
it
might
well
lack
something
in
the
way
of
procedural
due
process.
you
say
it's
not
the
only
process,
that
mr.
peralta,
as
he
is
situated,
could
have
brought
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
where,
in
the
state
trial
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
it's
briefed
in
a
sense
that
peralta's
contention
is
that
i
brought
a
bill
of
review
because
i
claimed
the
judgment
was
improperly
served
on
my
client...
on
me.
i
was
told
by
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
that
you
have
to
have
a
meritorious
defense
in
order
to
set
aside
a
judgment
under
a
bill
of
review.
that
is
not
constitutional,
peralta
says,
because
i
shouldn't
have
to
prove
a
meritorious
defense
before
i
can
set
aside
a
void
judgment
that
was
never
properly
served.
so,
i
think
that
is
before
us.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
then,
you're
saying,
in
effect,
that
this
judgment,
which
recites
on
its
face
that
it
was
properly
served
and
is
presumably
on
file
and,
you
know,
a
title
company
looking
at
that
judgment
isn't
going
to
go
back
and
interview
the
people
about
whether
the
facts
conform
to
what
the
record
shows,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
really
be
a
cloud
on
the
title.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you
believe
shakespeare
that
he
who
steals
my
purse
steals
trash,
perhaps
reputation
is
more
important
than
money,
but
i
should
think
this
would
be
a
real
impairment
of
one's
property
right.
i
don't
know
what
the
texas
law
is,
but
in
arizona,
a
recorded
judgment
was
a
lien
upon
all
of
your
real
property.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
may
be
right,
but
how
about
the
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
urquhart.
mr.
schimmel,
you
have
nine
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
it's
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
say
that
a
paper
claim
duly
recorded
after
a
period
of
time
is
taken
at
its
face
value?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
maybe
you
don't
have
to
make
quite
that
sweeping
a
claim
to
win
this
case
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schimmel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-1430,
peralta
versus
heights
medical
center
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
