mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
default
judgment
that
is
entered
by
a
court
that
does
not
have
personal
jurisdiction
is
void
under
texas
law.
it
is
a
nullity.
it
has
absolutely
no
legal
effect.
it
can
be
collaterally
attacked
at
any
time
by
anyone.
an
attempt
to
execute--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--yes.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
i
agree
with
the
statement,
underlining
that
the
only
way
to
directly
attack
a
void
judgment
is
through
the
bill
of
review
mechanism.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
your
honor,
what
the
attorney
general's
brief
was
doing
was
reciting
methods
of
direct
attack.
they
were
not
raising
the
issue
of
collateral
attack
under
texas
law.
the
distinction
between
a
direct
attack
and
a
collateral
attack
is
that
the
relief
granted
by
direct
attack
is
a
change
in
the
attack
judgment.
in
other
words,
you
only
bring
a
direct
attack
if
you
have
at
least
an
arguable
defense.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
only
to
immediately
reinstate
it,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
right.
you
see,
a
direct
attack
like
the
bill
of
review
procedure
that
is
here,
the
direct
appeal,
the
writ
of
error,
all
of
which
are
mentioned
in
the
attorney
general's
brief,
the
result
of
those
procedures
is
the
granting
of
a
new
trial.
that's
the
reason
that
you
seek
those
procedures,
and
if
you
have
no
meritorious
defense,
then
you're
wrong
ever
to
pursue
a
direct
attack
under
texas
law
because
you're
engaging
in
a
waste
of
time.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
no.
your
honor,
if
i
can
try
to
directly
respond
to
your
question
by
explaining
the
bill
of
review
procedure.
i'm
not
trying
to
evade
the
question
at
all.
the
bill
of
review
procedure,
understand,
is
an
equitable
procedure
that
is
available
to
people
after
everything
else
has
run
out
in
terms
of
direct
attack.
it's
really
designed
not
where
there
is
a
jurisdictional
question
involved
but
where
somebody
has
a
good
defense.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
and
a
court
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
but
the
bill
of
review
procedure,
your
honor,
works
like
this.
it's
a
bang-bang
procedure.
you...
the
bill
of
review--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--right,
and
this--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--it
would,
in
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
i
think
i'd
go
further
than
that,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
we
have
to,
i
think,
all
of
us,
accept
that
his
allegations
are
correct
and
that
it
is,
therefore,
a
void
judgment
because
of
the
posture
that
this
case
is
in.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
your
honor,
my
objection
is
simply
this,
that
what
is
being
attacked
in
this
case
is
a
specific
procedure,
and
the
specific
procedure
is
a
salutary
procedure.
it
enables
people
to
recover
who
otherwise
would
not
recover
and
it
is
designed
specifically
for
people
who
have
defenses.
my
objection
is...
my
opposition
has
a
whole
panoply
of
remedies
that
they
could
pursue
that
would
enable
them
to
achieve
exactly
the
purpose
that
they
want
to
achieve.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
is
accurate.
if
i
can
explain
my
answer.
this
case
was
brought
as
a
bill
of
review.
our
position
is
that
was
the
inappropriate
remedy.
the
remedy
that
they
should
have
pursued
would
have
been
any
of
a
variety
of
collateral
attacks,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
declaratory
judgment.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
your
honor--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--all
right.
first,
your
honor,
that
question
has
not
been
presented
properly
to
this
court
because
the
state
court
in
texas
has
not
had
an
opportunity
to
say
after
they
have
pursued
the
correct
appeal
that
there
is
no
avenue
of
collateral
attack.
there
is
law
in
texas,
so
that
all
of
the
justices
of
the
court
understand
this,
and
i'm
not
misleading
the
court,
there
is
law
in
texas
to
the
effect
that
a
recitation
in
the
judgment
controls.
there
is
also
a
law
in
texas
to
the
effect
that
the
record
controls.
there
is
also
a
law
in
texas,
however,
that
if
a
recitation
of
judgment
conflicts
with
the
record,
specifically
in
this
case,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
according
to
what
we
must
accept
true
a
defective
service,
there
is
law
in
texas
which
says
that
the
court
can
consider
that.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
certainly,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
would
think
that
the
texas
courts
should
be
given
the
opportunity.
the
commander
v.
bryan
case
is
a
very
old
case.
it's
a
1938
case
that's
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
a
bit
difficult
to
get
through,
but,
basically,
what
the
commander
v.
bryan
case
does
is
take
on
the
problem
that
is
addressed
and
then
says
that
this
presents
possibly
a
due
process
question.
the
commander
v.
bryan
case
has
never
been
overruled.
it's
never
been
strongly
followed.
so
far
as
our
research
indicates,
there
is
no
case,
surprisingly,
by
our
high
court
or
even
our
intermediate
courts
where
the
constitutional
due
process
challenge
to
a
collateral
attack
has
ever
been
overturned.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
i
defend
the
opinion.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
yes,
sir.
i
do.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
no,
sir,
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
justice
evans
would
have
said
that
either
when
he
wrote
the
opinion.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
nor
do
i
think
he
had--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--no,
sir.
respectfully.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
in
his
first
argument,
where
he
says
that
there
is
a
collateral
attack
that
is
available.
all
right.
there
is
no
specific
rule
or
procedure
that
provides
for
collateral
attack,
but
there
is
a
massive
body
of
case
law
in
texas
that
provides
for
collateral
attack
stemming
from
the
premise
in
austin
independent
school
district
v.
the
sierra
club
and
others
that
says
that
a
judgment
without
jurisdiction
is
void
and
can
be
attacked,
and
i
believe
what
the
attorney
general...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
believe
what
the
attorney
general
was
saying
was
that
the
collateral
attack
is
available
and
then
he
goes
on,
i
think
principally
for
the
help
of
the
court,
to
explain
what
the
direct
attack
remedies
are
and
maybe
there
is
a
lack
of
clarity
in
the
brief.
but
his
point,
and
i
think
it
is
an
accurate
point,
is
that
this
judgment
can
be
and
should
have
been,
if
there
is
any
merit
at
all
in
what
they're
doing,
presented
as
a
collateral
attack.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
under
texas
law,--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--all
right,
not
to
be
splitting
hairs,
your
honor,
but
a
void
judgment
is
that.
it's
not
a
cloud
on
anything.
it's
a
void
judgment.
it's
a
legal
nullity.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
well,
justice
stevens,
if
i
could
make
a
comment,
none
of
this
execution
aspect
of
the
case
was
in
the
record.
all
of
that
is
a
result
of
the
briefing.
my
understanding
of
the--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--your
honor,
if
there
was
a
judgment
on
the
books,
it
could
have
been--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--well,
the
point
is,
your
honor,
immediately
upon
receipt
of
any
notification
that
any
attempt
was
made
to
execute
on
the
judgment,
they
could
have
done
a
wide
variety
of
things,
which,
to
this
point,
they
still
have
not
done.
there
is
no
suit
on
file
at
all
attacking
the
execution
because,
in
point
of
fact,
your
honor,
they
did
not
own
the
property
when
the
alleged
execution
sale
took
place.
this
deed
that's
the
subject
of
the
attack
that's
going
on
right
now
was
actually
granted
before
the
execution
sale.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
but,
your
honor,
isn't
the...
assuming--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--well,
i'm
apparently
not
explaining
myself
well,
your
honor.
it's
clear
to
me,
but
i
will
try
again.
the
direct
attack
procedure
is
set
up
for
people
who
have
defenses.
all
right.
so
that
they
can
assert
their
defenses.
a
direct
attack
permits
you
to
change
the
judgment.
a
collateral
attack
is
available
for
people
who
have
no
defenses
but
who
have
a
technical
thing
that
they
can
use.
the
technical
thing
in
this
case
is
that,
according
to
them,
the
judgment
is
void,
and
i'm
not
meaning
to
trivialize
technical,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
they
don't
have
a
defense
to
this
action.
they
admit
they
don't
have
a
defense
to
this
action.
so,
the
point
is
that
is
the
remedy
adequate,
and
our
position
is
since
they
have
a
collateral
attack
remedy,
which
means
that
the
moment
they
find
out
about
this
void
judgment,
they
can
avoid
the
consequences
of
that
judgment,
that
this
remedy
meets
the
due
process
requirements.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
justice
scalia,
my
response
to
that
is,
and
i
start
to
understand,
sir,
from
the
premise
that
if,
as
we
must
accept,
the
judgment
that
we're
dealing
with
is
a
void
judgment,
all
right,
then
that
particular
type
of
judgment,
one
that
is
void
as
a
matter
of
the
law
of
our
jurisdiction,
all
right,
cannot
be
a
taking
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
your
honor,
while
that,
in
the
abstract
and
in
the
important
abstract,
may
be
true,
my
belief
is
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
court
and
the
only
thing
that
the
record
in
this
court
enables
the
united
states
supreme
court
to
deal
with
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
very
specific
procedure,
which
is
designed
for
a
very
specific
purpose,
not
this
purpose.
it's
designed
for
those
people
who,
through
no
fault
of
their
own,
have
been
wrongfully
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
present
their
defense,
and
if
they
meet
the
specific
aspects
of
the
bill
of
review
procedure,
then
they're
entitled
to
bill
of
review
relief.
what
happened
in
this
case,
i
suggest,
is
that
the
avenues
that
texas
does
provide
for
dealing
with
a
void
judgment,
such
as,
for
example,
the
declaratory
judgment,
simply
were
not
pursued.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
it's
my
position,
your
honor,
(1)
that
he
could,
(2)
that
in
all
honesty
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court
and
is
not
briefed
and
i
really
cannot
presume
to
speak
for
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
your
honor,--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--your
honor,--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--i
don't
think
i
did
that
because,
first
of
all,
i
have
not
really
agreed
that
this
is
a
way
to
attack
a
void
judgment
when
you
have
no
defense.
i
thought,
in
fact,
i
know
that
my
intended
point
is
that
this
is
not
even
a
way
to
attack
a
void
judgment
unless
you
have
a
meritorious
defense.
i
thought
my
other
point,
however,
your
honor,
was
that
there
are
many
ways
under
texas
law
that
a
void
default
judgment
can
be
attacked.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
all
right.
your
honor
will
note
that
the
attorney
general
in
its
brief
said
that
the
judgment
can
be
attacked
collaterally,
that
judgment
can
be
attacked
collaterally
as
opposed
to
the
enforcement.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--i
think,
though,
that
at
least
from
my
point
of
argument,
that
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
the
point
is
that
so
long
as
the
deprivation,
the
contended
deprivation,
the
taking
of
liberty
or
the
taking
of
property
can
be
addressed,
then
there
is
no
due
process
problem.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
none
caused
by
the
inadequacies
of
the
remedy,
particularly
the
inadequacies--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--not
a
void
judgment,
your
honor.
no,
sir.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
your
honor,
i
will
accept
the
court's
statement
on
that.
i
did
not
respond
well
to
the
court's
earlier
question
as
to
why
the
court
has
done
that
in
other
cases,
but
i
just
cannot
see
the
deprivation,
perhaps
because
i
am,
from
my
side
of
the
table,
blind
to
it.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
not
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
the
judgment
by--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
no,
because
a
void
judgment
does
not
constitute
a
taking
of
property.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
but,
your
honor,
isn't
this
really
a
paul
v.
davis
situation,
where
the
most
that
can
be
said
of
a
void
judgment
is
that
it
has
an
effect
on
the
reputation
alone?
it
does
not
change
the
legal
status.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
your
honor,
a
couple
of
responses
to
that
is
that
the
liberty
issue,
which
i
think
the...
at
least
in
my
respect,
the
court
is
addressing
here,
we
have
asserted
in
our
brief
was
not
properly
raised
below.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
your
honor,
a
void
judgment,
and
here
i
know
that
i'm
being
obnoxiously
repetitive,
but
a
void
judgment
that
has
no
legal
effect
under
texas
law
cannot
constitute
a
taking
of
property
except
for
a
pure
reputational
interest,
which,
as
i
understand
the
paul
v.
davis
case,
states
is
not
a
taking
of
liberty
so
as
to
invoke
the
due
process.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
well,--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--your
honor,
since
my
brief
has
been
properly
thrown
at
me,
on
page
6
of
my
opponent's
brief,
they
say
that
this
judgment
is...
pardon
me.
the
citation
is
void
on
its
face.
if
that
is
true,
as
the
attorney
general
says,--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--which
i
think--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--but
you
can't
do
anything
with
it.
from
our
point
of...
from
our
side
of
the
table,
your
honor,
i
understand
that
side
of
the
table's
argument,
but
from
our
side
of
the
table,
if
we
accept
what
they
say
could
be
true
as
we
must,
then
we
have
a
void
judgment
that
is
not
worth
anything
to
us.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
not...
your
honor,
the
property
was
sold.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
to
clear
title,
it
was,
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
it
was
foreclosed
on
by
someone
else
first.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
the
deed
record
was
transferred.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
i
hope
i
would
have
done
something
before
we
reached
this
point,
your
honor,
in
to
looking
into
whether
the
judgment
was
valid
or
not.
justice
white,--
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
--i
wasn't
representing
him
then,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor,
and
we
still
contend
the
judgment
is
not
useless,
but
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
we
are
assuming
that
it's
void.
justice
white,
in
your
dissenting
opinion
in
the
gertz
case,
you
stated
that
our
constitutional,
or
words
to
this
effect,
that
our
constitutional
scheme
demands
a
proper
respect
for
the
roles
of
the
state
in
discharging
their
obligation
to
obey
the
constitution.
i
think
that
the
state
of
texas
is
entitled
to
that
respect
in
this
case.
the
only
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
did
was
to
rule
on
the
specific
procedure
under
which
the
appellates
tried
to
make
a
claim
in
this
case,
a
procedure
that,
your
honor,
expands
the
rights
of
victims
of
default
judgments
rather
than
attempts
to
limit
it
in
some
form
or
fashion.
this
is
a
procedure
that
has
been
on
the
books
of
texas
for
a
long
time,
and
i
think
it's
entitled
to
deference
in
this
case,
particularly
in
light
of
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
balancing
test.
thank
you.
mr.
jack
e.
urquhart
among
other
things,
yes,
sir.
this
court,
in
carey
v.
piphus,
has
said
that
it
is
of
no
force
and
effect
to
say
that
the
same
result
would
happen.
due
process
of
law
does
not
turn
on
whether
or
not
you
have
a
meritorious
defense.
it
would
be
like
the
"legal
eagles"
movie
where
they
said,
well,
let's
give
them
a
fair
trial
before
we
hang
them.
due
process
of
law
requires
that
you
do
give
us
a
fair
trial
before
you
deprive
us
of
a
right
or
a
liberty,
even
if
we're
wrong.
that's
the
purpose.
the
integrity
of
the
system
of
justice
relies
upon
us
having
notice
and
ample
opportunity
to
be
heard,
even
if
it
is
to
say
that
we're
wrong.
that
is
what
due
process
of
law
is
about.
it
is
about
the
procedures
that
guarantee
the
liberties
of
this
country
versus
france,
where
you're
guilty
until
you
prove
yourself
innocent,
and
that
is
the
same
situation
here.
