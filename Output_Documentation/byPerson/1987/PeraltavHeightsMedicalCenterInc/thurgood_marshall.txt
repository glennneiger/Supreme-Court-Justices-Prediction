justice
marshall
exactly
what
section
of
the
constitution
do
you
rely
on?
justice
marshall
would
you
explain
how
you
get
under
that?
justice
marshall
was
that
point
raised?
justice
marshall
was
it
raised
here?
justice
marshall
i
thought
all
you
were
raising
here
is
the
rule
was
wrong.
justice
marshall
the
texas
rule
is
wrong.
not
that
your
case
was
wrong.
justice
marshall
am
i
correct
that
you
all
you
are
objecting
to
is
the
rule?
justice
marshall
you
think
so.
justice
marshall
and,
then,
in
order
to
rule
with
you,
we
have
to
think
that
way.
justice
marshall
you
do?
justice
marshall
i
just
don't
see
any
federal
question
in
the
case.
you're
unhappy.
that's
all.
justice
marshall
are
you
trying
to
use
this
case
to
decide
that
other
one?
justice
marshall
the
one
you
have
pending
right
now.
justice
marshall
do
you
agree
that
we
can't
decide
that
case
now?
justice
marshall
then,
why
do
you
keep
arguing
that?
justice
marshall
why
do
you
keep
arguing
it?
why
do
you
keep
bringing
it
up?
justice
marshall
just
then
you
brought
it
up.
do
you
need
that
case
to
win
this
one?
justice
marshall
but
what
do
you
need...
you
need
to
show
how
the
state
denied
you
due
process.
justice
marshall
and
the
only
thing
you
say
is
the
rule
is
a
bad
rule.
justice
marshall
were
you
in
the
armstrong
case?
justice
marshall
were
you
in
the
armstrong
case?
justice
marshall
i
said
i
was
just
wondering.
justice
marshall
i'm
just
at
a
loss
as
to
what
the
federal
question
is.
justice
marshall
but
you
didn't
try
it.
justice
marshall
you
tried
it
one
way.
you
didn't
try
it
the
other
way.
