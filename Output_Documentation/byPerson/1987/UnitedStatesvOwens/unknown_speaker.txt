unknown
speaker
did
he
remember
what
owens
looked
like
at
the
time
he
was
testifying?
but
he
remembered
identifying
him
in
the
hospital,
did
he
remember
what
the
picture
looked
like
that
he
identified
as--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
would
he
have
been
able
to
pick
it
out
in
the
courtroom?
unknown
speaker
he
remembered
that
he
picked
that
picture
out
in
the
hospital?
unknown
speaker
but
he
has
got
a
picture
in
his
mind
of
what
the
picture
was
that
he
picked
out.
unknown
speaker
and
he
remembers
that
he...
at
that
time
thought
that
that
picture
was
his
assailant.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bryson,
is
that
recollection
that
the
man
had
sufficient
to
qualify
him
under
the
rule
of
evidence
602
that
the
witness
may
not
testify
as
to
a
matter
unless
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
show
he
has
personal
knowledge
of
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
district
court
never
ruled
on
that
did
it?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
okay,
right.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
we
need
to
do
with
regard
to
rule
602?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
typically
you
don't
get
to
the
constitutional
question
if
you
can
go
off
on
some
other
ground.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
bryson,
didn't
fensterer
as
screened
leave
open
this
question?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
rely
on
fensterer.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bryson,
can
i
interrupt
you
to
ask
you
a
question
about
your
hypothetical?
you
do
agree,
i
take
it,
that
the
associate
who
heard
you
say
"that's
jones"
could
not
testify
to
that
fact?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
did
the
fbi
agent
testify?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
bryson,
i
gather
if
owens
had
died
after
the
fbi
interview
and
before
the
trial,
the
agent
could
not
have
testified.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
case
didn't
owens
finally
die?
unknown
speaker
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
the
extent
admittedly
critical,
then
why
is
this
any
different
than
had
owens
died?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
is...
the
most
crucial
fact
here
was
the
identification.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bryson,
if
rule
804
says
a
witness
is
unavailable
when
he
doesn't
recall
the
substance
of
his
prior
statements,
then
how
can
the
same
witness
be
subject
to
cross
examination
for
purposes
of
rule
801?
do
you
plan
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
he
could
also
be
asked
whether
or
not
he
remembers
the
defendant
who
is
sitting
there
in
the
courtroom,
does
he
remember
him
as
the
one
who--
unknown
speaker
--he
is
the
same
one
as
in
the
picture.
unknown
speaker
what
it
says
under
the
rule
is
that
the
cross
examination
contemplated
must
be
sufficient
to
provide
the
jury
with
an
adequate
basis
for
assessing
the
reliability
and
truthfulness
of
the
statement.
is
that
satisfied
here?
unknown
speaker
do
you
argue
that
as
an
alternate
basis
for
affirmance
in
your
brief
here,
mr.
ides,
the
601
point?
unknown
speaker
602
point.
unknown
speaker
but
you
haven't
really
relied
on
it
as
an
alternate
basis
for
affirmance?
unknown
speaker
that
will
be
the
next
case,
though,
if
we
decide
this
case
the
way
you
want
us
to.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
this
from
the
bank
teller
example
that
government
counsel
gave?
unknown
speaker
or
would
that
be
covered
as
well?
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
asked
the
bank
teller,
was
the
lighting
bright
or
dim,
and
he
says,
gee,
i
can't
remember
that.
did
you
see
him
for
30
seconds
or
a
minute?
gee,
i
really
can't
remember.
did
you
see
him
head
on
or
profile?
gee,
i
really
can't
remember
that.
all
she
really
remembers
is
that
she
saw
him
well
enough
to
identify
him
and
did
identify
him
at
a
later
time.
would
that
come
within
your
rule
here
or
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
she
doesn't
remember.
she
doesn't
remember
whether
it
was
bright
or
dim.
she
hasn't
given
any
information
on
these
subjects.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
chief
justice's
concern
is
a
real
one.
how
much
does
the
teller
have
to
remember
about
the
actual
identification
day
in
order
not
to
fall
within
the
rule
you
are
espousing?
unknown
speaker
but
how
does
that
make
cross
examination
effective?
all
she
says
is,
i
remember
i
saw
him.
did
you
see
him
profile
or
head
on?
was
he
close
or
far?
i
don't
remember
any
of
that.
all
i
remember
is
that
i
saw
him.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
that
distinguishes
this
case.
what
i
am
asking
is,
why
that
should
make
a
difference
between
one
teller
who
remembers
no
more
than
that
and
the
next
one
who
remembers
one
additional
factor.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
confining
it
to
the
confrontation
clause
and
putting
these
rules
to
one
side
for
a
moment--
unknown
speaker
--supposing
that
immediately
or
even
during
the
interview
with
the
fbi
agent,
right
after
saying,
identifying
his
assailant,
supposing
he
had
died,
so
you
have
a
dying
declaration,
and
they
tried
to
put
in
the...
through
the
fbi
agent
what
he
had
said.
a,
would
you
think
that
would
violate
the
confrontation
clause,
and
if
not,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
case?
unknown
speaker
so
all
dying
declarations
violate
the
confrontation
clause?
unknown
speaker
i
am
hypothesizing
a
dying
declaration
where
you
have
no
reason
to
believe
there
was
any
motive
to
lie,
which
i
think
is
this
case.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
claim
that
this
man
was
not
credible
to
the
extent--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
do
have
total
absence
of
ability
to
find
out
why
the
declarant
concluded
that
the
person
he
or
she
identified
was
the
assailant.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
some
fact
that
indicates
the
grounds
for
his
identification
through
the
photograph,
i
suppose.
didn't
he
know
owens?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
not
only
looked
at
the
photograph
and
says,
that's
the
man
who
assaulted
me,
but
his
name
is
owens.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
you
say
there
is
a
fatal
absence
here
of...
how
did
you
know
it
was
owens?
at
the
time,
in
the
hospital.
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
there
should
be
some
basis
for
asking
him,
how
did
you
know
it
was
owens?
unknown
speaker
so
he
didn't...
he
couldn't
answer
any
reason,
give
any
reason
for
identifying
owens
in
that
picture?
unknown
speaker
he
said,
i
may
not
have
seen
him.
unknown
speaker
i
may
not
have
seen
him.
i
may
just
have
smelled
him,
or
listened
to
his
voice.
unknown
speaker
you
put
all
the
weight
on
he
wasn't
asked.
whose
duty
was
it
to
ask?
unknown
speaker
was
that
necessary?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
emphasize
it
if
it
wasn't
necessary?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
after
he
said
this
is
joe
dokes,
he
wrote
it
down
in
a
note
to
his
brother.
would
that
help
him?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
couldn't
you
have
asked
the
question
without
anybody
saying
anything?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so,
what
is
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
this
witness
could
just
as
easily
say,
yes,
i
identified
him,
and
told
a
lie,
and
then
everything
would
be
all
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
your
distinction,
if
i
understand
you,
with
fensterer,
is
that
that
testimony
is
more...
it
is
easier
to
admit
that
because
it
is
less
credible.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
basis
for
questioning
the
reliability
has
been
established,
namely,
he
didn't
remember
the
basis
for
the
conclusion.
that
is
exactly
what
you
have
here.
unknown
speaker
this
goes
to
the
ability
of
the
victim
as
a
witness.
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
ability
of
the
witness
to
testify
to
the
truth
of
the
ultimate
proposition.
in
both
cases
they
are
unable
to
do
so
because
they
can't
explain
the
basis
for
their
conclusion.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
only
part
of
it.
the
ultimate
question
is,
is
his
opinion
one
we
should
accept?
unknown
speaker
and
one
of
the
arguments
for
not
accepting
him
is,
he
is
not
a
good
expert
if
he
doesn't
keep
records
and
keep
track
of
why
he
reaches
his
conclusion.
he
is
not
a
very
good
witness
for
that
proposition.
you
can
make
the
same
argument--
unknown
speaker
--why
not?
he
certainly
is.
he
is
a
much
less
reliable
witness
than
one
who
could
say,
i
saw
him.
unknown
speaker
you
are
certainly
free
to
make
all
the
arguments
to
the
jury
about
the
unreliability
of
that
kind
of
evidence
as
to,
you
know...
all
the
arguments
you
are
making
to
us
you
could
also
make
to
the
jury,
and
they
are
not
unable
to
understand
the
nuances
of
this
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
ides--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
at
the
time
he
made
the
photo
identification
the
officer
had
asked
him,
did
you
see
him,
how
long
did
you
see
him,
et
cetera,
and
he
answered
fully,
and
at
trial
he
remembered
that
very
conversation,
and
said,
yes,
i
did
say
that,
but
i
don't
remember
now
whether
i
saw
him
or
not,
would
your
case
be
any
different?
unknown
speaker
why
would
it
be
different?
unknown
speaker
could
this
have
been
cured
by
instruction?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
it
should
have
been
excluded?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
he
couldn't
cross
examine
on
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
is
excluded
you
couldn't
cross
examine.
unknown
speaker
xxx
identification?
unknown
speaker
what
have
we
got
to
do
with
the
box?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ides,
let
me
get
back
to
the
bank
teller
again.
you
say
it
makes
the
difference
if
the
bank
teller
just
says,
i
don't
remember
anything
about
it.
all
i
remember
is
that
i
saw
him.
that
would
be
enough
to
get
that
out
of
the
rule
that
you
are
urging
on
us.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
so
it
is
going
to
come
to
a
case
by
case,
we
really
can't--
unknown
speaker
--take
the
effective
cross
examination
on
a
case
by
case
analysis,
just
not
for
600
district
judges
in
the
federal
system
that
are
conducting
trials,
but
for
thousands
and
thousands
of
state
court
judges
that
are
conducting
trials.
unknown
speaker
xxx
for
600
federal
judges.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question,
following
up
on
justice
scalia's
thought?
if
one
of
the
other
witnesses,
not
the
victim
himself,
has
testified
that
they
were
facing
one
another
when
the
assault
occurred,
then
would
you
agree
that
his
testimony
would
be
admissible?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
say
the
other
witness
meets
the
indicia
of
reliability,
no
bias,
and
so
forth,
i
am
not
sure...
then
you
would
say
it
would
still
be
inadmissible,
the
victim's
testimony
would
still
be
inadmissible?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that.
i
just
don't
understand
what
you
have
said.
if
another
witness...
you
were
in
some
doubt
when
the
witness
who
forgets
the
whole
thing
says,
i
really
can't
say
whether
i
saw
it.
i
asked
you,
suppose
that
witness
remembers
only
that
i
saw
the
individual,
i
don't
remember
how,
i
don't
remember
what
the
light
was,
i
don't
remember
anything
else,
i
saw
him.
you
are
not
sure
whether
that
would
satisfy
the
rule,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
there
never
is
when
there
is
a
memory
loss.
unknown
speaker
that
is
pretty
effective
itself,
you
are
saying,
to
be
able
to
point
out
that
he
doesn't
remember
the
basis
for
his
identification.
