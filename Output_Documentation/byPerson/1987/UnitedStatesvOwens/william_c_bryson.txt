mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
or
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
bar
the
admission
of
a
witness's
prior
identification
of
his
assailant
on
the
ground
that
at
the
time
of
the
trial
the
witness
had
suffered
a
loss
of
memory
concerning
the
facts
of
the
assault.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows.
the
case
arose
from
a
prosecution
of
the
respondent
owens,
who
is
a
federal
prisoner,
for
assault
against
a
federal
correctional
officer,
john
foster,
at
the
lompoc
penitentiary
in
california.
the
assault
occurred
on
the
morning
of
april
12th,
1982,
and
it
consisted
of
a
series
of
blows
to
the
head
and
arms
of
foster
that
left
him
with
very
severe
head
injuries.
foster
was
immediately
taken
to
the
hospital
and
spent
about
a
month
in
the
hospital,
during
which
time
he
suffered
periods
of
grogginess
and
virtual
incoherence,
but
during
some
period
of
which
he
was
relatively
lucid
and
coherent,
particularly
towards
the
end
of
the
period,
in
fact,
on
may
5th,
1982,
foster
was
visited
by
an
fbi
agent,
who
interviewed
him
to
determine
as
much
as
he
could
about
the
events
of
the
assault.
at
that
time,
according
to
both
foster's
testimony
at
trial
and
according
to
the
fbi
agent's
testimony,
foster
gave
a
statement
that
described
in
great
detail
all
the
events
leading
up
to
the
assault
and
the
facts
of
the
assault,
including
identifying
the
respondent
owens
as
his
assailant.
he
identified
owens
and
then
he
also
picked
owens
out
of
a
photo
lineup
as
his
assailant.
now,
at
trial,
by
the
time
trial
came
around
about
a
year
and
a
half
later,
foster
had
suffered
a
memory
loss
to
some
degree
about
the
events
of
the
assault.
he
was
able
to
remember
much
of
the
background
of
what
had
happened
that
day.
he
was
able
to
remember
some
of
the
facts
of
what
had
happened
when
he
went
into
the
tv
room
where
he
was
assaulted.
but
the
critical
fact
that
he
couldn't
remember
was
the
identity
of
his
assailant.
he
could
not
remember
in
trial,
he
could
not
identify
owens
as
his
assailant.
however,
he
could
remember,
and
indeed
he
said
he
remembered
vividly
the
statement
that
he
made
to
agent
mansfield,
the
fbi
agent
who
had
interviewed
him
at
the
hospital.
he
remembered
that
statement,
and
in
particular
he
remembered
both
that
he
had
identified
owens
as
his
assailant
at
that
time,
that
he
had
identified
owens
from
the
photo
id
and
that
he
was
confident
at
that
time
that
his
identification
was
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he
remembered
picking
out
that
particular
picture,
yes.
he
was
familiar--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--he
would
have
been
able
to
pick
that
picture
out
as
owens,
but
what
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
do
in
the
courtroom
was
to
pick
that
picture
out
as
his
assailant
based
on
his
memory
at
the
time
of
trial.
in
other
words--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
that's
correct,
and
he
knew
that
he
picked
out
owens,
he
knew
what
owens
looked
like.
what
he
was
unable
to
say,
and
this
is
a
mark
in
a
sense
of
the
precision
of
his
testimony,
was
that
he
was
able
to
say,
no,
that
i
said
it
was
owens
at
the
time,
but
he
said,
i
honestly
cannot
tell
you
now
that
based
on
my
current
recollection
that
i
have
a
picture
in
my
mind
of
the
assailant
being
owens.
he
remembered
a
great
deal
about
the
assault,
but--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
precisely,
and
he
was
confident
that
he
was
right
at
that
time,
but
of
course,
because
he
has
no
current
recollection
of
the
identity
of
the
assailant,
that
is
to
say,
the
person
who
actually
assaulted
him
at
the
time,
because
he
has
no
recollection
of
that,
he
can't
honestly
say,
yes,
the
person
who
assaulted
me
was
owens,
except
to
the
extent
he
can
say
that
the
statement
that
i
made
i
believed
at
the
time
to
be
accurate
and
i
was
confident--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
we
believe
that
rule
602
is
satisfied
here
for
several
reasons,
including
the
testimony
that
foster
gave
on
the
stand.
of
course,
rule
602
allows
personal
knowledge
to
be
established
by
means
other
than
the
testimony
of
the
declarant,
but
i
would
have
to
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
includes
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent,
felt
that
rule
602
had
not
been
satisfied,
the
majority
didn't
find
it
necessary
to
dispose
of
the
case
on
that
ground
because
of
the
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
district
court
did
conclude
that
there
was
a
basis
for
personal
knowledge.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
that
conclusion--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--on
the
ground
that
they
felt
that
there
was
a
disparity
between
the
offer
of
proof
that
was
made
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
and
the
actual
proof
that
came
in,
but
we
feel
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
rule
on
rule
602.
it
would
seem
to
me
if
the
court
reverses
on
the
confrontation
clause
and
the
rule
801(d)(1)(c)
issues
that
are
before
the
court,
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
send
the
case
back
in
any
event
to
the
court
of
appeals,
which
can
then
decide
whether
a
further
remand
is
necessary.
they
may
not
think
it
necessary
on
the
harmless
error
ground,
but--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
in
this
case,
however,
we
would
be
content...
we
think
it
is
possible
for
this
court
to
decide,
if
the
court
wants
to,
that
rule
605
is
satisfied.
on
the
other
hand,
since
judge
boochever
in
dissent
felt,
as
did
the
majority,
that
rule
602
was
not
satisfied,
it
may
be
necessary
in
this
case...
the
court
may
prefer
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
further
development
of
the
rule
602
issue,
which
in
judge
boochever's
view
would
have
required
a
further
remand
to
the
district
court,
and
we
wouldn't
have
any
objection
to
that,
although
i
would
like
to
point
out
a
few
facts
that
would
support
a
finding
and
indeed
do
support
a
finding
of
the
district
court
that
rule
602
was
satisfied,
one
of
which
is
that
the
testimony
that
owens
gave
from
the
stand
and
testimony
that
was
in
his
statement
that
he
jammed
his
finger
into
the
chest
of
his
assailant,
which
suggests
that
he
was
facing
his
assailant.
number
2,
the
location
of
his
injuries.
his
injuries
were
on
the
front
of
his
body,
and
they
were
injuries
to
the
side
of
his
head
and
injuries
to
his
arms,
which
were
obviously
in
a
defensive
posture,
indicating
he
was
facing
his
assailant.
he
commented
that
he
knew
that...
or
believed
that
the
instrument
that
had
been
used
to
injure
him
was
a
pipe
because
of
its
size,
and
that
indicates
that
he
must
have
seen
the
pipe.
also,
there
was
an
eye
witness.
i
think
it
was
inmate
jeffery
who
testified
that
the
two
were
facing
one
another.
now,
that
is
not
a
statement
by
the
witness
from
the
stand
that,
yes,
i
saw
my
assailant,
but
it
is
circumstantial
evidence
from
which
the
district
court's
finding
on
rule
602
could
be
supported.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
reach
that
question
because
it
was
left
up
in
the
air
by
the
court
of
appeals.
however,
i
do
think
there
is
an
ample
basis
on
which
the
court
either
could
reach
that
question
or
the
court
of
appeals
could
dispose
of
it
either
on
their
own
or
the
issue
could
be
disposed
of
by
the
district
court
on
further
remand,
which
is
what
judge
boochever
would
have
suggested.
now,
the
district
court
admitted
the
evidence
that
was
offered,
which
is
the
out
of
court
statement
made
by
mr.
foster
on
may
5th
on
the
ground
that
foster
was
there,
available
for
cross
examination,
and
therefore
the
confrontation
clause
and
rule
801(b)(1)(c),
which
is
the
rule
that
is
designed
to
permit
prior
identification
testimony
in
over
hearsay
objection,
that
both
were
satisfied
by
foster's
availability
for
cross
examination.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
both
on
the
confrontation
clause
issue
and
on
the
rule
801(d)(1)(c)
question
because
in
their
view
the
cross
examination
that
was
available
in
this
case
of
foster
due
to
his
memory
loss
was
just
constitutionally
and
under
the
rules
insufficient,
was
insufficiently
effective
to
satisfy
the
confrontation
clause,
and
it
was
insufficient
to
satisfy
the
rule.
our
view
is
that,
turning
first
to
the
confrontation
clause,
that
memory
loss
on
the
subject
of
an
out
of
court
statement
should
not
be
a
bar
to
the
admission
of
that
out
of
court
statement.
now,
the
purposes
of
confrontation
clause
are,
the
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions,
both
to
allow
the
witness
to
confront,
physically
confront...
excuse
me,
the
defendant
to
physically
confront
the
witnesses
against
him
in
court,
and,
of
course,
part
and
parcel
of
that
is,
have
an
opportunity
for
cross
examination
of
the
witnesses.
now,
the
fact
of
memory
loss
does
not
in
our
view
interfere
with
those
basic
principles
of
the
confrontation
clause.
memory
loss
is
a
fact
of
life
in
criminal
and
civil
cases.
there
is
typically
some
memory
loss
in
virtually
every
case,
particularly
if
a
case
comes
on
for
trial
a
year,
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
fact,
even
if
there
has
been
no
trauma,
as
there
was
in
this
case,
and
even
if
there
is
no
intentional
effort
to
dissemble
on
the
part
of
the
witness,
as
there
has
been
in
some
other
courts
of
appeals'
cases,
still
there
is
going
to
be
memory
loss
on
the
part
of
a
witness.
that
memory
loss
does
not
render
the
cross
examination
ineffective.
in
some
respects
it
may
render
cross
examination
more
difficult.
on
the
other
hand,
in
some
respects
it
makes
cross
examination
more
fruitful,
because
obviously
if
you
can
demonstrate
that
a
witness
has
a
shaky
memory
about
the
events,
it
can
often
be
very
useful
in
persuading
the
jury
that
in
fact
this
witness
is
not
very
observant,
doesn't
hold
facts
in
his
mind
very
well,
that
this
is
not
a
careful
person,
and
that
this
is
a
person
who
is
apt
to
have
made
either
a
mistake
or
be
now
guilty
of
a
failure
of
recollection.
now,
in
our
view,
based
on
these
principles,
we
would
say
that
the
confrontation
clause
is
satisfied
if,
number
one,
the
scope
of
the
cross
examination
is
not
improperly
restricted
by
the
district
court
or
by
statute
or
rule.
this
is
a
principle
that
comes
from
this
court's
decisions
in
cases
like
davis
against
alaska.
number
two,
if
the
witness
is
competent,
that
is
to
say,
if
the
witness
is
able
to
engage
in
a
question
and
answer
dialogue,
if
the
witness
is
mentally
and
physically
able
to
engage
in
cross
examination.
and
number
three,
if
the
witness
does
in
fact
engage
in
this
cross
examination
process
by
answering
questions
as
opposed
to
simply
refusing
to
answer
questions
altogether.
now,
the
respondent
contends
that
in
this
case
the
problem
with
the...
the
confrontational
problem
is
much
worse
than
it
is
when
you
are
talking
about
a
witness
who
is
testifying
about
matters
that
he
observed
that
he
is
testifying
in
court
but
has
suffered
loss
of
memory
with
respect
to
those
matters.
he
concedes
for
the
most
part,
i
think,
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause
if,
as
in
a
case
such
as
this
court's
decision
in
delaware
against
fensterer,
the
witness
simply
has
a
shaky
memory
as
to
some
events
as
to
which
he
is
testifying.
even
if
there
is
a
substantial
loss
of
memory
on
the
part
of
the
witness
so
that
the
witness
as,
again,
in
delaware
against
fensterer,
says,
well,
i
know
what
my
opinion
is
but
i
can't
remember
any
of
the
reasons
why
i
reached
that
opinion,
because
he
is
testifying
about
his
current
opinion
in
court,
the
respondent
says,
that
is
different
from
this
case,
where
the
witness
is
not
testifying
about
his
in
court
observations,
or
is
testifying
about
his
observations,
while
he
is
standing
there
is
present
recollection
of
his
observations
while
he
is
in
court,
but
is
testifying
about
an
out
of
court
statement.
in
our
view,
there
is
no
such
clearcut
line
to
be
drawn
between
an
out
of
court
statement
and
in
court
testimony
about
one's
current
recollection,
and
i
think
the
example
that
perhaps
can
best
make
this
point--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
certainly
did,
your
honor.
this
case
is
here--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--we
rely
on
it,
your
honor,
because
we
think
the
analysis,
while
the
question
was
clearly
left
open,
we
think
that
the
analysis
of
fensterer
is
helpful
in
indicating
the
way
that
that
question
should
be
answered.
we
certainly
concede
that
that
question
has
been
left
open
and
this
court
has
never
answered
the
question,
but
we
do
think
that
features
of
fensterer
suggest
the
answer
that
this
court
should
reach.
the
difference,
the
absence
of
any
significant
difference
between
the
two
kinds
of
statements
it
seems
to
me
is
perhaps
best
pointed
out
by
the
following
example.
suppose
i
am
walking
down
the
street
and
someone
comes
out
of
a
bank
wearing
a
mask.
enough
of
the
face
is
showing
so
that
i
can
recognize
the
person,
and
i
say
to
myself,
well,
that
is
jones
coming
out
of
the
bank.
there
is
a
person
standing
with
me
as
i
say
that.
now,
trial
time
comes,
and
by
the
time
of
trial
i
have
forgotten
a
lot
about
what
happened.
two
different
events
can
occur.
either
i
can
get
into
trial
and
the
prosecutor
can
ask
me,
who
came
out
of
the
bank,
and
i
will
say
to
myself,
i
don't
remember
much
about
the
incident,
i
don't
remember
much
about
that
day,
but
i
remember
saying
to
myself
and
thinking,
that's
jones,
my
recollection
is
now,
in
court
testimony
of
the
fensterer
sort.
a
second
thing
that
could
happen
is,
i
could
say,
well,
i
remember
saying
to
my
associate,
that's
jones
coming
out
of
the
bank.
now,
if
i
have
forgotten
the
basis,
in
large
part
or
in
whole,
of
either
of
those
two
statements,
either
the
one
i
made
to
myself,
in
effect,
or
the
one
i
made
to
my
associate,
if
i
have
forgotten
why
it
was
that
i
made
those
statements,
fensterer
would
still
allow
the
admission
of
the
first
statement.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
real
difference
between
that
and
the
admission
of
the
second
statement,
that
the
degree
of
the
effectiveness
of
cross
examination,
the
way
the
cross
examination
would
go
would
not
be
in
any
significant
degree
different
in
those
two
cases.
we
don't
see
a
reason
to
draw
a
line
between
those
two
cases.
now,
the
case
is
harder,
of
course,
if
in
fact
the
witness
himself
has
no
recollection
of
the
prior
statements
other
than
the
prior
statement
has
to
come
in
through
a
third
party.
but
even
in
that
case,
which
is
not
this
case,
in
this
case
there
was
a
prior
recollection
by
the
witness
of
the
statement,
even
in
that
case
there
is
fruitful
line
of
cross
examination
that
can
be
engaged
in.
for
example,
the
witness
could
be
probed
for
bias.
the
witness's
general
credibility
can
be
probed
under
cross
examination.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
we
would
think
that
the
associate
could
testify,
your
honor,
under
801(d)(1)(c).
the
court
of
appeals
cases
do
establish
that
as
long
as
i
am
available
for
cross
examination,
even
if
my
memory
is
not
good,
as
long
as
i
am
available
for
cross
examination,
it
would
be
our
contention
that
that
associate
could
testify
as
to
the
out
of
court
statement.
now,
there
is
some
disagreement,
to
be
sure,
among
the
courts
of
appeals
as
to
exactly
how
much
recollection
i
have
to
have
concerning
the
statement
in
order
for
the
statement
of
the
third
party
to
be
introduced,
but
i
don't--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--he
did,
but
he
testified
merely
to
corroborate
the
fact
that
the
statement
was
made.
the
testimony
of
foster
was,
as
to
the
contents
of
the
statement
was
as
complete
as
anything
the
fbi
agent--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
that
is
probably
right,
at
least
not
under
801(d)(1)(c).
probably
no--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
owens--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--owens'
memory
died
in
part
in
this
case
in
only
a
small,
admittedly
critical
but
nonetheless
narrow
part
of
the
recollection
of
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--because
there
is
so
much
more
that
can
be
done
with
foster
on
the
stand,
available
for
cross
examination,
than
if
foster
were
not
there.
you
can
probe
such
matters
as
his
bias.
suppose,
for
example...
it
wasn't
true
in
this
case,
but
suppose
he
had
been
trying
to
get
owens
for
months,
and
owens
knew
this,
and
he
passed
this
on
to
his
attorney,
that
this
was...
that
his
attorney
could
try
to
make
use
of
that
fact
to
impeach
foster's
testimony
on
the
grounds
of
bias,
something
that
would
have
been
much
harder
to
do
if
foster
were
not
present.
similarly,
the
question
of
foster's
credibility
can
be
probed,
whether
his
demeanor
suggested
that
he
was
a
careful
person
or
a
person
who
was
quite
careless,
the
inconsistency,
for
that
matter,
between
features
of
the
statement
that
he
made
and
mansfield's
testimony
about
his
statement
would
have
been
a
fruitful
line
of
cross
examination.
it
is
true,
to
be
sure,
that
none
of
these
lines
of
cross
examination
were
pursued
in
this
case,
but
that
is
only
because
foster
did
such
a
good
job
and
was
such
a
believable
witness.
this
was
somebody
who
was
not
easily
impeached,
not
because
there
was
any
impairment...
the
hospital.
foster
had
not
been
able
to
identify
his
assailant,
or
had
suggested,
asked
a
question,
was
it
leo
who
hit
me...
there
was
another
inmate
in
the
penitentiary
whose
name
was
leo,
as
established
by
defense
counsel,
and
that
was
made
the
basis
of
the
suggestion
that
in
fact
the
owens
idea
came
up
late
in
the
day
and
wasn't
the
product
of
his
observation
at
all.
so
there
was
a
lot
that
could
be
done
and
there
was
some
fair
amount
that
actually
was
done
by
virtue
of
having
foster
there,
even
though
his
memory
had,
as
you
say,
died
with
respect
to
the
question
of
identity.
but,
your
honor,
memory
dies
like
that
a
lot
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
not
just
cases
of
trauma
where
the
person's
memory
may
be
thought
to
have
died
because
he
was
hit
on
the
head,
but
in
cases
that
come
up
every
day
where
a
bank
teller,
let's
say--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--absolutely,
your
honor,
but
if
we
take
this
case,
which
does
come
up
every
day,
the
bank
teller
has
a
robber
come
in,
put
a
gun
in
his
or
her
face,
and
the
bank
teller
gives
over
the
money,
and
then
later
that
afternoon
a
suspect
is
captured.
the
bank
teller
goes
down
to
the
police
station,
and
there
is
an
id.
the
bank
teller
selects,
without
any
doubt,
selects
number
3
as
the
person
who
put
the
gun
in
her
face.
a
year
and
a
half
later,
trial
comes
on
and
the
bank
teller
cannot
make
an
identification
in
court,
just
can't
pick
the
defendant
out.
well,
that
is
exactly
the
case
for
which
801(d)(1)(c)
was
devised,
cases
where
memory
at
trial
has
in
your
words
died.
there
is
no
recollection
as
to
identification
certainly
it
is
a
critical
fact.
it
is
the
most
critical
fact
in
the
case.
nonetheless,
we
submit
that
the
rule
is
satisfied,
and
we
submit
that
because
the
bank
teller
is
available
for
cross
examination,
particularly
if
she
can
remember
making
the
statement
and
the
details
of
the
statement,
that
in
that
case
the
confrontation
clause
is
satisfied
as
well.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
rule
801
has
very
different
language,
your
honor.
they
could
have...
congress
could
have
said
that
the
witness
has
to
be
subject
to
cross
examination
about
the
statement...
subject
to
cross
examination
about
the
subject
matter
of
the
statement.
instead,
it
didn't
say
that,
and
it,
and
it
is
interesting
and
to
us
probative
that
in
fact
congress
in
sections
that
were
so
close
together
used
very
different
language.
he
clearly
was
in
this
case
by
any
fair
construction
of
the
terms
subject
to
cross
examination
about
or
concerning
the
statement.
he
remembered
the
statement.
he
was
subject
to
cross
examination.
he
was
cross
examined
about
the
statement.
the
only
thing
he
was
not
subject...
well,
he
was
subject
to
cross
examination,
but
the
only
thing
he
could
not
fruitfully
be
cross
examined
on
was
the
underlying
basis
for
the
statement,
to
wit:
the...
how
it
was
that
he
observed
owens.
that
in
our
view
does
not
make
rule
801(d)(1)(c)--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--he
could
be
asked
that,
and
he
was,
and
he
denied
it.
he
said,
i
don't
remember
now
the
defendant;
however,
what
he
did
say
was--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--he
is
the
one
in
the
picture.
he
is
the
one
i
picked
out,
he
is
the
one
i
identified,
and
of
course
another
line
of
cross
examination
could
have
been
fruitful
on
this
score,
but
wasn't
because
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
suppose
foster
had
not
known
owens
for
very
long,
owens
had
just
arrived
in
the
cell
area.
the
question
whether
he
would
recognize
owens
could
be
raised,
but
in
fact,
of
course,
because
he
knew
owens
very
well,
it
was
difficult
to
make
that
point
on
cross
examination.
again,
cross
examination
was
not
rendered
ineffective
for
constitutional
purposes
simply
because
it
didn't
work.
now,
as
i
have
indicated,
the
effectiveness
test
that
respondent
has
suggested
is
one
that
has
a
lot
of
problems.
to
try
to
make
the
confrontation
clause
turn
on
the
extent
to
which
confrontation
of
cross
examination
may
be
effective
in
a
particular
case
runs
into
what
this
court
said
in
roberts
is
an
inevitably
nebulous
threshold
of
effectiveness
respondent
has
offered
no
real
standard
for
determining
in
any
class
of
cases
when
cross
examination
is
effective
and
when
it
is
not
effective.
and
in
fact,
as
we
have
suggested,
memory
loss
may
not
render
cross
examination
less
effective.
it
may
render
it
more
effective.
it
just
depends
on
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
cases,
and
what
really
has
more
effect
on
effectiveness
than
simple
fact
memory
loss
is
what
vulnerability
the
witness
may
have
in
other
spheres
of
attack
on
its
bias,
credibility,
powers
of
observation,
and
so
forth.
to
try
to
assess
effectiveness
in
every
given
case,
to
say
that
the
constitutional
principle
of
confrontation
turns
on
whether
or
not
the
cross
examination
was
effective
in
a
particular
case
would,
we
submit,
be
chaotic
as
an
approach
to
try
to
give
the
lower
courts
and
the
state
courts
in
applying
the
confrontation
clause
any
guidance
at
all
as
to
how
the
admissibility
of
statements
should
be
judged.
that
is
a
principle
that
ought
to
be
reserved
for
the
rules
of
evidence
as
this
court,
congress,
and
the
states
work
them
out.
it
should
not
be
a
constitutionally
binding
principle
for
all
time
that
turns
on
a
court's
impression
as
to
how
effective
the
opportunity
for
cross
examination
was
on
a
particular
fact
situation.
and
i
would
point
out
finally
that
the...
to
the
extent
that
effectiveness
is
a
question,
as
i
have
suggested
in
this
case,
the
cross
examination
was
effective.
there
were
things
that
were
brought
out
about
prior
statements
foster
had
made
in
the
hospital,
and--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--we
think
so,
and
we
don't
think
that
that's...
we
think
that
the
language
of
the
rule
doesn't
require
that
the
jury
be
satisfied
to
any
degree.
all
that
the
language
of
the
rule
requires
is
that
the
declarant
be
subject
to
cross
examination
concerning
the
statement.
even
if
he
has
a
virtually
total
lack
of
recollection
as
to
the
statement,
that
is
a
fact
that
the
jury
can
assess
in
determining
his
credibility
or
determining
the
likely
reliability
of
the
statement.
we
don't
think
that
he
has
to
have
any
specific
degree
of
recollection
with
respect
to
the
contents
of
the
statement,
or
certainly
not
with
respect
to
the
basis
of
the
statement,
that
is,
why
he
reached
the
conclusion
that
he
did.
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
thank
you.
mr.
ides
pointed
out
the
line
of
questioning,
line
of
argument
that
was
followed
by
defense
counsel
in
this
case
that
was
the
most
effective
form
of
cross
examination
and
exploitation
of
that
cross
examination,
which
was
the
suggestion
that
because
there
had
been
a
number
of
visits
of
other
people
to
foster
before
foster
made
his
identification
of
owens,
perhaps
owens's
name
had
been
suggested
to
him
by
these
other
people.
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
effective
cross
examination
and
exploitation
of
cross
examination
which
was
made
possible
in
this
case
by
the
very
fact
that
foster
was
unable
to
say
that
i
identified
owens
as
my
assailant.
he
was
unable
to
remember
the
reason
for
his
identification,
and
therefore
that
opened
up
the
arena
for
this
precise
kind
of
argument
that
mr.
ides
has
pointed
out
that
was
made
at
trial,
and
it
was
made
effectively
by
counsel.
now,
there
is
a
further
question
which--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--therefore
it
may
have
come
from
somewhere
else.
that
is...
if
the
test
is
whether
the
cross
examination
has
to
be
effective,
that
opened
up
an
avenue
of
effective
cross
examination
for
the
defense.
now,
the
focus
has
also
been
put
on
this
whole
question
of
whether
there
was
actual
opportunity
to
make
the
observation,
whether
for
602
reasons
or
for
cross
examination
reasons.
i
would
like
to
point
out
just
two
factual
matters
quickly.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
pipe,
he
made
two
comments
about
the
pipe.
one
was
the
sound
of
the
pipe
that
mr.
ides
referred
to.
he
also
said
at
page
27
of
the
appendix,
thinking
back,
it
did
have
to
be
a
pipe,
that
is
about
the
right
size,
which
suggests
that
he
actually
saw
the
pipe.
second,
there
were
two
witnesses,
three,
actually,
who
testified
as
to
seeing
owens
beating
or
hovering
over
foster,
one
of
whom
was
the
person...
this
was
witness
bowers,
who
was
hovering
over
foster
after
the
beating.
there
was
another
witness,
however,
jeffery,
who
testified
that--
