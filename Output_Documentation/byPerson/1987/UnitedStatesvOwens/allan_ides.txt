mr.
allan
ides
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
immediately
address
some
of
the
points
that
were
raised
during
mr.
bryson's
argument.
first,
justice
o'connor,
on
the
question
of
personal
knowledge,
the
government
is
mistaken.
the
district
court
made
absolutely
no
finding
on
the
question
of
personal
knowledge.
the
district
court
stated
that
personal
knowledge
merely
goes
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
no
finding
was
made
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
no
finding
was
made
by
the
district
court
on
that
issue.
we
agree
completely
that
if
at
all
possible,
this
case
ought
to
be
resolved
on
the
statutory
questions,
and
in
fact
before
the
ninth
circuit
our
argument
was
based
largely
on
rule
602
and
rule
801(d)(1)(c).
as
to
the
evidence
of
personal
knowledge
that
the
government
for
the
first
time
brings
up
today--
mr.
allan
ides
--602
point?
mr.
allan
ides
the
alternate
basis
for
affirmance
we
have
relied
on
is
801(d)(1)(c),
although
we
have
mentioned
the
602
point
in
the
brief
and
discussed
it.
mr.
allan
ides
we
did
not
because
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
resolve
that
issue.
i
would
like
to
just
mention
a
couple
of
points
on
the
factual
statements
the
government
made,
the
fact
that
it
was
a
pipe,
that
he
saw
that
it
was
a
pipe
somehow
indicates
that
he
saw
what
was
going
on.
well,
the
testimony
was
that
"i
heard
something
hit
my
head
and
it
sounded
like
a
pipe."
that
doesn't
indicate
that
he
saw
anybody.
his
testimony
also
indicated
that
he
was
attacked
from
behind.
in
the
eyewitness
testimony
that
someone
saw
him
facing,
foster
facing
his
assailant,
that
is
not
what
the
testimony
was.
the
testimony
was
that
the
assailant
was
hovering
over
mr.
foster.
we
don't
know
which
direction
mr.
foster's
face
was
pointing
in.
of
course,
no
findings
have
been
made
on
these
points.
the
other
point
that
i
think
is
very
important,
mr.
justice
white,
you
mentioned
the
photograph,
and
the
photographic
spread
that
foster
recalls
having
identified
owens
in.
it
is
irrelevant,
and
it
is
irrelevant
for
this
reason.
foster
knew
owens
intimately.
they
worked
together
every
day.
when
he
identified
him
in
the
photo
spread,
he
merely
said,
yes,
that's
owens.
so
the
fact
that
he
could
say,
yes,
owens
struck
me,
and
that's
a
picture
of
this
person
who
i
have
known
for
the
past
year
or
so
doesn't
indicate
a
circumstance
where
he
has
made
an
identification
of
an
anonymous
person
and
then
in
court
says,
yes,
that's
the
person
i
identified.
it
is
merely
affirming
the
fact
that
he
knows
owens,
so
the
photographic
spread
really
adds
no
weight
to
the
government's
case
whatsoever.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
a
right
of
trial
procedure
that
goes
to
the
integrity
of
the
factfinding
process.
we
are
not
talking
about
an
exclusionary
rule.
we
are
not
talking
about
miranda.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
rule
designed
to
protect
or
to
allow
police
an
adequate
amount
of
discretion
in
the
field.
we
are
talking
about
a
very
important
rule
of
trial
procedure
that
goes
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial
and
the
ultimate
integrity
of
the
factfinding
process.
this
court
has
stated
on
numerous
occasions,
the
most
recently
kentucky
v.
stincer,
that
the
confrontation
clause
and
the
right
of
cross
examination
are
functional
rights
designed
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
factfinding
process
and
to
create
a
basis
upon
which
the
reliability
of
testimonial
evidence
can
be
assessed
by
the
trier
of
fact.
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
a
memory
loss
precludes
confrontation.
the
question
is
what
is
the
impact
on
cross
examination,
regardless
of
whether
it
is
a
memory
loss
or,
as
the
government
concedes,
an
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment
a
refusal
to
testify
on
other
grounds,
incapacity
of
the
witness,
or
some
trial
court
restriction
on
the
scope
of
cross
examination.
in
all
this
court's
cases
the
focus
is
not
on
the
particular
intrusion,
but
on
the
impact
of
that
intrusion,
and
that
is
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case.
according
to
the
government,
the
confrontation
clause
is
satisfied
essentially
by
presence
at
trial,
a
physical
presence
model,
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
there
is
neither
judicial
nor
scholarly
support
for
that
position,
with
the
possible
exception
of
justice
harland
who,
as
i
will
discuss,
if
i
can
get
to
it,
has
a
very
similar
model
for
assessing
reliability
under
the
due
process
clause.
the
government
is
really
staking
out
radically
new
grounds
for
this
court,
and
it
is
an
illogical
ground.
for
example,
the
government
tells
us
that
clearly
if
a
witness
refuses
to
testify
based
on
the
fifth
amendment,
as
in
douglas
versus
alabama,
that
would
violate
the
confrontation
clause.
clearly,
if
a
court,
as
in
davis
versus
alaska,
restricts
the
ability
to
cross
examine
a
witness
with
respect
to
impeachment,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause.
yet
what
is
the
difference
between
those
cases
and
our
case?
suppose,
for
example,
instead
of
saying
i
don't
remember,
mr.
foster
said,
i
take
the
fifth
amendment.
or
suppose
mr.
foster
said,
or
suppose
the
court
said,
i
am
not
going
to
permit
you
to
inquire
into
the
basis,
or
suppose
mr.
foster
merely
said,
i
don't
understand
these
questions,
they
are
just
too
confusing
for
me
to
answer.
in
all
of
those
cases
the
government
would
say
there
was
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause.
it
must
be
because
the
defendant's
ability
to
assess
the
reliability
of
the
testimony
and
to
provide
a
basis
for
reliability
testing
is
lacking
in
all
of
those
cases.
a
memory
loss
has
the
same
effect.
if,
as
in
this
case,
and
it
is
a
narrow
case,
it
is
a
small
case,
if
there
is
a
total
memory
loss,
and
in
this
case
a
medically
certifiable
memory
loss.
we
are
not
talking
about
circumstances
which
it
is
a
partial
memory
loss
or
which
the
witness
can't
remember
a
few
cursory
details.
we
are
talking
about
a
case
in--
mr.
allan
ides
--i
disagree
respectfully,
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
this
opinion
can
be
written
very
narrowly,
and
i
think
this
court
has
created
a
basis
for
a
very
narrow
opinion
here.
in
a
number
of
cases
the
court
has
said,
in
only
the
most
extraordinary
case
where
there
has
been
questioning
of
the
witness
will
we
inquire
into
effectiveness,
and
by
the
way,
effectiveness
is
not
our
standard.
it
is
a
standard
derived
from
this
court's
cases,
beginning
with
california
versus
green,
so
there
must
be
some
substance
to
it,
and
i
think
this
court
can
establish
that
this
is
an
extraordinary
case
by
first
indicating
its
close
relationship
to
cases
such
as
douglas
versus
alabama
and
davis
versus
alaska.
you
appear
to
want
to
ask
a
question.
mr.
allan
ides
the
bank
teller--
mr.
allan
ides
--it
would
depend
again
on
the
circumstances
of
the
bank
teller
example.
if
the
bank
teller
could
not
remember...
if
there
were
no
facts,
including
a
lack
of
memory
indicating
that
the
bank
teller
even
looked
at
the
robber
in
the
face,
then
there
would
be
substantial
problems
in
that
case.
the
typical
case
of
the
bank
teller,
though,
is
the
circumstance
where,
when
it
comes
three
years
later
and
you
come
to
trial,
the
bank
teller
can
say,
i
was
working
at
the
bank,
a
person
walked
up
to
me,
put
a
gun
in
my
face.
i
looked
at
that
person,
they
told
me
to
turn
over
the
money,
i
turned
over
the
money,
on
that
day
the
bank
was
well
lit,
it
took
about
35
or
40
seconds,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
can't
remember
exactly
what
the
person
looked
like
today,
though
one
week
after
that
i
did
identify
that
person
in
a
photograph
spread,
that
is
very
different.
we
now
have
an
opportunity
to
cross
examine
that
bank
teller
as
to
the
basis
for
the
identification.
he
or
she
may
not
remember
now
who
the
exact
person
was,
but
they
are
available
to
be
tested
as
to
the
basis
for
making
that
identification,
and
that
is
the
key
to
identification
evidence.
and
the
government
has
pointed
out,
and
justice
brennan
has
pointed
out,
it
was
the
critical
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
ides
no,
i
don't
think
it
would,
and
the
reason
it
wouldn't
is
because
we
have
now
established
a
basis
for
the
trier
of
fact
to
sit
down
and
look
at
what
the
teller
actually
saw.
mr.
allan
ides
she
has
to
remember
at
least
this,
that
she
saw
the
person
and
had
an
opportunity
to
observe
the
person.
that
is
critical,
and
i
think
louisell
and
mueller
point
out
in
their
text
that
in
801(d)(1)(c)
as
with
the
confrontation
clause
there
is
a
critical
relationship
between
personal
knowledge
and
the
identification.
mr.
allan
ides
but
she
did
say
that
i
remember
that
i
saw
him,
and
foster
in
this
case
could
not
remember
whether
he
had
ever
seen
his
assailant.
he
never
testified
that
i
saw
him
but
i
now
can't
remember
what
he
looked
like.
what
he
testified
to
was,
i
don't
remember
if
i
ever
saw
him.
mr.
allan
ides
well,
again,
that
is
going
to
depend
on
a
case
by
case
analysis.
there
is
no
question
about
this.
but
it
seems
to
me
what
we
are
going
to
have
to
look
at
is
first,
is
the
loss
of
memory
directed
toward
a
critical
part
of
the
case;
second,
is
the
loss
of
memory
such
that
you
cannot
assess
the
credibility
of
the
person
based
on
that
loss
of
memory;
and
third,
is
the
loss
of
memory
complete?
and
in
this
case,
as
to
the
only
critical
evidence
that
foster
could
give,
it
was
complete.
there
was
no
way
to
cross
examine
him
on
that
point.
no
way
to
establish
his
personal
knowledge
or
lack
of
personal
knowledge.
no
way
to
establish
his
opportunity
to
observe.
mr.
allan
ides
yes.
mr.
allan
ides
i
do
think
it
would
violate
the
confrontation
clause
for
exactly
the
same
reasons.
mr.
allan
ides
under
those
circumstances
it
seems
to
me
they
would
unless
you
could
establish
that
there
were
independent
indicia
of
reliability,
and
it
may
be,
in
fact,
this
court
has
held
that
a
dying
declaration
is
firmly
rooted
in
our
jurisprudence,
and
therefore
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
reliable.
this
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
is
not
firmly
routed.
mr.
allan
ides
that
is
true.
mr.
allan
ides
well,
i
think
the
first
argument
in
that
case
would
be
personal
knowledge,
and
again
we
come
back
to
that
because
it
is
really...
it
is
the
essence
of
this
evidence.
we
come
back
to
that
because
it
is
really
the
essence
of
this
evidence,
if
foster
doesn't
have
personal
knowledge
of
who
his
assailant
was,
then
the
evidence
shouldn't
be
admissible,
and
we
have
that
problem
in
that
same
circumstance.
because
of
the
nature
of
what
foster
told
mansfield,
he
didn't
tell
mansfield
the
details
of
the
crime.
the
question
was,
who
did
it,
owens
did
it.
i
jammed
my
finger
into
the
chest
of
the
person
who
assaulted
me.
period.
that's
all
we
got.
so
it
seems
to
me
it
would
present
the
same
problems
of
confrontation.
let's
assume,
in
fact,
foster
never
testified.
i
think
that
is...
it
may
not
have
been
a
dying
declaration,
but
then
he
may
have
died
six
months
later
or
a
year
later.
assume
he
hadn't
testified,
and
the
only
evidence
we
had
was
mansfield
on
the
stand
saying
he
made
that
statement
to
me.
there
is
no
way
that
that
would
satisfy
the
confrontation
clause
under
this
court's
rulings,
and
in
essence
the
defendant
is
in
no
better
position
having
foster
take
the
stand.
in
fact,
he
is
in
a
worse
position
because
he
has
a
man
take
the
stand
and
say,
one
day
i
vividly
remember
identifying
this
person,
and
it
seems
that
even
the
government
would
agree
if
only
mansfield
was
testifying
as
to
this
evidence
it
would
violate
the
confrontation
clause.
the
cases
are
on
the
same
footing.
mr.
allan
ides
yes.
i
don't
know
if
that
would...
that
indicates
to
me
that
he
knew
owens.
he
knew
him
personally.
and
there
is
also
another
grounds
indicated
in
the
record
for
his
identification.
mr.
allan
ides
well,
he
did
it
in
reverse
order.
he
said,
owens,
who
i
personally
know,
assaulted
me,
and
here's
his
picture.
mr.
allan
ides
and
i
think
that...
again,
a
photo
spread
doesn't
add
anything.
mr.
allan
ides
yes.
mr.
allan
ides
exactly,
and
one
of
the
answers
that
was
suggested,
and
again
he
had
no
memory
of
this,
and
he
couldn't
remember
anyone
who
visited
him
prior
to
the
fbi
agent
nor
could
he
remember
anyone
who
visited
him
after
the
fbi
agent,
yet
the
evidence
was
that
he
was
visited
by
prison
personnel
and
by
his
wife
every
day.
he
couldn't
remember
those
visits,
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
one
of
them
said,
owens
is
under
investigation.
he
is
the
guy
who
hit
you.
mr.
allan
ides
absolutely
none.
mr.
allan
ides
he
wasn't
asked.
mr.
allan
ides
or
i
may
be
guessing.
mr.
allan
ides
when
i
say
he
wasn't
asked
at
the
time
he
was
interviewed
by
the
fbi
agent,
he
was
not
asked.
during
cross
examination--
mr.
allan
ides
--it
wasn't
necessary.
it
again
is--
mr.
allan
ides
--well,
i
emphasize
it
only
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question.
the
point
is,
he
was
asked
on
cross
examination,
do
you
remember
anything
about
the
person
who
struck
you?
mr.
allan
ides
the
fact
that
he
just
wrote
it
down
is
just
merely
another
out
of
court
identification.
again,
the
crucial
evidence
in
this
case
is,
i
saw
the
person
who
struck
me,
and
that
is
what
we
want
to
explore
in
this
case.
it
is
locked
in
a
little
box
which
you
never
know.
mr.
allan
ides
we
can
only
explore
it
if
foster
has
some
independent
recollection
of
having
seen
his
assailant
or
if
the--
mr.
allan
ides
--asked--
mr.
allan
ides
--he
was
asked
whether
he
recalled
at
the
time
of
trial
seeing
his
assailant.
his
answer
was,
no,
i
can't
remember.
mr.
allan
ides
well,
the
problem
with
that...
i
think
the
best
way
to
answer
that
is
contrasting
this
case
with
the
fensterer
case.
in
the
fensterer
case,
this
court
was
confronted
with
a
situation
in
which
an
expert
couldn't
remember
the
basis
for
which
three
hairs
had
been
forcibly
pulled...
his
conclusion
that
three
hairs
had
been
forcibly
pulled
from
the
victim's
head.
and
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause,
but
i
think
as
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
pennsylvania
versus
ritche,
the
essence
of
fensterer
was
that
in
failing
to
remember
the
expert
undermined
his
credibility,
and
that
was
the
key
to
the
fensterer
case,
the
credibility
assessment
could
be
made.
mr.
allan
ides
but
he
didn't.
it
seems
to
me
this
case
is
different
from
fensterer,
and
the
reason
it
is
different
from
fensterer
is
because,
and
again,
this
goes
to
justice
rehnquist's
point
about
a
narrow
decision,
the
memory
loss
in
this
case
is
independent
of
credibility,
completely
independent
of
credibility,
just
as
the
fifth
amendment
assertion--
mr.
allan
ides
--no,
it
is
easier
to
admit
that
because
the
basis
for
judging
credibility
has
been
established.
it
isn't...
the
purpose
of
the
confrontation--
mr.
allan
ides
--no,
i
respectfully
disagree.
we
have
a
very
different
situation
here.
in
fensterer,
the
lack
of
memory
went
to
the
expert's
ability
as
an
expert.
in
this
case
the
lack
of
memory--
mr.
allan
ides
--but
it
has
no
bearing
on--
mr.
allan
ides
--but
in
the
one,
fensterer,
a
basis
is
created
through
the
questioning
and
through
the
admission
of
a
lack
of
memory
for
the
trier
of
fact
to
assess
whether
this
is
a
credible
witness.
in
our
case,
you
don't
have
that.
it
is
the
same
as
if
it
had
been
a
fifth
amendment
assertion.
if
a
declarant
says,
i'm
not
going
to
testify
based
on
the
fifth
amendment,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
credibility
of
an
out
of
court
confession
that
perhaps
is
being
introduced.
similarly
in
this
case
the
fact
that
the
man
has
suffered
a
memory
loss
has
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
whether
he
ever
observed
his
assailant.
that
is
the
credibility
question
in
this
case.
the
credibility
question
in
fensterer
is,
is
this
expert
truly
an
expert
if
he
cannot
recall
the
basis
for
his
testimony?
mr.
allan
ides
and
in
fensterer
the
trier
of
fact
was
given
an
opportunity
to--
mr.
allan
ides
--but
you
can't
say
that
about
a
man
who
has
suffered
a
memory
loss.
you
can't
say--
mr.
allan
ides
--i
think
we
have
to
look
at
it...
from
the
point
of
view
of
lawyers
and
judges
and
justices,
yes,
we
can
look
at
that
in
a
very
sophisticated
way,
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
jurors
i
don't
think
it
is
looked
at
in
that
way.
the
jurors
see
a
very
sympathetic
witness
get
on
the
stand
and
say
one
day
it
was
vivid,
i
vividly
remember
saying
that
this
man
did
it
to
me,
you
know,
i
was
injured,
and
maybe
even
by
this
man,
this
may
be
the
man
who
did
it,
and
now
i
can't
remember
whether
i
actually
saw
him
do
it.
i
think
that
kind
of
weight
the
jury
is
going
to
put
on
that
under
circumstances
where--
mr.
allan
ides
--but
it
seems
to
me
the
courts
have
a
threshold
responsibility
to
determine
whether
evidence
has
been
subjected
to
effective
cross
examination,
and
i
agree
with
justice
blackmun
that
in
the
typical
case,
a
simple
case,
simple
questioning
will
resolve
that
question,
but
in
some
cases,
unless
the
confrontation
clause
is
just
a
formality
once
you
put
the
witness
on
the
stand,
in
some
cases
we
have
to
inquire
whether
there
was
any
possibility
of
establishing
a
basis
under
which
the
trier
of
fact
could
assess
credibility.
mr.
allan
ides
yes.
mr.
allan
ides
the
case
would
be
different,
and
i
think
it
would
be
analyzed
differently.
mr.
allan
ides
all
right,
it
would
be
analyzed
differently.
first,
there's
two
parts
to
the
confrontation
clause.
one
is
entitlement
to
confrontation,
to
cross
examination,
and
i
think
in
both
cases,
the
hypothetical
you
have
just
described
and
in
this
case,
there
was
not
an
opportunity
for
effective
cross
examination.
then
we
go
to
the
next
step.
despite
this
lack
of
an
opportunity
for
effective
cross
examination,
are
there
indicia
of
reliability
that
indicate
that
this
evidence
ought
to
be
admitted
anyway?
in
your
hypothetical,
there
may
be
indicia
of
reliability
that
would
permit
it.
in
this
case
there
aren't,
and
the
government
doesn't
agree
with
that.
the
government
has
never
challenged
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling
that
this
was
unreliable
under
the
factors
articulated
in
dutton
versus
evans
and
ohio
versus
roberts.
so
i
think
the
hypotheticals
are
different
although
they
would
be
analyzed
under
the
same
structure.
mr.
allan
ides
no,
i
don't
believe
it
could
be
cured
by
instruction.
mr.
allan
ides
because,
again,
it
is
the
type
of
evidence
that
the
court
must
make
an
initial
assessment
whether
this
evidence
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
jury
can
now
at
this
point
assess
for
its
reliability.
that
is
a
threshold
question
for
the
court.
mr.
allan
ides
it
should
have
been
excluded.
mr.
allan
ides
could
not
cross
examine
on
it.
mr.
allan
ides
well,
if
it
were
excluded
we
probably
wouldn't
be
here
today.
if
it
were
excluded,
it
was
the
crucial
element
in
the
government's
case.
the
government
admits
that.
this
critical
evidence,
owens
was
my
assailant,
and
then
we
have
this
black
box,
why,
and
the
box
is
locked,
and
it
is
just
as
effectively
locked
with
a
memory
loss
as
it
is
with
the
fifth
amendment
or
as
it
is
with
a
trial
court
ruling
that
you
can't
ask
that
question.
mr.
allan
ides
the
only
point.
mr.
allan
ides
the
box.
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
am
using
an
analogy.
i
am
essentially
saying
the
information
that
is
crucial
to
this
case,
namely,
the
basis
for
the
identification,
is
not
accessible
to
the
trier
of
fact
in
the
same
way
that
it
wouldn't
be
accessible
if
foster
had
taken
the
fifth
amendment
or
if
the
trial
court
had
said
you
can't
ask
questions
on
those
grounds.
mr.
allan
ides
it
may
be
enough.
i
think
i
would
want
more
facts.
i
am
certain
that
in
your
bank
teller--
mr.
allan
ides
--well,
ohio
versus
roberts
said
that
it
is
a
case
by
case
analysis.
i
believe
that
if
we
are
going
to
look
into
the
indicia
of
reliability
component
of
the
case
it
is
a
case
by
case
analysis.
that
is
the
rule
articulated
by
this
court.
mr.
allan
ides
i
have
two
responses
to
that,
and
i
will
go
backwards.
one
is,
we
can
avoid
making
this
a
rule
for
thousands
and
thousands
of
state
court
judges
by
focusing
on
801(d)(1)(c)
and
concluding
that
this
evidence
should
not
have
been
admitted
under
that
rule.
mr.
allan
ides
so
we
have
narrowed
it
down
to
600
federal
judges,
and
i
think
federal
judges
are
competent
to
assess
this
kind
of
a
question.
again,
the
court
opinion,
it
seemed
to
me,
would
say
this
is
the
extraordinary
case
we
referred
to
in
ohio
versus
roberts.
it
is
california-green
revisited
in
a
sense,
and
i
read
california
versus
green
a
little
differently
than
the
government.
it
seems
to
me
the
question
wasn't
reserved
in
california
versus
green.
the
court
said
there
was
a
constitutional
issue
lurking
in
this
case,
but
the
facts
in
this
record
aren't
sufficient
for
us
to
answer
it.
the
facts
in
this
record
are
sufficient.
it
was
remanded
to
the
california
supreme
court
and
they
concluded
that
the
evidence
in
california
versus
green
was
reliable.
mr.
allan
ides
again,
i
would...
that
is
very
similar
to
justice
white's
hypothetical.
i
think
then
we
would
have
to
assess
it
under
the
second
component
of
confrontation
clause
analysis,
whether
there
are
sufficient
indicia
of
reliability
of
this
out
of
court
statement,
and
i
think
we
would
have
to
look
at
that,
but
the
same
conclusion
would
be
arrived
at
with
respect
to
was
there
effective
cross
examination,
and
the
answer,
it
seems
to
me,
has
to
be
no.
mr.
allan
ides
no.
again,
the
two
components
of
the
confrontation
clause
are,
was
there
an
opportunity
for
effective
cross
examination...
that
is
the
douglas,
davis
line
of
cases...
and
then
the
second
line
is,
assuming
there
was
no
opportunity
for
effective
cross
examination,
is
the
evidence
still
admissible
because
independently
we
say
that
it
is
reliable
as
judges,
and
i
am
saying
under
the
hypothetical
you
have
suggested
we
would
get
to
the
question
of
whether
it
is
reliable
despite
the
lack
of
cross
examination,
are
there
adequate
indicia
of
reliability,
and
in
this
case
the
ninth
circuit
said
there
weren't.
mr.
allan
ides
well,
again,
there's
two
parts
to
the
confrontation
clause.
the
first
part
is
whether
the
defendant
had
an
opportunity
for
effective
cross
examination.
that
is
the
part
that
we
have
been
talking
about
mostly
now,
whether
the
memory
loss
undermined
that
ability.
mr.
allan
ides
no,
i
absolutely
don't
say
that
at
all.
i
think
there
are
circumstances
when
the
memory
loss
may
bear
on
credibility.
when
memory
loss
is
independent
of
the
question
of
the
credibility,
the
underlying
credibility
of
the
statement,
then
i
think
we
have
this
question
of
whether
the
memory
loss,
if
it
is
both
critical
and
complete
and
independent
of
credibility,
actually
does
undermine
cross
examination.
then
we
get
to
the
second
question.
the
evidence
still
may
be
admissible
if
it
is
otherwise
reliable,
either
because
it
is
based
on
a
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exception
or
because
in
this
particular
case
based
on
your
facts
there
are
sufficient
indicia
of
reliability,
and
that
is
ohio
versus
roberts.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court...
this
case
is
a
very
straightforward
application
of
that,
and
we
have
focused
largely
on
whether
there
was
an
opportunity
to
effectively
cross
examine.
i
think
from
a
practical
lawyer's
point
of
view,
whether
you
are
talking
about
a
prosecutor
or
a
defense
attorney,
if
you
took
this
case
aside,
they
would
say,
you
know,
i
really
couldn't
effectively
cross
examine
someone
who
had
so
complete
a
memory
loss
as
to
the
most
critical
evidence
in
the
case,
and
the
confrontation
clause
is
supposed
to
be
a
practical
rule
for
advancing
the
integrity
of
the
trial
process,
and
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
it
like
that.
i
would
like
to
finally
answer
the
second
part
of
my
answer
to
your
question,
justice
rehnquist,
on
a
narrow
construction
to
this
ruling,
and
it
is
a
narrow
one.
first,
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that
there
is
a
certain
illogic
between
saying
a
memory
loss
will
not
constitute
a
confrontation
clause
violation,
whereas
an
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment
would,
even
though
the
same
evidence
is
being
excluded
from
the
trier
of
fact,
the
same
opportunity
to
cross
examine
is
being
eliminated
in
both
cases.
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that.
so
then
it
seems
to
me
the
court's
ruling
should
be
modeled
on
cases
such
as
douglas
versus
alabama,
davis
versus
alaska,
smith
versus
illinois,
in
which
the
court
found
that
some
trial
court
imposed
restriction
undermined
defendant's
ability
to
cross
examine.
so,
first
we
would
have
to
make
that
finding.
second,
i
think
we
have
to
talk
about
the
fact
that
it
is
a
critical
part
of
evidence,
as
this
court
recognized
as
important
in
dutton
versus
evans.
and
third,
the
fact
that
in
this
case
we
have
a
complete
memory
loss,
a
complete
memory
loss,
and
it's
medically
certifiable,
and
just
like
the
fifth
amendment,
it
is
independent
from
the
underlying
credibility
of
the
statement,
i
saw
owens
do
it.
the
fact
that
he
has
a
memory
loss
doesn't
undermine
in
any
way
that
he
may
well
have
seen
owens
do
it.
it
doesn't
add
anything
to
it.
it
remains
untouchable.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
