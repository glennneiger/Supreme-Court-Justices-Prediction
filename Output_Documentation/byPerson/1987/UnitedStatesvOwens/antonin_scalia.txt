justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent,
james
owens,
an
inmate
at
a
federal
prison,
was
convicted
of
assualt
with
intent
to
commit
murder
in
the
beating
of
a
prison
guard.
the
beating
left
the
guard
with
a
severely
impared
memory.
at
owen's
trial
the
guard
testified
that
he
clearly
remembered
that
while
hospitalized
following
the
attack
he
identifead
owens
as
his
assailant
to
an
fbi
agent.
on
cross-examination
he
admitted
that
he
could
not
remember
seeing
his
assailant
and
could
not
remember
any
other
persons
who
visited
him
at
the
hospital.
on
appeal
a
divided
panel
of
ninth
circuit
reverse
the
conviction
finding
violations
of
both
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and
rule
802
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
the
majority
viewed
the
prison
guard's
memory
loss
as
undermining
the
defendent's
right
to
cross
examine
protected
by
the
constitution
and
by
federal
rule
802.
we
reverse.
as
we
have
repeatedly
held,
the
confrontation
clause
guarantees
only
an
opportunity
for
effective
cross-examination
not
cross-examination
that
is
effective
in
whatever
way
and
to
whatever
extent
the
defendent
might
wish.
such
an
opportunity
is
not
denied
when
a
witness
testifies
as
to
his
present
or
past
belief
or
is
unable
to
remember
the
reason
for
that
belief.
since
the
defense
may
still
bring
out
facts
tending
to
impune
the
testimony
such
as
witness'
bias,
poor
eyesight,
lack
of
attentiveness,
and
even
the
very
fact
that
the
witness'
memory
is
not
reliable.
the
constitional
requirement
is
satisfied
in
these
circumstances
by
the
protections
of
the
oath
cross-examination
and
opportunity
for
the
jury
to
observe
the
witness'
dimeanor.
as
for
the
federal
rules,
rule
802
which
generally
excludes
hearsay
contains
an
exeption
for
statement
of
identification
if
the
declarant
testifies
and
is
subject
to
cross-examination
concerning
the
statement
in
question.
since
this
exeption
was
adopted
for
the
very
purpose
of
reducing
barriers
to
admission
of
identification
testimony
caused
by
memory
loss,
we
are
satisfied
that
the
witness
was
subject
to
cross-examination
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule
in
this
case.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
joins.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
either
the
consideration
or
the
decision
of
this
case.
