justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
afternoon
in
no.
86-836,
hazelwood
school
district
v.
cathy
kuhlmeier.
mr.
baine,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
baine,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
eighth
circuit
saw
this
case
as
kind
of
an
estoppel
case
where
the
school
board
had
in
effect
told
the
students
you
are
going
to
have
complete
first
amendment
rights,
or
do
you
think
that
they
saw
it
as
a
case
that
it
did
not
make
any
difference
what
the
school
board
said,
that
once
you
some
students
over
loose
on
a
newspaper
that
they
have
got
those
first
amendment
rights
whether
the
school
board
wants
to
have
it
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
lost
all
of
its
power.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
baine,
supposing
in
this
particular
journalism
class
the
faculty
and
the
school
board
said
we
are
going
to
let
you
put
out
a
student
newspaper
and
it
is
a
little
bit
devoted
to
journalism,
but
one
thing
that
we
want
you
to
understand
above
everything
else
is
that
the
faculty
advisor
has
the
absolute
authority
to
censor
anything
if
he
is
a
man
or
she
if
she
is
a
woman
wants
to,
it
may
be
arbitrary
but
if
you
come
into
the
class
that
is
what
you
are
going
to
come
up
with.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
would
violate
the
first
amendment
if
the
faculty
advisor
goes
ahead
and
says
look,
i
just
do
not
think
much
of
this
article,
it
does
not
suit
me?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
answer
the
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
really
kind
of
a
fine
point
of
language.
because
i
suppose
that
the
final
editor
might
be
viewed
as
a
censor,
too,
if
that
person
does
not
agree
with
what
the
people
beneath
him
have
done
and
changes
it.
you
know,
some
people
might
call
it
editing
and
other
people
might
call
it
censorship.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
saying
here
that
the
teacher
was
part
of
the
process.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
baine.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
edwards.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
local
control,
ms.
edwards,
does
that
mean
student
control?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
does
that
help
you
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
than
if
what
were
otherwise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
in
your
view,
does
this
case
depend
on
some
sort
of
representations
that
were
made
to
the
students
putting
out
a
newspaper
by
either
the
faculty
or
the
school
board,
or
would
it
be
totally
the
same
no
matter
what
the
faculty
or
school
board
had
tried
to
establish
in
the
way
of
a
system?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
they
set
them
a
little
bit
differently,
and
said
that
this
is
going
to
be
printed
the
way
that
ordinary
newspapers
are,
it
does
not
come
out
during
class,
you
are
going
to
work
on
it
as
an
extracurricular
activity,
but
here
are
the
rules.
you
are
going
to
be
subject
to
review
on
your
subject
of
topics,
and
to
take
justice
scalia's
example,
we
want
to
promote
morality
as
we
see
it.
so
if
you
are
touching
subjects
such
as
high
school
sex,
we
will
encourage
and
insist
on
one
point
of
view
rather
than
another.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
there
is
an
instructor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
does
that
distinction
contribute
to
the
first
amendment
argument,
the
difference
between
the
curricular
and
extracurricular?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
it
said
the
students
are
to
write
these
pieces
and
we
are
not
going
to
write
anything
ourselves,
but
the
faculty
advisor
reserves
the
right
to
say
no
to
anything
that
involves
taking
a
position
that
is
morally
undesirable
for
high
school
students.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
advisor
cannot
say
i
reject
this
article
which
encourages
what
i
think
is
immorality
in
the
part
of
high
school
students,
but
i
will
accept
this
article
which
i
think
encourages
morality?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
puzzled
by
the
fact
that
the
first
amendment
implication
seems
to
turn
on
how
far
up
in
the
educational
hierarchy
that
the
decision
is
made.
what
if
you
had
a
small
rural
school
where
you
do
not
have
a
whole
of
people
and
you
do
not
have
a
whole
any
journalism
advisor,
and
the
principal
says
i
will
fill
in
as
journalism
advisor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
must
say
that
i
did
not
get
that
impression
of
your
case
from
the
answers
that
you
have
given
to
the
questions.
i
got
the
impression
that
you
thought
that
it
was
very
important
who
made
the
decisions,
whether
it
was
the
faculty
advisor
or
the
principal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
edwards.
mr.
baine,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
baine.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-836,
hazelwood
school
district
versus
kuhlmeier
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
