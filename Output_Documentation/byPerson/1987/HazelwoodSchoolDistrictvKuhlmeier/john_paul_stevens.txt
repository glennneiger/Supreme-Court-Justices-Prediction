mr.
baine,
may
i
just
interrupt.
i
just
wanted
to
ask
you
if
you
really
meant
what
you
said
in
answer
to
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question.
you
said
that
the
teacher
could
have
just
total
power
or
censorship.
that
would
mean
that
he
could
exclude
all
political
articles
that
favored
the
republicans
and
print
only
those
that
favored
the
democrats.
i
do
not
think
that
you
mean
that,
do
you
or
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
forget
the
label,
could
they
do
that,
could
you
give
the
authority
to
the
teacher?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
it
is
not
the
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is
your
answer
to
it?
i
mean
you
gave
one
answer
to
the
chief
justice,
and
i
wonder
if
that
is
the
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
the
school
could
not
give
total
power
to
the
teacher
to
exclude
anything
that
he
wanted
to?
you
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
does
not
help
us
much.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question
about
this
case.
as
i
understand
it,
part
of
the
problem
arose
because
the
person
who
normally
exercised
responsibility,
mr.
stergos
left,
and
there
was
kind
of
confusion
about
it.
supposing
that
he
had
not
left
and
everybody
was
used
to
working
with
him
and
recognized
that
he
was
the
teacher
who
controlled
it,
and
he
took
plenty
of
time
to
reach
the
same
decision
that
the
principal
reached
here,
told
the
students
all
about
it,
and
had
just
as
weak
reasons
as
the
principal
did,
but
he
came
to
that
conclusion
that
this
is
not
a
very
good
article
for
the
paper
and
you
cannot
print
it.
would
you
still
have
a
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
ended
up
after
all
of
the
deliberations
had
gone
into
whether
these
articles
ought
to
go
in
or
not,
and
he
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
these
are
not
very
good
articles
for
this
school,
i
think
that
i
will
cut
them.
do
you
have
the
same
right
to
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
say
that
is
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
you
are
really
complaining
about
is
the
fact
that
this
principal
did
not
use
very
good
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
he
decided
journalistic
standards,
this
article
does
not
show
the
degree
of
maturity
that
we
think
that
it
ought
to
show
to
have
the
school
name
on
it
and
all
of
the
rest,
there
is
some
misspelling
in
it
and
some
bad
grammar,
a
mixture
of
reasons,
that
is
not
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
advisor
can
do
it,
i
do
not
understand
why
the
principal
cannot.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
what
you
are
saying
is
if
you
are
going
to
have
censors
that
they
have
to
be
good
censors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
given
your
different
examples,
is
it
of
any
significance
in
this
case
that
the
school
had
no
objection
to
the
distribution
of
xerox
copies
of
the
material
that
was
excluded
from
the
newspaper
itself,
they
just
did
not
want
to
associate
the
school
officially
with
the
material?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
did
it
not,
i
misunderstood.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
certainly
do
not
question
your
representation.
but
when
we
have
got
a
finding
of
fact
on
something,
i
tend
to
treat
that
as
part
of
the
record,
unless
somebody
demonstrates
to
me
that
it
is
clearly
erroneous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
you
are
saying
that
your
students
had
a
first
amendment
right
to
have
a
teacher
as
good
as
mr.
stergos.
