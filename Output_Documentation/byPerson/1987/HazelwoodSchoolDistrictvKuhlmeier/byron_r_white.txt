justice
byron
r.
white
no
court
ever
decided
that
question
you
just
posed,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
they
said
that
it
was
not
part
of
the
curriculum.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
question
was
whether
a
journalism
as
part
of
a
curriculum
is
a
public
forum.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
just
the
issue
of
whether
something
is
part
of
the
curriculum
or
not
is
really
a
question
for
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
eighth
circuit
would
have
held
that
yes,
this
is
a
part
of
the
curriculum
but
it
is
still
a
public
forum.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
not
a
part
of
the
curriculum.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
obviously
was
by
the
teacher,
the
journalism
class
teacher,
or
it
would
not
have
been
in
the
paper,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
take
it
on
your
theory
that
the
school
could
not
even
require
that
the
students
include
in
the
newspaper
the
idea
that
smoking
pot
is
bad.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
first
amendment
law,
that
is
not
first
amendment
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
are
going
to
have
a
story
that
says
smoking
pot
is
great,
you
have
to
have
a
story
that
says
smoking
pot
it
bad.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
but
the
school
says
to
the
paper
you
have
put
in
a
story
that
smoking
pot
is
great,
now
you
have
to
put
in
a
story
along
with
it
that
smoking
pot
is
bad.
now
could
they
do
that
to
the
newspaper?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
so
the
students
could
exclusively
say
only
that
smoking
pot
is
great,
that
is
your
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
your
position
is
the
school
could
not
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
advisor
could
not
say
look,
if
you
are
going
to
say
smoking
pot
is
good,
in
fairness
have
a
story
that
gives
the
other
side,
you
would
say
that
the
school
advisor
could
not
do
that.
that
is
what
you
just
said
a
minute
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
that
you
would
say
that
the
principal
not
being
acquainted
with
journalism
could
not
order
this
piece
deleted
even
it
had
inflammatory
matters
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
here
is
this
principal
who
is
not
the
advisor,
and
he
is
telling
them
to
take
it
out.
justice
white
but
he
could
not
say
well,
i
think
this
article
ought
to
be
taken
out
because
it
involves
some
parents
who
really
ought
to
have
a
chance
to
say
their
piece
before
anything
is
published
like
that,
he
could
not
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
can
the
principal
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
it
was
in
oral
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
you
were
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
said
that
it
was
something
more,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
from
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
the
judgment
of
that
court
entered
in
this
case
is
reversed
for
the
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
have
joined
that
opinion.
