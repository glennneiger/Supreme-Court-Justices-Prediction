mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
come
before
the
court
to
resolve
the
issue
of
whether
a
school
sponsored
high
school
newspaper
produced
and
published
by
a
journalism
class
as
a
part
of
the
school
adopted
curriculum
under
a
teacher's
supervision
and
subject
to
a
principal's
review
is
a
public
forum
for
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment.
during
the
1982-1983
school
year,
the
hazelwood
east
curriculum
included
two
journalism
classes,
journalism
i
and
journalism
ii.
enrollment
in
journalism
ii
required
the
successful
completion
of--
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
--i
believe
the
eighth
circuit,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
they
said
that
it
was
not
part
of
the
curriculum.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
the
trial
court
found
that
it
was
found
that
it
was
a
part
of
the
curriculum
and
was
not
a
public
forum.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
the
eighth
circuit
then
found
that
because
of
the
numerous
ideas
expounded
in
the
paper
that
it
was
not
a
part
of
the
curriculum.
and
i
think
that
is
really
the
issue
that
is
here
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
school
having
adopted
a
curriculum
matter
in
the
teaching
of
journalism
through
a
textbook
and
through
a
classroom
setting
where
the
teacher
according
to
the
written
curriculum
attended
both
the
original
teaching
involving
the
textbook
course
which
was
journalism
i
and
then
in
journalism
ii
continued
with
that
same
class--
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
--i
think,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
the
matter
is
a
public
forum
is
a
matter
for
you,
because
this
then--
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
--the
eighth
circuit
found--
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
--there
was
a
finding
of
fact
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court,
and
the
eighth
circuit
never
really
did
find
that
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
were
clearly
erroneous.
what
they
did
find
was
because
of
the
diverse
opinions
that
were
allowed
to
be
present
in
there
that
the
newspaper
was
in
fact
a
public
forum.
i
do
not
think
that
they
really
reversed
any
of
the
findings
of
fact.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice,
it
was
not
that.
on
two
occasions,
there
were
printed
in
the
paper
statements
not
authorized
by
the
board
or
anybody
who
developed
in
the
evidence.
but
there
did
appear
on
two
occasions
that
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
students
would
not
be
abridged.
that
there
were
articles
appearing,
one
was
in
1980
and
one
was
in
1982.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
that
appeared
in
the
paper
itself.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
in
the
paper
itself.
but
there
was
no
developed
evidence
before
the
trial
court
how
that
all
came
about,
and
no
one
was
able
to
find
out
how
that
ever
got
in
the
paper,
but
it
certainly
was
not
adopted
by
the
board
of
education.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
right.
and
again
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
journalism
course
is
taught
by
the
teacher
in
accordance
with
the
adopted
curriculum.
and
the
curriculum
stated
specifically
how
it
would
be
adopted,
and
how
the
story
ideas,
and
how
the
course
would
be
developed.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
it
did.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
it
did
that.
there
was
a
provision
in
the
hazelwood
policies
that
matters
could
be
submitted
to
the
school
newspaper
by
persons
outside
such
as
letters
to
the
editor,
which
could
be
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
developed.
in
this
case,
there
was
in
the
newspaper
in
question
a
letter
to
the
editor
which
was
edited
by
the
teacher
of
the
class
and
put
in
there.
but
it
was
something
that
was
infrequently
used.
basically
speaking,
the
hazelwood
east
spectrum
was
a
newspaper
that
was
produced
as
a
result
of
students
successfully
completing
a
journalism
course
called
journalism
i.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
sure.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
the
concern
that
i
saw
in
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion
which
was
not
supported
by
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
in
this
case
was
the
many
and
diverse
articles
that
appeared
in
the
paper
that
the
eighth
circuit
seemed
to
find
in
the
record
were
student
initiated
or
student
sponsored.
and
therefore,
having
opened
the
hazelwood
east
spectrum
to
articles
of
diverse
opinion,
the
board
of
education
and
the
principal
would
then
have
been
estopped--
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
--lost
control
over
the
paper.
and
we
submit
that
the
record
that
we
developed
in
the
trial
court
and
that
the
trial
court
found
in
its
21
findings
of
fact
did
not
support
that,
nor
did
the
eighth
circuit
when
they
found
that
find
anything
clearly
erroneous
in
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
court.
so
what
we
have
here,
again
if
i
may
respectfully
continue,
is
a
newspaper
which
is
generated
in
the
second
semester
by
students
who
have
been
taught
certain
values
in
journalism
such
as
responsible
journalism,
journalistic
ethics,
copying,
writing,
story
development,
ideas
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
then
these
students
are
brought
into
journalism
ii
to
practice
that
art
under
the
supervision
of
that
teacher.
and
in
the
practice
of
that
art
the
teacher,
as
the
evidence
in
the
trial
court
was
adduced,
the
teacher
then
gave
these
students
story
lines
to
be
developed.
the
students
developed
those
story
lines,
and
those
story
lines
were
then
submitted
back
and
forth
to
the
teacher
for
as
many
as
four
or
five
revisions.
evidence
in
the
trial
court
indicated
by
the
respondent's
own
witnesses
that
a
story,
for
example,
in
this
newspaper
on
diabetes
was
not
printed
at
all.
so
the
student
had
gone
through
the
process
of
developing
a
story
on
diabetes,
but
it
just
was
not
printed.
students
were
given
grades
whether
they
printed
a
story
in
this
publication
or
not.
so
they
were
graded
not
only
on
whether
there
was
ultimate
publication
or
whether
their
article
or
their
effort
was
not
published.
some
students
did
not
participate
particularly
in
the
writing
of
articles,
but
their
major
job
was
in
the
layout,
editing,
and
other
things.
in
fact,
the
three
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
not
the
authors
of
the
story
in
question,
but
rather
were
active
in
the
production
of
the
newspaper
as
layout
editor,
and
one
of
the
plaintiffs
i
think
assisted
in
the
design
of
a
graph
that
was
used
in
the
story.
in
the
may
13th
issue
of
the
spectrum,
it
was
proposed
to
be
a
six
page
newspaper.
one
additional
fact
which
i
think
is
important
in
this
case
is
that
the
teacher
who
had
taught
these
students
in
the
fall
and
was
teaching
these
students
in
the
spring
semester
on
april
29th
was
granted
permission
by
the
board
of
education
to
leave
education
and
go
get
a
job,
had
a
better
offer
in
private
industry.
the
board
of
education
through
the
administration
appointed
an
administrative
level
journalism
teacher
as
a
substitute
teacher.
the
trial
court
found
that
this
substitute
teacher
was
a
highly
qualified
teacher,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
the
administrative
person
to
supervise
journalism.
and
the
reason
that
they
appointed
such
a
qualified
person
to
do
that
is
that
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
year,
and
two
responsibilities
remained
of
the
journalism
ii
class.
one
was
the
production
of
the
final
two
newspapers,
one
of
which
was
the
may
13th
edition,
and
the
other
one
was
the
class
legacy
paper
which
came
out
later,
both
of
which
according
to
the
testimony
were
about
90
percent
complete
when
teacher
number
one
left
and
teacher
number
two
came
in.
and
the
other
was
the
production
of
the
yearbook,
a
highly
complex
project
on
the
part
of
the
students,
which
needed
to
be
completed.
so
the
administration
sent
in
a
very
qualified
teacher.
when
that
teacher
received
the
articles
from
the
students
and
reviewed
them,
he
attempted
to
contact,
as
the
evidence
in
trial
court
showed,
he
attempted
to
contact
the
principal
about
these
stories
as
he
had
an
objection
to
them.
he
was
unable
to
do
that,
so
he
went
and
put
them
into
proof
and
sent
the
proof
to
the
principal,
and
asked
the
principal
his
opinion
about
it.
and
the
principal
said
that
those
stories
because
they
involved
the
subject
matter
that
was
in
them,
the
story
of
the
three
young
pregnant
ladies
who
told
how
they
got
pregnant,
whether
they
used
birth
control,
the
reaction
of
the
father
of
the
child,
the
reaction
of
their
parents
to
the
pregnancy,
and
other
items,
and
the
article
on
divorce
where
a
freshman
gave
a
story
of
why
or
the
recounting
of
why
she
believed
her
parents
got
divorced
and
her
name
was
involved,
the
principal
said
to
mr.
emerson,
who
was
then
the
substitute
teacher,
what
can
be
done
about
this.
now
you
recall
that
i
stated
that
it
was
a
six
page
newspaper.
the
principal
thought
at
this
time
and
the
trial
court
found,
and
no
one
has
set
aside
this
fact,
the
trial
court
found
that
the
principal
believed
that
mr.
emerson,
the
substitute
teacher,
was
at
the
printers
and
he
needed
a
yes
or
no
answer
at
this
point.
if
he
said
yes,
it
would
be
printed;
if
he
said
no,
something
had
to
be
done.
the
principal
said
what
could
be
done,
and
mr.
emerson
said
we
can
delete
page
four
and
five,
and
make
page
six
into
page
four,
and
we
have
got
a
four
page
paper.
the
principal
said
go
ahead
and
do
that,
and
that
is
what
happened.
so
the
articles
that
the
principal
had
an
objection
to
were
the
articles
involving
the
recounting
of
the
tales
of
the
pregnancy
of
three
school
girls
and
the
recounting
of
the
tale
of
why
the
parents
of
one
of
the
freshman,
in
fact
several
parents
of
students,
but
particularly
one
named
freshman's
parents
got
a
divorce,
were
deleted
and
the
paper
was
then
printed
and
distributed
to
the
class.
in
analyzing
the
first
amendment
issues,
the
district
court
distinguished
in
this
case
between
privately
initiated
speech
which
has
strict
constitutional
rights,
and
student
speech
in
the
context
of
a
school
sponsored
publication
or
activity
that
involved
curricula
matters.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
in
looking
at
fraser,
which
decided
on
the
same
day,
that
fraser
had
a
curricula
aspect
to
it.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
but
it
did
not
turn
on
the
tinker
analysis
either.
it
turned
on
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
in
the
role
of
the
school
in
inculcating
values
in
students
that
the
school
officials
had
some
interest
loco
parentis
in
the
outcome.
and
in
this
case
particularly,
you
see
the
principal's
interest
in
protecting.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
i
think
that
it
analyzed
it
a
little
bit
differently
than
that.
in
fact,
there
was
no
indication
in
fraser
other
than
a
few
laughs
that
the
speech
was
disruptive.
and
i
think
that
the
court
decided
it
on
really
the
content
and
the
people
involved
in
the
audience.
and
here
is
what
the
trial
court
did
in
our
case.
it
said
while
that
there
was
nothing
in
there
was
really
that
outstandingly
bad,
but
they
reckoned
that
the
principal
could
understand
the
school
audience
as
well
as
anyone
else
in
that
some
of
the
information
in
those
articles
might
make
it
appear
that
because
it
was
produced
in
a
classroom
exercise
that
the
school
in
effect
had
condoned
the
activities
of
these
children,
of
these
young
ladies
who
had
gotten
pregnant,
for
example.
and
utmost
in
the
principal's
mind--
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
--well,
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
right.
this
was
not
written
and
carried
about
in
the
school.
i
think
that
in
looking
at
the
story
and
the
way
that
it
was
presented
in
the
trial
court
and
not
found
to
be
erroneous
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
fact
that
the
lead
in
these
three
pregnancy
stories,
the
names
have
been
changed
to
grant
these
young
ladies
anonymity.
and
the
trial
court
found
that
the
principal
by
reading
the
article
felt
that
he
knew
who
the
children
were,
who
the
young
ladies
were.
and
if
that
was
the
case,
he
felt
that
others
would
know
who
they
were.
and
if
the
purpose
espoused
on
the
article
was
to
grant
them
anonymity,
the
article
failed.
now
again
we
have
to
take
this
in
the
context
of
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
felt
that
when
the
principal
had
the
question
placed
to
him
by
the
substitute
teacher
that
he
had
to
make
a
decision,
you
know.
and
he
looked
at
the
article
and
he
said
i
know
who
these
girls
are.
he
looked
at
the
article
about
the
divorce,
and
he
said
he
know
who
this
girl
is
and
i
know
who
her
parents
are.
i
do
not
think
that
the
parents
have
had
an
opportunity
to
respond,
the
issue
of
fairness
and
balance
is
missing
in
that
article.
the
trial
court
specifically
commented
on
his
finding
of
the
credibility
of
the
principal
in
that
case.
so
when
you
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
a
protectable
interest
even
espoused
by
the
article,
and
that
is
the
girls
should
remain
anonymous
and
the
article
did
not
protect
that,
we
feel
that
the
court
found
that
it
was
not
a
public
forum,
that
it
was
adopted
on
a
curriculum
basis,
and
that
as
a
curricula
writing
that
it
was
subject
to
the
control
of
the
principal.
the
eighth
circuit
really
said
well,
the
school
can
only
do
that
when
the
issue
would
subject
the
school
to
tort
liability.
and
in
this
case,
the
eighth
circuit
felt
that
the
only
liability
was
for
the
invasion
of
privacy
of
the
girls.
and
since
the
girls
had
given
their
consent,
obviously
their
privacy
could
not
be
invaded.
we
differ
with
that
somewhat,
since
also
the
article
mentioned
the
parents
of
the
girl,
the
husband
of
the
girl,
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
use
birth
control,
and
how
the
sexual
activities
occurred.
so
there
were
other
people
who
were
interested.
but
we
do
not
think
that
tort
liability
is
really
an
appropriate
standard.
that
here
the
interests
that
a
school
has
in
the
well-being
of
the
students
far
exceeds
whether
or
not
the
coffers
of
the
district
are
going
to
be
damaged
by
the
onslaught
of
litigation.
although
judge
wolman
in
his
dissent
said
that
the
majority's
decision
in
the
eighth
circuit
put
the
school
district
between
the
scylla
of
suit
by
the
students
and
the
charybdis
of
suit
by
somebody
else
who
was
offended
by
what
the
students
wrote.
but
still
and
all,
we
feel
that
the
true
test
is
whether
or
not,
as
expressed
in
fraser
and
similar
cases,
whether
or
not
the
school
district
has
an
interest
in
the
well-being
and
the
nurturing
of
the
students
who
were
there.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
i
think
that
it
is
similar
to
the
standard,
mr.
justice,
as
you
said
in
pico
that
while
there
may
be
some
things
that
cannot
be
removed
from
a
library,
a
school
can
make
a
decision
whether
or
not
those
articles
or
books
are
suitable
for
different
age
groups.
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
involving
students
in
a
public
telling
of
their
life
and
putting
it
in
a
semi-official
publication
of
the
school
district,
i
think
that
is
not
a
hard
decision
for
the
principal
to
make.
and
certainly
discussing
the
family
life,
the
private
lives
of
the
family
members
who
make
up
the
patrons
of
the
district,
is
not
appropriate
fare
for
the
school
newspaper.
it
would
give
an
opinion
to
the
students
that
there
was
some
bridge
or
bar
between
the
school
and
the
community
that
really
does
not
exist.
so
i
would
submit
that--
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
--well,
that,
of
course,
is
the
reinke
case,
judge,
which
the
eighth
circuit
rested
quite
a
bit
on
it.
and
according
to
reinke
v.
cobb
county,
the
federal
district
court
there
found
that
the
tinker
standard
applied
to
school
newspapers
would
not
allow
the
teacher
to
even
correct
misspellings.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
i
would
say
that
defeats
the
issue
of
journalism.
but
one
agreement
that
i
guess
that
we
had
in--
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
--well,
in
the
scheme
of
things,
as
the
journalistic
courses
are
set
up
at
the
secondary
level,
the
teacher
has
a
lot
of
control
over
good
taste.
one
of
the
things
that
they
were
to
learn
in
journalism
i
was
that
business
of
taste
and
the
community
standard.
where
that
is,
i
think
that
is
best
left
decided
at
a
local
level.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
you
can
teach
not
good
taste,
but
i
think
that
you
can
teach
an
acceptable
standard
which
does
not
suppress
viewpoint,
all
right,
and
then
allow
the
student
and
everybody
else
to
grow
as
their
time
and
maturity
grows.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that--
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
--i
think
that
they
could
do
that,
yes.
in
fact,
i
think
that
is
what
they
did
do
when
they
adopted
the
curriculum
and
the
curriculum
guide
indicating
that
the
teacher
was
in
fact
an
editor
and
not
a
censor.
the
only
objection
that
i
would
have
with
the
word
that
you
used
in
your
question
was
the
word
censor.
because
i
really
believe
that
what
a
teacher
does
in
that
case
is
edit.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
well,
the
only
distinction
that
i
have
between
censorship
and
editing
is
that
censorship
in
my
opinion
is
somebody
who
is
outside
of
the
process
who
comes
in
and
says
for
some
reason
or
other
you
have
violated
whatever
you
have
violated
and
i
want
to
stop
that
publication.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
part
of
the
process
and
defined
by
the
curriculum
to
be
so
and
encouraged
to
be
so,
and
found
by
the
trial
court
to
be
active.
and
again
we
get
back
into
the
story
line
ideas
coming
from
the
teacher,
the
revision
process
coming
from
the
teacher,
the
adoption
and
the
approval.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
never
is
no
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
but
i
believe
that
in
assigning
a
classroom
exercise
that
the
overriding
interests
of
academic
freedom,
you
know,
in
order
to
teach,
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
inherent
in
teaching
i
think
that
was
indicated
in
the
ewing
opinion
that
said
that
somewhere
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
academy's
right
to
teach
and
the
person's
right
to
speak.
in
this
case,
the
academy
is
the
hazelwood
school
district
and
it
is
trying
to
demonstrate
local
values
and
journalistic
standards.
and
while
the
argument
could
be
endless
as
to
what
the
technique
would
be
in
resolving
those,
i
think
that
is
a
balancing
between
that
and
absent
a
viewpoint.
now
again
we
go
back
to
the
trial
court.
because
it
was
established
clearly
in
the
record
that
divorce,
teenage
pregnancy,
teenage
sexuality,
abortion,
these
were
articles
that
had
been
printed
in
the
paper
before.
what
had
never
been
printed
in
the
paper
before
was
mary
jones'
abortion,
or
mary
susan's
pregnancy,
or
john
doe's
divorce.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
well,
first
of
all
again,
i
would
beg
that
the
word
censorship
in
the
classroom
be
eliminated.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
i
would
say
that
that
is
not
the
facts
that
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
and
that
is
a
tough
hypothetical.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
the
answer
is
if
you
can
establish
clearly
on
the
part
of
the
school
a
viewpoint
of
discrimination
that
that
would
abridge
fundamental
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
i
mean
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
that
is
a
fact.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
i
guess
the
answer
is
if
it
is
reasonable
in
light
of
the
circumstance,
reasonable
in
light
of
the
age
of
the
people,
reasonable
in
light
of
the
audience
that
they
are
trying
to
reach,
you
know--
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
--i
think
that
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
an
article
that
says
that
if
we
are
going
to
talk
about
it
that
we
are
not
going
to
involve
individuals.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
i
am
saying
that
he
can.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
yes.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
i
could--
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question,
in
our
petition
for
writ,
we
have
included
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit.
and
on
page
a-9
it
says,
"although
as
the
district
court
noted,
the
spectrum
was
produced
by
members
of
the
journalism
ii
class,
its
staff
was
essentially
restricted
to
students
of
the
class
and
the
spectrum
was
a
part
of
the
school
adopted
curriculum.
"
we
would
submit
that
the
curriculum
that
was
adopted
by
the
hazelwood
school
district
was
adopted
as
the
respondent's
own
witness
said
"in
the
best
fashion
for
the
teaching
of
journalism
in
a
secondary
level.
"
and
that
is
under
the
supervision
of
a
classroom
teacher
as
opposed
to
an
extracurricular,
that
the
curriculum
was
a
very
well
thought
out
and
well
set
out
correlated
with
textbook
and
classroom
instruction.
and
therefore,
it
was
a
curricular
matter
and
subject
to
the
supervision
of
the
principal.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
you
are
correct
there.
they
added
that
it
was
something
more
because
of
the
diverse
number
of
ideas
which
i
feel
is
a
finding
of
clearly
erroneous
without
saying
clearly
erroneous.
i
think
that
if
the
eighth
circuit
wanted
to
say
that
the
district
court's
finding
that
it
was
a
curricular
matter
was
erroneous
that
they
should
have
said
it
or
would
have
said
it.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
if
you
read
the
21
findings
of
fact,
there
is
a
lot
of
activity.
mr.
robert
p.
baine,
jr.
i
do
not
know,
i
really
do
not
know.
i
think
that
is
what
they
found.
i
think
that
they
found
facts.
they
read
the
evidence
and
they
read
the
record,
and
they
read
it
differently
than
the
trial
court
did.
but
without
going
to
a
rule
52,
it
is
clearly
erroneous.
thank
you
very
much.
