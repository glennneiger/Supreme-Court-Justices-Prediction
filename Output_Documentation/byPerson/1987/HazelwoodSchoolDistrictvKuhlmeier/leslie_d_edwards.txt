ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1777
in
philadelphia
at
the
public
latin
school
was
the
first
student
newspaper
called
the
students
gazette
that
we
at
least
have
a
record
of
today,
ten
years
before
the
constitution,
before
the
first
amendment
was
added.
four
authors
for
the
purposes
of
advice
both
foreign
and
domestic
for
the
reason
of
the
great
want
of
a
weekly
newspaper
got
together
as
students
expressing
their
opinions,
and
recording
who
won
certain
political
elections
for
the
state
assembly.
the
essence
of
their
ability
to
put
out
a
student
newspaper
was
their
right
to
communicate
with
each
other,
with
other
students,
as
well
as
with
other
members
of
the
school
community.
it
is
an
institution
that
existed
before
the
first
amendment,
and
i
think
that
the
fact,
and
mr.
baine
did
not
mention
this
at
all,
that
this
is
a
newspaper
has
to
have
some
effect
upon
how
the
court
looks
at
the
issues.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
three-quarters
of
the
way.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
three-quarters
of
the
way.
because
it
was
sold.
so
the
people
who
paid
a
quarter
for
it
also
contributed
to
the
funds
that
paid
for
the
printing.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
three-quarters
of
it
in
terms
of
dollar
amounts.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
hazelwood
east
high
school.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
oh,
i
am
sorry.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
let
us
start
all
over.
i
do
not
know.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
assume
because--
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
--he
sold
it
for
a
piece
of
paper.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
oh,
i
am
sorry,
public
latin
school.
that
is
the
name
of
the
school.
it
became
the
william
penn
charter
high
school.
he
sold
it
for
a
scrap
of
paper.
that
is
how
valuable
paper
was
at
the
time.
so
i
am
assuming
that
the
school
did
not,
but
i
do
not
know.
one
thing
that
he
did
not
mention
in
addition
is
the
concept
that
has
been
recognized
of
local
control
over
curriculum.
and
i
think
that
an
important
inherent
aspect
to
that
principle
is
that
it
means
ideas.
that
when
you
are
talking
about
local
control,
you
are
talking
about
local
control
over
ideas.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
no,
sir.
i
am
talking
about
the
school
district.
that
the
school
board
is
elected
by
the
people,
the
principal,
and
the
superintendent.
i
think
that
is
an
established
interest
that
they
have
which
is
valid.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
well,
i
think
that
when
you
balance
or
confront
the
first
amendment
with
that
interest
that
it
is
very
dangerous
because
it
assumes
ideas
and
viewpoint
control.
so
i
think
that
just
means
that
we
have
to
look
at
it
a
little
more
carefully.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
than
if
you
had
a
situation
of
an
army
facility
where
the
army's
interest
is
in
security,
order,
and
maintaining
a
certain
discipline.
we
are
not
talking
about
suppression.
the
government's
interest
in
that
situation
is
not
speech
related,
it
is
not
content
related.
it
is
related
to
order,
security,
or
another
government
interest.
that
is
a
little
bit
separate
sort
of
issue.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
certainly
think
that
it
does
depend.
because
they
could
have
set
up
a
newspaper,
call
it
that,
which
is
mimeographed,
which
is
used
in
class,
which
is
handed
out
in
homerooms
in
which
they
are
told
to
discuss
only
school
issues,
be
a
bulletin
board,
and
in
fact
we
are
going
to
give
you
a
weekly
interview
with
the
principal.
fine,
they
set
the
limits,
that
is
within
their
power.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
think
that
they
can
do
that,
but
i
think
that
there
would
be
trouble
doing
it
with
an
extracurricular
activity.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
well,
because
i
assume
that
extracurricular
means
that
they
are
only
putting
in
the
money
and
do
not
have
a
journalism
instructor
there.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
then
i
think
that
it
sort
of
falls
similarly
where
we
do
in
the
middle.
we
are
not
extracurricular
and
we
are
not
a
laboratory
experience
only
in
the
classroom.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
access.
the
harm
that
the
first
amendment
is
designed
to
prevent
is
that
a
viewpoint
that
the
government
does
not
like
for
any
reason
is
excluded.
and
when
you
have
students
allowed
to
make
certain
editorial
control
decisions
or
allowed
to
have
certain
access
to
their
expression
in
the
written
columns,
then
the
first
amendment
applies
and
that
is
protected.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
think
that
the
school
board,
the
principal
and
superintendent,
superiors,
can
delegate
the
editorial
function
to
an
advisor,
and
he
can
exercise
that
in
whichever
way
he
thinks
as
long
as
it
is
not
viewpoint
based.
now
if
he
says
that
it
is
viewpoint
based,
then
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
protected.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
it
does
not
serve
an
editorial
function
and
it
does
not
serve
an
educational
interest.
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
constitutional.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
that
you
can
allow
the
school
to
set
up
one
that
is
related
to
their
educational
interests,
so
long
as
they
do
not
tell
the
students
now
go
and
exercise
your
tinker
first
amendment
rights.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
do
not
think
that
it
only
has
to
be
one
or
the
other.
i
mean
i
think
that
the
school
can--
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
--if
it
is
viewpoint
based,
i
do
not
think
that
they
can.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
along
with
other
viewpoints,
yes.
they
have
to
allow
that
viewpoint,
if
that
is
what
you
are
asking.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
mean
i
think
that
the
viewpoint
discrimination
is
sort
of
a
key
to
what
they
did
in
this
case.
and
it
reminds
me
of
something
that
you
asked
about
of
mr.
baine.
the
1977
article
on
pregnancy
said
this
is
horrible,
trauma,
leaves
scars,
do
not
ever
do
this,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with,
you
know,
being
a
good
person
in
school.
the
1987
article
says
i
am
happy
having
this
baby.
and
the
effect,
whether
the
principal
intended
it
or
not,
was
to
leave
out
that
what
he
perceived,
which
you
categorized
as
a
moral
choice
in
some
sense,
to
leave
out
that
one
viewpoint
that
that
one
student
had
which
said,
you
know,
this
is
okay
for
me
today.
and
to
only
allow...
because
for
some
arbitrary
reason
this
article
on
pregnancy
was
allowed
ten
years
before...
to
only
allow
the
viewpoint
that
this
is
a
horrible
thing,
and
do
not
dare
go
and
do
anything
like
this
if
you
want
to
be
a
decent
person.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
pair
a
newspaper
with
what
they
teach
in
social
studies.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
because
student
expression
as
opposed
to
the
teacher's
control
of
content
of
a
classroom
is
a
difference.
the
life
and
families
class
at
hazelwood
east
taught,
and
he
was
interviewed
for
our
articles,
taught
one
viewpoint
in
class
with
curriculum.
that
is
curriculum,
that
is
totally
curriculum.
i
do
not
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
student
expression.
i
mean
sure
you
have
to
answer
a
question,
you
might
have
to
write
a
paper.
and
it
is
conceivable
that
you
could
get
some
first
amendment
protection
down
the
road,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
close.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
not
to
pay
for
it,
not
to
have
an
advisor.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
and
not
to
allow
the
other
viewpoint
to
be
presented.
to
only
have
one
viewpoint,
you
would
have
to
have
no
school
newspaper,
yes.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
oh,
sure.
that
is
both
viewpoints
to
be
presented.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
oh,
i
am
sorry,
did
you
say
that
the
school
could
require
them
to
put
that
in?
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
no.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
do
not
believe
that
is
required
at
all.
i
do
not
think
that
anybody
said
that
they
had
to
have.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
that
they
would
have
to
put
in
a
story.
the
point
is
excluding
a
viewpoint.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
no.
the
school
is
not
the
editor.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
if
that
is
all
the
students
wanted
to
say,
and
it
is
open
to
the
discussion
of
student
ideas
at
this
level.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
well,
we
did
not
require
a
newspaper
to
with
a
political
candidate.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
so
i
do
not
think
that
a
school
newspaper
could
either.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
yes,
through
the
advisor
and
through
accuracy.
i
think
that
if
you
had
to
push
it
that
the
principal
could
reach
down
and
say
this
is
not
accurate,
but
he
has
to
check
it
out.
he
cannot
just
say
this
is
reasonable
belief
by
one
person
by
his
thought
that
this
is
not
accurate.
he
would
have
to
either
go
to
somebody
with
training
in
journalism
or
he
would
have
to
let
the
advisor
do
it,
or
investigate
it
himself
and
have
some
objective
facts
to
allow
that.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
yes,
my
sort
of
knee-jerk
response
i
am
afraid.
i
really
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
mean
i
think
that
it
has
so
much
to
do
with
other
things
such
as
public
access
and
things
to
the
airwaves
and
things
like
that,
i
really
do
not
know.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
not
if
the
content
is
placed
and
delegated
to
the
students
or
jointly
with
the
students'
advisor,
and
not
if
it
is
discussion
or
an
expressive
vehicle
as
they
admit
this
paper
was
for
student
expression.
i
think
that
when
you
get
student
expression
involved,
then
the
school's
control
cannot
be
absolute.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
if
he--
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
--frankly,
i
think
that
it
is
not
very
strong,
no.
i
would
say
that
the
advisor
has
the
ability
and
the
right
because
of
his
expertise
to
do
some
editorial
function.
that
has
been
delegated
by
the
school
to
him,
and
that
is
different
than
the
principal.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
yes,
sir.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
that
they
reached
up
and
got
someone
who
was
not
part
of
the
editorial
function
who
was
not
skilled
in
journalism
or
experienced,
and
did
it
for
a
reason
other
than
journalistic
standards
or
editorial
discretion.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
the
advisor,
that
he
could
do
that?
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
because
the
advisor
is
part
of
what
has
been
delegated
by
the
school
to
be
the
training
and
practicing
of
student
expression.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
no,
i
think
that
they
have
to
be
journalistically
involved,
so
the
motivation
of
the
school
is
good
journalism
and
not
a
viewpoint.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
the
constitutional
line
comes
with
whether
student
expression
is
protected
or
not.
once
it
is,
then
i
think
that
the
scrutiny
has
to
be
very
strict.
i
thought
that
we
were
talking
about
a
very
detailed
situation
where
the
actual
censorship
was
done
by
one
person
at
one
level
with
a
certain
motivation
as
opposed
to
another.
so
that
detail
is
not
to
me
of
constitutional
limits,
but
the
censorship
is.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
think
that
is
because
of
tinker.
i
do
not
think
that
has
so
much
of
a
policy
aspect
except
of
the
school's
educational
interests.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
think
that
he
could
do
that.
now
i
am
hoping
that
is
not
a
practical
situation.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
no.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
sure.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
when
the
government
is
the
publisher,
i
do
not
think
that
we
can
equate
it
to
one
person
with
the
same
rights
as
the
private
press.
i
do
not
have
a
very
good
answer
for
that
difficult
question.
i
do
not
think
that
the
students
have
to
be
involved
in
that
if
it
is
their
expression.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
well,
why
would
a
student
newspaper
need
to
be
either.
i
mean
i
think
that--
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
--i
think
that
private
newspapers
print
offensive
things
all
of
the
time
to
some
portions
of
the
population.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
well,
you
have
this
advisor,
this
instructor
supposing
monitoring
it
a
little.
i
mean
there
may
be
some
restraint
because
you
have
a
teacher,
you
have
an
advisor,
you
have
a
curriculum
developed
to
try
and
learn
how
to
do
it
according
to
ethical
and
journalistic
standards
that
are
better
than
the
private.
i
mean
the
private
aim
at
that
also,
but
you
have
a
little
bit
more
control
because
you
have
an
advisor
there
who
hopefully
has
some
background
in
journalism,
some
experience
perhaps
as
a
reporter.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
yes,
i
think
he
could.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
as
long
as
it
is
not
only
because
of
a
viewpoint
discrimination,
yes.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
it
seems
to
me
that
offending
the
community
would
not
have--
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
--well,
i
think
that
the
advisor
can
exercise
editorial
control.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
not
viewpoint.
well,
to
say
that
he
cannot,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it
requires
strict
scrutiny
if
he
does.
and
there
may
be
a
compelling
state
interest.
that
is
fine.
it
may
be
inflammatory.
then
he
can
constitutionally.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
yes,
if
it
is
inflammatory,
libel,
obscenity,
and
disrupting
school,
and
invading
rights
of
privacy
of
others.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
well,
i
think
that
in
attempting
to
analogize
to
the
private
press
which
has
a
reporter,
editor,
publisher
and
an
owner,
that
we
have
gotten
a
little
bit
away
from
the
first
amendment
application.
now
it
is
not
that
that
is
not
relevant,
okay.
there
is
something
that
i
think
needs
to
be
addressed
there.
but
the
main
this
is
this
protected
speech
or
not,
and
what
is
the
standard.
and
i
do
not
think
that
who
makes
the
decision
necessarily
determines
that.
i
think
that
the
type
of
speech
that
we
are
talking
about
in
a
newspaper
and
the
content.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
well,
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
as
important
as
where
the
decision
is
made
and
the
manner.
we
are
talking
about
a
newspaper,
the
content
of
it,
the
basis
for
the
decision.
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
a
very
difficult
position
for
the
advisor
to
be
in.
and
the
principal
is
far
removed
from
the
journalism
education
going
on
in
that
classroom.
i
do
not
know
if
that
really
has
any
constitutional
importance
other
than
situations
where
you
would
have
to
apply
the
first
amendment
to
high
schools
because
they
vary
so
much.
you
know,
you
might
have
the
local
newspaper
in
carol,
iowa
that
publishes
every
thursday
that
high
school's
newspaper.
the
private
publisher
says
here
to
the
students,
here
is
your
one
page,
publish
it.
you
have
got
a
school
with
a
high
educational
quality
in
hazelwood
that
says
every
three
weeks
we
are
going
to
have
six
or
eight
pages
and
we
want
you
to
do
all
of
this
journalism
aim
for
learning
all
of
these
journalism
things,
editorials,
news,
columns,
letters
to
the
editor,
everything.
and
then
you
have
a
place
that
prints
its
own
in
the
basement
of
the
school,
and
it
is
going
to
be
a
mimeographed
sheet
eight
by
the
eleven,
and
they
are
going
to
hand
it
out
to
the
people
in
the
classroom.
i
mean
there
is
just
such
a
variety
that
it
is
true
that
many
people
in
the
situations
that
the
student
press
encompasses
make
those
decisions.
i
think
that
you
can
look
at
the
issues
without
being
stuck
into
one
of
those
who
is
the
censor.

it
is

no.
21
from
the
district
court,
it
is
in
a
footnote
of
the
eighth
circuit.
there
is
nothing
in
the
transcript.
the
articles
were
never,
there
is
no
reference.
i
do
not
know
where
it
came
from.
it
is
absolutely
without
any
basis.
they
were
never
distributed.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
probably
said
it.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
no.
so
i
cannot
answer
your
question
because
it
did
not
happen,
unless
you
would
like
a
hypothetical.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
do
not
think
that
it
makes
a
difference,
but
that
is
just
my--
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
--yes.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
well,
i
might
qualify
my
answer
a
little.
if
it
were
communicated
to
the
students
in
some
manner
that
they
now
knew
that
this
was
the
new
way
to
operate,
then
it
might
be
all
right.
what
happens,
i
thought
that
you
were
asking
about--
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
--no.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
well,
i
do
not
think
whether
they
write
a
regulation
or
not
depends
upon
whether
the
first
amendment
applies.
but
i
do
think
that
the
school
can
limit
how
they
run
their
journalism
program
and
their
newspaper
as
they
put
it
out.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
he
did
not
limit
the
program.
he
did
not
limit
the
newspaper.
he
limited
one
idea.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
now
i
think
that
he
can
limit
the
whole
thing.
and
maybe,
you
know,
people
might
disagree.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
well,
there
is
some
distinction
between
practice
and
policy
i
think,
so
i
did
not
know
if
you
were
asking
about
that.
you
may
have
a
practice
that
is
different
than
a
policy,
and
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
go
by
the
practice
as
opposed
to
what
they
wrote
down.
ms.
leslie
d.
edwards
i
suspect
that
things
would
have
been
different
had
we
not
had
this
change.
thank
you.
