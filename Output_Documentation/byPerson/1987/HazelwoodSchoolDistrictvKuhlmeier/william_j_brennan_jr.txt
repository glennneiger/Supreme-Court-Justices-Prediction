well,
mr.
baine,
was
is
it
a
regulation
or
something
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
year
that
said
that
the
publication
shall
be
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
that
appeared
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
paper
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
baine,
we
have
not
analyzed
first
amendment
issues
in
the
school
context
in
public
forum
terms,
have
we,
have
we
not
usually
tested
the
first
amendment
issue
by
the
tinker
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
opinion
in
fraser
did
not
turn,
did
it,
on
a
public
forum
analysis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
not
fraser
analyze
the
situation
as
whether
or
not
the
speech
had
been
disruptive?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
baine,
what
that
really
adds
up
to
is
no
first
amendment
protection
then
in
that
circumstance,
none
for
the
students.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
where,
in
light
of
what
you
answered?
