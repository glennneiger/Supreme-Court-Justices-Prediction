justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
not
appear
in
the
editorial
section
of
the
paper?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
not
the
editorial
section
of
the
paper
say
that
the
editorials
did
not
represent
necessarily
the
views
of
the
school
or
the
school
administration?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
the
school
would
not
appear
as
condoning
it,
the
school
was
certainly
providing
the
paper
and
the
ink
and
the
money
to
write
the
story,
right,
which
was
not
the
case
in
tinker?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
their
own
arm
bands
in
tinker,
they
brought
them
from
home,
the
school
did
not
provide
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
would
go
further
than
that,
would
you
not,
you
would
say
that
the
school
could
censor
the
paper
if
it
had
a
lot
of
misspelling
in
it,
would
you
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
am
asking
what
you
would
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
journalism
professor
just
thought
that
this
article
is
in
bad
taste?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
that
good
journalists
have
good
taste,
and
that
you
can
teach
that
in
a
journalism
class?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
us
talk
about
viewpoint
discrimination.
the
principal
could
not
exclude
an
article
that
discussed
teenage
sexuality
and
pregnancy
of
some
of
his
students,
and
portray
the
whole
thing
in
a
favorable
light
in
effect
sanctioning
promiscuity
by
the
students,
but
would
permit
an
article
that
discussed
the
same
topic
but
seemed
to
frown
upon
that
kind
of
activity,
that
the
principal
could
not
take
a
position
on
a
subject
like
that.
if
he
allows
sexuality
to
be
talked
about,
he
has
to
allow
both
the
pros
and
the
cons
of
adolescence
sex
to
be
set
forth,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
says
we
are
trying
to
form
some
moral
attitudes
in
the
kids
in
this
school.
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
this
school
does,
and
i
do
not
want
an
article
that
condones
this
sort
of
thing.
is
he
going
to
be
able
to
do
that
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
this
case.
i
just
want
to
know
your
position.
are
you
categorical
that
the
principal
or
whoever
has
the
last
word
cannot
exercise
that
last
word
on
the
basis
of
some
value
judgments
that
discriminate
between
various
positions
on
particular
issues?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
school
pay
for
this
newspaper
that
you
are
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
pardon.
justice
scalia
but
the
school
funded
the
printing
and
whatnot?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
school
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
i
am
not
talking
about
this
one.
i
am
talking
about
the
one
in
1777.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
this
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
not
think
that
makes
a
difference?
justice
scalia
do
you
not
think
that
makes
a
difference...
what
was
the
school,
what
was
the
school?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
name
of
the
school
in
1777?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
either
have
to
have
no
school
paper
or
you
have
to
have
a
school
paper
that
carries
articles
like
smoking
pot
is
fun,
that
is
the
constitutional
choice?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
do
not
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
could
set
up
a
newspaper
then
and
say
you
are
not
going
to
have
any
articles
in
it
that
encourage
the
smoking
of
pot,
i
can
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
cannot.
so
i
either
have
to
have
no
newspaper
or
i
have
to
have
a
newspaper
that
has
articles
encouraging
the
kids
who
go
to
that
school
to
smoke
pot.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
your
position
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
teaching
in
the
school,
i
presume
that
you
could
try
to
teach
the
students
that
smoking
pot
is
no
good
or
could
you,
would
you
have
to
have
a
teacher
come
up
and
give
the
other
side
and
say
on
the
other
hand
maybe
smoking
pot
is
good?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can
the
school
enforce
a
point
of
view
in
the
one
case
and
not
in
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
only
way
to
avoid
all
of
the
good
stuff
that
you
are
doing
in
the
classroom
teaching
them
that
smoking
pot
is
no
good
is
not
to
have
a
student
newspaper,
that
is
the
only
way
that
you
could
avoid
the
school
formally
subsidizing
that
opposing
value
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
red
line
applies.
i
mean
maybe
this
is
like
the
fcc.
i
mean
this
is
after
all
a
school
newspaper.
it
is
their
type,
it
is
their
paper
and
whatnot.
so
maybe
they
do
have
to
provide
viewpoints
on
matters
of
public
controversy.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
a
constitutional
line
whether
you
are
violating
the
constitution
depends
on
whether
you
have
a
good
journalist
involved
or
not
in
the
censorship?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
not
any
newspaper
have
somebody
who
makes
a
judgment
as
to
whether
what
is
published
in
the
newspaper
will
offend
the
community,
i
assume
that
any
newspaper
does
not
try
to
publish
stuff
that
is
offensive?
justice
antonin
scalia
now
who
does
that
when
you
have
a
school
newspaper.
suppose
the
principal
says
here
is
an
article
that
is
on
premarital
sex,
it
is
an
interesting
article,
but
this
is
a
very
conservative
rural
community,
our
people
will
find
this
offensive.
if
i
were
running
the
local
newspaper,
i
would
not
run
a
piece
like
this.
now
what
if
he
makes
that
judgment.
and
if
he
cannot
make
it,
who
makes
it
in
the
school
then.
you
are
telling
me
that
you
have
school
newspapers
that
cannot
exercise
any
judgment
as
to
what
offense
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again,
you
leave
us
with
a
terrible
choice,
either
no
newspapers
at
all
or
newspapers
that
have
to
be
offensive
as
no
private
newspapers
need
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
nobody
can
stop
them.
well,
all
right,
you
have
to
get
very
responsible
adolescents
who
have
very
good
judgment
as
to
what
is
offensive
to
the
whole
community
or
not
and
care.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
do
not
try
to,
i
do
not
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
let
him
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
could
exclude
it
because
i
think
this
will
offend
the
community?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it
is.
i
mean
he
thinks
this
viewpoint
will
offend
the
community.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
students
want
to
print
something
hitler
was
right.
and
the
advisor
says
gee,
this
community
will
not
like
that
piece,
and
there
is
a
school
bond
issue
coming
up
he
thinks.
there
is
just
no
solution
for
that
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
principal?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
edwards,
if
i
recall
your
response,
you
said
that
it
would
be
okay
if
the
school
said
this
is
a
house
organ,
we
are
not
going
to
allow
everything
to
be
published,
we
are
going
to
have
the
last
word,
that
would
be
okay.
now
suppose
it
did
not
say
that,
at
the
beginning
it
said
it
is
going
to
be
a
wide
open
paper,
but
then
it
begins
behaving
otherwise,
and
it
starts
excluding
material
when
the
school
was
exercising
its
own
judgment
that
the
material
is
not
very
good.
that
would
violate
the
first
amendment
then,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
that
be,
i
mean
it
is
sort
of
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
that
depends
on
breach
of
contract
or
estoppel
or
what.
suppose
the
school
in
the
middle
of
the
school
year
says
yes,
we
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
that
it
was
going
to
be
wide
open
but
we
have
changed
our
mind,
from
now
on
what
comes
is
only
what
we
say
comes
in.
would
that
be
okay,
if
they
changed
their
mind
in
the
middle
of
the
year?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
was
done
too
informally,
so
this
first
amendment
violation
consists
exclusively
of
the
fact
that
the
principal
did
not
publish
a
regulation
or
something
to
change
whatever
course
there
was,
that
is
the
first
amendment
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
a
pretty
frail
protection,
if
that
is
all
that
we
are
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
principal
limited
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
the
ad
hoc
nature
of
it
that
you
are
objecting
to
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
not
also
some
other
inconsistency,
is
there
not
a
footnote
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
says
that
there
was
no
active
involvement
brought
by
the
instructor
in
the
production,
and
a
flat
finding
by
the
district
court
that
there
was
active
involvement
by
the
instructor?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
did
the
court
of
appeals
get
that
from?
