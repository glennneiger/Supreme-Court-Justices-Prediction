ms.
colleen
k.
connell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
hartigan
has
not
met
his
burden
of
establishing
either
obligatory
or
discretionary
jurisdiction
to
review
the
issues
he
now
raises
nor
has
he
satisfied
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
illinois
statute
is
carefully
enough
drawn
to
achieve
a
significant
state
interest
without
burdening
the
exercise
of
fundamental
right.
there
is
no
jurisdiction
here
under
section
1254
because
the
7th
circuit
did
not
enter
a
final
order
declaring
the
illinois
statute
invalid
as
repugnant
to
the
constitution.
starting,
first,
with
the
finality
portion,
the
7th
circuit's
decision
remanded
this
matter
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
likewise,
the
7th
circuit
did
not
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
instead,
as
mr.
hartigan
recognized
in
his
jurisdictional
statement
to
this
court,
the
7th
circuit
specifically
reserved
the
issue
of
the
act's
ultimate
constitutionality.
the
reason
the
7th
circuit
reserved
the
issue
of
the
act's
constitutionality
was
because
the
7th
circuit
found
that
the
statute
by
its
own
terms
was
incomplete.
it
was
incomplete
because
the
statute
specifically
sets
out
a
desire
by
the
illinois
general
assembly
for
a
judicial
by-pass
for
any
young
woman
who
cannot
tell
either
both
of
her
parents
or
one
of
her
parents
about
her
pregnancy
and
her
desire
to
have
an
abortion.
now,
this
incomplete
statutory
scheme
is
really
at
the
root
of
the
jurisdictional
efficiency
that
we
have
here.
the
statute
itself
in
sections
5(f)
and
5(g)
specifically
say
that
a
confidential
and
expedited
appeal
shall
be
available
as
the
illinois
supreme
court
provides
by
rule.
in
the
next
provision
of
the
statute,
the
general
assembly
respectfully
requests
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
promulgate
any
rules
necessary.
mr.
hartigan's
counsel
misstates
the
statute
when
he
contends
that
the
statute
calls
for
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
promulgate
any
rules
that
it
thought
were
necessary.
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
the
statute
says
any
rules
and
regulations
necessary
to
ensure
that
proceedings
under
this
act
are
handled
in
an
expeditious
and
confidential
manner.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
your
honor,
the
existing
illinois
rules
are
not
adequate.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
your
honor,
there's
been
no
indication
that
that
is
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
thinks.
further,
your
honor,
there
is--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--no.
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
is
perhaps
intending
any
disrespect
for
the
illinois
general
assembly,
but
the
illinois
supreme
court
is
a
separate
branch
of
illinois
government,
under
the
illinois
constitutional
scheme,
and
it
can
act
or
decline
to
act
for
any
variety
of
reasons,
your
honor,
and
what
has
happened
here
really
is,
i
believe,
a
stalemate
between
the
illinois
general
assembly
on
the
one
hand,
which
wants
this
statute,
and
which
wants
a
judicial
by-pass
system
with
rules,
and
that
the
illinois
general
assembly
wants
additional
rules,
your
honor,
cannot
be
in
question
because
after
the
7th
circuit
decision,
both
houses
of
the
illinois
general
assembly
past
a
resolution
calling
again
for
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
promulgate
those
rules.
and
that
rules
are
necessary,
just
briefly,
is
apparent
just
because
the
most
obviously,
there
are
no
rules,
for
example,
in
the
illinois
system
governing
confidentiality.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
well,
your
honor,
it
has
always
troubled
us.
the
reason
that
we
sought
to
enjoin
the
statute,
justice
scalia,
is
because
mr.
hartigan,
although
conceding
in
the
district
court
that
the
statute
clearly
anticipated
additional
rules,
wanted
to
enforce
that
statute
without
the
rule.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
your
honor,
the
injunction
prevents
the
enforcement
of
the
statute,
but
it
does
not,
as
required
by
section
1254,
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
instead,
it
leaves
open
an
opportunity
for
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
promulgate
the
rules
that
the
legislature
specifically
requested.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
if
that
opportunity--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--your
honor,
if
the
illinois
general...
excuse
me.
if
the
illinois
supreme
court
chooses
not
to
act,
that
is
an
independent
decision
by
a
state
body
of
government,
and
with
respect
to
mr.
hartigan
being
forever
barred
from
enforcing
the
statute,
that
is
because
the
statute
as
designed,
as
written,
calls
for
rules,
and
the
general
assembly,
when
it
passed
the
statute,
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
illinois
supreme
court's
action
was
needed
before
there
could
be
such
rules.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
ruling
below
that
satisfies
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
this
court
because
even
though
it
may
be
a
final
decision
with
respect
to
whether
the
statute
is
incomplete.
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
final
ruling
that
the
act
itself
is
unconstitutional.
indeed,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
mr.
hartigan,
in
his
jurisdictional
statement,
conceded
that
the
7th
circuit
did
not
strike
the
statute
down.
it
reserved--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
the
same
constraint
that
caution
against
the
exercise
of
obligatory
jurisdiction
also
counsel
against
the
exercise
of
discretionary--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
with
respect
to
the
questions
that
mr.
hartigan
now
raises,
if
this
court
were
to
decide
to
grant
certiorari
jurisdiction,
there
would
be
a
substantial
risk
perhaps
of
issuing
an
advisory
opinion
because
the
issues
that
mr.
hartigan
asks
review
on
of
whether
this
statute
requires
rules,
when,
in
fact,
the...
excuse
me.
of
whether
the
statute
is
constitutional
without
rules
is
taken
care
of
by
the
fact
that
the
statute
itself
asks
for
rules.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
that's
right,
your
honor.
no
question
about
that.
but,
again,
to
reiterate,
i
think
that
the
standards
that
this
court
has
adhered
to
consistently
since
the
decision
in
ashwander,
clearly
the
doctrine
of
necessity,
counsel
against
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
here.
we
have
a
court
of
appeals
which
was
being
sensitive
to
the
comity
concerns
expressed
by
this
court
in
a
multitude
of
decisions,
saying
we
are
not
going
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
prematurely.
we
are
not
going
to
strike
down
the
statute
before
we
provide
the
illinois
supreme
court
an
opportunity,
a
continuing
opportunity
to
fulfill
its
constitutional
role
and
to
promulgate
rules
that
might
bring
the
statute
in
compliance
with
the
constitution.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
your
honor,--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--your
honor,
approximately
eighty-eight
days,
my
recollection.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
your
honor,
the--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--answer
is
that
it
varies
because--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--the--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
no,
your
honor,
we
didn't
jump
the
gun
because
had
we
not
filed
for
injunctive
relief
in
the
district
court,
mr.
hartigan
and
his
co-defendant,
mr.
daley,
who
is
a
representative
of
all
the
states
attorneys
in
the
state
of
illinois,
were
prepared
to
enforce
that
law
without
the
rules
that
the
statute
requested,
even
though,
as
mr.
hartigan
conceded,
rules
were
clearly
anticipated
by
the
statute
itself.
now,
the
consequences
of--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--some
kind
of
stand-off.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
stand-off
is
an
issue
really
to
be
resolved
by
the
illinois
state
constitutional
systems
and
the
illinois
state
government.
if
the
illinois
general
assembly
does
not
want
to
persist
in
its
desire
for
judicial
by-pass,
which
needs
action
by
an
independent
branch
of
the
illinois
government,
then
the
illinois
general
assembly
can
amend
the
statute
to
substitute
perhaps
an
administrative
by-pass
which
this
court
has
indicated
might
be
appropriate
in
its
bellotti
decision
or
it
might
try
a
host
of
different
alternatives
to
achieve
its
desired
parental
involvement.
the
illinois
general
assembly
hasn't
done
that.
instead,
it
reiterated
its
desire
for
the
statute
to
go
as
written
with
rules
when
the
illinois
supreme
court--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
district
court
was
really
faced
with
the
issue
of
eminent
enforcement
of
this
statute
and
the
issue
at
that
point
then
became
a
federal
issue
of
whether
this
skeletal
statute
without
the
rules
requested
provided
an
adequate
framework
within
the
context
of
bellotti
and
ashcroft
that
provided
the
young
woman
with
an
assurance--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--your
honor,
i
think
the
injunction
clearly
was
properly
issued
and,
again,
i
would
say
that
certainly
the
7th
circuit
decision
which
vacated
the
decision
that
the
act
was
finally
and
completely
unconstitutional
really
struck
that
balance
that
you're
concerned
about
because
it
said,
look,
if
we
don't
continue
the
injunction,
this
act
will
go
into
effect
and
it
will
be
enforced
because
it
had
the
enforcement
agencies
of
the
state
in
court
before
it
saying
it
would
be
enforced.
so,
it
had
to
provide
some
sort
of
interim
relief,
and
to
have
abstained,
your
honor,
in
the
classic
sense
of
that
doctrine
would
have
left
the
young
women
here
without
any
protection
of
their
fundamental
rights
and
with
the
enforcement
of
a
statute
that
was
incomplete
in
its
own
terms
and
did
not
provide
the
confidential
and
expeditious
judicial
by-pass
that
the
general
assembly
intended.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
your
honor,
i
have
no
assurance
of
that,
and--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--your
honor,
the
problem
is
that
they
were
threatening
to
enforce
it
and
for
this
law
to
even
be
threatened
to
enforce
would
have
provided
a
substantial
chill
to
the
physicians
who
are
also
plaintiffs
in
this
action
and
who
would,
given
the
serious
criminal
penalties
attached
to
a
violation
of
the
statute,
been
chilled
and
would
not
have
performed
the
abortion
for
the
young
woman
and
would
not
have
allowed
them
to
effectuate
their
fundamental
right.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
that
nothing
has
really
happened.
it's
that
the
7th
circuit's
decision,
which
did
not
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional,
left
the
state
an
opportunity
to
render
it
constitutional.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
but,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
it's
not
my
statute,
it's
the
state
of
illinois'
statute,
and
that
statute
does
request
rules,
and,
really,
without
those
rules,
not
only--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--no,
your
honor.
our
concern
was
that
mr.
hartigan's
desire
to
enforce
this
statute
in
its
incomplete
form,
regardless
of
whether
it
violated
state
law
or
not,
would
have
violated
the
federal
constitution
because
it
would
not
have
provided
the
requisite
assurances
that
a
young
woman
could
pursue
a
judicial
by-pass
in
an
expedited
and
in
a
confidential
manner.
your
honor,
just
to
move
into
the
merits,
it's
that
problem
of
incompleteness
which
really
shows
why
the
7th
circuit's
decision
was
correct.
the
statute
below--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--thank
you.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
yes,
your
honor,
absolutely.
the
fact
that
the
illinois
statute
does
not
provide
and
cannot
provide
any
guarantees
of
an
expedited
and
confidential
appeal
raises
very
serious
constitutional
problems
under
the
federal
constitution.
just
briefly,
the
illinois
statute
does
not
provide
any
assurances
that
a
young
woman
can
make
an
appeal
and
preserve
the
privacy
interests
that
this
court
has
found
to
be
part
of
her
fundamental
rights.
there
are
no
provisions
anywhere
in
the
statute
itself
or
the
existing
illinois
appellate
rules
which
provide
any
guidance
or
any
provisions
for
a
young
woman
to
keep
her
identity
confidential.
there
are
no
provisions
for
filing
with
her
initials.
there
are
no
provisions
for
filing
using
a
jane
doe
pseudonym.
so,
to
compare
this
case
with
the
ashcroft
statute,
which
did
provide
for
the
specific
filing
of
the
young
woman's
petition
with
her
initials,
this
one
does
not
provide
the
necessary
assurances
of
confidentiality.
now,
the
lack
of
any
assurances
that
the
privacy
will
be
protected
is
completely
at
odds
with
this
court's
decision,
including
most
recently
the
decision
in
thornburgh,
where
the
court
held
that
the
constitution
demands
that
such
an
intensely
private
decision,
such
as
the
decision
to
end
a
pregnancy,
must
be
protected
in
a
manner
that
assures
the
young
woman's
privacy.
likewise,
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
itself
or
in
the
existing
illinois
rules
that
provide
any
assurances
of
an
expedited
appeal,
and
that's
critical
and
it's
a
critical
deficiency
because,
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
time
is
absolutely
of
the
essence
in
the
abortion
context.
now,
the
problem
with
the
illinois
system
is
that
the
timing
of
the
entire
appellate
process
is
left
to
the
complete
and
unfettered
discretion
of
the
personnel
at
the
various
levels
of
the
illinois
appellate
system.
our
experience
shows
us
that
long
delays
will
occur
even
if
an
appeal
is
expedited
under
any
of
the
existing
illinois
rules.
now,
defendant,
mr.
hartigan,
trots
out
rule
311
in
his
supplemental
reply
brief
as
a
way
in
which
a
minor
might
have
a
chance
or
possibility
of
an
expedited
appeal.
now,
the
problem
with
rule
311,
as
mr.
hartigan
recognizes
in
footnote
10
of
his
supplemental
reply,
is
that
it
provides
a
possibility
of
expedition
only
if,
only
if
the
illinois
appellate
courts
don't
apply
it
as
written.
to
not
apply
the
rule
as
written
provides
the
young
woman
no
guidance.
it
certainly
does
not
provide
even
the
framework
of
expedition
that
this
court
has
required
in
ashcroft
and
bellotti
and
in
other
decisions
in
this
area.
now,
the
problem
with
the
rule
is
also
exacerbated
by
the--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--your
honor,
i
think
this
court
answered
that
decision
in
bellotti
in
the
context
of
compelled
parental
notice
to
parents
when
their
daughter
was
seeking
to
invoke
a
by-pass
around
parental
involvement
and
the
parental
consent,
and
this
court
ruled
that
the
privacy
interests
of
the
young
woman
was
protected
even
to
the
extent
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
seek
judicial
review
or
to
seek
an
alternative
to
parental
involvement
without
even
notification
to
her
parents,
your
honor.
this
court
reiterated
its
concern--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--your
honor,
in
illinois,
if
the
young
woman
is
pregnant
and
desires
sterilization
after
the
pregnancy,
then,
when
she's
pregnant,
she
has
the
complete
ability
under
illinois
statutory
law
to
make
any
decisions
concerning
her
pregnancy
or
any
medical
procedures
surrounding
that
pregnancy
without
parental
involvement.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
if
the
young
woman
is
not
pregnant,
then
the
involvement
of
only
one
parent
is
needed,
your
honor.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
yes,
your
honor.
unless
the
minor
has
been
found
to
be
emancipated
or
is
married.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
your
honor,
the
right
of
sterilization
to
a
minor
is
something
that's
not
been
ruled
on
by
this
court,
and
i
suggest
that
it
does
not
present
precisely
the
same
constitutional
issues
as
the
abortion
issue
because
the
right
to
or
the
desire
to
be
sterilized
is
an
issue
that
can
be
deferred
until
the
minor
reaches
her
age
of
majority.
by
way
of
contrast,
the--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--your
honor,
if
she
wishes
to
be
sexually
active,
there
are
other
alternatives
as
well,
including
the
use
of
contraceptives
which
are
not
permanent,
such
as
sterilization,
and
under
illinois
law,
a
young
woman
can
get
contraceptives
without
either
notification
to
or
consent
of
her
parents.
the
problems
with
the
illinois
system
are
not
limited
to
the
fact
that
there
are
no
specific
rules
setting
the
time
frame
for
the
appellate
procedure.
mr.
hartigan
is
incorrect
when
he
suggests
that
only
the
young
woman
can
appeal
from
a
lower
court
decision
concerning
her...
denying
her
petition
to
have
an
abortion.
under
the
illinois
rule,
a
guardian
ad
litem
is
appointed
and
under
illinois
law,
as
cited
at
page
22
of
plaintiff's
supplemental
reply
brief,
that
guardian
ad
litem
has
a
right,
indeed,
even
an
obligation,
to
go
to
the
appellate
court
if
his
construction
of
the
young
woman's
best
interests
or
maturity
is
at
odds
with
the
young
woman's
argument.
further,
when
such
a
guardian
ad
litem
is
provided
for,
there
is
no
provision
in
the
illinois
statute
which
provides
for
the
payment
of
the
guardian
ad
litem's
fees.
section
5(h)
of
the
statute
only
deals
with
the
filing
fees.
it
does
not
deal
with
the
guardian
ad
litem
fees,
and
under
other
provisions
of
illinois
law,
most
pertinently
the
divorce
code,
the
guardian
ad
litem
fees
that
are
appointed
for
the
children
in
a
divorce,
the
guardian
ad
litem
fees
are
paid
for
by
the
parents.
now,
the
problems
that--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--no
mention
of
that
either,
your
honor.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
absolutely.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
no
provisions
for
that
nor
is
there
any
provision,
as
another
indication
of
the
problem
of
the
statute,
for
the
court
reporter
to
expedite
the
transcript,
and
under
other
provisions
of
the
illinois
appellate
procedure,
the
court
reporter
has
forty-nine
days
in
which
to
complete
the
transcript
and
prepare
the
record,
your
honor.
briefly,
the
problems
with
the
lack
of
specificity
in
the
illinois
rules
are
that
it
will
result
in
long
delays.
our
experience
tells
us
that
the
delays
of
two
months
are
not
uncommon,
even
in
a
situation
of
a
so-called
expedited
appeal,
where
a
seventeen
year
old
minor
with
terminal
illness
claimed
that
forced
medical
care
was
contrary
to
her
religion.
now,
the
consequences
of
delay
in
the
abortion
context
are
manifest
and
they're
not
contested,
even
by
mr.
hartigan.
the
medical
community
is
unanimous
in
its
condemnation
of
a
delay,
a
mandatory
delay,
after
an
informed
decision
has
been
made.
now,
the
reason
for
that
is
that
mandatory
delay
of
even
a
few
short
days
or
a
week
result
in
statistically
significant
increases
in
the
complications
and
in
the
mortality
rate
faced
by
young
women
who
are
electing
to
effectuate
a
constitutional--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
not
the--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--your
honor,
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
that
the
legislature
cannot
presume
that
every
minor
is
incapable
of
giving
informed
consent,
and,
indeed,
in
the
earlier
section
of
the
illinois
statute
that
i
cited,
a
pregnant
minor
with
respect
to
all
provisions
of
medical
care
is
presumed
mature
under
the
illinois
code.
now,
the
problem
with
this
mandatory
delay
in
that
it
will
result
in
medical
harm
in
exchange
for
really
nothing.
the
state
has
not
shown
how
any
purpose
can
be
achieved
by
this
statute.
there
was
no
showing
below
that
this
mandatory
delay
will
result
in
more
consultation
and
better
consultation
or
in
an
informed
decision.
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
no,
your
honor.
the
delay
attached--
ms.
colleen
k.
connell
--but
that's
still
a
delay,
your
honor,
and
as
indicated
by
the
record
and
indicated
by
the
briefs
of
appellees,
the
mandatory
twenty-four
hour
period
often
stretches
into
a
much
longer
period.
indeed,
as
this
court
recognized
in
striking
down
a
similar
mandatory
delay
period
in
the
akron
decision,
and,
your
honor,
the
problem
with
this
is
that
it
assumes,
contrary
to
the
evidence
in
this
case,
and
contrary
to
all
other
evidence,
that
no
young
woman
ever
voluntarily
consults
her
parents.
that's
the
additional
problem
with
this
statute.
even
for
a
young
woman
who
tells
her
parents,
who
consults
with
them
and
they
reach
a
family
decision
that
the
abortion
is
in
her
best
interests,
that
family
cannot
effectuate
their
decision
without
the
mandatory
state-imposed
delay
because
under
the
terms
of
the
statute,
the
physician
must
notify
the
parent
and
it's
both
parents,
and
then
wait
the
twenty-four
period,
unless
the
young
woman
and
her
family
are
willing
to
submit
themselves
to
one
of
two
additional
requirements,
each
of
which
result
in
an
additional
and
undue
burden
on
the
young
woman's
fundamental
right.
very
quickly,
those
additional
burdens
would
either
require
both
parents
to
accompany
the
young
woman
to
the
abortion
facility
or
the
doctor's
office,
or
require
the
young
woman's
parents
to
sign
before
a
notary
a
statement
that
they
have
been
informed
of
their
daughter's
pregnancy,
they've
been
informed
of
her
desire
to
end
the
pregnancy,
and
that
they
do
not
object
to
the
waiver
of
the
mandatory
waiting
period.
as
the
district
court
found
and
as
the
7th
circuit
affirmed,
such
an
additional
requirement
is
no
exception
at
all,
but
is
really
an
additional
burden
because
that
requirement
is
really
tantamount
to
publication,
especially
in
small
towns,
of
the
young
woman's
abortion
decision.
in
conclusion,
the
state
statute
here
is
incomplete
and
this
court
does
not
have
the
jurisdiction.
however,
should
this
court
reach
the
issue
on
the
merits,
the
illinois
statute
does
not
achieve
its
stated
purposes.
it
imposes
a
knowing
risk
of
additional
medical
harm
in
return
for
nothing
more
than
speculative
hope,
which
the
state
did
not
prove
below,
of
increased
or
better
consultation.
the
risk
of
this
over-broad
statute,
which
applies
across
the
board,
is
simply
too
great.
it
cannot
be
sustained
under
previous
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
7th
circuit's
decision
finding
that
in
its
incomplete
form,
it
cannot
be
enforced,
should
be
affirmed.
