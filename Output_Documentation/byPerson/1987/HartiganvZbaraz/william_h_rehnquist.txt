chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
number
85-673,
neil
f.
hartigan
v.
david
zbaraz.
mr.
hayes,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hayes,
didn't
the
7th
circuit
reserve
judgment
as
to
a
part
of
the
matter
pending
in
the
promulgation
of
rules
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hayes.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
connell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
question...
ms.
connell,
the
question
is
whether
we
have
jurisdiction
to
grant
certiorari,
not
whether
we
ought
to
grant
it.
that
was
justice
o'connor's
question.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
a
reason
why
the
court
should
not
grant
certiorari,
but
i
think
all
we
require
jurisdictionally
to
follow
up
on
justice
o'connor's
question
is
that
a
case
be
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
there's
no
question
this
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
right,
you're
right,
ms.
connell.
the
prosecution
would
have
failed
in
state
court,
wouldn't
it,
or
any
sort
of
action
would
have
failed
in
state
court
because,
in
your
view,
the
legislature
did
not
intend
the
statute
to
go
into
effect
without
rules
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
and
the
first
time
the...
the
state
attorney
general
or
mr.
daley
walked
into
state
court
to
do
something
about
this,
the
state
courts
would
have
told
him
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
you
must
be
in
some
doubt
about
your
construction
of
state
law,
if
you
feel
you
have
no
assurance
of
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
connell.
mr.
hayes,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hayes.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
no.
85-673,
hartigan
versus
zbaraz.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
