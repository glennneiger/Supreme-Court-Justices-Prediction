justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
connell,
don't
you
think
that
we
would
at
least
have
jurisdiction
if
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
whether
the
injunction
was
properly
issued
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
connell,
shouldn't
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance
either
have
abstained
to
let
the
illinois
courts
decide
whether
the
statute
could
go
into
effect
by
its
own
terms
without
supreme
court
rules
or
determine
whether
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
statute
could
go
into
effect
by
its
own
terms
and
then
act
accordingly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
proceeding
in
that
fashion
has
just
created
a
stand-off,
as
has
already
been
pointed
out.
so,
i
wonder
whether
it
isn't
appropriate
to
look
at
whether
the
injunction
was
properly
issued.
