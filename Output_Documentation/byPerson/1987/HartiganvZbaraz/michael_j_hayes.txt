mr.
michael
j.
hayes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
before
you
today
and
presents
two
issues
regarding
the
constitutionality
of
certain
provisions
of
the
illinois
parental
notice
of
abortion
act.
does
the
act's
twenty-four
parental
consultation
period
unduly
interfere
with
the
right
of
an
unmarried,
unemancipated
minor
to
make
her
abortion
decision?
secondly,
does
the
judicial
alternative
to
parental
notice
found
in
section
5
of
the
act
provide
a
constitutionally
sufficient
framework
to
provide
an
expeditious
confidential
appeal
from
circuit
court
opinion
adverse
to
the
minor?
also,
this
court
has
postponed
consideration
of
its
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
appeal
and
directed
that
it
be
considered
with
the
merits.
i
shall
initially
address
the
jurisdictional
issue.
most
recently,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
jurisdiction
under
section
28
usc
1254,
part
2,
is
appropriate
where,
as
inn
this
case,
the
order
appealed
from
is
final
and
there
are
no
facts
to
be
developed
at
trial.
this
case
falls
squarely
within
those
elements
of
section
1254.2
jurisdiction.
the
7th
circuit
order
from
which
we
appeal
is
clearly
final.
no
further
action
to
be
taken
by
the
lower
court
will
be
had
on
any
question
of
fact
or
law
presently
within
this
case.
there
is
no
additional
relief
the
plaintiff
can
receive.
there
is
no
relief
that
the
defendant
can
receive
from
any
adverse
ruling
of
the
7th
circuit.
the
district
court
cannot
reverse
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
twenty-four
hour
period,
parental
consent
period,
nor
can
it
reverse
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality
as
the
exceptions
to
that
period
found
in
section
7
of
the
act.
neither
can
the
district
court
reverse
the
7th
circuit
on
its
finding
that
the
existing
judicial
by-pass
provided
in
illinois
law
is
constitutionally
insufficient
to
meet
the
requirements
of
this
court.
the
court
has,
therefore,
issued
final
orders
on
the
unconstitutionality
on
the
twenty-four
parental
consultation
period,
section
5
of
the
act.
excuse
me.
section
4
of
the
act
and
on
the
exceptions
thereto
in
section
7.
it
has
also
issued
a
final
order
that
the
judicial
by-pass
procedures
found
in
the
act
provided
by
the
illinois
legislature
are
unconstitutional.
the
only
conceivable
action
on
remand
is
hypothetical
and
contingent
upon
the
some
day
possible
activity
of
a
party
not
before
the
court.
the
act
has
been
permanently
enjoined
and
the
statute
was
held
constitutional
inoperative.
we
contend
that
clearly
makes
the
order
of
the
7th
circuit
final.
jurisdictional
statutes
should
be
strictly
construed,
but
they
should
be
applied
in
a
practical
rather
than
a
hyper-technical
fashion.
such
an--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--your
honor,
it
could
appear
that
way,
but
a
practical
look
at
the
opinion
and
a
close
reading
of
it
clearly
indicates
that
the
statute
that
the
legislature
passed
with
its
by-pass
procedures
coupled
with
the
rules
that
exist
in
illinois
under
our
supreme
court
rules
for
appellate
practice
were
held
to
be
constitutionally
insufficient
as
they
exist.
they
did
indicate
that
the
case
would
go
back
in
any
event
the
supreme
court
ever
passed
the
rules
in
the
future.
they
might
then
consider
having
the
district
court
look
at
those,
but
as
the
case
came
before
the
7th
circuit
from
the
district
court,
it
is
clear
that
everything
that
was
there
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional
on
those
three
issues
that
i've
mentioned.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
the
rule-making
procedure,
as
far
as
i
know,
justice
stevens,
has
not
been
underway.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
excuse
me?
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
not
to
my
knowledge.
it
has
not
been
initiated.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
well,
initially,
the
supreme
court,
of
course,
would
have
authority
to
initiate
on
their
own
through
a
committee
to
draft
rules
and
to
review
the
rules.
i
suspect
the
bar
associations
and
i
suspect
any
individual
could
probably
initiate
it.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
has
not
petitioned
the
supreme
court
to
implement
rules,
to
add
additional
rules.
it's
been
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
that
the
existing
rules
provide
the
constitutionally
sufficient
framework
required
for
a
judicial
by-pass.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
they
have
not,
justice
scalia.
it's
the
intention
or
the
position
of
the
illinois
attorney
general's
office
that
should
the
injunction
be
vacated
and
a
court
of
appeals
decision
be
reversed,
that
that
statute,
much
like
the
statutes
that
were
involved
in
ashcroft
and
bellotti
could
go
into
effect
with
the
rules
that
exist,
and
that
if
additional
rules
and
fine-tuning
needs
to
be
done,
certainly
the
supreme
court
will
be
assumed
to
follow
the
edicts
of
this
court
and
provide
that
fine-tuning.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
as
to
whether
the
supreme
court--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--no,
i
disagree,
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
i
believe
that
the
legislative
intent
was
to
ask
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
to
pass
additional
rules
as
necessary,
as
they
found
to
be
necessary,
to
provide
a
constitutional
framework
for
which
this
judicial
by-pass--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
that's
correct.
the
only--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--well,
justice
scalia,
they
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
have
a
viable
statute
in
front
of
them
to
promulgate
rules.
i
think
it's
not
correct
or
illogical
to
ask
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
to
go
into
a
rule-making
process
for
a
statute
that
has
never
had
one
day
of
operative
effect
because
of
the
intervention,
we
contend,
improperly
of
the
federal
district
court
in
entering
the
injunction.
so,
this
case
is
precisely
the
type
of
case
that
congress
intended
this
court
to
review
on
appeal
under
1254.2.
the
7th
circuit
expressly
held
provisions
of
an
illinois
law
unconstitutional.
the
ruling
of
unconstitutionality
has
interrupted
a
program
which
the
7th
circuit
recognized
as
promulgated
to
further
significant
state
interest
of
the
state
of
minors
and
of
parents.
the
order
of
the
7th
circuit
requires
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
expend
time
and
resources
in
order
to
get
a
ruling
on
an
effective
statute
and
those
are
the
types
of
comity
concerns
that
1254
was
passed
to
prevent.
to
allow
a
state
statute
to
be
reviewed,
we
contend
that
if
this
case
or
this
order
is
held
not
to
be
final,
the
comity
concerns
1254.2
was
intended
to
foster
would
be
thwarted.
the
court
clearly,
in
our
opinion,
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
case.
additionally,
however,
should
this
court
determine
now
to
grant
review
under
1254.2,
we
would
ask
it
to
exercise
its
discretionary
authority
to
hear
this
case
under
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
section
2103.
there
are
important
issues
of
public
policy
involved
in
this
case
and
that
review
by
this
court
will
be
significant
in
assisting
illinois
in
this
statute
and
in
others
and
other
states
who
are
confused
and
unclear
because
of
the
decisions
in
this
case
in
the
regulation
of
these
areas,
as
to
what
are
the
boundaries
that
their
statutes
must
stay
within.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
justice
scalia,
i
would
agree
with
you
that...
i
think
that's
the
problem
with
the
appellees'
suggestion
that
this
case
isn't
ripe
because
if
it's
not
ripe
for
review
under
1254.2
because
the
supreme
court
didn't
pass
some
rules
and
those
rules
have
never
existed,
that
same
argument
means
that
it
wasn't
ripe
at
the
district
court
level,
and
that
the
injunctions
that
were
entered
were
improperly
entered.
that's
another
reason
why
i
think
the
court
has
to
find
finality
here,
and
that
the
argument
raised
on
appeal
to
this
court
that
because
of
that
possibility
of
rules
existing,
some
day
in
the
future,
it
destroys
the
ripeness
for
appeal
and
reviewing
this
case,
that
same
argument
taken
to
its
logical
extreme
in
the
other
hand
would
destroy
the
justiciability
of
the
case
in
the
first
instance
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
oh,
on
the
contrary,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
i
agree
it's
ripe
for
adjudication.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
i
agree
then
and
i
agree
now,
and
i
don't
believe,
first
of
all,
that
the
statute's
operation,
as
i'll
discuss
later
when
i
get
to
the
by-pass
procedure,
requires
in
illinois,
as
a
constitutional
basis,
the
passage
of
additional
rules.
i
believe
that
the
framework
in
the
statute
and
the
existing
rules
that
we
have
provide
the
necessary
framework
for
the
by-pass
procedures
and
the
standards
set
for
those
procedures
by
this
court.
i
also
believe
that
the
legislature
in
the
illinois
was
not
trying
to
make
a
judgment,
a
legal
judgment
that
the
court
would
make
in
illinois,
as
to
whether
more
rules
were
necessary.
they
left
that
in
the
section
of
the
statute
to
the
supreme
court.
they
directed
that
the
court
make
sure
that
there
is
expeditious
and
confidential
appeals,
but
they
left
that
question
squarely
to,
and
appropriately
under
the
illinois
constitution,
the
discretion
and
incision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
they
did
not.
in
fact,
i
think--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--pardon
me.
i
don't
quite
understand
the
question.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
they
have
found
that
it
was
the
intention
and
the
plaintiffs
allege
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
illinois
officials,
namely
the
attorney
general
of
the
state,
to
enforce
the
statute
upon
its
becoming
effective
as
it
existed,
and
that
because
there
was
not
what
they
believed
to
be
necessary
additional
specificity
in
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court,
the
court
enjoined
it
from
going
ahead.
so
that
the
threatened
action
of
having
the
statute
effective
was
enough
in
the
plaintiff's
view
and
in
the
court's
rule
to
get
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
statute.
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
provision
in
the
statute
for
the
twenty-four
hour
period
of
parental
consultation,
the
court
below,
the
7th
circuit,
acknowledged
that
the
state
has
significant
interest
in
promoting
parental
consultation
in
a
minor's
abortion
decision,
and
in
protecting
the
right
of
a
parent
to
be
involved
in
that
decision.
the
interest
as
to
the
child
is
based
upon
the
recognized
presumption
that
minors
aren't
able
to
make
decisions
in
an
informed
and
mature
manner
on
very
important
subject
matters,
such
as
the
abortion
decision.
the
state
significant
interest
also
takes
into
account
its
ability
to
protect
the
constitutional
right
of
the
parent
to
supervise,
direct,
nurture
and
properly
control
the
upbringing
of
their
children.
thus,
the
court
in
the
7th
circuit
recognized
that
by
requiring
minors
to
give
notice
of
their
impending
abortion
decision
to
their
parents,
the
statute
and
the
state
were
validly
promoting
the
interest
and
preserving
the
state's
interest
in
family
structure,
its
obligation
to
protect
minors
from
their
own
immaturity,
and
also
protecting
the
rights
of
individuals
as
parents
to
have
a
say-so
and
consult
with
their
minor
children
in
a
very
important
family
personal
matter.
after
acknowledging
these
important
issues,
however,
and
recognizing
that
notice
was
intended
to
foster
that
important
consultation,
7th
circuit
struck
as
unconstitutional
a
short
twenty-four
waiting
period
after
notice,
indicating
that
the
type
of
a
wait
was
too
burdensome
on
the
minor's
abortion
decision.
that
result
is
illogical
and
not
supported
by
any
precedence
in
this
court.
notice
without
time
for
a
meaningful
consultation
is
meaningless.
the
court
recognized
the
important
significant
benefits
of
parental
consultation
on
the
one
hand
and
the
need
for
parental
involvement
in
the
minor's
decision,
and
then
said
there
is
no
time
for
the
parent
to
be
heard
and
importantly
for
the
minor
to
hear
the
advice
of
the
parent.
there
was
no
time
for
consultation
to
occur.
the
court
reached
this
incorrect
position
by
relying
on
a
series
of
cases
that
struck
waiting
periods
for
an
adult
woman
seeking
to
have
an
abortion.
waiting
period
for
adults
who
have
freely
given
consent
have
been
held
to
unjustly
interfere
with
the
woman's
abortion
decision,
even
when
the
state
said,
well,
we
wanted
to
provide
time
for
the
woman
to
reflect
on
her
decision.
that's
not
the
case
when
the
twenty-four
waiting
period
is
designed
to
provide
consultation
time
for
the
parent
and
the
minor
child.
although
the
court
below
recognized
that
the
state
may
have
a
significant
interest
promulgated
by
a
statute
which
regulates
a
minor,
but
that
same
interest
would
not
be
protected
by
that
same
statute
applied
to
an
adult,
it
refused
to
apply
that
standard.
it
failed
to
apply
the
principles
to
this
case
and
instead
applied
the
standard
for
adults
to
a
statute
aimed
solely
at
unmarried,
unemancipated
minors.
it
is
obvious
that
the
twenty-four
hour
waiting
period
is
more
burdensome
on
the
minor's
decision
than
would
be
no
period.
that
restriction
is
entirely
justified,
however,
to
protect
and
promote
the
significant
interest
recognized
by
this
court
and
the
minor
to
have
the
consultation
with
his
parent
and
by
the
parent
to
have
the
consultation
time
with
the
minor.
the
state
is
not
obligated
to
pass
legislation
to
promote
its
legitimate
state
interest
and
then
leave
that
interest,
the
success
of
that
interest
to
chance.
rather,
it
is
justified,
we
contend,
in
selecting
means
that
attempt
to
guarantee
that
the
good
intentions
of
the
statute
do
occur.
we
believe
that
the
twenty-four
hour
waiting
period,
a
very
short
time
for
consultation
after
notice,
clearly
outweighs
any
burden
or
risk
or
interference
with
a
minor's
abortion
decision.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
there
are
no
costs
to
the
minor.
the
state,
either
through
the
county
or
through
the
state
appropriations
system,
will
provide
the
services
of
the
guardian
ad
litem
and
a
court-appointed
attorney
as
well.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
yes,
it
is
set
out.
it's
directed
to
be
provided
to
the
minor.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
in
drafting
and
passing
the
parental
notice
of
abortion
act,
the
illinois
legislature
elected
to
include
a
judicial
alternative
to
notice.
the
judicial
alternative
found
in
section
5
of
the
act
is
intended
to
allow
a
minor
who
believes
she
is
informed
enough
and
mature
enough
to
make
her
own
decision
without
parental
consultation
and
guidance
or
a
minor
who
believes
it's
in
her
best
interests
not
to
notify
her
parents,
to
waive
or
by-pass
that
notice
provision.
the
waiver
of
notice
provisions
are
found
in
section
5.
they
provide
that
a
minor
can
proceed
in
court
on
his
own.
a
guardian
ad
litem
will
be
appointed.
an
attorney
will
be
appointed.
the
proceedings
will
be
confidential
and
anonymous.
the
decision
will
be
rendered
within
forty-eight
hours
from
the
filing
of
the
petition.
the
standard
that's
set
forth
in
the
statute
leaves
the
court
only
two
findings,
provides
two
bases
for
the
review
to
the
judge.
that
the
person
is
mature
and
informed
enough
to
make
her
own
decision
and
that
notice
to
the
parents
is
not
in
her
best
interests.
those
were
taken
right
from
the
constitutional
decisions
of
this
court.
the
court
also...
the
statute
also
requires
the
court
to
make
written
findings
and
provide
a
confidential
record,
expedited
confidential
appellate
process
is
provided
for
in
the
statute,
and
only
the
minor
can
appeal
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court.
of
course,
as
i
mentioned,
there
will
be
no
fees.
so,
the
economic
burdens
that
may
have
been
argued
and
applied
in
this
case
are
taken
away
by
the
statute.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
yes.
there
are
no
filing
fees.
in
addition,--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--it's
the...
our
belief
that
the
legislature
intended
in
this
act
when
they
provide
that
a
guardian
ad
litem
will
be
appointed
and
that
the
court--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
correct.
in
reviewing
the
provisions
of
this
judicial
alternative
to
parental
notice,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
all
the
cases
they
relied
on
to
require
by-pass
alternatives
have
been
consent
statutes,
not
notice
statutes.
the
court
required
alternative
procedures
in
those
cases
because
a
parent
could
veto
or,
as
a
blanket
veto,
block
the
minor's
abortion
decision.
illinois
has
elected
to
promote
the
significant
interest
fostered
by
parental
involvement
in
the
minor's
abortion
decision
through
notice
and
not
consent.
assuming,
however,
that
the
same
alternative
procedures
are
constitutionally
mandated
in
a
notice
only
statute,
as
has
been
required
by
the
court
in
ashcroft,
the
illinois
statutory
provisions
as
they
exist
are
constitutionally
sufficient
as
a
framework
to
meet
the
standard
for
alternative
procedures
set
out
in
ashcroft.
in
enacting
section
5,
illinois
has
elected
to
provide
a
by-pass
procedure
for
parental
notice
that
provides
each
of
the
characteristics
this
court
has
declared
necessary
in
ashcroft.
the
court
provides
for
an
alternative
by
having
an
expeditious
court
proceeding,
respects
the
anonymity
of
the
minor,--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--certainly.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
illinois
has
decided
that
by
choosing
a
two-parent
notification
statute
that,
as
we
know
from
our
cases,
both
parents
have
a
right
to
raise
and
nurture
and
guide
their
child.
it's
not
a
right
that
is
established
just
for
one
parent.
we
know
very
clearly
that
whether
it
be
the
mother
or
the
father,
each
together
and
perhaps
separately
are
entitled
to--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--it
certainly
does
because
if
you
view
the
statute
only
looking
from
the
benefits
to
the
child,
there's
another
purpose
that
this
court
has
recognized
and
our
statute
provides,
and
that's
the
right
of
parents.
parents,
it
must
be
remembered,
have
the--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--no.
both
parents
also
applies
to
best
interests
for
the
child,
as
i
pointed
out.
the
child
has
a
right
to
expect,
both
the
father,
the
mother,
perhaps
bringing
different
perspectives
to
the
decision,
different
considerations,
to
receive
that
input
and
involvement
in
the
process.
but,
in
addition
to
that,
both
parents
have
a
constitutional
right,
we
contend,
to
make
those
decisions
and
help
nurture
their
child.
the
act
also
provides
appropriate
standards
for
waiver.
it
removes,
as
we
talked
about
earlier,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
all
economic
considerations.
this
court
has
required
no
more
when
it's
approved
the
parental
consent
statute
in
ashcroft.
the
court
of
appeals
held
section
5
constitutionally
insufficient
because
it
did
not
with
great
specificity
contain
each
and
every
provision
for
implementation.
further,
the
court
held
too
much
was
left
to
judicial
discretion,
particularly
on
appeal,
and
i
point
out
that's
although
in
the
opinion
itself,
the
court
recognized
and
held
that
under
supreme
court
rules
that
exist,
the
minor
has
an
unquestionably
good
opportunity
for
expeditious
appeals.
right
in
their
decision,
but,
yet,
they
find
there's
more
required,
more
specificity
on
implementation.
this
court
has
not
required
such
detail
and
specificity
when
reviewing
a
statute
such
as
this
one,
especially
when
it's
been
attacked
before
enforcement
as
faciously
unconstitutional.
the
statutory
alternative
has
been
approved.
it
provides
a
framework
in
which
a
by-pass
procedure
can
work
to
facilitate
an
expeditious
and
confidential
appeal.
appellants
contend
that
illinois
provisions
relative
to
waiving
the
parental
notice
requirement
provide
just
such
a
framework.
as
in
ashcroft,
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
believe
that
illinois
courts
will
disobey
or
ignore
the
constitutional
mandates
in
implementing
this
by-pass
procedure.
the
edicts
of
this
court
as
to
what
is
constitutionally
required
will
certainly
limit
or
shape
the
discretion
of
illinois
courts
to
the
extent
it
may
exist.
this
is
especially
true
in
a
case,
as
here,
where
the
statute
was
enjoined
prior
to
its
effective
date.
the
illinois
legislature,
out
of
respect
for
the
state
constitutional
provision
requiring
separation
of
powers,
requested
that
the
court
promulgate
any
rules
it
found
necessary
to
ensure
the
proceedings
under
this
act
are
handled
in
an
expeditious
and
confidential
manner.
the
legislature's
request
clearly
evidences
their
concern
that
a
statute
which
advances
such
significant
interests
be
implemented
as
this
court
directs.
what
additional
rules,
if
any,
need
be
implemented
will
await
this
court's
ruling
on
whether
the
existing
statute
and
rules
provide
a
constitutionally
sufficient
framework
to
provide
expeditious
and
anonymous
judicial
alternatives
to
notice.
we
respectfully
request
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
7th
circuit
court
of
appeals,
that
the
twenty-four
hour
consultation
period
is
unconstitutional--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--with
its
exceptions.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
there
is
no
other
medical
procedure.
there
are
the
standard
procedures
in
illinois
for
parents
to
consent
to
surgical
procedures
and
medical
service
for
their
minor
children.
there
is
a
statute,
as
pointed
out
in
the
briefs,
that
allows
pregnant
minors
to
consent
to
surgical
procedures.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
that's
correct.
we
would
also
ask--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--i
would
require
parental
consent.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
consent.
that
notice.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
i
believe
one
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
in
the
judicial
alternative,
we
would
ask
also
that
the
court
reverse
that
decision
of
the
7th
circuit.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
appellees
make
significant
argument
about
the
fact
that
in
their
view
the
illinois
legislature
has
commanded
that
additional
rules
be
instituted
before
the
statute
can
meet
the
standards
that
the
legislature
was
attempting
to
meet,
namely
those
in
the
ashcroft--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
no,
i
don't
believe
that
it
did.
the
7th
circuit,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
opening
argument,
recognized
that
surely
a
minor
has
an
opportunity
for
an
expeditious
appeal
with
the
present
illinois
supreme
court
rules.
they
recognized
that
right
in
their
opinion.
what
they
went
on
to
say
is
that's
not
good
enough
here.
we
want
more
specificity.
we
contend
that
in
a
facial
attack
on
our
statute
and
our
existing
rules
as
they
applied
to
form
this
by-pass,
you
cannot
apply
as
appellees
have
done
and
as
applied
to
argument,
that
we
know
a
case,
we
had
an
experience
where.
well,
if
those
occur
and
maybe
they
will
occur
ultimately,
those
are
improper
standards
to
apply
in
a
statute
and
a
statutory
scheme
that
has
been
attacked
as
facially
unconstitutional
prior
to
its--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--justice
stevens,
the
difference
between
the
confidentiality
provided
in
illinois
and
that
which
was
recognized
and
provided
in
missouri
and
ashcroft
is
that
the
statute
said
a
minor
can
use
their
initials.
our
statute
said
the
minor
may
proceed
in
a
confidential
and
anonymous
fashion
and
we
have
a
court
tradition
in
illinois
clearly
recognized
that
in
many
cases
cited
in
the
briefs
that
the
courts
allow
the
use
of
pseudonyms.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
they
first
found
that
the
confidentiality
requirement
and
the
expedition
of
appeal
were
necessary
in
a
pure
notice
statute,
and
then,
having
found
that,
held
that
our
statute
did
not
meet
the,
in
their
opinion,
standards
set
forth
in
ashcroft
as
providing
a
constitutionally
sufficient
framework
to
allow
for
confidentiality
and
expedition.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
they
are
essential
to
the
by-pass
procedures
that
were
outlined
and
articulated
by
ashcroft--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--i
do.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
again,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
consider
fully
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
twenty-four
hour
parent
parental
consultation
period
to
allow
what
has
been
recognized
as
a
very
important
and
significant
role
for
both
the
minor,
a
right
of
the
minor
to
hear
and
a
right
of
the
parent
to
have
input
in
to
a
very
important
decision
the
minor
will
make,
to
allow
some
time
for
that
to
occur.
we
would
also
this
court--
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
--we
do
ask
it
of
both
parents.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
the
statute
provides
very
clearly
that
if
it's
unreasonable
to
reach
that
parent,
then
the
parent...
then
the
parent
that
is
present
and
reachable
is
sufficient.
mr.
michael
j.
hayes
that's
really
a
question
of
whether
it's
reasonable
to
reach
him
or
not,
i
would
suspect.
if
it's
so
far
that
they
can't
get
ahold
of
him,
there
is
always
the
opportunity
to
begin
a
by-pass
procedure
with
the
mother
or
the
present
parent
along
with
the
child
that,
of
course,
would
very
quickly
the
judge
and
the
circuit
court
would
obviously
grant
that.
thank
you.
