justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
what
is
the
status
of
the
rule-making
procedure
proceeding
before
the
illinois
supreme
court?
i
assume
it's
in
progress.
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
anybody
initiated
that
or
taken
any
action
to
get
that
work
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
it
been
initiated?
has
anybody
proposed
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
is
responsible
for
initiating
it,
do
you
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
the
attorney
general
of
the
state?
has
he
done
anything
about
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean,
mr.
hayes,
that
there
need
not
have
even
be
a
lawsuit
filed,
the
statute
would
not
have
had
any
legal
effect
until
the
rules
were
promulgated?
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then,
why
wasn't
it
ripe
for
adjudication?
if
it
did
have
legal
effect
right
away,
why
wouldn't
it
have
been
ripe
for
adjudication?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
at
the
time
of
the
district
court's
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
how
this
statute
would
work
without
the
supreme
court
rules?
it
has
a
provision
in
it
for
a
guardian
ad
litem,
as
i
understand
it,
for
the
minor
who
comes
in
and
asks
for
judicial
by-pass
of
the
consent
provision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
pays
the
guardian
ad
litem's
fee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
set
out
in
the
statute
or
is
that...
what's
the
source
of
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
state
expense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure?
are
you...
when
you
say
that
there
are
no
fees,
is
it
the
no
filing
fees
in
sub-section
(h)
of
section
5
that
you
rely
on
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
source
of
the
statement
no
attorneys
fees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that's
your
instruction
of
the
general
legislative
intent
rather
than
any
specific
finding
in
the
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
hadn't
found
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hayes,
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
reason
for
notice
to
both
parents?
why
isn't
notice
to
one
parent
sufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
shed
light
on
the
state's
interest
in
being
sure
that
the
child
is
having
the
benefit
of
sympathetic
advice
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
rely
on
that
right
to
justify
notice
to
both
parents.
you
don't
rely
on
just
the
best
interests
of
the
child
for
that
reason.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
the
illinois
supreme
court
thinks
the
present
structure
of
illinois
rules
in
the
appellate
courts
is
adequate
to
accomplish
that
and,
so,
nothing
more
is
necessary?
what
if
they've
looked
at
it
and
they've
so
concluded?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
tell
us
they're
not.
now,
maybe
you're
right,
but
what
if
i'm
an
illinois
supreme
court
justice
and
i
disagree
with
you,
and
i
think
what
we've
got
now
is
perfectly
okay?
what
would
i
have
to
do?
nothing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
certainly
has.
they
haven't
taken
any
action.
i
assume
that
they
respect
the
general
assembly
when
the
general
assembly
asks
them
to
do
something
they
think
is
necessary.
i
don't
think...
you
know,
they're
just
defining
another
branch
of
the
state
government,
are
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
this
because...
is
it
correct
that
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
held
that
the
statute
without
the
rules
does
not
provide
either
an
expedited
or
a
confidential
method
of
review
and,
therefore,
is
both
unconstitutional
without
that
and
it
also
fails
to
comply
with
the
intent
of
the
legislature
because
those
two
requirements,
confidentiality
and
expedition,
are
both
statutory
requirements
and
you
contend
they're
also
constitutional
requirements?
the
7th
circuit
agreed
with
you,
so
their
decision
is
both,
on
what
the
statute
means
without
the
rules
and
what
its
constitutional
status
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
attorneys
fees
for
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so,
you
basically
disagree
with
your
opponent
on
who
pays
these
expenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
notice
the
statute
requires
a
confidential
record
of
the
evidence
be
maintained.
i
suppose
you
have
to
have
a
court
reporter,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
pay
the
court
reporter,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hayes,
let
me
just
interrupt.
it
is
clear
that
the
illinois
legislature
has
commended
and
expedited
a
confidential
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
not
also
true
that
the
7th
circuit
upheld
that
the
statute
without
the
rules
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law
does
not
provide
for
either
of
those
things?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
read
their
opinion,
maybe
not
on
the
expedition,
but
i
read
their
opinion
as
saying
that
the
present
illinois
statutory
scheme
and
rules
do
not
provide
the
kind
of
confidentiality
that
is
necessary,
either
to
meet
the
word
in
the
statute
or
to
meet
what
they
regard
as
the
constitutional
requirements.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
be
right,
and
the
court
of
appeals
may
be
wrong.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
confidentiality
requirement
was
not
satisfied
under
the
existing
state
of
illinois
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
agree,
do
you
not,
that
confidentiality
and
expedition
are
essential?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
that
the
illinois
legislature...
it
was
the
intent
of
the
illinois
legislature
that
there
be
an
expeditious
and
confidential
procedure?
