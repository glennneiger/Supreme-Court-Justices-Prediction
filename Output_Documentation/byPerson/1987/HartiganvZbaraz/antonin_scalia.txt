justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
his
position
as
to
whether
the
statute
itself
is
operative
if
those
rules
are
never
promulgated?
i
mean,
it
might
well
be
constitutional
to
apply
the
statute
without
the
rules,
but
it
might
also
be
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
illinois
legislature.
has
anyone
illinois
court
spoken
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
question
of
legislative
intent,
though,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
to
whether
the
illinois
legislature
intended
this
statute
to
be
implemented
if
the
rules
provision
never
went
into
effect,
if
the
illinois
supreme
court
never
adopted
the
emergency
rules
that
it
anticipated.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you're
disagreeing.
i'm
just
saying
that
it
is
ultimately
a
question
of
what
the
illinois
legislature
intended.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
attorney
general
asserts
the
legislature
intended
one
thing,
but,
ultimately,
that's
a
question
to
be
answered
by
the
illinois
courts,
i
take
it,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
courts
that
have
refused
to
promulgate
the
rules
thus
far.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hayes,
do
you
think,
moving
from
the
question
of
whether
we
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
appeal,
is
it
clear
that
the
district
court
had
proper
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
suit
in
the
first
place?
as
i
understand
it,
the
suit
was
brought
with
respect
to
a
statute
that
envisioned
the
promulgation
of
emergency
rules
by
the
illinois
supreme
court,
and
the
suit
was
brought
before
those
rules
had
ever
been
issued,
and
the
district
court
jumped
right
in
to
create
the
situation
that
you
describe,
which,
in
your
words,
is
deterring
the
illinois
supreme
court
from
ever
issuing
those
rules
since
they
are
rules
governing
a
statute
that's
been
declared
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
here
make
a
finding
that
this
statute
could
be
implemented
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
ever
issues
those
rules?
is
that
a
finding
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
telling
us
that
that's
essential
to
the
jurisdiction
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
your
position,
it
is
an
essential
element
of
the
jurisdiction
that
this
statute
is
operative
without
the
illinois
supreme
court
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
yet,
neither
of
the
courts
below
has
made
a
finding
that
that's
how
the
statute
should
be
interpreted,
which
is
a
question
of
illinois
law,
but
nobody
has
made
any
finding
to
that
effect
yet.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
that
means.
suppose
you
have
a
minor
who
wants
to
have
some
kind
of
elective
surgery,
let's
say
a
facelift
or
sterilization,
whatever
you
like.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
consent.
of
both
parents?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
a
question
for
the
illinois
supreme
court
under
the
statute.
it
says
such
rules
as
are
necessary.
what
puzzles
me
is
why
does
this
incompleteness
of
the
statute
trouble
you
now
but
it
did
not
trouble
you
when
you
brought
your
suit?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
gotten
then...
you
have
been
successful
below.
you
have
a
final
order
that
prevents
him
from
enforcing
the
statute
without
the
rules,
don't
you?
he
cannot
now
do
what
he
wanted
to
do,
enforce
the
statute
without
the
rules.
the
injunction
that's
now
in
existence
prevents
him
from
doing
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that
opportunity
is
ever
accepted
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
entirely
possible
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
never
adopts
its
rules
and
forever,
nonetheless,
should
it
adopt
that
course,
this
attorney
general
is
restrained
from
doing
what
he
wants
to
do
on
the
ground
that
to
do
that
under
the
statute,
as
he
interprets
it,
is
unconstitutional.
isn't
that
the
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
asserts
it
doesn't
require
rules.
he
asserts
he
can
enforce
it
without
the
rules.
you
have
a
judgment
that
says
you
cannot
enforce
it
without
the
rules
period.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
final
determination
that
the
statute
as
he
interprets
it
is
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can't
have
it
both
ways,
ms.
connell.
if
you
want
to
attack
a
statute
which
you
interpret
as
being
a
statute
that
allows
you
to
go
forward
without
the
supreme
court
rules,
then
it
seems
to
me,
fine,
if
you
want
to
attack
the
statute
as
being
that
kind
of
a
statute,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
take
the
unpleasant
part
of
that,
which
is
when
that
statute
is
struck
down,
there
is
jurisdiction
here
to
review
the
striking
down.
but
you
want
to
have
the
one
without
the
other.
you
want
to
strike
it
down
as
being
what
you
now
say
it
is,
a
statute
that
can't
go
forward
or
that
can
go
forward
without
the
supreme
court
rule,
but
then
you
come
here
and
you
say,
no,
actually,
nothing
is
really
happening.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
declared
your
statute
unconstitutional,
the
one
you
asserted
this
statute
was,
namely
a
statute
that
allows
the
attorney
general
to
go
forward
without
the
supreme
court
rules,
otherwise
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
didn't
say
that
in
the
district
court.
your
whole
theory
in
the
district
court
was
the
state
is
going
to
go
ahead
without
these
rules
and
that
is
what
the
statute
says
and
such
a
statute
is
unconstitutional.
your
theory
in
the
district
court
was
not
enjoining
the
attorney
general
from
going
ahead
because
he's
violating
state
law;
your
theory
is
he
may
well
be
in
compliance
with
state
law
and
that
law
is
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
let
you
move
into
the
merits,
ms.
connell.
i
think
that's
fair.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
connell,
let's
assume
a
rule
without
any
by-pass
provision,
a
rule
that
requires
notification
of
the
parents
absolutely
and
one
day
after
that
notification
for
the
parents
to
speak
with
the
child
about
the
abortion.
what
cases
of
ours
say
that
that
is
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
this
apply
for
other
minor
personal
operations?
let's
say
a
sterilization.
suppose
you
have
a
thirteen
year
old
who
decides
that
she
wants
to
be
sexually
active
and
doesn't
want
to
have
to
worry
about
the
problem
of
having
abortions
later
and
decides
she
wants
sterilization,
would
the
same
constraints
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
a
non-pregnant
young
woman.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that...
and
the
consent
is
needed,
isn't
it,
not
just
notification,
but
actual
consent?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
she
wants
to
be
sexually
active
until
that
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
connell,
the
premise
of
this
statute
is
that
an
informed
decision
has
not
been
made
until
the
young
woman
talks
with
her
parents.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
speaking
with
a
doctor
who
may
not
have
her
interests
as
much
in
heart
as
her
parents
do
is
not
enough.
isn't
that
a
reasonable
assumption
for
the
legislature
to
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
delay
only
applies
if
she
wants
to
avoid
giving
notification
to
the
parents.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
she's
willing
to
give
notification
to
the
parents,
i
thought
it's
just
a
twenty-four
period.
