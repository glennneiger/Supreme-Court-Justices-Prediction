mr.
keskey,
when
the
attleboro
doctrine
prevailed,
who
regulated
the
issuance
of
securities
for
companies
like
these,
the
state
agencies,
or?
justice
jr.
specifically
as
to
the
regulation
of
the
issuance
of
securities?
justice
jr.
it
doesn't
matter
as
far
as
the
regulation
is
concerned
whether
the
regulated
company
by
michigan
is
a
michigan
corporation
or
of
some
other
state.
justice
jr.
well,
if
your
answer
to
me
is,
it
does
not
matter
whether
it's
a
michigan
corporation
or
of
some
other
state?
