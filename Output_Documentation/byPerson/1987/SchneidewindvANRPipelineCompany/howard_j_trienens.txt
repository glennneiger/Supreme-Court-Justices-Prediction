mr.
howard
j.
trienens
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
none
of
those
33
states
regulate
interstate
pipelines.
those
33
states
were
local
distribution
companies
they
were
regulating,
the
local
distribution
company
that
also
had
some
high
pressure
pipeline.
the
concern
of
the
states
at
the
1950
legislative
amendment
proposal...
might
as
well
straighten
this
one
out
the
concern
of
the
states
was
so
broad,
the
fpc
proposal
was
so
broad
that
it
brought
under
proposed
fpc
preissuance
security
regulation
local
distribution
companies.
the
states
came
screaming
in
and
said,
oh,
no,
we
traditionally
regulate
the
local
distribution.
we
traditionally
do
that.
it's
these
interstate
pipelines
like
anr
that
we
don't
regulate.
and
as
to
what
fpc
does
with
that,
that's
their
business,
but
for
heaven's
sakes,
don't
touch
these
local
distribution
companies.
so
the
fpc
comes
along,
and
it
says,
well,
we'll
amend
our
proposal,
we'll
amend
our
proposal.
we'll
ask
for
this
preissuance
authority,
this
additional
regulatory
technique
only
for
those
companies
and
those
operations
that
the
states
cannot
reach.
now,
just
to
nail
that
down,
let
me
give
you
two
sentences
out
of
that
hearing
where
commissioner
smith
made
it
very
plain
that
his
proposed
amended
legislative
proposal
was
not
going
to
impair
the
state
regulation
of
those
gas
companies
that
are
essentially
local,
meaning,
do
local
distribution.
but
here's
an
example
of
a
company
that's
clearly
beyond
the
reach
of
the
states
as
to
securities
matters.
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
regulating
the
securities
of
a
pipeline
operating
at
wholesale
within
the
state
of
massachusetts
but
carrying
gas
from
texas
to
massachusetts.
they
can't
do
that,
and
the
states
right
proponents
says,
if
that's
the
question,
it
cannot,
we
concede
that.
and
of
course
you
have
to
concede
that,
because
can
anybody
who...
take
1925,
when
the
missouri
v.
kansas
gas
was
decided.
can
anybody
believe
that
these
states
could
have
regulated
any
aspect,
securities
or
anything
else,
of
these
interstate
pipelines
when
this
court
held
that
these
lines
were
"beyond
state
interference"
or
beyond
the
reach
of
state
regulations.
now,
the
attleboro
case
which
was
electrics
is
a
very
different
problem.
justice
brandeis
dissented
in
that.
it
was
a
more
localized
problem.
even
there,
the
court
at
that
time
said
the
states
couldn't
touch
it.
that
case
is
different,
it's
electric.
congress
in
regulating
interstate
electric
power
provided
expressly
provided
that
states
could
regulate
it.
that's
a
delegation
of
the
states
that
congress
could
have
made
when
it
broke
its
silence,
it
did
make
in
the
case
of
the
interstate
electrics,
because
after
all,
they're
very
localized
really
little
grids
around
a
few
states,
and
they
sharply
distinguished
that.
and
instead
of
delegating
to
the
states,
they
created
a
comprehensive
federal
regulatory
system.
and
as
far
as
we
know,
michigan
is
the
only
state
that
an
interstate
gas
pipeline
of
this
character
has
any
problems.
we
serve
wisconsin
almost
as
much
as
michigan,
and
we
have
no
such
problem
with
wisconsin,
although
they
have
a
regulatory
statute
that
permits
a
preissuance
approval
of
securities
as
to
utilities
in
wisconsin,
but
it
doesn't
apply
to
this
company.
now,
the
premise
of
this
argument
of
michigan
is
that
somehow
financing
and
securities
are
unregulated.
that
there's
some
big
gap
that
has
to
be
filled
here.
and
i'd
like
to
show
the
court
that
that
gap
doesn't
exist.
and
it's
a
combination
of
regulatory
tools,
the
first
of
which
is
the
certification
power.
in
order
to
have
a
project
you're
going
to
finance,
you
have
to
go
to
the
fpc,
ferc
now,
get
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
before
you
can
finance
it.
for
example,
we
want
to
build
a
pipeline
extension
in
wisconsin,
say
a
$75
million
one,
and
we
have
to
go
to
ferc
and
get
a
certificate.
and
while
we're
there,
because
congress
made
it
very
express
that
congress
was
speaking
to
securities
regulation,
in
1942,
congress
expressly
authorized
ferc
to
condition
its
approval
of
certificates
and
to
modify
the
financing
as
the
public
interest
might
demand.
so
we
go
down
to
the
ferc
and
we
say,
all
right,
its
going
to
not
only
cost
$75
million
but
we're
going
to
raise
$25
million
through
equity
and
we're
going
to
have
a
$50
million
bond
issue.
that's
the
way,
that's
our
financing
plan,
and
we
get
the
certificate,
and
this
certificate
power
along
with
the
rate
power
is
described
by
this
court
as
the
heart
of
the
act.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
sir.
yes,
justice
scalia,
and
we
have
three
or
four
examples
in
our
brief.
the
inga,
a
trade
association
has
three
or
four
examples
where
the
fpc,
now
ferc,
has
done
just
that,
yes.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes.
they
say
your
proposed
financing...
congress
said
you're
supposed
to
look
at
the
financial
set
up
ferc.
so
they
look
at
the
financial
proposal.
they
say,
we
don't
like
it.
it
ought
to
be
modified
this
way
or
that
way.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
answer
is
twofold.
the
answer
is
first
as
to
the
certificate
power,
they
would
only
get
into
it
as
to
the
construction
of
the
project
being
certificated.
secondly,
as
to
the
baseball
teams,
disneyland
like
parks,
and
all
these
other
things,--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--the
answer
is
that
as
to
the
certification
power,
ferc
would
not.
it
would
get
into
its
finances
in
other
ways,
and
the
practical
answer
to
that
is
you
would
never
in
the
world
buy
a
baseball
team
through
a
ferc
regulated
corporation.
you
just
would
be
out
of
your
mind
to
put
a
profitable
baseball
team
in
a
ferc
accounting
and
ferc
regulated--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--the
only
business
that
these
two
entities
before
the
court,
pipeline
and
storage
are
in,
are
the
transportation
and
storage
of
natural
gas.
they
do
nothing
else,
they
intend
to
do
nothing
else.
and
our
companies
have
done
a
lot
of
diversifying.
we've
bought
coal
mines,
we've
bought
truck
companies.
but
we
never
do
it
at
the
ferc
regulated
corporate
level.
we
do
it
through
the
holding
company.
bear
in
mind,
these
two
entities
are
a
long
way
from
any
company
that
holds
public
stock.
the
public
holds
stock
in
a
company
called
coastal,
a
delaware
corporation
with
offices
in
texas,
coastal
has
a
holding
company
that
owns
anr
which
is
a
holding
company,
and
only
then
do
you
get
the
anr
pipelining
corporation
and
anr
storage
company.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
public
utility
holding
company
act,
when
the
company
is
subject
to
it,
did
deal
with
those
matters.
it's
true
that
somebody,
either
congress
or
the
states,
has
a
highly
legitimate
interest
in
worrying
about
over
leveraging,
over
capitalization,
all
the
evils,
all
the
financial
evils
of
the
insull
era.
and
here's
how
it
works.
as
to
the
certification
power,
the
ferc
looks
at
the
initial
financing
proposal.
as
to
the
rate
making
power,
the
debt
equity
ratio
is
a
crucial
part
of
that.
now,
it
is
true
that
it
is
only
rare
that
the
ferc
exercises
that
power
to
grant
rates
that
impute
a
different
capital
structure.
and
the
reason
it's
rate
is
that
ferc
has
made
its
standards
so
widely
known
that
you
don't
dare
go
otherwise.
you're
not
going
to
finance
it
in
a
way
you
know
is
going
to
get
in
trouble
with
ferc
so
you
always
keep
within
a
reasonable
bounds
because
ferc
makes
you.
that
takes
care
of
over
leveraging.
now,
over
capitalization
which,
if
you
read
the
michigan
supreme
court
decisions,
you'd
think
is
the
principal
evil.
just
what
is
it.
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
correctly
defines
over
capitalization
as
did
counsel.
it's
a
lack
of
correlation
between
the
debt
and
equity
on
the
liability
side
with
the
amount
or
value
of
the
property.
that's
the
problem,
lack
of
correlation.
used
to
call
it
watered
stock,
same
problem.
that
cannot
happen
under
a
ferc
regulated
company,
and
the
reason
is,
apart
from
certification,
apart
from
rate
making,
ferc
regulates
the
accounting,
and
if
there's
anyone
in
this
world
it
was
charlie
smith,
the
head
of
the
bureau
of
accounts
of
the
fpc,
who
was
the
most
vigilant
original
cost
proponent
and
insisted
on
original
cost
accounting.
so
the
assets
all
have
to
be
at
original
cost
net
and
the
liabilities
debt
and
equity
has
to
balance
and
there
cannot
be
over
capitalization
on
a
ferc
regulated
company.
it
cannot
happen.
now,
there's
one
other
thing.
they
say,
what
if
there
were
financial
ruin.
well,
if
there's
financial
ruin,
there's
something
wrong
at
ferc
because
one
of
their
duties
is
not
only
to
protect
rate
payers
but
to
have
a
financially
healthy
entity.
but
if
something
goes
wrong
and
there
is
financial
trouble,
you
have
to
go
to
ferc
to
get
an
abandonment
order.
you
can't
just
stop
serving
people
in
michigan.
you
have
to
go
to
ferc
to
abandon
service
no
matter
what
your
financial
situation
is.
so
in
all
elements,
ferc
regulates
these
securities.
here's
where
the
problem
comes
in.
the
problem
comes
in
after
you
get
a
ferc
certificate.
and
here
you
are,
you've
told
them
you're
going
to
raise
$50
million
in
bonds
to
finance
this
ferc
certificated
project.
now,
what
do
you
do.
you
go
to
your
investment
banker
in
new
york,
and
they
advise
you
on
timing
and
placement.
as
far
as
placement's
concerned,
it
could
be
domestic,
it
could
be
a
eurobond
deal.
our
last
offering
was
a
$50
million
equivalent
of
swiss
francs,
not
registered,
so
nobody
in
this
country
could
buy
it,
michigan
or
anybody
else.
nobody
could
buy
it
here.
and
then
the
other
problem
whether
it's
domestic
or
foreign
is
the
timing.
the
timing
is
everything
in
financing.
you
go
to
these
investment
bankers
and
they
say,
oh,
wait
a
minute.
hold
up
a
month
or
two.
we
think
interest
rates
are
going
up,
and
you'll
save
a
couple
of
basis
points.
or,
get
it
our
right
away,
we
think
interest
rates
are
going
up.
and
the
timing
is
everything
in
this,
and
that's
exactly
where
this
michigan
statute
intrudes
on
the
federal
process.
because
michigan
says,
you've
got
to
come
trotting
in
with
your
$50
million
proposal
to
issue
securities
to
finance
a
ferc
certificated
project.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
oh,
my,
yes.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
or
the
company
can
go
to
europe,
or
the
company
can
decide
not
to
sell
in
michigan,
or
the
company
can
get
a
blue
sky
which
is
a
very
automatic
thing.
but
the
michigan
investors
are
clearly
protected
by
the
michigan
blue
sky
laws.
they
don't
need
any
protection
to
the
swiss
buying
this
issue.
they're
protected
by
that.
they
don't
need
this
statute
to
protect
that
interest.
that's
the
point.
but
no
matter
where
the
issue
is,
and
no
matter
how
urgent
the
timing,
the
michigan
commission
is
here
insisting
that
they
have
a
right
to
have
the
securities
blocked
until
there's
an
affirmative
order
by
the
commission.
now,
with
timing
being
everything,
sure,
lots
of
times,
they'll
come
in
and
issue
it
in
three
weeks,
so
you
know,
so
you've
got
some
expense.
you've
got
expense
of
preparing
the
application,
you've
got
a
filing
fee.
all
of
that
is
in
our
view
unconstitutional,
but
that
isn't
the
real
evil
here.
the
real
evil
is
they
just
don't
approve
it.
or
they
set
it
for
hearing,
which
is
the
same
thing
as
not
approving
it.
and
the
hearing
can
go
on,
or
the
hearing
never
gets
set.
we
had
one
that
i'll
give
you
in
a
minute
that
went
on
for
a
year.
why
do
they
do
this?
what
interest
does
michigan
have?
and
i
can
speculate
on
a
lot
of
local
interests
that
they
could
try,
collateral
unrelated
local
interests
that
they
could
try
to
invoke
and
try
to
pressure
anr
by
just
holding
the
securities
hostage.
but
let
me
give
you
an
actual
and
it's
the
same
incident,
but
not
quite
the
same
story
as
you
were
told
about.
it's
the
divestiture
of
michigan
consolidated
by
anr,
the
parent.
now,
bear
in
mind,
there's
two
quite
separate
sets
of
securities
here.
one
set
has
to
do
with
the
divestiture
and
at
record
118
and
123,
the
michigan
commission
wanted
to
investigate
that,
and
they
got
out
orders
to
investigate
it.
the
orders
were
directed
at
michcon.
that's
the
company
the
regulate.
they
were
directed
at
michcon.
they
asked
anr
to
come
along
and
participate,
and
we
did.
but
the
orders
were
directed
at
michcon
and
properly
so.
now,
over
here
in
a
totally
unrelated
transaction,
ferc
had
issued
certificates
to
enable
storage
to
expand
its
storage
facilities
and
pipelines,
$105
million,
some
such
amount.
in
order
to
get
the
underwriter's
counsel
to
go
along
with
it,
they
had
to
either
get
a
court
order
saying
this
michigan
statute
didn't
apply,
or
go
get
an
order
proving
these
securities.
so
we
go
over
to
the
commission.
we
file
a
nice
routine
application,
and
while
this
is
going
on,
this
wholly
unrelated
construction
approved
by
ferc,
financing
approved
by
ferc,
nothing
to
do
with
the
divestiture
fight
that's
going
on
over
here
about
who
gets
which
assets.
so
what
does
the
commission
do?
it
holds
hostage
the
storage
application.
and
you'll
find--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--that's
correct,
and
i'm
also
saying
that
we're
not
speculating
about
it
because
this
club
in
the
closet...
to
use
a
phrase
in
the
reply
brief...
has
been
taken
out
of
the
closet
and
we
still
feel
the
bruises
from
it.
so
this
is
not
a
hypothetical
case
i'm
talking
about,
it
is
facial.
the
statute
is
wrong
on
its
face
as
applied
to
this
company.
i'm
saying
that
this
example
they
give
of
how
wonderful
it
was
for
michigan
proves
the
point
that
they
use
it
for
unrelated
purposes,
they
hold
hostage
these
securities
necessary
to
finance
a
ferc
authorized
project,
and
they'll
hold
it
up
until
they
get
what
they
want.
you'll
find
that
the
record
stipulates
that
the
way
we
got
the
certificate
for
storage
was
by
settling
the
other
case.
and
november
24,
1981,
happens
to
be
the
date
we
made
our
deal
with
the
state
and
happens
to
be
the
date
that
they
let
this
security
out
of
hostage
and
approved
it.
it
was
part
of
that
deal
and
it
was
putting
leverage
on
us.
now,
let's
look
on
the
facial
part
of
this
statute
to
the
future.
we
have
a
stipulation
in
the
record
of
what
this
statute
means
to
michigan.
and
the
stipulation
at
record
page
60
says
that,
even
without
regulatory
authority
that
they
have
all
over
these
other
local
utilities,
the
michigan
commission
can
still
exert
influence
over
pipeline
and
storage
if
it
has
the
right
to
regulate
the
security
issuances.
they
can
still
exert
influence.
that's
what
this
is
about.
now,
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
they
have
in
mind
for
the
future.
and
in
their
brief
at
page
5,
note
3,
they
tell
you.
they
tell
you
that
what
they're
interested
in
here,
and
why
they
want
this
statute,
and
bear
in
mind
the
club
in
the
closet
routine,--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--it
seems
to
me
it's
an
argument
when
they
say,
oh,
this
is
facial
and
you're
speculating
and
we
come
and
petition
this
court
because
they're
just
speculating
about
things
to
tell
you
not
only
what
they
did
with
this
statute,
but
what
they
plan
to
do
with
it.
and
this
is
what
they
say
in
their
brief.
they
want
this
statute
because
it
provides
an
opportunity
for
the
michigan
commission
to
assure
that
anr
does
not
violate
the
divestiture
settlements.
now,
the
divestiture
settlements
they're
talking
about
are
the
same
settlements...
and
i
was
going
to
say,
blackjacked
out
of
us...
but
i'll
honor
the
nomenclature
they
now
use...
these
are
the
same
settlements
they
clubbed
out
of
us
before,
and
how
instead
of
enforcing
those
settlements
which
are
agreements,
actual
signed
agreements,
instead
of
enforcing
those
agreements
the
old
fashioned
way
by
going
to
court
to
sue
on
the
contract,
they
want
this
club
to
hit
us
over
the
head
to
make
sure
we
honor
whatever
interpretation
they
want
to
place
on
it.
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
it's
the
only
use
they
have
for
it.
but
they've
got
so
used
to
using
it
on
us,
they
want
to
keep
it.
now,
that's
not
a
legitimate
use.
and
i
agree
with
everything
that's
said
that
these
examples
are
not
necessary.
maybe
we
showed
the
wounds
too
badly
but
with
or
without
these
examples,
past
and
future,
this
is
a
plain
flat
out
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
now,
we
cited
not
only
the
1925
cases
but
the
case
last
year
in
brown-forman
and
there's
a
two-tiered
test
and
this
doesn't
make
it
past
tier
one.
because,
as
the
court
said,
it's
a
violation,
you
can't
require
a
company
to
seek
regulatory
approval
in
one
state
before
undertaking
a
transaction
in
another.
you
can't
make
us
go
to
michigan
to
get
approval
to
finance
securities
to
build
something
in
the
gulf.
it's
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
and
although
there's
only
one
state
doing
this
now,
what's
to
stop
wisconsin,
if
this
court
says
this
is
grand
for
michigan,
why
shouldn't
wisconsin
do
it.
they've
got
as
much
interest.
milwaukee's
almost
as
big
as
detroit.
they've
got
almost
as
much
interest.
why
invite
them
to
have
a
races
to
vie
with
each
other
as
to
how
much
they
can
extract
from
anr?
what's
the
point
of
that?
now,
it's
really
unnecessary
in
our
view
under
the
commerce
clause
to
get
to
the
second
balancing
test,
but
if
you
were
to
get
there
and
the
court
below
is
correct,
what
interest
do
they
have?
they
cite
in
their
reply
brief
from
the
michigan
supreme
court
saying
that
securities
regulation
serves
the
interest
of
the
rate
payers
in
assuring
continued
service
and
in
receiving
that
service
at
reasonable
rates.
the
rates
are
just
and
reasonable
as
fixed
by
the
ferc.
they
can't
discontinue
service
without
going
to
the
ferc.
storage
doesn't
even
handle
gas
that's
burned
in
michigan.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
so
far.
next
is.
we
have
raised
both
points.
the
court
below
agreed
on
both
points.
but
as
to
the
commerce
clause,
we
think
there's
no
interest.
as
i
said,
the
over
capitalization
theme
which
the
michigan
courts
and
counsel
stress,
that
cannot
happen
under
ferc
regulations,
and
interests
of
investors
is
totally
taken
care
of.
so
the
commerce
clause
test
and
the
so-called
preemption
test
really
somewhat
overlap
in
this
area
because
of
the
history.
it
was
so
clear
from
the
missouri
v.
kansas
gas
and
related
decisions
that
in
1938
by
the
time
congress
go
around
to
breaking
its
silence,
it
was
so
clear
that
the
states
could
not
interfere,
the
power
of
regulation
could
not
reach
these
kind
of
companies,
that
congress
came
in
and
they
occupied
the
field.
this
is
not
a
preemption
case
like
rice
v.
santa
fe
elevator
where
the
states
had
long
been
traditionally
regulating
grain
elevators
since
mond
v.
illinois.
all
of
a
sudden
congress
comes
in
in
that
case
with
a
non-comprehensive
statute,
warehouse
act,
and
the
question
is
whether
they
had
preempted
longstanding
state
regulation.
this
is
not
what
this
is
about
at
all.
the
purpose
of
this
statute,
as
this
court
has
said
a
dozen
times,
is
to
occupy
the
field
in
which
the
supreme
court
has
held
the
states
may
not
act.
and
that's
clearly
this
company
and
this
field
and
this
activity.
and
having
occupied
the
field,
having
decided
to
in
that
comprehensive
regulation
instead
of
just
delegating
it
to
the
states
and
staying
silent,
its
all
occupied
by
the
ferc
authority.
now,
this
preissuance
approval,
as
i
said,
is
just
one
regulatory
tool
of
many.
and
when
the
statute
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
fpc
proposal,
had
been
narrowed
down
to
whether
the
ferc
should
be
given
this
added
power,
the
focusing
on
that
issue,
the
parties
came
in,
the
industry
came
in
and
said,
who
needs
it.
they
don't
need
it.
they've
got
plenty.
they've
got
certification,
they've
got
regulation
of
rates,
they've
got
the
accounting.
who
needs
it.
and
congress
didn't
act.
it
was
perfectly
obvious
they
weren't
persuaded
that
ferc
needed
this
additional
power.
but
whether
they
thought
they
did
or
not,
congress
had
occupied
the
field
that
this
court
had
said
the
states
could
not
enter.
the
court
had
drawn
a
bright
line
as
the
court
has
put
it.
congress
occupied
the
field
from
a
bright
line
that
the
states
couldn't
occupy
and
congress
occupied
this
field
and
therefore
it's
preempted.
now,
bear
in
mind
while
this
is
a
facial
attack
on
this
statute,
it
has
no
affect,
no
affect
on
the
application
of
this
statute
to
the
local
distribution
companies
as
to
which
the
states
always
could
act.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
it
only
applies
to
this
one
state
and
applies
to
anr
which
doesn't
to
any
end
user
business
in
michigan
and
is
about
as
clear
and
clean
and
purely
exclusively
an
interstate
company
as
you'll
ever
find.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
that's
a
difficult
question
to
answer,
justice
white,
in
this
sense.
when
you
start
dealing
with--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--yeah.
i
think
the
way
you
do
it
is
the
way
you've
done
it
in
a
dozen
cases.
is
you
go
into
the
history
of
the
federal
power
act,
the
natural
gas
act,
and
you
say
here
were
the
constitutional
decisions
that
led
to
that
act,
here
was
the
line
that
was
drawn,
here's
the
field
they
covered,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yeah,
when
they
occupied
the
field.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it's
a
supremacy
clause
argument.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
think
the
logic
is
you
get
to
that
first,
although
when
you
get
into
the
commerce
clause
history
to
show--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--i
wouldn't
feel
that
you'd
be
obliged
to
at
all,
no.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i'm
tempted
to
answer
that
in
a
more
flip
way
than
i
ought
to,
but
i
won't.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
correct.
i
think
the
logic
is
that
you
deal
with
the
history
of
this.
you
get
into
the
fact
that
congress
did
act,
and
i
think
that's
the
end
of
it.
i
know
there's
a
lot
of
controversy
about
commerce
clause
cases,
and
you
don't
have
to
really
decide
this
as
though
congress
had
not
acted,
because
congress
has
acted.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
all
i'm
saying
is,
it
violates
the
commerce
clause
if
there'd
never
been
a
natural
gas
act.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
surely
our
position.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
if
i
have
to
take
a
choice,
i
think
i'd
write
the
opinion
dealing
with
the
legislation
first,
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
thank
you.
