mr.
trienens,
you
argue
both
preemption
and
the
commerce
clause.
which
one
should
we
approach
first?
justice
white
well,
we're
going
to
have
to...
i
suppose
we'll
have
to
make
up
our
mind
as
to
which
one
to
deal
with
first?
justice
white
is
what
you
call
a
preemption
argument,
is
that
it?
justice
white
i
suppose
at
bottom
that's
a
constitutional
issue?
justice
white
but
sometimes
it's
called
sort
of
a
statutory?
justice
white
well,
what
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
that?
should
we
deal
with
the
other?
justice
white
well,
which
point
would
you
like
us
to
agree
with
you
on?
justice
white
either
one,
i
suppose,
yeah.
you
want
to
win.
justice
white
so
you
don't
think
there's
any
real
inconsistency
in
saying,
of
course,
this
is
not
preempted
but
it
violates
the
commerce
clause?
justice
white
well,
then
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
on
preemption
that
congress
never
intended
to
preempt
this
kind
of
thing,
but
nevertheless,
it
violates
the
commerce
clause,
a
dormant
commerce
clause?
justice
white
well,
you
haven't
answered
my
question,
yet,
i
guess.
