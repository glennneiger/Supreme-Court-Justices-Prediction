justice
scalia
actually
the
state
does
not
impose
this
what
you
describe
as
securities
regulation
on
any
companies
except
rate
regulated
companies,
though,
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
you
refer
to
it
as
securities
regulation,
but
it's
not
a
general
securities
law
that
applies
to
all
companies.
justice
scalia
so
the
answer
to
my
question
is?
justice
scalia
it
is
imposed
only
on
rate
regulated
public
utilities,
certain
rate
regulated
public
utilities?
justice
scalia
so
why
don't
we
call
it
public
utility
regulation
instead
of
security
regulation?
justice
scalia
does
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
for
example,
do
anything
of
this
sort--
justice
scalia
--it
doesn't
police
the
dead
equity
ratio
of
companies,
does
it?
justice
scalia
well,
any
interstate
pipeline
that
goes
into
michigan
is
the
life
blood
to
michigan,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
so
you're
asserting
that
that
gives
michigan
authority
to
regulate,
you
certainly
wouldn't
assert
that
gives
michigan
the
authority
to
regulate
all
interstate
pipelines
just
because
they're
essential
to
michigan?
justice
scalia
what
happens,
mr.
keskey,
if
the
state
does
not
allow
a
particular
issuance
of
debt
securities?
it
says
that
the
company
would
be
over
leveraged
if
this
particular
new
facility
should
be
financed
by
debt,
so
the
company
sells
new
stock
on
the
market.
when
it
comes
around
to
rate
making
by
ferc,
ferc
decides
that
indeed
the
company
has
too
much
equity
and
should
be
drawing
down
more
of
its
capital
on
the
debt
market
which
comes
at
a
lower
rate
and
will
give
lower
rates
to
consumers.
what
does
the
company
do?
and
therefore
ferc
disallows,
disallows
the
return
on
the
equity
investment
which
the
state
required
the
company
to
go
into
instead
of
debt.
what
happens
in
the
event
of
that
conflict?
how
is
the
company
supposed
to,
which
of
the
two
masters
does
the
company
obey?
the
state
says
you
have
to
do
it
by
equity,
rather
than
debt,
and
ferc
says,
well,
we're
sorry,
you
have
too
much
equity,
and
we're
not
going
to
allow
you
any
rate
of
return
on
this
equity,
you
should
have
done
this
by
debt.
justice
scalia
i
don't
care
what
michigan
looks
at.
i'm
just
saying,
this
is
what
happened
for
whatever
reasons,
michigan
did
it.
michigan
says
you
cannot
issue
debt
securities
for
this,
you
have
to
do
it
by
stock.
and
ferc
says
we
think
you
should
have
been
in
debt
equities
instead
at
a
lower
rate
of
return,
of
course,
and
therefore,
we're
not
going
to
allow
you
the
normal
rate
of
return
on
equity
securities?
justice
scalia
well,
they
always
do
when
they
make
rates.
justice
scalia
they
only
allow
return
on
justifiable
equity.
justice
scalia
i've
read
a
lot
of
rate
cases
where
the
rate
making
agency
has
disallowed
return
on
equity
because
the
agency
said
there
shouldn't
be
that
much
equity.
justice
scalia
that's
not
uncommon
at
all,
is
it?
justice
scalia
well,
what
would
happen
here?
is
your
position
that
michigan
would
have
to
yield
as
to
what
its
decision
concerning
the
proper
action
of
the
company
should
be?
would
michigan
have
to
yield
or
would
the
company
simply
have
to
obey
michigan
and
get
a
lower
rate
of
return?
justice
scalia
assume
the
reasons
most
favorable
to
michigan.
justice
scalia
i
consider
that
pretty
direct
when
you're
dealing
with
a
company
whose
business
is
to
collect
rates
not
to
allow
you
to
collect
any
rates
on
a
particular
issuance.
you
consider
that
very
indirect?
i
consider
that
a
fairly
direct
sanction
on
the
company.
mr.
keskey,
can
i
ask
you
a
little
more
about
the
notion
of
issuing
debt
for
an
unlawful
purpose,
you
suggested
buying
a
baseball
team
or
something
like
that.
what
would
make
it
unlawful
for
one
of
these
companies
to
buy
a
baseball
team?
justice
scalia
--did
you
have
to
use
it
against
anr?
couldn't
you
have
gotten
the
same
information
by
using
it
just
against
michcon?
justice
scalia
weren't
michcon
securities
involved?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
why
you
couldn't
do
it
through
your
regulation
of
michcon.
justice
scalia
interstate
gas
companies,
was
your
answer
meant
to
say
33
states
are
regulating
interstate
gas
companies?
justice
scalia
thank
you.
justice
scalia
did
they
ever
in
fact
alter
the
proposed
manner
of
financing?
justice
scalia
mr.
trienens,
any
legitimate
state
authority
can
be
abused.
i
mean
your
companies
surely
have
to
get
construction
permits
to
building
buildings
or
to
connect
telephone
lines
or
whatever.
they're
are
innumerable
ways
in
which
the
state
can
hold
up
your
company
if
it
wants
to.
but
that
isn't
an
argument
against
the
validity
of
those
state
authorities.
