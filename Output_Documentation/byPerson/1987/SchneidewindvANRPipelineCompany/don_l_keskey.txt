mr.
don
l.
keskey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
review
of
two
major
holdings
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit.
the
first
that
michigan
act
144,
which
regulates
the
securities
of
utilities
and
natural
gas
companies,
is
implicitly
preempted
by
the
natural
gas
act
because
congress
had
the
purpose
to
deregulate
securities
of
natural
gas
companies.
secondly,
for
the
opposite
purpose
that
ferc
was
sufficiently
regulating
securities
under
its
section
7
certificate
powers
and
thirdly
because
of
what
the
court
viewed
as
an
imminent
possibility
of
conflict
between
michigan
act
144
securities
regulation
and
the
natural
gas
act.
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
michigan
act
144
represented
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce
on
all
tests,
the
per
se
of
discrimination
test,
the
balancing
test
of
pike
v.
bruce
church
and
also
on
the
basis
of
a
need
for
national
uniformity
with
respect
to
securities
regulation
of
natural
gas
companies.
in
reaching
these
holdings,
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
failed
to
follow
this
court's
preemption
test,
and
failed
to
follow
congressional
intent
in
the
natural
gas
act.
congress,
in
the
natural
gas
act,
did
not
occupy
the
whole
field
of
natural
gas
regulation,
it
did
not
speak
to
securities
regulation
whatsoever,
it
did
not
preempt
the
states
from
regulating
securities
by
its
silence
in
the
nga
regarding
this
subject.
this
court
has
held
extensively
in
panhandle
eastern
that
the
purpose
of
the
nga
was
to
close
regulatory
gaps
brought
about
by
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
in
a
specific
area,
interstate
transportation
of
gas
and
sales
for
resales.
it
did
not
involve
the
area
of
securities
regulation
of
natural
gas
companies.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
the
purpose
of
the
michigan
statutes
is
to
protect
the
public
interest,
the
public
health
safety
and
welfare.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
one
of
the
major
purposes
is
to
ensure
that
the
extensive
pipeline
facilities
and
storage
facilities,
the
property
located
within
the
state
does
not
become
over
collateralized,
the
company
doesn't
become
over
capitalized
so
that
the
maintenance
and
the
safety
and
environmental
concerns
regarding
those
facilities
are
not
harmed.
secondly,
that
there
is
reliable
service
to
the
public.
in
large
part,
these
are
still
monopoly
companies,
or
at
least
oligopolies.
the
service
of
natural
gas
the
captive
markets
substantial
markets
in
michigan
are
very
integral
to
the
livelihood,
the
existence
of
the
people
in
michigan
and
to
the
economic
development
of
the
state.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
it
can
protect
the
rate
payers
by
ensuring
that
over
capitalization
does
not
result,
to
ensure
that
there
are
not
abuses
in
financings.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
no.
it's
not
designed
to
regulate
rates
or
interstate
rates.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
the
state
court
indicates
that's
one
of
the
purposes.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
no,
no,
not
whatsoever.
by
protecting
against
financing
abuses,
and
by
protecting
against
over
collateralization,
you
can
ensure
that
service
will
be
available
at
reasonable
rates,
that
you
will
not
get
financing
that
will
eventually
end
up
being
a
burden
on
the
company
and
would
eventually
harm
service
to
michigan
at
reasonable
rates.
it's
not
an
attempt
to
address
rate
making
because
we
recognize
fully
that
that
is
a
function
of
ferc,
and
we
intervene
in
rate
cases
at
ferc,
but
it
is
to
ensure
that
there
is
not
an
affect
from
financing
actions
which
results
in
damage
to
the
financial
viability
of
both
the
natural
gas
assets
and
to
the
companies
themselves.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
it
applies
to
public
utilities
and
to
natural
gas
companies,
or
interstate
electric
companies.
under
the
federal
power
act
204,
congress
expressly
recognized
that
states
could
continue
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
regulation
with
respect
to
interstate
electric
companies.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
that
this?
mr.
don
l.
keskey
essentially
public
utility
type
companies
upon
which
there's
a
heavy
dependence
by
the
public
on
these
companies
or
a
monopoly
type
companies,
strong
nexus
of
public
interest
to
these
companies.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
it's
really
the
same
thing,
or
they're
extremely
closely
related.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
acts
which
involve
registration
and
the
filing
of
information.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
no,
it
does
not.
and
it
does
not
look
at
the
key
which
act
144
does,
and
that
is
what
is
the
relationship
between
the
capital
and
the
value
of
the
assets
on
the
balance
sheet
and
the
good
will
of
the
business.
neither
ferc
nor
the
sec
look
at
that.
are
these
securities
being
issued
for
a
lawful
purpose,
have
they
had
their
board
resolutions
passed,
do
they
have
their
stockholders
approve
this,
is
it
in
accordance
with
the
indenturers,
are
these
companies
going
to
engage
in
something
like
buy
a
baseball
team
or
are
they
going
to
involve
themselves
in
some
illegal
securities
transactions.
because
if
they
do,
and
they
try
to
shift
that
onto
the
company
it
could
come
back
to
haunt.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
it's
really
pretty
much
dealing
with
the
problem
before
the
fact.
in
other
words,
ferc
looks
at
rates
and
entirely
it's
an
after
the
fact
approach.
the
obligations
of
the
company
are
already
issued
and
they're
already
binding.
but
this
is
a
peek
at
looking
at
the
obligations
before
they're
issued,
before
they
become
permanently
binding
on
the
company
to
see
is
this
lawful,
is
this
in
the
public
interest,
will
michigan
be
protected.
these
companies
have
such
an
important
relationship
to
michigan.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
it
is
to
every
public
utility
that
operates
in
the
state
of
michigan,
including
electric,
gas,
telephone
companies.
it
also
applies
to
interstate
electric
companies
and
the
interstate
gas
companies
who
have
more
than
five
percent
of
their
revenues
generated
in
the
state
of
michigan.
although
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
is
a
facial
attack
on
the
statute.
we
did
have
stipulated
facts
regarding
these
particular
respondents
who
have
40
percent
of
michigan's
natural
gas
requirements
are
provided
by
these
companies,
50
percent
of
their
sales.
the
anr
storage
company
has
all
of
its
property
located
in
michigan.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
the
state
governments
were
involved
in
extensive
public
utility
regulation
prior
to
any
federal
acts.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
yes.
michigan's
act
was
enacted
in
1909
and
it
was
applied
to
natural
gas
companies
in
1929,
which
predated
the
nga.
and
numerous
other
states,
even
at
the
time
of
the--
mr.
don
l.
keskey
--one
of
the
respondents
happens
to
be
a
michigan
corporation,
but
the
important
thing
here
is
the
substance
of
their
relationship
to
michigan
and
the
substantial
presence
and
importance
to
michigan,
not
specific--
mr.
don
l.
keskey
--that
is
an
additional
item
that
does
matter,
but
the
primary
thing
we're
looking
at
here
besides
the
corporation
filing
requirements
and
the
regulation
as
a
michigan
corporation
is
the
substantial
context
and
important
nexus
of
these
companies
to
michigan's
public
interest.
and
just
the
fact
that
they
are
a
michigan
corporation,
and
one
of
them's
a
delaware
corporation,
but
it
has
no
context
with
delaware
whatsoever.
they're
business
is
substantially
in
michigan
and
they
are
the
life
blood
to
michigan,
and
so
on
that
basis,
it's
an
additional
basis.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
to
certain
segments
or
portions
of
michigan,
that's
correct.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
we're
not
trying
to
regulate
any
federal
area,
such
as
rates,
transportation,
sales
for
resale.
we're
looking
at
the
power
that
michigan
had
before
the
nga
to
regulate
the
securities
based
upon
their
presence
in
the
state.
they
are
collateralizing
michigan's
property
whenever
they
issue
long
term
securities.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
michigan's
review
primarily
looks
at
the
relationship
of
the
overall
capital
compared
to
the
overall
value
of
the
property
and
the
business.
that's
where
over
capitalization
comes
in.
it's
not
the
capital
ratio,
which
you're
talking
about.
that's
very
indirect.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
i
would
presume
in
that
situation
that
the
company
would
go
to
the
commission
and
present
the
rate
decision
of
ferc
which
you're
giving
me
an
example
of
ferc
providing
a
hypothetical
requiring
a
hypothetical
capital
structure.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
very
rarely.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
hypothetical
capital
structures
in
the
rate
regulation
business
is
very
rare.
most
witnesses
in
rate
cases
will
testify
as
to
what
the
appropriate
ratios
are
of
equity
to
debt,
and
most
companies,
almost
all
companies
that
are
utilities
in
the
united
states
are
within
those
reasonable
ranges.
now,
if
a
company
has
more
common
equity
than
debt,
the
cost
of
common
equity
is
normally
higher,
but
the
business
risk
is
lower,
and
the
economists
will
testify
that
the
more
equity
you
have,
the
lower
cost
you
assign
to
it,
because
of
this
reflection
of
less
business
risk.
so
you're
on
a
teeter
totter
in
a
sense
that
if
you
have
more
and
more
equity,
usually
the
economists
in
a
rate
case
will
assign
lower
and
lower
costs
to
that
common
equity
so
that
it
approaches
debt.
now,
you've
given
me
an
example
which
first
of
all
hypothetical
capital
structure
is
extremely
rare.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
that's
correct.
it
occurs.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
in
terms
of
percentage
of
cases,
it's
rare.
it
does
occur.
and
in
that
instance,
the
company
between
rate
cases,
which
is
usually
an
extensive
period
of
time,
would
either
not
get
rate
reflection
for
it,
or
would
make
adjustments
in
its
financial
structure
to
accommodate
that.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
it's
extremely
difficult
in
a
hypothetical
and
we're
dealing
here
with
a
hypothetical
that
hasn't
happened
in
the
78
years
that
the
michigan
act
has
been
in
effect.
to
imagine
all
of
the
factual
possibilities
of
how
you
would
get
to
this,
and
those
are
important
because
there
could
be
any
of
number
of
reasons
why
michigan
would
act
the
way
it
did,
and
the
way
ferc
acted
the
way
it
did.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
there
is
a
theoretical
possibility
that
michigan...
and
it's
most
theoretical...
that
michigan
could
require
that
no
more
debt
be
issued
because
the
company
was
over
capitalized
or
because
it
was
issuing
debts
for
an
unlawful
purpose,
and
ferc
would
have
required
them
indirectly...
not
directly,
indirectly...
by
not
reflecting
full
rates
for
common
equity,
let's
say,
that
there
is
this
situation.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
it's
not
necessarily
that
sitting
here
in
this
hypothetical
and
the
facts
presented
it
would
be
unlawful.
but
this
statute
allows
michigan
to
obtain
information
as
to
what
is
happening
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
unlawful,
and
those
would
be
based
upon
the
arguments
in
the
contested
case.
in
other
words--
mr.
don
l.
keskey
--in
part.
this
helps
michigan
obtain
information.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
i
think
the
best
way
to
answer
it
is
to
give
you
an
example
of
how
michigan
used
this
statute
to
protect
its
local
interests
without
affecting
any
interests
that
are
national
or
involve
interstate
commerce.
and
that
is
not
a
hypothetical
but
an
actual
case.
in
1981,
anr,
the
parent
company,
owned
michigan
consolidated
gas,
which
was
a
local
utility.
the
michigan
public
service
commission,
throughout
its
existence
and
in
more
recent
years,
has
promoted
in
michigan
the
development
of
vast
natural
gas
storage
fields
which
are
huge
caverns
thousands
of
feet
below
where
the
gas
can
be
stored
in
natural
sea
beds.
it
provided
recognition
of
that
in
rates
and
encouraged
it
through
help
with
the
local
engineers
and
so
forth,
with
the
property
owners,
etcetera.
many
of
these
fields
were
developed
and
michcon
had
its
transmission
lines
to
these
wholly-in-state
facilities,
and
michcon
had
its
lines
between
one
part
of
its
service
area
in
detroit
and
another
part
of
its
service
territory
in
northern
michigan.
and
anr
came
up
with
a
proposal
to
divest
michcon
from
its
system.
but
it
wasn't
going
to
just
divest
michcon.
it
was
going
to
take
for
itself
all
of
these
storage
facilities
that
the
michigan
ratepayer
had
paid
for
and
had
developed.
it
was
going
to
take
all
of
these
transmission
lines
that
connected
the
company
together
so
that
michcon
would
be
left
as
an
orphan
on
the
doorstep
of
the
michigan
public
service
commission
as
only
a
distribution
utility
with
no
ability
to
transport
gas
within
the
state
to
these
storage
facilities
and
to
the
rest
of
its
service
territory.
it
would
have
to
pay
anr
for
that
right.
it
would
have
to
pay
anr
to
pay
for
the
ability
to
transport
gas
to
the
rest
of
its
company
on
facilities
that
it
built
itself,
and
that
michigan
encouraged
and
that
michigan
rate
payers
paid
for.
and
these
storage
facilities
and
these
lines
were
not
necessary
to
anr's
interstate
system.
and
if
the
storage
was
usable
for
any
interstate
purposes,
michcon
was
ready
to
lease
those
facilities
its
capacity
to
those
interstate
companies.
in
fact,
does
so
now
with
anr.
so
we
used
the
statute
because
people
were
walking
around
saying,
what's
happening,
we
can't
get
any
information.
what's
happening
is
the
fact
that
the
parent
company
is
going
to
strip
our
utility
of
all
the
assets
that
are
valuable
and
leave
everything
that's
not
valuable
on
the
backs
of
the
michigan
public.
now,
we
used
this
statute
to
start
a
proceeding
to
get
information.
that
was
the
only
way
we
could
get
information.
ferc
had
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever
because
this
involved
no
construction.
this
involved
a
situation
of
financing
transactions
among
anr
and
michcon
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
ferc's
powers,
nothing
to
do
with
a
section
7
certificate
which
is
the
only
area
where
even
respondents
arguably
say
that
michigan
and
ferc
both
look
at
financing.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
no,
because
anr
was
the
one
that
had
planned
the
entire
transaction,
anr
was
engaging
in
these
securities,
anr
controlled
michcon.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
michcon
securities
were
involved,
anr
securities
were
involved,
and
even
a
third
holding
company
that--
mr.
don
l.
keskey
--well,
that's
an
actual
case
which
is
not
here.
we
don't
have
an
actual
case.
if
we
did,
we
would
have
the
advantage
of
citing
to
you
the
record.
but
the
situation
was,
it
came
down
to
the
fact
that
this
was
the
statute
that
permitted
michigan
to
get
information
to
find
out
what
was
happening
to
protect
the
dismemberment
of
a
public
utility
that
serves
millions
of
customers
in
michigan
and
is
integral
to
the
very
economy
of
michigan.
and
we
did
so.
we
reached
a
settlement.
both
sides
were
accommodated.
the
anr
system
was
not
harmed.
there
were
no
national
interests
involved.
there
was
no
ferc
jurisdiction
involved
in
terms
of
the
securities,
and
there
didn't
have
to
be.
they
didn't
have
to
get
approval
from
ferc
to
do
this.
we
preserved
the
michigan
utility
as
an
entity,
and
by
doing
so,
we
saved
costs,
we
saved
rates.
the
cost
of
that
company
to
the
customers
would
be
much
higher
today
if
they
would
have
been
stripped.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
yes.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
all
of
its
other
contexts
are
with
michigan
except
for
the
fact
that
they
have
chosen
to--
mr.
don
l.
keskey
--its
customers
are
all
outside
of
michigan,
that's
correct.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
that's
correct.
but--
mr.
don
l.
keskey
--the
storage
company
has
these
vast
facilities
in
northern
michigan
which
have
to
be
adequately
maintained,
they
have
to
be
adequately
engineered,
you
can
only
put
a
certain
amount
of
gas
in
these
facilities,
otherwise
you
can
damage
the
cap
rock,
and
have
tremendously
dangerous
blowouts.
or
you
could
destroy
the
facility
as
a
viable
storage
facility.
if
you
become
under
capitalized
or
if
you
over
leverage
those
facilities,
and
you
are
not
capable
of
maintaining
these
facilities
properly,
it's
very
dangerous.
further,
the
gas
customers
that
the
storage
company
has
are
located--
mr.
don
l.
keskey
--yes.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
well,
the
michigan
commission
does
get
involved
in
safety
by
assisting
ferc
as
the
eyes
and
ears
of
ferc
with
respect
to
safety
requirements.
but
we're
looking
at
a
way
to
prevent
over
capitalizations
or
the
assets
being
over
collateralized
so
that
they
would
be
neglected.
but
there's
another
purpose,
also,
and
that
is
that
in
the
gas
business,
interstate
transportation,
when
it
goes
from
storage
to
customers,
let's
say
in
montana,
is
done
by
displacement.
so
what
occurs
is
that
this
gas
is
stored
in
the
center
of
michigan,
the
storage
company
transports
it
to
24
miles
to
an
interstate
pipeline
which
does
the
transportation.
storage
has
no
interstate
transportation,
it
doesn't
sell
any
gas.
it
doesn't
have
any
transportation
tariffs
to
be
approved
by
ferc.
gas
molecules
actually
are
used
in
michigan.
they
are
part
of
the
reliability
of
supply
in
michigan,
but
the
storage
company
delivers
it
to
michigan
located
interstate
transportation
which
sells
the
molecules
in
michigan.
and
on
the
other
end
of
its
system
in
montana,
it
gives
an
accounting
credit
to
that
person
over
there,
and
gives
them
the
molecules
over
there.
so
theoretically
and
conceptually,
yes,
there's
interstate
transportation
if
you
go
right
from
the
beginning,
right
to
montana.
but
it
isn't
done
by
anr
storage.
it's
done
by
an
interstate
company
that
ferc
does
regulate
in
terms
of
interstate
rates.
storage
company's
wholly
in
michigan,
the
gas
properties
are
in
michigan.
it
does
have
an
importance
to
supply
even
in
michigan
because
the
displacement
is
basically
an
accounting
type
exchange.
and
so
if
there's
a
failure
of
those
facilities,
it
will
affect
michigan
not
only
in
the
viability
of
the
facilities,
but
with
respect
to
supply
applications
in
michigan.
so
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
we
have
a
vast
area
of
regulation
over
here
and
over
here.
the
respondents
have
said
there's
potential
conflict,
only
a
possibility
of
conflict
in
this
narrow
area
about
section
7
certificates.
we
see
there
isn't.
but
why
deregulate
securities
with
respect
to
all
the
rest
of
this
area
when
there
has
been
no
actual
conflict.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
about
any
actual
conflict
in
the
50
years
that
the
nga
and
the
act
has
survived
together.
this
is
a
facial
attack,
and
congress
did
not
occupy
the
field
of
securities
regulation
it
intended
the
states
to
continue
to
do
so.
and
it's
not
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
because
we
are
focusing
totally
on
michigan's
interests.
there
is
no
discriminatory
intent
or
effect
in
this
statute.
it
never
was
passed
for
an
economic
protectionist
purpose.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
yes.
montana
does,
california
has
a
statute
which
permits
it.
at
the
time
of
the
1950
hearings,
33
states
were
regulating
natural
gas
companies'
securities.
we
don't
know
how
many
other
than
california
and
montana
are.
but
the
states
are
regulating
the
interstate
electric
companies,
and
congress
provided
for
that
in
federal
power
act
204.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
yes.
in
1950,
33
states,
and
we
have
it
in
a
footnote
about
legislative
history
in
our
brief,
33
states
were
regulating
the
securities
in
natural
gas
companies
operating
interstate
commerce.
mr.
don
l.
keskey
your
honor,
this
is
a
facial
attack.
there
has
been
no
problem
with
michigan's
act.
we
are
at
a
disadvantage
to
argue
from
a
record
that
doesn't
exist
with
respect
to
either
interstate
commerce
or
preemption.
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
respondents.
we
have
no
record.
secondly,
look
at
rice
v.
santa
fe
elevator.
that
takes
care
of
your
honor's
rate
question
because
in
that
we
have
an
analogous
situation
where
this
court
preserved
the
securities
regulation
even
though
the
federal
government
took
over
all
other
aspects
including
rates.
and
it
found
the
purposes
that
the
state
could
continue.
interstate
commerce,
there's
no
discriminatory
affect,
no
discriminatory
purpose.
the
congress
itself
has
recognized
that
uniformity's
not
necessary
with
securities
regulation
over
interstate
utilities.
it
has
done
so
in
federal
power
act
204.
how
are
you
going
to
distinguish
in
any
rational
sense
interstate
natural
gas
companies
from
interstate
electric
companies
when
those
two
acts
grew
out
of
the
same
purpose,
the
same
history.
and
this
court
has
interchangeably
interpreted
both
acts.
congress
when
it
passed
the
natural
gas
act
displayed
a
willingness
to
allow
the
states
to
regulate
securities
because
it
provided
for
no
preemption.
you
don't
have
preemption
by
silence.
and
congress
recognized
that
the
states
could
regulate
securities,
uniformity
was
not
required.
