justice
o'connor
mr.
keskey,
what
is
the
purpose
exactly
of
the
michigan
state
statutes
in
this
regard?
justice
o'connor
be
a
little
more
specific.
that
doesn't
tell
me
much.
justice
o'connor
is
it
intended
at
all
to
make
available
gas
to
michigan
consumers
at
reasonable
rates?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
an
effect
on
rates
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
legislation?
justice
o'connor
did
your
state
court
ever
find
that
one
of
the
purposes
was
to
ensure
reasonable
utility
rates?
justice
o'connor
but
you
disavow
that
as
a
purpose?
justice
o'connor
mr.
keskey,
you
also
assert
jurisdiction
to
regulate
the
respondent's
storage
company,
do
you
not?
justice
o'connor
and
that
has
no
customers
at
all
in
michigan,
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
well,
aren't
its
suppliers
and
customers
all
outside
of
michigan?
justice
o'connor
and
suppliers?
all
that's
in
michigan
is
their
physical
facilities,
plant
and
equipment,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
and
what
is
the
interest
of
michigan
there
then
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
you
mean,
you're
talking
about
some
physical
accident
that
might
occur
and
injure
people?
justice
o'connor
and
you
can't
directly
require
safety
standards
for
employees?
justice
o'connor
does
any
other
state
regulate
presently
the
securities
issued
by
natural
gas
companies,
mr.
keskey?
justice
o'connor
will
ferc
condition
the
granting
of
the
certificate
on
the
issuance
of
certain
types
and
amounts
of
securities?
justice
o'connor
would
it
be
concerned
only
with
the
construction
of
facilities
for
the
transportation
of
gas,
rather
than
some
unrelated
business
that
the
holding
company
might
be
going
into?
i
mean,
ferc
wouldn't
get
into
that
in
terms
of
securities?
justice
o'connor
or
any
other
legitimate
business
activity
that
the
company
might
be
engaged
in.
justice
o'connor
well,
don't
talk
baseball.
there
may
be
some
other
unrelated
business,
and
it
does
seem
to
me
the
state
might
have
the
only
regulatory
power
in
terms
of
securities
issuance
to
finance
some
other
sort
of
business,
other
than
the
immediate
project
for
the
gas
certificate.
