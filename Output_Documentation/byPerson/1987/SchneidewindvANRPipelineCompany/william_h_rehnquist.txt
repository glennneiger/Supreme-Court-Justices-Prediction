chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
no.
86-986,
eric
schneiderwind
versus
anr
pipeline
company.
mr.
keskey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
there's
constitutional
doctrine,
isn't
there,
that
a
company
is
entitled,
constitutionally
entitled
to
a
reasonable
return
on
its
investments,
and
the
state
probably
has
an
interest
in
looking
at
what
those
investments
are.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
limitation
on
the
companies
on
which
this
is
applied?
i
mean,
is
it
to
every
public
utility
that
is
doing
business
in
michigan
or
is
there
some
domicile
requirement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
keskey.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
trienens.
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly
some
of
the
corporate
interrelationships
in
the
days
of
samuel
insull
and
so
forth
caused
concern
among
lots
of
people.
it
wasn't
just
buying
a
baseball
team,
but
it
was
the
loan
structure
and
debt
structure
from
the
parent
to
the
subsidiary.
i
don't
think
that's
an
unreasonable
concern
on
the
part
of
the
state.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you
were
doing
it
in
the
state,
you'd
be
subject
to
the
state
blue
sky
laws
in
any
case,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
your
timing
argument,
you
know,
it
frustrates
the
company's
best
interest,
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
state
can't
do
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
is
a
facial
attack,
isn't
it,
mr.
trienens.
i
mean,
it
isn't
what
might
have
happened
in
a
particular
situation.
you're
saying
the
statute
is
just
unconstitutional
however
michigan
applies
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
is
a
commerce
clause
argument,
not
a
preemption
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
trienens.
mr.
keskey,
you
have
one
minute
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
keskey.
the
case
is
submitted.
