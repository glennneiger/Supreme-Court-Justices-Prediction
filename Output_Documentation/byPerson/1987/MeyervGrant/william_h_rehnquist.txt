chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-920,
natalie
meyer
v.
paul
k.
grant.
mr.
knaizer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
knaizer,
was
there
some
basis
for
the
legislature
singling
out
petitions
that
were
circulated
by
people
who
were
hired
to
do
it
as
opposed
to
volunteers?
were
they
considered
to
be
a
greater
cause
of
this
evil
of
not
being
sure
that
you've
got
registered
voters
to
sign
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
described
the
problem
as
being
the
fact
that
the
circulators
did
not
really
pay
any
attention
to
who
was
signing.
did
the
legislature
focus
in
some
way
on
the
fact
that
they
thought
paid
circulators
were
more
guilty
of
this
type
of
activity
than
unpaid?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
a
paid
elector
has
to
meet...
a
paid
circulator
has
to
meet
that
requirement,
too,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
you
say
in
this
particular
case
the
abused
did
result
from
the
activities
of
paid
circulators?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
problem
of
my
own
experience
in
that
sort
of
work
is
not
that
a
lot
of
people
from
new
york
would
sign
this
petition
in
colorado,
but
that
a
circulator
is
going
to
open
up
the
phone
book
and
just
write
a
bunch
of
names
and
addresses
out
of
the
phone
book
in
kin
do
phony
handwriting
that
nobody...
that
no
one
ever
signed.
now
is
that
part
of
the
evil?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
had
raised
my
eyebrows.
i
wasn't
necessarily
going
to
ask
a
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
again,
my
own
experience
is
that
a
lot
of
the
trucking
industry
wouldn't
have
been
at
all
happy
with
the
deregulation.
that
some
of
the
people
who
wanted
to
get
into
the
industry
would,
and
the
people
who
are
already
there
generally
like
it
regulated.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
knaizer.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
danks.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
your
position
was
that
it
was
designed
to
prevent
fraud.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
a
circular
just
goes
out
and
offers
$2.00
to
everyone
who
will
sign
if
you
are
a
registered
voter
and
otherwise
qualified,
can
the
state
prohibit
the
offering
of
money
for
perfectly
good
signatures?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
presumably
if
they
sign,
they
are
doing
whatever
the
state
says
they
should
do
to
have
the
issue
on
the
ballot,
but
they
are
also
getting
two
bucks
for
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
state
could
prohibit
the
payment
of
money
to
people
as
a
consideration
for
their
signing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
danks.
mr.
knaizer,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
knaizer.
the
case
is
submitted.
