mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
state
of
colorado
may
prohibit
payment
to
persons
who
are
circulating
petitions
to
get
an
initiative
measure
on
the
ballot
so
long
as
it
does
not
otherwise
prohibit
payment
or
otherwise
limit
the
amount
of
money
which
proponents
may
spend.
the
purpose
of
the
initiative
in
colorado
is
to
provide
an
alternative
means
through
which
the
popular
will
may
be
expressed.
it
is
an
addition
to
the
already
existing
right
to
petition
the
government.
it
is
not
a
limit
on
the
right,
but
in
fact
extensive
inherently.
it
provides
a
means
by
which
the
public
may
pass,
actually
pass
legislation
when
the
legislature,
because
of
the
influence
of
special
interests,
has
ignored
the
public
will.
the
initiative
provisions
provided
for
in
the
state
constitution
and
by
colorado
statute
are
designed
to
ensure
that
the
initiative
remains
a
true
alternative
through
which
the
collective
will
may
be
expressed,
and
to
ensure
that
the
integrity
of
the
process
remains
in
tact.
in
order
to
secure
the
purposes,
the
people
of
the
state
of
colorado,
through
both
its
constitute
and
its
statutes,
have
set
forth
procedures
which
must
be
followed
before
a
petition
can
get
access
to
the
ballot.
the
petition
circulator
in
this
process
plays
an
absolutely
crucial
role
which
is
in
part
set
forth
by
the
constitution.
he
is
not
only
the
person
who
circulates
the
petition,
but
by
constitutional
provision
he
is
also
the
one
who
transforms
the
petition
into
prima
facie
evidence
that
the
signatures
on
the
petition
are
in
fact
true
and
correct,
and
that
the
signatories
are
also
registered
electors
of
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
to
be
a
petition
circulator?
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
well,
the
only
qualification
that
he
needs
is
to
be
a
registered
elector
which
in
colorado
means
that
he
must
be
a
resident
of
the
state
of
colorado,
and
actually
registered
to
vote.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
if
he
is
a
registered
elector,
then
even
if
he
is
a
convicted
felon,
yes,
he
can
be
permitted
to
conduct
the
petition
circulation.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
if
he
is
allowed
to
vote.
i
believe
under
colorado
law
that
if
you
are
convicted,
you
may
not
be
allowed
to
vote,
but,
frankly,
i
am
not
sure
of
that.
but
if
he
is
allowed
to
vote
and
if
he
is
registered,
yes,
indeed,
he
can
do
that.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
that
is
correct.
there
is
a
forgery
provision
in
the
state
statutes.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
every
person
signing
the
initiative
must
be
a
registered
voter;
that
is
correct.
i
think
there
is
one
important
point
here.
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
not
necessarily
just
one
of
prohibiting
forgery.
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
genesis
of
this
particular
statute
wasn't
the
fact
that
it
was
forgery.
it
was
the
fact
that
it
was
difficult
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
people
who
were
signing
the
petitions
were
in
fact
qualified
people.
what
had
happened
historically
was
that,
at
least
between
1910
and
1941,
was
that
colorado
had
no
prohibition
on
petition
circulators,
that
is,
paying
them.
in
the
late
'30s,
though,
it
became
apparent
that
there
were
some
abuses
which
occurred.
and
basically
what
happened
was
that
petition
circulators,
in
order
to
enhance
the
income
that
they
were
to
obtain
from
the
circulation
process,
started
to
allow
the
petitions
to
circulate
without
actually
observing
the
signatures
being
made.
in
fact,
those
facts
were
outlined
in
the
case
of
brownlow
v.
wunsch
which
we
had
cited
in
our
brief.
so
the
legislature
felt
that
the
process
was
itself
being
undermined
by
the
fact
that
nobody
really
knew
who
was
signing.
it
wasn't
necessarily
just
a
question
of
forgery.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
yes,
the
voters
who
are
signing
the
petition
don't
have
to
sign
an
affidavit.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
the
petition
circulator
must--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--it
would
be
a
criminal
offense
to
falsely
swear,
that
is
true.
i
would
like
to
add,
though,
that
the
criminal
offense
may
not
be
enough
in
this
case
to
satisfy
the
particular
problem.
as
this
court
noted
in
buckley
v.
valeo
when
it
was
discussing
the
question
of
whether
or
not
criminal
sanctions
were
sufficient
with
regard
to
contributions,
the
court
noted
that
only
in
blatant
sorts
of
cases
would
the
criminal
offenses
be
sufficient.
there
was
some
concern
expressed
by
the
court
in
buckley
about
a
prophylactic
sort
of
measure
in
certain
instances
to
avoid
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
corruption,
and
we
believe
that's
what
has
occurred
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
there
were,
but
the
courts
have
fairly
frequently
repealed,
or
not
repealed,
but
declared
the
statutes
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
i
believe
washington
may.
nebraska
did
until
about
a
month
ago,
and
for
the
last
three
or
four
years
those
have
really
been
the
only
states
which
have
had
the
prohibition.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
that's
right.
it
was
deregulating
the
transportation
industry
in
general.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
the
election
has
long
since
passed,
that
is
correct.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
oh,
the
deregulation.
no,
it
has
not.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
well,
no.
in
our
view,
it
is
not,
because
in
colorado
this
question
arises
every
general
election.
it
arises
every
two
years.
so,
for
example,
in
colorado
now
there
are
two
or
three
measures
which
people
are
trying
to
get
on
the
ballot.
and
so
for
us
it's
an
issue
that
comes
up
every
two
years,
and
we
feel
it's
the
sort
of
issue
that
is
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
yes.
as
i
understand
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative...
the
prohibition
was
designed
specifically
to
take
care
of
a
problem
which
in
fact
existed.
as
i
had
mentioned
in
the
case--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--there
was
no
legislative
history
that
i
could
find
at
the
time.
the
only
connection
that
we
could
make
was
between
that
case
of
brownlow
v.
wunsch,
which
outlined
the
facts,
and
the
fact
that
in
the
next
legislative
session
the
legislature
prohibited
paid
petition
circulators.
in
that
brownlow
v.
wunsch
case,
the
supreme
court
made
specific
mention
of
the
potential
abuses
that
could
occur
because
of
paid
petition
circulators.
the
court
itself
singled
it
out,
and
in
the
next
legislative
session,
and
in
that
time
it
was
held
biannually,
the
court
took
care
of
the
problem
by
singling
out
paid
petition
circulators.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
well,
the
abuses
that
were--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--okay.
the
abuses
were
essentially...
well,
let
me
back
up
a
little
bit.
one
of
the
concerns
that
colorado
has
is
that
there
be
a
significant
modicum
of
support
for
each
measure.
and,
of
course,
that
is
determined
by
the
number
of
signatures
that
you
get.
and
so
if
the
measure
is
circulated,
you
really
don't,
and
the
petition
circulator
is
not
there
to
observe,
you
really
don't
have
an
idea
if
the
people
are
reading
the
provision,
have
read
the
provision,
understand
it.
there
also
is
the
possibility
of
fraud
but,
frankly,
that
wasn't...
as
far
as
i
could
tell
in
brownlow
v.
wunsch,
that
was
not
an
issue
in
that
case.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
there
has
been
no
indication
at
least
in
colorado
that
it
was
true.
can
it
happen?
yes,
it
can
happen.
to
our
knowledge,
it
hasn't
occurred,
at
least
in
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
well,
i
would
think
that
the
opposite
in
fact
may
be
true,
because
the
volunteer,
at
least
conceived
under
the
colorado
law,
really
has
an
interest
in
getting
the
measure
on
the
ballot,
and
wants
to
make
sure
the
measure
stays
on
the
ballot.
so
he
would
have
more
of
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
the
process
is
handled
correctly
so
that
his
measure
can
ultimately
succeed.
whereas
the
paid
circulator
is
really
just
interested
in
getting
the
money,
and
perhaps
maybe
hopeful
that
he
doesn't
get
caught
by
padding
the
petitions.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the
last
part.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
it's
really
both.
there
is
a
growing
industry
where
firms
are
actually
paid
to
circulate
petitions.
in
fact,
in
california,
it's
my
understanding
that
it's
a
multi-million
dollar
industry.
however,
there
are
circumstances
such
as
existed
in
this
case
where
basically
it
is
people
who
want
to
take
a
day
off,
or
want
to
pay
somebody
to
substitute
for
them.
so
you
really
do
get
a
combination
of
both.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
no,
if
the
daughter
was
a
registered
elector--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--that
would
violate
the
statute.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
well,
really
what
that
is
geared
to
is
the--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--well,
there
was...
i
believe
in
that
same
brownlow
v.
wunsch
case,
there
was
an...
well,
that
was
before--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--but
there
hasn't
been
any
case
that
interpreted
that
particular
statute.
but
the
whole
purpose
is
to
make
sure
that
the
person
who
is
signing
his
name
is
the
one
who
he
purports
to--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--right.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
no,
our
belief
is
that
sending
your
daughter
out
would
violate
the
statute.
you
are
really
supposed
to
witness
the
signature.
the
earlier
cases
of
brownlow
v.
wunsch
did
say
that
if
you
actually
recognize
the
signature,
you
could...
that
would
be
satisfactory.
but
i
think
the
passage
of
this
statute
takes
care
of
that.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
the
practice
has
been
to
require
the
petition
circulator
to
actually
observe
the
signing
of
the
petition.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
well,
that
is
the
way
the
secretary
has
interpreted
it
over
the
years.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
no,
in
fact--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--one,
but
not
interpreting
this
particular
provision.
there
was
a
case
of
urevich
v.
woodard
which
addressed
the
question
of
the
word
"inducement"
in
that
statute.
and
in
that
particular
case,
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
that
the
term
"inducement"
was
overbroad
and
therefore
declared
that
portion
of
the
statute
unconstitutional.
the
rest
of
it
remained.
and
to
my
knowledge,
that
is
the
only
reported
case
involving
the
statute,
either
criminal,
or
declaratory,
or
otherwise.
let
me
just
address
briefly
the
issue
of
why
a
registered
elector
is
necessary.
the
registered
elector,
as
i
said,
is
both
the
person
who
is
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
colorado
and
registered
to
vote.
that
provision
was
put
in
there
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
colorado
in
1980.
it
used
to
be
that
there
was...
that
the
only
person
who
could
circulate
the
petition
was
a
qualified
elector.
a
qualified
elector
was
just
basically
a
resident
of
the
state
who
in
fact
may
or
may
not
want
to
vote,
and
may
or
may
not
have
been
registered.
the
people
of
the
state
of
colorado,
in
the
constitution
in
1980,
determined
that
they
wanted
to
basically
upgrade
the
position
of
the
petition
circulator
by
making
him
a
registered
elector.
and
our
belief
is
that
they
did
that
because
they
really
wanted
to
establish
not
only
ties
to
the
community,
but
also
ties
to
the
election
process.
they
really
believed
that
it
was
important
that
the
registered
elector
be
a
person
who
was
a
believer
and
actually
tied
into--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--a
paid
circulator
has
to
meet
that
requirement.
but
the
problem
with
the
paid
circulator
is
that
there
is
an
inducement...
there
is
basically
another
god,
if
you
will,
another
boss.
he
is
a
representative,
that
is,
the
petition
circulator
is
a
representative
of
the
people,
but
he
is
also,
in
essence,
an
employee
of
the
person
who
is
paying
him.
and
we
believe
that
under
those
circumstances
you
end
up
with
a
situation
where
the
person...
when
you
end
up
creating
an
appearance
of
corruption,
or
at
least
an
appearance
of
undue
influence.
the
purpose
of
the
petition-circulator
is
to
verify
signatures.
that's
set
out
in
the
constitution
itself.
by
paying
him
at
that
point,
you
perhaps
give
people
the
impression
that
he
may
not
be
concentrating
on
his
job
of
verifying
signatures,
but
may
in
fact
be
adding
signatures
in
order
to
increase
the
income
he
could
have
from
the
circulation
of
the
petition.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
in
colorado,
you
can't
do
that.
you
cannot
be
paid
period.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
no,
he
is
not...
in
nebraska,
for
instance,--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--couldn't
get
bus
fare
either,
that's
correct.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
i'm
not
sure
it's
as
black
and
white
as
that.
but
basically--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--well,
the
experience
in
colorado
was
in
fact
that
paid
petition
circulators
weren't
as
careful
about
the
collection
of
signatures.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
no,
there
was
evidence...
there
was
an
evidence
of
fraud.
there
was
evidence
that
in
fact
the
petition
circulators
had
not
properly
circulated
petitions.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
there
was
evidence
that...
well,
there
was
no
evidence
regarding
the
fiery-eyed
zealots.
there
was
evidence
regarding
the
paid
petition
circulators.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
well,
as
far
as
the
legislature
knew
everybody
wasn't
careless.
the
paid
petition
circulators
were
more
so.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
there
wasn't
evidence
that
when
the
proponent
obtained
it,
they
were
all
okay.
but
there
was
evidence
that
the
process
was
more
abused
by
the
paid
petition
circulators.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
there
wasn't
any
that
was
in
that
case.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
that's
correct.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
that's
correct.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
the
abuse
did
result
from
the
activities
of
paid
circulators;
that
is
correct.
basically
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
that
what
is
regulated
is
in
fact
conduct.
the
paid
petition
circulator
is
the
verifier
of
the
signatures.
that
is
conduct.
it
is
not
speech.
it
is
true
that
petition
circulators
can
advocate.
they
are
not
prohibited
from
advocating.
the
only
thing
that
they
cannot
do
is
tie
in
their
advocacy
to
payment
for
circulating
the
petitions
themselves.
so
we
believe
that
really
all
there
is
is
conduct
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
okay.
in
village
of
schaumburg
and
munson,
for
example,
the
two
cases
that
come
to
mind,
in
those
cases
there
were
absolute
prohibitions.
for
example--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--that's
correct.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
if
you
look
at
it
in
that
context,
that's
correct.
but
i
think
what
you
are
really
looking
at
here
is...
you
have
to
look
at
it
in
the
election
context
itself.
this
person
is
performing
a
function,
really
a
quasi-public
function
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
colorado,
and
the
people
of
the
state
of
colorado
in
the
sense
that
he
is
verifying
signatures.
it's
really
no
different
in
that
particular
sense
from
an
election
judge
who
signs
you
in
when
you
in
fact
go
into
vote.
so
in
that
sense,
it's
conduct.
i
think
what
the
election
judge
is
doing
when
he
signs
you
in
is
conduct,
and
what
is
happening
with
the
petition
circulator,
at
least
with
regard
to
the
verification
of
the
petitions,
is
also
conduct.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
speech--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--the
people
in
colorado
can
expend
money
in
any
fashion
to
bring
that
message
to
the
voters.
the
amount
of
money
is
unlimited,
and
the
types
of
things
that
you
can
spend
the
money
on--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--the
people
who
circulate
the
petitions
can't
speak,
they
cannot
be
paid.
it
is
true
that
the
people
in
this
case
want
to
pay
the
petitioners.
however,
the
people
of
the
state
of
colorado,
in
passing
the
constitutional
amendment
regarding
initiative,
said
that
the
petition
circulator
has
to
be
the
verifier.
it
is
the
general
will
of
the
people
that
the
verification
process
becomes
the
primary
function.
now
the
proponents
of
a
particular
election
can
choose
to
mesh
the
two.
but
if
there
is
a
conflict,
then
the
primary
function
set
out
by
the
statute
is
in
fact
the
one
that
has
to
take
precedence.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
he
just
takes
the
word
of
the
registered
elector.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
well,
the
elector
also
has
certain
other
functions
other
than
to
verify
that
it's
a
registered
elector.
he
has
to
verify
in
fact
that
the
person
who
signs
the
petition
is
the
one
who...
is
the
one
who
actually
signed
it;
that
is,
nobody
sign
for
him.
so
there
are
more
functions.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
nobody
verifies
that
he's
a
voter.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
that's
part
of
the
evil.
i
can
tell
you
that
that
was
a
fact
that
was
found
by
the
courts,
but
in
fact
i
think
that's
part
of
the
concern.
that's
a
more
blatant
aspect
of
it,
but
it
definitely
is
part
of
the
concern.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
there
are
forgery
statutes
which
makes
it
a
classified
felony
for
the...
yes,
a
classified
felony,
that's
correct.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
well,
i
think
it's
an
underlying
argument.
we
weren't
trying
to
say
that
money
wasn't
a
part
of
the
process,
or
could
not
be
a
part
of
the
process.
however,
we
didn't
want
money
to
reach
the
point
where
it
overwhelmed
the
entire
purpose
of
the
initiative
in
the
first
place.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
it
depends
on
the
issue.
sometimes
in
colorado
the
experience
has
been
that
in
fact
money
interests
don't
get
what
they
want
from
the
legislature,
and
attempt
to
influence
the
process
by
flooding
the
political
market.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
in
this
case,
there
weren't
monied
interests.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
as
far
as
we
could
tell.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
i'm
just
speaking
from
the
record.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
and
i
have
to
admit
from
the
record
that
we
couldn't
tell.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
i'm
sorry?
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
well,
actually
it
was
the
corporate
side,
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
libertarian
party,
something
called
coloradans
for
free
enterprise.
if
you
are
asking
me
to
speak
from
the
record,
there
wasn't
any
indication
in
the
record
that
there
was
a
lot
of
money
involved,
but
certainly
i
think
the
surmise
is
correct
that
the
trucking
industry,
at
least
in
part,
would
have
been
happy
with
the
deregulation
of
the
industry.
i'd
like
to
reserve...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
okay.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
i
would
just
like
to
make
a
brief
comment.
i
think
when
reviewing
this
case,
we
would
like
the
court
to
understand
and
to
review
what
the
initiative
process
really
is,
and
the
fact
that
the
whole
process
and
the
way
it
was
designed
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
colorado
has
to
provide
for
additional
public
discourse.
and
xx
people
of
the
state
of
colorado,
through
its
legislature,
believed
that
this
prohibition
is
designed
to
provide
exactly
that;
it's
a
narrowly
drawn
prohibition
that
was
designed
to
attack
one
problem,
the
problem
that
in
fact
existed
in
the
legislature's
eyes,
and
that
is
all
that
is
prohibited.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
fraud
is--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
that.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
fraud
is
in
as
an
underlying
purpose.
i
do
agree
with
mr.
danks
that
there
was
a
statement
made
at
the
hearing
in
the
district
court
that
fraud
was
not
an
issue.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out,
though,
that
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
judge
moore's
opinion,
he
indicated
a
concern
for
the
integrity
of
the
process
because
of
padding
of
petitions,
and
there
was
a
statement
in
the
case
regarding
padding
of
petitions
by
the
expert
for
the
state
of--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--not
necessarily,
and
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
let
me
see
if
i
can
make
the
distinction
again.
the
petitioner
circulator
may...
may
i
answer
the
question?
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
the
petition
circulator
may
be
in
a
position
where
he
decides
to
pass
the
petition
around.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
and
he
doesn't
see
who
signs
it.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
he
is
supposed
to
witness--
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
--well,
that
is
fraud,
but
i
was
talking
about
the
signature
of
the
electors
themselves.
mr.
maurice
g.
knaizer
thank
you.
