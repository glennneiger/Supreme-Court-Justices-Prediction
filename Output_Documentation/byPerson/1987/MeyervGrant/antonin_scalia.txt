justice
scalia
what
qualifications
does
he
have
to
have
under
state
law?
justice
scalia
right,
for
that
august
function?
justice
scalia
can
he
be
a
convicted
felon?
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
it's
more
likely
to
happen.
it
seems
to
me
the
legislature's
judgment
is
absolutely
counter-intuitive.
let's
assume
i
am
running
a
business,
petition
circulators,
and
i
get
paid
for
circulating
petitions
and
getting
signatures.
don't
you
think
that
i
would
be
much
more
concerned
about
having
my
petition
thrown
off
the
ballot
because
of
too
many
signatures
that
weren't
valid
than
would,
you
know,
innumerable
volunteers
who
just
go
around
and
get
signatures?
i
would
think
that
there
is
a
market
incentive
for
the
paid
circulator
to
be
sure
that
he's
getting
proper
signatures.
and
what
incentive
is
there
for
the
volunteer?
justice
scalia
you
think
he
doesn't
care
if
it's
grown
out?
it
seems
unlike
to
me.
justice
scalia
it
seems
unlikely
to
me
that
a
paid
circulator
would
not
care.
do
you
know
whether
these
paid...
are
there
any
businesses
of
paid
petition
circulators,
or
is
it
the
case
that
most
of
the
paid
circulators
are
people
who
in
fact
favor
the
measure
but
they
just
can't
afford
to
take
a
day
off
from
their
jobs?
so
the
organization
that
furthers
the
measure
says,
you
know,
we
have
some
funds
and
we'll
pay
you
half
of
what
your
salary
is
if
you
take
the
day
off
to
circulate
on
behalf
of
the
cause.
justice
scalia
whereas
you
do
have
an
impartial
adjudicator
of
the
petitions
if
the
person
is
not
being
paid,
but
is
a
zealous,
fiery-eyed
proponent
of
the
legislation
that
is
being
proposed.
that
poses
no
problem.
only
money
can
corrupt;
not
ideology,
is
that
the
theory
of
the
legislature?
justice
scalia
is
it
even
gray?
i
mean,
why
does
one
think
that
there
is
any
less
incentive
on
the
part
of
someone
who
is
being
paid
to
get
a
certain
number
of
valid
petitions?
he
is
certainly
not
being
paid
to
get
invalid
petitions.
why
would
he
have
less
incentive
than
the
zealous
advocate
of
the
measure
on
the
ballot?
justice
scalia
i
thought
you
said
before
there
was
no
evidence
as
to--
justice
scalia
--was
there
evidence
that
they
were
more
careless
than
the
fire-eyed
zealots
were?
justice
scalia
that
they
were
careless,
but
then
everybody
may
have
been
careless
as
far
as
the
legislature
knew.
justice
scalia
why
was
not
everybody
careless?
why
did
the
legislature
know
that?
was
there
evidence
that
when
the
proponent
of
the
measure
himself
gets
the
signatures
there,
they
are
all
okay?
justice
scalia
when
you
say
more,
there
was
evidence
that
it
was
abused.
what
evidence
was
there
that
it
was
more
abused?
you
can't
establish
that
it
was
more
abused
without
knowing
either
that
it
was
not
at
all
abused,
or
that
it
was
less
abused
by
others.
was
there
any
such
evidence?
i
thought
you
said
there
wasn't.
justice
scalia
so
the
only
evidence
really
was
that
it
was
abused.
justice
scalia
and
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
any
more
abused
by
the
paid
circulators
or
not.
justice
scalia
mr.
knaizer,
i
am
frankly
not
bowled
over
by
the
more
significant
danger
of
the
paid
circulator
as
opposed
to
the
volunteer
circulator,
but
you
made
another
argument
in
your
brief
which
was
that
the
initiative
after
all
is
a
device
that
was
a
product
of
the
populist
era,
and
it
was
directed
against
monied
interest
and
it's
contrary
to
the
whole
spirit
of
the
thing
to
have
the
monied
interests
running
the
initiative.
you
have
dropped
that
argument,
or
do
you
still
think
it's
a--
justice
scalia
--don't
the
monied
interests
do
better
in
the
legislature
than
they
do
in
the...
you
know,
i
mean
don't
the
money
interest
have
full-time
lobbyists
at
the
legislature
and
isn't
it
better
to
be
able
to
use
a
little
bit
of
money
to
counteract
that
through
an
initiative?
justice
scalia
where
were
the
monied
interests
in
this
case?
justice
scalia
there
weren't?
justice
scalia
the
trucking
industry
that's
regulated
in
the
state
was
sort
of
neutral
on
this?
it
didn't
care
whether
entry
was
open
or
not.
justice
scalia
oh,
i
see.
justice
scalia
what
was
the
group
that
was
circulating
the
petition?
it
was
the
libertarian
party?
justice
scalia
was
it
libertarian
party?
justice
scalia
mr.
danks,
do
you
pay
them
by
the
signature?
justice
scalia
mr.
danks,
i
am
a
little
concerned
about
your
response
to
justice
o'connor's
last
question.
i
sort
of
find
it
surprising
that
a
man
who
is
here
on
behalf
of
a
group
that
wanted
to
deregulate
trucking
favors,
or
says
it's
perfectly
okay
to
regulate
petition
circulation.
i
mean
you
understand
what
will
happen
if
you
require
petition
circulators
to
be
licensed
and
to
undergo
training
courses
as
you
say,
and
so
forth.
it
will
be
more
expensive
to
hire
petition
circulators,
just
as
i
assume
you
said
to
the
voters
of
colorado,
it
was
more
expensive
to
hire
truckers.
do
you
think
that's
perfectly
okay
to
have
petitioner
circulators
licensed
the
way
you
have
a
real
estate
broker's
license,
or
a
barber's
license
or
something
like
that?
you
are
sure
that
is
all
right
as
far
as
you
are
concerned.
justice
scalia
your
group
will
be
spending
a
lot
more
money.
justice
scalia
that's
fine.
i
just
hope
you
are
not
inviting
an
opinion
that
says
it's
okay
because
you
could
license
petition
circulators
after
all.
justice
scalia
mr.
danks,
is
there
any
reason
why
you
think
this
same
issue
is
going
to
arise
between
you
and
the
state
in
the
future?
justice
scalia
you
mean
by
pursuing
it,
undertake
another
initiative?
justice
scalia
mr.
danks,
i'm
sorry
to
come
back
to
this,
but
it's
a
point
that's
very
important
to
me.
i
am
afraid
it's
really
not
enough
for
me
that
it's
within
the
realm
of
possibility
that
one
of
these
plaintiffs
might
be
involved
in
another
initiative.
do
you
think
it's
probable,
likely
that
any
of
them
would?
isn't
one
of
the
individual
plaintiffs
an
officer
in
the
libertarian
party?
justice
scalia
at
that
time.
