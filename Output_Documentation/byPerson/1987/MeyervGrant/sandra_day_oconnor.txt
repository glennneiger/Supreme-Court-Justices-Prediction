justice
o'connor
mr.
knaizer,
there
is,
i
take
it,
a
state
law
in
colorado
prohibiting
and
making
a
criminal
offense
the
use
of
forged
signatures
on
these
initiative
measures?
justice
o'connor
and
there
is
a
requirement
that
every
person
signing
the
initiative
measure
must
be
a
qualified
voter?
justice
o'connor
does
the
form
of
the
initiative
circulation
require
the
circulator
to
verify
under
oath
that
everyone
signed
in
his
presence?
justice
o'connor
no,
but
the
petition
circulator
has
to.
justice
o'connor
and
it
would
be
a
criminal
offense
to
falsely
swear
that
people
had
signed
in
the
circulator's
presence
if
that
were
not
the
case.
justice
o'connor
are
there
any
other
states
that
have
this
particular
provision
prohibiting
the
use
of
paid
circulators?
justice
o'connor
do
you
know
of
any
other
state
presently
that
makes
use
of
the
initiative
which
has
such
a
law?
justice
o'connor
the
election
in
question
here,
the
initiative
measure
was
for
a
constitutional
amendment
having
to
do
with
removal
of
motor
carriers
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
public
service
commission?
justice
o'connor
and
the
election
has
long
since
passed.
justice
o'connor
has
that
provision
ever
been
enacted,
the
change,
the
proposed
change?
justice
o'connor
and
is
it
still
an
issue?
the
case
is
not
moot,
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
they
also
have
to
express
the
point
of
view
of
the
people
seeking
the
change
particularly
to
get
a
signature
on
an
initiative.
isn't
speech
required
in
a
very
core
area
of
first
amendment
protection
here?
justice
o'connor
political
issues,
and
issues
of
public
concern,
and
what's
at
stake
here
is
whether
the
person
putting
this
measure,
proposing
to
put
it
on
the
ballot
can
expend
money
to
have
that
message
carried
to
the
voters?
justice
o'connor
well,
they
want
to
spend
it
on
paying
people
to
offer
to
voters
the
petitions.
justice
o'connor
but
there
are
forgery
statutes
out
there
making
it
what,
a
felony?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
danks,
do
you
concede
that
there
is
a
valid
state
interest
in
regulating
the
conduct
of
petition
circulators?
justice
o'connor
and
the
purposes
that
the
state
is
urging.
do
you
concede
that
that
is...
those
interests
are
valid
state
interests?
justice
o'connor
and
if
there
were
some
regulation
to
the
effect
that
you
couldn't
pay
them
by
the
number
of
signatures
obtained,
would
you
say
that
might
be
valid?
justice
o'connor
could
the
state
require
paid
petition
circulators
to
be
licensed?
