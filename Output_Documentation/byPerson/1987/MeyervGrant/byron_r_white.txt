justice
white
well,
what
about
the
fund
raising
cases?
how
about
the
charity
drives?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
cases...
the
cases
don't
say
that
because
the
circulator
or
the
fund
raiser
not
only
advocates
but
takes
money,
that
he
isn't
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
white
taking
the
money
is
like
getting
the
signature,
isn't
it?
conduct.
justice
white
well,
you
may
not
accept
yourself
the
notion
that
pay
encourages
a
violation
of
the
law,
but
let's
assume
that
the
legislature
thought
that
it
did.
they
found
that
there
was
this
problem.
we
don't
have
to
disagree
with
the
legislature
to
rule
for
you,
do
we?
justice
white
well,
but
even
if
there
is
a
problem
like
the
legislature
identified,
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
lose
the
case.
that
just
means
the
speech
interest
overrides
the
interest
the
legislature
identified.
justice
white
mr.
danks,
may
the
state
forbid
paying
people
to
sign?
justice
white
you
go
around,
a
person
collecting
signatures
goes
around
and
is
in
the
neighborhood,
and
acquaints
a
person
with
what
the
issue
is,
and
says,
by
the
way,
$5.00
if
you
sign.
justice
white
well,
is
it
legal
for
the
state
to
forbid
that?
justice
white
well,
i
know
that
it
may
be,
but
i
just
wondered
if
it
would
be
constitutional
to
forbid
paying
a
person
to
sign.
justice
white
that's
the
whole
point.
i
thought
that
in
your
initial
presentation
you
said
fraud
wasn't...
perhaps
wasn't
as
important
as
something
else,
which
i
take
it
you
think
isn't
fraud,
if
you
paid
the--
justice
white
--yes,
you
may.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
you
say
that
he
is
supposed
to
witness
the
signatures.
justice
white
and
if
he
turns
in
his
certification
representing
that
he
did,
isn't
that
fraud?
justice
white
okay.
