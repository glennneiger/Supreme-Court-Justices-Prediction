mr.
william
c.
danks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
appear
before
you
today
representing
five
individuals
and
a
corporation.
my
brother
from
the
colorado
bar,
the
assistant
attorney
general,
appears
representing
two
state
elected
officials
there
is
a
certain
irony,
however,
though
in
our
respective
representations.
mr.
knaizer
appears
as
a
paid
advocate,
whereas
i,
more
by
circumstance
than
by
choice,
appears
as
an
unpaid
advocate.
[laughter]
i
trust
that
any
remarks
i
make
in
favor
of
paid
versus
unpaid
will
not
be
applied
to
my
situation.
in
this
case,
the
same
five
individuals
incorporation
which
have
sent
me
to
court
today
to
argue
before
the
highest
court
in
our
land,
and
try
to
convince
you
of
the
merit
of
their
cause,
also
wished
to
hire
advocates
to
go
on
the
streets
of
the
state
of
colorado
and
to
approach
registered
voters
with
their
petitions,
and
ask
these
registered
voters
if
they
would
sign
the
petition.
they
were
involved
in
a
basic
first
amendment
right,
the
right
of
free
speech,
and
they
were
talking
about
certain
fundamental
political
issues.
they
were
advocating
a
deregulation
of
the
motor
carrier
industry.
and
in
this
case,
i
submit
that
my
clients
were
a
grass
roots
campaign.
they
were
seeking
to
change
the
status
quo,
and
it
was
the
status
quo
that,
by
and
large,
was
opposed
by
the
trucking
industry;
not
entirely
though.
certain
trucking
companies,
for
example,
acme
delivery
service,
had
service
throughout
the
metropolitan
denver,
but
wished
to
have
statewide
authority.
certain
other
trucking
industries
wanted
to
be
free
from
price
regulation.
these
are
the
types
of
arguments
which
petition
advocates
would
go
before
the
voters
and
say,
these
are
the
reasons
why
we
wish
you
to
sign
our
petition;
and
they
would
engage
the
voter
in
a
dialogue.
and
it
was
often
a
painful
process.
to
approach
someone
cold
on
the
street
is
not
an
easy
task.
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
it's
a
difficult
task,
but
the
petitioner
circulator
who
does
this
for
several
hours,
and
is
turned
away,
often
without
even
given
the
chance
to
articulate
his
views,
gets
discouraged.
the
testimony
was
that
money
motivates
people
to
work.
and
while
the
volunteer
motivated,
money
can
also
motivate
someone.
and
in
order
for
my
clients,
the
five
individuals
in
the
corporation
to
get
this
issue
on
the
ballot,
they
had
to
obtain
some
46,000
plus
signatures.
those
five
individuals
couldn't
do
the
job
by
themselves.
they
either
had
to
get
someone
else
to
volunteer
their
time,
or
they
had
to
get
other
advocates
to
go
out
there.
now
the
question
has
been
raised,
is
there...
you
know,
is
there
a
split
between
a
volunteer
versus
a
paid.
is
it
completely
one
or
the
other.
i
would
submit
the
record
is
different,
that
you
get
a
combination
of
the
two
in
the
typical
campaign.
what
you
get
are
volunteers
that
are
interested
in
the
measure,
but
who
could
also
be
motivated
by
a
certain
amount
of
compensation,
and
money,
at
least
enough
to
make
it
worth
their
while
to
go
out
on
the
street
in
this
type
of
a
fashion.
mr.
william
c.
danks
were
we
going
to...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
we
hadn't
decided
whether
we
were
going
to
pay
them
by
the
signature
or
flat
rate.
the
statute,
though,
would
prevent
either
a
flat
rate
or
payment
based
upon
the
number
of
signatures.
and
a
statute
more
narrowly
drawn
to
cover
that
problem
might
state
that
payment
based
upon
productivity
or
the
number
of
signatures
would
be
prohibited,
but
this
statute
covers
both.
mr.
william
c.
danks
for
purposes
of
preventing
fraud?
i
think
that
there
are
other
state
statutes.
mr.
william
c.
danks
i
concede
that
there
is
a
valid
state
interest
in
having
petitions
that
do
not
contain
forged
signatures,
and
i
concede
that
there
is
a
valid
state
interest
in
having
a
modicum
of
support.
mr.
william
c.
danks
it
might
be
valid.
it
presents
a
different
or
more
difficult
question.
certainly
attorneys
or
other
advocates
are
paid
based
upon
productivity,
and
they
are
not
always
paid
strictly
on
an
hourly
basis,
and
our
system
rewards
productivity.
now
the
concept
of
paying
someone,
and
therefore
they
are
going
to
violate
the
law
because
they
are
paid,
i
don't
accept.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
someone
were
adequately
paid...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
better
paid
persons
are
probably
the
more
competent
and
more
careful
in
their
work.
mr.
william
c.
danks
i
believe
they
could.
they
could
go
through
training
sessions.
if
their
concern
was
really
to
make
sure
that
the
circulators
do
a
good
job,
they
could
be
more
careful
in
their
screening
of
the
types
of
individuals
that
are
selected
for
petition
circulators.
they
could
have
training
programs
and
more
of
an
educational
function.
mr.
william
c.
danks
justice
white,
you
wrote
on
that
point,
i
believe,
in
monroe.
and
i
would
consider
this
a
different
type
of
case.
i
don't
consider
this
a
ballot
access
case,
but
rather,
i
consider
this
a
free
speech
case.
mr.
william
c.
danks
i
believe
i
would
agree
that
they
have
to
show
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest,
and
that
they
have
a
heavy
burden
to
meet
that
this
is
the
most
exacting,
or
the
easiest
way
to
meet
their
problem.
i
might
also
point
out
that
this
issue
of
fraud
was
not
an
argument
that
was
raised
by
the
state
of
colorado
in
the
trial
court.
this
issue
of
fraud
specifically
was
denied
as
being
a
purpose
by
the
attorney
general
who
tried
the
case,
who
was
a
different
attorney
general
from
the
one
that
appears
before
you
today.
but
in
closing
arguments,
the
attorney
general
stated
as
follows
in
the
transcript
that
appears
at
page
111.
"the
plaintiffs
argue
that
the
only
arguable
state
interest
at
stake
in
this
case
is
to
prevent
fraud,
and
we
disagree.
"
"that
is
not
the
state
interest
that
we
ask
this
court
to
consider.
"
so
before
the
trial
court,
their
position
was
that
this
statute
was
not
designed
to
prevent
fraud.
mr.
william
c.
danks
well,
we
were
struggling
to
find
out
what
their
interest
was.
i
was
struggling.
if
you
read
the
closing
arguments,
the
closing
arguments
are
not
included
in
the
joint
appendix;
we
have
only
included
the
testimony.
but
in
the
closing
argument
there
was
a
dialogue
with
the
trial
court
as
to
what
is
the
state
interest.
and
i
was
struggling
to
figure
out
now
what
is
this.
they
keep
talking
about
the
integrity
of
the
process;
does
this
mean
fraud
or
what
does
it
means.
and
there
was
a
dialogue,
and
the
state
attorney
general
says
quite
flatly
that
they
are
not
trying
to
state
that
the
statutes
are
there
to
prevent
fraud.
mr.
william
c.
danks
i
see
the
point
you
are
raising.
mr.
william
c.
danks
all
right.
i
am
an
advocate,
and
i
am
attempting
to
have
this
statute
declared
unconstitutional.
and
from
my
perspective
today,
i
am
arguing
that
there
are
other
ways
to
get
at
these
problems.
if
one
of
the
problems
is
that
the
petition
circulator
is
not
well
trained,
then
perhaps
the
state
legislature
should
attack
that
problem
directly.
i
don't
know,
and
i
haven't
given
that
maybe
careful
enough
study,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
other
methods
to
attack
a
problem
directly.
in
my
mind,
there
is
no
correlation
between
being
paid
versus
unpaid
and
the
quality
of
the
petition
circulator.
my
argument
today
is
that
in
fact
a
paid
circulator
is
probably
going
to
be
a
better
circulator
than
the
unpaid
circulator.
mr.
william
c.
danks
no,
sir,
i
am
not.
mr.
william
c.
danks
they
argued
two
points.
they
would
talk
about
the
integrity
of
the
process.
and
i
had
difficulty
pinning
down
what
integrity
means.
in
essence,
i
believe
they
were
arguing
that
there
must
be
some
sort
of
a
grass
roots
campaign,
and
that
by
paying
petition
circulators
you
are
going
to
be
violating
that.
and
that
is
the
integrity
they
were
talking
about.
the
other
aspect
of
their
state
interest
was
that
they
felt
there
was
some
sort
of
correlation
between
the
number
of
volunteers
and
the
ultimate
success
on
the
merits,
and
this
goes
to
their
modicum
of
support.
somehow
that
if
you
have
sufficient
fiery-eyed
petition
circulators
to
go
out
and
gather
these
signatures,
then
probably
you
are
going
to
have
enough
votes
at
the
general
election
to
have
the
thing
passed.
those
were
the
two
arguments
that
were
raised
at
that
time.
and
regarding
the
modicum
of
support,
colorado,
of
course,
has
a
provision
in
the
constitution
that
requires
5
percent
of
the
electors
who
voted
in
the
last
secretary
of
state's
election
who
must
sign
this
petition.
so
we
are
talking
about,
in
our
case,
46,000
plus
signatures,
and
this
establishes
that
modicum
of
support.
i
would
submit
that
there
is
a
state
interest
in
making
sure
that
the
ballot
is
not
cluttered
with
issues
that
have
no
chance
of
passing.
but
this
interest
is
protected
by
having
a
5
percent
petition
signature
requirement.
mr.
william
c.
danks
well,
the
issue
of
deregulation
is
still
a
lively
topic
in
colorado.
the
motor
carrier
industry
is
gradually
being
deregulated;
household
goods
one
session;
another
session,
the
taxicab
drivers.
it
is
a
recurring
issue.
this
petition
drive
certainly
was
hurt
by
our
inability
to
pay
petition
circulators.
we
did
not
qualify
for
the
ballot.
but
there
is
certainly
an
interest
among
my
plaintiffs
to
pursue
this
matter,
and
in
fact
are
pursuing
this
matter.
mr.
william
c.
danks
yes,
that
is
within
the
realm
of
possibility.
i
am
not
saying
that
we
have
one
organization
that's
ready
to
go
tomorrow,
but
it's
certainly
one
of
the
methods
of
approach.
and
if
we
were
successful
in
this,
that
would
certainly
be
a
boost
to
us.
the
trouble
with
our
issue
is
it's
not
the
kind
of
issue
that
raises
emotions.
deregulation
of
motor
carriers,
while
it's
of
interest
to
me
and
it's
certainly
bothers
certain
small
businessmen
who
have
gone
and
applied
for
authority
and
have
been
turned
down,
while
they
can
get
excited
about
it,
the
general
public
does
not
get
excited
on
this
issue.
and
to
be
able
to
pay
petition
circulators
in
our
case
would
certainly
help
us
a
great
deal.
mr.
william
c.
danks
may
the
state--
mr.
william
c.
danks
--yes,
the
state
statute...
no,
you
can't
pay
someone
to--
mr.
william
c.
danks
--yes,
i'm
sure
that
it's
also
in
the
constitution,
although
now
that
you
ask--
mr.
william
c.
danks
--yes,
i
think...
in
other
words,
would
it
be
constitutional
under
the
first
amendment,
not
just
under
our
colorado
constitution?
well,
certainly
it
would,
because
the
state
can
have
an
interest
in
guaranteeing,
you
know,
5
percent
of
the
populace
support
this.
and
if
you
have
forged
signatures,
obviously
you
are
not
going
to
have
your
5
percent.
the
state
had
an
interest
in
preventing...
certainly
the
state
can
regulate
conduct
that
defeats
that
5
percent
modicum
of
support.
mr.
william
c.
danks
i
believe
it
can,
because
the
goal
is
to
have
5
percent
of
the
people
sign,
and
by
signing
they
are
stating
that
they
want
this
issue
on
the
ballot.
mr.
william
c.
danks
well,
they
may
be,
but
then
you
have
a
factual
issue
as
to
whether
they
signed
it
for
the
$2.00
or
in
order
to
get
it
on
to
the
ballot.
mr.
william
c.
danks
yes,
and
then
we
get
into
a
balancing
test
i
believe
as
well.
that's
a
direct
method
of
dealing
with
a
problem.
in
other
words,
a
prohibition
directly
against
paying
someone
to
sign
the
petition,
whereas
this
ia
a
very
indirect
method
in
which
we
are
somehow
saying
that
by
paying
someone
as
an
advocate
they
are
more
likely
to
go
that
extra
step
and
then
pay
the
person
for
actually
signing
the
petition.
it's
that
second
leap
that
i
am
arguing
is
not
proper;
that
the
statute
can
deal
with
the
problem
directly.
mr.
william
c.
danks
he
was
at
that
time.
mr.
william
c.
danks
nancy
bigbee,
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
is
a
transportation
lawyer,
and
that's
a
very
important
issue
to
her.
she
represents
clients
that
continually
are
going
before
the
public
utilities
commission.
and
i
can
represent
to
you
that
nancy
bigbee
would
be
interested
in...
as
a
probability
would
be
interested
in
going
forward
with
the
initiative.
some
of
the
other...
all
right,
we're
talking
about
paul
grant.
we're
talking
about
a
case
that
was
four
years
ago,
and
i'm
not
trying
to
say
that
this
case
is
moot.
but
when
we
were
unable
to
pay
petition
circulators,
this
hurt
our
effort,
and
it
took
a
lot
of
momentum
out
of
the
movement.
nancy
bigbee
i
would
say
is
probably
the
principal
mover
behind
this
issues
at
today's
date,
and
she
wishes
to
go
forward
with
it.
thank
you
very
much.
