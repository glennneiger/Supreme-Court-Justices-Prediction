justice
stevens
i
suppose
he
could
also
be
at
it
if
he
had
been
convicted
of
election
fraud,
too.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
if
it's
a
violation
of
the
statute
for
a
person
to
say
ask
his
son
or
daughter
to
go
around
the
neighborhood
getting
signatures
of
the
people
that
the
family
knows,
and
then
the
person
who
makes
the
affidavit
says,
to
the
best
of
his
or
her
knowledge,
these
signatures
are
registered
voters
and
so
forth.
that
wouldn't
violate
the
statute,
would
it?
justice
stevens
no,
the
daughter
is
not.
my
assumption
is
that
the
parent
is
a
registered
elector,
and
the
parent
will
sign
the
statement
and
the
affidavit
that
will
ask
the
kids
in
the
family
to
take
them
to
people
that
the
parent
reasonably
believes
to
be
electors.
would
that
violate
the
statute?
justice
stevens
because
it
just
says...
as
you
read
and
describe
in
your
brief,
you
say
they
sign
an
affidavit
saying
that
each
signature
is
a
signature,
to
the
best
of
their
know,
is
the
person
whose
name
it
purports
to
be,
and
that
to
the
best
of
their
knowledge
and
belief
each
person
is--
justice
stevens
--but
i
do
not
think
the
statute
requires
that
you
witness
the
signatures,
does
it?
justice
stevens
well,
that
was
before
that
was
enacted.
justice
stevens
no,
in
the
circular
it
says,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
belief,
he
is
registered.
justice
stevens
so
i
assume
normally
what
happens
is
you
meet
somebody
on
the
street
and
you
say,
are
you
a
registered
voter.
he
says,
yes,
and
you
can
sign
him
up.
justice
stevens
of
course,
that
is
the
safest,
but
i
am
not
sure
the
language
of
the
statute
commands
that.
justice
stevens
now,
how
has
it
been
interpreted?
has
this
been
a
lot
of
litigation
interpreting
this
statute?
justice
stevens
have
there
been
many
cases
interpreting
the
statute?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
what
the
state
interest
the
state
relied
on
in
the
trial
court
was
if
it
wasn't
fraud?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
cases,
meyer
against
colorado
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
that
our
opinion
is
unanimous
in
that
case.
and
in
meyer
against
grant
we
also
have
unanimous
opinion.
the
case
involves
a
colorado
statute
which
provides
that
a
proposed
constitutional
amendment
can
be
placed
on
the
general
election
ballot
if
enough
signatures
--
as
--
are
obtained
supporting
the
amendment.
the
statute
however
provides
that
it's
a
felony
to
pay
people
to
help
circulate
petitions.
and
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
this
provision
violated
the
first
amendment
and
we
agree
unanimously
and
affirm
its
judgment
holding
that
this
statute
violates
the
first
amendment.
