mr.
keith
a.
teel
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
today
raise
two
issues
for
your
consideration.
the
primary
issue
is
not,
as
the
government
suggests
in
its
brief,
the
medical
question
of
whether
alcoholism
is
a
disease.
that
issue
has
been
decided
by
the
congress,
which
has
determined
that
alcoholism
is
a
handicap
and
that
it
is
an
illness,
a
finding
that
is
conclusively
supported
by
the
american
medical
association,
the
american
psychiatric
association,
and
the
national
council
on
alcoholism,
all
of
whom
have
filed
briefs
in
support
of
petitioners
in
this
case.
instead,
the
question
here
is
whether
the
veterans'
administration
can
ignore
congress'
determination
and
enforce
a
regulation
that
defines
alcoholism
to
be
willful
misconduct,
which
regulation
is
applied
to
bar
alcoholic
veterans
from
obtaining
extensions
of
the
time
in
which
to
use
their
va
educational
benefits.
we
contend
that
the
va
cannot
use
such
a
regulation
because
it
is
impermissibly
discriminatory
under
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973.
before
reaching
that
issue,
however,
there
is
a
threshold
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
even
to
consider
the
legality
of
the
willful
misconduct
regulation.
section
211(a)
of
the
veterans
benefits
statutes
precludes
review
of
certain
va
decisions.
the
government
argues
for
a
sweeping
interpretation
of
section
211(a),
one
that
would
bar
review
of
all
va
action
except
constitutional
challenges
to
va
statutes,
and
challenges
by
persons
not
themselves
in
a
position
to
receive
veterans'
administration
benefits
by
who
are
affected
by
va
action.
petitioners
argue
that
section
211(a)
should
be
read
slightly
more
narrowly
and
that
at
a
minimum
review
of
va
regulations
to
determine
whether
they
comply
with
non-va
statutes
is
permitted.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
it
is
because
of
the
text
and
because
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
statutory
scheme
for
review
that
we
believe
congress
created
here,
which
i
will
explain
in
just
a
moment.
the
petitioners
here
are
both
honorably
discharged
veterans.
they
each
have
a
family
history
of
alcoholism,
and
each
of
them
began
drinking
while
they
were
children;
mr.
traynor
at
age
8,
mr.
mckelvey
at
age
13.
after
they
left
the
service,
they
were
both
disabled
by
alcoholism
for
a
period
of
six
to
eight
years.
before
1977,
veterans
were
required
to
use
their
educational
benefits
within
a
period
of
ten
years
following
their
separation
from
the
service.
in
1977,
the
educational
benefits
statute
was
amended
by
the
congress
to
allow
extensions
of
the
limiting
date,
the
ten-year
period,
to
veterans
who
had
been
unable
to
use
those
benefits
within
the
ten
year
period
because
of
a
disability
that
was
not
the
result
of
their
own
willful
misconduct.
both
petitioners
here
applied
for
an
extension
of
the
time
in
which
to
use
their
benefits.
both
were
denied
that
extension
in
decisions
of
the
board
of
veterans
appeals,
in
which
the
board
of
veterans
appeals
stated
explicitly
the
extension
were
being
denied
on
the
basis
of
the
willful
misconduct
regulation
at
issue
here.
thereafter,
both
petitioners
brought
suit;
both
prevailed
on
summary
judgment
in
the
district
courts.
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
mr.
traynor
lost
on
the
jurisdictional
issue
in
the
second
circuit;
mr.
mckelvey
lost
on
the
merits
question
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
we
believe
that
both
courts
were
in
error
on
the
issues
in
which
they
ruled
against
petitioners.
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
jurisdictional
issue.
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
less
attractive
circumstance
for
a
federal
agency
to
argue
that
review
is
precluded.
in
this
case,
the
veterans
administration
refused
to
decide
the
issue
here;
whether
this
regulation
violated
the
rehabilitation
act.
even
though
it
would
not
decide
the
question,
it
contends
that
the
courts
cannot
decide
the
question
either.
finally,
at
the
same
time
it
is
making
these
arguments
to
the
courts,
it
has
repeatedly
during
this
decade
told
the
congress
in
response
to
questions,
and
in
testimony,
that
review
of
va
regulations
is
in
fact
permitted
under
section
211(a).
as
with
any
case
involving
the
question
of
bars
to
judicial
review,
we
begin
here
with
a
strong
presumption
that
there
is
judicial
review
which
can
be
overcome
by
a
clear
and
convincing
showing
that
congress
did
not
intend
such
review.
in
block
v.
community
nutrition
institute,
in
1984,
this
court
enunciated
a
number
of
factors
that
should
be
considered
in
deciding
whether
review
is
precluded.
the
first
of
these
is
the
language
of
the
statute;
others
are
the
structure
of
the
statutory
scheme
and
the
legislative
history.
let
me
address
those
three
elements.
first,
with
respect
to
the
language
of
section
211(a),
is
not
as
sweeping
as
the
government
suggests.
the
specific
language
at
issue
here
is
whether
decisions
of
the
administrator
on
any
question
of
law
or
fact,
under
any
law
administered
by
the
va
providing
benefits
to
veterans
is
barred
from
review.
now,
certainly
the
congress
could
have
drafted
a
statute
far
more
clearly
had
they
intended
to
entirely
preclude
review
of
everything
affecting
the
va.
they
simply
could
have
said,
nothing
the
va
does
can
be
challenged
in
court.
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
we
have
a
statute
here
with
a
number
of
specific
clauses
that
must
be
interpreted.
first,
there's
a
requirement
in
the
statute
that
a
decision
be
on
a
question
of
law
or
fact
arising
under
any
statute
administered
by
the
veterans'
administration.
judge
kearse
noted
in
her
dissent
in
traynor
in
the
second
circuit
that
not
only
was
the
rehabilitation
act
not
administered
by
the
va,
there's
a
distinction
there
between
administering
and
complying
with
a
statute.
presumably
all
federal
agencies
comply
with
federal
statutes
of
broad
scope
that
affect
it.
administering
a
statute,
we
believe,
indicates
some
expertise.
here,
the
president,
by
executive
order,
has
delegated
the
administration
of
section
504
to
the
justice
department.
this
court
recognized
in
its
decision
in
1986
in
bowen
v.
american
hospital
association
that
a
number
of
agencies
have
issued
regulations
under
section
504
and
that
those
agencies
do
not
have
any
particular
expertise
so
there
is
no
reason
to
give
deference
to
those
agencies'
views
with
respect
to
section
504.
the
reason
we
believe
that
is
relevant
is
that
is
some
indication
that
those
agencies
do
not
administer
the
statute;
they
merely
comply
with
a
statute.
secondly,
there
is
a
requirement
that
the
statute
provide
benefits
to
veterans.
again,
the
rehabilitation
act
does
not
do
that.
what
we
have
with
the
rehabilitation
act
is
a
limitation
on
the
power
of
federal
agencies
to
discriminate
against
handicapped
persons
on
the
basis
of
their
handicap.
now,
the
structure
and
the
legislative
history
are
essential
to
understanding
the
scope
of
section
211(a).
it
is
our
position
that
the
congress
crafted
a
rational
scheme
for
review
of
va
actions.
certain
actions
are
subject
to
review
in
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals.
section
4004(a)
of
the
veterans
statutes
establishes
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals.
it
makes
clear
in
section
4004(c)
that
the
board
of
veterans
appeals
does
not
have
authority
to
review
regulations
of
the
veterans'
administration.
it
is
bound
by
those
regulations.
that,
as
petitioners
discovered
here
in
their
administrative
hearings
in
this
case,
is
a
restriction
taken
quite
seriously
by
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals.
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals
in
both
cases
here
stated
that
it
was
powerless
to
review
regulations
of
the
veterans'
administration.
it
was
bound
by
those
regulations.
with
this
view,
this
court
basically
is
left
with
two
alternatives;
one
is
to
make
a
decision
that
nevertheless
despite
the
view
of
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals,
there
is
no
review
available
here.
the
effect
of
that
is
that
the
veterans'
administration
could
pick
and
choose
among
those
federal
statutes
that
it
wanted
to
pay
attention
to.
it
could
decide
not
to
bother
with
the
rehabilitation
act.
it
could
decide
not
to
bother
with
the
civil
rights
act.
and
presumably
under
the
government's
interpretation
of
section
211(a),
the
veterans'
administration
could
do
so
with
impunity.
we
believe
that
that
is
not
supported
by
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
that
the
more
rational
interpretation
of
section
211(a)
is
that
while
decisions
of
the
veterans'
administration
within
the
specific
facts
of
a
veteran's
case
under
veterans'
laws
as
to
whether
a
particular
veteran
is
entitled
to
benefits
is
consigned
to
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals,
but
that
challenges
to
regulations
under
non-veterans'
administration
statutes
may
be
reviewed
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
our
position
is
that
regulations
generally
are
reviewable
because
of
the
distinction
between
decisions
and
regulations
that
we
believe
is
in
section
4004.
i
would
note
that
we
believe
this
is
not
that
case.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
well,
i
know
they
say
that,
and
i
think
the
experience--
mr.
keith
a.
teel
--i
think
there
is
quite
a
lot
of
reason
to
doubt
it.
within
the
last
decade,
four
federal
courts
have
allowed
review
of
regulations,
challenges
to
regulations
that
they
were
in
excess
of
statutory
authority,
that
kind
of
challenge.
there
simply
has
not
been
that
flood
of
litigation
which
you
would
expect
if
the
government's
position
were
correct
here.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
yes.
the
other
point
to
note
here
is
that
we
believe
our
interpretation
here
is
supported
by
the
veterans'
administration.
it's
only
in
this
case
they
seem
to
be
arguing
something
differently.
they
have
repeatedly
expressed
the
view
to
the
congress
that
review
in
these
circumstances
is
permitted.
in
1952,
they
explained
to
the
congress
that
they
believed
that
section
211(a)
barred
review
of
determinations
arising
in
the
facts
of
particular
veterans'
cases
under
particular
veterans'
law,
and
they
gave
as
an
example,
rating
decisions,
degrees
of
disability,
that
kind
of
thing.
no
mention
of
regulations.
more
recently,
the
veterans'
administration
has
been
questioned
repeatedly
since
1980
on
this
issue
by
the
congress
and
has
stated
that
in
their
view,
regulations
of
the
veterans'
administration
are
subject
to
review.
indeed,
what
is
particularly
striking
is
they
most
recently
said
that
in
response
to
a
letter
from
senator
ganston
in
1986,
which
was
after
the
decisions
of
these
courts
on
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
i'm
disputing
that,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
well,
i
would
think
so
myself,
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
what
we
have
here.
the
statutes,
the
legislative
support
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
quite
clearly,
they
have
taken
a
different
view
for
congress.
now,
they
are
no
doubt
here
arguing
a
different
position,
but
that
shouldn't
control.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
i
agree
with
you
it
is
not
legislative
history
in
the
sense
that
this
court
often
refers
to
it.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
pardon
me?
mr.
keith
a.
teel
that's
correct.
but
this
court
has
noted
repeatedly,
and
we
cite
cases
to
support
this
view
that
the
view
of
an
agency
with
respect
to
statutes
that
govern
it
is
entitled
to
some
deference.
that's
the
reason
we
think
that
the
statements
made
by
the
veterans'
administration
to
the
congress
are
significant.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
nevertheless,
i
think
that
the
agency
lives
day
to
day
with
this
statute.
they
presumably
know
what
they
do
is
not
subject
to
review,
and
they
better
get
it
right.
here
their
view
seems
to
be...
other
than
in
this
case...
that
they
think
211(a)
does
not
reach
regulations.
we
think
that
view
is
entitled
to
some
deference,
certainly
consideration
by
this
court
in
resolving
these
issues.
we
think
that
it's
an
indication
that
the
veterans'
administration
recognizes
that
the
statutory
scheme
for
review
that
i
suggested
was
created
by
211(a)
is
in
fact
the
proper
one.
i'd
like
to
now
turn,
if
i
could,
to
the
rehabilitation
act
issue
before
the
court.
our
argument
is
a
simple
one.
we
contend
that
because
alcoholism
has
been
defined
as
a
handicap
under
the
rehabilitation
act,
and
because
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
applies
to
the
va
educational
benefits
program,
the
regulation
here
at
issue
is
impermissibly
discriminatory
and
cannot
stand.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
well,
it
is
a
troubling
aspect
of
this
case,
as
the
government
points
out,
that
the
va
uses
the
same
term,
willful
misconduct,
in
its
disability
statutes
as
it
does
in
these
educational
benefits
statutes.
the
fact
is,
however,
we
believe
that
the
choice
for
the
court
is
to
write
these
petitioners
out
of
the
rehabilitation
act
by
saying
that
you
don't
get
your
benefits,
or
to
worry
about
the
question
of
disability
benefits
which,
if
that
resulted
in
a
problem,
the
congress
could
correct
that
problem.
there's
ample
room
for--
mr.
keith
a.
teel
--well,
under
the
current
statutes,
it
is.
but
i
note,
for
instance,
under
the
rehabilitation
act
under
the
definitions
of
what's
a
handicapped
person
with
respect
to
employment
benefits,
the
congress
has
made
just
that
kind
of
distinction
that
persons
who
are
currently
alcoholics
or
currently
are
drug
abusers
are
not
covered
with
respect
to
employment
opportunities
if
their
problems
would
prevent
them
from
being
able
to
do
their
job.
there
is
that
kind
of
precedent
that
the
congress
has
made
those
small
corrections
when
necessary.
presumably
it
could
do
the
same
thing
here.
last
term
in
arline,
this
court
noted
that
discrimination
against
the
handicapped
often
results
from
insensitivity.
we
believe
this
is
not
such
a
case.
the
regulation
here
is
discriminatory
by
intent.
the
va
knows
about
the
problems
of
alcoholism.
its
hospitals
may
be
the
federal
government's
largest
provider
of
treatment
and
services
to
alcoholics.
and
it
significantly
does
not
make
any
distinction
on
the
basis
of
wilful
misconduct
in
treating
those
patients.
despite
that,
it
continues
to
enforce
a
regulation
that
we
believe
is
based
on
nothing
more
than
the
history
of
the
regulation.
the
regulation
comes
from
the
era
of
prohibition.
it
has
never
been
reconsidered
in
light
of
current
medical
knowledge,
despite
the
united
opposition
of
the
leading
medical
groups
in
this
country
including
the
ama
and
the
american
psychiatric
association.
it
truly
is
reflective,
to
use
the
phrase
used
in
arline
of
archaic
attitudes
and
laws.
and
we
believe
cannot
be
allowed
to
stand.
previous
judicial
decisions
under
section
504
have
created
a
four-part
analysis
for
determining
whether
the
section
504
has
been
violated.
the
first
question
is,
are
the
petitioners
handicapped.
the
answer
here
obviously
is,
yes.
this
court
recognized
in
arline
that
alcoholics
are
covered
by
the
language
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
are
they
otherwise
qualified.
again,
the
facts
in
this
case
indicate
that
the
answer
must
be,
yes.
both
petitioners
here
received
education
after
they
recovered
from
their
alcoholism.
the
government
has
not
disputed
that
point.
third
point,
are
these
programs
covered
by
section
504.
again,
the
answer
is,
yes.
the
government
concedes
that.
the
fourth
point,
have
these
petitioners
been
excluded
solely
on
the
basis
of
handicap.
here,
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals
said,
we've
got
this
regulation
here
that
says
if
you
are
an
alcoholic,
we
can't
give
you
an
extension.
therefore,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
yes.
now,
i
want
to
address
a
point
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
mckelvey
made
because
they
had
some
problem
with
the
notion
that
this
was
exclusion
on
the
basis
of
handicap.
the
majority
there
said
this
was
not
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
handicap
but
rather
on
the
basis
of
conduct.
we
believe
that
that
is
a
distinction
that
does
not
make
sense.
the
key
feature
of
alcoholism
is
the
compulsion
to
drink.
there
may
be
other
points
about
it
but
what
characterizes
the
illness
in
its
active
phase
is
drinking
behavior.
we
believe
the
two
must
be
taken
part
and
parcel,
at
least
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
regulation.
here
the
regulation
was
not
regulating
behavior,
it
was
simply
saying,
if
you
are
an
alcoholic,
you
don't
get
your
benefits.
that
is
a
decision
made
not
on
the
basis
of
any
conduct
but
on
the
basis
of
the
petitioners'
status
as
alcoholics.
in
arline,
this
court
noted
that
the
contagious
effects
of
tuberculosis
cannot
meaningfully
be
distinguished
from
the
disease
itself.
we
believe
here
you
have
essentially
the
same
kind
of
problem.
you
can't
separate
the
drinking
behavior
from
alcoholism.
to
do
so
would
write
alcoholics
entirely
out
of
the
protection
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
we
believe
that
any
federal
agency
could
say
well,
we
understand
you're
an
alcoholic
and
we're
not
saying
anything
about
that.
we're
just
regulating
on
the
basis
of
your
conduct.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
yes.
the
va
applies
the
same
willful
misconduct
standard
in
the
context
of
disability
benefits
as
well
as
these
educational
benefits.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
i
think
it
well
might,
yes,
sir.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
well,
i
think,
as
justice
o'connor
notes,
it's
a
tough
distinction
to
make.
there
are
suggestions
that
the
va
might
be
able,
for
instance,
to
determine
that
if
somebody
knows
they
have
the
problem
of
alcoholism
and
they're
not
receiving
treatment,
that
perhaps
that
alone
is
a
sufficient
basis
to
call
willful
misconduct
in
the
disability
benefit
context.
that
is
a
bit
far
afield
from
this
case.
we
don't
have
that
problem
because
here
we've
got
petitioners
who
are
recovered
from
the
problem
of
alcoholism.
it's
conceivable
the
va
might
try
to
make
those
distinctions.
but
nevertheless,
we
recognize
that
there
is
the
same
language
in
the
statutes
and
that
if
the
congress
perceives
that
to
be
a
problem
as
a
result
of
the
decision
for
petitioners
in
this
case,
they
may
have
to
modify
it.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
well,
that's
right.
and
in
fact,
i'd
like
to
mention
that
legislative
history.
in
our
view,
the
government
makes
much
of
the
point
that
that
reference
in
'77
to
these
regulations.
we
think
that
the
most
that
can
be
made
out
of
that
is
that
congress
felt
the
same
standards
should
be
applied
across
the
board.
that's
a
rational
thing
for
an
agency
to
do.
if
you've
got
the
same
language,
apply
the
same
meaning
to
it.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
well,
in
fact,
i
think
it
is,
it's
very
difficult.
and
i
think
this
court's
decision
for
instance
in
choate
where
you
decided
some
things...
we
reached
some
disparate
impact
under
section
504;
we
may
not
reach
it
all...
has
shown
a
willingness
to
take
things
one
at
a
time.
you
could
have
a
narrow
decision
such
as
that
in
this
case.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
well,
i
think
we
would
have
a
much
more
difficult
case.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
yes,
we
are
principally
relying
on
section
504.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
no,
actually
that's
what
the
government
argues.
the
government
argues
there
is
a
fundamental
inconsistency.
we
don't
argue
that
for
a
minute.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
well,
our
point
is
that
the
inconsistency
here--
mr.
keith
a.
teel
--it's
views
as
expressed
in
a
regulation.
we
do
not
contend
that
they
could
not
then
take
petitioners'
cases
and
direct
them
back
for
the
sort
of--
mr.
keith
a.
teel
--no.
what
i
said
was,
i
think
it
would
be
a
tougher
case.
you
said,
did
we
principally
rely
on
section
504
and
we
do.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
i
concede
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
challenge
that.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
that's
right,
but
that
does
not
have
the
affect,
as
the
government
suggests,
of
repealing
the
'77
statute.
what
it
does
is
mean
they
can't
enforce
this
particular
regulation.
there's
no
inconsistency.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
well,
it
is
no
longer
permissible
with
these
statutes
with
the
rehabilitation
act
to
define
a
condition,
a
handicapping
condition
under
the
rehab
act.
but
to
define
that
as--
mr.
keith
a.
teel
--if
you
assume,
as
is
correct,
the
regulations
implement
that
statute,
i
will
concede
that
point,
but
there
is
no
inherent
contradiction
between
the
two
statutes,
we
believe.
you
can
still
have
a
determination
on
theses
petitioners
of
whether
there
was
something
in
particular
in
their
behavior--
mr.
keith
a.
teel
--make
a
blanket
determination
that
alcoholics
have
engaged
in
misconduct
we
believe
that's
inconsistent
with
the
rehabilitation
act.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
well,
actually,
i'm
not
so
sure
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
veterans'
administration
laws.
the
veterans'
administration
laws,
as
this
court
has
noted
in
previous
opinions,
the
radiation
case
back
in
'85,
are
typically
slanted
in
favor
of
the
veteran.
this
is
something
that
while
maybe
as
a
legal
matter
absent
the
rehabilitation
act,
would
be
consistent
with
veterans'
laws,
i'm
not
sure
that
somebody
couldn't
challenge
it
on
that
basis.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
well,
again,
the
government,
i
believe,
places
too
much
reliance
on
that
history.
i
think
the
most
that
history
stands
for
is
that
the
same
concept
should
be
applied
in
the
same
circumstances,
pardon
me,
applied
in
the
same
way.
willful
misconduct
means
the
same
thing
in
all
contexts.
there
was
no
discussion
in
that
legislative
history
of
what
the
regulation
meant,
and
there
was
certainly
no
consideration
of
it
in
light
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
which
did
not
apply
in
'78
to
this
program.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
address
a
couple
points.
first,
with
respect
to
mr.
ganzfried's
astonishment
at
our
failure
to
discuss
powell
v.
texas,
i
also
note
this
court
has
the
precedent
in
1962
of
robinson
v.
california,
which
explicitly
held
that
it
was
improper
to
punish
people
for
the
status
of
being,
in
that
case,
drug
abusers.
mr.
keith
a.
teel
no.
what
it
said
was,
the
court
there
i
think
was
concerned
about
extending
the
principle
of
you
can't
do
something
to
somebody
just
because
of
their
status
to
regulating
conduct
that
went
along
with
it.
the
express
concern
in
that
case
i
think
was
along
the
lines
of
criminal
statutes
in
the
states,
for
instance,
regulating
drunk
driving.
the
court
wanted
to
make
clear
it
did
not
reach
those
kinds
of
things.
but
with
respect
to
regulation
based
solely
on
somebody's
status
as
an
alcoholic,
which
is
what
we
think
this
regulation
does,
we
think
robinson
is
still
controlling
here.
well,
that
was
in
a
criminal
context,
constitutional
context,
to
the
extent
that
it
has
any
relevance
at
all
or
that
powell
does,
we
contend
we're
robinson
and
we're
not
powell.
the
rehabilitation
act,
as
this
court
noted
in
arline,
requires
an
individualized
determination
of
each
handicapped
person's
situation.
that
is
at
essence
the
problem
with
a
regulation
like
this.
this
regulation
is
discriminatory.
we
believe
it
cannot
stand.
however,
we
contend
that
a
decision
our
way
here,
the
probable
result
of
that
decision
would
be
to
send
these
cases
back
to
the
veteran's
administration
with
a
directive
that
you've
got
the
law
wrong.
the
law
is,
alcoholism
is
a
handicap.
you
can't
discriminate
solely
on
that
basis.
now,
you
have
a
statute
in
1977
that
says
the
va
does
have
a
right
to
decide
whether
a
particular
petitioner,
particular
veteran
engaged
in
willful
misconduct.
the
effective
of
a
decision
for
petitioners
here
is
to
send
these
cases
back
to
the
veterans'
administration
for
that
willful
misconduct
determination.
the
delimiting
date
extension
statute
would
still
have
force.
the
va
just
would
be
unable
on
the
basis
of
these
petitioners'
condition
as
alcoholics
to
say
that
alone
means
you
don't
get
your
benefits.
that
is
in
essence
what
our
case
is
here.
the
va
is
ignoring
the
requirements
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
they
will
continue
to
do
so
as
long
as
this
regulation
stands,
and
therefore,
we
believe
this
regulation
should
be
invalidated
by
the
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
