justice
stevens
yes,
but
this
statutory
provision
really
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
what
the
agency
does;
it
describes
what
courts
may
do.
justice
stevens
mr.
teel,
i
would
like
to
go
back
because
your
argument
i
think
raises
the
point
to
the
question
justice
o'connor
asked
you
earlier.
does
your
argument
also
require
the
same
treatment
of
claims
for
disability
benefits
by
a
veteran?
and
i
particularly
am
concerned
about
the
legislative
history
in
1977
in
which
the
senate
suggested
that
in
determining
whether
the
disability
was
a
result
of
willful
misconduct,
they
wanted
to
apply
the
same
standard
that
was
being
applied
by
the
va
under
this
regulation.
justice
stevens
your
arguments
against
doing
so
in
the
tolling
context
seem
to
me
to
apply
equally
to
the
disability
benefit
claim
context.
justice
stevens
you're
explaining
why
they
should
not
do
it
in
the
context
of
tolling
the
ten-year
prohibition,
but
doesn't
your
argument
also
apply
equally
to
a
claim
by
a
veteran
for
disability
benefits
based
on
his
alcoholism?
justice
stevens
so
you
don't
really
buy
judge
ginsburg's
distinction
of
the
two.
you
say
then
whatever
we
decide
today
will
decide
the
issue
on
disability
benefits?
justice
stevens
not
only
the
same
language
in
the
statute
and
the
regulation,
but
also
legislative
history
suggesting
at
least
in
1977
congress
intended
the
two
rules
to
be
the
same.
justice
stevens
isn't
it
somewhat
unrealistic.
you
say
they
could
have
had
the
benefits,
but
aren't
we
assuming
that
during
the
period
of
alcoholism,
they
really
were
not
fit
to
be
students
in
higher
education
institute.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
still,
doesn't
the
alcoholism
itself,
assuming
it's
serious
enough,
would
not
that
prevent
a
person
from
passing
college
grade
courses?
justice
stevens
i
really
don't
understand
your
argument.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
the
physical
effect
is
just
that
the
person
is
consuming
so
much
alcohol
that
he
or
she
is
unable
to
live
a
normal
life.
are
you
saying--
justice
stevens
--yes,
but
that
conduct
itself
is
sufficient
to
prevent
the
person
from
acquiring
an
education,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
maybe
in
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
regulation,
it
doesn't
count,
but
just
as
a
practical
matter
whether
it
was
otherwise
qualified
or
not,
if
he
is
consuming
large
quantities
of
alcohol
24
hours
a
day,
six
days
a
week,
and
there's
nothing
else...
he
doesn't
break
his
leg
in
an
accident
or
anything
like
the
no
other
conduct...
but
isn't
that
itself
something
that
as
a
practical
matter
makes
it
rather
unrealistic
to
suggest
he
should
be
taking
advantage
of
this
education
benefit.
justice
stevens
he's
drunk
all
the
time.
justice
stevens
if
he
had
been
hospitalized
for
30
days
because
of
alcoholism,
then
he
would
have
gotten
credit
for
that
30
days
in
the
tolling?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
ganzfried,
that's
because
these
cases
arise
in
that
particular
way.
but
supposing
they
brought
declaratory
judgment
actions
asking
for
a
ruling
on
the
consistency
of
this
regulation
with
the
rehabilitation
act.
then
your
language
of
the
statute
argument
really
wouldn't
fit.
it's
just
that
it
happens
to
arise
in
that
particular
way.
justice
stevens
it's
the
regulation,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
well,
maybe
it's
a
challenge
of
the
failure
of
the
va
to--
justice
stevens
--no,
but
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
you
brought
that
kind
of
a
lawsuit,
the
language
of
211(a)
would
not
read
upon
it.
justice
stevens
the
administrator
could
say,
as
he
did
here--
justice
stevens
--or
the
va
could
say,
as
it
did
here,
we're
just
not
interested
in
deciding
that
question.
they
did
not
decide
it
here,
as
i
understand.
justice
stevens
and
your
position
is
that
nobody
should
decide
it,
nobody
should
decide
it,
because
the
agency
refused
to
and
the
court
says
we
can't.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
question
is
whether
that
regulation,
as
interpreted
by
the
administrator,
continues
to
comport
with
the
law
that
was
passed
in
1978.
justice
stevens
no.
but
do
you
concede
that
there
would
be
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
such
a
proceeding,
notwithstanding
the
language
of
the--
justice
stevens
--yes,
but
are
you
contending
that
the
statute
would
bar
such
a
proceeding?
if
you
are,
why
are
you
suggesting
that's
the
way
they
should
have
done
it?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
i
don't
understand
that
as
a
jurisdictional
argument
unless
you're
saying
that
there
would
have
been
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
if
you're
not
saying
that,
they
could
have
written
him
a
letter,
too,
and
said,
please
reexamine
this.
they
could
have
done
a
lot
of
things.
justice
stevens
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
requires
them
to
do
those.
and
i
still
don't
know
what
your
answer
is
on
whether
there
would
have
been
review
in
an
appropriately
framed
proceeding
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
justice
stevens
mr.
ganzfried,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
supposing
in
1978,
the
va
had
said,
we
want
to
take
another
look
at
this
regulation
and
allow
an
extension
in
this
kind
of
situation.
do
you
think
the
1977
history
would
have
prevented
them
from
doing
it?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that.
do
you
think--
justice
stevens
--do
you
think
they
would
have
been
bound
by
that
1977
history
even
if
they
read
the
1978
legislation
the
way
your
opponent
does?
