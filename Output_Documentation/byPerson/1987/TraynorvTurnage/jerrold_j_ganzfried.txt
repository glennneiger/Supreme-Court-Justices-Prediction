mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
congress
has
spoken
plainly
and
directly
on
the
two
questions
that
are
at
issue
in
these
cases.
one
jurisdictional,
the
other
substantive.
first,
did
congress
intend
to
preclude
judicial
review
in
these
cases.
the
answer
is,
yes.
and
second,
did
congress
intend
for
the
gi
bill
to
be
administered
just
as
the
va
has
administered
it
here.
and
the
answer,
again,
is
yes.
the
common
theme
in
both
issues
is
ultimately
the
principle
that
congressional
intent
must
govern.
the
statute
barring
judicial
review,
section
211(a)
precludes
review
of
decisions
of
the
administrator
on
any
question
of
fact
or
law
under
any
law
administered
by
the
va
providing
benefits.
the
intent
of
this
language
couldn't
be
clearer.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i'm
going
to
explain
how
what's
being
challenged
in
this
case
is
a
decision
by
the
administrator
under
a
law
administered
by
the
va,
namely
the
decision
was
to
deny
the
particular
extension
on
the
educational
benefits
program
to
the
petitioners.
i
would
also
point
out
that
to
the
extent
that
the
petitioners
are
suggesting
that
the
rehabilitation
act
has
required
some
modification
of
the
veterans'
benefits
law,
they're
arguing
that
the
rehabilitation
act
has
been
integrated
into
that
statute,
and
of
course,
it's
the
head
of
the
agency
who
has
been
given
the
responsibility
by
congress
of
implementing
the
rehabilitation
act
within
his
agency's
programs.
there's
a
reference
to
the
department
of
justice.
the
department
of
justice
has
coordinating
responsibilities,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
administrator
has
to
make
a
decision
in
a
benefits
case,
that
subsumes
questions
raised
under
other
statutes,
he's
still
deciding
a
question
under
the
va
benefits
laws.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
correct.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
correct.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
is
not
in
a
position
from
anyone
else
who
is
not
handicapped.
he
had
reasonable
access
to
the
package
of
benefits,
the
educational
benefits
program.
he
had
the
ten
years.
all
that
has
been
denied
is
the
extension
that
congress
provided
in
1977
for
certain
handicapped
people,
and
they
defined
handicapped
people
to
whom
that
extension
would
be
available
and
defined
it
in
a
way
that
did
not
include
the
petitioners
within
that
category.
i
should
make
clear
that
the
va
regulation
does
not
disqualify
alcoholics
from
benefits.
and
as
i
think
your
question
implied,
had
they
applied
during
the
ten-year
period,
and
in
fact
both
of
them
did,
and
did
receive
educational
benefits
during
their
applicable
ten
year
delimiting
periods,
and
they
got
them.
there
was
no
disqualification
on
account
of
alcoholism.
it
just
becomes
a
relevant
consideration
in
connection
with
this
limited
extension
of
the
ten-year
period
that
congress
has
provided
for
certain
handicapped
people.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
as
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals
determined
in
this
case,
they
did
not
meet
any
of
the
statutory
or
va
regulatory
criteria
for
qualifying
for
the
extension.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
we're
not
assuming
that
because
had
they
suffered
consequential
physical
disabilities,
consequential
physical
effects
of
the
alcoholism
that
themselves
would
have
qualified
as
a
disability,
they
would
have
gotten
the
benefits.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
could
but
it
would
be
the
derivative
physical
effects
of
the
alcoholism
and
the
determination
in
these
cases
by
the
board
was
that
the
physical
effects
on
which
the
petitioners
relied
did
not
satisfy
to
meet
other
regulatory
requirements
as
to
how
severe
a
disability
you
have
to
show
to
get
your
benefits.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
okay.
the
regulation--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--i
take
issue
with
one
statement
there.
the
physical
effect
is
consuming
too
much
alcohol,
our
position
that
consuming
too
much
alcohol
is
conduct,
not
a
physical
effect.
if
the
veteran
has
derivative
physical
effects
that
are
so
disabling--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--only
if
he
has
the
consequential
physical
disabilities.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
what
i
have
to
understand
in
the
question
is
are
there
any
physical
consequences
of
his
consuming--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
in
that
case,
if
he's
consuming
alcohol
24
hours
a
day,
if
he's
not
eating,
then
he's
going
to
have
nutritional
deficiencies,
he's
going
to
have
vitamin
deficiencies
which
is
specified
in
the
va
regulation
as...
he
may
have
all
kinds
of
other
physical
maladies
and
consequences
of
it,
and
if
he
has
those
and
if
he
proves
them,
he
gets
the
benefits.
and
the
fact
that
alcoholism
may
have
been
the
cause
is
not
a
disqualification.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
being
unconscious?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
disability
that
would
have
prevented
someone
from
pursuing
an
education.
being
dead
drunk
on
occasions
does
not
disable
someone
from
pursuing
an
educational
program.
the
problem
that
the
petitioners
ran
into
before
the
board
here
was
that...
and
there
are
various
periods
of
hospitalization
in
mr.
traynor's
case.
he
was
hospitalized
five
times
over
the
course
of
four
years,
but
none
of
his
periods
of
hospitalization
were
sufficiently
long
to
satisfy
a
separate
regulatory
requirement
that
only
hospitalization
periods
of
30
days
would
permit
someone
to
get
an
extension
of
benefits.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
may
have,
depending
on
how
the
board
looked
at
what
evidence
he
presented.
but
ordinarily,
the
hospital
records
are
not
going
to
say
often
simply,
hospitalized
30
days
alcoholism.
they're
going
to
indicate
alcoholism
and
because,
as
the
brief
suggests
as
a
very
important
part
of
alcoholism,
and
that
is
denial,
the
fact
that
this
person
is
not
likely
to
be
in
the
hospital
in
the
first
place
unless
there
is
some
physical
manifestation.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no,
it
does
not
say
that.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
va
rule
is
that
alcoholism
is
divided
into
two
categories:
primary
alcoholism
and
secondary.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
secondary
alcoholism,
which
is
the
result
of
any
underlying
psychiatric
disorder,
is
not
a
disqualification.
you
get
the
extension
of
benefits.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
whether
someone's
an
alcoholic
doesn't
always
depend
on
how
much
liquor
he
drinks.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
there
are
people
who
may
drink
as
much
as
someone
who
is
an
alcoholic,
and
yet
those
people
are
not
alcoholics.
there
are
alcoholics
who
may
be
functioning
alcoholics.
there
are
alcoholics
who
may
have
binges
or
weekend
drinking
and
yet
are
able
to
function
at
school
and
at
work
five
days
a
week.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
an
active
alcoholic,
24
hours
a
day,
seven
days
a
week?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
and
showing
the
physical
manifestations
of
that?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
suppose
not.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no,
it's
only
a
group
of
people
who
can
prove
neither--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--that
alcoholism
is
an
illness?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
submit
that
it's
basically
an
irrelevant
question
in
this
context
for
reasons
very
similar
to--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it
can
be.
it
can
be.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
we
don't
know
what
the
average
alcoholism
is.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
primary
alcoholism?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
okay,
what
is
defined
in
the
regulations--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it
can
be.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
is
not
always.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
it's
in
the
regulation
and
the
term
primary
alcoholism
is
essentially
what
the
va
has
determined
to
be
willful
alcoholism.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
can
be.
is
it
in
every
case?
i
don't
know.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
can
be
conduct,
it
can
be
a
compulsion
short
of
an
illness,
it
can
be
an
inclination
short
of
a
compulsion,
it
can
be
a
predisposition.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
we
don't
know.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
statute
simply
says
disability
not
the
result
of
willful
misconduct.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it's
not
talking
about
any
questions
of
taking
away
anyone's
livelihood.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
you
raise
it
in
terms
of
someone's
livelihood.
the
congress
has
said
in
the
rehabilitation
act
that
an
alcoholic
who
is
not
able
to
perform
employment
duties
is
not
a
handicapped
person.
that's
in
the
statute
in
the
rehabilitation
act.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
this
statute
doesn't
say,
alcoholism.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no,
it's
a
regulation
and
the
va
policy,
it
says
primary
regulation.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
doesn't
address
the
question
whether
it's
an
illness.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
primary
alcoholism.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
regulation
doesn't
say.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
terms
of
providing
rehabilitation
and
treatment,
the
answer
to
that,
in
terms
of
the
veterans'
administration
is,
yes.
and
it
provides
$100
million
in
in-patient
rehabilitation
alcoholism
services
each
year,
and
for
rehabilitation,
it
regards
it
as
an
illness.
it
will
help
people
overcome
the
condition.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
some
contexts.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no.
because
illness
is
not
necessarily
a
disability.
i
guess
i've
gotten
a
bit
afield
from
the
section
211(a),
but
i
think
the
colloquy
points
out
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
very
complex
questions
that
touch
on
a
very
intricate
ganglion
of
nerves
in
society
that
cuts
across
questions
of
medicine
and
law
and
philosophy
and
religion.
the
case
doesn't
have
to
be
decided
on
that
level,
but
the
issues
do
implicate
all
of
those
concerns.
the
basis
for
deciding
the
case
is
really
determining
congress'
intent
in
two
statutes.
211(a)
in
which
it
said,
no
review
because
it
didn't
want
the
courts
to
get
involved
in
day
to
day
determinations
of
va
policy
and
va
benefits.
and
it's
clear
that
that's
exactly
what
is
really
involved
in
these
cases.
it's
clear
from
the
prayers
for
relief
in
the
district
courts.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
without
ever
first
doing
something
like
petitioning
the
administrator
of
the
va
to
reconsider?
i
mean,
what's
the
agency
action
that's
being
challenged
here?
it's
either
the
benefits
determination
in
their
cases--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--or
it's
a
regulation
that
was
promulgated
in
1972
before
the
rehabilitation
act
was
passed,
six
years
before
it
became
applicable
to
federal
programs,
and
it's
simply
not
an
appropriate
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
to
come
into
court--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--without
having
gone
to
the
head
of
the
agency
petitioning
him
to
reconsider
his
regulation
as--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it
might.
it
might,
because
what
might
happen
is
that
the
administrator
could
say
that
this
was
a
question
of
whether
i
should
interpret--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--the
benefits
law
to
have
the
following
consequences
on
the
benefits
law
as
a
result
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals
didn't
decide
it
here.
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals
was
deciding
the
particular
eligibility--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--no,
we've
got
to
forums
here,
neither
one
of
which
was
addressed
by
the
petitioners.
the
first
is
a
petition
to
the
administrator.
the
administrator
has
by
issuing
this
as
a
regulation
and
not
maintaining
it
as
a
decision
which
it
had
been
in
earlier
years
in
1931
and
1964,
they
were
decisions
by
the
administrator,
individual
determinations,
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
in
1972,
the
administrator
put
that
into
a
regulation.
and
the
administrator--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--yes,
and
the
answer
is
you
go
back
to
the
administrator,
the
person
who
promulgated
the
regulation,
553(e)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
which
has
been
incorporated
here
by
the
va,
says
you
go
back
and
you
petition
to
the
head
of
the
agency,
or
you
go
to
congress.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
it's
altogether
different
from
this
case
and
it's
not
a
concession
that--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--because
they
could
have
gotten
relief.
there
might
not
have
been
a
need
for
a
proceeding.
or
having
gotten
that
decision
from
the
administrator
to
go
in,
to
present
the
medical
evidence,
to
present
whatever
you'd
like
to
present
from
the
recent
medical
literature
and
say,
look,
times
have
changed,
the
statute
has
changed.
we
think
that
a
rethinking
is
in
order
here.
the
administrator
has,
independent
of
the
fact
that
there
had
been
no
such
petition
for
that,
has
looked
at
this
question.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
right,
but
they
did
none
of
them.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
ultimately
what
it
was
was
a
decision
by
the
administrator
under
a
law
administered
by
the
va,
the
answer
to
that
has
got
to
be
that
there
would
not
be
judicial
review.
let
me
address
the
question
briefly
as
to
whether
review
extends
only
to
regulations
or
turn
that
around,
whether
the
preclusion
of
review
extends
only
to
adjudications
in
individual
cases,
or
it
applies
to
regulations
as
well.
the
petitioners
have
argued
that
there
has
been
very
little
litigation
on
this
subject,
very
few
cases
brought,
even
though
a
number
of
circuits
have
permitted
judicial
review
of
va
decisions
in
particular
instances.
the
question
really
isn't
whether
we
can
predict
whether
flood
gates
will
open
and
the
waters
will
rush
in.
it's
more
important
to
look
at
what
congress
was
saying
when
it
was
writing
the
statute
and
whether
it
was
concerned
about
flood
gates,
and
the
answer
to
that
is,
yes.
in
1970,
when
211
was
amended
to
its
present
form
as
this
court
discussed
in
its
decision
in
johnson
v.
robison,
it
was
done
as
a
reaction
to
decisions
by
the
d.c.
circuit
that
had
permitted
review
in
certain
circumstances.
and
the
legislative
history
which
is
discussed
in
johnson
v.
robison,
and
is
also
discussed
in
then
judge
scalia's
opinion
in
the
case
of
gott
v.
walters,
indicates
that
there
was
concern
that
there
were
353
cases
pending
in
the
d.c.
circuit
alone,
and
that
there
was
concern
that
future
cases
would
be
brought
based
on
individual
benefits
determinations
and
regulations.
and
that
was
part
of
congress'
concern
and
that
is
part
of
the
basis
upon
which
congress
amended
the
statute
to
read
the
way
it
does
today.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
used
the
term,
claims,
and
what
the
d.c.
circuit
had
said,
well,
that
would
preclude
judicial
review
if
you're
coming
in
and
applying
for
benefits,
but
in
instances
where
benefits
were
discontinued
or
benefits
were
forfeited
for
some
reason,
the
court
had
held
that
you
can
come
into
court
because
that's
not
a
claim
for
benefits,
that's
something
that
happens
after
you're
already
getting
benefits.
and
congress
came
in
and
said,
no,
we
want
no
review;
we
don't
want
to
involve
the
courts
in
the
day
to
day
workings
of
the
va.
now,
would
a
decision
that
you
could
challenge
regulations,
even
the
validity
of
regulations
under
other
statutes
interfere
with
the
day
to
day
workings
of
the
va?
and
the
answer
to
that
is,
yes.
just
one
example
is
that
the
va
has
a
regulation
on
the
ratings
for
disability
of
malaria.
it's
got
four
categories
that
rate
the
disability
from
100
percent
to
50
percent
to
30
percent
to
10
percent.
the
gradations
depend
on
such
things
as
whether
there
have
been
three
relapses
in
a
six
month
period
or
two
relapses
in
a
six
month
period.
i
suppose
that
someone
could
claim
that
current
medical
evidence
makes
that
distinction
inappropriate,
that
two
serious
relapses
is
more
important
than
three
not
so
serious
relapses,
and
that
he
shouldn't
be
discriminated
against
because
he
happened
to
have
two
rather
than
three
relapses
of
malaria.
well,
under
petitioners'
theory,
he
would
get
into
court.
that's
just
one
example.
asthma
is
another
condition
with
four
categories.
high
blood
pressure
has
four
categories.
ulcers
have
five.
epilepsy
has
six.
and
blindness
has
more
than
100
different
ratings
categories
in
the
regulations
that
depend
upon
the
degree
of
impairment
division.
a
suggestion
that
reviewing
regulations
would
not
inject
the
courts
into
the
day
to
day
workings
of
the
va
has
no
basis
in
fact.
now,
if
the
court
concludes
despite
the
arguments
i've
made
and
those
in
our
brief,
that
there
is
jurisdiction
for
these
cases
to
proceed--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--sure.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
didn't
hear
the
middle
part--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--i
think
that
view
as
amplified
in
his
opinion
in
the
gott
case,
gott
v.
walters,
an
earlier
case
that
was
the
opinion
was
vacated
upon
granting
of
rehearing
en
banc
and
then
the
case
was
settled
but
the
opinion
is
cited
in
some
of
the
briefs
mentioned
briefly
in
a
quotation
in
our
brief.
that
explanation
is
an
appropriate
one.
there's
also
a
procedural
wrangle
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
administrator
or
the
va
had
decided
the
issue
or
hadn't
decided
the
issue.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
question
of
whether
a
decision--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it
would
have
enormous
implications.
let
me
say
something
about
a
case,
considering
the
subject
matter
of
this
case
it
is
quite
astonishing
that
the
case
has
not
been
mentioned
before.
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
been
asked
to
consider
the
legal
ramifications
of
alcoholism.
in
powell
v.
texas,
the
court
refused
to
accept
the
blanket
rule
that
alcoholics
may
not
be
asked
to
bear
some
degree
of
responsibility
for
their
conduct,
criminal
responsibility
in
that
case.
and
the
court
recognized
that
alcoholism
is
not
merely
status,
it
involves
conduct,
drinking,
for
which
there
may
be
an
element
of
volition,
at
least
at
some
point
in
the
progression
leading
toward
chronic
alcoholism.
now,
the
powell
case
is
discussed
in
our
brief
in
several
places,
but
it's
not
mentioned
in
petitioners
brief
or
reply
brief,
or
in
any
of
the
amicus
submissions
and
hasn't
been
mentioned
today.
i've
tried
to
explain
that
the
va
policy
is
not
a
blanket
disqualification
of
alcoholics
from
benefits.
they
get
rehabilitation
and
treatment
and
medical
services.
they
also
get
educational
benefits
if
they
apply
within
the
ten
years.
so
there's
some
reasonable
access
to
the
package
of
benefits
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
the
language
of
willful
misconduct,
that
is
language
that
petitioners
try
to
paint
as
deriving
from
prohibition.
what's
more
important
about
that
language
is
that
it
derives
from
the
statutes
that
deal
with
veterans
benefits
for
disability
compensation
and
pensions.
and
no
one
can
seriously
claim
that
a
disability
compensation
which
amounts
to
$1355
a
month
for
a
total
disability
and
that's
not
an
income-sensitive
amount,
that
that
should
be
paid
to
someone
whose
sole
disability
is
alcohol
abuse
or
drug
abuse.
and
i
should
mention
that
the
va
has
a
regulation
that
treats
drug
abuse,
for
the
purposes
of
these
programs,
in
a
similar
way
to
the
way
it
treats
alcoholism.
because
to
take
that
position
would
be
tantamount
to
paying
that
person
for
life
to
continue
drinking
or
taking
drugs,
and
would
discourage
treatment
or
rehabilitation.
and
it
is
certainly
an
appropriate
response
for
congress
to
take
to
say
that
funds
would
be
better
spent
on
rehabilitation
and
treatment
than
on
simply
providing
pensions
and
disability
compensations.
and
i
should
add
also
that
a
claim
along
those
lines
has
already
been
made,
a
claim
for
alcoholism
disability
has
been
made
in
the
pension
area
and
is
pending
in
the
third
circuit
and
is
mentioned
in
our
briefs.
now,
in
1977,
congress
incorporated
the
willful
misconduct
language
into
the
educational
benefit
program
to
assess
who
was
entitled
to
this
extension.
and
it
took
a
term
of
art.
it
didn't
make
up
some
language.
it
took
a
term
of
art
that
had
a
particular
meaning
that
had
evolved
in
va
pension
determinations
over
the
course
of
years,
a
position
that
was
first
addressed
in
1931,
was
reviewed
again
in
1964,
and
was
reviewed
again
in
1972
when
the
present
regulation
was
promulgated
and
sent
out
for
notice
and
comment,
and
there
was
only
one
comment
on
this
regulation
when
it
was
proposed
in
1972.
so
the
va's
position
is
not
as
it's
been
suggested
woodenly
fixed
in
the
early
days
of
the
century.
it
has
evolved
in
response
to
changing
conditions
as
to
the
facts
as
they
were
presented.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
would
have
made
it
awfully
difficult
and
the
va
came
to
that
conclusion,
because
there's
legislative
history
in
1979
and
1981
when
members
of
the
senate
committee
that
oversees
the
va
said
we
really
don't
want
you
to
apply
this
alcoholism
standard
in
the
educational
benefits
extension
context.
and
the
va
went
up
there
and
said,
well,
you
may
say
that
now,
but
in
your
committee
report
in
1977
you
said
that
by
using
the
term,
willful
misconduct,
we
intend
for
the
va
to
apply
that
term
as
it's
applied
it
in
the
other
contexts,
and
specifically
referenced
this
regulation--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--and
the
provision
from
the
manual.
and
the
va
went
back
to
congress
and
said,
you
may
have
something
different
in
mind,
but
we've
concluded
that
we're
bound
by
what
you
told
us
in
'77.
you
told
us,
you
must
do
this.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
still
yes,
but
it's
a
question
for
the
administrator
to
take
up
in
the
first
instance
because
the
1978
legislation
is
more
general
and
it
doesn't
repeal
something
that's
more
specific.
if
it
requires
a
different
result,
then
you
do
have
to
address
whether
it
effected
an
appeal
by
implication.
