justice
o'connor
i
guess
under
your
view,
disability
payments
would
have
to
be
made
as
well,
wouldn't
they?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
distinguish
legally,
wouldn't
it,
if
you're
right?
justice
o'connor
may
i
ask
one
question
on
that
point,
mr.
ganzfried?
justice
o'connor
do
you
agree
with
the
view
taken
by
then-judge
scalia
in
the
mckelvey
case
that
the
administrator
necessarily
decided
in
the
benefit
claims
case
that
the
regulation
was
consistent
with
the
rehab
act?
justice
o'connor
judge
scalia's
view
in
the
mckelvey
case,
do
you
agree
with
it?
justice
o'connor
would
that
view
have
implications
for
us
in
terms
of
our
jurisdiction
in
other
cases
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
whether
necessarily
encompasses
others?
