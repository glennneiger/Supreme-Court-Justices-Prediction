justice
marshall
isn't
this
tough
enough
for
us
to
take
it
one
step
at
a
time?
justice
marshall
but
this
rule
doesn't
say
anything
about
physical
manifestations
or
anything
else
about
being
drunk
or
anything.
it
says,
if
you're
an
alcoholic;
that's
all.
justice
marshall
what
does
it
say?
justice
marshall
right.
justice
marshall
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
how
much
liquor
he
drinks
or
anything
else.
justice
marshall
that's
what
i'm
talking
about;
that's
exactly
what
i'm
complaining
about.
justice
marshall
i
guess
he
couldn't
teach
either,
could
he,
if
he's
an
alcoholic?
he
couldn't
teach,
could
he?
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
that's
right,
but
you
pick
on
this
one
group.
justice
marshall
who
are
sick.
have
you
admitted
that
this
is
an
illness?
justice
marshall
that
alcoholism
is
an
illness?
justice
marshall
well,
do
you
mind
answering
an
irrelevant
question?
do
you
agree
that
it
is
an
illness?
justice
marshall
do
you
agree
that
the
"average
alcoholism"
in
quotes,
is
an
illness?
justice
marshall
well,
the
one
that
you're
talking
about
in
your
statute?
justice
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
marshall
is
that
an
illness?
justice
marshall
is
it?
justice
marshall
it's
in
your
statute,
you
put
it
in
there.
justice
marshall
is
it
an
illness?
justice
marshall
mr.
ganzfried,
if
it's
not
an
illness,
what
is
it?
justice
marshall
is
that
what
they're
talking
about?
justice
marshall
oh,
you
mean
the
statute's
indefinite?
justice
marshall
and
the
regulations
are
indefinite.
they're
not
too
indefinite
to
take
away
a
man's
livelihood.
justice
marshall
well,
i'm
asking
you,
is
it
an
illness,
or
not?
justice
marshall
i'm
talking
about
this
statute
which
says,
alcoholism.
justice
marshall
it
says
primary?
justice
marshall
well,
is
that
regulation
an
illness
when
it
says
alcoholism
in
the
regulation?
justice
marshall
well,
does
it
say
alcoholism?
primary
alcoholism?
justice
marshall
well,
is
that
or
not...
i'm
going
to
try
this
one
more
time,
and
then
i'm
through:
is
it
or
is
it
not
an
illness.
justice
marshall
well,
is
it
or
is
it
not.
is
it
administered
as,
or
is
it
not?
justice
marshall
you
agree,
it
is
an
illness.
justice
marshall
it
took
quite
awhile,
but
i
made
it.
mr.
ganzfried,
let
me
try
to
bring
this
down
to
earth.
i
take
it
that
the
issue
much
proclaimed
by
the
media
as
to
whether
alcoholism
is
or
is
not
a
disease
is
not
really
very
relevant
in
this
case,
is
it?
