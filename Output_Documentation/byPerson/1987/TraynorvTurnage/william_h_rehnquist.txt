william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
teel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
because
of
the
text,
mr.
teel,
that
you
say
that
review
of
regs
to
see
if
they
comply
with
non-va
statutes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
challenges
to
regulations
under
va
statutes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
government
says
there
are
just
thousands
and
thousands
of
regulations
if
you
say
any
decision
based
on
a
regulation
is
reviewable
that
there
are
just
going
to
be
all
sorts
of
cases
coming
into
the
courts.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
have
reason
to
doubt
it
if
we
were
to
say
that
va
statute
regulations
as
well
as
non-va
statute
regulations
were
reviewable?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
these
were
allowing
review
of
regulations
based
on
va
statutes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
mr.
teel,
here
we
have
the
veterans'
administration
appearing
formally
before
us
by
the
solicitor
general,
and
he's
saying
this
is
what
the
veterans'
administration,
this
is
their
position.
now,
we
ordinarily
accept
that.
you
may
argue
that
it
has
not
been
consistently
applied
in
the
past,
but
we
ordinarily
take
the
solicitor
general's
word
for
what
the
va's
position
is.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
say
the
veterans'
administration
itself
believes
the
way
you
do.
if
it
did,
obviously,
there
wouldn't
be
any
lawsuit.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say
legislative
support,
and
you've
cited
states
made,
or
you
think
were
made...
and
probably
were...
by
va
people
to
the
congress,
but
that
isn't
legislative
support.
that
may
be
an
inconsistent
position
by
the
agency.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
any
orthodox
sense.
chief
justice
rehnquist
or
in
any
orthodox
sense.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
light
of
the
senate
history
in
1977?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
teel.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
ganzfried.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
is
being
dead
drunk
so
to
speak
a
physical
consequence
that
would
entitle
him
to
some
sort
of
benefits?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
did
it
read
before
the
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ganzfried.
mr.
teel,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
didn't
powell
say
it
wouldn't
apply
the
robinson
principle
in
the
case
of
alcoholics?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
teel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
no.
86-622,
traynor
against
turnage
and
a
companion
case
no.
86-1461,

j.
debartolo
