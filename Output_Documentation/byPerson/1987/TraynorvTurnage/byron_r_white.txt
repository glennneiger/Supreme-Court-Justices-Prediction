justice

if
there
had
been
no
rehabilitation
act,
the
veterans'
administration
would
withstand
challenge
of
its
interpretation
and
application
to
alcoholics
of
this
tolling
provision,
without
the
rehabilitation
act
section
504,
you
would
not
have
a
case,
i
take
it?
justice
white
but
that's
your
principal
reliance?
justice
white
so
here's
an
act
that
was
being
administered
as
it
was
supposed
to
be
administered,
and
then
came
the
rehabilitation
act
and
you
say
there's
a
fundamental
inconsistency
between
the
two
statutes?
justice
white
what
are
you
arguing?
justice
white
yes,
but
you
say
that
the
rehabilitation
act
requires
the
veterans'
administration
to
change
its
views.
justice
white
i
know,
but
i
thought
that
you
answered
that
the
veterans'
administration
position
in
its
regulation
would
be
perfectly
acceptable
absent
the
rehabilitation
act.
justice
white
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
regulation
was
quite
valid,
absent
the
rehabilitation
act,
and
hence
the
regulation
is
a
valid
regulation
under
the
applicable
statutes.
and
that
expresses
the
meaning
of
the
statute
or
a
permissible
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
that
it
was
a
permissible
interpretation
of
the
statute.
now,
you
in
effect
say
that
the
rehabilitation
act
made
it
an
impermissible
construction
of
the
statute.
justice
white
well,
the
reason
they
can't
is
because
it
is
no
longer
a
permissible
interpretation
of
the
veterans'
statute.
justice
white
yes,
but
you're
arguing
that
the
rehabilitation
act
means
that
the
veterans'
laws
governing
the
veterans'
administration
can
no
longer
be
construed
the
way
the
veterans'
administration
has
been
construing
them.
justice
white
but
you
say
that
the
rehabilitation
act
means
that
there
is
no
longer
any
room
to
construe
the
laws
of
the
veterans'
administration
is
administering
in
the
way
that
they
have
been
construed.
justice
white
even
though
absent
it,
it
was
quite
consistent
with
the
veterans'
administration
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
opinion
in
the
traynor
case
actually
covers
two
cases,
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
opinion
that
we
have
filed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
reversed
and
remanded,
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
brennan
and
marshall
have
joined.
justices
scalia
and
kennedy
did
not
participate
in
these
cases.
