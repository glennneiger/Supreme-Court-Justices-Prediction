you
feel
that's
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
justice
blackmun
you're
going
to
explain
how
the
rehab
act
is
administered
by
the
veterans'
administration?
justice
blackmun
mr.
ganzfried,
i
want
to
be
sure...
as
long
as
the
ten
years
has
not
expired,
the
veteran
is
entitled
to
this
assistance,
isn't
he?
justice
blackmun
even
though
he's
an
alcoholic?
justice
blackmun
and
all
you're
doing
is
denying
him
the
necessary
time
to
get
the
full
benefit?
justice
blackmun
well,
i
take
it
you
imply
that
their
delay
in
completing
their
education
was
due
to
the
continuing
disability
due
to
alcoholism?
