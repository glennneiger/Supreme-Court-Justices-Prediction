mr.
richard
bain
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
are
here
this
morning
on
a
case
involving
a
1985
amendment
to
a
virginia
statute
shielding
the
exposure
of
juveniles
to
certain
sexually
explicit
material
by
regulating
the
manner
of
its
display,
and
despite
outward
appearances,
frankly,
from
reading
both
sides'
briefs,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
really
very
simple,
because
we
really
have
one
issue,
and
the
issue
turns
on
the
type
of
material
that
this
amendment
affects.
now,
from
the
start
of
this
litigation,
from
literally
the
first
page
of
the
transcript,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
painted
a
picture
of
a
statute
with
a
very
broad
range
effect,
a
range
of
material
involving
material
with
great
beauty
and
great
literary
value,
a
range
of
material
that
they
include
james
joyce's
ulysses,
william
faulkner's
sanctuary,
and
even
the
penguine
book
of
love
poetry,
which
is
an
anthology
of
all
the
great
poems
of
the
english
language
from
robert
browning
to
alfred
lord
tennyson.
if
that
range
is
correct,
if
they
are
correct
that
this
amendment
involves
that
material,
then
we
lose
the
case,
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
we
should
lose
the
case,
because
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
does
not
desire
to
restrict
in
any
way,
directly
or
indirectly,
that
type
of
material.
but
by
the
same
token,
if
the
material
affected
is
not
this
broad
range,
then
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
plaintiffs
cannot
prevail,
because
every
burden
that
they
speculate
about,
every
terrible
effect
that
they
speculate
about,
all
of
their
evidence
in
the
district
court,
everything
in
their
brief,
and
i
am
sure
everything
that
mr.
bator
is
going
to
say
this
morning
turns
on
that
concept
of
this
broad
range
material,
and
i
would
say--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--yes,
justice
brenner,
it
is
a
facial
attack.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
statute
they
are
attacking,
the
statute
involving
this
broad
range
of
material
is
a
hypothetical
statute.
it
does
not
exist
in
virginia.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
justice
o'connor,
i
am
sure
today
that
the
day
that
i
die
my
tombstone
is
going
to
say
"richard
b.
smith
said
hollywood
wives
was
obscene.
"
i
have
said
it
over
and
over
again.
what
we
said
was,
one
of
their
witnesses
said,
of
all
the
exhibits
that
they
put
in,
of
all
their
exhibits,
that
was
the
only
one
that
she
said
she
thought
children
should
not
see.
and
so
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
brief,
i
think
it
was
in
a
footnote,
i
said,
of
all
the
exhibits,
that
was
the
only
one
that
might
be
involved
based
on
what
she
had
said.
i
have
since
gone
back...
i
came
up,
i
looked
through
all
the
exhibits.
not
one
exhibit
they
have
submitted
falls
within
this
statute,
including
hollywood
wives.
now,
what
we
suggest
to
the
court
this
statute
involves
is
not
this
broad
range
of
conceded
beauty,
conceded
literary
value,
of
very
narrow
range.
this
statute
deals
with
borderline
obscenity.
it
deals
with
exactly
the
same
thing
that
ginsburg
v.
new
york
dealt
with,
borderline
obscenity.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
justice
o'connor,
i
would
submit
that...
i
agree
with
what
mr.
bator
said
in
his
brief,
that
really
the
standing
question
and
the
merits
question
here
turn
on
the
same
thing.
if
the
material
they
are
talking
about
is
this
broad
range,
then
they
have
standing,
because
concededly
that
is
the
type
of
material
that
they
are
displaying
and
have
been
selling
to
juveniles,
and
we
concede
that,
what
they
are
talking
about.
but
the
point
is
that
the
burden
that
they
have
suggested
exists
here
is
that
because
of
this
broad
range
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
be
able
to
comply
with
the
statute
both
financially
and
otherwise
without
putting
themselves
out
of
business,
or
at
least
severely
restricting
their
business.
and
because
of
that,
they...
both
their
first
amendment
rights
and
the
first
amendment
rights
of
adults
will
be
overly
restrictive.
and
that,
i
think,
is
the
importance
of
this
broad
range
effect,
because
if
we
are
talking
about
this
narrow
range
of
borderline
obscenity,
for
one
thing,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
there
is
any
burden
whatsoever
placed
on
them
by
that
type
of
material.
and
secondly,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--i
would
suggest
to
the
court
two
ways.
first,
the
amendment
and
the
definitional
statute,
because
that
is
something
that
the
plaintiffs
have
purposely
ignored
in
this
case.
it
is
something
that
their
witnesses
below
were
never
shown,
was
the
definitions
of
the
material
involved
in
this
case.
and
i
would
submit
that
both
from
the
face
of
the
statute
and
their
evidence
supports
that
there
is
this
narrow
range,
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
the
definitions
involved
here
are
the
same
ones
that
the
statute
in
ginsburg
versus
new
york
used.
it
is
not
just
any
sex,
any
sexual
content
that
is
in
a
book.
and
that
is
where
they
have
made
their
big
mistake.
they
have
assumed
all
the
way
through
that
if
there
is
any
sexual
content
whatsoever,
then
this
material
falls
within
our
amendment.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
district
court
in
alexandria,
and
then
up
to
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
they
never
really
focused
on
it.
the
district
court
never
discussed--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--the
fourth
circuit
did
a
very
strange
thing.
the
fourth
circuit
refused
to
accept
any
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court
below,
and
then
they
took
some
findings--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--justice
white--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--they
were
talking
about
a
different
statute,
because
they
were
looking
at
a
statute
from
georgia.
that--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--they
never
came
to
grips
with
this
issue.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
they
never
discussed
one
way
or
the
other.
what
they
did,
they
talked
about
a
case
from
georgia
in
which
evidence
there
dealt
with
a
statute
that
the
court
there
found
had
this
broad
reach,
and
that
is
what--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--as
i
said,
if
you
take
the
broad
view,
we
lose,
but
i
would
suggest
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--what
they
did
was,
they
said,
we
assume
that
there
are
these
burdens.
they
never
got
into
construing
the
statute
one
way
or
the
other,
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
actually
gotten
to
the
statute,
we
are
asking
this
court
to
look
at
it
a
second
time,
because
we
are
suggesting
that
it
is
a
matter
of
law,
not
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
there
was
a
request
for
an
extension.
we
were...
the
attorney
general's
office
was
brought
into
this
case
on
the
certification
of
2403(b).
one
of
the
other
defendants
and
all
the
defendants
did
ask
the
district
court
to
abstain.
and
ironically,
the
reason
the
district
court
refused
to
abstain
was
because
he
said
there
was
no
unclear
parts
of
the
statute,
and
yet
for
the
last
two
years
both
the
plaintiffs
and
the
state
have
been
arguing
over
the
meaning
of
all
these
terms.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
we
raised
the
question
of
the
district
court
should
have
applied
the
narrowing
constructions
of
the
statute.
we
did
not
in
so
many
words
say
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
in
the
sense
of
abstention
doctrine.
we
were
arguing
that
under
the
first
amendment
overbreadth
test
the
district
court
should
have
narrowed
the
construction.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
the
plaintiffs
say
we
did.
the
plaintiffs
say
we
have
been
arguing...
that
is
what
we
have
been
arguing
all
along,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
fact
say
that
abstention...
they
addressed
the
issue
and
said
abstention
was
not
appropriate.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
they
passed
on
it,
if
i
am
not
mistaken.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
what
they
said
was
this,
and
this
is
what
i
was
starting
to
say
earlier.
i
have
never
seen
this
done
in
any
case.
the
fourth
circuit
said
the
evidence
presented
below
is
so
minimal
that
we
can't
make
a
determination
from
what
the
district
court--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--of
the
percentage
of
books
involved.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
the
district
court
made
that
finding.
then
the
court
of
appeals
say,
but
we
assume
that
it
does,
and
then
they
went
off
on
this
tangent
on
the
statute
in
georgia
that
has
a
completely
different
statute
than
virginia's,
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
reason
that
this
statute
deals
with
borderline
obscenity
and
not
this
broad
range,
as
i
said
earlier,
it
is
from
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
only
involves
certain
very
narrowly
restricted
types
of
activities.
it
has
to
have--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--i
cannot
remember.
i
honestly
cannot
remember.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
if
you
read
on
with
the
footnote,
justice--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--if
you
read
on
with
the
footnote,
they
say,
and
the
state
said
there
is
a
very
miniscule
amount
of
material
involved.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
right,
and
the
fourth
circuit
never
said
who
was
right,
and
when
you
go
back
up
to
what
that
is
footnoted
to,
the
fourth
circuit
said,
whatever,
we
are
going
to
assume
that
there
is
this
broad
range,
and
they
cited
to
this
case
in
georgia
that
is
a
completely
different
statute
involving
a
completely
different
range
of
material.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
yes.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
yes.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
as
i
said
earlier,
we--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--i
believe...
i
think
this
court
has
made
it--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--this
court
has
made
it
clear
for
the
last
three
decades
that
the
question
of
what
is
obscene
in
a
book
is
a
matter
of
law,
not
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
you
have
to
remember--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--no,
justice
scalia.
i
believe
it
is
a
question
of
law.
and
when
you
have
this--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--it
was
based
on--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--it
was
based
on
an
assessment
of
two
things.
first,
the
district
court
said
based
upon
the
plaintiff's
testimony
and
the
exhibits,
and
the
court's
review
of
the
exhibits,
i
am
submitting
to
the
court
that
as
far
as
the
exhibits
are
concerned,
that
is
clearly
a
matter
of
law
whether
they
are
obscene
for
juveniles.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
well,
there
again,
they
never
really
said
what...
they
had
that
in
the
footnote.
they
just
threw
it
out
that
that
is
what
the
district
court
said,
but
if
you
read
the
actual
text
of
the
case,
they
didn't
accept
it.
they
just
said,
we
are
going
to
assume
this,
and
they
have
a
footnote,
and
the
footnote
says,
well,
the
district
court
says
this,
and
the
state
says
that.
they
never
say
the
district
court,
they
never
say
the
state
was
wrong,
they
just
say,
we
are
going
to
assume
it
is
based
on
what
happened
in
georgia,
which
is
a
completely
different
situation
than
virginia.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
which
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
get
to
with
justice
white,
as
far
as
the
evidence
presented,
it
was
based
on
the
testimony
of
two
bookstore
owners
who
admitted
on
cross
examination
that
they
didn't
have
the
faintest
idea
what
the
definitions
were.
all
of
their
testimony
as
to
all
of
the
material
affected
was
given
in
a
complete
vacuum.
there
was
no
basis
for
it.
there
was,
and
i
will,
if
i
could
for
just
a
moment,
this
is
indicative
of
both
testimony
directly
from
the
appendix,
and
it
will
be
very
short.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
for
the
disrict
court
to
find
that
the
exhibits
that
these
plaintiffs
presented
fell
within
the
amendment,
then
the
district
court
completely
misread
virginia
law,
because
none
of
their
exhibits
fall
within
the
statute.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
oh,
yes,
sir,
i
think
that
is
exactly
right,
they
failed
in
their
proof,
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
was
purposeful,
because
i
think
that
from
the
start
of
this
litigation,
it
is
a
lot
easier
if
you
are
going
into
a
federal
court
and
claiming
that
the
state
is
trying
to
restrict
james
joyce's
ulysses
than
it
is
to
go
in
and
say
the
state
is
trying
to
restrict
hustler.
and
i
cannot
imagine
any
other
reason
why
they
never
showed
their
own
witnesses
the
definitions
before
they
testified.
they
told
their
witnesses...
their
witnesses
came
in
with
a
group
of
books.
their
testimony
was,
and
questionings
from
the
plaintiffs,
do
you
think
that
any
book
with
a
picture
of
nudity
in
it
is
going
to
be
affected?
yes.
that
is
not
true.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
virginia
statute.
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
ruled,
just
like
this
court
has,
it
has
to
be
a
lewd
view
of
the
genitals,
not
mere
nudity,
and
this
permeated
their
testimony.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
i
am
sorry,
justice--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--they
have
ruled
with
respect
to
a
similar
statute.
they
had...
before
this
court
had
the
case
of
new
york
versus
ferber,
which
was
the
so-called
kiddie
porn
case,
virginia
had
essentially
that
same
case,
and
in
talking
about
what
is
obscene
for
juveniles,
the
virginia
supreme
court
expressly
held,
citing
miller
versus
california,
i
believe,
that
whether
it
is
adults
or
juveniles,
mere
nudity
cannot
be
obscene
for
juveniles.
that
case
is
cited
in
our
brief,
freeman
v.
commonwealth.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
mere
nudity
in
the
sense
of
just
a
picture
of
the
human
body.
they
went
on
to
say
that
the
nudity
has
to
be
a
lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals,
as
this
court
gave
as
the
example
in
miller
v.
california.
and
i
would
just
like
to
read,
if
i
can
get
back
to
the
record
just
for
a
moment,
it
is
a
question
to
their...
and
this
sums
up
their
entire
case
upon
which
this
is
based.
this
is
after
they
have
presented
all
of
the
books.
this
is
after
they
have
presented
all
of
their
evidence.
on
cross
examination
the
state's
lawyer
asked,
"question:
ms.
ross,
do
you
know
what
the
legal
definition
of
harmful
to
juveniles
is?
"
"answer:
no.
"
"question:
has
anyone
read
that
to
you?
"
"is
there
one?
"
"question:
no
one
ever
told
you
there
was
one,
did
they?
"
"answer:
i
don't
know.
"
"not
that
i
remember.
"
"what
is
the
legal
definition?
"
that
was
the
context
of
their
case
in
the
district
court.
taking
that--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--they
are
general
bookstores,
just
the
typical...
one
is
ampersand
books
in
alexandria,
and
the
other
one--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--yes,
their
exhibits
were
normal
books
that
might--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--i
am
asking
the
court
that
this
is
a
matter
of
law,
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
about
that,
that
none
of
their
exhibits--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--i
will
wager
this
case
on
one
exhibit,
plaintiff's
exhibit
no.
4,
the
penguin
book
of
love
poetry.
if
that
book
falls
within
this
statute,
then
we
concede
the
case.
you
don't
have
to
look
at
all
of
them.
just
look
at
that
one
book.
or
if
you
want
to
look
at
all
of
them,
the
same
thing
goes
for
all
of
them,
because
every
one
of
them--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--i
think
it
is
a
joint
question.
i
think
it
is
important
what
the
statute
means,
but
secondly,
i
think
the
number
is
important
as
far
as
these
plaintiffs
are
concerned,
because
they
have
built
their
whole
case
on
the
fact
that
there
is
such
a
large
amount
that
their
whole
case
on
the
fact
that
there
is
such
a
large
amount
of
material
involved.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
no,
because
then
i
would
suggest
this
court
has
no
problem
with
the
case,
because
then
you
would
know
you
were
dealing
with
borderline
obscenity
in
this
court
in
every
case
in
this
area
always
found
that
that
is...
the
periphery
of
the
first
amendment.
as
mr.
justice
stevens
said
in
young
v.
american
minitheaters,
there
is
very
little,
if
any,
interest
in
the
uninhibited
exhibition
of
that
type
of
material,
and
that
is
the
type
of
material
that
we
are
involved
in.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
well,
there
are
two
parts.
the
first
part
is
the
definitions
themselves.
the
definitions
in
section
18.2-390,
which
i
set
out
in
my
brief,
very
narrowly
define
types
of
sexual
activities
that
are
involved--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--they
are
the
definitions
of
the
material
involved
in
the
statute.
even
if
a
work
has
that
material,
it
is
still
not
within
the
statute.
it
still
has
to
be
harmful
to
juveniles,
and
that
is
what
the
eighth
circuit
said
in
the
upper
midwest
case
pushes
this
case
up
to
the
borderline
of
obscenity,
because...
and
i
will
give
you
a
quick
example.
in
young
v.
american
minitheaters,
those
bookstores
and
theaters
were
found
to
be
adult
bookstores
based
on
just
the
fact
of
the
type
of
sexual
material
they
involved,
sado-mashochistic
abuse,
lewd
nudity,
this
kind
of
thing.
those
types
of
materials
would
not
fall
under
this
statute,
because
you
have
to
go
a
step
further.
it
has
to
be
obscene
for
juveniles,
and
it
is
exactly
what
the
eighth
circuit
was
talking
about
in
the
upper
midwest
case
that
i
cited
in
the
brief.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
given
the...
interest
to
the
state
in
protecting
its
juveniles,
given
that
it
is
borderline
obscenity,
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
as
far
as
the
everyday
bookstore,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
but
one
of...
and
let
me
make
this
clear,
getting
back
to
what
justice
scalia
was
asking
earlier.
for
an
everyday
normal
bookstore
to
bar
juveniles
because
of
some
part
of
their
material,
a
miniscule
part,
would
be
devastating
for
them.
for
an
adult
bookstore
with
90
percent
books
borderline
obscenity,
who
cares?
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
not
take
it
all.
the
reason
we
didn't
ask
to
have
this
case
certified
below
was
because
this
court
now
has
a
tool
that
neither
the
district
court
had
nor
the
fourth
circuit
had.
virginia's
certification
procedure
only
became
effective
april
of
this
year.
there
was
no
certification
procedure
available.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
we
would
certainly
say
it
is.
yes,
sir.
it
is
effective...
it
was
effective
april
1st,
1987.
it
is
rule
5:42
of
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
it
is
very
comprehensive,
and,
justice
stevens,
i
won't
ask
that
just
we
agree
on
four
exhibits
be
sent
back,
you
send
every
exhibit
that
the
plaintiffs
put
into
evidence
below,
and
i
will
take
the
same
position
before
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
that
i
am
taking
here
that
not
one
of
those
falls
within
the
statute.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
portnoy's
complaint
was
not
an
exhibit.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
yes.
that
is
not
covered.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
that
is
not
covered.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
certainly.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
justice
stevens--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--if
you
would
look
at
section
18.2-391,
which
is
not
the
definitional
statute
but
the
actual
statute
under...
it
is
paragraph
2.
it
starts
off,
it
says,
"any
book,
pamphlet"--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--the
last
line
of
that
answers
the
question.
not
only
must
be
harmful
to
juveniles,
it
has
to
be
taken...
the
book
has
to
be
taken
as
a
whole,
just
as
with
this
case
you
cannot
pull
isolated
passages
out.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
well,
if
one
chapter
is
obscene,
and
then
the
other
nine...
or
obscene
for
juveniles,
and
the
other
nine
chapters
are
fine
for
juveniles,
would
that
book
fall
within
it?
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
that
is
where...
the
reason
hat
is
where
it
becomes
important
to
look
at
that...
what
i
just--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--the
part
i
pointed
you
to,
because
that
is
dealing
with
books.
if
we
are
talking
about
just
a
picture,
then
the
picture
in
itself
is
as
a
whole,
but
that
is
why
they
added
in
again,
taking...
in
other
words,
you
have
got...
with
respect
to
books,
you
have
got
two
taken
as
a
wholes.
not
only
you
have
taken
as
a
whole
as
far
as
harmful
to
juveniles,
but
the
book
as
itself
has
to
be
taken
as
a
whole.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
i
don't
think
it
would
under
either
way,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is,
this
is
the
virginia
version
of
miller
versus
california
as
it
relates
to
juveniles,
and
the
entire
work
has
to
be
taken
as
a
whole.
you
can't
pull
an
isolated
passage
out
of
the
book,
and
that
has
been
this
court's
jurisprudence
for
30
years,
and
that
is
what
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
always
followed.
you
can't
have
a
book
that
has...
and
that
is
what
happened
below.
they
would...
some
of
the
exhibits
there
would
be
a
vivid
description
of
a
rape
in
three
pages
out
of
700
pages,
and
that
doesn't
make
it
fall
within
the
statute.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
i
understand,
and--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--no,
and
perhaps
the
easiest...
or
the
reason
for
it
is
that
under
virginia
law
this
is
a
criminal
statute,
and
has
to
be
strictly
construed
against
the
commonwealth.
in
any
type
of
disagreement
like
that,
the
state
loses.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
exact
example
took
place
in
this
case.
one
of
the
bookstore
owners
said
that
she
had
some
material
that
she
thought
might
be
adult
material,
and
she
said,
"but
i
keep
it
on
a
shelf
next
to
my
counter,
where
i
keep
an
eye
on
it
so
juveniles
can't
get
to
it.
"
of
course
that
complies,
because
the
state
has
to
prove
that
she
syinterly...
we
have
to
prove
that
she
knowingly
violated
the
statute.
mr.
richard
bain
smith
because
i
think--
mr.
richard
bain
smith
--this
court
had
a
case
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
called
the
foreign
products
case,
and
that
case
said
that
when
used
in
a
statute
as
this
"may"
is
used,
it
can...
mean
might
or
it
can
mean
reasonable
certainty
or
it
can
mean
actual
tendency
under
virginia
law,
since
it
has
to
be
strictly
construed
against
the
commonwealth,
it
has
to
be
what
you
have
suggested,
and
it
would
qualify.
