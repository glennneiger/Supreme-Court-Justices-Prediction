mr.
paul
m.
bator
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
butler
v.
michigan
this
court
announced
a
fundamental
first
amendment
rule,
one
from
which
it
has
never
deviated.
the
states
are
not
free
to
place
substantial
restrictions
on
the
access
of
adults
to
books
and
magazines
that
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
even
if
the
purpose
of
the
protection
is
to
safeguard
children.
our
central
submission
today
is
that
the
virginia
nude
display
statute
on
its
face
violates
this
fundamental
principle,
because
unlike
the
preexisting
sales
statute,
which
had
no
impact
whatever
on
adults,
this
statute
requires
booksellers
immediately
to
place
important
new
restrictions
on
adult
access
to
books
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
it
places
an
immediate
and
affirmative
obligation
on
booksellers
to
screen
their
inventory,
to
reorganize
their
displays,
and
to
purge
from
their
shelves,
where
books
are
freely
and
readily
available,
all
books
that
have
enough
sexually
explicit
materials
in
them
that
they
are
not
suitable
for
sale
to
children.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
would
involve
a
very
substantial
restriction
on
the
access
of
the
adults.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons
why
that
would
be
very
difficult
or
onerous
for
adults.
first
of
all,
books
are
sold
in
large
numbers
of
places
which
are
not
bookstores.
we
have
newsstands,
we
have
bookstands
in
supermarkets,
at
airport
and
drugstore
counters.
they
can't
have
two
different
sections.
it
really
is
not
feasible
for
them
to
have
an
adult
section.
secondly,
the
district
court--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--yes.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
we
represent
really
the
whole
gamut
of
booksellers
and
distributors,
including
those,
your
honor.
now,
another
problem
with--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
our
clients
do
not
include
any
adult
or
porno
bookstores
whatever.
we
do
have
two
20
to--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--yes,
the
testimony
below
was
very
clear.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
statutory
definition
under
the
virginia
display
statute.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
justice
o'connor.
we
have
testimony
in
the
record,
very
clear
testimony
in
the
affidavits
as
well
as
in
the
oral
testimony
on
the
part
of
these
bookstore
owners
that
they
understood
the
statute
to
cover
somewhere
between
25
to
40
percent
of--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--no,
your
honor,
because
i
think
the
statute
covers
a
large
amount
of
material.
the
statute
covers
a
large
amount
of
material
that
does
not
fall
into
this
classification
of
what
do
we
mean
by
is
it
porno,
but
that
does
have
some
sexually
explicit
material.
i
go
back
to
both
questions,
because
i
want
to
be
able
to
cover
it.
your
honor,
these
booksellers
are,
of
course,
not
lawyers,
but,
of
course,
they
are
the
ones
who
have
to
deal
with
this
statute.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
i
think
the
witnesses
testified
that
they
read
the
statute,
but
i
think
they
read
them
as
an
ordinary
nonlawyer
would
read
them,
and
they
gave
an
explanation
of
how
they
would
understand
this
statute,
and
of
course
that
is
the
perspective
that
is
important.
they
understood
this
statute
to
cover
a
substantial
amount
of
their
inventory.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
i
believe,
and
this
now
goes
again
to
justice
scalia's
question
as
well,
that
it
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
understanding
of
the
statute
and
really
just
what
this
statute
suggests
that
if
you
think
that
a
book
is
unsuitable
for
sale
to
13-year-old
you
may
not
display
it
in
your
bookstore.
now,
that
does
not
just
include
porno.
that
includes
a
large
range
of
material
which
i
would
be
rather
averse
to
having
a
13-year-old
child
of
mine
buy
a
in
a
bookstore,
and
that
very
much
includes
a
large
range
of
popular
as
well
as
literary
works.
now,
we
do
have
a
district
court
finding
on
this.
that
is
to
say,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
attorney
general
has
here
said
everything
turns
on
what
this
statute
encompasses.
but
we
have
two
courts
below
that
made
findings
on
that
issue.
the
district
court
said
they...
the
district
court
didn't
accept
the
testimony
completely.
it
lowered
the
percentage.
the
district
court
made
its
own
judgment.
it
said
somewhere
between
5
and
25
percent
of
the
inventory
of
the
non-adult
bookshop
is
likely
to
be
covered
here.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
district
court
made
a
finding,
and
it
is
on
page
a...
on
page
a20,
third
full
paragraph.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
a20
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
the
court
concludes
that
the
average
general
bookstore
carriers
a
significant
percentage
of
materials
varying
between
5
and
10
percent
that
are
harmful
to
juveniles
as
defined
by--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--no,
your
honor,
i
honestly
believe
the
record
would
not
support
that
conclusion.
these
are
ordinary
bookshops.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
but
the
record
is
replete
with
descriptions
of
what
these
bookstores
are,
and
i
hope
very
much...
the
women
who
owned
these
bookstores
gave
very
vivid
and
interesting
testimony
about
what
it
is
like
to
run
an
ordinary
bookshop
in
alexandria
or
arlington.
these
are
the
opposite
of
porno
bookshops.
now,
the
district
court
finding
was
based
in
the
context
of
these
bookshops
and
the
exhibits
and
the
affidavits
and
the
testimony,
and--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
am
sorry.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
the
district
judge
made
his
own
finding
based
not
only
on
the
testimony,
but
the
affidavits
and
the
exhibits.
the
court
of
appeals
was
very
careful
not
to
disturb
that
finding,
although
it
did
say
that
the
testimony
is
such
that
it
is
very
hard
to
guess
the
exact
percentage.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
seems
to
me...
again,
this
goes
really
to
the
interchange
i
had
with
justice
o'connor.
that
is,
it
is
terribly
important
to
understand
that
the
life
of
this
statute
plays
itself
out
not
at
the
level
of
constitutional
theory
or
lawyers'
interpretation.
it
plays
itself
out
between
the
local
bookshop
and
the
local
community,
and
that
bookshops's
fear
of
arrest
and
prosecution
by
the
local
attorney,
commonwealth
attorney
and
the
local
police.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
our
point
is
not
that
it
is
impossible
to
comply,
but
that
the
effect
of
good
faith
compliance
is
likely
to
be
a
very
drastic
restriction
on
the
free
access
of
adults
to
these
books.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
suppose
a
bookstore
could
have
a
children
only
section.
the
real
question
is
whether
if
you
want
to
read
a
popular
work
or
browse
or
look
at
a
popular
work
of
literature
in
an
ordinary
neighborhood
bookstore,
whether
you
have
to
enter
a
section
that
is
labeled
x,
labeled
adults
only.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--your
honor,
i
feel
like
the
hockey
goalie
who
has
pucks
coming
from
all
sides.
0
[generallaughter.]
your
honor,
on
the
question
of
the
deterrence,
again
we
have...
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
went
into
that,
and
there
was
testimony.
the
problem
here
is
that
the
sale
of
books
is
very
much
affected
by
display,
that
is
to
say
a
large
proportion
of
books
are
sold
to
people
who
aren't
planning
to
go
but
who
go
in
to
read,
to
browse,
and
they
come
upon
a
book
they
rather
like,
so
it
is
a
very
sensitive
area.
the
district
court
found
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
deterrent
to
adults...
i
understand
that
that
doesn't
deal
with
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical,
but
if
it
says
x
rated,
adults
only,
a
lot
of
people
are
going
to
stay
out
because
they
are
embarrassed,
and
they
don't
want...
these
are
not
people
in
porno
bookshops.
these
are
people
in
ordinary
bookshops.
the
fact
is...
this
is
not
of
record,
and
it
is
just
based
on
my
new
york
times
reading,
but
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
movie
industry
as
well,
even
though
movies
are
different
because
people
plan
to
go
to
a
movie,
it
is
not
an
impulse
thing,
but
an
x
rating
on
a
movie,
as
i
understand
it,
is
thought
to
be
commercial
disaster,
but
there
is
another
point
here,
your
honor,
that
i
want
to
stress
before
i
get
back
to
the
other
side
of
the
bench.
there
would
be
an
enormous
change
in
the
general
ambience
and
atmosphere
of
bookshops
if
what
we
have
is
an
adult
section,
x
only,
and
a
children's
section,
children
only.
that
is
to
say,
the
whole
atmosphere
of
a
bookstore
that
we
know...
every
one
of
us
has
been
in
a
bookstore
on
saturday
afternoon,
and
really
that
is
what
this
case
is
about,
is
what
kind
of
bookstores
do
we
want?
do
we
want
a
bookstore
where
every
book
or
every
shelf
is
labeled
with
a
government
seal
of
approval
or
a
government
seal
of
disapproval?
that
is
the
issue
in
this
lawsuit.
the
fact
is
that
the
life
of
the
bookstore
is
free
circulation
for
browsing,
and
that
is
what
we
think
the
statute
badly
inhibits.
now,
there
is
another
problem,
justice
o'connor.
there
is
a
large
number
of
books
where
it
would
be
disastrous
to
say
children
only.
i
mean,
i
guess
i
don't
even
know
quite
what
that
would
mean,
because
there
are
a
lot
of
books
that
are
absolutely
proper
for
kids
and
for
grown-ups
and
they
are
just
general
books.
i
don't
think
we
can
reorganize
the
bookshops,
this
world
of
books
and
of
intellect
in
terms
of
these
tight
rules,
and
really,
i
think
our
question
is
whether
it
is
constitutional
for
the
government
basically
to
create
an
across
the
board
rating
system
for
books,
and
there
is
a
great--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
think
that
would
be
a
more
difficult
case,
although
that
also
would
create
a
tremendous
problem
for
booksellers.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
if
the
crime
were
for
the
booksellers
to
allow
kids,
i
think
there
would
be
a
very
serious
first
amendment
problem,
very
much
the
same
sort
that
the
court
had
in
the
smith
case,
because
the
effect
even
of
that
statute
would
be
to
put
pressure
on
the
bookseller
to
self-censor.
the
vice
of
this
statute,
and
i
think
the
problem
that
the
attorney
general
has
absolutely
never
confronted,
is
that
this--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--if
the
bookseller
looks
at
the
statute,
even
in
the
version
justice
o'connor
gives,
and
decides
the
only
safe
thing
to
do
here
is
if
it
has
sex
in
it,
put
it
under
the
counter
or
put
it
in
an
x-ray
separate
section,
that
is
the
burden
on
the
adult.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
would
be
very
problematic
your
honor.
i
think
that
a
lot
of
adults
would
find
that
intensely
uncomfortable
because
it
really
labels
them.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
beg
your
pardon?
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
paul
m.
bator
they
are
not.
they
are
not
minors.
i
think
in
this
world
everybody
knows
what
that
is
all
about,
and
it
would
be
a
very
radical
departure
from
our
traditions
of
what
bookstores
are
supposed
to
be
like.
if
the
statute
as
we
argue
applies
to
a
large
range
of
perfectly
ordinary
literary,
serious
and
popular
works,
the
point
about
hollywood
wives,
justice
o'connor,
is
not
for
us
to
wrangle
about
whether
it
is
covered
or
not,
but
if
hollywood
wives
is
covered,
then
there
are
hundreds
of
ordinary
best
sellers,
potboilers
of
every
sort
that
are
covered
here,
and
in
a
sense
they
ought
to
be
covered.
that
is
to
say,
there
are
a
lot
of
books
that
we
do
not
want
the
bookseller
to
sell
to
a
12-year-old,
and
the
vice
of
this
statute
is,
if
you
don't
want
it
sold
to
a
12-year-old,
you
have
got
to
remove
it
from
the
shelf.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
does
put
a
burden
on
the
bookstore--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--we
have
two
answers
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
we
think
that
the
burden
on
the
bookseller
in
the
case
of
the
display
statute
is
more
onerous,
because
you
have
to
do
this
advance
screening
of
the
whole
inventory,
but
the
really
important
point
is
that
complying
with
the
burden
in
the
display
context
is
much
more
dangerous
to
the
first
amendment
because
it
restricts
the
access
of
adults.
complying
with
the
burden
with
respect
to
sales
has
no
impact
on
adults
at
all.
but
if
you
remove
a
book
from
the
shelf,
the
easily
accessible
shelf,
because
you
are
afraid
of
a
kid
coming
upon
it,
you
have
also
removed
it
from
the
adult.
there
is
another
point
i
would
like--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--the
statute
does
apply
to
both.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
more
difficult
case,
and
it
is
not
our
case,
and
i
would
hope
very
much
that
the
court
would
not
on
this
record
and
with
these
briefs
try
to
answer
that
question.
our
position
would,
however,
be,
if
you
push
me
to
the
corner
of
saying,
that
the
court's
cases
do
not
support
and
the
first
amendment
should
not
support
a
lesser
protection
for
pictures
than
for
text,
but
that's--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--not
a
constitutional
right
to
buy,
but
the
access
problem--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
think
is
more
difficult,
but
of
course
the
important
point
here
is
that
that
is
not
what
virginia
has
done.
it
seems
to
me
we
really
have
to
focus
on
what
virginia
has
done.
virginia
should
not
be
allowed
to
have
it
both
ways.
that
is,
they
have
drafted
a
statute
that
at
least
from
the
perspective
of
the
bookseller
is
sensibly
and,
as
the
district
court
said,
consensitively
viewed
as
a
broad
statute
that
encompasses
any
material
that
has
enough
sex
in
it
so
you
don't
want
it
sold
to
a
kid.
now,
they--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
think,
justice
o'connor,
they
have
read
the
statute,
but
when
they
were
cross-examined,
these
were
women
who
were
not
used
to
the
business
of
tight
cross
examination
at
law,
and
when
they
were
cross
examined
on
detail,
they
were
vague
on
the
detail,
but
that
is
the
real
world.
that
is
how
this
statute
is
going
to
operate
in
the
real
world.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
a
sensible
bookseller
in
the
local
community
faced
with
the
possibility
of
local
police
and
local
prosecutors
would
read
the
statute
that
way.
the
statute
prescribes
display.
it
says
any
display.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
read
the
"knowingly"
in
light
of
his
definition
again
in
the
virginia
statute.
i
think
the
bookseller
can't
just
sit
back
and
say
i
don't
know
anything.
i
think
what
they
have
to
do
is
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
comply,
and
compliance
here
means
compliance
with
rules
about
display
that
may
give
access
to
juveniles.
now,
if
the
statute...
we
are
constantly
dealing
a
little
bit
here
with
two
possible
statutes.
i
would
really
like
to
say
that
virginia
can't
and
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
have
it
both
ways.
that
is
what
they
do
is,
they
draft
a
statute
that
is
broad
enough
so
that
the
bookseller
is
under
pressure
to
self-censor
and
to
comply
broadly.
and
then
the
attorney
general
comes
in
here
and
says,
oh,
no,
no,
no,
this
statute
is--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--there
was,
your
honor.
the
district
court
found
it
is
not
an
appropriate
case
for
abstaining.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
we
have
not
in
any
way
agreed
that...
in
fact,
we
do
not
think
the
law
would
permit
abstention
here.
now,
the
attorney
general
did
not--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--there
is
no
readily
available
narrowing
construction
here.
the
attorney
general
has
not
come
up
with
a
standard
here.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
does,
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
do
not
think
that
there
would
be
a
meaningful
question
that
could
be
certified.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
don't
think
a
meaningful
question
could
be
certified
on
that
because
the
attorney
general
himself
has
not
come
up
with
an
intelligible
standard.
i
mean,
what
he
said
is
miniscule.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
paul
m.
bator
in
the
district
court
there
was
a
motion
made.
we
opposed
it.
i
don't--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--oh,
no
motion
to
certify,
just
to
abstain.
now,
i
think
the
abstention
point
was
abandoned
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
pursue
it.
and
i
don't
think
it
was
pursued
in
any
question
to
this
court.
we
did
brief
the
question
because
we
thought
that
it
was
an
important
problem
in
the
case.
whether
the
court
should
say,
well,
let's
wait
and
see,
somehow
see
what
the
state
courts
say,
but
we
think
that
would
be
inappropriate.
the
bookseller
can't
wait
and
see.
the
bookseller
has
to
comply
now.
and
the
fundamental
problem
is
that
this
so-called
miniscule
construction
has
really
no
content.
that
is,
the
attorney
general
has
not
come
up
with
an
intelligible
standard
for
what
this
so-called
narrow
construction
is.
the
court's
cases--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--no,
we
read
that
as
being
very
broad,
and
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
read
it
as
being
broad,
and
it
would
be
really
unprecedented
for
this
court
to
reverse
two
courts
on
that
issue
of
state
law.
that
would
be
quite
an
unprecedented
thing
for
the
court
to
do,
is
to
reverse
two
courts
on
the
meaning
of
a
state
statute
on
which
they
have
agreed.
i
want
to
finish
one
thought
if
i--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--well,
i--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
think
their
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
implicit
in
what
they
understood
the
impact
of
the
statute
to
be,
that
is,
it
is
implicit
in
their
description
of
what
this
statute
does
to
the
ordinary
bookshop
under
the
threat
of
prosecution
and
punishment
by
the
local
police
and
local
prosecutor.
i
mean,
what
we...
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
one
thought
i
have
been
trying
to
get
out
that
i
would
like
to
get
out
here,
that
we
are
talking
about
the
first
amendment.
we
are
talking
about
the
butler
rule,
which
places
a
very
serious
rule
against
the
state
in
doing
things
that
can
have
an
impact
on
adults.
now,
virginia
passes
this
broad
statute
which
the
consensus
of
the
testimony
and
the
finding
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
places
a
substantial
burden
on
adults.
now,
the
attorney
general
comes
in
here
and
says,
no,
no,
this
statute
is
a
paper
tiger.
i
don't
think
that
counts
as
the
kind
of
narrowing
construction
that
this
court
said
can
save
an
overly
broad
statute.
that
is
what
this
court
should
not
do,
is
allow
the
statute
to
be
reinterpreted
on
the...
because
the
attorney
general
comes
in
here
and
sort
of
says,
well,
we
are
not
going
to
enforce
this
statute
against
any
respectable
bookshop.
anyway,
it
is
not
the
attorney
general
who
enforces
the
criminal
law
of
virginia,
it
is
the
local
commonwealth
attorneys.
this
statute
places
a
serious
burden
of
self-censorship
on
the
bookshops,
and
complying
with
that
burden
we
feel
will
place
a
very
substantial
inhibition
on
what
grown-ups
have
always
done,
freely
go
to
a
bookshop,
browse
in
the
bookshop,
and
decide
what
they
want
to
read,
decide
what
they
want
to
buy,
and
that
impact
on
adults,
which
doesn't
exist
at
all
in
a
sales
situation
we
think
is
the
fundamental
vice
of
this
statute.
self-censorship
leading
to
an
access
burden
on
adults
is
what
makes
this
statute
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment.
like
the
battered
hockey
goalie,
i
will
now
retire
unless
there
are
questions.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
am
sorry,
justice
stevens.
you
will
have
to--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
suppose
you
could
frame
an
abstention
or
a
certification
based
on
one
or
two
or
three
books.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
suppose
that
there
is
a
disagreement
about
portnoy's
complaint,
which
is
not
a
book
i
would
like
to
have
sold
to
a
12-year-old,
and
which
i
think
is
clearly
covered,
and
i
guess
the
attorney
general
says
today
that
it
is
not
covered,
but
suppose...
suppose
the
virginia
supreme
court
tells
us
it
is
covered
or
not
covered.
is
that
the
kind
of
intelligible
narrowing
construction
of
the
statute?
that
is
to
say,
it
is
a
single
book,
and
this
court's
cases
make
it
very
clear
that
a
whole
series
of
litigations
to
narrow
a
statute
are
not
sufficient.
there
has
to
be
a
quick
cure.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
it
would
make
a
difference,
but
we
do
not
think
it
would
save
the
statute.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
do
not
think
it
would
save
the
statute,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
juveniles
also
have
a
constitutional
right
of
access
to
books.
i
mean,
that
is
a
major
problem.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
so
again
what
you
would
have
to
do
is,
you
would
have
to
reorganize
the
entire
display
of
the
bookshop
and
you
would
have
books
that
are
for
everybody,
and
some
just
for
kids,
and
just
some
for
adults,
and
we
think
that
that
would
produce
a
major
change
in
the
first
amendment
spirit
of
how
bookstores
are
run.
