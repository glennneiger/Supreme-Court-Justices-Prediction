justice

day

mr.
smith,
did
the
state
concede
at
the
appellate
level
below
that
books
such
as
hollywood
wives
would
be
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
is
your
point,
that
the
appellees
had
no
standing
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
are
we
supposed
to
decide
that,
by
looking
at
the
words
of
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
those
are
the
definitions
of
what
is
harmful
to
juveniles?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
appellees
below,
mr.
bator,
make
a
claim
that
they
sold
books
that
met
the
definition
of
what
is
harmful
to
juveniles?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
well,
but
did
the...
your
clients,
did
they
claim
that
they
display
routinely
books
which
meet
the
statutory
definition
of
harmful
to
juveniles?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
did
their
testimony
take
into
account
the
actual
statutory
definition,
which
does
seem
to
be
much
more
restrictive
than
the
testimony
would
indicate
they
thought
it
was?
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
what
the
state's
attorney
is
arguing.
or,
to
put
it
differently,
mr.
bator,
if
your
clients
indeed
have
40
percent
of
books
that
meet
this
definition,
i
think
you
are
inaccurate
to
say
that
they
are
not
porno
stores.
i
think
it
is
incredible
that
anybody
could
come
within
this...
40
percent
within
this
definition
is
very
high,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
apparently
they
had
not
read
the
statute
when
they
testified.
now,
this
definition
defines
it
exactly
as
the
court
has
in
miller,
only
refined
down
to
juveniles,
predominantly
appeals
to
the
prurient,
shameful,
or
morbid
interest
of
juveniles,
is
patently
offensive
to
prevailing
standards
and
the
adult
community
as
a
whole
with
respect
to
what
is
suitable
material
for
juveniles,
and
when
taken
as
a
whole
lacking
in
serious
literary,
artistic,
political,
or
scientific
value
for
juveniles.
did
the
testimony
and
the
witnesses
have
in
mind
that
precise
definition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
as
i
looked
at
it,
the
ordinary
books
like
ulysses
and
other
things
that
i
would
think
of
clearly
wouldn't
fit
within
this
definition,
so
i
am
just
wondering
whether
we
have
two
ships
passing
in
the
night
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bator,
could
the
bookstore
set
up
a
children's
only
section,
not
an
adults
only,
but
a
children's
only
section,
so
that
people
who
are
affected
are
the
children,
not
the
adults?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
had
a
children's
only
section
you
wouldn't
have
to
do
that
as
an
adult.
mr.
bator,
if
every
store
had
an
adults
only
section,
as
you
tell
us
would
be
necessary
if
all
bookstores
have
large
quantities
of
these
books,
do
you
really
think
it
would
be
a
great
disincentive
for
adults
to
go
into
that
section?
have
they
stayed
away
from
the
movies
in
droves
when
they
have
adults
only
films?
why
would
their
reaction
to
general
adults
only
sections
in
bookstores
be
any
different?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bator,
what
if
the
statute
just
said
it
prohibited
allowing
juveniles
to
peruse
and
examine
material
that
is
harmful
to
them?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
a
burden
on
the
adults,
would
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
concede
that
the
statute,
the
old
statute
that
prohibited
selling
the
items
to
juveniles
is
constitutional--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yet
surely
that
is
a
burden
on
the
bookstore
owner.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
why
is
it
a
substantially
different
burden
to
say
you
won't
allow
juveniles
to
peruse
the
material
that
you
can't
sell
to
them?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
it
just
to
apply
the
definitions
as
they
are
written
in
the
statute
for
what
is
harmful
to
juveniles?
that
is
pretty
narrow.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bator,
would
it
make
a
difference
if
the
court
said
the
statute
was
complied
with
if
the
bookstore
owner
just
said
juveniles
were
not
permitted
to
browse?
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
is
a
certifiable
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they
don't
have
a
right
of
access
to
books
that
are
harmful
to
minors
within
the
meaning
of
this
definition,
do
they?
