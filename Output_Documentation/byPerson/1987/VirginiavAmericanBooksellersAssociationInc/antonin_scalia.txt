justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
call
that
a
finding
of
fact,
mr.
smith?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
that
is
a
finding
of
fact?
whether,
what
books
in
a
store
are
covered
by
a
particular
statute?
that
is
just
a
factual
finding?
that
is
all
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
to
take
whatever
the
district
court
says
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
know
how
many
cows
there
are
in
virginia?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
not
talking
about
what
is
obscene.
i
am
talking
about
what
the
statute
covers.
is
that
a
question
of
fact,
what
books
the
statute
covers,
whether
obscene
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
percentage
is
really
not
that
consequential
of
that
percentage
is
derived
by
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute,
as
you
say
it
is
proper,
then
there
wouldn't
be
anything
horrible
about
coming
down
on
the
bookstore
that
happens
to
have
20
percent
of
it
or
25
percent
of
it.
it
is
important
from
this
context.
they
came
up
with
all
these
horrible
ways,
the
only
ways
they
could
comply
with
the
statute,
and
one
of
which
was
borrowing...
totally
barring
juveniles
from
their
bookstore.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
if
you
are
talking
about
a
normal
everyday
bookstore,
barring
juveniles
from
that
bookstore
because
of
supposedly
this
large
amount
of
material
would
be
devastating.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
borrowing
juveniles
from
an
adult
bookstore
that
has
90
percent
of
the
inventory
that
is
borderline
obscenity
would
not
be
the
kind
of
burden
that
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
the
cases
dealing
with
this
type
of
situation.
what
is
the
narrowing
language
in
the
statute
that
you
think
was
not
adequately
considered
by
the
courts
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
far
as
the
testimony
goes,
mr.
bator,
it
is
not
worth
a
whole
lot
if
it
comes
from
people
who
haven't
read
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
as
far
as
the
testimony
is
concerned,
it
is
not
worth
a
whole
lot
if
it
was
testimony
by
people
that
hadn't
read
the
statute
that
they
purported
to
be
applying
to
the
books.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
that,
mr.
bator,
unless
you
are
talking
about
a
bookseller,
as
some
of
your
witnesses
were,
who
hadn't
read
the
statute.
if
you
read
the
statute,
this
covers
very
offensive
material,
but
only
very
offensive
material.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bator,
may
i
follow
up
on
justice
o'connor's
question
about
whether
the
statute
would
be
all
right
if
it
merely
prohibited
permitting
juveniles
to
browse
as
opposed
to
requiring
you
to
segregate
materials
in
a
fashion
so
that
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
browse?
do
we
have
any
reason...
is
it
clear
that
the
statute
requires
any
more
than
that?
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
unlawful
act
it
says
"it
shall
be
unlawful
to
knowingly
display
for
commercial
purpose
in
a
manner
whereby
juveniles
may
examine
and
peruse.
"
now,
"may"
could
well
mean
two
things.
it
could
mean
it
is
possible
for
them
to
do
so
or
it
could
mean
it
is
permitted
for
them
to
do
so,
so
it
may
well
be
that
all
that
is
necessary
under
the
statute
is
a
sign
in
the
store
that
says
juveniles
not
permitted
to
browse.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
also
has
a
definition
of
"knowingly"
which
seems
to
suggest,
and
knowingly,
it
says
"knowing
display",
the
definition
of
"knowingly"
says
that
you
have
to
know
or
have
reason
to
know
the
age
of
the
juvenile.
now,
that
suggests
that
there
has
to
be
some
concrete
occasion
in
which
the
juvenile
is
being
allowed
to
browse,
and
you
have
reason
to
know
what
his
age
is.
isn't
that
a
permissible
reading?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
mr.
bator.
where
do
the
courts
describe
the
meaning
of
it?
where
do
they
describe
the
meaning
of
it,
that
we
would
be
reversing
their
description
of
the
meaning
of
the
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
opposed
to
just
saying
it
covers
40
percent
of
all
books--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
am
not
talking
so
much
about
knowingly
as
i
am
talking
about
the
language
"display
for
a
commercial
purpose
in
a
manner
whereby
juveniles
may
examine
and
peruse.
"
"may"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--"may"
means
it
is
possible
for
them
to
do
so
or
they
are
permitted
to
do
so.
