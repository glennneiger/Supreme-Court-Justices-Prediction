chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-1034,
virginia
v.
american
booksellers
association.
mr.
smith,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
ask
the
district
court
to
abstain
in
order
to
obtain
construction
of
this
from
the
virginia
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
did
you
raise
that
question
in
the
fourth
circuit,
the
district
court's
failure
to
abstain?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
those
are
two
quite
different
points.
so
you
didn't
preserve
the
abstention
argument,
did
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that...
they
passed
on
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
order
to
decide
what
percentage
of
one's
inventory
is
affected
by
a
statute,
you
need
to
know
first
what
the
inventory
consists
of,
and
second,
what
the
statute
means,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
want
to
look
at
any
of
them.
you
are
basically
arguing
that
the
statute
has
a
narrower
meaning
than
the
lower
court
said,
and
presumably
it
could
affect
80
percent
of
the
books
in
a
pornographic
bookstore
or
2
percent
of
the
books
in
a
regular.
the
percentage
of
books
affected
across
the
board
isn't
so
important.
it
is
what
the
statute
means
in
terms
of
our
decided
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
suppose
there
were
a
bunch
of
people
that
concededly
deal
in
pornography.
would
it
make
much
of
a
case
for
them
to
come
in
and
say,
look,
this
statute
restricting
juvenile
access
affects
90
percent
of
our
books?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
bator.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
couldn't
you
just
have
an
adults
only
part
of
the
bookstore?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
couldn't
you
just
have
an
adults
only
part
of
the
bookstore?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
you'd
be
restricting
would
be
juveniles,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
they
members
of
your...
are
people
like
that
members
of
your
organization?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
airport
bookstands?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
give
its
opinion
as
to
precisely
what
the
statute
meant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a20--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--now,
that
could
mean
two
different
things,
couldn't
it?
it
could
mean
that
these
bookstores
are
really
then
quite
different
than
you
have
characterized
them
because
they
carry
material
that
is
much
like
that
described
in
the
miller
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
this
finding
tells
you
is
that
a
certain
percentage
of
the
books
in
the
store
are
covered
by
the
statute.
now,
to
me
that
doesn't
militate
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
the
statute
is
good
or
bad,
because
it
depends
on
what
the
inventory
of
the
bookstore
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
being
peppered
with
questions
from
both
sides.
just
take
your
time
and
answer
them,
and
hope
in
the
future
they
will
be
asked
one
at
a
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
you
object
to
a
motion
to
abstain
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
oppose
the
motion--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
the
state
to
abstain?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
you
could
have
gotten
a
conclusive
construction
of
the
statute
by
abstention,
a
statute
which
we
are
now
arguing
about
the
meaning
of.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bator.
mr.
smith,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
86-1034,
virginia
versus
american
booksellers
association
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
