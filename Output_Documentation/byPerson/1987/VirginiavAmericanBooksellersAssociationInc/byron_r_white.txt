where
did
this
case
come
from,
what
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
those
courts
have
some
view
of
the
breadth,
the
reach
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
must
have
had
some
notion
of
what
the
reach
was
to
do
what
they
did
to
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
they
thought
it
was
much
broader
than
you
say
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right
or
not?
did
they
view
it
much
more
broadly
than
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
still
don't
answer
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
breadth
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
assume
that
if
we
found
that
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court...
the
court
of
appeals
defined
this
statute
more
broadly
than
you
do,
we
might
very
well
take
the
court
of
appeals
view
of
what
the
meaning
of
a
state
statute
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
court
of
appeals
take
the
broad
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
district
court's
finding
that
this
statute
would
affect
a
certain
percentage
of
the
materials
in
the
bookstores?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
it
accepted
a
finding
that
from
5
to
50
percent.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
district
court
found
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
it
is
25
percent,
you
lose.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
certainly
has
to
be
based
on
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
a
court
isn't
going
to
find
what
percentage
of
books
in
a
bookstore
are
covered
by
the
statute
without...
even
if
it
knows
what
the
statute
means,
it
has
got
to
know
what
books
are
in
the
store.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
so
say
it
is
a
matter
of
law.
then
what
do
we
do
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
to
the
district
court's
statement
of
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
also
there
are
suggesting
that
the
plaintiffs
who
tried
this
case,
those
lawyers
really
didn't
understand
what
was
going
on,
that
they
really
failed
in
their
proof.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
ever
just
describe
what
kind
of
books
were
in
these
stores?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
they
say...
did
they
describe
what
kind
of
books
they
had
in
their
stores?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
the
district
court
looked
at
those
books,
then
read
the
statute,
and
decided
that
x
percent
of
those
books
in
that
store
would
be
covered.
now,
let's
just
assume
the
district
court
went
through
that
routine.
you
are
asking
us
to
disagree
with
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
means,
i
suppose,
then
we
have
to
really
look
at...
go
through
the
exhibits,
look
at
the
evidence,
and
then
decide
what
the
statute
means
and
say...
you
want
us
to
say
then
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
were
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
your
argument
on
this
percentage
business,
isn't
it
that
you
are
contending
that
this
statute
has
only
a
de
minimis
consequence
to
these,
the
people
who...
the
plaintiff,
the
plaintiffs'
bookstores?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore
it
really
is
sort
of
a
miniscule
burden
to
cause
them
to
go
through
the
steps
to
comply
with
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
affects
a
much
larger
percentage,
you
seem
to
agree
that
the
steps
they
would
have
to
go
through
would
be
too
burdensome.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
hard
core
bookstores?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
hard
core
bookstores?
justice
byron
r.
white
--of
the
exact
percentage
anyway.
it
is
then...
that
is
just
to...
as
a
predicate
for
inquiring
how
much
of
a
burden
it
is
on
adults
or
within
the
bookstore.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
is
not
impossible
to
comply
with
the
statute,
no
matter
how
much
percentage
of
the
books,
and
your
submission
is,
and
i
guess
it
was
taken
below,
that
none
of
these
ways
of
complying
would
remove
the
burden
on
adults.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
it
would
avoid
the
burden
on
the
adults.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
burden
would
be
to
saying
if
you
had
a
separate
section
in
the
bookstore
that
said
minors
not
allowed?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
not
minors?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
not
minors.
it
labels
them
that
way.
