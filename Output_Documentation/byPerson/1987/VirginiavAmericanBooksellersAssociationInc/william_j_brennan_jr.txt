this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
united
states
district
court
in
virginia
and
affirmed
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
declared
unconstitutionally
following
virginia
statute.
“it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
knowingly
display
for
commercial
purposes
in
a
manner
whereby
juveniles
may
examine
and
peruse
visual
or
written
material
that
depicts
sexually
explicit
nudity,
sexual
conduct
or
sadomasochistic
abuse
and
which
is
harmful
to
juveniles."
the
unique
factual
and
procedural
setting
of
this
case
leads
us
to
conclude
that
an
authoritative
construction
of
this,
this
virginia
statute
by
the
virginia
supreme
court,
would
substantially
aid
our
review
of
this
constitutional
holding
and
might
well
determine
the
case
entirely.
accordingly,
we
have
concluded
that
we
should
not
attempt
to
review
the
holding
at
this
time
but
should
certify
first
two
questions
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
that
court
has
a
certification
procedure
embodied
in
its
rule
5:42
that
authorizes
our
submission.
and
pursuant
to
the
rule,
we
respectfully
certify
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
the
following
questions.
first,
does
the
phrase,
"harmful
to
juveniles"
is
used
and
the
virginia
code
properly
construed
encompass
any
of
the
books
introduced
as
plaintiffs'
exhibits
below
and
what
general
standard
should
be
used
to
determine
the
statute's
reach
in
light
of
juveniles'
differing
ages
and
levels
of
maturity.
and
a
second
question,
what
meaning
is
to
be
given
to
the
provision
of
the
virginia
code
making
it
unlawful
and,
“to
knowingly
display
for
commercial
purposes
in
a
manner
whereby
juveniles
may
examine
or
peruse
certain
materials?”
specifically,
is
the
provision
complied
with
by
a
plaintiff
bookseller
who
has
a
policy
of
not
permitting
juveniles
to
examine
and
peruse
materials
covered
by
the
statute
and
who
prohibits
such
conduct
when
observed,
but
otherwise,
takes
no
action
regarding
the
display
of
restricted
materials?
if
not,
would
the
statute
be
complied
with
if
the
store's
policy
were
announced
or
otherwise
manifested
to
the
public?
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
