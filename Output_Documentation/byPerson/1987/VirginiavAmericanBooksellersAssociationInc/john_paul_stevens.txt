justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
go
back
to
justice
white's
question
for
a
minute?
in
footnote
9,
the
court
of
appeals
ends
the
footnote,
saying,
"the
district
court
found
that
a
significant
percentage
of
the
inventory
of
the
average
general
bookstore
varying
between
5
and
25
percent
falls
within
the
amendment's
restrictions.
"
my
question
is,
did
you
ask
that
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
that
finding
as
clearly
erroneous
on
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
you
didn't
should
we
not
accept
that
as
a
factual
determination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
the
end
of
the
footnote.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you
argue
that,
and
then
the
last
sentence
is
the
one
that
the
district
court
found
5
to
25
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
put
it
this
way.
is
it
correct
that
your
position
in
this
court
depends
on
our
disagreeing
with
the
district
court's
finding
of
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
do
that,
may
i
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--even
if
the
witnesses
didn't
understand
what
the
statute
means,
do
you
also
contend
the
district
court
didn't
understand
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
they
done
that
with
respect
to
the
juvenile
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
they
so
ruled
with
respect
to
the
juvenile
statute
as
opposed
to
obscenity
generally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mere
nudity
can
never
be
obscene
for
a
juvenile?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
bator?
does
your
argument
really
focus
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
applies
to
written
material
as
opposed
to
pictorial
material,
you
know,
the
magazines
such
as
hustler
and
so
forth--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand
it
does
apply
to
both.
would
you
have
any
objection,
or
does
your
proof
support
any
objection
to
a
statute
which
just
excluded
the
written
material?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
say
even
if
the
statute
were
limited
to
magazines
such
as
hustler,
assuming
they
are
not
obscene,
and
playboy
and
the
like,
and
those...
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
those
displayed
publicly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
to
display.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--before
the
goalie
retires,
may
i
ask
this
question?
i
have
been
thinking,
as
justice
brennan
apparently
suggested,
about
the
possibility
of
certification.
are
there
three
or
four
works
that
are
identified
in
the
record
with
respect
to
which
the
two
of
you
disagree
as
to
whether
they
are
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
two
or
three
specific
works
of
literature
as
to
which
you
think
the
statute
covers
and
your
opponent
says
it
doesn't
cover
with
respect
to
which
we
could
ask
the
virginia
supreme
court
whether
it
covers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
know
of
any
such
examples
that
come
to
mind
that
sort
of
test
what
the
breadth
of
the
statute
would
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
familiar
with
the
book?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
not
covered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
have
a
square
disagreement
on
that.
let
me
ask
you
another...
may
i
ask
you
another
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
in
the
definition
of
harmful
to
juveniles...
i
had
it
in
front
of
me
a
minute
ago...
the
last
subparagraph
is
on
a42
of
the
jurisdictional
statement...
has
a
subparagraph
c,
"is,
when
taken
as
a
whole,
lacking
in
serious
literary,
artistic,
political.
"
and
so
forth,
"value",
but
the
introduction
of
that
paragraph
says
"quality
of
any
description
or
representation
in
whatever
form.
"
now,
my
question
is,
supposing
you
have
a
ten-chapter
book,
one
chapter
of
which
would
satisfy
the
statute.
does
the
book
satisfy
the
statute
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
paragraph
2
does,
but
the
definition
of
"harmful
to
juveniles"
does
not.
it
is
only
because
of
the
additional
language
in
paragraph
2
that
you
answered
my
ten-chapter
book
the
way
you
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wouldn't
fall
within...
that
wasn't
my
question.
it
wouldn't
fall
within
subparagraph
2
of
391,
but
it
would
fall
within
the
definition
of
subparagraph
6
of
390,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
be
sure.
if
i
merely
had
the
definition
of
harmful
to
juveniles,
the
chapter
we
speak
of
would
be
harmful,
the
book
as
a
whole
would
not,
but
you
are
saying
391
would
not
apply
to
that
because
of
subparagraph
2
to
that
ten-chapter
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
going
to
ask
you
to
debate
it
with
me.
i
am
just
trying
to
ask
your
understanding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
chapter...
subparagraph
2
were
not
in
section
391,
and
we
were
merely
dealing
with
section
390,
which
i
gather
is
the
definition
that
existed
before
the
recent
amendment,
would
my
example
of
a
ten-chapter
book
containing
one
sexually
explicit
chapter
that
would
follow
the
definition,
would
that
book,
work
as
a
whole
in
your
view
be
harmful
to
juveniles
within
that
section?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
mr.
smith,
suppose
a
bookseller
does
not
segregate
books.
would
he
be
able
to
comply
with
the
virginia
statute
by
simply
saying,
whenever
i
see
a
juvenile,
a
person
who
looks
to
me
like
a
juvenile,
browsing
in
a
book
which
is
a
book
that
i
ought
to
know
falls
within
this
statute,
i
stop
that
juvenile
and
ask
him
to
leave
the
store.
that
is
my
store
policy.
would
that
be
enough
to
comply
with
the
statute?
