mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court:
in
this
case
there
was
a
series
of
delays
in
handling
a
person
who
had
initially
escaped
from
custody
and
was
brought
back
into
the
system.
now
that
particular
situation
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
at
the
time
that
the
speedy
trial
act
was
passed.
and
it
was
actually
brought
to
their
attention
that
in
that
situation
the
way
the
congress
had
orchestrated
the
act,
it
was
going
to
require
that
people
in
this
situation,
post-indictment
fugitives
who
are
caught
subsequent
to
their
flight,
were
going
to
have
to
be
given
priority
because
they
were
not
going
to
restart
the
clock.
they
were
going
to
only
give
them,
in
terms
of
the
speedy
trial
act,
as
much
time
as
was
remaining
on
that
speedy
trial
clock
at
the
time
that
they
failed
to
appear.
this
was
something
that
was
considered.
this
was
a
duty,
an
affirmative
duty
that
the
court,
the
trial
court
found
that
the
united
states
attorney
failed.
she
felt
that
with
this
duty
it
was
his
obligation
to
show
prosecutorial
initiative,
make
sure
the
marshals
did
it
correctly,
make
sure
the
marshals
were
aware
that
there
was
a
short
amount
of
time
left.
now
there
is
no
reason
why
the
speedy
trial
act
should
be
violated
because
a
person
does
what
mr.
taylor
did
in
this
case.
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
i
think
it
is
permissible
for
the
trial
court
to
consider
prejudice.
i
don't
think
it's
mandatory.
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
not
when
she
finds
that
the...
i
don't
think
she
would
be
required
to
consider
it,
or
give
it
as
much
weight,
particularly
in
a
situation
whereas
here.
she
found
culpable
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
government.
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
well,
i
would
like
to
think
maybe
i
could
get
him
bail,
but
i
would
agree
that
it
would
substantially
increase,
and
i
think
in
all
probability
he
would
have
stayed
in.
but
there
is
an
additional
prejudice
here
that
i'm
not
sure
anyone
has
recognized
so
far.
and
that
is,
he
was
being
moved
from
one
place
to
another
as
he
made
his
little
route
from
san
francisco
to
seattle.
a
person,
any
person
who
has
been
in
custody
will
tell
you
the
most
dangerous
and
the
most
heart-rending
moments
of
any
custody
are
the
first
periods
of
time
when
you
go
into
a
place.
as
i
calculated
both
his
trips
up
and
down,
he
was
in
12
different
institutions.
he
came
in.
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
well,
i
think
that
may
be
true,
except
that
congress
intended
that
a
person
who
flees
would
not
restart
the
clock,
and
that
that
would
be
taken
care
of
by
excluding
the
time.
his
flight
did
not
contribute
to
the
violation
of
the
act.
it
didn't
force
the
government
in
any
way
to
lose
track
of
what
was
going
on,
when
he
was
going
to
go
in
front
of
a
magistrate.
i
mean
there
was
no
causation
there.
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
well,
i
mean
i
will
just
say
this.
he
was
caught
in
his
home.
this
case
emanated
out
of
san
francisco.
they
were
caught
on
an
airplane.
he
went
back
home.
i
mean--
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
--no,
not
at
all.
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
i
don't
think
it's...
it
didn't
lead
to
the
dismissal.
so
i
don't
think
it's
considerable
under
the
second
required
statutory
fact,
or
the
facts
and
circumstances
that
led
to
the
dismissal.
it
is
clearly
something
that
the
court
can
take
into
account.
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
it
would
be
a
proper
factor
in
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
it
would
be
dismissed
with
prejudice.
but
she
chose
to
focus
on
the
conduct
of
the
government.
they
had
an
affirmative
duty.
she
also
knew
that
the
co-defendant
in
this
case,
the
one
that
was
argued
was
co-equally
culpable
and
with
a
similar
record
and
a
similar
background,
had
gotten
three
years
already.
that
was
his
sentence.
and
i
think
when
the
court
took
into
account
all
of
the
factors
in
this
case,
she
felt,
look,
the
co-defendant
gets
three
years.
this
guy
ran
away.
i've
got
to
make
sure
the
marshals,
i've
got
to
make
sure
the
united
states
attorneys
understand
their
obligations
under
the
act,
so
i
am
going
to
dismiss
it
with
prejudice.
but
i
am
going
to
give
him
five
on
the
bail
jump.
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
well,
i
think
that
one
of
the
aims
of
this
speedy
trial
act
was
to
give
the
court
a
lot
of
discretion
to
deal
with
the
act
and
its
application
in
their
district.
and
there
as
a
systemic
problem
that
was
recognized
back
in...
i
mean
it's
in
the
legislative
history
about
marshals
trying
to
assemble
prisoners
and
move
them
in
an
economical
fashion.
and
i'll
point
out
that
when
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
that
was
served
on
him
after
he
had
begun
his
journey
back
to
seattle
was
served
on
him,
they
had
him
down
here
in
a
couple
of
days,
three,
four
days.
i
mean
when
they
want
to
move
fast,
they
can
move
fast.
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
well,
she
felt
that...
she
felt
that
the
marshall
was
going
to
do
what
it
normally
did,
and
that
is
wait
until
prisoners
get...
wait
until
they
get
a
substantial
number
of
prisons
and
then
move
them
along.
she
felt
that
the
prosecutor,
the
united
state
attorney's
office
was
lackadaisical
in
not
making
sure
that
they
understood
that
if
they
took
longer
than
10
days,
i
mean
the
act
gives
them
10
days
to
make
the
move.
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
i
understand
that,
but
the
government
had
an
opportunity
to
rebut
that
presumption,
had
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
talk
about
the
marshall's
problems,
and
they
didn't
do
it.
there
was
no
particular
problem
here.
and
i
think
it's
shown
by
the
fact
that
they
moved
them
down
in
four
days
when
they
wanted
him
back
down
here
for
a
trial.
the
marshall
moves
at
the
request
of
other
agencies.
you
know,
if
left
to
their
own
devices,
they'll
take
their
own
time.
but
i've
had
cases
involved
where
the
united
states
attorney
wanted
someone
transported,
and
they
chartered
a
plane
and
moved
him
in
two
hours.
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
i
would
agree
that
it
is
a
burden
on
the
state
to
proceed
again.
i
think
that
what
this
court
did
was
remove
that
burden
by
taking
the
total
conduct
of
the
defendant,
both
his
flight
and
what
could
be
attributed
to
the
drug
case,
assuming
he
was
guilty;
figured
that
she
could
cover
all
of
that
conduct
with
a
five-year
sentence,
based
on
the
fact
that
the
co-defendant
got
three.
but
she
felt
it
was
important
to
send
a
message
to
the
marshall,
send
a
message
to
the
united
states
attorney
that
just
because
a
guy
runs
away
does
not
mean
that
he
loses
all
of
his
speedy
trial
rights,
and
that
the
system
itself
needed
to
be
shaken
a
little
bit
to
make
sure
that
they
were
going
to
fulfill
their
responsibilities.
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
i
argued
that
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
for
mr.
taylor.
i
told
the
judge
at
that
time
that
for
him
to
live
in
custody,
and
he
was
going
to
do
time
on
the
bail
jump,
with
the
knowledge
that
this
case
might
result
in
a
reversal
and
he
might
face
additional
time,
or
not
know
whether
he
was
going
to
face
additional
time,
and
i
argued
to
the
court
that
she
should
sentence
him
for
the
total
conduct
so
that
he
would
know,
even
if
it
got
reversed,
that
he
was
not
going
to
have
to
spend
a
bunch
of
time.
i
mean
he
got
out
about
two
weeks
ago.
i
mean
he
served
a
substantial
amount
of
time,
because
they
took
into
account
in
terms
of
the
parole
the
fact...
they
assumed
the
underlying
offense
was
there,
and
that
he
was
guilty
of
it,
and
so
his
guidelines
were
adjusted
upward,
and
he
served
a
substantial
amount
of
the
time
that
he
was
sentenced
to.
i
think
he
served
three
and
a
half
to
four
years,
which
would
be
much
more
than
a
normal
person
would
on
a
five-year
sentence,
with
no
essential
criminal
history.
now
i
think
this
court
was
focusing
a
lot
on
the
number
of
delays.
they
talked
about
the
state
court
proceedings.
well,
i
mean
they
didn't
even
honor
the
state
court's
order
that
he
be
returned
to
the
state...
to
the
court
where
that
state
proceeding
was
occurring.
that
judge
on
the
20th
of
february
said,
and
sent
them
an
order,
i
demand
the
presence
of
this
man
in
my
court.
we
have
a
pending
cases
against
it.
it
was
a
petty
theft
case.
the
marshals
ignored
it.
they
never
produced
him.
yet,
later
on
they
argued
that
he
was
in
state
custody
for
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
it
shouldn't
be
excludable.
i
mean
they
can't
really
have
it
both
ways.
he
was...
i
mean
he
spent
maybe
a
month
in
custody
before
they
got
him
in
front
of
the
magistrate.
i
would
say
five
or
six
of
those
days
he
was
about
300
feet
from
the
magistrate's
office
in
the
holding
cell
upstairs
in
the
federal
building
in
san
francisco.
yet,
he
never
made
it
over
to
be
arraigned.
he
never
made
it
over
to
get
the
process
started.
and,
you
know,
that
was
the
kind
of
conduct
that
the
court
felt
she
couldn't
countenance,
and
it
was
not...
it
was
a
hollow
remedy
or
a
hollow
sanction
to
say
that
you
took
too
long,
you
didn't
fulfill
your
responsibilities
under
the
act.
so
what
are
we
going
to
do
to
you?
we're
going
to
give
you
another
70
days
in
order
to
do
all
of
this
again.
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
the
client
is
in
a
halfway
house
in
san
francisco,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
g.
loveseth
sure,
sure.
and
i
think
the
trial
court
is
the
one
who
is
in
a
position
to
make
these
kinds
of
evaluations.
she
is
the
one
who
has
to
live
with
the
way
the
speedy
trial
act
is
going
to
be
administered
in
her
district,
what
the
attitude
of
the
prosecutors
are
in
these
various
kinds
of
situations.
she
can
evaluate
all
the
competing
interests.
she
has
all
of
the
kinds
of
nuances
in
a
case
that
a
trial
court
knows
about
that
don't
really
filter
up:
what
she
is
going
to
give
the
guy
later
on,
what
the
co-defendant
got,
what
was
the
attitude
as
expressed
by
the
united
states
attorney.
i
mean
this
united
states
attorney
was
recalcitrant,
just
absolutely
was
not
willing
to
accept
any
responsibility
to
actively
assure
that
this
man
was
brought
back.
he
knew
there
was
only
one
day
left
of
the
speedy
trial
time,
and
yet
he
did
nothing
to
make
the
system
work
a
little
faster,
and
that
was
a
concept
that
was
discussed
in
the
legislative
history.
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
by
mr.
snead
from
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
and
he
says,
we're
going
to
have
to
give
these
guys
priority
if
you
don't
restart
the
clock.
now,
i
will
agree
that
maybe
congress
ought
to
change
that,
and
restart
the
clock
and
give
it
a
little
extra
time,
but
they
didn't.
the
statutory
scheme
is
as
it
is,
and
the
duty
was...
the
duty
was
on
the
prosecutor
to
make
sure
that
the
system
responded
quickly
and
gave
this
guy
a
chance
to
get
back
up
before
the
speedy
trial
act
was
violated.
and
then
in
terms
of
the
remedy,
she
did
exactly
what
the
statute
told
her
to
do.
she
said,
look,
it's
a
serious
offense,
but,
too,
i
believe
it
was
the
government's
conduct
that
led
to
the
dismissal
and
that
requires
a
stern
response.
and
that
if
i'm
going
to
administer
the
act
and
justice
in
this
court
and
in
this
district,
i
have
to
respond
sternly;
otherwise
the
speedy
trial
act
is
just
a
hollow
guarantee
and
it
doesn't
really
mean
anything.
she
had
enough
time
to
make
it...
i
mean
this
is
not
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
this
man
got
five
years
in
a
situation
where
had
it
just
been
the
bail
jump,
i
don't
think
she
would
have
even
considered
giving
him
that
much.
it
was
the
co-defendant,
who
they
argued
was
of
equal
culpability,
the
same
record,
got
three.
she
had
enough
time
to
work
with.
she
balanced
all
of
the
factors.
she
was
the
one
charged
with
the
responsibility
to
evaluate
all
of
these
considerations.
and
i
thought
she
came
up
with
the
perfect
result.
it
saved
the
government
the
expense
of
retrying
him.
it
saved
the
government
the
expense
of
going
back
before
the
grand
jury.
it
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
get
out
of
his
pre-trial
situation
and
start
serving
his
time.
and
yet
it
took
into
account
and
was
responsive
to
what
justice
demanded
in
that
situation.
he
shouldn't
be
rewarded
for
running
away,
and
he
wasn't.
he
didn't
get
one
extra
day
that
counted
towards
the
speedy
trial
time.
and
he
was
punished
severely
for
what
he
did,
and
that
was
the
scheme
that
congress
intended
when
they
passed
the
speedy
trial
act
and
noted
that
when
a
person
runs
away
it
doesn't
restart
the
clock.
his
flight
didn't
lead
to
the
dismissal.
the
culpable
conduct
of
the
government,
the
lackadaisical
attitude,
the
recalcitrant
attitude,
that's
what
led
to
the
dismissal.
and
i
think
to
put
into
the
hands
of
the
trial
courts
the
discretion
to
deal
with
these
complicated
situations
and
competing
interests
is
the
best
thing
that
this
court
could
do.
thank
you.
