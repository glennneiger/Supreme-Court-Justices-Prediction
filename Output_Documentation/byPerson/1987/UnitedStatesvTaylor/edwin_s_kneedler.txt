mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
district
court
may
properly
dismiss
an
indictment
with
prejudice
when
it
finds
a
minor
violation
of
the
time
limits
contained
in
the
speedy
trial
act
of
1974.
the
speedy
trial
act
provides,
in
general,
that
a
federal
criminal
prosecution,
the
trial
in
such
a
prosecution
must
commence
within
70
days
of
the
returning
and
making
public
of
the
indictment
or
information,
or
within
70
days
of
the
defendant's
first
appearance
of
a
judicial
officer
of
the
district,
whichever
occurs
later.
the
act,
of
course,
contains
certain
exclusions
from
the
running
of
the
70-day
time
period,
some
of
which
were
applied
in
this
case
for
such
things
as
other
proceedings
relating
to
the
defendant,
delay
attributable
to
the
removal
or
transportation
of
a
defendant
from
another
district,
and
continuances
of
the
trial
for
situations
in
which
the
court
finds
that
the
ends
of
justice
would
warrant
such
a
continuance.
now,
if
the
defendant
is
not
brought
to
trial
within
70
days,
taking
account
of
any
exclusions,
the
statute
provides
that
the
indictment
or
information
shall
be
dismissed,
but
the
act
does
not
provide
that
such
an
indictment
must
be
with
prejudice,
thereby
forever
closing
the
government
from
prosecuting
the
defendant
for
the
conduct
underlying
the
indictment
or
information.
congress
considered
such
a
proposal
and
also
a
proposal
that
would
have
created
at
least
a
presumption
in
favor
of
a
prohibition
against
reprosecution,
but
congress
rejected
that
and
instead
adopted
what
is
now
in
section
3162(a)(2)
of
title
18
dealing
with
the
dismissal
sanction.
there
congress
provides
that
a
balancing
test
must
be
applied
in
determining
whether
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed
with
our
without
prejudice.
and
congress
specifically
provided
that
the
district
court,
in
making
that
determination,
shall
consider,
among
other
things,
each
of
three
separate
factors.
the
first
is
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
the
second
is
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
that
led
to
the
dismissal.
and
the
third
is
the
impact
of
a
reprosecution
on
the
administration
of
the
speedy
trial
act
and
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
affirming
the
district
court
found
a
violation
of
the
speedy
trial
act,
a
total
of
14
days
by
which
the
70-day
time
limit
was
exceeded.
the
court
of
appeals
then
affirmed
the
district
court's
decision
dismissing
that
indictment
with
prejudice
despite
the
existence
of
what,
in
our
view,
are
a
host
of
factors,
all
of
which
weigh
decidedly
against
that
severe
sanction.
for
example--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
the
standard
the
courts
have
applied,
and
we
don't
dispute
that
as
the
legal
test.
but
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
several
things
along
those
lines.
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
district
court's
discretion
is
entirely
unfettered.
congress
prescribed
the
statutory
standards
that
are
to
be
applied,
the
ones
that
i
just
recited.
so
it
is
essential
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
evaluate
the
district
court's
decision
to
see
whether
those
factors
were
in
fact
taken
into
account;
whether
all
the
subsidiary
considerations,
for
example,
bearing
on
the
administration
of
justice
were
considered.
and
then
in
addition,
whether
the
district
court
made
a
clear
error
in
weighing
the
various
considerations.
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
in
fact
the
district
court
erred
in
both
respects
by
not
giving
full
consideration
to
the
relevant
factors
and
by
committing
a
clear
error
in
the
balancing
to
the
extent
it
did
consider
them.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
do
not.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
argument.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
did
argue
that
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
fact,
we
do
not
dispute
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
speedy
trial
act
here.
that
conclusion
is
not
free
from
doubt.
for
example,
the
way
in
which
the
continuance,
the
end
of
justice
continuances
were
calculated
in
this
case
led
to
the
scheduling
of
the
trial
on
what
the
district
court
found
to
be
the
69th
day
of
the
70-day
period.
as
we
point
out
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
however,
the
premise
of
that
was
erroneous,
and
we
disagree
with
the
court's
failure
to
exclude
six
days
of
the
time
limit
that
we
explained
at
pages
23
to
25
in
our
brief.
but
as
we
present
the
case
here,
we
assume
that
there
was
a
violation,
as
we
counted
it,
of
eight
days.
and
so
we
are
presenting
the
case
on
the
question
of
remedy,
not
on
whether
there
was
a
violation,
although
i
do
think
that
certainly
the
length
of
the
delay
and
the
question
of
whether
it
was
a
close
question
as
to
whether
the
act
was
even
violated
would
properly
bear
on
the
question
of
whether
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed
with
or
without
prejudice.
so
to
that
extent,
the
various
arguments
in
which
the...
whether
the
clock
should
be
restarted
would
be
relevant
on
the
question
of
remedy.
the
various
factors
that
we
believe
in
this
case
weight
heaving
against
dismissing
the
indictment
with
prejudice
were,
first,
that
the...
as
both
courts
below
conceded,
and
as
respondent
does
not
contest,
the
offenses
in
this
case,
narcotic
offenses,
both
conspiracy
and
a
possession
count
were
serious,
carrying
potential
for
imprisonment
up
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
rule
48
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
speedy
trial
act,
rule
48
of
the
criminal
rules
provided
for
dismissal
of
cases
basically
for
want
of
prosecution,
and
then
that
was...
then
when
the
speedy
trial
clause
of
the
constitution
was
given
particular
force
in
barker
v.
wingo,
that
and
the
speedy
trial
act
have
to
some
extend
rule
48
and
importance,
but
it
would
be
rule
48.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
ordinarily
not.
a
dismissal
for
want
of
prosecution
under
rule
48
i
think
would
ordinarily
be
without
prejudice.
now
the
statute
of
limitations
might
kick
in
at
some
point
and
bar
reprosecution
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
it's
only
because
of
the...
under
the
speedy
trial
act,
it's
because
the
speedy
trial
act
authorizes
the
dismissal
in
that
form.
but
it
gives
to
the
district
court
a
weighty
responsibility
to
decide
whether
the
dismissal
should
be
with
or
without
prejudice,
because
after
all,
a
dismissal
with
prejudice
results
in
the
freeing
of
a
defendant
without
an
adjudication
of
his
guilt
or
innocence,
and
it's
generally
regarded
to
be
in
the
public
interest
for
criminal
charges
to
be
adjudicated
on
the
merits,
and
not
dismissed
for
no
reason...
not
no
reason
at
all,
but
unless
there
are
substantial
reasons
for
doing
so.
and
also,
congress
specifically
charged
the
courts
under
the
speedy
trial
act
with
trying
to
draw
the
line
between
the
serious
and
less
serious
violations
of
the
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
don't
think
it's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--for
the
failure
to
appear.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
don't
think
that
should
play
a
substantial
role
here.
congress
prescribed
separate
criminal
sanctions
for
these
offenses,
and
the
narcotic
offenses
here
are
serious,
and
carry
more
serious
consequences.
and
at
the
time
the
indictment
was
dismissed
here,
the
district
court
had
not
yet
imposed
that
sanction.
the
defendant
had
not
yet
pleaded
guilty.
so
in
terms
of...
congress,
in
the
speedy
trial
act,
requires
the
court
to
focus
on
the
particular
charges
in
the
indictment.
and
i
am
reluctant
to
say
that's
altogether
irrelevant,
but
we
don't
think
that
given
what
congress
was
focusing
on,
the
charges
in
the
indictment
and
factors
bearing
on
those
charges
in
the
weighing
process,
that
that
factor
should
play
a
substantial
role.
it's
quite
possible
that
if
the
defendant
was
convicted,
that
he
could
get
a
sentence
considerably
more
than
the
five
years
that
he
got
on
the
failure
to
appear
charge.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
first
of
all,
we're
not
saying--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
first
of
all,
we
are
not
saying
that
this
court
should
say
that
a
court
can
never...
the
district
court
can
never
dismiss
with
prejudice.
our
position
is
that
what
the
district
courts
are
obligated
to
do
is
to
try
to
locate
the
case
on
a
spectrum
between
the
least
serious
technical
violations
and
the
most
serious.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
and
the
court
should
at
least
focus
on
that
question
and
dismiss
only
when
there
has
been
a
serious
violation
of
the
statutory
standards.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
from
this
court?
well,
it
seems--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
i
think
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
court...
it's
not
possible,
and
i
think
this
case
is
a
good
example
of
that.
a
court
of
appeals
is
somewhat
at
a
loss
if
the
district
court
declines
to
address
all
of
the
relevant
factors
that
congress
has
made
relevant
in
the
statute
that
must
be
weighed
by
the
district
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
know
that
the
government
went
back
and
asked
for
more.
but
in
this
case
all
that
the
district
court
considered,
for
example,
with
respect
to
the
second
and
third
factors
under
the
statutory
test,
the
second
being
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
leading
to
dismissal,
and
the
other
being
on
the
administration
of
the
act;
all
the
court
focused
on
was
what
it
termed
a
lackadaisical
attitude
of
the
marshall
service
in
returning
the
defendant
form
california
to
washington.
after
all,
he
had
fled
to
california,
and
the
marshall
service
was
taking
him
back.
but
there
are
other
consideration
that
are
relevant
both
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
and
to
the
administration
of
justice.
and
the
district
court
did
not
address
those
other
considerations.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
what
we
would
hope
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
we
would
hope
not
to
have
to
present
the
court
with
an
occasion
in
the
future.
what
we
would
help
is
that
the
court
would
make
clear
that
the
district
courts
in
this
case
really
should
apply
two
principles
that
we
think
would
give
a
lot
of
guidance
to
the
lower
courts.
the
first
one
is
the
one
that
i
just
mentioned,
and
that
is
that
the
court
must
consider
all
of
the
factors
that
congress
made
relevant
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
ultimate
determination.
and
that
is
whether
offsetting
those
that
weigh
in
favor
of
dismissal
with
prejudice
against
those
that
weigh
against,
the
net
circumstances
of
the
case
are
sufficiently
aggravated
that
dismissal
with
prejudice
is
an
appropriate
remedy
after
offsetting
one
against
the
other.
and
the
other
principle
that
we
think
would
provide
useful
guidance
to
the
lower
courts,
in
fact,
it's
generally
applied
by
the
courts
of
appeals
now,
is
that
where
you
have
a
serious
offense
as
it's
conceded
here,
an
indictment
should
not
be
dismissed
with
prejudice
absent
a
correspondingly
serious
violation
or
delay
past
the
70-day
period,
especially
where,
again
as
here,
there
is
no
prejudice
to
the
defendant
resulting
from
that
delay.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
we
do,
because
in
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
district
court
conceded
that
this
was
a
serious
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
think
the
district
court
violated
that
too,
because
under
the
second
and
third
factors
in
this
case,
the
district
court,
as
i
said,
only
focused
on
what
it
termed
the
lackadaisical
attitude
of
the
marshall
service
which
we
think
is
in
fact
a
considerably
overdrawn
view,
but
it
did
not
consider
the
other
circumstances
under
the
second
and
third
factor.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
think
this
court
can
properly
reverse
outright,
and
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--on
your
first
point,
the
district
court
did
not
rely
on
the
five-year
sentence.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
i
don't
know,
justice
stevens.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
didn't
say
it
was
impermissible.
i
just
don't
think
it
was
a
substantial--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
i
think
that
would
be,
because
again
the
escape
was
a
separate
offense,
separately
provided
for
by
congress,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but
it
does
factor
in
directly
to
the
second
and
third
parts
of
the
balance
of
test.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
it
also
goes
directly...
yes,
yes,
definitely,
because
it
goes
directly
to,
for
example,
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case.
the
trial
here
was
scheduled
on
the
69th
day.
in
fact,
probably
even
the
69th,
but
within
the
70-day
period,
and
it
was
respondent
who
didn't
show
up,
and
thereby
undermined,
seriously
undermined
the
purposes
of
the
speedy
trial
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
they
also
go,
in
our
view,
to
the
question
of
whether
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed
with
prejudice,
because
one
of
the
factors
is
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
leading
to
dismissal.
the
triggering
event
here
was
the
respondent
not
showing
up
for
his
trial.
it
was
a
"but
for"
cause
and
he
precipitated
the
occasion
for
the
subsequent
violation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
and
there
are
two
reasons
why
i
think
that
would
be
proper.
first,
the
question
of
whether
the
district
court's
discretion
was
abused
under
the
standard
of
review
that
i
was
describing
as
a
question
of
law.
and,
second,
we
think,
in
partial
response
to
justice
marshall's
question,
that
it
would
provide
useful
guidance
for
this
court,
to
the
lower
courts
to
describe
this
case
as
one
that
was
outside
of,
in
our
view,
any
reasonable
ambit
of
discretion
the
district
court
would
have
in
a
situation
like
this.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
are
two
responses
to
that,
at
least.
the
first
is
we
don't
know
that
it
was
a
mistake,
or
that
the
judge
would
have
responded
differently.
but
the
second--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
that's
true.
but
the
second
point
is
that
if
the
judge
feels
that's
true,
the
judge...
all
we're
talking
about
is
reinstating
the...
or
allowing
the
reindictment.
if
the
respondent
is
convicted,
the
district
judge
could
make
the
sort
of
adjustment
you
are
talking
about
in
imposing
a
sentence
on
the
narcotics
offenses.
so
it's
not
now
or
never
in
terms
of
taking
into
account
any
possible
interplay
between
the
two
offenses.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
the
escape
and
substantive
offenses
were
both...
were
both
in
the
western
district
of
washington.
ordinarily
it
would
go
back
to
the
same
judge.
but
anyway
there
would
be
that
occasion
for
making
an
adjustment
if
the
district
court
imposed
a
sentence
on
an
erroneous
premise.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
the
finding
was
based
on
affidavits.
there
was
an
affidavit
submitted
by
a
dea
agent
explaining
the
basis
for
the
transportation
delay.
there
were
actually
three
periods
of
delay
that
the
court
found
in
terms
of
finding
of
violation.
in
terms
of
the
remedy,
the
district
court...
the
record
doesn't
indicate
the
district
court
considered
anything
beyond
that.
and
i
think
what
you
bring
up
i
think
raises
another
important
point.
and
that
is
that
the
statute
3162(a)(2)
specifically
provides
that
the
defendant
bears
the
burden
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
and
in
the
melguizo
case,
which
is
pending
on
certiorari
here,
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
said
that
that
includes
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
is
a
systemic
problem
in
the
government's
handling
of
prisoners
or
bringing
cases
to
trial
that
warrants
some
sort
of
didactic
sanction.
and
the
defendant
in
that
case
came
forward
with
no
evidence
showing
that
there
was
some
general
problem
in
the
administration
of
the
speedy
trial
act.
similarly
here,
the
respondent
didn't
come
forward
with
any
general
evidence,
or
at
least
the
record
doesn't
indicate
that
there
was
a
problem
with
the
marshall
service
transporting
prisoners.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
all
the
district
court
said
was
that,
and
in
fact
that
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
all
the...
no,
all
the
district
court
relied
on
was
the
sequence
of
events
in
california
before
respondent
was
returned
to
washington
state.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
on
this
point,
no.
and
there
was
a
declaration
by
respondent's
counsel.
but
on
this
question
i
think
it
was
just
the
two
affidavits
from
the
dea
agent
and
i
guess
two
declarations
from
respondent's
counsel.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
that
appears--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
appears
in
the
affidavit.
that
goes
to
one
of
the
three
periods.
it
took
14
days.
the
statute
provides
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
anything
in
excess
of
10
days
is
unreasonable.
here
the
affidavit
stated
that
the...
that
four
of
the
days
were
while
the
marshall
was
waiting
to
assembly
a
group
of
prisoners
to
take
up
to
washington
and
oregon
in
order
to
save
money.
another
period
of
the
delay
in
this
case
are
the
six
days
that
we
say
shouldn't
have
been
included
at
all
was
the
six
days
between
february
22nd,
when
the
federal
case
in
which
respondent
was
to
testify
was
over,
and
february
28th,
when
the
state
charges
in
california
in
which
respondent
was
being
held
was
dismissed.
well,
during
that
period
the
marshall
service
was
under
no
responsibility
to
take
respondent
back
to
washington
because
the
state
charges
were
still
pending,
and
in
fact
he
was
being
held
in
a
state
jail
in
san
francisco.
so
during
that
six-day
period
there
wasn't
even
a
violation
at
all,
in
our
view.
the
remaining
time
is
the
period
from
march
1
of
'85
to
march
6th
of
'85,
the
time
between
when
the
marshall
service
was
told
that
the
state
charges
against
respondent
were
dismissed
and
respondent's
first
appearance
before
a
magistrate
for
a
removal
hearing
under
rule
40(e).
and
we
think
that
that
period
certainly
doesn't
warrant
dismissal
on
an
indictment
with
prejudice.
for
one
thing,
as
soon
as
respondent
had
his
initial
appearance,
there
were
then
three
continuances,
all
either
agreed
to
or
asked
for
by
his
counsel
to
keep
him
in
california
for
another
month.
respondent
was
not
interested
in
going
back,
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
and
these
transcripts...
let
me
add
that,
justice
kennedy.
the
transcripts
of
the
removal
proceedings
in
california
are
also
in
the
record.
and
they
do
show
one
additional
important
thing
in
the
excerpts
of
record,
and
that
is
that
at
the
removal--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--for
purposes
of
this
case
here,
we
are
not
challenging
that,
yes;
there
were
eight
days
beyond
the
70
days.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
were
only
eight
days
past
the
70-day
period,
and
in
our
view
that
is
so
minimal
that
it
cannot--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
respondent
was
held
during
the
relevant
period
in
custody
on
the
bench
warrant
for
his
failure
to
appear
at
trial
in
washington
when
it
was
scheduled,
and
there
was
not
speedy
trial
act
problem
with
that,
and
he
was
held
in
custody
because
he
had
escaped,
or
had
fled
to
california.
so
there
was
no
prejudice
relevant
for
purposes
of
this
case
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
was
held
in
custody
during
that
period.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
magical
point,
but
the
courts
have
generally,
and
we
state
some
of
these
cases
in
our
brief.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
not
an
absolute
deadline
because,
again,
it
might
well
depend
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
but
where
in
the
context...
in
the
overall
of
the
case
the
excess
period
is
minimal--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
would
be
reluctant
to
say
on
a
72-day
one,
but
some
period--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--at
some
point,
yes,
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--at
some
point,
i
think
the
court
probably
could.
but
again,
i
think
the
court
would
want
to
look
to
see
what
the
nature
of
the
failing
in
the
individual
cases
was.
it
may
be
that
they
all
had
individual
explanations
that
wouldn't
lend
themselves
to
a
systemic
solution.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
know
the
current
status.
there
was
some
discussion
of
the
comparable
state
laws
at
the
time
the
'74
act
was
passed.
and
my
recollection
is
that
california
was
cited
as
the
leading
example,
and
california
had
dismissal
without
prejudice.
now
i
don't
know
what
the
general
state
of
the
law...
but,
of
course,
here
congress
prescribed
the
bottom
line.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
there
might
have
been
variation.
in
fact,
the
aba
had
recommended
that
in
1974,
but
congress
declined
to
adopt
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
not
if
the
case
is
decided
this
term.
i
believe
the
statute
of
limitations
would
be...
the
offenses
were
charged
in
december
of
1983.
so
if
the
case
is
disposed
of
this
term,
there
would
be
time
for
a
reindictment
prior
to
december
of
1988.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
we
don't
believe
that
they
have
a
duty
to
do
it
immediately.
the
statute
in
fact
sets
up
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
any
time
in
excess
of
10
days
is
unreasonable.
we
don't
say
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
there
is
an
exclusion
under
the
speedy
trial
act,
paragraph
h,
which
excludes
time
involved
in
the
transportation
of
the
defendant
from
one
district
to
another,
and
that
exclusion
establishes
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
any
time
in
excess
of
10
days
is
unreasonable.
i
think
the
import
of
that
is
that
just
because
it's
over
10
days
doesn't
mean
that
it's
automatically
unreasonable,
and
the
assembling
of
prisoners
to
transport
prisoners
in
an
economical
fashion
is
certainly
a
permissible
goal.
we
just
aren't
raising
here...
we
aren't
challenging
the
finding
below
that
that
was
a
violation
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
because
we
think
the
remedy
question
is
of
broader
importance.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
several
points
i
would
like
to
make.
first,
respondent
is
wrong
that
his
flight
did
not
contribute,
or
was
not
one
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
leading
to
the
dismissal
in
this
case.
as
the
record
makes
completely
clear,
trial
was
scheduled
on
november
19,
1984,
and
if
respondent
had
shown
up
like
he
was
supposed
to,
the
trial
would
have
been
held
within
the
speedy
trial
act
70-day
period
and
there
would
have
been
no
occasion
for
a
violation
at
all.
and
secondly,
respondent
contributed
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
delays
found
by
the
district
court
here
were
all
involved
in
returning
respondent
from
the
place
to
which
he
had
fled
back
to
the
place
in
which
he
was
supposed
to
be
tried.
so
respondent
cannot
avoid
all
culpability
for
the
speedy
trial
act
violation
simply
by
saying
he
was
separately
prosecuted
for
the
failure
to
show
up.
his
flight
directly
ties
in
to
one
of
the
statutory
purposes
on
the
remedy,
and
that
is
the
effect
of
a
reprosecution
on
the
administration
of
the
speedy
trial
act.
respondent
undermined
the
purposes
of
the
speedy
trial
act
and
a
reprosecution
of
respondent
would
demonstrate
that
a
defendant
who
deliberately
flouts
that
act
will
not
get
away
with
it,
and
will
be...
and
the
charges
that
he
sought
to
to
avoid
will
in
fact
be
prosecuted.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
say
is
that
counsel
says
that
the
marshall
service
ignored
an
order
of
february
20th
requiring
the
marshall
to
return
respondent
to
state
custody.
in
fact,
that
order,
which
appears
at
the
excerpt
of
record
on
page
20,
is
directed
to
the
sheriff
of
san
francisco
county,
not
to
the
marshall
service.
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
if
the
san
mateo
court
had
wanted
respondent
for
an
appearance,
it
could
have
gotten
him
from
the
sheriff.
there
is
no
indication
in
fact
that
the
marshall
service
was
aware
of
that
order.
the
third
point
is
that
as
the
record
shows
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
in
fact
believed
the
clock
restarted
when
respondent
was
brought
back
to
washington.
and
far
from
being
recalcitrant,
he
was
operating
on
a
misunderstanding
of
what
the
act
requires.
and
the
fourth
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
although
the
district
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
is
a
district
court
brief
filed
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
the
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
he
argued
that
the
entire
period
was...
or
the
clock
restarted.
the
last
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
although
the
district
court
recited
the
second
and
third
facts,
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
the
act
and
justice,
she
only
focused
on
the
marshall
service
conduct.
she
didn't
focus
on
the
other
facts
and
circumstances
and
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice
that
weigh
strongly
against
dismissal
of
the
indictment
with
prejudice.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
know
that
it's
prohibitive,
but
that
should
not...
i
mean
if
it
was
a
totally
unrelated
charge,
should
that
entitle
a
district
court
to
dismiss
an
indictment
with
prejudice?
we
think
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
think
not.
the
court,
in
deciding
whether
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
should
focus
on
the
charges
in
that
indictment
and
the
government's
conduct
with
respect
to
those
charges,
not
on
some
unrelated
offence,
a
state
offense
or
some
unrelated
federal
offense.
here
it
happened
to
be
related,
but
we
don't
think
that
that
has
any
bearing
on
the
court's
requirement
to
focus
on
the
seriousness
of
the
charges
carrying
15
years
offenses,
narcotics
offenses,
and
the
fact
that
the
defendant's
flight
undermined
the
purposes
of
the
act.
