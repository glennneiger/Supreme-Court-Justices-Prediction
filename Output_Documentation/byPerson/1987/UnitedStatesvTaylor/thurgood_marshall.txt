mr.
kneedler,
the
statute
was
passed
in
order
to
get
prompt
prosecutions,
right?
justice
marshall
and
one
way
to
do
that
is
to
prod
the
prosecutor.
if
we
say
that
all
you
can
do
is
to
dismiss
without
prejudice,
how
would
that
prod
the
prosecutor?
justice
marshall
if
the
only
thing
that
will
be
done
is
to
say,
oops,
you
shouldn't
have
done
that.
justice
marshall
and
write
that
out.
justice
marshall
do
you
want
that
in
writing?
justice
marshall
do
you
want
that
in
writing?
justice
marshall
no,
from
the
trial
court.
justice
marshall
is
that
what
you
are
insisting
on?
justice
marshall
did
the
government
ask
him
for
that?
justice
marshall
frankly,
what
worries
me
is
if
we
are
going
to
have
to
take
every
one
of
these
cases.
justice
marshall
i
would
hope
not.
justice
marshall
well,
don't
you
agree
that
there
was
eight
days
over?
justice
marshall
i
don't
understand
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
marshall
eight
days
is
minimal?
have
you
ever
tried
in
jail
for
eight
days?
