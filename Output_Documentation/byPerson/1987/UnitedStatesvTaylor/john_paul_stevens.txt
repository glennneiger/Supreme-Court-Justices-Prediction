justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
are
you
saying
that
we
should
send
the
case
back
and
ask
him
to
reconsider
all
the
facts
and
write
a
more
elaborate
opinion
before
he
comes
to
the
conclusion,
or
are
we
to
decide
that
the--
justice
stevens
--we
can
weigh
those
facts
and
say
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
five-year
sentence
shouldn't
have
been
taken
into
consideration
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
and
evaluate
this
history
of
events
and
say--
justice
stevens
--well,
maybe
he
did
and
maybe
he
didn't.
he
didn't
put
it
in
the
opinion,
but
i
wonder
if
in
the
back
of
the
district
judge's
mind
wasn't
the
fact
that
i
know
this
man
is
guilty
of
what
happened
in
this
courtroom
and
i'll
slug
it
to
him
on
that,
because
five
years
is
a
pretty
severe
sentence
for
that.
i
take
it
that's
not
the
guideline
sentence,
is
it?
justice
stevens
but
say
he
did
in
fact
take
that
in,
you
say
that
would
be
impermissible
for
him
to
take--
justice
stevens
--well,
if
he
writes
an
opinion
and
he
says,
if
he
had
pleaded
guilty
to
the
narcotics
offense,
i
think
i
would
have
given
him
five
years
based
on
guidelines
or
other
considerations,
and
i
think
i
can
give
this
man
adequate
punishment
by
giving
him
five
years
for
the
flight,
and
i
also
can
clean
up
a
problem
in
the
marshall's
office
if
i
enter
this
remedy.
would
that
be
an
impermissible
exercise
of
his
discretion?
justice
stevens
but
in
some
of
your
filings
i
think
you
rely
on
the
escape
as
something
that
justifies
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
don't
you?
justice
stevens
even
though
he
got
adequately
punished
for
it.
justice
stevens
but
does
that
go
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
the
clock?
justice
stevens
in
any
event,
the
real
thrust
of
your
argument
is
not
that
he
should
take
another
look
at
all
the
facts
that
you
describe.
but
rather,
that
the
facts
are
so
clear
that
we
can
examine
the
record
and
decide--
justice
stevens
--as
a
matter
of
law
in
this
case
it
had
to
be
without
prejudice.
justice
stevens
well,
are
you
asking
us
to
announce
the
general
rule
that
any
delay
of
less
than
two
days,
five
days,
10
days
shall
not
give
rise
to
a
dismissal
with
prejudice?
justice
stevens
we
should
superimpose
a
secondary
line
in
addition
to
the
70-day
deadline,
we
have
sort
of
a
second
deadline
where
you
are
eligible
for
dismissal
with
prejudice?
justice
stevens
would
it
be
permissible
in
your
view
for
a
trial
judge
to
say,
this
is
the
fifth
time
i
have
had
a
72-day
delay,
two
days
over,
and
normally
i
don't
think
two
days
is
very
much,
but
the
u.s.
attorney
has
done
it
three
times
in
a
row.
i
think
i
will
dismiss
this
with
prejudice
to
let
him
know.
justice
stevens
well,
say
10,
10
72-day
ones.
say
the
internal
procedures
in
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
just
seemed
regularly
to
not
meet
the
70-day
one,
but
they
always
got
in
within
75
days.
could
the
judge
sooner
or
later
say
i
think
i'll
dismiss
it?
justice
stevens
and
he
can
rely
on
what
happened
in
other
cases
as
a
basis
for
doing
that.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
covered
by
the
briefs,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
anything...
the
states
also
have
equivalent
requirements
of
prompt
trial
within
a
fixed
number
of
days,
at
least
a
number
of
states
do.
do
you
know
if
the
normal
remedy
that
applies
in
the
states
is
dismissal
with
prejudice
or
without
prejudice?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
it
wouldn't
be
controlling
anyway.
my
recollection
of
illinois
was
the
other
way
around;
that
it
was
a
flat
prohibition--
