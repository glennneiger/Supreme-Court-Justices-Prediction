mr.
kneedler,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
section
of
the
criminal
rules
is
it
that
speaks
of
dismissal
of
indictments
with
prejudice
or
without
prejudice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
for
instance,
supposingly
we
were
dealing
with
a
violation
of
other
than
the
speedy
trial
act,
would
a
district
court
have
authority
to
dismiss
an
indictment
with
prejudice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
here
the
speedy
trial
act
itself
authorizes
dismissal
with
prejudice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
loveseth.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
really
is
imputing
an
extraordinary
amount
of
discretion
to
the
district
court
to
say
that
sort
of
shifting
back
and
forth
is
permissible,
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
there
was
a
systemic
problem,
but
you
say
that
was
what
congress...
you
are
not
saying
that
judge
rothstein
thought
there
was
a
systemic
problem
in
the
marshall
service
here.
what
i
read
of
what
she
wrote,
it
does
not
indicate
she
did.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
gives
them
10
days,
and
then
it
creates
a
rebuttable
presumption
after
that.
it
doesn't
give
them
a
flat
10
days
with
everything
cut
off
after
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
loveseth.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-573,
united
states
against
taylor
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
