justice
blackmun
--mr.
kneedler,
if
you
should
prevail
here,
is
there
any
statute
of
limitations
problem
for
the
government
that
exists
with
all
of
the
additional
passage
of
time
when--
justice
blackmun
mr.
loveseth,
do
you
know
where
your
client
is
now?
justice
blackmun
so
you
do
know
where
he
is.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
concerns
the
federal
speedy
trial
act
of
1974,
which
requires
that
an
indictment
be
dismissed
if
the
defendant
is
not
brought
to
trial
within
a
70-day
period.
the
dismissal
is
with
or
without
prejudice
depending
on
the
trial
court's
consideration
of
certain
statutory
factors
such
as
the
seriousness
of
the
offense,
the
circumstances
that
led
to
the
dismissal,
and
the
impact
of
reprosecution
on
the
administration
of
the
act
and
of
justice.
this
respondent
failed
to
appear
for
his
trial
on
federal
narcotics
charges
and
the
trial
was
scheduled
to
be
held
just
one
day
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
70-day
period.
fifteen
days
not
otherwise
excludable,
elapsed
between
his
arrest
in
california
and
the
issuance
by
a
grand
jury
in
seattle
of
a
superseding
indictment.
respondent's
return
to
seattle
was
delayed
for
various
reasons
including
the
government's
sole
processing
and
arrangements
for
transportation.
the
district
court
dismissed
with
prejudice,
finding
that
what
it
called
the
government's
“lackadaisical
attitude”
was
inexcusable
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse.
the
act
establishes
a
framework
which
guides
a
district
court's
determination
as
to
whether
to
dismiss
with
or
without
prejudice
and
appellate
court
review
of
such
determination.
and
we
conclude
that
on
this
record,
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
deciding
to
bar
reprosecution.
it
did
not
explain
how
it
factored
in
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
with
which
the
respondent
was
charged
and
also
seemingly
ignored
was
respondent's
own
illicit
contribution
to
--
or
in
his
failure
to
appear
for
trial.
justice
white
has
joined
the
opinion
but
has
filed
a
concurring
statement.
justice
scalia
has
joined
the
opinion
except
its
part
2(a)
and
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part.
and
justice
stevens
with
whom
justice
brennan
and
justice
marshall
have
joined
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
