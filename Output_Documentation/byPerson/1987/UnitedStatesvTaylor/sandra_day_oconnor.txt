justice
o'connor
mr.
kneedler.
justice
o'connor
what
is
the
standard
on
appellate
review?
is
it
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
o'connor
mr.
loveseth,
do
you
think
that
the
trial
court
though
has
a
duty
to
consider
any
prejudice
to
the
defendant
in
making
a
decision
whether
to
dismiss
with
prejudice
to
the
state?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
trial
court
should
be
required
to
consider
them?
justice
o'connor
well,
in
this
case,
i
gather
the
defendant
would
have
to
remain
in
jail
in
any
event
because
of
the
new
charge
of
leaving
before
the
trial
and
so
forth?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
none
of
this
would
have
happened
if
he
hadn't
fled
the
scene
in
the
first
place,
would
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
except
he
wouldn't
have
to
be
returned
from
california
had
he
not
left
washington.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
loveseth,
it
is,
after
all,
somewhat
of
a
burden
for
the
state
if
the
case
is
dismissed
without
prejudice.
it
requires
them
to
start
all
over
again.
so
it
isn't
as
though
there
isn't
some
penalty
being
imposed
by
virtue
of
just
dismissing
it
without
prejudice;
isn't
that
right?
