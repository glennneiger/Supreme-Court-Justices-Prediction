justice
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
in
deciding
whether
there
was
an
abusive
discretion
in
dismissing
with
prejudice
rather
than
without
prejudice,
do
you
think
it's
proper
for
us
to
take
into
account
that
there
was
a
subsisting
charge
which
was
not
dismissed
and
for
which
the
judge
imposed
the
maximum
penalty,
which
he
might
not
have
done
had
the
other
count
not
been
dismissed?
justice
scalia
he
got
five
years
for
what,
what
was
the
other
offense?
i
forget.
justice
scalia
for
not
showing
up
a
trial,
right;
failure
to
appear.
justice
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
suppose
i
agree
with
you
on
that
that
it
is
beyond
the
bounds
of
discretion,
and
suppose
i
also
agree
with
you
that
it
would
have
been
improper
for
the
court
to
make
up
for
one
mistake
by
making
a
second
mistake,
giving
too
high
a
sentence
on
the
flight
charge,
where
does
that
leave
me?
that
means
i
can
correct
one
mistake,
but
leave
the
other
mistake
there.
i
mean
what
if
the
district
judge
knew,
well,
gee,
if
this
thing
isn't
going
to
be
dismissed
with
prejudice
and
he's
going
to
get
some
time
on
this
drug
charge,
i
really
wouldn't
have
given
him
five
years.
justice
scalia
we
don't
know
it
wasn't
either,
though.
justice
scalia
do
we
know
it
will
be
the
same
judge?
it
won't
be
the
same
judge.
it
will
be
in
a
different...
it
will
be
in
a
different
court
now,
won't
it?
justice
scalia
i
thought
it
was
in
the
record
that
the
reason
for
the
delay
in
sending
him
back
up
to
washington
was
the
marshall
was
waiting
to
get
together
a
bunch
of
prisoners
so
that
the
cost
of
transporting
them
would
be
less.
justice
scalia
is
that
in
the
record,
mr.
kneedler?
