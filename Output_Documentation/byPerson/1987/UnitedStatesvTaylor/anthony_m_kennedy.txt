justice
kennedy
you
don't
bring
to
us
the
question
whether
or
not
the
clock
should
have
been
restarted
for
the
full
70
days?
justice
kennedy
you
did
argue
it
below?
justice
kennedy
mr.
kneedler,
when
the
trial
judge
considered
this
matter,
did
she
take
testimony
for
the
marshall
service?
justice
kennedy
well,
the
judge
was
obviously
disturbed
about
something
the
government
said
or
did
in
order
to
make
the
finding
that
the
government
had
a
lackadaisical
attitude.
justice
kennedy
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that;
is
that
your
position?
justice
kennedy
there
was
an
affidavit
from
dea.
no
affidavit
from
the
marshall,
affidavit
from
the
united
states
attorney?
justice
kennedy
--i
take
it
you
don't
defend
the
position
of
the
marshall
service
that
they
were
waiting
to
get
a
bus
for
a
group
of
prisoners,
that
they
had
the
absolute
duty
to
transport
this
one
prisoner
immediately;
is
that
your
understanding?
justice
kennedy
is
there
a
provision
in
the
statute
which
allows
delays
for
transportation
purposes?
justice
kennedy
well,
surely
you
don't
suggest
that
his
deliberate
flight
is
an
irrelevant
circumstance
to
a--
justice
kennedy
--all
right.
justice
kennedy
in
future
cases
when
you
represent
the
defendant
in
sentencing,
will
you
concede
the
fact
that...
that
the
fact
and
circumstance
that
an
indictment
has
been
dismissed
without
prejudice
should
be
considered
adversely
to
your
client
on
the
remaining
charges?
justice
kennedy
what
about
the
severe
sentence
in
this
case?
is
it
appropriate
for
a
trial
judge
to
increase
the
sentence
on
the
remaining
count
in
view
of
the
dismissal
of
the
other
ones?
that's
appropriate,
isn't
it?
justice
kennedy
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
