mr.
harold
a.
ross
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondents,
amtrak
and
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
cannot
agree
with
the
petitioner's
position
that
one
may
weave
out
of
the
fabric
of
the
alternate
union
membership
provisions
in
section
2
eleventh
a
suit
that
treats
with
grievance
handling
by
rival
union.
it
is
generally
accepted
that
management
and
labor
enjoy
a
wide
freedom
to
develop
their
own
collective
bargaining
relationship
through
the
process
of
collective
bargaining.
as
a
corollary
to
that
freedom,
they
have
the
authority
and
in
fact
the
responsibility
to
provide
a
cost
effective
and
efficient
method
for
the
processing
and
administration
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
system
in
the
railroad
industry
is
well
developed.
it
is
a
system
that
is
administered
by
laymen,
not
lawyers.
it
is
a
system
in
which
claims
and
grievances
are
handled
upon
a
documentary
evidence,
evidence
which
laymen
prepare
through
the
exchange
of
letters.
in
the
event
there
is
discipline
or
dismissal
involved,
the
railroad
may
hold
an
investigative
hearing
on
the
property.
that
hearing
is
conducted
by
a
lower
echelon
carrier
official.
that
document
becomes...
that
is
the
transcript
of
that
hearing
becomes
part
of
the
documents
or
the
record
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
in
disposing
of
that
discipline
or
dismissal.
all
parties
here,
including
the
petitioner,
recognize
that
the
collective
bargaining
representative
has
the
authority
to
administer
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
they
all
agree
that
the
individual
employee
may
not
insist
upon
his
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
he
can
only
insist,
under
the
railway
labor
act,
upon
access
to
the
grievance
process
so
that
his
claim
can
he
fairly
resolved.
this
right
of
access
to
the
grievant
is
a
personal
one.
it
is
a
procedural
right.
therefore,
the
parties,
that's
the
collective
bargaining
parties,
may
enter
into
a
collective
bargaining
provision
which
precludes
a
minority
union,
an
attorney
or
any
other
third
party
from
handling
claims
and
grievances
for
the
individual
employee
at
the
company
level.
the
fact
that
the
parties
can
enter
into
such
a
restrictive
provision,
however,
does
not
mean
that
the
collective
bargaining
representative
may
act
arbitrarily
at
the
company
level,
nor
does
it
mean
that
the
carrier
may
deny
the
individual
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
or
deny
him
consideration
of
his
grievance.
the
former
would
permit
an
action
against
the
union
for
a
breach
of
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
latter
would
permit
the
arbitrator,
in
this
case,
the
first
division
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
mr.
harold
a.
ross
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
a.
ross
there
are
two
levels:
the
company
level
would
be
where
you
go
through
the
stages
of
handling
grievances.
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
those
industries
for
example,
they
bar
everyone
except
the
certified
bargaining
representative
processing
grievances
at
that
level,
that
is
through
the
foreman
on
up
to
the
next
immediate
supervisor
and
finally
with
the
chief
operating
officer
who
has
authority
to
handle
claims
and
grievances.
if
that
chief
operating
officer
denies
the
claim,
refuses
to
sustain
the
claim
at
that
point,
then
the
individual
has
the
right
to
go
to
arbitration.
i'm
talking
about
that
stage
with
the
carrier
official.
mr.
harold
a.
ross
once
it
goes
beyond
that
level,
then
the
individual,
as
mr.
miller
indicated,
may
represent
himself
before
the
arbitrator,
the
first
division
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
or
he
may
be
represented
by
any
union
of
his
choice,
or
by
an
attorney.
of
his
choice.
but
i'm
drawing
the
distinction
here
that
at
company
level
proceedings,
the
collective
bargaining
agents
may
enter
into
a
provision
which
restricts
access
to
that
grievance
procedure
to
the
individual
himself
or
to
the
certified
collective
bargaining
representative,
which
in
this
case,
would
be
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers.
that
system
is
analogous
to
the
system
of
grievance
handling
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
except
contrary
to
what
is
done
in
other
industries,
the
individual
may
handle
his
own
grievances
at
these
beginning
stages
on
the
property
handling.
and
as
i
was
going
to
say,
not
only
does
the
individual
have
a
right
to
bring
an
action
against
the
union
if
it
breaches
its
duty
of
fair
representation
in
arbitrarily
acting
against
him
in
these
beginning
stages,
but
in
addition
to
that,
if
the
employer
denies
the
individual
a
full
and
fair
hearing
or
refuses
to
consider
a
claim
or
grievance,
the
first
division
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
may
set
aside
the
action
that
was
taken
by
the
carrier.
and
we
submit
that
there
are
three
basic
fundamental
premises
that
uphold
the
right
of
the
collective
bargaining
representatives
to
enter
into
such
restricted
access
to
the
grievance
process.
the
first
reason
is
is
that
judicial
interpretations
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
also
the
railway
labor
act,
do
not
sanction
minority
or
rival
union
representation
in
the
processing
of
claims
and
grievances.
the
second
reason
is,
contrary
to
what
petitioner
asserts,
the
language
of
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
promote
minority
union
handling
of
grievances
at
the
company
level.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
i
may
make
an
aside
here,
congress
specifically
knew
how
to
use
language,
as
recognized
by
the
lower
courts,
when
it
did
anticipate
that
an
individual
could
be
represented
by
more
than
himself
or
by
the
certified
collective
bargaining
representative,
when
it
used
the
specific
language
that
it
did
in
section
3
first
(j)
of
the
railway
labor
act.
insofar
as
company
handling,
on-the-property
handling,
it
used
different
language
and
that
language
was,
the
usual
manner
of
handling
up
to
and
through
the
chief
operating
officer
of
the
railroad
designated
to
resolve
or
adjust
grievances.
we
submit,
and
this
would
be
consistent
with
all
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
by
the
petitioner,
that
where
you
have
a
usual
manner
here
with
a
railroad
that
came
into
existence
with
its
own
employees
on
january
1,
1983,
and
entered
into
agreements
with
all
of
the
unions
providing
for
exclusive
handling
of
their
grievances
by
the
certified
collective
bargaining
representative
or
by
the
individual,
that
that
becomes
the
usual
manner
of
handling
on
that
property.
and
therefore
the
court
would
never
have
to
reach
the
other
issues
that
have
been
raised
in
this
case,
although
we
think
that
the
first
circuit
was
correct
when
it
ruled
that
operating
employees
of
railroads,
just
as
employees
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
also
employees
who
are
considered
to
be
non-operating
employees,
are
no
different.
that
under
those
circumstances,
as
i
indicated
previously
and
as
accepted
by
leading
scholars
of
the
labor
law,
the
collective
bargaining
representatives
enjoy
this
peculiar
relationship
in
devising
a
grievance
procedure
for
on-the-property
handling.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
in
this
case,
amtrak
and
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
had
a
right
to
enter
into
such
an
agreement
and
they
did
do
so,
and
they've
applied
it
consistently.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
united
transportation
union
entered
into
similar
provisions
which
they
have
consistently
applied
in
the
crafts
that
they
represent,
the
national
railroad
passenger
corporation.
in
addition
to
the
specific
language
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
we
assert
does
not
promote
minority
union
handling
of
claims
and
grievances,
we
also
submit
that
both
the
1934
amendments
to
the
railway
labor
act,
and
also
the
1951
union
shop
provisions
had
as
their
sole
purpose
the
elimination
of
labor
turmoil
and
the
promotion
of
stability
of
industrial
relations
in
the
railroad
industry
by
the
elimination
of
competition
between
unions.
that
proposition
was
stressed
a
number
of
times
in
the
1934
hearings,
both
by
the
draftsman
of
the
legislation,
commissioner
eastman,
joseph
eastman,
and
also
by
the
chief
spokesman
for
labor,
george
harrison,
who
was
the
president
of
the
brotherhood
of
railway
and
airline
clerks,
and
also
chairman
of
the
railway
labor
executives
association.
the
very
purpose
of
the
section
2
rights
and
section
3
process
was
to
eliminate
degrading
the
competition
between
not
only
various
unions
in
the
industry
but
also
company
unions.
and
it
was
stressed
that
these
grievance
procedures
and
the
other
procedures
in
the
act
had
that
as
their
very
purpose.
during
the
questioning
at
the
hearings,
both
commissioner
eastman
and
mr.
harrison
were
asked
questions
in
regard
to
handling
of
grievances
by
more
than
just
the
individual
and
more
than
the
certified
collective
bargaining
representative.
and
both
those
gentlemen
said
that
maybe
we
should
open
it
up,
so
that
you
could
have
minority
unions
handle
grievances
at
company
level
proceedings.
and
mr.
harrison
specifically
said
that
there
is
certain
language
that
could
be
incorporated
into
section
2
fourth.
and
some
of
that
language
has
been
taken
out
of
context
by
the
courts
in
mcelroy
and
the
court
in
taylor
and
used
as
a
basis
for
the
decisions
in
those
cases.
but
if
one
goes
back
and
looks
at
the
record,
the
eastman-harrison
proposal
which
would
have
allowed
what
the
united
transportation
union
is
asking
for
today
was
rejected
by
congress.
that
language
was
never
inserted
into
the
railway
labor
act
of
1934.
then
we
proceed
to
1951.
and
in
the
hearings
on
the
union
shop
amendments
in
1951,
one
of
the
purposes
was
to
do
away
with
the
freeloader.
but
mr.
harrison
again
spoke
in
favor
of
the
union
shop
amendments.
he
was
like
methuselah,
i
guess.
he
was
around
for
along
period
of
time.
and
he
brought
forward
a
lot
of
amendments
to
the
railway
labor
act.
but
again
he
stressed
the
fact
that
there
should
be
an
elimination
of
this
competition
between
unions.
and
he
indicated
on
several
occasions
during
his
testimony
in
response
to
the
conflict
that
existed
between
the
operating
employees
as
to
the
application
of
section
2
eleventh
(a).
see
section
2
eleventh
(a)
would
have
required
the
individual,
even
though
he
was
involved
in
this
very
narrow
problem
that
existed
of
temporary
transfers,
and
as
justice
o'connor's
question
of
my
brother,
miller,
indicated,
this
court
in
rychlik
did
state,
at
least
on
three
occasions,
that
the
purpose
of
section
2
eleventh
(c)
was
to
handle
a
very
narrow
problem,
a
very
specific
problem
and
that
was
solely
for
the
temporary
transfer
of
firemen
to
engineers
and
back,
because
they
would
only
work
a
few
days
in
the
craft,
and
then
they
would
flow
back
into
the
firemen's
rank,
or
the
other
way,
trainmen
going
in
as
conductors,
and
then
back.
the
idea
was
for
that
two
week
period,
it
was
testified
to
by
mr.
sea,
he
didn't
have
to
change
into
the
other
union.
but
there
was
no
indication
in
any
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
that
the
individual
could
hang
out
the
rest
of
his
life
and
belong
to
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
or
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
firemen
and
enginemen.
and
mr.
harrison
said
that
in
his
testimony.
he
said
that
on
several
occasions
that
it
is
expected
that
an
individual,
once
he
is
regularly
assigned
as
a
locomotive
engineer,
will
join
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers.
the
united
transportation
union
is
now
attempting
to
change
that
reading
of
the
statute,
now
broadening
it--
mr.
harold
a.
ross
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
was
the
intent
of
the
draftsman
that
yes,
that
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive--
mr.
harold
a.
ross
--for
the
purposes
of
deciding
this
case,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
has
to
go
that
far.
i'm
saying
in
response
to
mr.
miller's
comments
that
i
believe
that
when
one
sits
down
and
reads
the
legislative
history
of
the
1951
union
shop
amendments
and
knows
anything
about
the
railroad
industry,
it
was
never
intended
that
that
language
was
to
go
beyond
the
temporary
transfer.
but
this
court
in
ruling
in
this
case
doesn't
even
have
to
deal
with
that
because
section
2
eleventh
(c)
has
nothing
to
do
whatsoever
with
grievance
handling.
and
as
i've
indicated,
mr.
harrison,
the
chief
spokesman
on
union
shop
indicated
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
neither
of
the
respondents,
no
one
has
cited
to
a
statement
that
mr.
harrison
made
in
the
senate
committee
hearings
on
the
union
shop
amendments,
but
he
stated
at
page
16
of
those
1951
hearings
that
if
the
union
shop
amendments
were
passed,
the
grievance
procedure
will
cease
to
be
a
battleground
for
rival
unions;
his
language,
not
mine.
and
i
suggest
that
actually
that
was
the
intent
and
purpose
of
2
eleventh,
and
it
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
grievance
handling.
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
i
think
that
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
the
cornerstone
of
the
federal
labor
policy
has
been
majority
rule.
this
court
as
early
as
1937
in
the
railway
labor
act
case
of
virginia
rr
v.
system
federation
stated
that
a
carrier
had
the
duty
to
meet
and
treat
with
the
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
craft,
and
no
other.
that
concept
in
the
negotiation
of
agreements
has
been
extended
to
the
enforcement
of
those
agreements.
it
was
extended
to
the
enforcement
of
those
agreements
in
hughes
tool
v.
national
labor
relations
board,
which
has
been
cited
with
approval
by
this
court
on
a
number
of
occasions.
in
black-clawson
co.
v.
international
ass'n
of
machinists,
another
case
that
seems
to
be
cited
by
the
court
frequently,
that
court
went
so
far
to
accept
an
argument
of
professor
cox
of
harvard
law
school,
and
stated
that
the
collective
bargaining
representatives
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
could,
by
collective
bargaining,
eliminate
not
only
a
minority
union
handling
grievances
and
arbitrations
of
employees'
claims
under
that
act,
but
they
could
go
so
far
as
to
eliminate
an
employee
having
the
individual
right
to
confer
with
the
employer
concerning
the
claim
or
grievance.
there's
a
very
complex
scheme
of
federal
labor
policy
that
has
evolved
over
the
years.
there
are
rights
that
the
individual
employees
have.
i've
indicated
two
of
those
rights
previously.
in
addition
to
the
two
that
i
mentioned,
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
also
the
ability
of
the
arbitrator
to
set
aside
the
carrier's
failure
to
allow
an
individual
a
full
hearing,
we
also
know
that
section
2
ninth
of
the
railway
labor
act
was
inserted
so
that
if
a
group
of
employees
was
dissatisfied
with
the
majority
representative,
they
had
a
way
under
the
procedures
before
the
mediation
board
to
do
away
with
that
union.
we
also
know,
as
this
court
emphasized
in
several
cases
including
nlrb
v.
allis
chalmers,
that
there
have
been
other
statutory
limitations
or
provisions
for
the
protection
of
individuals
and
among
those
would
be
the
lander
and
griffin
act
which
allows
certain
bill
of
rights
to
those
individuals
and
that
would
be
applicable
in
this
case.
on
the
basis
of
all
of
this,
the
respondents,
national
railroad
passenger
corporation
and
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
would
request
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
