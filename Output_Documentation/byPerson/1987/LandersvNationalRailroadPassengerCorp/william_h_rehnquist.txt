chief

william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-2037,
paul
g.
landers
versus
national
railroad
passenger
corporation.
mr.
miller,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
miller,
section
153
first
(j)
provides
that
in
proceedings
before
the
railroad
adjustment
board,
you
will
have
counsel
of
your
choice,
doesn't
it,
or
union
of
your
choice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
the
alternate
representation
certainly
means
something
there.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
does
mean,
doesn't
it,
that
the
right
to
be
represented
by
the
union
of
your
choice
is
effective
at
that
level?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
it's
not
just
a
social
club.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
ross.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ross.
mr.
miller,
you
have
eleven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
the
case
is
submitted.
