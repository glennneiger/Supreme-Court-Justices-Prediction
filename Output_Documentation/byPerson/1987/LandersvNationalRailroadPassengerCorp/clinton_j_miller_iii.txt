mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
subsection
in
the
union
shop
provision
in
the
railway
labor
act,
section
2
eleventh
(c)
passed
in
1951
which
differs
significantly
from
that
in
the
labor
management
relations
act
as
it
relates
to
operating
employees
only
on
this
nation's
railroads
comprised
of
engineers,
firemen
and
hostlers,
conductors
and
trainmen.
on
its
face,
section
2
eleventh
(c)
permits
satisfaction
of
a
negotiated
union
shop
agreement
with
one
of
the
two
remaining
operating
craft
unions
by
membership
in
the
other,
the
minority
union.
the
two
provisos
in
section
2
eleventh
(c)
make
the
alternate
membership
choice
peculiar
to
railroad
operating
employees
clear
beyond
doubt.
they
provide
that
an
employee
not
belonging
to
any
union
on
the
effective
date
of
a
union
shop
obligation
covering
operating
employees
may
be
required
to
belong
to
the
union
representing
the
craft
or
class,
but
such
an
employee
in
the
second
proviso
or
any
employee
in
the
operating
crafts
has
the
unfettered
right
to
change
affiliations
to
a
qualified
organization.
there
are
only
two
left:
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers;
and,
the
united
transportation
union.
no
agreement
can
change
these
statutory
rights.
the
petitioner
here
was
an
engineer
on
amtrak
in
february
1984,
after
having
been
an
engineer
on
the
consolidated
rail
corporation
and
its
predecessor
for
many
years.
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
is
the
certified
representative
for
engineers
on
amtrak.
but
the
petitioner
belonged
to
the
united
transportation
union
and
in
fact
was
a
local
officer,
and
continues
to
be,
of
the
united
transportation
union.
he
performed
passenger
engineer
service
for
conrail
and
its
predecessors
under
an
operating
agreement
with
amtrak
until
1981
when
the
northeast
rail
service
act
mandated
direct
operation
by
amtrak,
and
amtrak
commenced
that
direct
operation
january
1,
1983,
as
mandated
by
the
northeast
rail
service
act
which
does
provide
in
an
agreement
negotiated
pursuant
to
that
act
for
flow
back
rights
to
conrail.
in
february,
1984,
while
working
as
a
passenger
engineer
on
amtrak,
mr.
landers
was
noticed
for
an
investigation
on
the
property
of
amtrak
relative
to
his
violation,
an
alleged
violation
of
an
operating
rule.
according
to
what
had
been
his
experience,
particularly
on
conrail,
and
while
working
for
conrail
providing
amtrak
service,
petitioner
asked
for
utu
representative
to
be
present.
his
request
was
denied
by
the
carrier,
amtrak,
because
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers,
amtrak's
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
an
exclusive
representation
clause
with
regard
to
on-property
investigations
and
with
regard
to
the
handling
of
time
and
grievance
claims
on
the
property.
whereupon,
he
filed
this
action
seeking
temporary,
preliminary
and
permanent
injunctive
relief,
as
well
as
declaratory
relief.
and
he
sought
that
relief
from
the
qualification
on
his
right
to
have
his
representative,
the
union
of
membership
present
at
the
most
critical
moment
during
employment,
an
investigation
on
the
property
leading
to
discipline.
during
the
pendency
of
this
case,
an
investigation
was
held,
a
suspension
was
issued,
it
has
been
served,
and
the
petitioner
is
now
back
to
work.
after
a
bench
trial
on
essentially
undisputed
facts
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
rejected
the
jurisdictional
challenges
of
the
respondents,
finding
that
the
issue
was
one
of
statutory
construction
on
the
permissibility
of
an
agreement
provision.
but
it
entered
judgment
for
the
respondents
finding
that
the
right
to
alternate
membership,
which
it
did
not
dispute,
and
the
legitimate
interest
in
representation
by
the
union
of
membership
in
disciplinary
investigation
were
subservient
to
the
exclusivity
representation
principles
in
the
balance
of
the
railway
labor
act.
on
rebut,
the
first
circuit
affirmed,
borrowing
heavily
from
what
it
referred
to
as
the
analogous
precincts
of
the
lmra.
although
it
recognized
the
absolute
right
to
alternate
membership
and
the
legitimate
interest
of
an
employee
in
having
the
union
of
membership
be
present
at
a
disciplinary
hearing,
it
decided
that
on
the
basis
of
exclusivity
principles
in
the
railway
labor
act
itself,
and
flowing
over
from
the
national
labor
relations
act,
that
this
right
could
be
reduced
to
an
absurdity
that
petitioner
asked
this
court
to
correct.
before
the
decision
below,
the
circuit
court
precedent
on
this
issue
was
uniform
in
both
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
mcelroy
case
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
recently
decided
taylor
case
decided
that
section
2
eleventh
(c)
of
the
railway
labor
act
was
key
to
a
resolution
of
this
issue.
both
recognized
that
a
determination
that
one
was
entitled
to
alternate
membership
only
without
having
the
assistance
of
the
union
of
choice
at
a
disciplinary
investigation
or
to
handle
a
time
and
grievance
claim
was
a
naked
legal
right
unaccompanied
by
any
of
the
ordinary
material
benefits
of
membership.
in
fact,
the
taylor
court
stated
that
it
reduced
the
statutorily
protected
right
to
alternate
membership
to
that
of
membership
in
a
mere
social
club.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
i
would
hasten
to
add
that
subsection
3
first
(j)
is
applicable
to
all
unions,
non-operating
crafts
as
well
as
operating
crafts,
which
this
court
was
at
pains
to
point
out
in
pennsylvania
railroad
against
rychlik.
this
alternate
membership
provision
has
no
applicability
whatever
to
virtually
70
percent
of
railroad
employees.
it
only
covers
operating
crafts.
three
first
(j)
is
applicable
across
craft
lines.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
that
is
correct
to
an
extent.
however,
the
record
in
railroad
proceedings
leading
to
discipline,
as
this
court
knows,
is
fixed
by
the
investigation
on
the
property.
the
record
cannot
be
changed.
arbitration
under
section
3
of
the
act,
mandatory
arbitration,
cannot
change
that
existing
record.
it
is
basically
a
de
novo
review
of
the
record
made
on
the
property
of
the
carrier,
and
in
that
respect
is
materially
different
from
arbitration
under
the
nlra.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
3
first
(j)
grants
an
unqualified
right
to
any
representative
of
choice.
counsel
may
be
present
at
that
point
at
the
nrab.
and
while
it
is
true
that
the
union
of
membership
may
take
over
at
that
point,
so
many
any
representative.
and
that
does
not
give
effect
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
later
enacted
provision,
subsection
2
eleventh
(c)
because
it
provides
that
one
may
satisfy
union
shop
obligation
by
being
a
member
and
have
the
assistance
of
that
member
in
making
the
record
that
will
serve
as
the
basis
for
any
further
proceedings
with
regard
to
discipline
or
a
time
or
grievance
claim.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
justice
kennedy,
the
general
rule
is
often
stated
that
one
may
not
raise
anything
in
arbitration
that
has
not
been
dealt
with
on
the
property,
that
has
not
been
raised
on
the
property.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
justice
kennedy.
he
is
allowed
to
appear
and
plead
his
case
but
the
record
is
made
by
the
handling
on
the
property.
the
court
below
also
made
much
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
so-called
shuttling
between
a
fireman
craft
and
an
engineer
craft
on
amtrak
as
a
new
employer.
because
in
the
corridor
operation
from
which
these
facts
arise,
there
were
no
firemen.
however,
the
presence
of
shuttling
would
be
equally
applicable
to
any
analysis
as
to
whether
alternate
membership
was
permitted.
and
the
court
below
did
not
dispute
at
all,
and
in
fact
held
consistent
with
virtually
uniform
precedent
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
have
a
right
to
alternate
membership.
the
absence
of
presence
of
shuttling
is
not
contained
anywhere
in
section
2
eleventh
(c).
the
lower
court
did
not
think
it
had
any
effect
with
respect
to
membership.
it
should
not
have
any
effect
with
respect
to
the
assistance
of
the
union
of
membership
in
an
on-the-property
investigation.
three
decisions
from
this
court
are
a
key
to
the
resolution
of
the
issue
present
here.
the
first
case
is
pennsylvania
r.r.
v.
rychlik
where
this
court
limited
the
applicability
of
the
alternate
membership
choice
to
those
unions
having
qualified
electors
on
the
first
division
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
in
accordance
with
section
3
first
(h)
of
the
act.
that
qualification
did
not
appear
plainly
on
the
face
of
the
statute
but
as
this
court
noted,
it
was
the
established
unions
which
drafted
the
language
into
eleventh
(c).
moreover,
the
purpose
of
the
passage
of
the
statute
was
not
to
open
up
the
field
to
brand
new
unions
such
as
existed
in
the
rychlik
case.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
justice
o'connor,
i
would
agree
that
there
was
much
discussion
about
the
limited
purpose
to
eliminate
the
problem
of
free
riders,
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
issue
that
was
in
front
of
the
court
was
itself
a
very
limited
one
at
that
time.
the
only
holding
in
the
case
was
that
uroc,
the
brand
new
union,
was
not
a
union
that
was
qualified
to
be
available
for
alternate
membership.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
justice
o'connor,
i
guess
all
i
can
say
in
response
is
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
was
required
to
go
as
far
as
we
are
seeking
here
because
of
the
limited
issue
that
was
involved.
but
i
do
think
that--
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
--no,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't,
because
i
believe
you're
referring
to
3
first
(i),
the
usual
manner
handling
which
was
passed
in
1934.
the
point
here
is
that
we
have
a
very
specific
statute
with
very
plain
language
with
regard
to
membership
which
is
the
later
enactment
which
is
specifically
keyed
to
a
problem
existing
only
among
operating
employees.
for
that
reason,
i
do
not
believe
that
section
3
first
(i)
could
be
construed
to
be
an
absolute
bar
to
the
later
enactment
of
section
2
eleventh
(c).
and
in
that
regard,
the
usual
manner
that
is
referred
to
and
is
usually
under
the
control
of
the
carrier
and
the
organizations
on
the
property
must
be
modified
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
membership
provisions
and
the
alternate
membership
provisions
of
subsection
2
eleventh
(c)
if
it's
to
have
any
real
meaning.
this
court
has
before
and
two
years
after
the
rychlik
case
invalidated
other
provisions
in
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
inhibited
another
right
under
subsection
2
eleventh
(b).
that
right
was
the
right
to
revoke
a
dues
checkoff
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
the
organization
with
the
carrier.
the
facts
of
the
case
were
such
that
the
union
holding
the
agreement,
so
to
speak,
the
representative,
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
in
its
bargaining
agreement
with
the
carrier
required
that
the
employee
use
the
union's
form
only
to
make
the
revocation.
this
court
found
no
support
in
either
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
itself
or
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
such
a
view,
and
therefore
invalidated
that
provision.
and
i
might
note
that
in
so
invalidating
that
provision,
this
court
in
felter
specifically
recognized
that
one
of
the
reasons
an
employee
may
revoke
was
to
give
effect
to
the
second
proviso
of
subsection
2
eleventh
(c)
which
was
left
open
for
solicitation
by
the
remaining
two
rival
unions.
the
third
case
from
this
court
that
is
important
to
resolution
of
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
elgin,
j.
&
e.
ry
v.
burley
case
where
this
court
decided
that
individual
rights
under
the
railway
labor
act
are
materially
different
than
they
are
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
union
does
not
control
arbitration.
arbitration
under
the
railway
labor
act
is
statutory.
and
an
individual
does
not
have
to
go
to
the
union
to
exercise
his
or
her
right
to
that
arbitration
under
the
act.
and
any
qualification
on
that
right
by
means
of
a
settlement
between
the
union
and
the
carrier
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
the
railroad
employee
was
nullified
by
this
court's
decision
on
the
burley
case.
in
that
respect,
we
would
submit
that
the
statutory
right
to
alternate
membership
under
subsection
2
eleventh
(c)
cannot
be
nullified
by
reducing
the
right
that
these
operating
employees
have
to
an
absurdity
or
to
mere
membership
in
a
social
club,
or
relegating
them
to
the
same
rights
that
all
railroad
employees
have
when
the
statute
is
so
specific
with
regard
to
the
rights
to
alternate
membership.
in
this
regard,
this
court
has
before
recognized
that
great
care
must
be
taken
to
import
principles
under
the
lmra
over
into
the
railway
labor
act
arena.
and
we
would
submit
that
that
is
certainly
true
in
this
case.
this
is
a
very
specific
right
to
alternate
membership
key
to
a
narrow
class
of
operating
employees
on
the
railroad.
it
quite
clearly
gives
them
the
right
to
alternate
membership.
that
cannot
be
qualified
by
requiring
the
union
not
of
their
choice
to
handle
the
claims
on
the
property.
the
lmra
cases
cited
by
the
respondents,
those
arising
before
the
effective
date
of
subsection
2
eleventh
(c),
those
not
dealing
with
subsection
2
eleventh
(c)
because
they
deal
with
nonoperating
employees
are
totally
inapplicable
to
a
resolution
in
this
case.
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
right
to
alternate
membership
plain
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
with
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
otherwise.
this
case
is
truly
devoid
of
the
mischief
that
is
claimed
will
be
worked
by
the
respondents.
the
petitioner
here
did
exactly
what
he
had
done
for
years
while
performing
service
on
conrail.
and
that
carrier
was
recently
successfully
sold
by
the
government
and
no
peculiar
labor
relations
problems
occurred
on
that
property.
if
there
is
to
be
the
full
exclusivity
that
is
present
in
the
lmra
and
with
regard
to
non-operating
employees
to
be
applied
in
this
case,
we
would
submit
that
that
is
for
the
congress
to
decide.
it
is
a
policy
matter.
there
was
no
dispute
even
by
the
court
below
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
an
absolute
right
to
alternate
membership.
and
although
the
court
below
recognized
his
legitimate
interest
in
having
his
own
union
establish
the
record
at
the
most
critical
moment
of
employment
leading
to
discipline
on
the
property,
it
effectively
overrode
that
legitimate
interest
by
applying
exclusivity
principles
from
an
act
in
this
case
clearly
not
an
analogous.
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
clinton
j.
miller,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
ross
continues
to
not
give
effect
to
section
2
eleventh
(c)
of
the
railway
labor
act.
it
is
not
enough
to
say
what
professor
cox
or
other
legal
scholars
think
about
exclusivity
principles.
it
is
not
enough
to
cavil
with
regard
to
the
legislative
history.
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
is
supportive
of
the
position
here.
we're
not
talking
about
the
1934
amendments,
we're
talking
about
1951
insertion
of
subsection
2
eleventh
(c)
into
the
railway
labor
act.
the
point
of
the
mcelroy
and
taylor
courts'
discussion
of
the
eastman
and
harrison
testimony
and
its
relationship
to
other
sections
of
the
railway
labor
act
such
as
2
second,
2
third
and
2
sixth
is
that
all
of
those
sections
are
keyed
to
the
designation
of
representatives.
there
is
only
one
class
of
employees
in
the
entire
country
that
have
a
right
to
designate
a
representative
other
than
the
representative
certified
by
either
the
nlrb
or
the
national
mediation
board
and
those
are
operating
employees.
they
designate
that
representative
by
opting
for
the
alternate
membership
provisions
of
subsection
2
eleventh
(c).
they
are
the
only
ones
that
have
that
right.
if
they
have
that
right
to
alternate
membership,
it
must
come
with
something
other
than
a
mere
defense
to
a
union
shop
charge
that
could
be
brought
by
the
contract
holder.
it
is,
as
both
the
mcelroy
and
taylor
courts
point
out,
something
that
must
come
with
more
attributes
than
one
would
get
by
belonging
to
a
social
club.
with
regard
to
the
1951
amendments,
it
was
not
mr.
harrison's
testimony
that
was
critical
at
all.
in
fact,
mr.
harrison
was
a
non-operating
craft
president.
the
statute
was
left
in
a
state
of
disarray
until
january
1,
1951,
when
all
of
the
operating
craft
unions
except
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
agreed
on
the
language
in
section
2
eleventh
(c).
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
an
employee
choosing
the
alternate
membership
has
a
right
to
sue
the
contract
holder
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
where
bad
faith
has
to
be
shown.
the
right
to
alternate
membership
must
carry
with
it
the
attribute
of
representing
on
the
property
in
minor
disputes,
only.
this
works
no
intrusion
whatever
into
the
general
exclusivity
with
regard
to
the
negotiation
and
administration
of
agreements,
and
all
of
the
courts
have
recognized
that,
mcelroy
and
taylor
included.
in
sum,
your
honors,
when
in
doubt
as
to
the
legislative
history,
we
consult
the
statute,
and
on
that
basis
the
petitioner
seeks
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
