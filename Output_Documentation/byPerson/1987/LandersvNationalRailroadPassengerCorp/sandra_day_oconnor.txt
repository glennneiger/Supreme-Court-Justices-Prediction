justice
o'connor
mr.
miller,
i
wonder
whether
the
court
in
the
pennsylvania
railroad
case
didn't
take
a
much
more
limited
view
of
section
2
eleventh
(c)
than
you
are
advocating
here.
i
thought
the
court
said
it
had
a
very
narrow
and
limited
purpose?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
strikes
me
that
you're
asking
for
a
much
broader
interpretation
of
that
section
than
i
thought
the
court
had
given
it.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
section
3
first
would
possibly
take
precedence
here
in
telling
us
what
to
do
on
these
specific
grievances?
