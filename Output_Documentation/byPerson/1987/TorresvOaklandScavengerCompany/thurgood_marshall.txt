whole
purpose
to
assess
costs
as
to
who

to
be
responsible
for
the
costs?

i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
here,
we
hold
that
failure
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
in
compliance
with
the
specificity
requirement
of
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
3(c)
presents
a
jurisdictional
bar
to
that
appeal.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
affirmed.
justice

has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and

has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
