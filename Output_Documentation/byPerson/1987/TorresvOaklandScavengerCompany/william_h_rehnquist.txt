rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
number
86-1845,
jose
torres
v.
oakland
scavenger
company,
et
al.--
very
well,
mr.
yturbide,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
yturbide,
supposing
that
instead
of
reversing
the
dismissal
the
court
of
appeals
had
affirmed
the
dismissal,
and
the
appellees
had
sought
sanctions
against
those
who
appealed.
now,
i
suppose
your
client
would
not
have
been
liable
for
those
sanctions,
even
though
the
other
15
might
have
been.
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
didn't
expose
himself
to
any
possible
sanctions
as
a
result
of
his
appeal--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--because
he
wasn't
named
as
a
party.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
weren't
petitioning
for
certiorari,
mr.
yturbide.
you
were
appealing
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
governed
by
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
yturbide.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
mckae.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
really
isn't
before
us
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mckae.
mr.
yturbide,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
yturbide,
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-1845,
torres
against
oakland
scavenger
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
