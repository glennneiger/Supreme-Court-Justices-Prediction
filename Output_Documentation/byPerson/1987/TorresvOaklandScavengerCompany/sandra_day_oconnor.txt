justice
o'connor
there
is
no
provision,
mr.
yturbide,
i
take
it
in
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
to
permit
a
motion
to
amend
the
notice
of
appeal?
justice
o'connor
i
take
it
there
is
no
provision
in
the
appellate
rules
for
amending
a
notice
of
appeal.
justice
o'connor
does
rule
2
possibly
encompass
some
authority
to
suspend
any
of
the
rules
for
good
cause
shown?
justice
o'connor
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
the
request
to
amend
the
notice
had
been
filed
earlier
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
how
about
beyond
the
60
days?
would
your
response
be
just
as
it
is
now?
