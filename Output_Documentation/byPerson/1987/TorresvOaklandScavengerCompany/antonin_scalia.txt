justice
scalia
mr.
yturbide,
suppose
the
same
thing
had
happened,
the
same
clerical
error
in
omitting
the
name
of
one
of
the
plaintiffs
at
the
complaint
stage,
and
you
could
show
the
same
thing
as
here,
that
this
individual
was
really
meant
to
be
included,
and
it
was
purely
a
clerical
error
that
he
was
not
included.
justice
scalia
but
the
court
of
appeals
has
separate
jurisdictional
requirements.
everything
that
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
necessarily
have
jurisdiction
over.
it
is
a
jurisdictional
act
just
as
the
filing
of
the
complaint
is
a
jurisdictional
act,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
why
did
you
think
they
called
attention
to
it
in
the
footnote?
and
i
mean
i--
justice
scalia
--if
they
didn't
intend
to
rely
upon
it
for
anything.
i
mean,
that
is
what
your
presentation
to
this
court
suggests,
that
you
thought
it
was
immaterial.
they
wouldn't
have
mentioned
it
if
they
thought
it
was
immaterial,
would
they?
justice
scalia
there
were
no
absent
class
members
who
were
in
the
case
at
the
time
of
this
appeal
because
the
class--
justice
scalia
--to
say
potentially
there
were
is
to
say
there
were
not.
there
was
simply
no
class
at
the
time
of
this
appeal.
the
class
had
not
been
certified.
justice
scalia
well,
does
it
prove
that
they
are
representative,
or
doesn't
prove
than
when
you
are
certified
as
a
class
you
take
the
case
in
the
status
in
which
it
exists,
you
come
into
it
given
all
of
its
frailties
and
weaknesses,
including
whatever
has
been
established
by
a
prior
appeal
before
you
came
in?
