mr.
stephen
mckae
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
one
irreducible
fact
in
this
case
is
that
jose
torres
did
not
file
a
notice
of
appeal
from
the
1981
dismissal
of
this
action.
it
is
not
that
a
notice
suggesting
that
all
appellants
or
all
original
plaintiffs
were
appealing
was
filed.
it
was
a
notice
that
specifically
named
each
of
the
15
who
made
that
timely
notice,
and
excluded
jose
torres.
the
omission
of
mr.
torres's
name
was
noted
in
oakland
scavenger
company's
brief
on
appeal.
contrary
to
what
has
been
suggested
about
the
indication
that
this
may
have
been
the
result
of
clerical
error,
what
the
footnote
in
the
brief
stated
was
that
mr.
torres's
name
had
been
apparently
omitted
from
the
caption
in
the
original
complaint
by
error,
but
the
footnote
stated
that
mr.
torres
had
not
filed
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
it
further
stated
that
he
had
also
not
been
certified
by
counsel
under
ninth
circuit
rule
13
as
a
party
having
an
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
litigation.
so
there
were
two
indications
in
that
footnote
that
mr.
torres
was
not
participating
in
that
appeal,
and
despite
that
indication,
counsel
did
not
make
mention
of
this
fact
in
his
reply
brief
to
the
court.
there
was
nothing
stated
on
the
papers
and
there
was
nothing
stated
at
oral
argument
to
suggest
that
oakland
scavenger
company
was
incorrect
in
its
understanding
that
mr.
torres
did
not
have
an
interest
and
was
not
participating
in
this
appeal.
after
the
reversal
in
the
ninth
circuit
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
in
this
court,
and
again,
oakland
scavenger
company
noted
that
failure
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
by
mr.
torres.
mr.
torres's
status
was
left
somewhat
indefinite
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
counsel
had
not
responded
to
the
footnote
and
the
court
of
appeal
had
not
made
mention
of
the
fact
that
only
15
of
the
original
le
plaintiffs
had
appealed
when
it
issued
its
decision.
we
on
remand
notified
the
district
court
in
a
status
conference
statement
that
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
would
be
filed
seeking
to
have
the
court's
statement
decision
that
mr.
torres
was
no
longer
entitled
to
participate
in
the
case,
and
that
is
the
order
from
which
counsel
has
taken
an
appeal,
at
least
one
of
the
two
orders
from
which
counsel
has
taken
an
appeal
in
this
case.
a
motion
was
filed
in
district
court.
it
concluded
that
it
had
no
power
to
amend
the
notice
of
appeal,
that
because
mr.
torres
had
not
appealed,
he
was
no
longer
a
participant
in
the
action,
and
the
district
court
awarded
summary
judgment
to
oakland
scavenger
company.
following
that
decision
mr.
torres
filed
an
appeal
with
the
ninth
circuit
which
was
timely.
at
the
same
time
he
filed
a
motion
for
recall
of
the
mandate
from
the
1982
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
that
motion
was
denied
almost
a
year
prior
to
the...
or
better
than
a
year
prior
to
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
matter
which
is
currently
before
the
court.
the
ninth
circuit
upheld
the
district
court's
decision,
and
mr.
torres's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
from
that
decision
was
timely,
but
it
appears
that
his
petition
from
denial
of
the
recall
of
mandate
was
not
timely,
and
that
matter
should
not
currently
be
before
the
court.
that
makes
a
difference
because
if
the
only
matter
which
the
court
is
currently
considering
is
the
summary
judgment
issued
by
the
district
court,
then
it
would
appear
that
the
district
court's
ruling
was
undeniably
correct,
the
district
court
did
not
have
power
to
amend
the
notice,
that
mr.
torres
had
not
filed
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
under
rule
three
he
was
not
a
party
to
the
1982
appeal.
so
the
issues
before
the
court
are
whether
the
district
court
correctly
decided
that
it
did
not
have
authority
to
amend
the
notice,
whether
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
denial
of
the
motion
for
recall
of
mandate
was
timely,
and
then,
and
only
if
the
court
finds
that
that
petition
was
timely,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
abused
its
discretion
in
denying
the
recall
of
mandate
some
four
years
after
the
earlier
appeal.
now,
this
court
has
said
that
the
requirement
for
filing
of
a
timely
appeal
is
mandatory
and
jurisdictional.
the
rules,
that
is,
rule
4
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
does
allow
for
a
filing
of
a
motion
within
60
days
of
the
decision
appealed
from
seeking
to
extend
the
time
for
filing
of
notice
of
appeal
for
excusable
neglect,
but
rule
26
states
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
earlier
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
have
power
to
extend
the
time
for
filing
beyond
that
time
provided
in
rule
4.
so
once
that
60
days
passes,
there
is
no
further
opportunity
under
the
rules
to
seek
relief
in
the
way
of
amendment
of
the
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
stephen
mckae
rule
26
would
seem
to
speak
to
that
explicitly,
justice
o'connor,
and
it
would
seem
that
where
there
is
a
direct
statement
limiting
the
court's
authority
in
rule
26,
that
a
broader
authority
should
not
be
presumed
by
general
language
found
elsewhere
in
the
rules.
mr.
stephen
mckae
if
the
request
to
amend
the
notice
had
been
filed
within
the
40-day
time
period,
that
is,
between
30
and
60
days.
mr.
stephen
mckae
yes,
it
would.
counsel
had
argued
for
a
representative
effect,
suggesting
that
if
any
party,
that
is,
any
appealing
party
in
a
class
action
files
a
timely
notice
of
appeal,
that
that
notice
ought
to
apply
to
any
other.
there
is
no
authority
for
that
position
in
the
rules
or
in
the
decisional
law.
the
rule,
that
is,
rule
3
expressly
states
that
the
notice
of
appeal
shall
specify
the
party
or
parties
who
are
filing
the
appeal.
rule
3
also
speaks
in
terms
of
multiparty
litigation
and
suggests
that
if
there
is
more
than
one
appealing
party
they
may
file
singly
or
they
may
file
separately,
but
as
named
parties
in
class
action
litigation
they
have
an
obligation
to
go
forward.
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
a
named
party
has
any
different
status
in
a
class
action
than
he
has
in
any
other
multiparty
litigation.
and
he
must
go
forward
on
procedural
matters
and
he
must
go
forward
in
making
out
his
case
on
liability.
he
cannot
count
on
being
included
within
the
framework
of
class
relief
if
he
fails
to
make
out
his
own
case.
some
of
the
courts
based
on
this
court's
1962
decision
in
foman
versus
davis
have
suggested
that
a
somewhat
relaxed
or
more
relaxed
approach
ought
to
be
followed
in
circumstances
which
suggest
a
particular
inequity
or
injustice
or
excusable
neglect.
foman
was
concerned
with
an
appeal
which...
or
two
notices
of
appeal
which
were
filed
following
a
judgment,
one
filed
within
the
time,
the
correct
time
following
a
judgment,
but
which
was
premature
because
there
was
a
post-judgment
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment
pending,
and
so
the
time
for
filing
in
foman
was
tolled
by
that
motion.
there
was
also
a
subsequent
notice
filed
following
the
decision
on
the
post-judgment
motion
which
itself
was
timely
but
which
did
not
mention
the
earlier
judgment,
and
this
court
ruled
that
the
two
notices
taken
together
could
be
taken
as
a
single
notice
that
there
was
a
manifest
intent
on
the
part
of
the
appellant
to
file
an
appeal,
not
simply
of
the
denial
of
the
post-judgment
motion,
but
also
of
the
judgment.
but
in
this
case,
there
was
no
reaction
at
all
to
the
note
in
the
brief
stating
that
jose
torres
had
not
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
that
he
was
not
listed
as
a
party
interested
in
the
outcome
of
the
action.
there
was
no
suggestion,
as
i
have
already
stated,
either
in
the
papers
or
in
oral
argument
that
we
were
mistaken
in
our
understanding
of
his
intent.
so,
it
would
not
seem
that
the
notion
of
manifest
intent
that
is
discussed
in
foman,
not
with
respect
to
the
naming
of
the
parties,
but
with
respect
to
the
form
of
the
notice
of
appeal,
and
the
designation
of
orders
appealed
from
would
seem
to
have
any
application
in
this
particular
case.
there
also
does
not
appear
to
have
been
any
excusable
oversight
which
would
justify
an
equitable
kind
of
relief
if
the
court
had
authority
to
grant
that.
the
standard
in
the
ninth
circuit
has
been
clear,
at
least
since
1960,
as
a
result
of
the
cook
and
sons
case,
that
every
party
appealing
must
be
named
in
the
notice
of
appeal,
and
that
parties
who
are
omitted
from
the
notice
of
appeal
will
not
be
considered
to
be
participating.
in
this
particular
case
counsel
has
stated
in
his
brief
to
this
court
that
the
decision
to
take
no
action
was
deliberate,
that
in
balancing
the
risks
of
bringing
the
matter
to
the
court's
attention
he
made
a
determination
that
it
would
not
be
in
his
client's
best
interest
do
to
so,
and
he
states
that
he
feared
that
there
was
a
danger
that
the
attempted
change,
that
is,
a
change
in
the
notice
would
be
perceived
or
regarded
as
a
self-confession
of
his
failure
to
comply
with
the
court
rules.
the
problem
with
an
indefinite
standard,
contrary
to
the
standard
which
has
been
and
consistently
has
been
applied
in
the
ninth
circuit
is
that
it
shifts
the
burden
from
the
appellant
to
the
appellee
to
make
a
determination
as
to
who
is
participating
on
the
appeal.
it
forces
the
appellee
as
occurred
in
this
case
at
some
point
to
make
a
motion
with
the
court
either
at
the
appellate
level
or
at
the
district
court
level
to
obtain
a
clarification
of
that
individual's
status,
and
in
this
particular
case
that
has
exposed
oakland
scavenger
company
to
an
additional
round
of
appeals,
not
only
the
motion,
but
the
fact
that
we
have
come
on
appeal
on
that
item
alone
where
the
matter
might
possibly
have
been
resolved
originally
on
the
first
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
following
the
ninth
circuit's
reversal
of
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
action,
so
there
has
been
considerable
prejudice
to
oakland
scavenger
in
this
matter.
the
proceedings
with
respect
to
what
is
a
collateral
issue
have
been
extended
over
a
period
of
now
four
years,
and
that
would
not
have
occurred
if
there
were
not
some
encouragement
in
the
decisions
of
some
of
the
other
circuits
for
the
motion
that
there
may
be
some
situations
where
the
use
of
terms
such
as
"et
al"
or
some
other
designation
to
suggest
an
intent
to
appeal
would
be
sufficient
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
rule.
some
of
the
circuits
have
suggested
that
there
may
be
a
concept
of
substantial
compliance,
that
use
of
terms
such
as
3(c)
despite
that
requirement
stating
that
all
parties
shall
be
specified.
and
it
certainly
is
important
for
this
court
to
clarify
the
requirement
of
the
rule
and
to
specify
whether--
mr.
stephen
mckae
--i
am
afraid
my
latin
isn't...
strong
enough
to--
mr.
stephen
mckae
--no,
i
don't
think
that
would
under
the
rule,
but
clearly
"et
al"
does
not
even
mean
"and
all
others".
it
simply
as
i
understand
it
means
"and
others"
and
doesn't
indicate
which
among
the
others
are
intended
to
be
included
in
the
appeal.
in
this
case,
however,
that
term
was
not
used
either
in
the
body
of
the
notice.
it
was
used
in
the
caption,
as
is
commonly
the
case
following
the
original
complaint.
mr.
stephen
mckae
well,
the
whole
purpose
is
to
determine
who
is
before
the
court.
mr.
stephen
mckae
that
would
include
assessing
costs
from
the
appellant's
standpoint.
that
would
include
a
decision
as
to
whether
he
wished
to
bear
costs
not
simply
awarded
by
the
court
but
costs
which
he
would
have
to
undertake
with
respect
to
his
own
counsel
in
pursuing
that
appeal,
and
that,
of
course,
is
an
obligation
under
the
rules
of
ethics
in
california,
and
i
am
sure
in
most
if
not
all
other
states
for
the
party
who
is
represented.
but
it
is
also
an
obligation
so
that
the
court
can
determine
who
is
before
it.
in
the
ninth
circuit
it
serves
the
purpose,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
certificate
under
rule
13
of
advising
the
court
with
respect
to
the
possibility
of
recusal
or
disqualification,
and
it
certainly
avoids
the
necessity
of
extended
proceedings
such
as
we
have
had
in
this
case
to
resolve
an
issue
which
could
have
been
resolved
clearly
by
the
naming
of
the
party.
there
has
been
a
question
raised
with
regard
to
the
res
judicata
effect
of
this
decision.
that
was
a
question
which
was
expressly
reserved
by
the
district
court.
the
district
court
declined
to
make
a
ruling
as
to
whether
mr.
torres
would
be
entitled
to
participate
in
relief
if
relief
should
at
some
time
be
granted,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
district
court's
decision
with
respect
to
that
issue
will
have
to
be
that
he
barred,
and
that
the
prior
decision,
having
been
valid
and
on
the
merits
is
a
final
decision
as
to
him,
and
that
he
will
not
be
entitled
to
participate
in
class
relief.
of
course,
there
are
many
people
among
the--
mr.
stephen
mckae
--i
believe
he
does.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
mckae
he
could
be
subject
to
sanctions.
sanctions
in
these
cases
are--
mr.
stephen
mckae
--i
think
that
that
would
be
a
consideration
on
the
part
of
the
court
in
determining
whether
to
award
sanctions.
but
it
would
not
be
a
consideration
with
regard
to
whether
he
is
subject
to
sanctions.
mr.
stephen
mckae
well,
i
think
that's
the
question
as
to
whether
he
is
liable
for
attorneys'
fees
with
respect
to
his
own
counsel,
but
certainly
oakland
scavenger
company
would
have
been
entitled
to
make
the
motion.
in
his
case
i
think
it
is
unlikely
that
the
motion
would
have
been
granted
in
view
of
the
outcome
with
respect
to
the
other
parties.
mr.
stephen
mckae
that
really
isn't,
no.
i
think
unless
there
are
further
questions,
thank
you.
