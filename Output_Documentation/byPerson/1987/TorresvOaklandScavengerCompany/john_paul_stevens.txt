justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
suggestion
about
the
proceeding?
when
was
the
class
certified,
and
how
big
is
the
class?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
so
at
the
time
the
summary
judgment
against
him
was
entered,
the
class
had
not
yet
been
certified.
justice
stevens
how
big
is
the
class?
justice
stevens
i
see.
are
they
all
former
employees
of
this
particular...
of
the
respondent--
justice
stevens
--are
the
members
of
the
class
former
employees?
this
is
a
title
viii
case.
justice
stevens
of
the
respondent.
i
see.
justice
stevens
and
has
the
district
court
decided
that
if
relief
is
given
to
the
class
there
will
be
no
relief
given
to
torres?
justice
stevens
that
is
still
a
question
that
is
open.
justice
stevens
he
is
not--
justice
stevens
--but
it
is
conceivable,
is
it
not,
that...
assume
we
agree
with
your
opponent.
your
client
might
still
get
his
share
of
the
recovery.
it
is
still
possible.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
they
are
on
the
firing
line
because
they
risk
liability
for
costs,
is
one
of
the
reasons,
and
i
gather
your
client
didn't
risk
that
liability
on
the
appeal.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
normally
i
thought
named
plaintiff
not
the
same
thing
as
the
members--
justice
stevens
--you
are
arguing
that
an
unnamed
plaintiff
should
get
the
special
consideration
of
the
named
plaintiff,
in
effect,
or
an
unnamed
appellant,
rather.
it
is
rather
anonymous.
justice
stevens
mr.
mckae,
i
remember
in
law
school
from
time
to
time
i
would
see
cases
named
one
of
the
spouses
and
it
would
say
"et
ux".
do
you
suppose
that
would
be
an
adequate
notice
of
appeal,
to
name
a
husband
et
ux?
justice
stevens
i
think
it
means
"and
spouse".
justice
stevens
yes,
but
in
order
to
do
that
they
would
have
had
to
depart
from
the
law
of
the
ninth
circuit
because
there
was
a
precedent
in
your
circuit,
was
there
not?
justice
stevens
i
think
there
was
a--
justice
stevens
--cases--
justice
stevens
--i
thought
there
was
a
case
in
1950
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
was
right
on
the
nose.
maybe
i
am
wrong.
