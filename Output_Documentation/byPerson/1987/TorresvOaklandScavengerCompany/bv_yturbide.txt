mr.
b.v.
yturbide
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
frank
to
say
to
the
court
at
the
outset
that
i
am
here
today
with
mixed
emotions,
thrilled,
of
course,
after
some
35
years
of
practice
to
have
at
least
the
opportunity
to
appear
at
our
judicial
summit,
but
saddened,
too,
at
least
chagrined
by
the
irony
that
this
certainly
for
me
the
most
memorable
appearance
in
my
career
should
be
basically
traceable
to
a
lapse
in
my
office
marking
one
of
the
low
points
of
my
career,
perhaps,
the
very
xx
of
it,
or
close
to
it.
the
court
will
recall
that
contrary
to
intention,
through
inadvertence,
jose
torres,
one
of
16
hispanic
and
black
persons
intervening
as
plaintiffs
in
a
potential
class
action
for
employment
discrimination,
was
not
specifically
named
along
with
the
rest,
and
a
notice
of
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
dismissal
which
erroneously
threw
the
entire
action
out
of
court
and
which
therefore
in
the
ultimate
was
successfully
reversed
on
the
appeal.
the
notice
of
appeal
had
listed
his
15
co-intervenors
and
had
used
the
phrase
mr.
torres,
happily
for
me.
the
omission
was
not,
could
not
be
of
any
importance,
any
harm
to
the
trajectory
of
the
appeal
because
the
erroneous
reasoning
leading
to
this
missile
and
naturally
in
consequence
the
issues
argued
and
resolved
on
the
appeal
were
not
of
individualized
and
varying
concern,
but
were
of
general
and
the
same
concern
alike
to
all
the
named
intervenors
as
a
group,
and
for
that
matter
to
the
absent
and
passive
members
of
the
class
as
well.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
oh,
the
sanctions
were
very
realistically
in
the
picture
before
the
appeal
ever
came
into
it.
the
fact
is
that
as
soon
as
the
erroneous
dismissal
occurred,
respondent
here,
the
defendant
there,
had
moved
for
attorneys'
fees
and
costs
as
well.
so
that
by
not
appealing,
if
that
had
been
the
intention,
why,
he
was
exposing
himself
for
sure
to
the
possibility
of
that
type
of
sanction.
it
was
not
a
theoretical
thing
of
the
future.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
no.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
but
i
think
on
balance
that
that
would
hardly
have
been
a
serious
matter.
the
fact
is
that
he
wanted
to
appeal
in
any
event,
and
would
of
course
have
been
willing
to
expose
himself
to
the
sanctions.
there
is
some
theoretical
discussion
by
my
opponent
to
the
effect
that
actually
he
didn't
want
to
get
into
the
appeal
and
it
was
my
idea
and
i
engineered
it
and
dragged
him
in
by
the
heels,
and
he
would
have
been
fearful
of
the
costs
and
so
forth
he
would
have
incurred.
why,
that
is
contrary
to
the
only
showing
that
was
made
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
it
was
uncontroverted
below,
and
certainly
realistically
he
was
already
exposed
to
that,
and
perhaps
the
greater
danger
on
balance
would
have
been
that
the
erroneous
dismissal
by
becoming
final
would
expose
him
to
that
problem.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
i
believe
that
the
matter
would
be
somewhat
different.
we
have
to
face
realistically
that
the
complaint
is
what
begins
an
entire
aspect
of
litigation,
but
in
point
of
fact,
as
has
been
belatedly
noted
in
this
matter
by
my
opponent
even
in
this
proceeding
for
the
first
time,
i
think
that
the
caption
of
the
complaint
did
not
in
fact
list
mr.
torres's
name,
even
in
the
complaint
in
intervention,
although
the
allegations
in
the
body
did
list
him
among
the
others.
once
you
have
a
complaint
that
starts
the
litigation
then
it
seems
to
me
that
everything
that
happens
after
that
is
in
a
different
category
than
the
complaint
itself.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
well,
of
course,
that's
the
theory,
and
that
is
part
of
the
reason,
i
suppose,
that
we
are
here
all
together
today,
is
to
see
whether
or
not
that
is
or
is
not
a
jurisdictional
act
in
this
kind
of
context
where
at
least
you
have
someone
who
has
instituted
the
notice
of
appeal
with
reference
to
the
subject
matter
that
is
of
common
interest
to
all
of
those
who
were
similarly
situated,
here
identically
situated
below.
that
is
different
than
the
picture
presented
by
the
complaint.
that
is
indeed
the
kind
of
picture
that
this
court's
own
rule
10.4
seems
to
contemplate,
and
that
is
that
once
you
have
a
notice
of
by
someone
before
this
court,
then
this
court's
own
rule,
contrary
to
any
jurisdictional
concept
with
respect
to
unspecified
persons
is
automatically
all
parties
below
are
included
as
parties.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
well,
10.4
is
an
appellate
rule,
your
honor,
as
19.6
is
the
certiorari
one.
yes,
of
course,
we
were
confronting
rule
3(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
but
one
of
the
points,
of
course,
that
jangles
in
what
has
happened
below
is
that
a
jurisdictional
rigid
application
of
the
appellant
specification
requirement
in
rule
3(c)
is
in
clash
with
the
policy
reflected
in
10.4
and
for
that
matter
19.6
of
this
court's
own
rules.
i
think
that
one
of
the
services
that
this
court
can
render
at
this
time
is
to
not
only
comment
upon
that
clash
and
attempt
to
resolve
it
but
perhaps
beyond
this...
opinion
i
make
bold
to
suggest
that
the
time
may
have
come
to
affirmatively
revise
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
to
come
into
conformity
with
the
spirit
reflected
in
10.4
and
19.6.
no
such
provision
now
exists
in
the
what
i
will
call
xx
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
henceforth.
there
doesn't
exist--
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
there
is
no
specific
one.
i
think
what
the
courts
that
have
been
inclined
to
adopt
what
we
regard
as
the
unfortunate
strict
jurisdictional
view
certainly
seem
to
contemplate
even
within
the
confines
of
that
jurisdictional
view
that
amendment
can
occur
at
least
within
the
limited
time
restrictions
provided
for
filing
a
notice
in
the
first
instance,
which
under
rule
4a
presumably
would
be
30
days
plus
conceivably
another
30
days
plus
another
ten
days,
maximum
70
days,
and
that
if
there
is
no
amendment
within
that
time,
then
none
would
be
possible.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
certainly
not.
it
was
not
possible.
we
didn't
know
that
the
thing
was
missing
at
all.
we
are
frank
to
admit
that,
have
always
admitted
it
frankly.
by
the
time
that
attention
was
called
to
it
in
the
appellees'
brief,
respondent
had
briefed
there
in
a
footnote
where
he
recognized
it
was
a
matter
of
oversight,
why,
there
would
have
been
no
opportunity
to
amend,
and
quite
frankly,
i
saw
no
necessity
for
it.
nobody
thought
obviously,
since
he
himself
recognized
it
was
a
matter
of
oversight,
there
was
anything
of
consequence
in
the
matter.
indeed,
there
wasn't
in
view
of
the
commonality
of
issues
and
generalized
nature
of
them.
the
only
recognition
of
oversight
certainly--
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
--in
the
footnote,
why
they
called
attention
to
it?
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
well,
certainly
they
had
some
obligation
if
they
had
an
intention
to
be
open
about
the
matter
and
come
forthrightly
out
with
the
notion
that
in
their
view
there
was
a
violation
of
some
rule
that
he
was
no
longer
a
party
interested
in
the
appeal.
you
know,
the
remarkable
thing
is
that
though
that
is
the
mantle
which
our
opponent
would
like
to
take
up,
even
after
the
adverse
decision
on
that
appeal,
when
the
respondent
came
before
this
court
on
certiorari,
he
noted
the
omission
of
torres's
name
in
effect
by
saying
there
hadn't
been
a
notice
of
appeal
filed
on
him
and
so
forth.
interestingly
enough,
however,
in
his
list
of
interested
parties,
he
included
mr.
torres.
that
is
how
far
he
was
at
the
earlier
time
in
his
inoccuous
footnote
in
the
appellee's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
how
far
he
was
from
forthrightly
claiming
or
even
presaging
a
claim
that
this
man
ought
not
any
longer
to
be
regarded
as
a
person
with
an
ongoing
interest
in
this
field.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
when
was
the
class
certified?
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
i
believe
within
about...
my
recollection
is
correct,
about
four
or
five
months,
in
february
of
1986,
i
think,
something
of
that
kind,
which
was
some
time
four
or
five
months
after
the
entry
of
the
present
summary
judgment
against
mr.
torres.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
that's
correct.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
the
class
is
assumed
to
be,
i
don't
think
that
that
has
been
precisely
established,
but
i
think
it
is
generally
assumed
to
be
as
now
redefined
in
the
liability
opinion
that
the
trial
court
has
come
out
with
and
which
we
have
lodged
now
with
the
court...
it
was
decided
a
couple
of
months
ago
in
favor
of
liability
on
a
broad
front
and
covering
a
15-year
period...
probably
encompasses
something
in
the
hundreds,
300,
400.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
i
am
sorry?
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
yes.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
all
of
them
employees,
all
of
the
named
intervenors,
including
mr.
torres,
certainly
come
within
the
class.
all
of
the
employees
who
have
worked
for
the
company
since
january
10,
1972,
and
who
have
belonged
to
the
defendant
union,
as
well
as
a
group
that
we
call
the
casual
pool,
at
some
point
during
that
period
are
in
the
class
even
as
narrowed
somewhat
in
the
liability
opinion.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
no.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
well,
it
was
decided
that
he
will
not
participate
as
a
named
intervenor.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
he
is
out
as
a
named
intervenor,
has
reserved
decision,
which
in
itself
is
somewhat
menacing,
reserved
decision
as
to
whether
he
may
participate
as
an
absent
class
member.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
only
in
this
sense,
that
it
is
conceivable
that
he
may
after
running
another
gauntlet
get
to
the
point
of
equality
with
absent
class
members.
i
think...
i
suggest
that
the
court
is
probably
aware
that
in
this
field
named
plaintiffs
sometimes
are,
because
they
are
the
sort
of
on
the
firing
line
people,
are
given
some
special
considerations--
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
--well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
real--
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
--i
think
there
is
some...
i
don't
know
what
is
normal
or
what
isn't.
i
know
that
it
is
certainly
not
uncommon,
as
was
said,
well
in
one
case
which
isn't
in
our
briefs,
but
i
happen
to
know,
and
i
think
i
might
even
be
able
to
cite
it.
i
think
it
is
called
the
league
of
martin
against
city
of
milwaukee,
and
it
is
eastern
district,
i
think,
wisconsin,
1984
case,
and
that
is
one,
588
fed
sup.
1004,
1024.
and
that
is
a
case
that
recognizes
that
it
is
not
uncommon
in
consent
decrees
and
settlement
arrangements
to
give
special
recognition
to
the
situation
of
a
named
plaintiff
as
opposed
to
the
regular
class
member.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
i
am
suggesting
that
there
is
an
important
difference
between
whether
you
remain
in
a
case
as
a
named
plaintiff
or
whether
even
if
you
are
so
lucky
as
to
convince
the
judge
that
you
are
entitled
to
that
latter
stage
or
remain
in
the
case
only
in
the
same
level
of
participation
as
an
absent
class
member,
there
is
such
a--
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
--potentially
there
were,
certainly
their
interests
were
represented.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
oh,
i
think
that
there
is
authority
for
the
proposition
that
even
in
the
absence
of
certification
there
is
representative
effect
to
what
potential
representatives
do.
i
think
that
is
the
case
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
the
united
states
against
mcdonald
recognizes
that.
the
romasanta
case
recognizes
that.
if
indeed,
if
there
couldn't
be
representative
effect
for
appellate
purposes,
a
denial
of
class
action
certification
could
not
itself
ever
be
appealed
by
anyone
on
behalf
of
the
class.
so
obviously
there
are
things,
precertification
things
that
would-be
representatives
do,
including
the
maintenance
of
appeals,
from
denial
of
class
action
certification
that
are
representative.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
i
suppose
that
there
are...
that
that
is
another
of
those
areas
where
characterization
can
seemingly
make
a
difference.
i
would
suggest
that
in
substance
there
is
no
difference
in
that
possible
difference
in
phraseology.
the
fact
remains
that
there
is
a
benefit
of
the
appeal
for
the
people
who
are
not
specified
in
the
notice
of
appeal
any
more
than
mr.
torres
was.
these
people
would
get
the
benefit
of
that
appeal
for
certain,
but
mr.
torres
may
not
even
get
let
alone
equal
treatment
with
the
co-intervenors
with
whom
he
wished
to
participate.
i
think
that
the
point
that
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
in
this
area
is,
i
think,
the
pre-eminent,
paramount
in
importance
to
the
wholesomeness
of
the
judicial
system
is
the
power
of
all
courts,
the
preservation,
the
vigilant
preservation
of
the
power
of
all
courts,
the
inherent
power
to
respond
to
the
dictates
of
substantive
justice
in
a
particular
case.
being
inherent
by
definition
that
power
is
not
derived
from
and
ought
not
to
be
irrevocably
absolutely
court-made
rules,
making
any
procedural
requirement
jurisdictional
in
the
sense
of
the
say
all,
end
all
measure
of
whether
the
litigant
is
entitled
to
protection
of
an
appeal
or
any
other
judicial
relief
that
may
be
given
is
tantamount
to
a
freakish
departure
from
settled
doctrine
concerning
inherent
power,
frequent
application
in
a
variety
of
situations,
some
of
which
we
have
mentioned
in
the
briefs,
and
many
of
which
i
am
sure
the
court
is
fully
familiar
with.
there
isn't
any
reason
to
tap
the
notice
of
appeal
into
some
special
pigeonhole
that
immunizes
it
from
the
deep
scrutiny
of
that
inherent
power
to
do
justice.
we
basically
rely
on
that
concept,
and
it
is
implicit
in
the
various
cases
which
have
in
fact,
as
we
have
cited,
relaxed
or
overridden
noncompliance,
excusing
noncompliance
with
appellate
rules,
including
this
court's
decision
in
foman
against
davis,
that
is
reported
in
371
u.s.
beginning
at
178.
that
concept
of
inherent
power
is
also
expressed
sometimes
in
some
of
the
cases
which
have
approached
the
matter
in
the
constructive
fashion
that
we
suggest
to
the
court
is
critical.
such
a
case
is
the
san
diego
commission
against
governing
board,
790
fed
2d.
1471.
it
is
an
utterance
which
i
would
commend
as
worthy
for
allegiance
of
this
court
in
this
particular
case.
it
was
said,
"we
have
discretion
where
the
interests
of
substantive
justice
require
it
to
disregard
irregularities
in
the
form
or
procedure
for
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal.
"
that
is
a
commendable
utterance,
one
that
is
in
conformity
with
inherent
power
and
to
do
justice
and
certainly
that
is
something
which
we
have
occasion
in
this
court
to
give
impetus
to
again
and
i
think
should
be
in
the
context
which
is
in
such...
in
which
seeming
disarray
and
the
split
among
the
circuits
as
to
whether
there
is
jurisdictional
effect
to
rule
3(c)
or
not.
i
think
when
all
is
said
and
done
what
it
comes
down
to
is,
boils
down
to
is,
what
was
said
in
the
foman
case
a
quarter
century
ago,
namely,
that
it
is
too
late
in
the
day
and

the
notice

appeal

complaint,
that
pleading

a

skill

one
misstep
by
counsel
may
be
decisive
to
the
outcome

accept
the
principle
that
the

pleading

to
facilitate

put
it
simply
and
perhaps
just

eloquently
when
he
said
"the

"
that
certainly
is
mr.
torres.
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
yes,
sir.
i
want
to
straighten
out
one
thing
about
this
motion
that
no
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
on
behalf
of
mr.
torres.
that
is
the
language
which
in
a
calmer
day
in
retrospect
our
opponents
have
really
emphasized,
and
of
course
that
begs
the
question
in
part
with
reference
to
the
representative
effect
of
the
notice
that
was
filed.
certain
it
is
that
the
words
mr.
mckae
likes
it
or
not,
have
been
held
without
more
to
substantially
comply
with
the
rule
and
constitute
a
notice
of
appeal
on
behalf
of
an
unspecified
party.
we
have
cited
the
ayres
case
in
our
brief.
we
have
cited
the
parrish
case
in
our
brief.
they
squarely
hold
that
way.
now
it
is
true
that
the
van
hoose
case
holds
the
other
way.
well,
that
is
just
a
conflict,
and
the
fact
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
come
out
with
one
view
which
mr.
mckae
would
like
to
embrace
does
not
resolve
the
conflict
and
necessarily
point
the
way
in
which
it
ought
to
be
resolved.
now,
we
have
heard
again
and
we
have
heard
throughout
respondent's
brief
in
this
case
something
which
i
must
comment
on
because
it
is
of
a
factual
nature
and
amounts
to
what
in
legislative
halls
i
suppose
would
be
called
a
point
of
personal
privilege.
it
is
a
red
herring
type
of
argument
that
has
been
thrown
into
this
picture
recklessly
and
callously,
inspired
apparently
by
the
notion
so
often
discredited
even
on
the
football
field
that
the
best
defense
is
a
good
offense.
it
is
suggested
that
rather
than
wasting
all
our
time
here
for
a
good
period
of
our
lives
on
these
kind
of
proceedings,
what
mr.
torres
ought
to
have
been
doing
is
sue
me
in
a
california
court
for
malpractice,
deliberate
misdeeds
and
folly,
and
not
seeking
to
cure
an
amendment
when
the
omission
was...
by
amendment
when
the
omission
was
called
to
our
attention
and
assertedly
the
position
was
clearly
made
that
this
man
had
no
ongoing
interest
further
in
this
case
and
ought
not
to
be
treated
in
the
same
boat
as
the
other
named
plaintiffs.
now,
i
defy
anyone
to
read
that
footnote
that
is
in
question
and
come
to
the
view
that
it
represents
a
clear
position
to
that
effect,
and
as
i
suggested
in
my
opening
remarks,
the
fact
is
that
even
afterward
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
before
this
court
the
opponents
themselves
listed
mr.
torres
as
a
person
interested
in
the
outcome
of
the
case.
now,
the
fact
is
that
you
don't
have
to
make
an
amendment
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
kind
of
cases
that
favor
our
position
in
this
matter
against
the
jurisdictional
view.
you
don't
have
to
add
a
name
anywhere.
you
merely
have
to
hold
that
the
matter
was
harmless,
the
omission
was
harmless,
there
has
been
no
prejudice,
and
therefore
you
should
treat
him
as
an
ongoing
plaintiff.
such
was
the
fact
in
the
ayres
case.
there
was
no
amendment
to
add
his
name
anywhere.
nor
in
the
parrish
case.
nor
in
the
williams
against
frey
case,
for
instance,
all
of
which
we
have
cited
in
our...
there
is
no
question
about
an
amendment,
and
we
are
continually
charged
with
having
failed
or
having
attacked
an
order
here
of
the
court,
an
interim
order
where
they
denied
a
motion
to
recall
and
to
amend
and
so
forth.
we
are
not
attacking
that
order
except
as
a
possible
alternative,
raise
the
possibility
that
this
court
might
think
that
that
is
a
preferable
procedure
even
if
it
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
at
this
time.
we
merely
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
ought
not
to
have
affirmed
the
summary
judgment,
ought
to
have
reversed
the
summary
judgment,
because--
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
--there
was
some
law
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
touched
that
specific--
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
--matter
completely
at
odds,
completely
at
odds,
your
honor,
with--
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
--other
cases
in
the
ninth
circuit
if
i
may
say
so,
which
do
relax
appellate
rules
without
making
them
jurisdictional,
including,
i
might
say--
mr.
b.v.
yturbide
--yes,
i
have
no
doubt
that
cook
against...
cook
and
sons
is
a
case
pointing
in
that
direction
as
well,
and
others.
