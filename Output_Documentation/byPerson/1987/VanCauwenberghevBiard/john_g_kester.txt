mr.
john
g.
kester
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
questions
of
appealability
of
collateral
final
decisions
to
the
courts
of
appeals
under
28
usc
1291
which
is
the
basic
statute
that
provides
for
appeal
from
the
district
courts
by
right.
the
suit
is
a
civil
action
between
two
belgians.
it
was
filed
by
the
respondent;
a
brussels
stockbroker
for
20
years
against
the
petitioner,
who
was
a
brussels
real
estate
broker
for
30
years.
it
was
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
and
los
angeles.
the
petitioner
was
arrested
in
switzerland
at
the
request
of
the
united
states
government
while
he
was
on
a
business
trip
to
geneva.
he
was
then
extradited
to
the
united
states
pursuant
to
the
extradition
treaty
of
1900
between
this
country
and
switzerland.
the
charges
against
him
were
mail
fraud
and
causing
interstate
transportation
of
a
victim
of
fraud.
and
he
was
tried
and
convicted
in
the
central
district
of
california
on
those
charges,
one
count
of
each.
the
issue
in
the
criminal
case
centered
around
what
he
knew,
what
his
state
of
mind
was
during
conversations
that
he
had
with
respondent,
most
of
which
took
place
in
belgium
or
switzerland
and
that
extended
over
a
period
of
about
three
years.
and
that
also
included,
as
a
jurisdictional
basis
for
the
criminal
case,
a
three-day
visit
to
los
angeles
during
which
the
respondent
gave
him
a
check
for
a
loan
to
a
real
estate
partnership.
after
the
conviction,
petitioner
was
placed
on
probation.
as
a
part
of
a
sentence
of
the
criminal
court,
the
court
ordered
him
to
stay
in
the
united
states
for
the
next
five
years
or
until
he
made
satisfactory
provision
for
payment
of
$34,000
as
restitution
of
what
the
court
held
he
owed
to
the
respondent,
plus
some
additional
money
to
another
belgian.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
probation
order
was
modified
subsequently.
what
happened
was
the
judge
said
at
first
that
he
had
to
stay
in
california.
it
was
then
modified
and
said
he
could
stay
anyplace
in
the
united
states.
the
petitioner
asked
the
judge
later
to
modify
the
conditions
of
probation
and
the
judge
said
that
if
an
adequate
arrangement
could
be
made
to
provide
security
for
the
payment
of
all
the
amounts
in
the
criminal
case,
not
the
civil
case,
the
judge
would...
and
if
the
government
agreed
that
it
was
satisfactory,
that
he
could
return
to
belgium.
and,
earlier
this
year,
this
is
spelled
out
in
the
papers
filed
in
this
court
in
the
criminal
case,
he
entered
such
a
contract,
and
the
government
agreed
he
could
return
to
belgium.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes.
mr.
john
g.
kester
on
the
first
day
that
the
petitioner
went,
at
that
time,
he
was
required
to
be
in
california,
as
ordered
by
the
court
to
report
to
his
probation
officer
in
los
angeles,
as
soon
as
he
arrived
at
the
probation
office,
he
was
handed
the
summons
and
complaint
in
this
case.
it
demanded
millions
of
dollars
in
travel
and
punitive
damages
for
alleged
violation
of
the
u.s.
civil
ricoh
statute
and
for
various
california
laws.
the
respondent
later
explained
that
he
waited
until
after
the
trial
to
serve
petitioner
and
to
quote
respondent:
"because
of
case
authority
questioning
the
validity
of
serving
a
defendant
during
a
compelled
appearance
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
"
the
respondent
claimed
that
handing
the
summons
in
california
in
the
probation
office
was
what
created
jurisdiction
for
the
civil
case
based
on
personal
service
of
process
within
that
state.
the
petitioner
was
allowed
to
appear
specially
in
the
district
court.
he
moved
to
dismiss
on
several
jurisdictional
grounds,
two
of
which
were
the
subject
of
the
appeal.
the
first
ground
was
that
he
could
not
be
called
to
answer
in
a
civil
suit
that
was
based
on
personal
service
made
on
him
while
he
was
compelled
to
be
in
this
country
because
of
extradition.
and
he
relied
on
u.s.
extradition
statutes,
the
extradition
treaty
with
switzerland
and
this
court's
decision
in
1886
in
the
united
states
v.
rauscher.
rauscher
held
that
an
extradited
person
while
here
in
the
united
states
is
immune
from
being
required
to
defend
in
a
criminal
court
except
against
the
criminal
charges
for
which
he
was
extradited.
rauscher
didn't
involve
appealability;
did
it?
mr.
john
g.
kester
rauscher
did
not
involve
appealability.
it
actually
came
up
prior
to
final
judgment
on
a
certificate
of
division
between
the
two
judges
who
were
sitting
in
the
circuit
court.
in
fact,
i
don't
believe
at
that
time
the
criminal
cases
were
appealable
to
the
federal
courts,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
g.
kester
that
is
right.
it
was
a
criminal
case.
and
then
after
rauscher,
within
three
or
four
years,
the
question
came
up
in
the
lower
courts
of:
what
do
you
do
with
the
rauscher
principle
when
there
is
a
civil
case
and
it
was
immediately
held
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
what
became
the
leading
case
on
the
subject,
in
re
reinitz,
that
the
principle
of
rauscher
necessarily
applied
equally
to
a
criminal
prosecution
or
a
civil
case.
and
that
has
been
the
law
up
to
this
point.
there
is
nothing
ever
until
this
case
that
held
otherwise.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that's
right.
immunity
from
service
of
process.
immunity
from
having
to
defend
a
civil
case.
and
just
to
complete
the
status
of
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court,
the
other
motion
that
was
denied
and
that
petitioner
appealed
from
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
forum
non
conveniens.
and
in
support
of
that,
he
submitted
affidavits
showing
that
the
courts
in
brussels
were
open
as
indeed
the
respondent
conceded
that
most
of
the
witnesses
were
europeans,
most
of
the
documents
were
in
foreign
language,
that
belgian
business
customs
were
involved
and
it
didn't
belong
in
a
u.s.
court
and
that
he
was...
that
the
petitioner
was
able
at
all
times
to
have
been
sued
in
belgium
if
the
respondent
had
wanted
to
sue
him
there.
basically,
the
argument
was
that
los
angeles
was
not
a
convenient
forum
for
a
civil
case
for
anybody
except
for
the
respondent
to
try
to
come
under
the
u.s.
treble
damage
and
punitive
damage
provisions
of
the
peculiar
u.s.
civil
ricoh
law.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
without
any
argument
and
without
any
opinion.
the
petitioner
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
consider
his
claim
of
immunity
or
his
claim
of
forum
non
conveniens,
and
instead
it
dismissed
the
case
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
a
district
court
order
that
denies
an
extradited
person's
claim
of
immunity
from
civil
process
and
denies
a
documented
and
uncontroverted
showing
of
forum
non
conveniens
is
an
appealable
collateral
final
decision
under
the
doctrine
of
cohen
v.
beneficial
loan,
coopers
&
lybrand
v.
livesay,
and
mitchell
v.
forsyth.
with
your
permission,
i
will
address
the
first
part
of
my
argument
to
the
immunity
claim
and
the
second
part
to
forum
non
conveniens.
the
forum
non
conveniens
case,
we
will
submit,
comes
within
the
familiar
three
tests
of
coopers
&
lybrand,
cohen
and
reiterated
in
many
others.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
kester
absolutely.
what
we
are
talking
about,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
a
very
limited
narrowly
statutorily
and
treaty
based
kind
of
immunity
that
applies
to
a
person
who
is
brought
into
this
country
through
the
engines
of
the
extradition
process.
and
that
holds
that
when
a
person
comes
into
the
jurisdiction
for
that
purpose,
his
presence
here
cannot
be
used
to
serve
him
and
cause
him
to
come
into
court.
mr.
john
g.
kester
it
runs,
according
to
the
treaty
with
switzerland,
it
runs
basically
for
a
month.
there
are
cases
that
have
had
less
explicit
treaties.
he
just
can't
hang
around
forever.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that
is
correct.
this
immunity
is
not
something
that
would
last
all
his
life,
although,
as
a
practical
matter,
perhaps
it
could.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
would
not
have
advised
him
to
come
back.
mr.
john
g.
kester
no,
justice
kennedy,
this
is
not--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--well,
i
don't
think
my
answer
surprised
you,
but
this
is
not
the
same
thing
as
the
ordinary
14th
amendment
due
process
immunity
from
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
g.
kester
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
because
i
think
really
what
you
have
in
this
case
when
we
are
talking
about
the
immunity
is
a
cohen
v.
beneficial
loan
but
it
is
really
a
cohen-plus
situation.
you
meet
not
only
the
three
tests
of
the
cohen
case
and
coopers
&
lybrand
v.
livesay,
but
there
is
something
more.
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
what
i
am
not
arguing.
i
am
not
arguing
this
afternoon
to
try
to
persuade
you
that
there
ought
to
be
an
immediate
appeal
for
every
defendant
who
would
like
to
win
his
case
on
a
pre-trial
motion.
because,
obviously,
if
that
became
the
law,
there
would
be
nothing
left
of
1291
and
you
would
have
piecemeal
appeals
all
over.
and
that
is
true
in
the
case
of
a
12(b)(2)
ordinary
personal
jurisdiction
situation.
but
ordinary
personal
jurisdiction
as
this
court
said
in
the
burger
king
case
is
not
an
exemption
from
having
to
stand
trial.
it
is
a
right
not
to
have
an
enforceable
binding
judgment
brought
against
you
in
a
forum
with
which
one
did
not
have
adequate
contacts.
and
it
also,
as
a
practice
matter,
it
extends
so
broadly
on
across
the
board
that
it
would
be
a
tremendous
inroad
on
the
limitations
on
appeal--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--this
is
different,
justice
scalia,
i
think
first
of
all
because
it
has
always
been
recognized
as
different.
it
is
described
in
the
rauscher
case
where
the
immunity
was
first
recognized.
it
is
described
in
terms
of
not...
the
court
not
having
jurisdiction
to
bring
him
to
trial.
so,
the
court
in
rauscher
says
that
in
this
question
that
was
certified
to
it
and
afterwards,
but
more
importantly--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--no,
because
in
rauscher,
the
court
was
not
talking
about
the
14th
amendment
or
due
process
or
anything
like
that.
the
court
was
talking
about
the
extradition
statutes
of
the
united
states
and
the
treaty
under
which
the
person
was
extradited.
what
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
what
you
can
see
in
the
cases
is
that
the
principle
that
allows
an
appeal
in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
challenge
to
bringing
person
to
trial,
is
that
you
look
at
the
source
of
the
right.
you
have
to
analyze
what
the
right
is
that
is
being
protected.
here
you
have
a
right
protected
by
a
specific
federal
statute.
there
is
a
federal
policy
that
says
you
cannot
do
this.
it
is
enacted
into
law.
that
was
what
this
court
decided
in
rauscher
and
in
the
civil
context
in
reinitz,
and
i
submit
correctly
in
reinitz.
what
you
have
is
something
very
much
like
the
mercantile
bank
case
which
was
decided
under
1257
which
we
cite
in
our
briefs.
that
was
an
appeal
from
a
state
court
and
a
tougher
row
to
hoe
in
that
respect.
but,
analytically,
this
case
is
like
mercantile
bank
v.
langdeau.
mr.
john
g.
kester
no.
i
don't
think
they
are
nuances,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
all
respect.
i
think
what
you
have
is
a
federal
statute.
the
basis
for
rauscher
was
a
federal
statute
that--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--that
is
right.
that
is
right.
you
shall
not
bring
this
guy
to
trial.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
difference,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
principle
here
is
the
same
principle
you
had
in
mitchell
v.
forsyth.
mr.
john
g.
kester
because
in
the
personal
jurisdiction
principle,
you
are
talking
about
very
broad
general
provisions
under
the
14th
amendment
having
to
do
with
personal
contact.
and
the
right
is
the
right
that
was
talked
about
in
the
burger
king
case.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
basis,
as
you
are
suggesting,
the
basis
on
which
it
is
claimed
and
say:
would
bringing
the
person
to
trial
seriously
subvert
the
policy
of
the
very
protection
which
he
is
invoking.
and
if
you
conclude
that
the
only
way
to
vindicate
the
policy
of
the
legal
provision,
the
statute
or
treaty
on
which
he
is
relying
is
to
provide
an
appeal
at
that
point--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--it
is
not
that
strong
a
policy,
i
would
have
to
say.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
don't
know.
all
i
can
say
on
that
is
to
cite
the
rauscher
case,
the
reinitz
case
and
the
specific
provisions.
the
difference,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
you
are
not
dealing
here
with
just
general
provisions
that
apply
to
everybody.
this
is
a
statute
that
is
set
up
for
particular--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--we
are
only
talking
about
people
who
are
present
in
this
country
as
a
result
of
extradition.
it
is
a
narrowly
defined
class
of
people.
as
justice
brennan's
dissent
in
mitchell
says,
"a
self-limiting
class".
limited
by
the
statute.
and
if
there
is
not
a
right
to
protect
from
being
called
into
a
foreign
court
when
you
are
brought
here
by
the
purposes
of
extradition,
the
whole
extradition
process
is
subverted.
that
is
basically
what
this
court
said
in
rauscher.
mr.
john
g.
kester
no.
no,
i
don't.
and
that
is
clear.
if
he
committed
a
crime
while
he
was
here--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--a
tort
or
a
crime,
either
one,
clearly
he
would
not
be
immune
because
there
it
is
a
subsequent
situation.
it
is
not
a
subversion
of
the
extradition
process,
itself.
people
cannot
be
extradited,
come
to
this
country,
and
say,
"well,
now,
i
have
a
free
pass
to
go
and
commit
torts.
"
no,
we
are
not
talking
about
that
kind
of
thing
at
all.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
immunity
would
end
after
he
was
released
and
had
a
reasonable
time,
let's
say
a
month,
to
return
home.
mr.
john
g.
kester
after
he
was
released.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes.
mr.
john
g.
kester
it
would
not
end
as
long
as
he
was
subject
to
the
criminal
process
for
which
the
extradition
had
brought
him
to
this
country.
no,
it
would
not
end
until
he
had
been
released
and
had
a
reasonable
time
to
return
home.
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
that
is
how
the
statute
has
been
interpreted
and
the
treaty.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
think
that
if
he
would
be
otherwise
subject
to
civil
process,
it
would
be
good.
the
right
protected
here
is
the
right
not
to
have
your
presence
in
this
country
taken
advantage
of
for
purposes
of
civil
process.
and
if
there
is
some
other
way,
his
house
is
here
or
something,
i
think
that
that
would
not
come
within
it.
you
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
protection.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
would
say
it
could
be.
i
mean
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
this
sort
of
thing--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
think
the
issue,
justice
stevens,
is
almost
always
going
to
arise
in
a
very
pristine
posture.
i
mean
it
has
taken
100
years
for
it
to
arise
here.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
can
explain
it
this
way.
first
of
all,
people
who
have
asserted
this
privilege
have
always
won
in
the
district
court.
mr.
john
g.
kester
it
has
always
been
the
other
person
who
is
appealing,
if
any.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
other
is
that
many
of
the
earlier
cases
came
up
on
habeas
corpus
because
in
those
days
the
creditor's
rights
were
much
fiercer
than
they
are
today
and
they
commonly
commenced
civil
law
suits
with
what
the
called
the
capias
and
they
would
put
a
capias
ad
respondendum
in.
that
put
the
man
in
jail
and
he
had
to
give
to
security
before
he
could
get
out
of
jail.
that
is
how
a
lot
of
these
civil
suits
started.
he
had
a
remedy
there
in
habeas
corpus.
and,
in
fact,
if
you
look
towards
the
end
of
the
rauscher
opinion
and
also
at
the
end
of
the
reinitz
opinion,
the
courts
there
say,
"we
invite
people
to
bring
habeas
corpus
actions
in
these
situations
to
the
federal
courts,
even
though
the
state
proceedings
are
not
yet
completed,
because
this
ought
to
be
resolved
right
away.
"
at
the
end
of
reinitz,
the
district
judge
says
that.
and
rauscher,
even
this
court
said
that.
it
was
a
clear
understanding
that
this
ought
to
be
resolved
without
a
lot
of
proceedings
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
john
g.
kester
there
was
a
purported
attachment
of
his
property.
there
was
never
a
claim
made
that
that
created
any
jurisdiction.
it
was
never
used
for
a
jurisdictional
purpose.
and
what
happened
was
at
the
time
that
order
was
obtained,
his
property
had
already
been...
which
had
been
extradited
from
switzerland
with
him,
had
already
gone
back
out
of
the
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
criminal
court.
so,
there
was
nothing
there
to
attach.
in
fact,
the
order,
by
its
very
terms
says,
"this
is
an
attachment
of
property
which
will
be
in
the
jurisdiction.
"
i
know
that
cannot
create
quasi-jurisdiction,
if
anything
can
anymore.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes.
mr.
john
g.
kester
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
what
i
would
say
about
forum
non
conveniens
is
this:
obviously,
i
recognize
that
the
forum
non
conveniens
issue
is
a
closer
issue,
in
my
view,
it
is
a
closer
issue
than
the
immunity
issue.
you
don't
have
the
statutory
provisions
in
support.
you
don't
have
the
background
of
100
years
supporting
it.
and
there
has
been
disagreement
among
respected
judges
on
both
sides
on
the
forum
non
conveniens
point.
we
would
submit
on
that
that
the
three
provisions
required
in
coopers
&
lybrand
and
cohen
are
met
in
the
forum
non
conveniens
situation
for
the
reasonably
stated
by
judge
wilke
in
his
d.c.
circuit
opinion
on
that.
mr.
john
g.
kester
is
this
an
important
issue?
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
think
in
the
real
world,
it
does
do
injustice.
this
man
couldn't
afford
to
defend
a
civil
case
in
los
angeles,
california.
there
was
no
way
that
he
could
do
that
even
if
he
had
wanted
to.
and
this
happens
all
too
frequently
in
forum
non
conveniens
situations.
it
is
an
important
right.
this
court
in
piper
v.
reyno
talked
about
the
importance
of
the
forum
non
conveniens
situation,
the
right
there.
it
is
not
a
statutorily
embodied
right
of
the
kind
that
you
have
in
the
immunity
situation
or
embodied
in
a
treaty,
but
it
is
a
very
important
right.
it
is
certainly
important
enough
to
litigants
to
the
point
that
as
the
word
"important"
has
been
used
in
cohen
cases,
it
is
dispositive
of
whether
the
trial
is
going
to
take
place
in
this
country.
and
i
think
that
is
important
for
purposes
of
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
forum
non
conveniens,
i
would
submit,
is
something
more
than
simply
venue.
and
i
am
not
urging
that
venue
motions
should
be
appealable
if
they
are
denied.
forum
non
conveniens
cases
really
don't
come
up
all
that
often.
there
probably
are...
i
checked.
last
year
they
were
on
about
a
dozen
forum
non
conveniens
cases
where
it
had
been
granted
and
gone
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
we
can
assume
that
there
would
be
more.
but
there
certainly
wouldn't
be
any
great
opening
of
flood
gates
in
this
situation,
but
the
rights
in
a
forum
non
conveniens
case
are
different
than
mere
venue
rights.
it
boils
down
really
as
a
practical
matter
as
to
whether
there
is
going
to
be
any
effective
appellate
review
when
district
courts
allow
cases
to
remain
on
their
documents
that
simply
shouldn't
be
in
this
country.
the
venue
statutes
don't
really
necessarily
provide
that
kind
of
adequate
protection.
venue
is
very
easy
to
come
by
in
this
country.
forum
non
conveniens
looks
at
something
deeper
and
more
involving
issues
of
justice
than
venue
does.
and
venue
really
is
not
what
is
at
stake
here.
as
a
technical
matter,
i
think
that
the
forum
non
conveniens
issue
really
focuses
around
the
second
of
the
coopers
&
lybrand
and
cohen
tests.
the
question
whether
it
is
enmeshed
in
the
merits
and
therefore
should
not
be
viewed
as
a
final
collateral
decision.
judge
wilke
talked
about
that.
the
cases,
even
from
some
of
the
circuits
which
have
feeling
under
the
compulsion
of
coopers
held
that
these
orders
are
not
appealable,
the
cases
have
made
clear
in
the
second
circuit
and
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
a
forum
non
conveniens
determination
does
not
require
or
involve
getting
deeply
into
the
issues
of
the
case
at
all.
you
simply
have
a
few
affidavits.
the
affidavits
will
plainly
or
not
plainly
show
whether
this
is
a
convenient
forum
in
which
to
hold
the
proceedings.
the
issue
is
collateral.
it
doesn't
bog
the
reviewing
court
down.
and,
indeed,
the
fifth
circuit,
which
has
held
that
under
the
compulsion
of
its
reading
of
this
court's
cases,
it
cannot
hear
forum
non
conveniens
cases.
the
fifth
circuit
has
practically
begged
the
district
judges
in
that
circuit
to
certify
such
issues
to
the
court
of
appeals
so
that
they
can
be
decided
without
having
the
waste
of
going
through
an
unnecessary
trial.
there
is
only
one
reported
case
in
which
a
forum
non
conveniens
denial
has
ever
lead
to
a
reversal
after
trial.
so,
the
only
time
that
you
can,
as
a
practical
matter,
enforce
this
protection,
and
keep
cases
out
of
the
u.s.
courts
that
do
not
belong
there,
is
to
do
so...
is
to
do
so
before
trial
or
never.
it
is
a
pre-trial
motion.
it
is
always
decided
pre-trial.
and
that
is
when
it
should
be
decided.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
macdonald
case
is
not
the
closest
case
to
this.
that
case
involved
issues
of
prejudice
and
speedy
trial.
we
are
talking
in
the
immunity
here
of
a
clean
clear
bright
line
immunity
which
depends
on
nothing
outside
the
question
of
whether
the
man
was
extradited
to
this
country
or
not.
mr.
john
g.
kester
but
as
this
court
pointed
out,
speedy
trial
depends
on
prejudice.
there
is
no
issue
of
prejudice
here.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
underlying
merits
of
the
suit.
the
suit
could
be
about
anything
and
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
it
was
said
by
my
friend
that
in
the
case
of
diplomatic
immunity
he
recognizes
that
under
cohen
there
would
be
an
appeal.
mr.
john
g.
kester
he
is
certainly
subject
to
service
of
process
if
he
comes
here
voluntarily.
any
person
who
wanders
into
california
and
has
a
summons
handed
to
him--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
think
it
is
very
much
like
the
immunity
in
abney
and
nixon
in
this
respect,
justice
white.
you
have
to
look
at
what
is
the
protection
that
is
conferred.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
really
is
what
this
is
about
because
we
know
that
isn't
going
to
happen.
there
was
a
suggestion
he
could
be
served
under
a
long
arm
statute.
the
fact
is
he
couldn't
be
served
under
a
long
arm
statute
while
he
was
in
the
united
states
because--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--this
is
a
case
of
whether
this
person
really
can
be
subjected
to
suit
in
the
united
states
because
the
defective
service...
the
service
was
defective
because
a
federal
statute
and
a
federal
treaty
were
violated
in
invoking
that
service
on
him.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that
is
just
the
ordinary
14th
amendment
objection.
but
that
has
to
do
simply--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--they
are
less
specific,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
is--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--that
is
the
ordinary
personal
jurisdiction.
that
is
not
what
i
am
talking
about.
mr.
john
g.
kester
ordinarily,
they
are
not,
but
in
this
case
we
submit
they
are
because
there
are
considerations
of
international
law
and
international
policy.
