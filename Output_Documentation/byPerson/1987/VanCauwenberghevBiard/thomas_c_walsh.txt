mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
indicted,
tried,
convicted
and
sentenced
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
for,
among
other
things,
transporting
the
respondent
to
los
angeles
for
the
purpose
of
defrauding
him
out
of
a
million
dollars.
he
was
also
convicted
of
the
substantive
offense
of
wire
fraud.
that
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
certiorari
has
been
denied
by
this
court.
this
case
that
is
presently
before
you
is
the
civil
aftermath
of
that
criminal
matter.
the
legal
questions
presented,
although
as
has
been
mentioned,
they
have
a
few
nuances
to
them.
basically,
what
they
asked
this
court
to
hold
is
that
motions
based
on
lack
of
jurisdiction,
motions
challenging
venue,
when
they
are
denied,
they
are
immediately
appealed
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
now,
he
says
he
does
not
want
a
ruling
that
broad,
but
that
is
the
practical
effect
of
what
he
is
asking
you
to
do
here.
and
i
suggest
that
that
type
of
a
ruling,
if
it
comes
from
this
court,
has
substantial
implications
for
our
justice
system.
it
will
further
open
the
doors
to
interlocutory
appeals
and
will
overburden
the
already
overtaxed
appellate
courts.
now,
this
is
really
a
frontal
assault
on
the
final
judgment
rule,
in
my
view,
section
1291
of
title
28,
which
is
in
reality
the
cornerstone
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
the
final
judgment
rule
goes
back
to
the
first
judiciary
act
and
has
a
number
of
salutary
purposes.
one
of
which
is
that
it
of
course
prevents
repetitive
piecemeal
appeals
of
what
is
in
essence
a
single
lawsuit.
it
allows
review
after
the
case
so
that
claims
of
error
can
be
put
in
their
proper
perspective
to
determine
not
only
if
they
were
in
fact
erroneous,
but
if
they
were
prejudicially
so.
it
recognizes
the
critical
role
of
the
trial
judge
in
our
system,
as
justice
marshall
mentioned
in
the
firestone
case.
it
prevents
the
appellate
court
from
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
every
turn.
it
makes
the
appellate
court
appropriately
a
reviewing
court
and
not
an
intervening
court.
and,
finally
and
practically,
it
avoids
appeals
in
a
large
number
of
cases
which
are
either
settled
or
eventually
won
by
the
party
who
was
originally
aggrieved.
and
since
80
to
90
percent
of
our
cases
are
eventually
settled,
it
is
obvious
how
the
final
judgment
rule
helps
to
relieve
the
burden
on
the
appellate
courts.
of
course,
there
are
exceptions
to
the
final
judgment
rule
some
of
which
come
from
congress,
such
as
section
1292(b),
the
interlocutory
appeals
act,
section
1651
which
is
the
extraordinary
writs
act
providing
for
mandamus,
section
1292(a)(1),
injunction
cases,
and
this
court's
rule
54(b).
but,
generally,
the
price
we
pay
for
the
administration
of
justice
in
our
federal
system
in
this
country
is
that
we
await
the
final
judgment
before
we
take
our
complaints
about
the
way
the
proceedings
were
conducted
to
the
appellate
court.
now,
in
1949,
in
the
cohen
case,
of
course,
this
court
carved
out
what
it
called
a
narrow
exception
to
the
finality
requirement
to
be
applied
in
a
small
class
of
cases.
and
that
is
the
cohen
v.
industrial
beneficial
case.
and
there
were
three
requirements
set
out
by
the
court
in
cohen
and
reiterated
by
justice
stevens
in
his
opinion
in
coopers
&
lybrand
just
10
years
ago.
the
first,
in
order
for
an
interlocutory
order
to
be
appealable
as
a
collateral
order,
it
must
first
conclusively
determine
the
issue.
secondly,
it
must
involve
an
important
issue
that
is
completely
separate
from
the
merits;
and,
thirdly,
the
order
must
be
effectively
unreviewable
after
final
judgment.
now,
in
the
last
decade
or
so
since
coopers
&
lybrand
this
court
has
grappled
with
the
collateral
order
doctrine
on
a
number
of
occasions
and
has
consistently
said
that
it
should
be
applied
with
the
utmost
strictness
and
the
exception
should
be
narrowly
construed.
and,
thus,
cases
such
as
coopers
&
lybrand
and
firestone,
united
states
v.
macdonald,
and
flanagan,
and
richardson-merrell,
in
addition
to
justice
powell's
opinion
in
stringfellow
and
the
opinion
in
hollywood
motor
car
company
of
all
refuse
to
expand
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
and
when
read
against
the
context
of
abney,
which
involved
double
jeopardy,
and
mitchell
and
nixon,
which
involved
immunity,
the
rule
that
comes
out
of
this
whole
series
of
cases
is
that
as
far
as
item
3
of
the
cohen
formulation
is
concerned,
namely,
effective
unreviewability,
what
that
really
means
is
that
what
is
at
stake
in
order
to
justify
a
collateral
order
appeal
must
be
indeed
the
right
not
to
be
tried.
any
other
right,
the
court
has
held,
can
be
vindicated
after
final
judgment.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
forum
non
conveniens
motion
here
against
that
background.
forum
non
conveniens
as
has
been
mentioned
is
a
venue-based
objection.
we
believe
that
it
fails
the
collateral
order
doctrine
because
it
does
not
pass
either
the
second
or
the
third
test
of
the
cohen
or
coopers
&
lybrand
criteria.
in
gulf
oil
v.
gilbert
and
piper
v.
reyno,
this
court
set
up
the
elements
of
a
forum
non
conveniens
termination,
particularly
as
regards
the
private
factors
to
be
considered.
the
court
in
weighing
the
forum
non
conveniens
motion
must
look
at
the
access
to
sources
of
proof
and
the
availability
of
witnesses
and
must
also
make
some
practical
determinations
about
the
problems
associated
with
the
case
that
might
make
the
trial
easy,
convenient,
and
expeditious.
now,
in
a
forum
non
conveniens
setting,
we
suggest
that
this
kind
of
analysis,
necessarily,
requires
the
court
to
delve
into
the
merits
of
the
case.
and,
therefore,
we
believe
that
the
issue
of
forum
non
conveniens
is
not
completely
separate
from
the
merits
within
the
meaning
of
the
cohen
doctrine.
it
is
in
effect
a
discretionary
ruling
by
the
trial
court
based
on
speculation
at
the
outset
of
a
case
as
to
whether
the
forum
will
indeed
be
inconvenient
and
if
inconvenient,
whether
it
will
be
prejudicially
so.
and
i
guess
it
is
not
surprising
that
six
of
the
seven
circuits
that
have
ruled
on
the
precise
issue
that
is
before
you
today
have
held
that
forum
non
conveniens
does
not
meet
the
collateral
order
requirements
because
it
is,
among
other
things,
not
completely
separate
from
the
merits.
now,
counsel
has
referred
to
the
fact
that
there
is
split
in
the
circuits.
the
only
circuit
that
has
gone
the
other
way
is
the
fourth
circuit
and
it
did
so
without
any
elaboration
of
its
reasoning,
whatsoever,
in
a
footnote
to
an
opinion
after
it
had
decided
the
merits.
and
all
the
court
said
was,
"we
find
that
the
cohen
criteria
have
been
met.
"
the
other
circuits
have
engaged
in
a
fairly
elaborate
analysis
of
the
issue
and
have
determined
not
only,
for
the
most
part,
that
forum
non
conveniens
does
not
meet
the
second
criterion
of
coopers
and
cohen,
but
that
it
does
not
meet
the
third,
either.
now,
as
regards
the
third
cohen
element
and
forum
non
conveniens,
there
really
isn't
any
reason
why
this
issue
is
not
reviewable
at
the
end
of
the
case
like
any
other
venue
motion.
from
his
brief
and
from
his
argument
here
today,
i
gather
that
counsel's
strongest
point
on
that
issue
is
that
it
doesn't
very
often
result
in
reversal
after
final
judgment.
well,
this
court
has
been
approached
with
that
argument
before
in
stringfellow
and
firestone
and
richardson-merrell,
and
has
said,
"that
may
well
be,
but
that
is
true
of
a
lot
of
pre-trial
orders
and
that
goes
more
to
the
difficulty
of
showing
prejudicial
error
after
final
judgment
than
to
the
question
of
whether
the
order
ought
to
be
appealable
before
trial.
"
it
also
raises
the
question
in
my
mind
that
if
that
is
true,
is
forum
non
conveniens
objection
that
important?
because
if
it
never
results
in
reversal,
how
important
can
it
be?
and,
indeed,
in
spite
of
his
empirical
study
which
he
has
in
his
brief,
it
is
recognized
that
the
fifth
circuit
very
recently
in
the
gonzales
did,
in
fact,
reverse
a
final
judgment
based
on
forum
non
conveniens.
so,
obviously,
forum
non
conveniens
does
not
involve
the
right
not
to
be
tried.
and,
therefore,
it
fails
the
third
cohen
element
as
well.
with
regard
to
what
has
been
labeled
"immunity"
by
the
petitioner,
which
really
results
from
his
extradition
status
in
this
country,
obviously,
the
label
"immunity"
is
appended
to
that
status
in
order
to
avail
himself
of
the
holding
of
nixon
and
mitchell
which
dealt
with
true
immunity.
that
is
the
right
not
to
undergo
trial.
but
this
is
not
of
that
kind,
obviously.
this
is
in
effect
a
claim
of
defective
service
or
a
claim
of
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction.
whether
it
is
really
immunity
or
not
immunity
isn't
the
issue,
i
don't
think.
the
issue
is
whether
it
passes
the
cohen
land
coopers
&
lybrand
tests.
and,
again,
we
suggest
that
it
does
not
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
i
question
again
whether
this
is
the
kind
of
important
right
that
cohen
was
designed
to
make
collaterally
appealable.
that
doesn't
just
mean
important
to
mr.
van
cauwenberghe.
that
means
according
to
the
commentators
that
the
issue
must
be
settled
by
this
appeal
not
just
for
the
petitioner,
but
for
many
others
similarly
situated.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
first
of
all,
there
isn't
any
indication
that
any
country
in
the
world
has
any
interest
in
whether
this
particular
petitioner
is
served
with
a
civil
summons
while
he
is
in
this
country.
now,
he
has
stated
the
source
of
this
right
to
be
statutes,
treaties,
et
cetera.
well,
i
suggest
that
you
can
search
that
statute,
you
can
search
those
treaties,
and
it
is
not
there.
he
also
says
that
it
derives
from
some
old
cases:
rauscher
from
this
court
over
100
years
ago
and
a
case
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
but
it
is
not
there,
either.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
if
you
want
to
assume
that,
there
is
nothing
anywhere
that
would
indicate
that
switzerland
in
this
case
or
belgium
or
any
other
country--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--yes.
whether
they
would
have
any
concern
about
whether
this
right
was
vindicatable
pre-trial
or
whether
you
had
to
wait
until
the
end
of
the
trial,
i
can't
envision
that
there
would
be
that
kind
of
concern.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
as
to
whether
that
would
be
immediately
appealable?
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
if
it
was
truly
the
right
not
to
stand
trial
in
the
nixon
and
mitchell
sense,
then
i
think
it
would
fall
within
the
three
cohen
criteria
and
could
be
immediately
appealable.
if
it
was
something
less
than
that,
then
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
have
to
await
final
judgment
like
other--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
if...
i
do
not
know
that
much
about
diplomatic
immunity,
but
if
it
means
that
this
person
is
immune
from
arrest,
cannot
be
arrested,
cannot
be
tried,
cannot
be
convicted,
for
this
crime
here,
then--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--this
doesn't
mean
that
at
all.
first
of
all,
this
is
a
civil
matter,
your
honor.
this
man
is
not
being
detained
at
all.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
most
that
he
is,
in
this
particular
situation,
your
honor,
and
i
submit
is
if
his
theory
of
specialty
is
correct,
which
i
submit
it
is
not;
but,
assuming
arguendo
that
it
is
correct,
all
that
means
is
that
the
service
that
we
have
on
him
at
present
is
no
good.
it
does
not
mean
that
we
cannot
sue
him
under
the
california
long
arm
statute
for
committing
a
tort
in
california.
it
does
not
mean
that
we
cannot
get
service
on
him
under
rule
4(e)
or
rule
4(i)
or
under
the
hague
convention.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
but
the
question
is:
does
he
have
the
right
not
to
be
tried.
now,
this
man,
no
way
has
he
the
right
not
to
be
tried.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
you
look
at
double
jeopardy
from
abney
and
you
look
at
absolute
immunity
from
nixon.
that
involves
the
right
not
to
be
tried.
this
involves
a
claim
that
the
service
on
me--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--that's
correct,
yes.
in
any
event,
i
would
like
to
talk
a
minute
about
this
alleged
right
and
its
origins
that
have
been
referred
to
by
opposing
counsel.
first
of
all,
the
treaty
with
switzerland
under
which
this
man
was
extradited
is
set
forth
in
appendix
b
to
petitioner's
brief
on
the
merits.
and
at
page
6a,
what
he
is
protected
against,
assuming
that
this
right
is
viable,
is
that
he
shall
not
be
prosecuted
or
punished
for
any
offense
committed
before
the
demand
for
extradition
other
than
that
for
which
the
extradition
is
granted.
now,
clearly,
that
speaks
only
in
terms
of
criminal
prosecutions.
now,
the
statute
that
he
relies
on,
which
is
also
set
forth
in
his
brief,
there
are
two
of
them.
the
first,
18
usc
3186
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
that
is
the
secretary
of
state's
duties
when
the
united
states
is
extraditing
someone
to
a
foreign
country.
the
other
one,
3192,
requires
the
president,
it
says,
"he
shall
have
the
power
to
take
all
necessary
measures
for
the
transportation
and
safe
keeping
of
such
accused
person.
"
i
suggest
it
takes
a
tremendous
strain
to
argue
that
that
means
that
the
president
must
protect
this
man
against
the
service
of
a
civil
summons.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
of
criminal,
only.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
it
was
a
criminal
prosecution
for
a
different
crime
in
a
situation
where
the
queen
of
england
was
obviously
miffed
about
the
possibility
of
her
national
being
prosecuted
for
a
different
crime.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
what
it
does
is
it
affects
whether
there
is
a
right
nor
not.
for
instance,
judge
friendly
in
the
second
circuit
held
that
in
the
absence
of
a
complaint
by
the
rendering
country,
there
is
no
restriction
on
prosecution
for
a
separate
crime.
in
the
najohn
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
this
very
treaty
from
switzerland
was
used
to
prosecute
for
another
crime.
and
the
government
of
switzerland
had
no
objection
to
that.
so,
if
they
had
no
objection
to
that,
how
could
they
have
any
objection
to
the
service
of
a
civil
summons
on
this
particular
belgian
national?
now,
no
case...
no
case
has
ever
held--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
clearly,
the
right
is
that
of
the
country.
but
the
individual,
if
the
right
exists,
is
sort
of
a
third
party
beneficiary
of
that
right
and
has
standing,
certainly.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
but
part
of
the
problem
in
determining
whether
the
right
exists
requires
an
examination
of
the
elements,
the
merits
of
the
case,
if
you
will,
and
gets
you
into
the
kind
of
analysis
that
i
think
prevents
the
second
cohen
factor
from
being
met
in
that
it
is
not
completely
separate
from
the
merits.
most
of
the
time
when
you
are
talking
about
a
collateral
appeal,
you
are
dealing
with
a
recognized
right.
and
the
question
is:
does
it
apply
here?
well,
i
suggest
that
there
is
a
big
threshold
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
there
is
a
right
at
all.
you
see,
the
basis
of
specialty
and
the
basis
for
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
i
think
it
requires
you
to
look
at
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
look
at
the
criminal
case
that
preceded
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
and
have
a
determination
made
of
whether
the
foreign
country
really
cares
about
whether
there
is
a
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
but
it
doesn't.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
i
think
you
do
have
to
engage
in
an
analysis.
maybe
it
is
not
the
same
kind
as
you
do
with
forum
non
conveniens.
it
is
a
closer
question
as
to
whether
this
second
element
is
met
here.
but
the
third
element,
again,
i
don't
think
they
can
fall
within
the
criterion.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
at
all?
no.
i
don't
agree
that
in
this
country
it
isn't--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--if
it
were?
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
if
it
were...
if
he
were
immune
from
suit,
then
depending
on
the
source
of
the
immunity,
but
i
think
i
would
be
willing
to
agree
that
if
he
were
actually
immune
from
suit
in
the
nixon
sense,
then
a
collateral
appeal
would
perhaps
be
appropriate.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
think
that
the
macdonald,
jeffrey
macdonald
case
which
involved
speedy
trial
delay.
now,
here
is
a
man
who
claimed
he
couldn't
be
tried
because
the
government
had
waited
too
long.
it
was
a
personal
right,
he
said,
"if
i
am
put
through
all
this
agony
and
grief,
i
have
lost
that
right
forever.
"
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no
court,
to
my
knowledge,
has
ever
held
that
defective
service
of
process
is
immediately
appealable.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
this
court
held
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
in
catlin
that
personal
jurisdiction
denials
are
not
immediately
appealable
and
that
certainly
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--i
think
so
on
the
jurisdictional
issue.
yes,
sir.
i
would
also
like
to
mention
that
there
is,
there
are
other
bases
of
jurisdiction
here
and
this
is
why
we
are
not
talking
about
the
right
not
to
be
tried.
because
if
the
court
were
to
have
sustained
this
motion
based
on
his
extradition
status,
the
proper
ruling
would
not
have
been
to
dismiss
the
case.
the
proper
ruling
would
have
been
to
quash
the
service
and
then
we
would
have
been
allowed
to
try
to
find
another
basis
of
jurisdiction
and
another
basis
for
service
of
process.
and
we
would
have
been
able
to
do
that
assuming
that
he
didn't
stay
in
california.
i
guess
that
is
the
real
rub.
so,
in
our
view,
neither
order
that
is
presently
before
the
court
is
immediately
appealable
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine
any
more
than
any
other
jurisdiction
or
venue
motion.
we
think
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
dismissing
the
appeal
was
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
