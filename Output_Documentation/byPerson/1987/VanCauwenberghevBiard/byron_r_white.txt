when
you
talk
about
immunity,
are
you
talking
about
freedom
from
service?
justice
white
unless
you
say
it
is
just
a
right
not
to
be
tried
at
all
in
this
country.
justice
white
well,
what
if
it
were?
justice
white
i
thought
you
said
then
it
would
be
a
nixon,
abney
kind
of
case.
justice
white
what
is
the
closest
case
here
in
our
court
holding
that
a
particular
order
isn't
appealable?
what
is
the
closest
case
that
you
could
rely
on?
justice
white
what
about
the
defective
service
cases?
justice
white
well,
is
there
a
case
here
that
says
they
aren't?
justice
white
isn't
that
the
closest
case
here?
justice
white
what
if
this
gentleman
had
come
to
this
country
not...
he
wasn't
extradited,
he
just
came
here.
he
certainly
was
subject
to
suit
here;
wasn't
he?
on
those
facts?
justice
white
that
isn't
the
same
kind
of
immunity
you
have
been
talking
about
with
abney
or
nixon.
justice
white
well,
if
you
won
this
case
and
the
next
day
he
came
back
here
over,
against
your
advice,
he
would
be
subject
to
suit;
wouldn't
he?
justice
white
well,
why
isn't
this
just
a
case
of
defective
service,
of
failure
to
get
personal
jurisdiction?
justice
white
well,
what
if
this
was
a
suit
in
the
federal
court
and
the
objection
is
that
this
man
just
wasn't
subject
to
being
sued
in
a
federal
court
in
the
state
of
new
mexico.
justice
white
but
the
claim
is
he
is
not
subject
to
suit
in
new
mexico.
he
just
shouldn't
be
sued
in
new
mexico.
"you
shouldn't
make
me
stand
trial
here.
"
justice
white
then
all
it
means
is
that
ordinarily,
they
are
not
appealable.
