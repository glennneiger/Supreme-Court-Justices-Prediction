justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question
that
is
somewhat
like
justice
o'connor's.
supposing
during
the
period
that
your
claimed
immunity
applies
while
he
is
still
on
probation,
he
is
here,
but
he
also
owns
a
home
here,
has
a
business
here
and
would
have
been
subject
to
civil
process
even
if
he
had
been
physically
out
of
the
country,
would
the
service
be
good?
justice
stevens
but
then
suppose
he
makes
the
motion
in
the
district
court
on
the
grounds
he
did
here
and
the
plaintiff
says,
"well,
he
is
subject
to
process.
"
"he
has
got
a
house
here.
"
and
they
deny
it
and
there
is
a
factual
dispute
on
that
and
they
get
into
an
argument
on
the
facts,
would
the
resolution
of
that
factual
dispute
be
appealable
just
like
your
claim
would
be?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
this
issue
need
not
always
arise
in
the
pristine
clear
posture
in
which
you
describe
this.
justice
stevens
but
there
have
been
so
few
appeals
of
this
question.
how
do
you
explain
that?
justice
stevens
there
have
been
so
few
appeals
on
this.
justice
stevens
well,
then
aren't
you
sure
to
win
at
the
end
of
the
ball
game
in
that
case?
justice
stevens
yes,
right.
justice
stevens
in
this
case,
was
there
also
an
attempt
to
obtain
jurisdiction
by
attachment
of
his
property?
justice
stevens
just
let
me
interrupt
you.
but
if
there
is
a
right
to
not
to
be
served
that
is
clearly
separate
from
the
merits
of
the
underlying
controversy.
justice
stevens
why?
justice
stevens
well,
in
the
plain
language
of
the
treaty,
and
the
man
is
a
third
party
beneficiary--
justice
stevens
--i
know
because
that
doesn't
in
terms
apply
to
civil.
justice
stevens
but
if
it
did
apply
to
civil,
if
he
is
a
third
party
beneficiary
of
the
treaty,
i
do
not
know
why
you
have
to
worry
about
whether
switzerland
cares
or
not.
