justice
kennedy
is
this
like
immunity
from
personal
jurisdiction...
is
this
like
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction?
justice
kennedy
you
have
to
say
that
because
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction
is
not
appealable.
justice
kennedy
why
shouldn't
the
rule
of
non-appealability
be
the
same,
though?
it
is
very
close;
isn't
it?
