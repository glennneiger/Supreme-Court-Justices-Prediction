justice
o'connor
mr.
kester,
is
the
petitioner
still
in
the
united
states
and
still
under
the
probation
order?
justice
o'connor
and
that
is
where
he
is?
justice
o'connor
mr.
kester,
how
broad
is
this
rule
of
specialty
do
you
think?
suppose
that
your
client
was
here
under
extradition
and
convicted
as
he
was
here
and
placed
on
probation
as
he
was
here,
and
while
on
probation
had
an
auto
accident
and
his
negligence
caused
damage
to
somebody
else,
do
you
think
he
is
immune
so
to
speak
from
suit
for
that
auto
accident?
justice
o'connor
crime,
a
tort.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
walsh,
do
you
think
it
has
in
this
sense
perhaps
some
international
implications?
i
would
think
that
another
country
concerned
about
extradition
matters
might
be
quite
concerned
if
that
issue
could
not
be
resolved
on
a
timely
basis
in
a
case.
i
wonder
if
there
aren't
broader
implications.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
you
have
two
points.
one,
you
say
the
rule
of
specialty
just
doesn't
cover
it.
justice
o'connor
and
then,
secondly,
is
the
appealability
question.
i
guess
my
question
assumed
that
the
rule
might
cover
it.
justice
o'connor
i
am
talking
about
the
generality
of
this
situation.
justice
o'connor
what
about
a
diplomatic
immunity
question?
a
suit
against
a
diplomat?
justice
o'connor
yes.
