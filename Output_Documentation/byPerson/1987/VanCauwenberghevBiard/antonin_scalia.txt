justice
scalia
it
didn't
involve
a
civil
case.
justice
scalia
it
also
did
not
involve
a
civil
case.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
how
do
we
know
that
this
is
any
different?
why
is
this
something
more
than
simply
a
right
not
to
have
a
judgment
entered
against
you
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
you
were
here
in
this
country
by
reason
of
compulsory
operation
of
the
treaty?
justice
scalia
well,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction.
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
bring
you
to
trial.
does
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
kesler,
do
you
want
to
say
something
about
forum
non
conveniens?
justice
scalia
i
thought
you
might.
justice
scalia
do
you
think
it
is
an
important
issue?
justice
scalia
is
it
an
important
issue
in
the
sense
that
you
are
going
to
get
a
fair
trial
either
way.
that
is
the
assumption
of
the
venue
statute
that
so
long
as
these
minimals
are
met,
you
have
the
basic
conditions
for
a
fair
trail.
so,
is
it
really
important
enough
whether
you
can
be
tried
here
or
somewhere
else?
there
is
some
inconvenience
to
the
parties,
but
is
it
going
to
do
any
injustice?
justice
scalia
well,
that
may
be
a
problem
with
the
venue
statute.
i
mean
there
are
a
lot
of
times
when
it
is
very
expensive
for
a
civil
litigant
to
litigate
before
one
of
the
courts
where
venue
is
established,
but
once
you
have
made
the
judgment
that
venue
properly
lies
there,
forum
non
conveniens...
it
is
a
nice
thing
to
make
it
more
convenient
if
possible,
but
does
it
rise
to
the
level
of
injustice
that
qualifies
for
that
condition
of
importance?
justice
scalia
how
do
we
know
which
is
which?
that
is
just
not
a
very
comforting...
you
can
describe
both
of
them
that
way.
justice
scalia
i
think
that
is
the
same
thing
this
one
means.
justice
scalia
i
understand
that.
but
i
don't
understand
it
to
mean
you
can
be
tried,
but
the
judgment
is
just
no
good.
that
is
never
how
i
have
heard
it
described.
to
the
extent
it
exists
in
both
the
criminal
and
the
civil
context,
it
is
usually
expressed
as
the
fact
that
he
is
immune,
he
is
exempt
from
the
judicial
process.
justice
scalia
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
diplomats,
of
course.
there
are
other
ways
in
which
you
can
get
jurisdiction
over
them.
justice
scalia
i
understand.
you
are
right
that
that
is
the
question.
and
i
don't
know
where
one
goes
about
seeking
an
answer
to
it.
justice
scalia
we
said
so.
justice
scalia
your
argument:
there
is
no
individual
right
under
this
treaty
and
that
the
only
time
a
court
should
stay
its
hand
is
when
the
country,
itself,
objects.
it
confers
rights
only
on
the
government,
not
on
the
individual?
justice
scalia
i
was
about
to
say:
you
can
say
that
about
every
treaty.
and
we
certainly
have
allowed
people
to
sue
on
the
basis
of
rights
that
they
assertedly
have
by
treaty.
