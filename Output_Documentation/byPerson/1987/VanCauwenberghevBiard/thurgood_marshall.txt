how
long
does
that
run?
justice
marshall
it
isn't
quite
the
same
type
of
thing
as
mitchell
v.
forsyth
where
the
immunity
was
permanent.
justice
marshall
assuming
he
is
convicted
and
sentenced
to
prison,
does
that
end
his
immunity?
justice

from
prison?
justice

i
say
he
is
in
prison.
justice

for
80
years.
does
his
immunity
end?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
first
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
we
hold
in
that
case
that
neither
an
order
denying
a
motion
to
dismiss
based
on
an
extradited
personâ€™s
claim
that
he
is
immune
from
civil
process
nor
an
order
denying
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
of
forum
non
conveniens
is
a
collateral
order
subject
to
appeal
as
a
final
judgment
under
28
u.s.c.
1291.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
