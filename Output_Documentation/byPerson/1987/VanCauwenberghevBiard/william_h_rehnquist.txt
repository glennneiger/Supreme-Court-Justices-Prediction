chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kester,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
held
otherwise
than
there
was
absolute
immunity?
chief
justice
rehnquist
freedom
of
service
because
of
the
particular
circumstances
surrounding
his
visit
to
this
country.
you
know,
if
he
came
to
this
country
at
some
other
time,
he
could
have
been
served
and
there
would
have
been
no
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
wasn't
going
to
come
back,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
rehnquist
analytically,
it
is
like
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction.
i
mean
anybody
can
defined
the
rights
so
as
to
win
this
particular
case:
the
right
not
to
be
brought
to
trial
as
opposed
to
the
right
not
to
have
a
judgment
entered
against
you.
those
are
just
little
nuances
of
expression.
i
don't
think
they
carry
the
day
one
way
or
the
other.
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
federal
statute
that
says:
you
shall
not
bring
this
guy
to
trial
in
a
criminal
case
when
he
is
here
under
these
circumstances.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
have
personal
jurisdiction
statutes
and
constitutional
provisions
that
say
it
takes
a
certain
amount
of
contact
in
order
to
hail
a
guy
into
court.
well,
what
is
the
difference?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
does
it
differ
from
the
personal
jurisdiction
principle?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no.
but
how
do
you
distinguish?
you
say
it
is
a
different
right.
it
is
a
right
not
to
have
a
judgment
entered
against
you
as
opposed
to
not
being
brought
to
trial?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
just
don't
think
those
are
of
really
controlling
significance.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
how
about
the
policy
that
protects
someone
from
being
hailed
into
court
where
there
are
insufficient
contacts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
know?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
why
should
that
make
it
lean
in
your
favor,
the
fact
that
it
is
not
a
general
provision
that
applies
to
everybody?
if
it
is
such
a
good
idea,
why
don't
we...
why
shouldn't
we
extend
it
across
the
board?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kester.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
walsh.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
rauscher
case,
i
guess,
decided
it
should
protect
him
against
the
service
of
a
criminal--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
does
the
individual
myth
in
each
case
contribute
to
the
appealability
or
not?
whether
a
particular
foreign
nation
is
outraged
that
we
are
not
speeding
this
thing
up?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
walsh.
mr.
kester,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
macdonald
made
the
same
argument,
that
he
had
a
clean
clear
case,
that
the
speedy
trial
thing
had
been
violated
and
should
not
have...
the
thing
should
have
been
dismissed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
those
protections
are
less
important
than
treaty
protection?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kester.
your
time
is
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases,
no.
87-336,
van
cauwenberghe
versus
biard,
no.
87-498,
berkovitz
versus
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
