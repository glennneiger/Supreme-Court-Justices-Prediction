justice
white
what
grounds
did
the
prosecutor
give
for
moving?
justice
white
he
just
said
what,
please
have
closed-circuit
or
a
screen?
justice
white
when
what?
justice
white
when
what?
justice
white
and
he
could
see
the
witnesses?
justice
white
at
least
there
was
no
intention
of
obstructing
his
view
of
the
witnesses.
justice
white
were
they
the
first
witnesses?
justice
white
what
difference
does
it
make
if
it's
glaring
or
not?
justice
white
i
guess
the
jury
would
say,
well,
there's
a
screen
there
and
the
only
thing
that
is
screened
is
the
witness's
view
of
the
defendant.
the
jury
could
see
that.
justice
white
what
would
the
jury
think...
well,
the
court
doesn't
want
the
witnesses,
these
children,
to
see
that
fellow?
now,
you
say...
if
that's
the
fact,
what
inferences
do
you
think--
justice
white
would
you
be
satisfied
if
the
defendant
was
outside
the
courtroom
in
a
room
with
a
one
way
glass
looking
in?
justice
white
it
seems
to
me
a
normal
thing
to
ask
witnesses
like
that
would
be,
do
you
see
your
assailant
in
this
room.
justice
white
you
would
think
that
the
screen
would
completely
foreclose
an
answer
to
such
a
question.
justice
white
i
would
think
the
defense
would
always
want
to
ask
if
they
knew,
which
they
did
from
their
depositions,
that
the
girls
could
not
identify
this
person.
justice
white
i
don't
see
any
argument
by
defense
counsel
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
he
is
objecting
to
this
is
because
it
will
keep
me
from
asking
this
question.
justice
white
and
i
think
he
said
from
the
depositions
it
is
clear
that
the
young
ladies
can't
identify.
justice
white
so
defense
counsel
never
said
the
biggest
trouble
with
screen
is
i
can't
ask
these
girls
if
they
can
identify
the
defendant?
justice
white
and
i
suppose
certainly
the
prosecution
wouldn't
have
wanted
the
screen
if
they
thought
there
could
be
an
in-court
identification.
justice
white
yes,
and
when
he
was
talking
about
the
eyewitness
identification
he
said,
yes,
there
is
a
real
problem
about
that.
maybe
the
legislature
didn't
even
think
of
this,
but
nevertheless,
he
seemed
to
say
he
had
to
do
it.
justice
white
suppose
the
statute
were
mandatory
every
single
time.
you
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
you
just
said
a
while
ago
it
would
be.
justice
white
i
take
it
then
that
you
think
it
should
be
on
a
case
to
case
basis
of
whether
there
was
a
danger
of
trauma
or
not.
justice
white
how
does
a
defense
counsel
satisfy
that
kind
of
a
burden
with
respect
to
prosecution
witnesses?
justice
white
well,
they
did.
justice
white
they
certainly
did.
justice
white
how
could
he
say
anything
factual
about
these
witnesses?
justice
white
i
guess
he
took
their
depositions,
didn't
he?
justice
white
it
seems
to
be
a
due
process
problem
if
there
is
a
problem
at
all.
justice
white
because
the
confrontation
clause
is
just
beside
the
point.
in
any
case
you
could
have
the
defendant
outside
the
courtroom
with
a
one
way
mirror.
that
wouldn't
violate
the
sixth
amendment.
whether
there
is
any
trauma
or
not.
justice
white
so
just
so
the
jury
can
see
him
and
the
witness.
justice
white
yes,
and
that
the
defendant
can
see
the
witness.
justice
white
so
that
just
leaves
the
question
of
prejudice
from
the
way
they
do
it.
justice
white
the
court...
do
you
think
with
respect
to
face
to
face
confrontation
+/-
justice
white
what
is
the
closest
case
in
this
court
suggesting
that
the
confrontation
clause
requires
face
to
face--
justice
white
--i
just
asked
you
about
a
case.
justice
white
i
know,
but
what
is
the
case
that
says
that
to
satisfy
the
confrontation
clause
there
must
be
eyeball
to
eyeball
or
face
to
face.
justice
white
none
in
this
court.
