fourteen
or
under
is--
justice
stevens
--i
see.
were
depositions
taken
of
the
two
girls
before?
justice
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
tells
us
whether
there
were
any
objection
to
the
defendant
being
present
at
those
depositions?
justice
stevens
he
was
not
at
the
depositions.
is
there
anything
in
those
depositions
to
indicate
they
were
concerned
about
confronting
him
in
person?
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
that.
justice
stevens
mr.
allen,
can't
you
make
precisely
the
same
argument
the
other
way?
the
state
hasn't
offered
a
bit
of
evidence
that
the
child
witnesses
would
be
traumatized.
there
is
nothing
in
their
testimony
to
suggest
any
fear
on
their
part.
justice
stevens
if
you
say
there
is
a
presumption
in
every
case
by
reason
of
the
legislature's
action.
but
in
this
particular
record
with
regard
to
these
particular
children,
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever,
is
there?
justice
stevens
no
evidence.
justice
stevens
what?
justice
stevens
he
hadn't
even
seen
the
children
before,
had
he?
justice
stevens
but
he
ruled
before
he
ever
saw
the
children.
justice
stevens
what
does
that
mean?
he
knew
they
were
thirteen
years
old.
justice
stevens
how
do
you
know
that?
what
is
the
evidence
of
that?
justice
stevens
where?
what
in
the
record
would
support
that
proposition?
did
they
have
any
evidence
of
any
kind,
or
is
it
just
the
fact
that
they're
thirteen?
justice
stevens
pardon
me?
justice
stevens
your
argument
is
they
haven't
put
in
any
evidence
of
absence
of
trauma,
and
all
i'm
suggesting
is
you
haven't
put
in
any
evidence
of
trauma.
you
rely
entirely
on
the
fact
that
the
state
legislature
says
that
this
procedure
may
be
used
when
a
child
testifies.
it
doesn't
say
it
must
be
used.
it
doesn't
say
it
must
be
used
in
all
cases.
justice
stevens
it
says
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
justice
stevens
then
how
do
we
know
there's
a
legislative
finding
that
it
must
be
used
in
all
cases,
or
that
even
the
inference
of
trauma
is
justified
in
all
cases?
justice
stevens
yes.
the
legislature
didn't
say
that.
it
said
it
may
be
used
if
the
trial
judge
so
decides.
justice
stevens
if
that
statement
were
that
trauma
was
the
norm,
it
would
say
that
it
must
be
used.
it
doesn't
say
it
must
be
used;
it
says
it
may
be
used.
all
that
suggests
is
that
trauma
is
always
a
possibility
with
children
under
fourteen.
justice
stevens
i
don't
find
it
there.
what
language
are
you
talking
about?
justice
stevens
so
there
is
no
rebuttable
presumption
in
the
statute.
justice
stevens
and
that
puts
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
explain
why
the
statute
is
not
necessary
in
the
particular
case,
why
the
procedure--
justice
stevens
--but
that's
certainly
not
based
on
the
text
of
the
statute.
if
the
statute
really
said
the
judge
may
do
it
if
he
believes
there
is
a
danger
of
trauma,
you
might
be
able...
if
the
judge
didn't
make
any
findings
but
nevertheless
provided
the
screen...
to
assume
he
knew
what
the
norm
was,
the
standard
was,
and
that
he
thought
there
was
trauma.
the
difficulty
i
have
in
reading
this
record
is
it
sounds
to
me
like
the
judge
thought
it
was
mandatory.
he
just
thought
he
had
to
do
it.
justice
stevens
and
dimly
see
them
according
to
the
way
the
judge
described
it
when
he
looked
through
the
screen.
justice
stevens
no.
it
is
to
stand
face
to
face.
it's
not
just
that
he
see
them,
it's
that
they
see
him.
you
know
the
saying,
look
me
in
the
eye
and
say
that.
you've
heard
people
say
that.
it
means,
you
know,
you're
lying
and
you
won't
say
it
to
me
face.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
that
clause,
and
you're
saying
here,
we
can
simply
say
you
don't
need
it
when
there
is
a
juvenile
witness.
now
what
basis?
if
it
were
the
development
of
closed-circuit
television
i
could
understand
it,
but
you
could
have
constructed
a
screen
like
this
in
1791.
mr.
allen,
do
you
agree
that
this
statute
does
not
apply
to
every
case?
justice
stevens
mr.
allen,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
statute.
i
don't
read
it
as
being
limited
to
cases
in
which
the
child
witness
is
necessarily
a
victim
of
any
particular
kind
of
crime.
it
applies
to
every
case
in
which
there
is
a
child
witness,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
it
would
apply
in
a
robbery
case
where
the
child
was
just
a
witness
to
some
phase
of
the
robbery,
not
necessarily
saw
the
actual
event?
justice
stevens
it
could
if
it
was
a
very
traumatized
child?
justice
stevens
mr.
allen,
you
can't
really
predict
that
here.
supposing
you
just
asked
the
judge
to
call
the
girls
in
and
say,
do
you
know
this
man
who
lived
next
door
to
you
before
this
event,
have
you
ever
talked
to
him,
does
it
bother
you
to
testify
in
his
presence,
and
they
said,
no,
we
don't
care.
i
mean,
that's
conceivable.
justice
stevens
you
don't
have
to
have
fourteen
psychiatrists
testify
when
things
are
rather
clear.
justice
stevens
mr.
allen,
let
me
ask
you
another
question
about
your
legal
position.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
in
which
older
people
also
suffer
severe
trauma
when
they
are
forced
to
confront
someone
with
whom
they've
had
a
violent
experience
of
some
kind.
would
it
not
be
correct
that
if
your
argument
is
sound
with
respect
to
a
thirteen
year
old
that
it
would
equally
apply
to
70
year
old
or
an
85
year
old
person
who
is
just
scared
to
death
of
the
person
she
has
to
testify
in
front
of?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
part
of
their
testimony
was
critical
in
hooking
up
the
defendant
to
this
particular
incident.
