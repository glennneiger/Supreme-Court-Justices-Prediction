justice
marshall
counsel,
what,
if
anything,
shows
who,
if
anybody,
asked
for
this?
justice
marshall
when
was
the
defendant
told
about
this?
i
mean,
you
said
he
made
his
request
a
week
ahead
of
time.
justice
marshall
was
the
defendant
advised
of
that?
justice
marshall
did
he
object
or
not?
justice
marshall
counsel,
is
the
colloquy
between
the
judge
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
this
record?
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
you
don't
know
the
exact
page?
i
guess
it
is
the
early
part
of
the
trial.
justice
marshall
because
you
keep
emphasizing
the
fact
that
this
singles
them
out.
justice
marshall
well,
as
the
chief
justice
said,
in
a
criminal
trial,
a
criminal
defendant
is
automatically
singled
out.
justice
marshall
so
you've
got
to
have
something
more
than
that.
justice
marshall
if
he
is
singled
out,
at
most
of
the
trials,
the
prosecuting
witness
says,
and
this
is
the
man
that
did
it.
justice
marshall
and
the
court
says,
let
the
record
show
that
is
the
one
he
is
talking
about.
justice
marshall
that
is
just
the
same
as
is
done
here.
justice
marshall
your
additional
point
is
that
it
says
the
children
are
afraid
of
him.
now
that,
i
think,
is
a
good
point.
but
i
don't
think
it
is
a
valid
point
to
keep
emphasizing
that
he
is
singled
out.
justice
marshall
they
knew
he
was
in
jail.
justice
marshall
well,
this
man
wasn't
in
jail.
justice
marshall
i
don't
want
to
waste
your
time.
forget
about
it.
justice
marshall
but
he
did
say
he
claimed
his
sixth
amendment
rights.
justice
marshall
right.
justice
marshall
may
i
ask,
what
is
the
definition
of
a
child
in
iowa?
justice
marshall
to
every
rape
case
with
children
involved.
justice
marshall
and
you
must
put
the
screen
up?
justice
marshall
and
discretion
to
the
judge?
justice
marshall
well,
will
you
tell
me
in
this
record
where
the
judge
says,
in
my
discretion,
i
rule
that
the
screen
must
be
used
in
this
case?
justice
marshall
don't
miss
page
18
while
you're
at
it.
he
never
at
any
time
said
that
in
this
particular
case
these
particular
people
needed
this
protection.
he
never
said
it,
did
he?
justice
marshall
he
never
said
it,
did
he?
justice
marshall
so
what
he
said
was
this
statute
applies
automatically.
justice
marshall
but
isn't
that
some
of
what
he
said?
justice
marshall
what
do
you
believe
he
said.
justice
marshall
he
said
that?
justice
marshall
don't
you
think
he
was
obliged
to
say
something?
the
statute
didn't
say
you
must
do
it.
justice
marshall
oh,
you
would
like
a
better
record.
i
bet
you
would.
justice
marshall
there's
not
one
word
in
this
record
that
the
person
involved
asked
for
this.
justice
marshall
there's
not
one
word
that
says
either
the
child,
the
parent,
or
anybody
asked
for
this.
justice
marshall
wouldn't
your
record
have
been
better
if
he'd
said
they
asked
me
to
do
it?
justice
marshall
he
said
that
there
not
be
a
trial?
justice
marshall
when
did
these
two
young
girls
identify
this
man?
justice
marshall
a
man
who
was
never
identified
and
he
was
convicted.
justice
marshall
well,
then
why
were
they
scared
to
look
at
him?
justice
marshall
they
couldn't
identify
him.
justice
marshall
i
don't
find
one
word
of
trauma
in
this
record.
justice
marshall
i
have
difficulty
in
deciding
cases
on
presumptions,
i
have
great
difficulty.
mr.
allen,
one
part
of
their
testimony
really
was
quite
critical
for
identification
purposes,
wasn't
it?
he
was
wearing
his
watch
in
a
particular
way?
