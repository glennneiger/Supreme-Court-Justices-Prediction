justice
o'connor
what
did
the
trial
court
judge
instruct
the
jury
about
this
device
and
the
reason
for
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
would
like
you
to
comment
on
whether
it
isn't
the
case
that
kind
of
instruction
to
the
jury
certainly
takes
away
much
of
the
thrust
of
what
you
say
was
the
inevitable
consequence
of
use
of
the
device.
justice
o'connor
i
thought
the
people
who
were
singled
out
were
the
child
witnesses,
not
the
defendant.
justice
o'connor
mr.
papak,
if
express
findings
had
been
made
by
the
trial
court
judge
that
it
was
necessary
and
appropriate
in
this
case,
would
you
be
here?
justice
o'connor
so
that's
irrelevant,
really,
to
your
argument.
justice
o'connor
you
spend
a
lot
of
time
talking
about
the
need
for
findings,
but
i'm
not
clear
that
that
would
solve
it
in
your
view.
justice
o'connor
well,
here
the
findings
were
in
effect
made
by
the
state
legislature,
weren't
they?
justice
o'connor
--but
that
isn't
what
they
were
instructed.
the
jury
was
told
that
this
device
was
used
because
the
state
law
required
it.
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
what
they
were
told.
justice
o'connor
well,
apparently
the
judge
thought
he
had
to
do
one
or
the
other.
justice
o'connor
his
instruction
reads
a
little
that
way,
doesn't
it?
