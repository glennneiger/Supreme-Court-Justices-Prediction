did
they
identify
them?
justice
blackmun
in
what
way
then
was
it
critical?
justice
blackmun
do
you
think
this
is
a
more
serious
affront
to
constitutional
rights
than
holbrook
was?
justice
blackmun
in
what
respect?
justice

uniformed
storm
troopers
almost,
with
weapons
apparent.
justice

it

made
pretty
strenuously.

what
would
you
be
satisfied
with
in
this
case?
justice
blackmun
no
screen
at

justice
blackmun
well,
then
aren't
you
violating
some
other
so-called
rights
by
having
a
trial
outside
the
courtroom?
justice
blackmun
you
would
have
been
happy
with
a
videotape
outside
the
courtroom?
justice
blackmun
would
you
be
content
with
it
is
what
i
am
asking.
justice
blackmun
mr.
allen,
is
correct,
as
i
get
from
the
briefs,
iowa
is
the
only
state
with
this
kind
of
a
statute?
justice
blackmun
do
you
know
what
brought
it
about
in
iowa?
was
there
some
particular
trial
or
case
that
lead
to
this
legislative
action?
justice
blackmun
but
iowa
is
the
only
one
that
adopted
it?
justice
blackmun
of
course,
all
this
argument
overlooks
the
obvious
fact
that
some
prosecutor
or
defense
counsel
and
some
witnesses
are
blind,
and
yet
it
doesn't
cause
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble.
there
is
no
eyeball
to
eyeball
confrontation
there.
