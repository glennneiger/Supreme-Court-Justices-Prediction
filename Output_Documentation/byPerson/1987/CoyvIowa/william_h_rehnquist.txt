justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
86-6757,
john
avery
coy
v.
iowa.
mr.
papak,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
had
already
been
indicted
on
these
charges
of
child
molestation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
papak,
in
estelle,
as
i
recall,
the
court
saw
no
state
purpose
at
all
or
state
inference
served
by
the
jail
garb.
it
is
pure
coincidence,
really,
that
the
guy
had
it
on.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
here
i'm
sure
that
the
state
argues
there
is
a
purpose
served
here
which
would
distinguish
it
from
estelle,
i
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
a
separate
argument,
that
could
have
been
met
in
other
ways
that
were
less
prejudicial
in
your
view.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
seems
to
me
your
case
is
different
from
estelle
in
that
there
was
no
interest
that
this
court
thought
was
served
by
having
the
guy
go
to
trial
in
prison
garb.
here
there
are
quite
obviously
some
reasons
why
child
witnesses
should
be
treated
differently
with
respect
to
the
accused
defendant
than
other
people.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
should
it
be
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
why
can't
the
legislature
say,
as
the
iowa
legislature
did,
that
in
the
case
of
child
witnesses,
if
there
is
any
problem
the
court
may
use
this
procedure?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
should
it
have
to
be
mandatory?
why
can't
they
leave
it
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
when
it's
needed
in
his
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
all
sorts
of
discretionary
decisions
made
in
the
criminal
process
at
every
stage...
and
i
don't
think
we've
ever
said
that
every
discretionary
decision
must
be
supported
by
some
articulated
basis
for
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why?
chief
justice
rehnquist
has
this
court
ever
applied
the
need
for
the
articulated
reason
for
closing,
in
the
globe
newspaper
case
which
you
refer
to,
in
the
context
of
the
criminal
process?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
papak.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
allen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
allen.
mr.
papak,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
papak.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-6757
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
