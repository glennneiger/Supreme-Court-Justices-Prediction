mr.
paul
papak
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
november
13
of
1985
in
the
small
town
of
clinton,
iowa,
twelve
members
of
a
criminal
jury
witnessed
an
unprecedented
and
extraordinary
event.
following
opening
statements
by
the
county
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel,
the
court
ordered
the
bailiff
to
turn
off
the
courtroom
lights
and
to
close
the
window
blinds.
and
with
that
court
thrust
in
near
total
darkness--
mr.
paul
papak
pardon
me?
mr.
paul
papak
--thirty-some
thousand,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
papak
thirty-some
thousand,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
papak
relatively
small
town.
mr.
paul
papak
yes.
a
large
wooden
structure,
over
six
feet
tall
and
four
feet
wide,
was
dragged
into
the
courtroom
past
the
members
of
the
criminal
jury
and
placed
directly
in
front
of
the
defendant
at
counsel
table.
then
a
panel
of
four
spotlights,
the
only
lights
in
the
courtroom,
were
turned
on
and
focused
directly
on
the
screening
structure,
illuminating
it
and
emphasizing
it
for
everyone
in
the
courtroom.
finally,
two
thirteen
year
old
girls,
one
at
a
time,
were
ushered
into
the
courtroom
through
a
special
door
to
give
critical
testimony
as
the
state's
first
and
primary
witnesses
against
the
defendant,
john
avery
coy.
mr.
paul
papak
they
never
identified
him--
mr.
paul
papak
--their
testimony
was
critical
in,
of
course,
establishing
that
an
assault
did
occur
and
in
identifying
much
of
the
circumstantial
evidence
that
was
used
or
attempted
to
be
used
to
tie
in
mr.
coy
to
this
particular
crime,
your
honor.
that
the
jury
eventually
convicted
mr.
coy
despite
the
paucity
of
incriminating
evidence
offered
by
the
state
is
not
surprising.
screening
a
defendant
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
made
a
guilty
verdict
all
by
inevitable.
using
a
screening
device
in
the
presence
of
those
members
of
the
jury
signaled
to
each
member
of
that
jury
that
this
defendant
was
somehow
different
from
each
of
them,
that
he
was
a
clear
and
present
danger
not
only
to
these
child
witnesses
but
to
the
children
of
the
community
generally,
and
that
he
was
undoubtedly
guilty
of
the
crime
charged.
mr.
paul
papak
he
gave
instruction,
your
honor,
after
the
first
witness
was
called
to
the
stand,
and
from
the
record
it
is
the
only
reference
to
instruction
in
the
record:
"that
it's
quite
obvious
to
the
jury
that
there
is
a
screening
device
in
the
courtroom.
"
"the
general
assembly
recently
passed
a
law
which
provides
for
this
sort
of
procedure
in
cases
involving
children.
"
"now
i
would
caution
you,
and
i
would
caution
you
later,
that
you
are
to
draw
no
inferences
of
any
kind
from
the
presence
of
that
screen.
"
would
you
like
me
to
go
on,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
papak
no,
i
think
it
does
not,
justice
o'connor.
i
think,
as
the
supreme
court
properly
recognized,
when
you
are
dealing
with
inherently
prejudicial
devices
during
the
course
of
a
criminal
trial,
you
simply
can't
instruct
away
the
subconscious
effect
of
singling
out
this
particular
person
in
the
courtroom
for
such
obvious
different
treatment.
mr.
paul
papak
it
wasn't
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
child
witnesses
who
were
singled
out.
the
device
was
placed
directly
in
front
of
the
criminal
defendant
at
counsel
table,
and
he
was
the
only
person
that
was
screened.
that
is
quite
a
bit
different
from
placing
a
screen
in
front
of
the
witnesses
as
they
were
testifying.
in
fact,
these
children,
your
honor,
could
not
see
this
criminal
defendant,
but
they
could
see
the
judge
sitting
in
a
black
robe
next
to
them
on
the
right
side,
they
could
see
the
twelve
members
of
the
jury
at
their
left
side,
they
could
see
the
media,
the
spectators,
the
bailiff,
the
court
reporter,
defense
counsel,
the
prosecutor,
etcetera.
it
was
only
this
one
person
in
the
courtroom
who,
according
to
the
judge,
needed
this
different
treatment.
mr.
paul
papak
that
would
be
one
means,
justice
scalia,
i
think,
of
lessening
the
prejudicial
impact.
that
doesn't
resolve
the
problem
in
this
particular
context
because
the
court
here
made
absolutely
no
finding
nor
was
there
any
showing
that
the
use
of
a
screen
of
this
sort
served
any
function
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
papak
the
record
shows
that
the
defense...
that
the
county
prosecutor
made
an
application
seven
days
prior
to
trial
for
closed-circuit
television
use
of
the
child's
testimony,
and
that
while
the
children
were
out
of
the
courtroom,
the
defendant
be
separated
from
them
by
a
screen.
and
then
the
court,
on
his
own
motion,
said,
i'll
deny
the
application
for
closed-circuit
television,
but
i'll
instruct
the
bailiff
to
place
a
screen
in
front
of
the
defendant
during
trial,
and
that's
how
the
process
occurred.
mr.
paul
papak
the
county
prosecutor
did,
yes.
mr.
paul
papak
yes,
the
defendant
received
a
copy
of
the
county
attorney's
motion,
and
there
was
a
hearing
held,
at
which
time--
mr.
paul
papak
--yes,
he
objected
vigorously
throughout
this
trial
on
fourth...
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
grounds,
and
he
moved
for
a
mistrial
at
all
appropriate
stages
of
the
proceedings
to
preserve
his--
mr.
paul
papak
--there
is
absolutely,
your
honor,
in
this
record,
no
ground
of
any
sort
given
by
the
prosecutor
or
found
by
the
trial--
mr.
paul
papak
--he
said,
there's
a
new
iowa
statute,
and
i
ask
that
it
be
used.
and
the
statute
says
that
one
device
that
might
be
imposed
by
a
trial
court
would
be
the
use
of
a
screen.
mr.
paul
papak
pardon
me?
mr.
paul
papak
when
a
child
testifies
we
might
use
a
screen
of
this
sort.
he
simply
asked
for
it
based
on
the
statute,
not
a
mandatory
statute,
a
discretionary
statute,
and
the
court
then
imposed
the
screen
on
his
own
without
any
finding
that
there
was
some
need
for
it
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
paul
papak
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
paul
papak
they
could
see
him,
yes.
mr.
paul
papak
there
is
some
question
about
how
clearly,
but
yes,
it
was
designed--
mr.
paul
papak
--that
is
correct.
the
obstruction
was
only
the
two
thirteen
year
old
girls,
as
they
testified,
could
not
see
him.
mr.
paul
papak
yes,
after
the
two
thirteen
year
old
girls
testified
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
trial,
the
screen
was
no
longer
in
place.
mr.
paul
papak
first
two
witnesses
for
the
state.
mr.
paul
papak
yes,
we
would
still
be
here,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
papak
no,
it's
not--
mr.
paul
papak
--no,
it
would
not
solve
it
in
this
particular
instance,
your
honor,
and
i
maintain
that
it
would
not
because
the
requirement
before
the
state
may
infringe
on
fundamental
rights
of
a
criminal
defendant
is
not
only
a
showing
of
necessity,
but
a
careful
tailoring
of
the
infringement.
and
it's
our
position,
your
honor,
that
this
infringement
was
of
such
a
gross
nature
and
there
are
so
many
less
prejudicial
ways
of
protecting
the
child
witness
from--
mr.
paul
papak
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
state
legislature
did
not
make
any
findings
because
the
statute
simply
isn't
mandatory,
nor
does
it
on
its
face
necessarily
apply
just
to
criminal
cases
or
just
to
victims.
nor
does
it
tell
you
which
device
should
be
used.
it
clearly,
i
believe,
vests
discretion
in
the
trial
court
to
determine
in
appropriate
cases
what
the
extent
of
the
state
interest
is
and
how
it
should
best
be
met
by
some
protective
device.
here
we
have
nothing
by
which
we
can
judge
the
exercise
of
that
court's
discretion
in
simply
saying,
i
decide
we're
going
to
use
this
large
and
glaring
screen
in
front
of
the
criminal
defendant
during
the
testimony
of
the
two
key
witnesses
for
the
state.
mr.
paul
papak
i
think
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference,
your
honor,
although
it
wouldn't
change
its
inherent
prejudice.
it
stood
out
to
the
jury
emphasizing
to
them
that
something
was
happening
here
that
was
very
unusual,
that
we
have
a
person
here
who
must
be
so
different
and
dangerous
that
we
have
to
screen
him
from
the
witnesses
as
they
testify.
that's
a
pretty
powerful
statement.
when
we
think
about
estelle
v.
williams,
where
this
court
found
much
difficulty
with
the
idea
of
having
a
criminal
defendant
testify
in
court
with
"harris
county"
along
his
chest
or
on
his
back
or
the
side
of
his
pants,
and
the
inherent
prejudice
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
inferences
of
having
a
defendant
dressed
in
jail
garb,
i
submit
that
this
is
even
a
stronger
prejudicial
inference.
it
suggests
that
this
defendant
is
dangerous
not
in
a
general
sense,
but
the
children,
to
these
two
children
and
the
children
in
the
community
generally.
and
that--
mr.
paul
papak
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
criminal
defendant
seated
at
counsel
table
is
different
from
everyone
else
in
the
courtroom:
he
is
the
person
indicted.
but
this
court
has
taken
great
pains
to
prevent
the
risk
of
somehow
letting
the
jury
make
their
deliberation
based
on
impermissible
factors.
and
that
screen
was
one
great
impermissible
factor.
it
had,
by
its
very
nature,
suggested
inferences
about
this
person
that
made
him
much
different
from
everyone
else
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
paul
papak
that
may
be
one
inference.
mr.
paul
papak
i
think
the
inferences
are
clear,
your
honor.
what
the
jury
is
being
told
is
that
these
children
as
they
are
sitting
in
court
are
traumatized
by
testifying
in
front
of
this
one
man.
and
they
are
traumatized
because
he
in
his
very
presence
here
in
court
has
some
harmful
effect
on
them,
and
that
harmful
effect
was
caused
by
the
fact
that
he
committed
some
acts
against
them
previously
as
their
assailant
in
the
tent
in
the
night
of
august
3,
1985,
and
therefore,
he's
guilty
of
the
crime
charged.
mr.
paul
papak
first
of
all,
your
honor,
that
is
not
what
the
state
law
states,
and
it
is
a
misstatement
of
state
law
if
it's
what
the
judge
said.
mr.
paul
papak
the
judge
said,
provides
for;
he
didn't
say
mandated.
but
assuming
that
the
judge
said
that,
first
of
all,
it
would
be
a
misstatement,
but
more
importantly,
i
think,
is
when
we
look
at
this
court's
reasoning
in
cases
like
estelle
v.
williams.
we're
not
saying
that
you
eliminate
all
risk
and
it
must
only
be
an
inherently
prejudicial
risk
that
we're
concerned
about,
but
we're
concerned
about
the
variety
of
risks
that
influence
the
jury's
deliberations,
and
while
the
jury
might
have
said,
one
inference
that
could
be
drawn
from
this
screen
is
something
about
a
statute,
i
think
the
inevitable
inherently
prejudicial
influence
of
singling
out
this
one
man
for
such
different
treatment
in
a
darkened
courtroom
with
this
big
screen
there
has
another
subtle
effect
on
that
jury's
deliberative
process
that
may,
as
i
suggested,
make
conviction
inevitable.
mr.
paul
papak
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
the
colloquy
prior
to
the
enforcement
of
the
screen.
mr.
paul
papak
there
was
an
argument
that
took
place
prior
to
trial
where--
mr.
paul
papak
--yes,
the
early
part
of
the
appendix,
your
honor.
there
is--
mr.
paul
papak
--that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
papak
absolutely.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
papak
i
don't
think
we
do,
your
honor.
in
other
supreme
court
decisions--
mr.
paul
papak
--that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
papak
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
papak
no,
i
beg
to
differ,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
papak
your
honor,
if
i
may
respond
to
that.
in
estelle
v.
williams
we
had
a
criminal
defendant
seated
in
court
with
jail
issue
clothing,
and
it
said
"harris
county
jail".
now
everyone
in
that
courtroom
including
the
jury
knew
that
he
was
the
charged
defendant.
mr.
paul
papak
that
he
was
in
jail.
mr.
paul
papak
i
think
in
the
same
way
that
jail
clothing
singled
out--
mr.
paul
papak
--all
right.
mr.
paul
papak
convenience.
mr.
paul
papak
your
honor,
i
argue
that
the
need
for
an
interest
must
be
articulated
in
the
record.
the
trial
court...
we
can't
intuit
some
state
interest.
i
presume
that
what
interest
might
be
there
has
something
to
do
with
the
children's
feelings,
but
there
is
no
articulation
of
what
that
interest
is.
and
even
if
there
was
an
articulated
interest,
there
are
certainly
much
clearer,
less
prejudicial
ways
of
meeting
that
interest
without
infringing--
mr.
paul
papak
--yes.
mr.
paul
papak
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
children
witnesses
on
a
case
by
case
basis
should
be
treated
differently.
mr.
paul
papak
because
the
court
hasn't,
within
the
context
of
the
legislation,
made
a
mandatory
determination
that
in
all
cases
children
are
traumatized
and
need
protective
devices.
mr.
paul
papak
that's
correct,
and
that's
what
they
did
in
this
case,
but
how
are
we
capable
of
reviewing
the
discretionary
decision
by
the
trial
court
if
he
doesn't
articulate
the
basis
and
the
factors
that
he
considered
in
making
that
decision.
mr.
paul
papak
this
court
in
the
globe
newspaper
company
case
suggested
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
child
witnesses
and
the
potential
trauma
of
courtroom
testimony,
that
there
is
a
clear
and
easy
method
of
determining
on
a
case
by
case
basis
whether
we
should
infringe
on
first
amendment
rights,
rights
of
access.
and
that
same
statement,
that
same
articulated
purpose
is
equally
applicable
to
infringement
on
the
rights
to
a
fair
trial,
as
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
papak
because
this
court
has
routinely
and
consistently--
mr.
paul
papak
--no,
it
has
not.
not
in
this
context
it
has
not.
the
rights
to
a
fair
trial
encompass,
inevitably,
the
right
to
the
presumption
of
innocence.
and
this
court
has
indicated
in
holbrook
v.
flynn
that
when
you
challenge
a
courtroom
arrangement
as
inherently
prejudicial,
the
important
question
that
must
be
asked
is
whether
there
is
a
risk
that
practice
would
have
some
impermissible
effect
in
the
jury's
deliberations.
the
use
of
a
screen
in
this
case
had
quite
that
same
effect.
it
has
an
impermissible
influence
in
the
jury's
deliberations.
mr.
paul
papak
yes,
by
far,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
papak
i
think
that
in
holbrook
this
court
found
that
there
were
many
inferences,
many
of
which
were
not
incriminatory,
that
could
be
taken
by
the
jury
from
the
use
of
armed
guards
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
paul
papak
that
was
certainly
the
argument--
mr.
paul
papak
--of
the
criminal
defendant
in
that
case.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
this
court
found
that
a
much
broader
range
of
inferences
could
be
drawn
about
other
needs
for
security,
considering
that
there
were
people
who
had
not
been
arrested
as
part
of
the
conspiracy
in
that
case,
and
that
the
inferences
would
not
have
to
be
drawn
relating
only
to
the
defendant
in
that
case.
the
screen
in
this
case,
the
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
this
screen
relate
only
to
mr.
coy
as
he
sat
at
defense
counsel,
because
the
screen
was
placed
only
in
front
of
him
and
shielded
only
his
view
from
that
of
the
witnesses.
it
didn't--
mr.
paul
papak
--in
this
case,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
when--
mr.
paul
papak
--not
in
the
courtroom.
if
the
court
finds
it
necessary
to
screen
a
defendant
from
the
children
because
the
children
are
traumatized,
do
it
outside
the
courtroom.
in
fact,
i
would
submit
that
is
what
the
iowa
statute
calls
for
on
its
face,
but
it
hasn't
been
so
interpreted
by
the
iowa
supreme
court.
mr.
paul
papak
yes,
you're
right,
your
honor.
there
is
an
inevitable
tension
here
in
this
argument
between
the
rights
of
confrontation
and
the
rights
of
due
process.
but
i
think
when
you're
dealing
with
due
process
and
the
presumption
of
innocence,
you're
dealing
with
the
bedrock
of
due
process
rights,
rights
that
should
only
be
infringed
upon
in
the
most
unusual
circumstances.
confrontation
has
always
been
considered
by
this
court
a
more
flexible
trial
right.
mr.
paul
papak
a
videotape
would
not
have
had
the
same
prejudicial
impact.
there
still
would
have
to
be
a
finding--
mr.
paul
papak
--if
there
was
a
showing
that
it
was
necessary,
your
honor,
yes.
it
still
infringes
on
fundamental
rights,
there
still
needs
to
be
some
showing
that
it's
necessary,
not
just
a
class
based
showing
that
somehow
all
children
deserve
protective
devices.
the
case
does
not
support--
mr.
paul
papak
--that
would
be
one
method.
there
are
a
variety
of
methods
of
dealing
with...
that
would
probably
be
more
appropriate
for
close-circuit...
or
videotaped
testimony.
for
closed-circuit
television
some
courts
have
kept
the
defendant
in
the
courtroom
watching
the
monitor
along
with
the
jury.
mr.
paul
papak
no,
i'm
not.
mr.
paul
papak
no,
i'm
not
abandoning
my
sixth
amendment
claim,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
papak
no,
what
i
said,
your
honor,
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
more
flexible,
i
believe,
than
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
terms
of
the
necessity
for
infringement.
there
still
is
a
requirement
of
showing
that
some
essential
state
interest
in
this
case
would
be
served
by
infringing
on
sixth
amendment
rights.
and
yes,
a
screen
in
or
out
of
the
courtroom
would
infringe
upon
a
defendant's
sixth
amendment
rights
to
confront
adverse
witnesses.
i'm
simply
saying,
on
the
balance
it's
easier
and
it's
fairer
to
do
it
outside
the
courtroom
and
infringe
upon
sixth
amendment
rights.
they
are
by
their
very
nature
more
flexible.
mr.
paul
papak
no,
he
did
not.
he
argued
why
he
thought
it
was
inappropriate,
and,
in
fact,
mentioned
during
his
argument
the
fact
that
these
children
never
identified
the
defendant.
and
there
was
some
serious
question
about
the
inference
of
trauma,
but
he
didn't
make
a
specific
request
that
i
want
a
hearing
to
show
on
what
basis
the
court
has
made
its
ruling.
mr.
paul
papak
yes,
i
would.
i
believe
that
is
similar
to
the
question
justice
o'connor
asked.
i
would
be
here
because
i
believe
that
there
are
much
less
intrusive
means
of
meeting
that
same
interest.
that
is,
if
you
screen
the
defendant
outside
the
courtroom,
the
jury
never
has
to
see
it.
and
those
inferences
about
guilt
simply
aren't
transferred
to
them.
and
since
those
opportunities,
those
alternatives
were
readily
available...
in
fact,
the
county
attorney
requested
one
of
those
alternatives.
he
said,
let's
do
it
outside
the
courtroom,
and
the
judge
said
no.
it's
clear
that
less
prejudicial
alternatives
were
easily
within
the
court's
grasp.
mr.
paul
papak
yes.
mr.
paul
papak
yes.
the
court
had
some
trouble
with
that
question,
and
there
is
a
little
colloquy
in
the
record
about
what
happens
if
there
is
an
eyewitness
identification.
do
we
remove
the
screen
or
how
do
we
deal
with
that
problem.
and
he
said,
we'll
wait
for
trial
and
see
what
comes
up.
mr.
paul
papak
i'm
not
sure
of
that
your
honor.
i
believe
as
a
trial
tactic
it
would
be
awfully
dangerous
to
be
saying
let's
remove
this
screen,
now,
thirteen
year
old
girl,
is
this
the
person
who
was
in
your
tent
on
the
night
in
question?
mr.
paul
papak
that's
right,
there
is
no
objection
on
that
behalf.
i
think
he
could
have
asked
the
question--
mr.
paul
papak
--that's
right.
i
believe
the
counsel
would
have
been
capable
to
ask
the
witnesses
whether
they
could
make
an
in-court
identification,
but
i
think
the
trial
tactic--
mr.
paul
papak
--no,
the
defense
counsel
said
the
biggest
trouble
with
this
screen
is
that
the
jury
is
going
to
look
at
it
and
say
that
man
is
obviously
guilty
and
we
ought
to
put
him
someplace
where
he
can
be
screened
permanently--
mr.
paul
papak
--i
can't
speak
for
the
prosecution.
mr.
paul
papak
clearly
claimed
both
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
mr.
paul
papak
he
claimed
on
the
right
of
confrontation
that
there
is
inherent
in
confrontation
the
right
to
a
face
to
face
confrontation
in
most
circumstances.
mr.
paul
papak
with
this
statute
it
is
fourteen
or
under.
mr.
paul
papak
at
fourteen
they're
no
longer
a
child.
so
these
girls
at
thirteen,
the
next
year
would
not
have
met
the
statutory
definition
of
child
sufficient
to
have
a
protective
device
used.
mr.
paul
papak
yes.
mr.
paul
papak
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
i
don't
believe
he
was
at
the
depositions.
mr.
paul
papak
your
honor,
from
start
to
finish,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggests
these
two
girls
were
afraid
of
testifying
in
the
normal
procedure
in
open
court
without
a
screen.
by
this
appeal
appellant
is
not
suggesting
that
protective
devices
used
to
prevent
potential
trauma
to
child
witnesses
are
always
inappropriate.
in
some
circumstances
children
are
certainly
traumatized,
and
if
they
are
traumatized
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
courts
and
the
legislatures
to
provide
them
sufficient
protection.
however,
by
reversing
the
iowa
supreme
court,
this
court
will
not
be,
as
amicus
suggests,
crippling
some
nationwide
effort
to
protect
child
witnesses.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
you
can't
use
appropriate
measures
to
protect
a
child
witness.
all
we
are
asking
is
that
before
they
are
used
they
are
shown
to
be
necessary.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
papak
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
don't
contest
that
some
children
are
traumatized,
and
that
those
that
are
need
protective
devices,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
iowa
statute
that
suggests
that
there
is
some
rebuttable
presumption
that
the
defendant
in
a
particular
case
must
prove
some
lack
of
trauma.
it's
the
responsibility
of
the
state
making
the
application
or
the
court
making
the
order
to
show
some
necessity
in
a
particular
case.
and
further,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
suggests
that
the
least
intrusive
means
of
meeting
a
presumed
interest
is
through
a
screen
in
a
courtroom.
and
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
there
are
clearly
other
less
intrusive
means
if
you
need
to
protect
a
child
witness
from
the
defendant
of
doing
that
outside
the
courtroom
where
the
jury
would
not
be
affected
by
the
presence
of
that
screen
throughout
the
critical
testimony
of
the
child
witnesses--
mr.
paul
papak
why
is
it?
mr.
paul
papak
--well,
the
court
has
historically
discussed
face
to
face
confrontation.
but
i
think
we
can
find
the
answer
in
really
the
background
and
theory
of
confrontation--
mr.
paul
papak
--ohio
v.
roberts.
there
the
court
said
the
truth
finding
function
is
the
central
mission
of
confrontation,
and
as
justice
scalia
suggested--
mr.
paul
papak
--mattox
says
face
to
face.
that
language
has
been
used
historically.
there
is
no
supreme
court
decision
that
directly
says
eyeball
to
eyeball.
mr.
paul
papak
none
in
this
court,
that
is
correct.
there
are
courts
that
go
both
ways
in
the
circuits
and
the
state
courts.
mr.
paul
papak
exactly.
and
further,
that
confrontation,
its
basic
purpose
of
finding
out
the
truth
is
advanced
by
face
to
face,
that
some
people
will,
in
fact,
be
induced
to
be
more
truthful,
to
give
more
honest
and
complete
testimony
by
a
face
to
face
confrontation.
and
so
when
we
can,
we
require
it.
when
we
can't,
when
some
children
can't
tolerate
that,
then
fine,
then
it's
appropriate
then
to
infringe
on
that
right.
simply
not
shown
in
this
case.
all
we
ask
is
that
the
judge
articulate
what
the
necessity
is,
why
the
children
were
so
traumatized
that
they
couldn't
give
complete
or
accurate
testimony
and
that
he
consider
the
alternate
measures
of
protecting
those
child
witnesses
in
the
least
intrusive
method
possible.
thank
you,
your
honor.
