mr.
gorden
e.
allen
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
john
coy
has
quite
simply
failed
to
carry
his
burden
of
proof
on
his
challenge
to
the
iowa
statute.
the
record
he
has
presented
here
today
fails
to
present
a
constitutionally
significant
issue,
for
it
involves
only
the
exercise
of
judicial
discretion,
and
in
this
case
a
legislatively
suggested
exercise,
to
control
the
manner
in
which
the
evidence
was
presented
to
the
jury.
our
position,
succinctly
stated,
is
that
because
the
one
way
mirror
was
not
in
itself
inherently
prejudicial,
it's
limited
use
in
this
case
presented
an
acceptable
risk
and
therefore
did
not
deprive
the
defendant
of
due
process.
secondly,
defendant
offered
no
rebuttal
whatsoever
to
the
rebuttable
presumption
created
by
the
iowa
statute
that
trauma
to
these
children
to
testify
as
witnesses
was
the
norm
and
not
the
exception.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
it
is
the
only
statute
that
i
know
of
that
specifically
provides
for
the
use
of
a
one
way
screen
in
the
courtroom,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
the
statute
itself
was
the
result
of
a
nationwide
effort
by
the
witness
protection
organization
that
went
around.
and
the
reason
that
there
are
so
many
of
these
statutes
coming
up
at
similar
times
is
because
of
this
nationwide
effort.
primarily,
the
use--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
no,
the
closed-circuit
t.v.
was
also
adopted.
it's
in
the
same
statute.
the
one
way
mirror
provision
in
the
statute
was
probably
in
relation
or
response
to
state
v.
strable,
which
was
an
iowa
supreme
court
case
which
occurred
two
years
prior
to
the
passage
of
this
statute,
whereby
the
iowa
supreme
court
upheld
the
action
of
a
judge
in
exercising
his
own
discretion
to
place
a
chalkboard
in
front
of
the
defendant
only
while
child
victims
testified.
similar
to
the
one
way
mirror,
but
with
the
exception
that
the
chalkboards
could
not
be
seen
through
either
way,
as
opposed
to
the
one
way
mirror.
in
this
case,
the
children
could
see
the
defendant.
at
the
trial,
john
coy
at
no
time
presented
any
suggestion
that
these
children
would
not
suffer
trauma
by
testifying.
he
at
no
time
suggested
that
their
testimony
would
be
any
different
if
the
one
way
mirror
were
removed,
and
he
at
no
time
suggested
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient.
he
suggested
that
it
is
not
overwhelming,
but
he
at
no
time
suggested
that
it
would
be
insufficient.
he
simply
not
provided
anything
other
than
a
bald
constitutional
assertion
that
his
rights
had
been
violated--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--i
differ
with
that,
your
honor,
and
for
the
precise
reason
that
you
asked
the
question
of
counsel.
i
believe
that
there
are
several
ways
that
presumption
arises.
it
arises
from
the
findings
of
the
legislature
contained
within
the
statement
of
purpose.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
believe
there
is
no
specific
finding
by
the--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--but
i
believe
there
is
evidence.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
the
specific
factors
that
mr.
papak
suggests
to
this
court
that
should
be
looked
at
can
be
gleaned
from
the
record.
the
judge,
because
he
presided
through
all
of
the
suppression
hearings,
because
he
reviewed
the
depositions,
and
because
he
attended
the
trial
proceedings--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--he
had
seen
the
children
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
but
he
knew
their
ages.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
correct,
but
he
knew
prior
to
that
time
that
he
knew
their
ages,
he
knew
their
psychological
maturity--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--he
knew
they
were
thirteen
years
old
and
that
they
were
relatively
mature
for
thirteen
year
olds.
these
were
not
thirteen
year
olds
who
could
march
into
trial
and
bald-facedly
accuse
anyone
sitting
there.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
he
could
glean
that
from
the
record.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
that's
perfectly
correct.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
it
is
not
mandatory,
and
i
think
that's
the--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--how
do
we
know
that
there
is?
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
the
legislature
made
a
statement
of
purpose
and
a
statement
of
finding,
and
i
believe
that
that
statement
of
purpose,
which
is
contained
within
the
brief,
suggests
that
trauma
is
the
norm.
it
also
is
consistent
with
common
sense.
it
is
consistent
with
the
commentaries
that
we
read
in
this
situation.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
no,
i
would
suggest--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--if
trauma
were
the
norm
and
that
that
is
in
the
absolute
sense
and
it
would
make
a
mandatory
statute,
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
deprive
the
defendant...
who
is
faced
with
a
child
witness
of
extraordinary
capabilities...
of
due
process.
i
would
suggest
that
the
rules
should
be
made
for
the
ordinary
child
and
the
ordinary
defendant
subject
to
then
being
challenged
by
the--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--no,
no,
the
defendant
of
due
process.
a
mandatory
statute,
i
think,
suffers
from
a
violation.
i
think
rebuttable
presumptions
created
within
the
statute
to
allow
the
defendant
to
challenge,
much
like
a
rape
shield
law--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
unlike
pennsylvania
and
rhode
island,
which
specifically
says
that
there
is
a
rebuttable
presumption
in
their
statute,
iowa
does
not
specifically
say
that
there
is
a
rebuttable
presumption.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
believe
the
statute,
by
the
permission
given
from
the
legislature
based
upon
their
findings
to
the
trial
judge,
that
in
itself
creates
rebuttal.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
would
agree.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
no,
i
disagree.
i
think
the
record
shows
that
he
made
a
considered
alternative
judgment.
he
was
first
faced
with
the
option
of
closed-circuit,
which
is
what
the
county
attorney
specifically
requested.
and
the
judge,
based
upon
that
request,
said,
no,
i
don't
think
closed-circuit,
because
it's
too
experimental,
i
don't
think
we
should
do
that.
and
he
went
with...
primarily
because
of
the
sixth
amendment
objection
this
defendant
made,
we're
not
going
to
use
closed-circuit,
we're
going
to
use
the
one
way
mirror.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
don't
agree.
i
think--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--i
have
to
concede
that
his
instruction
reads
a
little
that
way.
i
think--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--i
think
the
instruction
goes
along
with
the
reason
behind
what
the
judge
was
doing.
rather
than
consider
it
mandatory
and
thereby
give
that
instruction,
the
instruction
was
consistent
with
the
multiple
inferences
that
can
be
used
or
gleaned
from
the
use
of
this
one
way
screen.
the
instruction
was
consistent
with
the
inference
from
the
jury
that
it
was
the
witnesses
that
we
were
protecting,
not
the
defendant,
and
the
jury
was
specifically
instructed.
only
the
conduct
of
the
defendant,
which
went
against
that
interest,
when
the
defendant
stood
up
and
objected
to
the
use
of
the
screen,
but
never
asked
that
it
be
removed,
as
you
have
suggested.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
would
say
that
a
mandatory
statute
which
provides
that
the
use
of
a
one
way--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--what
i
think
it
should
be
is
that
there
should
be
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
trauma
is
the
norm.
like
we
do
in
other
instances,
such
as
the
rape
shield
law
or
in
statutory
rape,
what
we
do
is
we
reasonably
put
the
burden
to
object
to
that
on--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--by
the
first
instance,
raising
an
objection
which
this
defendant--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--never
did.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
no,
if
you
read
carefully
what
this
defendant
did,
this
defendant
said
this
is
inherently
prejudicial,
it
violates
my
rights.
but
the
defendant
never
suggested
that
these
children
would
not'
be
traumatized
and
there
was
no
need
for
the
screen.
the
defendant
never
suggested
that
the
screen
or
some
other
alternative
should
be
used.
he
made
an
absolute,
across
the
board
objection.
no
closed-circuit
t.v.,
no
one
way
screen,
it
violates
my
rights.
but
never
suggested
factually
why.
never
raised--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--he
could
have
had
a
hearing,
as
justice
marshall
suggested.
he
could--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--he
did
take
their
depositions.
he
could
have
determined
from
conversations
with
the
parents
either
outside
the
presence
of
the
judge
or
outside
the
presence
of
the
witnesses,
have
these
children
been
in
counseling?
have
they
been
in
psychiatric
care?
have
these
children
expressed
trauma
to
you?
have
the
parents
expressed
trauma?
any
of
those
indicators
which
mr.
papak
says
the
court
should
look
at
could
be
raised
by
the
defendant.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
well
that
in
part,
and
i
want
to
address
that
secondly.
i
don't
believe
that
the
face
to
face
statement
in
mattox
of
1895,
nor
do
i
believe
that
the
confrontation
usage
of
that
word
in
the
sixth
amendment
means
eye
to
eye.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
these
children
did
stand
face
to
face
with
the
defendant
in
front
of
the
jury
so
that
the
jury
could
in
fact
view
their
demeanor
while--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--it's
one
theory.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
this
court
has
historically
said
that
confrontation
includes
the
right
to
have
an
oath,
the
right
to
be
in
front
of
a
jury,
the
right
to
know
the
demeanor,
and
the
right
to
have
unlimited
cross
examination.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
all
of
which
this
defendant
had.
plus
the
defendant
had
the
opportunity
to
view
the
witnesses.
the
defendant
did
get
the
opportunity
to
face
his
accusers.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
but
nevertheless
see
them.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
to
every
criminal
case?
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
believe
it
applies
to
every
case
wherein
the
child
is
under
the
age
of
the
definition
of
child,
which
is
fourteen
and
under
in
iowa.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
no.
what
it
does,
it
gives
the
judge
discretion
to
use
the
screen,
it
offers
him
or
her--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--discretion
to
the
judge.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
he
does
not
specifically
say
that,
but
the
two
hearings
that
he
has
are
contained
in
a
10
through
17
wherein
he
discusses
the
objections--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--no.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
he
did
not
say--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--he
never
said
that
either.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
don't
believe
so,
what
i
believe
he
was
doin--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
believe
he
thinks
he
was
exercising
discretion.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
no.
but
neither
did
he
say
i'm
applying
a
mandatory
statute,
either.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
your
honor,
i
am
here
on
a
record
that
i
think
i
would
be
obliged
to
say
could
be
a
little
better,
as
mr.
papak
would
say.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
it
is
contained
within
a
statute
which
is
in
our
iowa
code
in
the
criminal
provision.
it
applies
to
criminal
cases.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
by
the
terms
of
the
statute
i
believe
it
would.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
believe
it
would.
if
the
child
were
in
the
bank
and
the
gun
were
waved
over
his
or
her
head,
i
believe
it
could.
when
we
get
down
to
the
operational
level
of
what
mr.
papak
and
mr.
coy
are
suggesting
here,
he
is
forced
by
the
lack
of
his
record,
i
believe,
to
come
to
this
court
as
he
has
this
morning
and
said
there
is
never
an
instance
when
a
one
way
mirror
can
be
used
in
the
courtroom.
i
would
suggest
that
under
the
statute
and
under
the
facts
and
under
contemplation,
there
are
instances
that
we
can
conceive
of
when
the
one
way
mirror
could
be
used
in
the
courtroom
consistent
with
due
process
if
there
were
an
essential
evidentiary
showing
that
mr.
papak
suggests
we
need.
so
he
is
now
forced
down
to
the
position
of
saying
i
need
this
hearing.
what
is
this
hearing
going
to
consist
of?
and
that's
really
the
concern
and
the
justification
for
finding
that
the
statute
is
a
rebuttable
presumption.
because
the
hearing
that
mr.
papak
requests
will
be
of
either
two
kinds.
it
will
be
one,
a
pro
forma,
routinized
kind
of
version
where
the
father
comes
in
and
says,
my
daughter
is
traumatized
and
the
judge
says,
fine,
we'll
use
a
one
way
mirror.
or
it
will
be
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
where
we
will
put
these
little
girls
through
three
days
of
psychiatric
counseling.
we
will
then
have
a
battle
of
experts
where
the
defendant
will
bring
a
psychiatrist
and
will
bring
a
psychiatrist--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--that's
conceivable.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
no,
you
don't,
and
our
interest
is
that
you
do
not,
because
if
that
is
the
kind
of
hearing
that
mr.
papak
suggests,
that
will
necessarily
preclude
the
use
of
these
alternative
devices
in
most
cases
in
small
towns
or
small
cities
of
iowa
simply
because
the
expense
to
both
the
victim
and
the
expense
to
the
state
will
limit
it
to
the
most
egregious
kinds
of
cases.
the
limited
kinds
of
cases,
those
that
have
gone
over
the
years
without
prosecution
because
of
the
reluctance
of
these
victims
to
come
to
court
and
testify
without
the
alternative
procedures,
those
kinds
of
cases
will
again
go
under
the
rug.
they
will
again
not
be
prosecuted
either
because
the
county
attorney
doesn't
want
to
put
the
child
through
the
emotional
abuse,
or
else
because
the
child
does
not
herself
or
himself
want
to
come
to
court
to
testify.
if
this
court...
and
i
glean
from
the
questions
today...
wants
to
get
into
the
issue
of
balancing
the
interests
of
the
defendant
for
confrontation
and
for
due
process
in
this
area
versus
the
rights
of
the
child
victim
and
the
state
to
exercise
these
alternative
testimonial
techniques,
i
would
suggest
this
is
not
the
case
to
do
that.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
the
county
attorney
filed
a
formal
motion.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
conceded.
the
county
attorney
on
their
behalf,
we
would
suggest,
filed
the
motion.
the
county
attorney
had
also
sat
through
the
depositions,
the
county
attorney
also,
it
is
presumed
though
it
was
not
ever
in
the
record--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--i
agree
with
that
also,
your
honor.
mr.
papak
and
mr.
coy's
record
would
have
been
better
had
they
made
some
suggestion
that
there
would
have
been
no
trauma,
had
they
made
some
suggestion
that
some
alternative
procedure
other
than
none--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--no
trauma,
your
honor.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
the
short
answer
is
that
for
the
85
year
old
who
is
scared
to
death
to
testify,
i
believe
the
one
way
mirror
is
permissible
but
i
would
differentiate
in
this
regard.
i
think
the
age
differentiation
should
in
the
first
instance
be
made
by
the
legislature.
as
the
appendix
of
the
american
bar
association
brief
says,
they
have
been
all
over
the
board
in
this
statute.
there
are
twelve
to
eighteen
to
whatever.
then
i
think
the
rebuttable
presumption,
that
is
that
trauma
is
the
norm,
should
be
applied
to
those
under
the
age
level
that
the
legislature
has
chosen.
in
this
case
children.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
think
a
55
year
old
could
use
the
screen,
but
at
their
request.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
that
is
not
what
i'm
saying.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
proof,
the
burden
must
then
be
on
the
requester
if
they
are
over
the
age
that
the
legislature
has
chosen.
there
is
no
longer
a
rebuttable
presumption,
and
in
fact--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--then
we
are
back
to
differentiating
again
on
the
definition
of
confrontation,
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
case
that
this
court
has
said
that
eyeballing
someone
or
forcing
a
glare
on
someone
is
contained
within
the
confrontation
clause.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
know
of
several
where
we
have
not,
and
to
use
your
carrying
the
argument
on
further,
can
that
be
used
offensively.
for
instance,
can
the
witness
suggest
that
i
no
longer
want
to
look
at
the
defendant
and
look
to
the
other
side
of
the
courtroom.
can
the
defendant
ask
the
judge
to
force
that
witness
to
look
them
in
the
eye?
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
think
if
the
judge
cannot
compel
that
witness
to
look
at
the
defendant
under
the
sixth
amendment,
then
i
think
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
contain
an
eye
to
eye
confrontation
requirement.
it
contains
a
face
to
face
in
front
of
the
jury,
where
the
jury
has
the
opportunity
to
observe
the
demeanor.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
think
these
witnesses,
this
defendant
were
given
face
to
face
confrontation.
they
were
given
every
essential
element
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
she
didn't
see
his,
but
the
jury
saw
both.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
that
was
raised
by
one
of
the
amicus,
that
a
blind
defendant
would
have
a
tough
time
with
face
to
face
confrontation
if
it
were
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion.
as
i
was
saying,
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
not
the
case
for
this
court
to
make
a
balancing
of
interest
between
the
two
prongs
of
the
interest.
that
is,
the
interest
of
the
defendant
in
confrontation
and
due
process,
and
the
interest
of
the
state
essentially
in
protecting
the
interest
of
these
child
victims
so
that
they
can
come
to
court
and
testify.
i
believe
that
this
case
can
be
decided
simply
because
the
use
of
this
one
way
mirror
is
not
inherently
prejudicial
and
therefore
no
constitutional
issue
presents
itself.
if
it
is
inherently
prejudicial
i
think
the
essential
state
interest
was
shown
by
the
rebuttable
presumption
contained
within
the
statute
which
the
defendant
took
extreme
pains--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--if
there
is
a
problem
at
all--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--so
long
as
the
essential
elements
of
the
sixth
amendment
are
provided,
yes.
trauma
or
not.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
and
that
the
testimony
is
taken
under
oath--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--so
that
in
the
language
of
california
v.
green,
so
that
the
circumstances
closely
approximate
a
trial.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
would
say
that's
correct.
although
the
sixth
amendment
was
utilized
by
this
defendant
at
the
trial
and
in
his
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
as
the
primary
thrust
of
his
argument,
he
now
comes
to
this
court
and
his
primary
thrust
is
due
process,
and
i
would
agree
that
that
is
the
primary
issue
before
us.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
they
did
not,
your
honor,
and
that
leads
right
to
my
next
issue,
which
is
that
if
there
is
a
rebuttable
presumption,
and
if
there
is
evidence--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--they
did
not
identify
him
because
they
could
not.
he
was
masked
during
the
altercation,
and
they
were
not
able
to
identify
him
specifically
either
at
the
time
of
their
depositions
or
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
it
was
circumstantial
evidence--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--i
think
you
have
to
understand--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--trauma,
as
the
commentators
will
tell
you,
and
it's
listed
in
all
the
amicus,
is
really
on
several
levels.
the
first
trauma
is
in
relating
the
incident,
relating
the
event,
and
that
is
trauma
which
is--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--it
is
presumed.
it
is
in
the
common
sense
commentaries.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
circumstantially
identifiable,
yes.
he
was
wearing
his
watch
in
a
certain
way,
he
made
a
statement
when
he
entered
the
tent
which
indicated
that
he
had
been
watching
them
that
afternoon.
yes,
there
was
some
critical
circumstantial
identification.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
and
in
the
identification
of
the
items
which
were
found
in
his
house.
the
third
point
i
would
like
to
suggest
is
that
under
estelle,
this
defendant
had
the
opportunity
and
as
offered
to
him
by
the
judge,
the
reasoned
opportunity,
that
he
could
upon
his
request
have
that
one
way
mirror
removed.
he
stood
up
in
front
of
the
jury
and
called
attention
to
the
jury
to
the
one
way
mirror
contrary
to
the
attempts
that
the
judge
had
made
in
order
to
say
that
this
one
way
mirror
reflects
more
on
the
victims
than
it
does
on
the
defendant.
the
defendant
stood
up
and
said,
oh,
that's
not
true.
it
reflects
upon
me
because
it's
against
my
constitutional
rights.
but
the
defendant
never
then
took
the
next
step
and
said,
after
cross
examining
the
witnesses
as
he
did,
can
you
identify
your
attacker,
and
they
said,
no,
he
was
wearing
a
mask.
then
the
defense
attorney
never
took
that
next
logical
step
and
said,
well,
we'll
remove
the
one
way
mirror.
is
this
gentleman
in
the
courtroom
your
attacker?
and
in
front
of
the
jury
they
would
presumably
testify
the
same
and
say,
no,
he's
not.
he
never
made
that
next
logical
step.
consequently--
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
--the
judge
offered
him
that
opportunity.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
the
judge
said,
if
we
have
an
identification
question,
obviously
we
are
going
to
have
a
problem
under
this
statute,
and
he
in
fact
told
the
jury
that
the
one
way
mirror
might
have
to
be
removed.
mr.
gorden
e.
allen
i
take
that
from
a
reading
of
the
transcript.
on
a
22
i
believe
the
judge
is
offering
the
defense
counsel
the
specific
opportunity
that
under
appropriate
questions,
and
i
would
assume
that
would
be
identity
since
he
reviewed
the
depositions,
that
in
fact
the
one
way
mirror
could
be
removed.
what
the
state
is
asking
for
in
this
case
is
not
to
balance
the
interests
of
due
process
in
favor
of
children
as
opposed
to
this
defendant's
rights.
what
we
are
really
asking
is
that
we
remove
a
vestige
of
discrimination.
the
essential
interests
of
the
state
are
in
obtaining
a
fair
trial
for
all
concerned,
the
defendant
as
well
as
the
witnesses
in
the
state.
and
historically,
child
victims
have
been
unable
to
come
to
testify
in
front
of
their
accusers
either
because
they
are
secondarily
traumatized
or
because
when
we
do
get
them
there,
we
damage
their
credibility
by
placing
them
in
front
of
their
defendants.
what
this
one
way
mirror
does
is
attempt,
pursuant
to
the
legislative
finding
of
a
rebuttable
presumption...
i
see
my
time
is
up
and
i
ask
for
an
affirmance.
