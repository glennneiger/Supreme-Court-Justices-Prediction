justice
scalia
i
think
this
problem
could
be
eliminated
if
in
the
future
the
state
puts
the
screen
in
front
of
the
child
witness
instead
of
in
front
of
the
defendant.
justice
scalia
are
you
abandoning
your
sixth
amendment
claim
now?
justice
scalia
or
are
you
just
addressing
the
due
process
claim?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
it
would
not
offend
the
sixth
amendment
to
put
him
behind
a
one
way
mirror?
justice
scalia
that's
all
that
that
means.
and
therefore
we
leave
it
up
to
the
trial
judge
to
decide
whether
it
should
be
used.
justice
scalia
the
child
witness
of
due
process?
justice
scalia
but
where
is
the
rebuttable
presumption
in
the
statute?
on
page
two
of
your
brief,
is
that
the
one
you
are
talking
about?
justice
scalia
mr.
allen,
let's
talk
about
one
of
the
bases
for
a
categorical
objection
to
it,
and
that's
the
sixth
amendment.
children
witnesses
are
not
new,
nor
are
crimes
against
children
new.
the
same
factor
that
causes
a
child
to
be
traumatized
may
also
prevent
a
child
who
may
have
some
malicious
reason
for
lying
about
a
defendant
from
lying.
it
has
been
believed
that
standing
fact
to
face
with
someone
who
is
about
to
send
you
to
jail
deters
lying,
and
that
certainly
is
what
the
sixth
amendment
seems
to
express.
it
doesn't
say
you
can
use
screens.
it
says
in
all
criminal
prosecutions
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
and
confront
means,
according
to
an
1828
dictionary,
to
stand
face
to
face
in
full
view.
now
what
has
changed
since
then?
i
mean,
did
people
not
know
about
the
tenderness
of
children
when
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted
and
we've
suddenly
discovered
it
now?
justice
scalia
that's
what
confront
means.
justice
scalia
the
whole
purpose
of
it
was
to
prevent
them
from
having
to
look
him
in
the
eye.
now
one
of
the
things
that
could
happen
from
that
is
that
they'll
be
traumatized
or
terrorized
and
for
that
reason
won't
tell
the
truth.
but
another
thing
that
can
happen
is
that
they'll
be
shamed
into
telling
the
truth
rather
than
lying.
that's
certainly
the
theory
of
the
confrontation
clause.
justice
scalia
it's
why
they
use
the
word
confront.
they
could
have
said
right
to
cross
examine
if
that's
all
they
meant.
they
believed
there
was
something
valuable
in
being
able
to
confront
your
accuser,
and
you're
telling
us
that
the
state
can
simply
say,
well,
we've
decided
that
you
don't
have
to
do
that
when
it's
a
child
offense.
you
can
go
to
jail
just
as
well
for
a
child
offense,
it's
just
as
much
a
criminal
prosecution.
i
don't
see--
justice
scalia
--those
were
hard
cases.
that's
extending
the
meaning
of
the
word
confront.
the
easy
cases
confront
means
confronting.
justice
scalia
or
a
55
year
old.
what
about
a
55
year
old?
justice
scalia
so
all
you
have
to
say
is
i
will
be
traumatized
by
confronting
the
person
i
am
accusing,
and
that's
all
it
takes
to
say,
that's
okay
then,
if
you'll
be
traumatized
by
confronting
the
person
you
are
accusing,
you
don't
have
to
confront
them.
that's
not
much
of
a
constitutional
guarantee
it
seems
to
me.
justice
scalia
no,
i
am
assuming
that
i
can
prove
it.
i
will
really
be
traumatized
by
confronting
the
person
i
am
accusing,
the
reason
being
i
am
lying;
i
am
sending
him
to
jail.
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
there's
any
case
we've
decided
that
says
that
any
instance
in
which
a
witness
has
to
be
present
in
a
courtroom,
he
can
be
present
in
that
courtroom
without
confronting,
that
is
being
eye
to
eye
with
the
defendant.
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
we
have
allowed
that?
justice
scalia
probably
not,
but
if
he
looks
away
like
that
the
jury
can
draw
some
conclusions
from
that.
that
jury
can
say,
ah,
this
witness
does
not
want
to
confront
the
person
he
accusing.
justice
scalia
all
right,
i'll
say
face
to
face.
justice
scalia
he
saw
her
face,
she
didn't
see
his
face.
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
the
judge
would
have
gotten
made
if
he
had
tried
to
do
that?
i
mean,
the
judge
ordered
the
thing--
justice
scalia
--the
judge
said
he
could
do
that?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
interpret
that
to
mean
if
we
had
an
identification
question
that
the
defense
itself
chose
to
raise
in
the
fashion
you've
just
said.
do
you
think
that's
what
it
meant?
that
it
was
inviting
the
defense
to
offer
these
young
ladies
to
look
at
the
defendant?
justice
scalia
only
because
the
word
confront
means
face
to
face,
that's
the
only
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case,
coy
versus
iowa
that
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
the
appellant
was
convicted
after
a
jury
trial
of
two
counts
of
lascivious
acts
with
a
child.
at
trial,
the
state
made
a
motion
pursuant
to
an
iowa
statute
to
place
a
screen
in
the
courtroom
during
the
testimony
of
the
two
complaining
witnesses,
both
of
whom
were
13-year-old
girls.
the
trial
court
allowed
the
use
of
the
screen,
which
was
positioned
between
the
appellant
and
the
two
witnesses,
so
as
to
permit
appellant
to
see
the
witnesses
but
blocked
him
from
their
view.
appellant
argued
that
the
screen
violated
the
sixth
amendment's
guaranty
of
a
face
to
face
confrontation
and
violated
due
process.
the
iowa
supreme
court
rejected
these
arguments.
we
reversed
on
confrontation
clause
grounds.
the
right
to
face-to-face
confrontation
has
ancient
roots
although
our
opinions
have
discussed
it
less
frequently
than
other
more
complicated
aspects
of
the
confrontation
clause,
such
as
the
admissibility
of
out-of-courts
statements.
but
both
ancient
and
modern
sources
suggest
that
a
face-to-face
encounter
as
the
words
of
the
clause
suggest
is
an
important
element
of
a
fair
trial
which
serves
the
goal
of
assuring
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process.
today,
we
reaffirmed
the
core
meaning
of
the
confrontation
clause.
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
more
obvious
or
damaging
violation
of
the
confrontation
right
than
the
screen
in
this
case,
which
was
specifically
designed
to
prevent
the
witnesses
from
seeing
the
appellant.
we
do
not
decide
whether
exceptions
to
the
right
exist
since
any
exception
would
require
more
than
the
legislatively
imposed
presumption
of
trauma
that
was
the
sole
justification
for
use
of
the
screen
here.
there
was
no
individualized
finding
that
these
witnesses
needed
special
protection.
we
believe
that
violations
of
the
confrontation
right
may
be
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
rather
than
decide
whether
the
error
here
was
harmless,
we
leave
that
issue
for
the
court
below.
