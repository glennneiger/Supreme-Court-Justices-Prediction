maybe
i
don't
really
understand
your
argument.
you
said
they
didn't
intend
it
to
apply
in
the
philippines
at
all?
justice
stevens
which
was
when?
justice
stevens
and
what
was
going
on
in
the
international
world
at
that
time?
justice
stevens
wasn't
the
main
fighting
by
the
american
forces
at
bataan
at
that
time?
justice
stevens
significant?
i
mean,
wasn't
that
the
part
of
the
war
we
were
most
interested
in
at
that
time?
justice
stevens
well,
who
were
they
rewarding?
justice
stevens
you
think
they
are
the
people
congress
was
thinking
about
in
early
1942?
justice
stevens
let's
not
discuss
it
here.
i
mean,
i
know
some
of
his
reasons
for
this.
justice
stevens
right.
find
out.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.
klonoff.
isn't
it
correct
that
the
'46
act
was
to
make
sure
that
the
philippinos
were
not
eligible
under
the
gi
bill
of
rights?
isn't
that
basically
what
it
was?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
it
would
have
been
very,
very
expensive
to
add
this
additional
group
of
veterans
to
that
entitlement.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
wasn't
that
the
central
purpose
of
it?
justice
stevens
mr.
ungar,
would
you
comment
on
your
opponent's
argument
that
they
could
not
have
been
prejudiced
if
none
of
them
even
knew
about
the
program?
justice
stevens
--these
people
all
served
under
general
mcarthur,
didn't
they?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
is
there
any
evidence
as
to
whether
there
is
any
publicity
in
newspapers,
even
in
army
papers,
you
know,
the
gi...
i
can't
remember
the
name
of
it
now,
but
this
program
wasn't
discussed?
justice
stevens
may,
i
ask
one
other
question
that
goes
to
the
remedy
matter?
do
we
know
how
many
people
have
an
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
case?
justice
stevens
i
am
not
sure
it
is,
when
you
weigh
the
equities
in
a
case
like
this,
i
think
one
might
consider
the
public
consequences.
i
am
not
sure
it
is
totally
irrelevant.
justice
stevens
on
the
remedy
issue.
