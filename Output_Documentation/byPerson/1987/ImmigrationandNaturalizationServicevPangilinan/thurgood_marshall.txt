maybe
you
will
touch
it,
but
why
was
the
'46
law
passed?
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
they
didn't
want
the
philippinos
to
get
it.
justice
marshall
so
it
was
aimed
at
to
get
rid
of
them.
justice
marshall
that
just
in
case
they
might
get
it,
they
are
going
to
make
sure
they
don't
get
it.
that's
what
congress
did.
justice
marshall
let's
not
discuss
senator
hayden,
please.
justice
marshall
you
were
answering
my
question.
justice
marshall
and
i
am
trying
to
tell
you
that
that
won't
help
me.
justice
marshall
well,
didn't
the
government
have
a
duty
to
tell
them?
justice
marshall
so
that
is
like
the
guy
that
was
charged
with
murdering
his
parents
and
pleading
he
was
an
orphan.
that
is
the
argument
that
the
government
is
making.
we
didn't
tell
you
about
it,
so
you
didn't
apply,
so
now
you
are
out.
justice
marshall
they
were
on
a
march
across
the
island.
justice
marshall
they
were
on
a
march
clean
across
the
island.
justice
marshall
no
food,
no
anything.
justice
marshall
to...
one
group
of
people
on
the
basis
of
race
and
denied
them
something,
i
don't
know
what
else
you
can
call
it.
