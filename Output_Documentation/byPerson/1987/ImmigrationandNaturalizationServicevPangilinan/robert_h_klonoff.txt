mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
mr
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
in
ordering
citizenship
for
the
16
respondents,
all
philippine
veterans
of
world
war
two,
under
a
statute
that
expired
in
1946.
we
submit
that
this
court
has
already
answered
that
question
in
1973
in
ins
versus
hibi.
the
court
in
hibi
held
that
the
attorney
general's
action
in
withdrawing
the
vice
consul
from
the
philippines
and
the
government's
failure
to
publicize
the
program
did
not
give
rise
to
an
equitable
basis
for
disregarding
the
december
31st,
1946,
cutoff,
and
as
i
will
explain
during
this
argument,
respondent's
argument
is
nothing
more
than
a
change
of
label.
the
substantive
argument
made
in
this
case
is
identical
to
that
rejected
in
hibi.
we
further
submit
that
hibi
was
correctly
decided
and
that
there
is
no
basis
for
this
court
to
overrule
it.
to
begin
with,
the
relief
ordered
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
is
foreclosed
by
four
naturalization
statutes
in
addition
to
the
1946
cutoff
in
hibi,
and
as
i
will
explain,
those
statutes
prohibit
a
court
from
ordering
citizenship
under
the
expired
and
repealed
1940
act
even
as
to
those
situations
in
which
there
was
a
timely
application
under
the
1940
act
that
was
still
pending
and
had
not
been
ruled
upon,
and
we
submit
that
these
naturalization
statutes
are
dispositive
for
two
reasons.
first,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
fedorenko
and
indeed
as
early
as
the
ginsberg
case,
a
court
has
no
equitable
authority
to
disregard
statutory
requirements
for
citizenship
and
more
generally
the
court
of
appeals'
invocation
of
its
equitable
authority
in
violation
of
statutory
mandate
is
in
fact
an
abuse
of
equitable
authority.
we
submit
it
is
well
established
that
a
court
of
equity
may
not
order
relief
that
is
contrary
to
the
legislative
intent.
in
addition,
it
is
our
position
that
the
underlying
premise
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
false.
in
our
view
the
attorney
general's
actions
were
entirely
lawful
and
were
within
his
discretion
under
the
1940
act,
and
as
i
will
explain,
that
is
true
for
three
reasons.
first,
section
705
of
the
act
left
it
to
the
attorney
general
to
decide
where
to
place
examiners,
when
to
place
them,
and
for
how
long.
in
addition,
the
decision
in
this
case,
the
revocation
of
the
vice
consul's
authority
was
based
on
bona
fide
foreign
policy
concerns,
and
as
this
court
has
made
clear
in
numerous
cases
cited
in
the
government's
briefs,
a
high
degree
of
judicial
deference
must
be
given
in
the
context
of
executive
foreign
policy
decisions,
and
that
applies
a
fortiori,
when
a
court
is
reviewing
those
decisions
four
decades
later.
in
addition,
there
is
added
discretion
in
this
case
because
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
congress
disagreed
with
what
the
attorney
general
did.
in
fact,
as
we
have
explained,
all
of
the
statutory
enactments
since
the
1940
act
only
confirm
that
the
attorney
general
acted
lawfully
in
what
he
did.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
the
language
of
the
'40
act,
you
mean?
absolutely.
first
of
all,
as
we
have
explained
in
our
brief,
it
is
anything
but
clear
whether
that
statute
was
intended
to
apply
to
individuals
who
enlisted
or
were
inducted
in
the
philippines,
and
the
attorney
general
had
to
answer
a
number
of
difficult
issues
before
he
even
determined
that
it
applied
there,
particularly
in
the
context
of
the
philippine
commonwealth
army.
it
is
anything
but
clear
that
congress
intended
to
authorize
the
naturalization
of
some
quarter
of
a
million
individuals
who
are
serving
in
their
own
army.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
we
did,
that's
true,
and
in
fact
that
serves
to
undermine
respondent's
argument
that
there
was
something
invideous
about
what
was
being
done.
that
only
confirms
that
the
decision
was
made
for
legitimate
foreign
policy
reasons,
but
going
beyond
that,
justice
blackmun,
the
statute
as
described
by
the
eight
dissenting
justices
below
is
completely
open
ended.
there
is
no
mandate
that
the
attorney
general
place
an
examiner
in
any
particular
location
or
for
any
particular
period
of
time.
it
is
left
up
to
his
discretion,
and
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
three-month
period
in
which
an
examiner
was
actually
placed
in
the
philippines
before
his
authority
was
revoked
compares
quite
favorably
and
is
perhaps
comparable
to
the
post
to
post
rotation
system
that
was
employed
elsewhere
in
the
world.
so
ultimately
it
may
be
in
fact
that
these
respondents
and
others
similarly
situated
had
as
much
access
to
an
examiner
as
soldiers
elsewhere
in
the
world,
so
we
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
the
statute
that
compelled
the
attorney
general
to
leave
an
examiner
there,
and
indeed
we
submit
it
was
entirely
within
his
discretion
to
do
what
he
did.
and
again,
i
would
point
out
that
the
subsequent
congressional
statutes
only
confirm
that.
we
have
in
1946,
while
the
statute
was
still
in
effect,
we
have
congress
passing
a
statute
indicating
that
membership
in
the
philippine
commonwealth
army
does
not
constitute
membership
in
the
united
states
armed
forces.
that
directly
contradicts
the
ninth
circuit's
assumption
that
the
plain
reading
of
the
statute
compelled
the
attorney
general
to
apply
the
program
in
the
philippines.
we
have
the
1948
statute
which
made
clear
that
enlisting
or
being
inducted
in
the
philippines
does
not
entitled
the
individual
to
citizenship
unless
that
person
is
later
a
lawful,
permanent
resident
of
the
united
states.
the
same
provision
in
1952.
there
is
simply
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
this
program
was
intended
to
apply
in
the
philippines,
and
we
challenged
respondents
to
cite
anything
in
the
legislative
history
either
to
show
that
the
program
was
initially
intended
to
apply
in
the
philippines
or
some
recognition
on
the
part
of
congress
that
the
attorney
general
had
erred
or
engaged
in
misconduct,
and
they
have
not
cited
any,
so
we
would
submit
in
light
of
that
complete
absence
of
anything
by
congress
to
contradict
what
the
attorney
general
did
and
given
the
foreign
policy
concerns
that
were
the
basis
for
the
decision,
it
would
be
particularly
inappropriate
to
second
guess
that
decision
40
years
later.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
we
are
saying
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--1942.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
we
would
concede
that
there
were
battles--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--there
was
significant
fighting
there,
but
one--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that
is
correct,
but
it
is
simply...
there
is
no
reflection
in
the
legislative
history
that
we
have
found
or
that
respondents
have
found
that
congress
was
acting
to
reward
those
individuals
the
250,000
people.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
they
were
rewarding,
there
were
some
80,000
people
who
were
naturalized
around
the
world,
in
iceland,
england,
members
of
the--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
think
so.
we
think
the
fact
that
in
1946
congress
specifically
said
that
membership
in
the
commonwealth
army
does
not
constitute
membership
in
the
armed
forces
for
purposes
of
government
benefits
would
support
it.
all
we
are
saying,
we
don't
know
what
congress
intended.
congress
wasn't
clear.
they
were
clear
in
the
world
war
one
statute.
they
specifically
mentioned
the
philippines.
they
weren't
clear
in
the
world
war
two
statute.
all
we
are
saying
is,
you
have
a
statute
that
on
its
face
has
a
1946
cutoff,
and
as
this
court
said
in
hibi,
the
public
policy
underlying
that
cutoff
is
clear
and
must
be
recognized,
and
that
has
to
be
balanced
against
what
at
most
is
an
uncertain
congressional
intent
as
to
whether
the
statute
was
meant
to
apply
to
the
philippines
at
all.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
then
we
still
think
for
several
reasons
that
that
is
not
dispositive.
in
fact,
let
me
take
it
at
several
different
levels.
the
second
circuit
in
olegario,
the
reasoning
of
which
we
agree
with
on
the
statute,
assumed
for
purposes
of
the
decision
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
apply
to
the
philippines,
but
what
the
court
said
was,
that
is
only
the
beginning
of
the
question,
because
the
president
in
revoking
his
authority
had
discretion
to
do
so
under
section
705
of
the
statute,
and
more
particularly
as
a
result
of
the
foreign
affairs
concerns
that
were
the
basis
for
the
revocation.
so
it
would
be
our
submission
that
even
if
congress
had
been
clear
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
apply
to
the
philippines,
that
in
light
of
the
foreign
policy
issue
that
faced
the
executive
and
in
light
of
the
very
reasonable
and
tailored
response
of
the
attonrey
general,
that
was
within
his
authority
under
the
1940
act.
furthermore,
even
if
the
conduct
is
considered
to
be
erroneous,
in
other
words,
if
the
attorney
general
had
acted
under
a
misperception,
we
think
that
hibi
still
forecloses
the
claim
because
it
is
not
enough
to
simply
err.
as
the
court
indicated,
there
was
no
affirmative
misconduct
there
and
accordingly
no
basis
for
ordering
equitable
relief
four
decades
later,
so
we
think
that
hibi
would
be
dispositive
regardless
of
whether
or
not
this
court
agrees
with
us
on
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
bring
that
out
about
whether
the
program
was
intended
to
apply
in
the
philippines
only
to
reinforce
our
position
that
this
court
has
to
weigh
on
the
one
hand
a
clear
congressional
intent
expressed
over
the
years
from
the
1940
statute
itself
through
1961
and
repeated
statutes
of
the
public
policy
that
the
'40
act
expires,
it
is
revoked,
and
that
all
petitions
have
to
be
considered
under
current
law,
and
the
court
has
to
balance
that
against
a
rather
vague,
at
best,
intention
on
the
part
of
congress.
and
as
we
indicated,
if
congress
was
so
concerned
about
the
individuals
in
the
commonwealth
army
obtaining
citizenship
it
would
have
been
astonishing
for
congress
to
come
along
in
1948
and
explicitly
made
clear
that
enlistment
or
induction
in
the
philippines
does
not
qualify
someone
for
citizenship
unless
he
later
becomes
a
lawful
permanent
resident.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that
is
true
but
it
is
very
close
in
time,
justice
scalia.
in
fact,
the
cutoff
date,
1946
cutoff
date
was
established
in
1945
as
an
amendment,
and
then
we
are
talking
about
a
congress
three
years
later.
we
are
actually
talking
about
a
congress
one
year
later,
because
the
recision
act
which
said
that
the
statute,
the
commonwealth
army
is
not
to
be
treated
as
the
united
states
army,
that
was
1946,
one
year
later,
and
i
would
note
furthermore,
as
explained
to
the
court
in
olegario,
the
congress
in
1945
that
passed
the
cutoff
amendment,
during
the
course
of
its
deliberations
senator
hayden
made
the
remark
that
it
was
his
understanding
of
current
law
that
philippine
veterans
or
soldiers
were
not
eligible
for
citizenship
unless
they
later
came
to
the
united
states,
and
as
the
olegario
court
points
out,
no
one
in
congress
expressed
any
disagreement
with
that
observation.
again,
our
analysis
our
our
submission
in
no
way
depends
on
that,
as
i
have
explained
to
justice
o'connor.
we
just
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
the
ninth
circuit,
which
based
its
opinion
on
what
it
called
"the
expressed
intent
of
congress"
is
not
expressed
at
all.
it
is
at
most
implied,
and
it
really
requires
a
good
degree
of
reading
to--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--the
'46
law?
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
in
part
it
was
passed,
justice
marshall,
because
of
a
concern
by
congress
about
various
kinds
of
monetary
benefits
going
to--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--they
didn't
want
the--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
what
the
concern
was
is
that
the
congress
hadn't
really
focused
on
the
fact
that--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--but
what
congress
was
focusing
on,
justice
marshall,
was
the
fact
that
their
enactments
were
premised
on
membership
in
the
united
states
armed
forces.
the
commonwealth
became...
was
brought
into
the
service
of
the
united
states
army
only
by
executive
order,
and
it
really
hadn't
been
focused
by
congress
on
the
fact
that
you
were
bringing
in
a
quarter
of
a
million
people
who
were
therefore
going
to
be
eligible
to
all
these
benefits.
but
let
me
say,
justice
marshall,
one
thing
that
is
extremely
interesting
is
that
in
the
course
of
passing
the
1946
legislation,
actually
it
was
a
statement
afterwards
and
we
have
quoted
it
at
length
in
our
brief,
senator
hayden,
who
was
one
of
the
co-sponsors
of
that
bill,
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
intents
behind
it
was
to
make
clear
that
members
of
the
commonwealth
army
were
not
entitled
to
citizenship,
that
those
people
were
fighting
primarily
to
serve
the
independence
of
their
own
country,
and
that
in
fact
it
would
be
no
service
to
these
individuals
to
bring
them
here
where
they
were--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--let's
not--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--i
am
not
sure
what
your
honor
is--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--i
was
responding--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--yes,
i
was
responding
as
to
what
was
behind--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--let
me--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that
was
in
large
part,
but
what
i
am
saying
is--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
the
statute
was
worded
in
a
very
open-ended
fashion.
it
said
that
subject
to--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that
was,
and
all
i
am
pointing
out
is
that
a
later
remark
about
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute
being
to
make
clear
that
for
purposes
of
the
citizenship
program
members
of
the
commonwealth
army
were
not
to
be
treated
as
in
the
armed
forces.
if
i
could
turn
back
just
briefly
to
the
hibi
point,
the
veteran
in
hibi
made
essentially
a
two-part
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court.
his
argument
was,
number
one,
that
the
attorney
general
deliberately
violated
the
1940
act,
and
that
number
two,
present
day
citizenship
was
therefore
appropriate
as
an
equitable
remedy.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
in
hibi
adopted
this
two-part
analysis,
and
we
submit
that
if
the
case
caption
of
the
name
and
the
references
to
parties
were
removed,
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
in
hibi
is
virtually
a
carbon
copy
of
its
current
opinion.
there
is
really
no
analytical
distinction.
the
court
first
said
that
the
attorney
general
violated
the
will
of
congress,
and
secondly
that
citizenship
was
appropriate
as
an
equitable
remedy.
now,
this
court
summarily
reversed
and
held
that
the
conduct
of
the
attorney
general
at
issue
was
not
affirmative
misconduct
and
therefore
could
not
have
stopped
the
enforcement
of
the
statutory
cutoff
date,
and
in
the
conclusion
of
its
opinion
the
court
stated
in
no
uncertain
terms
the
respondent's
effort
to
claim
citizenship
under
a
statute
which
by
its
terms
had
expired
more
than
20
years
before
he
filed
his
lawsuit
must
therefore
fail.
and
now
we
have
somebody
coming
in
with
the
same
identical
arguments,
the
same
two-part
analysis,
and
arguing
for
citizenship,
and
we
think
that
hibi
is
controlling,
and
we
agree
with
the
dissenting
judges
below
that
there
is
simply
no
meaningful
difference
between
saying
that
the
government
is
equitably
estopped
from
raising
a
statutory
cutoff
and
disregarding
the
cutoff
as
a
matter
of
equity.
furthermore,
we
would
submit
hibi
is
not
only
dispositive
of
the
statutory
arguments,
but
is
dispositive
of
the
constitutional
arguments.
now,
let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
issues,
so
it
simply
makes
no
sense
to
distinguish
hibi
on
the
around
that
these
parties
are
raising
constitutional
issues.
that
would
only
be
a
distinction
as
a
way
of
defending
the
court
of
appeals
case
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
fact
decided
the
case
on
constitutional
grounds.
but
in
any
event,
as
we
point
out,
the
constitutional
argument
is
in
essence
the
same
argument
that
was
made
before,
simply
new
labels
being
attached
to
old
argument,
and
the
policies
in
hibi
about
why
a
court
should
not
on
that
occasion
20
years
later
now
40
years
later
ignore
the
public
policy
of
a
cutoff
apply
equally
well
whether
you
label
the
claim
equitable
estoppel,
equitable
relief,
or
due
process.
and
in
fact
numerous
of
this
court's
decisions
dealing
with
equitable
estoppel
would
confirm
that.
for
example,
in
immigration
and
naturalization
service
versus
miranda,
where
the
court
held
that
the
government
was
not
equitably
estopped
because
of
its
delay
in
processing
an
application
for
adjustment
of
status,
it
would
be
rather
odd
if
the
alien
in
that
case
could
come
back
in
and
say
that
that
delay
violated
his
constitutional
rights
and
he
is
therefore
entitled
to
adjustment
of
status.
based
on
the
same
allegation,
the
same
thing
would
be
true
in
schleicker
versus
hansen.
the
erroneous
advice
leading
an
individual
not
to
get
benefits
for
a
period
of
time,
the
court
held
there
was
no
equitable
estoppel
there,
it
would
be
rather
odd
if
the
person
could
come
right
back
in,
put
the
label
due
process
on,
and
suddenly
be
eligible
for
all
these...
for
all
these
benefits.
if
i
could,
if
there
are
no
questions
on
the
hibi
point,
turn
to
the
equitable
issues,
and
it
is
important
to
emphasize
in
all
of
these
statutes
that
i
am
discussing
the
reason
we
are
discussing
them
is
because
this
court
in
numerous
of
its
foreign
affairs
decisions
has
looked
to
the
congressional
response,
congressional
acquiescence
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
attorney
general
did
something
that
violated
the
will
of
congress.
and
as
we
have
pointed
out,
you
have
an
array
of
statutes,
most
compellingly
the
'48
statute,
which
states
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
even
individuals
who
had
applied
under
the
1940
act
and
who
had
their
applications
pending,
that
those
applications
were
to
be
decided
under
the
1948
act.
now,
if
congress
was
willing
to
see
individuals
who
had
made
timely
applications
have
their
rights
or
benefits,
rather,
dealt
with
under
the
'48
statute,
it
could
not
have
intended
that
individuals
such
as
those
here
would
be
eligible
for
citizenship
40
years
later.
it
is
important
to
emphasize--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that
is
exactly
our
submission.
that
is
clear
from
the
face
of
the
1948
act,
that
individuals
who
had
applied
under
section
701
before
the
december
31st
cutoff,
those
applications
were
to
be
treated
not
under
the
'40
act
but
under
the
'48
act.
and
our
submission
is
that
it
is
an
a
fortiori.
if
individuals
who
had
met
the
cutoff
had
their
benefits
cut
off
under
the
'40
act,
it
could
not
be
that
individuals
such
as
respondent
who,
number
one,
didn't
apply
during
the
period,
and
number
two,
didn't
even
know
about
overseas
naturalization,
congress
could
not
have
intended
that
those
individuals
be
eligible
40
years
later.
it
is
important
to
emphasize
we
are
dealing
with
what
has
now
come
to
be
called
category
two.
these
phrases
were
coined
by
a
district
judge
in
the
'68
philippinos
case.
category
two
are
individuals
who
made
no
efforts
whatsoever
prior
to
the
cutoff
to
obtain
citizenship,
and
in
fact
it
is
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
not
a
single
one
of
the
16
respondents
even
knew
about
the
program,
and
in
fact
one
of
our
submissions
here
in
this
court
is,
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
the
respondents
can
claim
they
were
injured
when
they
didn't
even
know
about
the
program.
had
there
been
an
examiner
there,
we
do
not
understand
how
they
can
claim
injury
when
they
did
not
even
know
about
the
program.
the
subsequent
statutes
are
as
clear
as
the
1948
act.
the
'52
act
specifically
lists
the
territories
that
are
included
within
the
concept
of
the
united
states
and
its
territories,
and
it
excludes
the
philippine
islands.
so
once
again,
and
again,
just
like
the
'48
statute,
that
applies
to
applications
that
were
pending
under
the
1948
act.
congress
explicitly
stated
in
the
'52
statute
that
applications
under
the
'40
act
that
were
pending
but
had
not
been
ruled
upon
were
to
be
decided
under
the
'52
statute,
and
again
you
have
the
same
a
fortiori.
if
the
pending
applications
were
to
be
treated
under
the
'52
act,
it
could
not
be
the
case
that
congress
anticipated
applications
that
had
not
even
been
filed
until
decades
later
should
be
treated
under
the
'40
act
rather
than
the
'52
act.
and
then
perhaps
the
most
compelling
statute
of
all
in
some
sense
because
it
is
in
essence
an
overall
umbrella
of
these
other
statutes
is
the
1961
statute,
where
congress
said
that
all
applications
for
naturalization
have
to
be
considered
under
the
1952
act.
that
was
section
310(e)
of
the
'52
act
in
1961.
so,
the
court
of
appeals
in
order
to
order
equitable
relief
in
this
case
not
only
had
to
ignore
the
1940
act,
the
'46
cutoff,
but
it
had
to
ignore
all
of
these
other
statutes
as
well,
and
we
share
the
concern
of
the
dissenting
judges
below
that
there
is
something
wrong
if
a
court
just
by
putting
on
a
hat
that
says
equity
can
order
a
remedy
that
violates
a
whole
series
of
statutes
that
could
not
be
more
explicit.
let
me
turn
to
the
issue
now
of
whether
in
fact
the
attorney
general
violated
the
1940
act.
the
ninth
circuit
had
little
problem
concluding
there
was
such
a
violation,
but
as
the
dissenting
judges
noted
and
as
the
court
in
olegario
noted,
the
statute
gave
the
attorney
general
considerable
discretion
in
deciding
where
to
place
the
examiners.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
said
examiners
had
to
be
placed
at
specific
locations
for
specific
periods
of
time.
you
then
have
the
added
layer
of
the
foreign
policy
decision
that
was
involved
here,
and
the
contemporaneous
historical
documents
are
quite
clear
as
to
what
happened.
the
attorney
general
initially
made
a
decision
even
though
the
statute
did
not
require
it
after
consultation
with
his
subordinates
that
he
would
apply
the
statute
in
the
philippines
under
a
generous
and
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
it
was
only
when
the
foreign
policy
issue
arose
that
the
decision
was
made
to
revoke
the
examiner.
there
is
a
document
which
is
quoted
in
a
number
of
the
court
decisions
in
this
area
from
september
1945
to
attorney
general
tom
clark
indicating
that
the
philippine
government
had
expressed
its
concern
that
if
the
naturalization
program
were
carried
out,
as
many
as
a
quarter
of
a
million
people
the
best
young
men
for
the
philippines,
would
suddenly
leave
that
newly
emerging
country
for
the
united
states,
and
you
would
have
a
country
that
would
not
have
a
nucleus
of
its
own,
an
army
of
its
own.
and
it
was
only
upon
obtaining
this
memorandum
that
the
attorney
general
initialed
the
memorandum
and
made
the
decision
that
he
would
revoke
the
naturalization
authority.
after
congress
made
clear
that
being
in
the
commonwealth
army
did
not
qualify
an
individual
for
the
benefits
of
being
in
the
united
states
armed
forces,
the
attorney
general
again
reinstituted
the
authority
of
the
naturalization
examiner
in
the
philippines,
because
at
that
point
since
it
was
then
being
applied
to
members
of
the
scouts
rather
than
the
commonwealth,
which
was
a
much
smaller
number,
the
concerns
that
had
initially
been
raised
by
the
philippine
government
were
no
longer
a
problem.
so
we
would
urge
the
court
then
to
follow
the
reasoning
of
the
decision
in
olegario
and
to
hold
that
the
attorney
general's
conduct
was
permissible
under
the
'40
act,
and
if
i
could
just
briefly
touch
upon
the
court's
miranda
decision,
since
that
was
relied
upon
quite
heavily
by
the
court
of
appeals,
we
strongly
agree
with
the
dissenting
judges
below
that
the
court
could
not
have
intended
in
a
decision
that
did
not
raise
any
question
involving
philippine
veterans
to
in
effect
decide
that
citizenship
was
now
going
to
be
available
for
thousands
of
philippine
veterans.
it
was
simply
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
and
we
would
urge
the
court
that,
but
we
have
offered
an
explanation
of
the
language
in
miranda.
the
court
in
miranda
in
saying
that
the
action
was
error
was
referring
not
only
to
hibi
but
also
to
the
court's
montana
decision,
and
a
reading
of
the
montana
decision
leaves
grave
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
error.
that
was
a
situation
the
court
may
recall
where
a
consular
official
indicated
to
a
woman
that
she
should
not
travel
in
her
condition.
she
was
pregnant
at
the
time.
and
there
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
that
was
inappropriate
advice.
but
it
is
anything
but
clear,
as
the
court
itself
indicated
in
miranda,
whether
this
was
error
or
was
simply
well-intended
advice
that
she
shouldn't
travel
in
that
condition.
so
montana
itself
confirms
that
the
court
did
not
mean
to
necessarily
declare
that
there
was
error,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
point
being
made
in
miranda
was
simply
to
emphasize
that
in
miranda
you
simply
had
delay
or
negligence
whereas
there
were
deliberate
acts
involved
in
hibi.
so
we
don't
think
this
court
intended
in
a
context
where
the
issue
is
not
even
before
it
to
resolve
these
difficult
questions.
finally,
i
would
not
briefly
one
of
our
submissions
that
in
this
kind
of
situation
where
you
are
awarding
equitable
relief
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
believe
that
once
it
had
decided
there
was
a
wrong
it
had
to
find
a
remedy,
and
we
submit
that
that
is
simply
an
erroneous
understanding
of
the
role
of
an
equitable
court.
a
court
in
effect
has
to
balance
the
equities,
and
one
thing
that
could
not
be
stronger
against
the
position
of
the
respondents
is
that
they
did
not
assert
their
claimed
entitlement
to
citizenship
until
40
years
later,
or
30
years
later
at
the
least.
and
as
we
have
explained,
individuals
who
knew
about
the
program
back
in
the
1940s
are
guilty
of
laches
for
waiting
so
long,
and
the
individuals
who
did
not
even
learn
about
the
program
until
the
1970s
or
'80s
can
hardly
claim
that
they
were
prejudiced
or
injured
as
a
result
of
the
decision.
in
fact,
we
have
cited
some
law
review
articles
that
analyze
this
court's
hibi
decision
as
at
bottom
a
balancing
of
the
equities.
but
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
was
of
the
view
that
once
it
decided
there
was
a
wrong
it
didn't
have
to
balance
the
equities,
so
we
would
urge
the
court
if
it
reaches
that
issue,
and
we
submit
there
is
no
reason
to
get
to
the
issue
of
remedies,
but
if
the
court
reaches
that
issue,
we
urge
the
court
to
hold
that
at
this
late
date,
given
the
potential
disruption
of
the
immigration
system,
the
delay
in
asserting
the
claimed
of
citizenship,
and
so
forth,
that
there
is
no
basis
for
equitable
relief.
i
would
reserve
the
balance
for
rebuttal,
unless
there
are
any
questions.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
very
briefly,
on
the
hibi
point
i
would
just
refer
the
court
to
page
3
of
our
reply
brief,
in
which
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
arguments
made
in
hibi
by
the
respondent
in
the
memorandum
in
opposition,
which
was
the
pleading
before
the
court
since
it
was
summarily
reversed
are
identical
to
the
arguments
made
here,
the
characterization
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that
is
a
very
good
question.
the
decision
on
category
one
was
made
as
a
policy
matter,
and
quite
frankly,
that
is
a
policy
decision
that,
depending
on
how
the
court
analyzes
the
issue,
is
going
to
have
to
be
reconsidered
in
the
future.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
the
executive
doesn't
rule
on
naturalization.
the
executive
makes
a
recommendation,
and
all
that
was
happening
is
that
the
executive
wasn't
affirmatively
opposing
naturalization.
it
is
a
decision
that
is
made
by
the
courts.
thank
you.
