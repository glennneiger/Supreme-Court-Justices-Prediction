chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
86-1992,
immigration
and
naturalization
service
against
antolin
punsalan
pangilinan,
and
consolidated
case.
mr.
klonoff,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
klonoff,
then
it
is
your
submission
that
the
1948
act
cut
off
the
claims
of
some
people
who
had
made
application
to
the
earlier
act
and
would
have
qualified
under
the
earlier
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klonoff.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
ungar.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
a
part
of
hibi?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
not
only
seemed
to
conclude,
it
did
conclude.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
our
opinion
in
hibi
concludes
as
the
solicitor
general
has
reminded
us
saying
that
the
respondent's
claim
must
fail,
and
yet
the
ninth
circuit
has
gone
back
and
said,
no,
it
need
not
fail.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
is
open
to
a
lower
court
to
recanvass
facts
that
have
been
characterized
by
this
court
in
a
particular
way?
chief
justice
rehnquist
were
there
new
facts
presented
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
had
not
been
presented
earlier?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
ordinarily
when
the
ninth
circuit
analyzes
a
case
one
way
and
we
analyze
it
another,
we
prevail.
but
apparently
that
isn't
the
case
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
the
solicitor
general
correct
or
incorrect
in
saying
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
pass
on
these
constitutional
issues?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
mr.
ungar,
congress
itself
changed
its
mind
in
1948,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
is
not
as
if
this
had
always
been
on
the
books.
this
was
a
statute
that
was
in
effect
for
a
very
short
time
and
then
congress,
which
is
the
source
of
authority,
changed
its
mind.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
if
the
solicitor
general
is
correct,
i
would
think
maybe
that
isn't
right
because
i
understood
him
to
say
that
those
whose
applications
were
pending
and
qualified,
some
of
them
were
cut
off
under
the
1948
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ungar.
mr.
klonoff,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klonoff.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-1992,
immigration
and
naturalization
service
versus
pangilinan
and
the
companion
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
