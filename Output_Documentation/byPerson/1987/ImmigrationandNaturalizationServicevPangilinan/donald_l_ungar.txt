mr.
donald
l.
ungar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
three
things
i
hope
you
will
do
when
you
decide
these
cases.
the
first
of
these
is
to
tell
the
government
you
really
meant
it
when
you
said
the
attorney
general's
error
was
clear
when
he
made
it
impossible
for
qualified
world
war
two
veterans
to
be
naturalized
in
the
philippines
in
1945.
the
second
is
to
take
a
closer
look
at
just
what
the
error
was,
and
to
recognize
that
it
was
more
than
the
ordinary
neglect
or
oversight
that
the
majority
opinion
described
it
as
in
the
hibi
case.
rather,
it
was
an
intentional,
deliberate
decision
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
to
keep
the
offer
of
citizenship
away
from
qualified
veterans.
it
was
a
decision,
in
other
words,
to
prevent
the
enforcement
of
the
law
as
congress
had
written
it.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i
am
asking
you
to
take
another
look
at
the
facts
in
hibi.
i
think
in
hibi
the
majority
opinion
looked
at
the
facts
in
a
more
traditional
equitable
estoppel
context.
in
a
typical
equitable
estoppel
argument
against
the
government
an
applicant
is
suggesting
that
he
was
misled
to
his
indetriment
by
some
erroneous
advice
that
a
government
official
may
have
given
him.
mr.
hibi
couldn't
make
that
kind
of
argument
because
there
was
no
misleading
of
him.
no
immigration
officer
or
federal
official
went
out
to
him
and
said
to
him
erroneously
that
you
are
not
eligible
for
naturalization,
and
so
the
court
or
the
majority
in
that
case
seemed
to
conclude
that
because
there
was
no
affirmative
act
which
misled
mr.
hibi,
that
there
was
no
estoppel.
it
could
give
rise
to
no
estoppel.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
that
is
not
the
way
the
majority
characterized
what
happened.
the
majority
characterized
what
happened
as
a
mere
failure
to
publicize
the
availability
of
this
wartime
naturalization
law
and
a
mere
failure
to
station
an
examiner
in
the
philippines
during
all
of
the
time
that
veterans
like
mr.
hibi
were
eligible
to
apply.
but
it
wasn't
just
a
mere
failure,
and
if
the
majority
was
saying
a
mere
failure
does
not
give
rise
to
an
estoppel,
it
certainly
did
not
consider
the
issue
of
whether
a
deliberate
decision
to
disregard
the
law
would
give
rise
to
estoppel.
in
that
sense,
i
think
you
can
look
back
at
hibi
and
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
in
hibi
the
majority
said
it
must
fail
because
there
was
nothing
more
than
neglect,
and
it
was
obvious
from
the
opinion
that
the
majority
considered
it
nothing
but
a
matter
of
neglect
because
the
hibi
decision
was
based
upon
the
old
utah
power
and
light
case.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i
don't
think
this
court
characterized
that
in
the
way
that
the
court
below
saw
it.
the
court
below
saw
it
as
a
deliberate
violation
of
a
statutory
obligation
by
the
attorney
general.
this
court
didn't--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--no,
the
facts
are
identical.
mr.
hibi's
facts
and
the
facts
presented
by
the
respondent
is
identical.
but
the
analysis
that
was
applied
by
this
court
was
not
the
analysis
provided
by
the
court
below
and
it
was
not
inconsistent
with--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--well,
i
think
it
is
important
how
perception
of
what
happened
determines
how
one
analyzes
the
case,
and
the
majority
in
hibi
perceived
the
case
as
nothing
but
mere
neglect,
whereas
the
true
facts
were
much
more
than
mere
neglect.
in
any
event,
i
hope
you
won't
consider
hibi
to
be
dispositive,
because
the
veterans
in
this
case
have
raised
a
different
legal
issue.
that
is,
they
have
raised
the
due
process
issues
that
mr.
hibi
did
not
raise
and
were
not
considered
in
his
particular
case.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
no,
he
is
correct.
the
ningh
circuit
did
not
pass
on
it,
and
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
briefs,
we
believe
that
this
court
may
pass
on
those
issues
if
it
so
chooses,
or
remand
it
for
consideration
of
those
issues
if
it
comes
to
that
conclusion.
let
me
turn
first
to
the
question
of
error.
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
the
attorney
general
did
have
the
authority
to
halt
the
naturalization
program
in
the
philippines
in
1945.
i
think
the
place
to
start
first
of
all
is
with
the
fact
that
what
congress
had
done
here
was
to
enact
a
statute
in
the
exercise
of
its
exclusive
naturalization
authority.
congress
and
only
congress
can
determine
who
is
to
be
naturalized.
that
is
not
the
function
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
and
in
this
particular
place,
if
we
look
at
the
language
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
the
means
that
congress
chose
to
implement
that
statute,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
attorney
general
did
have
the
obligation
to
carry
out
that
law
by
naturalizing
any
qualified
veteran.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear.
it
says
that
any
qualified
veteran
may
be
naturalized.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
provide
naturalization
for
qualified
veterans
in
exchange
for
the
service
that
they
provided
to
the
united
states
armed
forces
during
the
war.
and
the
means
to
make
sure
that
soldiers
and
sailors
overseas
would
have
the
opportunity
to
apply,
the
statute
section
705
specifically
called
upon
the
attorney
general
and
the
commissioner
of
immigration
to
take
whatever
action
is
appropriate
to
make
appropriate
rules
and
regulations
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
the
law
into
effect,
not
to
frustrate
the
purpose
of
the
law.
that
is
the
mandate
that
congress
provided
in
the
1942
amendments
to
the
1940
act,
and
i
think
it
is
clear
from
what
happened
that
during
the
war
itself,
from
1942
onward
throughout
the
war
the
attorney
general
recognized
that
that
was
his
obligation.
the
commissioner
of
immigration
sent
representatives
all
over
the
world
during
the
war
to
naturalize
qualified
veterans.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i
think
it
is
more
than
just--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--well,
he
looked
upon
it
that
way,
and
i
think
certainly
the
language
of
the
statute
said
he
is
authorized
to
do
this,
but
in
the
context
of
the
statute,
the
purpose
being
to
naturalize
veterans
overseas,
congress
certainly
made
that
intention
clear,
and
since
they
set
up
this
mechanism
for
doing
it,
it
seems
to
me
it
was
apparent
that
he
had
to
follow
and
implement
the
statute
by
following
that
mechanism.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
right.
well,
i
think--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
saying
that
he
didn't
have
to
send
an
examiner
to
a
particular
country
because
he
didn't
have
the
fund
or
he
didn't
have
the
manpower
or
because
of
the
exigencies
of
war
he
couldn't
send
people
to
certain
parts
of
the
world.
i
think
there
is
a
big
difference
between
that
and
a
situation
where
he
says
i
have
the
manpower,
there
is
a
vice
consul
on
the
scene,
the
law
says
that
these
people
are
entitled
to
be
naturalized,
but
i
am
going
to
take
it
away
from
them
to
prevent
the
offer
from
being
accepted.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
yes.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
there
are
two
segments
of
the
armed
forces
insofar
as
it
applied
to
philippinos
who
were
residing
in
the
philippines.
one
was
a
unit
called
the
philippine
scouts,
which
was
a
direct
part
of
the
united
states
army
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
some
were
and
some
weren't.
some
were
also
in
the
philippines
commonwealth
army,
which
was
an
army
raised
by
the
commonwealth
of
the
philippines
prior
to
its
independence.
now,
what
happened
was
that
under
the
philippines
independence
act
of
1934,
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
given
the
authority
in
time
of
emergency
to
take
the
armed
forces
of
the
philippines
commonwealth
and
make
it
a
part
of
the
united
states
armed
forces,
which
he
did.
president
roosevelt
in
1941
issued
an
executive
order
taking
the
philippines
commonwealth
army
and
bringing
it
into
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
they
all
served
under
the
same
flag.
they
all
wore
the
same
uniform
once
the
war
started.
and
they
were
all
considered
part
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states,
and
i
think
it
has
been
suggested
here
in
1946
the
purpose
of
the
1946
act
was
to
save
money.
congress
realized
at
that
point
perhaps
that
it
would
cost
them
a
lot
of
money
to
provide
gi
bill
and
other
benefits
for
the
commonwealth
soldiers
among
others,
and
so
it
wrote
into
the
law
that
legislation
which
barred
them
from
being
considered
for
certain
monetary
benefits
that
other
soldiers
and
sailers
were
entitled
to.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
the
argument
was
made
that
it
was
unlawful
for
him
to
withdraw
the
officer--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--for
the
avowed
purpose
of
preventing
people
who
were
entitled
to
be
naturalized,
for
the
avowed
purpose
of
preventing
them
from
being
naturalized.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
that
was
the
ninth
circuit's...
in
addition
the
ninth
circuit's--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--well,
you
can
also
remedy
it--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--i
am
sorry,
i
missed
the
last--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
estoppel
and
equitable
discretion
perhaps
on
the
one
hand
and
due
process
arguments
on
the
other.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i
think
there
is
a
difference
there,
and
i
think
that
is
an
important
difference,
because
if
you
are
considering
the
due
process
violation,
this
issue
of
affirmative
misconduct
is
irrelevant.
one
doesn't
have
to
find
affirmative
misconduct
on
the
part
of
federal
officials
in
order
to
find
a
constitutional
violation.
the
error
is
enough.
i
think
it
is
important
in
that
respect.
and
also
the
due
process
argument
is
also
important
because
of
subsequent
post-war
legislation,
because
the
congress
cannot
legislate
away,
so
to
speak,
a
constitutional
injury
to
these
people.
so
that
would
also
be
important
for
that
reason.
getting
back
to
the
issue
of
error,
whether
the
attorney
general
had
the
authority
to
withdraw
the
examiner
from
the
philippines
during
that
time,
the
government
says,
first
of
all,
that
perhaps
the
philippinos
who
were
serving
there
were
not
entitled
to
naturalization
in
the
first
place.
i
think
what
mr.
klonoff
is
forgetting
is
that
the
attorney
general
made
that
determination
in
1945
that
philippinos,
like
these
respondents,
were
eligible
for
naturalization.
that
is
not
really
an
issue
before
the
court
any
more.
they
were
determined
to
be
within
the
scope
of
this
particular
statute.
as
to
the
foreign
affairs
authority,
it
is
true
that
the
executive
department
has
great
authority
in
the
field
of
foreign
affairs,
but
here
we
have
a
statute
under
which
congress,
exercising
its
naturalization
powers,
said
these
people
shall
be
naturalized.
there
is
no
case
which
says
that
the
executive
branch
can
take
action
in
the
field
of
foreign
affairs,
despite
an
act
of
congress
which
provides
an
opposite
intent.
i
don't
think
the
foreign
affairs
powers
really
goes
that
far.
as
to
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
discuss
specifically
the
issue
of
what
it
would
want
to
do
in
the
event
of
objections
by
the
philippines
government
as
part
of
the
foreign
affairs
issue,
so
to
speak,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
take
away
the
offer
of
citizenship
from
philippinos
in
the
philippines
for
such
reasons,
because
when
congress
enacted
this
law
it
made
it
specifically
applicable
to
persons
who
were
residing
in
the
united
states
or
its
territories
or
possessions,
and
of
course
at
that
time
the
philippines
was
the
largest
of
the
united
states'
possessions.
they
used
language
in
the
law
that
a
person
who
served
in
the
armed
forces
and
who
was
not
a
citizen,
rather
than
using
the
term
"alien"
is
significant
that
congress
meant
to
include
philippinos,
because
philippinos
were
then
by
far
the
largest
number
of
people
who
were
neither
citizens
nor
aliens,
but
non-citizen
nationals.
the
use
of
that
language
certainly
indicates
an
intent
to
include
philippinos
who
were
residing
in
the
philippines
within
the
scope
of
this
statute.
as
justice
stevens
has
pointed
out,
this
law
was
enacted
at
the
very
moment
that
the
battles
of
bataan
and
coregedor
were
making
headlines
all
across
the
country.
congress
must
have
known
that
the
philippines
was
going
to
become
independent
at
some
future
date.
it
must
have
known
that
president
roosevelt
had
brought
all
of
these
people
into
the
army.
to
suggest
that
congress
did
not
want
these
particular
people
to
be
naturalized
seems
to
be
inconsistent
with
all
those
particular
ideas,
and
that
if
congress
really
had
wanted
to
exclude
those
philippinos
under
these
circumstances
it
would
have
made
that
intention
explicit.
it
certainly
didn't
do
that.
i
think
i
have
touched
on
the
idea
already
about
whether
the
attorney
general
had
an
implied
delegation
of
authority
to
withhold
the
benefits
of
the
naturalization
law
from
people
in
the
philippines.
section
705,
as
i
have
indicated,
did
delegate
a
certain
amount
of
authority
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
commissioner
of
immigration
to
place
representatives
in
various
parts
of
the
world.
as
i
pointed
out
before,
there
is
a
big
difference
between
the
authority
to
do
that,
the
obvious
discretion
that
he
would
have
to
have
in
light
of
scheduling
and
manpower
problems
and
what
was
going
on
in
the
war,
there
is
a
big
difference
between
that
and
deliberately
removing
an
examiner
who
is
already
there
for
the
purpose,
the
express
purpose
of
taking
away
the
offer
of
citizenship
that
congress
had
made
to
them.
it
seems
to
me
if
the
attorney
general
felt
that
there
were
reasons
not
to
grant
citizenship
to
philippinos
in
the
philippines
in
1945
it
was
for
congress
to
make
that
decision,
because
only
congress
can
determine
who
is
to
be
naturalized,
and
that
when
the
attorney
general
made
his
decision,
he
really
crossed
the
constitutional
line
between
his
role
as
a
person
who
is
supposed
to
faithfully
execute
the
law
with
congress's
role
to
make
the
laws,
particularly
in
the
area
of
naturalization.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
the
government
suggests
that
none
of
these
people
were
injured
because
we
don't
know
whether
they
ever
would
have
found
out
about
their
opportunity
to
apply
had
the
examiner
remained
on
duty
in
the
philippines
during
that
particular
period
of
time.
well,
of
course,
none
of
us
will
ever
know
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
sort
of
argument
is
putting
these
respondents
in
an
impossible
position.
it
is
the
government
that
is
responsible
for
that.
the
government
is
saying,
how
can
you
tell
us
that
you
would
have
heard
about
this
law
when
we,
the
government,
have
taken
away
the
only
way,
the
means
that
you
could
have
applied.
the
only
way
that
you
could
have
learned
presumably
would
be
if
we
had
left
an
examiner
there.
it
is
possible
that
word
of
mouth
would
have
reached
these
people.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i
think
so,
and
i
think
there
was
an
obligation
to
do
that.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
yes,
i
think
it
is
significant
there,
too,
because
other
soldiers
elsewhere
were
notified
of
the
opportunity
of
applying.
there
was
a
war
department
circular
that
called
upon--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--it
is
a
hard
argument
under
that...
i
agree
with
you
in
that
respect.
i
think
in
all
fairness
it
is
difficult,
too,
because...
for
another
reason,
and
that
is
that
these
people,
these
men
who
were
in
the
philippine
scouts
and
the
philippine
army,
and
they
were
captured
after
the
fall
of
bataan
and
coregedor
and
spent
time
in
prison
camps
were
stranded
in
the
philippine
islands
during
the
war.
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
get
notice
to
them,
and
when
they
came
back--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
they
certainly
were.
so
i
think
that
underscores
the
injustice
of
what
was
done
here.
they
were
people
that
put
their
lives
on
the
line
for
the
united
states
at
a
very
critical
time
in
the
war.
they
were
promised
american
citizenship
in
exchange
for
that
service,
and
when
the
war
ended,
for
reasons
which
the
attorney
general
seemed
to
think
were
okay,
we
simply
said,
well,
it
is
too
bad,
the
war
is
over,
we
will
forget
about
your
opportunity
to
apply
for
naturalization.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
that
is
true.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
first
of
all,
that
was
another
congress,
and
secondly,
this
was
1948,
and
i
think
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
that
congress
knew
that
the
attorney
general
had
violated
his
duty
under
the
1942
act.
i
think
the
1948
act,
the
enactment
of
that
bill,
one
can
presuppose
that
congress
assumed
that
everybody
who
was
covered
under
the
1942
act
would
have
had
a
fair
chance
to
apply,
and
here
the
war
is--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--that
is
true,
and
it
is
interesting
also,
your
honor,
that
mr.
klonoff
refers
to
the
category
two
veterans
and
category
one
veterans.
category
one
veterans
are
those
who
learned
about
the
opportunity
to
apply
during
the
war
and
made
an
effort
to
apply
but
were
told
that
they
were
ineligible
to
do
so.
now,
the
government
is
acquiescing
in
their
naturalization
even
today
on
the
theory
that
they
made
an
effort
to
do
it
and
there
was
some
sort
of...
as
an
equitable
matter
they
should
be
naturalized
today.
if
one
followed
mr.
klonoff's
argument
to
its
logical
conclusion
they
shouldn't
be
naturalized
either
because
the
1948
act
would
have
cut
them
off,
but
i
think
the
main
point
is
that
1948
was
two
years
after
philippine
independence.
congress
could
have
looked
at
the
situation
and
said,
look,
we
gave
you
people
an
opportunity
to
apply
for
naturalization
during
the
war
and
right
after
the
war.
you
had
a
fair
chance
to
do
that,
and
if
you
chose
not
to
accept
american
citizenship,
we
are
just
not
going
to
extend
it
any
more.
there
is
no
indication
here
that
congress
knew
that
these
people
were
deprived
of
their
opportunity
to
apply
in
1945
and
1946.
had
they
known
that
maybe
there
would
have
been
a
different
result,
but
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
suggest
that
because
there
was
an
enactment
in
1948,
that
congress
really
meant
to
cut
off
the
rights
of
someone
who
was
injured
by
governmental
conduct
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
one
could
have
made
that
interpretation,
i
suppose,
and
if
they
had
made
that
interpretation
i
guess
we
wouldn't
be
here
today,
but
the
fact
is
that
that
was
the
interpretation
that
the
attorney
general
made
in
1945.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
that
question
has
never
really--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--i
think
that
is
also
true.
that
is
a
separate
issue.
only
philippinos
as
a
class
were
discriminated
against
in
the
operation
of
this
particular
law.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i
don't
think
that
is
true
at
all.
they
were
barred
from
becoming
citizens
because
they
were
philippinos,
and
we
didn't
want
them
coming
to
the
united
states
for
whatever
reason
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
yes,
they
did.
just
to
get
back
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
the
injury,
again,
i
think
it
is
really
asking
the
respondents
to
prove
the
impossible
to
say
that
they
would
have
heard
about
this
law
had
the
examiner
remained
on
duty
in
the
philippines
in
1945.
and
i
hope
the
outcome
of
this
case
is
not
going
to
turn
on
that
particular
question.
we
will
never
know
what
could
have
happened
if
the
examiner
had
stayed
there.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is...
the
reason
we
don't
know
is
the
government's
own
error,
and
that
shouldn't
prejudice
these
respondents
in
that
particular
light,
and
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
remember
in
that
context
that
these
veterans
were
cut
off
during
the
war
from
all
opportunity
to
learn
about
the
law.
all
this
happened
as
the
war
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
they
were
scattered
throughout
the
philippines.
there
was
only
one
examiner
in
manila
who
was
doing
this
and
there
was
no
official
notice
to
these
people
as
there
was
to
others,
and
the
fact
is
that
some
people
did
find
out
about
it.
the
category
one
people
that
we
have
referred
to
did
find
out
about
their
opportunity,
and
they
must
have
found
out
about
it
through
word
of
mouth,
so
it
seems
to
me
logical
to
assume
that
had
the
offer
remained
there
there
certainly
was
a
better
chance
that
these
people
would
have
found
out
about
their
opportunity
to
be
naturalized
and
would
have
taken
whatever
steps
were
appropriate
to
apply.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
i
could
find
to
show
that
these
people
in
the
philippines
were
notified
about
their
opportunity
to
apply
for
naturalization.
mr.
klonoff
refers
to
the
fedorenko
and
the
ginsberg
cases
as
suggesting
that
a
court
is
not
allowed
to
look
beyond
what
the
statute
provides
with
respect
to
naturalization.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
difference
between
those
cases
in
determining...
there
is
a
difference,
in
other
words,
in
determining
whether
an
individual
is
eligible
for
naturalization,
in
which
case
obviously
a
court
has
to
look
at
the
naturalization
statute
as
congress
provided.
what
happened
here
was
different.
it
wasn't
a
question
of
whether
these
philippino
veterans
were
eligible
for
naturalization.
rather,
it
was
a
decision
to
bar
them
from
even
applying.
i
think
there
is
a
big
difference
which
allows
the
court
to
provide
a
remedy
whether
on
a
constitutional
or
an
equitable
basis.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
no,
we
really
don't
know.
i
think
the
government
has
been
arguing
large
numbers
from
the
very
beginning
in
the
hibi
case
when
they
filed
their
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
hibi
case...
he
was
a
scout,
by
the
way,
in
the
much
smaller
unit,
and
at
that
time
the
government
was
suggesting
that
as
many
as
30,000
philippino
scouts
were
still
alive
and
would
apply
and
80,000
dependents
would
apply,
and
that
is
only
the
scouts.
now,
here
it
is
20
years
later,
since...
the
reason
that
many
of
these
people
found
out
about
the
law
in
later
years
was
the
hibi
litigation
and
the
'68
veteran
litigation.
all
this
has
been
going
on
for
20
years,
and
at
most
we
have
a
couple
of
thousand
people
who
have
come
forward
now
to
make
application
so
it
seems
to
me
the
numbers
involved
are
very
small.
i
don't
know
what
the
exact
numbers
are.
there
are
certain
petitions
pending
in
various
courts
around
the
country.
but
clearly
they
are
small
in
terms
of
overall
immigration.
we
invite
as
many
as
800,000
people
a
year
into
the
country
legally.
it
is
small
in
terms
of
the
two
million
or
so
people
we
have
invited
to
come
in
and
apply
for
amnesty.
common
sense
tells
us
that
it
has
to
be
a
small
number
because
these
are
an
aging
group
of
people.
i
mean,
in
this
particular
case
the
youngest
man
is
64.
the
oldest
is
in
his
eighties.
there
aren't
that
many
more
who
are
going
to
be
able
to
come
here.
i
think
one
has
to
start
out
with--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--well,
i
think
it
is
relevant
perhaps
in
the
sense
of
balance.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
that
is
the
point
i
was
going
to
make.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
it
may
be
relevant
in
a
balancing
of
equities
situation.
what
i
am
trying
to
suggest
is
the
weight
to
that
particular
argument
ought
to
be
very
small
because
there
can't
be
very
many
who
are
going
to
benefit--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--the
children
are
not
going
to
benefit.
these
are
men
in
their
sixties,
seventies,
and
eighties.
the
only
kinds
of
children
who
would
benefit
under
our
immigration
laws
would
be
unmarried
minor
children
who
would
come
here
to
the
united
states
outside
of
the
quota
system.
the
present
quota
system
from
the
philippines
is
so
oversubscribed
that
any
adult
child
of
an
amerncan
citizen
has
to
wait
ten
years
or
more
to
come
here.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
they
would
have
been
born
in
this
country
and
they
would
be
natural
born
citizens.
that
is
true.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
persons
who
were
born
in
the
united
states?
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
your--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--that
is
probably
true.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
it
is
another
step
forward,
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
much
harder
argument.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
they
could
only
come
to
this
country--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--at
that
time,
if
they
were
still
young
enough
and
these
people
were
naturalized
they
could
have
come.
the
fact
is,
if
you
are
weighing
the
equities
and
balancing
the
equities,
you
have
to
do
it
as
of
today,
and
as
of
today
there
aren't
going
to
be
very
many
children
of
these
veterans,
if
any,
who
are
going
to
come
to
the
united
states
under--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--i
think
the
law
may
have
expired,
but
for
the
reasons
i
have
indicated,
the
court
has
the
authority
to
remedy
the
wrong
that
was
done
to
these
people
either
on
constitutional
or
equitable
principles.
i
think
the
bottom
line
in
this
case,
i
have
always
felt,
is
that
congress
made
a
promise
to
these
people
back
in
1942
that
they
could
become
american
citizens
if
they
served
in
the
armed
forces.
these
people
did
serve
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
they
were
entitled
under
the
law
to
be
naturalized.
the
attorney
general
did
not
give
them
the
authority
to...
did
not
allow
them
to
do
that.
he
violated
his
authority
under
that
law,
which
was
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress,
and
since
he
had
no
authority
to
do
that,
i
think
the
court
has
the
authority
to
provide
a
remedy
despite
the
many
considerations
that
mr.
klonoff
has
referred
to
in
terms
of
subsequent
legislation,
and
so
on.
thank
you
very
much.
