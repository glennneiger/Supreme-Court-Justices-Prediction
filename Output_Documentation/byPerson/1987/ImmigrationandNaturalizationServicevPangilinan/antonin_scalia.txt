justice
scalia
that
is
a
different
congress,
of
course.
you
are
are
talking
as
though
congress
is
one
congress
out
there.
justice
scalia
or
that
he
was
authorized
to
do
it.
justice
scalia
all
that
that
necessarily
acknowledged
was
that
he
had
the
authority
to
do
it,
not
that
he
was
obliged
to
do
it.
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
necessarily
prove
that
he
was
obliged
to
do
it.
justice
scalia
other
things
being
equal.
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
why,
if
he
didn't
have
enough
money
to
send
them
to
all
countries,
he
would
have
to
select
some
countries,
and
what
he
is
saying
here
is
that
there
is
another
factor
that
came
into
account,
some
foreign
affairs
factor.
justice
scalia
but
the
statute
was
not
mandatory.
it
didn't
say,
he
shall
station
these
examiners.
it
just
authorized
it.
justice
scalia
it
was
argued
in
hibi,
was
it
not,
although
it
doesn't
appear
in
our
opinion,
the
argument
was
made
that
it
was
unlawful
for
the
attorney
general
not
to
station
these
officers
in
the
philippines?
indeed,
that--
justice
scalia
--right.
justice
scalia
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
that
time
around.
justice
scalia
so
it
is
not
a
new
legal
point
you
are
bringing
up.
you
just
want
to
recharacterize
it
as
not
estoppel
now
but
what,
we
can
remedy
it
by
our
equitable
powers.
justice
scalia
is
there
any
new
legal
issue
that
is
before
us
in
this
case?
justice
scalia
is
there
any
new
legal
issue
that
is
before
us
in
this
case
other
than
the
difference
between
estoppel
and
equitable
discretion?
justice
scalia
the
due
process
argument.
right,
i
agree.
justice
scalia
of
course,
the
whole
thing
might
have
been
a
mistake
from
the
beginning.
we
don't
really
know
for
sure
that
when
congress
said
the
military
or
naval
forces
of
the
united
states
it
meant
to
include
the
commonwealth
army.
justice
scalia
i
understand,
but
it
makes
the
injustice,
if
that
is
what
it
was,
seem
a
little
less
acute
when
it
was
a
dicey
question
whether
that
language
would
have
been
interpreted
to
include
philippinos
in
any
event.
justice
scalia
yoi
can't
make
it...
paint
it
over.
well,
it
wouldn't
be
on
the
basis
of
race.
it
would
be
on
the
basis
of
what
army
they
served
in.
whether
they
served
in
the
army
of
the
united
states
or
an
army
that
was
not
an
army.
that
is
how
the
statute--
justice
scalia
i
assume
that
is
irrelevant
to
our
decision,
of
course.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
whether
we
will
provide
justice
to
a
lot
of
people
or
just
a
few
people.
justice
scalia
you
are
going
to
tell
them
you
can
leave
the
philippines
so
long
as
you
leave
your
family
there?
justice
scalia
mr.
klonoff,
on
the
equitable
discretion
point,
how
did
these
class
one
veterans
who
had
applied
but
not
yet
been
naturalized,
how
did
they
get
in
if
there
is
no
equitable
power
to
ignore
the
subsequent
repealer
of
the
law?
justice
scalia
you
mean
the
executive
has
that
equitable
power
but
the
courts
don't?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
comes
to
us
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
during
world
war
ii
in
march
of
1942,
congress
amended
the
immigration
laws
to
make
american
citizenship
more
readily
available
to
aliens
who
serve
honorably
in
the
united
states
armed
forces.
in
addition
to
liberalizing
the
citizenship
requirements
for
such
aliens,
the
act
authorized
the
commissioner
of
immigration
and
naturalization
to
receive
their
naturalization
petitions
and
to
naturalize
them
outside
the
united
states.
under
this
provision,
in
august
1945,
the
american
vice
consul
in
manila
was
designated
to
naturalize
aliens.
nobody
had
been
designated
for
the
philippines
before
them
because
they
were
under
japanese
control.
the
philippine
government,
however,
expressed
its
concern
that
a
mass
migration
of
newly
naturalized
veterans
would
drain
the
soon-to-be
independent
country's
manpower.
and
so
that
authority
was
revoked
for
a
nine-month
period
between
october
1945
and
august
1946.
the
respondents
in
this
case
would
have
been
eligible
for
citizenship
under
the
provisions
of
the
1942
legislation
if
they
had
filed
naturalization
applications
before
the
act
expired
on
december
31,
1946,
but
they
did
not
do
so.
more
than
30
years
later,
the
respondents
initiated
this
litigation
by
petitioning
for
naturalization
claiming
that
the
nine-month
absence
of
a
naturalization
officer
violated
the
legislation
and
deprived
them
of
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
their
claims
were
rejected
by
the
naturalization
officers
and
the
district
courts
but
were
accepted
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
we
reversed.
since
respondents
have
no
current
statutory
right
to
citizenship
under
the
expired
provisions
of
the
1942
legislation,
the
court's
lack
authority
to
grant
petitions
for
naturalization.
that
result
cannot
be
achieved
on
the
basis
of
the
court's
powers
to
grant
equitable
relief.
equity
courts
can
no
more
disregard
statutory
provisions
than
can
a
court
of
law.
section
1421(d)
of
title
viii
of
the
united
states
code
provides
that
a
person
may
be
naturalized
“in
the
manner
and
under
the
conditions
prescribed
in
this
subchapter
and
not
otherwise”.
the
subchapter
no
longer
includes
the
provisions
of
the
1942
legislation.
we
also
hold
that
there
is
no
merit
to
respondent's
contention
that
the
revocation
of
the
vice
consul's
naturalization
authority
deprived
them
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
assuming
that
they
are
entitled
to
claim,
the
benefit
of
those
constitutional
provisions,
they
were
not
entitled
to
individualize
notice
of
any
statutory
rights
or
to
the
continuous
presence
of
a
naturalization
officer
in
the
philippines
from
october
1945
until
july
1946.
the
court's
opinion
is
unanimous
except
that
justice
blackmun
concurs
in
the
result
and
justice
kennedy
took
no
part.
