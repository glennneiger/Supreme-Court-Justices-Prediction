mr.
don
d.
buchwald
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
convictions
of
wall
street
journal
reporter
foster
winans
and
his
two
co-defendants,
should
be
reversed
because
what
these
defendants
did
is
not
securities
fraud
and
it
is
not
mail
or
wire
fraud.
by
way
of
overview
with
respect
to
the
securities
laws
first,
there
are
two
principal
reasons
that
we
have
as
to
why
the
securities
fraud
conviction
should
be
reversed.
first,
that
securities
fraud
can
only
be
committed
on
investors
or
persons
who
participate
in
securities
transactions.
it
is
not
something
that
can
be
committed
upon
a
newspaper
or
upon
a
private
employer
who
has
not
participated
in
the
securities
transaction
and
who
has
no
interest
in
the
purchase,
sale,
or
value
of
the
securities
involved.
and
second,
that
a
private
company
work
rule,
such
as
the
wall
street
journal's
does
not
have
the
force
of
criminal
law,
particularly
whereas
here
it
is
presented
to
employees
as
going
beyond
the
requirements
of
the
law.
this
case
involves
a
private
wrong
by
foster
wynans
upon
the
wall
street
journal
which,
if
it
became
public,
could
adversely
affect
the
newspaper's
reputation.
this
kind
of
wrong,
we
submit,
however
one
may
view
it,
is
simply
not
what
was
intended
to
be
covered
by
the
securities
laws,
even
if
the
wrong
is
cast
in
terms
of
the
misappropriation
of
information.
the
securities
laws
were
designed
to
protect
market
participants
from
fraud,
and
not
employers
form
potential
damage
to
their
reputations.
just
as
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
statutes
protect
persons
from
fraud
in
their
capacities
as
property
holders,
the
laws
proscribing
securities
fraud
protect
persons
from
fraud
in
their
capacity
as
investors
or
participants
in
market
transactions.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
there
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
we
would
submit
that
that
would
not
suffice,
that
there
must
be
fraud
upon
the
market
participants.
here,
justice
stevens,
what
we
have
as
foster
winans'
trading
on
what
he
perceives
will
likely
be
the
market
impact
of
the
accurate
articles
that
he
is
writing
and
that,
we
submit,
is
no
different
than
a
situation
where
salomon
bros.
may
trade
knowing
that
their
very
well-known
economist
partner,
murray
kaufman
is
going
to
be
making
a
speech
in
the
afternoon,
in
which
he
gives
his
opinion
that
interest
rates
are
going
down,
and
salomon
bros.,
in
anticipation
of
the
market
impact
of
that
speech,
buys
into
sensitive
stocks
in
the
morning.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
because
a
market
participant
must
be
defrauded
in
that
capacity
as
a
market
participant,
and
that
that
is
the
reach
of
the
securities
laws.
it
is
not
sufficient
that
there
simply
be
a
fraud,
assuming
that
winans'
conduct
here
vis-a-vis
the
wall
street
journal
is
a
fraud,
which
is
a
premise
we
dispute.
it
is
not
sufficient
that
there
be
a
fraud
upon
a
third
party,
which
who
himself,
has
no
interest
in
the
purchase,
sale
or
value
of
securities
and
is
not
participating
in
a
securities
transaction;
and
then
that
fraud
somehow
relates
or
impacts
upon--
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
--it
would
still
not
be
a
fraud
on
the
market
participants
unless
there
was
a
pre-existing
relationship
between
mr.
winans
in
this
case
and
the
people
selling
him
the
stock
that
he
buys
in
advance
of
the
column,
which
gave
rise
to
a
duty
to
disclose
that
information.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
well,
in
the
cosmic
sense,
that
i
think
that
the
securities
laws
presume
in
the
discloser's
staying...
obligation
exists
even
when
you
have
open
market
transactions.
and
the
existence
of
that
relationship
occurs
where
you
have
a
pre-existing
relationship
to
the
corporation
whose
securities
are
being
traded;
there,
as
in
essence,
say
a
fiduciary
or
trustee
of
the
corporation's
information,
the
securities
laws
presume
that
you
are
a
trustee
or
fiduciary
of
the
information
of
all
of
the
shareholders.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
that
that
would
not
be
in
the
securities
laws
because
there
is
no...
that
is
really
the
situation
of
tiorello,
where
you
have
information
that
emanates
from
the
acquiring
company
side,
and
you
then
use
that
information
in
the...
to
buy
stock
of
the
company
to
be
purchased...
the
target
company.
and
while
that
tiorello
kind
of
situation
is
now
covered
by
rule
14e-3,
the
10b
analysis,
it
would
not
apply
because
there
is
no
pre-existing
relationship
that
gives
rise
to
the
duty
to
disclose.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
i
think
that
there
clearly
was
an
ethical
breach
by
mr.
winans--
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
--yes.
there
is
the
remedy
that
the
wall
street
journal
took.
they
fired
him.
they
wrote
about
him
on
the
front
page
of
their
newspaper;
went
into
every
aspect
of
his
personal
life,
both
that
relevant
to
the
ethical
breach
and
that
not
relevant
to
it,
and
effectively
have
drummed
him
out
of
the
profession.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
there
is
no
judicial
remedy,
your
honor
because
there
is
no
fraud
that
he
has
committed
within
the
meaning
of
any
state
law,
or
within
the
meaning
of
any
federal
securities
law.
there
are
potential
civil
remedies,
if
the
wall
street
journal
can
establish
some
kind
of--
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
--justice
o'connor,
there
are
i
guess
three
main
reasons
that
we
have
on
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
side.
number
one,
that
the
simple...
that
the
breach
of
a
private
policy:
of
the
undisclosed
breach,
of
a
private
policy,
is
not
a
criminal
fraud.
now
number
two,
that
here
the
only--
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
--i
think
that
they
have...
that
there
has
been,
certainly
pre-mcnally,
your
honor,
a
tendency
to
be
very
expansive
in
the
view
of
what
is
fraud,
and
that
many
cases
in
the
circuits
have
suggested
that
whenever
one
violates
a
rule
of
one's
employer,
there
is
potential
mail
or
wire
fraud
exposure.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
our
position
is
that,
the
kind
of
injury
which
is
asserted
here,
namely
a
putative
reputational
injury,
is
not
the
kind
of
injury
that
is
cognizable
under
the
mail
or
wire
fraud
statutes.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
but
the
suggestion,
the
process...
the
district
court
held
not
that
there
was,
in
fact,
reputational
harm
here;
not
that
winans
intended
reputational
harm,
but
that
because
he
could
contemplate
that,
if
his
unethical
conduct
was
discovered
and
became
public,
though
that
was
not
his
aim,
obviously;
that
that
could
cause
diminished
reputation
of
the
employer
and
that,
in
turn,
could
have
economic
impact
on
the
wall
street
journal.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
well,
the
short
answer,
justice
white,
is
i
think
that
there
can
be
a
property
interest
in
the
publication
schedule,
but
the
question
is,
in
what
way
are
they
deprived
of
that
property
interest
by
foster
winans'
conduct?
they...
when
i
use--
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
--but,
if
foster
winans,
for
example--
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
--but
the
fact
of
secrecy
has
no
independent
value,
we
submit,
except
vis-a-vis,
competitors.
if
foster
winans
were
to
have
told
his
mother
about
the
interesting
article
that
he
had
written
that
was
going
to
appear
on
monday's
newspaper,
thought
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
wall
street
journal
policy,
it
does
not
hurt.
there
is
no
economic
impact.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
what
we
are
saying
is,
the
only
way
that
a
property
interest
can
be
said
to
exist
is
in
the
exclusive
use
of
the
knowledge,
and
that
that
is
a
meaningful
interest
only
vis-a-vis
competitors.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
the
journal
itself,
and
very
specifically,
and
at
trial,
through
its
testimony,
disclaimed
any
intention
of
giving
market
advice
to
its
readers,
or
to
recommending
or
suggesting
they
buy
or
sell
stocks.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
the
journal
could
claim
to
be
defrauded
with
respect
to
a
function
which
it
specifically
denies
that
it
has.
and
a
purpose
that
it
specifically
disclaims
with
respect
to
the
column.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
this
theory
could
not
be
used
because
it
is
not
charged
at
all.
they
were...
the
first
time
there
is
even
mention
of
a
potential
value
of
the
column
as
an
investment
advice
vehicle
to
investors,
which
the
journal
itself,
therefore,
has
a
property
interest
in,
is
in
the
supplemental
post-mcnally
brief.
that
argument
was
never
made
below.
your
honors,
if
i
might
return
to
the...
well,
let
me
follow
up
the
argument
about
reputation
while
we
are
here.
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
can
follow
a
process
of
"my
ethical
breach,
which
is
not
itself
illegal
conduct,
but
my
ethical
breach,
if
it
is
discovered,
can
cause
reputational
damage
to
my
employer...
that
might
have
economic
fallout;
therefore
i
am
guilty
of
a
federal
mail
and
wire
fraud,
assuming
the
requisite
mailings
and
wires.
"
what
you
have
done,
essentially,
is
elevated
every
employee
ethical
breach
into
a
federal
crime.
you
have
given
federal
prosecutors
a
vehicle,
even
though
you
start
with
conduct
that
is
not
illegal,
for
establishing
a
process,
if
it
is
discovered...
though
that
is
not
intended,
if
the
public
therefore
thinks
less
of
your
employer,
though
there
is
no
finding
that
that
occurred
here,
and
indeed,
every
indication
is
that
it
did
not
occur
here...
and
if
that
reputational
damage
can
translate
somehow
into
economic
harm.
so
all
ethical
breaches
by
employees
are
elevated
to
the
status
of
federal
crimes,
and
we
submit
that
quite
aside
from
trivializing
the
criminal
law
as
that
would
do,
and
quite
aside
from
federalizing
the
rules
pertaining
to
employee
ethical
breaches,
and
quite
aside
from
the
enormous
discretion
that
this
places
in
the
hands
of
prosecutors,
that
there
are
three
additional
reasons
on
the
facts
of
this
case
why
that
putative
reputational
damage
cannot
translate
into
the
kind
of
economic
injury
which
mcnally
requires
the
schemers
aim
for.
number
one
is,
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
the
testimony
is
undisputed,
the
wall
street
journal
had
never
made
known
its
policy
to
the
readers
or
to
the
public
prior
to
the
events
of
this
case.
that
it
never
appeared
in
the
newspaper,
and
never
appeared
in
any
public
filing
of
the
wall
street
journal's...
and
therefore
reliance
by
members
of
the
public
on
the
existence
of
the
policy
or
on
adherence
to
the
policy,
had
never
been
invited.
the
second
reason
is
that
the
court...
this
court
has
held
in
construing
the
term,
v.
davis,
in
the
context
of
state
deprivation
of
property
without
due
process
of
law,
that
property
does
not
include
reputation.
and
with
respect
to
interpreting
the
1868
civil
rights
amendment,
the
14th
amendment,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
relatively
contemporaneous
mail
and
wire
fraud
statute,
we
should
not
assume
that
congress--
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
--justice
o'connor,
the
think
about
reputation,
and
the
facts
there,
it
were
the
case
that,
because
the
plaintiff
there
had
been
defamed
and
called
a
"pickpocket",
and
therefore
it
was
less
likely
that
he
would
be
employed
by
the
bank
as
a
teller,
or
less
likely
that
he
would
get
any
one
of
a
number
of
employment
opportunities,
the
damage
to
reputation
could
only,
as
a
theoretical
level,
as
a
putative
injury
concept,
be
stretched
out
to
mean
"potential
economic
harm".
so
it
seems
to
us
that,
while
i
think
your
honor
is
quite
correct,
that
paul
v.
davis
simply
went
off
on
a
"reputation"
concept,
reputation,
the
value
of
my
name,
the
value
of
reputation,
is
the
way
it
translates
economically.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
i
think
that
is
clearly
the
case.
we
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that,
because
of
the
interpretation
in
one,
but
the
relatively
contemporaneous
nature
of
the
statute--
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
we
believe
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
do
so
for
the
very
reason
that
we
have
here,
that
you
elevate
an
ethical
breach
into
a
federal
crime
if
the
ethical
breach,
if
discovered,
could
cause
reputational
injury.
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
at...
here,
as
i
go
through
the
litany
of
things
that
we
believe
are
wrong
with
using
reputational
damage
as
the
fulcrum
for
mail
and
wire
fraud
injury,
the
third
reason
that
we
would
give
here,
is
that
there
is
simply
no
intent
by
these
petitioners
to
deprive
the
wall
street
journal
of
its
reputation.
and
we
think
that
mcnally
has
set
forth
a
requirement
in
defining
what
is
the
"scheme"
that
there
be
an
intent
to
deprive
the
victim
of
money
or
property.
here
the
pre-mcnally
concurrent
findings
of
fact
below,
were
that,
was
that
there
was
no
intent
and
that,
indeed,
it
was
the
aim
of
the...
of
mr.
winans'
and
the
co-petitioners,
to
maintain
the
reputation
and
the
journalistic
integrity
of
the
articles,
because,
in
the
words
of
the
courts
below,
"only
if
that
reputation
were
maintained.
"
could
their
hopes,
or
their
perception
that
the
articles
would
have
impact,
and
therefore
that
their
trades
would
be
profitable,
only
if
it
were
maintained,
could
that
arrangement
succeed.
turning,
if
i
might,
back
to
the
mail
and
wire
fraud...
well,
let
me
just
address
one
other
point
with
respect
to
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
statute,
and
then
turn
to
the
securities
law:
we
have
also
argued
as
a
third
grounds
for
reversal
of
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
convictions,
that
the
mailings
and
wirings
here,
what
is
alleged
is
that
the
printing
of
the
wall
street
journal
articles,
and
that
the
mailings
of
the
wall
street
journal
to
subscribers
the
following
day
were
"wires
and
mails"
caused
for
the
purpose
for
this
scheme
to
deprive
the
wall
street
journal
of
property.
and
if
one
focuses
on
the
publication
schedule,
or
the
exclusive
use
of
the
publication
schedule
is
that
which
is
deprived,
even
in
this
context
of
it
not
going
to
a
competitor,
of
it
not
going
to
the
new
york
times,
as
the
property
that
is
deprived,
on
the
facts
here,
that
all
occurs
on
the
day
preceding
publication
of
the
article,
when
there
is
a
leak
in
the
information,
when
the
initial
purchase
of
stock
in
anticipation
of
the
article,
occurs.
so
if
that
is
a
cognizable
property
deprivation,
it
is
something
which
has
fully
occurred
before
the
wires,
before
the
mailings,
of
the
wall
street
journal,
and
in
no
sense
can
those
wires
or
mailings
be
said
to
be
caused
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme
to
defraud.
there
is
no
fraud
alleged
here
nor,
in
fact,
was
there
a
fraud
upon
the
readers
of
the
journal
or
on
the
investors.
and
so
even
though
that
subsequent
publication
may
enable,
may
cause
to
exist,
that
process
by
which
winans
believes
he
is
going
to
be
successful
in
the
stock
market,
that
is
not
the
cognizable
fraud
that
is
alleged
on
the
wall
street
journal
in
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
counts.
and
therefore,
these
mailings
and
wires,
if
that
language,
"cause
for
the
purpose
of
executing.
"
has
any
meaning,
are
not
sufficient
here.
with
respect,
if
i
might
return
to
the
securities
law
point:
we
believe
that
the
requirement
of
fraud
that
the
participants
in
market
transactions,
how
investors
be
defrauded,
follows
from
the
language
of
the
statute,
for
which
the
misappropriation
theory
is
not
a
substitute.
one
must,
in
each
case
where
the
government
alleges
that
misappropriation
has
occurred,
look
to
the
particular
conduct
which
the
government
asserts
constitutes
that
misappropriation,
and
then
determine
if
that
conduct
constitutes
"a
manipulative
or
deceptive
device
or
contrivance
employed
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
"
as
section
10b
requires,
and
is
it
a
fraud,
as
rule
10b-5
requires?
and
those
terms
in
turn,
have
come
to
have
recognized
meaning.
a
"manipulative
or
deceptive
device
or
contrivance.
"
prescribes
conduct
directed
at
investors.
the
hoodwinking
of
investors,
either
indirectly
through
manipulations,
watched
sales,
matched
orders,
things
aimed
at
the
market
as
a
whole,
but
designed
to
affect
individual
investor
conduct,
or
the
"hoodwinking
of
investors
directly
through
deceptions,
falsehoods,
half-truths,
or
silence,
where
there
is
a
duty
to
speak.
"
and
that
fraud
under
rule
10b-5
encompasses
"deceptions
or
manipulations
designed
to
affect
an
investment
decision
to
the
economic
detriment
of
a
market
participant,
or
to
deprive
a
person
of
investment
value.
"
virtually
by
definition,
a
private
wrong
endangering
an
employer's
reputation
is
not
what
the
securities
laws
are
about.
there
are,
when
you
have
an
alleged
misappropriation,
there
are
two
directions
that
you
look
instead
of
the
traditional
one
direction.
you
look
to
see
if
the
conduct
defrauds
the
seller
of
the
stock
that
you
are
buying,
and
you
can
look
to
see
if
the
conduct
defrauds
the
person
or
entity
from
whom
this
information
is
allegedly
misappropriated.
and
you
ask
yourself
in
each
instance,
"is
that
a
securities
fraud"?
with
respect
to
that
first
view,
is
the
seller
defrauded?
that
is
not
something
that
is
alleged
here
because
it
could
not
be
alleged
under
the
court's
holding
in
chiarella
that
there
is
a
"requirement
of
disclosure
with
respect
to
informational
advantages
only
where
there
is
a
pre-existing
relationship
which
gives
rise
to
the
duty
to
disclose.
"
and
with
respect
to
the
second
view
here,
is
there
a
securities
fraud
upon
the
entity
from
whom
the
information
has
been
misappropriated...
has
the
printer,
chiarella,
defrauded
the
acquiring
company
in
that
case
by
virtue
of
the
misappropriation,
has
winans
here
committed
a
securities
fraud
upon
the
wall
street
journal
by
virtue
of
misappropriation?
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
"yes",
in
chiarella,
it
is
because
the
acquiring
companies
are
defrauded
in
their
capacity
as
investors
and
in
their
capacity
as
market
participants.
and
we
submit
that
certainly
is
not
the
case
with
respect
to
the
wall
street
journal.
your
honors,
the
whole
notion
that
a
private
employer
can
make
a
special
securities
law
for
his
employees
simply
does
not
make
sense.
here
we
had
a
wall
street
journal
rule
presented
to
its
employees
as
intended
to
go
beyond
the
requirements
of
the
law,
and
suddenly
it
has
the
force
of
the
law.
let
us
suppose
that
that
rule
said
explicitly
what
we
believe
it
means
implicitly,
namely
that,
here
at
the
wall
street
journal,
we
want
to
follow
the
highest
ethical
requirements,
while
we
recognize
that
the
equal
access
to
information
rule
was
not
accepted
by
the
supreme
court
majority
in
the
chiarella
decision,
we
nonetheless
believe
that
it
represents
a
higher
standard
of
ethics,
which
we
want
wall
street
journal
employees
to
follow,
so
that
we
may
have
the
highest
reputation.
"if
you
do
not
follow
the
equal
access
to
information
rule,
your
employment
here
will
be
terminated.
"
that,
in
essence,
is
what
happened
here.
that,
as
a
matter
of
internal
policy,
policy
which
the
wall
street
journal
made
up
on
pain
of
firing
those
who
do
not
follow
the
policy,
that
by
adopting
that
rule,
the
government
claims
that
therefore
the
securities
laws
are
changed
with
respect
to
the
employees
of
the
wall
street
journal.
your
honors,
we
submit
that,
if
congress
wants
to
pass
a
statute
which
says
that,
"utilization
in
the
stock
market
of
an
informational
advantage
in
violation
of
a
private
contract
with
anyone
is
a
new
species
of
crime.
"
that
is
fine.
because
then
we
will
all
know
what
the
rules
are.
but
to
try
to
stuff
that
result,
in
effect,
into
existing
securities
fraud
legislation,
is
simply
to
rewrite
the
law
to
give
it
a
new
ex
post
facto
interpretation,
and
we
submit,
is
contrary
to
the
very
integrity
of
the
law.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
might
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
don
d.
buchwald
thank
you,
your
honor.
very
briefly,
on
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
analysis
in
the
deprivation
of
information
point:
we
believe
that
all
roads
lead
to
a
putative
reputational
damage,
is
what
the
government
is
talking
about.
here
you
have
lawfully
acquired
information.
when
you
use
information,
unlike
a
car,
you
are
not
depriving
the
other
person
of
that
information
either
permanently,
temporarily,
or
partially.
and
the
cutoff
point,
it
seems
to
us,
as
to
where
information
takes
on
some
kind
of
property
value
in
anything
even
remotely
resembling
a
mcnally
sense,
is
either
when
you
use
the
information
in
competition
with
your
employer,
or
where
you
are
giving
the
information
to
a
competitor
to
use
in
competition;
in
essence
in
a
trade
secret
sense.
with
respect
to
general
fried's
suggestion
that,
the
in
connection
with
requirement
is
satisfied
if
the
scheme
is
for
the
purpose
of
buying
or
selling
stocks,
in
addition
to
the
example
which
justice
white
gave,
the
example
of
obtaining
information
from
a
prominent
investment
advisor,
if
i
join
the
joe
granville
hotline
with
a
bounced
check
and
no
intention
actually
of
paying
mister
granville
for
his
advice
and
i
then
get
a
telegram
in
return
for
my
one
thousand
dollar
bounced
check,
saying
that
he
recommends
xyz
company
and
then
i
now
go
out
and
buy
the
stock
in
xyz,
under
the
government's
theory,
that
would
be
a
securities
fraud,
because
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
trading
in
securities.
and
essentially,
because
the
government
wishes
to
move
away
from
these
examples
of
the
embezzlement,
and
the
use
of
information
fraudulently
obtained
from
an
investment
advisor,
they
place
a
limiting
principle
of
fairness
on
the
market,
which
we
believe
cannot
be
found
on
the
market,
which
we
believe
is
not
and
cannot
be
found,
in
the
language
of
xx.
