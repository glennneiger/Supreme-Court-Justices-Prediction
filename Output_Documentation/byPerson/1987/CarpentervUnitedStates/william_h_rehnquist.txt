mr.
buchwald,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
congress
could,
in
the
mail
fraud
statute,
define
v.
davis,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
say
it
has
not
done
so
yet?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
your
argument
is
only
partly
that
it
would
be
"unwise",
i
take
it.
your
argument
is
basically
against
constructive
crimes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
buchwald.
we
will
hear
now
from
general
fried.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
are
speaking
now
to
the
mail
fraud
count
or
to
the
securities
count?
chief
justice
rehnquist
"that"
is
what
they
took?
what
precisely
is
"that"?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
now
you
can
misappropriate
a
fact?
chief
justice
rehnquist
snep
was
not
a
criminal
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
if
congress
wanted
to
say
in
so
many
words,
"no
person
shall
breach
a
duty
of
confidentiality
to
their
employer.
"
in
these
circumstances,
the
case
would
give
one
little
trouble.
but
congress
has
spoken
in
very
general
terms
and
it
seems
to
me
you
are
kind
of
putting
layers
on
the
thing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
a
decision
of
this
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
turn
back
the
odometer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
general
fried.
mr.
buchwald,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
buchwald.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
86-422,
carpenter
against
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
