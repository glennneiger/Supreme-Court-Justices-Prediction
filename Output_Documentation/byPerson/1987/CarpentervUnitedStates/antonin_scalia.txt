what
if
the
insider
uses
inside
information
that
pertains
not
to
his
own
corporation
but
to
another
corporation
that
this
corporation
somehow,
somehow
happens
to
have
acquired?
and
he
uses
that
to
purchase
shares
of
that
other
corporation...
you
would
say
that
that
would
not
be
within
the
securities
laws
either?
justice
scalia
mr.
buchwald,
why
is
that
so?
i
assume
that,
i
assume
that
one
reason
the
wall
street
journal
is
purchased
by
a
lot
of
people
is
that
they
read
articles
such
as
this
one
about
a
company
that
may
contain
public
information,
but
it
brings
it
all
together
and
i
say,
"gee,
if
i
read
that
article
and
purchase
that
stock
right
away,
i
will
get
a
rise
of
30
points.
"
let
us
say.
0
[mirth.]
to
the
extent
that
mr.
winans,
or
anybody
else,
leaks
in
advance
the
fact
that
this
article
is
coming
out,
or
using
his,
the
knowledge
that
the
article
is
coming
out,
to
make
a
profit,
the
rise
will
not
be
30
points;
it
will
be
29
1/2
points.
i
mean,
he
milked
some
of
that
rise.
now,
why
is
that
not
something
of
value
to
the
wall
street
journal?
indeed,
why
would
not
the
wall
street
journal
itself
trade
on
the
knowledge
that
it
is
coming
out
with
an
article?
the
only
explanation
i
have
is
that
it
knows
that,
if
it
traded
on
that,
the
jump
would
not
be
as
much
and
its
articles
would
not
be
as...
have
as
much
of
an
impression.
and
therefore
they
would
not
sell
as
many
newspapers.
now
why
is
that
not
something
of
value
that
he
has
taken
away?
the
half-point
spread?
justice
scalia
people
just
read
it
from
general
interest?

justice

estoppel?
is
it
estoppel
you
are
arguing
here?
is
that
why
this
theory
cannot
be
used?
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
this
would
have
been
an
offense
even
if
there
had
never
been
any
publication
of
the
fact
that
this
is
what
winans
did,
putting
the
reputation
at-risk
constitutes
damage?
justice
scalia
does
not
fraud
ordinarily
require
that
the
same
respect
in
which
you
are
damaged
i
am
benefitted?
for
example,
if
someone
pays
me
money
to
trick
you
into
burning
your
house
down,
it
does
not
seem
to
me
i
could
be
prosecuted
for
defrauding
you
of
your
house?
it
would
be
a
very
strange
use
of
the
word,
"defraud".
i
somehow
have
to
get
the
benefit
from
what
you
are
deprived
of,
and
that
is
what
i
do
not
see
here.
there
may
have
been
either
an
actual
harm
to
the
reputation,
or
a
threat
to
the
reputation,
but
it
is
not
that
same
harm
to
the
wall
street
journal
which
constitutes
the
benefit
to
the
person
who
allegedly
did
the
defrauding.
justice
scalia
but
not
what
they
sought
to
deprive
the
journal
of,
as
was
pointed
out
by
your
opponent.
to
the
contrary,
they
did
absolutely
not
want
to
deprive
the
wall
street
journal
of
its
reputation.
the
continuation
of
its
reputation
was
essential
to
their
scheme.
they
were
not
depriving
it
of
its
reputation.
justice
scalia
well,
more
than
that,
you
have
property,
and
that
is
what
is
hard
to
take
here.
you
are...
i
think
what
you
have
said
is
true;
it
builds
on
existing
common
law
concepts,
but
one
of
those
concepts
is
property.
and
the
property
you
are
asserting
that
has
been
taken
here
is--
justice
scalia
--is
the
fact
of
later
publication
and
the
date
of
the
publication.
justice
scalia
what
is
the
closest
criminal
fraud
case
that
you
would
have
to
this
species
of
property?
what
case
of
ours
comes
the
closest?
a
trade
secret
case,
where
a
trade
secret
was
purloined?
justice
scalia
i
must
say
that
the
concept
of
putting
something
at-risk
as
harm
sufficient
to
support
a
criminal
charge
is,
it
seems
to
me,
rather
strange.
it
is
not
even
harm
sufficient
to
support
a
tort
action,
or
we
would
have
a
lot
of
tort
suits
for
near
misses
in
traffic
accidents--
0
[mirth.]
--instead
of
even
fender-benders.
justice
scalia
is
that
the
theory
of
it?
that
he
could
have
done
you
harm?
i
never
heard
that
theory
espoused.
i
thought
that
the
theory
is,
he
should
not
be
on
your
land?
the
harm
is,
he
is
on
your
land.
you
have
a
right
to
have
him
off
your
land.
justice
scalia
well,
you
just
said
that,
but
i
do
not
know
why
that
is
self-evident,
and
i
never
heard
it
before?
i
do
not
know
why
you
think
you
even
have
to
get
to
reputational
harm.
they
have
appropriated
the
property
and
you
say
you
presume
that
there
is
harm:
your
property
is
appropriated.
justice
scalia
i
know
that.
justice
scalia
general
fried,
can
i...
will
you
tell
me
why
this
hypothetical
is
not
covered
by
the
mail
fraud
statute,
or
perhaps
it
is?
i
am
employer
of
the
fred
m.
smith
company,
and
mr.
smith
tells...
one
of
his
employees
asks
him,
you
know,
"what
does
"m"
stand
for?
"
and
smith
says,
"well,
i
will
tell
you
this
just
in
confidence.
"
he
is
a
trusted
employee;
"it
is
marmaduke.
"
"i
am
really
very
ashamed
of
it.
"
the
employee
writes
to
a
newspaper
and
says,
"you
know,
fred
m.
smith's
middle
name
is
"marmaduke".
"
and
he
gets
some...
he
gets
five
bucks
from
the
newspaper
for
that.
is
that
mail
fraud?
justice
scalia
why
not?
justice
scalia
right.
0
[mirth.]
i
believe
you
so
far.
justice
scalia
the
mere
taking
of
the
confidential
information
is
the
harm
is
what
you
said
before.
and
the
mere
using
of
it
for
your
own
advantage...
it
does
not
matter
if
the
car
is
harmed
or
not.
the
mere
taking
of
it
was
enough.
justice
scalia
doesn't
involve
"marmaduke"?
right?
justice
scalia
well,
you
might
draw
the
line
there;
others
might
draw
the
line
between
a
genuine
trade
secret
of
the
sort
that
is
used
in
manufacturing
processes
or
something
like
that,
and
the
mere
fact
that
an
article
is
going
to
appear
in
the
wall
street
journal
several
months
from
now
you
have
to
draw
the
line
somewhere,
right?
