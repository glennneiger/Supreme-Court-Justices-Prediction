justice
white
do
you
not
think
that
the
employer,
that
the
wall
street
journal
had
maybe
a
property
right
in
its
publication
schedule?
is
that
not
a
sort
of
a
business
secret?
justice
white
well,
it
was
certainly
no
longer
a
secret
that
they,
if
they--
justice
white
--have
not
been
deprived,
if
they
were
trying
to
keep
that
secret
and
it
is
suddenly
given
out
to
a
limited
number
of
people,
it
is
no
longer
a
secret.
justice
white
whatever
property
interest
the
paper
has
is
suddenly
gone.
so
you
are
really
saying
there
are
really
no
property
interest
that
needs
to
be
considered?
justice
white
now,
a
while
ago
you
though
there
had
to
be
something
beyond
the
appropriation
of
the
property?
justice
white
well,
it
is
like
your
car
example,
you...
he
took
my
car.
justice
white
well,
general,
do
you
think
that
this
argument
carries
the
day
in
the
securities
side
of
this
case?
justice
white
you
mean
just
the
fact
that
he
has
defrauded
his
employer
sustains
the
securities?
justice
white
general.
fried,
what
if
there
had
been
no
wall
street
journal
work
rule?
would
either
the
mail
fraud
count
or
the
securities
count
be
good?
could
it
be
good
without
that
rule?
justice
white
so
it
is
a
federal
securities
crime
for
any
embezzler
of
money
to
buy
securities?
justice
white
the
only
reason
he
embezzled
was
to
buy.
just
like
this
fellow.
the
only
reason
he
stole
this
information
was
to
buy
stock.
justice
white
you
said
the
connection
was
"palpable".
justice
white
yes,
but
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
reason
he
embezzled
it
was
to
buy
securities.
justice
white
well,
but
he
did
not.
justice
white
but
he
did
not.
justice
white
but
he
did
not.
he
just
went
to
buy
securities.
he
got
the
money
and
went
right
across
the
street.
justice
white
why
can
you
not
say
that
in
this
case?
justice
white
oh,
i
do
not
know.
he
gave
it
to
his
co-conspirators.
justice
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
petitioners
were
convicted
for
violating
the
securities
laws
and
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
statutes.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
those
convictions
and
we
granted
certiorari.
we
affirmed
the
--
all
of
the
judgment
below
with
respect
to
the
securities
laws
by
an
equally
divided
court
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
affirmed
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
convictions.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
