justice
stevens
mr.
buchwald,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
right
there?
supposing...
i
know
the
theory
of
the
case
as...
tried
was
a
little
different.
but
supposing,
on
precisely
the
same
facts,
there
had
been
an
allegation
in
the
indictment
or
the
complaint,
or
whatever
it
was,
that
saidas,
that
said,
"as
a
by-product
of
this
scheme,
investors
were
injured,
those
who
sold
or
purchased
from,
winans?
"
they
just
threw
that
in
and
then
they
proved
it.
would
that
amount
to
a...
would
there
have
been
a
violation
then?
justice
stevens
in
that
you
could
reasonably
conclude
that
there
was
some
injury
to
market
participants
as
a
result
of
this?
justice
stevens
but
in
the
short
answer,
you
are
saying
that,
taking
these
facts,
even
if
they
had
alleged
and
proved
adverse
market
impact
as
a
result
of
the
fraud,
that
would
still
not
be
a
violation
because...
because
what?
justice
stevens
but
why
is
this
any
less
of
a
fraud
on
the
market
participants
than
if
the
information
that
gave
him
an
advantage
in
trading
was
corporate
information
instead
of
information
about
the
timing
of
his
columns?
justice
stevens
but
you
never
have
that
on
a
trade
on
the
open
market.
justice
stevens
general
fried,
i
am
a
little
troubled
because,
are
you
claiming
that
the
obtaining
of
this
property,
namely
the
information,
was
done
by
fraud?
justice
stevens
no,
it
was
misused,
as
you
say,
but
the
acquisition
of
the
information
was
not
obtained
by
fraud?
justice
stevens
i
am
not
contending
the
information
was,
there
was
nothing
dishonest
about
his
finding
out
when
the
column
was
going
to
be
published,
was
there?
justice
stevens
i
do
not
know
how
he
is
guilty
of
mail
fraud?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
you
are
saying
that,
to
complete
your
elements
of
the
crime,
you
have
got
to
have
the
harm,
and
you
say
the
harm
is
the
injury
to
the
reputation?
justice
stevens
but
yet
you
are
saying
it
is
different
from
the
intangible
right
to
honest
and
good
government
somehow,
the
intangible
right
to
honest
and
good
reporting,
is
different
in
intent.
i
am
worried
about
the
mcnally
implications
when
you
focus
on
this
intangible
interest
in
good
reputation.
justice
stevens
but
it
is
also
an
element
to
deprive
the
wall
street
journal
of
its
good
reputation
and
so-forth.
justice
stevens
but
you
do
agree
that
some
kind
of
harm
of
that
nature
beyond
the
acquisition
of
the
property
is
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
offense?
justice
stevens
yes,
it
is
an
essential
element
of
the
defense.
justice
stevens
if
that
is
true,
why
is
this
"harm",
which
i
would
call
some
sort
of
an
intangible
harm,
why
is
that
different
than
the
"harm"
in
mcnally?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
i
suppose
in
a
sense,
one
could
say
in
mcnally
there
was
a
property
interest
in
controlling
the
placement
of
insurance
and
they
acquired
that
without
violating
any
laws
by
exercising
their
authority.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
i
thought
really,
and
there
is
a
misunderstanding
on
my...
i
thought
you
were
saying,
as
a
matter
of
law,
even
though
there
is
no
physical
or
pecuniary
injury,
there
is
a
legal
harm
by
his
having
taken
something
he
was
not
entitled
to?
