justice
o'connor
but
why
is
there
no
fraud
sufficient
for
a
mail
fraud
or
wire
fraud,
purposes?
justice
o'connor
but
the
cases
have
been
pretty
generous
in
looking
at
different
schemes
or
artifices,
as
sufficing
for
purposes
of
a
fraud.
justice
o'connor
but
you
said
there
were
three
reasons.
you
think
there
is
no
fraud?
we
might
disagree
on
that.
now,
what
is
the
next
reason?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
is
more
than
that.
it
is
"reputation"
with
an
economic
effect.
i
do
not
think
any
of
our
cases
have
dealt
with
it
in
such
a
way
such
as
to
indicate
that
could
not
be
enough.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
that
in
paul
v.
davis,
the
court
really
just
said
that
reputation
alone,
apart
from
some
more
tangible
interest,
such
as
employment,
or
so
forth,
would
not.
so
i
think
you
are
reading
a
lot
more
into
that
case
than
is
warranted.
justice
o'connor
and
it
was
a
confidential
information
which
was
then
used
by
them
in
their
scheme?
justice
o'connor
now,
does
mcnally
bear
on
this
problem?
