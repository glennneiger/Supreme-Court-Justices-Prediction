mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
few
preliminary
things
to
clear
up.
it
should
be
quite
clear
that,
in
our
view,
the
property
which
was
misappropriated
here
was
not
reputation.
it
was
confidential
information.
that
was
the
property.
and
as
to
that,
there
was,
of
course,
a
very
clear
intent
to
deprive.
a
very
clear
intent
to
misappropriate
the
confidential
information.
mr.
charles
fried
in
fact,
in
that
respect,
i
speak
to
both
counts,
but
certainly
to
the
mail
fraud
count.
the
harm
comes
about
via
the
reputation
which
was
put
at-risk.
the
fact
that
they
did
not
intend
to
get
caught,
i
think,
is
not
a
particularly
compelling...
answer
to
that
point.
now,
there
is
another
issue
that
has
been
raised
which,
i
feel,
must
be
answered
at
the
outset.
mr.
charles
fried
oh,
it
certainly
does.
i
think
judge
stewart,
in
his
findings,
and
we
set
out
this
point
in
our,
in
a
footnote
in
our
supplemental
brief,
made
the
point
very
well.
the
information
was
the
property
of
the
wall
street
journal.
if
somebody
takes
my
car,
justice
scalia,
and
returns
it
with
a
full
tank
of
gas
and
no
dents,
it
is
not
okay
for
them
to
say,
"oh,
nothing
happened".
they
have
deprived
me
of
my
car.
true,
they
did
not
intend
to
get
caught,
and
they
did
not
get
caught
until
they
brought
the
car
back.
but
nevertheless
they
deprived
me
of
my
property
and
they
put
it
at-risk
in
ways
which
i
am
entitled
to
prevent
being
put
at-risk.
i
am
lucky
there
were
no
dents,
but
there
might
have
been.
and
i
am
entitled
to
control
that
property
to
prevent
that
happening.
that,
i
think
is
just
what
judge
stewart
meant
in
his
findings.
mr.
charles
fried
in
fact,
i
would
differ
there.
i
think
there
is
considerable
symmetry
between
the
mechanism
of
benefit,
i
would
say,
justice
scalia,
on
one
hand,
and
the
mechanism
of
the
potential
harm
on
the
other:
the
mechanism
of
benefit
to
winans
and
his
confederates
is
that
people
believe
in
this
column
and
do
not
imagine
that,
in
fact,
all
this
stuff
has
been
traded
upon
and
it
is
just
to
be
discounted.
if
it
were
not
for
that
conviction...
your
questions
to
mr.
buchwald
earlier
pointed
that
out...
if
it
were
not
for
that
conviction
on
the
part
of
the
readers,
the
fraud
would
not
have
its
effect.
so
the
reputation
is
there
on
both
sides.
it
is
the
very
thing
that
the
wall
street
journal
is
selling
its
newspapers
on,
on
one
hand.
now,
that
is
not
very
much
money
on
any
particular
day,
but
over
the
years
it
mounts
up.
that
is
the
very
thing
the
journal
is
selling
its
newspapers
on
on
the
one
hand,
and
it
is
the
very
thing
which
winans
and
his
confederates
are
profiting
from
on
the
other.
so
i
think
that
there
is
quite
considerable--
mr.
charles
fried
--no,
they
were
depriving
it
of
the
information.
the
information
was
valuable
to
the
wall
street
journal
and
its
confidentiality
was
valuable
to
the
wall
street
journal.
the
fact
that
nobody
outside
knew
what
the
column
would
be
and
what
day
it
would
run
was
valuable
to
the
journal
and
it
was
very
valuable
to
winans
and
his
confederates.
and
that
is
what
they
took.
now,
the
point
has
been
urged
by
petitioners--
mr.
charles
fried
--the
confidential
information
regarding
the
timing
and
the
contents
of
the
column.
that
a
column
about...
that
a
column
saying
that
"digital
switch
is
going
to
have
some
good
luck,
we
think.
"
and
the
fact
that
that
column
was
going
to
appear
on
wednesday,
"that
fact"
is
what
they
misappropriated.
that
fact
was
entrusted
to
them.
mr.
charles
fried
the
information.
what
is
being
misappropriated
is
the
information
as
to
the
timing
and
content
of
the
column.
and
you
certainly
can--
mr.
charles
fried
--precisely.
this
court,
every
member
of
this
court
recognized
the
nature
of
confidential
information
in
an
employment
relation
in
the
snep
case,
where
the
court
said
that,
"even
in
the
absence
of
a
written
contract,
an
employee
has
the
fiduciary
obligation
to
protect
confidential
information
obtained
during
the
course
of
his
employment.
"
that
is
the
duty
which
he
breached.
that
precisely
is
the--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
think
mcnally
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
this
case.
because
mcnally
addressed
a
concern
that
the
government
was
federalizing
breaches
which
deprived...
employers
of
the
faithful
service
of
their
employees,
and
even
more
troublesome,
breaches
which
somehow
deprived
state
and
local
governments
of
good
government
and
the
faithful
service
of
public
service.
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
breach
of
loyalty,
the
same
breach
that
the
court
noticed
in
the
snep
case,
is
the
instrument,
not
the
end,
of
the
crime.
and
the
breach
of
loyalty
is
a
constant
feature
of
many
garden
variety
frauds
practiced
upon
employers--
mr.
charles
fried
--snep
was
not
a
criminal
case,
but
snep
recognized
that
there
is
this
duty
of
confidentiality.
and
that
duty
of
confidentiality
is
the
very
duty
which
winans
breached
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
fried
i
hope
not,
because
in
speaking
of
fraud,
congress
necessarily
assumed
the
ordinary
common
law
meaning
of
fraud.
fraud
can
only
take
place,
as
is
true
of
many
property
crimes,
on
the
shoulders,
as
it
were,
of
pre-existing
relations
within
the
civil
law.
and
the
criminal
cannot
reach
down
and
define
all
of
those
pre-existing
relations
before
the
crime
can
be
said
to
have
been
"properly
defined".
so
in
the
usual
case,
where
there
is
a
fraud,
what
you
have?
a
fraud
through
nondisclosure,
what
you
have
is
a
relationship
of
trust.
that
relationship
is
not
itself
defined
anywhere
in
the
criminal--
mr.
charles
fried
--confidential
information.
mr.
charles
fried
the
confid...
the
property
clearly
is
confidential
information.
and
we
have
to
stand
on
that;
we
are
quite
comfortable
standing
on
that.
it
is
quite
a
traditional,
though
intangible,
form
of
property
right.
this
court
in
ruckleshouse
v.
monsanto
recognized
trade
secrets
as
property
which
would
raise
5th
amendment
concerns,
so
i
see
no
difficulty
in
treating
confidential
information
as
a
species
of
property.
under
the
securities
law,
of
course,
one
need
not
even
find
property
with
that
degree
of
focus
and
specificity.
that
is
a
requirement
only
under
the
mail
fraud.
so
in
either
event,
i
think
we
are
not
doing
anything
so
far-out
as
petitioners
suggest.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
there
are
mcnally
cases
where
trade
secrets...
where
i
believe
confidential
information,
and
indeed,
privacy
rights
were
obtained,
where
somebody
obtained
access.
i
am
thinking
of
the
louderman
case
where
there
was
access
to
private
information,
and
that
access
was
thought
to
be
a
kind-of
interest
that
was
protected
by
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
statutes.
but
here,
in
speaking
of
confidential
information
as
property,
i
think
we
really
are
not
even
as
far
afield
as
that
particular
case
would
have
got.
it
is
not--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
is
not
in
this
court.
it
is
a
court
of
appeals
case.
mr.
charles
fried
the
fraud,
the
information
was
misappropriated
at
the
time
either
that
winans
himself
traded
on
it,
as
he
did
i
think
on
at
least
one
occasion,
or
when
he
communicated
it
to
his
confederates
for
the
purpose
of
trading
on
it.
mr.
charles
fried
no.
if
you
want
a
common
law
equivalent,
we
would
say,
"this
property
indeed
was
stolen,
but
the
form
of
theft
was
embezzlement
rather
than
larceny
by
trick
or
false
pretenses.
"
mr.
charles
fried
no.
the
initial
acquisition
of
the
information,
at
least
at
the
outset
or
the
scheme,
he
may
have
been
entirely
honest;
it
is
the
subsequent
use
of
the
information
which
had
been
entrusted
to
him,
just
like
any
other
servant
who
is
entrusted
with
property
and
who,
perhaps,
receives
that
property
in
quite
good
faith,
but
subsequently
misappropriates
it,
is
guilty
of
embezzlement.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
as
this
court
said
in
grin
v.
shine,
"embezzlement
is
fraud".
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
see
this
as
very
different
from
those
concerns
in
mcnally
because
what
was
the
object
of
the
fraud
here
was
the
confidential
information,
which
does
seem
to
be
a
familiar,
though
intangible,
form
of
property.
mr.
charles
fried
the
harm
of
its...
the
reputation
is
the
harm.
it
is
not
the
property.
the
reputation
is
the
harm
which
the
wall
street
journal
suffers,
or
which
is
at
least
put
at-risk.
there
is
no
need
to
show
that
it
suffered
harm.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
think
of
mr.
buchwald's
example
of
foster
winans
telling
his
mother
about
this
information
just
because
he
is
a
gossip.
i
think
that
is
quite
different.
mr.
charles
fried
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
harm
which
is
contemplated
or
risked.
i
do
not
think
that
it
has
to
actually
eventuate.
mr.
charles
fried
because
in
mcnally,
what
was
lacking,
what
was
utterly
lacking,
was
the
depriving
of
anything
like
the
property
which
in
this
case
we
have
i
would
say
we
have
in
sufficient
degree.
so
we
have
the
taking
of
the
property
and
the
only
question
is,
"how
does
depriving
the
wall
street
journal
of
this
property
harm
it?
"
if
somebody
takes
your
car,
justice
stevens,
and
it
is
up
in
the
country,
and
you
do
not
know
about
it,
they
have
taken
your
property
and
then
there
is
a
further
question,
"what
harm
has
it
done
you?
"
those
are
two
separate
questions.
mr.
charles
fried
one
might
have
said
that,
indeed.
i
think
we
urged
that
on
the
court...
unsuccessfully.
0
[mirth.]
but
i
think
that
we
had,
and
we
did
not
prevail,
in
part
because
the
interest
in
being
able
to
direct
where
insurance
commissions
will
go
is
a
rather
unfamiliar
species
of
property,
while
confidential
information
is
an
entirely
familiar
species
of
information.
mr.
charles
fried
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
in
every
trespass
action,
the
harm
is
presumed
in
just
the
way
it
is
presumed
here.
even
though
the
person
who
trespasses
upon
your
land
and
walks
across
to
the
other
side
without
bending
a
twig,
has
done
you
no
monetary
harm.
so
i
think
that
there
is
nothing--
mr.
charles
fried
--and
the
harm
here
is
he
should
not
be
trafficking
in
your
confidential
information
even
though
as
things
may
turn
out
through
your
own
diligence,
you
can
put
a
stop
to
the
reputational
loss
which
might
otherwise
come
about.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
judge
stuart
in
the
district
court
so-said--
mr.
charles
fried
--and
i
think
it
is
a
very
strong
argument.
i
am
making
a
further
argument
if
that
should
not
be
satisfactory
to
some
members
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
fried
oh,
i
think
the
harm
is
presumed,
justice
white.
if
i
thought
there
had
to
be
something
other
than--
mr.
charles
fried
--he
took
my
car,
returned
it,
full
tank
of
gas
and
no
dents.
exactly.
that
is
quite
sufficient.
mr.
charles
fried
turn
back
the
odometer?
0
[mirth.]
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
oh,
yes.
we
certainly
hold
that,
but
we
say
there
is
the
further
harm
which
is
the
reputational
harm.
and
both
harms
were
found
by
the
district
court,
so
we
stand
on
both
of
them.
now,
a
great
deal
has
been
made
of
the
point
that
we
are
seeking
here
to
criminalize
work
rules
of
an
employer.
and
with
respect,
i
think
that
is
a
"red
herring".
the
work
rule
is
neither
a
necessary
nor
a
sufficient
condition
of
the
kind
of
fraud
which
we
say
took
place
here.
the
heart
of
the
fraud
here
is
that
there
is
a
relationship
of
trust
and
that
somebody
who
is
in
that
relationship
of
trust
misappropriates
what
has
been
entrusted
to
him
to
the
detriment
of
the
one
who
trusts
him.
now,
the
work
rule
may
simply
set
the
context.
the
contours,
if
you
like,
of
what
relationship
of
trust
is.
so,
for
instance,
if
i
may
use
a
humble
example,
but
one
which
i
suppose
happens
every
day:
one
employer
may
say
to
his
employees,
"when
you
are
travelling,
we
consider
it
a
proper
travel
expense
for
reimbursement
to
charge
laundry,
telephone
calls
home,
pay-television
in
your
hotel
room.
"
and
another
employer
might
say,
"we
have
a
work
rule
that
no
only-business
expenses
and
all
of
those
are
private
expenses.
"
i
take
it
that
the
employee
who
submits
a
hotel
bill,
including
those
items,
to
the
second
employer,
and
does
it
by
mail
and
receives
a
check
back
by
mail,
has
defrauded
his
employer
because
he
is
in
a
relationship
of
trust
to
him;
the
employer
trusts
him
and
the
statement
there
is
an
implicit
statement
that
he
is
playing
by
those
rules,
and
he
has
broken
the
trust.
so
the
work
rule
is
really
just
a
part
of
the
context
of
trust.
mr.
charles
fried
oh,
i
think
so.
i
think
very
much
so.
i
think
as
to
the
securities--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
am
glad
you
brought
me
back
to
the
securities
fraud
issue,
because
the
concern
which
petitioners
raise
is
that
we
are
criminalizing
ordinary
frauds,
and
i
think
there
was
a
fraud
here;
there
was
a
breach
of
trust
here
via
the
securities
law
in
an
open-ended
way.
i
do
not
think
that
is
so
because
the
way
in
which
the
securities
law
makes
sure
that
the
fraud
is
securities-related,
securities-focused,
if
you
wish,
is
by
the
provision
that
the
fraud
which
the
rule
says
can
be
committed
on
any
person...
not
a
market
participant...
by
any
person,
must
be
in
connection
with
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities.
now,
we
maintain
that,
obviously,
this
fraud,
and
a
palpable
fraud
it
was,
was
a
fraud
that
was
committed
in
connection
with
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities.
how
could
it
have
been
more
closely
connected?
were
it
not
for
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities,
there
would
have
been
no
point.
the
whole
point
and
purpose
was
that:
were
it
not
for
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities,
the
rule
which
he
broke
would
have
no
point.
were
it
not
for
the
purchase
and
sale
and
securities,
the
reputational
harm
which
was
suffered
would
not
be
present.
so
the
connection
was
intimate.
mr.
charles
fried
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
am
confident
in
saying
it
is
not.
and
now
let
us
try
and
figure
out
why
not?
mr.
charles
fried
i
would
say
that
it
is
not
because
there
is
no
harm.
there
is
no
breach
of
trust,
and
i
say
that--
mr.
charles
fried
--because,
because...
the
notion
of
"confidential
information",
the
notion
of
"confidential
information"
and
of
"trust"--
mr.
charles
fried
--are
both
concepts
which
are
intended
to
have
enough
weight
and
seriousness
not
to
cover
every
trivial
peccadillo.
this
was
not
a
trivial
peccadillo.
it
netted
the
defendants
almost
$700,000.
mr.
charles
fried
in
that
respect,
i
would
draw
it
where
the
court
drew
it
in
the
snep
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
quite
sufficient.
now--
mr.
charles
fried
--in
the
absence
of
such
a
work
rule,
for
instance,
if
winans
had
worked
for
the
daily
scalper
instead
of
the
wall
street
journal,
i
would
suppose
that
they
would
not
have
been
given
the
context
of
the
relationship
that
there
existed,
there
would
have
been
no
understanding,
no
mutual
understanding,
that
this
kind
of
action
is
a
breach
of
trust.
the
work
rule
does
not
have
to
be
spelled
out
in
order
to
make
it
plain
that
a
particular
course
of
conduct
is
an
act
of
disloyalty
or
is
not
an
act
of
disloyalty.
but
the
work
rule
here
made
it
clear
beyond
peradventure
that
there
was
disloyalty.
i
do
not
know
if
the
financial
writers
for
the
new
york
times
have
been
made
aware
of
a
similar
work
rule,
but
if
there
is
an
understanding
that
that
is
the
nature
of
the
relation,
that
is
quite
sufficient.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
the
question
about
what
the
securities
laws
are
directed
against,
because
petitioners
say
they
are
"directed
against
protection
from
fraud
of
those
persons
who
are
trading
in
this
particular
case.
"
what
the
statute
says
is
that,
"in
general,
the
securities
laws
are
directed
at
procuring
or
assuring
honest
securities
markets.
"
and
in
specific,
they
say
via
10b-5,
"fraud
against
any
person
in
connection.
"
now,
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
has
been
done
is
not
at
all
a
parody
of
information
theory,
not
at
all.
because,
what
we
are
saying
is
that,
"when
you
trade
you
should
be
on
the
lookout
for
trading
against
people
who
are
smarter
than
you
are,
luckier
than
you
are:
better
informed
than
you
are...
but
not
against
people
who
have
stolen
the
information
which
they
are
trading
on.
"
because
that
kind
of
vigilance
encourages
what
i
would
call
a
"cascading
deterioration"
of
the
honesty
of
the
securities
markets
of
the
sort
which
the
charge,
at
least
in
chiarella,
did
not.
where
you
think
that
somebody
may
have
learned
something,
perhaps
as
an
eavesdropper...
well,
perhaps
by
accident,
through
greatest
diligence...
well
that
is
just
the
kind
of
incentive
you
want
to
put
out.
but
i
do
not
think
you
want
to
put
out
an
incentive
to
go
out
and
steal
information
yourself,
so
that
you
can
make
good
on
the
stock
market.
mr.
charles
fried
decidedly
not.
because
the
embezzler
does
not
commit
his
fraud
in
connection
with--
mr.
charles
fried
--he...
justice
white--
mr.
charles
fried
--he
had
the
money,
the
embezzler
did,
and
he
could
have
committed
it
to
the
parimutuel,
or
to
the
numbers
racket,
or
to
a
poker
game;
he
chose
to
commit
it
to
the
stock
market.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
but
he
might
have
changed--
mr.
charles
fried
--his
mind
and
the
harm
would
have
been
there--
mr.
charles
fried
--and
the
money
in
his
pocket.
mr.
charles
fried
the
crime
is
completed
and
fully
identified
at
the
moment
he
has
the
money
in
his
pocket.
what
he
does
with
it
next--
mr.
charles
fried
--no,
because
the
crime
is
not
completed
in
this
case
until
winans
either
trades
on
the
information
himself--
mr.
charles
fried
--for
the
purpose
of
trading.
mr.
charles
fried
if
he
just
told
it
to
his
mother
to
satisfy
gossip
interests,
there
would
have
been
no
effects.
but
he
communicated
for
the
purpose
of
trading.
if
there
are
no
further
question,
i
thank
the
court.
