justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
mathews,
there
is
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
in
erisa,
isn't
there?
justice
o'connor
and
this
court
has
said,
based
on
other
sue
and
be
sued
clauses
in
other
circumstances,
that
that
would
include
garnishment
proceedings,
hasn't
it?
justice
o'connor
so
it
certainly
is
conceivable
that
congress
intended
that
garnishment
procedures
be
included
within
the
scope
of
that
sue
and
be
sued
provision
as
being
all
right.
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course,
congress
did
enact
section
206(d)
dealing
expressly
with
assignment
or
alienation
of
benefits
for
pension
plans.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
deals
across
the
board.
justice
o'connor
well,
in
your
view,
206(d)
is
at
least
partially
superfluous
since
you
think
514
would
preempt
anyway.
so
why
did
congress
need
to
pass
206(d)?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
garnishment
law
is
generally
treated
as
a
matter
of
state
procedure?
justice
o'connor
i
am
not
convinced,
i
think,
that
congress
was
concerned
in
its
preemption
section
514
with
the
workload
burden
on
the
trustees.
i
know
that's
the
thrust
of
your
argument
on
behalf
of
the
trustees,
but
i'm
not
sure
congress
was
really
worried
about
that.
i
think
in
the
pension
area
they
were
worried
about
protecting
the
benefits
and
not
letting
the
employee
lose
the
benefit
of
the
pension
plan.
now
on
vacation
benefits,
they
seem
to
have
less
concern
about
protection
of
the
employee.
but
i
don't
find
a
lot
of
concern
about
the
trustees
and
the
work
they
have
to
do
to
meet
state
procedures.
justice
o'connor
how
about
a
state
tax
lien
on
the
employee's
benefits?
justice
o'connor
well,
ms.
mahoney,
congress
also,
though,
enacted
section
514,
and
that's
what
obviously
the
government
and
the
petitioner
are
relying
on.
and
in
the
process,
congress
also,
in
514(b)(7),
exempted
domestic
relations
orders
from
the
preemptive
effect
of
514(a).
now
why
would
it
have
done
that
if
it
didn't
think
it
had
prevented
in
514(a)
the
garnishment
pursuant
to
a
child
support
order,
for
example?
justice
o'connor
well,
aren't
most
of
these
domestic
relations
orders
from
an
errant
parent
collected
by
a
garnishment
order
if
there
are
some
funds
to
do
it?
justice
o'connor
and
isn't
that
legitimately
a
concern
of
congress
in
exempting
it?
justice
o'connor
but
it
may
also
affect
the
garnishment.
justice
o'connor
let
me
ask
you,
since
you
are
interrupted,
about
this
particular
georgia
law.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
terms
of
the
georgia
law,
even
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
the
scope
of
514,
we
would
still
have
to
reverse
because
the
georgia
supreme
court
was
certainly...
it
took
a
very
odd
view
of
the
effect
of
the
georgia
law,
didn't
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
didn't
involve
an
erisa
plan
though.
justice
o'connor
so
i
think
that...
unless
you
are
dealing
with
section
514,
that
probably
isn't
a
good
precedent.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
point
so
much
to
that
as
it
does
a
protection
of
the
benefits
themselves.
justice
o'connor
well,
they
may
have
done
more
in
514
with
their
"relate
to"
language.
that's
what
this
turns
on,
doesn't
it?
what
does
"relate
to"
mean?
