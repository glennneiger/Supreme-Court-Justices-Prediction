justice
white
so
suppose
that
you
are
right
that
this
law
does
relate
to
garnishment,
or
does
relate
to
the
plan.
that's
your
position?
justice
white
it's
preempted,
and
therefore
what?
justice
white
so?
justice
white
on
what
do
you
rely
for
that?
justice
white
all
right.
the
state
law
which
exempts--
justice
white
--all
right.
justice
white
--i
see.
i
take
it
you
are
defending
the
judgment
below
and
also
the
rationale?
justice
white
you
defend
every
step
in
that.
well,
that's
quite
wrong.
you
said
you
thought
the
statute
was
preempted,
the
georgia
statute
that
they
construed.
justice
white
the
georgia
court
did
say
that
this
state
was
preempted.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
then
it
went
on
and
did
what?
justice
white
because?
justice
white
i
thought
they
thought
that
erisa
affirmatively
permitted
garnishment.
justice
white
sort
of
a
negative
inference
from--
justice
white
--and
you
defend
that?
justice
white
well,
if
that's
so,
that's
all
the
court
below
needed
to
say.
if
the
erisa
affirmatively
intended
to
permit
garnishment,
a
state
should
not
be
able
to
except
it.
justice
white
well,
they
didn't
even
need
to
mention
514
then.
justice
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
filed
an
opinion
in
this
case
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
justices
blackmun,
o'connor
and
scalia
have
joined
that
opinion.
