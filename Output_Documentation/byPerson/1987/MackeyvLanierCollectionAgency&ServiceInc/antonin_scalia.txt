justice
scalia
how
about
state
laws
against
embezzlement?
i
mean
it
just
can't
possibly
mean
anything
that
has
an
effect
upon
the
fund.
you
mean
state
laws
against
embezzlement
do
not
apply
to
embezzlement
from
the
funds?
justice
scalia
civil
laws
of
general
application.
justice
scalia
what
about
civil
laws
of
general
application?
justice
scalia
so
there
could
be
no
civil
action
for
embezzlement
under
state
law?
justice
scalia
an
automobile
accident
caused
by
a
car
driven
by
an
employee
of
the
trust,
on
the
business
of
the
trust,
you
say
there
could
be
no
recovery
because
that
would
relate
to
erisa.
you
would
say
that.
justice
scalia
you
have
to.
justice
scalia
no?
all
right.
justice
scalia
well,
i
know
it's
not
your
case.
justice
scalia
so
we
are
just
arguing
about
whether
being
liable
for
garnishment
is
one
of
the
ordinary
things
that
any
employer
normally
engages
in.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
well,
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
all
i
am
pointing
out
is
you
really
just
can't
say
it's
simple
language
if
it
relates
to.
you
really
don't
mean
that.
i
mean
a
lot
of
things
will
relate
to
the
fund
in
the
sense
of
having
an
effect
upon
the
fund,
which
you
will
acknowledge
are
okay.
justice
scalia
you
can
have
fun
but
you
can't
die
laughing.
that's
the
doctrine
that
applies.
justice
scalia
that's
nice
for
this
case.
justice
scalia
it
won't
help
very
many
others,
will
it?
justice
scalia
there
are
likely
to
be
a
lot
of
these.
i
mean
there
are
a
lot
of
those
plans
and
they
involve
a
lot
of
money,
and
we
seem
to
be
getting
a
fair
amount
of
litigation
involving
this
issue
of
what
"related
to"
means
which
certainly
is
not
self-evident.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
think
would
be
a
line
of
more
general
utility?
justice
scalia
ms.
mahoney,
the
government
has
given
us
its
best
shot
at
a
general
rule
to
determine
what
"relating
to"
means.
what
is
yours?
what
is
the
general
rule
that
includes
this
case
and
also
helps
us
in
future
cases?
justice
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
procedure
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
creditor,
or
from
the
standpoint
of
the
debtor,
but
i
don't
know
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
garnishee
getting
an
order
from
the
court
is
a
procedure.
it's
no
different
from
a
tax
assessment,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
scalia
what
about
an
order
and
execution
of
judgment;
is
that
a
procedure?
justice
scalia
so
any
state
judgment--
justice
scalia
--so
long
as
you
can
get
a
judgment
in
state
court,
you
can
execute
it
against
the
erisa
trust.
