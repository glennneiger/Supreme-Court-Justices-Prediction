mr.
brian
j.
martin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
erisa,
in
general,
preempts
the
application
of
state
garnishment
laws
to
employee
benefit
plans.
our
view
is
also
based
on
514.
but
before
i
get
to
the
514
point,
i'd
like
to
respond
to
a
couple
of
points
of
justice
o'connor.
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
in
section
502
seems
to
us
to
mean
that
a
plan
may
be
sued
on
any
valid
federal
claim
or
non-preempted
state
claim.
it
does
not
override
the
preemptive
provision
of
514,
whatever
that
means.
and
with
respect
to
206(d)(1),
which
provides
that
pension
benefits
may
not
be
assigned
or
alienated,
we
do
think
there
is
a
bit
of
overlap
between
206
and
514.
but
we
think
that
to
conclude
it,
this
overlap
makes
much
more
sense
in
a
complex
erisa
statute
that
was
built
over
the
course
of
years
than
to
conclude
that
206,
by
addressing
pension
benefits
and
not
welfare
benefits,
silently
excluded
garnishment
of
welfare
benefits
from
514.
exclusions
from
514
are
in
514,
514(b)
in
particular.
justice
scalia
raises
the
obvious
question,
where
does
the
line
draw
in
514.
we
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
ways
to
answer
that
question.
one
rule
of
decision
would
be
a
state
law
that
determines
whether
plan
benefits
will
be
paid
to
a
plan
participant
is
a
law
that
relates
to
that
plan.
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
shaw
and
in
metropolitan
life
would
support
that
view.
in
those
cases
the
state
law
required
the
payment
of
benefits
in
the
cases
of
mental
illness
and
pregnancy.
another
possible
decision,
rule
of
decision
would
be
the
state
law
that
requires,
or
forbids
the
payment
of
benefits
is
preempted
if,
in
addition,
it
imposes
administrative
duties
on
the
trusties.
in
this
case
we
have
those
duties.
they
have
to
answer
a
garnishment
summons
within
45
days.
they
have
to
pay
over
the
funds
if
they
can
calculate
them
to
the
court.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
no,
no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
they
can
be
sued
for
zoning
violations
if
they
have
to
house
the--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--unpaid
rent,
all
of
these.
i'm
giving
examples
of
where
the
line
could
be
drawn.
one
that
determines
whether
benefits
will
be
paid
to
a
plan
participant
and
imposes
administrative
tasks
is
one
possible
line.
but
i
think
perhaps
the
narrowest
and
clearest
line
is
where
did
congress
draw
the
line.
and
we
know
from
an
amendment
to
erisa
in
1984,
the
retirement
equity
act
that
added
514(b)(7),
that
congress
thought
that
garnishment
laws
sufficiently
affect
erisa
plans
to
be
preempted.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
that
would
be
preempted
too
under
514(b)(7)
which
the
house
report
accompanying
the
bill
specifically
endorsed
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
franchise
tax
board
which
held
that
state
tax
levies
could
not
be
applied.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
514(b)(7)
is
an
exclusion
from
the
preemption
language
of
514(a).
it
allows
garnishment
in
the
case
of
domestic
relations
orders.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
from
pension
or
welfare.
it
codified
the
line
of
cases
that
had
held
that
there
was
an
implied
exclusion
from
514(a)
for
family
domestic
relation
orders
such
as
alimony
and
child
support.
in
1984,
congress
said,
well,
514(a)
may
have
swept
that
in
there.
we
don't
want
it
swept
in
there,
so
we
will
amend
the
statute.
but
in
amending
it,
they
made
clear
that
other
types
of
garnishments
would
continue
to
be
preempted.
so,
to
me,
perhaps
the
narrowest
and
most
clearest
way
to
decide
the
case
is
to
look
where
congress
drew
the
line
in
this
case.
we
know
that
garnishment,
but
for
domestic
relation
orders,
sufficiently
affects
the
plan
to
be
preempted.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
probably
not.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well,
it's
not
self-evident.
congress,
unfortunately,
left
it
to
this
court
to
draw
that
line
in
various
cases.
that
is
why
i
am
suggesting
that
at
the
state
level--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--a
state
law
that
determines
whether
the
trustees
will
pay
benefits
to
a
plan
participant
pursuant
to
the
plan
is
preempted,
tied
to
the
benefits
and
to
the
plan.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
the
next
sentence
adds--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--the
next
sentence
of
the
house
report,
"thus,
for
example,
the
committee
reasserts
that
a
state
tax
levy
on
employee
welfare
benefit
plans
is
preempted
by
erisa.
"
citing
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
franchise
tax
board.
in
the
senate
report,
which
unfortunately
i
don't
believe
is
cited
or
quoted
in
our
brief,
at
page
19
of
the
senate
report,
the
senate
finance
committee
says
that,
"only
those
orders
that
qualify
as
domestic
relation
orders
are
not
preempted
by
erisa.
"
so
i
do
think
that
in
other
provisions
of
the
committee
reports
make
it
clear
that
but
for
garnishment
of
domestic
relation
orders,
alimony,
child
support,
garnishment
laws
would
be
preempted.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
