ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
solicitor
general
and
the
petitioners
are
searching
for
a
line
on
how
to
interpret
section
514's
relate
to
language.
there
is
no
question
it's
a
difficult
task.
but
in
all
of
the
other
cases,
with
the
exception
of
franchise
tax
board
in
which
this
court
has
considered
the
preemptive
scope
of
section
514,
it
was
dealing
with
actions
which
were
brought
by
trustees
or
beneficiaries.
trustees
and
beneficiaries
are
provided
specific
remedies
under
section
502
of
the
act.
and
the
court
has
found
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
claims
by
beneficiaries
and
by
trustees
within
the
core
of
the
act,
that
all
state
law,
all
state
substantive
law
and
even
the
causes
of
action
are
preempted
because
those
are
within
the
core
of
erisa.
the
only
case
where
this
court
has
considered
the
scope
of
preemption
in
an
action
brought
by
a
party
not
covered
by
section
502,
such
as
a
creditor
of
the
fund
or
as
in
this
case,
a
creditor
who
seeks
garnishment
against
a
beneficiary,
was
franchise
tax
board.
and
in
that
case
this
court
specifically
drew
the
line
by
saying
that
erisa
was
not
intended
to
preempt
all
causes
of
action
by
third
parties
against
a
fund.
it
doesn't
speak
to
the
question
of
what
a
third
party's
remedies
against
the
fund
may
be.
instead,
it
says
that
the
causes
of
action
themselves
are
preserved,
but
the
substantive
law
that
will
be
applied
to
the
right
to
recover
has
to
be
consistent
with
federal
law
under
erisa.
so,
in
effect,
in
franchise
tax
board,
the
court
drew
a
line
and
said
the
action
to
enforce
the
tax
levy,
which
was
brought
by
the
state,
was
not
in
and
of
itself
preempted,
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
trustee
could
comply
with
that
remedy
had
to
be
answered
under
federal
substantive
law.
so,
in
effect,
this
court
has
said
that
while
a
conflicts
analysis
for
preemption
isn't
required
in
a
case
which
is
brought
by
an
beneficiary
or
by
a
trustee
within
the
realm
of
rights
covered
under
section
502,
it
is
required
when
it
is
an
action
which
is
brought
by
a
third
party
against
a
fund
for
remedies
which
are
collateral
to
the
substantive
purposes
of
erisa.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that
was
a
decision
of
your
court,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
in
that,
it
was
a
case
involving
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
action
which
was
brought
by
the
state
of
california
to
enforce
its
tax
levy
could
be
removed
to
federal
court
as
a
federal
question.
and
in
looking
at
that
question,
this
court
had
to
decide
whether
or
not
erisa
preempted
that
cause
of
action
in
its
entirety
such
that
it
couldn't
proceed
in
state
court.
and
the
court
very
explicitly
said,
we
don't
answer
the
question
of
whether
or
not
erisa
precludes
garnishment.
that's
a
question
that
has
got
to
be
answered
under
the
substantive
law
of
erisa.
in
other
words,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
trustee
should
comply
with
a
writ
of
garnishment
is
one
which
has
to
be
answered
under
common
law
principles
developed
by
this
court
pursuant
to
erisa.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
garnishment
action
that
has
been
brought
by
the
respondent
in
this
case
conflicts
with
the
substantive
law
of
erisa.
and
essentially
the
petitioners
in
the
united
states
maintain
that
it
conflicts
in
two
respects.
first,
they
say
it
conflicts
because
erisa
was
intended
to
prevent
any
creditor
from
ever
asserting
a
claim
for
garnishment
against
the
fund,
or
ever
attempting
to
alienate
the
benefits
in
favor
of
creditors;
that
that
was
a
substantive
protection
which
erisa
was
intended
to
provide
which
would
be
destroyed.
second,
they
maintain
that
erisa
was
intended
to
prevent
the
fund
itself
from
having
to
endure
the
burdens
of
garnishment.
with
respect
to
both
of
these
issues,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
there
simply
is
no
such
federal
purpose
under
erisa.
and
that
if
we
look
at
each
of
these
questions
separately,
it
becomes
apparent
why.
first,
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
congress
intended
to
protect
beneficiaries
in
all
welfare
plans
from
involuntarily
alienation
of
benefits,
we
look
first
to
what
erisa
says
on
this
subject.
under
section
206(d),
congress
very
explicitly
provided
that
pension
benefits
cannot
be
alienated,
can't
be
alienated
in
an
involuntary
or
a
voluntary
fashion.
and
when
it
did
that,
it
was
acting
against
the
backdrop
of
the
common
law,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
how
you
protected
benefits,
or
wages,
or
property
from
creditors
at
common
law
in
order
to
understand
the
significance
of
what
congress
did.
essentially
at
common
law
any
property
in
the
hands
of
a
third
party
could
be
alienated
in
favor
of
creditors
unless
it
had
been
donated,
placed
in
the
trust
and
the
trust
had
a
spendthrift
clause.
so
when
congress
came
to
this
problem
for
pension
benefits,
it
went
ahead
and
it
required
that
pension...
promises
to
pay
pension
benefits
have
to
be
funded,
they
have
to
be
placed
in
a
trust,
and
they
have
to
have
a
spendthrift
clause.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
the
domestic
relations
order
i
believe
was
done
for
a
very
different
purpose.
it
wasn't
directed
at
garnishment
per
se.
it
was
directed
at
the
substantive
law
question.
in
other
words,
what
the
exception
to
514
for
domestic
relations
order
does,
because
it
says
that
the
substantive
law
of
whether
or
not
a
wife
is
entitled
to
support
will
be
determined
under
the
state
law
of
domestic
relations
order.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
it
could
be--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
it
is,
except
that
the
domestic
relations
exception
does
something
much
broader
than
garnishment
itself.
it
actually
provides
that
the
plan...
that
the
issue
of
rights
to
benefits
is
to
be
decided
under
state
domestic
relations
law,
not
under
federal
law,
and--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it
certainly
may
affect
the
garnishment.
but
i
think
that
you...
that
the
exception
is
necessary
only
to
the
extent
that
it
affects
the
substantive
law.
and
that
in
this
case,
no
exception
to,
or
no
exemption
from
514
is
necessary,
because
federal
substantive
law
does
have
to
govern
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
trustee
is
obligated
to
comply
with
the
garnishment
order.
i
think
that
is
the
critical
difference,
and
that's
why
the
exception
for
domestic
relations
orders
shouldn't
be
read
to
just
mean
that
any
garnishment
has
to
be
approved
by
a
specific
exemption
to
the
section,
because
it
did
much
more
than
approve
garnishment
orders.
in
fact,
it's
not
even
clear
that
garnishment
orders
itself
are
within
the
specific
definition
of
domestic
relations
orders.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
you
are
referring
to
the
section
which
exempts
erisa
plans
from
garnishment?
i
think
that
the
section
which
exempts
erisa
plans
from
garnishment
has
to
be
preempted
by
section
514.
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
was
correct
in
that,
because
that
section,
its
only
purpose
is
to
regulate
erisa
plans.
in
effect,
what
the
exemption
does
is
it
says
trusts
in
the
state
of
georgia
have
valid
spendthrift
clauses
whenever
they
are
created
for
an
erisa
plan
beneficiary.
that
will
create
the
precise
disuniformity
which
congress
intended
the
preemption
clause
to
establish.
if
georgia
is
permitted
to
say
that
in
our
state
spendthrift
clauses
are
in
force,
then
there
will
not
be
a
uniform
substantive
law
governing
trust
administration
throughout
the
united
states,
and
that's
why
this
court
in
franchise
tax
board
said
that
the
question
has
to
be
answered
under
the
federal
common
law
developed
under
erisa
and
cannot
be
answered
under
state
law.
and
also,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
that
section
is
preempted,
the
rest
of
the
garnishment
laws
remain
in
tact,
and
the
remedy
can
proceed.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
i
don't
now
of
a
specific
case,
but
i
believe
that
the
general
principles
of
garnishment
that
were
applicable
in
georgia
would
have
permitted
this
garnishment
because
there
was
no
general
exception
for
benefits
of
any
type.
in
fact,
there
is
no
exception
for
vacation
benefits
that
are
not
in
an
erisa
fund
under
the
georgia
law.
so
there
is
no
indication
that
georgia,
independent
of
erisa,
would
have
wanted
to
protect
these
particular
kinds
of
benefits.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
know
of
no
such
case.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
here
is
that
the
specific
funds
are
vacation
funds.
and
ordinarily
garnishment
of
vacation
funds
occurs
just
in
the
ordinary
course
of
wage
garnishment,
because
the
vast
majority
of
american
workers
are
paid
vacation
pay
through
their
regular
wage
distributions.
and,
in
fact,
the
department
of
labor
has
found
that
vacation
pay
shouldn't
even
be
subject
to
erisa
except
to
the
extent
it's
placed
in
a
trust
fund,
because
congress
didn't
have
any
substantive
intent
to
protect
vacation
pay.
and
what
that
really
says
here
is
that
congress
must
not
have
intended
to
prevent
the
alienation
of
vacation
pay
in
favor
of
creditors.
otherwise,
all
vacation
pay
should
be
subject
to
erisa.
nor
can
it
be
said
that
there
is
a
good
reason
to
find
that
vacation
pay
should
be
protected
from
alienation
simply
because
it's
been
put
in
an
erisa
fund.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
it
cannot
be
garnished
until
that
point
in
time
either.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
right.
so,
in
other
words,
the
garnishment
works
precisely
the
same
way.
under
the
georgia
law,
the
creditor
is
not
entitled
to
obtain
that
vacation
pay
until
the
date
in
which
it
in
fact
can
be
paid
to
the
employee.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
and
when
it
garnishes
wages,
it's
not
entitled
to
the
wages
until
the
date
on
which
it
is
payable
to
the
employee.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
so
they
are
really
indistinguishable.
in
fact,
it's
just
happenstance
that
vacation
pay
is
in
a
trust
fund
in
this
case.
it
only
occurs
really
because
these
are...
it
is
an
industry
where
they
have
multiple
employers
during
the
year,
and
therefore
the
only
way
to
provide
vacation
benefits
is
through
a
trust
fund
of
this
type.
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
look
at
the
issue
of
vacation
pay
and
to
say
that
congress
had
an
affirmative
intent
to
make
sure
that
vacation
benefits
would
not
be
subject
to
claims
of
creditors.
in
fact,
it's
the
department
of
labor's
position
on
vacation
pay
by
adopting
a
regulation
which
takes
vacation
pay
outside
of
the
scope
of
erisa
is
the
best
evidence
of
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
provide
this
kind
of
substantive
protection
to
vacation
pay.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
the
general
rule
has
got
to
be
that,
first
of
all,
state
procedures
are
not
laws
that
relate
to
erisa
plans
even
though
they
might
burden
erisa
plans,
except
to
the
extent
they
are
in
conflict
with
the
substantive
requirements
of
erisa.
and
i
say
that
because
if
you
look
to
the
statute,
it
seems
very
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
preempt
state
procedures.
congress
preserved
concurrent
jurisdiction.
it
provided
certain
procedural
requirements
for
cases
brought
in
federal
court
which
it
did
not
impose
on
the
state
courts
hearing
the
same
actions
such
as
service
of
process
and
venue.
and
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
procedure
that's
in
issue
here,
procedures
in
aid
of
execution
of
judgments,
there
simply
are
no
federal
procedures
in
aid
of
execution
of
judgments.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
it's
more
like
a
subpoena.
it's
been
defined
as
a
procedure
under
rule
69.
it
is
a
writ,
that's
what
it
is.
it
has
been
defined
as
a
procured
under
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
which
governs
garnishment,
and
even
in
the
rules
enabling
act
that
gives
this
court
the
power
to
adopt
federal
rules,
it
says
rules
of
procedure
include
writs.
so
i
do
think
that
it
is
a
procedure.
it's
much
like
a
subpoena.
when
the
trust
fund
obtains
a
subpoena
to
come
and
testify
and
bring
records,
it
is
very,
very
burdensome,
and
nobody
likes
getting
them,
but
certain...
and
it
certainly
burdens
the
plan
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
garnishment
writ
burdens
the
plan.
but
i
don't
think
that
514
was
meant
to
totally
displace
all
of
the
judicial
remedies
which
are
used
in
both
state
and
federal
courts.
and
essentially
i
don't
think...
it
doesn't
serve
to
adjudicate
liability.
it
only
serves
to
take
liability
which
is
already
established.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
judgment
itself.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
that's
correct
except
to
the
extent
that
it
would
contravene
the
substantive
provisions
of
erisa.
i
mean
that's
what
franchise
tax
board
does
very
explicitly,
and
says
that
you
have
to
look
to
see
whether
or
not
a
third-party
remedy
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
substantive
law
governing
erisa.
and
i
think
that's
where
the
line
has
got
to
be.
if
it
conflicts
with
the
purposes
of
erisa,
if
erisa,
for
instance,
was
intended
to
preclude
alienation,
then
certainly
it
is
preemptive.
but
unless
erisa
in
fact
intends
to
preclude
alienation,
or
intends
to
prevents
burdens
on
plans,
plans
themselves,
then
i
do
not
think
that
it
can
be
preempted.
there
has
to
be
a
conflict
with
the
substantive
law
of
erisa
before--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor.
well,
the
procedure
would
be
in
force,
but
there
would
be
no
right
to
recover.
in
other
words,
if
someone--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
correct.
there
would
be
no
liability.
sure,
he
would
have
to
respond,
because
i
just
don't
think
514
can
be
viewed
as
something
which
simply
displaces
all
of
the
incidents
of
the
judicial
process,
and
garnishment
summons...
the
answer
would
be,
we're
not
liable
because...
or
we
don't
have
to
turn
this
over
to
you
because
congress
said
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
do
so,
and
that
is
a
perfectly
valid
answer
which
would
have
to
preempt
any
state
answer
to
the
country.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor,
i
would.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
it
is.
under
rule...
you're
talking
about
execution
of
judgments,
i
assume.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
oh,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
provided
for
under
rule
69.
whether
you
call
garnishment
a
procedure,
which
rule
69
does
call
it,
or
whether
you
say
that
it
in
fact
is
a
creditor's
remedy,
the
answer
should
be
the
same.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
in
this
case
i
do,
because--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
they
are
different.
they
are
asking
for
something
different.
but
when
they
ask
for
the
money,
they
are
not
attempting
to
adjudicate
liability
on
the
part
of
the
fund.
we're
talking
about
a
liability
which
is
established,
a
liability
that
is
due
not
to
the
garnishee
but
rather,
to
the
beneficiary.
and
the
only...
the
significance
of
the
writ
of
garnishment
is
it
says
instead
of
paying
over
the
money
you
owe
to
the
beneficiary,
you
pay
25
percent
of
it,
in
the
case
of
wages,
over
to
us.
it's
very
similar
to...
it's
equivalent--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--to
the
person
with
the
money,
it
is
a
procedure,
yes.
the
trust
doesn't
dispute
that
the
monies
are
owed
to
the
beneficiary,
and
it
discharges
their
liability
to
the
beneficiary.
they
just
claim
that
it's
burdensome
to
have
to
do
it
just
as
it
is
burdensome...
i
mean
their
complaint
is
not
about
having
to
give
the
money.
it's
about
the
fact
that
they
have
to
go
through
the
burdens
attendant
to
garnishment,
and
that's
an
argument
that's
been
rejected
by
this
court
before.
in
fha
v.
burr,
the
federal
agency
said
we
can't
be
subject
to
garnishment
for
our
employees'
wages
because
it's
too
burdensome.
it
requires
us
to
process
these
claims,
and
the
court
said,
no,
that
is
an
important
part
of
the
judicial
process
unless
congress
expressly
says
you
are
relieved
from
that
burden.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
it
didn't.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
the
reason
that
i
think
it
is
a
good
precedent
is
because
it
says
that
garnishment
is
viewed
as
a
normal
incident
of
the
judicial
process.
and
unless
you
are
immune
from
suit,
or
unless
congress
expressly
says
you
are
not
subject
to
garnishment,
you
are.
and
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
514,
it
really
can't
be
construed
as
an
expressed
direction
that
no
garnishment
can
be
permitted,
and
that's
why
i
think
that
the
case
in
fact
is
very
much
on
point.
why
is
it
that
the
trust
funds
are
exempt
from
garnishment?
is
it
because
it's
simply
a
burdensome
procedure?
well,
if
so,
then
why
aren't
they
also
exempt
for
a
subpoena
directing
them
to
produce
all
their
records
and
come
and
testify?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
okay,
that
is
a
very
different
question.
to
the
extent
that
congress
intended
to
protect
the
benefits
from
alienation,
there
is
no
question
that
the
substantive
federal
law
has
to
govern.
i
do
not
think,
though,
that
erisa
reflects
an
intent
to
protect
the
beneficiaries
from
alienation
of
vacation
benefits.
congress
knew
how
to
protect
benefits.
they
knew
that
they
needed
to
put
them
in
a
trust
fund,
and
they
needed
to
have
a
spendthrift
clause.
that's
what
they
did
for
pension
plans.
but
they
didn't
do
it
for
welfare
benefits.
they
didn't
require
them
to
be
funded.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor,
except
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
"relate
to"
language
should
be
construed
to
apply
to
a
third-party
action
when
congress
didn't
even
address
the
question
of
what
remedies
would
be
available
to
third
parties.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
really
any
different
than
let's
say
a
cause
of
action
by
an
accountant
for
breach
of
contract
against
the
fund.
that
would
require
the
fund
to
pay
out
monies
that
otherwise
could
be
paid
to
beneficiaries
if
they
were
held
liable,
and
there
is
no
federal
creation
of
a
cause
of
action
for
such
creditors.
nevertheless,
it
would
relate
to
the
fund
in
the
same
way
that
garnishment
relates
to
the
fund.
but
i
can't
believe
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
all
third-party
actions,
and
that
really
was
the
essence
of
the
holding
in
franchise
tax
board.
was
that
for
those
remedies
that
congress
doesn't
speak
to,
remedies
by
parties
other
than
trustees
and
beneficiaries,
they
are
preserved
except
to
the
extent
they
are
inconsistent
with
the
federal
substantive
law
under
erisa.
and
so
we
are
back
to
the
question,
the
key
question
in
this
case
of
whether
or
not
congress
intended
to
prevent
the
alienation
of
vacation
benefits.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
correct.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
franchise
tax
board
i
think
is
critical
to
the
analysis
here,
because
in
franchise
tax
board
the
state
brought
an
action
to
collect
on
its
tax
levy
in
state
court.
they
did
it
under
a
state
cause
of
action.
the
trustees
of
the
plan
that
were
sued
removed
the
case
to
federal
court,
and
the
question
which
was
ultimately
decided
by
this
court
was
whether
or
not
the
removal
was
proper.
and
they
found
that
they
had
to
answer
two
questions
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
removal
was
proper.
the
first
was
whether
or
not
that
cause
of
action
raised
a
federal
question
on
its
face.
and
the
answer
given
was
it
does
present
a
federal
question.
the
federal
question
is
whether
or
not
the
trustees
are
obligated
to
comply
with
the
levy.
but
that
is
raised
by
way
of
defense.
therefore,
it's
not
removable
under
the
well
pleaded
complaint
rule.
but
the
looked
to
a
second
question,
and
that
was
whether
or
not
it
was
removable
because
the
cause
of
action
itself
was
preempted
in
its
entirety
by
erisa.
and
the
court
said
it
was
not.
this
court
said
that
erisa
does
not
speak
to
the
question...
in
fact,
it
says
that
erisa
neither
creates
nor
expressly
denies
any
cause
of
action
in
favor
of
state
governments
to
enforce
tax
levies
or
for
any
other
purpose.
it
doesn't
purport
to
reach
every
question
relating
to
plans
covered
under
erisa.
and
it
found
that
the
action
to
enforce
a
levy
is
not
itself
preempted.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
correct.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
i
believe--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
i
think
you
are
correct.
i
think
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
position.
i
don't
have
a
reason
to
say
that
it
is
different.
the
only
thing
i
could
say
is
that
when
congress
looked
at
the
franchise
tax
board
opinion,
that
opinion
didn't
consider
whether
or
not
the
substantive
law
of
erisa
could
be
used
to
prevent
garnishments
which
were
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
erisa.
and
it
may
well
be
that
if
congress
had
understood
the
issue
in
that
fashion,
they
wouldn't
have
found
that
garnishment
should
be
precluded,
because
they
may
have
been
concerned
that
garnishments
could
occur
even
where
plan
benefits
should
not
be
subject
to
alienation.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
they
had,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
they
had
been
allowing
them.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
but
they
found
an
implied
exception
essentially.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
don't
think
that
those
cases
are
particularly
germane
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
non-domestic
relations
orders
can
be
enforced
against
a
plan
or
not
though.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
a
moot
case.
they
still
very
much
would
like
to
have
the
monies
collected,
but
they
simply
didn't
want
to
invest
anymore
monies
in
the
case.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
yes,
that
is
correct.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
section
of
the
georgia
statute
which
purports
to
provide--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
correct,
but
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
the
georgia
court
simply
said
that
that
section
of
the
georgia
law
which
purports
to
provide
an
exemption
from
garnishment
is
preempted,
and
it
didn't
go
into
detail
in
looking
at
what
else
there
was,
but
they
affirmed
the
order
of
garnishment,
so
they
presumably
found
that
the
rest
of
the
statute
remained
in
tact,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
analysis.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
they
said
that
the
section--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor,
they
did.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
it
went
on
and
upheld
the
garnishment
orders--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--because
the
rest
of
the
statute
was
not
preempted
and
the
garnishment
was
consistent
with
erisa.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
they
did.
in
other
words,
they
found
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
the
inference
which
i
think--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--oh,
absolutely;
oh,
absolutely.
i
think
that
erisa
very
much
intended
to
permit
creditors'
remedies
against
welfare
plans,
particularly
in
the
case
of
benefits
such
as
vacation
pay.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
correct.
i
believe
that
is
what
the
georgia
supreme
court
said.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
i
think
they
mention
514
in
that
that
is
the
expressed
preemption
clause.
so
to
that
extent,
but
you
are
right,
it
would
be
preempted
even
if
there
were
not
an--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--expressed
preemption
clause.
but
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not...
i
really
think
that
the
key
question
here
is
whether
or
not
there
is,
under
this
court's
power,
to
create
common
law
of
trusts,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
policy
reason
in
favor
of
preventing
the
alienation
of
vacation
benefits
held
in
a
fund.
