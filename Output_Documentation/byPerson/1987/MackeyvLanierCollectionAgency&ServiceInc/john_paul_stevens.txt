justice

i
have
to
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
questions
if
i
may.
supposing
the
fund
doesn't
have
enough
money
to
pay
its
rent.
they
lease
an
office
to
operate
the
fund;
it's
a
small
fund.
could
they
be
sued
in
state
court
and
invade
the
fund
to
pay
the
rent?
justice
stevens
well,
why
is
that
different?
justice
stevens
but
your
language
is
still
the
same,
and
the
garnishment...
you
rely
entirely
on
514,
don't
you?
justice
stevens
what
they
seek
to
garnish
in
this
case,
these
were
vested;
these
were
not
contingent
benefits.
these
were
vacation
benefits.
justice
stevens
but
under
the
plan
when
would
they
have
gotten
it
if
they
weren't
garnished?
justice
stevens
tell
me
again
what
is
514(b)(7)
and
where
is
it?
justice
stevens
like
from
pension
plans.
justice
stevens
is
the
legislative
history
as
clear
as
you
describe
it?
what
you
are
relying
on
is
what's
quoted
on
page
18
of
your
brief,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
"the
committee
emphasizes
that
except
as
expressly
provided
nothing
in
the
bill
is
intended
to
limit
or
otherwise
change
the
original
broad
intent
behind
erisa's
rule
of
preemption.
"
"that
intention
has
always
been
to
preempt
state
or
local
government
laws
or
actions
of
any
type
which
directly
or
indirectly
relate
to
any
employment
benefit
plan.
"
what
does
that
tell
us
about
garnishments?
justice
stevens
that
just
repeats
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
do
you
happen
to
know
if
prior
to
the
enactment
of
erisa
going
back
in
the
early
days
in
georgia,
and
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
particular
statute
that
you
just
say
is
preempted,
the
one
relating
to
erisa,
would
the
garnishment
been
appropriate
in
georgia
of
a,
just
say
there
was
a
state-administered
plan
like
this?
justice
stevens
do
you
happen
to
know
if
there
is
any
reported
cases
in
georgia
of
garnishments
of
these
funds,
you
know,
just
normal
state
trusts?
justice
stevens
it
sounds
strange
to
me.
i
was
just
thinking
back
in
my
own
practice.
i
don't
remember
garnishing
trust
funds
like
this
even
before
erisa
was
enacted.
justice
stevens
well,
you
get
two
kinds
of
vacation
pay.
some
just
pay
the
regular
salary
when
an
employee
is
on
vacation
and
that,
of
course,
would
be
subject
to
garnishment
if
he
just
got
his
salary.
but
if
you
put
it
in
a
fund,
it's
not
payable
until
the
employee
accrues
the
amount
that
would
be
distributed
when
he
gets
his
vacation,
he
or
she
gets
his
vacation.
justice
stevens
well,
of
course
not,
because
there
is
no
vested
interest
in
it
until--
justice
stevens
--right.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
clarify
one.
i
think
i
know
the
answer,
but
i
want
to
be
sure.
you
do
agree,
do
you
not,
that
if
this
were
a
pension
plan,
you
could
not
garnish
the--
justice
stevens
--and
you
emphasized
the
fact
that
welfare
plans
and
pension
plans
are
treated
differently
under
the
statute.
justice
stevens
but
then
in
franchise
tax
board,
it
was
a
welfare
plan,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
then
how
to
you
explain
that
case?
justice
stevens
but
then,
as
i
remember
the
legislative
history
the
government
cites
on
(b)(7),
refers
to
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
franchise
tax
board.
justice
stevens
now
was
that
before
our
decision?
what's
the
timing
on
that,
or
do
we--
justice
stevens
--see,
that
seems
inconsistent
with
your
position,
or
am
i
missing
something?
justice
stevens
before
the
(b)(7)
amendment,
had
the
courts
been
allowing...
in
alimony
and
child
support
cases,
had
they
been
allowing
collections
from
pension
trusts
as
well
as
welfare
trusts?
justice
stevens
they
had.
justice
stevens
which
was
really
inconsistent
with...
normally
thought
to
be
inconsistent
with
that
spendthrift--
justice
stevens
can
you
refresh
my
recollection
on
one
other
thing?
why
isn't
the
respondent
defending
the
case
itself?
why
were
you
appointed?
this
isn't
a
moot
case
is
what
i
wanted
to
be
sure--
justice
stevens
you
say
you
don't
rely
on
that
statute.
you
rely
on
the
general
garnishment
statute.
justice
stevens
so
that's
a
very
different
argument
than
the
georgia
court
made.
