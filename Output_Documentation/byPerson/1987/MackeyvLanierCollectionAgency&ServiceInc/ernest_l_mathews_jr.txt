mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
extent
to
which
the
employees
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974,
erisa,
preempts
state
garnishment
laws.
the
petitioner
is
a
longshoreman's
vacation
and
holiday
fund
which
is
an
employee
benefit
fund,
a
welfare
fund
governed
by
erisa.
the
case
arose
when
a
collection
agency
in
georgia,
the
respondent
lanier
collection
agency,
attempted
to
garnish
the
vacation
and
holiday
benefits
of
23
longshoremen.
they
brought
a
proceeding
in
the
county
court
of
chatham
county,
georgia.
in
the
decision
under
review,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
that
while
the
state
garnishment
procedures
were
not
preempted
as
applied
to
erisa
welfare
funds,
the
exception
in
the
georgia
statute,
which
removed
from
the
effects
of
garnishment
welfare
funds,
was
preempted
as
being
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
erisa.
the
real
issue
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me,
is
whether
congress
means
what
it
says,
because
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
expressed
preempt
section,
section
514
of
erisa,
which
says
that
any
state
law
that
relates
to
an
employee
benefit
plan
is
preempted,
so
there
is
no
need
to
psychoanalyze
congress
or
to
go
into
legislative
history.
it
is
right
there
plain
and
simple
in
the
statute.
and
the
words
"relate
to"
have
been
construed
by
this
court
in
a
unanimous
decision
which
has
been
relied
on
in
five
different
cases
with
no
change
from
the
definition
that
relate
to
as
the
ordinary,
common
sense
dictionary
meaning.
if
something
relates
to
something,
if
it
has
an
effect
on
it,
it
has
reference
to
it,
it
has
a
connection
with
it.
so
really
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
when
you
have
an
attempt
to
garnish
these
funds,
does
the
state
garnishment
law
have
an
effect
upon
the
funds.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
congress
anticipated
your
question,
justice
scalia,
because
erisa
expressly
removes
from
its
preemption
section
state
laws
of
general...
criminal
laws
of
general
application.
so
embezzlement
is
a--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--criminal
laws.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
congress
does
not
remove
that.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
no,
there
could
not.
and
i
think
that's
similar
to
a
case
that
this
court
had
where
the
beneficiaries
of
the
fund
tried
to
bring
a
common
law
action
against
the
trustees,
and
this
court
held,
no,
they
were
limited
to
the
remedies
provided
in
erisa.
i
think
there
would
be
a
remedy
in
erisa
if
there
were
embezzlement
by
the
trustees,
but
it
wouldn't
be
a
state
common
law
embezzlement
action.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
i--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--i
don't
think
i
have
to.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
i'm
not
sure.
i
mean
that's
not
our
case,
but
i'm
not
sure
because
i
think--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
congress
obviously
intended
that
these
erisa
plans
function.
and
if
they
are
going
to
function
in
the
real
world,
they
are
going
to
have
to
hire
employees,
they
are
going
to
have
to
rent
premises,
you
know,
rent
a
xerox
machine,
what
have
you.
and
nobody
is
going
to
work
for
them
if
they
can't
sue
them
for
their
wages,
and
no
one
is
going
to
rent
property
or
rent
space
to
them
if
they
can't
evict
them
if
they
don't
pay.
so
i
think
congress
must
have
intended
that
the
ordinary
liabilities
that
someone
has
entering
into
any
business
would
apply
to
the
erisa
fund.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
and
if
this
case
were
a
garnishment
about
a
fund
employee,
i
might
even
agree
that
that
is
not
preempted.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
but
this
is
a
garnishment
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
fund.
i
mean
our
fund,
for
instance,
well,
it
really
doesn't
have
any
paid
employees.
but
if
it
did,
it
would
have
two
or
three.
here
they
have
got
3,000
of
which
23
in
one
bunch
are
being
garnished,
and
in
the
year
1984,
109
garnishments
were
filed.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes.
but
i
would
say
is
that
those
state
laws
would
be
preempted
were
it
not
for
the
doctrine
that
the--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--no,
the
federal
laws
should
not
be
impaired
in
their
work.
and
the
doctrine
in
shaw
v.
delta
airlines
case,
that
they
are
sort
of
revived
when
they
are
necessary
to
accomplish
the
ends
of
a
federal
statute.
one
of
the
ends
of
erisa
is
to
have
plans
work,
and
so
i
would
say
it's
a
revival,
but
that
514
still
would,
without
that
concept
of
revival,
would
preempt
them.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes,
there
is.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
i
believe
it
has.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
if
we
were
looking
for
an
implied
intent
of
congress,
i
might
agree
with
your
honor.
but
congress
has
told
us
what
it
meant.
it
said
all
state
laws
relating
to.
we
don't
have
to
delve
for
congress's
intent
and
do
it
by
extrapolation
that
sue
and
be
sued
is
part
of
functioning,
or
is
expressly
allowed.
congress
said
if
it
relates
to,
and
certainly--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--that
is
true,
but
206(d)
in
its
specific
terms
deals
with
the
voluntary
alienation
of
pension
funds.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
there
has
been
a
gloss
on
the
statute
by
the
courts
that
that
would
also
cover
involuntary
alienation.
that
is
true.
but
206
says
nothing
about
welfare
plans.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
historically
speaking,
they
passed
206(d)
before
they
passed
514.
at
the
time
that
206(d)
was
drafted
there
was
a
much
less
pervasive
preemption
provision
in
the
house
and
senate
drafts
of
erisa
than
in
the
conference
that
come
up
with
the
514
which
got
to
the
relation
that
relate
to
the
standard.
so
i
think
that
would
explain
it
to
some
extent.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
i
would
have
said
that
probably
before
i
did
the
research
in
this
case.
but
doing
the
research,
i
think
it's
substantive
law.
i
think
it
creates
rights
and
liabilities
where
none
existed
before.
that
is,
the
right
against
the
holder
of
the
funds
as
opposed
to
against
the
judgment
debtor,
and
i
think
that's
substantive
law.
so
i
wouldn't
put
it
just
in
the
matter
of
procedure.
there
are
a
lot
of
procedures
connected
with
it,
and
that's
part
of
the
problem
that
the
fund
faces
is
that
you
have
got
funds
that
have
four
different
states
involved,
and
they
all
have
different
procedures.
and
georgia
has
a
particularly
noxious
procedure
in
that
you
have
got
to
appear
like
a
defendant,
appear
by
attorney,
file
an
answer,
update
it
every
45
days
if
you
haven't
paid
up
everything,
and
really
get
involved
with
the
legal
process.
a
state
like
new
york,
you
simply
file
it
on
the
garnishee
and--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--well,
again,
your
honor,
you
are
going
to
an
implied
preemption
analysis
in
trying
to
psycho
analyze
congress.
i
am
not
just
saying
let's
do
what
congress
said.
they
said
does
it
relate
it,
and
i
think
that
in
the
real
world
you
cannot
say
it
does
not
relate
to
when
it
makes
the
trustees
pay
out
the
benefits
differently
than
the
trust
funds
says,
when
it
puts
them
to
administrative
burdens
of
appearing
in
court,
when
it
puts
them
to
a
large
expense,
because
in
every
one
of
these
things
they
have
got
to
hire
a
lawyer.
and
i
figure
in
the
course
of
filing
the
updates
and
everything,
that
lawyer
has
to
put
in
an
hour's
time
in
the
course
of
a
year.
so
you
are
figuring
about
$100
per
garnishment.
we
have
over
109
garnishments
in
one
year
alone.
that's
money
out
of
the
fund.
and
congress
itself
has
recognized
in
another
connection,
the
consumer
protection
act,
that
state
garnishment
laws
do
have
an
impact.
they
have
made
it
a
crime
with
a
$1,000
fine
and
a
year
in
jail
for
an
employer
to
fire
somebody
because
his
salary
has
been
garnished.
why
do
they
do
it?
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
tell
us
because
it
was
such
a
burden
on
the
employers
that
they
would
rather
fire
somebody
than
pay
the
garnishment.
in
the
same
statute
there
is
a
finding
that
the
state
garnishment
laws,
the
discrepancies
and
differences
in
them
have
made
the
uniform
application
of
bankruptcy
law
impossible.
and
uniformity,
as
we
know,
is
another
one
of
the
congressional
purposes
in
erisa--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--i
think
they
could.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
because
that
is
necessary
to
the
functioning
of
the
fund
or
of
anybody
else
who
goes
into
business,
and
i
think
it's
impliedly
revived
by
congress's
intention
that
there
be
funds.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
entirely.
i
think
514
says
what
it
says.
it's
very
clear
what
it
says.
this
court
has
said
what
it
means.
does
it
have
an
effect
on
the
plan?
it
does
have
an
effect
on
the
plan
and
therefore
it's
preempted.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
well,
they
wouldn't
get
them
until
they
were
due
and
owing.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
in
georgia,
it
would
be
the
end
of
the
year.
so
like
december
31st
they
get
all
their
holidays
and
all
their
vacation
for
the
previous
year
if
they
have
qualified
for
vacation
and
holiday
benefits.
that's
what
i
say
about
the
45-day
renewal.
if
they
get
served
with
a
garnishment
in
january,
every
45
days
they
have
got
to
go
up
and
say,
we
don't
owe
them
anything
yet
until
we
get
to
december
31st.
and
then
they
come
in
and
they
say,
and
now
we
owe
it
to
them,
and
here's
the
money.
so
it's
an
ongoing
thing
which
plan
has
to
refer
to
our
office,
and
an
attorney
has
to
work
on
them.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
it's
preempted.
it
is
null
and
void.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
erisa
plans
may
not
be
garnished
under
state
garnishment
procedures.
now
what
happens
is
that
when
the
money
gets
paid
over
to
the--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
--well,
the
statute
is
null
and
void
if
it
is
preempted.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
no,
i
said
the
state
law
which
permits
garnishment
is
null
and
void,
because
it
relates
to
the
plans.
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
might--
mr.
ernest
l.
mathews,
jr.
your
honor,
obviously
ms.
mahoney
and
i
are
in
sharp
disagreement,
but
i
think
the
lines
are
well
drawn,
and
i
don't
think
i
have
to
take
any
more
time
of
this
court.
