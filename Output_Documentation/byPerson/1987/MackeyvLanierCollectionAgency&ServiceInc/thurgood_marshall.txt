but,
counsel,
i
have
trouble
with
this
word
"procedure".
that
when
you
take
all
of
my
money,
that
is
the
procedure.
justice
marshall
i
guess
you
call
execution
a
procedure.
justice
marshall
that's
a
procedure?
justice
marshall
i
said
executions.
justice
marshall
well,
do
you
see
a
difference
between
the
procedure
of
asking
you
to
testify
and
the
procedure
of
taking
your
money
away
from
you?
do
you
think
they
are
both
procedures,
right?
justice
marshall
they
are
a
little
different,
though,
aren't
they?
justice
marshall
you
mean
as
to
the
person
with
the
money,
it's
just
a
procedure.
