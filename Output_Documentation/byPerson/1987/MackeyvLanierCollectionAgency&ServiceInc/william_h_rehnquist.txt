rehnquist
mr.
mathews,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mathews.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
martin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
true
any
time
you
allow
the
trustees
to
be
sued
under
state
law.
they
are
going
to
have
to
hire
a
lawyer.
they
are
going
to
have
to
file
an
answer,
that
sort
of
thing.
but
you
are
not
saying
that
no
legal
action
based
on
the
state
law
can
ever
be
brought
against
the
trustees,
are
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
unpaid
rent,
justice
scalia's
example.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
martin.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
mahoney.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
mahoney,
was
the
franchise
tax
board
decision
to
which
you
refer,
was
that
decision
of
our
court
or
of
the
ninth
circuit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
our
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
then
that
even
if
erisa
would
provide
that
you
can't
get
a
hold
of
these
vacation
benefits,
nonetheless,
the
garnishment
process
would
be
in
force?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
that
would
mean
the
trustee
would
have
to
answer
not
that
you
can
never
garnish
the
trust,
but
that
there
is
no
liability
on
the
trust
in
this
case.
we
hold
nothing
that
you
can
get
by
garnishment
process.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mahoney.
mr.
mathews,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mathews.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-1387,
mackey
against
lanier
collection
agency
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
