justice
jr.
may
i
ask?
justice
jr.
you
said
that
there
ought
under
no
circumstances
in
any
context
be
a
defense...
contractor
defense?
justice
jr.
even,
for
example,
if
the
government
has
required
by
order,
compelled,
the
building
of
a
helicopter
precisely
in
the
shape
this
was
in?
justice
jr.
what
you
are
telling
me
is
when
this
helicopter...
it
was
not
time
of
war,
i
gather.
justice
jr.
yes,
but
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is,
to
understand
your
position,
it
is
that
no
matter
what
the
circumstances,
that
the
manufacturer
may
build
the
helicopter
even
if
they
are
given
all
the
plans
and
all
the
design
and
everything
else
by
the
government
and
said,
"do
it
this
way.
"
"no
other
way.
"
they
still
do
not
have
a
defense?
justice
jr.
then
i
gather
your
answer
to
me
is,
yes,
that
is
your
position?
