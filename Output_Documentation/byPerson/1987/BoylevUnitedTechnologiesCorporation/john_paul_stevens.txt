justice
stevens
now,
you
are
saying
that
is
a
position,
i
take
it,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
there
is
no
such
defense.
would
it
not
be
possible
that
as
a
matter...
i
guess
this
is
a
case
applying
virginia
tort
law;
is
it?
justice
stevens
is
it
not
possible
that
virginia
might
recognize
a
defense
on
behalf
of
a
defendant
who
was
just
obeying
orders
and
didn't
do
anything
independently?
justice
stevens
no,
but
if
you
are
suing
on
a
design
defect,
it
certainly
would
be
open
to
the
manufacturer
to
say,
"i
didn't
design
it.
"
"somebody
else
designed
it;
namely,
the
united
states
navy.
"
or
whatever
it
is.
that
would
be
a
defense;
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
i
take
it
the
unique
doctrine
is
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
make
rules
for
the
regulation
of
the
army
and
the
navy?
justice
stevens
that
was
the
claim
against
the
united
states?
justice
stevens
i
know
it
isn't
disputed
by
petitioner,
but
why
isn't
something
congress
could
settle
much
more
easily
than
we
could:
define
the
proper
terms
to
this
act.
justice
stevens
well,
which
is
the
more
capable
law
making
entity
in
this
particular
area?
justice
stevens
the
question
the
federal
court
created
liabilities--
justice
stevens
--none
of
them
are.
justice
stevens
i'm
sorry.
you
are
right.
there
are
a
lot
of
those.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
case
cuts
against
you.
justice
stevens
that
was
a
condemnation
case.
the
claim
there
was
that
there
was
condemnation.
the
defense
was
then
you
remedy
is
against
the
united
states.
that
is
entirely
different.
justice
stevens
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
did
you
argue
that
there
was
any
such
defense
as
a
matter
of
virginia
law?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
many
of
those
cases
arise
under
section
1983,
their
construction
with
federal
statute
which
presumptively
adopted
common
law
rules
that
were
applied,
not
just
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
but
general
common
law.
justice
stevens
well,
most
of
those
against
federal
officials,
the
question
really
comes
down
to
whether
there
is
an
implied
cause
of
action
against
the
federal
official.
justice
stevens
and
in
your
clearfield
case,
which
of
course
is
the
principal
example,
the
united
states
was
a
party
to
that
case--
justice
stevens
--who
would
you
say
is
better
competent
to
draw
the
appropriate
rules
in
this
area,
in
the
military
procurement?
congress
or
this
court?
justice
stevens
that
is
not
my
question.
justice
stevens
which
do
you
think
is
better
able
to
do
the
job?
justice
stevens
surely,
you
don't
want
us
to
decide
every
case.
you
want
us
to
lay
down
some
broad
general
principles.
don't
you?
