if
there
had
been
an
authoritative
construction
of
the
government
contractor
defense
that
occurred
between
the
trial
and
the
appeal,
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
been
foreclosed
from
ordering
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
the
right
rule
of
law?
justice
white
well,
isn't
that
what
you
were
just
arguing?
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
you
would
say
that
the
fourth
circuit
could
not
give
the
benefit
of
the
correct
rule
of
law
to
a
person
who
had
approved
the
instruction.
is
that
it?
is
that
sort
of
an
estoppel?
justice
white
i
know.
but
assume
it
was
right.
assume
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
right.
justice
white
all
right.
but
the
court
could
have
granted
a
new
trial
anyway?
justice
white
based
on
the
correct
rule,
even
though
your
opposition
had
approved
the
instruction.
justice
white
you
have
to
refer
a
federal
law.
you
have
to
say,
"this
is
a
defense
that
we,
the
courts,
hold
as
required
by
federal
law.
"
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
we
are
saying
it
is
federal
law.
justice
white
and
you
would
say
this
even
though
the
state,
under
state
law,
there
would
be
no
such
a
defense?
justice
white
standard
oil
was
a
case
in
which
the
court
first
held
that
the
issue
is
one
that
should
be
controlled
by
federal
law.
but
then,
rather
than
fashioning
the
novel
remedy,
the
court
said,
"it
is
up
to
congress
because
they
are
much
better
equipped
than
we
are
to
make
the
rules.
