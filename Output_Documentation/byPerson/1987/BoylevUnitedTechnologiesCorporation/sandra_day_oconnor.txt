o'connor
or
yearsley?
what
about
clearfield
trust?
what
about
yearsley?
justice
o'connor
well,
all
the
courts
of
appeal,
without
exception,
who
have
addressed
it,
have
recognized
some
form
of
government
contractor
defense;
have
they
not?
justice
o'connor
no
court
of
appeals
has
just
totally
rejected
it,
as
you
would
have
us
do?
justice
o'connor
well,
they
have
all
accepted
a
defense.
justice
o'connor
there
are
different
formulations
of
it.
you
are
here
saying,
"don't
recognize
any
government
contractor
defense
at
all.
"
justice
o'connor
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
congress
could
always
step
into
the
act.
if
this
court
recognized
a
government
contractor
defense,
obviously,
congress
can
come
in
and
grant
immunity
or
make
adjustment
if
it
sees
fit.
justice
o'connor
well,
that
is
perhaps
because
congress
doesn't
know
what
our
court
would
have
to
say
about
whether
it
exists
or
doesn't
exist.
we
have
never
spoken
on
the
issue.
justice
o'connor
well,
maybe
the
government
contractor
defense
should
not
be
limited
to
the
military.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
isn't.
it
depends
on
how
it
is
formulated
because
the
general
contract
specification
defense
typically
available
in
state
tort
law
would
extend
perhaps
only
to
specifications
that
are
very
precise
and
not
necessarily
to
the
kind
of
situation
that
may
have
been
involved
here
where
the
contractor
participates
in
the
design
or
for
a
performance
type
specification.
justice
o'connor
i
suppose
though
that
you
do
have
the
kind
of
situation
where,
perhaps,
the
government
wants
to
design
some
exotic
product
and
doesn't
know
how
to
do
it
itself
and
might
want
to
rely,
at
least
in
part,
on
the
expertise
of
the
private
industry.
justice
o'connor
there
certainly
is
a
difference,
rather
sharp
difference
of
opinion
in
the
courts
below
as
to
the
shape
that
such
a
defense
should
take.
its
contours.
justice
o'connor
well,
if
it
is
a
performance
type
specification
or
a
situation
where
the
contractor
participates
with
the
government
in
designing
the
product,
is
there
a
duty
of
the
contractor
to
warn
of
defects
that
it
knows
or
should
know
exist?
justice
o'connor
are
government
contractors
permitted
to
include
costs
of
getting
liability
insurance;
do
you
know?
justice
o'connor
and
then
it
could
be
incorporated
in
the
price?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
is
it
at
bottom?
a
separation
of
powers
argument?
justice
o'connor
how
about
hazards
they
should
know
of?
justice
o'connor
even
if
it
doesn't
meet
general
industry
standards?
