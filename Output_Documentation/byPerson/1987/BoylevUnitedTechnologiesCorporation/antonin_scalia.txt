justice
scalia
why
isn't
the
overriding
federal
question
the
ability
of
the
federal
government
to
determine
the
incidence
of
federal
contracting
which
include
not
just
the
rights
between
the
government
and
the
contractor,
but
the
extent
to
which,
on
the
basis
of
this
contract,
the
private
contractor
can
be
held
liable
to
a
third
party.
so,
in
other
words,
clearfield
trust
is
what
brings
us
into
all
of
this.
just
because
a
state
chooses
to
eliminate
the
doctrine,
the
old
doctrine
of
the
necessity
of
privity
of
contract
before
any
defect
in
the
product
can
be
sued
upon,
just
because
a
state
chooses
to
eliminate
it,
the
federal
law
of
contracts
does
not
necessarily
eliminate
it.
justice
scalia
why
is
it
based
on
feres,
necessarily?
you
have
been
calling
it
the
government
contractor
defense,
not
the
defense
contractor
defense?
justice
scalia
oh,
i
think
the
policy
considerations
are
the
ability
of
the
government
to
determine
the
incidence
of
government
contracts...
of
a
government
contract.
now,
you
have
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
an
immunity
that
is
retained
for
the
government
with
respect
to
discretionary
functions.
justice
scalia
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
goes
down
the
tube
once
you
say
that
although
the
government
can't
be
sued,
whenever
the
government
buys
anything
from
a
contractor,
as
it
universally
does,
especially
in
the
military
field,
the
government
can
end
up
paying
the
bill
indirectly
because,
although
the
discretionary
function
can't
be
brought
home
to
the
government,
it
can
to
the
contractor.
the
contractor's
price
goes
up.
it
is
just
the
same
as
if
we
didn't
have
that
provision
in
the
tort
claims
act.
why
isn't
that
a
federal
policy
that
is
served,
quite
apart
from
feres.
justice
scalia
can
i
ask
about
the
space
shuttle
thing.
your
position
is
that
if
the
government
had
produced
that
shuttle,
itself,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
suit
possible
because
the
engineering
defect,
whatever
it
was,
would
clearly
come
within
the
discretionary
function
provision
of
the
tort
claims
act;
right?
justice
scalia
i
thought
that
was
a
broad
view.
justice
scalia
this
isn't
in
the
execution
of
a
rule
or
regulation.
it
is
an
engineer
sitting
down
saying,
"what
is
the
best
way
to
do
this?
"
if
that
isn't
a
discretionary
call,
i
really
don't
know
what
is.
anyway,
assume
that
that's
covered,
you
would
say
that
even
though
be
government
couldn't
be
sued,
if
the
government
contracts
with
someone
else
to
do
the
same
job
and
participates
actively
in
designing
it
with
that
person,
then
the
government
can't
be
sued,
but
the
other
person
can
be
sued?
justice
scalia
oh,
well,
then
you
are
acknowledging
a
government
contractor
defense
but
you
say
it
only
applies
when
the
government
has
actively
participated.
justice
scalia
no,
but
if
a
third
party
is
injured--
justice
scalia
--if
a
third
party
is
injured
and
i
have
cooperated
in
the
design
of
that
car,
it
seems
to
me
i
would
be
suable;
wouldn't
i?
justice
scalia
the
third
party
assumes
the
risk?
justice
scalia
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
justice
scalia
first,
though,
mr.
lacovara,
you
are
going
to
insist
on
calling
it
the
military
contractor
defense,
although
you
want
it
expanded
to
cover
all
contractors,
and
your
opponent
insists
on
calling
it
the
government
contractor
defense,
although
he
would
limit
it
if
it
exists
at
all
to
military
contractors,
just
as
long
as
we
have
our
terminology
in
mind,
i
guess
we
can
live
with
it.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
what
if
the
helicopter,
by
reason
of
some
other
defect,
in
the
rotor,
for
example,
falls
down
and
hurts
some
civilians?
justice
scalia
no.
a
design
defect
in
the
rotor.
justice
scalia
no,
it
was
before
the
military
department,
too.
justice
scalia
same
as
here.
everything
is
the
same
as
here,
only
it
is
the
rotor
and
it
hurts
a
civilian
instead
of
a
serviceman.
justice
scalia
what
field
do
you
think
we
are
better
at
making
law
than
the
congress
is?
i
mean
you
say
here
the
congress
is
better.
where
are
we
better?
justice
scalia
anywhere?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
or
maybe
your
defense
that
says
a
federal
employee
can't
be
sued
under
state
tort
law
for
activities
in
the
discharge
of
his
federal
functions.
we
made
that
one
up;
didn't
we?
justice
scalia
why
would
we
make
up
that
one
and
not
this
one?
which
ones
do
you
want
us
to
get
into
and
which
ones
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
first
of
this,
boyle
versus
united
technologies
corporation
comes
to
us
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
david
boyle,
a
united
states
marine
helicopter
pilot,
drowned
when
his
helicopter
crashed
off
the
coast
of
virginia
during
a
training
exercise.
petitioner,
the
representative
of
boyle's
estate,
brought
this
suit
in
district
court
alleging,
under
virginia
law,
that
respondents,
sikorsky
division
of
united
technologies,
manufacturer
of
the
helicopter,
had
defectively
designed
the
emergency
escape
hatch
system.
the
jury
returned
a
general
verdict
in
favor
of
petitioner
and
awarded
him
$725,000.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
sikorsky
could
not
be
held
liable
for
the
allegedly
defective
design
because
it
had
satisfied
the
requirements
of
what
the
court
referred
to
as
the
military
contractor
defense.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
such
defense
exists
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
its
proper
scope.
we
reject
petitioner's
broadest
contention
that
there
is
no
justification
in
federal
law
for
shielding
government
contractors
from
liability
for
design
defects
in
military
equipment.
we
have
in
the
past
recognized
that
in
a
few
areas
involving
uniquely
federal
interests,
state
law
is
preempted
and
replaced
where
necessary
by
federal
law
even
in
the
absence
of
an
explicit
statutory
directive
so
providing.
we
hold
today
that
the
procurement
of
equipment
by
the
united
states
is
an
area
of
uniquely
federal
interests
and
that
a
suit
such
as
the
present
one
directly
implicates
that
interest.
still,
as
we
have
said
in
the
past,
state
law
will
be
displaced
in
a
situation
such
as
this
only
where
it
significantly
conflicts
with
the
federal
interest.
we
think
such
a
conflict
exist
where
state
tort
law
seeks
to
impose
a
duty
contrary
to
that
established
by
a
federal
procurement
contract
and
where
the
design
specified
in
that
contract
represents
the
type
of
governmental
judgment
that
congress
sought
to
immunize
through
the
discretionary
function
exemption
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
we
further
hold
that
the
selection
of
the
appropriate
design
for
military
equipment
is
the
type
of
discretionary
function
that
will
require
the
displacement
of
state
law.
petitioner
also
challenges
the
scope
of
the
defense
recognized
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
today
that
liability
for
design
defects
in
military
equipment
cannot
be
imposed
pursuant
to
state
law
when,
(1),
the
united
states
approved
reasonably
precise
specifications,
(2),
the
equipment
conformed
to
those
specifications,
and
(3),
the
supplier
warned
the
united
states
about
the
dangers
and
the
use
of
the
equipment
that
were
known
to
the
supplier
but
not
known
to
the
united
states.
finally,
petitioner
claims
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
not
remanding
for
a
jury
trial
on
the
basis
of
the
elements
of
the
defense
announced
in
its
decision.
because
we
find
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
somewhat
unclear
regarding
whether
it
believe
that
the
elements
of
the
defense
were
established
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
remand
for
clarification
on
this
point.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
joined.
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
