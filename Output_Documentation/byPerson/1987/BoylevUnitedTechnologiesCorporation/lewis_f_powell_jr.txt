justice
jr.
who
assumes
the
risk?
i
mean
somebody
who
is
not...
let's
assume
somebody
who
is
not
in
the
government
is
hurt,
does
he
assume
the
risk?
i
don't
understand.
justice
jr.
take
this
hypothetical:
suppose...
imagine
the
days
when
the
post
office
was
actually
a
government
agency
and
the
post
office
buys
a
whole
bunch
of
right-hand
drive
vehicles
so
he
can
put
the
stuff
in
the
mailboxes.
now,
that
is
obviously
a
dangerous
place
to
have
the
steering
wheel.
right?
it
is
apparent.
the
government
orders
it,
though.
an
accident
occurs
with
a
private
vehicle
on
the
street
and
the
manufacturer
who
made
these
defective
vehicles
with
right-hand
drive
is
sued
by
the
person
who
is
hurt
by
the
accident.
that
manufacturer
has
no
defense?
justice
jr.
if
the
state
chooses
to
allow
such
a
suit.
justice
jr.
oh,
yes,
it
is
negligent
to
drive
on
the
right
side
of
a
vehicle.
