mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
april
27,
1983
one
and
a
half
miles
off
the
virginia
coast,
a
young
marine
helicopter
pilot
and
chaplain
was
killed
in
the
crash
of
a
sikorsky
ch53d
helicopter.
the
helicopter
crashed
into
the
sea
due
to
the
negligent
design
and
subsequent
repair
of
the
steering
mechanism
of
that
sikorsky
helicopter.
as
the
helicopter
sank,
lt
david
boyle
drowned
because
his
escape
system
was
defectively
designed
and
did
not
function.
and
in
the
murky
water,
he
was
unable
to
use
another
escape
route.
this
case
was
tried
to
a
jury
verdict
in
favor
of
appellant,
where
the
jury
was
charged
with
a
form
of
the
government
contractor
defense,
a
form
of
the
government
contractor
defense
specifically
approved
by
defense
counsel
on
the
record
at
the
joint
appendix
page
450
at
the
trial.
respondent
did
not
object
pursuant
to
rule
51
to
that
jury
charge
on
the
government
contractor
defense.
also,
the
trial
judge
was
not
requested
nor
did
he
give
a
jury
charge
of
the
virginia
logan
burden
of
proof.
respondent
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit,
but
respondent
did
not
challenge
the
government
contractor
defense
as
given
by
the
trial
judge
in
the
trial
jury
charge.
however,
the
fourth
circuit
sua
sponte
reversed
the
jury
verdict
based
on
(1)
the
logan
case
in
virginia,
and
(2)
based
on
a
new
version
of
the
government
contractor
defense
just
articulated
on
the
same
day
in
the
fourth
circuit
case
of
tozer.
now,
in
this
court,
we,
the
appellant,
ask
that
the
jury
verdict
be
reinstated.
we
further
ask
and
point
out
the
sikorsky's
only
response
is
an
unsupportable
government
contractor
defense
and
a
disagreement
with
the
sanctity
of
the
jury
verdict.
appellant,
therefore,
asks
this
court
to
decide
on
this
first
impression
several
issues.
they
are:
(1)
was
the
jury
verdict
correct
and
should
it
be
reinstated.
appellant
contends
that
it
was
correct
and
it
should
be
reinstated.
(2)
was
the
appellant's
seventh
amendment
rights
of
a
right
to
jury
trial
violated
by
the
fourth
circuit
by
the
fourth
circuit
announcing
law
that
was
not
given
to
the
jury
and
then
applying
that
law
to
the
facts
without
the
benefit
of
a
jury
trial.
appellant
contends
that
the
seventh
amendment
right
were
violated.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
certainly
not,
justice
white.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
what
i
am
arguing,
however,
is
that
there
was,
in
fact,
a
form
of
the
jury...
correction:
of
the
government
contractor
defense
in
fact
given.
in
fact,
it
was
the
agent
orange
jury
instruction
was
given
to
the
trial
court
and,
specifically,
mr.
booker,
who
sits
at
respondent's
table,
here
specifically
approved
that
particular--
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
--i
am,
of
course,
arguing
that
the
fourth
circuit's
interpretation
of
what
it
feels
was
the
correct
of
rule
of
law
was
incorrect.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
in
that
way,
i
believe
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
seventh
amendment
right
not
to
have
remanded
the
case
back
down
for
a
jury
trial
based
on
the
law
just
announced
by
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
yes,
it
could
have.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
absolutely.
the
third
issue
that
i
would
ask
this
court
to
decide
is
should
there
be
a
government
contractor
defense
in
any
form?
it
is
the
appellant's
contention
that
based
on
several
reasons,
law
and
congressional
intent
that
there
should
not
be
a
government
contractor
defense
enacted
in
the
circuits
and
in
the
federal
common
law.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
yes.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
if
you
will
look
at
also
the
reply
brief,
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
reply
brief
does
address
this
particular
issue
specifically.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
that
is
correct.
the
reply
brief
by
the
appellant
does
address
this
particular
issue.
and,
in
fact,
you
do
beg
the
question
that
on
the
fourth
issue
that
i
ask
this
court
to
decide
is
if
this
court,
by
a
majority
rule,
decides
that
a
form
of
the
government
contractor
defense
should
be
enacted,
what
form
should
that
take?
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
correction.
adopted.
now,
addressing
the
first
issue--
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
--yes,
justice
brennan.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
i
believe
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
first
of
all,
of
course,
justice
brennan,
it
must
be
looked
at
to
determine
whether
or
not
it...
was
time
of
war
or
some
national
emergency
where
congress
has
specifically
acted
and
said,
"this
is
what
we
have
to
do.
"
however,
the
government
contractor
defense
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
civil
question
and,
in
most
cases,
is
dealing
with
a
item
of
equipment
which
has
not
been
procured
for
specific
time
of
war
application.
in
fact,
as
even
says--
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
--it
was
built
in
1968
in
an
undeclared
war
in
vietnam,
i
believe.
however,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
also
that
the
defect
that
was
alleged--
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
--i
believe
the
answer
is
the
question,
the
basic
question
to
the
government
contractor
defense
is:
does
the
government
truly
know
what
it
is
buying.
in
other
words,
if
they
were
given
the
plans
and
the
specifications
as
you
say--
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
--that
is
my
position.
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
it
was
tried
under
virginia
tort
law,
justice
stevens.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
it
is
entirely
possible
that
that
could
be
an
interpretation
in
the
individual
states.
however,
i
would
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
our
system
of
tort
law
under
negligent
strict
liability
and
breach
of
warranty
already
covers
all
of
the
elements
that
are
already
contained
within
this
proposed
government
contractor
defense.
so,
all
the
various
states
already
have
it,
as
well
as
the
system
of
federal
law.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
that
is
a
central
issue
of
the
government
contractor
defense
but
it
comes
back
to
whether
or
not
the
government
truly
was
informed
or
truly
had
the
knowledge
that
it
was
buying
a
defective
product
and
what
that
defect
was.
in
that
case,
then
it
would
be
appellant's
position
that
the
government
does
have
the
right
to
buy
it
and
it
would
be
a
form
of
assumption
of
the
risk,
if
you
will.
so,
they
could
accept
it
under
those
circumstances.
but
there
are
several
steps
that
have
to
be
taken.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
no,
he
does
not.
and
that
is
also
part
of
the
central
problem
with
this
whole
government
contractor
defense,
justice
scalia.
a
person,
who,
as
we
know
under
the
law...
a
civilian
can
easily
sue
a
government
contractor
if
he
is
riding
in
a
military
aircraft
or
a
military
product.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
that
manufacturer--
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
--first
of
all,
that
manufacturer
has
every
defense
that
is
afforded
to
them
under
negligent
strict
liability
and
breach
of
warranty.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
but
the
point
is
they
can
then
show
that
the
government
in
fact
said,
"that
is
where
i
want
that
steering
wheel.
"
"i
specifically
want
it
that
way,
therefore,
here
it
is.
"
and
that
is
why
the
contractor
builds
it
that
way.
that
comes
under
negligence.
the
contractor
isn't
negligent
if
it
followed
the
government's
specific
request.
strict
liability,
also
the
test
would
be
applied:
did
the
contractor
warn
the
government
of
all
of
the
inherent
risks
of
the
right-hand
drive
so
that
the
government
can
make
an
intelligent
choice.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
yes,
it
was
diversity.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
it
was
by
agreement
because
the
aircraft
crashed
within
one
and
a
half
miles,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
did
not
apply.
so,
virginia
law
applied.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
no,
we
are
reviewing
here,
i
believe,
the
whole
issue
of
the
government
contractor
defense.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
only
because--
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
--i
answer
that
it
was
the
federal
law
as
announced
by
the
various
circuits
prior
to
this
case
in
articulating
the
government
contractor
defense.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
source
of
the
federal
law
goes
back
to
the
agent
orange
case
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
in
the
mckay
v.
rowell
out
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
they
go
back
historically
to
the
yearsley
case
which
came
out,
i
believe,
in
1940,
which
was
a
question,
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question
where
the
government
specifically
formulated
construction
plans
for
a
dam.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
because
they
evidently,
the
circuit
courts
feel
that
there
is
an
overriding
federal
interest
involved
here
because
the
sikorsky
helicopter
was
a
federal
product...
correction:
it
was
a
contractor
who
sold
it
to
the
federal
government.
it
was
a
marine
who
was
killed
in
this
particular
crash
and
we
had
an
overriding
question
of
other
circuits
which
had
announced
forms
of
the
government
contractor
defense
and
the
trial
judge
believed
that
a
government
contractor
defense
should
be
given.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
in
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
--this
case,
none.
feres/stencel
doctrine
would
be
the
only
one--
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
--would
be
the
only
one
that
would
start
getting
close
to
it.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
yearsley
may.
i
think,
though,
the
feres/stencel
doctrine
is
actually
a
closer
articulation
in
modern
times
of
what
the
actual
question
is.
in
yearsley,
there
was
such
a
specific
compulsion
by
the
government
to
build
the
particular
dam
a
specific
way,
that
the
contractor
had
absolutely
no
discretion,
assuming
he
didn't
do
it
negligently.
and,
in
fact,
he
didn't
do
it
negligently.
the
dam
failed.
and
he
said,
"well,
the
government
told
me
to
build
it
that
way.
"
that
is,
in
a
sense,
an
extension
of
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
under
the
government
contractor
defense,
but
the
feres/stencel
doctrine
seems
to
be
the
overriding
policy
question
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
as
to
whether
or
not
a
serviceman
has
the
same
rights
as
you
and
i
do
if
they
are
using
a
defective
product
that
is
not
in
a
combat
situation
in
time
of
war.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
that
is
also
true,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
is
a
good
point.
i
think,
however,
it
comes
back
to
the
question
of
whether
we
have
a
judiciary
question
here
or
whether
we
have
a
congressional
or
legislative
question.
and
that
seems
to
be
because
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
heard
the
government
contractor
defense
as
to
on
what
basis
it
should
be
construed.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
i
think
that
there
have
been
various
rejections
of
forms
of
it
and
that
seems
to
be
the
main
issue,
here.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
yes.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
that
is
correct.
and
i
think
that
there
are
ample
reasons
why
it
should
not
be
a
form
of
any
defense.
it
is
already...
and,
of
course,
the
first
thing
that
should
be
questioned
is:
does
this
court
want
to
extent
feres/stencel
doctrines
of
a
special
relationship
of
the
military
to
contractors
and
such
that
a
military
person
cannot
sue
a
contractor
and,
if
they
do
sue,
are
they
met
with
a
special
defense?
in
other
words,
a
special
defense
for
a
special
class
of
people.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
it
seems
to
be
the
closest
analogy
that
we
have
come
to
in
our
research
to
try
to
understand
what
policy
considerations
are
to
be
or
should
be
considered
by
the
court.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
yes.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
without
addressing
the
discretionary
function
portion
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
there
are
several
empirical
evidence
that
has
been
brought
forth
in
my
briefs
regarding
the
fact
that
the
cost
factor
is
not
really
an
issue.
for
instance,
congress,
we
believe,
has
the
purview
to
enact
whatever
it
may
want
with
regard
to
military
suits
against
contractors.
they
were
presented
with
all
of
these
cost
arguments
in
1984
in
the...
i
think
it's
section
794
of
a
procurement
act
cited
in
my
briefs.
the
congress
rejected
those
arguments
and
in
essence
said,
"yes,
there
might
be
a
slight
increase
in
the
cost
of
the
various
products,
but
what
has
happened
in
the
past
is
is
that
we
have
bought
tremendously
expensive
products
and
they
haven't
worked
because
they
weren't
designed
right
in
the
first
place.
"
"isn't
it
better
to
spend
a
little
more
in
the
testing
and
the
design
in
the
first
place
than
it
is
to
spend
the
billions
down
the
line
to
repair
it?
"
i
give
you
an
example
like
the
shuttle,
which
is
a
good
example
of
it.
that
was
a
specific
design
by
morton
thiokol,
which
we
lost
not
only
a
billion
dollars
in
a
orange
puff
of
smoke,
we
also
lost
a
second
billion
dollars
when
we
have
to
replace
the
shuttle
and
350
million
dollars
to
redesign
the
booster,
let
alone
seven
lives.
that
was
poor
design
in
the
first
place.
and
that,
we
believe,
and
is
appellant's
position
that
it
is
congress'
decision
as
to
how
and
what
procedure
it
should
have
with
regard
to
its
procurement
process.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
that
is,
of
course,
correct.
i
would
also
point
out
that
congress
has
not
enacted
a
government
contractor
defense.
congress
has
also--
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
--that
is
perhaps
correct,
however,
i
think
congress
has
given
a
lot
of
indications
of
how
it
feels.
for
instance,
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
the
only
exception
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
applies
to
military
people
specifically
is
that
a
military
person
cannot
sue,
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act...
correction,
the
exception
of
the
combat
situations.
other
than
that,
they
have
every
other
right
to
sue
the
government.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
that
is
a
question,
of
course,
that
the
respondents
are
asking
you
to
reach
that
point.
however,
i
again
point
out
to
the
court
that
every
element
in
the
government
contractor
defense
is
still
contained
within
every
element
of
negligence,
strict
liability,
and
breach
of
warranty
which
applies
across
the
board.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
that
is
entirely
possible
and
that
is
correct,
that
there
is
that
element
of
how
much
participation
was
there.
however,
by
sanctifying
a
government
contractor
defense,
you
are
saying
that
it
is
the
government
that
holds
the
ultimate
expertise
in
the
procurement
process
rather
than
the
private
contractors
who
hold
out
their
expertise
for
profit
and
who
are
supposedly
the
ones
who
have
been
building
the
particular
product.
remember,
we
are
talking
about
products
that
go
all
the
way
from
refrigerators
to
missiles,
from
jets
to
beans:
everything.
52,000
procurement
contracts
a
day
by
some
of
the
statistics
i've
read.
that
we
are
going
to
be
talking
about
a
defense
all
across
the
board.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
absolutely.
and
i
think
that
that
is
already
covered
by
the
existing
law
under
negligence,
strict
liability,
et
cetera.
it
is
a
question
of
if
you
look
at
whether
or
not
the
government
knows
specifically
what
it
is
purchasing.
if
it
is
specifically
purchasing
a
specific
defect.
what
we
find
in
these
cases
on
the
practical
sense
is
we
find
nut
and
bolt
defects,
not
exotic
defects,
as
such.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
no,
i
don't
agree
with
that
particular
narrow
view
of
the
discretionary
function
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
well,
in
the
sense
that...
in
the
sense
that
certainly
there
is
discretionary
function
to
provide
by
the
government
certain
rules
and
regulations;
however,
it
has
been
the
interpretation
that
the
execution
of
those
rules
and
regulations
is
not
precluded
by
the
discretionary
function.
now,
i
grant
you,
of
course,
there
is
a
gray
area.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
that
is
correct.
and
part
of
the
defense
would
be,
even
under
the
basic
law
now
in
place,
is
to
show
whether
or
not
it
was
the
government
who
specifically,
knowledgeably
said,
"this
is
what
we
want,
even
though
it
is
a
defect.
"
like
your
example
of
the
right-hand
drive,
or
whether
the
government
just
rubber
stamped
a
design
submitted
by
the
contractor.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
it
applies
in
any
other
context
of
any
other
contract.
if
you
or
i
go
down
and
buy
a
ford
automobile
off
the
show
room
floor,
we
are,
in
essence,
contracting
saying,
"we
are
accepting
that
product".
now,
i
may
be
a
mechanic
or
an
engineer
and
i
may
have
superior
knowledge,
but
if
those
brakes
fail,
just
because
i
approve
the
purchase
of
that
contract
doesn't
mean
i
don't
have
the
right
to
be
able
to
sue
back
because
of
the
defect
design
of
ford.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
yes.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
if
you
had
participated,
then
it
is
covered
under
assumption
of
the
risk,
which
is
not
a
government
contractor
defense
but
an
existing
negligence,
strict
liability
test
in
the
various
circuits
or
in
the
various
states.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
well,
no,
not
the
third
party.
of
course,
the
third
party
could
then
sue...
perhaps
could
sue
you
depending
on
your
participation,
of
course.
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
yes.
the
issue
here,
however,
is
that
we
have
a
military
person
suing
a
government
contractor.
there
isn't
a
third
party,
necessarily.
he
is
employed
by
the
government
and
that
is
where
the
feres/stencel
starts
coming
in
as
to
whether
or
not
he
can
or
cannot
incident
to
military
service
sue
further
on
while
he
is
using
a
government
product.
it
is
a
very
thorny
issue.
i
would
like
to
reserve,
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it
has
become
abundantly
clear
at
this
point
that
the
central
issue
here
is
a
policy
decision.
it
is,
of
course,
appellant's
view
that
if
congress
wished
to
enact
a
government
contractor
defense
or
a
defense
specific
for
government
contractors,
it
could
do
so.
and
it
has
declined
to
do
so
despite
hearing
these
same
arguments
that
have
been
put
forth
by
the
solicitor
general
and
as
well
as
mr.
lacovara
and
in
other
legislation
that
has
worked
itself
around
this
issue.
i
think
it
should
be
reminded
to
the
court
that
we
are
talking
here
about
a
special
defense
for
special
people.
and
it
is
appellant's
view
that
this
is
especially
wrong.
what
would
you
be
asked
next?
to
enact
a
stock
broker
defense?
or
an
auto
maker
defense?
or
every
sector
of
our
american
industrial
complex
that
has
a
special
type
of
area
of
product:
airplane,
automobile,
boat,
will
start
going
into
specific
rules
for
those
specific
manufactures.
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
yes,
i
believe
you
did.
and,
of
course,
congress
also
enacted
a
specific
exclusion
under
federal
employees
benefits
act,
but
also
under
the
veterans
benefit
act,
congress
said
there
is
no
exclusivity.
there
is
nothing
implied--
mr.
louis
stanton
franecke
--if
we
did
not
have
any
system
of
law
that
already
applied
to
this
type
of
a
case,
of
a
military
person
suing
a
government
contractor,
i
would
say
then
we
would
probably
have
to
start
interpreting
where
we
are
going.
but
we
already
have
negligence.
we
already
have
product
liability.
we
already
have
breach
of
warranty.
all
of
these
defenses
are
available
to
united
technology
sikorsky
to
prove
that
supposedly
the
government
approved
this
one
particular...
or
these
defects
in
this
helicopter.
in
the
actual
record
in
this
case,
there
was
not
one
military
person
that
testified
at
the
trial
and
said,
"we
approved
the
escape
system.
"
"we
approved
the
specific
defect
in
the
control
system.
"
that
did
not
exist
in
this
record.
and
the
military
has
not
said
that
in
this
particular
case.
and
i
would
also
again
point
out
to
the
court
that
a
jury
heard
all
the
evidence,
including
the
defendant's
position
on
the
facts
and
found
for
the
appellant,
despite
even
a
version
of
the
government
contractor
defense
having
been
given.
and
i
also
think
that
it
is
important
that
if
your
honors
are
inclined
to
adopt
a
form
of
the
government
contractor
defense,
there
are
a
multitude
of
issues
that
have
to
be
balanced
because
this
defense
would
apply,
then,
throughout
the
entire
military
procurement
process.
and
congress,
instead
of
wanting
something
of
this
nature
has
in
fact
in
1984
been
enacting
legislation
that
has
made
the
government
procurement
complex
even
more
competitive
and
have
been
trying
to
disassociate
themselves
with
the
close
symbiotic
relationship
between
the
government
and
the
contractors
to
create
more
of
an
actual
competition.
thank
you.
