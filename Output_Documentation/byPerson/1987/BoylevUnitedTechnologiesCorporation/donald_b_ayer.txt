mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
is
in
this
case
as
amicus
because
we
believe
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
courts
or
the
military
should
decide
the
appropriate
standard
of
operator
safety
in
sophisticated
military
weapons
systems.
we
also
believe
that
this
may
be
the
paradigmatic
federal
common
law
case
under
the
clearfield
trust
doctrine
because
of
the
uniquely
federal
interest
which
we
are
dealing
with
here.
we
are
dealing
with
the
national
defense
and
the
ability
of
the
united
states
government
and
the
military
to
procure
sophisticated
weapons
systems.
the
analogy
that
i
think
is
closest
in
terms
of--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
necessarily,
your
honor.
and
i
would
agree
with
mr.
lacovara's
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
on
that
point.
these
are
balancing
questions,
we
must
confess.
and
in
that
sense,
we
think
the
closest
area
of
legal
doctrine
in
terms
of
an
analogy
is
the
area
of
federal
employee
immunity.
in
that
instance,
you
are
talking
about
protecting
the
general
functioning
of
the
government
and
that
is
an
area
where
this
court
has,
for
years
and
years,
dealt
with
cases
involving
questions
of
whether
the
balance
of
the
interests
of
defending
the
government
functioning,
outweigh
the
interests
of
the
plaintiffs
in
that
particular
situation.
i
think
in
those
cases,
it
has
been
clear
that
the
common
law
approach
has
been
the
appropriate
approach.
it
has
been
clear
to
this
court
in
case
after
case.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
many...
a
number
of
cases
also
have
not
dealt
with
constitutional
principles
or
1983.
they
have
dealt
with
common
law
actions.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
that
true.
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that
is
correct.
but
we
believe
that
the
overriding
the
priority
on
making
sure
that
the
united
states
government
and,
particularly,
in
the
context
of
military
procurement
and
the
involvement
in
the
national
defense,
that
that
is
a
priority
that
has
got
to
be
considered
whether
the
united
states
is
a
party
or
not.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
certainly,
they
both,
i
think,
are
competent.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
in
terms
of
case
by
case--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
in
terms
of
stating
general
principles,
it
is
arguable
that
it
would
be
more
appropriate
for
congress
to
do
it.
on
the
other
hand,
given
the
fact
that
cases
are
going
to
be
coming
up
with
various
factual
situations
that
are
not
susceptible
to
treatment
within
a
precise
rule,
it
seems
the--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--we
would
like
you
to
decide
this
case
and
state
a
principle
which
is
suitably
narrow
to
deal
with
this
case.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
now,
prior
to
any
decision?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
they
would
certainly
view
themselves
as
free
to
change
the
law
as
it
now
exists
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
they
would
certainly
be
aware
that
courts
around
the
country
are
applying
such
a
defense.
so,
in
terms
of
the
practical
reality,
that
defense
does
exist.
this
court
would
not
have
spoken
unless
they
might
feel
that
the
issue
had
been
finally
resolved.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
would
qualify--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
there
are
situations,
justice
scalia,
where
case
by
case,
adjudication
is
absolutely
unavoidable.
and
we
believe
that
this
is
such
an
area.
and
we
believe
that
the
fundamental
necessity
of
allowing
the
government
to
proceed
in
the
area
of
sophisticated
weapons
systems
by
the
kind
of
cooperative
relationship
with
private
industry
that
is
involved
in
this
case
that
that
priority
makes
it
possible
to
say
that
the
defense
that
we
are
talking
about
is
really
inherent
in
the
power
that
has
been
conferred
on
the
defense
department
and
the
services
to
go
forward
with
procurement.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
it
is
arguably
separation
of
powers.
i
think
maybe
preemption
is
a
little
closer,
justice
o'connor.
the
idea
that
the
power
of
the
government
to
get
weapons
systems
without
itself
manufacturing
all
of
them
is
a
power
that
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
is
inherent
in
the
power
to
provide
for
the
national
defense.
and
that
is
really
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
we
are
talking
about
complex
changing
technology
where
it
is
not
practical
for
all
sorts
of
reason
for
the
united
states
government
to
set
up
factories
to
manufacture
this
equipment
which
changes
every
few
weeks.
and
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
to
enlist
the
assistance
of
private
industry
in
doing
that.
now,
the
absence
of
a
defense
does
not
absolutely
prohibit
that,
but
it
creates
burdens
which
were
alluded
to
by
justice
scalia,
quite
correctly:
burdens
which
include
increasing
cost,
which
include
delays
in
the
ability
to
get
the
product
produced
because
the
contractor
is
focusing
not
only
on
what
the
government
wants
but
what
state
courts
in
their
tort
law
application
responsibility
are
demanding.
the
biggest
problem
that
is
generated
is
the
incentive
that
is
created
to
not
go
forward
with
a
cooperative
relationship
with
the
government.
under
the
contract
specification
defense
that
applies
in
most
states,
a
contractor
will
have
a
defense
if
he
simply
does
what
the
government
tells
him.
and
the
question
here
is
whether
the
government
can
enter
into
a
cooperative
give-and-take
relationship
to
get
this
kind
of
equipment
or
does
it
have
to
do
it
at
arms'
length,
simply
saying,
"we
want
this".
if
the
government
can't
have
that
kind
of
cooperative
relationship,
it
is
going
to
be
impossible
to
develop
the
technology
that
we
need
on
the
leading
edge
of
technology
around
the
world.
and
that
is
why
i
say
this
defense
is
really
inherent
in
the
power
to
provide
for
the
national
defense.
i
would
just
like
to
briefly
emphasize
that
we
are
concerned
that
the
defense
also
be
limited.
we
are
not
foreclosing
a
similar
defense
in
later
different
cases,
but
this
defense
in
this
case
need
only
and
should
only
be
limited
to,
(1)
military
equipment,
(2)
features
of
military
equipment
which
can
be
described
as
"special
order",
either
an
entire
system
that
is
special
ordered
or
specific
features
on
a
system
which
is
generally
available,
which
are
special
ordered.
we
are
not
in
favor
of
creating
a
defense
for
the
government
for
the
contractor
when
he
provides
a
can
of
beans
which
is
no
different
than
every
other
can
of
beans
that
it
provides,
nor
when
the
contractor
provides
a
jeep
which
is
just
like
every
other
jeep.
unless
the
government
says,
"we
want
this
one
to
be
different.
"
or,
unless
the
contractor
says,
"this
is
just
our
standard
jeep.
"
"now,
for
you,
in
your
application,
we
would
like
to
put
on
a
something
or
other.
"
"we
would
like
to
put
on
a
special
metal
undercoating.
"
or
something
like
that,
"to
make
it
safe".
and
the
government
comes
back
and
says,
"no,
we
want
it
just
the
way
it
is.
"
in
our
view,
that
would
be
a
special
order
application.
but
we
are
not
talking
about
protecting
contractors
when
they
are
selling
the
government
the
same
thing
they
sell
to
everybody
else,
even
if
they
run
blueprints
past
the
government
and
the
government
signs
off
and
says,
"this
is
what
we
want".
what
we
are
trying
to
protect
is
the
process,
the
interaction
and
the
developmental
process
of
products.
and
we
feel
that
the
government
has
got
to
be
able
to
have
that
flexibility
to
deal
on
a
close
coupled
basis
with
contractors
or
you
are
really
denying
the
government
the
ability
to
procure
these
fundamentally
essential
weapons
systems
that
it
has
got
to
have.
the
other
ways
in
which
the
defense
is
limited
in
our
view
and
is
limited
under
the
mckay
test,
(1)
there
is
no
protection
when
the
manufacturer
produces
a
product
negligently
or
fails
to
live
up
to
the
specifications.
so,
we
are
not
in
favor
of
simply
a
blanket
immunity
such
as
was
embodied
in
one
of
the
pieces
of
legislation
that
was
put
up
for
a
vote
in
congress
last
year.
and,
finally,
there
is,
of
course,
the
burden
of
warning
the
government
of
known
hazards.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
we
do
not
believe
that
there
should
be
a
burden
to
warn
of
hazards
they
should
have
known
because
that
does
exactly
what
we
seek
to
avoid
and
that
is
put
the
decision
on
the
procurement
process
in
the
hands
of
the
courts.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
certainly
not,
if...
certainly
not,
looking
to
civilian
industry
standards.
but
we
would
submit
even
looking
to
somewhat
amorphous
standard
of
the
military
industry
because
we
think
the
government
has
got
to
be
able
to
say,
for
example,
in
a
crisis
situation,
"we
want
this
product.
"
"we
want
these
specifications,
and
we
want
it
now.
"
"we
don't
want
it
in
three
months
after
you
have
had
time
to
run
all
the
tests
that
you
would
run
if
you
were
trying
to
produce
this
under
some
standard
that
a
court
would
dictate.
"
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
