mr.
franecke,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
franecke?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
your
reasons
for
granting
the
writ
in
your
petition
for
sui
juris,
it
strikes
me
your
entire
argument
there
is
devoted
to
what
is
the
government
contractor
defense.
did
the
fourth
circuit
get
it
right?
and
almost
nothing,
in
fact,
i
can
see
nothing
at
all
to
the
fact
that
the
government
had
approved
a
jury
instruction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
reply
brief
to
the
government's
response
to
the
petition.
chief
justice
rehnquist
enacted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
franecke,
what
was
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
case?
was
it
diversity
of
citizenship?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
the
fourth
circuit
is
simply
applying
virginia
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and,
so,
we
are
just
basically
reviewing
a
question
here
of
virginia
tort
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
source
of
law?
is
it
virginia
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
mean
answer
my
question.
i
asked
you:
is
it
virginia
law?
do
you
answer
that
question,
yes?
or
do
you
answer
it,
no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
source
of
the
federal
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
source
that
they
say
the
federal
has
in
those
opinions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
i
don't
mean
the
substance
of
the
defense,
but
we
are
dealing
with
a
case
that
ordinarily
would
be
decided
strictly
under
virginia
law.
and
you
say,
no,
there
is
a
federal
element
in
it
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
fourth
circuit
had
to
apply
a
particular
rule
as
to
government
contractors,
even
though
perhaps
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
wouldn't.
and
why
is
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
know,
but
i
realize
the
trial
judge,
but
i
would
like
to
hear
more
from
you
about
why
this
is...
why
there
is
an
element
of
a
federal
question
here
rather
than
something
that
virginia
is
free
to
decide
for
itself.
what
is
the
closest
case
from
this
court
on
the
point?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
asked
you:
what
is
the
closest
case
from
this
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
stencel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may,
mr.
franecke.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
lacovara.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
you
are
asking
us
to
do,
mr.
lacovara
is
to
formulate
a
federal
common
law
rule
that
protects
government
contractors
in
this
situation
where
ordinarily
state
law
would
govern.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
going
to
go
on
with
those?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
was
a
federal
tort
claims
act
case,
stencel.
was
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
under
the
law
of
a
particular
state.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
that
is
an
argument
against
the
way
the
federal
tort
claims
acts
is
structured,
too.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it
possible
that
this
court
might
decide
to,
quite
logically,
adopt
such
a
defense
in
dohsa
cases,
death
on
the
high
seas
act
cases,
but
not
adopt
it
in
a
case
where
it
simply
turns
on
state
tort
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
in
a
way,
congress
has
already
said.
it
has
said
where
the
dohsa
law,
act
applies.
that
wouldn't
be
some
novel
thing
that
the
court
goes
out
and
says,
"well,
two
and
a
half
miles
is
a
good
idea.
"
congress
has
said
that
in
the
dohsa.
chief
justice
rehnquist
or
do
away
with
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lacovara.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
ayer.
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
you
could
have...
you
could
say
that
and
still,
supposing
this
helicopter,
you
know,
had
simply
fallen
apart
and
injured
a
civilian
on
the
ground,
it
would
not
necessarily
be
the
same
rule
of
law
that
would
apply.
would
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
there
were
a
committee
of
congress
now
to
get
together
and
say,
"we
want
to
look
into
the
possibility
of
a
government
contractor
defense.
"
what
do
you
think
their
sense
would
be,
looking
at
what's
been
decided.
do
you
think
they
would
say
the
federal
courts
have
already
established
such
a
defense?
or
do
you
think
they
would
say,
"well,
the
supreme
court
has
never
spoken.
"
"it
is
just
a
brand
new
issue?
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
prior
to
our
deciding
this
case,
but
looking
at
the
cases
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
decided.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
do
you
think
they
would
say
the
courts,
the
federal
courts
have
established
a
government
contractor
defense?
or
do
you
think
they
would
say,
"no,
the
supreme
court
hasn't
spoken,
so
the
courts
have
just
done
nothing
in
that
area.
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ayer.
mr.
franecke,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
franecke.

justice

h.
rehnquist
