mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
turning
to
the
contours
of
the
military
contractor
defense
as
virtually
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
but
one
have
defined
that
defense,
i
would
like
to
undertake
to
show
why
this
case
does
squarely
present
that
issue
and
no
other
issue.
counsel--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--we
have
used
the
term
military
contractor
defense
in
our
brief,
justice
scalia,
somewhat
designedly.
the
only
argument
that
we
are
making
before
this
court
is
that
the
defense...
this
defense,
there
may
be
others
including
the
contract
specification
defense
to
which
justice
o'connor
referred,
that
would
apply
to
providers
of
civilian
products.
the
argument
in
favor
of
the
defense
that
we
have
invoked
in
this
case
is
that
it
applies
because
of
the
nature
of
military
procurement
and
the
constitutional
system
under
which
that
process
takes
place,
as
well
as
other
doctrines
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
are
unique
to
the
military
relationship.
so,
we
have
chosen
to
use
the
term--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--no.
quite
the
contrary.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
as
a
corollary
of
the
separation
of
powers,
the
courts
should
not
intervene
in
reexamining
design
decisions
when
those
decisions
are
at
bottom
decisions
made
by
the
political
branches
of
the
government.
that
is
what
tort
litigation
challenging
the
design
of
a
military
product
involves
if
the
contractor
meets
the
standards
that
we
say
were
met
here.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
correct.
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
this
case,
relied
on
its
separate
opinion
in
a
companion
case,
the
tozer
case,
decided
the
same
day
by
the
same
panel.
in
that
case,
the
panel
expressly
stated
in
the
concluding
footnote
that
this
is
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
even
where
the
case
arises
under
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
almost
all
of
the
court...
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
addressed
the
question
have
reached
that
conclusion.
the
reasons
for
treating
this
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
are
similar
to
those
to
which
justice
scalia
referred.
this
court
has
held
in
two,
i
would
submit,
closely
analogous
areas
that
federal
common
law
does
govern.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
will
mention
them
at
this
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
standard
oil
case
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
relationship
among
the
united
states,
its
soldiers
and
third
parties
who
allegedly
injure
soldiers
is
to
be
governed
by
federal
common
law
and
then,
more
recently,
in
the
stencel
aero
case
where
the
issue
was
specifically
relationship
between
a
military
contractor
and
the
united
states
concerning
liability
for
an
accident
involving
a
military
product,
the
court
again
held,
in
so
many
words,
that
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
its
contractors
is
to
be
governed--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--yes,
but
what
the
court
was
deciding
was
that
the
underlying
law
that
would
be
applied...
indeed,
in
stencel,
the
court
said,
"as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
we
will
not
recognize
a
claim,
a
tort
claim
or
an
indemnity
claim.
"
the
tort
claims
act,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
you
know,
simply
waives
the
government'
sovereign
immunity
and
leaves
it
subject
to
suit
if
there
is
some
underlying
basis
for
a
claim.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
is
correct.
and
in
this
court,
in
stencel
aero,
the
court
said,
"congress
has
waived
the
tort
claims
act
immunity
from
suit.
"
we
then
have
to
look
to
see
whether
there
is
a
claim
for
relief
that
the
contractor
may
assert
against
the
government.
and
the
court
held
that
question
is
to
be
determined
by
federal
common
law.
and
the
court
decided
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
not
to
permit
the
claim.
but
i
think
all
of
the
reasons--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--against
the
united
states.
but
the
underpinning
of
the
decision
as
in
the
standard
oil
case
was
that
where
you
are
talking
about
a
matter
of
this
sort,
the
relationship
which
is
really
tripartite,
the
united
states,
its
service
personnel,
and
the
contractors
who
are
hired
by
the
united
states
to
provide
material
for
the
war
and
defense
efforts,
the
incidence
of
that
relationship
have
to
be
treated
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law.
and
i
think
that
is
not
disputed
by
petitioner.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress
could
address
the
issue,
justice
stevens.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
would
say
that
the
courts
have
quite
adequate
competence
in
the
matter
and
should
undertake
this
responsibility.
we
are,
after
all,
talking
about
doctrines
of
liability
to
which
this
is
a
defense.
and
those
are
court-created
liabilities.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
they
may
or
may
not
be.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
half
of
these
cases,
justice
stevens
arise
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
or
some
equivalent
matter
where
there
is
direct
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
one
of
the
things
that
i'm
pointing
out
is
that
it
makes
no
sense
in
administering
a
system
in
this
part
of
the
century
to
have
disparate
rights.
and
that
is
one
reason
for
having
federal
law
rather
than
50
or
51
jurisdiction
laws--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--congress
has
decided,
because
most
of
the
torts
that
congress
had
in
mind
were
automobile
accident
cases
and
things
of
that
sort
where
the
primary
interest
that
a
jurisdiction
might
have
in
deciding
what
the
rules
of
law
would
be
would
be
that
of
the
locale
where
the
accident
occurred.
it
is
a
very
different
situation,
as
the
court
said
in
standard
oil
and
stencel
aero,
where
you
are
talking
about
military
relationships.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
that
is
conceivable
outcome.
the
court
has
to
decide
what
legal
regime,
what
jurisdictions
law
will
apply.
we
have
spent
five
or
six
pages
in
our
brief
explaining
why
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
addressed
the
issue
have
sensibly
concluded
that
this
needs
to
be
resolved
as
a
matter
of
uniform
federal
common
law.
it
is
purely
fortuitous
where
one
of
these
helicopters
or
a
jet
aircraft
of
the
type
involved
in
several
of
the
other
cases
may
be
operating,
this
accident
happened
to
occur
just
short
of
the
three-mile
limit
in
the
atlantic
ocean.
it
is
purely
fortuitous
where
it
occurred.
it
would
make
no
sense,
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
say
that
if
the
accident
had
occurred
in
another
mile
seaward,
federal
law
would
apply,
but
the
contractor
here
has
liability--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--yes.
i
agree
that
there
are
lines
that
have
to
be
drawn
and
that
there
are
conceivable
places
that
someone
might
draw
the
line
other
than
applying
federal
common
law.
my
submission
is
that
the
best
policy
arguments
for
choosing
a
rule
of
law,
and
a
rule
of
law
has
to
be
chosen,
support
fashioning
a
federal
uniform
common
law.
now,
the
question
that
was
asked
by
justice
stevens
was:
shouldn't
this
be
left
to
congress?
and
i
think
the
answer
is,
although
congress
plainly
has
power
under
article
1
to
fashion
or
redefine
the
defense,
as
justice
o'connor
indicated.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
or
do
away
with
it.
the
point
is
that
we
are
talking
about
a
determination
in
court
what
is
the
appropriate
limit
of
liability
if
any
for
a
contractor
who
complies
with
a
government
approved
design
and
provides
a
product
that
the
department
of
the
navy
decided
was
appropriate
for
military
use.
that
is
a
question
of
judicially
fashioned
law.
all
of
the
doctrines
to
which
mr.
franecke
referred
are
court-created
doctrines.
the
courts
have
felt
quite
comfortable
fashioning
appropriate
defenses
to
deal
with
those
doctrines
of
negligence
or
breach
of
implied
warranty
or
strict
liability.
i
submit
that
as
this
court
has
said
on
other
occasions,
despite
erie
v.
thompkins--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--yes,
sir.
well,
let
me
say
that
i
think
the
outcome
would
be
the
same
if
state
law
governed.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
are
urging
that
this
court
agree
with
the
lower
courts
that
this
is
an
appropriate
area
for
development
and
recognition
of
federal
interests
which
justify
applying
federal
law
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
absolutely.
because
of
the
interests
that
we
think
are
at
stake,
it
should
not
be
permissible
for
a
state
to
say,
"we
will
impost
liability
on
a
contractor
for
executing
the
will
of
the
department
of
the
navy
in
providing
equipment
that
the
navy
wants
provided
in
order
to
provide
for
the
national
defense.
"
that
is
a
matter
of
primary
interest
to
the
national
government
under
the
allocation
of
powers
between
federal
and
state
governments.
and
i
think
standard
oil
is
exactly
that
kind
of
case,
as
is
stencel
aero.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
that
situation,
where
you--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--where
you
were
talking
about
a
situation
where
there
were
going
to
be
no
operational
impacts
on
the
conduct
of
the
armed
forces,
the
question
was:
what
are
the
financial
consequences
for
the
government
when
a
soldier
is
injured
in
an
automobile
accident?
we
are
talking
here
and
i
think
the
solicitor
general
will
be
addressing
these
issues
in
a
moment
about
something
that
is
much
more
fundamental,
more
important
and
more
immediate
in
determining
what
the
effect
will
be
on
the
system
of
federal
military
procurements.
this
is
a
matter
that
the
courts
have
not
only
fashioned
out
of
whole
cloth.
that
is
not
the
way,
an
accurate
way
of
describing
this,
as
petitioner
would
suggest.
this
is
an
area
where
the
courts
have
taken
long
established
common
law
doctrines,
including
several
doctrines
that
this
court,
itself,
has
fashioned:
the
yearsley
case
involving
one
aspect
of
the
government
specifications
defense.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
that
understates
the
significance
of
the
case,
justice
stevens.
other
courts
have
interpreted
it
more
broadly
as
the
rationale
in
the
court's
opinion
would
suggest:
the
focus
was
not
so
much
on
the
availability
of
a
possible
fifth
amendment
remedy
against
the
united
states,
but
on
the
unfairness
of
imposing
liability
on
the
contractor.
but
to
take
the
case
back
another
30
years
to
the
spearin
case
which
is
also
cited
in
our
brief,
there
was
no
condemnation
element
there
and
the
court
said,
in
so
many
terms,
"when
a
contractor
complies
with
the
specifications
provided
by
the
united
states,
the
contractor
is
not
responsible
for
the
consequences
of
compliance
with
those
specifications.
"
that
is
a
generally
recognized
common
law
doctrine
recognized
not
only
by
this
court,
but
recognized
in
the
restatement
of
torts
and
what
the
federal
and
state
courts
have
done,
and
justice
o'connor
is
absolutely
correct
in
saying
no
court,
federal
or
state,
has
rejected
this
defense.
what
they
have
said
is,
as
liability
law
has
been
allowed
to
evolve,
it
is
appropriate
for
the
courts
to
fashion
appropriate
limits
or
defenses
for
evolving
liability
claims
and
to
apply
the
analogous
doctrines
to
recognize
the
defense
in
cases
of
this
sort
where,
as
the
proof
shows,
the
department
of
the
navy
specifically
approved
those
very
design
features
that
plaintiff
claims
are
the
basis
for
a
monetary
award.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no.
the
issue,
when
it
was
submitted
to
the
court
in
request
for
instructions
was
framed
by
both
parties
with
citations
to
the
mckay
case,
the
tillett
case
and
other...
koutsoubos
in
the
district
court,
other
federal
cases
that
had
eventuated
by
that
time.
now,
there
were
other
state
law
defenses
that
were
made,
but,
as
i
was
about
to
suggest
to
the
chief
justice,
the
outcome
might
be
the
same,
probably
would
be
the
same
under
state
law
because
the
states,
when
they
have
been
confronted
with
cases
of
this
sort,
have
also
recognized
a
military
contractor
defense,
but
our
submission
is
that,
although
that
underscores
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
court
wouldn't
be
displacing
state
policy
by
adopting
federal
common
law,
it
is
a
factor
that
the
court
should
recognize
in
feeling
that
federal
common
law
is
the
appropriate
way
to
assure
uniformity
for
products
that
will
be
used
fortuitously
throughout--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--i
think
that
there
is
only
one
exception
to
what
i
would
say
is
the
uniform
approach
of
the
federal
courts.
that
is
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
in
shaw.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say,
justice
o'connor,
that
when
you
read
all
of
the--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--that
is
the
single
question
that
has
divided
the
eleventh
circuit
from
the
other
courts.
all
of
the
other
courts
of
appeals
that
have
addressed
this
have
now
said
that
the
defense
applies
where
the
contractor
either
gets
specifications
promulgated
by
the
government,
which
is
rare,
or
participates
in
the
design.
the
one
point
of
division
is
what
is
the
nature
of
the
contractor's
duty
to
warn.
the
eleventh
circuit
said,
"the
contractor
has
a
burden
of
reasonable
inquiry.
"
which
we
and
the
government
say
would
actually
disrupt
the
process
and
lead
to
less
safety
than
more.
all
the
other
courts
of
appeals
have
said
the
issue
is
simply:
does
the
contractor
actually
know
of
something,
a
hazard
in
the
design
about
which
the
government
is
ignorant.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
can
be
an
overhead
cost
under
certain
kinds
of
relationships.
if
it
is
a
fixed
price
contract,
however,
and
i
believe
the
record
here
indicates
that
the
contract
for
these
helicopters
which
were
procured
for
military
service
in
vietnam
during
the
war,
was
a
fixed
price
contract.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it
depends
on
the
negotiation
process.
i
think
another
point
on
that,
really
a
side
light,
i
think,
in
terms
of
the
mission
before
the
court,
is
that
when
these
contracts
were
let
and
when
these
helicopters
were
being
designed,
it
was
in
the
1960's
when
a
liability
suit
of
this
sort
would
have
been
virtually
unthinkable.
we
are
in
this
position
25
years
after
this
contract
process
began
because
liability
law
has
evolved
far
beyond
insurance
coverage
at
the
time,
but
i
think
that
is
not
the
real
issue
on
which
we
reset.
i
was
going
to
emphasize
that
the
only
issue
before
the
court
is
that
one.
in
petitioner's
brief
before
the
court
of
appeals,
he
said
on
two
occasions,
and
the
court
of
appeals
took
him
at
his
word
and
expressly
reported
this
in
its
opinion,
that
the
only
issues
that
were
being
advanced
were
the
claims
that
there
was
a
negligent
repair
of
this
servo-system
and
a
negligent
design
of
the
escape
system.
petitioner
said
that
twice
in
his
brief
below
and
that
is
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
the
case.
i
think
it
is
too
late
now
to
say
that
there
is
another
negligent
design
issue
that
this
court
ought
to
address.
the
logan
case,
the
virginia
law
burden
of
proof
case
on
page
395
of
the
transcript
was
specifically
argued
as
a
basis
for
directing
a
verdict
on
the
ground
that
plaintiff
had
not
borne
his
burden
under
virginia
law.
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
on
appeal
was
the
case
here.
so,
as
the
case
comes
before
this
court,
the
only
issue
is
the
one
that
was
framed
in
the
petition:
what
are
the
appropriate
standards
for
the
military
contractor
defense.
we
have
explained
in
our
brief
why
the
defense
should
exist,
why
it
should
be
recognized
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
and
why
it
is
a
corollary
of
important
constitutional
and
legal
doctrines.
at
bottom,
it
is
a
separation
of
powers
question.
in
this
kind
of
suit
or
any
kind
of
suit,
where
the
plaintiff
is
claiming
that
he
is
entitled
to
damages
because
military
equipment
has
been
improperly
designed
and
where
the
contractor
shows
that
that
very
feature
was
approved
by
the
military,
what
the
plaintiff
is
asking
the
court
and
civilian
jury
to
do
is
to
say
that
the
military
decision
to
provide
him
or
her
with
that
piece
of
material
was
wrongful
and
should
bear
consequences.
now,
the
united
states
is
immunized
under
either
feres
or
more
generally
under
the
discretionary
function
exception
and
the
question,
therefore,
is:
should
there
be
a
backdoor
attack
on
the
nature
of
the
military
decision
by
exposing
the
contractor
to
liability
in
tort
for
the
consequences
of
the
design
decision,
that
the
contractor
proves
were
specifically
approved
by
the
military
department.

lacovara
if
it
is
a
negligent
manufacture
or
an
aspect--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--if
it
is
a
design
effect
concerning
a
feature
of
the
helicopter
that
was
not
before
the
military
department--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--if
it
was
approved
the
military?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
okay.
what
you
have
there,
justice
scalia,
is
a
different
question,
obviously.
several
of
the
bases
for
the
military
contractor
defense
would
involve
or
could
involve
immunity
under
that
circumstance,
just
as
the
united
states
would
be
immune
if
the
decision
that
the
court
would
have
to
make
would
be
to
inquire
into
the
soundness,
the
reasons
of
the
military
judgment
to
design
a
helicopter
with
those
rotors,
you
might
very
well
have
the
same
reasons
for
a
defense
even
where
the
civilian
is
injured.
one
factor
that
would
not
be
present
that
is
present
in
this
type
of
case,
and
it
is
the
typical
case
involving
military
accidents
is
that
congress
has
another
system
of
compensation
that
it
has
set
up
equivalent
to
workmen's
comp
system.
so,
the
balance
might
be
different,
but
some
of
the
bases
for
immunity
would
apply.
i
have
ceded
the
balance
of
my
time
to
the
solicitor
general.
and,
if
there
are
no
questions
from
the
court,
i
would
rest
at
that
point.
