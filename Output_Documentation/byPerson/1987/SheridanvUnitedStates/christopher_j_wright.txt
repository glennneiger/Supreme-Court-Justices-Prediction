mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
where
we
recently
ended.
it
does
indeed
refer
to
any
claim
arising
out
of
battery,
and
i
think
as
justice
marshall
just
pointed
out,
without
the
battery
in
this
case
there
would
be
no
claim.
certainly
mr.
carr's
action
in
taking
a
rifle
and
shooting
it
at
the
petitioner's
car
is
where
this
claim
originated.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right,
and
it's
also
true
that
without
the
assault,
without
the
battery
there
wouldn't
be
a
claim,
either,
and
this
court
has
said
and
held
in
block
v.
neal
that
where
a
claim
is
an...
where
an
action
is
an
essential
element
of
the
claim,
the
claim
is
part--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--block
held
that
in
distinguishing
neustadt.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
under
panella,
the
government
is
liable,
or
section...
the
intentional
tort
exception
doesn't
bar
that
claim.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
because
the
court--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--the
second
circuit
in
1954
essentially
read
the
phrase
"committed
by
a
government
employee"
into
the
statute.
it
is
right
there
on
page
624
of
the
opinion.
the
government
has
not
quarreled
with
that
gloss
on
the
statute
in
the
last
34
years.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
that's
right,
and
i
will
say
that
if...
mr.
kator
points
to
a
number
of
difficult
lines
that
are
to
be
drawn,
all
of
which
i
would
submit
are
caused
by
that
gloss
on
the
statute.
we
don't
think
that
those
line
drawing
problems
are
particularly
difficult.
they
occur
in
a
fairly
small
number
of
cases.
the
vast
bulk
of
cases
where
the
government
is
to
be
held
liable
are
intentional
torts
committed
by
employees.
if
the
choice
is
between
the
gloss
on
the
statute
and
the
words
of
the
statute,
we
think
it's
the
gloss
that
has
to
go,
but
we
think
that
the
statute
can...
that
the
gloss
added
the
phrase
34
years.
i'd
also,
while
discussing
the
extremely
sweeping
language
of
this
statute
like
to
point
to
the
court's
opinion
in
kosak,
too,
where
the
court...
where
the
whole
issue,
the
dispute
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent
was
whether
"arising
in
respect
of"
is
as
broad
as
"arising
out
of",
which
everybody
agreed
was
simply
extremely
broad
language.
petitioners
have
made
three
arguments
designed
to
evade
the
sweeping
language
of
the
statute,
and
i'd
like
to
address
each
in
turn.
their
broadest
argument
is
their
argument
that
congress
meant
to
bar
claims
involving
batteries
only
when
the
plaintiff
asserts
that
the
government
is
liable
under
respondeat
superior.
there
is
no
basis
for
the
distinction
petitioners
urge
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
reasonably
found.
the
language
of
the
statute
arising
out
of,
any
claim
arising
out
of
assault
and
battery
doesn't
hint
at
a
distinction
between
respondeat
superior
and
negligent
supervision,
as
four
members
of
this
court
noted
in
shearer,
and
as
petitioners
demonstrated
in
their
brief,
and
noted
a
few
minutes
ago,
both
theories,
respondeat
superior
and
negligent
supervision,
were
known
to
courts
at
the
time
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
passed
in
1946.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
but
of
course
negligent
supervision
claims
arise
most
frequently
for
a
tort
committed
by
an
employee.
section
317
of
the
restatement
of
torts
sets
out
the
broadest
case
where
someone
can
be
responsible
for
the
tort...
for
the
intentional
tort
of
another,
and
that
frequently
occurs
when
an
employee
is
diligently
supervised.
we
have
reprinted
section
317
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
but
the
language
covers
both.
if
congress
had
intended
to
limit
it
in
some
way,
it
could
have
done
so,
as
the
plurality
noted
in
shearer,
by
saying
any
claim
for
assault
and
battery,
because
a
respondeat
superior
claim
is
a
claim
for
the
battery
rather
than
arising
out
of
the
battery.
if
that's
what
congress
had
meant,
especially
since
it
was
well
known
that
there
were
these
two
theories
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed,
we
think
congress
would
have
done
something
to
make
that
clear,
and
it
certainly
didn't.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
that's
the
hardest
case,
and
that
is
where
the
line
has
to
be
drawn.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
first,
if
you
take
the
gloss
added
in
panella
seriously,
as
if
it
were
really
part
of
the
statute,
then
in
the
one
case
where
with
the
government
employee
the
intentional
tort
exception
would
bar
the
suit,
in
the
other
case,
where
there's
a
non-employee,
the
intentional
tort
exception
would
not
bar
the
suit.
that,
we
think,
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
reading
of
what
congress
might
have
meant.
after
all,
the
court
in
panella
didn't
just
grab
committed
by
a
federal
employee
out
of
thin
air,
as
i
might
say
some
of
the
other
exceptions
that
have
been
proposed
do
come
out
of
thin
air.
it
looked
at
what
congress
was
doing
in
1946,
and
it
is
true
that
congress
was
focusing
on
torts
committed
by
federal
employees.
that
was
what
was
uppermost
in
their
mind.
the
postal
truck
hitting
a
pedestrian
was
the
prime
case
congress
was
after.
i
might
note
that
if
a
postal
driver
purposely
runs
over
somebody,
the
intentional
tort
exception
bars
that
claim,
which
certainly
would
seem
anomalous
from
the
standpoint
of
the
person
who
got
hit,
who
suffers
the
same
injury
whether
or
not
the
driver
negligently
hit
him
or
intentionally
ran
him
over,
and
in
cases
like
that
the
pedestrian
has
to
argue
that
the...
in
order
to
collect,
that
the
postal
driver
intentionally
hit
him...
did
not
intentionally
hit
him,
wasn't
out
to
get
him.
so
there
is
that
anomaly
that
flows
from
the
language
of
the
statute.
we
think
it's
reasonable,
congress
could
well
have
decided,
as
the
panella
gloss
has
it,
that
congress
wanted
to
preserve
sovereign
immunity
in
those
vast
bulk
of
cases
where
an
intentional
tort
was
committed
by
a
federal
employee.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
that
would
be
right.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
right.
well,
i
think
that
the
1974
amendment
to
the
act
makes
quite
clear
that
congress
understood
the
act
to
bar
negligent
supervision
claims.
after
all,
what
the
1974
amendment
did
was,
it's
an
exception
to
the
exception,
so
that
when
batteries
are
committed
by
law
enforcement
officers
under
certain
circumstances
the
government
becomes
liable,
and
the
background
of
that
amendment
was
that
there
were
several
incidents
of
no-knock
raids
repeated
over
time.
as
the
court
noted
in
shearer,
these
obviously
flowed
from
negligent
supervision
of
the
policemen
doing
that,
and
the
amendment--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--excuse
me?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
or
committed
a
battery
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
is
actually
much
more
difficult
to
prove
that
a
battery
was--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
that's
right,
but
the
exception
waives
that
as
well,
and
indeed
it's
the
negligent
supervision
cases
that
are
far
the
greater
number
of
cases.
it
was
very
unusual
in
1946--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
one
would
have
thought
that
congress
would
have
said
something
about
that,
especially
when
the
background
seems
to
me
to
plainly
be
one
of
remedying
negligent
supervision
cases
rather
than
respondeat
superior
cases.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
he
wasn't.
i
have
to
remind
myself
of
the
exact
words
of
the
proviso.
it
appears
that
if
he
had
been
a
law
enforcement
officer,
then
the
government
would
be
liable,
or
stated
another
way,
the
intentional--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
liable
for
the
injury
caused
to
the...
caused
to
the
petitioners,
which,
yes,
there
would
still
have
to
be
shown
to
be
some
negligence
somewhere.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
but
the
intentional
tort
exception
doesn't
apply
in
that
case.
we
admit--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
under
the
basic
provision
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
you
have
to
show
a
negligent
or
wrongful
act
by
some
government
actor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i'm
sorry.
okay.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
stand
corrected.
if
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer
got
drunk
and
started
shooting
people,
i
think
that
that's
wrongful
and
we
wouldn't
need
to
show
any
additional
negligence.
of
course,
even
if...
if
it
were
close
to
the
line
as
to
whether
or
not
the
battery
was
negligent
or
reasonable,
nevertheless
if
it
was
a
sort
of
repeated
situation
where
this
particular
officer
kept
making
these
kinds
of
mistakes,
you
could
establish
liability
to
show
that
he
was
negligently
supervised,
and
that
these
sorts
of
incidents
were
occurring
with
great
regularity,
and
establish
liability
on
that
basis.
the
proviso
just
reads
the
exception
out
of
the
act
in
certain
cases.
i'd
like
to
note
that
petitioners
say
that
one
of
the
advantages
of
their
rule
is
that
there
are
no
line-drawing
problems.
that
is
because,
i
would
submit,
there
would
be
very
few
cases
in
which
the
government
would...
where
the
intentional
tort
exception
would
bar
liability,
and
as
was
pointed
out,
the
whole
point
of
the
intentional
tort
exception
is
to
bar
government
liability
in
cases
where
a
private
party
would
be
liable
under
the
same
circumstances.
we
don't
think
a--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--you
would
have
to
show
it
was
within
the
scope
of
employment,
and
the
dissenting
judge
below--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
those
cases,
the
courts
are
divided
on
those
cases
as
to
whether
that
is
within
the
scope
of
employment.
it
is
by
no
means--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--it
does
do
that,
but
of
course
the
government
might
not--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
when
a
government
employee
commits
a
battery,
it
is
always
alleged
that
the
employer
should
have
known
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
and
the
fact
that
the
employee
was
hired,
and
did
this
terrible
thing
usually
goes
a
long
way
to
proving
that
he
was
negligently
supervised.
i'd
like
to
point
out
in
this
connection,
i
think
it's
useful
to
take
a
look
at
exactly
what
the
law
is
on
when
people
can
be
responsible
for
batteries
committed
by
third
parties.
the
restatement
sections,
315
to
320,
set
that
out
in
some
detail,
and
it's
worth
noting
that
section
315
is
quite
clear
that
there's
no
general
duty
to
prevent
someone
from
committing
a
battery.
it's
only
where
a
special
circumstance
exists,
and
section
317,
as
i
mentioned,
is
one
of
those
that
sets
out
the
employer...
employee
relationship,
and
employers
are
liable
for
intentional
torts
committed
by
their
employees
outside
the
scope
of
their
employment
under
that
section
in
a
number
of
circumstances.
and
i'd
like
to
note
that
under
panella,
under
the
panella
gloss
we
think
it
quite
clear
at
least
that
the
government
can
never
be
liable
under
section
317.
we
think
that
it's
enough
that
if
the
tort
was
committed
by
a
federal
employee,
it's
plainly...
the
action
is
plainly
barred.
but
in
any
event,
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
the
plaintiff
cannot
bring
a
suit
based
on
the
fact
of
the
employee...
employer
relationship
or
anything
like
that,
and
i
think
that
petitioners
agree
with
that.
they,
however,
just
sort
of
broadly
state
that
of
course
the
owner
of
the
hospital
in
this
case
would
be
liable
even
if
carr
were
just
a
drunk
who
wandered
in
off
the
street.
we
don't
think
that
that's
clear
at
all,
and
petitioners
have
never
specified
where
they
think
that
result
comes
from.
nor
did
the
dissenting
judge
below,
who
seemed
to
assume
it
as
well,
although
the
majority
plainly
agreed
with
us.
there
are
only
a
handful
of
exceptions,
and
none
of
them
apply
here.
there
is
no
parent-child
rule,
or
anything
else
of
that
nature.
finally,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
doe
v.
united
states
argument,
the
argument
that...
is
that
when
there
is
a
special
relationship
to
protect...
a
special
duty
to
protect
the
victim,
that
those
cases
are
different
than
others.
the
seventh
circuit
in
january
did
indeed
essentially
agree
with
that
reading,
and
read,
as
the
dissent
in
that
case
pointed
out,
the
phrase
"except
where
the
government
has
a
special
duty
to
protect
the
victim.
"
into
the
statute,
that's
based
on
section
320
of
the
restatement
of
tort,
which
says
that
in
such
circumstances
people
can
be
liable
for
batteries
committed
by
others.
we
think,
first,
that
that
case
was
wrongly
decided,
that
unlike
the
gloss
added
by
the
court
in
panella,
the
court...
the
seventh
circuit
in
doe
v.
united
states
simply
did
not
identify
any
basis
in
the
history
or
structure
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
the...
for
what
it
was
reading
into
the
act,
and
petitioners
haven't
identified
any
other
reason
for
reading
such
an
exception
into
the
act.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
that's
right,
and
that's
our
second
argument
here,
that
in
any
event
the
special
duty
argument
doesn't
arise
here
because
contrary
to
petitioner's...
the
enactment
of
a
regulation,
the
regulation
in
this
case
anyway
doesn't
come
close
to
establishing
a
duty
to
protect
petitioners.
under
restatement
section
320
you
have
a
special
duty
to
protect
your
wards,
people
you
are
custodians
of,
like
children
in
a
day
care
center.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
that's
true.
and
our
first
argument
is
that
2680(h)
bars
the
claim
on
that
basis.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
court
actually
even
needs
to
reach
the
issue
of
the
day
care
center
type
case,
because
the
facts
here
are
so
short
of
showing
any
special
duty
to
protect
the
victim
that...
the
court
of
appeals
essentially
dismissed
this
argument
in
one
paragraph,
and
we
think
correctly,
because
there's
just
no
basis
here.
the
navy
was
never
the
custodians
of
petitioners.
petitioners
were
driving
down
a
public
street
in
their
car.
the
regulation
prohibits
the
keeping
of
firearms
in
the
barracks.
it
doesn't
prohibit
the
keeping
of
firearms
anywhere
else.
the
regulation
was
not
aimed
at
protecting
petitioners.
mr.
kator
mentioned
negligence
per
se
in
connection
with
the
regulation.
negligence
per
se
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
sort
of
claim.
negligence
per
se
is
used
to
conclusively
show
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
actor
in
certain
cases.
if
carr
had
kept
the
gun
in
his
barracks
and
it
had
discharged
and
injured
someone,
negligence
per
se
would
be
used
to
show
that
carr
was
negligent.
carr's
culpability
is
not
at
issue
here.
he
was
more
than
negligent,
and
the
fact
that
the
navy--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--he
kept
it
in
his
barracks.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
was
against
the
rules.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
for
him
it--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--certainly
it
could
be.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it's
not
negligence
per
se
that
that
aspect
doesn't
add
anything
to
the
case.
the
government
carr
was
definitely
negligent.
the
government
could
have
been
negligent
for
not
finding
out,
but
we
don't
think
negligence
per
se
analysis
adds
anything
to
this
case.
we
don't
think
it
would
make
any
sense,
moreover,
for
the
navy
to
become
liable
because--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--he
wasn't
allowed
to
have
the
gun
in
the
barracks,
and
he
did
so.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
true,
but
it
seems
that
the
regulation
hardly
matters
one
way
or
another
here.
if
the
navy
hadn't
had
the
regulation,
it
would
seem
backwards
to
make
the
navy
liable
because
it
enacted
this
sort
of
regulation
if
it
wouldn't
have
been
liable
in
the
absence
of
the
regulation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
if
carr
did
not
have
a
rifle,
and
did
not
get
drunk
and
start
shooting
at
metro
buses
and
cars
passing
by,
no
injury
would
have
resulted
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
is
a
gloss
on
the
gloss.
we
prefer
just
reading
the
gloss
in
its
plain
meaning,
if
you
will.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
however,
that
if
you
add
that
gloss
to
the
gloss,
certainly
then
any
negligent
supervision
claim
based
on
the
employment
relationship
goes
out
the
window,
and
that...
to
our
mind
that
includes
all
of
this
case.
it
certainly
includes
much
of
it.
it
certainly
includes
the
claim
made
in
the
complaint
that
hasn't
been
repeated
today
that
the
navy
should
have
known
that
carr
was
psychologically
unstable
and
taken
some
step
to
do
something
about
it,
since
that
was
based
on
the
employee-employer
relationship,
and
any
other...
and
most
of
the
other
claims,
it
seems
to
us,
could
only
have
a
chance
to
succeed
ultimately
if
they
were
based
on
section
317
of
the
restatement.
has
that
been
responsive,
justice
scalia?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
excuse
me?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
