when
he
was
born?
justice

he
didn't
have
the

by
assignment.
he
got
it
surreptitiously,
didn't
he?

wasn't

and
couldn't

couldn't
it
be
negligent
that
they
allowed
him
to
do
it?
justice

well,

say
it's
not
there.
justice

i
think
the
navy
is
liable
for
allowing
people
to
take
guns
when
they
are
not
authorized
to
take
them
if
they
are
loaded.
justice
marshall
and
if
it
hadn't
been
for
that,
these
people
wouldn't
have
been
injured.
justice
marshall
i
just
don't
want
anybody
giving
people
rifles.
that's
all.
unless
there's
a
reason
for
it.
