justice
stevens
what
do
you
do
with
the
escaped
mental
patient,
who
assaults
someone?
there
is
negligence
in
letting
him
escape,
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
if
he
escapes,
he
will
assault
someone.
liability
or
no
liability?
justice
stevens
why
not?
justice
stevens
doesn't
it
arise
out
of
the
assault
in
the
same
way?
justice
stevens
but
at
least
in
terms
of
your
literal
argument
it
is
equally
inconsistent
with
it,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
the
gloss
words
"committed
by
a
federal
employee"
does
kind
of
remind
us
of
respondeat
superior,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
let
me
just
go
back
for
a
second
to
my
mental
patient.
if
the
mental
patient
were
a
government
employee,
the
case
would
be
different
than
if
the
mental...
both
of
them,
assuming
they're
in
a
government
hospital,
and
one
case
involves
an
assault
by
an
escaped
mental
patient
who
is
an
employee
and
the
other
an
escaped
mental
patient
who
just
happens
to--
justice
stevens
--would
you
give
a
different
result
in
the
two
cases?
justice
stevens
but
on
your
intentional,
your
driver
intentionally
running
over
somebody,
supposing
he
does
it
20
times
and
his
boss
knows
it
and
keeps
him
on
the
job.
there
would
be
no
claim
against
the
boss
for
negligent
supervision
or
negligent
hiring,
on
the
ground
that
each...
the
totality
of
the
facts
all
arise
out
of
intentional
tort.
justice
stevens
you
think
it's
quite
clear
congress
would
not
have
wanted
liability
in
that
extreme
situation?
well,
i
can't
believe
that
that
particular
example
would
actually
happen.
well,
but
that's
basically
the
underlying
theory
of
all
these
cases,
that
there
was
notice
to
the
government
that
the
person
might
commit
an
assault
if
he
were
not
adequately
supervised,
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
justice
stevens
but
there's
a
proviso.
there's
liability
on
the
respondeat
superior
authority,
isn't
there?
justice
stevens
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
under
the
proviso
there's
a
liability
under
respondeat
superior.
you
don't
have
to
prove
negligent
supervision.
all
you
have
to
do
is
prove
the
law
enforcement
officer
committed
that
one
illegal
search.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
correct.
justice
stevens
but
there
doesn't
have
to
be
any
negligent
supervision,
is
what
i
am
trying
to
say.
justice
stevens
you
are
quite
wrong,
aren't
you?
there
wouldn't
have
to
be
negligence.
it
would
just
be
the
intentional
tort
of
the
law
enforcement
officer
who
shot
the
gun.
justice
stevens
well,
justice
kennedy
is
hypothesizing
a
law
enforcement
officer
who
did
exactly
what
the--
justice
stevens
--and
that
would
just...
all
he
has
to
do
is
prove
that's
who
he
was
and
he
shot
the
guy.
justice
stevens
that
isn't
right,
is
it?
there
must
be
a
lot
of
cases
in
which
a
government
employee
without
any
notice
to
any
of
its
supervisors
or
any
reason
for
the
government
to
expect
this
to
happen
goes
out
and
beats
somebody
up.
that
is
just
a
typical
assault
and
battery
one-incident
case.
there
would
be
no
government
liability.
justice
stevens
well,
he
is
driving
a
mail
truck
or
something
like
that,
gets
in
a
fight,
in
a
traffic
dispute
or
something
of
that
kind.
these
things
happen.
justice
stevens
well,
but
this
makes
it
perfectly
clear
there
will
be
no
liability
in
that
kind
of
case,
even
if
it
is
in
the
scope
of
employment.
justice
stevens
and
i
would
submit
there
must
be
quite
a
number
of
those
cases
where
there
really
isn't
any
colorable
basis
for
claiming
negligent
supervision
or
negligent
employment.
they
have
no
notice
of
this
thing
going
to
happen.
justice
stevens
yes,
i
know,
but
they
have
to
prove
it.
people
can
make
false
allegations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
second
case,
we
take
the
facts
--
we
assume
the
facts
are
--
are
as
i
will
state
them
in
the
way
which
in
the
case
comes
to
us.
after
finishing
his
shift
at
the
bethesda
naval
hospital,
a
service
man
named
carr
consumed
a
large
quantity
of
wine,
rum
and
other
alcoholic
beverages.
he
then
packs
some
of
his
belongings
including
a
riffle
and
ammunition
into
a
uniform
bag
and
left
his
quarters.
sometime
later,
three
naval
corpsmen
found
him
lying
faced
down
in
a
drunken
stupor
on
the
concrete
floor
of
a
hospital
building.
they
attempted
to
take
him
into
the
emergency
room
but
he
broke
away
grabbing
the
bag
and
revealing
the
barrel
of
rifle.
at
the
side
of
the
rifle
barrel
the
corpsman
fled,
or
in
the
words
of
one
other
corpsman,
they
just
got
out
of
dodge.
they
neither
took
further
action
to
subdue
carr
nor
alerted
the
appropriate
authorities
that
he
was
heavily
intoxicated
and
brandishing
a
weapon.
later
that
evening,
carr
fired
several
rifle
shots
into
an
automobile
being
driven
by
petitioners
on
a
public
street
near
the
bethesda
naval
hospital.
petitioners
brought
suit
against
the
united
states
alleging
that
their
injuries
were
caused
by
the
government's
negligence
in
allowing
carr
to
leave
the
hospital
with
a
loaded
rifle
in
his
possession.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
ground
that
the
claim
is
barred
by
a
provision
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
states
that
the
government
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
shall
not
apply
to
any
claim
arising
out
of
an
assault
or
battery.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
the
claim
in
this
case
one
arising
out
of
the
assault
or
battery
committed
by
carr
as
the
government
contends
or
is
one
arising
out
of
the
negligence
of
other
government
employees
as
petitioner's
contempt.
on
the
facts
of
the
case
before
us,
we
conclude
that
the
mere
fact
that
carr
happened
to
be
an
off-duty
federal
employee
at
the
time
of
the
incident
does
not
provide
a
basis
for
protecting
the
government
from
liability
that
would
otherwise
attach
if
he
had
been
an
unemployed
civilian
patient
or
visitor
at
the
hospital.
accordingly,
for
reason
stated
at
greater
length
than
the
opinion
we
have
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
he
exception
does
not
apply
and
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
justice
white
has
filed
a
concurring
statement.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
