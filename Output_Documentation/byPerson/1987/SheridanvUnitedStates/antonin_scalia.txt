justice
scalia
would
that
necessarily
follow?
i
mean,
in
the
day
care
center
cases
couldn't
you
say
that
the
distinction
turns
on
whether
the
obligation
to
the
plaintiff
arises
from
the
government's
status
as
an
employer,
or
rather
arises
from
the
government's
status
as
the
runner
of
the
center?
wouldn't
that
be
enough
to
throw
one
case
into
one
category
and
the
employment
cases
into
another?
justice
scalia
you
don't
disagree
with
that?
justice
scalia
--but
that
isn't...
that
isn't
the
object
of
the
act,
to
the
extent
it
has
that
exception.
i
mean,
a
private
individual
would
be
held
for
claims
arising
out
of
assault,
battery,
false
imprisonment,
false
arrest,
et
cetera,
all
the
exceptions
in
(h).
i
mean,
obviously
(h)
intended
to
do
something
different
from
what
would
happen
to
the
private
individual.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
so
you
think
the
only
effect
of
that
language
is
that
in
all
government
employment
situations
the
claim
for
assault
by
a
government
employee
will
now
not
be
based
on
respondeat
superior
but
a
claim
of
negligent
failure
to
supervise?
justice
scalia
you
can
bring
all
of
those
things
whenever
there's
a
government
employee,
so
long
as
you
allege
negligent
failure
to
supervise?
justice
scalia
surely
you
can
forgive
justice
stevens
for
thinking
that
that
maybe
was
all
that
it
waived.
i
mean,
you
say
it
waives
that
as
well.
maybe
that's
all
that
it
waived,
because...
although
you
say
that
congress
understood
that
the
rest
couldn't
be
sued
on.
maybe
congress
understood
the
rest
could
be
sued
on,
and
the
only
reason
they
added
this
was
so
you
could
get
the
fbi
agent
who
though
properly
supervised
goes
crashing
in
and
commits
an
intentional
tort.
justice
scalia
i
thought
the...
if
you
are
questioning
what
the
basis
of
the
government's
responsibility
here
would
be
if
it
wasn't
just
the
employment,
i
thought
what
they
are
contending
is
the
adoption
of
regulations,
which
perhaps
they
didn't
have
to
be
adopted,
but
the
government
was
a
volunteer,
and
of
course
it's
an
old
tort
theory
that
if
you
act
as
a
volunteer
you'd
better
do
it
right.
justice
scalia
mr.
wright,
i
am
trying
to
find
some
justification
for
the
panella
gloss
other
than
the
gloss
itself.
i'm
not
very
happy
with
the
notion
that
if
somebody
who
breaks
out
of
a
mental
institution
because
of
poor
supervision
is
a
government
employee
you
can't
sue
the
government
but
if
he
is
anything
other
than
a
government
employee
you
can.
that
seems
to
me
purely
an
accidental
distinction.
would
it
be
possible...
i
mean,
you
seem
to
be
resigned
to
the
gloss,
if
not
enthusiastic
about
it.
wouldn't
it
be
a
better
gloss
to
say
that
if
the
government's
negligence
consists
of
its
negligence
in
its
capacity
as
an
employer
versus
its
negligence
in
its
capacity
as
something
else,
why
couldn't
one
adopt
that
gloss
just
as
easily,
if
not
more
likely?
justice
scalia
more
than
adequate.
