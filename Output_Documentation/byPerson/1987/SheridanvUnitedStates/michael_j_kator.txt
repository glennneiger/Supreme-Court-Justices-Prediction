mr.
michael
j.
kator
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
statutory
construction
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
congress
intended
that
the
intentional
tort
exception
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
would
preclude
all
suits
from
which
the
government
negligently
failed
to
prevent
an
employee
from
committing
an
intentional
tort.
the
court
below
held
that
this
is
in
fact
what
congress
intended.
thus
the
court
below
sanctioned
a
construction
that
would,
for
example,
absolve
the
government
of
its
negligence
in
allowing
a
child
at
a
federally
run
day
care
center
to
be
molested
if
the
assailant
happened
to
be
a
federal
employee,
or
indeed
if
the
victim
couldn't
prove
that
the
assailant
was
other
than
a
federal
employee.
this
construction
would
also
absolve
the
government
of
liability
for
injuries
resulting
from
a
weapon
possessed
in
contravention
of
a
federal
hospital's
regulations
if
the
injuries
happened
to
be
intentionally
inflicted
and
if
the
assailant
happened
to
be
a
federal
employee.
this
construction
cannot
be
correct.
congress
could
not
have
intended
the
government's
liability
to
hinge
on
such
fortuitous
circumstances.
it
could
not
have
intended
to
create
the
fine
spun
and
capricious
distinctions
which
this
construction
requires.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
certainly,
your
honor.
that
is
essentially
the
position
that
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
took.
it
is
also
a
position
that
the
government
seems
to
endorse.
that
is
that
the
source
of
the
duty
controls
the
applicability
of
the
intentional
tort
exception.
in
the
day
care
center
case,
the
government
owes
its
duty
to
the
children
at
the
day
care
center,
not
because
it
may
or
may
not
employ
the
assailant,
but
because
it
has
chosen
to
run
a
day
care
center,
and
if
indeed
they
do
assume
this
task
voluntarily,
then
it
is
hornbook
law
that
they
must
use
due
diligence
in
performing
that
duty,
so
yes,
certainly
you
can
more
narrowly
define
it
and
say,
yes,
the
source
of
the
duty
determines
the
applicability
of
section
2680(h).
mr.
michael
j.
kator
not
at
all.
that
was
our
principal
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals.
duties
can
arise
in
one
of
two
says.
they
can
arise
directly
to
the
victim,
as
they
did
in
the
day
care
center
case,
where
we
have
children
and
we
will
watch
out
for
you,
or
they
can
arise
indirectly,
as
they
do
in
a
case
of,
for
example,
the
instances
the
government
cites,
where
we
have
to
control
a
mental
patient
who
is
dangerous.
the
government
owes
that
duty
to
whomever
that
mental
patient
may
come
across
and
injure,
so
it
owes
that
duty
indirectly,
but
either
way
it
owes
the
duty
to
the
victim,
and
that--
mr.
michael
j.
kator
--absolutely,
your
honor,
not
a
duty
which
grows
out
of
the
employment,
out
of
the
fact
of
employment
of
the
assailant,
but
simply
a
duty
imposed
by
state
law,
or,
as
in
the
day
care
center
case,
or
in
our
case,
by
the
promulgation
of
regulations,
a
duty
which
the
government
imposed
upon
itself.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
the
federal
tort
claims
act
would
impose
duty...
would
impose
liability
on
the
united
states
if
there
would
be
liability
in
maryland.
maryland
does
follow
the
doctrine
of
per
se
negligence
and
holds
that
if
regulations
or
statutes
are
adopted
for
the
protection
of
person
and
property
and
they
are
violated,
then
that
can
give
rise
to
an
action
for
negligence,
negligence
per
se.
but
you're
quite
right
in
saying
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
does
not
necessarily
create
the
negligence
per
se
claim.
we
did
principally
argue
in
the
court
below
that
it
was
the
source
of
the
duty
that
controlled,
but
we
also
argue
here,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
held,
that
indeed
the
statutory
language
is
broader
than
has
been
attributed
to
it
by,
for
example,
this
court
in
shearer.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
congress
intended
to
distinguish
between
intentional
torts
and
negligent
acts.
intentional
acts
were
excluded
from
coverage
and
negligent
ones
were
included,
and
that
is
the
distinction
that
the
ninth
circuit
held,
allowing
claims
for
what
are
characterized
as
negligent
supervision
to
go
forward,
while
saying,
no,
you
may
not
hold
the
government
responsible
under
the
theory
of
respondeat
superior
for
the
intentional
torts
of
its
agents.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
there
would
be
a
distinction
between
the...
if
i
understand
your
comment,
you
are
suggesting
that
2680(h)
is
somehow
broader
than
simply
for
assault.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
i
see.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
again
what
you
have
to
do
in
that
respect
is
go
back
into
the
historical
perspective
and
see
what
congress
was
considering
when
it
was
enacting
this
particular
provision.
and
what
it
was
looking
at
was
the
fact
that,
a,
there
was
a
distinction
between
negligent
supervision
and
intentional
torts,
and
b,
many
commentators,
some
states,
were
expanding
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
to
reach
intentional
torts
simply
as
a
matter
of
social
policy.
and
the
government
cites
and
we
cite
to
legislative
history
where
the
committee
is
stating,
let's
take
it
step
by
step.
let's
proceed
cautiously.
let's
forestall
adoption
of
the
liability
for
intentional
torts
until
considerable
experience
is
had
under
the
act,
and
we
submit
that
what
congress
was
talking
about
there
was
wanting
to
forestall
the
inclusion
of
respondeat
superior
for
intentional
torts
of
government
agents,
and
that
is
all
they
were
talking
about.
that
is
why
congress
saw
it
was
necessary
to
say
that,
because
some
states
do
allow
it.
the
congress
didn't
have
the
benefit,
obviously,
of
this
court's
decision
in
laird
versus
nelms.
it
may
have
assumed
that
these...
this
conduct,
wrongful
conduct
may
have
been
attributed
to
the
united
states.
so
that,
i
submit,
is
what
congress
was
after
in
adopting
that
language.
we
have
spoken
briefly
about
the
source
of
duty,
and
we
have
briefed
that
fully.
the
only
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
about
that
is
that
it,
unlike
any
of
the
analyses
the
government
has
put
forward,
is
consistent
with
underlying
tort
law,
which
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
modeled
after,
and
it
doesn't
have
the
internal
consistencies,
it
doesn't
have
all
the
exceptions
popping
up
that
we
have
to
navigate
our
way
around.
that
is
the
central
advantage
of
the
scope
of
the
duty
argument.
the
final
point
i
would
like
to
make
would
be
just
to
address
myself
briefly
to
the
government's
argument,
which
is
that
the
intentional
tort
exception
doesn't
apply
when
an
excluded
action
is
an
essential
element
of
the
claim.
that
argument
is
inconsistent
with...
first
of
all,
it's
inconsistent
with
panella,
which
says
that
federal
employees...
non-federal
employees
who
commit
intentional
torts,
that
is
not
outside
the
scope.
those
acts
are
just
as
essential
to
a
claim
as
would
be
the
claim
of
a
federal
employee
having
committed
that
identical
assault.
it
is
also
inconsistent
with
the
source
of
the
duty
argument
which
the
government
endorses.
there
is
no
reason
to
say
that
this
failing
to
control
a
prisoner
or
mental
patient
and
allowing
him
to
commit
assault
is
not
an
essential
element
of
a
claim
for
negligence.
that
doesn't
follow.
and
another
point
that
we
raised
in
our
brief
which
i
think
is
also
important
here
is
that
the
government
characterizes
the
language
as,
when
governmental
conduct
is
essential,
an
essential
element,
and
frankly,
we
don't
have
here
governmental
conduct.
what
we
have
here
is
conduct
of
an
individual
who
happens
to
be
a
federal
employee,
and
there
is,
quite
obviously,
a
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
sure.
there
would
have
to
be
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
government.
the
duty
on
the
part
of
the
government
here
arose
out
of
the
promulgation
of
regulations.
it
arose
out
of
three
of
its
agents
finding
this
particular
assailant
roaming
around
the
hospital
in
a
drunken
state,
brandishing
a
firearm.
that's
where
the
government's
duty
arose
in
this
case.
it
couldn't...
you
know,
at
least
it
wouldn't
seem
that
it
could
arise
in
a
private
hospital
with
private
employees
with
private
regulations.
certainly
a
claim
would
lie
against
the
private
hospital.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
exactly,
and
if
you
have
a
suit
against
the
hospital,
the
primary
motivation
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
as
made
clear
in
the
statutory
language,
was
to
hold
the
united
states
liable
in
situations
where
it
would
be
liable
if
it
were
a
private
citizen,
so
that
is
something
that
the
government
conceded
in
the
court
below,
that
indeed
all
the
facts
being
the
same
here,
if
this
were
a
private
individual
instead
of
the
government,
there
would
be
liability,
and
that's
crucial.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
what
i
submit
that
(h)
intended
to
do,
your
honor,
again
was
to
say,
you
may
have
respondeat
superior
liability
for
intentional
torts
in
this
state.
you
will
not
have
it
against
the
united
states.
we
are
simply
not
comfortable
with
that
potentially
limitless
incursion
of
liability
onto
the
united
states.
that's
what
we
submit.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
if
such--
mr.
michael
j.
kator
--we
made
two
arguments.
our
first
argument,
that
the
statute
is
that
broad,
yes,
that
would
be
a
viable
claim.
you
could
say
the
government
was
negligent
in
failing
to
prevent
this,
and
if
you
could
prove
it,
if
you
could
prove
that
the
government
was
negligent,
then
there's
no
reason
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
withhold
liability
in
that
situation.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
your
honor,
that's
correct.
it
arises
out
of
assault,
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
it
also
arose
out
of
antecedent
negligence,
then
you
could
say
that
it
arose
only
out
of
assault,
but--
mr.
michael
j.
kator
--what
the
statute
says
is,
"arising
out
of
assault",
and
what
arising
means,
if
you
look
in
the
dictionary,
which
is
the
first
place
we
must
look
when
we
are
construing
these
statutes,
arising
means
originate
or
spring
up.
this
claim,
this
injury,
even,
originated
in
the
government's
negligence.
that
was
the
first
step.
so
if
you're
going
to
look
at
arising
out
of
and
focus
very
narrowly
on
exactly
what
the
words
say,
then
we
submit
it
must
go
to
the
genesis
of
the
claim,
not
to
the
immediate
act
which
preceded
the
injury.
so,
no,
i
don't
see
that
our
reading
of
"arising
out
of"
is
in
any
way
inconsistent
with
congress's
intent
or
artificial
in
any
sense.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there's
no
question
that
the
assault
is
a
cause
in
fact.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
and
it
is
one
of
the
elements--
mr.
michael
j.
kator
--i
guess
my
answer
to
that
is,
it's
arising
out
of
in
the...
in
the
sense
that,
yes,
that
is
a
central...
it's
an
element
which
is
a
cause
in
fact,
but
my
interpretation
of
arising
out
of
says,
don't
look
at
the
most
immediate
act.
but
go
back
and
look
at
the
genesis
of
the
claim.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
well,
i'm
sure
that
there
are
some
limitations,
your
honor,
but
my
point
would
be
that
we
can
isolate
governmental
conduct,
which
is
a
cause
in
fact
of
this
injury,
and
the
first
negligent
governmental
act
presumably
is
where
the
claim
arises.
that
may
be
more
a
semantic
argument
than
anything
else,
because
principally
it's
clear
what
congress
was
after,
if
you
look
again
in
the
historical
perspective.
congress
was
trying
to
forestall
respondeat
liability
for
an
intentional
tort,
and
if
that
is
what
they're
doing,
then
it's
perfectly
acceptable
to
read
"arising
out
of"
as
the
genesis
of
which,
or
indeed
as
the
shearer
court
said,
read
it
as
for
assault,
because
that
is
indeed
what
congress
was
after.
i
think
unless
the
court
has
any
more
questions
i
might
answer,
i'll
just
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
well,
i
hope
i
won't
need
them
all,
your
honor,
but
i
guess
my
first
point
was,
i'm
sure
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
in
washington,
d.c.,
who
would
be
surprised
to
know
that
regulations
at
bethesda
naval
are
not
enacted
for
their
protection.
i
submit
that
they
are.
in
any
event,
that
is
a
question
for
the
district
court.
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
the
question,
what
if
the
assailant
had
been
an
fbi
agent,
what
would
be
the
liability
in
this
case,
and
the
government
said,
well,
if
he
is
an
fbi
agent,
therefore
you
could
sue
him
directly
for
his
intentional
tort.
i
don't
think
that
that's
correct.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1974
amendment
makes
it
quite
clear
that
congress
was
only
waiving
that
with
respect
to
fbi
agents,
law
enforcement
individuals
acting
within
the
scope.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
2680(h)
that
says
acting
within
the
scope,
yet
there
is
quite
a
bit
elsewhere
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
says
that.
i
believe
it
is
2674
and
1346(b)
certainly
says
within
the
scope.
you
asked
about
the
panella
gloss
and
where
does
it
come
from.
where
it
comes
from
is
reading
these
provisions
together.
there
is
nothing
in
2680(h)
admittedly
that
says
it
has
to
be
a
federal
employee
who
commits
the
intentional
tort,
but
it
is
all
over
1346(b)
and
it
is
all
over
the
rest
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
indeed,
what
congress
was
concerned
with
was
federal
employees
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
employment,
and
that's
the
gloss
that
needs
to
be
read
into
panella,
not
federal
employees,
not
people
who
happen
to
be
federal
employees,
but
people
who
are
federal
employees,
and
it
matters
that
they
are
a
federal
employee,
i.e.,
they
are
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
if
you
apply
that
gloss,
if
you
will,
you
end
up
where
we
submit
chief
judge
winter
was
in
the
court
below.
he
says,
if
there
is
an
independent
duty,
then
the
government
must
be
held
to
it.
now,
i
don't
want
to
forsake
my
argument
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
correct
because
i
believe
that
they
are.
historically,
if
you
look
at
it,
this
is
what
congress
was
up
to.
it
wanted
to
say,
no
respondeat
superior
for
intentional
torts.
that's
what
we're
after
in
2680(h).
negligent
claims
may
proceed.
that's
what
congress
was
doing.
but
you
know,
as
to
which
of
our
claims
survive
depending
on
which,
if
any,
of
these
arguments
the
court
adopts,
certainly
our
first
claim
of
the
navy
knew
or
should
have
known
that
this
man
posed
a
threat
would
not
be
able
to
survive
if
the
court
only
went
with
the
scope
of
the
duty.
the
scope
of
the
duty
would
focus
on
whether
there
is
a
duty
independent
of
the
employment
status,
and
that
would
be
gone
if
you
are
talking
about
duties
that
arise
solely
out
of
employment.
on
the
other
hand,
of
course,
if
you
go
with
the
ninth
circuit
approach,
the
broader
approach,
negligent
supervision
is
allowed.
there
is
no
reason
to
distinguish
between
the
two,
between
negligent
supervision
and
any
other
kind
of
tort
claim,
and
therefore
that
case
may
proceed.
those
are
our
two
principal
