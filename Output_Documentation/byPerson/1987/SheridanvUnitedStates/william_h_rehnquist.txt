william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
now
in
no.
87-626,
michael
sheridan
against
the
united
states.
we
will
wait
just
a
moment,
mr.
kator,
until
the
court
clears.
0....
very
well,
mr.
kator.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
are
talking
about
a
duty
imposed
by
state
law
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
suggest
the
promulgation
of
regulations
by
the
government
gives
rise
to
a
source
of
duty
independent
of
state
law.
even
if
you...
it
seems
to
me
you
can
win
this
case
and
still
not
be
correct
on
that
point.
it
may
be
that
the
law
of
maryland
would
say
that
government
regulations
make
someone
negligent
per
se
for
violating
them.
i
don't
know
if
the
federal
tort
claims
act
itself
creates
a...
imposes
a
duty
by
virtue
of
government
regulations.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
the
ninth
circuit
is
completely
right,
then
you
really
wouldn't
be
giving
full
meaning,
it
seems
to
me,
to
2680(h).
you
wouldn't
need
the
provision
that
the
waiver
of
governmental
tort
immunity
doesn't
apply
as
it
is
set
forth
there.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
an
exception
to
the
liability
imposed
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
makes
the
government
ordinarily
liable
for
negligence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so
if
there
wouldn't
be
liability
for
negligence
in
the
first
place
in
this
situation,
you
wouldn't
need
2680(h).
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if
he
had
been
in
a
private
hospital,
you
clearly...
and
had
done
the
same
things
he
did,
and
the
people
had
failed
to
restrain
him,
you
would
have
no
action
against
the
government,
you
concede,
don't
you,
even
though
he
is
in
the
service?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
would
have
a
suit
against
the
hospital
but
not
against--
chief
justice
rehnquist
except
when
they
use
the
term
"arising
out
of
assault",
you
are
giving
it
a
very,
very
narrow
meaning.
certainly
your
client's
claim
arises
out
of
assault.
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
about
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
statute
doesn't
say,
"arising
only
out
of
assault".
it
says,
"arises
out
of
assault".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kator.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
all
goes
for
the
basis
of
imposing
liability,
which
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
i
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
2680(h).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
kator,
you
have
14
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kator.
the
case
is
submitted.
