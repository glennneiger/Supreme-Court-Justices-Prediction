mr.
gerald
sawatzky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
questions
presented
in
this
case
are,
first,
whether
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
and
the
due
process
clause
require
kansas,
a
quorum
state,
to
apply
the
limitations
laws
of
the
states
of
texas,
oklahoma,
and
louisiana,
where
the
claims
arose
in
favor
of
class
members
residing
in
those
states,
and
secondly,
whether
kansas
has
failed
in
this
case
to
apply
the
interest
laws
of
those
same
states
to
those
claims
as
required
by
this
court's
decision
in
phillips
petroleum
company
versus
shutts,
which
was
an
identical
case
to
this
one
except
it
did
not
involve
the
limitations
issue.
sun
oil
sells
gas
from
wells
located
in
various
states
and
pays
royalty
to
landowners,
thousands
of
land-owners
located
in
these
states.
in
the
1970s
sun
had
received,
filed
for
and
received
price
increases
from
the
then
federal
power
commission
subject
to
refund
pending
a
determination
of
their
legality,
and
once
determined
to
be
legal,
royalty
was
paid
on
the
suspended
funds
representing
the
increases
to
the
royalty
owners,
and
such
payouts
were
made
in
july
of
1976
and
on
another
occasion
in
1978.
plaintiffs
filed
this
suit
in
august
of
1979
in
kansas
state
court
seeking
to
collect
interest
on
the
principal
payout
of
these
suspended
royalties
on
behalf
of
the
class
of
these
royalty
owners
located
in
these
various
states.
ninety-nine
percent
of
the
class
members
resided
in
states
other
than
kansas.
over
90
percent
of
the
wells
were
located
in
texas,
oklahoma,
and
louisiana.
now,
in
the
first
wortman
case
in
1984
the
kansas
courts
held
that
kansas
interest
law
should
be
applied
to
all
the
claims
in
all
the
states
and
also
held
that
the
kansas
limitations
statute,
which
it
determined
was
five
years,
should
apply
to
all
the
claims
in
all
the
states.
thereafter,
this
court
decided
phillips
versus
shutts
in
1985,
which
required
kansas
to
apply
the
interest
laws
of
the
other
states
to
the
claims
arising
in
those
states
if
those
laws
were
different,
and
it
pointed
out
they
probably
were
different.
on
sun's
petition
this
court
then
remanded
the
first
kansas
wortman
case
back
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
this
court's
case
of
phillips
versus
shutts.
and
on
reconsideration
the
kansas
court,
reviewing
many
decisions
in
these
other
states,
and
not
finding
anything
directly
on
point,
nevertheless
held
despite
this
court's
direction
that
the
kansas
theory
of
equitable
interest
would
be
uniformly
adopted
in
each
one
of
these
states.
then
on
the
limitations
question
when
we
again
raised
the
constitutional
objection
that
the
limitations
laws
were
substantive,
certainly
as
substantive
as
interest
laws,
where
the
difference
is
between
6
percent
and
10
percent,
between
liability
and
no
liability,
the
kansas
court
adopted
what
is
a
standard
black
letter
conflicts
rule
that
limitations
goes,
is
remedial
or
procedural,
therefore
the
law--
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
--your
honor,
the...
i
think
i--
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
--no,
your
honor.
those
states
follow
the
common
law
rule,
as
kansas
does,
as
most
states
do,
that
the
normal
statute
of
limitations
such
as
we
have
involved
here,
are
considered
procedural
or
remedial
for
conflict
of
laws
purposes.
that
does
not
mean
to
say
that
those
states
do
not
apply
those
laws
to
claims
arising
in
each
one
of
those
states
in
such
a
manner
as
to
terminate
completely
any
claim
or
cause
of
action
that
has
arisen
in
that
state.
and
my
whole
point,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the
nature
of
a
statute
of
limitations
when
it
is
applied
by
each
one
of
these
states
is
such
that
constitutionally
it
is
substantive
because
it
deprives
a
party
of
a
claim.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
i
think
that
in
applying
the
constitution,
your
honor,
we
must
look
at
what
a
statute
of
limitations
does
to
a
party
and
to
a
claim,
and
because
of
the
history,
the
common
law
history
by
which
this
common
law
fiction
arose,
a
fiction
that
limitations
goes
to
the
remedy
and
not
to
the
right,
which
arose
way
back
in
mclemoyle
versus
cohen.
prior
to
that
time,
justice
storey...
i
am
getting
back
into
history
now,
but
it
goes
right
to
the
very
essence
of
this
case.
and
that
is
that
justice
storey
in
leroy
versus
crowninshield
analyzed
this
common
law
fiction
and
from
every
aspect
he
concluded
in
effect
that
a
limitations
law
by
its
nature
was
substantive
because
it
affected
the
substantive
rights
of
the
claimant.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
no,
it
wasn't.
in
the
wells
case,
your
honor,
there
was
absolutely
no
reexamination
and
no
constitutional
analysis
of
limitations
statutes
or
their
purposes.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
yes.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
it
didn't
carry
the
day,
your
honor,
because
the
majority
opinion
in
wells
simply
rotely
adopted
the
old
mclemoyle
line
of
cases,
and
if
you
look
back
at
mclemoyle,
likewise
it
did
not
analyze
the
question.
one
would
think
that
before
we
rotely
adopt
an
old
rule
for
the
sake
of
old
times
and
antiquity
that
we
ought
to
look
at
the
reason
behind
the
rule
and
see
if
the
rule
stacks
up
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
our
constitution.
and
if
we
do
go
back,
you
will
note
that
mclemoyle
and
wells
recited
the
common
law
fiction
that
limitations
goes
to
the
remedy
and
not
to
the
right.
well,
that
is
pretty
well
accepted
by
scholars
that
that
remedy,
common
law
remedy
type
of
thing
was
basically
something
to
preserve
english
sovereignty
over
england's
people
and
its
courts.
now,
when
justice
storey,
really
the
only
analysis
made
in
the
early
days
was
by
justice
storey
in
the
crowninshield
case,
and
he
examined
it
by
reason
and
logic
and
said,
in
effect,
the
common
law
rule
is
wrong,
but
it
is
the
law,
and
i
will
apply
it
to
the
case,
but
that
case
did
not
involve
the
constitution.
and
if
you
come
to
the
constitution,
where
kansas
must
respect
the
laws
of
texas
which
affect
people's
rights,
and
like
any
other
substantive
law,
then
we
have
an
issue
which
is
not,
which
is
not
simply
a
question
of
the
common
law
of
england.
we
have
a
constitutional
purpose.
limitations--
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
--i
don't
really
think
you
have
to,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
be
the
best
thing--
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
--i
think
it
would
be
the
best
thing
that
this
court
could
do
to
overrule
them,
because
it
is
an
old
english
common
law
fiction
which
has
been
applied
without
discrimination.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
yes,
we
do.
we
have
the
ferens
case.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
the
third
circuit.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
they
said
that
constitutionally
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
and
the
due
process
clause
in
particular,
the
common
rule
in
effect,
the
common
law
rule
should
be
disregarded
because
one
state
should
apply
the
law
of
another
state.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
you
are
coming
to
one
aspect
of
my
case.
perhaps
i
bit
off
a
bigger
chunk
than
i
should
chew
by
saying
that
some
of
these
old
cases
are
wrong,
which
i
think
they
clearly
are,
but
in
keaton
versus
hustler
magazine,
this
court
said
under
a
due
process
analysis
it
would
reserve
the
question
of
whether
or
not
one
state
must
apply
the
limitations
law
of
another
state
where
the
forum
state's
only
connection
was
the
presence
of
a
suit,
the
bringing
of
a
suit.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
well,
yes.
that--
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
--there
had
absolutely
been
no
cases
discussing,
analyzing
the
due
process
clause
in
connection
with
this
problem.
the
wells
case
did
not
consider
it.
certainly
mclemoyle
didn't.
it
was
long
before
the--
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
--it
is
perfectly
open
and
right
here
for
this
court
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
well,
you
look
at
the
due
process
analysis
in
the
shutts
case
itself
and
in
the
cases
cited
by
shutts,
and
that
is
that
parties
are
entitled
to
expect
that
their
activities
and
their
rights
and
legal
obligations
will
be
governed
by
laws
of
the
jurisdiction
where
they
undertake
their
activities,
and
where
the
alleged
wrong
or
the
breach
occurs,
and
that
this
lends
predictability
to
the
law,
and
this
is
an
element
of
the
fairness
incorporated
in
and
an
absolute
part
of
the
due
process
clause.
fairness
that
the
parties
reasonably
expect
that
this
law
where
they
perform
their
activities
will
be
applied,
but
not--
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
the
statute
of
limitations,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
many
times
and
is
generally
recognized,
is
a
statute
of
repose
that
gives
people
certainty
in
their
affairs,
and
if
you
want
to
go
to
a
state
and
conduct
your
activities
with
a
limitation
of
two
or
three
years
instead
of
five
of
six
years,
that
is
your
option.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
well,
i
don't
think
anybody
has
made
a
study
out
of
it,
your
honor,
but
that
is
one
of
the
elements
that
goes
into
your
expectancy.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
well,
the
point
is,
though,
that
in
any
action
there
are
affirmative
defenses,
let's
say
unclean
hands
or
something
else.
normally
we
say
that
this,
because
this
law
affects
the
rights
of
the
parties,
affects
this
claim
in
this
case
substantively,
it
wipes
it
out,
or
it
increases
it,
therefore
it
is
subject
to
the
due
process
clause,
and
you
look
to
the
law
of
the
state
and
jurisdiction
that
has
an
interest
in
that.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
of
course,
in
our
case,
you
understand,
kansas
supplied
its
longer
statute,
not
a
shorter
statute--
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
--to
bar
something,
and
so
this
argument
technically
would
not
apply,
but...
and
so
i
wouldn't
need
to
rebut
that
particular
argument,
but
i
think
from
the
standpoint
of
logic
and
common
sense,
this
argument
which
has
been
made
does
not
bear
analysis,
because
the
interest
as
far
as
stale
claims
is
concerned,
the
parties
are
interested
in
it.
whether
or
not
there
is
evidence
in
this
case
that
has
been
lost
bears
upon
the
parties
and
upon
that
claim.
now,
our
courts
all
the
time,
every
day
handle
cases
where
the
evidence
is
difficult.
whether
a
statute
of
limitations
has
run
or
not
run
or
whether
any
evidence
has
been
lost
or
not
lost,
the
state
where
this
occurs
does
not
have
an
interest
in
the
freshness
or
the
staleness
of
that
claim
per
say
because
of
all
these
factors.
the
interest
and
the
impact
is
upon
the
parties.
professor
loeffler,
who
has
been
involved
in
this
situation
and
studied
this
for
many,
many
years,
succinctly
summarizes
it
in
the
mercer
law
review
article
which
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief,
where
the
uniform
commissioners
on
state
laws
studied
the
problem,
and
back
in
the
fifties
they
proposed
a
uniform
rule
that
the
shorter
statute
would
apply,
adopting
this
very
argument
that
the
chief
justice
has
mentioned.
but
this
turned
out
to
be
very
unsatisfactory,
and
his
analysis
in
this
article
and
by
the
commissioners
showed
the
weaknesses
in
that,
just
as
i
think
that
i
have
tried
very
poorly
to
mention.
and
as
a
result
they
adopted,
they
concluded
that,
yes,
limitations
laws
are
substantive,
and
because
they
are
substantive,
the
law
which
should
be
applied
in
our
uniform
law
proposal
is
that
you
look
to
the
law
just
like
any
other
substantive
law
of
the
state
where
the
activity
occurred
and
the
claim
arose.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
that
is
correct.
that
is
what
they
concluded.
they
disregarded
or
they
discarded
what
they
had
formerly
proposed,
and
they
studied
this,
and
they
know
about
it.
now,
the
same
thing
has
occurred
in
england
that
gave
rise
to
this
whole
problem
and
has
led
to
all
this
inconsistency
and
all
this
quorum
shopping
which--
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
--yes,
sir.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
his
function
and
his
role,
your
honor,
was
in
the
conflict
of
laws
area,
and
was
proposing
that
as
a
uniform
rule.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
but
if
you
read
the
article
and
read
the
study,
and
similar
scholars,
and
conclude,
your
honor,
that
this
is
substantive,
that
they
are
correct
in
saying
it
is
substantive,
once
you
say
it
is
substantive,
our
constitution
requires
us
to
apply
it
in
that
manner.
their
role
is
not
to
take
over
the
function
of
this
court.
their
role--
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
--i
would
still
say,
your
honor,
that
that
would
apply.
number
one...
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
texas
doesn't
really
say
that.
they
may
say
it
is
procedural,
but
that
is
because
of
this
old
common
law
fiction.
and
secondly,
if
they
did
go
further
and
say
that
because
it
is
procedural
it
affects
our
ability
to
handle
these
claims--
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
--in
the
statute.
i
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional
because
it
would
not
reflect
reality,
because
the
reality
is
that
the
administrative
upkeep
of
the
courts,
the
procedure
in
the
courts
is
not
really
affected
by
whether
a
statute
is
longer
or
shorter.
and
professor
loeffler
points
that
out
very
well.
and
if
you
assume
that
what
i
am
saying
is
correct,
and
i
think
it
is
correct,
then
a
state's
artificially
saying
that
something
is
true
that
is
not
true
cannot
possibly
govern
the
operation
of
our
constitution.
so
we
come
again
to
the...
i
was
mentioning
the
law
of
england
that
gave
rise
to
this
whole
problem.
the
law
commission
made
a
study
and
concluded,
yes,
limitations
laws
by
their
nature
are
substantive.
therefore
the
law
in
england
now
is,
pursuant
to
parliament,
that
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
occurrence
happened
or
the
claim
arose
governs,
whether
longer
or
shorter,
when
the
action
is
brought
in
england.
now,
there
are
also
movements
under
foot
to
revise
the
restatement
of
contracts,
conflicts,
second,
section
142,
which
recognizing
this
problem,
because
you
see,
in
the
ferens
case,
when
the
ferens
case,
the
third
circuit
held
that
this
basically
was
a
constitutional
problem,
and
we
had
a
situation
where
an
accident
in
pennsylvania
and
barred
by
the
pennsylvania
statute
was
brought
in
mississippi,
where
they
have
a
longer
statute,
in
federal
court.
so
it
is
brought
in
federal
court,
and
the
consequence
of
our
old
common
law
rule
was
that
it
is
procedural
and
therefore
you
apply
the
law
of
misssippi,
which
was
six
years.
well,
then
under
the
forum
non
conveniens
statute
you
bounce
it
back
to
federal
court
in
pennsylvania,
where
it
was
barred,
of
course,
if
it
had
been
brought
there
by
the
statute,
and
suddenly
you
have
a
claim
that
is
alive
in
pennsylvania
that
was
really
dead
in
pennsylvania,
and
this
points
out
the
whole
illogic
and
irrationality
of
this
common
law
fiction
that
says
that
a
claim
which
is
dead
and
unenforceable
in
the
state
which
created
it,
and
it
is
one,
nevertheless
lives
and
survives
well
in
any
state
that
fortuitously
may
have
or
later
enact
a
longer
statute
of
limitations,
and
allow
this
kind
of
forum
shopping
and
hopscotching
among
the
states
in
litigation
to
occur.
and
this
is
especially
a
problem
in
class
actions
such
as
this
particular
case,
because
what
we
will
have
is
a
forum
state
that
has
a
law
favorable
to
one
particular
class
or
one
particular
interest,
so
a
class
action
will
migrate
to
that
state,
and
that
state
will
then
with
the
longer
statute
apply
the
law
everywhere
and
perhaps
apply
its
own
law
to
the
other
states
like
kansas
has
here
and
become
a
magnet
state
and
a
state
which
applies
national
law
which
it
creates.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
if
a
state
were
to
design
a
statute
of
limitations
so
that
it
would
bear
a
real
relationship
to
lost
evidence
and
to
stale
claims
and
which
could
demonstrably
improve
the
administration
of
cases
in
this
court,
that
might
be
one
thing.
but
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
we
just
have
general
statutes
of
limitations
which
by
their
nature
are
statutes
of
repose
for
the
benefit
of
people
because
we
live
in
a
world
of
time
and
space
where
we
draw
lines
on
the
map
that
give
jurisdiction,
and
we
draw
lines
in
time
which
say
we
go
on
to
something
new,
and
people
are
entitled
to
rely
on
that.
and
it
is
important
in
civilization,
ever
since
the
early
17th
century
under
the
king
james
statutes,
which
originated
most
of
these
statutes
of
limitations,
and
the
way
they
operate
is
to
operate
substantively.
scholars
generally--
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
--this
again
is
a
combination
of
objects
by
the
state.
for
example,
libel
and
slander
might
be
one
year
in
most
states
but
two
years
or
longer
in
some
other
states,
even
though
the
evince
of
libel
may
be
maintained
for
years
and
years,
but
there
is
something
about
the
public
policy
entitling
people
to
repose,
and
saying
to
people
that
have
claims
and
know
about
them,
you
assort
these
in
a
certain
time
or
they
are
lost,
and
the
defendant,
the
other
party
is
entitled
to
be
free
and
go
about
his
business
and
not
worry
about
it.
and
there
are
different
times
for
different
types
of
activities,
different
wrongs
or
different
breaches
of
contract.
so
again
these
are
for
the
substantive
repose
of
the
litigants
and
to
allow
life
to
go
on,
and
they
are
substantive
because
they
affect
the
particular
claim.
they
terminate
it
entirely
when
it
is
applicable.
now,
under
the
present
rule,
procedural
rule
we
can
bring
a
case
in
nevada,
for
example,
against
the
howard
hughes
estate
and
be
barred
by
limitations
by
the
claim
arising
there,
but
the
plaintiff
then
may
march
over
to
texas
and
bring
an
action
and
say,
you
have
a
longer
statute,
and
i
am
not
barred
by
the
judgment
there.
you
not
only
do
not
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
limitations
law,
but
you
don't
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
judgment
because
it
didn't
bar
it
on
the
merits.
it
was
just
procedural.
and
then
if
texas
for
some
reason
should
find
it
barred,
you
jump
over
to
another
state.
now,
that's
an
actual
case
cited,
from
texas,
cited
by
respondents,
and
this
business
of
substance
and
procedure
is
just
an
awful
mess.
now,
i
am
not
proposing
that
this
court
need
to
get
involved
in
delineating
when
a
state
for
its
own
purposes
may
call
something
procedural
or
substantive.
statutes
of
limitation
by
their
nature
are
substantive,
and
constitutionally
under
due
process
under
the
ferens
case,
under
the
expectations
of
the
parties
under
the
due
process
clause,
they
are
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
law
of
the
state,
that
bundle
of
substantive
rights
which
was
created
in
that
state
where
that
claim
arose.
now,
the
schreiber
case...
excuse
me,
the
i
mentioned
the
ferens
case
and
i
was
really
thinking
of
the
schreiber
case
in
the
tenth
circuit
before
where
the
schreiber
case
allowed
the
action
to
be
perpetuated
in
kansas
when
it
was
barred
in
kansas
by
being
filed
in
mississippi.
in
the
ferens
case,
they
said
you
can't
do
that,
you
can't
jump
over
to
mississippi
and
come
back
to
pennsylvania
and
let
the
case
continued
because
the
constitution
requires
that
you
look
to
the
law
where
the
claim
arose
and
prevent
this
kind
of
nonsense,
jumping
back
and
forth
between
the
states
and
applying
hit
or
miss,
fortuitously
somebody's
jurisdiction's
longer
statute
of
limitations.
now,
i
have
mentioned
the
lack
of
finality.
it
is
an
object
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
of
course,
in
particular
to
obtain
finality
in
litigation,
as
this
court
has
held,
justice
white
in
particular.
another
thing
that
has
happened
as
a
result
of
this
old
mclemoyle
rule
is
that
borrowing
statutes
were
created
by
the
states
because
there
was
a
constitutional
void.
it
doesn't
seem
right,
this
whole
mess
did
not
seem
right
to
many
states,
and
they
enacted
borrowing
statutes
to
apply
the
statutes
of
limitations
of
these
other
states.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
yes,
there
is.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
i
am
going
to
argue
that
right
now,
your
honor.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
because
the
kansas
court
on
remand
after
being
directed
by
this
court
to
look
to
the
laws
of
these
other
states...
i
will
mention
texas
as
a
prime
example.
in
texas
the
stahl
case
held
in
exactly
this
kind
of
a
case
that
the
texas
statutory
6
percent
rate
applied.
the
stahl
case
cited
the
shutts
case
in
kansas
as
a
case
awarding
interest.
the
stahl
case
mentioned
the
higher
federal
rate
of
interest
in
the
federal
statute
but
it
did
not
adopt
the
higher
rate
that
kansas
had
proposed
in
its
shutts
case,
which
the
texas
court
cited.
it
did
not
adopt
the
higher
federal
rate
from
the
federal
statute
which
kansas
had
adopted.
and
no
case
since
then
has
done
so.
there
is
no
law
in
texas
that
says
in
this
case
or
in
this
kind
of
a
case
a
rate
higher
than
6
percent
applies,
and
yet
kansas
under
the
guise
of
predicting
that
the
texas
courts
would
adopt
the
kansas
theory
if
presented
to
it,
said
we
will
apply
the
same
law
in
texas
because
we
think
that's
what
they
would
find.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
the
rate
that
kansas
found
was
the
federal
rate,
a
rate
that
ranged
up
to
18
to
20
percent.
mr.
gerald
sawatzky
yes,
they
did.
