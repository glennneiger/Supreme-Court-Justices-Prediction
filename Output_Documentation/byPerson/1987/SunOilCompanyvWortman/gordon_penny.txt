mr.
gordon
penny
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
consider
these
interesting
and
important
choice
of
law
questions,
and
they
are
difficult
and
subtle,
and
they
should
not
be
regarded
lightly.
but
i
think
it's
important
not
to
become
so
deeply
involved
in
the
intricacies
of
the
choice
of
law
that
we
lose
sight
of
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case,
and
in
my
opinion
the
fundamental
question
is,
are
our
courts,
our
institutions
of
justice
capable
of
redressing
an
enormous
interstate
ripoff
by
a
large
national
corporation
at
the
expense
of
about
3,000
people
located
in
several
states,
or
does
the
expense
of
individual
suits
and
the
fact
that
the
victims
are
located
in
many
of
the
states
mean
that
the
courts
can
do
little
for
them,
and
that
the
defendant
can
take
and
use
their
money
with
no
real
fear
of
accounting?
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that
sun
used
money
belonging
to
the
plaintiff
class
members
for
several
years
and
paid
no
compensation
for
its
use.
this
is
money...
is
not
money
that
sun
thought
they
might
own.
it
was
money
which
sun
never
could
own.
it
either
belonged
to
the
royalty
owners,
our
clients,
or
it
had
to
be
refunded
back
to
pipeline.
mr.
gordon
penny
i
believe
you
are
right,
justice
o'connor.
i
will
get
on
to
that.
mr.
gordon
penny
yes,
i
do.
mr.
gordon
penny
yes,
i
do,
justice
o'connor,
if
kansas
did
not
have
enough
other
contacts
with
the
litigation
to
make
its
application
of
its
own
statute
of
limitations
reasonable.
i
think
the...
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
now
about
substantive
and
procedural.
i
am
not
sure
that
the
labels
are
very
important
here,
but
they
are
more
than
labels,
and
this
is
evident
by
the
fact
that
when
you
get
a...
when
the
case
is
dismissed
because
it
is
brought
too
late
for
the
statute
of
limitations,
when
it
is
an
outlawed
claim,
that
is
not
treated
anywhere
that
i
am
aware
of
as
a
judgment
on
the
merits.
statutes
of
limitations
have
been
considered
procedural
rather
than
substantive
because
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
substance
of
the
lawsuit,
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it
is
just
or
unjust.
they
are
just
either
too
old
or
still
fresh
enough
to
try.
substantive
laws
governing
liability
have
entirely
to
do
with
whether
a
claim
is
just
or
unjust.
i
guess
statutes
of
limitation
in
that...
in
their
application
are
completely
arbitrary.
they
draw
a
line...
in
this
case
sun
says
we
are
approximately
two
months
too
late
on
a
part
of
the
claims
in
this
case.
they
don't
allege
that
they
are
damaged
in
any
way
by
our
two-month
delay.
the
records
have
not
gone
anywhere.
witnesses
haven't
died.
their
computers
haven't
burnt
up.
there
is
no
damage.
but
that
is
the
way
statutes
of
limitations
work.
the
attack
on
kansas'
application
of
its
own
statutes
of
limitation
is
made
on
a
couple
of
different
grounds,
and
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
ground
first.
as
i
read
the
cases
of
this
court,
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
not
require
kansas
to
apply
the
statute
of
limitations
of
another
state.
in
hague
versus
allstate
and
phillips
versus
shutts
this
court
determined
what
modest
restrictions
there
are
on
the
state's
application
of
its
own
substantive
law.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
application
of
a
law
which
is
part
of
the
state's
policy,
part
of
the
state's
machinery
for
regulating
its
judicial
process
that
the
restrictions
on
the
state's
actions
should
be
even
more
modest.
due
process
of
law
as
mr.
sawatzky
discussed
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
expectation
of
the
parties,
and
for
the
last
150
years
i
suppose
any
reasonably
well
informed
potential
litigant
in
this
country
would
expect
that
the
statute
of
limitations
of
the
forum
would
apply
in
any
lawsuit
brought
against
that
person.
mr.
gordon
penny
well--
mr.
gordon
penny
--it
is
not
a
disadvantage
as
far
as
i
am
concerned.
it
is
somewhat
of
a
circular
argument,
and
i
acknowledge
that.
it
seems
like
there
are
a
lot
of
them
in
this
area.
mr.
gordon
penny
you
say
and
others?
mr.
gordon
penny
oh,
i
see.
it
simply
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
kansas
is
required
by
the
constitution
to
surrender
control
over
its
own
courts
to
other
states.
and
that
is
what
we
would
have
if
kansas
is
required
to
apply
statutes
of
limitations
of
other
states.
kansas
has
interests
in
this
case
which
make
application
of
its
statutes
of
limitation
and
other
procedural
rules
reasonable
rather
than
unreasonable.
i
think
in
the
administration
of
its
court
system
there
is
a
whole
package
of
procedural
rules.
i
think
kansas
has
an
interest
in
maintaining
the
integrity
of
this
package
and
of
the
scheme
which
it
as
a
sovereign
state
has
in
regulating
litigation
in
its
own
courts.
it
has
an
interest
in
regulating
sun
oil
company,
which
is
qualified
to
do
business
and
does
do
business
in
kansas.
i
think
there
is
an
interest
here
in
cooperating
with
other
states
to
furnish
a
forum
where
this...
where
these
3,000
approximately
claims
can
be
litigated
in
one
action
that
would
save
judicial
resources
and
simplify
the
task.
and
of
course
kansas
has
an
interest
in
regulating
the
oil
and
gas
business
which
is
an
important
commercial
activity
in
kansas.
the
other
prong
of
the
attack
is
full
faith
and
credit,
and
as
i
understand
this
attack
on
kansas...
on
the
application
of
the
forum
statute
of
limitations,
is
that
it
somehow
impairs
other
states'
interests
or
offends
other
states
in
the
union.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
this
can
be
when
the
other
states
involved
here
consider
their
statutes
of
limitations
to
be
procedural.
they
affect
only
the
remedy.
none
of
the
other
states
cancelled
sun's
debt.
louisiana,
perhaps,
where
we
concede
the
statute
of
limitations
had
expired
on
the
part
of
the
claims.
louisiana
didn't
cancel
sun's
debt.
louisiana
simply
says,
we
consider
this
a
claim
for
rent.
we
have
historically
applied
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations.
you
are
more
than
three
years.
sometimes
this
state's...
the
state's
interest
in...
sometimes
it
is
hard
to
tell
what
a
state's
policy
might
be
from
the
statute
or
what
the
intention
was,
but
when
oklahoma,
one
of
the
states
involved
here,
adopted
the
uniform
statute
of
limitations
on
foreign
claims...
i
believe
that
was
in
the
fifties...
this
was
a
uniform
act
that
was
not
universally
popular.
only
three
states,
including
oklahoma,
ever
adopted
it.
and
its
general
scheme
was
to
make
the
shorter
statute
of
limitations
apply
to
bar
the
claim.
however,
when
oklahoma
adopted
this
uniform
law,
they
took
out
one
word
and
inserted
another
to
make
it
mean
that
when
the
statute
of...
the
statute
of
limitations
shall
be
either
that
prescribed
by
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
claim
accrued
or
by
the
law
of
this
state,
whichever
last
bars
the
claim.
oklahoma
was
there
expressing
in
that
context
their
policy
and
decision
that
whichever
last
bars
the
claim
should
prevail.
mr.
gordon
penny
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
gordon
penny
apparently
so.
as
this
court
has
said,
the
statute
of
limitations
represents
a
policy
about
the
privilege
to
litigate.
the
shelter
of
the
statute
of
limitations
in
such
a
way
as
to
benefit
a
potential
defendant
is
simply
a
by-product
or
a
fall-out
of
that.
i
think
this
is
recognized
intuitively,
and
it
has
been
recognized
specifically
by
this
court.
we
have
a
question
in
petitioner's
brief
as
to
this
being
nonsense
to
have
a
right
without
a
remedy.
this
has
been
with
us
a
long
time,
and
i
think
the
courts
have
always
recognized
this.
rights
without
remedies
are
of
some
good.
they
can
be
offset.
they
do
furnish
consideration
for
a
new
promise
to
pay.
there
may
be
a
change
of
state
policy,
in
which
case
your
remedy
comes
alive
again,
as
in
the
chase
securities
case
cited
in
our
briefs.
these
cases
we
do
not
believe
are
barred
by
either
texas
or
oklahoma
law
if
those
states'
laws
were
to
apply.
we
cite
in
our
brief
the
longer
statutes
of
limitations
of
those
states,
that
is,
the
statutes
dealing
with
recovery
on
written
contracts.
these
are
on
written
contracts,
the
oil
and
gas
leases.
although
our
recovery
was
probably
based
more
on
the
theory
of
unjust
enrichment,
it
was
unjust
enrichment
by
sun
keeping
the
money
it
owed
our
clients
under
the
written
contracts
for
longer
than
it
should
have.
maybe
one
of
the
thorniest
problems
in
this
case
is
the
kansas
courts'
determination
of
the
other
states'
law.
when
this
case
was...
not
this
case,
when
the
companion
case,
phillips,
was
here
before
the
majority
opinion
questioned
the
kansas
courts'
finding
all
the
law
the
same.
kansas
has
looked
at
these
substantive
laws
of
the
other
states
again
and
has
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
typically,
historically
a
decision
of
this
type
by
a
state
court
has
been
entitled
to
great
respect
from
this
court,
and
there
are,
i
think,
good
reasons
for
that.
sometimes
it
is
very
difficult
for
a
state
court
to
decide
what
a
neighboring
state
court
might
do
if
faced
with
a
particular
fact
situation.
maybe
there
is
no
clearcut
answer.
it
has
to
be
decided,
though,
and
the
question
is,
once
it
is
decided,
does
another
court
then
second
guess
or
look
again?
the
law--
mr.
gordon
penny
--yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
penny
yes,
the
stahl
case
was...
which
did
apply
6
percent
interest,
was
an
unusual
case.
that
was
all
that
stahl
ever
asked
for
in
that
case.
it
was...
it
was
a
declaratory
judgment
action
brought
by
phillips,
the
oil
company,
which
had
paid
stahl
certain
principal
amounts.
phillips
requested
a
judgment
that
it
was
not
liable
for
any
interest
on
the
amounts
already
paid
out,
and
in
addition
also
asked
for
that
money
back.
stahl
counterclaimed
for
6
percent
interest,
and
it
was
allowed
by
the
court.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
he
ever
asked
for
any
more.
in
addition
to
the
stahl
case
there
have
been
in
texas
a
great
ferment
of
cases
involving
prejudgment
interest
since
the
stahl
case
was
decided.
they
are
cited
in
our
brief,
but
cavnar
versus
quality
control
parking
is
one
of
the
cases
in
which
the
texas
supreme
court
said,
from
now
on
our...
in
cases
of
this
type
we
are
going
to
have
prejudgment
interest,
and
it
will
be
at
the
same
rate
as
the
legislative...
as
the
statute
on
postjudgment
interest
presently
is.
mr.
gordon
penny
yes,
sir,
personal
injury.
and
then
later
there
is
a...
there
are
several
more
texas
courts...
court
of
appeals
cases,
some
going
both
ways.
february
10th,
the
texas
court
decided
a
case
called
perry
roofing
company
versus
olcott,
which
is
in
a
supplemental
brief
which
i
believe
was
filed
yesterday,
in
which
the
texas
supreme
court
cleared
the
question
up
and
said,
we
will...
unless
you
can...
well,
let
me
back
up
a
little
bit.
their
ruling
was,
if
you
have
a
case
on
a
contract,
and
by
looking
at
the
face
of
the
contract
you
can
tell
how
much
money
is
due
on
the
contract,
then
their
6
percent
interest
rate
applies.
they
have
judicially
limited
the
application
of
that
6
percent
statute.
on
all
other
cases,
as
i
understand
the
texas
ruling,
they
are
granting
prejudgment
interest
at
a
rate
corresponding
to
the
bank
prime
rate
compounded
daily.
this
is
strictly
by
the
action
of
the
texas
supreme
court,
and
the
cavnar
case,
i
believe,
was
1985.
all
those
cases
are
in
our
brief.
i
think
if
the
kansas
court
missed
the
application,
missed
the
mark
on
the
texas
law,
it
didn't
miss
it
by
very
far.
the
federal
power
commission
rate
which
the
kansas
court
found
applicable
is
also
based
on
the
bank
prime
rate,
and
it
is
a
floating
rate,
though,
rather
than
being
set
at
the
date
of
judgment
as
is
the
texas
rule
under
cavnar.
in
louisiana
there
has
been
new
legislation
which
would
indicate
the
kansas
court
was
not
far
off
the
mark
there
either.
mr.
gordon
penny
i
would
say
that
the
prediction
missed
by
some
amount.
louisiana
civil
code
article
2000...
this
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
is
in
the
latest
kansas
case
of
phillips
versus
shutts,
shutts
versus
phillips,
louisiana
civil
code
article
2000,
a
statute
on
prejudgment
interest
which
is
declared
to
be
retrospective
and
prospective
adopted
effective
january
1
of
1985
calls
for
12
percent
interest
on
money
due
in
louisiana
if
there
is
no
other
contract.
maybe
the...
if
the
kansas
court
missed
the...
missed
the
prediction
by
a
ways
on
the
louisiana
substantive
rate
of
interest,
it
did
the
same
as
the
federal
courts
did
boutte
versus
chevron,
which
were
federal
cases
involving
exactly
this
same
type
of
money.
it
came
up
in
louisiana
and
the
federal
courts
there
said...
this
was
at
a
time
when
chevron
still
held
the
money
and
hadn't
paid
it
out.
in
fact,
the
rate
increases
were
not
yet
final.
the
landowners
were
trying
to
collect
the
money
before
the
rate
increases
were
final.
mr.
gordon
penny
well,
your
honor,
i
think
probably
the
way
to
finality
of
judgments
is
to
affirm
if
a
good
faith
effort
was
made
by
the
court
to
arrive
at
what
the
other
state's
court
law
is.
mr.
gordon
penny
right.
mr.
gordon
penny
yes,
it
was.
this
12
percent
statute
had
been
adopted,
was
adopted--
mr.
gordon
penny
--no.
no,
i
will
agree
with
that.
it
is
not
the
code.
mr.
gordon
penny
the
texas
law,
the
cavnar
case,
i
believe,
came
down
in
1985.
mr.
gordon
penny
yes.
and
the--
mr.
gordon
penny
--the
texas
supreme
court
judgment
applying
it
to
all
types
of
cases
or
really
confirming
that
it
applies
to
all
types
of
cases
just
came
last
month.
mr.
gordon
penny
yes,
it
was
after
the
cavnar
case.
mr.
gordon
penny
okay.
oklahoma
has...
i
am
honestly
embarrassed
that
this
statute
is
not
cited
in
our
brief.
oklahoma
has
a
statute.
it
is
not
6
percent,
but
it
is
12
percent.
it
is
a
statute
specifically
dealing
with
late
payments
of
oil
and
gas
royalties,
and
it
has
been
around
since
1980.
it
is
title
52,
section
540.
mr.
gordon
penny
the
kansas
court
applied
the
federal
rule
to--
mr.
gordon
penny
--yes.
mr.
gordon
penny
no,
i
don't
think
it's...
i
don't
think
it's
that
clear,
justice
scalia.
in
this
case--
mr.
gordon
penny
--yes,
i
think
it
was
a
good
faith
effort,
and
i
think
if
one
of
these
cases
comes
before
one
of
the
other
courts,
texas,
oklahoma,
or
louisiana,
i
think
it's
quite
likely
they
would
do
exactly
as
the
kansas
court
did.
mr.
gordon
penny
yes.
mr.
gordon
penny
i
think
that
would
make
it
more
difficult.
however,
kansas
had
a
general
interest
rate
statute
as
well
which
the
kansas
court
decided
not--
mr.
gordon
penny
--title
52,
section
540.
mr.
gordon
penny
it
was
not,
your
honor,
and
maybe
this
is
incompetence
on
our
part.
mr.
gordon
penny
yes.
mr.
gordon
penny
they
claimed
6
percent.
oklahoma
has
a
general
statute
or
a
general
interest
state
of
6
percent.
mr.
gordon
penny
yes,
sir.
i
have
been
talking
all
throughout
about
prejudgment
interest,
and
the
only
place
the--
mr.
gordon
penny
--yes,
there
was
that
claim
made.
mr.
gordon
penny
it
would
be,
especially
with
respect
to
oklahoma,
the
claim
was
made
that
there
would
be
no
prejudgment
interest.
mr.
gordon
penny
yes.
i
think
that
would
be
very
difficult
to
maintain
inside
of
the
particular
statute
they
have
on
there,
and
again,
i--
mr.
gordon
penny
--i
was
not
aware
of
the
statute
until
yesterday.
mr.
gordon
penny
no.
it
was
never
cited
to
any
court
considering--
mr.
gordon
penny
--the
louisiana
statute
was
cited
by
the
kansas
court
in
the
shutts
versus
phillips
case.
mr.
gordon
penny
in
this...
the
kansas
court's
opinion
in
this
case
referred...
mostly
just
referred
to
the
shutts
case,
which
had
been
decided
a
month
earlier.
mr.
gordon
penny
there
was
a
case
in
louisiana
called
boutte
versus
chevron,
in
which
the
federal
court
said,
whenever
this
money
is
paid
out...
it
was
dicta
in
the
case,
but
the
federal
court
did
say,
chevron,
you
don't
have
to
pay
the
money
out
until
the
rates
become
final,
but
when
you
do
pay
the
money
out,
you
will
pay
them
to
the
royalty
owners
at
the
same...
together
with
the
same
rate
of
interest
as
you
are
required
to
by
your
federal
power
commission
undertaking.
there
was
also
a
federal
court
case
in
texas,
sid
richardson
oil
and
gas
company,
in
which
the
federal
judge
said
the
same
thing,
that
when
the
money
goes
out
it
will
go
out
with
the
same
rate
of
interest.
here
i
think
the
court
has
two
options
on
this
determination
of
other
states'
law.
one
would
be
to
affirm
the
kansas
decision
which
is
made
in
good
faith.
whether
it
is
exactly
like
state
law
turns
out
to
be
two
or
three
years
later
or
a
year
or
two
later
probably
doesn't
happen
very
often,
even
when
a
federal
court
predicts
what
a
state
court
is
going
to
decide,
or
a
federal
court
predicts
what
another...
a
neighboring
state
court
will
decide.
the
other
option,
i
think,
would
be
to
find
that
the
kansas
determination
was
erroneous,
although
i
submit
by
a
very
small
amount,
and
enter
judgment
for
interest
in
accord
with
the
oklahoma
statute,
the
texas
cavnar
rule
on
prejudgment
interest,
and
the
louisiana
civil
code
section.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
will
finish.
