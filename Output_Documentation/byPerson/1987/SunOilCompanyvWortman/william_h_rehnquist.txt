chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
87-352,
sun
oil
company
versus
richard
wortman
and
hazel
moore.
mr.
sawatzky,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
part
of
a
favorable
climate
for
business,
perhaps?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
one
can
certainly
make
the
argument
in
the
case
of
the
statute
of
limitations
that
the
primary
interest
it
serves
is
that
of
a
state,
the
state's
court
system
in
not
trying
to
process
stale
claims
which
are
very
difficult
to
figure
out
who
is
right
and
who
is
wrong,
and
that
if
texas
feels
they
want
a
shorter
statute
of
limitations,
it
is
a
state
interest
there
that
is
being
vindicated,
but
if
the
kansas
court
system
feels
they
don't
have
that
same
reservation,
then
why
not
let
kansas
apply
its
longer
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
get
different
statutes
of
limitations
in
the
same
state,
depending
on
whether
it
is
personal
injury,
trespass
to
real
property,
personal
property,
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sawatzky.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
penny.
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
by
that
standard
you
would
never
be
able
to
overrule
any
case
that
says
old
process
is
due
process,
in
effect,
because
people
are
used
to
living
under
that
regimen.
chief
justice
rehnquist
perhaps
that
is
not
a
disadvantage.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
opinion
is
june
8th,
1987.
that
should
be
after
the
texas
case
you
refer
to,
the
cavnar
case,
shouldn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
see.
how
about
oklahoma?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
penny.
the
case
is
submitted.
