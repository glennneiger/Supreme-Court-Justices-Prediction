predictability
is
important
when
you
are
going
to
govern
your
actions
by
it.
justice
scalia
but
how
do
you
govern
your
actions
differently
if
you
know
that
there
is
a
five-year
statute
of
limitations
rather
than
a
nine-year
one?
do
you
make
time
go
faster
or
make
it
go
slower?
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
about
a
statute
of
limitations.
it
doesn't
affect
your--
justice
scalia
--do
you
think
anybody
ever
conducted
affairs
in
one
state
versus
another
because
they
knew
they
had
a
shorter
statute...
do
people
really
advert
to
statutes
of
limitations
when
they
conduct
their
primary
conduct?
i
can't
imagine
that.
justice
scalia
mr.
sawatzky,
what
do
you
do
with
texas
itself
says
when
it
enacts
its
statute
of
limitations:
the
reason
we
have
these
statute
of
limitations
is,
we
don't
think
our
courts
can
find
the
facts
very
accurately
or
efficiently
when
the
claims
are
older
than
this.
now,
if
other
courts
want
to
take
a
shot
at
it,
if
they
think
they
can
do
better,
we
don't
care.
texas
says
that.
our
statutes
of
limitations
are
jus
procedural.
then
you
would
acknowledge
that
neither
the
full
faith
or
credit
clause
nor
the
due
process
clause
would
require
the
forum
to
apply
them,
or
would
you
still
say
the
forum
had
to
apply
them?
justice
scalia
it
is
in
the
statute.
they
have
actually--
justice
scalia
--where
i
don't
follow
you,
mr.
sawatzky,
is,
i
don't
see
how
we
can
tell
a
state
that
its
statute
of
limitations
must
be
substantive,
and
once
you
accept
that
then
your
scheme
doesn't
give
us
any
more
certainty
that
the
existing
scheme.
you
would
still
have
to
examine
each
state's
statute
of
limitations
to
decide
whether
they
really
intend
it
to
be
substantive
or
not.
all
you
are
doing
is
shifting
the
presumption,
i
suppose.
justice
scalia
that's
a
good
idea.
justice
scalia
well,
you
had
here
a
texas
case
that
had
used
the
lower
interest
figure,
didn't
you?
justice
scalia
and
in
the
face
of
that
the
kansas
court
said,
no,
the
next
time
around
they
are
going
to
use
a
higher
one.
justice
scalia
those
are
personal
injury
cases
you
are
referring
to.
justice
scalia
--you
think
there
is
some
possibility
that
they
got
it
entirely
right?
justice
scalia
in
spite
of
a
statute.
justice
scalia
--
in
which
these
leases
existed
had
to
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
those
states
and
not
the
law
of
kansas.
thereafter,
the
kansas
supreme
court
held,
number
one,
that
kansas
law
govern
the
statute
of
limitations
since
that
issue
was
procedural,
and
two,
that
on
the
substance
of
issues
concerning
what
the
rate
of
interest
should
be,
the
laws
of
the
other
states
produce
the
same
result
that
kansas
law
would
produce
anyway.
petitioner
contends
that
both
of
those
holdings
violates
--
violate
the
full
faith
and
credit
and
due
process
clause.
as
it's
more
fully
explained
in
the
opinion
we
announced
today,
we
reject
petitioner's
contentions
and
therefore
affirm.
concerning
the
use
of
kansas
law
to
govern
the
statute
of
limitations,
we
hold
that
the
history
and
the
original
understanding
of
the
clauses
support
the
position
taken
previously
by
this
court
that
the
use
of
the
forum
statute
of
limitations
for
choice
of
law
purposes
is
permissible.
such
use
of
the
four
limitations
period
continues
to
be
permissible
since
that
traditional
practice
remains
the
general
practice
in
state
courts.
concerning
the
kansas
supreme
court's
interpretations
of
texas,
oklahoma,
and
louisiana
law,
we
hold
that
those
constructions
do
not
violate
the
constitutional
requirement
that
they
not
contradict
clearly
established
law
in
the
other
state
that
has
been
brought
to
the
rendering
court's
attention.
