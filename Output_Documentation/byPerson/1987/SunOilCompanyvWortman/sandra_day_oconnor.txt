justice
o'connor
mr.
sawatzky,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
it
seemed
to
me
that
at
least
in
your
brief
you
didn't
argue
that
texas,
louisiana,
and
oklahoma
courts
consider
their
shorter
statutes
of
limitations
as
substantive.
justice
o'connor
do
they...
have
you
cited
any
authority
that
would
indicate
to
us
that
those
states
regard
their
statutes
of
limitations
as
substantive
rather
than
procedural?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
can
imagine
certainly
that
a
particular
state
could
make
a
determination
for
itself
that
it
wanted
to
treat
a
particular
statute
of
limitations
as
substantive,
but
absent
that,
i
wonder
whether
we
should
assume
that
it
is.
justice
o'connor
well,
that
certainly
wasn't
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
wells
case,
was
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
justice
jackson
certainly
put
forward
an
argument
in
his
opinion
in
that
case.
justice
o'connor
but
it
didn't
carry
the
day,
did
it?
justice
o'connor
how
is
the
due
process
argument
different
from
the
full
faith
and
credit
argument?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
penny,
with
all
respect,
i
didn't
think
that
was
why
we
took
the
case.
we
concede
what
the
merits
are.
i
thought
we
were
here
to
decide
whether
the
kansas
court
should...
what
statute
of
limitations
should
be
applied
and
what
interest
rate
should
be
applied
to
those
claims
arising
in
other
states.
justice
o'connor
so
do
you
plan
to
talk
about
those?
justice
o'connor
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
what
if
texas,
for
example,
passed
a
law
that
made
it
crystal
clear
it
considered
its
shorter
statute
of
limitations
to
be
substantive?
do
you
think
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
might
require
kansas
to
apply
that
texas
law?
