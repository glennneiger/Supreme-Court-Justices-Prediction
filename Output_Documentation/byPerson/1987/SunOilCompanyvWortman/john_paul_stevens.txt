justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt--
justice
stevens
--just
to
go
back
to
professor
loeffler's
article?
was
he
recommending
a
conflicts
of
law
rule
or
a
constitutional
law
rule?
justice
stevens
i
have
a
vague
recollection
that
he
is
very
reluctant
to
constitutionalize
the
law
of
conflicts
of
laws.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
if
that
statute
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
kansas
supreme
court
by
either
party
to
the
litigation?
justice
stevens
you
at
least
had
a
theory
that
the
federal
rule
applied.
justice
stevens
and
they
opposed
it.
what
did
they
claim?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
about
the
oklahoma
statute?
i
understand...
neither
party
cited
it,
and
i
understand
your
theory
was
that
the
federal
rule
applied.
were
you
aware
of
the
statute
at
the
time
the
case
was
argued
in
kansas?
justice
stevens
i
see,
and
you
don't
know
whether
your
opponent
was
or
not?
