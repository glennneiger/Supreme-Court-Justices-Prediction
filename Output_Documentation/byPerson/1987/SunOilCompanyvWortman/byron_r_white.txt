justice
white
do
you
think
we
have
to
overrule
a
whole
string
of
cases
to
hold
for
you
on
this?
justice
white
just
ignore
them,
or
what?
justice
white
well,
don't
you
have
a
court
of
appeals
case
on
your
side?
justice
white
the
third
circuit?
justice
white
what
did
they
say?
justice
white
they
must
have
felt
that
there
weren't
any
cases
and
this
court
finding
them
that
would
hold
otherwise.
justice
white
do
you
think
in
some
of
the
old
cases
did
that
very
situation
obtain?
i
mean,
how
could
hustler
have
reserved
that
question
if
there
were
a
lot
of
cases
historically
that
had
addressed
that
very
situation?
justice
white
had
they?
had
they
or
not?
justice
white
so
it's
the
constitutional
issue
that
hustler
reserved,
you
think?
justice
white
and
that...
taking
it
both
ways,
whether
the
forum
state
statute
is
longer
or
shorter.
justice
white
is
there
an
interest
argument
here,
what
rate
of
interest?
justice
white
are
you
going
to
leave
that
to
your
brief?
justice
white
and
the
rate?
justice
white
and
they
thought
the
texas
courts
would
apply
that?
justice
white
and
others.
justice
white
and
others,
yes.
justice
white
that
is
a
plaintiff's
state.
justice
white
that's
a
plaintiff's
state.
justice
white
a
little
bit
off
the
mark?
justice
white
so
the
kansas
court
was
a
little
bit
wrong.
should
we
say,
well,
it
is
only
a
little
bit
so
we
affirm?
or
do
they
have
to
do
it
over
again?
justice
white
or
would
be?
justice
white
at
the
time
of
this
judgment
was
the
louisiana
law
the
way
you
say
it
is
now?
justice
white
well,
they
just
didn't
look
at
the
louisiana
code
then.
justice
white
how
about
texas?
justice
white
it
came
later.
justice
white
oklahoma?
justice
white
and
the
kansas
court
just
borrowed
the
federal
rules,
the
federal
rate?
justice
white
saying
that
these
other
states
would
do
the
same
thing.
justice
white
is
it
clear
that
they
would
not
do
that?
i
mean,
is
it
clear
from
the
texas
case
law
that
given
a
case
that
specifically
involved
this
kind
of
a
situation
they
wouldn't
use
the
federal
agency's
rule
rather
than--
justice
white
in
oklahoma
it
says,
here's
the
interest
rate
on
overdue
royalty.
we
nevertheless
will
apply
the
federal
rate.
justice
white
have
you
got
a
citation
for
the
oklahoma
statute
that
you
didn't
have
in
your
brief?
justice
white
but
isn't
there
an
issue
in
here
of
not
only
postjudgment
but
prejudgment
interest?
justice
white
i
thought
there
was
some
argument
that
these
other
states
wouldn't
give
prejudgment
interest
at
all.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--that
was
a
common
law
rule,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
what
about
the
louisiana
statute?
justice
white
how
about
in
this
case?
justice
white
well,
how
come
they
said
louisiana
would
apply
the
federal
rule?
