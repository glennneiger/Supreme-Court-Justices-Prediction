mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
respondents
here
is
simply
that
barr
and
its
progeny
set
out
applicable
rules,
we
feel,
to
apply
immunity
involving
common
law
or
state
tort
actions.
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
an
activity
that
is
within
the
outer
perimeters
of
a
job
of
a
government
employee,
and
an
activity
that
is
discretionary
within
that
outer
perimeter.
a
question
was
put
earlier
as
to
whether
or
not
that
outer
perimeter
in
and
of
itself
would
establish
liability
and
were
there
any
cases
on
that.
doe
v.
mcmillan
speaks
directly
to
that
point.
in
that
case,
the
printer
of
documents
was
sued.
the
court
held
without
a
doubt
his
activities
were
within
the
outer
perimeters
but
that
his
job
and
doing
what
he
was
doing
on
this
occasion
was
not
discretionary.
since
it
was
not
discretionary,
he
did
not
enjoy
the
barr
immunity.
there
were
other
questions
involved
which
are
constitutional
in
nature,
but
it
was
directed
directly
to
the
barr
case.
there
is
a
need
to
allow
causes
of
action
like
this.
there
is
a
need
in
alabama
and
throughout
the
states.
in
this
particular
instance...
there's
22
states,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
do
allow
some
type
of
a
co-employee
case.
in
this
particular
case,
the
plaintiff,
erwin,
did
receive
an
injury
as
a
consequence
of
being
exposed
to
soda
ash.
he
did
receive
worker's
compensation
under
federal
workers
compensation.
however,
that
compensation
statute
is
limited
in
its
application.
he
received
an
injury
to
his
vocal
cords.
he
cannot
talk.
as
a
consequence
of
not
being
a
scheduled
member,
this
man
received
an
injury
for
which
there
was
no
redress
except
in
a
direction
action
against
a
coemployee
in
this
case.
other
fact
situations
are
not
like
this
one.
there
may
be
cases
where
the
federal
workers
compensation
does
provide
sufficient
indemnity
so
as
to
preclude
suit,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
a
petition
for
cert.
before
this
court
on
that
very
point.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
it
should
not
unless
there's
a
specific
statute
addressing
that
simply
because
of
the
due
process
issues.
in
the
states
where
there
have
been
co-employee
and
workmen's
compensation
both
recoverable,
and
it
would
be
analogous
to
the
federal
circumstance,
suits
were
allowed
unless
there
was
a
constitutional
amendment
immunizing
that
co-employee
in
exchange
for
receipt
of
the
benefits.
it's
a
trade
off
also.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
no,
sir.
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that.
i'm
saying
that
there
would
be
some
argument
that
there
was
a
justification
for
extending
immunity
in
those
circumstances,
though
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
valid
argument.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
no,
sir.
i
think
it
would
be
a
legislative
determination.
primary
example
of
that
is
the
bivens
circumstance
where
the
federal
torts
claims
act
did
not
provide
for
actions
of
malice
such
as
in
the
bivens
case.
after
bivens,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
expanded
to
include
actions
such
as
were
taken
up
in
that
particular
instance.
and
we
submit
that
that
would
be
the
proper
manner
and
way
in
which
to
present
and
face
this
particular
issue.
what
is
discretion?
discretion
i
don't
believe
means
the
right
to
make
a
decision
one
way
or
another
necessarily.
discretion
is
whether
or
not
the
act
was
a
judgment
or
a
decision
which
it
is
necessary
that
the
government
official
be
able
to
make
without
fear
of
suit,
that
is,
something
that
effects
governing,
something
that
effects
the
extension
of
governing,
of
policy
making,
not
policy
application.
the
analogy
that
applies
in
this
instance
is
the
ftca.
clearly
state
law
applies
in
an
instance
that
happens
within
a
state
under
the
ftca.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
no,
sir.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
there
could
be
and
these
cases
hold
generally
that
you
have
to
look
at
each
particular
instance,
each
particular
function,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
policy
involved,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
action,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
duty,
the
functional
analysis
test.
so
certainly
in
certain
instances
you
can
have
an
aggressive
policy
implementor
but
that
doesn't
in
all
instances
mean
that
person
is
immune
to
suit
under
common
law
causes
of
action.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
no,
ma'am.
only
in
the
event
that
that
policy
effected
governing,
per
se.
there
is
no
uniqueness--
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
--that's
right,
yes,
ma'am,
i
think
so.
clearly,
the
policies
that
affect
governance...
governing--
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
--no,
sir,
not
really.
i
don't
think
i
want
to
say
that,
for
this
reason.
i
don't
believe--
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
--the
case
law
does
not
say
that.
i
think
that
you're
going
to
have
to
look
at
the
position,
the
level,
the
type
of
activity
of
the
defendant,
and
then
decide
on
a
case-by-case
basis
based
on
the
law
as
it
is
now
as
to
whether
or
not
the
activities
involved,
number
one,
were
within
the
outer
perimeters,
and
number
two,
involved
discretion.
and
if
that
discretion
is
such
that
it
affects
governing,
then
there
is
absolute
immunity.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
yes,
sir.
in
my
judgment,
you
need
to
use
the
same
analysis
as
was
used
in
the
davis
case.
that
is,
you
looked
at
the
state
activities.
they
said,
in
davis,
that
since
the
state
officials
are
subject
to
1983,
we're
going
to
make
the
federal
officials
subject
to
1983,
looking
at
their
activities.
i
think
you
could
look
the
same
way
at
the
general
motors
question,
you
can
look
at
the
activities
that
are
analogous
to
the
activities
involved,
and
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
that
is
governing
or
simply
ministerially
carrying
out
the
activities
at
the
time.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
i
think
so.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
sir?
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
proprietary
has
so
many
meanings
just
as
discretionary
has.
i
wish
that
we
could
lay
down
a
set
of
rules
that
we
could
punch
a
bunch
of
holes
and
put
pegs
in
it.
,--
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
--sir?
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
no,
sir.
i
think
that
congress
should
do
it,
but
i
think
this
court
has
to
explain
what
was
meant
in
barr
and
subsequently
in
doe
and
the
extent
that
discretion
is
involved
in
order
to
obtain
immunity.
i
think
you're
going
to
have
to
do
that.
i
think
i
know
what
it
says,
but
the
other
courts
do
not
know.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
no,
sir.
but
if
you
do
not
lay
out
those
guidelines,
there's
going
to
be
the
same
problem
that
there
is
now
within
the
circuit.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
that's
exactly
right,
sir.
except
for
the
fact
that
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
there
are
now
pending
four
cases,
one
of
which
is
mine,
that
are
on
these
very
issues.
[laughter]
that
are
on
these
very
issues,
so
i
may
be
back
up
here
again
in
not
too
long.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
well,--
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
--i
would
hope
so.
i
think
it
may
be
a
case
by
case
analysis,
if
you
use
the
constitutional
tort
analysis,
it's
a
case
by
case
analysis.
if
you
look
at
what
barr
said,
it
said,
we
need
to
look
at
the
functional
approach,
we
need
to
look
at
each
particular
case.
and
that's
what
you're
going
to
have
to
do.
the
question
is,
i
think
you
could
do
it
by
defining
what
"discretion"
means,
if
that
is
the
word.
if
you
mean
discretion
in
all
policy
making,
that's
one
thing.
if
you
mean
carrying
out
the
day
to
day
operations,
that's
another
thing.
that's
not
policy
making
in
my
judgment.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
i
think
that
that
clearly
is
what
this
court
has
held.
i
think
that
it
has
held
that
high
level
people
that
are
involved
in
policy
making
should
not
have
that
fear,
but
there
should
be
no
distinction
between
a
civilian
and
a
government
employee
if
that
fear
would
not
affect
the
effective
carrying
on
of
government.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
yes,
sir,
they
did
in
that
instance
and
that
was
an
ftca
case.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
yes,
sir.
i
think
so.
because
there
is
more
to
it
merely
than
the
stacking.
there
is
a
question
here
of
failure
to
warn,
negligent
failure
to
warn
in
and
of
itself.
for
instance,--
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
--yes,
sir,
could
be,
could
be.
for
example--
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
--yes,
sir.
i
think
that
dalehite
says
clearly
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
policy
making
aspect
and
the
carrying
out
of
that
policy.
i
believe
the
word
that's
referred
to
is,
execution
of
the
plan
adopted.
that's
what
dalehite
said.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
it's
the
execution
of
that
plan,
how
it's
carried
out,
not
necessarily
only
stacking
it
up,
but
also
what
information
do
you
impart
relative
to
the
stacking
up
of
it.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
no,
sir,
it
was
governmental
when
they
made
the
decision
to
stack
it
up.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
that
was
what
was
decided.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
i
think
that's
what
was
decided
in
the
case.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
well,
there's
also
other
instances,
i
believe,
but
qualified
immunity,
as
i
understand
it,
is
very
narrow.
it's
much
more
narrow
than
the
state
cause
of
action
immunity.
it
says,
as
i
understand
it,
that
if
there
is
a
rule
that
is
reasonably
understood
and
that
rule
or
law
is
violated
reasonably
there
is
still
immunity
or
can
be
immunity,
but
there's
a
burden
to
show
that
it
was
reasonable
to
have
violated
it.
that
is
somewhat
different
than
the
common
law
cause
of
action,
in
my
judgment.
the
objective
reasonableness
in
light
of
existing
law
is
where
the
qualified
immunity
attaches.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
it
could
qualify
if
you
applied
the
quote
unquote
existing
law
to
be
the
state
law
that
applies.
however,
there
is
an
argument
related
to
the
qualified
immunity
that
says
that
federal
law
of
course
always
supercedes
state
law.
therefore,
we
won't
have
the
opportunity
to
look
at
the
state
law.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
alabama
has
a
workmen's
compensation
law
just
like
most
other
states,
provides
compensation
if
you're
hurt
on
the
job.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
due
care,
pure
due
care.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
it
would
be
in
that
instance.
and
if
you
extended
it
to
warnings,
failure
to
warn,
it
may
be
included
within
that,
but
due
care
is
the
standard,
purely
due
care.
you
also
have
to
look
of
course
in
alabama
as
to
whether
or
not...
and
i
think
other
states...
there
was
a
duty
associated
with
it.
that
never
came
up,
it
was
never
reached
in
this
issue.
but
in
many
of
the
cases
that
are
co-employee-type
cases,
duty
is
the
most
important
aspect
of
it.
there
are
other
cases,
though,
that
are
not
co-employee
that
apply
this
immunity
also,
or
that
are
attempting
to
apply
this
immunity.
there
are
other
instances
where
suits
are
directed
against
individuals
where
the
ftca
does
not
apply.
where
there's
no
government
compensation
available.
the
johns
case
that's
cited
in
these
briefs
and
also
is
on
hold
is
such
a
case.
that's
where
a
man
was
killed
on
a
government
reservation.
you
cannot
sue
tva
who
owned
the
reservation
for
wrongful
death
in
alabama.
therefore,
the
only
opportunity
that
man
had
was
to
sue
the
co-employees.
therefore,
they
say,
though
tva
would
not
be
immune
to
death
in
another
state,
these
individuals
are
immune.
so
in
that
instance,
the
man
has
absolutely
no
redress.
the
question
again
is
discretionary
function.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
yes,
sir,
i
am.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
as
i
understand
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
do,
yes,
sir.
as
it
applies
to
the
incidents
in
this
case,
yes,
sir,
i
do.
i
think
ftca
and
i
said
in
my
brief
is
much
broader,
simply
because
it
covers
a
lot
of
instances
where
this
court
has
specifically
said
there
is
absolute
immunity,
but
nevertheless,
the
rationale
of
ftca,
i
think,
applies.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
all
with
the
exception
of
one,
and
that
is
one
that
i
have.
the
rest
of
them
are
co-employee
suits.
they
are
all
negligence
cases.
none
of
them
involve
the
liable
cases.
mr.
m.
clay
alspaugh
except
in
instances
where
the
ftca
does
not
apply.
there
are
certain
agencies
where
it
doesn't
apply.
tva's
one
of
them.
but
there
are
certain
agencies
where
it
does
not
apply.
i
do
not
know
what
will
be
addressed
further
in
my
response.
i
don't
guess
it'll
be
anything
we
haven't
talked
about,
but
nevertheless,
there
was
raised
in
brief
some
issues
dealing
with
the
likelihood
that
the
common
law
cause
of
action
is
analogous
to
the
constitutional
tort
cause
of
action.
i
do
not
think
it
is,
notwithstanding
what
the
d.c.
court
said.
it
simply
said
that
if
you
have
a
federal
law
that
supercedes
a
state
law,
we
will
apply
it
and
they
can
work
hand
in
hand.
in
closing,
i
think
that
the
law
is
clear
that
there
are
two
prongs
in
every
case
like
this
against
a
co-employee
or
a
government
employee
that
have
to
be
addressed,
and
that
the
discretion
only
provides
immunity
in
the
event
it
does
affect
government
itself
and
not
the
day
to
day
operations
of
government.
thank
you.
