mr.
ayer,
in
any
event,
do
you
extend
this
immunity
to
every
federal
employee?
i
think
you
said
something
earlier,
he
has
to
have
some
discretion
in
the
doing
of
his
job.
do
you
draw
a
line
at
policy
makers?
justice
jr.
their
rule
is
a
limiting
rule?
justice
jr.
they
went
to
high
policy
makers
did
they?
justice
jr.
policy
and
planning
makers.
you
would
go
further
and
say
any
one
who
has
discretion
on
how
to
do
his
job?
justice
jr.
has
that
ever
been
held?
justice
jr.
of
what?
justice
jr.
i
don't
think
i
thought
so
in
barr,
did
i?
justice
jr.
no.
justice
jr.
and
i
suppose
being
afraid
to
do
some
kinds
of
duties
is
just
more
significant
than
being
afraid
to
do
other
kinds
of
duties?
