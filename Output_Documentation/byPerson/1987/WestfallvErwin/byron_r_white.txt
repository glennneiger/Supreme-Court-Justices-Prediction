justice
white
federal
instrumentalities
from
state
taxes,
what's
the
basis
of
that
immunity?
justice
white
well,
what
if
the
painter
drops
the
can
of
paint
on
somebody
because
he
doesn't
like
them
and
he
just
does
it,
and
it's
intentional.
justice
white
yes,
intentional.
justice
white
absolute
immunity?
justice
white
well,
after
all,
it
was
pretty
intentional
in
barr.
justice
white
so
your
submission
is
a
case
by
case
analysis?
justice
white
in
every
single
case
you
go
through
this
routine
of
inquiry
which
you
think
doe
against
mcmillan
indicated,
and
so
can
we
set
down
some
rules
here
that
would
govern
your
other
case?
justice
white
you
would
hope
so,
i
suppose?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
that
a
lot
of
the
reason
for
any
immunity
at
all
is
that
government
employees
shouldn't
be
afraid
to
do
their
duty.
justice
white
if
you
are
right
about
absolute
immunity,
you
nevertheless
would
say
that
there's
a
qualified
immunity,
wouldn't
you?
justice
white
and
except
for
what,
except
for
ministerial
acts?
you
get
no
qualified
immunity
for
those,
do
you?
justice
white
and
i
suppose
you
say
just
by
definition,
a
negligent
act
couldn't
qualify?
justice
white
but
your
principal
argument
here
as
you
described
at
the
outset
is
that
you
want
immunity
where
there
is
some
measure
of
discretion.
that
isn't
a
very
firm
rule,
either.
justice
white
so
if
the
law
says,
please
pile
this
soda
ash
in
paper
sacks
ten
sacks
high,
that
wouldn't
be
detailed
enough.
you
have
to
go
on.
justice
white
so
you're
about
as
close
to
your
per
se
rule
as
you
can
get.
justice
white
of
any
government
employee
acting
within
the
perimeter
of
his
duties?
