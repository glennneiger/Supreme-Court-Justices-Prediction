justice
o'connor
mr.
ayer,
what's
the
source
of
that
immunity
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
yes.
do
you
detect
any
source
for
finding
that
immunity?
justice
o'connor
so
you
are
proposing
a
sort
of
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis
in
effect?
justice
o'connor
our
cases
have
never
discussed
the
theory,
have
they?
in
fact,
the
barr
case
arose
out
of
what
was
it,
a
liable?
justice
o'connor
action
and
was
discussed
in
terms
of
privilege,
not
immunity
at
all.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
ayer,
if
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
to
determine
what
congress
would
do
if
it
had
thought
about
it,
should
we
analogize
then
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
our
guidance
in
determining
discretionary
acts
for
which
there
might
be
immunity?
justice
o'connor
well,
nonetheless,
that's
a
line
congress
has
drawn,
and
wouldn't
most
tort
claimants
be
suing
both
the
employee
and
the
federal
government
if
they
had
a
state
tort
action,
so
you
would
be
determining
that
question
anyway,
wouldn't
we?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
alspaugh,
if
the
supervisors
in
this
case
had
made
an
explicit
policy
that
they
were
going
to
store
the
bags
in
the
manner
in
which
they
stored
the
bags
here,
then
under
your
theory,
no
suit
could
be
brought.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
we're
not
talking
about
just
making
policy,
we're
talking
about
certain
kinds
of
policies,
then--
