justice
scalia
this
is
not
a
constitutional
principle,
though,
right.
i
mean,
congress
could
i
presume
pass
a
statute
saying
there
is
no
immunity
whatever
for
federal?
justice
scalia
so
it's
sort
of
like
a
negative
commerce
clause
kind
of?
justice
scalia
you're
confusing
me
when
you
begin
to
talk
about
state
rules
as
opposed
to
negligence
liability.
is
your
contention
that
a
federal
worker
by
reason
of
his
status
as
a
federal
worker
is
not
subject
to
a
state
rule
such
as
a
rule,
for
example,
that
you
will
not
use
lead-based
paints
on
indoor
rooms?
justice
scalia
is
your
contention
that
simply
because
he
has
a
discretion
in
what
paint
to
use,
which
he
surely
does,
that
he
can
use
a
lead-based
paint,
when
you
have
a
state
statute
that
says
they
won't
be
used?
justice
scalia
no,
no.
i'm
not
talking
about
personal
liability.
justice
scalia
does
the
state
law
apply
to
him?
justice
scalia
that's
my
feel,
too.
justice
scalia
but
you
say
no
personal
liability
for
his
doing
it?
justice
scalia
i
understand
that.
we
only
want
fearless
policy
makers,
we
do
not
want
fearless
implementors
of
policy,
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
we
want
to
be
sure
we
have
really
terrific
impartial
federal
policies
but
we
don't
really
care
how
they're
implemented,
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
--are
you
proposing
the
kind
of
distinction
that
used
to
exist
for
purposes
of
municipal
immunity
from
suit?
that
is
whether,
you
remember
in
the
old
days,
whether
the
municipality
was
acting
in
a
governmental
capacity
or
in
a
proprietary
capacity?
is
that
what
you're
bringing
in
here?
justice
scalia
i
hope
not
because
that
is
a
very
confusing
doctrine.
what
are
you
proposing,
then?
justice
scalia
well,
it's
easy
to
say,
but
what
do
you
mean
by,
affects
governing?
everything,
any
discretion
by
a
government
official
affects
governing
in
the
broad
sense,
right?
you
mean
it
in
a
more
narrow
sense
than
that?
justice
scalia
so
it
has
to
be
the
type
of
activity
that
only
government
can
do?
justice
scalia
that's
the
old
proprietary
governmental
distinction.
why
are
you
so
afraid
to
endorse
the
proprietary
governmental
distinction?
justice
scalia
that's
different
from
what
you
are
arguing
in
your
brief,
then.
you
know,
the
dalehite
test
is
not
a
policy
level
discretion
test.
you're
saying
only
policy
officials
can
benefit
from
the
discretionary
function
exemption
you
would
allow
in
these
private
suits.
justice
scalia
but
that
includes
a
plan
for
the
stacking
of
bags
of
fertilizer.
yes.
which
general
motors
can
do,
right?
that's
not
a
distinctively
governmental
kind
of
thing?
justice
scalia
then
it
becomes
governmental?
justice
scalia
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
are
willing
to
accept
for
the
application
to
these
cases
the
same
discretionary
function
test
that's
used
in
the
ftca
cases?
justice
scalia
you're
willing
to
do
that?
justice
scalia
you
think
it's
the
same
line?
justice
scalia
and
you're
sure
that
that
would
give
you
a
victory
here?
