justice
blackmun
mr.
ayer,
focusing
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
is
the
discretion
exercised,
and
what
is
it?
the
way
the
soda
ash
was
piled?
justice
blackmun
my
next
question
is,
aren't
they
going
to
do
exactly
the
same
thing
whether
we
have
a
rule
of
immunity
or
not?
justice
blackmun
discretion
here
in
the
way
the
bags
of
soda
ash
were
piled?
justice
blackmun
my
only
point
is
that
the
fact
of
discretion
as
you
have
defined
it
is
certainly
going
to
be
carried
out
whether
there
is
a
rule
of
immunity
or
not,
and
therefore
one
of
the
reasons
for
barr
v.
matteo
is
inapplicable
to
the
fact
situation
here.
