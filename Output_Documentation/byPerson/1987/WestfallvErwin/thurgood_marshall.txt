isn't
that
what
judge
learned
hand
said?
didn't
he
say
where
it's
done
deliberately,
he's
still
protected?
justice
marshall
that's
what
he
said.
justice
marshall
how
much
lower
is
it
than
somebody
stacking
sacks?
justice
marshall
how
much
lower
do
you
get?
justice
marshall
but
i
mean,
is
there
anything
lower
than
that?
justice
marshall
could
there
be
regulations
that
what
is
lower
than
that,
or
could
you
answer
it?
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
that's
lower
than
handling
sacks
of
garbage?
justice

this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
respondent
brought
a
state
law
tort
suit
against
petitioners
who
are
federal
employees,
claiming
that
they
suffered
injuries
as
a
result
of
petitioners'
negligence
in
performing
certain
official
acts.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
petitioners
on
the
ground
that
federal
employees
are
absolutely
immune
from
state
law
tort
suits
for
a
conduct
within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
and
here
we
conclude
that
federal
officials
enjoy
absolute
immunity
from
state
law
tort
suits
only
if
the
challenge
conduct
is
discretionary
in
nature
as
well
as
being
within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
we
also
reject
petitioners'
contention
that
an
act
is
discretionary
whenever
the
precise
conduct
of
the
federal
employee
is
not
prescribed
by
law.
the
district
court
erred
in
granting
summary
judgment
because
there
is
a
genuine
issue
of
fact
that
is
rather
petitioner
exercised
sufficient
discretion
in
connection
with
the
alleged
tort
to
be
absolutely
immune
from
suit.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
