justice
stevens
may
i,
before
you
leave
the
other?
is
it
therefore
true
that
the
federal
employee
compensation
act
omits
a
provision
that's
found
in
many
other
compensation
statutes,
and
maybe
that
should
be
the
remedy?
justice
stevens
and
most
other
compensation
schemes
do
have
such
an
express
provision,
or
has
it
been
read
into
some
of
those
statutes?
what
i'm
really
probing
for,
is
it
possible
that
one
could
give
you
the
relief
you
seek
by
saying
that's
how
that
statute
should
have
been
interpreted
if
that's
really
what
the
problem
is?
justice
stevens
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
if
congress
promptly
reacted
to
the
medical
malpractice
situation
the
way
they
did
and
also
reacted
to
the
drivers'
liability
the
way
they
did,
seeing
a
problem
there,
that
they
would
do
precisely
the
same
thing
here,
if
there's
such
a
simple
solution?
who
should
do
the
lawmaking
here
at
the
bottom
of
this
case
that
we're
all
troubled
by?
justice
stevens
and
apparently,
when
they
did
the
lawmaking,
the
found
a
basis
for
liability
against
doctors
and
a
basis
for
liability
who
would...
i
mean,
congress
would
have
thought
there
would
have
been
liability
against
drivers,
why
not
against
people
who
store
whatever
this
product
was
in
a
negligent
manner?
justice
stevens
well,
supposing
a
maintenance
worker
on
this
building,
why
should
he
be
under
different
rules
than
maintenance
workers
on
a
district
building?
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
not
thinking
of
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
defendant,
but
the
plaintiff.
why
should
it
make
a
difference
whether
a
bucket
of
paint
is
dropped
by
a
worker
on
a
public
building
or
a
private
building?
anybody
should
be
careful
with
buckets
of
paint.
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
that's
different
than
driving
a
car.
you
say
the
federal
employees
have
to
obey
the
traffic
rules.
why
don't
they
have
to
obey
other
rules
that
govern
normal
conduct
that
imposes
risks?
justice
stevens
you
can't
do
it
with
careless
drivers,
either.
justice
stevens
negligent
driving,
there's
a
difference
between
negligent
driving
and
negligent
workmanship?
justice
stevens
but
counsel,
why
is
that
any
different
from
an
employee
working
for
general
motors,
for
example.
justice
stevens
you
certainly
can't
rule
out
the
possibility
the
federal
government
would
see
the
need
for
indemnification
or
insurance.
justice
stevens
well,
general
motors
doesn't,
either.
but
it's
good
business
to
protect
morale
and
all
the
rest.
and
i
would
suppose
the
same,
you
know--
justice
stevens
--when
they're
engaged
in
activities
like
painting
buildings,
why
not?
justice
stevens
why
are
you
so
afraid
to
endorse
the
proprietary
governmental
distinction?
a
lot
of
people
thought
it
made
sense
for
a
long
time.
justice
stevens
you
agree
with
the
government
that
this
is
a
job
that
we
should
be
doing?
justice
stevens
this
is
a
law
making
job
that
the
court
should
do
rather
than
congress,
you
agree
with
that?
justice
stevens
well,
do
we
really
have
to
do
anything
more
than
to
say
whether
or
not
piling
these
bags
or
whatever
they
were
amounts
to
discretion
or
doesn't?
do
we
have
to
decide
every
possible
case?
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
care
about
that
if
you
win
this
case,
do
you?
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
this,
if
the
discretion
line
is
the
same
under
the
tort
claims
and
under
your
understanding
of
the
immunity
doctrine,
are
all
these
other
cases
that
are
pending,
at
least
in
your
circuit,
suits
by
co-employees?
justice
stevens
because
it
seems
to
me
if
they're
not
co-employee
suits,
that
then
there
would
always
be
a
suit
against
the
government
in
the
case
where
the
employee
is
immune.
