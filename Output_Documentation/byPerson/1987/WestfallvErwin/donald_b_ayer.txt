mr.
donald
b.
ayer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
denying
immunity
to
three
supervisors
at
a
military
supply
depot
in
a
negligence
action
against
them
for
employment-related
injuries
suffered
to
an
employee
at
the
depot.
there
is
substantial
agreement,
as
indicated
in
the
briefs,
among
the
parties
concerning
a
number
of
points.
first
the
parties
agree
that
there
is
a
thing
called
absolute
immunity
that
exists
under
the
federal
common
law
and
does
protect
a
significant
category
of
federal
activities,
that
is,
the
activities
of
federal
employees
against
personal
liability
of
those
employees
from
state
tort
law
actions.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
apart
from
this
court's
cases,
you
mean,
going
back?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
the
source,
i
think,
is
the
priority
of
protecting
the
ability
of
the
federal
government
to
function
and
perform
the
duties
and
tasks
that
it
has
ultimately
under
the
constitution.
i
think
one
could
ask
the
question,
is
it
a
matter
of
supremacy
and
are
we
invoking
the
supremacy
clause.
and
i
would
say
i
guess
my
answer
to
that
would
be,
sort
of.
and
i'll
explain
that
by
saying
that
technically
in
this
case
we
are
talking
about
an
application
of
state
law
that
has
been
made
applicable
in
the
context
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
federal
enclaves
as
a
matter
of
congressional
action,
a
blanket
enactment
of
state
law.
but
the
concern
remains
very
real.
so
that
the
"sort
of"
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
there
is
not
a
technical
conflict
that
does
not
involve
an
act
of
congress
triggering
the
application
of
state
law.
there
is
nonetheless
the
tension
between
the
application
of
evolving
state
tort
law
concepts
and
the
priority
of
the
federal
government
being
able
to
perform
its
functions
through
its
employees.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that
is
certainly
true,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
is
maybe
a
sort
of
an
assumption
or
a
presumption
that
it
is
intended
that
the
federal
government
be
able,
intended
in
the
constitution,
absent
some
action
by
congress
indicating
otherwise,
that
it
be
able
to
go
forward
with
its
activities
as
authorized
by
congress,
and
the
disruption
that
would
result
by
the
regular
interaction
of
state
law
principles
interfering
with
the
performance
of
those
functions
i
think
is
what
it's
designed
to
protect.
congress
could
of
course
say
we
do
not
intend
to
have
these
federal
authorizations
override
state
law.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
it
was
clearly
discussed
by
reference
to
the
decision
in
gregoire
v.
biddle
and
the
need
to
protect
the
federal
functioning.
it
was
discussed
in
language,
i
think,
that
went
well
beyond
the
implications
of
the
defamation
character
of
the
action
that
was
involved
there.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it
may
well
be
somewhat
analogous
to
this
situation.
it's
analogous
in
the
sense,
as
justice
scalia
has
pointed
out,
that
congress
could
override
it
if
it
chose
to.
if
it
chose
to
define
federal
priorities
in
a
way
that
allowed
the
state
law
to
override,
it
certainly
could
do
so.
but
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
here
where
there
has
been
no
such
overriding,
and
we're
trying
to
focus
on
what
the
proper
rule
ought
to
be
in
the
situation
where
congress
presumably
intends
to
have
its
activities
carried
out
in
a
way
that
has
evolved
both
under
statutes
and
regulations.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
will
agree
with
that
as
well,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
would
prefer
to
characterize
it
in
the
terms
that
the
court
has
put
it
in,
and
that
is,
in
terms
of
the
need
to
protect
the
functioning
of
the
federal
government
and
to
analyze
it
that
way.
and
we
think
that
when
analyzed
that
way,
there
are
a
number
of
policy
considerations
upon
which
the
doctrine
has
rested.
before
i
get
to
that,
i'd
like
to
indicate
precisely
what
it
is
we
are
seeking
to
argue
here
today,
and
what
we've
argued
in
our
briefs.
although
we
believe
that
federal
employees
are
properly
immune
from
state
tort
law
actions
for
all
acts
that
they
take
within
the
scope
of
their
employment,
our
principal
submission
both
in
our
briefs,
and
today
is
that
they
are
immune
for
that
conduct
within
the
outer
perimeter
at
least
when
they
are
in
the
exercise
of
some
activity
that
does
involve
a
component
of
discretion.
that
is,
in
the
words
of
this
court's
decision
in
davis
v.
scherer,
they
exercise
discretion
whenever
the
law
"fails
to
specify
the
precise
action
that
the
official
must
take
in
each
instance.
"
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
not,
justice
o'connor.
and
there's
a
couple
of
reasons
for
that.
one
is
that,
maybe
the
most
practical,
although
i
think
not
the
most
significant
one,
is
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
the
discretionary
function
exception
of
that
statute
really
doesn't
provide
us
with
much
of
a
practical
solution
when
one
goes
to
it
and
tries
to
identify
the
precise
level
of
discretion.
this
court's
decisions
in
varig
do
indeed
suggest
that
a
fairly
low
level
of
discretion
should
be
the
cut
off
under
the
tort
claims
act
at
least
where
you're
dealing
with
regulatory
sorts
of
activities.
but
much
beyond
that
there
is,
i
think
we
have
to
say,
some
significant
amount
of
confusion
as
to
exactly
where
the
line
is
drawn
in
various
situations.
but--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
that's
possible
that
they
would
be.
but
i'd
like
to
give
the
second
reason,
which
is
really
the
primary
reason
why
it's
not
an
appropriate
thing
to
do.
and
that
is
that
the
tort
claims
act
and
personal
immunity
are
really
dealing
with
very
different
things,
and
have
very
different
consequences.
the
principle
that
the
government
will
be
liable
for
its
conduct
and
essentially
that
the
burdens
of
harm
resulting
from
its
conduct
in
certain
defined
situations
defined
in
the
statute,
primarily
defined
to
include
sort
of
run
of
the
mill
negligence
in
the
performance
of
duties
is
a
principle
that
amounts
to
a
reallocation
of
that
burden.
it
is
not
an
action
that
will
necessarily
at
all
have
the
impact
of
shaping
the
conduct
of
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
has
to
engage
in
many
activities
that
will
unavoidably
have
some
harmful
affects,
and
the
conclusion
is
drawn
as
to
at
least
some
of
those
that
the
government
should
nonetheless
should
pay
for
those
things
while
going
on
doing
them
in
many
instances.
with
regard
to
personal
liability,
you're
dealing
with
a
very
different
animal
which
will
have
very
different
consequences.
imposing
the
liability
on
the
individual
will
clearly
have
a
direct
effect
in
shaping
his
or
her
conduct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
yes,
there
is.
there
are
a
couple
of
answers
to
that,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
one
is
that
when
there
is
an
award
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
you
may
not
proceed
further
or
proceed
at
all
against
an
individual.
and
our
understanding
of
that
and
our
sense
of
what
that
meant
was
that
congress
wanted
to
be
very
careful
to
create
a
clear
line
substituting
liability
once
an
action
had
been
brought.
we
do
not
read
that
at
all
as
indicating
its
understanding
that
individual
employees
would
otherwise
be
liable.
the
law
at
the
time
the
tort
claims
act
was
enacted
we
are
frank
to
say
was
less
than
completely
clear.
we
think
that
when
one
reads
spaulding
v.
vilas,
one
comes
up
with
a
principle
of
absolute
immunity
without
regard
to
malice
applicable
at
least
at
the
level
of
a
sub-cabinet
officer.
barr
v.
matteo
was
taken
by
this
court
and
was
decided
on
a
vote
of
4-1-4
with
the
one
vote
obviously
going
in
favor
of
the
immunity
but
for
reasons
that
didn't
join
in
the
majority
opinion
because
the
law
at
that
time
was
not
a
hundred
percent
clear.
in
that
state
of
unclarity
of
the
law,
it
made
perfect
sense
for
congress
to
enact
the
provision
that
it
did,
setting
a
bright
line
rule
and
a
defense
for
an
individual
should
the
government
actually
be
held
liable.
now,
there's
two
other
examples,
two
other
sets
of
statutes
that
are
also
i
think
responsive
to
your
honor's
question.
one
of
those
is
known
as
the
drivers'
act,
and
the
other
i
think
is
known
as
the
rodriguez
act.
in
any
event,
the
second
one
deals
with
the
liability
of
doctors.
taking
the
second
one
first,
in
the
early
1970s,
there
developed
some
case
law
including
the
district
of
columbia
circuit's
decision
in
henderson
v.
bluemink
finding
federal
doctors
liable
for
their
actions
simply
acting
as
doctors.
and
in
response
to
that,
in
a
rather
direct
response
applicable
to
various
categories
of
federal
doctors,
congress
enacted
legislation
saying
those
doctors
aren't
liable,
substituting
in
essence
the
united
states
as
a
party.
they
did
not
at
that
time
take
action
with
regard
to
other
categories
of
federal
employees.
we
believe
that
they
didn't
do
that
because
they
were
acting
directly
in
response
to
a
particular
problem
that
had
arisen.
the
problem
had
not
arisen
as
to
the
other
categories
of
employees
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
in
this
case,
they
cannot
sue
the
united
states
because
they
have
a
remedy
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
would
think
many
plaintiffs
do
do
that.
and
i
also
think
it
is
noteworthy
that
under
the
laws
of
many
states,
and
i
think
it's
actually
a
substantial
majority
of
states,
it
is
not
allowed
to
sue
a
co-employee,
once
you
have
recovered
a
worker's
compensation
recovery.
the
second
statute,
in
answer
to
your
question,
is
the
drivers
act,
which
in
1961--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--the
federal
employees
compensation
act
does
not
state
whether
or
not
an
employee
who
recovers
may
sue
a
co-employee.
and
we
think
that
that
silence
is
just
that,
silence.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
it
is
clearly
not,
and
this
is
something
that
we
certainly
looked
into
in
preparing
our
briefs
in
this
case.
i
think
it
is
certainly
not
that
we
can
say,
that's
the
way
that
statute
should
have
been
interpreted.
and
the
reason
it's
not
is
at
the
time
the
feca
statute
was
enacted,
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
states
was
not
as
i've
just
described
it.
i
think
it
is
now
47
states
that
have
a
provision
in
some
form
or
other
that
more
or
less
denies
a
co-employee
recovery
once
you
have
a
workers'
comp
recovery.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
there
is
a
very
good
argument
to
be
made
for
the
court's
continuing
to
do
the
lawmaking
which
rests
initially
on
the
fact
that
the
this
court
has
been
doing
the
lawmaking
in
this
area
for
a
very
long
time.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
as
to
the
doctors,
i
think
there
is
serious
doubt
as
to
whether
anybody
thought
that
that
was
an
appropriate
thing
to
have
happen.
with
regard
to
the
drivers,
i
think
indeed
you
can
make
a
reasonable
argument
that
driving,
that
the
rules
of
the
road
that
everybody
has
to
obey
including
federal
mail
delivery
people
and
other
federal
employees.
somebody's
got
to
have
a
set
of
rules
or
we're
all
going
to
be
running
into
each
other.
and
the
idea
that
a
court
would
have
concluded
that
federal
employees
must
play
by
the
same
rules
including
the
liability
rules
is
not
surprising
as
to
drivers.
i
think
it
would
be
quite
surprising
with
regard
to
virtually
every
other
category
of
federal
employee
and
federal
activity
that
you
can
imagine.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
two
answers,
i
guess.
one
is
that
i
think
one
has
to
look
very
carefully
at
the
actual
rules
that
govern
in
a
particular
situation
whether
it
be
private
or
whether
it
be
a
state
employee.
in
most
state
governmental
situations
you
are
dealing
with
a
rule
of
immunity
which
is
somewhat
less
protective
and
they
do
vary
all
over
the
lot.
but
you
are
also
dealing
with
in
almost
every
state,
at
least
the
vast
majority,
an
indemnification
provision
which
indemnifies
for
almost
any
liability
that
they
might
suffer.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
defendant
in
order
to
answer
that
question.
and
the
answer
is
that
the
united
states
government
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
governing.
and
congress
has
decided
that
that
responsibility
includes
a
whole
range
of
activities.
it
cannot
be
tortious
for
the
united
states
government
to
govern.
and
it
is
a
substantial
burden
and
a
substantial
disruption
of
that
ability
to
govern
if
individual
employees
of
the
government
are
going
to
be
held
liable
when
they
take
a
step
that
involves
any
judgment
at
all
on
their
part
and
they
may
personally
be
held
liable
in
a
situation
where
the
united
states
government
has
not
decided
and
does
not
have
to
decide
to
indemnify
them.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
the
best
answer
to
that
is
the
answer
that
was
given
both
by
judge
learned
hand
and
by
this
court
in
barr
v.
matteo,
which
is
that
if
we
could
know
in
advance
which
individual
government
employees
were
acting
improperly
before
a
suit
was
brought,
and
we
could
single
them
out
and
say
we're
going
to
allow
actions
but
only
against
the
bad
guys,
only
against
the
ones
that
do
something
wrong
because
we
want
those
people
to
be
accountable
and
we
want
them
to
stop
it,
and
we
want
to
make
them
pay.
the
trouble
is
that
you
can't
do
that.
you
can't
know
in
advance.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
the
driving
situation,
justice
stevens,
i
think
is
different
because
of
the
nature
of
the
rules
and
the
relationship.
when
you're
talking
about
driving,
you're
talking
about
people
using
the
common
roads.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
there
is.
i
think
the
difference
is
that
the
rules
of
the
road
must
govern
everyone
or
they
don't
work.
the
rules
of
liability
for
dropping
paint
buckets
or
whatever
it
is
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
about.
i
think
you
have
a
balance
when
you
have
the
federal
government
acting,
you
necessarily
have
a
balance
of
that
federal
governmental
function
against
the
loss
of
a
right
of
action
of
an
individual.
and
the
rule
that's
been
laid
down
by
this
court
in
barr
v.
matteo
and
to
a
less
explicit
extent
in
the
constitutional
cases
dealing
with
qualified
immunity
is
a
rule
that
says
there's
a
trade
off
and
to
this
degree,
we're
going
to
make
it
in
favor
of
protecting
the
governmental
functioning.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
we
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
a
very
complicated
answer.
and
it
has
to
be
an
integration,
a
looking
at
both
the
state
law
rule
and
the
rules,
statutes,
authorizations
directing
the
federal
employee
to
perform
his
job.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
in
terms
of
whether
he
can
be
sued
for
personal
liability,
our
position
is
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--whether
in
fact
it's
proper
for
him
to?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
in
that
situation
my
own
sense
would
be
not
having
researched
the
federal
statutes
saying
what
a
particular
painter
should
do
or
what
a
particular
agency
painting
should
do,
my
sense
is
that
probably
the
state
law
would
apply.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
right,
that's
right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
he
does
it
maliciously.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--our
position
in
this
case
is--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
that's
exactly
right,
justice
marshall.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
that's
what
he
said.
and
i
think
that
is
the
logical
implication
of
our
view.
now,--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that's
right.
the
action
certainly
was
intentional.
maybe
i
can
make
more
clear
and
more
explicit
the
concerns
on
the
federal
functioning
side
of
the
ledger
by
going
through
them
briefly
in
terms
of
what
we're
talking
about.
it's
really
not
very
hard
to
come
up
with
a
parade
of
horribles,
cases
where
everybody
would
like,
if
you
start
with
the
assumption
that
some
federal
employee
has
done
something
dreadful,
there's
a
strong
gut
desire
to
want
to
find
him
liable.
but
you've
also
got
to
think
about
the
many
many
cases
that
are
going
to
be
brought
where
federal
employees
in
fact
have
not
done
anything
wrong
and
are
going
to
be
put
through
a
variety
of
trials.
the
effects
that
that's
going
to
have.
even
leaving
aside
any
question
of
discretion
on
that
person's
part
are
going
to
be
first
a
general
inhibition
from
the
performance
of
the
job.
if
a
person
is
exposed
to
a
potential
personal
liability
and
having
to
go
through
law
suits,
a
rational
response
and
the
one
that
we
can
anticipate--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
you
would
have
to
look
and
see
what
the
indemnification
arrangements
were
for
the
general
motors
employee.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
but
does
the
federal
government
have
to
indemnify
its
employees?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
the
difference
i
think
is
that
the
business
of
the
government
is
not
to
be
equated
with
the
business
of
a
private
corporation.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
because
the
reasons
i
would
give
you
are
that
it's
going
to
inhibit
in
a
general
way
and
in
a
very
specific
way,
it's
going
to
inhibit
employees
from
wanting
to
take
the
jobs
and/or
to
do
the
things
that
may
create
the
greatest
exposure.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
we
think
the
painting
of
the
building
is
one
case.
let's
take
for
example,--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about,
justice
brennan,
is
whether
the
policy
and
planning
rule
that
was
enunciated
by
the
eleventh
circuit,
not
in
this
specific
case
but
in
a
later
case
as
their
circuit's
rule,
whether
that
is
what
should
govern.
and
it's
our
view
very
strongly--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--very
limiting
rule.
and
we
think
that
there's
two
things
wrong
with
it.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
they
called
it
policy
and
planning.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
want
to
make
two
points
about
that:
number
one,
we
do
very
strongly
believe
that
an
absolute
immunity
is
appropriate
whenever
a
federal
employee
acts
within
the
scope
of
his
duty,
within
the
outer
perimeter
of
his
duties.
we
are
here
in
this
case--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
reading.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
of
the
court's
decisions
in
barr
and
the
court's
decision
in
spalding.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
don't
think
you
did.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
but
in
response
to
that,
i'd
just
like
to
say
that
there
is
a
discussion
in
barr
in
the
plurality
opinion
relating
to
the
exercise
of
discretion.
that
discussion
of
discretion,
if
one
reads
it
carefully
i
think
is
fairly
understood
to
define
the
outer
limits,
the
outer
perimeter
of
authority
and
is
not
a
requirement
of
discretion.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
we
are
applying
the
discretion
test
which
is
in
footnote
14
of
this
court's
decision
in
davis
v.
scherer
that
says
that
when
a
particular
task
is
not
specifically
defined,
when
it
isn't
prescribed
what
an
employee
must
do,
he
is
exercising
discretion,
and
the
discretion
that
is
involved
here
is
in
the
performance
that
three
defendants
are
supervisors
at
this
army
depot,
and
they
oversee
the
work
of
the
depot
which
includes
the
letting
off
of
materiel,
the
repackaging,
the
moving
around
and
sending
out
of
materiel,
and
the
storage.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
if
we
don't
have
a
rule
of
immunity
there
is
a
significant
for
any
job
that
involves
risks
that
someone
may
be
hurt
and
therefore
may
want
to
sue,
we're
creating
a
situation
where
the
cost
of
doing
that
job
increases
to
the
government,
where
individual
employees
if
they
have
any
discretion
are
likely
to
shade
that
discretion
and
make
decisions
in
a
way
that
is
not
necessarily
in
the
interest
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
in
the
way
the
work
was
done,
in
where
they
were
put
when
they
were
brought
in,
in
who
was
assigned
to
do
it
and
whether
safety
equipment
was
used,
if
any
was
necessary,
in
how
the
job
was
done.
and
we
think
that
those
are
clearly
discretionary
decisions
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decision
in
davis
v.
scherer.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
there
is
a
real
question
in
any
case
where
there's
any
discretion
how
that
discretion's
going
to
be
exercised,
and
which
way,
how
are
we
going
to
do
the
job.
and
the
question
is
whether
we
want
that
judgment
to
be
shaded
by
concern
about
liability.
if
i
may
do
so,
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
the
point
i'd
like
to
emphasize
more
than
any
other
is
that
immunity
only
has
any
useful
effect
if
there
is
some
measure
of
certainty
for
the
employees
who
are
protected
by
it.
and
the
rule
that's
been
announced
here,
a
rule
of
policy
and
planning
discretion
is
a
rule
that
has
no
certainty
whatsoever.
you
can
inject
into
it
all
sorts
of
different
considerations
and
courts
certainly
will
if
that
turns
out
to
be
the
law.
we
can
talk
about
whether
activity
is
governmental,
we
can
talk
about
how
far
removed
the
supervisor
is
from
the
individual
who
is
really
affected.
there's
an
endless
list
of
considerations
one
could
think
about.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
some
meaning,
any,
justice
white.
and
we
think
that
it
does
indeed
provide
a
significant
measure
of
certainty
if
it's
taken
that
way.
if
it
is
elevated
to
some
level
of
what
color
collar
does
someone
wear
or
something
like
that,
indeed
it
will
not.
but
if
every
action
where
the
precise
conduct
is
not
prescribed
by
law
is
protected,
and
that's
the
definition
this
court
used
in
its
footnote
in
davis
v.
scherer,
whenever
it's
not
prescribed.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
if
the
law
says
don't
let
any
employees
stack
soda
ash
without
wearing
gloves,--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--we're
pretty
close
to
a
per
se
rule.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
terribly
important,
because
it's
the
operational
level
where
the
conflict
comes.
it's
when
an
employee
is
fired,
it's
when
a
grant
is
denied.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
excuse
me?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
there
could
be
regulations
if
indeed
soda
ash
were
a
dangerous
substance,
which
it
is
not.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
there
could
be
regulations
that
say--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that
is
lower
than
that?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
that
there
are
activities
that
are
non-discretionary
such
as
a
file
clerk
in
a
government
office
who
stamps
deeds
or
documents--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--it's
less
discretionary,
we
think.
but
we
think
that
for
the
supervisor
directing
the
handling
of
chemicals
or
other
substances,
he
has
a
lot
of
discretion
as
to
how
the
job
is
done.
and
to
say
that
he
doesn't
is
really
rejecting
the
question
of
discretion
at
all,
and
just
looking
at
the
level
of
the
position.
