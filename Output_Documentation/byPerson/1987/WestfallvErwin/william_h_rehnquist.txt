chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
86-714,
rodney
p.
westfall
versus
william
t.
erwin.
mr.
ayer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
is
the
barr
against
matteo
and
howard
against
lyons
line
of
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
some
analogy
here
to
clearfield
trust?
it
seems
to
me
there's
as
much
analogy
to
that
kind
of
federal
common
law
as
there
is
to
the
negative
commerce
clause.
where
in
effect
you
know
the
government
deals
in
checks,
we
need
to
know
when
these
things
or
what
rule
they're
going
to
be
governed
by,
they're
in
all
fifty
states,
so
we
don't
follow
the
state
rule
in
every
single
case.
not
as
a
matter
of
necessarily
some
at
least
explicit
constitutional
doctrine,
but
just
as
i
suppose
you
say,
if
congress
had
thought
about
it,
or
the
court
will
think
about
it
for
congress,
that's
the
sort
of
rule
there
ought
to
be.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
ayer,
is
there
anything
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
substitutes
the
liability
of
the
united
states
for
the
liability
of
the
individual
actor
as
a
defendant?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
doesn't
the
plaintiff
in
a
case
like
that
just
sue
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
it's
like
when
you're
covered
by
workmen's
compensation,
a
private
employee,
you
try
to
find
some
other
person
to
sue
so
that
you
can
get
a
tort
recovery
rather
than
a
workmen's
compensation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you
are
talking
about
mr.
barr
in
barr
v.
matteo,
i
think
what
you
say
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense.
but
if
you're
talking
about
someone
who's
painting
a
building,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
quite
a
different
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ayer.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
alspaugh.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
would
the
sufficiency
of
the
federal
workers'
compensation
provision
preclude
or
not
preclude
suit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
thought
your
argument
was
based
on
the
idea
that
here
the
workmen's
compensation
award
was
somehow
inadequate
and
if
it
had
been
more
adequate,
then
perhaps
the
suit
against
the
co-employee
would
be
barred.
i
don't
think
there's
much
ground
for
making
that
distinction,
is
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
for
a
court
extending
immunity?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
didn't
the
court
in
the
majority
in
dalehite
v.
united
states
hold
that
the
stacking
of
the
fertilizer
on
the
depot
down
in
texas
was
a
discretionary
function?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
reason
why
that
same
sort
of
discretionary
analysis
shouldn't
be
applied
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
quarrel
then
with
the
dalehite
majority's
principle
as
a
guide
in
this
area.
you
just
say
the
facts
here
are
different
than
dalehite?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean,
just
because
it
was
the
government
doing
it.
although
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
could
have
been
stacked
at
general
motors
or
olin-mathieson
or
anywhere
else,
if
the
government
decides
to
do
it,
it's
governmental?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
never
read
that
that
way.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
was
the
state
law
of
alabama
that
governed
this
case
at
the
time
these
defendants
acted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
wasn't
something
that
would
have
governed
the
conduct
of
these
defendants.
what
did
alabama
law
have,
you
take
due
care
that
you
don't
injure
other
people?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so
the
question
of
qualified
immunity
is
whether
you
knew
that
was
the
law
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
alspaugh.
mr.
ayer,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ayer.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
westfall
against
erwin,
no.86-714
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
