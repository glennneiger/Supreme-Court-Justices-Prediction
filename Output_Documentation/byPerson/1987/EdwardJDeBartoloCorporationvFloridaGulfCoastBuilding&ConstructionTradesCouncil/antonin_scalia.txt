justice
scalia
mr.
cohen,
suppose
congress
is
concerned
about
the
trade
imbalance
and
it
makes
it
unlawful
to
picket
in
order
to
make
somebody
cease
doing
business
with
a
foreign
country,
and
you
have
a
labor
union
that
pickets
the
same
mall,
say
this
mall
is
selling
products
of
south
africa
or
you
pick
your
country,
the
soviet
union
or
whatever,
could
the
government
enforce
that
prohibition?
justice
scalia
well,
they
do
the
same
thing.
they
just
hand
bill.
they
say
please
don't
patronize
this
mall,
this
mall
sells
products
of
south
africa.
congress
has
passed
a
law
that
says
you
can't
do
that,
you
can't
coerce
somebody
not
to
carry
the
products
of
a
of
a
foreign
country.
justice
scalia
what's
the--
justice
scalia
--why?
justice
scalia
he
wasn't
watching.
i
think
you
could
have
gotten
away
with
the
end
of
that
sentence.
justice
scalia
but
that's
not
unusual,
mr.
gold.
let's
take
an
antitrust
case
in
which
a
bunch
of
distributors
ban
together
and
go
to
the
manufacturer
and
they
say,
we
want
you
to
cut
off
this
other
distributor
because
he's
selling
at
too
low
prices.
now,
there
are
those
who
think
that
would
be
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
the
manufacturer
is
entitled
to
cut
off
any
distributor
he
wants
to.
so,
he's
entitled
to
get
that
kind
of
information,
that
kind
of
urging
from
the
distributors,
and,
yet,
it
is
made
unlawful
for
the
distributors
to
induce
him
to
do
that.
now,
why
is
that
any
different
from
what's
at
issue
here?
i
mean,
the
principle
that
you
can't
forbid
someone
from
inducing
somebody
else
to
do
something
that
he's
perfectly
entitled
to
do
is
it
doesn't
prove
your
case.
justice
scalia
well,
if
you
limit
it
to
consumer,
i
can't
think
of
a
parallel,
but
it
seems
to
me
what
i've
just
given
you
is
a
precise
parallel.
the
manufacturer
is
entitled,
if
he
wishes,
to
cut
off
a
distributor,
but
if
a
bunch
of
distributors
get
together
to
induce
him
to
do
that,
that
inducing
of
him
can
be
made
unlawful.
it's
the
same
thing
here.
the
customer
is
entitled
not
to
shop
at
the
mall.
that's
up
to
the
customer,
but
the
congress
has
said
the
union
cannot
induce
the
customer
to
do
that.
i
don't
know
any
principle
in
the
law,
in
other
words,
that
you
can't
make
it
unlawful
to
try
to
induce
somebody
to
do
something
which
he
has
a
legal
right
to
do.
justice
scalia
doesn't
it
depend
on
the
purpose
of
it?
can't
you
make
it
bad
depending
on
the
purpose?
let's
assume
someone
comes
up
to
the
people
in
the
mall
and
says,
i'm
selling
protection.
for
a
certain
payment
a
month,
i
will
not
tell
the
customers
what
a
filthy
place
you
have
here,
that
there
are
cockroaches
and
unsanitary
conditions
in
your
restaurant.
justice
scalia
if
you
pay
me
$30
a
month,
i
won't
tell
them.
now,--
justice
scalia
--right,
and
one
can
do
that,
even
though
the
customers
are
entitled
to
know
how
dirty
the
place
is
and
you
have
a
1st
amendment
right
to
tell
the
customers
how
dirty
the
place
is.
it
can
be
made
unlawful
if
you
tell
them
that
for
a
certain
purpose
or
if
you
threaten
to
tell
them
that
for
a
certain
purpose.
justice
scalia
let's
hear
a
good
argument
for
safeco.
justice
scalia
that's
the
explanation.
why
would
they
limit
the
proviso
to
situations
in
which
there's
a
primary
dispute
with
an
employer
whose
products
are
being
distributed
by
another
employer?
justice
scalia
but
if
the
reason
for
including
it
is
to
show
we
don't
mean
speech
to
be
covered,
they
wouldn't
have
put
in
there
distributed
by
another.
they
would
have
just
put
in
just
shall
be
construed
to
prohibit
publicity
other
than
picketing
period.
