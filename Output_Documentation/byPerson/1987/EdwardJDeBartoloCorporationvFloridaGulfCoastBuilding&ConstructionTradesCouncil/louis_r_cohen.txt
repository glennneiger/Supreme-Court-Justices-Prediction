mr.
louis
r.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
the
union
is
claiming
in
this
case
is
that
it
has
a
constitutional
right
to
do
exactly
what
congress
has
forbidden,
if
enough
shoppers
in
the
east
lake
square
mall
agree
with
it.
congress
said
thou
shall
not
coerce
the
neutral
businesses
in
the
mall
into
helping
in
the
dispute
with
high's,
and
the
union's
core
claim
is
that
it
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
put
that
prohibition
to
a
sort
of
shoppers'
referendum,
to
issue
an
explicit
call
for
a
secondary
boycott
and
ask
the
shoppers
to
decide
that
the
neutral
businesses
should
be
coerced
after
all.
some
calls
for
boycott,
of
course,
receive
the
highest
constitutional
protection.
claiborne
hardware
and
citizens
for
a
better
austin
are
leading
examples.
but
the
court
has
said
repeatedly,
including
in
claiborne
hardware,
that
the
tactics
used
by
the
combatants
in
a
particular
labor
dispute
are
not
entitled
to
that
level
of
protection.
in
particular,
the
court
said
in
claiborne
hardware,
secondary
boycotts
by
labor
unions
may
be
prohibited
in
the
interests
of
preventing
the
coerced
participation
of
neutrals
in
industrial
strife.
professor
cox
put
it
this
way
in
his
comment
on
safeco,
he
said,
"requests
for
immediate
assistance
in
putting
economic
pressure
upon
one
with
whom
the
speaker
is
engaged
in
driving
a
private
business
bargain
are
readily
distinguishable
from
words
looking
forward
to
political
action.
"
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
objects
of
the
coercion
in
this
case
are
the
other
stores
in
the
mall
who
have
no
relation
to
any
of
the
parties,
either
of
the
parties
to
the
dispute,
but
who
the
union
felt
would
be
in
a
position
to
bring
pressure
on
the
mall
owner,
to
bring
pressure
on
their
co-tenant,
wilson's,
to
bring
pressure
on
its
contractor,
high's,
to
offer
better
wages
and
conditions
to
its
employees.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it
is
the
coercion
of
the
neutral
stores
in
the
mall,
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
coercion
takes
the
form
of
asking
shoppers
not
to
patronize
the
neutral
stores
so
that
the
neutral
stores
will
be
afraid
that
they
will
lose
business,
unless
they
become
involved
in
somebody
else's
dispute
and
enter
that
dispute
on
the
union's
side.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
there
isn't
any
requirement
of
an
additional
level
of
coercion.
indeed,
the
shoppers
may
be
people
who
are
willing
supporters
of
the
union,
who
are
merely
waiting
for
the
union
to
give
them
a
signal
by
the
hand
bills
or
picket
signs
as
to
what
they
can
do
to
help.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
the
help
that
the
union
may
not
ask
of
them
is
help
bringing
innocent
bystanders,
who
are
merely
subject
to
economic
pressure,
into
the
dispute
to
help
the
union
win
it.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it
is
exactly,
we
think,
the
same
kind
of
coercion
as
would
be
involved
in
picketing.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
that
the--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
that
the
effectiveness
of
the
delivery
of
the
message
can
vary
in
a
picketing
case
and
can
vary
in
a
hand
billing
case.
here,
you
had
a
hand
bill
distribution
continuously
over
a
three-week
period
during
the
christmas
season
at
all
four
entrances
to
a
shopping
mall.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
we
think
it
is
the
same
constitutional
issue.
there
are
differences
between
hand
billing
and
other
methods
of
distribution
and
picketing,
but
this
case
doesn't
differ
in
any
constitutional-irrelevant
respect
from,
for
example,
safeco.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
it
is
a
case
of
regulation
of
tactics
which
are,
by
their
nature,
expressive
tactics
in
a
labor
dispute.
i
think
the
question
is
whether
this
is
one
of
the,
to
quote
the
court
going
all
the
way
back
to
thornhill,
"one
of
the
permissible
limits
on
the
conduct
of
the
disputants
in
a
particular
labor
dispute.
"
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
it
should
be
judged
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
an
effective
communication
with
a
message.
i
think
in
that
respect,
it
doesn't
differ
from
safeco.
picketing
does
present
some
problems
that
warrant
regulation,
but
the
court
has
made
it
very
clear
more
than
once
that
regulation
of
picketing
as
such
must
be
content-neutral.
if
it's
constitutional
to
regulate
particular
picketing,
solely
because
it
conveys
a
message,
do
not
shop
at
neutral
stores,
when
that's
used
as
an
expressive
tactic
in
a
labor
dispute,
that's
got
to
be
because
it's
constitutional
and
to
regulate
that
message
however
it
is
effectively
delivered.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
picketer
carries
a
message.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
one
difference
is
that
the
message,
do
not
shop,
may
not
be
on
the
picket
sign.
the
presence
of
the
picketer
may
imply
that
message,
but,
of
course,
that
message
was
explicit
here.
let
me
put
it
a
different
way
in
terms
of
safeco.
i
think
safeco
would
have
been
easy
on
the
statutory
question
and
it
wouldn't
have
divided
this
court
six
to
three
on
that
question
if
there
had
been
disorder
or
if
there
had
been
a
violation
of
a
neutral
time,
place
and
manner
restriction
or
if
there
had
been
physical
or
psychological
barring
of
the
doors
or,
indeed,
if
there
had
been
signalling
to
other
union
members.
the
court
found
the
conduct
of
the
safeco
pickets
unlawful
because,
and
i'm
quoting
the
court,
"they
were
trying
to
persuade
the
customers
of
the
secondary
employer
to
cease
trading
with
him.
"
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
in
the
labor
context
where
what
you
had
was
not
picketing
but
other
signalling
to
union
members--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
probably,
i
think
probably
not.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
probably
congress
cannot
do
that.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
because
that
is
raising
an
issue
of
public
importance
on
which
there
is
a
fully-protected
constitutional
right
to
speak,
but--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
tried
that
once.
