mr.
lawrence
gold
that
might
have
been
discretion
rather
than
valor.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
wish
to
begin
by
recharacterizing
what
the
union's
message
is
in
this
case
from
what
debartolo's
counsel
said
it
was.
the
union's
message
is
set
out
in
full
in
the
appendix
to
the
red
brief,
and
the
message
is
not
simply
that
high's,
the
construction
company,
pays
sub-standard
wages;
it
is
that
there
are
a
series
of
relations
here
between
the
tenants,
the
mall
owner,
wilson's
department
store,
and
high's.
the
relationships,
insofar
as
they
support
giving
business
to
high's
to
do
the
construction,
is
contrary
to
some
important
social
interests,
buying
power
of
people,
community
interests
in
adequate
demand
along
keansian
lines,
although
there's
no
citation
of
that
in
the
hand
bill,
and
argues
that
given
this
set
of
relationships,
the
mall
tenants
and
the
mall
owner
are
blame-worthy
insofar
as
they
are
supporting
what
high's
is
doing
and
how
it's
treating
its
employees,
and
on
the
basis
of
that
argument,
the
union
asks
people
to
make
their
judgment,
please
don't
patronize,
and
to
show
their
disapproval
of
these
arrangements.
the
facts
are
fairly
set
out.
the
message
is
temperate.
there
was
no
picketing
or
patrolling.
no
misconduct
of
any
kind.
and
the
way
that
the
board
would
read
the
statute
at
the
present
time,
although
it
has
never
so
read
it
before
the
remand
and
the
decision
in
this
case,
is
that
that
message
can
be
obliterated
from
the
face
of
this
country.
unions
may
not
make
that
argument
to
members
of
the
general
public
who
owe
the
union
no
fealty
and
they
may
not
do
it
no
matter
what
method
of
communication
is
used
and
how
the
point
is
made.
mr.
lawrence
gold
that
is
correct.
the
union
is
completely
silenced.
this
is
a
restraint,
a
prior
restraint
on
all
forms
of
making
this
of
communicating
this
message,
this
argument,
to
any
member
of
the
public
under
any
circumstance.
mr.
lawrence
gold
well,
we
believe,
based
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
if
the
statute
was
directed
at
leafleting,
in
other
words,
if
congress
said
that
the
streets
are
close
to
union
that
want
to
communicate
this
message
with
this
viewpoint,
that
would
be
unlawful
because
leafleting
has
always
been
regarded
by
this
court
from
schneider
v.
state
on
as
a
form
of
pure
speech.
my
only
point,
justice
white,
is
that
i
don't
have
to
carry
that
burden.
the
argument
here
is
that
this
message,
because
it
may
have
an
adverse
effect
on
these
store
owners,
if
members
of
the
public
are
persuaded
by
it,
is
subject
to
total
ban,
and
that
is
the
situation
we
find
ourselves
in.
that
is
why
we
are
in
the
dock,
because
we
have
made
this
argument
to
members
of
the
general
public,
and
i
wish
to
emphasize
in
the
regard
that
in
contrast
to
the
standards
secondary
boycott
cases,
if
i
can
call
them
that,
that
have
come
to
this
court
before,
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
message
is
directed
at
people
who
have
a
total
absolute
right,
a
freedom
maybe
more
accurate,
to
act
on
the
message
without
violating
any
law.
congress
has
not
required
and
has
never
required,
i
don't
know
of
any
legislature
that
has
ever
required,
anyone
to
shop
at
a
store
whose
policies
that
person
finds
unpleasant,
wrongful,
in
any
way.
so,
this--
mr.
lawrence
gold
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
insofar
as
congress
regulates
the
underlying
actions,
you
have
a
different
case.
that
has
been
the
rule
and
that's
why
i
used
it
in
terms
of
the
secondary
boycott
cases.
secondary
strikes,
strikes
by
a
group
of
workers
against
a
neutral
employer
are
banned,
and
to
that
extent,
if
you
seek
to
induce
them
to
engage
in
unlawful
activity,
that
is
prohibited,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
law
which
limits
the
right
of
individuals
acting
as
individual
consumers,
acting
as
individuals,--
mr.
lawrence
gold
--i
really
am
hard-pressed.
i'm
not
clear
enough
on
the
antitrust
law
whether
the
combination,
except
insofar
as
it's
a
combination
directed
at
other
distributors
who
are
in
competition,
insofar
as
it
simply
made
a
reasoned
argument
even
to
a
manufacturer,
has
ever
been
made
unlawful.
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
in
this
court
in
terms
of
the
1st
amendment
which
has
provided
that
a
message
advising
people
of
facts
and
circumstances,
individuals
of
facts
and
circumstances,
on
which
they
have
the
right
to
act,
has
been
successfully
banned,
even
though
you're
not
asking
for
unlawful
activity.
indeed,--
mr.
lawrence
gold
--well,
i
don't--
mr.
lawrence
gold
--i
don't
know
of
any
state
that
doesn't
have
a
blackmail
law.
mr.
lawrence
gold
well,
i'm
just
not
certain
of
that,
and
there's
no
social
purpose
of
the
1st
amendment
which
is
furthered
by
non-communication
in
exchange
for
money,
but
if
the
1st
amendment
doesn't
protect
your
communication
at
least
when
you're
not
talking
about
commercial
speech,
not
in
the
posados
controversy
that,
you
know,
the
puerto
rican
gambling
case
that
the
court
had
two
years
ago,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
which
says
that
a
communication
advising
people
of
the
facts
and
making
an
argument
to
them
and
asking
them
to
do
something
which
they
have
a
lawful
right
to
do
and
which
is
not
banned
in
any
way
would
withstand
constitutional
muster.
certainly,
the
1st
amendment
would
be
a
far
narrower
protection
of
the
right
for
people
to
argue
and
persuade
on
basic
matters
if
it
reaches
activity
which
is
argument
and
persuasion
directed
at
entirely
lawful
ends.
mr.
lawrence
gold
no.
i
think
the
label
of
being
a
union
doesn't
deprive
us
of
our
constitutional
and
civil
rights.
i
mean,
there's
an
argument
here
suggesting
that
even
though
we're
engaged
in
activity
which,
on
its
face,
is
perfectly
appropriate
because
we're
a
union
and
otherwise
regulated,
that
the
regulation
is
somehow
all
right.
that
just
hasn't
been
the
trend
in
this
court's
cases,
and
even--
mr.
lawrence
gold
--as
the
losing
advocate
in
safeco,
i--
mr.
lawrence
gold
--i'm
not
about
to
try
it,
but
i
would
hate
to
redouble
my
losses.
from
day
one,
and
this
was
the
understanding
at
the
time
that
congress
acted
in
1959,
the
jurisprudence
in
this
court
has
been
that
picketing
is
different
from
leafleting,
taking
out
advertisements
and
so
on,
and
that
that
has
been
the
law
in
general.
now,
the
opinions
and
we've
reviewed
the
opinions,
obviously
we
can
only
reproduce
the
court's
words,
are
replete
with
discussions
of
picketing.
if
i
can,
back
in
hughes
v.
superior
court,
which
is
the
fountain
head
of
these
cases,
the
court
said
while
picketing
is
a
mode
of
communication,
it
is
inseparably
something
more
indifferent.
industrial
picketing
is
more
than
free
speech.
publication
in
the
newspaper
or
by
distribution
circulars
may
convey
the
same
information
or
make
the
same
charge
as
do
those
patrolling
a
picket
line,
but
the
very
purpose
of
the
picket
line
is
to
exert
influences
and
it
produces
consequences
different
from
other
modes
of
communication.
mr.
lawrence
gold
gibboney
was
a
case
which
involved
picketing
in
part,
but
it
also
involved
secondary
strikes
under
union
discipline.
we
don't
deny
and
it's
been
a
long
time
since
we've
had
much
of
an
argument
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
strike,
but
that
isn't
what
we're
talking
about
here.
the
question
is
similar
to
one
that
could
have
been
asked,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
central
hudson
line
of
cases.
one
of
the
central
hudson
issues
was
whether
institutional
advertising,
talking
about
the
desirability
of
nuclear
power,
was
tree
free
speech
to
be
judged
on
true
free
speech
based
on
not.
the
answer
wasn't
this
utility
is
regulated
and
therefore
the
regulatory
authority
can
do
whatever
it
chooses
as
a
guid
pro
quo.
the
understanding
was
that
the
real
question,
and
this
is
the
point,
too,
of
colautti,
that
the
real
question
is
what
does
free
speech
demand.
what
are
the
interests
of
the
listeners?
what
is
the
interests
of
the
society?
the
court
said
in
colautti,
to
say
that
a
corporation
can't
speak
was
to
ask
the
wrong
question.
the
real
question
was
what
was
the
1st
amendment
about.
was
the
message
one
which
deserved
to
be
heard
which
was
part
of
the
continuing
dialogue
by
which
we
build
this
country.
mr.
lawrence
gold
yes.
yes,
indeed.
although
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
fall
one
step
short
of
this,
and
this
is
the
issue
that
the
court
was
so
conscious
of
in
the
ohralik
case
in
436
u.s.
and
in
re
primus;
namely
whether
we
are
going
to
have
not
only
the
paradox
of
first
picketing
being
said
to
be
different
from
leafleting
and
newspaper
advertising
and
then
gobble
it
up,
but
also
whether
we're
going
to
have
another
paradox,
namely
the
overruling
of
valentine
v.
chrestensen,
leading
to
the
conclusion
that
commercial
speech
is
not
limited
to
offers
to
buy
and
sell
of
a
commercial
kind,
building
going
to
start
to
chew
up
other
aspects
of
what
has
historically
been
part
of
the
1st
amendment.
after
all,
the
lead
case
with
regard
to
the
1st
amendment
and
all
of
this
is
thornhill
v.
alabama,
and
although
thornhill
v.
alabama
has
not
survived
as
a
picketing
case,
it
certainly
has
survived
as
colautti
shows
and
as
other
cases
show
in
terms
of
what
we
understand
to
be
the
generous
confines
of
the
1st
amendment.
whether
the
issue
is
one
raised
by
a
community
group,
saying
that,
as
justice
scalia's
example
suggests,
that
someone
is
running
his
business
in
a
way
which
is
contrary
to
the
interests
of
the
society
by
investing
in
south
africa
or
by
moving
facilities
overseas
or
whether
the
argument
is
that
the
employers
in
general
have
moved
to
such
a
strong
position
in
the
society
that
they're
hurting
the
society
by
not
providing
adequate
health
and
safety,
by
violating
the
rights
of
women
or
minorities,
whatever
the
issue
is,
it
seems
to
us
that
those
issues
have
always
been
understood
to
be
part
of
a
public
dialogue.
a
particular
dispute,
whether
it
is
the
dispute
that
generated
thomas
v.
collins,
whether
a
union
leader
could
go
to
texas
and
make
a
speech
asking
people
to
join
the
union,
which
was
held
to
be
true
free
speech,
or
thornhill,
where
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
a
particular
factory,
those
are
the
nuclei
around
which
public
debate
is
fashioned.
mr.
lawrence
gold
i
don't
know
whether
this
interest
that
is
asserted
ought
to
suffice
even
in
that
context.
i'd
like
to
take
it
in
two
parts.
first
of
all,
in
organizations
for
a
better
austin,
as
you
raised,
if
this
is
a
case
which,
like
that
case,
is
to
be
judged
under
the
standards
applied
to
speech
generally,
it
seems
to
us
that
protecting
these
neutrals,
these
secondary
employers
and
their
right
to
have
any
business
relationships
they
want,
without
anybody
knowing
about
it,
and
without
being
able
to
make
their
own
judgments
about
whether
that's
good
or
bad,
is
plainly
not
a
sufficient
interest.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
it
was
not
simply
the
state
was
not
simply
protecting
a
particular
business
man
there
as
mr.
cohen
was
suggesting.
it
was
protecting
a
basic
right
of
privacy,
though
the
leafleting,
the
demonstrating
in
that
case
was
taken
to
the
individual's
home
and
his
home
territory,
and
as
the
court
noted
in
carey
v.
brown
and
this
is
going
to
be
a
debate
that
continues
this
term
from
the
cert
grants,
the
question
of
whether
the
privacy
interests
in
neighborhoods
and
homes
is
sufficient
to
limit
expressive
conducts.
so,
that
was
not
a
small
interest,
but
going
on,
if
the
test
here
is
the
test
of
central
hudson,
we
don't
believe
that
this
is
narrowly
limited.
even
in
central
hudson,
the
complete
ban
did
not
stand
up
to
scrutiny
under
that
test
and
we
don't
believe
that
saying
that
this
message
is
obliterated
so
long
as
it's
forwarded
by
union
is
obliterated
from
this
society,
is
one
that
can
possibly
be
justified
by
this
supposed
interest
in
industrial
peace.
we're
not
disrupting
industrial
peace
in
any
sense
other
than
telling
people
facts
which
they
have
a
right
to
know
which
they
either
will
believe
or
won't
believe,
will
find
convincing
or
won't
find
convincing,
and
will
either
act
on
or
not.
i
don't
think
that
any
of
this,
if
i
may,
would
come
as
any
great
surprise
to
the
1959
congress
because
the
point
that
given
the
nature
of
the
discussion
with
my
colleagues
i
jumped
over
and
very
improperly
is
that
it
is
our
position
that
the
board
has
misread
this
statute.
the
constitutional
background
is
critical
to
making
that
argument.
so,
i
also
started
as
i
did
in
part
for
that
reason,
but
in
the
first
debartolo
case,
and
in
the
bishop
of
chicago
case,
the
court
has
made
it
plain
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
when
congress
uses
words
which
could
be
applied
to
expressive
conduct,
that
language
is
to
be
read
narrowly
if
it
is
at
all
possible
to
do
so.
indeed,
in
bishop
of
chicago,
the
court
said
that
there
had
to
be
an
affirmative
indication
of
legislative
history.
the
congress
focused
on
the
particular
expressive
activity
and
decided
to
prohibit
it.
certainly,
as
this
court
has
made
plain
many
times
in
the
labor
act
context,
the
words
"threaten",
"restrain"
and
"coerce"
are
not
words
with
a
single
definite
meaning,
and,
in
reality,
what
this
case
comes
down
to
insofar
as
the
board
makes
a
statutory
argument,
aside
from
the
fact
that
it
started
from
a
totally
erroneous
premise
and
didn't
grant
us
the
presumption
that
the
court
stated,
is
to
say
that
the
fact
that
there
is
not
only
threaten
and
restrain
and
coerce
in
the
statute,
but
there
is
this
publicity
proviso
which,
as
the
court
said
in
terms,
is
more
limited
than
the
situation
here,
creates
a
negative
inference
and
shows
that
congress
intended
in
using
the
words
"threaten",
"restrain"
and
"coerce"
to
reach
this
kind
of
reasoned
non-picketing
appeal
to
consumers.
the
language
of
publicity
proviso,
among
other
places,
is
set
out
at
page
23
of
our
brief.
i
want
to
note
two
points
about
the
language.
first
of
all,
it's
in
the
form
saying
that
nothing
contained
in
the
overall
section
shall
be
construed
to
prohibit
a
particular
kind
of
picketing.
that
language
was
added
in
conference
in
a
situation
where
the
house
had
a
bill
which
prohibited
threatening,
restraining
and
coercing
and
the
senate
had
no
provision.
opponents
of
the
house
language
had
claimed
that
it
might
reach
pure
speech
activity.
no
proponent
of
the
language
had
over
so
claimed.
at
that
point,
the
conference
ensued.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
two
fair
way
of
understanding
what
happened
in
that
conference.
i
was
not
there.
none
of
the
legislators
have
both
kissed
and
told.
what
one
is
that
the
house
conferees
said
to
the
senate,
what
is
it
that
you're
afraid
of,
what
do
you
think
we
have
up
our
sleeve,
and
the
senate
conferees
said,
we
believe
that
this
language
could
reach
not
only
picketing,
which
we
all
agree
is
subject
to
a
greater
degree
of
regulation,
both
in
the
labor
and
non-labor
context
since
hughes
v.
superior
court
was
not
a
case
involving
a
union,
but
would
also
reach
other
forms
of
expressive
activity
in
the
example
that
president
eisenhower
had
given
in
his
speech,
which
was
an
example
involving
a
producer-distributor
relationship,
and
that
the
house
people
said,
we
don't
intend
to
do
that,
and
we'll
show
you
we
don't
intend
to
do
that.
you're
afraid
we're
going
to
do
that.
we
will
state
in
so
many
words
we
have
no
intention
of
doing
that
because
we
really
do
not.
another
way--
mr.
lawrence
gold
--my
point
is
that
was
the
only
example
over
raised
in
the
debates,
even
insofar
as
the
debates
talked
about
picketing.
mr.
lawrence
gold
justice
scalia,
i'm
not
arguing
that
they
the
issue
was
either
posed
or
answered
in
those
general
terms.
there
was
a
debate
going
on.
there
had
been
only
one
example
used.
certainly,
the
way
you
are
reading
it
is
the
other
fair
way
of
reading
the
language,
that
there
was
a
different
discussion
than
the
one
i
just
indicated,
namely
a
discussion
which
said
there
are
other
situations
than
the
one
than
president
eisenhower
mentioned
and
those
situations,
we
do
intend
to
prohibit
other
forms
of
communication.
in
other
words,
that
this
really
was
done
with
malice
aforethought
to
narrow
the
provision.
my
point
is
that
there
are
two
ways
of
seeing
it
against
the
background
of
the
overall
debate.
normally,
that
would
not
be
of
any
help
to
someone
attacking
a
board
decision
reading
the
language
the
other
way,
but
we're
not
in
the
normal
situation.
that
is
my
point.
the
presumption
is
that
unless
you
can
show
an
affirmative
indication
of
congress
to
reach
the
activity
in
question,
then
you're
to
read
the
statute
narrowly
to
as
not
to
limit
the
expressive
activity,
and
i
wish
to
conclude
by
saying
not
only
are
there
these
different
ways
of
reading
both
the
general
prohibition
and
the
proviso
against
the
background
of
constitutional
doubts
requires
a
narrow
construction,
i
do
wish
to
point
out
that
when
the
parties
left
the
conference,
the
manager
on
the
house
side
of
the
landry-griffin
bill,
representative
griffin,
and
senator
kennedy
was
the
manager
on
the
senate
side,
went
back
to
their
colleagues
and
explained
what
they
had
done,
the
language--
