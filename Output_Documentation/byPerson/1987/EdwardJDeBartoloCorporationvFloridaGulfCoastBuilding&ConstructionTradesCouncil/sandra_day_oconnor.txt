justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
cohen,
suppose
we
think
the
statute
was
intended
to
reach
this
kind
of
activity,
how
do
you
deal
with
organization
for
a
better
austin,
that
case,
that
says
even
coercive
hand
billing
is
entitled
to
1st
amendment
protection,
and
what
standard
do
we
then
apply?
justice
o'connor
the
language
was
very
broad.
justice
o'connor
and
what
tests
do
we
employ?
do
we
look
for
a
compelling
state
interest
or
what?
justice
o'connor
some
commercial
speech
standard.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think,
mr.
gold,
that
safeco
and
decisions
like
that
rest
at
bottom
on
the
understanding
that
in
the
labor
law
context,
unions
have
been
given
certain
powers
and
corresponding
duties
and
the
same
with
employers
in
that
context
and
that
has
somehow
changed
the
standard
a
little
bit
under
which
we
view
some
of
these
regulations?
how
else
can
you
justify
safeco?
justice
o'connor
mr.
gold,
if
a
standard
approaching
to
used
in
commercial
speech
cases
were
applied
here,
would
your
client
lose?
