mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
in
this
case
are
simple
and
not
in
dispute
high's,
a
building
contractor,
was
engaged
by
wilson's,
a
retailer,
to
build
a
department
store.
the
department
store
was
to
be
located
on
a
shopping
center
owned
by
debartolo.
the
union
had
a
dispute
with
high's
because
it
allegedly
paid
non-union
or
sub-standard
wages.
the
union
did
not
have
a
dispute
with
wilson's.
it
did
not
have
a
dispute
with
debartolo,
and
it
did
not
have
a
dispute
with
any
of
the
tenant
stores,
approximately
eighty-five
tenant
stores,
that
were
located
on
the
shopping
center.
neither
debartolo
nor
the
tenant
stores
had
any
relationship
whatsoever
with
high's.
now,
the
union
had
many
ways
to
express
its
message,
but
it
did
not
its
message
as
to
high's
allegedly
substandard
wages.
it
did
not,
however,
picket
or
place
any
economic
pressure
whatsoever
on
high.
it
did
not
boycott
or
place
any
economic
pressure
on
wilson's.
it
did
not
merely
publicize
to
the
public
the
fact
that
high
paid
sub-standard
wages.
instead,
the
union
took
a
different
lack.
for
three
weeks
during
the
christmas
season,
busiest
time
of
the
year,
the
union
placed
hand
billers
at
all
the
entrances
to
the
interior
mall
of
the
shopping
center
and
urged
a
total
consumer
boycott
of
all
the
tenants
of
the
shopping
center.
it
only
stopped
when
it
was
enjoined
after
the
florida
courts
found
irrevocable
injury.
in
1983,
this
court
heard
the
case
and
unanimously
concluded
that
the
hand
billing
was
not
protected
by
the
publicity
proviso
of
section
8(b)(4)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
that
the
required
producer-distributor
relationship
of
that
section
had
not
been
met.
the
proviso,
the
court
indicated,
was
not
intended
to
preclude
all
types
of
peaceful,
truthful
hand
billing,
only
hand
billing
that
met
the
terms
of
the
proviso,
the
three
terms
of
the
proviso
was
to
be
protected.
the
case
was
then
remanded.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
for
two
reasons.
it
was
remanded
to
determine
if
there
was
coercion
within
the
meaning
of
section
8(b)(4).
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
correct,
and,
if
so,
whether
it
was
protected
by
the
1st
amendment.
the
labor
board
first,
there
was
no
dispute,
of
course,
that
the
union's
objective
was
forbidden
and
that
those
tenants
were
neutral
employers.
the
only
question,
of
course,
was
whether
there
was
coercion.
the
board
found
there
was
coercion
because
the
purpose
of
the
union
hand
billing
was
to
impose
substantial
economic
harm
on
the
tenant
stores,
and
it
concluded
that
was
not
unconstitutional.
the
11th
circuit,
however,
refused
to
enforce
the
board's
order.
it
held
that
only
picketing
focused
exclusively
on
the
form
of
the
union's
conduct.
it
held
that
only
picketing
could
be
coercive
within
the
meaning
of
section
8(b)(4),
and
that
every
other
form,
hand
billing
or
any
other
form
of
publicity,
would
not
be
in
any
way
coercive
or
prohibited
by
section
8(b)(4).
the
decision,
we
submit,
is
contrary
to
the
specific
language
of
the
act
itself.
the
act
itself
does
not
only
talk
about
hand
billing
i
mean,
about
picketing,
the
act
talks
about
any
action
that
threatens,
coerces
or
restrains
a
neutral
employer.
a
threat,
for
example,
to
engage
in
conduct
to
shut
down
the
business
of
a
secondary
or
to
impose
substantial
economic
harm
on
them,
however
that
threat
is
communicated,
would
be
prohibited
by
the
act.
similarly,
coercion,
as
this
court
indicated
in
tree
fruits,
whether
by
picketing
or
otherwise,
is
forbidden
by
section
8(b)(4),
and
coercion,
as
this
court
has
defined
it
in
both
safeco
and
allied
international,
is
any
conduct
which
predictably
encourages
customers
to
boycott
a
secondary
business
or
which
reasonably
can
be
expected
to
threaten
neutral
employers
with
ruin
or
substantial
loss.
that's
certainly
what
happened
here,
and
that's
what
the
board
found.
the
only
type
of
coercive
conduct
that's
exempted
from
the
statute
is
that
which
meets
the
three
specific
terms
of
the
proviso;
it
has
to
be
truthful,
it
has
to
involve
a
producer-distributor
relationship,
and
it
cannot
induce
a
work
stoppage.
if
it
doesn't
meet
the
terms
of
the
proviso,
then
it
is
coercive
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
prohibited
by
the
act.
the
union
here
did
not,
let
me
repeat,
did
not
just
try
and
express
its
message.
that,
it
was
permitted
to
do.
it
could
have
said
in
any
way
it
wanted
to
that
high
did
not
pay
sub-standard
wages.
what
it
did
impermissibly
here
was
go
a
step
further
and
add
to
that
message
the
fact
of
trying
to
impose
pressure,
economic
pressure,
on
the
neutral
tenant
stores.
that's
where
the
union
violated
the
act.
prior
to
the
decision
in
this
case,
that's
been
the
decision
of
not
only
all
the
lower
courts
and
the
labor
board
itself
consistently
from
the
thirty
years
since
those
amendments
to
the
statute
were
passed.
the
court
below
disregarded
that
history
and
it
disregarded
that
language.
its
read
of
the
publicity
proviso,
as
the
7th
circuit
said
in
boxhorn,
as
simply
so
much
blab.
the
publicity
proviso
served
no
useful
purpose.
it
was
a
pointless
gesture.
it
was
a
mere
collection
of
idle
words
because
if
the
publicity
proviso,
as
the
union
now
argues,
was
only
a
clarification
point.
the
statute
never
covered
anything
but
picketing
to
begin
with
and
the
proviso
only
applies
to
non-picketing
publicity.
that
is,
we
submit,
the
vice
here.
it's
not
a
the
union
position
is
not
one
that
is
supported
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
when
the
act
was
passed,
the
purpose
was
to
prevent
direct
coercion
of
secondary
employers.
that's
what
this
court
indicated
in
tree
fruits.
now,
there
were
differences,
of
course,
as
between
the
house
and
the
senate
as
to
how
you
could
prevent
direct
coercion
of
secondary
employers.
the
house
said,
we
think
it
ought
to
be
prohibited,
as
they
explained
in
the
joint
analysis,
by
any
conduct,
whether
it
be
picketing,
leafleting,
radio
broadcasts,
advertisements,
any
of
that
conduct
would
have
been
prohibited
by
the
house.
the
senate
did
not
agree.
the
senate
had
no
restrictions
on
secondary
consumer
boycotts.
as
a
result,
there
was
a
compromise,
and
that
compromise
is
embodied
in
the
publicity
proviso
to
the
act.
some
non-consumer
some
non-picketing
consumer
boycotts
are
allowed,
but
only
those
that
meet
the
three
terms
of
the
proviso.
other
non-picketing
publicity,
if
it's
coercive
and
it's
not
protected
by
the
proviso,
is
forbidden.
it
doesn't
matter
on
how
the
union
does
it,
whether
it's
doing
by
picketing,
hand
billing,
leafleting.
the
only
question
is
whether
it
has
complied
with
the
terms
of
the
proviso.
if
it
has,
then
it
can
make
its
appeal,
even
if
it's
coercive.
if
it
hasn't,
it
can't.
that's
the
parameters
of
the
conflict--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--if
the
intention
is
to
cause
substantial
harm
to
the
secondary--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
it
has
a
trivial
effect
for
example,
if
it's
an
advertisement
placed
in
some
distant
location
that's--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--in
our
opinion,
yes,
because
that
predictably
encourages
a
secondary
boycott,
and
that's
the
test
of
coercion
as
this
court
has
set
it
in
safeco
and
allied.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
question
would
come
up
at
the
outset
of
the
hand
billing.
if
the
labor
board
could
conclude,
and
the
labor
board,
of
course,
is
the
expert
tribunal,
conclude
that
what
the
union
is
doing
has
the
foreseeable
consequences
of
causing
loss
of
business
to
the
secondary,
if
that's
a
foreseeable
consequence,
if
that's
the
likelihood,
and
that
was
proven
at
the
course
of
the
hearing,
an
injunction
or
unfair
labor
practice,
then
that
would
be
a
coercive
conduct
and
forbidden.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
union
could
come
in
and
say,
well,
no
one
paid
attention,
it
wasn't
effective,
it
didn't
have
those
foreseeable
consequences,
then,
of
course,
that
would
be
counter-evidence
the
labor
board
would
have
to
assess.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
finding
of
the
board
was
that
the
union's
conduct
would
cause
substantial
loss
to
secondary
employers.
secondary
employers
being
the
neutral
tenant
stores
and,
by
process,
then,
of
course,
also
debartolo.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
difference
is
this
case
arises
under
the
labor
act,
where
you
have
a
delicate
balance,
to
use
justice
blackmun's
phrase,
between
the
public
interests,
public
interests
in
precluding
this
threat
of
labor
discord
on
one
side,
public
interest,
as
opposed
to
the
interest
in
communicating
the
message.
in
better
austin,
the
opposite
was
not
a
public
interest,
it
was
a
private
interest
of
an
individual
business
man
to
be
free
from
embarrassment
and
ridicule.
secondly,
in
austin,
what
you
see--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--that's
correct,
but
it
wasn't
done
by
a
labor
organization
which,
here,
has
many
ways
to
express
its
message.
the
union
here
was
entitled
to
go
out
and
communicate
its
message
that
high
did
not
pay
sub-standard
wages.
it
could
communicate
that
coercively,
if
it
wanted
to,
by
picketing
high
or
boycotting
wilson's.
in
citizens
for
better
austin,
there
was
a
blanket
injunction
which
prohibited
anyway
of
communicating
that
message
throughout
the
whole
town
that
was
involved
where
the
real
estate
broker
had
his
residence.
it
was
a
blanket
injunction
that
precluded
any
spread
of
the
message.
it
was
a
situation
where
the
only
counter-balance
to
communicating
the
message
was
a
private
message
on
the
part
of
the
broker
as
opposed
to
the
public
interests
we
have
here,
which
is
the
public
interest
of
section
8(b)(4),
which
is
not
to
enmesh
neutral
employers
in
labor
disputes
of
others.
that's
the
counter-balance
here.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
we
look
to
the
test
of
whether
we're
regulating
this
type
of
conduct,
is
there
a
strong
government
interest,
does
the
statute
directly
advance
that
strong
government
interest,
and
does
it
advance
it
no
further
than
necessary--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--it's
akin
to
the
commercial
speech.
that's
correct.
it's
analogous
to
the
commercial
speech
cases.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it's
a
standard
that
was
applied
in
safeco,
we
believe,
and
it's
the
standard
that
was
applied
in
allied,
which
was
not
a
picketing
case.
allied
international.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
in
safeco,
there
were
six
members
of
the
court
that
reached
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
and
found
that
that
was
constitutional.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
there
were
three
dissents
who
did
not
reach
that
question
because
they
found
it
was
not
covered
by
the
statutes.
the
key
in
the
constitutional
argument
in
our
point,
in
our
opinion,
is
that
since
at
least
1940,
this
court
has
said
that
congress
can
set
the
permissible
contact,
the
limits
of
permissible
contact,
that's
open
to
industrial
combatants.
where
conduct
is
designed
not
to
coerce
and
not
to
communicate,
that
has
always
been
held
to
be
consistently
conduct
which
this
court
can
regulate
which
the
government
can
regulate
consistent
with
the
1st
amendment.
in
safeco,
the
situation
was
precisely
that
we
have
here.
the
union
was
attempting
to
communicate
to
consumers
a
message,
don't
shop
or
don't
do
business
with
the
particular
employer.
the
only
difference
between
the
two
cases
is
that
case
involved
communication
by
picketing,
this
case
involves
communication
by
hand
billing.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
unless
the
court
has
additional
questions
of
me,
i
think
this
is
probably
an
appropriate
time
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
and
turn
it
over
to
the
government.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
let
me
be
clear
at
the
outset
exactly
what
it
is
the
message
that's
being
limited
in
this
case.
the
union
is
not
being
limited
in
articulating
the
facts
of
its
dispute
with
high.
it's
not
being
limited
in
any
way
from
asking
for
customers
or
the
public
to
aid
it
in
its
dispute
with
high.
the
only
message
that
is
being
limited
is
a
message
that
says
injure
neutral
parties
who
have
no
connection
whatsoever
with
this
dispute.
don't
shop
at
the
center.
that's
the
only
message
that's
limited,
and
that
type
of
message
being
limited
is
similar
to
acts
of
limitation
in
the
labor
context
and
in
many
other
ways.
for
example,
an
employer,
although
he
may
have
a
free
speech
right
in
other
contexts
to
make
predictions
about
unionization,
can't
under
gissel
say
to
his
employees,
i
think
if
you
vote
for
a
union,
you're
going
to
have
to
close
this
plant.
that
would
be
impermissible.
and
that's
the
same
type
of
restriction
which
other
members
of
the
public,
other
community
organizations,
other
people
unconnected
with
that
labor
campaign,
are
perfectly
free
to
make.
so,
there
is
a
difference
that
this
comes
up
in
the
context
of
a
labor
dispute,
because
the
labor
act
sets
the
permissible
limitations
of
the
combatants
in
that
labor
dispute,
and
it
tells
the
union,
you
can
predict
and
you
can
indicate
the
facts
of
the
case--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--i
would
say--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--if
the
foreseeable
consequences
of
that
advertisement--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--then,
it
would
be
impermissible.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
because
what's
impermissible
is
not
to
say
we
have
a
dispute
with
high
or
high
pays
sub-standard
wages.
that's
never
been
held
impermissible.
what's
impermissible
is
that
they
add
to
that
the
fact,
don't
shop
at
the
center.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
because
however
they
communicated
it,
if
that's--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--that's
correct.
what's
significant
is
whether
the
union
effectively
put
pressure
on
a
neutral
party
to
the
dispute,
whether
it
enlarged
the
labor
dispute,
whether
it
widened
industrial
strike.
i
think
that's
illustrated
by
safeco
because
the
only
difference
between
safeco
and
this
case
is
picketing.
safeco
tried
went
to
neutral
customers
and
it
said
please
don't
shop
here.
they
were
not
coerced.
they
had
free
reason
of
choice.
the
only
difference
was
that
they,
instead
of
handing
out
a
hand
bill
that
said
that,
they
carried
a
picket
sign
that
said
it
or
wore
a
placard.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--let
me
indicate
that
in
many
contexts,
it
may
be.
if
you're
talking
about
a
manufacturing
plant
and
the
union
puts
up
a
picket
sign,
teamster
drivers
coming
into
that
plant
see
the
sign,
whether
it's
stuck
in
a
snow
bank
or
it's
on
a
car,
and
they
turn
away.
it's
union
discipline.
that's
a
signal
effect.
but
in
the
case
of
consumer
picketing,
as
occurred
in
safeco,
and
consumer
hand
billing
here,
there
is
no
difference.
they're
not
relying
on
the
fact
that
union
discipline
is
going
to
turn
people
away.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
there
are
going
here,
if
they
make
a
choice
of
not
shopping
at
the
center,
whether
it's
because
of
the
picket
sign
or
hand
billing,
they
are
going
to
do
it
not
because
they're
fearful
of
union
discipline,
they're
going
to
do
it
because
they
have
made
a
reasoned
decision
and
that
reasoned
it's
not
if
a
customer,
whether
he's
a
union
member
or
whatever
beliefs,
decides
i
don't
want
to
shop
at
east
lake
square
mall,
it's
not
because,
as
he
would
in
a
single
picketing
case,
he's
fearful
that
the
union
is
going
to
discipline
him
if
he
does
anything.
the
union
doesn't
know
who's
shopping
at
the
center.
people
are
going
to
go
in
and
shop
at
the
center
either
because
they
disagree
with
the
union
or
they're
going
to
refuse
to
shop
because
they
agree
with
the
union,
and
how
that
message
is
communicated
to
them,
whether
it's
by
a
picket
sign,
a
sound
truck,
an
advertisement,
or
a
hand
bill,
is
immaterial.
the
effect
in
each
case
is
harm
the
neutral,
and
embroil
the
neutral
in
the
dispute,
and
that's
what
section
8(b)(4)
was
designed
to
preclude.
whether
not
how
the
union
did
it,
but
what
the
union
was
intending
to
do.
this
is
the
purpose
and
that
purpose
is
equally
communicated
by
an
individual
standing
up
in
front
of
the
shopping
center
holding
a
sign
or
wearing
a
placard
that
says
please
don't
shop
here
or
somebody
handing
out
a
hand
bill
which
individuals
can
read
and
decipher
and
think
about
and
then
go
ahead
and
go
in.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
picketing
and
hand
billing,
and
the
important
point
is
that
that's
what
congress
forbid.
when
it
came
out
of
the
conference
committee,
and
there
was
a
publicity
proviso,
congress
said
you
can
only
engage
in
picketing
and
publicity
other
than
picketing
if
you
meet
these
three
conditions,
and
the
only
way
mr.
gold's
other
argument
is
fairly
possible,
which
is
the
standard
of
catholic
bishop,
is
if
you
disregard
the
expressed
language
of
the
proviso
and
simply
dismiss
it
as
so
much
legislative
blab,
and
that's
what
i
think
the
court
should
not
do.
it
should
pay
attention
to
the
language.
it
should
limit
non-publicity
picketing
in
only
those
cases
which
don't
meet
the
proviso.
thank
you.
