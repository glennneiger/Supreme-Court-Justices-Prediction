justice
stevens
mr.
cohen,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
assume
that
the
union
wanted
to
disseminate
precisely
the
same
message
by
using
some
trucks
and
outside
the
shopping
center,
maybe
radio
ads
or
newspaper
ads,
which
would,
of
course,
not
be
picketing,
would
that
have
been
prohibited
by
the
statute?
justice
stevens
well,
it's
the
same
intention
here.
justice
stevens
that's
precisely
the
same
because
they
don't
want
people
to
be
going
to
the
shopping
center
and
buy
in
these
stores
until
high
gets
its
wages
up.
well,
it
still
has
to
be
objectively
coercive.
justice
stevens
no,
no.
i'm
assuming
the
audience
is
the
same.
it's
beamed
at
the
people
who
regularly
shop
there
by
sound
or
something,
but
it's
not
right
on
the
at
the
that
still
would
be
coercion.
justice
stevens
would
it
matter
in
this
case
if
nobody
ever
paid
any
attention
to
the
hand
billing?
justice
stevens
were
there--
justice
stevens
--were
there
findings
in
this
case
as
to
what
the
consequences
of
the
hand
billing
were?
justice
stevens
mr.
cohen,
i
asked
your
petitioner's
counsel
whether
the
issue
would
be
the
same
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
if
the
communication
was
in
a
different
form,
say
a
radio
or
sound
truck
or
something
like
that,
and
he
said
it
would
be
the
same
statutory
issue.
do
you
agree
it
would
be
the
same
constitutional
issue,
that
it
would
still
violate
the
command
of
congress
and
it's
still
equally
coercive
if
it
is
not
at
the
front
of
the
door
but,
rather,
at
the
front
of
the
shopping
mall,
as
i
say,
by
sound
rather
than
by
hand
billing
or
a
newspaper
ad,
something
like
that?
justice
stevens
so,
you
would
say
it's
correct
to
judge
this
case
as
really
a
pure
speech
case
in
which
the
prohibition
is
justified
entirely
on
the
basis
of
the
message
and
the
audience
that's
involved?
justice
stevens
and
you
say
it's
proper
for
us
to
judge
the
case,
even
though
there's
absolutely
no
element
of
physical
concern
by
the
people
receiving
the
hand
billing?
it
isn't
that
there
are
very
large
individuals
who
strike
fear
into
the
heart
of
those.
if
that
isn't
involve,
it
would
be
just
the
same
as
if
it
were
very
small
harmless-looking
people
doing
it?
