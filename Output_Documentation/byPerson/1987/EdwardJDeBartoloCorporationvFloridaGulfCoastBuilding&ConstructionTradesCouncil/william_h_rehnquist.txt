mr.
cohen,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00,
mr.
cohen.
mr.
cohen,
you
may
resume
your
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
louis
cohen,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
how
does
that
coerce
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word,
other
than
by
the
persuasive
power
of
the
idea?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
even
though
the
message
to
the
shoppers
from
the
hand
bills
is
not
coercive,
the
result
on
the
neutral
stores
could
be
coercive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
homer
nodded.
okay.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
gibboney
involve
picketing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
lawrence
cohen,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
is
a
distinction
under
our
constitutional
cases.
chief
justice
rehnquist
picketing
is
always
thought
to
be
speech
plus
or
something
more.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there
are
non-union
members
who
won't
cross
a
picket
line.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
87-65,
united
states
against
providence
journal
company.
