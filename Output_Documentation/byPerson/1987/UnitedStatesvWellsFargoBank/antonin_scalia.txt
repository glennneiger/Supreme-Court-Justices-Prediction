justice
scalia
but
you
just
told
us
that
this
wasn't
an
exception,
that
the
language
simply
didn't
cover
it.
justice
scalia
that
is
a
true
exception,
but
you
just
told
us
that
the
exemption
of
any
transfer
taxes--
justice
scalia
--is
not
really
an
exemption.
justice
scalia
you
are
combining
two
of
the
government's
arguments.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
want
a
plain
language
argument,
you
just
look
to
the
first
provision,
not
the
later
one
that
contains
the
exceptions,
and
the
plain
language
of
that,
it
seems
to
me,
does
not
cover
these
bonds.
justice
scalia
you
may
call
it
a
formalistic
distinction,
but
the
fact
is
when
you
tax
the
bonds,
you're
imposing
an
annual
tax
or
some
other
tax
on
the
bonds
themselves.
this
estate
tax
does
not
apply
until...
unless
and
until
there's
a
transfer.
so,
it's
really
a
tax
on
the
transfer.
you
may
call
that
formalistic,
but
that's
plain
language.
justice
scalia
in
light
of
20(b).
