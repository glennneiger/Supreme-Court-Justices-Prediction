rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
tax
court
held
that
the
bonds
were
not
intended
to
be
exempt
under
the
1937
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
maybe
he's
responsible
for
getting
estate
tax
exemptions
for
the
bond.
well,
he
was
not
a
leader
in
the
tax
area
in
congress
anyway
at
the
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
rotstein.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
an
estate
tax
report,
mr.
rotstein,
if
something
is
exempt
from
the
estate
tax,
do
you
not
even
have
to
list
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
couldn't
a
taxpayer
simply
list
or
include
it,
but
say
it's
not
taxable,
which
would
not
allow
him
to
take
a
forward
position
but
still
not
risk
evasion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
either
of
these
cases,
did
the
decedents
claim
exemption
for
the
notes?
did
they
in
their
estate
tax
return?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
mr.
rotstein,
certainly
congress
made
a
stab
at
satisfying
decedent's
legitimate
expectation.
people
who
claim
them
as
exempt
were
not
subject
to
the
'84
and
people
who
didn't
were.
that
seems
to
me
quite
a
sensitive
adjustment
for
expectations.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
sort
of
compulsion
is
a
revenue
ruling?
i
mean,
may
not
an
executor
do
anything
but
follow
a
revenue
ruling?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
did
the
haffner
people
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rotstein.
mr.
wallace,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
if
you'd
stand
there
for
just
a
minute,
our
records
show
that
this
is
your
hundredth
appearance
before
this
court,
and
that
your
first
argument
here
was
in
a
case
argued
march
25th,
1968,
for
the
government.
on
behalf
of
the
court,
we'd
like
to
extend
to
you
our
thanks
for
your
able
advocacy
during
this
period
of
time.
the
case
is
submitted.
