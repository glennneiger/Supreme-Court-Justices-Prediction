justice
blackmun
mr.
wallace,
the
present
case
came
up
from
the
tax
court,
too,
didn't
it?
justice
blackmun
from
the
district
court.
justice
blackmun
and
haffner
came
out
of
the
northern
district
of
illinois?
justice
blackmun
is
this
the
first
time
the
issue
was
reviewed
by
the
tax
court,
by
the
full
tax
court?
justice
blackmun
the
first
time?
justice
blackmun
and
you
have
five
dissents
or
something
like
that?
justice
blackmun
then,
mr.
wallace,
why
would
there
be
specific
exemption
language
in
section
20
of
the
earlier
act?
justice
blackmun
mr.
wallace,
which
senator
walsh
was
this?
massachusetts
or
montana?
justice
blackmun
aren't
you
taking
almost
a
criminal
risk
if
you
don't
list
something
that
might
be
taxable?
you
don't
have
to
include
it,
but
certainly
a
conservative
approach
would
be
to
recite
its
presence
and
take
a
position
that
it's
not
includable.
justice
blackmun
that
may
not
only
be
conservative.
it
may
be
the
wise
counselling.
justice
blackmun
this
is
the
get-by
doctrine,
in
other
words?
i've
heard
tax
attorneys
use
that.
justice
blackmun
yes.
justice
blackmun
do
you
practice
tax
law
exclusively?
justice
blackmun
but
you
do
some
of
it
anyway?
justice
blackmun
because
surely
if
you
were
in
tax
law
constantly,
you
would
do
just
that,
take
the
prudent
reference
of
non-includability,
but
at
least
of
indicating
presence,
so
that
there's
no
question
of
a
fraud
tack
for
an
attempt
to
evade
tax.
justice
blackmun
how
long
before
his
death?
justice
blackmun
all
of
them
purchased
within
a
year
then?
justice
blackmun
was
dr.
stein
in
good
health
when
these
notes
were
purchased?
justice
blackmun
one
could
almost
say
it
was
a
purchase,
not
a
transfer,
a
purchase
in
contemplation
of
death
otherwise.
justice
blackmun
in
the
companion
case,
do
you
know
how
long
before
death
the
project
notes
were
purchased?
justice
blackmun
do
you
know
how
the
internal
revenue
service
discovered
their
existence?
in
the
probate
files
or
something?
justice
blackmun
in
your
case,
that's
correct.
justice
blackmun
i
take
the
wells
fargo
executors
then
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
rev
rule?
justice
blackmun
that's
a
pretty
low
form
of
animal
life
in
the
structure
of
treasury
rulings
of
one
kind
or
another,
about
the
lowest
there
is
almost,
and
you
feel
they
worked
under
compulsion.
