mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
appellees
are
executors
of
estates
that
included
among
their
property
state
or
local
public
housing
agency
project
notes.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
testamentary
transfer
of
those
project
notes
is
exempt
from
the
federal
estate
tax.
in
urging
that
the
testamentary
transfer
is
not
exempt,
we
have
two
grounds,
either
of
which
would
independently
support
a
judgment
in
our
favor.
our
principal
contention
is
that
the
transfer
of
such
notes
never
was
exempted
from
the
federal
estate
tax
by
the
federal
housing
act
of
1937,
the
so-called
wagner
act.
our
other
contention
is
that
even
if
they
had
been
so
exempted,
congress
repealed
that
exemption
in
1984
for
taxpayers
situated
such
as
the
appellees,
and
that
contrary
to
the
district
court's
holding,
the
application
of
that
repealer
provision
was
not
unconstitutional.
there
are
three
reasons
why
we
urge
that
the
court
should
address
our
principal
contention
first,
that
the
transfer
never
was
exempt
from
federal
estate
tax.
the
first
is
that
if
we
are
correct
about
this
statutory
issue,
it
avoids
the
necessity
of
addressing
a
constitutional
contention
or
even
the
necessity
of
construing
the
effect
of
the
1984
repealer
provision
in
light
of
the
constitutional
argument.
the
second
reason
why
we
believe
that
question
should
be
addressed
first
is
that
there
are
presently
pending,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
done
a
survey
on
this,
101
cases
which
would
not
be
disposed
of
were
the
decision
to
rest
on
grounds
of
the
scope
or
constitutionality
of
the
1984
repealer
provision
because
there
were
101
cases
pending,
either
administratively
or
in
the
courts,
with
a
total
value
of
project
notes
at
issue
of
slightly
more
than
$90
million,
in
which
the
returns
were
filed
after
the
haffner
decision
came
down
in
1984,
and
no
tax
was
reported
as
owing
on
these
returns.
they
are
cases
that
would
be
controlled
by
whether
or
not
haffner
was
correctly
decided,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
was
the
7th
circuit
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
did
not
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
for
haffner.
we
had
no
conflict
in
the
circuits
at
that
time,
and
congress
had
already
enacted
a
retroactive
repealer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so,
we--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
didn't
think
that
our
future
course
here
would
be
enhanced
by
tacking
certiorari
denied
on
to
the
7th
circuit's
decision.
so,
we
did
not
petition
there.
now,
this
is
not
in
our
judgment
an
issue
that
should
have
to
be
briefed
and
argued
twice
in
this
court
and,
therefore,
there
is
some
merit
in
deciding
the
issue
that
would
dispose
of
all
or
the
cases.
first,
now
it
is
true
that
we
do
not
presently
have
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
on
that
narrow
question,
but
we
do
believe
that
the
impetus
of
decisions
has
turned
in
our
favor
with
this
recent
decision
of
the
tax
court
by
an
eleven
to
five
vote
called
estate
of
egger,
which
is
referred
to
in
our
reply
brief,
and
which
we
have
furnished
for
the
court's
convenience.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
present
case
is
from
a
district
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
on
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
the
first
tax
court
decision
on
the
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
were
five
dissents,
but
eleven
votes
agreeing
with
our
position,
and
i
would
add
that
the
tax
court's
opinion
seems
to
us
to
be
the
fullest
and
most
persuasive
treatment
of
the
issue
thus
far
by
any
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
1937
act,
which
was
the
only
issue
before
the
tax
court
since
the
repealer
provision,
would
not
have
affected
the
tax
court
cases.
now,
the
third
reason
why
we
think
that
the
court
should
first
consider
that
question
is
because
we
think
it
is
the
correct
answer
that
congress
never
did
have
to
retroactively
repeal
an
exemption
that
never
existed,
and
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
that's
what
congress
itself
thought
when
it
enacted
the
repealer
provision
less
than
three
months
after
the
district
court
decision
in
haffner
without
even
waiting
to
see
whether
the
court
of
appeals
would
affirm
or
reverse
the
district
court.
now,
on
this
issue,
the
district
court
in
our
case
simply
relied
on
the
district
court
decision
in
haffner.
so,
we'll
turn
to
the
analysis
used
by
the
district
court
in
haffner.
that
decision
surely
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable,
is
one
of
the
most
remarked-upon
tax
decisions
of
our
time,
in
that
it
discovered
a
tax
exemption
that
had
lain
dormant
for
almost
forty-five
years,
a
tax
exemption
of
very
elastic
scope
which
had
gone
unnoticed
by
the
tax
bar,
unclaimed
by
taxpayers,
and
unrecognized
by
either
the
internal
revenue
service
or
any
court
for
a
period
of
almost
forty-five
years,
and
the
court
did
so
while
conceding
in
its
opinion
that
the
language
used
by
congress
in
the
1937
act
would
not
in
itself
be
sufficient
to
confer
this
exemption.
that
language
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on
pages
2a
and
3a
at
the
very
end
of
our
brief.
it's
section
5(e),
which
provides
in
the
second
sentence
that
obligations
issued
by
these
local
public
housing
authorities
and
then
skipping
to
the
end
of
the
paragraph
"shall
be
exempt
from
all
taxation
now
or
hereafter
imposed
by
the
united
states.
"
as
the
tax
court
recently
said
in
estate
of
egger,
that
language
had
been
definitively
interpreted
by
this
court
as
well
as
other
courts
by
1937,
at
the
time
the
wagner
housing
act
was
enacted,
and
it
had
been
definitively
interpreted
to
apply
to
taxes
on
the
obligations
or
the
income
themselves,
income
or
property
taxes,
and
not
to
taxes
on
the
transfer
of
the
securities,
namely
estate
or
gift
taxes.
the
interpretation
of
such
statutory
provisions,
and
we
have
collected
the
cases
on
pages
18
and
19
of
our
brief,
in
a
lengthy
footnote
as
well
as
in
the
text,
the
interpretation
was
closely
tied
in
to
the
constitutional
question
of
the
validity
of
the
estate
and
gift
tax
in
light
of
the
requirement
of
article
i,
section
ix
of
the
constitution,
that
direct
taxes
must
be
apportioned
among
the
states,
and
the
reason
why
nothing
comparable
to
the
sixteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
authorizing
the
income
tax
had
to
be
adopted
for
purposes
of
the
estate
and
gift
tax
is
because
the
court
in
the
cases
we
cite
had
definitely
held
that
the
estate
and
gift
taxes
are
not
taxes
on
the
obligations,
but
are
taxes
on
the
act
of
transfer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
brings
me,
mr.
justice,
to
the
first
ground
relied
upon,
we
think
erroneously,
by
the
court
in
haffner,
the
difference
in
the
drafting
between
this
language
we
just
looked
at
in
section
5
and
the
language
that
appears
on
the
next
page,
which
is
section
20(b)
of
the
1937
act,
a
provision
which
has
not
existed
in
the
act
since
1949,
and
that
is
referring
to
obligations
of
the
federal
housing
authority,
a
federal
agency,
which
was
to
furnish
money
to
the
state
agencies.
it
says
that
though
it
shall
be
exempt,
both
as
to
principal
and
interest,
from
all
taxation,
except
sur
taxes,
estate,
inheritance
and
gift
taxes,
now
or
hereafter
imposed
by
the
united
states
or
any
state
or
local
taxing
authority.
the
principal
difference,
and
we
think
the
basis
of
the
error
in
the
haffner
case,
is
that
looked
upon
in
historical
context,
this
was
a
much
more
limited
exemption
from
income
taxation.
from
1913
until
1954,
the
income
tax
was
really
divided
into
two
taxes;
what
was
basically
the
flat
rate
at
a
rather
low
level
income
tax,
and
the
graduated
aspect
of
it,
called
the
sur
tax,
and
the
taxable
income
was
defined
slightly
differently.
the
determination
was
made
with
respect
to
the
federal
obligations
that
they,
unlike
the
obligations
of
the
local
housing
authorities,
would
be
exempted
from
the
flat
tax
which,
in
1937,
was
a
four
percent
tax,
but
they
would
not
be
exempted
from
the
graduated
aspect
of
the
income
tax.
the
sur
tax.
and,
therefore,
it
was
necessary
in
drafting
this
provision
to
put
in
an
exception
to
accomplish
the
result
congress
wanted
to
accomplish,
to
say
except
sur
taxes.
once
an
exception
was
mentioned,
then
cautious
draftsmanship
would
call
for
enumerating
all
the
exceptions
to
ward
off
the
possibility
of
an
argument
that
expressio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius,
as
it's
sometimes
called.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
language
would
have
covered
sur
taxes.
so,
it
was
necessary
to
have
an
exception
for
sur
taxes.
this
could
be--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
might
not
have
been
necessary,
but
it
was
a
draftsmanship
devise
used
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
and
it
was
not
something
peculiar
to
this
statute.
we
have
on
page
29
of
our
brief
collected
a
number
of
references
to
other
federal
statutes.
this
was
the
standard
mode
of
including
exemption
from
taxation
for
federal
obligations,
whereas
5e
reflected
the
standard
mode
that
was
used
in
formulating
an-exemption
from
state
obligations
which
was
a
broader
exemption.
we
have
in
the
footnote
on
page
29
and
in
the
related
text,
a
number
of
other
examples
that
use
the
same
standard
mode.
the
other
point
to
be
kept
in
mind
is
that
these
two
provisions
were
not
drafted
simultaneously.
section
20(b)
was
carried
over
from
a
bill
that
was
first
drafted
in
1935.
it
was
carried
over
to
another
one
in
'36,
and
then
finally
to
this
one
in
'37,
whereas
section
5e
was
drafted
in
1937,
almost
surely
by
different
people.
so
that
it
is
as
we
term
in
our
reply
brief,
fallacious
to
compare
the
two
as
if
they
were
intentionally
drafted
by
the
same
person
to
accomplish
two
different
results.
instead,
they
are
reach
a
standard
form
of
accomplishing
what
was
an
established
result
at
the
time.
i'd
like
to
turn
next
to
the
remaining
items
in
the
legislative
history
that
are
relied
upon
either
in
the
haffner
opinion
or
in
our
opponent's
briefs
in
this
court.
keeping
in
mind,
however,
that
relying
on
these
matters,
none
of
which
is
unequivocal
as
we
shall
see,
is
really
contrary
to
the
established
principle
stated
over
and
over
again
by
this
court,
that
tax
exemptions
do
not
rest
upon
implication.
they
have
to
be
unequivocally
stated
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
so,
the
entire
inquiry
that
was
undertaken
in
haffner
once
the
court
admitted
that
the
language
used
by
congress
would
not
support
the
exemption
was
really
contrary
to
this
court's
decision.
the
first
thing
relied
upon
was
a
statement
made
on
the
floor
by
senator
walsh
in
the
course
of
a
lengthy
statement
interrupted
by
many
colloquies,
many
of
which
consisted
of
corrections
of
things
that
senator
walsh
had
been
saying,
and
the
particular
paragraph
from
the
congressional
record,
i'd
like
to
read
it
in
full,
so
the
court
will
get
the
flavor
of
it,
was
as
follows:
"obligations,
including
interest
thereon,
issued
by
public
housing
agencies
and
income
derived
by
such
agencies
on
such
projects
are
to
be
exempt
from
all
taxation
now
or
hereafter
imposed
by
the
united
states.
"
"in
other
words,
the
bill
gives
the
public
housing
agencies
the
right
to
issue
tax-exempt
bonds,
which
means
they
are
free
from
income
tax,
sur
tax,
estate,
gift
and
inheritance
taxes.
"
it
is
that
appositional
clause
which
means,
which
is
the
basis
on
which
the
appellees
and
the
court
in
haffner
relied
on,
senator
walsh's
statement.
our
view
is
that
this
is
simply
a
mis-description
of
what
the
meaning
is
for
a
bond
to
be
exempt
from
all
taxation.
what
it
means
to
issue
a
tax-exempt
bond
that
had
been
clearly
established
in
the
court's
cases,
and
it
was
stated
in
a
way
that
suggested
that
this
would
be
the
ordinary
tax-exempt
bonds,
such
as
municipal
bonds,
which
have
never
been
exempt
from
estate
and
gift
taxes,
and
he
was
merely
parathetically
describing
the
attributes
of
a
tax-exempt
bond.
this
is
not
the
way
that
the
congress
unequivocally
would
adopt
so
pronounced
a
change
from
the
ordinary
way
of
doing
business
in
conferring
tax
exemptions
on
municipal
and
other
local
bonds.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
was
montana.
the
massachusetts.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
confused
by
it.
david
walsh
of
massachusetts.
i
thought
he
was
the
other
one.
there
is
some
confusion
about
what
his
precise
role
was
with
respect
to
the
bill.
i
think
ultimately
that's
immaterial.
he
was
not
either
the
sponsor,
who
was
senator
wagner,
the
sponsor
or
floor
manager,
nor
was
he
the
chairman
of
the
committee
during
the
time
that
the
hearings
and
work
were
done
on
the
bill.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
mr.
justice.
but
the
point
is
that
congress,
surely
the
members
of
congress,
would
have
been
alerted
in
a
more
telling
way
than
this
if
a
departure
were
intended
from
the
ordinary
principles
governing
the
scope
of
tax
exemptions.
after
all,
the
house
of
representatives
did
not
even
have
the
benefit
of
senator
walsh's
mis-description
in
the
course
of
his
statement
at
all,
and
there
was
no
indication
that
it
came
across
to
the
members
who
were
hearing
it,
anything
more
than
the
notion
that
the
ordinary
attributes
of
tax-exempt
bonds
were
being
conferred
here.
some
question
is
raised
about
why
no
one
rose
to
correct
this
when
other
corrections
had
been
made
of
other
errors
in
senator
walsh's
statement.
well,
this
is
quite
understandable
when
you
look
at
the
context
in
the
congressional
record.
as
he
finished
there,
he
yielded
to
senator
davis
of
pennsylvania,
who
raised
another
point
with
respect
to
his
statement.
as
i
understand
it,
senator
davis
said
the
local
authorities
will
be
granted
some
$700
million
and
then
there
is
a
colloquy
between
senator
walsh
and
senator
davis
about
the
size
of
the
initial
appropriations
and
what
they
expect
it
will
be
in
the
future,
and
when
that
finally
ends,
senator
walsh
says,
"mr.
president,
i
think
i
am
now
prepared
to
submit
the
few
amendments
i
have
to
offer.
"
so,
they
just
went
on
to
something
else,
and
one
could
hardly
attribute
significance
of
the
sort
required
for
an
unequivocal
conferral
of
a
tax
exemption
to
the
fact
that
no
one
happened
to
rise
at
an
inopportune
moment
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
to
correct
this
mis-description
that
occurred
in
the
course
of
senator
walsh's
remarks.
now,
the
two
other
matters
on
which
the
appellees
and
the
court
relied
are,
if
anything,
even
less
substantial.
one
is
the
fact
that
an
alternative
bill,
the
ickes
bill,
had
a
more
comprehensively-drafted
exemption
provision.
that
was
a
bill
that
differed
in
many
important
respects
from
the
wagner
bill.
a
written
statement
was
submitted
to
the
committee
on
behalf
of
secretary
ickes,
describing
in
some
detail
the
differences
between
the
two
bills,
no
mention
was
made
of
any
difference
in
tax
consequences
between
the
two
bills.
it
was
the
wagner
bill
that
was
reported
out
of
committee.
there
was
no
indication
that
anyone
on
the
committee
thought
that
a
choice
was
being
made
with
respect
to
tax
consequences
of
these
project
notes,
and
certainly
even
less
reason
to
think
anyone
on
the
floor
was
aware
of
any
difference
in
the
draftsmanship
between
the
two
bills.
and,
finally,
the
reference
is
made
to
a
speech
that
was
made
by
a
federal
official
after
the
enactment
of
the
wagner
housing
act,
a
speech
by
mr.
warren
vinton,
which
expressed
the
view
that
these
notes
would
be
exempt
from
transfer
taxes.
that
speech
displayed
considerable
confusion
on
the
subject.
mr.
vinton
was
not
a
lawyer.
he
had
been
helpful
in
aspects
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
housing
law.
he
was
an
employee
of
the
department
of
agriculture,
the
resettlement
administration
there.
he
knew
something
about
low-cost
housing,
but
he
was
not
definitively
interpreting
the
statute
on
behalf
of
either
the
agency
that
would
be
issuing
the
bonds,
which
was
the
state
or
local
agencies,
or
on
behalf
of
the
internal
revenue
service,
which
has
the
responsibility
to
construe
the
tax
laws.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
rotstein
has
devoted
most
of
his
argument
to
the
issues
which
we
have
urged
that
the
court
need
not
reach.
i
will
comment
briefly
with
respect
to
those.
in
both
cases,
the
claim
for
a
refund
was
not
filed
until
after
the
district
court's
decision
in
haffner
came
down.
in
the
wells
fargo
case,
this
was
two
and
a
half
years
after
the
filing
of
the
estate
tax
return,
in
the
other
case,
more
than
one
year
after
the
filing
of
the
return.
presumably,
a
fiduciary
who
filed
the
return
believing
that
he
has
over-paid
the
taxes
would
act
promptly
so
as
to
secure
the
funds
and
pass
them
along
to
the
beneficiaries
of
the
estate.
it's
quite
apparent
that
they
acted
not
in
reliance
upon
their
thoughts
at
the
time
of
filing
the
returns,
but
in
reliance
upon
the
haffner
decision.
now,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
but
no
matter
how
congress
acted,
unless
it
was
going
to
go
into
a
case-by-case
determination,
it
could
not
satisfy
everybody's
expectations
with
respect
to
the
haffner
case.
even
if
the
new
statute
had
been
completely
prospective,
not
every
taxpayer
who,
after
haffner
came
down,
might
have
transferred
his
assets
into
project
notes
in
reliance
on
haffner,
would
have
had
the
foresight
to
die
before
june
19th,
1984,
and,
therefore,
those
taxpayers'
expectations
would
have
been
thwarted
notwithstanding
their
reliance
on
the
haffner
decision.
and
as
this
court's
leading
modern
case
on
the
retroactivity
of
tax
legislation,
united
states
v.
darismont
in
449
us,
explains
in
detail
most
tax
legislation
has
some
retroactive
effect.
here,
congress
surely
could
have
within
the
rule
of
darismont
made
the
entire
repealer
retroactive
and
treated
all
taxpayers
the
way
they
had
all
been
acting
for
the
previous
forty
years
and
the
way
the
future
ones
would
have
to
act,
namely
paying
tax
on
the
transfer.
instead,
congress
chose
to
mitigate
this
slightly
by
selecting
a
very
restricted
class
of
persons
that
would
be
confined
to
those
in
the
same
situation
as
the
haffner
taxpayers
who
had
done
something
in
reliance
on
this,
but
did
make
it
retroactively
applicable
to
the
great
bulk
of
taxpayers,
most
of
whom
would
be
just
applying
for
an
unexpected
windfall
if
they
happened
to
fall
within
the
dates
properly.
i
believe
we're
ready
to
submit
the
case,
unless
there
are
further
questions.
