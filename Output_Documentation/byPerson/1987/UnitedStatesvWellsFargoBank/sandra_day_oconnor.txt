justice
o'connor
mr.
rotstein,
if
all
we
had
before
us
was
the
language
of
section
5(e)
and
we
didn't
have
the
language
section
20,
would
you
concede
that
the
government's
position
is
correct
in
that
we
would
not
ordinarily
give
that
broad
language
such
a
broad
effect?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
legislative
history
you
rely
on
is
the
statement
of
senator
walsh,
i
gather?
