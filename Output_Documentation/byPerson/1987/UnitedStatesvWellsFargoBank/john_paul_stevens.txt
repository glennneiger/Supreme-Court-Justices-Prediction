justice
stevens
i
really
don't
think
they're
encouraged.
the
statute
applies
only
if
it's
shown...
it's
filed
showing
such
transfer
as
subject
to
tax.
justice
stevens
yeah.
okay.
justice
stevens
was
it
not
true
that
at
the
time
he
made
these
purchases,
there
were
a
lot
of
tax
lawyers
during
the
past
forty
years
or
so,
forty
or
fifty
years,
who
had
thought
they
were
subject
to
estate
tax?
