mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
down
to
whether
the
united
states
government
may
refuse
to
return
a
citizen's
money
for
no
other
reason
than
that
the
government
has
acquired
possession
of
that
money
and
the
district
court
quite
properly
answered
that
question
in
the
negative.
i'll
turn
first
to
the
question
as
to
whether
project
notes
are
exempt
from
federal
estate
tax
under
the
1937
housing
act.
as
the
government
recognized,
the
starting
point
is
the
statutory
language.
section
5(e)
of
the
'37
act,
which
exempted
project
notes
unequivocally
from
all
taxation
now
or
hereafter
imposed
by
the
united
states.
section
20(b)
contained
a
much
more
limited
exemption
for
federal
housing
obligations,
not
project
notes.
these
obligations
were
exempt
from
all
taxation
except
inheritance
taxes
relative
to
estate
taxes.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
your
honor,
i
would
so
concede
if
there
was
not
also
the
legislative
history.
i
believe,
although
it
would
be
a
tougher
case,
if
you
had
the
legislative
history
plus
just
the
section
5(e)
exemption,
i
would
still
say
that
project
notes
are
exempt.
fortunately,
you
have
a
simpler
case
here
because
you
do
have
section
20(b).
now,
the
government
argues
that
section
5(e)
doesn't
exempt
project
notes
by
relying
on
a
line
of
cases,
beginning
with
murdock
v.
ward,
which
holds
that
exemptions
for
all
taxation
in
certain
circumstances
relating
to
bonds
don't
include
an
exemption
for
the
estate
tax.
these
cases
make
a
distinction
between
a
direct
tax
on
a
bond
and
a
transfer
tax.
the
courts
recognized
recently
that
this
is
a
formalistic
distinction
without
economic
consequences,
and
significantly
none
of
the
statutes
considered
in
the
murdock
line
contain
statutory
language
like
1937
act,
that
has
two
sections;
one
with
a
blanket
exemption
and
one
with
a
more
limited
exemption.
similarly,
none
of
the
cases
in
the
murdock
line
consider
statutes
as
legislative
history.
so,
it
clearly
shows
that
congress
intended
to
bestow
an
estate
tax
exemption
on
the
bonds.
now,
we
discussed
the
legislative
history
in
our
brief.
i
won't
repeat
it
here.
it
is
unequivocal.
i
just
want
to
comment,
make
the
comment
that
the
government
really
offers
no
affirmative
history
to
the
effect
that
congress
intended
to
subject
project
notes
to
the
estate
tax,
and
absent
such
affirmative
evidence,
there's
no
reason
to
disregard
the
plain
meaning
of
the
'37
act
and
the
legislative
history
affirmatively
showing
that
project
notes
were
exempt.
and,
so,
the
government
actually
resorts
to--
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
--well,
it's
the
statement
of
senator
walsh
plus
the
version,
the
rejected
version,
of
secretary
ickes,
which
contained
a
reference
to
estate
tax
and
section
5(e).
there's
also
the
vinton
statement,
which
i
realize
isn't
legislative
history
with
post-enactment,
but
we
believe
that
that's
also
persuasive.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
well,--
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
--it
is
a
tax
on
the
transfer.
we're
not
denying
that,
but
the
plain
language
argument
is
simply
that
when
you
look
at
the
'37
act
and
compare
section
5(e)
and
20(b),
it
couldn't
mean
anything,
5(e)
could
not
have
any
other
meaning
than
a
congressional
intent
to
exempt
project
notes
from
the
estate
tax,
read
in
light
of
20(b)
as
the
statutes
are
to
be
read.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
in
light
of
20(b).
the
government
falls
back
on
two
arguments
that
we
believe
are
really
only
attempts
to
elicit
a
visceral
antagonism
to
the
district
court's
interpretation
of
section
5(e).
they
first
argue
that
section
5(e)
couldn't
have
exempted
project
notes
from
the
estate
tax
because
to
do
so
would
have
resulted
in
wholesale
avoidance
of
estate
tax.
first,
this
is
merely
an
impermissible
attempt
to
have
the
court
rewrite
the
1937
act,
but,
second,
it's
inaccurate.
in
1937,
when
congress
passed
the
1937
act,
far
from
being
concerned
that
all
taxpayers
are
going
to
run
out
and
buy
project
notes,
they
were
concerned
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
market
for
them.
so,
from
the
perspective
of
the
75th
congress,
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
were
concerned
and,
in
fact,
there's
reason
to
believe
that
the
estate
tax
exemption
was
an
incentive
to
make
project
notes
saleable.
the
government
also
argues
that
section
5(e)
exemption
couldn't
include
an
exemption
from
estate
tax
because
the
tax
bar
was
taken
by
surprise.
with
due
respect
to
the
tax
bar,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
the
first
time
that
they
were
surprised
by
a
statute.
i'll
quote
justice
frankfurter,
i'll
take
the
risk
of
doing
it,
"wisdom
too
often
never
comes,
so
one
ought
not
to
reject
it
merely
because
it
comes
too
late.
"
just
because
the
tax
bar
became
wise
a
little
late
doesn't
mean
we
should
reject
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
5(e)
of
the
1937
act.
i'll
next
turn
briefly
to
the
question
of
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
641(b)(2)
of
the
deficit
reduction
act,
which
the
government
says,
irrespective
of
what
section
5(e)
means
under
the
1937
act,
retroactively
taxes
the
estates
here.
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief,
it's
a
proper
construction
of
section
641(b)(2)
that
it
should
not
be
construed
retroactively.
that
will
avoid
the
serious
constitutional
questions
raised
by
retroactive
interpretation.
i
just
want
to
make
two
additional
points
to
the
ones
we
make
in
our
brief.
under
the
government's
interpretation,
section
641(b)(2)
by
implication
repeals
an
estate's
right
to
sue
for
refund,
and
it
does
so
by
implication.
this
right
has
been
established
for
decades
and
given
the
fact
that
there
was
very
little,
if
no,
legislative
consideration
of
section
641(b)(2),
it's
not
plausible
that
congress
would
have
had
such
an
intent.
this
leads
to
the
next
point
and
that
is
when,
in
enacting
defra
in
1984,
congress
wanted
to
repeal
a
right
to
refund,
it
said
so
explicitly.
they
did
so
in
defra
section
2662(g),
which,
in
much
clearer
language,
makes
the
statute
there
retroactive
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
which
congress
specifically
said
that
they
wanted
to
repeal
a
right
for
refund.
so,
juxtaposing
641(b)(2)
with
2662(g),
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and,
i
believe,
logic,
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
in
enacting
section
641(b)(2),
congress
didn't
intent
to
make
the
section
retroactive,
and
that
has
the
presence
for
a
non-retroactive
interpretation
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
schwab
v.
doyle
and
hessett
v.
welch.
now,
i
want
to
indicate
what
will
happen
here
if
the
government's
interpretation
of
section
641(b)(2)
as
being
retroactive
prevails,
and
that
is
that
taxpayers
are
going
to
be
encouraged
in
doubtful
cases
to
take
aggressive
positions
vis-a-vis
the
taxability
of
an
item.
that
is,
in
a
doubtful
case,
because
section
641(b)(2)
retroactively
applied
penalizes
the
reporting
taxpayer,
the
conservative
taxpayer,
the
taxpayers
will
be
more
likely
not
to
report
a
doubtful
item.
in
other
words,
taxpayers
will
be
encouraged
to
play
the
audit
lottery.
this
goes
against
mainstream
tax
thinking
and
congressional
thinking
that
has
been
established
for
years
and
the
concomitant
costs
to
the
government,
i
think,
are
evident.
there
will
be
unreported
taxable
transactions--
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
--that's
my
understanding.
project
notes
were
bearer
notes.
so,
it's
very
conceivable
that
that
could
occur.
my
understanding
is
that
you
do
not
have
to
list
something
if
they're
not
taxable,
and
the
taxpayer
can
play
the
audit
lottery
and
the
government,
if
the
interpretation
of
section
641
is
deemed
to
be
retroactive,
is
going
to
lose
the
audit
lottery.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
that's
true.
that's
a
more
conservative
approach.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
it
could
be
wise.
it's
certainly
not
inevitable
given
the
fact
that
even
now
taxpayers
play
the
audit
lottery
by
not
listing
something
and
hoping
that
they'll
get
away
with
it.
not
to
impede
criminal
intent,
but
it
happens
and
this--
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
--the
get-by
doctrine?
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
it's
the
get-by
doctrine,
and
this
kind
of
conduct
will
be
encouraged.
it's
not
logical
that
in
the
space
of
about
six
weeks
in
a
bill
that
was
introduced
for
the
first
time
in
conference
and
had
no
senate
debate,
no
house
debate
associated
with
it,
congress
would
want
to
effectuate
such
a
bill.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
a
taxpayer
could
do
that.
it's
the
prudent
step,
but
that
hasn't
been
a
requirement
for
about
sixty
years,
and
taxpayers
haven't
necessarily
proceeded
that
way.
i
can
see
that
that
would
be
a
prudent
step.
i'll
turn
now
to--
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
--i
do
not.
i'm
a
litigator.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
in
this
case,
justice
blackman.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
more
prudent
executors
and
tax
lawyers
may
do
just
that.
the
less
prudent
individuals
may
be
encouraged
not
to
report.
i'd
like
to
turn
now--
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
the
district
court
found
that
retroactively-applied
section
641(b)(2)
violates
both
the
due
process
clause
and
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we
didn't
raise
those
constitutional
claims
lightly
below
and
we
don't
so
here,
but
retroactively
applying
section
641(b)(2)
would
go
far
beyond
the
pale
of
what
the
constitution
permits
and
what
this
case
what
this
court
has
allowed
in
its
cases
construing
retroactive
tax
statutes.
there
are
two
reasons
why
section
641
(b)(2)
if
retroactively
applied
would
violate
the
due
process
clause
first,
it
constitutes
a
harsh
and
oppressive
retroactive
tax
that
has
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
effect.
i'll
focus
on
the
stein
estate
for
a
moment.
dr.
stein
bought
project
notes
in
1980
and
1981.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
from
about...
he
died
in
april.
the
last
one
was
a
couple
of
months
before
his
death,
i
believe,
maybe
even
a
month
before
his
death,
six
to
eight
months.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
all
purchased
within
a
year.
he
did
so
in
1981
and
in
1980
and
'81.
there
had
been
no
public
ruling
at
all.
for
a
period
of
forty
years,
the
project
notes
were
subject
to
the
estate
tax.
project
notes
were
issued
pursuant
to
1977
and
1980
government
offering
circulars,
advertisements
if
you
will,
in
which
the
government
used
the
tax-free
nature
of
project
notes
as
a
selling
point.
as
a
general
matter.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
the
government
argues
that.
there's
no...
there's
only
inferential
evidence.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
that
or
no
authority.
the
only
inferential
evidence
is
that
the
tax
law
reacted
in
1984
to
the
haffner
decision.
there
is
some
authority
albeit
not
definitive,
but
it's
certainly
indicative
that
there
were
taxpayers
out
there
before
1984
who
were
not
reporting
project
notes
as
part
of
an
estate.
i
refer
to
a
1955
housing
authority
memorandum
that
said
the
matter
as
to
the
taxability
of
project
notes
as
part
of
an
estate
will
have
to
be
decided
by
the
courts.
i
also
refer
to
defra
section
628,
which,
for
the
first
time
in
1984
around
the
time
haffner
was
decided,
subjected
project
notes
to
information
and
reporting
requirements.
before...
certainly
when
dr.
stein
bought
the
notes,
project
notes
were
bearer
bonds
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
628,
congress
specifically
referred
to
haffner.
the
logical
conclusion
is
that
congress
was
concerned
that
there
were
people
out
there
who
hadn't
been
reporting
project
notes.
so,
although
the
government
argues,
and
there
was
a
lot
of
publicity
after
haffner,
we
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
decedents
were
or
were
not
reporting
project
notes.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
he
was
in
good
health
right
up
till
the
end.
i
think
he
was
quite
old
but
he
was
it
good
health.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
it
could
have
been.
i
have
nothing
in
the
record,
but
it's
possible.
dr.
stein
certainly
had
no
way
of
foreseeing
the
enactment
of
defra
section
641(b)(2),
which
was
introduced
three
years
before
his
death.
three
years
is
a
very
long
period
of
retroactivity.
most
of
the
cases
upholding
a
retroactive
period
do
so
in
the
income
tax
situation
and
do
so
in
the
income
tax
area,
and
in
addition,
had
dr.
stein
had
an
inkling
that
project
notes
would
be
retroactively
taxed,
he
had
beneficial
alternatives.
he
could
have
invested
in
something
else.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
i
do
not.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
that's
correct,
and
neither
did
the
executors
claim
exemptions.
both
reported
them
subject
to
tax.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
well,
that's
why
we're
here,
justice
blackmun.
the
executors
reported
them
as
taxable
after...
in
light
of
a
revenue
ruling
that
came
down
in--
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
--in
our
case.
and,
therefore,
there
was
a
claim
for
refund
later
filed.
quite
simply,
there
is
no
case
upholding
a
retroactive
statute
in
which
the
facts
are
like
this.
this
case
is
unprecedented
in
the
scope
of
the
decedent's
legitimate
expectations
as
to
non-taxability--
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
executors
of
the
estates
reported
project
notes
as
taxable
under
compulsion
of
a
revenue
ruling
that
came
down
in
1981,
indicating
that
they
were
taxable.
that
didn't
exist
when
the
decedents
made
their
purchases.
so,
the
decedents
crafted
their
conduct
on
the
existence
of
the
tax
exemption.
when
the
executors
got
around
to,
in
our
case,
when
the
executors
got
around
to
reporting,
the
executors
were
under
compulsion
of
a
revenue
ruling,
and--
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
--an
executor
can
take
other
action.
however,
executors
are
fiduciaries,
and
it's
certainly
prudent
to
pay
a
tax
and
knowing
that
or
believing
that
a
right
to
refund
is
preserved
in
order
not
to
have
to
subject
the
estate
to
possible
interest
and
payment
penalties.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
in
haffner,
they
apparently
paid
the
tax
but
listed...
disputed
on
the
return
the
fact
that
project
notes
were
taxable.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
rotstein
the
record
indicates
that
they
paid
the
tax
and
reported
them
as
taxable
by
virtue
of
the
revenue
ruling,
and
at
that
point,
that
was
the
only
public
pronouncement
of
any
kind
regarding
the
taxability
of
project
notes.
section
641(b)(2)
retroactively
applied
also
works
to
violate
the
due
process
clause
by
depriving
the
estates
here
of
procedural
due
process.
by
precluding
judicial
review
of
the
question
whether
project
notes
are
exempt
from
taxation.
the
government
in
its
reply
characterizes
section
641(b)(2)
as
merely
a
substantive
change
in
the
law,
but
in
its
opening
brief,
the
government,
i
think,
more
accurately
describes
section
641(b)(2)
as
permitting
certain
taxpayers
who
did
not
report
project
notes
as
taxable
but
not
the
estates
here
"to
continue
to
litigate
the
questions
of
taxability.
"
at
the
same
time,
the
government
describes
the
effect
of
section
641
as
permitting
the
non-reporting
taxpayer
"to
go
ahead
and
have
their
day
in
court.
"
these
are
words
of
procedural
due
process
and
they're
accurate.
the
executors
have
been
deprived
of
their
day
in
court
by
virtue
of
the
government's
invocation
of
defra
section
on
641(b)(2).
effectively,
the
government's
interpretation
of
section
641(b)(2)
has
caught
the
estates
in
a
procedural
trap.
on
day
one,
there
were
two
equally
available
and
well-established
alternatives.
one,
the
estates
could
have
chosen
not
to
pay
the
tax
and
to
litigate
the
matter
in
tax
court.
two,
they
could
have,
as
they
did,
pay
the
tax,
expecting
that
at
least
for
the
statutory
period,
they
had
the
right
to
bring
a
suit
in
district
court
or
the
court
of
claims
for
a
refund.
it's
been
established
that
these
two
alternatives
are
equally
available
and
both
there.
now,
retroactive
interpretation
of
section
641
(b)(2)
would
take
away
that
second
alternative,
the
one
that
the
estates
here
took,
yet
because
the
estates
chose
that
second
avenue,
they
can
no
longer
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
court,
yet
there
are
individuals
out
there
in
the
tax
court
still
litigating
the
issue
of
the
taxability
of
project
notes.
the
due
process
clause
prohibits
just
that
type
of
procedural
trap.
finally,
the
district
court
found
that
section
641(b)(2)
retroactively
applied
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that's
accurate.
section
641
sets
up
a
classification
that
distinguishes
between
executors
who
listed
project
notes
as
taxable
on
a
return
and
those
who
did
not.
this
classification
bears
no
rationale
relationship
to
any
legitimate
government
purpose.
it
taxes
the
estates
here
that
conservatively
paid
their
taxes
and
reported
project
notes
as
taxable.
it
exonerates
other
similarly-situated
executors
whose
decedents
died
the
same
days
as
the
decedents
here,
whose
executors
filed
tax
returns
on
the
same
day,
and
yet
who,
for
some
reason,
didn't
report
project
notes.
perhaps
taking
an
aggressive
position,
perhaps
just
forgetting
to
do
so,
acting
negligently,
and
section
641(b)(2)
would
tax
the
estates
here,
but
would
not
tax
the
common
evader
who
decedent
died
the
same
day
as
dr.
stein,
but
who
failed
to
file
a
return
at
all
for
the
purpose
of
evading
other
taxes.
the
only
real
justification
that
the
government
offers
for
the
classification
of
section
641(b)(2)
is
that
it
gives
its
expectations
as
to
the
decedents'
belief
as
to
taxability.
it
gives
effect
to
those
expectations.
in
other
words,
the
government
says
that
reporting
position
on
a
return
is
equivalent
to
the
taxpayer's
expectations.
that's
flawed
for
two
reasons,
and
it
doesn't
set
forth
the
rationale
classification.
first,
it
incorrectly
focuses
on
the
executor's
expectation
and
it's
the
decedent
who
was
the
individual
charged
with
planning
the
estate
and
who
relied
on
the
tax
laws.
and,
second,
in
our
tax
system,
traditionally
reporting
hasn't
been
a
gauge
of
a
taxpayer's
expectation.
it's
not
a
rationale
gauge.
it's
been
given
in
the
tax
system
that
a
taxpayer
may
either
choose
to
sue
in
the
district
court
and
pay
the
tax,
as
we
did,
or
to
pay
in
tax
court,
and
there
are
many
reasons
unrelated
to
a
taxpayer's
expectation
as
to
taxability
as
to
why
the
taxpayer
would
go
ahead
and
pay
the
tax
and
sue
in
the
district
court.
one,
just
in
general,
is
that
a
taxpayer
may
want
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
claims
rather
than
the
tax
court.
secondly,
there
may
be
a
case
farther
along
in
the
system,
and
rather
than
risk
interest
payments,
penalty
payments,
the
taxpayer
may
just
file
a
return,
pay
the
tax,
and
await
the
outcome
of
the
litigation.
here,
especially
where
you
have
an
estate,
as
we
do
here,
it
may
be
prudent
for
an
executor
to
pay
the
tax
and
file
a
claim
for
refund
in
order
to
ward
off
the
possibility
of
interest
and
penalties
in
prudent
exercise
of
the
executor's
fiduciary
duty.
that's
especially
true
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
internal
revenue
service
has
taken
a
position
that
project
notes
were
taxable,
contrary
to
what
the
law
is,
and
even
after
haffner,
so
aggressive
was
the
internal
revenue
service's
position
that
they
indicated
they
were
going
to
continue
to
litigate
the
matter,
notwithstanding
the
haffner
opinion.
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
the
decision
not
to
report
is
not
a
rationale
indicator
of
a
taxpayer's
expectation.
the
most
obvious
example
is
the
taxpayer
whom,
to
avoid
taxes,
fails
to
file
a
return
at
all.
presumably,
the
failure
to
file
a
return,
the
failure
to
report
any
items
is
because
the
taxpayer
believes
the
items
to
be
taxable,
yet
doesn't
want
to
be
subject
to
the
tax.
so,
there's
a
failure
to
report.
there
is
simply
no
rationale
basis
for
the
classifications
set
forth
in
641(b)(2)
if
applied
retroactively,
and
the
equal
protection
problem
stems,
we
believe,
from
the
hasty
enactment
and
the
lack
of
consideration
given
to
section
641(b)(2).
it
was
the
fertile
environment
for
passing
a
law
that
sets
forth
in
a
rationale
classification.
in
the
time
i
have
left,
i'll
briefly
summarize
why
the
district
court's
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
first,
project
notes
are
exempt
from
federal
estate
taxation
under
the
united
states
housing
act
of
1937.
this
follows
both
from
the
statutory
structure
and
the
legislative
history.
second,
defra
section
641(b)(2)
based
on
the
precedence
of
the
court
need
not
be
interpreted
retroactively
but
can
be
interpreted
prospectively
only
to
avoid
the
constitutional
questions
yet
affirmed.
if
interpreted
retroactively,
section
641(b)(2)
violates
the
due
process
clause,
both
because
it's
a
harsh,
oppressive
and
arbitrary
retroactive
tax,
and
because
it
deprives
the
estates
here
to
the
right
of
judicial
review
on
the
haffner
claim
by
virtue
of
the
government's
invocation
of
section
641(b)(2).
and,
finally,
section
641(b)(2)
retroactively
applied
violates
the
equal
protection
component
by
setting
forth
an
arbitrary
and
irrational
classification
between
reporting
taxpayers
and
non-reporting
taxpayers.
therefore,
treating
the
appellees'
estates
less
favorably
than
a
common
tax
evader.
thank
you.
