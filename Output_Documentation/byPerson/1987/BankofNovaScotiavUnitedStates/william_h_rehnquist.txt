chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
and
first
this
morning
is
no.
87-578,
the
bank
of
nova
scotia
v.
the
united
states;
no.
87-602,
william
kilpatrick
against
the
united
states.
mr.
nesland,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
talking
about
dismissal
before
trial?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
nesland,
i
have
read
the
record,
and
i
must
say
it
discloses
a
certain
amount
of
arrogance
on
the
part
of
the
tax
commission,
which
anyone
who
has
practiced
in
the
provinces
is
familiar
with,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
show
the
sort
of
flagrant
type
of
thing
that
you
are
suggesting.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
a
ground
for
dismissing
an
indictment?
how
about
our
costello
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
supposing...
can
one
challenge
an
indictment
after
it
has
been
returned
on
the
grounds
that
a
witness
who
testified
before
the
jury
gave
false
testimony?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
is
open
to
challenge
to
the
indictment?
what
case
of
our
court
supports
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that
isn't
the
same
thing
as
knowingly
presented
perjured
testimony.
i
mean,
misinformation
is
kind
of
a
weasel
word.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
grounds
for
challenging
an
indictment
returned
by
a
grand
jury
that
one
of
the
witnesses
gave
"unreliable"
testimony?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
but
you
could
say
that
hearsay
testimony
was
unreliable,
which
is
what
we
said
you
couldn't
challenge
in
costello.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
ultimate...
surely
the
ultimate
rule
for
which
you
argue
must
be
based
on
the
idea
that
if
these
errors
hadn't
occurred,
the
grant
jury
wouldn't
have
indicted.
otherwise,
why
isn't
that
state
of
affairs
perfectly
satisfactory?
so
long
as
the
grand
jury
does
what
it
would
have
done
without
the
errors,
why
does
it
develop
a
body
of
law
enforcing
a
lot
of
standards
that
really
haven't...
whose
violation
hasn't
hurt
anyone?
chief
justice
rehnquist
protect...
from
what?
protected
from
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
you
are
seeking
a
rule
which
would
go
further
than
just
focus
on
whether
the
grand
jury's
conduct
was
influenced
by
whether
or
not
an
indictment
was
returned.
you
want
some
sort
of
a
marquis
of
queensbury
rule
that
would
say
even
though
there
is
no
practical
effect
here,
nonetheless
we
should
discipline
these
people,
and
the
court
should
do
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
to
refuse
to
indict
where
the
government
has
not
shown
probable
cause.
and
if
your
standards
were
directed
there,
they
would
certainly
find
a
more
sympathetic
reception
to
me.
but
you
are
saying,
no,
we
shouldn't
focus
on
whether
or
not
the
grand
jury
would
have
indicted
or
not
indicted
given
the
absence
of
the
government.
you're
saying
that
if
there
was
violation
of
rules,
whether
or
not
it
affected
the
grand
jury,
we
should
dismiss
the
indictment,
without
any
causal
link
at
all.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
by
hypothesis
has
failed
of
that
intent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nesland.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
bryson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
alternative
would
be
simply
to
take
someone's
informal
word
that
if
they
are
called
they
are
going
to
take
the
fifth
amendment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
fact
that
it
may
not
be
reversible
error
in
any
context,
does
not
prevent
it
from
reflecting
on
the
department?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
nesland,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nesland.
the
case
is
submitted.
