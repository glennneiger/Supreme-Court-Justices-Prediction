justice
stevens
but
did
the
district
court
find
that
there
was
a
knowing
use
of
perjury
testimony?
justice
stevens
mr.
bryson,
before
you
go
on,
what
about
the
testimony
of
this
witness
mendrop,
about
the
bank's
knowledge,
do
you
think
that
was
proper?
justice
stevens
i
know
the
record
so
well.
the
district
court
made
these
findings,
which
i
guess
you
are
saying
are
really
erroneous.
one,
that
his
testimony
is
both
misleading
and
inaccurate.
you
are
saying
that's
not
right.
and,
secondly,
he
said
the
grand
jury
was
never
informed
of
these
mischaracterizations,
or
of
any
alternative
basis
for
mendrop's
summary.
so
you
are
saying
that
those
findings
are
clearly
erroneous.
justice
stevens
do
you
think...
i
mean,
again,
i
have
great
confidence
in
you.
i
am
sure
you
are
representing
the
record
correctly.
but
do
you
think
as
we
sit
here,
should
we
go
behind
the
district
court's
findings
to
dispose
of
this
case?
