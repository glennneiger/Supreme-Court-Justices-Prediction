justice
o'connor
mr.
nesland,
may
i
inquire
of
whether...
if
we
think
that
some
sort
of
prejudice
is
required
to
be
shown,
or
that
some
sort
of
grave
doubt
about
whether
the
grand
jury's
decision
to
indict
was
influenced
here,
could
you
meet
that
standard,
and
did
you
meet
that
standard
below?
justice
o'connor
but
we
have
to
take
it,
the
case
here,
on
the
assumption
that
there
as
no
prejudice?
justice
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
nesland,
what
is
the
proper
test
of
prejudice
in
your
view?
what
is
the
standard
by
which
a
court
below
will
determine
whether
there
is
prejudice?
have
you
looked
at
any
of
our
cases
to
determine
what
that
standard
should
be?
justice
o'connor
in
mechanik?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
just
can't
ever
be
met,
that
you
can
show
there
is
grave
doubt
about
whether
the
decision
of
the
grand
jury
was
affected?
justice
o'connor
because
i
thought
you
answered
me
at
the
outset,
that
you
thought
in
this
case
that
standard
could
have
been
met.
justice
o'connor
did
the
court
of
appeals
apply
that
standard?
justice
o'connor
what
standard
do
you
think
they
apply?
justice
o'connor
mr.
bryson,
what
do
you
think
the
standard
for
prejudice
should
be
in
this
context?
justice
o'connor
do
you
agree
with
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
mechanik?
justice
o'connor
and
did
the
court
below
apply
that
test,
or
standard?
justice
o'connor
did
it
apply
the
grave
doubt
standard?
justice
o'connor
no,
i
don't
think
they
did,
but
i
think
that
it
was
applied.
justice
o'connor
can
you
look
at
the
cumulative
effect
of
all
the
errors
in
determining
whether
you
have
grave
doubt
about
the
effect
on
the
decision?
