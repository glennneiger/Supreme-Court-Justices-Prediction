justice

is
that
the
most
egregious
one
that
occurred
in
this
case,
in
your
view?
justice
kennedy
and
what
about
the
reference
to
the
grand
jury
proceedings
by
tax
agents
and
tax
auditors
in
other
civil
audits?
was
that
appropriate,
or
was
that
improper?

justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
next
case,
the
bank
of
nova
scotia
versus
united
states,
87-578.
these
cases
come
to
us
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
they
present
the
issue
whether
a
district
court
may
invoke
its
supervisory
power
to
dismiss
an
indictment
for
prosecutorial
misconduct
in
a
grand
jury
investigation
where
the
misconduct
does
not
prejudice
the
defendants.
in
the
cases
before
us,
the
petitioners
were
charged
with
tax
fraud
and
conspiracy.
the
district
court,
however,
dismissed
the
indictment
on
all
counts.
it
held
10
days
of
hearings
and
identified
various
incidents
which
it
found
to
be
prosecutorial
misconduct.
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that,
and
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
district
court
had
no
authority
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
we
now
affirm.
the
standard
of
prejudice
the
court
should
apply
in
determining
whether
to
dismiss
an
indictment
for
error
or
irregularity
in
the
course
of
grand
jury
proceedings
at
least
where
dismissal
is
sought
for
non-constitutional
error,
is
the
standard
articulated
by
justice
o'connor
and
her
concurring
opinion
in
united
states
versus
mechanik.
under
this
standard
dismissal
of
the
indictment
is
appropriate
only
if
it
is
established
that
the
violation
substantially
influenced
the
grand
jury's
decision
to
indict
or
if
there
is
grave
doubt
that
the
decision
to
indict
was
free
from
the
substantial
influence
of
such
violations.
applying
the
standard
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
find
that
the
record
will
not
support
the
conclusion
that
petitioners
were
prejudiced.
the
district
court
erred
in
dismissing
the
indictment.
justice
scalia
joins
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
