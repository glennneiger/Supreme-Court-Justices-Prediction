justice
scalia
what
kind
of
misconduct
wouldn't
qualify
under
that
standard?
i
mean,
i
assume
that
the
reason
it
is
misconduct
is
that
it
has
been
determined
by
this
society
that
this
kind
of
activity
is
not
necessary,
or
not
proper
for
the
proper
investigation
of
the
truth.
is
there
anything
that
wouldn't
qualify
under
the
standard
you
are
setting
forth
here?
justice
scalia
mr.
nesland,
i
don't
understand
the
distinction.
if
you
have
an
indictment
that
comes
out
of
the
grand
jury
that
isn't
independent,
isn't
that
a
tainted
indictment?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
i
don't
separate
that
from
some
other
errors
that
go
to
whether
the
indictment
was
correct
or
not.
i
mean,
if
it
comes
form
a
non-independent
grand
jury,
it's
not
a
correct
indictment,
no
matter
how
much
the
facts
might
support
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
and
that
leads
me
to
another
point.
do
you
know
of
any
of
our
cases
that
support
the
proposition
that
we
have
supervisory
authority,
and
that
couldn't
be
equivalently
explained,
not
on
the
basis
of
equivalent
authority,
but
on
the
basis
that
we
will
not
entertain
an
invalid
indictment?
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
we
are
in
the
business
of
supervising
the
prosecutor,
but
an
indictment
is
not
a
good
indictment
that
does
not
come
from
a
proper
grand
jury,
is
simply
not
valid
before
our
eyes.
can't
we
explain
all
that
we
have
said
in
this
area
on
that
basis?
justice
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
do
you
know
any
case
of
this
court
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
proposition
that
we...
that
the
courts
have
some
indirect
supervisory
effect;
that
is,
to
the
extent
they
throw
away
an
indictment
that
has
been
affected
by
misconduct.
of
course,
that
will
bear
upon
how
the
prosecutor
will
behave
in
the
future.
but,
nonetheless,
is
there
any
case
that
couldn't
be
explained,
or
even
statements
in
cases
that
can't
be
explained,
simply
on
the
assumption
that
we
will
not...
it
is
just
like
a
complaint.
it
isn't
properly
signed,
or
isn't
properly
validated.
an
indictment
that
comes
from
a
non-independent
grand
jury,
or
that
has
been
vitiated
by
conduct
of
such...
to
such
a
degree
of
error
that
it
has
affected
the
judgment
of
the
grand
jury,
is
simply
no
good.
can't
we
explain
all
our
cases
on
that
ground?
