mr.
james
e.
nesland
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
district
court
may
exercise
supervisory
authority
to
dismiss
an
indictment
before
trial
before
that
district
court
finds
that
the
indictment
was
procured
by
deliberate,
pervasive,
intentional
misconduct.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
briefly
outline
the
three
issues
which
we
believe
this
question
raises.
the
first
issue
is
whether
a
district
court
may
dismiss
an
indictment
under
a
supervisory
authority
absent
finding
that
the
misconduct
substantially
prejudiced
the
defendant.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
yes,
we
are,
justice.
we
believe
judge
seymour's
dissent
is
correct
in
the
court
below,
that
united
states
v.
hastings,
that
young
v.
united
states,
and
i
submit
more
recently
the
case
in
illinois
v.
taylor,
confirm
that
actual
prejudice
to
a
defendant
is
not
a
condition
to,
and
does
not
foreclose
the
court's
exercise
of
supervisory
authority.
as
judge
seymour
held
in
her
dissenting
opinion,
the
balancing
approach
established
by
the
supervisory
authority
is
unnecessary
if
actual
prejudice
is
always
required
in
every
case.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
your
honor,
i
might
answer
it
this
way
and
say
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
majority
opinion
held
that
we
had
not
established
substantial
prejudice.
we
challenged
in
this
court,
and
the
court
denied
certiorari
on
the
issue
that
that
court
of
appeals
decision,
majority
opinion,
was
unfounded
and
infirm
on
that
ground.
so
that
we
stand
here
at
least
with
the
majority's
opinion
that
no
prejudice
was
shown.
we
do
believe
that
there
was
substantial
prejudice
below
that
all
of
this
misconduct
substantially
influenced
the
outcome.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
issue
is
foreclosed
by
this
court's
denial
of
certiorari
on
the
issue
of
both
a
methodology
and
the
standard
of
proof
below.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
the
second
issue
we
believe
that
is
raised
by
this
question
is
in
what
circumstances
can
the
court
exercise
that
supervisory
authority
when
there
is
no
prejudice.
we
believe
when
it
finds,
as
the
district
court
did
here,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturb
those
findings,
that
the
misconduct
was
deliberate,
when
the
conduct
and
the
acts
of
misconduct
were
pervasive,
and
when
they
were
intended
to
prejudice
the
grand
jury.
reverting
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
we
believe
that
in
any
case
where
the
court
exercises
supervisory
authority,
that
the
court
must
look
to
whether
there
is
a
likelihood
of
prejudice
if
these
kinds
of
acts
are
not
stopped,
and
this
kind
of
misconduct
is
not
prevented.
and
that
likelihood
was
present
in
this
case,
and
that
likelihood
is
present
in
this
case
if
this
case
is
affirmed
by
this
court.
we
believe
prejudice--
mr.
james
e.
nesland
--yes,
your
honor.
it
is
a
balancing
approach,
and
i
believe
that
the
court
in
any
acts
of
misconduct,
even
under
the
balanced
approach
that
is
suggested
in
hastings,
and
under
the
supervisory
authority,
must
determine
first
whether
or
not
that
kind
of
misconduct
is
deliberate,
whether
or
not
it
is
pervasive,
and
the
importance
of
pervasiveness,
justice
scalia,
is
whether
or
not
that
kind
of
misconduct
is
likely
to
recur,
whether
or
not
that
kind
of
misconduct
is
substantially
influential.
and,
third,
whether
or
not
that
misconduct
is
directed
at
the
process.
for
example,
in
united
states
v.
morrison,
this
court
held
that
an
agent
who
had
tried
to
secure
the
cooperation
of
a
defendant
after
indictment,
and
deliberately
violated
that
defendant's
constitutional
right
to
counsel,
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
prejudice
there
because
it
was
after
indictment.
so
there
are
acts
of
deliberate
misconduct
that
for
causation
purposes
the
court
would
not
have
to
consider.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
your
honor,
we
rely
on
all
of
those
that
were
found
by
the
district
court,
and
undisturbed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
well,
the
swearings
of
the
agents
of
the
grand
jury,
and
the
use
of
those
agents
in
a
manner
which
led,
and
misled,
i
suggest,
the
grand
jury
to
believe
that
these
people
were
not
acting
as
irs
agents
anymore,
that
they
were
fiduciaries
of
the
grand
jury,
and
they
allowed
those
irs
agents
in
violation
of
rule
6(d)
to
represent
virtually
the
entire
case
that
was
presented
from
the
first
grand
jury
to
the
second
grand
jury
without
the
attorneys
being
available,
being
present,
most
of
the
time.
and
if
the
court
looks
at
the
record
in
this
case,
you
will
see
in
the
appendix,
"noting
that
the
agents
were
in
the
grand
jury
reading.
"
that
is
all
you
see.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
then
we
have
the
6(e)
violations,
justice
brennan,
in
which
the
government
for
purposes
of
prejudicing
these
defendants
were
disclosing
that
they
were
under
investigation,
were
disclosing
that
they
were
under
investigation
in
tax
shelters,
and
they
were
disclosing
that
outside
the
grand
jury
to
people
who
were
working
with
the
tax
shelter
operation,
to
people
that
were
investing
in
a
tax
shelter
operation,
and
the
purpose
was
found
that
that
was
to
prejudice
to
try
to
interfere
with
and
stop
the
tax
shelter
program
long
before,
long
before,
the
indictment
was
handed
down.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
yes,
your
honor.
the
6(e)
violations
with
respect
to
mr.
blondin,
one
of
the
prosecutors,
called
the
former
defense
attorney
for
certain
of
the
targets.
those
two
defense
counsel,
and
they
were
securities
defense
counsel,
that
represented
the
targets
in
the
sec
investigation
that
preceded
the
grand
jury
investigation,
and
for
tactical
advantages
they
obligated
those
two
witnesses
out
of
the
hundreds
of
witnesses
in
this
case,
they
were
the
only
two
that
were
told
that
you
cannot
discuss
your
appearance,
or
the
contents
of
your
appearance,
or
what
was
happening
here,
with
your
attorneys,
with
anybody
outside
the
grand
jury.
in
addition--
mr.
james
e.
nesland
--your
honor,
what
was
presented
to
the
court
below,
and
what
the
district
court
has
to
look
at,
was
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
this
case.
for
example,
with
respect
to
the
bank
of
nova
scotia,
at
the
tail
end,
the
very
tail
end
of
the
grand
jury
process,
and
indeed
the
last
day
or
two
of
the
20
month
period
that
it
was
under
investigation,
the
bank
for
the
first
time
was
presented
to
the
grand
jury
as
a
potential
target.
and
at
that
time
these
agents,
these
grand
jury
agents,
summarized
what
they
contended
was
all
the
evidence,
but
it
was
not,
to
the
grand
jury.
and
in
that
summarization
they
falsely
informed
the
grand
jury
of
several
critical
facts
with
respect
to
the
bank,
so
that
you
had...
and
the
court
below
found...
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturb
that
these
agents,
and
these
prosecutors,
knowingly
presented
misinformation
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
your
honor,
i
don't
think
in
united
states
the
costello...
the
question
was
whether
or
not
misinformation
was
presented
to
that
grand
jury.
what
the
issue,
as
i
understand
in
costello
was
whether
or
not
hearsay.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
well,
there
are
certain
courts
of
appeals,
your
honor,
that
do
allow
that,
but
i
would
suggest
it
would
be
different
if
the
prosecutors
knowingly
presented
perjury
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
there
is
no
court
of
appeals...
there
is
no
supreme
court
decision
holding
that,
but
we
would
suggest
that
that
is
the
kind
of
case
that
the
supervisory
authority
is
intended
to
reach
where
the
government
purposely
violates
the
law,
purposely
tries
to
prejudice
by
abusive
practices,
the
grand
jury's
decision-making
responsibility.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
i
think
that
is
a
semantical
difference.
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
there
was
knowing
use
of
misinformation,
and
maybe
i
can
clear
it
up
a
little
bit
if
i
point
to
one
of
the
pieces
of
information,
and
only
one
of
the
pieces
of
information,
that
they
were
talking
about.
the
agents
testified
that
an
individual
by
the
name
of
mr.
waters
had
testified
that
the
bank
knew
that
the
tax
shelter
operation
was
illegal
because
a
bank
president
from
the
bank
of
nova
scotia
had
come
to
meet
with
mr.
kilpatrick
in
denver.
what
had
happened
is
mr.
waters
had
never
testified.
mr.
waters
had
been
interviewed,
and
the
prosecutor
below
testified
that
they
learned
before
they
presented
this
matter
finally
to
the
grand
jury
that
there
was
serious
question
whether
or
not
that
information
was
correct.
and
yet
they
went
ahead
and
used
that
information,
summarized
it
to
the
grand
jury
without
ever
letting
them
know
that
that's
unreliable
information,
and
then
the
prosecutor
stepped
up
after
that
information
was
presented
and
said
that
that
supported
the
fact
that
the
bank
of
nova
scotia
knew
that
this
was
an
illegal
tax
shelter
because
they'd
been
told
it
when
monty
smith,
who
was
the
president,
met
with
mr.
kilpatrick
in
denver.
so
you
have
a
clear
case
in
which
the
district
court
made
findings
after
listening
to
the
reason
of
the
agent,
after
listening
to
the
reasons
of
the
prosecutor,
that
they
had
knowingly
presented
misinformation,
that
they
seriously--
mr.
james
e.
nesland
--well,
we
certainly
did
not
know
whether
or
not
mr.
waters'
testimony
was
perjurious
from
his
point
of
view,
but
they
certainly
knew
that
it
was
unreliable,
and
yet
they
went
ahead.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
no.
the
difference...
the
distinction,
i
think,
between
what
your
question
is,
and
what
was
presented
in
costello,
and
the
cases
that
follow
costello,
is
that
the
government
there
presents
the
information,
it
doesn't
vouch
for
its
reliability,
and
it
doesn't
present
that
information
if
it
believes
it
is
unreliable.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
government
can
do
that
kind
of
thing
when
it
knows
what
it
is
doing.
the
mere
fact
that
it
happens,
that
is
governed,
we
submit,
by
the
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
the
question
there
was
not
whether
or
not
hearsay
testimony
was
or
was
not
reliable.
there
is
an
evidentiary
ground.
judge
learned
hand's
opinion
below
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
hearsay
testimony
presented
was
reliable,
was
persuasive,
of
the
charges.
it
simply
had
an
evidentiary
obstacle
to
it.
and
the
supreme
court
in
that
case
affirmed
judge
learned
hand's
opinion
saying
that
that
evidentiary
violation,
that
evidentiary
incompetency,
was
not
going
to
be
something
that
the
court
was
going
to
be
interested
in,
and
that
the
court
was
going
to
prevent
through
the
use
of
his
supervisory
authority.
but
the
court
was
not
presented
there
with
the
issue
here
as
to
whether
or
not
the
government
when
it
presents
misinformation,
and
when
it
knowingly
does
so,
should
not
be
held
to
a
different
standard,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
this
court
ought
to
exercise
its
supervisory
authority
to
prevent
that
kind
of
misconduct.
the
problem
you
have
in
the
grand
jury
context
is
that
the
probable
cause
standard
is
very
low
compared
to
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
criminal
trial,
so
that
prosecutors
know,
and
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
they
know,
that
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
establish
that
the
grand
jury's
decision
was
substantially
influenced
by
any
errors.
and
so
they
have
taken
from
that
the
idea,
and
it
was
argued
before
the
district
court
below,
that,
yes,
our
misconduct,
if
proven,
would
warrant
dismissal,
but
they
argue
that
is
only
if
you
don't
require
prejudice,
and
that's
only
if
you
would
use
your
supervisory
authority
as
other
circuits
do.
so
they
were
challenging...
they
were
trying
to
defend
their
very
misconduct
on
the
fact
that
you
can't
establish
prejudice
in
the
grand
jury
level.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
well,
the
court
of
appeals
was
concerned
with
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury,
and
that's
what
it
focused
on.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
well,
first
of
all,
the
government
never
conceded
at
any
point
along
the
line
that
there
was
any
prejudice.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
they
were
talking
about
whether
or
not
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury
was
infringed
by
their
misconduct
as
opposed
to
the
outcome
of
the
grand
jury
was
infringed.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
right.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit,
and
some
of
the
other
circuits,
focused
exclusively
on
whether
or
not
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury
is
infringed,
not
whether
or
not
the
outcome
of
the
grand
jury's
decision
is
influenced
substantially
or
otherwise
by
the
misconduct,
or
by
the
misinformation.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
that's
correct,
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
if
it
comes
out
of
a
grand
jury
that
is
not
independent?
mr.
james
e.
nesland
i
believe
that
would
be
one
taint,
yes.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
it
seems
to
me,
justice
scalia,
that
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
a
court
below,
the
district
courts,
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
should
be
able
to
look
at
the
misconduct,
and
to
be
able
to
deter
misconduct
that
reflects
upon
the
grand
jury
process,
that
reflects
upon
the
criminal
justice
system,
because
of
the
way
the
government
operates,
because
of
the
way
the
government
conducted
itself
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
these
particular
defendants
were
prejudiced
by
this
particular
activity.
it
seems
to
me
that's
what--
mr.
james
e.
nesland
--i
don't
believe
so
in
the
grand
jury
context
simply
because
it
is
virtually
impossible,
and
i
think
this
case
proves
it,
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
carry
the
burden
of
establishing
that
conduct,
no
matter
how
outrageous,
no
matter
how
flagrant,
no
matter
how
egregious,
would
ever
infringe
the
grand
jury's
independence,
would
ever
substantially
influence
its
outcome.
the
courts
of
appeals
that
the
government
may
find
comfort
in,
that
constantly
hold
that
absent
prejudice,
then
you
have
to...
you
can't
dismiss,
those
cases
uniformly
hold
that,
yes,
the
conduct
here
was
outrageous;
yes,
the
conduct
here
was
flagrant;
yes,
the
conduct
here
was
unlawful,
but
it
didn't
prejudice
the
defendants.
and
the
reason
that
happens
is
that
it
is
an
impossible
burden
to
carry.
and
i
submit
that
the
supervisory
authority
of
this
court
has
to
be
used
to
deter
misconduct.
you
simply
can't
allow
it
to
keep
going
on,
to
keep
going
on
and
on,
because
you
say,
well,
it
is
a
preliminary
step
to
process.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
because
the
body
of
law...
we
are
not
trying
to
create
here
a
new
body
of
law,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
we
are
trying
to
do
here
is
to
apply
a
body
of
law
that
exists
to
the
grand
jury
in
order
to
protect
the
criminal
justice
system,
in
order
to
protect
the
perception
that
the
grand
jury
process
is
fair.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
to
protect
it
from
this
kind
of
misconduct
because
there
is
nothing
else
to
protect
the
grand
jury
process,
and
respect
for
the
grand
jury
process,
except
this
kind
of
sanction.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
i'm
not
suggesting
they
should
discipline
these
people.
that
is
for
the
contempt
procedures,
and
other
kinds
of
alternative
remedies.
what
they
have
to
do
though,
and
i
am
suggesting
that
the
foundations
of
mcnabb,
mallory,
and
all
the
supervisory
authority
cases,
are
that
your
focus
is
not
upon
whether
these
particular
defendants
were
injured
by
the
conduct,
were
they
substantially
prejudiced
by
the
conduct,
but
whether
or
not
the
public
perception,
and
the
respect
for
the
judicial
process
for
the
grand
jury
process,
is
nullified,
is
put
into
disrespect,
if
you
constantly
say,
well,
yes,
the
government's
conduct
was
outrageous;
yes,
it
was
egregious,
but
the
grand
jury
just
finds
probable
cause
anyway,
and
you
can't
prejudice
it,
so
why
bother.
i
suggest
that
the
grand
jury
is
an
essential
institution.
it
is
embodied
in
the
fifth
amendment,
and
you
can't
treat
it
so
cavalierly.
you
can't
mistreat
it
by
saying
that
because
they
are
only
finding
probable
cause
it
makes
no
difference.
the
historic
purpose
of
the
grand
jury
was
to
stand
between
the
accused
and
the
government.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
well,
the
causal
link
is
that
it's
the
kind
of
misconduct
that
is
intended
to
prejudice
the
grand
jury;
it
is
intended
to
influence;
it
is
intended
to
misuse
this
process.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
the
problem
with
the
rule
as
it
exists
today
in
the
circuits,
except
for
the
second
circuit,
and
perhaps
the
d.c.
circuit,
and
eleventh
circuit,
is
that
success,
or
that
failure...
excuse
me...
failure
is
success.
if
you
fail
in
your
assault
on
the
grand
jury,
you
are
successful
after
the
indictment
because
no
matter
what
you
did,
you
still
got
your
indictment.
and
i
submit
that
the
deterrence
to
misconduct
is
sponsored
by
that
kind
of
opinion,
by
that
kind
of
decision.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
well,
i
would
suggest
that
the
standard
was
the
one
that
you
articulated
in
your
concurring
opinion.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
in
mechanik.
and
that
is--
mr.
james
e.
nesland
--let
me
answer
that
two
ways.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
i'm
not
sure
if
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
exercised
that
standard,
it
would
have
come
to
a
different
conclusion
or
not.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
no.
it
applied
a
standard
which
looked
exclusively
to--
mr.
james
e.
nesland
--infringement
of
the
independence.
for
example,
a
number
of
the
findings
that
the
court
of
appeals
considered
was
whether
or
not
activity
occurred
within
or
outside
the
grand
jury,
so
it
never
focused
on
findings
below,
for
example,
that
there
was
misuse
of
the
grand
jury
process
to
prejudice
these
defendants.
they
said,
well,
how
could
that
prejudice
the
grand
jury
since
it
happened
outside
the
grand
jury,
so
that
you
had
that
problem.
they
also
accepted
the
costello
argument
that
you
don't
look
behind
what
happened
in
the
grand
jury,
so
that
the
government
in
this
case
was
able
to
knowingly
bring
in
seven
witnesses.
they
knew
they
weren't
going
to
testify;
they
knew
they
were
going
to
invoke
their
fifth;
he
did
it
simply
to
put
it
on
the
record,
and
the
court
below
found
that
that
prejudiced
the
grand
jury.
it
brought
impermissible
inferences
into
the
grand
jury.
the
court
of
appeals
says
"we
don't
care".
that
only
focuses
on
the
culpability
of
the
prosecutors,
and
that's
not
the
purpose
of
prejudice.
the
purpose
of
prejudice
is
determined
by
the
impact
on
the
grand
jury.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
james
e.
nesland
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect
to
the
questions
of
justice
stevens,
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
government
spends
virtually
half
of
its
brief
relitigating
the
findings
below.
and
i
suggest
if
the
government
is
entitled
to
relitigate
the
findings
of
misconduct,
we're
entitled
to
relitigate
whether
or
not
there
was
prejudice.
we
disbelieve
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
made
that
determination,
in
the
same
manner
that
they
contend
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
properly
reach
their
findings
with
respect
to
the
deliberate,
purposeful,
and
intentional
violations
of
law
and
standards
of
conduct
in
this
case.
i
would
suggest
that
the
harmless
error
rule
is
not
sensitive
to
the
problem
in
the
grand
jury
context.
to
preserve
respect
for
this
grand
jury,
and
all
grand
juries,
and
to
deter
misuse
of
the
grand
jury
process,
this
court
simply
cannot
rely
exclusively
upon
harmless
error
because
the
answer
of
the
government
will
always
be
as
they
argued
below,
as
they
argue
in
all
of
the
circuits,
yes,
you
found
misconduct;
yes,
it
was
flagrant;
yes,
it
was
egregious;
yes,
it
was
outrageous,
but
it
didn't
prejudice
you
in
the
grand
jury's
decision-making
charge.
and
i
submit
that
this
court
should
not
sponsor
that
perception
of
the
grand
jury
system,
and
the
criminal
justice
system.
thank
you.
