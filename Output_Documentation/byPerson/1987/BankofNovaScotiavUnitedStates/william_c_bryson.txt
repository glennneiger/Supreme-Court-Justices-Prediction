mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
harmless
error
case.
the
general
principle
in
this
court's
harmless
error
cases
is
that
you
don't
reverse
a
criminal
conviction,
or
dismiss
an
indictment
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
of
prejudice.
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
that
general
principle
is
applicable
to
this
case.
now,
the
petitioners
are
contending
that
this
case
is
a
case
which
fits
into
that
small
class
of
cases
in
which
the
court
had
said
the
dismissal
is
appropriate
without
a
specific
showing
of
prejudice.
it
is
settled,
and
i
think
this
is
an
answer...
i
give
the
same
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
as
the
petitioners
did,
it
is
settled
that
for
purposes
of
this
case
we
have
to
assume
that
there
was,
in
fact,
no
prejudice
shown
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
the
standard
for
prejudice
is
was
there
an
effect
on
the
charging
decision;
that
is
to
say--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
is
correct,
we
do.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we
believe
they
did.
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
an
effect
on
the
charging
decision
at
several
points
in
its
opinion.
it
referred
to
effects--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
don't
recall
whether
they
used
the
term
grave
doubt
in
point--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--they
made
clear
that
what
they
were
looking
at
is
was
there
an
effect
on
the
charging
decision.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
so.
it
may
well
be,
as
is
true
at
trial.
a
single
error,
or
even
two
errors,
would
independently...
or
five
errors,
would
not
independently
result
in
prejudice
to
a
defendant,
but
cumulatively
the
errors
can
result
in
prejudice.
the
same
thing
could
apply
in
the
grand
jury
setting.
here,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
there
was
no
prejudice
from
any
single
error,
or
cumulatively,
and
that
finding
is
settled
for
purposes
of
this
litigation
at
this
point.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
your
honor,
we
think
that
there
were
errors.
you
can
put
the
term
misconduct
on
it.
i
think
there
were
errors.
for
example,
i
think
it
was
improper.
you
can
call
it
misconduct
for
the
prosecutor
to
engage
in
an
argument
with
an
expert
witness,
which
occurred
after
the
grand
jury
proceeding
of
the
morning
it
concluded,
but
nonetheless
occurred
during
a
lunch
break
in
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
you
could
call
it
misconduct.
i
don't
think--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
that
is
probably
the
one
incident
in
which...
which
is
not
subject
to
an
explanation
other
than
it
is
simply
a
flat
error
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
there
are
a
couple
of
things.
first
of
all,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
no
6(e)
violation
in
this
case.
our
position
all
along
has
been
that
what
the
agents
did
in
going
out,
gather
evidence,
was
perfectly
consistent
with
their
responsibilities
in
rule
6(e),
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
there
is
another
point
which
was
the
letters
that
were
sent
out
to
people
that
were
believed
not
to
be
in
the
grand
jury
subpoena
power,
which
indicated
that
there
was
an
ongoing
grand
jury
investigation,
and
the
subject
of
that
grand
jury
investigation.
we
believe
that
was
not
error.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
resolve
that
question.
the
district
court
found
that
to
be
error.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
there
was
an
extensive
investigation
by...
internal
investigation
by
the
office
of
professional
responsibility.
their
conclusion
was
that
there
were
some
errors,
most
pointedly,
for
example,
the
argument
with
the
expert
witness,
and
the
violation
of
rule
6(d)
for
having
the
two
agents
together
reading
testimony
at
the
same
time,
but
they
concluded
that
these
were
not
major
significant
errors
that
justified
serious
sanctions,
and
they
concluded
that,
in
fact,
the
fact
that
the
prosecutors
had
been
sharply
criticized
in
published
judicial
opinions
was
sanction
enough.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we
certainly
think
so.
and,
in
fact,
we
think
that
not
only
are
there
adequate
sanctions,
but
we
believe
that
in
this
case
the
sanctions
that
the
system
has
imposed
have
been
more
than
enough
to
deter
conduct
like
this.
these
people
have
been
given
a
very
long
and
unpleasant
ride
through
the
judicial
system,
and
they
have
been
investigated
not
only
by
the
office
of
professional
responsibility,
but
also
by
the
local
bar
associations,
which
also
have
found
no
cause
for
sanctions,
but
they
have
been
subject
to
those
investigations.
those
are
very
real
sanctions
that
are
imposed
directly
on
the
attorneys
as
opposed
to
imposed
on
the
case,
or
on
society,
through
dismissal
of
a
case.
there
is
a
further
sanction
which
was
not
employed
in
this
case,
but
which
is
available
under
rule
6(e),
and
under
general
contempt
power
of
the
court.
if
the
court
feels
that
there
are
willful
violations
of
court
rules,
the
court
can
impose
contempt.
that
was
not
done
in
this
case,
but
that
is
an
available
sanction,
and
we
think
those
sanctions
are
adequate.
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
your
honor.
if
i
can
explain
the
factual
background
of
this.
this
gets
into
the
facts
of
the
case,
which
i
don't
think
are
really
necessary
to
resolution
of
the
case
at
this
point,
but
i
want
to
try
to
clear
that
up
because
there
has
been
a
lot
of
confusion
about
what
the
exact
status
of
mendrop's
testimony
was,
and
whether
this
was
misleading,
or
perjurious,
or
whatever.
mendrop
testified
at
the
end
of
the
prosecution's
presentation
in
this
case,
and
the
prosecutor
said,
"now,
mr.
mendrop
will
summarize
for
you,
and
run
through
one
more
time
the
case.
"
mendrop
then
began
to
testify.
at
several
points
he
made
it
quite
clear
in
the
course
of
his
testimony
that
he
was
referring
and
relying
not
only
on
previous
evidence
that
had
been
actually
presented
to
the
grand
jury,
or
to
the
preceding
grand
jury,
but
to
his
own
interviews
with
witnesses
in
his
own
investigation,
which
he
had
conducted
outside
of
the
grand
jury
room.
mendrop
testified
at
one
point
that
the...
that
there
had
been
a
visit
by
this
fellow,
monty
smith,
from
the
bank
to
mr.
kilpatrick.
now,
the
claim
is
that
there
as
no
basis
for
that
testimony,
or
that
the
testimony
was
very
shakey.
but,
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
it
is
very
clear
what
happened.
prior
to
mendrop's
testimony
in
september
of
'82
there
had
been
some
doubt
as
to
whether
this
visit
occurred.
at
joint
appendix
88-89
there
is
an
explanation
of
what
happened.
the
prosecutor
sent
mendrop
back
to
double
check
this,
find
out
what
he
could
find
by
way
of
corroboration
of
that
evidence.
then
at
joint
appendix
189-190
mendrop
explained
to
the
grand
jury
there
was
this
visit.
waters,
who
didn't
testify,
but
who
was
questioned
by
mendrop,
waters
said
it
was
true.
the
chauffeur
said
it
was
true,
the
chauffeur
for
kilpatrick,
and,
in
fact,
kilpatrick
had
himself
said
it
was
true
when
he
told
waters.
and,
in
fact,
waters
later
testifies
at
the
obstruction
trial
against
kilpatrick
that
kilpatrick
did,
in
fact,
say
that
smith
visited
him.
we
submit
that
that
establishes
that
mendrop
had
plenty
basis.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
second
is
absolutely
clearly
erroneous
because
mendrop
simply
said
the
chauffeur
said
this
was
true,
and
in
relating
what
waters
had
said,
he
said
that
waters
had
said
that
kilpatrick
had
said
that
the
visit
had
occurred.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
don't
think
you
have
to
because
the
court
of
appeals
said...
while
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
resolve
the
question
as
to
whether
this
had...
the
source
of
mendrop's
evidence
was
misleading...
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
look
behind
the
district
court's
finding
that
the
grand
jury
was
misled
as
to
whether
mendrop's
evidence
came
from
prior
evidence
presented
to
the
grand
jury,
or
from
his
own
investigations.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
say,
and
this
is
it
pet
app,
i
think,
822,
no.
12,
was
that
there
was
no
perjured
testimony
inadvertent
or
knowing
presented
to
this
grand
jury,
and
that
was
enough
to
persuade
the
court
of
appeals
that
a)
there
was
nothing
that
would
justify
dismissal
in
this
case
under
the
costello
rule;
and
b)
that
there
was
no
unfair
misleading
of
the
grand
jury.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
gone
ahead
and
resolved
the
question,
which
we
asked
them
to
resolve,
as
to
whether,
in
fact,
the
district
court
was
simply
flat
wrong
as
to
its
characterization
of
the
events
dealing
with
that
visit,
but
that
wasn't
necessary
for
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
this
court
to
resolve
the
case.
i
think
that
point,
once
you
find...
at
least
once
you
find
that
there
is
no
intentional
perjured
testimony,
or
even
unintentional
perjured
testimony
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
that
resolves
the
case
under
costello,
resolves
that
claim.
now,
the
very
few
situations
in
which
this
court
has
said
that
there
is
no
need
for
specific
proof
of
harmless
error
are
those
situations...
excuse
me,
of
prejudicial
error...
are
those
situations
in
which,
as
the
court
has
said,
there
is
a
fundamental
error,
one,
that
undermines
confidence
in
the
whole
proceeding,
or
as
the
court
said
in
rose
v.
clark,
necessarily
renders
the
trial
fundamentally
unfair,
or
an
error
that
renders
the...
that
means
that
the
criminal
trial
cannot
reliably
serve
its
function
as
a
vehicle
for
determination
of
guilt
of
innocence.
those
errors
include,
and
are
in
the
main
limited
to
errors
such
as
complete
lack
of
counsel
at
trial,
bias
on
the
part
of
the
judge
of
the
fact
finder,
bias
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor,
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
grand
jurors,
or
petty
jurors.
this
case
is
simply
not
in
that
class.
this
is
a
case
which
if
you
look
at
these
errors
in
terms
of
what
effect
they
would
have
at
trial,
you
would
look
at
the
trial
and
say
"these
errors
can
be
assessed
for
their
prejudicial
impact,
they
have
to
be
assessed
for
their
prejudicial
impact.
"
and
you
would
conclude
that
they
were
either
non-prejudicial,
or
that
they
were
prejudicial
and
required
reversal.
that
is
exactly
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
treated
this
case.
and
that
we
submit
is
correct
under
the...
not
only
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
in
the
harmless
error
area,
but
also
under
the
two
non-case
law
authorities
that
we
cite.
one
is
the
statute,
the
harmless
error
statute,
28
usc
2111,
and
the
other
is
the
rule
of
criminal
procedure,
rule
52(a),
both
of
which
require
a
violation...
a
showing
of
prejudice
in
the
context
of
any
violation
to
grant
either
reversal
of
a
conviction,
or
a
dismissal
of
indictment.
the
district
court
dismissed
on
three
grounds
in
this
case.
first,
rule
6(d)
violations;
second,
rule
6(e)
violations;
and
third,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
including
the
6(d)
and
6(e)
violations.
now,
we
believe
that
this
court's
decision,
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
us,
in
mechanik,
resolved
the
first
two
points,
and
resolved
the
question
of
whether
violations
of
rule
6(d),
and
by
clear
implication
violations
of
rule
6(e),
are
violations
that
require
showing
of
prejudice,
and
that
are
subject
to
the
harmless
error
rule.
we
believe
the
court
clearly
accepted
that
proposition,
and
therefore,
the
district
court
is
clearly
wrong
in
dismissing
in
this
case
for
violations
of
6(d)
or
6(e)
in
the
absence
of
showing
of
prejudice.
now,
the
next
ground
is
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
as
we
have
argued,
we
think
that
you
can't
plug
into
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
either
6(d)
or
6(e),
and
get
any
more
mileage
out
of
them
than
you
can
by
reciting
them
as
bases
for
dismissal
separately,
unless,
of
course,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
they
somehow
add
to
all
of
the
prejudice
and
result
in
a
finding
of
prejudice.
but
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
neither
the
6(d)
nor
the
6(e)
violations
resulted
in
any
prejudice
at
all,
so
they
contribute
nothing
to
the
ultimate
conclusion.
now,
there
are
other
points
that
the
district
court
focused
on.
some
of
them
we
think
are
absolutely
lawful,
not
unlawful
at
all,
such
as
the
use
of
informal
immunity.
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that,
and
therefore
that
washes
out
all
together.
there
are
other
points
that
the
district
court
found
were
unlawful,
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
find
it
necessary
to
resolve,
but
we
submit
are
completely
lawful,
such
as
calling
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
who
invoke
their
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
and
while
there
is
some
suggestion
the
department
of
justice
policy
is
contrary
to
the
position
that
was
taken
in
this
case,
and
what
the
prosecutors
did,
in
fact,
department
of
justice
policy
authorizes,
except
in
the
case
of
targets,
calling
individuals
before
the
grand
jury
even
if
they
are
expected
to
invoke
their
fifth
amendment
privilege,
simply
to
determine
if
they,
in
fact,
are
going
to
invoke
their
privilege,
and
to
make
a
record
that
you
tried
to
get
evidence
from
that
particular
witness,
something
that
can
be
of
great
use
later
on
if
the
witness
decides
to
be
forthcoming
in
a
different
setting,
and
you
are
implicitly
or
explicitly
charged
with
not
having
really
done
your
homework
by
calling
the
witness
and
finding
out
what
he
had
to
say.
similarly,
while
we
admit
that
the
mistreatment
of
the
expert
witness
was
improper,
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
a)
there
was
no
prejudice
that
flowed
from
that;
and
b)
it
is
just
not
the
kind
of
error
that
could
possibly
be
sufficient
to
invoke
a
reversal
without
showing
of
prejudice
rule.
if
this
occurred,
for
example,
at
trial,
and
there
was
an
argument
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
witness,
which
happened
as
the
jurors
were
filing
out,
and
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
a
court
of
appeals
would
say
this
is
something
that
has
to
be
assessed
for
actual
impact
on
the
trial,
and
if
it
didn't
have
an
impact
on
the
trial,
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
it
reflects
badly
on
the
department.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
that
was
a
mistake,
and
i
wish
it
hadn't
happened,
and
i'm
sure
that
the
prosecutors
now
wish
that
it
hadn't
happened.
i
might
say
that
if
you
look
closely
at
the
evidence,
it
was
not
as
if
the
prosecutor
was
beating
this
fellow
with
a
stick.
this
was
a
law
professor
who
was
very
firm
in
his
views
of
what
the
law
was,
and
the
prosecutor,
and
the
law
professor,
got
into
what
amounts
to
a
little
bit
of
a
shouting
match.
it
didn't
last
very
long,
and
in
the
course
of
which
the
prosecutor
said,
"well,
i'll
see
you
in
court
on
that
one.
"
challenging
his
assertion
as
to
what
the
law
was
on
a
particular
point.
the
witness
took
umbrage
of
that
and
felt
that
he
was
threatening
him,
but
the
witness
later
said
that
he
did
not
feel
intimidated,
and
in
fact,
he
did
not
change
his
testimony
in
any
respect.
the
reply
brief
suggests
that
there
was
a
recantation
on
his
part,
but
there
was
not.
now,
they
attempt
to
get
around
the
general
principles
of
harmless
error
that
this
court's
decisions
have
set
forth,
and
that
rule
52(a)
and
section
2211
require,
by
invoking
the
magic
wand
of
the
supervisory
power.
but
we
submit
that
if
you
look
at
this
court's
recent
cases
in
the
area
of
harmless
error,
and
supervisory
power
in
the
inner
section
of
those
two
documents,
you
can't
find
support
for
their
submission.
the
payner
case...
it's
an
important
case
in
this
line...
establishes
that
where
the
exercise
of
the
supervisory
power,
as
here,
is
invoked
in
order
to
deter
misconduct
that
was
engaged
in
in
bad
faith,
and
payner
was
the
ultimate
bad
faith
misconduct
case,
it
is
improper
to
apply
the
supervisory
powers
to
dismiss
an
indictment
where
the
exclusionary
rule
would
not
have
required
suppression
or
dismissal.
the
morrison
case,
similarly,
again
invocation
of
a
power
to
dismiss
because
of
bad
faith
misconduct.
no
question
that
it
was
bad
faith
conduct.
but
once
again,
the
court
said
you
can't
dismiss
for
deterrence
purposes
without
a
showing
of
prejudice.
the
hasting
case,
again
repeated
misconduct.
the
court
of
appeals,
seventh
circuit,
felt
that
there
had
been
repeated
instances
of
the
violation
in
that
case
in
the
circuit,
and
wanted
to
do
something
about
it
by
way
of
deterrence.
once
again,
the
supreme
court
said
that
there
was
no
basis
in
the
law
under
the
supervisory
power,
or
otherwise,
for
ignoring
the
question
of
prejudice.
and
finally,
in
rose
against
clark,
the
court
reiterated,
and
summarized
this
line
of
cases,
by
saying
there
is
a
strong
presumption
that
errors
other
than
this
very
small
class
of
errors
that
really
taint
the
entire
process
from
beginning
to
end,
and
make
it
impossible
to
assess
the
possibility
of
prejudice.
there
is
a
strong
presumption
that
other
errors
are
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis,
and
that's
our
submission
in
this
case,
that
this
case
falls
into
the
large
group
of
cases
that
are
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis,
and
not
into
the
very
small
group
of
cases
that
are
not
subject
to
that
analysis--
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
