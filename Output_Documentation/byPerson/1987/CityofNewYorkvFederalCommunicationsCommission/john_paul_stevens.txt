justice
stevens
mr.
mcgrath,
will
you
help
me
with
one
thing?
i've
got
a
little
lost
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
what
is
the
statutory
provision
on
which
the
commission
relies
for
its
authority
to
adopt
the
regulations.
justice
stevens
and
that's
the
sole
authority
that
they
rely
on,
624(e)?
justice
stevens
but
you
think
they
rely
exclusively
on
624(e)?
justice
stevens
mr.
mcgrath,
why
is
that
so?
i
mean,
subsection
(b)
includes
things
like
quality
of
operator
service
which
i
guess
means
whether
maintenance
people
would
come
in,
and
so
forth,
and
you
don't
have
to
have
any
standards
on
that.
the
response
to
consumer
complaints,
you
don't
have
standards
on
that.
and
billing
practices,
there
are
no
standards
on
that.
why
couldn't
they
make
findings
dealing
with
each
of
these
subjects
without
any
standards
saying
what
the
maximum
or
minimum
was?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
this
means
by
the
same
argument
that
the
fcc
must
promulgate
regulations
dealing
with
billing
practices
and
how
to
respond
to
consumer
complaints?
justice
stevens
you
mean
the
local.
but
they
are
to
the
extent
consistent
with
the
title,
and
i
suppose
with
regulations
promulgated
by
the
fcc
pursuant
to
the
title.
you
don't
claim
a
right
to
promulgate
inconsistent
regulations?
justice
stevens
and
if
there's
a
regulation
out
there
that
says,
there
shall
be
no
regulation
in
this
area
because
we
want
the
free
market
to
set
the
standards,
then
it's
inconsistent
with
the
regulation.
justice
stevens
well,
but
if
they
have
the
power...
where
do
they
get
the
power
to
issue.
you
said
you
think
they
only
get
the
power
from
the
1984
statute,
don't
you?
justice
stevens
why
is
it
then
that
their
order
reads,
as
an
amendment
of
the
preexisting
'72
rules
rather
than
as
a
brand
new--
it
seems
to
be
we're
relying
on
preexisting
authority
as
well
as--
justice
stevens
--but
if
that
statute--
justice
stevens
--now,
why
is
that
improper?
is
there
anything
in
here
that
repeals
the
prior
statute?
justice
stevens
well,
do
you
contend
that
the
'72
regulations
were
invalid,
also?
justice
stevens
you
take
the
position
that
unless
affirmative
authority
for
an
fcc
regulation
can
be
found
in
the
cable
act
of
'84,
it
has
no
such
authority
to
regulate
in
this
area?
justice
stevens
yes,
mr.
wallace,
but
is
it
not
true
that
your
theory
might
make
a
difference,
does
it
depend
on
the
existence
of
some
federal
standard,
there's
some
minimal
federal
standard
under
title
i
for
title
i
but
not
under
titles
ii,
iii
and
iv,
isn't
that
the
point?
justice
stevens
and
the
question
i
have
in
my
mind
is
whether
we
agree
with
you
on
title
i,
do
we
just
leave
open
the
question
on
title
ii,
iii
and
iv,
or
will
we
necessarily
have
decided
that?
justice
stevens
i'm
not
questioning
about
the
remand
but
the
question
i
have
is
whether
without
promulgating
any
technical
standards
at
all,
could
the
fcc
under
the
statute
say
we
think
the
best
way
to
achieve
quality
signals
and
all
the
rest
of
it
is
by
letting
the
free
market
have
full
play,
and
simply
say,
we
will
promulgate
none,
and
we
forbid
the
states
and
franchises.
justice
stevens
but
my
question
is
whether
you
would
still
make
the
same
legal...
because
if
you're
right
on
that,
this
is
an
awfully
easy
case.
but
i
don't
know
whether
you're
really
arguing
that
or
not.
justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
statutory
authority
which
i
think
is
the
bottom
line
here
for
the
regulation.
as
i
understand
your
argument
thus
far,
you
rely
exclusively
on
624(e),
the
section
that
deals
with
the
situation
where
the
commission
has
promulgated
standards.
and
as
i
also
understand
it,
under
titles
ii,
iii
and
iv,
there
were
no
federal
standards,
and
the
commission
still
asserted
the
authority
to
preempt
in
the
same
way.
and
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
statutory
authority
for
that
position
was,
because
if
that's
valid,
it
would
seem
to
me
this
case
would
a
fortiori.
can
you
tell
me
that?
would
rather
do
it
in
one
bite
rather
than
two.
you're
going
to
be
back
up
here
for
ii,
iii
and
iv,
anyway,
if
it's
all
that
clear,
make
a
clean
sweep
of
it.
justice
stevens
i
still
would
like
an
answer
to
the
question,
if
there
is
one.
justice
stevens
302
is
a
section
of
the
'84
act?
justice
stevens
okay,
so
that
you
do
contend
that
we
need
not
look
entirely
to
the
'84
act
in
order
to
find
the
statutory--
justice
stevens
--i
understand
that.
but
i'm
trying
to
find
out,
if
we
disagreed
on
that,
to
what
extent
do
you
think
it
is
appropriate
to
go
to
an
earlier
statute
to
find
authority.
justice
stevens
and
therefore
the
'84
act
did
not
withdraw
any
authority
that
previously
existed
under
your
view?
justice
stevens
mr.
farr,
do
you
think
they
could
do
that
if
the
federal
standards
were
withdrawn
entirely?
justice
stevens
they
would
withdraw
them
but
continue
to
preempt?
justice
stevens
and
would
you
agree
with
mr.
wallace
the
power
is
still
derived
from
624(e)?
justice
stevens
even
if
there
is
no
federal
standard,
just
the
power
to
preempt
all
standards
and
say
the
free
market
shall
be
the
only
standard?
