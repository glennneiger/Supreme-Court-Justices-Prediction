mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
historically,
the
commission
applied
technical
standards
requirements
to
so-called
class
one
channels
which
are
channels
used
to
deliver
broadcast
signals
of
television
stations
because
that
was
the
clearest
authority
that
the
commission
had
under
the
ancillary
jurisdiction
doctrine
of
the
southwestern
cable
case.
the
commission
began
to
regulate
in
this
area
before
congress
enacted
any
statute
dealing
specifically
with
cable
casting.
because
the
technical
standards
that
the
commission
adopted
were
principally
focused
on
the
signal
both
visual
and
oral
that
the
worst
located
subscriber
would
actually
receive
on
his
set,
and
because
the
other
classes
of
cable
were
coming
through
the
same
system,
the
standards
for
class
i
channels
tended
also
to
control
the
quality
of
signals
for
the
other
classes.
and
for
that
reason,
the
commission
never
did
adopt
standards
specifically
with
respect
to
the
other
classes.
but
it
is
now
considering
that
question
on
remand
in
this
case.
we
did
not
raise
any
question
about
the
correctness
of
that
remand.
the
question
that
the
petitioners
have
presented
with
respect
to
the
commission's
authority
to
prescribe
maximum
standards
for
class
i
channels
will
necessarily
have
a
spillover
effect
to
what
the
commission
can
do
about
the
other
classes
of
channels.
so
they're
is
a
relationship
there
regardless
of
whether
technically
the
other
classes
are
before
the
court
on
this
petition.
the
regulation
that
is
at
issue
here--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
had
not
understood
them
to
be
before
the
court
except
in
the
spillover
effect
that
would
necessarily
occur
from
the
decision
here.
the
fcc
regulation
that
is
at
issue
explicitly
prohibits
local
franchising
authorities
from
enforcing
more
stringent
technical
standards
for
cable
casters
than
the
standards
that
the
fcc
has
prescribed.
after
the
standards
are
set
out
on
the
preceding
pages,
then
on
page
87
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
commission
regulation
is
quite
explicit
that
these
rule
sections
or
less
stringent
versions
of
them
may
be
used
as
standards
by
state
or
local
regulatory
authorities,
no
technical
parameter
in
excess
of
the
above
rule
sections
may
be
required.
and
the
way
local
authorities
require
standards
is
through
the
franchising
process
or
the
renewal
process
in
the
franchise
agreements.
so
there's
no
doubt
that
the
commission's
intent,
as
its
report
and
order
explain
unmistakably
as
well,
was
to
prevent
the
local
authorities
from
enforcing
more
stringent
standards
on
the
cable
casters.
and
this
case
therefore
presents
no
occasion
to
consider
guides
to
interpretation
that
the
court
has
adverted
to
in
other
cases
that
would
disfavor
preemption
when
there's
some
ambiguity
about
whether
preemption
was
intended.
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
this
regulation
exceeds
the
scope
of
the
commission's
statutory
authority.
we
do
not
claim
that
the
statute
itself
accomplished
this
preemption
of
more
stringent
standards
or
that
the
statute
required
the
commission
to
preempt
local
authority
in
this
way--
and
in
this
respect,
the
case
is
similar
to
the
capital
cities
against
crisp
case
in
which
the
preemption
flowed
entirely
from
the
commission's
regulation
adopted
in
the
exercise
of
its
broad
authority
to
further
the
national
communications
policy
and
not
from
anything
in
the
statute,
which
at
that
time
didn't
even
refer
to
cable
casting.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
agree
with
it
entirely,
mr.
justice,
with
the
possible
exception
that
it
starts
off
saying
the
commission
may
establish
technical
standards.
so
that
the
discretion
is
in
the
commission
whether
to
establish
the
technical
standards.
and
what
has
been
remanded
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
this
case
is
the
question
of
whether
the
commission
could
preclude
local
authorities
from
establishing
their
own
technical
standards
with
respect
to
classes
ii,
iii
and
iv,
if
the
commission
has
not
established
any
technical
standards.
and
of
course
that
could
be
resolved
by
just
having
the
commission
establish
some
technical
standards.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
directly,
no,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
you
do
leave
it
open
because
we
did
not
petition
from
the
remand.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
what
the
commission
did
with
respect
to
ii,
iii
and
iv,
and
we
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
could
do
that,
and
they
said
not
without
explaining
how
that
relates
to
the
franchising
process.
and
now
the
commission
is
reconsidering
that,
so
we're
making
no
contention
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we're
not
arguing
it
that
way
because
that
question
is
back
before
the
commission
and
the
commission
has
not
spoken
yet.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
on
class
i,
the
commission
has
prescribed
technical
standards
within
the
meaning
of
624(e)
on
page
118
of
the
appendix,
which
says,
the
commission
may
establish
technical
standards.
the
commission
has
established
technical
standards
for
class
i,
and
those
are
the
standards
which
it
has
said
a
franchising
authority
may
require.
and
that's
how
we
can
win
on
class
i.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
we
have
not
argued
that
in
this
court.
that
is
what
is
on
remand.
in
this
court,
we
have
argued
that
the
commission
has
established
standards
and
said
that
class
i
and
said
that
the
local
franchising
authorities
may
not
exceed
them
in
requiring
standard
policy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
forum
of
the
regulation
that
is
before
the
court
here
is
a
form
that
includes
an
explicit
preemption
provision
but
that
form
is
encountered
in
a
situation
where
a
federal
agency
has
concluded
that
certain
options
should
be
preserved
for
the
regulated
industry.
in
that
respect,
this
case
is
like
fidelity
federal
savings
against
de
la
cuesta
where
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
concluded
that
federal
savings
and
loan
associations
should
be
allowed
the
option
to
use
due
on
sale
clauses
if
they
wished.
they
didn't
want
to
require
them
to
use
them
so
the
only
way
to
preserve
the
option
unambiguously
was
to
say
that
the
option
cannot
be
taken
away
by
state
regulatory
authority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if,
it
would
depend
on--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
would
depend
on
if
the
commission
told
cable
casters,
these
are
the
standards
that
you
must
use,
and
you
can't
deviate
from
them
up
or
down,
then
that
would
preclude
a
requirement
that
would
require
them--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--then
that
would
leave
an
ambiguity
which
is
not
present
in
this
case,
and
might
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
fcc
did
not
mean
to
preempt
local
authority
from
applying
a
more
stringent
standard.
but
here--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
to
encourage
the
development
of
the
cable
industry
including
in
the
competitive
environment,
yes.
but
also
to
encourage
technological
change.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
what
the
commission's
reports
and
orders,
both
in
'74
and
in
'85
said
is
that
we're
dealing
with
a
national
market
for
this
equipment.
and
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
competition
in
the
particular
community.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
can
be
competitive
applicants
for
renewal,
but
one
of
the
things
that
the
'84
act
did
was
to
limit
the
discretion
of
local
authorities
to
deny
renewals.
it
put
in
safeguards
for
the
renewal
applicant
that
did
not
previously
exist.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
could
not.
it
could
not
if
the
renewal
applicant
is
meeting
the
standards
prescribed
by
the
commission.
what
the
reports
and
orders
in
both
'74
when
the
commission
first
imposed
nationwide
technical
standards,
and
in
'85
when
the
commission
concluded
that
it
needed
to
prescribe
a
standard
that
could
not
be
exceeded
in
requirements
imposed
by
local
authorities,
what
these
reports
emphasized
was
that
a
multiplicity
of
standards
would
cause
cost
inefficiencies
in
the
industry.
and
if
some
of
the
larger
wealthier
systems
were
to
move
the
industry
to
more
expensive
equipment,
this
could
cause
problems
of
cost
ineffectiveness
for
small
systems
that
may
have
only
one
or
two
thousand
subscribers
and
might
not
be
able
to
get
less
expensive
equipment.
and
there
was
a
great
problem
with
rapid
technological
innovation
in
the
development
of
equipment
that
standards
might
be
prescribed
in
ways
that
would
make
technological
innovations
not
meet
the
standards.
and
by
the
time
of
the
'85
report
and
order,
there
were
more
than
18,500
local
jurisdictions
with
franchising
authority,
and
a
diversity
of
standards
that
would
have
to
be
changed
in
order
to
accommodate
technological
innovations,
and
it
might
be
conflicting
with
one
another,
would
impede
the
development
of
cable
casting
and
the
ability
of
cable
casting
on
a
nationwide
basis
to
compete
with
other
technologies.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
local
system
concluded
that
notwithstanding
these
200,000
complaints
the
cable
system
is
in
fact
complying
with
the
fcc
standards,
then
its
only
option
would
be
to
go
to
the
agency
and
say
these
standards
are
inadequate.
but
that
would
be
a
an
implausible
conclusion
to
reach.
they
might
reach
it.
and
the
reason
it
would
be
implausible
is
because
the
standards
don't
vary
from
locality
to
locality
and
they're,
they're,
what
they
prescribe--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but
the
standards
are
defined
in
terms
of
what
the
subscriber
will
receive,
the
poorest
located
subscriber,
and
because
the
signal
is
coming
through
cable,
it
isn't
affected
by
terrain
or
configuration
of
buildings,
so
that
if
complaints
were
to
be
received
in
one
place,
comparable
complaints
presumably
would
be
received
elsewhere.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
main
thrust
of
the
standards.
to
some
extent,
it
also
defines
standards
for
transmission
but
the
main
thrust
of
it,
and
what
the
standards
are
designed
to
assure
is
an
acceptable
quality
of
picture
and
of
sound
on
the
screen
of
every
subscriber
including
the
most
poorly
situated,
the
one
farthest
from
the
head
end,
and
the
standards
are
all
directed
toward
that.
so
it
would
be
implausible
that
one
community
would
be
having
problems
that
others
wouldn't,
if
the
standards
were
being
met.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
necessarily,
because
the
commission,
you
might
adopt
standards,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
one
answer
is
624(e)
itself
could
be
interpreted
to
say
that
the
commission
could
decide
that
zero
is
the
technical
standard
that
may
be
required
in
the
franchise.
another
possibility
is
to
refer
back
to
authority
under
the
communications
act
itself
and
the
broad
standards.
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
in
this
case
for
the
court
to
resolve
whether
the
commission
retains
authority
to
deal
with
cable
casting
apart
from
the
provisions
of
the
'84
act.
although
we
think
the
answer
to
that
is
probably,
yes,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
particularly
to
page
79
and
following
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
since
the
commission
is
still
applying
to
cable
casters
signal
leakage
limitations
which
the
commission
enforces
itself.
and
those
have
historically
been
based
on
section
302
of
the
cable
act
which
gives
the
commission
authority
to
regulate
devices
that
interfere
with
radio
reception.
and
the
commission
is
particularly
concerned
about
leakage
from
cable
systems
that
interfere
with
airplane
communications.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
it
is
a
section
of
the
'34
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
well,
we
think
the
'84
act
suffices
of
purposes
of
what's
before
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
think
the
authority
is
there
as
it
was
there
for
the
'74
report
and
order.
we
think
that
the
congress
did
not
in
any
way
disapprove
of
the
preemptive
order
that
the
commission
had
issued
in
'74.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
however,
the
main
thing
is
that
the
'84
act
mirrors
what
the
commission
had
developed
as
the
difference
between
its
jurisdiction
over
technical
standards
and
the
local
authorities'
jurisdiction
over
facilities
and
equipment
is
elaborately
developed
in
the
commission's
regulations,
and
the
same
terminological
breakdown
was
explicitly
used
in
the
'84
act.
