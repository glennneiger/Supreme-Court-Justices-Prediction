chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-339,
the
city
of
new
york,
city
of
miami,
city
of
wheaton
and
national
league
of
cities
versus
the
federal
communications
commission.
mr.
mcgrath,
you
may
begin
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
will
you
tell
us
where
do
you
think
625
is
and
what
exact
sentence
it
is
you're
quoting
from
so
we
can
follow
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
625(a)(1)
appears
to
be
on
page
120
of
the
appendix.
chief
justice
rehnquist
oh.
so
we're
now
on
renewal
in
your
argument?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
just
a
very
strange...
here's
how
the
sentence
reads:
the
fcc
may
establish
technical
standards
relating
to
the
facilities
and
equipment
of
cable
systems
which
a
franchising
authority
may
require
in
the
franchise.
you
think
it's
perfectly
logical
to
read
that
as
relating
as
to
mean
only
that
the
franchising
authority
may
require
the
facilities
and
equipment
to
be
in
the
franchise?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we'll
continue
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
mcgrath.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcgrath,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcgrath.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
what
about
the
renewal
procedure?
supposing
that
new
york
city
has
given
a
franchise
and
they've
got
300,000
people
and
at
the
time
of
renewal,
200,000
subscribers
say,
these
signals
are
awful,
it's
all
snow.
can
the
franchisee
say,
well,
you
can't
go
into
that
franchiser
because
they
haven't
shown
we
haven't
complied
with
the
minimum
standards
of
the
fcc?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
standards
prove
to
produce
snow
in
every
locality?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
the
standards
are
described
in
terms
of
what
the
person
sees
on
their
set?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
farr.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farr.
mr.
mcgrath,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcgrath.
the
case
is
submitted.
