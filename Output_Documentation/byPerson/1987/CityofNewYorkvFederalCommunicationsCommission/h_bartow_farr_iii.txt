mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
commission
has
indicated,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
different
from
the
issue
in
the
usual
preemption
case
that
comes
before
the
court,
because
here
there
is
an
express
statement
by
the
commission
that
it
intends
to
preempt
local
regulations.
the
basic
question
then
is
the
question
that
the
court
has
been
discussing
which
is,
what
is
the
scope
of
the
commission's
authority
under
the
cable
act?
is
it
broad
enough
in
fact
to
allow
the
commission
to
issue
the
regulations
that
it
has.
we
think
that
the
authority
is
broad
enough,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
commission
was
specifically
given
authority
in
section
624(e)
to
establish
technical
standards.
and
there
are
no
limitations
in
that
grant
of
authority.
we
think
that
language
is
broad
enough
not
just
to
give
the
commission
the
power
to
pick
some
numbers,
which
seems
to
be
the
interpretation
that
the
cities
argue
for,
but
a
power
also
to
consider
the
policies
that
go
together
within
picking
the
numbers.
now,
the
commission,
i
think
everybody
concedes
could
have
established
more
detailed
or
more
stringent
standards
than
the
ones
it
did.
but
what
it
decided
as
a
matter
of
federal
policy
is
that
the
best
way
to
serve
the
goals
to
encourage
better
technology
and
to
keep
the
cost
of
cable
services
reasonable
was
not
to
have
any
additional
regulation,
but
in
fact
to
let
the
industry
itself
develop
the
standards
that
would
achieve
those
goals.
now,
obviously,
to
suit
that
policy,
there
must
be
preemption
of
additional
local
standards.
otherwise,
in
fact,
the
policy
couldn't
be
carried
out.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
they
are
performance
standards
that
involve
obviously
a
technical
component.
and
the
question
for
the
industry
of
course
is
what
kinds
of
facilities
and
equipment
will
meet
those
particular
performance
standards.
i
think
that
is
what
the
commission
has
aimed
at.
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
technical
regulation,
there
is
a
ten-year
period
of
course
where
the
commission
has
followed
exactly
the
same
policy
before
the
cable
act
as
it
now
is
pushing
in
the
same,
in
the
regulations
since
then.
before
that,
however,
from
1972
to
1974,
the
commission
followed
exactly
the
policies
the
cities
would
like
it
to
have
to
follow
now.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
i'm
sorry.
it's
from
'72
to
'74,
that's
right.
and
then
in
'74,
they
changed
the
regulations
and
followed
them
that
way
for
a
decade.
but
from
'72
to
'74,
they
had
just
this
policy
that
the
cities
are
arguing
for
where
they
imposed
minimum
standards
and
allowed
the
cities
to
go
above
those
standards
and
impose
whatever
technical
standards
they
wanted.
and
in
'74,
the
commission
came
back
to
the
issue
and
said,
this
has
been
a
disaster.
what
is
happening
is
that
we
are
having
inconsistent
regulations.
the
cities
are
competing
with
each
other
to
outdo
each
other
in
these
requirements
and
the
opposite
of
what
we
hoped
would
happen
is
happening.
the
cost
is
going
up,
and
technology
is
being
stifled.
so
it
changed
its
regulations
and
for
ten
years
prior
to
the
cable
act,
followed
a
policy
of
preemption.
now,
the
particular
argument
that
the
cities
make,
therefore,
if
you
look
at
it
carefully,
would
mean
that
what
congress
did
in
1984
is
it
said
to
the
commission,
you
cannot
follow
the
policy
that
you've
been
following
for
ten
years...
ten
years
where
the
technology
of
cable
expanded
enormously,
and
you
must
go
back
to
a
policy
that
you
tried
for
two
years,
and
gave
up
on
as
a
failure.
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
act,
and
particularly
section
624,
which
deals
with
these
matters,
there
simply
is
not
any
indication
that
congress
intended
to
do
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
of
course,
624
does
not
make
any
specific
reference
to
technical
standards.
and
i
think
what
essentially
624
and
624(b)
and
(e)
do
put
together
is
to
essentially
have
the
same
structure
that
the
fcc
regulations
have.
the
fcc
didn't
try
to
regulate
many
aspects
of
facilities
and
equipment,
like
safety
codes
and
things
like
that,
whether
they
met
fire
codes.
they
did
regulate
this
one
area
of
technical
standards,
and
i
think
the
language
fairly
tracks
that.
now,
i
would
just
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
point
about
renewal
that
has
been
made
several
times
here,
because
i
think
the
cities
have
said,
referring
not
to
624,
but
to
section
626,
that
they
really
can't
have
a
renewal
process
unless
they
have
their
own
standards.
and
i
don't
think
that
that's
so.
first
of
all,
there
are
the
fcc
standards.
so
if
you
are
looking
for
a
set
of
objective
standards,
the
fcc
standards
are
ones
that
cities
can
use
in
their
franchises.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
that
points
up
one
of
the
differences
here.
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
power
of
the
commission
essentially
to
establish
regulations
and
to
make
them
preemptive
which
i
think
is
what
this
case
is
about.
i
think
there
is
a
separate
issue
which
is
whether
these
standards
are
adequate
standards
for
the
purposes
that
the
cities
would
like
to
use
them.
they
are
of
course
free
to
do
several
different
things
if
they
don't
like
the
particular
standards.
they
can
go
to
the
commission,
for
example,
and
say,
we
have
particular
local
conditions
which
are
causing
us
a
problem
that
makes
your
standards
inadequate.
and
we
would
like
a
waiver
from
the
commission
in
order
to
allow
us
to
use
some
additional
standards
or
more
detailed
standards.
and
the
commission
has
the
power
to
grant
that
waiver.
they
even
have
a
procedure
for
it.
or
it
can
go
to
the
commission
and
say,
change
the
standard.
we
think
the
federal
standards
should
be
higher.
they
should
be
more
detailed.
what
the
cities
can't
do
though
i
think
is
what
they
are
asking
to
do
here,
which
is
to
say
regardless
of
what
your
standards
are,
however
high
they
are,
we
can
always
impose
our
own
idiosyncratic
standards
on
top
of
those.
and
it
is
that,
i
think,
what
the
commission
was
concerned
about.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
that
the
issue
would
be
the
same
one,
justice
stevens.
i
think
again
that
would
not
be
a
question
of
basically
the
power
of
the
commission
to
regulate.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
right.
but
i
think
the
question
there
would
not
be
the
basic
question
of
whether
they
have
the
power
to
preempt
but
whether
the
decision
to
do
so
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
and
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
channels
ii,
iii
and
iv
below,
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
essence
said.
we
said,
you
know,
you
have
broad
powers
in
this
area
but
at
some
point
we
are
concerned
that
if
you
exercise
them
in
a
particular
way,
that
is
not
defensible
just
as
a
matter
of
their
exercise,
but
not
as
a
matter
of
the
existence
of
the
power
in
the
first
place.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
that
is
the
power
that
the--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--what
i
think
justice
stevens
is
that
624(e)
conveys
the
power
to
the
commission
to
regulate
in
the
area
of
technical
standards,
and
i
think
that
is
a
source
of
power
for
the
commission
to
do
that.
and
if
their
explanation
was
sufficient,
if
they
could
show
for
example
that
even
without
standards,
the
goals
of
the
act
could
be
met,
i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
legitimate.
thank
you.
