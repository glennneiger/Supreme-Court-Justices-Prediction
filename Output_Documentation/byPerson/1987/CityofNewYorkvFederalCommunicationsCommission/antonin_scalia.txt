justice
scalia
are
you
appealing
ii,
iii
and
iv?
i
thought
you
got
what
you
wanted
on
those?
justice
scalia
for
the
time
being,
anyway,
until
the
fcc
decides
what
it's
going
to
do?
justice
scalia
right.
have
you
brought
that
remand
here?
have
you
objected
to
that
remand?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
scalia
may
i
get
back
to
what
we
have
in
front
of
us
here?
i
thought
we
just
had
category
i,
not
ii,
iii,
and
iv,
because
the
question
presented
as
you
set
it
forth
in
your
brief
is
by
a
vote
of
2
to
1,
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
an
fcc
order
preempting
local
and
state
cable
television
technical
standards
which
are
more
stringent,
etcetera,
etcetera.
and
then
it
goes
on
and
says,
the
questions
presented
are
whether
the
court
of
appeals
applied
an
erroneous
legal
standard.
now,
on
ii,
iii
and
iv,
it
wasn't
2
to
1;
it
was
3
to
0,
wasn't
it?
so
i
assumed
you
accepted
the
court
of
appeals
decision
on
those?
justice
scalia
but
you
bring
before
us
dispositions,
not
legal
theories,
and
the
disposition
on
ii,
iii
and
iv
was
3
to
nothing.
and
i
did
not
understand
that
to
be
what
you
were
complaining
about.
i
thought
you'd
accepted
that
remand
to
the
commission.
justice
scalia
well,
it's
a
very
confusing
question
presented
if
you're
seeking
to
bring
that
here
too.
justice
scalia
where
are
they?
justice
scalia
i
understand.
where
are
they
in
the
briefs?
justice
scalia
mr.
mcgrath,
what
do
you
do
about
624(e),
which
is
on
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
118.
justice
scalia
which
says,
let
me
tell
you
my
problem
with
it.
it
says,
the
commission
may
establish
technical
standards
relating
to
facilities
and
equipment
which
a
franchising
authority
may
require
in
the
franchise.
now,
it
seems
to
me
the
natural
reading
of
that
is
the
commission
may
establish
those
technical
standards
which
and
only
which
the
franchising
authority
may
require.
otherwise,
it
seems
to
me,
everything
after,
which,
is
meaningless
if
we
follow
what
you
think--
justice
scalia
--right.
relating
to
the
facilities
and
equipment...
may
establish
technical
standards
which
a
franchising
authority
may
require
in
the
franchise.
justice
scalia
that's
right.
i
read
that
as
saying
the
fcc
may
establish
those
standards
that
can
be
required.
justice
scalia
well,
what
does
it
mean
if
it
doesn't
meant
that?
which
the
franchising
authority
may
require?
what
would
it
mean
if
it
doesn't
mean
what
i
just
said?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
saying,
binding.
i'm
saying
they
may
establish
technical
standards
which
a
franchising
authority
may
require.
i
think
the
only
way
to
read
that
is
they
may
establish
those
standards
that
can
be
required.
justice
scalia
if
it
only
means
what
i
think
you're
saying,
if
it
only
means
that
they
can
issue
advisory
standards,
you
wouldn't
need
which
a
franchising--
justice
scalia
--it
doesn't
say,
which
a
franchising
authority
must
require.
it
says,
it
shall
issue,
or
may
establish
standards
which
a
franchising
authority
may
require.
if
it
said
it
may
establish
standards
which
they
must
require,
then
it
would
mean
what
you
say.
but
it
doesn't
say,
which
they
must
require.
it
says
it
may
establish
standards
which
they
may
require,
meaning
only
these
may
they
require
and
no
others
may
they
require.
and
that
is
what
the
fcc
has
done.
justice
scalia
well,
it
says,
may
and
not
must.
justice
scalia
oh,
you
think
the
"which"
goes
with
facilities
and
equipment?
that's
a
very
strange
reading
of
the
english
language,
i
think.
it's
on
page
118
and
119
of
the
appendix.
justice
scalia
well,
but
why
do
we
need
to
go
back
to
624(a)
when
we're
talking
about
624(e)?
justice
scalia
you
mean
the
fcc
cannot
require
any
standards
for
unrequired
facilities
and
equipment,
if
the
people
put
in
some
facilities
and
equipment
that
haven't
been
specifically
required
by
the
municipality,
the
fcc
cannot
establish
standards
for
them?
is
that
a
reasonable
reading
of
it?
justice
scalia
it
can
only
establish
standards
for
required
facilities
and
equipment
and
if
the
municipality
chooses
not
to
require
any,
no
fcc
standards
apply?
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
the,
which,
has
to
relate
to
standards
and
not
to
facilities
and
equipment.
justice
scalia
do
you
understand
them
to
be
before
us?
justice
scalia
you
also
would
not
agree
with
the
reading
of
624(e)
that
i
was
suggesting
earlier?
justice
scalia
that
made
a
lot
of
sense
to
me
until
i
realized
these
standards
you're
talking
about
are
performance
standards.
what
you've
just
described
makes
it
sound
as
though
you're
describing
technological
standards
so
that
the
municipalities
won't
force
technology
into
one
direction
or
another.
but
you're
telling
me
that
what
the
commission
has
come
up
with
anyway
is
performance
standards,
hasn't
it?
