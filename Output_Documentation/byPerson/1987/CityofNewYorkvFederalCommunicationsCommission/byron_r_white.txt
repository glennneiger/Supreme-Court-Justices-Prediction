which
category
does
the
city
want
to--
justice
white
--have
they
proposed
standards
for
all
categories?
justice
white
for
all
of
them?
justice
white
do
you
think
the
issue
is
different
with
respect
to
the
first
category
where
the--
justice
white
--well,
the
commission
has
some
standards
for
category
i,
right?
justice
white
none
for
the
others
but
how
about
category
i?
isn't
the
issue
there
different
than
with
respect
to
the
categories
that
the
commission--
justice
white
--and
your
argument
is
the
same
with
respect
to
all
of
them
as
long
as
they're's
not
any
real
conflict?
justice
white
and
if
you
can
prove
that
in
question
in
the
first
category,
why,
it
goes
without
saying
to
the
other
categories.
justice
white
we're
only
talking
about
category
i
in
this
case,
aren't
we?
justice
white
well,
that
just
gives
you
more
authority.
justice
white
you
don't
think
anything
about
classes
ii,
iii
and
iv
is
here?
justice
white
directly?
do
we
have
to
face
it
either
way
we
decide
it?
if
we
decide
either
for
you
or
for
the
other
side,
we
still
don't
reach
ii
or
iii
or
iv?
justice
white
yes,
but
now
can
you
win
on
class
i
on
the
ground
that
you
are
urging
without
winning
on
ii,
iii
and
iv?
justice
white
well,
but
i
thought
you
were
trying
to
defend,
and
i
think
you
do,
the
power
of
the
commission
to
preempt.
just
say,
just
on
the
grounds
that
we
can
forbid
locals
from
establishing
technical
standards,
whether
they're
in
conflict
or
not?
justice
white
well,
doesn't
that
go
to
the
power
of
the
commission
to
preempt?
because
except
for
the
power
to
preempt,
just
the
fact
that
there
are
regulations
there
wouldn't
preempt
locals?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
city
of
new
york
case,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
