mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
are
here
pursuant
to
writ
of
cert
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit.
and
the
issue
is
the
authority
of
the
fcc
to
preempt
through
the
promulgation
of
certain
minimal
guidelines
as
to
cable
television
signal
quality,
to
preempt
all
local
franchisers
from
promulgating
technical
standards
as
to
signal
quality.
now
the
commission
has
adopted
a
deregulatory
approach
to
technical
standards
explicitly
as
to
signal
quality.
now,
in
the
past
going
back
to
1972,
the
commission
itself
had
promulgated
certain
technical
standards.
it
has
recognized
over
the
years,
however,
that
these
were
incomplete
and
that
they
didn't
cover
certain
problems
such
as
ghosting
of
a
picture.
nevertheless,
in
1985,
after
the
passage
of
the
new
cable
act,
the
commission
determined
to
no
longer
continue
these
standards
and
after
comments,
issued
a
ruling
in
which
these
prior
standards
were
continued
as
guidelines
that
could
be
included
by
franchisers
in
franchise
agreements
but
that
no
other
standard,
whether
a
similar
standard
which
was
more
stringent,
or
a
standard
for
some
other
quality
of
signal
quality
could
be
promulgated
by
local
franchisers.
now,
the
d.c.
circuit,
finding
more
persuasive
the
argument
of
the
commission
that
it
continue
to
have
a
broad
delegated
preemptive
power
which
this
court
had
recognized
in
the
capital
cities
case
under
the
old
communications
act,
that
this
continued
under
the
new
cable
act,
and
held
that
as
long
as
one
technical
guideline
was
adopted
by
the
commission
as
to
a
particular
classification
of
channels,
that
they
can
preempt
any
standards
by
local
franchisers.
but
even
the
court
of
appeals
had
some
difficulty
with
the
approach
of
the
commission.
the
only
classification
of
channels
for
which
any
standards,
now
guidelines,
had
ever
been
promulgated
were
the
traditional
broadcast
channels.
there
had
never
been
any
standards
or
guidelines
adopted
for
what
is
now
the
majority
of
cable
televisions
channels.
the
satellite
but
unencoded
broadcasts,
cnn,
that
sort
of
thing,
the
encoded
broadcast,
hbo,
and
then
a
fourth
category
that
the
fcc
had
promulgated,
that
is,
the
two-a
interaction.
for
those
other
three
types
of
channels,
they
had
never
promulgated
any
standards.
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
troubled
by
that.
and
pointing
to
certain
aspects
which
i'll
get
into
a
little
later
in
the
cable
act
that
it
would
be
very
difficult,
specifically
the
renewal
process,
be
very
difficult
for
franchisers
to
take
part
and
make
full
use
of
renewal
process
without
there
being
some
standards.
and
therefore
remanded
that
aspect
back
to
the
commission
to
reconsider.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
all
categories.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
we
have
standards
that
were
included
in
the
contracts
back
in
1983.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
yes,
your
honor.
and
these
include
not
just
the
four
guidelines
that
are
discussed
by
the
commission.
we
put
in
an
engineering
report
below
which
first
indicates
the
insufficiency
of
the
ones
that
are
guidelines
under
the
fcc
and
that
under
those
guidelines,
if
those
minimums
were
all
that
were
met,
the
resultant
picture
would
be
ghosting,
would
be
distortion,
would
be
clearly
an
unacceptable
picture.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
the
commission
has
taken
a
broader
approach
than
the
court
of
appeals
has
approved,
but
we
think
the
issue
is
not
merely
with
these
other
three
categories,
it's
not
merely--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--category
i
and
none
for
ii,
iii
and
iv.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
not
really,
justice
white,
because
under
the
court
of
appeals
approach,
they
can
merely
through
the
issuance
of
the
most
minimal
standard
fulfill
their
entire
regulatory
responsibility.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
yes,
justice
white--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--i
disagree,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
no,
we
don't--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--no,
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
for
them
to
consider.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
yes,
your
honor,
because
we
think
it's
an
issue
of
law.
it's
not
a
mere
matter
for
the
commission
to
consider
the
interworking
and
how
to
resolve
the
interworking
of
their
issue
standards
and
a
requirement
under
the
renewal
provision.
it's
our
position
that
reading
those
is
an
issue
of
law
that
makes
it
clear
under
all
categories
that
we
are
preempted
only
when
standards
are
issued
which
could
conflict
with
our
standards.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
where
none
are,
there's
no
conflict.
now,
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
wrong
preemption
standard
by
adopting
what
it
called
a
more
persuasive
argument,
and
reached
a
result
that's
in
conflict
both
with
the
purposes
and
the
provisions
of
the
cable
act.
turning
first
to
the
preemption,
as
justice
brennan
said
in
the
louisiana
case,
that
touchstone
of
preemption
is
congressional
intent.
and
as
this
court's
recognized
a
number
of
times,
where
there
are
two
legitimate
schemes
of
regulation,
congressional
intent
to
preempt
should
be
clear,
there
should
be
no
presumption
of
preemption,
and
that
where
possible,
those
two
spheres
of
regulation
should
be
accommodated
so
that
they
can
stand
together.
now,
the
commission
really
has
taken
the
position
that
within
this
area
of
technical
standards,
they're
allowed
to
preempt
the
field.
then
as
justice
white
remarked,
our
position
is
they
are
not
entitled
to
preempt
the
field
and
in
fact,
the
only
preemption
is
where
ours
cannot
stand
together
with
the
guidelines
issued
by
the
fcc.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
okay,
it's
in
624(e).
now,--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--well,
they've
made
some
oblique
comments
indicating
they
may
be
relying
upon
the
old
communications
act,
but
it's
our
position
that
that's
at
an
end.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
judge
mikva
agreed
that
there
should
be
a
remand
as
to
how
the
renewal
provision
worked
with
the
power
under
624(e).
i
think
his
position
is
consistent
with
ours,
that
is,
the
standards,
if
there
are
no
standards
or
if
there
are
standards
which
can
stand
with
our
local
standards,
there's
no
preemption.
it
really
doesn't
matter
what--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
believe
judge
mikva
would
have
voted
to
annul
the
rule
rather
than
merely
to
send
it
back
for
reconsideration.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
turning
to
the
statutory,
to
the
cable
act,
itself,
the
commission
has
pointed
to
one
of
the
stated
purposes
of
the
act,
that
is
to
limit
needless
regulation.
however,
the
preeminent
purpose
is
to
establish
a
national
policy
as
to
the
cable
industry.
now,
they
did
not
choose
to
effectuate
that
policy
as
had
been
done
under
the
communications
act
through
a
broad,
vague
delegation
of
power
to
the
fcc.
there
were
other
problems
that
they
meant
to
deal
with.
for
instance,
the
fcc
itself
had
moved
in
and
out
of
the
regulatory
process
and
that's
indicated
in
the
authoritative
report
that
congress
that
was
prepared
for
this
legislation.
so
instead
of
giving
the
fcc
broad
power,
they
clearly
delineated
in
the
statute
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
federal
and
the
state
and
local
agencies.
they
also
had
the
purpose
of
assuring
that
the
cable
companies
be
responsive
to
the
community
needs.
accordingly,
they
made
the
franchise
process
the
preeminent
regulatory
structure,
and
they
set
up
national
procedures
and
standards
to
assure
that
those
structures,
that
the
franchisers
remained
responsive
to
the
needs
of
the
localities,
but
at
the
same
time,
applied
national
standards.
now,
looking
at
the
most
relevant
statutory
provisions
dealing
with
requirements
for
facilities
and
equipment
confirms
that
in
that
area,
the
regulations
must
be
intensely
local.
first,
looking
at
section
624,
the
congress
stated--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--in
the
original
act
at
section
624.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
they're
in
the
appendix.
starting
at
page
116
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
in
section
624,
they've
empowered
franchisers
to
include
pretty
much
any
requirement
relating
to
facilities
and
equipment.
and
the
report
makes
it
clear
that
just
about
any
requirement
relating
in
any
way
to
the
operation
of
a
cable
system
can
be
required
to
be
put
into
the
proposals
and
can
be
enforced
by
the
franchiser.
the
next
relevant
section
is
625
which
deals
with
modification.
now,
congress,
as
the
commission
itself
has
indicated,
had
a
concern.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
i'm
sorry.
it's
625.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
yes.
and
immediately
thereafter
at
page
125
is
renewal.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
no,
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
modification,
justice
rehnquist.
now,
there
was
a
problem
back
in
the
70's
and
the
early
80s,
that
both
municipalities
expected
and
the
cable
companies
hoped
to
meet
very
sky
high
requirements,
both
as
to
services
and
to
equipment
and
facilities.
congress
recognized
this
problem,
passed
this
provision,
which
allows
upon
a
showing
that
attaining
a
particular
requirement
was
commercially
impracticable
that
the
franchisee
can
be
relieved
of
the
requirement.
perhaps
most
importantly
is
the
next
provision,
the
renewal
provision.
now,
this
again
was
to
face
a
problem,
a
foreseen
problem
that
cable
companies
that
had
expended
vast
capital
resources
to
establish
a
cable
system
would
not
be
unreasonably
denied
a
renewal.
and
the
thrust
of
the
statute
set
out
a
detailed
procedure
controlling
the
renewal
process,
specifically
when
there's
a
dispute.
and
the
whole
process
is
intensely
local.
the
first
step
of
the
process
is
an
inquiry
into
how
the
cable
operator
has
performed
under
the
prior
contract,
and
the
needs
of
the
community.
that's
on
notice,
not
to
the
commission,
but
on
notice
to
the
members
of
the
locality.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
my
point
is
this,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
justice
scalia,
do
you
mean
that
the
"which"
refers
back
to
the
technical
standards?
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
that
would
make
their
role
essentially
advisory.
that
they
could
promulgate
certain
standards
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
locality
to
include
that
in
the
franchise
process.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
oh,
you're
reading
it
as
limiting
what
can
be
done
by
the
franchisers.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
oh,
no.
i
think
one
could
reasonably...
and
that
has
not
been
our
position,
but
one
could
reasonably
read
this
to
say
the
commission
could
issue
advisory
technical
standards.
however,
it
has
always
been
our
position
that
they
can
issue
binding
technical
standards.
the
issue
for
the
court
to
resolve
is
whether
or
not
that
empowers
them
to
issue
certain
standards
and
tell
the
localities
that
they
can't
issue
other
technical
standards
which
can't...
which
can--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--with
respect,
your
honor,
only
by--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--no,
that's
not
our
position,
it's
never
been.
i'm
just
trying
to
point
out
that
this
is
a
very
vague
and
ambiguous
statute
and
might
even
be
reasonably
read
to
be
advisory.
now,
we
agree
they
can
issue
binding
standards,
but
binding
in
the
sense
that
if
we
tried
to
pass
some
standard
that
was
in
clear
conflict,
it
can't
stand
with
it,
then
that's
the
extent
of
their
preemption.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
well,
first
the
actual
wording
of
the
statute,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
reasonable
reading.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
it
refer
back
to
the
facilities
and
equipment.
they
can
issue
technical
standards
relating
to
the
facilities
and
equipment.
it's
the
facilities
and
equipment
which
we
may
include
in
the--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--with
respect...
if
you
go
back
to
section
624(a)--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--all
i'm
trying
to
indicate
is
they
frequently
refer
to
facilities
and
equipment
that
may
be
required.
that's
why
i
read
this
provision,
which
a
franchiser
may
require,
as
going
back
to
the
facilities
and
equipment.
we
can
require
any
number,
any
different
types
of
facilities
and
equipment.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
with
respect,
judge,
that's
our
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
justice
scalia,
the
whole
structure--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--well,
if
no
jurisdiction
require
particular
facilities
and
equipment,
i
don't
see
what
the
purpose
of
them
issuing
the
guidelines
would
be.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
well,
getting
back
to
the...
this
is
the
only
provision
on
which
they
rely,
and
if
they're
reading
is
given
full
force,
they
in
essence
read
out
substantial
provisions
of
625
and
626.
under
626
in
the
renewal
process,
one
of
the
findings
which
can
be
the
basis
for
a
denial
of
renewal
is
that
the
quality
of
the
service
under
the
prior
contract
in
light
of
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
community
has
not
been
satisfactory
into
the
quality
of
the
service.
and
one
of
the
particulars
that
they
point
to
is
the
signal
quality.
now,
if
the
fcc
can
issue
these
minimal
guidelines,
how
are
we
to
turn
down
renewal
based
upon
the
signal
quality
if
we're
not
able
to
point
to
specific
guidelines?
the
federal
guidelines
certainly
are
not
going
to
enable
us
to
do
this
because
as
we
put
in
our
affidavit
below
of
an
engineer,
all
that's
going
to
result
following
those
guidelines
will
result
in
a
snowy
picture.
and
a
cable
operator
can
say,
you
can't
deny
my
renewal
based
upon
this
because
i've
complied
with
the
federal
guidelines.
and
there's
a
further
step
under
the
renewal
process.
the
whole
process
is
aimed
at
clear
determination
consistent
with--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
thank
you,
justice
rehnquist.
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
discussion
of
section
624(e)
and
justice
scalia's
interpretation
of
that
provision.
now,
we
submit
that
a
reading
of
that
provision
as
providing
that
there
can
be
only
technical
standards
where
the
commission
has
promulgated
such
standards
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
now,
first
at
page
116,
section
624(a)(1)
empowers
a
franchiser
to
require
that
in
proposals,
that
the
franchiser
may
establish
requirements
for
facilities
and
equipment.
these
are
highly
technical
matters,
and
we
submit
that
only
through...
and
technical
standards
would
naturally
be
part
of
a
requirement
for
facilities
and
equipment.
possibly
more
relevant
at
page
127,
as
i
stated
before,
there's
a
delineated
process
in
which
renewal
can
be
accomplished,
and
there
are
a
limited
number
of
findings
which
can
be
made
to
support
a
denial
of
renewal.
one
of
those
findings
is
laid
out
at
page
127.
and
if
i
can
quote
it:
"the
quality
of
the
operator
service
including
signal
quality
has
been
reasonable
in
light
of
community
needs.
"
first
of
all,
we
submit
that
without
technical
standards,
there's
no
way
in
which
such
a
finding
can
be
made.
we'd
be
left
to
basing
unsatisfactory
signal
quality,
assuming
the
commission
issued
no
guidelines,
upon
subjective
complaints.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
but
if
one
reads
624(e)
the
way
i
believe
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
read
it,
we
would
not
have
the
power
to
issue
any
standards
unless
the
commission
first
took
the
affirmative
step
of
allowing
us,
in
essence,
passing
their
own
regulation
and
then
we'd
be
allowed
to
adopt
that.
now,
if
we're
only
empowered
to
pass
the
regulation
at
the
whim
of
the
commission
and
the
commission
decided
not
to
pass
any
regulations
this
section
would
in
essence
be
read
out
of
the
statute.
and
we
submit
the
commission's
also
probably
the
last
entity
that
could
determine
whether
signal
quality
is
satisfactory
in
light
of
community
needs.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
justice
stevens,
the
main
thrust
of
the
renewal
procedure
is
to
set
up
a
due
process
kind
of
procedure.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
whether
or
not
it's
absolutely
impossible
to
make
this
finding,
it
would
seem
quite
reasonable,
and
we
submit
compelling
to
be
able
to
base
the
determination
upon
whether
or
not
they
satisfied
certain
kinds
of
standards.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
no,
justice
stevens,
my
argument
is
just
as
justice
scalia
read
624(e),
that
the
only
entity
that's
empowered
to
allow
technical
standards
to
be
placed
into
franchise
agreements
is
the
fcc.
we
submit,
no,
that
in
fact,
both
the
local
franchiser
in
light
of
626
and
the
general
provisions
of
624
is
similarly
empowered
to
issue
technical
standards.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
no,
our
position--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--no.
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
they
can
issue
standards,
and
as
long
as
our
standards
are
not
inconsistent.
not
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
policy
of
the
fcc.
they're
empowered
here
to
issue
standards,
not
to
set
broad
policy.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
well,
as
i
mentioned
earlier
in
my
argument,
they
do
make
references
to
the
earlier
communications
act,
but
do
not
clearly
state
in
their
briefs
that
they
are
relying
upon
that
statute.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
we
believe
to
some
extent
that
they
are
relying
on
it,
and
that
that's
improper.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
well,
in
essence
there
was
no
prior
statute.
if
you'll
look,
the
midwest
video
case,--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--not
at
that
time,
but
there's
a
long
case
load
going
back
to
southwest
cable
through
the
two
midwest
video
cases
and
finally
the
capital
cities
case
where
this
court
recognized
that
the
commission
under
the
communications
act
had
broad
regulatory
powers.
but
as
justice
berger,
chief
justice
berger
pointed
out
in
his
concurrence
of
the
first
midwest
video
case,
because
the
communications
act
was
passed
ten,
20
years
prior
to
cable
television,
in
essence
it
was
the
commission
and
this
court
that
was
setting
broad
policy
decisions
that
had
to
be
made
by
congress.
congress
has
made
those
policy
decisions.
has
decided
that
regulation
is
not
to
be
done
broadly
through
a
vague
delegation
of
power
as
pursuant
to
the
communications
act,
but
under
the
specific
guidelines
of
the
cable
act.
the
cable
act
gives
some
duties
to
the
commission.
it
gives
some
duties
to--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
our
position.
now,
i
have
a
few
minutes
left.
i
didn't
have
a
chance
before,
but
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgrath
thank
you,
chief
justice.
as
to
justice
stevens'
inquiry
as
to
the
source
of
the
power
under
the
act,
i'd
refer
you
to
footnote
7
in
which
we
set
out
the
wording
under
the
new
cable
act,
and
it
amends
the
communications
act
section
2(a)
to
provide
that
the
provisions
of
this
act,
the
communications
act,
shall
apply
with
respect
to
cable
service
to
all
persons
engaged
within
the
united
states
as
provided
in
title
iv,
the
cable
act.
and
at
footnote
16,
we've
indicated
there
was
a
prior
senate
version
of
that
kind
of
amendment
which
might
more
reasonably
support
their
argument.
that
version
was
rejected
and
this
version
was
adopted.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
claim
that
the
federal
policy
is
to
protect
the
national
market,
that
there
be
standardization.
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
that's
a
matter
that
was
decided
by
the
congress.
if
one
looks
at
624,
it's
clear
that
the
standards
are
those
that
are
to
be
responsive
to
the
community
needs,
it's
the
local
franchiser.
even
if
we
don't
have
the
power
to
issue
technical
standards,
our
broad
power
to
require
equipment
and
facilities
would
necessarily
reject
the
argument
that
the
effect
on
national
suppliers
is
a
consideration
under
the
act.
congress
decided
those
kind
of
problems
would
be
dealt
through
the
modification
process.
if
they're
not
commercially
practicable,
then
they
fall.
finally,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
this
claimed
continuance
of
the
prior
dual
regulation,
it's
always
been
the
fcc's
position,
at
least
under
the
communications
act,
that
it
would
regulate
the
operational
aspects
and
leave
to
the
localities
some
small
area
of
protection,
protection
of
the
equipment
from
the
elements.
and
that
approach
is
confirmed
by
a
reading
of
capital
cities.
the
purport
to
have
a
broad
power
in
this
area.
they
are
now
trying
to
continue
that
under
the
act.
at
most,
they've
been
given
some
power
as
to
technical
standards
but
it
certainly
in
any
event
is
not
a
continuation
of
what
was
being
done
prior
the
the
act.
thank
you,
your
honors.
