are
we
talking
about
the
joint
appendix?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess,
mr.
wallace,
you're
also
taking
the
position
that
even
apart
from
the
regulation
adopted
by
the
fcc
preempting
that
any
promulgation
of
standards
by
the
fcc
would
effectively
preclude
the
franchising
authority
from
having
stricter
standards?
justice
o'connor
you
are
arguing
both
things?
i
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
all
the
fcc
did
was
adopt
some
standards
without
telling
anybody
anything
else?
justice
o'connor
now,
as
i
understand
it,
you
take
the
position
that
the
reason
the
fcc
wants
to
promulgate
standards
of
this
type
is
to
encourage
competition?
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
at
the
renewal
stage,
i
gather
it
makes
no
difference
if
there's
another
cable
company
that
can
put
out
a
stronger
better
signal
and
meet
high
standards?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
gather
the
competition
only
occurs
in
the
first
instance
of
granting
a
franchise,
not
at
the
renewal
stage.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
and
today
under
that
amendment
now
a
franchising
authority
could
not
deny
renewal
because
it
had
a
better
offer
from
some
other
company
offering
stronger
and
better
facilities,
equipment,
and
signals?
justice
o'connor
the
language
of
the
act
to
the
uninitiated
is
a
little
confusing,
though,
because
in
624(b),
it
says
the
franchising
authority
may
establish
requirements
for
facilities
and
equipment.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
their
argument
though
is
those
are
so
minimal
that
they
want
to
do
better,
that
they
don't
do
well
enough.
