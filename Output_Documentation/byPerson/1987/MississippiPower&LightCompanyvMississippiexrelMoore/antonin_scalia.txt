justice
scalia
it
isn't
the
allocation
that
is
the
source
of
the
controversy
here.
as
i
understand
it,
the
state
was
willing
to
accept
that
if
this
was
a
prudent
investment,
we
are
stuck
with
33
percent
of
it,
or
whatever
the
figure
is.
you
can
acknowledge
the
ferc
is
entitled
to
allocate
without
acknowledging
that
ferc
is
entitled
to
decide
whether
the
investment
was
prudent
to
begin
with,
can't
you?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
like
justice
stevens,
i
see
a
lot
of
different
prudence
issues
here.
one
issue
is
whether
it
is
prudent
to
build
this
plant
for
the
four
states.
the
answer
to
that
is
not
necessarily
the
same
as
the
answer
of
whether
it
was
prudent
for
mississippi
to
throw
in
its
lot
with
the
other
states.
that
could
be
quite
different.
it
could
make
sense
for
the
four
states
but
make
no
sense
at
all
for
mississippi
to
go
along
with
it.
mississippi
consumers
could
be
milked
by
the
consumers
of
the
other
three
states.
now,
can
you
tell
me
how
the
state
of
mississippi
can
protect
its
consumers
against
that?
how
can
the
state
of
mississippi
say
we
don't
want
to
go
into
this
regional
thing
in
the
first
place?
where
is
that
prudence
issue
determined?
justice
scalia
what
if
the
plant
is
being
built
in
another
state?
it
can't
protect
itself
by
denying
approval
for
the
building
of
the
plant,
can
it?
justice
scalia
but
ferc's
interest
is
in
the
whole
four-state
region.
it's
not
in
mississippi
alone.
who
protects
mississippi's
narrow,
selfish
interest?
it
makes
sense
for
the
four
states,
and
ferc
is
going
to
say
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
mississippi
says
it
does,
but
it
doesn't
make
sense
for
our
people.
justice
scalia
what
about
my
prudence
question?
does
ferc
decide
my
prudence
question,
too?
that
is,
whether
it
was
prudent
for
mississippi
to
throw
in
with
the
other
three
states?
justice
scalia
who
decides
that?
justice
scalia
but
that
could
be
based
on
the
fact
that
mp&l
threw
itself
in
with
the
deal
a
number
of
years
ago.
justice
scalia
and
ferc
is
just
saying
a
deal
is
a
deal.
you
committed
to
take
an
equitable
portion
of
it.
this
is
an
equitable
portion.
but
has
ferc
addressed
the
point
of
whether
it
was
wise
in
the
first
place
for
you
to
commit
yourself
to
take
an
equitable
portion
of
this
plant?
justice
scalia
could
mississippi
have
stopped
that?
is
it
your
position
that
mississippi
would
have
authority
to
stop
its
utility
from
participating
in
a
multi-state
energy
operation
such
as
that?
would
the
commerce
clause
prevent
it,
or
anything
else
prevent
it?
justice
scalia
but
didn't?
justice
scalia
is
it
fair
to
say,
mr.
maxey,
that
all
of
the
arguments
that
mississippi
wishes
to
present
now
with
reference
to
prudence
could
have
been
made
before
ferc
even
though
ferc
is
being
asked
to
draw
a
different
conclusion
than
the
mississippi
regulatory
commission
would
be?
justice
scalia
would
you
be
bound
by
ferc's
determination
if
you
had
raised
those
issues
at
the
ferc
level
seeking
to
effect
wholesale
prices?
would
you
acknowledge
that
you
could
not
then
take
a
second
bite
and
raise
the
same
issues
at
the
retail
level?
justice
scalia
i'm
sure
they
would.
i'm
asking
you
whether
it
would
be
successful.
justice
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
case,
mr.
maxey,
in
which
ferc
has
denied
an
element
of
wholesale
rates
on
the
basis
that
the
investment
was
imprudent?
has
ferc
ever
done
that
to
your
knowledge?
