mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
was
squarely
decided
two
terms
ago
by
this
court's
unanimous
holding
in
nantahala
v.
thornburgh
that
the
federal
power
act
requires
state
and
local
regulators,
when
they
set
retail
electric
rates,
to
include
within
those
rates
wholesale
power
supply
costs
which
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
has
determined
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
the
court
left
open
the
possibility
of
one
narrow
exception
which
was
inapplicable
in
nantahala
and,
for
reasons
that
i
will
explain
in
just
a
moment,
is
clearly
inapplicable
here.
at
the
center
of
the
dispute
is
a
nuclear
power
plant,
grand
gulf
i,
which
is
owned
by
an
integrated
electric
system,
middle
south
utilities,
whose
four
wholly-owned
public
utilities
serve
parts
of
four
separate
states.
ferc
found
that
the
grand
gulf
plant
was
constructed
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
system
as
a
whole,
including
the
diversification
of
its
fuel
sources,
which,
until
the
mid-1970s,
were
limited
to
oil
and
gas.
because
of
circumstances
unforeseen
at
the
time
grand
gulf
was
originally
planned,
its
fixed
costs,
and
therefore
its
total
costs,
were
among
the
highest
on
the
middle
south
system,
even
though
its
operating
expenses
are
the
lowest.
for
this
reason,
this
case
presents
a
circumstance
that
is
very
common
throughout
the
country
today
and
indeed,
is
inevitable
in
any
integrated
interstate
electric
system.
in
an
effort
to
diversify
its
fuel
sources
and
to
provide
for
the
long-range
needs
of
its
customers,
any
integrated
system
is
going
to
end
up
with
several
different
generation
sources
and
the
costs
of
some
are
going
to
be
substantially
higher
than
others.
moreover,
the
source
that
is
the
most
expensive
today
will
not
necessarily
be
the
most
expensive
a
few
years
from
now,
depending
on
such
variables
as
the
world
price
of
oil.
each
of
the
states
served
by
such
a
system
would,
of
course,
like
to
have
for
itself
and
its
customers
as
much
of
the
system's
low-cost
power
and
as
little
of
its
high-cost
power
as
possible.
someone
has
to
decide
who
gets
how
much
of
each.
fortunately,
the
federal
power
act
entitles
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
to
allocate
these
widely
differing
costs
among
the
companies
and
the
states
involved;
and
ferc's
authority
to
make
those
allegations
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
it
is
a
given.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
again
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
context
of
an
integrated
system
such
as
this
one
is.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
the
division
of
authority
is
between
the
initial
authorization
to
construct
the
plant,
as
you
have
correctly
stated,
and
the
authorization
to
set
the
wholesale
rates
for
the
power
that
comes
from
that
plant
once
it
is
constructed.
and
mississippi
can
say
no,
and
that
means
that
it
won't
be
built
in
mississippi.
it
does
not
mean
that
it
won't
be
built
in
some
other
state.
and
the
interstate
allocations
are
clearly
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
believe,
for
reasons
stated
in
our
brief,
and
for
reasons
stated
in
ferc's
brief
itself,
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
it
is
susceptible
of
either
interpretation.
it
is
somewhat
persuasive
that
ferc
itself
believes
that
it
decided
the
prudence
issue.
but
the
more
important
point
is
that,
regardless
of
whether
it
was
done
or
not,
the
only
entity
that
has
the
authority
under
the
federal
power
act
to
deal
with
those
contracts
affecting
wholesale
rates
is
ferc
itself.
so
that
if
prudence
is
going
to
be
decided,
it
must
be
decided
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
and
not
on
a
state
to
state
basis.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
let
me
just
give
you
two
factors
for
your
consideration,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
one
is,
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
nantahala.
you
had
there
not
an
integrated
system
of
the
type
that
we
have
here,
but
you
did
have
two
wholly-owned
subsidiaries
of
a
single
company...
alcoa...
and
they
had
two
different
sources...
one
lower
cost
and
one
higher
cost.
and
the
question
was
whether
ferc's
allocation
of,
in
that
case
the
lower
cost
power,
was
binding
on
the
north
carolina
utilities
commission
at
the
time
that
it
set
the
retail
rates
for
that
commission.
and
this
court
held
that
the
power
to
set
retail
rates
necessarily
meant
the
power
to
make
these
allocations.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
brings
us
to
the
core
legal
question
that
is
raised
by
this
case.
and
that
is
whether
there
prudency
determinations
can
be
made
by
the
states
on
a
case-to-case
basis
in
the
wake
of
a
determination
of
an
allocation
by
ferc.
we
submit,
number
one,
that
that
issue
was
determined
by
nantahala,
which
did
involve
an
allocation
case,
and
number
two,
that
any
other
scheme
permitting
these
allocations
to
be
redone
by
the
states
in
the
wake
of
an
allocation
that
has
already
been
done
by
ferc
would
simply
nullify
the
ferc
allocations
that
have
already
been
made
and
make
a
shambles
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission's
function.
and
that
is
particularly
true
in
an
integrated
system
such
as
this
one.
the
prudence
issue
is
relevant
only
in
those
instances
where
a
utility
has
a
choice
to
make,
and
then
chooses
the
more
expensive
alternative.
but
it
is
irrelevant
to
ferc
allocations
of
system
capacity
among
the
operating
subsidiaries
of
a
public
utility
holding
company,
for
this
reason.
mississippi
power
&
light
really
has
no
alternative
to
grand
gulf
power,
because
mississippi
power
&
light
is
part
of
the
middle
south
system
which
planned
and
built
grand
gulf
to
meet
system
needs
as
a
whole.
the
question
is
how
that
system's
capacity,
including
grand
gulf,
is
to
be
allocated
among
the
operating
companies.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
no.
it
doesn't
mean
nobody
does.
it
means
that
if
it
is
to
be
done,
then
the
procedures
which
are
provided
by
the
federal
power
act
which
permit
anyone,
including
states,
to
participate
and
indeed
to
initiate
those
proceedings,
must
do
so
before
ferc.
take
the
steps,
justice
o'connor,
one
at
a
time.
the
first
is
the
authorization
of
the
plant.
and
that
one
is
vested
in
the
states.
the
second
step,
then,
is
the
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
wholesale
rates.
and
nantahala
clearly
held
that
the
allocation
of
sources
among
wholly-owned
subsidiaries
is
included
within
the
setting
of
retail
rates...
excuse
me,
of
wholesale
rates.
now,
once
that
allocation
has
been
made,
if
the
individual
states
can
then
come
along
in
the
wake
of
that
determination
and
make
their
own
allocation,
then
each
state
will
necessarily
favor
its
own
parochial
interests
and
the
careful
plan
of
the
federal
power
act
to
vest
those
wholesale
rate
determinations
in
one
disinterested
tribunal,
the
only
tribunal
that
does
not
have
a
constituency
to
serve
will
have
been
frustrated.
and
indeed,
the
very
argument
that
mississippi
makes
in
this
case
shows
why
it
is
that
prudence
determinations,
that
the
prudence
issue
simply
is
not
an
issue
at
all
for
anyone,
either
state
or
federal,
in
a
case
like
this
which
involves
an
integrated
interstate
system.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
prudence
is
simply
not
an
issue
in
the
one
narrow
instance
in
which
you
have
an
integrated
system
such
as
we
have
here,
serving
several
different
states
in
which
you
have
several
different
power
sources,
and
all
of
those
have
to
be
allocated
among
the
separate
states
by
some
governmental
entity.
and
it
has
been
done
by
ferc.
this
leaves
for
the
state
all
of
the
traditional
regulatory
authority
that
they
always
had
with
the
exception
of
one
narrow
function.
and
that
is
that
once
the
wholesale
power
supply
costs
have
been
determined
by
ferc,
then
those
necessarily
become
costs
for
retail,
they
become
part
of
the
revenue
requirements
for
the
retail
ratemakers.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
most
instances,
they
are.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
the
way
they
can
protect
themselves
is
precisely
by
what
section
206
of
the
federal
power
act
says.
and
that
is
to
participate
before
ferc
and
to
make
an
argument
before
the
only
entity
that
has
the
authority
to
make
that
determination.
and
that
is
exactly
what
they
did.
the
ferc
determination,
the
ferc
allocation
in
this
case,
was
over
three
years
in
the
making.
every
single
interested
jurisdiction,
including
the
state
of
mississippi,
through
its
attorney
general
and
its
public
service
commission,
participated
in
that
hearing.
and
each
one
of
them
presented
its
own
separate
formula
that
served
its
own
separate
state
interests
as
to
how
those
costs
ought
to
be
allocated.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
at
the
time
that
the
original
investment,
that
the
original
certificate
is
issued,
then
the
state
can
take
whatever
factors
into
account
it
wants
to
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
determines
whether
or
not
there
would
be
an
authorization
for
the
building
of
the
plant.
now,
they
could
still
come
back.
in
fact,
it
would
still
be
open
to
them
today
to
go
before
ferc
and
say
that
it
was
not
prudent
to
continue
the
plant
or
that
it
was
not...
well,
it
has
already
been
determined
that
the
allocation
is
prudent
to
give
mississippi
33
percent.
but
chaos
would
be
the
result
if
that
is
not
the
case,
because
ferc
has
carefully
considered
the
different
positions
that
have
been
advanced
by
each
of
the
different
states
and
has
determined
what
is
a
just
and
reasonable
allocation.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
was
exactly
the
issue
that
was
before
this
court
two
terms
ago
in
nantahala
when
north
carolina
wanted
to
do
just
exactly
that.
and
to
say
that
even
though
this
has
been
determined
to
be
a
reasonable
wholesale
rate,
we
are
going
to
re-examine
the
prudence
of
the
case
at
the
state
level.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
if
the
state
of
mississippi
says
that
it
doesn't
want
to
go
into
it
in
the
first
place,
it
can
of
course
turn
down
the
plant.
that
means
that
it
may
be
built
in
another
state
or
it
may
not.
it
can
also
make
the
same
prudence
arguments
that
it
made
during
the
course
of
a
three-year
long
proceeding
before
the
ferc
and
make
its
argument
there.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
but
what
it
can
do
is
to
protect
its
interests
by
arguing
before
the
only
entity
that
has
authority
over
the
wholesale
rates
that
come
out
of
that
plant.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
there
is
no
more
reason
to
assume
that
that
issue
can
be
decided
any
better
by
a
court
than
it
can
by
an
administrative
agency.
certainly
that
is
the
only
administrative
agency
that
has
the
authority
over
all
of
the
jurisdictions
and
not
just
one.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
first,
i
would
like
to
just
clarify
that
every
single
one
of
these
prudence
issues
could
be
raised
before
ferc,
and
also,
that
ferc
can
and
does
reject
increases
in
the
wholesale
rate
base
on
the
basis
that
the
costs
are
imprudently
acquired.
footnote
15
of
our
reply
brief
discusses
the
cases
in
which
that
happens.
ferc
did
not
consider
these
issues,
or
said
they
did
not
consider
them...
we
think
they
did...
but
in
any
event,
the
alj
said
that
he
wasn't
going
to
consider
anything
that
was
not
raised.
the
crucial
point
is
that
these
matters
can
and
must
be
raised
before
ferc
if
they
are
to
be
raised
at
all,
and
the
reason
lies
right
at
the
heart
of
why
the
federal
power
act
was
enacted.
it
was
enacted
in
order
to
preclude
violations
of
the
commerce
clause
that
would
otherwise
occur.
it
is
very
apparent
that
the
alternatives
to
the
use
of
grand
gulf
power
to
which
the
mississippi
attorney
general
refers
is
the
use
of
otherwise,
of
the
other
sources
within
the
middle
south
system,
oil
and
gas,
which
are
cheaper,
which
are
located
right
within
mississippi
and
which,
if
grand
gulf
has
not
used,
will
then
be
sent
out
of
state
to
other
parts
of
the
middle
south
system.
that
is
the
nepco
case,
and
nepco
squarely
declares
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
and
that
is
why
we
have
a
federal
power
act,
because
we
are
one
nation
and
we
need
one
entity
that
can
prevent
these
violations
of
the
commerce
clause
that
would
otherwise
occur.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
ferc
has
made
a
determination
that
it
is
just
and
reasonable
for
mississippi
to
bear
33
percent
of
the
costs
of
grand
gulf.
and
what
we
have
here
is
nothing
less
than
an
attempt
to
have
the
states
test
the
prudence
of
the
costs
that
ferc
has
ordered
that
mississippi
bear.
thank
you.
