mr.
louis
r.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
with
justice
o'connor's
question.
the
state
of
mississippi
had
the
power
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
license
a
plant
located
within
mississippi.
and
there
are
various
things
on
which
it
could
condition
that
license.
but
the
one
thing
that
it
could
not,
and
by
the
say,
the
state
of
mississippi
did
not
attempt
to
impose
as
a
condition
on
that
license,
is
that
the
power
that
is
produced
by
that
plant
be
sold
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce
on
terms
other
than
the
terms
filed
with
ferc.
all
of
the
power
that
is
produced
by
grand
gulf
i
is
sold
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce,
and
the
terms
for
that
sale
can
be
determined
only
by
ferc.
the
question
whether
the
wholesaler,
mse,
should
be
permitted
to
charge
the
full
price,
its
full
costs
for
producing
that
power,
or
should
be
denied
some
of
that
return
on
the
ground
that
the
investment
was,
in
whole
or
in
part,
imprudent,
that
question
is
a
question
that
can
only
be
decided
by
ferc
because--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
that
ferc
has
decided
it
only
in
the
sense
that
the
issue
was
not
raised
and
some
parts
of
the
issue
have
probably
been
decided
by
the
failure
of
the
state
which
participated
in
the
ferc
proceeding
to
raise
the
issue.
there
may
be
other
parts
that
remain
open.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
we
are
talking
about
a
potential
challenge
to
a
wholesale
rate
charged
by
a
wholesaler
for
transactions
in
interstate
commerce.
i
think
that
the
question
whether
and
to
what
extent
ferc
has
decided
prudence
issues
relating
to
that
rate
ought
to
be
left
for
ferc
itself
to
decide
if
the
state
of
mississippi
or
others
now
want
to
go
back
to
ferc
and
argue
that
the
whole
thing
was
imprudent
or
they
put
solid
gold
doorknobs
on
it
and
that
was
an
imprudent
investment...
if
somebody
wants
to
go
back
to
ferc
and
argue--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--the
question
that
i
am
explicitly
declining
to
answer
is
the
extent
to
which
such
challenges
are
precluded.
certainly
some
challenges
are
open.
indeed,
ferc
is
engaged
in
a
continuous
audit
of
the
operation
of
this
plant.
and
the
state
can,
under
section
206,
go
to
ferc,
argue
that
the
charges
for
the
power
that
is
produced
by
this
plant
to
the
local
utility
are
unjust
and
unreasonable
because
expenses
were
not
prudently
incurred,
and
ferc
decides
that.
the
present
point
is
only
that
ferc's
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
prudence
of
facilities,
all
of
whose
power
is
sold
in
wholesale
and
interstate
commerce,
must
be
exclusive.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
don't
think
it
is
an
end
run.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
but
it
can...
no,
it
cannot
insist
that
the
plant
be
built
if
the
state
wants
to
say
no.
but
it
can
decide
that
a
utility
system
that
has
built
a
plant
will
not
be
allowed
to
charge
the
full
costs
of
building
that
plant
if
they
were
not
prudently
incurred
and
the
power
is
being
sold
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
and
ferc
explicitly
decided
at
least
part
of
that
question.
the
state
of
mississippi
tried
here
and
they
tried
before
ferc
to
analogize
this
to
the
kind
of
case
at
which
ferc
has
merely
set
a
price,
at
which
a
wholesaler
can
sell,
but
hasn't
obliged
the
retailer
to
buy.
but
ferc
here
set
the
terms,
including
the
obligation
of
mp&l
to
buy
one
third
of
the
power.
and
in
doing
that,
it
explicitly
rejected
mississippi's
argument
that
mp&l
itself
has
excess
capacity
and
that
grand
gulf
should
be
paid
for
by
the
short
companies
in
the
system.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
close
to
the
heart
of
the
issue.
this
is
a
system
that
has
been
physically
interconnected--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
talking
about
a
decision
in
19551
to
create
this
system,
a
decision
which
i
believe
mississippi
would
have
had
to
approve
the
participation
of
its
utility
in.
but
its
utility
joined
in
a
petition
to
the
sec
to
form
a
holding
company
system
and
that
system
was
approved
by
the
sec.
in
1951
it
filed
a
first
system
agreement.
the
plants
that
are
run
by
all
four
of
the
utilities
on
the
system
have
been
physically
interconnected
ever
since.
all
of
the
sources
of
electrical
capacity
and
power
available
to
mp&l
have
been
subject,
with
the
result
of
systemwide
planning,
and
have
been
subject
to
systemwide
contracts,
setting
forth
the
terms
on
which
their
capacity
and
their
energy
are
available
to
the
four
utilities
ever
since
1951.
ferc
had
all
of
the
present
versions
of
those
arrangements
before
it
for
review
in
this
proceeding.
ferc
had
express
power
under
section
206
to
determine,
as
it
did,
that
the
agreements
were
unjust
and
to
set
just
and
reasonable
terms.
mississippi
did
what
it
should.
it
argued
to
ferc
that
grand
gulf
should
be
treated
as
added
to
the
existing
sources
of
power
in
such
a
way
that
each
company
would
first
get
credit
for
its
older,
cheaper
sources
of
power,
and
the
companies
that
are
then
short,
the
companies
that
say
we
don't
need
this
power
because
we've
got
plenty,
should
pay
for
grand
gulf.
ferc
explicitly
concluded
that
that
would
be
unjust
and
instead
that
the
way
that
the
system
operated,
the
fact
that
the
nuclear
capacity
supplies
the
baseload
and
was
invested
in
on
that
basis,
made
it
appropriate
for
the
four
companies
first
to
share
the
nuclear
capacity
in
proportions
specified
by
ferc
and
that
the
companies
that
are
then
long
after
they
have
bought
their
share
of
the
nuclear
power,
should
sell
the
older,
cheaper
power
to
the
other
companies
in
the
system.
as
i've
said,
all
of
the
parties
to
this
case,
the
mississippi
parties
participated
in
those
proceedings
before
ferc,
they
also
participated
in
the
review
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
which
that
court
squarely
upheld
the
power
of
ferc
to
impose
a
third
of
the
costs
of
grand
gulf
i
on
mississippi...
or
33
percent...
on
mississippi
power
and
light.
we
think
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court's
decision
is
trying
to
subject
mp&l
to
a
state
prudence
review
of
costs
that
ferc
has
properly
ordered
it
to
bear,
and
that
under
nantahala,
the
mississippi
public
service
commission
was
required
to
do
just
what
it
did,
which
is
to
accept
that
ferc-imposed
cost
as
reasonable
and
to
give
it
effect
in
setting
retail
rates.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
