justice
o'connor
mr.
lee,
i
am
anxious
to
ask
you
a
question
or
two
about
this
case.
as
i
understand
it,
the
federal
power
act
does
not
grant
ferc
any
jurisdiction
over
generating
facilities.
so
it
is
not
possible
to
apply
to
ferc
in
the
first
instance
to
get
permission
to
build
a
nuclear
generating
facility.
right?
justice
o'connor
and
that
application
for
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
was
made
to
the
state
of
mississippi,
which
granted
it.
justice
o'connor
now,
what
if
a
state
refuses
the
permission
to
build
and
yet
the
plant
is
built
elsewhere
and
under
the
system's
agreement
some
allocation
is
made
to
a
mississippi
utility
company
that
is
part
of
the
system,
and
ferc
says
the
rates
are
just
and
reasonable.
does
that
mean
that
then
the
state
of
mississippi
has
to
accept
and
allow
that
quantity
of
power
to
be
sold
in
the
state
at
those
ferc-approved
rates?
justice
o'connor
even
if
they
had
denied
the
permission?
justice
o'connor
is
there
any
indication
that
ferc
ever
decided
that
this
allocation
was
prudent
and
that
the
construction
of
the
facility
was
prudent?
justice
o'connor
it
didn't
do
it
in
so
many
words,
did
it?
justice
o'connor
the
thing
that
is
so
basically
troublesome,
though,
is
that
under
your
view,
admittedly
the
federal
power
act
does
not
let
ferc
decide
in
the
first
instance
to
review
generating
facilities
if
a
new
one
is
going
to
be
built.
ferc
doesn't
review
that.
it
is
left
to
the
states.
and
yet,
even
if
the
states
refuse
to
permit
it
to
be
built,
you
say
that
a
subsequent
ferc
determination
about
rates
precludes
any
review
by
the
state
as
to
the
prudence
of
a
new
facility
when
ferc
itself
doesn't
review
it.
that
just
means
nobody
does.
justice
o'connor
mr.
lee,
aren't
all
these
nuclear
plants
serving
more
than
one
state?
justice
o'connor
sure.
so
it
is
a
concern
to
know
how
states
can
protect
themselves
from
what
they
perceive
today
to
be
a
likely
scenario
of
big
cost
overruns
and
concerns.
how
are
the
states
going
to
protect
themselves?
justice
o'connor
mr.
cohen,
explain
to
me
how
the
federal
power
act
should
be
interpreted
in
this
fashion
to
permit
in
effect
an
end
run
around
the
omission
in
the
power
act
of
authority
in
ferc
to
decide
in
the
first
instance
whether
a
generating
plant
should
be
built.
justice
o'connor
well,
why
isn't
it?
because
ferc
can't
decide
in
the
first
instance
whether
a
nuclear
generating
plant
should
be
built.
that
goes
to
the
states.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
it
rejected
it
but
a
neighboring
state
granted
it,
so
the
facility
was
purchased,
and
in
fact,
it's
an
integrated
system?
justice
o'connor
i
suppose
some
systemwide
review
makes
sense,
though,
doesn't
it?
justice
o'connor
and
that's
what
ferc
does.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
effect
might
be
to
veto
what
ferc
has
done,
in
effect.
justice
o'connor
but
the
practical
result
of
what
you
are
urging
might
be
just
that.
justice
o'connor
well,
ferc
has
required
that
mississippi
power
&
light
pay
for
one
third
of
the
nuclear
power
that
is
generated.
justice
o'connor
so
they
are
going
to
have
to
do
that
no
matter
what.
justice
o'connor
and
you
say
mississippi
can
now
make
a
determination
that
they
can
pay
for
it
but
none
of
that
cost
can
be
recouped?
justice
o'connor
mr.
maxey,
and
i
guess
you
also
clearly
litigated
before
ferc
how
much,
what
quantity
of
power
should
be
allocated
to
each
state
out
of
this
plant?
justice
o'connor
clearly,
the
quantity
issue
was
litigated.
justice
o'connor
along
with
price
and
costs.
justice
o'connor
so
the
question
is
whether
the
state
now
has
to
take
the
quantity
that
ferc
said
it
would
have
to
take,
and
that
was
litigated?
justice
o'connor
now,
if
it
were
lower
cost
power
being
distributed,
and
that
had
been
litigated
before
ferc,
and
this
was
the
lowest
cost
power
that
was
available,
i
guess
you
agree
that
nantahala
would
preclude
you
from
now
saying
the
state
can
order
a
different
quantity
to
be
sold
to
it?
justice
o'connor
did
you
understand
my
question?
justice
o'connor
suppose
that
this
power
that
we're
talking
about
turned
out
to
be
the
lowest
cost
power
rather
than
the
highest
and
ferc
had
litigated
the
quantity
and
price
question
as
it
did
here.
now,
you
don't
argue
that
mississippi
could
base
its
retail
rates
on
a
different
allocation
of
low-cost
power,
do
you?
justice
o'connor
oh,
you
do?
you
don't
think
nantahala
spoke
to
that?
