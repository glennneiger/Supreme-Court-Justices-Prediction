justice
stevens
mr.
lee,
can
i
interrupt
you?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
prudence
breaks
down
into
two
or
three
different
issues
as
to
whether
the
percentage
of
the
total
power
goes
to
the
state
is
prudent,
whether
the
wholesale
rate
is
prudent,
and
there
is
also
a
third
point
that
i
wanted
to
focus
on.
and
that
is
the
initial
investment.
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that
that
is
something
that
is
controlled
by
the
state,
by
means
of
issuing
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
the
original
construction?
justice
stevens
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
plant
is
in
mississippi?
justice
stevens
and
they
did
get
a
certificate
from
the
mississippi
commission?
justice
stevens
so
do
you
contend
that
that
decided
the
portion
of
the
prudence
issue
that
relates
to
whether
or
not
there
shall
be
a
plant
of
this
kind
at
all?
justice
stevens
mr.
lee,
you
are
proceeding
along
the
line
that
the
state
has,
you
mentioned
earlier
that
the
state
would
be
parochial
and
seek
to
defend
its
own
interests.
but
surely
a
state
is
allowed
to
do
that.
if
someone
comes
in
and
says
i
want
to
build
a
power
plant
that
is
going
to
serve
the
consumers
of
this
state,
it
is
also
going
to
serve
the
consumers
of
the
other
state,
and
they
really
need
it
more
than
our
consumers
do,
but
we're
being
nice
guys
and
we
want
to
serve
both.
surely
the
state
can
say
well,
that's
very
nice
but
we
have
our
consumers
in
mind.
can't
a
state
be
parochial
like
that?
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
maxey?
justice
stevens
supposing
that
it
appeared
during
the
ferc
proceedings
that
they
had
spent
$100
million
on
gold
doorknobs,
to
use
your
opponent's
example,
and
that
was,
although
the
whole
project
might
be
perfectly
wise
and
prudent,
that
particular
expenditure
was
imprudent
and
should
not
be
incorporated
into
the
rate
base
either
for
wholesale
rates
or
retail
rates.
could
mississippi
have
argued
in
that
proceeding
that
you
should
disallow
$100
million
of
cost
of
gold
doorknobs?
justice
stevens
yes.
before
the
ferc.
justice
stevens
so
you
could
have
at
least
argued
some
kinds
of
prudence
issues?
justice
stevens
but
you
tell
me
you
didn't.
you
didn't
raise
any
questions
of
prudence
at
all?
justice
stevens
then
why
wouldn't
mississippi
have
an
interest
even
at
the
wholesale
level
in
saying
look,
half
this
plant
is
totally
wasted
money.
you
should
back
out
half
of
the
capital
costs
and
not
build
it
into
the
rate
base?
you
certainly
had
an
interest
in
doing
that
at
both
the
wholesale
and
retail
levels
in
that
proceeding.
justice
stevens
it
just
wasn't
done.
but
it
certainly
could
have
been
done,
i
would
think.
justice
stevens
but
if
a
litigant
raises
the
issue
and
says
look,
this
is
just
a
lot
of
water
in
this
plant
that
we
should
take
out
of
the
capital
costs,
certainly
the
commission
would
review
that,
i
would
think.
justice
stevens
in
rising
above
it
it
has
to
consider
the
arguments
made
by
for
example
the
mississippi
commission
which
might
say
well,
look
at
all
this
waste
here
and
there
you
could
make
your
arguments
on
this
point.
at
least
that
is
one
forum.
justice
stevens
mr.
maxey,
could
i
ask
you
another
question?
is
it
your
position,
does
mississippi
take
the
position
that
the
whole
project
is
imprudent
and
that
all
the
capital
costs
should
be
absorbed
by
the
shareholders?
justice
stevens
theoretically,
then,
i
suppose
you
could
find
that
failure
to
make
a
proper
readjustment,
after
three-mile
island
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
that
there
is
a
certain
portion
of
the
costs
that
is
imprudent
and
therefore
that
the
rate
base
for
retail
purposes
would
be
different
than
the
rate
base
for
wholesale
purposes.
is
that
what
it
boils
down
to?
justice
stevens
i
see.
so
you
chip
away
at
the
rate
base
rather
than
totally
reject
the
whole
thing?
justice
stevens
your
answer
has
to
be
no,
because
you
are
saying
that
you
have
a
right
to
present
those
arguments
to
the
state
commission
regardless
of
what
the
federal
body
does.
that
seems
to
me
the
essence
of
your
position.
you
have
to
answer
that
no.
justice
stevens
you
are
arguing
it
could
be
prudent
at
the
wholesale
level
but
you
can
still
say,
mississippi
is
still
free
to
say
it
is
imprudent
at
the
retail
level.
justice
stevens
i
understand
your
position.
justice
stevens
so
there
would
not
be
a
res
adjudicata
bar
if
your
view
is
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
mississippi
case,
the
appellant,
mississippi
power
&
light
company
is
one
of
four
operating
companies
whose
voting
stock
is
wholly
owned
by
middle
south
utilities,
a
public
utility
holding
company.
the
four
companies
are
engaged
both
in
the
wholesale
sale
of
electricity
to
each
other
and
the
companies
outside
the
msu
system
and
in
the
retail
sale
of
electricity
in
separate
service
areas
in
louisiana,
arkansas,
missouri
and
mississippi.
through
msu,
the
four
companies
operate
as
an
integrated
power
pool
with
all
energy
in
the
entire
system
being
distributed
by
a
single
dispatch
center
located
in
arkansas.
wholesale
transactions
among
the
four
operating
companies
historically
have
been
governed
by
a
succession
of
three
system
agreements
which
were
filed
with
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
in
1951,
1973
and
1982.
the
system
agreements
have
provided
the
basis
for
planning
and
operating
the
company's
generating
units
on
a
single-system
basis
and
for
equalizing
cost
imbalances
among
the
four
companies.
through
the
1950s
and
into
the
1960s,
most
of
the
system's
generating
plants
were
fueled
with
oil
and
gas.
in
the
late
1960s,
the
system
sought
to
meet
projected
increases
in
demand
and
diversify
its
fuel
base
by
adding
coal
and
most
importantly,
nuclear
generating
units.
the
question
in
this
case
involves
the
prudence
of
the
decision
to
construct
and
complete
the
major
nuclear
power
plant
known
as
grand
gulf
unit
1
which
is
located
in
port
gibson,
mississippi.
that
plant
began
commercial
operations
on
july
1,
1985
after
years
of
planning
construction
and
complexed
proceedings
conducted
before
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
an
order
entered
by
the
federal
commission
allocating
the
power
produced
at
grand
gulf
among
the
four
companies
requires
this
appellant
to
purchase
33%
of
the
plant's
output
at
rates
which
are
determined
by
the
commission
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
the
mississippi
public
service
commission
subsequently
granted
appellant
an
increase
in
its
retail
rates
to
enable
it
to
recover
the
costs
of
its
purchases
of
grand
gulf
power.
on
appeal,
however,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
held
that
no
such
increase
could
be
granted
by
the
state
commission
without
first
examining
the
prudence
of
the
management
decisions
that
had
led
to
the
construction
and
completion
of
grand
gulf
1
over
the
period
of
years
that
i
have
described.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
mississippi
supreme
court
decision.
for
reasons
stated
at
some
length
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
conclude
that
the
federal
administrative
proceedings
have
preempted
the
prudence
inquiry
that
has
been
ordered
by
the
state
commission.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
have
joined.
