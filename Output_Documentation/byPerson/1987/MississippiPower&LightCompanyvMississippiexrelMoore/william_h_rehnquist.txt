chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
86-1970,
mississippi
power
&
light
company
v.
mississippi
ex
rel.
michael
c.
moore,
et
al.
mr.
lee,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
see
that
follows
as
the
night
the
day,
as
you
apparently
think
it
does.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lee,
you
are
really
arguing
for
a
very
drastic
departure
from
the
traditional
method
of
regulating
utilities.
i
mean,
the
return
on
the
fair
rate
of
the
utility
is
based
on
its
prudent
investment...
that
has
always
been
a
state
matter
before.
now,
you
are
saying
all
of
that
is
simply
taken
away
from
the
states.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
you
are.
if
a
state
can't
determine
the
prudence
of
an
investment,
one
of
its
main
controls
over
fixing
utility
rates
is
gone.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
cohen,
i
thought
mr.
lee,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
said
it
could
be
reasonably
argued
either
way
whether
ferc
had
decided
this
question
or
not.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
then
that
ferc
may
have
quote,
"decided"
close
quote,
as
you
would
use
that
term,
it,
simply
by
doing
nothing
when
nothing
was
presented
to
it
on
the
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
presently
open,
in
ferc's
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
maxey.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
action,
if
any,
did
the
mississippi
corporation
commission
take
in
1981
when
it
found
out
about
this?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
state
of
mississippi
attempt
to
litigate
these
kind
of
questions
before
the
ferc?
chief
justice
rehnquist
have
they
ever
said
in
any
of
their
opinions
that
they
had
the
authority
to
do
it?
or
are
you
just
not
that
familiar
with
their
opinions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
maxey.
mr.
lee,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases,
no.
86-1970,
mississippi
power
&
light
company
versus
mississippi
ex
rel.
moore,
