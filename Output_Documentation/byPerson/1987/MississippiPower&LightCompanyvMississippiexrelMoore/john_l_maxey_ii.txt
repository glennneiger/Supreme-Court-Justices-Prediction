mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
appellant
invites
the
court
to
take
action
the
result
of
which
will
be
the
transfer
of
a
substantial
amount
of
the
electric
utility
retail
rate-making
from
the
states
to
the
federal
government.
the
state
of
mississippi
and
the
mississippi
legal
services
coalition
submit
that
such
a
result
would
be
contrary
to
this
court's
prior
decisions,
to
the
enactment
of
legislation
by
congress...
the
federal
power
act...
and
to
important
policies
of
this
nation.
the
appellant
has
raised
the
significant
issues
on
a
record
that
is
far
from
complete.
if
mississippi
is
permitted
to
complete
its
regulatory
responsibilities,
we
submit
that
there
will
be
no
cause
for
this
court
to
take
the
extreme
step
urged
by
the
appellant.
after
describing
several
essential
facts
which
the
appellant
failed
to
describe,
we
would
like
to
summarize
that
part
which
mississippi
plays
in
the
dual
regulatory
system
contemplated
by
this
court
and
the
legislation.
mp&l
wears
three
hats
in
these
proceedings.
it
is
the
purchaser
of
wholesale
power.
it
is
the
seller
of
retail
power.
and
it
is
the
construction
manager
of
grand
gulf.
let
me
address
the
latter
first.
in
the
early
1970s,
the
operating
companies
of
the
middle
south
utilities
system
decided
to
make
a
large
investment
in
grand
gulf,
a
huge
nuclear
generating
facility.
they
did
this
to
produce
electricity
for
their
customers,
but
to
also
produce
a
large
return
on
their
investment
for
their
stockholders.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
no,
sir.
they
could
have
stopped
it
in
the
manner
that
it
was
presented
to
mississippi
at
the
time,
your
honor.
it
was
presented
as
a
certificate
for
a
license
to
construct
the
unit.
and
i
think
mississippi
clearly
had
the
power
to
reject
that
application
for
a
license.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
but
it
did
not.
no,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
your
honor,
the
question
raises
the
conflict
between
the
ferc
jurisdiction
to
rule
on
these
kind
of
multi-state
agreements
with
the
state's
rights
to
protect
itself
through
prudence
inquiries
when
those
rates
come
to
mississippi
as
retail
rates.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
well,
i
think
it
does,
at
a
wholesale
level,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
ferc
did
so
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
or
claims
to
have
done
so.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
but
it
did
not
do
anything
with
regard
to
the
prudency
of
the
retail
rats
which
are
those
paid
by
the
ultimate
consumer.
what
mississippi
seeks
to
do
at
this
point
is
to
be
able
to
carry
out
its
responsibilities
under
the
dual
regulatory
system
and
investigate
the
prudency
of
the
rates
that
are
flowing
to
it
from
this
system.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
mississippi
cannot
veto
what
ferc
has
done.
that
is
conceded.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
your
honor,
we
would
disagree
in
that
the
practical
result
would
be
to
establish
whether
mississippi
power
&
light
was
prudent
in
its
undertakings
as
a
retail
seller
of
power
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
that
is
correct.
our
position
is
that
the
shareholders,
i
mean
the
rate
payers
should
not
be
required
to
pay
for
the
imprudence
of
the
management
of
a
company
in
its
undertakings
to
sell
retail
power
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
this
is
based
on
the
fact
that
when
mp&l
decided
to
construct
this
unit,
it
made
representations
to
the
mississippi
public
service
commission
in
order
to
get
its
license,
and
it
did
so,
in
acknowledging
the
jurisdiction
of
mississippi
to
grant
or
reject
that
license.
it
said,
for
example,
that
the
cost
of
this
two-unit
plant
was
going
to
be
$1.4
billion
when
completed,
and
the
first
unit
would
be
completed
in
1979
and
the
second
in
1981.
it
also
represented
that
the
specific
methodology
that
would
be
used
to
allocate
both
the
costs
and
the
electricity
to
the
customers
was
that
which
was
going
to
be
put
in
place
before
the
ferc.
it
also
made
representations
that
the
retail
rate
payers
at
that
time
in
mississippi
really
had
no
need
for
the
electricity
to
be
produced
by
grand
gulf
but
it
would
be
valuable
in
the
future
and
it
would
accrue
to
the
benefit
of
the
rate
payers
of
mississippi
to
support
the
construction
of
this
plant,
but
they
wouldn't
have
to
pay
for
it
until
they
needed
it
and
they
wouldn't
have
to
take
the
power
until
they
needed
it.
mp&l
continued
to
serve
as
construction
manager,
supervising
all
phases
of
the
design
and
construction
of
the
facility.
we
now
know
that
the
cost
of
that
facility
skyrocketed
to
some
400
percent
of
the
original
estimations
so
that
the
completion
of
unit
i
alone
was
some
$3.6
billion.
the
demand
for
electricity
began
to
decline
during
this
period
shortly
after
construction
began,
and
the
cost
escalated,
so
that
mp&l
and
its
sister
subsidiaries
came
together
and
arrived
at
a
different
methodology.
the
plan
was
adopted
by
the
msu
companies
in
1908,
but
it
wasn't
presented
to
the
mississippi
public
service
commission
until
1981
and
then
it
was
revealed
only
through
cross
examination
of
one
of
the
company
officials
who
was
there
testifying
about
the
acquisition
of
substantial
capacity
other
than
grand
gulf,
a
coal-fired
plant
in
arkansas
called
independence.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
it
took
no
action
then.
in
1983,
it
reviewed
that
situation
and
found
that
the
representations
had
been
made
and
entered
an
order
making
a
finding
that
the
changes
had
taken
place
without
any
permission
being
given
by
the
mississippi
public
service
commission.
but
it
did
not
take
any
action
at
that
time.
the
president
of
mp&l
represented
to
the
commission
in
1981
that
irrespective
of
the
changes
that
had
been
made
by
the
operating
companies
with
regard
to
this
agreement
and
the
allocation
of
the
cost
and
electricity
from
grand
gulf,
that
the
public
service
commission
of
mississippi
still
had
the
authority,
it
had
the
ultimate
authority,
when
mp&l
decided
to
put
these
rates
into
the
retail
rate
structure.
of
course,
we've
heard
how
the
ultimate
'82
agreement
and
the
allocation
agreement
were
submitted
to
the
ferc
for
approval
and
after
being
modified
mississippi
ended
up
with
33
percent
instead
of
the
31.63
percent
that
mp&l
had
agreed
to
do
in
this
agreement
subsequent
to
the
certification
of
the
unit.
mp&l
then,
of
course,
came
to
the
mississippi
public
commission
to
obtain
the
rates
at
retail
to
pay
them
for
the
33
percent
allocation
of
grand
gulf.
prudence
of
mp&l's
actions
with
regard
to
its
acquisition
of
such
a
large
percentage
of
grand
gulf
was
acknowledged
as
an
issue
in
the
case.
but
the
mpsc
unilaterally
carved
that
out
and
it
was
not
addressed
by
the
public
service
commission.
matters
of
excess
capacity,
grand
gulf,
and
an
acquisition
of
some
coal-generated
capacity
from
independence
were
carved
out
of
the
proceedings
considering
the
grand
gulf
rates.
the
mpsc
issued
its
decision
then,
which
allowed
the
entire
33
percent,
or
100
percent
of
the
ferc
allocation,
to
go
into
effect
as
retail
rates
through
a
tiered
phase-in
plan.
when
that
was
appealed
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
the
issue
of
prudence
and
whether
or
not
the
state
had
fulfilled
its
regulatory
responsibilities
under
state
law,
was
the
principal
issue
before
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
and
of
course,
it
reversed
and
said
you
just
comply
with
state
law
in
order
to
be
able
to
adopt
rates
and
pass
them
on
to
the
customer
to
be
paid.
and
what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
did
is,
it
sent
it
back
to
the
public
service
commission
to
carry
forward
its
duties
and
responsibilities.
now,
we
talk
about
prudence,
and
we
chase
the
term
around,
and
it
is
a
bit
elusive.
but
in
this
context,
we
would
submit
that
a
fair
definition
would
be
what
was
the
quality
of
the
managerial
judgment
exercised
by
mp&l
as
the
company
with
the
exclusive
right
to
provide
adequate
electrical
service
to
its
retail
customers
at
a
price
both
fair
and
reasonable
to
those
customers
and
to
give
it
the
opportunity
to
earn
a
reasonable
rate
of
return.
prudence
takes
on
several
characterizations.
it
can
be
the
prudence
of
construction,
which
has
been
referred
to
earlier
in
the
arguments.
whether
mp&l,
for
example,
looked
at
the
cost
overruns.
did
it
examine
the
projections
of
costs
during
construction?
mp&l
was
in
a
peculiarly
advantageous
position
to
be
able
to
find
that,
since
it
was
the
construction
manager.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
no,
your
honor.
and
i
can't
tell
you
the
entire
reason,
but
the
issue
of
prudence
appeared
very
early
in
the
proceedings
before
the
ferc,
and
the
question
was
are
the
administrative
judges,
or
is
the
administrative
law
judge
that
is
going
to
hear
this
case
going
to
determine
the
matter
of
prudence?
and
he
said,
and
it
is
cited
in
several
of
the
briefs,
no,
we're
not
going
to
consider
prudence.
that's
not
the
office
or
province
of
the
ferc.
and
the
ferc,
or
anyone,
would
really
have
to
strain
and
torture
a
reading
of
that
record
to
come
up
with
any
finding
that
the
ferc
conducted
anything
that
might
resemble
a
prudence--
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
--yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
yes,
sir.
i
understand
your
question
to
be
at
the
ferc?
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
no,
sir.
they
were
not
raised
at
that
time.
they
were
preserved
in
the
retail
setting
to
mississippi,
to
the
appropriate
time,
which
would
be
at
the
time--
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
--that
just
wasn't
done.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
well,
it
could
have
been
done.
i
can't
argue
that
the
wholesale,
that
ferc
should
be
very
sensitive
to
the
prudency
at
the
wholesale
level.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
i
would
think
so,
too,
your
honor.
the
question
i
would
have
with
that
is
the
posture
that
ferc
has
before,
that
has
these
companies
before
it,
which,
all
of
which
are
concerned
with
the
allocation
of
the
ferc
of
that
plant,
because
some
may
need
it
and
some
may
not
need
it.
ferc
sort
of
rises
above
those
internecine
disputes
and
decides
what
it
thinks
is
fair
as
between
those
companies.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
yes,
sir.
absolutely.1
we
would
concur
in
that.
and
my
answer
stands
as
it
just
was
not
done
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
yes,
ma'am,
absolutely.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
yes.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
the
principal
issue
was
what
allocation
was
coming
to
each
state.
that
was
one
of
the
debates.
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
well,
it
was
litigated
in
the
sense
that
each
state
was
trying
to
get
an
allocation
that
was
most
suitable
to
them
at
the
time
or
at
least
i
think
each
state
was
trying
to
get
the
least
amount
it
could
take
so
as
to
avoid
the
high
cost
that
would
ultimately
be
passed
on
if
all
of
it
were
passed
on.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
we
don't
read
nantahala
with
the
same
reading
that
the
other
side
does.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
yes.
i
think
i
did.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
nantahala
says,
had
before
it
a
different
set
of
facts.
the
facts
were,
as
the
opinion
reflected,
that
there
was
only
one
source
of
power
flowing
to
nantahala
and
the
ratio
went
from
lower
cost
power,
more
than
the
entitlement,
then
it
raised
the
cost
in
the
other
state,
and
if
that
were
modified
as
it
were
by
the
north
carolina
utilities
commission,
and
they
took
more
of
the
lower
cost
entitlement
power
from
that
one
source,
then
it
raised
the
cost
in
tennessee.
so
there
was
a
seesaw
effect.
we
contend
here
that
there
is
present
both
before
this
court
in
the
record
and
before
the
public
service
commission
below,
the
availability
of
other
sources
of
lower
cost
power.
mississippi
power
&
light
has
a
history
of
off-system
purchases,
which
are
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
and
those
are
sources
of
perhaps
lower
cost
power.
the
point
that
we
would
make,
your
honor,
is
that
that
is
a
determination
that
has
yet
to
be
made.
it
is
to
be
made
by
the
mississippi
public
service
commission
sitting
before
the
evidence
which
it
has
assembled
and
raising
the
questions
of
whether
there
was
the
availability
of
lower
cost
power
that
could
be
used
in
the
pike
county
sense
to
reduce
the
ultimate
rates
to
the
retail
consumer.
whether
or
not
mississippi
power
&
light
exercised
prudence
in
reducing
the
risk
to
its
rate
payers
while
it
watched
these
construction
costs
escalate,
it
watched
the
price
of
oil,
which
had
been
projected
to
rise
to
astronomical
levels,
stay
under
$20.
what
did
it
do
during
this
period
of
time
when
three-mile
island
came
down,
or
occurred,
and
then
the
resulting
additional
regulatory
oversight
occurred
which
increased
the
cost?
what
did
mp&l
do
during
this
period
of
time
to
reduce
the
risk
to
the
rate
payers
of
mississippi
when
it
realized
that
the
cost
of
capital
had
increased
due
to
inflation?
those
are
matters
of
prudence
which
relate
to
the
rate
payers
of
mississippi
which
the
mississippi
public
service
commission
deserved
the
opportunity
under
our
dual
regulatory
system
to
continue
and
make
findings.
and
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
would
present
a
substantially
more
reliable
record
than
you
have
before
you
now.
the
nantahala
case
had
been
to
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
twice.
it
had
been
remanded
back
to
the
north
carolina
public
service
commission.
when
it
came
before
this
court,
it
had
been
thoroughly
reviewed
at
the
administrative
level
and
again
at
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
what
we're
attempting
to
do
is
perpetuate
litigation.
but
i
am
submitting
that
the
finality
of
the
order
before
you
is
subject
to
substantial
question
in
view
of
the
additional--
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
--no,
sir.
mississippi
takes
the
position
that
it
really
doesn't
know
what
it
is
going
to
find
in
the
way
of
prudence
when
it
conducts
the
prudency
inquiry.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
well,
there
are
a
number
of
ways,
yes,
sir,
that
that
could
be
accomplished.
and
we
have
seen
it
happen
in
one
of
the
subsidiary
companies
already,
that
explored
the
various
kinds
of
managerial
judgments
that
were
made
during
these
periods
of
time
and
made
the
attempt
to
avoid
bringing
any
conflict
of
its
jurisdiction
with
that
of
the
ferc,
in
an
effort
to,
rather
than
saying
the
all
or
none
kind
of
argument,
saying
we
have
to
live
together
in
a
dual
regulatory
system
and
we
recognize
that
the
ferc
has
issued
its
allocation
and
we're
not
going
to
take
from
the
company
the
ability
to
meet
that
payment
that
it
is
obligated
to
make
to
middle
south
energy
or
sere,
that
it
is
now
called.
but
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
we
are
going
to
try
to
reduce
the
ultimate
impact
on
the
rate
payers
as
a
result
of
the
imprudence
that
the
company
conducted
itself
during
that
period
of
time.
that
is
the
nature
of
the
exploration
that
would
be
made
by
the
public
service
commission
in
mississippi.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
rule
of
law
that
would
have
kept
mississippi
from
making
these
presentations
to
the
ferc.
there
is
an
election
of
forum
that
would
have,
that
gave
mississippi
the
chance
to
say,
we
understand
that
if
you
address
these
problems
at
the
ferc
level
they
will
be
at
the
wholesale
level.
but
we
want
to
have
a
determination
of
the
prudency
at
the
retail
rate
level
and
we
will
do
that
in
mississippi,
which
is
preserved
to
the
states
by
the
federal
power
act.
so
our
position
would
be
that
of
course
you
could
present
anything
that
the
administrative
law
judge
would
authorize
you
or
permit
you
to
introduce
at
that
point,
but
that
it
was
not
done
and
it
was
not
done
because
ferc
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
prudence
at
the
retail
level.
it
had
only
at
the
wholesale
level.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
your
honor,
i
suspect
that
the
opposing
side
would
raise
some
defense
like
collateral
estoppel
if
you
had
attempted
to
take
both
bites
at
the
apple.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
well,
it
is
the
position
that
the
roles
are
dual
and
that
they
sometimes
overlap
or
appear
to
overlap,
but
the
same
evidence
presented
with
regard
to
the
prudency
at
the
wholesale
level--
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
--yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
that's
absolutely--
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
--no,
sir,
we
would
argue
that
it
would
not.
we
would
suspect
that
the
other
side
would
argue
that
it
would,
however,
in
response
to
the
question.
but
we
think
that
there
is
absolutely
a
division
between
the
wholesale
and
retail
rate
making
that
is
set
up
by
congress,
the
federal
power
act,
and
while
the
two
may
appear
to
overlap,
that
the
two
have
very
different
functions
and
very
different
goals.
there
might
be
evidence,
of
course,
that
would
apply
to
both,
but
nonetheless,
in
the
final
analysis,
the
division
would
be
clear.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
john
l.
maxey,
ii
i
think
i'm
familiar
with
decisions
where
the
ferc
says
it
has
the
authority
to
consider
prudence,
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
an
example
of
sort
of
the
dual
regulatory
system
was
where,
in
a
case
that
was
cited
in
one
of
the
briefs,
i
believe
it's
the
union
electric
case,
that
where
the
state
had
conducted
a
prudence
inquiry
at
the
state
level
about
the
retail
rates,
and
then
carried
its
findings
to
the
ferc
and
said
we
found
imprudence
here,
and
we
would
like
to
have,
like
to
be
able
to
have
you
recognize
the
imprudence
at
the
ferc
level.
the
ferc
said
we
have
the
right
to
conduct
a
prudency
inquiry
and
we
may
take
into
consideration
what
the
state
has
found
but
we're
not
bound
by
it,
i
think,
thereby
recognizing
the
dual
regulatory
system
that
is
contemplated
by
the
federal
power
act,
and
ferc
is
trying
to
walk
the
line
to
do.
mp&l
claims
that
there
will
be
unlawful
shifting
of
prices
between
the...
or
costs,
rather...
between
the
operating
companies,
if
mp&l
grants,
if
the
mpsc
grants
less
than
the
full
pass-through
of
the
33
percent
to
mp&l.
that
is
certainly
not
borne
out
by
the
record.
the
other
three
operating
companies,
ap&l,
lp&l
and
nopsi,
have
all
taken
less
as
retail
rates
than
the
total
amount
that
has
been
allocated
to
them
by
the
ferc.
their
shareholders
have,
in
varying
measures,
absorbed
some
of
the
allocations
that
are
granted
to
them
by
the
ferc.
and
testimony
which
is
referred
to
in
the
briefs
indicates
that
that
has
not
resulted
in
a
shifting
of
costs
back
to
mp&l.
in
other
words,
an
absorption
by
lp&l
of
its
partial
allocation
has
not
resulted
in
costs
shifting
back
to
mississippi.
we
would
take
issue
with
that.
we
consider
that
the
federal
power
act
was
adopted
to
provide
the
regulation
of
interstate
wholesale
sales
of
electricity
and
expressly
created
the
dual
regulatory
system
which
this
court,
in
a
similar
fashion
recognized,
in
the
recent
case
of
federal
communications
commission
v.
louisiana
public
service
commission.
to
those
that
argue
that
this
interferes
with
the
efficiency
of
broad
regulation,
which
we
heard
this
morning,
this
court
has
admonished
that
the
courts
should
not
assume
a
role
which
our
system
has
assigned
to
congress.
now,
mp&l
seeks
to
move
these
lines
drawn
by
the
court
and
adopted
as
law
by
congress
under
the
guise
of
furthering
the
national
policy
of
economy
and
efficiency
in
the
delivery
of
electric
service.
but
that
in
fact
is
wrong.
that
would
defeat
the
efficiency
that
now
exists
in
the
electric
utility
rate
making.
for
example,
the
states
would
be
less
than
interested
in
granting
a
license
to
a
large
nuclear
power
plant
or
any
kind
of
power
generating
plant
today
if
it
knew
tomorrow
that
it
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
protect
its
citizens
and
constituents
which
it
has
elected
or
appointed
to
serve,
because
the
ferc
might
well
come
along
and
later
change
that
and
then
send
those
rates
right
back
to
them
as
retail
rate
payers
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
regulate
or
even
investigate
under
the
appellant's
theory.
this
is
not
an
isolated
case
which
compels
this
court's
decision.
in
fact,
we've
counted
some
22
states
that
would
be
directly
affected
because
they
have
utilities
that
are
involved
in
a
multi-state
pooling
arrangement
or
an
integrated
system.
this
is
a
case
which
will
have
an
impact
on
all
investor-owned
utilities
which
engage
in
any
such
interstate
pooling
or
joint
ventures.
the
appellant
raises
these
questions
of
widespread
and
harmful
potential
on
a
record
that
is
far
from
complete.
this
court
should
have
the
benefit
of
thorough
development
in
these
issues.
this
case
should
be
returned
to
mississippi
where
that
can
take
place.
thank
you.
