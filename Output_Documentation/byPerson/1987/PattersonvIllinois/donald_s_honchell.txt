mr.
donald
s.
honchell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
tyrone
patterson,
a
17-year-old
youth,
was
kept
in
custody
for
44
hours
without
confessing,
without
seeking
to
confess,
until
he
was
confronted
by
his
indictment,
and
he
asks
this
court
to
apply
the
safeguards
of
edwards
versus
arizona
and
michigan
versus
jackson
to
protect
his
constitutional
right
to
counsel,
which
was
automatically
applicable
upon
his
indictment.
there
is
no
dispute
that
that
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
attached
in
this
case,
that
it
apply
automatically
upon
the
indictment,
and
that
it
came
into
existence
without
request
or
action
or
demand
by
tyrone.
the
question
for
your
honors
is
a
narrow
one.
what
is
the
protection
of
that
right?
as
in
edwards,
as
in
jackson,
the
suitable
method
to
safeguard
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
to
bar
the
government
from
contact
with
the
accused
concerning
the
case
until
counsel
is
present
unless
the
accused
initiates
communication
with
the
authorities,
indicating
a
desire
and
willingness
to
discuss
the
case.
as
in
edwards
and
as
in
jackson,
this
is
the
only
fair
way
to
treat
a
defendant
whose
right
to
counsel
has
been
invoked
by
the
state
through
the
action
of
indictment.
in
this
cause--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--there
is
no
indication--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--yes,
that's
correct.
the
police
officer
returned
with
the
indictment
to
the
police
station
and
that
afternoon
confronted
him
with
the
indictment
before
the
accused
had
been
taken
to
court,
before
the
accused
had
been
transferred
to
another
facility
where
he
would
be
housed
until
taken
to
court.
it
is
clear
that
the
accused
was
about
to
be
removed
from
the
custody
of
the
investigating
officials,
and
that
they
used
that
opportunity
to
confront
him
with
the
indictment
in
order
to
prompt
a
statement
which
had
not
otherwise
been
obtained.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
no.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
heart
of
this
case.
the
heart
of
this
case
is
to
protect
the
sixth
amendment--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--the
question
once
the
sixth
amendment--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--yes.
yes,
he
certainly
can.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
the
question
before
the
court
is
not
the
knowledge
that
any
accused
needs
to
waive
sixth
amendment
rights.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
in
protecting
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
he
should
not
have
been
approached
with
any
information,
including
the
miranda
warnings,
and
it
would
not
be
the
proper
protection
for
this
court
to
decide
the
amount
of
knowledge
the
accused
should
obtain
for
knowing
an
intelligent
sixth
amendment
waiver.
it
is
not
the
issue
for
the
court
to
decide
what
additional
warnings
should
be
created.
the
question
is
the
protection,
and
it
is
our
assertion
that
just
as
this
court
decided
in
edwards
and
in
jackson
not
to
decide
what
knowledge
should
be
used
to
waive
right
to
counsel.
this
court
as
well
should
not
decide
how
much
knowledge
is
appropriate
for
waiver
of
counsel.
rather,
to
protect
from...
as
a
simple
and
easy
surrender
of
counsel.
the
court
should
protect
it
by
barring
any
question
by
the
authorities.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
exactly.
if
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel
were
under
consideration
the
authorities
could
secure
a
waiver
by
certain
knowledge.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
if
the
accused
asks
for
counsel
it
is
appropriate
to
protect
it
by
barring
any
contact
between
the
accused
and
the
authorities,
whether
it
involves
miranda
warnings,
super
miranda
warnings,
any
degree
of
information.
the
equivalent
protection
when
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
attaches
automatically
is
equally
to
forbid
providing
information
to
the
defendant
unless
the
defendant
initiates
the
interrogation
and
thereby
surrenders
the
control
of
the
interrogation
to
the
authorities.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
there
has
been
a
wide
variety
of
opinion
on
the
additional
warnings
beyond
miranda,
the
way
in
which
they
are
provided.
the
authorities
seem
to
indicate
that
the
accused
must
realize
the
significance
of
an
indictment
and
the
corresponding
significance
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
that
miranda
does
not
contain
provisions
by
which
the
accused
becomes
familiar,
and--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--the
additional
information
is
difficult
to
predict
as
a
matter
of
abstract
law.
the
additional
information
must
familiarize
him
that
he
has
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
which
attaches
automatically.
it
is
intended
to
protect
him--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--he
was
told...
the
word
"counsel"
was
used.
he
was
told
he
had
a
right
to
counsel.
but
not
through
information
by
which
it
would
become
meaningful
to
him,
because
the
method
that
was
used
was
not
designed
to
alert
the
accused
to
the
sixth
amendment
rights
to
counsel.
it
was
designed
to
offset
the--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--he
had
to
meaningfully
know
he
had
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
present
because--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--because
the
warning
here
used
did
not
convey
or
express
what
counsel
was
intended
to
do
for
him
after
indictment.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
that
there
is
a
right
to
counsel
who
would
act
on
his
behalf
and
represent
him.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
no,
there
is
nothing
in
this
warning
outside
pure
miranda.
miranda
was
not
designed
to
indicate
defense.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
that
is
a
possible
method,
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
no,
because
in
our
view
there
should
not
have
been
any
waiver
sought
through
miranda
warnings
or
otherwise
because
once
the
accused
is
indicted
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
attached
and
we
advocate
the
same
protection
that
this
court
created
for
indicted
defendants
or
for
defendants
benefitting
from
sixth
amendment
in
jackson
and
defendants
requesting
counsel
in
the
fifth
amendment
in
edwards.
in
those
two
cases
your
honors
did
not
say,
well,
the
additional
warnings
are
necessary,
or
miranda
is
enough,
or
we
are
going
to
allow
the
police
to
interrogate
the
defendants
and
get
a
warning.
your
honors
said
that
there
can
be
no
interrogation,
and
that
is
simply
the
equivalent
protection
that
this
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
should
provide.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
that's
correct,
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
ask
for
sixth
amendment
counsel
to
be
protected
by
it.
it
was
necessary
in
edwards
that
the
accused
invoke
his
right
to
counsel,
to
have
a
right
to
counsel
deserving
of
protection.
there
is
no
necessity
in
this
case
that
mr.
patterson
invoke
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
it
attached
automatically
upon
indictment.
the
question
then
becomes--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
i
don't
really
think
there
would
be
any
significant
difference.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
oh,
certainly.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
it
would
be
precisely
the
same
because
the
sixth
amendment
counsel
arises
merely
upon
being
indicted.
it
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin
when
a
defendant
faces
indictment.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
the
protection
in
either
situation
would
be
the
same,
and
it
is
to
bar
any
effort
at
getting
a
waiver,
no
matter
what
the
warnings
are.
there
is
a
bar
to
getting
a
waiver.
there
is
a
shield
around
the
accused
through
which
the
police
cannot
reach
the
defendant
to
obtain
a
waiver,
whether
there
is
warnings
specified
or
not,
and
it
is
this
inviolate
protection
which
cannot
be
penetrated.
the
control
of
the
questioning,
the
control
of
the
interrogation
belongs
in
the
hands
of
the
defendant.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
there
are
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
using
the
indictment
as
a
means
of
reaching
the
defendant.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
that
is
a
question
of
initiation,
and
we
would
resist
that
as
a
means--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--in
this
case
he
certainly
came
to
him.
he
not
only
told
him
he
was
indicted.
he
began
talking
to
him,
began
speaking
to
him.
when
the
accused
began
asking
some
questions,
if
the
defendant
had
wanted
to
speak
to
the
officer
there
was
plenty
of
opportunity
before
this
occasion
to
do
so.
if
the
defendant
is
to
be
told
of
the
indictment,
that
should
be
the
sole
procedure
that
occurs.
the
accused
is
informed
of
the
indictment.
there
is
no
follow-up
interrogation.
there
is
no
inquiry
that
it
come
from
a
neutral
party
such
as
a
member
of
the
jail
personnel
instead
of
the
investigating
officer,
that
the
accused
not
be
removed
from
a
cell,
taken
to
a
detective
bureau,
placed
within
the
confines
of
the
police,
and
thereby
put
within
their
control
and
allowed
to
be
asked
about
the
case
or
allowed
to
tell
his
statement
about
the
case.
the
police
should
not
manufacture
a
way
to
then
claim
the
defendant
initiated
the
interrogation.
when
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
attaches
in
this
case
without
any
effort
by
the
accused,
it
is
automatic,
the
fair
way
to
preserve
and
protect
that
sixth
amendment
counsel
is
to
use
the
method
this
court
itself
decided
was
the
fair
protection
in
the
edwards
case
and
later
on
in
the
jackson
case
when
the
sixth
amendment
was
at
stake,
and
using
the
information
here
as
a
means
of
reaching
the
defendant,
taking
the
control
away
from
the
accused
and
by-passing
that
shield
that
protects
him
from
interrogation
resulted
in
a
statement
which
was
quite
literally
in
violation
of
his
right
to
counsel,
and
therefore
we
would
ask
your
honors
to
use
in
this
case
where
counsel
is
equally
as
important
if
not
more
important
than
in
jackson
and
edwards
the
same
protective
mechanism.
bar
the
authorities
from
reaching
the
accused
unless
counsel
is
provided.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
it
has
to
be
exercised
to
be
protected,
and
the
police
can
seek
a
waiver
of
it.
this
is
what
miranda
decided.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
but
it
puts
the
control
of
the
interrogation
in
the
hands
of
the
police.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes,
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
because
it
is
a
much
broader
right
designed
for
much
greater
purposes,
and
it
has
been
the
consistent
policy
of
this
court
because
of
its
importance
to
the
trial
itself
that
it
attach
automatically
upon
indictment,
that
it
extend
to
pre-trial
proceedings
because
of
the
harm
done
to
the
accused
if
he
surrenders
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
because
before
this
court
decided
to
protect
a
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
it
required
that
it
be
exercised.
this
court
has
not
required
a
sixth
amendment
right
be
invoked.
the
fifth
amendment
right
which
exists
nevertheless
allows
the
police
to--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
when
the
accused
is
represented
by
counsel,
the
police
would
be
barred
from
seeking
him
unless
he
permits
the
police
by
contacting
the
authorities
when
he
invokes
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
or
in
any
application
of
the
sixth
amendment,
because
we
maintain--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--in
that
proceeding
i
think
i
would
indicate
yes,
he
could
be
approached
by
the
authorities,
because
by
waiving
his
right
to
counsel
at
the
arraignment
in
court,
it
would
be
an
indication
he
need
not
have
counsel,
but
i
think
if
the
accused
is
to
be
fully
protected
this
court
must
examine
the
extent
to
which
he
indicates
his
forfeiture
of
counsel.
if
he
simply
indicates
i
do
not
want
counsel,
that
would
not
be
an
indication
that
he
is
willing
to
discuss
the
case
with
the
authorities.
if
he
foregoes
his
right
to
counsel
and
in
addition
indicates
a
willingness
to
discuss
the
case
without
counsel,
the
authorities
can
then
proceed
to
get
the
waiver
through
the
particular
warnings,
but
if
the
accused
retains
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
by
not
communicating
with
the
authorities
a
willingness
to
discuss
the
case,
then
he
has
not
abandoned
his
sixth
amendment
right.
and
so
long
as
he
retains
that
sixth
amendment
protection
he
retains
control
over
the
interrogation.
this
is
the
distinction
which
appears
before
and
after
indictment.
where
should
the
control
over
the
questioning
be
placed?
and
wherever
the
control
is
placed,
it
indicates
the
protection
that
that
right
to
counsel
receives.
after
indictment
it
should
remain,
as
it
was
in
edwards,
as
it
was
in
jackson,
at
the
discretion
of
the
accused,
and
if
he
undertakes
to
forego
his
right
to
rely
on
sixth
amendment
counsel,
then
he
can
be
confronted
by
the
police,
but
until
he
does
so,
he
retains
his
right,
and
that
is
a
right
which
must
be
protected.
so
we
ask
your
honors
to
use
the
protection
which
was
appropriate
in
edwards
and
in
jackson
that
was
not
used
in
this
case.
the
state
here
seeks
to
use
miranda
warnings
as
protection
for
sixth
amendment
counsel.
we
ask
your
honors
to
restrict
miranda
to
the
moorings
in
which
it
arose--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--the
police
should
not
be
able
to
interrogate
the
accused
if
he
is
represented
by
a
lawyer.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
it
should
be
the
equivalent
protection.
if
he
is
represented
by
a
lawyer
or
he
has
the
right
to
be
represented
by
a
lawyer
he
cannot
be
approached
by
the
authorities.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
oh,
no.
i
understand.
no.
in
that
situation
the
accused
lawyer
would
need
to
know
of
the
police
action.
it
has
not
been
especially
decided
as
a
constitutional
issue,
but
in
order
to
protect
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
there
would
be
knowledge.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
i
don't
think
the
protection
would
change.
it
begins
at
the
time
of
indictment.
it
continues
throughout
the
pretrial,
trial,
and
post-trial
stages,
but
at
any
step
of
those
proceedings
the
defendant
can
initiate
contact
with
the
authorities,
send
word
that
he
wishes
to
speak
to
the
officials.
he
would
then
forego
his
right
to
rely
upon
the
sixth
amendment
protection,
and
if
there
is
counsel
introduced
in
the
case,
then
i
think
there
is
the
extra
protection
of
advance
knowledge
to
the
attorney
in
the
case,
but
at
no
time
after
indictment
should
the
police
be
allowed
to
approach
the
defendant,
begin
contact
through
a
waiver
procedure,
and
seek
a
statement.
the
protection
requires
that
the
accused
initiate
contact
with
the
police,
and
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
so
relying
on
the
constitutional
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
relying
on
its
protection
in
the
similar
situations
of
edwards
and
michigan
versus
jackson,
we
urge
that
your
honors
find
denial
of
sixth
amendment
counsel
in
this
case,
and
therefore
for
that
violation
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
facts
of
this
case
indicate
quite
vividly
the
need
for
the
protection
and
the
damage
that
can
happen
if
this
court
allows
an
indicted
defendant
to
be
approached
by
the
authorities.
this
is
a
17-year-old
youth
who
was
kept
for
44
hours
without
being
indicted,
without
going
to
court,
without
having
a
lawyer
appointed
for
him,
without
having
hired
a
lawyer,
and
during
that
time
the
police
allowed
him
to
sit.
after
keeping
him
for
44
hours
they
decided
that
they
were
going
to
get
an
indictment
against
him,
and
they
still
didn't
take
him
to
court
and
they
still
didn't
transfer
him
out
of
their
custody.
they
used
the
form
of
miranda
warnings.
miranda
warnings--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--what
we
do
have
to
protect
the
defendant
is
that
after
he
is
indicted,
he
is
not
to
be
approached
by
the
authorities
when
they
want
to
use
the
indictment
to
get
a
statement
from
him.
if
the
authorities
seek
an
indictment,
they
must
respect
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
they
did
in
this
case
get
an
indictment.
they
did
not
in
this
case
respect
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
and
we
are
in
that
very
vulnerable
period
when
the
accused
is
protected
by
the
automatic
attachment
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
and
before
he
reaches
court
where
he
can
meet
with
counsel
or
have
counsel
appointed,
and
it
is
in
this
narrow
period
of
time
when
we
are
asking
your
honors
to
protect
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes,
but
that
can
be
overcome
when
the
police
approach
him
and
want
to
discuss
the
case
with
him.
and
that
is
permissible
because
he
has
a
fifth
amendment
right
which
this
court
established
to
protect
in
custodial
settings
the
right
against
self-incrimination,
and
in
providing
that
right
this
court
provided
the
waiver,
but
the
state
is
not
seeking
a
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
right.
they
are
seeking
a
waiver
of
the
sixth
amendment
right.
that
is
established
in
the
constitution.
it
is
effective
only
if
it
can
protect
the
defendant
at
trial
from
easy
surrender.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
not
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
that
was
created
by
this
court
in
miranda
to
protect
the
right
against
self-incrimination,
but
it
is
not
intended
to
protect
the
sixth
amendment
right.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
there
is
no
constitutional
right
in
the
fifth
amendment
to
counsel,
but
miranda
said
we
are
going
to
apply
a
right
to
counsel
to
protect
against
self-incrimination,
and
we
are
going
to
allow
it
to
be
waived
when
the
police
want
to
use
this
procedure
of
warnings.
but
this
court
did
not
intend
that
that
right
be
the
equivalent
of
the
sixth
amendment
right.
this
court
did
not
intend
that
that
waiver
be
the
equivalent
of
waiver
of
the
sixth
amendment
right.
when
your
honors
decided
to
provide
a
waiver
mechanism
in
jackson
and
in
miranda...
i'm
sorry,
in
edwards
versus
arizona,
your
honors
decided
that
the
sensible
way
to
protect
that
right,
because
it
was
so
crucial,
becuase
it
was
not
the
equivalent
of
a
pretrial
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel
or
a
pretrial
miranda
right,
that
the
greater
the
right
required
greater
protection.
and
it
has
been
discussed
here
how
that
right
can
be
avoided,
that
you
can
secure
an
indictment.
the
police
now
want
to
get
a
statement
against
the
defendant,
although
our
authorities
slow
that
there
is
less
need
to
interrogate
after
there
are
formal
charges
than
before
because
there
is
some
indicia
of
evidence
against
the
defendant,
and
they
are
going
to
use
an
indictment
to
prod
a
statement
from
the
defendant,
so
they
are
going
to
use
it
as
a
weapon,
and
they
are
going
to
use
it
despite
the
fact
that
that
very
indictment
has
extended
sixth
amendment
protection,
and
it
is
this
very
method
that
was
used
in
this
case
when
the
accused
had
been
detained
for
such
a
long
period
of
time,
when
he
was
not
protected
by
counsel,
under
the
sixth
amendment,
which
has
been
consistently
viewed
as
automatically
applicable,
that
in
this
situation
the
control
must
be
in
the
hands
of
the
defendant.
the
defendant
can't
control
when
he
is
going
to
be
indicted.
the
defendant
can't
control
when
he
is
going
to
be
arraigned.
the
defendant
cannot
control
when
he
gets
counsel,
or
how
soon
he
will
get
counsel,
or
how
much
he
would
be
able
to
confer
with
counsel.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
no.
i
would
assume
counsel
would
not
be
appointed.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
no--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--you
would
indeed
have
the
right
to
counsel.
you
would
not
have
particular
counsel
appointed.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
at
arraignment
i
don't
know
if
a
counsel
would
be
appointed.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
at
the
trial
he
would
be
appointed.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
i
assume
for
purposes
of
the
arraignment
yes.
but
nevertheless
the
right
to
counsel--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
so
to
protect
the
right
we
ask
your
honors
to
apply
michigan
versus
jackson
and
edwards
versus
arizona.
