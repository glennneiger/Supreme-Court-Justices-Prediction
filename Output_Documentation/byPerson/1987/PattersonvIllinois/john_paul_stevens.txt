justice
stevens
mr.
honchell,
may
i
ask
you--
justice
stevens
--a
question
about
the
standard?
here
the
officer
right
after
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
went
back,
talked
to
him,
told
him
about
the
indictment.
would
the
case
be
different
in
your
view
if
there
had
been
a
two
or
three
hour
interval,
and
in
that
interval
there
had
been
a
counsel
designated
by
the
judge
to
represent
him,
but
there
was
not
an
opportunity
between
the
defendant
and
the
counsel
to
communicate,
and
the
officer
then
went
and
did
exactly
what
he
did
here,
gave
exactly
the
same
warning.
would
the
case
be
the
same,
in
your
view,
or
would
it
be
different?
are
we
talking...
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
counsel
has
in
fact
been
appointed?
justice
stevens
of
course,
there
would
be
a
very
serious
ethical
difference
between
the
two.
justice
stevens
but
in
constitutional
terms
i
suppose
the
cases
would
be
precisely
the
same.
justice
stevens
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
defendant
i
suppose
you
would
tell
him
the
same
thing
in
either
situation
and
he
could
waive
whether
he
really
has
a
lawyer
or
not.
he
could
say,
i
don't
need
to
talk
to
my
lawyer.
i
can
take
care
of
myself.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
if
i
may.
supposing
a
lawyer
had
been
appointed
for
him.
are
you
telling
me
that
this
protection,
the
edwards
business
of
having
the
police
initiate
the...
i
mean,
the
accused
initiate
the
conversation
would
be
adequate
protection
even
if
there
were
a
lawyer?
you
don't
think
there
would
be
any
duty
on
the
part
of
the
police
to
notify
counsel
who
had
actually
been
appointed
that
they
were
going
to
go
ahead
and
interrogate
the
man?
justice
stevens
so
you
would
say
there
should
be
greater
protection
if
he
has
actually
had
a
lawyer
appointed
for
him
than
if
he
had
not.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
see,
in
the
case
where
a
lawyer
has
been
appointed,
you
seem
to
be
conceding
that
it
would
be
perfectly
permissible
for
the
police
to
have
a
situation
arise
in
which
the
accused
initiates
some
kind
of
a
conversation
like
this.
justice
stevens
and
they
could
go
ahead
and
interrogate
him
without
ever
telling
a
lawyer.
justice
stevens
the
thing
that
puzzles
me,
and
it
kind
of
cuts
both
ways,
is
why
the
constitutional
protection
should
change
depending
on
the
timing
of
the
interrogation.
say
it
is
the
middle
of
the
trial
or
something.
couldn't
the
police
go
to
the
man
and
say,
you
know,
initiate
a
conversation
just
like
this,
give
him
his
miranda
warnings,
tell
him
he
has
got
a
perfect
right
to
have
a
lawyer
there,
but
create
a
situation
in
which
he
is
willing
to
talk.
why
can't
that--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your
opponent?
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
counsel
had
in
fact
been
appointed?
justice
stevens
so
in
other
words,
if
there
were
a
procedure
in
illinois
where
the
judge
would,
immediately
upon
the
return
of
an
indictment,
appoint
a
lawyer
for
the
man,
but
there
is
obviously
going
to
be
some
delay
before
they
get
together,
the
police
could
nevertheless
still
take
the
indictment,
go
to
the
man,
and
tell
him
about
the
indictment,
and
have
a
conversation
arise
like
this,
and
give
nothing
more
than
miranda
warnings,
and
that
would
be
adequate
protection?
justice
stevens
so
his
rights,
at
least
until
he
has
talked
to
the
lawyer
and
the
lawyer
has
given
him
some
additional
advice,
his
rights
after
indictment
and
before
indictment
in
this...
in
a
custodial
setting
are
precisely
the
same.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
there
is
an
additional
provision
of
the
constitution
to
rely
on,
but
as
a
practical
matter
they
are
exactly
the
same.
justice
stevens
what
about,
say,
a
week
after
he
had
met
with
the
lawyer,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
actually,
then
he
knew
that
he
had
a
lawyer.
you
would
still
say
the
same
thing,
it
is
okay
for
the
prosecutor
to
go
talk
to
him?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
there
is
this
difference,
is
there
not?
the
police
have
an
additional
fact
that
may
prompt
further
conversation.
namely,
they
can
go
in
and
say,
now
you
have
been
indicted.
the
facts
are
a
little
different
than
they
were
yesterday.
isn't
that
of
some
significance
in
perhaps--
justice
stevens
--i
mean,
it
might
be
helpful
to
the
police
in
encouraging
him
to
talk,
that
this
is
more
serious
than
it
appeared
yesterday,
because
now
a
grand
jury
has
returned
an
indictment--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
as
a
matter
of
practice
before
indictment
when
the
warnings
are
given
and
he
knows
all
this
about
getting
a
lawyer,
how
often
does
cook
county
actually
provide
a
public
defender
for
a
person
before
he
has
been
indicted?
does
it
ever
happen?
justice
stevens
yes,
during
a
pre-indictment
custodial
interrogation
the
miranda
warning
is
given
saying
you
are
entitled
to
a
lawyer
and
all
this.
do
they
ever
actually
appoint
a
public
defender
before
an
indictment?
justice
stevens
so
that
really...
that
warning
is
a
little
misleading,
i
think,
pre-indictment,
isn't
it?
how
does
he
get
the
lawyer?
he
says,
i
want
a
lawyer.
what
happens?
justice
stevens
yes.
they
just
stop
questioning
him,
don't
they?
justice
stevens
what
is
a
pd?
justice
stevens
there
might
be
a
public
defender
there,
but
the
police
actually
go
out
and
find
one
for
him?
is
that
the
practice?
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
i've
ever
heard
of--
justice
stevens
and
i
suppose
you
would
think
it
would
be
proper
for
the
prosecutor,
not
just
the
police,
to
go
in
and
tell
the
defendant
about
the
indictment
and
let
him
have
a
chat
with
the
defendant.
that
is
perfectly
all
right,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
let
the
lawyer
do
it,
because
he
is
probably
professionally
better
trained
even
than
the
police,
and
he
is
probably
better
able
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
true
facts.
justice
stevens
that
would
be
an
approved
procedure,
to
have
the
lawyer
go
to
his
adversary
without
counsel
and
talk
with
him.
justice
stevens
i
suppose
the
police
can
always
try
to
play
games
with
this.
if
we
hold
the
way
petitioner
wants
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
say
that
there
would
be
an
incentive
on
the
part
of
the
police
to
delay
an
indictment.
justice
stevens
in
order
to
be
able
to
talk
to
him.
justice
stevens
isn't
there
some
limit
on
the
period
time
they
can
hold
a
man
in
custody
without
charging
him?
justice
stevens
they
can't
just
delay
indefinitely.
justice
stevens
without
giving
notice
to
the
lawyer,
that
would
be
perfectly
all
right?
justice
stevens
well,
he
accepted
the
lawyer--
justice
stevens
--but
then
as
the
proceeding...
critical
stage
number
2
is
a
lineup.
we
have
already
questioned
him,
but
we
now
have
a
lineup.
you
go
to
the
man
without
telling
the
lawyer
and
say,
you
have
a
right
to
have
the
lawyer
there,
but
would
you
be
willing
to
waive
it?
justice
stevens
supposing
the
conversation
develops
this
way.
they
go
to
him
and
say,
we
have
scheduled
a
lineup.
so
they
initiate
the...
they
certainly
have
a
right
to
tell
him
that,
just
like
they
told
him
here,
you
have
been
indicted.
and
then
they
go
ahead,
then
proceed
and
say,
we
can
go
ahead
without
counsel
if
you
are
willing
to
do
it.
you,
of
course,
realize
you
have
a
right
to
have
your
lawyer
there.
would
that
be
consistent
with
the
sixth
amendment
protection
if
they
don't
tell
the
lawyer?
justice
stevens
i
am
saying
they
initiated
precisely
as
it
is
here.
they
told
him
about
the
indictment
here.
they
tell
him
about
the
lineup
in
my
hypothetical.
why
is
that
different?
justice
stevens
well,
supposing
they
tell
him,
look,
we,
can
either
go
ahead
with
the
lineup
right
now,
because
we've
got
these
people
here,
or
we
can
tell
your
lawyer
about
it
and
arrange
it
at
a
time
that
is
convenient
for
him,
what
do
you
want
to
do,
and
he
says,
i
will
go
ahead
without.
can
they
do
that
without
telling
his
lawyer?
justice
stevens
is
there
any
constitutional
objection
to
their
doing
that
without
telling
his
lawyer?
justice
stevens
well,
i
have
given
you
the
facts.
they
initiate
just
like
they
did
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
maybe
the
man
never
said
a
word
at
all.
he
went
in
court,
they
appointed
a
lawyer
for
him,
and--
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
fact
is
different
when
he...
it
is
warnings
plus
indictment
in
this
situation.
before
it
is
just
warnings.
is
that
a
difference?
or
maybe
you
think
it
isn't.
justice
stevens
can
you
get
a
faretta
waiver
in
illinois
by
just
being
silent?
he
tenders
you
counsel
and
you
say
nothing,
the
judge
won't
appoint
a
lawyer
for
you?
