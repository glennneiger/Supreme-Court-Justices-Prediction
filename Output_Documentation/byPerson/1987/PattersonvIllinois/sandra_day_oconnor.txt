justice
o'connor
mr.
honchell,
i
guess
at
bottom
we
are
concerned
with
knowing
whether
the
defendant
knowingly
and
intelligently
waived
his
right
to
have
counsel
present
for
questioning.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
our
concern
would
be
whether
he
had
waived
his
right
to
have
counsel
present.
justice
o'connor
a
defendant
can
waive
his
right
to
have
counsel
present,
can
he
not?
justice
o'connor
and
what
information
precisely
do
you
think
is
needed
beyond
what
this
defendant
was
told
in
order
to
be
able
to
make
that
decision?
justice
o'connor
did
he
need
any
information
beyond
what
he
was
given
in
order
to
make
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
pincus,
even
if
a
lawyer
has
been
appointed,
you
think
there
is
no
obligation
whatever
on
the
part
of
the
police
to
let
the
lawyer
know
they
are
going
to
be
approaching
the
defendant
with
a
request
for
waiver
of
presence
during
the
lineup?
justice
o'connor
no,
the
lawyer
has
been
appointed.
no,
i
said
the
lawyer
has
been
appointed.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
pincus,
what
about
this
point
of
possible
manipulation
of
arraignment
time
to
allow
more
room
for
the
police
to
approach
the
defendant
if
we
were
to
adopt
your
rule?
