justice
kennedy
do
we
know,
counsel,
in
this
case,
what
arrangements
had
been
made
for
his
arraignment
after
the
indictment?
justice
kennedy
he
was
indicted
in
the
morning,
i
take
it,
on
the
23rd.
justice
kennedy
does
the
record
say
that
an
arraignment
hearing
had
been
scheduled?
justice
kennedy
counsel,
can
the
police
delay
the
indictment...
or
the
arraignment
for
a
few
hours
in
order
to
talk
to
him
a
little
bit
more?
justice
kennedy
yes,
suppose
he
is
indicted
at
10:00
in
the
morning
and
the
judge
is
available
for
arraignment
any
time.
can
they
delay
the
arraignment
until
about
4:00
in
the
afternoon
while
they
talk
to
him
with
a
miranda
warning?
justice
kennedy
there
is
no
duty
to
arraign
as
promptly
as
possible?
justice
kennedy
well,
under
the
rule
you
propose
there
would
be
an
incentive
to
delay
arraignment,
would
there
not?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
i
take
it
at
arraignment
the
judge
has
the
obligation
to
give
a
more
full
explanation
of
rights
than
just
a
miranda
warning.
would
the
constitution
be
satisfied
if
a
judge
gave
a
miranda
warning
at
the
arraignment
and
let
it
go
at
that?
justice
kennedy
well,
he
gives
the
miranda
warning
off
the
card.
is
that
enough?
no.
justice
kennedy
you
think
arraignment
proceedings
are
no
more
extensive
than
just
reading
miranda
rights?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
are
really
then
waiving
counsel
for
trial.
yes,
you'd
need
more
than
that.
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
yes.
so
then
there
is
again
the
incentive
to
delay
arraignment
if
the
police
want
further
interrogation.
justice
kennedy
but
if
we
do
rule
for
you,
do
you
think
it
is
justifiable
to
delay
arraignment
in
the
hopes
that
a
miranda
warning
will
elicit
this
kind
of
confession?
justice
kennedy
and
do
you
think
that
is
desirable
and
sound
policy?
