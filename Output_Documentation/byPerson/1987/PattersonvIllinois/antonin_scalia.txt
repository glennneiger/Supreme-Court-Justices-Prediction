justice
scalia
mr.
honchell,
would
you
just
indulge
justice
o'connor
and
me?
let's
assume
that
in
our
wrong-headedness
we
do
think
that
the
issue
is
whether
the
accused
made
a
conscious
and
intelligent
waiver.
would
you
answer
the
question
whether
there
is
any
information
here
that
he
would
have
needed
to
know
that
was
necessary
for
an
intelligent,
conscious
waiver,
that
he
didn't
have?
justice
scalia
but
for
the
waiver
in
this
incident,
for
the
waiver
that
would
make
admissible
these
confessions,
what
additional
information
would
he
have
had
to
know
to
make
his
waiver
of
counsel
at
those
confessions
conscious
and
intelligent?
justice
scalia
he
was
told
that,
wasn't
he?
he
was
told
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel.
justice
scalia
i
must
say
i
don't
understand
what
you
are
saying.
you
mean
they
should
have
said
you
have
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
instead
of
just,
you
have
a
right
to
counsel?
he
knew
that
he
had
a
right
to
have
counsel
present
before
the
made
the
confession.
now,
what
in
addition
did
he
have
to
know
to
make
the
waiver
an
intelligent
one?
justice
scalia
--mr.
donatelli,
i
suppose
we
have
been
talking
about
whether
counsel
has
been
appointed.
i
suppose
you
really
don't
have
counsel
until
you
agree
to
have
that
person
represent
you.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
the
mere
fact
that
the
court
has
named
a
counsel,
that
merely
authorizes
that
individual
to
come
to
the
defendant
and
say,
will
you
have
me
represent
you,
but
the
court
can't
appoint
a
counsel
really.
justice
scalia
more
important,
he
wasn't
asked
to
waive
counsel
at
trial
here.
he
was
asked
to
waive
counsel
at
this
immediate
interview.
justice
scalia
supposing
this
had
been
a
lineup
after
post-indictment
lineup,
and
he
gave
similar
warnings,
said,
you
don't
have
to
have
your
lawyer
there,
we
would
like
to
have
the
lineup
right
away.
a
lawyer
has
been
appointed
for
him.
could
he
waive
that
sixth
amendment
right
to
have
his
lawyer
attend
the
lineup
by
just
response
to
the...
in
jail
response
to
questions
like
these?
justice
scalia
just
change
them,
say
we
are
about
to
have
a
lineup
and
so
forth,
and
we
want
you
to
know
you
have
a
right
to
have
your
lawyer
there,
would
you
like
to
go
ahead
without
it?
would
that
be
sufficient?
justice
scalia
--so
this
case
would
be
different
if
there
had
been
an
arraignment?
you
acknowledge
that
had
there
been
an
arraignment
and
then
they
approached
him
for
this
interrogation,
it
would
be
no
good?
justice
scalia
he
had
accepted
counsel
appointed
during
the
arraignment.
justice
scalia
if
those
are
problems,
i
mean,
if
that
length
of
time
is
a
problem,
that
is
surely
a
separate
one.
i
mean,
maybe
we
should
have
a
two-hour
limit
on
how
long
you
can
hold
before
indictment,
or
how
long
after
indictment
you
can
hold
before
arraignment,
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
whether
there
was
a
voluntary
waiver
of
counsel
here?
justice
scalia
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
before
the
indictment,
of
course,
too,
right?
justice
scalia
fifth
amendment
right
is
not
established
in
the
constitution?
justice
scalia
we
just
sort
of
made
that
up.
that
is
not
in
the
constitution
at
all?
justice
scalia
for
purposes
of
the
whole
proceeding
unless
there
is
a
faretta
type
waiver.
justice
scalia
isn't
that
true?
