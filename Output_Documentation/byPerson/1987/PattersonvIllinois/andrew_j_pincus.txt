mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
take
as
our
starting
point
in
ascertaining
whether
the
miranda
warning
supplied
petitioner
with
the
information
that
he
needed
for
a
knowing
waiver
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
at
the
pre-trial
interrogation.
the
test
that
this
court
has
announced
several
times
in
evaluating
the
knowing
standard
of
a
waiver,
whether
the
suspect
knew
the
nature
of
the
right
being
abandoned
and
the
consequences
of
the
decision
to
abandon
it.
taking
the
first
part
of
that
test,
miranda
warnings
expressly
convey
to
petitioner
the
substance
of
his
sixth
amendment
right.
they
told
him
that
he
had
a
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
the
interrogation,
and
we
think
that
is
the
right
itself,
and
it
is
hard
to
argue
that
the
warnings
do
not
convey
that
knowledge
of
the
right.
the
miranda
warnings
also
inform
petitioner
the
consequences
of
his
decision
to
waive
that
right,
first,
that
he
would
not
have
the
assistance
of
a
lawyer
in
deciding
whether
to
speak
or
to
stand
on
his
right
to
remain
silent,
and
second,
that
if
he
chose
to
respond
to
the
questions
that
he
would
run
the
risk
that
his
uncounselled
answered
would
create
incriminating
evidence
that
could
be
introduced
against
him
at
trial,
and
we
think
again
that
is
the
consequence
of
the
decision--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
the
court
has
held
that
it
is
a
right
that
attaches
on
indictment
and
that
applies
in
various
critical
pretrial
proceedings.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
at
trial
and
at...
the
court
has
held
it
also
encompasses
various
pretrial--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
we
think
that
all
it
waived
was--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it
waived
his
right
to
counsel
at
the
interrogation
that
was
about
to
take
place.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
it
was
limited--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
it
is
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel
at
this
pretrial
proceeding.
the
court
has
made
clear
that
the
right
to
counsel
attaches,
in
addition
to
a
general
right
at
trial,
it
is
a
right
that
comes
into
play
in
critical
pretrial
proceedings
such
as
interrogation--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
we
don't
think
it
conveyed
to
him
the
knowledge
of
what
the
assistance
of
counsel
embodies
at
trial.
that
is
obviously
the
assistance
of
counsel
in
a
variety
of
other
procedures
that
take
place
at
trial,
cross
examination,
the
rules
of
evidence,
and
things
like
that,
and
we
think
that,
as
the
court
indicated
in
faretta,
there
would
have
to
be
a
colloquy
or
a
warning
that
gives
the
defendant
the
information
about
what
is
going
to
happen
at
trial
so
he
can
knowingly
decide
whether
he
wants
a
lawyer
to
assist
him
with
those
procedures.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
as
i
tried
to
indicate
before,
i
think
you
are
right,
justice
scalia,
that
it
was
clear
that
this
was
just
a
limited--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
we
think
these
warnings
wouldn't
be
adequate
because
they
refer
to--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
we
think
that
that
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
right.
we
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
gives
the
right
to
the
defendant,
not
to
the
lawyer,
and
it
is
the
defendant's
assertion
of
his
right
to
counsel
that
controls,
that
controls...
that
controlled
in
michigan
against
jackson
and
that
we
think
controls
in
this
case,
too.
if
the
defendant--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
assumed
the
question
was
that
the
lawyer
had
not
been
appointed,
and
an
arraignment
or
some
other--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
not
as
the
result
of
any
request
by
the
defendant.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
if
it
is
the
result--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
think
i
misunderstood
your-question
justice
stevens.
we
think
that
if
the
defendant
evidences
an
attempt
to
proceed
with
counsel
either
by
requesting
counsel
at
the
arraignment
or
having
his
own
counsel
there
by
his
side
at
the
arraignment,
but
then
the
edwards/michigan
against
jackson
type
of
rule
would
apply,
and
the
police
could
not--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
think
the
question
there
would
be
whether
there
had
been
an
initiation,
whether
who
had...
who
had
approached
whom,
and
i
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
the
difference...
well,
the
difference
with
this
case
is
that
in
the
hypothetical
the
defendant
had
asserted
his
right
to
counsel,
so
then
there
is
a
question
of
who
initiated
the
interrogation.
we
think
that
petitioner
is
quite
wrong
in
saying
that
michigan
against
jackson
should
be
transformed
into
a
rule
that
takes
effect
upon
the
assertion
of
the
right
by
the
defendant
into
a
rule
that
takes
effect
upon
the
attachment
of
sixth
amendment
rights
in
the
air
without
any
decision
by
the
defendant
that
he
wants
to
proceed
with
the
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
again,
your
honor,
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
think
the
question
would
be
who
initiated
the
inquiry,
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
again,
it
is
not
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
in
that
case
the
defendant
has
already,
as
in
michigan
against
jackson,
asserted
that
he
wants
to
proceed
with
counsel.
this
defendant
has
not...
did
not
ever
assert
that
he
wanted
to
proceed
with
counsel.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
he
evidenced
that
he
wanted
to
proceed
with
counsel
in
that
way,
by
adopting
that
lawyer
as
his
lawyer.
otherwise,
the
lawyer
couldn't
represent
him.
in
this
case
we
think
it's
fundamentally
different,
and
in
fact
the
court--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--if
there
had
been
an
arraignment
and
he
had
requested
counsel
or--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
then
it
would
be
controlled
by
michigan
against
jackson.
we
think
the
difference
here
is
that
michigan
against
jackson
doesn't
apply,
and
the
court
in
michigan
against
jackson
said
in
fact
that
the
request
for
counsel
at
the
arraignment
was,
and
i
am
quoting,
"an
extremely
important
fact
in
considering
the
validity
of
the
waiver.
"
and
we
think
that
is
the
important
fact
that
is
missing
here,
and
that
is
what
changes
the
case.
the
defendant
has
not
made
the
choice
to
be
represented
by
counsel,
and
what
underlies
michigan
against
jackson
and
edwards
against
arizona,
the
two
prophylactic
rules,
is
the
fear
that
the
police
will
try
and
get
the
defendant
by
badgering
him
to
change
his
mind
where
he
had
previously
asserted
his
right
to
counsel
and
agree
to
be
interrogated
and
what
the
court
said
is,
we
are
not
going
to
let
the
police
initiate
once
the
defendant
has
made
his
choice,
and
that
is
all
we
are
asking
for
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
the
prosecution
controls
both
for
the
time
of
indictment
and
for
the
time
of
arraignment,
so
we
don't
think
that
really
it's
going
to
make...
moving
the
time
back
to
indictment
will
just
introduce,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
the
possibility
that
the
indictment
could
be
pushed
back.
there
are
time
limits
on
both.
we
think
there
are
time
limits
on
arraignment
in
illinois,
and
we
think...
and
in
most
systems,
and
we
think
there
is
control...
there
is
some
control,
and
either
rule
will
not
completely
bar
the
government
from
doing--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
the
miranda
warning
elicits
the
confession,
but
i
think
that
the
prosecutor
could
delay
the
time
of
arraignment,
but
it
doesn't
change--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
think
it
depends
upon
the
particular
case.
there
is
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
the
prosecutor
telling
the
defendant
his
rights
and
seeing
whether
the
defendant
is
willing
to
talk
to
him.
the
warnings
give,
unlike
what
counsel
for
petitioner
said,
the
warnings
themselves
give
the
defendant
control
over
the
interrogation.
if
he
asserts
his
right
to
counsel,
he
will
be--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
we
don't
think
he
has
to
be
told
that
he
was
indicted
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
valid
waiver.
the
officers
can
tell
him,
and
we
don't
think
that
that
fact
changes
the
calculus,
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief,
in
any
meaningful
way.
as
i
was
saying,
justice
kennedy,
we
think
the
control
is
always
in
the
hands
of
the
defendant.
he
is
given
the
warnings.
he
is
told
of
his
rights,
and
he
can
decide.
if
he
wants
counsel
then
he
knows
he
has
a
right
to
it
and
he
can
stop
the
interrogation
right
then
and
there
until
he
has
counsel,
and
we
think
that
really
disposes
of
any
problem,
because
the
defendant
has
control
over
the
proceeding.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
he
can--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--your
honor,
that
is
what...
he
may
not
be
able
to
physically
stop
it,
but
he
can
prevent--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the...
any
statements
from
being
introduced
against
him,
so
he
can
protect
himself
effectively.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
