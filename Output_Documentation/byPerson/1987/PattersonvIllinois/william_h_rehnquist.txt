chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
86-7059,
tyrone
patterson
against
illinois.
very
well.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
honchell.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
difference
between
meaningfully
knowing
and
knowing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
then
you
say
in
answer
presumably
to
justice
o'connor's
question
and
justice
scalia's
question
he
would
have
had
to
be
told
more
about
what
counsel
would
do
for
him
after
indictment
before
he
could
intelligently
waive?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
think
this
warning
gave
him
the
impression
that
there
was
a
right
to
counsel
who
would
act
on
his
behalf
and
represent
him?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
okay.
so
it
should
have
said,
in
addition
to
saying
counsel,
counsel
who
would
act
on
your
behalf
and
represent
you?
that
would
have
been
the
magic
solution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
think
that
would
have
made
this
case
come
out
differently,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
edwards
we
said
there
could
be
no
interrogation
when
the
defendant
has
said,
i
want
counsel.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
now
here
nothing
equivalent
to
that
happened,
did
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
justice
white's
question
was
what
if
he
is
told
he
has
the
sixth
amendment
right
at
arraignment.
he
says,
no,
i
don't
want
a
lawyer.
i
understand
it
all.
i
don't
want
a
lawyer.
can
the
police
then
go
to
him,
and
giving
him
his
miranda
warning,
ask
him
questions.
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no,
surely.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
honchell.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
donatelli.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
donatelli,
as
things
actually
work
in
cook
county,
illinois,
would
a
court
ordinarily
appoint
a
counsel
for
a
defendant
when
the
defendant
wasn't
present
at
an
arraignment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
donatelli.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
mr.
honchell,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
honchell.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-7059,
patterson
against
illinois
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
