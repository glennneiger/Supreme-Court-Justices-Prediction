justice
white
or
affording
any
opportunity
to
try
to
waive?
justice
white
unless
he
asked
for
counsel.
justice
white
here
is
a
police
officer
comes
to
tell
him
about
the
indictment.
i
suppose
they
could
do
that,
or
not?
do
they
have
to
write
him
a
letter,
or
what?
justice
white
well,
the
officer
comes
anyway
and
tells
him
about
the
indictment,
and
the
defendant
then
says,
by
the
way,
i
want
to
make
a
statement
and
i
don't
care
to
have
a
lawyer
present.
justice
white
well,
the
officer
came
to
him.
justice
white
well,
in
the
fifth
amendment
case,
there
is
pre-charge
interrogation,
in
custody?
justice
white
there
is
a
right
to
a
lawyer,
isn't
there,
right
then
and
there?
justice
white
but
it
doesn't...
it
really
has
to
be
exercised,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
yes.
well,
they
interrogate
him
even
though...
they
start
to
interrogate
him
and
notify
him
about
miranda,
and
they
can
go
on
and
interrogate
him
unless
he
says,
i
want
a
lawyer.
justice
white
when
there
is
an
indictment
the
right
to
counsel
attaches.
justice
white
well,
under
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
white
but
why
shouldn't
it
have
to
be
exercised,
just
like
in
the
fifth
amendment
case?
justice
white
yes,
but
you
have
been
analogizing
this
to
the
edwards
situation.
justice
white
and...
but
of
course
in
edwards
there
was
an
exercise
of
the
right
to
counsel.
justice
white
there
was
an
exercise
of
it.
the
right
was
already
there.
justice
white
and
the
indictment
here
means
you
have
a
sixth
amendment
right.
why
shouldn't
it
have
to
be
exercised?
justice
white
well,
massiah
and
other
cases
like
that,
the
lawyer
was
actually
appointed.
justice
white
or
hired,
or
something.
justice
white
and
if
he
had
been
arraigned,
if
he
been
arraigned
and
he
says,
i
don't
want
a
lawyer--
justice
white
--would
you
still
have
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
that
you
couldn't...
that
you
couldn't
violate
by
going
to
him?
justice
white
well,
suppose
counsel
has
been
appointed
and
counsel
has
conferred
with
him
and
the
police
know
that.
then
may
the
police
go
and--
justice
white
--exactly.
justice
white
of
course,
we
don't
need
to
decide
that
issue
here.
justice
white
what
is
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel?
is
it
the
right
to
counsel
at
trial,
or
what?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
is
a
right
to
have
counsel
at
trial,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
waiver
that
was
given
here
waived
his
right
to
counsel
at
trial?
justice
white
what
did
it
waive?
justice
white
and
it
didn't
waive
anything
else?
justice
white
it's
a
waiver
but
it
isn't?
justice
white
why
isn't
this
good
to
waive
counsel
at
trial?
justice
white
what
if
at
the
arraignment
the
judge
says,
you
have
the
right
to
counsel,
and
tells
him
all
about
it,
now,
if
you
want
counsel,
speak
up,
and
he
doesn't
say
a
word.
do
you
think
that
counsel
is
going
to
be
appointed?
justice
white
so
you
have
to
exercise
your
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
justice
white
there
you
are
at
arraignment,
here
this
right
is
attached,
and
if
you
want
counsel,
you
have
to
exercise
it,
you
have
to
ask
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
illinois
--
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
has
justice
stevens
who
is
joined
by
justices
brennan
and
marshall.
