mr.
jack
donatelli
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
your
honors,
the
state
of
illinois
does
agree
that
this
case
is
about
what
effectuates
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
and
on
this
issue
we
maintain
that
the
miranda
warnings
must
be
given
their
common
sense
meaning,
that
if
they
are
given
this
meaning,
that
the
four
miranda
warnings
which
apprise
a
suspect
of
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
also
by
their
content
necessarily
apprise
him
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
and
form
the
basis
on
which
he
can
make
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver.
the--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--if
counsel
is
merely
appointed
by
a
court,
justice,
and
the
defendant
doesn't
know
about
it,
i
think
that
plays
no
role
in
his...
in
the
waiver.
mr.
jack
donatelli
i
think
it
would
be
adequate
in
this
regard.
it
certainly
doesn't
affect
the
defendant's
comprehension
of
his
rights
and
his
election
whether
to
go
with
counsel
or
forego
it.
so--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--there--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--that's
right.
in
terms
of
the
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
of
them,
i
would
agree
with
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
donatelli
if
a
defendant
knew
he
had
a
lawyer?
mr.
jack
donatelli
once
the
defendant
knows
he
has
a
lawyer,
and
thereby
somehow
evinces
a
request
for
a
lawyer,
then
i
think
the
edwards
rule
or
the
michigan
versus
jackson
rule
would
kick
in
whereby
the
police
could
no
longer
initiate
any
kind
of
interrogation
or
anything
like
that,
but
just
having
counsel
appointed
by
a
court,
and
that
knowledge
is
not
known
by
the
defendant,
and
he
has
made
no
assertion
that
he
might
want
counsel
on
his
own,
i
think
that
has
no
bearing
on
the
validity
of
his
waiver.
mr.
jack
donatelli
could
they
delay
the
arraignment?
i
am
not
sure--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--i
don't
see
any
problem
with
that,
your
honor,
so
long
as
before
the
arraignment
they
give
him
his
miranda
warnings,
advise
him,
and
he
makes
a
knowing
and
intelligent
choice.
mr.
jack
donatelli
well,
i
know
in
illinois
the
arraignment
has
to
take
place
within
seven
days,
and
a
further
edwards
response
to
your
questioning
of
mr.
honchell,
this
record
is
lacking
on
exactly
what...
the
arraignment
procedure.
it
does
appear
that
there
was
no
arraignment
up
until
this
time,
and
i
can't
tell
from
the
record
exactly
when
arraignment
did
eventually
occur.
mr.
jack
donatelli
in
order
to...
the
incentive
being
that
they
want
to
talk
to
the
defendant
before
he
ever
talks
to
counsel
or--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--counsel
at
arraignment?
that
could
very
well
be,
your
honor.
i
will
concede
that.
i
don't
think
that's
any
problem,
because
no
matter
whether
there
is
that
incentive,
whether
they
delay
it
or
not,
you
are
still
only
going
to
have
a
wavier
based
on
a
full
comprehension
of
the
right.
mr.
jack
donatelli
i
think
that
is
the
kind
of
information
that
is
sometimes
described
as,
it
might
be
helpful,
it
might
not
be
helpful
to
the
defendant,
but
that
is
not
the
question--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--that's
true,
too,
but
again,
that
is
only
knowledge
that
might
be
helpful
to
the
police
action
or
the
defendant's
decision.
the
question
before
this
court,
though,
is
what
is
the
knowledge
that
is
necessary
to
fully
comprehend
the
right,
and
i
maintain
today
that
that
knowledge
is
not
necessary
to
the
waiver
of
the
right.
mr.
jack
donatelli
that
is
my
position.
mr.
jack
donatelli
i
agree
with
that
exactly,
and
that
is
certainly
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
when
i
said
that
knowledge.
unless
there
is
some
affirmative
response
from
the
defendant
saying
i
want
an
attorney,
the
fact
that
a
court
on
its
own
appoints
an
attorney
for
him
is
meaningless
to
the
waiver
of
the
right.
mr.
jack
donatelli
that
would
not
happen,
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
in
cook
county,
the
offer
of
counsel
is
made
at
arraignment,
and
i
have
never
heard
of
any
procedure
in
illinois
or
anywhere
actually
where
counsel
is
appointed
for
a
defendant
outside
his
presence
and
without
his
knowledge.
so
the
state
of
illinois'
position
is
that
from
listening
to
the
miranda
warnings,
those
four
warnings
together
with
the
setting
within
which
they
are
given,
these
things
convey
to
the
defendant
what
he
needs
to
know
about
his
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel,
including
that
this
right
could
be
an
advantage
to
him
and
that
if
he
foregoes
his
rights
it
could
be
of
a
disadvantage
to
him.
it
is
clear
from
the
common
sense
meaning
of
the
miranda
warnings
that
by
telling
him
he
has
a
right
to
counsel,
that
means
he
can
consult
with
counsel,
he
can
have
counsel
present
with
him
at
the
time,
and
that
he
can
avail
himself
of
counsel's
good
professional
judgment.
mr.
jack
donatelli
how
often
does--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
that--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--at
the
time
of
pre-indictment?
mr.
jack
donatelli
that
is
probably
true,
and
either...
i
think
it
might
be
held
in
a
spot
where
there
might
be
a
pd
around
who
could
approach
the
defendant
and
ask
him--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--a
public
defender.
mr.
jack
donatelli
that
i
don't
know.
mr.
jack
donatelli
if
it
is
in
a
setting
where
there
might
be
one
around,
that
could
happen,
but
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
usually
it
would
be
that
the...
just
questioning
would
cease
until
he
gets
an
attorney.
now,
along
with
hearing
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel,
of
course,
the
defendant
also
hears
that
he
has
a
right
to
silence,
and
i
think
the
fact
that
these
warnings
are
given
together
suggest
to
him
that
these
rights
are
very
intertwined
at
the
time
of
custodial
interrogation,
in
other
words,
that
counsel...
he
has
to
make
a
decision
about
counsel
before
he
does
another
thing.
he
also
has
to
make
a
decision
about
remaining
silent,
and
that
counsel's
importance
to
him
at
that
time
has
to
do
with
his
right
to
silence,
and
indeed--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--once
counsel
is
appointed
at
arraignment,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
any
mechanism
whereby
the
police
are
told
that
they
can
no
longer
interrogate
him
now
at
their
own
initiation,
but
of
course
michigan
versus
jackson
from
this
court
would
tell
them
that,
would
tell
the
police
that.
mr.
jack
donatelli
i
think
under
the...
the
rule
set
out
in
edwards
and
michigan
versus
jackson
is
that
no,
the
police
cannot
initiate
an
interrogation--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--once
he
has
evinced
a
desire
to
proceed
with
counsel
at
all
encounters
with
the
police.
the
police...
only
thing
the
police--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--that
is
exactly
right.
and
i
would
like
to
address--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--i
think
so,
certainly,
your
honor,
if
that
is
enough
to
tell
a
defendant
about
his
right
in
one
setting--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--i
think
if
that...
yes,
because
that
gives
him
the
basis
on
which
he
can
fully
comprehend
and
know
and
intelligently
waive
his
right.
mr.
jack
donatelli
i
think
practically
speaking
you
are
right,
it
would
involve
more
than
that,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
way
the
judge
would
inform
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
assistance
of
counsel
and
asking
him
if
he
wants
counsel
appointed,
i
don't
think
he
would
read
the
miranda
warnings
from
him,
but
i
am
saying
their
content...
in
other
words,
the
judge,
i
think,
would
give
him
the
equivalent
content,
but
not
by
reading
those
warnings
off
the
card.
it
wouldn't
be
in
the
nature
of
a
warning,
i
would
assume.
mr.
jack
donatelli
at
arraignment?
i
see
the
distinction
there.
you
are
right.
at
arraignment
that
would
be
a
faretta
type
waiver,
you
are
right,
so
the
miranda
warnings
wouldn't
work.
mr.
jack
donatelli
that
clarification
is
very
important.
you
are
right.
the
miranda
warnings
are
what
conveys
the
knowledge
and
comprehension
of
the
right
at
the
custodial
interrogation.
mr.
jack
donatelli
i
don't
think
that
is
any
problem,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is,
is
that
our
criminal
justice
system
has
a
goal
of
having
the
most
accurate
and
reliable
convictions.
i
think
confessions
from
a
defendant
are
the
best
evidence
and
best
assurance
that
the
judgment
of
guilty
is
indeed
accurate
and
truthful.
mr.
jack
donatelli
yes.
mr.
jack
donatelli
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
jack
donatelli
so
long
as
there
has
been
no
request
for
counsel,
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
jack
donatelli
that
is
exactly
true.
there
are
many
stages,
you
are
right,
your
honor,
where
a
delay
could
be
made,
whether
it
is
arraignment
or
indictment,
in
order
to
be
able
to
talk
with
a
defendant--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--before
he
has
accepted
counsel
or
requested
counsel.
there
is
no
problem
with
that,
i
think,
so
long
as
no
request
is
made--
mr.
jack
donatelli
--well,
certainly
there
is
that.
mr.
jack
donatelli
that
is
exactly
right,
of
course.
mr.
jack
donatelli
in
illinois.
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor.
but...
so
i
think
not
only
do
the
miranda
warnings
convey
everything
he
needs
to
know
at
custodial
interrogation
in
order
to
effectuate
a
valid
waiver,
but
i
think
what
petitioner's
position
misses
is
that
miranda,
while
it
serves
the
fifth
amendment,
it
also
impacts
on
the
sixth
amendment
concerns,
and
i
think
the
miranda
opinion
itself
recognized
that.
in
the
opinion
written
by
chief
justice
earl
warren,
this
court
explained
that
these
warnings
are
good
not
just
for
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
but
they
come
with
residual
benefits,
and
it
talked
about
some
of
those
residual
benefits.
so
the
miranda
opinion
itself
is
replete
with
such
references
to
sixth
amendment
concerns
as
counsel's
presence
in
helping
to
maintain
a
fair
balance
between
the
state
and
the
individual
and
making
available
the
advice
and
good
professional
judgment
of
counsel,
and
referring
to
the
custodial
interrogation
as
an
adversarial
encounter,
so
i
think
petitioner's
position
sells
miranda
short
by
saying
it
merely
protects
fifth
amendment
concerns.
that
may
be
the
purpose
of
the
warning,
but
even
in
miranda
this
court
noted
that
the
impact
was
greater
than
that.
i
would
also
like
to
address
what
mr.
honchell
does
think
is
the
issue
today,
and
that
is
that
no
interrogation
could
take
place
just
by
the
filing
of
the
indictment.
i
think
that
would
not
be
a
good
result.
it
serves
a
function,
as
i
explained
a
little
bit
earlier,
in
the
situation
where
there
is
a
request
for
counsel.
then
it
is
a
good
rule,
because
now
we
know
that
the
defendant
has
asked
to
proceed
in
all
encounters
with
the
police
only
with
the
help
of
counsel.
but
as
i
said,
our
system
of
justice,
criminal
justice
has
a
great
interest
in
securing
confessions
because
they
make...
they
are
the
best
evidence
of
a
reliable
guilty
verdict,
so
that
police
should
be
able
to
approach
a
defendant
and
talk
to
him
about
the
case
with
the
intention
of
using
his
own
words
against
him
in
this
case
even
after
indictment.
i
think
it
helps
the
criminal
justice
system
because
it
means
the
prosecution
can
come
forward
not
only
with
an
adequate
case
or
with
a
good
case
but
with
the
best
case
it
has.
so
that
rule
goes
way
too
far
and
exacts
a
cost
from
the
criminal
justice
system,
i
think,
that
is
unwarranted.
one
last
point
i
would
like
to
bring
up,
i
would
just
like
to
address,
in
our
brief
we
raised
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance.
our
position
is
that
the
statements
were
volunteered,
so
that
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
right...
no
sixth
amendment
waiver
issue
here
at
all.
what
i
would
like
to
say
about
it
is,
the
response
to
mr.
honchell's
argument
in
the
reply
brief
that
that
issue
is
waived,
in
support
of
his
argument,
he
points
out
that
that
issue
is
not
contained
in
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
court
or
the
illinois
supreme
court.
well,
as
far
as
that
goes,
he
is
correct,
but
i
still
think
it
is
disingenuous
for
him
to
raise
the
issue,
since
the
state's
brief
raised
this
argument
on
direct
appeal,
and
mr.
honchell
was
counsel
for
defendant
on
direct
appeal,
and
he
responded
to
that
argument
in
his
reply
brief
on
page
2,
and
on
pages
6
through
7
he
argued
his
response
and
that
the
appellate
court
just
didn't
address
the
issue
because
they
affirmed
on
other
grounds.
we
again
re-raised
that
issue
in
the
illinois
supreme
court.
again
it
was
not
resolved
because
the
issue
was
affirmed...
the
case
was
affirmed
on
other
grounds.
so
we
have
preserved
that
issue.
therefore,
your
honors,
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
