justice
white
do
you
think
that
your
questions
presented
include
or
subsume
an
issue
about
what
the
arbitrator
found
with
respect
to
whether
the
employee
was
actually
smoking
marijuana?
justice
white
well,
the
arbitrator
found,
in
effect,
there
wasn't
cause
they
hadn't
proved
that
he
was
smoking
marijuana.
justice
white
that's
right.
but
that
wasn't
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
in
this
case.
justice
white
and
the
only
issue
you've
brought
here
is
the
public
policy
issue.
justice
white
i
know,
and
that's
the
only
issue
you
bring
here.
justice
white
are
we
free
to
dispose
of
the
case
and
say,
well,
the
court
of
appeals
really
ignored
what
the
arbitrator
found?
justice
white
you
think
so
what?
justice
white
well,
you
didn't
ask
us
to.
justice
white
not
in
the
questions
presented.
justice
white
of
course,
i
can't
find
the
questions
presented
in
your
brief.
you
should
have
had
them
there,
but
they
are
not.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
but
you
are
still
just
talking
about
public
policy.
you
would
never
get
to
that
issue
if
you
said,
the
arbitrator
found
that
he
was
never
smoking
marijuana.
that
at
least
there
wasn't
any
proof
of
it,
or
that
he
even
brought
it
on
the
property.
that's
the
end
of
it.
there
isn't
any
cause.
justice
white
that
may
be
so,
but
the
arbitrator
didn't
find
it.
justice
white
no,
but
he
didn't
find
that
there
was
cause
to
discharge.
he
found
there
wasn't
any.
justice
white
well,
but
i
don't
think
you
brought
that
issue
here.
justice
white
didn't
the
arbitrator
say
that
there
had
been
a
failure
of
proof
that
this
employee
was
smoking
marijuana?
justice
white
well,
were
the
courts
free
to
disregard
that?
justice
white
were
they
or
not?
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
arbitrator
didn't
think
that
was...
since
the
employer
didn't
know
that,
he
construed
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
in
effect,
as
not
saying
that
this
wasn't
cause
for
discharge.
justice
white
was
the
court
really
free
to
overturn
that
construction?
justice
white
as
a
remedy--
justice
white
--but
the
same
limits
don't
apply
to
an
arbitrator's
judgment
about
what
a
remedy
should
be,
as
he
isn't
entitled
to
the
same
deference
that
he
is
when
he
construes
the
contract.
justice
white
on
remedy
as
well
as--
justice
white
--well,
they
didn't
give
any
deference
here.
justice
white
well,
he
did:
he
said
reinstate.
justice
white
i
know
it.
he
credited
the
notion
that
this
marijuana
was
found
in
the
car.
justice
white
and
he
ordered
reinstatement.
justice
white
and
rejected
your
argument.
justice
white
well,
he
rejected
it.
you
made
it.
justice
white
no,
but,
marijuana
was
found
in
the
back
seat
of
his
car.
a
lighted
cigarette
was
found
in
another
employees
car.
justice
white
and
he
was
sitting
in
the
back
seat
of
that
car.
justice
white
i
understand
what
the
equipment
is.
the
company
fired
him
because
they
thought
there
was
ample
proof
that
he
had
been
smoking
marijuana
in
that
car.
justice
white
and
that's
what
the
arbitrator
rejected.
justice
white
he
normally--
justice
white
it's
like
his
ordering
a
drug
addict
back
on
the
job.
justice
white
and
you
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
justified
in
relying
on
the
evidence
of
marijuana
in
the
back
seat
of
his
car
to
conclude
that
he
was
a
drug
user
who
should
not
be
ordered
back
on
the
job.
justice
white
that
just
means
that
the
court
of
appeals
disagrees
with
the
arbitrator
as
a
fact
finder,
on
the
facts.
justice
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
overturn
this
because
they
concluded
that
he
was
a
drug
user?
justice
white
well,
you
suspect
it.
did
they
say
that?
justice
white
do
you
think
that
their
finding
to
that
effect
is
open
here
under
the
questions
that
were
presented
by
the
petitioner?
or
do
we
just
address
the
public
policy
issue?
is
that
all?
justice
white
and
you
don't
put
the
employer
in
jail,
you
put
him
in
jail.
justice
white
but
ordering
the
employer
to
reinstate
him,
arguably...
if
you
order
an
employer
to
put
back
to
work,
in
an
industry
like
this,
a
drug
user,
aren't
you
violating
a
federal
statute
about
a
safe
workplace?
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
that's
the
employer
doing
that,
so
you
are
ordering
the
employer
to
do
something
to
public
policy.
justice
white
but
the
question
is,
is
that
what
this
order
was?
justice
white
is
that
what
this
order
was,
though,
to
put
back
to
work
a
drug
user?
justice
white
but
the
court
of
appeals
obviously,
you
say,
concluded
that
he
was
a
drug
user,
and
that's
why
they
said
it
was
contrary
to
public
policy.
justice
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that,
based
on
that
evidence,
the
remedy
was
inappropriate--
justice
white
--because
it
was
contrary
to
public
policy
to
order
back
to
work
anybody
whose
car
contains
traces
of
marijuana.
justice
white
the
arbitrator
could
have
interpreted
the
word
cause
in
this
case
as
including
finding
marijuana
in
somebody's
car
on
the
premises.
justice
white
but
he
could
have
without
any
rule
or
anything
else.
justice
white
it
may
be
for
back
pay,
but
he
also
said
it
was
all
over
for
reinstatement.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
agreed
with
the
district
court
at
an
arbitration
award
under
collective
bargaining
contract
should
be
set
aside
because
it
was
contrary
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
considered
to
be
public
policy.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
unanimously
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
exceeded
its
authority
in
entering
its
judgment,
and
hence,
its
judgment
must
be
reversed.
justice
blackmun
has
file
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan
has
joined.
