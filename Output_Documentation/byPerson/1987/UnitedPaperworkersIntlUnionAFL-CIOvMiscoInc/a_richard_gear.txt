mr.
a.
richard
gear
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
just
a
small
point,
but
the
evidence
of
the
extra
marijuana
found
in
the
car
was
not
offered
as
a
separate
basis
for
discharge,
that
was
there
and
it
was
offered
to
corroborate
the
fact
that
the
grievance
was
smoking
marijuana,
because
our
view
of
the
evidence
was
that
he
went
to
own
car
with
the
other
two
guys,
they
rolled
a
marijuana
cigarette
from
the
stash
that
he
had
in
his
car--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--he
did
find
that,
sir,
but
he
also--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--but,
the--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--the
court
is
not
free
to
disregard
that,
but
the
fifth
circuit
found,
and
the
arbitrator
did
find
that
the
officers
found
this
extra
quantity
of
marijuana
in
the
grievant's
car.
and
the
basis--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--that's
what
the
arbitrator
did,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
well
the
problem
was,
that
we
argued
in
our
brief
to
the
arbitrator,
that
reinstatement
was
inappropriate
because
of
this
after
discovered
marijuana.
we
did
not
offer
this
after
discovered
marijuana
as
a
separate
basis
for
discharge.
we
offered
it
as
a
basis
for
the
refusal
to
reinstate
this
man.
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--as
a
remedy
problem.
the
arbitrator
did
find
that
the
officers
in
question
found
this
marijuana
in
the
car
and
that
it
was
examined
by
the
laboratory
in
monroe,
louisiana,
and
it
was
found
to
be
marijuana.
he
made
a
finding
as
to
that.
he
credited
the
officers.
now
despite
this
finding,
he
ignored
our
request
to
impose
no
reinstatement
because
of
this
after
discovered
marijuana
as
a
basis
of
public
policy.
he
ignored
our
request,
didn't
make
a
finding
in
his
decision
about
it.
and
in
those
circumstances,
i
think
that...
regardless
of
abstract
theories
about
what
the
courts
can
do
with
arbitrated
decisions...
the
fifth
circuit
can
go
in
and
say,
mr.
arbitrator,
you
ignored
this
issue
that
was
presented
by
the
company,
and
you
have
ignored
this
after
discovered
evidence,
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
we're
going
to
exercise
our
discretion
to
implement
the
public
policy
exception.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
no,
i
think
the
courts
would
give
the
arbitrator
the
same
deference
they
would
normally
give
him,
but
then
you've
got--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--on
remedy,
and
i
think
that
enterprise
wheel--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--but
he
didn't
make
a
finding
as
to
our
remedy.
he
ignored
our
argument--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--but
he
didn't
address
the
question
in
his
decision.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
you
can
view
it
that
way--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--but
he
didn't
even
address
our
argument.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
understand
what
you
are
saying.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
that
has
happened
in
some
cases;
i
have
seen
cases
do
that.
i
think
that
in
this
case
it
was
such
a
blatant...
reinstatement
of
this
individual...
violation
of
public
policy,
and
the
arbitrator
had
ignored
the
after
discovered
evidence,
that
they
went
ahead
and
decided
the
issue.
we
do
not
suggest
and
no
party
suggested
at
the
hearing
that
the
matter
be
remanded
to
the
arbitrator,
i
should
mention.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
no,
i
wouldn't.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
absolutely.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
yes.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
it
doesn't
require
it,
but
the
rule
prohibited
possession
of
marijuana
in
addition
to
smoking
marijuana,
so
the
fact
that
it
was
in
his
car
indicated
that
possession--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
would
agree.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
because
the
after
discovered
evidence
established
very
clearly
that
he
was
in
violation
of
the
plant
rule
prohibiting
possession
of
marijuana
on
the
premises,
and
that
he
operated
the
paper
mill
device
called
a
slitter-rewinder
that
has
large
circular
blades
about
the
size
of
cymbals
that
are
razor
sharp.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
he
wouldn't
automatically
sustain
one,
no.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
think
he
would,
but
in
this
case,
again,
we
are
dealing
in
an
industry
that,
in
louisiana,
has
the
highest
workman's
compensation
rating
in
terms
of
premium
cost
in
the
whole
state.
it
is
the
highest
industry;
it
has
more
accidents.
the
very
machine
that
the
grievant
operated
had
had
ten
or
fifteen
accidents
in
the
four
years
preceding
this
case,
and
the
grievant
had,
in
the
past
six
months
before
his
discharge,
been
put
on
probation
twice
because
of
judgmental
errors
that
were
not
atypical
of
a
marijuana
smoker.
and
further,
the
employer
had
noticed
that
it
had
a
drug
problem.
they
found
marijuana
cigarette
butts
around
the
plant.
they
tried
to
find
the
individuals
involved
but
couldn't.
the
production
supervisor
even
lived
in
a
trailer
on
the
premises
to
try
to
make
surprise
visits
to
the
plant
during
the
night
shift
where
the
problem
was
and
where
the
grievant
worked,
and
he
couldn't
find
the
problem.
so
the
company
had
meetings
with
employees
trying
to
convince
the
employees
that
safety
and
drugs
were
a
matter
of
great
concern
to
the
company
and
their
health
and
safety.
the
arbitrator's
decision
to
reinstate
this
individual,
to
us,
in
the
face
of
these
compelling
considerations
at
the
plant
in
question
is
against
public
policy.
there
are
several
public
policy
grounds
that
the
courts
can
rely
upon
to
utilize
the
public
policy
exception
in
the
field
of
drug
abuse
and
safety
in
the
work
place.
the
country
is
really
in
a
crusade
against
drugs
at
present.
president
reagan
has,
in
his
speech
and
executive
order,
12456,
inaugurated
a
campaign
against
drug
use
and
a
prohibition
of
drug
use
in
the
federal
government.
he
has
claimed
that
illegal
drug
users
are
not
suitable
to
be
federal
employees,
and
that
safety
and
health
in
the
federal
workplace
is
a
concern
of
the
government.
this
is
a
policy
that
is
exemplified
by
the
executive
order.
the
studies
of
the
effect
of
drugs
in
the
american
workplace
have
shown
that
probably
an
estimate
of
$26
billion
a
year
is
lost,
in
lost
productivity
and
health
care
costs,
because
of
drugs
in
the
workplace.
sixteen
billion
of
that
is
lost
productivity.
drug
abusers
in
the
workplace
are
twice
as
likely
to
be
injured,
and
are
one
third
as
likely
to
be
absent
as
straight,
non-drug
users
in
the
workplace.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
don't
think
that
you
can
say
that
an
employer's
failure
to
adopt
a
rule
is
a
violation
of
public
policy,
no.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
in
fact,
the
contract
did
such
have
a
rule,
but
an
employer
can
fire
an
employee
for
drug
usage
without
having
a
specific
rule
in
question.
i
think
a
lot
of
arbitrators
have
upheld
discharges
where
there
was
not
a
rule,
where
drug
use
was
involved.
so
that
the
existence
of
the
rule
isn't
critical.
it
helps
the
case,
certainly,
but
it's
not
going
to
necessarily
determine
the
case
from
the
arbitrator's
point
of
view.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
no,
i'm
not
saying--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--in
this
case,
it
was
clear
the
individual
was
in
possession
of
drugs
on
company
premises.
we
have
a
safety
rule,
a
rule
that
prohibits
possession
of
drugs
on
the
premises.
we
have
an
extremely
hazardous
piece
of
equipment,
the
worst
piece
of
equipment
in
the
plant
for
injury.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
well,
it's
just
that
the
clear
evidence
of
drug
usage
by
this
individual
in
a
safety
problem
industry,
and
his
reinstatement,
is
against
the
public
policy
is
what
we
believe--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--absolutely.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
exactly
right.
now
he
could
have
provided
merely
for
back
pay,
and
we
could
have
lived
with
that,
but
we
can't
live
with
him
back
on
the
job
operating--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--absolutely.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
it
means
they
disagreed
with
his
remedy
deriving
from
the
facts
that
he
found.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
if...
i
have
not
thought
about
it
much
outside
the
drug
concept.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i'm
not
saying
that.
i
would
think
that
there
might
be
a
sever
public
policy
against
the
reinstatement
of
a
violent
individual
to
the
american
workplace.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
think
the
courts
are
going
to
have
to
do
that,
which
is
why
we
are
here.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
there
was
enough
marijuana.
i
saw
the
sample.
it
was
about--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--i
know,
but
the--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--with
marijuana
residue
and
certainly
marijuana
residue
can
be
smoked.
there
was
sufficient
marijuana--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--it
was
not
just
a
trace,
i
assure
you.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
particularly
with
the
background
of
the
drug
problems
at
this
plant,
i--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--the
fifth
circuit
commented
that
de
minimus
is
sufficient
to
violate
the
rule
against
possession
of
marijuana,
particularly
in
a
state
where
you
have
criminal
laws
prohibiting
the
possession
of
marijuana.
that
would
be
sufficient
to
go
to
trial
on.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
would
agree
with
that...
on
the
plant
premises.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
if
the
contract
said
that,
i
would
have
difficulty--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--i
understand
what
you
are
saying,
but
the
public
policy
is,
regardless
of
the
small
residue
in
his
car
that
was
found,
he
is
probably
going
to
do
it
again.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
probably
going
to
be
using
marijuana
on
the
job
again.
you
have
a
drug
user--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--no.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
but
that's
obviously
the
basis
of
the
policy
against
drug
use
in
the
workplace,
the
probability
of
continued
usage.
there
is
no
testimony
that
he
used
it
once
and
never
would
again.
i
might
point
that
out
to
you.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
there
is
testimony
that
he
was
found
with
two
and
a
half
ounces
at
his
home.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
no.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
would
suspect
so.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
they
concluded
that
the
possession
of
this
small
amount
in
violation
of
the
company's
rules
in
a
safety
intense
industry
was
sufficient
basis
to
set
it
aside
using
the
public
policy
exception
of
w.
r.
grace.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
well,
if
the
petitioner
didn't
address
it
and
put
it
before
the
court,
i
don't
think
it's
open.
we
have
both
discussed
it
somewhat
in
our
briefs.
i
have
it
as
a
backstop
argument
that
the
arbitrator
did
exceed
the
bounds
of
the
contract
and
that
his
award
was
irrational,
in
the
event
that
you
were
to
rule
against
us
on
the
public
policy
question.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
argued
it
in
my
brief
that--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--yes.
and
he
didn't
rule
on
that
argument.
that's
what
concerns
me
and
why
we
are
here
today,
also.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
in
that
industry,
the
safety
industry,
the
rule
against
possession
prohibited
also
the
possession
of
whisky
or
alcoholic
beverages
on
the
premises,
and
that
would
have
been
sufficient.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
yes.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i'm
not
sure
about
near
beer.
it
is
our
position
that
the
public
policy
exception
of
w.
r.
grace
will
have
very
little
meaning
if
an
award
is
limited
to
the
violation
of
a
positive
law.
the
language
of
w.
r.
grace...
written
by
justice
blackmun,
i
believe...
indicates
that
the
courts,
in
defining
public
policy,
can
refer
to
the
laws
and
the
legal
precedence.
this
to
me
means
more
than
merely
a
violation
of
positive
law
that
is
involved.
w.
r.
grace
spoke
of
other
factors
and
looked
at
other
matters
of
policy
when
they
made
their
decision
in
w.
r.
grace.
the
court
was
correct
earlier
in
that
traditionally,
in
the
review
of
contracts
outside
of
the
labor
field
for
violations
of
public
policy,
that
the
courts
have
not
merely
set
aside
those
contracts
when
a
positive
law
has
been
involved.
the
courts
have
looked
to
general
considerations
of
public
policy.
the
crocker
case,
the
muschany
case,
the
sprott
case,
even,
involving
the
confederate
cotton,
was
not
decided
on
the
basis
of
a
specific
law
that
held
that
the
individual
that
tried
to
get
the
money
for
his
cotton
was
in
fact
violating
a
positive
law.
to
me,
we
really
don't
need
a
positive
law
to
infer
a
public
policy
against
drug
use
in
the
workplace,
and
particularly
in
the
hazardous
industries.
the
hazardous
industry
in
this
case
is
not
so
publicly
involved
as
the
hazardous
industries
in
the
airline,
railway,
the
common
carrier
industry.
in
an
amicus
curiae
brief--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--there
is
a
positive
law--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--louisiana
statutes
prohibit
the
possession
of
marijuana.
it's
a
six
months
fine
for
first
offense
and
up
to
20
years
for
the
third
offense.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
then
you've
violated
a
positive
law.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
of
course
not,
but--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--that's
correct,
but
we're
not
going
to
find
a
law
in
this
country,
to
my
knowledge,
that
says
the
possession
of
marijuana
shall
bar
one
from
employment.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
you
are
violating
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--the
employer's
duty
to--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--you
are
ordering
the
employer
to
violate
the
federal
obligation
to
provide
a
safe
workplace,
and
a
louisiana
statute
also
exists
imposing
a
duty
to
provide
a
safe
workplace
on
the
employer.
that's
23:
13
of
the
louisiana
revised
statute.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
sir?
mr.
a.
richard
gear
it
was
to
put
back
to
work
an
individual
that
was
found
in
the
back
seat
of
a
car
where
an
amount
of
marijuana
smoke
existed,
that
had
marijuana
found
on
the
premises
of
the
employer's
plant
in
violation
of
the
company's
rule,
and
i
think
it
would
put
back
to
work
a
drug
possessor
or
probably
drug
user.
i
just
don't
think
an
employer
and
the
public
can
risk
that
in
a
safety
intensive
industry.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
for
the
arbitrator
to
refuse
to
be
persuaded?
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
they
concluded
that
he
was
a
drug
possessor.
i
believe
that's
clear.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
no,
i
don't
think
so,
but
there
are
cases
that
hold,
in
the
area
particularly,
that
constructive
possession
can
be
based
upon
similar
facts
to
that.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
don't
think
so.
not
in
the
louisiana
criminal
decisions.
i
don't
think
so,
because
they
have
held
constructive
possession
when
an
individual
has
been
seen
in
the
company
of
folks
smoking
marijuana
and
with
marijuana
on
the
ground
near
him.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
would
agree.
the
finder
of
fact
in
our
case,
though,
did
find
that
the
individual
possessed
marijuana
in
his
car,
based
upon
the
police
search,
though.
so
we
have
a
finding
of
fact
we
can
rely
on
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
of
course,
s.
d.
warren's
court
in
the
first
circuit
held,
also
in
a
paper
mill,
also
in
very
similar
problems
of
marijuana
usage
that
the
public
policy
was
not
served
by
the
arbitrator's
reinstatement
of
drug
users
in
that
situation,
on
essential
identical
grounds
to
the
misco
case.
the
fifth
circuit
held
the
same
thing
in
the
context
of
the
drinking
truck
driver
in
the
over
the
road
trucking
industry.
so
i
think
the
courts
are
moving
towards
this.
the
unions
arguments
that
the
floodgates
will
open
in
the
event
that
the
courts
find
a
flexible
public
policy
exception,
i
think
that
argument
is
not
appropriate.
we
have
rule
11
sanctions
if
employers
seek
to
set
aside
arbitration
awards
without
sufficient
basis.
i
think
that
is
a
good
stop.
i
think
that
the
courts
exercise
judicial
restraint
in
utilizing
the
public
policy
exception
and
overlooking
arbitration
decisions.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
the
unions
and
employers
already
are
able
to
appeal
to
the
courts
arbitration
decision
which
exceed
the
bounds
of
the
arbitrator's
power
in
the
contract.
this
is
nothing
new.
i
don't
think
that
a
flexible
public
policy
exception
will
deter
or
interfere
with
the
national
labor
relations
policy
to
any
extent.
really,
i
think
what
we
are
looking
at
today
is,
we
can
have
a
narrow
positive
law
exception
as
urged
by
the
petitioner
which
doesn't
protect,
say,
the
public
with
the
reinstatement
of
a
dope
user
to
operate
the
control
room
of
a
nuclear
power
plant,
or
puts
him
the
control
room
of
a
refinery
or
some
other
hazardous
industry,
or
we
can
be
reasonable
and
use
a
common
sense
approach
and
determine
that
public
policy
is
more
flexible
in
the
area
of
drugs
and
alcohol
abuse.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
they
can
bargain
for
a
provision,
or
they
can
just
implement
work
rules
if
they
have
the
authority
under
the
contract
to
do
so,
that
says
that
the
discharge
of
an
individual
for
possession
of
marijuana
is
a
dischargeable--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
--well,
he
could
have,
but
he
didn't
accept
that
evidence.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
he
had
the
view
that
the
employer
has
to
know
exactly
every
piece
of
evidence
in
support
of
the
discharge
at
the
moment
of
the
discharge,
and
would
not
receive
the
corroborating
evidence
which
we
found
just
a
week
before
the
arbitration
hearing
by
going
through
the
police
records
that
this
fellow
had
in
fact
some
marijuana
in
his
car.
the
arbitrator
said
that
if
you
don't
know
it
at
the
time
of
discharge,
it's
all
over.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
well,
he
reinstated
him,
certainly.
i
think
it
all
gets
back
down
to
a
common
sense
view
of
the
national
labor
relations
policy
and
the
public
policy
exception.
we
submit
that
the
courts
view
below
of
the
flexible
public
policy
exception
is
the
correct
view,
and
we
appreciate
the
court's
time.
