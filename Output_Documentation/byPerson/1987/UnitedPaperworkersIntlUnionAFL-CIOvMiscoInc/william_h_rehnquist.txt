mr.
silberman,
you
may
begin
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
say
that
there
isn't
any
public
policy
exception,
you
just
say
it
is
a
good
deal
narrower
than
the
fifth
circuit
thought
it
was?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
fellow
had
been
a
truck
driver
and
was
found
two
or
three
times
to
have
been
driving
while
under
the
influence
of
marijuana?
and
let's
say
that
violates
louisiana
law.
the
arbitrator
says,
take
him
back,
that
is
my
interpretation
of
the
contract.
now
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
in
louisiana
law
that
says
you
are
forbidden
to
re-employ
someone
who
has
been
three
times
convicted
of
driving
under
marijuana
unless
his
license
is
revoked,
and
let's
say
this
fellow's
license
hasn't
been
revoked.
now
do
you
think
a
district
court
must
enforce
that
award?
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
there
really
isn't
any
sort
of
public
policy...
room
for
a
court's
public
policy
determinations
under
301,
in
your
view,
as
there
traditionally
has
been
in
the
law
of
contracts.
because
certainly
the
public
policy
exception
in
the
law
of
contracts
is
much
broader
than
you
say.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
about
a
school
bus
driver
for
a
private
school?
i
mean,
change
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical
to
a
school
bus
driver
for
a
private
school.
would
you
give
301
application
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
that's
what
common
law
courts
did,
was
to
occasionally
substitute
their
judgment
for
the
party's
judgment.
you
say,
in
this
case,
congress
thought
about
all
of
this
and
decided
that
there
should
be
no
public
policy
exception
to
labor
contracts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
evidence
do
you
have
that
congress
thought
about
this?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
that
the
prevailing
opinion
in
the
black
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
silberman.
mr.
gear,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
it
be
more
consistent
with
ordinary
judicial
review
of
arbitration
if
the
fifth
circuit
felt
that
he
had
ignored
a
submission
or
ignored...
to
send
it
back
to
the
arbitrator
rather
than
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
simply
make
the
finding
itself?
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
the
arbitrator
automatically
sustain
a
dismissal
for
violation
of
a
plant
rule
even
if
he
had
considered
and
credited
all
your
evidence?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there's
nothing...
the
arbitrator
doesn't
offend
that
sort
of
law,
because
if
the
guy
is
going
to
use
marijuana,
he
offends
it
as
much
as
if
he
has
been
fired
as
if
he
is
still
working.
the
fact
that
he
is
going
to
use
marijuana,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it
increases
the
violation
of
that
statute
to
say
that
he
may
be
using
marijuana
at
work
if
all
you
are
relying
on
is
a
statute
that
says
it's
illegal
to
use
marijuana
anywhere.
and
one
of
the
penalties
for
violating
that
statute
isn't
to
be
fired,
is
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
supposing
it
were
a
liquor...
supposing
the
evidence
shows
someone
saw
"x"
drinking
liquor
in
a
car,
and
there
was
liquor
spilled
in
the
back
seat,
and
"y"
had
been
sitting
in
the
car,
but
there
is
no
who
actually
saw
"y"
drinking
liquor.
do
you
think
that
a
fact
finder
is
compelled
to
conclude
that
"y"
was
drinking
liquor
just
because
"x"
was
and
there
was
liquor
in
the
car?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
a
bit
of
a
jump
first
from
use,
then
to
possession,
then
to
constructive
possession.
you
get
pretty
far
out.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
is
one
thing
to
uphold
a
conviction
based
upon
a
conclusion
to
that
effect
by
the
finder
of
fact,
but
it
is
another
thing
to
say
the
finder
of
fact
must
draw
that
inference.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gear.
mr.
silberman,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
silberman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-651,
united
paperworkers
international
versus
misco
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
