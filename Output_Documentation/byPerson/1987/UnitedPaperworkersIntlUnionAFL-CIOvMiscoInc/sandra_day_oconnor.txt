justice
o'connor
mr.
silberman,
if
the
finding
had
been
that
indeed
this
employee
had
had
a
marijuana
cigarette
out
in
the
parking
lot
of
the
employer's
premises,
and
had
been
smoking
it,
and
the
arbitrator
had
further
concluded
that
he
should
be
restored
to
his
job,
could
the
public
policy
exception
apply
there
to
justify
saying,
that's
an
improper
remedy?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
there
conceivably
could
be
a
valid
recognizable
public
policy
to
the
effect
that
employees
will
not,
if
they
are
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol,
be
allowed
to
work
with
dangerous
machines?
what
about
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
and
so
forth?
justice
o'connor
so
that
an
employee,
an
airline
pilot,
who
drinks,
should
be
nevertheless
allowed
to
fly
if
the
arbitrator
so
decides?
justice
o'connor
would
you
adhere
to
your
view
even
in
circumstances
when
the
employer
might
be
a
public
employer
charged
with
a
specific
mandate
or
duty
to
provide
a
certain
service?
for
example,
to
provide
transportation
to
young
school
children,
and
therefore
have
to
re-employ
a
school
bus
driver
who
has
been
found
to
have
been
smoking
marijuana.
justice
o'connor
mr.
silberman,
there
are
example
in
case
law
where
courts
have
overturned
decisions
of
arbitrators
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
including
sometimes
gross
misjudgment.
aren't
there
examples
of
that
found
in
the
case
law
around
the
country?
