of
course,
mr.
silberman,
what
bothers
me
is
that
there
is
more
than
just
the
workplace
here:
there
is
the
safety
of
other
people
also.
now
there
have
been
some
hypotheticals
thrown
at
you.
what
if
this
were
a
driver
of
a
greyhound
bus?
smoking
marijuana
is
all
right?
justice
blackmun
and
you
say
the
same
thing
about
a
d.c.
taxicab
driver?
justice
blackmun
and
you'll
be
the
next
fare?
justice
blackmun
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
somebody
more
than
the
parties
involved.
