justice
stevens
mr.
gear,
when
you
say
it
was
a
blatant
violation
of
public
policy,
on
what
facts
do
you
conclude
that
it
was
blatant?
if
you
limit
yourself...
one
way
to
look
at
the
case
is
just
take
the
one
sentence
on
page
58
of
the
arbitrator's
report,
the
only
thing
the
company
has
proven
was
that
the
grievant
was
sitting
in
the
back
seat
of
a
car
in
which
there
was
found
a
lit
marijuana
cigarette
in
the
front
seat
ashtray,
a
front
seat
just
moments
before
vacated
by
another
company
employee.
now
if...
and
i
understand
you
take
a
different...
if
that
were
the
only
fact,
would
you
still
make
the
public
policy
argument?
justice
stevens
so
your
argument
depends
on
the
fact
that
there
was
also
marijuana
found
in
the
back
seat?
justice
stevens
and
does
it
further
require
you
to
draw
the
inference
from
that
that
this
employee
was
smoking
marijuana?
justice
stevens
and
that
nobody
has
found
that?
justice
stevens
so
which
is
the
blatant
public
policy
violation?
the
fact
that
there
was
some
marijuana
in
the
back
seat
of
his
car
or
the...
his
sitting
in
this
car
is
totally
irrelevant
then,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
so
that
the
asserted
basis
for
the
discharge
is
no
longer
relied
on.
justice
stevens
mr.
gear,
i
want
to
be
sure.
the
marijuana
that
was
in
his
car,
as
i
recall,
was
residue
in
the
scale.
wasn't
that
right?
there's
not
anything
indicating
there
was
enough
marijuana
to
be
smoked.
justice
stevens
well,
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
that.
justice
stevens
what
the
court
of
appeals
said...
now
you
want
us
to
go
beyond
what
the
court
of
appeals
found.
the
court
of
appeals
found
there
was
a
scales
case
containing
marijuana
residue.
justice
stevens
we
don't
know
how
much,
and
it
could
have
been
just
a
trace,
couldn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
the
record
that
comes
to
us,
it
could
have
been
just
a
trace,
and
is
that
enough
for
your
position?
if
it
were
just
a
trace,
would
it
nevertheless
follow
that
he
must
be
discharged?
justice
stevens
well--
justice
stevens
--i
understand
that,
but
it
would
be
true
that
even
if
he
went
to
trial,
found
guilty,
and
served
his
sentence
and
all,
the
public
policy
rule
for
which
you
contend
is,
that
if
in
a
dangerous
industry...
and
i
agree
with
you
it's
a
dangerous
industry...
an
employee's
car
is
found
to
have
contained
a
residue
of
marijuana,
he
must
be
fired.
justice
stevens
as
a
matter
of
public
policy.
justice
stevens
and
even
if
the
contract
provided,
we
will
not
fire
people
unless
we
find
more
than
six
ounces
of
marijuana.
if
the
contract
said
that...
like
the
arbitrator
said,
here,
this
isn't
enough...
you'd
say
that
contract
is
against
public
policy
and
they
must
contain
in
the
contract
a
provision
requiring
discharge
on
these
circumstances.
justice
stevens
why?
public
policy
overrides
the
contract.
that's
your
whole
case.
justice
stevens
probably
going
to
do
what
again?
justice
stevens
is
there
any
finding
he
ever
did
use
marijuana
on
the
job?
justice
stevens
how
can
you
say
probably
be
doing
it
again
if
you
don't
have
the
first
violation?
justice
stevens
there
is
not
testimony
he
used
it
once,
is
there?
justice
stevens
but
is
there
testimony
that
he
ever
used
it?
justice
stevens
what
if
they
found
a
case
of
beer
in
the
back
seat
and
a
drunk
passenger
in
the
front
seat?
would
public
policy
require
his
discharge?
justice
stevens
it
would
have
been
a
mandatory
discharge
if
he
had
beer
in
the
car?
justice
stevens
mr.
gear,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
there
is
a
positive
law
prohibiting
drug
use
in
the
work
place.
there
is
a
positive
law
prohibiting
drug
use.
justice
stevens
so
if
you
can
prove
drug
use
in
the
workplace,
you
have
proved
a
violation
not
only
of
public
policy
but
positive
law.
justice
stevens
so
a
fortiori
if
you've
got
it
in
possession
when
you're
working
one
of
these
slitting
machines.
justice
stevens
mr.
gear,
isn't
there
another
protection
that
is
available?
can't
the
employers
get
a
provision
in
the
contract
that
entitles
them
to
discharge
somebody
who
has
ever
been
in
possession
of
marijuana
or
something
like
that?
