mr.
david
silberman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
action
that
was
commenced
by
the
respondent
employer
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947,
in
an
attempt
to
overturn
an
arbitration
award
that
was
rendered
pursuant
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
petitioner
union
and
the
employer.
the
question
that
is
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
the
courts
are
free
in
such
an
action
to
relieve
one
party
to
a
lawful
collective
bargaining
agreement,
as
that
agreement
has
been
interpreted
by
the
arbitrator,
to
relieve
a
party
of
his
obligations
under
the
contract
of
the
theory
that
there
is
some
public
policy
against
enforcing
that
lawful
contract.
the
facts
out
of
which
that
question
arises
can
be
briefly
summarized,
and
in
light
of
the
conclusory
labels
that
have
been
tossed
around
in
the
briefs,
are
of
some
particular
importance
here.
in
february
of
1983,
the
company
discharged
an
employee
by
the
name
of
isiah
cooper.
the
stated
ground
for
the
discharge
was
that
mr.
cooper
had
been
seen
possessing
a
marijuana
cigarette
in
a
car
in
the
company's
parking
lot.
and
the
company
maintained
that
that
established
a
violation
of
a
work
rule
promulgated
against
the
company,
which
rule
prohibits
an
employee
from
bringing
marijuana
onto
company
premises
or
using
marijuana
or
alcohol.
the
union
filed
a
grievance
alleging
that
the
discharge
was
without
just
cause
and
therefore
in
breach
of
contract.
and
that
grievance
was
submitted
to
arbitration
and
the
auspices
of
the
federal
mediation
conciliation
service.
the
arbitrator
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
company
had
failed
to
prove
a
violation
of
the
work
rule
in
the
manner
respected:
the
employee
was
not
guilty
of
either
bringing
that
marijuana
cigarette
onto
company
property
or
smoking
that
cigarette.
the
arbitrator
noted
that
the
company
at
the
hearing
had
attempted
to
defend
the
discharge
on
a
new
ground
by
claiming
that
there
was
evidence
that
tracings
of
marijuana
had
been
found
in
a
plastic
bag
in
the
employee's
car.
but
the
arbitrator
said
that
he
would
not
consider
that
evidence.
he
explained
that
the
just
cause
provision
of
the
contract
was
to
be
interpreted
in
accordance
with
the
ordinary
meaning
of
that
phrase,
"in
industrial
relations",
and
just
cause
prohibits
an
employee
from
introducing
new
grounds
that
were
not
raised
at
the
time
of
the
discharge
or
at
any
time
in
the
grievance
procedure.
so
having
therefore
found
that
the
only
question
that
was
before
him...
the
company
had
failed
to
make
out
its
proof...
the
arbitrator
ordered
the
employee
reinstated
with
back
pay,
and
this
lawsuit
followed.
the
employer
succeeded
in
persuading
the
lower
courts
to
vacate
the
arbitration
award.
now
it
is
important
to
note
that
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
quarreled
with
the
job
that
the
arbitrator
had
done
as
the
interpreter
of
the
contract.
that
is,
they
accepted
the
validity
of
his
conclusion
that
the
employer
here
had
promised
that
it
would
not
discharge
an
employee
unless
it
was
able
to
prove
the
grounds
on
which
the
discharge
was
based.
the
court
also
did
not
question
the
fact
that
the
employer
was
perfectly
free
to
enter
into
that
promise;
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
to
prohibit
it.
and
he
was
free
in
this
instance
to
live
up
to
his
promise;
there
was
nothing
in
the
law
that
makes
it
unlawful
for
him
to
take
this
employee
back.
but
the
courts
nonetheless
concluded
that
it
was
against
public
policy
for
them
to
hold
the
employer
to
his
promise,
and
the
particular
public
policy
they
cited
is
"the
public
policy
against
the
operation
of
dangerous
machinery
by
persons
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol.
"
now
it
is
our
principal
submission
here
that
in
arrogating
to
itself
this
kind
of
power,
to
refuse
to
enforce
a
lawful
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
lower
courts
have
overstepped
the
limits
of
their
authority
under
section
301
of--
mr.
david
silberman
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
say
that
insofar
as
the
court
is
saying,
that
even
though
this
is
a
lawful
agreement,
there
is
a
public
policy
against
enforcing
this
perfectly
lawful
agreement.
we
don't
think
the
court's
authority
goes
that
far,
and
we
think
the
proper
role--
mr.
david
silberman
--your
honor,
we
believe
not.
as
we
understand
the
public
policy
exception,
the
rule
is
the
one
stated
by
judge
easterbrook
in
his
opinion
in
the
e.
i.
dupont
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
it
is
a
rule
that
constrains
the
court
to
enforce
positive
law
and
not
to
introduce
its
own
notions
in
that
way.
and
we
think
that
the
rule
that
judge--
mr.
david
silberman
--certainly
there
could
be
a
public
policy
in
the
sense
that
a
legislature
could
say
that
people
who
have
committed
this
wrong
should
not
be
employed
in
that
category
of
jobs,
and
we
certainly
have
no
quarrel
with
the
notion
that
there
could
be
a
public
policy
in
that
sense.
we
do
believe,
however,
that
if
the
legislature
has
not
gone
that
far
and
has
stated
a
public
policy
at
the
general
level
of,
for
example,
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
that
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
labor
relations
system,
and
it
is
not
appropriate
for
the
courts
to
attempt
to
elaborate
upon
that
policy
by
trying
to
decide
whether
that
policy
would
or
would
not
be
served
or
disserved--
mr.
david
silberman
--fortunately,
that
is
precise
instance
where
there
is
a
federal
aviation
administration
which
decides
are
or
are
not
entitled
to
fly,
if
there
is
an
faa
regulation,
and
there
is
indeed
a
regulation
covering
pilots
who
have
been
using
alcohol.
so
that
if
the
faa
says
that
this
person
should
not
be
flying,
then
clearly
an
arbitrator's
award
that
puts
that
person
back
to
work
would
not
be
entitled
to
enforcement.
but
it
is
precisely
our
point
that
if
the
faa
has
said
that,
yes,
it's
okay
for
this
person
to
fly,
and
the
employer
has
promised
that
he
will
take
this
person
back...
at
least
the
arbitrator
has
told
us
that's
what
his
promise
means...
that
the
court
should
not
put
themselves
in
the
business
of
trying
to...
of
second
guessing
the
faa
and
substituting
their
view
of
what
is
sound
for
the
party's
view
or
the
faa's
view.
mr.
david
silberman
that's
precisely
how
i
understand
judge
easterbrook's
approach,
justice
scalia.
and
we
do
think
that
that
approach
makes
particularly
good
sense,
i
should
add,
in
the
context
of
a
just
cause
discharge
kind
of
case.
because
in
that
kind
of
case,
the
very
question
that
is
being
decided
is,
what
is
the
appropriate
punishment
or
penalty
for
a
particular
individual
who
has
committed
a
particular
kind
of
wrong.
and
there
is
a
variety
of
factors
that
one
might
want
to
take
into
account
in
making
that
judgment,
and
that
is
precisely
what
arbitrators
do.
and
unless--
mr.
david
silberman
--i
think
judge
easterbrook
does
go
precisely
that
far,
and
we
do
think
that
that
is
indeed
the
appropriate
in
the
particular
301
context
in
which
we
find
ourselves
here.
mr.
david
silberman
yes,
we
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
believe
that
if
there
is
nothing
in
louisiana
law
and
the
state
is
perfectly
free,
as
you
suggest,
the
state
does
license
truck
drivers,
and
it's
the
state's
responsibility
to
decide
whether
somebody
should
not
be
on
the
road.
but
if
the
employer
has
the
lawful
discretion
to
employ
this
person,
and
the
employer
has
agreed
by
contract
that
it
will
continue
to
employ
that
person,
we
think
it
is
not
an
appropriate
role
for
the
courts
to
second
guess
and
overturn
the
employer's
promise
in
that
regard.
mr.
david
silberman
i
would
say
two
things
in
response,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
the
first
is,
as
we
understand
the
common
law
notion,
the
common
law
notion
itself
always
assumed
that
whatever
common
law
powers
the
judges
exercise
was
subject
to
the
subordinate
power
of
a
legislature
to
establish
public
policy.
so
that
in
so
far
as
we
are
right
in
suggesting,
if
the
congress
did
that,
when
it
enacted
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
when
it
created
this
system
of
collective
bargaining
and
of
grievance
arbitration,
we
think
our
position
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
principle
of
the
common
law
doctrine,
although
i
certainly
do
concede
that
in
a
particular
case
a
common
law
judge
would
have
exercised
a
broader
authority.
we
also
would
note
that
this
court
has
made
clear
in
other
301
cases
that
ordinary
contract
principles
do
not
fit
very
well
to
this
peculiar
301
context,
and
should
not
be
binding
in
fashioning
the
federal
law
of
labor
contracts.
mr.
david
silberman
section
301
does
not
apply
to
public
employers.
the
policies
on
which
we
are
arguing
are
policies
that
only
apply
in
private
sector
labor
relations.
now
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
really
two
critical
aspects
of
the
national
labor
relations
act--
mr.
david
silberman
--our
answer
does
not
change.
that
is
right.
we
would
say
in
that
case
that
if
the
employer
is
free
to
employ
that
person,
public
authorities
have
not
seen
fit
to
disqualify
that
individual,
and
if
the
arbitrator
has
concluded...
taking
into
account
all
the
circumstances...
that
this
is
not
somebody
that
has
done
such
a
wrong
that
he
should
be
taken
from
his
job
completely
and
totally
and
absolutely,
that
there
is
no
basis
in
principle
for
the
courts
to
second
guess
that
kind
of
judgment.
and
what
the
courts
wind
up
doing
if
they
do
so
is
really
substituting
their
judgment
as
to
what
is
the
sound
way
of
treating
people
for
either
public
laws
judgment
or
the
party's
judgment,
and
that
this
system--
mr.
david
silberman
--we
say
that
the
principle
in--
mr.
david
silberman
--i
think
what
we
say
is
slightly
different
than
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
we
say
is
that
the
policies
that
the
congress
enacted
leave
no
room,
that
it
would
run
at
cross
purposes
with
the
statute,
it
would
fundamentally
undermine
the
statute
if
the
courts
were
to
exercise
that
kind
of
power.
and
it
seems
to
us
there
are
two
interrelated
aspects
of
labor
policy
that
really
bear
on
this
question.
one
is
the
policy
of
favoring
free
collective
bargaining,
of
private
autonomy
and
decision
making.
when
congress
enacted
the
national
labor
relations
act,
it
decided
that
instead
of
creating
a
set
of
substantive
rules
to
regulate
work
places,
that
the
best
way
to
protect
employees
and
to
further
labor
peace,
was
to
encourage
the
parties
to
really
make
their
own
charter
for
industrial
relations.
and
so
congress
imposed
the
duty
to
bargain,
and
it
delimited
the
subjects
of
bargaining.
and
then
it
said
to
the
parties
that
so
long
as
the
agreement
you
make
is
a
lawful
agreement,
you
are
free
to
make
that
agreement
and
our
role
is
to
enforce
the
agreement,
because
we
think
that
that
is
the
way
for
the
most
conducive
set
of
labor
relations.
mr.
david
silberman
i
think
the
difference
is
this,
justice
scalia.
in
the
ordinary
contract
context
there
is
a
principle
of
freedom
of
contract,
but
there
is
not
a
duty
to
bargain,
for
example,
outside
of
the
labor
relations
context.
congress
here
commanded
bargaining
because
it
viewed
contracting...
not
just
it
thought
it
was
good
for
parties
to
do
whatever
they
wanted,
but
it
thought
that
this
system
of
self-government
was
the
best
way
to
further
a
set
of
public
concerns,
and
was
preferable
to
imposing
a
set
of
government
regulations
on
the
work
place.
so
that
we
think
that
the
philosophy
of
the
nlra
goes
quite
beyond
the
philosophy
of
the
law
of
contracts,
and
that
the
most
concrete
manifestation
of
that
is
the
duty
to
bargain,
which
is
unique
to
the
labor
relations
context,
and
which,
of
course,
is
codified
in
section
885.
the
other
aspect
of
labor
relations
policy
is
this
encouragement
of
private
dispute
resolution,
of
arbitration
instead
of
litigation,
and
as
this
court
explained
in
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
that
reflects
congress's
understanding
that
it
is
unrealistic
to
expect
the
parties
at
one
time
to
sit
down
and
develop
a
set
of
rules
that
will
govern
every
situation
that
arises
in
this
ongoing
relationship.
and
congress
said,
that
instead
of
encouraging
you
to
run
to
the
courts
to
resolve
these
matters,
or
moreover,
instead
of
your
resolving
these
matters
through
an
ad
hoc
adjustment
of
economic
forces,
what
we
think
the
best
way
to
deal
with
these
is
for
you
to
get
somebody
who
you
trust,
who
you
the
parties
trust,
and
empower
him
to
elaborate
on
your
contract
and
develop
a
set
of
rules,
and
we
will
do
our
best
to
enforce
that
system
and
uphold
that
system.
mr.
david
silberman
the
question
of
what
the
role
of
the
arbitrator
and
public
law
is
is
a
complex
question.
at
the
threshold,
justice
scalia,
as
national
academy
develops
in
its
brief
amicus
curiae,
in
a
discharge
case
the
issue
that
is
entrusted
to
the
arbitrator,
the
just
cause
issue
necessarily
asks
the
arbitrator
to
take
into
account
the
variety
of
public
policies.
arbitrators
treat
cases
that
involve
employees
who
are
dangerous
very
differently
than
they
treat
an
employee
who
has
thrown
a
spitball
in
the
plant,
and
they
do
so
because
they
have
an
understanding
of
public
policy
and
that
the
party
has
expected
those
kinds
of
considerations.
certainly,
arbitrators
can
do
that,
they
should
do
that,
they
do
do
that.
and
it
would
be
part
of
our
submission,
the
reason
why
in
this
case
we
think
it
is
especially
inappropriate
to
authorize
the
courts
into
this
area,
is
that
there
is
no
principle
by
which
a
judge
can
say
that
in
this
particular
case,
this
individual
has
done
something
so
serious
that
he
shouldn't
be
put
back
to
work.
it
requires
a
very
particularized
judgment.
you
want
to
know
what
he
did,
were
there
any
extenuating
circumstances,
what's
his
past
record,
what
is
his
likelihood
of
repetition:
that's
precisely
the
question
the
arbitrator
asks.
and
the
arbitrator
does
so
because
the
parties
have
empowered
him
to
do
so
because
they
trust
him
to
render
their
judgment
for
them,
if
you
will.
and
if
the
courts
get
involved
in
this
area,
what
the
courts
are
going
to
wind
up
doing
is
simply
redoing
what
the
arbitrator
has
done,
and
substituting
not
some
rule
of
law
they
can
apply
in
any
kind
of
neutral
way,
but
their
best
judgment
for
the
arbitrator's
judgement
and
ultimately,
for
the
parties'
judgment.
and
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
basis
for
taking
from
the
parties
their
right
to
make
their
own
decisions
on,
at
what
point
is
somebody
sufficiently
dangerous
or
sufficiently
harmful
or
sufficiently
evil
that
he
shouldn't
go
back
to
work,
and
substituting
a
court's
resolution
of
that.
a
resolution
which,
as
i
say,
can't
be
animated
by
any
kind
of
principle.
mr.
david
silberman
certainly
since
this
court's
decision
in
enterprise
wheel,
the
courts
have
been
empowered
to
ask,
has
the
arbitrator
gone
about
his
job
of
interpreting
the
contract
or
is
he
substituting
his
own
brand
of
industrial
justice.
there
is
not
doubt
that
there
are
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
found
that
the
arbitrator
was
not
carrying
out
his
mission
and
have
therefore
overturned,
and
we
obviously
don't
quarrel
with
that.
and
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
the
court
of
appeals
here
did
not
suggest
that
the
arbitrator
had
done
that,
and
indeed,
the
arbitrators
award
here
draws
upon
the
general
understanding
of
the
just
cause
concept.
beyond
that,
there
are
very
few
cases,
or
at
least
very
few
cases
prior
to
the
last
couple
of
years,
in
which
a
court
would
overturn
an
arbitrators
award
on
public
policy
grounds,
except
in
a
situation
where
we,
and
we
think
judge
easterbrook,
acknowledge
the
propriety
of
doing
that.
that
is,
where
public
law
says
that
you
can't
enforce
this
award.
where
the
arbitrator
has
ordered
the
employer
to
commit
an
unlawful
act.
mr.
david
silberman
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the
question,
justice
white.
what
we
did,
as
i
recall,
in
our
questions--
mr.
david
silberman
--because
they
hadn't
proved
either
that
he
was
smoking
marijuana
or
that
he
had
brought
marijuana
on
the
plant
premises.
they
hadn't
proved
a
violation
of
the
rule.
mr.
david
silberman
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said--
mr.
david
silberman
--the
court
of
appeals
did
base
its
judgment
precisely
on
the
public
policy
issue.
mr.
david
silberman
correct,
and
we--
mr.
david
silberman
--i
think
so,
justice
white.
as
i
recall--
mr.
david
silberman
--that
you
are
free
to
do
so.
mr.
david
silberman
i
think
we
did.
mr.
david
silberman
i
think
we
did.
my
recollection
of
the
questions
presented
is
that
there--
mr.
david
silberman
--i
was
having
the
same
difficulty.
mr.
david
silberman
fortunately
they
are
in
the
petition
for
cert.,
where
they
also
should
have
been
in
ours.
we
first
posed
the
question
that
i
have
been
arguing
to
you,
as
to
the
principled
limit
of
the
public
policy
exception.
the
second
question
we
raised
was
if
you
disagree
with
us
and
say
that
there
is
this
kind
of
authority,
was
it
appropriately
exercised
in
this
case?
mr.
david
silberman
well,
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
because
of
the
evidence...
the
arbitrator
also
found
that
the
company
had
proffered
evidence
of
these
gleanings
of
marijuana
in
the
grievant's
car.
mr.
david
silberman
the
arbitrator
did
acknowledge
the
existence
of
that
evidence.
mr.
david
silberman
correct.
he
found
that
that's
not
relevant.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
that
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
he
is
not
free
to
do
that.
so
that
we
think
you
can
go
on--
mr.
david
silberman
--i
understand.
that
certainly
was
our
intent
in
framing
the
second
question.
we
had
thought
we
had
framed
it
in
sufficiently
general
terms
to
enable
you
to
consider
the
question,
which
is
briefed
in
our
brief
and
in
respondents'
brief,
of
whether,
assuming
that
there
is
a
power
of
the
type
claimed
her,
its
exercise
in
this
case
was
appropriate.
we
obviously
think
it
was
not,
for
the
reason
you
state,
justice
white,
that
on
the
facts
there
was
not
basis
for
it,
but
moreover,
on
the
principles
basis
i
have
been
suggesting,
the
courts
don't
have
authority
to
do
that.
we
think
it
would
do
grave
damage
to
the
labor
policies
i
have
discussed
if
the
courts
were
free
to
do
that.
because
what
the
courts
do
when
they
say,
we're
not
going
to
enforce
a
lawful
contract,
is,
first,
the
courts
get
back
into
the
business
of
substantively
regulating
the
work
place
in
precisely
the
way
congress
said
we're
not
going
to
do
in
this
area.
mr.
david
silberman
justice
blackmun,
we
are
certainly
not
suggesting
that
smoking
marijuana
is
all
right
or
even
that
a
school
newspaper
couldn't
put
an
article
against
smoking
marijuana.
what
we
are
suggesting
is,
first,
that
certainly
the
interstate
commerce
commission
knows
people
who
license
bus
drivers
are
perfectly
free
to
make
the
judgment
as
to
whether
somebody
who
does
that
should
not
be
allowed
to
drive
a
bus.
mr.
david
silberman
i
think
so,
yes,
although
i
would
not
look
to
the
icc
for
help
in
that
regard.
but
yes,
i
mean,
at
first,
that
the
public--
mr.
david
silberman
--if
i
can
get
a
cab
after
court
this
afternoon,
your
honor.
we
do
say
that,
yes,
the
public
authorities
have
the
power
and
the
right,
if
they
wish,
to
say
that
this
person
is
not
suited
drive.
and
we
say
that
the
arbitrator
has
that
authority.
he
is
going
to
take
into
account
what
the
employer
has
done,
why
he
has
done
it,
is
this
somebody
who
was
under
enormous
pressure
at
home
in
a
way
that
is
not
likely
to
occur
again,
is
this
somebody
who
has
since
been
through
rehabilitation
and
to
whom
there
is
no
likelihood
of
it
recurring
again,
is
this
somebody
who
was
entrapped
in
a
way
and
that
this
is
not
something
likely
to
occur
again,
or
is
this
somebody
who
is
very
much
likely
to
do
it
again?
and
the
arbitrators
take
all
those
factors
into
account,
and
they
make
a
judgment
as
to
what
is
the
appropriate
disposition.
that
judgment
reflects,
in
essence,
the
parties'
judgment.
the
parties
have
said,
we
want
you
to
do
that
for
us
rather
than
leaving
that
to
the
employer
to
decide.
mr.
david
silberman
we
suggest
that
the
public
authorities
are
also
there
to
protect
the
public,
and
that
the
parties
themselves
are
not
going
to
agree
to
an
irrational
system
like
that.
ultimately
we
suggest
what
justice
trainor
said
in
the
california
supreme
court
in
probably
one
of
the
earliest
public
policy
cases,
and
that
is
the
case
of
black
v.
cutter
laboratories,
where
a
claim
was
made
that
it
was
against
public
policy
for
an
arbitrator
to
reinstate
a
communist,
in
the
1950's.
and
justice
trainor
said,
that
it's
a
rash
assumption
that
congress
and
the
legislature
have
been
inept
in
their
consideration
of
the
problem
or
are
incapable
of
meeting
it,
or
that
astride
the
unruly
horse
of
public
policy,
the
courts
are
better
able
to
meet
that
problem.
and
that
is
our
submission
as
well.
mr.
david
silberman
no,
that
was
the
dissenting
opinion,
although
i
believe
the
opinion
has
prevailed
in
the
verdict
of
history.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
david
silberman
your
honor,
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
i
wish
to
add.
mr.
david
silberman
the
answer
is
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
silberman
no,
i
don't
think
our
principle
reaches
that
conclusion,--
mr.
david
silberman
--because
if...
i
need
to
break
that
hypothetical
down
into
two
possible
scenarios.
one
is
where
the
arbitrator
has
made
factual
findings
which
says
that
this
guy
is
guilty
of
these
acts,
but
that
i
don't
have
the
authority
to
sustain
the
discharge--
mr.
david
silberman
--no,
i
think
that
if...
as
i
understand
the
hypothetical...
there
is
a
prohibition
on
employing
a
particular
individual
and
a
procedural
rule
in
a
contract
which
leads
an
arbitrator
to
order
the
employment
of
an
individual
who
public
law
says
is
not
to
be
employed,
then
it
is
entirely
consistent
with...
our
principle
would
say
that
award
is
against
public
policy
because
it
is
ordering
the
employer
to
do
something
he
is
not
permitted
to
do.
even
though
the
contract
itself
was
lawful,
the
remedy...
the
order
there
ordered
the
employer
to
do
something
he
is
not
permitted
to
do.
