justice
scalia
if
i
understand
judge
easterbrook's
thesis,
it
is
that
the
arbitrator
does
nothing
but
give
content
to
the
words
of
the
contract,
and
if
the
contract,
as
worded
by
the
arbitrator,
would
not,
if
it
had
been
written
that
way,
be
contrary
to
law,
neither
is
the
arbitrator's
decision.
so
that,
in
the
instance
that
you
just
cited,
if
a
contract
is
not
unlawful,
which
does
not
provide
for
the
firing
of
someone
who
smokes
marijuana
in
the
parking
lot,
if
such
a
contract
without
that
provision
is
lawful,
then
the
arbitrator's
statement,
that
you
can't
fire
this
fellow
for
smoking
marijuana
in
the
parking
lot,
is
also
lawful.
justice
scalia
there
is
still
a
good
deal
of
room
between
that
and
saying
you
do
nothing
but
enforce
the
statutes
that
are
on
the
book.
that
is
to
say,
there
are
some
things
which
you
can't
write
into
a
contract,
they
will
not
be
enforced
even
there
is
not
provision
of
law
which
says
that
they
are
unlawful.
i
mean,
there
is
a
long
line
of
contracts
cases
refusing
to
enforce
contracts
as
being
contrary
to
public
policy.
not
because
they
violate
any
explicit
statute,
but
because
what
they
permit
or
encourage
would
violate
a
statute.
so
what
judge
easterbrook
said
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
only
when
there
is
an
explicit
statute
making
this
conduct
unlawful
is
it
bad.
justice
scalia
is
that
any
different
from
what
the
law
says
with
regard
to
any
contract?
it
favors
private
disposition
of
their
affairs.
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
an
ordinary
non-labor
contract:
we
will
enforce
what
the
parties
themselves
provide,
up
to
a
point.
justice
scalia
can
he
adopt
the
public
policy
principle
and
say
he
will
not
interpret
any
provision
of
the
contract
to
be
contrary
to
sound
public
policy?
and
if
he
does
that,
can
the
courts
enforce
it?
justice
scalia
--would
you
say
that
a
contract
violated
public
policy
and
was
unenforceable
to
that
extent
if
it
failed
to
provide
for
the
dismissal
of
an
employee
who
had
marijuana
on
the
premises
in
any
industry?
justice
scalia
well,
then
why
is
it
a
violation
of
public
policy
here,
not
to
have
such
a
rule,
which
is
all
the
arbitrator
said.
the
arbitrator
said,
this
contract
does
not
have
such
a
rule.
now
maybe
another
contract--
justice
scalia
--are
you
saying
any
factually
finding
that
is
erroneous,
relating
to
marijuana
use,
by
an
arbitrator,
is
contrary
to
public
policy?
justice
scalia
i
am
trying
to
get
the
nub
of
what
it
is
in
this
thing
that
is
contrary
to
public
policy.
justice
scalia
all
right,
but
the
arbitrator
obviously
didn't
agree.
he
thought
the
evidence
was
inadmissable
or
he
didn't
believe
the
evidence,
one
or
the
other.
so
you
really
are
saying
that
what's
contrary
to
public
policy
is
not
accepting
evidence
of
this
degree.
justice
scalia
i
suppose
what
you
are
saying
is
what
really
violated
public
policy
was
ordering
him
back
on
the
job?
justice
scalia
what's
really
contrary
to
public
policy
here
is
to
refuse
to
be
persuaded
by
that
degree
of
evidence
that
this
fellow
was
a
drug
user.
justice
scalia
i
have
one
question.
i
am
going
to
give
you
the
hardest
case
i
can
think
of
and
see
whether
you'll
adhere
to
your
principle.
justice
scalia
well,
i
want
to
see
how
your
principle
works
out.
let's
assume
that
there's
a
state
law
that
prevents
the
employment
of
anyone
that
has
a
history
of
child
molestation
in
a
day
care
center.
and
there's
a
contract
with
the
union;
the
contract
says
anyone
can
be
fired
for
a
history
of
child
molestation.
but
the
contract
also
says
that
any
disciplining
for
any
matter
that
involves
moral
opprobrium
shall
only
be
made
on
the
testimony
of
three
witnesses
to
the
event.
now
there
is
one
individual...
it
is
clear
on
the
basis
of
a
lot
evidence,
photographic,
documentary,
and
everything
else,
the
fellow
has
a
long
history
of
child
molestation,
but
in
no
one
of
these
instances
were
there
three
eye
witnesses
to
the
event.
and
the
thing
goes
to
arbitration,
the
arbitrator
says,
that's
the
way
the
contract
reads,
you
don't
have
the
three
witnesses,
that's
not
the
evidence
the
contract
requires,
you
can't
be
fired.
a
court
would
have
to
enforce
that?
justice
scalia
why
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
no,
he
hasn't
made
the
finding,
but
the
court
that
reviews
the
thing
can
see
that
that
is
absolutely
the
case.
but
he
hasn't
found
that,
he
has
just
said,
you
didn't
meet
the
procedural
rules,
just
as
the
arbitrator
here
said.
but
the
point
is
that
those
procedural
rules
make
it
so
difficult
for
the
employer
to
enforce
the
public
policy
that
the
argument
is
a
contract
with
that
unrealistic
a
condition
for
dismissing
somebody
for
the
reason
the
law
requires
is
contrary
to
public
policy.
you
would
not
allow
that?
