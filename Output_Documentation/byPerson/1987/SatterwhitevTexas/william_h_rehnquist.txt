chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
86-6284,
john
t.
satterwhite
v.
texas.
mr.
woods,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
wouldn't
texas
practice
ordinarily
provide
that
if
there's
an
attorney
of
record
for
the
defendant,
that
a
copy
of
that...
at
least
a
proposed
formal
order
would
be
served?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
not
directly
challenging
either
the
holbrook
or
the
other
expert
testimony,
are
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
the
other,
the
schroeder.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
not
saying
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
have
permitted
her
to
testify?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
now,
was
that
point
raised
in
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals?
chief
justice
rehnquist
much
more,
almost
to
the
exclusion
of--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--so,
but,
now,
do
you
challenge
the
schroeder
testimony
here,
not
having
challenged
it
in
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
did
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
do
with
the
motion
for
rehearing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
woods.
mr.
palmer,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
is
that
ordinary
practice
in
texas,
that
you
expect
a
lawyer
for
a
party
to
the
case
to
be
bound
by
an
order
of
which
he
had
never
seen
a
copy,
that
was
simply
put
in
the
case
file?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
much
would
depend
on
local
practice,
it
seems
to
me,
and
there's
really
no
representation
or
anything
very
authoritative
here
about
what
the
practice
in
texas
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
palmer.
mr.
woods,
you
have
fifteen
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
now,
does
this
ordinarily
require
a
motion?
does
the
state
ordinarily
make
a
motion
to
the
judge
for
an
examination?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
supposing
the
state
wants
an
examination
of
a
defendant
by
an
expert
witness,
is
that
ordinarily
accomplished
by
a
motion
under
texas
procedure?
chief
justice
rehnquist
not
just
an
order
filed
by
the
judge?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
here,
i
gather,
at
least
there's
no
record
of
any
motion
having
been
made
and
just
the
order
filed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
it
in
one
document,
a
motion
and
an
order?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
say
that
the
defense
attorney
got...
was
served
copies
of
neither
the
motion
nor
the
order?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
when
your
opposing
party
makes
a
motion,
not
necessarily
in
a
capital
case,
but
just
in
the
run-of-the-mind
criminal
case,
in
a
run-of-the-mind
civil
case,
doesn't
he
ordinarily
serve
opposing
counsel
with
a
copy
of
the
motion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
doesn't
that
practice
pertain
in
criminal
cases,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
woods.
the
case
is
submitted.
