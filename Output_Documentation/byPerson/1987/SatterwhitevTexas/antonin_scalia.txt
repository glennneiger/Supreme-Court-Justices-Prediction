justice
scalia
is
this
the
schroeder
order
or
the
grigson
order?
justice
scalia
i
thought
that
the
order
pursuant
to
which
schroeder
examined
your
client
was
entered
before
you
were
appointed.
justice
scalia
what
order
is
it
we're
talking
about?
what
were
the
contents
of
the
order
entered
on
april
18th?
justice
scalia
was
there
a
finding
by
the
texas
court
that
it
was
on
file?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
what
i'm
saying,
if
mr.
woods
is
wrong
about,
you
know,
if
he
says
it
wasn't
there,
maybe
that
should
have
been
raised
before
the
texas
court?
is
there
a
finding
by
the
texas
court?
justice
scalia
why
is
that
implicit
in
the
decision?
justice
scalia
maybe
your
appointment
was
just
noted,
put
in
the
file,
and
no
notice
sent
to
him.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
the
judge,
it
was
the
same
judge,
so
the
judge
certainly
knew
it.
