justice
o'connor
mr.
woods,
what's
the
role
of
defense
counsel
in
connection
with
one
of
these
examinations
by
a
psychiatrist
in
texas?
justice
o'connor
the
attorney
doesn't
actually
sit
in
and
participate
at
the
time
of
the
examination.
justice
o'connor
but
it
doesn't
normally
occur,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
it
would
simply
be
a
matter
of
consultation
of
some
kind
with
the
defendant
in
advance
of
the
examination?
justice
o'connor
now,
there
were
two
other
doctors
appointed
in
this
instance
to
examine
mr.
satterwhite,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
and
in
each
case,
did
his
attorney
advise...
were
you
representing
him
below?
justice
o'connor
did
you
talk
to
him
in
advance
of
those...
each
of
those
examinations?
justice
o'connor
there
was
a
psychologist
who
did.
justice
o'connor
yes,
and
did
you
talk
to
mr.
satterwhite
before
that
examination?
justice
o'connor
and
not
again?
justice
o'connor
that
testimony
is
not
challenged.
justice
o'connor
now,
what
was
the
april
18th
order
signed
by
the
court?
justice
o'connor
and
you
knew
about
that
order?
justice
o'connor
never?
justice
o'connor
never
looked
at
the
file?
justice
o'connor
you
did
not
see
that
order
in
the
file?
justice
o'connor
but
it
was
there?
justice
o'connor
i'm
talking
about
the
april
18th
order.
justice
o'connor
now,
when
was
the
order
appointing
dr.
grigson
entered
by
the
court,
do
you
know?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
court
did
something
or
he
wouldn't
have
made
examination
presumably.
justice
o'connor
relying
on
the
appointment
of
dr.
holbrook.
justice
o'connor
did
they
practice
together?
is
that--
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
woods,
let
me
ask
you
this.
you
say
no
harmless
error
standard
can
be
applied.
what
if
the
state
had
not
put
dr.
grigson
on
the
stand
but,
in
fact,
had
had
dr.
grigson
examine
the
defendant
and
simply
didn't
use
the
testimony?
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument,
that
that's
error
and
it's
error
per
se?
justice
o'connor
why
not?
you're
saying
that
it's
the
appointment
without
notice
to
you
that
creates
the
problem.
justice
o'connor
no,
no,
no
notice
provided
to
you.
just
like
you
say
happened
here,
and
dr.
grigson
examined
the
defendant
but
the
state
doesn't
try
to
use
the
testimony.
justice
o'connor
so,
we
do
apply
harmless
error
then
in
the
question?
justice
o'connor
then,
why
shouldn't
we
apply
harmless
error
here?
justice
o'connor
so,
you
don't
object
to
that
really?
justice
o'connor
and
it
would
be
your
submission
then
that
in
this
case,
error
was
not
harmless?
justice
o'connor
mr.
palmer,
what...
where
do
we
find
the
court
order
appointing
dr.
grigson?
justice
o'connor
were
they
practicing
psychiatry
together?
justice
o'connor
is
there
any
evidence
of
record
that
defense
counsel
was
sent
a
copy
or
otherwise
served
with
a
copy
of
that
april
18th
order?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
is
a
requirement?
notice
to
counsel
of
proposed
examination?
justice
o'connor
has
this
court
ever
held
that?
justice
o'connor
has
the
texas
court
ever
held
that?
justice
o'connor
mr.
palmer,
this...
the
testimony
of
dr.
grigson,
though,
was
the...
am
i
correct
that
it
was
the
only
expert
testimony
by
a
psychiatric
on
the
matter
of
future
dangerousness?
justice
o'connor
mr.
woods,
is
there
no
local
rule
of
practice
governing
notice
to
be
given
to
counsel
in
criminal
cases?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
know
of
a
rule
that
says
notice
must
be
given?
justice
o'connor
have
you
checked
the
local
rules?
justice
o'connor
not
in
preparation
for
this
case,
i
take
it?
