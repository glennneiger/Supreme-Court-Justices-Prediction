justice
white
isn't
there
a
copy
of
that
for
each
case?
justice
white
well,
has
it
ever
been
entered?
justice
white
i
suppose
if
it's
on
the
docket,
entered
on
the
docket
sheet
and
there's
a
date
on
it,
that's
what
you
usually
look
at
to
see
what's
in
a
file.
justice
white
did
you
look
at
it?
justice
white
well,
don't
you
think
you
ought
to
look
at
the
docket
sheet?
justice
white
do
you
accept
that,
that
he
was
examining
him
pursuant
to
some
order?
justice
white
you
don't
suggest
that
your
opposition
has
abandoned
the
notion
that
it
was
harmful?
justice
white
no.
justice
white
do
you
think
we're
bound
by
that
abandonment?
you
don't
think
we're
free
to
decide
this
kind
of
error
could
never
be
harmless?
having
dr.
grigson,
who
is
a
professional
witness
in
these
cases.
he's
a
specialist
in
testifying
on
capital
punishment
cases,
isn't
he,
or
he
was?
justice
white
was
the
defendant
required
to
submit
for
the
examination?
justice
white
well,
but
he
did
and
i
suppose
that
counsel
might
have
advised
him
not
to
submit.
justice
white
well,
more
likely,
if
the
counsel
is
told,
he
would
say,
well,
i
guess
that
phase
of
it
is
over,
they
aren't
going
to
do
it
again.
justice
white
wouldn't
you
sort
of
think
that?
one
is
enough.
usually
it
is.
justice
white
yeah.
mr.
woods,
i
think,
told
us
that...
i
think
you've
just
said
that
that
order
of
april
18th
was
in
the
file
at
least
two
weeks?
justice
white
part
of
your
submission
was
that
the
lack
of
notice
was
irrelevant
as
long
as
the
order
is
on
file.
the
attorney
is
charged
with
everything...
with
notice
of
everything
in
the
file,
is
that
it?
justice
white
what
city
was
this
in?
justice
white
san
antonio.
that's
a
pretty
big
city,
isn't
it?
justice
white
i
mean,
you
usually
don't
run
over
to
the
clerk's
office
every
day
to
see
what's
been
filed
in
the
cases
that
you
are
involved
in.
justice
white
well,
the
purpose
of
the
examination
was
for
what?
justice
white
competence?
justice
white
but
if
there's
some
question
of
competence,
i
suppose
the
district
judge
or
the
trial
judge
has
got
some
obligation
of
his
own
to
respond,
if
there's
some
question
in
his
mind
about
competency,
wholly
aside
from
any
motion.
he
could
and
should
order
an
examination,
shouldn't
he?
