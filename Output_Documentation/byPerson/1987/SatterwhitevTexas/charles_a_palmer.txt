mr.
charles
a.
palmer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
disputing
the
harmless
error
finding
of
the
court
below,
the
briefs
filed
by
satterwhite
and
by
the
amicus
advance
essentially
two
arguments.
the
first
being
that
this
type
of
error
can
never
be
harmless,
and
as
i
understand
mr.
woods,
he's
abandoned
that
argument
here
today.
the
second
argument
then,
and
the
issue
for
the
court
to
decide,
is
whether
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
state
proved
that
dr.
grigson's
testimony
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
we
have
made
an
argument
that
there
was
no
sixth
amendment
violation
in
connection
with
dr.
grigson's
examination
of
satterwhite.
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
we
are
wrong
on
that
point,
given
the
trial
record
before
this
court,
any
error
in
the
admission
of
dr.
grigson's
testimony
certainly
was
harmless.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
one
of
the
arguments
made
at
some
length
in
the
amicus
brief
was
that
this
particular
type
of
error
can
never
be
harmless,
and
i
understand
that
argument
to
be
abandoned.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
he
was,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
i
don't
know
what
dr.
grigson's
record
is.
i
assume
the
state
him
just
as
they
use
any
other
witness,
expert
or
otherwise,
because
they
believe
he
is
persuasive.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no
reason
to
doubt
it.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
dr.
grigson's
testimony
was
not
as
critical
to
the
state's
case
on
punishment
as
satterwhite
would
have
the
court
believe.
it
is
true
that
his
testimony
was
important
in
that
it
went
to
an
ultimate
issue
on
punishment,
one
of
the
two
special
issues
submitted
to
the
punishment
phase
of
the
texas
capital
trial.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
he
was
the
only
medical
doctor.
there
was
testimony
from
a
psychologist,
dr.
schroeder,
whose
testimony
was
very
similar
to
that
of
dr.
grigson.
her
diagnosis
of
satterwhite
was
virtually
the
same
as
that
of
dr.
grigson,
and
there
was
no
evidence
by
satterwhite
to
the
contrary,
psychiatric
or
otherwise.
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
presented
by
satterwhite
in
either
the
guilt
or
the
punishment
phases.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
your
honor,
i--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--i
would
not
agree
with
that.
i've
never
met
the
man
or
heard
him
testify.
i
don't
have
a
personal
opinion,
but
it's
the
state's
position
in
this
case
that
a
particular
witness'
testimony
cannot
be
deemed
to
be
never
harmless
simply
because
he
is
a
persuasive
witness.
under
traditional
harmless
error
analysis,
the
court
looks
at
the
entire
record
of
the
case
and
considers
the
number
of
factors,
including
whether
the
state's
case
is
overwhelming,
whether
the
evidence
is
cumulative,
whether
it
was
important.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
dr.
holbrook,
who--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--again,
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
the
prosecution
of
this
case
is
in
the
trial
court.
whoever
handled
it
at
the
local
district
attorney's
office.
there
is
no
coordination.
their
office
is
in
the
attorney
general's
office.
so
i
simply
unaware.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
there
is
no
court
order
appointing
dr.
grigson.
there
was
an
order
entered
on
april
18th
appointing
dr.
holbrook
and
i
think,
as
mr.
woods
has
stated,
it
was
dr.
grigson
performing
the
examination
instead
of
dr.
holbrook.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
your
honor,
i
do
not
know,
and
i
don't
want
to
represent
that
as
a
fact
to
the
court,
but
i'm
under
the
impression
that
they
were.
they
were
both
used
extensively
in
capital
trials
at
this
time
in
texas.
dr.--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
certainly,
your
honor,
and
we
have
argued
that
counsel
is
effectively
put
on
notice
by
the
fact
that
the
court
order
was
filed
in
the
record
of
the
case,
was
filed
the
same
day
it
was
entered,
april
18th,
some
two
weeks
prior
to
the
examination.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
again,
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
what's
ordinary
practice
statewide.
apparently,
in
1979,
in
bexar
county,
this
was
a
common
practice.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
he
was
not.
if
i
may
back
up
a
moment,--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--he
might
have.
our
argument
that
counsel
was
put
on
notice
is
really
twofold;
one
being
the
fact
that
the
order
was
on
file
for
two
weeks
prior
to
the
examination,
and
the
second
part
being
that
prior
to
counsel
being
appointed,
satterwhite
had
been
examined
by
dr.
schroeder,
at
which
time
he
waived
his
sixth
amendment
right.
between
the
time
of
dr.
schroeder's
examination
and
that
of
dr.
grigson,
counsel
was
appointed.
it
strains
credulity
to
assert
that
satterwhite
and
counsel
did
not
discuss
the
previous
examination
and
any
possible
future
examinations
in
light
of
that.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
at
the
time
counsel
was
appointed,
there
had
been
one
examination
requested
and
performed.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
that
competent
counsel
would
tell
his
client,
hey,
don't
let
them
do
this
to
you
again.
if
this
happens
again,
don't
submit.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
that's
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
perhaps
so.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
it
was
in
the
file
as
of
april
18th.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
the
order
is
in
the
transcript
before
the
court.
it
was
file
marked
april
18th.
stamped
with
the
clerk's
stamp,
showing
it
as
filed
on
that
date.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no.
the
only
docket
sheet
in
the
transcript,
your
honor,
is
the
trial
docket
sheet
of
the
proceedings
in
open
court.
but
the
order
in
question
very
definitely
bears
the
clerk's
stamp,
showing
when
it
was
filed.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
i
have
no
reason
to
disbelieve
mr.
woods
on
any
point.
i'm
simply
telling
the
court
what
the
record
reveals.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
it's
in
the
transcript
which
is
in
the
court's
possession,
along
with
the
entire
trial
records.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
the
file
is
maintained--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--no,
your
honor.
this
is
the
file
of
the
district
clerk.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
it
has
a
stamp
saying
it's
filed
by
the
district
clerk's
office,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
i
don't--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--there
was
not
a
specific
finding
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
implicit
in
the
decision
of
the
texas
court
is
that
assuming
it
was
on
file,
it
was
inadequate
notice.
i
believe
that's
the
legal
conclusion.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
because,
as
a
matter
of
record,
the
thing
was
filed
and
was
stamped
filed.
it's
entitled
to
presumption
of
regularity
and
the
defense
has
never
questioned
that
it
was
filed
on
that
date.
mr.
woods
represented
he
didn't
see
it
when
he
saw
the
file,
but
there's
no
reason
to
doubt
it
was
filed
on
the
date
it
shows
to
have
been
filed,
and
if
it
was
filed
on
that
date,
then
i
can
only
surmise
that
that
is
implicit
in
the
court's
holding
that
it
was
not
sufficient.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
that
is
our
first
argument.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
i'm
not
aware
that
they
have.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
san
antonio.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
this
examination
was
conducted
in
violation
of
satterwhite's
right
to
counsel,
we
would
submit
that
certainly
in
this
record
any
error
was
harmless.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
this
is
true.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
i
don't
know
that
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
but,
again,
the
letter
was
placed
in
the
file
on
that
same
day.
at
the
punishment
hearing,
the
punishment
hearing
lasted
five
and
a
half
hours,
dr.
grigson
was
one
of
a
number
of
witnesses.
there
were
eight
witnesses
to
satterwhite's
bad
reputation.
there
was
testimony
by
the
psychologist,
dr.
schroeder,
whose
diagnosis
of
satterwhite
was
the
same
as
that
of
dr.
grigson.
there
was
testimony
about
satterwhite's
prior
criminal
record,
two
misdemeanor
convictions,
two
felony
convictions.
there
was
testimony
about
satterwhite's
violent
nature.
a
year
and
a
half
before
the
capital
offense,
he
attacked
his
blind
father-in-law
in
the
man's
home,
shot
him
twice
through
the
door,
put
him
in
the
hospital
for
a
month.
some
six
months
prior
to
this
capital
offense,
he
was
arrested
for
carrying
a
concealed
weapon
which
he
attempted
to
pull
from
his
waist
band
and
use
it
on
a
policeman
who
accosted
him.
in
the
face
of
all
of
this
very
damaging
testimony,
satterwhite
presented
no
evidence
whatsoever,
no
psychiatric
testimony,
a
reputation
evidence,
nothing.
it's...
as
i
said,
the
punishment
hearing
lasted
five
and
a
half
hours,
and
we
really
can't
tell
from
the
record
how
long
dr.
grigson
was
on
the
stand,
but
it
was
certainly
not
the
bulk
of
that
time
or
anything
approaching
it.
now,
as
far
as
how
the
prosecutor
relied
on
the
testimony,
again
the
record
doesn't
show
how
much
time
elapsed
during
the
final
argument
on
punishment,
but
it
does
show
in
the
printed
statement
of
facts
of
the
trial
that
the
prosecutor's
argument
occupied
291
lines
of
argument,
nine
of
those
were
devoted
to
dr.
grigson.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
not
heavy
reliance
on
dr.
grigson's
testimony.
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
this
type...
well,
perhaps
i
should
back
up
a
moment.
only
last
term
in
buchanan
v.
kentucky,
the
court
stated
that
this
type
of
error
can
be
harmless.
in
buchanan,
the
defendant
claimed
that
he
was
examined
in
violation
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
that
there
was
error
in
the
admission
of
psychiatric
testimony.
the
court
rejected
that,
holding
there
was
no
estelle
v.
smith
violation
and
then
also
stated,
however,
even
if
there
had
been,
it
would
be
harmless.
so,
i
think
there's
no
substance
whatsoever
to
satterwhite's
argument
that
this
particular
type
of
error
cannot
be
harmless.
that
being
so,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
certainly
on
this
record,
it
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
when
the
state
puts
on
overwhelming
evidence
to
support
the
issues
on
punishment
and
when
the
defendant
puts
on
no
evidence
whatsoever,
and
when
the
complained-of
testimony
is
essentially
the
same
as
that
of
properly-admitted
testimony,
it
would
seem
that
any
error
was
harmless
beyond
any
doubt
whatsoever.
satterwhite
has
chosen
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
dr.
grigson
testified
on
a
critical
issue
and
from
that
argues
that
this
can
never
be
harmless.
however,
the
admission
of
a
confession
taken
in
violation
of
miranda
can
be
harmless.
certainly,
dr.
grigson's
testimony
on
punishment
is
no
more
damaging
to
the
defendant
than
his
own
word
inculpating
himself.
if
that
sort
of
error
could
be
harmless,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
this
can,
too,
and
that
on
this
record,
it
certainly
was.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
that
is
true,
your
honor.
thank
you.
