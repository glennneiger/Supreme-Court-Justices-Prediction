justice

and
you
didn't

some
time?
justice
jr.
did
the
same
judge
that
appointed
you
sign
the
order
of
april
18th?
justice
jr.
and
didn't
send
you
a
copy
after
he
appointed
you?
justice
jr.
well,
now,
where
do
you
get
that?
i
thought
mr.
woods
had
told
us
he
looked
at
the
file
twice
and
there
was
no
order
then.
justice
jr.
is
there
a
docket
sheet?
is
it
listed
on
the
docket
sheet?
justice
jr.
do
you
disbelieve
the
representation
to
us
that
when
he
looked
at
it,
it
wasn't
there?
justice
jr.
do
you
know
whether
or
not
we
possibly
got
a
copy
of
that
order
of
april
18th?
justice
jr.
mr.
woods,
you
had
been
appointed
ten
days
before
the
order
of
april
18th.
justice
jr.
eight
days
before.
the
prosecutor
knew
of
your
appointment?
justice
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
this.
if
he
knew
that
you
were
representing
and
he
filed
a
motion
for
the
judge
without
sending
a
copy
to
you.
justice
jr.
you
were
there?
justice
jr.
and
then
he
filed
a
motion
on
the
18th
and
didn't
send
you
a
copy?
