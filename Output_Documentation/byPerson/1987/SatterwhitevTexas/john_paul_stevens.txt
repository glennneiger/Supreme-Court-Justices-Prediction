justice
stevens
and
doesn't
the
state
him
because
he's
particularly
persuasive
to
juries?
doesn't
he
have
a
record
of
seventy-nine
out
of
eighty
or
something
like
that?
justice
stevens
because
they
believe
he'll
be
persuasive
to
the
jury.
justice
stevens
and
do
we
have
any
reason
to
doubt
that
he
was
persuasive
to
the
jury
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
then,
how
could
we
say
it
was
harmless?
how
could
we
possibly
say
it
was
harmless?
justice
stevens
wasn't
he
the
only
doctor
who
testified
on
that
issue?
justice
stevens
how
could
he
have
discussed
the
possible
future
examinations
when
they
hadn't
even
been
requested?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
i
know,
but
you're
saying
that
the
client
should
have
told
the
lawyer
that
another
examination
which
hadn't
even
been
requested
might
take
place.
justice
stevens
well,
we
do
know
that
dr.
grigson
must
have
because
on
may
8th,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
judge
reporting
on
the
results
of
his
examination.
justice
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
a
copy
of
dr.
grigson's
letter
to
the
judge
went
to
the
defendant
or
his
counsel?
justice
stevens
i
couldn't
find
any
indication
of
it.
justice
stevens
beyond
that,
isn't
it
also
typical
in
your
motion
to
include
a
proof
of
service
or
some
kind
of
an
indication
that
the
opposing
counsel
received
notice?
justice
stevens
the
record
doesn't
show
that.
justice
stevens
and
tried
the
lawsuit.
same
judge
tried
the
case,
didn't
he?
justice
stevens
what
about
judge...
i
mean,
dr.
grigson's
letter
of
may
8th?
did
he
send
you
a
copy
of
that?
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
they
like
you
very
much.
