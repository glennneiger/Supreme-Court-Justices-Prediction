mr.
richard
d.
woods
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
criminal
case
from
the
state
of
texas,
involving
a
death
penalty
which
was
imposed
on
the
petitioner,
and
a
case
that
was
tried
in
1979,
error
complained
of
and
the
question
presented
before
the
court
is
whether
there
was
a
denial
of
effective
assistance
to
counsel
in
the
allowing
of
testimony
of
dr.
james
p.
grigson,
a
dallas
psychiatrist,
during
the
punishment
phase
of
the
defendant's
trial.
the
complained-of
error
is
couched
on
this
court's
decision
in
estelle
v.
smith
in
that
counsel
was
not
advised
nor
notified
previously
to
the
order
appointing
dr.
grigson
to
examine
the
defendant
for
two
reasons.
one
was
for
the
purpose
of
determining
competency
to
stand
trial
and
the
other
was
the
purpose
of
determining
future
dangerousness.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
yes,
sir,
it
was.
this
order
was
signed
and
filed
by
the
district
attorney's
office,
the
prosecutor
in
san
antonio,
texas,
on
april
18th,
1979.
trial
counsel
was
appointed
april
10th,
1979.
the
order
was
submitted
to
the
court
in
whose
case,
the
petitioner's
case,
was
indicted.
so,
counsel
should
have
been
advised
prior
to
at
least
the
examination
of
the
defendant.
the
defendant
was
not
examined
by
dr.
grigson
till
may
3rd
of
1979.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
no.
i
believe
he's
still
practicing.
i
don't
believe
he
is
testifying
anymore
in
these
types
of
cases,
at
least
i
have
not
heard.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
justice,
the
role
as
far
as
the
defense
counsel
would
be
is
to
determine
or
to
at
least
advise
the
client
of
the
scope
of
the
examination.
let
him
know
what
the
impact
of
it
could
be,
what
ramifications
could
be
derived
from
it.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
such
a
request,
of
course,
was
not
made
and
i
don't
think
the
attorney
would
necessarily--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
to
let
him
know
what
the
ramifications
could
possibly
be
as
to
the
examination.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
yes.
that
was
dr.
holbrook,
i
believe.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
yes,
i
was.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i
was
not
advised.
first
of
all,
dr.
holbrook
did
not
examine
mr.
satterwhite.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
dr.
betty
lou
schroeder.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
dr.
schroeder
examined
mr.
satterwhite
on
march
16th,
before
i
was
appointed
to
represent
him.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
the
testimony
that
was
elicited
in
the
trial
shows
that
she
talked
to
him
on
several
occasions.
now,
specifically
when
is
unknown
to
anybody.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
well,
basically,
it
is
challenged,
but,
of
course,
it's
challenged
through
the
means
of
the
complaint
of
dr.
grigson,
because
of
dr.
grigson's
impact
on
the
jury,
which,
of
course,
is
buttressed
by
the
state's
argument.
they
argued
and
supported
their
position
for
the
death
penalty
and
for
the
affirmative
findings
of
special
issue
number
2,
stating
that
dr.
grigson's
a
dallas
psychiatrist
and
a
medical
doctor
and
not
referring
to
just
a
mere
county-employed
psychologist.
and,
so,
the
impact
to
the
jury
was
very
great.
of
course,
the
impact
of
dr.
grigson
to
any
jury
is
devastating
and
it's
for
those
reasons
for
which,
of
course,--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--that
was
the...
there
was
an
order
signed.
that
was
the
order
for
appointment
of
a
dr.
holbrook
and
dr.
schroeder
to
examine
the
defendant
for
purposes
of
mental
competency.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
no,
ma'am.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
did
not...
was
not
told.
i
was
not
advised.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i
saw
the
file
several
times.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
well,
i
can
only
tell
you
from
my
own
personal
observation
and
knowledge,
i
didn't
see
that
order
in
the
file--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--well,
i
tell
you,
i
saw
the
file
on,
i
can
say,
two
occasions,
both
of
which
i
did
not
see
the
order
in
the
file
nor
did
i
see
dr.
grigson's
letter
that
he
wrote
on
may
3rd.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
the
april
18th
order
did
not
surface
until
after,
i'd
say
it
was,
about
the
middle
of
may,
and
that's
when
i
prepared
several
motions
which
were
filed
may
29th.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
the
entry
of
a
docket
sheet
as
to
that
particular
order,
if
made,
and
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me
right
now,
was
not
necessarily
entered,
as
i
could
see.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i
don't
remember.
i
couldn't
tell
you.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i
looked.
i
did
look
at
the
docket
sheet
because
sometimes
they
keep--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--well,
that's
true,
but,
your
honor,
the
point
is
that
in
examining
the
file...
first
of
all,
the
order
that
was
presented
in
front
of
the
judge,
after
i
was
appointed
as
counsel,
was
not
even...
in
fact,
i
was
not
even
provided
any
notice
for
it.
without
notice--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
yes.
in
every
court
i've
practiced
in,
there's
always
been
a
notice
or
certificate
of
service
to
opposing
counsel.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
april
10th,
i
believe,
yes.
i
was--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--that's
the
date
the
order
was
signed
by
the
judge.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i
didn't
see
it
until
mid-may.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
this
is
actually
the
holbrook
order.
there
was
never
an
order
for
dr.
grigson.
he
came
in
under
the
guise
of
the
holbrook
order.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
yes,
sir.
that
order
was
entered
the
day
after
he
was
arrested.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
the
contents
of
the
order
on
april
18th
dealt
with
the
appointment
of
drs.
holbrook
and
schroeder
to
examine
john
satterwhite
for
purposes
of
determining
competency
to
stand
trial
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
would
be
a
continuing
threat
to
society
in
the
future.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
there
was
no
expert
testimony
from
holbrook.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i
am
effectively
challenging--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--her
testimony
came
in
based
upon
her
examination
at
a
time
prior
to
counsel
being
appointed
and
then,
as
she
testified,
at
a
time
after
counsel
was
appointed.
she
said
and
the
record
should
reflect
that
she
was
aware
of
counsel
being
appointed
but
did
not
notify
counsel
of
her
examinations.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
the
point
was
raised
more
towards
dr.
grigson
than
it
was--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--i'll
have
to
agree.
that's
true.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
well,
it
was
challenged
in
the
motion
for
rehearing
in
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
they
did
not
write
an
opinion.
they
denied
the
motion
for
rehearing.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
there
was
no
order
for
dr.
grigson
ever
submitted.
the
only
thing
that
was--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--the
court...
dr.
grigson
acted
in
the
stead
of
dr.
holbrook.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i
don't
recall
where
exactly
dr.
holbrook
is
from.
he
is
from
the
north
texas
area,
i
believe.
he
may
also
be
from
dallas.
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
well,
of
course,
technically,
he
was
not
in
the
body
of
the
order.
he
testified
that
he
examined
the
defendant
as
per
a
court
order,
which
was
arranged
through
the
district
attorney's
office.
that
is
the
basis
of
what
his
testimony
was.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i
can
only
accept
that
because
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
trial
judge
on
may
8th,
about
five
days
after
he
examined
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
there
is
not.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
no
copy.
it's
not
so
much
the
substance
of
the
testimony,
of
the
psychiatric
testimony
or
the
psychological
testimony,
it's
the
lack
of
notice
to
counsel,
the
opportunity
to
at
least
advise
the
client
of
what
the
ramifications
of
the
examination
could
be.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
if
dr.
grigson
did
not
testify,
i
may
not
be
here
today.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
if
dr.
grigson
had,
as
was
in
barefoot
v.
texas,
if
dr.
grigson
had,
in
fact,...
notice
been
provided
to
counsel
and
he
did
examine
him--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--well,
if
the
state
didn't
use
the
testimony,
of
course,
there's
no
harm
to
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
well,
i
believe
you'd
almost
have
to,
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
well,
i
have
seen
some
decisions
which
this
court
has...
there
seems
to
be
a
trend
towards
harmless
error
doctrine
or
chapman
towards
these
cases
in
which--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--well,
because
of
the
trends
of
the
court
and
the
law
of
this
land,
i
would
say
no.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
exactly.
and
as
far
as
the
harm
to
be
effected,
we
have
to,
of
course,
look
at
what
a
jury
is
going
to
do.
is
a
jury...
and
do
we
have
any
type
of
a
standard
in
which
we
can
say
what
a
jury
is
going
to
say.
i
think
as
this
court
said
in
cal
v.
romulus,
california
v.
romulus,
that
there's
no
objective
or
normative
marker
available
to
say
what
a
jury
is
really
thinking,
and
if,
in
fact,
there
is
a
harm
or
at
least
there
is
the
error
and
if
the
error
is
of
constitutional
dimensions,
such
as
in
estelle
v.
smith,
without
the
notice,
then
this
defendant
has
been
harmed
because
the
jury
very
well
could
have
used
that
testimony,
even
though
there
may
have
been
some
very
horrible
fact
situations
underlying
the
prosecution.
we
don't
know,
and
for
that
reason,
we
cannot
really
peer
into
the
minds
of
the
jury
and
see
exactly
what
they
would
do,
and
it's
on
that
basis
that
i
believe
that
harm
has
been
made.
it
is
the
conduct
so
much
not
of
a
state
agency
as
it
is
of
the
prosecutor
of
an
attorney,
one
in
which
knows
by
the
ethical
rules
should
be
noticing
opposing
counsel
of
motions
that
are
presented
to
the
court.
this
is
exactly
what
is
being
complained
of.
more
so
than
anything
else.
the
harm...
if
this
is
harmless
error,
it
is
still
the
government's
burden
of
proving
this
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
they
have
got
to
prove
that
the
error
did
not
contribute
to
the
verdict
of
taint.
now,
i
don't
see
how
that
could
possibly
in
this
case,
especially
since
this
court
has
before
reviewed
the
testimony
of
dr.
grigson,
and
there's
no
question
about
it
but
for
the
notice
provision,
but
for
the
availability
of
a
defendant
to
have
his
counsel,
at
least
to
talk
to
him
prior
to
such
examination,
he
may
not
have
said
anything
and
there
may
not
have
been
an
examination,
there
may
not
have
been
even
testimony,
and
this
is
one
thing
that
is
just
so
ever-presently
clear.
there
is
continued
repeated
references
made
to
the
dallas
psychiatrist
and
that
he
was
a
medical
doctor
in
the
jury
argument,
and
it's
this
basis
in
which
the
state's
use
of
this
improperly-admitted
evidence
that
the
defendant
was
denied
a
fair
trial,
was
denied
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
it's
on
that
basis,
following
chapman,
upon
the
harmless
error
doctrine,
that
harm
was
made.
harm
was
committed.
i
reserve
my
time.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i'll
be
short.
your
honor,
just
in
response,
the
representations
i
made
are
accurate.
it's
one
of
these
things
that
i
don't
think
in
a
city
the
size
of
san
antonio,
about
the
tenth
largest
in
the
nation
here,
that
the
counsel
here
can
be
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
going
each
and
every
day
to
check
the
court's
jackets,
and
also
with
regard
to
this
practice,
local
practice,
in
texas
or
specifically
san
antonio,
usually
motions
are
noticed
to
opposing
counsel,
and
very
rarely
have
i
seen
otherwise,
and
i
believe
that
the
court
can
take
the
same
posture.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
the
practice
has
been.
now,
i'll
say
since
the
estelle
v.
smith
was
handed
down,
dr.
grigson
has
not
been
used
in
san
antonio.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
it's
usually
a
practice
of
a
motion
and
an
order,
is
what
i've
seen.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i
believe
there
was
a
motion
and
an
order
both
signed
by...
the
motion
was
signed
by
the
prosecutor
and
the
order
was
signed.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
no.
two
separate
documents.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
to
determine
whether
or
not--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--competency
and
future
dangerousness,
and
the
body
of
that
motion
and
order
of
that.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
justice,
that's
correct,
except
in
this
case,
there
was
no
raising
of
the
issue
of
competency
whatsoever
by
the
defendant,
by
his
counsel
being
myself,
or
by
anybody
except
the
prosecutor.
the
state
of
texas,
the
attorneys,
they're
the
only
ones
that
raised
it.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i
know
of
no
such
rule
which
says
that
no
notice
has
to
be
given
to
opposing
counsel.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i
can't
say
that
there
is
a
specific
local
rule
that
says
that,
ma'am,
no.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i
have
read
the
local
rules
before,
but
i
don't
recall
anything
such
as
that.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
well,
certainly
not
that.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
absolutely.
in
fact,
more
specifically
in
a
civil
case,
that
would
be
grounds
for
reversal
of
the
trial
if
it
was
adversely
decided
against
that
party.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
everywhere
i've
practiced
in
the
criminal
courts
and
also
civil
courts,
that
practice
has
always
been
maintained.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
that's
correct.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
the
record--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--yes,
sir.
in
this
case,
the
record
reflects
that
all
of
the
pre-trial
motions
filed
by
the
defendant
did
have
a
certificate
of
service
because
the
joint
appendix
shows
that
the
certificate
of
service
was
omitted
from
printing,
and
the
prosecutor's
motion
and
order,
there
is
no
such
notation
made.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
eight
days.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
i
would
assume
he
did.
now,
there
are
several...
at
that
time,
the
bexar
county
attorney's
office
had
over
fifty
prosecutors.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
that's
basically
it.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
they
let
me
go
my
way.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
the
judge
that
appointed
me
is
the
same
judge
that
signed
the
april
18th
order.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
in
fact,
the
arraignment
was
on
april
13th,
in
which,
of
course,
the
prosecutor
knew
that--
mr.
richard
d.
woods
--there
was
a
representative
on
april
13th.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
d.

i
did
not
receive
a
copy
of
it.
mr.
richard
d.
woods
you
may
be
right.
or
maybe
not
mr.
satterwhite.
counsel
referred
to
buchanan
v.
kentucky
in
his
argument
and
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
that
in
that
case,
the
defense
was
used
of
extreme
emotional
disturbance.
they,
in
fact,
did
join
with
the
prosecution
in
the
motion
for
the
psychiatric
examination.
so,
therefore,
it
could
very
well
be
deemed
proper
to
use
psychiatric
evidence
in
rebuttal
to
a
defensive
issue.
we
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
there
was
no
such
allusion
to
any
psychiatric
evidence
by
the
defendant
because
no
defense
was
raised.
and
with
that,
i'll
close.
thank
you.
