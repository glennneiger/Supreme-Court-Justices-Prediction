justice
scalia
these
nih
reference
numbers
that
we
don't
have,
and
i
understand
you
say
we
don't
need
them,
that
at
this
stage
we
accept
the
allegation
that
they
were
clear
numbers
that
were
clearly
different
from
what
happened
here,
they
are
made
up
by
nih...
made
up...
i
mean
developed.
justice
scalia
and
that
does
take
judgment,
right?
justice
scalia
no,
no,
no.
the
reference
numbers.
justice
scalia
no,
no,
but
i
assume
the
reference
numbers
are
numbers
that
nih
develops
using
its
judgment
as
to
how
high
the
numbers
have
to
be
before
the
product
is
dangerous,
no?
justice
scalia
why
do
they
pick
that
particular
reference
strain?
justice
scalia
they
might
have
picked
another
strain.
justice
scalia
well,
i
assume...
i
mean
these
nih
reference
numbers
come
from
somewhere.
it's
up
to
nih
which
reference
numbers
to
pick.
they
select
a
strain,
or
they
develop
the
numbers.
it
takes
scientific
judgment,
i
gather.
justice
scalia
okay,
now,
you
think
that
there
would
be
one
judgment
in
this
case
if
nih
left
it
to
a
particular
scientist
or
teams
of
scientists
to
both
pick
the
strain
and
therefore
develop
the
nih
number,
and
then
apply
that
to
the
data
from
the
manufacturer,
because
that
would
involve
discretionary
judgment,
right?
but
if
they
divide
it
into
two
steps,
and
they
have
one
team
pick
the
nih
reference
numbers
and
then
have
another
team
say,
take
these
numbers
and
put
it
up
against
what
comes
in
from
the
manufacturer.
that
makes
the
difference
as
to
whether
there
is
liability
on
the
part
of
the
united
states.
justice
scalia
well,
i'm
not
taking
it
all
the
way
up
to
the
top.
i'm
taking
it
to
the
very
close
step
of
the
nih
reference
number
which
they
are
comparing
to
what
comes
in
from
the
manufacturer.
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
congress
embodied
all
of
that
in
the
phrase
"discretionary
function",
and
also
embodied
the
distinction
that
you
urged
upon
us
between...
you
say
it
would
make
a
difference
whether
the
government
here
was
displacing
the
manufacturer
in
the
testing
or
not.
and
all
of
that
congress
chose
to
express
that
by
the
term
"discretionary
function".
justice
scalia
why
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
you
were
displacing
the
manufacturer's
testing
or
not,
whether
you
are
doing
the
testing
yourself
or
displacing
the
manufacturer's
testing?
how
could
that
possibly
made
a
difference
as
to
the
degree
to
which
it's
a
discretionary
function
of
the
federal
agency?
justice
scalia
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
to
me,
but
i
asked
why
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
it's
a
discretionary
function
or
not.
you're
telling
me
why
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
write
a
statute
that
way.
i'm
not
asking
whether
it
would
be
a
good
idea.
i'm
asking
why
that
in
one
case
it's
a
discretionary
function,
and
in
the
other
one
it
isn't.
justice
scalia
mr.
kellogg,
can
i
ask
about
a
possible
narrower
basis
to
get
where
you
want
to
go?
does
all
of
this
case
turn
upon
the
obligation
that
a
product
license
shall
be
issued
only
upon
an
examination
of
the
product,
and
upon
a
determination
that
the
product
complies
with
the
standards?
that's
the
guts
of
it,
right?
it
all
flows
from
that?
justice
scalia
well,
all
right.
justice
scalia
now
that
determination,
we
have
some
of
the
standards
reproduced
here.
are
there
any
other
standards
that
do
involve
a
bit
of
discretion?
i
mean
these
standards
that
i
see
here
don't.
i
mean,
if
it's
just,
you
know,
the
number
of
lesions,
length
of
lesions,
things
like
that,
that's
no
discretion.
are
there
any
other
standards
that
have
to
be
determined,
compliance
with
which
has
to
be
determined
by
the
agency
that
do
involve
some
discretion?
justice
scalia
well,
but
that's
not
a
determination
about
the
product.
i
want
a
determination
that
the
product
complies
with
the
standards.
all
those--
justice
scalia
--i
see.
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
question?
do
you
need
a
separate
product
license
for
a
seed
virus?
justice
scalia
you
don't.
justice
scalia
i
might
agree
with
you,
mr.
kellogg,
this
far,
that
if
an
agency
has
a
determination
to
make
that
involves
some
elements
that
require
a
lot
of
judgment,
but
also
five
elements
that
are
either
they
are
or
they
aren't,
and
they
are
quite
clear,
i
would
still
call
that
probably
a
discretionary
judgment.
but
you
really
haven't
given
me
very
many
examples
of
any
discretion
in
this
at
all.
justice
scalia
is
it
clear
that
you
can't
get
where
you
are
concerned
with
getting,
and
that
is
to
somehow
immunize
the
government's
activity
and
simply
regulating
private
sector
activities,
by
a
defense
on
the
merits?
i
mean
that
is
to
say
the
allegation
here
essentially
is
you
have
been
negligent
in
not
governing.
you
are
suing
the
government
for
not
governing.
that's
quite
different
from
suing
the
government
from
hitting
you
with
a
car.
whether
it's
the
government
or
not,
you
have
a
right
not
to
be
hit
by
a
car.
justice
scalia
but
what's
being
complained
of
here
is
essentially
you
haven't
governed
the
way
you
were
suppose
to.
is
that
merits
defense
still
open
in
the
case?
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
either.
justice
scalia
except
that
it
does
say
discretionary
function
as
the
government
points
out,
and
not
discretionary
act,
and
there
is
some
functions
that
you
would
consider
discretionary
functions
even
though
there
are
elements
within
them
where
you
really
don't
have
much
of
a
choice.
you
have
to
do
it
one
way
or
another.
but
as
a
whole
there
is
so
much
of
an
element
of
discretion
involved
that
you
could
call
it
a
discretionary
function.
isn't
that
a
conceivable
interpretation?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
it
rejected
it?
