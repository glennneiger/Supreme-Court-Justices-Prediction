mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
may
be
helpful,
given
the
questions
during
counsel's
argument,
to
go
through
exactly
what
the
regulations
require
in
this
instance,
and
focus
on
the
specific
allegations
made
by
petitioners.
the
first
thing
that's
done
is
that
a
product
license
is
issued
for
a
vaccine
product.
now
that
vaccine
product
will
use
a
particular
strain
of
poliovirus.
and
according
to
the
regulations,
the
strain
of
poliovirus
must
have
been
tested
on
100,000
susceptible
people
and
shown
to
be
without
harmful
effects.
now
one
of
petitioners'
allegations
appears
to
be
that
the
strain
of
poliovirus
at
issue
here
was
tested
and
found
to
have
been
with
harmful
effects.
our
position
would
be;
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
that
the
phrase
"without
harmful
effect"
embraces
considerable
policy
judgment.
in
fact,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
the
issue
in
this
case
was
considered
by
a
panel
of
scientific
experts
over
a
two-year
period
before
finally--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--yes.
our
position
is
that
it
would
be.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes,
even
though
the
particular
employee
might
have
acted
wrongly
or
negligently.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
even
if
he--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--even
if
he
knew.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
even
though
that
employee
had
a
specific
mandate
as
to
what
his
duty
was
to
be,
because
the
wording
of
the
discretionary
function
exception
focuses
on
functions
of
the
agencies,
not
just
on
duties
of
particular
employees.
the
inquiry
were
under
a
qualified
immunity
case
in
which
the
individual
employee
were
being
sued,
it
might
well
be
appropriate
to
look
at
his
specific
mandate
to
determine
whether
he
violated
that
mandate
with
a
view
to
whether
he
personally
should
be
liable
in
tort.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that
could
pose
a
different
problem.
there
could
be
liability
if
the
government
set
itself
up
to
displace
the
manufacturer
as
the
primary--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--if
it's
doubled,
then
the
primary
responsibility
is
on
the
manufacturer,
and
the
government
is
exercising
its
discretion
to
spot
check
or
to
thoroughly
reject
or
even
to
retest
all
the
results.
but
the
government's
responsibility
is
fundamentally
different
in
regulating
as
opposed
to--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--yes,
because--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
the
issue
was
not
raised
because
there
was
not
an
inspection.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
think
the
court--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--yes,
the
government
did,
and
i
think
the
court
came
very
close
to
accepting
that
position
in
varig
airlines.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
our
position
today
is
that
the
regulatory
functions
of
government,
whether
it
be
writing
the
regulations
or
enforcing
compliance
with
those
regulations,
are
protected
from
suit.
they
are
protected
from
suit
whether
the
agency
elects
to
perform
its
function
by
spot
checking
compliance,
by
rechecking
test
results,
or
by
methodologically
xx
and
duplicating
every
test.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
then
he
is
not
performing
a
regulatory
activity.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
true,
but
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
common
law
torts
of
the
employee's
regulatory
agencies
and
the
peculiar
regulatory
activities
of
inspecting,
licensing
and
certifying.
and
ordinary
car
accident
on
the
way
to
perform
an
inspection
would
not
be
distinguishable
from
an
ordinary
tort
by
an
employee
of
some
other
agency.
it
would
not
impact
upon
the
peculiar
regulatory
functions
at
the
agency.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
think
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
the
court
in
varig
said
quite
clearly
that
the
original
purpose,
the
original
proposals
for
the
discretionary
function
exception
were
to
name
certain
specific
agencies
by
name,
like
the
federal
trade
commission,
or
the
sec,
and
exempt
them
completely.
congress
decided
not
to
do
that
because
as
the
court
in
varig
said,
the
language
of
the
discretionary
function
exception
would
"exempt
from
the
acts
claims
against
federal
agencies
growing
out
of
their
regulatory
activities.
"
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
makes
a
difference
in
several
respects.
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
the
act
was
to
compensate
people
who
would
otherwise
go
uncompensated.
in
the
case
where
you
have
a
primary
actor
in
the
regulatory
context,
the
injured
party
can
look
first,
as
petitioners
did
in
this
case,
to
the
primary
actor.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it's
a
discretionary
function
in
the
sense
that...
well,
take
the
specific
statute
and
regulations
at
issue
here.
they
require
the
agency
to
license
drugs
and
make
a
determination
of
whether
the
drugs
are
safe.
they
do
not
specify
in
any
sense
what
the
standards
are
to
be
applied
by
the
agency
or--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
regulations
in
question
apply
to
the
manufacturer,
justice
o'connor.
the
manufacturer
is
required
to
perform
those
tests.
the
manufacturer
is
required
to
demonstrate
compliance.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct,
but
the--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--but
the
regulations
do
not
require
the
federal
government
to
do
anything
in
respect
to
that
data.
they
do
not
require
the
government...
they
do
not
specify
whether
the
government
is
supposed
to
check,
recheck
the
data
in
detail,
or
redo
the
tests,
or
otherwise
check
up
on
the--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
there
are
three
separate
allegations.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
with
respect
to
the
lot
release,
yes.
the
regulations
do
not
specify
anything
whatsoever--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--then
if
he--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--for
that
particular
employee--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--no,
not
for
that
particular
employee;
for
the
agency
function
in
question
there
is.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
the
agency
does
not
have
to
perform
any
test
or
check
any
data
whatsoever.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
problem
is
with
the
word
"order".
i
mean
in
that
sense,
justice
white,
employees
never
have
discretion
to
be
negligent.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
don't
think
that
follows
at
all.
what
we
are
dealing--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
very
specific
and
limited
situation
in
which
the
primary
burden
of
compliance
is
on
the
manufacturer.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
what
the
court
made
clear
in
dalehite
is
that
abusive
discretion
covers
both
negligence
and
wrongful
acts.
so
the
mere
fact
that
we
have
negligence
or
a
wrongful
act
in
permitting
the
lot
to
be
released
does
not
take
this
case
out
of
the
discretion.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
but
the
language
of
the
exception
is
the
discretionary
function
of
the
agency.
the
regulations
in
question
here
do
not
bind
the
agency
in
any
respect.
we
would
say
that
an
individual
employee
could
be
negligent
or
perform
wrongfully,
and
yet
the
agency
is
still
protected
because
its
essential
function
of
policing
compliance
does
not
change
that.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
is
in
the
sense
that
the
government
has
discretion
whether
to
invoke
its
regulatory
powers
in
this
context
or
not.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that
is
a
regulation.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
not
a
very
specific
one.
it
does
not
say--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--no,
it
would
not
comply
with
the
regulation.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
in
the
extreme
instance
you
are
talking
about
where
he
does
not
look
at
the
paper
at
all,
it
would
definitely
violate
that
regulation.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
because
the
regulation
does
not
specify
what
the
nature
of
the
examination
or
the
determination
of
compliance
has
to
be.
it
does
not
specify
what
to--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--only
on
the
point
of
the
particular
employee.
i
don't
think
that
the
regulations--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--if
the
agency
itself
does
not
comply
with
the
regulations,
the
apa
is
available
to
enforce
compliance,
but
the
ftc
was
not
to--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--pardon?
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
do
want
to
qualify
the
position
we're
taking
in
two
respects
in
arguing
that
the
regulatory
activities
of
agencies
are
protected.
we
are
not
saying,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
that
everything
is
protected.
the
ordinary
torts
of
an
employee
in
a
car
accident
on
the
way
would
not
be
protected.
we
are
limiting
it
to
the
inspection,
licensing
and
certification
activities
as
discussed
by
this
court
in
varig
airlines.
in
varig
the
court
noted
that,
faa
certification
process>
["],
quoting
here
at
467
usc
797,
"is
founded
upon
a
relatively
simple
notion.
"
"the
duty
to
ensure
that
an
aircraft
conforms
to
faa
safety
regulations
lies
with
the
manufacturer
and
operator
while
the
faa
retains
the
responsibility
for
policing
compliance.
"
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct,
there
was
no
action
inspection.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
petitioners
concede
at
page
25,
note
47
of
their
brief
that
if
the
inspection
had
actually
been
conducted
in
varig
airlines,
but
conducted
negligently,
that
it
would
have
been
protected
from
suit,
and
that
seems
clearly
right.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
agency
must
make
a
determination
that
it
complies
with
the
standard,
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
the
guts
of
one
of
their
allegations.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
certainly
the
standard
i
was
noting
to
justice
stevens
earlier
about
the
strain
of
poliovirus
used
in
the
vaccine
has
to
be
determined
to
be
free
from
harmful
effect,
and
we
would
say
that
that
involves
considerable
discretion.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
one
of
the
regulatory
requirements
is
that
the
product
must
use
a
strain
that
has
been
found
to
meet
these
requirements.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no.
the
seed
virus,
in
fact
the
seed
virus
in
question
here,
which
petitioners
are
referring
to,
was
first
begun
to
be
used
by
lederle
three
years
after
the
product
was
originally
licensed.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
with
respect
to
the
seed
virus,
for
example,
all
the
requirements
apply
to
the
manufacturer.
the
regulations
are
quite
explicit
that
the
manufacturer
must
perform
certain
tests
and
determine
that
they
comply.
they
don't
impose
any
duties
at
all
on
the
government.
the
same
applies
to
the
lot
release
questions.
there
are
certain
tests--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
agency
did
approve
lederle's
use
of
the
seed
virus.
the
regulations
do
not--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--yes.
specific
lots
of
vaccines
are
made
from
a
particular
seed
virus.
and
before
any
lot
of
vaccine
can
be
released,
additional
tests
have
to
be
performed
by
the
manufacturer
on
each
lot.
and
petitioners
are
claiming
that
some
of
those
tests
were
not
done.
the
regulations
put
the
burden
of
compliance
in
that
respect
on
the
manufacturer,
not
on
the
government.
now
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
adopted
a
position
that
is
really
very
close
to
what
we
were
arguing.
they
ostensibly
rejected
the
broader
proposition
that
all
regulatory
activities
are
protected
from
suit,
but
they
nonetheless
stressed
that
in
undertaking
the
discretionary
function
exception
you
do
not
isolate
one
regulation
and
look
for
whether
that
particular
regulation
has
in
it
mandatory
language
or
not.
you
look
to
the
regulations
as
a
whole
to
determine
whether
the
ultimate
burden
of
compliance
is
on
the
manufacturer
or
on
the
government.
the
court
said
that
in
this
case
after
looking
through
the
regulations,
and
i
am
quoting
here
from
page
20-a
of
the
petitioners'
appendix,
"the
fda
made
a
policy
choice
to
leave
compliance
in
the
first
instance
with
the
manufacturer.
"
that
seems
to
be
the
crucial
point
in
this
case.
that
is
the
manufacturer
who
has
the
primary
duty
of
responsibility
for
compliance.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
regulations
do
not
say
that
in
fact.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
regulations
apply
specifically
to
the
manufacturer.
they
do
not
purport
to
limit
in
any
sense
the
discretion
of
the
surgeon
general
to
release--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
lot
release
regulations,
justice
white,
they
are
printed
in
the
last
page
of
petitioners'
brief,
610.2(a).
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
sa-10,
that's
correct.
it
says
specifically
that
upon
notification
by
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
biologic,
a
manufacturer
shall
not
distribute
a
lot
of
product
until
the
lot
is
released
by
the
director.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
but
it
does
not
limit
in
any
sense
the
discretion
of
the
director
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
issue
such
a
notification,
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
require
that
that
approval
in
any
specific
instance.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
as
a
practical
matter
in
the
area
of
the
oral
poliovirus
vaccine,
the
fda
requires
them
to
bring
every
lot
to
them,
and
the
fda
is
quite
thorough
in
rechecking
test
results,
and
even
performing
some
of
the
tests
itself
to
double
check
the
manufacture.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
our
central
contention
would
be
that
there
is
not
a
sliding
scale
in
this
area
so
that
when
one
agency
elects
to
spot
check
compliance,
another
agency
elects
to
check
compliance
thoroughly,
and
a
third
elects
actually
to
redo
test
results
itself.
yet
the
greater
the
oversight,
the
more
potential
exposure
to
liability
on
the
part
of
the
government.
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons
why
that
would
be
a
very
unfortunate
result.
it
would
on
the
one
hand
reduce
the
manufacturer's
own
incentive
to
be
safe
if
part
of
the
burden
for
compliance
can
be
pushed
off
to
the
government.
for
example,
lederle
laboratories
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
saying
this
is
a
joint
responsibility
as
to
whether
a
product
complies.
that's
precisely
the
attitude
we
do
not
want
manufacturers
to
be
able
to
take.
it
is
their
primary
responsibility
to
comply
in
each
instance
with
the
regulatory
requirements.
and
the
extent
of
oversight
exercised
by
the
government
should
not
take
away
any
of
their
primary
responsibility.
furthermore,
there
should
not
be
a
disincentive
created
to
the
government
as
to
the
extent
of
oversight
its
going
to
conduct,
because
the
government
clearly
has
a
discretionary
choice
here
as
to
the
extent
of
monitoring
compliance
with
the
regulations.
and
if
the
greater
the
monitoring
undertaken
by
the
government,
the
more
the
potential
tort
liability.
that's
a
disincentive
for
the
government
to
engage
in
extensive
oversight.
so,
in
effect,
you
have
a
double
underlining
of
the
entire
purpose
of
a
regulatory
program
which
is
to
require
the
manufacturer
to
comply
with
the
regulatory
requirements.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
there
must
be
tests
performed
by
the
manufacturer.
the
regulations
are
quite
specific
as
to
all
the
tests
that
the
manufacturer--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--they
must
be
submitted
to
the
government,
and
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
examination
of
compliance.
with
respect
to
the
licensing
claim,
the
specific
provision
that
the
agency
claims
we
violated
has
to
do
with
whether
the
strain
involved
was
tested
on
100,000
people
and
shown
to
be
without
harmful
effect.
we
would
contend
that
that
determination
by
the
agency
involves
considerable
policy
judgment.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
not
the
strain
itself,
justice
o'connor,
but
particular
lots
of
vaccines
have
to
be
produced
and
meet
the
requirements.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
before
the
initial
license
can
be
obtained,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
they
are
not
really
so
specific.
there
is
a
number
of
comparative
factors.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
we
do
as
far
as
the
factual
allegations,
but
not
as
far
as
what
the
regulations
state
and
require.
that
we
determine
by
reading
the
particular
regulations
in
issue
here.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
statute
does
not
specify
in
any
sense
what
the
nature
of
the
tests
are
going
to
be,
how
specific
they
have
to
be,
or
how
specific
the
overview
or
review
has
to
be
by
the
agency.
the
statute
at
issue
in
varig
airlines
was
fairly
specific
too.
that
set
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it
says
with
respect...
at
page
19-a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
it
says
that
a
production
certification
can
only
be
issued.
the
secretary
of
transportation
shall
make
such
inspection,
and
may
require
such
tests
as
may
be
necessary
to
ensure
manufacture
of
each
unit
in
conformity
with
the
type
of
certificate
for
which
the
airplane
has
been
issued.
and
the
court
made
it
clear
that
that
gave
the
agency
considerable
discretion
to
decide...
to
institute
a
spot
checking
program
in
which
it
would
place
the
burden
on
the
manufacturer
to
perform
the
initial
test
and
do
a
lot
of
the
checking.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
fda
engages
in
substantially
more
oversight
than
the
faa
did
in
varig
airlines,
that
is
correct.
our
position
would
be
that
that
in
itself
does
not
make
the
discretionary
function
exception
not
apply.
that
certainly
increases
the
opportunities
for
negligence,
or
for
wrongful
acts.
but
the
discretionary
function
exception
applies
whether
or
not
the
discretion
has
been
abused
in
that
way.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i'm
not
quite
sure
under
what
provision
you
would
be
saying
that
we
raised
that
defense.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
we
would
say
that
those
considerations
are
embodied
in
the
discretionary
function
exception.
