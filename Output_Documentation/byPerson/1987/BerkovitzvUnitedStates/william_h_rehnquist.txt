chief

william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
viakley,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
viakley,
where
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
do
we
find...
i
know
that
section
262
is
set
forth
on
page
41(a)
of
your
petition.
section
601.20
is
set
forth
there.
but
you
have
referred
to
several
other
regulations.
where
do
we
find
them
either
in
your
brief
or
in
your
petition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
if
they
didn't
qualify
under
those
specific
standards,
there
was
a
nondiscretionary
duty
just
not
to
license.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
are
a
number
of
subheads.
can
you
pick
out
any
particular
subhead
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
can
you
tell
from
(iii),
the
subhead,
what
reference
numbers
we're
talking
about
unless
it's
the
80
percent,
because
that
subsection
doesn't
seem
to
have
any
numbers
in
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
were
referring
a
moment
ago
on
pages
sa-7
through
9,
to
73.114(b)(i)
and
under
that
(iii).
chief
justice
rehnquist
determination
of
neurovirulence.
and
then
you
are
talking
about
things
not
matching
the
numbers,
but
i
don't
see
any
numbers
in
section
(iii)
except
for
the
80
percent.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
where
is
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
haven't
put
them
in
your
brief
or
in
your
petition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--i
would
have
found
it
helpful,
in
view
that
we
are
supposed
to
be
deciding
whether
this
is
or
is
not
a
possibly
discretionary
function,
to
have
the
thing
taken
one
more
step
down
the
line.
chief
justice
rehnquist
to
see
what
the
effect
of
these
numbers
that
you
allege
would
have
been
filtered
into
sub
(iii).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
viakley.
mr.
kellogg,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
there
was
no
discretion
in
that
particular
employee?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
exemption
here
is
not
for
negligence;
it's
for
discretion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
no,
and
you
have
to
have
negligence
to
establish
liability
under
the
tort
claims
act.
then
there
is
an
exception
for
discretion.
and
if
the
act
charged
is
negligent,
that
does
not
mean
they
are
liable
if
you
can
show
that
it
was
also
discretionary.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
have
got
to
show
that
it
was
not
only
negligent,
but
that
it
was
discretionary.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
may
be
a
defense
on
the
merits
that
the
agency...
nobody
in
the
agency
had
a
duty
to
do
anything
which
may
be
a
defense
on
the
merits
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
charge.
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it's
a
ground
for
invoking
the
discretionary
exemption.
chief
justice
rehnquist
sa-10?
chief
justice
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
does
this
thing
work
in
practice?
the
manufacturer
gets
these
lots
ready
for
release.
and
can
he
just
decide
i've
passed
the
test,
so
i
am
going
to
release
them,
or
does
he
have
to
come
to
the
fda
or
whatever
it
is
and
say,
okay,
i'm
about
to
release
these?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
then
it
determines
whether
the
manufacturer
has
adequately
performed
the
tests,
or
whether
the
stuff
complies
with
the
regulations,
or
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
two
statutes
may
look
alike,
but
when
you
get
down
to
the
regulations,
the
fda
performed
a
lot
differently
than
the
faa
in
varig.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kellogg.
ms.
viakley,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
viakley.
the
case
is
submitted.
