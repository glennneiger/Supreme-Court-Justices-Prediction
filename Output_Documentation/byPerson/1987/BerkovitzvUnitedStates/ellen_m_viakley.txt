ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
which
embodies
congress's
broad
waiver
of
governmental
immunity
and
consent
to
suit
for
the
tortuous
conduct
of
government
employees.
the
conduct
complained
of
here
is
negligent
execution
of
section
262(d)
of
the
public
health
service
act
and
following
regulations
which
govern
the
licensing
and
release
of
live
poliovirus
vaccines.
the
issue
presented
involves
the
applicability
of
section
2680(a)
of
the
tort
claims
act
which
sets
forth
an
exception
to
the
waiver
of
immunity
to
the
conduct
at
issue.
the
immunity
preserved
by
2680(a)
is
underpinned
by
separation
of
powers
principles.
it
is
intended
to
prevent
the
judiciary,
through
the
medium
of
an
action
in
tort,
from
second
guessing
the
reasonableness
of
executive
policy
judgments.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
what
is
protected
by
2680(a)
is
executive
prerogative;
decisionmaking
grounded
in
social,
economic
and
political
policy.
congress
used
two
clauses
to
accomplish
its
purpose
of
2680(a).
the
first
recognizes
that
conduct
which
obediently
executes
policy
embodies
that
policy,
is
the
policy
made
manifest.
a
challenge
to
such
conduct
is
an
attack
on
the
policy
itself.
the
first
clause,
therefore,
protects
conduct
in
execution
of
a
statute
or
regulation
provided
due
care
is
exercise.
now
under
the
first
clause,
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
conduct
itself
is
discretionary
or
nondiscretionary
so
long
as
it
represents
faithful
execution
of
the
regulatory
plan.
the
second
clause
in
section
2680(a)
protects
discretionary
conduct,
the
exercise
of
discretionary
authority.
now
whether
the
conduct
here
warrants
the
protection
of
the
second
clause,
since
it
has
forfeited
any
claim
to
immunity
under
the
first
clause,
requires
examination
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations
which
give
this
agency
its
power
to
act.
the
powers
and
duties
of
the
agency
with
respect
to
licensing
biologic
products,
including
live
virus
vaccines,
were
defined
by
congress
in
section
262(d)
of
the
public
health
service
act
which
directs
that
licenses
may
be
issued
only
upon
a
showing
that
the
product
meets
regulatory
standards.
the
statute
provides
no
exemptions
to
the
requirements
of
regulatory
compliance,
and
it
does
not
authorize
the
agency
to
act
according
to
its
judgment
of
the
best
course
in
deciding
whether
compliance
is
necessary.
the
agency's
regulations
reflect
that
statutory
mandate
in
providing
that
licenses
may
be
issued
only
upon
examination
of
the
product
and
upon
demonstrated
regulatory
compliance.
the
regulatory
standards
particularly
applicable
to
live
poliovirus
vaccines
are
specifically
charted
in
42
cfr
73.110.
they
cover
three
characteristics
of
the
vaccines:
safety,
potency
and
antigenicity,
each
of
which
is
reduced
to
a
numerical
value.
for
example,
under
73.115,
the
data
must
demonstrate
that
the
concentration
of
live
virus
particles
in
the
vaccine
is
between
200,000
and
500,000
tcid
per
dose.
under
73.117,
antigenicity,
there
are
specific
pre
and
post-treatment
ratios
of
type-specific
antibodies
that
must
be
demonstrated
before
the
vaccine
is
in
compliance
with
that
standard.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
no,
i
would
not,
because
we
have
alleged
that
the
strain
in
fact
paralyzed
people
in
the
test
studies.
that
does
raise
one
point,
though,
because
there
is
some
contention
in
the
briefs
about
exactly
what
is
licensed
under
this
statute:
is
it
the
strain,
is
it
a
seed
virus,
is
it
a
vaccine.
now
the
government
has
contended,
and
we
are
willing
to
accept
for
present
purposes,
that
the
license
is
issued
for
the
poliovirus
vaccine.
in
this
instance,
it
was
the
type
iii
sabin,
live
poliovirus
vaccine.
now
under
the
regulation
you
have
mentioned,
73.110,
five
consecutive
monopools
produced
from
that
parent
strain
must
be
tested
and
data
must
be
submitted
showing
that
they
complied
with
the
neurovirulence
criteria.
if
they
do--
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
--by
the
manufacturer.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
and
the
data
then
submitted
to
the
agency
and
reviewed
by
the
agency.
now
if
those
five
monopools
comply,
a
license
is
issued.
but
that
license--
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
--comply
with
the
neurovirulence
criteria
of
73.114.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
no.
73.114
sets
out
the
characteristics
of
the
vaccine
to
actually
produce
disease
rather
than
immunity.
they
cover
four
specific
characteristics.
one,
macaca
monkeys
have
to
be
inoculated
with
specific
amounts
of
the
vaccine,
and
then
sacrificed
at
the
end
of
an
observation
period,
examined
for
the
number
of
polio--
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
--the
tests
are
done
by
the
manufacturer.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
the
manufacturer
generates
the
data
which
is
put
on
the
license
applications
form
and
submitted
to
the
agency.
the
agency's
duty
is
to
review
that
application
to
make
sure
the
numbers
correspond
before
it
issues
the
license.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
the
regulations
are
a
little
convoluted.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
your
honor,
free
of
harmful
effect
appears
in
the
first
part
of
73.110
which
talks
about
the
original
virus
strain.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
according
to--
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
--according
to
the
government,
we're
talking
about
the
vaccine
monopools
themselves.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
we
are,
your
honor.
as
i
was
trying
to
explain
to
justice
stevens--
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
--what
is
necessary
is
for
the
agency
to
review
the
five
original
monopools
that
were
produced
from
that
parent
strain
and
assess
them
for
compliance
with
the
neurovirulence
criteria.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
no,
that's
set
out
in
73,110,
the
section
that
applies
even
in
the
original
virus
strain.
now
when
a
license
is
issued
for
that
vaccine
that's
represented
by
those
monopools,
what
that
amounts
to
is
an
approval
for
the
continued
use
of
the
parent
strain.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
the
critical
allegation
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
qualifying
monopools
exceeded
quantitative
standards
in
the
regulations,
in
73.114.
that's
the
critical
allegation
with
regard
to
the
original
licensing
decision.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
in
the
brief,
your
honor,
they
are
reprinted
in
the
appendix.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
yes.
they
are
referred
to
throughout
the
text
of
the
brief.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
that's
correct,
and
that
arises
both
from
the
statute
and
the
regulations.
again,
if
you
take
a
look
at
73.114,
which
is
the
critical
standard
here,
it's
the
critical
one
that
was
violated
when
the
original
license
was
issued.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
none.
there
is
no
authority
provided
either
by
the
statute
or
the
regulations
to
license
despite
noncompliance.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
there
may
have
been
pure
sheer
negligence,
or
in
the
griffin
case
what
happened,
and
the
proof
that
was
recounted
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
was
that
agency
employees
decided
that
the
neurovirulence
criteria
weren't
really
as
strict
as
the
regulations
made
them
seem,
and
an
agency
employee
decided
to
ascribe
the
difference
to
something
called
biological
variation.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
no,
not
in
these
regulations.
they
pointed
to
nothing
in
the
regulations
that
confers
policy
judgment
to
license.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
their
theory
for
affirmance
is
basically
asking
this
court
to
provide
what
congress
did
not...
a
broad
per
se
exception
for
regulatory
conduct.
there
is
no
argument
made
in
the
brief
that
would
entitle
this
court
to
conclude
that
the
specific
conduct
at
issue
here
is
discretionary.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
they
have
identified
no
argument
that
this
conduct
is
discretionary,
no
exercise
of
policy
judgment.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
makes
no
difference,
because
there
is
no
authority
to
exercise
policy
judgment
in
making
this
decision.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
i
think
we
should
use
the
word
"product"
because
whether
it's
the
strain
or
the
vaccine
itself
is
a
question
that's
not
clear
from
the
regulations.
there
is
a
licensed
issued
for
the
live
poliovirus
product.
that
license
is
issued
based
on
the
qualifications
of
the
five
original
monopools.
that's
the
first
thing
that
happens.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
that
the
characteristics
of
all
five
consecutive
monopools
comply
with
the
criteria
set
out
in
73.114.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
no,
in
73.110,
the
second
that
refers
to
the
strain,
you
see
that
the
process
goes
all
the
way
down
to
the
monopool
level.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
yes,
it
does,
and
that's
clear
in
73.110.
the
regulation
itself
refers
specifically
to
the
criteria
of
73.114,
and
says
that
five
consecutive
original
qualifying
monopools
must
meet
those
criteria.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
well,
your
honor,
our
understanding,
based
on
documents
reviewed
from
some
of
the
state
court
litigation,
was
that
there
was
government
approval
of
the
seed
virus
which
we
interpreted
to
mean
issuance
of
a
license.
the
government
has
contended
in
its
brief
that
a
formal
license
is
not
issued,
but
admits
that
government
approval
is
required.
now
the
record
does
not
demonstrate
the
nature
of
that
approval.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
we
are
complaining
about
the
initial
approval
of
the
seed
virus,
because
we
have
alleged
that
the
particular
seed
virus
that
produced
the
vaccine
that
paralyzed
this
child
also
demonstrated
excessive
neurovirulence.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
well,
your
honor,
the
third
circuit
didn't
distinguish
among
any
of
the
claims.
it
made
no
distinction
between
the
licensing
lot
release,
made
no
distinctions
at
all
among--
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
--yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
your
honor,
that
is
not
clear
from
the
record
presented.
we
have
alleged
that
it
is
tantamount
to
licensing
decision.
as
we
indicated
in
the
reply
brief,
given
the
contentions
raised
by
the
government,
i
think
that
is
an
issue
on
which
it
might
be
appropriate
to
remand
for
factual
consideration
and
factual
development
of,
number
one,
what
the
nature
of
the
government
approval
was;
and,
number
two,
whether
or
not
the
recertification
requirement
of
the
regs
was
a
mandatory
directive.
and
we
have
indicated
those
facts
we
think
would
be
appropriate
for
development
on
that
issue
in
the
reply
brief.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
we're
saying
that
the
numbers
on
the
license
application
reviewed
by
the
dbs
employee
demonstrated
excessive
neurovirulence;
that
the
numbers
on
the
form
were
higher
than
the
numbers
in
the
nih
reference.
and
under
those
circumstances,
a
red
light
went
on
and
the
agency
had
no
authority
to
proceed;
the
employee
had
no
authority
to
proceed.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
no.

that's
again
a

that's
in
numerical
terms.
it's
expressed

and
that
is

from

again
expressed
in
centimeters;
and
the
number
of

ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
the
manufacturer
generates
this
data,
puts
it
on
a
license
form,
and
the
dbs
employee
has
to
review
the
numbers
to
see
that
they
match
or
do
not
exceed
the
nih
reference
numbers,
and
that's
the
conduct
we're
complaining
of
here.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
that
subsection,
your
honor,
under
subheads
again
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d)
and
(e).
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
right.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
well,
that
section
refers
to
the
nih
reference
strain.
it
incorporates--
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
--it's
not
in
the
regulations.
the
numbers
for
the
nih
reference
aren't
in
the
regulations.
those
are
figures
that
are
maintained
by
the
agency.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
no,
your
honor,
we've
just
alleged
that
the
demonstrated
characteristics
of
this
vaccine
exceeded
the
nih
reference.
we
are
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
all
we
have
are
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
there
has
been
no
discovery
in
the
case.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
no,
you
have
to
accept
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
as
true.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
and
we
have
alleged
that
the
strain
exceeded
the
numbers,
violated
the
regulations.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
we've
alleged
that
it
was
demonstrated
on
the
face
of
the
application.
whether
that
gave
the
employee
actual
knowledge
or
constructive
knowledge
is
irrelevant.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
and
what
step
would
that
be,
your
honor?
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
the
numbers
are
just...
they
are
in
very
small...
for
example,
four
lesions,
a
lesions
that's
two
centimeters
in
diameter,
those
are
the
numbers
we're
talking
bout.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
it's
not
in
the
complaint,
because
the
nih
reference
numbers
are
not
of
record
since
we've
had
no
discovery
in
this
case.
we've
had
discovery
in
state
court
cases
that
led
to
the
basis
for
this
case
being
filed.
what
we
have
alleged
is
that
this
vaccine
violated
and
exceeded
the
numbers
of
the
nih
reference
that
specifically
incorporated
into
the
regulatory
standard
under
subsection
(iii).
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
well,
again
we're
going
back
to
the
question
of
exactly
what
is
licensed.
according
to
the
regulation,
the
product--
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
--no.
he
has
to
have
an
establishment
license.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
an
establishment
license,
but
that's
something
different.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
no,
this
is
a
product
license.
that's
all
that's
at
issue
here.
he
has
to
take
the
original
strain
all
the
way
through
one
complete
process
of
replication
and
produce
a
consumer
level
vaccine,
test
that
vaccine
for
neurovirulence,
demonstrate
its
compliance
before
he
can
qualify
for
a
licence
for
that
product.
that's
the
process.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
no,
it
take
scientific
evaluation.
it
takes
counting
the
number
of
lesions.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
the
reference
numbers
are
the
same
as
those
we're
talking
about
here.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
no,
the
nih
tests
a
reference
strain,
and
the
demonstrated
characteristics
of
that
reference
strain
represent
the
nih
numbers.
they
are
not
numbers
arbitrarily
picked
out
of
a
hat,
but
will
accept
three
lesions
as
being
acceptable.
the
nih
numbers
are
the
demonstrated
characteristics
of
a
particular
reference
poliovirus
strain.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
your
honor,
that's
not
in
the
record.
there
may
have
been
some
exercise--
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
--there
may
have
been
an
exercise
of
judgment
initially,
and
there
was
in
promulgating
these
regulations.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
which
strain
to
pick,
correct.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
your
honor,
that's
the
argument
essentially
made
by
the
government
when
it
says
because
the
agency
had
discretion
initially
at
the
head
of
the
stream
of
activity
to
promulgate
regulations,
that
all
conduct
is
protected.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
you're
taking
it
back
up
the
stream
though.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
and
it
is
true,
of
course,
that
every
activity
undertaken
by
government
is
borne
is
discretion.
if
the
inquiry
ended
there,
if
that
was
the
court's
holding,
the
tort
claims
act
would
be
eviscerated.
there
would
be
no
more
waiver
of
immunity.
there
would
be
no
more
liability.
the
question
here
is
not
where
does
discretion
begin.
the
question
is
where
in
that
stream
of
activity
does
discretion
end;
where
does
the
exercise
of
policy
judgment
stop;
is
the
particular
conduct
at
issue
conduct
which
involves
the
exercise
of
judgment
or
embodies
policy
judgment
by
faithful
execution
of
it.
if
not,
if
it
simply
represents
negligent
execution
of
nondiscretionary
directives,
that's
exactly
the
conduct
that
congress
intended
to
subject
the
government
to
liability
for,
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
and
the
government
is
unable
to
point
to
any
policy
decision
that's
jeopardized
by
this
action.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
well,
again,
your
honor,
in
our
reply
brief
we
indicate
it's
not
clear
on
this
record.
the
regulation
on
its
face
is
not
mandatory.
what
we
have
indicated
in
the
reply
brief
is
that
facts
of
record
in
other
cases
which
we
have
submitted
to
this
court
indicate
that
as
applied
to
live
poliovirus
vaccines,
that
directive
is
mandatory.
but
more
significantly
on
that
issue,
i
think,
is
what
happened
after
the
decision
to
test
was
made.
and,
again,
even
if
that
decision
was
discretionary,
discretion
ended
there
because
the
decision
subsequent
to
that
to
release
the
vaccine
which
was
known
to
be
excessive
neurovirulent
did
not
involve
exercise
of
policy.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
no,
your
honor.
we
indicated
in
our
brief
that
there
was
a
typesetting
error
there,
and
that
the
section
head,
which
is
630.17,
was
omitted.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
that's
correct.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
our
submission
is
that
applies
to
anybody
who
is
in
the
position
of
releasing
the
vaccine.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
again,
our
position
is
that
that...
the
only
sensible
reading
of
the
regulations
is
that
that
standard
applies
to
anybody
who
is
in
the
position
of
issuing
a
release
for
the
vaccine.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
630.17
in
21
cfr.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
briefly
i
would
like
to
address
the
suggestion
that's
been
made
that
if
you
can
find
discretion
anywhere
in
this
regulatory
scheme,
that
you
need
not
look
at
the
specific
allegations
of
misconduct.
that
argument,
that
approach
to
immunity
is
contradicted
by
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
by
its
legislative
history,
and
by
every
case
that
this
court
has
considered
construing
the
statute.
the
second
clause
of
2680(a)
talks
about
the
exercise
of
discretionary
function.
the
legislative
history
which
was
reviewed
and
set
out
by
the
court
in
dalehite
at
note
21,
i
believe
it's
page
29,
talks
about
protection
for
discretionary
acts,
and
for
the
exercise
of
discretionary
authority.
so
you
cannot
look
beyond
our
specific
allegations
of
negligence
here.
it
doesn't
matter
if
in
some
other
part
of
the
regulations
the
agency
may
have
had
discretion
in
making
some
other
kind
of
judgment.
i
think
you
are
bound
to
look
at
our
allegations
of
negligence.
and
to
extend
the
inquiry
beyond
that
again
would
be
to
create
the
equivalent
of
a
per
se
exception,
because
at
some
point
in
every
scheme
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
find
some
discretion.
that's
not
the
test.
the
test
is
whether
or
not
discretion
has
ended
by
the
time
you
get
down
to
the
level
of
conduct
that
the
petitioners
are
complaining
of.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
principled
basis
for
distinguishing
between
a
truck
driver
who
runs
a
red
light
which,
after
all,
is
no
more
than
a
nondiscretionary
directive
not
to
proceed.
this
agency--
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
--the
only
way
it
can
get
there
is
to
provide
a
per
se
exception
for
regulatory
conduct,
and
congress
expressly
did
not
choose
to
do
that.
i
submit
that
the
same
separation
of
powers
principles
that
underlie
2680(a)
and
prevent
the
court
from
second
guessing
the
reasonableness
of
executive
decisions
prevent
this
court
from
second
guessing
the
wisdom
of
legislative
decisions.
congress
did
not
provide
that
exception.
the
court
cannot
go
beyond
the
exception
provided
by
congress.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
i
think
it
did,
your
honor.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
i
think
it
did.
in
2674,
congress
purposefully
adopted
a
state
law
standard
of
tort
liability,
and
the
state
tort
principle
that
underlies
this
action
and
many
fdca
actions
is
the
good
samaritan
doctrine.
now
that
doctrine
the
reporter's
notes
to
restatement
323
cite
a
case
from
pennsylvania
in
1804.
that
doctrine
was
already
in
the
state's
common
law
at
the
time
congress
adopted
a
state
common
law
standard
to
govern
liability
here.
ms.
ellen
m.
viakley
no,
they
did
not
deal
with
regulation
of
vaccines,
your
honor.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
thank
you.
