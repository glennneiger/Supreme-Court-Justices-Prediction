now
the
first
thing
that
happens
is
that
the
strain
is
licensed;
is
that
correct?
is
that
chronologically
the
first
thing
that
happens?
justice
kennedy
and
there
must
be
a
determination
under
73.114
that
the
characteristics
had
been
met?
justice
kennedy
i
thought
the
monopools
didn't
come
until
after
the
strain
had
been
first
manufactured.
justice
kennedy
no,
i'm
talking
about
just
licensing,
manufacture
of
the
strain,
does
73.114
apply
before
that
license
can
be
granted?
justice
kennedy
but
the
regulations
make
that
distinction,
don't
they?
justice
kennedy
can
the
vaccine
be
produced
before
this
strain
is
licensed?
justice
kennedy
does
a
manufacturer
have
to
have
any
license
before
he
produced
the
vaccine
in
his
own
laboratory?
justice
kennedy
has
to
have
a?
justice
kennedy
but
that's
not
an
issue
here.
justice
kennedy
counsel,
could
we
take
a
look
at
the
last
page
of
your
brief,
sa-10,
regulation
610.2(a)?
this
permits
the
director
to
require
that
certain
samples
or
results
be
sent
to
the
bureau;
is
that
correct?
justice
kennedy
is
that
mandatory
or
discretionary?
justice
kennedy
now,
is
that
(b),
which
is
under
(a)?
justice
kennedy
so
(b)
is
a
different
numerical
heading,
is
it
not?
justice
kennedy
and
that
applies
to
the
manufacturer,
not
to
the
government.
justice
kennedy
(b)
says
that
no
lot
shall
be
released,
but
it
applies
only
to
the
manufacturer,
does
it
not?
justice
kennedy
and
what
is
the
correct
numerical
reference
for
(b)?
justice
kennedy
630.17.
justice
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
kennedy
that
is
not
true
though...
what
you
say
is
really,
it
seems
to
me,
relevant
to
the
lot
release
by
the
manufacturer,
but
not
to
the
issuance
of
the
initial
license,
because
there
must
be
a
test
before
the
license
can
be
issued,
and
there
must
be
an
examination
by
the
government.
justice
kennedy
and
those
tests
must
be
reviewed
by
the
government.
