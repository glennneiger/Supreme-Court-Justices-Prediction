justice
o'connor
isn't
that
what
we're
talking
about?
justice
o'connor
well,
you're
the
petitioner,
and
i
thought
you
were
complaining
about
the
original
sabin
strain.
justice
o'connor
and
on
that
is
it
necessary
that
the
agency
determine
that
it's
without
harmful
effect?
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
later
on.
justice
o'connor
well,
can't
the
agency
say
that
something
is
without
harmful
effect
even
though
it
causes
let's
say
one
case
of
polio
in
a
hundred
thousand?
justice
o'connor
was
there
a
separate
license
granted
for
the
seed
virus?
justice
o'connor
what
agency
action
with
respect
to
the
seed
virus
are
you
complaining
about?
justice
o'connor
now
according
to
the
third
circuit,
i
believe,
your
claim
relating
to
the
approval
of
the
seed
virus,
and
your
claim
relating
to
release
of
the
lot
of
vaccine
were
the
same
issue.
justice
o'connor
is
the
seed
virus
approved
in
some
way
other
than
by
approval
of
the
lot
of
vaccine?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
the
government
argued
the
position
you
are
arguing
today.
and
do
you
think
the
court
accepted
that
argument
in
varig?
justice
o'connor
and
didn't
the
government
take
the
same
position
you
are
taking
today
essentially?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
language
just
doesn't
quite
say
what
you
are
arguing
for
today,
does
it,
of
our
opinion?
justice
o'connor
where
does
it
break
down?
what
about
the
employee
of
the
regulatory
agency
who
is
negligently
driving
his
automobile
to
do
the
inspection?
justice
o'connor
well,
he
is.
he's
going
out
to
perform
the
inspection
and
od
the
job
the
regulatory
agency
has
asked
him
to
do.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
kellogg,
that's
not
quite
fair,
because
your
opponents
refers
us
to
section
73.114,
tests
for
safety
and
the
neurovirulence
standards,
and
says
they
are
very
specific
and
require
numerical
calculations
that
can
easily
be
determined
mechanically,
and
that
the
complaint
alleges
a
failure
to
meet
the
standards,
the
mechanical
standards.
justice
o'connor
and
to
submit
the
results
of
the
test
to
the
federal
government
for
its
license,
right?
justice
o'connor
and
the
allegation
is
that
the
numbers
didn't
add
up.
justice
o'connor
well,
did
the
agency
approve
the
seed
virus,
mr.
kellogg?
justice
o'connor
and
was
that
different
from
the
lot
release?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
petitioner
says
that
the
original
license
has
to
meet...
the
strain
has
to
meet
the
test
for
safety
in
73.114.
justice
o'connor
before
the
initial
license
can
be
granted.
justice
o'connor
and
they
say
that
those
tests
are
very
specific
in
terms
of
the
numerical
comparisons.
justice
o'connor
but
we
take
the
complaint
as
it's
drafted,
don't
we?
justice
o'connor
well,
section
262
says
that
the
license
has
to
meet
standards
prescribed
in
regulations
showing
they
meet
such
standards,
and
they
say
that
114
is
the
regulation.
