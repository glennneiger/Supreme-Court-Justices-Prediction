justice
white
as
judge
higginbotham
said.
justice
white
you
said
there
isn't
any
room
anywhere
for
somebody
who
knows
that
the
batch
or
lot
doesn't
comply
with
those
specific
standards,
there
is
no
room
to
nevertheless
go
ahead
with
it.
justice
white
well,
what's
your
theory
about
how
it
did
happen
then?
do
you
think
there
was
just
pure
sheer
negligence,
or
that--
justice
white
--well,
doesn't
the
agency
say
there
is
some
kind
of
discretion
here?
justice
white
what's
their
theory
for
affirmance?
justice
white
they
don't
claim
that
there
was
any
room
for
discretion
either.
justice
white
so
whether
this
was
a
deliberate
ignoring
of
the...
whether
this
was
a
deliberate
act,
or
a
negligent
act,
they
say
it
makes
no
difference.
justice
white
is
there
any
issue
that
we
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
strain
or
whatever
you
call
it
complied
with
the
numbers?
justice
white
yes,
exactly.
justice
white
and
you
also
allege
that
the
people
who
reviewed
the
tests
knew
that
they
didn't--
justice
white
is
this
all
alleged
in
your
complaint?
justice
white
or
even
if
he
just
knew--
justice
white
--specifically
that
this
did
not
comply?
justice
white
--do
you
think
varig
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
if
there
had
been
an
inspection,
and
the
employee
knew
that
there
was
something
wrong?
justice
white
well,
that
certainly
isn't
what
the
case
said.
justice
white
you
mean
any
time
they
file
a
piece
of
paper
the
government
need
not
look
at
it
at
all.
it
just
may
issue
whatever
that
is.
what
is
it
you
call
it,
a
license?
no,
what
do
you
do
if
you
want
to--
justice
white
--you
are
going
to
free
it
for
distribution.
what
are
you
going
to
do?
justice
white
now
suppose
this
lot
is
presented
to
the
agency
and
the
agency
looks
at
the
piece
of
paper,
and
knows
exactly...
the
person
looking
at
it
knows
exactly
what
that
lot
is
about,
and
knows
that
it
doesn't
comply.
justice
white
and
do
you
think
at
that
point
there
is
some
discretion
involved?
justice
white
yes
or
no.
justice
white
no,
but
the
agency
function
is
not
to
issue
that
release
if
those
numbers
don't
add
up.
what
discretion
does
the
agency
have
in
issuing
that
release?
justice
white
i
don't
care.
i
didn't
ask
that.
but
there
it
is,
the
numbers
are
filed
with
the
agency.
all
it
has
to
do
is
look
at
it
and
they
will
know
that
it
does
not
comply.
and
the
order
is
don't
issue
the
release
if
those
numbers
don't
add
up.
now
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
there
is
any
discretion
whatsoever
in
that
situation.
justice
white
well
if
you
win,
i
suppose
you
might
as
well
repeal
the
tort
claims
act.
justice
white
but
there
was
no
examination
of
the
product
in
that
case.
justice
white
and
the
agency
had
decided
just
to
have
a
spot
check
system.
justice
white
well,
now,
that's
completely
different
from
this
case.
justice
white
well,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
bound
by
a
concession.
but
that
was
in
a
regime
in
which
inspections
were
not
always
required.
here,
for
the
initial
issuance
of
the
licenses
as
i
understand
it,
the
agency
must
make
this
determination
and
at
some
later
point
they
can
call
in
particular
lots.
but
initially
the
inspection
must
be
made
by
the
agency;
is
that
not
correct?
justice
white
and
in
no
event
shall
a
lot
be
released
unless
so
and
so.
justice
white
no,
it's
awfully
close.
justice
white
i
thought
you
conceded
that
if
they
file
this
piece
of
paper,
this
lot
like
they
were
supposed
to,
and
there
was
no
examination
whatsoever,
there
would
be
liability.
justice
white
on
the
face
of
the
statute?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
that
still
leaves
the
discretionary
function
problem.
they
didn't
deal
with
regulation
of
salk
vaccine
in
1804,
i
take
it.
