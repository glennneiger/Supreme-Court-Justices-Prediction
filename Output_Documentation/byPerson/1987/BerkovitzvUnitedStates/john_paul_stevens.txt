justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
just
to
be
sure
i
have
got
it
clearly
in
mind?
one
of
the
regulations
i
know
says
that
the
strain
must
be
free
of
harmful
effect,
and
then
i
know
there
is
more
particularity.
but
if
it
just
said
free
of
harmful
effect,
would
you
agree
that
was
a
discretionary
judgment?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
tested
by...
tested
by
whom?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
comply
with
what?
justice
stevens
but
isn't
that
the
criteria
that
they
be
free
of
harmful
effect?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
this
is
done
by
the
manufacturer,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
now
are
you
contending
that
there
are
regulations
specifying
numbers...
that
the
information
submitted
by
the
manufacturer
had
numbers
that
clearly
didn't
comply
with
the
required
numbers?
justice
stevens
it's
a
little
hard
for
me
to
follow
parts
of
your...
of
the
way
you
presented
it
in
the
brief.
justice
stevens
see,
the
regulations...
when
i
look
at
the
actual
regulations,
they
seem
to
use
words
like
"free
of
harmful
effect"
and
so
forth,
which
suggests
to
me
a
discretionary
judgment.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
may
i
go
back
for
a
moment
to
73.114(b),
your
position
on
that?
are
you
alleging
that
the
tests
were
not
valid
in
the
sense
that
the
samples
weren't
sufficient
as
they
describe,
or
that
valid
tests
were
conducted
but
they
produced
results
which
failed
the
standard
in
the
regulation?
justice
stevens
so
you
are
not
saying
the
tests
were
invalid.
justice
stevens
but,
rather,
that
valid
tests
were
conducted
which
produced
numbers
that
violated
a
standard
that
is
somewhere
in
this
regulation...
i've
had
difficulty
finding,
frankly.
but
the
standard
that
they
violated
is
where?
justice
stevens
and
where
in
114(b)
is
it?
justice
stevens
and
what
are
the
numbers
that
are
shown
in
that
section
that
were
violated?
justice
stevens
so
that
in
other
words
when
it
talks
about
comparative
evaluation
toward
the
end,
that's
a
evaluation
to
be
made
by
the
manufacturer
making
the
test,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
problem,
and
i
think
justice
scalia
put
his
finger
on
it
and
i
want
to
be
sure
you
address
it.
supposing
we
all
agree
that
that's
a
discretionary
standard
"without
harmful
effect".
but
supposingly
they
then
further
particularize
certain
standards
that
are
reducible
to
numerical
values
that
would
be
a
regulation
saying
if
it
crosses
the
line,
it
shall
be
deemed
to
have
harmful
effects
and
shall
not
be
licensed.
and
assume
that
in
a
very
liberal
reading
of
the
complaint
they
have
said
that
the
test
results,
when
delivered
to
the
agency,
showed
that
they
violated
the
particularized
standard,
but
somebody
failed
to
read
the
thing,
or
said,
i
don't
care,
it's
only
a
slight
deviation
or
something
of
that
kind.
would
that
be
also
covered
by
the
discretionary--
justice
stevens
--even
though
it's
reduced
to
particular
standards?
justice
stevens
taking
it
a
step
further.
you
would
say
then
that
even
if
the
regulations
required
the
tests
to
be
conducted
by
government
personnel,
and
even
if
they
conducted
them
negligently
and
saw
that
the
results
were
wrong
and
went
ahead
and
said,
oh,
the
heck
with
it,
we're
not
worried
about
this,
we'll
go
ahead
and
license
it
anyway,
there
would
be
no
liability.
justice
stevens
no,
they
just
say,
we
want
you
to
do
it,
and
we'll
them
ourselves
also.
we'll
have
a
double
standard.
we'll
do
it--
justice
stevens
what
is
that
right,
mr.
kellogg?
the
statute
says
on
product
license,
section
73.5,
"a
product
license
shall
be
issued
only
upon
examination
of
the
product
and
upon
a
determination
that
the
product
complies
with
the
standards
prescribed
in
the
regulations
in
this
part.
"
is
that
a
statute
or
the
regulation?
i'm
sorry.
justice
stevens
i'm
sorry.
but
certainly
imposes
a
duty
on
the
agency,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
let
me
just...
supposing
they
filed
an
application...
it
says,
"only
upon
examination
of
the
product
and
upon
a
determination.
"
that
it
complied.
they
file
it
and
they
say,
oh,
don't
bother
reading
it.
go
ahead
an
issue
the
license.
they
did
not
make
any
examination
of
the
application
at
all,
or
any
determination
other
than
some
papers
have
been
filed
and
i
will
now
issue
the
license.
would
that
comply
with
the
regulation?
justice
stevens
it
would
violate
a
mandatory
duty
to
make
an
examination,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
why
is
not
looking
at
the
paper
any
different
from
looking
at
it
and
seeing
that
it
doesn't
comply?
justice
stevens
but
if
the
subsidiary
regulations,
and
i
know
there
is
a
lot
of
detail
here
and
they
haven't
had
discovery,
but
taking
the
most
liberal
reading
of
the
complaint
that
they
are
out
there
somewhere
in
the
closet
some
very,
very
detailed
regulations
that
in
effect
say,
unless
it's
9.6.000
or
more,
don't
issue
the
license,
then
wouldn't
you
have
a
mandatory
duty
then?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
enough,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
you
are
not
arguing
that
respondeat
superior
doesn't
apply,
are
you?
justice
stevens
you
are
not
claiming
that
respondeat
superior
doesn't
apply;
these
are
not
government
agents.
justice
stevens
okay.
