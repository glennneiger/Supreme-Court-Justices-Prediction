justice
white
who
do
you
represent?
justice
white
but
surely
the
ordinance
is
not
unconstitutional
with
respect
to
those
groups
of
people...
or
let
us
assume
that
example
of
yours,
i
suppose
that
if
the
landlord
could
collect
the
$400,
it
is
not...
the
ordinance
is
not
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
him?
justice
white
and
it
is
only
those
landlords
with
hardship
tenants?
justice
white
well,
do
we
have,
i
suppose
by...
saying
among
your
association
members
there
are
some
landlords
of
hardship
tenants?
justice
white
but
even
with
respect
to
landlords
with
hardship
tenants,
the
hearing
officer
is
not
obliged
to
reduce
the
rent
below
$400?
justice
white
so
that
how
do
we
know
that
he
ever
would?
justice
white
i
know
that
is
your
position.
it
sort
of
has
to
be,
i
suppose.
justice
white
well,
you
just
answered
to
the
contrary
in
your
example,
if
the
landlord
is
allowed
to
collect
$400,
there
would
be
no
problem.
justice
white
but
even
if
the
landlord
had
a
hardship
tenant,
if
the
hearing
officer
allowed
the
$400,
the
statute
would
not
be
unconstitutionally
applied
to
him.
justice
white
did
you
make
this
very
argument
before
the
california
supreme
court?
justice
white
on
the
"just
compensation"
clause?
justice
white
because
i
do
not...
they
recite
that
you
concede
that
you
do
not
rely
on
confiscatory
rents.
justice
white
is
that
position
in
your
brief
filed
with
the
california
supreme
court?
justice
white
so
they
necessarily
rejected
that
when
they--
justice
white
--even
if
they
did
not
seem
to
in
their
opinion?
justice
white
they
just
talked
about
"equal
protection".
justice
white
but
absent
the
ordinance
the
hearing
officer
would...
the
landlord,
might
be
able
to
charge
what
the
market
might
permit
him
to
charge
a
lot
more
than
the
hearing
officer
would
allow
him
after
passing
all
these
things
through.
justice
white
so
it
keeps
rents
generally
down
below
what
they
would
be
if
there
were
a
free
market?
justice
white
well,
but
certainly
the
ordinance
also
relieves
any
urge
that
the
municipality
might
have
to
subsidize
the
low-income
people?
you
can
certainly
subsidize
these
people.
justice
white
what
you
are
really
saying
is
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
attack
the
ordinance
on
its
face?
justice
white
--did
mr.
pennell
ever
claim
to
have
a
hardship
tenant?
justice
white
so
as
far
as
he
is
concerned,
i
suppose
you
would
have
the
same
argument:
he
is
not
entitled
to
attack
the
ordinance
on
its
face?
justice
white
yes,
but
if
even
a
landlord
with
a
hardship
tenant,
if
the
hearing
officer
in
your
example
you
used
before,
said
a
reasonable
rate
would
normally
be
$400,
and
you
have
a
hardship
tenant,
he
could
still
leave
it
at
$400.
justice
white
and
that
would
be
a
constitutional
application,
you
told
me
before.
justice
white
so
you
cannot
say
that
this
ordinance
is
incapable
of
constitutional
application.
justice
white
yes,
but
i
take
it
your
only
ground
for
saying
that,
i
suppose
is
that
it
is
just
unconstitutional
under
this
ordinance
to
take
wealth
into
consideration.
justice
white
but
just
the
fact
that
that
factor
may
be
taken
into
consideration
invalidates
this
ordinance
on
its
face,
is
that
it?
