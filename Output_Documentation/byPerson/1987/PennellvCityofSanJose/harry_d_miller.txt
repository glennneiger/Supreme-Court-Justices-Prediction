mr.
harry
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
city
of
san
jose
has
enacted
a
unique
provision
that
it
has
added
to
an
otherwise
valid
rent
control
ordinance.
that
provision
raises
the
question
whether
or
not
a
supplier
of
goods
and
services
can
be
required
to
provide
financial
assistance
to
a
consumer
solely
because
of
the
consumer's
ability
to
pay.
this
case
arises
on
appeal
from
the
california
supreme
court
that
reversed
a
decision
of
the
trial
court
and
a
decision
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
that
had
held
that
this
provision
violated
the
"just
compensation"
clause,
the
"equal
protection"
clause,
and
the
"due
process"
clause.
the
california
supreme
court
rejected
those
arguments
and
found
that
the
provision
was
valid
under
all
three
clauses.
the
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court
found
in
effect
that,
"as
long
as
a
rent
control
ordinance
provides
a
fair
and
reasonable
return
to
the
landlord,
that
the
city
has
to
power
to
use
the
excess
funds
for
any
other
public
purpose.
"
our
challenge
in
this
case
is
based
primarily
on
the
"just
compensation"
clause
in
reliance
on
the
rule
announced
by
this
court
in
both
agins
and
in
the
nollan
case.
we
do
not
challenge
the
one
aspect
of
the
nollan
rule;
we
do
not
challenge
that
we
have
been
denied
the
economic
viability
of
the
use
of
our
land.
we
do
challenge
its
provision
under
the
other
part
of
the
nollan
test,
and
that
is
that
this
provision
fails
to
substantially
advance
a
legitimate
state
interest
under
the
reasoning
of
the
nollan
decision,
that
is
to
say,
that
there
is
no
cause
and
effect,
no
nexus
between
any
conduct
by
the
landlord
and
the
hardship
of
the
tenant
or
the
necessity
to
provide
financial
assistance
to
a
tenant.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
there
had
been
a
taking
of
money,
your
honor.
the
way
the
ordinance
works,
if
a
landlord
wants
more
than
the
rent
that
is
otherwise
provided
by
the
mathematical
formulas,
he
then
establishes
in
his
own
mind
what
he
believes
is
a
reasonable
rent,
and
he
can
then
either
petition
the
city
to
approve
that
additional
rent
as
being
reasonable,
or
in
the
alternative,
the
landlord
can
give
a
30-day
notice
to
the
tenant,
establishing
this
higher
rent,
and
then
the
tenant
has
the
opportunity
to
file
a
petition
with
the
city.
in
either
event,
the
hearing
is
held
and
the
hearing
officer
looks
at
various
factors...
the
factors
he
looks
at
are
primarily
the
economic
factors
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
landlord;
his
rent,
his
expenses,
et
cetera...
how
well
he
is
maintaining
the
property,
et
cetera.
based
upon
those
factors,
the
hearing
officer
establishes
what
rent
would
be
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
now
let
me
use
an
example:
assume
after
examining
all
those
factors,
the
hearing
officer
determines
that
a
reasonable
rent
for
this
unit
would
be
$400
a
month.
if
the
tenant...
if
the
unit
is
not
occupied
by
a
hardship
tenant,
then
that
would
be
the
rent
that
the
landlord
could
charge...
the
$400.
however,
if
this
unit
is
occupied
by
a
hardship
tenant,
then
he
can
reduce
the
rent
to
let
us
say,
$375.
it
is
our
position
from
that
reduction
of
the
rent
from
a
reasonable
figure
of
$400
down
to
another
figure
of
$375
is
a
taking
of
the
rent
from
the
landlord.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
the
lack
of
validity
of
this
provision
appears
on
the
face
of
the
ordinance
and
an
application
would
not
do
anything
to
assist
this
court
in
resolving
this
dispute.
the
ordinance
provides
on
its
face
expressly
that
the
hearing
officer
must
consider
the
financial
ability
of
a
tenant
to
pay.
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
a
totally
unconstitutional
standard,
that
they
cannot
look
at
the
tenant's
ability
to
pay.
it
would
be
for
example
as
if
the
ordinance
provided
that
the
hearing
officer
could
consider
the
religion
or
political
affiliation
of
a
tenant.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
we
represent
mr.
richard
pennell
who
is
a
property
owner
of
an
apartment
house
and,
more
importantly,
the
tri-county
apartment
owners
association,
that
is
an
unincorporated
association
of
rental
property
owners.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
correct.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
we
are
the
supplier
of
goods
and
services.
we
supply
units
and
we
supply
them
to
everyone.
we
supply
them
to
both
hardship
and
non-hardship
tenants.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
because
there
is
no
constitutional
way
that
the
hearing
officer
could
even
consider
tenant
hardship.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
there
is
no
way
that
this
can
be
applied
constitutionally.
it
does
not
become
more
or
less
unconstitutional
merely
because
it
is
applied.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
this
ordinance
goes
one
step
further.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
that
is
the
interpretation.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
but
i
think
that
i
can
show
the
court
that
even
though
the
$375
in
my
example
is
an
otherwise...
it
meets
the
constitutional
minimum
rent,
i
believe
i
can
show
this
court
that
the
city
does
not
have
the
power
or
the
authority
to
take
away
from
us
that
increase
that
otherwise
be
determined
to
be
reasonable.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
i
think
you
would
come
out
with
the
same
result,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
for
the
wrong
reason:
the
city
of
san
jose
could
say
that,
"all
you
could
have
is
$375,
and
that
is
a
fair
and
reasonable,
and
it
meets
the
constitutional
minimum.
"
what
they
cannot
do
is
say
you
can
have
more
but
then
take
it
away
from
you
for
the
wrong
reason.
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
nollan
and
this
court
said
you
could
not
do
it.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
yes.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
i
believe
that
would
violate
the
"just
compensation"
clause
under
the
same
reasoning
that
we
presented
here,
your
honor.
the
wealth
of
the
tenant
is
not
a
legitimate
consideration
in
establishing
the
rent.
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
rich
people
can
pay
more
than--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--yes,
your
honor,
we
do
have
income
tax
rates
that
are
based
upon
wealth.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
there
is
a
substantial
difference,
however.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
constitutionally
what
you
have
is
a
charge
that
is
applied
to
everyone
and
is
being
applied
equally.
here
you
have
a
charge
that
is
being
applied
from
one
individual
to
another
individual.
a
single
landlord
is
selected
at
random
and
being
told
that
he
would
have
to
reduce
his
rent
to
his
tenant.
and
i
think
your
question
raises
a
problem
because
this
ordinance
has
been
depicted
in
briefs
and
in
newspapers
as
a
"robin
hood"
type
of
an
ordinance,
taking
from
the
rich
and
giving
to
the
poor,
and
that
is
not
the
effect
of
this
ordinance.
the
average
landlord
owns
less
than
twelve
rental
units.
many
landlords
are
hardworking
people
who
have
invested
their
money
in
small
units
to
provide
for
their
own
security
and
their
own
retirement.
on
the
other
hand,
by
the
statistics
of
hud,
the
median
income
in
san
jose
is
over
$43,000.
a
tenant
becomes
automatically
a
34,000.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
yes,
your
honor,
in
california
we
had
such
an
ordinance.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
this
was
held
invalid
in
the
cunningham
case
under
the
"equal
protection"
clause,
that
a
lawyer
that
was
providing
goods
and
services
to
the
public
cannot
be
required
to
provide
pro
bono
services
in
civil
suits,
and
in
civil
suits
we
have
the
public
defender.
and
for
the
same
reason
i
believe
this
ordinance
falls
under
the
same
province...
has
the
same
problem.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
which
argument?
mr.
harry
d.
miller
yes.
the
"just
compensation"
clause.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
well,
your
honor,
we
made
two
arguments
before
the
california
supreme
court.
the
first
argument
was
that
by
definition,
when
the
hearing
officer
establishes
a
reasonable
rent,
and
then
reduces
it,
we
are
being
denied
the
constitutional
minimum.
the
supreme
court
disagreed
with
us
on
that
and
we
are
not
presenting
that
issue
to
the
court
because
we
know
that
you
will
accept
the
california
court's
interpretation.
but
our
next
position,
which
was
actually
pushed
more
hard,
was
that
even
if
we
are
receiving
the
constitutional
minimum,
that
you
cannot
take
away
the
excess
for
the
wrong
reason.
we
see
no
difference...
if
there
is
a
housing
shortage,
we
agree
that
the
police
power--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--that
we
are...
that
even
if
we
are
receiving
minimum
rent?
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
their
argument
and
their
decision
that,
even
though
there
is
a
fair
and
reasonable
rent--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
well,
they
did
in
that--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--yes,
they
talked
about
"equal
protection".
i
think
you
will
find
a
footnote
on
"due
process",
and
another
provision,
another
passage
where
they
talked
about
"just
compensation".
of
course,
in
defense
of
our
supreme
court,
they
did
not
have
the
nollan
case
in
front
of
them
when
they
made
this
decision,
but
they
did
have
the
agins
rule.
we
did
not,
in
explanation,
your
honor,
present
the
argument
as
clearly
focused,
as
we
are
now
presenting
it
to
this
court.
we
made
the
same
arguments
but
not
as
clearly
focused.
having
thought
about
this
for
such
a
long
period
of
time,
we
boiled
this
case
down
to
a
very
simple
issue:
the
housing
shortage--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
it
definitely
does,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
it
definitely
will.
by
reducing
the
rent
you
reduce
the
value
by
definition.
and
that
tenant
potentially
can
stay
there
until
he
dies,
because
as
long
as
he
does
not
default,
he
has
a
right
to
remain
in
possession.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
yes
ma'am.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
that
is
correct.
except
for
default.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
anti-eviction
provisions
in
the
ordinance
which
we
are
not
attacking,
however
i
think
it
impacts
on
the
effect.
we
can
only
evict
a
tenant...
it
is
worded
somewhat
difficult,
but
somewhat
in
effect
they
can
only
evict
a
tenant
for
a
default.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
it
has
an
aspect
of
physical,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
we
consider
it
as
a
hybrid,
your
honor.
it
is
not
a
pure
regulation
test
as
in
agins
or
macdonald.
and
it
is
not
a
pure,
physical
possession,
as
in
loretto.
rather
it
is
a
hybrid,
as
in
nollan.
nollan
was
a
regulatory
case.
however,
because
the
public
was
given
the
right
to
pass
back
and
forth
on
the
easement,
it
also
has
an
aspect
of
physical
possession.
and
we
have
the
same.
we
admit
that
this
is
a
price
regulation
as
such,
but
the
nollan
test
should
apply
because
it
also
has
the
aspect
of
the
physical
possession.
the
tenant
is
given
this
possessory
life
estate
and,
because
it
affects
possession,
it
is
our
belief
that,
under
the
nollan
standard,
it
is
intermediate
scrutiny
standard,
it
should
also
apply
to
this
case
because
we
have
the
similar
aspect
of
physical
occupation
by
the
tenant.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
i
agree,
your
honor,
but
make
sure
we
define
what
we
are
talking
about.
if
there
is
adequate
justification
that
there
was
a
shortage
of
low-rent
housing,
but
there
was
an
adequate
supply
of
high-rent
housing,
i
see
no
problem
under
the
police
power
for
them
to
rent,
to
regulate,
only
low
rent
housing.
what
they
cannot
do
is
regulate
housing,
the
price
of
housing
based
upon
the
income
of
the
tenant.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
no,
your
honor.
anyone
can
occupy
low
rent
housing,
without
any
basis
of
what
type
of
income
they
earn,
anyone...
if
they
say
"all
units
of
$500
or
less
we
will
regulate.
"
and
there
was
a
shortage
of
such
units,
i
would
have
no
problem
with
that.
but
if
they
say
"we
are
only
going
to
regulate
those
units
for
people
with
certain
income.
"
they
are
now
telling
the
landlord
that
"you
have
to
subsidize
this
tenant
because
of
what
he
earns.
"
mr.
harry
d.
miller
because
you
cannot
regulate...
establish,
price
regulation
based
upon
the
consumer's
ability
to
pay,
your
honor.
let
us
take
for
example
a
grocery
store:
if
a
grocery
store
is
offering
goods
at
a
reasonable
price,
he
has
a
right
to
charge
a
reasonable
price
to
the
consumer,
regardless
of
the
consumer's
ability
to
pay.
we
do
not
tell
the
groceryman
that
he
has
to
reduce
the
price
of
his
milk
because
the
customer
cannot
afford
to
pay.
we
recognize
that
the
ability
to
pay
is
a
public
problem.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
nebbia
line
of
cases.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
the
justification
for
nebbia
v.
bordens,
that
line
of
cases,
your
honor,
gave
a
justification
for
a
general
regulation
just
as
you
have
a
justification
for
a
general
rent
control
ordinance.
what
they
said
in
nebbia
was
that
"we
have
a
problem
of
oversupply
and
this
oversupply
is
causing
destructive
competition.
"
"in
order
to
protect
the
public
we
have
to
maintain
a
minimum
price
so
that
the
supplier
can
maintain
a
minimum
profit.
"
that
was
to
protect
the
public,
just
like
rent
control.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
and
i
would
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
your
honor.
my
reasoning
is
this--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--i
misunderstand
the
question.
i
understood
the--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--yes,
they
can.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
i
misunderstood
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
i
do
believe,
your
honor,
that
because
of
market
conditions
the
grocer
is
able
to
charge...
because
of
market
conditions,
the
groceryman
was
able
to
charge
let
us
say
$1.80
for
his
milk
and
that
was
an
unreasonable
price
because
of
market
conditions,
that
the
state
could
come
in
and
say
"we
will
regulate
all
milk
at
$1.50.
"
what
they
could
not
do
is
say,
"you
can
charge
anyone
in
the
population
$1.50,
but
if
a
customer
comes
in
and
he
cannot
afford
to
pay
$1.50,
you
have
to
lower
your
milk
to
$1.35.
"
"we
have
always
recognized
that
the
assistance
of
our
impoverished
citizens
is
a
public
burden.
"
"we
are
not
saying
that
we
should
not
be
helping
those
who
need
help.
"
"that
is
not
the
question.
"
"the
question
is,
who
is
to
provide
that
assistance?
"
"we
are
suggesting
that
it
is
the
public
burden,
and
they
cannot
select
randomly
different
individuals
to
provide
that
financial
aid.
"
what
we
do,
for
example,
with
the
grocery
store,
is
we
say,
"groceryman,
you
do
not
have
to
reduce
your
rent
below
what
is
reasonable;
we
help
the
impoverished
by
providing
food
stamps.
"
"just
like
we
tell
the
druggist,.
"
and
before
the
san
jose
ordinance
came
along,
what
we
said
was,
"tenant,
if
you
cannot
afford
to
pay
a
reasonable
rent,
a
rent
that
has
already
been
reduced
by
rent
control,
if
you
cannot
afford
to
pay
a
reasonable
rent,
we
will
provide
for
you
a
section
8
subsidy.
"
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
the
city
of
san
jose
is
trying
to
take
a
public
burden
to
those
who
need
assistance
and
try
to
shift
that
burden
onto
the
individual.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
yes,
your
honor,
in
fact,
i
think
there
are
some
rate
regulations
that
have
done
something
similar
to
that.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
the
difference
is
you
are
taking
it
and
applying
it
across
all
the
consumers.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
in
the
rate
cases,
your
honor,
with
either
working
with
a
utility,
which
is
a
monopoly,
or
if
you
are
talking
about
a
gas
rate
case,
which
is
a
near-monopoly,
you
have
a
situation
where
you
do
not
have
normal
market
forces
operating.
the
state
comes
in
and
says,
"we
have
given
you
a
permit
to
operate
a
monopoly
and
there
are
certain
things
we
can
tell
you
to
do.
"
"one
of
the
things
is
we
can
tell
you
what
kind
of
prices
you
can
charge,
and
we
can
tell
you
that
we
are
going
to
require
you
to
reduce
those
charges
to
certain
consumers
and
not
to
others.
"
but
that
charge
is
spread
out
over
everyone.
san
jose
is
not--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--yes,
i
agree,
your
honor,
except
with
the
utility,
one
supplier
is
supplying
thousands
of
people.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
but
keep
in
mind,
your
honor,
this
ordinance
is
not
based
upon
an
ability
to
pay.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
that
is
correct.
i
agree.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
no
it
is
not,
your
honor.
whenever
the
state
gives--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
perfectly--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--that
is
a
distinction,
your
honor.
if
it
was
a
public
utility
where
the
state
is
given
a
monopoly
permit,
you
can
do
one
thing.
but
you
cannot
go
out
to
the
private
entrepreneur
and
do
the
same
thing.
that
is
not
our
economic
system.
it
just
will
not
go.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
no,
your
honor.
rent
control
is
well-established
as
a
valid
exercise
of
the
"police
power".
whenever
there
are
those
circumstances
where
a
housing
shortage
permits
rents
to
go
too
high,
the
state
has
a
right
to
come
in
and
protect
itself.
no,
your
honor,
this
goes
one
step
further.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
yes,
it
is
a
rent-control
ordinance.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
yes,
but
it
is
controlling
it
for
the
wrong
reason
and
on
the
wrong
basis.
the
rest
of
the
ordinance,
justice
marshall,
we
are
not
attacking.
the
rest
of
the
ordinance
that
looks
into
what
is
a
reasonable
rent
for
the
landlord
we
have
no
problem
with.
if
they
did
not
add
this
one
provision
that
says,
"landlord,
you
have
to
reduce
your
rent
merely
because
this
one
tenant
cannot
afford
to
pay.
"
that
is
our
challenge.
this
is
a
very
important
question:
it
is
important
because
there
are
over
200
jurisdictions
in
this
country
that
have
rent
control
ordinances
and
if
the
california
decision
is
allowed
to
stand,
you
can
be
sure
that
they
are
going
to
follow.
but
more
importantly,
in
california--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--and
it
will,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
all
right,
your
honor,
the
next
step
is
in
california,
every
rent
control
ordinance
that
i
am
aware
of...
and
there
are
between
40
and
50,
all
provide
that
the
hearing
officer
can
take
into
consideration
"any
relevant
factor".
and
if
this
california
supreme
court
opinion
stands,
then
those
jurisdictions,
which
i
think
is
about
all,
then
the
hearing
officer
can
thereafter
take
into
consideration
the
tenant's
ability
to
pay,
and
more
importantly,
we
will
not
even
know
it,
because
we
do
not
know
what
goes
through
the
hearing
officer's
mind
necessarily
in
establishing
this
rent.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
we
hope
not,
but
one
last
point,
if
the
court
please:
we
are
not
only
challenging
this
ordinance
under
the
"just
compensation"
clause,
but
also
under
the
"equal
protection"
clause.
we
find
no
difference
in
this
case
between
that
and
the
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
in
webb's
pharmacy.
in
webb's
pharmacy
the
interpleaded
funds
were
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court.
the
clerk
did
not
have
to
put
those
into
an
interest-bearing
account.
so
that
there
was
no
requirement
or
constitutional
right
for
the
depositor
to
have
interest.
but
then
the
state
said,
"when
you
put
it
into
an
interest-bearing
account,
we
can
take
the
interest
and
use
it
for
a
public
purpose.
"
and
we
say
that
is
the
same
thing
they
are
doing
here
in
san
jose.
they
do
not
have
to
give
us
the
higher
rent.
what
they
cannot
do
is
allow
the
higher
rent
and
then
take
it
for
a
public
purpose,
the
public
purpose
being
to
support
the
underprivileged.
i
think
the
same
philosophy
would
follow
from
your
decision
in
marino,
which
was
another
"equal
protection"
where
food
stamps
were
denied
to
persons
who
were
living
to
another
unrelated
person.
there
is
no...
this
court
held
that
there
is
no
correlation
between
the
taking,
the
fact
that
they
were
unrelated
persons,
and
food
stamps.
and
although
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
food
stamps,
you
cannot
give
them
and
then
take
them
away
for
the
wrong
reason.
and
that
is
substantially
our
argument.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
make
it
short.
i
think
i
would
like
to
address
justice
white's
question
on
the
facial
challenge,
as
i
can
see
his
concern:
i
see
no
distinction
on
a
facial
challenge
where
the
challenge
is
under
the
"equal
protection"
or
under
"just
compensation".
the
question
is
whether
or
not
on
its
fact
there
is
any
possible
way
for
this
standard
to
be
applied
in
a
constitutional
manner.
if
we
assume
for
a
moment--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--yes,
your
honor.
we
represent
over
half
of
the
residential
rental
units
in
the
city
of
san
jose.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
we
allege
that
we
have...
represent
owners
who
are
subject
to
the
ordinance.
as
i
say,
we
represent
most
of
the
residential
unit
owners
in
the
city
and
we
have
many
hardship
tenants.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
of
all
the
hardship
tenants
in
the
city
of
san
jose,
we
necessarily
have
many
of
them
since
we
are
the
suppliers
of
housing
in
the
city
of
san
jose.
so
necessarily
if
they
are
going
to
live
somewhere,
they
have
to
live
in
our
units.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
it
is
if
he
is
ever
at
any
time
going
to
consider
the
hardship
of
the
tenant
in
making
his
decision.
what,
if
you
leave
this
decision
stand,
your
honor,
you
are
saying
is
that
there
is
an
unconstitutional
law
that
is
never
going
to
be
applied.
the
only
way
that
we
can
stop
this
from
ever
being
applied
unconstitutionally
is
to
remove
it
from
the
order.
that
is
the
only
possible
way.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
correct.
poverty.
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
harry
d.
miller
it
may
not,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that.
however,
there
is
no
possible
way
they
could
even
consider
the
factor
and
why
should
this
court
leave
an
unconstitutional--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--not
unless
you
say
the
hearing
officer...
just
the
fact
that
the
hearing
officer
could--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--could
have
took
wealth
into
consideration
and
it
did
not
make
any
difference
to
him.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
the
problem
is
that
there
have
been
many
times
that
we
may
not
even
know,
your
honor.
can
i
use
an
analogy?
let
us--
mr.
harry
d.
miller
--if
they
are
sub
rosa
applying
the
standard,
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
harry
d.
miller
without
this
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court,
it
would
not
be
anything
invalid
on
its
face.
it
is
only
when
the
ordinance
expressly
says
that
this
they
must
do.
they
are
required
to
consider
the
hardship.
