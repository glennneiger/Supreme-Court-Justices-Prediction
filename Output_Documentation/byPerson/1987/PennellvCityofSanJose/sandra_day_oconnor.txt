he
cannot
be
evicted?
justice
o'connor
notwithstanding
the
existence
of
a
leasehold
period
that
has
expired?
justice
o'connor
are
you
arguing,
then,
this
is
like
a
physical
taking
or
is
it
a
regulatory
taking?
justice
o'connor
well,
which
is
it?
how
do
we
know?
justice
o'connor
but
you
take
the
position
that
it
is
perfectly
valid
for
the
city
to
require
a
landlord
with
let
us
say
ten
units
to
perhaps
be
asked
to
allow
a
particular
income,
a
low-income
tenant,
to
remain
indefinitely
in
the
premises
at
a
rent
which
is
lower
than
the
reasonable
rent
that
has
been
allowed
for
other
tenants
generally
in
the
same
building,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
but
it
could
work
that
way?
justice
o'connor
at
the
end
of
a
term
he
cannot
and
might
have
to
keep
this
person
indefinitely
who
happens
to
be
a
hardship
tenant?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
does
seem
to
be
requiring
the
landlord
to
assume
a
public
burden,
does
it
not?
justice
o'connor
could
the
city
require
grocers
to
sell
to
hardship
people
at
a
lower
price
than
to
others?
justice
o'connor
but
do
we
have
anybody
in
front
of
us
who
is
a
landlord
of
property
with
a
hardship
tenant
who
would
benefit
from
this
statute?
justice
o'connor
well,
there
are
no
allegations
that
i
have
seen
that
say,
"we
have
hardship
tenants
and
we
are
affected
by
this
statute.
"
justice
o'connor
being
"generally
subject
to
it"
is
not
the
same
as
"having
units
with
hardship
tenants",
though,
is
it?
because
absent
that
there
would
be
no
application
of
the
statute?
the
ordinance?
