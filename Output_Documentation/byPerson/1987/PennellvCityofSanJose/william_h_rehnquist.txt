we
will
hear
argument.
first
this
morning
no.
86-753,
richard
pennell
v.
city
of
san
jose.
mr.
miller,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
not
some
problem
with
the
"just
compensation"
clause
applying
at
all
to
this
case?
there
really
has
been
no
taking,
certainly
in
any
physical
sense,
of
your
property.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
is
a
very
hypothetical
situation.
you
are
just
attacking
the
ordinance
on
its
face,
are
you
not?
you
do
not
have
any
particular
fact
situation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
guarantee
that
that
is
how
a
hearing
officer
would
handle
that
sort
of
an
inquiry?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
in
answering
one
of
your
contentions,
said
that
the
"city
of
san
jose
could
elect
to
regulate
only
landlords
with
hardship
tenants.
"
and
thereby
achieve
the
same
results.
do
you
disagree
with
that
statement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
would
that
not
be
very
much
what
they
were
doing
if
they
regulated
only
low
rent
housing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
is
one
permissible
and
another
not
in
your
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
can
tell
the
grocer
that
he
has
to
raise
the
price
of
his
milk
above
what
he
wants
to
charge?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you
could
require
him
to
raise
it,
why
can
you
not
require
him
to
lower
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
if
the
legislature,
the
city
council,
says,
"we
have
a
problem
of
starvation:
there
are
a
lot
of
people
that
cannot
afford
to
buy
milk....
"
you
know,
there
you
are
talking
about
eight
cents...
but
now
let
us
say
$1.80
or
something?
"so
we
are
going
to
say
that
you
have
to
sell
it
at
$1.60.
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
am
not
so
sure
you
did.
i
think
maybe
justice
scalia
has
qualified
it.

thank
you,
mr.

we

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
very
much,
ms.
gallo.
mr.
miller,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
the
consideration
of
poverty
never
leads
to
anyone's
rent
being
changed
in
a
particular
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
suppose...
that
you
came
up
to
this
court
with
a
tactical
case
that
had
happened.
the
hearing
officer
says,
"landlord
a
has
no
hardship
tenant.
"
"he
gets
$400.
"
"landlord
b,
same
identical
property,
hardship
tenant,
but
i
am
going
to
give
him
$400
too?
"
nothing
wrong...
nothing
anybody
can
do
about
that
to
say
it
is
unconstitutional,
is
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
passes
through
his
mind?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
four
cases
and
the
first
no.
86-753,
pennell
against
the
city
of
san
jose.
it
involves
a
challenge
to
a
rent
control
ordinance
enacted
by
the
city
of
san
jose,
california
that
allows
a
hearing
officer
to
consider
among
other
factors
the
hardship
to
a
tenant
when
determining
whether
to
approve
a
rent
increase
proposed
by
a
landlord.
the
suit
came
up
to
a
california
state
court,
which
upheld
the
ordinance.
as
a
preliminary
matter
we
conclude
that
appellants
have
standing
to
pursue
this
appeal.
the
appellants
are
the
landlords
in
san
jose.
on
the
merits,
we
first
conclude
that
it
is
premature
to
address
the
landlord's
claim
at
the
application
of
the
ordinance
tenant
hardship
provisions
constitute
a
taking
of
private
property
without
just
compensation.
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
tenant
hardship
provisions
have
ever
been
relied
on
to
reduce
an
otherwise
reasonable
rent
increase,
and
the
ordinance
itself,
does
not
require
that
an
increase
be
so
reduced,
and
so
this
does
not
present
the
case
in
the
concrete
factual
setting
that
we
ordinarily
require
to
decide
it.
for
the
reason
stated
in
our
opinion,
we
do
conclude,
however,
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
hearing
officer
may
consider
the
hardship
of
the
tenant
in
fixing
a
reasonable
rent
does
not
render
the
ordinance
facially
invalid
under
either
the
due
process
clause
or
the
equal
protection
clause.
so
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
is
affirmed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
on
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
o'connor
has
joined.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part.
