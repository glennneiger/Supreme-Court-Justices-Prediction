justice
scalia
mr.
miller,
before
you
go
on,
just
one
more
question
on
the
standing:
is
it
the
case
that
a
landlord
who
has
a
hardship
tenant
and
wants
to
sell
his
property,
the
purchaser
from
him
would
be
subject
to
the
same
ability
of
the
california
authorities
to
require
the
charging
of
a
lower
rent?
justice
scalia
he
does
not
sell
out
from
under
that
provision?
justice
scalia
so
the
asserted
authority
by
the
state
of
california
does
amount
to
in
effect
a
sort
of
cloud
on
his
title
to
the
premises?
justice
scalia
it
is
an
asserted
ability
of
california
to
require
that
those
premises,
at
least
as
long
as
this
occupant
is
in
them,
will
bring
less
income?
justice
scalia
and
might
that
affect
the
sale
price
that
an
individual
is
able
to
get
for
a
unit
that
has
a
hardship
tenant?
justice
scalia
and
that
cloud
is
effective
whether
or
not
you
know
in
advance
whether
in
fact
the
hearing
officer
will
reduce
it?
the
mere
risk
of
his
reducing
it
makes
that
unit
less
valuable.
you
mean
if
a
unit
is
leased
for
a
term
of
years
that
the
tenant
can
hold
over
indefinitely
at
the
lower
rent
by
virtue
of
this
law?
justice
scalia
no,
you
would
not.
you
would
not
say
that
if
they
did
it
for
everybody,
would
you?
justice
scalia
i
understood
your
position
to
be
that
the
state
could
not
require
a
lower
price
across
the
board.
justice
scalia
not
conditional
upon
what
the
economic
status
of
the
particular
purchaser
is.
justice
scalia
mr.
miller,
you
can
make
a
utility
give
its
services
for
free,
can
you
not?
a
regulated
public
utility?
in
fact,
many
of
them
do.
cable
systems
provide
their
services
for
free
to
municipalities
and
are
required
to.
justice
scalia
but
that
would
be
a
"taking"
for
a
private
person
would
it
not,
to
require
it
give
it
away
for
free?
justice
scalia
how
do
you
know
you
can
be
sure?
it
may
not
be
a
fairly
wise
ordinance
because
it
may
discourage
the
rental
of
units
to
low
income
people.
justice
scalia
so
i
am
not
sure
you
are
right
there
and
people
will
follow
it
for
that
reason.
justice
scalia
you
are
just
saying
they
may
be
doing
it
already?
justice
scalia
ms.
gallo,
what
about
seeing
this
problem
of
the
hardship
tenants
and
to
meet
that
same
problem
the
state
of
california
passed
a
law
that
said
that,
"anyone
who
lives
next
door
to
an
impoverished
person
has
an
obligation
to
help
that
person
out.
"
and
make
up
the
difference
in
the
rent?
justice
scalia
so
we
are
just
quibbling
about
whether
the
connection
is
close
enough,
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
there
has
to
be
a
relationship
between
the
person
you
are
putting
the
burden
on
and
the
nature
of
the
hardship,
is
there
not?
justice
scalia
well,
no.
it
is
not
just
the
purpose
of
the
regulation.
it
is
the
evil
that
is
sought
to
be
eliminated,
is
it
not?
justice
scalia
you
could
protect
them
against
excessive
rents
in
a
lot
of
ways
such
as
making
their
next-door
neighbor
who
is
well-off,
make
up
the
difference,
and
you
say
that
would
be
no-good?
justice
scalia
and
you
think
it
is
a
rational
connection
that
i
happen
to
be
the
landlord
who
rented
to
let
us
say
an
affluent
person
who
loses
a
lot
of
money
in
the
stork
market
and
and
whose
income
goes
below
$34,000.
that
means
that
i
am
somehow
responsible
for
his
hardship?
justice
scalia
what
troubles
me
is
that
with
respect
to
all
landlords,
with
respect
to
all
rent
control
in
general,
you
can
easily
say
that
the
reason
for
the
inability
of
the
public
at-large
to
get
affordable
housing
is
the
fact
that
all
landlords
are
charging
too
much
money
taking
advantage
of
a
temporary
shortage
or
whatever
other
rationale
you
might
want
to
use.
there
is
a
connection
between
the
lack
of
affordable
housing
and
what
the
landlords
are
doing.
there
is
a
cause
and
effect
relationship,
but
there
is
no
cause
and
effect
relationship
whatever
between
the
hardship
of
a
particular
individual
and
the
landlord
who
happens
to
have
been
renting
his
apartment
to
that
individual,
either
before
or
after
the
individual
went
into
the
hardship
level.
justice
scalia
he
is
not
taking
advantage
of
the
housing
shortage
any
more.
you
have
eliminated
his
taking
advantage
of
the
housing
shortage
when
you
have
reduced
his
rent
to
what
you
say
is
a
reasonable
rent
for
everyone.
at
that
point
the
housing
shortage
is
out
of
the
question.
all
you
are
addressing
from
there
on
is
the
poverty
of
this
particular
individual
for
which
the
landlord
is
no
more
responsible
than
anyone
else
in
the
world.
justice
scalia
i
presume
if
they
could
do
this
for
hardship
tenants
they
could
do
it
for,
let
us
say,
the
elderly?
could
they
require,
you
know,
give
a
hearing
officer
discretion
to
reduce
it
for
the
elderly?
justice
scalia
for
police
officers
who
are
notoriously
ill-paid?
or
simply
the
municipality
wants
to
encourage
people
to
enlist
in
the
police
and
instead
of
giving
them
a
higher
salary
they
just
give
them
this
break
on
housing,
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
scalia
why?
i
am
a
landlord
who
has
chosen
to
rent
to
a
police
officer
just
like
these
people
are
landlords
who
have
chosen
to
rent
to
those
who
are
in
a
hardship
status.
justice
scalia
you
keep
saying
that.
that
is
a
good
test
for
public
utilities.
you
have
to
assure
public
utilities
that.
but
that
is
not
the
test
of
whether
there
has
been
a
taking
by
the
government
or
not,
is
it?
the
mere
fact
that
you
are
left
with
a
fair
return?
i
assume
that
if
i
own
property,
i
am
entitled
to
get
as
much
of
a
return
as
the
market
will
give
me.
if
the
government
limits
me
without
just
reason
to
a
fair
return
you
would
say
that
there
has
been
on
taking.
no
constitutional
violation.
justice
scalia
that
may
be.
my
only
point
is
you
do
not
establish
that
that
is
so
simply
by
the
fact
that
a
fair
rate
of
return
is
provided.
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
it
is
not
unfair
any
more
once
you
have
the
initial
reduction.
at
that
point
you
have
handled
the
problem
of
the
housing
shortage.
the
problem
that
remains
after
that...
once
you
make
the
initial
reduction
along...
on
the
basis
of
all
of
the
factors
except
the
hardship
factor,
you
have
eliminated
the
problem
of
unfair
benefit
to
the
landlord.
you
have
eliminated
the
housing
shortage
problem.
what
remains
after
that
is
a
poverty
problem,
is
that
not
right?
i
mean,
the
ordinary
factors
take
care
of
excessively
high
rents.
justice
scalia
but
that
is
a
poverty
factor.
that
is
a
poverty
factor,
not
a
landlord
gouging
the
public
factor,
right?
justice
scalia
the
california
supreme
court,
as
i
understand
it,
had
found
it
unconstitutional
for
california...
i
guess
it
was
a
state
law...
to
require
children
to
pay
the
expenses
of
care
for
their
impoverished
parents
in
mental
institutions?
and
they
found
that
unconstitutional?
justice
scalia
do
you
disagree
with
that
decision?
justice
scalia
what
if
the
ordinance
says
that
the
landlord
can
charge
a
higher
rent
unless
the
landlord
is
black?
justice
scalia
why
would
you
not
say,
"well,
wait
to
see
if
that
provision
is
applied.
"
"it
is
at
the
discretion
of
the
hearing
officer
to
rule
out
facial
challenge.
"
would
you
not?
justice
scalia
well,
is
not
an
"equal
protection"
argument
being
made
here?
