ms.
joan
r.

thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
seems
to
me
that
appellants
predicate
their
opposition
to
the
ordinance
on
a
number
of
incorrect
assumptions,
that
there
is
only
one
rational
purpose
for
rent
control,
and
that
is
to
correct
a
non-competitive
market.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
a
number
of
possible
purposes
for
rent
control,
including
for
example,
as
an
anti-inflationary
measure.
even
where
an
ordinance,
as
ours
is,
is
directed
at
a
housing
shortage,
it
can
be
directed
towards
correcting
the
social
ills
which
result
from
the
exploitation
of
the
housing
shortage,
not
just
the
market
imbalance
itself.
in
our
case
the
social
ill
that
we
are
attempting
to
address
is
the
dislocation
of
tenants
in
possession.
not
only
does
that
kind
of
dislocation
negatively
impact
the
individual
tenant,
but
it
also
affects
the
community
as
a
whole.
if
you
develop
a
pattern
of
residential
instability,
it
undermines
the
neighborhood
sense
of
unity.
also
today
we
increasingly
find
that
homelessness
which
results
from
the
escalating
market
rate
of
rents
is
an
increasing
problem
for
our
city.
the
city
has
a
variety
of
other
programs
which
address
the
problem
of
finding
affordable
housing
for
low
and
medium
income
tenants
who
are
looking
for
housing.
this
particular
regulation
is
addressed
at
protecting
those
who
are
already
in
possession
of
the
unit.
the
tenant
hardship
provision
directly
and
substantially
furthers
that
purpose.
it
prevents
the
landlords
from
taking
unfair
advantage
of
the
housing
shortage
at
the
expense
of
those
tenants
who
are
on
limited
and
fixed
incomes.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
the
ordinance...
yes,
essentially,
with
some
exceptions.
it
is
hard
to
say
"yes",
because
i
think
there
are
certain
assumptions--
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
--to
the
extent
that
your
question
is
"is
the
landlord
permitted
to
free
himself
from
the
constraints
of
rent
control
by
evicting
a
tenant,
he
cannot.
"
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
he
can
evict
the
tenant
for
any
reason
other
than
the
evasion
of
the
rent
control
ordinance.
and
the
tenant
hardship
provision.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
it
does
not
to
me,
because
he
continues...
i
think
that
the
problem
is
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
reasonable
rent
and
he
is
not
entitled
to
that
reasonable
rent.
what
he...
what
we
are
doing
is
limiting
an
excessive
rent,
and
we
are
limiting
it
more
stringently
in
that
situation.
any
landlord
may
at
any
time
have
a
hardship
tenant.
any
hardship
tenant
may
at
any
time
leave.
we
do
have
a
vacancy
decontrol
provision
that
allows
the
landlord
to
set
the
rent
at
market
rate
whenever
the
unit
is
voluntarily
vacated.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
the
answer
to
that
i
think
is
"yes",
if
there
is
a
proper
purpose.
in
my
mind
probably
a
proper
purpose
would
limit
that
to
necessary
items.
and
if
the
store...
if
there
was
an
administrative
system
that
assured
the
storekeeper
a
fair
return,
i
think
that
there
is
no
problem.
it
is
very
similar
to
the
lifeline
type
of
situation
that
appears
in
the
utility
context,
or
we
do
that
with
a
variety
of
services
that
are
provided,
like
garbage
services,
where
you
have
to
give
the
elderly
and
low-income
people
an
opportunity
for
a
lifeline
service.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
i
do
not
see
that
in
that
situation
there
is
a
connection.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
i
think
that
very
much
at
the
heart
of
the
argument
is--
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
--there
has
to
be
a
rational
relationship
between
the
purpose
of
the
regulation
and
the
person
who
is
being
regulated.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
well,
i
think
we
are
saying
the
same
thing.
i
think
in
our
case
the
purpose
of
the
ordinance
is
to
protect
tenants
in
possession
from
excessive
rents
charged
by
their
landlords,
but
that
is
evil.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
because
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
a
rational
connection
with
the
next-door
neighbor.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
i
do
not
think
that
you
are
responsible
for
his
hardship.
and
i
do
not
think
under
the
terms
of
our
ordinance,
the
hearing
officer
would
be
likely
to
find
that
to
be
the
kind
of
unreasonable
severe
financial
hardship.
but
i
do
think
that
since
we
could
impose
a
lower
rent
ceiling
for
all
landlords
to
allow
many
landlords
to
further
exploit
the
housing
shortage
while
limiting
that
exploitation
in
the
case
where
the
tenants
were
likely
to
be
dispossessed
by
that
fact,
is
a
logical
and
rational
distinction.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
i
think
the
connection
is
with
the
effect
of
letting
the
landlord
take
the
maximum
rent...
we
are
allowing
the
landlord
to
have
a
rent
that
is
well-above
what
is
constitutionally
mandated.
and
to
say
to
that
landlord
that
the
effect
of
your
taking
advantage
of
the
housing
shortage,
that
is
not
an
increment
of
rent
that
the
landlord
has
an
entitlement
to
constitutionally.
he
is
entitled
constitutionally
to
a
fair
return.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
i
do
not
think
so
because
what
you
are
assuming
is
that
we
are
allowing
the
landlords
in
the
case
of
non-hardship
tenants
to
take
what
is
the
reasonable
rent,
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
"the
reasonable
rent".
i
think
we
have
an
unusually
generous
ordinance
that
allows
landlords
to
maximize
their
profits
to
a
great
extent,
much
more
than
other
rent
control
ordinances.
and
what
we
are
saying
is,
"we
will
allow
you
to
do
that
to
the
extent
your
use
of
your
property
does
not
create
a
problem
or
a
hardship
for
somebody
else.
"
"i
think
the
word.
"
hardship
"comes
in
two
senses.
"
"one
is
we
are
labelling
the
financial
need
of
the
tenant.
"
"but
i
think
it
is
also
the
hardship
which
is
imposed
on
the
tenant
when
the
landlord
maximizes
his
profit
at
literally
the
expense
of
the
tenants.
"
"i
think
you
can
look
at
any
price
or
rent
control
or
rate
regulatory
ordinance
as
a
shifting
of
the
benefit
from
the
producer
to
the
consumer.
"
"to
that
extent,
all
of
the
price
regulation
creates
a
subsidy
of
the
consumer
by
the
producer.
"
"we
are
saying
in
most
cases
that,
landlord,
you
can
really
have
the
vast
majority
of
the
increment
of
rent
increase
that
you
would
like
to
have,
except
to
the
extent
that
it
is
going
to
be
harmful.
"
and
to
that
extent
we
limit
it
to
some
extent.
but
at
all
points,
we
assure
you
the
fair
return
on
the
value
of
your
property,
"which
is
a
very
generous
method
of
calculating
fair
return.
"
the
ordinance,
when
you
look
at
the
ordinance
as
a
whole
and
you
see
that
the
landlord
once
he
rents
a
new
unit
and
sets
the
rate
at
market
rate
value,
the
following
year
can
raise
the
rent
up
to
eight
percent
and
not
even
be
subject
to
a
hearing.
eight
percent,
i
think,
probably
provides
him
with
fair
return.
he
can,
however,
impose
a
greater
increase.
and
as
you
have
been
told,
he
can
do
that
by
simply
noticing
the
tenants.
the
increase
will
be
subject
to
a
hearing
only
for
a
tenant
that
files
and
asks
for
a
hearing.
at
that
hearing
the
hearing
officer
is
required
to
allow
the
landlord
to
pass
through
all
of
his
costs
of
capital
improvement,
operating
and
maintenance,
and
rehabilitation;
plus
the
landlord
receives
five
percent.
he
can
also
pass
through
certain
of
the
cost
of
debt
service.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
ordinance
stopped
here
it
would
be
facially
valid,
but
the
ordinance
allows
the
hearing
officer
to
grant
an
even
greater
increase
if
it
is
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
that
is
correct.
certainly
it
is
the
rent
control
ordinance
and
certainly
it
is
intended--
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
--that
is
correct.
i
think
it
is
a
mistake
to
talk
about
a
"free"
market
in
the
area
of
rental
housing.
i
think
that
the
local
government
limits
that
market
considerably
at
all
times
based
on
various
land
use
and
environmental
constraints.
there
is
never
a
time
when
the
free
market
works
"freely"
in
this
area.
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
stress
that
the
hearing
officer
in
determining
whether
there
is
an
increment
of
rent
that
can
be
charged
above
the
other
tests
in
the
ordinance
is
required
to
ensure
the
fair
return
on
the
value
of
the
property.
when
it
comes
to
the
balancing
test,
he
balances
a
variety
of
factors
to
determine
what
is
a
reasonable
rent
under
the
circumstances.
he
may
or
may
not
determine
that
a
particular
tenant
that...
excuse
me...
a
proposed
increase
constitutes
an
unreasonably
severe
hardship
to
the
tenant,
and
even
if
he
makes
that
determination,
he
may
or
may
not
limit
that
increment
of
rent.
he
is
required
to
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances,
including
what
the
market
rate
rents
are;
including
also
what
the
past
history
of
rent
increases
for
the
unit
have
been.
there
is
no
particular
formula
mandated
for
determining
fair
return.
a
"fair
return"
appears
to
be
the
"reasonable
cost
to
the
landlord
plus
a
fair
profit.
"
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
the
"maximum
possible
return",
and
i
do
not
believe,
as
appellants
argue,
that
it
is
the
"return
he
would
receive
in
the
absence
of
a
housing
shortage.
"
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
for
the
elderly
if
there
were
circumstances...
a
totality
of
circumstance.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
be
all
right
because
i
do
not--
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
--i
think
that
the
purpose
here
is
not
to
give
money
to
the
tenants.
the
purpose
here
is
to
prevent
society
from
having
the
problems
that
come
from
the
dislocation
of
the
tenant
in
possession.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
articulate
a
purpose
other
than
the
purpose
that
you
have
articulated
for
a
special
rule
for
police
officers.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
i
think
that
the
city
has
a
wide
variety
of
programs
that
are
possible
and
our
city
is
perhaps
in
the
forefront
of
a
variety
of
programs
that
go
to
providing
affordable
housing
for
tenants.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is...
there
is
a
particular
program
or
only
one
particular
way
that
a
legislative
body
can
determine
to
address
certain
problems.
the
problem
here
we
feel
is
the
dislocation
of
these
particular
tenants.
and
that
is
a
problem
which
is
addressed
by
one
regulatory
scheme
that
we
have
provided.
i
think
that
with
regard
to
the
question
of
reasonable
rents,
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
utility
cases
have
developed
a
concept
of
a
"zone
of
reasonableness.
"
"that
zone
is
bordered
at
the
producer's
end,
with
the
producer's
interest
against
confiscation
and
at
the
consumer
end
of
the
continuum,
by
the
consumer's
interest
against
exorbitant
rates.
"
"rates
can
be
limited
anywhere
within
that
continuum
above
the
lowest
reasonable
rate.
"
"our
zone
is
bordered
well-above
the
lowest
reasonable
rate
because
the
landlord
is
guaranteed
a
fair
return
on
the
value
of
the
property.
"
at
the
other
end
of
the
continuum,
at
the
consumer
end
of
the
continuum,
the
concern
is
to
prevent
the
consumer
against
rates
which
are
unreasonable
under
the
circumstances,
and
tenant
hardship
is
just
simply
one
of
the
circumstances
that
is
taken
into
effect.
i
believe
that
there
has
been
no
taking
in
this
case
because,
as
appellants
agree,
there
has
been
no
denial
of
the
viable
economic
use
of
the
property
and
i
believe
that
the
property
substantially
advances
a
legitimate
state
interest.
there
are
no
facts;
there
are
no
factual
allegations
in
this
case
to
enable
the
traditional
ad-hoc
analysis.
it
seems
to
me,
however,
that
the
economic
impact
under
the
circumstances
of
our
ordinance
where
the
landlord
is
assured
a
fair
return
on
the
value
of
his
property
will
not
be--
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
--i
think
you
have
both
ends
of
the
test.
one
is
the
legitimate
purpose
and
the
other
is
the
economic
viability.
i
think
that
all
regulation,
or
most
regulation,
limits
the
return.
certainly
our
zoning
regulations
limit
the
return
that
property
owners
would
otherwise
receive.
i
think
that
is
the
test
once
you
have
established
that
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest,
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
preventing
the
dislocation
of
tenants
who
are
in
possession
due
to
the
landlord's
taking
advantage
of
the
housing
shortage.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
i
think
that
there
are
two
tests,
and
i
think
that
we
meet
them
both.
but
i
think
once
you
take
as
i
do
the
fact
that
we
have
met
the
first
test,
of
the
state
interest,
i
think
the
rest
of
your
analysis
is
really
an
analysis
of
economics
and
i
think
that
the
fcc
v.
florida
power
corporation
case
which
this
court
decided
last
term,
really
is
very,
very
much
on
point.
in
that
case,
the
rates
charged
were
actually
rolled
back.
it
was
not
simply
a
limiting
of
future
increases,
but
literally
a
rollback
of
rates.
this
court
found
in
fact
that,
because
the
rates
were
not
confiscatory,
that
the
ordinance
could,
or
the
regulation,
could
stringently
limit
the
amount
of
money
that
was
charged.
i
think
that
certainly
the
city
of
san
jose
does
have
an
ordinance
that
transfers
benefits
and
burdens
but
as
the
california
supreme
court
said,
"oil
price
and
rent
control
operates
in
the
same
fashion.
"
i
do
not
think
that
ours
is
really
distinguishable.
i
think
if
you
look
at
it
the
way
we
do,
what
we
are
doing
is
preventing
the
landlord
from
unfairly
profiting
from
the
market
condition
at
the
expense
of
the
tenants.
and
i
think
the
fact
that
we
allow
him--
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
--depending
on
the
circumstances
of
the
tenant,
i
do
not
see
that
the
hearing
officer
takes
the
other
factors
and
balances
them
and
then
comes
up
with
what
is
a
reasonable
rent.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
it
is
the
determinant
of
how
far
we
will
allow
him
to
gouge.
i
think
that
once
you
get
beyond
the
value
of
the
fair
return
on
the
value
of
the
property,
we
are
allowing
gouging,
and
in
some
cases
we
are
allowing
more
gouging,
not
that
we
are
requiring
a
reduction.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
that
is
correct.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
i
do
not
disagree
with
that
decision,
but
i
agree
with
the
california
supreme
court
that
that
decision
is
not
applicable
here.
and
that
our
situations
are
very
distinguishable.
i
think
in
those
situations
there
is
no
general
connection.
we
have
here
a
rent
control
program.
appellants
have
agreed
that
rent
control
is
permissible.
we
have
the
option
of
a
much
more
stringent
rent
control
ordinance
and
we
are
merely
looking
at
the
degree
of
return
which
will
be
permitted
within
that
zone
of
reasonableness.
i
think
that
from
the
perspective
of
"equal
protection"
that
these
kinds
of
distinctions
are
allowed.
i
think
that
the
controlling
case
is
new
orleans
v.
dukes.
i
think
that
it
is
not
essential
that
all
people
be
treated
with
mathematical
exactness.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
i
have
very
mixed
feelings
about
the
standing
of
mr.
pennell.
i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
case
directly
on-point.
i
think
that
standing
is
determined
at
the
time
the
jurisdiction
is
established
for
this
court.
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
cannot
find
any
way
in
which
we
have
been
disadvantaged
or
the
situation
has
changed
for
us
with
mr.
pennell
coming
in
and
out
of
ownership
in
the
city
of
san
jose.
i
think
that
if
mr.
pennell
has
standing,
we
have
never
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
reach
the
standing
of
the
association.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
then
i
would
urge
you
not
to
find
that
there
is
standing
for
the
association.
i
think
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
where
the
association
is
asking
for
an
advisory
opinion.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
that
is
correct.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
that
is
correct.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
nowhere
in
the
record
did
mr.
pennell
claim
to
have
a
hardship
tenant.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
i
think
that
our
"standing"
argument
is
very
much
a
species
of
our
"ripeness"
argument.
i
think
in
the
absence
of
a
concrete
case,
we
really
do
not
know
how
the
ordinance
will
operate,
and
that
has
created
a
problem
for
us.
i
do
think
that
we
argued
against
the
"ripeness
in
general"
in
that
our
"standing"
argument
is
a
species
of
that,
but
in
addition,
i
think
it
is
inappropriate
for
an
association
of
this
sort
to
be
able
to
bring
essentially
a
taking
claim.
a
taking
claim
needs
the
kind
of
analysis
that
depends
on
at
least
allegations
with
regard
to
particular
situations.
the
taking
is
not
in
general,
it
is
in
specific.
and
we
have
felt
disadvantaged
all
along
in
our
inability
to
look
at
a
concrete
situation
and
be
able
to
explain
how
the
ordinance
would
operate.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
that
is
an
unconstitutional
purpose.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
i
would
allow
a
facial
challenge
in
that
situation
but
not
under
the
taking
clause.
what
we
are
really
talking
about
at
that
point
is
the
"equal
protection"
argument.
ms.
joan
r.
gallo
the
"equal
protection"
argument
is
being
made
here
but
the
gravamen,
i
think
as
the
appellant
said,
is
the
"taking"
argument.
thank
you
very
much.
