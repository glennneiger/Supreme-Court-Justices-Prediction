justice
stevens
in
fact,
taking
it
one
step
further,
mr.
miller,
as
i
understand
the
supreme
court
of
california's
opinion,
the
minimum
that
you
can
get
has
always
got
to
give
you
a
fair
return
on
your
investment.
justice
stevens
so
that
if
they
decided
in
your
case
that
$375
would
not
give
you
a
fair
return,
then
he
would
not
be
permitted
to
give
the
$375?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
what
if
i
did
it
in
reverse
and
said
that
if
you
had
$375
as
a
reasonable
return,
that
if
you
had
tenants
who
are
multi-millionaires,
you
can
charge
them
an
extra
$10?
justice
stevens
that
would
be
unconstitutional
too?
justice
stevens
what
constitutional
provision
would
my
hypothetical
violate
if
they
said,
"the
normal
rent
is
$375
but
if
you
have
a
very
wealthy
tenant,
you
can
charge
him
an
extra
$25?
"
would
that
be
clearly
unconstitutional
also?
justice
stevens
what
portion
of
the
constitution
would
that
violate?
justice
stevens
it
is
a
legitimate
consideration
in
establishing
income
tax
rates.
justice
stevens
dentists
sometimes
take
into
account
the
wealth
of
their
patients,
i
think.
and
doctors
and
lawyers
do.
justice
stevens
what
is
the
difference
constitutionally?
justice
stevens
what
about
a
state
law
that
required
lawyers
to
devote
ten
percent
of
their
time
to
public
service?
justice
stevens
this
was
unconstitutional.
justice
stevens
mr.
miller,
what
about
rate
regulation?
could
a
public
utility
commission
require
the
supplier
of
electricity
to
charge
a
higher
price
to
industry,
just
as
industry
may
pay
a
higher
tax
rate,
and
a
lower
price
to
the
homeowner?
justice
stevens
no,
well,
all
the
consumers...
all
the
consumers
who
are
less
able
to
pay
large
sums
of
money
for
their
utility
bills.
justice
stevens
but
by
hypothesis
it
is
not
spread
out
over
everyone.
it
is
a
higher
rate
to
those
who
are
better
able
to
pay,
namely
the
very
large
users.
but
maybe
it
does
not
exactly
work
that
way.
but
i
am
using
this
as
a
hypothetical.
justice
stevens
well,
one
landlord
is
renting
apartments
to
thousands
of
tenants,
and
some
of
them
are
better
able
to
pay
than
others.
we
just
make
a
different
kind
of
classification.
justice
stevens
but
you
are
saying
it
is
constitutionally
impermissible
to
take
ability
to
pay
into
account?
justice
stevens
but
you
would
not
contend
that
it
was
unconstitutional
in
the
rate
regulation
context
to
take
ability
to
pay
into
account,
say,
as
a
class,
homeowners
are
less
able
to
pay
than
factory
owners,
is
that
constitutionally
impermissible?
justice
stevens
mr.
miller,
is
that
all...
are
there
not
a
lot
of
existing
ordinances
out
there
that
permit
any
variety
of
factors
to
be
taken
into
account?
are
then
not
also
unconstitutional?
because
they
may
be
doing
the
very
thing
you
are
objecting
to?
justice
stevens
and
that
would
make
the
ordinance
on
its
face
unconstitutional
because
they
are
permitted
sub
rosa
to
do
that.
