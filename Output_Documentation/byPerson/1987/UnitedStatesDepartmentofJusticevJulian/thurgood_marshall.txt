mr.
kneedler,
once
you
give
them
a
copy
of
it
to
look
at
it,
is
somebody
in
there
with
him
as
he's
looking
at
it?
justice
marshall
is
he
allowed
to
take
it
to
his
office?
justice
marshall
well,
then
all
the
things
you're
worried
about
would
have
happened.
justice
marshall
you're
afraid
that
he'll
show
it
to
somebody.
justice
marshall
i
don't
see
how
it
can
possibly
be
confidential
once
you
show
it
to
him.
justice
marshall
well,
but
the
defendant
can
talk
to
the
world
at
large.
justice
marshall
that's
a
lot
of
speculation.
