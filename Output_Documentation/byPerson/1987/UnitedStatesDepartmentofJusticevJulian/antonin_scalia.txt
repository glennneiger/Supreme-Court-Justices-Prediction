doesn't
that
exemption
also
require
that
either
the
inability
to
obtain
it
be
absolute
or
that
the
specific
standard
for
making
it
available
be
set
forth?
justice
scalia
what's
the
specific
standard
here?
justice
scalia
doesn't
that
last
exemption
have
to
be
absolute,
that
is,
matters
to
be
withheld.
doesn't
it
mean
matters
to
be
withheld
absolutely?
justice
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
you
can't
say
that
just
incorporating
it
into
the
deliberative
process
is
the
criterion.
you
can
get
a
memorandum
from
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
that
the
agency
considers,
and--
justice
scalia
--do
you
think
it
could
encompass
an
nam
memorandum
if
the
law
required
the
agency
to
consider
nam
memoranda?
justice
scalia
but
the
are
in
those
consultant
cases,
the
consultants
are
really
working
for
another
agency
in
any
case.
they
are
part
of
the
executive
branch.
justice
scalia
mr.
glitzenstein,
the
fact
that
the
request
is
by
the
subject
of
the
report
is
it
conceded
that
that's
irrelevant?
i
mean,
if
you're
right
that
the
subject
of
the
report
can
get
it,
anybody
can
get
it.
isn't
that
so?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
true
as
far
as
personal
privacy
is
concerned,
but
as
far
as
exposing
the
identity
of
people
who
spoke
about
the
individual
were,
what
they
said,
and
other
such
matters,
that
could
be
obtained
not
only
by
the
defendant
but
by
anybody,
presumably.
justice
scalia
but
if
it
has
to
go
to
the
defendant,
it
has
to
go
to
the
rest
of
the
world,
isn't
that
right,
except
for
those
personal
matters
that
relate
only
to
the
defendant.
that
arguably
could
be
kept
out
from
the
rest
of
the
world
under
6.
but
all
the
other
stuff
about
confidential
sources,
if
the
defendant
can
get
it,
anybody
can
get
it.
justice
scalia
mr.
glitzenstein,
now
you
could
say
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
the
rule.
could
you
give
me
some
reason
why
it
makes
sense
to
allow
the
parole
commission
to
do
what
the
court
is
specifically
forbidden
from
doing.
it's
such
an
odd
thing
to
specifically
forbid
the
court
from
turning
it
over,
but
then
when
the
court
gives
it
to
the
parole
commission,
allowing
the
parole
commission
to
turn
it
over.
and
if
i
have
a
statute
that
arguably
prevents
the
parole
commission
just
as
it
prevents
the
court,
i'm
inclined
to
read
the
law
to
make
some
sense.
now,
tell
me
why
it
makes
any
sense
to
allow
the
parole
commission
to
do
it
when
the
court
can't?
justice
scalia
you're
saying
congress
is
privileged
to
make
no
sense
if
it
wants
to,
and
i
agree
with
you.
i
agree
with
you.
if
that's
what
they
said,
that's
fine.
but
let's
assume
that
i
want
to
try
to
make
it
make
sense.
now,
why
would
it
make
sense
to
allow
the
parole
commission
to
turn
it
over?
justice
scalia
all
those
good
things
you've
just
said,
those
good
uses
all
relate
to
use
by
the
particular
defendant.
it's
very
strange
for
congress
to
serve
those
purposes
by
saying
the
document
shall
be
available
to
the
world
at
large
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
which
doesn't
require
any
particular
showing
of
need.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
particular
defendant.
it's
anybody
in
the
world.
that's
a
strange
place
to
further
that
policy.
justice
scalia
mr.
glitzenstein,
the
argument
you
just
made
that
there
are
other
protections
which
would
keep
away
from
the
public
or
from
any
requester
information
that
impinges
upon
some
privacy
right
or
some
other
governmental
interest,
you
can
always
make
that
argument
under
exemption
5,
can't
you?
i
mean,
you
can
always
say,
hat
do
you
need
exemption
5
for
if
it's
really
private,
exemption
6
will
cover
it.
if
it's
going
to
disclose
informants,
the
criminal
information
exemption
would
cover
it.
you
can
always
run
that
argument,
and
you
would
just
read
exemption
5
out
of
the
statute.
for
some
reason,
the
statute
says
if
it's
an
interagency
or
intra
agency
memorandum,
regardless
of
whether
these
other
interests
are
impinged
or
not,
it
won't
be
provided.
justice
scalia
well,
it's
not
really
absolute.
this
exemption
is
not
mandatory.
the
government,
even
if
we
agree
with
you
that
the
exemption
applies,
the
government
need
not
invoke
it.
