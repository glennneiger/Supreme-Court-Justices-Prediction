justice
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
there
are
provisions
of
the
parole
commission
and
reorganization
act
that
specify
certain
types
of
information
in
the
reports
that
i
guess
both
sides
agree
may
be
deleted
or
excluded
from
any
report
before
release.
justice
o'connor
right.
so
what
is
left
then
in
the
report
that
the
government
is
particularly
concerned
about
protecting
after
the
deletion
of
those
sensitive
things?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
most
of
that
would
be
covered
by
exemption
6?
justice
o'connor
i'm
just
wondering
what's
left
after
you
take
out
the
sensitive
things
and
take
out
what
exemption
6
covers.
justice
o'connor
but
the
rule
doesn't
apply
to
the
parole
commission,
i
gather?
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
it
makes
it
very
hard
to
argue
that
it
falls
under
exemption
3.
justice
o'connor
but
i
guess
there
is
a
split
of
authority
on
whether
they
are
inter-agency
or
intra-agency
memorandums.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
parole
commission
may
not
give
a
copy
to
the
defendant
if
it
chooses
to
do
so?
justice
o'connor
could
the
defendant
possibly
get
a
copy
under
the
privacy
act?
justice
o'connor
mr.
glitzenstein,
do
you
concede
that
some
lower
courts
have
recognized
a
sort
of
privilege
against
disclosure
to
third
parties
generally
of
these
presentence
reports?
justice
o'connor
is
there
any
case
which
you
have
found
in
which
a
court
has
said
a
third
party
may
get
a
presentence
report
after
the
conclusion
of
the
sentencing
process?
justice
o'connor
but
that's
under
the
specialized
need
standard.
