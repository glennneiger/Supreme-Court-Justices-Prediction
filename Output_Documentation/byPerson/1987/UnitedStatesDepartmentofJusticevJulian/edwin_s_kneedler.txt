mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
copies
of
presentence
reports
that
are
in
the
possession
of
the
parole
commission
are
subject
to
mandatory
release
under
the
public
disclosure
provisions
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
the
presentence
reports
have
long
been
regarded
as
highly
confidential
documents.
that
confidentiality
protects
the
ability
of
the
probation
officers
who
prepare
the
reports
to
obtain
information
from
various
sources.
for
this
reason,
the
courts
have
uniformly
held
that
presentence
reports
are
not
routinely
available
to
persons
who
might
seek
to
discover
contents
for
use
in
litigation.
we
submit
that
this
governmental
privilege
permits
the
parole
commission
to
withhold
their
copies
of
presentence
reports
from
the
general
public
under
exemption
5
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
respondents
concede
that
presentence
reports
are
highly
confidential
documents
and
that
they
are
almost
invariably
exempt
from
mandatory
release
under
the
act.
but
they
submit
that
because
they
are
the
subjects
of
the
presentence
reports,
the
persons
about
whom
the
reports
were
prepared
they
have
a
special
right
under
foia
that
isn't
shared
by
any
other
member
of
the
public
to
read
those
reports.
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
that
that
argument
is
inconsistent
both
with
settled
principles
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
and
also
with
settled
principles
covering
disclosure
of
presentence
reports.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
they
can't
even
be
shown
to
the
defendant.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
reports
contain
a
wealth
of
information
concerning
the
individual's
background,
but
also
the
background
of
his
family,
his
relationships
with
associates,
employers.
there's
a
lot
of
information
that
is
personal
both
to
the
defendant
and
others.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
may
or
may
not
be.
it
depends.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there's
also
information
that's
furnished
by
sources
of
information
that
may
not
be
regarded
as
so
confidential
that
the
defendant
can't
even
see
that
information.
if
it
was
that
confidential,
then
that
could
be
withheld
under
one
of
the
provisions
to
which
you're
referring.
but
there's
also
a
more
general
desire
to
maintain
confidentiality
to
encourage
sources
to
come
forward.
because
as
the
administrative
office
explained
to
the
parole
commission
when
they
were
considering
whether
to
change
their
policy,
all
sources
of
information
are
told
what
they
furnish
to
the
probation
officer
will
be
shown
to
the
defendant
and
shown
to
the
attorney
for
the
government,
but
that
the
defendant
cannot
keep
a
copy
of
it.
and
that
it
will
be
disclosed
beyond
that
initial
showing
only
with
the
consent
of
the
court.
and
this
affords
the
sources
some
sense
of
protection
and
confidence
that
the
report
that
contains
their
disclosures
will
not
be
passed
on
by
the
defendant,
for
example
if
he
gets
a
copy
of
it,
to
third
persons
who
might
use
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
rules
do
not
permit
that
and
the
standard
procedure,
rule
32
c
at
sentencing,
for
example,
says
that
the
defendant
and
the
counsel
for
the
government
may
read
a
copy
of
the
report.
and
that's
the
word
that
the
rule
uses.
and
when
the
rule
was
proposed,
this
court's
version
of
the
rule
stated
that
all
copies
of
the
report
must
be
returned
to
the
court
and
copies
could
not
be
made.
congress
modified
that
to
permit
the
court,
in
its
discretion,
on
an
occasional
case
to
let
the
defendant
keep
a
copy
of
the
report.
but
rule
32
specifically
says
all
copies
of
the
report
must
be
returned
to
the
court.
and
for
the
defendant
to
make
a
copy
of
it
would
be
directly
inconsistent
with
that
requirement
that
they
be
returned.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
the
parole
commission
from
the
outset
has
followed
directly
parallel
procedures.
and
this
makes
a
lot
of
sense,
because
when
the
parole
commission
act
was
passed
in
1976,
congress
saw
it
as
a
continuation
of
the
sentencing
process.
the
court
sets
the
sentence
within
a
range
typically,
and
then
the
parole
commission
decides
how
much
of
that
the
defendant
will
serve.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
submit
that
it
does
because
rule
32
specifically
provides
that
the
report
is
to
be
returned
to
the
court
upon
the
completion
of
sentencing,
and
obviously
the
defendant
can't
get
a
copy
of
the
report
from
the
court
unless
the
court
in
its
discretion
permits
him
to
do
so.
that
same
authority
to
withhold,
we
submit,
attaches
to
the
report
as
it's
transferred
to
the
parole
commission.
our
basic
submission
in
this
case--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there's
no
case
specifically
relating
to
the
presentence
reports,
no.
but
the
express
requirements
of
exemption
3
are
met
in
this
case.
exemption
3(b)
refers
to
statutes
that
refer
to
particular
matters
to
be
withheld.
this
is
a
statute
that
refers
to
particular
matters
to
be
withheld,
presentence
reports,
and
those
are
the
specific
requirements.
respondents
say
that
because
rule
32
speaks
to
the
court
and
doesn't
expressly
refer
to
the
parole
commission,
that
it's
not
an
exemption
3
statute.
exemption
3(b)
does
not
require
that
the
statute
on
which
withholding
rests
specifically
refer
to
the
agency
that
happens
to
be
in
the
possession
of
the
report,
and
that
requirement
would
make
no
sense,
because
the
statute
speaks
to
the
document
to
be
withheld
and
reflects
an
assessment
by
congress
as
to
whether
that
document
should
be
withheld.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
are
actually
three
separate
subparts
to
exemption
3.
exemption
3(a)
refers
to
situations
in
which
the
report
can
be
withheld
in
the
manner
that
leaves
no
discretion.
exemption
3(b)
has
two
alternatives.
one,
the
statutes
that
refer
to
particular
criteria,
and
the
other
in
the
alternative,
the
statute
can
refer
to
particular
matters
to
be
withheld.
those
are
in
the
alternative.
in
this
case,
we're
relying
on
the
part
of
the
statute
that
refers
to
particular
matters
to
be
withheld,
presentence
reports.
that
part
does
not
require
that
the
statute
also
contain
criteria.
what
congress
was
aiming
at
was
narrowing
the
categories
of
information
that
could
be
withheld.
and
what
it
said
is,
well,
if
the
statute
specifically
tells
the
administrator
how
to
decide
what
to
withhold,
that's
an
exemption
3
statute.
or
as
here
refers
to
a
particular
document.
and
rule
32
specifically
refers
to
presentence
reports.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
that
were
true,
it
would
be
redundant
with
respect
to
exemption
3(a)
which
does
require
that
it
be
absolute
and
that
there
be
no
discretion.
exemption
3(b)
for
instance
in
the
cia
v.
sims,
which
was
a
3(b)
statute
case,
the
court
recognized
that
the
director
of
the
cia
had
the
discretion
to
release
information
that
he
was
charged
with
protecting,
and
that
was
committed
to
his
discretion,
and
that
did
not
undermine
the
3(b)
status
of
the
report.
and
3(b)
is
particularly
apt
in
this
case
we
think
because
congress
specifically
focused
on
the
question,
really
the
question
in
this
case,
whether
the
subject
of
the
report
should
have
a
right
to
receive
a
copy
of
that
report.
and
congress,
like
this
court,
in
promulgating
the
rule
decided
that
he
should
not.
our
basic
submission
in
this
case,
though,
is
that
these
reports
are
protected
by
exemption
5
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
exemption
5
refers
to
inter
or
intra
agency
memorandums
that
would
not
be
available
by
law
to
a
party
in
litigation
with
the
agency.
and
the
courts
have
uniformly
held,
as
i
mentioned
before,
that
presentence
reports
are
not
routinely
available
to
persons
seeking
to
discover
them
for
use
in
pending
litigation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there's
not
a
split
of
authority
on
that
question.
respondents
argue
that
they
are
not
covered
by
that.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
although
respondent
julian
argued
that,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
address
it,
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
in
the
durns
case,
held
that
they
are.
and
we
think
that
that's
pretty
clear
in
this
case.
the
phrases
inter
agency
and
intra
agency
memorandums,
as
we
see
it,
was
designed
to
refer
to
materials
that
are
kept
internal
to
the
government.
and
as
the
d.c.
circuit
said
in
the
ryan
case
which
is
really
the
leading
case
on
construing
this
phrase,
there's
no
indication
that
congress
intended
those
to
be
rigidly
exclusive
terms,
but
rather
were
intended
to
encompass
materials
that
are
incorporated
into
the
deliberative
process
of
the
agency.
and
here
we
think
that's
particularly
clear
because
congress
has
in
effect
recognized
that
the
probation
officer
prepares
the
report
for
the
parole
commission
as
well
as
the
court,
directed
the
probation
officer
to
furnish
it
to
the
court,
and
directed
the
parole
commission
to
consider
the
report
as
part
of
its
deliberative
process.
in
fact,
it's
really
the
most
basic
document
traditionally
that
the
parole
commission
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
rely
upon.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
it
can't
be
just
something
volunteered
by
an
outsider.
but
here,
congress
has
effectively
made
the
probation
officer
part
of
the
deliberative
process
by
directing
that
he
furnish
the
report
that
he
has
made
to
the
parole
commission.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
statute
effectively
made
the
nam
part
of
the
government's
decisionmaking
process.
it
would
be
one
thing
if
they
said,
consider
as
under
the
apa,
an
agency
would
typically
have
a
duty
to
consider
comments
submitted
by
any
outsider.
we're
not
arguing
that.
what
we
are
arguing
is
where
the
entity
outside
the
government
submits
something
to
the
agency,
effectively
as
an
agent
of
the
government,
not
as
an
outsider,
then
exemption
5
applies.
as
we
cite
in
our
brief,
there
are
cases
from
four
or
five
circuits
that
have
uniformly
held
that
submissions
by
outside
consultants
or
experts
that
are
retained
by
an
agency
in
a
particular
occasion
to
submit
reports
to
an
agency
in
connection
with
some
project,
that
those
reports
are
covered
by
exemption
5.
because
congress
recognized
that
the
deliberative
process
occasionally
requires
an
inclusion
of
materials
obtained
from
outsiders.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
not
necessarily.
in
a
number
of
cases
we've
referred
to,
these
are
private
persons
who
are
in
effect
part
of
the
agency.
this
is
on
intra
agency
rationale,
the
outside
consultants
are
really
part
of
the
agency
for
that
purpose
because
it's
necessary
for
the
agency
to
use
their
services
in
connection
with
a
deliberation.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
this
view
is
also
reflected
in
the
background
of
foia
itself.
both
as
this
court
recognized
in
weber
aircraft
for
example,
the
machin
privilege
which
protects
reports
concerning
aircraft
accidents,
the
machin
privilege
was
specifically
considered
by
congress
and
one
that
congress
intended
to
make
applicable
under
exemption
5.
well,
in
machin
itself,
the
witness
statements
that
were
involved
were
statements
of
outsiders.
they
were
not
statements
of...
perhaps
some
of
them
were
but
the
principal
focus
was
on
a
report
that
was
not
submitted
by
a
person
in
the
agency.
and
other
privileges
under
exemption
5
such
as
the
work
product
privilege,
it
would
be
odd
to
cut
the
privilege
off
depending
upon
whether
the
person
submitting
a
statement
was
in
the
government
or
outside.
so
there
are
a
number
of
privileges
where
the
agency
might
have
to
rely
on
some
materials
submitted
from
outside,
and
for
that
purpose,
the
submitter
is
regarded
as
part
of
the
agency.
with
respect
to
the
further
requirements
of
exemption
5,
as
i've
said,
i
think
now
eight
circuits
have
made
clear
that
presentence
reports
are
not
routinely
available
to
person
seeking
them
in
civil
discovery.
and
the
test
under
exemption
5
is
whether
a
document
is
routinely
or
normally
available
to
a
person
on
civil
discovery.
not
whether
it
might
be
made
available
to
a
person
who
has
a
special
connection
with
it
or
a
special
interest
in
it,
or
a
special
need
for
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
the
cases
that
we've
relied
upon
have
generally
been
where
third
parties
have
sought
copies
of
the
reports,
either
in
connection
with
pending
civil
litigation
or
in
some
cases
in
criminal
litigation
where
the
defendant
has
sought
the
report
of
a
government
witness
or
a
codefendant.
but
again
the
test
under
exemption
5
is
whether
they
would
normally
be
available.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
depends.
in
the
sort
of
case,
you're
describing
it
may
be.
for
example,
if
the
defendant
is
suing
the
government
in
a
way
that
relates
to
the
presentence
report
and
he
could
make
a
showing
of
special
particularized
need
for
the
report,
he
could
obtain
a
copy
of
it
then.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
the
subject
of
the
report
just
like
any
member
of
the
public
could
get
a
copy
of
the
report
only
upon
a
showing
of
special
need.
it's
not
routinely
handed
out
as
a
matter
of
course.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
but
i
mean,
it's
not
routinely
made
available.
it
is
privileged
and
the
person
seeking
the
document
in
the
litigation
with
the
agency
would
have
to
show
a
special
need
for
it.
that
he
couldn't
obtain
the
information
from
some
other--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that's
the
general
rule
under
exemption
5.
in
fact,
under
grolier,
the
court
faced
a
very
similar
situation.
there
the
argument
was
made
that
a
court
in
previous
litigation
involving
the
subsidiary
of
grolier,
itself,
the
requester,
had
ordered
the
disclosure
of
the
particular
documents
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiff
there
had
made
a
showing
of
particularized
need.
and
the
argument
was
made
then
in
the
foia
case
that
that
prior
order
demonstrates
that
the
document
shouldn't
be
withheld
because
it
had
been
ordered
disclosed
in
discovery.
the
court
said
no,
that
isn't
the
test.
the
question
is
whether
it
would
be
routinely
available,
not
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
made
available
upon
a
special
showing.
and
in
this
case,
the
only
times
that
the
defendant
sees
a
copy
of
his
presentence
report
are
where
congress
has
in
effect
deemed
him
to
have
made
a
special
showing.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
we
don't.
we
don't
take
that
absolute
position.
and
that
was
the
subject
of
our
filing
in
the
crooker
case.
and
we
continue
to
abide
by
that
position.
and
that's
the
se
are
agency
records.
we
do
acknowledge
that.
but
by
the
same
token,
we
think
that
the
parole
commission
is
not
obligated
to
turn
them
over
to
the
defendant--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
the
privacy
act
permits
an
agency
to
exempt
certain
systems
of
records
from
the
provisions
of
the
privacy
act.
and
in
this
case,
the
parole
commission
and
also
the
bureau
of
prisons
have
exempted
the
files
containing
the
presentence
report
from
the
private
access
provisions
of
the
privacy
act.
and
it
seems
to
us
to
be
quite
anomalous
if
the
defendant
has
no
private
right
of
access
under
the
privacy
act
which
was
designed
for
that
purpose,
that
he
should
be
able
to
invoke
the
public
access
provisions
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
obtain
a
copy
of
the
report.
and
going
back
to
the
question
you
asked,
justice
o'connor,
it
seems
to
us
that
where
the
document
really
has
a
dual
status,
it's
an
important
essential
document
for
the
court
and
an
essential
document
for
the
agency,
it
makes
no
sense
for
the
parole
commission,
either
voluntarily
or
for
it
to
have
to
under
foia
to
disclose
a
document
that
the
court
would
not
disclose.
and
therefore
the
parole
commission
has
tried
to
reach
a
harmonious
approach
in
this
area,
whereby
it
will
not
release
a
copy
of
the
presentence
report
to
the
defendant
if
the
court
wouldn't
do
it.
otherwise,
they
would
be
working
at
cross
purposes.
and
there's
no
indication
at
all
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
parole
act
that
that
was
somehow
prohibited
to
the
parole
commission,
that
it
had
to
routinely
dispense
with
the
confidentiality
of
reports.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
no.
i
mean,
the
test
is
whether
he
would
have
a
special
need
for
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
relevant
but
the
question--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
it's
quite
clear
that
presentence
reports
are
not
generally
available.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
what
might
happen
is
that
the
court
might
readily
find
that
he
has
a
special
interest
in
it,
and
a
special
need
to
see
it
because
the
litigation
relates
directly
to
the
presentence
report.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
because
that
directly
parallels
his
right
to
read
the
report
at
sentencing
and
again
prior
to
his
parole
hearing.
congress
determined
that
because
the
presentence
report
is
the
basic
document,
he
has
a
special
need
to
see
it.
but
he
can't
keep
it.
he
has
to
give
it
back
again.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
his
special
need
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
he
presentence
report
is
placed
in
issue
in
the
case
concerning
him
in
particular.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
might
have
a
suit
against
the
parole
commission
or
the
bureau
of
prisons
that
does
not
relate
to
his
presentence
report.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
might
still
be
relevant,
and
even
under
the
civil
discovery
rules,
it
doesn't
have
to
necessarily
be
admissible.
it
just
has
to
perhaps
lead
to
other
information.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
court
might
well
take
that
into
account
in
deciding
whether
the
defendant
should
be
able
to
see
it.
but
i
would
expect
for
example
in
a
case
like
that
that
the
court
again
would
not
just
hand
him
a
copy
of
the
report.
i
think
the
court
would
probably
parallel
what
happened
before
when
the
defendant
tried
to
see
the
report.
let
him
read
it,
let
his
lawyer
in
this
private
civil
suit
read
it,
but
not
let
him
retain
a
copy
of
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
it
was
an
exhibit
in
the
lawsuit,
then
the
court
would
be
deciding
that
it
should
be
admitted,
but
in
terms
of
discovery.
and
all
we're
talking
about
is
handing
it
over
to
the
defendant.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
the
question
is
turning
over
the
document
itself.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
the
difference
between
the
hard
copy
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
are
several
considerations
here.
first
in
terms
of
what
it
could
mean
to
the
defendant
if
he
has
the
entire
hard
copy
of
the
report.
as
the
administrative
office
stated
in
its
submission
to
the
parole
commission,
he
has
all
the
information
at
his
finger
tips.
he
can
brood
about
it,
he
can
pore
over
it,
he
can
look
for
things
that
may
be
wrong
or
look
for
persons
to
retaliate
against.
that's
much
different
than
simply
having
a
recollection
of
something
he
might
have
read.
beyond
this,
if
he
has
an
actual
copy
of
the
report,
there's
no
inhibition
against
his
handing
the
report
out
to
third
parties.
and
this
was
again
one
of
the
principal
concerns
that
the
administrative
office
explained
to
the
parole
commission
on
behalf
of
the
judges
who
are
part
of
the
probation
committee
of
the
judicial
conference,
and
also
on
behalf
of
probation
officers.
they
were
afraid
that
sources
of
information
would
be
more
reluctant
to
cooperate
with
a
probation
officer
if
the
formal
embodiment
of
their
comments
were
freely
distributed
to
third
parties.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
principle
under
exemption
5
is
a
general
one
that
this
court
has
stated
on
three
or
four
occasions.
it's
stated
in
weber
aircraft
and
in
sears.
the
test
is
whether
whatever
the
privilege
is,
whether
it
would
be
routinely
available
or
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh,
there
is.
there
is
a
governmental
privilege.
it's
actually
quite
similar
to
the
machin
privilege
in
weber
aircraft
which
is
a
privilege
to
maintain
the
confidentiality
of
the
information
to
encourage
sources
to
cooperate
with
the
government.
that
privilege
applies
to
the
subject
of
the
report
as
well
as
to
third
parties.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
declined
to
release
their
own
copies
of
presentence
reports
to
people
who
want
them
precisely
for
use
in
pending
litigation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
practices
vary
from
district
to
district.
in
some
cases,
as
i
understand
it,
the
defendant
looks
at
it
in
chambers
and
the
judge
may
be
present.
in
others,
it's
furnished
to
him
at
the
probation
office
where
the
probation
officer
may
or
may
not
be
present.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
some
districts
would
give
it
to
the
defense
counsel
and
allow
the
defense
counsel
to
arrange
for
the
way
in
which
it
would
be
disclosed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
necessarily
because
there's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
and
not
just
show
it
but
distribute
it.
he
might
show
it
to
someone,
he
might
distribute
it.
sources
of
confidential
information
they
might
feel
much
more
secure
if
they
knew
that
the
presentence
report
was
going
to
remain
confidential
as
opposed
to
being
distributed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
confidential
not
just
from
the
defendant
but
to
the
world
at
large.
and
if
you
give
a
copy--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he
can
but
there's
a
big
difference
as
far
as
the
probation
officers
are
concerned,
as
far
as
they
see
it
from
the
defendant
being
able
to
show
an
actual
copy
and
just
being
able
to
recount
what
his
recollection
is.
frankly,
there's
a
greater
deniability
on
the
part
of
sources
of
information
if
the
defendant
does
not
have
an
actual
hard
copy.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
a
foia
case,
the
test
is
not
whether
the
privilege
that
is
recognized
elsewhere
is
thought
to
be
wise
or
not.
foia
takes
the
privileges
as
they
are
found,
and
applies
them
through
exemption
5,
and
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
exemption
5
does
incorporate
the
privilege.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
several
points
i'd
like
to
make.
first,
the
privilege
at
issue
here
is
not
a
privacy
privilege
as
respondents
repeatedly
suggest.
the
reason
why,
and
we
point
this
out
in
our
reply
brief
and
a
number
of
cases
say
this,
the
reason
why
courts
do
not
disclose
presentence
reports
to
parties
seeking
to
discover
them
in
litigation
is
not
the
privacy
of
the
defendant,
that
may
be
subsumed.
the
overreaching
rational
is
the
governmental
interest,
governmental
privilege
in
protecting
the
free
flow
of
information
to
the
government,
to
the
probation
officers.
rationale
applies
equally
to
giving
a
copy
of
the
report
to
the
subject
of
the
report
as
it
does
to
third
parties.
also,
the
nature
of
the
privilege
requires
that
it
be
as
absolute
as
possible,
so
that
the
sources
of
information
will
have
confidence
that
their
information
will
be
tightly
held.
and
in
fact,
as
the
administrative
office
pointed
out
to
the
parole
commission
in
the
rulemaking
proceeding,
sources
of
information
are
specifically
told
that
their
information
will
be
only
shown
to
the
defendant
and
not
made
available
to
third
parties.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it's
but
that's
true
of
a
lot
of
privileges.
the
government
may
choose
not
to.
and
related
to
that
is
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
make.
respondents
make
something
of
the
point
that
the
cases
we
rely
on
refer
to
disclosures
by
the
sentencing
court,
and
not
the
parole
commission,
and
somehow
they
are
different
considerations
or
different
uses
by
the
parole
commission.
first
of
all,
the
use
is
essentially
the
same.
the
presentence
report
is
the
essential
document
on
which
the
sentencing
decision
is
made,
the
parole
decision
is
made
and
incarceration
decisions
are
made.
but
beyond
that,
the
purposes
of
the
privilege
are
precisely
the
same
in
both
contexts.
the
purpose
of
the
privilege
is
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
document
by
securing
the
information
from
the
sources.
that
purpose
applies
equally
to
whether
disclosure
is
made
by
the
parole
commission
or
by
the
sentencing
court,
and
in
fact,
the
probation
officer
makes
the
report
for
the
parole
commission
as
well
as
the
sentencing
court.
the
third
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
respondents
are
arguing
for
an
exception
to
a
general
privilege
under
exemption
5
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
an
exemption
which
they
essentially
concede
applies
to
members
of
the
public.
exemption
5
as
judge
wald
said
in
her
dissenting
opinion
in
durns
permits
no
such
distinction
between
the
requesters
unlike
exemption
6.
but
more
importantly,
if
there
was
any
doubt
about
the
existence
of
a
special
exemption,
it's
dispelled
by
rule
32(c)
in
which
congress
focused
on
the
precise
question
here,
whether
the
subject
of
the
report
has
a
right
or
should
have
a
right
to
get
it,
respondent's
position
would
completely
undermine
that
decision.
