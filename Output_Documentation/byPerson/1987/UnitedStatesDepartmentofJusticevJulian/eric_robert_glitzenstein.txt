mr.
eric
robert
glitzenstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
much
of
the
government's
argument
seems
to
be
contending
that
unless
congress
has
in
some
way
required
it
in
a
statute
other
than
the
freedom
of
information
act
that
presentence
reports
be
disclosed
to
prisoners
who
are
otherwise
entitled
to
see
them
before
sentencing
and
parole
hearings,
that
it
needn't
provide
copies
of
those
reports.
but
that
stands
the
entire
concept
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
on
its
head.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
foia
was
to
essentially
require
the
government
to
make
available
to
requesters
federal
agency
records,
unless
the
government
can
point
to
a
specific
exemption
which
authorizes
the
government
to
withhold
that
information.
we
would
submit
that
it
is
quite
plain
that
neither
of
the
two
exemptions
relied
upon
by
the
government
here,
exemptions
3
or
5,
are
applicable
to
requests
by
the
subjects
of
presentence
reports
for
copies
of
material
they
have
already
been
permitted
to
see
pursuant
to
not
one
but
two
statutory
directives.
mr.
eric
robert
glitzenstein
your
honor,
i
believe
that
exemption
6
was
crafted
to
deal
precisely
with
the
distinction
between
first
party
and
third
party
requests.
the
phraseology
of
that
exemption
states
that
information
shall
not
be
released,
or
may
not
be
released
if
in
fact
the
disclosure
of
the
information
would
create
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
i
would
submit
it
is
quite
plain
that
when
personal
information
is
released
to
the
individual
who
is
the
subject
of
the
information,
there
cannot
in
the
language
of
the
exemption
be
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
however,
if
a
third
party
seeks
access
to
that
information,
there
may
very
well
be
an
invasion
of
personal
privacy
subject
to
that
particular
exemption.
mr.
eric
robert
glitzenstein
i
think
again,
it
would
depend
upon
an
analysis
of
the
particular
exemption
involved.
for
example,
if
one
were
dealing
with
confidential
sources,
then
one
would
look
at
whether
congress
has
in
some
way
exempted
confidential
source
information
not
only
from
the
defendant
but
from
the
world
at
large.
and
we
would
submit
that
it's
quite
clear,
as
we
have
conceded
in
this
case,
and
i
think
as
two
circuit
courts
have
now
held,
the
confidential
source
material
clearly
can
be
withheld
not
only
from
the
defendant
but
from
the
rest
of
the
world
as
well.
mr.
eric
robert
glitzenstein
i
believe
that's
basically
our
argument,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
conceivable
if
i
might
just
amend
that
partially
that
there
could
be
in
some
instances
a
governmental
privilege.
i
don't
think
one
exists
here,
that
protects
disclosure
from
third
parties
but
not
necessarily
from
first
parties,
depending
upon
the
kind
of
governmental
interest
that
was
being
articulated.
i
don't
think
this
qualifies
as
such
a
privilege
as
i
will
indicate
in
my
remarks
in
a
moment.
but
i
think
it's
conceivable
that
justice
exemption
6
may
turn
on
whether
the
exemption
would
apply
depending
upon
who
the
requester
is,
it
is
conceivable
that
there
is
privileges
that
are
crafted
by
the
courts
for
discovery
proceedings
could
turn
on
the
nature
of
the
requester.
but
i
would
say
as
a
general
rule
that
you're
absolutely
right
that
release
of
information
to
one
party
would
involve
release
of
information
to
the
world
at
large.
i
just
have
a
few
remarks
about
the
exemption
3
claim.
because
i
believe
it
helps
to
put
in
perspective
why
the
government
is
really
overreaching
in
this
case
in
an
effort
to
argue
that
these
particular
documents
are
exempt
from
their
subjects.
as
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
exemption
3
was
amended
in
1976
for
the
precise
purpose
of
very
carefully
narrowing
the
kinds
of
statutory
schemes
that
would
qualify
as
withhold
statutes
under
the
particular
exemption.
as
it
is
now
crafted,
as
mr.
kneedler
pointed
out,
it
only
covers
information
that
specifically
is
exempted
from
disclosure
by
statute
providing
that
the
statute
either
a)
requires
that
the
matter
be
withheld
from
the
public
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
no
discretion
on
the
issue,
or
b)
establishes
particular
criteria
for
withholding
or
refers
to
particular
types
of
materials
to
be
withheld.
in
crafting
that
language,
the
legislative
history
of
the
amendment
makes
it
quite
clear...
and
this
is
how
it's
been
largely
construed
by
the
courts...
particular
documents
cannot
be
withheld
unless
congress
has
in
some
way
told
an
agency
how
to
exercise
its
discretion
in
order
to
release
or
withhold
that
information.
and
thus
where
a
statute
does
not
tell
an
agency
in
some
way
to
withhold
material
from
a
requester,
the
exemption
does
not
apply.
we
would
submit
in
this
case
it
is
quite
clear
that
as
to
three
specific
categories
of
information
which
are
sometimes
contained
in
presentence
reports,
congress
made
that
determination
quite
explicit.
and
thus
under
section
4208(c)
of
the
parole
act,
the
parole
commission
is
authorized
to
withhold
from
everyone,
including
subjects
of
the
reports,
material
revealing
sources
of
confidentiality
obtained
under
a
promise
of
confidentiality
as
well
as
two
other
specific
categories
of
information.
that
clearly
reflects
congress'
judgment
that
that
kind
of
information
could
occasion
some
harm
if
released.
it
is
just
as
clear
that
as
to
other
portions
of
presentence
reports
which
may
otherwise
be
shown
to
the
prisoner,
then
there
is
no
harm
that
congress
foresaw
in
the
disclosure
of
that
information,
and
it
did
not
direct
the
parole
commission
to
decline
to
release
that
particular
information.
in
fact,
the
chairman
of
the
parole
commission
has
himself
recognized
that
in
various
documents
that
we
have
included
in
our
brief,
as
well
as
documents
attached
to
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
eric
robert
glitzenstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
rule
32(c)(3)(e)
specifically
gives
the
courts
the
authority
to
disclose
copies,
or
i
think
in
the
language
of
that
provision,
to
require
return
to
the
court.
but
i
think
that
helps
our
case
here.
because
congress
did
not
adopt
that
provision
when
it
enacted
the
provisions
of
the
parole
act.
tellingly,
it
adopted
virtually
every
other
portion
of
rule
32(c)
verbatim,
when
it
enacted
the
parole
act,
including
almost
precise
parallels
for
the
three
categories
of
data
including
confidential
sources
that
may
be
withheld.
but
it
did
not
include
the
requirement
that
is
contained
in
rule
32(c)(3)(e).
the
conclusion
seems
inescapable
therefore
that
that
was
a
purposeful
deliberate
determination
by
congress
to
essentially
authorize
the
parole
commission
to
release
copies
of
the
reports.
and
as
the
chairman
of
the
parole
commission
himself
has
said,
the
fact
that
the
parole
commission
is
authorized
to
withhold
confidential
sources
suggests
that
in
response
to
foia
requests,
"in
cases
where
there
is
confidential
material
which
is
not
to
be
shown
to
the
defendant,
such
material
can
be
withheld
under
the
foia,
as
well.
"
he
went
on
to
say
that
giving
prisoners
copies
of
presentence
reports
that
they
have
already
been
permitted
to
read
will
pose,
"no
threat
to
the
willingness
of
confidential
sources
to
come
forward
because
the
probation
officer
can
still
guarantee
confidentiality
under
the
foia.
"
mr.
eric
robert
glitzenstein
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
just
emphasize
that
i
think
that
clearly
is
what
congress
did
both
in
the
plain
language
of
the
two
statutes
by
not
adopting
rule
32(c)(3)(e)
and
in
legislative
history
of
the
parole
act
where
it
authorized
independent
determinations.
mr.
eric
robert
glitzenstein
i
think
the
reason
it
makes
sense
is
when
you
look
at
the
purpose
of
rule
32(c)
was
essentially
to
give
the
court
control
over
that
document
up
until
the
end
of
the
sentencing
process.
there
have
been
cases
from
this
court
including
williams
v.
new
york,
other
cases
which
have
talked
about
the
need
for
the
sentencing
judge
to
supervise
the
sentencing
process.
and
i
think
what
congress
was
saying
was
that
up
until
the
sentencing
judge
completes
sentencing,
then
the
sentencing
judge
could
essentially
exercise
that
kind
of
supervision
and
control
over
all
of
the
documents
that
come
before
the
judge
and
are
used
in
the
sentencing
process,
perhaps
to
prevent
unnecessary
delay
if
he
believes
that
a
particular
defendant
will
take
the
presentence
report
and
do
things
with
it
that
the
judge
may
not
like.
but
whatever
the
reasons,
what
i
think
congress
was
doing
was
splitting
this
up
and
saying,
up
until
the
time
of
sentencing
you
are
using
the
report
exclusively,
and
you
can
keep
control
of
the
materials
that
are
being
used.
but
once
it
goes
to
correctional
authorities
and
it
takes
on
entirely
different
kind
of
significance
and
is
used
in
totally
distinct
kinds
of
determinations,
then
we
want
the
federal
statutes,
including
the
parole
act
and
other
relevant
statutes
to
kick
in
and
to
control
the
way
in
which
these
reports
are
used
and
disseminated.
and
i
think
in
keeping
that
in
mind,
it's
crucial
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
presentence
reports
are
not
only
used
in
parole
determinations
by
the
parole
commission,
but
as
our
brief
points
out,
they
are
used
in
a
whole
host
of
correctional
decisions
the
second
that
that
prisoner
walks
through
institutional
doors.
it's
used
to
determine
the
kind
of
institution
that
person
will
be
put
in,
the
nature
of
the
security
that
will
be
imposed,
furloughs,
what
sorts
of
rehabilitation
and
correctional
systems
will
be
put
into
place.
virtually
every
aspect
of
the
prisoner's
day
to
day
life
will
be
impacted
perhaps
by
the
presentence
report.
and
what
congress
was
saying
was
since
that
is
the
case
we
do
not
want
the
sentencing
court
and
its
use
of
this
report
and
control
of
the
report
under
rule
32(c)
to
have
a
continuing
bearing
upon
what
the
parole
commission
does
with
that
document
and
what
other
correctional
authorities
do
with
that
document.
mr.
eric
robert
glitzenstein
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
again,
i
think
that
congress
did
focus
on
the
need
of
the
particular
defendant
in
passing
the
parole
act,
where
congress
specifically
required
that
the
document
be
made
available
to
the
prisoner,
it
did
not
impose
any
limitations.
but
secondly,
and
i
think
the
more
general
answer
is,
the
exemptions
to
the
foia
apply
to
any
federal
agency
record
that
a
federal
agency
happens
to
have
ink
its
possession.
and
the
government
has
conceded
since
the
crooker
case
that
these
presentence
reports
are
federal
agency
records.
and
therefore
the
only
way
to
analyze
pursuant
to
congressional
intent,
whether
the
document
may
be
withheld
in
a
particular
circumstance,
is
by
analyzing
whether
a
specific
exemption
might
apply.
and
as
i
mentioned
before
when
one
is
looking
at
giving
out
documents
of
this
nature
to
the
world
at
large,
then
congress
intended
the
exemption
6
privacy
analysis
to
be
the
kind
of
test
that
would
be
applied
by
courts
in
applying
the
foia
exemptions.
and
just
like
any
other
personal
information
that
might
be
involved
in
any
determination
made
by
an
agency,
medical
records,
social
security
records,
veterans
administration
records,
the
exemption
6
test
was
crafted
for
precisely
that
purpose.
and
i
think
that
is
the
way
in
which
courts
should
analyze
this
kind
of
case
as
well
as
other
kinds
of
cases
in
which
an
individual
may
be
permitted
to
obtain
access
to
some
material,
but
the
world
at
large
would
not
necessarily
be
in
a
position
to
do
so.
mr.
eric
robert
glitzenstein
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
some
lower
courts
have
in
some
instances
withheld
copies
of
presentence
reports
from
third
parties
trying
to
obtain
them
from
sentencing
courts.
and
i
think
that
it
is
very
important
to
look
carefully
at
what
those
courts
said.
because
it
is
useful
in
analyzing
why
grolier,
why
weber,
and
the
other
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
under
exemption
5
are
inapplicable.
in
those
cases,
the
courts
began
their
analysis,
and
again,
this
is
sentencing
courts,
usually
codefendants
were
attempting
to
obtain
copies
of
other
peoples'
presentence
reports
by
specifically
saying,
that
the
usual
rule
when
a
defendant
is
trying
to
obtain
his
or
her
own
presentence
report
is
created
by
rule
32
and
the
parole
act,
and
first
parties
ordinarily
permitted
to
obtain
copies
of
their
presentence
reports
without
showing
any
special
need,
without
demonstrating
that
they
have
any
overriding
interest
in
obtaining
that
information
just
by
showing
that
it's
relevant
to
the
proceedings.
then
those
courts,
and
again,
i'm
referring
precisely
to
the
cases
that
are
cited
by
the
government,
figurski,
hancock,
charmer
industries,
go
on
to
say
that
because
rule
32
and
the
parole
act
do
not
say
anything
about
third
party
access,
then
we,
the
sentencing
courts,
must
craft
our
own
rules.
and
in
crafting
our
own
discovery
rules,
we
will
take
a
number
of
factors
into
account.
one
of
the
factors
we
will
take
into
account,
as
those
cases
indicate,
is
the
court's
desire
to
exercise
control
over
the
documents,
because
we
deem
them
to
be
court
records
and
that
they
will
stay
court
records.
in
that
connection,
i
think
it's
useful
to
quote
from
charmer
industries,
one
of
the
cases
principally
relied
upon
by
the
government,
which
says,
right
at
the
outset,
that
notwithstanding
any
secondary
uses,
the
presentence
report
is
a
court
document
and
is
to
be
used
by
non-judicial
federal
officials
and
others
only
with
permission
of
the
court.
went
on
to
say
that
in
light
of
the
nature
of
the
presentence
report
as
a
court
document,
designed
and
treated
principally
as
an
aid
to
the
court,
we
conclude
it
would
not
properly
be
disclosable
without
authorization
by
the
court
to
third
parties.
i
think
two
things
become
quite
clear.
one
is
that
if
there
is
any
kind
of
recognition
of
confidentiality,
it
involves
third-parties
and
not
first
parties.
and
secondly,
those
cases
are
in
large
measure
dependent
upon
an
argument
which
the
parole
commission
now
concedes
it
is
no
longer
making.
and
that
is
the
sentencing
courts'
continuing
control
over
the
materials.
in
essence,
what
the
parole
commission
is
doing
is
using
cases
which
recognize
perhaps
a
certain
kind
of
confidentiality
but
with
very
precise
contours
and
based
upon
certain
presuppositions
and
saying,
we
are
going
to
take
those
cases
and
expand
the
privilege
far
beyond
the
contours
that
those
cases
themselves
recognized.
that
is,
in
cases
involving
first
parties
as
opposed
to
third
parties,
and
in
cases
involving
parole
commission
discovery
proceedings
as
opposed
to
situations
where
the
sentencing
court
is
itself
the
party
in
control.
mr.
eric
robert
glitzenstein
there
are
cases
i
know
that
have
indicated
that
presentence
reports
may
upon
a
substantial
showing
of
need
be
disclosed.
i
cannot
recall
whether
those
were
after
sentencing
or
before
sentencing.
in
some
of
these
cases,
as
i
indicated--
mr.
eric
robert
glitzenstein
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
every
court
which
has
looked
at
third
party
access
has
said
that
in
order
to
give
out
a
presentence
report
to
a
third
party,
there
must
be
some
demonstration
of
specialized
need.
again,
the
reasons
why
the
court
said
that
are
totally
inapposite
here.
one
reason
being
the
control
of
the
sentencing
court
over
the
document
forever,
and
the
second
reason
being
the
need
to
protect
privacy
of
the
subject
of
the
report.
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
courts
will
be
reluctant
to
give
these
documents
out
because
they
are
so
personal.
and
because
they
have
so
much
sensitive
information
about
the
defendant
to
give
them
out
to
third
parties
without
a
substantial
showing
of
need.
by
the
same
token,
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
has
specifically
said
that
when
you
have
first
parties,
there
need
be
no
showing
of
need.
,--
in
fact,
the
case
we
cite
in
our
brief,
which
i
think
answers
mr.
kneedler's
arguments
quite
effectively
is
rone
v.
united
states,
a
seventh
circuit
case,
in
which
the
court
reviewed
amendments
to
rule
32(c),
as
well
as
the
parole
act
that
was
adopted
in
1976
and
said
these
cases
not
only
give
prisoners
a
right
to
get
access
to
these
documents
by
initiating
an
foia
request,
they
go
even
further
than
that.
they
impose
an
affirmative
duty
on
sentencing
courts
and
on
the
parole
commission
to
come
to
the
defendant
and
say,
this
is
material
that
we
may
very
well
rely
upon
in
making
a
sentencing
determination
or
in
making
a
parole
decision,
and
therefore,
you
have
a
right
to
see
that
document.
so
these
cases
go
beyond
the
routinely
available
standard
in
that
sense.
they
in
fact
declare,
as
well
as
the
statutes
that
congress
crafted,
that
prisoners
and
defendants
have
an
affirmative
right
to
have
these
documents
made
available
to
them.
and
it
is
therefore
difficult
for
us
to
see
how
the
government
can
argue
that
these
are
not
routinely
available
to
prisoners
in
discovery
proceedings.
the
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
or
one
of
the
final
points
i'd
like
to
make
about
the
government's
analysis,
is
that
it
would
cut
against
the
grain
of
what
this
court
said
in
the
federal
open
market
committee
v.
merrill
case.
in
which
this
court
in
the
process
of
recognizing
a
certain
kind
of
discovery
privilege,
stated
that
it
would,
"hesitate
to
construe
exemption
5
to
incorporate
a
civil
discovery
privilege
that
would
substantially
duplicate
another
foia
exemption.
"
here,
it
is
quite
clear
that
any
conceivable
interest
the
government
has
in
withholding
these
documents
is
adequately,
more
than
adequately
met
by
other
exemptions.
as
i
noted
above,
we
concede
the
ninth
circuit
held,
the
first
circuit
has
held,
that
confidential
source
material
constitutes
an
exemption
3
statute
under
the
parole
act,
and
can
be
withheld.
by
the
same
token,
any
legitimate
privacy
interest
clearly
could
be
met
through
the
contours
of
exemption
6,
and
by
applying
that
exemption.
and
so
it's
also
quite
possible
that
other
exemptions
would
apply
to
specific
portions
of
the
reports.
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
government's
presentence
report
privilege
is
certainly
not
needed
because
of
the
other
foia
exemptions.
in
addition,
it
would
do
something
that
would
have
very
untoward
effects
on
exemption
6
and
the
rest
of
the
foia.
in
effect
what
it
would
do
as
we
read
their
approach
to
exemption
5,
is
prevent
individuals
from
ever
using
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
obtain
their
own
personal
information,
because
the
more
sensitive,
the
more
personal
the
information,
it
seems
quite
clear
the
more
the
government
would
be
able
to
argue
that
it
is
note
quote
unquote
routinely
available
to
third
parties
in
discovery
proceedings.
and
that
could
then
be
used
under
exemption
5
to
prevent
first
parties
from
obtaining
access
to
their
own
reports
and
their
own
documents.
and
in
that
connection,
i
think
it's
quite
important
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
congress
itself
saw
the
foia
as
a
tool
for
obtaining
first
party
information,
that
is,
individuals
getting
their
own
records.
contrary
to
the
suggestion
by
mr.
kneedler,
congress
did
not
only
look
at
the
privacy
act
as
the
vehicle
for
obtaining
first
party
information.
in
fact,
in
1984,
congress
amended
the
privacy
act
for
the
specific
purpose
of
saying
that
just
because
information
is
not
exempt
under
the
privacy
act
does
not
mean
it
would
not
be
available
under
the
foia.
and
the
legislative
history
says
we
see
both
of
these
statutes
in
appropriate
circumstances
as
vehicles
for
obtaining
personal
information.
mr.
eric
robert
glitzenstein
your
honor,
i
think
if
one
looks
at
the
classic
exemption
5
privileges
which
the
courts
early
on
incorporated
into
the
exemption
and
the
ones
that
are
highlighted
in
the
legislative
history,
one
would
have
to
come
out
a
different
way
on
that.
because,
for
example,
deliberative
process
privilege,
which
specifically
was
designed
to
protect
drafts,
working
papers,
other
kinds
of
documents
shedding
light
on
the
deliberative
process,
i
think
much
of
that
material,
and
the
courts
have
made
it
clear
that
much
of
that
material
would
not
necessarily
be
withholdable
under
other
foia
exemptions.
by
the
same
token,
attorney
client
material,
attorney
work
product
doctrine
material,
the
two
other
core
privileges
that
the
courts
have
incorporated
into
exemption
5,
i
cannot
see
how
those
would
for
the
most
part
be
withholdable
under
other
exemptions.
and
so
i
think
it
is
quite
consistent
with
congress'
intent
to
see
whether
or
not
a
particular
withholding
that
the
government
is
interested
in
really
goes
to
those
kinds
of
core
governmental
interests
that
could
not
be
protected
under
other
exemptions.
because
as
this
court
said
in
federal
open
market
committee
v.
merrill,
congress
drafted
other
exemptions
of
the
foia
for
the
precise
purpose
of
incorporating
certain
other
kinds
of
discovery
privileges
which
were
known
to
criminal
and
civil
discovery.
and
therefore,
it
would
really
subvert
the
whole
purpose
of
congress
drafting
those
other
specific
exemptions
to
lock
stock
and
barrel
put
everything
into
exemption
5.
in
a
sense,
i
think
the
government's
argument
threatens
to
really
sweep
up
all
those
other
exemptions
and
to
either
make
them
irrelevant
or
worse,
to
essentially
undercut
the
kinds
of
tests
for
example
under
exemption
6
that
congress
really
wanted
the
courts
to
apply
in
making
those
kinds
of
determinations.
and
so
i
think
that
the
only
way
really
to
avoid
that
kind
of
hazard
in
really
reading
the
rest
of
the
exemptions
out
of
the
statute
is
by
doing
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
and
that
is
by
recognizing
that
congress
can
effectively
say
that
particular
documents
are
not
subject
a
discovery
privilege
and
that
particular
individuals
are
entitled
to
receive
access
to
those
documents,
and
thus
exemption
5
should
not
apply
to
those
materials.
the
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
involves
the
fact
that
the
government's
argument
under
exemption
5
reads
another
entire
area
of
the
law
out
of
discovery,
and
that
is
the
law
of
waiver.
the
notion
being
that
in
basic
discovery
cases
when
the
government
or
some
other
party
is
arguing
a
privilege
applies,
it
is
generally
held
that
when
your
forfeit
confidentiality
of
the
material,
then
you
are
no
longer
able
to
argue
that
that
information
should
be
withheld
from
a
party
in
subsequent
proceedings.
and
i
think
in
response
to
justice
marshall's
inquiries,
it
is
my
understanding
that
not
only
prisoners
and
their
lawyers
generally
allowed
to
look
at
these
documents,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
parole
commission
in
most
sentencing
courts
actually
allow
the
prisoners
and
their
attorneys
to
take
notes
from
the
copies
of
the
documents.
so
if
one
were
really
concerned
about
passing
along
information
of
that
nature
to
third
parties,
clearly
taking
verbatim
notes
from
the
copies
that
are
already
provided
the
prisoners
would
involve
that
kind
of
a
harm.
and
that
is
why
the
parole
commission
in
the
documents
that
we
cite
in
our
briefs
has
said
that
we
do
not
see
any
incremental
harm,
quite
frankly,
in
giving
out
copies
of
documents
that
prisoners
were
already
allowed
to
see
on
several
occasions
and
even
take
verbatim
notes
of.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest,
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
that
we
think
there
is
a
genuine
risk
that
prisoners
will
take
these
reports
and
given
them
out
to
the
world
at
large.
these
contain
very
sensitive
information
about
prisoners'
family
backgrounds,
psychological
characteristics,
and
there's
no
evidence
o
the
record
that
prisoners
are
simply
waiting
to
give
this
incredibly
sensitive
personal
information
out.
but
if
that
was
a
concern,
that
is
a
concern
which
this
particular
exemption
claim
would
not
do
anything
to
prevent.
as
a
result,
for
these
reasons,
we
believe
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct,
both
in
its
application
of
the
foia
exemptions,
and
its
determination
that
there
were
no
significant
governmental
interests
to
be
protected
by
withholding
copies
of
presentence
reports,
and
we
therefore
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
