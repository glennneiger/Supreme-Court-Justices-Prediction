chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
1357,
united
states
department
of
justice
versus
kenneth
michael
julian
and
margaret
j.
wallace.
mr.
kneedler,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
those
cases
where
the
defendant
after
incarceration
is
suing
to
get
some
change
in
his
status
and
requests
through
discovery
a
copy
of
this
report?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
one
would
think
though,
just
as
a
matter
of
off
the
top
of
the
head
so
to
speak,
that
if
the
sort
of
suit
was
brought
that
i
described,
that
probably
this
would
be
available
to
a
plaintiff
suing
the
government.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
why
shouldn't
that
defeat
exemption
5?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
nothing
is
routinely
handed
out
in
litigation.
i
mean,
you
have
to
go
through
the
discovery
process.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
are
you
saying
then
that
for
the
number
of
section
5
or
subsection
5
privilege
to
attach,
it's
enough
that
in
the
litigation
where
the
person
would
ultimately
obtain
discovery,
they
have
to
make
a
showing
that
they
need
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
as
i
glance
at
the
grolier
case,
it
looks
to
me
as
if
what
the
court
was
saying
there
was
where
you're
having
a
claim
of
work
product
privilege,
and
the
court
has
overcome
that
privilege
in
an
earlier
litigation.
that
does
not
mean
that
it's
routinely
available.
but
there
it's
very
much
of
a
case
by
case
thing.
you
know,
you
have
a
claim
of
work
product.
how
much
does
the
other
side
need
it.
and
here
i
don't
see
any
counterpart
to
the
work
product
privilege
that's
asserted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there
isn't
any
privilege
here
on
the
government's
side,
as
i
see
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
this
is
a
governmental
privilege
that's
recognized
in
litigation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
glitzenstein.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
glitzenstein,
do
you
concede
that
a
court
would
not
be
required
to
give
the
defendant
a
copy
under
rule
32?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
glitzenstein.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted,--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
no.
86-1357,
united
states
department
of
justice
versus
julian.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
prison
inmates
who
sued
the
government
under
the
foia,
freedom
of
information
act
for
disclosure
of
their
presentence
investigation
reports.
these
reports
are
prepared
by
a
probation
officer.
they
are
then
used
by
the
district
court
for
sentencing
and
transmitted
to
the
parole
commission
and
the
bureau
of
prisons.
the
issue
raised
by
this
case
is
whether
the
foia
requires
that
these
presentence
investigation
reports
be
disclosed
to
the
person
who
is
the
subject
of
the
report
or
whether
the
reports
instead
fall
under
one
of
the
act's
statutory
exemption.
for
the
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
conclude
that
the
reports
are
not
exempted
from
disclosure
by
either
exemption
3
or
exemption
5
of
the
foia.
and
accordingly,
they
must
be
disclosed
to
the
respondents.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
white
and
justice
o'connor
have
joined.
