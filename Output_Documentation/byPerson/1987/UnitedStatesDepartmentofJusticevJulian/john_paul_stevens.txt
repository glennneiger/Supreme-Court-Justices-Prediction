justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
ask
you
a
question.
supposing,
just
looking
at
the
language
of
exemption
5,
supposing
the
inmate
brought
some
kind
of
an
action
against
the
parole
commission
claiming
he
was
entitled
to
more
of
a
hearing
given
certain
information
based
on
certain
information
that
was
in
his
presentence
report,
and
that
the
presentence
report
was
clearly
relevant
to
the
charges
he
made,
and
that
what
he
needed
to
see
was
not
part
that
could
have
been
withheld
from
him
but
would
have
been
ordinarily
disclosed
to
him,
would
that
not
routinely
be
made
available
in
a
case
like
that?
justice
stevens
well,
the
need
is
it's
relevant
to
the
lawsuit,
that's
the
special
need.
justice
stevens
which
is
generally
the
test
in
any
discovery
proceeding,
it's
got
to
be
some
showing
of
relevance.
justice
stevens
but
also
you
don't
have
an
awful
lot
of
litigation
between
inmates
and
the
particular
agency
having
custody
of
it.
but
when
there
is
litigation
between
the
inmate
and
the
agency
and
it
relates
to
something
in
the
report
which
he
had
a
right
to
see
but
not
keep
earlier,
why
wouldn't
that
routinely
be
made
available.
that's
what
i
want
to
know?
justice
stevens
but
the
fact
that
it's
needed
in
litigation
would
in
those
facts
constitute
the
kind
of
special
need
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
stevens
the
special
need
arises
out
of
his
status
as
a
litigant.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
and
it
wouldn't
be
routinely
available
because
it
wasn't
relevant.
justice
stevens
i
just
can't
imagine
a
trial
judge
turning
down
a
request
to
see
a
report
that
he
had
a
right
to
see
earlier
in
a
discovery
situation.
justice
stevens
even
if
it
was
going
to
be
an
exhibit
in
the
lawsuit?
justice
stevens
well,
tell
me
something
else,
what
really
is
the
government
seeking
to
protect
from...
i
just
have
a
difficult
time
understanding
what
it
is
the
government
doesn't
want
to
turn
over
to
somebody
that
has
already
seen
the
material.
justice
stevens
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
stevens
or
making
a
xerox
copy.
but
what's
the
big
deal?
that's
what
i
don't
quite
understand.
