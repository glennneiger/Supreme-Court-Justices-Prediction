justice
stevens
i
must
confess
i
am
kind
of
puzzled.
why
wouldn't
that
have
given
them
adequate
information
about
the
size
of
the
tract?
justice
stevens
there
was
an
oral
statement
earlier
that
there
was
more
acreage.
is
that
it?
justice
stevens
less
than
1628?
justice
stevens
why
do
you
have
to
rely
on
an
oral
statement
about
1628?
that
is
in
the
written
documents.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it
surely
cleared
up
any...
i
mean,
it
surely
made
it
clear
that
that
is
the
amount
of
acreage
that
they
were
talking
about.
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand,
though,
why
he
has
to
rely
on
an
oral
statement.
justice
stevens
mr.
shockey,
before
you
get
into
the
legal
argument,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
facts?
is
the
agreement
of
october
3,
1980,
in
the
papers
before
us?
justice
stevens
i
can't
seem
to
find
it.
justice
stevens
it
is
in
the
record.
justice
stevens
does
it
contain
the
normal
boilerplate
that
all
prior
representations
are
merged
into
the
agreement
or
something
like
that?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
mr.
taranto,
why
aren't
those
policies
equally
implicated
by
fraud
in
the
execution?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
fdic,
does
it
really
make
any
difference
whether
the
facts
as
your
opponent
alleges
here,
or
just
changed
a
little
bit,
supposing
the
bank
president
wrote
up
an
agreement
with
the
different
sized
acreage
and
he
showed
it
to
him
and
says,
this
is
what
the
deal
is
going
to
be,
and
then
he
went
home
and
substituted
a
page
without
telling
him,
and
what
shows
up
in
the
files
is
what
we've
got.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
fdic,
why
is
one
any
more...
any
different
from
the
other?
justice
stevens
it
seems
ironic
to
say
that
the
use
of
the
actual
knowledge
doesn't
matter.
in
one
case
actual
knowledge
of
the
fdic
they
still
can
prevail.
the
other
case
they
don't
know
but
they
lose.
justice
stevens
he
had
the
opportunity
in
the
fraud
in
the
execution
case,
too.
justice
stevens
--i
am
just
repeating
what
the
chief
justice
asked
you
earlier.
do
you
think
congress
had
this
distinction
in
mind?
justice
stevens
or
in
the
statute.
