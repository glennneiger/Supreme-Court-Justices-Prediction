justice
scalia
mr.
shockey,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
saying
that
a
promise
is
an
agreement,
but
a
representation
of
present
fact
is
not
an
agreement.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
promise
is
any
more
literally
an
agreement
than
is
a
representation
of
present
fact.
if
you
want
to
really
be
technical
about
it,
an
agreement
requires
an
exchange
of
promises.
i
don't
know
why
the
fact
that
i
say
i
will
charge
you
so
much
interest
is
any
more
an
agreement
than
is
the
fact
that
i
say
the
land
has
so
many
acres.
justice
scalia
you
argue
that
the
promises
are
agreements,
right?
justice
scalia
well,
in
the
mortgage,
i
assume
the
representation
as
to
the
acreage
is:
a
representation
from
your
client
to
the
bank
rather
than
a
representation
from
the
bank
to
your
client.
justice
scalia
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
in
the
ordinary
mortgage,
if
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
acreage
and
it
is
less
than
indicated,
is
it
the
bank
that
is
somehow
responsible?
justice
scalia
and
the
mortgage,
by
the
way,
that
also
wouldn't
be
an
agreement,
either,
the
representation
as
to
what
the
acreage
is?
justice
scalia
a
mortgage
is
an
agreement,
certainly,
but
you
would
say
that
that
portion
of
the
mortgage
consisting
of
the
representation
that
there
are
so
many
acres
in
the
land,
that
is
not
an
agreement
in
and
of
itself?
justice
scalia
mr.
shockey,
tell
me
if
i
am
mistaken
about
what
you
are
saying.
in
the
ordinary
contract,
any
representation
of
a
material
fact
is
automatically
a
condition
on
the
performance
of
the
other
party.
if
that
representation
isn't
complied
with,
the
other
party
doesn't
have
to
perform.
now,
you
can...
if
you
make
a
representation
and
don't
express
the
condition,
the
condition
is
implied
anyway.
it
simply
is
implied
in
fact.
now,
suppose
the
condition
in
this
case
had
been
expressed,
and
instead
of
just
saying,
the
banks
just
saying
the
land
contains
so
many
acres,
the
bank
says,
i
agree
that
if
the
land
does
not
contain
so
many
acres,
you
will
have
no
obligation
under
this
contract.
would
that
be
an
agreement?
justice
scalia
so
the
only
failure
here
is,
what
distinguishes
an
agreement
from
a
nonagreement
is
spelling
out
the
condition
that
exists
anyway,
whether
you
spell
it
out
or
not.
that
is
the
line
you
would
have
us
draw?
justice
scalia
more
precisely,
you
say
it
means
only
express
promises,
because
when
you
make
a
representation
of
a
material
fact,
there
is
an
implied
promise
that
the
deal
is
off
if
that
fact
isn't
true.
what
you
are
saying
is
that
an
agreement
consists
only
of
an
express
promise
and
not
of
an
implied
promise.
justice
scalia
i
sell
you
a
car
and
i
say
the
car
has...
i
say,
i
warrant,
this
car
has
eight
cylinders.
if
it
doesn't
have
eight
cylinders,
it
turns
out
to
have
four,
you
could
rescind
the
transaction
because
there
is
implicit
in
that
representation
a
promise
that
if
it
doesn't
have
eight
cylinders
you
can
get
out
of
the
transaction.
what
you
are
saying
here
is
that
unless
that
promise
is
made
express,
it
is
not
an
agreement.
if
it
is
express,
i
promise
that
if
it
doesn't
have
eight
you
can
get
out
of
the
transaction,
if
i
make
that
express,
you
say
it
is
an
agreement,
but
if
i
leave
it
to
be
implied,
it
is
not
an
agreement.
justice
scalia
but
you
are
claiming
that
that
representation
goes
to,
goes
to
the
validity
of
the
deal
between
your
client
and
the
bank.
you
are
saying
it
has
something
to
do
with
that
deal
and
was
part
of
that
transaction
as
well,
wasn't
it?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
injecting
fraud
into
the
analysis
all
of
a
sudden.
whether
it
is
an
agreement
or
not
depends
upon
the
presence
of
fraud?
you
can
have
a
fraudulent
promise.
there
can
be
fraud
in
a
transaction
that
consists
of
making
a
promise
at
the
outset
that
you
have
no
intention
whatever
to
perform.
justice
scalia
and
you
think
that
that
prevents
it,
that
would
prevent
it
from
being
an
agreement
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute?
justice
scalia
well,
then,
why
have
you
waived
your
rights
on
those
other
two?
i
thought
originally
those
promissory
elements
you
contested
as
not
being
agreements,
i
thought
on
this
appeal
you
have
acknowledge
that
they
are
agreements.
justice
scalia
well,
you
would
most
like
us
to
say,
then,
that
any
fraud,
whether
it
is
promissory
fraud
or
fraud
in
a
representation,
which
is
not
an
express
promise,
any
fraud
can't
constitute
an
agreement,
and
failing
that
you
would
fall
back
on
the
fact
that
at
least
an
implied
promise
is
not
an
agreement.
is
that--
justice
scalia
mr.
taranto,
can
a
fraudulent
promise,
a
promise
that
the
promisor
has
no
intention
of
performing,
can
that
constitute
fraud
in
the
inducement?
justice
scalia
i
understand,
but
my
point
is
that
even
if
we
accept
the
interpretation
of
the
word
"agreement"
that
the
petitioner
would
have
us
adopt,
we
would
not
have
succeeded
in
establishing
fraud
in
the
inducement
as
a
defense.
justice
scalia
--one
of
the
conditions
to
establish
fraud
in
the
execution,
as
i
recall,
is
that
the
person
asserting
it
not
have
had
an
opportunity
to
detect
a
fraud.
that
is,
he
can't
come
in
and
say,
you
know,
the
agreement
that
was
presented
to
me
was
not
the
one
i
thought
i
was
signing.
the
court
would
simply
say,
you
know,
was
it
given
to
you,
and
were
you
given
an
opportunity
to
read
it,
and
if
he
said
yes
fraud
in
the
execution
wouldn't
apply,
would
it?
there
has
to
be
some
chicanery
that
deprives
him
of
the
opportunity
to
see
what
he
is
executing.
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
way
of
accommodating.
am
i
right
on
the
law?
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
here
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
12
u.s.c.
section
1823(e)
provides
that
no
agreement
maybe
asserted
to
diminish
the
right
title
or
interest
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
in
an
asset
unless
the
agreement
is
1)
in
writing;
2)
executed
contemporaneously
with
the
insured
bank's
acquisition
of
that
interest;
3)
approved
in
the
minutes
of
the
bank's
board
of
directors
or
loan
committee;
and
4)
continuously
from
its
execution,
an
official
record
of
the
bank.
the
petitioners
here
executed
a
note
payable
to
an
fdic
insured
bank
in
consideration
for
a
loan
which
they
used
to
purchase
real
estate.
when
the
bank
sued
for
payment
of
the
note,
the
petitioners
asserted
as
a
defense
that
the
bank
had
procured
the
note
by
misrepresenting
the
amount
of
the
land
and
the
mineral
acres
it
contained
in
the
absence
of
outstanding
mineral
leases.
no
references
to
this
representations
appeared
in
the
documents
executed
by
the
petitioners,
in
the
bank's
records,
or
in
the
minutes
of
the
bank's
board
of
directors
or
loan
committee.
the
bank
was
later
closed
because
of
its
unsound
financial
condition.
the
fdic
was
appointed
as
receiver
and
the
fdic
acquired
the
note.
the
fdic
was
later
substituted
as
plaintiff
in
this
lawsuit.
fdic
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
the
petitioners'
misrepresentation
defense
constituted
an
agreement
that
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
12
u.s.c.
1823(e).
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
and
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed,
we
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari.
we
hold
today
that
a
condition
to
payment
of
the
note
including
the
truth
of
an
express
warranty
is
part
of
the
agreement
to
which
the
requirements
of
1823(e)
attach.
the
word
"agreement"
as
used
in
commercial
or
contract
law
often
has
a
wider
meaning
than
just
promise
and
embraces
such
a
condition
upon
performance.
that
common
meaning
must
be
assigned
to
agreement
in
1823(e)
in
order
for
that
section
to
achieve
its
purpose
of
allowing
federal
and
state
bank
examiners
to
rely
on
the
bank's
records
insuring
mature
consideration
of
unusual
loan
transactions
by
senior
bank
officials
and
preventing
fraudulent
insertion
of
new
terms
with
the
collusion
of
bank
employees
when
a
bank
appears
headed
for
failure.
we
reject
as
contrary
to
the
statute's
language
and
these
purposes,
petitioners
suggestions
that
the
presence
of
fraud
and
the
inducement
where
the
fdic's
knowledge
of
the
defense
prior
to
acquiring
the
note
renders
what
would
otherwise
be
an
agreement
not
an
agreement.
because
of
the
representations
alleged
by
the
petitioners
constituted
condition
on
repayment
and
did
not
meet
section
1823(d)'s
requirements,
summary
judgment
was
properly
granted.
we
therefore
affirm.
the
court's
opinion
is
unanimous.
