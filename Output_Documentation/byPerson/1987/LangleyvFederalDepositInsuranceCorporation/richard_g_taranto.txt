mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
federal
law
permits
petitioners
to
rely
on
unrecorded
oral
understanding
to
defeat
their
straightforward
written
obligation
to
repay
to
the
fdic
more
than
$450,000
in
borrowed
money.
that
question
has
two
parts
because
there
are
two
sources
of
federal
law,
section
1823(e)
and
federal
common
law.
our
primary
position
is
that
section
1823(e)
requires
petitioners
to
live
up
to
their
written
obligation.
our
secondary
position
is
that
federal
common
law
requires
the
same
result.
there
are
two
central
reasons
for
both
of
our
positions.
first,
it
is
necessary
to
the
successful
functioning
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
system.
thus
longstanding
federal
policy
and
the
basic
functioning
of
that
system
as
congress
intended
require
that
the
fdic
be
entitled
to
rely
on
the
bank's
written
documents.
second,
it
is
fair.
with
regard
to
who
should
bear
the
burden
of
the
$450,000
at
issue
here,
this
case
presents
a
choice
between
petitioners
on
the
one
hand
who
borrowed
the
money,
the
fdic
insurance
fund,
and
possibly
other
creditors
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
section
1823(e)
was
in
effect
to
give
by
law
the
status
of
a
holder
in
due
course
to
the
fdic,
and
that
status
would,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
preclude
the
assertion
of
personal
defenses,
including
fraud
in
the
inducement.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
fraud
in
the
factum,
as
i
understand
it,
occurs
when
one
person
fraudulently
induces
somebody
to
sign
a
different
document
from
the
document
that
person
thought
they
were
signing,
so
it
is
akin
to
forgery
or
duress
but
it
is
different
from
what
is
alleged
here,
which
i
think
is
expressly
in
the
complaint
termed
fraud
in
the
inducement,
that
representations
were
made
fraudulently
that
induced
them
to
then
sign
the
document
that
they
had
no
difficulty
reading
or
understanding.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
there
could
be
fraudulent...
there
could
be
fraud
in
the
execution
of
an
obligation
assumed
by
the
bank
when
it
granted
a
loan.
there
is
a
case
from
the
ninth
circuit
called
fdic
against
mio
in
which
a
bank
promised
when
being
given
a
note
to
use
the
proceeds
to
purchase
certain
voting
stock,
i
think,
in
the
bank
or
in
some
corporation,
and
instead
purchased
nonvoting
stock.
the
court
said
that
was
enforceable
against
the
fdic
because
the
maker
of
the
note
was
not
negligent
in
failing
to
discover
that
the
bank
had
fraudulently
failed
to
do
what
it
said
it
was
going
to
do.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
we
don't
see
how
an
actual
knowledge
requirement
can
be
read
into
the
statute.
the
statute
simply
says
that
no
agreement
that
tends
to
diminish
the
value
of
an
asset
obtained
by
the
fdic
shall
be
valid
against
the
fdic,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
distinction
according
to
whether
the
fdic
knew
on
the
eve
of
the
bank
closing,
perhaps
by
getting
a
telegram,
as
has
happened,
somebody
saying,
hey,
i
have
some
objection
to
this,
to
this
defense,
and
in
fact
no
court,
not
one,
to
my
knowledge,
has
suggested
an
actual
knowledge
requirement
in
the
context
of
section
1823(e).
when
some
courts
have
gone
on
past
1823(e)
and
discussed
the
scope
of
federal
common
law
protections,
several
of
them
have
discussed
an
actual
knowledge
requirement.
as
it
happens
in
gunter
itself
an
actual
knowledge
requirement
was
discussed,
but
there
it
was
satisfied.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
it
can
constitute
fraud
in
the
inducement,
but
it
would
not
be
a
permitted
defense
under
1823(e).
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
as
i
understand
petitioner's
distinction
and
the
distinction
the
gunter
court
alluded
to
and
then
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
hatmaker
case
more
explicitly
adopted,
that
distinction
would
say
that
certain
kinds
of
fraud
in
the
inducement
are
barred
by
1823(e)
but
certain
other
kinds
are
not,
depending
on
whether
the
fraudulent
representation
was
a
factual
representation
or
was
a
promise
to
do
something.
that
distinction,
too,
we
think,
is
simply
inconsistent
with
the
policies
behind
1823(e),
those
policies
being
designed
to
allow
the
fdic
to
look
at
the
bank
records
and
take
those
records
at
face
value
and
not
have
to
look
outside
the
bank
records.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
policies
as
we
understand
them
are
designed
to
allow
people
who
make...
who
assume
obligations,
make
a
note
in
this
case,
to
insist
that
any
term
that
they
think
is
relevant
to
the
note
be
placed
in
writing.
there
are
certain
cases
like
fraud
in
the
execution--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
we
do
think
that
the
statute
places
some
limitations
on
the
fdic's
protections.
the
fdic
can't
simply
say...
it
can't
win
in
all
cases
regardless
of
facts.
the
emphasis
in
the
statute
on
the
writing--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--we
think
the
critical
distinction
is
whether
the
borrower
had
an
opportunity
to
place
in
writing
conditions
he
relied
on
and
failed
to
exercise
that
opportunity.
that
is
a
distinction
that
we
think
comes
out
of
the
d'oench
case,
which
spoke
about
a
borrower
not
even--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--but
as
i
understand
your
fraud
in
the
execution
case,
the
borrower
didn't
have
any
opportunity
to
prevent
the
bank
from
doing
what
later
turns
out
to
be
fraud,
as
in
the
mio
case.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
we
think
that
any
basis
of
the
bargain,
any
representations,
whether
they
are
factual
or
promissory,
constitute
warranties
which
in
ordinary
commercial
law
are
agreements.
we
also
think
that
the
fraudulent
intent
behind
any
of
those
representations
cannot
be
relevant,
because
this
rule,
like
a
holder
in
due
course
rule,
is
intended
to
protect
third
parties,
and
where
third
parties
are
the
object
of
the
protection,
the
objective
words
exchanged
are
what
has
to
matter.
and
as
i
suggested,
that
is
a
view
that
we
think
is
supported
first
of
all
by
the
petitioner's
concession
at
every
level
in
this
case
that
if
the--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--if
i
understand
that
fraud
in
the
execution
example,
that
may
well
be
a
real
defense
in
holder
in
due
course
doctrine.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
am
not
sure--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
am
not
sure
that
in
that
case
the
asset
would
be
one
that
the
petitioner
can
fairly
be
said
to
have
obliged
himself
under,
so
that...
however
one
fits
the...
that
example
into
the
language
of
the
statute,
there
has
never
been
any
attempt
by
the
fdic
to
depart
radically
from
the
basic
distinction
in
the
holder
in
due
course
doctrine
between
the
personal
and
the
real
defense.
it
is
only
when
a
borrower
has
an
opportunity
to
protect
himself
and
fails
to
take
it
that
we
think
the
statute
applies,
that
there
is
an
agreement
that
cannot
be
valid
against
the
corporation.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that
would
certainly
be
one
way
of
accommodating
that
exception.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
as
i
understand,
that
is
the
essential
rationale
behind
most,
if
not
all
of
the
real
defenses,
forgery,
duress.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
there
is
no
evidence
specifically
in
the
legislative
history--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--or
in
the
statute
that
congress
surveyed
the
whole
range
of
questions
that
could
arise
when
the
fdic
seeks
to
enforce
a
note
that
it
obtains
from
the
bank,
and
i
might
add
at
this
point
that
that
is
the
primary
reason
why
we
think
any
argument
about
preemption
of
common
law,
if
we
were
to
get
to
that,
cannot
survive.
that
is,
whatever
congress
was
doing
in
passing
section
1823(e),
they
were
not
saying,
let's
think
about
all
possible
defenses
and
then
specify
these
defenses
and
only
these
defenses
are
to
be
forbidden.
they
simply
addressed
what
i
think
they
understood
to
be
one
problem,
a
problem
that
grew
out
of
the
d'oench
case
and
more
specifically,
as
we
show
in
our
brief,
out
of
a
third
circuit
case
that
prompted
the
introduction
of
the
legislation.
now,
it
is
true
that
our
position,
by
reading
section
1823(e)
to
grant
the
fdic
holder
in
due
course
status
as
a
matter
of
law
puts
the
fdic
in
a
much
more
favorable
position
than
the
bank
itself
would
be
in,
but
as
justice
jackson
said
in
the
d'oench
decision,
the
corporation,
the
fdic,
did
not
simply
step
into
the
shoes
of
local
banks.
the
purposes
sought
to
be
accomplished
by
it
can
be
accomplished
only
if
it
may
rely
on
the
integrity
of
banking
statements
and
banking
assets.
that
reliance
is
critical
at
at
least
two
different
places
in
the
overall
deposit
insurance
system.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
as
against
the
bank?
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
and
as
against
the
bank
officers
in
this
case
a
fraud
defense
not
only
could
be
asserted
but
has
been
asserted
and
remains
alive
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
what
justice
jackson
had
in
mind
when
referring
to
the
integrity
of
banking
statements
was
the
fdic
in
its
several
roles
as
examiner
of
the
institution
and
then
as
the
insurer
that
steps
in
once
a
bank
fails
must
be
able
to
take
those
bank
statements
in
effect
at
face
value
the
way
a
holder
in
due
course
would
take
a
note
purchased
in
good
faith
at
face
value.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
there
is
a
statutory
answer
and
then
a
policy
answer.
the
statutory
answer
is
that
an
actual
knowledge
requirement
simply,
we
think,
cannot
be
fitted
into
the
language
of
1823(e).
the
policy...
and
all
the
courts
have
agreed
to
that.
the
policy
answer
is
that
unlike
an
ordinary
holder
in
due
course
or
good
faith
purchaser,
the
fdic
is
not
in
a
position
to
simply
walk
away
from
the
transaction.
the
fdic
has
certain
obligations.
one
way
or
the
other
it
is
affected
by
the
value
of
this
asset.
either
it
has
to
pay
the
deposit
insurance
up
to
$100,000
for
each
depositor,
or
it
has
to
infuse
some
of
its
own
money
into
the
system
either
to
assist
the
bank
or
to
arrange
for
a
new
bank
to
take
over
the
failed
institution,
but
the
fdic
cannot
simply
upon
hearing
that
there
is
a
problem
with
the
asset
say,
i
won't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
the
fdic
is
in
effect
an
involuntary
creditor,
and
the
protections
should
accordingly
be
stronger
than
in
the
ordinary
holder
in
due
course.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
that
there
are
situations
in
which
the
o'dench
rule
would
cover...
that
it
would
cover
certain
situations
that
in
our
view
1823(e)
would
not.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
principally
it
applies
and
has
been
consistently
to
apply
to
the
fdic
acting
in
its
capacity
as
receiver.
there
are
in
fact
very
few
cases
that
apply
d'oench
where
in
our
view
1823(e)
would
not
apply.
there
may
be
some
situations,
for
example,
where
a
failed
bank
has
played
the
lead
role,
and
a
loan
participation
has
been
arranged.
in
many
situations
the
participating
bank
has
some
kind
of
informal
understanding
that
if
the
borrower
defaults,
then
the
loan
participation
comes
to
an
end
and
the
lead
bank
has
to
take
it
back.
what
the
fdic
is
presented
with
in
that
situation
is
simply
the
lead
bank's
participation
and
the
participant
bank
is
coming
in
and
saying
not
that
that
asset
should
be
diminished,
but
that
the
bank
has
to
take
on
a
new
obligation
that
doesn't
appear
in
the
books.
we
think
that
that,
too,
would
be
a
situation
that
would
be
covered
by
d'oench,
because
the
bank,
the
participant
bank
would
have
lent
themselves
to
a
transaction
that
was
likely
to
mislead
bank
examiners.
but
on
the
whole,
in
our
view
section
1823(e)
as
to
the
fdic
in
its
corporate
capacity
does
in
fact
cover
what
d'oench
covers.
now,
the
role
that
this
statute
plays
if
read
as
entitling
the
fdic
to
rely
on
bank
records
as
a
holder
in
due
course
would,
comes
into
play
first
of
all
in...
with
respect
to
the
fdic's
role
with
open
banks,
and
that
role
is
chiefly
to
ensure
that
those
banking
institutions
don't
in
the
end
threaten
the
solvency
of
the
fund.
congress
has
given
the
fdic
extensive
powers
to
examine
banks,
and
what
is
critical
is
that
in
those
examinations
the
fdic
examiners
be
able
to
rely
on
the
books
and
records
of
the
banks
as
they
appear
and
not
have
to
be
interviewing
people
outside
the
bank,
investigating
the
particular
law,
of
louisiana
in
this
case,
and
making
its
own
assessment
not
about
the
practical
collectibility
of
particular
assets,
but
about
their
legal
enforceability
if
on
their
face
they
appear
to
be
fully
valid.
the
second
place
in
the
system
that
this
ability
to
rely
on
bank
records
is
critical
is
when
a
bank
fails.
when
a
bank,
an
insured
institution,
fails,
the
fdic
has
several
options.
it
has
long
been
recognized
that
the
preferred
option
is
not
to
close
the
bank
and
pay
off
depositors,
but
to
try
to
keep
the
bank
open,
and
that
is
done
through
a
purchase
and
assumption
transaction,
whereby
another
bank,
usually
in
the
community,
takes
over
the
failed
institution.
that
is
preferable
for
a
number
of
reasons.
for
one,
all
depositors
are
fully
paid,
not
simply
up
to
the
$100,000.
it
keeps
the
bank
open
and
avoids
disruption
of
the
banking
services
in
the
community,
and
it
preserves
the
going
concern
value
of
the
bank.
an
assuming
bank
is
typically
willing
to
pay
some
substantial
amount
of
money
to
get
new
branches.
congress
itself
has
recognized
these
advantages.
even
recently,
this
summer,
since
the
briefing
in
this
case
was
completed,
congress
added
yet
a
new
method
by
which
the
fdic
can
keep
a
bank
open,
create
the
possibility
of
a
temporary
bridge
bank
in
title
5
of
the
competitive
equality
banking
act
of
1987.
what
is
critical
is
that
although
that
option
is
preferred
under
the
statute,
it
may
be
exercised
only
if
it
is
less
costly
than
the
principal
alternative,
simply
closing
the
bank
and
liquidating
it.
and
the
ability
to
rely
on
the
written
assets
of
the
bank
is
critical
in
three
respects
at
this
stage.
first
of
all,
of
course,
it
increases
the
value
of
those
assets
and
makes
the
preferred
option
more
likely
to
be
taken.
second
of
all,
the
determination
of
which
option
may
be
taken,
that
is,
the
assessment
of
which
option
is
more
or
less
costly,
must
be
made
very
quickly,
and
that
means
that
simply
as
a
matter
of
ensuring
the
accuracy
of
the
determination
the
fdic
should
be
able
to
rely
on
the
bank's
records.
and
finally,
when
the
bank
fails,
the
question
is
not
whether
a
loss
is
going
to
be
avoided
entirely.
the
question
is
who
will
bear
the
loss.
now,
it
is
possible
that
in
this
case
mr.
caughfield
or
the
other
bank
official
involved
can
successfully
be
sued,
and
petitioners
will
not
have
to
bear
this
loss,
but
as
between
petitioners
and
the
fdic,
it
seems
to
us
quite
clear
who
should
bear
that
loss,
because
petitioners
had
an
opportunity
to
protect
themselves
by
insisting
that
these
terms
be
placed
in
writing,
and
the
fdic,
of
course,
did
not.
the
fdic
came
in
after
the
transaction
was
completed.
here,
in
addition,
it
should
be
noted
that
unlike
in
the
d'oench
case,
all
we
are
talking
about
is
whether
petitioners
must
repay
money
that
wasn't
theirs
to
begin
with,
that
was
borrowed
from
the
bank.
in
the
d'oench
case
this
court
precluded
a
defense
by
the
maker
of
an
accommodation
note
and
required
that
person
to
pay
money
that
was
his
to
begin
with,
that
he
had
not
borrowed,
so
we
think
fairness
considerations
as
well
as
requirements
of
the
fdic
system
require
the
same
results.
let
me
say
a
word
finally
about
the
common
law
issue.
as
i
have
mentioned--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--we
think
d'oench
either
expressly
or
all
but
expressly
says
that
the
result
would
not
have
been
different
because
it
says
whether
bank
examiners
were
in
fact
deceived
or
not
is
simply
irrelevant
to
the
issue.
the
only
requirement
for
deciding
that
the
notemaker
as
opposed
to
the
fdic
fund
should
bear
the
loss
is
that
the
notemaker
lent
themselves
to
a
transaction
that
would
tend
to
deceive
bank
examiners.
if
those
are
enough,
then
an
actual
knowledge
requirement
is
simply
irrelevant.
briefly,
on
the
common
law
issue,
our
first
point,
as
we
suggested
in
our
brief,
is
that
1823(e)
cannot
be
read
as
a
preemption
of
common
law,
of
common
law
making
power
of
the
federal
courts
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i
think
some
of
this
court's
cases
have
spoken
about
it
as
preemption.
it
is
not
preemption
in
the
same
sense
as
federal
preemption
of
state
law,
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
general
jurisdictional
grant
by
congress
and
section
1819
4th
says
that
any
case
involving
the
fdic
arises
under
federal
law.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
legislative
history,
we
think,
or
in
the
statute
itself
that
what
congress
was
doing
here
was
like
what
it
was
doing
in
the
principal
cases
relied
on
by
petitioner.
congress
did
not,
as
i
have
suggested,
survey
the
entire
realm
of
possible
defenses
and
make
a
considered
judgment
that
these
and
only
these
defenses
were
to
be
precluded,
and
all
other
defenses
available
under
state
law
were
to
be
recognized.
and
we
think
that
once
the
issue
of
preemption
is
out
of
the
way
and
that
it
is
acknowledged
that
if
1823(e)
does
not
itself
cover
the
facts
here,
that
the
common
law
making
powers
of
this
court
should
lead
the
court
to
reach
the
same
result
that
the
fifth
circuit
reached
on
statutory
grounds.
under
the
kimbell
foods
analysis,
all
three
factors,
we
think,
lead
to
the
result,
first,
there
is
a
need
for
uniformity
in
the
federal
rule
because
there
is
a
single
nationwide
deposit
insurance
fund
that
is
threatened
every
time
there
is
a
half
a
million
dollar
loss
threatened.
second,
federal
policies,
as
i
have
tried
to
explain
them
and
as
they
are
reflected
in
1823(e),
would
be
frustrated
by
disabling
the
fdic
from
relying
on
bank
records.
and
finally,
we
don't
think
that
there
would
be
a
serious
interference
with
private
practices
based
on
state
law,
and
the
principal
reason
for
that
is
that
when
an
individual
deals
with
a
bank
the
norm
is
that
obligations,
promises
and
representations
be
placed
in
writing.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
certainly
does,
but
in
both
common
law
and
now
for
40
years
in
federal
law
with
respect
to
the
fdic
for
those
who
come
in
after
a
bank
fails
to
be
in
a
better
position,
whether
they
are
a
receiver
or
corporation.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
the
considerations
that
an
individual
would
ordinarily
be
expected
to
take
into
account
should
include
the
considerations
about
what
will
happen
if
the
bank
fails,
just
as
somebody
buying
a
security
of
some
type
from
a
corporation
should
take
into
account
priority
rules
that
may
occur
if
the
corporation
goes
into--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--the
principal
change,
we
think,
would
be
exactly
the
one
that
congress
intended
to
encourage
in
1823(e),
which
is
to
add
an
extra
measure
of
encouragement
for
people
when
dealing
with
banks
to
place
everything
that
they
understand
to
be
a
basis
of
the
bargain
in
writing.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
