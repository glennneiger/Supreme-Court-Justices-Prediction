justice
o'connor
what
do
you
want
us
to
look
at?
where
do
you
find
it?
justice
o'connor
and
you
say
that
some
substantially
lesser
acreage
was
in
fact
conveyed?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
promises
that
you
now
rely
upon
or
the
representations
that
you
now
rely
upon
were
apparently
made
by
the
actual
owner
of
the
property
who
sold
it
to
your
client?
justice
o'connor
the
owner
of
the
property
never
said
he
had
1600
acres,
or
whatever
it
was?
justice
o'connor
and
the
document
at
closing
included
this
document
that
you
called
our
attention
to?
justice
o'connor
for
that
number
of
acres?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
has
happened
to
your
lawsuit
against
the
bank
president
and
the
bank?
justice
o'connor
and
that
is
still
pending.
justice
o'connor
presumably
your
client
could
get
some
kind
of
adjustment
on
recovery
in
that
lawsuit.
justice
o'connor
mr.
shockey,
let
me
pursue
this
same
inquiry
from
a
slightly
different
direction.
are
the
representations
that
are
the
focus
of
your
petition
here
matters
that
would
be
defenses
not
available
to
a
holder
in
due
course
under
a
uniform
commercial
code
approach
in
ordinary
commercial
law?
justice
o'connor
would
they
be...
would
they
be
things
like
warranties
that
normally
would
not
be
available
against
a
holder
in
due
course?
justice
o'connor
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
statute
that
automatically
makes
the
fdic
a
holder
in
due
course
in
legal
effect,
don't
we?
justice
o'connor
mr.
shockey,
i
suppose
that
even
if
the
statute
didn't
cover
it,
that
we
would
fall
back
on
the
holding
of
the
d'oench
case.
do
you
think
the
statute
replaced
that
old
common
law
holding?
justice
o'connor
has
any
court
so
held?
justice
o'connor
no.
in
fact,
haven't
they
gone
ahead
and
applied
that
case
as
well?
justice
o'connor
fraud
in
the
factum,
so-called,
survives
holder
in
due
course
status.
justice
o'connor
how
do
you
distinguish
that
kind
of
fraud
from
fraud
in
the
inducement?
justice
o'connor
are
there
any
factual
misrepresentations
by
a
bank
officer
that
could
ever
give
the
borrower
a
real
defense
under
the
statute
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
would
it
make
any
difference
that
the
fdic
in
this
instance
did
have
actual
knowledge
before
it
took
over
the
assets?
justice
o'connor
mr.
taranto,
the
old
common
law
rule
under
the
d'oench
case,
would
that
yield
any
different
result
possibly?
justice
o'connor
what
type
of
situation
would--
