why
didn't
the
bank
agree
that
those...
that
much
land
would
be
delivered?
justice
white
they
did,
didn't
they?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
they
made
the
deal.
justice
white
why
wasn't
he
promising
that
that
customer
would
deliver
so
many
acres?
justice
white
why
wasn't
the
officer,
the
bank
officer
promising
that
the
bank's
customer
would
deliver
so
many
acres?
justice
white
why
wasn't
that
as
much
an
agreement
as
anything
else?
justice
white
there
still
is
a
question
of
what
does
an
agreement
mean.
justice
white
you
say
it
means
a
promise.
justice
white
would
you
have
won
if
this
had
occurred
in
the
eleventh
circuit?
justice
white
the
fdic
knew
the
facts
here?
justice
white
mr.
taranto,
don't
you
at
some
point
have
to
come
within
the
terms
of
the
statute?
what
is
your
argument
that
makes
these
agreements?
justice
white
wouldn't
the
fraud
in
the
execution
that
justice
stevens
mentioned
to
you
qualify
as
an
agreement
in
those
terms?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
holder
in
due
course.
it
says
an
agreement.
and
if
the
bank
says
here
is
what
you
are
going
to
sign,
and
then
substitutes
another
document,
there
has
been
an
agreement,
there
has
been
a
representation.
justice
white
it
sounds
to
me
like
it
is
as
much
an
agreement
as--
justice
white
but
the
inference
from
that
observation
would
be
that
if
the
fdic
knows
that
there
is
no
integrity
to
a
bank
statement,
why
should
they
win,
if
they
know
that
this
is
a
false
statement?
justice
white
--do
you
think
the
result
in
d'oench
would
have
been
different
if
the
fdic
had
known
that
the
note
was
really
not
a
note
at
all,
it
was
a
spurious
note?
