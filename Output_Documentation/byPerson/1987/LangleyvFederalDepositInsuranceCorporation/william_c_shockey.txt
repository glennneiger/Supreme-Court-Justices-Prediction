mr.
william
c.
shockey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
court
is
called
upon
in
this
case
first
to
resolve
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation,
what
meaning
do
we
give
to
1823(e).
the
fdic
naturally
urges
a
very
broad
reading
of
the
statute.
the
langleys,
whom
i
represent,
argue
a
very
restrictive
interpretation
of
that
statute.
in
looking
at
past
decisions
of
this
court
relative
to
statutory
interpretation
questions,
i
note
that
this
court
looks
first
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
then,
if
necessary,
at
the
legislative
history,
and
finally
at
policy
considerations,
and
i
will
take
each
of
those
in
turn.
the
language
of
the
statute
says
no
agreement
which
tends
to
diminish
or
defeat,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
shall
be
valid
as
against
the
corporation.
no
agreement.
that
is
the
key
word.
the
statute
does
not
say
no
claims.
the
statute
says
no
agreement.
we
concede
that
some
of
the
things
that
were
alleged
by
the
langleys
in
their
original
complaint
are
agreements
that
1832(e)
bars,
things
such
as
the
interest
rate
being,
supposed
to
have
been
different
from
what
was
in
the
note,
the
term
of
the
loan,
that
it
would
not
be
due
until
the
property
was
sold,
and
that
the
liability
on
the
note
was
in
rem.
we
concede
those
things.
those
are
agreements
at
variance
with
the
documents.
we
do
not
have
or
concede
that
representations
made
by
the
bank
president
as
alleged
relative
to
the
acreage
in
the
tract
of
land
in
question
or
as
to
the
mineral
acreage
and
the
status
of
the
mineral
rights
in
the
property.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
well,
first,
the
bank,
of
course--
mr.
william
c.
shockey
--wasn't
the
true
seller
of
the
property.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
if
your
honor
will
refer
to
the
mortgage
itself,
which
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
29,
you
will
see
the
fact
that
there
were
1,628.4
acres
in
the
mortgage
tract.
it
is
specified
in
the
mortgage.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
on
page
29
of
the
appendix
is...
that
is
one
of
the
pages
of
the
mortgage.
if
i
recall,
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page
there
is
a
reference
in
the
mortgage
itself
to
the
property
containing
1628.4
acres.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
yes,
ma'am,
i
do.
if
you
will
recall
from
the
allegations
in
our
complaint,
the
langleys
allege
that
the
property
in
fact
only
contained
1522
acres.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
we
counterclaimed.
if
you
will
recall,
the
suit
began
with
a
suit
on
the
note
by
the
bank.
we
filed
suit
in
federal
district
court
seeking
to
rescind
the
transaction
and
to
collect
treble
damages
under
the
rico
statute.
this
was
prior
to
the
time
the
bank
closed.
our
suit,
as
distinguished
from
all
the
other
fdic
litigation
that
i
have
reviewed,
and
i
have
tried
to
review
every
fdic
case,
our
case
was
pending.
our
case
was
pending
at
the
time
that
the
fdic
was
appointed
the
receiver
for
planters
bank.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
well,
what
the
case
boils
down
to
at
this
point
is
the,
and
i
will
explain
to
you
how
it
is
different--
mr.
william
c.
shockey
--promises
that
mr.
caughfield
as
the
president
of
the
bank
had
the
capacity
to
deliver,
if
you
will,
interest
rate,
term
of
loan,
and
things
of
those
nature,
okay,
but
mr.
caughfield
wasn't
delivering
the
property.
actually,
another
seller,
another...
a
seller,
a
customer
of
the
bank
actually
delivered
the
property,
actually
delivered...
the
mineral
interests.
mr.
caughfield
was
making
representations
about
the
quality
of
the
thing
that
was
to
be
the
object
of
the
sale,
not
necessarily
things
that
would
be
as
to
the
qualities
and
characteristics
of
the
loan
transaction
itself.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
excuse
me,
your
honor?
i
didn't
follow
your
question.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
we
in
fact
contend
that
he
was
promising
that
there
would
be.
he
represented
that
the
tract,
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
tract,
and
that
it
would
include
that
many
acres
of
property.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
well,
your
honor,
the
representations
as
to
how
many
acres
there
would
be
and
how
many
mineral
rights
he
would
get
were
an
ingredient,
if
you
will,
of
the
sale
between
leenerts
farms,
who
was
the
other
bank
customer,
and
my
clients.
representations
as
to
interest
rate,
term
of
loan,
and
that
sort
of
stuff
were
an
ingredient
of
the
loan
transaction.
you
actually
have
two
transactions
between
different
parties.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
no.
we
allege
they
were
made
by
the
bank
president.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
i
believe
it
is
alleged
in
our
complaint
that
the
langleys
met
the
seller
at
the
closing.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
the
documents
at
closing
included
a
sale
agreement,
a
deed,
possibly
you
may
refer
to
at
common
law,
which
is
included--
mr.
william
c.
shockey
--right,
and
a
separate
document,
a
mortgage,
which
is
the
lien
instrument
under
louisiana
law,
which
also
contains
the
reference
to
the
1628.4
acres.
both
instruments
contain
that
reference.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
well,
the
problem
is,
there
was
a
representation--
mr.
william
c.
shockey
--no,
there
was
less
acreage.
actually,
a
survey,
as
we
allege
in
the
complaint,
reveals
there
was
less
acreage.
in
fact,
over--
mr.
william
c.
shockey
--yes,
i
believe
the
exact
figure
is
1522,
as
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
well,
i
understand.
the
mortgage
itself
is
not
in
the
form
sanctioned
by
the
statute,
as
in
approved
by
the
board
of
directors,
and
this
and
that
and
the
other.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
well,
it
surely
makes
it
clear
that
that
is
what
the
langleys
thought
they
were
buying.
i
agree
with
you
there.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
well,
would
love
to
rely
on
my
mortgage,
and
if
the
court
would
rely
on
my
mortgage
i
would
be
very
enthralled,
but
the
point
is,
i
don't
think
the
mortgage
itself
fits
the
requirements
under
1823(e).
you
have
got
to
have
it
not
only
in
writing,
but
you
have
also
got
to
have
it
approved
by
the
board,
and
this
and
that
and
the
other.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
yes,
and--
mr.
william
c.
shockey
--the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes
and
no,
and
i
will
explain.
you
get
to
a
question
of
state
law
there.
you
get
to
a
question
of
who
the
lawyer
who
prepared
the
mortgage
instrument
is
actually
representing.
now,
we
allege
in
our
complaint
that
the
lawyer
who
prepared
the
mortgage
instrument
was
the
bank's
lawyer.
he
was
the
lawyer
for
the
bank.
so
you
get
to
a
state
law
question
at
that
point
in
terms
of
who
is
representing
to
who.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
the
representation
contained
in
the
mortgage,
you
know,
that
is
a
document
prepared
from,
if
you
will,
prepared
from
the
same,
the
sale
document.
they
have
the
same
appendix
with
the
property
description.
so
i
am
not
sure
we
can
characterize
that
as
an
agreement.
it
is
a
document,
you
know,
of
course,
prepared
by
the
attorney
who
was
representing
the
bank.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
that
is
what
i
believe.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
right,
and
of
course,
where
did
my
client
get
the
information?
he
got
it
from
the
bank.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
the
bank
president,
for
your
information,
went
into
bankruptcy.
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
his
discharge
has
been
stayed
pending
the
final
outcome
of
the
case.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
that
is
still
pending.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
assuming
the
gentleman
is
solvent.
of
course,
as
i
indicated,
he
has
gone
into
bankruptcy.
his
discharge
has
been
stayed
pending
the
final
resolution
of
this
case,
be
it
in
this
court
or
filed
under
remand.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
that
would
be
an
agreement.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
i
believe
that
is
the
conclusion
that
we
are
left
with.
yes,
i
think
that
is.
you
are
comfortable
with
that?
obviously,
i
am
not
comfortable
with
the
superholder
in
due
course
statute.
the
statute
is
mean.
it
is
tough.
it
is
not
fair.
it
is
really
not
fair
to
the
langleys
because
their
suit
was
pending
seven
months
prior
to
the
time
the
bank
was
closed.
basically
what
this
court
has
got
to
determine
is
what
is
and
what
isn't
beyond
the
scope
of
1823.
we
have
briefed
to
death
the
question
of
what
is
a
representation
and
what
is
a
warranty
and
all
that.
i
mean,
we
couldn't
cite
another
source
other
than
possibly
my
mother
for
something
like
that.
i
think
what
you've
got
to
do
is
picture
in
your
mind
w.
t.
langley
and
roy
caughfield
standing
in
the
lobby
of
the
planters
bank
in
opelousas,
louisiana,
and
think
how
this
transaction
went
down,
how...
what
must
one
have
said
to
the
other
and
in
what
context,
gleaned
from
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
i
simply
don't
have
time
to
go
through
it,
but
if
you
will
think
of
that
in
your
mind,
i
think
you
will
come
to
have
a
better
appreciation
of
what
was
agreed
upon
between
the
gentlemen
and
what
was
in
fact
just
represented
and
taken
for
granted
by
the
other.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
our
defenses--
mr.
william
c.
shockey
--they
would
not
be
available
against
a
holder
in
due
course
who
was
otherwise
a
legitimate
holder
in
due
course
to
accrue
value,
no
default,
et
cetera.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
except
for
two
things,
and
let
me
respond
to
your
question
in
two
parts.
the
statute,
mind
you,
the
fdic
in
a
general
sense
is
going
to
take
these
problem
loans
where
they
are
defaulted,
so
holder
in
due
course
laws
wouldn't
apply
anyway,
where
they
are
in
default.
i
am
saying
the
fdic...
if
you
get
these
problem
loans,
they
are
in
default
and
of
course
if
a
loan
is
past
due,
a
note
past
due,
you
can't
be
holder
in
due
course.
the
representations
that
we
are
keying
upon
are
really
the
representations
that
induced
mr.
langley
to
buy
the
property,
not
necessarily
the
representations
that
induced
him
to
make
the
loan.
you
have
got
to
remember,
the
sale
was
between
leenerts
farms
and
mr.
langley.
the
loan
transaction
was
between
mr.
langley
and
the
bank.
i
refer
this
court
to
its
recent
decision
in
sedima
regarding
strict
construction
of
language.
basically
this
court--
mr.
william
c.
shockey
--i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
no,
sir,
it
is
not
in
the
appendix.
it
is
in
the
record,
of
course.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
i
do
believe
so,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
frankly,
i
cannot
recall
the
provisions
of
the
instrument
in
that
specificity.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
i
would
like
to
refer
you,
as
i
indicated,
to
the
sedima
case.
that
is
about
the
last
pronouncement
of
this
court
that
i
am
familiar
with
regarding
statutory
construction.
i
also
refer
this
court
to
the
dissent
in
the
philadelphia
gear
case,
philadelphia
gear
versus
fdic.
justice
marshall
wrote
at
that
time,
"nevertheless,
to
reach
this
common
sense
result,
the
court
must
read
qualifications
into
the
statute
that
do
not
appear
there.
"
"we
recently
recognized
that
even
when
the
ingenuity
of
businessmen
creates
transactions
and
corporate
forms
not
contemplated
by
congress,
the
courts
must
enforce
the
statutes
congress
has
written.
"
look
at
the
words
of
the
statute.
now,
legislative
history.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
what
is
an
agreement?
that
is
the
question.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
but
it
does
not
mean
representations
as
to
the
quality
of
the
thing
that
is
the
subject
of
another
transaction
between
the
borrower
and
another
party.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
i
don't
follow
your
point.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
but
the
difference
between
your
analogy
and
our
case
is,
you
are
talking
about
you
selling
to
me,
two
parties
to
the
transaction,
and
the
party
making
the
representation
is
the
seller.
in
our
case,
the
party
making
the
representation
is
not
the
seller.
the
seller
is
somebody
else.
roy
caughfield
had
no
obligation,
implied
or
otherwise,
to
make
representations
about
the
qualities
of
the
thing.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
certainly.
we
look
at
legislative
history
only
if
the
language
of
the
statute
is
unclear,
as
this
court
mentioned
in
the
blum
versus
stenson
case.
the
legislative
history
is
sparse.
most
of
the
legislative
history
that
is
available
to
the
court
is
actually
testimony
given
by
members
of
the
fdic
and
their
counsel
at
committee
hearings.
the
langleys
had
no
lobby
in
washington
in
1950.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
well,
i
think
it
means
what
one
would
ordinarily
think
"agreement"
means.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
because
i
am
sure
the
legislative
history
is
going
to
be
relied
upon
by
my
opponent.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
most
of
the
legislative
history
is
sparse
on
this
act,
more
so
than
on
any
that
i
can
recall
before.
maybe
it
is
the
time.
this
court
has
indicated
and
most
of
it
has
indicated
fdic
personnel--
mr.
william
c.
shockey
--that
is
what
i
am
saying,
because
under,
you
know,
at
least
under
louisiana
law,
and
we
have
the
civil
code,
but
the
idea
of
fraud
is
not
that
much
different
from
what
i
learned
in
law
school
about
the
common
law.
under
our
law,
if
there
is
fraud
and
it
induces
you
into
the
transaction,
then
it
is
as
if
you
didn't
give
your
consent.
it
erases,
vitiates,
to
use
that
word,
the
consent,
and
without
consent
there
is
no
agreement,
because
an
agreement
is
an
accord
of
two
minds
and
two
wills.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
i
think
so.
i
think
gunter
i
would
have
won.
i
had
the
missing
factual
links
that
were
not
apparent
in
gunter
because
if
you
will
recall,
in
gunter
the
borrowers
conceded
that
the
fdic
had
no
knowledge,
and
also,
of
course--
mr.
william
c.
shockey
--yes,
sir.
as
the
appendix
will
reflect,
the
suit
was
filed
well
before
the
bank
was
closed,
and
the
pendency
of
the
suit
was
noted
in
two
examination
reports
by
the
fdic
and
rendered
prior
to
the
time
the
bank
closed.
that
is
a
fact
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
every
other
fdic
case
that
i
know
about.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
well,
that's
true.
such
as,
for
example,
i
am
going
to
give
you
an
interest
rate
less
than
what
is
specified
in
the
note.
i
am
going
to
tie
it
to
chase
and--
mr.
william
c.
shockey
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
well,
all
of
the
federal
circuit
courts
have
uniformly
recognized
that
that
sort
of
representation,
if
you
will,
the
gunter
court
went
to
the
point
of
trying
to
distinguish
between
promissory
fraud
and
fraud
that
did
not
involve
a
promise
to
deliver
at
some
future
point
in
time.
i
believe
the
issue
in
gunter
was
to...
one
of
the
issues
in
gunter,
as
an
example,
was
to
make
certain
loans
in
the
future
or
it
was
in
one
of
the
other
case.
so
the
federal
circuit
courts
have
uniformly
held
against
me
on
that
point,
all
of
them,
so
when
i
came
to
the
fifth
circuit
i
was
in
a
position
of
having
to
concede
that
point,
and
i
came
to
this
court
on
the
difference
between
the
gunter
case
and
my
case.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
i
would
love
for
this
court
to
so
hold.
and
basically,
you
know,
i
can
live
with
gunter.
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
gunter
and
apply
it
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
can
live
with
that.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
that's
correct.

the
legislative
history
is
really
not
of
much
help.
the
weight
to
be
afforded
remarks
made
in
the
legislative
debate
by
others
other
than
the
drafter
or
sponsor
this
court
has
indicated
is
entitled
very
little
weight.
further,
that
even
the
contemporaneous
remarks
of
one
legislator
speaking
about
the
purposes
or
intendments
of
enactment,
this
court
has
previously
recognized
as
not--
mr.
william
c.
shockey
--i
think
the
statute
replaces
that
common
law
holding
in
terms
of--
mr.
william
c.
shockey
--no,
ma'am.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
there
have
been
some
federal
circuit
courts
that
have
applied
that.
either
i
am
missing
the
boat
or
my
client
ought
to
pay
me
double
for
my
brilliance,
but
i
haven't
seen
the
first
time
that
anybody
has
brought
up
in
those
cases
the
preemption
question.
nobody
has
to
my
knowledge
in
those
reported
decisions
urged
that
1823(e)
supplants
the
dench
case.
i
haven't
seen
it.
and
hopefully
i
shouldn't
be
penalized
for
that.
i
believe
federal
common
law
still
has
application
here.
it
has
application
for
purposes
of
interpreting
1823(e),
just
as
you
bad
noted
in
the
philadelphia
gear
case
that
you
look
to
federal
law
to
determine
what
is
a
"deposit"
for
purposes
of
another
statute
under
the
federal
deposit
insurance
act
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
corporation
would
be
required
to
make
good
on
a
deposit.
we
can
accept
that
federal
common
law
applies.
we
do
not
concede
that
federal
common
law
would
apply
in
this
case
in
terms
of
other
defenses.
basically
the
u.s.
v.
kimbell
foods
case
announced
a
three-prong
test
for
determining
whether
or
not
federal
common
law
or
state
law
should
apply.
i
think
if
you
will
look
at
that
case
in
light
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
you
will
find
that
a
state
law
rule
or
decision
in
terms
of
the
fraud
issue
can
be
formulated
that
would
not
do
violence
to
the
federal
policies
and
what
have
you.
mr.
william
c.
shockey
when
this
bill
that
became
this
act
moved
through
the
legislative
process,
it
was
amended
on
the
house
floor,
as
i
recall,
to
change
the
word
which
was
"simultaneously"
in
the
original
draft,
talking
about
when
this
agreement
must
be
placed
in
writing
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff,
to
the
word
"contemporaneously".
representative
walter
handled
the
bill
on
the
legislative
floor,
and
he
had
some
remarks
which
are
important
not
only
for
purposes
of
1823(e)
and
what
does
the
statute
mean,
but
also
for
federal
common
law.
he
said,
in
part,
and
this
is
from
96
congressional
record
10731
and
32,
he
said
in
part,
"prior
to
and
up
to
the
time
of
an
unfortunate
interpretation
of
the
law
it
was
believed
that
all
legal
agreements
entered
into
by
the
bank
and
obligor
were
binding
on
the
corporation,
fdic.
"
he
goes
on,
at
page
732:
"it
was
never
the
intention
of
congress
to
give
the
corporation
a
stronger
position
than
that
of
the
bank,
and
the
adoption
of
the
amendment,
my
amendment,
is
offered
to
prove
heretofore
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
that
any
agreement
in
the
absence
of
fraud
is
binding
on
the
corporation.
"
this
is
a
fraud
case.
thank
you.
