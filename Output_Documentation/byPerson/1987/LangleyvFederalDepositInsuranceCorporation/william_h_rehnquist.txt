chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-489,
w.
t.
langley
versus
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
mr.
shockey,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
your
complaint,
did
you
seek
to
set
aside
the
transaction
or
to
simply
counterclaim
for
the
decreased
value
of
the
property?
chief
justice
rehnquist
ordinarily
a
representation
of
a
warranty
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
in
a
mortgage
like
that
runs
from
the
mortgagor
to
the
mortgagee.
it
would
run,
someone
said
earlier,
from
your
client
to
the
bank,
and
not
vice
versa.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
trying
now
to
show
us
that
the
word
"agreement"
in
the
statute
doesn't
mean
what
one
would
ordinarily
think
"agreement"
would
mean?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
why
do
you
have
to
go
to
the
legislative
history?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
0
[generallaughter.]
your
opponent
will
say
the
same
thing,
no
doubt,
so
we
have
to
get
into
the
legislative
history.
you
are
right.
chief
justice
rehnquist
isn't
what
you
are
trying
to
say,
or
perhaps
you
have
already
succeeded
in
saying
it,
is
that
there
is
a
difference
between
an
agreement
as
contained
in
the
statute
and
a
representation
that
is
fraudulent
that
would
be
a
basis
for
setting
aside
the
transaction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shockey.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
taranto.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
taranto,
you
say
it's
fair,
but
do
you
really
think
congress
meant
to
totally
repeal
the
doctrine
of
fraud
and
the
inducement
as
applied
to
this
kind
of
transaction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
talk
about
the
integrity
of
banking
statements
and
so
forth,
ordinarily
that
would
not
be
thought
to
suggest
that
a
statement
of
a
bank
showing
a
note
payable
for
$300,000
was
free
of
any
defenses
like
fraud
in
the
inducement.
you
wouldn't
say
that
statement
lacked
integrity
if
they
showed
on
their
statement
a
note
for
$300,000.
there
may
be
defenses
to
a
note
like
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
i
don't
see
where
you
get
into
the
sense
of
integrity
of
the
bank
statements.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
ordinarily
speak
of
that
sort
of
thing
as
preemption?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
bank
is
subject
to
the
same
fraud
laws
in
most
states
as
any
other.
if
they
lie
or
deceive
a
transaction
can
be
set
aside.
this
certainly
changes
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
since
you
never
know
whether
a
bank
is
going
to
fail,
it
just
alters
a
very
substantial
part
of
ordinary
common
law
governing
fraud,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
may
be
a
desirable
result
but
i
don't
think
it
is
accurate
to
say
that
nothing
would
be
changed
if
we
did
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
mr.
shockey,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shockey.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-489,
langley
versus
federal
deposit
insurance
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
