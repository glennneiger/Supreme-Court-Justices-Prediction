mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
last
instruction...
the
very
last
instruction,
the
jury
in
this
case
heard
before
it
retired
to
deliberate...
and
this
is
on
page
95
of
the
joint
appendix,
is
as
follows:
the
court
said
as
it
passed
out
the
forms
to
the
jury,
"let
me
remind
you
that,
as
you
consider
each
of
the
circumstances,
you
must
indicate
"yes"
or
"no",
however
your
unanimous
decision
falls.
"
"you
must
indicate
"yes"
or
"no"
as
to
each
of
those
circumstances.
"
it
seems
to
me
that
that
instruction,
together
with
the
form
that
was
used
in
this
case,
plus
the
instructions
that
where
the
court
before
the
closing
arguments
of
counsel,
went
through
the
form,
and
six
or
seven
times
reminded
the
jury
that
their
determination
on
each
question
must
be
unanimous.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
at
page
95,
justice
scalia.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
closing
arguments
are
concluded;
the
court
has
already
reviewed
with
the
jury
before
closing
arguments
the
form
itself,
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief,
and
now
he
is
sending
the
jury
out
to
deliberate
and
he
says,
"let
me
remind
you
as
you
consider
each
of
the
circumstances,
you
must
indicate
"yes"
or
"no"
however
your
unanimous
decision
falls.
"
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
the
point,
justice
white,
is
that
these
instructions
read
by
a
reasonable
juror
would
have
led
them
to
conclude
that
they
must
unanimously
decide
"yes"
or
"no"
on
each
one
of
the
mitigating
circumstances,
and
if
that
is
so,
then
we
don't
have
a
lockett...
eddings
problem
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
the
jury
deliberated,
considered
the
evidence
considered
in
mitigation,
and
rejected
it.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
i
don't
think
that,
with
all
due
respect
to
mr.
burns,
that
his
interpretation
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
correct.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
reached
precisely
that
point.
their
view
was
that
the
statute
requires
unanimity
as
to
"yes"
or
"no"
with
respect
to
the
mitigating
circumstances,
that
they
consider
that
the
jury
in
this
case
consider
the
evidence--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--that's
not
correct.
if
eleven
jurors
thought
there
were
mitigating
circumstances
and
one
thought
there
was
not,
the
jury
would
have
to
continue
to
deliberate
until
they
reached
a
conclusion.
and
if
they
could
reach
a
conclusion,
then
there
would
be
a
hung
jury.
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
where
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
at
126...
127,
the
court
of
appeals
makes
that
exact
argument.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
there
couldn't
have
been
a
hold-out
juror;
the
jury
would
have
hung
and
under
the
maryland
statute,
life
imprisonment
would
have
been
tendered.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
no.
under
the
maryland
statute,
life
imprisonment
would
have
imposed.
the
instructions
in
this
case,
and
i
think
this
is
a
jury
instruction
case
under
california
v.
brown,
one
is
obligated
to
look
at
all
the
instructions
including
the
language
of
the
form
and
the
instructions
that
the
court
gave
as
it
explained
the
form
in
its
final
instructions,
as
i
pointed
out,
and
determined
what
a
reasonable
juror
under
the
circumstance
would
have...
how
he
or
she
would
have
viewed
this
instruction.
and
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
they
would
have
concluded
that
there
was
a
requirement
of
unanimity
and
that
they
had
to
make
an
ultimate
determination.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
right.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
and
life
imprisonment.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
justice
kennedy,
the
instructions
of
this
court
were
"answer
every
question".
so
i
would
expect
in
every
form
in
the
other
cases
when
this
was
used,
that
they
would
have
answered
every
question.
when
they
changed
the
form,
when
the
new
form
came
into
place,
and
the
jury
was
given
the
opportunity
to
say,
"well,
we've
taken
an
initial
straw
vote
and
some
of
us
think
there's
mitigation
evidence
here,
but
we
all
can't
agree.
"
they
didn't
have
to
force
themselves
to
deliberate
and
debate
the
issue
further;
they
were
just
given
the
opportunity
on
the
new
form
to
indicate
that
and
go
on
to
weighing.
and
so
i
don't
think
they
were
compelled
as
a
jury
through
the
deliberative
process
to
reach
a
conclusion.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
they
could
not
reach
a
conclusion,
and
therefore
decided
to
leave
it
blank
on
the
old
form,
they
would
have
had
a
hung
jury.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that
is
correct,
and
indeed
there
is
at
least
one
case--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--that's
exactly
the
problem
that
the
court
of
appeals
thinks
that
they
were
addressing
when
they
set
forth
in
their
opinion
explaining
why
the
new
form
came
into
being.
they
posit
what
they
describe
as
the
"anomalous
circumstance"
where
the
jury
might
hang
on
mitigating
circumstances;
but
if
they
had
gotten
to
weighing,
would
have
concluded
that
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
anyway.
so
under
the
maryland
scheme,
life
imprisonment
would
have
been
imposed.
and
in
order
to
avoid
that
circumstance,
they
announced
therefor
the
new
form
which
allows
the
jury
to
say
"we
can't
all
agree
on
mitigating
circumstances.
"
"bit
we'll
go
to
weighing
anyhow,
and
reach
an
ultimate
conclusion.
"
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
so-stated.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
in
this
opinion.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
the
statute
talks
about
unanimity
and
the
final
version
and
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
had
adopted
the
form,
although
there
is
one
minor
change
between
the
form
that
was
used
in
this
case
and
the
rule.
but
that
formed
part
of
the
statute,
too.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
what
they
did
was
under
the
old
arrangement,
before
the
new
form
came
into
place,
the
court
of
appeals,
relying
upon
the
statute,
and
relying
upon
their
rulemaking
authority,
adopted
a
form
which
mandated
unanimity
for
a
no
answer
on
the
form.
the
statute
itself
talks
in
terms
of
unanimity
for
"yes".
it
does
not
talk
in
terms
of
unanimity
for
"no",
and
also
has
a
unanimity
for
an
ultimate
determination.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
but
maryland
law
was
by
virtue
of
the
rule
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
a
part
of
maryland
law,
that
unanimity
was
required.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
no,
a
rule
that
was
pre-existing
this
case,
because
the
form
itself
was
adopted
by
rule
in
maryland,
and
was
in
place
for
all
the
cases
that
was
decided
before
this.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
no.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
correct.
but
that
was
clarified
by
the
judge's
question.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
when
they
adopted
a
new
form,
they
allowed
the
jury
not
to
get
hung
up
on--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--that's
correct,
they
did.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
justice
marshall,
i
can't
agree
with
you.
i
think
that
if
you
read
the
instructions
in
this
case
as
i
think
you
are
compelled
to
do
in
their
totality,
under
california
v.
brown,--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--well,
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
those
instructions
fairly
and
reasonably
would
lead
a
reasonable
juror
under
these
circumstances
to
conclude
they
had
to
reach
unanimous
agreement.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
so.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
justice
scalia,
i
don't
mean
to
quarrel
with
your
hypothetical,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
it
operates.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
for
the
first
reason
is,
as
the
judge
in
this
case
instructed,
he
instructed
the
jury
"you
must
indicate
"yes"
or
"no"
as
to
each
of
those
circumstances.
"
they
weren't
given
the
option
of
a
non-answer,
and
that's
why
they
answered
every
one
of
these
questions;
why
the
dissent
points
out
in
every
one
of
the
capital
cases
that
you
look
at--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--well,
just
as
a
judge
instructs
them
to
be
unanimous
in
the
guilt
or
innocence
phase:
reach
a
determination;
do
you
agree
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
or
not?
and
if
the
straw
poll
at
guilt
or
innocence
is
seven
to
five,
the
answer
is
is
not
he's
not
guilty;
the
answer
is
you
continue
to
deliberate.
what
the
maryland--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--that
is
exactly
right,
and
indeed
there
is
one
circumstance
in
the--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
it
would
be
life
imprisonment?
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--it
would
be
life
imprisonment
under
the
maryland
procedure,
because
they
could
not
reach
an
unanimous
verdict.
and
that's
exactly
why
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
posits
in
their
hypothetical
that
if
they
hang
on
mitigation,
had
they
gotten
to
weighing,
they
would
have
decided
on
the
death
penalty,
that
then
there
is
a
need
for
the
change
in
the
form.
i
would
like
to
make
just
a
few
more
points
on
this
issue
before
we
turn--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--he
did
not,
if
you're
question
is,
did
he
instruct
them
what
would
happen
if
they
were
hung,
he
did
not
so-instruct
them.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
no,
that
is
correct.
i
mean,
he
did
just
the
opposite.
he
said,
consider
each
of
the
circumstances:
you
must
indicate
either
yes
or
no,
however
your
unanimous
decision
falls.
those
were
his
exact
words:
"you
must
indicate
"yes"
or
"no"
as
to
each
of
those
circumstances.
"
that's
the
last
instruction
the
jury
got
from
the
court
before
they
retired
to
deliberate.
that
instruction
is
very
clear.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
exactly
right.
the
jury
reached
the
unanimous
verdict.
and
there's
no
objective
evidence
here
that
would
suggest
that
there
was
any
disagreement.
chief
justice
rehnquist
asked
the
question
of
mr.
burns,
you
know,
is
there
anything
to
suggest
that
this
is
anything
more
than
a
hypothetical?
the
answer
is
clearly
no.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
justice
rehnquist,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
would
have...
the
two
possibilities...
if
they
could
not
agree,
they
would
have
come
back
to
the
court
and
said
they
can't
agree,
we
know
at
least
in
one
circumstance,
that
one
of
the
lodgings
that
was
submitted
to
the
court
by
the
petitioner,
that
a
jury
in
fact
did
hang,
and
it
appears
that
they
hung
up
on
mitigating
circumstances,
and
if
they
deliberated
for
12
hours
and
a
life
imprisonment
was
imposed.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
they
are
not
instructed
in
maryland
that
what
the
possibility
of
hanging
might
be.
they
are
asked
to
make
a
determination.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
and
indeed
you
don't
want
to
encourage
a
jury
to
not
be
able
to
reach
a
conclusion
to
hang.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
not
including
that
notion,
or
instructing
the
jury.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
the
mitigating
circumstances
under
the
state
statute
are...
i
mean,
there
are
seven
statutorily
defined
mitigating
circumstances,
and
then
another
category--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--a
catch-all
for
anything
else.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
and
really
the
first
seven
are
really
factual
determinations
that
the
court,
the
rule,
is
requiring
the
jury
to
make:
tell
us
where
you
find
that
there
is
credible
evidence
to
support
whatever
the
mitigating
circumstance
is?
and
that's
a
question
capable
of
a
yes
or
no
answer.
we
have
listened
to
the
evidence;
we
have
weighed
it,
and
we
don't
find
it
credible.
we
mark
no.
we
listen
to
the
evidence
and
we
do
find
it
credible
yes
that
mitigating
circumstance
exists
and
we
go
to
the
next
one.
that's
the
process
of
the
jury
system.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
i
think
you
are
part
wrong,
justice
stevens.
let
me
try
and
explain.
the
trial
judge,
in
his
trial
judge's
report,
which
is
required
under
the
maryland
statute,
said
"i
don't
disagree
with
the
conclusions
reached
by
the
jury,
although
there
was
evidence
of
a
mitigating
circumstance:
youth.
"
"he
was
20
years
old.
"
now,
the
argument
of
counsel
at
the
sentencing
phase
was,
the
prosecutor
says,
20>
["].
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
they
are
not
one
of
the
enumerated
ones,
and
then--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--under
number
8,
the
jury
makes
a
two-part
determination,
it
seems
to
me.
one
part
is,
do
we
find
credible
evidence
that
this
fact
exists
or
not?
the
second
part
is,
does
that
fact
mitigate?
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
because
one
through
seven
are
defined
to
be
mitigating.
number
8
is
a
two-part
question.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
that's
correct.
that,
i
believe
is
the
conclusion--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--right.
and
their
answer
to
number
8
was
none.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
i
mean,
they
affirmatively
went
to
the
point
to
where...
this
jury,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--well,
justice
white--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--that's
right,
and
in
order
to
find
that
there
is
no
mitigating
circumstance,
you
must
be
unanimous.
and
if
you
are
in
neither
position,
you
must
continue
to
deliberate.
and
if
you
can't
reach--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--well,
he
did,
i
believe.
in
the
last
instruction,
i
believe
he
precisely
does
that.
it
says,
"however
your
unanimous
decision
falls,
answer
yes
or
no.
"
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
justice
scalia,
let
me--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--well,
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
instructions
together,
i
believe
that
under
california
v.
brown,
a
reasonable
juror
would
have
understood
the
instructions
to
be
read
as
the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
them
in
this
case.
but
there
is
a
couple
of
other
things
that
i
would
point
to
that
would
lead
you
to
that
same
conclusion.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
no.
there
has
been
a
circumstance
where
the
jury
answered
the
aggravating
questions;
found
an
aggravating
circumstance;
got
to
the
mitigating
circumstance;
answered
one
of
those
yes;
didn't
fill
out
anything
else;
and
was
hung;
deliberated
for
12
hours
and
couldn't
reach
a
verdict.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
i
submit
we
don't
know.
the
form
has
some
marks
next
to
the
mitigating--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--well,
if
the
jury
was
unable
to
reach
a
determination
on
each
of
the
questions,
then
they
would
be
hung
and
a
life
sentence
under
the
form--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--that
is
the
anomalous
circumstance
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
concerned
about
and
therefore
announced
a
new
form
to
be
used
in
future
cases.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
well,
the
aggravating
comes
first
in
the
form,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy,
that
passage
that
you
are
referring
to
in
141
is
referring
to
the
new
procedure,
not
the
form
that
was
in
place
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
decided.
remember
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
announced
that
they
didn't
want
the
form
to
be
limited
as
it
was
in
this
case,
which
would
create
the
circumstance
if
the
jury
couldn't
reach
a
determination
on
mitigating,
but
had
gone
on
to
weigh,
and
had
reached
the
death
penalty,
under
those
circumstances
they
would
have
been
a
hung
jury,
life
imprisonment
would
have
been
imposed
under
the
maryland
statute.
they
wanted
to
avoid
that
anomalous
circumstance,
so
they
announced
this
new
form.
let
me
just
point
out
a
couple
more
points
with
respect
to
this
issue:
why
i
think
a
reasonable
juror
would
have
read
the
instructions
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
to
be.
the
defendant
in
this
case
did
not
object
to
these
instructions.
there
is
nothing
in
the
closing
arguments
from
defense
counsel,
or
from
the
prosecutor,
which
suggested
that
anybody
understood
the
form
in
any
way
other
than
it
was
a
unanimous
decision
was
required
by
the
jury
on
each
one
of
the
questions
presented.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rely
on
that.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
they
did
not.
if
you
agree
with
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
that
a
reasonable
juror
would
have
understood
these
instructions
to
require
a
unanimous
decision
whether
the
answer
was
yes
or
no
to
the
mitigating
circumstances,
then
there
really
is
not
a
problem
in
lockett
or
eddings.
the
defendant
was
given
the
opportunity
to
present
his
evidence
on
mitigation
for
the
jury
to
consider,
and
the
jury
in
this
case
did
consider
it
and
rejected
it.
and
therefore
there
was
nothing
to
weigh,
and
the
statute
is
not
in
permissively
mandatory.
the
maryland
statute
was
designed
to
impose
a
system
of
guided
discretion,
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
conduct
a
proportionality
review,
and
so
that
in
each
case,
whether
the
defendant
be
sentenced
by
a
judge
or
a
jury,
the
same
process
would
obtain.
the
court
would
know
what
aggravating
factor
the
sentencer
relied
upon
for
the
determination;
what
mitigating
factor
the
sentencer
had
found,
and
what
the
ultimate
decision
was.
and
the
word
"sentencer"
i
think
is
key,
because
the
determination
here,
the
sentencer
is
the
jury,
in
the
context
where
the
jury
is
selected
by
the
defendant.
it's
not
individual
members
of
the
jury;
it
is
the
jury
as
a
whole,
and
juries
under
maryland
law
decide
things
unanimously.
i'd
like
to
turn
if
i
could
now
briefly
to
our
argument
with
respect
to
the
victim
impact
evidence
in
booth.
this
case
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
ten
days
after
the
decision
in
booth.
the
issue
was
not
briefed
or
argued
before
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
construes
the
evidence
that
came
in
this
case
not
to
be
victim-impact
evidence
within
the
meaning
of
the
maryland
statute.
this
evidence
did
come
in
as
victim
impact
evidence.
it
was
introduced,
read
to
the
jury
as
a
victim
impact
statement.
i
think
it
is
distinguishable,
however,
from
the
victim
impact
evidence
that
came
in
booth
in
the
sense
that
it
is
the
total
other
end
of
the
spectrum.
the
victim
impact
statement
that
came
in
booth
was
inflammatory.
it
contained
a
cause,
possibly
for
the
death
penalty;
it
commented
on
the
evidence;
it
described
in
great
detail
the
sufferings
of
the
children
and
grandchildren
of
the
victims.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
yes,
i
was,
justice
blackmun.
and
i
think
this
is
an
opportunity
for
the
court
to
rethink
its
holding
in
booth.
i
think
the
decision
in
booth
goes
too
far.
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
limit
booth
to
the
context
and
uphold
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
case
by
saying
that
it
is
okay
to
consider
the
victim,
the
victim
himself;
not
the
victim's
children
or
grandchildren,
or
call
for
the
death
penalty;
clearly
that's
bad.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
the
victim
impact
evidence
in
booth
included
all
of
those
things,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
it
is
not,
justice
marshall,
and
i
beg
the
court's
indulgence.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
charles
o.
monk,
ii
--understanding
that,
justice
scalia,
let
me
just
make
one
more
point
about
how
this
court
might
distinguish
the
decision
in
that
case
from
this
case:
this
victim
was
the
lowest
part
of
humanity.
he
was
a
convicted
felon
in
jail
and
he
was
murdered
by
his
cell
buddy.
the
victim
impact
in
this
case
came
in
only
to
give
some
humanity
to
him,
so
when
the
jury
tried
to
determine
what
the
loss
to
society
was
from
this
life,
they
at
least
understood
who
this
victim
was.
can
it
be
that
this
court
intends
for
victim
impact
to
be
so
excluded
that
it
would
simply
give
the
victim
a
number?
"this
is
number
28,
and
we
never
have
to
know
anything
about
the
victim.
"
so
that
when
a
jury
is
making
that
ultimate
determination,
that
moral
judgment,
what
was
the
loss
of
society
from
this
victim?
they'll
never
know
who
he
was
or
what
his
contribution
to
society
was...
i
think
that
really
goes
too
far,
and
i
think
there
is
a
principled
reason
that
the
court
could
say
booth
was
right
because
it
was
outrageous,
goes
way
beyond
what
we
can
tolerate,
but
that
some
evidence
about
the
victim
alone
tempered
by
the
trial
judge's
admonition
to
avoid
undue
prejudice,
could
be
appropriate.
thank
you.
