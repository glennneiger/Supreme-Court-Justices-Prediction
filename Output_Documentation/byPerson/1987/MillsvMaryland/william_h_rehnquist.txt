very
well,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
to
support
your
hypothesis.
i
mean,
we
have
the
return
forms
by
the
jury
and
the
instructions;
and
they
tally
perfectly.
your
hypothesis
is
that
some
jurors
might
have
reasoned
a
different
way.
but
there
is
simply
no
indication
that
they
did.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
are
going
to
leave
to
your
briefs
whatever
questions
there
may
be
as
to
whether
the
introduction
of
this
evidence
was
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
understood
the
state
to
argue
it
was
not
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
burns.
mr.
monk,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
was
mr.
burns'
response
that
the
form
didn't
give
them
any
opportunity
to
express,
yet
if
there
were,
but
if
there
were
none,
non-unanimity?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
want
one
for
the
jury
to
hang.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
wouldn't
be
a
limitation
of
the
booth
holding
was
that
the
particular
impact
evidence
there
had
to
be
excluded.
everything
else
is
dicta.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
monk.
mr.
burns,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
monk.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-5367,
mills
versus
maryland
