justice
stevens
would
you
go
through
it
for
me
once
more?
you
know,
this
is
kind
of
a
hard
case
to
follow.
justice
stevens
the
difference
between
the
state
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
if
there
was
disagreement
on
one
mitigating
factor,
the
consequence
would
be
mistrial?
justice
stevens
i
thought
the
state
court
of
appeals
said
the
form
would
be
left
blank
on
such
a--
justice
stevens
before
you
get
to
the
other
question,
too,
in
your
brief,
you
list
seven
potentially
mitigating
circumstances
on
page
4.
and
i
gather
the
defense
lawyer
did
argue
those
to
the
jury?
justice
stevens
do
you
interpret
the
jury's
finding
that
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances
to
mean
that
they
didn't
think
that
these
were
factually
correct,
or
that
if
indeed
the
man
had
a
low
i.q.,
we
don't
consider
that
mitigating?
justice
stevens
did
the
judge
give
them
any
help?
justice
stevens
wasn't
there
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
terminated
his
education
at
the
sixth
grade?
justice
stevens
was
that
a
disputed
fact?
justice
stevens
so
what
they're
saying
in
effect
is,
these
facts
are
not
sufficiently
sufficient
even
to
be
justified
as
to
be
called
mitigating,
so
we
don't
have
to
even
weigh
them,
which
is
quite
different,
per
se.
justice
stevens
we
find
these
facts
but
we
think
the
aggravating
circumstances
are
much
more
serious?
justice
stevens
well,
it
has
to
be
more
than
that:
you
have
one
juror
who
thinks
there
should
be
death,
and
12
jurors
who
find
the
particular
aggravating
circumstances.
justice
stevens
but
you're
saying
that
if
one
juror
finds
no
mitigating
circumstances,
nothing
that
he
would
regard
as
mitigating,
and
12
agree
with
him
that
this
was
a
murder
committed
in
prison
or
whatever
the
aggravating
factor
is,
and
all
eleven
think
there
are
mitigating
circumstances,
then
the
statute
mandates
death,
does
it
not?
justice
stevens
well,
even
under
this
form
it
would?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
to
be
sure...
it's
kind
of
hard
to
keep
this
complicated
case
in
mind;
did
maryland
law
at
the
time
of
this
trial
require
that
any
finding
of
a
mitigated
circumstance
be
unanimous?
justice
stevens
in
this
opinion.
justice
stevens
had
it
previously
done
that?
was
there
anything
in
the
text
of
the
statute--
justice
stevens
--if
the
statutes
so
required,
how
could
they
authorize
the
new
form?
justice
stevens
so
there
was
no
statutory
requirement
that
a
finding
of
no
mitigating
circumstances
be
unanimous?
justice
stevens
you
mean
the
rule
adopted
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
was
there
a
rule
other
than
the
rule
approving
of
this
form,
or
was
that
the
rule?
justice
stevens
so
to
the
extent
the
form
was
ambiguous,
or
at
least
as
the
dissenting
justice
in
the
court
of
appeals
thought,
that
ambiguity
would
also
have
existed
in
the
rule?
justice
stevens
and
so
when
the
adopted
a
new
form,
they
basically
changed
the
law
under
your
view?
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
they
did
change
the
law?
justice
stevens
let
me
just
clarify
one
other
thing:
i
am
correct,
am
i
not,
that
the
judge
did
not
specifically
tell
them
what
to
do
if
the
situation
should
arise
that
they
were
not
unanimous
on
a
mitigating
circumstance?
other
than
the
general
statement
that
there
must
be
unanimity?
justice
stevens
what
about
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
particular,
six
or
seven
different,
mitigating
circumstances,
but
if
there
was
not
unanimity
on
one
of
the
mitigating
circumstances,
did
he
tell
them
what
to
do
there?
he
didn't
tell
them
to
leave
it
blank,
is
what
i'm
really
asking?
justice
stevens
but
what
is
the
reason
for
requiring
unanimity
when
you
find
you
are
not
agreed
that
there
is
a
mitigating
circumstance?
it's
a
little
different
than
in
the
normal
situation.
than
that
little
form
indicated
recognizes.
justice
stevens
a
catch-all.
justice
stevens
all
right.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
some
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
on
which
he
relied
were
not
really
in
dispute
factually.
he
was
a
man
of
limited
education;
a
man
of
low
i.q.,
who
was
19
or
20
years
old...
i
can't
remember
what
it
was.
the
question
they
really
answered
there
was
whether
they
thought
what
was
described
as
a
mitigating
circumstance
really
was
entitled
to
that
label.
i
think,
because
there
really
was...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
that?
justice
stevens
i
understand
on
that
one,
but
on
the
sixth
grade
education
and
the
low
i.q.
i
know
they're
not
one
of
the
enumerated
ones.
justice
stevens
but
you
suggest
that
no
juror,
none
of
the
12
jurors,
you
are
satisfied
that
none
of
the
12
jurors...
you
certainly
not
saying
that
none
of
those
facts
were
correct?
that
he
didn't
have--
justice
stevens
--correct.
justice
stevens
and
so
what
they're
really...
because
what
the
facts
were
essentially
undisputed,
they
are
really
saying
none
of
us
think
that
a
low
i.q.
or
a
sixth
grade
education
has
any
mitigating
value
at
all?
justice
stevens
that
is
probably
what
they
concluded.
rather
than
that
they
were
not
convinced
unanimously
that
those
factors
should
be
considered
mitigating.
which
is
what
the
dissenting
judge
apparently
found?
justice
stevens
that's
right.
justice
stevens
that
he
did
not
tell
them.
justice
stevens
i
shouldn't
be
interrupting
you
so
much.
but
may
i
ask
you
a
historical
question
that
there
was
reference
that
justice
kennedy
made:
has
there
ever
been
a
case
in
maryland
in
which
a
jury
filled
out
everything
in
the
form
except
one
mitigating
circumstance,
including
a
recommendation
of
death,
and
then
the
judge
said,
"they
obviously
were
hung
on
the
mitigating
circumstance,
so
it
must
be
a
life
sentence?
"
justice
stevens
but
the
jury
was
hung
on
the
ultimate
determination,
too?
justice
stevens
the
thing
that's
unlikely,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
way
that
things
happen
in
real
life,
is
that
they
would
come
to
the
unanimous
conclusion
that
there
should
be
a
death
sentence,
but
that
they
should
be
hung
on
an
intermediate...
a
mitigating
circumstance,
and
they
leave
that
blank.
and
i
gather
that
has
never
happened.
whereas,
if
it
did
happen,
you
are
telling
me
the
judge
would
look
at
the
form
and
impose
a
life
sentence?
justice
stevens
even
though
they
filled
out
the
rest
of
the
form,
they
said...
they
said
that
even
one
mitigating
blank,
filled
everything
else
out
that
would
qualify
for
a
capital...
for
the
death
sentence,
the
judge
would
then
under
maryland
law
have
a
duty
to
impose
the
life
sentence,
just
because
of
that
one
blank
in
the
form?
justice
stevens
counsel,
at
page
141
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
majority
opinion
discusses
in
the
first
full
paragraph
the
jury's
duty,
and
as
i
understand
it,
if
the
jury
is
hung
on
mitigating,
they
go
ahead
on
aggravating
anyway?
