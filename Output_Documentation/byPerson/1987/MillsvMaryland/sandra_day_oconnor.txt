justice
o'connor
mr.
burns,
i
take
it
the
defendant
in
this
case
made
no
objection
to
the
use
of
this
particular
form,
and
made
no
objections
to
the
instructions
given
at
the
time?
justice
o'connor
so
for
you
to
prevail,
we
would
have
to
find
that
the
error
amounted
to
plain
error,
if
it
existed
at
all?
justice
o'connor
well,
at
least
we
know
that,
on
this...
the
form
that
this
jury
returned,
they
at
least,
the
jurors
indicated
they
unanimously
agreed
that
none
of
the...
there
were
no
mitigating
factors.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
fact
is,
though,
we
have
a
situation
where
they've
indicated
unanimously
that
they
don't
find
any
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
or
any
at
all.
justice
o'connor
weren't
they
told
several
times
in
the
instructions
they
had
to
be
unanimous
on
all
their
findings
as
to
mitigation?

of
what?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
monk,
does
any
jury
form
in
an
ordinary
case,
let's
talk
about
a
capital
case
for
a
minute.
you
are
deciding,
you
are
asking
the
jury
to
decide
whether
the
defendant
is
guilty
or
not
guilty.
now
does
the
verdict
form
in
your
state
ever
have
another
blank
for
them
to
indicate
if
they're
hung,
or
are
they
just
given
"guilty"
or
"not
guilty"
and
you
must
be
unanimous?
justice
o'connor
and
isn't
that
what
most
states
do?
there's
never
another
form
for
if
they're
hung,
is
there?
