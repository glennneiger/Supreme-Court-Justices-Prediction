where
is
the
one
that
was
used
in
this
case?
justice
white
fourteen?
justice
white
and
also
14
of
the
brief?
justice
white
my
gosh?
justice
white
where
was
"cryptic"
in
here?
justice
white
i
think
you
ought
to
talk
about
this
case
as
though
there
hadn't
been
a
new
form
published
and
just
you
are
faced,
then,
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
the
form
that
was
used
in
this
case
was
perfectly
adequate.
justice
white
well,
that's
your
problem.
justice
white
it's
just
as
likely
that
there
was
unanimity,
actual
unanimity.
justice
white
well,
there
could
have
been.
justice
white
it's
not
unusual.
justice
white
what
point
are
you
making?
justice
white
as
i
read
your
brief,
and
as
i
seem
to
have
the
same
notion
now,
you
don't
think
you
need
to
go
through
the
routine
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
to
sustain
this?
justice
white
and
if
eleven
jurors
thought
there
was
a
mitigating
circumstance
and
one
thought
not,
they
had
to...
the
jury
had
to
proceed
on
the
basis
that
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances?
justice
white
so
you
say
that
under
that
instruction,
the
way
it
would
work
out
is
that
there
couldn't
have
been
a
hold-out
juror;
there
couldn't
have
been
a
hold-out
juror?
justice
white
and
the
tender
would
have
been
another
proceeding?
justice
white
under
the
maryland
rules
there
would
have
been
a
hung
jury?
justice
white
and
life
imprisonment?
justice
white
what
do
you
do
with
the
petitioner's
argument
when
he
points
out
that
the
form
had
been
used
25
or
30
times
and
the
"no's"
were
filled
out
in
every
case
all
the
same,
and
then
when
they
changed
the
form,
blanks
began
to
occur?
justice
white
if
somebody
felt
like
leaving
something
blank
under
the
old
form
there
would
just
have
been
a
hung
jury?
justice
white
and
it
would
have
been
life
imprisonment.
justice
white
so
that
the
new
form
would
make
it
more
likely
that
death
would
be
imposed?
justice
white
anyway.
justice
white
do
you
think
that
your
rationale
for
affirmance
is
the
same
as
the
court
of
appeals
used?
justice
white
wouldn't
it
be
better
to
introduce
it
to
the
jury
if
they
answered
this
way?
justice
white
arguably
those
instructions
and
those
forms
said
you
should
answer
no
to
a
mitigating
circumstance
unless
you're
unanimous
that
it
exists?
justice
white
in
order
to
find
there
is
a
mitigating
circumstance,
you
must
be
unanimous?
justice
white
you
can't
say
that
we
must
accept
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
construction
of
the
form
that
you
were
talking
about,
and
yet
not
accept
it
for
another
reason.
justice
white
well,
if
we're
free
to
do
that,
why
i
suppose
we're
free
to
accept
the
state's
submission?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
because
one
or
the
other;
but
there's
nothing
to
bar
us...
we're
not
legally
barred.
justice
white
no,
it
can't.
we
usually
don't
disagree
with
state
courts
on
their
construction
of
their
own
law;
their
own
justice;
but
you're
asking
us
to
do
what?
justice
white
well,
they
said
you
did.
