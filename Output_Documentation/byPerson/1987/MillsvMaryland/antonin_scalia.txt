justice
scalia
before
you
go
on,
i
guess
i
have
two
different
versions
of
the
jury
form
here.
justice
scalia
which
is
the
true
version?
justice
scalia
where
is
that?

page
99.
justice
scalia
and
the
second
one
was
not
used
in
this
case?
justice
scalia
it
was
fun,
trying
to
you
know--
justice
scalia
"will
the
real
form
please
stand
up?
"
0
[mirth.]
justice
scalia
--wait,
what
do
you
mean,
"he
would
remember"?
how
could
he
fail
to
remember
when--
justice
scalia
--well,
because
it
walks
you
through
it,
and
in
the
determination
of
sentence,
it
says,
"(1)
if
all
of
the
answers
in
section
one
are
marked
"no",
do
this;
if
section
two
is
completed
and
all
of
the
answers
are
marked
"no",
then
enter
death.
"
"it
doesn't
take
a
whole
lot
of
memory;
it
just
takes
reading
the
form.
"
"if
all
of
them
were
not
marked
"no"--
"
justice
scalia
--if
one
of
them
was
left
blank,
that
means
that
all
of
them
are
not
marked
"no".
that
doesn't
take
a
whole
lot
of
ingenuity
to
figure
out.
justice
scalia
you
mean
your
second
point
is
your
first
point?
justice
scalia
they're
one
and
the
same,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
scalia
you
can
always
make
somebody
that's
tolerably
good
better.
i
don't
think
that
we
should
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
that
this
form
could
have
been
improved.
justice
scalia
i
do
have
one
further
question.
you
also
are
assuming
on
the
first
point
about
the
form,
you're
assuming
without
arguing
that,
if
the
form
did
require...
if
it
was
misleading,
and
if
the
jury
indeed
didn't
realize
that
they
had
to
be
unanimous
as
to
no
mitigating
circumstance,
then
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
scalia
it
would
still
allow
all
mitigating
circumstances
to
be
taken
into
account;
it
would
be
a
state
saying
if
a
jury
unanimously
finds
one
aggravating
circumstance,
they
are
entitled
to
consider
all
mitigating
circumstances,
but
if
they
find
a
mitigation,
once
they've
unanimously
found
one
of
these
aggravating
circumstances,
they
have
to
find
it
unanimously.
and
you're
think
it's
all
that
clear
that
that's
unconstitutional?
it
doesn't
narrow
the
jury's
discretion;
it
prevents
frivolous
and
irrational
and
inconsistent
decisions
quite
well.
justice
scalia
i
don't
know...
suppose
it
only
takes
one
to
find
a
mitigating
circumstance,
and
that's
going
to
be
enough?
or
a
majority
you
can
say
you
know
it's
the
difference
whether
you
die
or
not
depends
on
whether
it's
six
or
seven-five
one
way
or
seven-five
the
other
way.
how
arbitrary
life
is?
you
can
say
that
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
system
you
adopt.
it's
always
going
to
turn
on
one
vote,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
zero
versus
one
against,
and
you
think
it
should
be
seven
versus
five.
i
don't
see
that
that
rises
that
one
seems
terribly
arbitrary
and
the
other
one
doesn't.
maybe
one
is
harsher
than
the
other.
i
can
understand
that.
but
i
don't
see
how
one
is
capricious.
justice
scalia
where
is
that
in
the
materials
here?
i'd
like
to
look
at
what
he
told
them
just
before
they
went--
justice
scalia
can
i
ask
you,
general
monk
about
perhaps
another
portion
of
the
form?
i
still
hope
i'm
using
the
right
one.
it's
on
16a
and
17a.
now
we're
past
section
ii,
where
we
have
to
mark
"yes",
or
"no"
and
we
have
established
that
they
only
mark
"no"
if
they
unanimously
find
no
mitigating
circumstance,
right?
justice
scalia
and
they
leave
it
blank.
if
only
eleven
of
them
find
a
mitigating
circumstance,
right?
then
they
move
on
to
section
iii
of
the
form
which
begins
at
the
bottom
of
16a
and
goes
over
to
the
top
of
17a...
"we
unanimously
find
that
it
has
been
proven
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
mitigating
circumstances
marked.
"
yes
"outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances
marked"
yes.
"right"?
justice
scalia
so,
if
they've
left
some
of
those
forms
blank,
by
reason
of
the
fact
there
are
only
11
of
them
that
think
that
they're
mitigating,
there
are
really
only
still
in
the
balancing,
they
are
only
going
to
balance
those
mitigating
circumstances
that
have
been
unanimously
found,
so
they
would
check...
and
let's
assume
that,
on
the
basis
of
those,
that
a
few
of
them,
or
there
are
none
of
them,
they
check
that
"no",
they
don't
outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances.
that
moves
them
on
to
the
last
part
of
the
form,
determination
of
sentence,
okay,
and
they
go
down
to
number
four,
"if
section
iii
is
completed
and
was
marked
'no.
"
enter
death,
"they'd
come
back
with
the
death
sentence
wouldn't
they?
"
and
the
only
way
you
would
know
that
you
had
a
hung
jury
is
if
the
judge
didn't
just
look
at
the
bottom
of
the
form,
but
went
back
and
looked
in
section
ii
and
saw,
"by
god,
they
came
in
with
a
death
sentence,
but
i
know
that
that's
wrong
because
in
fact
some
of
the
portions
of
section
ii
are
marked
neither
checked
yes
or
no.
"
isn't
that
the
only
way
you
can
get
a
hung
jury?
the
jury
would
not
know
itself
to
be
hung.
it
would
go
right
through
to
the
end
of
the
form,
come
in
with
a
death
penalty,
and
the
judge
would
find
out
they're
hung
because
there
were
no
answers
to
section
ii.
justice
scalia
okay,
tell
me
why
not?
justice
scalia
you
must
be
unanimous?
how
can
a
judge
instruct
them
to
be
unanimous?
justice
scalia
you
mean
they'd
come
back
out
and
say,
we
cannot
finish
section
ii.
we
cannot
get
unanimity
on
either
yes
or
no,
that's
what
you
are
saying?
justice
scalia
well,
it
certainly
could
have
been
a
lot
clearer.
it's
hard
to
believe
that
in
a
matter
of
this
importance,
those
instructions
could
be
drafted
in
that
way.
justice
scalia
just
to
read
them,
they
certainly
don't
leap
out
and
mean
that
to
me.
justice
scalia
it's
even
rarer
that
the
wins
the
first
time
and
loses
the
second.
