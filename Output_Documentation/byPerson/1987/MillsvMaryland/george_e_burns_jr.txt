mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
rather
intriguing
problem
of
cryptography.
the
cryptogram
in
question
is
contained
in
the
maryland
capital
sentencing
proceeding
used
in
this
case.
it
sets
forth
on
page
14
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
and
i
quote,
"based
upon
the
evidence,
we
unanimously
find
that
each
of
the
following
mitigating
circumstances,
which
is
marked
"yes",
has
been
proven
to
exist
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
each
mitigating
circumstance
marked
"no"
has
not
been
proven
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
"
the
court
of
appeals
determination
is
that
a
reasonable
juror
reading
that
language
will
conclude
that
even
though
there
is
only
the
possibility
on
the
form
for
"yes",
and
"no",
that
there
are
actually
three
possibilities;
that
you
have
all
agreed
for
"yes";
all
agreed
for
"no",
or
you
have
a
split
decision.
then
this
reasonable
juror,
without
being
instructed
to
do
so
will
conclude
that,
"if
i
disagree
i'll
leave
it
blank.
"
"then
i
will
retain
the
memory
of
my
mitigating
circumstance,
and
when
it
comes
to
weighing
aggravating
and
mitigating,
i
as
an
individual
juror
will
weigh
this,
even
though
my
other
jurors
may
not.
"
none
of
this
with
instructions
to
do
that.
an
additional
problem,
however,
is
precisely
the
same
language
with
the
substitution
of
"beyond
a
reasonable
doubt",
for
"preponderance
of
the
evidence",
is
used
to
preface
the
aggravating
circumstance.
now
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
in
maryland
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
is
that
simply
they
are
either
unanimous
or
it
doesn't
exist.
so
that,
once
again
our
reasonable
juror,
when
he
comes
upon
this
language
in
the
aggravating
circumstances,
he
looks
at
this
language
and
says,
"the
only
possibility
is
either
we
all
agree
or
it
doesn't
exist.
"
a
few
moments
later,
encountering
precisely
the
same
language,
a
reasonable
juror
who
is
now
somewhat
schizophrenic
concludes,
"this
language
must
mean
something
different
now:
it
means
indeed
that
there
is
a
third
possibility...
this
leaving
it
blank.
"
i
submit
is
the
test,
unless
it
becomes
a
schizophrenic
rather
than
reasonable,
juror,
it
is
difficult
to
accept
the
court
of
appeal's
interpretation.
moreover,
there
are
several
external
factors
cutting
against
this
interpretation.
first
of
all--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
apologize
to
you,
justice
scalia,
there
are
two
different
versions.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
the
one
that
was
used
in
this
case
is
quoted
in
this
case
is
quoted
in
the
brief
and
is
contained
in
the
joint
appendix.
the
one
printed
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
is
the
on
that
was
a
modification
with
style
only.
there
is
also
a
third
one,
which
is
also
included
in
the
appendix
which
is
also
the
one
propounded
subsequent
to
this
case.
so
let
me
go
back:
there
are
actually
three
forms
in
maryland,
the
one
used
in
this
case,
and
the
one
that
the
language
i
quoted
comes
from.
a
second
one
where
that
language
was
changed
slightly,
but
as
pointed
out
by
judge
macauliffe
in
his
dissent,
just
for
stylistic
purposes?
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
that
is
in
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
what
i've
been
working
on.
that's
unfortunately...
that's
not.
that's
the
modification
that
was
not
used
in
this
case,
but
we
put
it
there--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--in
this
case
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at,
i
believe--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--no,
99
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
and
14
is
the
quote.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
it
is
somewhat
confusing.
there
are
three,
and
that
is
just
to
say,
justice
scalia,
that
there
is
a
third
one,
and
perhaps
in
some
ways
that
is
the
most
significant:
that's
the
one
about
a
month
after
this
case
there
was
an
emergency
change
instituted.
that
one
is
also
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
page
let's
see...
21a.
so
we
have
three.
the
last
one
is,
was
not
used
but
was
changed
as
a
result
of
this
case.
indeed,
about
a
month
after
this
case--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--the
second
one
was
not
used
in
the
case.
we
only
put
it
there...
and
perhaps
we
shouldn't
have,
for
information
to
the
court
that
existed.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
apologize.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
actually,
justice
scalia,
when
i
was
looking
over
this
case
yesterday,
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
whatever
reason
we
thought
for
putting
that
second
form
in
there
was
probably
not
good;
it
is
somewhat
confusing,
and
i
apologize
for
that.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
yes,
justice
white,
and
i
seem
to
have
gotten
lost
in
the
"cryptic"
avenue
in
this
instance,
but
i
think
that
the
forms
are,
this
first
form
is...
and
the
second
one
is
not
real
important
anyway.
it's
just
a
stylistic
change.
and
the
new
form,
as
i
think
the
court
will
note,
the
new
form
is,
at
best,
a
distant
cousin
to
the
first
form.
it
specifically
sets
out
the
possibility
you
either
all
agree;
you
don't
agree;
you're
divided;
and
you
mark
three
alternatives
for
each
mitigating,
you
mark
according
to
these
three
possibilities.
at
the
end
of
that
form
it
provides
each
juror
to
individually
assess
what
he
thought;
she
thought;
the
mitigating
factors
were.
so
if
you
had
a
situation
where
six
jurors
thought
there
were
five
mitigating
factors;
and
six
didn't;
those
six
jurors
would
weigh
those
mitigating
factors
against
the
aggravating.
in
short,
i
think
it
is
very
difficult
to
accept
the
court
of
appeals'
assurance
that
every
juror
who
understood
the
first
form,
when
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
necessary
on
an
emergency
basis
to
drastically
change
that
form.
i
also
think
it
is
worth
pointing
out,
as
the
dissenter
did
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
prior
to
this
case,
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
juror
ever
indicated
in
any
way
that
there
was
a
divided
jury
on
any
mitigating
circumstance.
subsequent
to
this
case
there
was
an
opportunity
in
the
forms
and
instructions
to
show
division,
two
of
the
three
capital
cases
that
were
decided
jurors
indeed
demonstrated
that
they
were
split
on
some
mitigating
factors.
i
think
that
the
dissent
persuasively
points
out
that
it
defies
reason
to
suppose
this
is
all
a
matter
of
coincidence.
i
also
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
interplay
between
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
and
the
brief
of
the
state
in
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
this
reasonable
juror
is
going
to
sit
around
and
think
of
a
rather
intricate
procedure
to
follow,
even
with
instructions.
the
state,
on
its
part,
disagrees
with
the
court
of
appeals.
indeed,
the
state
says
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
in
how
they
interpret
the
statute.
the
state
says
that
what
the
statute
actually
meant
was
that
if
you
disagree,
any
disagreement,
any
mitigating
factor;
hung
jury;
mistrial.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
rejected
that
interpretation
in
its
opinion.
the
point
of
this,
i
think,
on
the
one
hand
we
have
the
court
of
appeals
offering
an
interpretation
in
which
it
then
says
every
reasonable
juror
would
have
understood.
yet
the
state,
even
to
this
day,
doesn't
understand
that
interpretation.
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
offers
us
an
interpretation
that
the
court
of
appeals
says
it's
wrong
and
didn't
understand.
i
submit
that
if
the
state
and
the
court
of
appeals
can't
agree,
it's
far
too
much
and
far
to
optimistic
to
assume
somehow
that
this
hypothetical
reasoning
juror
would
have
understood
all
this,
or
indeed,
any
of
it.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
understand,
justice
stevens.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
no.
the
court
of
appeals
says
a
juror
would
conclude
that
we
leave
this
blank,
and
then
i,
but
if
i
found
the
mitigating
factor,
i'm
the
only
juror
that
did...
if
i
found
that
mitigating
factor,
when
we
weigh
aggravating
and
mitigating,
in
my
mind,
i
would
weigh
them
and
at
that
point
i
might
decide
that
even
if
i
found
this
mitigating,
aggravating
still
outweighed
mitigating,
you
could
have
death...
or
it
could
be
the
other
way.
the
state
position's
the
other.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
that
was
their
conclusion...
their
conclusion
was
that
that
particular
part
of
the
form
would
be
left
blank,
and
that
that
juror
would
know
to
leave
it
blank
and
he
would
remember
that
he's
entitled
in
the
final
analysis
to
use
that
mitigating
circumstance.
now,
the
state's
position
is
not
that.
the
state's
position
in
their
brief--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--oh,
i
think
he
would
remember.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
but
it
presupposes,
of
course,
that
you
understood
in
the
beginning
that
you
could
leave
it
blank,
and
that
you
were
entitled
on
an
individual
basis.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
they're
related,
justice
scalia.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
because
if
you
look
at
the
new
form,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
necessary
to
add
specific
language
at
the
end,
saying
that
each
individual
juror
would
do
this.
so
apparently
the
court
of
appeals,
notwithstanding
their
opinion
in
mills,
wasn't
so
sure
jurors
would
understand
unless
they
were
told.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
just
looking
at
the
forms,
we
don't
really
have
much
in
terms
of
making
good
better,
we
have
here,
if
you
weren't
familiar
with
the
statute,
i'd
be
willing
to
bet
that
i
could
show
these
two
to
any
lawyer
and
you
would
never
guess
that
they
came
from
the
same
state.
these
forms
are
decidedly
different.
and
i
think
it
is
difficult
on
the
one
hand
to
say
that
it's
important
and
certainly
good
to
explain
all
these
things,
but
the
same
thing
could
have
presumably
been
accomplished
if
we
said
we
use
this
form
but
we
give
all
these
instructions.
but
the
point
is,
these
are
decisive
differences
between
these
two
forms.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
said
that,
justice
white--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so,
because
as
i
pointed
out,
one
of
the
problems
that
i
see
besides
the
instructions
not
directing
the
jury
to
do
any
of
these
mental
gymnastics,
the
other
problem
is
this
language
using
the
same
language
in
the
aggravating
and
the
mitigating,
yet
at
the
same
time
saying
the
juror
without
being
told
to
do
so,
is
going
to
have
to
treat
it
in
a
different
way,
although
it's
the
same
language
in
the
aggravating
and
mitigating.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
that
is
true,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor,
because,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
it
on
this
basis.
and
i
think
what
it
really
comes
down
to,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right,
of
course,
there
is
no
problem;
everyone
understood
and
these
were
all
the
instructions
you
were
entitled
to.
if
we're
right,
what
we're
saying
is
no
rational
person
could
have
possibly
understood
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
today
in
this
case
said,
and
therefore,
no
one
would
have
objected
because
no
one
would
have
thought
this
was
really
what
it
meant.
so
i
think
in
this
case,
and
in
a
normal
case,
that
would
be
true.
but
i
think
the
two
problems
here
procedurally,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide
it
on
that;
and
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
decided
it...
and
our
position
being
that
the
court
of
appeals
obviously
has
the
right
to
interpret
the
statute,
but
they
don't
have
the
right
to
interpret
it
in
a
dramatically
new
way,
and
then
apply
it
to
this
petitioner.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
they
did,
justice
o'connor,
but
of
course,
there
is
no
evidence
to
show,
and
they
were
certainly
never
told,
that
if
you
look
at
the
instructions,
it
was
clear,
"unanimous...
yes
or
no",
they
weren't
told
anything
about
this
possibility,
that
perhaps
if
you're
not
unanimous,
you
still
may
retain
your
individual
judgment--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--well,
we
have
a
form.
our
position
is
we
have
a
situation
where
they
have
indicated
that
it's
not
unanimous
that
they
find
one.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
and
that,
i
think
is
the
court
of
appeals'
position
is,
there
is
more
than
that:
there
is
also
a
finding
that
they
necessarily
unanimously
don't
find
the
non-existence;
that
is,
the
opposite.
the
problem,
of
course,
is
that
there
is
nothing,
no
instruction,
even
coming
close
talking
about
that
case.
nothing
on
the
form
talking
about
that
case;
and
so
what
it
really
comes
down
to
is
a
matter
of
fate.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
they
were
told,
but
i
think
that
that
may
cut
the
other
way
because
i
think
they
would
also
be
told
the
other
thing
if
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
be
correct,
you
also
have
to
be
unanimous
on
the
lack
thereof.
because
if
you're
told
you
have
to
be
unanimous,
it
seems
to
me
that
jury
can
say
then,
"we
don't
find
it:
no.
"
"eleven
of
us
thought
it
was;
one
person
didn't
think
it
was;
therefore,
we
aren't
unanimous;
we
mark
"no".
"
that's
the
problem
i
think
in
this
case,
is
obviously
none
of
us
can
tell
what
went
on
in
the
jury
room,
but
i
think--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--the
problem,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
is
of
course,
our
position
is
under
these
forms,
there
is
no
way
they
would
have
any
way
to
communicate
that
to
anyone.
and
if
you
set
up
the
form
in
such
a
way,
and
set
up
the
instructions
in
such
a
way
that
you
don't
offer
the
possibility
of
this
third
possibility,
then
you're
never
going
to
get
the
third
possibility.
i
don't
think
it
means
it
doesn't
exist;
it
just
means
that
you've
presented
it
to
the
court
in
such
a
way,
that
unless
you
have
a
juror
that
is
very,
very
creative,
even
if
he
thinks
all
these
things,
or
even
if
eleven
of
them
thinks
them,
there
is
simply
nothing
in
the
form
that
they
can
show
that
to
the
court.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
there
could
have
been,
justice
white--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think
the
problem
is--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--the
court
of
appeals...
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
to
be
correct,
i
think,
has
to
be
more
than
a
toss
of
the
coin;
there
has
to
be
some
certainty;
and
if
the
only
certainty
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
get
is
if
you
have
very
specific
instructions
or
a
form
that
makes
it
clear
that
the
jury
knows
what
it
is
that
you
are
doing.
indeed,
i
think
it's
interesting
that
even
one
judge
at
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
he
would
have
never
have
imagined
this
system
and
could
nave
never
believed
that
anyone
thought
of
it;
no
one
had
ever
talked
about
it
in
the
past;
and
yet,
we're
asking
this
court
to
believe
that
jurors
on
their
own
were
fully
aware
of
all
these
subtleties,
that
i
think
are
fairly
difficult
at
this
point
to
understand.
as
to
the
victim-impact
issue,
i
would
only
comment
on
the
harmless
error
argument.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
think
depending
on
the
instructions--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--then
i
think
it
would
be
the
same.
because
i
think
these
instructions
fairly
cover
this
form,
so
i
think
either
way
you
have
the
instructions
and
the
form,
i
agree,
are
absolutely
consistent
in
this
case,
so
i
think
that
may
be
the
problem.
and
the
reason
i
asked
that,
justice
kennedy,
because
you
might
have
a
case
where
by
instructions,
obviously,
you
could
give
all
these
alternatives,
and
then
with
the
forms
that
we
would
say
is
inadequate,
it
might
be
okay.
but
in
this
case
you
had
instructions
obviously,
the
judge
thought
the
form
worked
that
way.
not
unreasonably.
as
to
the
harmless
error--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--he
did,
and
there
is
one
other
one
we
also
pointed
out
in
our
footnote
4,
they
didn't
argue,
he
argued
them,
yes.
there
was
evidence
presented
for
these
but
they
could
have
found
didn't.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
an
interesting
question,
justice
stevens.
i'm
not
sure
because,
again,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
a
juror
thought
about
this;
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--the
judge
gave
the
generally
set-out
routine
instructions;
he
did
not
specifically
say
that;
he
really
put
it
to
the
jury
and
said
that
you
consider
it,
and
they
do
consider
it.
now,
i
think
it's
possible,
obviously,
a
juror
could,
i
suppose,
in
a
case,
consider
them
factually,
but
most
of
these
things,
some
of
them
are
argumentative.
some
of
them
are--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--yes,
justice
stevens,
evidence
like
that.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
most
of
the
factual
things
were
not.
they
were
not
disputed.
so
it
would
seem
that
if
the
jury
all
concluded
that
it
was
not,
it
would
seem
that
their
finding
is
not
mitigating.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
think
so,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that's
a
fair
interpretation,
at
least
of
the
historical
fact.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
think
so,
justice
stevens.
i
think
it's
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
ones
that
at
least
present
more
or
less
historical
facts,
because
they
are
not
things
that
are
seriously...
or
at
all
disputed,
i
should
say.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
as
i
agreed,
there
certainly
has
not
been.
i
think
there
are
two
points:
one
is
the
procedural
point.
the
court
of
appeals
never
addressed
this
and...
perhaps
they
could
have
but
they
didn't...
to
say
that
there
was
any
procedural
bar
to
the
consideration.
but
the
second
point,
perhaps
more
importantly,
is
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct,
and
this
is
all
clear
to
everyone
there'd
be
no
reason
he'd
be
entitled
to
no
more
instructions.
if
we're
correct,
and
you
could
possibly
have
foreseen
what
the
court
of
appeals
says
this
means,
then
no
reasonable
person
would
have
foreseen
it
as
an
instruction.
so
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
that's
the
reason...
the
double
reason...
i
think
that's
perhaps
why
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
address
the
problem
whether
or
not
there
were
objections.
on
the
harmless
error
part,
the
victim
impact--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--yes,
of
course,
chief
justice.
if
you
have
any
questions,
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
them.
but
our
position
has
been
set
out
in
the
briefs.
but
of
course,
obviously
we're
relying
on
booth,
and
our
point
was,
i
think,
too,
(1)
that
the
court
of
appeals
simply
ignored
one
prong
of
the
booth
test;
and
the
state's
response
is
in
part
that
it's
harmless
because
there
were
no
mitigating
factors
brought
back;
the
state
arguing
you
can't
have
any
bad
influence
on
weighing
of
pendency.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
yes,
chief
justice,
and
obviously
we,
for
the
same
reasons
in
booth,
think
it
is.
if
you
have
any
further
questions,
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
them;
but
i
have
not,
obviously
repeated
them,
because
we
rely
absolutely
on
booth.
the
harmless
error
is
separate,
though,
and
that's
why
i
wanted
to
say
something
about
that,
the
argument
being
that
you
don't
have
a
weighing
and
balancing
because
there
are
no
mitigating;
therefore,
it's
harmless.
the
problem,
of
course,
is
if
you
have
improper
evidence
to
come
in,
then
that
also
affects
in
the
weighing
in
balance
perhaps
of
whether
you
decide
a
historical
fact
really
is
worth
bringing
back
a
mitigating.
so
the
prejudice
can
arise
before
you
get
to
the
weighing
and
balancing
between
aggravating
and
mitigating.
so
indeed,
i
suggest
it
cannot
be
harmless.
thank
you.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
yes,
justice
scalia.
the
reason
i
haven't
argued
it
is
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
that
it
was
unconstitutional;
but
decided
that
clearly
that
wasn't
going
to
be
the
law
in
maryland.
i
think,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
you
would
have
a
very
serious
constitutional
problem,
because
what
it
would
amount
to,
if
it
were
interpreted
as
we
originally
thought
it
was
to
be
interpreted,
you
could
have
in
essence
one
juror
deciding
you
were
going
to
get
capital
punishment,
even
though
eleven
disagree.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
it
may
be...
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that,
justice
scalia,
because
it
may
be
you
could
draft
the
statute,
getting
around
the
problem
of
unanimity,
but
i
think
here
you'd
have
a
fully
open
statute,
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is,
you'd
have
a
situation
literally
where
one
juror
says,
i
think
this
person
deserves
death;
i
don't
think
there
are
any
mitigating
factors.
eleven
jurors
think
there
are
13
mitigating
factors,
and
it's
simply
overwhelming.
and
yet,
the
one
juror,
that
is,
the
one
juror
rule,
if
you're
unlucky
to
get
one
juror
who
thinks
you
should
get
death;
then
you're
going
to
get
death.
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
understand
how
that
can
be
arbitrary,
because
what
you're
doing
in
that
case
is
saying,
the
biggest
single
test
would
be
not
mitigating
and
aggravating;
but
whether
you
get
one
juror
who
doesn't
think
you
deserve
the
mitigating.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
you
do
have
to
find
the
aggravating
as
a
practical
matter.
however,
if
you
look
at
these
aggravating
factors,
they're
usually
things
that
are
going
to
be
in
effect
having
litigated
at
trial,
the
most
common
one
is
felony-murder.
now,
if
you
found
someone
guilty
of
felony-murder,
you
logically,
for
example,
going
to
have
an
aggravating,
so
i
agree
you
have
to
have
the
aggravating.
but
in
very
few
of
these
cases--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--it
would
if
interpreted
the
way
justice
scalia
is
asking
the
question.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
under
this
form,
as
we
interpret
it,
yes.
in
that
sense
we're
in
agreement.
i'm
sorry
justice
scalia.
i
was
getting
to
the
constitutionality
question.
that's
true
we
do
interpret
it
in
that
way.
the
problem
with
the
constitutionality
is
that
you
would
have
the
situation,
if
you
were
right,
that's
the
exact
problem
that
you
have;
is
you
have
the
possibility
of
not
12
jurors
agreeing
but
one
juror
deciding
it's
death.
and
our
position,
of
course,
is
it's
difficult
to
imaging
a
more
arbitrary
system
than
luck
of
the
draw:
do
i
get
one
juror?
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
you
can
certainly
say
that,
justice
scalia,
but
we
draw
lines
every
day,
and
i
suggest
the
one
where
one's
enough
to
execute,
is
probably
a
line
no
one
really
wants
to
draw.
i
agree
with
you
that,
at
some
point,
for
example,
this
court
in
an
entirely
different
situation
talking
about
majority
verdicts
in
non-capital
cases
has
said
yes,
everything
is
arbitrary
and
we
may
tolerate
certain
ones
to
a
point.
we
draw
a
line.
but
we
do
have
to
draw
a
line,
and
under
this
interpretation
of
this
statute,
the
line
is
one
in
twelve,
and
i
suggest--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think
in
the
context
of
the
jury
system,
that
we're
looking
for
a
jury
of
12
people
to
decide
this
to
say
in
effect
we'll
tolerate
one
saying
it
is
capricious,
because
if
we
looked
at
the
jury,
and
even
if
we
had
the
seven-five,
we're
giving
some
play
to
the
notion
that
it's
the
group,
it's
the
jury,
deciding
it.
if
we're
looking
at
one,
it's...
i
don't
want
to
use
the
term,
"anti-democratic",
but
it
is
an
odd
notion
in
a
more
or
less
democratic
society,
of
this
extreme
decision
being
made
on
the
basis
of
one
as
opposed
to
eleven.
thank
you.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
initially,
i
think
the
crucial
problem
with
the
state's
position
as
i
now
understand
it
to
be,
is
the
court's
opinion
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix
at
136...
141,
curiously
there
is
not
one
word
about
a
new
law
announcing
new
forms;
what
the
court
says
is
petitioner
has
got
it
all
wrong;
this
is
what
it's
always
meant.
the
crucial
point
for
the
state
to
be
right
is
just
the
opposite.
it's
just
that
the
court
is
changing
the
law.
but
the
court
specifically
rejects
that.
and
when
the
court
does
that,
the
instruction
on
95,
of
course,
cuts
against
the
state's
case
because
you
only
need
yes
or
no,
and
the
court
very
clearly
at
139
and
140
says
we
always
imagine
the
jury
would
know
that
you
had
this
"maybe";
leave
it
blank.
on
the
victim
impact
i
would
only
say
that
i
don't
agree
with
the
state
that
anyone
is
in
the
lowest
rung
of
humanity.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
build
up
his
contribution
to
society
for
all
of
us
to
take
into
consideration
as
the
jury
does,
that
at
the
trial,
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
crime.
and
i
think
this
court
was
right
in
booth,
and
i'm
glad
to
see
mr.
monk
today
think,
in
at
least
most
respects,
that
he
was
wrong
on
that
day.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
justice
white,
i
never
said
you
shouldn't
accept
the
interpretation
of
what
the
jury
should
do.
my
only
contention
in
this
case
on
this
point
is
that
the
court
of
appeals'
position
is
untenable
that
a
jury
actually
with
these
instructions
in
this
form
could
have
done
that.
obviously,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
change
the
interpretation
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
as
what
it
should
mean.
but
the
question
here
is
in
this
case,
could
a
reasonable
juror
from
this
form
and
these
instructions
gather
all
of
the
materials
on
136...
141?
that's
our
position.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
justice
white--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--of
course
the
supreme
court
can
do
anything.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i'm
asking...
i'm
not
asking
at
all
to
say
their
construction
is
wrong;
i'm
simply
saying
if
this
is
the
correct
instruction
of
this,
we
get
the
benefit
of
these
instructions
and
this
sentencing
form.
that's
the
reason
that
it
was
unfair
in
this
case.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
that's
where
we
disagree
with
the
court.
but
that's
not
disagreeing
with
their
construction
of
the
law.
that's
just
disagreeing
with
their
interpretation
of
the
instructions
and
the
effect
of
the
form
in
this
case.
thank
you.
