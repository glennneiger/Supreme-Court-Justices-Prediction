mr.
attorney-general,
we
do
recognize,
don't
we,
that
nobody
at
these
two
tables
here,
nobody
here...
two
people,
agree
what
those
forms
mean,
yet
12
jury
men
can
easily
understand
it.
we
recognize
that,
don't
we?
justice
marshall
room
for
disagreement.
justice
marshall
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
rely
on
that
at
all,
did
they?
justice
marshall
it
didn't
did
they?
justice
marshall
it's
not
often
that
a
lawyer
gets
to
argue
the
same
case
twice.
