justice
blackmun
you
were
defending
that
in
booth,
weren't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
maryland
and
it
concerns
that
state's
capital
sentencing
system.
the
case
doesn't
blend
itself
very
well
though
announcement
from
the
bench.
it
involves
the
type
of
jury
verdict
form
that
was
employed
at
that
time
in
maryland.
i
think
it
must
suffice
to
say
that
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
insofar
as
it
sustained
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
upon
the
petitioner,
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings,
not
in
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
brennan
and
justice
white
each
have
joined
the
opinion
but
have
filed
brief
statements
in
concurrence.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
has
joined
therein
by
justice
o'connor,
justice
scalia,
and
justice
kennedy.
