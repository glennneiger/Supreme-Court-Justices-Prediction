justice
kennedy
i
just
want
to
ask
you
one
question
before
you
get
to
that:
if
the
jury
had
simply
been
instructed
orally
with
no
form,
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
justice
kennedy
the
instructions
would
be
the
same.
justice
kennedy
if
you
please
counsel,
one
more
question
on
this
point:
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
when
she
asked
you...
when
she
pointed
out
to
you
that
there
had
been
no
objection
below.
justice
kennedy
but
it
says,
if
they're
hung
as
to
mitigating,
they
go
on
in
any
event
to
determine
the
aggravating
circumstance?
