justice
scalia
as
the
government
points
out,
you
sued
the
postmaster
general
by
name,
rather
than
the
post
office,
and
had
717
not
spoken
to
what
happens
in
the
courtroom,
that
was
incorrect.
justice
scalia
well,
you
acknowledge
717
has
some
bearing
in
the
courtroom,
then?
justice
scalia
or
maybe
you
made
a
mistake.
justice
scalia
why
do
you
say
that
in
1972,
congress
created
a
cause
of
action,
rather
than
eliminate
the
cause
of
action?
justice
scalia
well,
i
thought
you
did.
justice
scalia
well,
justice
stevens
made
you
do
it.
that's
the
question
he
asked
and
you
agreed
with
that.
justice
scalia
against
the
post
office?
justice
scalia
well,
you
could
regard
that
as
reserving
sovereign
immunity,
or
you
could
regard
that
as
not
creating
a
cause
of
action.
and
i
don't
know
how
to--
justice
scalia
--yes,
but
there,
there
had
been
no
preceding
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
for
the
library
of
congress.
isn't
there
a
difference
when
the
sovereign
immunity's
already
been
waived,
you
don't
need
a
second
waiver.
but
you
did
need
the
first
waiver
there.
justice
scalia
what
are
you
quoting,
you
said
it
said,
congress
said
in
what?
what
are
we
talking
about?
it
is
a
floor
statement
or?
