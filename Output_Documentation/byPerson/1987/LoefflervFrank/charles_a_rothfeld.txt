mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
both
sides
in
this
case
agree
that
the
so-called
no
interest
rule
or
the
aptly
named
no-interest
rule
prevents
the
award
of
interest
to
virtually
all
federal
employees
who
obtain
title
vii
judgments
against
the
united
states.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
created
a
special
exception
to
this
limitation
on
title
vii
for
the
benefit
of
the
federal
workers
who
are
employed
by
the
postal
service,
a
benefit
that
gives
those
workers,
in
contrast
to
all
other
federal
employees,
a
right
to
interest
on
a
title
vii
awards.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we
don't
disagree
with
the
petitioners
as
a
general
matter
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
in
that
sort
of
proceeding,
a
contract-type
proceeding
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
which
may
entitle
it
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
took
away
the
waiver.
we
think
that
section
717
is
a
separate
waiver
and
it
is
the
dispositive
waiver
in
this
case.
also
i
think
the
way
in
which
congress
created
the
postal
service
and
the
way
in
which
it
regulated
the
relationship
between
the
postal
service
and
its
employees
provide
an
independent
reason.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we
think
that's
right.
we
think
this
is
a
case
about
title
vii,
it
was
brought
under
title
vii,
it
is
a
title
vii
case.
now,
obviously
before
anyone
obtains
any
kind
of
judgment
against
the
united
states,
there
must
be
two
things;
there
must
be
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
there
must
be
a
cause
of
action.
to
resolve
this
case,
the
court
must
do
two
things;
it
must
find
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
decide
if
the
waiver
which
is
controlling
here
is
broad
enough
to
allow
for
awards
of
interest.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
don't
think
that's
a
proper
characterization.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
the
argument
that
petitioner
makes.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
was
the
final
landing
place
for
the
petitioner.
and
i
think
that
there
are
two
responses
to
that.
one
involves
the
nature
of
the
waiver
which
is
controlling
here.
the
other
involves
the
nature
of
the
postal
service
and
its
relationship
to
its
employees.
answering
your
question
now,
in
particular,
we
think
that
that
analysis
that
it
was
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
which
was
the
waiver
here
and
that
title
vii
simply
created
a
cause
of
action
is
not
the
proper
way
to
view
this
case.
and
the
relationship
between
the
two
statutes
makes
that
quite
clear.
congress
passed
title
vii
in
1964
and
at
the
time,
it
preserved
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
by
excepting
from
the
definition
of
employer,
the
federal
government
including
the
old
post
office
department.
therefore,
no
part
of
the
federal
government
could
be
sued
under
title
vii
after
its
enactment
in
1964.
six
years
later
in
1970--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
it
was
both,
justice
scalia.
congress
typically
waives
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
as
we
think
it
did
in
this
case
by
enacting
a
cause
of
action.
the
cause
of
action
waives
the
sovereign
immunity
to
the
extent
that
the
cause
of
action
has
been
created,
and
therefore
they
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
the
court,
in
shaw,
for
example,
characterized
the
1972
provision
of
title
vii
as
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
was
those
provisions
which
created
the
cause
of
action.
in
the
usual
case,
there's
no
point
in
distinguishing
between
the
waiver
and
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
justice
stevens.
first,
let
me
just
spell
out
a
little
bit
how
the
system
worked
from
1964
to
1972.
in
1970,
when
congress
created
the
postal
service
it
preserved,
we
think,
the
sovereign
immunity
as
to
employment
discrimination
claims.
congress
specifically
considered
extending
to
the
postal
service
the
existing
private
sector
provisions
of
title
vii.
it
decided
not
to
do
that.
so
in
1970,
it
was
quite
clear
that
a
postal
employee
could
not
sue
the
federal
government
under
title
vii.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
they
were
doing
both.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
you
might
if
you're
suing
under
the
sue
or
be
sued
clause.
but
again,
we
think
it's--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
quite
right,
justice
stevens,
but
the
crucial
point
is
not
when
the
cause
of
action
was
created.
we
certainly
agree
that
causes
of
action
created
after
the
enactment
of
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
may
be
brought
under
that
clause.
but
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
clause
here
is
not
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
first,
congress
in
1972
when
it
enacted
the
federal
sector
provisions
of
title
vii
which
grant
a
remedy
for
employment
discrimination
to
all
federal
employees,
congress
viewed
that
as
you
say,
as
creating
a
cause
of
action.
it
also
clearly
said
at
the
time,
and
the
court
has
since
recognized
that
that
was
a
blanket
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
is
that
blanket
waiver
of
immunity
that
allows
all
title
vii
actions
against
the
government,
including
this
one,
to
proceed.
now,
the
fact
that
title
vii
was
extended
to
an
agency
like
the
postal
service
that
already
had
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
in
its
charter,
i
think,
is
a
matter
of
happenstance.
it
doesn't
affect
the
identity
of
the
waiver
of
the
statute
that's
waiving
immunity.
congress
viewed
that
blanket
waiver
as
the
waiver
which
made
these
suits
possible.
and
i
think
there
is
clear
textual
evidence
of
that,
and
that
is
the
second
reason
for
saying
that
it
is
title
vii
and
not
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
that
is
the
waiver
here.
those
two
provisions
actually
authorize
suits
against
different
named
defendants,
as
justice
scalia
noted.
section
717(c)
of
title
vii
waives
the
government's
immunity
in
suits
brought
against
the
head
of
the
defendant's
agency.
that
is
why
this
case
is
captioned,
loeffler
v.
tisch,
postmaster
general.
in
contrast,
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
makes
the
postal
service
amenable
to
suit
in
its
official
name.
and
that
is
why
a
typical
suit
that
is
brought
pursuant
to
the
clause
in
which
the
clause
is
the
waiver
is
captioned
something
like,
freed
v.
u.s.
postal
service.
now,
this
obviously
is
a
technical
distinction
but
it
has
real
significance.
the
courts
will
uniformly
dismiss
title
vii
actions
that
are
brought
against
the
agency
rather
than
against
the
agency
head.
that
means
that
this
case
can
proceed
only
because
it
is
title
vii
that
makes
the
postmaster
general
amenable
to
process.
and
if
it
is
title
vii
that
makes
the
defendant
amenable
to
suit,
it
must
be
title
vii
itself
that
provides
the
relevant
waiver
of
immunity
here.
now,
in
turn,
the
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
repeatedly
that
it
is
the
statute
waiving
immunity
that
sets
out
the
conditions
under
which
the
government
has
agreed
to
be
sued.
and
shaw
held
clearly
that
one
of
the
conditions
under
the
title
vii
waiver
is
that
it
does
not
authorize
awards
of
interest
to
employees
suing
any
part
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
short
answer
is
that
the
judgment
comes
out
of
the
u.s.
treasury.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
judgment
comes
in
particular
out
of
something
called
the
"postal
service
fund"
which
is
a
fund
created
in
the
postal
reorganization
act
in
which
postal
revenues
are
placed
and
postal
expenditures
are
made.
that
fund,
in
turn,
is
specifically
labeled
by
the
postal
reorganization
act
as
part
of
the
united
states
treasury.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes,
it
would--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
again,
it
comes
out
of
the
united
states
treasury.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that's
true.
that's
true.
but
i
mean,
i
should
emphasize
that
the
postal
budget
is
part
of
the
budget
of
the
united
states.
the
postal
service
in
allocating
expenditures
from
the
postal
fund,
which
as
i
said
is
part
of
the
federal
treasury,
will
send
its
budget
to
the
president.
the
president,
through
the
office
of
management
and
budget,
will
send
it
on
to
congress.
congress
approves
that
budget
as
part
of
the
united
states'
budget.
the
money
comes
out
of
the
federal
treasury,
out
of
the
postal
service
comes
out
of
the
federal
treasury
and
therefore
adds
to
the
federal
budget
deficit,
one
reason
why
congress
is
now
tinkering
with
the
postal
budget.
in
fact,
in
section
409
of
the
postal
reorganization
act
which
deals
with
suits
against
the
postal
service,
congress
specifically
categorized
judgments
paid
from
the
postal
fund
as
judgments
against
the
united
states
which
are
paid
out
of
the
postal
fund.
so
i
think
the
money
that's
at
stake
here
must
be
characterized
as
federal
money,
money
coming
out
of
the
united
states
treasury.
certainly,
without
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
an
express
waiver
somewhere,
petitioner
could
not
sue
and
get
its
hands
on
that
cash.
and
that
we
think
is
the
first
dispositive
reason
for
ruling
for
the
postal
service
here.
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
this
case
is
title
vii.
that
waiver
does
not
allow
for
awards
of
interest.
therefore,
the
express
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
the
only
waiver
that
allows
the
suit
to
proceed,
is
not
broad
enough
to
allow
them
to
obtain
awards
of
interest
under
this
court's
holding
in
shaw.
and
there
is
also,
as
i
suggested,
a
second
independent
reason
for
ruling
for
the
postal
service
in
this
case,
which
is
not
at
all
technical
or
sophisticated.
it's
a
simple
matter
of
congressional
intent.
even
if
it
is
true
that
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
is
the
source
of
the
waiver
here...
and
we
don't
think
that
it
is...
but
even
if
that
were
true,
all
that
would
mean
is
that
the
clause
allows
petitioner
to
bring
the
postal
service
into
court.
it
would
remain
title
vii
that
provides
the
cause
of
action.
it
would
remain
title
vii
that
defines
the
scope
of
the
relief
here.
and
there's
nothing
controversial
about
this
point.
if
congress
had
said
expressly
in
title
vii
that
federal
employees
could
not
obtain
interest
under
that
statute,
it
is
quite
clear
that
nothing
in
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
could
change
that
outcome.
but
that
is
essentially
this
case.
the
court
has
already
held
in
shaw
that
title
vii
does
not
authorize
awards
of
interest
to
federal
employees.
therefore...
it
did
that
of
course
not
by
expressly
withholding
interest,
but
by
omitting
any
mention
of
interest
from
the
statute...
that
means
that
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
interest,
simply
because
his
cause
of
action
does
not
provide
interest
as
part
of
the
relief.
now,
ms.
van
amburg's
response
to
that
point
this
morning
has
been
to
suggest
that
the
federal
sector
provisions
of
title
vii
have
a
split
personality.
that
those
same
provisions
should
be
interpreted
to
withhold
interest
from
other
federal
employees,
while
granting
interest
to
employees
of
the
postal
service.
and
her
rationale
for
that
assertion
is
the
suggestion
that
congress
viewed
the
postal
service
as
being
just
like
a
private
commercial
corporation
and
that
it
therefore
must
have
wanted
postal
employees
to
be
treated
just
like
private
sector
workers
under
title
vii.
now,
we
think
there
are
several
fundamental
problems
with
that
approach.
first,
it
oversimplifies
the
nature
of
what
is
a
very
complicated
federal
agency.
it
is
certainly
true
that,
as
petitioner
effectively
lays
out
in
its
brief,
that
there
are
many
ways
in
which
the
postal
service
is
like
a
private
corporation.
but
it
is
equally
true,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
in
an
enormously
long
footnote
on
pages
19
and
20,
it
is
equally
true
that
there
are
a
great
many
ways
in
which
the
postal
service
is
nothing
like
a
private
corporation.
among
many
other
things,
the
postal
service
exercises
power
of
eminent
domain,
and
enters
into
international
agreements,
and
investigates
criminal
violations.
obviously
it's
represented
by
the
solicitor
general
when
it
appears
in
this
court.
and
in
a
variety
of
other
ways,
the
postal
service
is
just
like
all
other
federal
agencies.
now,
the
second
more
fundamental
problem
with
petitioner's
suggestion
that
the
postal
service
is
very
much
like
a
private
corporation
is
that
we
think
it
is
beside
the
point
here.
we
think
that
petitioner's
list
of
postal
service
characteristics
and
our
competing
list
are
essentially
irrelevant.
it
would
not
be
a
sensible
approach
for
the
court
to
add
up
the
number
of
statutes
cited
by
each
brief
and
decide
on
the
basis
of
who
has
the
longer
list
that
for
all
time
and
all
purposes,
the
postal
service
is
more
like
a
private
corporation
or
is
more
like
a
government
agency.
the
question
here
is
a
much
narrower
one.
it
concerns
how
congress
wanted
postal
employees
to
resolve
their
complaints
of
employment
discrimination.
on
that
we
think
the
answer
is
quite
clear;
postal
employees
are
federal
employees.
they
are
in
the
postal
service
which
is
expressly
made
by
statute,
a
part
of
the
civil
service.
in
particular,
and
of
dispositive
importance
here,
congress
has
always
treated
postal
service
employees
identically
to
all
other
federal
employees
for
purposes
of
equal
employment
opportunity.
in
1970,
congress
specifically
considered
protecting
postal
service
employees
by
the
private
sector
provisions
of
title
vii.
it
decided
not
to.
it
decided
to
extend
the
existing
federal
sector
antidiscrimination
provisions.
in
1972
of
course
congress
placed
the
postal
service
in
the
federal
sector
and
not
in
the
private
sector
provisions
of
title
vii.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
for
purposes
of
equal
employment
opportunity
they
are
treated
identically
to
federal
employees.
as
i
suggested,--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
they
clearly
are
federal
employees.
they
were--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
labor
relations
section
of
the
postal
service
is
modeled
to
a
certain
extent
on
the
private
sector,
and
therefore
their
pay
is
not
awarded
under
the
same
standards
as
that
used
for
other
federal
employees.
but
as
i
say,
congress
was
quite
clear
that
they
were
federal
employees.
they
were
characterized
repeatedly
as
federal
employees
in
the
congressional
debates
and
particularly
for
purposes
of
equal
employment
opportunity,
as
well
as
for
many
other
public
rights
and
obligations
of
federal
employees.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
as
far
as
i'm
aware--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
to
the
extent
that
that
was
being
done
to
redress
employment
discrimination
claims
which
are
cognizable
now
under
title
vii,
i
think
that
would
be
appropriate
because--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
it
would
be
prohibited
if
it
was
something
which
is
cognizable
under
title
vii,
because
the
postal
service
clearly
cannot
by
its
own
action
waive
sovereign
immunity
when
congress
has
declined
to
do
so,
and
congress
has
declined
to
do
so.
as
i
suggested,
congress
has
treated
postal
employees
identically
to
other
federal
employees
for
purposes
of
equal
employment
opportunity.
and
postal
employees
must
bring
their
claims
of
employment
discrimination
under
the
federal
sector
provisions
of
title
vii.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
there
are
a
long
list
of
ways
in
the
postal
reorganization
act
and
in
title
v
which
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
in
which
they
are
treated
identically
to
other
federal
employees.
the
civil
service
reform
act
of
1978,
which
was
the
basic
charter
of
rights
of
federal
employees,
applies
to
most
to
postal
employees
who
are
veterans
preferences,
and
applies
to
other
federal
postal
employees
except
to
the
extent
that
it's
displaced
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
are
also
as
i
say
a
wide
variety
of
independent
provisions
of
personnel
laws
that
apply
to
postal
employees.
and
in
particular,
in
the
title
vii
contracts,
the
differences
between
postal
service
employees
and
federal
employees
on
the
one
hand,
and
private
sector
employees
on
the
other,
will
remain
whether
or
not
the
postal
service
is
viewed
as
being
like
a
private
corporation,
and
whether
or
not
the
rights
of
postal
employees
are
otherwise
viewed
as
being
similar
to
the
rights
of
private
as
opposed
to
public
sector
employees.
and
there's
no
answer
to
this,
we
think,
to
suggest
as
petitioner
does,
that
congress'
inclusion
of
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
in
the
postal
charter
can
somehow
change
that
and
signal
a
congressional
intention
that
postal
employees
should
be
treated
identically
to
private
sector
workers
under
title
vii.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
the
court
had
two
things
in
mind,
justice
o'connor.
first,
it
clearly
had
in
mind
the
long
line
of
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
which
a
cause
of
action
is
brought
pursuant
to
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
in
a
setting
in
which
the
relationship
between
the
agency
being
sued,
and
the
person
bringing
the
suit
is
the
same
as
one
in
the
private
sector.
that
was
the
case,
for
example,
in
the
franchise
tax
board
case
where
the
postal
service's
relationship
to
the
franchise
tax
board
was
the
same
as
that
of
any
other
employer.
i
think
the
best
example
of
what
the
court
had
in
mind
is
the
illustration
provided
in
footnote
5,
a
case
called
standard
oil
company
v.
united
states,
in
which
the
federal
government
had
essentially
gone
into
the
insurance
business,
into
the
rural
risk
insurance
business
in
competition
with
private
insurers
using
contracts
identical
to
those
used
by
private
insurers.
and
the
court
said
in
that
case,
the
relationship
between
an
insured
party
and
the
government
was
identical
to
the
relationship
between
an
insured
party
and
a
private
insurer,
and
therefore
the
terms
of
the
lawsuit
should
be
the
same.
now,
that
is
clearly
not
true
in
the
case
of
a
title
vii
suit
which
as
been
brought
against
the
postal
service.
it
must
be
brought
pursuant
to
the
federal
sector
provisions
of
title
vii,
which
differ
in
a
variety
of
significant
ways
from
the
private
sector
provisions
of
title
vii.
federal
employees,
including
postal
workers,
for
example,
must
use
the
administrative
mechanism
set
out
in
the
federal
sector
provision.
federal
employees
including
postal
workers,
unlike
private
sector
workers,
must
use
title
vii
exclusively
as
their
remedy
for
employment
discrimination.
those
differences
will
remain
however
the
nature
of
the
postal
service
is
characterized.
and
as
i
suggested,
the
existence
of
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
can't
change
that.
it
can't
magically
move
the
postal
service
from
one
provision
of
title
vii,
the
federal
sector
provision,
to
another
provision,
the
private
sector
provision.
that
means
that
postal
employees
must
bring
their
employment
discrimination
claims
pursuant
to
the
federal
sector
provision,
using
federal
sector
administrative
remedies
against
the
federal
defendant
like
other
federal
employees,
but
unlike
workers
in
the
private
sector.
they
must
use
title
vii
exclusively
as
their
remedy
for
employment
discrimination.
now,
we
think
the
clearest
indication
of
how
congress
wanted
to
treat
postal
employees
under
title
vii
is
how
it
actually
did
treat
them.
it
treated
them
identically
to
all
other
federal
workers.
those
federal
workers
cannot
get
interest
under
title
vii.
now,
by
giving
petitioner
the
special
benefit
of
interest,
it
will
introduce
an
incoherence
into
the
statutory
scheme
which
is
now
nicely
symmetrical
dividing
private
sector
and
federal
sector
workers.
it
would
also
give
employees
in
the
postal
service
a
special
benefit
and
distinction
which
is
not
awarded
to
any
other
federal
sector
employee,
any
other
employee
of
the
executive
branch.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
properly
declined
to
give
this
special
and
unique
benefit
to
postal
service
employees,
and
we
think
that
this
court
should
affirm
that
decision.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
this
case
would
apply
essentially
to
any
component
of
the
federal
government
which
is
sued
pursuant
to
section
717(c).
we
think
that
that
is
(a)
the
dispositive
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
(b)
clearly
embodies
the
congressional
intention
that
all
employees
of
the
federal
government
should
be
treated
in
one
way
for
purposes
of
employment
discrimination.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i'm
actually
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that
would
be
a
difficult
question
of
interpretation
for
the
court,
because
the
way
in
which
the
private
sector
provision
of
title
vii
is
written,
it
specifically
excludes,
as
i
said
from
the
definition
of
employer,--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--all,
not
only
the
united
states,
itself,
but
all
federally-owned
corporations
and
instrumentalities,
and
therefore,
it
is
quite
clear
that
an
employee
of
the
federal
government
cannot
bring
a
title
vii
action
pursuant
to
the
private
sector
provision.
