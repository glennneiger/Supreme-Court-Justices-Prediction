justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
first
case,
loeffler
against
frank,
comes
to
us
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
loeffler,
was
discharged
from
his
position
with
the
united
states
postal
service
and
he
contended
that
his
discharge
resulted
from
sex
discrimination
and
he
sued
the
postmaster
general
in
federal
court
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act.
the
court
found
in
his
favor
and
ordered
his
reinstatement,
but
it
refused
to
award
him
prejudgment
interest.
the
court
of
appeals,
sitting
en
banc,
was
divided
in
its
vote
but
it
affirmed
the
denial
of
prejudgment
interest.
it
concluded
that
congress
had
not
waived
the
postal
service's
sovereign
immunity
in
this
respect
in
a
title
vii
suit
even
though
under
the
postal
reorganization
act,
there
is
a
specific
provision
that
the
postal
service
may
sue
and
be
sued.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
hold
that
prejudgment
interest
may
be
awarded
in
a
suit
against
the
postal
service
under
title
vii.
congress
launched
the
service
into
the
commercial
world
and
thereby
removed
its
cloak
of
sovereignty
and
given
it
the
status
of
a
private
commercial
enterprise.
the
clause
must
be
liberally
construed
and
the
service's
liability
must
presume
to
be
the
same
as
that
of
any
other
business.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
has
joined
therein
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
o'connor.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part.
