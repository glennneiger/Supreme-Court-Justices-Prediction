justice
o'connor
well,
ms.
van
amburg,
i
suppose
at
bottom,
we're
dealing
with
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
the
extent
to
which
it's
been
waived.
and
i
suppose
you
can
take
the
position
that
when
congress
enacted
section
717
in
title
vii,
that
it
was
adopting
a
more
limited
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
that
that
more
limited
waiver
should
be
read
as
limiting
the
more
general
waiver
enacted
in
the
sue
and
be-sued
clause
for
the
postal
service.
justice
o'connor
what
do
you
suppose
the
court
had
in
mind
in
its
footnote
5?
are
there
some
agencies
that
would
fall
under
that?
