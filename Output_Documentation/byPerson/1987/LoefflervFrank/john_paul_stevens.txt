justice
stevens
i
think
their
argument
follows
from
title
vii
in
shaw.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
different
question.
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
for
this
entity
was
enacted
in
1970,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
and
the
title
vii
amendment
was
1972.
justice
stevens
now,
in
1971
say
this
lawsuit
had
been
brought,
could
your
client
have
recovered
from
the
postal
service,
and
i
guess
the
answer
is,
no.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
and
is
the
reason
that
you
had
no
right,
did
that
have
anything
to
do
with
sovereign
immunity?
justice
stevens
your
position
is
the
only
relevant
sovereign
immunity
was
waived
in
1970?
justice
stevens
and
what
happened
in
'72
was
you
got
a
cause
of
action
you
didn't
previously
have.
justice
stevens
why
couldn't
they
have
been
sued
as
a
private
enterprise
under
title
vii
in
1971?
justice
stevens
was
there
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
by
an
employee
who
was
discriminated
against
by
the
postal
service
in
1971?
justice
stevens
against
the
federal
government?
justice
stevens
well,
i
mean
the
postal
service
as
stated,
i
mean,
how
would
you
sue
the
postal
service
under
1981?
justice
stevens
what's
your
position
on
whether
they
were
suable
in
1971?
i'm
really
not
quite
clear.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
you
say
the
executive
order
created
a
duty
not
to
discriminate
and
a
violation
of
that
duty,
since
the
sovereign
immunity
had
been
waived,
gave
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
in
1971.
justice
stevens
all
that
title
vii
did
was
change
the
procedure
a
little
bit
and
make
it
a
statutory
duty
instead
of
an
administrative
duty?
justice
stevens
i
really
am
puzzled
because
if
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
enacted
in
1970
was
a
general
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
for
any
claims
for
which
there
was
a
cause
of
action
and
a
remedy,
why
wasn't,
to
the
extent
that
sovereign
immunity
would
otherwise
bar
the
recovery
of
interest,
why
hadn't
that
been
waived?
there
just
simply,
there
was
no
cause
of
action,
but
you
don't
really
contend
that
in
'72,
they
cut
back
on
the
waiver?
justice
stevens
you're
saying
that
all
they
did
in
'72
was
create
a
cause
of
action
which
hadn't
been
created.
justice
stevens
at
least
that's
one...
isn't
that
an
argument,
at
least?
justice
stevens
well,
she
waivers
a
little
on
it,
but
i
guess
that's
her
argument.
justice
stevens
but
can't
you
describe
that
in
either
of
two
ways:
one,
as
you
do
now,
they
were
preserving
a
portion
of
sovereign
immunity;
or
simply
say,
they
just
didn't
create
the
cause
of
action?
justice
stevens
supposing
you
had
a
statute
passed
today
that
created
a
cause
of
action
against
the
postal
service
for
late
delivery
of
mail?
say
there's
an
implied
promise
that
the
mail
be
delivered
within
a
week,
and
if
it's
over
30
days
late,
well,
you
get
a
dollar
a
day
or
something.
could
you
get
interest
on
that?
justice
stevens
brand
new
cause
of
action,
you
just
waived
sovereign
immunity
as
to
late
delivery
of
mail.
justice
stevens
mr.
rothfeld,
who
pays
the
judgment
if
your
client
loses?
justice
stevens
it
does
come
out
of
the
treasury,
not
out
of
the
postal
service?
justice
stevens
if
it
were
a
non-discrimination
suit
that
arose
in
1971
for
something
that
you
could
sue
the
post
office
for
then,
maybe
rent,
would
it
come
out
of
the
same
source?
justice
stevens
it
would.
so
it's
money
basically
allocated
to
this
particular
entity,
and
obviously
the
postmaster
general
doesn't
pay
it
individually?
justice
stevens
and
neither
does
the
united
states
generally?
justice
stevens
yes,
in
the
same
sense
that
a
rent
payment
might,
or
a
suit
for
rent
might?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
following
up
on
justice
marshall's
thought,
do
you
suppose
it
would
be
permissible
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
for
their
collective
bargaining
agent
to
negotiate
an
agreement
which
authorized
the
award
of
prejudgment
interest
in
all
litigation
against
their
employer?
justice
stevens
or
would
they
say
they
couldn't
do
it
because
sovereign
immunity
would
preclude
it?
justice
stevens
well,
the
question
wasn't
whether
it
was
inappropriate,
the
question
was
would
there
be
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
would
it
be
prohibited.
i
think
that's
your
position.
justice
stevens
for
most
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
they're
treated
differently
from
federal
employees?
justice
stevens
they
do
have
collective
bargaining
rights
that
are
different.
justice
stevens
i
have
a
question.
maybe
it's
too
far
off
in
left
field,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
sue
and
be
sued
agencies
and
a
lot
of
them
are
not
mentioned
in
section
717.
i
guess
federal
housing
agency,
aren't
there?
am
i
not
right,
there
are
quite
a
few
of
these
agencies?
justice
stevens
what
requires
them,
if
anything,
to
obey
non-discrimination
laws,
most
of
those?
i'm
just
wondering
if
whatever
we
decide
in
this
case
would
apply
to
a
lot
of
other
agencies,
or
is
it
really
pretty
unique
to
the
postal
service?
justice
stevens
but
does
this
statutory
provision
apply
to
all
these
other
sue
and
be
sued
agencies
in
much
the
same
way?
justice
stevens
i
don't
think...
it
doesn't
seem
to
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
i
was
just
puzzled
by
it
as
i
was
just
looking
at
it.
justice
stevens
all
federal
agencies.
