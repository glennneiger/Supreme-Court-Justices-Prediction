justice
white
well,
if
this
weren't
a
title
vii
case,
don't
you
think
that
the
government
would
agree
with
you,
with
everything
you've
said
so
far?
justice
white
what
about
the
postal
service,
would
they
agree
with
you
in
the
postal
service
if
this
were
an
ordinary
lawsuit,
rather
than
a
title
vii
case?
justice
white
well,
if
this
weren't
a
title
vii
suit,
say
it
was
a
contract
action
against
the
postal
service.
justice
white
so
your
submission
is
that
the
title
vii
717
really
took
away
that
waiver
to
some
extent?
justice
white
so
you
should
look
at
this
717
just
as
a
waive
with
respect
to
title
vii
suits?
