ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
over
75
years
since
this
court's
decision
in
national
home
v.
parrish,
it's
been
the
general
rule
that
an
agency
authorized
by
congress
to
sue
and
be
sued
is
liable
for
prejudgment
interest
in
the
same
way
and
under
the
same
circumstances
as
a
private
enterprise
would
be.
the
government
today
seeks
an
exception
to
this
general
rule
to
deny
interest
to
employees
of
sue
and
be-sued
agencies
who
have
been
the
victims
of
employment
discrimination.
we
believe
that
the
issue
in
this
case,
that
is,
whether
or
not
an
employee
may
recover
prejudgment
interest
in
a
title
vii
case
against
the
postal
service
is
flatly
resolved
by
the
application
of
a
longstanding
principle
governing
resolution
of
claims
against
sue
and
be-sued
agencies.
and
that
principle
is
one
first
articulated
by
this
court
in
a
1940
case,
fha
v.
burr
known
as
the
"liberal
construction
rule".
and
that
rule
is
that
a
sue
and
be-sued
clause
in
the
charter
of
a
federal
agency
effects
a
broad
waiver
of
immunity
and
subjects
that
agency
to
suit
and
the
natural
incidence
of
suit
which
a
private
enterprise
would
be
liable
for
in
the
same
circumstances.
that
rule
was
more
recently
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
a
suit
against
the
postal
service,
the
franchise
tax
board
case
in
1984
interpreting
the
scope
of
the
waiver
of
immunity
in
the
charter
of
the
postal
service.
the
no-interest
rule,
which
is
another
longstanding
rule
which
is
to
the
effect
that
interest
cannot
be
recovered
against
the
government
absent
an
express
statutory
waiver,
is
not
applicable
to
the
postal
service.
this
court,
in
another
title
vii
case
the
last
term,
library
of
congress
v.
shaw,
noted
that
the
no-interest
rule
doesn't
apply
to
agencies
which
have
assumed
the
status
of
a
private
commercial
enterprise.
and
typically
congress
has
waived
the
immunity
of
the
agency
by
inserting
into
its
charter,
a
sue
and
be-sued
clause.
we
believe
that
the
postal
service
is
one
such
agency
noted
by
this
court
in
footnote
5
of
the
shaw
opinion.
the
no-interest
rule
doesn't
apply
to
it
because
it
does
not
have
the
status
of
a
sovereign
for
these
purposes.
the
government's
position
is
that
there
is
not
one
agency
which
fits
within
the
footnote
5
exception
of
the
shaw
decision
to
the
no-interest
rule.
we
don't
believe
that
footnote
5
is
superfluous;
we
think
it's
a
reflection
of
this
court's
understanding
of
the
75-year-old
rule
that
interest
is
recoverable
against
a
sue
and
be-sued
agency.
is
the
postal
service
a
footnote
5
agency?
clearly,
the
franchise
tax
board
case
answers
that
question
squarely.
it
is
such
an
agency.
congress
intended
the
postal
service,
when
it
chartered
it
in
the
1970
postal
reorganization
act,
to
operate
as
much
like
a
private
business
as
possible.
in
franchise
tax
board,
this
court
stated
that
because
of
the
charter
of
the
postal
reorganization
act,
because
of
the
legislative
history,
we
must
assume
that
the
postal
service's
liability
is
the
same
as
a
private
business.
and
we
must
also
assume
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
preserve
sovereign
immunity
for
the
postal
service.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
i
don't
know
if
they'd
admit
it,
that
interest
is
recoverable
against
a
sue
and
be-sued
agency,
but
i
would
think
they'd
have
to.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
i
would
hope
they
would
because
there's
so
many
consistent
court
decisions
to
the
effect
that
interest
is
recoverable
against
a
sue
and
be-sued
agency.
those
decisions
have
followed
in
the
breach
of
contract
actions,
other
back
pay
actions.
their
position
is
based
upon
an
inference,
justice
white,
that
under
section
717,
congress
intended
to
impose
equal
liability
upon
all
federal
agencies
regardless
of
whether
it's
a
sue
and
be-sued
agency.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
that's
right.
but
they
don't
acknowledge
that
the
postal
service
is
a
footnote
5
agency
where
the
no-interest
rule
doesn't
apply.
because
all
section
717
does
is
lays
out
a
statutory
scheme
for
processing
charges
for
federal
employees.
but
once
that
employee
gets
to
the
federal
courtroom,
the
remedies
are
the
same.
the
only
thing
that
prevents
an
employee
of
the
federal
government
from
getting
interest
is
the
no-interest
rule.
and
that
rule
simply
doesn't
apply
to
the
postal
service.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
that's
correct.
that's
what
the
postal
service's
position
is.
however,
congress
is
experienced
in
legislating
against
the
backdrop
of
liberal
construction
rule,
and
congress
knows
how
to
express
in
a
statute
what
it
wants
to
do
if
it
wants
to
delimit
the
general
waiver
of
a
sue
and
be
sued
agency.
it
did
that
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
back
in
1945.
section
2679
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
explicitly
states
that
the
authority
of
any
federal
agency
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
its
own
name
shall
not
be
construed
to
authorize
suits
against
such
agency
on
claims
cognizable
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
and
the
remedies
provided
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act
shall
be
the
exclusive
remedies.
so
here
congress
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
acknowledges
that
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
in
the
charter
of
a
federal
agency
can
be
a
separate
source
of
authority
for
proceeding
under
suit
or
for
certain
remedies.
and
congress
did
not
do
that
in
title
vii.
not
that
it
wouldn't
have
known
how
to,
but
it
simply
is
silent
in
title
vii
about
how
to
treat
sue
and
be
sued
agencies.
so
i
think
that
we
have
to
defer
to
congress'
experience
in
legislating
against
this
long-standing
liberal
construction
rule
which
tells
us
that
it's
up
to
congress
to
draw
the
line
on
these
delimitations
of
a
general
waiver
effected
by
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause.
it
shouldn't
be
the
court's
inferring
any
delimitations
absent
plain
evidence
of
congress'
intent
to
delimit
the
general
waiver,
or
absent
a
grave
interference
with
a
governmental
function,
which
i
don't
think
we
have
in
this
case.
there's
certainly
no
policy
reason
for
drawing
the
line
on
interest
here.
this
court's
recognized
in
general
motors
v.
devex
that
interest
can
be
a
catalyst
to
avoiding
prolonged
litigation.
the
postal
service
is
one
of
the
most
frequently
sued
employers
under
title
vii.
making
them
liable
for
prejudgment
interest
might
further
earlier
settlement
of
meritorious
claims.
i
might
note
that
this
case
was
appealed
on
the
merits
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
on
issues
of
credibility
findings
of
the
trial
judge.
if
federal
express
takes
interest
into
consideration
as
to
whether
to
settle
a
claim,
why
shouldn't
the
postal
service.
i
think
that
congress
intended
the
postal
service
to
bring
its
management
decisionmaking
as
nearly
as
possible
up
to
the
level
of
private
enterprise.
and
so
there
really
is
no
policy
reason
to
draw
the
line
by
inference
here.
and
justice
o'connor's
point
about
section
717
is
correct;
that's
the
government's
argument.
the
government
wants
the
court
to
infer
a
delimitation
on
the
general
waiver
from
the
language
of
section
717,
but
all
that
that
language
does
is
tell
us
how
to
process
the
charges
for
the
employee.
once
that
employee
gets
into
the
federal
courtroom,
that
employee's
entitled
to
the
same
remedies
as
a
private
employee
would
be.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
well,
that
is
a
procedural
distinction,
and--
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
--it
does.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
more
by
what
it
doesn't
say
than
what
it
does
say.
i
think
its
silence
on
the
issue
of
whether
interest
is
recoverable
is
not
particularly
instructive,
because
as
this
court
noted
in
the
shaw
case,
interest
is
an
element
of
damages
that's
historically
been
viewed
as
separate
from
damages
on
a
separate
claim.
but
its
silence
on
the
exclusiveness
of
the
damages
or
the
remedy
for
sue
and
be
sued
agencies
is
more
instructive,
given
what
congress
had
done
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
so
if
we
are
to
conclude
that
the
no-interest
rule
applies
to
the
postal
service,
we
would
be
doing
so
undermining
this
liberal
construction
rule
which
has
been
in
place
for
48
years
now.
the
fact
that
it's
in
different
names
is,
i
think,
an
irrelevant
procedural
distinction.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
1972.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
in
1971,
if
we
had
brought
an
action
under
title
vii?
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
i
would
have
to
say
the
answer
is,
no,
because
we
didn't
have
a
right
to
proceed
under
title
vii
at
that
time.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
no.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
that's
right.
it
added
a
cause
of
action
against
the
federal
agencies
that
did
not
previously
exist.
but
the
postal
service
comes
into
the
1972
law
as
a
private
enterprise,
with
the
status
of
a
private
enterprise
for
the
purposes
of
interest
and
damages.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
well,
because
of
what
we
know
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
postal
reorganization
act,
congress
expressly
listed
those
federal
labor
laws
applicable
to
the
postal
service
in
its
charter
and
left
out
title
vii.
and
there
was
some
debate
about
it.
the
debate
was
not
over
sovereign
immunity;
it
was
a
debate
whether
to
leave
the
employees
of
the
postal
service
under
the
executive
order
or
to
put
them
under
title
vii.
which
shows,
i
think,
that
congress
is
viewing
title
vii
as
a
different
kind
of
agency,
the
fact
that
they
even
talked
about
putting
them
under
title
vii.
but
the
issue
was
where
would
the
employees
be
better
off,
under
the
executive
order
or
under
title
vii,
and
that
was
the
debate.
but
they
later
changed
their
mind
about
where
they'd
be
better
off.
the
issue
of
sue
and
be
sued
in
the
official
name
versus
the
name
of
the
postmaster's
the
exact
kind
of
issue
that
was
raised
in
fha
v.
burr,
and
dismissed
by
the
court.
courts
have
been
reluctant
to
draw
procedural
distinctions
that
would
sabotage
this
rule
construing
sue
and
be
sued
clauses
broadly.
i
think
that
this
court
rejected
a
similar
procedural
distinction
in
the
franchise
tax
board
case
when
you
said
we're
really
not
going
to
say
that
a
suit
in
an
administrative
proceeding
is
not
covered
under
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
versus
a
suit
in
the
courtroom.
that's
the
kind
of
procedural
distinction
the
courts
have
rejected.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
if
i
did.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
the
right
of
proceeding
into
the
courtroom.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
there
was
a
cause
of
action
for
employment
discrimination
back
then.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
it's
certainly
debatable,
however,
under
title
vii
whether
an
employee
could
have
gotten
back
pay.
an
employee
could
have
complained
through
the
executive
order
administrative
process
back
then.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
possibly
under
1981,
possibly
under
42
u.s.c.
1981
there
might
have
been.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
against
the
postal
service.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
well,
in
the
same
way
you
would
sue
a
private
enterprise
if
you
assume
that
the
postal
service
occupies
the
status
of
a
private
commercial
enterprise,
which
has
not
really
been
decided
by
this
court.
but
in
that
two
years,
i
don't
think
we
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
well,
there
were
some
cases
that
went
into
the
court
of
claims
under
the
executive
order
for
back
pay,
and
i
would
say
that
they
were
suable
back
then,
at
least
in
the
court
of
claims.
although
this
court
has,
in
brown
v.
gsa
settled
that
in
terms
of
forums,
that
title
vii
would
be
the
exclusive
remedy.
so,
yes,
i
think
they
were
suable
back
in
1971,--
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
--that's
right.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
that's
correct,
that's
our
position.
and
really
all
title
vii
is
is
an
exclusive
administrative
scheme
for
getting
into
the
federal
courtroom,
but
once
the
employee's
there,
the
damages
are
the
same
against
a
sue
and
be
sued
agency.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
lisa
s.
van
amburg
thank
you.
mr.
rothfeld
suggests
that
this
court
must
make
a
decision
between
the
two
waivers,
the
waiver
in
the
postal
service
charter,
or
title
vii,
which
one
applies.
i
don't
agree
that
the
two
are
mutually
exclusive.
i
think
that
the
court
can
take
into
consideration
and
give
effect
to
each
waiver.
the
waiver
that
occurs
in
the
postal
reorganization
act
is
a
waiver
of
the
status
of
the
agency
as
the
sovereign.
the
waiver
that
occurs
in
title
vii
concerns
a
substantive
right
to
proceed.
both
can
be
taken
into
consideration.
title
vii
doesn't
tell
us
anything,
however,
regarding
interplay
of
these
two
waivers.
congress
has
expressed
interplay
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
but
has
not
done
so
in
title
vii.
so
then
we
are
left
to
infer
a
wavy
line
as
to
what
the
postal
service
is
immune
to
and
what
it
isn't
by
mr.
rothfeld's
argument.
under
the
longstanding
liberal
construction
rule,
no
inferences
to
that
broad
waiver
of
the
postal
reorganization
act
should
be
lightly
drawn.
and
it's
clearly
a
rule
that's
very
functional
for
the
courts
in
the
sense
that
if
you
assume
that
congress
is
experienced
in
legislating
against
this
liberal
construction
rule,
they
you
really
don't
have
to
draw
wavy
lines.
maybe
they're
liable
for
punitive
damages,
maybe
they're
liable
for
costs,
for
interest.
that's
up
to
congress
to
draw
the
line.
congress
knows
how
to
do
it,
it's
done
it
before.
it's
expressed
it
before.
and
congress
understands
that
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
can
be
a
separate
source
of
authority
for
proceeding
even
as
to
certain
damages,
elements
of
damages
which
interest
theoretically
is
an
element
of
damages.
so
the
government's
position
is
based
upon
a
mere
inference,
not
upon
any
express
statutory
language.
and
the
fact
that
interest
is
not
articulated
in
title
vii
isn't
particularly
instructive.
it
doesn't
mean
that
congress
did
not
want
sue
and
be
sued
employees
to
get
interest.
it's
a
function
of
the
fact
that
interest
has
historically
been
viewed
as
an
element
of
damages
separate
and
apart
from
the
substantive
claim.
so
a
as
a
natural
incident
of
title
vii
suits,
interest
should
be
recoverable
against
the
postal
service
because
it
occupies
the
status
of
a
private
commercial
enterprise
for
these
purposes.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
needs
to
make
a
broad
decision
that
would
affect
over
124
sue
and
be
sued
agencies
because
of
the
unique
character
of
the
postal
service.
it's
clearly
one
of
those
agencies
the
court
had
in
mind
in
footnote
5
of
the
shaw
opinion.
congress
when
it
created
it,
removed
the
cloak
of
sovereign
immunity
and
launched
it
into
the
world
of
private
commercial
enterprise.
there
are
a
lot
of
sue
and
be
sued
agencies.
the
first
interest
case
was
against
the
national
home
for
disabled
volunteer
soldiers
which
i
don't
think
was
a
commercial
enterprise.
but
this
court
need
not
define
the
holding
so
broadly
because
of
the
unique
character
of
the
postal
service.
i
would
like
to
just
for
one
moment
note
something
i
found
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
postal
reorganization
act,
which
i
think
is
an
indication
of
congress'
understanding
that
there
would
be
new
causes
of
action
created
in
the
future
which
would
affect
the
postal
service
in
the
same
way
as
a
private
enterprise
would
be
affected.
in
discussing
the
applicability
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
the
postal
service,
which
is
correct,
the
national
labor
relations
act
applies
to
the
postal
service
except
for
the
right
to
strike.
congress
discussed
the
applicability
of
right
to
work
laws
of
the
various
states
and
recognized
that
these
laws
applied
to
the
postal
service
in
the
same
way
as
they
would
a
private
enterprise.
and
then
it
said,
in
the
legislative
history,
if
the
national
labor
relations
act
should
be
further
amended
at
some
future
time,--

if
the
national
labor
relations
act
should
be
further
amended
at
some
future
time
either
to
extend
or
to
restrict
right
to
work
provisions,
that
amendment
presumably
would
apply
to
the
postal
service
in
the
same
way
that
it
applies
to
other
federal
entities.
i
think
congress
understood
that
there
would
be
changes
in
the
future
and
the
postal
service
would
be
affected
by
these
changes
in
the
same
way
as
a
private
business
would
be.
and
that's
the
key
there,
that
the
postal
service
came
into
title
vii
effectively
as
a
private
business.
thank
you.
