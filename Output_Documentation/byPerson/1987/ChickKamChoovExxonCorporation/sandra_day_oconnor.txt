justice
o'connor
mr.
cooney,
to
repeat,
you
say
that
you
argued
to
the
district
court
that
federal
forum
non
conveniens
determinations
pre-empted
state
forum
non
conveniens
determinations?
justice
o'connor
you
didn't
argue
that;
you
just
argued
a
traditional
forum
non
conveniens
argument?
justice
o'connor
so
the
pre-emption
issue
really
hasn't
been
litigated?
justice
o'connor
but
there
is
a
new
federal
statute
affecting
it,
isn't
there?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
talked
about
a
new
federal
statute?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
doesn't
apply
to
this
one.
it
was
enacted
later.
