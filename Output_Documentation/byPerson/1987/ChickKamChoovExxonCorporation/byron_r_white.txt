justice
white
i
suppose
you
are
saying
that,
if
there
is
an
estoppel,
that
claim
should
be
first
made
in
the
state
court?
justice
white
--wouldn't
you
think,
if
the
issue
has
been
decided
in
the
federal...
if
singapore
law
applies,
certainly
texas
can't
apply
it's
wrongful
death
statute?
justice
white
all
right,
so
when
the
federal
claims
were
dismissed
in
the
state
court,
and
you
didn't
complain
about
that.
justice
white
so
that
just
leaves
the
texas
claim.
justice
white
well,
in
any
event,
the
defendants
in
the
texas
courts
could
claim
collateral
estoppel?
justice
white
would
they
win?
justice
white
all
right,
so
if
the
texas
courts
rejected
that
collateral
estoppel
claim,
it
would
come
on
up
through
the
state
courts
and
could
get
here?
justice
white
you
think
the
estoppel
claim
should
win
in
the
state
court,
if
it
was
made?
justice
white
why
didn't
you
object
to
the
dismissal
of
the
federal
claims?
justice
white
well,
i
know.
weren't
you...
was
that
dismissal
correct?
justice
white
if
the
federal
court
dismissed
them
because
there
wasn't
any...
couldn't
be
a
federal
claim
if
singapore
law
applied?
justice
white
it's
like
a
motion...
you
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
justice
white
and
you
don't
think
that
would
be...
you
think
you
can
retry
that
out
in
a
state
court?
justice
white
i
know,
but
how
about
the
federal
claims?
couldn't
the
federal
court
enjoin
the
retrial
or
attempted
retrial
of
the
federal
claims
in
the
state
court?
justice
white
just
like
they
would
be
on
the
state
claims?
justice
white
what
do
you
mean
by
"pre-emption"?
justice
white
so
you
think
that...
is
that
different
than
talking
about
estoppel?
collateral
estoppel,
or
res
judicata?
justice
white
but
i
thought
that
one
of
the
elements
in
forum
non
conveniens
adjudication
as
judge
gee
said,
is
what
law
applies?
justice
white
and
accordingly,
the
federal
court
certainly
held
that
united
states
law
didn't
apply.
that
singapore
laws
apply.
and
that
part
of
its
adjudication,
it
seems
to
me,
i
don't
know
why
that
is
not
conclusive
on
the
state
court?
justice
white
i
know,
but
i'm
talking
to
your
claim
that
forum
non
conveniens
just
isn't
one
of
those
doctrines
that
can
be
a
subject
to
pre-emption
or
preclusion
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
but
if
part
of
it
is
what
law
applies,
and
the
federal
court
is
deciding
what
law
applies,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
finding...
you
can't
relitigate
that.
justice
white
under
the
texas
wrongful
death
statute?
justice
white
i
know,
but
it
wouldn't
be...
your
texas
wrongful
death
claim
would
be
kaput.
it's
a
substantive
claim.
justice
white
so
you
would
try
to
make
a
wrongful
death
claim
under
foreign
law?
justice
white
it
would
win
on
the
foreign
law
claim
anyway
in
the
texas
court
no
matter
what.
justice
white
you
concede
that
the
state
law
claim
would
probably
couldn't
go
forward
if
the
federal
court
decision
was
pleaded
in
the
state
court?
justice
white
--you
would
say,
though,
even
if
that
issue
of
the
applicable
law
was
clearly
adjudicated,
you
would
say
that
no
injunction
could
issue;
that
you
would
have
to
plead
it
in
the
state
court.
justice
white
what
about
the
foreign
law
claim?
justice
white
i
know,
but
didn't
they
plead
a
claim
under
foreign
law
in
the
state
court?
justice
white
so
you
claim
the
foreign
law
claim
was
just
plead
as
a
part
of
the
texas
wrongful
death?
justice
white
it
didn't
claim
a
right
to
recover
under
singapore
law?
justice
white
let's
assume
it
appeared
in
the
complaint
as
a
separate
count,
as
a
claim
for
damages
of
some
sort
under
singapore
law.
that
could
have
gone
forward,
couldn't
it?
justice
white
and
it
was
not
foreclosed
by
the
federal--
justice
white
--so
it's
alive?
justice
white
i
thought
the
injunction
just
forbade
the
texas
court
going
ahead
at
all?
justice
white
--i
still
can't
get
through
my
mind
why
you
think
the
claim
stated
in
the
state
court
based
on
singapore
law
would
not
go
forward
in
that
court?
justice
white
no,
no.
with
it.
justice
white
why
is
it
binding
on
the
state
court?
justice
white
so
that's
a
pre-emption?
it's
really
a
pre-emption--
justice
white
--so
you're
saying
that
it's
just
a
reverse
erie?
yes,
sir.
it's
a
reverse-erie
question.
it's
a
reverse-erie
question,
so
it's
a
ruling
on
the
merits?
justice
white
and
it's
a
substantive
rule
under
maritime
law?
justice
white
judge
clark
thought
that
this
was
a
pre-emption
issue.
he
said,
"i
agree
with
judge
gee
that,
if
i
have
to
follow
his
course,
i
agree
with
him
that
maritime
law
pre-empts.
"
justice
white
i
would
think
so.
justice
white
and
to
rely
on
atlantic
coast
lines.
