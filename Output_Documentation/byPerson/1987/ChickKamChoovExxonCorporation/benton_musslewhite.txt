mr.
benton
musslewhite
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
try
to
articulate
what
i
think
is
the
crucial
issue
here,
and
that
is
where
simply
stated
a
federal
court
has
dismissed
a
case
on
grounds
of
forum
non
conveniens
and
the
plaintiffs
refiled
in
the
state
court;
whether
or
not
that
federal
court
can
then
enjoin
the
state
court
despite
the
provisions
of
the
anti-injunction
statute?
now
having
said
that,
i'd
like
to
go
into
a
little
detail
about
the
procedural
facts
involved
here,
because
i
think
they're
important.
and
particularly
important
for
what
was
not
decided
in
the
original
federal
court
action
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
atlantic
railway.
after
the
case
was
dismissed
on
grounds
of
forum
non
conveniens
by
the
initial
federal
court
and
suit
was
filed
in
the
state
court,
the
respondents
removed
to
the
federal
court;
the
federal
court,
though,
requested
to
do
so
by
the
petitioners,
to
remand
the
case;
and
refused
to
remand;
and
again
dismissed
the
case;
and
that
was
appealed;
and
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
that
decision
and
ordered
that
the
case
be
remanded.
once
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
state
court,
the
respondents
then
went
to
the
federal
court
in
a
new
suit
and
got
the
permanent
injunction,
which
is
the
basis
of
this
hearing
here.
now,
in
the
mean
time,
that
went
up
on
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit;
and
while
that
was
being
done,
there
was
another
case
proceeding
out
on
the
west
coast
in
the
ninth
circuit,
called
the
zipfel
case,
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case,
in
a
split
decision
held,
that
the
injunction
was
proper
under
the
relitigation
exception,
apparently...
that's
the
way
i
read
the
decision...
because
even
though
there
was
a
difference
between
the
texas
forum
non
conveniens
law
and
the
federal
forum
non
conveniens
law,
the
federal
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine
pre-empted
the
state
doctrine;
and
therefore,
there
was
the
basis
for
entering...
issuing,
the
injunction.
judge
reavley
dissented
and
held
that
on
the
basis
of
atlantic
coast
line
and
other
supreme
court
decisions
that
that
was
not
a
proper
decision,
and
those
matters
should
be
left
to
the
state
courts
to
decide;
and
that
the
injunction
was
not
proper.
his
dissent
agreed
almost
foursquare
with
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
zipfel
case
which
held
that
in
a
similar
situation...
also
a
maritime
case,
the
injunction
was
improper.
having
said
that,
i'd
like
to
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
to
point
out
what
was
not
decided
in
the
original
federal
court
action:
it
was
not
decided
that,
as
contended
by...
the
respondents
and
some
of
the
amici
briefs,
that
the
case
could
not
be
tried
anywhere
in
the
united
states;
nor
was
it
decided
that
it
had
to
be
tried
in
singapore.
what
was
simply
decided
was
that
federal
court
would
not
accept
a
case
on
grounds
of
forum
non
conveniens;
that
that
federal
court
did
not
feel
that
it
was
a
convenient
forum
for
the
case;
and
imposed
conditions
so
that,
if
the
plaintiffs
wanted
to,
they
could
go
to
singapore
and
have
the
case
adjudicated
there.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
it
was
decided
that
american
law
would
not
apply,
and
the
court's
discussion
of
that
indicated
that
it
felt
singapore
law
should
apply.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
there
was
a
contention
under
state
law,
the
state
wrongful
death
act.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
because--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--it
was
dismissed
under
forum
non
conveniens,
that
state
law.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
was
not
that
a
federal
maritime
law?
mr.
benton
musslewhite
just
federal.
there
was
no
decision
that
the
state...
they
dismissed
the
state
law
claims
on
the
grounds
of
forum
non
conveniens.
they
did
not
decide
that
state
law
could
not
apply.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
the
court
indicated
that
american
federal
maritime
law
did
not
apply,
and
in
so-doing
indicated
that
it
felt
like
the
foreign
law
would
apply.
that
was
the
decision,
but
it
did
not--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--that
is
the
essence
of
the
decision.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
well,
because
we're
getting
into
the
forum
non
conveniens
issue
as
it
relates
to
choice
of
law,
and
really
what
we
have
here
is
a
forum
non
conveniens
issue
and
not
choice
of
law.
certainly
the
foreign
law
claims
were
not
adjudicated.
that
is,
texas
has
a
statute,
justice
scalia,
which
allows
a
plaintiff
to
adjudicate
its
rights
under
foreign
laws.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
i
would
next
concede
that
defendants,
or
the
respondents
in
the
state
court
action
contend
that
that
was
collateral
estoppel
or
directly
estopped
by
the
determination
by
the
federal
court,
the
first
federal
court,
that
singapore
law
applied;
and
by
implicitly
rejecting
the
state
law
claim.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
no,
your
honor.
i
would
have
to
disagree
on
that.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
as
construed
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases,
beginning
with
atlantic
coast
line
to
vendo
co.
v.
lektro-vend,
and
as
recently
as
parsons
steel.
i
do
not
believe
that
under
that
doctrine
a
collateral
estoppel
or
direct
estoppel
issue
is
the
subject
of
an
injunction
of
a
relitigation
statute.
only
cases
as
fully
adjudicated
upon
the
merits,
as
a
revisors
notes
say,
can
be
the
basis
of
the
injunction
under
2283,
and
that's
what
is
the
bottom
line
here,
that
there
are
certain
collateral
estoppel
issues
that
can
probably
be
successfully
asserted
in
the
state
court
action,
which
is
where
this
belongs
now.
but
there
are
not
issues,
even
though
they
might
amount
to
direct
estoppel
or
collateral
estoppel,
which
could
be
the
basis
of
an
injunction
under
the
relitigation
section.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
that's
one
thing.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
that
would
be
true.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
the
federal
claims
were
dismissed;
that
was
appealed
but
we
lost.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
and
the
foreign
law
claims,
your
honor.
texas
has
a
statute
that
allows
the
plaintiffs
to
bring
the
foreign
law
claims
in
the
texas
courts
and
have
those
adjudicated.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
i
think
there
is
no
question
they
could
claim
it.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
i
would
have
to
say
that
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
the
federal
court,
if
the
federal
court
decision
is
that
clear...
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
that
clear,
justice
scalia...
there
is
no
question
there
is
intimations
in
that
federal
court
judgment
to
the
effect
that
they
believe
singapore
law
should
apply,
and
not
american.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
that's
right,
justice
white.
i
think
that
is--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--knowing
the
background
of
this
case
in
this
particular
case,
i
do
not
think
it
should
win
because
the
court
did
not
directly
address
that
issue,
even
though,
as
i
conceded
to
justice
scalia,
the
first
federal
court
did
not
say
"we're
now
going
to
decide
whether
texas'
wrongful
death
statute
will
apply
to
these
claims.
"
it
just
simply
said
federal
maritime
law
doesn't
apply,
and
the
reason
we
don't
think
federal
maritime
law
applies
is
because
it
appears
to
us
that
the
federal
law
should
apply.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
exactly,
your
honor.
in
your
decision,
in
your
opinion
in
vendo
v.
lectro-vend,
you
indicated
that
we
should
look
to
the
pre
toucey
cases
because
of
the
revisors
notes
refers
to
those
cases
when
the
1948
amendment
was
enacted.
and
in
looking
at
those
cases
and
i
read
every
one
of
them,
there's
not
a
single
case
that
did
not
involve
a
complete
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
read,
in
his
dissent
referred
to
the
complete
adjudications.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
well,
we
did.
we
lost,
your
honor.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
i
don't
agree
with
it,
but
it
based
the
law.
it's
the
law
of
the
case.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
that's
true
if
federal--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--that
could
be
construed,
under
romero.
romero
indicates
that
that's
the
way
you
construe
that,
when
you
find
that
federal
maritime
law
does
not
apply,
then
it
could
properly
be
a
dismissal
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
well,
the
reason
it
couldn't
be
a
complete...
they
didn't
solve
all
the
problems,
justice,
we
had
the
other
claims
there.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
your
honor,
i
submit
that
they
could
not.
i
think
that
they
would
be
successful,
justice
white,
going
into
the
state
court,
raising
the
collateral
estoppel
or
direct
estoppel,
as
to
the
federal
claims,
i
think
the
respondents
would
be
successful.
we
concede.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
well,
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
on
the
state
claim,
there
is
a
considerably
more
serious
question
there
i
concede
because
it
was
plead.
but
foreign
law
was
not
plead
in
the
original
federal
court
claim,
so
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
question
that
there
is
no
estoppel,
direct,
collateral,
or
any
other
kind
of
res
judicata
against
the
foreign
law
claims
being
prosecuted
in
the
state
court.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
it
was
a
decision
on
the
merits
with
regard
to
the
federal
law
claim.
they
held
that
the
jones
act...
that
the
plaintiff
was
not
a
seaman.
that's
a
decision
on
the
merits.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
because
it's
a
decision
on
the
grounds
of
forum
non
conveniens.
they
dismissed
the
state
law
claims
and
all
other
claims
other
than
the
federal
maritime
law
claims
on
the
forum
non
conveniens,
your
honor,
without
prejudice.
the
order
says
"without
prejudice".
so
it
cannot
be
a
decision
on
the
merits
as
i
see
it;
and
certainly
it's
not
the
basis
of
an
injunction
under
2283.
it
does
not
constitute
that
kind
of
an
order
that
can
be
subject
to
a
relitigation
exception
injunction.
at
any
event,
what
else
was
not
decided
in
the
case
below
was,
and
this
is
very
important
when
we
read
atlantic
coast
line,
that
the
pre-emption
question
was
not
raised
or
decided
in
the
federal
court
action.
moreover,
the
state
law
forum
non
conveniens
law,
that
is,
what
law
would
apply
and
what
is
a
state
law
and
how
it
would
apply
in
this
particular
case,
and
whether
or
not
the
case
would
be
appropriately
dismissed
on
the
grounds
of
forum
non
conveniens
under
state
law
was
not
raised
or
decided
in
the
federal
court
action,
the
first
original
federal
court
action.
so
that,
when
you
read
atlantic
coast
line,
the
bottom
line
to
all
of
it
is,
is
that
atlantic
coast
line,
as
i
respectfully
read
it,
says,
that
unless
issues
are
actually
raised,
cannot
form
the
basis
of
the
injunction
on
the
basis
of
the
relitigation
section.
so
these
issues,
not
having
been
raise,
as
occurred
in
atlantic
coast
line,
the
pre-emption
question
was
not
raised
there;
for
the
majority,
the
court
held
that
the
injunction
was
not
proper;
and
the
same
thing
would
apply
here.
and
i
think
atlantic
coast
line
in
that
regard
is
pretty
well
dispositive
of
that
issue.
even
if
pre-emption
could
be
the
basis,
and
i
say
that
even
if
a
pre-emption
had
been
raised,
i
don't
think
pre-emption
is
the
kind
of
thing
when
you
read
three
decisions,
that
would
be
vendo,
atlantic
coast
line,
and
amalgamated
clothing
works.
all
three
of
those
cases
speak
very
strongly
about,
and
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
his
opinion
in
vendo,
said
that
whenever
you
have
the
question
of
pre-emption,
or
federal
interest
versus
the
anti-injunction
statute,
that
federal
interest
pre-emption
question
must
give
way.
the
court
will
not
sit
and
balance
those
matters;
they'll
leave
it
to
congress.
and
therefore,
as
stated
in
atlantic
coast
line,
pre-emption
is
not
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
anti-injunction
statute,
so
that
i
think
the
respondents
are
misplaced
in
trying
to
contend,
as
was
judge
gee
in
the
fifth
circuit
that,
on
the
basis
of
pre-emption,
an
injunction
can
issue.
i
think
it's
clearly
contrary
to
those
three
decisions.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
well,
the
respondents
have
contended,
justice
white,
that
they
concede
there
is
a
difference
between
the
federal
forum
non
conveniens
law
and
the
state
forum
non
conveniens
law,
but
that
the
reason
that
an
injunction
can
issue
is
because
the
federal
forum
non
conveniens
law,
such
as
the
maritime
case,
pre-empts
the
state
forum
non
conveniens
law.
and
that
therefore
an
injunction
can
issue.
and
i'm
saying
that--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--it's
different,
yes
sir,
it
is.
i
think
that
chief
judge
brown
of
the
fifth
circuit
says
pre-emption
does
not
equal
res
judicata.
it's
just...
what
i'm
saying
is
they
can't
bootstrap
themselves
into
a
res
judicata
type
of
situation
which
would
justify
an
injunction
under
the
relitigation
section
using
the
doctrine
of
pre-emption.
and
that's
stated
very
foursquare
by
this
court
on
various
occasions.
so
i'm
saying
that,
even
if
they
had
raised
the
issue
exemption,
the
issue
of
pre-emption
being
the
focal
point
of
how
they
try
to
justify
this
injunction,
this
injunction
must
fall.
now
even
if
they
had...
if
the
pre-emption
doctrine
could
be
the
basis
of
an
injunction
in
other
cases,
and
it
could
possibly
have
been
in
atlantic
coast
line,
it
certainly
could
not
be
in
a
forum
non
conveniens
case.
and
there
is
a
reason
for
this:
the
main
reason
is
that
the
test
laid
down
for
both
the
second
and
third
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
statute,
being
in
the
second,
in
aid
of
jurisdiction;
and
the
third
being
the
relitigation
exception,
or
to
effectuate
and
preserve
a
judgment...
is
that
the,
in
order
for
the
injunction
to
be
justified,
the
action
in
the
state
court
must
in
some
way
interfere
with
the
adjudication
by
the
federal
court?
must
"impair",
as
i
believe
the
term
was
used,
"impair
the
adjudication"
by
the
federal
courts.
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
the
state
court
action
in
this
case
could
impair
the
federal
court
in
adjudication
of
this
matter
when
the
federal
court
says
we
don't
want
to
adjudicate
it.
we
refuse
to
adjudicate
it.
we're
dismissing
it
on
grounds
of
forum
non
conveniens,
and
by
using
the
test
that
was
laid
down,
and
i
believe
it
was
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
the
vendo
case
said
that
test
applies
to
both
the
second
and
third
exception;
and
this
was
also
discussed
in
atlantic
coast
line.
that
being
the
test,
i
don't
see
how
any
injunction
could
be
justified
in
this
case
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
state
court
action
now
that
the
federal
court
has
said
we
don't
want
to
adjudicate
this
case;
how
it
could
be
said
that
the
state
court
action
could
in
any
way
impair
the
right
of
the
power
of
the
federal
court
to
adjudicate
a
case
it
doesn't
want
to
adjudicate?
so
also,
we
believe
that
the
doctrine
itself,
when
you
look
at
the
supreme
court
cases,
this
court's
cases
on
forum
non
conveniens.
and
i'm
speaking
primarily
of
missouri
v.
mayfield
and
parsons
v.
chesapeake.
missouri
v.
mayfield
is
a
very
important
case,
in
my
opinion;
the
respondents
try
to
downplay
it.
and
it
was
an
fela
case,
not
a
maritime
case;
and
it
was
not
a
2283
case,
anti-injunction
case.
but
what
this
court
held
in
missouri
v.
mayfield
was
that
a
state
court
has
the
right
to
have
a
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
if
it
wants
to;
it
has
a
right
not
to
have
a
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
if
it
wants
to...
which
may
very
well
be
the
texas
situation
under
it's
open
forum
statute;
or
it
may
have
one
and
it's
criteria
may
differ
from
the
federal
criteria.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
well
your
honor,
i
go
right
to
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
talentire,
and
you
talk
about
the
savings
to
suitor
clause,
and
i
just
do
not
believe
and
see
that
there
is
any
way
that
there
can
be
a
pre-emption
under
uniformity
or
whatever,
a
reverse-erie,
of
a
forum
non
conveniens
determination.
the
supreme
court,
in
describing
what
a
forum
non
conveniens
determination
is
in
missouri
v.
mayfield
and
parsons
v.
chesapeake,
has
indicated
quite
clearly
that
each
court
has
a
right
to
decide
what
that
doctrine
is
and
decide
it
itself.
now,
all
the
cases
i
have
read
on
the
maritime
pre-emption,
your
honor,
have
dealt
with
substantive
rights,
and
justice
o'connor
has
made
that
statement
at
least
about
four
or
five
times
in
that
opinion
in
talentire.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
this
court
held
in
talentire
was
that
the
savings
to
suitor
clause
is
reserved
to
the
state
court's
right
the
right
to
proceed.
the
right
to
the
jurisdiction;
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
handling
maritime
cases
and
admiralty
cases.
and
if
you
were
to
agree
with
the
respondents
in
this
case,
the
savings
to
suitor
clause
would
be
wholly
nullified,
because
talentire
said
that
the
law,
the
law
of
the
state,
the
substantive
law
of
the
state,
must
give
way
to
the
substantive
law
of
the
federal
maritime
law,
and
i
can
understand
that.
but
there's
nothing
in
talentire
and
there's
nothing
in
any
of
the
uniformity
and
pre-emption
cases
that
indicates
that
a
procedural
doctrine
like
forum
non
conveniens
can
be
th
subject
of
pre-emption
or
reverse-erie
or
uniformity.
so
particularly
is
that
true
when
you
look
at
how
the
supreme
court
has
described
that
doctrine
in
missouri
v.
mayfield
and
parsons
v.
chesapeake.
so
that
my
answer
is,
that
i
believe
that
it
does
not
pre-empt.
but
i
go
back
to
my
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
even
if
it
did
not
pre-empt,
it
cannot
be
the
subject
of
an
injunction
under
2283.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
i
understand.
also,
another
reason
that
the
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine
is
not
the
kind
of
a
doctrine
that
can
be
either
pre-empted
because
it's
not
substantive,
or
is
not
the
kind
of
a
doctrine
that
can
be
the
basis
of
an
injunction
under
the
relitigation
exception
is,
if
you
read
this
court's
decisions
in
piper
v.
reyno
and
gulf
oil
v.
gilbert,
we
concede
that
this
doctrine
is
a
discretionary
doctrine;
is
one
that
says,
presupposes,
that
this
case
can
be
tried
somewhere.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
it
is
a
factor,
and
this
court
stated
in
piper
v.
reyno
that
it's
a
factor.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
i
think
it
probably
will
be,
justice
white.
but
it
has
to
be
asserted
in
the
state
court.
it
cannot
be
done
with
the
injunction
route,
because--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--you
probably
can't.
you
certainly
can't,
and
i
concede,
you
could
not
relitigate
whether
federal
maritime
law
applied
in
the
state
court.
you
could
not
relitigate
it.
but
that
would
be
a
matter
for
the
state
court
to
decide,
and
once
they
raise
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel
and
do
it
now.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
the
state
law
claim
is
the
wrongful
death
claim,
justice
brennan.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
well,
if
we
could
proceed
with
the
state
law
wrongful
death
claim,
the
texas
state
law
would
apply.
if
we
could
not,
then
foreign
law
would
apply,
and
under
old
article
467871.031--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--then
we
would
come
in
and
try
the
case
under
singapore
law
in
the
texas
state
court,
and
the
statute
persists--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--it's
a
statute
adjunct
to
the
law.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
yes.
but
there
is
a
part
of
that
statute,
your
honor,
or
subsequent
to
it,
adjunct
to
it,
which
talks
about
procedures,
and
it's
the
one
that
is
the
open
forum,
your
honor,
which
talks
about...
it
gives
a
right--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--that's
one
thing
we'd
feel
comfortable--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--justice--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--we
did
plead
it
in
state
court.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
the
plaintiff
is
from
singapore
and
the
accident
took
place
in
the
harbor
of
singapore
where
an
american
traditional
blue-water
vessel
was
there
temporarily;
at
least
it
was
owned
by
an
american
company
through
another
company;
and
the
exxon
corporation;
and
it
was
there
temporarily
for
repairs
and
plaintiff,
the
decedent,
was
on
this
vessel
to
assist
in
repairs
and
was
killed
when
a
spindle
fell
through
the
deck
onto
his
head.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
yes,
sir.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
that
would,
in
my
opinion,
would
have
been
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
case
and
it
could
be.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
but
that's
just
it,
justice
scalia,
it
was
not
fully
litigated.
the
issues
under
foreign
law;
the
issues,
i
contend,
under
texas
law,
weren't
fully
adjudicated.
the
case
was
dismissed
on
grounds
of
forum
non
conveniens.
what
was
fully
adjudicated,
we
concede,
was
the
jones
act
question,
because
the
basis
of
that
was
the
summary
judgment
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
not
a
jones
act
seaman.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
assuming
that
is
correct
as
you
stated,
and
i--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--proceed
in
arguendo,
then
it
would
have
been
fully
litigated.
but
the
foreign
law
claim
is
not
litigated,
your
honor
and
in
atlantic
coast
railway,
within
the
context
of
2283,
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about,
not
what
the
texas
court
ought
to
do
if
these
issues
are
raised
before
the
texas
court,
but
whether
or
not
the
federal--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--i
believe
so,
your
honor,
but
i
concede
that
it
was
not
an
issue
determined
in
the--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--the
reason
i
have
some
problems
with
an
answer
yes--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
if
it
was
pleaded
in
the--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--state
court,
but
our
position
would
be
that
the
court
did
not
directly
address
that
issue.
the
court,
in
order
to
have
collateral
estoppel,
as
i
understand
the
doctrine,
or
direct
estoppel,
as
judge
gee
described
it,
it
must
have
been
clearly
adjudicated.
what
the
court
really
did
is--
mr.
benton
musslewhite
--that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
that
is
what
atlantic
coast
line
says.
that's
the
way
it
proceeds.
that's
why
under
the
principles
of
federalism,
that
you
allow
the
state
court
to
proceed
and
then
after
it
proceeds
the
appeal
can
come
up
to
the
supreme
court
through
the
normal
appellate
processes.
i
reserve
my
time
to
close.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
try
to
be
very
brief.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
i
go
to
the
question
asked
by
justice
o'connor
that
i
think
was
answered
very
clearly,
justice
o'connor.
the
pre-emption
nor
the
state
forum
non
conveniens
issue,
they
were
not
raised
in
the
federal
court...
the
original
federal
court,
and
they
were
not
decided.
secondly,
688(b),
i
think
is
a
good...
not
that
you
raised
that
point,
is
a
good
point
to
close
on.
that
was
a
comprehensive
examination
of
this
whole
situation
by
congress.
they
did
not
provide
for
an
injunction
against
state
court
proceedings
in
that
law;
no
injunction
is
provided
for
in
the
"savings
to
suitors"
clause;
there's
no
injunction
that
specifically
covers
this
situation
in
the
anti-injunction
act,
so
i
say
it's
clear,
we
respectfully
submit,
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
allow
an
injunction
to
be
used
in
this
kind
of
situation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
mr.
benton
musslewhite
we
never
pursued
our
remedies
in
singapore.
my
client
has
instructed
me
to
try
to
pursue
the
remedies
in
the
state
court,
so
we
did
not
file
suit
in
singapore,
so
i
cannot
tell
you
whether
they
did
or
did
not.
mr.
benton
musslewhite
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
a
statute
that
says
you
can
file
within
a
certain
number
of
days
after
it
is
dismissed
out
of
federal
court.
if
not
any
further
questions--
