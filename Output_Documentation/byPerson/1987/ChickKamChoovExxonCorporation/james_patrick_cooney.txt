mr.
james
patrick
cooney
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
would
be
useful
at
this
time
to
focus
in
on
the
situation
in
the
state
court
as
to
exactly
what
law
applied
in
the
state
court
as
to
exactly
what
law
applied
following
the
federal
dismissal,
and
then
to
consider
what
i
think
is
the
real
issue
here
and
that
is
the
res
judicata
effect
of
the
foreign
non
conveniens
dismissal
out
of
the
federal
court.
the
federal
court
in
dismissing
the
case
held
as
has
been
admitted,
the
singapore
law
applied
and
dismissed
jones
act
longshoremen
and
harborworkers
and
osha,
and
conditioned
the
dismissal
on
the
defendant
making
itself
available
in
singapore.
i
think
there
is
a
real
question
as
to
whether
texas
or
any
state
claim
that
can
still
be
in
existence.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
very
straightforward:
a
shipyard
worker
resident
in
singapore
died
while
employed
by
a
singapore
shipyard
working
on
a
liberian
flag
vessel
which
is
admittedly
indirectly
owned
by
exxon.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
i
think
the
foreign
law
claim...
it's
difficult
to
see
how
the
foreign
law
claim
comes
up,
and
certainly
not
in
the
context
that
mr.
musslewhite
suggests.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
they
claim
under
foreign
law
in
the
texas
wrongful
death
statute.
the
section
that
we're
dealing
with
provides
for
foreign
law
claims.
and
the
reason
i
raise
the
question,
it
may
simply
be
a
point
of
technicality,
but
as
i
understand
talentire,
if
it
stands
for
anything,
it
says
that
state
law
cannot
provide
a
wrongful
death
remedy,
or
even
cannot
augment
a
wrongful
death
remedy
in
a
maritime
situation,
as
a
matter
of
a
united
states
general
maritime
law,
singapore
law
applies.
that's
the
choice
of
law
decision.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
it
is
part
of
a
texas
wrongful
death
claim,
yes,
your
honor,
because
that
was
the
statute
that
was
invoked
here.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
they
claimed
a
right,
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
right
claimed
was
a
part
of--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--that
claim
is
alive,
and
that
claim
is
subject
to
be
adjudicated--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--absolutely
not.
and
that's
the
whole
point
of
the
forum
non
conveniens
dismissal,
yes
your
honor.
to
the
extent
that
it's--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--yes,
your
honor.
to
the
extent
that
it's
alive...
it's
not.
to
the
extent
that
it's
alive
in
singapore.
to
give
some
history:
the
1980--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--going
ahead
at
all.
here's
the
procedural
situation:
in
1980
this
case
was
dismissed
as
forum
non
conveniens.
no
action
was
commenced
in
singapore.
instead
an
action
was
commenced
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
texas.
and
we
have
taken
the
position
here
that
the
forum
non
conveniens
dismissal
in
a
maritime
situation
under
the
uniformity
doctrine
is
binding
on
the
state
courts,
and
that
this
particular
type
of
forum
non
conveniens
dismissal
constitutes
more
substantive
determination,
which
essentially
decides
that
the
courts
of
this
country
are
going
to
decide
this
issue
because
of
international
comity;
because
of
the
contacts
of
a
foreign
state;
because
the
fact
that
the
foreign
state's
law
applies
under
our
general
maritime
law,
it
would
be
better
to
determine
it
in
that
fashion.
and
so
the
federal
court
has
decided
to
stay
its
hand.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
i
believe
that
it
did,
your
honor.
you
know,
it
didn't
come
out
and
say
in
bold
letters
in
the
judgment,
"this
case
shall
be
decided
only
in
the
courts
of
singapore.
"
but
it
did
hold,
number
one,
that
the
singapore
law
applied,
and
it
conditioned
the
forum
non
conveniens
dismissal--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--i
think
it
goes
on
to
discuss,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
it
appears
to
be
controlled
by
the
law
of
singapore.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
i
believe
that
it's
in
there,
your
honor.
and
specifically
it
conditioned
the
dismissal--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--yes,
and
that
was
proved
up
in
the
district
courts.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
as
it
now
stands,
your
honor,
i
am
advised...
i
don't
know
for
a
fact,
that
they
have
expired,
principally
because
no
litigation
was
commenced
in
singapore
in
1980
or
1981.
they,
i
think,
have
a
six-year
statute.
this
case...
this
man
died
in
1977.
the
case
began
in
1978
and
has
been
going
on
a
long
time.
the
narrow
issue
here,
i
think,
is
the
propriety
of
the
injunction;
and
that
raises
the
question
whether
under
the
uniformity
doctrine,
a
state
court
is
bound
to
apply
the
same
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine
that
has
developed
in
the
maritime
courts
of
this
country
following
gilbert
and
following
reyno.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
doctrine
is
somewhat
different
from
the
gulf
v.
gilbert
and
the
reyno
decisions.
both
of
those
are
diversity
cases.
gulf
v.
gilbert
in
the
decision
admitted
that
it
was
drawing
from
maritime
sources
for
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens.
but
i
think
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
as
it
now
stands
in
the
federal
courts
as
a
maritime
doctrine,
is
different,
and
it's
different
in
this
respect:
it
is
a
hybrid.
it
relies
at
least
in
part
on
this
court's
decisions
in
lauritzen
and
rhoditis,
and
romero,
where
the
court
specifically
addressed
the
choice
of
law
problem
with
regard
to
our
jones
act;
with
regard
to
our
general
maritime
law,
and
addressed
the
problems
of
international
comity.
the
accommodations
that
have
to
restrain
our
courts
and
any
court...
any
maritime
court,
from
exercising
its
power
to
its
fullest
scope.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
your
honor,
it
did
cite
lauritzen,
and
lauritzen
was
clearly
briefed.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
i
believe
that
it
was
at
the
genesis
of
this
development,
your
honor,
and
let
me
put
it
this
way:
clearly
the
argument...
in
fact,
at
this
time,
there
were
cases
on
the
books,
and
this
determination
in
the
district
court
can
be
interpreted
to
mean
simply
that
once
you
made
the
lauritzen...
rhoditis
determination
of
choice
of
law,
if
it
was
not
u.s.
law,
forum
non
conveniens
automatically
followed.
in
years
subsequent,
the
doctrine
has
become
somewhat
more
developed,
and
is
continuing
to
develop.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
the
issue
was
presented
to
the
federal
court
in
that
fashion.
i
think
the
briefs
are
in
the
appendix;
it
was
argued
as
a
lauritzen...
rhoditis;
and
admittedly
in
1980
the
next
step,
and
that
is
whether
a
full-blown
gilbert
analysis
was
necessary
or
whether
simply
a
dismissal
forum
non
conveniens
once
the
choice
of
law
matter
was
determined,
was
up
in
the
air.
admittedly
the
district
court's
order
is
a
little
sketchy
on
this
point,
but
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
context
of
how
the
case
was
argued
and
submitted
to
the
court,
yes,
indeed,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
was--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i
don't
think
it
was
even
necessary.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
under
the
maritime
concept
of
forum
non
conveniens
as
it
was
then
developing.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
i
believe
that
it
has,
your
honor.
i
think
starting
with
jensen,
the
pre-emption
issue
is
really
the
uniformity
issue,
and
there
is
no
pre-emption
issue
here.
it's
a
question
of
whether
a
forum
non
conveniens
decision
made
by
a
federal
court
in
a
maritime
context
is
preclusive:
does
it
constitute
a
res
judicata...
collateral
estoppel
binding
effect
on
the
state
court,
given
the
fact
that
the
state
courts
under
the
fact
that
the
savings
to
suitors
clause,
are
bound
to
follow
federal
law.
that's
the
whole
essence
of
the
uniformity
doctrine.
the
pre-emption
cases
that
counsel
alludes
to
are
statutory
pre-emption
matters
that
are
entirely
different
from
the
situation
we
have
here.
atlantic
coast
line,
there
was
a
strike
down
in
florida,
a
railroad
strike.
that
district
court
enjoined
that
court
under
federal
law.
subsequent
to
that
injunction,
as
i
understand
it,
another
case
held
that
state
law
under
which
an
injunction
had
been
obtained
against
the
strike,
was
pre-empted
under
federal
law,
and
immediately
the
parties
went
back
to
the
federal
district
court
and
said,
"give
us
an
injunction
to
keep
the
state
injunction
from
being
enforced.
"
i
think
that's
an
entirely
different
situation.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
absolutely--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--a
judgment:
a
judgment
saying
this
case
should
be
dismissed
for
forum
non
conveniens,
and
that
is
the
very
crux
of
the
issue.
without
the
judgment,
i
will
readily
admit
a
federal
court
could
not
issue
an
injunction
to
keep
a
state
court
from
hearing
any
case.
in
this
situation,
we
have
a
judgment
of
a
federal
court
saying
that
this
case
before
us
because
of
the
contacts
it
has
with
a
foreign
nation,
cannot
be
tried
by
a
state
court.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
i
think
they
had
to
say
"without
prejudice",
your
honor,
because
without
doing
that
there
would
be
nothing
left
to
try
in
singapore.
let
me
give
you...
this
was
addressed
by
the--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--yes,
your
honor.
and
it
had
to
be
forum
non
conveniens
dismissal
just
as
say,
a
dismissal
under
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
without
prejudice.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
depending
on
what
kind
of
forum
non
conveniens
determination
we're
making,
your
honor,
following
gulf
v.
gilbert,
congress
passed
1404a,
so
that
virtually
any
indigenous
domestic
forum
non
conveniens
determination
in
the
federal
courts
is
now
made
on
the
basis
of
the
transfer
statute.
the
only
time
forum
non
conveniens
comes
up
in
the
federal
context
is
in
piper
v.
reyno
type
situations,
where
the
question
is
should
this
federal
court...
is
this
the
convenient
forum,
or
is
the
convenient
forum
outside
of
the
united
states?
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
under
the
rubric
of
forum
non
conveniens
we
now
have
essentially
two
different
problems
that
are
being
addressed
and
two
different
solutions.
one
we
have
the
ease
in
convenience
problem...
why
try
this
case
in
virginia
when
it's
easier
to
try
it
in
washington
because
that's
where
everyone
is?
versus
the
case,
as
in
this
case,
as
in
the
kassapas
case,
which
decided
an
almost
identical
situation,
but
for
injunction,
out
of
the
courts
of
louisiana.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
your
honor,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
facts
in
the
case
and
what
we're
trying
to
do
with
forum
non
conveniens.
i
think
that
there
is...
the
federal
court
could
have
said,
"our
dockets
are
crowded;
it's
not
convenient
to
try
the
case
here;
we
frankly
don't
care
you
try
it;
try
it
elsewhere.
"
on
the
other
hand,
the
federal
court
could
have
said,
"this
is
not
governed
by
federal
law;
it's
governed
by
the
law
of
another
nation.
"
"the
contacts
of
that
other
nation
are
predominant;
we
do
not
believe
that
any
court
in
this
country
should
try
the
case;
it
should
be
tried
in
singapore
or
in
nigeria
or
in
great
britain,
or
wherever.
"
"and
i
think
those
are
two
different
things.
"
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
i
think
that
it
again
depending
upon
what
policy
the
court
was
addressing,
it
is
in
fact
necessary,
and
perhaps
logically
necessary.
if
we're
talking
about
an
accommodation
of
the
international
concerns
that
were
addressed
in
lauritzen
and
rhoditis,
and
to
some
extent
in
piper
v.
reyno.
to
say
that
a
court
can
sit
down
and
decide
that
this
case
should
not
properly
or
suitably
be
brought
or
tried
in
the
united
states,
and
then
refuse
to
give
any
meat
to
that
decision,
and
allow
a
state
court
six
blocks
down
the
street
to
pick
up
the
case
completely
nullifies
what
the
doctrine
is
all
about.
if
we're
speaking--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
we're
approaching
that.
i
don't
suggest
that
it
is
a
constitutional
thing.
i
suggest,
however,
that
it
is
in
line
with
the
concerns
with
the
court
in
lauritzen.
it
is
a
manner,
or
at
least
it
is
a
device,
and
i
think
it
is
used
by
the
maritime
courts
as
a
device
to
handle
the
accommodations
that
these
courts
think
are
necessary
when
cases
that
have
absolutely
no
contact
with
the
united
states
are
brought
here.
all
that--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--well,
in
fact,
in
the
zipfel
case,
as
i
understand
it,
that's
about
what
happened,
your
honor,
when
they
got
their
forum
non
conveniens
dismissal,
because
there
was
already
a
state
action
pending
in
texas.
this
was
out
of
a
ninth
circuit
and
certiorari
is
pending
in
this
case.
they
requested
the
district
court
to
enter
an
injunction
at
that
time,
and
the
injunction
was
entered
and
it
was
vacated.
and
in
fact
this
was
a
case
joined
to
this
one
as
a
matter
of
conflict.
in
that
case,
it
was
clear
that
an
airplane
accident
had
occurred
in
indonesia;
the
operator
of
the
airplane
was
an
indonesian,
and
as
far
as
i
can
read
that
determination,
the
district
court
was
contemplating
that
this
was
the
kind
of
case
that
ought
to
be
tried
in
indonesia...
not
simply
"i
am
an
inconvenient
forum,
or
it's
going
to
be
difficult
for
the
parties
before
me
to
prosecute
this
case.
"
a
much
more
fundamental
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
well,
your
honor--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--i
would
respectfully
disagree
on
that
on
two
grounds,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
at
least
in
this
context--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--in
this
context
a
state
court
handling
a
maritime
matter
is
acting
pursuant
to
a
savings
to
suitors
clause,
and
is
therefore
bound
by
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
"reverse-erie"
doctrine
or
the
'uniformity
"doctrine".
the
second
thing
is,
i
think
what
has
developed
in
chiazor
and
vaz
borralho
and
a
number
of
cases
in
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--that's
right.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
it
happens
in
this
sense,
your
honor,
and
only
in
this
sense:
admittedly
forum
non
conveniens
is
a
discretionary
tool;
the
district
judge
does
not
have
to
grant
it.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
no,
i'm
not
after
protecting
the
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
i
simply--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--all
i
can
say,
your
honor,
that
if
a
dismissal
from
a
federal
court
contemplating
further
litigation
in
a
foreign
country
is
not
binding
on
the
state
courts,
at
least
in
the
maritime
situation.
it's
a
nullity.
and
it
does
not
accomplish
the
purpose
that
the
courts
were
attempting
to
reach.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
not
completely
that,
because
i
think
there
are
good
policy
grounds
for
doing
this.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
the
state
court
in
this
instance,
your
honor,
is
a
maritime
court.
it
is
bound
to
apply
the
same
law
as
the
federal
court.
we
believe
that
it
is
also
bound
to
apply
the
same
forum
non
conveniens
analysis
that
the
federal
maritime
court
is
bound
to
apply.
if
that's
the
case;
if
that
issue
has
already
been
decided,
it's
a
collateral
estoppel,
or
a
direct
estoppel
by
judgment...
that
decision
has
been
made,
providing
the
objective
facts
do
not
change,
as
was
found
in
this
case...
nothing
changed.
this
was
not
a
decision
made
on
the
basis
of
overloaded
docket
or
direct
convenience
to
the
parties.
and
i
think
that
the
cases
that
have
followed
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
this
is
perhaps
the
broader
issue
that
we
face
here...
and
in
other
circuits,
have
moved
towards
the
idea
that
once
we
decide
u.s.
law
does
not
apply,
that
it
is
a
matter
of
international
comity,
that
a
line
has
to
be
drawn.
if
the
uniformity
doctrine
does
not
apply,
that
same
rule
of
decision
to
the
state
courts,
so
that
the
state
courts
are
bound
once
a
federal
court
makes
a
decision,
then
literally
in
a
forum
non
conveniens
context,
of
a
foreign
claim...
i'm
not
talking
about
a
u.s.
claim
here,
but
of
a
foreign
claim,
that
if
a
federal
court
says,
"no,
we
won't
hear
it.
"
the
plaintiffs
are
free
to
go
from
court
to
court
until
they
find
someone
who
will
take
it.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
i
doubt
i
would
unless--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--no.
it
relies
on
an
important
part
on
that,
but
not
entirely,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
an
important
component
on
what
i
would
suggest
is
the
developing
hybrid
concern.
the
courts
that
the
decisions
that
have
gone
in
this
direction
to
say
these
cases
belong
in
courts
other
than
the
united
states
courts,
rely
on
choice
of
law;
the
place
of
the
accident...
really
a
contacts
analysis
of
what
nation
has
the
primary
interest,
if
you
will,
or
primary
contacts
with
this
particular
piece
of
litigation.
and
that,
you
know,
is
the
situation
here
as
a
good
example.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
if
the
federal
court
completely--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--i
don't
think
i
have
the
same
case,
your
honor.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
if
we
say--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--i
would
disagree
that
it's
entirely
on
the
choice
of
law
point.
i
think
it's
that
plus,
you
know,
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
but
certainly
that,
and
i
would
have
to
say
that,
if
you
took
the
choice
of
law,
the
determination
that
foreign
law
applied,
and
said
american
law
applied,
i
do
not
have
my
case
and
i
would
not
be
making
the
arguments
that
i'm
making.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
can,
and
that's
another
question.
i
think
the
narrow
question
here
is
whether
after
they
have
passed
that
statute,
they
are
free
to
exercise
that
law
given
the
federal
determination.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
it's
binding.
--the
argument
here--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--you
see,
i
go
one
step
further,
your
honor,
and
say
that
the
forum
non
conveniens
dismissal,
once
it
has
been
made,
is
also
binding
on
the
state
court
because
the
state
court
has
a
savings
to
suitors
maritime
court
is
bound
to
apply
the
same
law
as
the
federal
court.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
no,
not
the
forum
non
conveniens
law,
your
honor.
excuse
me,
i
think
we're
confusing
the
point.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
it
must
frame
the
issues
under
federal
law
as
would
be
framed,
and
he
must
apply
the
same
criteria...
clearly
it's
discretionary.
if
he
were
looking
at
it
initially,
he
perhaps
could
come
to
a...
a
state
judge
could
perhaps
come
to
a
conclusion,
but
as
in
pastewka,
in
the
third
circuit,
once
that
determination
is
made,
once
that
discretion
has
been
exercise,
an
estoppel
by
judgment
arises
and
that
issue
has
been
decided.
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
state
court
to
decide.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
in
this
instance
it's
a
question
of
federal
law.
it
would
be
a
question
of
federal
maritime
law
as
to
what
effect
a
federal
maritime
court
would
give--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--i
think
generally,
your
honor,
courts
have
the
power,
and
i
think
there
is
a
case
in
my
brief
though
it
does
not
come
to
mind
immediately,
that
has
the
power
to
determine
the
effect
of
their
own
judgment,
and
that's
kind
of
an
inherent
power
of
the
court.
i
don't
think
that
it's
for
the
state
court
as
a
maritime
court
applying
maritime
law...
it's
going
to
have
to
apply
federal
law
also
to
determine
what
law
applies.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
that
becomes
the
uniformity
question,
your
honor,
and
that
gets,
i
guess
to
the
nub
of
this
case,
and
that
is
whether
the
federal
forum
non
conveniens
law
as
a
rule
of
decision
is
binding
upon
the
state
courts
under
the
uniformity
doctrine?
i
don't
believe
that
that
analysis
involves
pre-emption,
as
i
have
tried
to
make
clear.
i
think
the
pre-emption
cases
involve
an
entirely
different
circumstance.
this
is
a
uniformity
case
and
it's
a
res
judicata
case.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
absent
the
forum
non
conveniens
determination?
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
okay,
well
then,
my
answer
simply
is
that
the
forum
non
conveniens
determination
is
binding
on
the
state
court,
and
it
is
not--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--because
its
maritime
law
is
binding
on
the
state
court.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
no,
it's
a
uniformity
question,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
in
determining
what
the
res
judicata
effect
or
binding
effect
of
a
law--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--yes,
and
i
think--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--it's
a
substantive...
yes,
your
honor,
because
if
my
analysis
of
what
maritime
forum
non
conveniens
is,
it
fully
adjudicates
the
case
in
the
united
states,
subject
to
the
conditional
retention
of
the
case,
should
it
not
go
forward
in
the
foreign
forum.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
the
choice
of
law
argument,
your
honor,
is
a
constituent...
it's
a
difficult
situation.
let
me
back
up
and
try
to
give
some
background:
up
until
very
recently,
at
least
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
in
many
of
the
circuits,
the
analysis
for
forum
non
conveniens
was
initially
a
two-step
analysis,
and
first
was
doesn't
u.s.
law
apply
under
lauritzen
and
roditis?
if
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
then
you
proceed
to
step
two,
which
is
the
gilbert
v.
gulf.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
i
think
that
both
judge
gee
and
judge
clark's
use
of
the
word,
"pre-emption"
has
been
very
unfortunate,
and
i
regret
it.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
it
has
given
everyone
an
opportunity
to
focus
on
pre-emption,
because--
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
--and
i
don't
think
this
is
a
pre-emption
case.
this
is
a
reverse-erie
case.
this
is
a
res
judicata
case.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
certainly
they
can.
i
think
what
you
would
do
is
you
would
take
the
meat
out
of
the
forum
non
conveniens
laws
that
now
exist,
in
federal
maritime
courts.
and
we're
having
a
lot
of
these
cases.
this
is
not
an
isolated
problem.
there
are
many
of
these
cases
coming
up.
if
we
don't
win
here,
we
go
forward
in
state
court,
which
means
that
the
battle
has
been
won
in
the
federal
courts.
the
reason
that
the
focus
is
now
in
the
state
courts
is
that
the
federal
courts
have
accepted
this
doctrine;
they
are
dismissing
cases
for
trial
overseas;
they
are
issuing
injunctions...
this
is
not
the
only
injunction.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
i'm
not
aware
of
the
new
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
oh,
i
think
that
it's
supportive
of
the
policy
behind
this.
it
does
not
directly
solve
this
case.
mr.
james
patrick
cooney
and
this
was
in
response
to
this
problem
of
foreign
maritime
workers
coming
to
this
country.
an
amendment
was
passed
to
the
jones
act
to
specifically
deprive
them
of
jones
act
general
maritime
law
remedies,
again
conditioning
it
upon
the
availability
of
the
national
or
foreign
forum,
the
non-u.
s.
forum.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
pronouncement
from
congress
supports
the
policy
underlying
what
has
been
developing
in
the
non-oil
worker
cases...
these
are
all
offshore...
this
amendment
is
specific
to
offshore
oil
workers.
thank
you,
your
honor.
