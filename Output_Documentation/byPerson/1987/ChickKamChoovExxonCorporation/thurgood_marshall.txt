justice
marshall
what
is
the
statute
of
limitations
in
singapore?
justice
marshall
you
also
said
"without
prejudice"?
that's
a
very
broad
reading
of
the
state
law.
what
do
you
think
about
"without
prejudice"
now?
justice
marshall
they
could
have
said
that.
they
said
"without
prejudice".
justice
marshall
i
just
have
great
difficulty
seeing
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
decide
what
a
state
court
can
do
on
forum
non
conveniens?
justice
marshall
i
don't
think
forum
non
conveniens
can
apply
to
any
but
that
court.
not
only
that,
i
don't
think
it
can
decide
if
any
other
federal
court...
they
only
say
"for
this
court".
is
a
forum
non
conveniens.
that's
all
the
court...
any
court...
can
say.
justice
marshall
straighten
me
out.
justice
marshall
and
this
would
be
binding
on
the
state
court?
justice
marshall
by
what
jurisdiction...
what
statute...
does
that
happen
on?
come
on?
justice
marshall
to
protect
its
jurisdiction...
and
not
somebody
else's?
you
want
it
to
protect
somebody
else's
too?
justice
marshall
you
want
to
protect
the
state
court's
jurisdiction.
you
want
the
federal
court
to
protect
the
state
court's
jurisdiction.
justice
marshall
it's
a
matter
of
necessity.
that's
your
theory?
justice
marshall
that
the
state
court
can't
protect
itself?
