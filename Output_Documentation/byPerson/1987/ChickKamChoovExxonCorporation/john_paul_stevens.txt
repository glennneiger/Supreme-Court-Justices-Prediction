justice
stevens
i
don't
find
that.
justice
stevens
it
says
there
are
remedies
available
in
the
courts,
in
the
singapore
courts.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
cooney,
supposing
a
federal
court
had
said
there
are
a
lot
of
factors
that
one
looks
at
in
your
forum
non
conveniens
determination,
one
of
which
is
the
law
to
apply.
and
it
analyzed
the
law
and
found
that
singapore
law
and
american
maritime
law
were
pretty
much
the
same,
and
says,
"i'm
really
not
certain
about
the
law.
"
it
may
well
be
that
american
law
would
apply.
"but
nevertheless,
i'm
going
to
dismiss
the
complaint
because
all
of
the
witnesses
are
in
singapore;
the
accident
took
place
there;
the
plaintiff
lived
there;
a
lot
of
other
reasons.
"
and
then
dismissed
on
forum
non
conveniens
grounds.
would
you
make
the
same
kind
of
argument
here?
justice
stevens
your
argument
depends
entirely
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
determination
on
the
choice
of
law
issue?
justice
stevens
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled.
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question?
you
would
or
would
not
make
the
claim
that
the
federal
court
in
the
hypothesis
i
gave
you
could
enjoin
the
state
proceeding?
justice
stevens
say
it
says
that
american
maritime
law
applies,
or
it's
the
same
as
singapore
law,
but
all
these
other
factors
support
a
determination
that--
justice
stevens
--i
know
you
wouldn't
have
the
same
case,
but
would
you
have
any
case
at
all?
justice
stevens
so
your
case
does,
then,
rest
entirely
on
the
choice
of
law
point?
justice
stevens
why
is
it
that
you
say
a
texas
court
could
not
say
"we
will...
the
texas
legislature
couldn't
pass
a
statute
saying,
we
will
entertain
causes
of
action
based
on
singapore
law?
"
justice
stevens
the
federal
court
determination
is
controlling
in
the
case.
justice
stevens
well,
then
why
can't
texas
say,
"we
grant
the
fact
that
we
must
apply
singapore
law,
but
we're
willing
to
try
the
case
and
involve
singapore
law?
"
justice
stevens
which
is
singapore
law.
why
can't--
justice
stevens
--you're
saying
that
because
it's
a
maritime
case
the
texas
court
must
apply
precisely
the
same
analysis
that
the
federal
court
does
in
its
forum
non
conveniens
analysis?
justice
stevens
is
the
question
whether
an
estoppel
by
judgment
has
arisen
a
question
of
federal
law
or
a
question
of
state
law?
justice
stevens
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
justice
stevens
i
understand
the
determining
the
effect
of
its
own
judgment,
but
that
freely
is
analytically
different
from
the
second
court
determining
whether
or
not
that
judgment
must
be
given
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
affecting
its
court,
and
that's
what--
justice
stevens
yes,
but
now
you're
arguing
that
the
determination
on
the
choice
of
law
issue
isn't
all
that
important,
and
you
gave
me
the
exact
opposite
answer
earlier.
justice
stevens
yes,
i
just
have
one
question.
the
magistrate's
recommendation
was
that
your
opponent
waive
any
statute
of
limitations
if
the
case
was
dismissed.
did
they
do
that?
justice
stevens
and
you're
filing
in
the
texas
court
was
within
the
limitations
period,
i
take
it,
i
gather?
