chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
afternoon
in
no.
87-505,
chick
cam
choo
v.
exxon
corporation.
mr.
musslewhite,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
say
whether
the
collateral
estoppel
claim
would
win
or
lose
would
not
be
the
basis
for
an
injunction
under
the
anti-injunction
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
don't
you
read
judge
gee's
opinion...
which
i
realize
you
are
challenging,
as
saying
that
in
maritime
cases
such
as
this,
a
state
doesn't
have
the
latitude
that
it
might
have
in
an
fela
case,
to
have
its
own
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine?
chief
justice
rehnquist
those
are
two
both
different
points.
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
did
this
accident
take
place
and
where
do
the
plaintiffs
reside?
chief
justice
rehnquist
texas
really
means
what
it
says
when
it
says
"open
courts",
then,
doesn't
it?
your
honor,
that's
for
the
texas
legislature
to
say
and
i'm
not
going
to
sit
here
and
criticize
or
not,
but
nevertheless,
it
has
been,
as
judge
gee
states
in
the
opinion,
it
appears
based
on
what
the
supreme
court
of
texas
commented
in
katz
v.
chevron
that
its
intent
is
to
allow
its
in
personam
jurisdiction
to
allow
the
matter
to
proceed
through
the
texas
courts
even
though
it
may
be
on
the
basis
of
foreign
law.
mr.
musslewhite,
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
your
contention
with
regard
to
the
collateral
estoppel
effect
of
the
federal
court
determination,
if
assuming
it
was
made,
and
i
understand
you
are
not
willing
to
concede
it
was,
but
assuming
the
federal
court
in
the
course
of
determining
forum
non
conveniens,
did
decide
that
singapore
law
applies;
texas
law
does
not
apply.
as
i
understand
you,
you
say
you
can't
issue
an
injunction
against
the
bringing
of
a
texas
law
action,
because
the
federal
decision
was
not
a
merits
decision.
had
the
federal
decision
been
a
merits
decision,
then
you
would
be
able
to
enjoin?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
musslewhite.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
cooney.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
go
back
to
amalgamated
clothing
workers
v.
richmond,
which
atlantic
coast
line
reaffirms,
and
you
have
a
flat
case
where
the
claim
was
the
state
court
has
no
business
in
this
area
because
these
kinds
of
suits
are
pre-empted
by
the
nlra,
and
this
court
said,
"that
may
be
so,
but
you
can't
enjoin
it.
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
why
is
this
case
different?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
would
a
federal
court
have
any
business
in
a
forum
non
conveniens
motion
before
it
saying
that
a
state
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
try
this?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
suggests
a
forum
non
conveniens
that
is
kind
of
almost
a
constitutional
type
thing,
not
just
a
doctrine
of
convenience
as
among
federal
courts.
chief
justice
rehnquist
could
i
walk
in...
could
i,
as
a
defendant,
walk
into
federal
court
and
make
a
motion
where
the
plaintiffs
have
filed
action
saying
"i
want
this
dismissed
for
forum
non
conveniens
and
i
want
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
state
court
in
houston
has
no
jurisdiction?
"
would
a
federal
court
entertain
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cooney.
mr.
musslewhite,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
have
much
choice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
musslewhite.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
three
cases
and
the
first
of
them,
no.
87-505
chick
kam
choo
versus
exxon
corporation,
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
involves
the
propriety
of
an
order
issued
by
a
federal
district
court
enjoining
the
petitioners
from
litigating
a
certain
wrongful
death
action
in
the
texas
state
courts.
the
question
presented
is
whether
this
injunction
is
permissible
in
light
of
the
anti-injunction
act,
which
generally
bars
federal
courts
from
enjoining
state
court
proceedings.
we
hold
that
the
injunction
actually
entered
is
broader
than
the
limited,
one
we
find
permissible.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
o'connor,
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
justice
white
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
