justice
scalia
it
was
decided
that
singapore
law
would
apply,
though
wasn't
it?
justice
scalia
wasn't
there
in
the
attempted
state
action
a
claim
under
state
law
filed?
justice
scalia
do
you
concede
that
that,
at
least,
could
be
enjoined?
justice
scalia
why
not?
that
was
decided
by
the
federal
court.
justice
scalia
but
the
necessary
predicate
of
that
forum
non
conveniens
decision
was
the
determination
that
the
governing
substantive
law
was
not
the
law
of
the
united
states.
justice
scalia
just
federal?
justice
scalia
didn't
they
say
that
singapore
law
governed?
justice
scalia
it
did
say
that
foreign
law
applied?
justice
scalia
if
that's
the
essence
of
the
decision,
why
can't
they
enjoin
the
bringing
of
an
action
under
the
law
of
any
of
the
united
states?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
that
now.
i'm
just
talking
about
trying
to
bring
an
action
saying
after
the
federal
court
said
singapore
law
applies;
that's
all
been
fought
out;
it's
been
litigated;
it's
been
decided;
then
you
try
it
again
in
state
court,
and
we
think
state
law
should
govern.
federal
court
just
said
no.
justice
scalia
and
if
that's
so,
the
federal
court
could,
if
the
other
requirements
of
the
discretionary
judgment
are
met,
could
enjoin
the
bringing
of
that
claim
that
is
already
determined
by
the
federal
court?
justice
scalia
mr.
musslewhite,
is
it
clear
that
the
federal
decision
was
not
a
decision
on
the
merits
with
regard
to
the
state
claim
and
the
federal
law
claim?
justice
scalia
even
though
you're
not
seeking
to
overturn
the
federal
decision
in
the
latter
case;
you're
just
trying
to
relitigate
one
fact.
let's
assume
the
federal
decision
was
on
some
tort
action
under
federal
law
and
it
decided
that
a
did
not
hit
b.
and
then
you
bring
a
suit
and
the
federal
claim
is
dismissed...
then
you
bring
a
suit
in
a
state
court,
a
totally
different
cause
of
action;
a
state
cause
of
action;
but
it
is
essential
to
prove
your
case
to
show
that
a
hit
b.
now,
could
that
state
proceeding
be
enjoined?
justice
scalia
it
could
be.
what
difference...
well,
in
both
cases
you're
just
protecting
the
collateral
estoppel
effect
of
a
matter
that
was
fully
litigated
before
federal
court.
why
should
you
draw
the
line
between
the
matter
that
was
fully
litigated
resulted
in
a
merits
dismissal
or
a
non-merits
dismissal
in
order
to
determine
whether
you
can
prevent
the
collateral
estoppel?
justice
scalia
whether
texas
law
applies
was
fully-litigated.
that
issue
was
fully-litigated,
wasn't
it?
justice
scalia
yes,
yes.
i
understand.
justice
scalia
well,
but
did
the
federal
court
decide
that
law
you
just
described?
justice
scalia
well,
it
didn't
even
say
that
in
so
many
words,
did
it?
the
magistrate
said
that
it
was
the
conclusion
of
the
magistrate
that
the
contacts
do
not
warrant
the
application
of
federal
maritime
law
of
the
united
states
to
otherwise
foreign
transactions,
that's
all
it
said,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
federal
court
opinion
didn't
cite
any
of
these
cases.
it
didn't
get
into
this
analysis,
did
it?
justice
scalia
did
it
decide
this
particular
legal
issue
that
you
are
now
asking
us
to
decide?
justice
scalia
at
this
stage
i
am
really
less
interested
in
whether
it
really
follows.
it
may
follow
as
night
the
day;
then
i
am
interested
in
whether
the
federal
court
concluded
that
it
followed.
so
that
the
federal
court
has
already
decided
this
issue,
we
don't
have
to
wait
for
the
state
court
to
decide
it
first.
justice
scalia
mr.
cooney,
i
don't
think
you're
answering
the
chief
justice's
question.
i
think
he
wanted
to
know
why,
in
order
to
make
its
decision
about
whether
this
federal
court
was
a
convenient
forum
or
not,
that
federal
court
would
have
had
to
address
the
question
of
whether
a
state
court
could
go
ahead.
it's
totally
unnecessary
to
its
decision...
unlike,
i
might
add,
and
i
would
wish
you
address
more
of
your
fire
to
that...
unlike
the
decision
of
whether
texas
law
could
apply...
that
i
can
understand
was
necessary
to
its
forum
non
conveniens
decision.
but
i
don't
see
how
it's
necessary
for
its
decision
to
determine
whether
the
state
court
could
entertain
this
suit
if
it
wanted
to?
justice
scalia
it
might
have
said
that.
it
could
have
said
it's
going
to
rain
tomorrow
too.
but
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
to
its
decision
to
dismiss
the
suit
for
federal
forum
non
conveniens
in
the
case
before
it.
