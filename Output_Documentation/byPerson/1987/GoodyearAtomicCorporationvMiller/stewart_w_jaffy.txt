mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
an
employee
in
the
state
of
ohio,
i'm
covered
by
the
ohio
workers
compensation
law.
i'm
covered
as
an
attorney
during
my
work.
i
would
be
covered
if
i
worked
in
a
factory.
i
would
be
covered
if
i
worked
for
the
goodyear
company,
which
is
an
ohio
corporation,
and
i
would
be
covered
if
i
worked
for
goodyear
atomic,
which
is
a
subsidiary
of
the
goodyear
corporation.
and
in
fact,
the
appellant
and
the
solicitor
general
concede
that
mr.
miller,
the
person
who
was
injured
in
the
industrial
accident,
is
covered
under
the
ohio
workers
compensation
law,
and
covered
pursuant
to
40
u.s.c.
section
20.
no
argument
on
that
part
of
it.
what
the
appellant
would
like
to
do
is
to
carve
out
part
of
that
ohio
workers
compensation
law,
persuade
you
that
in
fact
it
is
not
really
workers'
compensation,
and
tell
you
for
that
reason
it
does
not
enjoy
the
protection
of
40
u.s.c.
section
290.
i'm
going
to
discuss
with
you
today
a
little
bit
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
some
of
the
history
that
will
explain
to
you
how
it
is
that
this
provision
for
additional
compensation
was
placed
into
the
ohio
constitution
and
provides
this
additional
compensation
to
injured
workers
in
ohio.
in
addition
to
that,
i
will
discuss
some
statutory
interpretation
with
you.
as
is
probably
clear
to
you,
mr.
miller,
while
working
for
goodyear
atomic,
was
engaged
in
maintenance
work.
he
was
not
doing
radiological
work.
he
was
standing
on
top
of
a
manually
propelled
scaffold
or
high
horse
ladder,
as
it's
called.
the
ladder
is
such
that
it
may
be
lowered
to
the
ground,
it
may
be
raised
to
a
height
of
sixteen
feet.
it
has
a
platform
on
the
top
of
it,
and
there's
a
guard
rail
so
that
a
person
does
not
unwittingly
fall
off.
what
really
happened
was
that
mr.
miller
needed
to
lower
he
ladder.
in
order
to
do
that,
he
first
had
to
lower
the
guard
rail.
now,
there
he
is
in
a
squatting
position
on
the
ladder
starting
to
lower
the
guard
rail,
and
what
happened
was
that
a
projection
from
the
rail,
a
bolt
that
protruded,
caught
the
glove
that
he
was
wearing,
pulled
him
off
balance,
he
fell
to
the
ground,
fractured
his
ankle,
injured
his
heel.
now,
no
argument
that
it
happened,
no
argument
that
it's
covered
under
ohio
workers
compensation
law,
no
argument
that
in
fact
goodyear
atomic
is
a
complying
employer
under
the
ohio
law.
goodyear
pays
premiums
to
the
state
of
ohio
for
workers
compensation
coverage.
and
in
fact
when
this
accident
happened,
goodyear
certified
the
claim.
they
said
to
the
state
of
ohio,
yes
this
happened,
yes
this
man
is
covered,
yes
he
should
be
paid
the
money.
and
mr.
miller
was
paid
worker's
compensation.
he
received
because
he
was
off
work
29
weeks,
the
sum
of
$258
a
week.
after
he
returned
to
work,
he
was
awarded
another
type
of
ohio's
worker
compensation
and
that
is
called
a
disability
award
because
he
still
had
some
residual
disability.
and
so
he
received
another
16
weeks
of
worker's
compensation
at
the
rate
of
i
think
it
was
$83
a
week.
and
then
he
applied
for
this
award
that's
the
subject
of
the
case
here
today.
an
award
that
is
called
an
additional
award
where
there
is
a
safety
violation.
the
additional
award
is
provided
under
the
ohio
constitution.
i'll
discuss
the
history
of
it
with
you
in
a
moment.
but
so
that
you
understand,
our
constitution
says,
if
the
industrial
commission
determines
there
is
a
safety
violation
and
that
it
caused
the
accident,
the
industrial
commission
may
award
no
less
than
15
percent
of
what
had
been
paid
to
this
man
by
way
of
workers
compensation,
no
more
than
50
percent
of
what
has
been
paid
to
this
man
by
way
of
workers
compensation,
so
that
the
additional
award
is
i
think
tied
into
the
whole
worker's
compensation
program.
what
you
have
in
front
of
you
today
is
a
case
that
involves
as
a
minimum
to
this
claimant,
something
like
an
award
for
additional
compensation
of
$1328.
the
record
in
this
case
that
was
filed
in
this
court
cost
more
than
the
minimum
award.
,--
the
maximum
award
that
this
individual
may
receive
is
$4439.
and
that's
what
we're
involved
with.
now,
how
do
we
get
to
the
additional
award,
how
did
the
state
of
ohio
provide
for
it.
if
i
were
that
employee
working
in
ohio
in
1900
and
i
got
hurt
in
1900,
i
would
have
sued
goodyear
atomic
for
my
injury.
i
had
a
common
law
suit
is
what
it
amounted
to.
by
1921
ohio
changed
the
procedure.
and
ohio
wasn't
the
only
state
that
changed
that
procedure,
and
i
may
say
a
few
of
these
things
about
worker's
compensation
because
i
assume
that
you're
not
familiar,
and
there's
no
reason
for
you
to
be
familiar
with
worker's
compensation.
they're
state
matters
traditionally.
but
in
1912,
ohio
provided
by
its
constitution,
vote
of
the
people,
for
a
worker's
compensation
program.
they
were
much
like
many
other
states.
all
states
were
going
through
this
process
of
adopting
workers
compensation
programs.
so
that
there
was
created
a
state
industrial
board
and
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
pay
compensation
where
a
person
was
injured
because
everybody
recognized
the
old
system
didn't
work.
we
had
become
some
type
of
an
industrialized
society
by
then.
but
there
was
in
that
ohio
constitution
in
1912,
a
provision
which
retained
the
right
to
sue
at
common
law,
the
right
to
sue
that
employer
where
in
fact
the
injury
occurred
because
the
requirements
dealing
with
the
preservation
of
life
or
safety
had
not
been
met
by
the
employer.
so
here
i
am
in
1912.
i,
the
employee,
have
a
right
at
common
law
to
sue.
and
it
stayed
that
way
in
ohio
from
1912
until
1923
because
people
figured
out
by
1923
that
it
was
not
a
good
idea
to
permit
the
suit,
that
it
really
didn't
serve
the
purpose
intended
by
workers'
compensation.
and
in
1923,
our
constitution
was
amended,
and
it
is
that
amended
that
we're
considering
here
today.
because
in
1923,
the
right
of
the
worker
to
sue
was
taken
away,
and
it
was
replaced
by
this
additional
award
which
is
in
front
of
me
today.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
history
demonstrates
that
this
is
compensatory.
i
think
it
is
designed
by
the
state
to
pay
the
worker
who
is
injured.
i
think
in
fact
when
you
look
at
it,
you
come
to
recognize
that
the
state
has
provided
a
certain
amount
of
compensation
for
just
a
plain
injury.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
different
issue.
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
issue.
i
have
to
emphasize
of
course
and
i'm
certain
the
court
understands,
in
this
instance
the
safety
requirement
is
virtually
identical.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
there's
no
difference.
but
if
there
were
a
difference,
let's
assume
that
for
the
moment
which
is
your
question,
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference.
ohio,
in
fact,
is
saying,
you,
mr.
miller,
have
been
hurt
as
a
result
of
overlooking
this
particular
requirement.
if
in
fact
that's
so,
you're
going
to
be
paid
additional
compensation
because
we
look
to
this
situation
as
being
a
situation
of
some
culpability
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
now,
goodyear
atomic
in
that
situation,
same
assumption,
conflict
of
provisions,
goodyear
atomic
is
entitled
to
do
what
i
think
goodyear
atomic
was
entitled
to
do
anyway,
which
is
to
totally
disregard
if
it
so
chooses,
what
it
is
that
the
state
of
ohio
has
provided
by
way
of
a
safety
requirement.
what
triggers
anything
in
ohio
is
the
fact
that
there
has
been
an
injury.
goodyear
atomic--
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
--so
that
you
and
i
are
both
perfectly
clear,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
make
a
finding
on
whether
there
is
a
violation
or
not.
i
think
where
this
case
is
right
now
is
a
question
of
may
the
state
of
ohio
proceed
to
make
a
determination
that
there
has
been
a
violation,
and
if
in
fact,
it
so
finds,
may
it
then
award
additional
compensation.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
justice
scalia,
if
i
may,
i
think
what
you
need
to
find
is
that
congress
provided
by
40
u.s.c.
290
that
state
workers'
compensation
laws
are
applicable.
i
think
the
statute
is
very
clear.
i
think
it
is
a
situation
where
congress
has
spoken,
and
i
think
it
is
entitled
so
to
speak,
and
i
think
it
is
entitled
to
make
a
change.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
i
don't
think
it
raises
a
separate
question,
because
all
that
ohio
does,
if
it
determines
that
the
injury
is
due
to
the
safety
requirement
not
having
been
followed,
all
that
happens
is
that
compensation
is
paid
to
mr.
miller.
goodyear
might
choose
to
do
absolutely
nothing,
other
than
pay.
goodyear
may
decide
that
they
couldn't
care
less
that
this
particular
safety
requirement
of
ohio.
goodyear
may
never
again
have
to
pay
anything
because
no
one
is
ever
again
hurt
in
ohio.
goodyear
came
to
ohio,
goodyear
atomic
came
to
ohio
and
that
plant
opened
in
1953.
and
from
1953
through
1980,
with
these
thousands
of
pages
that
the
attorney
for
the
appellant
says
exist,
goodyear
was
never
called
on
to
pay
any
additional
compensation.
there
was
never
any
injury.
and
i
might
add
to
you,
there
are
not
thousands
of
pages,
either.
the
pages
for
the
factory
and
workshops
safety
provisions
in
ohio
number
some
approximate
230
pages.
they
are
not
all
those
volumes
that
were
exhibited
to
you.
this
is
actually
the
ohio
factory
and
workshop
provisions.
goodyear,
when
that
claim
was
filed,
goodyear
advised
the
state
of
ohio
that
it
followed
the
ohio
safety
requirements.
you
will
find
that
in
the
record
at
page
j-43,
is
the
response
of
goodyear.
they
have
followed
our
ohio
requirements.
apparently,
they
didn't
have
any
trouble
following
our
ohio
requirement.
and
so
there
we
are.
and
as
i
say,
i
look
at
this
case
and
say,
i
think,
it's
really
a
question
of
did
congress
permit
this.
it
seems
to
me
the
statute
is
clear.
and
i
have
to
disagree
with
some
of
the
comments
made
by
the
solicitor
general
as
to
the
history
of
that
particular
statute
and
as
to
its
significance.
and
i
think
it
all
goes
back
to
16
u.s.c.
457
when
congress
passed
457,
it
remitted
a
tort
action,
and
there
were
courts,
as
you
probably
understand,
who
felt
that
16
u.s.c.
457
applied
to
workers'
compensation.
until
this
court
decided
murray
v.
gerrick
&
co.,
and
kind
of
threw
up
in
the
air
the
question
of,
was
workers'
compensation
covered,
there
had
been
decisions
that
said
workers'
compensation
was
covered
under
457.
so
that
had
we
without
even
getting
to
290,
had
we
had
just
16
u.s.c.
457
which
applied
to
workers'
compensation,
mr.
miller
would
have
had
his
claim
covered,
as
permitted
by
congress.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
yes,
sir.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
it
refers
to
the
company
safety
department.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
no.
if
i
might
say,
not
only
was
the
ladder
inspected
by
the
company
safety
department,
you
will
find
in
there,
and
i
think
it's
at
ja-50,
a
report
from
the
union
safety
representative
who
also
inspected
that
particular
scaffold.
so
that
this
court
understands,
the
parties
entered
into
a
stipulation
of
fact,
if
there's
a
question,
for
example,
as
to
the
involvement
of
the
security
interests
of
the
united
states,
these
parties
entered
into
a
stipulation
of
fact
as
to
what
happened.
goodyear
provided
pictures
of
the
scaffold
so
that
the
state
of
ohio
could
see
what
the
scaffold
looked
like.
there
was
an
accommodation,
if
you
will,
of--
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
--no,
no
on
site
inspection.
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
to
some
extent
that
makes
it
difficult
for
the
claimant
to
establish
what
happened,
because
in
ohio,
the
burden
is
on
the
claimant
to
show
that
the
claimant
is
entitled
to
the
compensation.
nevertheless,
that's
the
claimant's
problem.
that's
not
in
front
of
you
today.
the
point
that
i
make
is
that
it
is
possible
and
in
fact
the
parties
did
make
accommodations
in
connection
with
this
matter.
by
the
time
the
case
got
to
the
industrial
commission,
the
department
of
energy
had
come
in,
they
raised
a
pre-emption
argument,
and
it
may
very
well
have
been
the
first
time
that
kind
of
an
argument
has
ever
been
raised
to
the
ohio
industrial
commission,
and
they
backed
off.
both
of
our
courts,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
supreme
court,
were
in
favor
of
granting
a
mandamus
or
that
the
industrial
commission
go
forward
and
make
a
determination
in
this
matter,
and
from
there,
your
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction,
and
we're
here
today.
if
you
look
at
it
in
terms
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me
that
290
was
and
is
written
about
as
broadly
as
a
statute
could
be
written.
and
you
can
almost
see
the
congressional
people
trying
to
write
it
in
such
a
fashion
that
should
this
court
come
to
grips
with
this
problem
again,
the
court
would
understand
that
the
intent
of
the
congress
is
to
permit
workers'
compensation
to
be
paid
as
the
state
would
provide.
and
the
language
they
use
is
in
the
same
way
and
the
same
extent.
and
they
have
started
out
in
such
a
fashion
that
it's
about
as
broadly
written
as
anything
could
be
when
they
say
whatsoever
authority
the
state
is
authorized
to
handle
workers'
compensation
has
the
authority
to
proceed
with
this
matter.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
no,
sir.
i
do
not
say
the
ohio
industrial
commission
has
power
to
regulate.
i
say
the
ohio
industrial
commission
has
power
to
pay
the
compensation
to
the
person
that
got
hurt.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
it
is
a
way
of
explaining
or
trying
to
explain
that
there
is
this
requirement.
it's
much
different,
justice
scalia,
then
let's
say
we
brought
a
suit,
and
we
argued
that
this
was
negligence
per
se
that
had
occurred
here,
because
there
is
a
state
statute
that
says
this
is
a
particular
requirement.
there
isn't
any
real
difference.
that's
exactly
the
same
situation
here.
the
state
has
tried
to
protect
the
work
place
safety
of
people,
and
they
have
tried
to
do
it
in
this
fashion,
and
all
that
happens
is,
with
this
particular
section
we're
talking
about
or
this
particular
safety
section,
it
has
provided
that
the
exposed
surfaces
are
not
supposed
to
have
any
sharp
edges,
burrs
or
protruding
parts.
which
is
virtually
the
same
as
the
osha
standard.
and
in
fact,
it
had
a
protruding
part
and
the
man
got
hurt.
and
when
the
union
representative
made
his
safety
inspection
some
six
or
seven
months
later,
the
protruding
part
was
still
there.
it
had
not
changed.
goodyear
had
not
done
anything
with
it,
and
they
didn't
have
to
do
anything
with
and
no
one
from
the
state
of
ohio
came
in
to
make
them
do
anything
with
it.
the
only
thing
the
state
said
was,
okay,
if
in
fact,
this
violating
is
here,
there's
going
to
be
some
money
paid
to
this
man.
one
of
the
things
the
solicitor
general
talks
about
in
his
brief
is
that
the
state
may
provide
for
compensation
but
they
can't
just
go
throwing
it
out.
we're
not
going
to
enrich
this
person,
we
can't
give
him
more
than
full
compensation.
and
i
don't
really
know
what
full
compensation
is,
but
if
you
look
to
what
ohio
does,
ohio
basically
gears
its
compensation
on
a
person's
salary.
it
has
a
limit
which
is
66
2/3rds
percent
of
the
individual's
salary.
it
also
has
a
limit
which
is
a
statewide
maximum
so
regardless
of
how
much
you
make,
you
cannot
receive
more
than
whatever
is
the
statewide
maximum.
if
in
terms
of
66
2/3rds
percent,
it's
based
on
wages,
there
is
no
provision
for
pain
and
suffering
that
the
individual
may
have
had,
there
is
no
provision
for
loss
of
consortium,
strictly
limited
to
wages.
now,
if
you
add
in
the
additional
compensation
which
is
this
award,
and
i've
tried
to
say
to
you,
this
is
all
one
package
of
workers'
compensation,
let's
say
you
add
in
the
maximum
of
50
percent
of
what
has
been
paid
in
workers'
compensation.
if
you
take
the
66,
and
you
take
50
percent
of
that,
the
state
is
going
to
award
another
33
percent,
bringing
you
up
to
roughly
100
percent
of
the
person's
wages.
that
the
state
of
ohio
has
considered
full
compensation.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
not
just
throwing
money
away
to
a
claimant
has
been
hurt,
it
is
a
legitimate
effort
of
the
state
to
pay
a
little
more
where
there
is
culpability
on
the
part
of
the
employer,
it
is
something
that
the
employees
of
the
state
have
given
up
by
way
of
their
giving
up
the
right
to
go
into
court
and
sue.
and
that
was
the
trade
off.
they
gave
up
the
right
to
go
into
court
and
sue
in
return
for
having
the
industrial
commission
make
the
particular
awards.
the
appellant
here,
and
the
solicitor
general,
would
agree
that
the
basic
compensation
may
appropriately
be
paid
under
290,
but
they
want
to
carve
out
the
additional
compensation.
nevertheless,
they
still
want
to
retain
the
right
of
not
being
sued
by
the
employee,
which
is
what
that
1923
amendment
provided.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
yes,
i
think
that
i
would
agree
to
that.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
yes.
there's
no
question
about
closing
down
the
plant,
and
very
frankly,
i
think
that's
the
key
element
with
the
hancock
case
and
it
involved
more,
as
i'm
sure
you
know,
more
than
just
an
aec
operation.
when
the
state
of
kentucky
decided
that
they
were
going
to
impose
a
permanent
requirement,
they
affected
the
army
in
kentucky,
the
affected
the
tva
in
kentucky
and
they
affected
the
aec
in
kentucky.
and
the
bottom
line
of
what
they
were
saying
was,
it
doesn't
matter.
let
me
go
back
one
second.
congress
provided
that
the
state
had
authority
under
the
clean
air
act
to
make
provisions
dealing
with
pollutants
of
the
air.
when
hancock
hit
this
court,
you
were
in
the
situation
of
looking
at
it
and
saying,
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
army,
the
tva,
and
the
aec
are
in
compliance
with
all
of
kentucky's
requirements
on
clean
air.
if
they
don't
get
the
permit,
they
will
be
shut
down.
and
basically
i
read
hancock
to
say
that...
i
don't
think
hancock
applies
to
our
situation
at
all...
i
read
hancock
to
say
that
there
is
no
way
any
state
may
shut
down
an
operation
of
the
federal
government.
and
i
hasten
to
add,
justice
stevens,
that
the
state
of
ohio
makes
no
moves
in
those
directions.
all
that
we
have
involved
here
today
is
we
pay
the
man
the
additional
money.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
there
is
nothing
paid
to
the
claimant,
number
one.
in
other
words,
congress
has
made
no
provision
for
any
kind
of
a
federal
remedy
for
violation
of
the
osha
regulations.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
they
have
authority
in
connection
with
the
radiological
aspects
to
provide
regulations.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
the
legislation
permits
them,
the
legislation
permits
them
to
adopt.
they
in
fact
proceeded
to
adopt
the
osha
regulations.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
yes,
as
to
non-radiological
aspects,
okay.
and
there
is
no
provision
under
osha
for
any
kind
of
a
remedy
to
the
person
who
is
hurt,
no
federal
remedy,
in
other
words.
and
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
where
the
federal
government
has
not
provided
for
a
remedy
to
the
person
who
is
injured
that
the
state
remedies
would
apply.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
well,
we
may
be
making
this
more
complicated,
justice
scalia,
than
we
need
to.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
and
very
frankly,
i
have
to
apologize,
i'm
not
certain
that
i
at
all
understand
the
distinction
that
you're
trying
to
make.
our
provisions
for
state
requirements
are
requirements
adopted
by
the
commission
or
requirements
adopted
by
our
state
legislature.
mr.
stewart
w.
jaffy
i
think
if
the
state
of
ohio
were
to
adopt
the
osha
regulations
as
part
of
their
safety
requirements,
what
you're
saying
is
100
percent
correct.
ohio
has
not
done
that.
i
might
say
unfortunately,
they
haven't
done
it,
but
they
haven't,
and
that's
the
status
of
where
we
are
today.
the
industrial
fabricators
case
which
is
in
the
appendix
which
was
a
federal
district
court
case
coming
out
of
our
southern
district
of
ohio,
involved
an
argument
which
in
some
ways
parallels
this
because
the
employer
there
was
arguing
that
the
additional
safety
award
should
not
be
paid
because
it
conflicted
with
osha.
the
federal
district
court
didn't
agree
with
that.
the
federal
district
court
indicated,
i
thought
very
clearly,
that
our
additional
compensation
is
a
compensation
matter,
primarily.
while
it
may
have
some
incidental
effects
in
terms
of
causing
an
employer,
if
you
will,
to
clean
up
his
act,
that's
not
the
primary
purpose
of
our
ohio
law.
and
i
think
that
case,
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
cases
that
have
been
cited,
indicate
this.
