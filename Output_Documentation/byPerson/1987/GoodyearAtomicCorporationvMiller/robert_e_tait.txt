mr.
robert
e.
tait
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
from
appellant's
perspective,
the
single
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
of
ohio
may
be
permitted
to
impose
its
safety
regulations
on
a
nuclear
production
facility
which
is
exclusively
owned
and
controlled
by
the
united
states
of
america,
and
essential
to
the
national
defense.
very
briefly
at
the
time
this
action
arose,
the
goodyear
atomic
corporation,
the
appellant
herein,
operated
a
nuclear
production
and
utilization
facility
located
near
portsmouth,
ohio,
under
contract
with
the
united
states
department
of
energy.
this
facility
is
one
of
only
two
of
its
type
in
the
united
states,
and
is
the
only
facility
in
america
capable
of
enriching
uranium
to
the
assays
needed
to
power
our
nuclear
ships
and
submarines.
because
of
the
critical
importance
of
this
particular
operation,
congress
has
mandated
that
the
department
of
energy
be
the
exclusive
owner
of
all
land,
buildings
and
equipment
associated
with
this
operation,
and
significantly
that
doe
establish
radiological
and
non-radiological
safety
regulations
with
which
its
contractor
operators
must
comply.
now,
as
noted
in
the
record,
the
operating
contract
under
which
goodyear
operated
the
facility
in
question
contained
a
specific
provision
implementing
that
requirement.
this
particular
case
arises
out
of
a
simple
workers'
compensation
claim
involving
a
former
goodyear
employee,
the
appellee,
esto
miller.
in
1980,
miller
fell
from
a
scaffolding
and
fractured
his
ankle.
he
was
paid
normal
workers'
compensation
benefits
and
subsequently
returned
to
work.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
there
is
no
question,
your
honor,
that
in
accordance
with
40
u.s.c.
290,
the
workers
compensation
benefits,
normal
workers
compensation
benefits
do
apply
to
the
operations
of
this
plant
and
to
goodyear
employees,
yes.
and
there
has
never
been
any
question,
nor
has
there
ever
been
any
dispute
as
far
as
i'm
aware
with
respect
to
those
type
of
benefits.
the
dispute
arose
in
this
case,
however,
because
in
addition
to
his
normal
workers'
compensation
benefits,
miller
sought
to
hold
goodyear
liable
for
an
additional
award,
allegedly
based
upon
their
violation
of
a
specific
safety
requirement
promulgated
by
the
state
of
ohio.
now,
when
he
filed
this
application,
the
administrative
body
charged
with
enforcing
these
requirements,
the
industrial
commission
of
ohio,
dismissed
the
application,
recognizing
their
belief
that
it
was
preempted
by
federal
law,
by
the
atomic
energy
act,
and
by
principles
of
federal
immunity.
,--
mr.
robert
e.
tait
--no,
there
was
not
a
great
deal
involved,
and
in
fact
there
has
never
been
a
great
deal
involved
with
respect
to
this
particular
claim
as
a
monetary
matter.
however,
through
a
mandamus
action
that
was
initiated
on
behalf
of
mr.
miller
both
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
reversed
the
administrative
determination
because
of
what
they
perceived
to
be
somehow
a
significant
distinction
between
radiological
and
non-radiological
hazards.
now,
what
is
clear
from
those
decisions
is
that
neither
of
the
ohio
courts
understood
the
issue
in
this
case.
they
first
and
foremost
refer
to
this
operation
as
a
power
plant.
it
is
not
a
power
plant.
they
completely
failed
to
recognize
the
fundamental
distinction
between
an
nrc
operated
power
plant
and
a
doe-owned
and
controlled
federal
nuclear
production
facility.
thirdly
and
most
importantly,
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
particular
failed
to
recognize
the
significance
of
the
federal
ownership
of
this
particular
facility.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
your
honor,
we
submit
that
it
makes
no
difference
whatsoever.
and
we
submit
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
case
of
hancock
v.
train
should
be
dispositive
of
this
case.
coincidentally,
the
hancock
decision
involved
the
sister
operation
to
the
portsmouth
facility.
that
involved
paducah,
kentucky.
now,
despite
the
fact
that
the
paducah
operation
does
not
have
the
same
national
defense
and
security
considerations
as
this
facility
does,
nevertheless,
this
court
in
the
hancock
decision
reiterated
the
basic
constitutional
doctrine
that
absent
express
congressional
authorization,
such
facilities
are
free
from
state
regulation.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
well,
your
honor,
the
penn
dairies
line
of
cases
which
are
raised
by
the
appellant
as
a
way
to
try
to
evade
the
hancock
immunity
in
this
case,
seems
to
me
to
involve
three
different
areas
of
inquiry.
first
of
all,
the
majority
of
those
cases
involved
contractors
that
were
providing
goods
and
services
to
the
federal
government
as
opposed
to
actually
involved
with
the
day
to
day
operation
of
a
federal
facility,
in
effect,
surrogate
government
employees.
secondly,
with
the
exception
of
the
new
mexico
tax
cases,
i'm
not
aware
that
any
of
those
matters
involved
a
nuclear
facility
or
facilities
that
had
any
national
defense
input.
thirdly,
and
perhaps
most
significantly,
however,
the
penn
dairies
line
of
cases
it
seems
to
me
creates
a
distinction
between
an
impact
upon
the
expense
or
cost
of
the
federal
operation
of
the
facility
as
opposed
to
the
day
to
day
conduct
of
that
facility.
and
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
question
would
become
the
extent
of
the
effect
of
the
action
on
the
operation
of
the
facility
itself.
i
suppose
if
you
have
an
action
where
an
employee,
for
instance,
is
in
the
parking
lot
of
the
facility
and
somehow
gets
run
over
by
a
forklift
operated
by
a
goodyear
employee,
then
there
is
perhaps
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
immunity
that
was
established
by
this
court
in
hancock
can
apply.
however,
in
this
particular
instance--
mr.
robert
e.
tait
--i
suppose
my
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
it
depends
on
the
particular
circumstance
how
far
the
federal
immunity
applies.
it
is
dependent
upon
the
affect
on
the
operation,
on
the
affect
of
the
federal
function.
if
in
fact
the
state
law--
mr.
robert
e.
tait
--if
in
fact
the
basis
behind
the
state
tort
action
is
contractor
operation
that
is
basically
in
compliance
with
how
the
federal
government
has
instructed
him
to
operate.
and
therefore
would
provide
some
sort
of
chilling
effect
on
how
he
operates
the
facility.
and
i
guess
our
position
would
be
that
the
immunity
would
apply
to
that
contract
because
it
would
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
federal
function.
in
this
particular
case,
however,
we
don't
have
that
difficult
a
situation
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
what
you
have
are
literally
thousands
of
pages
of
safety
requirements
promulgated
by
the
state
of
ohio,
enforced
by
an
agency
of
the
state
of
ohio
in
which
they
are
requiring
a
government
contractor
to
comply.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
well,
if
i
interpret
the
hancock
decision
correctly,
your
honor,
if
in
fact
there
is
specific
congressional
authorization
of
the
type
of
state
activity
that
is
attempted
to
be
imposed
on
the
facility,
then
that
expresses
the
federal
government's
congressional
intent
to
allow
that
type
of
application.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
possible.
if
you
have
a
client
who
is
willy
nilly
disregarding
safety
requirements,
it
seems
to
me
in
this
day
and
age,
that
the
first
thing
you're
going
to
have
is
tremendous
labor
difficulties
where
the
union
is
going
to
say
the
employer
is
not
encouraging
employee
safety.
in
fact,
the
employer
is
engaging
in
activities
that
fly
in
the
face
of
employee
safety.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
would
so
respond,
your
honor,
that's
small
solace
for
the
union,
nor
is
it
going
to
help
our
labor
difficulties
at
all.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
permissible,
your
honor,
but
again,
we
would
argue
that
first
of
all
that
was
certainly
something
that
was
not
contemplated
by
the
congress
when
they
passed
the
atomic
energy
act,
which
requires
exclusive
control.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
yes,
your
honor.
the
important
distinction
is
in
fact
that
the
safety
regulations
which
are
applied
to
this
plant
by
reason
of
the
atomic
energy
act
are
specifically
promulgated
by
the
department
of
energy.
these
safety
regulations
which
the
department
promulgates
are
applicable
to
these
facilities,
this
small
number
of
facilities.
congress
so
intended
in
the
atomic
energy
act.
osha
has
recognized
that
their
requirements
do
not
apply
to
these
facilities
by
reason
of
the
atomic
energy
act.
and
we
submit
that
if
you
have
such
a
recognition
by
another
entity
of
the
federal
government
that
certainly
the
state
of
ohio's
requirements--
mr.
robert
e.
tait
--absolutely.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
scaffolding
regulation.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
the
scaffolding
regulation
itself
is
not
inconsistent
with
any
federal
regulation.
they're
clearly
are
regulations
again
in
this
three
volumes
and
thousands
of
pages
of
regulations
that
are
inconsistent
with
department
of
energy
regulations,
and
with
which
this
operation,
as
i
understand
it,
simply
could
not
economically
comply.
but
the
point
i
believe,
your
honor,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
international
paper
and
in
garment
and
in
many
of
the
cases
is
that
where
you
have
an
effect,
in
effect
serving
two
masters,
that
it
creates
some
sort
of
chaotic
regulatory
scheme
and
invites
conflict.
and
even
if
we
were
to
leaf
through
these
entire
pages
of
regulations
and
point
out
this
regulation
being
in
conflict
having
to
do
it
on
a
case
by
case
basis
necessarily
negatively
impacts
on
the
way
this
operation
is
conducted.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
section
290,
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
i
may,
the
united
states
is
going
to
address
that
issue
more
completely
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
might.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
very
quickly,
i'm
having
a
little
bit
difficult
time
comprehending
where
mr.
jaffy's
coming
from
with
respect
to
first
of
all,
telling
this
court
he
agrees
i
assume
pursuant
to
the
hancock
doctrine,
ohio
would
not
have
the
authority
to
impose
fines
for
violation
of
a
specific
safety
requirement.
at
the
same
time
indicate
that
they
have
the
authority
to
order
an
employer
to
pay
compensation
to
an
employee.
clearly,
the
primary
basis
behind
the
specific
safety
requirements
promulgated
by
the
state
of
ohio
are
to
promote
safety.
no
one
questions
that
and
the
attorney
general
on
behalf
of
the
industrial
commission
concedes
that
fact,
that
the
primary
basis
of
those
requirements
are
to
promote
safety
through
regulation
of
employer
conduct.
now,
assuming
that
you
take
that
as
a
given,
and
i
don't
think
that
you
can
simply
ignore
the
practicalities
of
it--
mr.
robert
e.
tait
--mr.
justice,
i
believe
that
pursuant
to
hancock,
that
decision
is
placed
in
the
hands
of
congress.
hancock
says
that
where
you
have
a
federal
facility--
mr.
robert
e.
tait
--yes.
but
i
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
question,
and
i
assume
it's
the
answer
that
the
united
states
would
maintain
is
that
that
decision
whether
to
impose
for
violations--
mr.
robert
e.
tait
--of
federal
facilities,
or
for
violation
of
federal
safety
regulations
is
within
the
hands
of
congress.
mr.
robert
e.
tait
congress
has
given
the
department
of
energy,
and
the
department
of
energy
has
promulgated
its
own
regulations,
a
pervasive
scheme
and
a
pervasive
scheme
of
remedies.
