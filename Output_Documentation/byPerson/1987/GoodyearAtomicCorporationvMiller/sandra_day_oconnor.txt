well,
does
it
make
any
difference
that
the
federal
facility
is
being
operated
by
a
private
contractor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there
any
discussion
in
hancock
of
how
to
reconcile
that
with
penn
dairies?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
this
were
a
third
party
tort
action
under
state
law
not
involving
an
employee.
is
that
somehow
preempted
in
your
view
also?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
your
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
effective
of
a
state
tort
action
is
generally
in
a
sense
regulatory.
if
the
contractor
has
been
operating
negligently,
the
state
tort
action
will
cause
the
behavior
to
change.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
jaffy,
would
this
be
a
different
case
at
all
if
the
safety
standard
at
issue
for
the
additional
award
were
one
that
were
contrary
to
the
particular
applicable
safety
standard
adopted
by
doe?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
understand
that.
