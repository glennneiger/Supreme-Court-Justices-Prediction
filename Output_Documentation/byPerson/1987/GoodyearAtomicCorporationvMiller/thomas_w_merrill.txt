mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
initial
question
in
this
case
as
mr.
tait
has
discussed
is
whether
the
doctrine
of
hancock
v.
train
applies
to
a
state
that
seeks
to
enforce
its
specific
safety
regulations
at
nuclear--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--hancock
v.
train
involved
what
was
i
think
a
closer
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
whether
section
118
of
the
clean
air
act
constituted
specific
authorization
to
the
state
of
kentucky
to
regulate
a
federal
facility,
such
as
paducah
production
plant.
and
the
language
of
section
118
was
if
anything
much
more
of
a
clear
authorization
on
the
part
of
congress
permitting
state
regulation
than
section
290
is.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
emphasize
however
that
at
some
point,
you
have
to
draw
the
line
in
determining
what
a
workmen's
compensation
law
is.
the
relevant
language
of
section
290
simply
authorizes
states'
workmen's
compensation
laws
to
apply
on
federal
property
and
facilities.
the
appellees
in
this
case
have
conceded
that
a
new
provision
in
the
ohio
statute
added
in
1986
that
allows
the
ohio
industrial
commission
to
issue
mandatory
orders
to
employers
requiring
that
they
comply
with
specific
safety
regulations
could
not
be
applied
to
the
portsmouth
fuel
production
plant.
that
by
itself
suggests
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
state
has
labeled
something
a
workmen's
compensation
law
or
has
instructed
its
industrial
commission
to
enforce
the
law
is
not
enough.
you
have
to
ask
the
question
of
what
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
and
in
many
cases,
the
existing
legal
landscape
or
the
state
of
the
law
in
effect
at
the
time
that
the
congress
passes
a
statute
is
a
relevant
consideration
to
look
to
in
deciding
what
congress
must
have
meant.
but
we
would
submit
that
there
are
several
aspects
in
the
background
of
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
section
290,
which
strongly
suggest
that
congress
did
not
have
any
but
the
narrowest
purposes
in
mind
when
they
enacted
that
particular
statute.
first,
let
me
address
a
more
general
issue
which
is
raised
by
the
appellee's
reliance
on
another
federal
statute
and
which
i
think
is
also
relevant
in
understanding
section
290,
and
which
has
not
been
adequately
brought
out
in
this
case
because
the
issue
really
only
arose
when
the
appellees
filed
their
brief.
the
appellees
referred
to
a
statute
16
u.s.c.
457
as
being
relevant
to
this
case.
that
statute
authorizes
the
application
of
state
wrongful
death
and
personal
liability
law
on
property
which
is
subject
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
this
particular
statute
is
irrelevant,
utterly
irrelevant
to
this
particular
case
because
it
only
applies
in
federal
enclaves,
areas
that
are
subject
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
the
portsmouth
gasification
plant
is
not
a
federal
enclave.
when
the
atomic
energy
commission
purchased
the
site
in
1952,
it
did
not
take
the
necessary
steps
to
insure
that
the
property
would
be
subject
to
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction,
and
so
by
its
terms,
section
457
does
not
apply
to
the
portsmouth
plant.
more
fundamentally,
section
457
does
not
go
to
the
question
of
federal
immunities,
the
question
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case
and
presented
by
the
hancock
decision,
457
concerns
the
question
of
the
scope
of
state
territorial
jurisdiction
over
federal
property.
and
section
457
simply
says
that
any
objection
to
the
territorial
application
of
state
wrongful
death
and
tort
law
is
waived,
but
it
does
not
waive
any
federal
immunities.
for
example,
in
this
court's
recent
decision
in
westfall
v.
irving
arose
out
of
a
tort
allegedly
committed
at
an
army
depot
which
was
a
federal
enclave.
the
only
reason
state
tort
law
applied
in
westfall
at
all
was
because
of
section
457,
but
no
one
in
that
case
contended
that
section
457
constituted
a
waiver
of
any
immunity
that
the
federal
employees
had.
and
in
fact,
this
court
recognized
that
if
the
employees
were
conducting
a
discretionary
function,
they
would
be
immune
from
any
such
tort
action.
so
there's
a
distinction
between
territorial
jurisdiction
and
immunities,
and
section
457
only
addresses
the
former
claim.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
or
a
third
member
of
the
public
entered
the
property
and
was
tortiously
injured,
state
law
would
govern.
not
because
of
section
457
because
this
is
not
a
federal
enclave
but
simply
because
the
application
of
tort
law
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
not
constitute
a
regulation
of
the
facility
itself
would
not
trigger
the
hancock
type
federal
facilities
immunity.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
justice
rehnquist,
we
think
it's
a
more
difficult
question.
it
would
present
a
much
more
difficult
question
to
what
extent
the
application
of
ordinary
tort
principles
or
state
negligence
law
represents
a
regulation
of
a
federal
facility,
as
opposed
to
simply
a
regulation
of
a
private
dispute
between
two
parties
or
a
regulation
of
a
contractor's
relationships
to
its
employees.
in
some
situations,
we
think
that
it
would
be
in
effect
a
regulation
of
the
facility.
for
example,
if
the
predicate
for
the
action
was
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
allegedly
violated
a
specific
state
safety
regulation
and
that
was
constituted
per
se
negligence.
we
think
that
would
really
be
no
different
from
the
application
of
a
specific
safety
regulation
in
this
case.
but
those
difficulties
in
line
drawing
with
respect
to
tort
actions
aren't
really
presented
in
this
case,
because
here
you
have
a
specific
state
safety
regulation
which
is
clearly
regulatory
in
its
effect,
and
its
application,
we
think,
triggers
the
federal
facilities
immunity.
let
me
turn
then
to
section
290,
and
the
reasons
why
we
in
particular
think
that
section
290
should
not
be
read
as
authorizing
the
application
of
the
state
safety
regulations
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
problem
that
gave
rise
to
the
enactment
of
290
was
real
a
problem
very
much
like
that
addressed
by
section
457.
that
is,
it
was
a
question
of
territorial
jurisdiction,
and
specifically,
the
golden
gate
bridge
was
being
constructed
in
california,
and
both
ends
of
the
bridge,
private
contractors
had
to
perform
work
on
federal
enclaves.
and
this
court
had
recently
held
in
a
case
called
murray
v.
gerrick,
section
457
was
not
broad
enough
to
authorize
the
application
of
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
on
federal
enclaves.
and
because
of
that
decision,
a
number
of
insurance
carriers
were
resisting
the
payment
of
workmen's
compensation
claims
for
people
injured
in
the
construction
of
the
golden
gate
bridge.
so
the
immediate
problem
that
gave
rise
to
the
enactment
of
section
290
was
a
territorial
jurisdiction
problem,
it
was
not
a
federal
immunities
question.
to
be
sure,
section
2
is
drafted
more
broadly
than
section
457.
it
does
not
simply
apply
to
enclaves,
it
applies
to
all
federal
property.
but
given
that
there's
no
suggestion
in
the
history
that
congress
was
thinking
beyond
the
question
of
territorial
jurisdiction,
we
think
that
the
court
should
be
reluctant
to
construe
that
statute
as
in
effect
a
waiver
of
a
federal
facility
immunity,
such
as
the
type
recognized
in
the
hancock
case.
second,
there
is
a
specific
legislative
history
in
the
enactment
of
section
2980
that
addresses
the
question
of
state
safety
regulations.
the
version
of
section
20
that
initially
passed
the
house
provided
that
no
only
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
but
also
state
safety
and
insurance
laws
would
apply
to
federal
buildings
and
projects.
the
senate
amended
the
bill
by
deleting
this
particular
reference
to
state
safety
and
insurance
laws.
and
the
senate
report
specifically
observed
that
the
reason
for
the
deletion
was
that
these
provisions
were
objected
to
by
procurement
agencies
of
the
government
inasmuch
as
such
provisions
would
not
only
produce
conflicts
of
authority
between
state
and
federal
officers,
but
would
also
mark
a
wide
departure
from
the
well
established
principle
that
federal
officers
should
have
complete
charge
of
any
regulations
pertaining
to
federal
property.
the
house
then
acceded
to
the
senate's
amendment.
and
that
history,
we
suggest,
is
strongly
probative
of
the
fact
that
congress
had
no
intention
when
it
enacted
290
of
waiving
any
immunity
objection
to
the
application
of
state
safety
regulations
to
federal
facilities.
finally,
as
if
to
underscore
the
narrowness
of
290,
congress
added
a
proviso
to
the
statute
expressly
reaffirming,
"by
the
passage
of
this
section,
the
united
states
of
america
in
no
wise
relinquishes
its
jurisdiction
for
any
purpose
over
the
property
named,
with
the
exception
of
extending
to
the
several
states
within
whose
exterior
boundaries
such
place
may
be,
only
the
powers
above
enumerated
relating
to
the
enforcement
of
their
state
workmen's
compensation
laws.
"
now,
again,
this
does
not
define
what
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
means,
but
it
does
strongly
suggest,
we
think,
that
congress
did
not
intend
section
290
to
be
used
as
a
vehicle
for
enhancing
state
regulatory
control
over
federal
property.
putting
together
the
background
of
section
290,
the
text
and
the
legislative
history,
we
think
that
as
a
matter
or
ordinary
statutory
construction
the
correct
conclusion
to
draw
would
be
that
that
statute
does
not
authorize
the
application
of
anything
more
than
traditional
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
to
federal
facilities.
however,
this
court's
decision
in
hancock
requires
even
more.
as
stated
in
the
companion
case
of
epa
v.
water
resources
board,
federal
facilities
are
subject
to
state
regulation
only
when
and
to
the
extent
that
congressional
authorization
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
and
whatever
can
be
said
about
section
290
as
a
matter
of
ordinary
statutory
construction,
we
think
it's
plain
that
it
can't
pass
this
more
exacting
standard.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
