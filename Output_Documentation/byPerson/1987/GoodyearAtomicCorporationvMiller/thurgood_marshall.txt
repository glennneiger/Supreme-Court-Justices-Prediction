marshall
this
case,
goodyear
atomic
corporation
versus
miller,
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
ohio
and
it
involves
ohio
workmen's
compensation
law
which
provides
at
an
additional
award
for
injuries
resulting
from
a
violation
of
a
state
safety
regulation
may
be
considered.
we
hold
that
because
the
federal
law
provides
clear
authorization.
the
supremacy
clause
does
not
bar
this
application,
this
provision
of
the
ohio
law
to
the
federal
facilities.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
is
affirmed.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
o'connor
has
joined.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
