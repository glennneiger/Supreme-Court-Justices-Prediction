justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
rely
on
the
labor
situation,
would
it
not
be
possible
independently
of
a
state
requirement
for
the
labor
union
to
negotiate
a
contract
which
contained
a
provision
that
the
employer
would
agree
to
abide
by
state
regulations
even
though
not
compelled
by
state
law
to
do
so.
that
i
suppose
would
be
permissible
under--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
merrill,
may
i
just
ask
in
that
connection,
supposing
there
were
a
suit
by
one
employee
against
another
arising
out
of
some
charge
of
negligence
in
the
plant.
that
could
be
decided
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jaffy,
you
referred
us
to
the
letter
of
goodyear
about
this
incident
as
the
joint
appendix
at
43.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
letter
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
scaffold
had
been
inspected
by
the
safety
department
and
found
to
be
in
satisfactory
condition.
do
you
know
whether
that
refers
to
the
ohio
safety
department
or
the
company
safety
department?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
they
were
not
routinely
inspected
by
the
ohio
safety
inspectors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jaffy,
can
i
just
clear
up
a
couple
of
things
in
my
own
mind.
would
you
agree
that
ohio
could
not
impose
a
penalty
payable
to
the
state
for
a
safety
violation
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
to
that
extent,
the
regulations
are
preempted.
and
they
also
could
not
close
down
the
plant,
or
deny
them
the
opportunity
to
operate
as
they
did
in
the
hancock
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
you
showed
us
the
size
of
the
regulations.
i
imagine
the
federal
regulations
are
probably
just
about
as
big,
i
don't
know.
but
what
is
the
sanction
for
violating
the
federal
regulation
of
this
kind?
what
remedy
is
the
federal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
osha,
but
there's
special
regulations,
not
osha
regulations,
but
regulations
related
to
this
particular
plant
as
i
understood
it,
or
at
least
to
nuclear
facilities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
don't
they
also
provide
safety
regulations
for
the
non-radiological
aspects
of
the
operation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see,
the
osha
regulations
do
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
tait,
what
about
justice
scalia's
question.
supposing
ohio
changed
its
statute
and
said
that
you
get
the
extra
money
if
you
violate
either
a
state
law
or
if
it's
been
preempted,
a
federal
regulation
that
is
applicable
to
that
facility.
that
would
be
permissible,
wouldn't
it?
and
if
that's
the
case,
you're
not
fighting
about
much
because
the
legislature
of
ohio
car
correct
it
very
promptly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
my
question
is
what
if
the
ohio
legislature
passes
such
a
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
now
congress
has
said
there
shall
be
no
remedy
for
such
a
violation?
