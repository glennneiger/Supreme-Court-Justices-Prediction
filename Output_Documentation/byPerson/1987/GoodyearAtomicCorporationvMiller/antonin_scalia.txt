justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tait,
to
add
on
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
what
if
there
was
a
federal
statute
that
said
state
tort
law
shall
apply,
notwithstanding
otherwise
applicable
federal
immunity.
then
would
you
still
have
to
say
it
depends
on
the
circumstances?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
here
we
don't
have
a
statute
that
says
state
tort
law
shall
apply.
we
have
a
statute
that
says
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
at
the
time
that
statute
was
enacted,
as
i
understand
it,
what,
one-seventh
of
the
states'
workmen's
compensation
laws
had
a
provision
like
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
they
regulate
the
activity
rather
than
they're
just
monetary.
well,
in
a
way,
they
just
increase
the
cost
to
the
government,
and
i'm
not
sure
that's
a
valid
way
to
distinguish
the
cases
that
respondent's
come
up
with.
your
client
can
just
roll
along
and
pay
more
money
in
workmen's
compensation,
i
presume,
and
disregard
the
state
requirements,
couldn't
it?
you're
only
talking
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
response
would
be
that
the
supreme
court
didn't
say
we
have
to
obey
these
state
rules.
the
supreme
court
only
said
that
we
have
to
pay
the
workmen's
compensation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
also
suggest
that
one-seventh
of
the
states
didn't
have
that
kind
of
a
provision
at
the
time
this
adoption
of
the
workmen's
compensation
law
was
enacted
by
the
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
has
to
be
a
violation,
too,
mr.
jaffy,
and
that's
what
i'm
a
little
bit
hung
up
on.
i
have
no
problem
in
light
of
section
290
of
applying
the
workmen's
compensation
law
by
its
terms.
the
trouble
is
that
the
ohio
workmen's
compensation
law
does
not
apply
and
does
not
provide
the
added
amount
unless
the
employer
is
within
the
terms
of
the
compensation
law,
in
violation
of
a
safety
rule
of
the
industrial
commission.
so
to
find
that
this
employer
is
within
that
provision
of
the
compensation
law,
i
also
have
to
find
that
the
employer
was
violating
a
safety
rule
of
ohio,
which
means,
it
seems
to
me,
i
have
to
find
that
he
was
subject
to
the
safety
rule
of
ohio.
isn't
that
what
the
statute
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
don't
we
also
have
to
find
that
this
employer
can
be
in
violation
of
ohio's
regulatory
laws,
or
can
we
let
ohio
say
he's
in
violation,
when
he
isn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
willing
to
say
they
are
applicable,
but
they
only
apply
if
he
is
in
violation
of
the
state
law.
that's
all
congress
said.
you
can
apply
them
but
you
have
to
apply
them
by
their
terms.
this
one
says
he
has
to
be
in
violation
of
ohio
law.
that
raises
a
totally
separate
question
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
workmen's
compensation
law.
is
this
employer
in
violation
of
the
ohio
safety
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jaffy,
i
think
what
the
government's
position
would
be
is
that
in
the
same
manner
and
in
the
same
extent
simply
means
this,
that
where
a
person
is
not
in
violation
of
a
state
regulation,
he
should
not
be
assessed
the
surcharge.
and
they
claim
that
this
particular
contractor
is
not
within
the
meaning
of
the
ohio
workmen's
compensation
law,
in
violation
of
any
state
regulation,
because
those
state
regulations
do
not
apply.
now,
are
you
maintaining
the
position
that
the
regulations
are
applicable,
that
the
ohio
authority
has
power
to
regulate
plant?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
only
payable
if
the
person's
in
violation
of
a
regulation.
that's
the
way
the
compensation
law
reads.
justice
antonin
scalia
we'd
have
no
problem
here
of
course,
and
i
assume
the
government
would
concede
the
case...
i
assume
the
government
would...
if
the
ohio
provision
read
that
this
surcharge
is
applicable
if
someone
violates
a
specific
safety
rule
of
the
industrial
commission
or
of
any
other
governmental
entity
which
may
have
jurisdiction.
presumably,
ohio
could
do
that,
and
if
it
read
that
way,
i
guess
the
government
would
agree
with
you
that
the
surcharge
is
chargeable,
which
means
ohio
would
look
to
see
whether
there
had
been
a
violation
of
osha
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
tend
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
i
think
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
this
thing
sort
of
falls
between
the
cracks,
that
is
to
say,
if
it
didn't
violate
the
ohio
provision,
but
did
violate
osha,
surely
there
ought
to
be
a
surcharge
applicable.
and
i
assume
ohio
could
write
it
that
way.
it
could
say,
if
you
violate
our
standards
or
the
standards
of
any
other
governmental
entity
that's
applicable,
we're
going
to
hit
you
with
a
15
percent
or
whatever
surcharge.
