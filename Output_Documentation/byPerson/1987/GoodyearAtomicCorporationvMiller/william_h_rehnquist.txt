chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
86-1172,
goodyear
atomic
corporation
versus
esto
miller
and
the
industrial
commission
of
ohio.
mr.
tait,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
there's
no
doubt
here,
mr.
tait,
that
the
regular
incidence
of
ohio
unemployment
compensation
law
apply
to
the
goodyear
atomic
plant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tait.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
merrill.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
hancock
v.
train
involve
anything
like
section
290
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
we
affirm
the
judgment
here,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
we're
authorizing
blanket
regulation
of
these
facilities
by
the
state
of
ohio.
we're
simply
saying
the
state
of
ohio
can
impose
a
workmen's
compensation
judgment
one
half
times
again
because
of
violation
of
its
safety
regulations.
we
know
that
it
can
impose
the
initial
workmen's
compensation
award
by
290.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
might
also
suggest
that
circumstances
alter
cases.
we
don't
have
that
case
before
us,
we
have
this
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
a
member
of
the
public
slips
and
falls
as
he
comes
in
and
says
it
was
just
unsafely
maintained.
now,
that
certainly
has
something
to
do
with
how
the
place
is
kept
up
in
justice
steven's
hypothesis.
and
your
answer
is
still
the
same,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
merrill.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
jaffy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
on
site
inspection
of
the
plant
by
the
workmen's
compensation
people?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jaffy,
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
tait,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tait.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-1172,
goodyear
atomic
corporation
against
miller
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
