--well,
mr.
tait,
isn't
there
a
code
of
safety,
a
federal
code,
that
your
client
has
to
abide
by?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
question
is
what
congress
intended.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
there
was
some
real
conflict
between
a
state
regulation
and
this
federal
code,
i
suppose
the
federal
code
would
be
supreme.
but
this
regulation
that
was
violated
here,
state
regulation,--
justice
byron
r.
white
--scaffolding
regulation,
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
any
provision--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
take
it
you
say
that
absent
this
permission
to
apply
the
state
workmen's
compensation
act,
it
would
be
clear
that
the
state
could
not
regulate
anything
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
this
provision
of
with
respect
to
the
workmen's
compensation
act
wouldn't
really
change
that.
