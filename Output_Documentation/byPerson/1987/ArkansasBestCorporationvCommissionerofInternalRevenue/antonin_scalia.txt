justice
scalia
mr.
horowitz,
you
explain
the
revenue
rulings
that
seem
to
have
accepted
the
what
we'll
call
bad
corn
products,
as
opposed
to
good
corn
products,
your
narrower
reading
of
it.
you
explain
them
as
simply
bowing
to
the
inevitable
in
order
to
give
guidance
to
the
taxpayers.
can
you
give
any
examples
of
the
revenue
service
asserting
in
the
past
the
position
that
you
are
now
giving
us?
you
explain
away
its
apparent
acceptance
of
corn
products.
can
you
give
us
any
examples
of
its
rejection
of
a
broad
reading
of
corn
products?
justice
scalia
when
was
that?
how
long
ago?
justice
scalia
but
if
we
do
what
you
say,
we're
just
not
going
to
affect
just
stock.
you
are
asking
us
to
kill
the
bad
corn
products,
and
that
has
application
in
a
lot
of
other
areas,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
what
other
areas?
you
say
stock
has
been
the
main
focus?
justice
scalia
and
the
devil
made
you
do
it.
justice
scalia
those
were
quieter
days,
1955.
what
was
considered
departing
from
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
was
apparently
relatively
little.
justice
scalia
unfortunately
for
your
case,
it
is
subsequent
to
1955.
none
of
them
is
subsequent
to
corn
products,
is
it?
justice
scalia
no,
but
if
congress
had
adopted
one
of
these
exceptions
after
corn
products,
you
could
argue
that
evidently
congress
didn't
think
that
corn
products
said
what
your
opponent
claims
it
says
because
then
the
new
exception
would
have
been
unnecessary.
all
of
these
exceptions
are
pre-1955.
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
undermine
that
part
of
your
argument,
but
it
does
not
enable
you
to
use
any
of
the
exceptions
for
the
proposition
that
congress
has
not
acquiesced
in
effect,
in
corn
products,
seen
it
and
said
it
was
good.
justice
scalia
why
do
they
make
all
those
exceptions
then,
if
all
of
those
exceptions
would
automatically
be--
justice
scalia
--that's
fine,
but
then
why
do
they
have
to
say,
except,
it
does
not
include
one,
two,
three
four,
and
some
of
those
exceptions
are
not
'55,
but
the
latest
was
what,
'54.
justice
scalia
it's
not
that
it
could
have
been
done
a
different
way.
i
cannot
understand
why
you
say
something,
if
it
is
used
in
business,
is
automatically
not
included
but
then
go
on
to
say
by
the
way,
these
things
that
are
used
in
business
are
not
included.
