mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit,
which
denied
arkansas
best
corporation
an
ordinary
loss
treatment
on
the
sale
of
national
bank
of
commerce
stock
it
had
purchased
after
1972,
stock
that,
as
the
tax
court
expressly
found,
arkansas
best
purchased
solely
for
business
purposes.
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
is
in
direct
conflict
with
a
number
of
other
decisions
of
the
circuit
court,
court
of
claims,
tax
court,
and,
indeed,
is
inconsistent
with
past
decisions
of
this
court
as
well.
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion
challenges
the
fundamental
premise
of
what
is
known
in
the
tax
world
as
the
corn
products
doctrine.
that
is,
that
it
is
the
purpose
for
which
an
asset
is
purchased,
and
not
the
nature
of
the
asset,
that
determines
whether
it
is
a
capital
asset
or
a
non-capital
asset.
in
doing
so,
it
presents
a
rather
fundamental
question
of
the
entire
application
of
the
tax
law.
the
question
of
whether
taxpayers
can
rely
on
the
words
of
this
court,
the
rulings
of
the
internal
revenue
service,
the
words
of
the
congressional
committees
interpreting
what
the
state
of
present
law
is,
and
numerous
other
courts
which
also
have
interpreted
the
language
of
this
court.
consistency
has
long
been
a
cornerstone
of
our
tax
system.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
no,
justice
blackmun.
i
don't
believe
i
could
say
that.
but
i
do
believe
that
the
application
of
the
tax
law,
and
consistency
in
the
application
of
the
tax
law
has
been
a
desideratum
that
has
been
announced
both
by
scholars
and
by
this
court
and
by
other
courts.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
it
was
reviewed
by
the
full
court.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
it
was
a
regular
tax
court
decision,
as
contrasted
with
a
memo
decision.
it
was
a
regular
decision.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
my
understanding,
justice
blackmun,
is
that
it
is
not
a
memo
decision.
it
is
reviewed
by
the
rest
of
the
court.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
the
corn
products
decision
actually
was
a
development
in
a
much
older
line
of
thinking
on
the
nature
of
a
capital
gain.
you
go
back
to
the
1932
and
the
opinion
of
justice
stone,
in
burnet
v.
harmel,
and
there
was
interpretation
of
the
1921
act,
as
modified
in
1924.
the
1921
act,
congress
decided
that
sales
of
what
had
been
denominated
as
capital
assets
would
be
treated
differently
than
the
sales
of
other
assets,
and
in
defining
what
a
capital
asset
was,
assets
acquired
and
held
by
the
taxpayer
for
profit
and
investment,
were
to
be
treated
as
capital
assets,
for
profit
and
investment,
and
taxed
at
preferential
rates.
in
1924,
that
language
was
modified
so
that
it
would
become
clear
at
that
point
that
a
taxpayer's
personal
assets
could
have
the
same
treatment.
but
business
assets
continued
to
be
treated
as
in
the
1921
act,
and,
indeed,
in
burnet
v.
harmel,
the
supreme
court
said
that
there
had
been
no
material
change
when
the
1924
act
modified
the
1921
act.
consistent
with
this
purpose,
in
1936
then,
the
treasury,
in
gmc
17322,
determined
that
hedging
transactions
really
were,
in
essence,
insurance,
and
that
they
would
be
treated,
when
they
were
entered
into
for
protecting
a
taxpayer's
manufacturing
process,
they
would
be
treated
as
ordinary
assets.
that
ruling
was
very
clear
to
announce
that
hedging
transactions
of
a
speculator
would
be
treated
as
a
capital
asset.
therefore,
you
have
the
situation
that
the
same
transaction,
precisely
the
same
transaction,
had
either
capital
or
ordinary
treatment,
depending
on
the
motive,
depending
on
the
motive
of
the
person
engaging
in
the
transaction.
this
was
consistent
with
what
the
supreme
court
had
decided
in
burnet
v.
harmel,
and
of
course
was
the
prelude
to
the
court's
decision
in
corn
products.
in
the
opinion
authored
by
justice
clarke,
the
question
was
whether
corn
products
corporation,
which
used
corn
products
in
various
manufacturing
operations,
would,
by
reason
of
hedging
transactions,
realize
a
capital
or
an
ordinary
gain.
in
that
case,
as
the
court
will
recall,
the
taxpayer
had
entered
into
the
hedging
transactions
in
order
to
protect
itself
from
price
increases
in
corn.
if
the
price
of
corn
escalated,
there
was
protection.
that
was
not
a
true
hedge.
and
so,
technically,
it
was
not
under
the
1935
gcm.
but
the
court
said
that
didn't
matter,
that
the
transaction
was
one
of
a
prudent
manufacturer,
not
one
of
an
investor,
not
a
transaction
entered
into
with
an
investment
or
profit
motive,
if
you
will,
but
one
directly
related
to
the
taxpayer's
business.
in
1958,
then,
the
internal
revenue
service
issued
another
ruling,
the
three
examples,
revenue
ruling
58-40,
where
it
rules
that
stocks,
bonds,
or
other
securities
that
were
purchased
solely
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
inventory,
or
for
other
business
purposes...
for
example,
the
government
securities
that
were
purchased
in
order
for
a
bonding
requirement
to
be
met...
would
give
rise
to
ordinary
treatment,
not
to
capital
treatment.
and
at
this
point
it
is
clear
that
revenue
ruling
58-40
is
in
direct
conflict
with
what
the
service,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
is
urging
on
this
court
today,
and
is
in
direct
conflict
with
what
the
eighth
circuit
determined
in
this
case.
since
the
decision
in
corn
products,
a
quick
noting
of
the
cch
citator
indicates
that
it
has
been
cited
more
than
260
times.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
corn
products
decision.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
i
believe
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
i
am
certain
that
it
was
cited
either
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
or
in
our
brief.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
it's
in
the
reply
brief.
in
your
reply
brief.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
in
the
reply
brief.
the
revenue
ruling,
again,
clearly
indicates
that
stock
can
be
an
ordinary
asset
if
the
principal
purpose,
if
the
principal
purpose
had
to
do
with
the
business
of
the
taxpayer.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor?
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
i
think
that
in
terms
of
where
it
fitted
on
the
balance
sheet,
that
that
would
inevitably
be
true.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
might
very
well
have
been
here
today
discussing
the
propriety
of
that
treatment.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
it
would
be
if
it
followed
its
rulings.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
as
in
corn
products,
or
as
in
revenue
ruling
58-40
or
as
in
revenue
ruling
75-13.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
and
of
course,
the
internal
revenue
service
did
prevail
in
the
mansfield
journal
case,
where
it
was
exactly
the
reverse
of
the
situation.
they
had
contracts.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
for
two
or
three
reasons.
you
will
notice
that,
both
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
the
brief,
of
both
parties,
the
importance,
the
continuing
importance
was
indicated
to
this
court,
indeed,
that
being,
for
asking,
for
at
least
two
reasons.
when
the
capital
gains
system
was
set
up,
it
was
not
solely
a
benefit
to
taxpayers.
capital
losses
are
offset
only
against
capital
gains.
and
indeed,
if
the
capital
loss
can
be
taken
only
against
a
capital
gain,
there
is
no
help.
that
system
is
left
in
place.
that
will
be
in
place
next
year
when
we
have
a
28
percent
tax
rate.
and
so
taxpayers
will
have
the
detriment
of
the
capital
loss
situation.
my
understanding
is
that
this
was
considered
in
the
1930s,
in
the
early
1930s,
when
there
was
some
thought
of
elimination
of
capital
gains,
and
it
was
thought
that
the
revenue,
because
of
the
stock
market
crash,
the
federal
revenues
could
not
stand
the
loss
of
revenue
which
would
be
incident
to
allowing
capital
losses
against...
what
had
been
capital
losses...
against
ordinary
income.
and
of
course,
at
any
time
of
a
stock
market
decline,
that
would
be
true.
the
second
reason
i
would
say
so,
the
committee
reports
relating
to
the
1986
act
specifically
left
the
capital
gains
system
in
place,
because
congress
was
not
clear
whether
it
could
maintain
the
28
percent
rate.
and
if
the
28
percent
rate
changed,
then
indeed
there
should
be
some
kind
of
modification.
the
situation
is
not
just
that
the
courts
have
followed
corn
products
and
have
developed
the
reasoning
of
the
profit
motive,
the
importance
of
the
profit
motive,
a
dominant
business
motive,
as
contrasted
with
a
profit
motive
being
the
distinction.
the
congress
has
followed
that
approach.
in
1975,
treasury
suggested
to
congress
that
all
capital
stock
be
treated
as
capital
assets.
and
had
that
been
enacted,
of
course,
this
taxpayer
would
not
have
had
a
basis
for
bringing
this
case.
both
houses
of
congress
considered
treasury's
proposal.
both
houses
of
congress
rejected
the
treasury
proposals.
they
enacted,
each
house
enacted
instead
a
provision
that
said
that
30
days
after
the
purchase
of
stock,
that
a
taxpayer
would
have
to
market
as
either
a
business
asset
or
as
a
capital
asset.
however,
it
was
in
the
last
days
of
the
session.
and
so,
at
that
time,
they
never
had
a
conference
committee
on
it
and
congress
never
went
back
to
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
legislation,
or
never
made
a
decision
saying
that
all
stock
would
be
capital
assets.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
no,
chief
justice,
it
did
not.
a
type
of
30-day
proposal
passed
each
house.
but
there
was
never
a
conference
of
the
senate
and
the
house.
and
so
it
never
became
law.
the
treasury
proposal
is
essentially
what
the
eighth
circuit
said.
the
eighth
circuit,
in
essence,
said
capital
stock
is
always
a
capital
asset
unless
of
course
it
is
held
by
a
trader.
you
can
have
a
trader
who
has
stock
as
inventory,
and
that
is
clear
from
the
law.
but
it
is
also
clear
from
the
law
that
congress,
in
the
committee
reports,
talked
about
what
the
present
state
of
the
law
is.
as
is
always
true
in
congressional
hearings,
there
will
be
a
committee
report.
there
was
a
house
report,
and
there
was
a
senate
report.
and
it
said,
under
present
law,
the
treatment
of
gain
or
loss
on
sale
or
exchange
of
stock
or
other
security
depends
on
whether
the
security
is
a
capital
asset
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer.
it
seems
absolutely
clear
that
congress
understood
the
law.
then
it
says,
if
stock
or
security
is
held
for
business
purposes,
generally
it
would
not
be
treated
as
a
capital
asset,
and
therefore,
any
gain
would
be
treated
as
ordinary
income
and
any
losses
would
be
treated
as
ordinary
losses,
which
could
be
deducted
in
full
in
the
current
year.
that
is
our
fact
situation
here.
this
taxpayer
had
a
bear
by
the
tail,
in
a
manner
of
speaking.
it
had
to
divest
itself
of
the
stock.
congress
passed
the
one
bank
holding
company
act.
and
either
the
taxpayer,
which
owned
a
trucking
company,
a
furniture
manufacturer,
a
tire
sales
company,
a
retreading
company,
a
computer
company,
and
then
it
had
the
interest
in
the
bank,
which
it
had
acquired
in
1968,
it
could
expand
no
further
in
its
other
businesses
unless
it
divested
itself
of
the
stock,
because
of
the
bank
holding
company,
which
became
effective
december
31,
1971,
that's
right.
and
then
in
1971,
in
august,
this
taxpayer
filed
with
the
federal
reserve
a
statement
that
it
would
divest
of
its
stock.
so
it
is
clear
that
the
taxpayer
had
no
interest
in
acquiring
more
stock.
indeed,
it
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
stock
it
had.
as
the
tax
court
found,
the
stock
that
it
bought,
after
1972,
was
solely...
and
i
reiterate
the
word
"solely"...
for
the
protection
of
its
reputation,
for
its
business
purposes,
because
by
that
time,
it
was
clear
that
the
bank
was
in
financial
trouble,
and
that
the
taxpayer
was
going
to
have
trouble
selling
the
stock
it
already
had,
much
less
any
other
stock
that
it
purchased.
the
fact
that
the
taxpayer
sold
the
stock
solely
for
business
purposes
then
accords
with
what
had
been
the
traditional
rules
as
set
forth
in
this
court.
first,
you
take
a
look
at
the
burnet
v.
harmel,
then
corn
products,
then
p.g.
lake.
the
eighth
circuit
was
very
concerned
about
where
in
the
statute
you
found
the
definition
of
a
capital
asset
and
an
exclusion
that
would
fit
this
particular
situation,
or
fit
any
capital
stock
situation.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
justice
white,
i
am
down
to
it.
the
question
of
the
literal
exception,
like
justice
clark
said
in
corn
products,
those
futures
contracts
are
not
within
any
of
the
exceptions.
you
could
stretch
and
say
that
it
was
held
primarily
for
sale
to
customers
in
this
case,
because
we
had
to
sell
it.
we
had
already
agreed
to.
but
that
is
not
within
the
traditional
meaning
of
"held
primarily
for
sale
to
customers.
"
because
we
were
going
to
sell
the
stock
to
whoever
we
could
sell
it
to,
because
we
had
to.
we
couldn't
expand
any
further.
we
had
agreed
to
sell
the
stock.
so
we
had
no
choice.
however,
we
had
the
situation
where
if
we
didn't
pour
more
money
into
the
bank,
the
regulators
were
threatening
to
close
it.
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
real
estate
depression
in
dallas...
i
should
say
the
first
real
estate
depression,
because
we
are
in
another
one
right
now...
but
the
first
big
real
estate
depression
that
followed
the
tightening
of
money
in
the
early
days
of
president
nixon's
administration.
so
every
indication
was
that
things
were
getting
worse
and
worse.
texas
commerce
bank
had
agreed
to
buy,
or
at
least
we
thought
they
had
agreed
to
buy
the
bank.
in
1971
they
started
doing
their
due
diligence
and
they
found
a
lot
of
bad
loans.
as
we
moved
on,
we
found
a
lot
more
bad
loans.
and
so
the
regulators
came
in.
the
texas
commerce
bank
pulled
out
the
bank
examiners.
we
were
put
on
the
problem
bank
list,
and
they
said
you
had
to
raise
more
money.
of
course,
we
didn't
have
to
buy
the
stock.
we
could
have
walked
away.
but
a
holding
company
that
had
just
gone
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
that
planned
to
be
raising
money
through
stock
sales,
that
planned
to
be
borrowing
money
in
its
various
operations,
would
have
been...
well,
it
would
have
been
very
courageous,
if
not
foolhardy,
had
it
backed
off
at
that
point
and
not
bought
stock.
and
of
course,
that
is
what
the
tax
court
found,
that
at
that
point
it
bought
the
stock,
but
it
didn't
buy
the
stock
as
an
investment.
it
bought
stock
as
required
by
the
regulators,
solely,
solely
for
its
business
purposes.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
justice
white,
that
is
what
the
government
says.
but
that
is
not
what
this
court
said
in
corn
products,
because
a
futures
contract
is
clearly
not
inventory.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
the
argument
is
based,
really,
on
the
1921
act,
yes,
justice
white,
the
same
way
that
the
court
held
in
burnet
v.
harmel,
and
p.g.
lake.
those
were
clearly
sales
of
properties.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
certainly,
justice
o'connor,
that
is
a
concept
not
unknown
in
the
law,
but
there
was
a
specific
finding
here,
unchallenged
by
the
eighth
circuit,
unchallenged
by
the
government,
that
the
purchase
after
1972
was
not
to
preserve
another
asset.
it
was
solely,
solely
to
preserve
a
reputation.
and
expenditures
for
good
will
have
been,
and
in
my
judgment
and
hope
should
continue
to
be,
fully
deductible.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
retain
the
rest
of
the
time
for
rebuttal,
please.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
corn
products
itself,
justice
clarke's
language
was:
"admittedly,
petitioner's
corn
futures
do
not
come
within
the
literal
language
of
the
exclusions
set
out
in
that
section.
"
"they
were
not
stock
in
trade,
actual
inventory,
property
held
for
sale
to
customers
or
depreciable
property
used
in
a
trade
or
business.
"
that
is
justice
clarke's
language.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
there
are
two
ways
that
this
could
be
approached,
and
i
think
that
either
way
gets
us
to
the
correct
answer
for
the
purpose
of
tax
administration,
as
it
should
be
interpreted
and
applied.
the
first
of
these
is
that
you
don't
get
to
1221
if
there
are
certain
factors
present.
a
good
argument
can
be
made
that
that
is
what
burnet
v.
harmel
was
all
about,
because
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
that
mr.
harmel
sold
property.
he
sold
oil
and
gas
leases,
he
sold
seven-eighths
interest,
of
1932.
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
1955,
in
the
corn
futures
case,
that
futures
fitted
within
what
then
was
the
58-40
ruling,
that
if
you
were
a
speculator,
that
that
was
a
capital
asset.
you
have
to
look
at
the
motive.
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
p.g.
lake,
when
mr.
lake
and
the
o'connor
estate
sold
oil
payments,
they
sold
property.
but
what
the
court
said
was
that
you
didn't
get
there,
that
it
wasn't
1221
and
the
language
that
you
would
have
to
go
back
to
is
the
1921
act.
now,
you
could
go
a
different
direction
to
divine
the
purpose
of
congress,
and
that
may
be
a
more
palatable
way,
because
this
court
has
done
that,
if
you
will
recall,
and
the
reason
i
went
back
to
1932,
the
other
way
is
that
you
look
to
see
what
congress
was
trying
to
tax
in
one
manner
and
what
it
was
trying
to
tax
in
another.
justice
white,
as
for
example,
justice
sutherland's
opinion
in
gregory,
where
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute,
there
is
nothing
in
the
reorganization
sections
about
a
business
purpose
for
reorganization.
and
yet
that
has
been
a
requirement
since
ms.
gregory's
case
in
1935.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
about
continuity
of
interest
required
for
a
reorganization.
that
was
reaffirmed
recently
by
this
court.
it
started
out
in
letulle
v.
scofield
and
in
pinellas
ice.
but
it
was
reaffirmed
within
the
last
four
years
by
this
court.
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute
about
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
hillsboro,
there
was
nothing
about
there
being
a
tax
benefit
rule.
but
it
was
a
way
to
implement
how
congress
intended
a
tax
be
generated
on
income.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
also
within
the
last
four
years
in
this
court's
opinion
in
bob
jones
university.
there
is
no
requirement
of
a
common
law
of
charity
in
the
statute,
in
170,
it's
not
there.
but
it
is
a
reasonable
approach
to
what
the
people
over
on
the
other
side
of
this
hill
meant
as
to
what
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
and
that's
what
you
came
up
with
in
corn
products.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
they
would
have
automatically
been
taken
out.
but
part
of
it
was.
congress
was
starting
with
a
new
revenue
act
when
it
wrote
this
in
1921
and
when
it
said
whether
or
not
it
is
the
business
of
the
taxpayer,
they
wanted
to
show
that
a
taxpayer
in
business
could
have
a
capital
asset.
and
it
is
clear
that
they
could.
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
that
it
could
have
been
done
a
different
way.
i
just
suggest
to
you,
your
honor--
mr.
vester
t.
hughes,
jr.
--there
is
no
doubt
about
it,
that
corn
products
suffers
from
that
difficulty
of
analysis.
the
fact
remains
that
in
many
instances,
you
don't
get
to
the
level
of
the
statute
to
talk
about
it.
if
the
word
"dominant"
is
terribly
important
here...
dominant
purpose.
dominant
purpose.
those
may
have
dual
purposes,
as
indeed
corn
futures
might
have.
the
classic
case
that
came
up
to
this
court
was
the
one
on
rental
cars
which
you
had
to
make
the
decision,
and
then
you
did
make
the
decision.
