justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
united
states
tax
court
held
that
the
stock
that
was
purchased
for
business
purposes
was
subject
to
ordinary-loss
treatment.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
this
determination.
we
conclude
that
petitioner's
purpose
in
acquiring
the
stock
is
irrelevant
to
the
determination
whether
the
stock
is
within
the
broad
definition
of
capital
assets
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eighth
circuit.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
