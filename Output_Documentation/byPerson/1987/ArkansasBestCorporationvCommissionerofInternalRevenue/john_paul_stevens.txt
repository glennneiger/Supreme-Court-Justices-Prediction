mr.
horowitz,
it
seems
to
me
that
almost
by
definition,
these
transactions
are
ones
in
which
if
they
are
not
made
for
an
investment
purpose
but
as
in
booth
or
the
other
case,
to
secure
an
inventory
or
get
some
business
objective
accomplished,
that
it
is
probably
not
a
wise
investment
and
there
is
a
probability
of
a
loss.
you
are
willing
to
do
it
even
if
you
face
the
consequence
of
a
loss.
that's
sort
of
almost
the
test,
isn't
it?
if
the
business
purpose
dominates
the
transaction,
and
you
are
willing
to
do
it
for
the
business
reason
even
if
you
lose,
it
just
isn't
a
normal
investment.
justice
stevens
that's
true.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
that
was
before
1971.
justice
stevens
that
was
before
1971,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
they
were
only
talking
about
those
purchases
made
to
protect
their
reputation.
justice
stevens
can
i
go
back
to
corn
products
for
a
second?
is
it
your
view
that
it
was
the
exclusion
number
1?
the
court
didn't
say
that,
did
it?
the
court
just
said
that
literally
none
of
the
exceptions
covered
it,
because
they
say
in
so
many
words
1>
["]
doesn't
apply.
maybe
that
is
the
best
place
to
put
it.
but
all
i'm
suggesting
is
i
think
maybe
you
are
putting
it
there
and
that
the
court
in
corn
products
didn't.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
but
justice
clarke
said
it
was
really
a
form
of
insurance.
