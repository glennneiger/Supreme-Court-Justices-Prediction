justice
blackmun
you
are
not
saying
the
internal
revenue
service
has
always
been
consistent,
are
you?
justice
blackmun
now
that
i
have
you
interrupted,
am
i
correct
in
assuming
the
tax
court
decision
here
was
not
reviewed
by
the
full
court?
justice
blackmun
it
was?
justice
blackmun
yes.
but
it
was
not
reviewed,
in
the
technical
use
of
that
term,
by
the
tax
court?
justice
blackmun
that
is
out
of
my
line
with
my
understanding
of
long
standing.
but
then,
go
ahead.
justice
blackmun
that
is
rev.
rule
58-40?
justice
blackmun
did
you
cite
58-40
in
your
original
brief?
justice
blackmun
it
isn't
in
the
index,
and
hence,
if
you
didn't,
of
course,
then
the
government
doesn't
have
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
it.
you
do
cite
it
in
your
reply
brief.
justice
blackmun
do
you
have
any
comments
about
rev.
rule
58-40?
justice
blackmun
mr.
horowitz,
straighten
me
out
on
my
technical
question.
was
the
tax
court
opinion
reviewed
by
the
full
court?
justice
blackmun
i
didn't
think
it
was.
thank
you.
justice
blackmun
is
there
any
disagreement
about
that
at
all?
