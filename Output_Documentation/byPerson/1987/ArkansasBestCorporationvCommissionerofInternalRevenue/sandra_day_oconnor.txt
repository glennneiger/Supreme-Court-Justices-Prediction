justice
o'connor
mr.
hughes,
may
i
inquire
about
this
particular
case?
justice
o'connor
i
take
it
that
the
stock
acquired
after
1972
was
listed
or
referred
to
in
the
financial
records
of
the
company
as
an
investment.
justice
o'connor
as
an
investment.
justice
o'connor
what
if
the
price
of
that
stock
had
gone
up,
and
it
had
been
sold?
i
suppose
the
company
might
have
wanted
to
get
capital
gains
treatment
of
it?
justice
o'connor
and
the
irs
would
be
in
the
position
of
saying
no,
it
ought
to
be
an
ordinary
gain,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
this
is
a
bit
of
a
twist.
because
normally,
had
there
been
any
kind
of
a
gain,
the
situations
would
be
exactly
reversed,
or
the
positions
taken,
perhaps.
justice
o'connor
so
it
can
cut
two
ways.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
this
is
of
diminishing
importance
in
light
of
the
tax
code
changes
and
the
withdrawal
of
capital
gains
treatment
altogether?
justice
o'connor
mr.
hughes,
it
might
not
be
totally
unreasonable
to
take
the
position
that
assets
acquired
to
preserve
existing
assets
necessarily
acquire
the
same
characteristic
as
the
assets
sought
to
be
preserved.
that
kind
of
concept
isn't
unknown
in
the
law.
justice
o'connor
mr.
horowitz,
it
seems
to
me
that
until
the
1986
changes
to
the
revenue
code,
that
it
was
often
to
the
advantage
of
the
irs
to
adopt
the
very
view
that
petitioner
does
here,
that
we
ought
to
preserve
the
corn
products
doctrine
and
prevent
things
from
being
treated
as
capital
gains.
and
is
the
government
changing
its
position
simply
because
the
tax
law
changed
in
1986
and
now
it
cannot
work
to
the
irs's
advantage
any
longer
to
maintain
the
corn
products
rule?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
irs
has
been
wholly
consistent
n
its
approach
to
the
corn
products
doctrine
all
these
years?
you
asked
for
the
corn
products.
justice
o'connor
mr.
horowitz,
haven't
some
of
those
court
of
appeals
opinions
gone
in
favor
of
the
government
to
deny
a
taxpayer
capital
gains
treatment
and
have
benefitted
the
government
in
the
past?
justice
o'connor
mr.
horowitz,
you
know,
if
you
are
right,
that
the
statute
as
written
governs,
it
is
awfully
hard
to
fit
even
corn
products'
so-called
inventory
exception
with
that,
because
those
futures
weren't
inventory.
the
court
said
they
were
something
that
helped
the
taxpayer
maintain
an
inventory.
but
you
can't
say
they
really
are
stock
in
trade
or
inventory.
justice
o'connor
mr.
hughes,
do
you
think
your
taxpayer
fits
within
the
language
of
the
statute
somehow?
