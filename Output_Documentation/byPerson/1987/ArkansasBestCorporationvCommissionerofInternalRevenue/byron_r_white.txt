as
in
corn
products.
justice
white
now
you
are
getting
down
to
it.
justice
white
well,
yes,
you
can,
but
the
government
says
that,
so
what?
it
is
still
a
capital
asset.
justice
white
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
there
weren't
any
exceptions
to
the
capital
asset
definition.
justice
white
i
take
it
your
answer
to
me
is
well,
corn
products
would
have
come
out
that
way
if
there
were
no
exceptions?
justice
white
this
is
just
the
stock
purchased
after
1971
that
is
at
issue
here?
justice
white
i
know.
he
only
brings
here
the
post-1971
purchases.
justice
white
i
don't
blame
you.
justice
white
and
all
the
courts
who
have
been
following
corn
products,
other
than
in
hedging
operations,
have
really
misread
the
case.
justice
white
all
of
those
judges?
justice
white
congress
has
certainly
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
disagree
with
all
these
courts
and
it
has
never
disturbed--
justice
white
was
that
the
first
time
you
have
really
taken
aim
at
corn
products?
justice
white
your
position
didn't
prevail
in
all
those
cases?
justice
white
i
take
it
we
have
had
cases
in
the
past
where
a
regulation
has
approved
a
certain
course
of
action
and
the
treasurer
changes
its
mind
and
changes
the
regulation.
and
certainly
you
are
not
doing
any
more
than
that
here.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
what
would
you
say
if
you
were
asked
do
you
think
that
adopting
your
position
would
upset
some
very
subtle
expectations
of
taxpayers,
that
they
stand
to
lose
a
lot
of
money?
justice
white
in
this
case
i
would
suppose
that
they
were
going
to
buy
this
stock
no
matter
what.
justice
white
and
to
whatever
extent
the
treasury
has
departed
from
that
basic
proposition
in
the
past,
it
has
now
changed
its
mind?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
to
the
extent
you
have,
you
shouldn't
be
stuck
with
it.
but
i
think
you
have
changed
your
mind.
justice
white
mr.
horowitz,
i
take
it
you
are
arguing
here
that
the
statute
is
so
clear
that
the
treasury
would
never
be
permitted
to
again
issue
some
of
the
revenue
rulings
that
it
has,
that
any
departure,
anything
outside
a
narrow
reading
of
corn
products
is
just
forbidden
by
the
statute.
you
are
not
just
suggesting
that
this
is
a
permissible
construction
of
the
statute
that
the
treasury
department
may
follow?
justice
white
but
of
course
you
could
win
if
we
just
said
this
is
a
permissible
construction
of
the
statute
that
treasury
can
follow.
justice
white
yes.
