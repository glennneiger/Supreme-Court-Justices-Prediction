mr.
hughes,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
that
proposal
that
you
last
described
pass
the
30-day
proposal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
hughes.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
horowitz.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
court
in
corn
products
said
this
wasn't
true
hedging.
chief
justice
rehnquist
one
does
get
a
little
bit
the
feeling,
though,
of:
"heads
i
win,
tails
you
lose.
"
when
you
see
the
government's
position
in
corn
products
and
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
certainly
some
of
those
courts
of
appeals
opinions
rest
on
just
as
much
as
corn
products
did.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
government
contends
then
that
corn
products,
the
holding
of
corn
products
means
that
buying
futures
by
a
company
in
the
business
that
corn
products
was
in,
it
applies
to
that
situation
but
not
to
any
others.
it
doesn't
apply
to
stock
at
all?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
other
words,
the
only
way
stock
can
be
treated
as
ordinary
income,
a
gain
or
loss,
is
if
you
are
a
dealer?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
exception
in
the
statute
was
it
that
corn
products
came
under?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
futures
were
other
property
of
a
kind?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
horowitz.
mr.
hughes,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hughes.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-751,
arkansas
best
corporation
versus
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
