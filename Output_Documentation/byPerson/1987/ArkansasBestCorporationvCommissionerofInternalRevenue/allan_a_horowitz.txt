mr.
allan
a
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
can
be
stated
very
simply.
the
internal
revenue
code
sets
forth
limitations
on
the
deductibility
of
what
are
called
capital
losses...
that
is,
losses
suffered
on
the
sale
or
exchange
of
a
capital
asset.
and
the
question
here
is
whether
the
losses
suffered
by
petitioner
on
the
sale
of
all
of
its
shares
of
bank
stock
in
1975
are
subject
to
those
limitations.
in
other
words,
the
question
boils
down
to
whether
those
shares
were
capital
assets.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
well,
originally
petitioner
took
the
view
in
the
tax
court
that
all
the
shares
were
ordinary--
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
--right.
now,
it
is
post-1971.
in
other
words,
it
is
conceded
that
the
earlier
ones
were
capital
assets.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
let
me
give
a
couple
of
responses
to
that.
first,
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
government
has
changed
its
position.
there
are
revenue
rulings
out
there,
and
after
the
court
denied
certiorari
in
1971
when
we
sought
to
have
the
so-called
corn
products
doctrine
reviewed,
where
the
irs
was
forced
to
give
some
guidance
in
light
of
the
lower
court
decisions
that
have
developed,
but
the
irs
has
never
embraced
and
has
always
continued
to
challenge
what
is
called
the
corn
products
doctrine.
so
i
don't
think
we
are
changing
our
position
at
all.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
i
would
like
to
separate
what
is
called
the
corn
products
doctrine--
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
--from
what
the
commissioner
is
relying
on
from
the
corn
products
decision
which
we
did
argue
for
and
which
we
continue
to
think
is
correct.
the
corn
products
decision
did
not
create
this
kind
of
amorphous
judicial
exception
which
throws
the
terms
of
section
1221
out
the
window.
it
was
a
finding
that
so-called
hedging
transactions
which
had
always
been
recognized
administratively
as
inventory
transactions,
not
as
speculative
capital
transactions,
fell
within
the
inventory
exception
to
section
1221.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
the
court
said
it
wasn't
true
hedging.
that
was
the
issue
that
came
before
it,
whether
what
was
called
true
hedging
in
the
irs'
interpretation
was
the
only
thing
that
could
follow
from
the
inventory
exception
or
whether
the
sort
of
hedging
that
was
involved
in
corn
products
could
also
fall
within
the
inventory
exception.
that
is
what
the
court
held,
and
the
second
circuit
held
there.
the
only
difference
between
the
so-called
true
hedging
and
what
actually
happened
in
corn
products
was
that
the...
well,
maybe
i
should
back
up
and
talk
about
the
facts
of
corn
products
a
little.
there,
the
corn
products
company
was
engaged
in,
made
a
lot
of
contracts
for
selling
its
corn
products
at
fixed
prices.
it
did
not
have
a
lot
of
storage
capacity
for
raw
corn.
so
what
had
happened
to
it
a
couple
times
in
the
late
1930s
was
that
it
had
gotten
squeezed
by
rapid
rises
in
the
price
of
corn.
it
was
already
committed
to
sell
its
corn
oil
at
a
given
price
and
it
had
to
buy
corn
at
a
much
higher
price
than
it
had
anticipated,
which
led
to
losses
on
the
sale
of
its
product.
so
to
protect
itself
against
those
sort
of
price
rises,
what
it
did
was,
it
bought
corn
futures,
so
that
it
was
assured
a
supply
of
corn
at
a
price
that
it
could
depend
on
later.
now,
the
only
difference
from
the
true
hedge
is
that
it
did
not
protect
itself
against
a
decline
in
the
price
of
corn.
that
is
not
what
it
was
concerned
about.
it
was
worried
about
the
losses
that
it
would
suffer
on
the
sales
of
its
product.
if
the
price
of
corn
had
declined,
then,
it
would
have
suffered
some
losses
on
the
futures,
because
the
value
of
its
futures
would
have
declined.
so
there
was
an
element
of
possibility
of
loss
there
on
the
value
of
its
futures,
but
that
wasn't
what
it
was
worried
about,
and
it
didn't
really
affect
the
fact
that
the
corn
futures
were
really
part
of
their
inventory
control
system,
and
essentially
were
a
substitute
for
stored
corn.
and
that
is
what
the
court
held
in
corn
products.
it
didn't
hold
anything
more,
and
i
think
as
we
through
in
great
detail
in
our
brief,
the
opinion,
while
it
is
not,
certainly,
the
clearest
opinion
that
was
ever
written,
certainly
cannot
be
said
to
he
rejected
the
idea
that
this
is
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
not
the
creation
of
a
new
exception.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
well,
i
think
i
just
have
to
reiterate
that
this
case
is
so
far
removed
from
anything
that
went
on
in
corn
products.
it
is
true
that
we
were
on
the
other
side
in
corn
products.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
that
is
absolutely
right,
starting
with
the
booth
newspapers
case.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
all
those
courts
have
misread
the
case.
i
agree.
i
think
the
fact
that
there
are
all
those
court
of
appeals
opinions
out
there
should
give
the
court
some
pause.
i
think
what
the
court
should
do
with
that
pause
is
to
read
the
opinions,
and
i
think
you
will
see
that
they
don't
rest
on
anything
other
than
a
misinterpretation
of
corn
products.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
congress
has
not
done
anything
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
well,
i
think
i
have
to
disagree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
corn
products
rested
on
a
free,
firm
foundation.
there
was
well-recognized
administrative
construction
that
these
sorts
of
hedging
transactions
were
basically
inventory
transactions.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
well,
i
actually
never
really
finished
answering
the
question
before,
justice
o'connor.
let
me
try
to
get
back
to
it.
i
don't
think
it
has
really
been
a
"heads
i
win,
tails
you
lose.
"
proposition
for
the
government,
because
it
is
effectively
impossible,
practically
impossible,
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
case
where
the
government
can
successfully
challenge
a
taxpayer's
assertion
that
he
bought
a
stock
as
an
investment.
the
taxpayer,
it
is
not
even
going
to
be
discovered
in
audit
if
the
taxpayer
has
a
gain
on
the
sale
of
stock.
he
is
going
to
report
it
as
investment
capital
gain
and
there
isn't
going
to
be
anything
the
government
can
do
about
it.
so
it
might
be
that
the
government
would
like
to
be
arguing
in
these
gain
cases,
to
be
invoking
the
corn
products
doctrine
in
its
favor,
but
the
fact
is
that
it
is
just
practically
impossible
for
it
to
do
it,
and
i
don't
know
that
it
has
ever
successfully
done
it.
the
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
points
out
that
sometimes
the
government
wins
these
cases
when
there
are
disputes
about
whether
it
is
a
capital
loss
or
not.
but
i
don't
know
about
capital
gain
cases.
so
i
don't
think
it
has
ever
been
a
process,
and
i
don't
think
the
1986
act
changed
that.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
and
i
should
also
add
that
the
fact
that
the
capital
gain,
the
difference
in
rates
on
capital
gains
still
does
not
completely
remove
the
incentive
or
the
opportunity
for
the
taxpayers
to
play
a
game,
because
it
is
still
in
the
taxpayer's
interest
in
many
cases
to
have
an
investment
gain
or
to
have
a
gain
on
sale
of
stock
treated
as
a
capital
gain.
to
give
you
an
example,
suppose
a
company
had
a
$100,000
in
regular
income
from
its
manufacturing
operations
and
it
also
had
a
$100,000
capital
loss
on
the
sale
of
investment
stock,
that
was
clearly
an
investment.
and
suppose
there
is
a
third
category
of
money
out
there.
they
have
some
what
we
might
call
corn
products
stock,
stock
that
they
would
be
able
to
gin
up
a
kind
of
argument
that
there
was
a
business
purpose
for
getting
it.
well,
if
they
sell
that
stock
at
a
gain,
let's
say
also
a
$100,000
gain
there,
it
is
in
their
interest
to
have
that
$100,000
be
denoted
capital
gain,
because
it
will
then
give
them
an
opportunity
to
offset
their
$100,000
capital
loss
that
they
have
on
the
sale
of
investment
stock.
so
the
upshot
would
be
that
they
only
have
$100,000
in
total
income
whereas
if
that
so-called
corn
products
stock
is
treated
as
ordinary
gain,
then
a
capital
loss
will
not
be
available
to
them
and
they'll
have
to
report
$200,000
in
income.
so
the
problem
that
we
identify
in
our
brief
of
where
the
taxpayers
can
kind
of
wait
and
see
whether
they
have
a
gain
or
loss
and
then
decide
how
to
treat
it
still
remains,
although
to
something
of
a
lesser
extent,
under
the
1986
act.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
well,
in
the
litigation
in
this
case
from
the
start
we
asserted
that
the
windle
case
that
is
mentioned
in
the
briefs,
which
is
the
tax
court's
version
of
the
corn
products
doctrine
is
also
a
case
where
we
argued
the
corn
products
doctrine
didn't
exist.
we
argued
to
the
first
circuit
on
appeal
there,
and
that
appeal
had
to
be
dismissed
because
of
a
jurisdictional
problem.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
1978?
late
1970s.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
i
don't
believe
so.
all
these
cases,
booth
newspapers
and
schlumberger,
and
all
these
cases,
are
all
cases
we
lost,
and
we
were
always
litigating
as
a
taxpayer
and
always
losing.
but
i
haven't
looked
at
the
briefs
in
all
those
cases
to
see
exactly
what
the
government's
position
was.
but
i
think
the
government
has
never
taken
a
broad
reading
of
corn
products.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
no.
no
question
about
that.
we
had
a
succession
of
losses
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
i
was
about
to
say
actually
that
rev.
rule
58-40
might
be
something
of
an
exception
to
what
i've
just
said.
rev.
rule
58-40
is
not
discussed
directly,
but
it
is
discussed
sort
of
indirectly
in
our
brief
at
footnote
27,
page
45.
there
was
a
decision
of
the
tax
court
in
1952
called
western
wine
&
liquor
company.
that
was
a
pretty
narrow
fact
situation,
but
it
did
involve
stock.
it
was
a
case
where
the
stock
of
a
liquor
company
was
purchased
for
a
very
short
time
and
the
court
found
it
was
purchased
for
the
sole
purpose
of
assuring
a
supply
of
liquor,
basically
for
an
inventory
purpose.
rev.
rule
58-40...
the
service
lost
that
case.
we
had
challenged
it
and
litigated
against
it.
but
the
service
then
did
not...
acquiesced
in
the
decision,
and
rev.
rule
58-40
accepted
that
decision
as
correct.
so
to
that
narrow
extent,
in
1958,
the
service
did
accept
that
stock
could
be
an
ordinary
asset.
we
don't
think
western
wine
was
a
crazy
result.
we
don't
think
rev.
rule
58-40
is
completely
off
the
wall.
but
we
have
concluded,
as
we
explained
in
our
footnote,
that
given
the
difficulty
that
the
courts
have
had
in
captioning
this
kind
of
exception
in
any
sort
of
narrow
form,
it
is
really
better,
and
more
administratable,
to
have
a
rule
that
does
not
allow
stock
at
all
to
be
a
non-capital
asset.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
i
think
we
are
doing
quite
a
bit
less
than
that.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
we
have
been
trying
for
a
long
time
to
get
to
the
supreme
court
on
this
issue,
and
we
are
finally
here.
you
know,
we
file
this
petition
in
1971.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
well,
the
service,
if
the
government
prevails
in
this
case,
the
service
is
going
to
have
to
figure
out
how
to
deal
with
that.
it
may
do
it
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
well,
yes,
i
was
going
to
go
on
to
say
that
this
is
not
the
sort
of
area
where
there
is,
i
think
a
big
expectations
problem.
a,
you're
talking
only
about
stock
that
supposedly
was
purchased
for
a
business
purpose,
that
they
would
have
done
anyway;
b,
you
are
only
talking
about
cases
where
they
suffer
losses
on
the
sale
or
exchange
of
the
stock.
and
presumably
they
didn't
go
into
these
transactions
with
the
expectation
of
suffering
losses.
so
there
may
be
some
case
where
there
is.
i
can't
say
there
is
no
case
where
there
are
no
expectations.
but
it's
not
a
big
issue.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
it
does
have
application
in
some
other
areas,
although
stock
has
been
in
the
main
focus
of
the
litigation.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
well,
i
know
there
is
a
ruling
out
there
about
transactions
in
foreign
currency
i
think
that
the
treasury
had
treated
it
as
the
corn
products
doctrine
applying
to
that,
although
i
think
that
has
actually
been,
there
is
a
special
treatment
for
foreign
currency
now
in
the
1986
act
anyway.
i'm
not
sure,
justice
scalia.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
if
the
business
purpose
is
so
predominant,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
probably
aren't
worried
about
the
tax,
whether
it's
going
to
be
a
capital
loss
or
not,
either.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
i
think
one
of
the
problems
with
the
corn
products
doctrine
is
that
you
can't
separate
out
the
business
and
investment
purpose
so
well.
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
arkansas
best
told
their
stockholders
that
they
had
all
this
information
about
what
a
great
investment
this
national
bank
of
commerce
stock
was
going
to
be.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
the
two
motives
tend
to
coalesce.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
yes,
that
was
before
1971.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
well,
again,
we
discussed
in
our
brief
that
i
don't
really
accept
the
characterization
that
the
tax
court
made
this
finding
that
that
was
the
only
purpose
of
purchasing
the
stock.
the
tax
court
also
said
that
it
was
to
preserve
their
equity
in
the
company.
as
justice
o'connor
said
before,
basically
they
had
an
investment
in
the
company
and
they
were
trying
to
protect
that
investment
and
enhance
that
investment.
so
i
am
not
sure
that
i
agree
that
the
later
purchases
were
necessarily
covered
by
it.
but
i
kind
of
don't
want
to
get
into
that
because
we
don't
think
that
the
doctrine
is
sound
at
all,
and
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
statute
a
little
bit.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
that
is
correct.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
if
you
are
a
dealer,
that's
right.
and
that
would
follow
from
corn
products.
that
is
the
same
principle
if
it
is
being
held
as
inventory
than
it
is
an
ordinary
asset,
and
that
is
what
the
statute
says
in
1221(1).
but
only
dealers
hold
stock--
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
--well--
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
--okay.
but
i
just
don't
think
we
have
departed
very
far
from
that.
i've
been
here
before
talking
about--
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
--yes,
we've
changed
our
mind.
after
we've
seen
what
has
happened
with
the
corn
products
doctrine,
we
decided
that
any
possible
extension
of
corn
products
is
a
very
bad
idea.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
the
courts
of
appeals
made
us
do
it.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
despite
petitioner's
avoidance
of
it
in
this
brief,
there
is
a
statute
that
addresses
this
issue,
at
section
1221
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
i
would
like
to
focus
on
it
a
little
bit,
because
we
do
think
it
controls
this
case.
it
is
set
forth
at
pages
1
to
3
of
our
brief.
the
statute
says
the
term
"capital
asset"
means
property
held
by
the
taxpayer,
whether
or
not
connected
with
his
trade
or
business,
but
does
not
include...
and
then
it
goes
on
to
enumerate
five
specific
exceptions,
none
of
which
are
implicated
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
i
didn't
think
there
was,
although
mr.
hughes,
i
thought,
suggested
that
maybe
they
were
holding
this
national
bank
of
commerce
stock
for
sale
to
customers,
because
they
eventually
ended
up
having
to
sell
it.
then
he
seemed
to
concede
that
that
wasn't
what
the
statute
was
about.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
about
that.
he
did
say
something
in
argument
that
suggested
that.
i
guess
i
should
say
that
is
the
only
time
i
have
heard
the
petitioner
ever
suggest
how
the
statute
could
possible
be
construed
to
support
their
position.
basically,
their
position
is
that
the
statute
should
be
ignored
and
that
the
lower
courts'
exposition
of
this
corn
products
doctrine
should
be
substituted
for
the
statute.
the
first
thing
to
notice
about
the
statute
is
i
guess
what
i've
just
said.
it
clearly
doesn't
help
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
their
stock
is
property
within
the
beginning
first
clause
of
the
statute,
which
means
it
is
a
capital
asset
unless
it
is
covered
by
one
of
the
exceptions,
and
it's
not
covered
by
any
of
the
exceptions.
and
by
the
same
token,
nothing
in
the
statute
supports
the
general
rule
that
petitioners
argue
for,
that
is,
that
there
is
a
general
business
versus
investment
distinction
in
the
statute.
mr.
allan
a

section
1.
stock
and
trade
with
taxpayer
or
other
property
of
a
kind
which
would
properly
be
included
in
the
inventory
of
the
taxpayer
if
on
hand
at
the
close
of
the
taxable
year.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
yes,
that's
correct.
the
court
found
that.
now,
it
is
true
that
in
corn
products
the
court
said
it
did
not
regard
this
as
a
quote
"literal"
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
petitioners
have
kind
of
set
up
a
straw
man
here
by
saying
that
the
government
is
arguing
for
a
literal
interpretation
of
the
statute.
by
that
they
seem
to
mean
a
kind
of
wooden
reading
of
the
statute
that
you
can't
look
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
dictionary.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
i
guess
that
is
right,
justice
scalia,
because
i'm
not
sure
even
they
needed
to
say
they
were
departing
from
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
but
whether
the
statute
is
read
broadly
or
narrowly
is
not
what
the
issue
is
here.
the
issue
is
whether
the
statute
is
to
be
read
at
all.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
as
i
said,
it
is
not
a
very
clear
opinion.
the
second
circuit's
opinion
is
quite
clear.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
the
second
circuit
placed
it
under
number
1.
now,
the
court
relied
heavily
on
the
1936
general
counsel
memorandum
which
had
stated
that
these
hedging
transactions
were
not
to
be
treated
as
transactions
in
capital
assets,
that
they
were
inventory
transactions.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
that
is
what
the
general
counsel
memorandum
said
also.
but
it
was
insurance
for
their
inventory
supplies.
it
would
be
nicer
if
the
court
had
cited
the
1221(1),
but
i
don't
think
it
is
hard
to
read
the
opinion
any
other
way,
justice
stevens.
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
statute
not
only
does
not
cover
and
not
only
does
not
support
petitioner's
position
but
it
is
really
quite
hostile
to
the
exception
that
they
try
to
invoke
here.
the
corn
products
doctrine
that
petitioner
seeks
to
draw
here
can't
just
be
explained
as
some
sort
of
an
omission
by
congress
in
drafting
the
statute
or
some
extra
kind
of
exception
and
addition.
it
is
completely
antithetical
to
what
congress
has
said
and
done
in
the
statute.
the
first
thing
to
focus
on
is
the
language
right
at
the
top
of
page
2,
the
parenthetical
provision
here,
whether
or
not
connected
with
his
trade
or
business.
in
other
words,
capital
asset
includes
all
property,
whether
or
not
connected
with
his
trade
or
business.
the
only
purpose
of
that
seems
to
be
to
dispel
the
exact
intention
the
petitioner
is
making
here.
and
that
his
that
a
business
versus
investment
distinction
is
what
is
significant.
it
is
completely
insignificant
under
the
statute
and
the
statute
clearly
contemplates
that
there
would
be
capital
assets
that
were
connected
with
business.
second,
and
even
more
significantly
i
think,
is
to
look
at
the
various
exceptions.
now,
this
section
1221
was
not
enacted
as
a
whole
all
at
one
time.
it
has
been
added
to
bit
by
bit
over
the
years.
the
original
section
only
included
what
we
have
called
the
inventory
exception,
section
1.
now,
section
2,
this
was
added
in
1938,
excepts
property
used
in
his
trade
or
business,
of
a
character
which
is
subject
to
depreciation.
and
then
the
second
clause
of
section
2
adds
real
property
used
in
his
trade
or
business
that
was
added
in
1942.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
i
don't
understand
petitioner's
argument
to
be
that
corn
products
changed
the
law.
and
certainly,
it
wouldn't
have.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
i
don't
dispute
that
fact,
that
they
are
pre-1955,
but
i
don't
think
it
really
undermines
our
argument.
all
of
these
exceptions
show
that
congress
never
thought
that
the
statute
drew
a
business
purpose
versus
investment
purpose
distinction.
i
don't
understand
petitioners
to
argue
that
that
distinction
arose
in
1955.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
congress
has
not
said
anything
about
corn
products,
one
way
or
the
other.
i
don't
think
that
is
so
remarkable,
really,
because
clearly,
just
as
you
can
see
from
the
briefs
in
this
case,
it
is
a
controversial
issue.
the
service
feels
strongly
about
it
and
taxpayers
feel
strongly
about
it,
and
congress
has
basically
decided
not
to
get
into
it.
the
little
legislative
history
in
1976,
if
anything,
suggests
that
somebody
in
congress
thought
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
make
some
compromise,
and
probably
nobody
liked
the
compromise
so
they
just
decided
to
let
it
drop.
so
i
guess
i
just
don't
think
you
can
say
either
way.
but
you
can
say,
i
think,
that
petitioner's
argument
that
since
1921,
which
is
what
they
say
in
the
reply
brief,
and
say
here
today,
that
there
has
been
this
business
versus
investment
exception,
is
quite
wrong,
because
otherwise,
all
of
these
exceptions
are
completely
unnecessary.
the
fact
is,
that
in
1938,
when
congress
added
section
2,
everybody
understood
that
a
factory
was
a
capital
asset
and
that
this
change
in
the
statute
was
necessary
to
except
it
from
capital
asset
determination.
maybe
i
should
just
talk
briefly
about
their
argument
on
the
1921
act,
seems
to
turn
on
the
particular
language
of
the
1921
act,
which
included
the
phrase
"for
profit
and
investment".
this
is
set
forth
at
page
20,
footnote
10
of
our
brief.
they
read
that
language
as
just
saying
"for
investment"
and
suggesting
that
capital
assets
have
to
be
investment
property.
but
the
actual
language
of
the
statute
is
"for
profit
or
investment"
and
the
term
"for
profit"
i
think
clearly
contemplates
business,
so-called
business
assets.
one
straw
man
that
petitioners
have
set
forth
today
in
their
argument
is
this
notion
that
you
can't
look
into
motive
or
the
purpose
for
acquiring
an
asset
under
the
government's
position.
that's
not
right.
we
never
suggested
that.
it
is
clear
enough
again
that
the
statute
contemplates
in
certain
circumstances
an
inquiry
into
motive.
in
the
second
exception,
it
looks
into
whether
the
property
is
used
in
a
trade
or
business.
so
you
have
to
look
at
that.
under
the
inventory
exception,
some
assets
may
or
may
not
fall
under
the
inventory
exception,
depending
on
the
use
they
are
put
to.
that
was
true
in
corn
products.
that
was
true
in
an
example
that
petitioners
give
in
their
brief.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
i
agree.
it
is
not
up
to
the
service.
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
except
stock
in
any
circumstance.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
well,
i
suppose
so,
although
that
is
not
what
we
are
arguing.
we
are
arguing
the
statute
sets
forth
a
definition.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
i
really
view
this
whole
case
as
kind
of
ironic,
because
i
know
the
court,
this
court
and
other
courts
are
often
grappling,
trying
to
define
terms
in
the
internal
revenue
code
and
trying
to
define
policies
behind
them
and
wondering
why
the
code
doesn't,
why
congress
doesn't
just
define
the
term
for
it,
and
here
that
is
exactly
what
they
have
done.
mr.
allan
a
horowitz
i
guess
there
you
are
just
talking
about
sort
of
a
narrow
versus
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
think
the
court
found
that
the
purposes
of
the
inventory
exception
were
served
by
having
these
futures
in,
and
they
pointed
out
the
problems
there
would
be
if
they
were
not
treated
as
inventory.
for
example,
at
the
end
of
the
opinion,
the
court
noted
that
the
taxpayers
could
decide
for
themselves
whether
to
make
them
ordinary
or
capital.
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
before
my
red
light
goes
on
is
that
the
policy,
the
congressional
intent
that
petitioners
rely
on
is
not
supported
by
the
slightest
bit
of
evidence.
there
is
nothing
in
the
reports,
nothing
in
any
other
inquiry
into
congressional
intent
that
suggests
that
there
was
ever
a
general
business
versus
investment
dichotomy.
the
categories
of
assets
that
congress
decided
should
be
separated
between
capital
and
ordinary
were
set
forth
in
section
1221.
congress
has
added
to
those
periodically
and
there
is
no
other
real
policy
to
be
relied
upon
here.
thank
you.
