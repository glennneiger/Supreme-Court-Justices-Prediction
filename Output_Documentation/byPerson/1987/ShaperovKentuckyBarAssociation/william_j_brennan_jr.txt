justice
jr.
mr.
cox,
the
kentucky
court
did
strike
down
the
original
rule,
did
it
not?
justice
jr.
it
withdrew
it.
and
do
i
understand...
pardon?
withdrew
it?
did
it?
justice
jr.
oh,
all
right.
justice
jr.
well,
i
was
going
to
ask
next,
did
the
kentucky
supreme
court
say
why
they
struck
that
one
down?
justice
jr.
but
the
rule
you
have
brought
before
us
now,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
precise
counterpart
of
the
aba
rule,
is
it
not?
justice
jr.
well,
as
to
their
reasons
for
striking
down
the
first
rule,
do
you
suggest
they
just
misspoke?
justice
jr.
did
the
kentucky
supreme
court
disapprove
this
letter?
it
did,
did
it
not?
justice
jr.
it
disapproved
it,
did
it
not?
justice
jr.
and
did
it
not
disapprove
it
on
the
basis
of
the
new
rule?
justice
jr.
well
then,
why
is
the
case
here?
that's
what
he's
bringing
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
first
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky.
the
attorneys
advertising
commission
of
kentucky's
integrated
bar
association
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
regulating
attorney
advertising
as
prescribed
by
rules
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court.
the
commission's
decisions
are
appealable
to
the
board
of
governors
of
the
kentucky
bar
association,
and
they
are
ultimately
reviewable
by
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky.
one
of
the
provisions
says
that
any
attorney
who
is
in
doubt
as
to
the
propriety
of
any
professional
act
contemplated
by
him
has
the
option
of
seeking
an
advisory
opinion
from
the
committee
of
the
kentucky
bar
association
which
are
formally
adopted
by
the
board
of
governors
is
reviewable
by
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky.
in
this
case,
petitioner,
a
member
of
the
kentucky
bar,
applied
to
the
commission
for
approval
of
a
letter
that
he
proposed
to
send
to
potential
clients
who
have
had
a
foreclosure
suit
filed
against
them
which
among
other
things
advised
the
client
that
is
solicited,
â€œyou
may
be
about
to
lose
your
home,
[f]ederal
law
may
allow
you
to
orde[r]
your
creditor
to
stop,"
you
may
call
my
office
for
free
information,
[i]t
may
surprise
you
what
i
may
be
able
to
do
for
you
"
although
the
commission
did
not
find
the
letter
false
or
misleading,
it
declined
to
approve
it
on
the
ground
that
a
then
existing
kentucky
supreme
court
rule
prohibited
the
mailing
or
delivery
of
written
advertisements
precipitated
by
a
specific
event
involving
or
relating
to
the
addressee
as
distinct
from
the
general
public.
nevertheless,
the
commission
registered
its
view
that
the
rule
violated
the
first
amendment
under
our
decision
in
zauderer,
a
few
terms
ago
and
recommended
the
rule's
amendment
by
the
state
supreme
court.
petitioner
then
sought
an
advisory
committee
--
an
opinion
rather,
as
to
the
rule's
validity
from
the
state
bar
association's
ethics
committee,
and
that
committee
upheld
the
rule
as
consistent
with
rule
7.3
of
the
american
bar
association's
model
rules
of
professional
conduct.
on
review
of
the
advisory
opinion,
the
state
supreme
court
held
that
our
decision
in
zauderer
compelled
the
state
rule's
deletion,
and
replaced
it
with
a
copy
of
the
american
bar
association
rule
7.3,
which
also
prohibits
targeted
direct-mail
solicitation
by
lawyers
for
a
pecuniary
gain
without
a
particularized
finding
that
the
solicitation
is
false
or
misleading.
the
court
did
not
specify
either
the
precise
informative
--
infirmity
in
the
state
rule
or
how
the
american
bar
association
rule
7.3
cured
it.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
and
remand.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
which
holds
for
the
court
as
to
parts
i
and
ii
that
a
state
may
not,
consistent
with
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
categorically
prohibit
lawyers
from
soliciting
business
for
pecuniary
gain
by
sending
truthful
and
non-deceptive
letters
to
potential
clients
known
to
face
particular
legal
problems.
such
advertising
is
constitutionally
protected
commercial
speech,
which
may
be
restricted
only
in
the
service
of
a
substantial
governmental
interest,
and
only
through
means
that
directly
advance
that
interest.
moreover,
this
court's
lawyer
advertising
cases
have
never
distinguished
among
various
modes
of
written
advertising
to
the
general
public,
as
is
recognized
by
american
bar
associations
rule
7.3's
exemption
for
advertising
distributed
generally
to
persons
not
known
to
need
the
particular
legal
services,
but
who
are
so
situated
that
they
might,
in
general,
find
such
services
useful.
the
court
below
disapproved
petitioner's
letter
solely
on
the
basis
of
its
failure
to
qualify
for
this
exemption,
analogizing
to
our
decision
again
of
a
few
terms
ago
in
ohralik
for
the
proposition
that
targeted
direct-mail
solicitation
by
a
trained
lawyer
to
a
potential
client
overwhelmed
by
his
legal
troubles
and
therefore,
having
an
impaired
capacity
for
good
judgment
creates
a
serious
potential
for
undue
influence.
however,
respondent's
reliance
on
ohralik,
which
held
that
the
state
could
categorically
ban
all
in-person
solicitation,
we
think
is
misplaced.
there
are
two
factors
underlying
that
decision,
the
strong
possibility
of
improper
lawyer
conduct
and
the
improbability
of
effective
regulation
are
much
less
a
risk
in
the
targeted,
direct-mail
solicitation
context.
the
recipient
of
such
advertising
is
not
faced
with
the
coercive
presence
of
a
trained
advocate
or
the
pressure
for
an
immediate
yes-or-no
answer
to
the
representation
offer,
but
can
simply
put
the
letter
aside
or
to
be
considered
later,
ignored,
or
discarded.
moreover,
although
a
personalized
letter
does
present
increased
risk
of
isolated
abuses
or
mistakes,
these
we
think
can
be
regulated
and
minimized
by
requiring
the
lawyer
to
file
a
letter
with
a
state
agency
as
in
kentucky
having
authority
to
supervise
mailings
and
penalize
actual
abuses.
scrutiny
of
targeted
solicitation
letters
will
not
be
appreciably
less
reliable
in
our
view
than
scrutiny
of
other
advertisements,
since
the
reviewing
agency
can
require
the
lawyer
to
prove
or
verify
any
fact
stated
or
explain
how
it
was
discovered.
then,
as
to
part
iii
of
the
opinion
i
have
filed,
which
is
joined
by
justice
marshall,
justice
blackmun,
and
justice
kennedy,
concludes
that
although
the
validity
of
rule
7.3
doesn't
turn
on
whether
petitioner's
letter
itself
exhibited
any
of
the
evils
at
which
the
rule
was
directed,
respondent's
contention
that
the
letter
is
particularly
overreaching,
and
therefore
unworthy
of
first
amendment
protection,
must
be
addressed
since
the
amendment's
overbreadth
doctrine
does
not
apply
to
professional
advertising.
however,
although
the
letter's
liberal
use
of
underscored,
uppercase
letters
in
its
inclusion
of
subjective
predictions
of
client
satisfaction
might
catch
the
recipient's
attention
more
than
would
a
bland
statement
of
purely
objective
facts
in
small
types.
the
letter
presents
no
risk
of
overreaching
comparable
to
that
of
a
lawyer
engaged
in
face-to-face
competition.
justice
white
joined
by
justice
stevens
although
agreeing
with
parts
i
and
ii
of
the
court's
opinion,
express
the
view
that
the
matters
addressed
in
part
iii
should
be
left
to
the
state
courts
in
the
first
instance.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
therefore,
concurring
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice

justice
o'connor
