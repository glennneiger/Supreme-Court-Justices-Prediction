justice
white
i
would
think
that
you
have
that
he
has
amended,
saying
"is
your
home
subject
to
foreclosure.
"
that
would
be
banned
under
this
rule?
--yes,
that
would
be
a
flat
ban.
justice
white
well,
i
think
that
if
you
take
it
you
think
that
some
targeted
mailings
could
be
forbidden?
justice
white
yes.
and
some
can't.
justice
white
so,
if
that's
the
case,
what
is
the
justification
for
declaring
this
rule
invalid
on
its
face?
that's
what
you
asked,
isn't
it?
justice
white
all
right,
then,
all
you're
really
asking
is
that,
as
applied
to
your
case,
this
rule
is
unconstitutional?
justice
white
is
that
what
you
ask?
justice
white
and
that's
all
you
ask?
justice
white
the
overbreadth
is
not
applicable
in
commercial
speech?
justice
white
mister--
--the
reason
they
looked...
you're
the
one...
it
was
the...
it
was
mr.
shapiro
that
brought
the
zauderer
case
before
them,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
we
certainly
don't
know
in
this
case
that
kentucky
supreme
court
said
this
targeted
solicitation
is,
has
to
be,
banned
under
our
rule,
even
though
it
is
not
deceptive,
and
even
though
it
is
truthful,
and
even
though
it
is
not
misleading?
justice
white
now,
let's
assume
a
court
having
read
the
cases
that
you
brought
before
them,
that
no
advertising
by
a
lawyer
can
be
banned;
no
advertising
like
this
can
be
banned
unless
it's
false,
misleading,
as
long
as
it's
truthful;
and
then
it
just
says,
"we
do
not
approve
this
letter.
"
justice
white
yes.
here's
a
court
that
knows
the
rule
and
just
says
without
any
explanation,
it
just
bans
the
letter.
don't
we
assume
that
the
court
applied
the
rule;
i
mean,
that
it
knows
is
applicable
and
that
it
made,
even
though
it
didn't
say
so,
that
it
made
the
right
findings?
justice
white
even
though
it
is
not
untruthful
and
not
misleading?
justice
white
how
does
this
disapprove
this
letter?
justice
white
why
it
disapproved
it?
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
that
shapiro
was
free
to
go
ahead
with
his
advertisement
after
the
kentucky
supreme
court
decision?
justice
white
well,
if
he
wasn't,
then
they
must
have
applied
some
rule
to
ban
it?
justice
white
and
what
did
they
apply?
justice
white
well,
the
claim
is
that
kentucky
is
not
entitled
under
the
first
amendment
to
require
this
particular
letter.
justice
white
and
that
claim
rejects
it.
justice
white
well,
what
he
said,
what
he
claimed
was,
that
he
is
entitled
to
publish
this...
to
mail,
this
advertisement;
he's
entitled
to
under
the
first
amendment.
that's
his
claim.
as
against
any
kentucky
rule.
justice
white
isn't
that
the
issue
before
us?
and
isn't
it
properly
before
us?
justice
white
you
have
to
mail
it
to
somebody.
justice
white
it's
a
rather
odd
first
amendment
doctrine
that
we
forbid
ads
only
when
they're
targeted
at
people
that
are
interested
in
them,
which
is
the
purport
of
your
argument--
