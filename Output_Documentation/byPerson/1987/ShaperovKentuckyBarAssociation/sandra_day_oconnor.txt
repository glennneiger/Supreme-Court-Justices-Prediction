justice
o'connor
yes.
that's
why
i'm
asking
the
question.
justice
o'connor
so
you
would
concede
that
higher
standards
may
be
imposed?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
state
can
ban
telephone-targeted
advertising?
justice
o'connor
mr.
cox,
how
many
states
today
do
you
think
have
this
flat
ban
on
targeted
direct
mail?
justice
o'connor
mr.
doheny,
it
strikes
me
you'd
be
well-advised
to
spend
time
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
because
i
think
your
jurisdiction
argument
may
be
unpersuasive.
and
on
the
merits,
i'm
wondering
whether
on
the
new
rule,
you
would
take
the
position
that
an
advertisement
like
this,
if
it
were
deemed
not
misleading,
could
be
published
in
the
newspaper?
then
copies
of
the
ad
mailed
directly
to
the
targeted
recipients?
justice
o'connor
yes,
and
then
could
the
newspaper
ad
be
mailed...
copies
of
it,
to
targeted
recipients?
justice
o'connor
well,
under
the
first
amendment
analysis,
why
is
it
more
of
a
concern
by
the
state
to
protect
the
recipients
from
opening
up
the
ad
in
an
envelope
than
from
reading
it
in
their
newspaper?
justice
o'connor
if
what's
in
the
envelope
is
a
copy
of
an
ad
clipped
out
of
a
newspaper,
why
isn't
that...
why
shouldn't
it
be
treated
like
the
newspaper?
