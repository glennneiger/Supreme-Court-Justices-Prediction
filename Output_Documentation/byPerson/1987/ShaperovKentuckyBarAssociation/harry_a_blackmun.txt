mr.
cox?
justice
blackmun
let
me
look
at
this
precise
letter:
it
states,
doesn't
it,
that
"it
has
come
to
my
attention
that
your
home
is
being
foreclosed
on.
"
couldn't
that
be
misleading?
it
certainly
indicates
familiarity
with
the
precise
piece
of
real
estate.
justice
blackmun
well,
mr.
cox...
go
ahead.
would
it
not
be
more
neutral
if
they
said,
started
off
by
saying,
"is
your
home
being
foreclosed"?
there
again,
there
would
be
no
connotation
of
familiarity
with
this
particular
thing,
and
it
would
be
much
more
like
the
i.u.d.
case
that
we
had
some
time
ago.
justice
blackmun
well--
justice
blackmun
--i,
might
be
that
would
be
a
mistake.
that's
what
concerns
me
a
little
bit
is
there
is
a
possibility
of
it
being
misleading.
mr.
cox,
do
you
think
that
the
state
is
free
to
impose
higher
standards
of
truthfulness
and
honesty
on
advertising
like
this
than
would
be
the
case
for
selling
soap
or
vacuum
cleaners,
or
something
of
that
kind?
