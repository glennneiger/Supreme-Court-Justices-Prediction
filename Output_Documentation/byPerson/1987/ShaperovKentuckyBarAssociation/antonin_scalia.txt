justice
scalia
mr.
cox,
you
don't
think
it's
at
all
misleading
to
say
"federal
law
may
enable
you
to...
may
allow
you
to
keep
your
home
by
ordering
your
creditors
to
stop
and
give
you
more
time
to
pay
them.
"
you
don't
think
it
would
have
been
a
little
more
forthright
to
tell
the
people
you
can
take
bankruptcy?
which
seems
a
good
deal
less
attractive
than
the
federal
law
that
allows
you
to
keep
your
home
by
ordering
your
creditors
to
stop.
isn't
this
a
little
bit
misleading?
justice
scalia
you
don't
think
it's
a
close
question
that
we
might
want
to
get
the
views
of
some
state
bar
association,
or
some
state
authorities
on
before
we
say
that
it
isn't?
justice
scalia
no,
no,
you
miss
my
point:
i'm
saying
bankruptcy
is
not
as
attractive
to
many
people
as
a
federal
law
that
enables
them
to
tell
their
creditors
to
stop.
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
calling
bankruptcy
"bankruptcy"
is
every
nit
of
the
law.
justice
scalia
mr.
doheny,
it
would
be
a
different
question
if
all
the
kentucky
supreme
court
did
was
to
say,
"you're
right,
the
old
rule
is
no
good;
we're
adopting
a
new
rule.
"
but
it
didn't
just
do
that.
you
say
that
it
went
further,
and
in
that
situation,
i
can
understand
why
you
would
say
you
would
have
to
go
back
and
see
whether,
under
state
law,
this
thing
is
banned
under
the
new
rule.
but
the
court
didn't
stop
there.
it
said,
"we're
adopting
this
new
rule
and
your
letter
is
banned
under
the
new
rule.
"
justice
scalia
did
it
say
that
or
not?
if
it
didn't
say
that,
you
have
a
different
case.
justice
scalia
well,
your
response
to
one
of
the
other
justice'
questions
was
that,
indeed,
there
has
been
a
determination
that
this
letter
is
no
good.
now
you're
saying
there
has
not
been?
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
so.
the
next
sentence
says,
"we
affirm
the
decision
of
the
ethics
committee
to
deny
the
request.
"
and
the
request
is
to
mail
out
this
letter.
so
i
think
they
not
only
set
out
the
appropriate
rule
we
should
adopt
as
the
law
in
the
case,
but
they
then
go
on
and
affirm
the
ruling.
and
may
i
ask
just
one
other
procedural
question?
justice
scalia
but
you
could
say
the
same
thing
of
a
newspaper
ad...
"call
now.
"
"don't
wait.
"
and
the
same
result
would
ensue.
really,
the
only
difference
i
see
between
the
two
is
that
one
is
economically
more
efficient
than
the
other.
is
there
some
vice
in
economically
more
efficient
advertising,
instead
of...
you
have
the
same
ad;
it
reads
exactly
the
same;
and
you
say
you
can
put
it
in
the
newspaper,
but
you
can't
mail
it
specifically
to
certain
individuals?
justice
scalia
well,
you
want
to
call
it
"targeted".
i'll
call
it
"specific".
