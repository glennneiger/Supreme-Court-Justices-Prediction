mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
parts
to
the
argument
that
i
would
like
to
present,
and
the
first
is
a
jurisdictional
one,
which
was
touched
on
briefly
by
justice
stevens
in
a
question
that
he
asked.
listening
to
petitioner's
argument,
the
court
might
conclude
that
what
we
had
below
was
an
attack
on
the
entire
kentucky
advertising
process.
that
is
not
the
case.
justice
stevens
asked,
"was
the
letter
reviewed
after
rule
7.3
was
adopted?
"
and
the
answer
to
that
is
emphatically,
"no".
the
kentucky
supreme
court
opinion
begins
with
these
words:
"this
is
a
petition
for
review
of
supreme
court
rule
3.135,
which
has
been
interpreted
by
the
advertising
commission
to
prohibit
targeted
direct
mail
advertising
by
lawyers.
"
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
the
kentucky
supreme
court
did
not
as
such
disapprove
this
letter,
justice
white.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
it
did
neither.
what
it
said
was
that
rule
3.135
pertaining
to
advertising,
was
too
broad.
what
petitioner
asked
below
was
that
rule
3.135
be
deleted;
and
what
kentucky
did
in
referring
to
zauderer
three
times
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
was
specifically
they
said,
"it
is
the
decision
of
this
court
that
supreme
court
rule
3.135
be
deleted.
"
that
is
what
they
did.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
no,
justice
white,
i
do
not.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
they
did.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
at
the
time
they
deleted
rule
3.135.
they
adopted
a
new
rule,
aba
model
rule
7.3,
which
prohibited,
was
not...
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
and
that
claim--
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
--if
the
court
please,
i
believe
that
claim
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
and
that
is
the
heart
of
our
jurisdictional
argument;
that
what
petitioner
attacked
in
the
trial
court
was
rule
3.135,
which
he
asked
be
deleted.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
and
that
gets
to
the
substantive
issue,
justice
white,
as
to
whether
kentucky
can
constitutionally
ban
the
letter
as
proposed
by
shapiro.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
again
emphatically
"yes,
it
can
be
banned.
"
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
i
think
the
issue
is
not
properly
before
you,
justice
white,
because
it
was
not
raised
in
the
kentucky
supreme
court.
what
was
raised
in
the
kentucky
supreme
court
was
a
challenge
to
rule
3.135.
when
the
court
adopted
model
rule
7.3,
petitioner
had
the
right
to
seek
rehearing
or
modification;
or
to
begin
a
new
proceeding.
he
did
none
of
those.
he
simply
sought
certiorari
from
this
court.
so
we
contend
that
by
his
failure
to
raise
that
issue
in
the
kentucky
courts,
he
has
deprived
this
court
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
it
does
not
for
these
reasons:
the
old
rule
began,
"a
written
advertisement
may
be
sent.
"
the
new
rule
begins,
"a
lawyer
may
not
solicit
professional
employment.
"
in
other
words,
it
is
the
distinction
between
advertising
on
the
one
hand
and
solicitation
on
the
other.
this
court
has
said
that
a
state
can
ban
solicitation
in
person
ohralik.
now,
what
kentucky
did
was
adopt
without
advance
notice,
admittedly,
but
what
it
did
was
adopt
a
new
rule
at
the
time
shapiro
asked
them
to
delete
rule
3.135.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
it
did.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
yes.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
yes.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
well,
our
position
is
that
that
new
rule
should
have
first
been
challenged
in
the
kentucky
supreme
court
rather
than
before
this
court.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
i
can't
get
inside
the
mind
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court,
but
they,
like
other
courts,
are
willing
to
listen
and
be
educated;
and
if
there
was
a
challenge
to
the
new
rule,
i
think
they
would
apply
their
wisdom
and
experience
to
it;
and
the
facts
that
are
presented
to
that
court
about
the
rule.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
well,
perhaps
i--
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
--well,
perhaps
i
overstated
it,
mr.
justice
scalia,
because
it
does
not
say
in
the
opinion
that
they
made
a
finding
with
respect
to
this
letter.
they
simply
say
that,
with
respect
to
rule
7.3,
this
is
an
appropriate
rule
which
we
now
adopt
as
the
law
of
this
government.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
i
believe
i
was
in
error
when
i
said,
that,
justice.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
sure.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
it
is
true.
we
were
not
counsel
for
the
kentucky
bar
association
below.
we
came
to
this
issue
late;
we
did
not
make
this
argument.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
we
did
make
it
late.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
i
think
that,
if
the
substance
of
the
letter,
justice
o'connor,
were
deemed
to
be
not
misleading,
without
question,
in
kentucky,
it
could
appear
in
a
newspaper.
we
have
broad
rules.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
no,
not
under
the
rule.
it
could
go
to
a
mass...
a
group
of
persons
under
the
rule,
with
whom...
well,
it
could
go
to
a
group
of
persons
as
long
as
they
were
not
targeted.
some
of
those
people
may,
under
the
rule,
need
the
services
that
are
offered.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
i
think
that
the
distinction
is
that
it
has
been
touched
upon
by
this
court;
that
it
gets
to
the
ability
of
a
trained
advocate
to
persuade
on
a
personal
basis.
admittedly,
the
letter
is
not
as
personal
as
the
lawyer
in
your
home
or
in
your
hospital
room,
as
was
banned
in
ohralik.
nevertheless,
as
the
florida
court
observed
in
stivers,
a
letter
carries
a
special
aura;
and
i
would
wager
that,
if
all
of
us
returned
to
our
homes
tonight
and
had
a
letter
from
a
real
estate
agent
or
a
lawyer,
we'd
open
the
lawyer's
letter
first.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
the
newspaper
ad
is
a
generalized
statement
of
advertising.
and
advertising
is,
by
definition,
going
to
a
group
of
people,
as
opposed
to
solicitation,
which
goes
to
a
more
limited
group.
now,
i
see
no
harm
that
comes
from
a
person
receiving
a
newspaper
ad
which
may
or
may
not
apply
to
him.
it
is
very
different
from
a
target
who
has
been
identified
as
either
facing
foreclosure,
or
being
the
victim
of
an
automobile
accident
or
something
else.
there
is
a
difference
between
the
general
nature
of
the
advertisement
as
opposed
to
the
in-person
or
the
letter
solicitation.
which,
justice
o'connor,
becomes
as
soon
as
that
call
is
returned,
what
this
letter
says,
for
example,
is
"call
now.
"
"don't
wait.
"
and
the
minute
that
call
is
returned,
we
have
in-person
solicitation
by
the
lawyer,
which
this
court
has
said
a
state
could
properly
prohibit.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
to
targeted
individuals.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
all
right,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
you
could
mail
it
generally
to
those
who
do
not...
are
not
known
to
have
the
problems,
some
of
whom
may.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
i'm
trying,
and
am
prepared
to,
draw
a
distinction
between
advertising
on
the
one
hand;
and
again,
solicitation
on
the
other.
i
suggest
respectfully
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference,
and
what
mr.
shapiro
chose
to
do
here
is
solicitation,
to
a
specific
individual,
which
i
believe
a
state
can,
under
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
ohralik
properly
prohibit
because
of
the
ability
of
the
lawyer
to
overreach.
mr.
frank
p.
doheny,
jr.
i
wouldn't
word
it
that
way,
justice
kennedy.
i
would
say
that
some
of
the
reasons
against
solicitations
are...
there
are
numerous
ones.
we
don't
know
if
the
person
has
a
viable
case;
we
don't
know
if
the
recipient
has
retained
a
lawyer;
we
don't
know
the
mental
or
emotional
state
of
the
recipient
when
the
solicitation
arrives
there.
i
think
there
are
valid
reasons
that
can
result
in
the
prohibition
against
solicitation,
and
the
possibility
or
probability,
whichever
term
you
choose
to
use,
of
overreaching,
is
far
greater
on
a
specific
communication
than
it
is
in
a
newspaper
or
a
television
advertisement,
which
you
are
free
to
reject
rather
easily.
this
court
has
held...
and
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
kentucky
court
did
not
reach
its
conclusion
in
a
vacuum.
it
made
a
number
of
findings.
it
found
in
its
opinion
involving
shapiro,
that
dangers
result
from
direct
solicitation,
whether
in
person
or
by
mail.
it
stated
that
it
was
not
unmindful
of
the
potential
for
serious
abuse
with
direct
solicitation.
it
held
that
the
submission
of
a
blank
form
letter
would
not
provide
suitable
protection
for
the
public,
and
it
stated
that,
under
kentucky
rules,
advertising
was
available
to
inform
the
public
of
the
need
for
legal
services,
and
the
qualifications
of
those
about
to
offer
them
without
the
risk
that
comes
through
impersonal
solicitation.
we,
this
morning...
some
new
lawyers
were
admitted
as
members
of
this
bar,
and
the
chief
justice
welcomed
them
as
officers
of
this
court.
this
court
in
virginia
board
of
pharmacy
said
"the
state
has
a
strong
interest
in
maintaining
professionalism
among
licensed
pharmacists.
"
if
that
is
true
with
dispensers
of
a
product,
and
surely
it
is;
how
much
more
true
it
must
be
with
officers
of
the
court
who
can
invoke
the
powers
of
the
court
for
good
and
for
evil?
we
suggest
that
kentucky
was
within
its
rights
in
adopting
model
rule
7.3,
and
that
the
decision
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
should
be
affirmed.
