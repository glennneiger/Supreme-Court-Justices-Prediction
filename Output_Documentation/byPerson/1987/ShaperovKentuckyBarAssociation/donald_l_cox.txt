mr.
donald
l.
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
the
third
case
in
six
years
which
has
come
to
this
court
from
the
various
district
courts
and
has
involved
absolute
bans
on
various
forms
of
written
advertising
by
attorneys.
in
each
of
those
cases,
and
they
begin
with
r.m.j.;
they
go
into
the
zauderer
case
and
now
in
the
shapiro
case.
and
in
each
of
those
cases
there
is
no
record
evidence
below
which
would
justify
the
absolute
ban
which
the
bar
association
has
advanced,
and
in
which
the
various
state
supreme
courts
sought
to
impose.
we
had
thought
that
this
court
had
made
it
absolutely
clear
in
the
zauderer
decision
when
it
said
that
an
attorney
may
not
be
disciplined
for
giving
out
truthful
and
non-deceptive
advice
to
specific
clients
about
their
legal
rights.
we
thought
that
that
had
settled
the
matter,
but
apparently
it
has
not;
and
we
are
here
once
again
on
another
issue
where
there
has
been
imposed
an
absolute
blanket
ban
on
attorney
advertising
speech.
the
issue
here
today
is
something
called
targeted
direct
mail
solicitation,
which
basically
involves
a
situation
where
an
attorney
sends
out
a
written
letter
to
a
person
whom
he
has
identified
has
having
a
specific
legal
problem;
and
that
letter
contains
some
generalized
legal
advice
similar
to
the
advice,
perhaps,
that
was
given
in
the
zauderer
advertisements.
the
kentucky
court
has
upheld
the
actual
ban,
and
that
is
why
we
are
here
today.
i
would
like
to
first
go
over
just
briefly
the
situation
in
kentucky,
the
specific,
what
i
would
call
all-encompassing
rules
regulating
attorney
advertizing,
and
then
go
briefly
into
the
facts,
and
then
into
the
legal
argument.
kentucky
probably
has
as
all-encompassing
regulation
of
attorney
advertising
as
any
state
in
this
country.
what
kentucky
has
done
as
gone
through
this
court's
decisions,
and
has
seen
in
those
decisions
where
the
court
has
indicated
various
possible
means
of
regulating
attorney
advertising.
kentucky
has,
without
exception,
adopted
all
of
those;
and
then
it's
come
up
with
some
twists
of
its
own.
as
this
court
suggested
in
r.m.j.
and
central
hudson,
first
off,
kentucky
has
a
strict
pre-submission
process.
under
that
process,
advertisements
of
the
type
we're
talking
about
here,
and
almost
all
advertisements,
except
very
limited
routine
advertisements,
are
required
to
be
pre-submitted
to
an
agency
of
the
state
bar
association
comprised
of
three
lawyers
that
are
appointed
by
the
state
bar
association.
those
three
lawyers
review
the
advertisements;
they're
given
the
power
under
the
state
regulation
to
conduct
investigations;
to
subpoena
witnesses;
and
in
addition,
under
those
regulations,
are
given
the
power
to,
in
effect,
edit
the
advertisement
by
suggesting
disclaimers;
by
suggesting
changes
in
the
language.
and
most
importantly,
i
think
from
the
standpoint
of
this
case,
under
those
regulations,
an
attorney
has
to
wait
at
least
30
days
before
sending
out
any
advertisement.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
yes
sir?
mr.
donald
l.
cox
well,
i
think
what
it
indicates,
justice
blackmun,
is
that
mr.
shapiro
had
gone
to
the
court
records
and
determined
that,
in
fact,
there
was
a
foreclosure
action
pending.
i
don't
think
that
it
indicates
any
more
than
that.
and
i
think
the
important
thing
to
note
with
respect
to
this
particular
advertisement
is
that
it
was
submitted
to
three
different
state
bodies,
and
in
not
one
of
those
three,
did
anybody
say
anything
about
it
being
false,
misleading,
deceptive,
or
anything
else.
it
was
submitted
to
the
state
advertising
commission,
who
in
the
first
instance,
reviews
all
advertisements.
it
was
submitted
to
the
ethics
committee;
again,
no
statement
that
there
was
any
problem;
it
was
submitted
to
the
state
supreme
court;
the
state
supreme
court
did
not
in
any
way
base
its
decision--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
--that
is
a
possibility.
but
i
do
not--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
--the
kentucky
supreme
court
did.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
but
they
cited...
and
i
think
it's
important
that
the
cited
in
their
decision
the
fact
that
it
had
been
reviewed
by
these
lower
court...
these
lower
bodies,
and
there
had
been
no
finding
that
it
was
false,
misleading,
or
deceptive.
i
think
we
can't--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
but
this
letter
is
sent
to
people
whose
homes
are
being
foreclosed
on.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
i
mean,
that's--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
--it
is
my
view
that
the
false,
misleading,
and
deceptive
rubric
has
to
be
judged
in
context;
and
we're
talking
in
the
context
of
a
letter
coming
from
an
attorney,
so
obviously--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
--and
i
am
suggesting
that
under
those
circumstances,
a
letter
coming
from
an
attorney
might
be
judged
somewhat
differently
than
a
letter
coming
from
the
soap
company.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
somewhat
higher
standards,
depending
upon
what
the
context
of
the
letter
is.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
it
is
my
view
that
that
is
not
the
issue
before
the
court
here--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
--in
this
case.
but
it
is
my
view
that
the
ohralik
decision
involved
a
specific
set
of
facts
in
that
case,
and
telephone-targeted
solicitation
would
depend
on
the
facts.
i
do
not
believe,
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
overbreadth
doctrine
that
ohralik
means
all
types
of
in-person
solicitation
could
be
banned.
i
think
it
depends
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
that's
what
the
court
has
held
in
some
of
the
other
decisions.
so
i
don't
agree
that
there
could
be
an
absolute
ban
on
telephone
solicitation.
but
i
don't
believe
the
court
gets
to
that
point
in
this
case.
our
concern
here
today
is
that
we
have
yet
another
example
with
a
bar
association
without
any
fact-finding
whatsoever
simply
banning
a
written
advertisement,
and
holding
in
the
zauderer
case
that
that
can't
occur.
you
have
to
look
at
the
advertisement
and
determine
whether
it's
false,
misleading,
or
deceptive.
we
have
a
three-attorney
panel
that
does
that
in
kentucky;
and
it
should
be
left
to
them.
let
me
point
out
one
additional
thing:
the
kentucky
rules
make
it
very
clear
that
even
if
there
is
a
problem,
as
justice
blackmun
suggested,
maybe
mr.
shapiro
should
have
said,
"is
your
home
being
foreclosed
upon?
"
if
that's
the
kind
of
problem
with
the
shapiro
advertisements,
first
off,
that's
not
a
basis
for
banning
all
targeted
direct
mail
advertisements;
and
second,
it's
not
a
basis
for
banning
mr.
shapiro's
advertisement,
because
under
the
specific
rule,
before
the
advertising
commission
takes
the...
goes
to
capital
punishment,
it's
required,
in
essence,
to
consider
modifications
of
the
language
of
the
advertisement,
the
insertion
of
disclaimers.
for
example,
to
answer
your
concern,
they
might
suggest
a
disclaimer
that
not
all
people's
homes
have
been
foreclosed
upon.
i
mean,
i
can't--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
yes,
the
rule...
yes,
justice
white,
the
rule
bans
anything
you
say
in
writing
that's
in
the
mail
targeted
to
a
person
that
you
know
has
a
specific
legal
problem.
so
you
still
have
the
ban
in
place,
which
i
thought
was
removed
in
the
zauderer
decision.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
rule
7.3.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
those
have
not
been
brought
to
my
attention.
the
kinds
of
factual...
in
the
comments
to
rule
7.3,
one
of
the
prime
reasons
why
the
aba
rejected
the
pre-submission
process
appeared
to
have
been
the
argument
there
that
some
were
saying,
"well,
wouldn't
pre-submission
address
these
problems?
"
and
the
aba's
comments
say,
"well
no,
it's
too
difficult...
the
agencies
would
be
too
busy
and
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
go
through
these
advertisements.
"
"that's
certainly
not
been
the
experience
in
kentucky.
"
this
commission's
been
around
for
six
years;
and
in
their
decision,
now...
we've
got
to
look
at
the
advertising
commission
of
the
kentucky
bar
association.
they
believed
and
recommended
that
the
kentucky
bar
association
delete
this
rule
they
were
enforcing
because
they
felt
it
was
unconstitutional
under
zauderer;
that,
incidentally,
that
was
the
position
of
the
american
bar
association
advertising
commission;
and
the
american
bar
association
ethics
commission;
and
the
department
of
justice
anti-trust
division;
and
the
federal
trade
commission.
so
all
of
the
agencies
that
have
looked
at
this,
except
the
trade
associations,
the
lawyer
trade
associations,
have
in
essence
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
unworkable.
and
unconstitutional.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
they
came...
the
advertising
commission,
i
think,
had
two
concerns.
the
kentucky
advertising
commission...
remember,
they
were
the
people
who
administer
this
on
a
day-to-day
basis...
it
seems
to
me
if
they
had
a
concern
about
the
workability
of
the
system,
they
would
have
expressed
it.
but
i
will
concede
that,
for
the
most
part,
those
administrative
agencies
who
looked
at
the
issue
have
emphasized
more
this
court's
what
i
think
is
clear
holding
in
the
zauderer
decision.
yes,
that
is
correct.
but
the
important
point
is
that
the
people
who
would
be
administering
this
have
expressed
no
fact
finding
of
any
problem
at
all.
the
only
fact
finding
that
we've
had
in
this
case,
the
amici
have
come
into
this
court
and
in
their
briefs,
i
think
they
concede
that
this
factual
vacuum
that
we're
acting
on
a
naked
record;
and
so
they
have
attempted
to
after-the-fact
supply
a
factual
basis
for
this
rule
which
is
unsupported
in
the
record;
and
what
they
did
is
they
went
out
and
conducted
what
i
can
only
call
a
"jack-leg
survey".
and
presented
the
results
of
that
survey
to
this
court.
the
survey
was
actually
conducted
after
this
court
granted
certiorari.
but
there's
a
nugget...
there's
a
real
important
nugget
in
the
survey
of
the
florida
bar
association.
and
that
nugget,
i
think
really
addresses
the
concerns
that
everybody
has,
and
that
is,
what
impact
do
these
direct-mail
advertisements
have
on
the
recipients?
and
here's
this
one
nugget,
virtually...
this
is
the
florida
bar
association
in
their
survey,
virtually
no
one
believes...
and
these
are
the
recipients
now,
virtually
no
one
believes
that
direct
mail
advertisements
they
received
from
an
attorney
was
either
intimidating
or
frightening,
or
confusing.
so
the
only
evidence
we
have
in
this
case
before
you,
is
that.
there
is
just
no
other
evidence,
and
i
think
the
kentucky
supreme
court
really
realized
that
because
in
their
decision
they
didn't
purport
to
rely
on
evidence.
their
decision
was
based
on
the
following:
the
serious
potential...
serious
potential,
now...
that
these
kinds
of
advertisements
have
for
the
kinds
of
harm
that
this
court
has
said
could
be
basis
for
a
ban,
they
said
it
was
entirely
possible
that
these
harms
would
result;
and
they
said
it
was
full
of
"the
possibilities".
well,
i
think,
you
know,
it's
possible
the
roof
could
fall
here,
but
it's
not
the
basis
for
our
leaving
the
court
room.
and
i
don't
think
the
possibility
that
someone
may
be
overreached,
or
may
be
misled,
is
the
basis
for
a
blanket
ban.
if
there
is
a
problem
with
an
advertisement,
we--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
--i
would
say
that,
as
to
written
advertisements
you
have
to
look
at
each
individual
advertisement.
i
do
not
conceded
as
a
matter
of
fact
or
law,
that
written
advertisements
are
inherently
deceptive
by
their
very
nature.
nor
do
i
concede
as
a
matter
of
fact
or
law
that
letters
sent
out
to
people
who
have
legal
problems,
are
inherently
deceptive.
i
think
what
this
court
has
said
in
its
prior
opinions
is,
"let's
look
at
them
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
"
mr.
donald
l.
cox
no.
i
don't
believe
that
we
should
get
into
the
least
common
denominator
situation.
i
don't
concede
that
doing
a
survey...
how
would
you
survey
about
advertisements
written
advertisements
in
general?
mr.
donald
l.
cox
no.
no,
i
think
it
is
useful
on
the
other
side.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
i
think
if
it
had
come
out
the
other
way,
then
we'd
be
in
a
problem.
but
it
says,
"virtually
no
one".
so
if
99
percent
of
the
florida
people
had
said
they
felt
intimidated,
overreached,
and
whatever,
then
maybe
we'd
have
a
problem.
but
i
don't
believe
that's
even
a
remote
possibility.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
way
that
you
can
design
a
survey
which
would
survey
for
the...
to
cover
all
possible
written
advertisements.
i
just
don't
think
that's
the
case.
my
view
is
that,
consistent
with
zauderer;
it's
right
there
in
writing,
you
have
to
look
at
each
advertisement
individually,
and
we've
got
a
perfect
process.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
if
on
their
face
are
false,
misleading,
and
deceptive.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
some
cannot
be.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
well,
i
think,
well,
as
the
first
matter
i
asked
that
mr.
shapiro
be
able
to
be
permitted
to
send
out
this
letter,
but
yes.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
right.
the
problem--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
--yes
sir.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
that's
all
i
can
ask,
because--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
--right.
and
that
is
what
has
caused
the
problems
in
the
lawyer
advertising
area.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
i
thought
it
struck
it
down.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
i
believe
it
struck
it
down,
although
i
don't
understand
the
reason.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
they
said
why,
but
i
think
they
misspoke.
they
said
they
were
striking
it
down
in
view
of
zauderer.
i
think
what
they
really
meant
was
they
were
striking
it
down
in
view
of
primus,
because
the
old
rule
had
prohibited
targeted
direct
mail
soliciting
for
both
pecuniary
and
non-pecuniary
gain...
that's
primus
on
all
fours.
in
primus.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
yes
sir.
and
it
is
precisely
the
same...
it
may
be
more
severe
than
the
old
kentucky
rule...
the
only
difference
between
this
rule
and
the
old
kentucky
rule,
is
that
the
old
kentucky
rule,
a
part
of
it
was
unconstitutional
under
primus,
but
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
no
difference
between
the
application
of
7.3
and
the
application
of
the
old
kentucky
rule.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
i
believe
they
struck
it
down
on
purpose
because
they
deleted...
they
put
in
a
pecuniary
gain
requirement.
the
only
thing
that
could
possibly
explain
that
would
be
primus.
but
that's
not
what
they
said.
they
said
in
view
of
zauderer,
and
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
yes
sir.
the
zauderer,
i
mean,
zauderer
says,
i
mean,
i
just
don't
see
how
it
can
be
any
clearer.
zauderer
says
that
an
attorney
may
not
be
disciplined
for
soliciting
legal
business
through
printed
advertising
containing
truthful
and
non-deceptive
information
and
advice
regarding
the
legal
rights
of
potential
clients.
that's
what
dick
shapiro's
doing.
it's
a
written
advertisement.
the
bar
associations
have
come
back
in
with
this
word
game
about
"it's
not
an
advertisement
at
all.
"
"it's
solicitation.
"
and
this
court
in
bigelow
has
made
clear
that
there
is
no
difference.
that
the
issue
is
not
the
label
we
put
on
it;
the
question
is
what
is
going
on.
and
in
that
quote
i
just
read,
it
says,
"an
attorney
may
not
be
disciplined
for
soliciting
legal
business
through
printed
advertising.
"
we
will
concede
that
when
we
send
out
these
letters
we
are
soliciting
legal
business.
we
believe
that
any
time
you
send
out
anything
that's
in
the
nature
of
an
advertisement,
you're
soliciting
legal
business.
so
the
distinction
is
not
the
label
you
put
on
it;
the
question
is,
what
is
it
in
fact?
and
they
keep
going
back
to
the
ohralik
case,
which
is
the
same
defense.
you
would
have
thought
they
would
have
come
up
with
a
new
defense
after
it
was
so
soundly
rejected
in
zauderer,
that
they
go
back
and
say,
"well,
sending
out
letters
is
just
like
in-person
solicitation.
"
and
that
just
doesn't
fly.
that
was
what
was
rejected
in
zauderer.
in
zauderer
this
court
said,
"the
distinction
between
zauderer
and
in-person
solicitation
and
the
written
advertisement
in
zauderer
is
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
the
trained
advocate
there.
"
"no
immediate
yes
or
no.
"
and
most
importantly
from
our
standpoint,
there
is
an
opportunity
in
our
case
for
the
intervention
of
bar
agencies.
that's
one
of
the
factors
in
the
zauderer
decision.
we've
got
a
three-day
hold
period...
three
days
before
anything
can
happen.
during
that
time
this
thing
can
be
edited;
disclaimed;
we
can
have
hearings;
and
most
importantly,
this
thing
can
go
all
the
way
to
the
kentucky
supreme
court
in
one
jump.
if
the
advertising
commission
thinks
there's
a
problem
here
they
can
apply
to
the
kentucky
supreme
court
for
a
restraining
order
to
restrain
publication.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
it's
reported
in
our
brief...
and
our
numbers
differ
from
the
numbers
that
they
reported,
but
it's
around
perhaps
half.
i'm
not
sure...
we
had
gotten
our
figures
out
of
the
aba
service
on
attorney
advertising,
and
so
it's
a
little
clearer,
but
there
is
a
significant
number
that
do
have
the
ban,
and
i
think
most
of
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
it's
contained
in
the
aba
rules.
so
whether
it...
the
question
is,
is
this
case
like
ohralik
or
like
zauderer?
i
think
it's
clearly
like
zauderer
and
r.m.j.,
and
the
other
cases.
in
ohralik,
one
of
the
commentators
said,
"it's
a
lot
easier
to
throw
out....
"
or
one
of
the
commentators
talking
about
this
problem
with
respect
to
ohralik
said
it
would
be
a
lot
easier
to
throw
out
a
letter
than
it
is
a
200
pound
lawyer
sitting
on
your
couch.
and
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction.
we
don't
have
mr.
shapiro
in
their
living
room,
or
if
we're
going
to
make
it
like
ohralik,
we
don't
have
them
in
the
hospital
room.
we
got
a
letter
there
which
says
right
on
its
face,
this
is
an
advertisement.
and
it's
been
pre-reviewed;
it's
been
pre-screened;
everything's
been
checked
out
on
it.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
i
would
like...
i
understand
the
overbreadth
doctrine
and
its
limited
application
in
commercial
speech,
but
i
think
for
the
future
of
attorney
advertising,
the
ban
ought
to
be
struck
down.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
but
i
realize
what
the
law
says.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
we
don't
know
other
than...
all
we
have
is
what's
on
the
face
of
the
letter,
that's
all
we
have.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
no.
yes
there
is,
i
beg
your
pardon.
but
it
does
talk
about
the
possibility
of
bankruptcy.
and
that
would
be
the
legal
advice.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
that's
correct.
but
that's
the
legal
advice:
federal
law
may
permit
you
to
keep
your
home.
also,
this
rule...
prohibiting
targeted
direct
mail
solicitation,
doesn't
make
any
sense.
take
the
zauderer
advertisement:
we
identify
people,
women,
who
have
this
potential
problem,
and
we
send
that
specific
advertisement
to
them,
and
that's
not
permitted
under
this
rule.
take
another
step:
if
we
take
the
shapiro
letter
and
we
send
it
to
everybody
in
hart
county,
kentucky,
everybody
in
hart
county,
kentucky,
even
though
there
are
only
five
people
in
hart
county,
kentucky
who
are
interested
in
getting
it,
then
that's
okay.
what
you're
faced
with
is
a
situation
where
dick
shapiro
can
get
his
message
across
if
he's
willing
to
send
out
this
letter
to
4,995
people--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
--that's
correct.
he
could
modify
it
slightly
in
the
way
that
justice
blackmun
suggested
it.
it...
it,
or
he
could
say,
"if
your
home
is
being
subjected
to
foreclosure,
you
may
want
to
contact
me.
"
mr.
donald
l.
cox
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
on
a
record
where
there's
no
fact
finding
going
the
other
way;
where
there's
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
there
is
any
problem
with
this
letter--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
--i
don't
believe
that
that's
misleading.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
it
is
my
view
that,
if
you...
another
question
that
could
be
asked...
and
i
don't
want
to
answer
the
question
with
a
question;
but
shouldn't
you
say
that...
ask,
whether
the
people
in
there
had
been
the
district
180
days
or
whatever
that
number
is
for
bankruptcy,
and--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
--and
it's
my
view
that
there's...
that
that's
not
demonstrably
misleading.
if
you
require
every
nit
of
the
law
to
be
set
forth
in
every
advertisement,
then
we
won't
have
effective
advertisements.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
well,
we
also
believe
that
eliminating
the
rule
will
provide
a...
there
are
many
good
benefits
from
having
this
kind
of
advertising.
you
remember,
we're
talking
about
an
advertising
that
has
been
pre-reviewed
by
a
state
regulatory
agency
that
has
been
edited
and
will
be
sent
out
only
after
extensive
bar
association
review.
is
it
better
for
people
to
get
legal
advice
on
that
kind
of
information
based...
is
it
better
for
people
to
find
out
about
the
availability
of
legal
services
under
those
circumstances,
or
from
their
next-door-neighbor;
or
in
a
bar;
or
who
knows
where?
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
we're
making
legal
advice
and
advertising
legal
services
that
are
clearly
regulated
by
the
bar
association.
the
other
alternatives
provide
information
about
lawyers
under
situations
which
are
much
less
likely
to
be
truthful
and
non-deceptive.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
they
didn't
say
that.
all
they
said
was
that
they
recognized
that
that
finding
that
there
was
no
finding
to
that
effect
in
the
administrative
agencies
below,
and
then
they
dropped
it.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
without
saying
why?
mr.
donald
l.
cox
that
would
be
my
assumption.
my
assumption...
i
mean,
i
think
the
clear...
if
you
read
the
kentucky
decision...
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
donald
l.
cox
if
you
read
the
kentucky
decision,
it
seems
clear
that
the
supreme
court
banned
this
advertisement
because
it
didn't...
it
was
targeted
direct
mail
advertisement.
they
didn't
ban
it
because--
mr.
donald
l.
cox
--i'm
sorry?
