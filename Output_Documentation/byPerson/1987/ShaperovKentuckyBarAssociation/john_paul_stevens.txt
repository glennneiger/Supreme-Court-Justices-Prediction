justice
stevens
but
mr.
cox,
isn't
it
possible
that
all
three
of
those
agencies,
while
it's
clearly
banned
by
an
existing
rule,
so
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
particular
advertisement
is
misleading.
justice
stevens
and
in
fact,
has
anybody
reviewed
this
particular
letter
under
the
rule
that
was
promulgated
after
the
letter
was
submitted?
justice
stevens
but
they
didn't
tell
us
anything
about
whether
it
was
misleading
or
not,
did
they?
the
kentucky
supreme
court
simply
said
it
was
banned.
banned
by
a
broad
regulation.
justice
stevens
there
is
no
finding
that
way,
but
there
was
no
finding
the
other
way
either.
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled
about
what
you
say,
"everything's
been
checked
out",
because
i'm
not
sure
it
was
checked
out
in
this
case;
and
with
respect
to
this
letter,
and
you're
really
arguing
that
you
want
us
to
approve
this
particular
letter...
you're
not
asking
for
the
general
ban
to
be
struck
down?
justice
stevens
now,
in
this
case--
justice
stevens
--in
this
case
there
is
no
record
or
no
fact-finding
that
explains
things
like
justice
blackmun
raised...
how
did
it
come
to
this
person's
attention?
to
whom
would
this
letter
be
sent?
is
it
just
people
that
he
has
factual
knowledge
about?
because
he
says,
"if
this
is
true",
and
suggests
otherwise...
what
is
the
'free
information
"on
how
he
can
keep
his
home
that
he's
offering?
"
"if
you
hire
him
maybe
he
can
help?
"
"or
is
he
going
to
give
him
free
legal
advice?
"
"we
don't
know
from
the
record
in
this
case,
do
we?
"
justice
stevens
so
you
quoted
from
zauderer;
said
that
written
advertisement
may
include
legal
advice
of
some
kind.
but
there's
no
legal
advice
in
this
letter.
justice
stevens
where
does
it
say
anything
about
bankruptcy?
where
would
the
layman
know
it
said
anything
about
bankruptcy?
it
says,
"federal
law
may
allow
you
to
keep
your
home.
"
and
so
forth.
and
if
i'm
a
layman,
i'm
not
sure
that
means
bankruptcy.
justice
stevens
well,
mr.
cox,
may
i
interrupt
there:
you
said
it
would
be
okay,
but
it
would
false
as
to
all
but
five
of
those
people.
it
says,
"it
has
come
to
my
attention
that
your
home
is
being
foreclosed
on.
"
and
99
percent
of
the
recipients,
it
would
be
a
false
statement.
do
you
think
that's
a
proper
letter?
justice
stevens
but
we're
asked
to
approve
this
letter.
justice
stevens
am
i
correct
in
recalling
that
you
did
not
make
this
argument
in
your
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
stevens
did
you
have
a
problem
under
the
tuttle
opinion?
