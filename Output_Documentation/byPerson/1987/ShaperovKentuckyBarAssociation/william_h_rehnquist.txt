chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
no.
87-16,
richard
d.
shapiro
versus
the
kentucky
bar
association.
mr.
cox,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
the
kentucky
rule
based
on
an
american
bar
association
suggested
rule?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
aba
in
working
on
its
rule,
and
ultimately
promulgating,
did
it
make
any
factual
inquiries
that--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
do
they
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it's
unworkable,
or
that,
in
their
view,
it's
unconstitutional
because
of
our
decision?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
possibility
of
being
overreached
isn't
a
basis
for
a
blanket...
supposing
there
were
evidence
showing
that
something
more
than
a
possibility...
a
reasonable
probability
or
something
like
that?
would
you
still
say
no
blanket
ban?
chief
justice
rehnquist
supposing
the
florida
survey
that
you
refer
to,
which
you
say
was
taken
after-the-fact
and
wasn't
the
base...
and
really
can't
be
the...
supposing
it
had
shown
that,
you
know,
30
percent
of
the
people
felt
intimidated
or
misled,
and
that
had
been
the
basis
for
kentucky's
rule...
would
you
say
that
the
result
was
still
the
same?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
regard
it
as
"nugget",
i
thought?
so
i
thought
perhaps
you
thought
it
was
useful?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
mean,
what
if
it
had
come
out
the
other
way?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
permit
you
to
answer
to
justice
white's
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cox.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
doheny.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
seems
rather
strained
to
me,
because
he
never
knew
about
rule
7.3
until
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
adopted
it.
and
if
7.3
tracks
in
many
respects
the
rule
it
was
attacking,
and
during
the
course
of
the
litigation,
the
authority...
the
body
with
the
authority
to
do
so
says,
"well,
now
this
rule
you're
attacking
is
no
longer
in
effect;
but
a
new
rule
is.
"
and
he
has
the
same
complaint
about
that,
doesn't
strike
you
as
rather
highly
a
technical
a
thing
to
have
to
go
back
and
start
all
over?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
chance
do
you
think
a
challenge
would
have
had
in
the
kentucky
supreme
court
after
that
court
had
adopted
the
rule?
and
applied
it?
and
applied
it
to
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
doheny.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases,
no.
87-16,
shapero
against
kentucky
bar
association,
and
no.
87-157,
allied
tube
&
conduit
corporation
versus
indian
head
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
