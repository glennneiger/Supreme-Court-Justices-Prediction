justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fried,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
know
exactly
how
to
interpret
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
do
you
think
that
court
opened
it
up
for
courts
to
determine
in
each
instance
under
102
whether
the
decision
was
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
open
to
the
director
to
protect
himself
from
judicial
inquiry
by
saying
in
effect
that
he
intends
to
give
no
reason?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it
is
correct
that
the
director
intended
to
give
no
reason,
do
you
support
that
aspect
of
the
court's
opinion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
congress
intended
to
preclude
litigation
of
even
constitutional
claims
with
102?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
were
for
example
a
policy
not
to
hire
a
black
or
a
woman
or
something
of
that
kind?
justice
o'connor,
if
the
policy
related
to
hiring
or
promotion,
congress
has
subjected
the
cia,
in
72,
to
title
vii,
so
that
we
would
not
that.
i
think
what
we
are
talking
about
is
termination
of
employment.
and
termination
of
employment
is
a
very
special
matter,
because
if
you
are
an
employee
of
the
central
intelligence
agency,
you
have
access
to
the
most
sensitive
intelligence
information
which
this
country
possesses.
and
the
only
way
to
remove
that
access
is
to
terminate
the
employment.
i
think
that
is
why
such
a
special
emphasis
is
given
to
the
issue
of
termination
of
employment
and
why
it,
in
the
congressional
scheme,
this
is
a
congressional
scheme,
it
stands
on
a
different
footing
from
the
initial
employment
decision
or
even
promotion
decisions.
the
central
intelligence
agency
is
subject
to
title
vii
and
in
fact
welcomes
the
procedures
that
are
involved
because
it
considers
that
those
procedures
in
their
invocation
which
involve
a
considerable
amount
of
internal
review,
maintains
the
kind
of
morale
inside
the
agency
which
they
are
very
anxious
to
have.
but
there
does
come
a
point
where
the
agency
simply
must
be
able,
without
giving
reasons
and
without
triggering
the
kind
of
inquiry,
narrow
as
the
court
said
it
was,
but
wide
as
we
think
it
is,
without
triggering
the
kind
of
inquiry
in
open
court.
why
would
a
title
vii
promotion
suit
involve
any
less
rummaging
around?
i
mean,
one
agent
says
i've
done
a
better
job
on
my
covert
assignments,
and
i
can
prove
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lynch,
if
this
had
been
a
case
against
the
national
security
agency
or
the
cia
by
an
employee
there,
i
take
it
you
concede
that
judicial
review
would
be
precluded?
