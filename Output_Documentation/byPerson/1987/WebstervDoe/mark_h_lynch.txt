mr.
mark
h.
lynch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
only
claim
that
mr.
doe
has
that
survives
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
he
has
an
arguable
constitutional
claim,
if
in
fact
the
agency
has
a
policy
of
discharging
people
on
the
basis
of
homosexual
orientation.
so
the
question
then
is
whether
section
102(c)
of
the
national
security
act
of
1947
precludes
judicial
review
of
that
constitutional
claim.
now,
whether
or
not
the
government
conceded
that
there
could
be
review
of
constitutional
claims,
i
think
they
did
in
the
district
court.
it
is
less
clear
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
whether
they
conceded
it
or
not,
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
that
issue
was
not
litigated,
because
as
the
case
progressed
to
the
district
court,
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
question
was
whether
the
agency
had
followed
its
regulations,
not
whether
it
had
violated
a
substantive
constitutional
prohibition.
so
consequently,
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
precludes
judicial
review
of
a
constitutional
claim
was
not
litigated
below.
at
the
least,
we
think
the
court
ought
to
remand
the
case.
if
it
thinks
that
the
statute
does
preclude
review,
at
the
least
it
ought
to
remand
the
case
for
ventilation
of
the
question
of
whether
congress
can
constitutionally
preclude
review.
however,
we
also
submit
that
the
statute
does
not
preclude
review
of
constitutional
claims.
the
statute
on
its
face
says
nothing
about
judicial
review.
the
legislative
history
says
nothing
about
judicial
review.
what
the
statute
does
say
is
that
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
lloyd-lafollette
act
or
any
other
statute,
the
director,
in
his
discretion,
may
terminate
agency
employees
when
he
deems
it
necessary
and
advisable
for
the
united
states
to
do
so.
now
given
the
fact
that
there
was
not
judicial
review
of
termination
decisions
in
1947,
the
most
plausible
explanation
of
that
language
was
that
congress
was
intending
to
keep
cia
employees
who
had
been
terminated
out
of
the
civil
service
commission,
where
they
were
entitled
to
go
under
the
veterans
preference
act
which
had
been
passed
in
1944.
that
seems
to
be
a
very
plausible,
rational
congressional
expectation.
the
cia,
after
all,
in
the
beginning,
in
1947,
was
going
to
be
heavily
populated
with
veterans
in
the
office
of
strategic
services.
they
were
veterans.
without
this
statute
they
would
be
able
to
go
to
the
civil
service
commission
to
contest
the
director's
termination
decisions.
and
it
is
quite
plausible
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
prevent
that.
but,
since
there
was
not
judicial
review
of
any
termination
decisions
at
that
point,
it
seems
to
me
impossible
to
say
that
congress
intended
to
preclude
review
in
1947.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
not
that
early.
i
think
the
back
pay
act
came
along
a
little
later.
i
do
not
know
the
precise
year
but
my
understanding
is
that
there
was
no
review
at
all
in
1947.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
there
is
also
the
question
whether
the
statute
precludes
review
of
agency
regulations.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
non-constitutional
claims.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
our
position
is
that
it
does
not.
in
fact,
the
government's
position,
stated
at
page
18
of
their
reply
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
the
statute
does
not
preclude
review
of
actions
alleging
that
the
agency
has
failed
to
follow
its
regulations.
they
accept
the
rule
of
service
v.
dulles
and
vitarelli
v.
seaton,
that
they
have
to
follow
their
own
regulations.
they
also
accept
the
fact
that
you
get
review
of
personnel
decisions
under
title
vii,
short
of
termination.
mr.
fried
does
not
really
concede
it
but
he
suspects
that
if
there
were
certain
kinds
of
constitutional
claims,
this
court
would
also
grant
review.
i
might
also
say
that
another
provision
of
the
national
security
act
of
1947
which
mr.
fried
neglected
to
discus
is
the
cia
information
act
of
1984,
which
is
an
amendment
to
the
national
security
act
of
1947.
that
statute,
which
was
passed
after
the
sims
decision,
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
agency
is
subject
to
judicial
review
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
so
in
many
respects,
the
agency
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
now,
in
view
of
the
lack
of
any
textual
support
for
preclusion,
any
legislative
history
support,
what
the
government
is
really
arguing
is
that
the
congress
must
have
insulated
this
very
sensitive
agency
from
judicial
review.
but
as
i
have
just
pointed
out,
in
a
number
of
other
significant
respects,
the
agency
clearly
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
so
this
"rummaging
around"
argument
does
not,
with
respect,
hold
water.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
that
is
why
it
is
so
important
to
focus
on
the
solitary
constitutional
issue
that
is
at
stake
here.
even
if
section
102(c)
met
the
standards
of
either
section
701(a)(1)
or
(a)(2),
for
preclusion,
even
if
it
did,
and
i
do
not
think
it
did,
but
even
if
it
did,
that
would
not
preclude,
that
would
not
resolve
the
question
of
whether
a
constitutional
claim
is
precluded.
because
quite
apart
from
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
exemptions
to
the
administrative
procedure
act,
people
who
are
directly
injured
by
the
unconstitutional
action
of
an
executive
agency
officer
can
get
review
of
that
claim
in
the
courts.
you
need
a
statute
that
very
clearly,
and
very,
very
clearly
sets
forth
an
intent
to
preclude
review
of
a
constitutional
claim.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
i
understand
that
is
the
question
they
have
written.
but
given
the
posture
of
the
case--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--yes,
but
you
cannot
change
the
posture
of
the
case,
judge.
the
only
issue
that
is
left
in
this
case
is
a
constitutional
claim.
now,
whether
section
702
meets
the
standards
of
section
701,
you
still
have
that
constitutional
claim.
i
think
the
way
the
government
justifies
its
phrasing
of
the--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--that
is
true,
but
you
still
have
to
deal
with
the
cases
as
they
come
up
here.
i
think
the
way
the
government
justifies
the
way
it
has
phrased
the
petition
is
that
they
seem
to
argue
that
the
apa
can
withdraw
jurisdiction
to
review
constitutional
claims.
that
again
is
another
issue
that
was
never
litigated
below.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
proposition
is
plainly
incorrect.
congress
cannot
in
the
apa,
or
it
did
not
in
the
apa,
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
to
hear
claims
by
individuals
that
their
constitutional
rights
were
violated.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
yes,
but
you
have
to
go
back.
if
you
go
back
to
page
47a,
which
is
section
c-2
of
the
opinion,
there
the
court
sets
out
the
only
claim
that
doe
has
left.
and
that
is
whether
a
policy
to
discharge
people
on
the
basis
of
homosexual
orientation
would
violate
the
constitution.
then,
at
the
bottom
of
that
section,
the
court
says
at
the
very
least,
cia
would
have
to
justify
why
such
a
ban
on
employment
of
all
homosexuals
was
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
27a.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
so
what
judge
edwards
did,
in
writing
the
opinion,
was
say
that
to
satisfy...
if
there
is
this
policy,
based
on
homosexual
orientation,
in
order
for
the
director
to
justify
the
burden
on
an
arguably
protected
constitutional
interest,
the
cia
would
have
to
demonstrate
that
it
was
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
to
have
that
policy.
but
his
invocation
of
those
words
from
the
statute
is
directly
in
the
context
of
setting
out
the
constitutional
claim.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
we
do
have
such
an
allegation
in
our
complaint,
justice
stevens.
but
what
happened
was--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--in
the
section
called
12
and
13.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
there
we
say
that
termination
on
the
basis
of
homosexuality
violates
the
constitution.
you
are
going
directly
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
policy.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
we
don't
know.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
the
record
is
in
conflict
and
that
is
why
judge
edwards
sent
it
back
for
further
development
of
the
facts.
when
doe
told
the
security
officer
the
very
first
day
that
he
was
homosexual--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--first
the
security
officer
said
there
apparently
was
a
per
se
rule
and
then
the
deputy
general
counsel
said
no.
the
question
is
simply
in
dispute
and
that
is
the
reason
for
judge
edwards
reading.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
there
is
a
lot
of
merit
in
what
you
say,
judge.
we
were
going
on
substantially
different
grounds.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
we
did.
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
pull
out
of
the
fire
this
one
constitutional
claim
that
we
can
go
back
and
litigate.
we
did
not
do
very
well
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
for
sure.
we
pulled
our
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire,
so
to
speak.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
that
is
a
reasonable
extrapolation
of
the
statistics
on
the
population
at
large.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
i
would
have
thought
that
the
court
would
have
declined
certiorari
on
that
ground
as
well.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
it
still
could.
and
i
wish
you
would.
let
me
address
the
question
of
whether
despite
the
lack
of
statutory
or
textual
preclusion,
you
can
draw
from
the
structure
and
purposes
of
the
statute
an
intent
to
preclude
review.
first
of
all,
the
cases
of
this
court
that
apply
that
doctrine,
that
you
can
look
at
the
details
of
a
legislative
scheme
to
infer
an
intent
to
preclude
review
are
as
in
block
v.
community
nutrition
institute,
something
like
the
milk
marketing
order
program,
or
in
the
commercial
food
workers
union
case
decided
last
month,
the
very
scheme
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
providing
for
when
review
of
certain
orders
can
be
taken,
and
it
also
provides
that
certain
orders
cannot
be
reviewed.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
that
there
was
an
unconstitutional
policy?
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
no.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
that
is
my
position.
let
me
be
more
subtle
about
it.
the
apa
provides
for
review
of
agency
actions
that
are
unconstitutional,
but,
if
for
any
reason
review
of
that
question
under
the
apa
is
not
available,
you
still
can
get
review
because
the
apa
does
not
preclude,
and
in
this
case
no
other
statute
does
as
well,
preclude
review
of
the
constitutional
claim.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
we
have
three
kinds
of
claims.
first
we
said
that
the
agency
failed
to
follow
its
own
regulations.
the
district
judge
agreed
with
us,
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
i
would
think
so.
but
the
government
concedes
that
we
get
review
of
that
question.
page
18
of
their
reply
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
say
we
concede
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
but
if
that
is
an
apa
claim,
justice
scalia,
i
do
not
see
how
that
concession
squares
with
their
position
that
review
is
precluded
through
section
701.
it
is
another
one
of
the
inconsistencies
in
the
government's
position.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
but
the
point
is,
if
review
is
precluded
under
the
apa,
review
is
precluded.
i
don't
think
you
can
split
up
your
claim
sunder
the
apa.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
i
am
the
first
one
to
agree
that
this
opinion
is
written
rather
strangely.
i
think
mr.
fried
and
i
are
at
least
in
agreement
on
that.
you
see,
my
point
is,
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
come
out
the
other
way
on
the
question
of
the
apa
preclusion,
we
would
still
have
review
of
the
regulations,
although
that
was
decided
adversely
to
us
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
we
would
still
have
review
of
the
constitutional
claim.
so
i
agree
a
lot
of
that--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--our
position
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
provided
by
section
1331;
and
under
davis
v.
passman,
when
you
have
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
you
can
proceed
directly
under
section
1331
even
if
there
is
no
other
statute
specifically
providing
for
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
precisely.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
unless
you
have
the
kind
of
statute
that
this
court
has
not
yet
propounded,
which
is
so
clear
in
its
intent
to
preclude
review
of
a
constitutional
claim
that--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--i
do
not
believe
a
constitutional
claim
by
an
individual
directly
injured
by
the
unconstitutional
action,
allegedly
unconstitutional
action
of
an
executive
officer.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
yes.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
it
is
both
an
apa
case
and
it
is
a
non-apa
case.
because
even
if
review
is
precluded
under
the
apa,
we
can
still
bring
the
constitutional
claim.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
even
if
there
is
sovereign
immunity.
sovereign
immunity
does
not
bar
claims
against
an
individual
agency
official
that
he
violated
the
constitution.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
basically,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
position
that
you
are
putting
forward
is
in
amending
section
702,
congress
resurrected
obstacles
of
sovereign
immunity
that
this
court
had
removed
in
cases
against
individual
officers.
you
were
deeply
involved
in
that
statute.
i
can't
believe
that
that
was
what
congress
was
intending.
i
was
talking
about
the
difference
between
this
statute
and
the
kinds
of
statutes
that
have
been
found
in
their
structure
to
infer,
where
an
intent
can
be
inferred
from
the
structure
of
the
statute,
that
review
is
precluded.
and
i
was
making
the
point
that
milk
marketing
orders,
the
complex
scheme
for
which
decisions
of
the
nlrb
can
be
reviewed,
are
entirely
different
from
this
generic
statute.
the
national
security
act
of
1947
did
a
lot
more
than
what
mr.
fried
pointed
out.
it
not
only
created
the
cia,
it
created
the
department
of
defense.
it
combined
the
war
department
and
the
navy
department.
it
took
the
air
force
out
of
the
army
and
set
up
the
department
of
the
air
force.
it
set
up
the
national
security
council.
it
is
generic
legislation
of
the
broadest
kind,
dealing
with
organization
of
government
agencies.
it
is
not
a
detailed
regulatory
scheme
providing
for
review
of
some
kinds
of
actions
but
not
other
kinds
of
actions.
and
for
that
reason,
that
whole
line
of
cases,
the
community
nutrition
institute
and
the
commercial
food
workers
union
case
last
week,
is
inapplicable
in
this
context.
again,
the
government's
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
end,
is
a
policy
argument,
that
the
cia
ought
to
be
immune
from
judicial
review.
there
may
be
merit
in
that
policy.
it
may
even
be
that
in
an
up
and
down
vote
in
the
congress
they
could
prevail
on
that
policy.
but
there
is
no
support,
through
any
conventional
means
of
interpretation,
that
congress
made
that
decision
in
1947.
therefore,
this
court
should
find
this
is
a
statute
which
does
not
preclude
review,
and
certainly
not
review
of
constitutional
claims.
unless
there
are
any
other
questions,
i
think
the
court
has
my
points.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
of
non-constitutional
claims.
i
certainly
do
not
concede
that
those
statutes
have
a
strong
enough
indication
of
an
intent
to
preclude
review
of
constitutional
claims.
but
i
do
concede
that
they
seem
to
preclude
non-constitutional
claims.
the
government
makes
a
lot
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
glaring
inconsistency
between
the
secretary
of
defense
and
the
director
of
central
intelligence.
well,
that
is
another
one
of
their
"congress
must
have
meant",
but
"must
have
meant"
is
not
enough
in
this
context.
there
has
to
be
clear
intention
that
congress
intended
in
1947
to
preclude
review.
and
while
there
may
be
an
anomaly
between
the
extent
to
which
the
secretary
of
defense
is
immune
from
judicial
review
and
the
extent
to
which
the
director
of
central
intelligence
is
immune
from
judicial
review,
that
is
an
anomaly
to
be
resolved
by
congress
and
not
by
this
court,
with
all
respect.
thank
you.
