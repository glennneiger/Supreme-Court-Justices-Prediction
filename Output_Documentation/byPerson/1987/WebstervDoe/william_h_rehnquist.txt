chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
now
in
number
86-1294,
william
h.
webster
v.
john
doe.
general
fried,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
fried,
you
say
that
102(c)
prevents
review
by
the
courts
of
a
claim
that
the
termination
was
accomplished
unconstitutionally.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
discriminated,
or
no
hearing,
something
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
fried.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
lynch.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
not
some
review
under
the
back
pay
act,
over
a
period
of
years?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lynch,
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument,
it
is
not
so
much
that
102(c)
in
so
many
words
insulates
from
judicial
review
but
when
you
apply
it
through
the
apa,
by
reading
the
apa
in
the
context
of
102(c),
you
find
that
there
is
no
judicial
review.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lynch,
let
me
just
read
you
two
sentences
from
page
32a
of
the
government's
appendix
to
the
petition,
which
is
the
first
two
sentences
of
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
majority
opinion.
section
102(c)
terminations
are
subject
to
judicial
review.
because
the
statute
leaves
the
decision
of
whether
an
individual's
employment
should
be
terminated
as
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
largely
to
the
discretion
of
the
director
of
the
central
intelligence
agency,
judicial
review
must
be
deferential.
now,
they
are
not
saying
there
that
it
is
just
constitutional
claims,
it
seems
to
me.
they
are
saying
that
terminations
under
102(c)
are
subject
to
judicial
review.
they
say
it
in
one
sentence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
page?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
27a.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
do
not
need
the
apa
to
get
review
of
your
constitutional
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lynch.
general
fried,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
fried.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
number
86-1294,
webster
against
doe.
section
102(c)
of
the
national
security
act
of
1947
authorizes
the
director
of
the
central
intelligence
agency
in
his
discretion
to
terminate
the
employment
of
any
cia
employee
in
the
words
of
the
statute
?whenever
he
shall
deem
such
termination
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.?
after
respondent,
a
covert
electronics
technician
employed
by
the
cia
voluntarily
informed
the
agency
that
he
was
homosexual,
he
was
discharged
by
the
director
under
section
102.
he
then
filed
suit
against
the
director
in
federal
district
court
alleging
violations
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
of
certain
constitutional
rights.
the
director
argues
here
that
the
relevant
section
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
prevents
judicial
review
under
that
act
of
the
director's
termination
decisions
and
we
agree.
that
section
applies
where
a
statute
is
drawn
in
such
broad
terms
that
in
a
given
case
there
is
no
law
to
apply,
and
the
court
would
therefore
have
no
meaningful
standard
against
which
to
judge
an
agency's
action.
in
the
present
case,
the
section
102
of
the
national
security
act
does
extraordinary
discretion
in
the
director,
allowing
termination
whenever
the
director
deems
it
necessary
or
advisable.
this
broad
deference
precludes
the
federal
courts
from
reviewing
the
director's
termination
decisions
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
however,
we
hold
section
102(c)
does
not
preclude
the
court's
review
over
respondent's
constitutional
claims.
in
a
series
of
earlier
cases,
we
have
required
convincing
evidence
before
finding
that
congress
intended
to
cut
off
federal
court
review
of
constitutional
claims
and
nothing
in
section
102(c)
demonstrate
that
congress
meant
to
preclude
consideration
of
colorable
constitutional
claims
arising
out
of
the
director's
actions
pursuant
to
that
section.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
affirmed
in
part,
reversed
in
part
and
remanded.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
and
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
