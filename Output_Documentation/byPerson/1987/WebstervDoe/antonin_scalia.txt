justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
were
rejecting
that
possibility.
i
thought
you
were
saying
102(c)
does
not
prevent
the
title
vii
lawsuits
for
promotion
but
it
does
prevent
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
they
have
not
terminated
him.
they
just
have
not
promoted
him.
he
says
he
is
entitled
to
a
promotion.
and
you
say
that
a
lawsuit
will
lie.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
say
i
do
not
see
why
that
doesn't
open
up
the
cia
to
the
same
kind
of
probing
that
you
are
objecting
to
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
irrational.
i
would
think
that
you
would
want
to
give
the
individual
more
protection
for
dismissal
than
you
would
for
promotion.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
that
goes,
it
seems
to
me,
though,
not
to...
you
have
been
objecting
to
rummaging
around.
it
seems
to
me
the
rummaging
around
is
going
to
be
the
same
in
both
cases.
now,
i
can
see
a
distinction
between
the
two,
based
not
on
the
rummaging,
but
on
the
fact
that
the
courts
absolutely
have
no
power
to
require
the
director
to
hire
somebody
he
does
not
want
in
his
office.
that
is
a
different
point
from
rummaging.
i
could
see
drawing
the
distinction
between
title
vii
non-firing
cases
and
other
title
vii
case
on
that
basis.
that
is,
the
court
has
the
power
to
prevent
him
from
promoting
someone,
or
from
not
promoting
someone,
but
he
has
absolutely
no
power
to
prevent
him
from
telling
somebody
to
be
gone.
but
that
is
not
what
you
seem
to
be
arguing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
justice
stevens
asked
whether
you
asserted
that
you
were
insulated
from
the
constitution.
was
that
how
you
put
the
question?
and
to
that
question,
as
i
understood
you
brief,
you
are
not
saying
you
are
insulated
from
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
can
be
insulated
from
our
review
without
being
insulated
from
the
constitution,
i
take
it.
the
president,
in
deciding
whether
this
policy
should
be
adopted,
about
homosexual
firing
in
the
cia
certainly
has
to
sit
down
and
think,
does
the
constitution
permit
this,
doesn't
he?
he
could
not
do
it
if
the
constitution
in
his
view
prohibited
it,
could
he?
i
thought
your
brief
said
you
are
bound
by
the
constitution,
but
your
judgment
in
this
narrow
area
of
the
cia
is
final,
as
opposed
to
our
judgment
being
final,
where
it
normally
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
theory,
that
they
just
used
it
to
keep
it
out
of
the
civil
service
commission
review,
that
would
not
just
apply
to
constitutional
claims.
why
does
that
lead
to
a
conclusion
at
least
that
only
constitutional
claims
can
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--non-constitutional
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
position
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
question
presented
here,
and
maybe
it
is
a
broader
question,
but
i
thought
the
question
presented
was
whether
judicial
review
is
available
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
5
u.s.c.
section
701?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
is
the
question
we
accepted
certiorari
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
one
of
the
nice
things
about
being
on
this
court
was
we
only
had
to
answer
the
questions
we
decided
to
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
claim
here?
was
it
brought
under
the
apa
only
or
under
other
statutes
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
an
apa
claim,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
right.
because
they
concede
that
you
are
entitled
to
review
of
the
procedures
of
the
decision
on
national
interest
in
dismissing
the
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understood
their
position
to
be
review
of
the
substance
of
it,
not
review
of
whether
the
procedures
to
which
the
individual
is
entitled
have
been
complied
with.
that
is
what
i
thought
their
brief
was
saying.
but
i
guess
the
solicitor
general
can
tell
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
review
of
what
is
precluded?
review
of
one
thing
may
be
precluded
and
review
of
something
else
not.
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out
is,
what
in
this
court
of
appeals
opinion...
i
thought
that
this
whole
court
of
appeals
opinion
was
an
apa
opinion.
it
discusses
the
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law
the
other
sections
of
the
apa.
i
thought
we
were
just
dealing
with
an
apa
case
and
that
whether
there
is
a
right
to
review
under
some
other
provision
of
the
united
states
code
for
a
constitutional
violation
or
any
other
violation,
we
can
leave
for
another
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
get
review
of
the
constitutional
claim
under
the
apa.
what
else
do
you
get
it
under?
what
had
you
asserted
as
the
bases
for
jurisdiction
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
against
the
united
states,
it
seems
to
me
we
are
getting
into
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity.
you
doubtless
have
an
action
against
the
individual
officer.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
is
not
invoked.
but
there
are
many
who
think
that
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
is
invoked
when
you
require
the
united
states
to
hire
somebody.
especially,
i
would
think,
in
the
cia.
but
that
is
not
like
a
suit
against
an
individual
officer.
and
if
that
is
the
case,
that
sovereign
immunity
is
involved,
then
you
have
to
invoke
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
order
to
get
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
so
you
are
back
in
the
apa.
yes.
after
the
amendment
to
section
702,
there
clearly
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
this
is
an
action,
we
proceeded
in
the
traditional
manner
with
an
action
against
the
agency
official.
but
even
if
we
had
named
the
united
states
as
a
defendant,
under
the
9176
amendment
to
section
702,
sovereign
immunity
would
be
waived.
in
a
suit
under
the
apa,
though.
that
is
an
apa
suit,
where
sovereign
immunity
is
waived.
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out,
is
this
an
apa
case
or
not?
it
smells
to
me
like
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
mr.
gates,
the
acting
director,
or
the
current
director,
can't
hire
this
person
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
the
relief
you
are
requesting
is
not
relief
that
this
individual
can
provide,
unless
you
invoke
the
united
states.
