mr.
fried,
i
am
a
little
puzzled.
they
did
not
intend
to
preclude
it
in
title
vii
actions,
but
then
you
say
only
title
vii
actions
involving
promotions,
but
not
title
vii
actions
involving
discharge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that
question
presented
in
your
certiorari
petition?
you
just
asked
about
review
pursuant
to
the
apa,
i
thought.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
don't
have
a
question
presented
as
to
whether
there
can
be
a
title
vii
action
or
a
federal
question
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you
are
saying
though
is
your
broad
position
is
that
even
if
the
agency
had
a
policy
of
just
hiring
born
again
christians
and
for
religious
reasons
they
thought
they
were
the
only
appropriate
agents
to
hire,
that
could
not
be
reviewed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
terminated
everybody
who
wasn't
a
born
again
christian.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure,
they
hired
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
they
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
it
be
judicially
reviewable?
that
is
what
i
am
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
it
is,
but
assuming
a
policy
of
denying
employment
to
homosexuals
was
unconstitutional,
why
would
the
review
issue
be
different
than
denying
employment
to
anyone
who
is
not
a
born
again
christian?
justice
john
paul
stevens
terminating.
sure.
you
have
a
change
of
administration.
the
prior
administration
hired
all
these
people.
the
new
administration
comes
in
and
says
we
just
don't
think
we
want
anybody
except
born
again
christians
and
no
homosexuals.
if
it
is
unconstitutional
to
do
that,
you
seem
to
concede
it
would
be
reviewable
on
the
religious
issue
but
not
on
the
other
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
might
be
pressed
to
find
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
puzzled
by
the
footnote
that
your
opponents
have
on
page
16
of
their
brief
about
the
quotes
from
the
district
court
where
the
government
lawyers
seem
to
say
that
they
were
not
asserting
that
the
director
protected
them,
insulated
them
from
the
constitution.
but
you
seem
to
say
they
are.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lynch,
can
i
ask
you
a
question.
i
don't
find
in
your
papers
any
square
allegation
that
there
is
such
a
policy
or
that
you
ever
challenged
it.
basically,
you
seem
to
be
challenging
the
procedures
that
were
applied
in
your
client's
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
the
issue
that
judge
edwards
says
is
the
only
thing
you
can
litigate
was
ever
raised
by
you
in
the
district
court.
i
don't
think
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
a
lot
of
your
allegations,
your
stipulation
of
uncontested
facts,
bring
out
the
fact
that
your
client
was
never
advised
that
there
was
any
requirement
about
homosexuality.
they
did
not
ask
him,
they
did
not
have
any
regulations
prohibiting
it,
all
sorts
of
things
that
seemed
to
indicate
there
was
no
such
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
deputy
general
counsel
said
we
don't
have
any
such
per
se
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
it
is
in
dispute,
but
i
don't
really
understand
how
you
raise
that
particular
dispute.
that
is
what
i
haven't
been
able
to
find.
i
may
be
missing
something.
it
seems
to
me
that
judge
edwards
raised
that
dispute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
that
on
the
grounds
you
were
going
on,
you
lost.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
if
i
remember
some
of
the
facts
you
have,
you
think
that
about
9
percent
of
the
people
employed
in
the
agency
are
probably
homosexuals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
are
going
to
contend
that
there
is
a
total
policy
of
banning
them
all.
i
don't
understand
this
case.
i
would
have
thought
the
government
would
have
been
happy
with
its
victory,
would
have
gone
back
to
the
district
court
and
filed
an
affidavit
saying
we
do
not
have
any
such
policy
and
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
lawsuit.
i
just
don't
understand
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt.
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
a
claim
that
they
had
such
a
policy
and
so
forth
and
it
was
unconstitutional,
would
you
say
that
was
a
claim
for
review
under
the
apa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
issue
that
is
left
in
the
case
is
not
one
embraced
within
the
question
presented
by
the
certiorari
petition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
fried,
is
anything
in
the
record
suggesting
there
is
such
a
policy?
