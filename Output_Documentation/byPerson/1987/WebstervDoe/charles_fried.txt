mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
director
of
the
central
intelligence
agency
dismissed
from
his
employment
doe,
who
had
been
employed
in
the
agency
for
some
nine
years.
at
the
time
he
was
dismissed,
he
held
a
covert
position
as
an
electronics
technician.
in
january
of
the
year
in
which
he
was
dismissed,
he
voluntarily
informed
security
officials
that
he
was
a
homosexual;
and
after
considerable
inquiry,
negotiation
and
discussion,
in
may
of
that
year
he
was
informed
that
the
director
of
central
intelligence
had
decided
to
terminate
his
employment
pursuant
to
section
102(c)
of
the
act,
which
speaks
of
termination
with
the
director
deems
that
such
action
is
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interests
of
the
united
states.
doe
brought
suit,
seeking
reinstatement
or
reconsideration
of
the
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
were
no
procedural
defects
in
the
procedures
below,
but
did
state
that
there
was
unclarity
about
the
basis
for
the
director's
action.
it
was
possible,
in
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
that
doe
had
been
dismissed
pursuant
to
a
general
policy
of
dismissing
all
homosexual
employees.
again,
they
found
further
unclarity
there.
to
the
extent
that
such
a
policy
dealt
with
employees
who
had
engaged
in
homosexual
activities,
which
doe
had
stated
he
had
since
the
year
1976,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
the
matter
was
foreclosed
by
circuit
precedent
in
the
case
of
dronenburg
v.
zech.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
possible
that
doe
had
been
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
a
general
policy
for
dismissing
all
employees
with
a
homosexual
orientation.
and
in
that
event,
it
became
incumbent
upon
the
agency
to
explain,
in
the
court's
words,
"at
the
very
least",
why
such
a
policy
was
necessary
and
advisable
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded,
of
course,
that,
to
the
extent
that
these
questions
must
be
pursued
in
the
district
court,
that
review
was
not
precluded
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
by
section
102(c).
it
has
been
our
position
in
all
courts
and
it
is
our
position
today
that
section
102(c)
of
the
national
security
act
of
1947,
which
sets
up
the
central
intelligence
agency,
precludes
judicial
review,
under
the
apa,
of
this
question.
it
is
important
at
the
outset
i
think
to
have
a
sense
of
the
structure
of
the
1947
act
as
a
whole.
it
is
quite
a
short
statute.
it
is
a
statute
which
establishes
the
agency.
the
first
provision
says
there
shall
be
a
central
intelligence
agency
and
a
director
and
a
deputy
director,
and
then
goes
on
to
say
what
will
happen
if
the
director
is
a
member
of
the
military.
the
next
section,
which
is
subsection
(c),
the
one
in
question
here,
which
is
the
very
first
substantive
section
of
the
act,
states
that,
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
section
751,
or
the
provisions
of
any
other
law,
the
director
of
central
intelligence
may,
in
his
discretion,
terminate
the
employment
of
any
officer
or
employee
of
the
agency
whenever
he
shall
deem
such
termination
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interests
of
the
united
states.
that
is
the
first
substantive
section
of
the
act
setting
up
the
agency.
the
next
section,
the
very
next
section,
sets
out
the
powers
and
duties
of
the
director
and
the
agency,
and
that
section
contains
the
provision
which
was
the
subject
of
this
court's
recent
decision
in
cia
v.
sims.
it
is
that
section
which
states
that
the
director
of
central
intelligence
shall
be
responsible
for
protecting
intelligent
sources
and
methods
from
unauthorized
disclosure.
in
our
view,
these
two
sections
are
really
flip
sides
of
each
other,
that
the
general
injunction
upon
the
director
to
protect
the
intelligence
sources
and
methods
of
the
united
states
implies,
and
then
that
it
has
set
out
the
specific
duty
to
protect
the
integrity
and
security
of
the
cia
work
force.
it
seems
to
us,
further,
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
cia
v.
sims,
which
dealt
with
the
latter
provision,
sets
the
tone
and
sets
the
context
for
the
consideration
of
the
case
here.
in
the
sims
case,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
same
court
of
appeals
as
decided
this
case,
while
recognizing
the
very
special
and
delicate
position
of
the
agency,
went
on
to
give
that
provision
what
this
court
described
as
a
"crabbed
interpretation",
an
interpretation
which
would
allow
a
considerable
amount
of
what
i
would
call
rummaging
around
in
the
business
of
the
agency
in
litigation,
through
deposition,
through
discovery,
through
testimony,
document
production,
and
the
like.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
it
certainly
did.
what
the
court
said
was
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
the
firing
was
on
the
basis
of
a
general
policy
relating
to
employees
with
a
homosexual
orientation.
therefore,
it
was
open
for
district
court
to
inquire
what
the
policy
is.
and,
justice
o'connor,
it
is
not
sufficient,
i
suppose,
once
you
get
into
litigation,
for
the
agency
simply
to
say
well,
we
have
no
such
policy.
because
the
litigant
can
say,
yes,
you
do,
and
let's
have
a
lawsuit
about
that.
mr.
charles
fried
the
court
of
appeals,
in
one
of
the
more
mysterious
aspects
of
its
decision,
said
that
if
the
director
intended
to
terminate
the
employment
without
giving
a
reason,
that
that
would
be
all
right.
but
if,
however,
he
was
terminating
the
employment
on
the
basis
of
this
policy,
that
would
trigger
the
responsibility
of
the
director
to
explain
at
the
very
least
why
his
decision
and
that
policy
was
necessary
and
advisable.
therefore,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
is
open
to
a
persistent
litigant
in
every
case
to
say
you,
director,
did
not
intend
to
give
reasons,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
nonetheless,
you
acted
under
a
general
policy
and
now
we
think
that
policy
is
unconstitutional
and
you
must
at
the
very
least
explain
why
it
is
advisable.
mr.
charles
fried
i
would
be
very
happy
to
rest
content
with
that,
except
i
don't
know
what
it
gives
me.
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
buying
an
empty
bag
there,
because
the
court
of
appeals,
while
it
acknowledge
that
possibility,
i
don't
think
would
have
been
content
with
a
simple
statement
that
that
is
what
we
intend.
indeed,
it
is
a
little
hard
to
know
how
the
director
could
have
more
clearly
indicated
that
he
was
not
putting
forward
reasons,
and
inviting
inquiry
into
the
basis
of
his
action,
because
what
he
stated
was
that
he
is
terminating
the
employment
because
he
deems
it
necessary
and
advisable.
now,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
about
as
good
a
way
as
any
to
say
i
don't
want
to
give
any
further
reasons.
and
yet,
the
court
of
appeals
said
well,
let's
rummage
around
a
little
bit
more
to
see
what
we
come
up
with.
and
that
is
what
i
think
is
intolerable.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
i
do.
that
has
been
our
position
right
along
and
that
is
certainly
our
position
here
today.
mr.
charles
fried
there
are
a
number
of
very
important
reasons.
there
is
confession
and
there
is
avoidance,
justice
scalia.
certainly
what
is
involved
in
title
vii
is
a
requirement
to
go
to
the
agency
and
to
pursue
internal
remedies
there.
and
the
fact
that
there
have
been
a
handful,
literally
a
handful...
well,
seven;
i
suppose
that's
a
hand
and
part
of
a
second
hand...
of
those
cases
filed,
since
1972,
indicates
that
the
internal
procedures
take
care
of
the
matter.
now,
you
can
have
the
lawsuit.
the
important
thing
is
that
that
lawsuit
itself
might
be
trumped
by
102(c).
and
it
is
important
to
keep
that
possibility
open.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
there
would
be
the
promotion
and
perhaps
there
might
be
damages
paid,
but
if
it
was
determined
that
this
person
no
longer
is
somebody
with
whom
the
agency
is
comfortable
as
somebody
with
access,
then
they
could
terminate
that
employee.
mr.
charles
fried
it
will
lie.
there
is
no
question
that
it
will
lie.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
it
does,
but
that
is
congress'
decision.
we
are
saying
that
congress
made
quite
a
different
decision
as
to
the
termination
of
employment.
and
i
think
that
is
a
rational
line
to
draw.
mr.
charles
fried
the
person
who
is
interested
in
pursuing
a
promotion
claim
is
a
person
who
is
interested
in
working
within
the
agency
and
who
the
agency
it
interested
in
keeping
on
in
some
capacity
or
another.
that
person,
on
both
sides
of
the
transaction,
is
still
as
it
were,
part
of
the
family.
when
you
have
a
termination
matter,
you
have
a
person
who
at
least
one
side
of
the
relationship
wishes
to
sever
entirely.
that
is
just
a
balance
which
was
struck
by
the
congress.
it
is
also
worth
noting
that
title
vii
lawsuits
involve
particularly
serious
and
traditionally
particularly
important
constitutional
rights.
if
congress
decided,
which
it
has,
that
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age,
sex,
race,
are
forms
of
discrimination
which
are
simply
intolerable,
then
that
is
a
conclusion
which
we
must
bow
to.
this
is
not
a
constitutional
argument
we
are
making.
mr.
charles
fried
if
the
courts
have
the
power,
as
the
circuit
court
here
asserted,
to
tell
the
director,
you
may
not
tell
someone
to
be
gone,
then
what
follows
is
the
mischievous
rummaging
which
concerns
us.
now,
there
is
no
doubt,
the
agency
is
going
to
be
subject
to
lawsuits
in
a
variety
of
areas.
congress
did
not
say
everything
the
agency
does,
whatever
it
might
be,
and
to
whomever
it
may
do
it,
is
absolutely
precluded
from
review.
and
my
argument
should
not
be
taken
as
asserting
that.
what
i
am
asserting
is
that
congress
drew
a
line.
perhaps
the
line
should
have
been
drawn
somewhere
else,
as
a
matter
of
policy.
but
congress
drew
the
line
where
it
drew
it.
and
we
are
saying
that
where
it
has
drawn
that
line,
it
should
be
respected.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
while
it
gave
a
tip
of
the
that
to
the
important
policies
there,
in
effect
authorized
the
most
extensive
kind
of
inquiries.
and
that,
we
think,
is
what
congress
intended
to
preclude
in
102(c),
though,
to
be
sure,
they
did
not
intend
to
preclude
it
in
respect
to
title
vii
actions.
so
be
it.
that
is
congress'
decision.
but
here
we
have
the
executive
and
the
congress
lined
up
together,
rather
firmly,
for
the
proposition--
mr.
charles
fried
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
fried
no.
we
do
not,
in
this
case.
i
was
endeavoring
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question.
mr.
charles
fried
no,
that
is
not
my
position.
102(c)
refers
to
termination.
mr.
charles
fried
they
would
have
to
hire
them
first.
mr.
charles
fried
that
would
strike
me
as
very
peculiar.
mr.
charles
fried
if
they
did
it,
i
think
they
would
be
in
very
hot
water
of
all
sorts.
mr.
charles
fried
it
is
my
position
that
it
would
not.
mr.
charles
fried
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
court
would
be
pressed,
and
i
think
might
very
well
be
tempted,
to
reach
a
different
conclusion
in
that
case,
because
we
have
here
not
one,
but
two
questions.
we
have,
first
of
all,
the
statutory
question:
does
102(c)
preclude
judicial
review?
and
i
am
quite
clear
that
102(c)
would
preclude
judicial
review
even
if
the
claim
were
made
that
they
first
hire
and
then
terminate
all
employees
who
are
not
born
again
christians.
this
court
might
nonetheless
conclude
that
102(c),
as
applied
to
that
circumstance,
is
unconstitutional,
as
applied.
they
might
so
conclude.
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
extreme,
but
perhaps
useful,
ability
to
keep
the
door
unlocked
though
closed
applies
in
this
case
with
these
claims.
mr.
charles
fried
once
again,
it
is
not
a
question
of
denying.
it
is
a
question
of
terminating.
mr.
charles
fried
i
do
not
say--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
am
quite
clear
that
102(c)
expresses
a
congressional
intention
to
preclude
review.
i
cannot
predict
what
this
court
would
say
if
that
claim...
religious
discrimination...
were
brought
to
it
and
the
question
was
whether
102(c)
was
constitutional
as
applied
to
that
claim.
mr.
charles
fried
absolutely
we
are
saying
that.
and
in
our
reply
brief
we
thought
it
important
to
deal
with
that
point
by
reprinting
portions
of
the
colloquy.
our
position
is
that
we
have
been
asserting,
from
the
outset,
that
review
is
precluded,
and,
of
course,
that
such
review
is
constitutional.
now,
at
different
times,
pressed
with
different
questions,
government
lawyers
have
struggled
with
different
aspects
of
that
very
difficult
point.
but
our
position
right
along
has
been
102(c)
precludes
apa
review
of
this
question
and,
as
applied
in
this
case,
it
is
perfectly
constitutional.
we
have
never
receded
from
that
point
and
we
certainly
press
it
here.
mr.
charles
fried
one
is
not
insulated
from
the
constitution,
in
the
sense
that
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
decide
whether
the
review
preclusion
as
applied
to
a
particular
claim
is
constitutional.
we
say
that
it
is.
and
if
we
are
correct,
then
to
that
extent,
the
matter
is
insulated
from
the
constitution
if
that
is
how
one
wishes
to
put
it.
but
you
are
never
insulated--
mr.
charles
fried
--there
is
no
doubt
that
the
director
of
the
central
intelligence
agency
takes
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
and
that
102(c)
is
a
review
preclusion
statute,
not
something
which
says
that
the
director
of
the
central
intelligence
agency
is
somehow
not
subject
to
the
constitution
he
takes
an
oath
to
uphold.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
many
persons
are
insulated
from
judicial
review
of
their
actions.
no
one
is
insulated
from
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
fried
if
i
did,
i
misspoke,
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
fried
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
fried
i
welcome
the
correction,
because
i
would
not
want
to
make
that
assertion.
he
is
not
insulated
from
the
constitution.
he
is
insulated
in
a
very
narrow
area
from
judicial
review
of
his
decisions,
but
he
is
not
insulated
from
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
fried
i
suppose
the
president.
if
the
president
should
terminate
my
appointment--
mr.
charles
fried
--in
some
of
his
decisions
he
is
and
in
some
of
his
decisions...
not
insulated
from
the
constitution,
insulated
from
court
review
of
his
decisions.
mr.
charles
fried
it
is
a
bad
habit,
and
i
should
be
broken
of
it,
justice
marshall.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
hope
i
don't.
mr.
charles
fried
i
would
like
to
say
a
little
bit
about
the
statutory
interpretation
point,
whether
indeed
102(c)
intends
the
very
categorical
insulation
from
judicial
review,
though
not
from
the
constitution,
which
we
assert.
our
point
is
really
quite
a
simple
one,
that
at
different
times,
different
language
is
used
to
accomplish
this.
in
1978,
the
congress
said
that
the
president
may
detain
or
remove
hostile
aliens.
and
in
the
first
case
under
the
apa
the
ludecke
case,
this
court
said
that
was
sufficient
to
preclude
apa
review.
in
1947,
the
language
was
"in
his
discretion".
in
1964,
in
the
act
setting
up
the
national
security
agency,
the
language
is
"in
his
discretion,
and
it
is
final.
"
in
1984,
in
the
statute
setting
up
the
defense
intelligence
agency,
the
language
was
"final
and
shall
not
be
appealed
outside
the
department
of
defense.
"
to
our
minds,
the
language
changes.
the
thought
is
the
same.
the
boilerplate
gets
thicker,
but
it
seems
quite
clear
that
in
1798,
in
1947,
in
1964,
in
1984,
congress
was
seeking
to
accomplish
the
same
result.
if
that
is
not
so,
then
we
have
the
anomaly,
an
anomaly
which
congress
clearly
stated
in
various
reports,
it
did
not
imagine
it
was
facing,
that
the
secretary
of
defense,
in
respect
to
the
defense
intelligence
agency,
or
the
national
security
agency,
has
this
unreviewable
power,
but
the
director
of
the
central
intelligence
agency
does
not.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
not
a
sensible
scheme,
and
it
is
not
the
scheme
which
congress
imagined
it
was
enacting.
if
i
may
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
fried
just
very
briefly,
it
is
quite
clear
the
court
of
appeals
did
make
this
decision
under
the
apa.
it
is
quite
clear
that
they
made
a
decision
which
was
both
statutory
as
well
as
constitutional,
because
they
said
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
required
the
director
to
explain
why
his
action
was
advisable.
that
is
a
statutory
claim.
and
of
course,
the
difference
between
statutory
and
constitutional
claims
is
thereby
pointed
out
because
the
constitutional
claim
is
simply
the
statutory
claim
with
the
addition
of
a
citation.
there
really
is
no
difference.
and
i
think
we
are
not
arguing
about
anything
very
much
if
we
pretend
that
ends
up
making
a
large
point.
the
reason
we
did
not
simply
accept
the
remand
is
because
we
would
have
been
required
to
do
more
than
file
a
letter.
that
letter
would
have
been
the
beginning
of
the
litigation,
and
not
its
end.
we
would
say
there
is
no
such
policy.
mr.
charles
fried
there
is
the
allegation
that
a
security
officer
so
stated.
the
deputy
general
counsel
stated
the
contrary.
and
i
would
have
thought
that
is
more
authoritative.
