mr.
mark
stevens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
jury
instructions
given
pursuant
to
article
37071(b)
of
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure
deprive
the
jury
of
any
procedure
for
considering
and
expressing
the
view
that
the
mitigating
evidence
in
this
case
called
for
the
sentence
of
less
than
death.
this
is
a
case
involving
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances.
this
court
has
held
that
mitigating
circumstances
must
be
rooted
in
the
evidence;
they
must
concern
the
character
of
the
record
and
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
and
the
character
of
the
defendant,
because
those
relate
to
the
mitigating
circumstances
in
this
case.
it
is
absolutely
undisputed
that
mr.
moran
was
killed;
robbed;
kidnapped.
there
were
no
eyewitnesses
to
the
crime
itself,
however.
a
circumstantial
evidence
case,
the
circumstantial
evidence
pointed
to
donald
franklin.
primarily
it
linked
him
to
the
car
in
which
he
was
unquestionably
abducted
in;
there
was
evidence
linking
her
as
well
to
his
house
and
to
the
outside
of
the
house.
so
it
was
circumstantial
evidence
that
pointed
to
mr.
franklin.
still,
there
was
no
physical
evidence
unequivocally
tying
mr.
franklin
as
her
killer.
there
was
no
confession;
there
was
no
inculpatory
statement;
there
were
two
eyewitnesses
who
identified
him
at
the
scene
of
the
abduction;
but
they
were
vigorously
cross-examined
at
trial:
cross-examined
on
their
opportunity
to
observe
the
prior
misidentification
of
one
of
the
witnesses;
their
motive
for
testifying;
and
the
lighting
conditions.
all
in
all
we
don't
complain
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence;
but
we
concur
that
it
was
sufficient
to
prove
his
guilt;
of
intentional
murder
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
we
do
contend
just
as
clearly
that
there
was
some
residual
doubt;
that
the
facts
of
this
case
were
not
so
strong;
not
so
compelling;
to
remove
all
doubt
whatsoever;
and
the
best
evidence
of
that
is
the
fact
that
the
jury
deliberated
for
four
hours
and
forty-five
minutes
before
reaching
its
decision.
the
primary
residual
doubt
concerned
identification;
that
is,
was
mr.
franklin
in
fact
the
one
seen
driving
the
car
away
from
the
scene?
he
was
found
guilty
and
the
court
then
went
into
the
punishment
phase
of
the
trial.
at
the
punishment
phase,
they
presented
four
reputation
witnesses
who
testified
that
mr.
franklin
had
a
bad
reputation
as
a
peaceful
and
law-abiding
citizen;
they
proved
that
he
had
twice
previously
committed
the
crime
of
rate;
and
in
addition
there
was
a
stipulation
that,
in
seven
years
of
imprisonment
he
had
had
a
good
disciplinary
record.
at
this
point,
the
jury
was
retired
to
deliberate.
they
had
to
choose
between
life
and
death
for
mr.
franklin,
and
they
looked
to
instructions
from
the
court.
what
they
got
was
two
questions,
as
is
typical
under
the
texas
capital
punishment
submission
scheme.
the
question
asked
whether
the
crime
was
committed
deliberately
and
with
the
reasonable
expectation
that
death
would
occur.
the
second
question
asks
whether
there
was
a
probability
that
mr.
franklin
would
commit
acts
of
criminal
violence
constitution
a
continuing
threat
to
society?
there
was
nothing
at
all
in
these
questions
that
provided
for
consideration
of
the
mitigating
circumstance
we
just
talked
about.
mr.
mark
stevens
two
questions,
your
honor.
two.
the
texas
scheme
permits
the
submission
of
three
questions
in
some
cases,
but
two
were
submitted
here.
mr.
mark
stevens
your
honor,
what
the
court
said
in
lockett
was
it
is
required
that
the
circumstances
be
relevant.
but
it's
relevant
if
it
goes
to
the
defendant's
character,
record,
or
circumstance
of
the
offense.
i
think
there
can
be
no
more
compelling
circumstance
of
the
offense
than
a
question
about
whether
the
defendant
is
the
one
who
did
it?
so
i
do
think
it
is
relevant.
mr.
mark
stevens
it
goes
to
whether
or
not
he
did
it,
though,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
be
like
a
circumstance
of
the
offense.
the
court
has
never
defined
circumstance
of
the
offense;
but
it
just
seems
like,
especially
in
a
capital
murder
case,
where
the
decision,
where
the
jury
has
to
make
that
decision
of
life
and
death,
there
can
be
no
more
important
circumstance
of
whether
he's
the
one
that
did
it;
whether
they've
got
the
right
man?
this
court
has
recognized
in
addition
to
recognizing
the
right
to
present
evidence
of
the
circumstance
of
the
offense,
this
court
in
lockhart
v.
mccree
recognized
that
residual
doubt
can
be
of
benefit
to
a
defendant.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
just
another
way
of
saying,
if
it
can
be
of
benefit
to
him,
then
it
can
also
can
be
something
that
is
proffered
as
the
basis
of
the
sentence
less
than
death.
mr.
mark
stevens
possibly,
your
honor.
that's
the
argument
the
state
made;
took
the
majority
opinion
to
adopt
that
argument,
to
at
least
say,
and
the
court
said,
that
it
does
not
wholly
vitiate
the
claimed
interest.
and
i
took
the
court
to
say
that
there
is
some
interest
in
residual
doubt
that
accrues
to
the
defendant
in
a
unitary
jury
system.
that
is
a
recognition
by
the
court
that
it
can
be
beneficial;
it's
just
another
way
of
saying
it
can
be
a
mitigating
circumstance...
an
irrelevant
mitigating
circumstance.
mr.
mark
stevens
it
couldn't
affect
the
jury
if
they're
honestly
obeying
their
oath
in
this
case.
the
jury
in
this
case
took
two
oaths:
one
to
render
a
true
verdict
according
to
a
law
and
the
evidence.
the
law
was
submitted
to
the
jury
in
the
form
of
the
special
issues.
the
special
issues
do
not
logically
comprehend
an
inquiry
into
residual
doubt.
it
is
true
the
jury
could
have
nullified
their
verdict;
could
have
been
dishonest;
and
could
have
answered
that
"no"
based
on
residual
doubt.
however,
it
certainly
approaches
"arbitrary
and
capriciousness"
for
a
defendant
to
have
to
rely
on
jury
nullification
in
order
to
save
his
life
and
get
the
verdict
he
ought
to
be
entitled
to
if
the
jury
were
considering
the
evidence.
mr.
mark
stevens
i
think
it's
unquestionably
of
use
to
the
defendant,
your
honor.
it's
of
use
to
the
defendant
and
it
couldn't
be
comprehended
in
this
case.
and
it's
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
punishment
phase
of
the
trial,
that
reasonable
jurors,
when
they
were
deciding
the
guilt
that
they
had,
they
deliberated
almost
five
hours,
that
they
still
have
some
of
this
residual
doubt;
and
it
might
be
such
that
it
could
have
affected
them
in
this
case;
and
yet
there
was
no
way
for
the
jury
to
take
that
into
consideration
under
the
narrow,
special
issues.
and
even
if
they
had
considered
it
for
some
reason
or
other,
there
was
no
vehicle
for
them
to
express
that
view
that
that
was
mitigating
evidence
substantial
enough,
to
have
them
vote
for
a
life
sentence.
because
all
they
could
do
honestly
under
the
special
issues
is
answer
the
questions
yes
or
no.
mr.
mark
stevens
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
believe...
i
do
disagree
with
the
state.
the
state
wasn't
explicitly
instructed
to
consider
all
the
evidence
in
deciding
the
special
issues.
that
instruction
is
typically
given
in
texas,
but
it
was
not
here.
the
closest
the
state
came
to
that
was
in
the
special
issues,
where
the
jury
was
told,
"do
you
find
from
the
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
"
so
we
think
that
the
instruction
was
a
little
bit
less
explicit
than
the
state
would
have
it.
and
it
would
not
satisfy
us
either,
because
even
if
it
did,
even
if
that
did
direct
the
jury's
consideration,
there's
still
that
second
aspect
of
the
problem
with
the
way
the
statute
was
applied
in
this
case.
it
doesn't
give
the
jury
a
vehicle
for
answering
the
question
honestly,
"no".
mr.
mark
stevens
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
stevens
i
do
believe
that
the
jury
was
instructed
to
consider
all
the
evidence...
excuse
me,
to
consider
the
instructions
for
the
previous
part
of
the
trial.
mr.
mark
stevens
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
we
rely
on
lockett
as
our
principal
authority,
but
lockett
was
a
statutory
case.
it
invalidated
a
statute
on
its
face.
we're
not
seeking
to
invalidate
the
texas
statute
on
its
face.
mr.
mark
stevens
i
don't
know
just
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
statute...
what
the
case,
said
was
the
statute
was
so
narrow
that
it
didn't
allow
the
jury...
the
sentencing
judge
to
consider
and
to
give
independent
mitigating
weight
to
the
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
so
i
think
it's
very
close
to
our
case.
it
didn't
allow
consideration;
it
didn't
allow
the
jury
to
give
independent
mitigating
weight
to
the
evidence.
but
it's
not
identical
to
our
case
because
we're
not
attacking
the
statute
on
its
face.
ours
is
a
jury
instruction.
mr.
mark
stevens
no.
but
we
did
request
punishment
instructions,
and
what
those
instructions
would
have
done
would
have
permitted
the
jury
to
consider
all
circumstances
of
the
offense
and
to
answer
"no"
if
a
circumstance
such
as
residual
doubt
mitigated
against
the
punishment
of
death.
that's
our
complaint
with
this
texas
statute.
it's
too
narrow;
our
requested
instructions
would
have
broadened
the
texas
statute;
and
would
have
broadened
it
just
like
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
told
this
court
when
it
decided
jurek
in
1976,
this
court's
decision
in
jurek
was
based
on
a
promise
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
mark
stevens
we
would
be
here,
your
honor,
because
again,
our
problem
is
that,
even
if
the
jury
could
have
considered
all
the
evidence,
there
was
no
procedural
vehicle
for
that
jury
to
give
effect
to
its
consideration.
in
other
words,
the
jury
was
still
bound
by
its
oath
to
answer
the
questions
truthfully
based
on
the
evidence;
so
if
all
the
judge
had
done
was
instruct
the
jury
that
it
must
consider
all
the
evidence,
it
still
would
have
had
no
way
to
answer
the
questions
"no".
assuming
it
found
the
answers
should
be
"yes".
yes,
deliberately;
yes,
probability
but
still
found
a
mitigating
factor,
it
would
have
no
way
to
give
independent
weight
to
that
mitigating
factor;
and
no
way
to
answer
the
question,
"no",
outside
the
narrow
special
issues.
mr.
mark
stevens
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
stevens
it
was
broader
in
respect
that
it
tried
to
bring
the
statute
as
applied
in
this
case
into
compliance
with
lockett.
there
were
two
sorts
of
instructions:
instructions
three,
four
and
five,
told
the
jury
that
they
could,
that
they
may
consider
evidence
concerning
defendant's
character;
record;
or
circumstance
of
the
offense
which,
in
their
opinion
mitigates
against
the
punishment
of
death;
and
if
they
find
that
it
does
mitigate
against
the
punishment
of
death,
they
can
answer
the
questions
"no".
the
first
requested
instruction
was
a
little
bit
different
than
that;
what
it
told
the
jury
was
that
it
may
consider
evidence
of
character;
record;
and
circumstance
of
the
offense
and,
if
that
evidence
leads
the
jury
to
have
a
reasonable
doubt
about
the
true
answer
to
the
special
issues,
then
it
should
answer
that
question,
"no".
so
what
we
tried
to
do
with
our
requested
instruction
was
basically
ask
the
jury
in
every
conceivable
way
the
very
questions
that
we
think
lockett
entitled
us
to.
mr.
mark
stevens
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
frame
the
question
a
little
bit
differently
if
i
could.
our
second
mitigating
factor,
however,
was
related
to
mr.
franklin's
seven
years
of
good
behavior
in
prison.
it's
not
true
and
we
don't
contend
the
jury
was
precluded
from
considering
that
altogether,
because
clearly
his
prior
prison
record
was
relevant
to
the
second
special
issue;
that
is,
whether
he
would
probably
commit
acts
of
violence
in
the
future.
but
lockett
i
think
requires
more
than
just
consideration.
it
requires
a
certain
sort
of
consideration;
in
other
words,
the
jury
must
individually
consider
any
aspect
of
character;
record;
or
circumstance
of
the
offense
proffered
as
a
basis
of
a
sentence
less
than
death.
individual
consideration,
and
furthermore,
it
must
be
allowed
by
the
instructions
and
by
the
statute,
to
give
independent
mitigating
weight
to
that
evidence.
so,
although
the
jury
considered
it,
we
don't
doubt
that
they
did
consider
his
prior
prison
record
when
answering
special
issue
no.
2,
there
was
no
vehicle
for
the
jury
to
give
independent
mitigating
weight
to
that
evidence.
mr.
mark
stevens
but
the
fact
that
the
state
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
specify
the
purposes;
but
i
certainly
don't
think
they
can
specify
the
purposes
to
the
extent
that
they
preclude
giving
independent
weight
to
relevant,
mitigating
factors.
mr.
mark
stevens
it
could
have
come
in
for
limited
consideration.
mr.
mark
stevens
only
for
the
purpose
of
probability.
what
the
state
is
doing;
what
the
state
is
asking
this
court
effectively
to
say,
that
that's
the
only
criteria
necessary
to
decide
whether
a
person
lives
or
dies.
undoubtedly
this
court
has
previously
held
that
that's
one
criterion,
but
that
can't
be
the
only
one.
that
is
the
law
of
texas,
however.
if
the
jury...
whatever
independent
weight
they
want
to
give
to
the
evidence,
they
can't
do
it
under
the
texas
statute.
they
have
to
filter
it
all
through
special
issue
no.
2.
mr.
mark
stevens
the
cases
are
a
little
bit
confusing
to
me.
because
some
cases
say
the
jury
could
consider
it;
and
other
cases
say
the
jury
must
consider
it.
i
believe
that
eddings
and
lockhart
make
clear
that
the
jury
must
consider;
the
jury
must
listen.
it
doesn't
say
what
weight
the
jury
has
to
give
to
that
evidence,
but
they
must
listen.
mr.
mark
stevens
it
gets
back
to
what
i
said
earlier
about
consideration
versus
proper
consideration.
mr.
mark
stevens
i
do
think
there
is
in
lockett.
i
think
that
lockett
told
us
how
that
consideration
has
to
be;
you
have
to
consider
any
relevant
aspect;
mitigating
aspect;
and
we
have
to
give
it
independent
mitigating
weight.
so,
just
consideration,
consideration
as
a
conglomerate
as
texas
requires
it,
the
conglomerate
being
probability,
is
not
enough.
the
jury
must
be
allowed
to
give
that
evidence
independent
mitigating
weight.
mr.
mark
stevens
i
think
it
means
independent
of
any
factors
mitigating
or
aggravating,
and
in
this
case,
in
mr.
franklin's
case,
when
it
was
shown
that
he
had
committed
two
prior
rapes;
when
it
was
shown
that
he
had
a
bad
reputation;
that
was
an
aggravating
factor
as
far
as
probability
of
future
dangerousness
goes.
i
think
that
it
was
unconstitutional
in
this
case
for
a
jury
to
have
to
consider
that
aggravating
evidence
in
conjunction
with
this
mitigating
evidence
in
sort
of
lump
sum,
without
considering
them
independently.
i
think
that
violates
lockett.
mr.
mark
stevens
not
necessarily.
we're
not
asking
a
court
to
overrule
jurek
in
this
case.
what
jurek
said
was
the
texas
statute
properly
narrows
a
category
of
persons
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
it
also
says
that,
if
we
believe
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
then
it
also
provides
for
consideration
of
particularized
mitigating
circumstances.
in
those
cases
in
which
the
texas
statute
allows
for
consideration
in
a
particularized
mitigating
circumstances,
we
have
no
complaint.
we're
here
because
in
our
case,
consideration
of
particularized
mitigating
circumstances,
giving
independent
weight
to
those
independent
circumstances,
was
not
allowed
under
the
facts
of
the
case,
because
of
the
narrow
special
issues.
mr.
mark
stevens
it
did,
your
honor.
but
decided
the
same
day
was
proffitt
v.
florida,
and
gregg
v.
georgia.
since
then,
the
court
has
re-examined
both
those
state
statutes
as
applied.
proffitt
and
the
hitchcock
case
is
a
good
example
of
a
recent
case
out
of
this
court.
when
the
court
decided
hitchcock,
it
didn't
overrule
proffitt.
it
just
said
that
as
we
looked
at
the
case
it
is
clear
to
us
that
the
jury
was
precluded
from
considering
mitigating
circumstances.
so
we
hold
that
the
statute
was
applied
unconstitutionally
in
that
case.
that's
exactly
what
we're
asking
in
this
case.
we
have
demonstrated,
we
believe
in
our
brief,
that
the
jury
was
precluded
from
considering
mitigating
circumstances
in
this
case;
and
as
applied,
the
statute
worked
unconstitutionally.
mr.
mark
stevens
i
don't
think
this
question
was
presented
as
i
read
the
briefs
in
jurek
or
the
decision
in
jurek.
again,
if
particularized
mitigating
circumstances
could
have
been
considered
under
the
facts
of
our
case,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
so
jurek
is
still
good
law
as
far
as
it
goes.
jurek,
though,
is
important
to
remember
that
jurek
was
based
on
a
promise
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals.
the
court
recognized
that
the
statute
was
facially
narrow.
in
order
to
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face,
the
court
looked
to
advice
and
guidance
from
the
texas
court
of
appeals
in
jurek
v.
state,
the
texas
case;
and
was
assured
by
that
case
that
the
court
would
consider
all
mitigating
circumstances.
maybe
it
looked
to
the
court
like
texas
would
keep
its
promise
at
that
time.
however,
it
is
now
clear,
based
on
this
case,
that
texas
has
not
kept
that
promise.
mr.
mark
stevens
even
if
that's
true,
texas
is
still
not
providing
a
procedural
mechanism.
mr.
mark
stevens
no
one
suggested
either
that
you
couldn't
add
that,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
when
you--
mr.
mark
stevens
--i
don't
think
it
does.
i
think
when
you
talk
about
broad
construction,
and
that's
what
the
court
did
in
jurek,
it
talked
about
the
statute
really
being
more
broadly
construed
than
it
is
on
its
face.
there
are
a
number
of
different
ways--
mr.
mark
stevens
--i
don't
know
that
it
was
complied
with.
in
spirit
at
least,
your
honor.
in
lockett,
the
court
talked
about
jurek.
and
they
certainly
didn't
overrule
jurek
in
lockett.
but
they
noted
that
the
statute
was
facially
narrow
and
had
been
broadly
construed
by
the
texas
court.
i
think
that
one
way
to...
it's
a
reasonable
interpretation
that
a
broad
construction
would
be
one
that
properly
allowed
the
jury
to
consider
all
mitigating
circumstances.
our
instructions
would
have
done
that...
the
instructions
given
in
this
case
under
our
facts
did
not
allow
it.
that's
our
complaint.
that's
one
of
our
complaints.
mr.
mark
stevens
we
asked
for
two
sorts
of
instructions
and
that
was
one
of
them.
mr.
mark
stevens
the
other
one,
basically,
i
think
request
no.
1
asked
the
jury
to
consider
mitigating
evidence,
and
if
that
evidence
requires
an
answer
no.
1
or
no.
2,
then
you
can
answer
it
"no".
mr.
mark
stevens
that's
what
we
did,
your
honor.
there
were
two
sets
of
instructions.
one
of
them
is
geared
to
the
special
issues
themselves;
the
other
one
is
really
independent
of
the
special
issues.
mr.
mark
stevens
it
does,
and
we
think
the
effect
is
one
of
making
the
statute
as
applied
constitutional.
it
brings
it
into
compliance
with
what
the
court
held
in
lockett.
mr.
mark
stevens
absolutely
not.
it
did
note
that
the
texas
statute
as
applied
at
the
time
did
note
clearly
preclude
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances.
we
think
that,
as
we
have
shown
in
our
case,
there's
going
to
be
a
case
in
which
the
statute
as
applied
does
preclude
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances
and
does
prevent
the
jury
from
giving
independent
weight
to
those
mitigating
circumstances
and
does
prevent
the
jury
from
giving
independent
weight
to
those
mitigating
circumstances.
in
effect,
what
the
state
is
saying
in
their
brief,
and
their
position
is
that
the
cause
of
the
mitigating
evidence
as
far
as
the
probability
of
his
prison
record
because
that
did
not
negate
the
probability
of
future
violence,
it
should
be
disregarded
entirely.
and
that
is
inconsistent
with
lockett's
mandate
that
it
be
considered
independently.
the
state
says
that
good
behavior
has
no
relevance
apart
from
this
probability
of
future
misconduct.
that's
not
supported
by
the
caselaw.
skipper
v.
south
carolina,
for
one
thing,
says
that
a
good
adjustment
in
jail
is
potentially
mitigating
regarding
petitioner's
character
and
his
probable
future
conduct.
so
skipper
basically
gives
us
two
explicit
mitigating
aspects
of
this
sort
of
evidence.
it
goes
to
his
character
and
his
probable
future
conduct.
we
could
only
rely
on
one
of
them
under
the
narrow
special
issues
here.
here
the
jury...
mr.
franklin
had
the
right
to
have
his
jury
decide
whether
the
strength
of
his
character,
as
shown
by
his
seven
years
of
good
behavior
in
prison,
whether
that
factor
alone,
whatever
it
showed
about
his
probability
of
future
violence,
whether
that
factor
alone
was
strong
enough
to
mitigate
in
favor
of
a
life
sentence?
had
our
instructions
been
granted,
that
could
have
been
done.
it
could
have
been
done
under
the
instructions
actually
given.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
stevens
thank
you.
the
state
faults
us
for
not
arguing
character
had
independent
weight.
that's
the
very
point
of
the
case.
the
basis,
the
framework,
for
an
effective
argument
is
on
proper
jury
instruction.
you
can't
make--
mr.
mark
stevens
--two
types
of
instructions:
one,
consider
the
mitigating
evidence
when
deciding
the
true
answer
of
special
issue
nos.
1
and
2.
the
second
type
of
instruction
asks
the
jury
to
answer
yes
or
no
based
on
whether
or
not
they
thought
the
evidence
mitigated
against
the
penalty
of
death.
mr.
mark
stevens
two...
well,
three,
four
and
five
did
it
exclusively;
and
two
was
a
mixed
instruction.
mr.
mark
stevens
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
stevens
correct,
your
honor.
the
state
wants
to
fault
us
for
not
making
an
argument
that
we
didn't
have...
if
we
didn't
have
the
proper
jury
instructions,
the
argument
could
have
been
made
effective.
mr.
mark
stevens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
so
that's
independent
of
the
true
answer
of
the
special
issues.
i
don't
understand
the
prosecutor
to
say
that
i
requested
instructions
and
misstated
the
law;
or
that
they
were
erroneous
in
any
way.
the
worst
he
can
say
about
them
is
that
they
are
merely
redundant.
they're
clearly
not
redundant,
as
justice
o'connor
has
noted
in
a
concurring
opinion,
when
there's
any
doubt
about
this,
it's
the
duty
of
the
court
to
remove
any
ambiguity
about
whether
the
jury
actually
considered
the
mitigating
evidence.
at
the
very
best,
the
state
can
say
there's
an
ambiguity
here:
the
proper
jury
instruction;
the
one
we
requested
would
have
removed
that
ambiguity.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
