justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
second
statutory
question--
justice
stevens
--that
asks
if
he
would
commit
criminal
acts
that
would
constitute
a
continuing
threat
to
society.
if
what,
if
he's
not
put
to
death,
or
if
he
were
loose
in
society?
has
the
texas
court
ever
answered
that
question?
justice
stevens
it's
if
he's
allowed
to
live,
not
if...
the
words
"continuing
threat
to
society"
made
me
wonder
if
it
was
intended
to
mean
if
he
were
turned
loose
in
society?
justice
stevens
so
that
the
predicate
is,
"if
not
put
to
death",
he
would
do
those
things?
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
may
i
follow
up
on
that?
suppose
the
mitigating
circumstance
was
different
than
the
one
relied
on
here,
and
instead
the
defendant's
counsel
argued
that
he
was
only
16
or
17
years
old
at
the
time
of
the
offense
and
for
that
reason
he
should
not
be
put
to
death;
that
that
is
a
mitigating
circumstance
that
should
be
given
independent
consideration;
and
the
prosecutor
argued,
"you
can
only
consider
it
in
answering
question
no.
2
as
to
the
probability
of
future
harm,
and
if
you
are
convinced
that
he
is...
that
there
is
a
risk
of
future
violence
or
future
criminal
threat
to
society,
you
must
nevertheless
answer
the
question
in
that
way,
and
the
judge
so-instructed.
"
that
would
be
proper,
i
gather,
under
the
texas
system?
justice
stevens
or
the
first
or
the
second.
justice
stevens
or
say
he
was
18,
and
he
said
a
man
of
18
shouldn't
be...
he
wanted
to
argue
that?
justice
stevens
but
how
could
it
if
the
judge
gave
the
instruction
that
justice
kennedy
proposed:
the
fact
that
he's
18
is
only
relevant
to
the
question
whether
he
would
constitute
a
continuing
threat
to
society...
you
may
not
weigh
it
for
any
other
purpose?
justice
stevens
correct.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
couldn't
you
make
the
same
argument
in
lockett,
that
all
the
evidence
was
received
and
could
have
been
considered,
but
just
for
limited
purposes,
rather
than
with
respect
to
the
ultimate
question?
justice
stevens
no.
but
the
instruction
would
preclude,
and
justice
scalia
suggested,
from
thinking
that
the
evidence
seven
years
of
good
behavior
in
prison
may
not
really
convince
me
that
he
will
not
engage
in
violence
in
the
future;
but
yet
if
i
also
find
that
he
went
to
church
every
day;
or
he
prayed
regularly
and
he
really
was
contrite
about
what
he
did,
i
don't
think
the
man
should
die.
they
couldn't
make
that
determination.
justice
stevens
well,
they
could
believe,
you
know,
he
was
sincerely
repentant
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
yet
not
have
a
strong
enough
character
to
avoid
involvement
in
future
criminal
activity.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
at
least
logically
possible
for
a
jury
to
think
that
it
must
answer
both
questions
in
the
affirmative;
but
nevertheless
feel
that
this
evidence
is
persuasive
on
the
question
whether
he
should
be
put
to
death?
