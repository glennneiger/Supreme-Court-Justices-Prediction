justice
scalia
as
i
recall,
we
require
only
relevant
mitigating
circumstances
to
be
considered.
is
that
a
relevant
mitigating
circumstance?
have
we
ever
said
that
it
is?
justice
scalia
that's
not
a
circumstance
of
the
offense.
that's
a
circumstance
of
the
trial,
it
seems
to
me.
the
offense
is
what
it
is.
whether
there
is
doubt
on
the
part
of
the
jury
whether
he
did
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
go
to
the
offense.
justice
scalia
well,
or
it
can
affect
the
jury
whether
you
tell
it
to
affect
them
or
not.
i
mean,
it
could
be
just
an
expression
of
the
realities,
as
opposed
to
the
legal
niceties.
justice
scalia
i
am
just
referring
to
what
our
comment
could
have
been
referring
to
when
we
said
it
may
be
of
use
to
the
defendant.
that's
the
only
point
i
was
making.
justice
scalia
mr.
stevens,
what
besides
the
residual
doubt,
which
you
say
couldn't
have
come
to
special
issue
no.
2,
what
else
couldn't
have
come
into
the
special
issue
questions?
justice
scalia
surely
the
state
is
entitled
to
specify
the
purposes
for
which
you
have
to
consider
it.
unless
you
know
the
purposes
for
which
you
can
consider
it,
you
really
have
no
basis
for
knowing
what
is
relevant,
mitigating
evidence;
and
what
isn't
relevant,
mitigating
evidence,
can
you?
justice
scalia
well,
i'm
perhaps
with
you
on
that,
but
you
allow
that
everything
except
the
residual
doubt
element
could
have
come
in
on
one
of
the
special
issues.
justice
scalia
for
limited
consideration.
justice
scalia
still,
except
for
the
residual
doubt
element,
you
must
acknowledge
what
has
happened
here
is
at
least
within
the
language
of
our
earlier
cases;
that
the
jury
could,
except
for
residual
doubt,
could
have
taken
into
account
all
of
the
mitigating
elements
you
are
concerned
about
with
one
exception?
justice
scalia
okay,
but
that's
still
technically
whether
it's
"must"
or
"may",
it
would
still
technically
come
within
that.
the
jury
must
consider
it
only
within
that
language.
the
jury
must
consider
it
only...
they
must
consider
it
for
this
limited
purpose
in
determining
whether
there
ia
a
probability
or
not.
justice
scalia
i
understand.
you
may
be
right
about
that,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
earlier
cases
that
lays
down
that
requirement,
at
least.
justice
scalia
i
thought
that
meant
just
independent
from
all
other
mitigating
factors,
where
you
interpret
it
to
mean
what
unrelated
to
any
specific
showing.
justice
scalia
well,
jurek
was
a
facial
attack
on
it,
though.
wasn't
our
pronouncement
much
more
facial
in
jurek?
didn't
we
say
this
texas
statute
is
okay?
justice
scalia
well,
there
is
this
difference.
hitchcock
said,
as
applied,
it
didn't
work
out
right
because
of
something
apart
from
what
the
statute
itself
says.
where
here,
you're
arguing
that
the
reason
this
didn't
work
as
applied
was
because
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
let
it
work
as
applied.
i
thought
we
had
resolved
that
in
jurek?
now,
maybe
you're
telling
us
jurek
is
wrong,
and
it
may
well
be.
i'm
darned
if
i
don't
think
we
decided
it
in
jurek,
anyway.
the
same
question
you're
presenting
to
us.
justice
scalia
but
the
assertion
here
is
that
you
may
come
up
with,
and
the
assertion
is
that
there
was
in
this
case
an
element
of
mitigation
that
was
mitigating
not
because
it
went
to
one
of
these
two
factors
but
for
some
other
reason,
such
as
in
particular
the
fact
that
he
had
been
well-behaved
the
last
time
he
was
in
prison,
which
could
go
to
whether
he
would
be
dangerous
in
the
future,
issue
no.
2,
or
it
could
also
go
to
the
question
whether
he
was
basically
a
pretty
good
person;
a
person
of
good
character.
that's
the
assertion
in
any
event.
now,
why
can't
a
jury
just
consider
that
as
mitigating
because
it
showed
he
wasn't
such
a
bad
person?
justice
scalia
i
know
it
is.
i'm
asking
why
it
should
be.
you're
not
addressing
the
argument
that
he's
made,
which
is
that
the
two
special
factors
unduly
limit
the
jury's
ability
to
take
account
of
the
special
factors.
it
says
you
can
xx
take
account
of
them
for
this
purpose,
not
for
any
other
purpose.
maybe,
i
think
a
person
of
good,
basically
good
character,
even
if
he
is
going
to
be
just
as
dangerous,
is
someone
not
basically
of
good
character,
shouldn't
be
executed.
and
i
can't
do
that
under
these
two
charges.
justice
scalia
was
that
juror
excused
for
cause
or
not
for
cause,
the
one
that
couldn't
see
the
difference
between
intentional
and
deliberate?
did
he
have
to
use
a
preemptory
challenge
to
get
rid
of
it?
justice
scalia
i
would
think,
if
the
difference
is
as
obvious
as
you
say,
and
you
have
a
juror
who
can't
understand
it,
you
shouldn't
have
to
waste
a
preemptory
challenge.
justice
scalia
your
point
is
it
sort
of
rewrites
to...
i
mean,
it
says
you
can
answer
no.
2
"no"
even
though
the
answer
is
"yes"?
justice
scalia
you're
talking
about
no.
5
in
particular,
your
instruction
that
you
may
answer
special
issue
no.
2
no.
2
"no"
even
though
its
real
answer
is
"yes".
that's
essentially
what
your
instruction
said?
