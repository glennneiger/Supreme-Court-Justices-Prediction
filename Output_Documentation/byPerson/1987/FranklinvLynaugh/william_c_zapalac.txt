mr.
william
c.
zapalac
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
franklin
contends
that
the
texas
capital
sentencing
statute
fails
to
allow
for
individualized
sentencing
because
it
does
not
provide
for
instructions
to
the
jury
on
how
to
consider
mitigating
evidence
in
their
deliberations
during
the
punishment
phase
of
the
trial.
he
relies
heavily
on
the
fact
that
during
his
particular
trial
the
jury
was
precluded
from
considering
any
residual
doubt
that
it
might
have
had
as
to
franklin's
guild
in
answering
the
special
issues.
first
of
all,
as
the
court
has
already
expressed,
there
has
never
been
any
constitutional
requirement
that
the
jury
take
into
account
residual
doubt
in
determining
the
punishment
that
is
to
be
meted
out
to
a
capital
defendant.
secondly,
this
is
not
one
of
the
factors
that
the
jury
is
to
be
taking
into
consideration
in
making
its
punishment
decision.
this
court
has
explicitly
said
that
the
relevant
mitigating
factors
that
are
to
be
taken
into
account
during
the
punishment
phase
concern
the
circumstance
of
the
offense
and
the
character
and
record
of
the
individual
defendant
before
the
court.
the
court
has
further
said
that
the
jury
is
to
be
concerned
with
the
personal
culpability
of
the
individual
defendant,
and
of
the
aspects
of
his
character
which
show
whether
he
can
be
rehabilitated
or
whether
he
is
going
to
continue
to
be
a
threat
to
society.
we
would
contend
that
residual
doubt
is
simply
any
residual
doubt
that
the
jury
might
entertain
is
simply
not
a
circumstance
of
the
offense;
is
not
relevant
mitigating
evidence;
that
the
jury
is
required
to
consider
in
its
punishment
deliberations.
but
even
if
it
were
required
to
take
into
account
this
type
of
evidence,
we
would
contend
that
both
of
the
first
two
texas
special
issues
which
are
submitted
in
every
capital
murder
case,
do
allow
for
the
consideration
of
the
residual
doubt
that
the
jury
might
entertain.
the
jury
is
first
of
all
asked
to
determine
whether
the
conduct
of
the
defendant,
in
committing
the
offense,
was
committed
deliberately
and
with
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
death
of
the
deceased
or
another
would
result.
second,
the
jury
is
required
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
probability
that
the
defendant
will
commit
future
acts
of
violence
that
will
constitute
a
continuing
threat
to
society.
this
court
recognized
in
adams
v.
texas
that
jurors
faced
with
the
possibility
of
imposing
the
death
penalty
are
going
to
be...
may
well
be
affected
by
that
very
awesome
burden;
and
that
they
may
approach
their
deliberations
with
a
great
deal
of
care
and
thought.
and
what
this
means
is
they
may
give
greater
weight
to
the
evidence
that's
put
before
them;
and
that
they
may
raise
their
standards
as
to
what
constitutes
reasonable
doubt,
so
that
any
doubt
that
they
might
have
as
to
the
defendant's
culpability
can
be
taken
into
account
in
the
punishment
deliberations.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
the
question
simply
asks,
if
he
is
allowed
to
live--
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
--the
court,
to
my
knowledge,
has
never
restricted
society
to
free
society
as
opposed
to,
for
example,
being
confined
in
prison.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
the
state's
position
is,
then,
that
any
juror
who
has
any
residual
doubts
about
the
actual
guilt
of
the
defendant
is
not
sufficient
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
his
guilt,
still
can
find
expression
for
those
concerns
in
the
texas
special
issues
to
determine
that,
by
giving
additional
weight
to
the
evidence
of
deliberateness,
as
was
brought
out
in
franklin's
case,
the
jury
would
be
able
to
return
a
"no"
answer
on
that
special
issue.
franklin's
case
is
a
good
example
of
this:
if
any
juror
had
any
doubt
about
the
actual
guilt
of
the
defendant,
the
evidence
that
was
presented,
and
the
argument
that
was
made
with
respect
to
the
first
special
issue,
the
deliberateness
issue,
could
have
given
the
juror...
that
juror,
a
means
of
expressing
his
residual
doubt;
and
the
ability
to
answer
the
question,
"no".
franklin
argued
that
the
facts
of
this
offense
demonstrated
that
he
had
not
given
careful
thought,
had
not
engaged
in
the
kind
of
reflection
when
he
committed
the
crime,
but
it
was,
in
his
words,
a
"crime
of
passion",
simply
an
instinctive
reaction
to
the
fact
that
his
victim
was
beginning
to
show
opposition
to
his
attempt
to
kidnap
and
rob.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
if
those
were
the--
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
--those
were
the
only
issues
presented,
and
those
were
the
concerns
that
the
jury
is
to
be
taking
into
account
in
its
sentencing
decision.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
the
instructions
that
the
courts
typically
give
are
that
you
are
to
consider
all
of
the
evidence
in
answering
the
special
issues.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
that
the--
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
--that
would
be
permissible,
because
our
position
is
that
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence;
all
the
evidence
that
goes
to
determine
the
individual
culpability
of
this
particular
defendant,
and
the
evidence
that
goes
to
determine
whether
he
can
be
rehabilitated,
whether
he's
going
to
continue
to
be
a
threat
to
society,
or
whether
there
is
a
possibility
of
treating
him
or
at
least
restraining
him
in
such
a
way
that
he
does
not
continue
to
be
a
threat,
is
covered
in
these
two
special
issues,
so
that
any
relevant
mitigating
evidence
that
would
be
presented
by
the
defendant,
can
be
considered
within
the
two
special
issues,
and
the
jury
could
properly
be
limited
to
consideration
of
the
evidence
within
those
special
issues.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
proper
to
say
that
the
evidence
can
be
limited
only
to
the
second
special
issue.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
be
limited
to
the
first
or
the
second
special
issue.
in
that
case,
if
the
only
evidence
that
the
defendant
produces
is
that
he
is
16
or
17...
under
texas
law
he'd
have
to
be
at
least
17
years
old
at
the
time
of
the
offense--
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
--if
the
only
thing
that
the
defendant
does
is
introduce
the
fact
that
his
age
at
the
time
of
his
offense,
certainly
that
can
be
considered
in
mitigation
in
the
jury.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
or
that
he
did
not
have
the
maturity
to
act
with
the
kind
of
deliberateness--
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
--that
we
would
ascribe
to
people
that
we
think
deserve
the
death
penalty.
again,
if
the
defendant
simply
introduces
the
fact
of
his
age,
i
think
that
jurors
are
aware
that
young
people,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
for
example,
in
eddings,
younger
people
do
not
have
the
same
maturity
in
adults
and
are
not
held
necessarily
to
the
same
standard.
and
the
jury
can
be
aware
of
this;
the
jury
can
look
at
that
evidence
and
determine
whether
this
particular
defendant
acted
deliberately;
acted
with
the
kind
of
culpability
that
would
justify
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty;
or
whether
this
defendant
has
the
capacity
has
the
capacity
to
be
rehabilitated.
but
the
defendant
also
bears
the
responsibility,
if
he
wants
the
jury
to
give
additional
weight
to
all
this
evidence,
then
it's
incumbent
upon
him
to
come
in
and
explain
to
the
jury,
as
franklin
did
not
in
this
case
about
the
evidence
about
his
adjustment
to
prison
life;
explain
to
the
jury
why
this
evidence
is
relevant
to
the
considerations
that
the
jury
would
engage
in;
why
this
evidence
is
particularly
relevant
to
these
special
issues?
the
point
is
that
there
could
be
that
there
is
medical
evidence
or
psychiatric
testimony
that
could
be
developed
that
shows
that
this
particular
individual
did
not
have
the
maturity,
the
capability,
of
committing
the
act
with
the
kind
of
deliberateness
that's
necessary
for
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
because
this
is
an
aspect
of
his
character
that
is
a
relevant
consideration
that
the
jury
needs
to
take
into
account.
i
would
point
out
first
that
franklin
did
not
argue
this
part
of
his
character
as
a
mitigating
factor.
he
limited
his
argument
simply
to
the
fact
that
if
he
was
in
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
he's
not
going
to
be
a
danger
to
anyone;
he's
demonstrated
in
the
past
that
he's
not
going
to
be
a
danger.
but
beyond
that,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
defendant
to
show
how
this
is
relevant
to
one
of
the
special
issues.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
this
court
has
said
that
the
relevant
concerns
that
the
jury
must
take
into
account
and
must
be
looking
at
are
the
individual
culpability
of
the
defendant
what
comes
before
it;
and
the
aspects
of
that
defendant's
character
that
demonstrate,
for
example,
whether
he
is
going
to
be
capable
of
being
rehabilitated.
and
we
would
say
that
if
that
evidence
of
the
individual's
character
shows
that
he
can
be
rehabilitated,
or
at
least
show
that
he's
not
going
to
be
a
danger
as
long
as
he's
confined
in
prison,
that
that
is
certainly
relevant
mitigating
evidence,
and
that
the
texas
statute
allows
for
consideration
of
that
evidence.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
that's
correct,
because
as
this
court
pointed
out,
the
relevant
considerations,
the
concerns,
that
the
jury
is
to
be
looking
at
is
the
individual
culpability
of
this
defendant;
this
is
the
purpose
of
individualized
sentencing;
this
is
why
we
want
to
have
the
juries
engage
in
individualized
sentencing,
because
we
want
to
look
at
the
culpability
of
this
particular
defendant
to
determine
his,
for
example,
his
degree
of
participation
in
the
offense;
his
degree
of
the
culpability
that
he
bears
for
the
very
type
of
crime
that
he
committed;
whether
it
was
a
particularly
savage
and
brutal
crime;
whether
there
were
perhaps
mitigating
aspects
even
in
the
circumstances
of
the
offense,
in
the
way
that
the
crime
was
committed.
and
also
those
aspects
of
the
defendant's
character
which
demonstrate
that
he
is
a
person
who
doesn't
deserve
the
death
penalty;
that
he
is
a
person
who
can
be
rehabilitated
who
is
not
going
to
pose
a
threat
to
society
in
the
future.
and
it's
these
concerns
that
the
texas
special
issues
address;
it's
these
concerns
that
the
jury's
attention
is
focused
on
during
the
punishment
phase
of
the
trial.
in
his
brief,
franklin
argues
that
the
concepts
of
"intentional"
which
is
used
to
define
the
culpable
mental
state
for
capital
murder;
and
"deliberate"
is
used
in
the
first
special
issue,
are
virtually
identical;
and
therefore,
a
jury
who
has
convicted
a
defendant
of
capital
murder
is
almost
bound
to
return
an
affirmative
answer
to
the
first
special
issue.
in
fact,
this
is
not
the
case.
the
court
of
appeals
has
indicated
in
the
past
that
the
two
terms
are
not
linguistic
equivalents;
that
the
term,
"intentional"
and
the
term,
"deliberate"
are
not
synonymous;
do
not
mean
the
same
thing;
and
that
juries
are
able
to
comprehend
this;
and
in
fact,
juries
are
able
to
comprehend
this.
for
example,
in
the
heckert
v.
state,
the
defendant
went
in
with
an
accomplice
into
a
residence
with
the
purpose
of
burglarizing
the
place.
the
co-defendant
handed
heckart
a
weapon;
said,
"stand
here;
i'm
going
to
go
look
for
things
to
rob.
"
heckert
saw
a
movement
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye;
recognized
that
it
was
not
his
accomplice,
who
had
gone
off
in
a
different
direction;
turned,
fired
two
shots
and
killed
the
victim.
the
jury
had
no
trouble
determining...
deciding,
that
this
was
an
intentional
act
that
the
defendant
intended;
that
he
killed
the
victim
at
the
time
he
fired
the
shots;
but
returned
a
"no"
answer
on
the
first
special
issue,
saying
that
there
was
no
deliberation;
there
was
no
volition;
no
choosing
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
conduct.
jurors
can
perceive
the
difference
between
the
two.
the
issue
is
also
particularly
relevant
in
determining
the
actual
culpability
of
the...
defendant
in
the
case
of
the
law
of
parties
or
accomplices,
where
the
degree
of
participation
of
the
actual
defendant
may
be
less
than
having
actually
committed
the
murder.
although
guilty
of
capital
murder
as
a
party
or
as
an
accomplice,
the
degree
of
participation
was
not
sufficient
that
the
jury
would
find
that
his
behavior
was
deliberate
and
culpable
enough
to
warrant
the
death
penalty.
there
are
numerous
cases
reported
in
texas
where
the
law
of
parties
has
been
at
issue;
the
defendant
has
been
convicted
under
the
law
of
parties,
but
the
jury
has
come
back
with
a
"no"
answer
to
the
first
issue.
finally,
in
franklin's
own
case,
the
process
of
arguing
that
franklin's
actions
were
not
deliberate
began
with
the
process
of
jury
selection;
and
during
voir
dire,
franklin
questioned
the...
members
extensively
on
their
understanding
of
intentional
and
deliberate,
and
their
ability
to
distinguish
the
two
terms.
at
least
one
potential
juror
was
excluded
because
the
two
terms
were
indistinguishable
in
that
persons's
mind.
during
the
punishment
phase
of
the
trial,
during
his
argument,
counsel
argued
at
length
that
all
of
the
facts
of
the
offense
showed
that
this
was
not
a
careful,
thoughtful,
reflective
action
on
the
part
of
franklin;
that
it
was
a
result
simply
of
a
crime
of
passion;
an
instinctive
reaction
to
the
situation;
and
was
not
something
that
warranted
the
death
penalty.
it
was
not
a
deliberate
act.
he
went
through
again
and
read
numerous
definitions
of
the
term,
"deliberate"
and
reiterated
that
these
actions
did
not
fall
within
the
terms
of
deliberate
conduct.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
i
don't
recall,
your
honor.
i
think
he
may
have
been
excused
for
cause,
but
i
don't
remember.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
i
would
think
that
it
would
have
been
for
cause,
but
i
don't
recall
exactly.
so
his
argument
that
the
first
special
issue,
in
actuality,
is
a
nullity
and
adds
nothing
to
the
jury's
consideration
certainly
is
not
borne
out
by
either
the
law
or
the
facts
of
his
own
particular
case.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
future
danger
issue,
franklin
cannot
deny
and
has
not
denied
that
he
was
able,
under
the
texas
statute,
under
the
procedures
employed
in
this
trial,
to
present
all
of
the
relevant
mitigating
evidence
that
he
wanted
to.
he
has
not
denied
that
he
was
limited
in
any
way
in
arguing
the
relevance
of
that
evidence
to
the
special
issues
during
his
jury
argument.
he
cannot
reasonably
claim
that
the
jury
could
not
seek
the
relevance
of
his
evidence
to
the
second
special
issue.
the
aspect
of
his
character
that
he
wants
to
give
an
independent
weight
was
not
borne
out
if
the
jury
did
not
see
this
particular
evidence;
did
not
see
the
effects
of
this
evidence
on
his
case;
the
fault
is
with
franklin,
and
he
has
not
shown
that
a
jury
instruction
to,
especially
in
the
form
that
he
has
proposed,
would
have
made
any
difference
in
the
jury's
decision;
would
have
added
anything
to
the
jury's
consideration;
would
have
pinpointed
the
jury
to
those
aspects
of
his
character
that
he
claims
were
exemplified
by
his
behavior
in
prison.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
he
certainly
did
not
attempt
to
add
any
special
issues.
i
don't
think
that
his
instructions,
particularly
added
anything
to
the
jury's
understanding
of
how
the
jury
was
to
proceed
with
their
deliberations.
in
fact,
the
jury,
although
in
this
case
apparently
not
explicitly
instructed
to
consider
all
the
evidence
during
voir
dire,
during
the
jury
argument
at
the
punishment
phase
of
the
trial,
the
jury
was
told
repeatedly
that
there
would
be
a
punishment
phase
of
the
trial;
you
will
be
able
to
consider
the
evidence
from
both
phases
of
the
trial
at
that
time
in
answering
the
special
issues.
both
sides
argued
the
facts
of
the
offense
from
the
guilt/innocence
phase;
as
well
as
the
evidence
that
came
out
at
the
punishment
phase
of
the
trial.
the
jury
clearly
was
aware
that
they
were
to
consider
all
of
the
evidence
that
had
been
presented
at
both
phases
of
the
trial.
the
jury
was
also
instructed
that
they
were
to
find
they
were
not
to
answer
one
of
the
specials...
either
of
the
special
issues
in
the
affirmative,
unless
they
were
persuaded
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
answer
should
be
"yes".
and
they
were
also
instructed
that
the
only
way
that
they
could
return
a
12
members,
unanimously
agreed
that
the
answer
should
be
"yes".
so
it's
very
clear
that
franklin
had
the
protections
of
the
jury
system;
had
the
protections
of
the
reasonable
doubt
standard;
and
that
the
texas
special
issues
allow
for
the
consideration
of
all
the
mitigating
evidence
that
he
presented.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
the
statute
in
ohio
really
did
not
allow
the
jury
to
consider
the
evidence
that
was
not
directly
related
to
the
three
specially
defined
mitigating
circumstances.
in
this
case,
franklin
has
pointed
to
no
evidence
that
either
he
attempted
to
introduce
or
that
he
would
have
liked
to
have
introduced;
or
that
he
could
even
think
about
from
any
source.
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
i
think
that
that
evidence,
i
really
fail
to
see
that
that
particular
evidence
has
any
kind
of
relevance
to
the
jury's
consideration,
other
than
as
it
goes
to
the
question
whether
this
particular
defendant
is
going
to
be
a
future
danger.
again--
mr.
william
c.
zapalac
--i
think
that
that
type
of
evidence
would
also
be
in
the
way
that
you
phrased
it
could
also
be
relevant
to
the
first
special
issue
in
whether
this
particular
defendant
is
capable
of
actually
engaging
in
the
type
of
behavior
that
is
so
personally
culpable
that
the
jury
would
be
justified
in
imposing
the
death
penalty.
so
i
think
that
the
texas
statute
does
take
into
account
those
considerations.
again,
franklin
did
not
make
the
argument
at
the
time
of
his
trial,
that
the
jury
should
look
at
these
aspects
of
his
character;
presented
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
fact
that
he
had
been
able
to
conform
his
behavior
in
prison;
had
been
able
to
adapt
his
life,
made
any
difference
other
than
the
fact
that
he
indicated
that
he
wouldn't
be
a
future
danger
as
long
as
he
was
confined
to
prison.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
think
that
the
state's
position
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
should
be
affirmed.
