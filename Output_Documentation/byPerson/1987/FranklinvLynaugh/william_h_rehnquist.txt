mr.
stevens,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
wasn't
that
put
in
terms
of
an
assumption
for
the
sake
of
argument
in
lockhart?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stevens,
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
p.m.--
mr.
stevens,
you
may
resume
where
you
were,
if
you
remember.
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
perhaps,
to
get
you
started
this
afternoon.
the
state's
brief
here
on
page
17
says
the
jury
was
instructed
to
consider
all
the
evidence
introduced
at
both
phases
of
the
trial
and
answering
the
special
issues.
now
i
gather
even
if
that
is
so
it
doesn't
satisfy
your
requests
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
record
doesn't
indicate...
the
record,
not
just
the
appendix,
but
the
record,
apparently,
does
not
incorporate
the
charges
on
the
guilt
phase?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
lockett,
of
course,
didn't
deal
with
instructions;
it
just
dealt
with
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
as
i
read
the
opinion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
not
contending
that
any
evidence
that
you
offered
should
have
been
admitted,
and
wasn't
admitted
in
violation
of
lockett,
are
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
depends
in
the
way
of
what
you
mean
by
"consider".
certainly
if
evidence
is
brought
in
before
a
jury,
and
the
jury
is
told
to
consider
all
the
evidence,
many
people
would
say
texas
is
permitting,
in
fact,
instructing
the
jury,
to
consider
all
the
evidence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
then
you're
going
beyond...
they
you're
cutting
into
jurek.
because
it's
perfectly
clear
in
jurek
that
texas
wasn't
providing
any
procedural
mechanism.
i
had
understood
the
opinion
of
the
texas
court
in
that
case
to
say
"we're
going
to
let
in
a
lot
of
stuff
here,
okay,
that
maybe
you
would
think
wouldn't
ordinarily
be
let
in
under
this
statute.
"
but
no
one
suggested
we're
going
to
add
some
more
special
circumstances.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
would
make
it
an
amendment
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stevens.
we
will
hear
next
to
mr.
zapalac.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zapalac.
mr.
stevens,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stevens,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-5546,
franklin
versus
lynaugh,
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
