justice
kennedy
well,
is
your
premise,
then,
that
lockett
undercuts
jurek?
justice
kennedy
well,
here's
what
jurek
said
on
that
point:
"in
the
present
case,
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
it
will
interpret
the
second
question
so
as
to
allow
the
defendant
to
bring
to
the
jury's
attention
whatever
mitigating
circumstances
he
may
be
able
to
show.
"
now
that
dictum...
that
holding,
was
complied
with
in
this
case,
was
it
not?
justice
kennedy
well
counsel,
suppose
that
the
instruction
here
were,
"ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you
can
consider
the
mitigating
evidence
only
with
reference
to
question
nos.
"
"1
and
2.
"
justice
kennedy
valid?
justice
kennedy
can
the
court
give
that
instruction
in
every
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
i'm
asking
if
you
could
give
the
instruction
that
i
proposed?
justice
kennedy
and
may
consider
all
of
the
mitigating
circumstances;
all
of
the
evidence
that's
been
presented
to
you;
but
only
in
order
to
answer
question
nos.
1
and
2,
and
for
no
other
purpose.
justice
kennedy
is
it
fair
to
say,
counsellor,
that
with
reference
to
franklin's
requested
instructions,
he
did
not
seek
to
add
any
special
issues,
but
simply
to
instruct
the
jury
how
the
special
issues
were
to
be
answered;
and
that
was
done?
is
that
your
position?
justice
kennedy
but
am
i
right,
counsel,
that
the
only
thing
you
requested
was
that
the
jurors
consider
those
factors
with
respect
to
special
issue
nos.
1
and
2?
or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
kennedy
which
instruction
was
that?
justice
kennedy
but
each
one
of
those
refers
only
to
the
jury's
consideration
of
questions
of
special
issue
nos.
1
and
2.
