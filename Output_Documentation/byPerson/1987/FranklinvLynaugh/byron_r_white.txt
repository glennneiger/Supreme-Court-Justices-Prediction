justice
white
i
think
the
only
charge
on
punishment
was
in
the
appendix
on
page
13?
justice
white
instruction
on
the
punishment
phase
just
repeated
what
the
court
said
at
the
guilt
stage...
or
you
wouldn't
be
here,
i
take
it?
consider
all
the
evidence?
justice
white
now,
did
you
ask
for
a
broader
instruction
than
you
got?
justice
white
but
you
want
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
said,
wholly
aside
from
any
of
these
questions
you
have
to
answer,
if
you
feel
like...
if
you
think
the
mitigating
circumstances
indicate
the
death
penalty
is
not
appropriate,
you
may
answer
any
of
these
questions
that
you
want
to
know.
justice
white
yes
well,
and
the
others
had
the
same
effect.
justice
white
i
thought
you
really
said
if
the
mitigating
evidence
indicated
the
death
penalty
were
inappropriate,
you
may
answer
question
no.
1
"no".
justice
white
yes,
but
they
have...
it
has
the
same
effect
either
way.
justice
white
but
lockett
didn't
purport
to
disturb
jurek
did
it?
justice
white
in
this
case--
--i
think
that
you
also
suggested
the
jury
said
that
the
only
consideration
that
the
texas
statute,
even
in
its
limited
considerations,
those
three
questions,
is
constitutional.
and
that
texas
need
not
add
any
independent
considerations?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case
which
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
six
of
us
agreed
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
there
has
not
an
opinion
for
the
court,
however,
i
have
filed
an
opinion
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia,
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
justice
blackmun
has
joined
that
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan
and
marshall
have
joined.
