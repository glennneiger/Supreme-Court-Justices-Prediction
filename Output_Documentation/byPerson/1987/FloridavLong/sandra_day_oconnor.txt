justice
o'connor
mr.
collette,
as
a
preliminary
matter,
would
you
explain
to
me
the
mechanics
of
the
plan
that
led
to
males
receiving
lower
monthly
benefits
than
females?
normally,
the
application
of
a
sex-based
table
would
not
yield
that
result.
justice
o'connor
just
a
small
point.
does
the
plaintiff
class
include
any
male
retirees
who
have
chosen
male
joint
annuitants?
i
take
it
it
would.
justice
o'connor
and
under
the
eleventh
circuit's
holding,
do
any
retirees
get
lower
benefits
as
a
result
of
that
holding,
or
is
everything
a
topping
up
in
effect?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
melvin,
what
language
in
manhart
informed
employers
that
they
were
forbidden
to
apply
sex
based
tables
to
non-employee
joint
beneficiaries?
i've
reread
the
opinion
and
i
had
trouble
finding
anything
in
there
that
would
address
that.
justice
o'connor
are
we
dealing
with
that?
