justice
stevens
may
i
ask
at
that
point,
is
one
of
the
options
available,
at
least
pre-august
1,
1983,
a
lump
sum
settlement?
justice
stevens
if
there
had
been,
just
to
clarify
the
question
justice
o'connor
raised,
if
there
had
been
a
lump
sum,
it
would
have
meant
that
the
female
would
have
gotten
a
larger
lump
sum?
justice
stevens
because
it's
calculated
backwards
from
life
expectancy
at
a
fixed
rate
where
they
both
get
the
same
amount.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
pre-manhart
retirees.
the
award
as
to
them
only
went
back
to
the
date
of
manhart,
though,
didn't
it?
justice
stevens
you
mean
if
they
got
too
low
benefits,
received
benefits
before
manhart,
those
are
also
adjusted?
justice
stevens
yes.
and
benefits
received
before
manhart?
justice
stevens
full
prospective
award,
but
they
did
not
get
an
adjustment
of
the
award
that
was
paid
to
them
between
the
date
of
their
retirement
and
the
date
of
the
manhart
decision?
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
you
retired
in
1975,
manhart
was
decided
when
in
'78?
justice
stevens
and
say
they
received
$100
a
month
during
those
three
years
in
benefits.
was
that
benefit
increased
later
for
those
three
years?
justice
stevens
well,
how
can
it
be?
if
they
got
an
addition
on
account
of
those
checks,
that
wouldn't
be
prospective.
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
the
only
payments
that
were
increased
were
those
benefits
that
were
paid
after
august
1,
1983?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
no
one
who
received
a
benefit
check
prior
to
august
1,
1983
had
that
check
adjusted.
justice
stevens
okay.
right.
well,
i
don't
want
to
add
to
the
confusion
but
supposing
that
someone
retired
say
before
1978,
received
retirement
checks
before
the
effective
date
of
manhart.
now
does
this
decree
augment
any
of
the
payments
that
person
got
for
that
period
of
time
before
'78?
justice
stevens
the
only
thing
i'd
ask
about
that
is
did
you
argue
in
the
lower
courts
that
the
state
was
in
the
posture
of
a
third
party?
justice
stevens
for
what
purpose
did
you
emphasize
that
fact
when
you
made
this
stipulation
that
the
court
could
regard
the
case
as
though
it
involved
only
one
employer?
why
would
you
be
talking
about
1100
employers?
