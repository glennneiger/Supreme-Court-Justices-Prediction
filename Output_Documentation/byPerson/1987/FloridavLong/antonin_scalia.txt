but
the
male
employee
is
not
suffering
discrimination
because
of
his
sex?
justice

of
somebody's
sex.
justice

but
that's
different
from
manhart.
justice

we
didn't
do
that
in
norris,
then.
we
were
wrong
in
norris,
then,
if
the
case
by
case
approach
is
preferred.
we
certainly
didn't
treat
it...
did
we
treat
it
as
a
factual
issue?
i
thought
we
announced
a
rule
that
would
apply
for
you
know
generally
in
norris,
didn't
we?
justice
scalia
so
you're
saying
that
was
wrong?
justice
scalia
mr.
melvin,
could
i
interrupt
you
for
a
minute?
this
letter
that
you
read
us
from
the...
what
was
the
fellow's
title?
the
auditor?
do
we
know
that
he
was
pronouncing
on
you
know
what
title
vii
required
and
what
manhart
held
and
so
forth?
justice
scalia
is
he
a
lawyer?
justice
scalia
so
for
all
we
know,
this
may
be
one
piece
of
advice
that
the
managers
of
the
system
got,
but
they
may
well
have
taken
that
letter
and
consulted
with
their
lawyers.
justice
scalia
and
their
lawyers
may
well
have
told
them,
you
know,
manhart
doesn't
say
this.
pre-manhart
it
doesn't
require,
and
manhart
doesn't
say
it.
and
who
is
this
fellow
who
is
just
some
actuary
and
we
went
to
law
school.
justice
scalia
wasn't
convinced
as
to
what?
justice
scalia
who
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
this?
this
was
a
factual
question.
who
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
factual
question?
