mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
your
permission,
i
will
depart
from
the
intended
structure
to
comment
on
three
features
of
my
opponent's
argument
that
will
perhaps
contribute
to
an
understanding
of
the
problem
we
are
here
to
address.
first,
justice
o'connor
inquired
about
the
apparent
anomaly
that
it
is
the
male
here
who
has
brought
the
claim
and
who
is
receiving
the
lower
benefit.
that
can
be
simply
explained
perhaps
by
pointing
out
that
the
familiar
phenomenon
of
an
assumed
longer
life
expectancy
for
the
female
which
would
require
in
typical
circumstances
that
a
fixed
amount
of
benefit
be
extended
over
a
longer
assumed
life
time
is
precisely
the
same
type
of
impact
that
produces
the
illegal
result
here.
it's
a
bit
disguised
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
arose
in
this
case
as
a
consequence
of
the
choice
made
by
the
men
to
elect
a
spousal
protection
option
under
which
not
the
single
lifetime
of
the
retired
employee
is
considered
but
the
combined
lifetimes
of
the
two.
as
a
consequence
of
that,
for
instance...
and
you
can
just
work
this
out
with
a
piece
of
paper
should
you
care
to,
and
i'll
assume
figures
to
make
it
simple...
if
you
assume
a
65
year
old
male
retires
and
his
life
expectancy
is
70,
then
that
person
has
a
five-year
life
assumption.
but
if
he's
designating
the
protection
of
a
slightly
younger
female
age
60,
who
would
have
a
75-year
life
expectancy,
her
life
expectancy
is
some
additional
15
years.
the
system
simply
looks
at
the
longer
of
the
two.
of
course,
it
doesn't
add
them,
just
looks
at
the
longer
of
the
two.
that's
a
15
year
payout.
if
you
reverse
that
and
you
assume
that
you
have
a
65
year
old
retiring
female
who,
with
a
75
year
life
expectancy
expects
to
live
ten
more
years,
and
you
add
to
that
picture
the
identical
other
facts,
i.e.,
that
she
designates
the
protection
of
a
male
spouse
and
give
the
male
spouse
the
same
age,
60,
with
his
lower
life
expectancy
of
70,
he's
expected
to
live
ten
years.
both
the
male
and
the
female
are
expected
to
live
ten
years.
those
are
comparable,
identically
comparable
opposite
relationships
between
the
male
and
the
female
retiring
employee,
but
because
of
the
15
year
payout
that's
assumed
for
the
life
expectancy
that's
extended
by
reason
of
sex,
there
results
the
familiar
downgrading
of
the
pension
benefit.
it
is
disguised
in
that
it
takes
place
in
the
male
paycheck.
the
members
of
this
class
are
not
exclusively
males.
they
are
males
and
they
are
also
the
surviving
joint
annuitants
of
the
males
so
in
many
instances,
we
have
widows
who
are
participating
in
this
class.
if
i
may
mention
another
thing
that
has
come
up
in
the
argument
that
i
think
requires
some
clarification,
counsel
has
placed
some
considerable
emphasis
and
twice
cited
to
this
court,
a
statistic
by
which
he
advises
you
that
i
think
some
45
percent
of
the
pension
plans
in
this
country
are
defined
benefit
plans
that
as
of
1983
when
you
decided
the
norris
case
had
not
yet
converted
to
unisex.
he
doesn't
also
advise
this
court,
so
i
shall,
that
he's
using
a
statistic
which
by
his
own
admission
doesn't
discriminate
between
employer
operated
plans
and
employer
sponsored
plans.
so
he's
citing
it
to
you
to
infer
that
throughout
this
country,
even
after
manhart,
there
were
a
huge
number
of
defined
benefit
plans
employer
operated,
we
must
assume
if
it's
to
be
relevant
to
our
case,
which
did
not
make
the
switch
to
unisex
until
1983,
inferring
to
you
the
enormity
of
a
national
impact.
but
the
statistic
on
which
he
relies
specifically
says
that
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
distinguish
between
an
employer
operated
plan
and
an
employer
sponsored
plan
in
developing
that
statistic.
and
i
invite
you
to
look
at
the
33rd
page
of
the
state's
brief,
footnote
27,
where
they
explain
that
in
detail,
stating,
and
i
quote:
"we'd
quickly
reveal
that
it
covers
all
state,
local
government
and
private
defined
benefit
and
defined
contribution
pension
plans
with
no
distinction
as
to
whether
employer
operated
or
employer
sponsored.
"
so
the
inference
urged
by
counsel
is
not
supported
by
the
statistic
on
which
he
relies.
counsel
has
also
made
an
argument
in
his
oral
presentation
to
the
court
that's
not
in
the
briefs
and
has
never
been
made
before
in
any
of
the
earlier
judicial
proceedings
affecting
florida
v.
long.
he
says
to
us
today
for
the
first
time
that
the
state
of
florida
occupies
a
position
analogous
to
that
of
a
third
party
insurer
because
after
all
the
state
of
florida
is
an
umbrella
or
parent
governmental
unit
having
enormous
sub-tiers
of
other
governmental
units
within
the
state
of
florida.
clearly,
this
is
something
that's
occurred
to
counsel
just
recently
in
preparing
his
argument.
i
would
remind
him,
and
i
respectfully
point
out
to
this
court
that
a
stipulation
that
they
entered
into,
which
appears
in
the
appendix,
page
36,
completely
belies
any
argument
that
would
be
predicated
upon
it,
and
it's
unfortunate
that
he
has
made
that
argument
to
you
today.
stipulation
no.
4,
and
i'm
reading
from
the
39th
page
of
the
appendix,
expressly
says
the
following:
"the
state
of
florida
for
the
purposes
of
title
vii
is
the
employer
of
the
members
of
the
plaintiffs'
class,
and
is
authorized
and
charged
under
florida
statutes
with
the
duty
and
responsibility
of
lawfully
administering
the
frs.
"
"no
third
party
unrelated
to
the
state
of
florida
is
authorized
to
or
does
administer
the
frs.
"
so
counsel's
argument,
while
it
may
have
some
appeal
to
him,
has
been
placed
to
rest
deep
in--
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
your
honor,
having
tried
the
case,
i
can
assure
that
that
meaning
of
that
stipulation
is
as
i
have
just
presented
it
to
the
court.
not
only
did
we
not
join
any
subunits
of
government
but
we
did
not
get
into
the
integral
aspects
of
any
of
the
subunits
of
government.
we
would
have
joined
issue
with
them
had
they
wanted
to
quarrel
with
that,
but
that
idea
is
a
new
one
before
us
this
morning.
it's
not
urged
in
the
brief,
it's
not
presented
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
was
not
argued
to
the
trial
judge
below.
and
i
think
the
reason
it
never
was
is
that
the
stipulation
to
which
i've
just
referred
does
appear
to
have
precluded
it.
the
central
theme
of
the
argument
that
counsel
has
made
in
effect
is
that
in
1983,
this
court
laid
down
a
rule
of
amnesty
with
respect
to
pension
plans.
a
rule
of
amnesty
that
said
that
a
pardon
is
given
with
respect
to
title
vii
violations
through
the
use
of
a
sex
based
mortality
table
for
all
kinds
of
plans,
even
those
plans
that
had
five
years
before
that
been
the
subject
of
an
earlier
ruling
of
this
court
in
manhart.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
i
find
nothing
in
that
that
addresses
that
issue,
either.
nor
has
the
issue
been
phrased
that
way
by
the
petitioner
the
employer
before
this
court.
in
the
course
of
these
proceedings,
that
question
has
never
been
asked
of
either
of
us,
i
don't
believe.
and
we
have
not
joined
issue
on
it.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
in
effect,
you
are
dealing
with
the
consequence
of
the
choice
of
designating
a
joint
annuitant,
but
the
question
cannot
be
isolated
in
that
fashion
as
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
class
primarily
consists
of
males...
these
are
the
retired
employees
themselves
who
are
making
this
application
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
their
joint
annuitants,
it's
not
only
the
joint
annuitant
following
the
death
of
the
male
who
suffers
a
reduction
in
the
pension
payment.
the
reduction
in
the
pension
payment
begins
to
occur
from
the
occasion
of
retirement
and
affects
the
male
as
well
as
the
female.
and
so
as
you
have
phrased
it,
that
actually
does
not
describe
the
manner
in
which
the
issue
arises.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
he
is
suffering
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
the
sex
of
his
joint
annuitant.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
yes.
yes,
that
question
is
different
from
manhart.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
that
type
of
problem
is
not
unlike
two
of
the
other
questions
that
were
raised
in
norris,
decided
in
norris,
and
yet
were
not
thought
to
be
such
a
new
and
unforeseeable
resolution
of
a
rule
of
law
as
would
have
invoked
concerns
about
retroactivity
or
would
have
led
to
discussions
of
proration.
in
the
norris
decision,
the
court
looked
backward
at
manhart
and
found
that
there
were
two
other
questions
in
manhart
that
had
not
been
addressed
and
answered.
manhart
of
course
dealt
with
the
inequality
in
the
required
contributions
in
the
pension
system.
it
did
not
deal,
as
we
do
here,
and
as
norris
did
in
1983,
with
discrimination
at
the
payout
stage
in
the
monthly
benefit
check.
nor
did
it
deal
specifically
with
the
question
of
whether
an
otherwise
liable
employer
for
a
violation
of
the
act
could
justify
the
practice
by
offering
a
non-discriminatory
option
in
combination
with
the
discriminatory
option.
when
we
read
manhart,
we
don't
find
answers
to
those
questions
either,
necessarily.
but
when
those
questions
were
addressed
five
years
later
in
norris,
this
court
disposed
of
them
without
struggling
over
those
questions
as
it
did
struggle
and
split
on
the
question
of
whether
to
extend
the
liability
on
an
employer
operated
plan
to
the
employer
sponsored
plan,
which
were
the
facts
before
it
in
norris.
the
court
said
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
discrimination
in
the
pay-in
contribution
stage
versus
discrimination
in
the
payout
stage,
"we
have
no
hesitation
at
holding,
as
have
all
but
one
of
the
other
lower
courts.
"
and
it
went
on
to
say
that
that
type
of
new
question
could
be
answered
rather
forthrightly
in
the
negative.
it
was
illegal.
similarly,
the
court
said,
"it
is
likewise
irrelevant
that
the
arizona
plan
includes
two
options.
"
and
went
ahead
to
dispose
of
that
question.
if
this
is
a
question
which
the
court
would
address,
i
think
it
would
address
it
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
liability
still
attaches.
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
that
is
the
consideration
that
this
body
undertakes
that
when
it
reaches
the
conclusion,
which
i
would
submit
should
be
that
liability
still
attaches,
that
this
court
will
not
conclude
that
it
has
announced
a
new
and
unforeseeable
rule
of
law.
consequently,
this
court
would
not
conclude
that
to
impose
that
conclusion
upon
the
state
of
florida
at
this
time
would
lead
to
non-retroactivity
considerations.
now,
if
i
may,
what's
being
argued
here
essentially
is
a
per
se
rule
of
law.
the
state
employer
contends
that
there
is
a
per
se
rule
of
defense
beginning
in
1983
as
to
which
all
prior
possible
liabilities
for
a
title
vii
pension
violation
are
excused.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
that
approach
to
the
problem
is
not
workable.
that
essentially
is
the
outlook
taken
by
the
ninth
circuit.
and
where
there
are
conflicts
between
the
ninth
and
the
eleventh,
it
is
largely
in
this
area.
the
primary
distinction
between
what
occurred
as
our
case
came
up
through
the
court
system
and
out
of
the
eleventh
circuit
versus
what
took
place
in
the
ninth
circuit
is
simply
this.
the
ninth
read
norris,
and
we
say
misread
norris,
to
establish
a
per
se
rule
of
defense
for
all
pension
cases
regardless
of
the
type
of
fund
that
was
involved,
regardless
of
how
much
money
the
pension
fund
might
have,
regardless
of
whether
the
pension
fund
had
an
excess
cash
surplus,
regardless
of
whether
it
was
a
defined
benefit
plan
or
defined
contribution
plan.
in
other
words,
a
blanket
rule.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
imposition
of
a
blanket
rule
is
often
an
inappropriate
way
to
get
to
the
best
judicial
result.
what
occurred
in
this
case
was
quite
different.
in
this
case,
without
the
imposition
of
any
blanket
rule,
the
trial
judge
undertook
to
hear
this
case
on
its
facts,
and
to
let
the
state
undertake
to
prove,
if
they
could,
what
they
now
argue
they
have
the
right
to
assert
to
you
as
a
a
matter
of
law.
he
put
them
to
the
proof
of
it
as
a
matter
of
fact.
when
he
put
them
to
the
proof
of
it
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
failed.
i
submit
to
you
that
in
looking
in
broad
terms
at
which
is
the
better
result,
that
of
the
eleventh
or
that
of
the
ninth,
we
should
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
benefit
of
taking
the
approach
suggested
by
the
eleventh
circuit
is
simply
that
it
does
permit
a
case
by
case
individual
pension
plan
by
pension
plan
analysis
of
impact,
of
the
arguments
in
support
of
proration,
and
any
other
matter
which
may
on
behalf
of
an
employer
constitute
a
basis
for
an
alleged
defense.
and
it
lets
those
defense
occupy
the
posture
of
fact.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
yes,
you
did,
in
many
respects.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
no,
it's
not
wrong,
i
don't
think.
you
announced
a
general
rule
of
liability
that
what
had
been
illegal
since
1978
in
manhart
for
an
employer
operated
plan
was
to
now
be
extended
to
and
similarly
become
illegal
for
an
employer
sponsored
plan,
as
was
the
case
in
norris.
and
then
in
norris,
the
court
dealt
with
one
of
the
very
important
aspects
of
that
case
which
differ
from
ours.
the
norris
case
was
a
defined
contribution
plan.
there
are
some
clear
implications
of
that
type
of
plan.
and
if
we
view
norris
as
a
per
se
rule
of
law
applying
to
a
defined
contribution
plan,
it
does
no
violence
to
the
judgment
that
you
have
before
you
in
florida
v.
long.
and
it
would
seem
to
make
good
policy,
because
there
are
characteristics
of
a
defined
contribution
plan
which
make
it
highly
sensitive
to
being
impacted
by
subsequent
impositions
of
liability
through
changes
of
law.
the
primary
concern--
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
--no,
i
think
that
that's
being
misread
there,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
offered
some
evidence...
not
unlike
the
statistic
on
which
they
relied
a
few
minutes
ago
twice
in
their
argument.
in
fact,
that
was
some
of
the
evidence,
i
believe,
that
was
precluded
below,
and
they
continued
to
cite
it
because
the
court
would
have
the
authority
to
notice
it
judicially
whether
it
was
stamped
in
evidence
below
or
not.
and
they
are
simply
saying
that
there
ought
to
be
a
kind
of
national
concern
on
how
many
other
possible
plans
generically
similar
to
this
one
might
be
impacted
by
an
outcome
in
this
case.
i
think
that
that's
a
wrong
approach
in
that
it,
for
instance,
it
overlooks
the
inferences
that
this
court
in
1976
in
the
bowman
case
put
upon
the
fact
that
title
vii
guarantees
no
claimant
damages,
guarantees
no
claimant
any
particular
outcome.
it
grants
to
the
federal
trial
judge,
the
discretion
to
fashion
such
relief
as
the
circumstances
may
require,
and
within
his
discretion,
that
might
be
merely
declaratory,
merely
injunctive
in
certain
respects.
it
may
or
may
not
in
his
discretion
extend
to
the
application
of
back
pay
concepts.
and
this
flexibility
is
the
desirable
thing.
and
i
think
when
we
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case
that
were
tried
in
florida,
we
see
why
that
was
so
desirable.
and
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
some
of
those
facts
because
this
fact
unique
case,
when
we
look
at
some
of
those
features,
i
think
it
becomes
clear
to
us
as
to
why
the
federal
trial
judge
was
not
convinced.
remember
the
difference
between
the
eleventh
and
the
ninth
is
that
the
ninth
reads
norris
as
giving
a
rule
of
law
about
the
defense.
the
trial
judge
in
the
eleventh
circuit
and
the
eleventh
circuit
itself
took
the
approach
that
there
is
no
absolute
rule
but
that
there
are
these
defenses
of
which
you
can
avail
yourself
if
you
can
prove
the
adequate
facts.
these
people
were
unable
to
prove
those
adequate
facts.
the
first
thing
that
we
put
in
proof
below,
which
i
think
was
especially
convincing,
was
a
memorandum
written
by
the
state
retirement
actuary
two
years
before
you
decided
the
manhart
case.
and
in
that
memorandum,
it's
an
absolutely
prophetic
memorandum
written
by
the
state
retirement
actuary,
it's
a
statutory
position
in
florida.
his
job
is
what
it
sounds
like
it
is.
and
he
wrote
it
to
his
boss,
the
pension
administrator
of
the
state
of
florida
that
he
had
attended
a
seminar
about
unisex
tables.
and
he
came
back
from
that
seminar
convinced
that
an
employer
operated
pension
plan,
such
as
the
one
that
was
in
florida,
could
not
lawfully
use
sex
based
mortality
tables.
and
since
he
didn't
think
so,
he
recommended
that
before
the
year
1977
began
that
they
abolish
them.
and
in
that
memorandum,
he
said,
just
briefly,
that
there
was
a
general
thrust
taken
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
by
which
their...
and
i'm
quoting...
"now
is
a
very
strong
possibility
that
actuaries
will
no
longer
be
permitted
to
use
mortality
standards
which
provide
for
the
use
of
differentiation
in
the
rate
of
mortality
by
sex.
"
and
i
think
it's
interesting
because
when
manhart
came
up
about
24
months
later,
this
court
divided
on
the
liability
questions.
and
some
of
the
justices
in
the
minority
on
liability
expressed
some
concerns
about
the
validity
of
unisex
actuarial
tables,
the
availability
of
them
to
various
employers,
the
general
practicality
of
proceeding
to
require
the
use
of
unisex
tables.
in
the
facts
of
the
florida
case,
it's
clear
that
those
expressed
concerns
were
not
a
problem
for
the
florida
facts
and
this
state
retirement
actuary
explains.
the
use
of
mortality
rates
on
a
single
unisex
basis
has
been
found
quite
practical
for
non-insured
plans
which
have
been
shifting
over
to
the
use
of
approximate
benefit
factors
anyway
and
thus
getting
away
from
the
type
of
precise
actuarial
equivalent
for
early
retirement
and
optional
benefits.
he
went
on
to
explain
exactly
what
the
probable
illegality
of
the
plan
would
be.
that
the
eeoc
is
concerned
that
when
actuarial
tables
are
sex
segregated,
this
frequently
results
in
the
payment
of
different
periodic
pension
benefits
to
males
and
females
under
the
guise
of
actuarial
equivalence.
he
specifically
said,
this
will
violate
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
and
in
the
last
page
of
his
memorandum,
his
recommendation
to
his
boss
was,
"in
light
of
the
strong
possibility
of
the
federal
government
mandating
the
use
of
such
tables,
i
would
recommend
that
we
resolve
this
difference
once
and
for
all.
"
now,
that
was
two
years
before
you
wrote
a
word
in
manhart.
when
the
manhart
decision
came
down...
and
i
might
add
the
evidence
was
that
he
got
no
reply
to
that
memo...
when
the
manhart
decision
came
down,
he
wrote
another
memorandum.
this
one
is
dated
may
19,
1978,
and
it
was
very
short.
he
said,
i
am
attaching
some
option
factors
that
we
can
use
to
straighten
out
the
sex
based
tables
in
florida.
and
now,
i'm
quoting,
he
says,
"this
analysis
will
serve
as
a
guide
to
developing
a
unisex
table
for
option
reduction
factors.
"
"in
light
of
the
recent
supreme
court
decision,
it
is
not
a
question
of,
if,
but
when
we
adopt
such
factors.
"
the
state
of
florida
was
never
puzzled
about
what
manhart
meant.
the
state
of
florida
at
that
time
was
not
struggling
with
payout
versus
pay-in.
was
not
struggling
with
the
question
of
having
a
non-discriminatory
option
benefit
combined
in
a
package
with
discriminatory
benefits.
the
state
retirement
actuary
simply
said,
it
is
not
a
question
of,
if,
but
when
we
adopt
such
factors.
what
happened
in
florida
was
a
tragedy.
the
policy
makers
didn't
agree
with
the
pension
administrators.
now,
as
we
view
the
state
of
florida
in
its
context
here
as
an
employer,
the
state
government
is
in
a
role
analogous
to
any
other
employer.
its
legislature
makes
its
policy.
what
did
the
florida
legislature
do
on
the
statement
of
the
manhart
case
in
1978?
in
1979,
the
florida
legislature
passed
an
anti-manhart
act.
florida
statute
112.66,
subsection
9.
in
their
wisdom,
they
passed
an
act
that
said
first
of
all,
the
good
part,
no
florida
government
pension
plan
shall
discriminate
in
its
benefit
formula
based
on
color,
national
origin,
sex
or
marital
status.
and
then
here
comes
the
hooker.
nothing
here
shall
preclude
a
plan
from
actuarially
adjusting
benefits
or
offering
options
based
on
sex,
age,
early
retirement
or
disability.
so
their
reaction
to
manhart
in
1978
was
to
pass
a
piece
of
local
policy
in
1979
that
is
in
effect
an
anti-manhart
act.
so
the
state
actuary
warned
them
two
years
before
you
ruled
that
this
was
going
to
happen.
when
you
did
rule
in
manhart,
he
says,
looked
it
has
happened.
it's
no
longer
a
question
of,
if;
it's
a
question
of
when.
the
reaction
of
the
legislature
was
to
say,
oh,
no,
we'll
just
pass
a
law
about
it.
and
they
made
a
statement
of
policy
that
says,
we're
going
to
continue
to
make
sex
based
discriminatory
differences
in
pension
payments,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
florida
was
an
employer
operated
defined
benefit
plan,
just
like
manhart.
so
under
those
facts,
those
defendants
knew
that
the
plan
was
illegal.
there
is
also
a
clear
statement
of
proof
as
to
what
the
motivation
was
when
florida
refused
to
make
the
change.
and
since
there's
a
comment
about
this
in
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion,
they
suggested
that
this
finding
of
fact
was
a
conclusion
of
law.
because
the
court
in
a
conclusion
of
law
section
discusses
this
at
some
considerable
length,
i'd
like
to
clear
that
up.
in
disputed
finding
of
fact
number
ten,
appearing
in
the
appendix
at
page
60,
judge
stafford,
the
trial
court
judge
in
this
case,
said,
and
i
am
quoting,
as
a
finding
of
fact,
before
he
got
to
his
conclusions
and
he
built
on
this
in
his
conclusions,
but
as
a
fact
finding,
he
said,
"on
rebuttal,
mr.
mcmillian...
who
was
a
state
retirement
director
who
wouldn't
answer
those
memos...
identified
the
reason
for
not
developing
the
no
cost
unisex
approach
before
1983.
"
that's
referred
to
as
a
no
cost
unisex
approach
because
if
they
had
made
that
switch
in
1978
when
they
knew
they
should
have,
you
simply
adopt
a
unisex
table
which
is
an
averaged
result
of
the
higher
male
rate
and
the
lower
female
rate
or
the
reverse
of
that
if
you
apply
it
here.
anyway,
it's
an
aggregation
of
the
two
and
since
you're
dealing
with
nonvested
rights,
you
simply
reduce
one
class
and
increase
the
second
class,
and
you
strike
a
unisex
level
of
benefit
for
both
sexes.
and
they're
talking
about
that
as
a
no-cost
approach.
and
they
said,
"mr.
mcmillian
identified
the
reason
for
not
developing
a
no-cost
unisex
approach
before
1983.
"
"that
reason
was
because
the
no
cost
approach
would
result
in
a
reduction
of
benefits
to
over
one-half
of
the
membership,
i.e.,
women.
"
"those
in
charge
did
not
want
to
take
that
step
unless
they
had
to.
"
the
court
then
went
on
to
say,
in
its
conclusions,
"the
state
simply
did
not
want
to
make
the
politically
unpopular
decision
to
reduce
female
benefits.
"
"the
state
chose
to
maintain
the
discriminatory
status
quo.
"
the
key
to
it
in
my
view
is
that
the
superior
thing
about
the
eleventh
circuit
conclusion
has
to
do
with
the
procedures
used
in
arriving
at
that
conclusion.
it
did
not
follow
a
per
se
rule
of
defense.
it
did
not
grant
to
this
employer
an
absolute
irrevocable
assumption
that
its
plan
is
just
like
the
most
sensitive
of
plans,
or
that
its
plan
was
just
like
the
norris
plan.
the
trial
judge
quite
correctly,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed
him
for
doing
it,
permitted
a
trial
on
the
facts
about
those
matters.
whereas
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
overruled
the
trial
judge
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
would
point
out
parenthetically
that
in
my
reading
of
those
ninth
circuit
cases,
i
do
notice
that
they
were
all
summarily
adjudicated
below.
and
while
we
are
critiquing
such
things,
it
might
be
well
to
say
that
it
would
have
perhaps
been
better
for
the
ninth
circuit
at
the
trial
level
to
have
had
a
full
trial,
rather
than
to
have
undertaken
to
summarily
adjudicate
some
of
those
questions.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
he
is
the
state
retirement
actuary.
his
job
is
created
by
state
statute,
and
his
responsibilities
are
described
in
the
statute
that
creates
that
job
and
that's
been
in
effect
for
many
many
years.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
no.
he
is
an
enrolled
actuary,
a
professional
pension
administrator.
he
is
not
an
attorney.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
yes.
we
tried
that
case
and
we
won
that
case
on
those
facts.
we
convinced
the
trial
judge
that
this
advice
was
the
real
advice
that
they
were
getting
that
the
administrators
took
the
stand
and
they
said
that
they
had
the
oral
advice
of
the
general
counsel
of
the
department
of
administration
and
he
also
testified
that
it
was
his
oral
opinion
that
because
in
manhart,
you
had
not
ruled
that
it
was
illegal
to
discriminate
at
the
payout
stage,
that
he
had
a
doubt.
and
also
in
manhart,
you
hadn't
ruled
that
you
couldn't
combine
a
discriminatory
and
a
non-discriminatory
pension
plan
together
and
have
both
be
legal.
and
so
he
had
these
questions.
however,
the
trial
judge
wasn't
convinced,
and
i'm
emphasizing
that
finding
of
fact.
he
took
all
of
that
into
account,
because
what
you're
suggesting
did
exactly
occur.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
and
in
fact,
there
were
lawyers'
memos.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
i
think
it's
an
employer's
burden
because
there
is
a
presumption
in
favor
of
retroactivity,
a
presumption
in
favor
of
full
relief
that
extends
from
your
albemarle
decisions
and
so
forth.
i
would
not
argue
to
you
that
those
are
per
se
rules
that
require
retroactivity.
i
think
it
is
error
to
accept
an
argument
originating
from
the
ninth
circuit
interpretation
that
says
there
is
a
per
se
rule
of
defense
that
applies
to
every
employer
regardless
of
the
type
of
pension
plan
or
the
amount
of
money
that
he
has
in
the
plan.
it
was
proven
here
that
this
plan
has
an
excess
of
over
$200
million.
mr.
woodrow
m.
melvin,
jr.
thank
you,
sir.
