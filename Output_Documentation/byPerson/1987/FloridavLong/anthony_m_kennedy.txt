justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
case
is
florida
versus
long,
no.
86-1685.
we
granted
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
to
review
this
case.
in
1978,
we
ruled
that
pension
funds
for
public
employees
could
not
discriminate
as
to
contributions
on
the
basis
of
sex.
that
was
the
manhart
case.
in
1983,
we
held
that
equal
treatment
also
is
required
for
benefits
that
is
to
say
in
the
pay-out
stage.
that
was
the
norris
case.
these
cases
established
with
the
use
of
sex-based
actuarial
tables
to
calculate
pension
benefits
or
contributions
is
discriminatory.
the
case
before
us
involves
the
florida
retirement
system
for
public
employees.
there
was
a
discriminatory
feature
in
this
plan.
the
state
cured
it
immediately
after
norris
was
decided.
the
central
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
state
should
have
acted
sooner
based
on
the
manhart
decision.
there
are
also
multiple
subsidiary
questions
regarding
the
appropriate
form
of
relief
if
a
violation
is
established.
the
district
court
granted
various
reliefs
to
the
class
members
basically
on
the
premise
that
manhart
in
1978
established
florida's
duty
to
conform
its
pay-out
provisions
and
on
the
theory
that
all
future
payments
should
be
conformed.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed.
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment.
we
hold
that
norris
rather
than
manhart
establishes
the
appropriate
date
for
commencing
liability
for
employer
operated
pension
plans
that
offered
discriminatory
payment
options.
until
norris,
employers
were
not
put
on
notice
that
benefit
payments
as
well
as
contributions
had
to
be
equal
for
males
and
females.
retroactive
relief
should
not
have
been
awarded
in
this
case
in
both
manhart
and
norris.
we
reject
--
we
rejected
the
application
of
retroactive
relief.
the
imposition
of
retroactive
liability
against
the
states,
local
governments
and
other
employers,
we
stated,
would
not
only
be
inequitable
but
also
would
threaten
the
security
of
the
retirement
system.
we
reaffirm
that
conclusion
today.
finally,
we
note
that
trial
courts
must
carefully
scrutinize
the
effect
of
an
award.
the
district
courts
ordered
to
make
future
adjustments
in
respondent's
benefits
had
a
retroactive
character
in
effect.
the
award
undermined
the
financial
calculus
of
the
retirement
system
requiring
either
additional
state
funds
or
alteration
of
other
retiree's
contractual
rights
to
meet
the
unexpected
liability.
we
therefore
reverse
this
portion
of
the
award
as
well.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
brennan
and
marshall
joined.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
