mr.
charles
t.
collette
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
this
case
is
is
simply
the
norris
non-retroactive
liability
holding
revisited
five
years
later.
and
this
case
deals
solely
with
the
relief
aspect
of
norris.
it
does
not
deal
with
the
norris
liability
holding.
in
this
regard,
our
contention
is
that
what
this
court
said
about
remedies
in
norris,
i.e.,
that
pension
plans
would
not
be
liable
under
title
vii
for
the
payment
of
benefits
attributable
to
pre-august
1,
1983
contributions,
even
though
such
benefits
were
calculated
using
sex
distinct
mortality
tables.
that
what
this
court
said
in
norris
bars
the
award
of
relief
herein
because
respondents
before
this
court
are
all
pre-august
1,
1983
retirees
whose
benefits
are
therefore
completely
attributable
to
pre-august
1,
1983
contributions.
in
short,
we
are
not
proposing
that
a
new
rule
of
law
be
laid
down
in
this
case.
rather,
we
are
simply
asking
that
the
norris
relief
rule
be
most
emphatically
underscored
herein.
that
prior
to
august
1,
1983,
there
will
be
no
liability.
but
that
subsequent
to
august
1,
1983,
there
will
be
and
is
liability
if
sex
distinct
mortality
tables
continue
in
the
use
of
benefit
calculation.
by
way
of
a
brief
road
map
to
my
argument,
i
intend
principally,
and
possibly
exclusively,
to
address
this
norris
non-retroactive,
this
norris
relief
issue.
i
do
not
intend
to
cover
the
first
and
second
alternative
arguments
in
our
brief
for
petitioners
unless
of
course
the
court
has
any
questions.
those
arguments
deal
with,
respectively,
whether
in
any
event
manhart
and
norris
bar
the
award
of
relief
to
the
pre-manhart
retirees
in
this
case,
and
whether
proration,
at
least
under
an
accrued
benefit
methodology
should
have
been
applied
to
the
award
of
relief
to
the
post-manhart
retirees
herein.
if
there
remains
time,
i
may
briefly
address
our
third
alternative
argument
on
the
title
vii
exhaustion
and
class
scope
limitation
issues.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
your
honor,
it
is
the
result
of
the
mechanics
of
a
defined
benefit
pension
plan.
the
primary
benefit
under
a
defined
benefit
plan,
such
as
the
frs,
is
calculated
pursuant
to
a
formula.
that
produces
an
equal
monthly
retirement
benefit
for
similarly
situated
males
and
females.
when
you
go
to
joint
annuitant
options,
then
mortality
tables
are
used.
and
to
reduce
the
future
expected
single
life
benefit
to
a
present
dollar
value,
when
sex
distinct
tables
were
used
prior
to
august
1,
1983,
the
woman
of
course
had
a
greater
primary
single
life
value
because
she
was
expected
to
live
longer.
therefore,
when
you
went
to
a
joint
annuitant
option,
it
resulted
in
her
receiving
a
greater
monthly
benefit
in
her
joint
annuitant
than
a
similarly
situated
male
and
his
joint
annuitant.
there's
a
good
brief
explanation
in
the
1983
law
review
article
by
hager
and
zempleman,
and
also
in
the
department
of
labor's
1983
cost
study.
the
basic
facts
with
respect
to
this
central
issue
are
these.
the
frs,
as
i
mentioned,
is
a
defined
benefit
pension
plan
with
over
1100
plus
florida
local
governmental
employers
participating
there.
it
is
a
relatively
new
or
youthful
pension
plan
created
in
1970
out
of
the
amalgamation
of
several
earlier
florida
retirement
plans.
from
its
inception
in
1970
to
present,
it
has
always
collected
equal
contributions
from
or
on
behalf
of
similarly
situated
males
and
females.
from
its
inception
in
1970
to
present
and
as
mentioned,
it
has
always
paid
the
same
primary
monthly
retirement
benefit
to
similarly
situated
males
and
females.
from
its
inception
in
1970
to
present,
in
addition
to
its
primary
life
benefit
and
as
mentioned,
it
has
had
three
joint
annuitant
benefits.
prior
to
august
1,
1983,
the
frs
calculated
benefits
thereunder
which
resulted
in
males
and
their
joint
annuitants,
in
response
to
your
question,
receiving
a
lesser
monthly
joint
annuitant
benefit
than
similarly
situated
males
and
females.
however,
effective
august
1,
1983,
and
because
of
this
court's
norris
decision,
the
frs
converted
to
unisex
mortality
tables
for
the
calculation
of
its
three
joint
annuitant
benefits.
and
this
has
resulted
in
similarly
situated
males
and
females
retiring
since
that
time
receiving
the
same
monthly
retirement
benefit.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
all
retirees
under
the
frs
obtain
a
vested
contractual
right
to
the
full
amount
of
their
retirement
benefits
which
vested
contractual
right
arises
as
of
the
effective
date
of
retirement
and
which
vested
contractual
right
prevents
the
state
from
thereafter
ever
subsequently
reducing
that
retiree's
benefits.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
no,
your
honor.
the
options
have
not
changed
since
creation.
the
primary
life
benefit
and
three
joint
annuitant
options.
there
was
no
lump
sum.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
that
is
absolutely
right.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
remember
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
award
in
this
case
were
it
to
be
implemented,
will
be
paid
by
the
frs
for
its
1100
plus
frs
participating
florida
governmental
employers
through
increased
contribution
rates.
in
short,
as
of
january
1983,
the
frs
was
in
exactly
the
same
situation
as
45
percent
of
defined
benefit
and
74
percent
of
defined
contribution
plans
in
this
country.
which
plans,
as
the
department
of
labor
pointed
out
in
its
1983
cost
study,
had
not
yet
as
of
such
date
converted
to
unisex
mortality
tables
for
benefit
calculation.
moreover,
and
when
norris
came
down,
florida
promptly
complied
therewith
as
mentioned
by
converting
to
unisex
tables
for
its
benefit
calculation.
on
these
facts,
the
district
court,
disagreeing
with
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
probe
v.
state
teachers'
retirement
system,
awarded
relief
totalling
approximately
$43.6
million.
the
eleventh
circuit,
likewise
disagreeing
with
the
ninth
circuit's
probe
decision,
affirmed
this
award
of
relief.
in
essence,
what
this
case
boils
down
to
is
simply
whether
norris
bars
the
award
of
retroactive
relief
in
the
form
of
both
prospective
and
retrospective
adjustment
of
pension
benefits
to
pre-august
1,
1983
retirees
under
a
state
operated
defined
benefit
pension
plan.
the
eleventh
circuit
held,
and
plaintiffs
argue,
that
norris
is
a
narrow
decision
limited
on
its
facts
to
the
manhart
open
market
exception
and
third
party
insurers.
that
norris
has
no
applicability
to
the
frs.
in
this
regard,
they
argue
that
since
the
state
of
florida
administers
the
frs,
there
is
no
third
party
issue
in
this
case.
that,
however,
overlooks
that
with
respect
to
over
half
of
its
retirees,
the
state,
through
the
frs,
is
a
third-party
insurer.
specifically,
over
half
the
retirees
of
the
frs
are
employees
of
florida
local
governments.
and
in
this
situation,
the
state
and
its
frs
is
in
essence
the
same
as
a
third
party
insurer.
it
is
in
essence
in
the
same
situation
as
the
tiaa
pref
plan
at
issue
in
spirt,
and
it
is
essence
in
the
same
position
as
the
private
insurance
companies
at
issue
in
norris.
plaintiffs,
as
said,
argue
norris
has
no
applicability
and
that
manhart
clearly
put
pension
plans
such
as
the
frs
on
notice
that
it
could
not
use
sex
distinct
tables
to
calculate
monthly
benefits.
however,
and
as
hager
and
zempleman
pointed
out
in
their
1983
drake
law
review
article,
manhart
created
confusion
and
uncertainty
in
the
pension
industry
as
to
whether
sex
distinct
mortality
tables
could
continue
to
be
used
in
benefit
calculations.
and
this
confusion
and
uncertainty
was
only
finally
resolved
by
this
court's
norris
decision.
indeed
it
was
only
until
this
court's
norris
decision
that
the
issue
of
whether
it
was
proper
to
do
anything
other
than
to
top
all
the
way
up,
in
this
situation
top
the
male
benefits
up
to
the
female
benefits,
only
norris
settled
that
you
could
use
unisex
topping
up.
in
fact,
the
lower
court
in
norris
used
the
full
topping
up
to
the
opposite
sex's
rate.
the
manhart
open
market
exception
meant
something
entirely
different
to
pension
plan
administrators
in
the
time
before
norris
than
that
which
it
is
argued
it
now
here
means
today.
in
short,
and
without
the
benefit
of
the
lens
provided
by
norris
employed
by
the
eleventh
circuit
in
its
analysis,
and
by
plaintiffs
in
their
argument,
the
manhart
open
market
exception
in
the
period
before
norris
seemed
to
permit
the
calculation
of
benefits
using
sex
distinct
mortality
tables,
especially
optional
joint
annuitant
benefits
in
a
defined
benefit
plan
such
as
the
frs.
for
the
use
of
such
tables
resulted
in
the
largest
benefit
a
retiree's...
and
i
quote
manhart...
"accumulated
contributions
could
command".
and
i
emphasize,
command.
not
purchase,
could
command
on
the
open
market.
judge
poole,
writing
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
probe
certainly
found
such
was
the
case
when
he
held
that
the
california
state
teachers'
retirement
system...
and
again
i
quote,
"reasonably
could
have
assumed
that
it
was
lawful
to
provide
an
optional
annuity
system
that
reflected
plans
offered
by
insurance
companies
on
the
open
market.
"
moreover,
the
facts
belie
that
the
pension
industry
viewed
manhart
as
requiring
a
wholesale
conversion
to
unisex
tables
for
benefit
calculation.
for
one
thing,
the
publications
of
the
national
actuarial
firms
in
the
period
after
manhart
stated
to
the
effect
that
manhart
created
more
problems
than
it
resolved,
and
that
the
pension
industry
should
take
a
wait
and
see
position.
for
another
thing,
and
as
previously
mentioned,
as
of
january
1983,
45
percent
of
defined
benefit
and
74
percent
of
defined
contribution
plans
in
this
country
had
not
yet
converted
to
sex
neutral
tables
for
benefit
calculation.
in
any
event,
norris
was
not
a
narrow
decision
limited
on
its
facts
solely
to
the
issue
of
the
manhart
open
market
exception
and
third
party
insurers.
rather,
it
is
manifestly
clear
that
the
norris
non-retroactive
liability
holding
was
meant
to
apply
to
all
pension
plans
throughout
this
country
including
the
frs.
in
other
words,
it
is
manifestly
clear
that
in
norris
this
court
intended
to
wipe
the
slate
clean
as
of
august
1,
1983,
for
all
pension
plans
in
this
country.
that
prior
to
that
line,
there
would
be
no
liability
if
sex
distinct
mortality
tables
had
been
used
in
benefit
calculation,
but
that
subsequent
to
august
1,
1983,
there
would
be
liability
if
such
tables
continued
in
benefit
calculation.
the
primary
concern
for
the
norris
non-retroactive
majority's
denial
of
retroactive
relief
was
its
concern
with
the
impact
a
retroactive
holding
could
have
on
pension
plans
throughout
this
country,
both
private
and
public.
and
that
concern
was
not
misplaced,
given
the
percentages
of
plans
which
the
department
of
labor
found
in
its
cost
study
had
not,
as
of
january
'83,
yet
converted
to
sex
neutral
tables.
moreover,
i
think
the
fact
that
this
court
took
a
highly
unusual
action
in
norris
by
delaying
its
judgment
three
weeks
underscores
that
the
norris
decision
was
intended
to
apply
to
all
pension
plans
throughout
this
country.
since
there
was
no
reason
to
provide
a
grace
period
for
the
arizona
plan
at
issue
in
norris
because
by
the
time
that
plan
reached
this
court,
its
objected
to
provisions
had
been
eliminated.
the
key
is
that
that
grace
period
was
effectively
utilized
by
the
frs
in
this
case
to
convert
to
unisex
mortality
tables
for
the
calculation
of
its
future
retirement
benefits.
that
grace
period
was
also
effectively
utilized
by
the
new
york
state
teachers'
retirement
system
in
hannahs
v.
new
york
state
teachers'
retirement
system
and
no
doubt
that
grace
period
was
effectively
utilized
by
thousands
of
pension
plans
throughout
this
country.
in
short,
norris
announced
a
broad
rule
of
relief
founded
on
policy
and
clearly
intended
to
prevent
a
regime
of
discretion
which
rule
is
applicable
to
all
pension
plans
throughout
this
country,
both
defined
benefit
and
defined
contribution.
which
rule
allows
those
plans
and
says
those
plans
could
continue
to
pay
their
retirement
benefits
to
pre-august
1,
1983
retirees
even
though
those
benefits
had
been
calculated
using
sex
distinct
mortality
tables.
because
of
this,
and
because
respondents
before
this
court,
i.e.,
plaintiffs
and
the
plaintiff
class,
are
all
pre-august
1,
1983
retirees.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
yes,
your
honor,
by
the
reason
of
the
structure
of
the
district
court's
order,
both
prospective
and
retrospective
adjustment
of
pension
benefits
were
awarded.
the
class
actually
consists
of
all
persons
who
retired
from
the
date
of
title
vii
up
to
but
just
prior
to
august
1,
1983.
prospective
adjustment
of
benefits
was
awarded
to
the
entire
class.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
yes.
to
the
post-manhart
portion
of
the
plaintiff
class,
both
prospective
and
retrospective
were
awarded
back
to
the
date
of
manhart.
so
in
essence,
the
pre-manhart
retirees
were
awarded
prospective
adjustment
of
pension
benefits,
and
the
post-manhart
retirees
were
as
well
awarded
retrospective.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
yes,
your
honor,
particularly
my
concern
is
the
pre-manhart
retirees.
i
simply
can't
conceive
how
florida
could
know
in
1975
or
1976
or
1977
anticipate
manhart,
even
arguing
that
manhart
was
clear.
how
could
it
know?
it
couldn't.
in
fact,
if
we
had
done
everything
the
district
court
said
we'd
do;
manhart
comes
out,
we
convert
to
unisex
tables
right
then
for
benefit
calculation
regardless
of
all
the
unanswered
questions
in
the
area
at
the
time.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
specifically
in
norris
and
justice
marshall
writing
for
the
court
on
the
liability
issue,
pointed
out
that
the--
mr.
charles
t.
collette
--yes,
your
honor,
i'm
aware
of
that.
pointed
out.
and
then
justice
powell
concurring
that
when
you
award
benefits,
even
prospectively,
it's
based
on
past
contributions
and
it
is
in
essence
retroactive
relief
because
it's
going
to
require
a
funding
that's
already
been
fixed.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
no.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
explain.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
the
benefits
were
always
calculated
using
sex
distinct
mortality
tables
until
norris.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
yes.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
benefits,
anybody
who
retired
up
to
the
date
of
manhart
benefits
calculated
as
of
date
of
retirement
and
payment
so
if
somebody
retired
in
'72,
'73,
'74,
they
get
a
full
prospective
award
for
all
their--
mr.
charles
t.
collette
--if
i
understand,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
t.
collette
--yes.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
yes.
but
prospectively.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
no,
there
was
nothing
paid
back.
there
was
no
retrospective
relief.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
i
think
that's
what
you're
talking
about.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
there
was
no
$100
we're
going
to--
mr.
charles
t.
collette
--no.
actually,
the
prospective
award
was
effective
as
of
april
30,
1986.
it's
been
stayed
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
that
is
not
entirely
correct.
the
post-manhart
retirees
had
that
check
adjusted
back
to
the
october
1
manhart
effective
date
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
no,
your
honor.
that
person
as
of
april
30,
1986,
it
would
augment
his
payments
from
that
date.
but
the
funding
and
the
actuarial
evaluation
it
requires
a
funding,
that
prospective
award
requires
a
funding
of
liability
that
was
not
anticipated
by
the
retirement
system
at
the
time
the
individual
retired.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.

very
likely.
the
class
size
is
roughly
around
12,000
people.
and
most
of
them
are
joint
annuitant,
the
vast
majority
95
percent
are
spouses,
but
on
the
ten-year
fixed
which
is
a
guaranteed
joint
annuity
for
ten
years
for
the
primary
life,
you
can
have
a
beneficiary
that
is
a
male.
so
it
is
a
possibility.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
no.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
can't.
that's
why
there's
a
funding
impact
on
the
frs
because
of
vested
contractual
rights.
i
thank
you.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
one
point.
the
stipulation
petition
appendix,
page
a-106,
paragraph
4,
was
simply
made
for
the
purposes
of
title
vii
to
recognize
the
use
of
the
word,
employer,
as
it's
used
in
the
definitional
section
of
title
vii,
which
the
law
recognizes
is
quite
broad,
covers
agents,
etcetera.
it
resolved
the
issue
that
the
only
entity
needed
to
be
sued
in
this
case
was
title
vii;
that
is
all.
unless
the
court
has
any
additional
questions,
i'll
waive--
mr.
charles
t.
collette
--no.
it's
inherent
in
the
facts
that
there
are
over
1100
and
we
kept
reemphasizing
that
point
factually
that
there
are
over
1100
plus
local
governmental
employers.
mr.
charles
t.
collette
because
in
point
of
fact,
the
frs...
there
is
no
third
party
outside
the
state
of
florida
that
administers
the
frs.
but
it
is
in
essence
the
agent
of
its
local
governments.
that
was
the
reason
for
the
complication
for
the
fact.
the
other
reason
for
that
1100
plus
is
the
local
impact
for
which
there
was
a
concern
expressed
in
norris
that
if
the
relief
is
implemented,
then
these
local
governmental
employers
who
have
no
choice
will
face
increased
contribution
rates,
and
there
is
some
expert
testimony
in
this
that
as
generally
recognized
in
norris,
florida
local
governments
are
in
a
crunch,
fiscally.
thank
you
very
much.
