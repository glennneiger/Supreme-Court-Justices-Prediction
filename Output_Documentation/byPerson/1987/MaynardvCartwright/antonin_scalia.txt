justice
scalia
what
is
so
especially
atrocious,
heinous
or
cruel?
it
sounds
like
a
routine
murder
to
me.
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
the
latter.
i
can
see
how
there
was
a
lot
of
psychological
suffering
by
mrs.
riddle,
and
i
can
see
that
his
treatment
of
mrs.
riddle
was
quite
atrocious,
slitting
her
throat
and
so
forth.
but
he
just
dispatched
mr.
riddle
with
one
blast
of
his
shotgun.
justice
scalia
did
the
instructions
here
allow
the
jury
to
consider
the
atrociousness
or
heinousness
of
the
crime
as
a
whole?
that
is,
could
it
take
into
account
the
torture
of
mrs.
riddle
that
went
with
the
whole
thing?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
that
that's
constitutionally
permissible
under
our
decision;
that
we
can
look
at
the
whole
crime
and
not
just
the
murder
of
mr.
riddle
alone?
justice
scalia
well,
that
seems
to
me
a
much
stronger
part
of
your
case
than
whatever
happened
to
mr.
riddle
who
was
dead
quite
soon.
but
the
defendant
here
intentionally
shot
her
in
both
legs
rather
than
killing
her.
and
then
after
he
had
killed
mr.
riddle,
came
back
and
slit
her
throat.
somehow
or
other
she
didn't
die.
justice
scalia
ms.
dickerson,
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
justice
stevens's
question
about
specifically
whether
the
jury
was
asked
to
take
into
account
the
suffering
that
the
wife
endured.
was
that
part
of
the
prosecution's
argument,
that
this
was
heinous
and
atrocious
because
of
the
torture
of
the
wife;
was
that
part
of
the
state's
case?
justice
scalia
and
the
whole
thing
went
to
the
jury
together,
not
just
the
killing
of
the
husband,
but
the
whole
incident,
including
the
wounding
of
the
wife?
justice
scalia
did
you
try
to
bring
up
here,
did
the
attorney
general's
office
try
to
bring
up
here,
did
somebody
try
to
bring
up
here
the
case
in
which
the
oklahoma
court
made
the
reinterpretation?
justice
scalia
pardon?
justice
scalia
well,
why
not?
wasn't
that
the
place
to
fight
out
this
issue?
i
mean
in
that
case,
you
could
have
said,
you
know,
the
oklahoma
court
has
reinterpreted
its
state
law
solely
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
we
think
that's
wrong.
essentially
you
are
attacking
that
here
in
a
collateral
proceeding,
aren't
you?
justice
scalia
did
the
state
win
or
lose
in
stouffer?
justice
scalia
well,
then
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
state
to
bring
it
here,
i
presume.
what
would
the
state
have
been
asking
us
to
do?
affirm?
justice
scalia
no,
i'm
sorry.
the
only
torture
imposed
upon
the
dead
victim
that
could
have
been
attributable
to
the
surviving
victim
was
psychological
torture.
justice
scalia
right?
so
that
seems
to
contradict
what
you
said
earlier
that
psychological
torture
is
not
something
that
the
oklahoma
courts
would
take
into
account.
they
felt
it
necessary
to
address
it
in
this
case,
didn't
they?
justice
scalia
what
other
kind
of
torture...
what
kind
of
torture
could
they
have
been
referring
to
then
when
they
felt
it
necessary
to
say
the
surviving,
what
happened
to
the
surviving
victim
is
irrelevant?
it
would
have
been
unnecessary
to
address
it
if--
justice
scalia
ms.
welch,
do
you
think
that
our
standard
requires
that
whatever
torture
or
atrociousness
there
is
in
the
crime
have
been
directed
at
the
victim?
that
is
to
say,
suppose
you
have
a
crime
in
which
someone
comes
and
tortures
very
maliciously
eight
people,
kills
the
ninth.
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
ninth
knew
of
the
torture
of
the
other
eight,
and
the
whole
thing
goes
to
trial
together.
could
he
receive
the
death
penalty
because
the
circumstances
of
the
entire
crime
were
especially
heinous,
atrocious
and
cruel?
he
tortured
nine
people;
only
one
of
them
died.
justice
scalia
that
would
be
constitutional
as
you
understand
our
rules.
justice
scalia
ms.
welch,
the
state
relies
upon
the
fact
that
we
approved
language
precisely
like
this
in
the
proffitt
case
in
1976.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
scalia
ms.
welch,
could
i
return
for
a
moment
to
the
argument,
which
i
do
see
as
a
problem
here,
that
oklahoma
has
already
construed
its
statute
in
a
fashion
that
can't
well
apply
here?
what
i
am
concerned
about
is
if
that
construction
by
oklahoma
was
believed
to
be
under
compulsion
of
federal
law,
that
is,
you
wouldn't
have
wanted
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
say,
we're
going
to
ignore
federal
circuit
court's
opinion
as
to
what
federal
constitutional
law,
you
certainly
wouldn't
want
them
to
ignore
that.
indeed,
they
couldn't
ignore
it
because
whoever
is
sentenced
is
going
to
have
to
go
to
federal
habeas
eventually.
justice
scalia
but
how
does
the
state
get
review...
assuming
that
that
decision
was
erroneous,
if
it
were
erroneous,
how
would
the
state
have
gotten
review
of
it
if
indeed
in
the
case
where
that
new
interpretation
is
announced,
the
state
wins
even
under
the
new
interpretation?
justice
scalia
in
a
later
case.
justice
scalia
but
why
not
this
one?
justice
scalia
why
is
that
any
better
than
this
case?
justice
scalia
and
vice-versa,
i
suppose.
