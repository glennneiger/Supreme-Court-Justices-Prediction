justice
marshall
ms.
dickerson,
as
between
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
the
supreme
court,
does
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
have
to
follow
the
supreme
court?
justice
marshall
i
mean,
but
there
is
no
way
to
go
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
the
supreme
court,
is
there?
justice
marshall
well,
can
it
go
indirectly?
justice
marshall
i
am
trying
to
find...
if
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
says
yes,
and
the
supreme
court
says
no,
what
is
it,
yes
or
no?
justice
marshall
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
oklahoma
supreme
court?
justice
marshall
it
doesn't
have
any
jurisdiction,
does
it?
justice
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
but
once
a
statute
is
declared
vague
from
a
federal
standpoint,
the
only
option
the
state
has
is
to
construe
it
again
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
and
so
we
are
now
in
the
position
that
oklahoma
has
construed
this
statute
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
that,
i
would
assume,
is
binding
on
us.
