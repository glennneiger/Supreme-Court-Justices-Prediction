blackmun
what
do
those
opinions
do
to
your
case?
justice
blackmun
in
other
words,
you
are
taking
the
position
that
the
tenth
circuit,
and
it
was
unanimous
wasn't
it?
justice
blackmun
misinterpreted
our
decisions
here?
justice
blackmun
you
are
swimming
upstream,
aren't
you,
with
an
en
banc
case?
justice
blackmun
could
i
bring
you
back
to
your
comment
before
the
last
series
of
questions?
you
made
a
reference
to
the
panel
opinion,
and
i
didn't
quite
follow
you
there.
what
is
the
significance
of
the
panel
opinion
by
judge
tacha?
justice
blackmun
but
wasn't
that
vacated
by
the
en
banc
opinion?
justice
blackmun
therefore,
what
significance
is
it?
justice
blackmun
then
i
wonder
why
you
mention
it.
justice
blackmun
but
he
is
the
same
judge
who
wrote
the
en
banc
opinion.
