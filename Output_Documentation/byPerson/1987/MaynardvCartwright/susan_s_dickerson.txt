ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
applied
the
principle
of
godfrey
v.
georgia
too
restrictively
when
it
invalidated
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
determination
and
interpretation
that
the
murder
of
hugh
riddle
was
especially
heinous,
atrocious
or
cruel.
godfrey,
in
the
plurality
opinion,
stated
that
the
capital
sentencer's
discretion
must
be
channeled
by
clear
and
objective
standards.
the
state
submits
that
the
tenth
circuit,
by
its
ruling,
applied
that
principle
in
a
manner
that
effectively
requires
a
finding
of
serious
physical
abuse
prior
to
a
finding
of
this
particular
statutory
aggravating
circumstance.
it
is
our
position
that
physical
abuse
to
the
victim
is
not
a
necessary
element
of
a
constitutional
interpretation
of
this
circumstances,
and
that,
moreover,
the
jury's
discretion
was
channeled
appropriately
in
this
case.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
yes,
justice
o'connor.
as
a
direct
result
of
the
maynard
decision,
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals,
less
than
40
days
after
the
en
banc
pronouncement,
narrowed
the
interpretation.
the
state's
position
would
be
that
that
narrowing
was
an
accent
to
the
current
status
of
interpretation
of
federal
constitutional
law.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
no,
your
honor.
our
interpretation
would
be
that
they
were
solely
premised
upon
federal
constitutional
law.
all
of
the
citations
in
the
stouffer
case
refer
only
to
maynard
v.
cartwright
and
to
the
prior
opinions
of
this
court.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
justice
blackmun,
we
would
contend
that
jurisdiction
is
still
appropriate
with
this
court,
and
that
it
is
the
ultimate
decision
of
this
court
to
determine,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
whether
or
not
a
state
is
limited
to
a
finding
of
serious
physical
abuse.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
our
contention.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
in
godfrey,
there
was
a
dissent
which
indicated
that
psychological
torture
could
be
used
as
a
measure
of
determining
whether
or
not
that--
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
--yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
i
don't
believe
it's
necessary,
justice
o'connor,
to
overrule--
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
--the
distinctions
in
godfrey
are
that--
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
--in
godfrey,
godfrey
was
a
domestic
situation
in
which
the
killer
had
immediately
prior
to
the
killing
engaged
in
a
heated
conversation
with
this
estranged
wife,
proceeded
immediately
to
the
same,
shot
his
wife
and
killed
here,
and
then
proceeded
to
shoot
and
kill
the
mother-in-law.
in
godfrey,
only
a
portion
of
the
statutory
language
of
the
(b)(7)
subsection
circumstance
was
given.
and
in
our
case,
the
entire
language
of
the
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
circumstance
was
given.
additionally,
in
godfrey,
there
was
no
further
definitional
instruction
given
to
the
jury.
and
in
our
case,
in
instruction
no.
16,
which
is
found
at
page
12
of
the
joint
appendix,
definitions
were
given
which
provided
guidance
to
the
jury
in
this
instance.
at
the
outset
i
would
note
that
this
court
has
held
that
qualifying
language
used
in
an
instruction
can
render
acceptable
and
appropriate
an
instruction
which
might
otherwise
be
infirm.
in
the
case
of
california
v.
brown,
this
court
approved
of
the
giving
on
an
anti-sympathy
instruction
during
the
capital
sentencing
stage
of
a
trial
due
to
the
fact
that
the
instruction
cautioned
against
the
use
of
mere
sympathy
as
opposed
to
sympathy
alone.
instruction
no.
16
defines
the
terms
apart
from
"especially".
however,
the
state
would
note
initially
that
the
use
of
the
word
"especially"
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
serves
to
channel
and
qualify
those
types
of
murders
which
are
more
evil
than
any
murder
which
is
certainly
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel.
in
addition,
the
instructions
given
provided
that
heinous
means
extremely
wicked
or
shockingly
evil.
atrocious
means
outrageously
wicked
and
vile.
and
cruel
means
pitiless
or
designed
to
inflict
a
high
degree
of
pain,
utter
indifference
to
or
enjoyment
of
the
suffering
of
others.
these
instruction
and
definitions
were
given
in
the
disjunctive
term
and
provided
further
guidance
which
was
not
provided
to
the
jury
in
the
godfrey
case.
as
well
in
godfrey,
there
was
no
other
aggravating
circumstances
found,
and
in
this
instance,
a
second
aggravating
circumstance
of
great
risk
of
death
to
more
than
one
person
was
found.
addressing
specifically
the
definitions
that
were
given,
heinous
and
atrocious
turn
specifically
to
consideration
of
the
killer's
attitude
and
the
manner
of
the
killing.
and
because
the
discretion
was
channeled
by
use
of
definitions,
and
because
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
then
assessed
the
definitions
and
the
application
of
the
facts
to
those
definitions,
the
state
submits
that
sufficient
narrowing
occurred.
in
this
case,
the
heinousness
and
atrocity
of
the
crime
was
evidenced
by
defendant
cartwright's
intent
to
get
even
with
the
riddles.
he
had
spent
over
four
months
harboring
his
grudge,
and
he
had
told
two
witnesses
that
he
intended
to
get
even
with
the
riddles.
as
pointed
out
in
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals'
opinion,
the
defendant
either
lay
in
wait
our
returned
under
cover
of
darkness
to
commit
his
acts
against
the
riddles.
additionally,
he
disconnected
the
phone.
he
provided
a
note
on
the
front
door
of
the
home
to
conceal
his
deeds.
he
engaged
in
a
larceny
attempt,
and
rather
than
turn
himself
into
the
authorities
immediately
upon
completion
of
the
crime,
as
did
the
defendant
in
godfrey,
he
fled
the
scene
once
the
authorities
arrived
on
the
scene,
and
turned
himself
in
only
two
days
later
at
the
convincing
of
his
family
members.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
justice
scalia,
we
would
contend
that
this
intent,
this
laying
in
wait,
this
return
under
cover
of
darkness,
all
of
the
items
i've
mentioned
previously,
as
well
as
the
cruelty
inflicted
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
there
were
psychological
torture
experienced
by
mr.
riddle,
although
he
died
instantly,
which
would
set
this
murder
apart
from
other
murders.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
put
the
entire
crime
scenario
in
perspective
in
that
the
riddles
had
been
in
the
living
room.
mrs.
riddle
arose
to
go
into
the
hall,
was
confronted
by
defendant
cartwright;
was
shot
once;
fell
to
the
floor;
was
shot
again,
and
importantly,
that
second
shot
defendant
cartwright
did
not
shoot
her
in
the
chest
or
in
the
head
where
she
would
be
rendered
dead
instantly,
but
left
her
there
to
suffer
such
that
mr.
riddle
would
then
in
turn
hear
his
wife
suffering
in
the
hall,
and
then
immediately
was
confronted
by
defendant
cartwright.
the
defendant
fired
two
shots
at
mr.
cartwright,
hitting
him
once
in
the
chest
and
killing
him
instantly
at
that
point,
but
there
was
a
period
of
psychological
torture
involved.
and,
in
fact,
unlike
the
situation
in
godfrey
where
the
prosecutor
conceded
that
there
was
no
torture,
in
this
instance,
in
the
closing
remarks
of
the
prosecutor
at
page
633
of
the
transcript,
the
prosecutor
noted
that
mr.
riddle
must
have
endured
some
psychological
trauma
from
having
heard
his
wife
injured
in
the
next
room
immediately
prior
to
being
killed
himself.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
would--
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
--yes,
your
honor.
as
long
ago
as
gregg
v.
georgia,
this
court
indicated
that
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
were
appropriate
for
consideration
by
this
court
in
assessing
the
validity
of
a
death
penalty.
just
o'connor,
in
her
special
concurrence
to
the
california
v.
brown
opinion,
indicated
that
validity
of
the
death
sentence
must
reflect
a
reasoned
moral
response
to
the
defendant's
background,
character
and
crime.
arid
part
of
the
crime
in
this
instance
was
the
inflicting
of
pain
and
suffering
that
he
inflicted
on
mrs.
riddle.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
in
all
fairness,
the
first
shot
may
have
been
intended
to
have
been
aimed
at
another
part
of
her
body,
but
there
was
some
evidence
that
she
deflected
the
gun
shot
to
her
leg
in
the
first
instance.
but
clearly,
he
shot
her
with
the
second
shot
in
the
leg
as
opposed
to
shooting
her
in
the
chest
or
the
head
where
she
certainly
would
have
died
instantly.
it
is
appropriate
to
consider
the
character
of
the
defendant
in
this
case,
and
we
are
looking
in
this
particular
circumstance
to
see
the
evil
character
of
a
defendant.
and
certainly
the
acts
of
this
particular
defendant
are
more
evil.
in
connection
with
your
question,
justice
scalia,
i
would
note
that
in
the
prior
opinion
of
the
three
judge
panel
of
the
tenth
circuit
prior
to
the
reversal
en
banc,
judge
tacha,
who
wrote
the
en
banc
decision,
validated
the
existence
of
the
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
finding
upon
the
existence
of
suffering
to
mrs.
riddle.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
i
would
assume
that
his
ultimate
intention
were
to
kill
her
in
that
he
did
return
to
the
bedroom
where
she
had
managed
to
try
to
find
the
telephone
working,
he
did
slit
her
throat
and
stab
her
in
the
abdomen
rather
than
assist
her
upon
her
plea
for
help.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
justice
stevens,
i
think
it
would
be
a
fair
characterization
of
the
evidence
that
he
intended
not
only
that
mrs.
riddle
endure
some
torture,
but
that
mr.
riddle
endure
torture
as
it
related
to
the
suffering
of
mrs.
riddle
as
well
prior
to
the
time
that
he
did
finally
do
what
he
thought
would
in
fact
kill
her.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
not
to
the
extent
relied
upon
on
review
by
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals,
but
there
was
reference
made
to
the
torture,
the
psychological
trauma
to
which
mr.
riddle
had
been
exposed.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
which
mr.
riddle
had
suffered,
yes.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
also
a
lengthy
discussion
as
to
the
circumstances
of
mrs.
riddle's
torture,
because
conjointly
with
the
trying
for
murder,
there
was
a
count
of
shooting
with
intent
to
kill.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
in
that
instance,
i
believe
it
would
in
that
there
would
be
actual
suffering,
and
the
end
result,
the
end
circumstance
of
the
crime
would
be
that
there
would
be
some
suffering
endured
there
such
that
the
jury
could
rely
upon
a
finding
of
cruelty.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
our
approach
would
validate
a
finding
of
looking
at
the
killer's
attitude
as
well
as
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
i
would
think
it
could
focus
on
both.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
i
wouldn't
say
that
one
would
be
mutually
exclusive
of
the
other.
and
i
think
that
that's
what
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
done
is
allow
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
as
well
as
the
killer's
attitude
to
come
into
play
based
upon
previous
holdings
of
this
court
which
would
validate
looking
at
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
the
killer's
attitude.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
it
was
part
of
the
general
closing
argument
made
to
the
jury;
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
not
emphasized
to
the
great
degree
that
it
might
have
been,
but
it
was
part
of
the
closing
argument.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
both
were
tried
simultaneously.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
i
believe,
justice
blackmun,
i
was
trying
to
indicate
that
prior
to
the
panel
opinion,
prior
to
the
en
banc
opinion
the
three
judge
panel
opinion
involved
an
opinion
by
judge
tacha
that
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
torture
and
abuse
to
mrs.
riddle
could
appropriately
be
used
to
assess--
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
--yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
i
has
no
precedential
value.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
i
mention
it
merely
in
connection
of
the
fact
that
at
least
at
one
time
one
judge
was
of
the
opinion
that
that
information
could
be
used.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
the
holding
of
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
explicitly
state
that
would
be
the
only
constitutional
interpretation.
however,
the
state's
position
is
that
it
effectively
mandated
that
particular
interpretation
by
virtue
of
certain
language
in
the
en
banc
opinion.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
yes,
justice
brennan.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
yes,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
the--
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
--i
think
the
issue
remains
with
us
in
that
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
merely
responded
to
and
assented
to
the
current
status
of
federal
constitutional
law
as
interpreted
by
the
tenth
circuit.
the
en
banc
opinion
in
the
maynard
v.
cartwright
case
indicated
that
initially
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
eddings
had
referred
to,
and
it
had
expressly
adopted
the
profit
standard,
but
had
digressed
from
that
standard.
and
it
was
this
digression
from
that
standard
which
caused
the
tenth
circuit
consternation
and
concern.
and
our
position
would
be
that
the
digression
from
that
standard
was
not
an
unconstitutional
digression,
but
was
a
digression
which
would
allow
and
account
for
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
the
killer's
attitude
to
be
reflected
in
a
finding
of
this
particular
circumstance
that
the
murder
was
more
evil
than
your
ordinary
murder
situation.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
justice
brennan,
our
argument
would
be
that
it
could
be
due
to
the
fact
that
psychological
torture
took
place.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
when
interpreting
federal
constitutional
standards,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
not
directly
in
this
case,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
i
would
think
in
the
event
that--
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
--excuse
me.
i
thought
you
were
speaking
of
this
court.
in
oklahoma--
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
--in
oklahoma,
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
does
not
construe
criminal
law.
we
are
one
of
the
few
states--
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
justice
kennedy,
our
position
would
be
that
they
have
construed
it
only
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
in
that
they
were
directed,
as
it
were,
by
the
tenth
circuit
that
their
standard
which
they
had
previously
employed
did
not
comport
to
federal
constitutional
standards.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
again,
our
position
would
be
that
they
were
forced
to
adopt
this
standard
by
virtue
of
their
understanding
of
the
tenth
circuit--
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
--under
that
court's
understanding
of
federal
constitutional
law.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
very
may
well
go
back
to
the
previous
interpretation
which
it
had
held
to
be
valid
up
until
40
days
after
the
time
of
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
was
done
in
this
case.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
the
other
side
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
stouffer,
but
our
side
did
not.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
yes,
your
honor.
it
may
very
well
have
been
a
better
tactic
to
have
brought
it
up
in
that
particular
case.
however,
because
the
entire
stouffer
opinion
is
based
upon
interpretation
of
the
federal
standards,
i
can't
speak
to
why
it
was
not
done,
but
i
would
state
that
it
would
be

the
state
won,
because
although
they
invalidated
the
circumstance,
they
found
that
other
circumstances
existed.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
true,
there
would
not
have
been
an
issue
which
the
state
could
have
brought.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
prior
to--
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
--that's
correct,
justice
white.
prior
to
this
case,
contrary
to
the
position
of
the
attorney
general,
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
refused
to
conduct
a
reweighing
in
the
event
of
an
invalid
circumstance.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
prior
to
the
amendment
of
the
statute,
there
was
no
resentencing
hearing
which
was
directly
validated
by
statute--
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
--which
they
would
automatically
modify.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
but
they
have
changed
that.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
the
event
that
this
court
were
to
agree
with
the
tenth
circuit,
it
would
still
be
the
prerogative
of
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
reweigh
on
remand
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
crime
would
still
merit
the
death
penalty.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
it
can,
justice
brennan,
and
several
other
states
have
included
psychological
torture.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
they
have
never
directly
construed
that.
we
would
state
that
sufficient
channeling
has
occurred
in
this
instance
such
that
the
opinion
of
the
tenth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
and
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
susan
s.
dickerson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
dictate
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
godfrey
v.
georgia
which
would
mandate
a
requirement
of
physical
abuse
prior
to
the
existence
of
a
finding
that
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
of
an
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
existed.
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out
earlier,
an
argument,
and
i
would
concur
that
the
circumstance
can
be
proven
by
either
focus
upon
the
defendant's
intent,
or
upon
the
suffering
inflicted
by
the
victim
regardless
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
intent
to
torture.
in
this
case,
we
do
have
clear
objective
standards
which
provided
guidance
to
the
jury.
we
have
the
existence
of
the
use
of
the
word
"especially".
we
have
the
definitions
which
were
given.
and
although
those
definitions
were
not
explicitly
cited
in
proffitt,
they
were
in
state
v.
dixon
which
was
cited
to
in
the
proffitt
decision.
the
proffitt
language
was
approved
by
this
court.
however,
the
state
would
submit
that
proffitt
is
not
the
only
constitutional
interpretation
of
this
particular
aggravating
circumstance.
it
is
our
position
that
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals,
in
the
issue
on
rehearing
in
stouffer,
was
compelled
by
what
it
felt
to
be
the
dictates
of
federal
constitutional
law
to
alter
its
long-time
previous
opinion,
and
it
did
so
with
great
haste
in
order
to
avoid
refusing
to
follow
the
current
status
of
federal
law.
there
is
not
a
subjective
standardless
approach
used
in
this
case.
certainly
the
definitions,
the
application
of
the
facts
to
the
crime
in
this
case,
as
reflected
in
the
opinion
of
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals,
indicates
that
this
decision
was
certainly
more
objective
in
assessing
that
the
crime
was
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
more
so
than
with
regard
to
other
circumstances.
all
circumstances
are
not
capable
of
equal
objectivity.
some
states
have,
as
an
aggravating
circumstance,
that
which
is
clearly
objective.
for
example,
that
the
victim
was
pregnant
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
that
is
something
that
either
exists
or
does
not
exist.
along
the
lines
of
the
continuum
there,
this
court
has
approved
the
existence
of
the
notion
that
the
defendant
constitutes
a
continuing
threat.
and
certainly
that
is
less
objective
than
the
standard
that
we
have
here
before
this
court
wherein
you
can
look
at
the
killer's
intent,
or
you
can
look
at
the
suffering
endured,
be
it
psychological
or
physical
suffering.
