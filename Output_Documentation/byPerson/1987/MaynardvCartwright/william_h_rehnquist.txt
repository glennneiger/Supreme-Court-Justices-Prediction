we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
87-519,
gary
maynard
v.
william
cartwright.
ms.
dickerson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
dickerson.
ms.
welch,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
there
must
have
been
an
intent
to
torture?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
don't
want
a
whole
new
body
of
law--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--just
repeating
of
the
elements
of
murder,
i
wouldn't
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
welch,
in
godfrey,
the
plurality
opinion,
after
having
analyzed
the
legal
aspect,
said
that
the
facts
of
that
case
could
not
be
brought
under
the
outrageously
wanton,
vile,
et
cetera.
now
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion
in
this
case
did
not
track
godfrey
in
that
respect.
the
tenth
circuit
expressly
paid
it
wouldn't
decide
whether
on
the
facts
of
this
case
it
could
be
outrageously
wanton
or
vile.
why
do
you
suppose
the
tenth
circuit
refused
to
opine
on
that
subject
when
they
purported
to
be
following
godfrey?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
court
in
godfrey,
there
wasn't
any
court
opinion
in
godfrey,
was
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there
wasn't
any
court
opinion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
was
still
relying
on
godfrey,
if
not
on
cartwright.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
welch.
your
time
has
expired.
ms.
dickerson,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
dickerson.
the
case
is
submitted.
