ms.
mandy
welch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
was
some
questions
asked
of
ms.
dickerson
which
i
would
like
to
respond
to,
and
hopefully
clarify.
just
scalia,
you
inquired
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
jury
was
asked
to
take
into
consideration
the
suffering
of
ms.
riddle
in
its
consideration
of
the
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
aggravating
circumstance.
the
portion
of
the
state
argument
which
does
relate
to
this
aggravating
circumstance
appears
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
a
reading
of
that
will
demonstrate
that
the
state
did
not
at
all
rely
upon
the
treatment
of
mrs.
riddle
in
its
argument
or
allegations
that
this
crime,
the
murder
of
hugh
riddle,
was
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel.
it
was
noted
that
justice
tacha,
in
her
concurring
opinion
concurring
with
the
initial
decision
by
the
panel,
found
that
those
circumstances,
in
her
opinion,
could
distinguish
this
murder
from
other
murders,
and
noted
that
it
was
not
clear
in
her
mind
whether
or
not
oklahoma
directed
the
especially
heinous
circumstance
to
the
suffering
of
persons
other
than
the
murder
victim,
and
that
was
an
issue
which
we
were
asked
specifically
to
brief
on
rehearing
before
the
tenth
circuit.
and
when
the
tenth
circuit
considered
on
rehearing
the
interpretation
and
construction
of
this
aggravating
circumstance
in
mr.
cartwright's
case,
it
determined
that
oklahoma,
that
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
not
adopted
a
construction
of
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
which
provided
any
standard
that
guided
and
limited
a
jury's
discretion
to
impose
death.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes,
your
honor.
the
oklahoma
court
has
adopted
a
requirement
that
in
order
for
a
murder
to
be
heinous,
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
it
must
involve
torture
or
physical
abuse
of
the
victim,
the
murder
victim
preceding--
ms.
mandy
welch
--the
facts
in
stouffer
are
strikingly
similar
to
the
facts
in
mr.
cartwright's
case.
in
that
case
there
was
a
surviving
victim.
mr.
stouffer
was
convicted
of
shooting
with
intent
to
kill
in
connection
with
the
shooting
of
that
victim.
the
shooting
occurred
prior
to
the
shooting
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
ms.
reeves.
it
occurred
in
the
same
room.
mr.
ivans
was
shot
twice
by
mr.
stouffer
with
a
gun
that
mr.
stouffer
had
borrowed
under
some
pretense.
after
shooting
mr.
ivans,
he
turned
to
ms.
reeves
and
shot
her
through
her
hand
which
she
was
holding
up
to
protect
herself
from
the
attack.
and
then
he
turned
and
shot
mr.
reeves
again
in
the
face.
mr.
reeves
survived
and
was
able
to
call
the
officers
and
report
the
shooting
of
both
himself
and
ms.
reeves.
and
considering
whether
or
not
the
jury's
finding
met
the
standard
that
oklahoma
adopted,
it
pointed
out
that
the
suffering
of
the
murder
victim
did
not
meet
the
requirement
of
torture
or
serious
physical
abuse,
because
the
evidence
showed
that
she
died
shortly
after
being
shot.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mandy
welch
no,
i
don't...
we
do
not
content
that
the
tenth
circuit--
ms.
mandy
welch
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
ms.
mandy
welch
the
tenth
circuit
does
not
forbade
the
consideration--
ms.
mandy
welch
--the
state
opinion
does
not
take
into
consideration
the
suffering
of
a
surviving
victim
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
murder
was
heinous,
atrocious
or
cruel.
ms.
mandy
welch
the
surviving
victim
was
shot
three
times
in
the
stouffer
case.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes.
ms.
mandy
welch
they
did
not
address
psychological
torture
in
the
stouffer
case.
ms.
mandy
welch
they
didn't
say
it
was
irrelevant.
they
just
did
not
take
it
into
consideration.
they
did
not
address
the
treatment
of
mr.
reeves
when
it
decided
stouffer.
it
adopted
a
standard
which
says,
in
order
to
prove
that
a
murder
is
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel,
there
must
be
presence
of
torture
or
physical
abuse
of
the
victim
preceding
death.
it
did
not
take
into
consideration
and
did
not
discuss
the
impact
of
the
shooting
of
mr.
reeves
on
ms.
ivans.
ms.
mandy
welch
you
might
be
able
to--
ms.
mandy
welch
--you
might
be
able
to
take
into
account
a
suffering,
suffering
of
the
victim
if
it
falls
within
a
clearly
defined
standard
which
focuses
the
jury
on
that
aspect
of
the
murder.
but,
in
my
opinion,
the
language
torture
or
serious
physical
abuse
of
the
victim
would
not
focus
the
jury's
attention
on
the
malsuffering
which
is
not
caused
by
any
deliberate
intent
to
inflict
mental
or
physical
suffering
on
the
part
of
the
victim.
ms.
mandy
welch
i
don't
think
it
could
under...
i
think
constitutionally
i
think
it
could
under
a
standard
that
focuses
the
jury
on
that
aspect
of
the
murder.
ms.
mandy
welch
constitutionally
i
think
it
could
if
the
court
adopts
a
standard
which
clearly
focuses
the
sentencer
on
that
aspect
of
the
murder.
but
i
do
not
think,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
that
the
standard
oklahoma
has
adopted--
ms.
mandy
welch
--treats
it
that
way.
ms.
mandy
welch
i
do
not
think
that
the
circumstances
that
you
described
would
amount
to--
ms.
mandy
welch
--i
think
if
a--
ms.
mandy
welch
--an
impact
on
the
victim
and
torture
which
is
directed
toward
the
victim,
in
my
mind,
are
two
different
things.
and
if
when
the
court
focuses
on
torture
it
is
focusing
on
conduct
which
is
directed
at
causing
either--
ms.
mandy
welch
--under
the...
i
don't
think
there
has
to
be
an
intent,
because
the
court
also--
ms.
mandy
welch
--no.
ms.
mandy
welch
no,
no.
under
oklahoma's
standard,
it
requires
torture
or
serious
physical
abuse.
ms.
mandy
welch
no.
ms.
mandy
welch
no.
ms.
mandy
welch
or
serious
physical
abuse.
ms.
mandy
welch
to
the
extent
that--
ms.
mandy
welch
--as
torture
is
commonly
understood,
it
encompasses
acts
which
are
intended
to
or
which
knowingly
produce
extreme
suffering
beyond--
ms.
mandy
welch
--well,
i
suppose
it
could
be
construed
that
way.
i
don't
read
the--
ms.
mandy
welch
--no.
ms.
mandy
welch
no.
i
know
in
brown,
the
victim
in
brown
was
shot
seven
times,
and
it
was
unclear
as
to
whether
or
not
the...
when
the
fatal
shot
was
fired.
and
the
court
found
that
for
that
reason
they
could
not
uphold
a
jury's
finding,
because
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
victim
suffered
before
she
died.
in
that
case
the
victim
was
fleeing
from
her
husband
who
was
attempting
to
shoot
her,
which
would
indicate
that
there
was
at
least
that
amount
of
psychological
trauma
and
panic
that
would
accompany
a
person
who
knows
that
they
are
about
to
be
killed.
and
the
court
did
not
consider
that
to
amount
to
the
kind
of
suffering
that's
necessary
under
its
standard.
ms.
mandy
welch
i
think
that
states
can
adopt
standards
that
focus
on
things
other
than
the
murder.
and
that--
ms.
mandy
welch
--yes,
i
think
that
knowingly
creating
a
great
risk
of
death
could
very
well
apply
in
a
situation
where
the
murder
victim
did
not
know
or
was
not
involved
in
the
specific
act
that
created
the
great
risk
of
death.
in
fact,
that
was
true...
that
has
been
true
in
oklahoma
and
in
other
states.
i
think
the
fact
that
it
could
be
true
does
not
validate
an
application
of
a
vague,
unconstitutionally
vague
and
ambiguous
circumstance
just
because
some
other
state
might
have
adopted
or
because
oklahoma
constitutionally
could
adopt
a
standard
that
focused
the
jury's
attention
on
that
aspect
of
the
crime.
an
example
of
that
is
godfrey.
in
godfrey,
the
court
found
that
georgia
had
abandoned
its
previous
construction
of
its
outrageously
and
wantonly,
vile,
aggravating
circumstance,
and
that
based
upon
the
language
of
the
statute,
there
was
no
principled
way
to
distinguish
godfrey
from
other
murders,
but
it
noted
that
other
states
had
adopted
a
standard
which
made
the
killing
of
two
people
an
aggravating
circumstance
that
could
result
in
the
death
penalty.
since
georgia
had
not
adopted
that
aggravating
circumstance,
it
did
not
say
the
death
sentence
in
mr.
godfrey's
case.
ms.
mandy
welch
the
tenth
circuit
said
that
it
would
not
attempt
to
determine
whether
this
crime
was
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel,
because
it
didn't
see
that
as
its
responsibility.
in
godfrey,
the
court
was
able
to
say,
these
facts
don't
meet
godfrey's...
georgia's
standard
because
georgia
had
adopted
a
clearly
defined
standard.
oklahoma
had
not,
and
if
the
tenth
circuit
had
said
this
case
can
or
cannot
meet
a
constitutional
interpretation
of
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel,
it
would
in
effect
have
been
dictating
to
the
state
an
interpretation,
or
at
least
suggesting
to
the
state
an
interpretation
that
it
should
adopt.
what
the
tenth
circuit
did
was
tell
the
court,
you
have
not
adopted
any
standard.
we
cannot
identify
any
standard
in
your
construction
of
this
aggravating
circumstance
that
guides
or
limits
a
jury's
judgment.
and
under
gregg,
and
proffitt,
and
godfrey,
in
order
to
impose
the
death
sentence,
a
state
must
define
those
crimes
for
which
death
can
be
imposed
in
a
way
that
obviates
standardless
sentencing
discretion.
states
must
do
that
by
providing
standards,
clear
and
objective
standards
that
provide
specific
and
detailed
guidance.
what
the
tenth
circuit
said
was
oklahoma
had
not
done
that,
and
that
they
would
not
presume
to
tell
the
state
what
they
should
do
by
saying
whether
or
not
this
crime
would
fit
any
particular
constitutional
standard.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mandy
welch
no,
they
left
that
up
to
the
state
to
determine
under
the
state
laws.
ms.
mandy
welch
i
think
the
difference
between
godfrey
and--
ms.
mandy
welch
--okay.
i
think
they
anticipated
that
the
court
could,
if
state
law
permitted,
conduct
a
new
sentencing
hearing.
ms.
mandy
welch
under
a
new
standard,
yes.
ms.
mandy
welch
no.
oklahoma
amended
its
death
penalty
statutes.
ms.
mandy
welch
to
provide
for
a
resentencing
if
there
an
error
in
the
sentencing
stage.
in
the
same
amendment,
they
eliminated
proportionality
review.
ms.
mandy
welch
the
court
has--
ms.
mandy
welch
--yes,
and
the
court
has
held,
oklahoma
court
has
held
that
the
elimination
of
proportionality
review
is
retroactive,
but
they
have
not
held
that
the
resentencing
portion
of
it
is.
the
issue
is
before
the
court
but
they
have
not
definitively
resolved
that,
and
that's
what--
ms.
mandy
welch
--yes.
ms.
mandy
welch
well,
proffitt
approved
the
language
adopted
by
florida
courts
that
a
crime
must
be
unnecessarily
torturous
to
the
victim.
the
proffitt
opinion
does
not
even
quote
the
definitions.
it
does
refer
to
the
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
language
of
florida's
provision.
it
noted
that
the
terms
could
be
applied
to
many
murders.
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
proffitt
was
limited
to
the
consideration
of
the
constitutionality
of
florida's
death
penalty
statutes
as
a
whole.
and
it
reviewed
the
vagueness
challenges
to
the
aggravating
circumstances
only
to
the
extent
that
it
was
necessary
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
statute
in
its
entirety
promised
to
alleviate
the
risk
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
death
sentences.
and
it
approved
the
florida
statute
with
this
aggravating
circumstance
in
it,
considering
it
as
construed
by
the
florida
courts.
in
other
words,
as
limited
to
crimes
which
are
unnecessarily
torturous
to
the
victim.
the
irony
in
the
state's
position
is
that
it
is
seeking
constitutional
approval
of
a
subjective
and
standardless
sentencing
process
at
all
levels
of
the
capital
sentencing
process.
it
is
asking
the
court
to
approve
an
aggravating
circumstance
which
is
intended
under
oklahoma
law
to
limit
the
category
of
persons
eligible
for
the
death
sentence
which
does
not
in
fact
do
that.
oklahoma
law
relies
solely
on
aggravating
circumstances
to
define
those
crimes
which
are
eligible
for
the
death
sentence.
and
if
those
aggravating
circumstances
do
not
guide
an
limit
the
jury's
discretion
to
impose
death,
then
sentencing
discretion
is
left
unfettered
and
it
becomes
impossible
to
determine
how
a
particular
case
differs
in
any
principled
way
from
any
other
cases.
it
is
also
impossible
under
such
an
aggravating
circumstance
to
determine
the
basis
on
which
a
particular
jury
finds
that
a
particular
person
is
eligible
for
the
death
sentence,
and
it
is
impossible
to
determine
the
basis
on
which
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
upholds
the
finding
of
the
jury.
the
arguments
which
are
advanced
by
the
state
are
premised
upon
a
misreading
of
the
tenth
circuit's
decision.
the
state's
arguments
also
reflect
a
disregard
for
the
reasons
behind
the
constitutional
requirement
that
states
guide
and
limit
the
capital
sentencer's
discretion
to
impose
death.
the
decisions
of
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
are
based
upon
constitutional
principles
that
this
court
adopted
in
gregg
and
proffitt,
a
requirement
that
states
limits
sentencer's
judgments
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
person
is
eligible
for
the
death
sentence,
an
which
were
relied
upon
by
the
court
in
godfrey
and
have
been
reaffirmed
by
this
court's
decisions
through
lowenfield.
ms.
mandy
welch
there
was
a
plurality
opinion
and
i
believe
justice
brennan
and
justice
marshall,
in
a
concurring
opinion,
concurred
with
the
finding
of
the
plurality
that
georgia's
construction
of
the
aggravating
circumstance
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
ms.
mandy
welch
no,
there
was
a
plurality
opinion.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mandy
welch
to
the
question
of
vagueness,
yes.
ms.
mandy
welch
yes.
ms.
mandy
welch
well,
if
the
court
continues
to
apply
it,
the
state
could
resist
that
and
present
its
arguments
on
direct
appeal
on
rehearing.
and
if
it
were
to
lose,
it
could
file
a
petition
for
certiorari.
ms.
mandy
welch
in
a
later
case.
ms.
mandy
welch
well--
ms.
mandy
welch
--if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
the
court's
position...
i
mean
to
the
state's
position
that
this
is
a
response
to
a
tenth
circuit's
decision
which
they
have
considered
binding
and
that
they
can't
get
away
from.
in
stouffer,
the
court
merely
noted
that
the
cartwright
decision
held
that
the
aggravating
circumstance
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
in
brown,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
specifically
said,
we
agree
with
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
that
our
past
construction
of
this
circumstance
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
and
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
a
history
of
disagreeing
with
decisions
of
federal
courts
and
the
supreme
court.
and
when
it
has
felt--
ms.
mandy
welch
--right.
and
when
it
is
felt
compelled
to
follow
along
with
a
decision
that
it
disagreed
with,
it
has
been
quick
to
state
that.
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
i
believe
there
was
a
question
asked
i
believe
by
justice
o'connor
earlier
about
whether
or
not
the
oklahoma
court's
decision
rested
solely
upon
federal
constitutional
grounds.
and
if
i
recall,
the
response
was
that
it
rested
on
cartwright
v.
maynard.
oklahoma
did
its
own
analysis
of
the
opinion
of
godfrey,
and
looked
at
its
previous
construction
of
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel,
and
said
we
find
that
our
reliance
upon
the
terms
of
the
statute
in
these
definitions
did
not
guide
the
jury.
ms.
mandy
welch
that
is
correct.
it
did
rely
upon
godfrey,
but
it
relied
upon
its
analysis
of
godfrey,
and
just
as
important,
it
relied
upon
its
analysis
of
oklahoma
law
which
was
applied
in
cartwright.
it
noted
that
the
construction
which
it
did
not
think
guided
and
limited
juries
was
applied
in
mr.
cartwright's
case.
and
when
it
adopted
a
standard,
it
didn't
cite
cartwright
v.
maynard.
it
cited
an
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
decision,
odum
v.
state,
in
which
it
said
it
had
previously
relied
upon
that
standard,
but
obviously
had
not
continued
to
construe
the
statute
in
that
limiting
fashion.
the
state's
arguments
also
reflect
a
disregard
for
the
reasons
behind
the
constitutional
requirement
of
the
state's
guide,
and
limits
sentencer's
discretion
and
a
lack
of
understanding
for
the
differences
between
the
various
stages
of
a
capital
sentencing
process;
differences
which
have
resulted
in
part
from
the
state's
efforts
and
this
court's
efforts
to
balance
the
need
for
uniformity
and
predictability
that
is
essential
in
avoiding
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
decisions
to
impose
death,
and
the
equally
important
necessity
that
jurors
have
unlimited
discretion
to
consider
mitigating
circumstances
which
may
prevent
or
result
in
a
decision
not
to
impose
death.
standardless
decisionmaking
is
the
essence
of
arbitrariness.
both
the
oklahoma
court
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
have
agreed
that
that
oklahoma's
past
construction
did
not
limit
or
guide
a
jury's
discretion
to
impose
death
in
oklahoma.
and
they
recognized
that
in
order
to
avoid...
in
order
for
standards
to
avoid
the
risk
of
arbitrary
application,
those
standards
just
be
susceptible
