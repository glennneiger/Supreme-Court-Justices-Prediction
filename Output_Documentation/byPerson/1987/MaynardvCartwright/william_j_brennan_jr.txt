justice
jr.
ms.
dickerson,
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals,
the
new
standard,
as
i
understand
their
opinion,
is
that
only
where
there
is
evidence
that
the
death
of
the
murder
victim
was
preceded
by
torture
or
serious
physical
abuse.
now,
that
was
not
something
prescribed
by
the
tenth
circuit,
was
it?
justice
jr.
i
gather
all
that
the
tenth
circuit
did
really
was
to
say
that,
as
a
whole,
the
past
construction
of
the
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
aggravating
circumstance
was
unconstitutionally
vague;
wasn't
that
it?
justice
jr.
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
agreed
that,
yes,
it
was.
and
then
they
established
this
new
standard;
is
that
a--
justice
jr.
--yes,
tell
me,
what
does
that
do
to
your
case?
justice
jr.
but
i
gather
were
this
case
to
come
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
at
this
time,
that
standard
would
say
that
the
death
penalty
could
not
be
imposed
in
this
case.
justice
jr.
ms.
dickerson,
getting
back
to
the
question
i
asked
you
earlier,
under
the
new
standard
i
think
you
answered
me
that
psychological...
what
did
you
say,
psychological
torture
or
something?
justice
jr.
well,
the
way
this
reads
is...
i'm
quoting
from
it,
"only
where
there
is
evidence
that
the
death
of
the
murder
victim
was
preceded
by
torture
or
serious
physical
abuse.
"
you
are
suggesting
to
me
that
torture
means
psychological
torture?
justice
jr.
what
about
your
court?
justice
jr.
in
any
event,
i
gather
that
so
far
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
not
addressed
psychological
torture,
has
it?
justice
jr.
in
any
case.
