justice
o'connor
ms.
dickerson,
have
the
appellate
courts
in
oklahoma
since
this
court
was
decided,
specifically
i
think
in
the
stouffer
case
and
the
brown
case,
recently
adopted
the
tenth
circuit's
view
of
the
requirements
for
narrowing
the
especially
heinous,
aggravating
circumstance?
justice
o'connor
was
that
decision,
those
decisions
a
matter
based
on
both
state
and
federal
law,
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
that
was
a
dissent,
wasn't
it?
justice
o'connor
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
godfrey?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
sounds
very
much,
to
me,
like
it
would
be
necessary
to
reach
the
result
you
are
asking
for.
how
do
you
distinguish
godfrey?
justice
o'connor
other
than
by
reliance
upon
the
dissenting
opinion.
justice
o'connor
ms.
welch,
has
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
adopted
a
standard
now
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
o'connor
and
it's
your
position
that
they
have
made
clear
under
stouffer
and
brown
that
it
would
not
be
relevant
to
consider
what
happened
to
another
potential
victim
in
the
incident?
justice
o'connor
so
it's
your
position
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
in
oklahoma
it
is
not
possible
to
rely
on
what
happened
in
this
case
to
mrs.
riddle.
