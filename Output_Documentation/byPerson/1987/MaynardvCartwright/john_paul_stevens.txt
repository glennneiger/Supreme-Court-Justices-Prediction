justice
stevens
may
i
ask
about
mrs.
riddle?
is
it
your
understanding
of
the
facts
that
the
shooting
of
mrs.
riddle,
the
defendant
was
trying
to
kill
her
when
he
shot
her?
justice
stevens
the
question
i
suppose
i
am
wrestling
with,
because
i
have
the
same
concern
justice
scalia
does,
should
one
view
the
attack
on
mrs.
riddle
as
an
attempt
to
torture
her
and
cause
her
to
suffer
unnecessary
pain
before
she
would
die,
or
was
it
just
that
he
was
kind
of
bungling
the
job
of
trying
to
kill
her?
he
hit
her
legs
instead
of
shooting
a
fatal
shot,
and
he
failed
to
kill
her
by
stabbing
here,
but
he
wasn't
just
trying
to
inflict
pain
that
would
not
result
in
death.
what
position
did
the
state
take
at
the
trial?
justice
stevens
did
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument
explain
why
the
state
thought
this
was
cruel,
unusual
and
atrocious?
justice
stevens
what
would
your
view
if...
as
a
matter
of
the
law.
assume
the
facts
were
clear,
and
they
never
are
as
clear
as
we
make
them
in
our
hypothetical
question,
but
assume
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
defendant
had
tried
to
kill
mrs.
riddle
as
promptly
and
efficiently
as
he
could,
but
he
missed
and
he
was
just
a
bungler
and
caused
her
to
suffer
the
equivalent
of
the
same
kind
of
physical
torture
that
if
he
was
just
trying
to
do.
would
that
satisfy
the
aggravating
circumstance?
justice
stevens
so
that
you
don't
focus
really
on
the
mental
state
of
the
defendant,
but
rather,
on
the
pain
suffered
by
the
victim.
it
really
doesn't
matter
whether
he
was
deliberately
a
malicious
sort
of
person
or
just
a
bungler.
that
really
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
have
to
look
at
it
is
what
i
am
asking,
in
your
view.
the
element
doesn't
focus
on
the
defendant's
mental
state,
in
your...
it
focuses,
rather,
on
the
impact
of
the
hardship
on
the
victim.
justice
stevens
either
one
would
be
sufficient.
