justice
white
well,
they
not
only
reinterpreted
the
statute
in
that
case,
but
they
undertook...
the
appellate
court
itself
took
a
weighing,
didn't
it?
justice
white
which
it
did
not
do
in
this
case.
justice
white
and
until
then,
it
had
not
been
doing
that.
justice
white
and
instead,
they
ordered
a
resentencing
hearing.
justice
white
oh,
i
see.
justice
white
it
would
be
life
then.
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
now
they
reweigh
it.
justice
white
and
they
might...
and
in
a
case
like
this,
they
might
affirm
a
death
sentence
even
in
the
face
of
an
invalid
circumstance.
justice
white
well,
that
would
seem
to...
you
would
also
argue
then
that
that
opinion
for
bad...
construing
torture
to
include
psychological
torture.
justice
white
well,
what
other
kind
of
torture
would
it
be
in
that
case
just
because
the
lady
saw
somebody
else
being
shot?
justice
white
what
was
it
you
said
the
opinion
for
bad
referring
to?
justice
white
i
know,
in
the
state
case
justice
o'connor
was
asking
you
about.
justice
white
okay.
i
think
justice
white's
point
is
that
the
only
suffering
that
could
have
been
incurred
by
the
surviving
victim
there
was
psychological
suffering,
psychological
torture.
justice
white
--so
you
say
that
might
be
taken
into
account.
in
the
case
before
us
now,
the
fact
that
the...
you
could
take
into
account
the
effect
on
the
husband
of
the
treatment
of
his
wife--
justice
white
--prior
to
his
being
shot.
justice
white
well,
an
intruder
in
a
bedroom
in
a
home
clearly
tortures
the
wife
before
he
kills
her,
or
before
he...
he
doesn't
kill
her
but
he
then
turns
around
and
kills
the
husband
instantly.
now
could
the
jury's
attention
properly
be
focused
on
the
effect
of
the
torture
of
the
wife
on
the
victim?
justice
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
white
oh,
by
the
way...
well,
you
say
under
the
state
adopted
standard,
you
may
not
consider
psychological
torture?
justice
white
what
other
kind
of
torture
is
it?
justice
white
as
justice
scalia
asked
you,
what
other
kind
of
an
impact
on
the
victim
could
there
have
been
except
mental?
justice
white
by
the
way,
what
is
the
difference
between
those
two
under...
torture,
do
you
think
torture
has
to
be
physical?
justice
white
it
does
not?
justice
white
so
it's
an
"or".
torture
or.
justice
white
so
it
must
have--
justice
white
--why
would
they
even
use
torture
unless
the
word
"torture",
it's
just
repetitive
of
serious
physical
abuse
except
for
psychological
torture.
justice
white
well,
that
would
always
be
serious
physical
abuse
except
for
psychological
torture.
justice
white
so
what
was
the
tenth
circuit's
ultimate
judgment?
they
enjoined
the
execution
of
petitioner
under
the
invalid
death
sentence,
and
this
judgment
is
without
prejudice
to
further
proceedings
by
the
state
for
a
redetermination
of
the
sentence
on
conviction.
justice
white
so
it
did
not
anticipate
that
there
was
going
to
be
an
automatic
life
sentence.
justice
white
i
take
it
then
that
it
anticipated
that
if
the
state
court
adopted
a
narrowing,
if
on
remand
on
this
very
proceedings
they
adopted
a
narrowing
construction,
a
satisfactory
narrowing
instruction,
that
there
could
be
a
death
sentence
imposed?
justice
white
well,
how
about
just
answering
my
question.
justice
white
under
a
new
standard
that
they
would
adopt
in
this
case.
justice
white
well,
then
what
did
they
mean
in
footnote
8,
"we
express
no
opinion
concerning
the
constitutionality
of
a
retroactive
application
of
oklahoma's
new
remand
procedure?
"
does
that
refer
to
the
reweighing?
justice
white
yes?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
oh,
that's
what
they
referred
to.
justice
white
but
anyway,
you
think
the
tenth
circuit
anticipated
a
new
sentencing
hearing
at
which
a
proper
standard
could
be
applied.
justice
white
did
you
mean
the
gregg
case?
justice
white
to
the
vagueness
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
maynard
case
87-519,
we
affirm
unanimously
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
marshall
has
joined
that
opinion.
