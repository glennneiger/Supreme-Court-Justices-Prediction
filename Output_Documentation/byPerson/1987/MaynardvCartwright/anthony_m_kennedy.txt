justice
kennedy
if
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
says
a
statute
is
vague,
and
the
state
reinterprets
it,
the
state
is
telling
us
what
it
means
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
and
that
is
an
interpretation
that
is
binding
on
us.
justice
kennedy
well,
they
could
have
said
that
they
can't
save
the
statute.
they
could
have
said,
we
cannot
construe
the
statute
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
send
it
back
to
the
legislature,
but
they
didn't.
the
reconstrued
it
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
we
have
to
accept
that.
that's
what
the
statute
means
in
oklahoma
now.
justice
kennedy
well,
we
are
back
to
where
we
started.
is
it
your
position,
ms.
dickerson,
that
if
this
court
were
to
disagree
with
the
tenth
circuit
on
the
federal
constitutional
issue,
then
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
take
a
different
view
of
how
the
statute
should
be
construed?
