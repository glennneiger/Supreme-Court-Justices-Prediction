well,
even
accepting
what
the
jury
found,
that
there
was
no
reputational
injury
here
because
there
was
no
believable
fact
asserted,
for
you
to
win,
you
have
to
say
that
opinion
or
parody
is
never
actionable,
even
though
it's
done
intentionally
for
the
purpose
of
inflicting
emotional
distress.
that's
your
proposition,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it,
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
i
agree
with
that,
because
that's
what
the
jury
found.
justice
byron

white
all
right.
include
that,
and
then
you
say,
parody
or
opinion
about
a
public
figure
is
never
actionable
even
though
it's
done
intentionally
for
the
purpose
of
causing
emotional
distress,
that's
your
proposition.
justice
byron

sure,
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
proposition.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
certainly
it's
arguable
that
we
must
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
fact
involved.
you
say
the
jury
said
there
wasn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
judge
the
case
on
that
basis,
then
your
proposition
is
there
can't
be
any
liability
here
at
all,--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
there's
a
public
figure
involved.
would
you
say
if
there
wasn't
a
public
figure
involved,
that
we
could
sustain
this
judgment?
let's
assume
it
was
not
a
public
figure.
no
believable
or
nothing
that
was
said
that
could
be
interpreted
as
a
fact,
and
so
there
would
be
no
libel,
no
reputational
injury.
if
there
was
not
a
public
figure
involved,
you
would
say
the
judgment
would
stand,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
haven't
mentioned
it,
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
grutman,
you're
certainly
posing
a
much
broader
proposition
than
is
necessary
for
you
to
win
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
way
you
put
it
from
the
very
outset,
you
put
it
the
same
way.
we're
judging
this
case
on
the
basis
that
the
jury
found
that
no
one
could
reasonably
have
believed
that
this
was
a
statement
of
fact.
that's
the
way
we
judge
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
make
out
of
the
special
verdict
the
jury
returned?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
why
you
insist
on
this
because
if
there's
anything
factual
about
this
statement,
you
certainly
have
to
contend
with
new
york
times.
and
if
there's
nothing
factual
about
it,
you
don't
have
to
contend
with
it
at
all.
all
you
have
to
say
or
all
you
have
to
win,
which
is
plenty,
that
using
opinion
or
parody
to
inflict
emotional
distress
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
which
is
a
considerably
different
proposition
than
what
you've
been
pushing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
say
you
put
it,
we
don't
need
any
new
law
for
that.
that's
just...
new
york
times
wouldn't
insulate
any
statement
of
fact
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
these
were
factual
statements
like
you
mentioned,
you
could
win
under
new
york
times
any
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
i
was
in
dissent.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
doubt
it.
