justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
isaacman,
what
the
new
york
times
rule
provides
is
not
an
absolute
protection,
but
what
a
knowing
element,
an
element
of
specific
intent
to
create
a
falsehood.
it
doesn't
give
an
absolute
privilege
to
state
falsehood.
it
just
says
the
falsehood
is
okay
unless
there's
an
intent.
now,
here
we
have
a
state
tort
that
is
specifically
an
intentional
tort.
there
must
be
an
intent
to
create
the
emotional
distress,
so
it
really
is
not
quite
the
same
category
of
opening
up
that
you're
making
it
out
to
be.
it's
just
the
issue
is
whether
the
intent
element
is
enough
to
provide
a
major
exception
from
new
york
times
is
also
enough
to
make
a
major
exception
for
purposes
of
this
tort
action.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
you
can
draw
the
line
there.
but
all
new
york
times
says
is
if
you
state
falsehood
with
knowledge
of
the
falsehood
intent
to
be
false,
the
first
amendment
does
prevent
it.
all
i'm
asking
you
is
why
can't
that
principle
be
extended
to
say
you
can
cause
emotional
harm
to
your
heart's
content,
just
as
you
can
state
falsity
to
your
heart's
content,
but
where
you
intend
to
create
that
emotional
harm,
we
have
a
different
situation.
isn't
that
a
possible
line?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be.
my
only
point
is
new
york
times,
it
seems
to
me,
doesn't
speak
to
it.
new
york
times
says
intent
is
okay,
is
enough
to
get
you
out
of
it.
what
you're
saying
is,
this
kind
of
intent
shouldn't
be
enough,
intent
to
cause
harm
shouldn't
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
isaacman,
to
contradict
vince
lombardi,
the
first
amendment
is
not
everything.
it's
a
very
important
value,
but
it's
not
the
only
value
in
our
society,
certainly.
you're
giving
us
no
help
in
trying
to
balance
it,
it
seems
to
me,
against
another
value
which
is
that
good
people
should
be
able
to
enter
public
life
and
public
service.
the
rule
you
give
us
says
that
if
you
stand
for
public
office,
or
become
a
public
figure
in
any
way,
you
cannot
protect
yourself,
or
indeed,
your
mother,
against
a
parody
of
your
committing
incest
with
your
mother
in
an
outhouse.
now,
is
that
not
a
value
that
ought
to
be
protected?
do
you
think
george
washington
would
have
stood
for
public
office
if
that
was
the
consequence?
and
there's
no
way
to
protect
the
values
of
the
first
amendment
and
yet
attract
people
into
public
service?
can't
you
give
us
some
line
that
would
balance
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
handle
that.
i
think
george
could
handle
that.
but
that's
a
far
cry
from
committing
incest
with
your
mother
in
an
outhouse.
i
mean,
there's
no
line
between
the
two?
we
can't
protect
that
kind
of
parody
and
not
protect
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
often
do
you
think
you're
going
to
be
able
to
get
a
jury
to
find
that
it
was
done
with
the
intent
of
creating
emotional
distress.
i
mean,
there
is
that
finding
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
grutman,
you're
given
us
a
lot
of
words
to
describe
this:
outrageous,
heinous,--
justice
antonin
scalia
--repulsive
and
loathsome.
i
don't
know,
maybe
you
haven't
looked
at
the
same
political
cartoons
that
i
have,
but
some
of
them,
and
a
long
tradition
of
this,
not
just
ion
this
country
but
back
into
english
history,
i
mean,
politicians
depicted
as
horrible
looking
beasts,
and
you
talk
about
portraying
someone
as
committing
some
immoral
act.
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
there
were
not
a
number
of
cartoons
depicting
one
or
another
political
figure
as
at
least
the
piano
player
in
a
bordello.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
can
you
give
us
something
that
the
cartoonist
or
the
political
figure
can
adhere
to,
other
than
such
general
words
as
heinous
and
what
not.
i
mean,
does
it
depend
on
how
ugly
the
beast
is,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
give
me
a
statement
that
isn't
a
statement
of
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
give
me
a
statement
that
isn't
a
statement
of
fact
in
your
interpretation
of
what
statement
of
fact
means.
i
mean,
when
you
say,
statement
of
fact,
it
means
true
fact,
or
it
means
nothing
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's
no
statement
that
is
not
a
statement
of
fact
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
grutman,
i
think
it
would
be
a
different...
you
know,
if
there
were
a
virginia
statute
saying,
you
know,
it's
tortious
to
depict
someone
as
committing
incest,
then
you
know,
the
cartoonist
knows
that
he's
up
against.
but
just
to
say
heinous
and
just
leave
it
to
the
jury.
you
think,
for
example,
it
isn't
only
the
incest
that
offends
you,
you
think
that
portraying
a
baptist
minister
as
having
taken
a
shot
or
two
before
he
went
on
to
the
pulpit,
that
that
would
quality
in
your
notion
as
heinous?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
that's
debatable?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
common
law
hasn't
had
this
tort.
justice
antonin
scalia
since
1984
as
applied
to
this
field
do
you
tell
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
isn't
blackstone.
i
mean,
this
is
pretty
new,
all
of
it,
isn't
it?
