mr.
norman
roy
grutman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
deliberate,
malicious
character
assassination
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
deliberate,
malicious
character
assassination
is
what
was
proven
in
this
case.
by
the
defendant's
own
explicit
admission,
the
publication
before
this
court
was
the
product
of
a
deliberate
plan
to
assassinate,
to
upset
the
character
and
integrity
of
the
plaintiff,
and
to
cause
him
severe
emotional
disturbance
with
total
indifference
then
and
now
to
the
severity
of
the
injury
caused.
when
the
publication
was
protested
by
the
bringing
of
this
lawsuit,
the
unregenerate
defendant
published
it
again.
justice
scalia,
i'd
like
to
answer
a
question
that
you
raised
with
my
adversary.
how
often
are
you
going
to
be
able
to
get
proof
like
this.
i
dare
say,
very
infrequently,
and
i
dare
say
that
the
kind
of
behavior
with
which
the
court
is
confronted
is
aberrational.
this
is
not
the
responsible
publisher.
this
is
the
wanton,
reckless,
deliberately
malicious
publisher
who
sets
out
for
the
sheer
perverse
joy
of
simply
causing
injury
to
abuse
the
power
that
he
has
as
a
publisher.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
don't
think
so
in
that
case
because
what
was
being
done
by
the
newspapers
in
that
case
was
reporting
the
truth,
the
truth
about
a
public
figure
who
was
a
candidate
for
public
office.
the
context
in
which
the
publications
about
gary
hart
appeared
cannot
really
be
compared
favorably
with
what
was
done
here.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
under
the
theory
of
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
even
the
truth
can
be
used
in
such
a
way
if
it
is
used
in
some
outrageous
way,
it
must
be
something
which
is
so
repellent--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--if
the
jury
were
able
to
find
from
the
evidence,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
publication
was
outrageous...
i
would
doubt
that
they
would
find
that
because
it
is
not
that
kind
of
conduct...
reporting
the
truth.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
only
in
a
highly
theoretical
sense,
if
the
animating
purpose
behind
the
publisher
was
simply
to
inflict
intense
and
severe
emotional
distress
upon
gary
hart.
but
i
think
that's
really
not
the
issue.
the
focus
in
this
court,
which
is
not
the
court
of
libel,
the
focus
is
on
the
harm
which
is
inflicted
on
the
victim.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
only
in
the
event
that
the
cartoon
constitutes
that
kind
of
depiction
which
would
be
regarded
by
the
average
member
of
the
community
as
so
intolerable
that
no
civilized
person
should
have
to
bear
it.
that's
the
definition
of
the
court.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
indeed,
but
i
was
answering
the
question
of
justice
o'connor.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no.
i'd
like
to
address
that
point,
justice
white,
because
i
think
a
kind
of
semantic
conundrum
has
been
presented
here
when
counsel
says
that
there
was
no
statement
of
fact.
there
was
a
statement
of
fact.
just
as
we
argued
in
our
brief,
you
could
state
gravity
causes
things
to
fly
upward.
that
is
a
statement
of
fact.
it's
just
a
false
statement
of
fact.
and
if
one
consults
the
record--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--i
make
out
of
it
the
fact
that
the
jury
said
that
this
was
not
describing
actual
facts
about
the
plaintiff
or
actual
events
in
which
the
plaintiff
participated.
that
is
a
finding
that
what
the
statement
was
in
the
publication
was
false.
perhaps
we
should
have
appealed
that.
that's
a
finding
of
falsity
which
is
all
that
we
needed
to
prove
to
sustain
libel.
but
we
did
not
appeal
that,
and
that
question
is
not
before
the
court.
but
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
find
that
the
meaning
of
the
answer
to
that
question
only
goes
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
jury
thought
that
reverend
falwell--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--i
agree
that
parody
or
so-called
satire,
whatever
it
calls
itself,
is
not
necessarily
protected
speech
when
the
purpose
of
the
publisher
is
to
inflict
severe
emotional
distress.
and
while
the
contention
is
made
in
the
argument
that
you've
heard
this
morning
that
this
was
a
parody,
i
think
that
the
jury
could
properly
examine
this
and
recognize
it
for
what
it
is.
a
fig
leaf
isn't
going
to
protect
this
kind
of
a
publication
from
being
recognized
as
the
kind
of
behavior
with
which
the
tort
of
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
is
intended
to
deal.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no.
two
things
must
conjoin.
what
you
have
to
have
is
an
irresponsible
intention
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
inflict
injury.
that's
only
one
half
of
it.
the
other
is
that
what
the
cartoonist,
the
writer
or
the
speaker
does,
constitutes
in
the
mind
of
the
community,
an
utterance
of
such
enormity,
such
a
heinous
kind
of
utterance,
usually
false,
that
nobody
should
have
to
bear
that
if
the
purpose
was
to
inflict
severe
emotional
injury,
and
severe
emotional
injury
results.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no.
it
does
not,
unless
what
he
depicts
is
something
like
showing
the
man
committing
incest
with
his
mother
when
that's
not
true,
or
molesting
children
or
running
a
bordello
or
selling
narcotics.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
well,
the
state
of
mind
is
precisely
what
we're
concerned
with.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no,
it
would
not.
if
the
man
sets
out
with
the
purpose
of
simply
making
a
legitimate
aesthetic,
political
or
some
other
kind
of
comment
about
the
person
about
whom
he
was
writing
or
drawing,
and
that
is
not
an
outrageous
comment,
then
there's
no
liability.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
it
has
to
be...
correct,
because
you
cannot
have
emotional
distress
for
mere
slights,
for
the
kinds
of
things
which
people
in
an
imperfect
world
have
got
to
put
up
with,
calling
somebody
some
of
the
epithets
that
were
mentioned
in
the
opposing
argument,
blackmailer,
or
some
other
conclusory
and
highly
pejorative
terms,
an
epithet,
but
when
you
say
not
that
you
are
some
foul
conclusory
term,
but
when
you
depict
someone
in
the
way
in
which
jerry
falwell
was
depicted
with
all
of
the
hallmarks
of
reality
including
the
pirated
copyright
and
the
pirated
trademark
so
that
the
casual
reader
looking
at
it
could
think
this
is
for
real,
that
rises
to
the
level
of--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--i
do
not
think
so,
or
it's
a
much
harder
case.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
justice
stevens,
mr.
flint
republished
it
for
a
third
time
after
the
jury
verdict.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
liability
requires
an
intent.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
do,
i
do
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
agree
that
intent...
this
is
why
this
is
such
a
rare
tort.
this
is,
as
i've
suggested,
an
intersticial
tort.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
repulsive
and
loathsome.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
justice
scalia,
we
don't
shoot
the
piano
player.
i
understand
that.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no,
it's
not
the
amount
of
hair
the
beast
has
or
how
long
his
claws
may
be.
i
believe
that
this
is
a
matter
of
an
evolving
social
sensibility.
between
the
1700s
and
today,
i
would
suggest,
that
people
have
become
more
acclimatized
to
the
use
of
the
kinds
of
language
or
the
kinds
of
things
that
had
they
been
depicted
at
an
earlier
age
would
have
been
regarded
as
socially
unacceptable.
and
while
that
evolutionary
change
is
taking
place,
and
it's
a
salutary
thing,
there
are
certain
kinds
of
things.
it's
difficult
to
describe
them.
this
court
struggled
for
years
to
put
a
legal
definition
on
obscenity,
and
justice
stewart
could
say
no
more
than,
i
know
what
it
is
when
i
see
it.
well,
this
kind
of
rare
aberrational
and
anomalous
behavior,
whatever
it
is,
whatever
the
verbal
formulation
that
the
nine
of
you
may
come
upon,
clearly
it
can
be
condensed
in
the
form
of
words
that
i
used,
which
are
not
mine...
they
belong
to
the
oracles
of
the
restatement...
who
have
tried
to
say
that
it
is
for
the
jury
to
decide
whether
or
not
what
is
being
depicted
is
done
is
so
an
offensive,
so
awful
and
so
horrible
a
way,
that
it
constitutes
the
kind
of
behavior
that
nobody
should
have
to
put
up
with.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
frankly
think
that
it
isn't
too
much
to
expect,
justice
o'connor,
that
a
responsible
author,
artist,
or
anyone
would
understand
that
attempting
to
falsely
depict
as
a
representational
fact
that
someone
is
committing
incest
with
his
mother
in
an
outhouse
and
saying
that
she's
a
whore,
and
that
when
the
person
involved
is
an
abstemious
baptist
minister,
that
he
always
gets
drunk
before
he
goes
into
the
pulpit,
it
isn't
too
much
to
say
that
anybody
who
would
do
that
ought
to
take
the
consequences
for
casting
that
into
the
stream.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
justice
white,
i
don't
think
this
case
is
governed
by
the
new
york
times
rule.
when
i
tried
this
case,
we
were
living
in
the
heyday
of
gertz
and
we
had
not
yet
had
this
court's
decision
in
dunn
&
bradstreet
or
in
philadelphia
newspaper
v.
hepps.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
we
are
covered
by
your
decisions
in
those
cases.
this
is
not
speech
that
matters.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
speech
that
is
to
be
protected.
the
new
york
times
rule
is
not
a
universal
nostrum.
it
is
a
rule
that
you
formulated
to
meet
a
constitutional
crisis
in
which
truth,
which
is
irrelevant
here.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
yes,
we
could
win
under
new
york
times,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
as
a
jurist
prudential
matter,
the
new
york
times
formulation
of
actual
malice
is
inappropriate
and
irrelevant
for
this
tort
for
the
reason
that
when
you're
dealing
with
the
tort
of
libel,
the
focus
of
inquiry,
the
gravamen
is
on
the
issue
of
true
or
falsity
in
which
facts
become
the
measure
of
what
is
true
or
false,
or
something
which
has
been
dealt
with
recklessly.
the
gravamen
of
this,
as
i
say,
intersticial
tort
is
on
the
harm
that
was
inflicted
on
the
victim,
and
the
constitutional
measure
here
is
intentionality.
it's
what
this
court
said
in
the
dissent
of
chief
justice
rehnquist,
we're
really
dealing
with
whether
you
call
it,
scienter
or
mens
rea.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
disagree,
justice
o'connor,
and
if
you'll
give
me
a
moment...
that
is
the
easy
way
of
looking
at
it,
but
that's
not
what
they
said.
the
question
answered
is,
can
this
be
understood
as
describing
actual...
meaning
truth...
actual
facts
about
plaintiff
or
actual
events
in
which
plaintiff
participated.
and
they
said,
no.
that
to
me
means
that
they
said
this
is
not
a
true
statement
of
fact,
but
it's
nonetheless
a
statement
of
fact
for
the
purposes
of
new
york
times
or
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
pardon?
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no.
that
is
the
aristotelian
interpretation
of
a
statement
of
fact
as
propounded
by
professors
wexler
and
michael
in
their
famous
monograph,
but
in
the
common
parlance
in
which
we
speak,
a
statement
of
fact
is
an
utterance
about
either
an
event
or
a
thing
or
a
person
which
can
be
proven
either
true
or
false.
if
it's
true,
then
it's
a
true
fact,
but
if
it's
false,
like
gravity
causes
things
to
float
upward...
that's
a
statement
of
fact,
but
it's
manifestly
false.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
that's
correct.
however,
there
may
be
statements...
that's
an
interesting
philosophical
question
that
we
could
explore
endlessly,
but--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--candidly,
i
must
say
that
i
do
not
think
that
the
fourth
circuit
made
the
point
which
i
first
tried
to
make
to
justice
o'connor,
and
which
i
am
making
to
you:
in
retrospect,
i
believe
we
could
have
appealed
this
as
a
proper
basis
for
libel
with
that
finding.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
but
i
didn't
and
that's
therefore
it
wasn't
before
the
fourth
circuit,
and
it's
not
before
you
now.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
that
is
the
way
it
looks
in
the
cold
light
in
the
supreme
court
today.
i
remember
that
at
the
time
that
those
jury
instructions
were
being
fought
over
in
the
pit
of
the
trial,
it
really
had
to
do
with
a
certain
contention
the
judge
turc
was
flirting
with
about
the
meaning
of
pring
as
to
whether
or
not
what
was
done
in
pring
constituted
some
basis--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--justice
stevens
i
agree
that
maybe
i
should
have
done
something
different,
but
i
thought
at
the
time
that
the
damages
we
were
seeking
to
recover
were
equally
recoverable
under
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
stress.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
this
is
a
virginia
tort.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
yes.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
that
case
which
i
saw
when
i
received
their
brief
i
believe
yesterday,
i
noticed
was
a
court
of
inferior
jurisdiction.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
controlling
on
this
court.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
good
law.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
understand
that
but
i
believe
that
there
are
other
cases
in
virginia,
which
have
been
cited
in
our
brief,
which
support
the
validity
of
the
preposition
that
we
are
asserting
that
virginia
recognizes
this
as
a
separate
and
independent
tort.
now,
that's
a
lower
court
case
and
it
may
be
appealed
or
it
may
not,
but
there
are
higher
authorities
within
the
state
of
virginia
which
support
the
position
that
we're
advancing
here.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
yes,
they
are,
justice
stevens.
now,
hustler
contends
that
the
actual
malice
test
of
libel
law
preempts
the
field
and
must
be
applied
universally
and
literally
to
all
dignitary
torts
involving
speech.
and
i
suggest
that
the
dunn
&
bradstreet
decision
and
the
hepps
decision
reject
that.
this
court
has
not
treated
that
as
a
universal
nostrum.
this
court
has
recognized
differences
in
speech
and
has
granted
less
first
amendment
protection,
and
sometimes
no
first
amendment
protection.
in
this
case,
subjective
awareness
of
falsity
or
reckless
disregard
of
truth
are
an
appropriate
way
of
examining
actual
malice
when
the
gravamen
of
the
tort
is
falsity
as
in
libel.
however,
here
with
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
which
has
also
been
described
as
outrageous
conduct,--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--i
believe
so.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no
one
pays
it?
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
in
this
case?
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
in
retrospect,
i
understand
what
you're
saying
about
that,
justice
marshall,
but
i
was
fighting
in
that
case,
the
suggestion
that
this
was
hyperbole
or
the
expression
of
an
opinion,
and
judge
turc
would
not
accept
the
view
that
the
accusation
of
incest
is
a
crime
which
constitutes
libel
per
se,
and
so
i
was
unable
to
try
the
case
in
that
posture.
as
i
was
pointing
out
to
the
court,
the
harm
done
to
the
individual
is
the
focus
of
this
tort.
it's
not
a
new
tort.
it's
been
in
existence
for
a
hundred
years.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no,
it
is
not
a
new
tort,
because
there
have
been
cases
that
have
been
decided
in
a
number
of
states
in
which
the
press
has
been
held
libel
for
this
tort,
not
only
for
the
intentional
infliction--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--well,
the
florida
case
that
i
speak
of
is
a
1984
case.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
to
that
extent,
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
for
this
court
a
tabula
rasa,
not
exactly,
however,
terra
incognita
because
in
this
connection,
you
are
guided
by
the
principles
that
the
court
has
developed
in
constitutional
interpretations
certainly
over
the
last
23
years
when
what
has
been
described
as
the
federalization
of
the
law
of
libel
first
began
in
a
commendable
context,
and
has
now
spread
to
the
point
where
i
believe
you
are
considering
either
dismantling
or
discarding
gertz.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
press,
the
press
that
clamors
here
for
a
universal
exemption
so
that
they
should
have
license
to
do
what
these
people
have
done,
and
that
it
should
be
condoned
and
considered
just
a
trivial
or
trifling
incident
of
being
a
public
figure.
in
mr.
justice
powell's
decision
in
gertz,
he
talked
about
protecting
speech
that
mattered.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
yes,
it
was.
but
in
the
opinion
that
mr.
justice
powell
wrote
for
the
court--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--i
apologize
to
the
other
members
of
the
court
whom
i
meant
no
slight,
but
it's
an
opinion
i'm
sure--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--in
my
view,
mr.
justice
white,
that
dissent
either
is
or
may
become,
or
should
become
the
law
of
the
land.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
because
well,
i
don't
know
any
place
else
to
suggest
that
it
ought
to
be.
but
i
do
think
that
what
experience
has
shown
us
has
been
the
unworkability
of
that
rule.
for
example,
in
time
v.
hill,
which
was
twenty
years
ago,
footnote
7,
justice
brennan
quoting
a
second
circuit
case,
i
think
it's
called
the
sidis
case,
said
speaking
about
even
true
revelations
may
be
so
intimate
and
so
unwarranted
in
view
of
the
victim's
position
as
to
outrage
the
community's
notion
of
decency.
so
this
is
a
problem
that
was
foreseen
more
than
twenty
years
ago,
and
now
the
problem
is
with
us.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
think
particularly
it
would
satisfy.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
all
these
questions
are
debatable.
that's
why
they
go
to
juries
for
determination.
but
i
think
it
is
highly
unrealistic
that
a
legislature
should
sit
down
and
write
a
deck
log
or
a
catalogue
of
prohibitions
to
constitute
guidelines
for
people
exercising
free
speech.
as
a
judge
said
in
another
case,
the
common
law
has
been
sufficient
not
to
muzzle
the
press,
and
the
common
law
is
already--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--this
is
a
common
law
tort.
downton
v.
wilkinson
was
a
common
law
tort.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no.
i
said
in
1984
when
i
started
to
quote
these
cases
to
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
there
was
a
florida
case
in
1984,
there
was
a
missouri
case
in
1982,
there
was
a
case
in
wisconsin
in
1970,
another
in
1982,
and
there
have
been
cases
in
new
hampshire,
ohio
and
the
district
of
columbia,
including
one
in
1929,
which
is
perry
v.
capital
traction
corporation,
in
which
this
court
denied
cert.--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--the
memory
of
man
runneth
contrary
perhaps
to
a
time
when
this
was
a
tort.
i
think
the
tort
originated
in
the
early
1900s.
it
originated
in
england.
it's
present
here.
it
has
been
a
subject
of
the
restatement
first.
and
a
subject
of
the
restatement
second.
perhaps
it's
something
that
becomes
more
prevalent
in
our
society
because
of
the
irresponsibility
of
certain
aberrant
publishers.
this
is
an
established
tort
under
the
law
of
virginia
and
under
most
of
the
states.
and
i
believe
as
a
constitutional
rule,
the
protection
of
the
individual's
interest
in
his
own
sense
of
worth
and
dignity
and
to
be
free
from
this
kind
of
gratuitous
onslaught
and
damage
to
his
feelings
is
something
that
ought
properly
to
be
left
to
the
states.
hustler
and
judge
wilkinson
argued
that
there
is
some
new
kind
of
category
that
this
court
ought
to
establish
called
the
political
public
figure.
that
is
a
figure
unknown
in
any
other
decision
and
certainly
not
in
this
court,
and
i
would
surely
argue
against
it.
because
this
court
has
said
that
by
becoming
a
public
figure,
a
person
does
not
abdicate
his
rights
as
a
human
being.
and
if
libel
will
not
protect
someone
who
is
subjected
to
this
utterly
not
dubious
but
worthless
kind
of
verbal
assault,
then
the
tort
of
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
which
virginia
recognizes
is
a
tort
which
deserves
support
and
endorsement
in
this
case
and
in
this
court.
this
case
is
no
threat
to
the
media.
it
will
be
the
rare
case
indeed
where
this
kind
of
behavior
will
ever
be
replicated,
but
where
it
occurs,
it
deserves
the
condemnation
which
the
jury
gave
it,
which
the
fourth
circuit
found,
and
which
i
respectfully
submit
this
court
should
affirm.
thank
you.
