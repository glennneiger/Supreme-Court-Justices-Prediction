justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
in
the
new
york
times
sense,
if
what
the
asserted
facts
here
were
known
to
be
untrue,
i
mean,
one
who
knew
nothing
about
mr.
falwell
or
anything
about
the
background
could
read
this
and
think
there
might
be
some
individual
that
this
was
a
factually
correct
statement
about.
so
that
these
are
statements
that
were
knowingly
false,
so
they
really
satisfied
the
new
york
times
standard
in
that
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
what
your
argument
is,
but
to
the
extent
that
there
are
factual
statements,
they
satisfy
the
new
york
times
standard
because
everybody
knows
they're
false,
including
the
speaker.
justice
john
paul
stevens
really,
all
i'm
suggesting
is
pretty
much
the
same
thing
justice
scalia
is.
i'm
not
sure
new
york
times
speaks
to
the
problem
we
have
before
us
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
isaacman,
you
puzzled
me
with
your
answer
to
justice
white,
and
assuming
there's
no
public
figure
involved,
and
you've
admitted
there's
a
public
interest
in
protecting
the
citizenry
from
emotional
distress,
what's
the
public
interest
in
protecting
speech
that
does
nothing
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
view
was
expressed
by
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
either
one,
other
than
something
that
just
upsets
the
target
of
the
comment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
the
public
interest
that
you're
describing,
you're
building
up
here
that
there's
some
interest
in
making
him
look
ludicrous
or
is
it
just
there's
public
interest
in
doing
something
that
people
might
think
is
funny?
what
is
the
public
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
answer
to
the
first
half
of
my
question.
what's
the
public
interest
in
the
case
involving
a
private
figure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
less?
what
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
different
argument.
yeah,
that
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
intent.
what
about
a
case
in
which
another
magazine
publisher
today
decided
i
think
i
could
sell
a
lot
of
magazines
by
reprinting
this
very
parody
here
because
it's
gotten
so
much
publicity
and
some
people
may
think
it's
funny
and
so
forth,
i
don't
care
if
it
hurts
mr.
falwell,
but
it
will
cause
precisely
the
same
harm
as
this
one.
is
there
recovery
in
that
case
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
free
game
now.
anybody
can
publish
this
other
than
mr.
flint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
what
you're
telling
me
under
your
test,
anybody
else
may
publish
it
without
incurring
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree
with
what
i
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
only
that,
but
the
purpose
in
the
jury
instruction
was
to
ask
that
question
as
a
predicate
to
the
second
question
which
related
to
malice
which
wouldn't
have
had
any
purpose
to
it
unless
it's
interpreted
the
way--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
your
second
question
all
goes
to
whether
the
new
york
times
malice
standard,
and
that
just
isn't
even
implicated
unless
it's
a
false
statement
of
fact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
different
question
that
just
troubles
me
a
little
bit
about
the
case.
your
tort
is
one,
i
gather,
that's
founded
on
virginia
law.
this
is
a
diversity
case,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
the
contours
of
this
tort
presumably
we
would
find
in
some
virginia
decisions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
latest
decision
that's
cited
in
your
opponent's
reply
brief
is
a
lower
court
decision
which
seems
to
say
there's
no
tort
of
this
kind
at
all.
you
didn't
comment
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it
correctly
describes
virginia
law,
it
is
controlling.
in
terms
of
what
the
virginia
law
is,
we
don't
decide
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
are
cited
in
your
brief?
