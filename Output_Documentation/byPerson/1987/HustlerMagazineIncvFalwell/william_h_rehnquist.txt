h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-1278,
hustler
magazine
and
larry
c.
flynt
versus
jerry
falwell.
mr.
isaacman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
would
be
a
change
in
our
constitutional
jurisprudence
to
protect
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
bose
is
a
one-way
street,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
all
matter
that
isn't
really
directly
involved
in
your
case.
i
mean,
you
have
a
favorable
determination
from
the
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
isaacman.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
grutman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
cartoonist
who
sits
down
at
his
easel,
or
whatever
cartoonists
sit
down
at,
and
thinks
to
himself,
a
candidate
acts
for
the
presidency
as
just
a
big
windbag,
a
pompous
turkey
and
i'm
going
to
draw
this
cartoon
showing
him
as
such.
you
know,
part
of
his
intent,
he
enjoys
cartooning
and
just
likes
to
make
people
look
less
than
they
are,
to
show
up
the
dark
side
of
people.
but
he
knows
perfectly
well
that's
going
to
create
emotional
distress
in
this
particular
person.
now,
does
that
meet
your
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
state
of
mind
required
from
the
defendant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
state
of
mind
i've
hypothesized
to
you.
does
that
satisfy
your
test
for
the
constitutional,
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
he
knows
it
will
inflict
emotional
distress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
grutman,
that's
not
the
way
the
fourth
circuit
interpreted
the
finding
in
this
case.
they
interpreted
it,
as
i
read
their
opinion,
the
majority,
to
mean
that
the
jury
understood
it
was
not
a
statement
of
factual
statement
about
him.
they
didn't
admit
that
they
thought
the
statement
was
false.
so
you're
urging
on
us,
a
meaning
that's
not
been
accepted
by
any
of
the
courts
that
have
had
the
case
so
far.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could,
but
you
didn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
certainly
a
new
tort
when
applied
to
the
press.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
how
recent
are
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i
said
was
it's
only
recently,
isn't
it,
that
the
courts
have
been
bringing
activities
of
the
press
within
this
expanding
tort
of
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
grutman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
third
of
this
long
series
of
cases
no.
86-1278,
hustler
magazine
et
al.
versus
falwell.
respondent
jerry
falwell,
a
nationally
known
minister
and
commentator
on
public
affairs
sued
petitioner
hustler
magazine
and
its
publisher
with
petitioner
larry
flynt
for
the
torts
of
liable
on
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
after
an
ad
parody
featuring
falwell's
name
and
picture
was
published
in
hustler
magazine.
this
ad
parody
also
contained
a
fictional
interview
with
falwell
and
which
he
allegedly
described
a
drunken
incestuous
encounter
with
his
mother
in
an
outhouse.
after
a
trial,
the
jury
held
for
hustler
on
a
liable
claims
specifically
finding
that
ad
parody
could
not
reasonably
be
understood
as
describing
actual
facts
about
falwell
or
actually
events
in
which
he
participated.
the
jury
found
for
falwell
on
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
claim,
however,
and
awarded
him
both
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
this
award
and
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
respondent
contends
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
prevent
a
public
figure
from
recovering
damages
for
speech
that
meets
the
requirement
of
a
state
law
tort
of
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
that
is
speech
that
would
intend
to
inflict
the
emotional
distress
was
outrages
and
did
in
fact
inflict
serious
emotional
distress.
we
think,
however,
that
in
the
context
of
public
debate
about
public
figures,
the
first
amendment
prohibits
the
finding
of
tort
liability
solely
on
the
basis
of
an
intent
to
injure
or
to
harm.
the
fact
that
the
speech
at
issue
is
outrages
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
to
subject
it
to
tort
liability.
for
if
you
went
ahead
on
this
basis
it
would
allow
jurors
to
impose
liability
on
the
basis
of
their
tastes
or
views
and
perhaps
on
the
basis
of
their
dislike
of
a
particular
expression.
we
conclude
that
in
order
for
a
public
figure
or
public
affair
shall
to
recover
for
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
you
need
to
show
additionally
that
the
publication
was
made
with
actual
malice
that
is
with
knowledge
that
it
was
false
with
reckless
disregard
of
whether
it
was
false
or
not.
here
it
is
clear
the
respondent
is
a
public
figure
and
therefore
he
may
not
recover
on
the
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
he
could.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part.
