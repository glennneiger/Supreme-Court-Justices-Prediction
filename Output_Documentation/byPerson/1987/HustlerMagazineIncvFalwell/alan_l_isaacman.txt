mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
amendment
protects
all
speech
except
for
certain
narrowly
drawn
categories.
for
example,
the
first
amendment
does
protect
false
statements
of
fact
made
with
requisite
fault.
the
first
amendment
doesn't
protect
obscene
speech.
the
first
amendment
doesn't
protect
fighting
words
made
in
the
presence
of
the
person
to
whom
the
words
are
addressed
and
likely
to
incite
violence.
this
cases
raises
as
a
general
question
the
question
of
whether
the
court
should
expand
the
areas
left
unprotected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
create
another
exception
to
protected
speech.
and
in
this
situation,
the
new
area
that
is
sought
to
be
protected
is
satiric
or
critical
commentary
of
a
public
figure
which
does
not
contain
any
assertions
of
fact.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
yes,
sir,
i
am.
i
am
suggesting
that.
in
a
specific
way,
the
question
becomes:
is
rhetorical
hyperbole,
satire,
parody,
or
opinion
protected
by
the
first
amendment
when
it
doesn't
contain
assertions
of
fact
and
when
the
subject
of
the
rhetorical
hyperbole
is
a
public
figure.
another
way
of
putting
this
case
is,
can
the
first
amendment
limitations
which
have
been
set
out
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
and
its
progeny
be
evaded
by
a
public
figure
who
instead
of
alleging
libel
or
instead
of
alleging
invasion
of
privacy,
seeks
recovery
for
an
allegedly
injurious
falsehood
by
labeling
his
cause
of
action
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
in
judging
the
publication
that's
at
issue
here,
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
context
in
which
it
appeared.
the
speaker
of
course
was
hustler
magazine,
and
hustler
magazine
is
known
by
its
readers
as
a
magazine
that
contains
sexually
explicit
pictures,
and
contains
irreverent
humor.
as
an
editorial
policy,
it
takes
on
the
sacred
cows
and
the
sanctimonious
in
our
society.
it
focuses
on
three
subject
areas
primarily.
it
focuses
on
sex,
it
focuses
on
politics
and
it
focuses
on
religion.
hustler
magazine
has
been
the
target
of
attacks
and
critical
commentary
by
jerry
falwell
for
years
and
for
years
prior
to
this
ad
publication.
hustler
magazine
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
political
spectrum
from
jerry
falwell.
on
the
other
hand,
jerry
falwell
filling
out
the
context
of
this
speech,
is
the
quintessential
public
figure.
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
person
in
this
country
who
doesn't
hold
political
office
who
can
has
more
publicity
associated
with
his
name
than
jerry
falwell.
jerry
falwell
is
the
head
of
the
moral
majority.
the
moral
majority,
he
testified
at
the
trial,
numbers
some
six
million
people.
it's
a
political
organization,
he
indicates.
it
was
set
up
to
advance
certain
political
views.
one
of
the
foremost
views
is
to
attack
what
he
considers
to
be
pornography,
and
to
attack
kings
of
porn,
in
his
words.
and
foremost
among
those
kings
of
porn
in
his
mind
is
larry
flynt.
he
includes
in
that
group
others
as
well,
such
as
bob
guccioni
of
penthouse
and
such
as
hugh
hefner
of
playboy.
the
moral
majority
and
jerry
falwell
also
attack
sexual
conduct
that
they
don't
consider
appropriate.
he
has
spoken
on
the
subject
of
extramarital
and
premarital
sex.
he
doesn't
approve
of
heterosexuals
living
together
outside
of
wedlock.
he
also
doesn't
approve
and
condemns
homosexuality.
now,
these
aren't
private
views
he
has
kept
to
himself
or
just
shared
with
his
family.
these
are
views
that
he's
gone
on
the
political
stump
and
tried
to
convince
other
people
about.
he
has
been
known
in
his
words,
as
he
testified,
by
the
good
housekeeping
magazine
which
did
a
survey
as
the
second-most
admired
man
in
the
united
states,
next
to
the
president.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
it
isn't
in
dispute
at
all.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
justice
o'connor,
it's
to
really
to
fill
out
the
political
context
and
the
fact
that
what
we
have
here
are
people
who
are
at
opposite
ends
of
the
political
spectrum,
engaging
in
the
uninhibited
robust
and
wide
open
debate
in
new
york
times
v.
sullivan.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
clearly,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
protecting
its
citizens
from
emotional
distress.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
i
would
submit
that
it
is
not
a
greater
interest
than
protecting
reputation,
because
in
the
area
of
reputational
injury,
libel
as
we
know
it,
for
example,
when
it's
in
written
form,
emotional
distress
is
an
element
of
recovery
as
well
as
damage
to
reputation,
and
reputation
affects
what
other
people
think
of
you.
it
affects
what
goes
on
in
the
minds
of
other
people
as
well,
and
not
just
the
minds
of
one
citizen.
so
reputation
in
a
sense
covers
a
lot
more
territory
than
emotional
distress
does.
and
the
point
of
what
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
we
really
have
people
who
are
engaging
in
political
debate
in
a
way
that
involves
vehement
caustic
and
sometimes
unpleasantly
sharp
language,
as
the
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
used.
now,
this
speech
is
protected
as
rhetorical
hyperbole,
it's
protected
as
satire
and
parody
and
as
the
expression
of
opinion.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
it
certainly
would
be
a
different
case.
we
think
that
even
in
that
situation,
this
court
should
find
that
these
allegations
could
in
no
way
be
perceived
as
factual
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
in
exercising
its
obligation
under
bose,
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
do
an
independent
review
of
the
record
to
determine
that
constitutional
fact,
that
is
to
say,
that
there
was
no
actual
malice
in
this
case
because
this
can't
be
perceived.
just
as
in
letter
carriers
v.
austin,
calling
the
plaintiffs
there
a
traitor
to
their
god,
their
country,
their
family,
saying
they
have
a
corkscrew
soul,
saying
that
instead
of
a
heart
they
have
tortured
principles,
was
considered
by
this
court
to
be
rhetorical
hyperbole,
and
not
to
be
taken
literally.
similarly,
there's
nothing
in
this
ad
parody
that
can
be
taken
as
a
statement
of
fact.
and
we're
in
an
unusual
situation
where
the
jury
has
made
that
determination
for
us.
so
we
now
know
that
even
this
jury,
which
should
never
have
been
allowed
to
consider
this.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
no,
we
don't
think
it
is.
we
don't
think
it
is
because--
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
--justice
o'connor,
i
suggest
that
in
the
first
amendment
context,
when
a
determination
is
made
by
a
jury
that's
adverse
to
speech,
and
when
a
jury
finds
that
the
speaker
made
statements
that
could
be
construed
as
statements
of
fact
and
were
knowingly
false,
then
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
take
that
review
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
speaker.
and
that's
what
the
first
amendment
says,
that
you
have
to
protect
the
speaker.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
your
honor,
i
do
think
it's
a
one-way
street.
bose
is
intended
to
protect
the
speaker,
it's
not
intended
to
protect
the
emotionally
distressed
interest
that
the
state
is
seeking
to
protect
in
the
area
of
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
stress
or
in
the
area
of
libel.
and
not
only
that,
but
we
have
a
situation
where
there
hasn't
been
an
appeal
from
the
determination
in
the
jury,
so
that's
res
judicata
yet.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
now,
going
on,
we
not
only
have
the
example
of
letter
carriers,
but
we
have
the
example
of
greenbelt
v.
bresler
where
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
was
accused
of
being
engaged
in
blackmail.
and
the
court
said
that
that
can't
be
taken
literally
because
that
was
just
intended
to
describe
his
negotiating
position,
and
that
is
hyperbole.
and
we
have
ample
lower
court
precedents
on
the
subject,
such
as
the
pring
case,
which
was
a
penthouse
article
about
a
miss
wyoming
which
attributed
certain
sexual
activities
on
her
part,
and
she
sued
for
libel,
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
stress,
and
other
causes
of
action.
and
the
tenth
circuit,
after
an
adverse
jury
determination
to
penthouse,
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
and
dismissed
that
case,
saying
that
that's
rhetorical
hyperbole.
that
article
couldn't
be
perceived
as
describing
actual
facts
about
the
plaintiff
in
that
case,
or
actual
events
in
which
she
participated.
same
finding
that
the
jury
made
in
this
case.
and
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
that
since
it's
rhetorical
hyperbole
and
protected
by
the
first
amendment
against
a
libel
claim,
it's
also
protected
against
an
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
claim
which
there
was
called
outrage
under
wyoming
law
because
the
same
constitutional
defenses
apply.
and
earlier
this
year
in
the
first
circuit
in
the
l.l.
bean
v.
drake
publishers,
the
court
there
said
that
parody
is
protected
speech,
and
even
though
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
complained
about
the
sexual
parody
that
occurred
of
l.l.
bean's
catalog,
that
was
protected
speech
and
the
case
was
found
in
favor
of
the
speaker
in
that
situation.
beyond
that,
jerry
falwell
as
a
public
figure
should
not
be
permitted
to
evade
the
first
amendment
limitations
that
have
been
set
forth
in
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
and
many
many
other
cases
with
respect
to
his
claim
for
an
allegedly
injurious
falsehood.
the
california
supreme
court
recently,
through
justice
mosc,
determined
in
blatty
v.
new
york
times,
that
where
the
gravamen
of
a
complaint
is
allegedly
injurious
falsehood,
it
doesn't
matter
what
you
call
your
claim,
because
the
first
amendment
covers
that
area.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
justice
scalia,
we
have
a
lot
of
cases
including
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
including
garrison
v.
louisiana,
and
say
it's
not
the
intent
to
cause
harm.
it's
not
the
hatred,
it's
not
the
ill
will,
it's
not
the
spite
that
the
first
amendment
is
directed
at.
it's
intent
to
cause
harm
through
knowing
falsehood
or
reckless
falsehood.
garrison
v.
louisiana
is
a
perfect
example.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
i
don't
think
that
any
reasonable
reader
of
any
of
the
speech
that
has
occurred
in
the
cases
including
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
garrison
and
all
the
other
cases
that
have
come
down,
letter
carriers
i
gave
as
an
example,
could
ever
say
that
the
speaker
did
not
intend
to
cause
harm.
when
you
say
something
that
somebody
has
a
corkscrew
soul
and
has
tortured
principles
for
a
heart
and
is
a
traitor,
who
can
believe
that
person
doesn't
intend
to
cause
harm.
people
intend
the
natural
consequences
of
their
actions.
and
they
intend
when
they
say
something
critical,
they
intend
that
that's
going
to
cause
some
harm
or
some
distress.
and
that
speech
has
to
be
protected,
or
all
we're
going
to
have
is
a
bland,
milquetoast
kind
of
speech
in
this
country.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
that's
correct.
knowing
falsity
may
be
enough.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
justice
stevens,
the
response
to
that
is
really
that
there
were
no
facts
asserted.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
if
you
change
what
this
article
means,
and
you
say
this
article's
capable
of
being
interpreted
as
an
assertion
of
fact,
then
you've
kind
of
set
the
stage
differently
from
what
it
is,
and
from
what
the
jury
determined.
if
you
say
that
in
letter
carriers,
that
the
person
who
made
that
comment
was
really
saying--
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
--it
speaks
in
a
sense
that
a
knowing
falsity,
a
reckless
falsity
is
required.
and
that
requires
that
there
be
a
false
statement
of
fact.
and
the
cases
indicate
that.
garrison
indicates
that.
letter
carriers
indicates
that.
before
there
can
be
a
false
statement
of
fact,
there
has
to
be
a
false
statement,
and
without
a
false
statement,
there
can
be
no
false
statement
of
fact.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
well,
that
brings
me
back
to
my
response,
justice
o'connor,
that
if
there
were
an
adverse
determination
to
the
speaker,
this
court
would
have
an
independent
obligation
to
examine.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
well,
the
only
thing
i
would
say
is
the
only
case
i
saw
that
dealt
with
that
is
brown
v.
knb
corporation,
a
connecticut
supreme
court
case
decided
august
18,
1987.
and
my
reading
of
that
case
is
that
the
independent
review
goes
one
way
and
it
goes
to
review
the
adverse
determination
against
the
speaker.
it
doesn't
go
to
review
a
finding
that
there
was--
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
well,
justice
white,
my
proposition
is--
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
--no,
no.
as
you
stated,
your
honor,
no,
it
isn't.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
because
what
that
leaves
out
is
opinion
or
parody
that
does
not
contain
anything
that
can
be
reasonably
understood
as
a
statement
of
fact.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
the
second
thing
that
your
hypothetical
left
out,
your
proposition
left
out
was
that
this
is
a
public
figure
who
is
bringing
this
action,
somebody
whose
supposed
to
have
a
thick
skin.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
and
even
though
it
contains
nothing
that
can
be
understood
as
a
false
statement
of
fact.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
including
that,
i
agree,
yes.
that's
my
proposition.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
you
cross
the
line
when
you
say
something
that
can
be
understood
as
a
false
statement
of
fact.
otherwise,
you're
not
going
to
have
the
uninhibited
robust--
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
--the
jury
said
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
perceived,
could
be
understood
as
a
fact.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
fortunately,
that's
not
my
case.
but
i
will
answer
that.
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
that
case
in
resolving
this
one.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
i
would
say
that
if
it
does
not
contain
a
false
statement
of
fact,
or
something
that
can
be
perceived
as
a
false
statement
of
fact,
then
even
it's
a
private
figure,
it's
protected
speech.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
common
law
in
the?
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
well,
this
tort
of
emotional
distress
is
really
such
a
new
tort
that
there
is,
to
my
knowledge,
not
a
lot
of
decisions
on
point.
and
in
virginia...
and
i
don't
mean
to
evade
your
question
and
i'll
try
to
answer
it...
but
in
virginia,
itself,
we
found
no
case
that
allows
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
cause
of
action
in
this
arena,
and
we
pointed
that
out
in
our
brief.
and
the
only
case
we
did
find
was
this
mitchell
v.
dameron
case,
that
indicated
that
you
cannot
sue
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
stress
when
you're
suing
on
what
is
considered
to
be
an
allegedly
injurious
falsehood
that
gives
rise
to
a
claimed
libel
action.
because
that
would
make
that
tort
duplicative
and
would
give
the
opportunity
for
plaintiff
to
get
around
the
first
amendment
limitations.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
there
is
a
public
interest
in
allowing
every
citizen
of
this
country
to
express
his
views.
that's
one
of
the
most
cherished
interests
that
we
have
as
a
nation.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
by
this
ad
parody,
or
your
example?
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
what
view
is
expressed
by
the
ad
parody
is
really
a
couple
fold
view,
two
views
or
more.
in
the
first
place,
we
have
to
understand
that
we're
talking
about
one
page
out
of
150
pages
in
the
magazine.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
so
it's
not
a
treatise
or
a
novel
that's
gone
into
a
long
development.
it
is
a
parody
of
a
compari
ad,
number
one,
if
it
does
that.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
and
that's
a
legitimate
view
for
it
to
express.
and
we
all
can
understand
how
it
parodied
the
ad.
it
is
also
a
satire
of
jerry
falwell,
and
he
is
in
many
respects
the
perfect
candidate
to
put
in
this
compari
ad
because
he's
such
a
ridiculous
figure
to
be
in
this
ad.
somebody
who
has
campaigned
against
alcohol,
campaigned
against
sex
and
that
kind
of
thing.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
there
are
two
public
interests.
with
respect
to
jerry
falwell
alone,
there
are
two
public
interests.
one
is
there
is
a
public
interest
in
having
hustler
express
its
view
that
what
jerry
falwell
says
as
the
rhetorical
question
at
the
end
of
the
ad
parody
indicates
is
b.s.
and
hustler
has
every
right
to
say
that
somebody
who's
out
there
campaigning
against
it
saying
don't
read
our
magazine
and
we're
poison
on
the
minds
of
america
and
don't
engage
in
sex
outside
of
wedlock
and
don't
drink
alcohol.
hustler
has
every
right
to
say
that
man
is
full
of
b.s.
and
that's
what
this
ad
parody
says.
and
the
first
part
of
the
ad
parody
does,
it
puts
him
in
a
ridiculous
setting.
instead
of
jerry
falwell
speaking
from
the
television
with
a
beatific
look
on
his
face
and
the
warmth
that
comes
out
of
him,
and
the
sincerity
in
his
voice,
and
he's
a
terrific
communicator,
and
he's
standing
on
a
pulpit,
and
he
may
have
a
bible
in
his
hand,
instead
of
that
situation,
hustler
is
saying,
let's
deflate
this
stuffed
shirt,
let's
bring
him
down
to
our
level,
or
at
least
to
the
level
where
you
will
listen
to
what
we
have
to
say.
[laughter]
i
was
told
not
to
joke
in
the
supreme
court.
i
really
didn't
mean
to
do
that.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
in
the
case
of
a
private
figure,
the
public
interest
is
admittedly
less.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
there
is
still
interest
in
expressing
your
views,
there's
still
an
interest
in
people
being
able
to
express
their
views,
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
public
may
not
have
any
great
interest
in
hearing
those
views.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
well,
one
of
the
lines
was
suggested
by
a
question
earlier,
and
that
is
in
the
private
figure
of
public
figure
area,
if
the
court
really
wants
to
balance.
but
somebody
whose
going
into
public
life,
george
washington
as
an
example,
there's
a
cartoon
in
i
think
it's
the
cartoonist's
society
brief,
that
has
george
washington
being
led
on
a
donkey
and
underneath
there's
a
caption
that,
so
and
so
whose
leading
the
donkey
is
leading
this
ass,
or
something
to
that
effect.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
there's
no
line
in
terms
of
the
meaning
because
hustler
wasn't
saying
that
he
was
committing
incest
with
his
mother.
nobody
could
understand
it
to
be
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
what
you're
talking
about,
justice
scalia,
is
a
matter
of
taste.
and
as
justice
scalia,
you
said
in
pope
v.
illinois,
just
as
it's
useless
to
argue
about
taste,
it's
useless
to
litigate
it,
litigate
about
it.
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
is,
well,
is
this
tasteful
or
not
tasteful.
that's
really
what
you're
talking
about
because
nobody
believed
that
jerry
falwell
was
being
accused
of
committing
incest.
the
question
is
is
this
in
good
taste
to
put
him
in
this,
draw
this
image,
paint
a
picture.
if
you
charge
a
man
with
a
crime,
your
honor,
and
it's
an
assertion
that
he
committed
a
crime,--
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
--no.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
if
it's
a
knowing
false
statement
of
fact,
if
you're
charging
him
with
a
crime
and
it's
perceived
that
you're
charging
him
with
a
crime,
and
you're
doing
it
with
knowledge
that
that's
false,
it's
not
okay
against
a
public
figure.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
no,
it
isn't
this
case.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
justice
marshall,
they
did
not
charge
him
with
incest,
and
a
jury
determined--
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
--they
had
him
and
his
mother
together
to
what's
called
in
literary
forum,
travesty,
to
put
somebody
in
a
ridiculous
unbelievable
setting
for
purposes
of
effect.
they
put
him
in
this
situation
knowing
nobody
would
really
perceive
that
that's
what
he's
actually
doing.
but
to
say
we're
going
to
deflate
this
man
who
is
so
self-righteous
in
the
area
of
sex
and
telling
everybody
else
what
to
do,
as
well
as
telling
them
what
to
read.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
it
serves
the
same
public
purpose
in
a
sense
of
having
trudeau
in
doonesbury
call
george
bush
a
wimp.
what
public
purpose
does
that
have?
it
makes
people
look
at
that
and
maybe
think
of
george
bush
a
little
bit
differently.
and
somebody
who
is
out
there
telling
other
people
how
to
live
and
being
very
serious
and
sober
about
it
and
acting
as
though
he
has
more
knowledge
than
they
do
about
how
they
live
their
lives,
hustler
has
a
right
to
make
comments
about
it
and
make
him
look
ridiculous
as
long
as
they
don't
state
false
statements
of
fact
knowingly
or
recklessly.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
it
was
not
a
statement
of
fact,
your
honor,
and
the
jury
so
found.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
what
was
it?
it
was
hyperbole.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
just
as
calling
somebody
a
blackmailer
was
not
saying
he's
a
blackmailer.
it
was
saying
that
he
was
engaged
in--
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
--that's
correct.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
that's
correct.
but
in
greenbelt,
saying
that
somebody
was
a
blackmailer--
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
--no,
it
is
not
right,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
they
would
have
to
say
it
in
a
way
that
a
reasonable
reader
would
perceive
that
that's
what
hustler
was
saying,
that
he
is
guilty
of
incest.
and
this
jury
that
was
certainly
not
a
jury
that
came
from
hustler's
background
in
any
way,
said
that
no
reasonable
reader
could
perceive
this
as
a
statement
of
fact.
and
in
summing
up,
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
say
this
is
not
just
a
dispute
between
hustler
and
jerry
falwell,
and
a
rule
that's
applied
in
this
case
is
not
just
that
hustler
magazine
can
no
longer
perform
what
it
does
for
its
readers,
and
that
is
produce
this
type
of
irreverent
humor
or
other
types
of
irreverent
humor.
it
affects
everything
that
goes
on
in
our
national
life.
and
we
have
a
long
tradition,
as
judge
wilkinson
said,
of
satiric
commentary
and
you
can't
pick
up
a
newspaper
in
this
country
without
seeing
cartoons
or
editorials
that
have
critical
comments
about
people.
and
if
jerry
falwell
can
sue
because
he
suffered
emotional
distress,
anybody
else
whose
in
public
life
should
be
able
to
sue
because
they
suffered
emotional
distress.
and
the
standard
that
was
used
in
this
case,
does
it
offend
generally
accepted
standards
of
decency
and
morality
is
no
standard
at
all.
all
it
does
is
allow
the
punishment
of
unpopular
speech.
mr.
alan
l.
isaacman
every
time
almost
every
time
that
something
critical
is
said
about
somebody,
because
how
can
any
speaker
come
in
and
say
i
didn't
intend
to
cause
any
emotional
distress,
and
be
believed.
if
you
say
something
critical
about
another
person,
and
if
it's
very
critical,
it's
going
to
cause
emotional
distress.
we
all
know
that.
that's
just
common
sense.
so
it's
going
to
be
an
easy
thing
to
show,
intend
to
harm.
that's
why
that's
a
meaningless
standard.
incidentally,
it
was
a
negligence
standard
in
this
case.
