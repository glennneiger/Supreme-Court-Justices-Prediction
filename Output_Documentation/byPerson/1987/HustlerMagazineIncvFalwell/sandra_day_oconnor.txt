justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
isaacman,
is
the
fact
that
you
claim
mr.
falwell
is
a
public
figure
in
dispute
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
i
guess
we
could
move
on
to
the
arguments,
because
apparently
your
remarks
are
for
the
purpose
of
demonstrating
he's
a
public
figure.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
state
have
an
interest
in
protecting
its
citizens
from
emotional
distress,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
perhaps
that's
an
even
greater
interest
than
protecting
reputation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
this
be
a
different
case
if
the
jury
had
found
that
the
allegations
could
be
considered
factual?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
finding
by
the
jury
has
opened
for
this
court
to
consider
again
de
novo?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
that
in
the
first
amendment
context,
we'd
have
to
consider
those
issues
again.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
gets
us
back
to
bose
and
whether
we
have
to
reexamine
this
statement
for
ourselves
to
determine
whether
it's
a
factual
statement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
think
bose
spelled
it
out
that
way.
i
don't
read
that
necessarily
into
bose.
so
you
may
be
asking
us
to
move
on
to
another
step
beyond
that
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
that
connecticut
case
isn't
binding
on
us.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
common
law,
i
suppose
the
exception
was
just
for
fair
comment,
wasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
this
tort
of
emotional
distress,
that
there
was
leeway
for
some
kind
of
fair
comment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
grutman,
i
guess
there
are
those
who
think
that
the
conduct
of
certain
newspapers
in
pursuing
mr.
hart
recently
was
of
the
same
unwarranted
character.
should
that
result
in
some
kind
of
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
would
limit
the
recovery
for
the
tort
of
emotional
distress
to
recovery
for
a
falsehood?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
if
the
jury
were
to
determine
that
what
the
newspapers
did
with
regard
to
mr.
hart
fell
in
that
category?
is
that
recoverable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
would
say
it's
open
to
a
jury
determination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
a
vicious
cartoon
should
subject
the
drawer
of
that
cartoon
to
potential
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
would
subject,
thought,
the
range
of
political
cartoonists,
for
example,
to
that
kind
of
jury
inquiry,
whether
it
was
vicious
enough
to
warrant
recovery.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
grutman,
in
today's
world,
people
don't
want
to
have
to
take
these
things
to
a
jury.
they
want
to
have
some
kind
of
a
rule
to
follow
so
that
when
they
utter
it
or
write
it
or
draw
it
in
the
first
place,
they're
comfortable
in
the
knowledge
that
it
isn't
going
to
subject
them
to
a
suit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
grutman,
there's
plenty
of
malice
here
all
right.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
that's
your
problem.
but
the
jury
said
this
can't
be
reasonable
viewed
as
making
a
factual
allegation.
