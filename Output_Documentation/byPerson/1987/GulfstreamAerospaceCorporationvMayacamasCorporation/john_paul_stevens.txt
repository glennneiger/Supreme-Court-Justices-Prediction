justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
result
of
the
trial.
the
$900,000
award
to
your
opponent,
is
that
a
net
award
or
a
credit
against
what
you
claimed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
net
award.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
that's
what
i
thought
but
i
wanted
to
be
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by.
do
you
agree
that
you
could
have
removed
the
georgia
case
to
the
federal
court
in
georgia
and
still
preserve
your
objection
to
personal
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
removal
statute
seems
to
assume
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction
of
the
case
in
the
federal
court.
i'm
just
puzzled
by
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
it's
sort
of
a
trying
to
predict
what'll
happen
in
this
case.
does
georgia
also
have
a
statute
expediting
the
review
of
cases
that
are
pending
in
another
forum?
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
have
much
chance
of
winning
the
race
no
matter
what
we
do
here.
they've
already
tried
that
case
gone
to
judgment
and
presumably
they
like
to
help
their
courts
decide
things
before
other
courts
can
decide
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you're
back
on
square
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
your
motions
in
the
trial
court
are
not
successful,
that
may
well
be
where
the
case
will
be
decided,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
it's
clear.
is
that
based
on
some
decision
or
do
you
just
think
it's
clear
on
those
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
it
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
