justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
haven't
reached
the
appellate
stage
yet?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
surely
you
will
appeal?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
will
not
appeal?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
they
could
have
removed
it
of
course?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
have
just
said
that
they
could
have
removed
it
to
federal
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
that
step
had
been
taken,
could
the
case
have
been
transferred
to
the
northern
district
of
california...
is
that
where
it
was?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
bien,
i
may
have
missed
something
here
but
is
jurisdiction
over
your
opposition
still
contested,
jurisdiction
of
the
georgia
court
over
your
opposition
still
contested?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
kind
of
an
appearance
have
they
made?
a
special
appearance
all
the
way
through
the
litigation
there
in
georgia?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
that
issue
is
undecided
in
the
georgia
litigation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
isn't
that
an
important
issue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
makes
a
distinct
difference
in
the
state
litigation
in
georgia
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
federal
litigation
in
california
on
the
other.
