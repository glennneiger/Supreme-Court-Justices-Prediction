chief
justice

h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
86-1329,
gulfstream
aerospace
corporation
versus
mayacamas
corporation.
mr.
bien,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bien,
as
a
practical
matter,
what
were
the
consequences
to
your
client
of
the
district
court's
denial
of
your
stay
motion?
were
discovery
proceedings
started
in
california
or
other
things
done
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
you
said
that
they
insisted
on
proceeding
with
it.
the
district
court
denied
a
stay
and
that
could
have
a
number
of
different
interpretations.
i
mean,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
they
were
just
hell-bent
to
race
for
trial
with
the
georgia
state
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
district
court
here
had
said,
mr.
bien,
i'm
going
to
deny
your
motion
to
dismiss
but
i'm
going
to
stay
all
proceedings
in
this
case
for
six
months,
and
then
you
people
come
back
and
tell
me
how
the
georgia
litigation
is
coming.
do
you
think
that
would
be
appealable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
then
that
the
northern
district
of
california
actually
did
not
have
jurisdiction
of
this
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
just
a
question
whether
the
court
should
have
proceeded
with
the
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bien.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
ward.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
alternative,
which
i
presume
you
subscribe
to,
is
that
what
both
lawsuits
go
ahead
full
steam
as
your
opponent
says,
duplicating
the
legal
resources
until
one
finally
goes
to
judgment?
that
doesn't
seem
an
entirely
happy
solution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
there
an
objection
on
your
part
when
the
georgia
state
court
action
finally
went
to
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
what
ground?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
didn't
argue
that
there
was
another
case
pending
in
the
northern
district
of
california
that
should
prevent
it
from
going
to
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they've
anticipated
all
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
principal
question
we're
interested
in
considering
i
guess
is
not
so
much
who
should
have
won
in
the
district
court,
but
whether
the
district
court's
order
denying
a
stay
was
appealable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ward.
mr.
bien,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bien.
the
case
is
submitted.
