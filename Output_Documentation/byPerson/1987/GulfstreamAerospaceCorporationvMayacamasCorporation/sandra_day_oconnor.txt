justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bien,
as
i
understand
it,
the
georgia
suit
went
to
trial
and
there's
a
judgment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
have
you
filed
any
motion
in
the
federal
district
court
now
to
dismiss
the
suit
on
res
judicata
grounds
or
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
further
motions
have
been
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
as
a
result
of
what's
transpired?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
we
thought
that
the
action
could
have
been
filed
in
the
california
district
court,
i
guess
you
could
have
filed
a
motion
there
to
change
venue
back
to
the
georgia
district
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
ever
file
such
a
motion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
wanted
to
get
into
the
federal
court
and
if
you
also
wanted
to
have
just
one
suit
going,
why
wouldn't
you
have
asked
for
removal
to
the
federal
district
court
in
georgia,
and
then
moved
for
a
transfer
change
of
venue
to
california,
if
you
felt
the
circumstances
warranted
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
wouldn't
have
been
transferred.
