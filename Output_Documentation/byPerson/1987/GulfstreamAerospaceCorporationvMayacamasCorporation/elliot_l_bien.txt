mr.
elliot
l.
bien
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
open
this
afternoon
with
a
very
brief
statement
of
the
case
and
next
comment
on
the
nature
of
the
issue
as
it
was
faced
by
the
district
court,
and
then
turn
to
the
matter
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
as
set
forth
in
the
briefs,
while
appellate
jurisdiction
does
not
stand
or
fall
on
the
merits
of
any
particular
rule,
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
presence
of
appellate
jurisdiction
does
turn
on
both
the
nature
and
the
importance
of
the
ruling,
and
on
the
practicalities
of
delaying
appellate
review.
now,
the
underlying
facts
and
legal
issues
of
this
case
are
completely
unremarkable
from
a
federal
point
of
view.
what
is
remarkable
from
that
standpoint
is
the
notion
that
a
federal
court
should
undertake
to
adjudicate
this
type
of
dispute
when
a
competent
state
court
was
already
doing
so
on
the
exact
same
issues,
exact
same
parties,
and
when
removal
had
been
available
to
the
state
court
defendant
but
had
been
foregone.
after
summarizing
the
case,
i
will
argue
that
the
federal
suit
that
resulted
was
not
only
identical
and
duplicative
of
the
state
court
lawsuit,
but
because
removal
had
been
available
the
duplicative
federal
suit
was
wholly
unnecessary
even
from
the
federal
plaintiff's
point
of
view.
and
wholly
without
justification
under
this
court's
decisions
or
under
the
intention
of
congress
since
1789
when
congress
created
the
removal
process.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
i
will
be
addressing
that.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
no.
the
georgia
case,
as
i
reported
in
our
reply
brief,
went
to
a
jury
trial
in
early
november
and
a
verdict
for
mayacamas,
the
respondent,
was
entered
and
judgment
ensued.
i'm
advised
by
counsel
for
the
respondent
that
today
or
friday,
mayacamas
has
filed
papers
in
the
trial
court
in
georgia
seeking
a
new
trial,
and
because
of
the
outcome,
we
certainly
expect
on
gulfstream's
part
that
whatever
the
outcome
of
the
new
trial
proceedings
in
georgia,
it
will
be
followed
by
an
appeal
by
mayacamas
as
well.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
no.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
i
can
state
on
gulfstream's
behalf
that
we
will
not
appeal.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
we
will
not
appeal.
we
may
cross
appeal
if
mayacamas
appeals,
but
we
will
not
appeal.
so
in
answering
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that--
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
--not
as
of
yet.
not
as
of
yet.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
if
mayacamas
does
not
take
an
appeal
and
if
a
federal
trial
judge,
district
judge
finds
res
judicata
to
be
applicable,
and
if
there's
a
dispute
that
is
resolved
in
favor
of
res
judicata
on
appeal,
then
i
think
technical
mootness
would
apply.
however,
i
would
still
argue,
as
i
would
argue
now,
but
i
think
there's
more
strength--
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
--well,
we
don't
reach
the
res
judicata
issue
here.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
well,
assuming
that
a
final
decision
in
one
forum
or
the
other,
let's
say
in
a
state
forum,
was
reached
and
there
was
finality,
then
we
would
certainly
argue
that--
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
--i
think
the
judgment
would
have
to
be
afforded
full
faith
and
credit
in
the
federal
court,
and
that
would
effectively
end
the
dispute.
unless
there
were
some
reason
why
a
res
judicata
would
not
follow
but
i
can't
envision
any
such
reason
at
this
point.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
well,
again,
i
don't
believe
that
the
reason
to
avoid
duplicative
litigation
is
that
the
prospect
of
a
res
judicata
now
here
in
the
federal
court,
but
in
either
court,
creates
the
kind
of
tension
and
pressure
on
both
courts
that's
undesirable.
so
i
don't
know
if
i'm
quibbling
with
you,
but
i'm
saying
that
we
don't
argue
the,
and
in
this
particular
case,
we
haven't
argued
it
in
the
briefs
and
i'm
not
arguing
it
this
morning
what
the
specific
res
judicata
effect
would
be.
i
assume,
without
arguing,
that
there
would
be
a
res
judicata
effect
eventually.
but
i
do
want
to
address
the
mootness
problem
in
one
more
step
and
i
think
that
even
if
the
res
judicata
did
arise
as
a
result
of
the
verdict
that
was
reached
in
georgia,
i
think
you
have
a
classic
situation
where
the
issues
now
before
this
court
would
be
capable
of
repetition
even
as
addressed
to
gulfstream
which
is
a
party
which
is
a
large
corporation
may
face
that
situation.
and
the
issue
always
arises
at
the
beginning
of
the
lawsuit.
and
i
think
it's
a
classical
case
where
it
could
evade
review
if
even
a
technical
mootness
would
have
the
result
of--
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
--not
these
particular
parties.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
well,
i
believe
that
under
the
roe
v.
wade
in
the
pregnancy
situation
and
some
others,
that
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
affect
the
particular
party.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
i
believe
the
blumstein
case,
the
dunn
v.
blumstein,
where
the
challenge
to
election
rules
where
even
if
the
particular
plaintiff
that
brought
the
case
may
not
have
been
in
a
position
to
vote
in
a
state
with
a
challenged
election
procedure
that
there
might
have
been
other
voters
who
are
facing
the
exact
same
situation
which
if
it
was
not
adjudicated
by
this
court
might
once
again
have
the
issue
evade
with
you.
but
i
don't
believe
we'll
have
to
get
that
far.
i
just
did
want
to
complete
my
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
no.
this
is
as
i
understand
it
a
net
award.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
we
would
have
to
pay
them
$900,000.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
right.
just
very
briefly
in
terms
of
the
facts
of
the
underlying
case,
run
through
this
quickly.
it's
a
garden
variety
commercial
dispute,
not
a
single
federal
law
is
involved
as
to
the
decision
on
the
merits.
gulfstream
makes
fine
aircraft
down
in
savannah,
georgia.
in
june
of
1983,
mayacamas,
a
california
corporation,
agreed
to
buy
one
of
these
planes
for
about
$13
million.
the
next
progress
payment
was
due
about
two
years
later
by
the
end
of
august
of
1985.
two
weeks
before
the
deadline,
mayacamas
claimed
that
gulfstream
had
breached
the
contract
and
violated
representations
made
about
the
production
schedule
so
that
the
value
of
mayacamas'
purchase
had
been
diminished.
as
the
deadline
for
the
second
payment,
which
was
equal
to
the
original
payment,
passed,
there
were
mutual
threats
of
each
side
being
in
breach
of
the
contract,
threats
of
litigation
on
both
sides.
and
about
a
month
and
a
half
later,
gulfstream
elected
to
file
a
lawsuit
for
breach
of
contract
in
a
state
court
in
georgia.
this
came
on
october
9,
1985.
now,
its
undisputed
in
this
case
that
mayacamas
being
a
corporate
citizen
of
the
state
of
california,
could
have
removed
gulfstream's
state
court
action
to
the
federal
court
in
the
state
of
georgia,
but
did
not
do
so.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
why
is
that?
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
that's
correct.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
mayacamas,
if
it
felt
that
california
was
a
more
convenient
forum,
certainly
had
a
motion
under
title
28
section
1404
for
a
transfer
for
the
convenience
of
parties
and
in
the
interests
of
justice.
and
i
might
point
out
that
there
is
a
concession
in
its
brief
on
the
merits
here
that
georgia
may
not
have
been
inconvenient
enough
a
forum
to
have
prevailed
on
such
a
motion.
that
statement
is
made
in
the
answering
brief.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
certainly.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
no.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
our
position
was
that
the
case
shouldn't
even
proceed
in
california.
well,
in
that
mayacamas
did
not
exercise
their
removal
right
but
filed
an
independent
lawsuit
in
the
district
court
in
northern
california.
gulfstream
moved
under
the
colorado
river
doctrine
for
a
stay
or
dismissal
of
that
lawsuit.
the
motion
was
in
the
end
of
november,
1985.
the
order
of
denial
was
issued
about
a
month
and
a
half
later
on
february
21,
1986.
the
district
court
said
that
as
it
viewed
the
colorado
river
doctrine,
notwithstanding
the
logic
of
gulfstream's
position
about
duplicative
litigation,
the
district
court
stated
in
its
written
order
that
this
court
must
exercise
its
jurisdiction.
gulfstream
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit.
opinion
emerged
some
ten
months
later.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
there
were
discovery
proceedings,
as
i
understand
it,
going
forward
in
both
forums.
so
you
had
a
typical
parallel
proceeding
in
both
courts
where
all
the
potential
for
conflicting
discovery
rulings
were
taking
place.
certainly
gulfstream
had
to
incur
the
cost
of
two
sets
of
attorneys
and
proceeding
in
the
two
different
courts.
so
those
impacts
were
certainly
taking
place.
our
primary
argument
on
the
practical
impact
is
that
when
the
district
court
insisted
on
proceeding
with
this
duplicative
lawsuit,
that
it
was
creating
a
practical
impact
on
federalism
concerns.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
i
think
that
at
the
threshold
that
the
ruling
in
question
on
our
motion
citing
the
availability
of
removal
and
arguing
under
colorado
river
that
the
district
court
shouldn't
proceed
at
all,
i
think
that
was...
and
i'm
anticipating
the
problem
of
appealability
here...
i
think
that
was
a
conclusive
type
of
ruling.
there
are
other
kinds
of
circumstances
that
might
have
taken
place
down
the
road,
the
district
court
perhaps
considering
purely
prudential
matters,
looking
at
the
practicalities
of
one
suit
or
another,
may
possibly
have
ordered
a
stay,
a
temporary
stay
or
a
permanent
stay
later
on.
but
i
think
the
particular
ruling
that
it
made
came
up
squarely
and
appropriately
at
the
threshold
that
the
suit
had
no
business
being
allowed
to
proceed
at
all,
given
the
duplicative
lawsuit
in
the
state
court.
and
that
ruling,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
chance
that
there
would
have
been
a
reconsideration
or
reevaluation
of
that
legal
ruling
based
upon
any
future
circumstances.
i
think
that
in
effect...
i
don't
know
that
it
would
have
been
a
colorado
river
motion
say
a
year
and
a
half
later...
but
perhaps
it
would
have
been
purely
a...
i
guess
it
would
have
been
a
discretionary
colorado
river
motion,
after
the
court
had
said
that,
well
the
removal
factor
does
not
bring
this
case
out
of
the
ordinary
realm
of
discretionary
stays.
and
a
year
and
a
half
later,
it
might
have
said,
well,
now
the
georgia
case
has
proceeded
faster
or
whatever,
maybe
it
would
have
stayed
it,
but
i
think
that
would
have
been
a
fundamentally
different
kind
of
ruling
down
the
road.
and
that
is
where
i
think
the
moses
cone
hospital
analysis
does
not
govern
our
particular
case
as
far
as
appealability
is
concerned.
perhaps
i
should
turn
to
that.
in
moses
cone
hospital,
you
had
a
court
granting
a
colorado
river
type
motion,
and
the
question
was
at
the
threshold
was
is
that
appealable.
and
the
court
ruled
that
it
was
appealable
for
two
different
reasons.
one
was
the
rationale
under
the
idlewild
case
that
the
plaintiff
had
been
put
effectively
out
of
court.
but
then
the
court
reached
a
second
ground
for
appealability,
and
that
is
the
doctrine
that
i
primarily
rely
on
here.
and
that
is
the
cohen
collateral
order
doctrine
where
the
three
or
perhaps
four
categories
of
a
narrow
class
of
preliminary
orders,
of
interlocutory
orders
are
deemed
appealable.
and
we
certainly
i
think
have
all
four
here.
we
have
an
important
issue,
indeed
i
would
say
we
have
an
historically
important
issue,
given
the
origins
and
the
purpose
of
the
removal
jurisdiction.
we
have
an
order
that
moses
cone
hospital,
itself,
held
squarely
was
separate
from
the
merits.
i
think
when
you
flip
and
say
that
we
have
an
order
denying
a
stay,
i
think
it's
still
equally
separate
from
the
merits.
we
have
an
order
which
is
not
effectively
reviewable
if
you
wait
until
the
end
of
the
lawsuit.
all
the
conflicts
and
tensions
between
the
state
and
federal
courts
are
moving
along
as
the
case
proceeds
to
the
final
judgment.
and
to
reverse
the
judgment
at
the
end
i
think
provides
no
effective
recourse
at
all
for
this
particular
problem.
and
finally,
as
i
was
stating
in
response
to
the
chief
justice
a
little
bit
earlier,
you
have
a
ruling
which,
under
the
analysis
of
the
moses
cone
hospital,
i
think
is
clearly
conclusive
in
that
it's
a
determined,
it's
a
considered
judgment
on
the
significance
of
the
removal
factor
in
the
context
of
identical
duplicative
lawsuits,
and
i
believe
that
it's
conclusive
for
two
kinds
of
reasons,
both
found
in
moses
cone
hospital.
one
is
if
you
look
at
the
decision
of
the
district
judge,
it's
a
memorandum
opinion.
the
judge
considered
the
colorado
river
issue,
and
said
the
court
must
exercise
its
jurisdiction
on
those
grounds.
and
i
believe
it
fits
moses
cone
hospital
quite
clearly.
and
we
also
argue
in
our
briefs
if
you
look
back
at
the
two
companion
cases
in
1963,
one
was
the
curry
case
involving
national
labor
relations
proceeding,
and
the
one
that
followed
it
involving
a
national
bank.
you
had
a
trial
judge,
just
as
here,
making
a
decision
at
the
threshold
simply
to
proceed
with
the
lawsuit.
and
the
defense,
similar
to
our
defense
here,
was
that
the
very
fact
that
you're
proceeding
with
the
lawsuit
is
inimicable
to
a
very
important
federal
policy.
in
the
one
case,
the
policy
to
have
a
labor
dispute
adjudicated
by
the
labor
board,
and
in
the
second
case,
in
the
langdo
case,
the
policy
was
not
to
have
a
national
bank
sued
in
a
venue
not
its
home
venue.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
i
believe
so.
because
i
think
when
you
have
the
removal
factor...
and
this
certainly
is
our
primary
argument...
there
is
a
preliminary
legal
determination
there
that
has
been
made,
even
if
the
court
might
act
differently
six
months
from
now.
the
preliminary
determination
has
been
made
similar
to
curry
and
langdo
that
this
case
belongs
here
notwithstanding
the
availability
of
a
removal
action.
that
situation
can
never
change.
it's
presented
fully
at
the
threshold
and
its
ruled
on.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
no,
no.
we
concede
that
there
is
diversity
jurisdiction,
concede
that
there's
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
that's
correct.
that's
similar
to
colorado
river
in
1976.
in
fact,
it's
very
similar
to
iowa
mutual
v.
laplante,
which
was
decided
in
february
of
this
year
where
an
insurance
company
in
an
insurance
coverage
dispute
with
some
people
on
an
indian
tribe
came
to
the
federal
district
court
asserting
diversity
jurisdiction
over
a
coverage
dispute
which
was
in
excess
of
$10,000.
the
same
dispute
looking
on
the
mirror
image
side
of
it
had
already
been
before
a
tribal
court
of
the
black
feet
indians,
so
a
colorado
river
motion
was
made
and
granted.
and
the
reason
was,
conceding
the
presence
of
diversity
jurisdiction
as
certainly
we
do,
that
the
important
federal
policy
of
i
think
the
way
it
was
framed
was
of
maintaining
the
ability
of
the
indians
to
have
their
self-government
and
respecting
that
self-government,
called
for
a
stay
and
a
deferral
to
the
indian
court
system.
and
i
think
the
analogy
is
quite
close
here.
we
concede
jurisdiction,
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
i
think
what
takes
this
case
even
beyond
iowa
mutual
and
beyond
colorado
river
and
all
five
cases
that
have
come
up
under
the
colorado
river
doctrine
since
1976,
is
that
the
insurance
company
in
iowa
mutual
had
invoked
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
only
way
it
could.
there's
no
removal
from
the
black
feet
indian
court
system.
there
was
no
prior
pending
action
in
colorado
river
or
in
the
san
carlos
apache
case
where
somebody
could
have
removed.
these
plaintiffs
had
come
to
federal
court
in
the
only
way
they
could
and
if
the
federal
court
didn't
exercise
its
jurisdiction
there,
the
federal
plaintiff
would
have
had
no
federal
adjudication.
in
our
case,
mayacamas
could
have
had
a
federal
forum
under
the
diversity
jurisdiction
by
removal.
it
had
an
absolute
right
to
that
forum.
it
simply
had
to
file
a
petition
for
removal
within
30
days.
it
would
have
had
its
diversity
adjudication.
then
it
could
have
moved
for
a
transfer
and
so
forth.
the
reason
why
this
court
has
allowed
a
duplication
of
efforts
when
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
as
the
reason
was
explained
in
the
colorado
river
case,
was
that
congress
had
created
the
jurisdiction
for
a
reason
and
that
there's
a
presumptive...
i
think
the
court
said...
virtually
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction.
here
that
jurisdiction
could
have
been
exercised,
and
in
way
that
i
think
congress
intended
since
1789
as
a
preferable
method
of
exercising
diversity
jurisdiction
in
this
type
of
case.
as
we
set
forth
in
our
briefs,
i
think
the
framers
in
the
debates
made
quite
clear
that
they
were
concerned
about
federal
diversity
actions
duplicating
state
court
proceedings
on
the
exact
same
issue
and
the
same
parties.
and
each
of
the
language
of
that
debates
is
very
reminiscent
of
this
court's
language
in
such
cases
as
san
carlos
apache,
where
it
talks
about
an
unseemly
race
to
decide
the
same
issues
first
creating
concurrent
conflicts
and
tensions
between
the
federal
and
state
courts.
and
i
think
justice
frankfurter
used
very
similar
language
in
the
brillhart
case
talking
about
an
exercise
of
declaratory
judgment
jurisdiction.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
right.
,--
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
--you're
assuming
a
state
court?
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
i
think
in
that
instance,
i
think
we
would
have
objected
to
having
to
try
the
same
case
twice,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
so
much
of
a
problem.
in
the
colorado
river
opinion,
the
court
noted
the
general
rule
which
i
think
is
rather
unarguable
that
when
there
are
two
cases
pending
in
two
federal
courts,
the
rule
is
that
you
don't
duplicate,
that
one
is
stayed
and
one
is
not.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
well,
i
think
that
decision
is
a
prudential
one,
purely
prudential
and
discretionary.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
when
there's
nothing
of
the
importance
of
the
removal
policy
involved,
i
think
the
federal
judge
in
that
case
has
to
look
to
a
whole
panoply
of
practical
considerations.
i
think
there
mayacamas
and
gulfstream
would
have
been
able
to
argue
to
the
judge
that
one
suit
was
a
reaction,
a
tactical
maneuver
responding
to
the
other.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
this
is
the
over
arching
concern
here
where
you've
got
an
historical
policy
not
to
allow
duplicative
suits
like
this.
that
is
in
fact
the
heart.
removal
does
very
funny
things
to
the
arguments
for
and
against
duplication
of
efforts.
it
really
eliminates
the
main
reason
cited
in
the
colorado
river
decision
for
allowing
a
federal
district
court
proceeding
to
duplicate
a
state
court.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
mayacamas
i
believe
maintains
its
position
that
it's
not
subject
to
in
personam
jurisdiction
on
long
arm
principles.
and
it's
position
on
that
score
has
so
far
been
turned
down.
the
georgia
court
certainly
felt
that
in
personam
jurisdiction
lies.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
have
they
made
a
special
appearance?
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
i
believe
they
have.
i
assume
they've
preserved
on
a
procedural
basis
their
right
to
continue
to
press
the
lack
of
in
personam
jurisdiction.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
that's
correct,
until
the
appeal
is
final.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
i
believe
it's
main
importance
is
deciding
whether
the
proper
ruling
by
this
court...
or
if
you
look
from
the
district
court's
point
of
view...
deciding
whether
to
stay
or
dismiss.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
well,
i
don't
think
it
does
when
you
consider
that
on
removal
to
a
federal
court
in
georgia,
all
of
mayacamas'
concerns
about
in
personam
jurisdiction
and
inconvenient
forum
would
have
been
handled
by
the
federal
district
court
under
the
exact
same
principles,
the
same
fourteenth
amendment
concerns,
the
same
georgia
statute,
presumably,
would
have
been
citable
in
the
georgia
federal
district
court.
i
don't
think
mayacamas
lost
anything,
would
have
lost
anything
if
it
had
removed
its
lawsuit.
i
think
all
those
concerns
would
have
been
dealt
with
equally
in
federal
district
court
in
georgia.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
thank
you.
just
to
begin
with
the
last
point,
i
think
it's
the
colorado
river
and
the
kerotest
decision
on
which
it
relied
in
the
two
federal
court
situation
that
would
create
the
solid
case
law
basis
for
one
or
the
other
of
those
federal
courts
deferring
to
the
other.
there's
a
strong
presumption
in
that
situation
that
you
don't
have
two
duplicative
federal
court
law
suits.
and
i
think
the
law
is
very
strong
and
certainly
clear
on
that.
the
question
arose
by
justice
scalia
and
stevens
about
whether
there
might
be
a
waiver
of
objection
to
personal
jurisdiction
in
this
situation.
the
removal
statute
itself
says
that
the
defendant
in
a
state
court
can
remove
any
time
the
district
court
would
have
had
original
jurisdiction,
whether
diversity
or
federal
question.
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
we're
talking
about
subject
matter
jurisdiction
then.
that
there's
no
premise
in
the
removal
statute
itself
that
there
must
be
in
personam
jurisdiction.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
well,
the
next
comment
that
i
was
going
to
make
was
that
this
court
had
a
decision
called
polizzi
v.
kels
magazines,
i
can
give
you
the
cite
now
or
subsequently,
in
which
there
had
been
a
removal.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
certainly.
polizzi
v.
kels
magazines,
345
u.s.
663.
mr.
elliot
l.
bien
it's
a
1953
decision
in
which
this
court
ordered
the
district
court
following
removal
to
proceed
to
examine
the
challenge
to
in
personam
jurisdiction
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
service
of
process.
that
case,
and
also
the
morris
treatise
also
cites
section
1448
of
title
28
as
instructing
the
district
court
following
a
removal,
to
look
into
all
questions
of
the
adequacy
of
service
of
process.
and
the
polizzi
decision,
i
think,
comes
pretty
close
to
the
question
that
you
raised,
that
certainly
there
would
be
no
waiver
by
mayacamas
in
that
situation.
i
think
some
of
the
colloquy
about
the
trial
setting,
one
judge
set
its
trail
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
georgia
priority
statute,
and
there
was
a
certain
lightness
about
the
colloquy,
and
mr.
ward
indicated
that
they
were
trying
to
achieve
a
certain
practical
advantage
in
this
fashion.
i'm
simply
motivated
to
cite
the
language
that
this
court
used
just
a
few
years
ago
in
the
san
carlos
apache
case
which
i
had
mentioned
earlier,
that
when
you've
got
a
federal
court
proceeding
on
a
parallel
track
with
a
state
court
lawsuit
over
the
same
issue,
now
i'm
quoting,
"it's
an
unseemly
and
destructive
race.
"
and
i
think
it's
that
very
spectacle
even
though
it
can
be,
i
think,
made
light
of
in
some
fashion,
if
you
look
at
it
that
way,
that
this
court
held
is
something
that's
very
disfavored
as
a
matter
of
federalism.
i
think
that
that
same
concern
was
expressed
by
the
framers
in
the
debates
that
i
cited
in
my
brief.
i
think
that
same
concern
about
avoiding
federal
court/state
court
tensions
in
litigation
of
this
kind
has
been
cited
with
concern
over
and
over
again
by
this
court,
most
recently
in
the
pennzoil
texaco
case
in
a
different
context
of
younger
abstention.
but
there
once
again,
you
talk
about
the
premise
upon
which
basis
our
federal
system
was
established,
that
the
federal
courts
are
not
to
gratuitously
intervene
in
situations
where
it
would
put
itself
into
a
posture
of
this
very
kind
of
conflict
and
potential
tension
with
the
state
court.
with
respect,
my
opponent
belittles
those
concerns
about
federal
and
state
relationships
as
something
that,
and
i'm
quoting,
"of
dubious
relevance"
in
today's
world
of
modern
interstate
commerce,
as
if
this
nation
had
no
further
reason
to
be
concerned
about
conflicts
between
the
national
courts
and
the
state
courts.
with
respect,
i
think
that's
a
striking
notion.
i
think
this
case
can
be
seen
as
just
perhaps
a
garden
variety
procedural
dispute
and
so
forth,
but
i
think
with
removal,
it
implicates
a
very
fundamental
federal
concern.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
