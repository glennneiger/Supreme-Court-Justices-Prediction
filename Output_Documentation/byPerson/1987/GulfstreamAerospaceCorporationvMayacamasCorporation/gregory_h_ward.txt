mr.
gregory
h.
ward
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
bien
has
pointed
out,
the
underlying
facts
in
this
particular
case
are
essentially
unremarkable.
and
the
issues
which
are
raised,
particularly
with
respect
to
determining
the
appealability
of
this
question
are
also
essentially
unremarkable.
what
we
have
here
is
a
garden
variety
civil
suit
and
a
garden
variety
procedural
question
which
was
resolved
by
the
district
court,
and
which
should
not
have
been
appealed
under
any
doctrine
which
currently
exists
or
which
should
exist,
and
which
certainly
does
not
expose
the
district
court
judge
to
review
by
the
court
on
a
writ
of
mandamus.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
your
honor,
it
is
the
intention
of
mayacamas
to
move
the
trial
court
for
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
and
also
to
request
a
new
trial.
it
is
mayacamas'
position
that
the
amount
of
the
award
which
it
received
was
reduced
by
local
sympathies
and
that
in
the
event
this
matter
were
retried,
or
tried
in
california,
that
the
amount
of
the
judgment
would
be
greater.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
yes.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
oh,
are
we
going
to
appeal
if
those
motions
are
denied?
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
cohen
doctrine
which
refers
to
the
collateral
order
exceptions
to
the
final
judgment
rule,
it's
mayacamas'
position
that
this
particular
issue
falls
short
on
all
three
of
the
points
that
must
be
satisfied
for
it
to
be
applicable.
first
of
all,
the
order
of
the
district
court
did
not
conclusively
determine
anything.
this
order
was
inherently
tentative.
the
court
refused
to
stay
its
proceedings.
but
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
court
could
not
reconsider
that
decision
throughout
the
course
of
the
litigation
as
various
circumstances
changed.
one
of
the
principal
circumstances
which
is
to
be
considered
in
a
colorado
river
analysis
is
the
relative
progress
of
the
different
litigations,
and
that
may
very
well
change
during
the
course
of
the
litigation.
i
think
that
unlike
a
circumstance
where
a
court
has
granted
a
stay,
and
there
may
be
a
conclusion
that
can
be
drawn
from
that
that
this
is
a
final
ruling,
that
is
conclusive,
which
was
this
court's
ruling
in
the
moses
h.
cone
hospital
case,
where
we
have
a
court
merely
saying,
no,
let's
proceed.
that
is
much
more
in
the
nature
of
a
tentative
ruling
which
can
be
revisited
at
any
time.
i
was
rather
surprised
by
mr.
bien's
response
to
the
questioning
by
the
chief
justice
that
if
the
court
were
to
order
a
stay
of
six
months
that
that
would
be
an
appealable
order.
it
seems
under
gulfstream's
analysis
that
any
stay
of
any
length
granted
by
a
district
court
would
be
an
appealable
order
under
this
cohen
analysis,
and
that
clearly
is
an
unreasonable
interpretation.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
i
believe
that
you
may
remove
the
case
and
maintain
your
jurisdictional
challenge,
and
raise
the
jurisdictional
challenge
in
federal
court.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
i
believe
that,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
no,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
mayacamas'
decision
was
to
bring
this
action
in
california
which
it
felt
was
the
appropriate
forum
in
light
of
the
fact
that
all
of
the
transactional
events
which
led
up
to
this
particular
contract
took
place
in
california.
mayacamas
felt
that
it
should
not
be
obligated
to
travel
across
the
country
merely
because
gulfstream
executed
its
preemptive
strike
in
instituting
the
action
first
in
georgia.
gulfstream's
argument
is
that
because
they
were
successful,
having
received
notice
from
mayacamas
that
mayacamas
felt
that
gulfstream
was
in
breach,
that
because
they
were
successful
in
instituting
the
action
in
the
first
instance
in
georgia
superior
court
that
even
though
mayacamas
as
a
plaintiff
had
the
statutory
right
to
bring
this
action
in
california
where
jurisdiction
over
gulfstream
is
not
contested,
that
mayacamas
is
limited
to
federal
court
in
georgia.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
well,
in
this
case,
your
honor,
both
cases
went
ahead
full
steam,
if
you
will.
there
were
agreements
made
between
the
various
parties
with
respect
to
use
of
discovery...
excuse
me,
i'm
speaking
outside
the
record
now
if
that's
appropriate...
to
use
of
discovery
in
both
cases.
depositions
were
taken
and
conducted
in
both
cases,
captioned
under
both
cases.
so
even
though
both
cases
were
proceeding
full
steam,
there
was
no
duplication
of
effort,
if
you
will,
with
the
exception
of
mayacamas'
effort
to
stop
the
federal
case.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
no.
the
district
court
did
have
discretion
to
stay.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
yes.
our
position
as
accepted
by
the
district
court
was
that
there
are
no
exceptional
circumstances
in
this
case
which
would
warrant
a
stay.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
there
are
no
exceptional
circumstances--
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
--well,
the
district
court
in
california
has
to
balance
the
various
factors
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
stay
under
the
colorado
river
analysis.
so
in
that
sense,
the
court
is
exercising
its
discretion
in
determining
the
weight
to
be
placed
to
the
various
factors.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
no,
your
honor,
there
are
other
abstention
doctrines,
as
well.
but
prior
to
the
colorado
river
doctrine,
i
think
that
it
was
rather
up
in
the
air.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
well,
it
should
not
be
any
different.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
your
honor,
i
have
not
addressed
that
particular
concept
since
in
this
case
we
do
not
have--
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
a
party
is
entitled
to
a
federal
forum.
a
party
is
not
entitled
to
two
federal
forums.
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
there.
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
statutory
set
up
created
by
congress
permits
mayacamas
to
institute
its
federal
action
in
california,
rather
than
remove
a
state
court
case
to
federal
court
in
georgia.
now,
gulfstream
would
argue
that
the
removal
statute
somehow
has
contained
in
it
a
limitation
on
the
forum
that
mayacamas
can
choose.
and
there
is
just
no
such
limitation
built
into
the
removal
statute.
the
removal
statute
was
created
to
allow
an
out
of
state
defendant
to
escape
the
local
prejudices
by
moving
into
a
federal
court.
this
is
an
alternative
means
of
original
jurisdiction
for
the
federal
courts.
one
of
the
principal
means
of
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
is
diversity
of
citizenship.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
the
difficulty
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that
the
standards
for
removal
on
a
forum
non
conveniens
basis
are
limited,
and
they
are
limited
to
issues
primarily
relating
to
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
witnesses.
here
we
have
a
much
more
fundamental
concern
which
is
a
challenge
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
georgia
courts
in
the
first
instance
which
would
not
be
taken
into
consideration
by
the
court
in
deciding
a
forum
non
conveniens
motion,
and
the
statutory
scheme
is
set
up
to
allow
a
plaintiff
to
have
his
choice
of
forum
and
the
forum
non
conveniens
restrictions
would
not
necessarily
and
as
mr.
bien
pointed
out,
we
conceded
that
under
the
standards
as
currently
applied
for
a
forum
non
conveniens
situation
for
a
transfer--
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
--it
may
not
have
been.
and
mayacamas
instead
relied
on
the
right
provided
by
statute
for
it
to
institute
litigation
in
a
federal
court
which
had
jurisdiction,
which
had
subject
matter
and
in
personam
jurisdiction.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
that
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction
to
proceed
in
the
action.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
no,
your
honor.
and
in
fact
if
i
may
digress
from
the
record
just
a
little
bit,
georgia
has
a
statute
which
requires
its
courts
to
set
the
matters
earlier
on
the
calendar
if
there
is
another
matter
pending
involving
the
same
issues
in
another
court.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
so
we
found
ourself
kind
of
locked
up
there.
we
had
a
trial
date
in
the
california
case
for
october
5th.
the
georgia
court
set
the
trial
for
september
26th
to
jump
in
front.
we
now
no
longer
have
a
trial
date
in
federal
court
in
california.
whether
or
not
that
is
a
stay
which
we
could
appeal
from
the
judge's
order
taking
this
matter
off
calendar
i
suppose
is
something
that
mr.
bien
said.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bien
indicates
that
the
issue
which
is
of
all
encompassing
importance
here
is
the
question
of
the
removal
statute,
and
the
important
federal
policy
restricting
the
forum
to
the
federal
court
in
georgia.
and
all
of
the
cases
he
cites,
the
local
438
case,
the
mercantile
bank
case,
the
john
mitchell
case
involving
immunity...
excuse
me,
i
shouldn't
say
that...
except
for
the
mitchell
case,
they
all
involve
the
question
where
the
federal
court
had
indicated
that
a
particular
forum
should
be
the
forum
in
which
this
matter
should
be
handled.
and
it
was
felt
by
this
court
that
a
decision
not
to
permit
the
party
to
go
forward
in
that
particular
forum
constituted
a
conclusive
determination
of
an
important
issue
which
was
not
effectively
reviewable
on
appeal.
in
the
mitchell
case,
you
had
an
immunity
situation
where
the
court
felt
that
the
obligation
was
that
the
statute
provided
that
this
individual
did
not
have
to
subject
himself
to
a
trial
in
the
first
instance,
and
therefore
that
was
an
important
federal
policy
effectively
unreviewable
on
appeal.
we
do
not
have
that
situation
here.
we
do
not
have
an
important
federal
policy
which
says
that
a
case
which
is
filed
in
a
state
court
must
be
removed
to
the
state
federal
court,
otherwise,
we're
going
to
have
a
lot
of
problems
between
state
and
federal
relations.
that's
not
found
in
any
of
the
federalist
papers
and
in
the
anti-federalist
papers,
the
purpose
for
the
removal
statute
was
merely
to
help
out
of
state
litigants
get
a
fair
trial
by
removing
the
case
to
federal
court.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
well,
if
you
assume
that
there
is
such
a
policy,
a
federal
policy
which
favors
that
forum,
then
i
think
that
what
gulfstream
is
asking
the
court
to
do
is
one
of
two
things:
either
create
a
new
abstention
doctrine
which
says
that
in
effect
that
an
action
brought
outside
of
that
forum,
the
court
must
be
dismissed.
and
gulfstream
has
indicated
in
its
papers
that
it's
not
asking
the
court
to
do
that.
what
it
is
saying
is
that
it
wants
this
court
to
make
the
failure
to
remove
a
very
significant
factor
to
be
considered
by
the
district
court
in
its
colorado
river
analysis.
in
fact,
i
think
they
indicate
that
there
should
be
a
presumption
that
there
should
be
a
stay
or
a
dismissal
taken
into
effect
by
the
district
court.
in
that
case,
our
position
is
that
the
district
court
was
aware
of
this
argument,
took
it
into
consideration,
and
that
is
the
only
factor
which
could
arguably
be
called
exceptional.
and
that
is
not
sufficient
to
overrule
the
district
court's
ruling
that
he
should
proceed
and
exercise
his
obligation
to
try
the
case.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
well,
justice
scalia
asked
me
that
question
and
i
believe
i
had
to
confess
that
i
didn't
have
any
cases
to
support
my
position
on
it,
so
i
guess
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
put
me
on
the
spot
twice,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
that's
right.
and
under
the
three
cohen
factors
which
is
the
only
reasonable
basis
on
which
argument
can
be
made
that
it
is
appealable,
although
i
guess
we
need
to
address
the
enelow/ettelson
rule
which
was
relied
on
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
permitting
an
appeal
of
these
types
of
issues.
the
order
was
not
conclusive,
it
did
not
deal
with
an
important
issue
which
was
separate
from
the
merits,
and
it
is
reviewable
on
appeal.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
should
have
stayed
the
action
is
reviewable
on
final
appeal.
no
significant
rights
are
lost
during
the
proceeding
of
this
litigation
other
than
the
fact
that
the
parties
have
to
endure
some
expense
and
some
irritation
which
has
repeatedly
been
stated
to
be
an
insufficient
basis
for
concluding
that
an
action
is
unreviewable
on
appeal.
all
of
the
points
which
are
raised
can
be
dealt
with
after
final
judgment
and
the
cohen
collateral
order
exception
is
just
not
applicable.
under
the
enelow/ettelson
rule,
which
has
been
criticized
greatly
recently,
the
simplest
way
to
deal
with
that
is,
other
than
just
indicating
that
there's
no
longer
any
basis
for
it
now
that
we
have
the
one
forum
of
action
rule,
is
that
gulfstream
is
not
attempting
here
to
interpose
an
equitable
defense
to
a
legal
claim.
it
is
merely
raising
an
equitable
consideration
which
should
be
considered
by
the
court
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
proceed
with
the
action.
the
difference
is
more
than
merely
semantic.
it's
a
defense
to
an
action,
an
equitable
defense
to
an
action
is
one
that
has
been
recognized
in
the
context
of
an
injunction
situation.
merely
raising
the
fact
that
this
case
should
not
proceed
because
of
wise
judicial
administration
issues
is
merely
an
equitable
consideration
to
be
taken
into
consideration
by
the
court
for
purposes
of
this
pretrial
matter,
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
with
respect
to
very
briefly
on
the
issue
of
mandamus,
i
think
we're
dealing
here
with
a
question
of
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
criteria
of
colorado
river
have
been
met.
clearly,
when
you're
dealing
with
a
matter
of
discretion,
it's
very
difficult
to
say
that
there
is
clear
and
indisputable
evidence
that
this
matter
should
have
been
handled
differently
by
the
district
court.
unless
there
are
any
questions
from
the
court,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
yes,
sir.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
well,
that's
certainly
problematic,
your
honor,
that
at
this
point
the
battle
has
been
lost.
certainly
if
the
district
court
judge
decides
to
overturn
the
verdict...
and
certainly
there
were
some
indications
from
the
court
during
the
course
of
the
trial
inviting--
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
--then
we're
back
on
square
one.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
and
it's
certainly
conceivable
that
the
district
court
in
california
may
choose
to
stay
the
proceedings
until
the
appeal
in
georgia
is
resolved.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
that's
correct.
if
we
win
on
jurisdiction,
then
we're
back
to
california
without
any
doubt.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
yes.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
but
we
avoided
that
in
this
situation,
your
honor,
by
having
gulfstream
file
in
state
court
and
not
removing
to
federal
court.
certainly
we
felt
that
the
issues
that
would
be
raised
by
removing
to
federal
court
and
then
filing
an
action
in
state
court
in
california
would
increase
mayacamas'
difficulties
in
getting
the
case
tried
in
california
rather
than
decrease
them.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
h.
ward
that
certainly
would
be
the
presumption.
