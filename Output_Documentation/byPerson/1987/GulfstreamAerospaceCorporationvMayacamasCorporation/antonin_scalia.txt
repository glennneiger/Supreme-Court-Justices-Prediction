justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
acknowledge
that
it's
moot
if
mayacamas
doesn't
take
an
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute.
before
you
do
that,
why
do
each
one
of
those
things
have
to
happen.
part
of
your
argument
is
that
it
would
be
res
judicata.
i
mean,
that's
essential
to
your
whole
contention
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
that's
essential
to
your
contention
that
this
is
duplicative
litigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so
res
judicata
is
assumed.
so
isn't
it
the
case
then
that
if
an
appeal
is
not
taken
this
is
over?
if
mayacamas
does
not
take
an
appeal,
this
litigation
is
over?
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
you're
arguing
that
there
is
res
judicata,
that's
part
of
your
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
between
these
parties?
these
parties
are
planning
to
go
through
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
isn't
that
what
the
capable
of
repetition
requires?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
of
the
some
others?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ward,
can
you
state
categorically
at
this
point
whether
your
client
is
going
to
appeal
from
the
georgia
judgment
if
your
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
denied?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
answer
my
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
appeal
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ward,
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent's
contention
that
you
could
have
removed
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
that
you
can
remove
a
case
even
when
you're
challenging
in
personam
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
believe
that
or
do
you
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
cases
that
hold
to
that
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
going
to
the
merits
of
the
argument,
and
for
purposes
of
determining...
are
you
arguing
the
finality
point
now?
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
purposes
of
the
finality
point,
don't
you
have
to
take
your
opponent's
argument
at
face
value,
that
his,
assuming
that
there
is
such
a
federal
policy?
otherwise,
we'd
have
to
decide
the
merits
in
order
to
decide
finality.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
had
removed
to
the
federal
court
in
georgia,
and
you
had
the
separate
suit
pending
in
california,
you
would
have
had
the
situation
where
you'd
have
two
federal
suits,
one
of
which
contains
as
a
counterclaim
and
the
other
one
of
which
contains
as
the
principal
claim
the
very
same
contention,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
even
under
those
circumstances,
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
transfer?
i
mean,
it
isn't
just...
it's
only
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
not
the
fact
that
you
have
exactly
the
same
issue
involved
that
the
court
could
take
into
account?
it
seems
a
very
strange
situation.
you
would
have
two
federal
suits,
one
counterclaim
and
the
other
one
the
claim
involving
exactly
the
same
contention.
we
don't
have
that
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
isn't
the
transfer
for
the
convenience
of
the
party
that
gets
rid
of
that
situation,
there
must
be
some
other
doctrine
that
gets
rid
of
that
situation
because
you
know,
i'm
just
unaware
of
that
proceeding
with
two
federal
courts
adjudicating
the
very
same
thing.
