justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
had
filed
in
the
federal
court
when
you
filed
your
suit
in
georgia.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
there
was
a
suit
filed
in
california.
you'd
have
had
a
different
argument
but
would
you
have
objected
to
going
forward
in
the
california
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
neither,
both
federal
courts,
you
filed
in
the
federal
court,
and
the
defendant
in
your
suit
filed
in
a
federal
court
in
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
one
or
the
other
is
stayed,
isn't
it.
now,
which
one
would
you...
how
do
you
decide
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
filed
one
day
in
georgia,
and
the
defendant
filed
the
next
day
in
california.
what's
the
california
judge
supposed
to
do
if
you
move
for
a
stay?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then
that
the
only
difference
between
the
case
i
posited
is
that
here,
removal
was
available
from
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
position
that
the
district
court
in
california
had
no
discretion
to
stay?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
just
suggest
that
it
wasn't
required
to
stay.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
you
just
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
they
had
no
discretion
to
stay
this
case,
the
federal
court
in
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
colorado
river
is
the
only
basis
for
staying
the
federal
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
this.
if
gulfstream
had
filed
in
a
federal
court
in
georgia,
and
then
you
filed
in
the
federal
court
in
california,
now
i
suppose
you
would
concede
that
the
federal
court
in
california
would
have
discretion
to
stay
its
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
should
it
be
different
if
the
georgia
case
was
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
no
colorado
river
doctrine
in
my
case
under
two
federal
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
it
odd
that
the
district
court
in
california
would
have
discretion
to
stay
its
suit
if
the
georgia
suit
were
in
the
federal
court
but
it
wouldn't
have
discretion
to
stay
its
case
when
the
georgia
suit
is
in
a
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
judgment
becomes
final
in
georgia,
do
you
agree
that
it
would
preclude
the
california
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
still
win
if
you
win
on
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
although,
if
there
are
two
federal
courts,
one
or
the
other
of
them's
going
to
stay,
isn't
it?
