what
about
the
quitter
for
cause?
someone
leaves
a
job
because
there
are
some
unacceptable
demands
made
upon
him.
is
he
treated
the
same
as
a
voluntary
quitter?
justice
scalia
well,
the
strikers
think
they
have
cause.
justice
scalia
well,
so
does
the
quitter
for
cause,
or
he
had
a
job
that
he
could
have
gone
back.
the
fact
that
it
isn't
there
is
his
choice.
justice
scalia
congress
might
also
have
thought
that
putting
a
pinky
on
the
scale
is
no
better
than
putting
a
thumb
on
the
scale.
justice
scalia
mr.
robbins,
you
assert
that
the
striker
is
in
a
different
situation
from
others
because
he
can
go
back
to
work.
the
respondent's
brief
contests
that,
at
least
in
some
situations,
or
the
appellees'
brief,
i
should
say.
it
says
that,
"in
many
instances,
a
struck
employer
will
not
operate
during
a
strike.
"
now,
what
happens
in
that
situation?
justice
scalia
including
permanent
replacement,
because
that's
the
other
example
that
the
appellees
give.
justice
scalia
what
can
he
do
then
if
he
wants
to
get
back
on
the
rolls,
what
does
he
have
to
do,
quit?
justice
scalia
suppose
he
doesn't
quit,
he
just
presents
himself
for
work?
he
says,
i'm
no
longer
on
strike,
i'm
willing
to
work.
your
plant
is
closed
but
that's
not
my
fault
any
more
at
least?
justice
scalia
and
he
continues
to
be
disqualified
even
though
he
is
no
longer
a
striker?
justice
scalia
no,
he
doesn't.
he
says,
i'm
ready
to
work
now.
i'm
no
longer
on
strike.
justice
scalia
is
it
possible
that
the
1977
committee
report
was
false?
justice
scalia
was
false?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
i
thought
the
government
had
given
some
examples
of
how
the
chief
wage
earner's
failure
to
provide
necessary
information
in
order
to
get
the
stamps,
for
example,
would
disqualify
the
entire
family.
isn't
that
true?
justice
scalia
sixty
days
or
until
the
head
of
the
household
complies?
justice
scalia
whichever
is
shorter.
but
if
the
head
of
the
household
just
refuses
to
work
although
work
is
available,
the
whole
family's
disqualified?
justice
scalia
you
could
consider
this
to
be
a
series
of
acts,
as
well.
the
worker
who
is
on
strike
refuses
day
by
day
to
go
to
work.
justice
scalia
that's
different.
justice
scalia
mr.
mchugh,
we
haven't
examined
the
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
specifically
the
provisions
that
render
unlawful
or
impose
certain
adverse
consequences
for
particular
types
of
strikes,
we
haven't
reviewed
those
under
a
strict
scrutiny
standard,
have
we?
justice
scalia
well,
how,
why
wouldn't
we
if--
justice
scalia
--well,
i
don't
know
of
any.
justice
scalia
oh.
you
think
that
the
taft-hartley
act,
in
all
of
its
provisions
relating
to
strikes
would
have
to
be
scrutinized
strictly?
because
you
have
the
same
factors
here
if
you're
relying
on
the
insular
nature
of
the
labor
union
movement
and
traditionally
subjected
to
disfavorable
treatment,
as
you
say,
we
have--
justice
scalia
--well,
irrational,
i
have
no
problem.
if
you're
just
doing
ordinary
scrutiny,
that
i
understand.
but
i
thought
you
were
urging
strict
scrutiny
here?
justice
scalia
mr.
mchugh,
i
still
don't
understand
whether
you're
urging
just
ordinary
scrutiny
or
strict
scrutiny
when
you
begin
talking
first
amendment
and
associational
rights,
that
doesn't
mean
anything
different
to
me
than
just
talking
equal
protection,
unless
what
you're
implying
by
that
is
that
we
have
to
examine
with
strict
scrutiny
whether
the
justification
for
this
particular
provision
is
valid.
you
can
burden
associational
rights,
the
government
can,
if
the
reason
is
significant
enough,
but
we
will
subject
that
reason
to
strict
scrutiny.
and
that's
what
you
want
us
to
do,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
strict
scrutiny.
justice
scalia
so
you
are
urging
strict
scrutiny,
which
brings
us
back
to
my
prior
question.
why
don't
we
apply
strict
scrutiny
to
the
national
labor
relations
act?
