what
is
the
purpose
of
that
exception
do
you
think,
mr.
robbins?
justice
blackmun
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
it
was
a
change
in
the
political
climate
that
brought
about
the
'81
amendment?
justice
blackmun
but
it
never
was
passed
over
the
years.
justice
blackmun
the
practical
consequence
for
the
children
is
that
the
father
has
to
leave
home,
isn't
it?
justice
blackmun
of
course,
the
pro
rata
possibility
could
have
been
considered
and
was
considered
in
other
elements
of
the
statute,
wasn't
it?
justice
blackmun
of
just
reducing
the
food
stamp
allocation
for
the
striker
individually
and
preserving
the
food
stamps
for
the
children.
this
kind
of
thing
is
present
in
other
aspects
of
the
statute?
justice
blackmun
do
you
think
your
position
draws
strength
from
harris
against
mcrae.
do
you
really
think
that?
justice
blackmun
because
there
it
was
an
extension
of
benefits
that
was
sought.
here,
it's
just
the
opposite.
well,
i
disagree
with
you,
i'd
mention.
