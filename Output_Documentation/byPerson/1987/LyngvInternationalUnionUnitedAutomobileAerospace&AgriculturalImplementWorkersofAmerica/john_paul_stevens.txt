mr.
mchugh,
do
you
concede
the
statute
would
be
constitutional
if
it
merely
disqualified
strikers
for
90
days,
and
their
families?
justice
stevens
even
though,
during
that
90
day
period,
it
took
the
milk
away
from
the
children
and
the
family.
so
you're
really
not
relying
on
the
first
amendment
associational
right
at
all,
as
i
understand
you
now.
because
that
would
apply
in
the
90
day
period.
the
arguments
about
infringement
of
the
right
of
association
both
with
the
union
and
with
members
of
the
family
would
equally
apply
to
a
90-day
disqualification,
and
i
understand
now
you're
abandoning
those
arguments.
justice
stevens
so
really
it
seems
to
me
in
bottom,
you're
making
an
equal
protection
argument,
rather
than
a
first
amendment
argument?
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
heart
of
your
case?
justice
stevens
well,
it
really
seems
to
me
that
you've
abandoned
the
first
amendment
argument
because
you
seem
to
agree
that
if
it
were
limited
to
a
90-day
disqualification
that
it
would
be
okay
to
disqualify
people,
even
though
you're
taking
milk
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
babies
in
the
family.
justice
stevens
well,
it
seems
to
me
it
makes
a
big
difference
in
remedy,
too,
because
if
this
is
the
correct
theory,
the
district
court
presumably
should
have
just
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
insofar
as
it
disqualified
strikers'
families
for
the
90-day
period,
for
a
period
beyond
90
days,
i
mean.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
this
would
be
different
if
in
addition
to
food
stamps,
you
also
had
some
other
forms
of
subsidy
like
free
hospital
care
and
free
bus
ride
and
things
like
that,
then
that
would
be
like
harris
against
mcrae?
