justice
o'connor
mr.
robbins,
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
one
of
the
purposes
was
to
somehow
effect
or
establish
national
labor
policy
in
any
way?
was
this
just
a
budget
device
to
save
money,
or
was
the
exception
in
there
to
further
some
labor
policy
of
the
government?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
mchugh,
do
you
think
the
constitution
prohibits
congress
from
disqualifying
for
food
stamps,
families
of
voluntary
quitters?
justice
o'connor
well,
does
it,
or
not?
does
the
constitution
forbid
congress
from
disqualifying
families
for
food
stamps
of
voluntary
quitters?
justice
o'connor
i
guess
i
just
don't
understand
your
answer.
suppose
all
we
had
in
front
of
us
was
a
provision
that
said
if
you
voluntarily
quit
work,
you
and
your
family
are
not
eligible
for
food
stamps.
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
o'connor
well,
then
why
can't
strikers
be
treated
the
same?
justice
o'connor
mr.
mchugh,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
good
many
of
the
laws
in
the
labor-relations
area
can
be
said
to
burden
association
rights.
for
example,
there
are
laws
under
taft-hartley
directly
restricting
the
freedom
of
employees
to
engage
in
various
kinds
of
concerted
activity.
and
we've
not
held
that
those
violate
the
first
amendment.
so
it's
a
little
odd,
anyway,
to
argue
that
in
this
context
you
can't
indirectly
do
the
same
thing
you
can
do
directly
as
congress
in
restricting
associational
right.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
government
argues
that
that's
one
of
the
purposes
of
this.
it's
a
form
of
labor
regulation
in
effect.
now,
i
specifically
asked
them
that
at
the
outset
of
the
argument.
now,
to
that
extent,
i
guess
this
could
survive
under
traditional
labor
law
analysis
under
first
amendment
claims.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
depends
on
whether
we
view
it
as
a
social
welfare
program
or
as
a
form
of
labor
policy.
