chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-1471,
richard
lyng
v.
international
union.
mr.
robbins,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
mchugh.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
traditionally
under
rational
basis,
people
attacking
a
law
on
equal
protection
grounds
have
a
heavy
burden
to
carry.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
your
argument
is
essentially
the
equal
protection
argument
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
i
realize
that.
but
i
thought
perhaps
you
weren't
making
exactly
the
same
arguments
that
appealed
to
the
district
court
in
its
opinion.
am
i
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
are
you
supporting
all
of
the
district
court's
opinion
in
your
argument
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
then,
do
i
gather
that
separate
from
your
equal
protection
argument
which
you've
just
made,
you're
also
making
a
first
amendment
attack
on
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
just
haven't
gotten
to
that,
yet?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
well,
maybe
we
should
give
you
a
chance
to
do
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
this
strikes
me
as
more
equal
protection,
but
perhaps
i'm
wrong.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
in
citizens
for
rent
on
the
contributions,
we
had
held
in
buckley
v.
moreno,
as
some
people
have
said,
that
money
is
speech,
and
therefore
there
was
probably
an
independent
first
amendment
ground
in
citizens
against
rent
control
to
analyze
the
thing
in
first
amendment
terms
since
it
was
regulating
something
that
was
the
form
of
speech.
now,
do
you
think
that
those
same
grounds
are
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
that
suggest
that
all
labor
relations
type
laws
of
the
first
category
have
to
be
put
in
the
same
statute,
and
that
congress
can't
in
another
statute
perhaps,
a
bill
sent
in
by
another
department,
they
couldn't
have
a
regulation
of
labor
relations?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
understand
your
second
distinction.
why
is
it
different
from
the
abortion
disqualification
is
triggered
by
the
fact
that
you're
getting
an
abortion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mchugh.
the
case
is
submitted.
