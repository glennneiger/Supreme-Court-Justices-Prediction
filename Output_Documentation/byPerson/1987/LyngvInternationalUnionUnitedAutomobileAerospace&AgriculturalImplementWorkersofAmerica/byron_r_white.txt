justice
white
what
about
the
voluntary
quitter?
justice
white
he's
off
the
food
stamps
what,
for
ninety
days?
justice
white
and
the
striker
is
off
for
as
long
as
he's
on
strike?
justice
white
and
isn't
it
also
true
of
just
the
deadbeat
who
doesn't
want
to
work
at
all?
justice
white
how
about
the
voluntary
quitter,
does
he
have
to
take
a
job,
another
job
to
stay
on
food
stamps?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
about
the
person
who
just
decides
he
doesn't
want
to
work
anymore,
ever?
justice
white
well,
then,
as
long
as
he
won't
work,
the
household
would
be
disqualified.
justice
white
well,
that
makes
hash
out
of
the
work
requirement.
justice
white
but
it's
the
whole
family
though
that
would
be
disqualified.
justice
white
well,
that
is
a
provision,
then
that
disqualifies
the
whole
family
because
of
conduct
of
the
head
of
the
household.
justice
white
yeah,
but
ninety
days
they're
disqualified,
they
and
their
families?
justice
white
then
they
have
to
register?
justice
white
and
if
they
don't
register
and
take
work,
they
are
off
food
stamps
again?
justice
white
meanwhile
for
sixty
days,
they
are
back
on
food
stamps.
justice
white
and
so
that
would
be
just
like
the
striker,
then?
justice
white
yes.
well,
if
they
engaged
in
the
same
conduct
the
striker
did
saying,
i'm
not
going
to
work,
they
would
be
off?
justice
white
is
that
right,
or
not?
justice
white
but
the
voluntary
quitter
at
the
end
of
90
days,
he
has
to
register,
but
if
it's
evident
that
he
won't
work,
he
stays
off
food
stamps,
doesn't
he?
justice
white
just
like
a
striker?
justice
white
but
you
would
want
to
be
treated
better
than
the
voluntary
quitter?
justice
white
well,
the
voluntary
quitter
if
he
doesn't
want
to
work
is
going
to
stay
off
food
stamps.
justice
white
and
furthermore,
your
striker
doesn't
have
to
go
and
register
for
work
elsewhere.
justice
white
what
about
now?
do
they
have
to
register
and
be
available
for
work
elsewhere?
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
but
under
your
thesis,
the
striker
would
have
to
do
what?
justice
white
so
strikers
are
off
food
stamps
for
90
days?
justice
white
ninety
days.
justice
white
and
then
he
has
to
register
for
other
work?
justice
white
but
if
he
said
i
don't
want
to
work
because
i'm
on
strike,
he's
off
for
good?
