mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
1981
amendment
to
the
food
stamp
act
in
issue
here
treats
strikers
and
their
households
uniquely.
no
other
food
stamp
provision
sanctions
individual
actions
by
disqualifying
an
entire
needy
household
by
the
full
duration
of
their
need
for
food
stamps.
whether
examined
under
a
fifth
amendment
rational
basis
test,
or
under
the
first
amendment's
requirement
of
a
substantial
justification,
and
a
narrow
tailoring
the
statute
in
the
words
of
district
judge
oberdorfer,
fails
to
pass
constitutional
muster.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
i'm
not
aware
of
any
other
food
stamp
disqualification
that
would
act
to
disqualify
the
family
for
the
full
duration
of
its
need,
basically
for
the
length
of
the
strike
in
this
case.
i
think
the
example
he
was
referring
to
is
when
he
referred
to
the
head
of
household
refusing
work
or
refusing
to
accept
a
job
for
minimum
wage,
that's
a
sixty
day
disqualification
or
until
the
head
of
the
household
complies.
i
think
that's
also
true
in
the
need
for
information.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
complies,
right,
whichever's
shorter.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
for
sixty
days,
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
i
am
not
sure
what
that
situation
is
but
i
believe
you
would
have
a
continuing
requirement
to
register
for
work
and
to
be
available
for
work,
and
i
suppose--
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
--that
would
be
a
single
act.
that
would
be
a
series
of
acts
that
triggered
the
sixty-day
disqualifications.
in
any
event,
i
don't
think
it's--
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
--no,
i
think
they
would
continue
to
assess
sixty-day
penalties,
but
it
would
be
for
separate
refusals.
in
other
words,
you
would
have
sixty
days
to
register
and
comply
and
if
you
didn't,
at
the
end
of
that
and
you
continued
to
refuse,
then
at
that
point,
they
would
assess
another
sixty
day
disqualification.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
if
the
work
is
suitable
and
if
the
person
is
the
head
of
the
household.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
well,
if
the
plant
is
either
operating
and
the
person
can
go
back,
or
if
the
person
has
not
been
permanently
replaced.
i
think
that
the
permanent
replacement
situation
is,
i
would
disagree
with
my
opponent
a
little
bit
on
that.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
the
district
court
made
a
specific
finding
that
the
length
of
the
disqualification
was
indeterminate
for
the
length
of
the
strike
and
found
that
there
were
numerous
instances
in
the
record
where
people
had
been
permanently
replaced
and
remained
disqualified.
the
policy
that
the
government
is
relying
on
here
is
a
letter
from
the
usda
officials
to
other
regional
usda
officials.
the
manual
material...
that's
the
state
welfare
manual
material
that
the
workers
use,
we
put
in
the
record
material
from
kentucky
and
michigan,
and
there
was
no
mention
of
a
permanent
replacement,
and
in
fact
there's
no
instance
in
the
record
where
somebody
permanently
replaced
did
get
stamps
as
a
result
of
this
alleged
policy.
it's
not
in
regulatory
form,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
government
can
really
rely
on
it
here
to
save
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
i
think
that
that's
a
very
important
consideration
in
this
case.
as
was
pointed
out--
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
--i
think
that
the
constitution
prohibits
congress
from
doing
that
when
similarly
situated
families
of
voluntary
quitters
or
refusers
of
work
are
not
treated
as
punitively
as
the
families
of
strikers.
for
example,
voluntary
quitters
have
the
opportunity
to
show
good
cause
and
there
are
many
situations
when
people
on
strike
go
on
strike
for
identical
circumstances
as
would
be
good
cause
for
voluntarily
quitting,
and
their
families
would
have
no
penalty
imposed,
but
since
the
member
of
their
household
is
on
strike,
they're
taken
off
the
stamps
completely
for
the
duration
of
the
strike.
so
i
think
it's
the
similarly
situated
comparison
that
makes
it
unconstitutional,
not
just
taking
the
families
off
per
se
under
the
equal
protection
theory.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
because
voluntary
quitters
are
not
treated
that
way.
voluntary
quitters
have
a
ninety-day
disqualification
at
the
worst,
and
then
they
are
eligible
even
though
they
turn
their
back
on
income
just
like
the
strikers
did,
and
even
though
they
walked
away
from
income
and
made
themselves
eligible
for
food
stamps.
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
made
clear,
in
castillo,
for
example,
that
similarly
situated
individuals
have
to
be
treated
similarly
to
satisfy
the
rationality
requirement
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
so--
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
that
would
be
true,
but
i
think
in
a
typical
case--
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
--no.
if
they
refused
at
the
outset,
and
they
went
in
and
on
their
application
they
didn't
register,
they
wouldn't
be
eligible.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
well,
it
would
be
the
same
effect
in
terms
of
food
stamps,
yes.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
i
think
what
you're
asking
me
to
do--
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
--yes.
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
not
only
do
i
have
to
show
that
it
doesn't
comparably
treat
voluntary
quitters,
but
that
it
doesn't
similarly
treat
voluntary
quitters
who
also
refuse
to
work,
which
i
think
is
a
pretty
heavy
burden
to
carry
under
the
rational
basis
theory.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
well,
that
would
be
true,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
we
can
carry
this
burden
in
this
case
because
it's
not
the
same
case
as
gilliard
or
castillo,
which
this
court
decided
in
the
last
two
terms.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
well,
except
that
strikers
are
not
always
able
to
waltz
back
into
their
job,
as
my
opponent
said.
there
are
many
cases
where...
there
are
cases
in
the
record.
johnie
blake
was
permanently
replaced.
the
union
offered
to
go
back
to
work.
the
employer
refused
to
take
them
back
because
he
had
permanently
replaced
them,
which
he's
entitled
to
do
on
economic
strikers,
and
she
still
continued
to
be
disqualified
for
food
stamps
for
months
after
that,
her
and
her
grandchildren
and
her
children.
in
other
situations,
they're
not
operating
and
counsel
has
conceded
that
even
in
those
situations,
people
are
still
going
to
be
disqualified.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
no.
all
we
need
to
do
is
be
treated
the
same
as
the
voluntary
quitter.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
these
people,
even
if
they
seek
other
types
of
work--
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
--yes.
prior
to
1981,
strikers
had
to
register
for
work
and
be
available
for
other
work,
but
not
the
work
at
the
struck
plant.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
well,
now
they're
just
simply
not
available.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
i
mean,
they're
not
eligible.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
under
our
comparison,
what
we
would
say
is
if
they
treated
strikers
exactly
like
voluntary
quitters,
that
would
be--
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
--if
it's
the
primary
wage
earner?
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
right.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
right,
and
be
available
for
all
other
work
except
the
struck
work.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
right,
but
that
would
be
fine
because
i
think
he
should
be
subject
to
the
same
comparable
requirements
of
the
food
stamp
program
which
requires
that
you
be
available
for
all
work
except
work
that's
vacant
due
to
a
labor
dispute.
only
in
the
case
of
strikers
and
their
households
is
the
government
saying
we're
going
to
take
that
additional
step
and
provide
that
economic
incentive
for
someone
to
have
to
cross
their
picket
line,
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that's
advancing
neutrality,
which
is
the
rationale
that
the
government
is
trying
to
argue.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
yes,
i
don't
see
how
we
could
come
before
the
court
and
make
a
similarly
situated
argument.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
i
think
that
where
the
associational
freedom
must
come
in
is
if
we
compare
the
food
stamp
treatment
of
voluntary
quitters
and
those
who
strike.
a
person
who
voluntarily
leaves
for
a
number
of
reasons
that
amount
to
good
cause
under
the
statute
has
no
penalty.
however,
if
they
leave
to
express
their
disagreement
with
their
employer
in
concert
with
other
individuals,
then
they
are
penalized.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
shows
what's
triggering
the
disqualification
is
not
the
individual
leaving
work,
but
the
fact
that
they're
leaving
work
in
concert
with
others.
and
that's
the
reason
there's
an
associational
right
here.
now,
under
your
hypothetical,
you're
saying
we're
going
to
treat
even
under
associational
purposes,
it
seems
to
me,
there's
that
discriminatory
element.
if
you're
going
to
treat
voluntary
quitters
and
strikers
alike,
even
though
one
is
leaving
for
reasons
of
association
and
one
is
leaving
for
his
own
individual
reasons,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
going
to
create
a
constitutional
problem,
i
guess.
although
it
may
still
create
a
constitutional
problem
if
there's
no
substantial
justification.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
well,
i
think
that
the
equal
protection
argument
is
a
narrower
grounds
for
the
court
to
affirm
the
district
court.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
and
i'm
not
sure
i
need
to
make
that
concession
because
it
seems
like
if
it
is
a
right
of
association,
then
it
seems
like
to
me
that
the
interest
that
the
government
has
put
forward
are
not
the
substantial
interests
that
are
necessary
under
the
first
amendment.
they
haven't
even
tried
to
justify
it
in
the
first
amendment
context.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
right.
and
so
presumably
the
district
court
disagreed
with
me
earlier,
i
think.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
i
think
that
where
the
governments
cases
dealing
with
the
pervasive
regulation
of
the
right
to
strike
in
labor
relations
context
really
fail
is
there
you
are
regulating
striking
as
an
economic
activity
viz
a
viz
employers.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
well,
in
those
areas,
the
court
was
concerned
about
employers'
property
rights
and
the
public
interest
involved
in
regulating
strikers.
they
haven't
put
those
interests
forward
in
this
case,
and
i
guess
i
would
disagree
that
you
can
read
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision
as
being
congress
acting
in
the
labor
relations
context.
i
think
what
they
said
was
in
the
context
of
a
social
welfare
program,
we
think
this
advances
neutrality
by
withdrawing
the
support
from
strikers
and
their
families,
but
i
don't
think
that
they
said,
we're
doing
this
as
part
of
an
addition
to
the
taft-hartley
act
to
regulate
striking
or
any
of
the
other
federal
legislation
that
this
court
has
upheld.
so
it
seems
like
the
first
amendment
basically
limits
government,
and
when
government
acts
viz
a
viz
the
individual
in
a
social
welfare
program
and
triggers
that
action
based
upon
the
associational
nature,
it
seems
like
to
me
you've
got
a
completely
different
type
of
situation.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
well
certainly
the
explicit
objects
of
the
legislation
are
to
promote
the
agricultural
economy
and
to
alleviate
hunger
by
providing
assistance
to
families
whose
need
is
so
low
that
they
can't
afford
to
purchase
an
adequate
diet,
and
it
doesn't
say
that
they're
also
accomplishing
labor-relations
type
activity.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
no,
i
don't
believe
you
have,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
i
don't
know
of
any
cases--
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
--i'm
not
sure
you've
reviewed
them
at
all
in
the
first
amendment
light,
i
guess.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
well,
the
district
court,
i
think
at
that
point
was
really
trying
to
make
the
case
more
like
moreno
and
less
like
castillo,
and
it
seems
like
to
me
what
the
district
court
was
doing
there
was
looking
at
the
part
of
moreno
where
the
court
said
that
the
bare
desire
to
harm
a
politically
unpopular
group
was
not
a
legitimate
government
activity.
now,
we're
not
arguing
that
the
disqualification
of
strikers
would
not
be
a
legitimate
government
purpose.
what
we're
arguing
is
that
the
way
they've
accomplished
it
is
irrational
when
you
compare
it
to
the
treatment
of
strikers.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
no,
we've
never
argued
strict
scrutiny
before
this
court
or
before
the
court
below.
i
think
that
in
an
effort
to
make
us
look
more
like
the
decisions
that
you
reversed
in
castillo,
the
solicitor
has
attempted
to
say
that
this
is
a
strict
scrutiny
case
or
that
we
want
it
to
be
a
strict
scrutiny
case.
but
certainly
under
equal
protection
what
we
have
indicated
is
that
a
rational
basis
test
is
enough.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
under
the
first
amendment,
i
think
there
are
two
discrete
independent
grounds
that
the
district
court
held
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
you
think
that
i'm
not
making
exactly?
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
if
the
district
court
in
the
equal
protection
context
applied
more
than
a
rational
basis
test,
i
don't
think
that
we
need
to
do
that.
i
think
that
under
moreno,
this
case,
moreno
is
very
applicable
to
this
case,
i
think.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
i'll
accept
your
invitation,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
this
court
has
held
in
a
long
line
of
cases
that
while
the
government
is
free
to
deny
a
benefit
or
privilege
for
any
reason,
there
are
some
reasons
that
it
can't
deny
a
benefit
or
privilege.
and
these
would
include
the
first
amendment
limitations
on
the
right
of
the
government
to
impose
conditions
on
the
receipt
of
a
benefit
which
would
burden
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
comparison
of
the
treatment
of
voluntary
quitters
who
quit
for
good
cause
for
reasons
of
in
opposition
if
they
leave
because
of
discrimination,
because
of
unsafe
working
conditions
or
for
other
unreasonable
working
conditions,
they
escape
penalty
completely.
people
who
leave
in
concert
with
others
under
the
very
same
conditions--
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
--well,
i
think
the
case
that
best
shows
the
associational
nature
that
this
court
has
looked
at
is
citizens
against
rent
control
v.
city
of
berkeley.
now,
in
that
case,
this
court
examined
an
ordinance
which
limited
individual
contributions
to
committees
to
oppose
ballot
provisions
of
$250.
however,
an
individual
could
contribute
as
much
money
as
he
wanted
as
an
individual
to
the
cause.
and
the
court
said
well,
since
you're
limiting
only
contributions
from
groups,
it's
obviously
a
regulation
of
associational
activity.
now,
it
seems
to
me
the
same
analogy
holds
here.
what
is
triggering
the
disqualification
is
not
the
economic
activity
of
striking
or
turning
your
back
on
employment.
it
is
turning
your
back
on
employment
with
other
people.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
i
think
that
there
are
other
areas
where
you've
looked
at
associational
rights
where
it's
not
as
clear.
for
example,
in
speiser
v.
randall,
which
i
guess
to
some
extent
was
a
due
process
case,
but
has
later
come
in,
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
first
amendment,
that
was
the
denial
of
a
tax
exemption...
and
i
don't
think
you
particularly
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
get
a
tax
exemption...
you
just
have
a
first
amendment
right
not
to
have
the
tax
exemption
conditioned
on
the
foregoing
of
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
and
i
think
that's
where
the
government
misstates
what
the
state
of
the
law
is.
in
terms
of
they
are
saying
that
since
there's
no
direct
prohibition
on
striking
or
on
associational
rights,
it
only
regulates
striking.
then
the
indirect
effects,
if
you
can
call
them
indirect
in
the
sense
that
they
aren't
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
can
be
ignored.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
district
court
felt
that
that
was
true,
because
he
recognized
it
even
though
it
was
burdening
more
than
just
the
right
to
strike.
it
was
burdening
this
associational...
the
right
to
express
your
disagreement
with
your
employer
by
leaving
in
association
with
others.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
i
think
i
would
like
this
court
to
say
that
there's
an
associational
element
here
and
that
the
government
would
have
to
show
a
substantial
justification.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
and
they
haven't
even
tried
to
do
so.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
well,
one
reason
would
be
there
you
are
not
discriminating
among
certain
kinds
of
associates,
you're
not
saying
that
we
are
disapproving
of
a
type
of
associational
activity,
you're
only
setting
up
a
framework
that's
basically
neutral
or
helping
at
least
in
adjusting
the
relationships
between
employers
and
employees.
but
in
this
situation,
you
are
dealing
with
a
situation
where
it's
the
government
viz
a
viz
individuals
and
i
think
that
that
is
perhaps
one
difference
in
the
sense
that
the
first
amendment
primarily
goes
to
limit
governments
and
doesn't
apply
to
the
same
extent
when
you're
talking
about
the
adjustment
of
relations
between
private
parties.
because
then
you
have
other
interests
such
as
property
interest,
antitrust
and
other
things
that
the
court
has
pointed
to
in
the
lincoln
federal
labor
case
and
other
cases
that
the
government
cites
for
this
pervasive
regulation
of
striking.
so
it
seems
like
to
me
that's
what
makes
this
case
different.
you
have
definitely
indicated
in
your
cases
that
where
the
government
does
something
directly
in
terms
of
acting
on
people
in
the
associational
context
that
that
is
different
from
where
it's
doing
it
by
just
letting
it
happen
between
private
parties.
for
example,
you've
said
in
thornhill
v.
alabama,
the
court
said
that
it's
one
thing
for
the
state
to
regulate
the
give
and
take
of
industrial
combatants;
it's
another
thing
for
the
government
to
come
in
and
limit
the
rights
of
speech
in
the
area
of
industrial
controversies.
and
it
seems
like
to
me
that
that's
the
same
distinction
i'm
trying
to
make
here.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
no.
i
just
think
this
is
not
a
labor
relations
statute
and
that
was
not
really
the
purpose
that
congress
had.
what
they
apparently
were
concerned
about
was...
or
at
least
the
proponents
of
this
amendment
were...
that
people
might
be
able
to
be
at
a
better
advantage
and
not
have
to
settle
labor
disputes
more
to
the
liking
of
employers.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
makes
it
a
labor
relations
regulation
just
because
it
impinges
on
strikes.
healy
v.
james
is
another
case
i
think
in
the
first
amendment
area
is
similar
in
terms
of
going
to
this
indirect
direct
distinction
that
i'm
discussing.
there
the
court
looked
at
the
non-recognition
by
a
state
university
of
a
student
organization
and
said
that
the
fact
that
they
couldn't
use
the
meeting
rooms
or
the
bulletin
boards
at
the
university
was
enough
of
an
impermissible
burden
on
the
right
of
association
to
be
a
serious
constitutional
problem.
in
effect,
what
happened
in
healy
v.
james
was
similar
to
the
government's
subsidy
argument,
the
university
basically
just
declined
to
make
available
to
the
student
organization,
the
same
facilities
that
it
normally
made
available
to
other
student
organizations.
i
want
to
touch
before
my
time
is
up
on
the
subsidy
funding
argument.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
things
that
make
this
case
different
from
the
medicaid
abortion
cases
which
the
government
attempts
to
rely
on.
first
of
all,
when
you
look
at
the
comparison
between
voluntary
quitters
who
quit
for
good
cause
and
strikers
who
quit
for
identical
reasons,
there
is
no
plausible
explanation
for
that
distinction
other
than
the
government's
disagreement
with
the
viewpoint
that's
being
expressed
by
the
people
who
quit
in
concert
with
other
people.
and
this
is
a
first
amendment
element
that
the
court
has
not
permitted
even
in
the
subsidy
area.
secondly,
in
the
abortion
cases,
the
court
said
that
while
government
is
under
no
obligation
to
remove
obstacles
not
of
its
own
making
when
people
want
to
exercise
protected
rights,
in
this
case
the
obstacle
was
poverty.
the
court
still
recognized
in
those
cases
that
the
government
could
not
turn
around
and
put
an
obstacle
in
the
place
of
somebody
because
they
exercised
a
protected
right.
and
it
seems
like
to
me
that
that's
a
fundamental
distinction
that
this
court
recognized
both
in
mahere
and
in
harris
v.
mcrae.
clearly
this
is
the
situation
here
where
the
striker
provision
is
triggered
by
the
exercise
of
associational
rights
and
is
an
obstacle
placed
in
the
path
of
strikers
based
upon
their
exercise
of
associational
rights.
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
well,
the
court
in
the
harris
case
made
the
distinction
basically
saying
that
you
have
a
range
of
medical
services
that
are
potentially
available
and
the
government
simply
withdraws
funding
from
one
of
those
but
doesn't
disqualify
the
woman
from
medicaid
generally,
that's
different
from
the
situation
in
sherbert
v.
verner
where
the
person
lost
all
their
benefits.
the
court
made
that
distinction
in
footnote
19
of
the
harris
opinion.
and
similarly
here
this
really
isn't
a
decision
to--
mr.
richard
walker
mchugh
--yes.
i
think
if
there
was
a
range
of
services
and
one
was
being
withdrawn
it
perhaps
would
fit
more
under
harris
v.
mcrae.
but
this
isn't
really
a
situation--
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
