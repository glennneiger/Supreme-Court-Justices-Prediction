mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
23
years
since
the
food
stamp
act
of
1964
was
enacted,
congress
has
many
times
considered
and
several
times
enacted
measures
designed
to
restrict
the
availability
of
food
stamps
to
households
with
members
who
were
on
strike.
in
1981,
the
97th
congress
enacted
an
amendment
to
the
food
stamp
act
now
codified
at
7
u.s.c.
2015(d)(3)
whose
constitutionality
is
at
issue
in
the
case
this
morning.
that
amendment
generally
provides
that
households
that
contain
strikers
are
not
eligible
for
food
stamps
by
reason
of
the
loss
of
income
occasioned
by
the
strike.
it
provides
moreover
that
households
eligible
for
food
stamps
prior
to
the
strike
will
retain
their
eligibility
but
will
not
receive
any
additional
food
stamps
by
reason
of
that
loss
of
income.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think,
justice
blackmun,
that
congress
sought
to
strike
what
i
would
call
a
balance
of
competing
interests.
by
retaining
the
eligibility,
households
were
placed
in
no
worse
position
by
virtue
of
the
strike.
congress
simply
sought
not
to
permit
the
loss
of
income
occasioned
by
the
strike
itself
to
increase
the
eligibility
for
food
stamps.
so
in
that
sense,
it
doesn't
deprive
households
of
an
eligibility
that
vested
prior
to
the
time
the
strike
began.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
congress
sought
to
promote
three
objectives,
and
it
articulated
those
objectives
in
the
accompanying
senate
report,
i
believe
it's
97-35,
that
accompanied
the
legislation
in
1931.
those
three
purposes
are
first,
as
your
honor
mentioned,
to
achieve
what
congress
wished
to
be
dramatic
changes
in
its
words,
in
the
federal
spending
policy.
congress
sought
to
reduce
the
overall
cost
of
the
food
stamp
program
and
the
congressional
budget
office
estimated
in
fact
that
the
amendment
actually
adopted
in
2015(d)(3)
would
save
approximately
$165
million
in
food
stamp
outlays
over
the
three
year
period
1982
to
1984.
but
there
were
two
other
objectives
as
well,
apart
from
simple
saving
of
revenue.
first,
congress
believed
that
it
was
tying
the
receipt
of
food
stamps
to
the
ability
and
willingness
to
work.
it
thought
that
was
consistent
with
the
balance
of
the
food
stamp
scheme.
it
believed
and
said,
that
strikers
have
foregone
available
employment
voluntarily
and
that
union
strike
funds
should
be
the
principal
source
of
benefits
during
a
work
stoppage.
finally
and
more
clearly
i
think
directed
to
your
honor's
question,
congress
attempted
to
promote
additional
governmental
neutrality
in
labor
disputes.
it
believed
that
providing
food
stamps
to
striking
workers
is
an
incentive
to
wait
out
management,
in
the
senate
committee's
words,
rather
than
to
reach
compromises.
and
it
decided
that
it
wished
to
withdraw
that
incentive
from
labor
management's
disputes.
now,
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
recognized
that
these
were
rational
goals
and
that
the
legislation
enacted
in
2015(d)(3)
is,
to
use
the
district
court's
words,
"rationally
related
to
legitimate
legislative
objectives.
"
but
it
struck
the
statute
down
anyway.
applying
a
rather
loose
amalgam
of
rational
based
and
heightened
scrutiny,
the
court
found
that
the
statute
irrationally
discriminated
against
strikers,
unlawfully
impinges
on
their
free
association
rights
as
well
as
the
rights
of
their
families
and
their
unions
to
free
association
and
exacts
an
excessive
price
for
the
protected
right
to
strike.
we
believe
each
of
these
conclusions
to
be
mistaken
and
we
ask
this
court
this
morning
to
reverse.
let
me
turn
first,
if
i
might,
to
the
equal
protection
claim
in
the
case.
it
is
common
ground
that
section
2015(d)(3)
as
social
welfare
legislation
survives
equal
protection
scrutiny
if
it
is
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose.
we
have
no
doubt
that
it
is.
but
let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
we
proceed
in
this
argument
on
the
assumption
that
congress
articulated
its
real
purposes
for
the
statute
when
it
enacted
it.
i
mention
that
seemingly
uncontroversial
point
because
the
amicus
party
in
this
case
has
suggested
that
congress'
articulated
purposes
are
in
fact
a
camouflage
for
the
anti-labor
and
anti-union
animus
that
ostensibly
in
reality
motivated
the
enactment.
but
that
claim
is
manifestly
false,
resting
as
it
does
on
remarks
made
in
years
past
by
opponents
about
precursors
of
the
current
legislation.
we
prefer
to
take
congress
at
its
word,
and
i
turn
directly
therefore
to
the
reasons
that
congress
actually
articulated
as
rational
bases
for
the
distinction
that
it
drew
in
the
statute.
let
me
start
with
the
cost
savings
goal.
in
1981,
congress
confronted
an
economy
that
it
believed
to
be
in
considerable
financial
distress.
it
therefore
resolved
to
make
across
the
board
cuts
in
a
great
many
federal
programs.
several
of
those
were
made
in
the
food
stamp
program,
and
section
2015(d)(3)
reflects
one
of
them.
now,
appellees
do
not
dispute
that
the
government
may
legitimately
pursue
cost
savings,
but
they
argue
that
savings
alone
cannot
justify
irrational
distinctions.
and
we
agree.
distinctions
that
are
otherwise
irrational
are
not
made
rational
simply
because
they
save
the
government
money.
but
the
need
to
conserve
funds
makes
distinctions
inevitable.
and
when
distinctions
must
inevitably
be
made,
it
is
equally
inevitable
that
some
persons,
often
with
a
great
deal
in
common,
will
fall
within
and
without
the
favored
circle.
here,
congress
drew
a
dividing
line
rationally
grounded
in
the
determination
that
strikers
at
least
have
a
job
to
go
back
to
and
have
union
strike
funds
to
rely
on.
in
those
critical
respects,
congress
reasonably
concluded
that
strikers
may
more
easily
than
other
persons
absorb
the
necessary
reduction
in
available
benefits.
once
it
is
seen
that
congress
drew
a
rational
line
in
its
effort
to
conserve
funds,
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
bowen
against
gilliard
instructs
that
the
statute
that
it
enacted--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
what
i
certainly
intended
to
say,
justice
marshall,
is
that
congress
could
rationally
have
decided
that
a
person
with
a
job
to
go
back
to
when
he
chooses
to
is
better
off
than
someone
who
has
no
job
prospects
at
all.
and
that
we
think
is
one
of
the
determinations
that
congress
made
in
enacting
this
statute.
and
we
regard
it
as
a
reasonable
and
rational
one
for
congress
to
have
made.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
justice
white,
the
voluntary
quitter
is
treated
differently
under
the
statute
in
certain
respects
but
congress
could
rationally
have
decided
that
that
distinction
was
warranted.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
and
there
are
we
think
several
reasons
why
that
distinction
survives
equal
protection
scrutiny.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
that
is
not
equally
true.
there
are
work
registration
requirements
that
must
be
satisfied.
the
law
provides
equally
that
someone
must
take
available
work
at
the
applicable
minimum
wage,
and
the
failure
to
do
so
disqualifies
both
that
deadbeat
and
his
household.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
yes
he
does.
he
is
disqualified
for
ninety
days
and
when
that
ninety-day
disqualification
has
lapsed,
he
too
must
register
for
work
and
take
it
if
it's
available.
and
that
really
tells
us,
i
think,
precisely
why
this
distinction
that's
been
drawn
and
that
very
much
persuaded
the
district
court
really
misdirects
the
eye.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
he's
not,
justice
scalia.
there
is
a
distinction
drawn
in
the
statute
that
permits
a
voluntary
quitter
to
leave
for
cause
and
not
absorb
the
ninety-day
period
of
ineligibility.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
they
do,
and
they
also
have
a
job
to
go
back
to
and
that
we
think
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
true,
but
he
severed
the
relationship.
in
both
cases,
they
have
made
a
choice,
it's
true,
and
in
both
cases
the
choice
may
equally
derive
from
a
believe
that
they
have
good
cause.
but
we
think
that
congress
could
rationally
decide
that
the
two
persons,
one
who
quit
for
cause
and
one
who
struck
for
cause
are
not
similarly
situated
in
one
critical
respect.
one
of
them
has
severed
that
employment
relationship
and
that
job
is
gone.
he
can't
waltz
back
in
when
he's
decided
that
his
cause
was
either
not
the
right
cause
or
not
a
compelling
enough
cause.
he's
left
his
job.
there
is
not
a
job
waiting
for
him
to
return
to.
and
there's
yet
another
distinction.
congress
obviously
was
trying
to
serve
several
ends
at
once,
and
one
of
the
ends
that
it
articulated
in
the
committee
report
was
the
goal
of
labor
neutrality.
we
thin
that
congress
could
rationally
decide
that
extending
food
stamps
to
persons
who
have
quit
does
not
implicate
the
government
in
the
support
of
one
side
of
an
on-going
labor
dispute.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
when
the
household
is
ineligible,
all
members
of
that
household
by
definition
are
ineligible.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
of
neutrality?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
justice
brennan,
is
that
the
food
stamp
statute,
like
many
other
federal
statutes,
is
predicated
on
a
household
categorization,
a
household
categorization
that
this
court
recognized
and
accepted
two
terms
ago
in
lyng
against
castillo.
it
is
not
the
intent
of
the
statute
in
particular
to
visit
special
burdens
on
the
children
uniquely,
as
for
example,
this
court
considered
in
the
plyler
against
doe
case.
rather,
it
makes
a
judgment
about
household
income
and
because
the
statute,
like
many
other
statutes,
like
the
statute
in
dandridge
against
williams,
like
the
statute
in
bowen
against
gilliard,
because
those
statutes,
like
many
social
welfare
statutes
operate
and
attach
consequences--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think,
justice
brennan--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
the
answer
is
that
congress
believed
that
by
funding
by
replacing
the
household
income
given
up
by
a
striker
which
congress
thought
to
be
given
up
voluntarily,
it
was
withdrawing
a
subsidy
that
it
thought
impaired
the
free
flow
of
labor
negotiations.
now,
by
necessity,
when
you
refuse
to
replace
income
to
a
household,
it
has
harsh
implications
in
particular
cases.
even,
we
suggest,
were
you
to
look
at
this
only
as
income
not
replaced
to
the
individual
striker,
that
wouldn't
change
the
fact
that
it
has
implications
for
his
entire
household.
the
fact
is
that
this
statute,
like
many
others,
operates
on
a
household
basis.
and
consequences
visited
to
individuals
have
consequences
for
their
families.
that
is
a
decision
that
congress
looked
square
in
the
eye
and
decided
was
outweighed
by
the
goals
it
sought
to
promote.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
they
could
have,
justice
marshall.
they
certainly
considered
explicitly.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
justice
marshall,
i
am
unwilling
as
a
policy
matter
to
second
guess
a
judgment
that
its
quite
clear
congress
had
before
it.
there
was
testimony
about
the
consequences
and
indeed--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
don't
think
that's
what
congress
meant
to
do
at
all.
i
think
congress
meant
to
do
what
it
said
it
was
doing
and
it
did
so
in
the
face
of
a
sure
recognition
that
there
were
adverse
consequences
for
the
families
of
strikers.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
including
children
without
milk.
congress
has
debated
proposals
like
this
for
twenty
years,
and
for
a
great
many
years
the
opponents
of
this
legislation
held
sway,
articulating
precisely
these
kinds
of
consequences.
these
kinds
of
consequences,
however,
justice
marshall,
are
present
every
time
congress
makes
changes
in
social
welfare
legislation.
it
was
equally
true
in
dandridge,
it
was
equally
true
in
castillo,
it
was
equally
true
in
bowen
against
gilliard,
and
it's
true
today
as
well.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
would
hesitate,
justice
blackmun,
to
assign
any
special
factor
to
that
decision.
i
think
there
has
been
considerable
support
for
this
legislation
for
many
many
years.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
was
never
passed
by
both
houses
over
the
years.
and
whether
it's
the
fact
that
the
political
climate
changed,
or
congress
recognized
that
the
economic
crises
that
it
perceived
in
1981
had
grown
too
great,
that
the
peril
that
it
thought
it
was
addressing
by
a
broad-based
package
of
legislation
now
merited
some
important
changes
in
many
programs.
all
of
those
factors
may
have
entered
into
it.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no.
i
think
that's
no
more
true
in
this
case,
justice
blackmun,
than
it
was
in
castillo
and
in
gilliard
or
certainly
in
castillo
when
precisely
the
same
argument
was
made
and
rejected
by
this
court.
i
think
the
same
logic
suggests
that
the
impact
for
purposes
of
dissociating
families
is
no
greater
here
than
in
those
cases.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
the
possibility
of?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
correct.
there
are
certain
parts
of
the
statute
that
attach
a
consequence
only
for
the
person
who
has
taken
certain
action.
for
example,
the
fraud
provision
has
that
aspect.
although
i
might
add,
justice
blackmun
that
many
many
other
parts
of
the
statute
attach
consequences
for
the
whole
household.
the
refusal
o
register,
the
refusal
to
take
a
job
at
the
minimum
wage,
the
refusal
to
provide
certain
kinds
of
reported
information
on
an
annual
basis,
all
of
those
things
attach
consequences
on
a
household
basis.
and
this
is
consistent
with
all
of
those.
yes,
it's
true
to
answer
your
question
that
congress
could
have
cut
the
line
more
finely,
but
it
is
only
constitutionally
required
to
do
so
when
there
is
a
basis
for
heightened
scrutiny
for
either
the
inference
of
a
suspect
classification
or
the
inference
of
a
fundamental
right.
there
is
neither
in
this
case
and
this
court's
decisions
make
quite
clear
that
in
the
absence
of
a
constitutional
warrant
for
heightened
scrutiny,
there
is
accordingly
no
reason
to
require
the
congress
to
divide
its
distinctions
more
finely.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
the
concern
was
for
additional
governmental
neutrality.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think,
justice
brennan,
when
the
statute
was
finally
passed,
the
empirical
evidence
was
a
little
bit
more
equivocal
than
it
was
before
the
congress
when
it
refused
to
pass
the
statute
many
years
earlier.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
correct,
justice
brennan.
the
fact
is,
however,
that
by
1981,
the
congressional
budget
office
was
estimating
that
this
particular
amendment
would
engender
savings
on
the
order
of
$165
million
over
a
three-year
period.
the
senate
report,
i
might
add,
noted
the
prior
findings
of
the
general
accounting
office.
it
indicated
that
it
found
the
evidence
somewhat
ambiguous
as
to
which
estimate
was
correct,
that
it
varied
over
the
lot.
it
considered
the
various
empirical
findings
including
the
one
to
which
you
refer,
and
in
the
end
it
went
with
the
estimate
from
the
congressional
budget
office.
that
is
a
classically
political
judgment.
the
decision
about
whether
the
empirical
evidence
is
persuasive
enough
is
precisely
the
kind
that
this
court
has
consistently
said
is
consigned
to
the
political
process,
and
justly
so.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
correct.
the
view
about
neutrality
is
of
course
that
involvement
of
the
government
at
all
is
unwarranted
and
it
wished
to
withdraw
that
support,
which
may
not
turn
precisely
on
how
powerful
that
support
is.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
depends
on
how
it
is
and
why
it
is
that
the
struck
employer
does
not
operate.
if
it's
a
lockout
or
if
it's
the
permanent
replacement
of
a
striker,
that
does
not
trigger
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
in
that
event,
the
striker
is
no
longer
deemed
to
be
on
strike
and
is
intended
to
receive
benefits
under
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
including
permanent
replacements.
and
the
evidence
that
that
is
the
secretary's
policy
was
before
the
district
court.
if,
however,
the
plant
closes
because
it
is
simply
no
longer
economically
feasible
to
maintain
it
because
of
the
strike,
that
does
not
change
the
ineligibility
provisions.
in
that
event,
the
striker
has
by
his
voluntary
efforts
together
with
the
rest
of
his
union
ensured
that
there's
no
longer
a
job
available,
just
like
the
plaintiffs
did
in
the
hodory
case
and
in
baker
against
general
motors.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
he
can
quit.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
under
those
circumstances
obviously
there
isn't
the
option,
under
your
hypothetical,
of
taking
the
job
because
it's
not
available
right
then.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
still
the
culmination
of
a
voluntary
effort
and
to
that
extent
there
is
still
the
distinction
between
the
striker
who
has
together
with
others
engendered
this
state
of
affairs
than
other
persons
who
have
voluntarily
left
work.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
he's
still
a
striker
in
a
sense--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--but
by
virtue
of
the
decision
he
made
earlier,
the
employer
can
no
longer
maintain
the
plant,
and
in
that
event,
although
he
doesn't
have
the
job
available,
certain
other
purposes
that
congress
was
also
seeking
to
promote
are
still
applicable
in
that
event,
such
as
the
decision
not
to
become
involved
in
an
on-going
labor
dispute,
the
goal
of
neutrality
and
the
goal
of
voluntary
unemployment.
let
me
turn
since
my
time
is
almost
at
an
end
to
the
first
amendment
challenge
in
this
case.
we
think
that
the
first
amendment
claim
founders
on
two
central
misconceptions.
first,
we
believe
that
appellees
exaggerate
the
range
of
protected
conduct
effected
by
the
statute.
like
the
district
court,
they
analyze
the
statute
as
if
its
provisions
were
triggered
by
the
exercise
of
any
of
a
wide
array
of
first
amendment
rights.
in
fact,
however,
it
is
only
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
strike
that
is
at
issue,
and
the
right
to
strike
consistent
with
its
rather
subordinate
place
in
the
constitutional
hierarchy
has
historically
been
subjected
to
considerable
regulation
by
congress.
second,
appellees
overstate
the
way
in
which
the
statute
actually
affects
the
right
to
strike.
the
statute,
after
all,
does
not
prohibit
it,
does
not
state
the
occasions
on
which
it
may
be
offered
or
may
be
exercised.
all
it
does
is
restrict
food
stamp
eligibility
for
households
that
contain
members
on
strike
and
it
does
so
only
for
the
length
of
the
strike.
that
we
think
is
a
difference
of
constitutional
proportions.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
correct,
justice
brennan.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
they
did
fail.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
justice
brennan,
congress
is
not
frozen
in
time.
part
of
the
political
process
allows
for
the
possibility
that
congress
can
change.
in
1977,
the
proponents
of
this
statute
were
defeated.
in
1981,
the
opponents
of
this
statute
were
defeated.
that
is
something
that
happens
all
the
time
in
the
political
process.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
a
claim
made
by
an
opponent
of
the
legislation
about
its
precursor
is
a
legitimate
way
in
which
to
account
for
the
reasons
that
moved
a
congress
four
years
later
to
do
something
very
different.
now,
let
me
just
say
about
the
first
amendment
claim--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--was
false?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
could
be
that
it
was
wrong,
it
could
be
that
it
was
overstated,
it
could
be
that
like
some
other
committee
reports,
it
exaggerates
the
strength
of
its
arguments,
and
it
could
be
that
what
was
true
then
is
no
longer
true
about
what
moved
a
subsequent
congress
to
do
something
that
a
prior
congress
rejected.
that
wouldn't
be
surprising,
think,
and
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time.
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
first
amendment
claim
in
this
case
fails.
and
the
two
reasons
are
defined
by
this
court's
decision
in
gilliard
at
the
tail
end
of
last
year's
term.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
first
amendment
free
association
claim
is
only
implicated
when
it
is
a
statute
whose
"design
and
direct
effect
is
to
intrude
on
those
first
amendment
interests.
"
in
this
case,
of
course,
neither
of
those
standards
is
met,
first
because
it
is
surely
not
the
design
of
the
statute
to
impair
free
association
claims.
it
is
first
of
all
not
triggered
by
a
significantly
protected
first
amendment
right.
the
right
to
strike,
as
we've
outlined
in
our
reply
brief,
has
historically
been,
as
justice
jackson
put
it
in
the
uaw
case,
more
vulnerable
to
regulation
than
the
right
to
organize
and
select
representatives
for
lawful
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
indeed,
the
history
of
labor
law
is
largely
defined
by
an
on-going
process
of
adjusting
the
competing
claims
of
strikers,
their
employers
and
the
public
at
large.
and
that
historical
process
is
only
possible
by
virtue
of
the
fact,
and
indeed
it
reflects
the
fact
that
the
right
to
strike
is
not
graven
in
some
first
amendment
stone.
and
second,
the
statute
does
not
as
in
the
words
of
the
bowen
against
gilliard
case
directly
impair
that
first
amendment
right.
because
like
the
decision,
like
the
decision
in
harris
against
mcrae
and
the
decisions
in
castillo
and
in
gilliard,
it
simply
withdraws
funding
where
it
does
not
affirmatively
fund
the
protected
right.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
it
draws
considerable
strength,
and
indeed,
i
think
this
is
a
stronger
case,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
in
that
case,
congress
decided
not
to
include
a
certain
kind
of
constitutionally
protected
conduct
within
the
aegis
of
the
medicaid
statute.
here,
there's
not
even
the
same
kind
of
claim,
we
don't
think,
that
the
right
to
strike
has
anything
close
to
the
kind
of
constitutional
protection
that
was
recognized
in
harris
against
mcrae,
and
it's
simply
a
failure
to
fund,
just
as
it
was
there.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think,
justice
brennan,
that
the
moreno
case
which
after
all
was
also
a
rational
based
case,
even
though
the
statute
was
triggered
by
an
associational
claim,
is
different
in
that
this
court
was
able
to
find
in
the
legislative
history,
statements
by
the
proponents
of
the
legislation
that
it
was
animated
by
anti-hippie
animus,
that
in
fact,
this
was
an
effort
to
penalize
an
historically
disfavored
and
insular
minority.
there's
no
such
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
this
court
thought
in
moreno
that
this
was
a
group
that
had
been
certain
kinds
of...
within
the
political
process,
had
been
given
certain
kinds
of
disadvantages
and
that
this
statute
reflected
that.
thank
you.
