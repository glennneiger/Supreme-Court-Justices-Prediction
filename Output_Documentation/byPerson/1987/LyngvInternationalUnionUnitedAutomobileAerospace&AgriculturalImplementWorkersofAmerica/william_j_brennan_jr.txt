justice
jr.
well,
mr.
robbins,
i
gather
that
when
the
household
is
disqualified,
also
the
children
in
the
household
are
disqualified,
are
they
not?
justice
jr.
yes.
now,
how
in
heaven's
name
does
that
serve
the
objective
of
neutrality?
justice
jr.
to
disqualify
the
children?
justice
jr.
that
doesn't
tell
me
how
that
serves
the
objective
of
neutrality.
justice
jr.
under
this
statute.
justice
jr.
mr.
robbins,
i
think
you
argued
earlier
that
one
of
the
concerns
is
that
the
government
would
be
subsidizing
strikers,
wasn't
it,
if
they
were
not
disqualified
for
food
stamps.
justice
jr.
yes.
well
just
how
much
money
was
involved?
didn't
that
1975
study
by
gao
show
that
89
to
96
percent
of
all
strikers...
this
is
before
the
'81
amendment...
did
not
participate
in
the
food
stamp
program,
and
further
the
cost
of
what
there
was
in
'75
was
only.2
to.3
percent
of
all
non-public
assistance
food
stamp
households.
isn't
that
right?
justice
jr.
well,
it's
not
so
many
years.
those
figures
i
thought
were
1975,
isn't
that
right,
and
the
statute
was
1981?
justice
jr.
mr.
robbins,
they
tried
to
get
this
amendment
through
in
1977,
did
they
not?
justice
jr.
and
they
failed,
didn't
they?
justice
jr.
and
didn't
the
report
then
say
the
reason
it
failed
was
that
the
real
purpose
of
the
amendment
was
not
to
restore
some
government
neutrality
allegedly
lost
because
strikers
are
eligible
for
food
stamps,
but
on
the
contrary,
to
use
a
denial
of
food
stamps
as
a
pressure
on
the
worker,
or
more
accurately
his
family,
to
help
break
a
strike.
the
amendment
was
an
effort
to
increase
the
power
of
management
over
workers
using
food
as
weapon
in
collective
bargaining.
that
wasn't
true
in
'81?
justice
jr.
mr.
robbins,
what
about
moreno?
justice
jr.
why
do
you
say
historically
disfavored?
the
hippies
weren't
historically
disfavored,
were
they?
