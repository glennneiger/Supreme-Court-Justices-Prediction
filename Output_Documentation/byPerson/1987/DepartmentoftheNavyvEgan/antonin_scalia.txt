justice
scalia
what
if
an
agency
establishes
as
a
qualification
for
a
particular
job,
high
skill
level.
and
then
it
makes
a
separate
determination
that
this
individual
who
has
been
in
the
job
does
not
have
a
high
skill
level,
and
another
part
of
the
agency
makes
that
determination.
do
you
have
any
doubt
that
the
mspb
would
determine
whether
that
judgment
was
true
or
not?
justice
scalia
so
what
is
the
law?
you
can't
just
be
relying
upon
the
language
of
the
statute
and
say
you
cannot
go
behind
the
fact
that
there
was
a
cause
for
removal,
and
that
the
cause
had
been
determined
to
exist
by
the
agency,
and
not
look
into
whether
it
was
properly
determined.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
not
compelled
by
statute.
you're
really
just
arguing
that
this
language
of
the
statute
allows
you
to
draw
this
line.
it
certainly
doesn't
compel
it.
justice
scalia
because
of
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
what
the
determination
was
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
before
you
get
into
that,
as
to
the
first
point
which
you
just
went
off
of,
you
said
prior
to
the
new
legislation,
the
civil
service
commission
hadn't
reviewed
it.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
the
civil
service
commission
didn't
review,
aren't
there,
that
used
to
be
reviewed
by
court
that
have
been
given
to
the
mspb.
you
certainly
can't
say
that
everything
that
the
mspb
now
has
was
matter
that
the
civil
service
commission
used
to
have.
some
of
it
would
never
go
through
the
civil
service
commission,
but
would
go
directly
to
the
courts.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
there
were
court
decisions
that
had
made
this
kind
of
an
inquiry
before
the
civil
service
reform
act
was
passed,
weren't
there?
hadn't
the
d.c.
circuit
looked
into
denial
of
security
clearances?
justice
scalia
you're
aware
of
no
pre-csra
court
decisions
that
did
effectively
what
the
mspb
was
doing
here?
justice
scalia
what
does
the
employee
lose
if
the
government
chooses
to
move
under
7532
rather
than
7513
or
whatever?
justice
scalia
but
apart
from
that,
apart
from
its
affect
on
the
employee,
it
would
preserve
the
government's
concerns,
entirely?
the
government
could
protect
itself
as
well
under
7532
as
it
could
under
7513.
justice
scalia
it
isn't
just
that.
if
the
only
difference
between
7532
and
7513
were
the
absence
of
msbp
review,
then
you'd
have
a
very
strong
case.
but
7532
does
much
more
than
that.
it
allows
that
person
to
be
taken
out
of
the
job
and
off
of
the
payroll
immediately
without
any
prior
procedures,
and
that
can
be
the
explanation
of
it,
rather
than
what
you
suggest.
justice
scalia
denial
of
a
security
clearance
is
no
more
misconduct
than
what
you
just
described.
what
you
just
described
would
be
adequate
grounds
for
denial
of
a
security
clearance
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
he
is
given
it
by
the
agency
as
the
agency's
regulations
now
exist.
it's
not
in
the
csra,
but
the
agency
does
give
him
a
hearing.
so
in
point
of
fact,
there's
no
difference
right
now
between
what
happens
under
7513
and
7532.
justice
scalia
you're
saying
the
agency
isn't
compelled
to
give
him
a
hearing,
it's
a
matter
of
agency
grace?
justice
scalia
all
they
have
to
do
is
put
this
security
clearance
call
in
another
division
of
the
navy
and
everything
would
be
fine.
you'd
have
no
complaints,
right?
justice
scalia
well,
why
isn't
that
enough.
it
has
to
be
in
the
military
half
of
the
navy?
is
there
a
military
half
and
a
civilian
half?
justice
scalia
let
me
ask
you
something
about
the
statutory
structure
here.
the
test
for
security
clearance
under
the
executive
order
is
whether
the
employment
of
the
individual
in
the
job
would
be
clearly
consistent...
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
the
national
security.
now,
that's
a
fairly
strict
test.
there
are
two
basic
sections
of
the
csra
43,
which
you
mentioned
earlier,
which
permits
removal
for
poor
job
performance.
and
the
mspb
reviews
those
determinations
on
the
basis
of
substantial
evidence?
justice
scalia
right.
and
congress
did
it
that
way
because
congress,
as
i
recall
the
legislative
history,
knew
that
it's
hard
to
prove.
justice
scalia
that's
right,
and
it's
hard
to
prove
inadequate
performance,
so
they
said
substantial
evidence
will
do
there.
then
it
has
section
75
which
has
a
different
review
standard
for
the
mspb.
there,
it's
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
more
likely
than
not.
now,
if
congress
did
want
to
have
these
things
reviewed,
i
find
it
incredible
that
it
would
want
them
reviewed
under
75,
under
a
preponderance
standard.
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
this
was
clearly
consistent,
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
the
national
security.
that's
a
very
strange
test.
if
i
were
going
to
have
that
reviewed,
i
would
have
had
it
reviewed
under
title
43,
chapter
43
which
would
be
there
is
substantial
evidence
that
this
would
not
be
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
the
national
security.
justice
scalia
mr.
nold,
i'm
trying
to
think
if
what
congress
would
have
done
to
be
sure
that
the
mspb
would
handle
this
thing
the
way
that
you're
saying
they
expected
it
to.
and
the
analogy
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
that
when
this
court
was
in
the
same
position
that
the
mspb
is
in,
that
is
to
say,
before
the
1976
amendments
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
were
adopted,
we
were
asked
to
review,
among
other
things,
one
of
the
exemptions
to
the
act
is
whether
the
information
was
classified
in
the
interests
of
national
security.
and
we
decided
that
that
was
not
an
invitation
for
us
to
go
into
whether
the
classification
was
correct
or
not.
we
just
looked
into
whether
it
was
classified
or
not.
now,
congress
didn't
like
that
and
they
therefore
provided
that
we
would
look
into
whether
it
was
properly
classified.
but
without
saying
that,
we
just
didn't
go
behind
the
determination
that
it
was
classified.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
exactly
the
same
kind
of
thing
that
the
mspb
is
confronted
with.
justice
scalia
that's
because
the
statute
was
changed.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
under
the
old
statute,
which
reads
for
purposes
of
classification
the
way
this
legislation
reads
for
purposes
of
security
clearance,
we
thought
it
appropriate
as
a
court
to
say,
well,
it
means
we
look
to
see
whether
it's
classified,
not
whether
the
classification
is
proper.
you
want
the
mspb
to
look
into
not
merely
whether
the
fellow
doesn't
have
a
security
clearance,
but
whether
it
was
proper
to
deny
him
a
security
clearance.
it's
certainly
not
what
we
would
have
done.
