mr.
louis
r.
cohen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
after
stating
the
background
of
this
case,
i
will
argue
that
the
navy's
decision
not
to
grant
someone
with
respondent's
history
a
security
clearance
to
work
on
repairing
nuclear
submarines
is
not
and
should
not
be
subject
to
substantive
review
by
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
the
board
has
in
certain
cases
including
this
one
power
to
review
the
procedures
followed
by
the
employing
agency
in
denying
a
clearance
but
there
has
been
no
challenge
to
the
procedures
followed
by
the
navy
in
this
case.
the
board
does
not
have
authority
to
review
the
merits
of
a
procedurally
proper
agency
decision
to
deny
a
clearance.
respondent
had
a
job
at
the
trident
refit
facility
in
bremerton,
washington,
that
entailed
access
to
the
interiors
of
nuclear
submarines
and
knowledge
of
their
arrivals
and
departures.
the
job
was
conditioned
on
his
obtaining
a
security
clearance.
the
security
investigation
disclosed
a
history
of
incidents
involving
firearms,
alcohol
and
violent
behavior.
after
giving
respondent
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
respond,
the
naval
systems
personnel
command
in
washington,
d.c.
denied
the
clearance,
and
the
trident
facility
in
the
state
of
washington
removed
respondent
from
the
job
for
cause
for
failure
to
meet
one
of
the
job's
requirements.
respondent
petitioned
the
merit
systems
protection
board
for
a
review.
the
board
presiding
official
issued
an
initial
decision
reversing
the
removal
on
the
ground
that
the
navy
failed
to
show,
i'm
quoting,
"it
reached
a
reasonable
and
warranted
decision
concerning
the
propriety
of
the
revocation
of
appellant's
security
clearance.
"
the
board
reversed
its
presiding
official
and
sustained
the
removal.
it
ruled
that
in
an
appeal
from
a
removal
for
lack
of
a
required
security
clearance,
the
agency
must
satisfy
the
board
that
the
position
in
question
required
a
clearance,
that
the
clearance
was
denied
or
revoked,
and
that
the
agency
afforded
the
employee
procedural
due
process
in
connection
with
the
clearance
determination,
which
it
specifically
found
the
agency
had
done
here.
but
the
board
said...
and
i'm
quoting
again...
"it
has
no
authority
to
review
the
agency's
stated
reasons
for
the
clearance
determination.
"
we
think
the
board
got
it
right.
let
me
begin
by
disposing
i
hope
of
the
argument
that
due
process
requires
a
hearing
on
the
merits
before
the
mspb
on
the
security
clearance
determination.
i
want
to
make
two
points.
the
first
is
that
there
simply
is
no
due
process
question
in
this
case.
respondent
was
given
notice
of
the
navy's
intent
to
deny
his
clearance,
and
a
full
statement
of
reasons
and
an
opportunity
to
respond.
his
response,
with
the
assistance
of
his
union,
did
not
challenge
any
fact
in
the
navy's
statement,
he
did
not
ask
to
confront
or
cross
examine
anyone
or
to
be
heard
further
by
the
navy.
when
he
sought
review
by
the
mspb,
he
did
not
challenge
the
adequacy
of
the
navy's
processes,
and
although
the
presiding
official
was
willing
to
hear
him
on
the
merits
of
the
clearance
determination,
he
twice
failed
to
respond
to
the
board's
notice
that
a
hearing
would
be
convened
at
his
request.
the
only
thing
he
has
placed
in
issue
in
this
case
is
the
navy's
judgment,
based
on
the
results
of
the
investigation,
that
a
clearance
should
be
denied.
second
and
more
generally,
it
is
the
employing
agency
that
must
given
an
employee
whatever
process
is
due
in
connection
with
the
denial
of
a
clearance.
where
the
employee
does
contend
that
the
employing
agency
has
not
given
him
an
adequate
opportunity
to
be
heard,
the
mspb's
job,
is
it
itself
said,
to
rule
on
the
adequacy
of
the
agency's
process.
the
mspb's
decision
is
of
course
subject
to
review
by
the
federal
circuit.
but
the
constitution
does
not
require
or
authorize
the
mspb
to
take
upon
itself
the
process
of
hearing
and
deciding
the
merits
of
the
clearance
question.
nor,
we
think,
does
the
statute.
and
i
want
to
turn
to
the
question
whether
5
u.s.c.
7513
gives
the
mspb
power
to
review
denial
of
mr.
egan's
clearance
on
its
merits.
the
first
thing
i
want
to
say
is
that
the
board's
answer
that
it
can
review
procedures
but
not
substance,
seems
to
us
the
most
plausible
reading
of
the
statutory
text.
everyone
agrees
that
mr.
egan
had
a
right
to
be
removed
only
for
cause
under
section
7513,
and
the
right
to
appeal
his
removal
to
the
mspb.
everyone
also
agrees
that
the
mspb
has
no
general
jurisdiction
to
review
the
denial
of
a
security
clearance
as
such.
for
example,
an
employee
who
loses
a
promotion
or
an
employee
who
is
simply
transferred
to
a
different
job,
or
who
doesn't
get
access
to
a
particular
part
of
the
facility
because
he
isn't
given
a
security
clearance
has
no
mspb
review
because
there's
nothing
for
the
board's
jurisdiction
to
attach
to.
the
board
said
in
essence
that
if
an
agency
fails
to
follow
the
proper
procedures
so
that
there
has
been
no
valid
security
clearance
determination,
then
there
is
no
cause
for
the
removal.
but
if
the
agency
has
followed
proper
procedures,
and
has
reached
a
determination
denying
a
clearance,
then
nothing
in
the
statute
gives
the
board
the
right
to
reverse
the
clearance
determination,
or
disregard
it,
just
because
the
agency
has
not
persuaded
the
board.
in
addition
to
thinking
that
this
is
the
most
plausible
reading
of
the
statute,
we
have
two--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
it
should
go
to
any
adverse
action.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
board's
power
to
review
the
merits
of
collateral
determinations
that
lead
to
adverse
actions
is
a
question
that
the
board
is
in
the
process
of
working
out.
but
in
general,
if
someone
is
denied
a
job
because,
for
example,
he
is
found
to
be
medically
unfit,
found
to
have
a
medical
condition,
i
take
it
that
the
board
would
review
whether
the
existence
of
that
medical
condition
is
cause
for
removal
from
that
job,
but
wouldn't
review
the
medical
determination
itself
on
the
merits.
i
do
think
that
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
the
board
should
probe
underlying
collateral
decisions
is
one
that
may
vary
from
case
to
case,
depending
on
what
the
underlying
decision
is.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
it
did.
those
are,
as
our
opponents
have
pointed
out,
decisions
that
will
have
been
rendered
by
someone
other
than
the
employing
agency.
that's
only
partially
true
here.
here,
two
different
parts
of
the
navy
made
these
two
different
determinations.
but,
yes,
the
board
did
mention
that.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
in
the
event
of
wrongdoing,
the
agency
is
required
to
persuade
the
board
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
wrongdoing
occurred
because
that
is
the
cause
for
the
removal.
here,
the
cause
for
the
removal
is
the
lack
of
a
security
clearance
which
is
a
separate
determination,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
separate
determination
by
a
different
part
of
the
agency
is
subject
to
review
by
the
preponderance
standard.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no.
i
think
that
it
probably
would.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i'm
not
just
relying
on
the
language
of
the
statute.
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
statute
creates
problem
that
exists
in
a
number
of
cases
of
how
far
you
look
behind
the
final
action
of
the
agency
that
is
subject
to
mspb
review
and
look
into
the
merits
of
collateral
decisions.
i
think
the
agency
drew
the
right
line
in
this
case
because
of
the
nature
of
the
decision
and
because
of
the
history
of
these
kinds
of
decisions.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
my
words
were,
it
is
the
most
plausible
application
of
the
statute
to
this
case.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
all
right,
yes.
it's
certainly
not
compelled
by
the
words
of
the
statute.
there
are
two
other
closely
related
reasons
for
thinking
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
confer
the
power
to
review
these
decisions
on
the
mspb.
one
of
them
is
historical.
the
civil
service
commission
did
not
review
security
clearance
determinations
by
employing
agencies.
the
mspb
generally
inherited
the
csc's
review
powers,
and
there's
simply
no
evidence
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
mspb
larger
powers
in
this
respect.
the
other,
which
i
think
explains
why
the
civil
service
commission
did
not
review
clearance
determinations
is
that
outside
review
of
the
merits
of
clearance
determinations
by
a
defense
agency
is
functionally
inappropriate.
the
navy
should,
after
affording
an
employee
an
adequate
chance
to
be
heard,
have
the
final
say
about
whether
it
trusts
him
on
board
one
of
its
submarines.
and
i
want
to
make
three
points
about
the
nature
of
that
decision.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
that's
right.
but
i
also
think
that
where
that
is
the
case,
it
is
explicit
or
at
least
affirmatively
indicated
in
the
legislative
history
and
that
there
is
legislative
history
suggesting
a
presumption
of
continuation
of
the
civil
service
commission's
jurisdiction
without
expansion
except
where
there's
other
evidence.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
actually,
the
d.c.
circuit
case,
the
hoska
case
came
up
after
the
civil
service
reform
act
was
passed,
and
in
that
case,
after
an
mspb
presiding
official
affirmed
the
agency's
determination
and
there
was
no
petition
to
the
full
board,
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
hoska
case
reviewed
that
determination
and
reversed
it
on
the
merits.
we
think
that
decision
is
wrong.
and
the
mspb
concluded
in
this
case
that
that
decision
is
wrong.
we've
said
that
right
along.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
that's
right,
not
in
the
context
of
a
government
employee.
the
overriding
objective
of
a
security
clearance
determination
is
to
protect
information
and
not
individuals.
the
president's
instructions
to
the
navy
and
to
other
defense
agencies
that
no
one
is
to
have
a
job
entailing
access
to
classified
information
unless
there
has
been
a
determination
that
it
is
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
the
national
security
are
controlling.
the
final
substantive
judgment
should
be
made
by
the
agency
whose
mission
is
the
defense
of
the
nation,
and
not
the
agency
whose
mission
is
protecting
civil
servants.
because
in
the
final
analysis,
we
would
rather
exclude
from
our
nuclear
submarines
some
individuals
who
will
never
compromise
sensitive
information
than
admit
one
individual
who
does.
in
particular,
denial
of
a
security
clearance
may
well
be
warranted
when
predicate
facts
are
less
than
probable.
if
an
investigation
leaves
the
navy
with
an
irreducible
suspicion
that
an
employee
has
committed
acts
whose
repetition
would
endanger
security,
common
sense
as
well
as
presidential
command
may
require
denying
him
a
clearance.
the
mspb
presiding
officer's
statement
in
this
case
that
if
the
underlying
facts
are
in
doubt,
the
navy
will
be
required
to
prove
them
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is
quite
wrong
and
very
illuminating.
the
statutory
preponderance
standard
is
the
right
standard
for
testing
a
removal
based
on
an
employee's
alleged
misconduct.
but
it
is
not
the
right
standard
for
judging
whether
there
is
enough
confidence
in
an
individual
to
allow
him
on
board
a
nuclear
submarine.
congress
did
not
give
the
mspb
any
other
standard,
because
it
did
not
think
reviewing
security
clearance
determinations
on
their
merits
is
what
the
mspb
would
be
doing.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
security
clearance
process
is
not
an
attempt
to
judge
an
individual's
past
conduct,
but
to
predict
his
future
behavior.
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
mr.
egan
has
done
something
to
deserve
being
barred
from
working
at
bremerton,
but
whether
there
is
an
unacceptable
risk
that
he
would
compromise
sensitive
information
either
deliberately
or
inadvertently
or
under
compulsion
for
some
reason.
that
is
a
judgment
that
can
only
be
made
by
people
who
are
expert
in
the
aspects
of
human
behavior
that
render
individuals
vulnerable
to
espionage.
finally,
the
security
clearance
determination
can
only
be
made
by
people
who
themselves
have
thorough
going
access
at
least
in
some
cases
can
only
be
made
by
people
who
themselves
have
thorough
going
access
to
classified
information.
to
decide
whether
a
particular
individual
should
be
cleared
for
access
to
work
at
a
particular
place,
he
may
have
to
know
something
about
the
information
to
which
that
job
would
give
him
access.
the
degree
of
sensitivity
of
particular
information,
the
nature
of
its
usefulness
to
hostile
entities,
the
identities
of
the
hostile
entities
to
which
it
may
be
useful
may
have
a
bearing
on
a
particular
clearance
determination.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
they
could
proceed
under
5
u.s.c.
7532.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
and
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
decision
here
in
part
on
the
existence
of
that
section.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
if
they
did
proceed
under
that
section.
that
section,
which
i
do
want
to
talk
about,
gives
the
secretary
of
the
navy
and
other
agency
heads
the
power
to
summarily
suspend
without
pay
any
employee
when
necessary
in
the
interests
of
national
security.
and
then
after
giving
the
employee
the
reasons,
"as
specifically
as
security
considerations
permit.
"
giving
him
some
kind
of
an
intra
agency
hearing
after
which
he
may
be
removed
and
the
removal
is
expressly
excluded
from
any
mspb
review
even
of
process.
i
think
we
want
to
say
two
things
about
that.
we
think
it
has
little
or
no
bearing
on
the
present
issue
first
because
it's
clear
that
an
employee
who
does
not
obtain
a
security
clearance
that
is
a
valid
requirement
of
his
job
can
be
removed
for
cause,
like
an
employee
who
fails
to
meet
any
other
requirement
without
invoking
7532.
essentially,
everyone
involved
in
this
case
agrees
on
that,
although
our
papers
note
that
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
later
disagreed
in
a
different
case.
but
the
existence
of
7532
has
nothing
to
do,
we
think,
with
whether
congress
has
authorized
msbp
review
of
the
merits
of
security
clearance
determinations
in
cases
where
that
emergency
section
is
not
invoked.
7532
does
expressly
provide
for
some
kind
of
a
hearing
by
the
employing
agency,
and
in
non-7532
cases
where
the
adequacy
of
the
agency
process
is
put
at
issue,
i
suppose
7532
might
have
some
bearing
by
way
of
analogy
on
that
question
of
employing
agency
process.
but
it
does
not,
it
seems
to
me,
suggest
that
the
mspb
should
in
such
a
case
take
it
on
itself
to
review
the
merits
of
the
agency's
clearance
organization.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
they
could
have
been
invoked.
this
was
a
new
hire,
an
employee
who
was
put
through
the
agency's
routine
security
clearance
process
for
somebody
who
is
going
to
have
a
laborer's
job
on
board
a
submarine.
and
when
the
result
of
that
clearance
process
was
negative,
there
was
a
removal,
and
the
agency
notified
mr.
egan
that
he
was
entitled
to
mspb
review.
which
we
think
is
an
important
right
on
his
part.
it
would
have
been
possible,
i
think,
but
not
the
use
for
which
7532
was
intended,
for
mr.
egan
to
have
been
suspended
without
pay
at
the
first
sign
that
there
might
be
a
security
question
here,
and
then--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes.
and
that
the
head
of
the
agency,
the
secretary
of
the
navy,
would
then
have
had
to
rule
personally
on
this
case.
and
if
he
had
done
so,
there
would
have
been
no
mspb
review
whatever.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
navy
had
anything
in
particular
that
it
wished
to
conceal,
or
it
could
have
invoked
7532
and
escaped
mspb
review
entirely.
but
it
had
no
reason
to
invoke
that
procedure
here.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
he
loses
his
job
effectively.
he
loses
his
pay
immediately.
and
he
loses
the
right
to
mspb
review
of
his
ultimate
removal,
and
he
may
lose
the
right
to
the
full
statement
of
the
reasons
for
the
denial
of
his
security
clearance
that
mr.
egan
got
here,
and
the
full
statement
of
the
reasons
for
his
removal
that
mr.
egan
got
here,
and
the
opportunity
to
make
a
written
response
in
two
stages.
he
loses
that
whole
process.
he
is
given
after
suspension
and
before
removal
in
what
is
really
quite
a
different
process
under
7532,
a
statement
of
reasons
which
as
i
said
the
statute
says
is
to
be
as
detailed
as
security
considerations
permit.
and
then
a
hearing
before
an
agency
board
and
then
a
final
determination
by
the
head
of
the
agency.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it
would.
7532
would
certainly
protect
the
government's
concerns
for
secrecy
in
a
case
where
it
doesn't
want
to
tell
the
employee
or
the
mspb
all
of
the
reasons
for
its
concerns.
it
would
not
protect
the
government's
concern
to
give
the
employee
the
kind
of
opportunity
to
respond
and
the
kind
of
opportunity
for
an
mspb
check
on
its
procedures
that
respondent
had
here.
it
also
would
involve
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
making
personnel
decisions
about
whether
a
laborer
who
is
going
to
work
in
a
facility
where
the
only
reason
for
not
letting
him
work
was
because
of
the
information
with
which
he
would
come
into
contact--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
the
court
assumed
in
coal
v.
young
that
there
is
no
judicial
review
and
i
think
that
would
be
our
position.
i
suspect
we
would
get
some
debate.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
on
7532.
but
that
is
our
position.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
that's
right.
but
the
navy's
judgment
that
particular
evidence
warrants
denial
of
a
clearance
is
and
ought
to
be
final.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
