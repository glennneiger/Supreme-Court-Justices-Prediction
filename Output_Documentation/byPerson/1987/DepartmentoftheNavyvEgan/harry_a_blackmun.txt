justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
this
case
comes
to
us
by
a
way
of
certiorari
to
the
federal
circuit
and
title
v
of
the
united
states
code
provides
a
two-track
system
for
undertaking
an
adverse
action
so-called
against
certain
government
employees.
under
one
statute
an
employee
who
is
removed
for
cause
has
a
right
of
appeal
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board
and
that
right
includes
a
hearing.
under
another
statute
an
employee
is
subject
to
summary
reversal
based
on
national
security
concerns
and
that
removal
is
not
appealable
to
the
board
but
the
employee
has
specified
procedural
rights
including
a
hearing
by
in
the
agency
authority.
the
respondent,
mr.
egan
was
removed
from
his
labors
job
at
the
submarine
facility.
after
that
navy
denied
him
the
required
security
clearance.
without
that
clearance
he
was
not
eligible
for
any
job
with
the
facility
because
all
jobs
there
required
a
clearance.
he
appealed
to
the
board.
it
sustained
the
removal
action.
the
federal
circuit
reversed
holding
that
review
of
the
merits
of
the
underlying
security
clearance
was
in
order.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
the
board,
under
the
statute
utilized,
does
not
have
the
authority
to
review
the
substance
of
underlying
security
clearance
determination.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
justices
brennan
and
marshall,
and
justice
kennedy
again
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
