chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
on
number
86-1552,
department
of
the
navy
versus
egan.
mr.
cohen,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
didn't
the
board
mention
its
deference
to
disbarment
proceedings
and
criminal
convictions
in
its
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cohen.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
nold.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
a
case
where
the
only
requirement
is
that
he
be
admitted
to
the
bar,
and
they
show
that
he's
been
disbarred.
do
you
think
the
board
has
a
right
to
inquire
into
the
propriety
of
his
disbarment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
why
should
you
treat
the
navy
department's
security
clearance
system
as
so
totally
different
from
the
state
requirements
for
admission
and
remaining
in
the
bar?
i
mean,
it's
a
separate
organization,
and
you
don't
have
any
claim
here
that
your
client
was
denied
due
process
in
the
security
denial,
do
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
didn't
ask
for
a
hearing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
supposing
that
a
particular
job
in
the
navy
calls
for
someone
of
field
grade
say
of
lieutenant
commander,
and
this
fellow
was
a
lieutenant
commander
but
he's
reduced
in
rank
to
a
lieutenant,
and
therefore
the
civilian
side
of
the
navy
says,
well,
you
no
longer
have
the
qualification
to
fill
this
job.
now,
do
you
think
the
merit
system
protection
board
can
review
whether
or
not
he
was
properly
demoted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
there
are
some
kinds
of
decisions,
then...
collateral,
as
you
call
them...
that
the
merit
system
protection
board
shouldn't
review?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
why
should
the
denial
of
a
security
clearance
be
one
of
them?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
is
that
different
from
the
fellow
who's
demoted
from
lieutenant
commander
to
lieutenant?
it's
the
navy
doing
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
secretary
of
the
navy
is
head
of
them
both.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nold.
mr.
cohen,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-1552,
department
of
the
navy
versus
egan
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
