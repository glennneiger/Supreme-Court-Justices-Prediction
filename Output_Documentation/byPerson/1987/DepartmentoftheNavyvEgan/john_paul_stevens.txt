mr.
cohen,
can
i
just
ask
one
kind
of
general
question.
does
your
argument
apply
equally
to
a
removal
from
a
position
to
a
person
who
previously
obtained
a
security
clearance
but
had
his
security
clearance
revoked?
is
there
any
difference,
do
you
think?
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
isn't
there
another
difference,
too.
isn't
under
7513
at
the
end
of
the
line,
there's
judicial
review,
is
there
not,
whereas
under
7532,
there's
not?
or
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
stevens
on
7532.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
there
is
a
hearing
before
the
department
of
the
navy.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
require
it,
but
didn't
they
offer
your
client
a
hearing?
justice
stevens
well,
and
it
was
before
the
agency
which
is
exactly
what
7532
would
have
given
you
a
right
to
have.
justice
stevens
didn't
they
give
him
a
statement
of
reasons?
justice
stevens
an
opportunity
to
question
any
of
the
facts
that
they
set
forth?
justice
stevens
even
if
you
question
the
facts?
justice
stevens
and
here
he
didn't
ask
for
one.
is
that
right?
