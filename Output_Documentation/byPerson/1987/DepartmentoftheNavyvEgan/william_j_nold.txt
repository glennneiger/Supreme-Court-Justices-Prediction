mr.
william
j.
nold
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
listening
to
the
arguments
presented
by
the
navy
in
this
case,
i've
tried
to
come
up
with
a
way
that
i
could
possibly
describe
them.
and
i
think
that
we
start
out
with
the
same
premise.
we
start
out
with
the
premise
that
this
is
a
case
that
involves
statutory
interpretation.
it's
at
that
point
that
the
government
seems
to
walk
away
from
that
question.
what
they
seem
to
do
in
my
view
is
to
start
building
a
cloud
around
the
statute.
they
start
building
this
cloud
and
they
call
it
national
security,
and
as
their
argument
progresses
down
through
their
argument
in
their
brief,
the
cloud
gets
darker
and
darker
and
darker,
so
that
by
the
time
we
get
to
the
end,
we
can't
see
the
statute
anymore.
what
we
see
is
this
cloud
called
national
security.
i
am
not
here
to
argue
that
national
security
is
not
important.
i
am
not
here
to
take
a
position
in
this
case
that
would
limit
agencies'
ability
to
maintain
and
protect
national
security.
that's
obviously
something
that
they've
been
told
to
do
by
the
president,
and
we
want
them
to
do
it.
but
what
i
want
to
do
is
to
look
at
this
statute
aside
and
apart
from
this
cloud
for
just
a
moment,
and
see
what
it
says.
not
only
what
the
particular
statute
says
that
talks
about
removal
for
cause...
7513...
but
also
the
statute
that
says
you
can
remove
somebody
on
the
basis
of
national
security.
i
may
even
take
a
look
at
the
statute
that
says
that
you
can
remove
someone
because
of
poor
performance.
because
the
civil
service
reform
act
created
a
lot
of
new
things
that
the
civil
service
commission
under
the
old
system
didn't
have.
it
created
an
independent
board,
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
that
was
to
hear
these
cases
separate
and
apart
from
agencies.
now,
when
they
did
that,
i
believe
that
congress
was
the
proper
body
to
take
a
look
at
this
cloud
that's
there
or
take
a
look
at
this
problem
of
national
security,
take
a
look
at
this
situation
where
the
president
has
told
agencies
to
make
sure
you
don't
compromise
security,
and
come
up
with
a
statutory
scheme
that
would
not
only
protect
the
interest
of
the
employee,
but
also
protect
the
interest
of
agencies
in
a
situation
such
as
we
have
here.
and
i
believe
that
they
did
that.
and
i
would
like
to
talk
about
these
particular
statutes
for
just
a
moment.
7513
is
the
statute
that
contains
the
language
that
we've
heard
for
years:
you
can't
remove
an
employee
unless
it's
for
cause
that
would
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
there
is
another
statute,
chapter
43
of
the
act...
4303,
i
believe,
that
says
now
under
the
new
law
that
you
can
remove
an
employee
for
performance
reasons.
you
don't
have
to
show
cause.
you
just
have
to
show
that
he
hasn't
performed
up
to
the
level
that
he's
expected
to
perform.
now,
taking
those
two
statutes
for
a
minute,
the
courts
have
held
that
an
agency
can
terminate
an
employee
on
performance-based
reasons
under
chapter
7513,
that
is,
for
cause,
because
there
might
be
situations
where
performance
and
cause
kind
of
go
together.
but
the
cases
have
said
that
if
you
do
that,
you
are
bound
by
the
procedures,
you
are
bound
by
the
burdens
of
proof,
you
are
bound
by
all
of
the
other
rights
that
the
employee
has
under
7513.
you're
not
bound
under
the
precise
procedural
problems
that
are
presented
under
performance
based
types
of
claims.
now,
let
me
throw
into
the
statutory
scheme,
7532.
it
wasn't
created
by
the
civil
service
reform
act.
it's
been
around
for
years.
and
what
that
says
is,
and
what
that
recognizes
is
is
that
under
some
circumstances,
there
may
be
situations
when
agencies
ought
to
be
able
to
terminate
somebody
and
not
have
somebody
else
essentially
looking
over
their
shoulder
and
second
guessing
that
move.
mr.
william
j.
nold
justice
scalia,
another
explanation
of
it
could
mean
that
the
congress
in
the
legislative
history
under
7532
recognized
that
there
might
be
situations
where
an
employee
would
have
to
be
removed
and
taken
out
of
the
government,
not
because
of
any
fault
of
his
own
whatsoever.
maybe
a
russian
agent
moved
in
next
door
to
him.
certainly,
that's
not
his
fault.
but
it
may
be
in
the
interests
of
national
security
that
he
not
live
next
door
to
a
russian
agent.
so
they
have
the
ability
to
remove
him,
even
though
there's
no
cause
whatsoever
from
the
standpoint
of
misconduct
on
his
part.
mr.
william
j.
nold
that's
right.
and
in
some
cases,
security
clearances
like
you
say
are
revoked
or
denied
because
of
misconduct
types
of
reasons,
and
sometimes
not.
you
asked
earlier
a
question
about
what
the
employee
loses
when
7532
is
invoked.
there
is
something
of
a
very
real
importance
that
the
employee
gains.
because
what
he
gains
is
the
right
to
a
hearing.
under
the
procedures
that
the
msbp
felt
that
were
appropriate
to
review
these
kinds
of
cases,
the
situation
could
be
that
the
person
never
gets
the
opportunity
to
sit
down
and
cross
examine
and
confront
the
people
that
say
that
he's
done
x,
y
and
z.
he's
totally
denied
that
right.
at
least
under
7532,
he
would
have
the
opportunity'
to
have
some
form
of
hearing,
even
though
that
hearing
would
be
in
front
of
the
agency.
mr.
william
j.
nold
well,
the
wording's
the
same.
mr.
william
j.
nold
no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
under
7532,
the
statute
says
that
he
has
the
right
to
a
hearing.
under
7513,
the
statute
also
says
that
he
has
a
right
to
be
heard
before
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
and
this
board
is
directed
by
the
statutes
to
hear
and
adjudicate
the
matters
that
come
before
it.
now,
under
the
scheme
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
merit
systems
protection
board
and
found
offensive
by
the
federal
circuit,
there
would
be
no
hearing
at
all,
in
my
view,
in
front
of
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
and
the
reason
is
because
there
wouldn't
be
anything
to
hear.
mr.
william
j.
nold
not
under
7513.
mr.
william
j.
nold
they
did.
mr.
william
j.
nold
no,
they
didn't
offer
him
a
hearing
in
the
revocation
or
the
denial
process
of
the
security
clearance.
mr.
william
j.
nold
statement
of
reasons.
mr.
william
j.
nold
you
get
a
written
statement
of
reasons.
you
get
an
opportunity
to
provide
a
written
response,
and
you
get
a
decision.
and
you
get
the
right
to
appeal
one
higher
level
within
the
agency.
that's
it.
you
don't
get
the
right
to
be
heard.
mr.
william
j.
nold
even...
there
is
no
provision
that
i'm
aware
of
that
he
could
command
a
hearing.
whether
the
agency
would
give
him
one,
i
guess
there
would
be
some
discretion
of
their
part.
mr.
william
j.
nold
he
did
not
ask
for
one.
mr.
william
j.
nold
after
suspension
and
prior
to
removal.
mr.
william
j.
nold
a
pre-termination
hearing.
the
merit
systems
protection
board
again,
as
i've
mentioned,
has
the
mandate
to
hear
and
adjudicate
the
matters
that
come
before
it.
and
there's
no
question
that
this
matter
was
properly
before
it.
now,
in
addition
to
having
the
merit
systems
protection
board
hear
the
matter,
he's
entitled
to
judicial
review
to
the
federal
circuit
upon
a
decision
by
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
and
the
scope
of
review
was
defined
specifically
in
the
civil
service
reform
act.
and
it's
very
similar,
i
believe,
to
the
kind
of
review
that
you
would
get
under
the
administrative
procedures
act.
it's
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
and
the
courts
look
to
see
whether
or
not
the
law
was
followed
and
whether
or
not
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
decision.
now,
i'm
trying
to
imagine
what
the
court
would
be
looking
at
in
a
case
where
the
only
questions
were:
does
he
or
does
he
not
have
a
clearance,
was
the
clearance
required
as
a
part
of
his
job,
and
were
minimal
due
process
standards
granted.
that
could
all
be
put
on
one
page.
mr.
william
j.
nold
absolutely
not.
and
the
reason
that
they
don't
is
that
the
supreme
courts
of
our
states
have
very
elaborate
rules
that
have
considerable
due
process
rights
built
into
them,
and
there
would
be
no
way
that
the
merit
systems
protection
board
would
have
any
control
whatsoever
over
that.
mr.
william
j.
nold
well,
i
think--
mr.
william
j.
nold
--let
me
answer
the
first
question,
first.
i
think
the
distinction
that
has
to
be
drawn
between
a
disbarment
proceeding
or
in
the
military
context,
the
questions
come
up
when
a
person
doesn't
get
a
promotion
in
the
military.
the
distinction
there
is
it's
a
collateral
source.
the
person
that
is
taking
away
the
right
to
practice
law
is
totally
different
from
the
navy
in
this
case
who's
firing
somebody.
mr.
william
j.
nold
no,
i
absolutely
do
not.
mr.
william
j.
nold
that's
true.
mr.
william
j.
nold
because
it's
one
and
the
same
person
that's
doing
the
removal.
it's
the
civilian
side
of
the
navy
that's
taking
away
the
security
clearance.
it's
the
civilian
side
of
the
navy
that's
terminating
him.
mr.
william
j.
nold
well,
because
the
navy
does
have
military
on
one
side
and
civilian
on
the
other.
this
security
clearance--
mr.
william
j.
nold
--the
security
clearance
is
revoked
by
the
naval
civilian
personnel
command.
there
are
certainly
important
things
to
be
said
for
the
military
not
having
restraint
on
it.
mr.
william
j.
nold
well,
it
is
in
another
division
at
this
time.
but
the
agency--
mr.
william
j.
nold
--well,
the
interest
that's
being
protected
when
you're
talking
about
a
military
decision
is
the
same
interest
that
you
want
to
protect
to
make
sure
that
everybody
in
the
platoon
is
marching
in
the
same
direction.
and
that's
not
what
we
have
in
this
national
security
question
matter.
you've
got
to
have
absolute
control
in
the
military.
mr.
william
j.
nold
substantial
evidence,
right.
mr.
william
j.
nold
well,
the
congress
wanted
to
give
the
ability
to
fire
people.
mr.
william
j.
nold
i
think
it
should
be
removed
even
a
step
further,
and
under
chapter
7532,
because
that's
the
same
test.
that
talks
about
things
where
continued
employment
is
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
national
security.
it's
the
same
test
as
you
have
with
the
revocation
of
the
clearance
itself.
that
is
my
point.
what
the
navy
has
done
in
this
case
is
that
they've
really
changed
the
standard
under
7513.
they've
changed
the
standard
from
one
of
being
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
national
security
to
replace
the
standard
that
says
you
can't
fire
somebody
unless
it's
for
such
cause
as
would
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
so
by
a
two-step
process,
they
have
changed
the
standard
under
7513.
because
that
is
precisely
the
same
standard
as
you
have
in
the
revocation
of
the
security
clearance.
mr.
william
j.
nold
well,
justice
scalia,
when
he
was
a
judge,
i
believe,
wrote
an
opinion
about
that
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
william
j.
nold
they
tell
us
we're
supposed
to
call
you
justices.
and
you
examined
that
whether
or
not
a
due
process
interest
attached
to
a
security
clearance,
and
i
believe...
or
a
liberty
interest
attached
to
a
security
clearance...
and
the
holding
was
that
it
did
not
attach
when
you
didn't
get
the
clearance
because
of
some
unspecified
reason.
but
in
this
case,
mr.
egan
is
having
his
clearance
taken
away
for
very
specified
reasons
that
have
been
set
out
and
that
appear
to
me
to
constitute
misconduct,
which
then
is
bootstrapped,
if
you
will,
over
into
a
removal
action
which
this
court
has
consistently
held
an
employee
of
his
status
has
a
property
right
in
his
job,
under
arnett
v.
kennedy
and
those
other
cases
that
talk
about
that.
so
i
believe
that
what
the
decision
does
in
the
mspb
is
to
convert
that
standard
from
7532
and
cause
it
to
be
enforced
under
7513.
clearly,
congress
did
not
intend
to
do
that.
i
think
what
they
intended
when
they
talked
about
as
such
cause
as
would
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service,
was
to
give
the
employee
who
was
told
that
he
was
going
to
be
fired
and
specific
reasons
for
his
termination,
to
give
the
employee
the
opportunity
to
cross
examine
the
person
or
the
witnesses
that
would
testify
against
him,
and
possibly
correct
a
situation
that
might
be
wrong.
he
can't
do
that
under
the
system
that
is
advanced
by
the
navy
in
this
case.
and
i
believe
that
that
was
what
was
found
objectionable
by
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
william
j.
nold
well,
certainly
under
the
foia,
the
courts
even
now
give
a
great
deal
of
due
deference
to--
mr.
william
j.
nold
--i
want
the
mspb
to
look
into
the
reasons
that
were
advanced
for
the
revocation
of
that
clearance.
if
misconduct
was
involved.
that's
what
i
want.
and
i
want
him
to
have
the
ability
to
create
a
record
about
that.
and
i
want
him
to
have
the
ability
to
have
judicial
review
of
that
record
so
that
some
court
can
later
look
back
and
say
whether
or
not
he
was
denied
something
arbitrarily
or
capriciously.
mr.
william
j.
nold
the
navy
takes
the
position
that
no
judicial
review
would
be
available.
i
don't
know
that
that's
ever
been
really
tested
or
not
one
way
or
the
other.
certainly,
the
statute
does
not
preclude
judicial
review.
mr.
william
j.
nold
well,
i
think
the
agency
was
thinking,
well,
the
guy
doesn't
have
a
clearance.
that's
one
of
the
qualifications
for
his
position,
and
therefore
that
constitutes
cause
for
removal.
i
don't
think
they
did
it
to
avoid
the
process.
mr.
william
j.
nold
well,
maybe
they
did.
but
they
do
have
the
option,
certainly,
and
they
chose
which
way
to
go.
egan
had
no
ability
to
make
that
choice.
they
chose
to
go
the
route
7532,
which
entitles
him
to
all
those
procedures
and
the
hearing
that
he
gets.
i
believe
that
with
the
questions
we've
covered,
it
pretty
much
covers
what
i
wanted
to
say.
thank
you.
