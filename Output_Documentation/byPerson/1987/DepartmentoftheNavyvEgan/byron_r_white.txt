justice
white
do
you
suggest
that
that
reading
of
the
statute
should
go
right
across
the
board
to
any
kind
of
a
removal
or
just
to
any
adverse
action?
justice
white
well,
does
this
construction
apply
to
anything
but
security
clearances?
justice
white
of
course,
construing
1712
and
1713
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
wouldn't
really
keep
the
agency
from
insulating
security
cancellations
from
judicial
review.
they
could
proceed
another
way,
couldn't
they?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
but
my
question
is,
you'll
admit
the
agency's
interests
could
be
protected
if
they
proceeded
under
that
section?
justice
white
why
did
the
agency
proceed
under
1712
and
13
rather
than
1732
in
this
case,
or
why
would
it
in
other
cases
like
this?
justice
white
or
later,
when
there
was.
justice
white
so
your
position
is
there's
no
judicial
review
of
the
merits
of
the
security
removal
under
1713?
justice
white
under
7532
after
suspension,
he
can
get
a
hearing?
justice
white
right,
he
can
get
a
hearing.
justice
white
yes,
but
that
assumes
the
security
decision
is
subject
to
review.
justice
white
he's
still
a
judge.
we
think
he
still
is
a
judge.
thanks,
fellas.
justice
white
i
suppose
then
you
would
rather
have
the
navy
proceed
under
1713,
if
it's
construed
as
you
would
have
it,
than
under
1732,
because
you
would
have
no
judicial
review
under
1732
but
you
would
have
an
agency
hearing.
justice
white
in
your
mind,
why
do
you
think
the
navy
proceeded
under
1713
rather
than
1732,
to
avoid
an
agency
hearing
of
the
kind
that
he
would
get
in
1732?
justice
white
you
don't
think
they
made
a
mistake
about
what
1713
means?
