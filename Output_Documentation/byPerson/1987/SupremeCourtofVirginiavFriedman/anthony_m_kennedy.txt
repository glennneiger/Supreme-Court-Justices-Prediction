justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
first
case
to
announce
is
supreme
court
of
virginia
versus
friedman.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
from
the
fourth
circuit.
under
the
applicable
rules
in
virginia,
qualified
lawyers
admitted
to
practice
in
another
state
may
be
admitted
to
the
virginia
bar
on
motion.
this
means
that
these
attorneys
may
be
admitted
to
the
bar
without
taking
the
bar
examination
that
virginia
otherwise
requires.
the
state
conditions
this
type
of
admission
on
the
showing
among
other
matters
that
the
applicant
be
a
permanent
resident
of
virginia.
myrna
friedman
had
been
admitted
to
the
illinois
bar
by
examination
in
1977
and
later
was
admitted
to
the
district
of
columbia
bar
by
reciprocity.
after
living
in
virginia
for
several
years,
she
became
an
attorney
for
a
company
with
full-time
offices
in
vienna,
virginia.
this
was
in
1986.
a
short
time
later,
she
moved
to
maryland
with
her
husband
while
retaining
her
legal
counsel
employment
in
virginia.
because
she
was
not
a
full-time
resident
of
virginia,
her
application
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar
on
motion
was
denied.
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
ruled
that
this
residence
requirement
violated
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
article
iv
of
the
constitution.
we
agree
and
we
now
affirm.
in
examining
whether
a
citizenship
or
residency
classification
offends
privileges
and
immunities
protections,
we
undertake
a
well-settled
two-step
inquiry.
first,
we
determine
whether
the
activity
in
which
the
classification
applies
is
basic
to
the
vitality
of
the
nation,
merits
protection
and
of
the
privileges
of
the
immunities
clause.
we
answer
this
question
in
the
affirmative
in
the
present
case
because
our
decision
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
versus
piper,
the
case
decided
three
years
ago,
established
that
a
nonresident's
right
to
practice
law
on
terms
of
substantially
equality
with
residents
is
a
privilege
protected
by
the
clause.
we
reject
virginia's
contention
so
long
as
an
applicant
has
the
alternative
of
gaining
admission
to
a
state's
bar,
without
regard
to
residence
by
passing
the
bar
examination,
the
state
has
not
discriminated
against
nonresidents
on
a
matter
of
fundamental
concern.
the
second
step
of
the
inquiry
set
out
and
our
precedents
recognizes
that
the
disparity
of
treatment
is
permissible.
when
a
state
demonstrates
that
the
discrimination
against
nonresidents
bears
a
close
relation
to
the
achievement
of
substantial
state
objectives.
as
set
forth
in
the
opinion
we
filed
today,
we
conclude
that
virginia
has
failed
to
make
the
showing.
we
are
not
persuaded
by
the
state's
argument
that
the
residency
requirement
is
needed
to
ensure
that
attorney
submitted
on
motion
will
be
as
familiar
with
local
law
and
has
committed
to
the
virginia
bar
as
our
attorney
submitted
upon
examination.
we
acknowledge
that
the
bar
examination
is
one
method
of
assuring
that
the
admitted
attorney
has
a
stake
in
her
professional
licensure
and
a
concomitant
interest
in
the
integrity
and
standards
of
the
bar.
a
bar
examination
is,
we
know
judicially
and
from
our
own
experience,
is
not
a
casual
or
lighthearted
exercise.
the
question,
however,
is
whether
lawyers
who
are
admitted
in
other
states
and
seek
admission
in
virginia
are
less
likely
to
respect
the
bar
and
further
its
interests
solely
because
they
are
nonresidents.
we
cannot
say
this
is
the
case.
the
chief
justices
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
joins.
