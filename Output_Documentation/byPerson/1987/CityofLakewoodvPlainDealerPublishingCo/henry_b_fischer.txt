mr.
henry
b.
fischer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
an
ordinance
of
the
city
of
lakewood
that
gives
the
mayor
contract
authority
to
rent
the
city's
treeline
property
for
the
placement
of
news
boxes.
there
are
three
issues
that
i
would
like
to
relate
before
the
court
today.
the
three
are
jurisdiction,
discretion,
and
insurance.
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
which
was
pointed
out
at
page
43
of
the
brief,
whether
the
discretion
given
by
the
ordinance
to
the
mayor
and
the
architect
review
board
are
so
uncontrolled
as
to
be
unconstitutional,
and
the
constitutionality
of
the
insurance
requirement.
we
will
attempt
to
demonstrate
the
plain
dealer
did
not
apply
for
a
permit,
did
not
exhaust
its
administrative
remedies
and
appeals,
and
did
not
properly
test
the
ordinance
to
assert
the
issues
before
the
court
to
permit
passing
on
the
merits
of
the
ordinance.
we
will
try
to
demonstrate
that
the
discretion
is
not
uncontrolled,
and
that
the
insurance
requirement,
being
content
neutral
and
otherwise
reasonable,
is
constitutional.
factually,
the
original
lakewood
ordinance
banned
all
structures,
not
just
news
boxes,
all
structures
on
the
city
property.
lakewood
did
not
appeal.
they
wanted
to
permit
the
plain
dealer
to
put
their
news
boxes
in.
and
they
amended
their
ordinances
twice
to
accommodate
the
plain
dealer's
placement
of
news
boxes
along
the
streets.
the
record
shows
that
had
the
plain
dealer
applied,
they
would
have
secured
the
spaces
they
desired.
the
city
engineer
so
testified,
and
the
court
also
found
so.
there
would
have
been
no
discretion
of
the
mayor
to
have
been
applied
and
they
could
have
had
the
news
boxes
installed
since
1984.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
discretion
for
the
mayor
to
exercise
if
they
had
applied,
because
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
where
they
wanted
to
place
their
news
boxes.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
to
rent
the
property.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
it
was
subject
to
his
determination.
it
is
right
in
the
ordinance.
if
the
location
was
not
causing
a
health
or
safety
hazard...
it
is
written
right
in
the
ordinance.
if
it
is
not
a
health
or
safety
hazard.
also,
if
it
is
not
causing
a
nuisance
or
not
unduly
interfering
with
the
rights
of
the
traffic,
that
the
location
would
be
all
right.
those
were
the
standards
that
were
set
up--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--that's
right.
he
was
prepared
to
issue
the
permit.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
yes,
starting
with
finding
16.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
it
said
that
the
city
was
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
issue
the
permits
had
they
applied
but
the
plain
dealer
had
not
applied
for
the
permits.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
well,
the
district
court
found
the
ordinance
to
be
constitutional
all
the
way
down
the
line.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
so
they
found...
the
district
court
obviously
found
that
as
to
everything
before
it
the
mayor
did
not
have
unbridled
discretion,
that
the
discretion
was
appropriate.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
that
the
mayor
did
not
have...
they
found
that
the
discretion
of
the
mayor
was
not
unbridled
and
did
not
find
anything
wrong
with
it.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
that's
correct,
that
he
would
not...
he
could
not
just
deny
it.
if
he
denied
it,
he
had
to
state
his
reasons,
and
there
could
only
be
three
reasons
that
he
could
deny
it.
one
would
be
location,
that
there
was
a
health
and
safety
hazard
caused
by
it.
the
second
reason
that
he
could
deny
would
be
because
it
was
not...
they
could
not
harmonize
it
through
architectural
review.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
necessary
and
reasonable?
this,
we
are
talking
about
contract
authority,
and
just
like
many
other
contracts
that
have
come
before
this
court,
the
legislative
authority
gives
an
individual
authority
to
make
contracts
within
certain
guidelines.
it
gives
them
discretion
for
the
nuts
and
bolts
details.
the
nuts
and
bolts
detail
in
this
particular
case
could
be
what
if
the
city
had
to
do
some
repairs
on
the
sidewalk
or
whatever?
they
would
want
to
make
some
arrangements
for
the
plain
dealer
to
move
their
news
box
during
that
particular
time.
so
that
is
the
necessary
and
reasonable
type
of
regulations
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
that's
correct,
and
our
position
is
that
that
is
one
of
the
things
we
are
here
to--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--if
you
get
to
that
beyond
the
jurisdiction,
because
we
start
with
jurisdiction,
and
our
contention
is
and
has
been,
because
of
the
appeal
procedure
that
we
have
established,
they
should
have
applied
for
their
permit
first,
and
if
they
didn't
like
the
conditions,
which
i
submit
to
you
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
they
wouldn't
have
liked
them,
i
think
they
would
have
had
their
news
boxes
out
there
since
1984,
there
would
have
been
no
problem.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
yes,
you
can
find
it
at
page
31
of
our
brief
and
essentially
we
cited
the
case
of
greer
versus
spock,
that
they
should
have...
that
the
thing
was
not
ripe
for
testing.
we
also
asserted
a
defense
in
the
district
court
that
they
had
this
administrative
remedy
and
that
they
should
have
asserted
it.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
yes.
the
brief
on
the
merits.
is
it
43?
excuse
me,
it
is
43.
i'm
sorry,
page
43
in
our
brief.
the
ordinance
was
written,
i
can
tell
you
from
firsthand
because
i
wrote
it,
the
ordinance
was
written
so
that
the
city
of
lakewood
could
permit
them
to
place
their
news
boxes
without
interfering
with
the
constitutional
rights
of
other
persons,
e.g.,
lovell,
schneider,
other
people
that
would
want
to
use
that
property
but
couldn't,
and
the
reason
that
they
couldn't
was
because
the
plain
dealer
wanted
to
use
it
exclusively.
we
used
the
rental
theory
to
overcome
that.
yes?
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
it
is
page
43.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
yes.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
pardon?
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
gannett
and
also
we
led
up
to
that
with
greer
versus
spock
on
page
41...
or
42.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
so
pd
did
not
apply.
instead,
they
sued
to
attack
the
ordinances
instead,
and
i
think
the
essence
is
that
they
want
free,
uninhabited
use
of
the
city
property.
that
is
where
they
are
coming
from.
so,
as
to
jurisdiction,
as
i
indicated,
the
city
had
drafted
this
ordinance
with
the
attempt
to
permit,
not
to
play
games
with
the
plain
dealer.
we
wrote
this
ordinance
so
that
the
plain
dealer
could
place
their
news
boxes,
and
we
felt
the
appropriate
theory
for
allowing
this
was
a
rental
theory.
and
you
could
find
in
the
finding
16
of
the
court
and
i
think
it
is
page
a30
of
the
jurisdictional
statements
where
that
finding
is,
that
they
would
have
been
able
to
get
these
news
box
locations,
but
instead
they
choose
to
attack
the
whole
thing.
the
district
court
would
not
receive
any
evidence
of
administrative
interpretation.
we
offered
the
testimony
of
the
mayor
who
actually
requested
the
legislation
to
settle
the
lawsuit.
the
district
court,
however,
would
not
allow
us
to
use
that
testimony
as
to
what
was
intended.
there
are
no
applications.
there
is
no
real
justiciable
issue.
it
is
not
ripe
because
they
did
not
apply
it.
now,
as
to
the
standards--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--i
believe...
i
hate
to
compare
cases,
but
i
believe
that
we
have
set
out
far
more
guidelines
than
the
gannett
case
or
the
greer
versus
spock
case.
we
have
limited
discretion
tremendously
compared
to
those.
i
don't
think
the
statement
could
even
be
made.
i
hope
i
have
answered
your
question
on
that.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
pardon?
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
i
am
disagreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
right,
not
the
district
court.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
we
have
the
provisions
right
in
the
ordinance
as
to,
you
can't
make
it
any
different
height,
you
can't
make
it
any
different
size,
you
can't
put
it
next
to
a
fire
plug.
all
these
things
are
spelled
out.
the
only
thing
that
is
left
for
the
mayor
to
do
is
to
check
to
see
if
architectural
review
was
done,
to
be
sure
that
it
is
a
safe
location,
and
to
put
any
other
conditions...
for
example,
the
condition
to
move
the
box
in
the
case
they
have
to
do
construction.
that
is--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--yes,
we
do.
we
also
believe
that--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--under
jurisdiction
i
don't
believe
they
should
have
even
reached
it.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
that's
correct,
and
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
city
of
lakewood
on
that
part
of
the
ordinance
that
they
could
limit
them
to
the
commercial
districts
only.
they
also
sustained
that
the
rental
charge
could
be
made.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
no,
the
residential
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
as
to
discretion,
the
ordinance
specified--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
i
think
that
these
are
terms
of
art.
i
believe
probably
hundreds
of
contracts
have
come
before
this
court
where
the
legislative
body
gives
authority
to
somebody
to
make
a
contract,
they
don't
spell
out
every
last
term,
and
as
long
as
the
intent
of
the
ordinance,
which
is
to
allow
the
placement
of
the
news
boxes
is
affected,
i
don't
see
where
there
would
be
any
problem.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
that's
correct,
and
it
could
be
only
technical,
minor
things
that
would
be
reasonable
and
necessary,
such
as
the
relocation
of
the
box
in
the
event
of
construction,
as
the
example
that
i
have
cited.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
how
do
you
know
that?
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
such
other
conditions...
it
is
c7,
such
other
conditions
as
may
be
deemed
reasonable
and
necessary
by
the
mayor.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
right.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
i
don't
believe
that
it
does.
i
think
the
intent
of
the
legislature
was
clear
that
they
wanted
the
news
box
rental
to
go
on,
and
it
could
be
only
the
catch-all
type
clauses
that
you
would
throw
into
any
contract
to
effectuate
it,
so
that
the
city
wouldn't
be
hamstrung.
for
example,
with
utility
polls
we
have
a
right
to
ask
them
to
move
it
and
replace
it
during
construction,
and
it
was
anticipated
at
the
time
that
it
was
written
that
it
was
not
going
to
contain
every
last
nut
and
bolt,
that
there
was
going
to
be
something
for
the
mayor.
we
knew
the
plain
dealer
was
going
to
apply,
or
thought
they
would
apply,
at
least,
and
we
knew
that
we
could
handle
those
sites.
we
didn't
know
what
else
was
going
to
come
down
the
line,
and
so
we
left
it
open
so
that
the
mayor
could
protect
the
health
and
safety.
it
is
a
police
power
residual
clause,
just
to
protect
the
property
rights
of
the
city.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
pardon?
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
are
you
talking
about
the
architectural
review
board?
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
i
don't
know
whether
they
have
adopted
them
now.
this
was
shortly
after
the
adoption--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--they
had
not
at
the
time
it
was
filed.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
that's
right,
because
there
had
been
nothing
before
them
to
work
on
so
they
had
not
proceeded
to
that
point.
the
ordinance
specifies
size,
height,
location,
eliminates
considerable
discretion.
the
most
efficient
procedure
is
right
here
as
to
what
we
have.
if
the
mayor
feels
uncomfortable
giving
something
that
somebody
asks
they
appeal
to
the
council.
the
council
has
a
legislative
body
that
gives
the
contract
authority
wants
to
approve
it
that
is
the
end
of
it.
if
they
don't
like
what
the
council
does
with
it,
they
go
to
the
courts.
and
it
is
clear
ohio
law
that
under
chapter
2506,
the
decision
of
that
council
cannot
be
arbitrary,
it
cannot
be
capricious,
it
cannot
be
illegal,
it
cannot
be
unconstitutional,
and
it
cannot
be
unreasonable
or
unsupported
by
evidence.
the
mayor
has
to
say
why
he
does
this
or
that
or
the
other
thing,
and
he
has
to
give
his
reasons.
i
don't
see
what
else
we
could
do
to
make
this
any
better,
and
certainly
it
is
ten
times...
it
is
100
times
better
than
what
you
had
in
greer
versus
spock
and
also
in
the
gannett
case.
as
to
the
mayor,
we
have
the
reasonable
and
necessary
provision
for
relocation,
as
i
indicated,
and
other
things
of
that
nature.
the
reasonable...
we
have
the
location
standard
provided,
whether
the
architecture
review
board
was
done,
the
terms
of
the
lease,
and
then
plus
the
mayor
must
say
if
he
is
going
to
deny
what
the
reasons
are,
and
it
has
to
be
only
for
the
reasons
of
a
health
and
safety
hazard,
or
there
is
a
nuisance,
or
that
they
would
interfere
with
the
traffic.
a
lot
has
been
said
about
censorship
in
this
thing.
these
rental
agreements
are
for
one
year.
now,
during
that
one
year
term
what
is
the
mayor
going
to
do,
wait
until
there
is
an
article
in
the
newspaper
and
come
up
with
some
phony
reason
to
cancel
it?
i
doubt
it.
and
then
when
they
reapply
for
the
next
year,
assuming
that
it
is
profitable
to
them
and
they
want
to
continue
with
it,
how
would
the
mayor
be
able
to
come
up
with
a
good
reason
for
denying
when
it
was
there
the
whole
time?
either
he
has
got
a
good
reason
for
denying
it
or
he
doesn't.
so
i
find
it
very
difficult
as
to
the
censorship
and
i
would
point
out
that
they
would
have
had
their
permits
if
they
had
applied
for
them.
it
is
clear
on
this
reasonable
and
necessary
and
also
these
locational
things
that
it
is
difficult
to
convene
a
council
every
time
some
new
point
comes
up.
that
is
why
the
mayor
was
given
discretion,
and
i
submit
that
this
contract
authority
with
guidelines
plus
discretion
is
very
typical
for
congress,
for
state
legislatures,
for
city
councils
all
across
the
country.
as
to
the
architecture
review
board--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--then
the
person...
if
he
would
put
that
on
there,
then
i
believe
the
person
would
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
council,
and
by
the
way,
under
901.1(a)
he
can
go
directly
to
the
council.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
that's
right.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
rigid
thing.
we
have...
a
negotiated
contract
is
what
it
is.
if
they
insist
on
a
contract
without
that
provision
they
want
it
24
hours
a
day.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
he
would
have
to
deny
it.
then
it
would
go
to
the
council.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
however,
i
don't
think
that
would
even
come
up
at
all.
as
to
architectural
review,
we
are
talking
about
the
accepted
and
recognized
architectural
principles.
they
do
have
the
power
to
make
specific
rules
and
expand
their
workbook
so
that
there's
more
specifics.
they
never
reached
us
at
the
time
of
trial
because
there
was
nothing
before
them,
and
here
it
is
1987,
almost
1988.
the
plain
dealer
still
hasn't
applied.
we
are
talking
about
properties.
this
has
been
all
over
the
country.
there's
competition
between
these
street
commercial
strips
and
the
big
shopping
centers.
if
you
had
the
big
shopping
center
there
would
be
no
question,
the
private
owner
of
that
would
tell
the
plain
dealer
where
their
news
boxes
are
going
to
be,
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
we
have
the
public
streets,
and
lakewood
has
got
an
aggressive
program
under
hud.
the
same
thing
has
been
going
on
across
the
country
to
try
to
make
these
commercial
districts
profitable,
to
make
them
aesthetically
appealing,
to
make
them
vital.
they
spent
millions
of
dollars
on
it.
they
are
telling
the
store
front
owner,
you
have
to
fix
your
place
up,
your
signs
have
to
be
reduced
in
size,
and
so
forth,
so
we
end
the
blight.
the
owner
pays
for
that
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
store,
and
he
has
to
repair
it
if
it
is
broke.
he
pays
tax
to
the
city
also.
here
we
want
to
put
the
news
box
there.
the
only
thing
the
city
wants
to
do
is
to
harmonize
that
design
and
color
with
what
the
people
have
in
the
storefront.
i
think
it
is
only
fair
and
reasonable
that
this
be
done.
that
is
the
purpose
of
it,
to
harmonize
the
installation.
otherwise,
what
is
the
use
of
fighting
all
this
blight
and
poor
signage
that
is
causing
this
blight?
it
will
just
end
up
that
everybody
is
going
to
move
to
the
shopping
center,
and
you
can
just
forget
about
the
fight
to
save
the
commercial
districts.
as
to
the
architecture
review,
we
do
have
the
book
of
standards,
and
there
are,
i
submit
that
the
court
has
probably
not
had
a
chance
to
look
at
that,
because
it
defies
placement
in
the
appendix,
but
there
are
several
pages
showing
the
architecture
of
lakewood
and
what
would
fit
in.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
any
particular
problem.
i
think
it
would
have
been
extended
without
any
trouble.
there
are
standards.
they
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
say
we
don't
like
the
article
you
wrote
about
our
book.
therefore
architecturally
we
are
not
going
to
approve
anything
for
you.
it
just
wouldn't
happen.
as
to
insurance,
the
plain
dealer
has
stated
they
never
had
an
accident
with
any
of
these
boxes.
i
just
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
none
of
these
boxes
ever
come
back
dinged
up.
i
would
imagine
some
of
them
have.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
there
are
no
other
comparable
devices
placed
on
the
street.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
the
telephone
booths--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--the
telephone
booths
are
not
the
telephone
booths
of
the
telephone
company.
these
are
telephones
such
as
the
supreme
court
has
right
here
in
the
court.
the
city
wants
them
there.
they
are
a
replacement
for
those
little
red
boxes
that
you
used
to
have
that
if
you
push
the
button
or
open
the
door
the
only
thing
that
would
be
reported
is
the
location
of
something
happening.
they
put
these
telephone
booths,
or
not
booths,
they
are
actually
just
posts
with
telephones
on
them
in
the
right-of-way
as
part
of
the
emergency
communication.
that
way
for
free
a
person
can
go
and
make
a
telephone
call
to
the
police
department,
to
the
fire
department.
they
don't
have
to
go
to
somebody's
house
if
they
need
a
tow
truck
or
an
ambulance.
they
don't
have
to
call
the
police
for
that
if
they
have
their
own
private--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--this
is
a
pay
telephone
booth.
i
am
not
sure
if
all
of
them
are
like
it,
but
the
ones
that
the
city
has,
you
just
dial
0...
in
fact
now
i
guess
it
is
911
in
cuyahoga
county,
and
you
get
the
emergency
service.
so
there
is
no
payment.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
for
free.
you
can
call...
if
you
wanted
to
call
your
tow
truck,
you
would
have
to
place
your
quarter
or
whatever
in
there
to
make
that
call.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
excactly.
you
would
have
to
place
coins
in
it
for
that.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
no,
because
these
are
the
city's.
this
is
rented
or
owned
by
the
city.
it
is
telephone
equipment
of
the
city.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
the
bus
shelters,
i
would
have
to
categorize
that
as
the
city's
property
also.
they
have
bus
stops
all
over
the
city,
and
where
there's
not
what
they
call
an
rta,
regional
transit
authority
shelter,
the
city
has
benches
that
they
have
installed
and
pay
for
themselves.
now,
what
they
have--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--it
is
public,
and
the
people
of
lakewood
pay
sales
tax
to
subsidize
the
running
of
that
bus
service.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
yes,
it
is
the
cuyahoga
county
regional
transit
authority.
everybody
is
taxed
for
that.
instead
of
lakewood
paying
for
the
benches
and
having...
we
have
the
people
maintain
either
one,
but
instead
of
them
paying
for
the
installation
of
those
benches,
rta
puts
them
in
for
free.
that's
the
convenience
for
the
residents.
everything
else
is
on
the
utility
polls.
i
don't
believe--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--there
is
no--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--there
is
just
one
set
of
polls.
those
polls
that
you
see
in
the
photographs
are
cei.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
electric
illuminating
company
poll,
and
everything
is
on
those
polls.
the
wires
that
carry
electricity
for
the
street
lights,
the
wires
that
carry
electricity
for
the
traffic
lights,
the
telephone
wires,
they
are
all
on
there.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
they
are
a
private
company
subject
to
regulation
under...
i
guess
it
is
called
puco.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
they
have
an
easement,
and
they
do
have
to
make
repairs
and
relocate
their--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--no,
these
easements
were
granted
a
long
time
ago,
and
they
are
also
there
for
the
purpose
of
providing
the
city
service,
which
is
the
telephone
communication.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
the
cable
company
by
other
acts
are
permitted
to
have
wires
on
those
polls
also.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
the
cable
television
company
does
have
to
ensure.
there
is...
this
is
not
in
the
record,
i
would
point
out.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
we
do
not
have
a
requirement
on
them
for
insurance.
and
that
is
because
they
are
providing
the
service
to
the
city
for
the
emergency
communications
network.
they
provide
the
other
wires
incidentally--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--yes,
sir?
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
they
were
temporarily
suspended,
and
temporary
measures
put
into
place.
we
got
a
call
from
the
plain
dealer
that
said,
we
want
to
have
those
boxes,
so
we
passed
the
ordinance.
we
are
still
waiting
for
their
application.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
but
that
ordinance
will
dissolve
within
a
short
time
after
the
decision.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
yes,
the
council
either...
if
the
council
takes
other
measures,
depending
on
the
decision
in
this
case,
or
i
think
it
is
a
60-day
period,
it
is
dissolved.
that
was
to
preserve
our
position
in
this
appeal.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
no.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
they
are
not.
the
new
york
times
tried
to
join
the
suit
but
they
were
kicked
out
on
an
abstention
grounds
by
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
they
have
not
applied.
we
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
them.
these
usa
today
units
are
in
somebody
else's
city.
they
are
not
in
the
city
of
lakewood.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
let
me
check.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
no,
that
is
plaintiff's
exhibit,
and
they
put
in
a
whole
bunch
of
exhibits
over
our
objection
as
to
news
boxes
in
other
cities.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
in
other
cities.
we
felt
it
was
irrelevant,
but
the
court
let
it
in.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
no.
there
are
boxes
in
our
city.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
i
think
there
were
16
sites
where
there
are
boxes.
one
was
the
rta
property.
there
are
coffee
shops,
supermarkets.
they
are
all
over
the
city,
within
a
quarter-mile--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--yes.
yes,
there
are.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
they
have
not
seen
fit
to
apply
for
a
permit.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
well,
they
are
on
private
property.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
either
on
private
property
or
public
property
that
is
not
owned
by
the
city
of
lakewood,
so
we
have
no
jurisdiction.
we
are
not
acting
as
owner
as
to
those.
it
would
just
be
if
a
zoning
would
come
up
that
we
would
apply
apply
to
that.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
they
have
private
property?
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
yes,
your
honor,
they
have
16.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
no.
no,
we
have
not
subjected
them
to
any
of
the
requirements.
i
haven't
looked
at
them
as
to...
i
don't
think
that
it
would
apply
to
them
since...
because
of
where
they
are
located,
but
it
may
be
that
we
slipped
up
on
that.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
that...
if
we
have,
i
think
that
it's
because
of
their
location
it
would
not
apply.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
that
is
the
junction
box
for
the
telephone
company.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
yes,
it
is,
and
it--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--no,
they
don't.
that
is
there
for
carrying
the
lines
not
only
of
private
but
also
of
the
city's
communication
system.
this
is
part
of
the
tradeoff
for
the
consideration...
actually,
the
city
is
getting
the
service
on
a
lease
basis.
they
may
even
make
some
money
on
some
of
these
phones
if
people
put
coins
in
them.
so
this
is
part
of
the
tradeoff
that
they
would
permit
them
because
they
are
carrying
emergency
communications.
there
have
been
no
rentals,
no
rentals
of
any
city
property
that
do
not
have
insurance.
as
a
matter
of
risk
management,
every
contract
that
the
city
of
lakewood
makes,
unless
they
slip
up,
their
intention
is
to
have
indemnification
and
insurance.
otherwise--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--any
contract.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
any
contract,
whether
it
is--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--an
easement
is
an
interest
in
real
estate,
which
is
done
by
a
deed
easement,
and
these
things
were
done...
they
had
lighting
and
electricity
probably
before
the
days
of
the
depression,
so
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
about
it.
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
it
is
there.
as
to
alternate...
one
other
point
here.
the
use
of
the
sidewalk
and
tree
lawn
area
has
been
exclusively
used
for
the
provision
of
traditional
city
services
and
utilities.
there
has
been
no
structure
erected
there
that
does
not
provide
the
city
with
a
service,
and
there
is
not
such
a
thing
there
now.
the
traditional
city
services
that
are
provided,
newspaper
and
the
sale
of
newspaper
are
not
traditional
city
services.
therefore,
the
reason
for
having
a
classification.
as
to
alternate
channels
of
communication,
the
plain
dealer
can
have
a
newsboy
selling
it
their.
their
newsboys
do
go
up
and
down
the
street,
up
and
down
the
driveways,
and
deliver
newspapers.
their
drivers
come
to
the
commercial
areas.
they
unload--
mr.
henry
b.
fischer
--sorry.
