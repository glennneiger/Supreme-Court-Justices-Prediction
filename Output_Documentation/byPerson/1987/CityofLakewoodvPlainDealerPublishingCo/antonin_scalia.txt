the
discussion
of
the
gannett
satellite
case,
is
that
what
you
are
referring
to
on
page
43?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
keep
trying
to
go
along.
i
am
sorry.
you
say
there
was
nothing
left
for
the
mayor
to
do,
but
there
is
sort
of
a
residual
clause
in
the
ordinance
which
says
he
can
place,
you
know,
whatever
other
conditions
are
reasonable,
and
there
is
no
limitation
on
what
that
might
happen
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
don't
all
deal
with
the
first
amendment,
either.
i
mean,
that
is
what
our
case
law
says,
that
you
have
to
be
particularly
careful
and
particularly
specific
when
you
are
affecting
first
amendment
rights.
that
is
just
a
pretty
broad--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
do
i
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
i
know
that
those
are
the
only
things
that
come
within
that
language?
what
is
the
precise
language
again?
i
am
looking
for
the
ordinance
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
such
other
conditions
as
may
be
deemed
reasonable
and
necessary
by
the
mayor.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
technical
conditions.
that
could
mean
anything
in
the
world,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
suppose
the
mayor
says
one
of
the
conditions
i
am
attaching
to
this
particular
one
is
that
it
can
only
be
usable
by
the
public
from
10:00
p.m.
to
midnight?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
go
to
the
council?
as
i
read
this
there
is
an
appeal
to
the
council
if
he
refuses
to
grant
or
revokes
a
permit,
but
here
he
is
granting
it
subject
to
this
condition.
does
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
he
has
to
deny
it.

telephone
polls?
what
about
the
telephone
polls?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
a
car
can
run
into
a
telephone
poll.
justice
antonin
scalia
cei
owns
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
cei
is
a
private
company?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
but
they
don't
have
to...
you
don't
require
them
to
ensure
against
liability
from
a
poll
falling
down
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
they
don't
have
to
insure
the
city
against
suits
to
the
city
from
the
negligent
placement
of
the
polls
or
something
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
wires
on
the
polls,
you
have
cable
companies
that
have
wires
on
those
polls?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
those
wires
could
come
down
and
hurt
somebody,
but
does
the
cable
company
have
to
ensure
the
municipality
against--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
am
just
curious.
what
about
the
telephone
company.
they
have
wires
up
there.
do
they
have
to
insure?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
garner--
--that
could
happen...
that
could
happen
if
you
had
precise
standards
and
you
were
denied
and
you
just
claimed
the
mayor
made
a
mistake,
and
you
had
to
go
up
on
appeal,
where
you
might
not
hear
for
two
or
three
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
you
don't
have
enough
confidence
in
your
case
here.

too
late,
they
say.
water
over
the
dam.
before
the
city
ever
thought
of
such
things,
they
had
given
an
easement
already.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
the
easement
has
been
granted
already,
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume,
carrying
justice
o'connor's
question
further,
that
we
do
think
that
this
is
somehow
a
property
interest
and
that
the
city
can
lease
these
stations
in
a
way.
is
it
your
position
that
every
provision
of
the
lease
contract
must
be
spelled
out
in
the
ordinance
and
there
can
be
no
variation
from
one
contract
to
another?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
ask
whether
it
could
be
very
specific.
i
asked
a
simple
question,
must
every
provision
of
the
lease
contract
be
in
the
city
ordinance,
including
the
price,
and
the
mayor
would
not
have
the
ability
to
alter
the
price
from
year
to
year.
would
that
be
too
much
discretion?
i
mean,
i
am
trying
to
think
of
how
you
could
set
up
a
sensible
system.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
the
city
is
being
vindictive
or
coming
down
on
the
press
which
endorses
their
mayor
or
anything
like
that.
it
seems
to
me
they
are
trying
to
do
a
reasonable
thing,
and
i'd
like
to
know,
what
do
you
suggest
they
could
have
done
differently?
for
instance,
that
provision...
such
are
the
terms
and
conditions
deemed
necessary
and
reasonable
by
the
mayor.
well,
i
can
think
of
a
million
things
that
could
come
up,
why
in
one
particular
location
you
have
to
add
an
additional
condition
besides
the
ones
you
normally
think
of,
this
location
is
near
a
school
or
who
knows
what?
i
think
it
seems
to
me
quite
reasonable
to
put
in
that
residual
clause.
now,
you
don't
like
it.
what
would
you
have
said
instead?
justice
antonin
scalia
such
as
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
either,
and
that
is
part
of
the
problem.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
counsel
for
the
city
raises
is
a
reasonable
thing.
you
need
a
little
bit
of
give
if
you
are
writing
god
knows
how
many
contracts
for
stations
all
over
the
city.
they
won't
necessarily
be
identical.
now,
how
can
that
all
be
handled
and
specified
in
one
city
ordinance?
