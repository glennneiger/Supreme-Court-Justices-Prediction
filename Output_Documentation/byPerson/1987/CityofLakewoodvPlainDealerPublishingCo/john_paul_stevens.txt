mr.
fischer,
did
you
make
a
jurisdictional
argument
in
your
jurisdictional
statement,
in
your
brief
on
the
merits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
page
31
of
the
blue
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fischer,
may
i
go
back?
you
cited
us
to
the
findings
on
page
a30.
you
said
they
said
they
would
grant
the
permission.
as
i
read
that,
it
only
said
they
would
grant
them
in
the
commercial
districts,
but
not
along
clifton
boulevard
at
the
sites
requested,
all
of
which
lie
in
the
residential
district.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
the...
i
gather
probably
the
plain
dealer
has
some
on
private
property,
too,
don't
they,
or
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
have
these
boxes
on
private
property
located
within
the
city?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
those
boxes
subjected
to
any
kind
of
architectural
design,
zoning
requirements?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garner,
before
you
get
all
the
way
into
the
merits--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
had
missed
the
fact
that
the
city
was
really
making
an
independent
jurisdictional
argument
which
they
have
advanced
here
on
the
ground
as
i
understand
it
that
all
you
had
to
do
was
apply
for
these
rental
units
and
no
doubt
you
could
have
had
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
say
the
district
court
so
found.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
why
you
are
sure
you
will
get
your
boxes.

justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
why
you
are
sure
you
will
get
your
boxes.
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
mr.
garner,
but
suppose
the
regulation
is
no
more
than
one
news
rack
on
any
corner
or
whatever
it
might
be,
and
then
there
is
some
dispute
about
which
one
of
the
competing
newspapers
wants
that
corner.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
record
suggests
u.s.
news
and
world
report
gets
one,
new
york
times
another,
and
the
plain
dealer
the
third.
supposing
a
fourth
paper
comes
in,
and
they
say,
well,
we
have
already
used
up
all
the
three
stand
slots?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
they
make
a
map,
and
on
the
map
they
list
all
the
permissible
sites,
and
no
more
than
three
at
any
one
of
these
sites,
and
you
people
all
get
these
three,
and
a
fourth
paper
comes
in.
i
guess
they
are
just
out
of
luck.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
am
giving
you
a
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
hypothetical
ordinance.
you
get
all
the
standards
you
want
in,
and
they
are
very,
very
definite,
but
these
are
the
sites,
no
more
than
three
at
any
one
of
these
30
or
40
sites,
they
are
all
taken,
and
somebody
else
comes
along
and
said,
we
would
like
a
site.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
suppose
they
then
say,
well,
since
we
can't
accommodate
all
four
without
having
what
we
consider
visual
blight
by
too
many
of
these,
we
just
decided
not
to
allow
any.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
really
not
sure
that
isn't
some--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garner,
can
i
ask
you,
supposing
we
were
to
affirm,
i
may
have
the
facts
a
little
wrong,
but
the
court
of
appeals
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
the
ordinance
in
total,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
strike
down
the
portion
of
the
ordinance
that
authorizes
the
city
to
rent
the
property
for
this
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
we
just
were
to
affirm,
there
would
in
effect
be
no
ordinance
pertaining
to
this
subject
on
the
books.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
they
have
a
new
ordinance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happens
through
this
lawsuit
if
we
get
another
ordinance
in
place?
i
thought
the
new
ordinance
was
just
temporary,
pending
the
resolution
of
this
lawsuit.
is
that
not
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
the
objectionable
features.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
while
that
ordinance
is
in
effect,
have
you
gone
ahead
and
installed
some
boxes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because,
you
know,
time
is
of
the
essence
in
these
first
amendment
issues,
i
understand.
you
can't
wait
for
an
appeal.
0
[generallaughter.]
you
had
better
get
those
boxes
out
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you'd
rather
win
the
lawsuit
than
get
the
boxes
out
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
because
you're
concerned
about
the
79
other
municipalities,
i
gather.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
because
of
your
concern
about
all
the
other
municipalities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
acquiesce
in
the
unfettered
discretion
of
the
mayor,
i
presume.
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
another
subject?
are
there
any
ordinances
either
in
cuyahoga
county
that
pertain
to
the
retail
sale
of
newspapers,
magazines,
and
the
like
on
public
property?
i
know
in
a
lot
of
cities
there
are
public
newsstands
that
are
operated
by
human
beings
rather
than
these
inanimate
objects.
are
they
generally
the
subject
of
ordinance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
that
area.
i
see.
