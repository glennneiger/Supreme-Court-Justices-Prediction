was

there
is

in

not,
an
interim

that
replaces
the
one
that
we
are

here?
justice

and
the
interim

was
adjusted
to,
what,
to

some
of

that

to

i
notice
that
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
rely
very
heavily
on

was
there
an
appellate
process
in
that
case?
justice
william

well,
mr.
garner,
was
the
idea
that
if
this
court
affirmed,
then
after
60
days
would
not
the
interim
ordinance
continue
in

justice

the
first
of
these
cases,
city
of
lakewood
versus
plain
dealer
publishing
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
appellee
is
a
newspaper
publisher.
the
appellee
challenged,
on
first
amendment
grounds,
the
facial
constitutionality
of
appellant
city's
ordinance
authorizing
the
mayor
to
grant
or
deny
applications
for
annual
permits
to
publishers
to
place
their
newsracks
on
public
property.
the
ordinance
provides
that
if
the
application
is
granted
that
the
permit
is
subject
to
any
terms
and
conditions
deemed
necessary
and
reasonable
by
the
mayor.
the
district
court
rejected
the
publishers
first
amended
argument
and
found
the
ordinance
constitutional
in
its
entirety.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
finding
the
ordinance
unconstitutional
on
the
ground
among
others
that
the
ordinance
violated
the
first
amendment
because
it
gave
the
mayor
unbounded
discretion
to
grant
or
deny
a
permit
application
and
to
place
unlimited
terms
and
conditions
on
any
permit
that
the
mayor
issued.
we
affirmed
in
part
and
remand.
we
hold
that
the
appellee
publisher
may
bring
a
facial
challenge
to
the
ordinance
without
applying
for
and
being
denied
a
permit
when
a
licensing
statute
vests
unbridled
discretion
in
a
government
official
on
whether
they
permit
or
a
deny
expressive
activity,
one
who
is
subject
to
the
law
may
challenge
it
facially
without
first,
submitting
to
the
licensing
process,
such
as
statute
constitutes
a
prior
restraint
that
may
result
in
censorship,
engendering
risks
to
free
expression
that
can
be
effectively
prevented
only
through
a
facial
challenge.
the
mere
existence
of
the
licensor's
unfettered
discretion,
coupled
with
the
power
of
prior
restraint,
intimidates
parties
into
censoring
their
own
speech.
and
standards
limiting
the
licensor's
discretion
provide
a
guidepost
that
check
the
licensor
and
allow
courts
quickly
and
easily
to
determine
whether
the
licensor
is
discriminating
against
disfavored
speech.
without
those
standards,
the
difficulties
of
proof
and
case-by-case
nature
of
as
applied
challenges
render
the
licensor's
action
in
large
measure
effectively
unreviewable.
we
find
no
merit
in
the
city's
argument
that
the
ordinance
is
not
subject
to
facial
challenge
because
the
use
of
newsracks
may
be
prohibited
entirely.
first
amendment
protected
activity
is
implicated
by
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance
imposing
less
than
the
total
prohibition,
even
assuming
that
newsracks
may
be
prohibited
entirely.
the
provisions
giving
the
major
discretion
to
deny
or
permit
application
and
authority
to
condition
or
permit
on
any
terms,
he
deems
necessary
unreasonable
fall
under
the
first
amendment
doctrine
forbidding
unbridled
discretion.
that
doctrine
requires
that
the
limits
the
city
claims
are
implicit
in
its
law
be
made
explicit
by
textual
incorporation,
binding
judicial
or
administrative
construction
or
well-established
practice.
the
ordinance
is
a
minimum
requirement
that
the
mayor
state
his
reasons
for
denying
a
permit
does
not
provide
the
standards
necessary
to
insure
constitutional
decision-making,
nor
does
it
of
necessity
provide
a
solid
foundation
for
eventual
judicial
review.
even
if
judicial
review
under
the
ordinance's
provisions
were
relatively
speedy,
such
review
does
not
substitute
for
concrete
standards
to
guide
the
decisionmaker's
discretion.
justice
white
dissents
and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
o'connor
joined.
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
