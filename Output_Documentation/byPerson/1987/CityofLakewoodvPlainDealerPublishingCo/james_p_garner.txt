mr.
james
p.
garner
justice
brennan,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
do
not
agree
with
too
much
of
what
mr.
fischer
said,
but
i
believe
he
did
recognize
that
we
claim,
at
least,
and
he
is
absolutely
correct,
that
this
case
involves
a
potential
and
a
very
serious
potential
for
censorship.
more
specifically,
the
city
of
lakewood
originally
tried
an
outright
ban
on
the
news
racks,
and
the
district
court
found
that
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
city
abandoned
that
route
and
enacted
the
ordinance--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--if
the
district
court
was
wrong,
the--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--could
have
appealed,
yes...
if
i
might
be
precise,
your
honor,
we
filed
our
complaint
and
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
based
on
the
illegality
of
the
violation
of
our
first
amendment
rights
with
respect
to
the
complete
ban.
the
judge
summoned
us
into
chambers,
told
us
what
his
decision
was
some
time
after
the
motion
had
been
submitted,
and
said
that
he
was
granting
the
motion
but
was
holding
in
abeyance
for
a
period
of
six
days
the
entry
of
the
final
order
to
permit
the
city
if
it
chose
to--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
not
to
the
issues
before
your
honor.
they
do
permit
us
there,
and
i
think
the
precedents
of
this
court
when
you
have
this
unfettered,
complete
discretion
in
city
officials,
not
only
the
mayor
but
the
architectural
board,
the
precedents
are
clear
that
it
is
facially
challenged
on
that
ground.
it
is
the
potential
for
censorship
which
results
from
that
which
creates
the
constitutional
confrontation
which
we
feel
must
be
resolved
in
our
favor.
so
we
feel
the
complete
ban
is
not
before
your
honors,
and
we
feel
that
the
discretion
in
the
mayor,
unfettered,
the
architectural
board,
no
standards
nor
guides
whatsoever,
and
this
is
not,
we
suggest--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--yes.
mr.
james
p.
garner
well,
i
don't
know
whether
we
could
have
had
them
or
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
garner
if
the
mayor
found
that
no
reasonable
reason
to
deny
us
or
he
found
no
necessary
reason
to
deny
us,
presumably
we
might
have
had
our
permit,
but
it
is
the
potential
for
censorship
here.
we
are
talking
for
the
moment
about
the
city
of
lakewood,
but
if
i
could
make
a
short
excursion
outside
the
record,
in
the
city...
in
the
county
of
cayuga,
where
cleveland
is
located,
there
are
73...
73
separate
municipalities.
now,
whether
or
not
mayor
sinagra
would
have
readily
issued
the
permit
to
the
plain
dealer...
by
the
way,
he
was
reelected
yesterday,
and
he
serves
another
term--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--endorsed
by
the
plain
dealer,
i
might
add,
your
honor.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
james
p.
garner
sir?
i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
p.
garner
the
experience
that
the
plain
dealer
might
well
anticipate
from
some
of
the
other
municipalities
where
there
have
been
rather
detailed
investigations
and
stories
in
the
plain
dealer
with
respect
to
city
affairs,
i
think
there
would
be
serious
question
if
this
unfettered
discretion,
and
there
was
no
right
by
the
plain
dealer
really
effectively
to
go
anywhere.
the
mayor
says,
no,
that's
it.
he
says
safety,
i'm
not
satisfied,
that's
the
end
of
it.
the
architectural
board
said
it's
not
pretty
enough.
that's
the
end
of
it.
we
have
no
place
to
go.
mr.
james
p.
garner
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
appeals
process
when
we
are
talking
about
first
amendment
rights
is
insufficient.
i
think
the...
for
example,
this
case
started
in
1982.
here
we
are
almost
to
1988.
i
think
the
precedents
of
this
court
are
ample
to
support
the
proposition
that
when
first
amendment
rights
are
denied,
that
some
kind
of
an
appellate
process
is
sufficient
to
rectify
it.
it
probably
would
be
anywhere
from
two
to
four
years
to
obtain
a
complete
administrative
and
judicial
review
in
the
state
of
ohio
through
the
ohio
supreme
court,
and
that
we
submit
just
does
not
square
with
the
notion
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
james
p.
garner
if
we...
well,
if
we
had
precise
standards
i
don't
see
there
would
be
much
to
be
arguing
about.
mr.
james
p.
garner
i
think
in
this
case
news
racks
are
capable
of
very
precise
legislation.
we
are
not
talking
about
something
nebulous
about
words
that
might
incite
somebody
to
a
riot
or
something.
we
are
talking
about
a
news
rack.
everyone
knows
what
they
look
like.
everyone
knows
how
big
they
are.
if
the
mayor
or
the
city
council
feels
that
five
feet
is
the
distance
it
must
be
away
from
a
fire
hydrant,
so
be
it.
five
feet,
not
four,
five
or
more.
mr.
james
p.
garner
on
numbers,
your
honor,
the
city
of
lakewood
has
a
requirement
of
no
more
than
three
abreast
at
this
time
or
at
any
one
location,
three
abreast.
at
this
time
or
at
the
time
this
commenced
the
plain
dealer
did
not
complain
about
that,
feeling
that
that
is
within
the
one
of
what
is
reasonable
in
the
city
of
lakewood.
whether
that
would
be
true
in
another
city,
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
it
would
depend
on,
i
believe,
the
application
of
some
of
the
tests
developed
by
your
honors
in
other
cases,
the
rockford
school
case,
the
grayned
test,
the
test
of
compatibility.
if
five
is
compatible,
then
that
is
right.
some
cities
have
a
great
many
more
newspapers
to
be
distributed.
coming
back
to
your
precise
question,
i
think
a
limit
of
one
would
be
suspect
for
two
reasons.
one,
i
think
it
is
too
restrictive,
and
secondly,
it
does
offer
perhaps
even
a
pretextual
use
of--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--which...
a
precise
selection
of
which
publisher
can
occupy
that
spot.
mr.
james
p.
garner
well,
they
would
have
to
move...
they
would
have
to
move
down
the
street
a
ways.
they
are
not
forbidden
anywhere
else
in
the
city.
just,
they
can't
attach
it--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--i
don't
believe,
your
honor--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--the
map
listed
all
the
permissible
sites.
i
believe
what
is
in
that--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--oh.
mr.
james
p.
garner
if
we
are
talking
about
the
traditional
public
forum
here,
which
is,
of
course,
the
entire
sidewalk,
an
entire
block
long,
and
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
that
three
boxes
would
occupy
the
whole
block.
they
would
occupy
that
portion
of
the
block,
but
the
rest
of
that
block
would
be
available
for
other
publications.
mr.
james
p.
garner
i
think
that
a
complete
ban
on
boxes...
is
that
your
honor's
question--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--anywhere
in
the
jurisdiction?
mr.
james
p.
garner
again,
i
don't
believe
it
is
in
the
case,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
would
clearly
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
p.
garner
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights?
mr.
james
p.
garner
we
don't
agree
that
we
are
renting
space.
that
is
the
city's
characterization
of
what
is
occurring
here,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
james
p.
garner
we
don't...
i
can't
quite
agree
with
your
characterization
of
permanently
set
aside.
mr.
james
p.
garner
i
think
any
of
the
cases,
lovell,
or
any
of
the
cases,
shuttlesworth,
coxby,
louisiana,
any
of
the
cases
which
talk
about
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
james
p.
garner
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
a
permanent
giving
up.
i
said
we--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--no,
no,
it
is
not
hourly,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
garner
well,
it
could
be
whatever--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--whatever
is
reasonably
necessary,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
garner
i
think
that's
probably
correct.
mr.
james
p.
garner
not
if
there
is
a
legitimate
or
logical
reason
for
moving
it,
street
repairs,
parade
going
to
occupy
the
property,
whatever
reason.
mr.
james
p.
garner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
garner
yes.
mr.
james
p.
garner
if...
two
or
three
observations,
your
honor.
one,
if
it
is
a
box,
if
there
is
a
box
available
that
could
meet
the
specifications,
obviously.
mr.
james
p.
garner
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
would
be
possible.
you
might
be
coming
back
to
the--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--i
don't
think
if
it
is
precise
and
it
is
reasonable
and
it
is
available,
i
can't
say
that
it
is
necessarily
wholly
unreasonable.
mr.
james
p.
garner
having
the
architectural
board
with
this
unlimited
discretion
permits
them
to
turn
down
any
box
that
they
desire
to
turn
down,
no
matter
what
the
publisher
is,
whether
it
is
because
of
the
box
or
whether
it
is
a
pretextual
reason.
mr.
james
p.
garner
we
would
be
pleased
and,
i
think,
would
have
been
pleased
had
we
been
able
to
arrive
at
a
complete
agreement
with
the
city
of
lakewood
with
respect
to
specificity
in
the
ordinance
from
top
to
bottom.
we
failed
in
that--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--they
had
no
idea.
they
had
never
considered
the
matter.
the
testimony
in
the
record
says
they--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--they
were
asked
at
the
trial,
yes.
mr.
james
p.
garner
no,
no.
we
are...
as
i
believe
we
mentioned
earlier,
your
honor,
we
feel
we
have
the
opportunity
or
the
right
to
test
this
uncontrolled
discretion
facially.
mr.
james
p.
garner
i
don't
recall,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
garner
not
entirely.
it
separated
the
ban
in
areas
zoned
residential,
and
struck
down
the
rest
of
it
really
three...
they
found
three
flaws,
three
constitutional
flaws,
and
they
struck
down
all
of
the
rest
except
for
the
residential
ban
because
it
was
not
separable.
mr.
james
p.
garner
they
struck
that
down,
yes.
mr.
james
p.
garner
they
have
enacted
a
new
ordinance.
mr.
james
p.
garner
yes,
sir.
yes,
justice
stevens.
in
1987,
earlier
this
year,
i
believe,
they
enacted
the
new
one.
mr.
james
p.
garner
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
what
it
says
is
that
it
suspends
the
operation
of
the
mayor's
discretion
and
the
architectural
board's
discretion.
those
are
not
part
of
the
new
ordinance.
the
unlimited
discretion.
mr.
james
p.
garner
until
some
60
days
after
this
court
reaches
its
decision,
or
until--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--well,
those
particular
points
are,
yes.
the
rest
of
it
is
all
in
position.
mr.
james
p.
garner
yes.
that
is
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
garner
as
a
threat?
mr.
james
p.
garner
well,
i
don't
know
what
would
happen,
depending
on
what
this
court
does,
obviously.
i
think
they
might
very
well
go
back
to
where
they
started,
the
complete
ban.
mr.
james
p.
garner
yes.
well,
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
garner
would
they
pass
it?
well--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--the
substitute
ordinance
is
substantially
in
toto
in
effect.
the
portions
that
are
not
in--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--excuse
me.
mr.
james
p.
garner
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
james
p.
garner
no,
we
have
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
garner
because
if--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--we
thought,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
we
think
this
is
a
very
important
case,
and
from
the
plain
dealer's
immediate
standpoint
certainly--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
think
we
are
entitled
to
a
decision
that
we
obtain...
that
we
obtained
from
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
did
not
appeal
this
case.
we
were
satisfied,
or
we
did
not
seek
certiorari
from
this
court.
so
what
we
want
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
ruled.
we
think
that
is
satisfactory,
and
that
is
satisfactory
whether
we
go
to
the
other
73
other
municipalities.
mr.
james
p.
garner
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
garner
yes.
the
plain
dealer's
concern
about
all
the
other--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--all
73,
yes,
and
more.
that's
just
the
one
county,
now.
that's
just
the
one
county.
there
are
a
number
of
other
municipalities
in
the
surrounding
counties.
oh,
yes.
and
that
is
the
reason
that
we
are
here,
because
mr.
fischer
brought
us
here,
but
that's
the
reason
that
we
urge
this
court.
mr.
james
p.
garner
in
lakewood?
mr.
james
p.
garner
not
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
garner
as
far
as
i
know,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
p.
garner
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
anybody
would
have
been
free
to--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--without
an
ordinance.
mr.
james
p.
garner
i
think
that's...
i
can't
speak...
yes,
it
is
true,
your
honor.
in
a
number
of
cities
there
are
no
ordinances
whatsoever
dealing
with
news
racks.
mr.
james
p.
garner
right,
they
acquiesce
in
it,
correct.
mr.
james
p.
garner
well,
if
it
is
unfettered,
it
is
unexercised
as
well.
mr.
james
p.
garner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
garner
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
there
is
probably
more
call
for
different
publications
in
the
city
of
washington
certainly
than
the
city
of
lakewood,
ohio.
a
great
many
more
publishers
want
their
newspaper
here
in
the
nation's
capital
than
they
do
in
the
city
of
cleveland
or
its
suburban
areas.
mr.
james
p.
garner
yes.
with
respect
to
the
insurance
i
would
say...
make
a
couple
of
observation.
one
has
two
parts
to
it.
one
is
the
indemnity
which,
as
i
read
it,
is
so
broad
that
the
plain
dealer
or
the
press,
small
"p",
is
called
upon
to
indemnify
the
city
for
things
that
may
even
be
the
city's
fault
if
there
is
a
news
rack
even
collaterally
involved
one
way
or
another,
and
i
think
that
kind
of
provision,
without
respect
to
the
first
amendment,
would
be
abhorrent.
more
importantly,
the
insurance,
from
the
questions
of
the
court,
i
believe
they
were
all
directed
toward
the
fact
that
the
requirement
is
solely
for
insurance
to
be
provided
by
the
newspaper
publishers
who
use
these
news
racks,
the
other
privately
owned
utilities.
nobody
else
is
called
upon
for
the
same
thing.
we
think
that
quite
clearly
singles
out
the
press
in
an
unconstitutional--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--yes.
may
i
state
my
view
of
what
i
think
the
relationship
is
of
the
plain
dealer
or
a
publisher
with
its
rack
on
the
street
and
the
city?
we
don't
view
it
as
a
possessory
interest
of
any
sort,
nor
do
we
view
it
as
a
property
right.
the
word
"rental"
connotes
to
me
some
sort
of
a
passage
of
an
interest
in
real
property,
paying
money
for
a
right
to
do
something.
it
is
assignable,
it
is
this,
it
is
that.
what
i
conceive
or
perceive
we
have
is
a
first
amendment
right,
the
same
as
it
would
if
we
had
a
news
hawker
out
there.
a
news
hawker
can
stand
there.
we
have
a
first--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--yes.
oh,
there
is
no
question
about
that,
that
this
is
a
fixed
device,
it
is
there,
it
doesn't
get
cold,
it
doesn't
go
to
lunch.
it
is
there
to
provide
newspapers
to
the
public
at
all
hours--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--twenty-four
hours
a
day.
we
think
it
is--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--well,
i
think
it
is
different,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
different
in
particular
in
the
respect
that
it
far
better
serves
the
public
that
may
desire
to
buy
newspapers.
it
serves
them
24
hours
a
day.
mr.
james
p.
garner
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that,
your
honor.
no.
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that.
i
think
the
evil
was
the
one
that
was
suggested
by
the
earlier
questioning,
and
that
is
the
singling
out
of
the
press.
mr.
james
p.
garner
do
they
do
the
same
with
the
electric
utility?
mr.
james
p.
garner
well,
i
think
the
city
council...
certainly
that
could
be
rectified,
justice
scalia.
mr.
james
p.
garner
well,
i
think
that...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
it
depends
a
lot
on
statutory...
state
statutes
which
establish
the
relationship
of
some
of
these
municipalities
and
the
utilities,
and
i
am
not
an
authority
on
that
subject,
but
if
there
were
a
demonstrated
need
that
there
were
safety
hazards
involved
with
the
telephone
polls,
i
am
sure
one
way
or
another
a
city
would
be
successful
in
obtaining
insurance
coverage
to
protect
it.
i
might
add
that
the
record
is
barren
here
to
show
that
there
has
ever
been
a
safety
factor
with
respect
to
news
racks.
it
just
doesn't
exist.
mr.
james
p.
garner
i
think
the
ordinance
could
be
very
specific,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
garner
well,
i
don't
like
it
because
of
the
threat
of
censorship,
your
honor.
what
would
i
have
said?
it
was
something
considerably
less
than
that.
i
think
that--
mr.
james
p.
garner
--such
as
the...
if
there
is
in
the
future
there
arises
a
safety
factor
demonstrated
to
the
satisfaction
of
whoever,
the
matter
will
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
publisher
and
it
will
be
discussed
with
the
publisher,
whatever.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
garner
well,
i
don't
know
of
anything
that
the...
in
the
four
or
five
years
that
we
have
been
talking
about
this
that
the
city
has
suggested
they
would
add,
except
one
thing.
they
said
they
forgot
to
put
in
a
prohibition
against
placing
a
rack
in
a
handicapped...
or
a
news
rack
in
a
handicapped
ramp.
so
the
new
ordinance
has
that
in.
one
possibility,
obviously,
your
honor,
is
amending
the
ordinance
when
something
occurs
to
them.
if
there
is
an
emergency,
if
halloween
a
prankster
moves
a
box
out
in
the
middle
of
the
street,
obviously
the
local
police
are
going
to
handle
the
situation.
but
i
think
that
this
is
an
area
where
you
are
dealing
with
boxes
that
everybody
can
identify.
they
understand
them.
i
think
you
can
be
absolutely
specific.
except
for
the
direst
of
emergencies,
most
anything
that
turns
up
subsequently
could
be
very
well
handled
at
the
next
regular
or
special
meeting
of
the
council.
mr.
james
p.
garner
so
far
as
i
know,
there
are
no
public
newsstands
on
public
property
in
cuyahoga
county.
mr.
james
p.
garner
i
know
of
none.
unlike
washington.
i
don't
recall
ever
having
seen
one.
mr.
james
p.
garner
oh,
yes,
the
stations.
mr.
james
p.
garner
bus
stations
have
news
racks.
the
bus
stations
do.
the
railroad
station
does.
any
number
of
the
rta
stations,
the
rapid
transit
stations,
all
those
do.
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe,
your
honors,
we
have
covered
everything
that
i
desire
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
and
it
is
obvious
that
we
urge
affirmance
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
entirety.
thank
you.
