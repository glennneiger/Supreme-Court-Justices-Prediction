justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
no
discretion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
authority
given
to
the
mayor
by
the
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
it
was
subject
to
his
control,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
then
if
those
were
satisfied
the
mayor
had
to
issue
the
permit?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
the
court
below
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
he
say?
what
did
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
it
say
about
the
breadth
of
the
ordinance?
what
was
the
court's
below
view
of
the
mayor's
discretion?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
then
how
about
the...
what
did
it
say
about
the
mayor?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
the
mayor
was
given
too
broad
discretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
have
to
disagree
with
them
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
just
disagreeing
with
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
just
disagreeing
with
the
courts
below.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
construction
of
the
ordinance.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
do
have
to
disagree
with
the
construction
of
the
ordinance
with
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
your
jurisdictional
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
residential
issue
is
not
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
the
only
numbers
you
can
call?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
or
if
you
wanted
to
call
your
wife
and
say,
i'm
going
to
be
late
for
dinner.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
when
you
grant
an
easement.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
city
could
have
kept--
justice
byron
r.
white
--let's
assume
that
the
city
did
have
the
constitutional
right
to
keep
the
plain
dealer
from
having
any
boxes
on
the
city
streets.
would
that
make
any
difference
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whatever
the
standard
is,
somebody
can
misapply
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
hourly,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
yearly
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
quit--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
you
didn't
get
enough
nickels
and
dimes
in
it,
you
would
move
it,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
up
until
that
time,
it
is
going
to
be
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
on
the
discretion--
justice
byron
r.
white
--end,
take
the
city...
is
it
the
city
architect,
architectural
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
ordinance
said,
the
design
of
these
25
by
50
inch
boxes
shall
be
the
design
specified
by
the
architectural
board,
and
the
architectural
board
meets,
and
it
publishes
a
specific
design.
if
you
want
a
news
box,
you
would
have
to
have
it
this
way,
no
other
way.
and
there
is
a...
you
wouldn't
have
any
objection
if
in
the
ordinance
it
says
25
by
50
and
the
design
is
as
follows,
colon,
and
it
has
a
drawing
in
it
of
the
precise--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
you
would
have
to
make
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
are
back
to
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
get
on
the
sidewalk.
what
about
my...
what
if
it
were
perfectly
feasible
to
make
a
box
precisely
to
conform
with
the
architectural
board's
specifications?
would
you
say
that
that
is
uncontrolled
discretion?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
having
the
architecture
board
have
so
little
bit
of
discretion
even
gives
you
a
little
bit
more
room.
it
is
more
favorable
to
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would
rather
have
it
this
way
and
have
the
architectural
board
specify
in
detail
what
your
box
has
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
ever
ask
the
architectural
board
what
kind
of
a
box
they
might
approve?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you
ask
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
never
showed
them
a
box?
justice
byron
r.
white
suspends?
you
mean
until
when?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
any
other
news
boxes
on
the
street?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
one
has
taken
advantage
of
this
interim
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
there
hadn't
been
this
interim
ordinance,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
ordinance
in
effect
at
all
after
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
if
you
had
wanted
to
get
on
the
street,
you
would
have
a
little
problem
getting
your
boxes
on
the
street
without
an
ordinance.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
would
you
just
say
we
are
going
to
put
them
up
because
we
have
the
constitutional
right
to
be
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
don't
object
to
the
newspapers
being
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
exercises
it
by
not
objecting.
