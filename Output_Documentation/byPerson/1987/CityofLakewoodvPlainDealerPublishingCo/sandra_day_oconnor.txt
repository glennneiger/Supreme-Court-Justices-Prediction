if
the
ordinance
is
in
fact
setting
up
some
kind
of
unlimited
discretion
in
the
mayor
to
grant
or
deny
the
permit,
and
if
the
court
below
was
correct
about
that,
then
i
assume
jurisdiction
would
lie,
wouldn't
it,
to
make
a
facial
challenge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fischer,
does
the
city
require
the
furnishing
of
liability
insurance
and
holding
harmless
for
other
similar
devices
that
are
placed
on
the
streets,
or
is
it
just
applicable
to
these
news
vending
boxes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
city
doesn't
have
any
of
these
ordinary
pay
telephone
booths?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
any
event,
no
insurance
or
hold
harmless
is
required
from
the
phone
company?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
the
bus
shelters?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fischer,
what
about
the
devices
shown,
for
example,
on
plaintiff's
exhibit
34?
what
is
that
box?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
is
owned
by
a
private
company,
the
telephone
company?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
they
have
to
provide
insurance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
there
was
an
appeal
process.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
case
from
this
court
do
you
cite
for
that
conclusion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
no,
that
a
flat
ban
on
the
renting
of
space
for
vending
machines
would
come--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
am
just
asking
what
case
you
rely
upon
from
this
court
that
space
on
the
sidewalk
must
be
permanently
set
aside
for
the
newspaper's
vending
machines.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
stop
disagreeing
with
my
characterization
and
give
me
a
citation,
if
you
would.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
didn't
find
any
of
those
directly
relevant
to
the
giving
up
of
space
on
a
city
sidewalk
or
otherwise
for
a
permanent
device
of
some
kind.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
is
just
temporary,
pending
the
resolution
of
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
city
takes
the
position,
i
guess,
that
it
is
renting
the
space
for
the
vending
devices
and
that
it
would
charge...
require
the
furnishing
of
insurance
for
anyone
who
rented
space
from
the
city.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
we
think
that
it
is
different,
that
it
is
a
physical
occupation
of
city
property,
and
that
that
is
distinguishable
from
allowing
people
to
walk
on
the
sidewalk
and
sell
newspapers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
week
in
and
week
out,
month
in
and
month
out.
now,
what
if
we
think
that
is
different?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
assert
that
it
is
not
possible
under
the
first
amendment
for
the
city
to
require
indemnity
insurance
for
those
devices?
i
think
that
is
a
remarkable
proposition.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
they
say
that
for
every
situation
in
which
they
are
granting
a
permit
to
physically
occupy
city
property
they
are
going
to
require
that
type
of
insurance?
