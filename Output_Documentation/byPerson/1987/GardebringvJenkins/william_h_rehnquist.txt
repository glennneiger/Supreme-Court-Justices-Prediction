you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
answer
questions
of
law
in
interrogatories
anyway,
do
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
was
that
what
was
done
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kirwin,
we
will
hear
now,
from
you,
mr.

thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
i
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.

chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
davison,
your
opponent
says
that
the
district
court
in
the
eighth
circuit
required
payments
to
be
made
to
your
clients
which
were
contrary
to
the
congressional
authorization.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
it
was
clearly
an
overpayment
under
the
act
of
congress?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
authority
did
the
eighth
circuit
cite
for
that
proposition?
what
of
our
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
was
a
violation
of
the
regulation,
as
you
contend.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
a
constitutional
problem.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
it
has,
mr.
kirwin,
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.

gardebring
against
jenkins
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
