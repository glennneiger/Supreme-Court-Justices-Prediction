justice
stevens
mr.
larkin,
can
i
backup
for
a
second?
you
described
three
different
categories
of
notice
that
you
say
the
secretary
under
its
regulations
must
give.
one
is
applicants
about
the
basic
information
and
the
second
was
recipients
were
told
to
contact
their
caseworker
and
third,
is
the
statement
of
reasons
when
there
is
an
adverse
action.
as
to
the
first,
which
you
referred
only
to
applicants,
that
you
are
referring
are
you
not,
to
the
regulation
which
the
interrogatory
answer
that
i
think
justice
o'connor
referred
to
earlier,
described
as
referring
to
applicants
and
recipients.
justice
stevens
i
think
it
is
206.10(a)(ii).
justice
stevens
what
were
the
pages
again?
justice
stevens
which
of
those,
just
to
help?
i
have
in
front
of
me
the
red
brief
at
page
18,
which
quotes
one
of
these,
which
is
18
and
19
of
the
red
brief.
i
gather
that
is
the
one
at
89,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
okay,
i
am
sorry.
justice
stevens
i
see.
and
is
it
i
that
refers
to
applicants
and
ii
that
refers
to
recipients,
is
that
how
it
works?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
ms.
davison,
can
i
interrupt
you
right
there,
because
there
is
one
fact
i
am
a
little
puzzled
about.
she
was
a
re-applicant
was
she,
in
november
of
1982,
having
been
off
the
rolls
for
how
long?
justice
stevens
well,
then
was
she
a
recipient
in
september
of
1981?
justice
stevens
so
she
got
the
september
letter?
justice
stevens
so
the
fact
then,
i
mean
if
that
were
adequate
and
i
know
you
dispute
that,
but
if
that
were
adequate
then
she
would
be
on
notice
of
at
least
the
contents
of
that
letter.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
when
did
she
get
that?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
that
was
because
the
program
did
not
go
into
effect
until
february
of
1982?
justice
stevens
but
she
did
have
notice
that
lump-sums
were
a
matter
of
special
interest
to
the
agency.
justice
stevens
i
understand
what
it
was,
but
she
did
have
a
duty
to
report
lump-sums.
justice
stevens
she
reported
the
second
lump-sum--
justice
stevens
--well,
i
don't
understand.
on
the
one
hand
you
seem
to
be
telling
me
that
november
1892
her
lump-sum
was
explained
to
her
and
it
had
been
treated
under
the
old
rule
and
therefore,
she
had
a
right
to
rely
on
it
and
now
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
she
did
not
know
anything
about
it.
justice
stevens
well,
she
had
been
told
in
september
of
1981,
though,
she
had
gotten
that
letter.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
well?
justice
stevens
now,
is
the
only
lump-sum
that
she
received
that
is
relevant,
the
one
that
she
received
between
the
receipt
of
the
letter
and
the
time
she
reapplied?
justice
stevens
and
was
that
lump-sum
reported?
justice
stevens
but
she
already
spent
it.
justice
stevens
and
the
problem
was
that
she
had
already
spent
it
in
those
two
days,
that
is
right,
i
remember
it
now.
justice
stevens
may
i
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the...
your
claim
depends
on
there
having
been
a
violation
of
law
by
the
state
administrator,
at
the
time
of
the
second
application
in
november
of
1982,
by
failure
to
explain
the
lump-sum
requirement.
would
in
your
view,
would
it
have
been
satisfactory
to
explain
that
requirement
orally?
justice
stevens
well,
what
it
says
is
in
writing
about
coverage
conditions
of
eligibility,
scope
of
the
program,
and
related
services
available.
i
suppose
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
precisely
what
detail
that
information
has
to
be
given
in.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
what
if,
at
the
time
of
the
application,
your
client
got
a
pamphlet
was
it
that--
justice
stevens
--and
they
are
in
the
record,
i
gather?
justice
stevens
and
do
they
mention
the
lump-sum
requirements?
justice
stevens
no
mention
of
lump-sum?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
in
the
joint
appendix
at
a-29
there
is
one
pamphlet
and
another
one
at
a-31,
are
those
the
two
she
got?
she
got
both
of
those?
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
other
question
about
the
specific
violation
of
the
regulation
was
that
you
treat
the
lump-sum
as
a
condition
of
eligibility
that
should
have
been
explained,
is
that
right?
the
pamphlets
are
okay
on
coverage
and
scope
of
the
program
but
this
one
condition
of
eligibility
is
not
adequately
explained
or
is
it
that
the
responsibilities
of
the
recipients
are
not
adequately
explained?
justice
stevens
and
here,
she
knew
she
had
to
report
but
she
did
not
know
that
she
had
to
report
before
she
spent
the
money?
justice
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
that
your
case
must
depend
on
the
assumption
that
she
would
have
been
told,
because
then
the
failure
of
her
to
report...
i
mean
telling
her
the
responsibility
would
not
have
done
any
good.
justice
stevens
well,
the
letter
pretty
much
said
that
but
that
it
is
not
in
so
many
words,
i
realize.
but
it
made
it
clear
that
she
could
be
ineligible
for
a
period
of
months,
which
would
be
a
change
from
the
old
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
federal
statute
authorizing
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
the
receipt
by
a
family
of
a
large
lump
sum
a
non
recurring
payment,
such
a
settlement
of
a
personal
injury
case
or
something
like
that,
will
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
family's
eligibility
for
future
payments.
in
this
case
the
respondents
received
such
a
payment
and
they
used
it
to
pay
outstanding
bills
before
they
reported
the
receipt
to
the
case
worker
or
in
charge
of
their
case.
then
they
learned
for
the
first
time
that
their
eligibility
for
future
benefits
had
been
adversely
affected.
they
participated
in
a
federal
action
seeking
a
restoration
of
those
benefits
on
the
ground
that
the
failure
to
tell
them
through
an
adequate
notice
of
the
consequences
of
receipt
of
such
payment
violated
a
regulation
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
requiring
the
recipients
and
applicants
for
sucg
benefits
be
given
adequate
information
about
conditions
of
eligibility.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
regulation
and
granted
respondents
relief.
we
have
reviewed
the
case
and
the
majority
determined
that
regulation
was
not
violated
and
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
which
dissents
in
part
from
our
conclusion
and
she
has
joined
by
justice
brennan
and
partially
by
justice
marshall.
justice
kennedy
has
not
taken
any
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
