let's
assume...
so
it
would
not
make
any
difference
in
your
position
if
the
letter
she
got
when
she
was
a
recipient
was
adequate
notice?
justice
white
so
you
would
say
that
letter
is
just
irrelevant
because
she
should
have
had
another
notice
when
she
reapplied?
justice
white
because
she
got
no
notice
then?
justice
white
but
that
is
the
government
who
came
up
here,
isn't
it?
justice
white
and
they
object
to
more
things
than
just
getting
the
money
back.
justice
white
and
aren't
they
entitled
to,
even
though
there
is
only
one
party
on
the
other
side?
justice
white
but
the
government
is
entitled
to
object
to
that
relief?
justice
white
and
i
don't...
do
you
want
to
defend
it
or
not?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
yes.
