mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court?
congress
has
not
imposed
any
notification
requirements
on
the
secretaries
or
on
the
states,
in
order
to
implement
the
afdc
program.
the
secretary
has
therefore
been
required
to
determine
what
types
of
notice
the
state
should
be
required
to
give
and
whether
the
notices
should
be
uniform
throughout
the
nation.
in
undertaking
that
responsibility,
the
secretary's
scheme
has
three
parts.
first,
applicants,
that
is
a
person
defined
by
the
regulations
who
has
submitted
an
application
and
whose
application
has
not
been
terminated,
must
be
given
information
about
the
basic
outlines
of
the
program.
second,
a
recipient
must
be
told
to
inform
his
or
her
caseworker
about
changes
in
circumstances,
so
that
the
caseworker
can
counsel
that
person
about
the
effect,
if
any,
those
changes
in
circumstances
may
have.
third,
applicants
and
recipients
must
be
given
written
information
explaining
why
an
application
was
rejected
or
benefits
have
been
terminated.
the
secretary's
scheme
leaves
considerable
discretion
to
the
states,
because
the
circumstances
under
which
the
different
afdc
programs
are
implemented,
as
well
as
the
factors
that
are
relevant
to
each
person
will
vary
from
state-to-state
and
from
person-to-person.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
situation
under
which
the
afdc
program
is
implemented,
in
minnesota
is
the
same
as
what
it
is
implemented
like
in
new
york
city.
there
are
a
variety
of
different
factors
that
can
vary
from
place-to-place
or
from
person-to-person.
the
amount
of
income
or
resources
that
individuals
may
have,
whether
individuals
are
receiving
income
or
resources
from
some
other
type
of
social
service
program,
the
number
of
caseworkers
in
a
community,
the
caseload
those
people
may
have,
the
ability
of
a
client
to
reach
a
caseworker's
office
to
discuss
matters
with
him
personally,
and
the
ability
of
people
in
a
particular
locality
to
understand
written
or
spoken
english.
because
these
matters
can
vary
greatly
from
state-to-state,
the
federal
government
las
left
the
states
considerable
latitude
in
deciding
how
best
to
implement
the
information
requirements
of
the
afdc
program.
the
states,
in
turn,
have
to
make
two
judgments.
first,
advance
written
notice
to
beneficiaries,
may
not
be
the
most
effective
way
of
providing
information
about
the
operation
of
the
program.
and
face-to-face
counseling,
counseling
over
the
telephone,
or
other
types
of
circumstances
like
that
may
be
far
more
appropriate.
some
states
may
decide
that
the
best
way
to
to
communicate
information
to
someone
is
after
a
person
has
been
accepted
into
the
program,
to
have
that
person
come
in
for
counseling
and
at
that
time,
have
that
person
told
about
a
variety
of
different
general
obligations
and
also
be
told
that
they
should
report
changes
in
circumstances
to
a
caseworker.
in
other
circumstances,
a
state
may
decide
that
written
information
is
better.
and
different
people
can
differ
as
to
what
is
reasonable.
here,
for
example,
the
affidavits
submitted
by
the
caseworkers
and
other
personnel
who
administer
the
afdc
program
in
minnesota,
which
affidavits
are
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix,
indicate
that
the
affiants
believed
in
their
experience,
the
best
way
to
communicate
the
effect
of
the
program
to
a
person
was
to
tell
a
person
before
or
after,
for
example,
a
lump-sum
had
been
received,
about
how
that
may
or
may
not
affect
his
circumstances.
not
every
one
of
the
different
rules,
including
the
lump-sum
rule,
will
affect
every
person
who
participates
in
the
program.
the
lump-sum
rule
is,
itself,
a
contingency
certain
events
have
to
occur
before
it
affects
anyone.
in
addition,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record,
submitted
in
one
of
the
affidavits
by
petitioner's
state
officials
that
at
least
in
one
county,
that
is
described
as
being
average
in
size,
somewhere
between
only
one
and
five
percent
of
the
people
in
the
program
are
affected
by
the
lump-sum
rule.
it
may
also
be
that
not
everyone
who
receives
a
lump-sum
will
necessarily
have
their
income
reduced
as
a
result.
there
may
be
other
circumstances
that
occurred
during
the
same
period.
for
example,
there
may
be
the
unfortunate
circumstance
that
medical
expenses
might
need
to
be
incurred.
the
result
is,
that
whether
or
not
a
person
receives
a
lump
sum,
can
itself
not
necessarily
affect
the
eligibility
or
continued
eligibility
determination.
in
addition,
states
are
entitled
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
advance
written
notice
might
be
costly
and
every
dollar
spent
on
the
implementation
of
the
program
is
a
dollar
that
can't
be
paid
out
to
beneficiaries.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
let
me
address
that
now.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
right.
there
are
two
answers
to
interrogatories
that
are
relevant
here.
one
shows
up
at
page
a-89,
and
the
other
is
at
page
90
and
91
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
the
first
one
was
89
and
90
to
91.
the
second
answer
we
say,
states
a
considerable
latitude
and
are
not
required
to
publicize
the
lump-sum
rule
in
specially
developed
pamphlets
or
bulletins.
that
is
the
same
phrase
that
shows
up
in
the
subsection
i
regulation
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
in
the
joint
appendix.
no,
well,
the
one
i
just
read
was
from
90
to
91.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
that
is
the
one
on
the
prior
page.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
one
at
90
to
91
says,
for
the
subsection
i
regulation
which
is
at
issue
here,
does
not
require
a
state
to
publicize
the
lump-sum
rule
or
any
other
eligibility
requirements
in
specifically
developed
pamphlets
or
bulletins.
the
term,
specifically
pamphlets
or
bulletins,
is
the
term
that
also
shows
up
in
the
regulations,
subsection
i.
now,
at
the
prior
page,
i
think
the
problem
that
resulted
was
that
the
answer
attempted
to
answer
a
question
by
referring
to
two
regulations,
at
the
very
outset
of
the
answer
at
page
89,
it
refers
to
federal
regulations
at
subsection
i
and
2,
so
that
it
is
talking
about
applicants
and
recipients.
so,
i
think
later
on,
when
the
statement
says,
this
would
generally
include
advising
applicants
and
recipients
of
their
obligation,
if
there
is
a
drafting
error
it
occurred
because
the
sentence
was
read
in
light
of
a
completer
question.
but
it
is
not
the
secretary's
position
that
you
have
to
provide
applicants
with
written
information
about
the
lump-sum
rule.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
then
the
reasons,
those
i
have
explained.
not
every
applicant
will,
of
course,
be
accepted.
and
what
the
secretary
would
like
is
to
have
people
given
information
about
the
basic
outlines
of
the
program.
and
what
the
secretary
also
wants
to
be
sure
is
that
the
material
is
simple
and
understandable
and
is
therefore,
readily
accessible
to
people.
the
secretary,
i
don't
think,
would
believe
that
sending
a
copy
of
all
the
federal
statutes
and
regulations
and
social
security
action
transmittals
and
state
materials,
which
would
in
a
way,
i
suppose,
arguably
satisfy
a
literal
requirement
of
the
rule,
which
is
what
the
eighth
circuit
has,
the
way
the
eighth
circuit
has
read
it,
would
be
very
helpful
to
people.
after
all,
the
material
should
be
simple
and
understandable,
because
the
ability
of
people
to
contact
their
caseworkers
may
differ.
the
basic
assumption
of
the
system
here,
is
that
a
person
will
be
able,
working
with
his
or
her
caseworker,
to
understand
how
the
system
affects
that
person.
the
secretary
has
felt
that
it
believes
that
it
is
not
prudent
to
require
that
all
different
types
of
written
material
be
provided
to
everyone
in
the
program.
the
regulation,
itself,
subsection
i,
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
only
applies
to
applicants.
and
even
in
that
respect,
we
don't
believe
that
applicants
should
be
flooded
with
a
variety
of
materials.
the
secretary's
regulation,
we
believe,
is
designed
to,
or
the
whole
scheme
is
designed
to
afford
people
notice
about
how
this
system
works,
to
help
them
understand
what
happens
when
they
receive
new
income.
giving
them
a
variety
of
notice
in
written
form
may
be
damaging,
because
they
may
not
understand
how
it
works.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions?
