ms.
laurie
n.
davison
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
properly
applied
a
federal
regulation
which
requires
that
certain
information
be
provided
in
written
form.
and
the
regulation
explicitly
requires
that
information
about
conditions
of
eligibility
and
the
responsibilities
of
applicants
and
recipients
of
assistance
be
included
in
that
information.
now,
the
minnesota
welfare
department
does
provide
certain
information
in
written
form.
these
are
the
two
pamphlets
that
are
in
the
joint
appendix,
which
are
given
by
the
welfare
department
to
everyone
who
applies
for
afdc.
if
the
commissioner
had
added
one
or
two
sentences
about
the
lump-sum
rule
in
1981,
or
1982,
or
1983,
or
1984,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
but
for
some
unknown
reason,
the
commissioner
chose
not
to
say
a
word
about
the
lump-sum
rule,
in
any
written
information
given
to
anyone
who
applied
for
afdc
between
october
of
1981,
when
the
lump-sum
statute
went
into
effect
and
july
of
1985,
when
the
commissioner
complied
with
the
district
court's
order
requiring
that
an
explanation
of
the
lump-sum
rule
be
provided.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
ms.
jenkins,
your
honor,
did
tell
the
welfare
department
that
she
was
expecting
a
lump-sum
either
from
social
security
disability
benefits,
or
workers'
compensation
benefits.
the
record
is
clear
on
that
point
and
at
no
point--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
not
correct.
what
the
record
indicates
is
that
she
got
the
lump-sum
on
october
31,
1983,
and
she
was
never
told
that
she
had
to
call
her
worker
before
she
spent
it.
she
was
told
in
writing,
in
this
pamphlet,
that
what
she
had
to
do
was
to
report
it
in
writing
on
the
8th
of
the
following
month,
by
the
8th
of
the
following
month
and
she
did
that.
the
problem
for
ms.
jenkins
is
that
because
she
was
facing
a
mortgage
foreclosure,
she
spent
the
money,
she
paid
her
mortgage
before
calling
her
worker.
but
it
is
also--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--your
honor,
that
is
part
of
what
the
commissioner
is
claiming
and
it
is
part
of
an
attempt
by
the
state
to
paint
ms.
jenkins
as
a
cheat
and
that
is
simply
not
supported
by
the
record.
it
is
true
that
she
received
a
lump-sum
payment
in
december
of
1981,
or
january
of
1982,
when
she
was
a
recipient
of
the
afdc
benefits.
but
she
says
that
she
did
report
it.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
ms.
jenkins
presumably
received
that,
but
she--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--she
got
something
when
she
was
a
recipient,
your
honor,
in
1981.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
she
was
not
a
recipient
for
some
eight
months
in
1982.
she
reapplied,
she
was
an
applicant
for
afdc
benefits
in
november
of
1982,
and
when
she
applied
for
those
benefits
in
1982
she,
like
all
the
other
people
who
applied
for
benefits,
after
the
lump-sum
statute
went
into
effect,
got
no
information
about
the
lump-sum
statute.
now,
the
other
thing
about
ms.
jenkins
is
that
after
getting
the
september
1981
letter
which
did
mention
the
lump
sum
statute,
she
got
a
lump-sum
and
when
she...
and
then
went
off
assistance
because
her
husband's
workmens'
compensation
made
the
family
ineligible
for
welfare.
when
she
reapplied
for
afdc
benefits
in
november
of
1982,
she
was
asked
to
verify
how
that
lump-sum,
the
1981-1982
lump-sum
was
spent,
she
provided
that
verification
and
she
was
found
eligible.
that
lump-sum,
despite
that
september
1981
notice
was
treated
under
the
prior
lump-sum
statute.
and
so
she
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
rule
was
as
it
had
been
in
the
past...
that
she
could
receive
lump-sum
income,
spend
it,
report
it,
verify
the
expenses
and
then
that
lump-sum
would
have
no
effect
on
her
future
eligibility
for
assistance.
but
the
key
is
that
she
was
an
applicant
in
1982
and
was
given
no
information
about
that.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
she
had
been
off
the
rolls
for
eight
months.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
she
was
a
recipient
in
september
of
1981.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
she
got
the
september
letter.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
she
was
on
notice
in
september
of
1981.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
but
then
she
got
a
lump-sum
that
was
treated
not
under
the
old
lump-sum
rule,
it
was
not
treated
under
the
new
lump-sum
statute.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
in
september
of
1981
she
got
the
september
letter.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
and
in
either
december
of
1981
or
january
of
1982
she
got
a
lump-sum
that
was
treated
when
she
reapplied
in
november
of
1982,
eight
months
later,
it
was
treated,
that
previous
lump-sum
was
treated
as
income
in
the
month
received
and
a
resource
thereafter
that
did
not
affect
her
future
eligibility
for
afdc.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
exactly,
exactly
and
the
state
did
nothing
to
tell--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--for
years
the
program
has
required--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--and
she
did.
she
reported
her
lump-sum
on
a
timely
basis.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
the
first
lump-sum
is
not
at
issue.
the
reason
that
there
is
a...
justice
o'connor
asked
about
whether,
about
the
$16,000
lump-sum
payment,
and
there
is
no
finding
of
fact
by
the
district
court
on
whether
or
not
she
reported
that
lump-sum
because
it
was
not
relevant
to
this
case.
she
was
a
new
applicant
in
november
of
1982,
and
got
no
information
about
the
lump-sum
rule.
she--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--she
did
not
know
anything
about
the
new
rule.
she
was
not
told
that
the
law
had
changed.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
she
was
told
in
september
of
1981
that
the
law
had
changed.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
that
letter
also
said
that
this
is
based
on
current
information
and
we
may
change
our
minds.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
but
she
was
told
in
november
of
1981
that
there
was
some
change
but
her
experience
after
receiving
that
letter
told
her
and
would
have
told
anyone
that
you
could
spend
your
lump-sum
income
on
debts,
report
it,
verify
it,
and
you
would
be
eligible--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--no.
she
received
a
lump-sum
in
october
of
1983,
a
year
after
she
applied
for
benefits.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
it
was
reported,
it
was
reported
two
days
after
she
received
it.
she
was
told
in
writing--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--she
had
eight
days,
she
had
10
days
to
report
it,
or
eight
days
to...
excuse
me,
or
she
had
until
eight
days
into
the
following
month
to
report
it.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
exactly.
and
the
welfare
department
knew
that
she
was
expecting
a
workers'
compensation
check
or
a
social
security
disability
check
and
yet,
even
with
that
knowledge,
they
told
her
nothing
about
her
obligations
under
the
statute
to
budget
and
use
that
money
to
pay
for
her
family's
ordinary
living
expenses.
what
the
district
court
did
here
is
to
say
to
the
commissioner,
commissioner
you
violated
the
regulation,
correct
that
violation.
that
was
the
sum
total
of
the
burden
imposed
by
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
what
this
case
is
not
about.
the
court
did
not
enjoin
implementation
of
the
lump-sum
statute.
the
court
did
not
hold
that
any
class
member
was
eligible
for
benefits
because
they
did
not
get
an
explanation
from
some
statute.
we
are
not
arguing
that
an
explanation
of
the
statute
was
a
condition
precedent
to
the
application
of
the
lump-sum
statute.
that
is
not
our
position.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor,
that
is
not
what
the
court
required.
kathryn
jenkins
got
afdc
benefits
during
her
period
of
ineligibility.
not
because
of
anything
that
the
district
court
did,
but
because
she
filed
an
administrative
appeal
and
federal
regulations
require
that
you
get
continued
benefits
pending
an
administrative
appeal
decision.
what
the
district
court
did,
or
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
was
conclude
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
law,
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
regulation
that
required
an
explanation
of
the
lump-sum
statute.
and
that
given
that
violation,
the
court
had
the
authority
to
fashion
a
remedy
for
kathryn
jenkins
and
the
remedy
that
was
fashioned
was
an
injunction
against
the
state
recovering
a
$5,000
overpayment.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
that
is
right.
it
was
an
overpayment.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
make
clear,
judge
arnold
did
not
make
clear
the
basis
for
that
order.
to
the
extent
that
the
opinion
suggests
that
the
basis
for
that
equitable
order
is
that
the
statute
did
not
take
effect
and
we
disavow
that
position.
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
has
traditional
equitable
powers
to
fashion
remedy
when
there
has
been
a
violation
of
law,
and
there
was
a
violation
of
law
in
this
case.
that
there
is
no
statute
that--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--the
regulation,
that
is
right.
there
is
nothing,
there
is
no
statute
which
deprives
the
court
of
the
equitable
power
to
fashion
a
remedy
and
the
court
properly
exercised
its
discretion
in
fashioning
the
remedy.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
there
is,
your
honor,
a
statute
which
governs
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
it
says
that
if
a
state
wants
to
get
federal
funds
in
the
administration
of
its
afdc
program,
that
the
state
must
have
in
its
state
plan
a
provision
that
overpayments
will
be
recovered.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
but
that
statute
does
not
purport
either
in
expressed
or
implicit
terms
to
limit
the
traditional
equitable
powers
of
the
federal
court.
and
as
this
court
ruled
in
heckler
v.
day,
even
the
court
in
heckler
v.
day
found
that
it
was
clear
from
congressional
history
that
congress
did
not
want
a
court
to
impose
time
limits
on
the
secretary
in
deciding
social
security
benefits,
but
that
the
court,
in
a
footnote
said,
despite
our
conclusion,
nothing
in
this
decision
limits
a
federal
court
from
applying
equitable
principles
in
an
individual
case,
to
apply
time
limits
in
an
individual
case
and
to
award
benefits
if
the
time
limits
are
not
kept.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
well,
your
honor,
in
goldberg
v.
kelly
the
court
said
that
there
must
be
a
right
to
a
due
process
hearing
before
benefits
are
terminated.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
that
is
a
constitutional
case,
your
honor.
but
nonetheless,
some
of
those
people
would
not
have
been
eligible
for
benefits
and
at
the
time,
there
was
no
provision
for
recovering
overpayments
when
the
overpayment
was
caused
not
by
the
client
error.
and
so,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
happened
in
that
case
is
that
people
who
may
not
have
been
eligible
were
awarded
benefits.
that
is
the
closest
analogy
that
i
can
come
up
with.
there
may
be
other
cases,
your
honor,
but
i
am
not
aware
of
them.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
no,
because
the
secretary's
regulation
says
that
the
information
must
be
provided
in
writing
and
orally
as
appropriate.
if
the
secretary--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--if
there
is
any
ambiguity,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
about
what
information
has
to
be
provided
but
not
whether
it
has
to
be
in
writing
or
whether
it
can
be
simply
oral
information.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
so
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
has
to
be
in
writing,
i
think,
has
to
be
answered
in
the
affirmative.
it
has
to
be
because
that
is
what
the
secretary
said.
now,
if
the
secretary,
in
his
judgment,
feels
that
as
a
policy
matter
it
is
more
effective
to
impart
information
orally
than
in
writing,
the
secretary
is
free
to
amend
that
regulation.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
that
is
right,
two
pamphlets.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
they
are
in
the
record,
in
the
joint
appendix.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
not
a
word.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
no
mention.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
that
is
right,
but
she
got
nothing
at
the
time
that
she
was
an
applicant.
it--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
that
letter
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the
claim
the
plaintiff
and
her
class
as
to
whether
the
regulation
was
violated.
it
is
not
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
balancing
of
the
equities
and
fashioning
relief
to
the
plaintiff
jenkins.
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
have
considered
the
fact
that
she
had
gotten
this
notice,
just
as
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
consider
the
fact
that
she
got
a
lump-sum
after
that,
which
was
treated
under
the
old
rule,
not
the
new
rule.
but
her
rights
were
violated
as
an
applicant,
as
were
the
other
class
members.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
because
she
got
no
notice
then,
even
though
the
welfare
department
knew
that
she
was
anticipating
the
receipt
of
a
social
security
check
or
workers'
compensation
check.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
she
got
both
of
those.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
and
it
is
not
true
as
mr.
kirwin
suggested
that
these
pamphlets
only
explain
eligibility
which
are
applicable
to
everyone
on
the
program.
one
of
the
eligibility
requirements
explained
in
the
pamphlet,
i
think
it
is
a-29,
is
that
you,
one
of
the
child's
parents
has
to
have
an
illness
which
lasts
at
least
30
days.
that
is
an
eligibility
requirement
for
benefits
under
the
afdc
program
for
families
who
are
incapacitated
or
one
member
is
incapacitated.
and
they
are
less
than
2
percent
or
about
2
percent
of
the
entire
afdc
population
on
that
particular
program.
the
lump-sum
rule
is
applicable
across
the
board
in
the
same
way
that
this
is
applicable
across
the
board.
it
only
affects
people
who
have
an
incapacitated
parent.
the
lump-sum
rule
only
affects
people
who
happen
to
receive
lump-sum
income.
but
it
only
has
direct
implication
for
a
relatively
small
percentage
of
the
afdc
population.
if
there
is
any
eligibility
condition
that
has
to
be
explained
to
people,
it
is
the
lump-sum
rule.
it
is
not
a
case,
this
is
not
a
case
about
some
abstract
interest
in
information.
when
congress
enacted
the
lump-sum
statute,
it
was
for
the
express
purpose
of
imposing
the
responsibility
on
afdc
recipients
of
budgeting
lump-sum
income
and
to
use
it
on
ordinary
living
expenses
in
lieu
of
afdc.
now,
that
simply
is
not
going
to
happen
unless
people
know
of
that
responsibility.
and
afdc
recipients
even
in
minnesota
live
substantially
below
the
poverty
level.
they
are
bound
to
be
under
substantial
financial
pressure
to
spend
lump-sum
income
quickly.
and
telling
them
about
their
responsibilities
and
about
the
fact
that
they
are
going
to
be
ineligible
for
afdc
for
a
number
of
months,
at
the
time
of
termination
is
simply
too
late.
that
may
be
a
month
after
the
family
got
the
lump-sum
income.
it
is
especially
unfair
to
somebody
like
kathryn
jenkins
and
other
people
who
had
reason
to
believe
that
they
could
spend
lump-sum
income
on
legitimate
debts
and
that
it
would
not
affect
their
future
eligibility
for
assistance.
and
the
commissioner
agreed,
excuse
me,
the
secretary
agreed
in
answers
to
interrogatories
that
the
operation
of
the
lump-sum
statute
had
to
be
explained.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
but
we
have
here,
a
federal
regulation
which
says
that
you
do
tell
people
about
the
eligibility
conditions,
you
do
tell
them
what
their
responsibilities
are.
and
this
is
clearly
a
responsibility.
that
is
what
the
secretary
said
to
congress
and
that
is
what
the
secretary
said
in
regulations
implemented
in
the
lump-sum
statute.
this
is
a
responsibility
of
caretakers.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
that
is
right.
no,
i
think
you
don't
have
to
agree
with
me
that
applicants
and
recipients
mean
the
same
thing.
the
whole
issue
about
whether
the
regulation
applies
to
recipients
as
well
as
applicants
is
really
a
very
narrow
issue
and
affects
only
a
very
minor
part
of
this
case.
the
district
court
ordered
that
a
explanation
of
the
lump-sum
statute
be
given
to
people
who
were
then
recipients
of
afdc
because
as
applicants
they
had
not
gotten
any
information.
that
was
accomplished
in
november
of
1985
and
is
moot.
the
court
ordered
that
new
applicants
be
given
this
explanation
at
the
time
of
application
and
the
applicant/recipient
argument
would
not
affect
that
relief.
the
court
also
argued
that
the
explanation
be
given
every
six
months,
at
the
time
of
redetermination.
what
this
whole
argument
boils
down
to--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--that
is
right.
i
would
also
like
to
make
clear
as
to
the
question
about
the
named
plaintiff
and
the
standing
of
the
named
plaintiff,
and
her
adequacy
as
a
class
representative,
is
that
there
are
other
class
members.
if
she
is
not
an
adequate
class
representative,
then
the
case
could
have
been
remanded
for
the
substitution
of
a
different
plaintiff.
so
that
even
if
the
court
feels
that
the
september
1981
notice
affects
her
standing,
then
it
should
have
been
remanded
for
someone
else
to
intervene
on
behalf
of
the
class.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
recipients
are
entitled
to
benefits
boils
down
to
whether
the
state
is
required
to
send
one
piece
of
paper
which
is
already
prepared
to
people
who
are
already
getting
information
at
their
six
month
eligibility
determination
so
that
it
is
really
a
very
minor
issue
in
the
case.
and
since
the
commissioner
never
made
this
argument
to
the
district
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
certainly
can
be
affirmed
as
an
appropriate
form
of
relief.
they
never
claimed
that
there
was
any
burden
and
there
certainly
isn't
any
burden.
now,
the
commissioner--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--that
is
right.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
whichever
is
shorter.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
that
is
right.
and
the
first
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
the
secretary
says
it
has
to
be
in
writing,
but
i
agree
with
the
secretary's
determination
because
the
system
works
on
written
communication,
that
is
how
it
is
set
up.
and
it
is
not
adequate
to
wait
until
the
information
is
reported
and
it
is
reported
in
writing
by
the
8th
of
the
following
month.
and
then
the
welfare
department
only
has
to
send
a
termination
notice
10
days
before
the
end
of,
10
days
before
the
beginning
of
the
following
month.
so,
a
lot
of
time
can
elapse.
and
it
is
also
very
difficult
to
reach
your
financial
worker.
very
often
the
phone
is
busy
and
people
don't
have
telephones.
the
system,
unlike
the
previous
case,
which
did
not
reflect
the
real
world,
this
case
does
reflect
the
real
world,
and
in
the
real
world
of
the
welfare
department,
welfare
administration,
it
makes
sense
to
require
that
this
information
be
provided
in
writing.
the
commissioner
complains
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
left
too
many
unanswered
questions
about
the
scope
and
applicability
of
this
federal
regulation.
if
the
court
had
written
a
broad
decision
trying
to
anticipate
all
of
the
questions
that
might
arise,
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
regulation,
and
answered
those
questions,
then
the
commissioner
would
have
a
valid
basis
for
complaining
that
as
the
commissioner
does
complain,
that
the
court
over
stepped
its
judicial
bounds,
and
interfered
with
the
administration
of
the
welfare
department.
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
judge
arnold
answered
the
questions
that
were
raised
by
the
complaint
in
a
reasoned
and
principled
manner
and
if
there
are
questions
that
require
answers,
the
answers
should
be
provided
by
the
secretary.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
i
think
it
is
both,
because
the
lump-sum
rule,
unlike
the
vast
majority
of
other
rules,
is
not
only
a
condition
of
eligibility
but
also
in
order
to
effectuate
congress'
intent,
imposes
responsibilities
on
welfare
recipients.
and
that
is
one
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
narrowed
its
decision
and
this
court
could,
too,
that
not
all
eligibility
requirements
impose
responsibilities
on
recipients
to
take
affirmative
action.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
that
is
right.
and
she
did
not
know,
even
if
she
had
reported,
before
she
spent
the
money,
she
may
or
may
not
have
been
told,
right
then,
what
she
could
do
with
it.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
what
we
think
she
should
have
been
told
under
the
federal
regulation
is,
in
one
sentence
as
this
court
indicated
in
lukhard,
the
lump-sum
rule
requires
that
if
you
receive
lump-sum
income
you
will
be
rendered
ineligible
for
the
number
of
months
that
it
would
take
you
to
use
the
lump-sum
spending
each
month
no
more
than
your
welfare
grant.
that
is
what
she
was
required
under
the
regulation
to
be
told.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
if
they
had
given
her
this
letter,
that
letter,
in
november
of
1982,
or
given
that
letter
to
anybody
who
applied
for
afdc
benefits,
any
time
between
the
implementation
of
the
lump-sum
statute,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
they
did
not
give
that
letter
to
anyone
other
than
people
who
were
then
recipients
in
september
of
1981.
they
did
not
give
it
to
her
and
they
did
not
give
it
to
the
200,000
families
who
applied
for
benefits.
this
court
doesn't
have
to
judge
the
adequacy
of
that
letter.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
absolutely.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
no,
but
she
was
then,
and
she
continues
to
be
a
recipient
and
as
i
understand
standing,
it
is
a
threshold
question.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
she
is
a
representative
of
the
class
and
the
class
is
an
ongoing
class
of
people
who
apply.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
the
government
petitioned
for
cert,
yes.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
they
object--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
justice
white.
there,
i
think
the
ongoing
relief
that
was
ordered,
it
is
certainly
not
moot
and
there
is
a
class--
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
--absolutely.
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
to
the
relief?
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
to
the
relief
for
the
class?
ms.
laurie
n.
davison
absolutely.
to
the
relief
of
kathryn
jenkins,
yes,
but
not
on
the
basis
that
she
was
eligible
for
benefits,
rather
on
the
basis
that
the
court
had
the
equitable
power
to
fashion
a
remedy
and
that
the
exercise
of
that
equitable
power
was
not
an
abuse
of
an
abuse
of
discretion.
