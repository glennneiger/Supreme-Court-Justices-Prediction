justice
scalia
this
is
a-89,
you
say?
justice
scalia
of
course,
the
particular
plaintiff
here,
if
she
had
contacted
her
caseworker,
as
she
was
supposed
to,
would
have
presumably
been
advised
of
the
rule
by
her
caseworker.
justice
scalia
i
thought
that
the
record
was
clear
that
she
did
not
report
the
lump-sum
payment
to
her
caseworker
as
she
was
supposed
to.
justice
scalia
ms.
davison,
the
statute
not
only
deprived
her
of
eligibility
but
there
is
also
an
explicit
provision
in
the
statute
requiring
recoupment
of
overpayments,
isn't
there?
the
court,
in
effect,
fashioned
a
remedy
that
overrode
that
provision.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
i
have
tried
to
think
of
an
analog
of
some
other
case
i
could
come
up
with
where
the
court
has
fashioned
a
remedy
that
specifically
allows
somebody
to
do
something
which
a
statute
prohibits.
and
i
can't
think
of
one,
can
you?
and
i
did
not
see
any
in
your
brief.
do
you
know
any
other
example,
where
a
court
has
said,
because
somebody
has
violated
a
regulation
or
because
of
some
other
rule,
we
are
going
to
say
you
can
ignore
the
statute?
justice
scalia
of
course
most
people
don't
get
explanations
of
changes
in
law.
i
mean,
there
have
been
massive
changes
in
the
internal
revenue
code
for
example
and
my
friendly
revenue
agent
has
not
advised
me
what
changes
there
are
going
to
be.
now,
to
be
sure,
that
just
applies
to
matters
that
are
not
as
crucial
as
getting
subsistence
payments,
but
nonetheless,
it
is
the
principle
of
our
law
that
it
is
up
to
you
to
find
out
what
your
entitlements
are.
justice
scalia
do
we
have
to
agree
with
you
that
applicant
and
recipient
are
one
and
the
same
in
order
to
agree
with
you
about
the
regulation?
or
is
part
of
your
claim
that
she
did
not
get
a
notice
when
she
was
a
new
applicant
is
that--
justice
scalia
--that
does
not
affect
the
one
remaining
named
plaintiff,
anyway?
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
i
gather
that
your
point
is
that
the
requirement
for
oral
consultation
is
not
adequate
because
you
are
not
required
to
contact
your
caseworker
immediately
upon
receiving
the
lump-sum
payment,
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
so
that
between
the
time
you
receive
it
and
the
8th
of
the
next
month,
or
10
days,
whichever
is
longer
is
that--
justice
scalia
--whichever
is
shorter,
you
can
blow
the
whole
thing
and
then
it
is
too
late.
justice
scalia
ms.
davison,
suppose
that
i
disagree
with
you
that
the
court
can
give,
can
prevent
the
requirement
that
she
give
the
money
back?
could
i
nonetheless
uphold
the
rest
of
the
relief
that
the
court
gave?
i
mean
the,
in
particular,
the
mandate
that
this
information
be
included?
justice
scalia
how
can
i
do
that
though,
because
who
would
have
had
standing?
she
certainly
does
not
have
standing
to
get
that
relief.
that
relief
does
her
no
good.
she
is
already,
you
know,
she
is
not
an
applicant
any
more,
she
is
on
the
program.
justice
scalia
well,
the
relief
has
to
benefit
the
individual
that
is
suing
and
i
don't
see
how
this
relief,
other
than
the
monetary
relief
does
her
a
bit
of
good.
