mr.
john
l.
kirwin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
case
involves
minnesota's
operation
of
the
afdc
program.
there
are
two
issues
raised
by
this
case.
first,
does
an
applicant
publicity
regulation
of
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
require
a
state
to
single
out
one
of
the
myriad
eligibility
requirements
of
the
afdc
program?
and
require
a
state
to
give
repeated,
detailed,
written
notice
of
that
one
requirement
to
all
applicants
and
recipients?
minnesota
and
the
secretary
argue
that
the
secretary's
regulations
requires
states
to
generally
publicize
the
afdc
program
and
its
eligibility
requirements
to
applicants.
the
second
issue
is
equally
significant
to
minnesota
and
to
other
states.
can
a
court
apply
an
information
regulation
of
the
secretary
in
a
way
that
effectively
modifies
congress'
eligibility
requirements?
can
the
court
require
the
state
to
pay
afdc
benefits
to
a
person
who
is
without
dispute
ineligible
to
receive
those
benefits
under
congress'
eligibility
statute?
a
divided
panel
of
the
eighth
circuit
required
the
state
to
pay
such
benefits
to
an
ineligible
person.
and
enjoined
the
state
from
recovering
over-payments
made
to
that
ineligible
person
even
though
congress
had
expressly
required
states
to
recover
all
afdc
over-payments.
the
eighth
circuit
essentially
read
the
secretary's
information
regulation
as
modifying
the
statutory
eligibility
requirement.
and
also
the
statutory
recoupment
requirement.
the
secretary
doesn't
interpret
his
own
regulation
in
that
way
and
the
regulation
couldn't
be
interpreted
to
modify
the
statutory
requirements.
that
would
be
beyond
the
secretary's
authority.
the
specific
eligibility
requirement
involved
in
this
case
is
the
1981
lump-sum
statute.
as
the
court
will
recall
from
the
lukhard
case,
which
was
decided
last
term,
the
lump-sum
statute
provides
that
when
an
afdc
family
receives
an
amount
of
non-recurring
income
greater
than
its
monthly
afdc
grant,
the
family
will
be
ineligible
for
afdc
for
one
or
more
months,
depending
on
the
size
of
the
lump-sum
payment
and
the
amount
of
the
monthly
grant.
immediately
after
the
passage
of
the
lump-sum
statute,
which
was
part
of
the
omnibus
budge
reconciliation
act
of
1981,
minnesota
distributed
a
letter
to
all
persons
who
were
receiving
afdc
in
minnesota
at
that
time.
the
letter
told
them
about
certain
of
the
obra
changes.
now,
there
were
many,
many
obra
changes
to
the
afdc
program
and
minnesota's
letter
picked
out
19
of
the
changes
that
minnesota
thought
were
the
most
important.
one
of
those
was
the
lump-sum
statute.
minnesota
sent
that
letter
simply
to
assist
its
afdc
recipients
and
minnesota
had
never
had
the
understanding
under
the
federal
regulation
that
it
was
required
to
provide
advance
publicity
to
recipients
that
congress
had
changed
eligibility
requirements.
apart
from
the
1981
letter,
minnesota's
general
program
of
providing
information
to
applicants
and
recipients
is
accomplished
primarily
in
two
ways.
first,
minnesota
provides
a
pamphlet
for
afdc
applicants
which
provides
general
information
about
eligibility
requirements
and
other
aspects
of
the
afdc
program.
the
pamphlet
includes
descriptions
of
those
eligibility
requirements
which
apply
to
every
afdc
applicant
and
recipient
and
which
form
the
framework
of
the
afdc
program.
the
pamphlet
provides
specific
information
regarding
the
eligibility
requirements
which
relate
to
age
of
children,
statutory
reason
for
deprivation
of
parental
support,
the
two
different
kinds
of
income
limits,
the
resource
limits
of
the
program,
the
requirements
to
participate
in
work
programs
and
in
recovery
of
child
support.
and
the
pamphlet
tells
applicants
that
it
does
not
cover
all
the
afdc
rules,
that
those
rules
change
and
that
applicants
should
consult
with
their
caseworkers
concerning
the
more
specific
requirements
of
the
afdc
program.
second,
in
addition
to
this
pamphlet,
minnesota
provides
a
caseworker
to
each
applicant
and
recipient
to
consult
with
that
person
concerning
the
specifics
of
the
afdc
program.
now,
in
addition
to
those
information
sources,
every
applicant
and
recipient
knows,
based
on
their
participation
in
the
program,
on
their
completion
of
the
application
forms
and
other
periodic
forms
on
which
they
have
to
report
in
minute
detail
their
income
and
resources
and
family
living
situations,
applicants
and
recipients
know
that
almost
any
change
in
their
financial
situation
affects
their
afdc
eligibility.
as
a
general
matter,
the
secretary
and
the
state
have
determined,
based
on
their
experience
in
operating
the
afdc
program,
that
a
lengthy
written
explanation
of
eligibility
requirements
is
less
helpful
to
applicants
or
recipients
than
an
individualized
oral
discussion
at
a
time
when
the
eligibility
requirement
is
meaningful
to
the
recipient.
in
1984,
two
and
a
half
years
after
the
obra
changes
became
effective,
the
named
plaintiff,
kathryn
jenkins,
intervened
in
a
pending
federal
court
lawsuit.
and
jenkins
claimed
that
minnesota
was
required
to
give
specific,
detailed,
periodic,
written
notice
to
every
applicant
and
recipient
concerning
only
one
requirement
of
the
afdc
program,
the
lump-sum
statute;
a
statute
which
affects
really
a
small
percentage
of
the
recipients
in
the
afdc
program.
the
lower
courts
agreed
with
jenkins'
argument
and
they
ordered
the
state
to
provide
that
kind
of
notice.
and
the
court
held
that
minnesota's
1981
letter
which
included
an
explanation
of
the
lump
sum
statute,
and
which
jenkins
had
received,
hadn't
been
specific
enough
in
describing
the
lump-sum
statute.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
it
was
judge
mclaughlin
justice
blackman.
the
lower
court,
we
believe,
seriously
misconstrued
the
secretary's
regulation.
what
does
the
regulation
require?
this
is
not
a
regulation
that
requires
detailed
notice
of
every
eligibility
requirement
or
even
of
any
specific
eligibility
requirement.
the
regulation
says
that
applicants
shall
be
given
information
in
writing
and
orally
as
appropriate
about
various
aspects
of
the
program.
in
addition
to
eligibility
requirements,
the
state
has
to
describe
program
coverage,
scope
of
the
program,
other
services
available,
appeal
rights,
and
other
rights
and
responsibilities.
and
the
regulation
requires
that
the
state
provide
simple
pamphlets
or
bulletins
containing
information
about
the
program.
the
state
and
the
secretary
agree
with
judge
fagg's
interpretation
of
the
regulation.
judge
fagg
who
dissented
in
the
court
of
appeals,
said
that
the
regulations
simply
requires
the
state
to
publicize
generally
in
written
form
and
orally
as
appropriate
the
afdc
program
and
its
availability.
the
8th
circuit
tried
to
turn
the
regulation
into
something
completely
different
from
that.
the
lower
court
held
that
the
regulation
requires
notice
of
a
specific
eligibility
requirement
that
the
lower
court
felt
was
a
particularly
important
requirement.
the
court
held
that
the
regulation
requires
that
information
be
provided
to
applicants
despite
the
fact
that
the
regulation
only...
excuse
me...
to
recipients
despite
the
fact
that
the
regulation
talks
only
of
applicants
and
it
required
that
the
notice
be
given
periodically.
the
court
held
that
the
notice
must
include
a
detailed
description
of
the
mechanics
of
an
eligibility
rule,
including
examples
of
the
rules
operation.
none
of
those
requirements
is
based
on
any
standard
contained
in
the
regulation.
the
court
simply
constructed
those
requirements
on
its
own.
under
the
8th
circuit's
decision,
a
state
can
never
know,
until
after
the
fact,
whether
it
is
given
enough
information
or
whether
it
has
effectively
implemented
a
provision
of
the
afdc
program.
the
8th
circuit
singled
out
this
one
eligibility
requirement
for
this
type
of
notice.
the
lower
court's
decision
can
be
read
to
require
that
kind
of
notice
about
every
eligibility
requirement,
although
it
is
not
completely
clear.
that
would
be
virtually
impossible
to
do
and
even
if
it
could
be
done,
it
would
be
virtually
useless
to
applicants
or
recipients
to
overwhelm
them
with
that
volume
of
information.
the
plaintiffs
argue
that
while
the
lower
court
didn't
require
this
type
of
notice
concerning
every
eligibility
requirement,
but
that
the
lower
court's
decision
is
not
necessarily
limited
to
the
lump-sum
statute
either.
that
there
may
be
other
eligibility
requirements,
as
yet
unidentified,
about
which
the
state
has
to
give
that
kind
of
notice.
but
when
you
look
at
what
happened
in
this
case,
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
those
kinds
of
gray
areas
make
the
situation
so
administratively
unworkable
for
minnesota
and
the
other
states.
in
1981,
there
was
nothing
in
the
regulation
or
in
any
interpretation
of
the
secretary
which
would
have
informed
minnesota
that
it
was
even
required
by
law
to
distribute
the
informational
letter
or
that
it
was
required
to
single
out
one
provision
of
the
afdc
program,
the
lump-sum
statute,
for
specialized
treatment
in
that
letter.
and
in
its
afdc
pamphlet,
minnesota
had
no
way
of
knowing,
based
on
the
language
of
the
federal
regulation
or
any
interpretation
of
the
secretary,
that
even
though
not
every
eligibility
requirement
had
to
be
described,
the
lump-sum
statute
did
have
to
be
described
and
in
great
detail.
under
the
8th
circuit's
decision,
a
state
has
to
guess
about
what
information
is
required,
and
about
which
eligibility
requirements
have
to
be
described.
and
if
a
state
predicts
wrong,
if
a
federal
court
later
disagrees
with
the
state's
considered
judgment,
based
on
its
experience,
then
the
state's
implementation
of
the
eligibility
requirement
is
set
aside
for
the
past
months,
or
even
years,
as
occurred
in
this
case.
even
if
the
8th
circuit
was
correct
in
its
holding
that
minnesota
was
required
to
provide
more
information,
the
court's
remedy
here
was
certainly
improper.
because
kathryn
jenkins
had
appealed
the
termination
of
her
benefits,
she
received
continued
benefits
during
that
appeal
process
and
when
the
appeal
was
resolved,
the
county
agency
notified
jenkins
that
it
would
recoup
the
overpayment
that
had
been
made
to
her
by
withholding
one
percent
of
her
monthly
afdc
grant.
the
8th
circuit
enjoined
minnesota
from
recouping
the
overpayment
made
to
jenkins.
the
court
said
that
since
minnesota
had
not
provided
enough
information
concerning
this
lump-sum
statute,
the
state
had
not
effectively
implemented
the
statute.
and
that
jenkins
was
not
subject
to
the
statute,
subject
to
the
eligibility
condition
established
by
congress.
the
lower
court
ordered
that
jenkins
was
entitled
to
receive
and
to
retain
afdc
benefits,
even
though
congress
had
expressly
said
otherwise.
in
the
lump-sum
statute,
of
course,
congress
had
said
that
when
an
afdc
recipient
received
a
certain
amount
of
income,
the
recipient
would
be
ineligible
for
a
fixed
period
of
time.
and
congress
did
not
provide
that
if
the
state
did
not
provide
advance
information
concerning
the
requirement,
that
it
did
not
become
effective
and
that
people
weren't
subject
to
it.
and
in
another
of
the
1981
obra
changes,
congress
said
that
if
any
recipient
received
more
benefits
than
he
or
she
was
entitled
to
receive,
the
state
was
required
to
recoup
that
overpayment
of
benefits.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
plaintiffs
have
conceded
that
and
the
lower
court
found
that.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
in
september
of
1981.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
it
did,
justice
o'connor.
in
fact,
it
included
quite
a
bit
of
information
about
the
lump-sum
statute.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
if
written
notice
was
required.
in
addition
to
that--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--your
honor,
i
am
not
certain
if
that
statement
would
have
been
made
in
answer
to
interrogatories.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
what
respondents
were
referring
to,
was
the
answers
to
interrogatories
by
the
secretary.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
i
would--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
a
party
can
be
asked
to
state
its
position
concerning
legal
issues
in
interrogatories.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
interrogatories
were
served
on
the
secretary
and
the
secretary's
responses,
we
believe,
were
quite
confusing.
in
fact,
the
two
lower
courts
disagreed
on
which
side
the
secretary
was
on,
on
this
issue.
the
secretary
agrees
in
this
case,
though,
that
his
information
regulation
that
we
have
been
talking
about
doesn't
provide
that
if
information
isn't
given,
the
eligibility
conditions
won't
be
applied.
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
cases
that
courts
can't
order
the
benefits
be
paid
out
contrary
to
the
conditions
set
by
congress
for
the
receipt
of
those
benefits,
to
remedy
mistakes
made
by
government
agents.
even
where
government
agents
have
provided
mis-information,
as
in
fcic
v.
merrill
or
schweiker
v.
hansen,
this
court
nonetheless,
has
said
that
congress
has
established
the
conditions
upon
which
those
monies
can
be
paid
out.
an
administrative
mistake
simply
doesn't
create
an
entitlement
to
benefits
where
a
person
doesn't
meet
congress'
eligibility
requirements.
that
doesn't
mean
that
a
court
is
without
any
authority
to
remedy
a
state's
failure
to
comply
with
an
information
regulation
if
that
kind
of
obligation
exists
here.
certainly
the
court
could
enjoin
the
state
to
provide
the
required
information
in
the
future.
but
this
court
has
never
gone
so
far
as
to
order
that
the
benefits
be
provided
to
a
person
who
doesn't
meet
those
substantive
eligibility
requirements.
we
believe
that
the
lower
court
both
misapplied
the
secretary's
information
regulation
and
that
it
granted
a
remedy
which
was
expressly
precluded
by
federal
law
and
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
8th
circuit.
and,
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
before
1985,
your
honor,
for
the
period
from
1981
to
1985.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
okay,
applicants
weren't
given
any
written
information
concerning
the
lump-sum
rule
with
this
exception:
that
applicants
filled
out
the
application
form,
filled
out
the
forms
for
redetermination
of
eligibility
and
there
are
some
examples
of
those
in
the
joint
appendix.
they
are
missing
$16,000
that
was
not
reported
on
the
forms
that
called
for
it.
those
forms
specifically
listed
lump-sum
income
and
so
that
applicants
knew,
even
though
they
may
not
have
known
precisely
how
it
would
be
treated,
they
certainly
knew
that
lump-sum
income
was
something
that
had
some
bearing
on
their
afdc
eligibility.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
that
is
correct.
no
information
other
than
the
forms
that--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--concerning
the
lump-sum
statute?
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
we
very
strongly
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
the
plaintiffs,
the
respondents
in
their
brief,
concede
that
the
regulation
doesn't
require
that
descriptions
be
given
of
all
eligibility
requirements.
they
say
that
and
they
say
that
the
lower
court
did
not
say
that.
but
they
say
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
that
there
is
something
special
about
the
lump-sum
statute.
the
lump-sum
statute
certainly
has
an
impact
on
those
families
that
are
affected
by
it.
other
eligibility
requirements
have
an
impact
on
the
families
that
are
affected
by
them.
the
important
thing
is
that
the
secretary--
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
is
what
the
secretary
said.
mr.
john
l.
kirwin
well,
mr.
larkin,
i
think
has
explained
that
and
i
was
perhaps
too
glib
before
in
saying
that
the
answers
were
confusing.
i
think
to
an
extent
they
were
but
it
was
because
the
secretary
tried
to
describe
obligations
under
two
different
regulations
at
one
time.
i
would
like
to
make
a
brief
comment
about
the
remedy
issue
and
the
limitations
on
the
lower
court's
authority
to
grant
a
remedy.
i
think
respondents
are
unclear
as
to
what
it
was
that
the
lower
court
said.
i
see
that
