justice
o'connor
mr.
kirwin,
is
the
only
named
plaintiff
in
this
action
with
standing
to
assert
the
notice
issue,
kathryn
jenkins?
justice
o'connor
and
a
letter
was
given
to
ms.
jenkins
when,
september?
justice
o'connor
of
1981?
justice
o'connor
which
made
reference
to
this
lump-sum
change?
justice
o'connor
and
it
is
your
position
that
that
did
constitute
written
notice,
if
written
notice
was
required?
justice
o'connor
in
your
responses
to
interrogatories,
in
the
proceedings
below,
did
you
acknowledge
that
written
notice
was
required
to
recipients,
as
well
as
applicants?
justice
o'connor
the
respondents,
i
thought,
said
that
was
the
case.
that
the
responses
to
interrogatories
made
no
distinction
between
the
notice
required
to
applicants
and
to
recipients.
justice
o'connor
i
see.
justice
o'connor
i
thought
she...
the
family
also
received
$16,000
in
a
workmens'
compensation
lump-sum
benefit
which
was
never
reported?
justice
o'connor
so
you
say
that
is
in
dispute.
in
any
event,
was
there
some
letter
sent
in
1981,
dated
september
18,
1981,
that
made
some
mention
of
the
lump-sum
rule?
justice
o'connor
and
ms.
jenkins
received
that?
justice
o'connor
so
she
did
get
something
other
than
what
was
in
that
pamphlet?
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
but,
ms.
jenkins
had
received
the
september
18,
1981
letter
which
did
mention
the
new
rule.
justice
o'connor
mr.
kirwin,
may
i
ask
you
to
tell
us
what
written
notice
was
given
to
applicants
for
welfare
before
1985
about
the
lump-sum
rule,
in
writing?
justice
o'connor
yes,
in
writing.
justice
o'connor
but
got
no
specific
written
notice
about
it
until
as
a
result
of
this
lawsuit?
you
implemented
new
information?
justice
o'connor
and
do
you
agree
that
the
regulation
of
the
secretary
does
require
written
notice
to
be
given
to
applicants?
justice
o'connor
concerning
the
lump-sum
rule?
justice
o'connor
so
when
the
secretary
in
response
to
the
written
interrogatories
said
that
information,
in
writing,
had
to
be
given
to
applicants
about
the
lump-sum
rule
and
its
operation
that
was
wrong,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
is
on
page
89
of
the
joint
appendix.
