what
would
be
the
rule
if
a
dealer
came
to
his
supplier
and
said,
this
fellow's
too
close
to
me,
i
want
a
bigger
area,
or
i
can
make
more
money
if
you'll
eliminate
that
competitor
of
mine
across
town.
and
the
manufacturer
says,
okay,
i
agree
to
do
it,
and
he
does.
what
rule
would
apply
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
conspire
to
eliminate
a
competitor?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
i
mean,
that
it's
not
per
se.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it's
aimed
at
stopping
competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
aimed
at
giving
the
favorite
dealer
more
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
the
price
cutting
conspiracy.
justice
byron
r.
white
same
result
economically,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
this
case,
he's
complaining
because
the
fellow's
cutting
price
and
taking
a
lot
of
business,
right?
