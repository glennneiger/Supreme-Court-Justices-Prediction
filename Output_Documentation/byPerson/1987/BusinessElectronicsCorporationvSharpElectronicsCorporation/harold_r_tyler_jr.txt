mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
listening
to
the
argument
of
petitioner
here,
it
is
well
for
us
to
make
very
clear
at
the
outset
that
sharp
is
not
contending
that
terminating
a
discounting
dealer,
such
as
has
occurred
here
in
june
of
'73,
is
always
permissible.
what
we're
arguing
is
that
such
a
decision
to
terminate
a
dealer
is
not
necessarily
legal,
that
is
to
say,
it
is
not
per
se
legal,
and
should
be
open
to
inquiry
in
the
courts
as
to
just
what
were
the
circumstances
that
led
to
that
termination.
what
was
going
on
in
the
marketplace.
what
services,
functions,
etcetera,
that
the
various
dealers
hired
in
the
marketing
system
of
the
manufacturer
and
supplier,
were
doing
best
so
as
to
be
as
competitive
as
possible
in
the
interbrand
marketplace.
in
other
words,
we're
arguing
that
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
should
not
presume
conclusively
that
terminating
dealers
is
always
anticompetitive.
in
many
instances,
as
this
court
has
already
recognized
in
sylvania
and
monsanto,
there
can
be
circumstances
where
this
kind
of
termination
for
price
cutting
is
not
anticompetitive
but
procompetitive,
particularly
when
you
measure
what
is
going
on
not
only
interbrand
but
intrabrand.
now,
let
me
suggest
that
one
of
the
difficulties
with
the
rule
apparently
argued
for
by
petitioner
is
that
without
really
doing
anymore
than
using
the
phraseology,
the
petitioner
seems
to
assume
that
terminating
a
discounter
is
so
obviously
and
exclusively
and
constantly
pernicious
that
it
can
be
assumed
in
each
case
to
be
anticompetitive.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
we
may
have
a
difficulty
there,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
think
he
made
the
using
agreement
a
little
more
broadly
than
he
ought.
in
other
words,
what
happened
here
was,
as
you
know,
that
actually
there
was
an
ultimatum
laid
down
by
the
surviving
dealer,
hartwell
in
june
of
'73.
and
it
is
true
that
confronted
with
that
ultimatum,
our
client
sharp
said
we're
going
to
go
with
the
dealer
that
we
think
will
do
a
better
job
because
we
don't
think
that
discounting
is
helping
us.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
no,
no.
i
agree
with
you.
hear
me
out.
we
could
have
the
same
argument
if,
for
example,
sharp
had
had
a
beauty
contest
here,
and
suddenly
sat
down
hartwell
and
business
electronics,
and
said,
fellas,
i
want
to
know
that
you
fully
understand
what
i'm
trying
to
do.
i'm
going
to
shift
my
marketing.
i'm
not
so
happy
with
constant
discounting.
i
want
full
service,
pre-sale,
point
of
sale,
post-sale.
let
me
evaluate
what
you
can
do,
and
you
tell
me
what
i
can
do.
that
supplier
without
an
ultimatum,
it
seems
to
me,
under
existing
case
law,
has
every
right
to
say,
well,
listen,
i'm
going
to
go
with
hartwell.
true,
i
might
make
a
little
more
money
in
houston
for
awhile
if
i
went
with
you,
business
electronics,
because
you
sell
cheaper.
presumably
you'll
sell
more
units.
but
i'm
going
for
the
bigger
score.
there
are
a
hundred
people
out
there
selling
manufacturing
calculators.
and
remember
this
was
a
long
time
ago
when
calculators
for
business
people
were
not
cheap,
a
thousand
dollars
and
so
on.
our
argument
is
that
dealer
should
expect
that
his
supplier
in
a
beauty
contest,
as
i
call
it,
has
every
right
to
go
with
the
dealer
who
is
not
the
discounter.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
respectfully,
justice
stevens,
i
don't
agree.
what
happened
in
the
charge
and
the
most
sensible
fact
finder
couldn't
help
without
more
with
the
charge,
what
the
trial
judge,
judge
seals,
did
was
say,
it
is
a
violation
of
section
1
if
a
terminated
dealer,
business
electronics,
comes
in
and
says,
a)
i
was
terminated.
no
doubt
about
that,
no
issue
of
fact.
b)
there
was
some
talk
i
was
terminated
because
i
was
a
discounter.
not
much
argument
about
that.
the
case
is
over.
we
said
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
right,
you've
got
to
do
a
little
more
than
that.
and
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
because
there
is
no
showing
in
that
instruction
or
that
view
of
the
law
that
keeps
in
mind
the
purpose
of
section
1.
and
that
is
to
prevent
a
remaining
dealer,
hartwell
in
this
case,
from
being
able
to
sit
down
with
his
supplier
and
actually
tie
hartwell,
the
remaining
dealer's
hands,
as
to
what
he
can
charge.
that
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
found
wrong.
there
was
no
real
evidence
about
that,
particularly
in
light
of
the
charge
which
didn't
take
that
into
account.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
then
i'd
be
in
a
little
trouble.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
because
in
the
cases
such
as
sylvania
and
monsanto,
as
i
read
them,
this
court
has
recognized
that
you
have
to
be
a
little
less
wooden
than
that.
you
have
to
allow
a
dealer
the
option
to
say,
hey,
i
have
two
dealers,
one's
a
discounter,
the
other
i
consider
a
full
service
or
at
least
a
better
full
service
dealer
than
that
discounter.
there
has
to
be
flexibility
to
allow
that
manufacturer
to
make
that
determination
if
he's
in
a
highly
competitive
position
interbrand.
and
the
distinction
that
the
court
below
drew
is
perfectly
sensible
and
consistent
with
sylvania
and
monsanto
because
it
said,
look
you've
got
to
go
further,
discounter,
who
comes
in
with
a
treble
damage
action,
and
show
there
was
some
agreement
to
hobble
or
restrain
the
surviving
dealer's
right
to
decide
what
to
charge
in
that
marketplace.
and
business
electronics
didn't
do
it.
and
with
that
instruction,
there
was
no
way
in
the
world
that
the
greatest
jury
or
fact
finder
could
avoid
doing
what
they
did
with
no
economic
advantage,
purpose,
or
fairness
whatsoever.
think
about
another
aspect
of
the
argument
petitioner
makes.
they
seem
to
think
that
somehow
what
happened
here
was
terribly
offensive,
but
apparently
are
willing
to
recognize
that
the
law
of
the
land
is
that
what
happened
here
in
practical
effect
is
legal.
and
what
i'm
adverting
to
here
is
that
once
hartwell
was
the
surviving
dealer,
he
became
an
exclusive
dealer
in
the
houston
area.
the
courts
say
you
can
do
this.
i
would
argue
that
once
you
say,
hey,
fellow,
you're
an
exclusive
in
houston,
that's
a
lot
more
devastating
and
stark
to
any
discounter
who
was
kicked
out
on
that
basis.
the
other
thing
is
the
argument,
apparently,
as
i
understand
business
electronics
is
that
look,
what
was
going
on
here
leads
to
the
possible
cartelization
of
the
calculator
industry.
counsel
for
business
electronics
cross
examined
the
sales
manager,
a
man
named
burkholder
in
this
trial,
and
brought
out
happily
that
at
the
time
there
were
a
hundred
firms
in
the
business
of
manufacturing,
like
sharp,
and
selling
calculators.
cartelization
with
a
hundred
competitors
across
this
great
country?
ridiculous.
another
thing
that
the
argument
comes
down
to
as
i
understand
petitioner
is
this,
that
we
are
in
no
trouble.
the
courts
would
take
no
offense
to
the
teaching
of
sylvania
and
monsanto,
if
they
took
the
broad
rule
that
they
argue
for.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
really
is
a
little
bit
tough.
as
i
read
sylvania,
the
court
in
that
case
reasoned
and
concluded
that
exclusive
dealerships
which
certainly
eliminate
intra-brand
competition
are
permissible.
now,
if
this
court
can
say
that,
why
not
allow
this,
particularly
since
all
we're
arguing
for
is
not
a
free
ride
ourselves.
we're
simply
arguing
that
the
rule
of
reason
should
apply
and
we
may
lose.
you
recall
in
the
decision
below,
judge
clark
pointed
out
his
view
of
the
evidence
as
he
understood
it
in
the
trial
record.
there's
evidence
on
both
sides.
i
assume
we're
not
here
to
argue
with
you
or
to
ask
this
court
to
decide
on
the
evidence,
but
the
point
is
there
should
be
a
chance.
and
if
the
price
cutter
can
show
that
what
happened
was
the
result
of
a
true
conspiracy
to
do
no
more
than
to
fix
retail
prices
through
his
surviving
retail
dealer,
or
some
other
anticompetitive
effect,
then
he
wins.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
exactly.
and
our
only
point
is,
we
want
to
support
that,
and
we
say
that's
fair
and
not
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
has
already
held
true.
the
facts
are
different
and
so
on.
let
me
make
one
other
point,
and
that
is
this:
one
of
the
curious
things
about
petitioner's
argument
here
is
that
normally
it
would
seem
from
an
economic
and
practical
point
of
view
that
if
i
were
a
supplier
of
a
calculator
and
i
liked
to
sell
calculators
particularly
in
a
big
city
like
houston,
and
if
as
i
think
the
marketplace
truly
was
in
the
early
70s,
you
know,
calculators
were
still
coming
along
and
weren't
quite
as
popular
as
they
are
today,
but
very
competitive.
i
would
really
hesitate
to
think
that
any
sensible
supplier
would
just
say
willy
nilly,
okay,
other
dealer,
you
come
in
and
say,
i
get
rid
of
the
price
cutter.
i
want
to
think
about
that
a
bit.
why
should
i
throw
out
the
fellow
who
might
sell
the
most
calculators
in
houston
unless
there
were
powerful
reasons
in
terms
of
what
i
was
trying
to
achieve
across
the
board
that
i'd
want
somebody
that
doesn't
discount
as
much.
let
me
point
out
another
obvious
economic
circumstance
here
which
petitioner
seems
strangely
to
ignore
in
arguing
on
the
law
point
here.
there
are
suppliers
in
this
world
which
don't
like
to
be
known
as
having
a
marketing
system
whereby
they
sell
in
discount
stores.
on
fifth
avenue
in
new
york
city,
there
are
fellows
who
have
signs
saying,
i'm
going
out
of
business
tomorrow,
come
in
and
buy
calculators
and
cameras
at
a
discount.
a
few
blocks
over
there's
bloomingdales.
they
sell
these
same
things.
their
suppliers
don't
want
sometimes
to
sell
their
products
by
these
discount
guys
on
fifth
avenue
who
have
fire
sales
or
going
out
of
business
sales.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
court's
existing
reasoning
in
the
earlier
cases
such
as
sylvania
and
monsanto,
leave
open
to
a
supplier
the
right
and
the
capacity
so
long
as
he
doesn't
do
something
to
maintain
retail
prices
at
some
level.
if
he
makes
the
determination
to
go
with
somebody
who
doesn't
charge
the
cheapest
prices--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--if
i
heard
you
rightly,
justice
stevens,
you
threw
in
a
number
of
parties.
that's
dangerous.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
right.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
yes.
so
long
as
in
this
arrangement
the
supplier,
let's
say,
sony,
to
take
it
out
of
this
case
says,
bloomingdales,
fine.
i
want
to
go
with
you
because
i
think
you're
a
better
dealer
and
you're
classy.
i
may
sell
more
units
with
the
fire
sale
guy,
a
couple
of
boxes
over,
that's
legal,
we
are.
now,
you
understand
that
this
encompasses
what
the
fifth
circuit
recognized.
i
can't
sit
down
then
quietly
as
the
manufacturer,
sony,
and
say,
now
look,
bloomies,
let's
agree
here
and
now,
you
know,
let's
keep
those
prices
pretty
much
what
i
say.
if
the
fire
sale
guy...
and
i
must
say
in
fairness
to
my
opposing
counsel,
i
perhaps
shouldn't
call
business
electronics
fire
sale
people;
i
don't
know
of
any
reason
to
think
they
were
that
way...
but
to
take
the
analogy,
i
couldn't
get
away
with
that.
and
that's
all
the
fifth
circuit
said.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
forgive
me,
sir,
i'm
betraying
my
past
and
where
i
was
a
professional
jury
watcher
for
many
years,
but
from
a
jury's
point
of
view,
or
a
fact
finder's
point
of
view,
we
can
almost
forecast
what's
going
to
happen.
a)
proof
of
termination.
no
dispute.
we
all
know
they
were
terminated
in
june
of
'73.
the
next
issue,
was
there
something
said
about
discounting?
i
don't
think
there's
any
great
issue
about
that.
what's
missing
in
this
case
is
the
awareness
that
there
should
be
a
proper
instruction
of
the
rule
of
law
that
would
enable
and
require
a
terminated
dealer
to
go
one
step
further
and
show
somehow
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
satisfaction
of
that
properly
instructed
juror,
that
this
amounted
to
an
agreement,
express
or
implied,
to
fix,
to
use
judge
clark's
words
below,
the
prices
in
such
a
way
that
was
restraining
the
hand
of
the
surviving
retailer
as
to
what
he'd
charge
for
calculators.
you
see,
that's
very
important
point
here.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
that's
getting
close
to
the
line.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
you've
confused
me,
excuse
me,
justice
scalia.
the
government's
position?
do
you
mean
in
the
antitrust
division?
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
i
think
it's
not
as
fuzzy
as
you
say,
with
all
respect.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
all
we're
arguing
here
is
look,
what
happened
below
was
the
judge
said
flatly,
look,
section
1
lays
it
down
as
a
matter
of
law
that
all
this
plaintiff,
petitioner
here,
has
to
prove
is,
one,
he
was
terminated.
no
doubt
about
it.
two,
there
was
some
talk
about
him
discounting
and
that's
why
he
was
terminated.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
yes,
but
that's,
if
i
may
say
so--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--it
is
a
lot
of
nonsense
in
this
sense.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
the
trouble
with
this
is,
once
you've
used
labels
like,
conspiracy
and
agreement,
they
can
be
freighted
with
more
meaning
than
the
law
or
common
sense
should
allow.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
i
don't
mind
saying
to
you,
justice
stevens,
that
there
was
an
agreement
in
a
sense
here.
what
else
could
there
be?
in
runs
hartwell,
who
by
the
way,
had
been
mumbling
and
fumbling
around
and
complaining
for
some
time,
sharp
had
been
saying,
oh,
no,
no,
we
can't
do
this,
we
can't
terminate
these
guys.
finally,
there's
an
ultimatum.
it's
either
us
or
them.
the
decision
is
made,
them.
you
can
call
that
agreement,
but
that's
not
an
agreement
which
is
rendered
illegal
by
section
1
standing
alone.
that's
our
point.
you
see,
we're
not
in
here
arguing
that
hey,
we
deserve
a
medal,
we
are
seeking
from
you,
justice
stevens,
a
ruling
that
once
this
kind
of
thing
happens,
it
is
deemed
legal,
per
se.
we're
saying
that
they
shouldn't
argue
that
what
happened
here
is
illegal
per
se
without
more.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
therefore,
i
don't
understand
this
play
on
words,
of
agreement
or
not
agreement
or
ultimatum
or
not
ultimatum.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
real
difference
between
us.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
though,
to
answer
what
you
and
justice
scalia
are
posing,
the
real
point
is
here
there
would
have
to
be
some
proof
that...
and
the
petitioner
here,
the
terminated
dealer,
i
assume
would
bear
the
burden
of
proof...
to
show
that
the
agreement
was
not
just
to
terminate,
but
there
had
to
be
more,
as
you
say.
there
had
to
be
an
agreement
to
restrict
in
some
way
the
surviving
dealer's
capacity
to
charge
prices
as
he
wanted
to.
a
good
illustration
is
in
this--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--no,
no.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry.
if
you
put
it
that
way
before,
i
missed
it.
this
that
you're
now
saying
to
me
is
quite
a
different
spin.
this
is
a
fast
ball
and
not
just
an
old
fashioned
curve.
what
you're
saying
now
is
quite
different.
let
me
repeat.
what
judge
clark
and
the
court
below
tried
to
say
is
all
we're
trying
to
say.
there
has
to
be
some
proof
that
once
the
terminated
dealer
is
told
be
gone,
because
you
discounted
and
you
did
this
and
you
didn't
do
that,
then
the
law
permits
this
so
long
as
the
discounted
dealer
whose
terminated
can't
come
in
and
show
that
there
was
truly
a
conspiracy
in
addition,
or
an
agreement
to
pick
up
on
the
colloquy
between
me
and
justice
stevens,
what
you
will
maybe
an
additional
agreement
to
stay
the
hand
or
restrict
the
hand
and
come
in
with
some
form
of
resale
price
maintenance
which
the
law
doesn't
permit.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
now,
that
raises
another
problem.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
no.
i
would
like
to
be
free,
i
would
like
i
say,
sharp
would
like
to
be
free
of
this
kind
of
instruction.
and
this
is
judge
seals.
listen
to
this:
"the
sherman
act
is
violated
when
a
seller
enters
into
an
agreement
or
understanding
with
one
of
its
dealers
to
terminate
another
dealer
because
of
the
dealer's
price
cutting.
"
that's
bad.
we
don't
want
that.
we
want
the
further
instruction
that
you've
got
to
go
further
and
find
that
there
was
an
agreement
express
or
implied
between
sharp
and
the
surviving
dealer
to
engage
in
some
form
of
retail
price
maintenance.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--if
you're
asking
the
point
or
raising
the
point
again
which
we
don't
like,
let
me
take
it
this
way.
i
would
say
to
you
that
it
should
not
be
sufficient,
as
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
thinks
would
be,
although
it's
unclear,
to
simply
go
in
and
among
other
things,
have
the
charger
of
the
rules
of
law
applicable
to
this
to
say
look,
the
mere
fact
that
everybody
seems
to
agree
that,
a)
there
was
a
termination
of
discounter,
and
a
remaining
dealer
who
picks
up
his
work,
that
may
be
enough,
jury,
for
you
to
infer
an
illegal
agreement
to
maintain
retail
prices
at
some
level.
i
don't
think
that's
enough,
but
i
think
this
court
has
already
answered
this
in
monsanto.
is
that
what
you're
getting
at?
otherwise,
i'm--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--i'd
prefer
to
phrase
it
a
little
better,
if
i
may
say
so,
but
i'll
accept
it.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
i'd
use
the
word,
discount.
i
think
i've
overstayed
my
time
to
allow
rebuttal.
