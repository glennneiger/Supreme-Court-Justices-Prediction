justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcgowan,
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
manufacturer,
sharp,
did
request
your
client
to
add
additional
salesmen
or
additional
services
or
anything
else
as
a
condition
of
retaining
his
dealership?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
dealership
agreement
in
the
record?
are
there
conditions
like
that
in
the
standard...
do
they
use
a
standard
agreement,
the
same
agreement
with
both
of
the
two
dealers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
the
record
show
whether
hartwell
had
all
these
additional
services
because
he
thought
it
was
a
good
way
to
run
his
business,
or
because
sharp
required
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
hartwell
handle
other
products,
too?
this
wasn't
his
only
line,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
percent
of
his
total
business
was
this
line?
does
it
indicate...
is
this
a
major
part
of
his
business
or
just
part
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
about
your
client?
was
this
the
only
product
your
client
handled?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tyler,
i
wonder
if
that's
fair
to
your
opponent's
case,
because
he's
not
saying
terminations
are
always
bad.
he's
saying
they're
bad
when
they're
done
pursuant
to
an
agreement
with
a
person
whose
having
his
business
taken
away
by
the
price
cutter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
know,
but
it
would
be
quite
a
different
case
if
there'd
been
no
ultimatum
and
no
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
exactly
what
the
judge
instructed
the
jury?
that
it
would
be
perfectly
all
right
to
do
it
unilaterally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
i
read
the
charge,
the
judge
did
distinguish
between
an
agreement
and
a
unilateral
termination.
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
assume
there
were
three
dealers,
and
two
of
them
went
to
the
supplier
and
said,
we're
both
going
to
quit
unless
you
terminate
the
third
because
he's
a
price
cutter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
isn't
that
the
same
case?
they
don't
agree
to
maintain
prices
themselves.
they
just
say
he
is
spoiling
the
market?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tyler,
your
bloomingdales
example
makes
me
wonder
with
respect
to
this
particular
case,
if
you
say
that
the
plaintiff
is
the
fire
sale
store,
he's
always
got
fire
sale
signs
up
and
the
surviving
dealer,
that
hartwell,
is
the
one
the
bloomingdales
in
the
pattern,
and
that
bloomingdales
said,
we
want
to
have
no
more
fire
sales,
and
if
you
terminate
him,
we
won't
necessarily
agree
to
sell
at
your
suggested
price,
but
we
at
least
won't
do
this
fire
sale
business,
we
won't
cut
30,
40
percent
off
the
list
price.
we'll
just
be
on
a
kind
of
a
reasonable
price.
would
that
violate
the
antitrust
laws
under
the
fifth
circuit
holding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
just
three
parties.
just
three
parties.
we've
got
a
discounter
fire
sale
person
who
sells
at
40
percent
off
list.
you've
got
a
bloomingdales
that
sells
usually
at
list
but
maybe
10
or
15
percent
off
from
time
to
time,
but
no
40
percent
stuff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
if
the
real
discounter
is
terminated
pursuant
to
an
agreement
with
bloomingdales
in
this
case,
and
the
agreement
is
well,
you
don't
have
to
sell
at
list,
but
you
certainly
are
not
going
to
behave
like
this
other
fellow
did
and
have
fire
sales
all
the
time.
would
that
be
legal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
what
the
fifth
circuit
requires
the
plaintiff
to
prove
on
the
retrial.
that
they
maintained
the
specific
suggested
prices,
that
they
agreed
to
maintain
specific
prices
or
just
that
they
agreed
not
to
discount
as
much
as
business
electronics
used
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that
isn't
what
he
said,
not
that
there
was
some
talk
about
it,
but
rather
he
was
terminated
pursuant
to
an
agreement.
that
was
critical
in
the
instruction
and
in
the
findings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
you
say
that's
a
lot
of
nonsense,
but
that's
what
the
jury
found.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
suggest
there's
no
distinction
between
unilateral
action
and
conspiratorial
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
exactly
what
the
judge,
that
was
what
the
judge
asked
the
jury
to
decide.
justice
john
paul
stevens
congress
picked
the
words.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
mr.
tyler,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
it's
settled
as
a
matter
of
jury
determination
that
there
was
an
agreement
between
the
surviving
dealer
and
the
manufacturer
to
have
it
cause
the
termination
of
the
plaintiff.
the
jury
found
that.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
yes,
there
was
an
agreement,
but
it
was
not
an
illegal
agreement
unless
one
of
the
terms
of
the
agreement
was
that
the
surviving
dealer
is
not
completely
free
to
charge
whatever
prices
he
wants.
and
justice
scalia
and
i
have
been
asking
you
whether
that
means
that
they
have
to
prove
that
well,
if
you
just
have
an
understanding
we
won't
charge
as
low
as
business
electronics
would,
would
that
make
it
illegal.
or
does
it
have
to
be
an
agreement
to
sell
at
list?
and
you
seem
to
be
unwilling
to
address
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcgowan,
can
i
ask
you
the
question
justice
scalia
and
i
were
asking
your
opponent.
how
do
you
interpret
judge
clark's
opinion?
do
you
understand
that
you
have
to
prove
merely
that
there
was
some
restraint,
as
i
understand
your
opponent
now
conceded,
in
hartwell's
ability
to
price
independently?
or
do
you
have
to
prove
that
he
agreed
to
follow
the
suggested
retail
prices
of
the
manufacturer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
funny.
each
of
you
interprets
it
in
a
way
more
favorable
to
your
opponent.
it's
strange.
