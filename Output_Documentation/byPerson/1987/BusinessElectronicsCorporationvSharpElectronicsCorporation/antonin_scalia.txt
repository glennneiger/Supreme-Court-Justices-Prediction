that
depends
on
what
you
mean.
lower
than
what?
was
it
established
here
that
the
non-terminated
dealer
would
only
charge
list
price
all
the
time,
and
that
the
price
cutter
was
always
cutting
below
list.
that
wasn't
established,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
sometimes
discounted
himself.
he
wasn't
always
selling
at
the
manufacturer's
suggested
retail
price,
was
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
really
can't
say
for
sure
that
by
terminating
the
other
one
for
discounting,
what
you
were
establishing
is
in
effect
the
manufacturer's
suggested
retail
price,
or
at
least
we
don't
know
that
for
certain.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
the
respondents
who
are
urging
a
broad
rule,
a
prophylactic
rule,
if
you
will,
it's
you.
that
is
to
say,
under
what
they
propose,
you
can
always
examine
each
case
one
by
one
and
decide
whether
indeed
the
free
rider
concern
exists
or
not.
but
your
principle
is
you
can
never
even
consider
that.
i
am
proposing
a
broad
rule
if
he's
being
terminated
for
charging
too
low
a
price,
it's
a
per
se
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
the
manufacturer
want
to
cause
his
products
to
be
sold
at
a
higher
price,
unless
he
had
something
to
gain
such
as
better
promotion
and
all
of
these
other
things
that
eliminate
the
free
rider
prospect?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
the
impression
you
expected
that
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mcgowan,
what
do
you
expect
a
manufacturer
to
do
when
he's
confronted
with
this
situation.
one
of
his
distributors
comes
and
says,
look,
i'm
a
full
service
distributor,
i
do
a
lot
of
advertising.
let's
assume
this
is
true.
i
know
you
say,
this
is
not
the
situation
here.
but
let's
assume
one
distributor
whose
a
good
guy,
he
has
a
full
showroom,
and
he
does
all
the
services.
and
he
comes
to
the
manufacturer
and
he
says,
this
other
fellow
is
a
discounter
and
he's
killing
me.
now,
i
cannot
compete
and
have
these
full
services
the
way
i
have
them
now.
either
terminate
him
or
i'm
going
to
quit.
what
is
the
manufacturer
supposed
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
have
to
police
those
and
only
if
he
violates
them
and
i
can
prove
in
a
lawsuit
that
he's
violated
them,
can
i
get
out
of
it.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
rather
expensive
way
to
get
rid
of
a
distributor.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
interbrand
competition,
you
have
to
assume
a
pretty
stupid
manufacturer,
since
i
assume
he's
getting
the
same
amount
from
the
distributor,
no
matter
how
much
the
distributor
sells.
why
would
he
want
to
reduce
his
share
of
the
interbrand
market?
i
can't
imagine
why.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
assumes
that
he
can
get
a
different
amount
from
the
distributor,
but
there's
no
indication
in
this
case,
nor
do
i
think
it's
normal,
that
you
charge
the
distributor
a
certain
percentage
of
what
he
sells
it
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
be
enough,
mr.
tyler,
if
it
were
just
understood
that
look,
the
reason
i'm
terminating
b.e.
is
because
they
were
charging
too
little.
now,
i
don't
care
what
you
charge,
hartwell,
but
it's
understood
you're
going
to
charge
more
than
b.e.
charged.
would
that
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
see,
i
understand
the
government's
position
very
well.
it's
a
nice
clear
position,
it
doesn't
matter
price
or
not.
whereas,
i'm
not
sure
of
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right,
right.
in
their
amicus
brief,
that's
clear
and
easy
to
apply.
yours
i
think
gets
very
fuzzy.
i'm
not
sure
how
you
instruct
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
hope
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
been
telling
us
that
that
can
exist.
i
mean,
part
of
your
earlier
presentation
was
look,
if
a
manufacturer
wants
to
go
with
a
person
whose
going
to
charge
a
higher
price
and
have
a
more
quality
product
and
more
services
and
what
not,
he
ought
to
be
able
to
do
it.
but
now
you're
telling
me
he
really
can't
be
sure
that
he's
getting
somebody
whose
going
to
charge
the
higher
price.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can't
even
be
part
of
his
understanding
that
the
non-terminated
dealer
will
at
least
charge
more
than
the
discounter
was
charging.
that
can't
even
be
part
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
be
clear
what
your
position
is.
you
say
it
would
be
enough
the
judge
could
instruct
the
jury,
it
is
enough,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
if
you
find
that
when
sharp
terminated
b.e.,
it
was
the
understanding
between
sharp
and
hartwell
that
hartwell
whatever
other
prices
he
might
charge,
would
at
least
not
charge
prices
as
low
as
b.e.?
if
you
find
that
there
was
even
that
minimal
understanding
regarding
price,
then
you
can
find
for
the
plaintiff.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is
that
the
instruction
you
want,
or
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
minimal
assurance
that
i
just
gave
you,
would
that
be
enough?
the
only
thing
i
ask
from
you
hartwell,
is
that
you
not
charge
prices
as
low
as
b.e.
i
don't
care
what
else.
we
have
no
other
understandings.
you
can
charge
any
prices
you
want,
but
at
least
this
much
is
understood
between
us,
you
won't
charge
as
low
as
b.e.--
would
that
be
enough
for
a
jury
verdict
against
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
agree
it
can't
be
inferred.
i
think
you
can
answer
this
one
yes
or
no.
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
if
you
find
an
explicit
agreement
between
sharp
and
hartwell
that
hartwell
would
not
charge
prices
as
low
as
b.e.'s
prices,
then
you
can
find
sharp
liable
under
the
antitrust
laws?
would
you
accept
that
instruction?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
really
a
different
question.
i
can
agree
with
you
that
i'm
getting
rid
of
this
discounter,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
i'm
not
going
to
allow
you
to
charge
as
low
prices,
if
in
the
course
of
your
business,
you
find
you
can
charge
that
low
a
price
and
still
make
a
good
business
for
yourself.
maybe
ten
years
hence
you
might
be
able
to
find
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
first
of
this
case
is
business
electronics
versus
sharp
comes
to
us
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
a
former
dealer
in
the
houston
area
of
electronic
calculators
manufactured
by
the
respondent.
petitioner
brought
suit
alleging
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
after
respondent
terminated
petitioner's
dealership
in
response
to
another
dealer's
complaints
about
petitioner's
lower
prices.
in
the
opinion
we
announced
today,
we
affirmed
the
fifth
circuit
and
hold
it
in
agreement
by
a
manufacturer
with
one
dealer
to
terminate
another
dealer
because
of
the
latter's
price
cutting
is
not
illegal
per
se
under
section
1,
unless
there
is
some
agreement
on
the
price
or
price
levels
to
be
charged
by
the
remaining
dealer.
as
is
more
fully
explained
in
the
opinion,
we
reached
this
conclusion
because
the
contrary
interpretation
is
inconsistent
with
the
doctrine
of
our
prior
case,
continental
t.v.,
incorporated
versus
gte
sylvania.
that
vertical
nonprice
agreements
are
not
illegal
per
se.
like
the
exclusive
territory
agreement
held
to
be
not
illegal
per
se
in
gte
sylvania,
vertical
agreements
to
terminate
price
cutting
dealers
have
the
quite
plausible
beneficial
purpose
of
allowing
the
remaining
dealers
to
provide
better
services
thereby
stimulating
interbrand
competition
and
have
not
been
shown
significantly
to
facilitate
cartels
that
reduce
interbrand
competition.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
justice
stevens
joined
by
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
