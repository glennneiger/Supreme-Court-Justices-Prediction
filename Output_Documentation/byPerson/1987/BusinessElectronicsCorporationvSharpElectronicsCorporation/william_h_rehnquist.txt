chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
85-1910,
business
electronics
corporation
versus
sharp
electronics
corporation.
mr.
mcgowan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
you've,
at
least
not
to
my
satisfaction,
completely
answered
justice
o'connor's
question.
you
say
that
the
free
rider
consideration
shouldn't
be
taken
into
account
here,
but
why
shouldn't
they.
i
mean,
if
we're
talking
about
economic
utility
and
that
sort
of
thing,
why
shouldn't
that
consideration
along
with
many
others
be
taken
into
account?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
must
we
look
for
the
least
restrictive
alternative
in
a
statutory
case,
and
it's
not
a
first
amendment
case--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--then
your
argument
is
not
how
much
that
it
doesn't
deserve
consideration
and
evaluation
of
the
legal
principles,
but
just
that
whatever
consideration
it
should
get
shouldn't
apply
here
because
this
really
wasn't
a
case
of
free
riding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
some
of
us...
i
dare
say
all
of
us...
have
had
some
experience
of
going
to
some
very
full
line
dealer
and
you
know,
getting
the
stuff
demonstrated
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
then
you
go
to
some
discount
house
and
buy
it
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
the
manufacturer
have
an
interest
in
protecting,
to
a
certain
extent,
dealers
that
do
provide
full
service
and
provide
advertising
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
mcgowan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
a
sense
of
congress
resolution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
what
weight
ought
this
court
to
give
i
mean,
this
isn't
the
congress
that
enacted
the
sherman
act,
or
enacted
the
clayton
act
or
any
of
the
basic
acts
upon
which
you
know,
the
various
per
se
rules
have
been
based.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
he
referring
to
sense
of
congress
resolutions
such
as
this
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcgowan.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
tyler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tyler,
the
fifth
circuit
majority
sent
this
case
back
for
a
new
trial
to
a
properly
instructed
jury,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
answer
that
question,
yes,
or
no,
can't
you,
mr.
tyler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tyler.
mr.
mcgowan,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcgowan.
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
--
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases,
no.
85-1910,
business
electronics
corporation
against
sharp
electronics
corporation,
and
no.
86-228,
kungys
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
