well,
mr.
mcgowan,
why
couldn't
an
agreement
to
eliminate
a
price
cutter
reflect
an
agreement
to
maintain
the
conditions
necessary
for
the
continuation
of
some
presale
promotional
practices,
instead?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
facts
may
show
that,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
speaks
to
whether
there
should
be
the
application
of
a
per
se
rule,
or
not.
