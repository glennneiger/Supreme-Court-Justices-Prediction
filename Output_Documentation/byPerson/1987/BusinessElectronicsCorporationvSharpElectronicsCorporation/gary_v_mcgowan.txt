mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
antitrust
case
arises
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
and
involves
an
allegation
of
vertical
price
fixing.
it
concerns
two
independent
dealers
in
houston,
texas,
who
bought
calculators
from
sharp
electronics
corporation,
and
resold
those
calculators
to
their
customers.
the
jury
below
found
an
agreement
between
sharp
and
hartwell,
hartwell
being
one
of
the
dealers
in
houston,
to
terminate
the
petitioner,
business
electronics,
the
other
dealer
in
houston,
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
price
cutting,
an
agreement
to
eliminate
price
cutting.
on
appeal,
sharp
did
not
contest
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
supporting
that
jury
finding,
but
instead
the
issue
in
this
appeal
is
whether
an
agreement
to
stop
price
cutting
by
terminating
the
price
cutter
is
a
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
the
fifth
circuit
below
held
that
such
an
agreement
did
not
constitute
price
fixing.
the
court
said
that
a
finding
of
price
fixing
required
literally
an
agreement
to
charge
resale
prices
at
some
level.
the
decision
below,
which
carves
out
conspiracies
to
eliminate
price
cutting
from
the
definition
of
resale
price
maintenance
should
be
reversed
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
such
a
rule
would
eviscerate
the
per
se
rule
against
price
fixing.
the
per
se
rule
would
be
so
narrow
as
to
catch
only
blatant
smoking
gun
cases
of
price
fixing.
such
a
rule
would
deter
only
the
ill
informed
and
unsophisticated.
it
could
easily
be
avoided.
instead
of
agreeing
on
price
directly,
suppliers
and
dealers
who
wish
to
achieve
adherence
to
resale
prices
could
simply
collude
to
terminate
dealers
who
refuse
to
charge
those
prices.
second,
a
conspiracy
to
terminate
dealers
who
don't
comply
with
the
suggested
resale
prices
is
clearly
a
form
of
resale
price
maintenance
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
this
court
has
never
limited
the
definition
of
vertical
price
fixing
to
direct
agreements
on
price.
in
parke,
davis
and
albrecht,
for
example,
the
court
said
that
resale
price
maintenance
need
not
take
the
form
of
an
actual
agreement
on
price.
it's
enough
for
the
plaintiff
to
show
collusion
to
enforce
suggested
resale
prices.
and
this
makes
sense.
there
is
no
meaningful
difference
between
a
direct
agreement
on
price
and
a
conspiracy
to
terminate
dealers
because
they
charge
lower
prices.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
it
was
established
here,
your
honor,
that
the
terminated
dealer
was
continually
discounting
and
it
was
established
that
the
non-terminated
dealer
wanted
to
avoid
that
discounting.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
there
is
evidence
that
he
sometimes
discounted
himself,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
--what
we
can
say
for
certain
is
that
a
price
cutter,
a
firm
that
was
clearly
charging
lower
than
the
manufacturer's
suggested
resale
prices
was
taken
out
of
the
marketplace
in
order
to
get
rid
of
that
price
cutting.
this
is
a
form
of
an
agreement
on
price,
because
it's
in
effect
an
agreement
which
says
these
lower
prices
should
not
be
charged
by
that
dealer.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
well,
your
honor,
that
contention
was
raised
in
this
case,
and
the
so-called
free
riding
concern,
promotion
services.
in
this
case,
the
evidence
showed
that
in
fact,
the
plaintiff,
business
electronics,
was
not
a
free
rider.
there
was
never
any
complaint
from
sharp
that
he
wasn't
providing
those
services.
the
complaint
from
sharp
was
that
he
was
price
cutting.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
well,
the
free
riding
rationale
would
in
effect
as
used
here,
your
honor,
as
a
thinly
distinguished
attack
on
the
per
se
rule
in
general,
the
same
free
rider
arguments
are
made
with
respect
to
the
per
se
rule
itself.
the
free
rider
arguments
should
not
be
given
any
weight
in
the
context
of
vertical
price
fixing.
in
sylvania,
this
court
alluded
to
free
rider
effects,
but
only
in
the
context
of
vertical
non-price
restrictions.
and
the
court
made
it
clear
that
as
to
price
restrictions,
there
are
significantly
different
policy
concerns
and
effects
as
to
price
restrictions.
as
to
price
restrictions,
the
courts
will
always
apply
the
per
se
rule.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
free
rider,
your
honor.
free
rider
means
a
failure
to
provide
a
certain
level
of
minimum
promotional
services,
there
are
far
less
restrictive
alternatives
than
vertical
price
fixing,
which
can
be
used
to
remedy
free
riding
to
the
extent
it's
a
problem.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
because
free
riding
is
a
ready
label
which
can
always
be
used
to
excuse
what
amounts
to
a
conspiracy
to
eliminate
price
cutting.
and
this
case
is
a
good
example
of
that.
i
mean,
there
was
no
evidence
that
business
electronics
was
actually
free
riding.
and
in
fact,
the
evidence
shows
that
if
anybody
was
free
riding,
it
was
hartwell.
because
business
electronics
had
been
an
established
dealer
in
this
market
for
four
years.
hartwell
was
then
appointed.
hartwell
then
started
soliciting
customers
from
business
electronics.
so
the
free
rider
rationale,
this
business
of
inducing
dealers
to
provide
additional
services
is
something
that
came
to
life
in
hindsight,
your
honor.
it's
not
something--
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
--this
wasn't
really
a
case
of
free
riding,
and
as
to
vertical
price
restraints
as
opposed
to
non-price
restraints,
free
riding
should
not
be
a
rationale
for
undermining
the
per
se
rule
itself.
now,
where
you're
talking
about
something
that
amounts
to
price
fixing,
these
free
rider
concerns
should
not
be
used
to
justify
price
fixing?
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
if
you
look
in
the
literature,
your
honor,
on
the
subject
of
free
riding,
you
can
look
high
and
low
in
that
literature,
and
there
is
almost
no
empirical
basis
for
it.
there
is
no
basis
for
assuming
that
this
free
rider
phenomenon
is
something
that
is
pervasive
in
our
economy,
or
is
something
that
should
be
used
to
justify--
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
--your
honor,
another
problem
with
free
riding
is
that
it
prevents
consumers
from
exercising
their
freedom
of
choice.
a
consumer
may
choose
to
buy
a
product
at
a
lower
price,
even
with
less
service.
and
even
though
there
may
be
cases
of
the
so-called
free
riding
you've
described,
those
cases
are
probably
so
narrow
and
so
unusual,
that
they
do
not
justify
applying
a
broad
based
rule
that
would
undercut
the
per
se
rule.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
the
manufacturer
can
achieve
that
interest
through
contractually
requiring
those
dealers
to
provide
a
minimum
level
of
service,
to
provide
a
minimum
number
of
salesmen,
to
provide
a
minimum
showroom
floor,
and
he
can
terminate
those
dealers
for
refusing
to
comply
with
those
contractual
requirements.
the
manufacturer
can
also
impose
non-price
vertical
restrictions
subject
to
the
rule
of
reason.
he
can
limit
territories
and
customers,
for
example.
but
to
use
what
amounts
to
vertical
price
fixing
to
avoid
the
free
rider
problem
is
like
using
a
shotgun
to
kill
a
mouse.
it's
overly
broad,
it's
crudely
broad.
it
eliminates
competition
much
more
than
is
necessary
to
cure
what
is
probably
a
very
minor
narrow
concern
in
our
economy.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
your
honor,
the
rationale
for
the
per
se
rule
is
based
on
a
judgment
that
certain
practices
are
likely
to
be
predominantly
anticompetitive.
and
we
submit
that
an
agreement
to
eliminate
price
cutting...
that's
what
the
jury
found
here,
and
that's
what
the
evidence
supported...
an
agreement
to
eliminate
price
cutting
is
predominantly
anticompetitive.
now,
when
you
apply
the
per
se
rule,
the
per
se
rule
is
applied
for
the
sake
of
litigation
efficiency,
and
business
certainty.
there
may
be
cases,
there
may
be
individual
cases
where
the
per
se
rule
catches
conduct
that
doesn't
have
a
terribly
anticompetitive
effect,
but
for
the
sake
of
litigation
efficiency
and
business
certainty,
the
per
se
rule
was
applied.
here,
i
think
it
can
be
generally
said
that
an
agreement
to
stop
price
cutting
by
terminating
price
cutters
is
predominantly
anticompetitive.
it's
clearly
a
price
restraint.
it
deserves
the
per
se
rule
for
that
reason.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
for
at
least
two
reasons,
your
honor.
the
first
reason
being,
as
justice
powell
recognized
in
the
sylvania
opinion,
it
may
facilitate
cartelizing,
cartelization
of
the
industry.
for
example,
we
have
evidence
in
this
case
that
sharp's
motive
in
imposing
resale
price
restrictions
on
its
dealers
was
pursuant
to
a
promise
that
it
made
to
its
competitors
not
to
enter
into
a
meaningless
price
cutting
war.
sharp
would
serve
as
an
example
for
the
industry.
that's
one
reason.
the
second
reason,
and
i
think
a
more
obvious
reason,
is
that
rigorous
price
competition
at
the
retail
level
is
eventually
going
to
put
back
pressure
on
the
manufacturer's
wholesale
prices.
the
manufacturer
cannot
stand
there
and
watch
retail
prices
continue
to
go
down
without
eventually
lowering
his
own
prices.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
court
below
said
that
there
was
no
price
fixing
here
because
hartwell
remained
free
to
charge
any
price
he
wanted.
now,
this
theoretical
freedom
is
an
artificial
distinction.
it's
unrealistic
to
suppose
that
the
remaining
dealer
will
use
his
freedom
to
do
anything
other
than
raise
prices
or
increase
margins.
i
mean,
after
all,
the
purpose
of
the
agreement
here
was
to
eliminate
price
cutting.
and
focusing
on
the
remaining
dealer's
supposed
freedom
ignores
the
reality
of
the
agreement.
it's
purpose
and
effect
was
to
destroy
business
electronics'
freedom
to
lower
prices.
the
narrow
definition
of
price
fixing
adopted
by
the
court
below
not
only
runs
against
this
court's
precedent
and
logic,
it
also
violates
the
antitrust
policy
laid
down
by
congress.
the
best
proof
of
this
can
be
seen
in
congressional
response
to
the
justice
department's
vertical
restraints
guidelines.
in
1985,
congress
passed
legislation
condemning
those
guidelines
as
an
effort
to
"dilute
or
trivialize"
the
per
se
rule.
and
congress
even
condemned
a
statement
in
the
guidelines
which
comes
very
close
to
the
holding
in
this
case.
and
i'll
quote
briefly.
"whereas,
such
policy
guidelines"--
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
--i'm
reading
now
from
page
37
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
quote
at
the
bottom.
"whereas
such
policy
guidelines
are
inconsistent
with
established
antitrust
law
as
reflected
in
supreme
court
decisions
and
statements
of
congressional
intent
in
stating
that
vertical
restraints
that
have
an
impact
upon
prices
that
are
subject
to
the
per
se
rule
of
illegality
only
if
there
is
an
explicit
agreement
as
to
specific
prices.
"
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
they
specifically
condemned
in
the
justice
department's
guidelines.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
was
actually
passed
and
signed
by
the
president.
in
addition,
using
its
power
over
appropriations,
congress
even
went
so
far
as
to
prohibit
the
justice
department
from
attempting
to
alter
or
amend
the
per
se
rule,
again
demonstrating
congressional
belief
that
the
per
se
rule
should
be
broadly
applied
in
the
area
of
vertical
price
fixing.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
your
honor,
in
sylvania
in
distinguishing
price
from
non-price
restraints,
and
in
reaffirming
the
application
of
the
per
se
rule
to
price
restraints,
justice
powell
took
pains
to
note
that
among
other
things,
congress
had
expressly
approved
the
per
se
rule
repeatedly
over
the
years.
and
most
of
that
indication
of
congressional
intent
has
occurred
since
1975.
so
it
should
be
given
great--
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
--he
was
referring
to
repeal
of
the
miller-tydings
act,
he
was
referring
to
congress
as
in
the
square
d
case,
congress
having
enacted
legislation
in
the
antitrust
field
without
being
aware
of
the
per
se
rule,
without
altering
the
per
se
rule,
for
example.
there
should
be
no
fear
here
that
reversal
of
the
fifth
circuit's
narrow
definition
of
price
fixing
would
erode
the
sylvania
decision.
the
court
made
clear
there
that
price
restraints
usually
reduce
both
interbrand
and
intrabrand
price
competition,
that
price
restraints
facilitate
cartelizing
and
that
congress
approved
the
per
se
rule.
we
are
not
dealing
here,
as
sharp
contends,
with
a
mere
exclusive
distributorship.
this
is
not
a
mere
agreement
to
terminate
a
dealer
who
happened
to
be
a
discounter.
an
exclusive
distributorship
is
defined
as
an
agreement
between
a
supplier
and
a
distributor,
whereby
the
supplier
agrees
not
to
appoint
any
other
dealer
in
a
defined
territory.
it's
clearly
a
non-price
restraint,
it
says
nothing
about
pricing.
here,
we
have
a
conspiracy
aimed
specifically
at
ending
price
cutting
by
a
dealer,
by
the
only
means
left
available
to
those
who
wanted
higher
prices,
and
that
is
termination
of
the
price
cutter.
sharp
says,
well,
you've
got
to
look
at
effect.
the
effect
is
the
same
whether
you
have
an
exclusive
distributorship
or
the
agreement
at
issue
here.
but
a
bona
fide
exclusive
distributorship
may
or
may
not
have
an
adverse
effect
on
interbrand
competition.
for
example,
if
sharp
had
appointed
business
electronics
as
its
exclusive
distributor,
a
price
cutter
would
have
remained
in
the
market
and
would
have
represented
price
competition
viz
a
viz
interbrand
competition.
and
even
if
an
exclusive
distributorship
had
the
same
effect
on
competition
as
the
agreement
here,
the
availability
of
lawful
means
to
achieve
the
same
result,
the
same
anticompetitive
result,
does
not
excuse
the
use
of
conspiracies
to
eliminate
price
cutters
and
unlawful
means.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
the
manufacturer
can
say
we
cannot
agree
to
terminate
this
man
because
of
his
discounting,
and
i'm
not
going
to
terminate
him
just
because
you
don't
like
his
discounting.
what
i
can
do,
if
it's
in
my
best
interest,
is
i
can
contractually
require
the
other
dealer
to
provide
minimum
services,
minimum
showroom,
number
of
salesmen,
floor
space,
and
so
forth,
so
that
at
least
he's
providing
full
services
like
i,
the
manufacturer
want
him
to
do.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
well,--
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
--but
the
manufacturer
is
always
free
to
unilaterally
terminate
a
distributor.
he's
free
to
set
up
non-price
restrictions,
and
if
the
distributor
violates
those
subject
to
rule
of
reason,
he's
free
to
terminate
the
distributor
for
those
reasons.
he
is
not
free,
as
happened
in
this
case,
to
enter
an
agreement...
which
is
uncontested.
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
supporting
the
agreement
is
uncontested.
he's
not
free
to
enter
into
an
agreement
to
eliminate
price
cutting
by
terminating
the
price
cutter.
i
mean,
this
is
a
case
where
business
electronic's
competitor
approached
business
electronics
and
wanted
to
engage
in
a
horizontal
price
fixing
conspiracy.
business
electronics
ignored
it,
refused
to
do
it.
sharp
repeatedly
requested
my
client
to
raise
his
prices.
he
refused
to
do
it.
it
finally
got
to
the
point
where
they
got
together
and
said
the
only
way
we
can
get
rid
of
this
distributor
is
terminate
him.
that's
the
only
way
this
price
cutting
is
going
to
go
away.
that
is
illegal,
and
that
is
a
far
cry
from
unilateral
termination
or
termination
because
of
violation
of
non-price
restrictions.
and
juries
can
tell
the
difference
between
those
two.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
complained
to
him
about
failure
to
provide
requisite
number
of
services.
my
client
did
lose
a
number
of
salesmen
well
before
hartwell
was
appointed
as
a
dealer,
and
didn't
have
as
many
salesmen
as
hartwell.
and
there
are
memos
in
the
file
saying,
he's
working
to
build
back
up
his
sales
force.
but
there's
no
evidence
that
they
ever
came
to
my
client
and
said,
if
you
don't
have
more
salesmen,
we're
going
to
terminate
you.
or
if
you
don't
provide
more
advertising,
we're
going
to
terminate
you.
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
to
support
the
notion
that
sharp
cared
about
the
level
of
advertising.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
there
is
no
dealership
agreement
in
the
record
for
hartwell,
i
don't
believe,
and
i
don't
think
there's
a
dealership
agreement
in
the
record
for
business
electronics,
either.
it's
irrelevant
to
the
case.
it
didn't
contain
any--
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
--the
record
shows
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
that
sharp
never
went
to
hartwell
before
the
termination
and
said,
we're
glad
you're
providing
these
services,
or
you
should
be
providing
these
services,
or
hartwell
said,
i
can't
provide
these
services.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
hartwell
himself
testified
that
the
termination
was
done
pursuant
to
his
request.
then
sharp
came
to
him
and
asked
an
open
ended
question,
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
this
market
now
that
it's
yours.
and
he
said
well
i'm
going
to
add
some
salesmen
and
the
sort
of
thing.
sharp
lost
salesmen
because
business
electronics
was
beating
him
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
it
was
not
his
only
line.
he
handled
numerous
other
office
products.
and
there's
no
evidence,
at
all,
by
the
way,
that
he
did
any
advertising
of
sharp
during
the
time
he
was
a
sharp
dealer.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
concerning
his
advertising
is
1981
and
1982,
some
nine
years
after
my
client
was
terminated
and
the
evidence
relates
to
his
budget
for
his
total
advertising,
which
includes
all
of
his
products.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
i
would
say
i
don't
believe
there
was
evidence
as
to
what
percentage
it
was.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
this
was
the
only
product
my
client
carried,
sharp
calculators.
nothing
in
this
court's
monsanto
case
requires
the
rule
adopted
by
the
fifth
circuit.
that
case
does
not
limit
vertical
price
fixing
to
a
single
form.
it
dealt
with
the
minimum
proof
required
to
show
collusion
in
the
vertical
context.
and
there's
no
issue
here
as
to
collusion
to
eliminate
price
cutting.
the
evidence
is
not
in
dispute.
here
the
question
is
what
kind
of
conspiracy
falls
within
the
scope
of
the
per
se
rule
applicable
to
price
fixing.
a
conspiracy
to
do
what?
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
the
rule
of
reason
would
apply
there,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
well,
subject
to
the
rule
of
reason.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
not
per
se.
it's
subject
to
the
rule
of
reason
because
it
doesn't
involve
price.
it's
not
price-related.
it's
not
an
agreement
specifically
aimed
at
stopping
the
price
cutting
of
the
existing
dealer.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
it
is
aimed
at
stopping
competition,
but--
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
--not
quite,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
--yes.
he's
complaining
because
of
the
lower
prices,
and
those
lower
prices
effect
interbrand
as
well
as
intrabrand
competition.
and
so
when
you
eliminate
those
low
prices
from
the
marketplace
through
a
conspiracy,
it
has
a
direct
effect
and
immediate
effect
on
both
inter
and
intrabrand
price
competition.
whereas,
if
the
agreement
to
terminate
has
nothing
to
do
with
price,
it
may
well
have
only
effects
insofar
as
price
competition
is
concerned,
on
intrabrand
competition.
again,
for
example,
if
the
dealer
who
is
given
the
exclusive
after
somebody
else
is
terminated
is
a
price
cutter
himself,
then
he's
still
in
there
keeping
prices
low,
viz
a
viz
other
brands.
so
that
would
be
the
difference
in
effect.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
manufacturer
might
want
to
reduce
his
share.
he
may
want
to
reduce
his
share
if
he
can
charge
higher
prices.
if
he
can
achieve
more
overall
profit
through
lower
volume
and
a
higher
price,
it
might
be
to
his
benefit
to
do
that.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
i
think
it
is
common,
your
honor,
for
manufacturers'
wholesale
prices
to
rise
and
fall
with
retail
prices.
the
cutting
edge
is
at
the
retail
end.
the
manufacturers
cannot
charge
wholesale
prices
in
ignorance
of
what's
happening
at
the
retail
level.
it's
important
to
realize
what's
at
stake
here.
the
free
riders
that
sharp
alludes
to
are
really
innovative
efficient
businessmen
who
enable
consumers
to
choose
lower
prices,
even
if
less
service
is
provided.
they're
the
targets,
the
k-marts,
the
discount
drug
stores.
they
are
the
businesses
like
business
electronics
in
this
case,
who
want
to
be
free
to
offer
lower
prices
to
their
customers.
at
stake
here
is
the
freedom
of
these
entrepreneurs
to
compete
on
price.
and
without
price
competition,
all
other
competition
is
mere
window
dressing.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
i
think
we
first
of
all
need
to
be
clear
on
the
full
instructions
given
by
judge
seals
below.
if
you
read
the
instructions
in
their
entirety,
he
made
it
clear
to
the
jury
that
the
jury
had
to
find
a
conspiracy
to
eliminate
price
cutting.
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
joint
appendix
19,
where
the
judge
said,
"sharp,
on
the
other
hand,
contends
that
it
terminated
business
electronics
unilaterally,
not
as
a
result
of
any
agreement
or
understanding
with
hartwell,
but
because
of
business
electronics'
sales
performance.
"
"if
you
find
that
sharp
did
not
terminate
business
electronics
pursuant
to
an
agreement
or
understanding
with
hartwell
to
eliminate
price
cutting
by
business
electronics,
then
you
should
answer,
no,
to
question
number
one.
"
it's
also
important,
to
repeat,
that
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
supporting
the
finding
of
that
agreement
has
never
been
contested
on
appeal.
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
there
should
be
the
requirement
of
a
further
finding
of
some
sort
of
direct
agreement
on
price
is
mere
surplus.
what
we
have
here
is
a
form
of
pricing
agreement,
an
agreement
to
stop
price
cutting
can't
be
anything
other
than
an
agreement
on
price.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
the
latter
is
the
way
i
understand
it.
i
will
confess
to
you
that
the
term--
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
--i
will
confess
to
you
that
the
terms,
agreement
on
price
at
some
level,
has
always
mystified
me,
exactly
what
it
means.
but
the
unfortunate
thing
is
that
read
literally,
it's
a
narrow
rule.
if
there
would
be
no
need
to
have
a
direct
agreement
on
price
if
suppliers
and
dealers
can
police
discounting
through
collusive
termination
of
discounters.
mr.
gary
v.
mcgowan
but
if
the
jury
is
instructed
that
in
order
to
find
a
conspiracy,
they
have
to
find
a
mutual
purpose
to
achieve
an
unlawful
objective,
and
the
jury
finds
that
there
was
a
mutual
purpose,
a
conspiracy
to
eliminate
price
cutting,
that
is
a
purpose
shared
by
both
the
supplier
and
the
dealer,
and
the
evidence
supports
that
finding,
then
it
has
to
be
a
form
of
vertical
price
fixing.
it
has
to
be
a
form
of...
there's
no
reason
to
have
that
purpose
other
than
to
eliminate
price
cutting.
it
is
unrealistic
to
assume
that
the
remaining
dealer
is
going
to
charge
lower
prices.
