mr.
donald
john
zelenka
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
submit
that
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
a
state
court
has
the
ability
in
collateral
review
proceedings
to
establish
its
own
procedures
and
develop
how
it
is
going
to
review
new
case
law
precedent
arising
out
of
its
own
court
and
other
courts.
we
submit
that
in
this
situation,
the
retroactive
application
is
not
compelled,
either
constitutionally
or
otherwise,
in
the
yates
decision.
we
contend
that
it
was
simply
a
determination
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
of
the
limits
of
the
type
of
review
it
would
give
in
state
habeas
proceedings.
in
that
situation,
a
somewhat
unique
situation
that
was
presented
before
this
court,
it
said
it
would
only
look
at
certain
situations
and
those
situations
were
if
the
trial
court
that
entered
the
conviction
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
that
situation,
and
secondly
if
the
criminal
conduct
involved
in
the
case
was
not
subject
to
criminal
sanction.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it
would
appear
that
they
did
decide
that
essentially
on
the
facts
by
that
one
sentence
that
they
had
when
they
held
that
this
charge
was
similar
to
the
charge
addressed
in
state
v.
elmore
and
similar
to
the
charges
addressed
in
francis
v.
franklin.
however,
i
would
submit
that--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--what
i
think
they
decided
was
the
limitations
of
the
type
of
relief
and
the
type
of
review
they
would
give
in
state
habeas
corpus
proceedings
in
its
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
it's
a
decision
only
to
consider
those
claims
that
hold
that
the
trial
court's
jurisdiction
was
null
and
void
or
that
the
particular
conduct
involved
was
not
subject
to
criminal
sanctions
in
the
case.
if
any
decision
falls
outside
of
those
decisions,
then
it
will
not
consider
those
retroactively
in
its
original
jurisdiction
in
these
matters.
there
is
a
state
post-conviction
relief
proceeding
that
mr.
yates
proceeded
to
apply
on
that
does
provide
certain
relief
in
constitutional
cases.
and
it
would
provide
relief
on
constitutional
issues,
if
those
issues
were
not
raised
or
could
not
have
been
raised
in
the
direct
appeal.
mr.
bruck
has
argued
somewhat
convincingly,
i
would
submit,
that
in
favorem
vitae
review
applies
in
this
case
and
in
any
capital
case
in
south
carolina.
but
a
close
reading
of
those
cases
would
reveal
that
they're
talking
about
the
direct
appeal
situation
where
they
have
a
much
broader
review.
there
is
no
case
in
south
carolina
that
sets
out
the
proposition
that
in
favorem
vitae
review
does
exist
in
state
collateral
proceedings
either
under
the
uniform
post-conviction
relief
act,
or
under
the
habeas
procedures
in
its
original
writ.
we
cited
the
case
of
tyler
v.
state
which
says
that
it
is
not
a
substitute
for
an
appeal.
so
when
the
court
had
this
matter
before
it,
they
had
a
situation
that
was
not
raised
on
direct
appeal,
was
not
objected
to
on
direct
appeal
in
a
case
that
occurred
two
years
after
the
sandstrom
v.
montana
decision
came
down,
which
the
petitioner
argues
set
the
bedrock
precedent
for
this
case.
subsequent
to
the
appeal
in
this
decision,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
did
hold
that
under
a
very
similar
charge
to
the
charge
in
this
case,
that
they
held
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
it
violated
the
constitution.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it
discussed
retroactivity
to
the
extent
that
they
considered
the
retroactivity
of
state
v.
elmore
and
whether
state
v.
elmore
was
essentially
a
decision
that
applied
new
law
or
applied
something
that
could
have
been
presented
previously
to
it
under
more
timely
procedures.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i
think
implicitly
in
that
decision
has
to
come
from
the
supreme
court's
decision
that
they
held
that
it
did
not
apply
retroactively
to
this
decision.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it's
a
holding
on
federal
constitutional
law
to
the
extent
that
they
looked
at
whether
those
procedures,
or
that
issue,
that
claim
could
be
presented
to
it
at
that
time.
and
they
held
it
could
not
under
their
own
state
procedural
law
because
it
did
not
hold
that
particular
criminal
conduct
to
have
divested
the
trial
court
of
jurisdiction
or
held
a
criminal
conduct
to
be
not--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--only
in
those
two
situations,
according
to
this
decision,
they
would
consider
it.
but
if
it's
in
any
other
situation,
the
retroactivity
issue
will
not
be
considered
unless
it
was
properly
presented
in
a
state
post-conviction
relief
format
or
had
a
reason
as
to
why
it
was
not
previously
presented
under
state
law.
now,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
allows
in
state
post-conviction
relief
that
issues
that
were
presented
or
asserted
in
direct
appeal
cannot
be
reasserted
in
state
post-conviction
relief
or
state
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
now,
that
is
the
same
situation
that
would
apply
here.
this
case
and
these
issues
as
presented
by
mr.
bruck
could
have
been
presented
on
direct
appeal.
furthermore,
he
had
the
opportunity
under
our
state
post-conviction
relief
act
to
reflect
as
to
why,
if
they
weren't
presented
on
direct
appeal,
why
they
weren't
presented.
for
example,
a
sixth
amendment
denial.
it
could
have
been
presented
that
way,
if
he
chose
to
present
it
that
way.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i
think
it
complied
with
a
mandate
of
this
court--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--to
the
extent
that
they
looked
at
the
francis
v.
franklin
issue
under
the
procedures
that
it
had
established
upon
review
of
situations
that
were
presented
to
it,
and
to
whether
those
particular
issues
could
be
presented
in
a
habeas
corpus
format.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
this
is
actually
one
of
the
first--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--this
is
at
that
time
one
of
the
first
two
cases
that
they
adopted
the
harlan
view,
they
adopted
it
also
+/-
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
for
their
own
procedures.
and
they
clearly
state
throughout
this
decision
that
they're
looking
at
the
retroactivity
of
state
court
decisions.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
the
elmore
case
occurred
before
francis
v.
franklin,
after
sandstrom.
they
never
made
a
decision
within
the
yates
decision,
whether
francis
applied
new
law
or
not.
what
they
implicitly
held
we
think
is
that
francis
did
not
fall
under
one
of
the
two
categories
that
they
would
look
at
a
situation,
divesting
the
trial
court
of
jurisdiction
of
the
conviction
or
the
situation
where
the
conduct
alleged
here
was
not
subject
to
criminal
sanctions.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
elmore
was
decided
after
the
trial
in
this
case,
but
before
the
state
post-conviction
relief
review,
and
a
woods
case
was
held
subsequent
and
during
the
state
post-conviction
relief
review
and
then
he
petitioned
at
that
third
stage
while
the
state
post-conviction
relief
review
was
pending
on
appeal
to
ask
this
court
in
its
original
jurisdiction
to
look
at
the
state
v.
elmore
case
and
apply
that
retroactively.
we
would
submit
that
that
unique
situation
that
he
was
looking
for.
in
fact,
in
his
petition
itself
he
is
saying
we
are
seeking
the
ability
to
argue
the
applicability
of
state
v.
elmore
and
state
v.
woods
to
this
factual
situation.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
denied
both
times
to
apply
it
to
this
situation.
he's
asserting
that
there
is
in
favorem
vitae
review
in
the
south
carolina
decisions
at
any
stage
during
the
proceedings.
we
would
submit
that
the
yates
decision
itself
clearly
stands
for
the
proposition
that
under
south
carolina
law,
in
favorem
vitae
review
does
not
exist
at
all
proceedings
because
they
acknowledge
in
this
case
that
the
jury
charges
in
state
v.
elmore
were
similar
to
those
that
were
found
in
violation...
excuse
me...
that
the
jury
charges
in
this
case
were
similar
to
those
found
in
violation
in
state
v.
elmore.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
similar
to
it.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
sir.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
well,
they
could
have
been
relying
on
sandstrom
v.
montana.
they
did
not
say
it
in
their
decision.
or
they
could
have
been
relying
on
their
own
state
constitution.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
there
was
a
case
that
preceded
that,
state
v.
madison,
where
they
held
there
was
a
jury
charge
somewhat
similar
to
the
jury
charge
in
this
particular
case.
they
found
that
it
was
not
violative
of
the
constitution,
but
then
they
held
in
madison
a
similar
charge
that
should
have
been
given.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
have
they
ever
cited
and
followed
sandstrom?
they've
cited
it
and
they've
cited
francis
in
a
recent
decision.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
they
have...
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
cannot
recall
specifically
a
case
that
has
cited
the
sandstrom
situation.
we
have
relied
essentially
on
state
law
decisions
of
state
v.
elmore,
state
v.
lewellyn,
which
stand
for
very
similar
concepts
of
the
sandstrom
case.
and
they've
relied
on
those.
but
in
a
recent
case,
state
v.
patrick,
they
did
acknowledge
that
the
francis
situation
applied
to
that.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
not
necessarily.
it
would
apply
in
any
situation
if
the
individual--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--claimed
that
he
was
not
indicted,
that
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
him,
or
a
situation
where
he
was
charged
with
criminal
conduct
that
subsequently
was
determined
not
to
be
criminal
conduct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
sir.
in
state
habeas
under
this
decision,
that
would
be
it,
but
under
collateral
review,
they
have
much
broader
abilities
to
do
challenges
under
sixth
amendment
violations
and
similar
violations
in
the
uniform
post-conviction
relief
act.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
because
this
decision
fall
in
a
different
procedural
mode
than
the
normal
collateral
review
that's
done
in
south
carolina.
it
did
not
fall
within
the
uniform
post-conviction
relief
act,
which
sets
out
the
ability
to
do
challenges
under
the
united
states
constitution,
generally.
it
is...
the
uniform
post-conviction
relief
act
is
more
analogous
to
28
u.s.c.
2254
than
the
state
habeas
proceeding
that
he
went
in
and
he
asked
to
apply
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
we
think
that's
what
this
decision
stands
for,
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
whether
it's
a
change
in
the
law
or
not.
those
matters
should
necessarily
then
be
brought
under
the
uniform
post-conviction
relief
act.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
the
problem
with
his
attempt
to
invoke
the
uniform
post-conviction
relief
act
is
that
he
is
probably
procedurally
barred
because
south
carolina
has,
under
rule
50
of
the
supreme
court
rules,
a
successive
application.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that
would
not
be
an
available
remedy.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it
was
an
available
remedy
to
the
extent
that
the
application
for
post-conviction
relief
was
pending
when
elmore
was
decided.
i
mean,
he
could
have
sought
the
sandstrom
issue
under
elmore.
now,
francis
v.
franklin
had
not
yet
been
decided,
so
under
the
francis
issue,
it
would
not
be
available.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no.
i
think
what
we're
saying
is,
you
don't
have
that
remedy
available
to
you
under
the
state
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
i
think
that's
all
they're
saying.
i
don't
think
they're
saying--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--the
only
part
of
the
opinion
that
i
would
assert
that
i
find
them
saying
that
is
in
their
conclusion
in
which
they
state
that
collateral
attack
of
a
criminal
conviction...
and
this
is
at
the
joint
appendix,
page
34,
the
top
of
the
page,
collateral
attack
of
a
criminal
conviction--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--page
34
of
the
joint
appendix.
collateral
attack
of
a
criminal
conviction
on
the
basis
of
legal
precedent
that
developed
after
the
conviction
became
final
must
be
reserved
for
those
cases
in
which
the
trial
court's
action
was
without
jurisdiction
or
as
void
because
the
defendant's
conduct
is
not
subject
to
criminal
sanctions.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it
would
not
bar
it
from
being
brought
under
the
uniform
post-conviction
relief
act,
if
he
could
show
a
reason
why
he
did
not
or
could
not
raise
that
at
the
time
of
the
original
action.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no.
because
they're
looking
at
any
type
of
legal
precedent,
any
case
that
comes
down.
what
i
think
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
is
saying
that
every
time
a
new
decision
comes
out,
that
does
not
automatically
allow
an
individual
to
come
to
the
court
to
enter
the
court
to
kill
the
finality
that
existed
on
that
conviction
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
if
that's
what
you
think,
then
this
decision
is
wrong
to
the
extent
that
it
would
apply
to
the
francis
situation.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
not
necessarily,
because
there
are
significant
procedural
bars
in
this
case.
it
would
most
appropriately
then
be
a
remand
to
determine
whether
bars
existed.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
decision--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--the
decision
was
correct
to
the...
he
determined
that
the
decision
was
wrong
to
the
extent
that
it
pointed
to
francis
and
whether
francis
was
new
law.
i
would
submit
that
the
question
is
that
the
judgment
was
correct
because
they
denied
it
in
this
situation
because
they
were
not
going
to
open
up
the
courts
to
a
situation
that
could
have
been
presented,
a
claim
that
could
have
been
presented
previously.
they
determined
that
there
was
no
reason
for
the
opening
up
of
the
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it
was
not
raised
on
direct
appeal
in
the
state
courts
and
it
was
not
raised
in
the
uniform
application
of
post-conviction
relief.
a
petition
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
court
was
made
that
requested
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
to
apply
the
principles
of
state
v.
elmore
and
state
v.
woods
to
this
case,
while
that
case
was
pending.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
it
is
not.
the
opinion
that
was
vacated
is
on
page
27.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
yes,
that
was
on
state
habeas
corpus,
and
all
it
said
was
we
have
considered
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
conclude
that
it
should
be
denied.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it
was
denial
without
an
opinion.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
okay,
the
original
writ
requested
reconsideration
in
light
of
state
v.
elmore
and
state
v.
woods,
because
those
decisions
came
out
after
the
direct
appeal
in
state
v.
yates,
the
decision
you
were
initially
pointing
to.
now,
while
that
decision
was
pending
before
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
francis
came
out
and
he
petitioned
to
supplement.
and
shortly
after
his
petition
to
supplement,
this
decision
came
down.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that's
correct.
and
that
is
one
position
that
we
presented
to
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
we
submit
they
didn't
need
to
address
that
issue.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
he
pursued
both
remedies
before
and
that
was
on
appeal.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
before
you
remanded
it.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it
was
our
understanding
from
the
remand
and
the
particular
request
within
the
particular
petition
that
he
was
seeking
the
writ
of
certiorari
only
under
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that
would
be
correct,
yes.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that
would--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--he
had
the
same
individual
counsel
he
has
here
today
representing
him,
along
with
a
member
of
the
appellate
defense
commission
of
south
carolina
in
the
post-conviction
relief
appeal.
and
he
also
had
counsel
in
the
state
post-conviction
relief
proceedings
when
he
raised
a
sixth
amendment
challenge
based
upon
a
closing
argument
of
a
solicitor
that
was
similar
to
the
thompson
v.
aiken
argument
and
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
implicitly
rejected
that
with
a
denial
of
the
certiorari
petition
done
pursuant
to
rule
50
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
rules.
we
would
submit
that
the
south
carolina
courts
have
the
ability
to
fashion
the
types
of
relief
that
it
is
going
to
give
and
fashion
the
types
of
procedures
that
it's
going
to
give
in
those
situations,
as
long
as
it
does
not
discriminate
in
those
claims
that
are
presented
to
it.
,--
in
this
situation,
we
submit
that
the
south
carolina
court
established
its
own
common
law
and
that
they
were
not
going
to
look
at
the
issues
as
presented
in
elmore
similar
to
the
issues
as
presented
in
this
case
in
its
original
jurisdiction.
further,
we
would
submit
that
the
south
carolina
court--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--on
the
theory
that
they
were
retroactive.
but
in
addition,
we
would
submit
that
because
it
was
a
sense
of
a
procedural
bar
because
of
the
situation
in
elmore
that
if
it
was
a
sandstrom
issue
as
he
urged
in
that
particular
case
that
that
issue
could
have
been
raised
previously.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it's
not
within
the
decision.
that
was
within
his
argument
that
he
made
before
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
we
would
further
submit
that
the
jury
charges
in
this
particular
case
did
not
violate
francis
v.
franklin
in
that
they
did
not,
when
closely
viewed,
shift
any
burden
of
proof
on
any
of
the
particular
elements
of
the
crime.
it
was
merely
first
a
definition
of
the
sense
of
malice
that
it
is
the
doing
of
an
unlawful
act
without
just
cause
or
excuse,
and
second
that
malice
is
implied
or
presumed
from
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
is
really
no
presumption
at
all
because
it
was
followed
immediately
by
the
sentence
that
said,
when
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
are
presented
surrounding
the
use
of
the
weapon,
that
presumption
is
removed,
and
ultimately
is
for
the
jury
to
determine
under
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
whether
in
fact
malice
existed
in
the
heart
and
mind
of
the
killer.
we
would
further
submit
that
this
case
does
present
a
situation
where
there
was
harmless
error.
now
while
we
understand
that
the
proceedings
that
are
before
the
court
does
not
mandate
this
court
to
determine
harmless
error,
we
think
that
if
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
was
in
error
in
this
particular
order,
that
a
remand
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
determine
the
issue
of
harmless
of
error.
but
we
think
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case,
as
we
have
briefed,
support
a
conclusion
that
any
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
thank
you.
