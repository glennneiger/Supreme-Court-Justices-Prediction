chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bruck,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
as
we
have
already
jettisoned
a
considerable
part
of
it
on
the
other
side
on
direct
appeal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
had
said
in
connection
with
its
own
state
habeas
that
we're
not
going
to
entertain
any
challenges
that
go
to
jury
instructions.
that's
just
the
kind
of
thing
that
we're
not
going
to
consider
on
collateral
attack
and
we
don't
care
whether
they're
state
challenges
or
federal
challenges.
and
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
had
decided
this
case
on
that
basis.
do
you
think
that
you
would
have
a
federal
question
to
preserve
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
realize
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
but
it
would
mean
in
their
own
state
collateral
review,
they
would
not
have
to
decide
any
claim.
federal
or
state,
based
on
a
jury
instruction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
realize
that
is
not
what
they
did.
so
a
state
can
circumscribe
in
some
respects
the
kind
of
claims
it's
going
to
consider
on
collateral
review.
of
course
some
answer
to
that
question
may
be
indicated
by
the
fact
that
we
chiefly
relied
on
francis.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
patterson
case?
i
mean,
certainly
that
indicated
that
mullaney
should
not
be
construed
as
broadly
as
it
might
have
been.
in
fact,
it
cut
back
rather
sharply
on
mullaney.
so
it
wasn't
just
one
great
big
progress
onward
and
upward
as
you
would
suggest.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
has
the
case
been
discussed
in
the
south
carolina
courts
as
if
it's
the
retroactivity
of
francis
v.
franklin
rather
than
the
retroactivity
of
sandstrom?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bruck.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
zelenka.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you're
right,
mr.
zelenka,
why
does
the
supreme
court's
opinion
in
this
case
discuss
retroactivity
so
elaborately?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean
didn't
they
also
consider
whether
francis
v.
franklin
should
be
applied
retroactively?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
a
holding
really
on
federal
constitutional
law,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you're
saying
when
they're
talking
about
retroactivity,
they're
saying
that
only
if
a
new
decision
divests
the
court
of
jurisdiction
or
makes
the
conduct
not
criminal
will
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
consider
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
the
opinion
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
dated
december
22,
1982,
the
per
curiam
that
appears,
begins
on
page
10
of
the
joint
appendix?
is
that
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
which
we
vacated
or
remanded?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
was
denial
without
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zelenka.
mr.
bruck,
you
have
nine
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
question
if
i
may.
just
glancing
through
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
on
direct
appeal
in
1982,
it
gives
no
intimation
that
any
challenge
to
this
jury
instruction
was
made
on
direct
appeal.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
rehnquist
on
page
34
of
the
joint
appendix
if
i'm
reading
where
i
think
justice
o'connor
was
referring
to,
it
says,
collateral
attack
of
a
criminal
conviction
on
the
basis
of
legal
precedent
that
developed
after
the
conviction
became
final
must
be
reserved
for
those
cases
in
which
the
trial
court's
action
was
without
jurisdiction,
or
is
void
because
the
defendant's
conduct
is
not
subject
to
criminal
sanction.
now,
that's
the
majority
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
law
in
south
carolina
has
changed
since
march,
march
29,
september
29,
1986,
when
this
opinion
issued?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bruck.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-6060,
yates
against
aiken
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
