justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
bruck,
if
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
does
not
discriminate
against
federal
claims,
does
this
court
have
authority
to
tell
that
court
what
retroactivity
law
to
apply
in
a
state
habeas
proceeding
to
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
what
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
the
harlan
view?
would
you
lose?
justice
o'connor
mr.
zelenka,
explain
to
me
why
the
court
chose
not
to
consider
francis
v.
franklin
on
the
remand?
justice
o'connor
what
does
that
mean?
i
don't
understand.
what
do
you
think
they
decided
with
regard
to
francis
v.
franklin?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
it
a
decision
just
not
to
consider
federal
claims?
justice
o'connor
what
page,
please?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
about
what
it
says
up
here
that
this
kind
of
state
habeas
proceeding
is
limited
to
the
two
little
circumstances
that
are
mentioned
by
mr.
zelenka?
justice
o'connor
would
it
be
cognizable
in
this
form
of
state
habeas
proceeding
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
despite
its
language
saying
it
wouldn't
be?
