justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
the
sequence
of
events.
state
against
elmore
was
decided
in
1983.
now,
that's
before
francis
against
franklin?
justice
stevens
and
that
case
had
an
instruction
identical
with
francis
against
franklin,
i
mean,
for
all
purposes,
this
court
assumed
that
it
was
the
same,
did
it
not,
your
state
supreme
court?
justice
stevens
so
that
when
they
held
the
instruction
bad
in
the
elmore
case,
they
were
not
relying
on
franklin,
because
it
hadn't
been
decided?
justice
stevens
so
they
must
have
been
relying
on
sandstrom
against
montana,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
does
the
elmore
case
cite
any
federal
precedent
in
it?
i
haven't
read
it,
i
have
to
confess.
justice
stevens
it
did
not.
i
see.
justice
stevens
has
your
state
supreme
court
ever
cited
and
followed
sandstrom
against
montana?
justice
stevens
no,
i
meant
sandstrom
against
montana.
have
they
ever
cited
and
followed
sandstrom
against
montana,
do
you
know?
justice
stevens
then
are
you
also
saying,
assume
you
prevail
in
this
court
on
the
theory
that
you
espouse,
that
this
particular
petitioner
should
go
back
to
south
carolina
and
invoke
the
uniform
post-conviction
relief
act
before
he
would
have
exhausted
his
state
remedies?
justice
stevens
so
you're
saying
that
is
not
actually
an
available
remedy
at
this
time?
justice
stevens
and
it
also
was
not
an
available
remedy
at
the
time
of
the
decision
we're
reviewing
now?
justice
stevens
but
are
you
telling
us...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you...
are
you
telling
us
that
the
way
you
read
this
decision
that
they
in
effect
are
saying,
you've
pursued
the
wrong
remedy
and
you
should
have
pursued
the
uniform
post-conviction
relief
act?
justice
stevens
and
where
in
the
opinion
do
you
find
them
saying
that?
justice
stevens
may
i
also
point
out,
if
i
read
this
correctly,
the
order
on
page
27
doesn't
just
deny
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
but
it
also
denies
the
petition
seeking
review
of
the
denial
of
the
application
for
post-conviction
relief.
justice
stevens
so
apparently,
your
opponent
pursued
both
remedies.
justice
stevens
before
we
remanded
it?
justice
stevens
but
our
remand
was
in
a
case
that
both
invoked
the
post-conviction
relief
statute
and
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
stevens
because
in
the
order
at
least,
he
was
seeking
review
of
applied
to
both,
that
much
is
clear.
justice
stevens
but
you
think
he
bifurcated
it
in
effect
and
only
wanted
the
relief
from
half
of
it?
justice
stevens
did
he
proceed
pro
se
here,
or
did
he
have
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
that
the
petitioner
and
in
accomplice
robbed
a
country
store
in
south
carolina
in
1981.
after
the
petitioner
left
the
store,
a
fight
occurred
in
which
his
the
accomplice
and
the
wife
of
the
storekeeper
were
both
killed.
petitioner
was
convicted
of
murder
and
sentenced
to
death
and
the
conviction
sentence
was
affirmed
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
at
his
trial,
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
did
not
intend
to
kill
anyone
or
to
harm
anyone
and
of
course
he
pointed
out
that
the
victim
had
not
even
been
present
when
he
was
in
the
store,
the
jury
was
nevertheless
instructed
that
malice
could
be
presumed
from
the
fact
that
he
had
a
deadly
weapon
in
his
possession.
a
few
months
after
his
conviction
was
affirmed.
in
an
unrelated
case
involving
a
man
named
elmore,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
held
that
the
instruction
similar
the
one
given
in
petitioner's
trial
was
improper
and
unconstitutional
and
the
petitioner
therefore,
sought
a
relief
based
on
that
holding.
and
while
his
petition
is
pending
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
we
decided
a
case
called
francis
against
franklin,
which
also
held
such
an
instruction
unconstitutional
and
the
petitioner
then
called
that
case
to
the
attention
of
south
carolina
supreme
court
as
well
as
relying
of
an
earlier
case
of
arson
the
similar
ban
called
sandstrom
against
montana.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
denied
relief
without
an
opinion.
the
petitioner
then
sought
relief
from
us
and
we
granted
certiorari
and
summarily
vacated
the
judgment
and
requested
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
to
reconsider
its
action
in
the
light
of
the
francis
decision.
when
the
case
went
back
to
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
they
concluded
that
the
instruction
was
inconsistent
with
francis
and
also
with
elmore
but
nevertheless
denied
relief
because
they
did
not
think
they
should
apply
the
elmore
case,
which
is
a
state
case
retroactively.
so,
the
petitioner
came
back
again
and
we
granted
certiorari,
because
we
are
concerned
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
might
not
have
fully
complied
with
our
mandate,
and
we
agreed
of
course
with
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
the
constitutional
errer
was
committed
but
they
did
not
consider
whether
the
francis
case
might
be
applied
retroactively,
so
it
was
incumbent
upon
to
do
so.
we
have
nwo
decided
that
there
really
is
no
retroactivity
issue
even
presented
because
francis
against
franklin
was
merely
an
application
of
a
principle
decided
in
the
earlier
case
and
therefore
we
have
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
with
instructions
to
comply
with
what
we
say
in
our
opinion.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
