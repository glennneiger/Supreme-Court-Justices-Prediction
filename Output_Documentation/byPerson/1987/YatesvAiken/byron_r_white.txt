justice
white
because
there
was
not
a
new
decision,
is
that
it?
justice
white
but
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that,
do
you
lose?
justice
white
francis
certainly
changed
an
awful
lot
of
things
that
had
been
regularly
going
on.
justice
white
an
awful
lot
of
people
didn't
understand
what
bedrock
due
process
was
before
francis.
justice
white
isn't
that
what
we
did
in
this
case?
justice
white
you
would
say
that
francis...
any
francis-type
case
would
be
foreshadowed
by
sandstrom?
justice
white
well,
the
court
said
in
francis
that
such
inferences,
permissive
inferences
do
not
necessarily
implicate
the
concerns
of
sandstrom.
justice
white
well,
this
is
the
first
time
it
decided
it,
though?
justice
white
it
decided
to
adopt
the
harlan
view
both
ways.
justice
white
for
their
own
procedures?
justice
white
but
of
course,
did
they
think
that
this
case,
that
francis
made
new
law,
or
what
was
their
case,
the
elmore
case?
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
that
elmore
was
decided
after
the
trial
in
this
case?
justice
white
so
if
we
think
that
francis
was
just
a
plain
open
and
shut
application
of
sandstrom,
we
reverse?
justice
white
all
right,
all
right.
but
nevertheless,
the
decision
was
wrong.
justice
white
i
thought
that's
what
you
said
in
answer
to
justice
scalia.
justice
white
was
that
on
collateral?
justice
white
well,
did
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
raise
the--
justice
white
--well,
a
good
answer
to
the
remand
would
have
been,
this
is
procedurally
barred.
justice
white
but
that
is
not
the
way
it
wrote.
justice
white
what
business
was
there
raising
it
in
the
proceeding
in
this
case?
wasn't
that
it
was
an
original
habeas?
justice
white
in
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina?
justice
white
what
was
raised
in
that
state
collateral
proceeding?
justice
white
when
was
the
sandstrom
francis
instruction
issue
first
raised
anywhere
in
the
south
carolina
courts?
justice
white
and
i
take
it
that
the
suggestion
is
that
that
claim
was
procedurally
barred?
justice
white
and
i
suppose
that
if
there
had
been
a
procedural
bar,
the
opinion
in
this
case,
they
wouldn't
have
needed
to
go
to
all
the
trouble
of
writing
an
opinion
in
this
case.
they
could
have
just
said,
procedurally
barred.
