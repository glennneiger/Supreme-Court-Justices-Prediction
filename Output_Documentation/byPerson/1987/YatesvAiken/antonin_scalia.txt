i
think
that's
probably
true.
but
why
should
we
get
into
doing
harmless
error
analysis
here?
justice
scalia
yes,
why
should
we,
you
know,
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
rest,
why
shouldn't
we
just
remand
and
give
them
a
chance
to
determine
whether
they
think
it
was
harmless
or
not?
justice
scalia
mr.
zelenka,
i
don't
entirely
understand
what
the
south
carolina
court
is
doing
here.
if
we
do
not
have
a
retroactivity
case
in
front
of
us,
if
i
think
this
is
not
a
retroactivity
case,
then
would
the
south
carolina
supreme
court's
determination
that
this
does
not
come
within
one
of
the
only
two
categories
that
we
entertained
review
in,
would
that
be
wrong?
justice
scalia
doesn't
the
limitation
to
those
two
categories
only
apply
in
retroactivity
cases?
justice
scalia
any
collateral?
justice
scalia
and
those
are
the
only
bases
on
which
you
can
collaterally
attack
a
judgment
on
habeas
in
south
carolina?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
why
is
this
decision
different
from
all
others?
justice
scalia
and
you
say
under
this
procedure,
the
only
things
he
could
have
raised
were
those
two
categories?
justice
scalia
whether
it's
a
change
in
the
law
or
not.
justice
scalia
but
that's
retroactivity,
and
i
asked
you
whether
this
decision
would
apply
whether
or
not
the
claim
was
based
on
retroactivity
or
not.
this
is
retroactivity
talk.
legal
precedent
that
developed
after
the
conviction
became
final.
now,
i'm
saying,
what
if
i
believe
that
the
claim
here
is
not
based
on
legal
precedent
that
developed
after
the
conviction
became
final?
this
decision
wouldn't
bar
it
from
being
brought.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
fine,
but
it's
a
different
point.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
this
decision
says,
if
i
don't
believe
that
this
case
is
one
involving
new
law,
then
this
decision's
wrong.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
this
is
not
a
new
decision.
there's
no
new
decision
he's
relying
on.
imagine
i
think
that
he's
relying
on
you
know,
sandstrom,
all
the
way
back.
it's
been
clear
for
years
and
years.
if
that's
what
i
think
then
this
decision's
wrong?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
a
different
ground,
though.
if
we
remand,
they
can
decide
that
this
is
excessive
application
or
that
he's
procedurally
barred
or
something
else.
but
that's
not
the
basis
that
this
decision
rests
on.
it
would
be
strange...
i
guess
we've
made
mistakes
before,
but
if
we
vacate
and
remand
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
sandstrom,
there
must
have
been
some
federal
issue
presented
to
us.
in
light
of
francis,
there
must
have
been
some
federal
issue
presented
to
us,
namely
the
issue
of
this
instruction,
and
i
suppose
that
it
had
been
represented
to
us
that
the
issue
had
been
raised
on
direct
appeal
in
the
state
courts.
was
it?
justice
scalia
under
the
theory
that
they
were
retroactive?
justice
scalia
where
is
that?
