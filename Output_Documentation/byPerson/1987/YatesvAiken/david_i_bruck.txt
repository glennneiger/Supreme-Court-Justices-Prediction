mr.
david
i.
bruck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
state
in
a
refusal
to
give
retroactive
effect
to
this
court's
decision
in
francis
v.
franklin
to
cases
which
were
final
on
direct
appeal
when
francis
was
decided.
as
in
any
retroactivity
case,
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
to
review
a
little
of
the
procedural
history
that
got
us
to
this
question.
petitioner
dale
yates
was
tried
and
convicted
of
murder
in
1981,
two
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
sandstrom
v.
montana.
his
appeal
was
decided
in
late
1982.
no
objection
was
raised
at
trial
or
on
appeal
to
the
unconstitutional
jury
instruction
which
is
at
the
core
of
this
case.
however,
that
creates
no
procedural
bar
under
south
carolina
law
under
a
very
very
well
established
line
of
south
carolina
cases.
indeed,
in
his
direct
appeal
opinion,
the
court
said
that
it
reviewed
the
entire
record
of
mr.
yates'
trial
in
favorem
vitae
as
is
south
carolina
supreme
court's
invariable
practice
in
capital
cases
alone.
it
has
a
rather
strict
procedural
default
rule
in
non-capital
cases,
but
it
has
no
such
rule
in
capital
cases.
and
the
court
said
that
it
found
no
prejudicial
error.
a
year,
a
little
less
than
a
year
later,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
for
the
first
time,
sustained
a
sandstrom
challenge
to
a
series
of
burden
shifting
jury
instructions
involving
the
essential
element
of
malice,
which
is
an
essential
element
of
murder
under
south
carolina
law.
the
first
of
those
decisions
in
1983
was
a
case
called
state
v.
elmore.
a
few
months
after
elmore,
yates
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
state
supreme
court
alleging
that
the
jury
instructions
in
his
case
which
i
think
we
all
agree
were
materially
identical
to
those
involved
in
elmore,
created...
and
i
quote...
"an
unconstitutional
burden
shifting
presumption
of
malice.
"
he
alleged
that
it
created
a
mandatory
rebuttable
presumption
of
malice,
and
he
cited
sandstrom
v.
montana
as
authority
for
that
proposition.
he
also
said
that
in
light
of
elmore
and
another
case,
state
v.
woods
that
had
also
applied
sandstrom
to
strike
down
the
same
instructions,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
should
apply
its
own
decisions
and
uphold
his
constitutional
claim.
while
this
petition...
the
state
responded,
by
the
way,
to
this
original
petition
by
saying
that
they
agreed
that
his
petition
should
be
consolidated
with
another
appeal
then
before
the
state
supreme
court
to
resolve
the
apparent
issues.
the
court...
however,
the
respondent,
the
state
of
south
carolina,
argued
on
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim
that
in
fact
it
was
not
a
bad
jury
instruction,
and
presented
exclusively
federal
authority
saying
that
the
instruction
could
be
distinguished
from
that
involved
in
sandstrom.
while
his
petition
was
pending,
this
court
decided
francis
v.
franklin.
yates
submitted
the
francis
decision
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
said
that
francis
was
absolutely
on
all
fours,
and
required
reversal.
the
court...
about
three
weeks
after
it
got
the
francis
decision,
the
state
court
said
that
it
had
in
a
per
curiam
decision
without
opinion
said
that
it
had
considered
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
concluded
that
it
should
be
denied.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
it
cited
nothing.
what
i
recited
is
exactly
the
words
that
the
state
court
used.
yates
then
petitioned
this
court
for
certiorari
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
remanded
to
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
francis
v.
franklin.
on
remand,
the
judgement
occurred
which
is
the
subject
of
this
matter
here
today.
the
state
supreme
court's
opinion
on
remand
begins
by
acknowledging
in
the
first
breath
that
the
constitutional
error
involved
here
is
a
violation
of
francis
v.
franklin.
the
way
the
court
put
it
was
that
the
instructions
here
violated
the
principals
of
state
v.
elmore,
and
involved
the
same
infirmities
as
those
addressed
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
francis.
but
immediately
after
saying
that,
the
state
supreme
court
then
said,
so
the
question
before
us
is
the
retroactivity
of
state
v.
elmore,
completely
ignoring
the
fact
that
it
had
just
finished
conceding,
or
acknowledging
that
this
was
a
federal
constitutional
error
that
had
been
committed
in
the
case.
the
court
then
said
that
retroactivity...
taking
a
couple
of
lines
out
of
this
court's
retroactivity
doctrine
which
the
state
court
apparently
misinterpreted
to
mean
that
the
retroactivity
of
constitutional
decisions
is
entirely
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
then
proceeded
to
say
that
they
found
the
view
expressed
by
justice
harlan
in
desist
and
mackey
to
be
persuasive,
and
therefore
the
court
would,
as
a
matter
of
its
own
state
law,
not
apply
the
doctrine
condemning
mandatory
rebuttable
presumptions,
an
essential
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
the
difficulty
is
that
the
claim
is
a
federal
one.
i
think
the
answer
is,
yes.
the
retroactivity
of
federal
constitutional
decisions
is
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
and
the
state
court,
in
effect,
was
discriminating
against
that
whole
body
of
this
court's
constitutional
doctrine,
when
it
said
that
we
are
simply
not
going
to
apply
it.
the
crucial
thing
to
stress
here
is
that
this
is
not...
no
matter
how
much
the
state
attempts
now
to
recast
this
matter...
is
not
a
case
involving
a
state's
construction
of
its
own
post-conviction
remedy.
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
it
would
not
have
made
a
nickel's
worth
of
difference
whether
dale
yates
had
raised
his
claim
on
direct
appeal,
had
raised
it
at
trial,
had
raised
it
all
along.
if
the
state
court
had
denied
relief
prior
to
its
own
final
rather
belated
acknowledgment
of
the
principles
of
sandstrom
in
the
elmore
decision,
they
would
have
come
up
with
exactly
the
same
decision
if
yates
had
then
later
renewed
his
claim
after
he
noticed
that
the
state
supreme
court
had
begun
to
apply
sandstrom.
and
i
think
the
proof
of
that
is
in
another
line
of
south
carolina
retroactivity
decisions
led
by
truesdale
v.
aiken,
a
case
involving
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
believed
to
be
a
question
involving
the
retroactivity
of
this
court's
decision
in
skipper
v.
south
carolina.
and
in
truesdale,
the
petitioner
in
truesdale
had
raised
his
skipper
claim
well
before
skipper
on
direct
appeal.
he
met...
it
met
with
no
success.
he
then
raised
it
again
on
post-conviction
relief
and
the
state
court
came
up
with
a
decision
very
very
similar...
a
little
short
of
it,
but
essentially
the
same
decision
as
is
involved
in
this
case,
saying
that
they
again
have
decided
to
apply
skipper
only
on
direct
appeal
and
that
they're
adopting
in
effect
the
justice
harlan
view
in
collateral
review.
this
court
summarily
reversed,
i
think
correctly,
i
believe,
recognizing
that
the
retroactivity,
as
i
say,
of
a
federal
constitutional
decision
is
not
a
matter
that
states
have
the
authority
to
pick
and
choose.
so
we
don't
say
that
there's
any
discrimination
between
one
sort
of
federal
claim
and
another,
but
simply
that
south
carolina
has
misinterpreted
the
federal
nature
of
the
constitutional
law.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
not
in
this
case
because
there
is
no
retroactivity
issue
in
this
case.
i...
i
think
this
court
would
probably
be
more--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--because
francis
simply
applied
by
its
very
terms
simply
applied
doctrine
of--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--if
you
disagree
with
me
on
that
and
decide
to
jettison
the
last
24
years
of
retroactivity
and
to
jettison
the
stovall,
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
because
i
think
that
as
francis,
itself
described
the
constitutional
principle
involved
here
as
an
axiomatic
fundamental
bedrock
principle
of
due
process
that
no
one
may
be
imprisoned,
or
in
this
instance,
executed
without
having
the
state
born
its
burden
of
proving
his
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
we
are
dealing
i
think
with
something--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
that's
true,
i
realize
that
would
be
debatable.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
apparently
so.
there
have
been
a
number
of
states
that
have
been
giving
these
instructions.
be
that
as
it
may,
that
was
the
court's
holding,
and
i
certainly
think
that
we
are
dealing
in
francis
v.
franklin
with
a
constitutional
issue
that
is
very
close
to
the
core
of
our
basic
of
due
process.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no.
of
course,
that's
not
what
they
did.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i
don't
quarrel
at
all
with
the
proposition
that
a
state
can
limit
its
federal
remedy.
now,
of
course
that
would
not
create
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
would
not
create
any
sort
of
a
wainwright
v.
sikes
bar
down
the
line.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i
have
not
thought
about
that,
but
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
they
could
have
done
it.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes
sir,
certainly,
in
this...
in
this...
in
this
+/-
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
sir.
absolutely.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
was
instructed
to
reconsider
this
case
in
light
of
francis
v.
franklin.
and
of
course,
there
is
absolutely
no
state
procedural
doctrine
in
south
carolina
whatsoever
that
shuts
the
door
on
one
procedural
category
of
claims
and
not
on
others.
i
realize
the
state
has
tried
to
identify
some
defect
in
the
initial
habeas
proceeding
papers.
i
don't
know
that
that
really
needs
to
be
responded
to.
perhaps,
if
need
be
if
that
claim
is
renewed
today,
i
may
touch
on
it
in
reply.
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
think
the
basic
error
that
the
state
court
committed
when
they
got
this
case
on
remand
was
their
failure
to
recognize
that
there
is
a
threshold
test
in
any
retroactivity
case
that
must
be
addressed.
and
that
is
whether
or
not
you
are
dealing
with
a
new
decision.
and
i
don't
think
there
are
very
many
cases
in
which
this
court
more
clearly
indicated...
and
i
realize
there
was
disagreement
within
the
court...
but
the
majority
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
clearly
held
that
francis
v.
franklin
simply
applied
one
of
the
alternate
holdings
of
sandstrom
v.
montana.
some
of
the
proof
of
how
not
new
a
decision
in
francis
was
is
that
south
carolina
had
in
other
contexts,
and
with
other
instructions,
already
applied
this
very
portion
of
sandstrom.
and
indeed,
state
against
elmore
was
an
application
of
the
principles
of
francis
before
francis
was
decided.
everything
they
needed
to
have
applied
francis
they
could
have
gotten,
and
did
get
out
of
sandstrom
v.
montana.
so
where
a
retroactivity
issue
came
from
in
this
case
is
something
which
i'm
still
struggling
from
the
state's
opinion
to
understand.
the...
of
course,
when
we
apply
the
stovall
factors,
assuming
that
the
court
is
not
inclined
to
use
this
case
to
reconsider
the
viability
of
the
stovall
retroactivity
doctrine,
it's
rather
clear
that
this
francis
v.
franklin
or
sandstrom
v.
montana,
whatever
principles
one
wishes
to
label
them
as,
follow
very
clearly
on
the
retroactive
application
side
of
the
stovall
factors.
first
and
foremost,
we
consider
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
and
the
purpose
of
this
rule
is
to
insure
that
the
state
bears
its
burden
of
proof
and
that
only
the
guilty
are
convicted
and
the
innocent
are
acquitted.
that
is
at
the
very
heart
of
the
truth
seeking
function
in
criminal
trials,
as
this
court
very
clearly
stressed
in
francis.
at
that
point,
the
second
two
factors
under
this
court's
cases
really
fall
out
of
the
picture.
but
even
if
we
look
at
them,
justifiable
reliance
on
the
old
rule,
after
sandstrom
v.
montana,
and
really
after
mullaney
v.
wilbur
in
1975,
there
could
have
been
no
justifiable
reliance
on
any
notion
that
states
were
entitled
to
shift
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
an
essential
element
of
an
offense.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
yes,
that's
true.
but
patterson
nevertheless
it
used
an
analysis
of
the
elements
test.
it
focused
on
what
the
elements
of
the
crime
were.
and
here,
certainly
malice
is
an
element
of
murder
and
no
one
could
have
read
patterson
to
think
that
it
is
justifiable
to
shift
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
the
element
of
malice
under
south
carolina
law.
in
any
event,
sandstrom
v.
montana
which
followed
patterson
could
not
really
have
been
much
clearer
on
this
point,
although
the
instructions
are
probably
most
easily
read
in
sandstrom
as
a
conclusive
presumption.
that
issue
was
in
doubt,
and
the
court
said
whether
it
be
conclusive
of
whether
it
be
mandatorily
rebuttable,
it
is
no
less
unconstitutional.
that
was
two
years
before
this
person's
trial,
three
years
before
his
direct
appeal.
and
there
could
not
be
any
conceivable
justifiable
reliance
on
any
prior
rule,
state
or
federal.
finally,
we
have
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice.
the
impact
in
this
case
is
truly
negligible.
south
carolina
naturally
is
concerned
about
applying
rules
to
cases
which
are
already
final,
but
i
would
stress
that
south
carolina
has
an
extremely
rigid
system
of
procedural
default
in
all
but
capital
cases.
so
that
anyone
who
didn't
raise
this
and
properly
litigate
it
both
at
trial
and
on
direct
appeal,
there
is
no
interest
of
justice
exception,
there
is
no
fundamental
error
exception
under
9
capital
south
carolina
criminal
law
so
there
are
very
very
few
cases
in
the
pipeline.
and
in
any
event,
there
is
no
right
for
south
carolina
now
to
be
able
to
claim
that
that's
a
valid
factor
to
consider.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
sir.
i
would
think,
any.
i...
the
court
simply
denied
in
francis
there
was
any
new
law
being
made.
it
was
simply
an
instruction
which
was
clearly
of
the
mandatory
rebuttable
type.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
the
problem
is
here
that
south
carolina
itself,
as
our
state
supreme
court
has
recognized
over
and
over
again,
is
that
we're
not
dealing
with
a
permissive
inference
but
rather
with
a
mandatory
rebuttable
presumption.
malice
is
presumed
from
x,
y,
and
z
facts.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
there'd
be
no
issue
of
retroactivity
of
sandstrom
because
sandstrom
occurred
two
years
before
this
man's
trial.
the
bubbling
up
of
this
retroactivity
issue
is
frankly
a
mystery
to
me.
the
petitioner
did
ask
the
state
supreme
court
to
apply
the
state
decisions
applying
sandstrom
retroactively.
we
thought
it
simply
the
most
tactful
way
of
putting
the
matter,
but
we
also
made
clear
the
federal
constitutional
character
of
the
claim
in
the
habeas
papers.
but
i
confess
to
complete
bewilderment
as
to
how
this
case
became
a
retroactivity
case
when
there
is
new
law
to
be
applied
by
the
state
supreme
court.
clearly,
what
has
somehow
happened
in
this
case
is
that
we
have
a
state
supreme
court
which
simply
has
denied
that
the
retroactivity
or
that
the
obligation...
whether
you
call
it
retroactivity
or
not...
the
obligation
of
a
state
court
to
apply
federal
law
in
its
courts,
whether
it
be
civil,
criminal,
post-conviction,
or
direct
appeal,
is
a
matter
of
federal,
not
state
law.
and
that's
where
we
got
off
onto
this...
south
carolina
supreme
court
on
remand...
onto
this
tangent.
the
state
argues
beyond
the
retroactivity
issue,
the
state
puts
a
great
deal
of
effort
in
their
brief
to
argue
that
in
fact
this
isn't
such
a
bad
instruction
and
that
it
is
not
an
unconstitutional
instruction.
this
is
a
claim
which
it
has
pressed
over
and
over
again
without
success.
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
it
has
recently
been
rejected
by
the
fourth
circuit
in
hyman
v.
aiken,
a
federal
habeas
case
from
which
the
state
has
not
sought
review
in
this
court.
it
is
really
a
matter
which
is
all
but
settled,
and
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
brief,
i
would
suggest
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
and
the
fourth
circuit
have
correctly
identified
the
constitutional
infirmity
of
both
of
the
malice
instructions
at
issue
here.
and
don't
really
feel
that
the
state's
position
has
any
merit
on
that
score.
they
also
argue
that
this
court
ought
to
make
the
first
determination
of
whether
the
error
was
harmless.
i've
argued
at
some
length
in
the
reply
brief
that
in
view
of
both
of
the
two
theories
of
prosecution
that
were
used
in
this
case
and
applying
south
carolina
law
and
the
particular
form
of
the
law
of
parties
in
accomplice
liability
under
south
carolina
law,
that
the
states
harmless
error
argument
has
no
merit.
i
would
simply
stress
here
that
this
again
was
pressed
vigorously
before
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
did
not
expressly
reject
the
harmless
error
argument,
but
i
should
think
that
if
under
south
carolina
law
and
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
south
carolina
court
had
seen
merit
in
the
harmless
error
argument,
it
is
most
unlikely
that
they
would
have
gone
off
into
the
area
of
retroactivity.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i'm
sorry,
why
should
you?
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that
would
suit
me
fine.
i
really
think
that
is
certainly
what
this
court's
precedents
envision
i
think
in
almost
every
situation,
even
the
very
case
in
which
you
held
that
there
could
be
harmless
error
under
francis
v.
franklin,
you
then
remanded
to
the
federal
court
in
habeas
to
allow
that
determination
to
be
made.
and
that
certainly
would
seem
to
be
the
most
reasonable
way
to
proceed
in
this
case.
i
think
south
carolina
when
the
case
is
remanded
will
grant
this
person
a
new
trial,
but
that
is
between
us
and
them.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
some
time
in
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
if
i
might
just
briefly
answer--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--that
is
correct,
there
was
none.
appointed
trial
counsel
handled
the
trial
and
the
direct
appeal,
and
the
trial
court
post-conviction
relief
proceedings,
all
the
same
court
appointed
lawyer.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
this
claim
was
brought
in
original--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--original
habeas
jurisdiction
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
at
the
same
time
as
the
post
conviction
appeal
was
being
heard.
the
state's
response
was
that
they
did
not
object
to
consolidating
the
two
cases
for
the
purpose
of,
and
i
quote,
"resolving
the
apparent
issues".
it
is
only
when
the
state
began
to
lose
that
they--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--the
primary
issue
was
improper
jury
argument
which
was
also
a
matter
which
could
have
been
raised.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
it
was
first
raised
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
state
supreme
court
in
january,
1985.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that
is
not
a
suggestion
that
can
fairly
be
made
on
any
basis
in
south
carolina
law.
what
that
is
is
the
state's
unsuccessful
argument
to
convince
the
state
supreme
court
to
create
a
procedural
bar.
there
is
none.
south
carolina
has
made
the
reasoned
judgment
that
in
capital
cases--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--absolutely.
but
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
would
not
do
that
because
that
is
not
the
law.
it
has
not
ever
been
the
law.
the
state
cites
a
non-capital
case
from
the
60s,
dealing
with
a
procedurally
barred
trial
claim
that
couldn't
be
raised
on
habeas
and
that's
all
the
authority.
the
authority
on
the
other
side
is
a
case
called
thompson
v.
aiken,
cited
at
footnote
5
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
thompson
v.
aiken,
a
trial
arising
in
the
very
same
courtroom
as
this
one
did,
involved
an
improper
jury
argument
by
a
solicitor
which
was
not
raised
on
direct
appeal,
it
was
not
objected
to
at
trial,
on
post-conviction
relief,
the
petitioner
filed
a
collateral
attack,
raising
for
the
first
time,
the
solicitor's
improper
jury
argument,
it
was
rejected
at
the
trial
court
level,
and
on
appeal,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
granted
relief,
reversed,
said
that
in
effect,
we
missed
it
on
the
first
go
around
but
we
have
subsequently
decided
in
other
cases
that
these
arguments
are
improper.
we
cannot
distinguish
the
argument
here
from
the
argument
there.
therefore,
this
man
is
entitled
to
a
new
sentencing
hearing.
the
thompson
v.
aiken,
i
think
totally
disposes
of
this
whole
nest
of
procedural
arguments
which
south
carolina
has
raised
without
success
below,
and
now
tries
to
renew
here.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
i
think
it
is
only
the
state's
brief
that
says
that.
the
state
supreme
court
never
said
so
in
its
opinion,
and
the
part
of
the
opinion
that
mr.
zelenka
read
to
justice
scalia
as
the
justice
pointed
out
dealt
only
with
retroactivity.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes,
it
is.
that,
again,
by
its
terms
applies
only
to
retroactivity.
in
any
event,
that
was
not
the
law
the
court
applied
in
thompson
v.
aiken.
since
they
applied
their
own
precedents
retroactively,
it
seems
that
they
have
reserved
this
doctrine
specially
for
francis
v.
franklin.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no,
i'm
not.
what
this
is
is
a
retroactivity
holding
and
they
have
not
changed
the
scope.
this
only
kicks
in
once
they
identify
some
new
legal
doctrine
by
its
very
terms
on
the
basis
of
legal
precedent
that
developed
after
the
conviction
became
final.
if
the
precedent
had
been
there
all
along,
and
it
was
in
this
case,
this
claim
would
be
cognizable
under
south
carolina
law
even
though
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
on
collateral
review.
that
is
a
well
settled
principle
in
south
carolina.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
otherwise.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
they
are...
when
they
are
speaking
of
collateral
attack,
they
are
referring
equally
to
habeas
and
to
the
proceedings
brought
under
the
statutory
procedure,
the
uniform
post-conviction.
those
terms
have
been
used
interchangeably.
state
against
mcclary,
the
first
time
they
said
they
would
not
apply
elmore
retroactively
was
a
statutory
uniform
post-conviction
relief
act
proceeding.
they
have
drawn
no
distinction.
truesdale
v.
aiken,
the
skipper
case
that
this
court
summarily
reversed,
that
was
a
uniform
post-conviction
relief
statutory
proceeding
where
the
claim
had
been
raised
at
trial,
it
had
been
raised
on
direct
appeal,
it
had
been
raised
at
the
trial
level
in
collateral
attack,
and
there
was
never
a
habeas
proceeding.
the
distinction
that
the
state
has
attempted
to
create
between
a
state
constitutional
habeas
corpus
remedy
that
was
utilized
here
and
post-conviction
relief
is
simply
a
creation
of
counsel
for
the
respondent.
it
is
not
to
be
found
in
south
carolina
law,
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
find
it
in
this
opinion,
except
perhaps
arguably
where
there
is
as
in
this
case
an
essentially
imaginary
retroactivity
issue.
justice
stevens
inquired
whether
or
not
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
ever
recognized
that
sandstrom
is
involved
here,
and
the
answer
to
that
is,
yes.
there
are
two
cases,
both
of
them
are
cited
in
my
reply
brief.
one
is
state
against
peterson,
and
the
other
is
state
against
patrick,
both
of
which
refer
really
in
string
cites
or
in
something
like
string
cites
to
elmore,
francis
v.
franklin,
and
sandstrom
v.
montana,
as
all
standing
for
the
same
proposition.
i
don't
think
there
is
the
slightest
question
under
south
carolina
law
that
elmore
is
simply
the
application
of
sandstrom,
and
the
supreme
court
has
essentially
admitted
as
much
in
those
cases.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that's
all
i
have.
thank
you
very
much.
