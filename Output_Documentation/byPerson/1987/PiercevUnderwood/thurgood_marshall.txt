what
consideration
are
you
giving
a
hypothetical
case
where
everybody
agrees
that
you
cannot
lose...
and
you
lose?
justice
marshall
no.
the
trial
court
ruled
against
you
but
told
you
quietly
that
you
would
win
in
the
supreme
court,
and
the
highest
court
in
the
state
tells
you
the
same
thing.
then
you
come
up
here
and
you
lose
objective
indicators
of
reasonableness
theory
would
be
limited
to
things
that
are
on
the
record,
like
stays
and
grants
of
certiorari
and
decisions
by
judges.
i
don't
think
that
anything
like
a
wink
or
a
nod
or
a
private
communication
could
constitute
an
objective
indicator.
that's
what
i
say.
if
you
go
outside
the
record,
you
are
going
to
get
in
trouble.
justice
marshall
do
you
mean
because
it
makes
it
difficult?
justice
marshall
what
was
difficult
about
it?
justice
marshall
what
did
you
do,
other
than
go
back
and
forth
to
court?
you
didn't
do
any
research?
justice
marshall
all
you
did
was
go
to
court.
justice
marshall
how
long
did
that
take?
justice
marshall
how
long
did
it
take
to
do
what
you
were
just
talking
about?
justice
marshall
three
months?
justice
marshall
how
many
claims?
justice
marshall
how
many
claims
in
three
months?
justice
marshall
in
three
months?
justice
marshall
it's
a
shame
that
the
courts
can't
get
paid
like
everybody
else
does
in
this.
justice
marshall
that
is
a
problem.
