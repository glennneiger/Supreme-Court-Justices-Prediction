justice
scalia
is
there
any
reason
why
congress
didn't
use
the
perfectly
good
word
"reasonable",
if
it
meant
"reasonable"?
justice
scalia
mr.
merrill,
i
can
understand
your
search
for
objective
indicators
when
the
objective
indicators
are
those
that
pre-existed
the
government's
action
in
a
suit.
that
is
to
say,
if
it
is
a
matter
on
which
there
has
been
a
circuit
split,
before
this
particular
suit
is
litigated,
and
the
government
chooses
to
litigate
it,
i
would
acknowledge
that
a
sensible
litigator
would
say,
we
have
a
chance
of
winning.
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
you
are
relying
on
subsequent
views
of
the
court.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
no
more
significant
as
bearing
upon
the
intent
of
the
government
initially,
before
that
view
on
appeal
came
out,
i
mean
the
split
in
the
decision.
it
seems
to
me
that
had
no
bearing
upon
the
government's
judgment
at
the
time,
any
more
than
the
personal
views
of
the
district
judge.
justice
scalia
do
you
ever
think
you
could
win
a
case
that
it
was
unreasonable
to
litigate?
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
it
is
possible
to
begin
litigation
which
is
unreasonable,
and
you
were
foolish
to
do
it,
but
for
some
reason,
something
comes
up,
a
new
argument
is
developed,
and
you
win?
isn't
that
possible?
justice
scalia
well,
if
that
is
so,
then,
then
if
even
winning
the
case
does
not
prove
that
you
were
reasonable
to
begin
it
in
the
first
place,
how
can
the
mere
fact
that
some
of
the
judges
thought
you
should
have
won
it
prove
that
you
were
reasonable
to
bring
it
in
the
first
place?
justice
scalia
like
the
supreme
court
changing
its
mind.
you
know,
no
reasonable
lawyer
would
have
thought
that
we
were
ready
to
change
a
settled
course
of
law,
and
someone
takes
a
run
at
it,
and
it's
a
very
foolish
thing
to
do,
and
he
wins.
justice
scalia
you
would
like
it
to
be,
and
would
not
want
to
discourage
that,
would
you?
justice
scalia
--on
the
grant
of
the
stay,
the
mere
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
has
been
willing
to
apply
for
a
stay
shows
that
the
solicitor
general
thought
it
was
a
close
question,
and
he
is
a
reasonable
person.
can
you
think
of
any
other
area
in
which
we
decide
whether
a
particular
thing
is
reasonable
by
deciding
whether
any
reasonable
person
holds
that
position?
we
would
affirm
all
agency
action.
you
know,
the
test
is,
usually,
was
the
action
reasonable.
do
we
say
well,
of
course,
it
was
taken
by
a
cabinet
secretary.
that
is
a
reasonable
person.
therefore,
it
must
be
a
reasonable
action.
that
isn't
true.
reasonable
people
sometimes
do
unreasonable
things,
including
courts
that
sometimes
come
out
the
wrong
way.
right?
i
cannot
think
of
any
other
area
where
we
determine
reasonableness
on
the
basis
that
a
reasonable
person
did
it.
and
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
always
do
what
the
department
asks
it
to.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
so
that
means
it
had
two
losses
that
it
had
pursued
through
to
the
end,
right?
and
it
had
how
many
others
that
it
was
still
fighting?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
the
congress
meant,
and
you
say
the
prototype
it
had
in
mind
was
the
government
keeps
litigating
a
matter
it
has
lost.
it
really
had
finally
lost
only
two,
and
it
was
still
litigating
somewhat
less
than
eight.
surely
the
congress
didn't
mean
if
you
lost
one
district
court
case,
that
that
is
the
end
of
it,
or
two
district
court
cases,
even
though
you
have
eight
others
pending?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
that
committee
report
is
binding
on
us
as
to
the
meaning
of
"substantially
justification"?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
the
rest
of
congress
knew
what
that
case
was?
do
you
really
think
that
any
of
the
other
senators,
and
indeed
do
you
think
the
whole
committee
knew
what
that
case
had
held?
justice
scalia
surely
it
has
to
depend
on
what
the
report
says.
and
when
the
report
just
cites,
string-cites
a
number
of
cases,
to
really
assume
that
the
entire
committee
knew
what
all
those
cases
had
held,
much
less
that
the
whole
house
knew
what
they
had
held,
isn't
that
a
little
bit
fanciful?
justice
scalia
which
may
mean
we
don't
have
a
good
source.
justice
scalia
was
it
the
same
congress
that
wrote
this
report
that
had
adopted
the
language?
you
said
the
congress
can
tell
you
what
it
had
in
mind
as
though
congress
is
a
continuing
body
that
doesn't
change.
we
number
the
different
congresses
because
it
is
a
different
congress
each
time.
now,
was
it
the
same
one
that
wrote
this
report
that
had
adopted
the
language?
justice
scalia
is
the
conclusion
of
this
discussion
that
you
can
never
get
enhancement
in
eaja
cases,
since
the
only
time
you
get
fees
at
all
is
when
the
government's
case
is
not
substantially
justified?
justice
scalia
there
must
be
some
cases
in
which
even
though
the
government
is
not
substantially
justified
it
is
not
an
easy
case.
right?
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense,
but
it
has
to
be,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
finally,
pierce
versus
underwood
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
one
of
the
petitioner's
predecessors
as
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development
decided
not
to
implement
a
program
authorized
by
federal
statute,
which
was
intended
to
provide
payments
to
owners
of
government-subsidized
apartment
buildings
in
order
to
offset
rising
utility
expenses
and
property
taxes.
various
plaintiffs,
including
respondents
who
are
members
of
a
nationwide
class
of
housing
tenants,
successfully
challenged
that
decision
in
lawsuits
filed
in
nine
different
federal
district
courts.
after
two
of
these
district
court
decisions
were
affirmed
on
appeal,
a
newly
appointed
secretary
of
hud
settled
with
most
of
the
plaintiffs
including
respondents.
while
the
settlement
was
being
administered,
congress
passed
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
(eaja),
which
authorizes
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
against
the
government,
“unless
the
court
finds
that
the
position
of
the
united
states
was
substantially
justified”.
the
district
court
in
this
case
awarded
attorney's
fees
to
respondents
under
the
eaja
concluding
that
the
secretary's
decision
not
to
implement
the
operating-subsidy
program
had
not
been
substantially
justified.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
and
we
granted
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari.
the
case
raises
four
separate
issues.
first,
what
standard
of
review
should
the
court
of
appeals
use
when
reviewing
a
district
court's
determination
that
the
government's
position
was
or
was
not
substantially
justified.
we
conclude
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
in
applying
the
deferential
abusive-of-discretion
standard
rather
than
applying
the
de
novo
standard
and
giving
the
determination
plenary
review.
deferential
review
was
suggested
by
the
eaja's
language
structure
and
as
a
matter
of
sound
judicial
administration.
the
next
question
is,
what
does
the
phrase
“substantially
justified”
mean
as
used
in
the
eaja.
the
word
“substantial”
can
have
two
quite
different
connotations.
on
the
one
hand,
it
could
mean
considerable
in
amount
or
large,
on
the
other
hand,
it
can
mean
for
the
most
part
or
in
the
main,
as
for
example,
in
the
statement
what
he
said
was
substantially
true.
we
conclude
that
this
latter
connotation
is
correct
and
that
substantially
justified
means
justified
in
substance
or
in
the
main
that
is
justified
to
a
degree
that
would
satisfy
a
reasonable
person.
this
interpretation
accords
with
related
uses
of
the
term
substantial
and
is
the
standard
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
vast
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
third
question
is,
did
the
district
court
abuse
its
discretion
in
deciding
that
the
secretary's
position
in
this
case
was
not
substantially
justified.
we
conclude
that
it
did
not.
the
government's
arguments
on
the
merits
of
the
underlying
issue
do
not
command
the
conclusion
that
its
position
was
substantially
justified,
therefore,
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
is
affirmed.
finally,
we
turned
to
the
problem
of
calculating
the
amount
of
attorney's
fees.
the
eaja
provides
that
fees
awarded
must
“be
based
upon
prevailing
market
rates
for
the
kind
and
quality
of
the
services
furnished
except
that
fees
shall
not
be
awarded
in
excess
of
$75
per
hour,
unless
the
court
determines
that
an
increase
in
the
cost
of
living
or
a
special
factor
such
as
the
limited
availability
of
qualified
attorneys
for
the
proceedings
involved
justifies
a
higher
fee."
we
conclude
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
awarding
fees
at
a
rate
in
excess
of
$75
per
hour
adjusted
for
inflation.
in
order
to
give
any
substantial
effect
to
the
statute's
$75
cap
on
fees,
the
special
factors
referred
to
in
the
statute
must
be
such
as
are
not
of
broad
and
general
application.
the
factors
relied
on
by
the
district
court
here
such
as
the
work
and
ability
of
counsel
and
the
contingent
nature
of
the
fee
do
not
qualify.
we
therefore
affirm
in
part,
vacate
in
part
and
remand.
the
chief
justice
and
justice
stevens
joined
the
opinion
of
the
court.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
joined.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
o'connor
joins.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part.
