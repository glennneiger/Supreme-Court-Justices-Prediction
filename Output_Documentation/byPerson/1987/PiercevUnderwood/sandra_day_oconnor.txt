justice
o'connor
mr.
merrill,
may
i
ask
what
standard
we
should
use
to
review
the
lower
court's
finding
that
the
government's
litigating
position
was
not
substantially
justified?
is
it
an
abuse
of
discretion
thing
or
do
we
look
at
it
de
novo
as
a
matter
of
law,
or
does
it
vary
from
case
to
case,
depending
on
whether
it
is
a
matter
of
failure
to
meet
a
burden
of
proof
or
a
legal
question?
justice
o'connor
mr.
merrill,
do
you
agree
with
the
respondent
that
in
every
case,
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
question
of
whether
its
position
was
substantially
justified?
justice
o'connor
mr.
merrill,
was
that
view
of
when
we
grant
stays
clear
in
the
1970s
at
the
time
this
particular
stay
was
entered?
do
you
think
that
it
was
crystal
clear
that
that
was
the
criterion
we
would
use?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
that
is
perfectly
clear
now.
but
of
course,
the
concern
is
that
at
the
time
this
one
was
granted,
maybe
the
court
was
just
concerned
about
the
dispersal
of
the
money,
as
justice
stevens
had
suggested.
justice
o'connor
mr.
merrill,
i
have
a
little
concern
that
if
we
were
to
place
the
amount
of
weight
that
you
would
have
us
place
on
a
grant
of
certiorari
or
a
stay
here,
which,
as
has
been
indicated,
we
often
do
out
of
substantial
deference
to
the
request
of
the
solicitor
general,
that
we
would
have
to
change
our
posture
on
that
if
we
knew
that
then
that
was
going
to
be
determinative
in
a
later
fee
application
under
eaja.
and
i
just
wonder
if
that
is
wise?
justice
o'connor
do
we
also
need
to
look
at
the
underlying
litigation
issue
in
litigation
to
know
whether
the
government's
position
was
reasonable,
and
look
at
such
things
as
the
fact
that
the
language
was
permissive
rather
than
mandatory,
and
so
forth,
in
the
statute,
to
determine
whether
that
was
reasonable
to
litigate?
justice
o'connor
must
we
do
so,
too?
do
you
agree
that
we
should
make
a
de
novo
review
here?
justice
o'connor
but
of
necessity,
we
will
have
to
know
what
our
standard
of
review
is
or
we
couldn't
apply
the
proper
one
here.
isn't
that
so?
we
have
to
apply
the
proper
standard.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
it
is
really
a
question
of
law?
justice
o'connor
what
is
our
standard
of
review
if
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact?
