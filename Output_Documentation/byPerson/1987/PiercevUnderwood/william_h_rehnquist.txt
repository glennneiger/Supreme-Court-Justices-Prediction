chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
now
in
number
86-1512,
samuel
r.
pierce
versus
myrna
underwood.
mr.
merrill,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you
can't
take
into
consideration
any
subsequent
events
like
lawsuits
analyzing
the
government's
contentions,
and
the
court
opinion,
then
i
suppose
that
the
district
court
deciding
has
simply
got
to
study
the
law
as
it
existed
and
almost
make
a
brand
new
lawsuit
out
of
the
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
merrill.
we
will
hear
now
from
ms.
burdick.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
take
it
that
means
there
were
two
appeals
to
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
government
did
not
appeal
the
adverse
rulings
from
the
other
eight
district
judges?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
at
any
rate,
of
all
the
district
court
judgments
against
the
government,
only
two
were
appealed,
and
in
both
of
those,
only
two
finally
produced
opinions
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
both
those
were
adverse
to
the
government?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
committee
report,
ms.
burdick,
had
said,
what
if
the
statute
said
in
so
many
words,
congress
directs
the
courts
to
award
attorneys'
fees
to
the
prevailing
litigants
in
all
of
these
particular
cases?
do
you
think
we
would
then
have
to
go
ahead
and
do
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
congress
tell
a
court,
with
respect
to
a
specific
case,
that
we
want
you
to
each
thus
and
such
a
result?
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
are
now
before
us.
chief
justice
rehnquist
wasn't
that
partly
the
nature
of
the
case?
when
congress
has
appropriated
a
certain
amount
of
money
and
the
government
says
well,
we
don't
have
to
contract
for
it,
or
whatever
the
government
said
here,
you're
not
going
to
settle
a
case
like
that,
if
the
congress
has
appropriated
$60
million,
you
are
not
going
to
settle
it
for
$40
million.
i
mean,
if
the
government
settles
at
all,
aren't
you
just
bound
to
get
the
face
amount
in
that
particular
situation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
part
of
the
ninth
circuit's
or
the
district
court's
reliance
on
this
the
fact
that
it
was
a
lawsuit
against
the
government
as
opposed
to
somebody
else?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
would
be
an
argument
in
every
eaja
case,
because
all
you
get
attorneys'
fees
from
is
the
government.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
then
it
was
not
used
as
a
factor
simply
that
this
was
a
case
against
the
government,
but
it
was
this
particular
kind
of
case
against
the
government?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
here
didn't
totally
defer
to
the
district
court's
award.
the
district
court
gave
you
a
multiplier,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
burdick.
mr.
merrill,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
merrill.
the
case
is
submitted.
