justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
in
that
connection,
do
you
think
that
the
judge
who
tried
the
case,
or
the
court
of
appeals
that
might
have
handled
the
appeal,
the
feeling
of
that
judge
as
to
the
difficulty
of
the
issues,
how
close
they
were,
and
so
forth,
is
that
one
of
the
objective
factors
that
would
be
counted,
or
not?
justice
stevens
what
if
the
district
judge
said,
i
don't
see
how
any
reasonable
attorney
could
have
brought
this
case,
based
on
my
study
of
the
law
in
the
case
and
the
arguments
on
both
sides?
you
would
say
that?
justice
stevens
i
am
no
suggesting
it
is
necessarily
conclusive.
but
would
it
be
one
of
the
factors
that
would
be
appropriately
weighed?
justice
stevens
by
the
judge
and
by
the
court
of
appeals?
its
own
reaction
to
the
case?
justice
stevens
well,
i
am
asking,
is
this
one
of
the
objective
indicators?
justice
stevens
it's
not.
justice
stevens
assume
it
is
a
case
of
first
impression.
the
issue
has
never
arisen
before.
what
else
could
he
or
she
look
at?
justice
stevens
no,
of
course
not.
justice
stevens
i
think
judges
very
frequently
decide
one
way
but
acknowledge
to
themselves
that
the
case
was
not
an
easy
one.
that
is
certainly
not
an
unusual
situation
for
a
judge
to
be
in.
justice
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
on
the
stay,
just
reflecting,
i
don't
remember
the
particular
application,
but
this
is
a
case
that
involved
a
great
deal
of
money,
did
it
not?
fifty
or
sixty
or
seven
million
dollars?
justice
stevens
and
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
if
the
judgments
were
not
stayed,
the
money
would
be
disbursed
and
it
couldn't
have
been
recovered,
which
is
a
very
powerful
reason
for
granting
a
stay
without
looking
too
closely
at
the
merits.
justice
stevens
the
government
also
comes
in
in
these
cases.
don't
we
almost
routinely
grant
the
stays
with
that
kind
of
fact
pattern?
justice
stevens
isn't
there
another
factor,
too,
mr.
merrill,
in
all
candor?
i
think
the
court
does
have
great
respect
for
your
office.
and
when
your
office
comes
in
and
represents
that
there
is
a
substantial
question
here,
that
carries
a
good
deal
of
weight.
it
does
with
me,
i
can
very
candidly
say.
and
so
you
have
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
representing
to
this
court
that
there
is
a
substantial
question
involved
and
$60
million
is
going
to
be
disbursed
and
cannot
be
recovered.
you
may
not
go
into
the
details
of
complicated
statutory
case
very
closely,
but
there
were
representations
that
you
might
in
another
case,
in
all
candor.
n1--
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question
there.
does
the
fact...
in
the
first
part
of
your
argument,
you
are
persuading
us
that
there
really
was
no
merit
to
the
government's
case.
it
is
pretty
obvious
that
it
was
a
weak
case.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
kind
of
case
a
lawyer
will
be
glad
to
grab
on
to
when
there
is
a
lot
of
money
at
the
end
of
the
line.
justice
stevens
so
you
seem
to
be
arguing
in
the
second
part
of
your
argument
that
it
is
really
a
tough
case.
it's
hard
to
find
lawyers
to
handle
this.
justice
stevens
was
this
realistically
the
kind
of
case
in
which,
apart
from
eaja,
you
could
get
lawyers
to
handle
except
on
a
pro
bono
basis?
justice
stevens
but
isn't
the
fact
that
there
are
no
pro
bono
lawyers
available,
doesn't
that
satisfy
the
statutory
requirement?
