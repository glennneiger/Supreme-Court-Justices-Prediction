ms.
mary
s.
burdick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
analysis
of
the
issue
of
whether
plaintiffs'
counsel
will
receive
any
fees
turns
on
the
meaning
of
two
words:
"substantial
justification".
analysis
of
how
much
plaintiffs'
counsel
will
receive
turns
on
two
more
words:
"special
factors".
these
seemingly
simple
words
unfortunately
have
spawned
complicated
and
prolonged
litigation.
fortunately,
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
that
congress
had
some
specific
factual
contexts
and
patterns
in
mind
when
it
selected
these
words.
today,
i
would
like
to
focus
my
argument
on
the
legislative
history
and
specifically
on
the
fact
patterns
which
congress
said
it
was
contemplating
when
it
chose
the
words
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act.
as
this
court
said
in
garcia
v.
united
states,
and
in
blum
versus
stenson,
committee
reports
are
the
best
source
of
legislative
history
for
the
intent
of
congress.
in
this
case,
both
the
house
and
the
senate
reports
contain
very
concrete
examples
of
the
fact
patterns
of
objective
indicia
congress
was
contemplating
when
it
adopted
the
equal
access
to
justice
act.
the
first,
and
most
often-repeated
example,
from
the
legislative
history,
is
when
the
government
persists
in
pressing
claims
that
have
already
been
rejected
in
the
courts.
in
this
case,
the
complaint
was
not
filed
until
the
government
had
lost
nine
consecutive,
basically
identical
cases.
by
the
time
this
case
was
settled,
ten
district
court
judges
and
six
court
of
appeal
judges
had
unanimously
rejected
the
government's
position.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
there
were
other
appeals
pending
which
were
abandoned
and
remanded
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
of
all
of
the
nationwide
actions
on
the
operating
subsidy
issue.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
the
government
appealed
every
judgment
below
that
it
could.
some
were
not
in
appealable
posture.
and
it
abandoned
those
appeals
only
at
the
time
of
settlement.
despite
this
string
of
losses--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--i
believe
there
were
appeals
pending
in
eight
cases.
eight
or
fewer.
there
were
eight
cases
the
government
had
lost
below.
as
many
of
those
as
were
in
appealable
posture
had
been
appealed.
i
don't
remember
the
number.
two
were
lost
on
appeal...
abrams
and
dubose.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
no.
what
congress
said
was,
repeated
losses
may
be
evidence
that
the
government
had
a
weak
case.
now,
interestingly,
the
string
of
operating
subsidy
losses
was
given
by
one
committee
of
congress
as
a
specific
example
of
unjustified
repeated
losses
by
the
government.
in
1984,
when
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
was
being
debated
for
revival,
the
senate
committee
on
the
judiciary
said,
quote:
"to
ignore
precedent
is
not
a
substantially
justified
position.
"
close
quote.
and
they
gave
three
cases
as
examples.
one
of
those
cases
was
dubose
v.
pierce.
dubose
was
the
third
loss
the
government
suffered
in
the
consecutive
string
of
nine
losses
which
preceded
underwood,
which
it
also
lost.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
think
that
committee
report
is
very
strong
evidence
of
what
congress
meant
when
it
said
"substantial
justification".
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
know
that
this
court
has
said
that
committee
reports
are
the
best
source
of
legislative
history
because
you
assume
that
members
of
congress
know
the
law
and
know
what
is
in
the
committee
reports.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
it
is
the
best
source
we
have
to
determine
what
congress
may
have
meant.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
understand
there
is
a
split
in
the
court
on
this
issue.
despite
this
consecutive
string
of
losses,
the
secretary
argues
that
his
position
must
have
been
substantially
justified
because
this
court
issued
a
stay.
now,
we
don't
dispute
that
in
the
proper
circumstances,
issuance
of
a
stay
can
be
evidence
that
the
government's
position
was
or
was
not
substantially
justified.
however,
this
stay
was
not
given
substantial
weight
for
the
very
good
reason
that
it
was
issued
with
no
statement
of
reasons.
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
you
stayed
the
injunction
because
you
thought
the
government's
position
had
merit,
or
whether
you
stayed
the
injunction
because
if
you
did
not
do
so
the
case
would
be
mooted
and
the
$60
million
would
already
have
been
expended
before
the
case
came
before
you
on
the
merits.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
government
did
something
for
which
it
should
be
punished,
by
entry
of
a
fee
award
when
it
decided
to
pursue
all
ten
cases
to
final
resolution.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
government
was
engaging
in
a
pattern
of
litigation
strategy
that
congress
has
identified
as
a
situation
that
required
a
shifting
of
the
cost
of
litigation
from
those
people
who
prevailed
in
court
to
the
government
in
the
form
of
an
award
of
attorneys'
fees.
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
the
issue
of
the
legislative
history
that
mentioned
the
dubose
case,
that
the
existence
of
that
committee
report
was
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
second
circuit.
therefore,
i
think
the
split
between
the
second
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
operating
subsidy
issue
is
possibly
explainable
simply
son
the
ground
that
more
information
on
legislative
history
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
it
had
a
better
basis
for
reaching
its
conclusion.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
think
that
would
be
very
strong
evidence
that
that
was
congress'
intent
that
when
the
government
persisted
in
litigating
the
way
it
did
the
operating
subsidy
case,
that
fees
were
appropriate.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
no,
it
cannot.
but
it
can
give
you
a
idea
of
the
kind
of
cases
it
had
in
mind
when
it
said
if
the
government
is
not
substantially
justified
fees
should
be
awarded.
and
i
think
it
is
very
telling
that
one
of
the
examples
that
they
had
in
mind
was
this
very
string
of
cases.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
yes.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
no,
it
was
not.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
in
any
equal
access
case,
i
believe
the
district
court
judge
does
have
to
unavoidably
re-examine
the
strength
and
weakness
of
the
government's
case.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
no,
i
do
not.
and
the
solicitor
had
not
asked
the
court
to
review
the
standard
of
review
below,
and
so
we
did
not
brief
whether
or
not
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit
used
the
proper
standard,
which
was
not
de
novo
but
abuse
of
discretion.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
it
is
not
really
a
question
of
law.
below
in
the
district
court,
when
the
nationwide
injunction
was
first
sought,
there
was
considerable
evidence
about
the
cost
of
implementing
the
program,
about
the
wisdom
of
the
program,
and
then
there
was
analysis
of
the
statute.
and
the
district
court
judge
reached
a
conclusion
which
was
really
a
mix
of
law
and
fact.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
think
the
analysis
has
turned
on
what
are
the
practical
implications
of
having
a
de
novo
review
or
leaving
the
initial
determination
appropriately
with
the
district
court
judge,
which
was
analyzed,
i
believe,
fairly
well
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
alliance
for
justice,
aclu,
and
i
would
join
in
the
arguments
that
they
made
there
on
these
practical
implications.
this
court,
for
example,
has
said
repeatedly
that
attorneys'
fees
litigation
should
be
simplified
and
appeals
on
attorneys'
fees
issues
should
be
discouraged.
giving
deference
to
the
district
court's
determinations
on
fee
issues
would
serve
this
policy.
congress
set
forth
some
other
factual
patterns
which
they
said
evidenced
that
the
government's
position
was
not
substantially
justified,
in
addition
to
persisting
with
unsuccessful
claims.
one
of
those
was
whether
the
government
settled
the
case
on
terms
which
were
extremely
favorable
to
the
opposing
party,
evidencing
that
the
government
recognized
it
did
not
have
a
strong
case.
in
this
case,
the
settlement
gave
to
plaintiffs
every
penny
they
could
have
received
in
court.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
not
necessarily.
by
the
time
we
sat
down
to
talk
about
settlement,
congress
had
identified
and
approved
some
other
uses
for
the
reserve
fund.
it
would
have
been
quite
possible
that
we
would
have
settled
for
a
lesser
amount
than
was
in
the
reserve
fund
for
operating
subsidies,
agreeing
that
the
remaining
amount
could
be
used
for
new
subsidies
created
by
congress
after
the
initial
decision
below.
finally,
congress
also
said,
through
its
committee
reports,
that
one
way
that
you
can
see
through
an
objective
indicator
whether
the
government's
position
was
weak
or
strong
was
whether
the
district
court
below
was
able
to
resolve
the
case
on
the
merits
easily.
in
this
case,
we
went
in
in
a
nationwide
class
action
and
sought
only
a
preliminary
injunction
for
prospective
relief.
the
district
court
judge
was
so
persuaded
that
the
government's
case
was
without
merit
that,
sua
sponte,
he
treated
our
motion
as
a
motion
for
permanent
injunction
under
summary
judgment,
he
issued
a
nationwide
permanent
injunction
and
certified
a
nationwide
action.
if
prevailing
parties
are
ever
going
to
be
entitled
to
an
equal
access
award,
on
the
ground
that
they
opposed
a
government
position
which
was
not
substantially
justified,
as
congress
understood
those
terms,
this
must
be
the
case.
i
would
like
to
then,
then,
to
how
much
we
would
be
entitled
to.
the
operative
language
here
is
"special
factors".
in
the
statute,
congress
gave
one
very
concrete
example
of
a
special
factor
which
justifies
an
award
in
excess
of
$75.00
per
hour,
and
that
is
the
limited
availability
of
qualified
attorneys.
we
introduced
below
uncontroverted
evidence
for
the
commonsense
proposition
that
there
is
an
extremely
small
pool
of
attorneys
who
will
undertake
nationwide
class
actions
against
the
government
on
behalf
of
plaintiffs
who
will
not
be
paying
on
a
fee
for
service
basis,
win
or
lose.
on
this
basis
alone,
the
full
award
was
affirm
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
should
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
think
the
idea
was
that
the
suit
was
against
a
party
who
could
be
expected
to
bring
substantial
resources
and
who
had
already
evidenced
that
they
intended
to
take
the
case
as
far
as
they
could
go
on
appeal.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
but
in
the
majority
of
eaja
cases,
the
issue
is
simply
disability
payments.
as
many
of
the
amici
pointed
out,
the
most
common
eaja
case
is
a
disability
case
against
the
social
security
administration.
in
fact,
there
is
a
pool
of
attorneys
who
will
take
these
cases,
even
though
they
are
against
the
government,
and
the
pool
is
not
limited.
it
is
not
just
the
fact
that
the
government
is
the
opposing
counsel.
it
is
the
fact
that
it
is
a
nationwide
class
action
where
the
government
has
already
shown,
through
litigation
strategy,
that
they
intend
to
use
the
case
as
a
test
case
for
the
limits
of
their
discretion.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
that's
right.
you
are
correct.
every
eaja
case
is
against
the
government.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
well,
interestingly
enough,
no
one
grabbed
on
to
this
case
except
our
program.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
what
made
it
tough
was
first,
that
the
government
had
decided
to
use
it
a
test
case,
so
that
it
became
protracted
and
difficult.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
what
made
it
a
hard
case
was
the
fact
that
it
evolved
into
a
six-year
settlement
process
which
required
plaintiff's
counsel
to
undertake
what
the
district
court
judge
said
was--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--the
fact
that
we
are
going
to
be
paid
should
be
irrelevant.
the
issue
is
who
would
have
taken
this
case.
we
were
not
paid
by
plaintiffs,
and
so
the
pool
of
attorneys
available
to
plaintiffs
was
extremely
limited.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
yes,
the
district
court
did.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended,
first
of
all,
that
there
be
other
factors,
having
adopted
the
language--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--in
this
instance,
the
legislative
history
does
not
tell
us
if
the
paradigm
examples
that
congress
had
in
mind--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--i
think
the
factors
the
district
court
used
were
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind.
and
i
think
that
your
analysis--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--because
the
case,
by
the
time
it
ended,
after
six
years
of
settlement
administration,
proved
to
be
difficult,
complex--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--it
wasn't
protracted.
the
district
court
judge
said
that
it
was
difficult,
during
the
six
years
that
he
spent
watching
the
case.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
no,
there
was
no
chance
we
were
going
to
lose.
but
the
issue
is
how
great
was
the
burden
on
counsel
and
what
is
a
fair
compensation
for
the
work
that
they
had
to
do.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
that
is
the
logical
extension
of
the
government's
argument,
that
if
the
government
is
not
substantially
justified,
you
necessarily
are
going
to
lose.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
whether
it
is
an
easy
case
or
not--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--congress
intended
that
there
would
be
cases
where
plaintiff's
counsel
would
be
awarded
more
than
$75.00
per
hour,
because
it
expressly
said,
if
there
are
special
factors,
more
shall
be
awarded.
i
think
this
court's
analysis
of
legislative
history
in
lorillard
v.
ponds
gives
us
our
best
analytic
framework
for
determining
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
talked
about
special
factors.
this
court
said
in
lorillard
that
when
congress
re-enacts
statutory
language,
we
are
to
assume
that
congress
intended
to
adopt
judicial
interpretation
of
the
re-adopted
statutory
language,
absent
some
directive
from
congress
that
it
had
a
different
intention.
you
said
in
lorillard
that
this
assumption
is
especially
strong
when
congress
evidences
through
the
committee
reports
an
understanding
of
the
evolving
case
law.
re-adoption
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
is
a
classic
example
of
this
legislative
process
of
the
re-adoption
of
statutory
language.
for
more
than
a
year,
the
congressional
committees
debated
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
and
they
reported
on
and
reviewed
in
their
committee
reports
more
than
50
court
decisions,
criticizing
more
than
20
of
those
decisions,
all
because
they
were
too
restrictive
of
fee
awards.
the
committees
did
not
criticize
any
of
the
then
existing
precedents
which
allowed
for
award
of
more
than
$75.00
per
hour,
because
of
special
factors.
the
existing
precedents
at
the
time
of
the
re-enactment
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
were:
action
on
smoking
and
health
v.
c.a.b.,
a
d.c.
circuit
decision,
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmance
in
this
very
case,
underwood.
in
action
on
smoking
v.
c.a.b.,
the
d.c.
circuit
said
that
exceptional
quality
of
representation,
contingency
and
delay
could
be
special
factors.
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
said
exceptional
quality
of
representation,
exceptional
success
complexity,
difficulty,
duration
and
again,
contingency,
could
be
special
factors.
in
addition,
the
committees
heard
the
testimony
that
courts
were
awarding
more
than
$75.00
per
hour
to
attorneys
who
provided
extraordinary
services
in
complex
and
protracted
cases.
armed
with
this
knowledge,
congress
re-enacted
the
words
"special
factors"
without
change
and
without
comment.
thus,
we
are
compelled
by
a
common-sense
rule
of
statutory
construction
to
assume
that
when
congress
re-adopted
the
words
"special
factors",
it
understood
those
special
factors
to
include
exceptional
representation,
exceptional
success,
contingency,
delay
and
difficulty
of
the
case.
as
the
district
court
judge
in
the
ninth
circuit
recognized,
this
is
a
case
raising
every
single
one
of
those
special
factors,
as
well
as
the
one
special
factor
which
congress
stated
in
the
statute:...
limited
availability
of
qualified
counsel.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
no,
that's
not
what
i
mean.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
let
me
give
you
a
few
examples.
the
settlement
required
the
government
to
give
to
plaintiffs'
counsel
a
list
of
all
4,000
housing
projects
where
plaintiff's
were
entitled
to
receive
subsidies.
after
signing
the
settlement,
the
government
proved
unable
to
turn
over
such
a
list,
and
we
spent
a
year
going
through
hearings
back
and
forth
trying
to
determine
why
we
didn't
have
a
list,
how
we
could
get
the
information--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--no,
we
didn't
do
any
research.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
let
me
give
an
example
of
what
we
did
outside
of
court.
more
than
150,000
applications
for
past
benefits
were
filed.
the
attorneys
on
the
case
took
a
random
sample
of
those,
reviewed
those
applications
and
determined
what
reasonably
we
could
require
in
terms
of
evidence
that
the
person
making
the
claim
actually
resided
in
the
apartment
and
lived
in
the
apartment
during
the
period--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--the
settlement
was
signed
in
1979
and
the
first
checks
were
mailed
out
in
1981.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
about
three
months.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
for
reviewing
the
claims,
coming
up
with
the--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--pardon?
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
i
believe
that
we
reviewed
several
hundred
claims.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
then
we
came
up
during
that
same
period
with
a
procedures
manual
that
the
accounting
firm
could
use
what
would
give
them
guidelines
as
to
what
evidence
was
acceptable
and
what
was
not.
we
took
those
to
the
court.
we
argued
to
the
court
whether
those
were
acceptable
standards.
then
we
let
the
accounting
firm
try
it
for
a
while.
they
brought
back
to
us
the
cases
that
our
general
rules
did
not
help
them
resolve.
we
then
refined
the
rules,
went
back
to
the
court,
got
approval
on
the
refined
rules.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
urge
the
court
to
highlight
the
deference
that
should
be
given
to
the
district
courts'
findings
on
attorneys'
fees.
if
appellate
courts
are
directed
to
defer
to
the
district
courts--
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
--fewer
appeals
will
be
taken.
and
if
fewer
appeals
are
taken,
we
hope
that
counsel
will,
instead
of
litigating
fees,
spend
their
time
doing
what
congress
was
trying
to
encourage...
representing
people
who
otherwise
would
be
shut
out
of
the
courts.
ms.
mary
s.
burdick
that
is
right.
the
court
of
appeals
here
first
said
as
a
matter
of
law,
eaja
does
not
provide
for
multipliers.
it
then
modified
its
decision
and
said
it
chose
not
to
reach
that
issue
and
that
we
were
adequately
compensated
by
the
market
rate
award
that
we
received.
thank
you.
