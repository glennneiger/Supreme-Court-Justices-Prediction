mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
the
court's
first
encounter
with
the
unique
attorneys'
fee
statute,
the
equal
access
to
justice
act,
or
eaja.
eaja
reflects
an
attempt
by
congress
to
balance
two
competing
objectives.
on
the
one
hand,
congress
was
concerned
that
individuals
and
small
businesses
might
be
discouraged
from
challenging
unreasonable
government
action
because
they
could
not
afford
the
expense
of
hiring
an
attorney.
on
the
other
hand,
congress
thought
that
if
attorneys'
fees
were
routinely
awarded
against
the
government
in
a
case
where
the
government
was
not
the
prevailing
party,
this
might
inhibit
vigorous
enforcement
of
the
law,
or
chill
attempts
by
the
government
to
advance
in
good
faith
novel
but
credible
extensions
and
interpretations
of
the
law.
in
an
effort
to
accommodate
these
two
competing
objectives,
congress
adopted
two
provisions
which
are
both
at
issue
in
this
case.
first,
eaja
does
not
award
attorneys'
fees
to
everyone
who
prevails.
it
specifically
provides
that
an
award
of
fees
is
available
only
if
the
government
takes
a
position
that
is
not
substantially
justified.
second,
although
eaja
provides
that
an
attorney's
fee
must
be
reasonable,
it
imposes
a
cap
on
what
is
considered
to
be
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
equal
to
$75.00
an
hour,
which
can
be
exceeded
only
because
of
inflation
or
other
narrowly
defined
special
factors.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
other
special
factors
such
as.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes.
i
hope
to
get
to
that
issue
later
in
my
argument,
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
first
issue
in
this
case,
however,
is
the
meaning
of
"substantial
justification".
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
in
general
the
government's
position
is
substantially
justified
if
it
is
reasonable.
thus,
even
if
the
government
ultimately
loses
the
case,
it
is
not
required
to
pay
attorneys'
fees
under
eaja
if
its
position
was
one
as
to
which
reasonable
persons
might
genuinely
disagree
about
the
outcome.
the
1980
legislative
history
repeatedly
equates
substantial
justification
with
reasonableness.
eleven
courts
of
appeals
interpreted
"substantially
justified"
to
mean
"reasonable".
when
eaja
was
re-enacted
in
1985,
several
minor
changes
were
made
in
the
statutory
language,
but
congress
maintained
the
substantial
justification
formula
without
modification.
thus,
we
think
that
the
meaning
of
"substantial
justification",
at
least
in
the
abstract,
is
clear.
it
means
"reasonable".
the
difficulty
comes
in
applying
this
standard
in
individual
cases,
as
this
case
illustrates.
here,
looking
at
virtually
identical
facts,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
secretary
of
hud
was
not
substantially
justified
in
refusing
to
implement
the
operating
subsidy
program
authorized
by
congress
in
1974,
and
subsequently
repealed
in
1981.
the
second
circuit,
however,
held
that
the
secretary
was
substantially
justified
in
refusing
to
implement
that
subsidy.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
justice
scalia,
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
the
substantially
justified
formula
was
borrowed
verbatim
from
rule
37
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
i
think
there
is
also
some
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
was
particularly
attracted
to
that
because
it
was
clear
under
that
formulation
that
the
government
had
the
burden,
and
congress
was
particularly
anxious
to
establish
that
the
government
had
the
burden
of
showing
it
as
substantially
justified,
or
reasonable,
or
whatever.
now,
obviously,
they
could
have
done
that
by
saying
the
government
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
it
is
reasonable.
but
congress
chose
not
to
do
that.
there
is
an
episode
in
the
legislative
history,
the
1980
legislative
history,
which
is
discussed
in
the
briefs,
where
the
senate,
without
explanation,
the
senate
committee,
rejected
an
amendment
that
would
changed
"substantially
justified"
to
"reasonably
justified",
but
there
is
no
explanation
for
that.
and
the
senate
committee
report
goes
on
to
say
that
"substantially
justified"
means
"reasonable".
so
i
cannot
answer
the
question
any
better
than
that.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
in
this
case
we
think
the
second
circuit
was
right
and
the
ninth
circuit
wrong
in
the
substantial
justification
inquiry.
first
of
all,
the
secretary's
decision
not
to
implement
the
operating
subsidy
was
quintessentially
a
policy
choice
about
what
to
do
with
limited
resources.
although
congress
had
authorized
the
secretary
to
enter
into
contracts
to
implement
the
operating
subsidy
program,
it
had
not
released
sufficient
contract
authority
to
permit
the
secretary
to
implement
that
subsidy
program
and
to
meet
her
commitments
under
other
programs.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
ironically,
justice
white,
there
is
a
pending
application
or
motion,
i
guess,
before
the
district
court
in
california
to
award
fees
for
the
expense
of
engaging
in
the
fee
litigation
in
this
case;
and
if
our
theory
is
right
about
what
"substantially
justified"
means,
we
should
be
able
to
win
that
litigation
because
of
the
conflict
in
the
circuits.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
certainly
we
think
that
in
this
case
the
appropriate
standard
is
de
novo.
most
of
the
lower
courts
that
have
considered
this
question
have
so
concluded.
a
few
lower
courts,
including
the
ninth
circuit,
have
held
that
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
is
appropriate.
we
think
a
de
novo
standard
is
particularly
critical
at
this
stage,
or
with
respect
to
the
issues
involved
in
this
case,
because
the
primary
thrust
of
our
argument
here
is
that
the
court
should,
if
at
all
possible,
try
to
construe
the
"substantially
justified"
requirement
in
terms
of
objective
indicators
of
reasonableness,
and
if
the
courts
are
to
develop
such
objective
indicators
of
reasonableness,
it
is
important
that
we
have
appellate
review
of
decisions
as
to
what
kinds
of
circumstances
constitute
substantial
justification
and
which
kinds
do
not.
if
everything
is
simply
left
up
to
the
ad
hoc
discretion
of
the
trial
courts,
then
we
will
be
faced
with
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
kind
of
approach
in
almost
every
instance,
which
we
argue
is
highly
wasteful
and
duplicative.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no.
our
notion
of
objective
indicators
of
reasonableness
is
essentially
keyed
to
what
we
think
"reasonableness"
means.
"reasonableness"
means
that
a
reasonable
person
or
attorney
could
have
agreed
with
the
government's
position
at
the
outset
of
the
litigation.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we
do
not
think
that
would
be
an
objective
indicator
that
would
be
conclusive.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
in
a
case
where
there
is
no
objective
indicator
of
reasonableness--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--no,
it's
not.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we
understand
objective
indicators
of
reasonableness
to
be
something
which
basically
ends
the
argument
about
whether
the
government
was
substantially
justified
or
not.
i
don't
think
the
views
of
the
trial
judge
would
be
that
kind
of
factor.
i
think
that
in
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
case
where
you
didn't
have
an
objective
indicator,
that
would
certainly
be
something
that
would
be
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
in
that
kind
of
situation,
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
engage
in
a
kind
of
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis,
in
which
the
trial
judge's
subjective
reactions
to
the
case
obviously
loom
fairly
large.
bear
in
mind
that
eaja
does
not
say
that
the
government
is
not
substantially
justified
simply
because
it
failed
to
win
on
the
merits.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
and
it
is
a
little
bit
hard,
obviously,
for
district
judges,
having
just
ruled
against
the
government,
to
turn
around
and
say
well,
even
though
i
find
the
government
lost,
they
are
substantially
justified.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we
certainly
do
not
argue
that
every
case
can
be
resolved
by
objective
indicators
either
of
reasonableness
or
of
unreasonableness,
and
when
there
are
no
such
objective
indicators,
we
simply
think
that
the
lower
court's
approach
in
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
is
the
best
way
to
proceed
at
this
point
in
implementing
eaja.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes,
justice
o'connor,
we
do
agree
with
that.
that
is
clear
in
the
legislative
history,
that
congress
to
intended.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
it
has
no
bearing
on
the...
it
didn't
motivate
the
government,
clearly,
to
do
what
they
did,
by
definition.
the
even
does
not
happen
until
after
the
government
made
the
decision
to
litigate.
but
we
think
it
is
important
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
analytical
question
of
at
what
point
in
time
do
you
ask
whether
or
not
the
government
was
substantially
justified,
and
in
this
case
there
is
general
agreement
that
the
point
in
time
is
when
the
secretary
of
hud
decided
to
defend
against
this
nationwide
class
action
suit...
to
distinguish
between
that
issue
and
the
issue
of
what
kind
of
evidence
a
court
can
look
at,
in
order
to
make
up
its
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
a
reasonable
person
could
have
disagreed
about
the
government's
position.
we
think
that
evidence
which
emerges
or
develops
after
the
time
the
suit
is
instituted
can
be
very
highly
probative
on
that
question.
for
example,
if
there
were
no
circuit
split
when
the
case
was
filed
but
subsequently
one
developed,
we
think
that
certainly
that
would
be
relevant
evidence
that
sheds
light
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
government's
decision
to
have
litigated.
and
in
this
case,
we
think
that
the
fact
that
this
court
granted
a
stay
pending
review
as
subsequent
phase
of
the
litigation,
and
granted
certiorari
to
cases
raising
the
identical
issue,
is
highly
probative.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
excuse
me?
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes,
that
is
quite
possible.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
subsequent
developments,
i
think,
are
highly
probative
in
the
context
where
the
basic
legal
issues
are
the
same
when
the
subsequent
rulings
come
down
as
they
were
when
the
initial
decision
was
made.
and
i
think
that
although
there
were
some
modest
changes
in
the
statute
that
took
place
in
this
case,
the
basic
issues,
the
basic
statutory
language
was
the
same,
the
basic
rationale
that
the
secretary
gave
was
the
same.
and
so
this
court's
decision
to
grant
a
stay
pending
review
and
the
grants
of
certiorari,
we
think,
are
extremely
probative
of
the
question
of
whether
it
was
reasonable
for
the
government
to
essentially
defend
the
decision
of
the
secretary
in
the
first
place.
now,
you
are
right.
it
is
possible
to
imagine
a
case
where
something
happens,
congress
passes
a
new
statute
that
suddenly
changes
the
government's
position
so
that
it
is
no
longer
justified,
for
example.
those
kind
of
unique
cases
may
present
a
special
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
government
was
substantially
justified
in
persisting
with
the
litigation.
i
suppose
it
is
also
possible
to
imagine
a
situation
where
a
subsequent
event
could
change
the
landscape
such
that--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--yes.
i
think
it
is
analytically
possible
that
one
could
say
in
some
case...
i
don't
think
it
is
this
case...
but
in
some
case,
the
government
was
not
substantially
justified
at
the
outset,
but
then
the
legal
landscape
changed
and
it
became
substantially
justified.
i
don't
think
that
is
the
case
here
because
i
think
that
the
basic
elements
of
the
law
remain
unchanged
and
all
we
really
have
is
confirmation
through
this
court's
decision
and
through
the
grants
of
certiorari
of
the
reasonableness
of
a
decision
that
the
secretary
took
to
defend
the
case
in
the
first
place.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
it
would
be,
we
think,
quite
artificial
to
have
an
absolute
line
that
says
you
have
to
draw
the
veil
and
you
cannot
look
at
anything
that
happens
after
the
complaint
was
filed.
i
should
point
out
that
the
respondents
don't
agree
with
any
such
rule,
either
because
they
stress
the
fact
that
the
case
was
resolved
without
a
trial
and
that
there
was
ultimately
a
favorable
settlement
of
the
case
in
favor
of
plaintiffs
and
clearly
those
are
subsequent
events
that
occurred
after
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
the
settlement
certiorari.
so
both
sides
in
this
case
are,
in
effect,
arguing
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
no
party
in
this
case
is
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed
and
cannot
look
to
subsequent--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--what
do
you
mean,
justice
marshall,
by
everybody?
all
the
courts
that
have
considered
the
issue?
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that's
right.
and
in
fact,
congress,
in
its
1985
amendments...
congress
made
a
number
of
modest
amendments
in
1985.
one
of
them
was
to
make
it
clear
that
the
substantial
justification
inquiry
was
to
be
made
on
the
record
and
that
the
courts
were
not
to
essentially
take
additional
evidence
on
the
question
of
reasonableness.
in
any
event,
we
think
that
in
this
case,
although
there
are
several
indicators
that
support
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary...
the
discretionary
nature
of
the
policy
choice,
the
statutory
language,
the
fact
that
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
lindy
case
had
decided
only
one
year
before
on
basically
identical
statutory
language,
that
the
secretary
had
discretion
not
to
implement
the
larger
program
under
the
housing
act,
section
236,
that
was
at
issue,
that
the
secretary's
judgment
to
litigate
was
reasonable.
but
the
stay
and
the
certiorari
grants,
we
think,
not
only
confirm
that
judgment,
but
are
so
probative
that
they
constitute
objective
indicators
of
reasonableness.
now,
with
respect
to
the
stay,
we
say
that,
because
it
is
well
established
that
one
of
the
elements
that
a
party
has
to
show,
has
to
make
a
strong
showing
on
in
order
to
grant
a
stay,
is
a
showing
of
a
reasonable
possibility
of
success
on
the
merits.
so
that
is
a
necessary
element
of
a
stay
and
the
court
must
have
concluded
that
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
of
success
on
the
merits
when
it
granted
the
stay
in
the
underwood
case.
the
cert.
petition,
similarly,
there
was
no
conflict
in
the--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--it
involved
$60
million.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
don't
know.
i
can't
speak
to
that,
justice
stevens,
as
to
whether
it's
routine
or
not.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no,
not
at
all.
i
must
say
though,
that
although
we
would
concede
that
there
may
be
some
tradeoffs
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
grant
a
stay
between
the
balance
of
equities
or
the
irreparable
harm
element,
and
the
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits,
there
is
no
suggestion
in
any
of
the
justice's
in
chambers
opinions
or
in
any
of
the
decisions
about
stays,
that
a
showing
of
success
on
the
merits,
or
a
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits,
is
not
a
necessary
element
of
a
stay.
it
may
not
be
a
sufficient
element,
but
it
is
necessary.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
there
is
some
discussion
of
that
in
the
briefs,
justice
o'connor.
i
would
put
it
this
way.
i
think
that,
as
a
matter
of
logic,
it
was
clear.
it
was
clear
in
appeals,
for
example,
that
the
court
had
to
consider
probability
of
success
on
the
merits.
in
certiorari
cases,
the
court
would
frequently
speak
only
of
the
likelihood
that
four
justices
would
agree
to
grant
certiorari.
but
i
think
that
there
would
really
be
no
point
in
granting
a
stay,
even
if
one
concluded
in
a
strange
or
unusual
case
that
four
justices
wanted
to
grant
certiorari
only
to
affirm,
there
would
be
no
point
in
granting
a
stay
if
there
was
not
a
significant
chance
that
the
judgment
below
was
going
to
be
reversed.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
i
think
the
dispersal
of
the
money
probably
was
a
substantial
factor.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
perhaps
we
could
have
a
judgment
by
the
solicitor
general
to
be
an
objective
indicator
of
reasonableness
in
these
cases,
too,
justice
stevens.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
i
think
congress
clearly
did
not
intend
that
any
judgment
by
the
solicitor
general
or
by
any
responsible
cabinet
officer
would
be,
by
definition,
a
reasonable
act
under
eaja.
the
whole
point
of
eaja
was
to
make
sure
that
officials
of
the
government
thought
long
and
hard
before
they
took
action
and
therefore
that
the
incidence
of
unreasonableness
would
be
reduced.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we
certainly
would
not
want
the
court
to
change
its
standards
in
response
to
attorneys'
fee
litigation,
justice
o'connor.
the
stay
situation
is,
quite
frankly,
probably
somewhat
of
an
unusual
one
in
eaja
litigation.
i
think
that
a
much
more
common
situation
that
the
government
encounters
is
one
where
there
is
some
kind
of
disagreement
among
the
courts
on
the
question
and
our
approach
of
objective
indicators
i
think
would
only
in
an
unusual
case
involve
assessments
of
stay
and
certiorari
grants,
and
much
more
commonly
would
involve
things
like
whether
or
not
a
disagreement
among
lower
court
judges
was
sufficient
to
establish
the
reasonableness
of
the
government's
action.
there
are
really
two
issue
here.
one
is
whether
or
not
the
objective
indicators
approach
makes
sense,
as
a
general
matter,
and
secondly,
whether
or
not,
in
this
case,
the
stay
and
the
certiorari
grants
were
bona
fide
objective
indicators
of
reasonableness.
we
would
strongly
urge
the
court
to
consider
the
utility
of
the
objective
indicators
approach,
and
even
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us
about
the
stay
and
the
certiorari
grant,
we
think
that,
when
you
look
at
the
total
circumstances
in
this
case,
that
our
action
was
substantially
justified
from
that
perspective
as
well
as
under
an
objective
indicators
analysis.
let
me
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
second
issue
in
this
case,
which
is
whether
or
not
the
lower
courts
properly
adjusted
the
fees
to
levels
as
high
as
$120.00
an
hour.
eaja
is
unique
among
attorneys'
fee
statutes
in
that
it
imposes
an
cap
on
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
equal
to
$75.00
an
hour.
the
statute
sets
forth
two
exceptions
to
the
cap:
first
a
finding
that
there
has
been
an
increase
in
the
cost
of
living,
and
second,
a
finding
that
a
special
factor
such
as
the
limited
availability
of
qualified
counsel
for
the
proceedings
involved
requires
a
higher
fee.
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
we
think
all
but
wrote
the
$75.00
cap
out
of
the
statute.
in
effect,
they
found
that
the
eaja
permits
courts
to
look
to
any
and
all
of
the
12
factors
that
were
identified
in
johnson
v.
georgia
highway
express
in
making
upward
adjustments
above
and
beyond
the
$75.00
limit.
the
problem
with
this
approach
is
that
the
johnson
factors
were
designed
to
establish
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
in
a
situation
where
there
is
no
cap.
thus,
if
each
of
the
johnson
factors
can
be
taken
into
account
as
a
special
factor
which
justifies
an
increase
above
the
$75.00
limit,
the
net
effect
would
be
the
same
as
if
congress
had
mandated
no
cap
at
all.
moreover,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
eaja
that
suggests
that
congress
wanted
the
courts
to
look
at
the
12
johnson
factors
in
deciding
whether
to
go
beyond
the
$75.00
cap.
in
this
respect,
eaja
is
quite
different
from
the
civil
rights
attorneys'
fee
act,
42
u.s.c.
1988,
for
the
legislative
history,
as
this
court
has
recently
discussed
in
several
cases,
expressly
refers
to
and
incorporates
or
endorses
at
least
the
johnson
factors.
by
a
curious
logic,
the
respondents
have
said
that
they
are
entitled
to
more
than
$75.00
because
they
satisfied
the
one
special
factor
mentioned
in
the
statute...
to
wit,
the
limited
availability
of
qualified
counsel.
but
their
argument
is
that
there
was
a
limited
availability
of
attorneys
that
were
willing
to
serve
in
this
case
pro
bono.
they
have
not
submitted
any
evidence,
and
the
lower
courts
did
not
find,
that
there
was
a
limited
availability
of
counsel
at
established
market
rates
or
at
$75.00
an
hour.
that,
we
submit,
is
the
relevant
question
under
eaja,
and
the
fact
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
supporting
that
demonstrates
that
respondents
were
entitled
to
fees,
at
most,
no
higher
than
$75.00
per
hour.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
let
me
first
briefly
address
the
three
factors
that
respondents
have
relied
on
from
the
legislative
history
in
support
of
a
finding
that
the
government
was
no
substantially
justified
in
this
case.
first
is
the
string
of
district
court
opinions.
we
agree
that
in
the
proper
case,
where
you
have
a
subtle
body
of
authority,
that
would
be
something
to
be
taken
into
account
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
government
was
substantially
justified.
but
in
this
case,
what
you
had
was
a
string
of
district
court
decisions
that
were,
most
of
them,
associated
with
individual
housing
projects,
all
of
them
rendered
in
very
short
order,
one
after
the
other,
and
the
government
was
vigorously
trying
to
appeal
those
decisions
during
the
time
that
the
cases
were
being
rendered.
the
government's
choice,
if
it
wanted
to
obtain
appellate
review
in
this
situation,
was
quite
limited.
they
either
could
continue
to
fight
the
district
court
actions
until
they
got
appellate
decision
or
i
guess,
as
respondents
would
have
it,
we
could
just
simply
fold
up
and
concede
our
case
before
we
got
a
decision
on
appeal.
the
secretary
felt
very
strongly
that
appellate
review
was
warranted
and
so
incurred
the
additional
district
court
defeats.
i
should
point
out
that
in
response
to
some
questions
from
the
bench
as
to
how
many
final
judgments
there
were
against
the
secretary,
except
for
the
cases
that
were
not
appealed
on
the
district
court
level,
there
were
no
final
judgments.
the
two
cases
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
both
resulted
in
petitions
for
certiorari
that
were
granted,
and
before
those
cases
were
heard
on
the
merits,
the
nationwide
class
action
was
settled.
and
so
in
fact,
other
than
some
isolated
district
court
cases
where
the
government
elected
not
to
appeal,
there
was
no
body
of
finally-determined
law
in
existence
at
the
time
this
case
was
filed.
with
respect
to
the
settlement,
there
are
really
two
key
variables
in
understanding
the
settlement
in
this
case,
and
i
think
to
illustrate
why
it
is
dangerous
to
treat
a
settlement
as
an
objective
indicator
of
unreasonableness,
first
of
all,
in
1977,
congress
substantially
amended
the
operating
subsidy
statute.
first
of
all,
it
made
the
operating
subsidy
program
mandatory
as
to
the
future.
it
did
not
address
the
situation
from
1974
to
1977,
but
it
said
starting
in
1977,
it
is
mandatory
in
the
future.
secondly,
congress
made
it
clear
that
the
reserve
fund
that
had
been
accumulating...
this
was
the
source
for
the
$60
million...
could
be
spent
without
separate
release
of
contract
authority
from
congress.
the
secretary
up
to
that
time
had
taken
the
position
that
she
could
not
spend
the
reserve
fund
without
separate
contract
authority
from
congress.
so
in
light
of
that
clarification
of
the
law,
there
was
no
legal
impediment
to
distributing
the
$60
million
at
that
point
in
time,
there
was
no
real
dispute
on
an
ongoing
basis
about
the
policy
because
that
had
been
resolved
by
congress,
and
it
made
sense
to
settle
the
case.
secondly,
following
up
on
the
elections
of
1976,
there
was
a
new
secretary
of
hud.
and
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
policy
differences
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
decision
to
settle
the
case
here.
regarding
the
district
court's
ruling
sua
sponte
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs,
what
happened
was
there
was
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
that
was
fully
briefed
and
argued,
and
after
the
judge
decided
to
enter
a
preliminary
injunction,
the
judge
decided
there
would
be
no
point
in
hearing
additional
argument
on
a
permanent
injunction
and
so
entered
a
permanent
injunction
without
further
argument.
given
that
the
issues
involved
were
strictly
legal,
we
don't
think
this
sheds
any
light
one
way
or
another
on
the
weightiness
of
the
government's
argument.
turning
to
the
debate
about
attorneys'
fees,
and
whether
or
not
counsel
are
entitled
to
enhanced
fees
either
because
of
the
one
special
factor
identified
by
congress
or
because
of
the
johnson
factors,
several
points.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case,
as
respondent
suggests,
that
there
is
a
limited
supply
of
attorneys
who
would
have
taken
this
case
on
a
win
or
lose
basis.
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
was
that
there
was
a
limited
supply
of
counsel
who
would
take
the
case
on
a
pro
bono
basis,
and
that
we
submit
is
simply
not
the
relevant
question
under
eaja.
eaja
simply
indicates
that
if
there
would
be
difficulty
in
retaining
counsel--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--no,
i
don't
think
it
really
is,
without
eaja
or
some
other
basis
for--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--we
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens.
the
statute
basically
is
addressed
to
the
situation
where
an
attorney
has
been
hired
for
$85.00
or
$100.00
an
hour
and
the
statutory
cap
is
$75.00
an
hour.
and
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
that
additional
fee
was
necessary
in
order
to
attract
counsel
in
this
particular
case.
in
this
case,
you
had
counsel
hired
basically
for
nothing,
and
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
we
think
$75.00
is
an
adequate
fee
in
that
case,
not
whether
or
not
you
would
leapfrog
above
$75.00.
