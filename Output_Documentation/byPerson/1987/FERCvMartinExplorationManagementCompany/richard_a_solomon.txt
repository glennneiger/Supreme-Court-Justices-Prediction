mr.
richard
a.
solomon
may
it
please
the
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
the
petitioners
in
364,
the
public
service
commission
of
the
state
of
new
york,
the
associated
gas
distributors,
the
panhandle
eastern
pipeline,
and
the
tennessee
gas
pipeline,
have
joined
together
in
their
petition
here
because
what
we
believe
the
lower
court's
opinion
erroneously
has
done
is
to
prevent
pipelines
from
the
benefits
of
their
bargains
as
to
how
gas
should
be
priced
under
deregulation
while
at
the
same
time
allowing
producers
to
have
the
benefits
of
those
bargains,
and
unfairly
rasing
prices.
now,
we
agree
completely
with
the
position
taken
by
mr.
taranto
as
to
the
construction
of
101(b)(5).
we
would
point
out
that
for
the
court's
opinion
below
to
be
upheld,
it
is
not
sufficient
for
my
friends
over
here
to
demonstrate
that
their
construction
of
101(b)(5)
is
a
possible
one.
they
have
to
show
that
the
commission's
construction
of
101(b)(5)
is
an
impossible
one,
because
if
101(b)(5)
is
subject
to
two
interpretations
we
think
it's
clear
for
reasons
detailed
in
the
commission's
brief
and
our
brief
that
of
the
two
possible
interpretations
under
such
circumstances
the
commission's
interpretation
is
much
more
in
accord
with
the
structure
and
intent
of
the
act
than
the
court
of
appeals.
let
me
interrupt
myself
and
answer
your
question,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
you
were
wondering
why
people
would
buy
high-priced
gas,
and
the
answer
is
a
contractual
one.
these
contracts
not
only
provide
for
pricing,
but
they
also
provide
for
take
or
pay.
in
other
words,
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
have...
to
be
a
producer
with
a
high
priced
contract,
you
also
have
with
that
contract
an
obligation
for
the
customer
to
take
85
percent,
90
percent,
some
cases
even
100
percent
of
the
maximum
deliverability.
so
while
given
their
choice
obviously
pipelines
would
take
the
lower
cost
gas,
they
are
not
given
their
choice
in
all
too
many
cases,
and
that's
the
point
on
high
priced
gas
versus
low
priced
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
take
or
pay
provisions
are
part
of
the--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--they
are
not
unfair.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
whatever
a
contract
is.
i
would
say
they
are
more
life
of
lease
contracts
than
20-year
contracts
nowadays.
i
am
saying
the
take
or
pay
is
part
of
the
underlying
of
what
happens
that
answers
the
chief
judge's
question
of
why
people
take
high
priced
gas
and
therefore
why
it's
important
to
get
this
case
resolved
properly
so
that
this
artificial--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--we
argue
it
is
unjust
and
unreasonable,
but
that's
a
different
issue
that
has
come
up
in
a
different
court.
it
is
not
illegal
unless
it's
declared
illegal.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
would
perhaps
want
to
have
take
or
pay
contracts
reduced,
and
we
are
so
arguing
to
the
commission,
and
this
was
the
issue
in
a
case
before
the
court
of
appeals,
but
that's
not
what
i'm
discussing
here
today.
justice
stevens,
we
do
rely
on
section
121
as
well
as
101(b)(5),
which
we
think
are
consistent
with
one
another.
we
do
think,
and
the
commission
said
this,
too.
it's
not
just
something
we
are
dreaming
up.
we
do
think
that
section
121
of
the
act
in
and
of
itself
makes
clear
that
what
is
involved
in
the
deregulation
process
is
the
removal
of
all
price
controls
from
the
specific
types
of
gas
which
are
deregulated.
certainly
that's
what
congress
thought
that
language
meant,
because
if
you
look
at
the
conference
agreement
explaining
what
121
of
the
act
means,
what
they
say,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
92
of
the
conference
agreement,
they
say
the
conference
agreement
provides
for
the
elimination
of
federal
price
controls
for
certain
categories
of
natural
gas.
thus
the
agreement...
that's
the
statute...
deregulates
those
categories
for
ceiling
price
purposes.
in
other
words,
as
we
believe
and
have
argued,
the
language
of
121
also
makes
clear
what
was
being
deregulated
were
categories
of
gas,
and
what
that
deregulation
did
was
to
make
inapplicable
the
price
control
provisions
of
title
1,
and
that
is,
of
course,
the
ceiling
price.
so
we
believe
that
the
commission
was
clearly
correct
in
its
interpretation
of
section
121
and
that
that
is
an
additional
reason
supporting
the
commission's
interpretation
of
101(b)(5).
they
are
consistent,
and
they
are
both
at
least
as
good
a
construction
of
those
two
sections
as
the
decision
below.
now,
the
court
did
not
disagree
with
the
commission's
interpretation
of
121.
on
the
contrary,
it
said
it
was
a
rational
position,
but
then
said
it
was
overruled
by
their
construction
of
121...
i
mean,
101(b)(5).
now--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--whether
you
take
121
or
whether
you
take
101
(b)(5)?
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
they
are
consistent,
and
are
saying
in
different
ways...
one
is
in
the
language
of
the
deregulation
itself
and
the
other
is
a
rule
of
construction.
the
same
thing.
as
i
said,
the
court
position
is
entirely
based
on
the
fact
that
the
commission's
construction
of
101(b)(5)
can't
be
right,
and
the
reasons
the
court
of
appeals
judge
gave
for
her
views
are
set
out
essentially
on
page
16
of
the
joint
appendix,
16a
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
what
you
see
she
is
saying
there
is,
she
says
the
deregulated
price
is
theoretical,
and
while
it
could
be
higher,
there
are
all
sorts
of
provisions
for
raising
the
other
ceiling
prices,
and
therefore
maybe
they
could
be
higher
at
some
time.
but
the
answer
to
that
is
the
x
plus
one
rule.
whatever
price
a
ceiling
is
raised
to,
the
absence
of
a
ceiling
allows
you
to
set
a
price
one
cent
or
more
higher.
and
therefore
her
argument
as
to...
on
page
16
as
to
why
the
commission's
position
can't
be
right
is
in
our
view
clearly
wrong.
what
is
more,
she
talks
about
the
price
of
regulated
gas
could
be
higher
than
the
price
of
deregulated
gas.
that,
of
course,
is
true
under
the
contract,
and
that
is
what
this
whole
case
is
about,
but
while
the
price
of
regulated
gas
under
a
contract
can
be
higher
under
certain
circumstances
than
the
price
of
deregulated
gas
under
a
contract,
the
statute
says
that
the
applicable
provision
of
the
act,
either
this
regulated
price
or
a
nonregulated
price,
is
what
could
lead
to
the
higher
price,
and
the
commission
is
obviously
right
that
what
could
lead
to
the
higher
price
is
the
absence
of
regulation.
it
may
not
lead
to
a
higher
price.
what
this
case
is
all
about
is,
faced
with
this
statute,
a
number
of
producers
and
pipelines
agreed
to
contracts
which
said,
in
the
event
of
deregulation
the
price
shall
be
x,
usually
they
said,
immediately
on
deregulation
it
will
stay
the
same
as
it
was
but
it
shall
be
subject
to
bilateral
renegotiation.
the
thought
at
the
time,
the
producers
thought
at
the
time
that
bilateral
renegotiation
would
raise
the
price
above
what
it
was,
but
the
pipelines
insist
that
if
you
are
going
to
get
this
right,
make
it
bilateral
so
that
if
the
situation--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--thank
you.
