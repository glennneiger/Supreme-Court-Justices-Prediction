justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
the
first
issue
in
the
case
rather
than
the
one
you
just
addressed?
have
you
abandoned
reliance
on
section
121?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
you
have
not,
however,
as
respondent's
brief
asserts,
conceded
that
their
interpretation
is
correct?
justice
stevens
mr.
davidson--
justice
stevens
--let
me
ask
you
a
question.
i
suppose
the
contract
could
have
provided
that
if
107(c)(5)
gas
is
deregulated
the
parties
shall
continue
to
pay
the
price
that
was
in
effect
immediately
prior
to
deregulation.
they
could
have
agreed
to
do
that,
but
instead...
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stevens
yes,
if
they
thought
it
was
possible,
they
could
have
said,
we'll
continue
to
pay
the
same
price,
or
some
other
category.
but
i
guess
at
that
time
you
probably
didn't
want
to
do
that
because
you
assumed
at
the
time
that
upon
deregulation
the
price
would
go
way
up.
justice
stevens
so
you
would
have
wanted
to
have
the
deregulated
price.
justice
stevens
does
the
record
contain
an
example
of
the
text
of
the
contract
we're
talking
about?
justice
stevens
the
briefs
do.
well,
okay.
is
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
that
had
you
foreseen
the
present
market
conditions
and
had
you
even
anticipated
ferc's
ruling,
that
you
could
have
drafted
the
contract
in
order
to
get
the
result
you
wanted?
justice
stevens
mr.
davidson,
may
i
interrupt
you?
you
used
the
words
"contract
provisions".
you
do
that
in
your
brief
two
or
three
times.
the
statutory
word
"provision",
"the
provision
which
could
result
in
the
highest
price.
"
would
you
not
agree
with
me
that
the
word
"provision"
means
the
statutory
provision
which
could
result
in
the
higher
price?
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
if
it's
a
standoff,
you
lose.
i
mean,
you
are
the
one
that
has
to
establish
the
plain
meaning.
they
don't.
they
just
have
to
establish
a
meaning
that's
in
the
ballpark,
that
justifies
ferc
in
interpreting
it
that
way.
assuming
that
the
congressional
intent
can
also
not
be
determined
from
the
legislative
history,
but
we
believe
that
the
language,
the
interpretation
which
ferc
has
adopted
is
inconsistent
not
only
with
the
language,
but
also
with
the
materials
in
the
conference
report.
our
plain
meaning
argument
is
simply
stated.
the
plain
meaning
of
language
is
the
meaning
one
first
and
naturally
attaches
to
it
when
one
sees
it
or
hears
it.
as
the
unanimous
court
of
appeals
held,
the
plain
and
ordinary
meaning
of
the
relevant
language
of
section
101(b)(5)
that
if
any
natural
gas
qualifies
under
more
than
one
provision,
the
provision
which
could
result
in
the
highest
price
is,
the
producer
gets
the
highest
price.
moreover,
if
that
was
the
thought
that
one
wanted
to
convey,
this
is
how
you
would
write
it,
or
perhaps
something
very
close
to
it.
if
on
the
other
hand
the
thought
one
wanted
to
convey
was
that
if
gas
qualified
for
at
least
one
ngpa
category,
which
is
deregulated,
it
shall
be
deemed
deregulated,
this
probably
isn't
the
way
that
you'd
write
it.
and
that
in
a
nutshell
is
our
plain
meaning
argument.
now,
ferc
has
a
different
problem,
and
that
is
illustrated
no
better
than
on
page
2
of
its
opening
brief,
where
section
101(b)(5)
and
order
406
are
laid
out
right
next
to
each
other
for
easy
comparison.
the
fact
is
that
when
you
just
read
these
two
sentences,
the
interpretation
that
ferc
is
adopted
in
rule
406
just
doesn't
leap
out
at
you
in
the
statute.
indeed,
when
you
read
those
two
sentences,
they
just
seem
inconsistent,
and
for
that
reason
ferc's
plain
meaning
argument
is
different
in
character
than
respondent's,
and
oddly
enough,
for
an
argument
of
this
type,
it
keeps
changing.
ferc
has
suggested
at
least
three
plain
under-standings
of
this
statute
in
the
course
of
these
proceedings,
and
of
course
we
know
that
mr.
solomon
has
advanced
yet
another
one.
in
its
current
iteration,
ferc's
argument
about
the
language
of
section
101(b)(5)
goes
on
for
almost
seven
full
pages,
parses
through
that
one
sentence
in
great
detail,
several
individual
words
and
phrases
are
expanded
into
full
explanatory
paragraphs.
there
are
references
to
other
ngpa
provisions.
there
are
references
to
ferc's
view
of
the
overall
structure
and
approach
of
the
statute,
and
even
to
bits
of
legislative
history.
that
argument
gets
so
complex
and
involved
that
whatever
else
one
wants
to
say
about
it,
it
just
isn't
a
plain
meaning
argument.
the
natural
reading
of
this
statute
is
the
one
that
the
court
of
appeals
adopted.
moreover,
the
court
of
appeals'
pleading
of
the
statute
is
supported
by
the
conference
committee
materials.
first,
the
house
conferees
stated
when
discussing
section
101(b)(5)
in
their
explanation
statement
that
a
producer
was
entitled,
to
qualify
his
gas
in
whatever
ngpa
category
which
yielded
the
highest
price
to
him,
which
necessarily
requires
the
producer
to
go
back
to
his
contract
to
see
which
ngpa
category
accomplishes
that
result.
now,
there
is
no
logic
in
then
coming
along
later
and
telling
the
producer,
forget
about
the
relative
price
levels
in
your
actual
contract
that
you
looked
at
originally
because
what
you...
the
way
you
are
really
going
to
be
paid
is
according
to
the
abstract
notion
of
whether
or
not
the
ngpa
category
has
a
price
ceiling,
and
if
it
does,
which
price
ceiling
is
higher,
as
the
government
argues.
mr.
davidson,
if
we
think
that
the
language
in
the
statute
is
capable
of
being
read
as
the
government
would
have
us
read
it,
do
you
then
lose
because
of
the
difference
that
is
owed
to
the
agency
interpretation?
justice
stevens
you
disagree
with
the
government's
statement
that
ferc
could
have
achieved
this
by
simply
altering
its
regulations
to
say
you
can't
put
something
in
this
one
category
without
putting
it
in
the
other
ones?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
why
can
they
do
it
in
the
one
situation
and
not
in
the
other.
justice
stevens
i
see.
