chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
87-363,
federal
eenergy
regulatory
commission
versus
martin
exploration
management,
number
87-364,
public
service
commission
of
new
york
versus
martin
exploration
management
company.
mr.
taranto,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
taranto,
perhaps
i
am
naive,
but
if
some
of
this
gas
is
deregulated
and
some
isn't,
and
the
deregulated
price
is
lower,
who
buys,
the
stuff
at
the
higher
price?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
a
question
just
of
contract
interpretation
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
solomon.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
solomon,
mr.
solomon,
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
davidson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
davidson,
you
say
this
case
will
determine
whether
the
producers
will
receive
the
market
prices
they
bargained
for.
now,
ordinarily
in
a
contract
you
have
a
contract
price
that
may
not
necessarily
be
the
market
price
at
all.
chief
justice
rehnquist
they
were
the
market
prices
at
the
time
the
contract
was
negotiated?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
market
prices
will
necessarily
correspond
to
the
contract
prices
three
or
four
years
after
the
contract
was
executed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
also
means
if
you
have
a
contract
for
over
20
years
what
you
negotiate
as
a
market
price
in
the
beginning
of
that
contract
may
not
be
the
same
price
you
could
go
out
on
the
open
market
and
buy
four
years
into
the
execution
of
the
contract.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
davidson,
let
me
interrupt
you
a
minute.
how
did
this
case
get
into
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
occasion
for
ferc
entering
order
406?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
did...
order
406
was
a
regulatory
order?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out
is,
why
isn't
this
simply
a
contract
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
have
that
term
in
your
contract?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
can't
you
simply
sue
your
customer
in
court
for
the
price
you
think
is
warranted
under
the
contract?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
significance
of
that
to
your
contract?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
are
not
arguing
the
intent
the
parties
here.
you're
not
arguing
this
as
if
it
were
a
contract
case.
you
are
arguing
whether
the
ferc
regulation
is
reasonable.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
seems...
well.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
you
could
show
that
it
was
the
intent
of
both
parties
here
that
when
you
said
unregulated
gas,
for
example,
you
meant
unregulated
gas
as
you
understood
it,
and
regardless
of
anything
ferc
ever
did
about
it.
would
you
be
able
to
prevail
on
that
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
won't
be
saving
that
if
you
get
into
court
suing
on
the
contract.
you
will
be
taking
a
more
positive
point
of
view,
won't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
would
that
void
the
contract?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
davidson.
thank
you.
mr.
taranto,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
the
case
is
submitted.
