mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
unanimous
court
of
appeals
correctly
viewed
this
case
as
presenting
a
straightforward
issue
of
statutory
construction
resolvable
from
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
as
well
as
from
the
explanatory
materials
prepared
by
the
conference
committee.
but
before
i
talk
about
the
statutory
language
or
the
conference
materials,
i'd
like
to
first
briefly
deal
head
on
with
certain
other
arguments
that
the
petitioners
have
heavily
relied
upon
in
their
briefs,
and
which
were
again
referred
to
today
in
the
oral
argument.
suggestions
that
this
case
raises
some
spectre
of
some
anomalous
regulatory
burden
due
to
gas
switching
in
and
out
of
regulation
or
the
spectre
of
producers
receiving
above
market
prices
and
therefore
some
windfall
unanticipated
by
congress
are
not
only
tangential
to
the
real
legal
issue
in
this
case,
they
are
demonstrably
false.
this
case
will
determine
if
producers
receive
what
are
in
every
sense
market
prices
they
bargained
for
in
their
contracts
with
interstate
pipelines
and
relied
upon
in
exploring
and
drilling
for
certain
kinds
of
gas
for
which
congress
expressly
provided
special
incentive
ceiling
prices--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
--in
the
contracts
that
were
negotiated
here,
the
prices
that
were
arrived
at
in
the
contract
are
in
fact
market
prices.
they
were
prices
that
were
negotiated
between
two
knowledgeable
and
willing
participants
in
the
marketplace
with
equal
bargaining
power.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
it
does
not
mean
that
market
prices
negotiated
into
contracts
today
will
be
the
same
as
those
prices
negotiated
in
the
earlier
contracts.
that's
true.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
that's
absolutely
correct.
that
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
prices
negotiated
into
that
contract
are
by
any
definition
when
negotiated
actual
market
prices
and
they
are
continued
as
such.
as
ferc
itself
was
at
pains
to
point
out
in
note
3
of
its
reply
brief,
market
price
merely
means
the
price
a
particular
purchaser
can
obtain...
a
particular
producer
can
obtain
from
a
particular
purchaser
at
a
particular
moment,
and
there
could
conceivably
be
as
many
market
prices
as
there
are
producer-purchaser
transactions,
and
that
is
certainly
the
case
and
certainly
would
be
the
case
for
a
commodity
like
gas,
which
is
historically
priced
pursuant
to
such
long-term
contracts.
in
discussing
these
particular
issues,
let
me
start
with
the
undisputable
propositions
that
in
the
ngpa
congress
established
different
categories
of
gas
and
set
different
ceiling
prices
for
the
various
categories,
and
further,
that
against
that
regulatory
framework
producers
and
pipelines
then
negotiated
different
pricing
provisions
for
the
different
ngpa
categories,
one
example
of
which
mr.
taranto
gave
in
his
remarks.
for
example,
high
cost,
high
risk
section
107(c)(5)
gas
may
be
priced
according
to,
say,
paragraph
5(a)
of
the
contract,
whereas
general
new
102
gas
may
be
priced
according
to
section
5(b).
categorizing
gas
as
high
cost
and
risk
section
107
gas
means
only
that
the
parties
themselves
price
the
amount
of
that
gas
priced
during
the
prior
month
according
to
paragraph
5(a)
of
their
contract
rather
than
paragraph
5(b).
there
is
no
other
regulatory
consequence.
in
every
respect
relevant
to
this
case
the
ngpa
is
merely
a
price
ceiling
statute.
saying
that
gas
is
"regulated"
means
only
that
it
is
subject
to
a
ceiling
price.
it
involves
no
certificates
or
filings
or
hearings
or
administrative
proceedings.
so
the
fact
that
a
gas
is
regulated
or
deregulated
changes
from
one
such
category
to
another
involves
no
regulatory
burden
on
ferc
or
anybody
else.
it
means
only
that
the
parties
to
a
private
contract
themselves
refer
back
to
that
contract
to
determine
how
that
quantity
of
gas
should
be
priced
according
to
the
particular
contract
provision
that
they
have
agreed
upon.
the
whole
reason
for
section
101(b)(5)
being
in
the
statute
is
that
congress
knew
the
gas
could
be
qualified
in
more
than
one
such
category.
with
respect
to
the
particular
kinds
of
gas
which
are
really
at
issue
in
this
case,
high
cost,
high
risk,
section
107(c)(5)
gas,
and
low
production
section
108
stripper
wells,
gas
of
that
type
is
virtually
always,
if
not
always
at
least
qualifiable
in
one
of
the
more
generic
ngpa
categories.
it
is
either
old
or
new
gas,
offshore
or
onshore,
interstate
or
intrastate,
in
addition
to
having
those
special
attributes
which
also
make
it
qualifiable
for
section
107(c)(5)
or
section
108.
now,
despite
the
inevitably
of
such
dual
qualification
for
such
gas,
congress
provided
in
the
ngpa
that
high
cost
and
risk
section
107(c)(5)
gas
and
stripper
well
108
gas
were
entitled
to
higher
ceiling
prices,
thus
leaving
producers
free
to
try
to
negotiate
higher
prices
for
that
kind
of
gas
than
they
could
obtain
for
the
more
generic
kinds
of
gas
that
were
subject
to
lower
ngpa
ceilings.
now,
where
the
producers
were
successful,
such
as
in
the
case
of
my
client,
martin
exploration,
which
entered
into
a
long-term
contract
with
the
petitioner,
panhandle
eastern
pipeline,
the
price
it
negotiated
for
its
high
cost
and
risk
gas
is
higher
than
the
price
for
its
more
generic
kinds
of
gas,
but
then
it
was
always
intended
that
that
price
be
higher.
these
were
prices
negotiated
under
higher
ceilings
that
congress
expressly
labeled
as
incentive
prices,
designed
to
call
out
additional
gas
production
on
the
margin,
and
in
reliance
on
those
higher
prices
which
martin
negotiated
in
its
contract
with
panhandle,
it
went
out
and
drilled
and
explored
for
this
high
cost
and
risk
gas.
for
martin
to
now
receive
those
higher
incentive
prices
for
that
category
of
incentive
gas
is
in
no
manner
an
unanticipated
windfall,
a
producer
assistance
policy
outside
the
parameters
of
congressional
debate,
or
any
of
the
other
labels
that
the
petitioners
have
fashioned.
to
the
contrary,
such
higher
incentive
prices
were
expressly
intended
by
congress
in
the
ngpa
for
those
particular
kinds
of
gas.
now,
as
to
the
level
of
those
prices,
let's
start
with
the
ceiling
prices.
congress
itself
set
the
ceiling
price
for
section
108
stripper
well
gas
in
the
ngpa,
and
in
the
context
of
this
case
none
of
us
are
free
to
question
that
judgment.
as
for
high
cost
and
risk
section
107(c)(5)
gas,
ferc
sets
that
ceiling
price.
it
publishes
it
several
times
a
year,
and
upon
a
proper
record,
can
lower
that
ceiling
price
if
it
is
in
some
way
out
of
line
or
unjustified.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
by
filing
an
appeal
from
the
order
406
that
ferc
entered.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
by
occasion,
sir,
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
it
is
not
a
contract
case
in
the
sense
that
what
ferc
is
really
done
by
this
order
is
foreordained
the
result
in
all
of
the
contract
cases
that
could
arise.
in
other
words,
ultimately
the
parties
to
the
contract
themselves
have
to
look
at
their
contract
to
determine
what
happens
upon
deregulation
of
some
categories
of
gas.
what
ferc
order
406
really
does
is
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law
gas
which
is
categorized
in
the
section
107(c)(5)
or
108
category
must
be
deemed
to
be
deregulated.
indeed,
even
if--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
--the
term
in
the
martin
contract
essentially
is
different
from
the
one
that
mr.
taranto
gave
an
example
of.
in
our
contract,
there
is
a
fixed,
in
essence
a
fixed
price
established
for
deregulated
gas,
whereas
gas
that
is
properly
qualified
as
incentive
107(c)(5)
high
cost
and
risk
wells
or
low
production
stripper
wells
is
entitled
to
a
different
negotiated
price.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
because
ferc
has
entered
an
order
which
says
that
that
properly
qualified
107(c)(5)
and
108
gas
is
deemed
to
be
deregulated
102
or
103
gas.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
because
that
means
that
that
gas
automatically
then
qualifies
under
the
category
and
must
be
considered
to
be
gas
sold
under
a
category
which
is
deregulated
under
the
contract
and
thus
is
priced
according
to
contract
provisions
which
neither
party
ever
intended
to
be
applied
to
that
kind
of
special
gas.
it
foreordained
the
result.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
or
just
consistent
with
the
statute--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
--i
think
is
how
i
would
rephrase
it.
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
the
only
point
in
going
through
the
background
is,
there
have
been
an
awful
lot
of
arguments
that
we've
heard,
which
are
again
referred
to
here
in
the
oral
argument,
about
windfall
prices
and
so
forth,
and
really
this
just
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
the
producers
can
obtain
the
prices
they
negotiated
for
this
kind
of
gas
in
their
contracts.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
yes,
if
the
parties
had
assumed
that
section
107(b)(5)
gas
would
be
deregulated.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
no,
sir,
we--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
--no,
sir,
there
was
no
provision
placed
into
the
contract
for
what
you
should
do
if
section
107(c)(5)
gas
became
deregulated
because
section
107(c)(5)
gas
is
never
deregulated
under
the
statute.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
so
in
the
case
of
my
client,
martin
exploration,
which
drills--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
--i
suppose
that
if
congress
would
pass
an
amendment
amending
the
ngpa
in
a
way
that
provided
for
deregulation--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
--that
is
possible,
except
in
this
case
the
ngpa
has
not
been
amended.
section
107(c)(5)
gas
has
not
been
deregulated,
and
the
contract
provisions
which
were
negotiated
said
that
properly
qualified
107(c)(5)
wells
were
to
be
priced
according
to
a
particular
contract
paragraph,
and
the
parties
did
not
negotiate
or
even
envision
at
that
time
in
many
of
these
contracts
that
that
kind
of
gas
would
be
priced
according
to
an
entirely
different
contract
provision.
there
has
been
no
amendment
to
the
statute
to
change
that
situation,
so
that's
the
reason
in
the
case
of
these
special
categories
of
gas.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
the
record
doesn't
contain
an
example
of
any
particular
contract
provisions
that
i'm
aware
of,
although
both
of
the
petitioner's
briefs
contain
references
to
examples
of
the
kinds
of
contracts
which
exist.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
sort
of
the
monday
morning
quarterbacking,
i
suppose
you
can
draft
a
contract
to
cover
any
eventuality.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
question
about
that,
but
the
problem
is
that
we
did
negotiate
a
contract
under
an
existing
statute
that
has
not
been
changed,
and
in
the
case
of
martin
exploration,
for
example,
it's
qualified
its
gas
under
the
particular
category
that
it
thought
would
wind
up
giving
it
the
highest
price,
and
in
its
case
did
not
even
qualify
the
gas
in
any
other
category.
it
qualified
its
high
cost
and
risk
wells
pursuant
to
section
107(c)(5),
and
not
according
to
any
of
the
other
deregulated
categories.
what
ferc
order
406
says
is,
notwithstanding
that,
that
gas
must
be
considered
to
be
deregulated
section
102
or
103
gas,
and
since
it
automatically
is
deemed
to
be
such
deregulated
gas
it
falls
into
a
different
contract
provision.
that
is
the
type
of
thing
that
is
very
hard
to
envision,
and
i
suppose
we
could
do
that
now
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
but
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
all
the
possible
ways
in
which
the
law
could
be
changed,
and
given
retroactive
effect
in
previously
existing
contracts.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
well,
there
will
be
underlying
contract
issues
that
could
arise
later
on
after
this
ferc
order,
but
i
think
that
if
ferc's
order
is
effective,
which
says
that
as
a
matter
of
law
this
certain
kind
of
gas,
which
is
107(c)(5)
gas,
is
to
be
deemed
deregulated
102
or
103
gas.
under
the
wordings
of
the
contract
provisions,
i
am
not
sure
whether
that
helps
us.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
but
the
only
consequence
of
that,
sir,
would
be
to
avoid
the
contract,
and
that's
not
a
solution
for
any
producer.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
because
what
that
would
do
is
say
that
a
fundamental
premise
of
the
contract
was
now
gone,
that
certain
kinds
of
gas
were
no
longer
in
a
category
which
the
government
now
says
it
must
be
considered
to
be
in.
i
don't
believe
that
would
obligate
anybody
to
pay
a
different
price.
i
think
what
it
would
do
is
void
the
deal.
and
that's
not
really
a
remedy
for
the
producers.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
absolutely.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
absolutely.
there
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
renegotiation
going
on.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
remember
that
the
way
it
really
works
in
the
real
world
is
that
what
the
parties
do
is,
at
the
end
of
every
month
they
total
up
how
much
gas
was
purchased
the
prior
month,
and
they
look
at
their
contract
and
say,
okay,
what
do
you
have
to
pay
for
it?
now,
for
that
given
month
there
was
a
contract,
there
were
contract
provisions
that
were
in
effect,
and
the
parties
just
have
to
determine
what
the
appropriate
price
is
from
their
in
effect
contract
provisions.
we
don't
believe
that
congress
concerned
with
the
hypothetical
possibilities
of
what
could
be
true
in
the
future
under
different
market
conditions
or
under
different
contract
provisions,
for
that
matter,
in
the
case
of
your
example.
we
think
that
what
congress
said
was
that
when
you
had
gas
that
was
classified
in
more
than
one
category,
the
price
that
is
to
be
applied
is
the
price
that
the
parties
apply
as
a
matter
of
courage
in
their
contacts,
which
are
in
effect
for
a
given
time
period,
when
they
compute
what
the
price
for
that
gas
purchased
during
that
time
period
should
be.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
there
is
no
question
about
that.
that
does
refer
to
the
statutory
provision
which
places
an
ngpa
category
label
on
the
gas
which
the
parties
then
take
back
to
their
contract
for
the
purposes
of
determining
what
the
contract
price
will
be.
with
that
general
background,
i'd
like
to
address
what
we
do
believe
to
be
the
central
legal
issue
in
the
case,
which
is
just
that
order
406
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
section
101(b)(5)
of
the
statute
as
well
as
the
conference
committee
materials.
our
position
is
that
order
406
is
inconsistent
with
the
plain
meaning
of
section
101(b)(5).
i
recognize
that
ferc
also
argues
that
the
language
of
section
101(b)(5)
plainly
supports
their
position.
but
merely
because
a
party
utters
the
words
"plain
meaning"
doesn't
make
it
true.
a
plain
meaning
argument,
like
any
other,
is
fairly
subject
to
examination,
and
for
that
reason
i
think
it
is
helpful
to
compare
the
plain
meaning
arguments,
the
two
of
them
being
advanced
in
this
case.
on
the
one...
so--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
--first
of
all,
this
is
not
an
agency
deference
case
in
our
view
because
the
intent
of
congress
can
be
determined
not
only
from
the
language
but
also
in
addition
from
the
conference
materials,
one
of
which
example
i
just
gave
and
another
key
one
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment.
but
moreover,
it
is
not
an
agency...
the
government
doesn't
even
win
on
an
agency
deference
standard
because
it
is
not
a
permissible
reading
of
the
statute
and
does
not
satisfy
certain
purposes
of
congress
when
it
passed
the
ngpa.
for
example,
the
purposes
that
these
special
categories
of
incentive
priced
gas
were
entitled
to
incentive
prices
pursuant
to
sections
107(c)(5)
and
section
108.
similarly,
ferc's
order
has
the
practical
effect
of
depriving
the
producers
of
actual
contract
prices
they
negotiated
in
their
contracts,
and
that
is
certainly
inconsistent
with
at
least
the
spirit
of
section
101(b)(9),
which
says
that
nothing
in
the
ngpa's
maximum
lawful
price
provisions
or
a
ceiling
price
or
deregulation
should
operate
to
nullify
or
supersede
a
contract
price.
the
second
piece
of
the
legislative
history
which
we
think
is
key
is
the
conference
report
itself,
which
is
intended
to
be
the
definitive
explanatory
statement
of
the
ngpa,
and
was
probably
crafted
as
carefully
as
the
statute
itself.
page
83
of
the
conference
report
states
that
upon
deregulation,
wells
qualified
in
both
the
section
108
stripper
well
category
as
well
as
the
section
105
intrastate
category,
gas
from
those
kinds
of
wells
could
be
sold
under
the
regulated
provisions
or
section
108
rather
than
taking
deregulated
treatment
as
section
105
gas.
now,
ferc
has
tried
to
avoid
this
part
of
the
conference
report
by
arguing
that
it
was
addressed
to
a
particular
question
not
directly
involved
in
this
case,
and
in
its
reply
brief
by
trying
to
make
the
whole
thing
look
as
complicated
as
possible.
i
think
the
simplest
response
to
ferc's
argument
is
that
the
nature
and
complexity
of
the
question
addressed
on
page
83
of
the
conference
report
really
doesn't
matter
here.
whatever
the
question
was,
the
answer
that
the
conference
report
gave
says
clearly,
and
clearly
expresses
the
understanding
that
dually
qualified
108
and
105
gas
could
be
sold
as
regulated
108
stripper
gas
as
opposed
to
deregulated
intrastate
section
105
gas,
and
ferc's
order
does
exactly
the
opposite.
ferc's
order
mandates
that
gas
which
is
so
duly
qualified
must
be
sold
as
deregulated
section
105
gas
rather
than
as
regulated
section
108
gas.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
sir,
that
argument
does
not
apply
to
the
108
category.
their
particular
argument
in
that
regard
applies
to
their
effort
to
say
that
107(c)(5)
gas--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
--which
they
have
the
right
to
define
shall
be
deemed
102
gas.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
because
congress
defined
what
section
108
stripper
well
gas
was
in
the
statute
but
left
in
section
107(c)(5)
the
commission
the
authority
to
define--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
--what
section
107(c)(5)
gas
is,
so
there
is
a
distinct
difference
there.
on
that
precise
point,
i
think
it's
important
that
the
government
really
is
arguing
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
the
case
of
the
107(c)(5)
gas
because
they
have
the
right
to
redefine
that
gas.
the
fact
is,
they
have
not
done
that
and
have
no
proper
record
for
doing
that
as
they
themselves...
as
ferc
itself
conceded
in
order
459,
issued
not
just
four
months
ago.
in
that
order,
ferc
expressly
refused
to
rescind
or
modify
its
original
order
99,
which
defined
what
high
cost
and
risk
gas
was,
and
said
that
it
met
the
congressional
standard
for
being
produced
under
such
conditions
of
extraordinary
risks
or
costs
that
it
was
entitled
to
the
congressional
incentive
prices
that
congress
imagined...
envisioned
in
the
statute.
for
ferc
to
now
argue
in
light
of
that
order
that
it
has
in
effect
done
that
redefinition,
after
just
refusing
to
do
that
in
december,
and
the
reason
that
it
gave
in
december
was
that
it
did
not
even
at
that
point
have
a
proper
record
on
which
to
base
such
a
determination,
for
them
to
now
argue
that
it
is
in
effect
accomplishing
that
same
result
merely
highlights
the
improper
nature
of
and
lack
of
support
for
that
part
of
order
406.
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
refer
to
or
discuss
or
mention
the
effect
and
rationale
of
order
406,
what
they
really
are
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
producer,
like
my
client,
martin
exploration.
as
of
march
31st,
1984,
martin
had
drilled
and
properly
qualified
high
cost
and
risk
section
107
wells
and
had
done
so
in
reliance
upon
contract
prices
it
negotiated
with
pipelines.
