mr.
taranto,
would
you
explain
how
the
circularity
problem
arises
with
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation?
justice
scalia
they
wouldn't.
i
mean,
you'd
be
able
to...
i
don't
see
how
you
end
up
in
any
circularity.
it
may
be
a
strange
situation,
but
you
would
still
be
able
to
know
from
looking
at
the
contract
whether
the...
either...
if
it's
a
renegotiated
price
it
obviously
could
be
higher
than
the
ceiling
price,
and
if
it
is
a
fixed
price
in
absence
of
regulation
you
can
look
at
what
that
fixed
price
would
be.
it
seems
to
me
you
would
be
able
to
tell
from
looking
at
the
contract
whether
it
could
be
higher
or
not.
there
is
no
impossibility
as
there
is
in
some
circularity
problems
where
you
can't
get
off
the...
can't
get
off
the
merry-go-round.
you
can
get
off
here,
can't
you?
justice
scalia
you
tell
me,
on
the
second
issue,
the
one
thing
that
concerns
me
about
it
is,
there
does
seem
to
be
a
requirement...
well,
there
is
a
requirement
for
determination.
the
determination
has
to
be
made
by
the
state
authority,
not
by
ferc,
but
it
is
the
scheme
that
you
don't
get
a
determination
unless
you
apply
for
the
determination,
and
it
sort
of
gives
the
producer
the
option
to
pick
the
category
that
would
be
most
advantageous
for
that
producer.
doesn't
the
way
ferc
is
managing
this
deprive
the
producer
of
that
option?
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
you're
not
contending
that's
unfair.
i
mean,
that's
the
deal
they
cut,
right?
i'm
over
here.
i
say,
you
are
not
contending
that
that's
unfair?
justice
scalia
you
traded
that
for--
justice
scalia
--you
traded
that
for
the
guaranteed
deliverability
over;
what,
some
of
them
are
20-year
contracts,
aren't
they.
justice
scalia
but
there
is
nothing
unfair
about
it
now.
you
are
not
asserting
that.
justice
scalia
you
wouldn't
want
those
contracts,
that
form
of
contract
outlawed,
would
you?
justice
scalia
mr.
solomon,
does
it
make
any
difference
for
purposes
of
other
activities
under
the
act
which
of
those
interpretations...
suppose
we
come
out
your
way.
does
it
make
any
differences
for
purposes
of
other
provisions
in
the
act
which
of
those
two
theories
we
take?
justice
scalia
statutes
are
amended,
and
i
think
these
contracts
envision
that
statutes
are
amended,
and
when
some
of
them
refer
to
deregulation
of
gas,
they...
you
mean,
they
don't
include
deregulation
by
amendment
of
the
statute?
justice
scalia
i
am
rock
bottom
certain
that
that's
what
they
meant
and
that
that's
what
they
do
when
they
enter
into
these
contracts.
they
envision
that
the
law
can
be
changed,
and
the
price
that
they
establish
is
the
price
that
will
take
effect
if
and
when
the
law
is
changed.
justice
scalia
mr.
davidson,
could
i
ask
you
about
the
central
point
of
your
argument,
which...
you
diverge
from
ferc
in
that
you
want
to
interpret
101(b)(5)
more
concretely
than
they
do.
they
want
to
decide
the
phrase,
the
provision
which
could
result
in
the
highest
price.
they
want
to
do
it
in
the
abstract.
obviously
unregulated
could
produce
a
higher
price
than
regulated.
you
want
to
do
it
more
concretely.
you
want
to
look
at
the
particular
contract.
but
if
you
are
going
to
get
more
concrete,
isn't
it
true
that
every
contract
is
amendable
by
agreement
of
the
parties,
so
even
if
you
look
at
it
in
a
concrete
fashion,
and
look
at
this
particular
contract
between
the
parties,
that
particular
contract
could
result
in
the
higher
price
because
the
parties
could
always
get
together
and
modify
the
price
provision,
and
indeed
a
lot
of
them
are
doing
it
these
days,
aren't
they--
justice
scalia
--in
view
of
the
whole
debaucle
that
has
occurred
because
of
the--
justice
scalia
--so
on
any
interpretation
i
don't
see
how
you
could
say,
whether
you
do
it
concretely
or
abstractly,
that
anything
but
the
deregulated
price
could
result
in
the
highest.
