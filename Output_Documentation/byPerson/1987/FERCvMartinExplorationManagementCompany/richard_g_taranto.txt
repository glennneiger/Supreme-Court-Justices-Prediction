mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
concerns
the
process
of
deregulation
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act
of
1978.
that
act
divides
natural
gas
into
a
number
of
categories.
those
categories
overlap.
some
of
the
categories
are
subject
to
price
ceilings.
some
are
now
deregulated.
producers
have
gone
to
the
agencies
that
handle
the
qualification
of
gas
for
sale
in
particular
categories,
and
have
obtained
qualifications
for
some
gas
in
both
the
regulated
and
deregulated
category.
the
principal
question
in
this
case
is
how
such
gas
should
be
treated
for
purposes
of
determining
the
price
at
which
it
may
lawfully
be
sold.
the
commission
concluded
that
such
so-called
dual
qualified
gas
should
be
treated
as
deregulated.
we
are
here
asking
this
court
to
uphold
the
commission's
view
of
the
statute,
and
to
uphold
a
second
commission
ruling
which
gave
rise
to
the
second
question
in
this
case
and
which
i
plan
to
discuss
at
the
end.
in
considering
how
this
case
arose
it
is
useful
to
have
in
mind
one
very
common
type
of
gas
sale
contract
that
producers
entered
into
in
the
mid
to
late
1970s
and
early
1980s.
those
contracts
were
for
long
terms,
20
years
or
more,
and
they
expressly
anticipated
the
coming
deregulation
in
1985
and
1987
of
the
most
important
of
the
categories
of
natural
gas
under
the
ngpa.
the
contracts
provided
that
until
deregulation
occurred
the
gas
would
be
sold
at
the
highest
applicable
ceiling
price
set
by
law
or
commission
order,
and
when
deregulation
occurred,
either
the
price
would
be
renegotiated
or
it
would
be
determined
by
reference
to
some
market
price.
to
ensure
the
highest
possible
ceiling
price
during
regulation
while
providing
in
advance
for
a
change
in
pricing
upon
deregulation,
producers
obtained
qualifications
for
particular
quantities
of
gas
in
several
different
categories
under
the
ngpa,
some
of
which
would
be
deregulated
in
a
few
years.
gas
at
the
time
was
in
very
short
supply.
market
prices
were
high,
and
it
looked
like
prices
were
going
to
continue
to
rise
into
the
indefinite
future.
producers
included
the
deregulation
clause
in
their
contracts
in
the
expectation
that
when
deregulation
occurred
they
would
obtain
higher
prices
under
those
clauses.
as
the
may
1985
deregulation
date
approached,
market
prices
had
dropped
drastically
and
were
now
well
below
ceiling
prices
in
some
of
the
alternative
categories
for
which
producers
have
qualified
their
gas.
many
producers
therefore
sought
to
escape
deregulation
clauses
in
their
contracts
by
trying
to
prevent
their
gas
from
becoming
deregulated
and
having
it
treated
under
one
of
the
still
regulated
categories
for
which
it
had
been
qualified.
the
commission
in
late
1984
proposed
and
issued
a
rule
that
rejected
this
effort.
the
rule
stated,
when
gas
has
been
qualified
in
the
deregulated
category,
it
must
be
treated
as
deregulated,
even
if
it
also
happened
to
be
qualified
for
a
still
regulated
category.
on
review,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
commission
had
misconstrued
the
ngpa.
it
declared
a
different
rule
for
how
to
treat
gas
that
falls
into
a
regulated-deregulated
overlap.
the
court
of
appeals
rule
says
look
at
individual
producers'
contract
prices
and
let
the
producers
choose
the
category
under
the
contracts
that
actually
results
in
the
highest
price.
this
means
that
two
producers
with
precisely
the
same
overlap
of
pricing
categories
can
be
subject
to
different
legal
treatment
depending
on
what
prices
they
happen
to
include
in
their
contracts.
what
is
more,
the
producers
can
make
the
change
of
status
daily.
depending
on
market
conditions,
they
can
move
the
gas
back
and
forth
between
regulated
and
deregulated
status
whenever
the
deregulated
price
exceeds
the
regulated
price.
we
think
the
commission's
view
is
much
the
better
reading
of
the
ngpa.
it
is
a
better
interpretation
of
the
relevant
statutory
language
and
more
in
accord
with
the
overall
ngpa
scheme
of
phased-in
deregulation.
first,
section
101(b)(5)
of
the
act,
which
addresses
the
general
question
of
how
to
treat
gas
that
is
qualified
in
two
categories,
says
that
if
more
than
one
of
the
ngpa
pricing
provisions
applies,
"the
provision
which
could
result
in
the
highest
price
shall
be
applicable.
"
that
language
does
not,
as
the
court
of
appeals
thought,
refer
to
particular
producers
or
to
their
contract
prices.
it
requires
a
determination
of
which
of
several
statutory
ceiling
prices
is
the
highest.
the
provision
with
the
highest
ceiling
price
is
the
one
that
"could
result"
in
the
highest
price,
and
of
course
if
one
provision
says
that
there
is
no
ceiling
price,
that
is
the
provision
that
could
result
in
the
highest
price,
and
so
the
gas
must
be
treated
under
that
provision,
that
is,
it
is
deregulated.
that
section
101(b)(5)
should
be
read
as
concerned
only
with
ceiling
prices
and
not
with
particular
contract
prices
is
also
supported
by
the
approach
taken
to
price
regulation
by
the
ngpa
as
a
whole.
the
ngpa
only
sets
ceilings,
and
in
fact
it
expressly
provides
that
the
act
is
concerned
with
producers'
contract
prices
only
to
the
extent
of
ensuring
that
they
are
below
any
statutory
ceiling.
in
addition,
the
contracts
like
the
ones
i
described
at
the
outset
show
that
it
is
the
law
that
was
meant
to
determine
when
gas
is
deregulated
under
produers'
contracts,
not
the
other
way
around.
it
is
not
the
contracts
that
determine
when
the
gas
is
deregulated
under
the
law.
one
clause
of
those
contracts
says,
if
the
gas
is
regulated,
a
specified
price,
often
the
legal
maximum,
will
apply.
another
clause
says,
if
the
gas
is
deregulated
the
price
is
determined
by
renegotiation
or
some
market
reference.
the
contracts
look
to
some
external
action
by
law
or
regulation
to
determine
which
of
those
clauses
applies.
in
fact,
there
would
be
a
serious
circularity
if
the
statute
required
reference
to
the
contracts,
which
then
required
reference
back
to
the
statute,
and
so
on.
the
court
of
appeals'
view
would
also
transform
the
statute
from
one
that
set
ceilings
to
one
that
established
price
floors.
ceiling
prices
set
for
a
regulated
category
could
always
be
charged
by
producers,
even
if
market
prices
were
lower.
that
turns
the
statute
upside
down.
there
is
not
the
slightest
indication
that
congress
believed
that
the
problem
with
the
market
was
that
deregulated
prices
were
too
low.
indeed,
the
very
nature
of
a
price
ceiling
is
that
it
is
intended
to
hold
prices
down.
that
view
is
confirmed
by
congress's
overall
plan
in
the
ngpa
for
phased-in
deregulation.
congress
did
not
intend
to
create
a
scheme
of
ever-increasing
producer
price
subsidies,
with
the
producers
always
having
the
option
to
select
a
higher
regulated
price
even
when
market
conditions
did
not
justify
such
a
price.
rather,
congress
intended
that
a
market
mechanism
with
all
of
its
natural
consequences
would
be
introduced
for
the
determination
of
prices
and
levels
of
production
of
the
designated
kinds
of
gas.
again,
the
ngpa
as
a
ceiling
price
statute
is
not
a
producer
subsidy
statute.
the
commission's
view
is
further
confirmed
by
evidence
that
congress
intended--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--the
answer
to
that
question
turns
on
when
the
contracts
were
made.
in
the
current
market,
gas
is
sufficiently
plentiful
that
new
contracts
are
indeed
being
written
so
that
purchasers
never
pay
more
than
the
deregulated
price.
what
is
principally
at
issue
in
this
case
is
a
whole
series
of
contracts
written
from
the
mid-seventies
until
the
early
eighties,
very
long-term
contracts
in
which
producers
and
purchasers
locked
themselves
into...
into
contracts
that
did
not
provide
for
a
maximum
deregulated
price,
so
the
purchasers
here
under
these
contracts
if
the
regulated
category
applies
would
be
stuck
at
that
regulated
ceiling.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
the
contracts
themselves
look
to
the
statutory
regulatory
interpretation
in
order
to
determine
which
clause
of
the
contracts
applies.
ultimately
the
price
that
a
producer
can
obtain
from
a
purchaser
does
turn
on
the
contract,
but
again,
those
contracts
look
back
to
the
regulatory
status
to
determine
which
clause
is
applicable.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
the
contracts
as
i
describe
as
written
say
in
one
clause
if
the
gas
is
regulated
then
a
certain
price
applies,
or
the
maximum
legal
price
applies.
if
the
gas
is
deregulated,
then
some
other
mechanism
for
determining
price
is
triggered,
either
reference
to
some
market
or
what
is
quite
common,
a
renegotiation.
those
contracts
are
written
on
the
assumption
that
some
external
action,
that
one
would
have
to
look
to
what
the
statute
says
or
what
the
commission
has
done
in
order
to
determine
which
of
the
contract
clauses
applies.
the
circularity
that
i
referred
to
would
arise
if
the
statute
itself
required
a
reference
to
the
particular
contracts
to
determine
which
of
the
clauses
applies,
and
the
clauses
of
the
contracts
themselves
then
required
a
reference
back
to
the
statute
to
determine
which
applied.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right,
i
think
one
can
get
off,
and
with
a
renegotiation
clause,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
typically
where
one
would
get
off
is
at
the
regulated
price,
because
the
producer
would
have
no
incentive
to
renegotiate
below
the
regulated
price.
my
reference
to
the
circularity
was
to
reflect
the
assumptions
of
all
the
contracting
parties
of
the
time
as
to
which
of
the
two
places,
the
contract
or
the
law,
would
determine
the
applicable
category.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
the
policy
here
is
to
allow
the
maximum
permissible
price
set
by
law
with
parties
free
to
negotiate
under
that
ceiling
according
to
their
bargaining
power
and
market
conditions.
that's
why
we
stress
so
much
the
words
"could
result
in
the
highest
price.
"
to
read
the
"could
result"
language
here
as
referring
to
the
highest
price
set
in
a
particular
producer's
contract
would
really
make
this
provision
an
anomaly
in
a
statute
that
otherwise
is
not
concerned
at
all
with
contract
prices
but
simply
says
you
may
charge
no
more
than
a
certain
level.
we
think
the
language
is
an
explicit
reference
to
a
ceiling
price.
congress,
as
i
had
suggested,
had
no
intent
to
allow
producers
to
opt
out
of
deregulation
and
return
gas
to
regulated
status.
when
market
conditions
did
not
prop
up
prices
to
the
level
set
in
the
statute
for
particular
categories.
congress
intended
a
one-way
transition
to
deregulation.
that
basic
design
of
the
statute
which
generally
deregulates
new
gas
indicates
that
congress
intended
market
forces
to
apply
to
an
ever-increasing
proportion
of
the
market
as
old
gas
was
generally
depleted
and
a
higher
and
higher
proportion
of
the
gas
available
in
the
market
became
new
gas.
and
finally,
the
possibility
that
deregulated
gas
would
come
back
under
regulation
is
one
that
congress
did
address
in
section
122
of
the
act,
and
it
provided
there
precisely
one
mechanism
for
a
return
of
regulated
status,
action
by
congress
or
the
president
one
time,
and
only
temporarily.
congress
did
not
envision
daily
returns
of
regulated
status...
to
regulate
status
at
producers'
option
into
the
indefinite
future.
finally,
let
me
say
a
word
about
the
second
question
in
this
case.
section
107(c)(5)
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
allows
the
commission
to
define
categories
of
gas
that
would
get
special
production
incentive
pricing.
the
commission
defined
a
category
called
new
type
formation
gas,
and
said
that
in
order
to
be
qualified
in
that
category
gas
must
first
be
determined
to
meet
the
qualifications
under
section
102
or
103.
that
definition
is
not
challenged.
what
is
challenged
is
the
commission's
subsequent
declaration
that
state
and
federal
agencies
when
they
granted
a
qualification
as
new
type
formation
gas
must
be
treated
as
simultaneously
having
granted
the
qualification
under
sections
102
or
103,
which
they
had
to
determine
to
be
applicable
in
order
to
grant
the
new
type
formation
status.
this
ruling,
which
means
deregulation
of
the
gas
is
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
commission's
power,
including
most
notably
its
power
of
definition
under
section
107(c)(5).
it
imposes
no
additional
burden
on
the
state
and
federal
agencies
that
handle
the
qualification
process.
it
merely
implements
the
unchallenged
definition,
and
it
sensibly
declares
that
the
special
production
incentive
pricing
should
not
be
available
for
a
category
of
gas
whose
production
levels
can
be
set
by
the
market.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
we
rely
on
section
121,
but
in
court
we
rely
on
it
as
additional
evidence
of
how
101(b)(5)
should
be
interpreted.
we
have
not
in
this
court
pressed
the
argument
that
101(b)(5)
is
inapplicable
and
121
by
itself
in
isolation
answers
the
question.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
we
haven't.
we
have
simply
omitted
one
of
the
arguments
we
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
from
our
petition
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
we
think
that
the
option
of
producer
choice
of
qualification
can't
be
stated
quite
so
broadly
as
the
court
of
appeals
did.
given
the
commission's
power,
several
powers,
including
its
power
to
define
section
107(c)(5)
gas
in
the
first
place,
it
could
have,
for
example,
here
simply
said,
gas
qualifies
as
new
type
formation
gas
if
it
meets
the
following
qualifications
but
not
if
it
also
falls
into
section
102
or
103.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
and
thereby
just
diminished
the
definition
so
as
to
exclude
precisely
the
cases
that
it
has
provided
for
deregulation
in
this
manner,
but
in
addition
the
commission
does
have
a
role
in
the
qualification
process.
it
has
given
general
regulatory
power.
it
has
given
the
power
to
establish
what
information
must
be
supplied
to
the
state
agencies
in
the
producer
filings,
and
it
is
given
a
review
process...
a
role
in
the
review
process.
we
think
the
commission's
general
regulatory
power
is
sufficient
given
its
role
in
the
review
process
to
require
this
departure
from
the
otherwise
general
rule
of
producer
selection
of
the
qualifications
that
they
apply
for
in
this
category
of
section
107(c)(5)
where
it
has
the
power
to
exclude
this
class
of
cases
from
the
definition
in
the
first
place.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
if
i
could
just
make
one
point,
the
problem
in
this
case
arises
solely
because
producers
contracted
to
renegotiate
upon
deregulation.
if
they
had
set
a
fixed
price
for
a
particular
quantity
of
gas
regardless
of
whether
it
was
regulated
or
deregulated,
then
this
case
would
not
have
arisen.
the
producers
here
have
argued
that
there
is
a
statutory
glitch
that
entitles
them
to
opt
out
of
those
deregulation
clauses
and
collect
higher
prices
under
the
regulatory
ceilings
our
position,
simply
stated,
is
that
there
is
no
glitch.
producers
must
live
by
the
deregulation
clauses
and
take
the
lower
prices.
thank
you.
