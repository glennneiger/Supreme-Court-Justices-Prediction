justice
kennedy
counsel,
you
have
really
already
addressed
the
argument
in
part
by
saying
that
you
think
there's
nothing
in
the
overall
scheme
of
the
act
that
indicates
congress
wanted
the
highest
price
at
ail
times,
but
that
means,
though,
that
the
last
clause
of
the
sentence
that
we're...
the
section
we
are
looking
at
is
a
little
bit
out
of
step
with
the
scheme
of
the
act,
doesn't
it,
because
it
does
say
the
provision
which
could
result
in
the
highest
price
shall
be
applicable,
and
when
one
first
looks
at
this
case,
it
looks
like
there's
a
policy
for
the
congress
to
allow
the
maximum
price.
