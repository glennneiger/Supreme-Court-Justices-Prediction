mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
absolute
position
taken
by
petitioner
is
that
he
has
an
unqualified
right
to
waive
any
conflicts
of
interest
arising
out
of
multiple
representation
stemming
from
the
sixth
amendment.
now,
we
acknowledge
at
the
outset
that
a
criminal
defendant
in
most
cases
has
a
right
to
choose
any
lawyer
he
wants,
but
that
right
does
not
stem
from
the
sixth
amendment,
and
it's
an
inherently
qualified
right.
it
is
not
like
the
right
to
counsel
or
the
right
to
self-representation
which
must
be
enforced
directly
by
the
court
in
every
serious
criminal
case.
now,
the
right
to
choose
your
counsel
is
inherently
subject
to
a
number
of
significant
qualifications
which
petitioner
ignores.
for
example,
the
lawyer
one
would
choose
may
be
unwilling
to
represent
you
or
his
fees
may
be
too
high
or
he
may
have
other
commitments
which
conflict
with
the
court's
schedule
and
make
him
unable
to
appear.
he
may
not
be
admitted
to
the
bar
of
the
court.
he
may
be
a
lay
man
or
a
disbarred
attorney.
all
these
sorts
of
reasons
can
limit
to
some
extent
the
defendant's
choice
of
counsel.
it
is
also
limited
by
the
existence
of
certain
serious
conflicts
of
interest.
these
conflicts
can
be
very
many
types.
for
example,
the
lawyer
he
wants
may
be
a
former
prosecutor
who,
while
he
was
working
for
the
government,
was
involved
in
the
same
criminal
matter
or
the
lawyer
may
have
been
retained
by
third
parties
with
interests
adverse
to
that
defendant
or
he
may
be
a
fact
witness
at
the
trial
or
implicated
in
the
same
criminal
conduct
with
which
the
defendant
is
charged.
courts
have
universally
held
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
conflicts
of
interest
override
the
defendant's
right
to
choose
his
counsel
and
permits
disqualification.
now,
the
most
common
of
these
types
of
conflicts
arises
in
cases
where
one
lawyer
represents
more
than
one
defendant
in
a
given
criminal
case,
and
rule
44(c)
was
designed
to
deal
with
that
situation.
states
that...
the
district
court
has
to
inquire
into
every
instance
of
multiple
representation,
and
take
such
actions
as
may
be
appropriate
unless
there's
good
cause
to
believe
that
no
conflicts
are
likely
to
develop
at
trial.
the
rule
44(c)
does
not
itself
state
what
actions,
what
measures
might
be
appropriate
if
conflicts
are
likely
to
arise,
but
the
advisory
committee
note
to
the
rule
makes
clear
that
disqualification
of
counsel
is
legitimate
option.
the
dangers
created
by
multiple
representation
that
rule
44(c)
is
designed
to
address
is
primarily
centered
around
the
fact
as
noted
during
the
previous
argument
that
the
interest
of
the
two
defendants
may
diverge
at
trial.
disparity
of
evidence
in
one...
between
the
defendants
may
require
the
lawyer
to
forego
presenting
a
witness
or
making
an
argument
or
taking
other
action
that
would
help
one
of
his
clients
at
the
expense
of
the
other.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
first
of
all,
from
the
record,
it's
not
actually
clear
whether
iredale
was
going
to
represent
him
by
himself
or
whether
he
was
just--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
it
raises
problems
because
he
was
representing
the
other
two
defendants
alone.
so,
no
other
counsel
would
be
protecting
their
interests
independently,
and
with
respect
to
his
representation
of
wheat,
it
would
have
involved
one
of
his
clients
being
a
principal...
not
a
principal
witness,
but
certainly
a
witness
with
adverse
information
to
the
petitioner
at
the
trial
and
it
was
also
particularly
troubling
about
this
case
is
the
fact
that
he
was
representing
defendants
at
widely
disparate
levels
of
what
was
a
fairly
large
conspiracy.
he
was
representing
the
lead
defendant,
who
is
the
ultimate
source
of
the
marijuana.
he
was
representing
a
middle
level
defendant,
petitioner,
who
was
responsible
for
brokering
large
amounts
of
marijuana,
and
one
of
the
small
fish
at
the
bottom
who
delivered
one
van
load.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
rule
44(c)
does
say
that
the
primary
burden
is
placed
on
the
lawyer
to
anticipate
conflicts
that
are
likely
to
develop,
but
there's
a
number
of
reasons
why
they
can't
do
that,
and
rule
44(c)
goes
on
to
state
that
even
the
defense
counsel
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
anticipate
all
the
sorts
of
conflicts
that
might
arise
at
trial
because
he's
not
going
to
know
fully
what
the
nature
of
the
government's
case
is.
also,
there's
the
problem
that
in
representing
more
than
one
defendant,
it's
difficult
to
give
independent
advice
to
each
defendant
if
the
multiple
representation
favors
one
at
the
expense
of
the
other.
now,
with
petitioner
having
a
separate
counsel
to
represent
him,
that
concern
would
be
alleviated
somewhat,
but
with
the
other
two
defendants
not
having
separate
counsel,
that
concern...
that's
a
very
legitimate
concern
of
the
district
court.
the
fact
that
the
motion
to
disqualify--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--iredale.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no.
it
would
have
been--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
he
would
have
been
representing
a
witness
against
petitioner.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
he
had
not
yet
been
sentenced.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
that
would
have
been
one
option.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
there
is,
but
the
concerns
here
are
really
twofold.
first,
there's
the
concern
as
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
noted
during
petitioner's
argument,
with
the
problem
of
adequate
waivers.
each
defendant
has
a
right
to
conflict-free
representation,
that
he
can
waive
only
if
he
understands
and
appreciates
all
the
dangers
involved.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
think
it
certainly...
it
could
be.
rule
44(c)
could
be
written
to
forbid
all
cases
of
multiple
representation.
it
would
serve
significant
interests
of
the
criminal
justice
system
in
the
finality
of
judgments
and
the
independent
interest
in
the
fairness
and
integrity
of
the
proceedings.
now,
it's
written,
it
doesn't
go
that
far.
it
takes
a
lesser
position
to
the
effect
that
the
trial
judge
must
have
some
discretion
to
override
waivers
in
certain
circumstances.
we're
not
suggesting
a
standard
in
which
all
cases
of
multiple
representation
would
lead
to
disqualification,
but
only
when
there's
a
substantial
likelihood
of
a
serious
conflict.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
substantial
likelihood
was
created
by,
first,
as
i
mentioned,
disparate
positions
of
the
defendants
in
a
criminal
conspiracy.
gomez-barajas
was
the
lead
defendant.
petitioner
was
a
lesser
defendant.
whenever
you
have
a
lead
defendant
and
the
lesser
defendant
represented
by
the
same
attorney
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
there's
always
a
danger
that
the
lead
defendant
will
exercise
too
much
influence
upon
the
decisions
of
the
lesser
defendant.
this
particularly
is
true
in
narcotics
cases--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
well,
decisions...
that's
correct.
decisions
that
the
lawyer
will
take
on
behalf
of
that
defendant.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
if
there
is
reason
to
think
that
there
is
a
hierarchial
relationship
between
them,
i
would
say
that
the
potential
for
conflict
is
sufficient
that
the
district
court
would
have
discretion
under
those
circumstances
to
disqualify
the
joint
representation.
i'd
like
to
explain
to
you
in
a
little
more
detail
the
nature
of
the
concerns
here.
even
if
the
district
court
goes
to
great
lengths
to
get
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver,
it
is
still
going
to
be
subject
to
collateral
attack
on
various
grounds.
the
defendant
can
easily
claim
that
he
did
not
foresee
the
actual
conflicts
that
would
develop
or
that
he
was
coerced
by
his
co-defendant
or
that
he
was
misled
by
incompetent
counsel,
and
there's
a
strong
interest
in
the
finality
of
the
judgments
in
preventing
such
collateral
attack
and
such
uncertainty.
there
is
also,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
an
independent
interest
in
the
fairness
and
the
integrity
of
the
proceedings.
even
if
the
defendant
is
fully
aware
of
the
dangers
of
multiple
representation,
he
might
accept
it
because
at
the
behest
of
a
more
powerful
defendant,
co-defendant,
or
in
order
to
help
a
more
culpable
friend
or
family
member.
now,
the--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i
think
not.
if
the
evidence
in
a
particular
case
is
roughly
equal
against
two
defendants,
if
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
coercive
relationship
between
them,
then
there
would
be
no
reason
that
the
district
court
could
not
allow
joint
representation
in
that
case,
even
though
it's
certainly
possible
that
conflicts
would
arise.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
he
could
allow
it.
he
could
allow
the
representation.
that's
correct.
but
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion,
if
he
does
disallow
the
representation,
it
can
rarely
be
reversed
because
there...
the
possibility
for
potentials
of
conflict
are
rife
in
any
joint
representation.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
first,
with
respect
to
bravo,
who
is
going
to
be
the
witness
at
trial
against
wheat,
iredale
would
have
received
confidential
information
in
the
course
of
representing
bravo.
when
bravo
took
the
witness
stand,
that
confidential
information
might
have
been
available
as
a
good
source
of
impeachment
of
bravo.
helpful
to
the
petitioner.
so,
he
has
a
choice.
he
either
helps
the
petitioner
by
burying
his
former
client
or
actually
his
current
client
because
the
client
hasn't
been
sentenced
yet
in
front
of
the
very
judge
who's
going
to
sentence
him,
or
else
he
holds
off
and
doesn't
cross
examine
vigorously
and
thereby
hurts
the
defendant
that
he's
currently
representing.
there's
also
the
difficulty--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--no,
they
did
not.
in
fact,--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i
don't
think
it's
conjectural
because
the
decision
has
to
be
made
in
advance
of
trial.
it
is
clear
that--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
he--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
judge
knew
what
the
witness
was
going
to
say
because
the
judge
had
taken
his
guilty
plea.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
bravo
did
provide
evidence
adverse
to
petitioner.
he
testified
as
to
two
overt
acts
in
the
indictment
and
he
corroborated
the
testimony
of
the
main
witness
against
petitioner.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
now,
i
was
going
to
say
there's
also
the
problem
of
the
appearance
of
impropriety
in
representing
both
the
witness
and
the
defendant
in
the
sense
that
the
testimony
of
one
can
be
curtailed
to
benefit
the
other
in
exchange
for
the
cross
examination
being
curtailed
to
represent
the
witness.
now,
for
example,
bravo
pleaded
guilty
to
criminal
conspiracy
and
acknowledged
that
he
had
participated
in
one
single
overt
act,
one
delivery
of
marijuana.
he
said
that
was
the
extent
of
my
involvement.
now,
if
his
involvement
is,
in
fact,
greater
than
that,
he's
involved
in
more
than
one
delivery
and
perhaps
a
delivery
with
petitioner,
then
what
could
be
more
convenient
than
having
the
same
counsel
representing
both,
not
cross
examining
bravo
about
other
acts,
and
thereby
not
bringing
out
any
connection
with
the
petitioner.
now,
i
recognize
that
there's
not--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--pardon?
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
think
there's
an
independent
interest
here
in
the
fairness
and
integrity
of
the
criminal
justice
system
which
would
not
be
served
by
allowing
such
an
appearance
of
impropriety.
there's
really
two
separate
interests
here.
the
interest
in
the
finality
of
judgments
and
the
interests
in
the
fairness
and
integrity
of
the
particular
proceedings.
now,
petitioner--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
gomez-barajas,
as
i
noted,
was
the
lead
defendant
in
the
case.
he
has
an
interest
certainly
in
not
being
called
as
a
witness
against
petitioner
or
otherwise
being
embarrassed
by
petitioner's
defense,
which
could
be
served
by
having
his
attorney
representing
petitioner.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
he
had
been
acquitted
on
the
main
marijuana
conspiracy
and
several
substantive
counts.
he
still
had
other
narcotics
counts
and
tax
charges
to
which
he
had
entered
a
guilty
plea,
and
he
was
awaiting
sentence.
there
had
been
a
negotiated
plea
agreement
and
the
district
court
had
indicated
that
he
would
be
able
to
withdraw
his
plea
if
the
judge
did
not
accept
the
sentencing
recommendation
that
had
been
made,
but
there
had
been
a
sentencing
recommendation
made
in
his
case.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
certainly
if
the
court--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--if
there
is
a
substantial
likelihood
of
a
serious
conflict
of
interest,
the
trial
judge
still
has
a
possibility
of
being
able
to
cure
that
short
of
a
waiver.
for
example,
through
a
severance
or
some
other
action.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
assuming
he
can
do
something
to
protect
against
conflict.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes.
there
could
be
circumstances
in
which
a
substantial
likelihood
of
a
conflict
was
not
presented.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
but
this
is
not
it.
however,
i
would
stress
that
our
principal
interest
in
the
standard
fashion
by
the
court
in
this
case,
rather
than
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
the
facts
could
be
strong.
but
the
important
point
that
we
want
to
stress
is
that
the
two
positions
adopted
by
petitioner
in
his
brief,
the
absolute
position
that
waiver
cures
everything,
is
unacceptable
and
contrary
to
the
views
of
the
established
disciplinary
standards
in
every
court
of
appeals.
the
other
standard
that
petitioner
puts
forward
in
his
brief
is
to
try
to
say
that
only
when
there
is
an
actual
conflict
of
interest
can
disqualification
be
permitted,
and
we
would
submit
that
that
standard
makes
no
sense
in
this
context
because
the
decision
has
to
be
made
prior
to
trial.
as
the
advisory
committee
notes,
you
can't
anticipate
all
the
problems
that
are
likely
to
develop
in
the
course
of
a
trial,
and
if
you
wait
for
them
to
develop,
then
it's
too
late.
you
have
invited
a
mistrial
in
the
case.
the
important
standard
that
we
would
suggest
is
that
the
judge,
trial
judge
finds
a
substantial
likelihood
of
a
serious
conflict
of
interest
and
he
does
have
discretion
to
disqualify
counsel.
the
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
even
if
petitioner
could
somehow
show
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
this
case
because
there
wasn't
a
serious
likelihood
of
conflict
of
interest,
he
still
has
failed
to
show
any
way
in
which
he
has
been
prejudiced
by
that
decision.
there's
been
no
challenge
here
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
or
the
fairness
of
the
trial
that
he
actually
received
or
the
competence
of
his
counsel.
now,
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel,
this
court
has
repeatedly
stressed,
is
recognized
not
for
its
own
sake,
but
for
the
ability
of
the
accused
to
get
a
fair
trial.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
pardon?
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
must
be
shown
because
of
this
court's
statements
in
strickland
and
cronic
as...
that
the
purpose
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
served
as
long
as
petitioner
received
a
fair
trial
at
which
he
received
the
assistance
of
competent
counsel
so
as
not
to
cast
any
doubt
on
the
reliability
of
the
verdict.
if
petitioner
is
completely
denied
counsel,
then
the
court
has
held
that
the
rule
of
automatic
reversal
is
appropriate,
but
in
a
case
where
petitioner
receives
the
assistance
of
counsel
and
there's
no
question
that
there's
a
reliability
of
verdict,
there's
no
reason
to
set
that
verdict
aside.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
one
would
prove
it
by
showing
that
the
trial
one
actually
had
was
unfair
within
the
meaning
of
strickland
because
the
performance
of
one's
counsel
fell
measurably
below
the
standards
of
the
profession
and
undermines
the
reliability
of
the
verdict.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
true,
but
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
trial
judge
would
not
conscientiously--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--but
in
this
respect,
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice
would
not
be
really
any
different
from,
for
example,
a
district
court's
decision
on
the
severance
motion
or
a
discovery
motion,
which
is
reviewable
only
in
the
context
of
general
review
of
a
fair
trial.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
