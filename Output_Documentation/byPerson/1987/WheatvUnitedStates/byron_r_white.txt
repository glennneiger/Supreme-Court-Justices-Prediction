justice
white
even
though
you
could
say
there
would
be
a
conflict?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
do
you
base
your
alleged
right
entirely
on
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
white
do
you
think
the
court
before...
before
the
court
grants
the
request
to
appoint
this
counsel,
can
demand
a
waiver?
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
say
counsel
of
choice
goes
to
the
court,
says
i
want
to
discharge
my
counsel
and
have
another.
justice
white
what
kind
of
limits?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
can
the
court
insist
on
a
waiver
of
what
appears
to
be
a
conflict
of
interest?
justice
white
well,
so,
he
could...
the
court
could
turn
it
down,
if
there's...
if
a
waiver
is
declined?
justice
white
i
take
it
then
on
your
position
that
if
one
of
these
persons
is
convicted
and
the
other
is
acquitted,
the
person
who
is
convicted
is
a
fellow
who
got
the
waiver,
that
he
is
stuck
with
it,
he
just
can
never
come
back
and
say,
look,
that
judge
shouldn't
have
allowed
this,
there
was
obvious
conflict,
i
was
denied
due
process.
justice
white
well,
at
least
you
would
certainly
have
to,
in
my
example,
you
certainly
then
have
to
at
least
relitigate
again
voluntariness,
whether
you
were
really
intelligent
and
whether
you
were
informed
of
all
the
circumstances,
and
whether
you
really
were
aware
of
the
seriousness
of
the
conflict
when
you
went
in.
justice
white
i
suppose...
would
he
also
waive
any
claim
of
ineffectiveness
by
the
counsel's
performance
during
trial?
i
thought
he
was
going
to
be
good,
but
it
turns
out
he
was
wholly
ineffective.
justice
white
well,
when
trial
counsel
fails
to
object
to
testimony
or
lets
some
in
because
it
favors
one
of
his
clients
but
not
the
other,
is
that
ineffectiveness?
justice
white
i
don't
know
how
you're
going
to
really
protect
the
court
system
from
two
or
three
more
trials
about
counsel
if
you
permit...
if
a
judge
is
just
foreclosed
from
turning
down
this
choice
where
there
are
conflicts.
justice
white
you
mean
the
lawyer
representing
the
lesser
defendant?
justice
white
i
think
your
substantial
likelihood
test
might
be
satisfied
in
the
case
in
the
sense
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
likelihood
of
the
conflict,
but
the
trial
judge
could,
nevertheless,
take
the
waiver.
justice
white
i
know
you
submit
the
trial
judge
would
have
discretion
not
to
take
the
waiver
in
that
circumstance.
may
he
take
the
waiver?
justice
white
well,
there
wasn't
going
to
be
any
question
of
a
severance
in
this
case?
justice
white
these
were
going
to
be
trials
on
end,
i
guess,
end
to
end.
the
possibility
that
he
could
take
the
waiver.
justice
white
and--
justice
white
--and
is
it
also
your
position
that
where
there
are
joint
trials,
two
people
at
the
same
trial
or
two
people
who
have
been
charged
in
the
same
charge
but
going
to
be
tried
one
after
another,
are
you
saying
that
there
are
circumstances
involving
those
facts
that
would
not
present
a
substantial
likelihood
of
conflict?
