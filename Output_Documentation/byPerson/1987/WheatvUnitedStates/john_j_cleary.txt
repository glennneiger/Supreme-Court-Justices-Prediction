mr.
john
j.
cleary
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
reason
the
petitioner
chose
mr.
iredale
as
his
attorney
in
this
case
was
best
stated
by
the
trial
judge,
who
said
"were
i
in
his
position,
i
would
want
mr.
iredale
representing
me,
too,
because
he
did
a
fantastic
job
in
the
prior
trial
and
i
can
fully
understand
why
he
wanted
him
as
his
attorney.
"
this
case
turns
on
the
question
of
right
to
counsel
of
choice.
i
would
suggest
that
it's
a
disqualification
issue
clear
and
simple.
the
issue
is
presented
where
all
parties
waived
any
potential
conflict,
and
the
question
decided
here
was
the
question
as
to
the
timing.
the
timing
in
this
case
was
that
the
attorney
following
basically
the
guidelines
of
cuyler
v.
sullivan
entered
the
case
at
the
time
he
could,
when
he
disposed
of
the
other
two.
when
the
second
guilty
plea
was
entered,
he
indicated
i
am
now
going...
i
am
retained
by
this
defendant
who
has
seen
my
superior
trial
skills
and
wants
me.
he
has
his
independent
attorney,
this
is
not
someone
else,
the
attorney
knows
of
the
performance
and
says
we
want
him.
the
trial
judge
says,
when
presented
initially
with
it,
if
the
clients
have
no
problem
and
the
prosecutor
has
no
problem,
i
see
no
problem.
at
this
time,
the
prosecutor
said
we
don't
plan
to
call
this
person
as
a
witness,
but
there
is
a
potential,
a
possibility.
no
time
previously
was
this
individual
considered
as
a
witness.
the
following
monday,
a
written
objection
is
filed
to
the
appearance
of
this
attorney
because
(1)
he
would
not
be
involved,
gomez-barajas
would
not
be
involved,
but
now
there's
other
person
who
wasn't
going
to
be
a
witness
will
now
be
a
witness.
that
witness
would
provide
no
adverse
information
against
the
petitioner.
that
witness
would
provide
adverse
information
and
substantiate
the
government's
principal
witness
that
he
was
a
large-scale
dope
dealer
because,
in
fact,
he
did
deliver
marijuana
to
this
individual's
home.
the
key
question
was,
did
that
marijuana
get
to
the
petitioner's
home.
the
answer
was
there
was
no
showing
in
the
record,
and
the
government
just
assumed
that
that
connection
was
sufficient
to
knock
out
counsel.
i
think
it's
also
important
to
note
in
this
case
is
the
district
court
finding,
and
these
things
are
so
critical
for,
i
think,
an
appellate
tribunal.
in
this
case,
the
court
said
based
on
the
representations
of
the
government,
so
there
was
no
factual
finding.
it
was
assumed
that
what
the
government
presented
in
its
written
papers
were
sufficient.
second,
i
have
no
choice
but
to
file...
find
irreconcilable
conflict,
not
a
discretionary,
a
balancing
of
the
issues.
there
was
no
hearing.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor,
they
were.
flat
out.
throughout
the
initial
hearing.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
right.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
factual
representation
was
contradicted,
first,
as
to
mr.
iredale
being...
i
mean,
mr.
wheat,
the
petitioner,
being
a
possible
witness
against
mr.
gomez-barajas,
if
his
deal
fell
through.
the
arrangement
as
to
the
non-marijuana
charges.
that
is
to
say,
the
other
charges
and
the
government's
representation
was
that,
gee
whiz,
if
that
fell
apart,
mr.
wheat
might
be
a
possible
witness
against
mr.
gomez-barajas,
and
on
that
record,
we
have
flatly
contradicted
by
the
assertions
of
mr.
iredale
that
there
is
no
way
he
could
be
a
witness
in
that
transaction.
so,
we
do
have
a
classic
confrontation.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no.
in
that
case,
your
honor,
there
was
an
assertion
by
the
prosecutor
that
he
thought
there
might
be
a
possibility.
however,
in
his
written
statement
of
which
the
judge
based
the
decision
on,
he
stated
only
as
to
the
deal.
i
think
both
sides
acknowledged
that
gomez-barajas
would
not
be
a
witness.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
the
government
didn't
say
he
was
going
to
be
called
as
a
witness.
the
government
said
that
the
reason
that
gomez-barajas
was
going
to
be
involved
was
if
the
plea
fell
apart,
then
the
petitioner
might
be
a
possible
government
witness
against
gomez-barajas.
the
government,
in
its
representation
to
the
court,
did
not
even
suggest
that
mr.
gomez-barajas
would
be
a
witness
for
them
or
the
defense.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that's...
maybe
there's...
there's
two
individuals.
gomez-barajas
and
bravo.
bravo
was
a
witness
in
the
trial.
there's
no
question
as
to
that.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
i
think
in
the
sequence
in
this
case,
sticking
to
the
record
that
we
have
on
the
22nd
of
august,
the
statement
of
the...
at
the
first
time
bravo
entered
a
plea
and
indicating
that
now
mr.
iredale
is
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner,
the
government
says,
at
this
time,
we
have
no
plans
to
call
him.
they
already
made
the
adjudication.
they
have
the
trial
the
following
week.
there
is
the
possibility.
so,
i
think
at
this
time,
what
we
have
so
close
to
the
trial
after
the
plea
is
entered
an
indication
that
he
is
not
a
viable
true-to-form
and
anticipated
witness.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes.
no.
i
think
the
defense
said,
yes,
he
is
going
to
be
calling
him
as
a
witness.
what
was
the
contradiction
was
as
to
whether
or
not
that
witness
would
give
evidence
that
would,
in
effect,
be
adverse
towards
the
petitioner.
and
i
think
that
the
concern
was
that
what
the
witness
had
to
say
and
in
the
case
we
had...
and
what's
important,
i
think,
is
the
time
sequence
on
this.
the
original
case,
mr.
iredale
represented
gomez-barajas.
in
april
of
1985,
some
several
months
before,
appointed
counsel
represented
the
witness
bravo.
bravo
relieved
the
appointed
counsel
and
at
that
time,
mr.
iredale
was
representing
two
defendants
with
the
approval
of
the
court
and
no
objection
from
the
government.
and
i
think
then
to
see
the
sequence
of
events
where
they
have
no
objection
to
multiple
representation
as
such,
to
shift
after
iredale
has
successfully
engaged
them
and
really
done
damage
to
their
witnesses,
the
same
witnesses
the
petitioner
would
be
facing,
changed
the
ball
park.
i
think,
further,
that
what
the
court
also
said
after
it
found
an
irrebuttable
presumption
of
conflict,
it
said
no
waiver
is
possible.
it
didn't
say
a
question
about
an
intelligent
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver,
which
i
think
is
an
appropriate
inquiry
for
a
court,
but
said
no
waiver
is
possible.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
what
happened
was,
your
honor,
that
at
first,
the
previous
thursday
is
when
bravo,
the
witness,
entered
the
plea,
and
the
court
indicated
it
had
no
objection
and
at
that
time,
the
representations
were
made
that
all
parties
involved
had
consent
and
the
court
said,
but
i
will
give
the
government
an
opportunity
to
object
if
it
wishes
to
object,
and
what
had
happened
is
the
government
filed
the
written
paper,
the
memoranda,
on
the
following
monday.
the
trial
is
scheduled
for
tuesday,
and
at
that
time,
on
monday,
given
the
government's
objections,
the
court
never
inquired
as
to
a
hearing
and
the
offer
was
made
and
there
was
a
clear
cut
offer
of
proof,
that
these
individuals
would
testify
that
they
(1)
had
no
conflict
and
that
they
were
willing
to
waive
any
type
of
conflict,
potential
or
actual.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
that
they
asked
for
the
question
of
taking
a
waiver,
but
i
think
the
judge
foreclosed
it
by
saying
waivers
are
not
possible.
so,
the
inquiry
of
what
could
be
said
as
to
the
nature
of
the
conflicts
or
their
intelligent
waiver
was
never
considered
below.
i
think
that
in
this
case,
the
representation
as
to
conflict
are
minimal.
i
think
that
the
concern
is
we
have
like
a
double
standard.
in
cuyler,
this
court
found
where
we
had
two
attorneys
representing
three
defendants,
and
the
first
one
went
first
to
trial
and
was
convicted
of
murder.
the
attorney
still
representing
the
other
two
and
found
that
there
was
multiple
representations.
the
court
held
that
multiple
representation
doesn't
work
to
the
disadvantage,
that
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice
is
that
it's
a
benefit.
you
should
have
the
ability
to
choose
who
your
attorney
might
be.
in
that
opinion,
there
was
at
least
some
concern
given
for
the
deference
that
was
owed
to
the
choice
of
the
client
and
the
attorneys
involved.
in
cuyler,
we
had
a
situation
where
there
was
a
potential
conflict
and
this
court
found
an
implicit
waiver.
in
this
case,
we
suggest
that
what
we
have
at
most
is
a
speculative
or
potential
conflict
and
should
it
not
be
able
to
be
overcome
by
an
expressed
waiver,--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
am
suggesting
that
a
knowing
intelligent
and
voluntary
waiver,
i
mean
one
fully
explored
by
the
court,--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--yes.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
can
give
an
example.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
famous
loeb
leopold
case
was
two
university
of
chicago
law
students
who
murdered
a
young
boy,
and
they
both
made
accusations,
one
accusing
the
other.
they
picked
a
single
attorney,
clarence
darrow,
to
represent
them,
and
could
the
prosecutor
come
in
and
move
to
disqualify
like
here,
on
the
grounds
that
there
would
be
a
conflict
of
interest
between
the
two
or
should
not
the
two
be
allowed
to
make
the
choice
that
may
be
notwithstanding
the
conflict,
their
best
interests
might
be
served
by
a
state
escaping
the
scaffold,
and
i
think
that
in
that
context,
we
could
have
an
actual
conflict
that
can
be
waived.
in
the
context
of
this
case
before
the
court
now,
my
suggestion
is
there's
only
two
potential
conflicts.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
standards
the
court
refers
to
is
that
they
lean
towards,
and
i
would
say
as
a
general
rule,
the
preference
is
to
have
separate
counsel,
and
to
that
extent,
where
i
track
the
other
lawyers.
however,
each
one
of
those
professional
rules
gives
way
and
defers
to
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
choose,
and
i
think
that
we
have
to
protect
that
right.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
even
in
the
face
of
a
known
conflict.
would
i
be
in
a
better
position
to
choose
my
attorney
or
have
the
government
choose
the
attorney
for
me?
and
i
think
given
that
tension,
i
would
like
to
think
i
could
choose
my
own
attorney.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor
is
correct.
i
think
there's...
the
court,
i
think,
in
chandler
v.
fretag
referred
to
it
as
an
unqualified
right.
however,
i
think
the
right
to
demand
counsel
and,
therefore,
would
have
to
be
a
lawyer.
second,--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
would
have
to
stick
to
the
terms
of
the
constitution
which
said
counsel,
and
i
think
that
the
meaning
and
understanding
of
counsel
at
the
time
it
was
adopted
in
1791
would
mean
a
lawyer,
and
also
at
that
time
would
mean
also
the
right
to
choose
a
lawyer
because
this
court
really
didn't
evolve
the
alternative
appointed
counsel
until
powell
v.
alabama.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
that
the
public's
interest
has
to
be
balanced
against
those
on
trial.
i
think
if
there
was
a
problem
as
to,
and
this
gets
into
the
issue
of
was
it
an
intelligent
waiver,
a
knowing
waiver
or
a
voluntary
waiver,
i
think
the
court
can
interject
itself,
and
there
are
decisions,
for
example,
when
the
individual
might
be
an
attorney
that's
involved
and
wants
to
represent
both
people.
i
think
there
are
some
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
that
would
be
voluntary
by
virtue
of
the
relationship.
my
suggestion
is
that
the
public
would
be
more
scornful,
that
if
prosecutors
could
come
in
and
move
to
disqualify
the
best
qualified
defense
lawyers
and
think
that
the
person
has
to
take
someone
other
than
the
person's
choice
of
counsel,
when,
in
our
system,
we
face
in
a
criminal
context
the
government.
and
you
have
to
think
that
the
person
who
is
with
you
is
your
advocate,
your
soldier,
your
protector.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
as
developed
by
this
court,
and
i
think
it's
rather
clear
cut
and
i
think,
if
anything,
i'm
here
with
the
pristine
pure
right
to
counsel
because
i
have
1791.
when
you
look
at
the
authorities,
what
you
had
was
only
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice.
in
powell
v.
alabama,
1932,
this
court
held
that
due
process
because
the
sixth
amendment
didn't
apply
to
the
states,
that
there
was
a
right
to
appointed
counsel
in
a
death
case,
but
alabama
already
had
it,
and
you
evaluated
it,
and
you
said
that
the
right
to
counsel
at
that
time
existed
only
by
statute.
'42
betts
v.
brady
didn't
find
it,
said
no,
doesn't
apply.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
would
suggest
that
the
argument
was
evolved
by
this
court
in
the
context
of
the
due
process
application
because
the
only
way
it
could
be
extended
to
the
states
would
be
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause.
so,
i
would
say
in
embryonic
form,
that
was
the
only
justification.
i
think
since
gideon,
it's
very
clear
that
the
sixth
amendment
inheres
in
the
right
to
counsel,
so
that
you
have
it
applied
to
the
states.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
would
say
that
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
comment
on
the
due
process
clause
under
the
fifth
as
was
applied
in
the
case
when
i
had
the
sixth,
which,
in
historic
traditional
concept,
gives
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
asserted
in
unreasonable
fashion.
i
think
it
has
to
be
a
reasonable
opportunity
and
limits
could
be
placed
on
it.
if
it's
a
dilatory--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--well,
i
can
only
use
the
rule
of
thumb
of
reasonable.
it
should
be
given
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
assert
it,
and
if
it
will
not
delay
the
trial.
in
this
particular
case,--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--if
the
court
makes
the
inquiry
in
a
federal
context
under
rule
44(c),
the
court
can
ask
if
there's
a
waiver.
i
don't
think
the
court
can
force
a
waiver
from
someone.
if
it
finds
there
is
no
waiver,
then
i
think
it
has
to
say
other
counsel
are
going
to
be
necessary.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
if
a
waiver...
if
there
is
not
an
intelligent
waiver,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
accept
it.
if
there's
joint
representation,
and--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--that
was
the
situation
in
cuyler
v.
sullivan,
where
the
one
who
was
convicted
and
two
were
acquitted,
and
the
question
was
this
court,
and
i
think
it
was
over
two
dissents
or
at
least
commentary
that
there
should
have
been
an
inquiry
by
the
court.
this
court
found
an
implicit
waiver,
and
in
this
context
where
we
have
an
expressed
waiver
by
all
the
parties,
and
this
is
not
government
witnesses,
this
is
not
the
government
like
we
have
former
federal
prosecutors,
and
the
question
is,
yes,
i
think
that
the
waiver.
this
court
would
have
to
sit
down
and
do
what
it's
doing
now,
to
go
through,
to
make
the
test,
is
it
speculative,
potential,
actual
conflict.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
an
inquiry,
and
it
wouldn't
have
to
take
very
long.
the
question
is
rule
11
usually
takes
ten
to
fifteen
minutes
as
the
court
knows.
in
this
type
of
case,
we
have
a
classic
example
in
krebs,
a
sixth
circuit
case
that
i
cited,
where
it
was
judge
peck
who
wrote
the
opinion
and
the
trial
judge
was
supersensitive.
do
you
want
other
counsel
appointed,
you
have
appointed
counsel
available,
and
he
did
it
in
a
matter
of
minutes
and
that
was
the
end
of
it,
and
in
that
case,
it
was
an
actual
conflict
because
the
prosecutor
intimated
that
the
attorney
representing
him
may
be
involved
in
the
criminal
misconduct,
and
i
think
in
that
context,
from
an
appellate
tribunal,
you
would
want
a
cleaner
sanitized
clear
cut
established
waiver
rather
than
the
speculation
about
what
constitutes
what
type
of
conflict
and
to
disqualify
attorneys.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice
is
different
than
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
i
think
one
is--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
think
that
the
court,
to
the
extent
that
it
would
ask
the
person,
do
you
want
to
fly
under
your
own
flag,
and
i
think
we
see
judges
do
this
all
the
time,
do
you
want
attorney
x
representing
you,
and
they
say
unequivocally
yes,
then
i
think
we
should
give
the
individual
that
choice,
and
i
think
an
effective--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
what
we're
trying
to
suggest
is
that
in
this
case,
the
judge
used
the
atom
bomb
to
disqualification.
there
were
other
procedures
in
this
case.
for
example,
mr.
iredale
not
to
examine
that
particular
witness,
and
there
were
also
other
alternatives,
cures
that
could
be
used
in
this
case,
other
than
total
disqualification.
we
didn't
have
it.
and
i
think
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
where
we
do
have
something
so
fundamental
as
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice,
and
we
see
that
and
i
would
say
it's
analogous
to
faretta
and
it's
not
to
be
measured
by
cronic
or
strickland,
which
is
the
lowest
minimum
level
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
think
we
all
have
to
assume
risks
that
are
made
in
waivers.
the
defendants
in
the
police
station
often
waive
counsel
thinking
it's
for
their
mythical
benefit,
and
find
out
that
they
have
to
live
with
that
mistake
much
later
on.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
first
of
all,
i
think
the
court
denigrates
the
role
of
defense
counsel
because
most
of
us
are
not
going
to
put
ourselves
in
that
situation,
and
in
cuyler,
there
was
a
representation
that
certain
deferences
were
going
to
be.
in
that
situation,
no
defense
counsel
would
take
himself
into
that
position,
but
there
can
be
cases
where--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--but
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
point
where
the
individual...
in
the
context
of
this
case,
we
have
the
government
using
it
as
a
tactical
advantage
to
knock
out
counsel
who
face
the
same
witnesses,
and
when
you
have
the
reason
to
want
this
particular
attorney
and
you
see
not
demanipulative,
not
be
stumbling,
not
be
mistaken
guidance
but
a
firm
choice,
even
though
it
has
with
it
certain
risks,
and
the
court
is
correct,
i
think
just
the
same
way
we
have
pleas
of
guilty,
can't
everybody
say
that
the
plea
of
guilty
is
wrong
and
that's
why
we
have
a
rule
11
hearing.
i
think
that
the
time
involved
in
the
context
of
this
case,
where
all
three
parties
waive,
it
was
a
speculative
conflict
that
in
this
particular
instance,
there
should
be,
i
think,
the
right
to
go
forward
with
your
chosen
advocate.
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
faretta,
i
think,
would
be
the
analogous
rather
than
cronic
v.
strickland,
for
determining
it.
this
court
made
reference
to
that
in
cronic
as
to
distinguishment,
lining
up
with
flanagan
in
every
circuit
that
has
treated
it
when
the
right
has
been
denied.
it
is
done
without
a
showing
of
prejudice.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
i
would
start
off
with
in
bravo's
case,
the
attorney
or
substitute
attorney
agreed
not
to
impeach
mr.
bravo
and
to
indicate
the,
i
think,
lucidity
and
accuracy
of
the
testimony
of
that
witness
on
behalf
of
the
government.
he
got
the
benefit
of
the
bargain.
he
was
promised
an
fyca
probation,
thirty
days
halfway
house.
he
testified,
all
right,
the
government
would
recommend
thirty
days,
go
away,
the
government
so
recommended.
so,
we
have
government
satisfaction
with
his
testimony.
as
to
gomez-barajas
being
the
source,
that
is
wrong.
the
facts
of
this
case
indicate
there
were
several
enumerated
sources
of
marijuana,
not
gomez-barajas,
and
the
reason
he
wasn't
was
there
was
a
prior
acquittal
and
vidal
was
still
shaking
in
his
boots
about
the
examination
that
he
might
have.
the
question
that
justice
stevens
raised
is
absolutely
true,
that
there
was
almost
on
the
knees
begging
that
this
super-star
defense
lawyer
be
joined
to
the
defense
team.
please,
let
me
have
mr.
iredale.
let
us
add
him
to
the
trial
team.
that's
1
rt
53-154.
however,
also,
there
was
two
points
for
two
of
the
witnesses,
vidal
and
one
of
the
other
witnesses,
and
the
defense
lawyer
again
says,
please,
please,
let
me
have
mr.
iredale
cross
examine
these
witnesses.
that
was
denied.
that
was
not
available.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
bravo,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
i
think--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
understand
the
court's
position
and
that
we're
getting
into
certain
imponderables,
except
that
in
this
case,
he
had
the
advantage
of
two
separate
defense
counsels.
not
only
for
mr.
wheat
but
also
the
co-defendant
and
neither
one
examined
bravo.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
the
only
one
would
be
as
to
bravo,
and
i
think
it
could
be
easily
sanitized
as
an
alternative
other
than
total
disqualification
to
say
that
he
cannot
examine
bravo,
and
in
the
context
of
this
case,
i
think
that
would
have
been
reasonable.
the
two
other
issues
that
i
find
every
interesting
is
the
washington
case,
the
former
federal
prosecutor,
came
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
in
that
case,
the
trial
judge
did
almost
like
here.
this
man
is
a
former
prosecutor.
he
may
have
had
confidential
information.
appearance
of
evil,
whap,
he's
off
the
case.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
remanded,
and
in
that
case,
the
former
federal
prosecutor,
we
had
different
clients.
the
client,
the
former
client
is
objecting,
and
the
court
held
in
that
case,
this
appearance
alone
won't
cut
it
because
you
have
to
honor
the
right
to
choice,
and
remanded
it
to
determine
if
there
was
confidential
information.
the
same
procedure
that
could
have
been
done
here.
diozzio
is,
i
think,
a
very
close
case,
where
the
government
has
negotiated
with
two
tax
lawyers.
they
were
willing
to
stipulate
and
at
the
time
of
trial,
the
government
says
we're
going
to
call
the
two
tax
lawyers
as
witnesses.
so,
they
knock
them
off
of
the
case,
and
they
offered
a
stipulation
as
to
what
they
would
be,
witnesses
in
the
case.
they
could
not
question
the
witness,
but
be
an
actual
witness.
and
the
first
circuit
reversed
because
of
the
tactical
manipulation
involved,
and
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
some
credence
given
to
the
right
to
choice.
the
last
thing
i
would
say
is
that
we
have
in
our
society
at
least
the
concept
of
an
ordered
liberty,
a
fundamental
right
of
choice,
the
right
to
go
with
the
one
you
want.
that
kind
of
oozed
out
of
faretta
and
i
think
that
rises
up
in
this
particular
case.
but
what's
very,
very
important
is
the
fact
that
we
can't
review
the
imponderables.
what
would
iredale
have
done
in
negotiations?
they
were
close
negotiations
in
this
case.
could
he
have
finalized
that?
what
would
iredale
have
done
on
vidal?
how
can
i
prove
those
things?
it's
impossible
for
me
and
should
i
suffer
the
detriment?
i
think
that
this
case
is
analogous
to
faretta,
and
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
a
showing
that
this
court
will
enforce
in
a
limited
context,
in
the
context
of
these
facts,
which
is
a
potential
speculative
conflict
where
all
parties
waived,
that
there
must
be
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
of
choice.
thank
you.
