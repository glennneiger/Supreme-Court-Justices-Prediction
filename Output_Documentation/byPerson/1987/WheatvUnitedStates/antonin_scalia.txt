justice
scalia
excuse
me.
were
any
of
the
government's
representations
contradicted
at
that
time?
justice
scalia
not
conclusions,
but
representations,
specifically
what
was
contradicted.
i'm
not
sure
that
means
that
the
district
judge
was
not
making
any
evaluation
of
his
own.
it
would
be
a
natural
way
to
say
it
based
on
the
government's
representations,
there
being
no
contradiction
of
those.
i
have
no
choice.
justice
scalia
what
factual
representation
was
contradicted?
justice
scalia
if
i
thought
we'd
have
to
live
with
it,
i
could
easily
accept
the
argument
you're
making
with
this,
but
i
cannot
imagine
that
you
really
think
that
these
people
are
going
to
live
with
the
waivers
they
make.
let's
assume
the
most
voluntary
informed
waiver
you
can
imagine,
this
counsel
is
going
to
represent
all
three
of
us
and
then
what
happens
at
trial
is
that
counsel
in
order
to
save
two
of
them
allows
in
testimony
or,
indeed,
elicits
testimony
that
absolutely
condemns
the
third.
counsel
said,
well,
i
did
the
best
i
could,
i,
after
all,
was
representing
all
three.
you
acknowledged
that
i
could
represent
all
three.
you
waived
it.
now,
are
we
really
going
to
allow
that
to
happen?
justice
scalia
we
have
no
problem
if
we
posit
that
no
defense
counsel
will
ever
put
himself
in
a
situation
of
a
bad
conflict.
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
any
of
this.
i
mean,
that's
the
problem
we're
talking
about.
justice
scalia
well,
i'm
sort
of
hung
up
on
justice
stevens'
point.
if
i
agree
with
that,
still
and
all,
in
this
case,
there
was
not
even
in
the
particular
trial
here
a
request
for
joint
representation
alone,
but
with
another
attorney.
could
you
spell
out
to
me
what
were
the
conflict
problems
with
the
other
defendants?
how
could
his
representation
of
the
other
two
alone
be
prejudiced
by
his
taking
on
joint
representation
of
wheat?
justice
scalia
what
about
the
other
witness?
what
about
the
other
one
that
he
was
representing?
justice
scalia
what
is
the
status
of
his
case
at
this
point?
justice
scalia
this
is
not
it.
justice
scalia
i
don't
see
what
his
agreement
not
to...
he
promises
that
he
won't
cross
examine
which
one
was
it?
justice
scalia
bravo.
that
doesn't
prove
anything
except
that
perhaps
he
was
being
induced
by
one
of
his
conflicts
not
to
do
something
that
maybe
he
should
have
done.
justice
scalia
i
mean,--
justice
scalia
--another
thing.
when
he
said,
could
i
be
added
to
the
defense
team,
what
does
that
mean?
was
it
clear
that
he
would
be
in
a
subordinate
position
to
someone
else
who
would
make
the
final
call?
if
he
was
on
the
defense
team
and
still
had
the
decisions
on
those
matters
that
were
matters
raising
his
conflict,
it
wouldn't
do
anything
of
any
assistance
to
simply
put
him
in
with
somebody
else.
