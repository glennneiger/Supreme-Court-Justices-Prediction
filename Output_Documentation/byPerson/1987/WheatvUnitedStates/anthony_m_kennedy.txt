justice
kennedy
mr.
cleary,
did
you
ask
for
a
hearing?
the
trial
is
on
tuesday
and
these
arguments
are
taking
place
on
monday.
did
you
ask
for
an
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
kennedy
am
i
correct
that
you
did
not
ask
for
an
evidentiary
hearing?
you
just
submitted
it
on
offers
of
proof?
justice
kennedy
what
was
that
substantial
likelihood
here?
justice
kennedy
well,
in
almost
every
criminal
trial,
there
is
one
dominant
and
one
secondary
character,
and,
so,
you
would
almost
say
that
there
is
an
absolute
rule
that
the
judge
is
never
required
to
accept
a
waiver
when
there
are
two
defendants,
one
of
whom
is
dominant.
justice
kennedy
well,
mr.
cleary
takes
the
position,
the
rather
clear
position
that
waiver
is
always
permitted,
and
that,
at
first
blush,
sounds
like
a
hard
rule.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
your
position
is
that
the
judge
can
always
decline
the
request
for
joint
counsel.
i
can't
imagine
an
instance
in,
say,
a
narcotic
trial,
conspiracy,
where
the
waivers
would
be
allowed.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
position
is
equally
clear
and
hard-lined
on
the
other
side.
justice
kennedy
well,
then,
you
get
a
new
trial
anyway.
