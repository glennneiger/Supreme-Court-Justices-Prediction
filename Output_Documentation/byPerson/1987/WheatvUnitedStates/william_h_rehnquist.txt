chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cleary,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
were
they
talking
about
the
prosecution
calling
him
as
a
witness
or
the
defense?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
that
somewhere
in
the
record?
so
that
we
know
that
the
district
court
credited
that
rather
than
the
government's
representation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
perhaps
i'm
just
not
getting
all
of
it,
but
in
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
you
say
the
government.
the
government
represented
that
someone
might
be
a
witness.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
when
the
government
is
speaking
before
the
trial,
all
they
can
do
is
represent
as
to
possibilities.
they
can't
say
in
fact
yes,
he
will
surely
be
called.
chief
justice
rehnquist
then,
the
government
changed
its
representation
shortly
after
that,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
are
you
saying
that
the
government's
second
representation
was
contradicted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
cleary,
you're
not
suggesting
that
in
a
voluntary
knowing
waiver
on
the
part
of
a
defendant
is
the
final
answer
to
any
conflict,
are
you?
that
that
ought
to
just
guarantee
the
selection
of
this
particular
lawyer?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
the
question
asked
you
can
be
answered
yes
or
no,
and
then
you
can
explain
your
answer.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
a
voluntary
knowing
intelligent
waiver
can
concludes
the
matter?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
how
about,
you
know,
the
aba
standards
on
conflicts,
state
bar
standards
on
conflicts?
you
know,
they
are
not
favored,
to
put
it
mildly.
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
in
the
face
of
a
known
conflict?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
can
carry
that
to...
you
can
say,
you
know,
my
real
favorite
is
someone
who
isn't
admitted
to
the
bar.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why?
i
mean,
on
your
theory,
if
i
think
someone
who
is
not
a
lawyer
is
better,
the
only
reason
we
demand
a
lawyer
is
to
protect
the
defendant
even
when
he
doesn't
want
to
protect
himself.
he
thinks
he
knows
better,
that
he'll
be
better
off
with
his
non-lawyer.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
cleary,
in
faretta,
we
have
seen
many
examples
since
faretta
of
relitigating
a
question
of
whether
the
court
was
justified
in
letting
them
proceed
on
their
own.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
trial
court
can't
win
in
some
of
these
situations.
if
he
says
no,
you're
not
capable
of
proceeding
on
your
own,
it's
appealed,
i
should
have
been
able
to
represent
myself.
if
he
says
yes,
you
are
capable
of
representing
yourself
as
you
want
to,
he
later
comes
in
and
says
if
i
had
any
sense,
i
never
would
have
tried
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cleary.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
kellogg.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
kellogg,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
position.
i
thought
it
was
that
the...
where
there's
a
conflict,
the
district
court
would
not
be
reversed
for
abusing
discretion
if
he
said
no,
but
that
he
in
exercise
of
his
discretion
could
allow
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kellogg.
mr.
cleary,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cleary.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
second
of
the
two
cases,
no.
87-4,
mark
erick
wheat
versus
united
states.
here
the
petitioner
and
numerous
co-defendants
were
charged
with
participating
in
an
elaborate
drug
distribution
conspiracy.
at
trial,
two
of
the
petitioner's
co-defendants
were
represented
by
an
attorney
named,
eugene
iredale.
shortly
before
his
--
his
trial
was
to
commence,
petitioner
asked
the
district
court
to
allow
the
substitution
of
iredale
as
his
counsel
as
well.
both
petitioner
and
his
co-defendants
were
willing
to
waive
the
right
to
conflict-free
counsel
but
the
district
court
denied
the
substitution
motion
on
the
basis
of
what
it
perceived
as
to
be
irreconcilable
and
unwaiveable
conflicts
of
interest
for
iredale.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
district
court
did
not
err
in
refusing
to
approve
petitioner's
proposed
substitution
of
counsel.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan

justice
stevens

opinion
