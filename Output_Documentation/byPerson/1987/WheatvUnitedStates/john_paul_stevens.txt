justice
stevens
mr.
kellogg,
let
me
throw
out
a
question
that
troubles
me
about
the
case
to
be
sure
you
don't
overlook
it.
you're
mainly
directing
your
remarks
to
the
case
in
which
the
new
counsel
would
be
the
sole
attorney
for
the
defendant,
and
i'm
particularly
concerned
in
this
case
about
the
fact
that
this
lawyer
was
willing
to
be
additional
counsel
and
he
could
have
kept
the
same
counsel
and
this
man
just
work
along
with
him.
why
wouldn't
there
be
adequate
protection
against
the
concerns
you
address
if
he
let
them
both
sit
at
counsel
table?
justice
stevens
he
originally
wanted
to
do
it
by
himself,
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
rather
clear
that
he
was
willing
to
serve
as
additional
counsel
and
just
cross
examine
these
witnesses
that
seemed
so
important
to
him,
and
i
hope
you
cover
that
point
as
fully
as
you
can
before
you
get
through
because
that's
what
troubles
me
about
this
case.
justice
stevens
but
i
don't
see
why
the
other
lawyer
wouldn't
be
perfectly
able
to
look
out
for
all
the
pitfalls
that
would
concern
the
court
in
that
situation.
if
you
assume
the
other
lawyer
is
completely
independent
and
competent,
which
i
gather
he
was
from
the
record,
he
would
surely,
it
would
seem
to
me,
understand
the
potential
for
conflict
and
surely
there
is
some
potential
for
conflict
here.
justice
stevens
clarify
one
thing
for
me.
during
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
man
that
wanted
to
come
in,
i
forget
his
name
now,--
justice
stevens
--iredale,
was
not
going
to
represent
another
defendant
during
that
same
trial,
was
he?
justice
stevens
if
the
trial
had
been
almost
terminated
and
a
plea
taken,
but
during
the
hearing
itself,
there
wasn't
any
possibility
of
conflict
of
that
kind.
justice
stevens
but
the
witness
would
have
been,
in
effect,
a
former
client.
justice
stevens
but
the
other
lawyer--
justice
stevens
--and
if
it
looked
like
it
was
really...
he
was
not
doing
an
effective
job,
why
couldn't
the
court
say,
well,
i
think
we
better
have
the
other
lawyer
examine
this
particular
witness.
justice
stevens
why
wouldn't
that
have
been
an
adequate
option?
because...
i
know
you
say
that
there's
no
absolute
right
to
counsel
of
your
choice,
but
surely
there
is
some
value
to
letting
a
defendant
have
choice
if
all
the
other
conditions
are
met,
that
he's
a
lawyer
and
that
he's
competent
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
there
is
some
value
the
court
should
respect,
is
there
not?
justice
stevens
now,
that
argument
would
support
a
rule
that
will
never
respect
a
waiver
because
it
may
have
litigation
about
it
later.
we
just
won't
allow
waivers.
i
mean,
you
can't
push
that
too
far.
there's
got
to
be
some
situations
in
which
a
defendant
can
waive
conflicts,
and
there's
always
a
risk,
you're
absolutely
right,
there's
always
a
risk
in
these
situations
in
post-conviction
proceedings
they'll
say
i
didn't
know
what
i
was
doing
just
as
you
have
in
faretta,
but
can
that
be
an
adequate
reason
for
never
accepting
a
waiver?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
before
you
leave
that
witness,
in
fact,
they
didn't
even
cross
examine
him,
did
they?
justice
stevens
so,
this
is
totally
conjectural.
justice
stevens
but
that's
my
point.
if
you've
got
both
lawyers
there,
why
couldn't
you
see
what
he
said?
then,
let
the
judge
say,
no,
no,
he's
been
talking
about
things
that
you
probably
have
confidential
knowledge
of
that
i
don't
think
you
should
cross
examine
as
the
lawyer.
why
couldn't
the
judge
wait
until
he
saw
what
the
witness
had
to
say,
and
he
would
have
found
out
there
was
no
reason
in
the
world
to
deny
this
man
the
lawyer
he
wants?
justice
stevens
based
on
that
particular
argument.
justice
stevens
then,
why
not...
then,
there
was
no
need
for
cross...
well,
i'm
sorry,
i
shouldn't--
justice
stevens
--and
the
petitioner
didn't
dispute
those
two
overt
acts?
those
are
the
deliveries
to
the
intermediary,
were
they
not?
justice
stevens
and
who
would
that
hurt
except
the
government?
justice
stevens
that
would
hurt
the
government,
not
bringing
that
out,
but
how
would
that
hurt
either
of
the
defendants?
justice
stevens
that
really
means
there's
no
remedy
whatsoever
for
violating
the
right
that's
asserted
here,
if
there
is
such
a
right,
because
if
you
require
that
standard,
you...
the
judge...
what
the
trial
judge
should
always
do
is
disqualify
counsel,
and
he...
as
long
as
he's
got
somebody
out
there
who
crosses
the
threshold
of
minimum
effectiveness,
he
cannot
commit
reversible
error.
justice
stevens
there's
a
lot
of
trial
judges
i
know
who
don't
like
to
be
reversed.
