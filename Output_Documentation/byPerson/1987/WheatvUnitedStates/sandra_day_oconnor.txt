justice
o'connor
mr.
cleary,
do
you
think
the
public
has
no
right
to
have
a
trial
proceeding
that
appears
in
all
respects
to
be
fair,
including
not
having
an
attorney
represent
two
defendants
if
there
is
an
apparent
conflict
of
interest?
justice
o'connor
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice,
if
it
exists
at
all,
is
not
found
in
the
sixth
amendment,
but
in
due
process.
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
the
government
says
that
entitles
you
to
adequate
legal
representation,
but
doesn't
extend
to
a
choice.
