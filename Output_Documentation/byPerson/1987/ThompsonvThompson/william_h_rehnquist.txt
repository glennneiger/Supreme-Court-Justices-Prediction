william
h.

we
will
hear
argument
now
on
no.
86-964,
david
a.
thompson
v.
susan
a.
thompson.
mr.
weiss,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
a
form
of
federal
question
jurisdiction
and
implied
cause
of
action?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
is
quite
consistent
with
the
ninth
circuit's
majority's
view
that
what
this
is...
the
pkpa
is
a
rule
of
decision
for
state
courts,
like
the
avla,
rather
than
creating
a
separate
cause
of
action
in
federal
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
think
that
is
entirely
true,
mr.
weiss.
take
the
example
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
suits
there
are
brought
under
that
act
in
the
state
courts,
but
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
this
court
reviewed
a
number
of
state
court
judgments
that
came
up
to
through
the
state
court
system,
laid
down
some
rules
as
to
what
the
flea
required.
and
the
state
courts
henceforth
followed
those
rules.
i
think
the
same
thing
could
happen
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
pkpa
is
an
act
of
congress.
is
the
uccja
also
an
act
of
congress?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
would
think
the
pkpa
would
prevail
then.
one
is
a
state
act
and
the
other
is
an
act
of
congress.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
is
what
congress
sought
to
change
in
the
pkpa;
is
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
here
congress...
as
i
understand
it,
congress
has
said
in
the
pkpa,
"even
though
you
don't
give
full
faith...
even
though
full
faith
and
credit
does
not
permit
you
to
recognize
a
custody
judgment
from
another
state
because
it
is
always
subject
to
modification,
we
now
tell
you
that
you
should.
"
is
that
a
misstatement
of
what
the
pkpa
says
wherever
it
is
to
be
enforced
in
federal
or
state
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
weiss.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
rigby.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rigby.
mr.
weiss,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
you
are
not
required
to
expend
them,
however.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-964,
thompson
against
thompson
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
