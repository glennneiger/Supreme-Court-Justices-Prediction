justice
o'connor
mr.
weiss,
in
your
application
here
and
your
presentation
of
the
question
to
us,
you
appear
to
have
raised
only
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
an
implied
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
your
client
under
this
federal
act.
right?
justice
o'connor
you
did
not
raise
below
or
raise
in
your
cert
petition,
i
gather,
that
there
is
federal
question
jurisdiction
in
any
event
quite
apart
from
any
implied
cause
of
action.
justice
o'connor
you
raised
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
federal
question
jurisdiction
quite
apart
from
an
implied
cause
of
action?
justice
o'connor
you
didn't
present
that
question
to
us
in
the
cert
petition;
did
you?
justice
o'connor
no.
justice
o'connor
and,
yet,
most
of
the
cases
below
dealing
with
this
question
have
gone
off
on
the
theory
of
federal
question
jurisdiction:
its
existence
or
the
lack
of
it.
justice
o'connor
did
the
courts
below
deal
with
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
legislative
history,
though,
is
really
pretty
clear,
isn't
it,
that
congress
directly
considered
this
and
recognized
the
problem
and
simply
decided
to
go
slowly
in
this
area
and
not
to
make
it
a
matter
of
federal
question
jurisdiction.
justice
o'connor
you
seldom
see
a
legislative
history
this
clear,
i
think.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
weiss,
maybe
we
just
need
a
test
case
from
louisiana,
but
i
think
for
you
to
make
the
assumption
that
no
state
court
is
going
to
apply
the
parental
kidnapping
act
properly
is
unwarranted.
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
why
this
court
sits:
to
resolve
conflicts
like
that.
justice
o'connor
all
right.
