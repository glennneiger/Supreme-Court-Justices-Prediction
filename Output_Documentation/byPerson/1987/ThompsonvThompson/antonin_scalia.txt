well,
not
ultimately.
as
the
chief
justice
said,
those
interpretations,
if
they
are
in
conflict',
can
be
resolved
by
the
supreme
court.
in
other
words,
there
is
an
intermediate
position
between
saying
it
is
advisory
on
the
one
hand.
and,
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
mandatory
and
enforceable
in
federal
courts.
that
is
it
is
mandatory,
but
enforceable
by
the
state
courts
with
review
of
erroneous
state
court
decisions
by
the
supreme
court.
why
doesn't
that
work?
justice
scalia
from
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
scalia
full
faith
credits
that
there
in
the
same
way.
justice
scalia
is
not
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute,
indeed
the
full
faith
and
credit
provision
of
the
constitution
which
says
that
each
state
shall
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
judicial
decrees
of
the
other
states.
and,
yet,
we
do
not
allow
for
enforcement
of
that
in
federal
courts.
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
this
discussion.
you
don't
have
a
federal
cause
of
action
just
because
you
have
a
federal
right.
justice
scalia
for
example,
it
is
a
federal
right
to
have
federal...
federal
law
supersedes
state
law.
federal
pre-emption.
correct?
justice
scalia
but
that
doesn't
give
me
a
cause
of
action
to
sue
for
federal
pre-emption.
my
suit
is
whatever,
whatever
the
state
cause
of
action
or
other
federal
cause
of
action
might
be:
for
custody
of
the
child,
for
torque,
for
contract
and
so
forth.
and
in
the
course
of
that
suit,
i
am
entitled
to
have
federal
pre-emption
rules
applied.
right?
justice
scalia
we
are
talking
about
here
whether
there
is
a
cause
of
action
to
have
the
pkpa
applied
or
rather
whether
that
is
just
a
rule
of
law
which
will
be
applied
in
other
suits:
custody
and
torque,
contract
or
whatever.
justice
scalia
so,
i
suppose
then
the
answer
would
be
to
this
person
that
if
you
wanted
to
prevent
the
issuance
of
this
louisiana
custody
decree
because
of
this
federal
statute,
you
should
have
gone
to
louisiana
and
a
time
and
defended
on
the
grounds
of
the
federal
statute.
justice
scalia
and
now,
it
is
too
late.
