could
we
get
it
to
the
federal

in
california?
justice

to

of

i
just
want
to
know
how
you
are
going
to
get
a
hold
in.
justice
marshall
the
only
thing
we

here
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal

justice

and
i
am
asking
you
how
can
the
federal
court
pick
him
up
in
louisiana
and
bring
him
to
california.
justice
marshall
well,
this
is
unbelievable
to
me.
i
guess
i
went
to
school
too
far
back.
i
mean
i
thought
jurisdiction
was
on
boundary
line.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
the
effect
that
the
parental
kidnapping
prevention
act
does
not
provide
an
implied
course
of
action
in
federal
courts
to
determine
which
of
the
two
conflicting
state
custody
decisions
is
valid.
we
concluded
that
the
context's
language
and
legislative
history
of
the
act
all
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
extend
full
faith
and
credit
requirements
to
the
custody
decree
rather
than
to
create
an
entirely
new
federal
course
of
action.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
and
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
