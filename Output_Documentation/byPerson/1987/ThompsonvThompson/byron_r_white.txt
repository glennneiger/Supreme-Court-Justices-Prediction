justice
white
all
that
means
is
that...
that
might
make
it
very
clear
that...
the
louisiana
court,
is
that
the
one?
justice
white
that
the
louisiana
court
made
a
mistake.
that
could
be
corrected
by
coming
up
through
the
state
system.
justice
white
wasn't
this
federal
suit
dismissed
for
want
of
personal
jurisdiction,
also?
justice
white
well,
how
were
you
going
to
proceed
in
california
to
get
jurisdiction
over
somebody
in
louisiana?
justice
white
again,
in
california?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
that
is
really
the
correct
way
of
putting
it?
isn't
it
whether
congress
intended
to
create
a
private
cause
of
action
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
do
you
agree
that
this
federal
act
would
be
enforceable
in
a
state
court?
justice
white
how
would
a
parent
who
claims
the
benefit
of
that
act
get
into
a
state
court
to
enforce
it
without
having...
without
being
able
to
say
that:
congress
intended
me
to
have
the
right
to
enforce
this
statute
in
a
state
court?
justice
white
but
a
parent
who
claim
is
a
benefit
of
the
act
would
have
to
be
able
to
get
into
court.
justice
white
and
be
able
to
say
the
federal
act
intends
me
to
have
the
right
to
enforce
this
in
a
state
court.
is
that
right?
justice
white
in
this
case,
there
has
been
a
louisiana
custody
order;
hasn't
there?
justice
white
and
if
this
parent
is
told
you
must
enforce
this
act
if
you
have
any
right
under
it
at
all
in
the
louisiana
court,
he's
going
to
have
to
go
down
there
and
assert
some
right
under
this
statute
to
get
that
custody
order
overturned.
justice
white
well,
how
will
he
enforce
it
now,
the
statute?
justice
white
so,
he
will
be
asserting
his
right
in
that
action.
justice
white
under
the
federal
statute.
