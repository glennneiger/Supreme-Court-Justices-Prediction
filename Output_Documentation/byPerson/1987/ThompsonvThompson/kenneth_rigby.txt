mr.
kenneth
rigby
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
basic
question
is
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
court
v.
ash,
touce
ross,
northwest
airlines,
merrill
lynch,
merrell
dow
cases.
what
was
the
intention
of
congress?
was
it
to
create
a
private
remedy?
now,
that
private
remedy
has
been
interpreted
and
diagnosed
in
different
terms
in
terms
of
federal
question
jurisdiction,
rogers
v.
platt,
the
court
of
appeals
circuit,
in
terms
of
a
private
cause
or
right
of
action
in
thompson
v.
thompson,
some
cases
call
it
a
cause
of
action.
some
call
it
a
right
of
action.
but
the
fundamental
threshold
question
is
whether
congress
intended
to
create
any
private
remedy,
whether
it
is
called
federal
question
jurisdiction
or
whether
it
is
called
a
private
cause
of
action.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
that
is
the
way
thompson,
the
ninth
circuit
interpreted.
the
court
of
appeals
circuit
in
rogers
v.
platt
interpreted
it
in
terms
of
whether
congress
intended
to
create
federal
question
jurisdiction.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
yes.
and
it
was
intended
to
be
enforceable
in
the
state
court.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
because
it
is
a
direction
to
the
appropriate
authorities
of
each
state:
shall
enforce
and
shall
not
modify.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
yes,
sir.
that's
correct,
sir.
but
it
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
congress
intended
to
create
a
federal
private
right
of
action,
not
just
a
right
of
action.
obviously,
congress
intended
to
create
a
right
of
action
and
somebody
to
enforce
its
provisions.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
that
may
very
well
be
a
correct
analysis.
when
you
compare
it
to
full
faith
and
credit,
itself,
because
this
is
an
addendum
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
no,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
right.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
i
would
agree
with
that
analysis.
i
was
not
espousing
these
analyses
by
the
courts,
but
in
addressing
justice
o'connor's
original
question
about
whether
it
is
a
jurisdictional
issue
or
a
cause
of
action
issue,
to
point
out
that
differing
federal
courts
have
analyzed
it
differently.
it
is
our
position
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
federal
courts
enforce
pkpa
except
through
seriary
to
this
court
after
the
exhaustion
of
state
of
remedies.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
that's
right.
defended
it--
mr.
kenneth
rigby
--no,
sir.
it's
not
too
late.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
dr.
thompson
can
bring
an
action
in
the
louisiana
court
based
upon
his
california
decree,
contend
that
the
louisiana
court
lacked
jurisdiction
under
pkpa
to
enter
its
decree,
which,
incidentally,
was
the--
mr.
kenneth
rigby
--that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
rigby
that's
correct.
and
congress
specifically
intended,
we
submit,
from
the
very
exhaustive
legislative
history,
that
pkpa,
that
the
onus
of
enforcement
of
pkpa
be
placed
on
the
state
courts,
not
the
federal
courts.
if
i
may,
very
briefly:
there
were
seven
factors
that
have
been
outlined
which
i
believe
all
members
of
this
court
agree
upon
in
one
way
or
the
other
with
respect
to
discerning
congressional
intent
in
this
issue.
and
that
is
congress'
perception
of
the
law
it
was
shaping
or
reshaping.
secondly,
the
problem
which
congress
perceived
that
was
not
being
adequately
addressed
by
that
law,
the
language
of
the
statute,
itself,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
the
likelihood
that
congress
intended
to
supercede
or
to
supplement
existing
remedies
and
whether
implication
of
a
federal
cause
of
action
is
required
to
accomplish
congress'
purpose
in
enacting
the
statute.
the
state
of
the
law
was
this,
as
congress
perceived
it,
as
shown
exhaustively
by
the
legislative
history
that
this
court
had
not
definitively
ruled
whether
or
not
custody
cases
were
subject
to
full
faith
and
credit.
states
had
commenced
adopting
uccja,
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act,
on
a
voluntary
basis.
at
the
time
the
federal
legislation
was
originally
suggested,
only
about
19
of
the
states
had
adopted
the
uniform
act
and
the
states
that
had
not
adopted
the
act
were
still
in
the
language
of
the
legislative
history,
havens
for
child
snatchers.
as
the
pkpa
progressed
through
congressional
hearings,
more
and
more
states
adopted
uccja
so
that
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
pkpa,
nearly
all
the
states
had
adopted
uccja.
now,
all
have
adopted
it.
so,
congress
was
looking
at
this
legislative
history
and
they
were
concerned
about
states
that
had
not
adopted
uccja
being
admittedly
havens
for
child
snatchers.
secondly,
the
language
of
the
statute,
itself,
as
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute,
itself,
provides
is
directed
not
at
parties
but,
in
this
instance,
directed
at
the
appropriate
state
authorities,
not
courts,
as
in
full
faith
and
credit.
all
of
the
language
of
pkpa
is
directed
at
state
authorities
and
what
they
shall
and
they
shall
not
do.
the
statutory
scheme
was
this:
originally,
it
was
proposed
to
exempt
parental
kidnapping
from
the
lindberg
kidnapping
statute.
congress
reacted
to
that.
the
federal
courts
should
not
be
in
federal
parental
kidnapping
cases.
the
wallop
proposal
came
along
originally
with
three
proposals:
(1)
to
impose
federal
jurisdictional
standards
on
the
state
in
custody
cases;
(2)
to
make
the
parent
locator
service,
the
federal
parent
locator
service
available
not
to
parties,
but
the
language
says
to
the
states,
make
the
federal
locator
service
available
to
the
states
to
locate
kidnapping
parents
and
kidnapped
children;
and
(3)
was
to
make
it
a
federal
offense
to
kidnap
your
child
in
violation
of
a
proper
court
judgment.
the
third
prong
is
the
one
that
received
most
of
the
attention.
all
the
courts
and
the
legislative
history
is
full
of
the
letter
from
assistant
attorney
general
wald
in
which
the
justice
department
opposed
it,
the
fbi
opposed
it.
hew
opposed
it.
they
did
not
want
the
federal
courts
involved
in,
to
this
extent,
in
this
process.
so,
it
was
as
the
sponsors
time
and
time
again
talk
about.
a
delicate
balance
between
solving
a
problem
which
was
a
legitimate
federal
interest
and
a
minimum
of
federal
intervention
in
what
is
traditionally
a
pure
state
affair:
custody
cases.
the
federal
judiciary
does
not
want
to
be
involved,
nor
should
it
be
involved
in
custody
cases.
so,
a
committee,
the
final
resolution
was
that
instead
of
the
third
prong
of
the
three-pronged
legislation
being
a
federal
offense
that
the
federal
fugitive
act
would
be
made
applicable
to
cases
in
which
a
child
was
taken
by
a
parent
from
one
state
to
another
state
in
violation
of
a
proper
custody
award
ended
in
accordance
with
pkpa.
so
that
under
the
federal
statute,
the
party
could
be
brought
back
and
prosecuted
under
state
law.
so,
as
the
sponsors
themselves
said,
not
in
connection
with
the
rejection
of
the
fish
amendment,
which
is
a
different
proposition,
in
which
senator
cranston,
for
example,
said:
by
reserving
the
federal
role
to
the
creation
of
a
federal
parent
locator
service
and
fbi
investigation
after
a
sufficient
lapse
of
time,
we
hold
federal
interference
to
a
minimum.
and
it
is
very
clear
from
an
extensive
legislative
history
that
right
or
wrong,
that
congress
deliberately,
made
a
deliberate
decision
to
limit
the
federal
interference
in
the
process
to
these
two
things:
making
the
use
of
the
federal
parent
locator
service,
which
at
that
time
was
available
only
for
child
support
purposes,
not
custody
purposes,
and,
secondly,
to
permit
the
use
of
the
federal
fugitive
statute
in
custody
cases.
professor
coombs,
who
wrote
most
of
this
legislation
and
assisted
a
great
deal
in
its
formulation,
said
that
the
legislation
in
it
shows
respect
for
the
proper
division
of
roles
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
and
between
civil
and
criminal
approaches
to
the
problem.
in
the
exchange
between
mr.
conyers
and
representative
fish,
who
had
introduced
a
bill...
there
were
two
bills
pending,
to
confer
diversity
jurisdiction
on
federal
district
courts
in
custody
cases
so
that
a
federal
district
court
could
enforce
a
valid
custody
award.
and
in
that
exchange,
the
differing
approaches
and
the
deliberate
congressional
restraint
is
very
obvious.
mr.
conyers,
actually
mr.
bennett,
that's
pkpa.
mr.
bennett
would
impose
the
obligation
on
state
courts
and
you
would
require
federal
courts
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
decision.
and,
again,
we
would
be
imposing
the
responsibility
of
the
enforcement
upon
the
state
courts.
now,
what
could
be
clearer
with
respect
to
congressional
intent
when
the...
when
congress
is
presented
with
the
contrary
proposal
that
federal
courts
be
granted...
i
grant
you
it
was
not
federal
question
jurisdiction,
but
diversity
jurisdiction,
and
they
expressly
rejected
it
saying
at
the
same
time:
it
is
our
purpose
to
impose
the
enforcement
of
pkpa
on
the
state
courts,
not
the
federal
courts,
as
you,
mr.
fish,
would
have
it.
and
in
the
statutory
scheme
to
explicitly
limit
the
federal
participation
to
the
use
of
federal
parent
locator
service
and
the
use
of
the
federal
fugitive
act
for
the
purposes
of
doing
what?
to
assist
the
states
in
their
enforcement
of
pkpa.
to
allow
them,
when
they
have
issued
a
valid
custody
decree
under
the
pkpa
federal
standards
to
go
to
the
federal
parent
locator
service
and
request
that
the
kidnapping
parent
and
the
abducted
child
be
located
and
when
located
to
then
be
able
to
have
the
fbi
to
bring
the
abducting
parent
back
for
prosecution
in
the
state
court.
and
that
whole
statutory
scheme
is
obvious
in
the
legislative
history
of
pkpa.
nowhere,
i
suggest,
did...
has
any
commentator
or
court
said
that
the
state
courts
have
not
done
their...
performed
their
constitutional
duty
in
enforcing
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
and
this
is
a
form
of
full
faith
and
credit.
it
is
an
addendum
to
full
faith
and
credit.
congress,
many
years
ago,
made
a
deliberate
decision
that
the
implementing
statute
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
would
impose
the
obligation
of
enforcing
the
acts,
statutes
and
so
forth
of
another
state
on
the
state
judicial
systems,
not
on
the
federal
judicial
system
and
this
court
and
the
other
courts
on
many
occasions
have
concurred
in
that
deliberate
decision.
the
decision
of
congress
in
pkpa
is
the
same
kind
of
careful
deliberate
decision.
that
there
was
a
problem
that
needed
to
be
addressed
by
the
federal
legislative
branch.
and
it
addressed
it
in
a
very
careful
and
a
very
deliberate
and
a
very
balancing
manner
between
the
federal
intervention
and
what
is
traditionally
a
state...
you
know,
just
uniquely
a
state
problem,
custody
is.
it
is...
not
just
traditionally,
but
by
its
very
nature
is
a
state
problem.
and
congress
has
made
that
very
deliberate
decision.
what
happens
if
federal
courts
get
involved?
it
has
been
suggested
by
flood
v.
bratton,
which
is
the
third
circuit
case
that
holds
there
is
federal
jurisdiction,
that
federal
courts
need
not
get
involved
in
the
underlying
custody
issues
in
order
to
resolve
conflicting
jurisdictional
assertions
by
states.
i
suggest
that
that
may
reflect
not
a
sophisticated
understanding
of
custody
cases
because
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
their
very
recent
rogers
v.
platt,
that
is
the
very
thing
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
had
to
do
in
order
to
resolve
a
conflict
between
the
district
of
columbia
court
and
a
california
state
court.
it
had
to
determine
factual
issues
that
go
to
the
question
of
custody.
in
the
present
case,
louisiana
recognized
and
enforced
the
california
decree
but
suspended
the
visitation
rights
of
dr.
thompson
because
of
physical
cruelty
by
dr.
thompson
to
his
son
occurring
in
louisiana
during
the
exercise
of
a
visitation
privilege.
that
is
permissible
both
under
uccja
and
pkpa.
professor
coombs,
whom
i
have
quoted
in
my
brief
on
the
subject,
says
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction.
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
or
not
jurisdiction
in
louisiana
in
this
case
is
going
to
depend
upon
whether
dr.
thompson
did
what
we
claimed
he
did.
and,
therefore,
whether
louisiana
correctly
exercised
jurisdiction
under
what
has
been
called
the
emergency
provisions
of
both
uccja
and
pkpa.
so,
courts
aren't
necessarily
going
to
get
involved
in
the
underlying,
undergirding
factual
issues
with
reference
to
custody
in
order
to
determine
which
court
has
jurisdiction
under
pkpa.
another
consideration
is...
and
i
have
asserted
it
in
brief
and
assert
it,
again.
this
honorable
court's
decision
in
webb
v.
webb
and
its
thoughtful
analysis
of
why
state
remedies
ought
to
be
exhausted
before
this
court
is
called
upon
to
resolve
federal
issues
in
what
are
basically
state
causes
of
action.
questions
of
comity,
maintenance
of
a
delicate
balance
between
federal
and
state
judicial
systems.
and,
more
importantly,
the
opportunity
for
state
courts
to
perform
their
duty
and
the
suggestion
that
state
courts,
as
a
system,
will
not
perform
their
constitutional
duty,
i
think
is
reprehensible.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
case
that
louisiana
courts
will
not
perform
their
duty.
in
fact,
i
have
cited
a
case
in
which
i
lost
under
almost
the
identical
facts
in
which
a
state
court
enforced
pkpa
to
my
client's
detriment.
louisiana
courts
will
do
their
duty.
state
courts
will
do
their
constitutional
duty.
the
opportunity
for
state
courts
to
develop
the
record,
the
court
of
appeal
in
this
case
footnotes
time
after
time
the
incomplete
nature
of
the
record.
and
the
state
courts
ought
to
have
the
opportunity
to
develop
the
record,
to
decide,
for
example,
the
case
on
a
non-federal
ground.
these
cases
are
quite
frequently
decided
by
state
courts
on
non-federal
grounds:
not
pkpa.
a
state
court
may
say:
under
our
version
of
uccja,
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
modify
a
texas
decree
or
a
new
jersey
decree
and
so
forth.
and
the
matter
will
never
get
into
the
federal
courts
because
it
has
been
decided
on
a
state
ground.
all
of
this,
of
course,
reduces
the
workload
of
the
federal
judicial
system
which
is
a
consideration.
it
may
not
be
the
paramount
consideration.
i
recognize
in
this
case
that
dr.
thompson
in
brief
has
argued:
it
would
be
useless
for
me
to
go
to
louisiana.
that
it
is
hostile
territory.
i
don't
believe
it
is
hostile
territory.
our
courts
administer
justice
as
do
the
state
systems
of
other
states.
and
i
think
particularly
appropriate
is
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
texaco,
in
which
this
court
said
that
it
did
not...
when
a
litigant
hasn't
presented
his
federal
claims
to
a
state
court,
the
federal
court
should
assume
the
state
procedures
will
afford
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
case...
in
the
absence
of
unambiguous
authority
to
the
contrary.
remember,
dr.
thompson
has
not
made
the
first
attempt
to
enforce
his
california
decree
in
louisiana.
the
only
thing
he
did
was
try
to,
with
an
armed
accomplice,
come
to
louisiana
and
try
to
kidnap
his
boy
instead
of
following
judicial
procedures:
bring
an
action
on
his
california
decree
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
he
doesn't
come
with
great
grace
to
say:
louisiana
won't
give
me
a
fair
shake.
until
he
has
come
to
louisiana
and
seen
what
kind
of
a
shake
that
he
is
going
to
do.
secondly,
rogers
v.
platt
has
pointed
up
an
argument
which
we
have
advanced
as
to
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
jurisdiction
asserted
here.
all
of
the
circuits
that
hold
there
is
jurisdiction
concede
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
enforce
a
state
custody
decree
in
the
first
