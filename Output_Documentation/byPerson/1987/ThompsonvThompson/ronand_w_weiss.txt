mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
we
have
here
is
a
question
as
to
whether
the
paternal
kidnapping
prevention
act
of
1980,
which
is
28
us
1738a,
furnishes
a
private
cause
of
action
in
a
federal
court
to
determine
which
of
two
sister
states'
conflicting
custody
decrees
has
failed
to
comply
with
the
jurisdiction
requirements
of
what
i
will
call
the
pkpa.
the
primary
issue
of
all
the
reported
cases
appears
to
be
the
congressional
intent.
since
there
is
neither
an
expressed
jurisdiction
or
a
prohibition
against
it,
the
question
is
whether
there
is
an
implied
intent
to
give
a
private
cause
of
action.
before
we
get
to
that
particular
point,
i
feel
that
it
is
appropriate
to
discuss
the
background
of
the
pkpa,
itself,
in
order
to
determine
what
congressional
intent
was.
first,
i
think
we
would
have
to
recognize
and
discuss
what
the
problem
was
as
congress
saw
it.
in
joint
hearing
before
the
subcommittee
on
criminal
justice,
senator
malcom
wallop
stated
as
follows:
every
year
between
25,000
and
100,000
children
of
broken
marriages
are
kidnapped
by
a
parent
attempting
forcibly
to
obtain
custody
over
a
child
living
with
the
other
one.
the
emotional
cost
of
child
snatching
which
must
be
borne
in
large
measure
by
young
persons
who
have
already
watched
their
parents'
marriage
fail
and
their
family
split
asunder
is
overwhelming.
what
the
congress
saw
was
25,000
to
100,000
cases
of
people
who
were
unhappy
with
custody
decrees
of
one
state
taking
the
children
from
that
state
and
fleeing
to
other
states
and
obtaining
custody
decrees.
in
that
situation,
there
was
either
no
enforcement
or
little
enforcement
due
to
the
cost
involved
in
travelling
to
the
new
state.
these
are
real
problems.
in
my
case,
my
client
hasn't
seen
his
son
in
seven
years.
this
court
had
a
case
similar
to
this
on
a
different
legal
issue
in
front
of
it
last
term:
the
samolian
case.
and
that
case
brought
to
this
court
the
issue
was
a
writ
of
extradition
which
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
honor,
the
writ
being
issued
by
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
rationale
given
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
that
there
could
not
have
been
a
criminal
act
because
mr.
samolian,
who
was
a
public
defender...
a
deputy
public
defender,
excuse
me,
in
san
bernadino,
had
a
valid
california
custody
order.
this
court
held
that
the
writ
of
extradition
had
to
be
upheld.
and
mr.
samolian
now
is
free
from
the
louisiana
court
on
a
$20,000
bond
and
faces
a
criminal
trial
in
less
than
two
weeks.
this
is
the
type
of
issue
that
congress
wanted
to
address
and
wanted
to
solve.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
well,
we
raised
under
28
us
1331
that
there
is
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
yes,
we
did,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
i
don't
believe
we
did,
no.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
we
raised
it--
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
--existence
or
the
lack
of
it,
but
most
of
the
cases,
as
i
read
them,
dealt
with
the
implied
provision
as
opposed
to
the
actual
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
state
cause
of
action.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
that
is
a
form
of
federal
question...
yes,
chief
justice.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
yes,
we
raised
it
in
our
original
complaint
to
the
lower
court.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
as
i
recall,
the
lower
court
just
summarily
dismissed
it
saying
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever
because
it
was
within
a
domestic
relation
exception.
and
the
court,
the
ninth
circuit
court
held
that
there
was
no
implied
intent
on
congress
to
create
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
further
held
that
the
domestic
relation
exception
was
involved
herein.
those
were
the
two
holdings
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
next
thing
that
i
think
should
be
looked
at
is
what
did
congress
do
or
what
approach
did
they
take
once
they
defined
the
problem.
quoting
senator
mcgovern
in
the
congressional
record
at
senate
page
758
on
january
23,
1979,
he
states
that
the
pk
will
cause
all
states
will
be
required
to
enforce
with
very
few
modifications
allowed
the
custody
decree
of
the
state
that
jurisdiction
according
to
the
provisions
of
the
bill.
and,
at
present,
a
parent
can
take
a
child,
flee
to
another
state
and
begin
court
proceedings
in
that
state
to
regain
custody.
for
several
reasons,
custody
is
usually
granted.
states
treasure
their
independence
to
make
such
decisions.
the
other
parent
is
not
present
to
make
the
case
and
the
absconding
parent
may
be
surrounded
by
supporters
willing
to
testify
on
his
or
on
her
behalf.
under
this
bill,
the
kidnapping
parent
could
not
be
granted
custody
of
the
children
by
any
other
state
court.
this
provision
would
serve
a
possible
childnapper
from
taking
the
child
across
state
lines
as
there
would
be
no
hope
of
gaining
custody
of
the
child
in
another
state.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
read
it
literally,
the
problem
is
the
act,
itself,
speaks
in
a
positive
affirmative
manner.
"the
state
shall".
they
shall
do
this
to
obtain
jurisdiction.
they
shall
not
modify
if
this
exists.
"it
shall".
if
you
take
the
word,
"shall",
with
the
senator's
belief
that
the
states
cannot
grant
custody
under
this
act,
i
think
it
is
reasonable
to
interpret
that
he
meant
that
this
should
be
a
federally
enforced
act.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
yes.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
that's
one
of
the
arguments
raised
that
a
person
should
travel
to
the
other
state
court
and
go
through
the
state
system.
that
does...
that
creates
a
couple
of
problems.
(1)
is
that
you
have
the
practical
problem
of
the
total
lack
of
following
of
the
pkpa.
the
second
is
that
it
is
almost
an
impractical
problem
for
most
people
involved
because
of
the
cost.
the
third
problem
is
that
the
going
to
the
other
state,
you
submit
to
their
jurisdiction.
if
you
read
the
uccjas
in
like
louisiana,
you
submit
to
their
jurisdiction.
and
then
you
have
a
difficult-time
in
challenging
the
uccja
of
louisiana.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
well,
there
was
discussion
of
federal--
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
--there
was
some
discussion
by
senator
cranston
referring
to
the
attention
being
directed
at
the
problem
in
the
federal
level.
there
was
some
discussion
by
congressman
duncan
to
that
effect.
there
was
nothing
that
i
read
that
specifically
rejected
the
concept
of
federal
jurisdiction.
some
of
the
cases
talk
about
congressman
fish's
proposal.
but,
if
you
look
at
congressman
fish's
proposal,
it
is
one
of
five
proposals
in
this
area
and
it
is
the
only
proposal
that
suggests
that
the
federal
courts
take
jurisdiction
to
make
child
custody
decisions.
it
further
suggested
that
we
do
away
with
the
$10,000
diversity
requirement.
this
was
the
only
proposal
that
directly
talked
about
federal
jurisdiction,
but
it
was
rejected
because
the
congress
did
not
want
to
burden
the
federal
court
with
custody
determinations.
but
we
are
not
asking
for
custody
determination
here.
what
we
are
asking
the
federal
court
to
do
is
to
make
a
determination
based
on
the
pkpa
as
to
who
properly
and
correctly
applied
it.
i
believe
the
minority
decision
in
merrell
dow
pharmaceutical
v.
thompson
said
that
the
federal
courts
are
the
best
equipped
to
make
a
decision
or
an
interpretation
of
the
federal
legislation,
since
they
do
it
on
a
regular
basis.
and
they
further
stated
the
state
courts
are
not
as
well
equipped
to
do
that.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
well,
the
ninth
circuit
addressed
that
problem
and
talked
about
the
type
of
acts
that
dr.
clay
had
committed
in
the
jurisdiction.
and
they
concluded
on
the
following:
(1)
that
she
and
the
child
resided
there
for
most
of
the
child's
life;
(2)
that
she
had
made
use
of
the
california
superior
court
by
bringing
the
domestic
action
in
that
court;
(3)
that
dr.
thompson's
request
was
based
on
the
california
decree;
and,
(4)
that
dr.
clay
left
the
state
of
california
and
went
to
louisiana
and
allegedly
enforced
the
california
decree
there
in
louisiana.
based
on
that
analysis,
they
felt
that
there
was
jurisdiction.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
the
child?
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
that
is
a
problem
that
the
pkpa
can
solve.
if
we
do
not
get
federal
determination
of
the
construction
and
who
properly
applied
that,
we
could
travel
to
louisiana,
as
was
suggested,
and
we
could
go
through
the
whole
court
and
then
dr.
clay
could
then
move
to
another
state--
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
--hopefully
with
a
federal
court
order
that
will
be
obeyed.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
i'm
sorry?
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
well,
if
it
is
determined
that
california
was
the
appropriate
jurisdiction
and
louisiana
is
restrained,
then
california
would,
in
all
probability,
issue
an
arrest
warrant
like
was
done
in
samolian
by
the
louisiana
state.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
for
dr.
clay,
probably.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
yes.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
no.
we
can
do
that
through
the
state
court.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
through
the
state
court.
see,
if
the
court...
if
the
federal
court
finds--
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
--we
are
going
to
do
it
by
trying
to
get
the
state
court
to
issue
a
writ
of
extradition
for
dr.
clay
and,
hopefully,
she
would
bring
the
child
rather
than
go
through
that.
i
mean
we
have
tried
self-help.
self-help
is--
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
--that's
correct.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
they
cannot,
but
the
federal
court
can
determine
that
california
was
the
proper
court
for
jurisdiction
of
the
custody
case.
and
once
they
determine
that,
then
california
can
issue
the
child
stealing
warrant.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
well,
now,
as
discussed,
what
the
congress
did
was
they
passed
the
parental
kidnapping
prevention
act
and
they
passed
it
in
positive
terms.
while
a
state...
state
courts
shall
enforce
and
state
courts
shall
cooperate.
they
made
those
mandatory
requirements.
if
the
federal
court
does
not
take
jurisdiction,
the
federal
act,
the
pkpa,
has
become
nothing
but
an
advisory
or
an
optional
act
that
the
states
can
follow
or
not
follow
at
their
choice.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
the
problem
is
that
the
pkpa,
if
as
some
of
the
writings
have
suggested
is
strictly
advisory,
are
an
extension
of
the
uccja,
then
in
a
lot
of
states
there
will
be
a
conflict
between
the
uccja
and
the
pkpa.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
no.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
that
would
be
my
assumption,
but
it
would
be
up
to
the
interpretation
of
the
state
court.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
i
have
heard
that
argument.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
from
the
ninth
circuit.
[laughter]
and
from
the
d.c.
or
most
recent
case.
the
problem
there
is
you
are
dealing
with
child
custody
and
you
see
if
a...
if
a
party
steals
a
child
and
goes
to
another
state,
and
we
go
through
your
procedure
of
going
to
that
state
and
going
up
through
their
appellate
process
and
eventually
ending
up
here
five...
four
or
five
years
have
passed.
and
it
becomes
almost
a
worthless
act
not...
i
do
not
mean
that
in
any
derogatory
sense,
but
to
the
person
who
is
pursuing
his
child,
because
he
has
lost
all
contact
with
his
child.
the
child
doesn't
know
him.
very
few
state
courts
would
say
after
five
or
six
years,
"i'm
going
to
give
you
custody.
"
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
well,
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
--well,
it
is
not
even
a
mistake.
it's
if
you
look
at
the
uccja
of
louisiana,
it
says
that
you
are
not
supposed
to
take
custody...
jurisdiction
for
custody
purposes
until
the
child
has
been
there
for
a
period
of
six
months.
looking
at
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
--i
will
agree
and
i
am
sorry
if
i
made
that
assumption.
my
primary
concern
is
that
the
pkpa
sets
a
federal
standard
for
a
jurisdiction
and
modification
of
custody
acts.
and
it
is
a
method
whereby
if
it
is
applied
properly,
we
will
get
a
uniform
standard
for
jurisdiction
between
the
states.
but
in
order
to
apply
it
in
a
standard
manner
and
an
expeditious
manner,
in
order
to
create
what
is
necessary
in
the
custody,
the
immediacy
of
the
custody
issues,
it
has
to
be
determined
in
a
standard
way
by
a
court
that
can
bind
two
state
courts.
suppose
you
get
conflicting
interpretations
of
the
pkpa
in
two
different
states.
you
are
no
different
than
you
are
with
the
uccja.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
i
understand
that,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
well,
if
you
review
the
minority
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit,
justice
alcorn
makes
some
comments
about
the
failure
to
recognize
a
federal
jurisdiction
and
i
think
the
comments
reflect
that
he
found
an
intent
of
congress
to
create
the
federal
jurisdiction.
he
says,
otherwise,
it
converts
an
act
of
congress
into
barren
rhetoric.
the
third
circuit
said
basically
the
same
thing.
why
would
the
congress
from
1973
to
1980
study
and
attempt
to
pass
legislation
on
this
problem
to
correct
the
problem,
acknowledge
that
the
problem
exists,
that
the
states
will
not
uniformly
apply
the
uccja,
which
is
supposed
to
be
a
uniform
act,
and
then
not
give
the
courts,
the
federal
courts
the
ability
to
enforce
it.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
well,
full
faith,
justice
scalia,
the
full
faith
credit
statute
is
a
little
different
in
that
the
pkpa
1738a
sets
standards.
it
says,
"the
state
shall".
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
on
the
full
faith
and
credit,
you
also
have
the
problem
that
this
is
a
child
custody
determination
and
full
faith
and
credit
only
has
to
be
given
by
one
state
to
the
other
state
to
the
same
enforceability
that
other
states
order.
by
that,
if
there
is
a
change
of
circumstances,
it
can
be
modifiable.
so,
there
is
never
really
a
full
faith
and
credit
argument.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
that's...
if
you
take
that
position,
chief
justice,
then
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
the
modifiability
aspect
of
the
child
custody
decision
because
full
faith
and
credit
is
given
to
a
final
judgment.
and
the
child
custody
judgment
is
never
final
because
it
can
be
modified
all
the
time.
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
no,
it
is
not,
chief
justice.
one
last
point,
since
i
see
the
white
light
is
on.
the
merrell
dow
pharmaceutical
v.
thompson
case
talks
about
implied
jurisdiction.
in
that
case,
the
majority
starts
with
that
there
is
no
implied
jurisdiction.
and
they
run
the
four-pronged
test
of
cort,
c-o-r-t.
now,
the
court
case
has
been
briefed...
the
court
test
has
been
briefed
by
myself,
starting
with
page
8.
i
believe
that
the
minority
and
majority
decision
in
that
case
are
very
close.
they
both
say
that
the
smith
v.
kansas
city
trust
is
an
applicable
valid
test
and
that
it
should
be
applied.
the
difference
is
that
the
majority
found
that
there
was
no
implied
jurisdiction
here.
i
believe
if
you
look
at
the
intent
of
congress
there
is
an
implied
intent
here
and,
as
such,
the
court
should
allow
the
lower
federal
courts
to
hear
this
matter.
i
would
have
nothing
further.
are
there
any
questions,
chief
justice?
mr.
ronand
w.
weiss
thank
you,
chief
justice.
