yes,
but
you
cannot
presume
that
every
case
will
be
a
test
case.
you
can't
presume
that
every
case
will
require
resolution
by
this
court.
if
you
presume
that
generally
state
courts
will
follow
the
governing
law,
presumably
in
this
case
the
louisiana
appellate
courts
would
have
corrected
the
error.
and
that
would
not
have
taken
five
or
six
years.
maybe
there
will
be
an
exceptional
case
where
there
is
ambiguity
in
the
law
and
this
court
has
to
lay
down
the
rule
of
law.
but
in
most
cases,
why
don't
you
presume
that
state
judges
will
obey
the
law?
justice
stevens
maybe
they
made
a
mistake
in
this
one
case,
but
does
that
mean
that
they
always
are
going
to
make
mistakes
and
rule
in
favor
of
the
local
parent?
justice
stevens
is
that
even
right?
isn't
the
right
of
action
a
suit
for
custody
created
by
state
law
and
merely
the
federal
law
imposes
certain
standards
to
be
applied
in
state
causes
of
action.
