justice

we
are
assuming
no
overbreadth
here.
i
mean,
that's...
i
thought
this
whole
discussion
was
on
the
assumption
of
no
overbreadth
principle
applicable.
justice
scalia
mr.
mansfield,
you
have
to
acknowledge
at
least
this
difference,
that
where
what
is
being
defended
is
association
on
the
basis
of
furthering
ideas,
it
doesn't
matter
how
large
the
organization
is,
it
could
be
the
american
civil
liberties
union
or
any
nationwide
organization
with
thousands
of
members,
whereas
we
have
made
it
clear
that
the
associational
right
that
we
have
referred
to
where
such
political
or
ideological
purposes
do
not
exist
only
applies
to
intimate
association.
we
never
talk
about
intimate
association
as
far
as
political
belief
is
concerned,
do
we?
justice
scalia
and
we
give
more
protection
to
one
than
to
the
other.
justice
scalia
of
course,
but
mr.
zimroth,
if
that
is
enough
to
prevent
a
facial
challenge,
then
there
can
never
be
a
facial
challenge
because
every
statute
is
always
subject
to
a
constitutional
challenge
as
applied.
justice
scalia
it
is
not?
justice
scalia
you
are
switching
to
overbreadth...
i
am
sorry,
go
ahead.
justice
scalia
mr.
zimroth,
could
i
ask--
justice
scalia
--mr.
zimroth,
if
there
is
a
private
right
of
association
in
clubs
it
is
not
very
explicitly
set
forth
in
the
constitution
anyway.
one
of
the
protections
that
is
quite
explicit
is,
whatever
laws
you
pass,
the
real
protection
is,
it
has
to
apply
to
everybody.
now,
this
law
was
passed
with
an
exclusion
of
such
groups
as
the
elks,
the
moose,
the
american
legion,
and
i
gather
there
was
some
testimony
that
that
exclusion
was
somewhat
politically
necessary.
justice
scalia
what
is
the
basis
for
that
exclusion?
why
is
that
a
rational
exclusion?
i
mean,
if
this
is
a
good
law
it
ought
to
apply
to
everybody.
justice
scalia
let's
take
a
criminal
statute.
suppose
you
have
legislative
hearings
similar
to
the
ones
you
had
here,
and
the
city
council
is
considering
an
anti-bribery
statute,
and
its
hearings
show
that
by
and
large
people
who
make
more
than
$100,000
don't
take
bribes.
they
don't
really
need
it.
it
is
not
a
real
problem.
so
you
pass
a
bribery
law
that
says
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
take
a
bribe
unless
you
make
more
than
$100,000
a
year
because
there
is
really
no
public
need
for
a
law.
now,
do
you
think
that
satisfies
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
if
there
is
no
problem
for
elks
or
the
mystic
order
or
what-not,
then
they
have
nothing
to
worry
about.
if
they
are
not
covered
by
the
statute
they
are
not
covered
by
it.
what
is
the
rational
basis
for
simply
saying
from
the
start
this
great
and
good
statute
is
not
going
to
apply
to
these
groups?
justice
scalia
to
make
sure
the
legislators
are
not
legislating
against
my
club
but
not
against
their
own
clubs,
which
is
the
whole
purpose
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
scalia
they
don't
take
bribes.
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
scalia
that's
what
the
statute
says,
counsel.
