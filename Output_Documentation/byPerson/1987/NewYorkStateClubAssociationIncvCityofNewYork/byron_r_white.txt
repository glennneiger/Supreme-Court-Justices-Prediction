justice
white
what
about
the
ordinance
itself?
does
it
provide
for...
does
it
permit
a
club
to
claim
that
even
though
it
satisfies
the
criteria,
that
its
constitutional
rights
are
being
violated?
justice
white
so
the
effect
of
the
ordinance
is
that
case
by
case
determination
of
constitutionality
in
application
is
precluded.
justice
white
how
did
this
case
get
started?
justice
white
by
your
client?
justice
white
and
you
mounted
a
facial
attack,
didn't
you?
justice
white
and
so
your
claim
was
that
the
law
could
not
be
constitutionally
applied
in
any
way?
justice
white
and
you
think
overbreadth
applies
in
this
context?
justice
white
well,
this
is
sort
of
a
commercial
regulation,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
for
a
moment
that
the
overbreadth
analysis
does
not
apply.
would
you
still
win?
justice
white
because
in
any
single
case...
there
is
no
case
you
can
imagine
where
this
law
could
be
constitutionally
applied?
justice
white
can
you
imagine
any
club
that...
where
any
such
a
claim
would
be...
would
just
always
fail?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
are
saying
that
every
club
that
you
can
imagine
would
have...
this
law
would,
if
it
were
applied,
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
let's
suppose
that
we
agreed
with
you
they
applied
the
wrong
test,
and
we
said,
well,
the
right
test
is
so
and
so
but
this
law
is
perfectly
constitutional
under
the
right
test.
you
wouldn't
affirm...
you
wouldn't
reverse
the
judgment
below,
you
would
affirm
it.
justice
white
well,
suppose
we
thought
that
applying
the
right
test,
if
this...
if
the
test
below
was
wrong,
if
we
applied
the
right
test,
suppose
we
thought
the
ordinance
passed
constitutional
muster?
we
would
affirm.
justice
white
well,
your
court
of
appeals
said
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
determine
that
a
large
club
which
received
substantial
business-related
income
from
nonmembers,
that
the
law
can
reach,
constitutionally
reach
clubs
like
that.
now,
that
is
a
construction
of
this
ordinance,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
it
just
isn't
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
justice
white
well,
would
you
say
that...
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
even
if
the
club
received
what
you
would
agree
is
substantial
income
from
nonmembers
connected
with
business,
you
would
say
that
this
law
is
unconstitutional
with
respect
to
those
clubs,
i
guess.
justice
white
well,
can
you
think
of
a
club
that
the
ordinance
could
constitutionally
be
applied
to?
justice
white
no
matter
how
substantial
the
return
from
nonmembers
is.
justice
white
you
can't
find
that
provision
in
the
ordinance.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
can't
find
it
in
the...
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
it
just
seems
to
say
that
when
the
three
prongs
are
proved,
that
is
the
end
of
the
ball
game.
justice
white
well,
mr.
zimroth,
even
if
your
agency
that
enforces
this
law
would
never
permit
any
claimed
defense
of
unconstitutionality
as
applied,
i
suppose
that
you
wouldn't
necessarily
lose
this
case.
you
could
still
say
that,
well,
there
are
certainly
plenty
of
clubs
to
which
this
law
could
be
constitutionally
applied
and
any
claim,
any
unconstitutional
defense
would
be
frivolous.
justice
white
yes,
but
suppose
we
don't
have
all
this
trouble
that
you
do
of
imagining
a
club
that
would
have
a
good
defense
on
a
constitutional
basis.
suppose
that
is
so,
and
we
just
disagree
with
you.
what
about
overbreadth?
justice
white
well,
because
if
there
are
some
clubs
that
this
law
couldn't
be
constitutionally
applied
to,
a
substantial
number
of
them,
and
if
overbreadth
applies,
i
suppose--
justice
white
--this
whole
statute,
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
white
well,
suppose
we
think
there
are
a
substantial
number.
do
you
think
overbreadth
applies
in
this
case?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
but
doesn't
this
ordinance,
at
the
bottom
line
it
talks
about
business
purposes.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
filed
an
opinion
in
this
case
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york.
our
judgment
is
unanimous.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
kennedy
has
joined
that
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
