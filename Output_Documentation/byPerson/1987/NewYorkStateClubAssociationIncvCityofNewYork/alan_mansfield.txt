mr.
alan
mansfield
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
a
classic
conflict
between
competing
american
values,
the
fundamental
right
of
our
citizens
to
associate,
elect
who
their
friends
will
be
in
places
which
are
private
social
settings
and
the
state's
interest
in
providing
equal
opportunities
for
people
in
places
which
are
public.
to
foster
equal
opportunity,
places
like
new
york
city
and
other
jurisdictions
throughout
the
country
have
enacted
public
accommodations
laws.
these
laws
in
places
again
which
are
truly
public
prohibit
discrimination,
but
to
secure
the
personal
liberties
which
are
basic
to
our
society
and
which
permit
social
clubs
to
exist
in
the
first
instance,
new
york
city's
law,
like
many
other
jurisdictions,
exempts
private
clubs
from
the
definition
of
place
of
public
accommodation.
this
exemption
strikes
a
fair
balance
between
the
competing
values
to
associate
on
one
hand
and
the
state's
interest
in
antidiscrimination
principles
on
the
other.
local
law
63
is
an
amendment
to
new
york
city's
public
accommodations
law,
and
specifically
to
the
distinctly
private
club
exemption.
its
irrebuttable
presumption
based
on
a
crazy
guilt
three-prong
test
impermissibly
precludes
a
club
from
demonstrating
relevant
factors.
mr.
alan
mansfield
the
corporation
counsel's
brief
in
fact
takes
that
position
now
for
the
first
time.
looking
at
the
court
of
appeals
decision
itself,
however,
i
think,
makes
quite
clear
that
for
purposes
of
a
club
which
is
claiming
a
right
to
private
association,
that
club
is
bound
by
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
the
context
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
was
writing
was
nysca's
challenge
under
the
state
constitutional
inconsistency
provision
that
the
three
prongs
of
local
law
63
were
inconsistent
with
the
general
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
new
york
state
has
a
statute
which
is
a
statewide
provision
which
is
also
a
public
accommodation
statute,
and
it
has
a
distinctly
private
exemption,
just
like
the
old
new
york
city
law
did.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
power
squardons
case
had
construed
that
exemption.
nysca
argued
below
that
the
three
prongs
of
local
law
63,
again
under
the
state
constitution,
were
inconsistent
with
the
five
prongs
of
power
squadrons.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
argument
on
the
ground
that
the
five
prongs
of
power
squadrons
were
permissive
factors,
and
since
they
were
permissive,
then
another
jurisdiction
would
be
free
to
pass
consistent
provisions,
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
three
prongs
were
consistent.
the
critical
point
here,
though,
is
that
or
purposes
of
determining
that
a
club
is
not
distinctly
private,
a
trier
of
fact
sitting
in
the
city
human
rights
commission
is
entitled
to
look
at
as
many
factors
as
he
or
she
wishes.
to
that
extent
indeed
it
is
permissive,
but
once
a
club
meets
the
three
prongs,
it
is
deemed
to
be
not
entitled
to
the
distinctly
private
exemption.
the
purpose--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--it
becomes
irrebuttable.
it
is
not
a
strong
presumption.
mr.
alan
mansfield
i
don't
think
that
would
be
necessary.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
quite
clear
on
its
face.
the
court
of
appeals
says
at
page
11a
of
the
record
that
once
a
club
meets
the
three
factors
it
is
deemed
to
be
large
and
not
selective
enough
to
be
entitled
to
the
freedom
of
association.
indeed,
this
is
the
position
that
corporation
counsel
has
argued
throughout
both
in
this
litigation
and
in
the
enforcement
proceedings
which
are
pending
in
the
state
of
new
york.
in
the
reply
brief
i
have
cited
a
memorandum
of
law
submitted
by
corporation
counsel
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision
came
down
in
which
it
takes
the
very
same
position
that
seems
to
us
to
be
clear
from
the
face
of
the
record.
there
is
not
an
ambiguity
here
in
state
law
determination.
mr.
alan
mansfield
it
does
not,
and
to
the
contrary
the
language
of
the
statute
could
not
be
more
clear.
the
statute
says
that
an
institution,
club,
or
place
of
accommodation
shall
not
be
considered
in
its
nature
distinctly
private
if
it
meets
the
prongs.
mr.
alan
mansfield
it
is
precluded.
once
a
club
meets
the
three
prongs
it
is
automatically
in
violation
of
city
law
if
it
discriminates
in
any
fashion.
the
purpose
again
of
the
private
club
exemption
was
to
strike
that
fair
balance
between
competing
american
values.
local
law
63
is
in
fact
an
irrebuttable
presumption
based
on
these
three
factors.
mr.
alan
mansfield
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
alan
mansfield
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
understand
that
many
statutes
necessarily
draw
lines
of
all
kinds,
and
some
will
be
impacted
by
it,
some
won't.
the
point
here,
however,
is
that
the
analytical
framework
for
a
club's
exercise
of
its
freedom
of
association
has
set
forth
in
two
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
first
in
roberts
and
later
in
rotary,
just
last
term,
this
court
without
dissent
set
forth
the
proper
analytical
framework,
and
that
framework
said
that
a
club
should
be
able
to
demonstrate
and
a
trier
of
fact
should
carefully
assess
all
of
the
objective
characteristics
which
would
be
relevant
to
determine
whether
a
club
is
or
is
not
private.
the
court
went
on
in
both
of
those
decisions
to
identify
the
kinds
of
factors
which
should
be
considered.
those
factors
included
the
purpose
of
a
club.
mr.
alan
mansfield
i
agree,
your
honor.
however,
i
think
that
both
of
those
opinions
were
setting
forth
a
constitutional
framework.
both
were
considering
the
competing
values
again
of
the
freedom
to
associate,
and
when
that
freedom
to
associate
can
attach,
and
the
fact
that
a
private
club
may
under
some
circumstances
be
entitled
to
exercise
that
freedom
to
associate,
that
members
of
that
club
have
the
right
to
choose
who
their
friends
will
be
free
of
government
regulation,
free
of
government
scrutiny
of
the
membership
policies
and
operations
of
the
club.
that
framework
is
decidedly
different
from
the
tack
that
local
law
63
takes,
whereas
the
roberts
and
rotary
rationale
are
solicitous
of
claims
to
the
freedom
of
association--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--this
case
was
started
in
the
state
court
in
new
york
city.
it
was
a--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--by
my
client,
the
new
york
state
club
association.
mr.
alan
mansfield
it
was
a
pre-enforcement
facial
attack.
mr.
alan
mansfield
that
it
could
not
be
constitutionally
applied
in
any
case,
and
that
it
was
overbroad
on
its
face,
yes.
mr.
alan
mansfield
i
think
overbreadth
does
apply
in
this
context
because
there
are--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--the
provision
may
have
intended
to
be
a
commercial
regulation.
it
may
have
been
the
legislative
intent
to--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--i
think
we
would
win,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
mansfield
that's
correct,
because
the
law
employs
a
fundamentally
incorrect
analysis
of
the
freedom
to
associate,
whereas
the
court
in
roberts
and
rotary
thought
that
factors
again
such
as
selectivity
in
beginning
and
maintenance
of
a
relationship,
the
exclusion
of
others
from
critical
aspects
of
the
relationship,
that
those
should
be
the
factors
which
would
determine
whether
a
club's
members
can
decide
whether
they
can
have
their
own
friends
free
from
government
intrusion,
but
that
is
a
constitutional
standard.
the
irrebuttable
presumption,
the
three
prongs
take
a
decidedly
different
tack.
mr.
alan
mansfield
size
is
relevant,
and
in
fact,
justice--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--it
wasn't
mentioned,
although
we
believe
it
is
a
relevant
factor,
perhaps
not
the
most
probative.
mr.
alan
mansfield
a
relevant
factor.
mr.
alan
mansfield
it,
too,
would
be
a
relevant
factor.
mr.
alan
mansfield
well,
it
is
conceivable
that
there
is
a
class
of
cases
in
which
a
club,
for
example,
like
the
rotaries
or
the
jcs
under
any
test,
even
if
one
employs
a
fundamentally
wrong
premise,
would
have
the
same
result,
that
doesn't
make
the
test
any
more
constitutional,
much
like
in
the
court's
decisions
in
munson
and
schaumburg.
in
munson
and
schaumburg,
it
is
conceivable
there
would
have
been
those
out
there
trying
to
solicit
funds
who
were
engaged
in
fraudulent
charitable
activities,
so
the
overbroad
law
as
applied
to
that
class
of
individuals
would
have
the
same
result
as
if
the
law
were
more
narrowly
fashioned.
it
is
the
same
here.
there
are--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--the
court
has
used
overbreadth
in
two
distinct
contexts,
as
justice
brockman
pointed
out
in
the
munson
case,
both
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional
with
respect
to
the
facts
that
are
set
forth
by
the
plaintiff
and
also
in
the
classic
sense
of
overbreadth
where
even
if
the
law
properly
regulates
the
conduct
of
plaintiff,
nevertheless
there
are
others
whose
rights
will
be
chilled.
and
indeed
we
make
the
challenge
to
this
law
on
both
grounds,
but
with
respect
to
the
class
of
clubs
represented
by
the
new
york
state
club
association,
this
law,
because
again
it
employs,
just
like
in
schaumburg
and
munson,
a
fundamentally
misguided
test,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
in
every
application.
mr.
alan
mansfield
again,
it
is
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
it
prohibits
any
club,
and
the
clubs
represented
by
the
new
york
state
club
association,
to
show
that
there
are
other
factors.
mr.
alan
mansfield
what
is
wrong
with
this
particular
law
is
not
that
it
draws
lines,
but
that
the
three
prongs
that
it
has
chosen
to
look
at
are
demonstrably
different
from
the
constitutional
analysis
the
court
set
forth
in
roberts
and
rotary.
the
very
factors
which
a
club
would
want
to
show
to
demonstrate
that
it
should
be
entitled
to
practice
the
freedom
of
association,
those
very
factors
are
precluded
by
local
law
63.
once
a
club
meets
the
three
prongs,
it
cannot
show
a
trier
of
fact
for
purposes
of
winning
the
exemption
that
it
would
otherwise
have
been...
have
sought
refuge
under
roberts
and
rotary,
that
the
kind
of
analysis
that
the
court
engaged
in
both
looking
at
the
rotaries--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--not
a
club
which
would
otherwise
be
protected
by
roberts
and
rotary.
mr.
alan
mansfield
i
am
saying
that
the
law
is
premised
on
a
fundamentally
misguided
and
wrong
test,
and
just
as
your
honor's
decision
in
schaumburg
pointed
out,
the
75
percent
rule
was
a
fundamentally
misguided
test.
the
fact
that
the
village
of
schaumburg
sought
to
eliminate
fraud
was
a
bona
fide--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
because
the
test
is
fundamentally
in
error,
and
in
error
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
analysis
that
is
required
by
roberts
and
rotary.
the
mere
fact
that
it
is--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--if
in
fact
the
test
was
a
right
test,
if
in
fact
the
three
prongs
met
all
of
the
constitutional
concerns
set
forth
in
roberts
and
rotary,
then
in
fact
the
court
would
affirm
on
that
part
of
the
argument.
with
respect
to
the
overbreadth
part
of
the
argument,
on
the
other
hand,
which
clearly
would
apply
here
because
the
other
wing
of
the
freedom
to
associate
is
the
freedom
for
expressive
association,
and
of
course
the
right
of
clubs
to
get
together,
of
political
organizations
to
get
together
which
are
clearly
protected
under
the
expressive
association
cases,
was
chilled
by
this
law.
if
it
has
400
members,
if
it
has
regular
food
service,
if
it
has
regular
receipt
of
income
under
the
third
prong
of
the
test
then
it
would
be
forced
to
take
in
a
member
it
may
not
wish
to
have,
which
could
very
well,
just
the
admission
of
that
member,
interfere
with
the
definition
and
purpose
of
the
club.
mr.
alan
mansfield
the
clubs
represented
by
nysca
are
primarily
those
which
are
social
clubs,
clubs
which
are
organized
four
purposes
of
social
intercourse
and
recreational
pursuits.
mr.
alan
mansfield
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
mansfield
i
think
the
court
has
in
the
past
talked
about
the
freedom
of
association
protecting
not
only
the
direct
advancement
of
beliefs
but
in
coats
versus
city
of
cincinnati
the
court
mentioned
that
social
expression
was
equally
protected.
i
don't
think
the
court
should
engaged
in
a
sliding
scale
of
protection
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
freedom.
mr.
alan
mansfield
well,
i
understand
that
in--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--i
think
that--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--i
think
that
the
facts
are
very
much
different,
but
i
think
the
principle
is
very
much
the
same,
and
that
the
freedom
of
association
is
in
fact
a
fundamentally
protected
right.
mr.
alan
mansfield
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
two
prongs
of
the
freedom
of
association.
in
roberts
and
in
rotary,
both
of
those
clubs
were
analyzed
under
both
prongs,
the
first,
the
right
to
private
association,
a
right
which
derives
out
of
the
liberty
clause
of
the
constitution;
the
second
was
a
right
of
expressive
association,
which
finds
its
roots
more
directly
in
first
amendment
cases.
these
are
two
aspects
of
the
freedom
to
associate.
mr.
alan
mansfield
once
an
association,
an
organization
a
couple
is
protected
by
the
right
of
private
association,
indeed,
i
believe
that
is
given
more
protection
than
expressive
association.
the
state
would
not
be
able
to
enter
into
intimate
relationships
which
are
protected
by
the
liberty
clause,
and
i
think
that
the
analysis
of
roberts
and
rotary
was
to
determine
whether
a
social
club
can
be
protected
under
that
same
line
of
cases,
the
cases
that
began
with
family
rights
involved.
mr.
alan
mansfield
well,
i
think
that's
correct,
and
i
think
certainly
as
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
roberts,
relative
smallness
is
one
of
the
factors
that
should
be
considered.
mr.
alan
mansfield
i
don't
have
a
guideline
to
offer
the
court.
mr.
alan
mansfield
i
think
there
shouldn't
be,
and
i
think
that's
what
justice
brennan
meant
when
he
said
relative
smallness,
not
just
smallness.
indeed,
the
jc's
local
that
was
before
the
court
in
the
roberts
case
had...
were
in
itself
sufficient
to
defeat
any
constitutional
right,
the
court
would
not
have
had
to
go
forward
in
the
decision.
it
could
simply
have
thrown
the
case
out
on
the
ground
of
400.
instead,
the
court
focused
on
relative
smallness.
when
you
look
at
the
400
prong
of
local
law
63,
we
can
look
at
such
features,
for
example,
as
continuity
of
the
relationship.
is
the
core
of
the
400
the
same
group
of
people
who
have
been
together
for
a
long
period
of
time?
who
uses
the
club
on
a
regular
basis?
is
a
small
percentage
of
the
total
membership
really
the
percentage
of
people
who
use
the
club
day
in
and
day
out?
these
are
at
least
relevant
factors
that
a
trier
of
fact
should
be
able
to
take
into
consideration
in
determining
whether
the
club
meets
the
relative
smallness
analysis
of
rotary.
mr.
alan
mansfield
i
think
that
would
be
a
much
closer
case,
and
certainly
a
trier--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--if
it
were,
again,
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
mr.
alan
mansfield
if
it
made
it
so
that
in
determination
of
whether
you
have
constitutional
rights
or
not,
was
not
three
prongs
and
you
are
out.
as
long
as
you
would
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
notwithstanding
the
commercial
aspect
there
are
reasons
that
you
might
still
be
private.
local
law
63
is
a
good
example.
the
third--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--that
may
not
be,
but
the
third
prong
of
local
law
63
nowhere
on
its
face
requires
that
the
business
activity
be
substantial.
it
doesn't
even
require
that
it
be
significant.
under
the
regulations
which
were
before
the
court
of
appeals,
indeed,
it
can
be
trivial.
the
fact
that
there
is
trivial
business
that
is
conducted
at
a
club
should
certainly
be
a
relevant
feature.
the
third
prong,
while
it
does
have
a
business
component,
as
justice
greenfield
put
in
his
decision
denying
our
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
doesn't
even
make
sense
with
respect
to
furthering
the
purposes
of
the
law.
mr.
alan
mansfield
you
might
very
well.
mr.
alan
mansfield
because
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
analysis
in
roberts
and
rotary
at
bottom
said
that
a
club
should
be
able
to
at
least
try
to
prove
before
a
trier
of
fact
every
probative
factor.
if
the
club
is--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--and
if
the
400
people
are
the
same
400
people--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--or
others,
and
with
respect
to
the
third
prong--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
mansfield
it
was
an
effort.
mr.
alan
mansfield
we
don't
challenge
the
legislative
purpose.
at
stake
here
is
not
the
question
of
whether
a
legislature
can
pass
a
law
in
which
it
seeks
to
provide
equal
opportunities
in
places
which
are
truly
public.
what
is
wrong
about
this
law
is
the
means
that
was
chosen.
that
is
what
violates
the
constitution.
the
fact
that
it
can
be
trivial
income
to
a
club,
the
fact
that
income
could
have
nothing
to
do
whatsoever
with
the
business
of
the
members,
thus
if
it
is
a
small
club,
and
in
order
to
make
its
real
estate
tax
payments
without
raising
dues
beyond
the
limits
of
the
club
members,
it
rents
its
facilities
out
on
a
weekly
basis,
rents
it
out
to
a
local
business
to
use
for
cocktail
parties,
none
of
the
club
members
attend
that
cocktail
party,
and
none
of
the
people
who
are
at
the
cocktail
party
have
any
right
to
any
aspect
of
the
club.
at
least
that
factor
should
be
relevant
to
determining
whether
these
clubs
are
marketplaces.
the
objective
of
the
legislature
is
not
drawn
into
question
in
this
litigation.
if
indeed
the
local
law
63
was
addressed
to
pointing
out
just
marketplaces,
what
the
preamble
says
that
the
legislature
was
seeking
to
open
up
to
the
public,
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
it
chose
local
law
63.
local
law
63
is
fundamentally
in
contrast
to--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--i
believe
it
is
not
a
construction
of
the
ordinance.
it
is
simply
saying
that
if
there
is
substantial
income
and
large
clubs,
that
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
roberts
analysis
for
determining
that
a
club
is
not
distinctly
private.
this
particular
ordinance
has
been
construed
by
administrative
regulations.
those
administrative
regulations
issued
by
the
city
human
rights
commission
say
quite
clearly
that
the
receipt
of
nonmember
income
for
as
many
weeks
as
the
year
that
the
business...
the
club
is
in
operation
is
sufficient
to
meet
the
term
"regularly".
therefore
trivial
income,
if
one
member
of
a
club
of
450
on
a
weekly
basis
takes
one
client
to
lunch,
and
deducts
that
payment,
even
though
the
rest
of
the
club
members
engaged
purely
in
recreational
or
social
activities,
even
though
the
$520
of
52
$10
chits
are
a
tiny
proportion
of
the
club's
revenues,
the
third
prong
attaches.
that
is
the
way
the
regulations
construe
it.
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
alan
mansfield
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
large
numbers
and
substantial
business
would
in
fact
be
relevant
factors
under
the
roberts
rationale.
the
court
of
appeals
was
simply
dealing
with
the
issue
of
permissive
factors
and
the
kinds
of
things
that
could
be
looked
at.
again,
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
saying
was
that
a
club
that
meets
the
three
prongs
could
ever
establish
that
it
is
entitled
to
the
exemption.
mr.
alan
mansfield
i
would
say
that
it
might
be.
i
would
say
that
unless
that
club
that
received
the
substantial--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--i
can't
because
it
is
a
fundamentally
misguided
test.
there
is
an
entire
class
of
clubs--
mr.
alan
mansfield
--if
it
is
substantial
enough,
then
that
club
would
not
be
protected
by
rotaries
or
roberts
in
the
first
instance.
the
class
of
clubs
which
are
protected,
which
is
protected
under
the
rotaries
and
roberts
rationale
will
for
all
purposes
have
their
rights
violated
by
the
three
prongs
of
local
law
63.
it
is
very
much
the
same
as
in
schaumburg,
where
there
could
have
been
a
class
of
fraudulent
solicitors,
and
they
would
be
properly
regulated
under
the
law,
but
any
charity
which
was
properly
engaged
in
first
amendment
activity
would
have
its
rights
violated
by
the
75
percent
rule.
the
law
is
also
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution
in
that
it
improperly...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you,
your
honor.
