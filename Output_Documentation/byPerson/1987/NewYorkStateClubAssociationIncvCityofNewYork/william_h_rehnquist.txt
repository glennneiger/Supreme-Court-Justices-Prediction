justice

rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
86-1836,
new
york
state
club
association
versus
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
mansfield,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
area
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
irrebuttable
presumption
you
really
mean
that
the
law
means
what
it
says,
i
guess,
that
when
these
three
factors
are
present
the
law
shall
be
such
and
such.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
laws
like
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
neither
of
those
opinions
purported
to
be
drafting
manuals
for
statutes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
overbreadth
doesn't
apply
here,
then,
as
justice
kennedy
points
out,
under
any
conceivable
circumstances
a
club
in
which
these
three
factors
are
present
would
not
be
subject
to
constitutional
protection.
a
facial
attack
ought
to
fail.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
think
your
irrebuttable
presumption
argument
really
does
you
much
good.
that
just
may
be
my
own
opinion.
it
is
a
law
setting
down
a
standard
and
saying
if
something
meets
this
standard
it
is
subject
to
these
rules.
like
if
you
drive
35
miles
an
hour,
you
are
subject
to
a
reckless
driving
charge.
if
you
drive
75
miles
an
hour,
you
are
not
allowed
to
adduce
evidence
that
you
really
were
driving
carefully.
now,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
a
law
like
that,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mansfield.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
zimroth.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
you
are
really
saying
is
that
this
statute
can
be
applied
certainly
to
some
clubs
that
come
within
its
definition
constitutionally
if
perhaps
it
can't
some
other
clubs,
and
we
will
just
have
to
find
out
as
we
go
along.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
certainly
isn't
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
statute.

of
their
opinion,
they
say,
in
keeping
with
these
objective
and
permissive
factors,
the
law
in
affect
deems
a
club
that
is
large
and
where
much
of
the
activity
central
to
the
maintenance
of
the
association
involves
the
participation
of
strangers
to
that
relationship
to
have
lost
any
claimed
protection
of
intimate
association.
they
don't
give
you
the
impression
that
it
is
going
to
be
a
case
by
case
treatment
under...
once
those
three
factors
are
met.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zimroth.

case

opinion

no.
