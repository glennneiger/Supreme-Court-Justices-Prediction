justice
o'connor
mr.
mansfield,
it
isn't
clear
to
me
from
the
opinion
below
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
that
that
court
necessarily
viewed
the
three
factors
as
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
i
notice
that
is
what
you
are
saying
this
morning
and
in
your
brief.
certainly
your
opponent
in
the
case
says
that
it
doesn't
create
an
irrebuttable
presumption
but
rather
a
presumption
that
then
has
the
effect
of,
i
guess,
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
but
leaving
it
open
to
the
clubs
to
nonetheless
show
by
any
means
that
they
are
indeed
private.
justice
o'connor
in
the
sense
of
creating
a
presumption
so
that
it
shifts
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
club?
justice
o'connor
but
that
is
exactly
what
your
opponent
says
is
not
the
effect
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
opinion.
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
with
that?
do
you
want
us
to
reinterpret
state
law,
local
law?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
zimroth,
is
it
open
to
a
particular
club
in
the
city
of
new
york
faced
with
a
challenge
before
the
human
rights
commission
to
come
in
and
offer
evidence
that
it
believes
demonstrates
the
business
activities
are
not
substantial
even
though
they
would
technically
meet
the
third
prong
of
the
ordinance?
justice
o'connor
does
the
club
have
a
right--
justice
o'connor
--to
have
that
evidence--
justice
o'connor
--considered?
justice
o'connor
would
you
speak
into
the
microphone,
please,
counsel?
justice
o'connor
is
there
a
first
amendment
right
to
discuss
business,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
may
i
ask
about
that
prong
a
little
bit
so
that
i
better
understand
what
the
ordinance
means?
if
a
club
member
brings
a
client,
for
example,
to
the
club
and
buys
a
drink
for
the
client
once
a
week
for
52
weeks,
does
that
make
the
entire
club
a
place
of
public
accommodation
even
if
the
member
bringing
him
is
not
reimbursed,
but
he
is
paying
for
the
drink
for
the
client?
justice
o'connor
the
ordinance
would
make
that--
justice
o'connor
--the
ordinance
as
interpreted
by
the
regulation
would
make
that
club
then
for
all
members
a
place
of
public
accommodation
regardless
of
reimbursement
as
i
understand
it.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
if
the
club
member
buys
the
food
or
beverage
for
the
guest
who
happens
to
be
a
client.
justice
o'connor
it
seems
where
it
said,
yes,
on
behalf
of,
indirectly
on
behalf
of,
and
that
is
what
the
regulation
looked
like.
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course,
that
isn't...
we
are
just
looking
at
a
facial
challenge
and
the
language
of
the
ordinance
and
the
regulation,
and
it
is
a
little
hard
to
know
what
it
means.
