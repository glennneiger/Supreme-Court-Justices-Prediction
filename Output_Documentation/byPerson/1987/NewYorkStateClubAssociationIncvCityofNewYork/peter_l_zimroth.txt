mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
may
it
please
the
court,
if
i
might
just
begin
by
addressing
a
question
that
mr.
justice
white
addressed
to
mr.
mansfield
in
which
i
think
you
asked
whether
or
not
this
law
precludes
on
a
case
by
case
application
the
constitutionality,
that
is,
that
the
court
or
the
administrative
agency
in
new
york
is
precluded
somehow
by
this
statute
from
considering
whether
or
not
the
application
of
the
statute
is
constitutional
or
not.
that
in
fact
is
what
mr.
mansfield
means
by
irrebuttable
presumption.
he
means
that
this
statute
says
to
the
state
administrative
agencies
and
the
state
courts,
you
are
not
allowed
to
look
at
constitutional
considerations.
it
is
really,
frankly,
silly.
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
have
a
specific
statement
in
the
statute
saying
this
is
the
statute,
but
by
the
way,
if
it
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
a
particular
case
you
shouldn't
apply
it.
i
mean,
every--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--if
the--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--absolutely.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
absolutely.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
absolutely,
in
the
context
of
the
club
saying
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
me,
to
my
club.
absolutely.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
you
can't.
you
can't
find
it
in
the
u.s.
code
most
places
either.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that
is
the
end
of
the
statutory
ball
game.
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
constitutional...
how
could
it
be
the
end
of
the
constitutional
ball
game?
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
a
particular
club,
the
city
human
rights
commission
is
bound
not
to
apply
that
statute
to
that
club.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no.
the
last
part
is
correct.
right,
the
last
part
is
correct,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
because
the
last
part
is
correct,
that
every
overbreadth
challenge
fails.
the
overbreadth
challenge
is
in
effect
saying
that
in
most
of
its
applications,
in
most
of
its
applications
this
law
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
mansfield
in
four
years
of
litigation
has
not
come
up
with
one
club
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
apply
it
to.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
you
asked
a
question
about
overbreadth.
one
other
point.
even
though
it
may
not
be
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
i
don't
think
it
needs
to
be
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
i
will
just
cite
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
commission
against
the
dayton
christian
schools.
"even
if
ohio
law
is
such
that
the
commission
may
not
consider
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
which
it
operates,
it
would
seem
an
unusual
doctrine
to
say
that
the
commission
could
not
construe
its
own
statutory
mandate
in
light
of
the
federal
constitutional
principles.
"
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
i
am
saying
that
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
said
nothing
on
the
subject,
they
would
be
open,
the
club
would
be
open
to
make
this
argument.
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
something
and
they
did
construe
the
statute,
and
they
construed
it
in,
contrary
to
what
mr.
mansfield
said,
specifically
in
light
of
his
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
was
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
sure.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
let
me
say
this.
i
think--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--yes,
i
am
going
to
answer.
i
think
that
it
is...
i
can't
think
of
such
a
club,
but
i
am
not
going
to
stand
here
and
say
that
in
the
fertile
imagination
of
man
or
woman,
that
you
can't
think
of
a
hypothetical.
for
example,
you
might
have
an
advocacy
group
that
meets
all
these
criteria.
i
haven't
heard
of
any
such
advocacy
group
in
new
york
city.
i
mean,
we
are
talking
about
clubs
like
the
new
york
athletic
club.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
hard
case,
but
even
if
i
would
assume,
or
even
if
you
would
assume
that
in
that
particular
application
it
would
be
unconstitutional
because
of
the
particular
advocacy
purpose,
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
this
statute?
this
statute
purports
to
regulate
after
a
very
lengthy
hearing
what
really
is
going
on
in
new
york
city.
no
one
brought
to
the
attention
of
either
a
court
or
of
a--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--no,
it
does
not
have
a
duty
to
change.
the
burden
is
on
the
city
human
rights
commission
to
bring
a
proceeding
against
that
club.
it
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
until
that
entire
proceeding
is
adjudicated
both
in
the
human
rights
commission
and
in
the
court.
and
if
at
the
end
of
that
process,
in
which
that
club
will
say,
even
though
hypothetically
my
club
meets
the
standards
because
we
are
an
advocacy
group
and
we
are
small
enough
and
all
of
the
other
standards
that
we
are
constitutionally
protected,
presumably
either
the
human
rights
commission
or
the
state
courts
or
ultimately
this
court
will
say
it
is
right
or
it
is
wrong.
it
is
only
after
that
that
that
club
would
have
to
change
its
practices.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that
is
precisely
right.
i
would
only
amend
that
one
way.
that
is,
i
would
say
that
virtually
every
club
that
you
can
imagine
in
the
city
of
new
york
that
would
come
within
this
statute
would
be
constitutional
application.
i
can't
think
of
a
real
club
in
which
it
wouldn't.
i
mean,
you
can
think
of
hypothetical
clubs,
but
the
city
council
wasn't
talking
about
hypothetical
clubs.
it
was
talking
about
real
clubs.
i
mean,
there
are--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--well,
i
mean,
they
are
talking
about
permissive
factors
there,
and
also
on
the
previous
page,
i
believe
page
9a,
it
says
local
law
63
does
not
prohibit
the
city
factfinder
from
considering
the
test
of
selectivity
or
indeed
any
of
the
power
squadron
factors.
i
would
have
to
concede
that
the
opinion
is
not
crystal
clear
about
that,
but
this
was
after
all
a
facial
attack,
and
what
the
court
had
before
it
is
what
you
have
before
you,
a
statute
that
has
criteria
that
is
directly
related
to
what
this
court
had
previously
said
in
the
jc
case
and
in
the
rotary
case.
it
looked
at
the
city
of
new
york.
it
had
very
extensive
hearings
about
the
nature
of
these
clubs
that
had
very,
very
substantial
business
operations.
the
president
of
the
university
club
estimated
that
more
than
half
of
the
income
from
that
fund
came
from
nonmembers.
we
are
talking
about
clubs
that
have
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
of
income
from
nonmembers,
clubs
that
actually
advertise
to
its
members
saying,
please
use
this
club
more
for
business
purposes.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
think
that's
correct.
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
say,
that
is,
if
you
look
at
the
real
life
in
new
york
city,
it
is
hard
to
think
of
a
real
club
that
would
have
a
constitutional
claim,
that
met
these
three
standards
and
also
had
a
constitutional
claim.
mr.
mansfield
after
four
years
of
litigation
has
not
mentioned
one
such
club.
he
talks
about
it
is
possible
that
the
regulation
or
the
statute
would
be
applied
in
this
way.
it
is
possible
in
that
way.
if
you
look
at
what
the
evidence
was
before
the
city
council
about
the
kind
of
clubs
we
are
talking
about,
we
are
talking
about
large
men's
downtown
business
clubs
that
do
a
substantial
amount
of
business,
but
by
nonmembers.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
i
agree
with
you.
that
is
that
just
because
there
exists...
the
overbreadth
doctrine,
it
seems
to
me,
said
that--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--well,
that's
the
point.
this
would
be--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--it
has
to
be
a
substantial
number
of
them.
that
is,
in
order
for
the
overbreadth
doctrine--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--i
don't
because--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--because--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--there
is
not
a
substantial
number
of
them.
because
the
three
prongs
are
directly
responsive
to
the
constitutional
concerns
that
this
court
laid
down
in
rotary
and
jcs.
you
know--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--that
is,
the
money
has
to
be
received
in
furtherance
of
a
business
purpose.
that
is
why
it
is
very
hard
to
imagine
what
kind
of
club
that
would
be
that
would--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--it
is
in
the
record
before
the
city
council.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
virtually
nothing.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
they
are
the
plaintiffs.
i
mean,
they
refuse
to
put
in
the
record
anything
about
these
125
clubs.
the
reason
is,
i
think,
because
if
you
actually
look
at
the
club,
you
are
going
to
see
that
you
are
talking
about
big
businessmen's
clubs,
not
just
some
sort
of
hypothetical--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--there
is
no
list
in
the
case.
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
and
you
don't
know
how
many
actually
fall
within
the
statute.
you
don't
know
how
many...
you
don't
know
the
selection
procedures
for
each
one.
you
don't
know
whether
or
not
any
of
them
have
an
expressive
purpose.
we
asked
for
this
information
in
interrogatories.
they
just
refused
to
put
it
in.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it
wasn't
our
burden.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
we
asked
for
it
to
try
to
prove
that--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--okay,
we
didn't
try
very
hard.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
but
they
are
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
and
it
seems
to
me
if
they
are
going
to
show
substantial
overbreadth
it
is
their
burden
to
show
that
there
are
real
clubs
out
there
that
could
be
hurt
and
they
haven't.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
there
was
no
such...
there
was
a
claim
made
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
we
had
basically
a
ten-year
history
of
legislative
findings,
began
in
1973,
with
the
city
human
rights
commission
hearings.
there
was
a
report
in
'75.
there
were
hearings
in
'80.
there
were
more
hearings
in
'83.
the
law
passed
in
'84.
what
the
legislature
was
looking
at
is
whether
or
not
there
were
clubs
in
the
city
of
new
york
that
really
served
a
business
function
and
the
exclusion
of
women
and
minorities
really
had
a
very
negative
impact
on
the
economic
lives
of
those
excluded.
there
wasn't
any
evidence
for
that
entire
ten-year
period
that
that
same
function
was
relevant
when
you
deal
with
organizations
like...
you
mentioned
some;
i
will
mention
some
others...
the
supreme
council
of
the
mystic
order
of
the
veiled
prophets
of
the
enchanged
realm,
or
a
local
camp
of
the
modern
woodsmen
of
america.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
the
same
standards
would
apply
if
you
are
talking
about
depriving
people
of
liberty,
where
you
are
talking
about
a
fundamental
right.
i
am
just...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
the
answer
but
i
do
see
a
serious
distinction
here.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
the
rational
basis
is
that...
it
seems
to
me
it
is
appropriate
for
the
legislature
after
it
goes
to
a
hearing
to
legislate
about
what
the
problem
is.
you
know,
there
are
other...
i
mean,
you
are
talking
also
about
religious
corporations
that
were
excluded
as
well.
you
know,
one
might
at
least
rationally
think
that
to
get
into
the
area
of
religious
organizations,
maybe
even
fraternal
organizations
that
are
explicitly
by
statute
supposed
to
be
entirely
for
the
benefit
of
the
people,
not
for
outsiders,
that
you
might
think
that
that
was
getting
closer
to
constitutional
concerns.
why
do
you
want
to
force
the
city
of
new
york
to
legislate
about
those
possibly
more
difficult
areas
when
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
presented
the
same
problem?
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
any
evidence
of
that.
there
is
one
other
point
i
wanted
to
say
about
the
elks
and
so
forth.
we
are
talking
about
local
legislation.
i
have
no
idea
what
function
the
elks
or
the
moose
or
these
various
organizations
may
play
in
other
cities,
in
other
settings,
in
rural
america,
and
so
forth.
the
point
is
that
in
the
city
of
new
york
there
just
was
no
evidence
that
there
was
a
problem
like
this,
and
that's
the
answer.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
we
are
not
putting
them
in
jail
either.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
could...
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
said
the
reason
the
american
legion
is
exempt
is
that
in
the
city
of
new
york
there
was
no
evidence
that
came
forth
from
the
city
council
that
presented
the
same
kind
of
problem.
maybe
it
is
a
similar
problem--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--maybe
it
is
a
similar
problem
somewhere
else
in
the
country.
it
was
not
in
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
only
if
you
find
that
the
clubs
that
are
included
have
a
first
amendment
right
which
really
begs
the
question.
in
other
words,
if
the
clubs
that
are
included
have
a
first
amendment
right,
you
never
have
to
reach
the
equal
protection
argument,
and
if
they
don't,
then
the
only
thing
that
the
cases
say
that
you
are
to
look
to
is
the
rational
basis
test,
and
i
think
it
is
a
rational
basis
that
the
city
council
simply
had
ten
years
of
history
behind
it
and
it
was
no
problem
in
this
area.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
am
sorry,
i
am
having--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--well,
there
are
no
speech
classifications
in
this
statute.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
only
if
you
find
that
the
clubs
that
are
included
in
this
statute
have
a
first
amendment
right.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
in
some
circumstances,
either
if
the
association
is
intimate
or
if
it
has
a
predominantly
expressive
purpose.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
that
is
why
it
picked
the
standard
of
400
members.
that
is
a
number
not
incidentally
which
this
court
characterized
as
large
in
the
rotary
case.
that
was
the
language
of
this
court.
there
was
a
local
club
in
rotary
which
had,
i
think,
400
members,
and
it
characterized
it
as
large.
and
that
is
why
it
had
a
standard
that
not
only
did
it
have
to
be
large
but
it
had
to
accept
on
a
regular
basis
fees
or
other
money
on
or
behalf
of
nonmembers
in
furtherance
of
a
business
purpose,
not
simply
money
for
nonmembers,
nonmembers
in
furtherance
of
a
business
purpose.
and
when
you
add
all
that
together,
i
think
it
is
pretty
hard
to
say
that
these
clubs
have,
at
least
as
far
as
right
of
intimate
expression,
i
mean,
at
last
count
the
new
york
athletic
club
had
10,003
members.
i
mean,
can
you
imagine
someone
getting
up
in
here
and
saying,
here
are
10,002
of
my
most
intimate
friends?
it
is
just
not
a
credible
kind
of
argument.
so--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--if
there
is
it
is
commercial
seed
and
it
is
much
lesser
protected.
we
are
not
prohibiting
people
from
discussing
business
here.
i
mean,
that
is
one
thing
that
has
to
be
said
about
this
statute.
this
statute
doesn't
prohibit
small
groups
of
people
or
even
large
groups
of
people
from
getting
together
and
excluding
whomever
they
want.
it
says,
however,
that
you
can't
do
that
under
the
rationale
that
this
club
is
an
extension
of
your
living
room
and
in
fact
have
it
be
an
extension
of
your
business.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
i
don't
know.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
there
is
no
evidence...
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
that
kind
of
thing
happens
in
those
kinds
of
clubs
in
the
city
of
new
york,
the
point
being
that
these
clubs
can
simply,
they
can
get
out
of
this
regulation
altogether.
they
just
have
to
stop
taking
money
on
behalf
of
nonmembers
in
furtherance
of
business.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
theoretically
but
not
practically.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
not
the
ordinance,
the
regulation,
which
has
not
been
applied
or
tested.
the
ordinance
simply--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--i'm
sorry.
regardless
of
reimbursement?
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
no,
i'm
sorry,
then
maybe
you
can--
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
--i
don't
think
regardless
of
reimbursement.
i
suppose
it
is
possible
to
interpret
on
behalf
of.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
it
is
possible
to
interpret
it
that
way.
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
if
we
ever
had
a
case
like
that
it
would
be
interpreted
that
way,
but
it
is
possible.
shall
i
tell
you
how
in
fact
that
has
been
interpreted?
i
mean,
it
hasn't
been
interpreted
by
a
court
yet
because
this
is
a
pre-enforcement
action,
but
we
are
in
litigation
now
with
the
union
league
club.
the
union
league
club
is
required
as
many
of
these
clubs
are
required
to
keep
tax
records
for
functions
where
eight
or
more
nonmembers
attend,
and
so
we
subpoenaed
those
records,
and
they
show
close,
like
from
one
year,
1986,
close
to
100
separate
functions
where
you
are
not
talking
about
one
drink,
you
are
talking
about
three
for
450
people.
those
are
counted
as
one
instance,
not
450
instances,
one
instance,
and
you
are
talking
about
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars.
mr.
peter
l.
zimroth
well,
which
is
really
why
i
think
a
facial
challenge
is
completely
inappropriate
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
you
need
to
have
real
cases
with
a
real
record
where
you
know
what
the
club
is,
where
you
know
exactly
how
the
administrative
agency
has
interpreted
the
regulation
and
how
a
court
has
applied
it,
and
when
you
have
that
record
before
you
then
you
will
have
a
real
case.
i
don't
think
this
is
a
real
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
