justice
stevens
mr.
mansfield,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
group
that
your
client
represents?
in
the
naacp
case
on
which
you
rely
heavily,
justice
harlan
points
out
the
importance
of
the
freedom
to
engage
in
association
for
the
advancement
of
beliefs
and
ideas,
which
seems
to
me
may
be
a
concept
somewhat
different
from
merely
a
social
organization
that
is
purely
social.
does
the
record
tell
us
how
many
of
the
members
of
the
association
are
engaged
in
the
advancement
of
some
kind
of
ideas
of
a
political
type
as
opposed
to
merely
a
social
organization?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
the
same
standard
applies
to
that
kind
of
a
first
amendment
claim
as
one...
as
the
standard
applies
in
the
naacp
context?
justice
stevens
you
think
there
is
the
same...
there
is
an
equal
importance
in
protecting
that
kind
of
association?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
would
you
not
agree
that
the
size
factor
is
quite
different
in
the
political
context
than
in
the
intimate
association
context?
you
couldn't
claim
the
same
right
of
intimate
association
for
100,000
people
that
you
could
for
a
political
group.
justice
stevens
and
your
position
is,
400
is,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
it
has
got
to
be
bigger
than
that.
at
what
line
would
you
say
that
the
number
would
be
such
that
there
would
no
longer
be
the
right
of
intimate
association?
justice
stevens
your
position
is,
there
can
be
no
flat
guideline?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
would
make
the
same
argument
about
the
new
york
statute
if
one
of
the
prongs
instead
of
a
substantial
amount
of
business
activity
said,
and
100
percent
of
the
members
regularly,
that
is,
at
least
once
a
week
or
once
a
month,
transact
some
kind
of
business
in
this
place.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
would
also
be
invalid,
though,
do
you?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
well,
maybe
the
reason
is
that
businessmen
like
to
do
business
with
men.
is
that
a
sufficient
reason?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
that
is
very
different,
because
here
you
have
construed
your
own
statute,
and
if
i
understand
your
argument
now,
you
are
saying,
well,
maybe
it
is
unconstitutional
as
to
some
of
these
clubs,
but
they
can
raise
that
in
due
course.
that
is
just
too
bad.
justice
stevens
let
me
interrupt
you
again
if
i
may,
please.
justice
stevens
do
you
agree
that
if
these
three
prongs
of
this
test
are
met,
i
don't
care
whether
it
is
irrebuttable
or
not,
assume
that
those
are
met,
could
they
be
met
and
could
a
club
still
have
a
constitutional
right
to
deny
membership
to
a
minority
group?
justice
stevens
it
is
a
simple
question.
justice
stevens
well,
i
can
give
you
a
hypothetical.
supposing
the
society
of
divorced
men,
who
think
they
are
discriminated
against
in
the
administration
of
the
domestic
relations
laws,
formed
a
group
of
450
and
they
regularly
met,
they
had
some
people
who
paid
their
bills,
they
did
some
business,
and
all
the
rest.
could
the
law
be
applied
to
them?
and
they
thought
it
would
further
their
purpose
to
exclude
women
from
their
organization.
justice
stevens
what
is
such
a
club
supposed
to
do
in
its
day
to
day
operations
if
they
see
this
statute,
they
say
we
understand
the
city
is
going
to
prosecute
everybody
that
violates
it,
we
are
in
violation.
should
it
change?
does
it
have
a
duty
to
change?
justice
stevens
mr.
zimroth,
you
referred
to
the
university
club,
i
guess
it
was,
that
over
half
of
its
members
are
engaged
in
business.
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
stevens
well,
what
is
in
the
record
in
this
lawsuit?
is
there
anything
about
any
of
these
clubs?
justice
stevens
why
not?
justice
stevens
do
we
even
have
a
list
of
the
members
of
this
organization?
justice
stevens
do
we
know
how
many
of
them
are
in
new
york
city?
justice
stevens
do
we
know
how
many
of
the
125
are--
justice
stevens
--yes.
well,
you
certainly
could
have
gotten
that
information.
justice
stevens
well,
if
you
asked
for
it
you
sort
of
assumed
a
little
burden.
justice
stevens
well,
if
you
didn't
get
answers
you
didn't
try
very
hard.
