justice
scalia
i
wondered
why
he
conceded
that.
and
you
know
why
i
think
he
conceded
it,
mr.
homer,
is
that
if
he
didn't,
he
thought
he
would
be
met
with
the
argument
that
there
is
a
great
loss
for
the
hospital
if
it
challenges
the
regulation
and
does
not
follow
the
regulation
in
the
report.
that
is,
if
you
read
139500(a)(1)(b)
and
(c).
if
it's
not
following
the
regulations,
it
cannot
appeal
when
the
provider
simply
sits
on
the
submission.
justice
scalia
and
takes
no
action
at
all.
justice
scalia
that's
a
big
loss.
justice
scalia
in
order
to
give
you
a
way
of
avoiding
1(b)
and
(c).
justice
scalia
right.
i
understand.
justice
scalia
give
him
credit,
at
least.
he
does
assert
ambiguity.
now,
you
may
not
agree
with
it.
he
says
the
word,
dissatisfied,
is
the
peg.
justice
scalia
he
is
arguing
it
is
clear
in
his
direction,
which
is
even
better
than
ambiguous,
right?
you're
not
going
to
criticize
him
for
that?
justice
scalia
mr.
pincus,
most
administrative
remedies
can
give
you
relief.
i
mean,
the
very
term,
exhaust
administrative
remedies,
it
means
there's
some
administrator
who
can
provide
you
relief.
but
here
the
intermediary
cannot
provide
you
relief,
so
how
can
you
possibly
call
that
an
administrative
remedy.
the
administrator
has
to
follow
the
regulation.
justice
scalia
mr.
pincus,
why
can
we
treat
these
regulation
cases
differently
from
the
other
ones
that
you
say
are
lurking
there
in
the
wings
to
pounce
upon
us
if
we
come
out
this
way
on
regulation?
i
mean,
certainly
the
statute
treats
regulations
differently.
in
(a)(1)(b)
and
(c),
it
does
make
a
special
provision.
that
is,
you
can't
appeal
unless
you
can
appeal
when
you
don't
receive
a
final
determination
from
the
intermediary,
except
that
you
can't
appeal
if
you
haven't
filed
your
report
in
accordance
with
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
secretary.
now,
the
statute
treats
that
kind
of
an
issue
quite
differently
from
other
issues.
justice
scalia
there's
nothing
unclear
about
being
dissatisfied.
i've
gotten
a
decision
and
i'm
dissatisfied
with
it.
it
doesn't
seem
unclear
to
me.
justice
scalia
i
would
look
on
it
as
you're
dissatisfied
with
the
fact
that
the
provider
gave
you
all
the
provider
could
possibly
have
given
you.
why
should
you
be
dissatisfied
with
yourself.
it
would
have
been
no
use
asking
him
for
more
anyway,
because
he
couldn't
give
you
more.
he
had
to
follow
the
regulation.
you're
dissatisfied
with
the
fact
that
he
had
to
follow
the
regulation.
justice
scalia
mr.
pincus,
what
about
this
to
solve
that
problem
you're
worried
about
where
somebody
doesn't
ask
for
relief
which
the
provider
could
have
given,
and
he's
still
dissatisfied.
i
agree
it
would
cover
that
situation.
but
all
that
would
show
is
that
there
is
jurisdiction
to
take
the
appeal
and
to
go
to
the
review
board.
it
doesn't
show
that
the
review
board
has
to
entertain
the
claim.
couldn't
the
review
board
do
what
courts
of
appeals
do
when
they
refuse
to
hear
an
issue
that
was
not
raised
below
where
it
could
have
been
acted
upon
below.
they
don't
say
they
have
no
jurisdiction.
they
just
say,
this
point
wasn't
raised
below.
we're
not
going
to
listen
to
it.
why
wouldn't
that
meet
all
of
the
secretary's
desires
about
these
other
cases
lurking
in
the
wings?
justice
scalia
for
a
different
purpose.
justice
scalia
i
do.
i
do
just
have
one
additional
question.
on
the
alternative
basis
that
the
government
urges,
why
isn't
it
the
case
that
the
government
can
acknowledge
that
there
was
jurisdiction
to
appear
before
the
board,
but
simply
say,
we
accepted
jurisdiction
and
as
a
matter
of
sound
practice
we
are
simply
not
going
to
allow
a
claim
that
you
didn't
raise
at
the
first
step.
what's
the
matter
with
that?
that
doesn't
get
you
into
the
language
of
the
statute
at
all.
