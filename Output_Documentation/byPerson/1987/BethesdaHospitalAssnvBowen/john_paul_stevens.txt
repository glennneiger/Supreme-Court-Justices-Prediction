justice
stevens
but
mr.
pincus,
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
point
that
there
was
no
administrative
remedy?
is
that
not
correct
in
the
facts
of
this
case?
justice
stevens
that's
a
yes
or
no,
i
think.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
it
true
that
in
ringer
there
was
an
express
requirement
the
statute
spelled
out
what
had
to
be
exhausted
before
you
could
get
judicial
review.
you
don't
have
that
here.
it's
a
rather
different
statute.
justice
stevens
what
about
the
first
claim
filed
before
all
this
development
took
place,
i
mean,
just
relying
on
the
statute
as
it
was
written
and
the
regulations
which
say
fill
out
the
form
in
accordance
with
regulations.
how
could
a
lawyer
know
what
was
going
to
hit
them,
what
it's
going
to
be
hit
with
until
you
get
these
later--
justice
stevens
--somebody's
got
to
go
first,
you
know.
justice
stevens
you
rely
on
the
word,
dissatisfied,
that
they
really
were
not
dissatisfied
because
they
didn't
tell
you
in
advance?
justice
stevens
the
(f)(1)
which
gives
him
an
additional
remedy
but
doesn't
say
anything
about
what
happens
at
the
administrative
review.
justice
stevens
but
apart
from
(f)(1),
all
you've
got
is
the
word,
dissatisfied,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
designed
to
review
a
lot
of
audits
and
facts
and
figures
but
not
the
validity
of
the
regulations.
justice
stevens
determinations
that
intermediaries
have
authority
to
make,
not
review
determinations
they
don't
have
authority
to
make.
and
they
didn't
have
the
authority
to
make
the
determination
at
issue
here.
justice
stevens
i
don't
agree
with
you
at
all.
we
should
decide
the
case
in
front
of
us.
maybe
there
are
a
lot
of
other
tough
cases
out
there
but
this
one
doesn't
look
very
hard.
justice
stevens
if
the
statute
says
you
must
exhaust.
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
justice
stevens
am
i
correct
that
you
would
substitute
for
the
word,
dissatisfied,
you
say
what
the
statute
really
means
is
every
time
the
provider
receives
less
than
the
amount
claimed
in
the
cost
report
filed
in
accordance
with
the
regulations.
but
you
know,
even
if
you
change
the
statute
that
way,
he
wouldn't
recover
if
he
had
to
file
a
supplemental
letter.
i
don't
know
how
you
substitute--
justice
stevens
--when
did
the
secretary
first
make
it
known
publicly
that
a
side
cover
letter
of
that
kind
must
be
made
in
order
to
preserve
the
rights
such
as
at
stake
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
but
the
rule
was
just
developed
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
there
was
no
regulation
that
spelled
it
out
in
advance?
justice
stevens
and
when
was
that
issued?
justice
stevens
1981.
