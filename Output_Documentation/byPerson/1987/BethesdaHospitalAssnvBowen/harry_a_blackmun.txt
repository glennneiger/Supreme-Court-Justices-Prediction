justice
blackmun
mr.
homer,
is
there
any
analogy
that
would
favor
your
side
in
the
income
tax
field?
one
can
file
an
income
tax
return
and
make
mistakes
in
it,
or
he
can
file
it
in
accordance
with
prevailing
regulations
later
declared
invalid
and
still
come
back
with
a
claim
for
a
refund,
may
he
not?
justice
blackmun
i
know
what
the
secretary's
position
is
here.
what
i'm
asking
is
there
an
analogy
in
the
income
tax
field?
justice
blackmun
i'm
trying
to
give
you
one
and
you
don't
grasp
the
bait.
justice
blackmun
i
think
so,
too.
justice
blackmun
has
the
secretary
been
consistent
in
the
past?
justice
blackmun
the
amicus
says
he
hasn't
been.
justice
blackmun
mr.
pincus,
if
you
prevail
here,
will
you
do
so
on
a
regulation
that
has
been
declared
illegal?
justice
blackmun
so
far
as
the
case
being
so
open
and
shut,
certainly
the
panel
below
didn't
think
it
was,
did
it?
justice
blackmun
the
other
way.
justice
blackmun
the
other
way,
if
it
hadn't
been
bound
by
a
prior
sixth
circuit
case.
