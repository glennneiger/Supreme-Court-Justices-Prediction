were
you
aware
that
that
was
an
option?
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
you
know
you're
not
going
to
get
more
than
you
ask
for.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
pincus,
do
you
think
if
all
that
was
done
here
was
to
attach
a
cover
letter,
that
the
cost
report
filing
was
just
as
it
was,
but
a
little
cover
letter
were
attached,
that
the
intermediary
would
then
go
into
the
merits
of
that
and
try
to
figure
out
some
way
to
adjust
the
amounts
allowable
to
take
account
of
it?
justice
o'connor
i
mean
it
sounds
like
the
cover
letter
the
intermediary
isn't
concerned
with
looking
at
it
at
all.
justice
o'connor
was
there--
justice
o'connor
--was
there
ever
an
express
regulation
explaining
that
providers
could
file
such
a
cover
letter
and
it
would
suffice?
