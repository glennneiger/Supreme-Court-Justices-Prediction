mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
despite
petitioners'
attempts
to
depict
this
case
as
one
that
turns
on
the
procedural
peculiarities
of
the
medicare
reimbursement
system,
we
think
that
the
issue
of
statutory
interpretation
that's
presented
here
is
neither
novel
nor
complex.
it's
an
issue
that
arises
with
some
frequency
in
administrative
law,
which
is
whether
claimant
must
exhaust
its
administrative
remedies
in
order
to
preserve
its
claim
for
further
review.
now,
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
have
held
in
a
variety
of
contexts
that
where
congress
has
established
a
multi-tiered
administrative
process,
a
party
must
exhaust
its
administrative
remedies
in
order
to
obtain
further
review
of
its
claim.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
there
are
two
questions
presented
in
this
case,
and
we
rely
by
analogy
the
way
the
court
has
interpreted
other
exhaustion
requirements
under
other
parts
of
the
social
security
laws
in
cases
like
southland
and
ringer.
in
those
cases,
the
court
has
really
applied
a
two
step
process.
the
court
has
first
looked
to
see
whether
there
is
a
general
exhaustion
requirement
in
a
run
of
the
mill
case,
a
case
in
which
the
administrator
can
grant
relief.
and
then
it's
looked
to
see
whether
the
facts
of
the
case
before
it
in
which
the
claimant
is
typically
urging
that
exhaustion
is
not
necessary
merit
an
exception
from
that
general
principle.
and
we
think
that's
the
proper
way
to
analyze
this
case.
petitioners
focus
on
the
fact
that
this
case
involves
a
reimbursement
claim
that
rests
on
a
challenge
to
a
regulation.
but
it's
still
a
reimbursement
claim,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
raising
this
same
issue
in
which
there
wasn't
a
challenge
to
a
regulation.
some
of
those
cases
are
now
pending
before
the
court
on
certiorari.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
on
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
i
think
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
intermediary
could
not
award
the
relief
that
they
sought.
but
in
ringer
the
court
specifically
said
that
exhaustion
may
be
required
in
a
case
where
it
appears
to
be
futile.
for
example,
it
may
be
that
a
provider
frames
its
claim
for
reimbursement,
the
provider
thinks
that
it
depends
on
the
invalidation
of
the
regulation.
upon
examination
of
the
claim,
it
may
turn
out
that
reimbursement
can
be
rewarded
because
the
provider
is
under
a
misapprehension
about
the
scope
of
the
regulation,
or
because
the
reimbursement
can
be
awarded
under
some
other
theory,
or
it
may
turn
out
that
the
claim
is
barred
for
some
reason
that
the
provider
didn't
recognize
and
so
the
challenge
to
the
regulation
is
moot.
and
the
court
recognized
in
ringer
that
it
is
appropriate
to
have
an
administrative
entity
that
can't
rule
on
the
precise
claim
look
at
those
issues
to
apply
its
expertise
to
make
sure
that
what
is
in-fact
presented
is
a
challenge
to
the
statute
that
the
administrative
entity
can't
resolve.
and
i
think
those
rationales
are
equally
applicable
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
language
has
anything
to
do
with
a
substantive
claim.
we
think
the
rules
and
regulations
that
those
provisions
are
talking
about
are
the
rules
and
regulations
dealing
with
the
form
and
procedural
requirements
in
preparing
a
cost
report.
we
don't
think
it's
a
coincidence
that
this
point
is
not
discussed
in
the
briefs
or
any
of
the
appellate
decisions
raising
the
issue
because
we
think
it
is
simply
a
non...
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
substantive
disagreement
about
the
cost
rules.
it
has
to
do
with
the
procedural
rules.
and
if
a
provider
files
a
cost
report
applying
a
substantive
cost
rule
or
not
following
a
substantive
cost
rule,
we
don't
think
that
that
provision
applies
and
to
our
knowledge
it
hasn't
ever
been
applied
to
throw
out
a
cost
report.
and
let
me
just
go
back
to
your
question
about
why
there
should
not
be
a
difference
for
claims
based
on
challenges
to
regulations.
in
addition
to
the
reasons
that
i've
already
given,
which
is
that
in
many
cases
what
a
provider
thinks
to
be
a
challenge
to
a
regulation
may
not
be,
we
don't
think
there's
any
basis
in
the
statute
for
making
that
distinction.
and
especially
we
look
to
subsection
(f)(1)
which
is
where
congress
created
an
expedited
judicial
review
remedy
to
deal
specifically
with
cases
resting
on
challenges
to
regulations.
and
what
congress
did--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--that
is
on
page
3...
the
relevant
language
is
on
page
3(a)
of
our
brief.
prior
to
the
amendment
in
1980
that
added
the
language
to
which
i'm
about
to
refer,
all
claims
had
to
be
brought
to
the
prrb
and
had
to
go
through
a
formal
hearing
before
the
prrb,
even
challenges
to
regulations
which
the
prrb
cannot
award
relief
on.
like
the
intermediary,
the
prrb
is
bound
by
the
secretary's
regulation.
nonetheless,
prior
to
the
addition
of
this
language,
a
provider
that
was
challenging
a
regulation
had
to
bring
that
reimbursement
claim
before
the
prrb,
had
to
have
it
heard
by
the
prrb--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
let
me...
the
language
on
which
we
rely
is
excerpted
maybe
a
little
more
clearly
on
the
top
of
page
15
of
our
brief.
what
congress
did
was
add
a
provision
that
allowed
a
provider
to
bypass
a
board
hearing
in
these
cases.
it
said,
providers
shall
have
the
right
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
any
action
of
the
fiscal
intermediary
which
involves
a
question
of
law
or
regulations
relevant
to
the
matters
in
controversy
whenever
the
board
determines
that
it
is
without
authority
to
decide
the
question.
and
we
think
what
congress
did
here
very
specifically
was
to
say,
there
has
to
be
an
action
of
the
fiscal
intermediary.
that's
the
peg
for
getting
expedited
judicial
review.
if
you've
got
that,
if
you've
raised
this
claim
before
the
intermediary
and
it's
been
rejected,
then
you
can
go
before
the
board.
and
if
the
board
decides
that
in
fact
your
claim
does
rest
on
a
challenge
to
regulations,
then
the
board
can
in
effect
certify
your
question
for
immediate
judicial
review.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
the
secretary
has
very
substantial
reasons
for
wanting
this
to
happen.
the
court
has
recognized
in
a
variety
of
cases
that
the
exhaustion
doctrine
rests
upon
a
number
of
important
policies,
primarily
the
policy
of
administrative
efficiency.
and
this
is
a
very
large
administrative
system.
there
are
15,000--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
as
i
said,
there
are
two
categories
of
claims.
there
are
claims
that
are
not
useless
because
they
are
claims
for
which
relief
can
be
granted
by
the
intermediary,
and
then
there
are
claims
which
the
provider
might
think
can
only
be
granted
by
a
court.
but
as
to
the
first
class
of
claims,
we
think
it's
self-evident
that
there
is
great
efficiency
in
having
claims
that
the
intermediary
may
grant
raised
before
the
intermediary.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
type
of
claim
that's
involved
in
this
case
we
think
there
are
also
the
important
reasons
that
the
court
has
recognized
in
ringer,
which
are
while
the
provider
might
think
that
the
only
way
it
can
get
relief
is
if
the
regulation
is
overturned,
it
might
be
that
the
provider
is
wrong
about
what
the
regulation
means,
and
that
if
the
claim
had
been
raised
before
the
intermediary,
the
intermediary
would
have
interpreted
the
regulation
to
award
relief.
now,
this
regulation--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
in
the
dissatisfaction
language
of
subsection
(a)(1)
and
in
the
language
that
i've
just
referred
to
in
the
expedited
judicial
review
provision,
congress
has
made
clear
that
there
is
a
similar
exhaustion
requirement
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
think
it's
clear,
but
if
the
court
thinks
it's
ambiguous,
we
think
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
certainly
reasonable
and
that
the
court
should
adopt
it.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
in
our
view,
the
secretary
has
consistently--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
and
we
explain
in
our
brief
in
some
detail
the
argument
on
pages
35
and
36
of
our
brief,
we
respond
to
the
argument
that
there
has
been
some
inconsistency.
the
secretary
has
always
required
that
in
order
to
invoke
the
board's
jurisdiction,
the
provider
is
only
entitled
to
invoke
the
board's
jurisdiction
on
a
claim
that
it
raised
before
the
intermediary.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
think
that
the
claim
might
go
away,
either
because
he's
entitled
to
relief
on
some
other
basis
or
for
some
other--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
we
think
that
the
intermediaries
are
obligated
to
look
at
the
claims
and
they
do.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
the
intermediary
certainly
could
say
that
even
under
the
theory
advanced
by
the
provider
that
the
claim
is
wrong.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
the
secretary
believes
that
part
of
the
intermediary's
obligations
are
to
look
at
things
in
cover
letters
and
to
do
the
kind
of
evaluation
to
which
i've
just
referred.
we
don't
think
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we
think
the
cover
letter
option
is
really
for
the
convenience
of
the
provider
more
than
anything
else.
it's--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--this
rule
has
evolved
through
cost
reimbursement
decisions
of
the
board
which
are
reviewed
by
the
administrator
of
the
health
care
financing
administration.
and
those
decisions
are
reported
in
a
widely
distributed
reporter
that
is
certainly
something
with
which
members
of
the
industry
are
well
informed.
we
think
it's
important
to
realize
in
this
case
that
this
is
not
similar
to
for
example
the
disability
area
where
the
claimants
are
individuals
that
might
be
poor
and
not
well
counseled.
the
providers
in
this
case
are
large
health
care
institutions
that
have
staffs
devoted
to
complying
with
medicare
regulations,
have
trade
organizations
that
publicize
recent
decisions
and
make
sure
their
members
are
aware
of
what
the
rules
are
and
to
which
the
members
can
go
if
they
want
assistance
in
finding
out
what
the
regulations
are.
we
think
when
the
secretary
issued
decisions
embodying
this
regulation
and
let
me
add
that
the
rule
was
subsequently
codified
in
a
manual
that
is
distributed
to
all
providers,
we
think
that's
enough
to
inform
this
class
of
claimants
about--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
those...
it
might
be--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it
might
be
a
different
case.
we
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
statute
and
the
regulations--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we
rely
on
the
word,
dissatisfied.
we
rely
on
the
language
of
the
judicial
review
provision.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
we
think
that,
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we
also
have
the
fact
that
this
was
called
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board
and
it
was
designed
to
review
something,
not
to
make
decisions.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
it
does
not
review
the
regulations
but
what
it
does
review
is
review
intermediary
determinations.
we
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
again,
i
think
it's
a
mistake
to
concentrate
on
the
particular
narrow
question
involved
here.
again,
the
board
itself--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
principles
that
the
court
has
applied
in
the
other
social
security
contexts
indicate
that
even
where
the
court
has
held
that
even
where
the
particular
decisionmaker
does
not
have
the
authority
to
decide
the
claim,
exhaustion
may
be
appropriate.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
those
statutes,
your
honor,
those
statutes,
the
statute
there
referred
to
a
final
decision.
it
did
not
expressly
lay
out
a
detailed
exhaustion
plan,
and
the
court
found
that
what
final
decision
meant
was
a
particular
exhaustion
requirement.
and
we
think
here
what
dissatisfied
means
as
interpreted
in
the
context
of
the
statute
is
a
similar
exhaustion
requirement.
let
me
add
that
these
terms
are
illuminated
we
think
very
significantly
by
the
legislative
history.
when
the
medicare
program
was
first
adopted,
the
only
entity
that
looked
at
a
cost
report
was
the
intermediary.
there
was
no
board.
there
was
no
further
review.
the
provider
filed
its
cost
report,
the
intermediary
made
the
determinations,
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
unless
the
secretary
chose
to
review
the
determination
which
did
not
happen
very
frequently.
in
turn,
the
providers
were
very
dissatisfied
with
the
state
of
affairs
because
they
had
no
way
to
challenge
the
decisions
of
intermediaries
which
they
were
unhappy
with.
and
they--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
nothing
about
the
exhaustion
requirement
has
been
declared
illegal,
your
honor.
and
some
courts
have
concluded
that
the
substantive
rule
here,
the
medicare
malpractice
insurance
reimbursement
rule,
has
been
declared
unlawful.
but
we
don't
think
the
substantive
claim
should
influence
the
court's
determination
of
this
important
procedural
question.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
the
panel
indicated
that
perhaps
it
might
come
out--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
other
way.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
the
prior
panel
came
out
our
way
and
a
number
of
other
courts
of
appeals
have
come
out
our
way,
and
we
think
that
this
is
a
very
appropriate
case
if
this
court
or
other
courts
have
felt
that
the
statutory
language
is
ambiguous,
this
is
a
textbook
case
for
deference
to
the
agency.
this
is
the
administrative
scheme
that
the
secretary
oversees
and
we
think
that
the
secretary
has
expertise
in
deciding
what
congress
intended
in
order
to
have
a
properly
functioning
process.
and
so
we
think
even
if
the
statutory
language
is
less
than
clear,
it
is
an
appropriate
case
for
deference,
and
we
think
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
imminently
reasonable.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
the
language
is
dissatisfied
with
a
final
determination
of
the...
and
i'll
skip
a
few
words...
fiscal
intermediary...
and
i'll
skip
a
few
more
words...
as
to
the
amount
of
total
program
reimbursement
due
the
provider.
and
we
think
as
three
courts
of
appeals
have
concluded
that
what
that
language
means
is
that
a
provider
can
be
dissatisfied
when
the
intermediary
doesn't
award
something
that
the
provider
wanted.
that's
when
you're
dissatisfied
with
the
intermediary's
determination.
otherwise,
you're
dissatisfied
with
yourself
because
you
didn't
ask
for
enough.
you
got
everything
you
wanted.
you
should
have
asked
for
more.
you're
not
dissatisfied
with
what
the
decisionmaker
did;
you're
dissatisfied
with
your
own
request.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
that's
looking
at
the
statutory
language.
again,
i
know
justice
stevens
will
disagree,
but
the
only
context
in
which
this
issue
can
arise
is
not
the
regulation
context.
and
i
think
it
is
certainly
clear
that
in
the
run
of
the
mill
case
where
the
intermediary
could
grant
relief,
there
is
ample
reason
to
be
dissatisfied.
and
we
think
that
the
general
meeting
that
the
language
should
not
be
interpreted
simply
by
focusing
on
this
provision
but
should
be
looked
at
generally
and
generally
if
you
don't
ask
for
it,
you
shouldn't
be
dissatisfied
if
you
didn't
get
it.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
we
make
that
argument
in
our
brief
as
an
alternative
argument
and
we
certainly
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--that's
a
possibility
if
the
court
disagrees
with
our
principal
submission.
but
we
think
that
there's
no
reason
why
the
board's
authority
to
decide
to
do
that
would
be
limited
to
the
non-regulation
cases.
the
board
could
well
determine
we
think
that
the
policies
that
i've
been
discussing
that
also
apply
in
a
situation
where
the
intermediary
might
not
have
authority
to
decide
the
claim
on
the
ground
that
the
provider
is
asserting,
also
warrant
an
across
the
board
rule.
and
we
think
that
the
board
or
the
secretary
should
have
the
authority
to
decide
the
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
think
the
supplemental
level
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
claiming
the
amount
in
the
cost
report.
we
think
it's
sort
of
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
another.
the
supplemental
letter
states
a
claim
for
additional
reimbursement
and
it
is
attached
to
the
cost
report.
so
we
think
that
this
argument
that
the
cover
letter
somehow
blows
our
case
out
of
the
water
is
just
a
red
herring.
it
is
the
same
thing,
and
it's
just
designed
to
make
things
a
little
easier
for
the
provider.
but
we
think
it
is
important
because
it
serves
the
exact
same
function
of
alerting
the
intermediary--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
first
reported
case
that
we
were
able
to
find
we
discuss
in
a
footnote
on
page
34
our
brief.
we
list
a
number
of
the
board
and
administrative
decisions
embodying
this
requirement
and
the
first
one
that
we
list
was
in
1977.
and
that
decision
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
decision
expressly
gave...
that
decision
i
think
referred
to
claiming
the
cost,
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
expressly
defined
the
options.
in
subsequent
decisions,
the
rule
has
been
clarified.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
was
developed
on...
it
is
now
spelled
out
in
a
provision
in
the
manual
that
the
secretary
issues
to
guide
providers
in
filling
out
cost
reports.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
that
was
issued
in
july,
1981.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
current
version
which
makes
everything
clear.
let
me
turn
back
to
the
legislative
history
for
a
moment
because
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
really
illuminates
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
when
it
created
the
prrb.
as
i
was
saying,
the
board
was
created
in
response
to
complaints
of
providers
who
were
dissatisfied
with
their
intermediaries
determinations,
and
more
particularly
dissatisfied
with
the
fact
that
they
had
no
where
to
contest
the
determinations
that
intermediaries
made.
and
the
legislative
history
is
quite
explicit
that
filled
with
those
complaints
and
congress
made
clear
when
it
created
the
board
that
it
was
doing
so
in
response
in
order
to
create
a
forum
for
resolution
of
those
disputed
issues.
and
we
think
the
fact
that
congress
was
focusing
on
that
illuminates
the
dissatisfaction
requirement
and
makes
clear
that
what
congress
was
doing
was
creating
a
body
designed
to
review
disputed
intermediary
determinations.
and
in
order
for
the
determination
to
be
disputed,
it's
got
to
be
raised
before
the
intermediary.
and
let
me
just
return
one
more
time
to
the
question
of
why
exhaustion
makes
sense
in
this
situation.
the
cost
reimbursement,
i
think
the
regulatory
challenge
in
this
case
may
be
somewhat
deceptive
in
terms
of
the
way
the
secretary's
cost
reimbursement
regulations
are
written.
in
this
case,
the
question
is
just
what
percentage
of
medical
malpractice
insurance
costs
are
going
to
be
allocated
to
the
medicare
program
and
just
reimbursable.
in
other
cases,
the
regulations
may
contain
more
flexible
definitions
of
whether
a
cost
is
reimbursable,
what
the
standard
is
for
reimbursement.
for
example,
the
secretary
treats
differently
transactions
between
related
entities,
and
the
definition
of
whether
an
entity
is
related
is
of
course
there
are
standards
set
out
in
the
regulations
but
those
standards
are
somewhat
flexible
in
application.
and
so
it
may,
a
providers
claim
is
really
always
just
a
claim
for
reimbursement.
and
the
fact
that
the
provider
places
a
particular
label
on
the
basis
for
its
legal
challenge
to
the
claim
may
not
be
determinative
of
how
the
claim
is
resolved.
so
we
think
it
is
deceptive
to
say,
this
is
a
regulation
challenge
so
we
can
put
it
in
this
box.
what
this
is
really,
is
just
a
claim
for
more
money,
and
the
provider
presumably
will
be
happy
to
get
the
money
on
any
basis
that
it
can.
and
frequently,
the
regulations
that
govern
that
question
will
have
some
flexibility
in
them.
and
we
think
that
the
intermediary
should
be
allowed
to
determine
in
the
first
instance,
or
given
the
opportunity
to
determine
in
the
first
instance,
whether
the
regulation
covers
the
particular
situation.
and
that
way,
the
question
as
it
goes
to
the
board
will
be
illuminated,
and
perhaps
the
claim
will
be
resolved
without
any
need
to
resolve
the
challenge
to
the
regulation.
similarly,
the
intermediary
may
find
that
the
particular
regulation
that
the
provider
wants
to
challenge
is
inapplicable
for
some
completely
unrelated
reason
that
the
provider
didn't
realize
or
didn't
want
to
bring
to
anyone's
attention
at
the
time.
and
we
think
because
of
the
complexity
of
the
situation,
it's
just
not
possible
to
pigeon-hole
a
claim
as
a
regulation
challenge
claim
and
automatically
give
that
some
exemption
from
the
exhaustion
requirement.
these
cost
reimbursement
issues
are
complex
and
we
think
that
the
better
course
is
to
allow
exhaustion
in
all
circumstances
so
that
the
intermediary
which
has
expertise
in
dealing
with
the
claim
has
the
opportunity
to
winnow
out
those
cases
that
actually
don't
involve
challenges
to
regulations.
and
save
the
board's
time
and
the
court's
time
for
challenges
that
actually
do.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
