if
you
win,
i
suppose
you...
you
say
the
regulation
is
invalid?
justice
white
well,
if
the
regulation
is
invalid,
what
will
you
do
with
your
next
cost
report?
justice
white
and
you
would
include
this
item?
justice
white
so
the
government
position
is
that
if
you
claim
the
regulation
is
invalid,
which
you
did,
you
should
file
your
cost
report
as
though
it
weren't
in
effect.
justice
white
what's
wrong
with
that?
if
you
really
believe
what
you
say,
well,
file
your
cost
report
that
way.
justice
white
is
to
live
up
to
a
regulation
even
though
you
claim
it's
invalid.
justice
white
even
though
you're
about
to
claim
that
it's
invalid?
justice
white
well,
you
know
what
to
do
now
that
it's
been
declared
invalid.
justice
white
i
said
you
did.
justice
white
is
your
interest
in
this
case
just
to
make
sure
you
follow
the
letter
of
the
law,
or
do
you,
does
the
secretary
really
have
some
substantial
reason
for
wanting
this
to
happen?
justice
white
what
is
efficient
about
filing
a
useless
claim?
justice
white
what
about
the
claim
that's
involved
in
this
case?
justice
white
or
at
least
you
think
it's
clear
enough
to
justify
your
regulation?
justice
white
well,
does
it
do
the
secretary
any
good
to
make
them
file
this
claim?
you
think
it
may
be
that
he
might
get
relief
on
some
other
basis?
justice
white
i
thought
it
was
also
because...
would
the
intermediary
ever
look
at
the
claim
if
it
were
filed?
justice
white
and
i
suppose,
would
the
intermediary
say,
well,
this
looks
like
a
straightforward
claim
that
is
barred
by
the
regulation
except
we
think
it's
too
big,
i
mean,
it's
just
erroneous.
if
there's
a
claim
like
this,
it's
only
half
this.
