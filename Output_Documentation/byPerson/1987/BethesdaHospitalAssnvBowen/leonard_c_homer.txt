mr.
leonard
c.
homer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
can
deny
medicare
providers
a
hearing
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
malpractice
premium
cost
they
are
reimbursed
under
his
regulations
on
the
grounds
that
they
followed
those
regulations
when
completing
their
cost
reports.
petitioners
bethesda
and
deaconess
provided
service
to
medicare
beneficiaries
and
should
not
be
denied
the
right
to
challenge
how
those
services
are
reimbursed
simply
because
they
followed
the
secretary's
regulations
in
completing
their
cost
reports.
after
listing
their
malpractice
premium
costs
in
the
cost
report,
bethesda
and
deaconess
had
three
options
available
to
them
when
the
apportioned
those
costs
between
medicare
and
non-medicare
patients.
first
option.
they
could
do
as
they
did
and
complete
the
cost
report
in
accordance
with
the
malpractice
regulation
and
submit
it
to
the
intermediary.
the
secretary
that
says
compliance
with
his
regulation
is
not
an
acceptable
option
if
one
is
to
challenge
that
regulation
before
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board.
second
option.
they
could
decline
to
follow
the
secretary's
regulation
and
apportion
the
cost
contrary
to
regulation
and
submit
it
to
the
intermediary.
the
secretary
says
through
an
informal
policy
that
has
been
adopted
that
this
is
what
they
should
have
done
if
they
wanted
to
challenge
the
regulation.
third
option.
they
could
apportion
their
malpractice
premium
costs
in
accordance
with
the
regulation,
submit
the
cost
report
to
the
intermediary
with
a
cover
letter
indicating
they
wanted
to
challenge
the
malpractice
regulation.
while
this
is
not
the
process
that
the
secretary
claims
to
be
necessary
for
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board,
which
i'll
refer
to
as
the
prrb,
to
entertain
such
a
challenge,
he
concedes
that
it
is
an
available
option.
now,
the
only
difference
between
the
first
option,
which
is
what
we
did,
completing
in
accordance
with
the
regulation
and
submitting
it
to
the
intermediary,
and
the
third
option,
completing
in
accordance
with
the
regulation
and
submitting
with
the
cover
letter
indicating
a
general
dissatisfaction
or
desire
to
challenge
the
regulation.
i'd
like
to
comment
first
on
this
second
option,
apportioning
costs
contrary
to
regulation.
the
secretary
contends
such
a
requirement
should
be
read
into
subparagraph
(a)(1)(a)
of
subsection
139500.
now,
there
is
a
practical
consideration
here
that
has
not
been
mentioned
in
the
briefs,
and
that
is
by
filing
costs
contrary
to
regulations,
providers
run
a
risk
of
the
intermediary
not
accepting
the
cost
report.
subparagraphs
(a)(1)(b)
and
(a)(1)(c)
provide
that
the
intermediary
cannot
be
required
to
render
a
final
determination
or
forced
to
proceed
with
a
final
determination
of
the
cost
of
the
reimbursement
due
unless
the
cost
reports
comply
with
the
secretary's
regulations.
and
also
with
regard
to
the
second
option,
no
purpose
is
served
by
filing
out
of
compliance
with
the
regulations.
the
intermediary
cannot
give
relief.
the
intermediary's
bound
by
contract
to
audit
the
cost
report
and
bring
it
into
compliance
with
regulations.
when
the
question
is
the
substance
of
the
regulation,
the
dispute
is
with
the
secretary,
not
the
intermediary.
filing
out
of
compliance
does
nothing
more
than
create
additional
work
for
the
intermediary
who
must
now
issue
an
audited
adjustment
and
conform
the
cost
report
so
that
it
complies
with
the
regulations,
redoing
the
calculations.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
no,
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
if
we
have
something
that's
by
definition
a
malpractice
cost,
then
it
must
be
allocated
in
accordance
with
the
malpractice
regulation.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
oh,
there
are
cases
in
those
instances
but
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about
today.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
the
fiscal
intermediary
is
required
and
they
spend
about
300
hours
on
a
medium
to
large
hospital
doing
the
audit
of
the
cost
report,
and
they
are
required
to
look
at
each
and
every
cost
and
determine
how
it
is
to
be
allocated
under
the
regulations.
there
may
be,
as
you
indicate,
an
instance
where
that
would
be
the
case.
let
me
given
an
example
of
a
different
kind
of
instance.
let's
said
that
we
made
an
error
in
the
filing
of
the
cost
report
and
we
made
the
error
in
the
government's
favor.
it
would
be
the
intermediary's
job
in
that
instance
when
they
do
the
audit
to
issue
an
audit
adjustment
in
the
provider's
favor,
bringing
that
allocation
into
conformity
with
the
regulations.
but
it's
not
something
where
they
take
advantage
of
the
mistakes
in
the
government's
favor
and
then
go
forward
with
the
regulations.
let's
go
further
and
say
the
intermediary
missed
that
and
there's
no
intermediary
action
or
audit
adjustment.
should
the
provider
have
a
right
to
a
hearing?
and
certainly
they
should.
because
the
first
time
the
provider
gets
to
the
government
agency
with
a
complaint
that
they
didn't
get
paid
what
they
should
have
for
their
services
is
when
they
go
to
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board.
the
cost
report
stops
with
the
intermediary.
it
does
not
go
on
to
the
agency
unless
it
is
appealed
to
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board.
and
i
had
mentioned,
there
is
no
purpose
served
by
filing
out
of
compliance.
and
if,
in
this
instance,
the
secretary
felt
that
there
was
a
purpose,
they
wanted
some
early
warning
of
an
intent
to
challenge
the
regulation,
in
this
particular
case,
these
providers
had
already
challenged
that
regulation
in
the
hadley
litigation
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
had
been
told
they
had
to
go
to
the
prrb,
only
to
be
tripped
up
by
this
informal
policy
with
regard
to
how
the
cost
report
is
to
be
completed.
with
regard
to
the
third
option,
that
is,
filing
the
cost
report
in
accordance
with
regulation
but
attaching
a
cover
letter
saying
you
want
to
challenge
the
regulation.
this
option
serves
no
purpose
at
either
the
audit
process
level
or
at
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board.
the
cover
letter
is
not
a
part
of
the
cost
report.
it
does
not
generate
any
intermediary
action
and
it
generates
no
intermediary
comment.
when
the
intermediary
renders
its
final
determination
of
total
program
reimbursement
due,
there
is
no
substantive
difference
between
what
we
did,
filing
in
compliance
with
the
regulation,
and
the
third
option
that
the
secretary
has
conceded
will
be
a
basis
for
jurisdiction,
that
is,
filing
in
compliance
and
attaching
a
cover
note
saying,
i
would
like
to
challenge
the
regulation.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
it's
not
clear
at
the
time
these
cost
reports
were
filed
whether
these
particular
hospitals,
i
believe
they
may
have
been
aware
of
that
option,
but
they
may
not
have
determined
that
they
wanted
to
continue
with
this
litigation
at
that
point.
and
they're
not
required
to
under
the
statute.
subsection
a
of
139500
says
you
don't
have
to
give
the
secretary
notice
that
you
want
to
litigate
until
you
get
your
final
determination
of
reimbursement
due.
and
there's
good
reason
for
that.
if
i'm
happy
with
the
amount
i
get,
i
may
not
choose
to
proceed
with
litigation
over
some
regulation
to
get
a
few
dollars
more.
that's
a
very
wise
choice
by
congress.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
as
i
mentioned,
subsection
a
is
the
basis
on
which
providers
are
entitled
to
proceed
for
a
hearing.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
continue
by
clarifying
a
point
that
was
made
by
justice
o'connor
and
that
is
the
fact
that
indeed
we
did
ask
for
reimbursement
of
malpractice
premium
costs.
we
entered
those
in
the
cost
report
and
then
apportioned
them
in
accordance
with
the
regulation
requiring
them
to
be
apportioned
in
the
manner
we
did,
and
then
proceeded
before
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board
to
ask
for
a
hearing
once
we
got
our
notice
of
program
reimbursement.
now,
the
secretary
claims
that
filing
the
cost
report
or
entering
costs
in
non-compliance
with
the
regulation
or
out
of
conformity
with
the
regulation
is
something
required
by
subparagraph
(a)(1)(a)
of
the
statute.
he
says
that
bethesda
and
deaconess
forfeited
their
right
to
a
hearing
by
following
his
regulations
when
they
completed
their
cost
report.
now,
subparagraph
(a)(1)(a)
of
139500
sets
forth
when
providers
have
a
right
to
proceed
to
a
hearing
before
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board.
it
says
that
the
provider
may
proceed
to
a
hearing
if,
and
i
will
quote,
"if
the
provider
is
dissatisfied
with
a
final
determination
of
its
fiscal
intermediary
as
to
the
amount
of
total
program
reimbursement
do.
"
the
secretary
asks
this
court
to
rewrite
subparagraph
(a)(1)(a)
so
that
it
reads,
"the
provider
may
obtain
a
hearing
only
if
dissatisfied
with
the
intermediary's
disallowance
of
costs
entered
in
the
cost
report
and
then
submitted
to
the
intermediary.
"
the
foundation
or
core
of
the
secretary's
argument
that
one
must
file
contrary
to
regulation
to
generate
the
intermediary
adjustment
is
his
characterization
of
the
cost
reporting
and
audit
process
as
an
adjudicative
process
in
which
the
intermediary
is
both
adversary
and
tribunal.
however,
if
you'll
keep
in
mind,
the
secretary
has
conceded
that
a
cover
letter
attached
to
a
cost
report
that
is
filed
in
compliance
with
the
regulation
will
suffice
for
jurisdiction.
and
as
i
mentioned,
the
cover
note
is
not
part
of
the
cost
report.
it
generates
no
intermediary
action
or
comment
when
the
final
determination
is
made.
indeed,
it
does
not
serve
a
single
purpose
advanced
by
the
secretary
for
this
purported
need
for
an
adjudicative
process
during
the
audit.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
statute
is
clear,
however.
the
statute
says
under
section
139500(a),
you
have
to
file
the
cost
report
and
that
you
have
to
file
a
claim
within
180
days
after
you've
received
your
notice
of
program
reimbursement
if
you're
dissatisfied
with
the
total
amount
of
reimbursement
received.
it
doesn't
say,
if
you're
dissatisfied
with
an
intermediary
adjustment.
it
says,
total
amount
of
reimbursement
received,
and
that's
the
bottom
line,
how
much
we
got
for
our
services.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
the
regulation
has
been
declared
invalid.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
the
next
cost
report
would
be
filed
under
the
prevailing
regulation
at
the
time
and
that's
invalid.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
we
would
follow
the
regulation
that's
in
existence
telling
how
we
include
it.
the
item
is
included.
it's
just
a
matter
of
how
you
apportion
it
between
medicare
and
non-medicare
patients.
so
that
we
would
follow
the
prevailing
regulation
at
the
time.
the
prevailing
regulation
according
to
three
circuits
is
the
pre-1979
regulation,
which
is
based
on
utilization.
three
of
the
circuits
have
said
that
the
secretary
cannot
retroactively
apply
his
1986
rule.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
well,
it
gets
down
to
a
matter
of
being
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
the
tendency,
when
you're
filing
a
document,--
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
tendency
is
to
follow
directions.
you're
talking
about
a
cost
report
that's
150
pages
long
with
very
complex
calculations
and
you
tend
to
follow
the
directions
when
you
complete
that.
and
the
regulation
says,
do
it
this
way,
so
that's
the
way
you
do
it.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
no
effective
notice
given
by
the
secretary
as
to
how
to
proceed
if
you
want
to
claim
a
regulation
is
invalid.
if
they
wanted
to
give
effective
notice,
what
they
would
have
to
do--
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
--as
a
matter
of
fact,--
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
--that's
right,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
number
of
the
hospitals
in
this
very
group
appeal
filed
it
as
the
secretary
suggested
out
of
conformity
with
regulations
three
years
in
a
row
and
then
slipped
up
the
fourth
year
because
they
followed
directions.
it's
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
and
the
point
is,
i
believe,
that
the
secretary
has
no
authority
to
impose
that
condition
precedent
at
the
cost
reporting
level.
the
only
express
power
given
to
the
secretary
under
subsection
(a)
of
139500
is
to
set
the
time
within
which
cost
reports
may
be
filed.
that
is
the
only
express
authority
given
the
secretary
to
deal
with
that
front
end
part
of
it.
absent
the
express
authority
to
impose
a
condition
precedent
that
would
narrow
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that's
involved
in
this
case,
it
should
not
be
implied.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
the
secretary's
position
is
that
the
latter
course
will
not
work.
it's
the
secretary's
position
that
you
have
to
proceed--
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
--there
is
no
analogy
in
the
income
tax
field
in
this
instance,
because
the
secretary's
position
is
that--
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
--yes,
i
think
there
is
an
analogy.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
what
i
should
say
with
regard
to
the
secretary's
position
on
his
concession
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
a
cover
letter
being
a
basis
for
prrb
jurisdiction
is
that
when
he
conceded
that,
he
conceded
away
his
entire
case.
the
simple
fact
is
that
those
cost
reports
are
filed
in
compliance
with
the
regulation.
the
intermediary
does
not
touch
that
cover
letter.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
that's
why
i
had
pointed
that
out.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
he
concedes
this
cover
note
point
in
footnote
8
on
page
11.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
that
would
appear
to
be
the
basis
because
that
would
avoid
1(b)
and
(c).
however,
if
you'll
notice,
that
is
a
concession
in
the
footnote
and
that
is
the
only
point
you'll
see
in
the
secretary's
brief.
because
the
secretary's
entire
argument
is
based
upon
the
need
for
the
adjudicative
process
in
the
cost
reporting
and
audit
process.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
and
that
is
why
he
has
conceded
the
whole
thing
away
with
this
concession.
the
secretary
has
never
promulgated
a
regulation
saying,
thou
shalt
attach
a
cover
note
to
the
cost
report
if
you
want
to
proceed
with
a
challenge
to
the
regulation.
and
my
point
is
that
the
secretary
doesn't
have
the
power
in
any
event
to
attach
such
a
condition
precedent
at
that
point
under
either
subsection
(a)
which
specifically
says
when
we
are
entitled
to
proceed
with
a
hearing
before
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board.
also,
even
if
you
look
at
filing
out
of
conformity
with
the
regulation,
it
serves
no
purpose
whatsoever
because
the
dispute
is
with
the
substance
of
the
regulation,
not
with
the
intermediary.
the
intermediary
cannot
give
relief
if
you
are
taking
contrary
to
a
regulation.
they
are
bound
to
apply
the
regulation.
a
point
that
should
be
made
is
that
the
secretary
argues
that
he
should
be
given
deference
in
his
proposed
reading
of
subsection
(a).
now,
congress
has
addressed
the
issue
of
when
a
provider
is
entitled
to
review.
and
the
language
used
is
clear
and
without
ambiguity.
what
could
be
clearer
than
being
entitled
to
a
hearing
when
one
is
dissatisfied
with
the
total
amount
of
program
reimbursement
determined
to
be
due.
interestingly,
although
the
secretary
asks
for
deference,
not
once
in
his
brief
has
he
asserted
any
ambiguity
in
the
language
of
section
139500.
even
if
you
take
his
assertions,
ignoring
the
ambiguity
issue
which
i
think
once
when
the
statute
addresses
something
and
there's
no
ambiguity,
there's
no
room
to
talk
about
deference,
but
looking
at
what
he
proposes,
he
says
that
his
reading
is
a
permissible
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
he
attempts
to
urge
ambiguity
through
the
argumentation.
he
does
not
at
any
point
directly
assert
that
the
language
of
subsection
(a)
is
ambiguous.
and
he
uses
the
word,
dissatisfied,
in
isolation.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
well,
you're
correct
that
he
is
arguing
it's
clear
in
his
direction.
but
that
is
not
something
that
entitles
him
to
deference.
he
can
argue
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
what
he's
arguing
for
is
an
intermediary
adjustment
and
us
being
required
to
file
contrary
to
regulation,
and
there's
nothing
like
that
in
the
statutory
language.
and
his
argument
that
we
have
to
file
contrary
to
the
malpractice
regulation,
as
i
mentioned,
runs
specifically
afoul
of
subparagraphs
(a)(1)(b)
and
(a)(1)(c)
where
he's
saying
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
to
violate
the
regulation
to
get
a
right
to
challenge
it.
on
the
other
hand,
the
congress
is
saying,
if
we
don't
follow
the
regulation,
they
can
sit
on
the
cost
report.
and
if
anything
creates
an
inconsistency
within
the
statutory
language
itself,
it's
that
reading
and
that
was
not
a
permissible
reading.
and
also
as
i
mentioned,
not
a
single
reason
urged
by
the
secretary
in
support
of
deference
survives
his
concession
as
to
the
cover
note
jurisdiction.
because
if
you
look
at
every
reason
advanced,
it
all
flows
through
the
notion
of
an
adversary
proceeding
at
the
audit
level.
and
if
the
cover
note
is
not
looked
at
by
the
intermediary
and
not
commented
on,
there
is
no
adversary
proceeding
at
the
audit
level.
and
this
is
a
situation
where
none
of
the
reasons
urged
for
deference
hold
up
or
survive
his
argument.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
let
me
first
focus
on
the
issue
of
dissatisfaction.
and
what
it
seems
to
boil
down
to
is
when
we
are
supposed
to
be
dissatisfied.
the
statute
says
we
are
to
be
dissatisfied
when
we
learn
what
our
total
reimbursement
is
at
the
time
the
intermediary
makes
its
final
determination.
the
secretary
says,
no,
we're
to
be
dissatisfied
and
express
that
dissatisfaction
when
we
file
the
cost
report.
now,
what's
to
stop
the
secretary
from
moving
that
back
further
and
saying,
no,
when
you
signed
up
as
a
provider,
you
knew
what
the
regulations
were
and
you
should
have
attached
an
addendum
to
your
provider
agreement
saying
your
dissatisfied
with
these
regulations.
otherwise,
we're
not
going
to
hear
a
challenge
to
the
regulation.
the
difficult
area
that
is
being
presented
to
you
is
the
fact
that
the
cost
report
and
audit
process
is
being
presented
to
you
by
the
secretary
as
an
adversary
process.
the
secretary
relies
on
notions
of
exhaustion.
it
is
not
a
remedy
when
i
hand
you
a
bill
of
costs
for
the
services
i've
rendered
and
say,
pay
me
under
your
contract.
the
remedy
aspect
of
it
doesn't
start
until
you
short
change
me.
and
that
is
what
has
happened
under
this
regulation.
the
secretary
has
short
changed
us
and
we--
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
--at
the
board,
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
process
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
cost
reports
don't
even
go
to
the
board.
the
cost
reports
stop
with
the
intermediary
unless
there's
a
challenge
taken
to
the
board,
they
send
them
to
storage
out
in
st.
louis
somewhere.
they
don't
go
to
the
government.
the
government
doesn't
see
them
unless
the
audit
the
intermediary
to
see
if
the
intermediary's
doing
their
job
so
that
the
first
time
that
we
stand
at
the
threshold
of
the
agency,
is
when
we
ask
for
a
hearing
before
the
prrb.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
at
the
audit
level,
there
is
a
process
by
which
the
intermediary
takes
the
costs
that
have
been
entered
in
the
cost
report
and
reviews
them
to
assure
that
the
costs
were
indeed
incurred,
and
that
they
have
been
treated
by
the
provider
in
accordance
with
the
regulations.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
an
accounting
type
judgment.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
it's
no
different
than
any
other
government
contract
on
a
cost
basis.
all
we
did
was
provide
services
on
what
is
in
effect
is
a
cost
contract
and
ask
to
be
paid.
the
decisional
part,
other
than
just
as
government
auditors
come
into
g.e.
and
do
an
audit
on
the
government
contract,
that's
not
a
remedy.
that
is
their
attempt
to
get
paid
for
their
services.
the
remedy
phase
of
it
starts
once
they
have
been
denied
what
they
feel,
in
this
instance,
what
their
total
reimbursement
is
that
they
are
dissatisfied
with
that
amount.
and
on
that
basis,
that's
where
ringer
and
southland
and
the
other
cases
of
that
type
are
not
applicable
in
this
instance.
we
did
what
was
required.
we
filed
the
cost
report
as
the
regulations
require
and
presented
it
to
the
intermediary,
and
then
when
we
got
our
notice
of
program
reimbursement
back,
then
we
filed
our
appeal
with
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board.
we
didn't
skip
any
administrative
steps.
and
with
that,
unless
the
court
has
additional
questions,
that
is
my
argument.
mr.
leonard
c.
homer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
actually,
that
is
one
of
the
arguments
made
under
subsection
(d)
which
the
secretary
has
conceded
does
not
control
access
to
the
prrb
or
entitlement
to
a
hearing.
there
is
nothing
discretionary
in
the
language
of
subsection
(a).
and
let's
face
it,
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board
is
our
first
contact
with
the
agency.
if
we've
slipped
up
somewhere
in
the
cost
report,
and
that's
not
the
case
in
this
case
with
the
regulation,
but
say
something
where
there
could
have
been
discretion,
why
shouldn't
we
be
able
to
stand
before
the
agency
and
say,
well,
we
think
we're
entitled
to
more.
and
that's
what
congress
has
said.
