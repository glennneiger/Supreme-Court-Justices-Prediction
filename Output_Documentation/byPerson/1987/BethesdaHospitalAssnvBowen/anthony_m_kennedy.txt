would
assume
though
that
the
intermediary
could
reallocate
the
claimed
costs
under
some
other
category
that
was
permissible.
if
you
claimed
$15,000
for
malpractice,
it
might
find
a
way
to
give
you
$8,000
or
$9,000
of
those
costs
under
some
other
category.

but
aren't
there
cases
where
it's
difficult
to
characterize
costs,
or
there's
some
question
as
to
their
proper
characterization?
justice
kennedy
well,
insofar
as
the
rule
is
concerned,
might
not
there
be
instances
where
how
to
characterize
a
cost
is
open
to
question
and
so
it
serves
a
purpose
to
submit
the
issue
to
the
fiscal
intermediary
for
its
determination
as
to
allocation?

this

presents
a
statutory

issue
under

the

were
divided
and
we
issued
certiorari
to
the
court
of

for
the
six

to
resolve
the
point.
two

like
to

in
the
district
court,
the
secretary
argued
that
the
providers
were
barred
from
making
a
challenge
because
they
had
not
raised
the

in
the

the

construing
the
statute,
we
find
that
the

is
not
barred
in
the
district
court.
the
structure
of
the
statute
permits
the
provider
to
challenge
a
regulation
if
the

is
raised
at

level
after
the
cost
report
has
been
filed
with

the

did.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
