h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
86-1764,
bethesda
hospital
association
versus
otis
bowen,
secretary
of
health
and
human
services.
mr.
homer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
homer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
homer,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
suppose
if
the
statute
were
clear,
it
really
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
served
any
purpose
or
not.
if
congress
says
you
have
to
file
this
report
to
have
it
considered
and
you
have
to
make
this
claim
to
have
it
considered,
that's
that,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
homer.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
will
we
find
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
said,
this
language,
mr.
pincus,
it's
just
a
solid
page.
is
there
any
particular
part
of
it
you're
referring
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
mr.
homer,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
there's
no
decisional
process
going
on
within
the
board
before
they
short
change
you,
as
you
put
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
about
a
decisional
process
of
the
intermediary?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there's
some
judgment
exercised
there,
surely.
it
isn't
just--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
but
how
different
is
an
accounting
type
judgment
than
the
sort
of
judgments
many
other
legal
review
boards
make?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
homer.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
86-1764,
bethesda
hospital
association
versus
bowen
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
