mr.
pincus,
can
i
ask
one
factual
question
i
was
a
little
unclear
on?
there
is
now
an
unpaved
segment
that
joins
the
two
roads,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
possible
today
to
drive
from
one...
from
the
point
of
origin
to
the
point
of
destination
by
just
going
over
six
or
seven
miles
of
unpaved
road?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
also
true,
just
noticing
on
page
8-a,
that
they
talk
about
the
activity
of
the
logging
and
all
as
part
of
what
is
destructive,
the
very
core
of
the
indian
practices.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
and
they
agreed
with
that
finding
as
the
basis
for
their
analysis.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
take
the
logging
out,
you
both
lessen
the
impact
on
the
indians
and
you
lessen
the
government
justification.
i
mean,
it
kind
of
helps
both
sides
or
hurts
both
sides,
but
it's
a
different
case
without
logging
than
it
is
with
logging.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
this
then.
before
the
designation
of
the
wilderness
area,
had
an
unpaved
road
that
went
through
here,
was
there
traffic
on
that
road
from
time
to
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
you
have
nothing
but
a
road
and
no
logging,
you've
had
it
in
an
unpaved
pasture
and
apparently
the
indian
religion
survived
that,
and
the
only
difference,
according
to
your
view,
i
guess,
is
you
changed
it
from
unpaved
to
paved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one...
maybe
it's
kind
of
a
silly
question,
but
we
talk
about
the
government
interest
in
building
land.
congress
has
kind
of
delegated
the
problem,
i
guess,
to
the
court
to
decide
whether...
it
hasn't
really
taken
a
position
on
whether
the...
what
is
the
highest
official
who
has
actually
made
the
decision
to
build
this
road?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
chief
of
the
forest
service.
it
hasn't
even
gone
to
the
secretary.
is
he
in
the
interior
department?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
he
in
the
same
department
that
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
is
in,
the
interior
department?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
agriculture.
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
help
me
with
one
other
factor?
we've
got
the
logging
out
of
the
case
now,
but
what
about
the
situation
that
existed
when
they
hit
an
unpaved
road?
was
there
traffic
through
there
that
had
an
adverse
impact
on
the
religious
practices
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
won't
be
using
logging
trucks
in
the
future
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
will
be
no
logging
trucks
on
the
paved
road
in
the
future,
will
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
we
know
that
there
will
be
any
more
traffic
on
the
paved
road
than
there
was
on
the
unpaved
road,
and
if
it
didn't
harm
the
religion
sufficiently
when
it
was
unpaved,
why,
without
any
logging
in
the
case,
why
is
there
such
a
big
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
they
have
to
cross
the
unpaved
road
and
look
before
they
cross?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
the
difference
is
in
the
amount
of
traffic.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
am
puzzled
by
one
of
the...
you
mentioned
a
large
number
of
non-indians
who
also
are
able
to
come
and
go
in
this
area,
even
during--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
it
true
that
those
people
may
be
spiritually
unacceptable
to
the
people
around
their
religious
missions
at
the
time
because
of
their
condition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
about...
is
that
a
greater
burden
than
the
use
of
the
road?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
same
sort
of
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question?
i
gather
that
you're
going
to
have
to
prepare
an
environmental
impact
statement
to
comply
with
the
other
part
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
will
that
statement
contain
any
analysis
of
the
extent,
probable
extent
of
use
of
the
road
and
how
much
it
will
affect
the
environment?
presumably
perhaps
even
the
indian
practices
here.
i
wonder
if
we
know
enough
about
the
facts
to
even
apply
the
test
your
opponent
relies
on.
you
say
we
don't
want
to
use
that
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
say
it's
okay
with
you,
but
i'm
just
wondering,
to
what
extent
may
there
actually
be
more
enlightenment
on
this
issue
by
the
things
that
must
be
done
before
you
can
build
the
road
anyway?
