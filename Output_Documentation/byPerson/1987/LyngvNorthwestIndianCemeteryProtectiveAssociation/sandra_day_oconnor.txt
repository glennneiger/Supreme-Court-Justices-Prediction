justice
sandra

o'connor
i
see.
i
don't
understand.
do
you
mean
if
it's
paved,
then
it
isn't
part
of
the
wilderness
designation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
why
couldn't
a
car
drive
today
over
the
unpaved
portion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
on
a
different
location?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
see.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
pincus,
while
you're
interrupted,
i
think
the
courts
below
held
that
the
government
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
national
environmental
policy
act
and
the
clean
water
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
about
that?
i
suppose
you
didn't
appeal
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
proceedings
going
forward
to
comply
with
those
two
acts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
is
it
that
the
courts
below
dealt
with
the
constitutional
issue
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
had
these
statutory
ones
to
rely
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
do
you
think
we
should
reach
the
constitutional
issue,
mr.
pincus?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
should
we
just
vacate
the
opinion
and
judgment
below
and
say
you've
done
enough
when
you
decided
the
statutory
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
it
your
position,
mr.
pincus,
that
the
government
need
not
make
any
concessions
whatever
to
the
interests
of
the
indians
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
miles,
would
your
clients
take
the
position
that
any
use
that
might
interfere
with
the
religious
practices
of
your
clients
would
mandate
the
kind
of
constitutional
view
that
you
are
urging?
for
example,
proceedings
by
forest
service
rangers
in
connection
with
fire
protection
or
a
boy
scout
encampment
or
the
uses
by
other
people
of
the
forest
area.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wouldn't
that
burden
the
religious
practices
in
the
same
way,
by
creating
noise
and
disturbance
and--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
it
would?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would
be
a
burden?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
suppose
the
claim
could
be
made
in
the
future,
that
any
use,
including
that
by
other
non-indians,
of
the
forest
service
land
would
constitute
a
sufficient
burden
that
it
must
be
prohibited?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
could?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
your
clients
might
make
that
kind
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
you
said
that
potentially
it
could
be
in
another
case.
you
said
it
wasn't
raised
here,
but
it
certainly
could
constitute
a
burden,
depending
upon
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
use
by
non-indians
of
that
property.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
bowen
v.
roy
addresses
itself
rather
specifically
to
your
free
exercise
claim
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
roy
opinion
says
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
the
government
itself
to
behave
in
ways
the
individual
believes
will
further
his
or
her
spiritual
development.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
that
is
rather
the
implication
of
that
language
in
bowen
v.
roy,
and
i
just
wonder
how
you
get
around
that.
the
thrust
of
it
is
that
the
government
needn't
use
its
own
property
in
such
a
way
as
to
account
for
the
religious
activities
or
beliefs
of
others.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
anything,
the
consequence
asserted
in
the
bowen
v.
roy
case
was
perhaps
more
severe
than
in
yours
because
the
allegation
was
that
the
daughter
had
been
deprived
and
robbed
of
her
spirit
by
this
government
activity,
and
i
would
think
that
might
even
be
a
more
serious
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
lyng
case
no.
86-1013,
the
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
involves
a
dispute
about
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment
right
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
the
court
of
appeals
approved
a
permanent
injunction
forbidding
the
federal
government
from
constructing
a
road
through
the
chimney
rock
area
of
the
six
rivers
national
forest
in
california.
this
area
of
the
national
forest
has
traditionally
been
used
for
religious
rituals
by
members
of
three
american-indian
tribes
that
live
nearby.
those
religious
practices
which
require
privacy,
silence,
and
an
undisturbed
natural
setting
can
only
be
carried
out
at
specific
sites
in
the
chimney
rock
area.
the
court
below
found
that
the
proposed
road
would
so
disturb
the
natural
environment
that
it
would
virtually
destroy
the
indians'
ability
to
practice
their
religion.
the
court
also
found
that
the
government
had
failed
to
demonstrate
a
compelling
interest
in
completing
the
project.
using
a
balancing
test
to
weight
the
indians'
interest
and
that
of
the
united
states,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
indians'
right
to
their
free
exercise
of
their
religion
would
be
unconstitutionally
infringed
by
the
government's
proposed
activities
in
the
chimney
rock
area.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
two
terms
ago
in
the
case
of
bowen
against
roy,
we
held
that
the
free
exercise
clause
cannot
be
understood
to
require
the
government
to
conduct
its
own
internal
affairs
in
ways
that
comport
with
the
religious
belief
of
particular
citizens.
in
that
case
as
in
this
one,
the
government's
management
of
its
internal
affairs
threaten
to
interfere
significantly
with
the
ability
of
private
people
to
pursue
spiritual
fulfillment
according
to
their
own
religious
beliefs.
in
neither
case,
however,
did
the
government's
proposed
action
threatened
either
to
coerce
religious
adherence
and
the
acting
contrary
to
their
belief
or
to
penalize
religious
adherence
for
exercising
their
religious
freedom.
our
decision
in
bowen
against
roy,
therefore,
compels
us
to
conclude
that
the
free
exercise
challenge
to
the
government's
construction
project
must
fail.
we
note,
however,
that
the
government's
right
to
manage
the
public
lands
need
not
and
should
not
discourage
it
from
accommodating
religious
practices
like
those
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
american-indian
religious
freedom
act
establishes
a
national
policy
in
favor
of
protecting
and
preserving
the
right
of
indians
to
visit
their
traditional
religious
sites
and
to
carry
out
their
traditional
rituals.
although
this
statute
does
not
create
enforceable
legal
rights,
it
does
encourage
the
government
to
minimize
the
extent
to
which
its
management
of
the
public
lands
interferes
with
indian
religious
practices.
in
this
case
the
government
has
planned
various
ways
for
minimizing
the
effects
that
its
road
will
have
on
the
chimney
rock
area
and
nothing
in
our
decision
should
discourage
such
ameliorative
measures.
the
case
is
remanded
for
deciding
certain
statutory
issues,
which
we
have
not
addressed.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
have
joined.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
