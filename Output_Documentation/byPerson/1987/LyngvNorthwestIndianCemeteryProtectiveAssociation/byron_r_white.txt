so,
you
say
that
the
government
must
keep
loggers
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
government
must
at
least
keep
loggers
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
say
that
the
place
be
reserved
for
your
use
rather
than
logging
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
mind
if
loggers
came
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
certainly
is
a
substantial
restriction
in
favor
of
religion
on
what
the
government
can
do
with
its
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
act
that
you're
talking
about
is
whether
loggers
can
come
in.
so,
this
twenty-five
miles
is
sealed
off
from
logging.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
you
have
the
same
objection
to
logging
going
on
in
any
part
of
the
twenty-five
miles?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
isn't
that
reserving...
why
isn't
that
excluding
loggers
from
twenty-five
square
miles?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
that
the
free
exercise
clause
forbids
the
government
permitting
loggers
to
come
in
to
that
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
saying
yes,
that
twenty-five
miles
is
sealed
off
from
loggers
because
the
area
is
central
to
the
practice
of
religious
beliefs.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
the
government
decided
to
improve
some
back-packing
trails
or
build
some
overnight
cabins
in
that
high
country,
you
would
have
the
same
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
hunting?
how
about
hunting
by
non-indians?
is
that
area
open
in
some
hunting
seasons
to
hunt
deer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
that
might
that
not
seriously
disturb
indian
religious
practices?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
were,
then
you
would
say
the
government
must
prevent
hunters
from
entering
that
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
motorcycles
and
jeeps
in
that
area?
do
you
object
to
any
kind
of
vehicular
traffic
that
could
get
into
that
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
organized
camping
trips
into
the
high
country,
with
horses
and
tents,
where
packers
bring
in
large
numbers
of
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it
that
you...
now
that
the
area
is
a
designated
wilderness
area,
what
specifically
does
the
government
propose
to
do
that
you
disagree
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
paving?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
does
the
government...
why
does
the
government
want
to
do...
go
forward
with
that
now
that
the
surrounding
area
has
been
designated
a
wilderness
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
increased
access
to
a
wilderness
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
they
still
propose
to
build
it,
i
suppose
that's
what
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
still
wants
to
go
ahead
with
this
road?
justice
byron
r.
white
paving
this
road?
