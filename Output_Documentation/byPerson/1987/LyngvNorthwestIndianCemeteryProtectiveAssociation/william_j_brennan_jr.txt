would
that
include
the
strip
where
the
six-mile
road
would
be
built?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
within
it
are
sites
used
by
the
indians
for
their
practices?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
if
actually
the
site
included
the
site
of
the
six-mile
road,
that
might
have
a
bearing,
might
it
not,
on
the
extent
of
the
burden
on
their
free
exercise
rights?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
ms.
miles?
are
you
suggesting
that
if
the
intrusion
is
limited
only
to
a
mile,
nevertheless,
since
the
area
is
twenty-five
miles,
it's
an
intrusion
against
the
whole?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
it's
occurring,
i
gather,
only
at
the
six-mile
strip,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
an
invasion
of
the
whole
site
or
twenty-five
miles,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ms.
miles,
do
you
rely
at
all
on
the
american
indian
religious
freedom
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
it
help
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
indispensability
tests--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--you
do?
