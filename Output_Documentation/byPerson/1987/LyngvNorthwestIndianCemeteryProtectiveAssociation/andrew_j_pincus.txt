mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
free
exercise
clause
bars
the
government
from
constructing
a
road
on
government
land
in
a
national
forest
and
from
harvesting
timber
in
that
forest.
the
site
of
these
proposed
government
actions
is
the
northern
part
of
the
six
rivers
national
forest,
which
is
located
in
northern
california.
it
is
important
to
note
at
the
outset
that
this
land
was
never
contained
within
an
indian
reservation,
is
not
the
subject
of
indian
treaty,
and
is
not
otherwise
impressed
with
any
indian
trust
obligation.
let
me
begin
by
briefly
discussing
the
history
of
the
forest
service's
decision
to
construct
the
road.
since
at
least
the
1930s,
a
series
of
unpaved
roads
through
six
rivers
national
forest
has
linked
the
california
towns
of
gasquet
and
orleans.
the
forest
service
concluded
in
the
1960s
that
an
improved
road
network
was
necessary
both
for
its
timber
harvesting
program
and
for
other
purposes,
and
it
embarked
upon
a
plan
to
construct
a
paved
road
linking
the
two
towns.
two
separate
segments
of
the
road
totalling
forty-nine
miles
have
now
been
completed.
all
that
remains
is
the
construction
of
a
six-mile
paved
segment
that
will
link
up
the
two
completed
segments
and
complete
the
road.
in
1977,
forest
service
issued
a
draft
environmental
impact
statement
discussing
alternative
proposals
for
the
construction
of
the
remaining
segment
of
the
road.
the
comments
received
by
the
forest
service
indicated
that
the
area
had
religious
significance
for
several
indian
tribes.
the
forest
service
accordingly
deferred
its
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
construct
the
road
and
commissioned
a
comprehensive
ethnographic
study
of
the
indian
cultural
and
religious
sites
that
were
located
in
the
area.
the
423-page
report,
prepared
at
the
forest
service's
direction,
revealed
that
a
portion
of
the
six
rivers
national
forest
is
known
to
the
yurok,
karok
and
tolowa
indian
tribes
as
the
"high
country"
and
that
many
of
these
tribes'
religious
beliefs
and
rituals
focus
upon
that
area.
journeys
to
the
high
country
are
an
important
part
of
the
indians'
religious
practices,
and
these
journeys
frequently
include
the
performance
of
rituals
at
specific
sites
in
the
high
country.
the
report
stated
that
a
successful
spiritual--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
the
entire--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--your
honor,
it's
not
clear
from
the
record,
i
don't
think,
whether
specific
sites...
i
don't
think
that
the
report
purported
to
document
every
exact
site
where
a
ritual
is
performed.
for
example,
part
of
the
ritual
is
the
way
one
acts
when...
at
any
time
one
is
in
the
high
country.
so,
i
think
from
the
indians'
point
of
view,
it
is
leading
to
distinguish
between
the
sites
at
which
actual
rituals
are
performed
and
the
other
sites,
because
i
think
from
their
point
of
view,
the
entire
area
is
sacred.
i
don't
think
that
any
of
the
sites,
at
least
the
principal
sites,
of
greatest
spiritual
significance,
those
are
not
located
where
the
road
would
be
built.
those
are
located
away
from
the
road.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
as
i
said,
from
the
indians'
point
of
view,
i
don't
think
they
would
distinguish
in
any
way
between
the
site.
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
sites
where
rituals
are
performed
are
not...
the
road
is
not
going
to
go
over
those
particular
sites.
the
report
stated
that
a
successful
spiritual
use
of
the
high
country
is
dependent
upon
and
facilitated
by
certain
qualities
of
the
physical
environment.
the
most
important
of
which
are
privacy,
silence
and
an
undisturbed
natural
setting.
the
forest
service
consultants
concluded
that
construction
of
the
road
would
eliminate
the
required
natural
conditions
and
would,
therefore,
seriously
damage
the
indians'
religious
beliefs.
that's
why,
in
further
answer
to
your
question,
justice
brennan,
the
indians,
if
they
are
on
a
site
where
they
are
conducting
a
ritual,
the
fact
that
another
part
of
the
high
country
has
been
disturbed
or
changed
from
its
natural
state
is
as
much
of
a
burden
as
if
that
actual
site
that
they
were
standing
on
had
been
disturbed.
so,
they
just
don't
make
a
distinction.
after
considering
the
consultants'
report,
the
forest
service
announced
its
decision
regarding
the
construction
of
the
road.
the
service
found
that
the
completion
of
the
road
was
very
significant
to
the
development
of
timber
and
recreational
resources
in
the
area
and
that
the
road
would
enhance
the
efficiency
of
administrative
services,
such
as
fire
control.
at
the
same
time,
the
forest
service
recognized
the
importance
of
the
indians'
religious
interests
in
the
area.
it
reconciled
these
two
opposing
interests
by
determining
to
go
ahead
with
the
construction
of
the
road,
but
to
do
so
in
a
manner
that
minimized
the
intrusion
upon
the
indians'
religious
interests.
the
service
emphasized
that
construction
of
the
road
would
not
deprive
any
believer
of
access
to
the
sacred
area,
and
it
adopted
the
route
alternative
that
was
located
farthest
away
from
significant
spiritual
sites.
finally,
it
specified
mitigation
measures
in
connection
with
the
design
of
the
road
that
would
reduce
the
audio
and
visual
impact
of
the
road
on
the
surrounding
area.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
it's
the
remaining
unpaved
segment
that
was
left
from
the
original
when
the
entire
road
was
unpaved,
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
it's
not
because
congress
designated
after
the
district
court
proceedings
in
this
case,
congress
designated
a
large
segment
of
this
area
as
a
wilderness,
and
what
the
wilderness
designation
does
is
to
close
the
area
to
traffic,
and
the
site
of
the
paved
road
was
preempted
from
the
wilderness
designation.
the
site
of
the
unpaved
road
is
included
in
the
wilderness
designation.
so,
it
can't
be
used
anymore.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no.
congress
specifically
exempted,
drew
the
boundaries
of
the
wilderness
designation
so
as
to
permit
the
construction
of
the
road.
it
drew
the
wilderness
boundaries
so
that
they
did
not
include
the
site
that
the
forest
service
had
designated
for
the
road.
so,
congress
made
the
decision.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
the
paved
road--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it's
on
a
different
site.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
route
alternative
that
the
forest
service
selected
was
actually
farther
away
from
the
specific
spiritual
sites
than
the
unpaved
road
was,
and,
so,
it's
a
different
site
in
that
the
site
of
the
unpaved
road
is
in
the
wilderness
designation.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
they
did.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor.
we
only
sought
review
of
the
constitutional
determination.
what
the
courts
did
below
put
us
in
a
little
bit
of
a
pickle.
we
did
not
believe
that
the
adverse
rulings
on
the
nepa
and
the
clean
water
act
questions
warranted
review
by
this
court,
and
we
believed
that
we
could
comply
with
those
rulings.
in
fact,
we
don't
intend
to
challenge
them.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
the
forest
service
internally
is
working
to
revise
its
plans
to
comply.
i
don't
think
any
public
proceedings
have
taken
place
pending
this
court's
decision
on
the
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
i
can't
speak
for
them
as
to
why
they
went
ahead
to
reach...
actually,
the
way
they
wrote
their
opinions--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
we
think,
as
we
said
in
our
certiorari
petition,
we
believe
that
we
can
comply
and
we
have
every
intention
of
complying
with
the
rulings
on
the
statutory
grounds
and
that,
really,
the
only--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
that
is
one
option
for
the
court.
we
think
since
the
issue...
in
our
certiorari
petition,
we
suggest
it
as
an
alternative
to
granting
plenary
reviews.
the
court
might
want
to
take
that
step
and
let
the
lower
courts
reinstate
their
constitutional
rulings
after
compliance
was
shown.
we
think
now
that
the
issue
has
been
briefed,
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
court
to
go
ahead
and
decide
it,
and
as
i
say,
we
think
there
is
still
a
lot
of
controversy
because
the
government
has
every
intention
of
complying
with
those
rulings
and
believes
it
can
comply,
and
that
the
only
obstacle
to
completion
of
the
road
is,
in
fact,
the
injunction
on
constitutional
grounds.
let
me
just
turn
to
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court
and
specifically
the
district
court's
findings
with
respect
to
the
free
exercise
issue.
what
the
district
court
found,
and
this
finding
is
at
pages
64-a
and
65-a
of
the
appendix
to
the
certiorari
petition,
was
as
follows:
communication
with
the
great
creator
is
possible
in
the
high
country
because
of
the
pristine
environment
and
opportunity
for
solitude
found
there.
construction
of
the
chimney
rock
section
of
the
road
and/or
the
harvesting
of
timber
in
the
high
country,
including
clear
cutting,
would
seriously
damage
the
salient
visual,
oral
and
environmental
qualities
of
the
high
country.
and
in
that
effect,
the
court
concluded,
was
the
burden
on
the
free
exercise
of
religion
that
implicated
the
guarantee
in
the
first
amendment.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
to
a
large--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--there
are
two
administrative
decisions
before
the
court,
the
road
decision
and
then
the
separate
decision
to
adopt
the
management
plan
that
provided
for
cutting
in
this
area
of
a
forest.
after
the
district
court
rendered
its
decision,
congress
passed
the
statute
that
designated
the
area
as
wilderness
and
that
really
covers
the
great
bulk
of
the
area
that
the
court
set
aside
under
the
first
amendment.
so,
as
a
practical
matter,
that
issue
is
gone.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
the
district
court
said,
really,
was
that
anything
that
changed
the
area
from
its
natural
pristine
state
was
an
interference
with
the
indians'
religious
beliefs.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
didn't
indicate
that
there
was
any
cumulative
effect.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it's
possible.
certainly
one
option
for
this
court
would
be
to
vacate
the
decisions
below
and
to
remand
them
to
let
the
district
court
reconsider
its
decision,
but
i
think
that
the
tenor
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which,
of
course,
was
decided
after
the
wilderness
designation
and
took
account
of
the
wilderness
designation,
is
that
the
wilderness
designation
didn't
make
any
difference.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
fact,
specifically
said
in
its
opinion
that
it
recognized
that
logging
would
become
much
less
significant
because
of
the
wilderness
designation
on
page
9-a
of
the
appendix
to
the
certiorari
petition,
but
it
indicated
that
that
did
not
alter
its
conclusion
that
the
adverse
impact
from
construction
of
the
road
was
sufficient
to
constitute
a
burden
on
free
exercise
rights.
i
guess
that
discussion
is
at
9-a
and
10-a
of
the
opinion.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yeah.
the
8-a
is
a
quote.
that
is
a
quote
of
the
district
court's
finding.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
as
i
say,
the
court
is
certainly
free
to
remand
it.
i
think
that
really
the
basis
of
the
opinions
below
really
was
that
any
interference,
the
road
alone
was
enough,
but
that
the
court--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
there
was.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
don't
want
to
speak
for
the
indian
respondent,
but
i'm
sure
they
can
speak
to
that.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
record
indicates
that
part
of
the
burden
was
at
least
that
the
paved...
the
actual
physical
changing
of
the
landscape
by
paving,
by
having
a
paved
road
there,
and
the
increase
in
traffic,
if
the
court
wants
to
remand
for
reconsideration
to
the
district
court,
that's
certainly
an
option,
although,
as
i
say,
the
court
of
appeals...
the
wilderness
designation
happened
before
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
decision
and
it,
with
that
fact
before
it,
upheld
the
determination
that
there
was
a
burden
on
free
exercise
rights.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
constitutional--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
other
court
of
appeals
decisions
holding
that
land
management
activities--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
courts
of
appeals
really
are
in
a
bit
of
a
disarray
as
to
exactly
what
the
right
legal
approach
is
when
confronted
with
these
questions.
some
courts
have
held
that
an
injunction
in
favor
of
the
indian
religious
claim
would
constitute
an
establishment
of
religion.
other
courts
have
applied
a
test
that
looks
to
whether
the
particular
religious
site...
well,
no,
your
honor,
this
is
the
only
court
that
has
ever...
the
only
court
of
appeals
that
has
ever
come
out
in
favor
of
the
indians.
the
threshold
question
on
the
constitutional
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
construction
of
the
road
and
the
adoption
of
the
management
plan
impose
a
burden
on
the
indians'
rights
that
calls
the
free
exercise
clause
into
play,
and
viewed
from
the
indians'
perspective,
these
government
actions
obviously
have
an
adverse
effect
on
religious
interests.
they
eliminate
the
conditions
necessary
for
effective
spiritual
use
of
an
area
that
is
very
important
to
the
indians'
religion,
but
the
free
exercise
clause
is
not
implicated
whenever
the
government
acts
in
a
manner
that
offends
an
individual's
religious
beliefs.
a
believer's
conclusion
that
government
action
impacts
adversely
upon
his
belief
system
is
not
by
itself
sufficient
to
trigger
constitutional
protection,
and
that
was
really
the
holding
of
this
court
joined
by
eight
members
in
bowen
v.
roy.
the
plaintiffs
in
roy
challenged
the
government's
use
of
the
social
security
number
to
identify
their
daughter
and
they
asserted
that
the
use
of
that
number
would
rob
their
daughter
of
her
spirit
and
prevent
her
from
attaining
greater
spiritual
power,
and
despite
the
undisputed
assertion
that
the
government's
use
of
the
number
would
cause
severe
spiritual
harm
to
the
plaintiffs,
the
court
found
no
burden
on
free
exercise
rights.
we
think
that
roy
makes
clear
that
it's
necessary
to
look
beyond
the
believer's
subjective
assessment
of
the
effect
of
government
action.
some
types
of
government
actions
do
not
infringe
upon
the
constitutional
rights,
even
if
they
have
a
devastating
effect
upon
the
believer's
belief
system.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
under
the
constitution,
because
the
constitution
does
not
require
the
government
to
do
anything,
we
think
that
it's
certainly
appropriate
to
do
exactly
what
the
forest
service
did
in
this
case,
which
is
to
consider
those
interests
heavily,
to
investigate
them
fully,
and
to
take
account
of
them
to
the
greatest
extent
possible,
consistent
with
the
statutory
framework
that
congress
has
set
up,
and
that's
precisely
what
congress
mandated
when
it
enacted
the
american
indian
religious
freedom
act.
what
congress
specifically
did
not
do
and
expressly
did
not
do
was
to
create
an
additional
substantive
right
for
indian
religious
claims
of
this
sort,
and
we
think
that
the
constitution
doesn't
do
that
either.
now,
so,
in
addition
to
the
believer's
claim
that
there
is
subjectively...
that
he
finds
interference
with
his
belief
system,
there
has
to
be
an
objective
element
to
the
government
action.
it
has
to
satisfy
an
objective
test
and
we
think
that
the
court's
decision
in
bowen
v.
roy
sets
forth
what
that
objective
test
is.
in
concluding
that
the
government's
use
of
the
social
security
number
did
not
implicate
the
free
exercise
clause,
the
court
said
that
the
clause
had
not
been
interpreted
to
require
the
government
itself
to
behave
in
ways
that
the
individual
believes
will
further
his
or
her
spiritual
development,
and
the
court
also
observed
that
the
clause
is
written
in
terms
of
what
the
individual
cannot
do...
what
the
government
cannot
do
to
the
individual,
not
in
terms
of
what
the
individual
can
expect
from
the
government.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
don't
think
that's
the
line,
justice
scalia.
i
think
the
line
is
that
in
those
cases,
what
the
government
did
was
put
an
objective
burden
on
the
individual's
choice
about
what
course
of
conduct
he
or
she
was
going
to
pursue.
the
government
put
a
monetary
price
over
choosing
one
alternative
or
the
other,
and
that
is
an
objective
indicia
of
coercion,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
those
opinions.
it
analogized
what
the
government
had
done
by
conditioning
the
benefit
to
direct
coercive
regulation,
and
we
don't
think
that
there's
anything
in
the
land
management
decisions
that
are
at
issue
here
that
has
those
objective
indicia
of
coercion.
it
just
doesn't
say
anything
to
these
individuals
one
way
or
the
other
about
what
they
should
do.
we
think
that's
a
very,
very
important
line
to
draw
in
the
religion
context
because
in
the
religion
clauses...
let
me
start
differently.
most
of
the
protections
of
the
constitution,
such
as
the
free
speech
clause
or
the
fourth
amendment,
protect
objectively-identified
interests.
what
is...
this
court
can
decide
what
is
speech
and
it
can
decide
what
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
are
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment,
but
the
court
cannot
decide
what
religion
is
because
the
constitution
leaves
that
to
each
individual
to
decide
for
himself
or
herself.
the
problem
that
is
really
posed
by
the
free
exercise
clause
is
how
the
clause
can
be
applied
without
sweeping
every
kind
of
government
action
under
its
umbrella
because
an
individual
is
free
to
attach
religious
significance
to
anything
the
government
does
or
anything
the
government
fails
to
do,
and,
so,
if
there's
no
objective
limit
on
what
the
clause
covers,
everything
can
be
converted
into
a
free
exercise
claim
just
by
the
individual
believing
very
sincerely
that
that
action
that
the
government
has
taken
infringes
upon
his
or
her
religious
beliefs.
we
think
that's
why
it's
especially
important
in
this
context
to
make
clear
that
there's
an
additional
objective
standard
that
the
government
actions
have
to
be
measured
against
before
the
free
exercise
clause
protections
are
triggered,
and
that
objective
standard,
i
think,
is
the
distinction
that
the
court
was
driving
at
in
roy.
it's
the
distinction
between
government
interference
with
individual
conduct
on
one
hand
and
individual
control
of
government
action
on
the
other,
and,
really,
what
the
clause
does
is
shield
the
individual
and
his
person
and
his
property
against
government
reaching
in
and
coercively
affecting
his
individual
decisions
about
how
to
order
his
life
and
to
order
his
property,
and
when
the
government
does
that,
either
directly
with
regulation
or
indirectly
by
conditioning
government
benefits
in
a
way
that
has
the
effect
of
regulation,
then
there's
a
free
exercise
violation.
but
if
the
government
doesn't
do
that,
if
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
what
the
individual
should
do
or
what
the
individual
shouldn't
do
with
his
property
or
just
does
something
with
its
own
property,
we
don't
think
that
that's
a
free
exercise
burden
that
calls
the
constitution
into
play.
let
me
just
briefly
say
that
the
contrary
conclusion,
acceptance
of
respondent's
contention,
would
just
work
in
dramatic,
dramatic
effect
upon
the
government's
authority
to
regulate
and
control
its
own
land.
hundreds,
if
not
thousands,
of
indian
sacred
sites
are
located
on
federal
land.
the
boundaries
of
those
sites
are
very
amorphous
and
under
respondent's
theory,
any
action
taken
with
respect
to
those
sites
would
be
subject
to
a
free
exercise
challenge.
the
important
thing
is
that
it's
not
just
indian
claims
because
the
constitution
can't
prefer
indian
claims,
indian
religious
claims
over
other
religious
claims.
any
individual
can
decide
that
any
federal
property
or
any
federal
action
is
significant
to
him
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--there
is
testimony
in
the
record
indicating
the
use
is
quite...
has
been
quite
long,
but,
your
honor,
i
think,--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
don't
think
that
the
record
evidence
goes
back
that
long,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure.
it
certainly
goes
back
to
the
1800s.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
certainly
could
be,
but
let
me
say
that
any
rule
that
makes
the
protections
of
the
free
exercise
clause
depends
on
how
long
a
religion
has
been
in
existence
is
the
very
type
of
government
preference
for
religion
really
that
the
clause
is
specifically
designed
to
prevent.
it
would
elevate
a
traditional
religion
over
a
new
religion
and
give
it
more
protection
against
government
action.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
in
your
hypothetical,--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
but,
your
honor,
in
your
hypothetical,
if
there
were
people
living
on
the
land...
i
assume
that
what
would
happen
is
there
would
be
tenancies
and
people
would
have
a
lease
and
the
lease
would
say
you
can't
build...
i
think
that's
a
very
different
case
because
those
are
people
with
rights
in
the
particular
land.
it
may
be
a
right
that's
limited,
but
i
think
that
that
limitation
might
be
subject
to
constitutional
scrutiny.
but
it's
a
very
different
case,
i
think,
where
there
are
people
who
have
absolutely
no
right
in
the
land,
and
that's
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not
limiting
my
principle
because
my
principle
is
again
this
protection
of
an
individual
and
his
own
resources,
and
part
of
those
resources
would
include
the
property
rights
that
he
has
by
virtue
of
his
agreement
with
the
government.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
you're
right,
your
honor.
that's
probably
the
more
logical
way
to
take
care
of
that
problem,
that
there
would
be
a
discrimination
against
religion.
anyway,
just
to
conclude,
i
think
what's
important
to
note
is
that
this
is
not...
the
claim
that's
asserted
here
is
not
a
claim
that
can
constitutionally
be
limited
to
traditional
indian
religions.
it
really
would
be
a
claim
that
would
be
available
to
anyone.
i
just
want
to
briefly
touch
upon
our
alternative
argument,
that
if
the
court
disagrees
with
our
principal
submission
and
believes
that
there
is
a
cognizable
burden
on
the
free
exercise
of
religion
here,
we
think
that
the
compelling
interest
test
has
to
be
applied
in
a
dramatically
different
way
to
take
account
of
the
very
different
interests
that
are
presented
here.
first,
as
we've
been
discussing,
to
the
extent
that
respondent
has
stated
the
free
exercise
claim,
it's
a
very
different
kind
of
a
claim
than
those
previously
recognized
by
this
court,
and
we
think,
because
it
does
intrude
less
into
individual
autonomy,
is
deserving
of
somewhat
less
protection.
second,
as
the
court
has
recognized
in
the
free
speech
context,
the
government
is
entitled
to
somewhat
more
constitutional
leeway
when
it
acts
in
its
capacity
as
a
landowner,
and
we
think
that
principle
is
especially
weighty
here
because
what
we're
talking
about
is
not
simply
access,
which
is
what
is
at
issue
in
the
public
forum
cases,
but
control
of
the
management
and
the
physical
development
of
the
land
and,
really,
we're
talking
about
using
the
constitution
to
impose
a
much
greater
limitation
on
the
government,
and
we
think
that
when
those
interests
are
factored
together,
the
appropriate
way
for
the
test
to
be
applied
is
to
say
that
the
government's
general
interest
in
managing
its
land,
combined
with
the
particularized
showing
that
the
challenged
decision
is
reasonable,
should
permit
the
government
action
to
go
forward.
we
think
that
that
standard
was
satisfied--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
chief
of
the
forest
service.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
secretary
intends
to
review
that
decision.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no.
this
is
agriculture.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
just
a
few
things,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
with
reference
to
the
american
indian
religious
freedom
act,
as
we
discussed
in
our
reply
brief,
we
don't
believe
that
congress
created
any
substantive
rights
when
it
passed
that
statute.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
about
the
roy
case
and
the
distinction
that
roy
does
not
apply
because
no
practice
was
involved
there.
we
think
that
that's
a
little
bit
of
a
red
herring.
the
only
link
between
what
the
government
has
done
in
the
practice
here,
we
think,
is
the
link
that
respondents
believe
that
their
practices
will
just
not
be
spiritually
effective
anymore.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
are...
there
are
no
findings
of
the
courts
below
that
those
practices
would
be
physically
prevented
by
what
the
government
is
proposing
to
do.
and,
finally,
i'd
like
to
discuss
respondent's
suggestion
that
the
serious
interference
requirement
will
take
care
of
the
line-drawing
problems
that
came
up
in
her
colloquy
with
the
various
members
of
the
court.
we
think
the
problem
with
that
test
is
it's
really
not
an
objective
test.
if
a
religious
believer
asserts
that
a
government
action
has
a
serious
interference
with
his
beliefs
or
with
what
he
wants
to
do,
then
that
acceptance
has
to
be...
that
assertion
has
to
be
accepted
by
the
court.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
we
do.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
the
road
would
not
only
serve...
first
of
all,
it
does
not
only
serve
logging
interests,
it
serves
maintenance
interests
and
recreational
interests.
second
of
all,
it
will
also
provide
a
conduit
for
logging
trucks
from
other
parts
of
this
forest
and
neighboring
forests
to
enable
the
logs
to
get
to
the
mills.
so,
it
still
has
purposes,
and
i
note
that
forty-nine
of
the
fifty-five
miles
have
already
been
built.
anyway,
the
serious
interference
test
is
not
a
real
limitation,
and
a
court
can't
look
behind
what
the
believer
said,
and,
so,
any
believer
can
come
into
court
and
say
just
what
the
hypothetical
posed
by
justice
o'connor,
that
the
entry
of
non-believers
into
the
area
offends,
will
make
their
practices
impossible,
and
the
court
will
have
to
accept
that
and
under
respondent's
theory,
we
submit
that
would
be
a
burden
on
the
free
exercise
of
religion
that
would
require
the
government
to
show
a
compelling
interest.
we
just
don't
think
that
the
free
exercise
clause
stretches
that
far
and
we
think
that
the
court's
decision
in
roy
disposes
of
respondent's
claim
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
as
i
said
earlier,
if
the
court--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
there
might
be
enlightenment,
but
it's
really
only...
it
will
only
be
effective
if
those
changes
will
cause
the
indian
believers
to
withdraw
their
claim
because
if
they
come
into
court
and
say
notwithstanding
the
change,
these
effects
still
burden
our
religion,
the
district
court
and
this
court
will
have
to
accept
that
claim.
it
can't
be
looked
behind.
thank
you.
