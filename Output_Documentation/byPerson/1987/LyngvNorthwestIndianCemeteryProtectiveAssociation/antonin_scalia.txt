that
timber
cutting
can
no
longer
occur,
though.
the
wilderness
designation
made
that
impossible,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
did
that
occur?
that
occurred
after
the
district
court
decision,
but
before
what?
before
we
got
it?
before
the
court
got
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
the
district
court
wouldn't
have
found
the
way
it
did
concerning
the
degree
of
interference
with
the
indians'
religious
observance
had
it
known
that
there
was
not
going
to
be
substantial
logging
operations
in
this
area.
is
it
clear
that
it
would
have
found
that
without
the
timber?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know,
i
think
the
timber...
i
think
logging
is
a
lot
more
intrusive
than
just
a
road,
and
i
wonder
whether
the
district
court
would
have
reached
the
same
result,
just
the
one
and
not
the
both.
you're
not
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
sounds
good,
but
what
do
you
do
about
sherbert,
thomas
and
hobbie,
all
of
which
said
that
the
government
cannot
use
its
money
in
a
way
that
impinges
upon
an
individual's
religious
beliefs.
so,
you
have
to
make
welfare
benefits
available
to
people
who
don't
want
to
work
on
saturday
or
whatever.
why
is
it
any
different
when
you're
talking
about
not
the
government's
money
but
the
government's
land?
is
that
the
constitutional
line
between
money
and
land?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pincus,
how
does
your
theory
apply
to
this
situation?
suppose
the
court
retained
federal
ownership
in
whole
quantities
of
land
which
it
allows
people
to
settle
on
but
it
retains
title,
and
it
simply
adopts
a
rule
that
no
places
of
worship
may
be
built
on
this
federal
land.
now,
that's
just
the
federal
government's
use
of
its
own
land.
it's
not
coercing
anybody
to
do
one
thing
or
another.
do
you
think
that
would
be
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
the
whole
state
of
nevada
were
still
federally
owned
and
that
the
federal
government
just
says
we
just
don't
want
any
churches.
churches
or
other
places
of
worship.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
are
limiting
your
principles.
it's
not
the
government
can
do
anything
with
its
land;
the
government
can
do
anything
with
its
land
so
long
as
it
doesn't
give
individuals
rights
in
the
land?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
miles,
suppose
the
federal
government
were
to
set
aside
a
whole
tract
of
federal
land,
say
this
land
is
dedicated
to
the
use
of
the
mormons
and
no
one
shall
make
any
use
of
this
land
that
would
offend
mormon
beliefs,
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
ask
would
it
be
inappropriate.
would
it
be
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
example
wasn't
one
use
only
but
do
a
lot
of
things,
just
nothing
that
offended
mormons.
justice
antonin
scalia
salt
lake
city,
salt
lake
city.
the
mormons
really
venerate
that
as
a
very
special
place.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
the
state
say
that
henceforth,
salt
lake
city
shall--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
suggest
the
government
could
exclude
citizens
from
that
area
who
would
be
offensive
to
the
indians?
i
mean,--
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
let
somebody
else
build
the
road,
it
would
be
okay.
it's
only
that
they're
building
the
road,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
roy,
certainly
it
was.
the
government
was
giving
this
individual
a
social
security
number
and
circulating
it,
you
know,
throughout
wherever
social
security
numbers
go.
that
was
an
activity
by
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
miles,
out
of
curiosity,
how
numerous
are
these
tribes
or
the
indians
that
practice?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
numerous
are
these
tribes
or
how
numerous
are
the
indians
that
practice
these
rituals?
does
the
record
show
that
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
on
behalf
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
about
a
140
and
the
whole
community
is
how
many?
