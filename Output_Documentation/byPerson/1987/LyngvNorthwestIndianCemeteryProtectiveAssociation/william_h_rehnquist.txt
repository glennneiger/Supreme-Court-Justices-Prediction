justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
for
argument
first
this
morning,
number
86-1013,
richard
e.
lyng
v.
northwest
indian
cemetery
protective
association.
mr.
pincus,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
widmark
v.
vincent
and
that
line
of
cases
prevent
the
government
from
saying
that
we'll
allow
any
sort
of
building
to
be
built
on
these
leased
lands
except
a
church?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
pincus.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
miles.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
record
show,
ms.
miles,
how
many
square
miles
or
square
feet
there
are
involved
or
how
long
a
trail
in
miles
or
yards
of
progression
would
be?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
area
again?
is
it
in
square
miles
or
linear
miles
or
linear
feet?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
17,000
acres?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
just
didn't
happen.
the
jeep
trail
had
to
be
built,
didn't
it?
i
mean,
the
jeep
trail
is
a
prehistoric
existing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
had
to
be
substantially
graded,
i
would
think,
to
make
it
a
jeep
trail.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it
were,
i
take
it
that
you
would
think
the
same
result
should
be.
if
the
indians
said
the
building
of
these
overnight
cabins
also
offends
our
traditional
religion,
you
would
think
the
results
should
be
the
same.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
miles.
mr.
pincus,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
the
case
is
submitted.
