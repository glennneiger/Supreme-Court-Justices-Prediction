ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
while
i
will
be
addressing
two
specific
points
this
morning,
i
would
first
like
to
clarify
some
of
the
factual
discussion
that
preceded
my
presentation.
i
think
it's
first
important
to
realize
that
it
is
one
site
in
regards
to
whether
or
not
the
government
action
is
actually
occurring
on
the
site.
it's
one
site
that
the
record
shows
is
used
in
a
general
sense.
different
trails
are
used.
people
progress
from
one
focal
point
to
another,
but
it
is
not
like
different
pews
in
a
church.
it's
one
area
and
you
go
from,
for
example,
from
chimney
rock,
you
have
to
travel
to
the
other
area,
and
it
isn't
that
they're
independent
and
you
can
say
you
didn't
destroy
this
pew
and
you
didn't
destroy
this
one.
i
think
it's
clear
to
understand
that
the
record
establishes
one
area,
one
generalized
use,
and
a
particular
pattern
of
religious
conduct
that
requires
a
progression--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--the
court...
yeah.
i
think
the
record
does,
your
honor,
yes.
in
terms
of
evidence
was
established
as
to
what
constitutes
this
one
area,
and
admittedly
it's
a
large
area
in
this
particular
instance,
principally
because
geographically--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
where
the
government
action
is
occurring
and
what
conduct
is
it
impacting.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
right.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
not
necessarily.
having
it
occurred...
sacredness,
yes.
yes.
that
bothers
and
seriously
goes
against
what
they
believe,
but
what
we're
proposing
here
is
not
that
that's
the
test
at
all
or
the
idea
that
it's
disturbing
the
sacredness,
but
you've
got
the
road
going
between
particular
sites
where
religious
activity
has
to
go
through.
so,
you
have
to
look
at
where
the
conduct
is
occurring
and
where
the
government
action
is
occurring,
although
any
intrusion
in
there
does
offend
them,
but
that's
not
the
position,
that's
not
what
the
court
below
held
in
terms
of
what
you
look
at.
you
look
at
the
serious
impact
that
the
activity
will
have
on
the
conduct.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
yeah.
i
think
it
boils
down
to
around...
well,
about
13,500
was
put
into
the
district
and
17,000
is
what
the
forest
service
has
reached.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
square...
no.
acres.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
yes.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
it's
made
up
in
terms
of
a
geographic
area.
it's
the
acreage
that
comes
from
the
fact
that
you
have
a
multitude
of
religious
areas
and
that's
why
it
became
a
national
district
because
it
is
so
different
than--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--no,
your
honor,
and
that
claim
has
never
been
made
in
this
case.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
certainly
not
to
the
degree
that
the
road
does.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
it
would--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--it
would
to
some
degree,
your
honor.
but
we
are
not
claiming.
that
is
not
a
request
for
the
relief
here,
and--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--we
don't
believe
that
if
you
adopt
the
test
that
is
used
by
the
9th
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit
and
the
6th
circuit
that
that
would
necessarily
establish
a
claim.
it
is
a
very
narrow
one.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
if--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--you
could
show
that
there
was
serious
interference
of
the
nature
that
is
shown
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
you
could
in
the
facts
that
you
propose,
your
honor.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
your
honor,
the
unpaved
road
as
the
record
shows
is
a
jeep
trail,
very
rarely
used.
while
it
could
have
some
impact
on
it,
it
is
not
used
the
same
way
that
this
two-lane
paved
road
with
eighty-four
logging
trucks
would
be
used.
it
was
used
primarily
for
administrative
purposes
once
in
awhile.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
excuse
me?
what?
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
well,
certainly
not
to
the
extent
perhaps
because
the
wilderness
bill
has
affected
that,
but
the--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the
assumption
is
correct
that
this
road
by
itself,
which
will
have
some
traffic
or
else
i
don't
know
why
the
forest
service
would
be
planning
to
build
this
road
if
it
wasn't
going
to
be
used
by
anybody,
it
seems
to
be
not
much
of
a
purpose,
but
what
i
would
like
to
explain
is
what
i
tried
to
clarify
before,
that
you've
got
practitioners,
religious
practitioners,
under
the
tenets
of
their
religion
traveling
from
the
doctor
rock
area
and
if
you
understand
the
particular
types
of
activities
that
they
undertake,
it's
getting
into
trance-like
states.
it's
a
conduct
that's
different
than
most
practices,
and
they
have
to
journey
across
to
chimney
rock,
which
is
up
above
on
the
other
side
of
the
road.
just
having
the
road
there
will
take
them
out
of
being
able
to
have
that
practice.
when
you
come
across
the
road
and
it
just
is
a
physical
interference
and
you
have
to
stop
and
look
to
see
if
there
are
trucks
coming
right
now
or
it
just
physically
interferes
with
their
ability
to
continue
what
has
been
going
on
for
hundreds
of
years
in
that
area.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
the
unpaved
road,
your
honor,--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--the
amount
of
traffic
partly,
is
partly
it.
the
other
thing
would
come
into
the
belief
system
with
regards
to
the
fact
that
the
road
is
a
natural
road.
it
is
a
dirt
road
that
is
very
rarely
used
and
it's
just
part
of
that
natural
environment.
it
is
totally
different
than
a
road--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--it
used
to
be
a
trail,
an
indian
trail.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
it
has
been
somewhat
improved,
your
honor.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
i
think
that
would
be
inappropriate,
but
what
i
think
you're--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--it
would
run
most
likely
afoul
of
the
establishment
clause,
but
what
i'd
like
to
clarify,
there
is
no
set-aside
in
this
area.
this
is
not
a
set-aside.
the
government
is
attempting
to
say
that
there's
some
kind
of
one
use
only
by
the
indian
people
and
that
is
not
true.
we
have,
in
fact,
in
this
very
case,
there
are
more
non-indian
plaintiffs
who
use
the
area.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
well,
this
is...
if
they
showed
that
that
area
was
central
and
indispensable,
that
is
the
only
place
in
that
particular--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--yes,
but--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--no,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
the
9th
circuit
rule
does.
you
have
to
take
a
look
at
what
you're
doing,
you
have
to
show
factually
that
the
particular
area
where
the
government
action
is
occurring...
it
isn't
a
set-aside.
there's
got
to
be
an
action
that
is
interfering
with
the
ability,
seriously
interfering
with
the
ability
to
carry
on
a
practice
in
a
particular
area,
and
your
factual
setting
doesn't
have
any
of
those
factors,
your
honor.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
i
shouldn't
say
that.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
no,
that's
not
correct.
other
people
do
use
the
area.
it
is
a
very
rugged
area.
it's
a
wilderness
area.
there
are
people
that
use
it.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
that's
true,
your
honor.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
no.
the
number
of
people...
if
you
knew
the
geography
and...
you're
really
talking
about
a
place
that
people
don't
go
to
much.
it's
a
very
remote
place.
that's
why
the
indian
people
chose
it
partly
so
far
away
from
the
reservation,
you
know,
where
they
live
along
the
river.
it's
because
it's
an
area
that
it
just
a
remote
rugged
area
that
people
do
not
utilize
on
the
way
that
we
would
think
of
recreationally.
so,
in
that
area,
once
in
awhile,
there
will
be
people
and
that
would
have
some
interference,
but
it
is
not
of
the
impact
of
what
the
government
proposes
in
this
case.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
no,
that
is
not
a
part
of
this
case.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
yes,
but
it
may
be
a
burden
that
we
would
have
no
relief
for
in
a
sense.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
i'm
sorry?
excuse
me?
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
we
say
that
the
government
cannot
undertake
certain
actions
that
would
have
the
effect
of--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--no,
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
and
cut
the
trees
down
as
proposed?
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
we
say
that
that
would
interfere
with
the
conduct
of
religious
practices
occurring
there.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
the
government...
we
are
asking
the
government
itself
not
to
take
an
act
that
will
take
away
from
these
people
a
religious
practice
that
has
been
occurring.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
no,
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
management
plan,
what
you're
talking
about
is
not
all
of
that
area
was
going
to
be
logged.
that
area
is
a
multiple
use
area.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
it
is
excluding
the
government
from
undertaking
certain
types
of
activities
in
that
area.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
we
say
that
the
free
exercise
clause,
when
you
show
it
in
an
area,
the
only
place
that
you
could
practice
your
religion
under
the
tenets
of
your
religion,--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--and
that
the
government's
act...
it
would
be
spread
out
to
other...
it
is
not
that
it
is
aimed
at
loggers,
that
the
government
action
that
is
proposed
when
you
show
that
it's
going
to
seriously
impact
the
physical
ability
to
carry
on
your
practice,
we
submit
the
government
cannot
do
that
to
these
people.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
not
necessarily.
that
may
not
be
the
serious
interference
that
the
court
found
below.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
address--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--your
honor,
not
that
it
offends
them.
if
we
could
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
whatever
that
government
activity
is,
seriously
interferes
with
the
ability
to
conduct
the
practice...
this
is
not
just
a
belief
case.
while
belief
is
part
of
it,
you
can't
separate
out.
it's
physical
interference
with
the
ability
to
conduct
practices
in
an
area
where
they
have
been
conducting
them
long
before
the
federal
government
even
came
into
existence.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
that
would
be
a
factual
determination
that--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--i
think
what
we're
saying
is
when
the
government
is
undertaking
its
action,
that
it's
taking
away
from
the
ability
to
exercise
your
religion.
that
is
different
than
when
you
are
affirmatively
asking
them
to
do
something.
it
may
be
a
slight
distinction,
but
we're
asking
that
the
government
itself--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--no,
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
again,
if,
under
a
factual
showing,
you
showed
that
that
seriously
interfered
with
the
practice,
then
the
problem
is
there
may
be
no
remedy
for
some
of
that
because
you
would
then
be
affirmatively
asking
for
the
government
to
take
action.
we're
not.
we're
saying
in
this
very
limited
circumstance,
do
not
take
action
that
takes
away
from
the
indians.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
again,
i
think
there
would
be...
there
may
be
a
burden
but
no
remedy
for
the
indian
people
when
it
comes
to
doing
affirmative...
requesting
that
type
of
affirmative
relief.
your
honor,...
excuse
me?
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
not
at
all,
your
honor,
and
that
was
my
first
point.
that
this
case
is
not
bowen
v.
roy,
that
unlike
roy,
you
have
here
government
action
directly
reaching
out
where
a
religious
conduct
is
occurring,
and
the
only
place
that
it
can--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--and
i
don't
quarrel
with
that.
this
is
not
just
of
that
belief.
you've
got
the
government
taking
action
that
interferes
with
the
actual
practice,
conduct.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
i
don't
think
activities
was
involved
in
there
at
all,
your
honor.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
no.
i
am
speaking
about
the
believer's
activity.
i'm
sorry.
that
there...
in
that
case,
you
had
a
subjective
thing.
here,
you've
got
actual
physical
conduct.
there
was
no
nexus
with
practice
in
that
case
at
all
in
the
opinion
and
here
you've
got
actual
conduct
that
is
being
interfered
with
by
the
government
act,
and
it's
not
an
internal
act,
such
as
that
that
was
found
in
roy,
but
it
is
an
act
that
is
occurring.
a
road-building
out
on
public
land
is
not
of
the
same
nature
of
act
as
was
found
in
roy.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
what
is
happening
in
this
case,
your
honor,
which
is
equally
serious,
is
that
these
practices
go
to
the
very
core
of
the
religion
for
a
substantially-large
number
of
people,
and
if
they
cannot
be
conducted,
if
they
have
that
same
type
of
belief,
but
you
physically
would
be
terminating
this
particular
religion
for
these
people
by
allowing
the
government
act
out
in
a
very
public
way,
not
in
any
sense
the
way
it
is
in
the
roy
case.
your
honor,
we
do
admit
that
this
case
is
different
than
the
other
cases,
but
i
think
there
has
been
a
principled
way
that
the
court
has
approached
free
exercise
cases,
and
that
is
by
looking
in
each
particular
case
whether
or
not
the
particular
act
that
is
being
questioned
is
intended
to
interfere
or
has
the
effect
of
interfering
with
the
ability
to
practice
their
religion.
ms.

b.
miles
construction
of
the
chimney
rock
section
of
the
road.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
paving
this
two-lane
road,
building
that
road.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
well,
i
suppose
you
have
to
ask
the
government,
but
my
understanding
is
that
the...
although
the
trial
court
made
very
specific
findings
about
the
interest
that
would
be
advanced,
was
to
increase
some
access
for
the
area
and--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--well,
it
was
not
wilderness
at
the
time
the
road
was
proposed,
your
honor.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
but
the
trial
court
specifically
found
that
there
is
all
the
access
that
one
needs
to
get
to
that
particular
area.
so,
that
was
a
factual
finding
that
had
been
made
in
this
case.
if
you
adopt
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case,
it
would
mean
that
native
american
site-specific
practices,
which
congress
has
expressly
recognized
in
the
american
indian
religious
freedom
act,
will
receive
no
constitutional
protection
when
the
government
is
physically
planning
an
act
that
prevents
these
types
of
practices
from
continuing.
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
if
the
first
amendment
means
anything,
it
means
that
the
government
cannot
take
away
the
very
ability
of
an
individual
to
practice
his
religion
at
the
only
place
that
it
can
be
practiced
under
the
tenets
of
their
religion.
if,
indeed,
you
protect
all
religions
under
the
constitution,
then
this
type
of
site-specific
religion
is
entitled
to
protection
when
it
is
seriously
threatened
by
governmental
action.
ms.
marilyn
b.

we
feel
that
that
does
provide
substantive
rights
and
it
also
provides
the
understanding
of
what
congress--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--well,
we
think
it's
a
cause
of
action
that
this
case
could
turn
on,
that
it
is
a
substantive
right
that
has
been
violated
in
this
case.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
excuse
me?
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
yes.
the
record
does
show
that,
and
approximately
the
trial
court's
findings
that
probably
a
100
to
a
140
people
physically
are
undertaking
the
rituals
on
behalf
of
a
larger
community
of
about
4500
religious
adherents.
the
tribes
themselves
are--
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
--well,
much
as
a
priest
does
it
on
behalf
of
the
larger
communities,
the
people
that
go
there
do
it
on
behalf
of
more
than
themselves.
they
are
the
spiritual
leaders
that
do
this
on
behalf
of
the
religious
community.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
no.
there
are
about
a
140
that
physically
go
there
and
undertake
these
practices
on
behalf
of
a
larger
religious
community
which
is
approximately
4500.
now,
as
to
the
indian
people
over
all,
if
that
was
your
question,
there's
about
10,000
involved.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
your
honor,
we
don't
contend
that
the
right
to
practice
the
religion
here
is
absolute,
but
only
that
it
is
subject
to
the
same
balancing
of
interests
that
is
the
touchstone
of
the
first
amendment,
when
you
have
shown
a
serious
interference
with
the
ability
to
practice
and
a
threat
to
the
religion
itself.
i
would
next
like
to
talk
about
what
the
court
below,
the
specific
rule
that
is
used
by
the
9th
circuit,
that
has
been
used
also
by
the
d.c.
circuit
and
the
6th
circuit,
and
it
requires
that
before
you
have
a
cause
of
action,
that
the
respondent
must
show
that
the
particular
area
where
the
government's
action
is
going
to
occur
is
central
and
indispensable;
that
is,
they
cannot
practice
this
anywhere
else,
and
that
the
action
will
seriously
impair
the
ability
to
conduct
these
practices.
only
then
is
the
government
required
to
show
a
compelling
state
interest
that
can't
otherwise
be
served.
the
courts
specifically
held
that
showing
that
the
area
was
sacred
was
not
enough.
that
would
be
the
roy
notion
as
far
as
we
can,
you
know,
believe.
secondly,
showing
that
the
area
is
used
for
religious
purposes,
that
is
not
enough.
you've
got
to
show
that
it's
the
only
area
that
this
can
occur
under
the
tenets
of
the
religion
and
that
the
government
act
will,
in
fact,
seriously
interfere
with
the
ability
to
conduct
the
practices
at
that
area.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
proper
balancing
test
for
what
has
been
shown
to
be
a
very
serious
infringement
on
the
religious
rights
of
a
large
number
of
people
and
would
for
other
native
americans
who
practice
similar
religions,
and
that
it
sufficiently
insulates
the
government
from
claims
of
this
nature
and
would
require
only
when
those
very
unique
factors
come
together.
i
wanted
to
clarify
that.
it
does
no
good
to
say
there's
a
thousand
sites
because
that
has
no
meaning
whatsoever.
one
has
got
to
look
at
the
site
being
used,
is
it
being
used
for
religious
purposes,
is
the
government's
action
occurring
where
the
particular
practice
has
to
occur,
and,
so,
that's
a
scare
tactic
that
has
no
meaning
when
you
look
at
it
in
terms
of
a
factual
case-by-case
determination.
history,
in
fact,
the
cases
show
that
while
the
courts
have
said
that
indians
do
have
first
amendment
rights
on
those
lands,
it
should
be
respected.
factually,
the
claims
are
very
difficult
to
sustain.
not
all
claims,
as
i've
noted,
will
be
found
to
be
religious,
as
in
sequoyah
v.
tva.
there
was
no
use
being
made
of
that
area.
not
all
religious
practices
have
to
be
conducted
at
the
particular
site,
and,
so,
it
would
not
interfere
with
the
government's
proposal
at
all
unless
you
could
show
that,
and
not
all
land
projects
are
going
to
seriously
interfere
with
it,
your
honor.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
we
do
not
quarrel
with
that
test.
we
accept
that
test.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
yes,
we
do.
ms.
marilyn
b.
miles
and
we
feel
that
the...
well,
to
lessen
the
protection,
the
constitutional
protection
for
what
are
core
religious
practices
and
religious
freedom
here
would
be
contrary
to
the
whole
notion
that
the
bill
of
rights
does
protect
this
type
of
practice
from
governmental
action.
in
conclusion,
respondent
submits
that
the
rule
used
by
the
court
below
strikes
a
proper
balance
and
that
the
other
circuit
courts
have
felt
rather
than
just
throwing
this
religion
totally
out
on
the
streets,
that
this
was
one
way
of
meeting
both
concerns,
and
we
feel
that
it
is
an
appropriate
way
that
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
