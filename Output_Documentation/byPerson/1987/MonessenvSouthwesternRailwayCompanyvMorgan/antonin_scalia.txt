justice
scalia
i
presume
you
would
also
argue
that
the
state
rule
is
not
really
designed
to
punish
for
not
making
settlement
offer,
but
rather
the
rule
is
designed
to
provide
prejudgment
interest
and
however
there
is
a
dispensation
for
someone
who
has
been
good
enough
to
make
a
settlement
offer?
i
mean,
it's
hard
to
say
whether
you're
punishing
the
failure
to
make
one
or
rewarding
the
making
of
one.
justice
scalia
you
should
make
that
argument
to
congress
when
it
enacted
the
fela.
i
mean,
congress
did
make
that
judgment,
didn't
it?
justice
scalia
in
general,
you
mean
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
that's
what
you're
addressing
now,
you
think?
right?
justice
scalia
mr.
hollander,
suppose
you
decide
to
eliminate
congestion
instead
of
by
providing
prejudgment
interest
where
there
hasn't
been
a
proper
settlement
offer,
suppose
you
decide
to
do
it
by
simply
increasing
the
damages?
you
say
in
all
actions
in
this
state,
the
damage
award
will
be
increased
50
percent
when
there
has
been
no
settlement
offer
of
75
percent
of
the
jury
award.
does
that
mean
that
we
would
follow
that
rule
in
federal
cases
as
well
because
the
objective
is
a
procedural
one
and
therefore
it's
all
right,
we
increase
the
damages
fifty
percent?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
ask
whether
it
would
be
reasonable.
i
asked
whether
you
would
consider
that
the
kind
of
a
rule
under
our
erie
holdings
that
could
be
applied,
or
analogously
to
our
erie
holdings,
whether
that's
the
kind
of
a
rule
that
would
be
applied
to
fela
cases?
justice
scalia
well,
change
the
amount.
my
point
is
if
you
are
avowedly
are
increasing
the
damages,
but
your
purpose
in
increasing
them
is
to
reduce
congestion,
does
that
mean
that
it's
okay
as
far
as
federal
courts
adopting
it
is
concerned?
justice
scalia
no,
i
mean
as
far
as
this
federal
court
receiving
an
appeal
from
the
courts
doing
that,
from
the
state
courts
doing
that?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
the
state
courts
could
apply
that
rule
and
increase
fela
damages
a
certain
percentage
so
long
as
their
purpose
in
increasing
the
damages
is
to
eliminate
congestion
in
state
courts?
justice
scalia
it's
the
same
purpose.
you're
saying
in
order
to
end
their
congestion,
they
can
reverse
a
federal
rule
of
no
prejudgment
interest,
but
in
order
to
decrease
their
congestion,
they
can't
reverse
a
federal
rule
of
prejudgment.
why?
