justice
kennedy
counsel,
assume
that
we
adopted
the
federal
rule
that
there
would
be
prejudgment
interest.
could
the
railroad
then
avoid
it
by
tendering
the
offer
under
the
pennsylvania
rule?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
you're
saying
it's
a
federal
rule
if
there's
interest
but
not
a
federal
rule
if
there's
no
interest?
justice
kennedy
all
right,
suppose
we
say
you're
right.
what
happens
under
the
pennsylvania
rule
if
the
railroad
tenders
an
offer
and
the
offer
is
rejected?
justice
kennedy
could
the
pennsylvania
courts
encourage
settlement
by
saying
that
prejudgment
interest
would
not
apply
in
that
event?
justice
kennedy
i
don't
see
how
that's
any
different
than
the
case
before
us.
