justice
stevens
mr.
manion,
in
this
case,
who
decided
on
the
prejudgment
interest?
that
wasn't
the
jury
that
did
that,
was
it?
justice
stevens
it
wasn't
characterized
then
as
an
element
of
the
damages?
justice
stevens
and
how
did
the
judge
decide
on
the
ten
percent
rate?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
mr.
manion,
did
any
of
those
cases
involve
the
peculiar
wrinkle
we
have
in
this
case
of
a
separate
rule
that
provides
that
this
can
be
done
as
a
remedy
for
failing
to
make
a
high
enough
settlement
offer?
justice
stevens
but
particularly
to
any
of
them
involve
state
court
rules
that
are
dealing
with
the
subject
of
trying
to
motivate
settlement
offers?
justice
stevens
supposing
the
state
rule,
instead
of
having
a
prejudgment
interest
as
a
remedy
for
failing
to
make
settlement
offer
provided
that
say
it
would
be
double
costs
of
a
thousand
dollar
flat
one
percent
of
the
judgment.
you'd
making
the
same
argument
on
such
a
rule,
wouldn't
you?
is
the
fact
that
it's
prejudgment
interest
i'm
not
sure
is
as
important
as
whether
there
can
be
any
remedy
in
an
fela
procedure
for
failing
to
make
settlement
offers
that
would
not
normally
be
allowed
in
federal
court,
but
is
allowed
in
all
state
proceedings.
and
double
costs
is
one
that
occurs
to
me.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
leave
it
the
same.
he
failed
to
make
a
settlement
offer
of
at
least
75
percent
of
the
verdict.
justice
stevens
and
they
couldn't
do
anything
of
that
kind?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question.
this
case
was
tried
before
pfeifer
was
decided.
the
case
took
a
long
time
to
get
here,
it
seems
to
me.
it
was
tried
in
1981,
was
it?
justice
stevens
how
much
of
the
appellate
proceedings
were
post-pfeifer?
justice
stevens
were
post-pfeifer.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
you'd
have
a
one-way
discount
if
you
just
used
the
table
without
any
offset
for
inflation?
justice
stevens
of
course,
that
wasn't
really
debated,
was
it?
