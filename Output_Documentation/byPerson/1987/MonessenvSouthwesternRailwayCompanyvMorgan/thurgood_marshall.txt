mr.
hollander,
how
many
states
have
a
statute
like
this?
justice
marshall
i
don't
mean
just
interest.
i
mean,
like
this
statute?
justice
marshall
well,
did
you
do
any
research
to
find
out
if--
justice
marshall
--like
this
one?
justice
marshall
so
now
we're
going
to
have
fifty
of
them?
justice
marshall
we're
going
to
have
fifty
of
them,
right?
right?
justice
marshall
well,
you
could,
couldn't
you?
justice
marshall
that's
what
i
said,
each
state
could
do
a
different
one?
justice
marshall
that's
a
little
different.
justice
marshall
could
pennsylvania
pass
a
rule
that
applies
only
to
fela
cases?
justice
marshall
they
couldn't
do
that,
could
they?
justice
marshall
no
question
about
it.
justice
marshall
so
if
they
wanted
to
get
to
the
fela
cases,
all
they'd
have
to
do
is
pass
a
general
statute.
justice
marshall
do
you
think
that
congress
meant
that?
justice
marshall
do
you
think
congress
meant
that?
