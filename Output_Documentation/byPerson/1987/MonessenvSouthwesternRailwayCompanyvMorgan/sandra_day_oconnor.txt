justice
o'connor
mr.
manion,
do
you
plan
to
discuss
the
total
offset
damages
issue
at
all?
justice
o'connor
and
in
that
regard,
may
i
inquire
whether
at
trial
there
was
any
effort
on
the
part
of
your
client
to
establish
a
technically
more
accurate
method--
justice
o'connor
--than
the
total
offset
method?
justice
o'connor
i
didn't
find
anything
to
indicate
that
you
established
that
that
was
a
better
method
than
the
total
offset
method.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
it's
open
to
the
court
to
select
any
reasonable
method?
justice
o'connor
we
held
that
it
was
in
pfeifer.
justice
o'connor
yes.
but
do
you
think
there's
anything
in
our
cases
that
indicates
that
the
choice
of
a
method
of
calculation
of
damages
which
is
a
legal
question
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
the
method
of
calculating
damages
was
one
for
the
court.
justice
o'connor
well,
once
the
method
is
selected,
then
the
factual
question
and
its
application
goes
to
the
jury.
i
just
couldn't
really
imagine
how
you
got
the
proposition
that
the
jury
should
determine
the
method?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
jury
was
not
instructed
that
it
had
to
make
a
reduction
or
that
it
had
t
calculate
present
worth.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
suppose
that
dickerson
requires
at
least
that
the
jury
be
told
they
have
to
base
damages
on
present
worth?
