mr.
thomas
hollander
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we're
considering
here
today
the
application
to
a
remedial
statute,
the
federal
employers
liability
act
of
two
of
what
have
become
the
most
important
cornerstones
in
the
past
decade
of
the
civil
practice
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
rule
238
about
which
there's
already
been
some
discussion,
and
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
decision
in
kaczkowski
v.
bolubasz
which
has
straightened
up,
at
least
for
the
time
being,
some
very
curious
developments
in
how
we
reduce
verdicts
for
impairment
of
earning
capacity
and
other
future
payments
to
present
value.
i
can't
help
but
make
this
comment,
that
rule
238
being
designed
to
reduce
congestion
and
delay
which
was
the
avowed
purpose
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
promulgating
it,
if
my
colleague
for
the
railroad
is
correct,
may
do
more
to
reduce
the
backlog
in
federal
court
because
it
will
attract
litigants
down
grant
street
to
the
state
court
where
their
possibility
of
getting
rule
238
exists.
but
nonetheless,
it's
the
kind
of
rule...
about
which
i'll
speak
later...
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
should
be
permitted
to
promulgate
to
deal
with
the
matter
of
the
disposition
of
the
cases
in
its
system.
i
would
like
to
first
however
discuss
the
total
offset
method
that
was
used
to
reduce
the
verdict
in
this
case
to
present
worth.
the
trial
court
tried
this
case
in
1981.
for
a
long
period
of
time,
since
this
court's
decision
in
chesapeake
&
ohio
v.
kelly
in
1916,
announcing
that
future
payments
in
fela
cases,
and
for
that
matter,
it
has
affected
the
fabric
of
all
litigation
involving
future
payments
and
especially
personal
injury
litigation,
must
be
reduced
to
present
value.
this
court
in
1916
expressly
did
not
lay
down
a
precise
rule
or
formula
for
how
that
reduction
was
to
take
place.
and
said
it
was
not
its
purpose
to
do
so.
thereafter
then
until
the
decision
of
this
court
through
justice
stevens
in
1983
in
the
pfeifer
case,
a
period
of
67
years,
the
state
courts
and
the
federal
courts
across
this
country
used
a
wide
variety
of
methods
to
reduce
future
impairment
of
earning
capacity
to
present
value,
all
with
at
least
the
tacit
approval
of
this
court,
because
this
court
let
that
go
on
for
67
years,
and,
i
submit,
should
continue
to
let
it
go
on
because
we're
talking
about
methods
of
proof
and
how
you
handled
methods
of
proof,
evidentiary
questions
in
trial
courts.
in
1980,
in
this
context,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
said
that
they
wanted
this
evidentiary
rule
based
on
the
theory
that
the
market
interest
rate
offsets
the
inflation
rate
and
that
therefore
we
will
consider
those
totally
offset
and
those
issues
will
not
be
entertained
for
evidentiary
purposes,
and
that
proposal
will
not
be
submitted
to
the
jury
that
the
reduction
to
present
worth
will
have
taken
effect
in
that
way.
that
was
to
remedy
an
inequity
that
has
been
pointed
out
in
a
number
of
the
circuit
courts
to
which
the
appellant
refers
in
which
we
had
a
situation
where
you
could
not
introduce
inflationary
evidence
at
all
and
still
had
a
discount
to
present
worth
which
was
essentially
a
double
discount
for
the
defendant.
and
i
should
add,
all
of
this
is
in
the
context
of
what
i
submit
is
an
economically
inequitable
process
where
you
get
nothing
for
delay
in
an
fela
case
under
ordinary
circumstances,
and
when
all
rules
of
the
court
are
complied
with,
up
through
until
the
time
of
trial
even
though
economic
loss
has
occurred,
but
that
future
damages
are
discounted,
which
is
an
economically
inequitable
circumstance.
mr.
thomas
hollander
well,
your
honor,
i'm
glad
you
raised
that,
because
congress...
and
we're
talking
now
about
prejudgment
interest,
i
take
it,
is
what
your
question
is...
congress
said
nothing
about
prejudgment
interest.
and
in
an
inference
that
a
court
made
many
many
years
ago,
and
not
this
court,
the
inference
was
that
congress'
silence
in
1908
meant
there
would
be
no
prejudgment
interest
permitted.
in
1908,
there
was
neither
prejudgment
nor
post-judgment
interest
in
this
country,
as
i
read
these
cases.
so
the
fact
that
there
was
no
interest
at
all
mentioned
was
deemed
therefore
without
any
discussion
nor
reference
to
the
congressional
record,
it's
questionable
whether
congress
considered
it
at
all.
but
what
congress
did
consider
at
that
time,
and
an
examination
of
the
congressional
record
will
show...
and
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court...
and
it's
not
in
my
brief,
but
i
will
read
it
into
the
argument...
congressional
record
60th
congress
first
session,
vol.
42
in
1908,
at
pages
4527
to
4550,
discussed
the
reasons
for
granting
concurrent
jurisdiction.
justice
holmes
in
1916,
which
was
apparently
a
banner
year
for
litigation
in
this
court
for
fela
cases,
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
congress
was
to
anticipate...
i'll
give
you
his
words,
which
i
think
are
pertinent
here...
"that
congress
contemplated
suits
in
state
courts
and
accepted
state
procedures
in
advance.
"
in
that
case
there
was
a
question
about
a
lien
on
an
fela
claim
by
a
local
lawyer
and
the
question
that
there
couldn't
be
a
lien
because
congress
hadn't
allowed
it.
oddly
enough,
about
that
same
time,
this
court
affirmed
a
state
court
addition
of
ten
percent
in
an
fela
case
in
an
appeal
because
the
appeal
was
affirmed
and
the
defendant
had
to
add
ten
percent
to
the
award
on
that
basis
which
is
coincidentally
the
same
interest
rate
we're
talking
about
here.
congress
was
concerned
when
it
granted
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
access
of
injured
railroaders
to
the
courts
in
1908
and
the
sizes
of
the
federal
districts
and
the
circuits,
the
question
of
how
far
people
had
to
travel,
how
they'd
get
their
witnesses
to
court
if
it
were
a
federal
court
matter,
and
whether
that
imposed
a
great
burden
on
the
litigant.
and
congress
considered
and
determined
not
to
grant
removal
powers
to
a
defendant
in
an
fela
case
because
of
the
costs
and
the
denial
of
adequate
access
to
the
courts.
that
was
in
1908.
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
at
this
time
in
1988,
the
denial
to
access
of
the
litigants
injured
in
railroad
cases
and
in
any
other
cases
to
the
courts,
is
now
the
delay
and
congestion
that's
occurring
which
is
equally
significant
to
the
costs
that
would
be
incurred
in
the
long
distance
travels
and
the
transportation
and
hiring
of
lawyers
in
two
or
more
locations
in
1908.
in
short,
the
economic
burdens
that
are
placed
on
the
plaintiffs
now
in
the
delays
means
that
their
verdicts
are
less
valuable
and
have
less
meaning
and
are
more
costly
in
personal
loss
over
the
long
run
than
they
would
be
with
the
use
of
prejudgment
interest.
so
i
think
that
congress
has
actually
spoken
to
this
issue,
but
not
talking
about
interest,
talking
about
access
to
the
courts.
and
that
because
this
court
has
said
that
the
fela
is
a
dynamic
statute
to
be
liberally
construed
and
in
the
words
of
the
kernan
decision,
not
a
static
remedy
but
one
enlarged
and
developed
to
meet
changing
conditions
and
concepts
over
a
period
of
time,
suggests
clearly
that
this
is
not
a
congressional
matter.
congress
remains
silent
on
interest.
it
remains
silent
on
damages.
the
courts
have--
mr.
thomas
hollander
--your
honor,
if
you're
referring
to
whether
the
rule
for
238
prejudgment
interest
applies?
mr.
thomas
hollander
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
i
would
like
to
comment
on
with
regard
to
that,
because
we're
really
talking
about
the
uniformity
of
the
application
of
the
fela
across
the
country.
and
what
in
effect
happens
if
a
prejudgment
interest
rule
occurs
and
if
that
impacts
on
the
formula.
there
are
because
of
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
this
statute,
a
number,
a
wide
variety
of
things
that
effect
uniformity.
up
until
the
amendment
of
the
section
1961
of
the
code,
all
post-judgment
interest
in
federal
courts
were
controlled
by
state
rules.
that
varied
a
great
deal.
verdict
sizes
vary
from
region
to
region.
jury
sizes
vary
from
district
court
to
state
court.
the
nature
of
the
verdicts,
whether
they're
a
majority
or
whether
they're
five-sixths,
or
unanimous
varies.
present
worth
calculations
have
varied
from
time
to
time.
pleadings
are
different,
provisions
are
different.
does
rule
238
really
create
a
disparity
in
the
treatment
of
fela
claimants?
and
my
response
to
that
is
not
unlike
what
i
was
trying
to
get
to
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question.
and
that
is
this.
prejudgment
interest
is
a
just
economic
concept.
the
earlier
that
a
defendant
pays
a
verdict
of
judgment,
the
more
expensive
it
is
for
the
defendant
and
the
better
it
is
for
the
claimant.
the
later
in
time
that
a
defendant
is
required
to
pay
a
verdict
or
judgment
in
an
fela
case,
the
less
expensive
it
is--
mr.
thomas
hollander
--your
honor,--
mr.
thomas
hollander
--well,
let
me
make
this
comment
with
regard
to
that
question.
there
are
two
issues
that
we
seem
to
be
addressing
here
with
regard
to
rule
238
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
one
is
whether
prejudgment
interest
is
an
acceptable
award
in
an
fela
case,
pursuant
to
that
rule,
which
we
submit
is
a
procedural
rule
with
substantive
incidence.
or
whether
prejudgment
interest
is
appropriate
in
general.
on
the
latter
point,
let
me
say
this.
this
court
and
many
of
the
circuit
courts--
mr.
thomas
hollander
--i
think
a
case
can
be
made,
justice
scalia,
that
prejudgment
interest
ought
to
be
awarded
in
fela
cases
because
prejudgment
interest
is
awarded
in
so
many
federal
claims
across
the
country
in
federal
courts.
mr.
thomas
hollander
it
has
been
done
in
jones
act,
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
cases.
in
fact,
they
are
listed
in
our
brief.
and
i
can
give
you
more.
mr.
thomas
hollander
that's
correct.
on
that
point,
i
was
going
to
make
this
comment.
the
tenth
amendment
reserves
to
the
states
among
other
things,
as
interpreted
by
the
courts,
the
power
to
take
care
of
the
matters
essentially
for
the
disposition
of
cases
in
its
jurisdiction.
and
in
that
regard,
and
in
fact,
justice
frankfurter
said
in
the
indianapolis
v.
chase
national
bank
case
that
only
congress
can
restrict
the
power
of
states
to
provide
for
the
determination
of
controversies
within
it.
mr.
thomas
hollander
i
don't
know
how
many
states,
if
any,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
hollander
i
can
only
report
that
pennsylvania
has
this
rule.
mr.
thomas
hollander
i
did
and
i
saw
that
there
are
32
states
with
prejudgment
interest
statutes.
mr.
thomas
hollander
no,
no.
not
like
this
one.
this
rule--
mr.
thomas
hollander
--your
honor,--
mr.
thomas
hollander
--i
don't
know
that.
mr.
thomas
hollander
you
could
have.
every
state
could
say
that
this
would
be
a
way
in
which
we
can
reduce
congestion
and
delay
by
encouraging
settlements.
mr.
thomas
hollander
yes,
yes.
mr.
thomas
hollander
that's
correct,
i'm
sorry.
each
state
can
easily
promulgate
its
own
rules
to
determine
how
it
wants
to
move
along
the
congestion
in
its
courts.
mr.
thomas
hollander
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
i
would
agree
that
if
we
had
the
kinds
of
interest
rates
that
we
see
in
south
america
and
the
middle
east
in
three
digit
numbers,
that
it
would
not
be
unreasonable
to
have--
mr.
thomas
hollander
--well,
i
guess
i
heard
the
fifty
percent
and
thought
you
wanted
me
to
respond
to
that.
that,
if
it's
a
damage
percentage
that
is
applied
like
that,
the
answer
to
that
is
i
think
it's
consistent
with
rule
238,
yes.
and
i
think
that
the
problem
with
it
is
that
there's
a
substantive
due
process
question
raised
because
of
the
amounts
that
are
imposed.
mr.
thomas
hollander
well,
let
me
respond
first,
it's
not
my
position
that
federal
courts
should
adopt
rule
238.
i'm
not
seeking
that.
i'm
simply
saying
that
state
courts
should
be
permitted
to
use
a
rule
like
this
as
pennsylvania
has.
mr.
thomas
hollander
yes.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
because--
mr.
thomas
hollander
--yes,
i
do
take
that
position.
mr.
thomas
hollander
yes.
well,
no,
i'm
sorry.
if
there
was
a
flat
across
the
board
prejudgment
interest
rule,
a
common
law
rule
as
i
assume
you're
asking,
justice
kennedy,
no,
it
couldn't
be.
it
would
be
just
part
of
the
damages.
mr.
thomas
hollander
perhaps
i'm
having
difficulty
with
the
question.
i
believe
that
the
federal
courts
have
established
in
many
many
cases,
excluding
railroaders
which
i
believe
is
an
anachronism
in
view
of
congressional
intent
to
make
it
liberal
for
railroaders
to
be
able
to
recover,
has
excluded
them
and
i
think
that
in
all
these
other
cases
that
we've
referred
to
that
are
decided
in
the
brief
where
prejudgment
interest
is
awarded,
equity
is
done.
as
a
common
law
rule
then
it
would
apply
across
the
board
to
railroad
workers
which
are
the
group
now
that
are
singled
out.
mr.
thomas
hollander
if
the
offer
is
tendered
and
rejected--
mr.
thomas
hollander
--i
don't
think
they
could
take
the
position
that
if
it
was
a
federal
rule
allowing
prejudgment
interest
that
they
could
prevent
its
imposition
in
state
courts,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
hollander
well,
i
guess
if--
mr.
thomas
hollander
--i
guess
i'm
getting
caught
in
the
dilemma
that
i
was
going
to
refer
to
earlier
of
the
consideration
of
whether
there
is
a
state
court
right
to
have
a
procedural
rule
to
eliminate
congestion
which
passes
constitutional
muster
in
pennsylvania
as
well
as
federal
constitutional
muster,
both
by
this
court's
denying
certiorari
in
the
laudenberger
opinion,
and
the
third
circuit's
affirmance
of
that
matter
in
insurance
federation
of
pennsylvania
v.
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
so
i'm
saying
that
yes,
i
think
that's
consistent.
i
think
states
have
that
power.
it
does
nothing
to
violate
the
supremacy
clause
and
it's
not
an
area
that
is
preempted
because
congress
has
not
spoken
on
it.
and
therefore,
i
think
procedurally
they're
allowed
to
do
that,
even
if
it
has
some
substantive
implications.
mr.
thomas
hollander
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
hollander
no,
i
don't
believe
they
could.
mr.
thomas
hollander
they
have
treated
all
cases
over
which
they
have
jurisdiction
alike,
whether
it's
an
fela
case
or
not.
in
fact,
to
exclude
the
fela
case,
i
would
submit
might
violate
the
equal
protections
clause.
mr.
thomas
hollander
that's
correct,
if
they
wanted
to
do
that
in
pennsylvania,
they
could
pass
a
general
statute.
but
i'm
not
so
sure
that
that--
mr.
thomas
hollander
--my
argument
is
what
i
have
indicated--
mr.
thomas
hollander
--i
think
that
congress
did
not
preclude
it.
i
think
congress,
in
its
debates,
concerning
the
statute,
did
not
address
that
issue.
i
think
that
congress'
concern
about
access
to
courts
and
the
fact
that
lay
damages
reduces
the
validity
and
the
fairness
of
the
awards
is
consistent
with
the
award
of
prejudgment
interest.
so
if
i
may
for
a
moment
return
to
the
total
offset
point
that
we
were
discussing
earlier,
the
question
that
was
raised
earlier
during
the
railroad's
argument
concerning
whether
it
believed
the
jury
should
make
the
determination
of
the
method
of
selection
is
one
that
i
would
like
to
comment
on
briefly.
because,
interestingly
enough,
that
would
assume
that
the
pfeifer
decision
of
justice
stevens
and
this
court
in
1983
applies
in
this
case.
amicus
curiae,
in
its
brief,
indicates
that
pfeifer
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
although
the
railroad
takes
the
position
that
it
does,
or
at
least
it
has
taken
that
position
up
to
now.
the
question
that
comes
up
with
regard
to
pfeifer
is
this.
when
it
was
decided
in
1983,
it
gave
council
to
the
courts
and
lawyers
across
the
country
that
there
were
a
number
of
methods
that
were
appropriate
to
use
in
fela
cases,
or
in
that
case,
i'm
sorry,
in
5(b)
longshoremen
harbor
workers
act
cases.
in
that
regard,
justice
stevens
said
that
the
total
offset
method
that
pennsylvania
has
adopted
has
the
virtue
of
simplicity
and
may
even
be
economically
precise,
which
we
take
it
really
to
be
quite
an
endorsement
of
that
process.
because
in
that
opinion,
the
discussion
is
that
trying
to
approximately
impaired
earning
capacity
by
reduction
to
present
worth
is
a
kind
of
rough
and
ready
process.
and
if
this
one
has
some
economic
precision,
it
would
be
of
value.
what
the
court
said,
however,
was
that
a
deliberate
choice
must
be
made,
and
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
sitting
in
pittsburgh
and
said,
you
don't
have
to
reopen
the
record,
but
take
a
look
at
what's
gone
on
here,
and
then
consider
it.
but
in
dickerson
decided
by
this
court
in
1985,
the
court
restated
the
chesapeake
&
ohio
v.
kelly
holding
and
again
selected
no
single
method
as
did
the
kelly
court,
the
same
thing,
and
said
with
regard
to
what
the
lower
court
should
do
in
missouri
was
to
require
that
whatever
method
is
used,
that
it
take
into
account
inflation,
other
sources
of
wage
increases
and
the
rate
of
interest.
at
that
point,
the
court
said,
nothing
was
done
in
missouri,
the
missouri
court
ignored
the
entire
question
of
reduction
to
present
worth,
and
as
a
result,
there
was
no
reduction
to
present
worth
in
that
case.
and
it
was
sent
back
to
require
an
instruction.
in
the
case
before
this
court
now,
i
submit
to
you
that
kelly,
pfeifer
and
dickerson
have
been
complied
with.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
pennsylvania
courts
have
slavishly
followed
the
reduction
to
present
worth
requirements
of
federal
law
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
there
was
a
reduction.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
reduction
was
in
conformity
with
the
pennsylvania
decision
on
using
the
total
offset
method.
amicus,
in
its
brief,
admits
that
there
was
a
reduction.
and
what's
the
question
then?
whether
there
was
a
reduction
or
whether
there
should
be
an
instruction
for
a
reduction.
and
it's
obvious
that
the
reduction
is
the
bottom
line
and
the
important
part
of
the
element
of
damages.
mr.
thomas
hollander
that's
correct,
your
honor.
what
the
jury
was
instructed
was
that
the
court
was
going
to
take
care
of
it.
it
was
an
admonition
essentially
to
the
jury
not
to
do
anything
about
inflation
and
not
to
do
anything
about
reduction.
mr.
thomas
hollander
your
honor,
the
jury
was
told
that
their
award
would
essentially
have
a
reduced
worth
implication
because
of
what
the
court
told
them
it
was
doing
with
regard
to
the
use
of
the
total
offset
method.
the
net
effect
is
that
there
is
a
reduction
to
present
worth
but
the
jury
doesn't
have
to
calculate
it.
so
what
i
think
happened
in
this
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
based
on
the
figures
that
were
cited
to
you
by
counsel
is
the
jury
may
well
have
reduced
it
twice.
after
the
court
did
it
by
the
total
offset
method,
and
then
when
it
went
out
to
the
jury
room
to
deliberate
because
if
in
fact
the
jury
followed
the
instructions
of
the
court,
and
if
the
defendant's
contention
that
all
of
the
balance
of
the
verdict
of
the
$125,000
less
the
$50,000
lost
income
was
true,
there
would
have
been
no
award
for
pain
and
suffering
and
the
other
elements
of
emotional
distress
that
are
part
of
the
award,
and
the
jury
would
have
then
disobeyed
the
court's
orders.
i
submit
to
you
that
what
the
jury
did
was
give
less
than
even
the
total
offset
method
would
have
provided
for
in
this
case.
after
that...
and
by
the
way,
i
should
also
say
that
the
judge
did
make
a
selection
as
the
pfeifer
case
was
suggesting
the
non-jury
district
court
case
should
be
done
and
that
was
between
the
total
offset
method
which
the
plaintiffs
were
prepared
to
submit
and
the
position
that
the
defendant
took
in
a
request
for
instructions
that
essentially
would
have
caused
a
double
discount
because
the
court
had
not
entertained
evidence
concerning
inflation
in
accordance
with
kaczkowski.
it
instructed
the
jury
on
the
income
tax
considerations
required
by
this
court
in
the
leipelt
case
and
then
when
the
pfeifer
decision
came
down,
which
was
after
the
trial
of
this
case
and
the
decision
of
the
post-trial
motion
by
the
trial
judge,
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
asked
for
supplemental
briefs
concerning
the
pfeifer
case.
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
then
did
with
a
three-judge
panel
evaluate
the
record
and
appraise
it
to
determine
whether
the
total
offset
method
as
the
pfeifer
opinion
had
required
was
the
appropriate
method
to
use
for
a
railroad
worker
in
pittsburgh.
the
superior
court
could
have
remanded
the
case.
it
kept
it
and
said,
we
looked
at
it,
we
think
it's
appropriate
and
they
affirmed
it.
and
then
the
supreme
court,
which
had
previously
gone
through
the
agonizing
appraisal
of
the
various
methods
to
select
the
total
offset
method,
affirmed.
as
an
officer
of
the
court...
and
i'll
be
brief
in
this
regard...
i
would
like
to
make
one
comment
concerning
the
pfeifer
case.
and
that
is,
under
it,
if
it
is
to
apply
in
state
courts
and
if
it
is
to
apply
in
jury
cases,
which
we
submit
it
should
not
be
extended
to,
then
we
need
some
guidance.
and
we
need
guidance
because
of
the
very
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked,
do
you
expect
this
to
go
to
juries,
and
if
so,
how
do
you
go
about
doing
it.
this
court
said
in
the
pfeifer
case,
we
don't
want
seminars
on
economics
in
the
court
room.
we
don't
have
to
bring
in
all
of
the
expert
witnesses
to
talk
about
actuarial
information,
economic
information
and
what
methods
are
better
and
what
methods
are
worse.
and
then
to
introduce
evidence
of
how
to
implement
them
in
the
trial
of
a
personal
injury
case
of
a
railroader.
it
becomes
time
consuming
and
exorbitant
and
would
add
seriously
to
congestion.
if
it
is
to
be
applied
in
cases
like
this,
then
i
ask
that
it
be
done
prospectively
with
some
consideration
given
to
some
clarification
because
obviously
the
railroad
has
a
belief
that
we
submit
is
inconsistent
with
pfeifer.
in
short...
and
i
see
that
my
time
is
up...
there
are...
there
was
a
reduction
to
present
worth
in
this
case
in
compliance
with
federal
law.
mr.
thomas
hollander
the
verdict
was
in
1981.
mr.
thomas
hollander
the
superior
court
argument
briefs
were
done
before
pfeifer.
the
superior
court
argument
and
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
argument
were
post-pfeifer.
mr.
thomas
hollander
since
there
was
a
reduction
to
present
worth,
since
there
is
equity
and
justice
in
prejudgment
interest
in
any
event,
and
since
there
is
no
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause,
nothing
that
is
done
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
promulgating
rule
238
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
fela
or
with
congress'
intent
except
by
somebody's
inference
of
what
their
silence
was
many
years
ago
that
has
been
honored
reluctantly
by
circuit
courts
who
have
expounded
in
the
very
recent
time
in
the
third
circuit,
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
in
the
fifth
circuit,
that
prejudgment
interest
ought
to
be
allowed
in
these
cases,
and
since
there
is
no
reason
to
exclude
railroaders
from
the
rest
of
the
litigants
in
the
federal
system
who
are
entitled
to
have
prejudgment
interest,
i
ask
this
court
to
dismiss
the
appeal
or
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
in
its
entirety.
thank
you
very
much.
