mr.
paul
a.
manion
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
a
pennsylvania
court
of
common
pleas
sitting
in
a
federal
employers
liability
act
case
is
free
to
apply
state
court
rules
concerning
the
propriety
of
an
award
of
prejudgment
interest
and
the
reduction
of
an
award
for
impairment
of
future
earning
power
to
its
present
value,
or
must
apply
the
federal
law
applicable
to
those
issues.
the
facts
relevant
to
this
question
can
be
stated
very
briefly.
the
plaintiff
was
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
with
the
monessen
southwestern
railway
as
a
brakeman
conductor.
he
was
off
work
for
about
eighteen
months.
when
he
returned
to
work,
he
returned
as
a
radio
supply
clerk,
rather
than
as
a
brakeman
conductor.
he
filed
suit
under
the
fela
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
of
allegheny
county
in
pittsburgh.
at
that
trial,
he
claimed
damages
first
based
on
his
lost
wages
to
the
date
of
trial,
which
approximately
$50,000.
and
for
impairment
of
his
future
earning
power
based
on
his
claim
that
he
would
earn
approximately
$5,000
a
year
less
as
a
radio
supply
clerk
than
he
would
have
as
a
brakeman
conductor
for
the
remaining
fifteen
years
of
his
expected
work
life.
at
the
close
of
the
evidence,
counsel
for
the
railroad
submitted
a
point
for
charge
to
the
court,
requesting
the
court
to
charge
the
jury
on
reducing
an
award
for
impairment
of
future
earning
power
to
its
present
value.
in
that
request,
there
was
specifically
included
a
reference
to
present
worth
tables
of
which
the
court
had
already
taken
judicial
notice,
and
which
would
assist
the
jury
in
making
the
present
worth
reduction.
the
court
denied
the
request
stating
on
three
separate
occasions,
both
orally
and
in
writing
that
the
basis
for
the
court's
refusal
was
the
recently
announced
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
holding
that
a
present
worth
instruction
should
no
longer
be
given
in
the
courts
of
the
commonwealth
in
personal
injury
cases
in
which
claims
for
impairment
of
future
earning
power
were
asserted.
the
judge
made
that
very
specific
in
chambers
in
ruling
on
the
request
for
charge
before
she
instructed
the
jury,
then
again
in
the
charge
itself,
and
then
thirdly
in
her
opinion
on
post-trial
motions
for
judgment
n.o.v.
and
for
a
new
trial.
after
closing
arguments
of
counsel
and
the
court's
charge,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
for
$125,000,
an
amount
equal
to
the
claim
for
lost
wages
to
the
date
of
trial
of
$50,000
and
of
the
claim
for
impairment
of
future
earning
power
at
$5,000
a
year
for
fifteen
years,
the
plaintiff
being
fifty
years
of
age
at
the
date
of
trial
and
counsel
arguing
to
the
jury
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
that
although
it
could
award
damages
to
age
70,
an
award
based
on
retirement
at
age
65
would
not
be
unreasonable.
eleven
days
after
the
jury
verdict
and
pursuant
to
a
motion
of
counsel
for
plaintiff
and
over
the
objection
of
counsel
for
defendant,
the
judge
increased
the
jury's
verdict
by
adding
thereto
prejudgment
interest
at
the
rate
of
ten
percent
per
year
to
increase
the
$125,000
to
approximately
$152,000.
the
basis
for
that
addition
was
a
rule
which
had
been
promulgated
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
1978,
stating
that
in
bodily
injury
cases
tried
in
the
courts
of
the
commonwealth,
such
an
award
would
be
made
provided
that
certain
conditions
were
met.
that
is
that
the
defendant
had
not
made
an
offer
prior
to
trial,
which
was
at
least
75
percent
of
the
amount
which
the
jury
ultimately
returned.
that
was
done
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
it
is,
your
honor.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
both
in
this
case
and
in
laudenberger
said
that
its
purpose
was
to
encourage
settlement
to
rid
the
courts
of
congested
dockets.
there
are
serious
questions
as
to
whether
that
was
a
substantive
rule
within
the
rulemaking
part
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
it
dealt
with
that
issue
within
one
year
after
the
rule
was
promulgated,
found
it
to
be
procedural
but
acknowledged
that
it
had
very
substantial
substantive
implications.
and
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
found
it
to
be
substantive
in
the
jarvis
case
and
therefore
that
a
federal
court
must
apply
it
in
a
case
in
that
court
based
on
diversity
of
citizenship
because
of
its
substantial
substantive
effect.
but
the
articulated
reason
by
the
court
in
justifying
the
rule
was
that
it
was
within
its
rulemaking
powers.
of
course,
the
court
had
to
justify
it
on
that
basis
because
otherwise
it
would
have
been
found
to
have
not
been
validly
promulgated.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
true.
it's
not
an
absolute
rule,
there
is
one
condition.
and
i
should,
to
bring
the
court
up
to
date,
there
was
the
craig
decision
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
which
came
down
between
the
superior
court
and
supreme
court
decision
in
this
case
which
said
that
there
were
questions
of
due
process
raised
by
the
rule
in
that
the
defendant
may
not
have
been
at
fault
for
the
delay,
and
therefore
in
cases
after
craig
where
this
issue
came
up,
there
would
have
to
be
a
hearing
following
the
verdict
and
a
determination
made.
but
within
the
last
month,
the
court
announced
in
craig
that
its
procedural
rules
committee
was
instructed
to
come
up
with
a
new
rule.
the
new
rule
as
promulgated
in
the
pennsylvania
bulletin
on
february
6th,
which
will
take
effect
in
a
month
and
a
half,
in
essence
provides
that
as
long
as
no
offer
has
been
made
that
upon
the
jury
verdict,
there
will
be
an
award
of
prejudgment
interest
unless
the
defendant
files
a
motion
affirmatively
establishing
that
the
plaintiff
was
the
cause
of
at
least
some
of
the
delay.
except
for
those
conditions,
your
honor,
that
rule
was
applied
uniformly.
it
was
applied
uniformly
before
craig,
in
the
interval
after
craig
before
the
supreme
court
procedural
rules
committee
came
out
with
the
suggested
new
rule,
and
it's
being
applied
every
day
in
the
courts
of
the
commonwealth.
as
justice
hutchinson
pointed
out
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
there
can
be
no
question
that
this
rule
has
a
substantial
effect
on
damages.
in
this
case,
it
increased
the
award
by
at
least
20
percent.
that
gets
me
to
the
point
that
the
first
question
really
in
many
respects
this
case
perhaps
more
than
coincidentally
is
being
argued
on
the
50th
anniversary
by
only
a
few
days
of
this
court's
decision
in
erie
railroad
v.
tompkins.
as
your
honors
will
recall,
that
case
involved
the
question
whether
a
federal
court,
hearing
a
case
based
on
its
diversity
jurisdiction
which
arose
solely
under
state
law
was
free
to
apply
its
own
general
version
of
what
the
common
law
should
be,
or
was
obliged
to
apply
state
law
as
construed
by
the
courts
of
the
state.
and
of
course,
justice
brandeis'
classic
opinion
and
landmark
in
the
field
of
federal-state
relations
said
that
the
federal
court
would
have
to
defer
to
state
law,
not
because
of
any
notion
of
superiority
or
inferiority
between
the
two
systems
of
courts,
but
because
of
the
fundamental
precept.
first
that
the
law
to
be
applied
to
a
claim
should
be
the
law
out
of
which
the
claim
arose.
secondly,
the
fostering
of
any
other
rule
would
lead
to
chaos
as
it
has
in
pennsylvania
because
the
third
circuit
justice
declared
last
august
that
you
cannot
apply
prejudgment
interest
in
an
fela
case.
so
that
litigants
in
pittsburgh
under
a
statute
the
principal
purpose...
or
at
least
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
which
was
to
provide
for
a
national
uniformity
for
railroad
workers
across
the
country,
not
only
are
we
getting
different
results
between
one
state
and
another,
but
in
pittsburgh,
you
will
get
a
substantially
different
result
depending
upon
whether
you
file
your
suit
at
7th
and
grant
in
the
federal
court
where
you
won't
get
prejudgment
interest,
or
up
the
street
at
4th
and
grant,
where
you'll
get
an
award
of
at
least
20
percent
in
this
case,
substantially
enlarging
the
damages.
it's
clear
that
federal
law
has
to
be
applied
here,
not
because
the
federal
courts
are
superior
to
the
state
courts,
but
this
is
a
federal
statute.
it
cries
out
for
national
uniformity
and
enforcement.
and
it
can't
be
justified
on
the
ground
of
a
substantive
procedural
distinction.
this
court
has
long
held
in
fela
cases
starting
at
least
in
1916
in
the
chesapeake
&
ohio
railroad
v.
kelly
case
the
question
of
the
proper
measure
of
damages
is
inseparably
connected
with
the
right
of
action.
and
in
cases
arising
under
the
fela,
it
must
be
settled
according
to
general
principles
of
law
as
administered
in
the
federal
courts.
eight
years
ago
in
the
liepelt
case,
justice
stevens
said,
it
has
long
been
settled
that
questions
concerning
the
measure
of
damages
in
an
fela
action
are
federal
in
character.
and
justice
blackmun
in
dissent
stating
that
income
tax
instructions
the
question
whether
they
should
be
given
is
an
incidental
matter.
perhaps
we
should
defer
to
state
procedure.
but
he
said,
of
course,
i
assume
that
if
this
procedural
rule
has
substantive
impact...
as
it
does
in
our
case...
regardless
of
how
the
state
labels
its
rule,
it's
got
to
give
way
to
federal
law.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
it
was
not,
your
honor.
it
was
done
by
the
trial
judge
11
days
after
the
verdict.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
rule
238
which
is
applicable
since
1978
in
common
law
bodily
injury
cases
or
those
which
involve
property
damage
provides
that
the
award
shall
be
at
the
rate
of
ten
percent
per
year
providing
the
conditions
are
met
that
there's
been
no
offer
by
the
defendant
and
that
the
award
exceeds
any
offer
by
125
percent.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
and
of
course,
that's
another
reason
why
this
rule
of
course
was
adopted
in
that
inflationary
period
of
the
late
70s.
it's
being
applied
at
a
rate
of
ten
percent
per
annum.
we
are
getting
in
some
states,
of
course,
there's
no
prejudgment
interest
in
most
fela
cases
in
any
state
court.
this
statute
has
been
construed
over
80
years
on
the
question
of
the
allowance
of
the
award
of
prejudgment
interest
consistently.
state
and
federal
courts
have
held
uniformly
that
you
cannot
award
prejudgment
interest
under
the
fela.
it
was
held
not
only...
and
we've
cited
a
multitude
contrary
to
the
suggestion
of
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
that
these
are
primarily
federal
cases...
not
only
are
they
state
court
cases
but
they
are
state
court
cases
in
states
which
have
prejudgment
interest
rules,
many
of
them,
and
the
state
courts
have
said,
we
have
to
apply
federal
law
because
this
is
the
fela.
this
isn't
the
ordinary
automobile
accident
case.
this
is
a
federal
statute.
for
80
years
the
court
has
held
that
you
cannot
award
prejudgment
interest--
mr.
paul
a.
manion
--i
am
not,
your
honor.
i
am
relying
primarily
on
decisions
of
the
federal
appellate
courts
and
decisions
of
the
supreme
courts
of
the
highest
states
in
the
country.
i
think
that
the
course
of
history
is
such
that
there
has
been
so
much
judicial
precedent
that
this
long
history
of
judicial
precedent
construing
this
statute
when
congress
has
had
the
opportunity
to,
and
has
amended
it
repeatedly
by--
mr.
paul
a.
manion
--yes,
your
honor.
most
of
them
are
based
either
on
state
statutes
involving
prejudgment
interest,
or
court
rules.
many
of
the
court
rules...
they
vary
all
over
the
lot...
that's
another
reason
why
a
state
court
rule
should
not
be
applied
in
an
fela
case.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
i
believe
a
substantial
number
of
them
do,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
it
was
in
the
first.
judge
becker's
opinion
is
about
20
pages
and
he
starts
off
his
opinion,
you
can't
possibly
justify
the
use
of
rule
238
to
award
prejudgment
interest
in
an
fela
case.
a
closer
question
which
still
must
be
resolved
against
the
plaintiff
is
not
whether
you
can
use
a
state
court
rule
to
justify
it.
that's
clear.
that's
the
clear
air
in
this
opinion.
regardless
of
what's
done
here,
the
judge
did
it
on
the
basis
of
a
state
rule.
justice
steven's
decision
for
the
court
in
the
pfeifer
case
makes
it
clear
you
can't
do
it
on
that
basis.
there's
a
nicer
question.
that
is,
would
such
an
award
be
consistent
with
federal
law.
on
that
question,
that
has
to
be
resolved
against
the
plaintiff,
because
when
the
fela
was
adopted
in
1908,
congress
took
the
state
of
the
common
law
as
it
then
existed
with
respect
to
tort
claims
for
personal
injuries
and
adopted
in
section
1
a
rule
that
provided
that
fela
plaintiffs
would
be
awarded
damages
for
injuries
sustained
as
a
result
of
the
negligence
of
the
employer,
how
slight.
prejudgment
interest
existed
at
common
law
in
1908,
but
it
was
permitted
only
in
liquidated
damages
claims
for
breach
of
contract
or
other
situations
where
the
damages
were
liquidated.
it
was
never
permitted
in
personal
injury
cases
where
the
damages
were
unliquidated.
congress
saw
fit
to
abolish
the
common
law
rule
under
which
contributory
negligence
was
an
absolute
bar.
it
said
that
it
will
not
be
an
absolute
bar;
comparative
negligence
will
be
the
rule.
in
section
3,
the
very
same
section
in
which
it
did
that,
it
said,
moreover,
contributory
negligence
will
not
be
any
defense
where
the
injury
arises
from
a
violation
of
the
safety
appliance
act.
in
1939,
all
the
while
we
have
hundreds
of
cases
going
up
through
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts,
none
of
which
allows
prejudgment
interest.
in
'39,
congress,
looking
at
the
fela,
a
statute
with
which
congress
has
been
concerned,
with
which
this
court
has
been
concerned,
consistent
line
of
decisions.
in
'39,
congress
said,
we're
going
to
abolish
assumption
of
the
risk
as
a
defense.
they
did
that.
eighty
years
of
history
from
1908
to
1988.
not
one
court
has
ever
said
that
prejudgment
interest
is
authorized
until
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
the
only
court
that
did
so
was
a
district
court
in
colorado
which
was
reversed
in
the
tenth
circuit
a
few
years
ago
in
the
garcia
case.
and
even
in
garcia,
they
didn't
say
you
can
justify
this
under
a
state
statute.
they
said
it
may
be
consistent
with
federal
law.
when
you
take
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
fela,
congress'
deliberate
decisions
which
aspects
of
common
law
it
would
do
away
with
and
which
it
would
incorporate
in
this
admittedly
liberal
statute,
which
this
court
has
consistently
construed
as
broadening
liability
but
has
never
held
that
you
can
get
prejudgment
interest.
the
state
of
the
law
at
that
time,
the
80
years
of
precedent,
congress
all
the
while
acting
on
this
statute,
amending
it
when
it
felt
appropriate,
never
adopting
a
rule.
as
the
fifth
circuit
has
said,
and
other
courts
have
said,
the
silence
of
congress
in
1908
speaks
loudly
and
clearly
that
congress
never
intended
to
allow
prejudgment
interest.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
your
honor...
yes.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
if
there
were
a
sanction
imposed,
for
example.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
because
counsel
had
delayed
the
prosecution
of
the
case--
mr.
paul
a.
manion
--i
don't
think
that
would
be
permitted,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
not
as
a
state
rule.
not
unless
it
was
a
federal
matter,
because
you're
doing
something
which
has
a
substantial
effect
on
the
amount
of
damages,
on
the
award
itself.
you
could
justify
an
award
as
a
penalty
because
counsel
did
something
wrong,
but
merely
because
they
didn't
make
an
offer,
when
an
offer
may
not
have
been
appropriate.
they
couldn't
do
that.
that
would
substantially
enlarge
the
remedy
and
the
remedy
is
extricably
intertwined
with
the
cause
of
action.
i'd
just
cover
the--
mr.
paul
a.
manion
--whether
the
true
motivation
of
the
court
is
to
clear
up
the
congested
docket,
that
also
is
a
consideration,
your
honor.
i
think
regardless
of
the
rationale
advanced,
the
core
inquiry
is
does
this
rule,
this
law
have
a
substantial
effect
on
the
rights
of
the
litigants.
and
using
the
outcome
determinative
test
that
was
developed
after
erie
railroad,
are
you
going
to
get
a
substantially
different
result
when
you
go
down
grant
street
to
state
court,
compared
with
when
you
go
up
grant
street
to
federal
court?
and
here,
it's
clear.
this
is
a
relatively
nominal
award,
considering
that
there
was
only
two
years
of
prejudgment
interest.
but
if
the
case
happens
to
be
on
a
docket
and
the
cases
aren't
tried
for
three
or
four
years,
you're
going
to
have
awards
which
can
double
in
some
instances,
the
amount
that's
awarded
by
the
jury.
to
say
that
doesn't
have
substantive
effect
is
to
ignore
reality.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
i
was
about
to
address
that,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
such
an
effort.
as
the
third
circuit
has
held,
that
obligation
is
not
on
the
defendant;
it's
on
the
plaintiff
because
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proof.
but
in
1916,
this
court
held
in
chesapeake
&
ohio
r.r.
v.
kelly
that
any
award
for
impairment
of
future
earning
power
had
to
be
reduced
to
its
present
value.
and
the
case
really
dealt
with
the
fact
that
whether
present
worth
tables
not
only
were
good
evidence,
but
were
they
conclusive.
and
the
court
held
they
are
good
evidence
probative
of
what
the
jury
should
do
or
what
the
fact
finder
should
do
in
reducing
an
award
to
its
present
value.
but
it's
clear
that
they
are
good
evidence.
in
our
case,
we
had
an
instruction
that
is
set
out
in
our
brief
and
also
in
the
appendix.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
well,
your
honor,--
mr.
paul
a.
manion
--i
don't
think
it's
open
to
the
court,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
a
matter
for
the
fact
finder.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
it
was
in
pfeifer,
your
honor,
because
the
court
was
sitting
non-jury.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
it
is,
your
honor,
because
like
a
lot
of
questions
of
that
kind,
it
depends
on
the
evidence
which
goes
into
the
record.
the
plaintiff
may
call
an
economist
that
says,
this
is
the
best
record.
the
defendant
may
call
an
economist--
mr.
paul
a.
manion
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
as
long
as
there
are
disputed
issues
concerning
facts
that
are
inherent
in
the
method
whether
we
use
a
six
percent
discount
rate--
mr.
paul
a.
manion
--i
think
justice
hutchinson
makes
the
point
in
his
dissent
in
this
case
and
your
honor
understanding
now
we're
talking
not
just
about
the
method
in
terms
of
a
legal
method,
but
where
it
involves
issues
of
fact
concerning
the
discount
rate.
whether
it
should
be
total
offset,
whether
it
should
be
real
interest
rate
the
difference
between
inflation
and
the
nominal
interest
rate.
whether
it
should
be
what
someone
earns
in
their
savings
account.
this
court
held
that
in
chesapeake
&
ohio.
the
jury
knows.
they
put
money
in
savings
accounts.
we're
not
going
to
use
the
rate
of
interest
that
ivan
boesky
or
someone
might
get.
we're
going
to
use
what
the
ordinary
person,
and
jurors
being
ordinary
people
know
what
interest
is.
it's
up
to
them
to
make
that
selection.
it
must
be,
your
honor,
with
appropriate
instructions
from
the
court.
you've
heard
varying
methods
of
discounting
to
present
value.
but
justice
stevens
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
in
pfeifer
said,
it
is
for
the
fact
finder
to
make
that
determination.
he
surveyed
at
least
seven
different
methods
and
said,
we're
going
to
return
this
and
it's
for
the
fact
finder.
in
this
case,
the
court
violated
this
court's
mandate
in
dickerson
saying
that
you
can't
refuse
the
charge
on
the
basis
of
the
state
rule.
and
dickerson
says,
you've
got
to
leave
it
to
the
fact
finder.
judge
finkelhor
took
it
away
from
the
fact
finder.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
manion
your
honor,
to
answer
justice
stevens'
last
question,
part
of
the
delay
in
the
appellate
courts
was
that
the
superior
court,
on
suggestion
of
counsel,
delayed
its
decision
or
consideration
pending
pfeifer
which
had
been
granted
cert.
so
that
about
two
years
of
it
was
because
of
pfeifer
because
of
the
thought
that
it
might
have
some
impact.
justice
o'connor,
to
address
again
your
present
value
question,
it's
our
position
that
dickerson
controls
and
that
as
your
honor
suggested,
the
court
must
charge
on
present
value.
what
we
say
is
that
this
court,
even
assuming
it
were
a
court
decision,
a
deliberate
choice
of
the
court
as
justice
stevens'
language
suggests
concerning
that
there
must
be
a
deliberate
choice,
no
such
deliberate
choice
was
made
in
this
case
by
the
court,
by
the
jury
or
anyone
else.
you
can't
read
this
record.
when
judge
finkelhor
said
in
chambers,
we
have
reached
the
decision
not
to
give
the
present
worth
charge,
and
the
basis
for
it
is,
chief
justice
nix's
decision
in
bolubasz,
it's
clear
that
it
was,
as
your
honor
justice
stevens
said
in
pfeifer,
blind
adherence
to
state
law.
it
wasn't
a
deliberate
choice.
she
said
it
three
times,
once
in
writing
in
her
post-judgment
opinion,
and
twice,
once
in
chambers
and
then
when
she
charged
the
jury,
you
don't
have
to
bother
to
make
this
reduction
any
more
because
there's
a
recent
decision,
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
to
say
that
that
was
a
deliberate
choice,
as
justice
hutchinson
pointed
out,
is
to
defy
the
record.
your
honor,
it
is
the
choice
of
the
fact
finder,
because
like
any
issue,
you're
dealing
with
economics.
and
we
don't
have
to
call
economists
in.
you
do
it
the
way
the
court
suggested
70
years
ago.
you
have
present
value
tables
in
which
the
jury
makes
the
determination
of
what
rate
is
appropriate
and
the
tables
indicate
what
you
award
based
on
the
years
out
into
the
future.
just
as
you
use
life
expectancy
tables.
what
we're
suggesting
would
actually
do
away
with
economists
in
terms
of
their
need
in
these
kinds
of
cases
because--
mr.
paul
a.
manion
--oh,
no,
your
honor.
we
would
permit--
mr.
paul
a.
manion
--well,
your
honor,
it's
clear
that
when
one
is
projecting
into
the
future,
particularly
in
these
cases,
you
take
into
account
what
the
wage
rates
were
for
the
last
ten
years,
and
what
they
might
be
into
the
future.
no
decent
plaintiff's
lawyer
doesn't
say,
if
he
was
making
this
much
and
it
increased
this
much
each
year,
probably
most
of
which
was
attributable
to
inflation
or
cost
of
living,
that
you
can
do
that
into
the
future.
and
that
you
can
show
productivity
or
merit
increases.
that's
permissible.
but
you
can't
do
it
when
you're
discounting
to
present
value.
