chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
86-1743,
monessen
southwestern
railway
company
versus
gerald
l.
morgan.
mr.
manion,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
the
announced
purpose
of
rule
238
to
encourage
settlement
in
this
kind
of
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
pennsylvania
doesn't
say
prejudgment
interest
is
awarded
as
a
matter
of
right
to
a
prevailing
plaintiff;
it's
only
where
there
was
a
failure
to
submit
an
offer
of
a
particular
kind
by
the
defendant?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
for
80
years,
the
court
has
held
that.
are
you
relying
on
any
particular
decision
of
this
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
third
circuit
case
certainly
would
be
because
it
was
dealing
with
the
pennsylvania
rule,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
manion.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
hollander.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
hollander,
this
court
has
handed
down
many
many
decisions
saying
on
fairly
minor
points
that
federal
law
rather
than
state
law
governs
how
you
construe
a
complaint.
what
standard
is
used
for
judging
a
release.
and
it
seems
to
me
none
of
those
are
any
more
really
distinguishable
from
this.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
that
really
the
question
whether
it's
a
just
concept
here?
in
other
words,
if
we
thought
it
was
a
desirable
thing,
does
that
mean
that
even
though
it
would
make
quite
a
different
result
in
pennsylvania
as
opposed
to
the
federal
courts
instead,
we
should
nonetheless
say
it's
all
right
because
we
think
it's
just?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
think
that's
the
standard
that
our
cases
have
laid
down.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i'm
not
asking--
--couldn't
you
say
the
same
thing
for
jones
act
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
quite
a
different
argument
than
saying
rule
238
can
be
applied
by
the
pennsylvania
state
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hollander.
mr.
manion,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
manion.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases,
no.
86-1743,
monessen
southwestern
railway
company
against
morgan,
no.
87-519,
maynard
versus
cartwright
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
