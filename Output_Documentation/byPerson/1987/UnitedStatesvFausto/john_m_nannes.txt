mr.
john
m.
nannes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
rests
upon
three
propositions,
all
of
which
are
important
and
two
of
which
the
government
does
not
contest.
first,
mr.
fausto
was
discharged
in
violation
of
agency
regulations.
the
department
of
interior
regulations
provided
that
a
career-type,
nonpreference
excepted
service
employee
who
was
discharged
had
a
right
to
receive
notice
in
a
discharge
decision
of
his
right
to
pursue
the
agency
grievance
mechanism.
and
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
interior
further
provide
for
the
small
universe
of
employees
that
they
had
a
right
to
a
full
evidentiary
hearing
if
they
were
being
discharged
for
cause.
it
is
undisputed
that
mr.
fausto
was
not
provided
these
rights
at
the
time
that
he
was
discharged,
and
i
do
not
understand
the
government
to
contest
that
the
agency
fulfilled
its
obligation
under
the
regulations.
thus,
this
case
comes
to
the
court
with
the
concession
by
the
government
that
the
agency
violated
its
regulations.
second,
mr.
fausto
would
have
been
entitled
to
judicial
review
if
he
had
been
discharged
prior
to
passage
of
the
civil
service
reform
act
of
1978.
the
government
endeavors
in
its
reply
brief,
and
it
has
made
the
point
once
more
here
today
that
that
is
somehow
an
implied
right
or
a
judicially
implied
right.
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
old
court
of
claims
support
the
proposition
that
that
was
a
statutory
right
of
judicial
review.
the
combination
of
the
tucker
act,
which
provides
for
a
cause
of
action
when
there
has
been
a
violation
of
an
agency
regulation,
in
conjunction
with
the
back
pay
act,
which
is
a
money
mandating
remedy,
and
the
violation
by
the
agency
in
this
instance
of
his
procedural
regulations,
provided
mr.
fausto
with
a
statutory
cause
of
action.
the
greenway
decision,
which
happens
to
be
one
of
the
cases
that
the
court
below
cited,
is
by
no
means
the
only
case
holdings
in
that
manner.
indeed,
if
the
court
goes
back
and
looks
in
the
aftermath
of
its
decision
almost
30
years
ago
in
vitarelli
v.
seaton,
it
will
find
that
the
employee
who
was
there
wrongfully
discharged
was
then
reinstated
by
his
agency.
he
contended
that
the
back
pay
that
the
agency
had
awarded
him
was
insufficient,
and
he
filed
a
cause
of
action
in
the
old
court
of
claims,
and
that
cause
of
action
was
sustained.
it
is
very
much
a
statutory
cause
of
action,
and
it
preceded
the
enactment
of
the
civil
service
reform
act.
third,
the
court
of
appeals
below
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
congress
intended
when
it
enacted
the
civil
service
reform
act
of
1978,
to
repeal
rights
of
judicial
review
that
previously
would
have
been
available
to
employees
such
as
mr.
fausto.
this
is
certainly
a
proposition
that
the
government
does
contest,
and
thus,
the
issue
presented
for
this
court
is
whether
it
is
fairly
discernable
that
when
congress
enacted
the
civil
service
reform
act,
that
it
intended
to
extinguish
or
repeal
statutory
right
that
otherwise
would
have
continued
to
be
available
to
nonpreference
excepted
service
employees
such
as
mr.
fausto.
notably,
your
honors,
the
government
does
not
rely
upon
any
specific
preclusion
language
in
the
civil
service
reform
act
itself.
there
is
indeed
no
provision
in
that
act,
chapter
75
or
elsewhere,
that
specifies
that
prior
remedies
that
had
been
available
to
other
types
of
employees
were
intended
to
be
extinguished
by
the
congress.
thus,
under
the
holding
of
this
court
almost
30
years
ago
in
vitarelli
v.
seaton,
mr.
fausto
has
a
right
of
judicial
review
to
obtain
review
of
his
discharge
in
violation
of
agency
regulations.
the
government
seeks
to
distinguish
vitarelli
on
the
proposition
that
congress
had
not
specifically
indicated
with
respect
to
the
statute
there
involved
an
intention
to
preclude
judicial
review.
but
i
would
note
for
the
court
that
the
statute
pursuant
to
which
mr.
vitarelli
was
discharged
provided
the
secretary
of
interior
with
a
right
to
discharge
him
that
would
be
"final
and
conclusive"
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
of
an
analogous
preclusionary
sort
in
the
civil
service
reform
act.
and
yet,
in
vitarelli
a
right
of
judicial
review
was
upheld.
instead,
the
government
relies
upon
broad
arguments
drawn
from
a
so-called
statutory
scheme.
it
is
certainly
true
that
in
other
provisions
of
the
civil
service
reform
act,
such
as
chapter
23,
which
deals
with
prohibitive
personnel
practices,
and
chapter
43,
that
deals
with
performance
appraisal
standards,
that
various
rights
are
accorded
to
nonpreference
excepted
service
employees.
but
the
inclusion
of
references
to
those
employees
in
chapter
23
and
chapter
43
simply
provide
no
guidance
to
the
court
as
to
what
the
congressional
intention
was
underlying
enactment
of
chapter
75.
it
is
notable
that
the
government
ignores
the
legislative
history
underlying
that
chapter,
but
it
nevertheless
tries
to
draw
broad
conclusions
based
on
the
statutory
scheme.
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
quite
conclusively
that
when
congress
enacted
chapter
75
it
had
a
far
more
limited
objective
in
mind.
part
of
the
purpose
underlying
chapter
75
was
to
transfer
the
adjudicatory
jurisdiction
over
employee
appeals
that
had
formerly
resided
in
the
old
civil
service
commission,
and
instead,
to
transfer
that
to
the
new
agency,
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
and
that
congress
also
intended
thereby
to
consolidate
judicial
review
of
such
decision
in
what
has
now
become
the
federal
circuit,
rather
than
to
permit
actions
to
be
initiated
in
district
courts
throughout
the
country
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
there
is
simply
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
underlying
chapter
75
that
congress
was
intending
thereby
to
change
the
rules
that
had
previously
been
available
to
nonpreference
excepted
service
employees.
what
congress
did--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
john
m.
nannes
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
no,
your
honor.
we
would
take
the
position
that
with
respect
to
employees
who
are
defined
as
covered
by
chapter
75,
that
the
chapter
75
rights
do
provide
an
exclusive
enumeration
of
the
rights
to
which
they
are
entitled.
so
that,
for
example,
in
the
numerous
courts
of
appeal
cases
where
employees
who
are
covered
by
chapter
75
have
endeavored
to
assert
rights
either
as
an
implied
cause
of
action
or
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
those
rights
have...
those
efforts
have
been
rebuffed
and
rejected.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
your
honor,
i
think
there
certainly
would
be
if
that
were
the
fact
applicable
to
mr.
fausto,
and
the
government
endeavors
to
characterize
mr.
fausto's
rights
as
i
think
more
powerful
engines
of
enforcement,
for
example,
than
are
available
to
competitive
service
employees.
in
point
of
fact,
a
nonpreference
excepted
service
employee
such
as
mr.
fausto
was
required
to
exhaust
his
administrative
grievance
system.
in
this
case,
that
was
a
three-tier
system
of
administrative
review,
and
it
took
him
from
january
1981
until
february
1985
to
get
a
full
determination
of--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
a
specific
exhaustion
requirement.
but
i
think
either
as
a
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction,
or
some
analogue,
had
he
gone
right
from
his
discharge
decision
into
the
claims
court,
the
claims
court
either
would
have
dismissed
or
would
have
stayed
and
required
him
to
exhaust.
but
the
notable
feature
here,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
is
that
an
employee
who
is
defined
within
the
coverage
of
chapter
75
is
not
required,
and
indeed
is
prohibited
from
pursuing
the
agency
grievance
system.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
two
responses
to
that.
first--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--your
honor,
in
the
first
instance,
the
office
of
personnel
management
has
promulgated
regulations
that
do
require
all
agencies
to
promulgate
and
adopt
an
agency
grievance
mechanism.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
if
an
employee
such
as
mr.
fausto
were
to
endeavor
to
do
so,
he
would
be
met
i
think
with
a
more
formidable
problem,
because
he
would
have
no
agency
regulation
that
had
been
violated
to
predicate
his
claim
under
the
tucker
act.
it's
only
the
agency's
disregard
of
its
grievance
right
and
its
right
to
a
hearing
that
is
conferred
upon
mr.
fausto
that
provide
the
regulation
basis
for
his
tucker
act
claim.
so
it
may
be
true
that
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
file
his
complaint,
but
it's
unlikely
to
be
one
that
would
be
of
substantive
import.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
well,
to
the
extent,
your
honor--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--well,
i
think
there
might
be
some
difficulty
if
an
employee
were
endeavoring
to
try
to
get
a
court
to
review
the
merits
of
the
claim.
so
we
are
simply
confining
the
argument
to
a
situation
where
an
employee
was
denied
procedural
rights
to
which
he
was
entitled
under
the
grievance
system.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
yes,
your
honor.
if
there
is
no
regulation
that
constrains
the
ability
of
the
agency
to
discharge,
then
the...
or
any
statute
that
does
so,
then
the
employee
would
be
subject
to
discharge.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
formal
actions.
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
and
employee
in
mr.
fausto's--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and
i
would
concede
that.
the
difficulty
that
the
government
has,
though,
with
extrapolating
from
that
proposition
to
the
conclusion
it
tries
to
reach
is
that
it
wants
to
ignore
the
legislative
history
underlying
the
specific
provisions.
chapter
23
and
43
and
75
may
have
been
enacted
as
part
of
a
single
statute,
but
the
origin
and
evolution
of
those
provisions
are
really
quite
distinct
and
quite
different.
there
was
no
predecessor
to
chapter
43,
for
example,
and
thus,
everything
that
congress
did
there
was
writing
on
a
new
slate.
whereas
if
you
look
at
the
practice
prior
to--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
absolutely
correct.
the
argument
that
we
would
make
is
that--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--oh,
i'm
sure
it
was
aware
of
it,
your
honor.
i
guess
the
objective
i...
or
the
point
i
would
simply
urge
upon
the
court
is
that
prior
to
enactment
of
the
1978
act,
competitive
service
employees
had
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
old
civil
service
commission.
that
was
by
executive
order.
and
veterans
had
the
right
to
appeal
established
by
statute
to
the
old
civil
service
commission.
and
what
we
maintain
is
simply
that
when
congress
endeavored
to
abolish
the
old
civil
service
commission
and
to
substitute
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
it
simply
brought
forward
and
transferred
over
to
that
appellate
process
the
same
employees
who
had
formerly
enjoyed
those
rights
prior
to
the
act.
since,
of
course,
mr.
fausto
prior
to
1978
would
have
had
a
right
to
pursue
his
claim
under
the
tucker
act,
we
argue
that
the
mere
transfer
of
those
responsibilities
by
congress
in
1978
cannot
be
read
so
broadly
as
to
extinguish
rights
that
he
otherwise
would
have
enjoyed.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
it
might
be...
it
might
have
been
exceptionally
more
difficult
for
mr.
fausto
to
so
proceed
because
he
was
relying
upon
the
rights
established
for
him
by
regulation.
and
if
we
define
out
those
regulatory
violations,
then
he
might
have
no
predicate
basis
upon
which
to
file
in
the
claims
court.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
in
this
instance
it
was
the
failure
to
notify
him
of
his
right
to
grieve,
and
the
failure
to
accord
him
a
formal
hearing--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--if
he
had
been
fired
for
inefficiency
such
that
it
would
be
regarded
as
a
chapter
43
dismissal,
adverse
action
based
on
nonperformance,
or
misperformance,
he
would
then
be
governed
by
chapter
43
procedures
and
he
would
not
have
had
a
right
to
judicial
review,
although
he
would
have
had
certain
administrative
rights
to
notice.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
he
would
have
had
to
have
notice,
i
think
an
opportunity
to
answer
and
a
written
decision.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
it's
certainly
consistent,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
result
reached,
because
it--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--let's
see,
i
guess
if
we
were--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--if
we
were
speaking
certainly
of
employees
who
were
in
the
competitive
service,
or
preference
eligible
employees,
employees
who
are
covered
within
the
scope
of
chapter
75--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
i
think
that
result
would
certainly
not
follow
with
respect
to
competitive
service
and
preference
eligible
employees,
because
under
the
reasoning
of
the
carducci
decision
and
the
legislative
history
underlying
chapter
75,
it
was
intended
to
be
exclusive
for
employees
within
the
reach.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
suppose--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--excuse
me.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
conclusion
automatically
follows.
i
have
some
difficulty
offering
up
a
distinction.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
mr.
fausto
did
not
seek
judicial
review
in
this
instance,
nor
if
we
hypothesize
a
13-day
suspension,
is
he
likely
to
be
able
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
the
merits
of
the
agency
determination.
all
that
would
be
left,
i
think,
is
the
possibility
that
he
might
be
able
to
complain
of
an
agency
disregard
of
his
procedural
violations,
and
then
it
starts
to
get
very
close
to
what
mr.
wright
referred
to
his
opening
argument
as
a
proper
case
for
possible
mandamus.
but
by
and
large,
i
do
not
think
that
affirmance
of
the
decision
below
would
have
the
practical
consequence
of
opening
up
the
claims
court
or
any
other
court
to
efforts
to
obtain
judicial
review
with
respect
to--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--i
don't
think
they
fit
100
percent,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
the
area
that's
left
as
a
gap
is
a
relatively
small
one,
and
one
that
presumably
could
be
corrected
by
either
administrative
regulation,
or
certainly
a
congressional
act.
in
the
absence
of
broad
language
either
of
a
specific
preclusive
sort
or
of
a
statutory
scheme
that
supports
its
broad
characterization
of
the
effort
by
congress
to
preclude
judicial
review,
the
government
does
make
certain
illusions
to
the
possibility
of
anomalous
or
illogical
results
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
an
excepted
service
employee
such
as
mr.
fausto
might
be
able
to
get
into
court
more
quickly
than
might
a
competitive
service
or
a
preference
eligible
employee.
i
think
the
fact
that
the
competitive
service
employee
enjoys
the
rights
that
are
conferred
by
chapter
75
is
indeed
a
very
substantial
advantage
and
was
intended
specifically
by
congress
to
confer
additional
rights
on
those
employees.
an
employee
who
is
entitled
to
chapter
75
rights
has
an
opportunity
to
appeal
directly
from
the
initial
agency
decision
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
is
accorded
a
statutory
right
to
an
expeditious
decision
in
a
proceeding
in
which
the
agency
bears
the
burden
of
proof,
and
thereafter
can
go
directly
to
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
your
honor,
i
think
a
distinction
could
be
drawn
between
the
two.
the
record
in
this
case--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--i
draw
the
distinction
at
least
insofar
as
to
say
that
the
manner
in
which
this
case
comes
to
this
court
is
only
in
the
former
situation.
because
when
mr.
fausto
filed
suit
in
the
claims
court,
there
had
already
been
an
administrative
determination
that
his
discharge
had
been
unwarranted
and
unjustified.
and
the
question
left
for
judicial
review
is
whether
he
had
been
made
whole
under
the
terms
of
the
back
pay
act.
it
would
have
been
a
far
different
matter,
and
i
think
no
great
concession
to
say
that
it
would
have
been
far
more
difficult
for
him
to
maintain
that
he
had
an
opportunity
for
the
court
to
review
the
merits
of
the
determination
of
the--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--well,
with
respect
to
an
excepted
service
employee,
your
honor,
i
think
he
has
to
look,
since
he
does
not
have
a
right
by
statute
to
discharge
by
cause,
to
whether
the
regulation
provides
him
with
such
a
right.
in
the
absence
of
a
regulation
that
provided
him
with
a
right
to
be
discharged
only
for
cause,
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
how
there
would
be
a
record
or
an
evidentiary
basis
for
him
to
seek
a
merit's
based
determination.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
the
effort
that
i
think
congress
had
in
mind
with
respect
to
dividing--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--no,
your
honor.
the
allegation
in
the
complaint...
i'm
sorry.
the
allegation
on
the
administrative
record
as
to
what
the
misuse
involved
was
a
circumstance
in
which
over
a
weekend
he
endeavored
to
drive
a
ill
child
from
his
base...
his
detail
duty
spot
in
new
york
to
the
family
home
in
virginia.
mr.
fausto
was
under
the
impression
that
since
he
had
been
detailed
and
his
detail
included
authorization
to
use
a
governmental
vehicle,
that
he
had
the
discretion
to
utilize
the
vehicle.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
yes,
your
honor,
except
as
you
and
i
understand
the
term,
i
think
we
would
characterize
if
you
drive
your
family,
it's
personal
use.
but
there
are
elements
in
the
regulations
that
indicate
that
it
may
not
be
unofficial
use
if
you
use
a
car
within
the
scope
of
the
detail
and
the
authorization
that
you
have
been
provided
for
that
car.
but
as
i
say,
that's
not
an
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
claims
court
in
terms
of
a
merit's
based
determination.
it
simply
went
to
the
propriety
of
the
back
hold
remedy.
for
a
period
of
time
not
substantially
less
than
30
years,
this
court
has
stressed
the
necessity
that
employing
agencies
adhere
to
their
regulations,
and
has
upheld
the
ability
of
employees
to
obtain
judicial
review
when
the
agencies
do
not,
at
least
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
expression
by
congress
of
an
intention
to
preclude
such
review.
the
supreme
court
in
vitarelli,
for
example,
was
unanimous
in
this
respect,
with
all
of
the
justices
indicating
that
they
subscribe
to
this
basic
proposition.
thus,
we
return
once
again
to
the
issue
that
i--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your--
mr.
john
m.
nannes
--yes,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
narrow
issue
presented
is
whether
he
was
made
whole.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
in
this
instance,
that's
is
correct.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
fausto's
claim
as
it
reached
the
claims
court
is
whether
he
had
been
made
whole
within
the
meaning
of
the
back
pay
act,
because
if
he
had
not
been
wrongfully
discharged,
he
would
have
been
on
site
and
had
other
opportunities
to
compete
for
other
government
jobs
at
a
time
when
his
position
was
otherwise
abolished.
we
submit
to
the
court,
your
honors,
there
simply
is
not
a
basis
upon
which
the
court
can
fairly
discern
that
congress
intended
to
repeal
rights
that
this
man
would
have
otherwise
had
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
the
completeness
of
the
remedy
that
he
was
awarded
by
the
agency
for
his
wrongful
discharge.
the
government
has
not
dispelled
the
substantial
doubt
that
this
was
congress'
intent.
and
the
government's
argument
based
on
statutory
scheme
makes
sense
only
if
the
court
disregards
the
legislative
history
underlying
chapter
75
itself.
if
the
court
looks
at
the
legislative
history
underlying
chapter
75,
we
submit
that
it
must
reach
the
conclusion
that
congress
did
not
have
an
intention
to
address
the
availability
of
judicial
review
of
nonpreference
excepted
service
employees.
mr.
john
m.
nannes
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
certainly
would
not
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
court
should
not
look
at
chapter
23
and
43.
but
i
think
there
is
a
limit
as
to
the
conclusions
one
can
draw
from
a
review
of
all
the
statutory
provisions.
they
have
very
different
legislative
histories
and
backgrounds,
and
they
simply,
i
would
submit,
are
unhelpful
in
educating
the
court
as
to
what
congress
may
have
intended
with
respect
to
mr.
fausto
at
a
time
that
it
enacted
chapter
75
which
merely
codified
existing
practice
and
transferred
judicial
review
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
and
thereafter
to
the
federal
circuit.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
