mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
excepted
service
employee
who
misused
a
government
vehicle.
at
issue
is
30
days
back
pay.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
although
the
civil
service
reform
act
does
not
provide
for
judicial
review
of
adverse
actions
like
the
one
at
issue,
that
respondent
had
an
implied
right
of
action
in
the
claims
court
under
the
tucker
act
and
the
back
pay
act.
in
our
view,
because
the
csra
specifically
deals
with
the
remedies
available
to
federal
employees,
including
this
employee
in
this
situation,
it
precludes
such
an
implied
right
of
action.
the
csra
draws
three
distinctions
that
need
to
be
kept
in
mind.
first,--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
this
employee
was
dismissed
for
misconduct.
the
csra
deals
with
misconduct.
it
defines
employees
not
to
include
this
employee.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
another
way
of
looking
at
that
is
that
the
csra
hasn't
provided
him
with
any
remedies.
that's
our
point.
the
provision
of
the
csra--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--this
is
an
excepted
service
employee
for
whom
it
is
assumed
that
there
need
be
no
basis
for
dismissal.
this
employee
has
no
form
of
tenure.
he
is
not
a
competitive
service
employee,
and
he
is
not
a
veteran.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
he
was
given
a
list
of
reasons.
he
was
also
allowed
to
file
a
grievance,
but
he
was
dismissed
for
use
of
a
government
vehicle.
a
statute,
a
statute
provides
that
federal
employees
may
be
dismissed
for
that.
it
also
provides
that
there
is
a
mandatory
30-day
suspension.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
true,
but
that
other
statute
gives
him
no
remedies,
and
this
statute
is
the
comprehensive
statute
covering
adverse
actions
against
federal
employees.
if
it
simply
neglected
to
deal
with
this
employee,
that
would
be
one
thing.
but
the
whole
scheme
of
the
statute
shows
that
congress
dealt
advertently
with
this
class
of
employee
in
this
situation,
and
has
provided,
as
we
have
stated,
that
the
office
of
personnel
management
could
provide
that
he
was
covered
and
had
the
rights
in
chapter
75.
it
hasn't.
in
this
situation
where
congress
dealt
with
him,
gave
him
no
rights
at
all
under
the
comprehensive
scheme
that
it
set
up,
and
provided
that
opm
could
decide
to
extend
those
rights
to
him.
what
we
think
that
the
proper
result
to
draw,
the
conclusion
to
draw
is
that
congress
didn't
want
him
to
be
able
to
go
to
court
to
complain
about
a
suspension
for
misuse
of
a
government
vehicle
unless
opm
said
that
he
could.
and
opm
has
said
that
some
employees,
excepted
service
employees
may
go
to
court
to
do
that,
but
it
did
not
grant
that
right
to
short-term
employees
like
the
respondent
here.
and
so
under
that
scheme
where
congress
hasn't
forgotten
about
him
at
all,
it
is
just
like
the
carducci
decision
where
congress
had
provided
no
remedies
in
the
case
of
reassignments,
but
had
dealt
in
great
detail
with
all
sorts
of
adverse
actions,
and
it
was
clear
that
it
had
deliberately
decided
that
federal
employees
can't
go
to
court
to
complain
about
reassignments.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
that's
right.
the
government
has
inherent
authority
to
dismiss
or
suspend
excepted
service
employees
because
it...
except
to
the
extent
that
it
has
granted
them
rights
in
the
civil
service
reform
act,
which
it
has
in
many
case,
i
might
add,
but
not
this
one.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
we
think
that's
a
close
question.
we
think
that
the
testan
decision
is
the
one
most
closely
on
point.
that
was
a
classification
decision.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
we
are
not
pursing
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
in
1963,
the
court
of
claims
held
in
the
greenway
decision
that
a
probationary
excepted
service
employee
could
go
to
court
in
certain
situations.
and
the
court
below
has
described
that
as
giving
him
a
right
to
challenge
an
arbitrary
dismissal.
and,
no,
we're
not...
i
thought
you
were
asking
the
question
sort
of
in
the
abstract
whether
greenway
was
correctly
decided
under
the
law
at
that
time.
we
think
that's
a
close
question,
but
is
no
longer
relevant
after
enactment
of
the
csra
which
we
think
precludes
this
cause
of
action.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
not
in
this
case.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
to
fire
excepted
service
employees.
this
employee
is
not
a
competitive
service
employee.
the
vast
majority
of
federal
employees
are
in
the
competitive
service.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
the
comprehensive
statute
gives
this
person
no
rights
in
this
situation.
there
is
a
very
specific
statute
dealing
with
misuse
of
government
vehicles,
and
that
was
what
was...
this
employee
committed
five
breaches,
but
it
was
the
misuse
of
the
government
vehicle
that
was
ultimately
the
basis
for
the
adverse
action
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
quoted
a
number
of
cases
in
our
brief.
it
has
long
been
assumed
that
excepted
employees,
employees
who
are
excepted
from
the
competitive
service
serve
at
will
and
have
no
property
interest
in
their
jobs,
and
may
be
terminated
without
any
process
at
all.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
and
a
number
of
courts
have
so
held.
competitive
service
employees
are,
of
course,
much
different.
competitive
service
employees
have
long
held
a
host
of
rights.
in
enacting
the
csra,
congress
complained
to
some
extent
that
it
was
assumed
by
many
people
that
it
was
impossible
to
fire
a
federal
employee
because
they
had
so
many
rights.
but
congress
was
thinking
of
competitive
service
employees
there.
excepted
service
employees
have
never
had
rights
anything
like
the
rights
granted
to
competitive
service
employees.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
it
could
have,
and
i
think
that's
undisputed.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
he
certainly
never
argued
that
he
had
any
sort
of
liberty
interest
here.
i
suppose
in
some
circumstances,
he
might.
i
don't
think
in
the
normal
instance
he
would.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
department
of
the
interior
allowed
him
to
file
a
grievance.
it
provided
that
in
a
whole
host
of
situations
employees
could
challenge
employment
decisions
by
filing
a
grievance.
opm,
in
1980,
set
forth
some
regulations
which
basically
require
agencies
to
set
up
grievance
procedures,
and
it
has
also
provided
that
except
for
those
excepted
service
employees
who
hold
policy
making
decisions,
that
those
grievance
procedures
should
generally
be
available
to
other
excepted
service
personnel
so
that
they
can
file
grievances.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
is
basically
our
argument.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
that's
not
an
adverse
action.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no.
by
adverse
action,
we're
talking
about
dismissals,
suspensions,
demotions.
in
some
cases,
it
may
cover
failures--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--and
excepted
service
employee
who
wasn't
a
veteran,
we
don't
think
there
would
be
review
there.
now
we
have
held
open
the
possibility--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
we
have
held
open
the
possibility
not
presented
here
that
in
an
appropriate
case
mandamus
might
be
warranted--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--if
an
agency
just
flatly
refuses
to
follow
its
regulation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
no,
but
that's
not
our
response,
and
an
agency
certainly
should
follow
the
regulations.
and
we
think
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
they
do.
but
in
cases
involving
relatively
small
group
of
federal
employees
which
includes
only
nonveterans
in
the
excepted
service,
i
might
add
veterans,
also
known
as
preference
eligibles,
have
basically
the
same
rights
that
competitive
service
employees
do.
but
that
nonveterans
in
the
excepted
service
do
serve
at
will,
and
except
possibly
for
a
mandamus
action,
no,
they
can't
complain
about
adverse
actions.
congress,
in
our
view,
quite
clearly
intended
that
they
not
be
able
to
go
to
court
to
do
this.
i
might
add--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes,
if
he
were
a
competitive
service
employee,
he
would
have
all
sorts
of
rights.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
ultimately
go
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
and
from
there
to
the
federal
circuit.
here
he
gets
to
file
a
grievance,
which
he
did,
and
which
he
was
awarded
seven
months
back
pay
as
a
result
of
the
grievance.
the
question
is
whether
he
should
get
30
days
more
back
pay,
and
be
able
to
go
to
court
and
claim
30
days
more
back
pay.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
interior
regulation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
we
recognize
that
that
hypothetical...
we
don't
think
it's
very
likely.
we
recognize
that
hypothetical.
and
in
a
case
like
that
where
an
employee
would
have
no
right
to
relief
under
our
view,
he
probably
could
file
a
mandamus
action.
this
comes
up
in
the
classification
cases
following
enactment
of
the
csra,
i
might
add,
and
it
is...
the
courts
have
divided
on
this,
but
some
courts
have
held
that
you
can't
even
file
a
mandamus
action
because
you
can
go
to
the
special
counsel.
now
it
is
open
to
this
employee
to
go
to
the
special
counsel
of
the
mspb
if
he
alleged
that
he
had
been
subject
to
what's
know
as
a
prohibited
personnel
practice,
which
are
11
particularly
troublesome
practices
like
nepotism.
the
act
specifically
deals
with
excepted
service
personnel,
and
provides
that
except
for
policy
making
excepted
service
personnel
you
can
go
to
the
special
counsel
to
complain
about
a
prohibited
personnel
practice.
this
respondent
does
not
allege
that
he
was
subjected
to
a
prohibited
personnel
practice.
so
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--he
was
a
temporary
employee.
he
had
worked
i
think
for
the
fda.
he
took
a
position
with
the
interior
department.
he
signed
a
piece
of
paper
at
the
time
he
took
it
acknowledging...
it's
a
very
brief
three-paragraph
acknowledgement
that's
in
the
record
that
says,
i
understand
that
i'm
becoming
an
excepted
service
employee,
and
i
have
no
rights
to
any
future
job
after
this.
and
that's
the
way
he
took
the
job.
also
as
a
condition,
which
is
on
the
form
he
filled
out
when
he
took
the
job
is
that
he
understood
that
he
would
serve
until
the
young
adult
conservation
corps
camp
at
which
he
worked
closed,
or
until
a
certain
date
in
1980,
whichever
was
earlier,
and
that
was
about
a
year
and
a
half
after
he
was
hired.
so
he
was
hired
as
a
short-term
employee.
his
position
was
placed
in
what's
known
as
schedule
a
in
the
regulations
that
list
all
the
excepted
service
positions,
because
it
was
a
short-term
position.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it's
about
20
percent.
the
excepted
service
includes--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--there
are
quite
a
few.
it
includes
certain
employees
whose
agencies
are
removed
from
the
competitive
service.
that
includes
such
things
as
the
cia,
the
defense
intelligence
agency.
it
includes
the
judicial
branch,
i'm
told.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
that's
schedule
a.
schedule
a,
the
regulations
list
about
60
groups.
there
are
policy
making
employees
were
all
in
schedule
c.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
justice
stevens,
the
office
of
legal
counsel
has
considered
that
question,
and
has
decided
that
it's
unlikely
i'll
be
subjected
to
an
adverse
action
so
i--
[laughter]
schedule
b,
working
backwards,
includes
a
lot
of
student
positions.
there
are
lots
of
student
positions
in
the
federal
government.
and
schedule
a
includes
many
short-term
jobs,
and
a
variety
of
other
jobs
that
are
in
some
ways
difficult
to
categorize:
chaplains,
attorneys,
japanese
interpreters,
employees
of
federal
mental
institutions
who
were
previously
patients
at
the
institutions,
et
cetera.
but
short-term
employees
actually
are,
i'm
told,
more
than
half
of
the
employees
in
the
excepted
service
and
schedule
a,
and
policy
making
employees
are
all
of
schedule
c.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
distinction
that
i
haven't
made
that
i
think
is
very
important,
is
the
distinction
between
chapter
43
of
the
civil
service
reform
act,
and
chapter
75.
chapter
43
governs
adverse
actions
based
on
unacceptable
job
performance.
whereas,
chapter
75
governs
adverse
actions
based
on
misconduct.
it's
undisputed
that
if
this
employee
had
been
dismissed
for
unacceptable
job
performance
under
chapter
43,
that
he
would
have
no
right
to
challenge
that
action.
chapter
43
is
parallel
to
chapter
75
in
many
ways.
it
explicitly
deals
with
each
of
the
classes
of
federal
employees.
it
says
under
that
chapter
that
excepted
service
nonveterans
have
certain
procedural
rights.
but
it
also
explicitly
states
that
only
competitive
service
employees
and
veterans,
those
with
preference
eligibility,
can
go
to
the
mspb
and
then
to
the
federal
circuit.
the
d.c.
circuit
recently
decided
in
the
harrison
case,
a
case
that
no
one
disputes,
that
an
excepted
service
employee
dismissed
for
unacceptable
behavior...
unacceptable
job
performance,
excuse
me...
has
no
right
to
go
to
court
to
complain
about
it.
we
think
that
congress
intended
the
same
in
chapter
75.
the
difference
is
that
in
chapter
75
it
has
authorized
opm
to
list
certain
excepted
service
positions
as
having
rights,
including
the
right
to
judicial
review.
so
to
some
extent,
excepted
service
employees
have
greater
rights
under
chapter
75
in
misconduct
cases.
they
do
if
opm
decides
that
they
have
those
rights.
but
opm
hasn't
included
this
group,
respondent's
group
of
excepted
service
employees
within
the...
it
has
not
given
them
the
rights
in
chapter
75.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
they
can
file
grievance
procedures
and
it's
not
presented
here,
but
one
would
think
that
in
an
appropriate
case
mandamus
might
be
warranted.
they
could
also
go
to
the
special
counsel
of
the
mspb.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
cited
one
in
our
brief
in
a
classification
case.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
if
that
isn't
the
case,
it
must
be
because
agencies
are
following
their
regulations.
i
would
be
surprised
if
there
were
many
cases
involving
federal
agencies
where
mandamus
was
granted.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
opm.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
opm
in
chapter
75.11(c).
it's
as
clear
as
day--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that
opm
can
do
this.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
think
all
that
chapter
does
is
grant
rights.
i
don't
know
that
it
does
much
else.
but
i
suppose
it
says
that
you
can
only
be
fired
for
cause,
but
that's
a
right.
so
he
is
granted
no
rights
under
the
chapter,
because
the
relevant
definitional
provision,
which
is
75.11(a)
says
that
for
the
purpose
of
this
subchapter
employee
means
an
individual
competitive
service
who
is
not
serving
a
probationary
or
trial
period.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
for
minor
adverse
actions.
that's
not
the
relevant
one
here.
it's
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
that's
the
short-term...
i
assume
you
would
make
an
analogous
argument
under
75.12.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
in
the
case
of
an
excepted
service
employee,
you
don't
need
any
authority.
so
if
you
were
covered
here,
then
it
would
give
him
a
right
only
to
be
suspended
under
regulations
that
will
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
in
the
absence
of
that,
he
doesn't
even
have
that
right.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
75.11(a)
says
employee
means
an
individual
in
the
competitive
service
who
is
not
serving
a
probationary
or
trial
period.
(b)
says
a
preference
eligible
in
an
executive
agency
in
the
excepted
service--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--and
then
part
(c)...
which
is
the
subsection
governing
major
adverse
actions,
suspensions
for
more
than
14
days
or
dismissals.
and
(c)
says,
the
office
of
personnel
management
may
provide
for
the
application
of
this
subchapter
to
any
position
or
group
of
positions
excepted
from
the
competitive
service.
so
it
is
true
that
this
employee
isn't
in
this
chapter,
but
that's
because
opm
hasn't
chosen
to
put
him
there.
and
in
the
absence
of
opm
putting
him
there,
he
has
no
rights
in
a
case
of
this
sort.
it
seems
strange
that
he
would
have
more
rights
under
chapter
75
because
he's
out
completely
than
under
chapter
43
where
he
is
in
to
the
extent
that
he
gets
certain
procedural
rights
which
are
quite
analogous
to
the
grievance
rights
that
opm
has
granted
excepted
service
employees
under
chapter
75
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that's
the
major
adverse
action
part.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no.
subchapter
1
is
minor
adverse
actions.
no
one
gets
a
right
to
judicial
review
under
subchapter
1,
and
it
has
been
argued
in
a
number
of
cases,
analogous
to
the
argument
here,
that
because
minor
adverse
actions
aren't
covered
there,
that
that
employees,
they
are
not
excluded
in
any
way;
that
employees
can
go
to
court
under
the
tucker
act
to
complain
about
minor
adverse
actions
just
as
they
can't...
we
argue
analogously
that
they
can't
here.
one
last
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
besides
being
undisputed
that
under
chapter
43
employees
cannot
go
to
court,
it
is
undisputed
that
probationary
employees
who
are
excluded
from
chapter
75,
in
the
same
sentence
that
i
just
read
of
75.11(a),
cannot
complain
about
adverse
actions
either.
and
that's
even
though
the
greenway
decision,
which
is
the
basis
for
the
implied
cause
of
action
here,
held
that
a
probationary
excepted
service
employee
was
entitled
to
go
to
the
old
court
of
claims.
we
don't
think
any
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
probationary
and
excepted
service
employees
in
the
way
they
are
treated
in
chapter
75,
and
we
think
it's
plain,
as
we
state
in
our
briefs,
that
congress
didn't
want
to
make
a
federal
case
out
of
adverse
actions
taken
against
these
sorts
of
employees.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
address
the
nature
of
what
actually
happened.
mr.
fausto
was
notified
that
the
agency
intended
to
discharge
him,
and
he
was
allowed
to
respond
to
that
before
he
was
discharged.
the
error
that
was
committed,
and
the
only
error
that
was
committed
was
that
the
agency
did
not
then
tell
him
that
he
had
a
right
to
file
a
grievance.
a
year
later,
after
the
camp
at
which
he
closed...
at
which
he
worked
had
closed,
the
agency
realized
that
it
had
made
a
mistake.
it
then
told
him
he
could
file
a
grievance.
he
did
file
a
grievance.
he
was
awarded
seven
months
back
pay;
back
pay
from
the
date
the
mandatory
30-day
suspension
would
have
ended,
until
the
camp
closed.
what
was
subsequently
held
by
the
federal
circuit
was
that
even
though
it
had
done
that
and
granted
him
his
grievance
rights,
and
even
though
a
30-day
suspension
was
mandatory,
that
somehow
the
agency
lost
its
right
to
suspend
him
for
30
days
as
a
result
of
failing
to
notify
him
of
the
right
to
filing
a
grievance
such
that
the
grievance
proceeding
occurred
late
in
the
day.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
i...
but
i
just
wanted
to
set--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--clear
that
the
only
mistake
here
was
failing
to
notify
him
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
grievance.
one
point
that's
worth
noting
is
that
one
area
that
congress
wanted
employees,
including
nonveterans
and
the
excepted
service
to
still
be
able
to
file
claims
in
court,
was
in
discrimination
cases.
and
as
we
have
pointed
out,
congress
in
section
7707
and
7702
has
very
carefully
integrated
the
procedures
in
discrimination
cases
with
the
procedures
it
set
up
in
chapters
43
and
75.
so
in
that
area
congress
wanted
to
preserve
a
right.
it
preserved
it.
the
final
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
there
are
indeed
anomalous
results
flowing
from
the
court's
decision
below.
the
amicus
has
told
us
that
even
though
it's
undisputed
that
a
veteran
competitive
service
employee
cannot
go
to
court
to
challenge
a
10-day
suspension,
he
thinks
that
an
excepted
service
employee
could.
there
is
anomaly
in
section...
chapter
43
versus
chapter
75
that
we
have
discussed.
and
finally,
there
is
a
short
of
reverse
anomaly
even
though
probationary
employees
are
excluded
from
chapter
75
in
the
same
sentence
of
the
same
subsection
as
excepted
service
employees.
it
is
thought
that
they,
of
course,
have
no
right
of
action,
whereas
this
employee
does.
we
don't
think
that's
right.
we
think
congress
clearly
meant
to
exclude
nonveterans
excepted
service
personnel
and
probationary
employees
from
going
to
court
except
in
discrimination
cases.
thank
you.
