justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
wright.
what
is
your
position
in
this
court
on
the
question
whether
prior
to
the
enactment
of
csra
there
would
have
been
a
remedy
for
this
man?
justice
stevens
i
know
you
argued
it
in
the
second
go
around
in
the
court
below,
and
they
said
it
was
perfectly...
but
i
don't
think
see
you
are
not
arguing--
justice
stevens
--so
we
start
from
the
premise
that
prior
to
csra
he
had
a
remedy,
and
that
csra
really
impliedly
took
it
away
from
him.
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
so.
doesn't
his
claim
rest
on
some
kind
of
regulation?
i'm
a
little
fuzzy
on
the
facts?
didn't
he--
justice
stevens
--and
your
position,
as
i
understand,
is
even
if
they
just
go
ahead
and
violate
those
regulations,
don't
give
him
a
hearing,
don't
do
what
the
regulation
provide,
there
is
just
still
no
provision
for
any
judicial
review.
justice
stevens
if
you
had
a
regulation
that
when
there
is
a
lot
of
snow
in
washington,
everybody
can
go
home
at
3:00
and
still
get
a
full
day's
pay,
and
the
excepted
service
people,
they
just
didn't
pay
them,
they
would
have
no
remedy.
justice
stevens
that's
not
paying
them?
justice
stevens
then
they
demoted
him
for
not
showing
up
on
a
day
he
was
told
he
could
go
home,
because
the
regulation
says
you
don't
have
to
work
past
3:00.
he
didn't
and
the
boss
says,
i
don't
like
that;
you're
fired.
there
would
be
review
of
that
with
an
excepted
service
employee.
justice
stevens
even
if
there
was
a
flagrant
violation
of
a
regulation.
justice
stevens
well.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
this
case
just
deals
with
this
class
of
employees
who
are
nonveteran
excepted
service
employees,
or
it
will,
basically
patronage
or
at
will...
i
don't
know.
but
in
any
event,
how
big
a
segment
of
the
federal
work
force
is
it?
justice
stevens
that's
a
lot
of
people
then,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
if
it
includes
all
lawyers,
you
must
have
a
conflict
of
interest.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
that's
in
75.11.
justice
stevens
when
you
use
the
term
chapter
75,
you
really
mean
subchapter
2
of
chapter
75.
justice
stevens
because
in
subchapter
1
they
don't
have
that
same
definition.
