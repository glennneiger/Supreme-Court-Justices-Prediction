justice
o'connor
mr.
nannes,
do
you
think
the
decision
below
is
consistent
with
the
carducci
case?
justice
o'connor
what
about
employees
subject
to
very
short
suspensions,
can
they
go
to
the
claims
court,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
an
employee
is
suspended
for
14
days
or
less,
there
is
no
right
to
judicial
review
under
the
csra,
is
there?
justice
o'connor
but
under
your
view
of
the
decision
below
if
we
were
to
affirm,
they
might
have
a
claims
court
remedy?
justice
o'connor
so
the
result
would
be
that
civil
service
employees
subjected
to
short-term
suspensions
would
have
no
right
to
go
to
the
claims
court
if
your
view
prevails.
justice
o'connor
but
these--
justice
o'connor
--but
these
excepted
service
employees
would
even
for
the
14-day
suspension
or
less.
justice
o'connor
it
just
seems
so
inconsistent
and
ironic.
justice
o'connor
although
it
might.
i
mean
they
just
don't
fit.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
they
argue
that
we
should
look
at
the
entire
structure
of
chapter
43
and
75,
and
the
whole
picture;
not
just
isolate
75.
