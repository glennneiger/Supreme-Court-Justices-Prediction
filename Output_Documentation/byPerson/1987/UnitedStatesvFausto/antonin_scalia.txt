justice
scalia
mr.
wright,
before
you
go
on,
am
i
correct
in
my
understanding
that
the
csra
did
not
provide
for
any
remedy
for
this
basis
of
dismissal?
but
it
also
did
not
provide
for
this
basis
of
dismissal?
that
the
basis
of
dismissal
was
a
basis
outside
the
csra?
justice
scalia
therefore,
this
employee's
misconduct,
or
the
dismissal
of
this
employee
for
misconduct
is
not
the
dismissal
of
this
employee
under
the
csra.
justice
scalia
well,
not
only
has
it
not
provided
him
any
remedies,
it
also
hasn't
provided
the
government
any
basis
for
dismissal.
justice
scalia
then
why
was
he
dismissed
for
violation
of
another
statute
outside
of
the
civil
service
reform
act.
why
wasn't
he
just
told
to
be
gone?
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
where
you
have
a
comprehensive
scheme
like
the
civil
service
reform
act
that
provides
for
the
basis
of
dismissal
of
a
particular
employee,
and
does
not
provide
any
remedy,
or
provides
remedy
only
in
certain
instances
and
leaves
out
other
ones.
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
in
that
situation
implicit
is
that
he
has
no
remedy
for
the
ones
not
listed,
but
it's
quite
a
different
situation
when
the
basis
of
dismissal
itself
is
not...
is
not
the
csra,
but
rather,
this
other
statute
upon
which
the
government
relied.
justice
scalia
but
the
difference
in
carducci
was
that
the
basis
for
dismissal
in
carducci
was
a
basis
set
forth
in
the
civil
service
reform
act
itself,
or
the
basis
action
taken
was
a
basis
set
forth
in
the
civil
service
reform
act,
unacceptable
performance.
and
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
not
what's
being
relied
on
here,
any
basis
that's
set
forth
in
the
act
itself.
justice
scalia
well,
is
it
the
same
thing
to
be
fired
for
no
reason
at
all
as
to
be
fired
for
stealing
a
car,
or
for
misusing
a
car?
wouldn't
he
have
some
constitutional
right
to
a
name-clearing
hearing
if
he
is
fired
for
that
sort
of
a
reason
anyway?
justice
scalia
your
response
is
that
that's
okay,
that
anyway
they
should
have
just
fired
him
for
no
reason
at
all
instead
of
for
not
coming
in
on
a
day
when
he
didn't
have
to
come
in.
justice
scalia
what
lets
him
file
a
grievance?
justice
scalia
and
that
could
have
been
disregarded
also
and
there
would
have
been
no
relief
except
for
mandamus.
justice
scalia
was
he
a
long...
a
long-time
employee
of
the
government,
or
a
temporary
employee,
or
what?
justice
scalia
it
includes
all
lawyers
in
the
executive
branch,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
is
it
not
true,
you
say
that
he
would
have
these
procedural
rights
if
he
had
been
included
by...
who
puts
him
in
there?
justice
scalia
by
opm
with
chapter
75.
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
but
isn't
it
true
that
opm
has
to
affirmatively
include
him
not
only
in
order
that
he
have
those
remedies,
but
in
order
that
he
be
included
within
that
chapter
at
all?
so
the
chapter
simply
doesn't
apply
to
him
unless
opm
says
so,
including
the
dismissal
provisions
and
the
adverse
actions
provisions
of
the
chapter.
he
just
is
not
an
employee
for
purposes
of
that
chapter.
justice
scalia
well,
now
wait
a
minute.
this
is
section
7503,
cause
and
procedure.
justice
scalia
well,
whatever.
it
says
under
regulations
prescribed
by
opm,
an
employee
may
be
suspended
for
14
days
or
less
for
such
cause
as
will
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
i
don't
consider
that
the
granting
of
a
right,
the
right
to
be
fired
or
suspended?
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
authority
for
the
agency
to
do
the
suspension,
no?
justice
scalia
right,
right.
i
just
happen
to
see
3
first.
but
75
not
only
gives
rights,
it
also
is
a
source
of
authority
for
disciplinary
action,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
i'm
puzzled.
i
thought
they
define
the
term
75,
it
would
just
be
from
the
competitive
service.
justice
scalia
what
about
to
other
employees?
justice
scalia
would
other
employees
continue
to
have
their
pre-existing
rights
to
get
into
federal
court--
justice
scalia
--apart
from
the
scheme
set
forth
in
chapter
75
of
getting
there
after
going
through
the
mspb?
justice
scalia
unless
the
agency
establishes
a
grievance
system
for
this
category
of
employee,
which
it
is
under
no
obligation
to
do,
the
situation
would
be
that
he
could
go
directly
to
federal
court,
whereas
those
employees
of
a
supposedly
more
protected
status
would
have
to
go
to
the
mspb.
justice
scalia
and
indeed,
in
some
cases
would
not
even
be
able
to
go
to
the
mspb;
would
have
no
relief,
depending
upon
what
the
level
of
the
sanction
was,
except
asking
the
counsel
to
consider
their
grievance,
whereas
he
would
be
able
to
go
federal
court
no
matter
what.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
a
fortunate
happenstance,
but
that
doesn't
speak
to
the
rationality
of
the
legislative
scheme
that
does
not
require
such
a
regulation
to
be
issued.
and
the
fact
is
that
in
the
absence
of
such
regulation,
he
would
come
directly
to
federal
court,
whereas
the
more
protected
employees
would
have
to
go
through
the
mspb,
and
in
some
cases
wouldn't
even
have
that
available.
they
would
have
to
go
to
the
general
counsel
with
a
discretionary
authority
on
his
part
to
press
their
grievance.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
the
case
with
his
particular
grievance,
but
you
can
have
another
grievance
that
doesn't
consist
of
the
lack
of
a
promised
hearing.
justice
scalia
something
else
that
went
wrong
in
the
adverse
action.
justice
scalia
but
do
you
agree
that
absent
some
regulation
giving
a
person
in
the
excepted
service
some
both
either
substantive
right
or
procedural
right,
that
person
is
subject
to
termination
at
will?
justice
scalia
mr.
nannes,
if
i
understand
it,
you
are
not
relying
at
all
on
the
fact
that
the
dismissal
in
this
case
invoked
the
unauthorized
use
of
the
government
vehicle
statute.
you
would
be
here
even
if
the
dismissal
had
just
been
for
no
cause
at
all.
you
would
say
that
even
on
that
basis
if
the
agency
didn't
comply
with
its
regulation,
you
would
be
entitled
to
go
to
court.
justice
scalia
the
regulatory
violations
being
what
now?
justice
scalia
wouldn't
he
have
a
right
to
grieve
if
he
had
been
fired
for
no
reason
at
all?
or
let's
say
he
was
fired
for
inefficiency.
justice
scalia
would
he
have
had
to
have
notice?
justice
scalia
is
mr.
fausto
entitled
not
just
to
judicial
review
of
whether
the
agency
had
violated
its
regulation
in
failing
to
give
him
notice,
but
also
review
of
whether
in
fact
he
had
been
guilty
of
unauthorized
use
of
a
government
vehicle
as
the
agency
asserted?
justice
scalia
i
know
that.
do
you
draw
it?
justice
scalia
why?
wouldn't
the
old
law
have
given
him
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
here
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
respondent,
joseph
a.
fausto,
became
an
employee
of
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
of
the
department
of
the
interior
in
1978.
he
was
hired
as
an
administrative
officer
for
the
young
adult
conservation
corps
camp
at
virginia
beach,
virginia.
his
position
was
to
last
for
the
duration
of
the
virginia
beach
program,
but
not
beyond
september
30,
1982.
his
status
under
the
civil
service
laws
was
not
bad
of
a
competitive
service
employee,
but
rather
that
of
what
is
technically
termed
a
nonpreference
member
of
the
excepted
service,
a
category
which
is
afforded
a
lower
level
of
statutory
protections
against
dismissal
and
other
adverse
actions.
respondent
was
suspended
from
his
job
for
30
days
for
the
unauthorized
use
of
a
government
vehicle.
after
unsuccessfully
appealing
his
suspension
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
he
filed
an
action
under
the
back
pay
act
in
the
claims
court.
that
court
dismissed
the
action
on
the
ground
that
a
nonpreference
member
of
the
excepted
service
has
no
right
to
judicial
review
of
such
a
suspension
under
the
civil
service
reform
act
of
1978
and
that
act
provided
the
exclusive
catalog
of
remedies
available
to
him.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
holding
at
the
csra
did
not
preclude
respondent
from
seeking
the
claims
court
review
under
the
tucker
act
based
on
--
on
the
back
pay
act
which
had
been
available
before
enactment
of
the
csra.
on
the
merits,
it
found
that
respondent
was
entitled
to
back
pay.
we
reversed
that
judgment.
csra
comprehensively
overhauled
the
civil
service
system
prescribing
in
great
detail
the
protections
and
remedies
available
to
civil
servants
affected
by
adverse
personnel
actions.
in
light
of
the
comprehensive
nature
of
the
act,
its
attention
throughout
to
the
rights
and
remedies
of
nonpreference
excepted
service
employees
and
the
structure
of
the
act,
we
believe
that
the
exclusion
of
these
employees
from
the
adverse
--
from
the
adverse
action
provisions
of
the
act,
which
include
the
right
of
judicial
review,
represents
a
congressional
judgment
that
they
should
not
have
a
statutory
entitlement
to
judicial
review
for
the
type
of
action
involved
here.

stevens

dissenting
opinion
joined
by

brennan
