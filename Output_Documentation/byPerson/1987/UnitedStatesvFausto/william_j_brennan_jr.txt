justice
jr.
i
gather
your
principal
reliance
is
that
this
is
a
very
comprehensive
scheme.
justice
jr.
and
yet,
you
say
while
it
doesn't
in
terms
protect
this
man--
justice
jr.
--not
in
this
case.
nevertheless
there's
inherent
authority?
justice
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
why...
why
doesn't
the
comprehensive
statute
preempt
this
so-called
inherent
authority?
justice
jr.
and
what's
the
source
of
this
inherent
authority?
justice
jr.
and
assumed.
justice
jr.
--he
said,
if
he
were
a
competitive
service
employee
and
was
charged
with
this
offense,
no
adverse
action
against
him
as
a
competitive
service
employee
except
pursuant
to
chapter
75
with
all
its
procedural
guarantees;
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
he'd
have
all
kinds
of
hearings
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
wouldn't
he?
justice
jr.
but
here
he
gets
nothing.
