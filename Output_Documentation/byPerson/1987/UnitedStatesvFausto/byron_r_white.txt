justice
white
doesn't
chapter
43
include
the
employees
in
the
excepted
service?
justice
white
and
deals
with
people
like
fausto.
justice
white
and
says
that...
and
sets
up
some
required
procedures
for
personnel
actions?
justice
white
so
the
statute
at
least
in
some
respects
does
deal
with
the
excepted
service--
justice
white
--at
least
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
the
statute
deals
with
the
excepted
service
in
chapter
43,
and
just
doesn't
provide
for
the
same
kinds
of
remedies
as
the
nonexcepted
employees.
justice
white
well,
it
must
be
that
congress
was
probably
aware
of
the
statute
it
was
passing
regardless
of
the
origin
of
the
various
chapter.
justice
white
don't
you
think
this
could
be
termed
a
discharge
for
unsatisfactory
performance?
justice
white
well,
did
he
misuse
government
vehicles
in
the
course
of
his
job?
justice
white
well,
his
claim
was
then
that
it
was
within
the
proper
performance
of
his
job.
justice
white
--have
a
determination
that
the
agency
violated
its
regulations.
justice
white
well,
it's
been
determined
already
that
his
discharge
was
unwarranted.
justice
white
well,
he
doesn't
need...
he
doesn't
need
any
court
review
to
establish
that.
justice
white
just
a
question
of
the
scope
of
his
remedy.
justice
white
--goes
to
whether
they
should
have
decided
anything?
i
mean
is
the--
justice
white
--yes.
