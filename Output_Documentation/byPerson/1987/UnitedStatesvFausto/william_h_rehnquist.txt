we
will
hear
now
from

chief

isn't
there
a
certain
irony
there
then
that
the
people
not
covered

can
go
directly
to

who
are
covered
have
to
work
their
way
up
through
the
administrative
procedure?

justice
rehnquist

was
the
source
of
the
authority
requiring
him
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies?

rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
