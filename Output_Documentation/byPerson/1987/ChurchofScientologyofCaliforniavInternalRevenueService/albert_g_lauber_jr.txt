mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
giving
my
answer
to
a
couple
of
questions
that
came
up
during
the
first
argument.
it
is
important
to
keep
returns
and
return
information
distinct
in
ones
mind
to
the
extent
one
can
with
these
abstract
phrases.
return
is
basically
the
form
1040
and
the
attached
schedule
a,
schedule
b,
schedule
c,
schedule
d,
the
return
itself.
and
those
are
protected
absolutely
from
disclosure.
the
haskell
amendment
does
not
apply
to
them,
and
they
cannot
be
disclosed
even
in
redacted
form.
return
information
is
basically
everything
else
as
we
see
it
in
the
taxpayer's
audit
file,
except
for
the
return.
there
might
be
a
report
of
the
examining
agent
showing
the
results
of
his
audit.
there
might
be
a
protest
from
the
taxpayer
protesting
the
proposed
deficiency
of
the
agent
once
set
up.
there
could
be
internal
irs
correspondence
about
the
nature
of
the
taxpayer's
claims.
there
can
be
a
notice
of
deficiency
issued
by
the
irs
to
the
taxpayer
proposing
an
increase
in
his
taxes.
there
could
be
a
tax
bill
billing
the
taxpayer
for
a
tax
deficiency.
all
these
other
things
are
return
information
because
they
are
data
that
are
either
furnished
to,
collected
by,
prepared
by
the
irs
in
connection
with
the
determination
of
that
person's
tax
liability.
now,
the
point
is,
a
lot
of
the
numbers
on
the
return
will
find
their
way
into
the
rest
of
the
file
because
if
you
audit
somebody's
charitable
contributions,
you'll
put
down
in
your
report
what
those
contributions
were.
the
point
is,
all
the
little
numbers
on
the
return
will
find
their
way
into
all
the
other
documents
that
are
called
return
information
in
the
file.
and
that
gives
a
concrete
example
of
what
the
chief
justice
asked
about.
what
we're
saying
is
all
those
other
documents
are
immune
from
disclosure.
they're
saying,
except
for
the
return,
you
have
to
redact
all
those
other
documents:
the
revenue
agent's
report,
the
tax
bill,
notice
of
deficiency,
and
then
disclose
them
in
redacted
form.
now,
justice
white
asked
a
question
about
would
the
irs
have
to
disclose
in
response
to
a
request
how
many
people
earned
income
of
$45,212?
the
answer
is,
no.
the
irs
cannot
be
required,
nor
can
any
agency,
to
create
a
new
document
by
doing
research
for
the
taxpayer,
and
saving
okay,
we
think
based
on
our
records,
there
were
572
returns
filed
of
that
sort.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
because
of
the
foia,
there's
no
requirement
for
an
agency
to
create
a
document.
if
there
were
no
list
in
the
files
when
the
request
came
in,
listing
the
number
of
guys
who
had
returns
with
that
amount
of
income,
you
wouldn't
have
to
create
such
a
list.
what
they
would
say
you
would
have
to
do
is
disclose
every
piece
of
return
information
of
people
who
had
that
amount
of
income,
removing
their
names.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
the
document
is
return
information
if
it
is
a
document
created
by
the
irs
in
connection
with
the
determination
of
liability.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it's
not
just
the
numbers
but
the
document
itself
is
return
information.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no.
as
justice
o'connor
said,
once
it
starts
life
as
return
information,
it
stays
that
way
forever.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
yes.
and
that's
a
very
good
point,
because
if
petitioners
are
right
in
their
redaction,
why
did
congress
say,
you
can't
disclose
returns
even
if
they
are
redacted,
when
the
same
numbers
are
on
the
other
stuff
in
the
file,
and
they
said
it
has
to
be.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
is
our
position.
and
we
make
that
point
in
pages
25
and
26
of
our
brief.
i
think
justices
o'connor
and
stevens
hit
on
the
key
point
in
the
case,
which
is
where
do
you
get
this
redaction
requirement.
where
does
it
come
from.
here
we
have
these
documents
like
a
revenue
agent's
report
that
is
return
information.
now,
what
is
it
that
causes
the
irs,
requires
it
to
redact
it
to
turn
it
into
something
that
is
not
return
information?
where
does
this
requirement
come
from?
it
can't
come
from
section
6103.
it
says
nothing
at
all
about
redaction.
now,
significantly
in
section
6110
which
was
enacted
in
the
same
bill
as
6103
governs
the
disclosure
of
redacted
private
letter
rulings
and
background
file
documents.
it
does
have
a
redaction
requirement
in
it.
and
although
it
was
enacted
in
the
same
bill
as
our
statute,
there's
no
redaction
requirement
in
6103.
and
i
think
that's
quite
a
telling
distinction.
rather,
petitioner
gets
the
redaction
requirement
not
from
the
taxpayer
privacy
act,
but
from
the
foia,
which
requires
that
reasonably
segregable
portions
of
documents
be
released,
once
you
redact
them
to
remove
the
foia
exempt
material.
but
this
is
really
just
circular
reasoning,
when
you
come
right
down
to
it.
the
foia
redaction
requirement
only
comes
into
play
when
you
have
a
document
that
is
subject
to
foia,
whereas
here
you
have
a
document
that
is
exempt
from
foia,
as
these
tax
related
documents
are,
you
never
get
to
the
redaction
requirement.
i
mean,
you
can't
argue
that
foia
requires
you
to
redact
a
document
to
cause
it
to
lose
its
exemption
3
status.
it's
just
circular
reasoning.
i
think
that's
what
this
court--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
think
that
does
it
for
us.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
yes.
they're
relying
entirely--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--what
they
want
is
redaction
of
individual
taxpayer
information.
they
had
to
get
that
from
somewhere.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
that
was
what
judge
scalia,
then-judge
scalia,
reasoned.
he
said
you
can't
import
this
redaction
requirement
into
the
statute.
he
then
gave
an
interpretation
of
what
this
in
a
form
language
means.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--which
i'll
get
to
now,
if
you
like.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
the
best
place
to
start
is
from
senator
haskell's
introduction
of
this
thing
on
the
floor.
it
was
introduced--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
will
inevitably
be
true
that
most
of
the
documents
covered
by
that
exemption
will
be
reformulated.
and
that's
what
senator
haskell
was
plainly
thinking
about
when
he
introduced
this
amendment
on
the
floor.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
he
said
introducing
it,
"the
purpose
of
this
amendment
is
to
insure
that
statistical
studies
and
other
compilations
of
data
now
prepared
by
the
irs
and
disclosed
by
it
to
outside
parties
will
continue
to
be
subject
to
disclosure
to
the
extent
allowed
under
present
law.
"
and
the
ensuing
few
sentences,
senator
haskell
uses
the
phrase,
"statistical
studies
and
compilations
of
data.
"
now
fewer
than
six
times.
he
referred
moreover
to
studies
and
compilations
that
were
now
prepared
by
the
irs,
that
is,
prepared
as
of
1976,
and
disclosed
by
it
to
outside
parties
at
that
time.
now,
these
remarks
by
the
amendment's
sponsor
are
the
only
explanation
of
its
purpose.
it
was
a
floor
amendment
adopted
without
a
roll
call
vote.
the
entire
history
of
it
is
one-third
of
one
page
in
the
congressional
record.
all
we
have
to
go
on
is
what
senator
haskell
said.
the
only
other
remark
was
the
floor
manager's
remark,
that
said--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--we
have
to
kind
of
come
to
that
last
because
the
language
is
the
most
difficult
part.
the
floor
manager
said
it
might
not
be
entirely
necessary,
but
good
idea,
i'll
be
happy
to
take
it
to
conference.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
seemed
to
be
his
intention,
exactly.
and
what
petitioners
here
are
asking,
they're
not
asking
for
a
compilation
of
data,
or
a
statistical
study.
they're
asking
for
individual
tax
documents
out
of
peoples'
audit
files,
a
redacted
version.
this
kind
of
stuff
was
not
redacted
and
disclosed
by
the
irs
in
1976.
it
was
exempt
under
prior
treasury
regulations.
now,
i
think
the
limited
purpose
senator
haskell
announced
for
his
amendment
on
the
floor
is
reflected
perfectly
well
in
the
text.
because
it
says,
"return
information
excludes
data
in
a
form
which
cannot
be
associated
with
a
particular
taxpayer.
"
and
clearly,
if
you
have
reformulated
data
into
a
statistical
study
compilation,
it
is
then
in
a
form
that
cannot
be
associated
with
a
particular
taxpayer.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
that's
right.
now,
i
think
if
you
didn't
have
senator
haskell's
remarks
on
the
floor,
all
you
had
to
go
on
was
the
phrase,
in
a
form,
one
could
imagine
a
document
that
would
be
return
information
that
would
be
collected
in
connection
with
a
liability.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
and
not
be
a
compilation.
for
example,
say
a
newspaper
story
about
bible
tax
shelters.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
say
an
agent
was
auditing
somebody
who
had
a
bible
tax
shelter,
and
he
cut
out
the
things
in
the
newspaper,
didn't
mention
the
taxpayer,
just
some
article
and
stuck
it
in
the
file.
that,
i
think,
you
could
say
was
in
a
form
that
could
not
be
associated.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
i
think
that
reading
should
be
rejected
in
favor
of
judge
scalia's
reformulation
test,
because
of
senator
haskell's
remarks.
he
was
talking
about
studies
and
compilations
of
data.
and
i
think
to
treat
the
words,
in
a
form,
as
meaning
a
reformulation,
is
most
consistent
with
the
sponsor's
remarks
in
introducing
his
amendment.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
okay.
i
have
a
long
answer
to
that
question.
there
are
two
parts.
first
of
all,
what
the
tax
model
was
back
then,
and
secondly,
why
it
doesn't
help
the
petitioners.
the
tax
model
is
kind
of
a
misnomer.
what
it
is
is
actually
raw
data.
it's
a
compilation
of
data
that
was
drawn
from
a
stratified
sample
of
about
100,000
individual
tax
returns.
it
was
basically
a
pile
of
numbers
on
a
computer
tape.
for
every
return
that
was
chosen
for
the
sample,
there
were
about
150
what
they
call
fields
or
like
entry
boxes,
where
you
would
put
the
numbers
for
that
sample.
about
30
of
these
entry
boxes
did
not
correspond
at
all
to
numbers
or
line
items
on
a
return.
rather,
they
were
computed
amounts
reflecting
economic
concepts
like
expanded
income
or
capital
gains
tax
at
fifty
percent
rate.
this
is
all
in
the
description
of
the
tax
model
the
irs
put
out
for
1976.
most
of
the
other
entry
boxes
on
each
sample
did
correspond
roughly
to
line
items
on
a
return
like
salaries
and
wages,
salaries
and
wages.
but
there
were
a
number
of
exceptions
from
that.
first
of
all,
the
numbers
on
the
return
would
be
corrected
for
mathematical
errors
and
to
eliminate
any
internal
inconsistencies
on
the
taxpayer's
return.
and
then
entered
onto
the
tax
model.
a
number
of
the
items
on
the
taxpayer's
return
might
be
combined
before
transferring
them
to
the
tax
model.
for
example,
if
a
taxpayer
reported
a
bonus
or
a
director's
fee
as
miscellaneous
income,
that
would
be
added
back
to
wages
and
salaries
and
combined
with
it
before
it
was
put
onto
the
tax
model.
so
it
would
be
different
treatment
from
the
return.
and
finally,
some
items
would
be
treated
differently
on
the
tax
model
for
economic
reasons
than
they
were
shown
on
the
return.
for
example,
an
earned
income
credit
which
was
shown
on
the
return
as
a
tax
payment
was
shown
on
the
model
as
a
reduction
in
tax
liability.
so
basically,
in
1976,
the
tax
model
was
a
compilation
of
data
many
of
whose
entries
were
lifted
verbatim
from
tax
returns
with
all
identifiers
removed.
but
there
also
was
some
reformulation
of
the
data
by
the
irs.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think.
some
of
the
items
were.
some
items
just
came
over
line
for
line,
some
would
be
changed,
and
new
items
would
be
added
to
the
tax
models.
so
i
think
it
was
arguably
a
reformulation
under
judge
scalia's
test.
but
what
ever
one
calls
it,
it
doesn't
help
the
petitioners
here
for
three
reasons:
first
of
all,
the
tax
model
was
plainly
a
compilation
of
data.
indeed,
senator
haskell
described
it
as
a
compilation
of
data
on
the
floor
when
he
referred
to
it.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
the
tax
model
we
think
is
covered
by
the
language
of
the
amendment,
because
we
think
it
is
in
a
form--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
because
that's
what
senator
haskell
said
his
amendment
was
meant
to
do
was
to
protect
the
continuous
exposure--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
the
return
would
not
be.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no.
we
agree
that
the
tax
model
is
disclosable.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
you
mean
if
you
only
had
one,
rather
than
100,000
of
these
things?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
okay.
i
think
i'd
agree
with
you
about
that.
but
the
key
thing
is,
it
must
be
an
existing
thing.
there's
no
redaction
requirement.
that's
the
next
point.
the
tax
model
was
something
irs
already
prepared.
it
was
right
there
in
the
file
as
is.
you
didn't
have
to
redact
it
in
order
to
make
it
something
to
be
disclosed.
and
they
want
redaction.
the
things
that
do
not
currently
exist
in
disclosable
form,
but
we
have
to
put
them
into
disclosable
form.
and
the
third
point
is
that
the
tax
model
had
been
prepared
by
the
irs,
and
disclosed
by
it
to
the
public
for
at
least
ten
years
before
1976.
it
therefore
fit
exactly
within
senator
haskell's
reference
to
documents
that
were
now
prepared
by
the
irs
and
disclosed
by
it
to
third
parties.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
yes.
that's
correct.
but
the
key
thing
is,
that
would
not
be
in
an
individual
taxpayer's
audit
file.
there
might
be--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
that's
how
we
keep
our
records,
basically.
i
mean,
what
you
would
have
there
would
be
like
a
general
scientology
file,
or
a
general
petroleum
industry
file,
with
guidelines
for
examiners
about
how
to
conduct
audits
of
that
kind
of
tax
shelter
or
that
kind
of
taxpayer.
and
those
files
would
be
searched
in
response
to
a
foia
request,
and
such
things
would
be
disclosed
because
they
are
not
collected
by
the
irs
in
connection
with
the
particular
taxpayers'
liability.
they
are
general
instructions
about
how
to
audit
a
class
of
people.
and
that
would
be
disclosable,
too.
but
you
see,
that
wouldn't
even
be
return
information.
you
don't
even
need
the
haskell
amendment
for
that
because
it
wouldn't
even
be
return
information.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
theoretically.
you
see,
this
whole
case
began
with
the
question
about
what
is
a
proper
scope
of
the
search.
and
the
irs
has
just
miles
and
miles
and
miles
of
file
documents.
and
their
position
was
all
the
individual
audit
files
of
particular
named
taxpayers
we
don't
need
to
search,
because
the
way
we
keep
our
records,
there
should
be
nothing
in
there
but
return
information.
and
it
would
simply
be
impossible
to
go
rummaging
through
all
those
files
looking
for
some,
one
little
study
that
somebody
kind
of
found
its
way
into
a
file
by
mistake.
that
study
would
appear
somewhere
else,
and
you'd
look
for
it
there.
but
judge
scalia
clearly
held
in
the
panel
opinion
below
that
if
the
irs
can
produce
affidavits
on
remand
that
a
whole
group
of
individual
audit
files,
for
example,
have
nothing
but
return
information
in
them,
they
don't
even
have
to
be
searched.
and
that
is
the
only
practical
way
to
administer
the
privacy
act.
you
can't
go
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
through
files
that
are
not
meant
to
contain
things
like
compilations
of
data
or
studies.
now,
there
are
a
lot
of
very
kind
of
technical
textural
arguments
which
we
have
made
in
our
brief.
and
i'm
not
going
to
go
through
those
things...
they're
pretty
complicated...
one
by
one.
they're
drawn
from
various
subsections
of
the
statute
we're
construing.
but
the
bottom
line
is
as
follows:
judge
scalia,
writing
for
the
majority
below,
concluded
that
petitioner's
construction
produces
nine
illogical
or
bizarre
consequences
at
various
points
in
the
statute,
whereas
his
construction,
which
we
embrace,
produced
only
two.
judge
wald,
in
dissent,
had
a
different
count.
she
tallied
up
the
score
as
only
being
5
to
3
in
the
government's
favor.
but
all
ten
judges
on
the
en
banc
court
agreed
that
as
a
matter
of
pure
textural
analysis,
our
position
is
superior
to
petitioner's,
demonstrably
superior
to
petitioner's.
the
defense
response
to
that
problem
was
to
say
that,
well,
normal
principles
of
textural
analysis
should
be
kind
of
called
off
here,
or
given
less
importance
because
the
haskell
amendment
was
a
last
minute
floor
thing
that
kind
of
made
a
mess
of
the
statute.
and
we
think
that
kind
of
agnostic
approach
just
is
unacceptable.
the
statutory
law
consists
of
the
words
that
congress
enacts.
and
you
can't
bypass
the
logical
meaning
of
those
words
or
the
logical
inferences
from
a
text
on
the
theory
that
congress
didn't
know
what
it
was
doing,
or
was
acting
hastily
or
carelessly.
another
factor,
i
think,
that
cuts
against
the
petitioner's
position
is
the
way
the
haskell
amendment
was
adopted.
as
we've
explained,
the
general
definition
of
return
information
excludes
literally
billions
of
documents
in
individual
taxpayer
files
all
around
the
country.
they
would
be
immune
from
disclosure.
petitioner's
theory
is
that
all
these
documents
become
disclosable
after
being
redacted
by
virtue
of
the
haskell
amendment.
their
interpretation,
therefore,
is
to
really
turn
the
statute
upside
down.
because
you'd
be
making
billions
of
documents--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--right,
but
the
return
may
be
only
one
of
70
documents
in
that
file.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no,
they've
agreed...
well,
they
don't
highlight
it
because
it's
bad
for
their
argument,
but
they've
agreed
all
along
because
of
the
way
the
statute's
drafted,
the
haskell
amendment
only
applies
to
(b)(2),
that
is,
return
information.
it
does
not
apply
to
returns.
they
agree
with
that,
but
they
have
not
made
a
big
deal
of
it,
for
good
reasons.
so
what
they're
saying
is
this
floor
amendment
had
the
effect
of
converting
all
these
billions
of
documents
that
under
the
committee
bill
would
have
been
absolutely
protected
into
potentially
disclosable
documents
by
virtue
of
redaction.
and
i
think
that's
quite
implausible
because
if
you
look
at
how
their
thing
was
adopted.
it
was
on
the
floor
without
debate
without
even
a
roll
call
vote.
and
only
two
senators
even
discussed
it.
it
just
seems
very
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
brought
about
this
huge
change
in
the
scheme
of
the
committee
bill
without
something
more
than
this
kind
of,
ho
hum
well,
it
might
be
a
good
idea,
let's
send
it
to
conference.
it
just
doesn't
sound
like
the
kind
of
language
congress
uses
when
their
vastly
reconstructing
a
committee
proposal.
finally,
i'd
like
to
make
a
point
about
this
court's
decision
in
baldridge
v.
shapiro.
this
was
the
case
that
held
that
raw
census
data
is
absolutely
immune
from
disclosure
under
foia.
the
census
act
provided,
much
as
our
statute
provides,
that
census
data
and
information
were
to
be
kept
confidential.
and
the
court
held
that
the
census
act
was
an
exemption
3
statute,
and
that
all
census
data
were
protected
from
disclosure
thereunder.
and
the
court
expressly
rejected
the
argument,
"that
the
confidentiality
provisions
protect
raw
data
only
if
the
individual
respondent
can
be
identified.
"
that's
455
u.s.
at
355.
the
court
clearly
rejected
any
notion
of
redacting
raw
census
data
to
remove
the
name
or
other
identifiers
of
the
census
respondents.
the
court
held
the
data
is
absolutely
protected.
and
that
shows,
i
think,
how
you
treat
redaction
under
an
exemption
3
statute.
if
information
is
protected
under
foia
exemption
3,
as
census
data
was
there,
and
is
tax
information
is
here,
its
simply
not
covered.
it's
exempt
from
foia.
you
don't
go
and
redact
it
in
order
to
make
it
subject
to
foia
by
kicking
it
out
of
the
exemption
3
status.
thank
you.
