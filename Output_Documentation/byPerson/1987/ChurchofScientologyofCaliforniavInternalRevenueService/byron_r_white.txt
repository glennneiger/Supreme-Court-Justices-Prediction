justice
white
i
would
think
the
government
would
surely
say
the
number
of
people,
certain
level
of
income,
would
be
disclosable.
you
think
it
would
not?
justice
white
well,
all
they
do
is
count.
they
count
and
come
up
with
a
number
and
it
doesn't
even
appear
in
any
piece
of
paper.
they
just
count
it.
justice
white
but
if
the
question
was
how
many
people
reported
an
income
of
$100,000,
you
would
agree
if
they
just
came
up
with
a
number?
justice
white
yes.
yes,
that's
what
i
would
like
to
know.
justice
white
but
if
the
government
just
makes
a
copy
of
a
return
in
its
entirety,
and
then
redacts,
crosses
out
any
identifiable
information,
is
that
return
information,
what's
left?
justice
white
yes.
they
just
copy
a
return
but
then
strike
out
anything
that's
identifying.
justice
white
well,
why
don't
you
say
that
you
could
take
an
actual
return
and
redact
any
identifying
materials
and
then
give
the
return
to
the
requester.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
have
to
read
it
with
the
freedom
of
information
act,
you
tell
us.
so
here's
a
return
and
here's
a
piece
of
paper
with
identifying
material
in
it
that
can
be
redacted.
justice
white
that's
because
of
the
freedom
of
information
act?
justice
white
well,
let's
suppose
that
there
is
a
document
in
the
file
that's
not
a
return,
but
by
anybody's
definition,
that
document
has
return
information
in
it?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
it's
got
some
identifying
information
in
it,
and
it
is
return
information.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
the
government
would
have
to
redact
that
document
to
eliminate
the
identifying
information?
justice
white
yes,
it's
just
a
like
a
return.
you
don't
have
to
redact
a
return.
this
is
return
information
and
is
exempt.
justice
white
well,
the
statute
exempts
return
information.
justice
white
and
just
like
it
does
returns.
and
if
returns
aren't
redactable,
i
would
suppose
other
documents
that
are
return
information
don't
have
to
be
redacted
either.
justice
white
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case?
justice
white
sir?
is
that
right?
justice
white
are
you
defending--
justice
white
--are
you
defending
then
the
court
of
appeals
decision?
is
that
the
reasoning?
justice
white
what
about
the--
justice
white
--i
was
hoping
you
would
get
to
it.
justice
white
you
don't
need
this
argument,
do
you?
justice
white
you
don't
need
the
reformulation
argument?
justice
white
okay.
go
ahead,
go
ahead.
justice
white
we've
got
the
language.
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
they
do
not
say
you
need
to
redact
a
return,
and
then
deliver
the
rest
of
the
return?
justice
white
right.
is
this
a
new
position
of
their's
or?
justice
white
why
doesn't
it
apply
to
a
return?
justice
white
i
know,
but
return
information
is
also
exempt
if
its
identified.
justice
white
all
right.
here's
a
document
that
identifies
and
is
return
information.
it's
identifying
return
information,
but
it
would
be
very
easy
to
redact
it.
and
you
say
the
redaction
has
to
take
place--
justice
white
--no.
return
information
that's
identified?
justice
white
well,
it
is
identifying
in
the
form
that
you
find
it
in
the
file,
absolutely
identifying,
just
like
the
return
is.
