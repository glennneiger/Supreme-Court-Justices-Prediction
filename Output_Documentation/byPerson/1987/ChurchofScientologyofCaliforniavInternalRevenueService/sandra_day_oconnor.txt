justice
o'connor
mr.
hertzberg,
i
think
where
i
get
confused
in
this
whole
matter
as
far
as
your
presentation
is
concerned
is
how
to
properly
relate
the
freedom
of
information
act
provision
that
says
reasonably
segregable
portions
of
a
record
shall
be
provided
with
the
exemption
provision
for
return
information,
together
with
the
haskell
amendment.
now,
the
haskell
amendment
says
that
the
term,
return
information,
doesn't
include
data
in
a
form
which
can't
be
associated
with
the
taxpayer.
i
assume
that
means
already
in
a
form
which
cannot
identify
the
taxpayer.
if
it's
already
in
that
kind
of
a
form,
then
it
simply
isn't
exempt,
as
i
read
it,
from
the
freedom
of
information
act.
i
don't
see
that
you
can
read
the
freedom
of
information
act
as
importing
some
affirmative
duty
to
redact
and
to
go
out
and
search
for
things.
that's
where
i
get
confused.
it's
either
exempt
or
it
isn't
by
looking
at
the
definition
of
"return
information"
as
amended
by
the
haskell
amendment.
am
i
right?
justice
o'connor
no?
justice
o'connor
if
it's
already
in
that
form,
then
it
is
not
exempt;
it's
disclosable.
justice
o'connor
but
it
might
also
be
in
such
a
form
even
though
it
hadn't
been
so-called
reformulated.
justice
o'connor
exactly.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
the
sponsor
also
referred
to
the
tax
model,
and
as
i
understand
it,
before
1981,
at
least,
the
tax
model
included
material
that
was
actual
nonaggregated
tax
return
information,
and
it
was
routinely
furnished.
justice
o'connor
are
you
saying
that
the
pre-1981
versions
of
the
tax
model
are
reformulated
in
fact
within
the
meaning
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below?
