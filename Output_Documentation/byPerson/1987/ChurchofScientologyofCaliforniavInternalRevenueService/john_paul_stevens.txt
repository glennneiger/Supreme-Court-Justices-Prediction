justice
stevens
can
i
interrupt
you
just
a
minute
to
get
the
example.
supposing
there's
just
one
tax
return
with
the
name
of
your
client
in
it,
a
third
party
tax
return.
do
you
contend
you
have
a
right
to
have
access
to
the
information
on
that
return,
other
than
the
identity
of
the
taxpayer?
justice
stevens
are
you
therefore
contending
that
that
tax
return
at
the
time
of
the
request
is
not
return
information?
justice
stevens
well,
in
other
words,
a
part
of
the
return
is
return
information
and
part
is
not
return
information.
justice
stevens
so
is
there
anything
in
your
view
in
the
concept
of
return
information
other
than
the
names
of
taxpayers?
justice
stevens
or
things
that
will
specifically
identify
a
return
with
a
particular
taxpayer?
justice
stevens
well,
but
potential,
i'm
talking
about
at
the
time
of
the
request,
because
i'm
not
talking
about
subsequent
reformulation
or...
see,
i
think
there's
a
big
difference
between
reformulating
in
response
to
an
foia
request
and
reformulation
that
took
place
by
the
government
preceding
the
request
when
it
prepared
some
statistical
study.
and
putting
that
to
one
side,
and
just
saying,
at
the
time
of
the
request,
is
it
your
view
that
everything
on
a
return
that
would
not
identify
that
return
with
a
particular
taxpayer
is
not
return
information?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
that
hypothetical?
there's
a
return
in
the
irs
files
with
a
$25
donation
to
the
organization
shown
on
it.
how,
at
that
time,
when
the
request
is
made,
is
that
return
in
your
view,
as
you
read
the
statute,
in
a
form
which
cannot
be
associated
with
or
otherwise
identify
directly
or
indirectly
a
particular
taxpayer?
it's
on
the
page
of
the
return
with
the
name
of
the
taxpayer
on
the
top
of
it.
justice
stevens
it's
clearly
return
information.
justice
stevens
if
it's
return
information,
then
it's
exempted
from
the
statute.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
there's
no
duty
to
segregate
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
justice
stevens
now,
explain
that
to
me.
justice
stevens
where
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
there
a
duty
to
make
something
that
is
return
information
into
something
that's
not
return
information?
justice
stevens
that's
right,
but
the
whole
return
is
exempt
when
you
start
from
it.
justice
stevens
but
at
the
time
of
the
request,
the
whole
return
is
exempt
material.
justice
stevens
[inaudible]
justice
stevens
yes,
but
my
hypothetical
is
that
the
whole
tax
return
is
return
information.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
but
the
tax
return
and
its
attachments
are
return
information.
justice
stevens
then
returns
are
never
disclosable,
you're
saying,
even
if
you
redact
them?
justice
stevens
so
the
example
we
gave,
you'd
say
that
was
not
returnable
even
if
you
redacted
the
names?
justice
stevens
if
it's
a
return.
justice
stevens
so
no
information
that's
in
the
tax
returns
themselves
under
your
view
of
the
case
must
be
produced?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
that's
not
the
answer
you
gave
to
the
hypothetical.
justice
stevens
so
you're
only
seeking
information
that
is
in
supplementary
papers
in
a
file
but
no
information
that's
in
tax
returns
themselves?
justice
stevens
i
hadn't
understood
that
before.
justice
stevens
no,
but
mr.
hertzberg,
you
overlooked
something
in
justice
o'connor's
question.
she
said,
already
in
a
form.
and
there,
if
they
have
their
own
reasons
for
making
up
studies
and
reformulating
things,
you
have
no
objection
to
that,
do
you?
but
unless
they've
done
that,
and
unless
it
can
be
looked
at
without
identifying
a
taxpayer,
how
can
you
get
around
the
plain
language
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
already
in
a
form.
i
think
justice
o'connor
put
it
very
well,
and
that's
what
the
statute
says,
in
a
form.
and
i
suppose
that
means
at
the
time
the
request
is
made.
justice
stevens
then
it
includes
everything,
of
course.
because
you
can
always
redact.
justice
stevens
no,
but
you
can
always
redact
whatever
it
is
necessary
to
preclude
identification
with
a
particular
taxpayer.
sometimes
you
have
to
take
the
name
and
address
off,
and--
justice
stevens
--sometimes
you've
got
to
take
a
little
bit
more
off.
but
you
always
end
up
with
something
that
would
be
disclosable,
i
would
think.
justice
stevens
but
what
if
he
were
wrong?
supposing
it
was
simply
a
copy
of
somebody's
return
with
the
name
taken
off?
say
they
just
used
a
sample
return
or
something
like
that,
but
it
didn't
identify
any
taxpayer.
it
had
already
been
put
in
that
form
at
the
time
without
any
reformulation,
compilation.
it
clearly
would
be
covered
by
the
language
of
the
amendment,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
it
would
be
even
if
it
were
not
a
compilation.
i
don't
see
why
you
have
to
get
into
all
this
argument
about
compilations?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
saying,
assume
he's
wrong,
and
assume
there
was
a
regularly
disclosed
piece
of
paper
that
was
a
copy
of
mr.
average
taxpayer's
return,
but
with
his
name
taken
off
of
it,
so
nobody
could
identify
it
with
mr.
average
taxpayer.
that
would
be
disclosable,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
no,
but
this
tax
model,
which
is
some
thing's
used
for
some
other
purpose,
just
happens
to
be
a
copy
of
an
anonymous
taxpayer's
return?
why
wouldn't
that...
at
least
it
wouldn't
be
return
information
because
of
the
language
it
doesn't
identify--
justice
stevens
--and
would
be
even
if
it
were
not
a
compilation.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
i
don't
see
why
the
argument
about
compilations
is
even
necessary.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
take
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
supposing
there
is
in
a
lot
of
files
a
mimeographed
commentary
on
people
who
make
deductions
by
make
contributions
to
the
church
of
the
scientologists.
i
mean,
say
we
found
a
lot
of
trouble
with
these
taxpayers,
and
we
wanted
you
to
follow
a
special
procedure
when
you're
auditing
returns
with
this
kind
of
a
deduction.
it's
a
general
thing,
it
doesn't
identify
and
in
a
lot
of
files.
now,
that
clearly
would
be
disclosable?
justice
stevens
why
is
that?
justice
stevens
well,
i
was
thinking
of
a
possible
case
where
copies
of
those
instructions
got
in
one
agent's
file
in
connection
with
his
audit
work.
he
just,
he
got
a
copy
of
them
and
he
stuck
it
in
that
file.
and
couldn't
it
be
return
information?
