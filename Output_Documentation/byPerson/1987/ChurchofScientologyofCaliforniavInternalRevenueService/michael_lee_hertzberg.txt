mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
meaning
of
the
haskell
amendment.
the
haskell
amendment
is
found
in
section
6103(b)(2)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
and
it
provides
that
the
term,
return
information,
does
not
include
data
which
is
in
a
form
which
cannot
be
associated
with
or
otherwise
identify,
directly
or
indirectly
a
particular
taxpayer.
the
en
banc
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
read
a
reformulation
requirement
into
the
haskell
amendment,
but
the
term,
reformulation,
appears
nowhere
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute;
appears
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
indeed,
does
not
even
appear
in
the
briefs
of
the
government
below.
by
reading
this
reformulation
requirement
into
the
haskell
amendment
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
held
that
data
that
is
in
internal
revenue
service
files
which
cannot
be
associated
with,
or
identify
a
particular
taxpayer
must
nonetheless
be
considered
return
information
and
generally
nondisclosable
in
response
to
freedom
of
information
act
requests
or
otherwise,
unless
it
is
also,
in
addition
to
nonidentification,
reformulated.
and
the
problem
with
this
reformulation
standard
is
that
it
is
not
articulated
in
a
very
precise
way
in
the
opinion
below.
there
is
very
little
guidance
as
to
what
is
meant
by
reformulation.
in
fact,
as
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
majority
candidly
acknowledge
in
their
opinion,
it
was
easier
for
them
to
say
what
they
felt
that
the
haskell
amendment
did
not
mean,
than
to
articulate
precisely
what
it
did
mean.
and
as
an
example
of
the
imprecision,
and
the
problems
that
are
raised
by
this
reformulation
test,
the
court
of
appeals
never
specifies
in
what
original
form
data
must
be
in
in
tax
files
before
it
can
be
properly
reformulated.
as
the
dissent
noted,
there
is
information
in
internal
revenue
service
files
in
every
kind
of
conceivable
stage
of
development,
and
yet
we
don't
know
in
what
original
form
it
must
originate
before
it
can
be
reformulated.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
your
honor,
returns
themselves
are
separately
nondisclosable
under
the
statutory
scheme.
so
i
don't
believe
that
is
an
issue
that
would
arise
in
that
context.
we
are
talking
about
discreet
data
return
information
and
whether
that
can
be
identified
with
a
particular
taxpayer,
that
was
what
congress'
purpose
was.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
sure.
your
honor,
we
would
maintain,
and
this
of
course
arose
in
the
context
of
a
freedom
of
information
act
request,
so
it's
easiest
for
me
to
respond
in
that
context.
let
us
say
a
freedom
of
information
act
request
came
in
and
to
properly
respond
to
it,
some
data
in
the
file
of
a
third
party
taxpayer
included
some
numbers
on
a
piece
of
paper
that
were
in
the
file,
and
that
would
be
somehow
comprehended
hypothetically
within
the
confines
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
request.
if
those
numbers
divorced
from
identifying
material,
and
i
will
now
just
give
as
an
example,
name,
address,
or
social
security
number,
but
by
no
means
the
exhaustive
list
of
what
could
be
associated
with
a
taxpayer,
if
that
number
were
disclosable
without
any
of
what
i
have
referred
to
generically
as
identifying
material,
it
cannot
be
linked
with
a
particular
taxpayer.
we
would
maintain
that
it
would
be
disclosable
if
it
came
within
the
term--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--i
would,
your
honor,
if
it
could
in
no
way
be
linked
to
a
particular
taxpayer,
of
course.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
well,
that
would
turn
on
whether
it
was
a
proper
request
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
i
mean,
there
are
limitations
as
to
what
the
scope
of
their
search
would
have
to
be.
but
that's
a
separate
question.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
and
in
fact,
under
the
terms,
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
but
i
don't
want
to
say,
in
a
broader
sense
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
i
don't
want
to
overstate
it.
there
is
a
general
principle
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
that
the
government
agencies
are
not
required
to
search
all
their
files
just
to
come
up
with
some
data
that
is
requested.
and
that
is
the
concept
that
i
was
thinking
of
when
i
answered
your
question.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes.
their
position,
your
honor,
i'm
quite
certain
is
that
even
if
the
data
that
you
are
implicating
in
your
hypothetical
freedom
of
information
act
request
could
not
be
linked
with
a
specific
taxpayer,
it
would
nonetheless
not
be
disclosable
unless
it
were
reformulated.
see,
we
come
back
to
this
reformulation
concept,
and
that's
what
i
am
addressing,
really.
because
this
is
the
whole
basis.
an
additional
thing
was
read
into
the
statute,
an
additional
level
of
activity,
as
it
were,
is
required
by
the
government's
reading
and
by
the
court's
reading
of
the
statute.
the
court
said
it
is
not
enough
that
the
material
not
identify
a
taxpayer,
or
not
be
associated
with
a
taxpayer,
it
must
in
addition
be
reformulated.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
well,
your
honor,
that
is
one
of
the
fundamental
problems,
here,
because
they
were
extremely
vague.
they
referred
to
a
composite
product.
they
said,
in
addition
to
the
fact
of
non-identification,
some
alteration
by
the
government
of
the
form
in
which
the
return
information
was
originally
recorded.
i'm
quoting,
of
course,
from
the
essence
of
the
holy.
that
reformulation
will
typically,
typically
consist
of
statistical
tabulation
or
some
other
form
of
combination
with
other
data,
so
as
to
produce
a
unitary
product
that
disguises
the
origin
of
its
components,
as
in
the
tax
money.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
i
am
not
sure.
perhaps,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--your
honor,
then
perhaps
i
misunderstood
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question,
because
i
understood
him
in
the
hypothetical
that
he
furnished
to
be
asking
for
the
data
of
that
level
of
income.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
just
a
number,
yes.
yes.
without
requiring
any
data
to
be
disclosed,
any
specific
data
other
than
the
number,
i
would
agree.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
well,
our
case.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
all
right.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
made
a
broad
request
for
information
in
internal
revenue
service
files
which
mentioned
the
petitioner,
and
the
part
of
the
internal
revenue
service's
response,
which
is
implicated
by
this
appeal,
was
the
internal
revenue
service's
refusal
to
search
files
where
there
was
every
indication
that
there
might
be
references
to
the
petitioner
but
these
were
third
party
tax
files,
and
the
government
claimed
that
everything
in
those
files
would
be
return
information
because
they
were
third
party
files
which
had
information
in
them
which
would
be
associated
with
or
identify
third
party
taxpayers.
so
in
this
very
case,
the
petitioner
is
being
deprived
of
any
chance
of
obtaining
information
that
the
internal
revenue
service
maintains
about
it
because
the
government
says--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--yes,
if
it
refers
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
at
the
time
of
the
request?
i
think
our
position,
your
honor,
is
clearly
any
information
in
that
return
which
does
not
identify
the
taxpayer--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--that's
right.
it's
a
definitional
exception.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
certainly.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
anything
in
the
files
that
the
internal
revenue
service
maintains
is
potentially
return
information.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes.
you
mean
from
a
return?
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
no.
i'm
sorry.
the
data
that
is
remaining
which
does
not
identify
the
taxpayer,
and
if
it
cannot
be
associated
with
the
taxpayer,
is
not
return
information
in
our
view.
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
entire
statutory
scheme
because
congress
was
concerned
with
the
improper
dissemination
of
information
from
the
internal
revenue
service
files
which
could
be
linked
to
particular
taxpayers.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
we
would
maintain
that
in
most
circumstances,
the
agency
would
have
to
agree
that
just
a
figure
would
not
identify
the
taxpayer.
you
cannot
make
a
request
saying,
we
would
like
to
see
john
doe's
return.
under
that
circumstance,
anything
you
received
in
response
to
your
foia
request
could
not
possibly
not
be
identified
or
associated
with
john
doe
because
you
are
getting
material
in
response
to
a
specific
request.
but
that's
not
our
case.
if
you
ask
for
information
about
yourself,
for
instance,
or
petitioner
in
this
case,
and
there
is
information
in
a
taxpayer's
file
which
is
responsive
to
that,
and
there
is
no
way
that
it
could
be
linked
to
john
doe,
it's
not
return
information,
and
that
is
exactly
what
congress
was
concerned
about.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
if
the
church
of
scientology
is
mentioned
in
there,
and
the
$25
donation
can
be
disclosed
without
any
chance
that
it
will
identify
or
be
associated
with
the
taxpayer--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--your
honor,
this
is
the
kind
of
determination
i
think
you're
alluding
to
perhaps
the
informed
requester
argument
that
the
government
makes,
this
is
the
kind
of
decision
that
agencies
make
all
the
time
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
and
they
work
in
conjunction
of
course
with
the
de
novo
review
that
the
courts
have
of
these
determinations
to
make
informed
decisions
that
information
will
not
identify
somebody,
or
under
other
subsections
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
for
instance,
like
subsections
4,
6
and
7,
that
they
will
not
constitute
unwarranted
privacies
or
lead
to
furnishing
information
about
investigations
that
are
underway.
this
is
the
kind
of
every
day
determination
that
is
made
by
agencies
under
the
exemption
statutes
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
at
that
moment?
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
it
is
return
information,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
except
that
you
cannot
divorce
in
our
view
the
statute
that
we're
talking
about
in
the
internal
revenue
code
from
the
duty
to
segregate
and
delete--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--but
it
is
in
the
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
all
right.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
well,
i
would
say
that
the
duty
flows
from
the
segregability
and
deletion
requirement
of
section
552(b)
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
which
says
that,
exempt
material
which
can
be
deleted
and
segregated...
excuse
me...
when
exempt
material
can
be
deleted
from
nonexempt
material--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes,
but
first
of
all,
the
court
below,
your
honor,
found
that
the
section
6103(b)(2)
was
a
freedom
of
information
act
(b)(3)
exemption
statute,
so
they
must
be
read
together.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
that's
correct.
we
prevailed
on
that
issue
in
the
court
below,
your
honor,
against
the
vigorous
opposition
of
the
government.
they
did
not
cross
petition,
and
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
below
found
that
the
two
statutes
were
entirely
harmonious.
and
when
we
read
them
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case,
you
may
take
return
information,
your
honor,
which
is
return
information
in
the
first
instance,
and
if
it
can
be
deleted
from
and
separated
out
from
other
information,
which
is
not
exempt
information--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--well,
your
honor,
tax
returns
per
se
cannot
be
disclosed
under
section
6103(a).
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
haskell
amendment
is
in
the
definitional
section
for
return
information,
a
distinction
is
made
in
the
statutory
scheme
between
returns
and
return
information.
there
is
a
general
prohibition
against
release
of
returns
and
return
information
in
6103(a).
in
(b),
there
are
separate
definitional
sections
of
return
and
return
information
and
the
haskell
amendment
appears
solely
in
the
definitional
section
for
return
information.
so
congress
itself
made
the
distinction.
and
that's
a
very
critical
distinction.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
that's
correct,
if
it's
a
return.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
and
i'm
sorry
because
i
think
that
i--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--i
was
just
going
to
say.
i
think
i
misunderstood
the
question
and
i
was
just
going
to
try
to
retrench
on
those
very
grounds.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
it's
my
fault
i
did
not
make
that
clear.
i
misunderstood
the
question.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
if
that
is
in
the
return,
would
it
be
excluded?
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes,
your
honor.
so
that
i
can
be
clear
on
this,
the
statutory
scheme
excludes
disclosure
of
returns,
and
that
is
not
the
issue.
we
are
talking
about
return
information
and
part
of
the
definition
of
return
information
in
6103(b)(2)
is
the
haskell
amendment.
and
that's
all
we're
talking
about.
we're
talking
about
apparent
information
about
the
petitioner
in
this
case
responsive
to
the
petitioner's
freedom
of
information
act
request,
which
is
in
third
party
taxpayer
files,
but
not
in
returns.
we
are
talking
about
other
data,
return
information.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
your
honor,
you
couldn't
do
that
without
implicating,
associating
and
identifying
material,
because
if
you
name
somebody
else,
and
you
get
a
response,
then
any
information
you
get
in
response
to
the
request
which
named
a
taxpayer
would
clearly
always
be
identified
with
that
taxpayer
or
associated
with
that
taxpayer.
and
that's
why
in
our
case,
the
petitioner
never
said
we
want
to
know
what's
in
files
of
such
and
such
person
or
such
and
such
organization
about
ourselves.
they
said
we
want
information
in
internal
revenue
service
files
about
ourselves,
and
as
it
turns
out,
there
is
apparently
a
good
chance
of
considerable
information
about
the
church
of
scientology
of
california
being
in
third
party
files.
but
the
church
presumably,
the
petitioner
here,
if
the
kind
of
process
which
is
undergone
by
agencies
all
the
time
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
indulged
in,
will
never
be
able
to
associate
anything
they
receive
in
response
to
their
request
with
a
particular
taxpayer.
they
won't
know
what
file
it
came
from,
if
the
agencies
and
the
courts
supervise
the
process.
and
that
is
one
of
the
real
problems
here
with
the
interpretation
of
this
reformulation
test
that
was
imposed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
because
it
would
play
havoc
with
the
freedom
of
information
act
insofar
as
it
applies
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
i
don't
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
the
phrase
in
the
haskell
amendment
says
that
data
which
doesn't
identify
and
can't
be
associated
with
a
taxpayer
is
not
return
information.
and
in
our
view,
when
you
read
the
two
statutes
together--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--well,
you
know,
the
government's
position
and
the
court
of
appeals'
position
below
was
that
even
a
piece
of
information
or
data
in
a
file
which
in
its
original
form
is
not
combined
with
any
identifying
material
is
also
still
return
information.
they
would
maintain
that
that
can't
be
disclosed.
we
think
that
as
with
many
of
the
other
exemptions
for
the
freedom
of
information
act
having
to
be
narrowly
construed,
having
to
be
read
in
favor
of
the
broad
mandate
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
disclose,
if
you
can
take
data
which
may
be
combined
with
other
data
which
does
identify
and
reasonable
segregate
it
from
that
identifying
data,
and
delete
the
identifying
data,
it
must
be
disclosed
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
and
the
implication
of
not
reading
it
that
way
is
the
following.
there
is
no
duty
to
reformulate
files
for
the
internal
revenue
service
or
any
other
agency.
they
would
have
blanket
immunity
virtually
from
the
freedom
of
information
act
if
the
reformulation
test
which
was
imposed
in
the
court
below
is
affirmed
here.
because
they
will
be
able
at
their
own
discretion
to
either
reformulate
or
not
reformulate
files.
the
irs
has
a
penchant
for
labeling
things,
return
information.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
plain
language
supports
our
position.
as
i
understand
your
comment,
when
you
say,
if
it's
in
a
form,
means
it's
original
form.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
we
would
maintain
that,
in
a
form,
means,
and
could
mean
nothing
more
than
in
the
manner
of,
that
if
it's
disclosable
in
a
manner
which
does
not
identify,
we
think
that's
a
plausible
reading
which
cannot
be
associated
with
a
taxpayer
or
identify
the
taxpayer.
if
it
means
more
than
that,
i
don't
know
why
it
does
not
mean
the
action
in
conjunction
with
the
freedom
of
information
act,
data
which
is
in
one
form
which
can
be
reasonably
segregated
from
other
data
which
identifies
and
released
after
deletion.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
when
you
say,
that
would
include
everything?
data
which
does
identify
a
taxpayer
or
could
be
linked
with
a
taxpayer
could
not
be
under
any
circumstances
disclosed.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes,
you
could.
and
that
is
what
congress
was--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--not
always,
because
if
it
cannot
be
reasonably
segregated,
then
it
doesn't
have
to
be
disclosed.
if
it
would
require
the
agency
to
completely
reformulate
the
document,
it
would
not
have
to
be
disclosed
under
the
principles
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
but
if
it
can
be
reasonably
segregated
from
identifying
material,
we
maintain
that
it
would
have
to
be
released.
otherwise,
it
would
be
conferring
blanket
immunity
on
the
internal
revenue
service
to
maintain
their
files
in
their
sole
discretion
to
either
allow
for
the
release
or
prevent
the
release
of
particular
data
in
their
files.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
your
honor,
congress
exempted
returns.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
because
the
general
prohibition
in
the
statute,
your
honor,
would
act
as
an
absolute
withholding
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
as
well.
the
(b)(3)
exemption
says
that
if
a
statute
precludes
something
from
being
disclosed,
it
can't
be
disclosed.
and
the
way
6103
is
structured,
congress
specifically
exempted
returns
from
disclosure,
although
it
did
not
make
the
same
provision
for
return
information.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
please.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
the
baldridge
case
is
fairly
illustrative
of
a
different
kind
of
statute
and
a
dispositively
different
kind
of
result
was
reached
in
that
case
because
the
statute
itself
was
a
blanket
prohibition
against
the
release
of
census
data.
the
analogy,
if
there
would
be
one,
between
the
baldridge
census
data
statute
and
our
case
would
be
if
the
census
data
act
provided
that
raw
census
data
which
does
not
identify
or
cannot
be
associated
with
the
person
furnishing
the
data
is
not
census
data.
that
would
be
the
proper
analogy.
that's
what
makes
our
case
different
from
baldridge,
and
that's
why
you
cannot
ignore
the
freedom
of
information
act
read
in
conjunction
with
the
haskell
amendment.
the
haskell
amendment
says
something
that
is
not
return
information
if
it
doesn't
identify.
in
the
census
statutes,
this
court
found
without
question,
a
blanket
prohibition
against
disclosure.
that
is
a
classic
freedom
of
information
act
(b)(3)
withholding
language.
this
category
of
materials
under
no
circumstances
will
ever
be
disclosed.
that's
an
easy
case.
but
when
it
says,
this
category
of
materials
will
not
be
disclosed
unless
it
cannot
be
identified
with
or
associated
with
a
person,
you
have
an
absolutely
different
situation.
and
that's
why
we
cannot
ignore,
as
the
government
would
here,
the
freedom
of
information
act,
because
the
two
statutes
must
be
read
together
as
the
three
judge
panel
below
said.
and
the
way
they
are
read
together
is
that
the
blanket
prohibition,
the
(b)(3)
freedom
of
information
act
withholding
prohibition
pertains
to
return
information.
but
the
haskell
amendment
tells
us
that
return
information
does
not
include
data
which
does
not
identify
or
cannot
be
associated
with
the
taxpayer,
and
that
is
where
the
deletion
and
reasonable
segregability
provision
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
applies.
and
it
applies
to
everything.
it
applies
under
exemption
1
to
national
security
documents.
there
can
be
a
document,
and
if
there
is
a
portion
which
does
not
comprise--
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
--your
honor,
congress,
for
reasons
that
i
cannot
discern
from
the
legislative
history
and
which
was
specifically
not
referred
to
by
my
colleague
here,
made
a
distinction
between
returns
and
return
information
in
the
statute.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
with
a
return?
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
return
information
because
that's
exactly
what
the
plain
language
of
the
haskell
amendment...
the
haskell
amendment
says
if
it
doesn't
identify,
it's
not
return
information.
mr.
michael
lee
hertzberg
yes,
your
honor.
that
may
be
correct,
but
the
freedom
of
information
act
provides
that
if
you
can
release
something
which
can
be
segregated
and
which
cannot
be
specifically
withheld,
it
must
be
released.
and
the
"in
a
form"
language,
we
maintain
that
the
in
a
form
language
can
refer
to
that
exactly.
