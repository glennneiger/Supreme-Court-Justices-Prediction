chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
86-472,
church
of
scientology
of
california
versus
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
hertzberg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
about
your
position,
mr.
hertzberg?
i
realize
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
but
would
you
say
that
an
individual
income
tax
return
should
be
available
if
the
information
that
allowed
you
to
identify
a
taxpayer
were
redacted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
well,
now
where
do
you
and
the
government
differ?
i
mean,
what
kind
of
thing
do
you
say
should
be
available,
in
a
kind
of
a
concrete
illustration,
and
the
government
says
shouldn't
be
available?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
supposing
the
freedom
of
information
act
request
was
for
the
number
of
people
who
had
reported
a
gross
income
of
$76,855
last
year?
now,
you
would
say
that
should
be
disclosable?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that
the
government
should
have
to
collect
that
information
for
you,
in
effect?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
is
it
your
understanding
that
the
government
would
say
that
is
not
required
to
be
disclosed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
let's
stay
away
from
the
peculiarities
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
and
concentrate
on
the
tax
aspects.
is
it
your
understanding
that
the
government
in
this
case
says
that
a
freedom
of
information
act
request
for
all
taxpayers
who
report
a
gross
income
of
a
particular
figure
is
not
disclosable?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what,
to
the
extent
that
you
can,
did
the
court
of
appeals
mean
by
it
being
reformulated?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
any
example
readily
occur
to
you
of
things
like
what
we're
talking
about
where
you
think
it
should
be
disclosed
and
the
government
doesn't,
some
kind
of
concrete
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
how
do
you
tell
that?
whether
information
can
in
fact
be
linked?
i
mean,
what
about
a
particular
individual's
report
of
his
gross
income
for
that
year?
just
the
figure
of
gross
income?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
if
i
give
$25
to
the
church
of
scientology
ten
years
ago,
and
you
come
in
and
ask
irs
for
any
file
that
mentions
the
church
of
scientology,
they
should
disclose
the
fact
that
an
unknown
taxpayer
gave
$25
to
the
church
of
scientology
according
to
a
return
in
their
possession
ten
years
ago?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
does
the
irs
know
whether
there's
any
chance
it'll
identify
me
or
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
including
the
$25
contribution
on
the
return
to
the
church
of
scientology?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
in
my
hypothetical
return.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
the
freedom
of
information
act
doesn't
have
any
standing
requirement,
does
it?
it's
not
as
if
you
would
have
to
ask
about
information
concerning
you
in
other
people's
files.
supposing
you
just
want
to
go
in
and
ask
for
information
about
someone
else
in
third
party
files?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hertzberg.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
lauber.
chief
justice
rehnquist
he
said
the
idea
was
to
confirm
an
existing
practice
of
the
irs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lauber.
mr.
hertzberg,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hertzberg.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
86-472,
the
church
of
scientology
of
california
versus
the
internal
revenue
service.
section
6103
of
the
internal
revenue
code
lays
down
a
general
rule
that
returns
and
return
information
shall
be
confidential.
this
confidentiality
of
return
information
is
modified
by
the
so-called
"haskell
amendment",
which
provides
that
such
term
does
not
include
data
in
a
form
which
cannot
be
associated
with
or
otherwise
identified
directly
or
indirectly
a
particular
taxpayer.
petitioner,
the
church
of
scientology
is
requested
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
data
from
the
irs
and
it
argued
that
the
haskell
amendment
removed
from
the
confidentiality
protection
of
6103
all
return
information
that
does
not
by
identify
a
particular
taxpayer.
it
also
believes
that
the
irs
has
an
obligation
to
delete
identification
from
all
return
information
and
disclose
the
information
when
requested
to
do
so
under
foia.
we
disagree
and
hold
that
the
mere
deletion
of
identifiers
from
otherwise
protected
return
information
does
not
deprive
of
its
confidential
nature.
neither
the
language
nor
the
legislative
history
of
section
6103
suggests
this
intent.
since
such
deletion
will
not
make
protected
information
disclosable,
we
hold
the
irs
has
no
duty
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
undertake
such
redaction.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
held
the
same
way.
justice
brennan
and
justice
scalia
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
