justice
blackmun
how
old
is
he
now?
justice
blackmun
is
that
your
definite
submission
here?
a
bright
line
at
age
18?
justice
blackmun
of
course,
16
would
not
save
mr.
thompson
anyway,
would
it
not?
justice
blackmun
was
the
effect
of
those
photographs
raised
below?
justice
blackmun
on
the
sentencing
phase?
justice
blackmun
is
this
because
of
their
submersion
for
almost
a
month?
justice
blackmun
i
did
not
hear
the
last
part,
"it
would
be
in
your
view.
"
what?
justice
blackmun
then
you
would
say
the
same
thing
to
those
states
which
do
not
have
the
death
penalty
for
adults?
justice
blackmun
i
am
merely
saying
that
your
argument
would
apply
to
states
without
the
death
penalty
equally?
justice
blackmun
what
about...
suppose
thompson
had
been
ten
years
old?
what
would
be
your
position
then?
justice
blackmun
it
would
be?
justice
blackmun
what
about
12?
justice
blackmun
then
you
see,
what
i
am
going
to
do
is
i
am
going
up
the
ladder...
where
would
you
draw
the
line?
justice
blackmun
but
you
would
say
that
any
ten-year-old,
no
matter
where
he
is,
may
not
be
executed?
