mr.
lee,
does
it
come
down
to
the
fact
that
you
recognize
that
the
eighth
amendment
would
allow
you
to
enforce
the
15-year
limit,
but
we
cannot
put
it
at
the
18-year
limit?
is
that
your
point?
justice
marshall
that
you
can
set
the
15-year
limit,
but
this
court
cannot
set
the
18-year
limit?
justice
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
you
agreed
that
it
could
be
done
at
15?
justice
marshall
did
you
not
say
that?
justice
marshall
did
you
not
say
that
you
could
understand
that
15
years
was
good
enough?
justice
marshall
what
did
you
say
was
15
was
for?
justice
marshall
what
minimum
age
would
you
give?
justice
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
marshall
i
would
say
that
our
educational
system
and
our
government
and
everything
else
has
sure
progressed
from
blackstone.
has
it
not?
justice
marshall
pointed
out
why
we
cannot
do
it.
why
we
cannot
set
a
huge
bright
line
at
18.
justice
marshall
would
that
involve
murder
and
rape?
justice
marshall
murder
and
rape
are
federal
charges.
justice
marshall
treason?
