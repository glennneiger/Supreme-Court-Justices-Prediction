justice
o'connor
mr.
tepker,
do
you
think
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
to
execute
a
minor
who
has,
for
example,
reached
the
age
of
17
years
and
nine
months,
at
the
time
the
offense
is
committed,
and
who
is
found
on
an
individual
determination
to
have
the
moral
culpability
of
an
adult?
justice
o'connor
yes,
i
know
you
do,
but
my
question
is,
do
you
think
that
it
is
a
per
se
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
under
the
circumstances
i
describe?
justice
o'connor
in
the
abortion
context,
this
court
has
held
that
a
minor
can
and
must
be
treated
as
an
adult
upon
proving
her
individual
maturity
to
be
so-treated.
and
yet
you
say
in
this
context,
we
may
not
do
that
and
the
constitution
says
we
may
not.
that
is
a
little
bit
inconsistent,
perhaps.
justice
o'connor
well,
did
the
petitioner
challenge
the
certification
process
in
this
case
either
at
the
trial
or
at
appellate
court
level?
justice
o'connor
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
constitutionally
insufficient
or
inadequate?
justice
o'connor
did
the
petitioner
asks
the
trial
court
to
instruct
the
jury
to
consider
age
as
a
mitigating
factor?
justice
o'connor
did
the
petitioner
object
when
the
trial
court
told
the
jury
that
he
had
been
certified
as
an
adult?
justice
o'connor
and
did
he
raise
the
point
in
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals?
justice
o'connor
mr.
lee,
when
is
the
last
time
that
a
state
in
this
country
has
executed
someone
in
this
country
that
was
under
sixteen
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
murder?
justice
o'connor
has
oklahoma
ever
executed
anyone?
