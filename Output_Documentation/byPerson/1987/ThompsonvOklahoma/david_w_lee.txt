mr.
david
w.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
my
view,
this
case
involves
two
questions:
whether
it
was
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
impose
the
death
sentence
upon
the
petitioner
in
this
case;
and
whether
this
court
should
set
as
an
aspect
of
the
united
states
constitution
a
minimum
chronological
age
under
which
no
state
could
go
in
imposing
the
death
sentence
regardless
of
the
circumstances
of
the
individual
crime
irrespective
of
the
individual
of
the
defendant's
maturity
and
background
in
each
individual
case.
in
the
present
case,
the
petitioner
murdered
the
victim
one
and
one-half
months
prior
to
the
petitioner's
16th
birthday.
the
petitioner
had
nine
contacts
with
law
enforcement
officers,
seven
of
which
occurred
prior
to
the
murder
in
this
case;
four
of
those
incidents
involved
assaults
on
a
person
and
two
of
those
involved
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon.
testimony
at
trial
revealed
that
petitioner
announced
to
witnesses
as
he
left
his
house
on
the
night
of
the
murder,
"we
are
going
to
kill
charles.
"
the
victim
died
after
having
been
brutally
beaten;
having
his
throat
cut;
and
having
been
shot
in
the
back
of
the
head.
after
the
murder,
the
petitioner
told
witnesses
on
two
different
occasions
that
he
had
cut
the
victim's
throat
and
shot
him
in
the
head.
the
petitioner
made
other
several
other
callous
comments
after
the
murder
that
revealed
that
he
felt
no
remorse,
a
fact
that
was
corroborated
by
the
testimony
by
the
psychologist
who
examined
him
and
by
his
juvenile
officer.
concerning
the
question
of
the
petitioner's
age,
the
state
contends
that
the
adoption
of
the
petitioner's
argument
that
this
court
should
set
a
minimum
chronological
age
would
require
this
court
to
engage
in
artificial
and
arbitrary
line
drawing
with
regard
to
the
decision
whether
to
impose
the
death
sentence
upon
a
young
murderer.
in
its
decisions
over
the
past
eleven
years,
this
court
has
stressed
the
need
for
individualized
decisions,
regarding
the
death
sentence.
and
we
contend
also
that
there
is
no
reason
why
age
should
be
given
any
greater
consideration
or
any
greater
weight
than
any
other
mitigating
circumstances
such
as
those
involving
mental
retardation
or
mental
illness.
furthermore,
a
significant
class
of
violent
criminals
in
this
country
should
not
automatically
be
immunized
from
the
possibility
of
receiving
the
death
sentence.
it
is
unquestioned
that
this
court
has
itself
recognized
in
the
eddings
case
that
young
criminals
increasingly
engage
in
violent
crime
and
to
announce
in
advance
that
none
of
them,
under
any
set
of
circumstances,
could
receive
the
death
sentence
regardless
of
the
maturity
that
they
displayed
or
the
viciousness
of
the
crime
that
they
commit
would
be
in
our
view,
to
send
the
wrong
message.
mr.
david
w.
lee
that
to
announce
in
advance
that,
under
no
circumstances,
regardless
of
the
maturity
the
individual
defendant
displayed
or
irrespective
of
the
viciousness
of
the
crime
that
that
defendant
committed,
we
feel
that
would
send
the
wrong
message
to
other
potential
young
murderers
in
this
country.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
we
think
that
the
individual
states
should
be
allowed
the
discretion
whether
to
impose
the
death
penalty
or
not.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
of
course
those
states
have
the
right
to
choose
whether
or
not
they
want
to
impose
the
death
penalty
on
a
person
of
any
age,
and
we
think
that
if
a
state
chooses
to
announce
to
the
potential
killers
in
that
state,
that
in
appropriate
circumstances,
if
they
commit
a
particularly
vicious
act,
they
too
are
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
mr.
david
w.
lee
justice
stevens
asked
that
question
of
me
in
the
eddings
case
in
1981
and
i
told
him
at
that
time
in
my
view
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
to
impose
the
death
penalty
on
an
individual
that
is
ten
years
of
age.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes.
we
concede
that
it
would.
that
would
obviously
be
too
young.
mr.
david
w.
lee
we
do
not
think
that
this--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--we
do
not
think
that
this
court
should
decide
in
advance
what
that
minimum
age
should
be.
we
think
this
court
should
merely
look
at
the
facts
in
each
individual
case
and
review
what
oklahoma
has
done
in
this
individual
case.
right
now
there
are
no
people
on
death
row
in
america
and
there
have
not
been
who
are
under
the
age
of
15
years
old
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
think
that
there
would
be
common
and
unanimous
agreement
among
all
people
that
that
would
be
too
young
for
an
individual
to
receive
the
death
penalty.
however,
we
think
the
country
is
divided
with
regard
to
the
minimum
age
with
imposing
of
the
death
sentence.
mr.
david
w.
lee
in
1948
there
was
an
execution
of
an
individual
who
was
sixteen
years
of
age.
mr.
david
w.
lee
no,
your
honor.
we
have
never
executed
anybody
under
the
age
of
18
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
but
we
think
that
we
should
be
able
to
in
view
of
changing
conditions
make
the
decision
in
an
appropriate
case.
i
am
glad
to
say
that
we
do
not
have
a
lot
of
young
people
on
death
row
in
our
state.
and
nationwide
i
am
glad
that
that
is
not
the
case.
but
we
think
that
individual
states,
if
they
have
made
a
careful,
individualized
consideration
as
to
an
individual's
maturity
and
background,
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
impose
the
death
penalty
in
this
case.
this
is
an
individual...
mr.
tepker
has
talked
about
the
fact
that
young
people
are
impulsive
or
immature...
that
is
not
the
case
in
this
particular...
in
mr.
thompson's
case.
he
had
a
number
of
previous
contacts
with
law
enforcement
officials.
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
would
get
him
into
trouble.
the
particular
act
in
this
particular
case
was
not
an
impulsive
act.
we
agree
that
young
people
may
be
generally
impulsive,
but
the
fact
is
that
this
individual
defendant
did
not
commit
an
impulsive
act.
it
was
a
considered
act.
the
fact
that
he
had
a
motive
to
kill
his
ex-brother-in-law
shows
even
more
that
it
was
calculated
and
planned
and
it
was
certainly
not
an
impulsive
act.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
violate
anybody's
sense
of
decency
under
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
obviously,
this
court
is
going
to
be
the
arbiter
as
what
do
constitute...
what
does
constitute
a
situation
that
would
violate
the
consensus
of
the
public
in
this
country
that
an
execution
of
a
person
of
a
particularly
young
age
would
be
unconstitutional.
but
we
think
that
the
fact
that
there
are
19
states
in
this
country
that
allow
the
execution
of
an
individual
under
the
age
of
16,
i
think
you
ask
people
generally,
and
they
are
divided,
particularly
if
you
show
them
the
individual
facts
of
individual
murder
cases,
for
example
the
case
that
this
court
heard
last
term,
the
christopher
burger
case.
if
you
ask
general
public
opinion
about
what
should
be
done
with
that
individual,
and
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
lot
of
people
in
this
country
that
would
agree
that
he
should
be
executed.
this
particular
case
involves,
i
think,
a
very
serious
crime,
although
the
victim
in
this
case
was
not
a
particularly
appealing
person,
he
underwent
a
very
horrible
murder;
he
had
his...
the
pathologist
testified
that
all
of
the
wounds
that
he
had
inflicted
upon
him
were
inflicted
on
him
while
he
was
still
alive
until
the
time
that
he
was
shot
in
the
back
of
the
head,
so
i
think
that
this
particular
case,
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
individual
had
had
previous
contact
with
law
enforcement
officials,
i
do
not
think
that
this
particular
case
involves
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
we
also
contend
that
a
rule
of
constitutional
law
that
would
set
a
minimum
chronological
age
for
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
would
make
no
allowance
for
any
increase
in--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
not
at
the
age
of
15.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
he
is
asking
for
18.
and,
but
then--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--i
am
saying
that
this
court
does
not
have
to
say
what
that
minimum
chronological
age
would
be.
i
am
saying
that
there
is
nobody
on
death
row
in
america
that
is
under
the
age
of
15.
there
are
four
that
are
now.
since
1984
there
have
been
six
that
are.
but
i
am
saying
that
this
court
does
not
have
to
say
in
advance
in
absence...
excuse
me?
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
or
at
any
time.
i
do
not
see...
like
i
said,
there
has
been
nobody
that
has
been
14
or
under
who
has
received
the
death
penalty
in
this
country
in
recent
years,
and
i
am
just
asking
the
court
to
make
an
individualized
consideration
in
this
case
as
it
insisted
the
states
do
in
other
death
penalty
cases.
mr.
david
w.
lee
since
1984
in
my...
according
to
my
calculation
there
have
been
six
individuals
under
the
age
of
16.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
they
were
all
fifteen
years
of
age.
mr.
david
w.
lee
there
have
been
none
carried
out
and
at
the
present
time,
there
are
three
that
are
presently...
of
those
fifteen,
there
are
three
that
are
presently
on
death
row:
mr.
thompson,
the
individual
in
indiana,
and
another
individual
in
north
carolina.
mr.
david
w.
lee
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
lee
there
has
been
a
problem
nationally
with
imposing
the
death
penalty
on
people
of
any
age.
there
have
been
only...
approximately
95
executions
in
this
country
since
1967,
although
there
are
2,000
people
on
death
row.
and
obviously,
juries
and
sentencers
and
appellate
judges
in
this
country
are
going
to
be
careful
with
regard
to
the
death
penalty
being
imposed
on
a
young
person,
and
we
certainly
welcome
that.
we
think
that
the
certification
hearing
conducted
by
oklahoma
in
this
case
revealed
that
there
was
a
careful
consideration
in
individual
judgment
with
regard
to
this
individual
defendant's
maturity
and
responsibility.
we
think
that
it
is
important
that
in
1971
congress
in
hearings
involving
the
26th
amendment
adopted
the
testimony
of
dr.
margaret
meade
and
others
who
testified
that
the
age
of
maturity
had
declined
three
years
since
the
18th
century.
and
it
is
also
significant,
i
think,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
in
1984,
congress
lowered
the
age
for
possible
transfer
in
federal
criminal
prosecution
from
16
to
15
years
of
age.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
and
that
is
21.
and
i
do
not
think
that
anybody
should
say
that
21
should
be
the
bright
line.
the
fact
that
chronological
age
is
an
inherently
poor
criterion
for
making
a
decision
whether
or
not
somebody
should
have
the
death
penalty
imposed
on
them.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
think
it
would
be...
i
am
sorry,
justice
marshall,
i
did
not
hear
the
first
part
of
your
question?
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
do
not
think
that
15
should
necessarily
be
the
limit.
i
am
saying
that
15
years
is
the
lowest
person
we
have
on
death
row
in
this
country.
mr.
david
w.
lee
no,
i
am
saying--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--no,
your
honor.
if
i
said
it--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--no,
i
did
not
say
that
15
should
be
the
minimum
age.
mr.
david
w.
lee
justice
blackmun
asked
me
if
12
should
be
the
minimum
age,
i
think
was
the
last
age
that
he
asked
me,
and
i
said
at
that
point
that
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
needs
to
decide
in
advance
what
the
minimum
age
would
be.
mr.
david
w.
lee
if
i
had
to
pick?
mr.
david
w.
lee
if
there
was
any
bright
line,
and
i
have
thought
about
this
for
six
years
since
eddings,
and
of
course
i
thought
about
it
before
eddings,
if
i
had
to
pick
a
particular
bright
line,
if
there
was
a
case
directly
before
this
court,
if
there
is
any
bright
line,
age
14
is
the
age
of
common
law
age
incapacity,
and
this
court
in
two
previous
cases,
the
gault
case
and
the
ford
case,
which
you
yourself
wrote,
justice
marshall,
you
used
the
common
law
as
the
guideline
for,
in
that
particular
case,
for
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
on
somebody
who
was
insane.
also,
blackstone,
in
his
commentaries
on
page
23,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
pointed
out
that
from
seven
to
14
is
the
common
law
age
of
presumed
incapacity.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
yes,
your
honor.
but
you
are
asking
for...
me
to
tell
the
court
what
that
bright
line
is,
and
the
court
used
blackstone
when
it
pointed
out--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--i
think
it
is
unnecessary
for
the
court
to
do
so,
particularly
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
court
has
said
from
griggs
on
that
a
defendant
should
receive
individualized
consideration;
that
there
should
be
allowances
made
for
the
imposition...
for
the
jury
to
impose
mercy
in
a
particular
case;
what
is
important
that
an
individual's
character
and
background
should
be
viewed
by
the
jury.
that
was
done
in
this
case.
it
was
done
by
the
certification
judge
before
the
individual
was
certified
to
stand
trial
as
an
adult;
it
was
viewed
at
the
time
that
the
jury
made
the
decision;
they
found
the
existence
of
an
aggravating
circumstance;
he
was
free
to
introduce
evidence
of
any
mitigating
circumstance;
he
received
an
instruction
that
the
youthfulness
of
the
offender
had
been
offered
as
evidence
of
mitigating
circumstances.
and
we
think
that
this
individual
defendant,
his
attorney
argued
in
his
closing
argument
in
the
second
stage
that
age
was
a
consideration;
in
their
own
brief
they
pointed
out...
i
took
one
statement
by
the
prosecutor
out
of
context,
but
the
record
shows
that,
particularly
on
page
160,
the
prosecutor
specifically
told
the
jury
that
in
the
second
stage
of
the
trial,
that
age
is
a
relevant
mitigating
circumstance...
a
comment
he
made
at
least
two
times
during
the
voir
dire
examination.
so
we
think
that
as
long
as
the
jury,
and
the
jury
has
traditionally
been
held
to
be
that
link
to
evolving
standards
of
decency
in
the
community,
and
justice
stevens
in
his
dissent
in
spaziano
said
as
much.
in
this
particular
case,
12
people
heard
all
this
evidence
and
made
the
decision
that
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed.
and
we
think
that
it
was
appropriate.
it
has
been
observed
that
chronological
age
is
an
inherently
poor
criterion
standard
by
which
to
draw
the
line
with
regard
to
criminal
responsibility.
we
have
noted
in
our
brief
that
all
federal
and
state
courts
that
have
considered
the
issue
have
rejected
the
proposition
that
there
is
one
uniform
age
that
the
constitution
sets
as
that
below
which
a
state
can
never
go
in
imposing
the
death
sentence.
in
fact,
the
existence
of
certification,
transfer,
and
waiver
statutes
in
this
country--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--i
think
that
it--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well...
i
am
saying
that
there
is
a
bottom
somewhere.
mr.
david
w.
lee
that
there
would...
i
am
saying
that,
by
age...
by
age,
there
would
be.
but
i
am
saying
that,
particularly
that,
with
what
they
want,
they
want
the
age
that
would
save
the
client
in
this
particular
case,
and
an
age
they
say
is
18
and
there
are
any
number
of
ages
that
could
be
selected
and
there
are
any
number
of
ages
that
have
been
selected
by
the
different
states.
and
we
think
that
the
states
should...
are
the
proper
entity
to
decide,
what
the
minimum
age
should
be,
is
all
i
am
saying.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
am
saying
that,
if
there
was
a
case
that
came
up
where
the
legislature
had
set
the
age
at
ten
and
a
ten-year-old
person
was
on
death
row,
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
under
the
"cruel
and
unusual
punishment"
clause.
mr.
david
w.
lee
in
1948
there
was
a
sixteen-year-old
that
was
executed
in
this
country.
as
far
as
the
actual
fifteen-year-old
further
back
than
that,
i
am
not
sure.
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
this
individual
is
one
and
a
half
month
prior
to
his
sixteenth
birthday.
mr.
david
w.
lee
no,
we
do
not
think
so.
we
think
that
is
what--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--i
am
unable
at
this
time
to
recall
what
that
figure
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
lee
in
all
honesty,
i
cannot
remember.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
am
unable
at
this
time
to
recall
what
that
figure
was,
your
honor.
i
am
sorry.
obviously
it
is
something
that--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--i
cannot
remember.
obviously
we
want
to
be
very
careful
with
this
and
i
am
glad
that...
i
am
not
coming
here
saying
that
there
have
been
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
young
persons
who
have
been
executed
and
therefore
it
is
constitutional.
i
think
it
is
good
that
in
this
country
that
the
individual
sentencers
and
the
individual
legislatures
have
been
careful
with
regard
to
this
decision.
all
i
am
saying
is
in
particular
cases
involving
individuals
like
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
like
christopher
burger,
like
kevin
stanford,
like
individuals
like
that,
for
committing
their
particular
vicious
crime,
that
if
the
particular
act
has
been
reviewed
as
it
was
in
this
particular
case
by
a
certification
judge
and
then
by
a
jury,
that
the
state
should
be
free
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
as
i
have
stated,
we
have
only
had
95
executions
in
this
country
since
1967,
which
means
it
is
very
rare
and
infrequent.
but
i
do
not
think
that
should
be
the
basis
for
abolishing
the
death
penalty
in
this
country.
i
mean,
the
states
have
tried
to
impose
the
death
penalty--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
there
has
got
to
be
a
bottom
somewhere.
at
some
point
there
is
going
to
be
a--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--i
think
in
this
day...
particularly
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
that
this
was
a
"street-wise"
individual.
he
has
had
nine...
or
before
the
murder
he
had
seven
contacts
with
law
enforcement
officials;
this
is
an
individual
who
is
aware
of
what
might
happen
to
him
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
he
was
going
to
be
picked
up
by
law
enforcement
officials--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--yes,
and
i
know
that
particularly
justice
blackmun
has
been
concerned,
like
in
his
dissent
in
the
burger
case,
he
was
concerned
about
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
domination
by
other
individuals.
in
this
particular
case,
this
individual
was
tried
separately;
there
was
nothing
like
there
was
in
the
burger
case
that
would
prevent
his
attorney
from
presenting
mitigating
circumstances
with
regard
to
this
case;
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
this
individual
acted
under
the
domination
of
anybody
else.
he
certainly
had
enough
family
members
that
testified
that
could
have
testified
if
mr.
thompson
at
one
point
had
said
that
his
family--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
there
was
one
half-brother
that
was,
but
he
made
statements
to
a
number
of
family,
or
at
least
close
friends,
to
family
members...
there
were
certainly
plenty
of
family
members
around
that
could
have
testified
that
he
made
the
comment
that
he
did
this
because
he
was
afraid
of
tony
mann
or
because
they
made
him
do
it.
the
record
is
clear
in
this
case
that
this
individual
acted
of
his
own
free
will
and
volition
in
this
particular
case,
and
there
is
no
inference
whatsoever
that
he
was
dominated
by
any
of
these
other
individuals.
as
i
have
noted,
we
think
that
the...
it
is
important
that
the
states...
even
states
that
have
set
a
minimum
age
for
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence,
cannot
agree
on
what
that
minimum
age
should
be.
and
it
was
unclear
until
the
oral
argument
what
the
petitioner
himself
thinks
the
minimum
age
should
be.
we
believe
that
common
sense
tells
us
that,
if
asked
what
the
minimum
age
for
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
should
be,
most
people
would
say
that
it
depends
on
the
individual
facts
of
the
case,
including
the
seriousness
of
the
crime
and
what
that
individual
defendant
is
really
like.
we
contend
that
the
objective
factors
of
this
case
do
not
support
the
petitioner's
position.
as
we
have
noted,
all
state
supreme
courts
that
have
ruled
on
this
issue,
have
rejected
the
contention
that
age
alone
should
bar
imposition
of
the
death
sentence.
nineteen
states,
as
i
have
noted,
permit
the
execution
of
a
person
who
was
under
the
age
of
16
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
by
my
count,
there
are
presently
38
persons
on
death
row
in
this
country
who
are
under
the
age
of
18
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
these
were
people
who
were
sentenced
by
judges
and
juries
in
14
different
states.
in
a
one-year
period
of
time
from
1985
until
1986,
three
persons
who
were
17
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
murder,
were
executed.
we
contend
that
there
is
no
unambiguous
trend
in
this
country
with
regard
to
the
raising
or
lowering
of
the
age
for
the
death
sentence.
as
i
previously
mentioned,
congress
in
1984
lowered
the
age
for
transfer
for
violent
crimes
from
16
to
15,
which
in
my
view...
also
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
that,
under
the
federal
air
piracy
act,
which
was
mentioned
by
this
court
in
the
mccleskey
case,
a
fifteen-year-old
person,
if
he
is
properly
transferred
pursuant
to
the
certification
transfer
statutes,
could
receive
the
death
penalty
if
the
procedure
is
adequate.
therefore,
the
general
public
sentiment
and
the
objective
factors
that
would
justify
the
abolition
of
the
death
penalty
for
young
murderers
is
not
present.
we
think
that
the
crime
itself
is
relevant
in
proportionality
principles.
one
who
reads
the
facts
in
many
of
these
cases
cannot
help
but
think
that
individual
states
and
individual
juries
are
justified
in
imposing
the
death
sentence
in
those
cases.
in
the
present
case
the
petitioner
was
convicted
and
sentenced
because
of
his
direct
role
in
a
calculated,
savage
murder.
he
was
certified
to
stand
trial
as
an
adult
after
two
hearings,
one
where
the
certifying
judge
determined
prosecutive
merit;
another
when
the
judge
weighed
six
factors
under
our
certification
statute.
i
might
note
that
our
certification
statute
is
very
similar
to
the
federal
transfer
statute,
title
18,
section
5032.
these
factors
included
first
the
willful
nature
of
the
act;
whether
the
crime
involved
an
act
against
the
person;
another
consideration
made
by
the
certifying
judge
was
the
sophistication
maturity
of
the
petitioner
in
his
distinguishing
right
from
wrong
as
determined
by
his
psychological
evaluation;
his
home;
his
environmental
situation;
his
emotional
attitude
and
pattern
of
living;
and
finally
the
record
and
past
history
and
prospects
for
rehabilitation.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
think
that
is
the
only
one,
your
honor,
the
federal
air
piracy
act;
that
is
the
only
one
that
i
know
of.
we
note
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--excuse
me?
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
i
do
not
know
if
at
the
present
time
that
is
a
possible
punishment
for...
if
it
is
possible
under
federal
law
for
receipt
of
the
death
sentence.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i
think
right
now
that
air
piracy
is
the
only
one,
your
honor.
it
was
mentioned
specifically
by
this
court
in
a
footnote
in
the
mccleskey
case,
and
i
do
not
know
of
any
others.
the...
i
might
note
that
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
made
note
of
the
fact
that
there
should
be
an
attempt
for
rehabilitation.
we
contend
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
the
beneficiary
of
a
number
of
rehabilitative
efforts
in
this
case
over
the
years.
he
received
counselling;
he
received...
he
had
a
tour
at
a
home
outside
of...
in
oklahoma
city;
he
received
probationary
services;
he
had
a
test...
had
testing
done
on
him
done
six
months
before
the
murder,
and
none
of
these
seemed
to
make
any
difference,
a
fact
revealed
to
him...
a
fact
testified
to
by
the
probation
officer
at
the
time
he
was
certified.
i
want
to
note
before
i
close
that
in
their
brief,
the
petitioner
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
tenth
circuit
has
said
that
our
"aggravating
circumstance,
especially
as
heinous,
atrocious
or
cruel.
"
has
been
found
by
the
tenth
circuit
to
be
overbroad.
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
"aggravating
circumstance"
that
was
mentioned
was
mentioned
in
the
reply
brief.
it
was
not
mentioned
until
that
time.
the
instruction
in
the
particular
case
is
not
the
same
instruction
that
was
used
which
is
the
subject
of
the
cartright
v.
maunard
case.
in
this
particular
case,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
"the
aggravating
circumstances,
the
heinous,
atrocious
or
cruel,
the
murder
must
be
preceded
by
torture
or
serious
physical
injury.
"
so
we
think
that
the
structure
of
this
case
is
different
than
the
one
out
of
the
tenth
circuit,
which
to
mention
out
of
the
reply
brief,
that
it
sufficiently
narrows
the
class
of
people
that
are
subject
to
the
death
sentence.
does
the
court
have
further
questions?
