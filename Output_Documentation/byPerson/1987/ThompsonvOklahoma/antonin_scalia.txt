justice
scalia
what
jurisdictions
that
have
criminal...
that
have
capital
punishment...
it
is,
of
course,
irrelevant
with
respect
to
those
jurisdictions
that
have
chosen
not
to
impose
capital
punishment
at
all.
but
as
to
those
that
have,
you
say
about
half
of
them
would
not
have
allowed
this
sentence?
justice
scalia
we
really
have
no
idea
what
they
would
think
about
youth
as
a
factor,
had
they
chosen
capital
punishment:
they
simply
have
not
chosen
capital
punishment.
we
have
no
idea
if
they
have
not
chosen
it
for
the...
for
adults
or
for
youthful
offenders.
so
it
really
says
nothing
about
whether
if
they
did
have
it
they
would
consider
that
youth
is
a
factor
that
would
render
it
absolutely
intolerable.
justice
scalia
we
would
not
have
capital
punishment
at
all
if
we
were
to
be
bound
by
that,
would
we
not.
justice
scalia
does
the
federal
government
place
any
limitation
upon
age
with
regard
to
the
statutes
in
which
it
allows
capital
punishment
to
be
imposed?
not
the
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
scalia
that
goes
to
the
question?
justice
scalia
not
of
juveniles,
but
there
are...
there
is
a
death
penalty
in
the
federal
code.
is
there
any
limitation
upon
the
imposition
of
that
upon
juveniles?
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
you
do
not
know
that
there
is?
justice
scalia
but
you
have
accepted
that,
i
thought?
you
have
accepted
that?
justice
scalia
well,
all
right.
that
is
all
we
are
arguing
about
then.
what
age
it
should
be
set
at?
justice
scalia
i
understand.
but
then
do
not
argue
to
us
why
a
rule
of
constitutional
law
establishing
a
chronological
age
is
bad,
because
you
have
accepted
a
rule
of
constitutional
law
that
uses
a
chronological
age,
have
you
not?
justice
scalia
we
do
not
have
to
say
it
in
this
case?
justice
scalia
but
you
do
not
agree
with
that?
justice
scalia
you
are
really...
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
arguing
two
different
lines:
your
argument
you
are
now
supporting
says
that
there
cannot
be
any
minimum
age.
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
above
ten,
anyway?
justice
scalia
every
person
under
18
is
not
sophisticated
and
calculating?
