justice
stevens
but
mr.
tepker,
no,
but
they
said
that
in
saying
they
were
not
relevant
to
the
determination
of
guilt.
justice
stevens
so
we
do
not
really
know
whether
they
thought
they
were
really
relevant
to
the
determination
of
the
appropriate
death
sentence...
the
appropriate
penalty.
they
just...
there
is
nothing
in
their
opinion
that
tells
us
whether
they
thought
they
could
appropriately
be
considered
in
connection
with
sentencing.
justice
stevens
it
gave
no
indication
one
way
or
the
other
on
admissibility
in
the
sentencing
hearing,
that
is
all
i
am
saying.
justice
stevens
that
is
not
what
we
are
asked
to
do.
that
does
not
win
you
your
case.
it
seems
to
me
the
relevant
statistic
would
be
what
percentage
of
the
states
have
aligned
that
would
have
rendered
this
sentence
inappropriate.
justice
stevens
you
are
arguing
that
we
should
not
set
it
lower
than
nay
legislature
has
set
it,
i
suppose
is
one
thing
that
you
have
said?
justice
stevens
you
can
argue
statistics
a
million
different
ways,
but...
is
it
correct,
i
think
you
said
that
there
had
been
no
actual
execution
carried
out
of
a
defendant
who
was
15
or
younger
at
the
time
of
the
crime
since
1948?
something
like
that?
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
it
would
not
be
a
different
case
if
it
was
fifteen
and
a
half,
instead
of
fifteen
years?
justice
stevens
but
i
am
just
wondering
to
what
extent...
there
are
statistics
in
these
exhibits
and
all
about
juveniles
and
so
forth,
but
do
we
know
how
many,
say
since
the
turn
of
the
century,
how
many
defendants
who
were
under
sixteen
at
the
time
of
the
offense
had
actually
been
executed
in
the
whole,
say,
last
100
years?
justice
stevens
is
it
more
than
a
handful,
do
you
know?
justice
stevens
i
could
not
figure
it
out
either.
are
there
any?
justice
stevens
it
might
be
zero?
justice
stevens
one
of
the
reasons
i
am
trying
to
explore
this
is
you
express
i
think
very
appropriately
the
concern
about
sending
the
wrong
message
to
potential
offenders
who
are
under
16.
of
course,
if
you
assume
that
they
are
very
brilliant
and
knowledgeable
about
what
is
happening
in
the
criminal
justice
system
in
the
last
century,
i
do
not
suppose
that
it
is
much
more
of
a
deterrent
to
have
one
out
of...
you
know,
one
every
fifty
years,
than
to
have
none
at
all.
justice
stevens
there
is
a
lot
of
difference
between
95
in
three
or
four
years
and
none
in
100
years.
justice
stevens
i
said
there
is
a
lot
of
difference
between
95
in
five
or
six
years,
whatever
it
is,
and
only
one
or
two
in
a
century.
justice
stevens
but
i
am
just
focusing
on
the
deterrence
argument
at
this
point.
justice
stevens
i
suppose
if
you
talk
about
the
particulars,
there
were
several
people
involved
in
the
killing
here,
were
there
not?
justice
stevens
some
of
his
family
was
involved
in
the
crime,
were
they
not?
justice

the
second
case
that
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
86-6169,
thompson
against
oklahoma,
which
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
that
state.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
and
sentenced
to
death.
the
principal
question
presented
is
whether
the
execution
of
that
sentence
would
violate
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
the
infliction
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
because
petitioner
was
only
15
years
old
at
the
time
of
his
offense.
the
authors
of
the
eighth
amendment
drafted
a
categorical
prohibition
against
the
infliction
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishments,
but
they
did
not
define
the
contours
of
that
category.
they
delegated
that
task
to
future
generations
of
judges
who
have
been
guided
by
the
evolving
standards
of
decency
that
marked
the
progress
of
a
maturing
society.
in
performing
the
task
in
capital
punishment
cases,
the
court
has
reviewed
the
work
product
of
state
legislatures
and
sentencing
juries
and
has
carefully
considered
the
reasons
why
a
civilized
society
may
accept
or
reject
the
death
penalty
in
certain
types
of
cases.
in
this
case,
the
opinions
that
have
been
filed
all
agree
with
the
proposition
that
there
is
an
age
below
which
a
juvenile's
crimes
can
never
be
constitutionally
punished
by
death.
for
reasons
stated
in
separate
opinion,
one
filed
by
justice
o'connor
and
the
other
which
i
have
filed
and
which
is
joined
by
justice
brennan,
justice
marshall
and
justice
blackmun,
we
conclude
that
the
death
sentence
may
not
be
carried
out
in
this
case.
justice
o'connor's
opinion
stresses
the
fact
that
every
single
american
legislature
that
has
expressly
set
a
minimum
age
for
capital
punishment
has
set
that
age
at
16
or
above.
when
one
adds
those
18
states
to
the
14
that
have
rejected
capital
punishment
completely,
it
appears
that
almost
two-thirds
of
the
state
legislatures
have
definitely
concluded
that
no
15-year-old
should
be
exposed
to
the
threat
of
execution.
in
my
opinion,
i
review
additional
evidence
of
state
legislative
decisions
that
draw
the
line
between
childhood
and
adulthood
in
different
ways
in
different
parts
of
the
country.
this
legislation
is
consistent
with
the
proposition
based
on
the
long
history
of
our
law
that
the
normal
15-year-old
is
not
prepared
to
assume
the
full
responsibilities
of
an
adult.
we
also
review
the
experience
of
sentencing
juries
that
indicate
how
uncommon
it
is
for
a
person
under
16
years
of
age
to
be
sentenced
to
death.
finally,
relying
in
part
on
opinions
authored
by
justice
powell,
we
endorsed
the
proposition
that
less
culpability
attaches
to
a
crime
committed
by
a
juvenile
and
to
a
comparable
crime
committed
by
an
adult.
we
explained
why
neither
of
the
two
principle
societal
purposes
on
which
the
court
has
relied
to
uphold
the
death
penalty,
retribution,
and
deterrence
of
capital
crimes
by
prospective
offenders
supports
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
upon
a
15-year-old
offender.
because
we
are
not
persuaded
that
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
for
offenses
committed
by
persons
under
16
years
of
age
has
made
or
can
be
expected
to
make
any
measurable
contribution
to
the
goals
that
capital
punishment
is
intended
to
achieve.
its
infliction
involves
nothing
more
than
the
purposeless
and
needless
imposition
of
pain
and
suffering
and
is
therefore
an
unconstitutional
punishment.
thus,
for
the
reasons
stated
at
greater
length
and
the
opinions
filed
by
justice
o'connor
and
by
me,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
the
criminal
appeals
is
vacated.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
white
have
joined.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
