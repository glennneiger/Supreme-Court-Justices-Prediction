justice
white
and
half
of
them
would
allow
it?
justice
white
did
the
trial
judge
not
say
that
the
jury
could
take
youth
into
consideration
as
a
mitigating
circumstance
here?
justice
white
do
you...
count
the
number
of
states
who
authorize
the
death
penalty
for
people
under
15?
do
you
count
them
the
same
as
your
opponent?
justice
white
anyway,
so
your
only
apart
by
no
more
than
one?
