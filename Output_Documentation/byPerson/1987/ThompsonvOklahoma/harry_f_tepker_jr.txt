mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
oklahoma
has
decided
that
a
fifteen
year
old
boy
lost
his
moral
entitlement
to
live
because
he
committed
a
brutal
murder,
the
killing
of
the
ex-husband
of
his
sister.
according
to
the
prosecution
evidence
the
motive
for
this
murder
was
revenge,
revenge
for
the
ex-husband's
abuse
of
the
boy's
sister.
this
case
comes
before
this
court
on
certiorari
to
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals.
petitioner
asked
this
court
to
vacate
the
sentence
of
death,
but
not
the
judgment
that
wayne
thompson
was
guilty;
and
not
the
judgment
that
he
deserves
punishment.
two
basic
issues
in
this
case
relate
to
one
fundamental
principle:
the
principle
that
youth
bears
on
the
fundamental
justice
of
the
death
penalty
and
emotion
and
prejudice
do
not.
first,
does
this
principle
require
a
minimum
chronological
age,
or
at
least
standards
and
instructions
that
tell
the
sentencing
authority
that
their
examination
of
non
adulthood
should
not
be
truncated.
second,
did
introduction
of
inflammatory
photographs
of
the
murder
victim's
decomposing
remains
undermine
the
reliability
of
this
death
sentencing
process?
wayne
thompson
was
still
a
child
under
state
law
when
he
shot
and
killed
the
ex-husband
of
his
sister.
according
to
the
prosecution's
most
incriminating
evidence,
the
boy
on
the
night
of
the
murder
shortly
after
the
crime,
confessed
to
his
mother
and
explained
to
her
that
his...
sister
"would
not
have
to
worry
about
her
ex-husband
any
more.
"
wayne
was
certified
to
stand
trial
as
if
he
were
an
adult.
the
jury
was
told
that
he
was
an
adult.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
youth
is
a
relevant
mitigating
circumstance
they
could
consider,
but
they
were
not
told
that
youth
is
a
relevant
mitigating
circumstance
of
great
weight.
they
were
told
that
they
could
decide
for
themselves
what
were
and
were
not
mitigating
circumstances.
these
were
the
instructions
before
the
jury
that
sentenced
wayne
to
death.
under
these
circumstances
and
in
a
very
real
sense,
this
case
comes
before
the
court
presenting
this
court
with
the
first
opportunity
to
decide
whether
or
not
wayne
thompson
was
too
young
to
be
condemned
to
death.
we
submit
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
as
well
as
under
circumstances
generally
applicable
to
a
class
of
children
and
adolescents,
it
is
most
inappropriate
under
the
eighth
amendment,
under
the
prohibition
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
to
inflict
the
death
sentence.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
he
is
20
now,
your
honor.
the
reasons
for
treating
youth
in
a
special
manner
have
been
recognized
by
this
court
on
a
number
of
occasions.
we
submit
that
these
factors,
these
reasons
for
treating
youth
in
a
special
way
are
compelling
in
this
particular
circumstance:
first
children
and
adolescents
are
simply
too
inexperienced
to
be
judged
by
the
same
standards
applicable
to
adults.
they
have
not
been
around
long
enough
to
formulate
the
understanding,
the
capacity
for
self-control,
to
be
judged
by
standards
according
to
adults.
the
question
is
not
merely
whether
they
know
the
difference
between
right
or
wrong,
but
whether
they
have
the
experience
to
apply
those
standards,
to
resist
the
stress,
the
trauma,
the
difficulties...
of
particularly
difficult
occasions.
we
submit
that,
in
addition
to
that,
it
is
quite
plain
that
children,
adolescents,
are
far
more
vulnerable
to
volatile,
impulsive,
self-destructive
behavior,
and
this,
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
past,
is
grounds
for
treating
youth,
youths,
in
a
different
manner,
particularly
when
the
punishment
is
death.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
your
honor,
we
argue
for
a
minimum
chronological
age.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
18
is
the
most
dominant
traditional
definition
of
non-adulthood,
and
in
this
situation,
when
you
are
short
of
eighteen,
the
chances...
excuse
me?
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
defining
the
reality
and
significance
of
adulthood
for
a
non-adulthood
for
purposes
of
inflicting
the
death
sentence,
and
making
that
same
calculation
when
what
is
at
stake
is
the
fundamental
right
of
privacy.
those...
that
balancing,
that
inquiry,
is
not
the
same,
and
i
do
not
suggest
that
bellotti
v.
baird
or
other
cases
which
recognize
the
difficulties
here,
block
this
particular...
case.
i
must
insist
that
the
question
you
pose
is
not
the
question
before
this
court
in
one
sense.
wayne
thompson
was
not
certified
to
stand
trial
as
an
adult
because
he
had
a
maturity
beyond
his
years.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
he
did
challenge
it
at
the
appellate
court
level,
your
honor,
and
his
appeal--
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
--on
kent
v.
u.s.
grounds,
yes,
but
we
are
not
relying
upon
those
at
this
point.
that
time
has
passed.
the
question
really
here
is
whether
the
certification
process
negates
the
need
for
some
focused
attention
on
non-adulthood
in
relation
to
the
death
penalty?
certification
proceeding
is
not
geared
toward--
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
--he
did
not,
your
honor.
well,
excuse
me:
he
did
ask
for
an
instruction
that
youth
was
cited
by
the
defense
as
a
mitigating
factor.
but
the
more
particular
instruction
that
we
suggested
in
our
brief
were
not
requested
by
trial
counsel.
we
submit,
however,
that
trial
counsel
did
present
the
issue
of
youth.
appellate
counsel
did
argue
the
per
se
issue.
and
we
submit
that
it
would
be
most
unusual
if
this
court
took
away
from
itself
the
opportunity
to
decide
the
issue
on
narrower
grounds.
and
that
is
why
in
my
response
to
your
initial
question,
trying
to
suggest
that
18
years
of
age
is
the
appropriate
generalization
line
for
defining
the
significance
of
non-adulthood
versus
adulthood--
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
--that
is
the
one
that
seems
most
logical
to
us
based
upon
tradition.
but
we
do--
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
--it
would
indeed,
your
honor.
and
if
this
court
took
the
position
that
it
wanted
a
greater
consensus
and
it
wanted
to
establish
a
floor
that
was
truly
a
minimal
floor,
the
fact
that
no
state,
having
decided
to
select
and
express
limitation
on
the
death
penalty,
has
selected
an
age
below
16,
might
make
16
indeed
the
most
logical
line
for
purposes
of
federal
constitutional
law.
we
have
attempted
to
provide
the
range
of
alternatives
that
would
be
necessary
to
resolve
this
case.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
there
are
indeed,
your
honor.
but
60
percent
of
the
jurisdictions
in
this
country,
encompassing
70
percent
of
the
population,
would
not
tolerate
this
execution.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
no.
that
is
60
percent
of
the
states
total.
it
is
approximately
half
of
the
states
that
retain
the
death
penalty,
establish
minimum
lines
that
would
not
allow
this
execution.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
half
of
them
allow
the
potential
for
it,
although
i
might
add,
if
one
takes
into
account
the
more
general
question
of
whether
youth
bears
upon
the
fundamental
justice
of
the
death
penalty,
oklahoma
is
one
of
only
three
states
that
has
neither
a
minimum
line
nor
any
special
legislative
declaration
that
youth
is
a
mitigating
circumstance.
and
it
is...
the
only
one
of
those
three
states
to
have
someone
on
death
row
who
is
a
juvenile.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
he
did,
your
honor.
but
then
he
said,
"what
is
a
mitigating
circumstance
is
up
to
you
to
decide.
"
we
submit
that
that
violates
the
spirit
of
eddings
v.
oklahoma,
in
which
this
court
said,
"youth
is
a
relevant
mitigating
circumstance
of
great
weight,
and
it
violates
the
principle
was
stated
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
skipper,
which
you
joined,
which
says
youth
bears
directly
on
the
fundamental
justice
of
the
death
penalty.
"
the
instructions
left
the
jury
with
the
impression
that
they
had
complete
discretion
over
the
matter.
moreover,
the
jury
was
told,
contrary
to
the
legal
facts,
that
he
was
an
"adult",
when
they
asked
that
question
of
the
trial
judge.
the
trial
judge
responded,
"yes,
he
is
an
adult.
"
he
was
a
"child"
under
the
laws
of
oklahoma.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
absolutely.
your
honor.
and
it
should
have
been
correctly
informed
as
to
his
status
under
oklahoma
law
that
he
was
a
"child"
under
the
laws
of
oklahoma.
for
all
these
reasons,
we
submit
there
is
great
risk
in
this
case
apparent
from
the
record
that
the
jury's
inquiry
into
youth,
into
non-adulthood,
was
truncated.
it
was
truncated
by
the
failure
to
answer
the
jury
more
specifically
when
they
asked
about
the
meaning
of
the
word,
"mitigating".
it
was
truncated
when
the
jury
was
told
he
was
an
adult.
it
was
truncated
when
they
were
not
told
in
specific,
particularized
ways,
that
youth
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case,
and
that
they
must
make
a
judgment
on
that
question.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
on
the
issue
of
adulthood,
no,
but
the
oklahoma
appellate
public
defender
did
raise
the
issue
that
more
particularized
guidelines
focusing
the
jury
on
the
mitigating
circumstances
was
necessary.
and,
i
might
add,
that
would
have
required
the
overruling
of
an
explicit
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
decision,
chainey
v.
state,
in
which
particularized
guidelines
are
not
allowed
under
oklahoma
law.
we
submit
that
this
process
made
it
very
clear
that
there
is
a
constitutionally
unacceptable
risk
that
non-adulthood
was
not
weighed
in
a
sensitive,
careful,
reasoned
way
in
this
particular
case.
we
also
submit
that
this
case
also
has
additional
facts
that
make
this
inappropriate
occasion
for
infliction
of
the
death
sentence.
according
to
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals,
inflammatory
photographs
of
decomposing
remains
of
the
murder
victim
were
introduced
and
used
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
closing
argument
during
the
death
sentencing
process.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
--on
the...
well,
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
record
on
that
point,
your
honor.
the
appellate
public
defender
argues
strenuously
that
it
was
erroneous
to
admit
the
photographs.
the
argument
of
the
appellate
public
defender
did
not
distinguish
between
the
sentencing
phase
and
the
guilt
phase,
but
it
was
not
focused
solely
on
the
guilt
phase.
the
appellate
public
defender
also
criticized
the
trial
prosecutor
for
his
use
of
the
photographs
in
closing
argument,
also
in
connection
with
mischaracterizing
the
defendant's
age.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
perhaps,
your
honor,
although,
i--
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
--well,
i
recognize
it
is
an
extremely
difficult
task
to
ask
this
court
to
get
into
the
business
difficult
and
unpleasant
of
what
photographs
are
too
gruesome
and
what
photographs
are
not.
here
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
found
the
photographs
to
be
"ghastly,
gruesome,
calculated
only
to
enflame
the
jury,
and
proving
virtually
nothing.
"
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
that
is
right.
i
mean,
the
photographs
depicted
the
biology
of
decomposition,
not
the
brutality
of
the
crime.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
if
the
photographs
were
probative
of
the
way
in
which
the
crime
was
committed,
probative
and
relevant
for
those
grounds,
then
i
would
think
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
case,
your
honor,
one
that
would
bear
upon
the
fundamental
justice
of
the
death
penalty
because
of
the
aggravating
circumstance
of
what
is
"cruel,
atrocious
and
heinous".
but
that
is
not
the
situation
here:
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
these
photographs
"proved
virtually
nothing".
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
this:
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
denounced
the
introduction
of
these
photographs
in
very
strong
terms.
and
then
said
they
were
harmless
as
to
guilt
or
innocence.
it
gave
no
indication
whatsoever
that
these
photographs
could
be
admissible
during
the
sentencing
phase.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
that
is
a
fair
characterization,
your
honor.
we
submit,
however,
that
because
of
the
way
in
which
the
oklahoma...
excuse
me,
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals,
described
these
photographs,
facts
that
they
found
in
relation
to
the
inflammatory
nature
of
these
photographs,
the
constitutionally
unacceptable
risk
that
the
jury
was
distracted
from
its
duty,
distracted
from
the
true
assessment
of
what
is
an
appropriate...
sentence,
is
plain
and
apparent
on
the
record.
if
i
may
return
to
the
basic,
what
we
have
tried
to
describe
in
our
arguments
as
the
94
percent
of
the
jurisdictions
either
have
a
minimum
line
or
have
something
in
their
legislation
which
clearly
indicates
that
cases
involving
youthful
offenders
are
special.
they
deserve
to
be
treated
differently.
that
degree
of
consensus,
along
with
the
other
factors
surrounding
the
judgment
of
the
young
in
a
capital
sentencing
case,
make
it
particularly
appropriate
for
this
court
to
declare
now,
to
reaffirm,
that
youth
bears
on
the
fundamental
justice
of
the
death
penalty.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
your
honor,
what
percentage
is
that?
sixty
percent
of
the
jurisdictions
encompassing
70
percent
of
the
population
with
an
absolute
line--
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
--that
is
true.
the
percentage
is
half.
although
i
must
suggest
that
when
we
are
considering
the
nature
of
the
death
penalty
in
considering
the
judgment
of
the
young,
to
throw
out
those
states
that
have
decided
the
death
penalty
process
is
uncertain
enough,
or
illogical
enough,
or
perhaps
too
cruel,
out
of
the
calculation
of
what
are
evolving
standards
of
decency,
is
to
not
inquire
into
what
the
consensus
really
is.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
well,
let
me
shift
then
to
trying
to
suggest
that
this
court
has
used
international
opinion
and
international
law
in
order
to
assess
what
are
evolving
society's
standards
of
decency.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
i
am
not
certain
about
that,
your
honor.
and
i
am
not
attempting
to
challenge
or
restrict
the
death
penalty
here
at
all.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
80
nations
reject
this
kind
of
executions,
and
40
of
those
nations
retain
the
death
penalty.
if
you
add
to
that
the
practice
of
the
nations
in
terms
of
the
rarity
of
these
kinds
of
executions,
the
clear
statements
that
appear
in
the
international
covenant
of
human
rights,
and
the
american
convention
of
human
rights,
it
becomes
very
clear
that
there
is
an
objective
rejection
of
execution
of
children,
and
wayne
thompson
was
a
child
under
the
laws
of
oklahoma.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
i
am
unaware
of
a
federal
death
penalty
that
goes
to
the
question.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
yes,
i
guess
i
am
unaware
of
the
answer
to
your
question.
i
did
not
think
that
there
was
authorization
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
for
a
death
sentence
of
juveniles.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
i
do
not
know
that
there
is.
the
reasons
for
this
great
consensus...
and
i
must
suggest
strenuously
it
is
a
very
strong
consensus,
really
reflect
the
fact
that
it
is
so
terribly
difficult
to
make
judgments
about
anybody
at
this
tender
age.
as
i
suggested
before,
there
is
an
inexperience
factor
here.
there
is
also
the
sense
in
which
these
people
at
this
age
have
not
been
in
command
of
their
own
lives.
they
have
not
taken
responsibility
for
establishing
a
place
in
the
community
separate
from
family,
from
friends,
and
from
parents.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
generally
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
make
a
judgment
about
a
child
or
adolescent.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
prosecuted
for
offenses
carrying
the
death
penalty?
um...
i
believe
not,
your
honor.
we
do
have
in
our
brief
the
fact
that
those
who
receive
the
death
penalty
in
proportion
to
the
number
who
are
arrested
for
criminal
homicide
are
much,
much
smaller...
something
like
0.06
percent,
as
opposed
to
1.8
percent.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
percentages?
no.
there
were
approximately
32
individuals
on
death
row.
and
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
as
to
basically
defining
the
charges,
i
do
not
have
that
information
defining
the
charges.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
that
is
an
extremely
difficult
statistic
to
come
up
with.
the
best
we
have
in
our
brief
is
the
difference
in
proportion,
the
differential
proportion
based
upon
arrests
for
criminal
homicide,
and
of
course,
that
presents
a
problem
about
which
arrests
for
criminal
homicide
are
in
fact
capital
offenses.
with
respect
to
the
uncertainty
of
the
judgment,
i
would
like
to
draw
attention
to
the
brief,
the
amicus
brief
for
the
american
society
for
adolescent
psychiatry,
which
eloquently
summarizes
the
evidence
that
what
is
happening
with
respect
to
the
juvenile
death
sentence
is
not
a
situation
where
these
individuals
are
being
sentenced
based
upon
a
judgment
that
they
have
a
maturity
beyond
their
years;
they
are
being
sentenced
to
death
despite
their
evident
immaturity
and
retarded
development.
the
fact
is
that
the
american
psychiatric
association,
when
it
discusses
the
diagnosis
of
"antisocial
personality",
states
very
clearly
that
such
a
diagnosis
should
not
be
made
until
someone
has
had
the
time,
the
experience,
to
show
the
full
longitudinal
pattern.
it
is
only
then
when
an
individual
is
in
a
sense
ready
for
the
kind
of
judgment.
the
fact
is
that
these
individuals,
this
class
of
juveniles
and
adolescents,
share
characteristics
universally
regarded
as
mitigating,
as
deserving
less
punishment,
or
at
least
a
more
generous
judgment
in
the
final
analysis.
they
share
characteristics
which
make
that
they
should
be
held
responsible
to
the
superlative
degree
of
"cruel
and
unusual".
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
tradition
yields
a
principle
of
"decent
restraint".
decent
restraint,
that
the
judgment
and
the
punishment
of
them
should
be
more
careful
and
sensitive.
the
only
way
to
ensure
that
this
tradition
is
vindicated
is
through
a
rule
that
leaves
no
latitude
for
evasion,
a
minimum
chronological
age.
but
short
of
that,
short
of
that
we
suggest
that
when
a
state
seeks
to
kill
a
human
being
for
the
crimes
of
childhood
or
adolescence,
it
must
show
at
a
minimum
that
it
made
a
reasoned,
careful
judgment
based
upon
the
reality
of
non-adulthood,
without
the
influence
of
emotion
or
prejudice.
for
these
reasons
we
pray
that
this
court
vacate
the
sentence
of
death
in
this
case
and
remand
to
oklahoma.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
thank
you.
first,
if
i
may
focus
on
the
deterrent
question:
we
are
talking
about
a
risk
of
a
death
sentence
that
is
already
extremely
low.
we
are
also
talking
about
a
situation
in
which
we
have
got
individuals
who
are
impulsive,
who
are
not
necessarily
calculating,
sophisticated
individuals.
to
believe
in
the
deterrent
effect
when
the
risk
is
so
small
even
with
the
sophisticated
and
the
calculating
is
difficult
enough,
but
the
individuals
of
the
nature
who
are
being
sentenced
to
death--
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
what
i
meant
to
say.
what
i
meant
to
say
is
they
are
part
of
a
class
who
share
characteristics
of
immaturity
and
they
are
particularly
vulnerable
to
those
personality
characteristics.
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
even
for
the
sophisticated
individual,
the
risk
is
not
great.
the
deterrent
effect
even
for
them
may
be
extremely
minimal.
for
these
individuals
who
are
the
ones
receiving
the
death
sentence,
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
believe
that
deterrence
plays
any
meaningful
role
in
the
kinds
of
thought
processes
that
led
to
these
crimes.
certification
has
been
discussed
and
perhaps
my
answers
were
garbled
before,
so
i
wanted
to
focus
on
that:
we
do
not
challenge
the
certification
of
wayne
thompson
before
this
court.
the
certification
process
is
designed
to
assess
the
capacity
for
rehabilitation
within
the
oklahoma
system,
and
it
refers
as
much
to
the
oklahoma
system
as
it
does
to
the
individual.
but
more
to
the
point,
it
does
not
focus
on
the
question
of
moral
culpability
for
purposes
of
the
death
penalty.
it
is
designed
to
avoid
a
prospect
that
i
think
everyone
in
this
room
would
find
very
difficult
to
accept,
the
prospect
of
a
manifestly
unfair
short
incarceration
period
for
a
serious
offense.
if
wayne
thompson
had
not
been
certified
to
stand
trial
as
if
he
were
an
adult,
he
would
have
been
under
the
rehabilitation
system
for
something
less
than
three
years,
a
plainly
short
time.
the
question
of
certification,
as
decided
by
the
oklahoma
trial
courts,
does
not
go
to
the
question
of
the
justice
of
the
death
penalty.
and
it
does
not
negate
the
need
for
some
clear
focus
by
the
sentencing
authority
on
the
propriety
of
the
death
sentencing
process.
it
does
not
even
depend
on
the
question
of
maturity.
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
to
my
understanding
it
is
18,
your
honor.
eighteen
of
36
retain
the
possibility
of
executing
someone
below
the
age
of
16.
seventeen
of
those
are
by
express
statute.
one
of
those--
mr.
harry
f.
tepker,
jr.
--that
is
right.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
the
question
of
rehabilitation
has
been
raised.
we
do
suggest
that
it
is
appropriate
for
the
jury
to
make
a
judgment
about
rehabilitation.
with
respect
to
wayne
thompson,
i
would
point
out
that
the
jury
was
asked
by
the
prosecutor
to
find
if
this
individual
would
commit
acts
of
violence
in
the
future.
and
they
refused
to
so-find.
that
is
a
clear
indication
that
this
question
of
rehabilitation
was
not
brought
home
to
them
as
being
of
a
primary
importance
or
focus
or
purposes
of
assessing
the
death
sentence.
moreover,
the
state's
description
of
the
rehabilitation
efforts
of
wayne
thompson,
while
accurate
to
a
degree,
are
somewhat
exaggerated:
despite
the
seriousness
of
previous
incidents
involving
law
enforcement,
wayne
thompson
was
never
institutionalized.
he
was
referred
to
a
private
church
home
for
something
like
a
month.
he
did
receive
some
counselling
both
at
school
and
elsewhere.
but
there
was
never
any
effort,
despite
the
seriousness
of
these
offenses,
to
institutionalize
him
in
the
juvenile
justice
system.
given
that
fact,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
rehabilitative
potential
of
wayne
thompson
is
up
in
the
air.
it
is
uncertain,
and
not
at
all
clear
that
the
jury
did
not
make
the
right
decision
when
it
refused
to
find
a
propensity
for
future
violence...
in
the
future.
one
last
point:
counsel
for
the
state
has
conceded
that
there
is
a
bottom
somewhere.
i
suggest
that
if
one
is
going
to
make
a
careful
assessment
of
where
that
bottom
is,
the
only
concept
that
is
meaningful
in
the
law
is
the
concept
of
non-adulthood,
to
draw
a
line
right
in
the
middle
of
the
class
of
non-adults;
right
in
the
middle
of
the
class
who
share
these
characteristics
of
inexperience
and
immaturity;
right
in
the
middle
of
this
class
of
individuals
who
are
so
difficult
to
judge
at
age
15
or
13
or
14...
makes
no
sense
whatever.
non-adulthood,
then,
should
be
the
concept.
the
tradition
of
criminal
jurisprudence
and
american
jurisprudence
is
that
these
non-adults
ought
to
be
treated
differently
and
judged
more
fairly.
thank
you
very
much.
