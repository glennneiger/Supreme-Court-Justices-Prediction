we
will
hear
arguments
now
in
no.
86-6169,
william
wayne
thompson
v.
oklahoma.
mr.
tepker,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
tepker,
are
there
some
states
other
than
oklahoma
in
which
a
minor
below
the
age
of
16
could
be
sentenced
to
death?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is,
60
percent
of
the
jurisdictions
which
provide
for
capital
punishment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
half
of
them
do
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
jury
should
have
been
instructed
that
youth
is
a
mitigating
factor
and
you
should
take
it
into
consideration
in
your
deliberations?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
there
is
any
constitutional
difficulty,
mr.
tepker,
in
introducing
a
photograph
that
shows
the
brutality
of
a
killing
if
in
fact
the
killing
was
brutal?
i
mean,
if
there
was
six
or
eight
wounds
on
the
body,
do
you
think
there
is
some
reason
why
that
photograph
simply
showing
those
wounds
could
not
be
introduced?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
source
of
your
reservation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
how...
if
the
prosecutor
had
some
other
photographs
that
did
not
show
the
decomposition,
but
showed
the
brutality,
that
would
be
one
thing.
but
my
impression
is
here
there
were
not.
there
was
no
choice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tepker.
we
will
now
hear
from
you,
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
1985
congress
insisted
that
the
states
raise
the
drinking
age,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
mr.
tepker,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tepker.
the
case
is
submitted.
