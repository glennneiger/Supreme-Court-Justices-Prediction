justice
jr.
do
you
have
any
statistics
which
could
tell
us
how
many
juveniles
have
been
prosecuted
for
offenses
carrying
the
death
penalty?
justice
jr.
but
we
do
not
know
actually
how
many
under
age
18,
for
example,
of
those
now
on
death
row,
were
prosecuted
for
offenses
carrying
the
death
penalty
when
they
were...
committed
under
18?
you
do
not
have
that?
justice
jr.
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is
how
many
have
been
prosecuted
for
offenses
carrying
the
death
penalty
and
how
many
of
those
prosecuted
in
fact
were
given
the
death
penalty?
justice
jr.
mr.
lee,
may
i
ask
you,
when
you
conceded
that
the
execution
of
a
ten-year-old
for
murder
would
be
unconstitutional,
are
you
resting
that
on
a
violation
of
the
"cruel
and
unusual
punishment"
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
eighth
amendment
that
would
suggest
such
an
exception,
is
there?
justice
jr.
you
say,
mr.
lee,
that
there
had
been
four
or
six
in
recent
years
that
received
a
death
penalty
under
fifteen?
justice
jr.
who
were
sentenced
to
death?
justice
jr.
how
many
of
those
were
carried
out?
justice
jr.
but
none
has
been
carried
out?
justice
jr.
any
significance
to
that,
do
you
think?
justice
jr.
mr.
lee,
how
many
federal
offenses
carry
the
death
penalty?
