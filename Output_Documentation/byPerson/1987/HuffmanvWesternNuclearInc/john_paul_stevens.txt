mr.
merrill,
in
opposing
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
is
that
the
position
the
government
took
that
that's
what
viability
meant?
justice
stevens
what
my
question
really
was
directed
to
was
what
position
the
government
took
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
did
they
espouse
a
particular
theory
of
viability
at
that
time?
justice
stevens
i'm
still
not
quite
sure
i've
got
an
answer
to
my
question.
let
me
phrase
it
this
way,
if
i
may:
i
take
it
there
would
be
a
distinction
between
saying
that
even
if
we
impose
restrictions,
that
will
not
make
the
industry
viable.
that
might
be
one
position
you'd
take.
a
second
position
might
be
that
even
if
we
impose
restrictions,
that
will
not
help
the
industry
even
in
the
slightest.
do
you
understand?
justice
stevens
which
if
either
of
those
two
positions
did
you
take
in
the
trial
court?
justice
stevens
i'm
talking
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
stevens
so
you're
saying
that
even
if
the
restrictions
might
tend
to
improve
the
condition
of
the
industry,
they
still
would
not
be
imposed
unless
they
would
have
the
ultimate
benefit
of
making
a
non-viable
industry
viable?
justice
stevens
may
i
go
back
historically
in
the
period
before
say
in
1979,
is
it
generally
understood
the
industry
was
viable?
justice
stevens
well,
if
it
was
viable
then,
and
your
test
of
viability
doesn't
depend
on
profits
but
rather
on
capacity,
what
happened
to
decrease
the
capacity
of
the
industry
to
serve
the
possible
national
needs
in
the
event
that
we
had
to
shut
off
imports?
justice
stevens
so
it
was
a
financial
problem
rather
than
a
physical
exhausting
mines
or
anything
of
that
kind.
justice
stevens
what
it
means
is,
if
and
i'm
not
suggesting
they
should
but
if
the
government
were
willing
to
subsidize
production
costs
or
something,
there's
no
suggestion
that
there
isn't
the
physical
capacity
to
make
the
industry
viable
in
the
sense
of
being
able
then
to
supply
them.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
like
congress
just
wanted
to
duck
responsibility.
that
doesn't
sound
like
it
helps
you
or
it
helps
the
other
side,
to
me.
how
does
that
help
you?
what
are
the
july
24,
'86
criteria.
justice
stevens
in
the
rulemaking.
justice
stevens
it
seems
they
won't
take
a
position
one
way
or
another
whether
they're
right
or
wrong.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure,
let's
focus
on
the
statutory
language
for
a
minute.
to
the
extent
necessary
to
assure
the
maintenance
of
a
viable
domestic
uranium
industry,
that's
what
they
have
to
do.
now,
is
it
your
view
that
we
do
not
even
have
to
have
any
fact
finding
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
imposition
of
restrictions
would
result
in
a
viable
industry?
justice
stevens
but
then
how
do
you
get
around
the
language
that
the
purpose
of
the
restriction
is
to
create
or
maintain...
they
use
the
word,
maintain...
to
create
what
does
not
now
exist.
everybody
agrees
there's
not
now
a
viable
domestic
industry.
but
if
it
were
perfectly
clear
that
the
imposition
of
restrictions
would
not
result
in
the
creation
of
a
viable
industry,
then
how
do
you
come
within
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
--no,
but
you
still
haven't
dealt
with
the
problem
i
presented
to
you.
what
if
we
assume,
because
there's
no
finding
to
the
contrary,
that
restrictions
would
not
result
in
viability.
justice
stevens
but
the
statute
just
says,
i
don't
see
how
you
get
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
you
have
agreed
with
their
definition
of
viability.
you're
not
assuring
the
maintenance
of
a
viable
industry
if
you
put
some
restrictions
in
place
that
will
not
achieve
that
goal.
i
don't
understand
your
argument,
is
what
i'm
saying.
maybe
you're
saying
they
have
to
do
this
and
subsidize
the
industry
in
addition,
but
surely
this
statute
doesn't
say
that.
you
know,
provide
them
with
money
and
personnel
and
things
like
that.
justice
stevens
well,
you
may
be
dead
right
that
they
shouldn't
have
taken
off
the
restrictions,
but
that's
past
history
now.
we
have
a
problem
of
what
they
must
do,
given
the
present
factual
situation
that
everybody
seems
to
agree
on.
justice
stevens
necessary
to
do
what?
justice
stevens
necessary
to
assure
an
unattainable
goal.
justice
stevens
which
you
agree
is
the
correct
definition
of
viability.
justice
stevens
i
must
say,
i
think
you
read
the
words,
to
the
extent
necessary,
etcetera,
out
of
the
statute.
you
just
say
the
commission
shall
not
offer
services.
