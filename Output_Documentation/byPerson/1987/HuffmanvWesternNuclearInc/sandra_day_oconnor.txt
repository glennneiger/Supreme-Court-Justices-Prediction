justice
o'connor
mr.
merrill,
on
the
meaning
of
viable
question,
it
is
a
little
hard
to
understand
how
a
domestic
industry
could
be
available
to
meet
national
needs
if
it
can't
make
any
money.
justice
o'connor
it
just
seems
to
be
necessarily
tied
in
if
the
companies
simply
can't
make
any
money
producing,
how
can
they
be
available
to
meet
national
needs?
justice
o'connor
--well,
mr.
merrill,
why
isn't
profitability
part
and
parcel
of
viability?
justice
o'connor
well,
why
wasn't
that
your
answer
to
justice
scalia?
i
mean,
you're
responding
to
his
questions
as
though
that
isn't
part
of
it
at
all.
justice
o'connor
and
where
do
we
find
it
in
the
materials
before
us.
i'm
looking
at
page
31
of
your
brief
which
seems
to--
--it's
quoted
on
page
36
of
your
brief,
in
part,
anyway.
justice
o'connor
where
are
you
reading?
