mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
an
important
question
of
statutory
interpretation
involving
the
department
of
energy's
uranium
enrichment
program.
section
161(v)
of
the
atomic
energy
act
authorizes
the
atomic
energy
commission,
now
the
department
of
energy,
to
provide
enrichment
services
for
utilities,
both
domestic
and
foreign,
that
operate
nuclear
power
plants.
that
section
goes
on
to
provide
that
doe
shall
restrict
its
enrichment
of
foreign
uranium
for
use
in
domestic
power
plants
to
the
extent
necessary
to
assure
the
maintenance
of
a
viable
domestic
uranium
industry.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
construed
this
language
to
mean
that
when
the
domestic
uranium
industry
is
not
viable,
doe
must
automatically
stop
all
enrichment
of
foreign
uranium,
even
if
this
would
not
make
the
domestic
industry
viable.
we
disagree.
in
our
view,
the
statute
instructs
doe
to
restrict
enrichment
of
foreign
uranium
only
to
the
extent
that
such
restrictions
will
in
fact
make
the
domestic
industry
viable
and
does
not
instruct
that
doe
must
impose
enrichment
restrictions
when
it
would
not
have
the
effect
of
making
the
domestic
industry
viable.
this
case
was
decided
below
on
respondent's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
key
fact
under
the
court
of
appeals
theory
is
that
the
status
of
the
domestic
uranium
industry
whether
or
not
it
is
currently
viable.
as
to
that
fact,
there
is
no
dispute.
the
secretary
of
energy
has
found
in
a
series
of
annual
viability
determinations
that
the
domestic
uranium
mining
and
milling
industry
is
not
currently
viable.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
meaning
of
viability
is
spelled
out
in
some
detail,
first
of
all,
by
congress.
congress
passed
a
statute
in
1982,
section
170(b)
of
the
atomic
energy
act,
which
sets
forth
eight
criteria
the
department
of
energy
is
to
look
at
in
making
a
viability
determination.
the
secretary
has
in
turn
issued
regulations
under
that
statute
which
further
spells
out
the
method
that
will
be
followed
in
determining
viability.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we
think
clearly
yes.
although
the
criteria
are
complex
that
the
gist
of
the
statutory
criteria
and
of
the
secretary's
regulations
are
to
focus
on
the
capability
of
the
domestic
industry
in
satisfying
the
needs
of
the
nuclear
power
industry
in
the
event
of
certain
future
contingencies
such
as
an
interruption
of
imports.
neither
the
statutory
criteria
nor
the
regulations
focus
merely
on
the
profitability
of
the
domestic
industry.
so
for
example
if
you
had
one
or
two
domestic
uranium
plants
that
were
very
profitable
but
nevertheless
did
not
have
the
capacity
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
the
domestic
industry,
that
would
not
be
a
viable
industry.
a
viable
industry
is
one
which
has
the
resources,
both
in
terms
of
reserves
production
capacity
and
financial
strength
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
the
domestic
power
industry.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
whether
it's
a
strange
use
or
not,
congress
clearly
set
forth
the
criteria
in
1982
which
were
to
be
used,
and
the
criteria
focused
on
things
like
the
production
capacity
of
the
industry
and
its
financial
resources.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
meaning
of
viability
was
never
really
confronted
in
this
case.
it
was
raised
in
count
v
of
the
respondents'
complaint
and
there
was
some
pleadings
in
the
district
court
on
the
question.
but
the
district
court
never
reached
the
issue
and
the
respondents
then
dismissed
that
count
from
their
complaint
without
prejudice.
so
there's
been
no
focus
exactly
on
what
the
meaning
of
viability
is.
the
case
was
decided
below
on
the
assumption
that
the
domestic
industry
was
not
viable.
the
department
of
energy
has
a
view
as
to
what
that
means.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
department's
theory
throughout
this
case
has
been
that
the
statute,
contrary
to
the
lower
court's,
does
not
require
restrictions
be
imposed
whenever
the
domestic
industry
is
not
viable.
the
statute
requires
an
inquiry
into
the
effects
that
restrictions
would
have
on
the
viability
of
the
domestic
industry.
so
in
our
view,
what
the
statute
requires
is
that
the
secretary
look
at
the
condition
of
the
domestic
industry
and
consider
the
effect
of
restricting
enrichment
of
foreign
uranium
on
that
condition
and
act
accordingly.
if
the
domestic
industry
is
viable
and
does
not
need
any
restriction
on
foreign
imports,
no
restrictions
are
appropriate.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
industry
is
not
viable
and
restrictions
on
imports
would
not
do
anything
to
make
it
viable,
the
statute
also
does
not
require
restrictions.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
understand.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i'm
not
sure
what
position
we've
taken
up
to
this
point.
our
position--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--our
position
has
been
throughout
that
the
statute
requires
an
examination
of
the
effects
of
restrictions
and
restrictions
must
be
such
as
are
necessary
to
insure
the
maintenance
of
a
viable
domestic
uranium
industry.
it
must
make
the
industry
viable.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes,
we
think
that's
correct.
if
the
latter
interpretation
that
you're
suggesting
were
the
appropriate
one,
we
think
the
statute
would
have
used
words
like,
promote,
the
viable
of
the
domestic
uranium
industry.
but
the
statute
uses
the
word
instead,
assure,
the
maintenance
of
a
viable
domestic
uranium
industry.
so
we
think
the
statutory
language
requires
not
just
restrictions
that
would
make
the
industry
a
little
better
off,
but
that
it
would
produce
an
industry
with
the
capability
of
serving
the
needs
of
the
domestic
nuclear
power
industry.
furthermore,
even
if
the
statute
meant
what
you're
suggesting,
that
restrictions
would
have
some
beneficial
effect,
that
would
require
reversal
of
the
judgment
in
this
particular
case,
because
the
court
of
appeals'
theory
of
the
statute
is
that
no
inquiry
into
effects
is
required
whatsoever.
once
you
find
that
the
domestic
industry
is
not
viable,
bang,
that
ends
the
matter,
and
the
department
of
energy
must
impose
one
hundred
percent
restrictions.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
four
factors
that
the
department
of
energy
looks
at
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
industry
is
viable
are
the
financial
resources
of
the
industry.
and
the
key
in
recent
years
to
finding--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--we
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
the
financial
resources
of
the
industry
are
an
integral
part
of
determining
whether
or
not
they
have
the
capability
of
serving
the
needs
of
the
domestic
industry.
but
in
order
to
be
capable
of
serving
the
needs
of
the
domestic
power
industry,
they
must
have
considerable
financial
resources
to
raise
the
capital
that's
necessary
to
build
the
production
facilities
that
will
produce
a
substantial
quantity
of
uranium.
and
it's
the
secretary's
determination
that
those
financial
resources
are
not
in
the
picture
at
this
particular
time
and
that
imposing
restrictions
on
foreign
uranium
would
not
put
those
financial
resources
into
the
picture.
in
fact,
it's
the
secretary's
view
that
such
restrictions
would
be
counterproductive.
they
would
not
in
the
long
run
help
the
domestic
uranium
industry.
but
again,
that
issue
was
not
addressed
below.
the
question
of
the
effects
one
way
or
the
other
was
not
addressed
by
the
lower
courts.
they
went
off
on
this
legal
theory
that
that
kind
of
inquiry
just
was
not
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
don't
think
that
the
issue
before
this
court
requires
the
court
to
get
into
an
analysis
of
the
secretary's
reasoning
about
the
effects
of--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
it
requires
of
course
that
the
court
consider
the
legal
reasons
that
we're
advancing
for
the
proposition
that
section
161(v)
does
not
impose
this
automatic
shutoff
whenever
the
domestic
industry
is
not
viable.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes,
in
that
case
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
in
a
proper
proceeding
under
this
statute,
as
we
interpret
it,
the
secretary
of
energy
would
examine
the
effects
of
restrictions
on
foreign
uranium
to
see
whether
or
not
they
would
produce
a
viable
domestic
industry.
once
that
determination
had
been
made,
then
some
type
of
judicial
review
proceeding
would
be
appropriate
we
think
to
examine
that
reasoning
and
that
rationale
to
see
whether
or
not
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
whether
or
not
it
comported
with
the
statute.
that's
not
the
case
that
you
have
here.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
review
any
of
the
reasoning
that
the
secretary
advanced
in
the
1986
rulemaking.
that
was
not
before
the
court.
the
lower
courts
went
off
on
a
pure
legal
theory
to
the
effect
that
section
161(v)
does
not
require
any
inquiry
into
effects.
it
simply
requires
an
automatic
imposition
whenever
the
domestic
industry
is
not
viable.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no.
this
court
in
our
view
should
simply
examine
the
legal
rationale
the
lower
court
gave
in
support
of
the
district
court's
summary
judgment
order,
and
if
the
court
finds
that
the
statute
does
mandate
an
inquiry
into
effects,
that
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
the
case
would
then
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
further
appropriate
proceedings.
we
think
that
two
things
are
critical
with
regard
to
those
further
proceedings.
one,
that
they
should
take
place
under
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
is
that
the
statute
requires
an
inquiry
into
the
effects
of
restrictions.
and
secondly
under
the
statute,
it's
the
department
of
energy's
responsibility
to
make
the
findings
about
effects.
the
district
court
is
not
to
conduct
a
trial
de
novo
into
the
conditions
of
the
uranium
industry
but
rather,
it's
the
department's
responsibility
to
make
that,
subject
of
course
to
appropriate
judicial
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
as
best
i
recollect,
the
dispute
that
was
raised
in
count
v
of
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
a
very
narrow
one.
the
respondents
argued
that
viability
means
capability
of
serving
all
the
needs
of
the
domestic
industry
and
they
criticized
the
fact
that
the
secretary,
in
his
1983
rulemaking
to
define
viability,
had
tinkered
with
that
and
had
said
that
it
only,
it
deleted
the
word,
total
needs,
and
just
said,
needs.
and
also
had
qualified
it
by
talking
about
future
contingencies,
in
the
face
of
future
contingencies.
there
is
no
basic
dispute
between
the
parties
in
this
case,
i
don't
think,
based
on
that
at
least,
that
viability
refers
to
the
question
of
what
can
the
domestic
uranium
industry
do
for
us,
rather
than
what
can
we
do
for
it.
the
statute
was
not
intended
as
a
measure
to
simply
provide
financial
relief
for
the
domestic
uranium
industry.
and
it's
quite
clear,
i
think,
from
the
original
legislative
history
that--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
that
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
restrictions
should
now
be
imposed
on
domestic
uranium.
the
only
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
the
court
of
appeal's
legal
theory
was
correct,
which
states
that
restrictions
have
to
be
imposed
now
because
the
statute
mandates
that
without
any
further
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
the
domestic
uranium
industry
and
its
relationship
to
the
world
uranium
market.
and
so
since
there's
nothing
technically
in
the
record
that
would
allow
this
court
to
review
the
secretary's
determination
of
effects,
we
think
that
that
question
properly
has
to
be
sent
back
to
be
decided
through
proper
proceedings
before
the
secretary
and
that
the
district
court
should
probably
be
the
appropriate
forum
to
decide
what
the
nature
and
form
of
those
further
proceedings
should
take.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes.
we're
asking
for
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below
and
remand
for
further
appropriate
decisions
in
light
of
that.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we
think
that
the
department
and
its
predecessor
agency,
the
atomic
energy
commission,
have
always
articulated
a
consistent
vision
of
section
161(v)
which
is
that
the
statute
requires
an
examination
of
the
effects
of
restriction
on
the
domestic
industry.
there
are
a
number
of
statements--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
in
an
appropriate
case,
if
the
department
found
that
the
domestic
industry
was
not
viable
and
that
restrictions
would
return
it
to
viability
and
assure
its
viability,
of
course
restrictions
would
be
required.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we
are
unaware
of
any
statement
that
is
inconsistent
with
what
you
just
said.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
rulemaking?
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
current
enrichment
criteria
were
reconsidered
in
1986.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
it
occurred
in
the
middle
of
the
district
court
proceedings.
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
i
think
came
down
in
january
of
1986.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
1986
rulemaking
took
a
position
which
is
completely
consistent
with
the
position
which
has
been
taken
in
this
litigation.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
1986
rulemaking
retained
in
effect
the
enrichment
criteria
which
had
been
in
effect
before.
the
current
enrichment
criteria
originate
in
1974
and
the
department
of
energy
decided
that
the
domestic
industry
was--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--that
was
by
regulation.
that
the
domestic
industry
was
on
its
feet
sufficiently
so
that
restrictions
on
foreign
uranium
could
be
phased
out.
in
1974,
the
secretary
promulgated
a
phase-out
schedule
which
started
in
1977
and
in
increments
proceeded
to
1984.
from
time
to
time,
in
the
early
1980s,
informal
inquiries
were
made
as
to
whether
or
not
some
kind
of
postponement
of
this
phase
out
or
reimposition
of
restrictions
were
appropriate.
there
were
congressional
hearings
held
in
1981
in
which
the
issue
was
aired.
throughout
this
period
of
time,
including
the
most
recent
rulemaking,
the
secretary
has
taken
the
position
that
no
modification
of
this
1974
schedule
was
appropriate.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
justice
white,
the
industry
really
suffered
a
precipitous
decline
in
the
early
1980s.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we
think
that
really
it
had
virtually
nothing
to
do
with
the
removal
of
restrictions.
in
the
early
1980s,
restrictions
were
still
in
effect
but
were
being
phased
out.
there
were
some
imports
at
that
time
but
they
were
well
below
ten
percent
of
the
total
energy
requirements
of
the
domestic
industry.
and
the
industry
collapsed
at
a
point
in
time
when
imports
were
really
a
relatively
minor
aspect
of
the
picture.
now,
since
then
imports
have
increased.
in
the
last
three
years
imports
have
been
running
at
around
the
range
of
35
to
45
percent
of
domestic
energy
needs.
but
the
secretary's
position
is
that
because
section
161(v)
applies
only
to
enrichment
of
raw
uranium
and
does
not
restrict
imports
of
enriched
uranium
and
because
there
are
now
two
european
consortia
that
actually
compete
with
doe
to
provide
enriched
uranium
that
the
imposition
of
restrictions
on
unenriched
uranium
would
simply
induce
domestic
utilities
in
large
numbers
to
flee
overseas
to
these
other
competitors
of
doe
and
purchase
enriched
uranium
for
direct
import
into
the
united
states.
so
for
that
reason
at
this
point
in
time,
even
though
imports
are
a
fairly
large
aspect
of
the
picture,
the
particular
mechanism
that
section
161(v)
establishes
would
not
provide
any
relief
to
the
industry.
another
aspect
of
the
industry
which
has
emerged
is
there's
now
an
active
secondary
market.
because
the
demand
projections
that
were
made
in
the
1970s
about
the
increased
demand
for
uranium
in
the
future
led
to
a
tremendous
production
exploration
activity
and
created
a
huge
imbalance
between
supplies
and
demand,
there
is
now
a
large
stockpile
of
surplus
enriched
uranium
that
many
utilities
own.
and
there's
an
active
secondary
market
trading
in
this
enriched
uranium.
and
that's
another
source
the
utilities
could
turn
to
if
in
fact
restrictions
were
imposed
on
the
enrichment
of
foreign
uranium.
so
those
are
the
reasons
which
the
secretary
has
given
in
the
1986
rulemaking
for
not
at
this
point
in
time
reimposing
restrictions.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
think,
yes,
your
honor.
in
1974
in
particular,
when
doe
announced
that
it
was
going
to
phase
out
restrictions,
there
were
some
congressional
hearings
held,
but
there's
nothing
that
really
reflects--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
the
initial
determination
of
non-viability
was
made
in
1985
with
respect
to
1984.
and
the
primary
rationale
there
was
that
the
industry
lacked
sufficient
financial
resources
to
have
the
production
capacity
ten
years
hence
to
supply
the
domestic
nuclear
power
industry
in
the
event
of
something
like
an
interruption
of
imports.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
secretary
has
found
that
there
are
sufficient
economic
reserves,
and
that
for
present
needs
there
is
sufficient
production
capacity
but
the
concern
is
that
because
of
the
financial
weakness
of
the
industry
that
somewhere
down
the
future,
it
will
not
have
sufficient
productive
capacity
in
order
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
the
domestic
industry.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
physical
capacity
in
the
sense
of
reserves
or?
i
think
there
are
more
than
adequate
reserves.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
will
be
in
the
future
production
capacity,
mines,
milling
equipment
and
things
like
this
is
the
basic
reason
for
the
non-viability
finding
at
this
point
in
time.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
justice
scalia,
i
think
congress
when
it
enacted
section
161(v)
was
basically
concerned
about
two
things.
they
were
concerned
about
the
possible
weakness
of
the
domestic
industry
in
the
transitional
period
from
a
totally
controlled
market
where
the
government
was
the
sole
purchaser
to
an
open
market
where
private
property
rights
existed
in
uranium
and
there
was
free
buying
and
selling.
and
they
wanted
to
cushion
the
impact
of
that
transition.
and
they
were
also
concerned
that
no
one
really
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
in
the
next
five
to
ten
years
and
therefore
that
it
was
important
to
have
a
flexible
standard
that
would
be
able
to
accommodate
different
things
that
might
have
happened.
and
the
net
result
was
that
they
enacted
the
particular
statute
which
has
purposeful
language
that
adopts
a
means
end
relationship
and
says
that
we
have
a
goal.
the
goal
is
a
viable
domestic
industry.
we
have
a
tool,
enrichment
restrictions.
and
we
want
you
to
use
this
tool
when
it
will
assure
the
maintenance
of
a
viable
domestic
industry.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
i
don't
know,
a
hundred
percent,
95
percent.
the
concept
of
viability
is
not
keyed
to
particular
percentages
like
that.
it's
a
judgmental
concept
which
again
focuses
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
industry
will
be
able
to
overcome
certain
types
of
future
contingencies.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
a
conclusion
that
the
industry
could
serve
95
percent
of
the
industry
as
opposed
to
a
hundred
percent--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
congress
in
1964
thought
that
this
tool
would
do
the
job.
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
that.
but
congress
did
not
enact
that
particular
understanding
into
law.
congress
adopted
a
purposeful
standard.
that
purposeful
standard
as
applied
today
we
think
can
only
dictate
one
result
which
is
that
the
secretary
has
to
look
at
the
effects
and
under
that
type
of
an
examination--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--it
is,
justice
o'connor,
financial
resources.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
it
is
part
of
the
inquiry,
absolutely.
the
secretary
looks
to
see
whether
or
not
there
are
sufficient
financial
resources
to
render
a
viable
industry.
what
the
secretary
does
not
do,
however,
and
i
think
this
was
the
thrust
of
your
question,
is
say,
would
restrictions
help
a
little
bit.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
all
i
can
say,
justice
scalia,
is--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--is
that
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
a
good
deal
of
the
discussion
here
is
focused
on
questions
like
what
is
the
proper
definition
of
viability
and
will
the
restrictions
work
or
won't
they
work,
and
whether
the
1986
criteria
were
proper
or
improper.
none
of
those
questions
are
really
before
the
court.
the
only
question
before
the
court
is
the
court
of
appeals'
statutory
interpretation
which
said
that
you
don't
have
to
look
to
the
effects,
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
to
the
status
of
the
industry
and
if
it's
not
viable,
you
must
impose
one
hundred
percent
restrictions.
if
that
is
an
erroneous
reading
of
the
statute,
the
court
should
so
determine,
and
that's
really
the
end
of
the
matter
before
the
court.
i
think
for
that
reason,
the
discussion
about
the
1986
continuing
resolution
is
also
quite
irrelevant.
all
that
resolution
says
on
its
face
is
that
nothing
in
the
resolution
or
in
the
1986
criteria
are
to
affect
the
position
of
the
parties
in
this
litigation.
and
as
i've
just
indicated,
the
criteria
are
not
at
issue
in
this
litigation.
they
were
not
something
that
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on,
and
clearly
we
don't
rely
on
the
resolution
in
any
way
in
this
case.
and
so
that's
just
a
large--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--the
department
has
a
mandatory--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--your
question,
i
take
it
is,
even
if
we
have
no
duty
to
impose,
do
we
still
have
the
authority
to
impose?
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that
i
think
is
a
close
question.
i
don't
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
needs
to
be
reached
here.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no.
the
opposition
suggests
that
we
have
a
mandatory
duty
to
impose
restrictions
when
the
domestic
industry
is
not
viable
whether
or
not
that
would
have
any
effect
whatsoever
on
the
restoration
of
the
viability
of
the
industry.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
said
it
was
a
close
question.
we
think
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
no.
we
think
that
congress
spoke
to
this
issue
in
1964.
it
provided
a
specific
tool
and
that
that
tool
is
to
be
used
only
in
one
circumstance
when
necessary
to
assure
the
viability,
and
not
otherwise.
