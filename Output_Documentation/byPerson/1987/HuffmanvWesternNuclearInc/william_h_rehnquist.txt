87-645,
f.
clark
huffman
v.
western
nuclear,
inc.--
mr.
merrill,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
merrill.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
nickles.
chief
justice
rehnquist
precisely
what
is
the
statutory
provision
that
was
enacted
in
1986?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
mean
the
legislative
history
of
the
conference
report
but
exactly
what
was
enacted
into
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
was
interested
in
the
precise
language
that
was
enacted
into
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now
you're
reading
from
page
2?
chief
justice
rehnquist
2a.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
would
have
some
doubt
as
to
whether
congress
had
spoken
very
clearly
in
a
continuing
resolution
appropriating
money,
we
ought
to
defer
to
that
speaking
when
it's
talking
about
a
particular
case.
but
if
there's
doubt
about
it,
i
mean,
this
is
not
an
ordinary
form
of
enacting
a
substantive
law.
it's
an
appropriations
bill.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
congress
says
in
an
appropriations
resolution,
we
want
the
supreme
court
to
affirm
the
tenth
circuit
in
a
particular
case?
what
weight
should
we
give
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you're
like
congress.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
why
did
they
give
the
agency
any
discretion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say,
necessary,
it
means
necessary
in
aid
of
some
end.
you
just
use
necessary
as
if
it
were
a
word
hanging
out
there.
necessary
to
do
what?
to
achieve
a
hundred
percent,
quote,
viability.
everybody
agrees
these
restrictions
wouldn't
do
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
is
a
hundred
percent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
what
is
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
thought
a
minute
ago
you
said
that
even
though
the
subsidies
would
accomplish
not
even
raising
it
from
27
percent
to
28
percent,
they
still
would
have
to
be
allotted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
would
there
be
any
hearing
as
to
whether
the
subsidies
ought
to
be
imposed?
i
mean,
it
would
just
be
automatic
i
think
in
your
view.
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
subsidies
are
automatic.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nickles.
mr.
merrill,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
merrill.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

opinions
of
the
court

two
cases,
no.

dahl,

no.
87-645,
huffman
