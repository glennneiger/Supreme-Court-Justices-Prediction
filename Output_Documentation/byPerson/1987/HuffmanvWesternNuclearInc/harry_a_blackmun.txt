we'll
take
up
the
latter
case
first.
a
section
of
the
atomic
energy
act
authorizes
the
department
of
energy
to
offer
its
services
for
a
fee
to
convert
natural
uranium
into
the
enriched
uranium
that
is
used
for
fuel
and
commercial
reactors.
it
provides
that
the
department
shall
restrict
its
enrichment
of
foreign
source
uranium
intended
for
use
in
domestic
facilities,
and
i
quote,
“to
the
extent
necessary
to
assure
the
maintenance
of
a
viable
domestic
uranium
industry.”
the
department
has
determined
that
the
domestic
industry
has
not
been
viable
to
use
a
statutory
word
since
1983,
and
that
the
imposition
of
restrictions
would
not
assure
viability.
in
this
case,
which
comes
to
use
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
the
respondent
domestic
uranium
company
sued
the
department
in
the
federal
court,
alleging
that
the
failure
to
impose
restrictions
was
a
violation
of
the
clear
words
of
the
statute.
they
move
for
summary
judgment,
and
the
district
court
granted
that
motion,
holding
that
the
statute
gave
the
department
no
discretion.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
judgment
in
relevant
part.
we
reverse
and
hold
that
the
statute
does
not
require
the
department
to
restrict
enrichment
of
foreign
uranium
where
the
restriction
would
not
achieve
the
statutory
goal
of
assuring
the
maintenance
of
a
viable
domestic
uranium
industry
and
that
decision
is
unanimous.
