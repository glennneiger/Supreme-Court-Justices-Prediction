justice
kennedy
so
the
reason
for
the
non-viability
determination
by
the
secretary
is
relevant
to
our
consideration
of
this
case
and
to
the
operation
of
the
statute?
justice
kennedy
not
his
reasoning,
but
his
reasons.
justice
kennedy
no.
my
point
is
suppose
the
report
said
that
the
industry
is
not
viable
because
there's
too
much
enrichment
being
given
to
foreign
materials.
i
take
it
then
the
reason
for
non-viability
would
be
critical
to
the
operation
of
this
statute?
justice
kennedy
and
so
then
it
follows
that
the
reasons
that
the
secretary
gives
for
the
non-viability
determination
should
be
consulted
in
determining
the
operation
of
the
statute.
justice
kennedy
well,
should
the
case
go
back
or
should
we
assess
the
viability
report
here
and
say
the
statute
cannot
possibly
operate.
is
that
your
view?
justice
kennedy
yes,
but
i'm
still
not
sure
if
you're
saying
the
statute
does
not
operate
here
because
of
what
was
said
in
the
report
or
because
the
ultimate
finding
of
non-viability
was
made.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
necessary
for
us
to
determine
what
we're
supposed
to
do
with
this
case,
whether
we're
supposed
to
decide
it
here
or
send
it
back
for
more
findings.
justice
kennedy
so
you're
asking
for
a
remand?
