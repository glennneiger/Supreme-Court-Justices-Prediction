justice
scalia
what
does
that
mean
in
the
context
of
that
finding?
that
it
can't
make
a
profit,
or
that
it
won't
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
all
our
domestic
needs?
justice
scalia
does
the
congressional
statute
require
that
viability
be
determined
by
ability
to
meet
national
needs,
rather
than
profitability?
justice
scalia
it's
a
strange
use
of
the
word,
i
must
say.
justice
scalia
my
problem,
mr.
merrill,
is
that
to
some
extent,
my
determination
of
what
the
statute
means
when
it
says
that
they
will
provide
it
if
necessary
to
assure
the
viability,
depends
to
some
extent
upon
what
i
think
the
statute
means
by
viability.
if
it
means
one
thing
by
viability,
it
is
more
likely
to
bear
the
meaning
you
want
it
to
bear,
and
if
it
means
another,
somewhat
less
likely.
that's
why
i
wanted
to
know
what
your
interpretation
of
what
it
means
is.
justice
scalia
mr.
merrill,
if
you
mean
by
viability
what
you
say
you
mean
by
viability,
i
find
it
very
implausible
that
congress
intended
what
you
say
it
intended.
you're
essentially
saying
that
congress
so
much
cared
about
whether
we
had
a
domestic
capacity
to
produce
this
uranium
that
it
said
we
want
you
to
continue
to
subsidize
this
domestic
industry
up
to
the
point
where
that
subsidy
is
no
longer
needed
for
that
industry
to
fullfil
one
hundred
percent
of
our
domestic
needs.
however,
if
you
find
that
that
industry
is
only
at
best
going
to
be
able
to
fullfil
90
percent
of
our
domestic
needs,
well,
then
we
don't
want
you
to
subsidize
it
at
all.
that's
an
absolutely
weird
intent.
all
or
nothing
at
all.
either
give
us
a
domestic
industry
that
can
produce
a
hundred
percent
of
everything
we
need,
or
else,
don't
give
us
any
at
all.
why
would
congress
intend
something
like
that?
now,
if
you
mean
something
different
by
viability,
if
you
mean
profitability,
that
i
could
understand.
justice
scalia
by
viable
you
mean
can
fullfil
a
hundred
percent
of
our
capacity,
and
it
is
an
accurate
description
of
your
position
to
say,
congress
wanted
this
industry
to
be
subsidized
if
it
could
fullfil
a
hundred
percent
of
our
capacity.
but
if
it
could
fullfil
only
95
percent
of
our
capacity,
congress
wanted
the
subsidy
to
be
withdrawn.
what,
out
of
spite?
why
would
congress
enact
a
statute
like
that?
justice
scalia
well,
make
it
80.
i
mean,
95
percent
isn't
it.
it's
just...
well--
justice
scalia
that's
not
my
problem.
i
think
you
would
say
if
the
subsidy
would
enable
an
industry
to
be
profitable
that
could
only
produce
80
percent
of
our
national
capacity,
then
there's
no
viability
and
no
subsidy
is
needed.
wouldn't
that
be
your
answer?
justice
scalia
is,
yes.
justice
scalia
well,
not
any
more.
this
is
no
longer
effective,
right?
it
was
just
in
an
appropriations.
it's
in
effect
for
one
year
and
then
it's
no
longer
in
effect.
so
i
assume
we
can
now
assume
that
just
the
opposite
of
this
is
true,
that
is,
that
those
criteria
now
can
affect
the
merits
of
a
legal
position.
justice
scalia
they
should
have
put
it
in
the
statute
if
they
wanted
it
to
have
that
effect.
this
is
only
in
a
one
year
appropriation.
and
once
that...
congress
knows
that...
once
that
appropriation
bill
goes
out
of
effect,
so
does
that
provision
of
law.
the
executive
branch
would
be
in
terrible
shape
if
everything
that's
ever
been
put
in
an
appropriation's
rider
continues
in
effect.
you
know
that.
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
function.
justice
scalia
could
i
ask
you
about
your
interpretation
of
viability?
as
you
gather,
i
didn't
agree
with
the
government's.
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
hard
to
understand
that.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
yours,
either.
i
gather,
do
you
think
it
means
ability
to
produce
100
percent
of
the
domestic
needs,
or
not?
or
it
just
means
economic
viability?
justice
scalia
so
you
agree
with
the
government,
then,
essentially,
as
to
what
viability
means?
justice
scalia
but
viability
is
not
in
doubt
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
well,
maybe
so,
but--
justice
scalia
actually,
if
i
understand
your
position,
i
think
i
understand
it
even
less
than
justice
stevens
does,
because
you're
not
just
saying
that
if
you
can't
make
a
hundred
percent
of
total
needs
or
80
percent,
pick
your
number,
you
still
have
to
keep
subsidizing.
you
are
also
saying
you
have
to
keep
subsidizing
even
if
it
is
fully
established
that
the
subsidy
will
not
do
any
good
at
all.
not
only
that
it
won't
bring
it
up
to
100
percent,
but
it
will
do
no
good
whatever.
isn't
that
your
position,
that
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
agency
has
no,
and
the
court
has
no
right
to
inquire
whether
it'll
bring
you
up
from
27
percent
to
28
percent,
even?
right?
justice
scalia
we've
got
a
clash
of
very
difficult
positions,
here.
