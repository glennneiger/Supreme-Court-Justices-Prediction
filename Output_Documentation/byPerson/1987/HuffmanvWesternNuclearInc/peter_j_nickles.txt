mr.
peter
j.
nickles
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
correct
as
my
brother
says
that
we
are
confronted
with
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
but
i
think
in
light
of
the
questions,
it's
important
to
understand
very
briefly
the
procedural
history.
this
view
of
the
department
which
i
think
justice
scalia
correctly
characterized
is
a
new
view.
when
in
1974,
the
atomic
energy
commission
proposed
to
phase
out
the
one
hundred
percent
restriction,
it
told
congress
that
we
will
watch
over
the
industry
and
if
there
should
be
any
doubt
as
to
its
continuing
viability,
that
is,
it's
ability
to
meet
the
nation's
civilian
and
military
needs,
we
will
step
in
and
restrict
enrichment.
we
litigated
in
the
district
court
and
the
judge
had
granted
a
summary
judgment
imposing
an
injunction
and
requiring
a
rulemaking
for
the
department
to
explain
why
it
should
not
impose
restriction
in
light
of
its
concession
as
to
non-viability.
and
it
was
only,
justice
white,
after
judge
carrigan
issued
the
injunction
that
the
department
published
its
rule.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
the
rulemaking
proceedings,
justice
white,
commenced
after
the
filing
of
the
summary
judgment
and
in
the
midst
of
the
litigation.
the
rule
was
not
complete
as
of
the
time
the
summary
judgment
was
granted.
and
the
court
can
look
in
vain
in
the
joint
appendix
for
the
findings
that
have
been
mentioned
by
my
brother.
there
are
no
such
findings
in
the
record.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
the
prior
practice,
justice
white,
is--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--not
at
all.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
in
1981,
the
department
explained
that
restrictions
would
impact
its
enrichment
enterprise.
when
congress
enacted
section
161(v),
the
atomic
energy
commission
had
a
monopoly
on
enrichment,
and
therefore
congress
knew
that
imposing
restrictions
would
have
an
impact.
in
1974,
the
department
then
had
some
competition,
and
when
the
congress
asked
the
atomic
energy
commission,
how
do
you
intend
to
assure
that
the
industry
meets
our
national
security
needs,
the
atomic
energy
commission
said,
we
have
161(v)
which
we
will
use.
we
also
have
the
power
over
import
licenses.
the
practice
had
been,
justice
white,
to
impose
one
hundred
percent
restriction.
it
was
phased
out
between
1974
and
1984.
when
the
industry
in
1981
said
to
the
department,
we
need
your
help
now.
we
are
non-viable.
the
department
said,
you
are
viable.
we
then
had
the
congress
pass
in
1982,
amendments
that
required
an
annual
determination
of
viability.
and
for
the
first
determination
made
by
the
department
in
1984,
the
department
said
in
1983,
the
industry,
although
flat
on
its
back,
is
viable.
i
think
very
much
along
the
lines
of
justice
scalia's
remarks.
finally,
in
1986,
and
in
1985,
and
in
1987,
the
department
conceded,
yes,
the
industry
now
is
not
viable
and
the
department
in
effect
stands
here
before
the
court
today
and
says,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
we
have
abandoned
the
industry,
we
no
longer
can
do
anything
for
the
industry.
this
interpretation
of
the
department
has
never
been
put
before
the
congress
of
the
united
states
before
july
of
1986.
and
what
happened
when
it
put
this
interpretation
before
the
congress?
the
congress
said
in
public
law
99-500,
that
the
court
should
pay
no
attention,
should
give
no
weight
to
this
interpretation
of
the
department
of
interior.
i
submit,
justice
white,
that
one
can
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
the
administrative
practice
from
1964
on
and
one
will
not
see
any
suggestion
of
this
departmental
interpretation
that
says
in
effect
that
we
have
the
discretion
to
decide
that
if
we
don't
believe
that
80
or
100
percent
of
the
needs
of
this
country
can
be
met
by
imposing
restrictions,
we
can
simply
throw
up
our
hands
and
do
nothing.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
white.
that
what
you
have
in
effect
is,
unlike
the
young
case,--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
don't
defer.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--don't
defer.
unlike
the
young
case,
which
is
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
government,
where
the
court
was
confronted
with
a
fifty
year
interpretation
practice
by
the
fda
which
had
in
effect
been
endorsed
by
the
congress,
the
very
first
time
the
department
of
energy
puts
this
interpretation
before
the
congress,
the
congress
says,
don't
defer.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
white.
it
was
one
of
these
continuing
resolutions
passed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
keep
the
government
going,
and
as
part
of
that,
the
congress
saw
fit
to
take
note
of
this
particular
matter.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
as
well
considered
as
most
matters.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
the
statutory
provision--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--what
was
enacted
into
law--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--it's
in
our
brief
in
opposition
and
notwithstanding
the
effectiveness
of
the
criteria,--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--this
is
in
2a
of
the
respondent's
brief
in
opposition.
in
effect,
the
congress
was
providing
funds
in
appendix
a,
so
that
this
enrichment
program
which
is
an
important
program
could
work.
and
the
congress
said
in
effect
that
funds
provided
in
the
joint
resolution
shall
be
used
to
operate
the
enrichment
program.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
right,
your
honor
but
notwithstanding--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--2a.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
down
at
the
bottom.
provided,
further,
that
no
provision
of
this
joint
resolution
or
the
july
24,
1986
criteria
shall
affect
the
merits
of
the
legal
position
of
any
of
the
parties
concerning
the
questions
whether
section
161(v)
of
the
atomic
energy
act
requires
restriction
of
enrichment
of
foreign
origin
source
material
destined
for
use
in
domestic
utilization
facilities.
that
is
the
precise
language
of
the
congress.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
these
are
the
criteria,
justice
white,
that
announce
for
the
first
time--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--in
the
rulemaking
that
the
department
will
not,
in
effect,
impose
the
requirements
of
section
161(v).
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
i
think
it
sustains
our
position
because
in
effect
when
the
department
for
the
first
time
over
this
long
history
of
the
statute
put
forward
an
interpretation
which
i
suggest
is
not
revealed
in
any
of
the
legislative
or
administrative
history,
that
congress
did
not
permit
those
criteria
to
go
into
effect.
as
the
court
knows,
161(v)
when
the
department
promulgates
criteria,
they
go
into
effect
in
forty
days.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
well,
the
reason
it's
important,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
under
161(v),
if
the
congress
had
not
taken
this
action
under
the
terms
of
section
161(v),
the
criteria
would
have
become
effective.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
such
weight
as
the
court
believes
it
deserves.
i
don't
believe--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--mr.
chief
justice,
this
court
interprets
the
law.
i
think
the
importance
of
the
provision
is
made
manifest
when
one
reveals
and
reviews
the
government's
position
deriving
from
the
young
case
where
the
government
places
heavy
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
this
case
is
governed
by
young.
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
the
congress
has
stepped
in.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
scalia.
i
think
congress
was
speaking
to
the
fact
that
this
new
interpretation
of
the
department
announced
in
july
of
1986
would
not
be
permitted
to
pass
into
effectiveness
under
the
provisions
of
161(v).
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
i
think
it
important,
it
bears
on
this
question
to
review
the
young
case
because
the
position
taken
by
the
government
i
think
is
inconsistent
with
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
young
case.
there
is
no
claimed
ambiguity
in
the
words
of
the
statute.
the
statute
uses
the
words
of
command,
the
department
shall
not
enrich
foreign
uranium.
the
qualifying
phrase
informs
the
department
of
the
percent
limitation
that
is
to
be
imposed.
the
department's
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
not
that
restrictions
are
not
needful,
is
not
that
restrictions
will
not
help
the
industry,
it
is
that
161(v)
standing
alone
will
not
achieve
this
80
or
100
percent
ability
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
nation.
now,
in
contrast,...
yes?
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
means
both,
but
most
importantly,
it
means
the
ability
of
the
domestic
uranium
industry
in
times
of
total
disruption,
that
is,
a
cut
off
of
foreign
uranium,
to
meet
the
civilian
and
military
requirements
of
this
country.
and
that's
reflected
in
the
eight
items
that
are
set
forth
in
the
1982
amendments
that
focus
time
and
again
on
the
prospects
and
the
current
data
on
imports
of
foreign
uranium
and
do
not
use
the
word,
profitability,
but
use
the
word,
financial
strength.
but
the
direction
is
on
the
ability
of
the
industry
to
meet
the
nation's
civilian
and
military
requirements
in
time
of
disruption
of
foreign--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--i
think
there's
agreement
on
that
point,
yes,
your
honor.
in
contrast
to
the
administrative
practice
in
the
young
case
where
the
food
and
drug
commissioner
had
taken
other
measures
to
protect
the
public
health
under
section
346,
so
that
the
imposition
of
tolerance
levels
were
not
necessary
for
the
protection
of
public
health,
we
have
a
situation
here
where
the
department
has
abandoned
the
industry,
taken
no
measures
that
would
assure
the
viability
of
the
industry,
but
simply
thrown
up
its
hands.
in
fact,
the
department
seeks
to
take
credit
for
the
fact
that
since
1981,
it
has
done
nothing,
contrary
to
the
representations
it
made
to
congress
in
1974
when
it
said
it
would
assure
the
viability
of
the
industry.
thirdly,
in
the
young
case,
it
was
important
to
the
court
that
this
consistent
administrative
practice
had
been
reviewed
by
congress
in
1954
and
endorsed.
i
submit
that
whatever
the
impact
of
the
continuing
resolution
that
i
brought
to
the
court's
attention,
that
this
interpretation
announced
for
the
first
time
in
july
of
1986,
has
never
received
congressional
endorsement.
the
department's
position
on
161(v)
would
render
that
statute
superfluous.
the
department
has
not
announced
any
measures,
and
it
has
a
host
of
powers
it
could
employ,
that
would
assure
the
viability
of
the
industry,
none.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
well,
i
think,
justice
white,
the
court
will
find
when
it
looks
at
the
july
1986
rule
that
there's
more
attention
paid
by
the
department
of
energy
to
free
trade,
on
non-proliferation,
on
the
status
of
its
enrichment
enterprise,
on
the
impact
of
imposing
restrictions
on
various
alleged
gatt
problems
that
the
department
had
rather
than
on
the
focus
of
the
industry.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
we
do
not
believe
it's
a
defensible
reading.
we
do
not
believe--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--we
don't
believe
it's
defensible,
your
honor.
when
congress
in
1964
enacted
this
statute,
it
made
sure
that
this
restriction
would
work,
and
as
a
result
of
the
statute,
one
hundred
percent
restrictions
were
imposed.
the
statute
does
not
say,
the
department
shall
not
enrich
foreign
uranium
if
the
department
determines
it
will
work.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
it
says
that,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
i
don't
think
they
say
that
exactly,
justice
white.
what
they
say
is,
we
are
not
saying
the
department
says
that
restrictions
are
not
needful,
that
they're
not
necessary.
what
they're
saying
in
their
papers
and
what
they
said
to
the
court
this
morning
is
that
restrictions
standing
alone,
and
we
don't
intend
to
use
any
of
those
other
powers
that
congress
gave
us,
they're
saying
restrictions
standing
alone
will
not
assure
that
80
or
100
percent
of
the
nation's
needs.
that
is
not
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute,
either
literally
or
substantively.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
that
is
our
position.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
first
of
all,
justice
stevens,
i
don't
believe
the
department
contends
that
the
restrictions
are
not
necessary.
but
we
believe
that
congress
made
the
finding
in
1964
and
has
reiterated
that
position
that
when
viability
is
in
doubt,--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--well,
the
department
should
have
imposed
these
restrictions
some
years
ago.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
there
is
non-viability,
and
as
the
tenth
circuit
said,
restrictions
must
be
imposed
going
up
to
100
percent
until
the
industry
is
restored.
now,
if
the
department
wishes
to
take
other
measures,
and
it
has
other
powers
it
can
take,--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--then
it
is
our
position,
justice
stevens,
that
the
department
must
take
that
argument
to
the
congress.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
what
we're
saying
is
that
congress
assumed
in
1964
that
these
restrictions
would
work.
in
1974,--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--justice
stevens,
congress
equipped
the
department
with
the
powers
that
could
assure
the
viability
of
the
industry.
it
has
many
powers
but
congress
said
this
is
one
that
must
be
used.
the
extent
to
which
it
must
be
used
may
very
well
depend
upon
the
other
powers
you
exercise.
but
there
is
no
question
on
this
record
that
the
department
believes
that
these
restrictions
are
necessary.
the
quarrel
between
the
parties--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--necessary
to
assure
the
viability
of
the
industry.
what
the
department
says,
justice--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--well,
the
unattainable
goal
that
the
department
talks
about,
justice
stevens,
is
this
100
percent
meeting
of
the
civilian
and
military
needs
of
the
country.
and
this
is
the--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--absolutely.
but
our
position
is
that
the
congress
was
not
giving
the
agency
a
power
that
would
not
work.
and
if
the
agency
today
believes
it
will
not
work,
it
should
go
back
to
the
congress
and
say,
because
this
will
not
work
standing
alone,
and
because
we
are
unwilling
to
impose
other
restrictions
that
may
antagonize
our
trading
partners,
and
because
of
non-proliferation,
because
of
a
lot
of
things,
please
change
the
statute.
they
have
not
done
that,
and
on
this
record
and
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history,
these
restrictions
must
be
imposed
if
congress
doesn't
change
the
words.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
i
believe
so,
justice
scalia.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
it
is
our
reading
of
the
statute
that
congress
has
made
the
determination
that
these
restrictions
are
necessary
and
that
they
must
be
imposed.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
they
gave
the
discretion
to
the
agency
to
determine
what
limitations
should
be
imposed.
and
the
district
court,
your
honor,
in
imposing
an
injunction,
told
the
agency
to
come
forward
with
a
rulemaking
to
show
the
court
why
one
hundred
percent
restrictions
would
not
be
necessary.
what
other
measures
the
department
might
take--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--the
objective
is
obviously
the
viability
of
the
industry.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
i
don't
believe
it's
a
hundred
percent.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
there's
no
fixed
percentage
on
it
under
the
department's
determination
but
it
is
enough
so
that
if
there
were
to
be
a
disruption
in
the
imports
of
foreign
uranium,
this
nation
could
be
assured
that
the
domestic
industry
was
viable
enough
to
meet
the
nation's
needs.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
in
our
view,
congress
made
the
determination
that
these
subsidies
would
work
to
assure
the
viability
of
the
industry,
and
that
other
powers--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--in
our
view,
your
honor,
when
the
department
concedes
non-viability
based
on
the
criteria
that
are
set
forth
in
the
1982
amendments--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--that
triggers
the
requirement
to
impose
restrictions.
thank
you.
