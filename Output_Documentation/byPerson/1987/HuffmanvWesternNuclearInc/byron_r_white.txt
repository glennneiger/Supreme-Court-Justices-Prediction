justice
white
has
the
department's
view
of
the
necessity
or
propriety
of
restrictions,
has
that
view
always
been
held
by
the
department,
or
did
it
at
one
time
have
a
different
view?
justice
white
well,
that
isn't
really
my
real
question,
is
it.
i
probably
haven't
put
it
very
well.
suppose
there's
a
finding
or
i'll
put
it
this
way:
even
if
there's
a
finding,
if
there
is
a
finding
of
non-viability,
then
is
restrictions
even
proper?
the
department
says,
no,
it
is
not.
they
should
not
have
any
restrictions.
is
that
right?
justice
white
all
right,
all
right.
but
has
the
department
always
said
no
restrictions
if
the
industry's
non-viable
and
restrictions
would
not
make
it
viable?
justice
white
and
when
did
the
rulemaking
take
place
in
this
case?
justice
white
the
current
regulations.
justice
white
was
that
after
the
district
court
action?
justice
white
well,
did
the
rule
when
it
was
made
merely
reflect
what
the
practice
had
been
before?
justice
white
well,
that
isn't
did
it
just
reflect
what
the
prior
practice
was,
or
not?
justice
white
was
that
by
a
rule
or?
justice
white
well,
as
they
phased
out
the
restrictions,
the
industry
went
downhill.
justice
white
partly
caused
by
the
removal
of
restrictions
or?
justice
white
well,
they
had
undertaken
to
make
it.
the
rulemaking
proceedings
had
been
going
on?
justice
white
yes,
but
how
about
the
prior
practice?
justice
white
i
would
suppose
that
the
department
said
to
the
congress,
we'll
watch
over
the
industry,
we'll
impose
restrictions
if
it
is
going
down
the
tubes.
but
at
some
point,
they
must
have
refused
requests
for
restrictions.
and
i
suppose
the
reason
they
gave
was
that
it
wouldn't
do
any
good.
justice
white
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
know
about.
justice
white
what
do
you
think
the
legal
affect
of
what
congress
did
is?
do
not
give
any
weight
to
it.
it
didn't
purport
to
revoke
the
rule.
it
just
said,
just
don't
pay
any
attention
to
the
department's
construction
of
the
statute.
you
go
back
and
just
construe
the
statute
without
regard
to
the
doe's
views?
justice
white
is
there
some
legislative
history
about
that
statute
or--
justice
white
--well
considered.
justice
white
well,
you
say
we
shouldn't
defer
to
their
judgment
at
all
in
this
case.
you
say
it's
new
and
all
it
does
is
reflect
some
vague
policy
about
free
trade.
justice
white
well,
maybe,
but
are
you
submitting
here
that
the
language
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
restrictions
just
can't
be
read
as
the
department
does?
is
their
reading
a
defensible
reading?
justice
white
i
know
you
think
there's
another
better
one,
but
do
you
think
it's
even
defensible?
justice
white
well,
but
it
does
say
that
you
are
to
impose
those
restrictions
which
are
necessary
to
assure
the
viability
of
the
domestic
industry.
is
that
what
it
says?
justice
white
and
the
department
sits
down
and
says,
well,
there's
no
number
of
restrictions,
we
can't
think
of
any
restrictions
that
would
assure
the
viability
of
the
domestic
industry,
and
so
we
can't
think
of
any
that
would
even
be
necessary.
there's
just
none
that
would
work.
justice
white
would
you
say
that
the
department
could
have
decided
to
impose
a
hundred
percent
restrictions
even
though
the
industry
was
not
viable?
would
that
have
been
contrary
to
the
statute?
justice
white
because
if
it
is,
if
it
isn't
contrary
to
the
statute,
then
the
language
of
the
statute
just
doesn't
compel
your
result.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
if
it's
only
close,
i
take
it
you
think
that
arguably
the
language
of
the
statute
could
be
read
as
your
opposition
suggests.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
the
department
could
impose
the
restrictions
even
though
the
industry
is
not
viable,
you're
saying
they
could
impose
the
restrictions
even
though
they
would
do
no
good
whatsoever,
even
though
they
would
not
restore
viability.
