mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
both
clauses
of
a
district
of
columbia
statute
initially
enacted
by
congress
in
1938.
after
stating
the
case
we
propose
to
divide
our
argument
into
three
parts.
first,
we
contend
that
the
first
clause
of
the
statute,
which
prohibits
the
display
of
specified
flags
and
banners,
violates
the
free
speech
guarantee
of
the
first
amendment.
second,
we
contend
that
the
second
clause
of
the
statute,
which
gives
the
police
the
power
to
disperse
congregations
within
these
500-foot
zones,
violates
the
first
and
fifth
amendments.
our
third
and
narrowest,
contention
is
that
both
clauses
violate
equal
protection,
because
the
legislature
has
allowed
parties
to
labor
disputes
to
utter
precisely
the
same
speech
and
precisely
the
same
conduct
that
petitioners
cannot.
the
facts
are
simple
and
relatively
straightforward:
petitioners
are
three
young
political
activists.
each
wishes
to
display
signs
containing
messages
critical
of
foreign
governments
and
their
policies
and
views
on
the
public
streets
and
sidewalks
of
the
district
of
columbia
within
500
feet
of
the
official
government
buildings
they
wish
to
criticize.
for
example,
some
of
the
petitioners
who
wish
to
display
a
pro-sakharov,
or
a
pro-solidarity
sign
on
sakharov
plaza
in
front
of
the
soviet
embassy.
one
petitioner
wishes
to
display
the
american
flag
there.
another
wishes
to
display
a
"stop
the
killing"
sign
in
front
of
the
nicaraguan
embassy.
each
petitioner
also
wishes
to
congregate
with
two
or
more
other
people
within
the
500-foot
zones,
and
each
petitioner
is
prohibited
from
either
displaying
signs
or
flags
or
congregating
by
section
1115
of
the
d.c.
code.
there
are
numerous
cases
pending
in
the
district
of
columbia
courts
involving
prosecutions
under
both
clauses
of
this
statute
for
displays
of
signs
and
congregations
at
the
soviet
and
nicaraguan
embassies.
this
is
a
1983
suit
that
was
instituted
in
the
district
courts
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief;
the
district
court
on
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment,
upheld
both
clauses
of
the
statute
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
the
court
of
appeals
in
1973
in
the
zaimi
case
interpreted
the
first
clause
of
the
statute
to
apply
only
when
there
is
a
"display",
of
a
flag
or
banner
that
produces
one
or
more
of
the
enumerated
consequences
specified
later
on
in
the
first
clause.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals,
perhaps
narrowing
that
definition
further,
construed
the
first
clause
to
apply
only
to
demonstrations
in
which
signs
are
displayed
designed
to
bring
foreign
governments
into
public
disrepute
or
public
odium.
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
neither
respondents
nor
the
federal
government
challenge
that
construction.
in
other
words,
under
the
first
clause,
the
only
thing
that
is
proscribed
is
the
display
of
a
flag
or
banner
or
a
sign
designed
or
adapted
to
bring
a
foreign
government
into
disrepute.
we
note
at
the
outset
that
under
this
construction
of
the
first
clause,
no
violence
is
proscribed:
it
is
not
illegal
for
petitioners
to
demonstrate
or
for
anybody
else
to
demonstrate;
it
is
not
illegal
under
the
first
clause
for
anybody
to
engage
in
any
violent
conduct.
there
is
a
reference,
and
maybe
several
implications
in
the
brief
of
the
respondents
and
the
united
states'
suggesting
that
the
first
clause
serves
an
interest
in
protecting
a
security
of
foreign
persons
and
property.
the
court
of
appeals
itself
acknowledged
that,
in
fact,
the
security
interests
asserted
by
the
government
in
the
court
below
was
insufficient
to
justify
the
first
clause;
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
only
conceivable
interest
that
would
sustain
the
validity
of
the
first
clause
over
a
first
amendment
challenge
was
the
governmental
interest
in
protecting
the
dignity
of
foreign
persons
and
properties...
excuse
me.
the
essential
holding
of
the
court
below
was
that
a
dignity
interest
on
the
part
of
foreign
governments
and
foreign
persons...
and
by
dignity
interest,
i
mean
"an
interest
in
avoiding
peaceful
political
insults.
"
was
not
only
a
legitimate
governmental
interest,
but
an
interest
sufficiently
compelling
to
override
petitioner's
claim
to
first
amendment
rights.
with
respect
to
the
second
clause,
the
court
of
appeals
narrowed
its
terms:
the
second
clause
on
its
face
gives
the
police
the
power
to
disperse
any
congregation
within
the
500
foot
zones
and
sets
no
limits
whatsoever
upon
that
dispersal
power.
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
dispersal
power
as
"limited
to
those
circumstances
in
which
the
police
reasonably
believed
a
threat
to
the
security
or
peace
of
an
embassy
is
present.
"
and
held
that,
"so-limited,
the
second
clause
suffers
from
no
constitutional
infirmities.
"
in
our
view,
the
first
clause
violates
the
first
amendment
for
several
separate
and
independent
reasons.
we
note
at
the
outset
that
what
is
involved
here
is
political
speech
on
traditional
public
forums;
petitioners
wish
to
speak
out
on
interests...
on
issues,
involving
foreign
relations
which
are
of
the
utmost
public
concern;
they
wish
to
do
so
at
the
seat
of
government,
and
therefore,
in
our
view,
this
case
involves
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
in
their
most
highly
protected
form.
our
first
contention
in
this
regard
is
that
the
first
clause
violates
the
first
amendment
because
it
is
viewpoint-discriminatory.
the
first
clause
does
not
prohibit
any
and
all
displays
of
signs
and
does
not
prohibit
any
and
all
displays
designed
to
communicate
ideas.
the
only
displays
prescribed
by
the
first
clause
are
those
which
are
"designed
to
bring
a
foreign
government
or
its
acts
or
officers
or
views,
into
public
odium
or
public
disrepute.
"
in
short,
petitioner
brooker
can
stand
in
front
of
the
soviet
embassy
and
wave
the
soviet
flag:
she
cannot
wave
the
american
flag.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
well,
if
i
can
take
the
first
part
first,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
statute
does
proscribe
an
acceptable
and
an
unacceptable
point
of
view:
if
someone
stands
in
front
of
any
embassy
with
a
message
designed
to
disagree
with
the
acts
or
policies
of
a
foreign
government,
that
is
proscribed.
of
course,
the
proscription
depends
in
part
on
a
policeman's
judgment
as
to
what
is
designed
to
criticize
a
government
and
what
is
not.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
the
united
states'
governmental
point
of
view
mandated
by
congress,
is
that
views
critical
of
foreign
governments
are
illegal,
but
views
supportive
of
foreign
governments
are
not.
that
"governmental
view"
is
embodied
in
the
first
clause.
as
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
someone
could
stand
in
front
of
the
nicaraguan
embassy
and
hold
up
a
sign
saying,
"we
support
daniel
ortega".
but
if
one
word
is
changed
on
the
sign,
and
the
message
is,
"we
oppose
daniel
ortega
and
we
oppose
the
contras.
"
that
is
then
proscribed
and
it
becomes
a
criminal
offense.
so
in
our
view,
the
statute
is
viewpoint-discriminatory
in
a
very
specific
sense.
in
some
cases
the
court
has
indicated
that
mere
"content-based
laws":
as
i
understand
that
term
it
means
that
a...
proscription
of
speech
on
all
subjects
except
religion,
for
example,
or
all
subjects
except
foreign
affairs...
a
content-based
distinction
is,
if
not
a
per-se
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
one
that
raises
serious
constitutional
questions
and
requires
a
compelling
governmental
interest
in
order
to
be
sustained.
in
this
case
we
have
a
narrow
proscription:
this
statute
does
not
prohibit
all
speech...
it
does
not
prohibit
speech
only
on
the
subject
of
foreign
affairs;
it
in
fact
singles
out
particular
points
of
views.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
that
is
true.
the
statute
applies
within
the
500-foot
zones.
i
do
not
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
it
applies
only
in
front
of
these
buildings.
it
applies
only
in
front
of
these
buildings;
the
statute
applies
for
a
radius
of
almost
two
football
fields
around
every
foreign
building
in
the
district
of
columbia.
it
is
also
true
that
the
statute
is
irrational
in
other
ways:
there
is
no
proscription
against
speaking...
individuals--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--not
at
all:
no.
i
make
that
argument
only
because
it
buttresses
our
"vagueness"
contention,
and
also
shows
in
our
view
that
the
statute
is
arbitrary
in
terms
of
the
way
it
is
both
enforced
and
written.
no.
we
do
not
contend
that
a
statute
that
prohibits
more
speech
could
be
better
than
this
one.
we
could--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--that
is
not
our
position.
our
position
is
that,
by
discriminating
between
viewpoints,
this
statute
essentially
legitimatizes
censorship:
that
is
the
position...
now.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
then
the
statute
would
not
be
vulnerable
on
a...
the
basis
of
a
viewpoint-discrimination
or
censorship
attack,
but
the
statute
would,
in
our
view,
be
invalid
because
of
its
overbreadth.
if
the
statute
said,
and
even
as
it
is
written,
the
statute
does
say,
"there
shall
be
no
criticism
of
foreign
governments.
"
at
least
on
picket
signs,
"anywhere
within
500
feet
of
the
official
buildings
of
those
foreign
governments.
"
that
statute
as-written,
prohibits
any
kind
of
speech
anywhere
within
what
amounts
to
insult-free
zones
that
cover
a
substantial
portion
of
northwest
washington
d.c.
in
this
connection.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
each
zone
covers
a
different
insult
free
government,
correct.
but
the
effect
of
that
kind
of
an
application
of
the
statute
is
to
insulate
foreign
governments
from
insults
against
them
throughout
a
substantial
part
of
northwest
washington.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
what
you
say
is
absolutely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
except
that
in
the
view
of
these
petitioners
and
many
others
who
depend
upon
effective
picketing
to
convey
their
views,
if
picketing
is
going
to
be
effective,
it
has
to
be
carried
out
somewhere
where
the
message
conveyed
has
some
meaning.
if
people
stand
2.5
football
fields
from
the
russian
embassy
and
are
in
front
of
a
faceless
office
building
and
hold
up
a
sign
criticizing
the
soviet
union,
the
effectiveness
of
that
message
is
substantially
diminished
and
the
likelihood
that--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--absolutely
not.
no.
our
contention
in
connection
with
an
overbreadth
argument
is
narrow:
it
is
that
(a)
this
statute
prohibits
only
expression
and
no
conduct;
that
is,
it
prohibits
what
is
most
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
does
not
prohibit
what
the
government
has
the
most
legitimate
interest
in
outlawing,
and
secondly--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--this
statute
does
not
prohibit
violence
in
any
way.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
yes,
and
that
is
the
question--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--no,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
that
is
exactly
our
point:
our
point
is,
there
are
other
statutes
that
prohibit
violence
and
untoward
conduct.
and
the
government's
interest
in
prohibiting
that
is
fully
satisfied
by
those
other
statutes.
this
statute
prohibits
only
speech
in
the
first
clause,
and
unless
the
prohibition
of
speech
is
a
governmental
interest,
there
is
no
reason
why
this
statute
should
remain
on
the
books.
i
would
like
to
go
one
step
further
and
briefly
mention
our
additional
contention
that
the
statute
is
overly
vague:
the
only
criticism
that
is
prohibited
by
the
very
words
of
the
statute
is
that
which
is
designed
to
bring
a
foreign
government
into
public
odium
or
public
disrepute.
does
that
prohibit
only
the
severest
criticism
or
mild
criticism
of
any
kind?
stated
differently,
does
this
statute
prohibit
only
that
kind
of
vigorous,
robust,
wide-open
criticism
that
has
been
constitutionally
protected,
at
least
since
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
or
does
it
prohibit
even
the
most
mild-mannered,
gently-conveyed,
political
difference
of
opinion
that
has
been
constitutionally
protected
since
day
one?
the
answer
according
to
respondents
is,
"it
prohibits
all
criticism".
well,
that
in
our
view
serves
to
accomplish
two
results:
first
it
dramatizes
again
the
sweeping
overbreadth
of
the
scope
of
the
first
clause.
secondly,
it
makes
this
statute
vulnerable
because
as
applied
by
these
respondents,
it
is
being
enforced
arbitrarily
and
discriminatorily.
the
record
it
not
only--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--yet,
the
issue...
it
is
encompassed
within
the
issues
in
our
view,
your
honor.
we
made
that
point
in
the
petition.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
the
court
of
appeals
noted
this
in
a
footnote.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
yes.
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
the
district
of
columbia
government
and
the
respondents
are
letting
thousands
of
people
violate
the
statute
at
the
south
african
embassy
with
impunity.
but
on
the
other
hand
are
prosecuting
everybody
that
demonstrates
at
the
soviet
or
nicaraguan
embassies,
is
relevant
in
two
respects:
first,
it
shows
that
the
potential
for
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement
of
the
laws,
which
is
an
important
consideration
in
any
vagueness
context,
is
not
a
theoretical
one,
but
an
active
fact.
secondly,
in
the
"equal
protection"
context,
to
the
extent
the
government
argues
that
what
is
at
stake
here
is
a
compelling
governmental
interest
of
great
constitutional
magnitude,
it
is
relevant
in
that
regard.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
does
it
violate
the
first
amendment,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
first
question?
does
it
challenge
the
statute
on
"vagueness"
grounds?
and
the
court--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--yes,
as
we
read
kolender
and
many
of
the
other
"vagueness"
cases,
the
primary
concern
in
the
"vagueness"
context
is
the
potential
for
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement.
in
our
view
here
we
not
only
have
the
potential
for
that,
but
the
reality
of
it.
but
also,
just
from
a
legal
standpoint,
in
the
"equal
protection"
context,
the
government's
answer
to
our
argument
essentially
is
that
the
insult-free
interest
is
one
of
great
constitutional
magnitude,
a
paramount
value
in
our
constitutional
scheme,
and
in
response
to
that,
it
is
relevant
for
us
to
point
out
that
the
record
belies
that
assertion.
if
this
interest
is
as
paramount
as
the
government
contends,
then
how
can
it
be
that
at
the
one
place
in
the
city
of
washington,
where
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
exposure
and
where
our
activities
are
more
visible
to
the
world
at-large
than
any
place
else,
at
the
south
african
embassy,
they
have
let
everybody
violate
the
statute
and
get
away
with
it.
that
certainly
is
relevant
to
whether
the
asserted
compelling
nature
of
this
interest
is
in
fact
as
important
as
the
government
suggests
or
whether
the
record
belies
that
assertion.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
grounds
upon
which
the
government
attempts
to
defend
the
first
clause:
the
first
interest
asserted
is
the
"dignity
interest".
as
we
understand
the
government's
position,
there
is
no
dispute
that
this
clause
cannot
be
sustained
as
a
reasonable
or
valid
time,
place
or
matter
restriction
because
it
is
content-based
and
therefore,
by
definition,
not
a
valid
time,
place
or
matter
restriction.
the
government's
position
is
that
the
first
clause
serves
to
further
a
compelling
governmental
interest
and
is
narrowly
tailored
to
accomplish
that
end.
the
compelling
interest
is
the
so-called
"dignity
interest".
again,
the
"dignity
interest"
asserted
by
the
government
is
not
an
interest
in
the
context
of
speech
or
the
style
of
expression;
it
is
not
the
difference
between
speaking
through
a
loudspeaker
system
and
conveying
messages
in
a
more
delicate
way...
the
interest
is
an
interest
in
avoiding
political
disagreements
or
political
insults.
in
our
view,
the
simplistic
view
we
take
of
this
issue,
the
argument
that
the
avoidance
of
political
insults
is
a
compelling
governmental
interest
which
can
override
first
amendment
rights,
is
a
contradiction
in
terms.
insofar
as
we
can
tell,
even
though
the
article
ii
makes
the
president
and
commander
in
chief,
it
is
clear
in
the
court's
prior
decisions
that
members
of
the
public
have
a
right
to
politically
criticize
the
president
for
his
conduct
in
office.
ever
since
bridges
v.
california
through
linmark
v.
virginia,
it
has
been
established,
as
we
read
the
cases,
that
ordinary
members
of
the
public
have
a
right
to
politically
criticize
or
otherwise
criticize
judges
and
justices
for
the
way
they
carry
out
their
duties.
as
on
the
basis
of
what
we
understand
about
the
adoption
and
gratification
of
the
first
amendment,
it
seems
difficult
to
believe
that
those
who
wrote
and
ratified
the
first
amendment
intended
to
empower
the
congress
to
enshroud
political
opponents
like
king
george
or
other
world
leaders,
in
an
envelope
that
immunizes
them
from
criticism.
there
was
no
reason
two
centuries
ago
why
foreign
leaders
around
the
world
should
be
protected
from
peaceful
free
speech
from
american
citizens,
and
if
anything,
there
is
far
less
reason
now.
as
a
practical
matter
in
today's
world--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--that
is
true,
but
that
cuts
two
ways,
mr.
justice.
in
this
connection
we
are
addressing
the
legitimacy
of
the
insult-free
interest.
if
the
insult-free
interest
is
a
legitimate
one,
for
governments
and
for
foreign
officials,
and
it
is
sufficiently
important
to
override
first
amendment
rights,
then
at
a
minimum,
it
should
be
applied
evenhandedly.
if
it
is
not
applied
evenhandedly,
if
it
is
applied
to
people
who
depend
upon
picket
signs
to
convey
their
views,
it
is
not
applied
to
others
who
own
newspapers
or
own
television
stations,
or
who
are
even
able
to
speak
orally
within
the
insult-free
zones...
yes
it
is
true
that
political
insults
are
permissible
everywhere
outside
the
zones,
but
people
have
a
right
to
be
on
the
public
streets
and
sidewalks
in
the
district
of
columbia--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--if
i
said
or
implied
that,
i
certainly
did
not
mean
to.
absolutely
not.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
could
you
ask
the
question
again,
mr.
justice?
i
am
not
sure
i
have
it.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
i
may
have
been
addressing
a
narrower
point
than
i
should
have:
the
insult-free
interest
is
not
legitimate
anywhere
inside
or
outside
the
zones--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--it
would
be
made
worse.
it
would
be
made
more
vulnerable
to
an
overbreadth
attack.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
that
is
not
the
way
we
read
this
court's
"equal
protection"
decisions
either.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
i
certainly
do
not
mean
to
convey
that
implication.
this
statute
is
bad
(a)
because
it
discriminates
between
points
of
views
or
between
speakers;
but
(b)
there
is
no
right
that
prohibits
anybody
from
speaking
on
political
subjects
at
any
times
within
these
zones
where
people
have
a
right
to
be.
and
to
speak.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
that
is
not
a...
major
point.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
i
am
saying
that
further
demonstrates
the
irrational
way
in
which
the--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--i
am
saying
that
that
is
a
fact,
not
a
major
contention,
yes.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
it
is
a
matter
on
which...
upon
which
we
rely.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
no,
sir.
no.
but
i
would
like
to
make
this
clear
in
case
i
have
not:
the
1116.
the
argument
we
make
with
respect
to
the
"viewpoint-discrimination"
is
essentially
a
first
amendment
argument,
and
that
argument
is,
"some
people,
whoever
they
may
happen
to
be,
can
go
over
to
these
zones
and
hold
up
signs
expressing
one
point
of
view.
"
"it
is
permitted.
"
"if
it
is
a
contrary
point
of
view
it
is
proscribed.
"
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
it
is
certainly
an
important
one,
but
it...
yes,
we
make
that
argument.
but--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--i
would
like
to
address
the
"equal
protection"
question
just
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
misunderstanding
about
this.
the
"equal
protection"
claim
is
based
upon
mosley
and
carey
and
relies
upon
a
later
exemption
in
the
statute.
the
"equal
protection"
claim,
qua
equal
protection,
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
legislature
has
said,
"even
within
these
zones,
anyone
who
is
a
party
to
a
labor
dispute
can
perpetrate
the
insults
or
engage
in
the
conduct
that
is
otherwise
proscribed
to
anybody
else.
"
the
"equal
protection"
argument
presupposes,
unlike
the
first
amendment
argument,
that
it
would
be
legitimate
for
the
legislature
to
enact
an
all-out
all-encompassing
ban
on
speech.
but
even
in
that
narrow
context,
if
the
legislature
allows
someone
to
enter
the
zones
and
to
utter
insults
under
mosley
and
under
carey,
everybody
else
has
to
be
allowed
in.
if
i
have
not
made
this
clear,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear:
we
are
not
conceding
in
any
way
in
a
first
amendment
contest,
that
it
is
proper
to
prohibit
anybody
from
engaging
in
political
free
speech
on
any
of
these
streets
or
sidewalks
where
the
public
has
a
right
to
be
or
which
are
traditionally
used
for
expressive
activity.
briefly,
i
would
like
to
mention,
again
in
response
to
the
50
states.
in
connection
with
that
statute,
the
congress
in
1972
imposed
a
ban
on
picketing
that
was
content-neutral.
in
1976
it
came
along
and
repealed
the
ban
because
of
its
concerns
that
prohibiting
this
speech
was
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
if
congress
has
ratified...
has
implemented
treaties
entered
into
by
the
united
states
and
concluded
that
peaceful
picketing
is
not
something
which
it
can
constitutionally
proscribe
in
any
of
the
50
states,
in
our
view
it
follows
that
the
insult-free
interest
is
no
more
legitimate
in
the
district
of
columbia.
i
would
like
to
mention
just
briefly
our
claim
with
respect
to
the
second
clause:
the
second
clause
on
its
face
i
think
even
respondents
concede,
is
overbroad.
it
gives
the
police
completely
limitless
power
to
order
dispersals
of
any
congregations
within
the
zone
at
any
time.
the
court
of
appeals
has
narrowed
the
second
clause.
in
our
view
it
should
not
have
done
so,
since
it--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--i
think
it
rewrote
it.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
yes,
mr.
justice.
but
in
the--
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
--as
i
understand
the
unique
system
we
have
here,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
state
supreme
court
for
these
purposes,
for
purposes
of
interpreting
a
law
applicable
only
in
the
district.
in
that
context,
the
only
appropriate
limiting
construction
is
one
that
is
readily
apparent
and
one
was
not
here.
but
briefly
i
would
like
to
address
the
clause
as
narrowed
by
the
court
of
appeals:
it
can
mean
one
of
two
things.
it
gives
the
police
power
to
disperse
anybody
if
they
conclude
that
a
threat
to
the
"peace"
of
the
embassy
is
present.
if
that
means
what
it
normally
means
in
a
domestic
breach
of
the
peace
context,
then
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
for
the
reasons
that
have
been
set
forth
in
cox
and
in
many
other
cases.
if
the
term,
"peace"
is
more
broadly-construed,
the
way
apparently
the
majority
interpreted
it
here
to
apply
even
to
peaceful
political
insults,
then
a
fortiori,
the
power
to
disperse
those
is
overbroad.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
no,
mr.
justice,
we
did
not.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
no,
mr.
justice.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
save
a
minute
or
so
for
rebuttal.
mr.
raymond
d.
battocchi
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
have
not
made
this
clear,
i
would
like
to.
the
vienna
convention
of
1961
is
the
only
treaty
that
is
implicated
here.
that
is
the
document
that
prescribes
the
international
obligation
to
protect
foreign
missions.
the
congress
implemented
that
treaty
in
1972
through
18
u.s.c.
112,
which
is
the
nationwide
federal
statute.
that
statute
prohibits
conduct,
but
does
not
prohibit
speech,
at
least
by
implication.
congress,
in
passing
a
nationwide
federal
statute,
has
concluded
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
allow
it
to
proscribe
speech
that
is
insulting
to
foreigners.
as
one
final
point,
the
district
of
columbia
has
a
police
line
regulation
which
was
upheld
in
the
cullinane
case.
it
allows
the
police
to
remove
people
from
areas,
to
set
up
a
police
line
to
keep
them
out
of
areas
when
they
reasonably
that
is
necessary
to
protect
persons
and
property.
that
police
line
regulation
would
remain
standing
even
if
the
second
clause
is
stricken
and
would
give
the
district
of
columbia
police
all
the
authority
they
legitimately
need
to
protect
the
persons
and
property
of
any
foreign
governments
or
forcing
officials.
