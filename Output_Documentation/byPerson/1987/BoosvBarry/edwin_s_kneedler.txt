mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
in
this
case
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
target
of
the
demonstrations
in
this
case
is
not
an
organ
of
domestic
government,
as
has
been
true
in
most
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
considered,
such
as
the
edwards
case
and
the
grace
case.
it
concerns
the
diplomatic
representatives
of
a
foreign
government
and
a
foreign
mission
in
the
seat
of
government
in
the
united
states.
and
the
function
of
a
diplomatic
mission
such
as
that
is
not
to
either
participate
in
or
to
be
the
staging
ground
for
domestic
political
disputes
or
controversies
within
the
united
states.
it
has
a
quite
distinct
function
of
carrying
on
that
country's
diplomatic
mission
with
the
united
states
government,
and
as
a
matter
of
practice,
and
as
a
matter
of
obligation
under
the
vienna
convention
on
diplomatic
relations,
those
dealings
with
the
united
states
are
to
be
carried
on
directly
with
the
united
states
government
and
the
foreign
embassy
has
an
obligation
to
remain
removed
from
the
internal
affairs
of
the
united
states.
these
considerations
set
a
diplomatic
mission
in
the
district
of
columbia
apart
from
the
domestic
political
process.
in
our
view,
that
unique
status
of
diplomatic
missions
under
the
constitution
and
under
the
first
amendment
means
that
congress
may
interpose
what
is
here
a
modest
geographical
separation
between
the
diplomatic
representative
of
a
foreign
government
and
persons
in
the
united
states
who
seek
to
demonstrate
against
the
position
of
the
foreign
government.
or,
as
senator
pittman,
the
principal
sponsor
in
1938
put
it,
"all
the
statute
seeks
to
do
is
to
protect
the
representatives
and
the
mission
from
having
criticism
of
their
government
brought
to
their
attention
right
in
their
faces.
"
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
this
statute
was
enacted
by
congress
in
1938
at
a
time
when
there
was
considerable--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
the
statute
has
not
been
repealed
or
affected.
there
was
a
proposal
in
1986
to
repeal
the
statute,
in
fact
the
senate
passed
that.
the
congress
declined
to
repeal
it.
what
congress
did
instead
was
pass
a
sense
of
the
congress'
resolution
and
asked
the
district
of
columbia
government,
the
council,
to
consider
whether
revisions
in
the
statute
might
be
appropriate.
but
the
statute
as
enacted
by
congress
remains
on
the
books
and
congress
declines
to
repeal
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
being
enforced,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
statute
is
being
enforced.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
responsibility
under
the
statute
resides
with
the
metropolitan
police
department.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
that
has
been
true
from
the
outset.
the
enforcement
of
statutes
such
as
this
has
always
been
the
responsibility
of
the
metropolitan
police
force.
there
is
no
general
federal
police
force
in
district
of
columbia.
the
metropolitan
police
force,
even
before
home
rule,
was
the
principal
entity
for
these
things.
the
secret
service
does
have
backup
responsibility.
the
secret
service
is
very
interested
in
this
statute
because
of
its
importance
in
establishing
a
security
perimeter
around
embassies.
but
the
day-to-day
enforcement,
the
arrests
under
it
are
made
by
the
police
department.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
it
still
is
a
federal
statute.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
not.
not
completely
and
not
finally.
first
of
all,
congress,
as
mr.
schwab
mentioned,
has
the
responsibility
and
the
authority
to
review
statutes
passed
by
the
district
of
columbia
government,
so
if
this
should
be
repealed
or
revised,
congress
has
the
authority
to
overturn
that.
secondly,
when
congress
sent
it
to
the
district
of
columbia
government,
it
in
no
way
disclaimed
the
important
national
interest
and
law
of
nations
underlying
it.
in
fact,
it
recognized
that
there
were
security
interests
and
said
that
they
may
have
to
be
balanced
against
other
interests.
and
thirdly,
congress
quite
specifically
said
that
the
d.c.
council
should
take
this
into
account
with
the
views
of
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
because
of
their
diplomatic
and
security
interest
in
the
matter.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
the
judgment...
what
congress
said
is,
"we
have
not
made
the
judgment
that
the
interests
that
underlay
the
statute
in
1938
are
no
longer
in
force.
"
congress
again...
had
before
it
a
proposal
to
repeal
this
statute
and
declined
to
do
it.
so
as
far
as
the
law,
as
it
now
stands,
22-1115
is
still
on
the
books
as
congress
passed
it,
and
the
executive
branch,
the
secretary
of
state,
the
secret
service,
and
the
justice
department
have
all
strongly
opposed
any
reduction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
federal
government
has
not
attempted
to
do...
what
the
united
states
does
in
new
york
is
to
cooperate
with
the
city
police
in
new
york
in
establishing
appropriate
security
perimeters
around
u.n.
missions
up
there.
but
the
district
of
columbia--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
they
have
not
tried.
but
their
alternative--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--perhaps
congress
could
enact
a
nationwide
statute.
it
so
far
has
chosen
to
concentrate
on
the
seat
of
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
one
of
the
principal
reasons.
and
also
as
the
affidavit
of
one
of
the
state
department
officials
in
the
record
says,
foreign
governments
attach
particular
importance
to
what
happens
in
the
district
of
columbia
precisely
because
it
is
the
seat
of
government
of
the
united
states.
we
have
here
not
simply
consulates
but
the
embassies
of
foreign
governments
which
are
the
symbolic
presence
of
those
governments
in
the
united
states.
and
so
any
violation
of
the
security
or
dignity
of
an
embassy
would
have
particularly
grave
consequences
as
viewed
in
another
nation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
that...
i
agree
with
justice
white.
i
would
not
say
it
is
a
narrowing,
i
would
say
that
it
is
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
against
the
background--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
and
in
this
case
we
agree
with
the
district
of
columbia
on
this
point.
they
have
a
footnote
in
their
brief
in
which
they
say
where
the
statute
involved
affects
important
federal
interests
rather
than
purely
local
interests,
that
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
does
have
that
authority.
and
22-1115
was
enacted
by
congress
to
serve
important
national
and
international
interests.
so
yes,
we
do
think
that.
and
in
any
event,
i
think
that
this
court
has
that
authority
to
attach
the
construction
that
was
given
to
the
second
clause
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
perhaps
not
in
every
application.
certainly
the
sort
of
demonstrations
that...
one
category
of
demonstrations
congress
was
responding
to
in
1938
involved
picketing
by
30
or
40
people
or
even
larger
demonstrations.
i
think
at
that
point
the
security
interests
coincide
with
the
dignity
interests.
as
the,
if
you
get
down
to
a
single
picket,
then
the
security
interest
may
be
reduced.
although,
even
so,
a
hostile
picket
at
least
carries
some
potential
beyond
an
ordinary
pedestrian.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes
i
do.
and
the
dignity--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
a
part
of
it.
the
vienna
convention
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party,
requires
party-states
to
take
appropriate
steps
to
protect
the
peace
of
a
mission
against
impairment,
and
to
protect
the
dignity
of
a
mission.
now,
"appropriate
steps"
is
something
that
depends
upon
what
is
appropriate
under
the
laws
of
that
country.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
vienna
convention
simply
is
a
culmination
or
a
codification
of
a
duty
to
protect
the
dignity
of
foreign
missions
that
antedated
it.
in
fact,
when
congress
enacted
this
statute
in
1938--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
do
not
know
that
that
would
be...
i
mean,
that
would
obviously
raise
separate
questions.
there
may
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
congress
may
well
have
that
authority.
it
would
be
quite
similar
in
this
unique
context
to
a
"fighting
words"
sort
of
statute,
which
is
what
we
analogize
this
statute
to,
words
that
are
particularly
likely
to
cause
offense,
and
"something
delivered
face-to-face",
which
is
the
phrase
that
the
court
used
in
chaplinski--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
depends...
yes.
but
again...
unpleasant
in
the
way
the
statutes
speak
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
right.
and
that
is
not
far-removed
from
the
sort
of
words
that
were
discussed
in
chaplinski
itself,
where
the
court
was
referring
to
words
that
were,
"damn
fascisti"
and
that
sort
of
thing
spoken
word-to-word,
or
face-to-face,
and
if
a
legislature
can
do
that
with
respect
to
two
citizens
on
the
street,
it
can
surely
do
that
to
prevent
offense
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
in
this
case
we
are
talking
about...
i
think
that
this
case
is
even
stronger
where
we
have
a
specific
diplomatic
undertaking
in
the
conventions
which
congress
recognized
in
1938,
not
to
protect
any
insults
in
the
newspaper
or
anywhere
else,
but
to
protect
the
premises,
and
that
the
purposes
of
this
are
related
to
the
diplomatic
immunities
that
go
back
200
years,
which
are
to
enable
citizens
to...
diplomatic
personnel
to
operate
with
independence
and
to
be
free
from
intimidation
and
coercion.
and
this
being
free
from
picketing
that
might
undermine
the
independence
of
diplomatic
personnel
is
critical
to
the
performance
of
the
diplomatic
function.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
this
statute
has
been
construed
to
reach
that,
although
there
may
be
a
breach
of
the
peace
statute
that
would
separately
reach
that.
i
would
like
to
make
several
other
points
in
closing.
i
do
not
have
this
much
time:
with
respect
to
the
reciprocity
point
that
justice
stevens
mentioned,
at
page
14
of
our
brief,
we
reproduce
a
paragraph
from
the
record
that
explains
the
importance
that
the
state
department
attaches
to
this
statute
in
urging
foreign
governments
to
establish
a
security
perimeter
around--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
in
the
form
of
statutes,
but
this
is...
the
vienna
convention
refers
to
taking
appropriate
steps,
not
to
be
appropriate
in
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
specifically
a
500
foot
buffer
zone.
as
this
passage
recites,
the
state
department
has
been
successful
in
establishing
some
security
perimeter,
some
space
in
which
demonstrations,
including
signs,
cannot
occur.
so
that
has
happened.
and
when
you
determine
what
is
appropriate
under
the
vienna
convention,
it
is
sensible
to
take
into
account
the
special
sensitivity
in
this
country
to
giving
local
police
too
much
discretion
in
deciding
how
far
away
a
demonstration
should
be
located
or
how
it
should
be
conducted.
the
court's
decision
last
term
in
houston
v.
hill
is
the
latest
example
of
a
case
where
the
court
was
concerned
about
testing
that
discretion.
this
statute,
22-1115
has
as
a
virtue
of
establishing
a
clear
rule
that
both
the
secret
service
can
work
and
respect
that
diplomatic
personnel
know
that
they
are
secure
within
that
500
foot
perimeter,
and
demonstrators
know
precisely
where
the
borderline
is
in
terms
of
what
they
can
do
and
what
they
cannot.
and
this
statute
has
been
on
the
books
for
50
years
and
has
operated
with
that
500
foot
buffer
zone
around
u.s.
embassies
in
the
united
states,
and
it
has
operated
efficiently,
and
nothing
in
this
court's
first
amendment
jurisprudence
requires
that
that
congressional
judgment
be
overturned.
there
are
other
examples
where
the
nature
of
the
forum
allows
these
sorts
of
restrictions.
the
jails
in
adderly,
cox
v.
louisiana,
with
respect
to
picketing
near
courthouses,
are
very
similar.
in
fact,
cox
rests
on
a
number
of
the
same
considerations
that
underlay
22-1115,
which
is
the
importance
in
that
case
to
protect
the
judicial
function;
in
this
case
to
protect
the
diplomatic
function,
from
both
real
and
apparent
political
pressures,
and
to
allow
it
to
function
freely
without
the
outside
interference
that
might
be
more
appropriately
be
directed
at
the
political
branches
of
the
united
states
government.
so
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
briefs,
cox
v.
louisiana
is
dispositive
of
this
case.
i
would
also
like
to
say
that,
under
this
court's
decision
in
renton,
this
is
not
a
case
that...
this
is
not
a
statute
that
should
be
viewed
as
resting
on
any
judgment
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
viewpoint
of
the
content
of
what
is
being
said.
this
is
a
statute
that
is
not
justified
on
the
content,
but
is
instead
justified
on
the
content
neutral
consequences
that
would
flow
from
the
sorts
of
demonstrations
that
the
statute
is
directed
to.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
congress
certainly
has
oversight
responsibilities
over
the
district
police.
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
claim
as
i
understand
that
petitioners
have
is
not
that
the
statute
is
not
being
enforced...
arrests
are
made
at
the
south
african
embassy.
i
think
they
are
referring...
they
are
objecting
to
whether
prosecutions
then
go
forward.
and
that
issue
is
not
in
this
case.
the
court,
the
panel,
declined
to
reach
that
question.
