each
zone
covers
a
different
insult?
right?
i
mean
it
is--
justice
scalia
only
in
their
embassies.
you
can
criticize
king
george
anywhere.
justice
scalia
there
is
no
"equal
protection"
problem
here.
i
mean,
the
"one
step
at
a
time",
approach
to
eliminating
problems
is
well-established,
right?
you
can
reach
some
of
the
evils
without
having
to
reach
all
of
the
evils,
can
you
not?
justice
scalia
so
you
are
saying,
then,
that
this
statute
would
be
better
if
it
not
only
prohibited
the
picketing
with
signs
within
the
500
yards,
but
also
speaking
or
anything
else?
that
is
a
vice
in
and
of
itself,
but
it
does
not
extend
broadly
enough
within
the
500
yards?
justice
scalia
all
right,
but
you
do
not
say,
"(c)
if
there
is
such
a
right,
you
cannot
apply
it
just
to
signs
and
not
apply
it
to
speaking?
"
you
do
not
say
(c)?
justice
scalia
see
i
thought
you
were
saying
(c),
major
or
minor,
i
do
not
care.
you
are
not
saying
(c)
at
all?
justice
scalia
so
you
are
saying
(c)?
justice
scalia
it
is
a
minor
contention?
justice
scalia
do
you
want
to
assert
(c)
or
not,
just
tell
me?
justice
scalia
but
congress
and
the
president
apparently
no
longer
have
any
interest
in
it,
is
that
right?
i
mean,
it
was
originally
a
federal
statute,
but
now
it
is
a
d.c.
statute
and
congress
seems
to
have,
with
the
approval
of
the
president,
seems
to
have
worried
about
whether
it
was
too
broad
and
instead
of
deciding
that
itself,
passed
the
buck
to
the
d.c.
government,
suggesting
that
they
re-examine
it.
justice
scalia
it
just
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
peculiar
way
for
the
federal
government
to
vindicate
an
assertedly
vital
federal
interest
to
leave
it
to
a
city
council
to
vindicate
this
enormous...
this
protection,
for
foreign
diplomats.
it
is
assertedly
so
important
that
it
warrants
the
silencing
of
speech.
have
they
delegated
this
to
any
other
city
councils
in
new
york
or
elsewhere?
justice
scalia
could
new
york
adopt
a
municipal
ordinance
like
this
and
purport
to
be
vindicating
a
federal
international
interest?
justice
scalia
but
the
federal
government
has
not
intervened
to
establish
any
procedures
there?
they
have
left
it
up
to
the
municipalities?
justice
scalia
tell
me
the
process
for
the
d.c.
council's
changing
this
law.
could
it
be
done
by
a
simple
vote
of
the
council?
would
it
have
to
be
approved
by
the
president?
does
the
president
have
any--
justice
scalia
--none
at
all?
justice
scalia
i
suppose
there
may
be
some
question
as
to
whether
he
has
to
sign
the
disapproval?
the
congressional
disapproval?
justice
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
k
confess
that
i
am
inclined
to
view
a
statute
dealing
with
this
subject
that
is
passed
by
the
congress
quite
differently
from
one
that
is
passed
say
by
the
omaha
city
council,
which
may
desire
to
protect
a
consulate
in
omaha.
i
originally
thought
that
this
was
a
federal
statute;
it
originally
was
a
federal
statute?
justice
scalia
well,
it
is,
but
when
congress
passes
i
guess
what
is
referred
to
as
a
"sense
of
the
congress
resolution",
but
which
in
effect
says
to
the
district
government,
"you
decide
what
to
do
with
this
thing.
"
it
may
well
violate
the
constitution.
is
that
an
expression
by
congress
that
it
really
is
not
calling
the
shots
with
respect
to
this
any
more?
and
leaving
it
up
to
the
district
of
columbia
government?
justice
scalia
but
that
certainly
is
an
abnegation,
at
least,
of
any
views
by
the
congress
on
the
point.
congress
is
basically
saying,
"well,
we
really
have
not
made
the
judgment
that
the
international
interests
require
this
any
more.
"
justice
scalia
district
police
do
not
enforce
the
statute.
what
does
congress
do
about
that?
justice
scalia
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
battocchi,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
