mr.
edward
e.
schwab
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
has
reached
a
constitutionally
permissible
balance
in
enacting
this
statute:
the
balance
is
between
strong
national
interests
which
support
restrictions
on
demonstrations
in
the
area
of
foreign
embassies
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
rights
of
demonstrators
who
seek
to
demonstrate
at
embassies
and
other
property
of
foreign
governments.
the
restrictions
on
speech
are
modest.
the
only
restriction
on
demonstrations
is
within
the
immediate
vicinity
of
foreign
embassies;
that
is,
within
500
feet
of
them.
the
statute
was
enacted
50
years
ago
by
congress;
it
was
enacted
because
the
state
department
and
the
metropolitan
police
department
that
existing
law
was
adequate
to
deal
with
demonstrations
that
were
then
being
conducted
near
a
number
of
embassies.
it
had
the
strong
support
of
the
state
department:
secretary
of
state
hull
requested
that
the
statute
be
enacted.
it
was
drafted
by
the
chairman
of
the
foreign
relations
committee,
and
the
statute
has
been
repeatedly
upheld
in
litigation
in
the
lower
federal
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
congress
has
delegated
this
matter
to
the
city
council
and
has
suggested
to
the
council
that
it
reexamine
the
statute,
but
the
delegation
itself
indicates
that
the
obligation
of
the
united
states
being
performed
here
in
providing
protection
into
these
embassies,
the
statute
also
indicates
that
the
council
should
seek
advice
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
secretary
of
state,
and
in
fact
has
done
that.
the
secretary
of
the
treasury's
interest
is
involved
because
the
secret
service
provides
protection
to
foreign
embassies.
so
we
do
not
believe
that
there
has
been
any
congressional
abandonment
of
national
interests
here;
and
certainly
the
executive
has
not
abandoned
this,
because
they
have
been,
the
executive,
has
been
quite
heavily
involved
in
matters
before
the
council.
representatives
from
the
state
department
and
the
department
of
justice
and
the
treasury
department
have
all
testified;
they
have
all
submitted
written
statements...
secretary
schultz
has
submitted
a
written
statement,
which
is
attached
to
the
government's
brief,
the
u.s.
brief,
in
this
case,
and
of
course,
they
strongly
support
the
statute
as
amicus
curiae
here.
so
we
do
not
feel--
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
--well,
the
principal
responsibility
for
protecting
embassies
in
new
york
city
falls
on
the
new
york
police
department.
there
is
federal
reimbursement
for
that,
but
the
new
york
city
police
department
is
the
agency
that
primarily
protects
foreign
diplomats
who
lime
in
new
york
city.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
well,
new
york
has
adopted
procedures
that
are
very
similar
to
22-1115.
we
have
discussed
them
in
our
brief.
though
those
procedures
were
upheld
in
litigation,
basically
what
is
done
near
the
russian
embassy
in
new
york,
is
that
there
is
a
bull-pen
about
120
feet
from
the
russian
embassy,
the
embassy
there
to
the
u.n.
where
they
let
a
small
number
of
demonstrators
picket
in
that
bull-pen,
and
then
any
other
demonstrations
have
to
take
place
two
or
three
blocks
away
from
the
embassy.
so
that--
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
--i
am
not
sure
of
the
extent
of
their
involvement
there.
i
do
know
that
the
current
appropriations
act
has
a
$7
million
reimbursement
to
the
city
of
new
york
for
performing
these
functions.
that
is
the
state
department
appropriations.
we
have
discussed
that
briefly
in
our
brief.
i
am
sorry
i
cannot
give
you
the
page
number,
but
it
is--
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
--yes.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
yes,
it
is
different
from
this
because
in
new
york
they
are
representatives
in
our
country,
but
they
are
primarily
to
an
international
organization,
while
in
the
district
of
columbia
the
representatives
from
foreign
nations
are
representatives
certified
to
this
government.
so
there
is
a
bit
of
a
difference
here.
and
we
believe
that
that
difference
would
support
this
statute
more
strongly.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
i
am
sorry?
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
no,
other
than
the
same
interest
that
all
citizens
have
in
this
country.
there
is
no
independent
district
of
columbia
interest
here.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
the
federal
government
did
not
enact...
i
mean
congress,
enacted
this
statute
in
1938.
last
year,
congress
considered
amending
the
statute
and
rather
than
doing
that,
it
delegated
that
authority
to
the
district
of
columbia
council.
now,
if
the
council
alters
this
law,
then
of
course,
anything
that
they
enact
has...
would
not
be
effective
until
after
a
congressional
layover
period,
and
the
congress
during
that
period
could
adopt
a
joint
resolution
to
alter
anything
the
council
does.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
no,
no.
the
secretary
of
state
has
sent
a
letter
to
the
council,
informing
the
council
that
it
believes
that
strong
national
interests
support
the
current
statute
in
that--
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
--the
secretary
of
state
is
saying,
"do
not
change
the
law".
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
i
do
not
know
of
any,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
--i
do
not
think
that...
from
what
i
understand
about
"reciprocal
treatment",
it
is
not
precise
reciprocity.
what
it
is
is
comparable
protection.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
i
am
sorry,
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
i
am
sorry,
i
cannot
answer
that
either.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
i
know
of
only...
i
think
that
there
are
some
such
objections,
yes.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
i
think
there
have
been
such
objections,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
the
process
would
be
for
the
council...
the
president
has
no
involvement.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
the
council
would
enact
a
provision,
like
any
other
council
law,
then
that
is
submitted
to
the
mayor
of
the
district
of
columbia.
the
mayor
can
either
sign
or
veto.
if
the
mayor
vetoes,
then
it
goes
back
to
the
council
and
then
they
can
override
by
i
believe
a
two-thirds
vote.
then,
if
it
is
signed
or
the
veto
is
overridden,
it
is
submitted
to
congress
and
then
there
is
a
30-day
period...
i
believe
30
legislative
days,
or
roughly
comparable
legislative
days,
in
that
the
provision
sits
before
congress,
and
congress
can
then
pass
a
joint
resolution
of
disapproval.
the
joint
resolution
would
require
presidential
signature.
so
the
only
time
the
president
would
ever
get
involved
is
where
congress
has
voted
to
disapprove
or
to
somehow
alter
an
act
of
the
council.
the
only
presidential
involvement
that
there
has
been
in
this
whole
area
is
that
the
president
signs
the
home
rule
legislation,
which
gave
the
district
government
its
limited
home
rule.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
well,
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
he
has
to
sign,
but
i
mean,
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned,
but
i
believe
the
law
has
been
changed
so
that
the
only
way
to
disapprove
is
by
joint
resolution,
and
that
joint
resolution
requires
either
a
veto
or
a
signature.
it
requires
presentment.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
yes,
the
council
has
introduced
a
bill
that
is
a
very
similar
to
18
u.s.c.
section
112.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
it
has
held
hearings
on
the
bill;
it
has
heard
testimony
from
many
interested
organizations
in
the
district;
it
has
heard
testimony
from
the
state
department;
from
the
treasury
department
and
from
the
department
of
justice.
and
it
has
received
secretary
schultz'
letter.
as
far
as
i
know,
nothing
further
has
occurred
after
the
hearings.
mr.
edward
e.
schwab
well,
the
primary
change
that
would
be
made,
i
think,
is
that
picketing
would
be
permitted.
actions
that,
of
demonstrators,
that
affect
ingress
or
egress
to
embassies
would
be
unlawful...
i
mean
that
impair
ingress
or
egress...
any
acts
of
coercion
or
intimidation
or
threatening
actions...
that
would
be
prohibited
by
the
law.
now,
my
time
is
just
about
up.
i
would
like
to
say
that
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
we
believe
it
is
very
soundly
reasoned,
and
now
you
will
hear
from
mr.
kneedler,
who
will
state
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
thank
you.
