rehnquist
mr.
battocchi,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
however,
the
government
says
that
that
is
not
a
viewpoint-discriminatory
on
any
basis
established
by
the
government.
it
is
simply
the
policy
of
the
particular
embassy
in
question.
and
i
think
also
they
stated
that
there
are
not
a
lot
of
people
standing
in
line
waiting
to
wave
an
american
flag
in
front
of
the
russian
embassy.
this
statute
addresses
things
that
actually
happened,
not
hypothetical
situations.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
enforcing
a
governmental
point
of
view
on
anyone,
not
on
the
united
states'
governmental
point
of
view
on
anyone.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
does
not
prohibit
speech
anywhere
else
in
the
district
of
columbia.
on
conn...
con
or
pro
on
these
things;
it
simply
prohibits
a
particular
kind
of
speech
in
a
very
narrow
place
right
in
front
of
a
foreign
mission.
you
can
go
anywhere
else
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
say
anything
you
want
about
the
nick...
nick...
nicaraguan
government
pro
or
con,
or
about
the
russian
government.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
the
statute
just
prohibited
a
lot
diff...
a
lot
more
speech,
would
be...
fare,
better
under
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
it
be
more
constitutional?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--that
is
not
entirely
correct.
if
you
are
talking
about
the
russian
embassy,
for
example,
they
are
insulated
within
a
500-foot
radius
of
their
own
building,
which
is
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
area
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
a
small
fraction
of
the
area
of
northwest
washington.
and
the
same
is
true
of
every
other
embassy.
it
is
just
when
you
lump
them
altogether
in
a
way
which
does
not
really
make
much
sense
constitutionally
that
you
could
come
up
with
a
sort
of
analysis
that
you
do.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
constitution
gives
them
the
right
to
have
the
most
effective
possible
situs
for
their
message?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
iranian
violence
is
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
are
there
not
other
d.c.
statutes
that
prohibit
violence?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
the
government
have
to
put
every
single
prohibition
possibly
applicable
into
the
same
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
before
us,
is
that
included
in
your
petition
for
certiorari?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
do
we
have
anything
in
the
record
that
goes
to
that,
that
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
frankly
do
not
see
which
of
your
three
certiorari
questions
presents
that
issue.
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
it
represent
the
issue
of
discriminatory
enforcement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
battocchi.
mr.
schwab,
we
will
now
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

now
we
will
hear
from
you,
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
battocchi.
the
case
is
submitted.
