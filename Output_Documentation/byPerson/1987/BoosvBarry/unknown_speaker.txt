unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
who
is
representing
the
united
states,
may
be
able
to
answer
that
question.
but
from
what
i
understand,
the
primary
concern
with
regard
to
reciprocity,
and
that
is
in
the
declaration
of
james
nolan,
who
is
chief
of
foreign...
i
believe
chief
of
foreign
missions
from
the
state
department...
what
the
state
department
wants
is
a
situation
where
we
provide
protection
at
a
substantial
level
in
this
country
to
foreign
missions
so
that
these
matters
can
be
negotiated
with
foreign
governments,
and
that
where
we
believe
that
insufficient
security
is
provided
around
our
embassies
elsewhere,
we
can...
our
representatives,
can
meet
with
representatives
with
foreign
governments
and
negotiate
improved
security,
and
that
if
we...
they...
we
cannot--
--is
it
our
foreign
policy
to
object
to
hostile
signs
in
front
of
our
embassies?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
