justice
stevens
but
do
you
really
contend
that
the
statute...
that
your
argument
would
be
cured
by
a
statute
that
prohibited
insults
in
all
media
that
are
available
to
the
audience?
justice
stevens
well,
if
you
are
not
implying
it,
why
is
the
statute
any
better
by
suggesting
that?
what
is
your
answer
to
it?
i
do
not
understand.
justice
stevens
well,
justice
scalia
asked
you
about
the
discriminatory
aspect
and
you
said,
"well,
it
is
bad
because
it
is
discriminatory.
"
"it
only
interferes
with
people
who
just
have
the
means
to
carry
a
banner
around
in
front
of
the
embassy.
"
and
your
cure
for
that
would
be,
if
your
argument
is
valid,
to
ban
it
to
everybody
who
wants
to
insult
the
ambassador.
justice
stevens
and
would
the
statute
not
be
improved
by
broadening
its
coverage?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
you
cure
that
by
saying,
"no
signs
at
all",
and
you
say
that
is
worse.
your
real
argument,
as
i
understand
you
is,
that,
"the
fact
that
the
listener
or
the
audience
does
not
like
what
you
have
to
say
is
simply
not
an
acceptable
justification
for
prohibiting
speech.
"
that
is
your
whole
argument.
justice
stevens
do
you
make
any
other
argument?
i
do
not
see
it,
if
you
do.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
when
you
refer
to
the
secretary
of
state's
letter,
he
indicates
that
it
is
terribly
important
to
"ensure
that
the
united
states
missions
abroad
receive
reciprocal
treatment.
"
are
there
any
other
foreign
governments
that
impose
a
500
foot
buffer
zone
around
our
embassies,
or
any
foreign
governments
that
prohibit
marching
in
front
of
one
of
our
embassies
with
a
hostile
sign?
justice
stevens
then
"reciprocal
treatment"
does
not
seem
to
justify
the
standard.
justice
stevens
what
is
the
buffer
zone
in
any
other
foreign
country
that
you
are
familiar
with?
maybe
it
is
not
500.
is
it
400?
justice
stevens
what
about
signs?
do
any
of
them
prohibit
anything
even
similar
to
signs,
flags,
parades?
out
in
front
of
our
embassies?
justice
stevens
unfriendly
signs?
pardon
me?
justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
ask
a
question?
the
two...
two
justifications
for
the
statute
are
for
security
on
the
one
hand
and
the
dignity
interest
on
the
other.
do
you
think
the
security
interest
by
itself
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
first
clause
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
the
other
question,
then:
do
you
think
the
dignity
interest
by
itself
would
be
sufficient
to
support
the
first
clause?
justice
stevens
that
is
because
we
do
not
want
to
insult
our
guests
when
they
are
invited
here
on
a
diplomatic
mission?
justice
stevens
is
the
convention
essential
to
justify
the
statute
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
would
it
be
constitutional
to
have
a
statute
that
said
that
"at
no
diplomatic
gathering
in
either
the
white
house
or
the
state
department,
shall
any
guest
say
anything
offensive
to
any
ambassador?
"
justice
stevens
but
is
that
not
precisely
the
same
question
that
a
person
walking
in
front
of
the
embassy
with
a
sign--
justice
stevens
--that
is
what
i
am
thinking
of,
a
face-to-face
comment
to
the
ambassador.
could
we
make
it
a
crime
to
say
something
unpleasant
to
the
ambassador
at
a
social
gathering?
justice
stevens
yes,
criticizing
his
government's
policy?
justice
stevens
so
you
agree
that
is
the
same
case
as
this
statute?
justice
stevens
have
any
done
so?
have
any
established
a
500
foot--
justice
stevens
--but
have
any
of
them
taken
either
of
the
two
appropriate
steps,
one
a
500
foot
buffer
zone,
or
two,
no
signs
in
front
of
the
embassy?
