smithfield
v.
chesapeake
bay
foundation,
inc.--
mr.
prettyman,
you
may
begin
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
fact
it's
unavoidable
doesn't
get
you
off
the
hook.
i
mean,
the
statute
doesn't
require
negligence
or
wilfulness
to
make
it
an
excedence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
isn't
the
government's
position
that
it
should
apply
something
like
rule
11
of
good
faith
belief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
prettyman.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
claiborne.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
in
footnote
8,
on
page
38(a)?
chief
justice
rehnquist
on
your
construction
of
the
statute,
what
do
you
make
of
the
purpose
of
the
sixty-day
notice
provision,
which
your
opponent
says
doesn't
make
sense
unless
it's
given
opportunity
to
abate?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
was
that
you
had
to
be
affected
by
the
particular
pollution
in
question
before
you
could
sue
as
a
citizen
and,
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
ought
to
be
the
logical
counterpart
would
be
to
allow
victims
to
bring
a
prosecution
for
crime
but
not
just
anyone
in
the
community.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
claiborne.
mr.
prettyman,
you
have
two
xx--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
prettyman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-473,
gwaltney
of
smithfield
versus
chesapeake
bay
foundation
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
