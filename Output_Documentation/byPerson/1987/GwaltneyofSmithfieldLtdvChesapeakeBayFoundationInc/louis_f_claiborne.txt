mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
may
be
useful
to
begin
by
indicating
the
degree
to
which
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
risk
of
repetition
of
the
violations
which
it
had
noticed
for
the
past.
i
simply
want
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
two
footnotes,
both
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
the
first
one
is
from
the
district
court
opinion
and
appears
on
page
38(a).
it's
footnote
8,
and
there
one
finds
the
district
court's
holding,
alternative
holding,
that
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed,
there
was
sufficient
ground
to
believe
in
good
faith
that
the
problem
had
not
been
cured.
what
is
more,
the
court
itself
indicates--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--yes,
your
honor.
the
problem
of
determining
whether
a
violation
is
continuing
is
highlighted.
well,
in
this
case,
skipping
a
bit,
with
the
history
of
violations,
its
tkn
violations,
in
the
winter
time,
gwaltney
had
just
experienced
another
winter
of
repeated
violations,
despite
the
change
it
had
implemented
in
its
waste
water
treatment
system.
at
the
time
of
trial
in
december
1984,
now
that's
six
months
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
one
of
gwaltney's
own
witnesses
expressed
doubt
as
to
whether
gwaltney
would
meet
its
tkn
violations...
limitations.
it
was
not
until
gwaltney
had
experienced
a
full
winter,
the
following
winter,
after
the
trial,
without
problems
that
it
could
make
its
motion
to
dismiss
based
on
its
present
compliance
with
a
secure
belief
that
it
was,
indeed,
in
compliance.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
here
i
refer
the
court
to
page
7(a)
of
the
appendix
and
footnote
9,
looking
at
the
second
paragraph
of
that
footnote,
and
the
second
sentence
of
that
paragraph,
the
court
of
appeals
says
"a
very
sound
argument
can
be
made
that
plaintiff's
allegation
of
continuing
violations
were
made
in
good
faith
despite
the
fact
that
gwaltney
had
not
actually
violated
the
act
since
may
15th,
1984.
"
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
those,
justice
o'connor,
those
two
statements
can
be
reconciled.
what
the
court
is
saying
is
that
at
the
time
of
filing
and
at
the
time
of
trial,
there
was
ground
to
fear
that
there
would
be
repetition
of
the
excedences,
so
called;
that
is
to
say,
violations
in
winter
time.
by
the
time
this
opinion
is
written
in
june
of
1985,
the
court,
having
experienced
a
winter
without
violations,
is
now
saying
we
don't
have
ground
to
fear
for
the
future
any
longer.
they
are
different
times
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
exactly...
justice
o'connor,
i
may
have
mis-spoken.
what
i
meant
to
indicate
was
that
the
court
found
that
in
june
of
1984,
when
the
complaint
was
filed,
and
in
december
of
1984,
when
the
trial
was
held,
there
was
still
ground
to
fear
that
the
system,
the
new
system,
would
not
handle
the
problem
during
the
winter.
when
this
opinion
is
written
and
that
is
what
the
ultimate
footnotes
are
addressing
now,
judgment
being
entered,
it
would
be
speculative
to
suppose
that...
the
winter
having
gone
by
without
incident,
it
would
be
speculative
to
suppose
that
there
would
be
problems
for
the
future.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
i,
frankly,
don't
know
whether
the
court
was
made
aware
of
the
absence
of
violations
between
december
and
june.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i'm
attempting
to
tax
the
district
judge
with--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
your
honor,--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--the
footnote
to
which
i
have
referred,
footnote
8,
very
clearly
indicates
that
not
only
in
the
court's
view,
but
in
view
of
the
expert
for
the
defendant
there
is
ground
to
fear
that
the
problem
had
not
been
solved
as
of
the
date
of
trial
in
december
1984.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
your
honor,
xx
is
only
a
preamble
to
xx
is
your
honor
has
indicated,
xx
is
perhaps
a
little
logic
in
focusing
on
the
state
of
mind
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
grounds
for
objective
belief
at
the
time
of
filing
as
opposed
to
the
time
of
judgment,
and,
yet,
my
learned
friend,
seem
to
indicate
that
he
would
condone
the
assessment
of
penalties
entirely
for
the
past
provided
that
at
the
time
of
filing
there
were
an
on-going
violation,
even
though
it
had
been
demonstrated
that
the
problem
was
cured
before
judgment
was
entered.
now,
that,
to
us,
highlights
the
reason
why
it
is
not
sensible
to
focus
on
the
notion
of
on-going
violation
at
all,
whether
at
the
time
the
suit
is
filed
or
at
the
time
when
judgment
is
entered,
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
cannot
embrace
either
the
1st
circuit's
decision
or
the
government's
brief
here,
albeit
they
might
resolve
this
case
favorably
to
us,
because
it
seems
to
us
that
the
logic
must
be
that
if
it
matters
whether
there's
an
on-going
violation,
the
time
when
that
matters
is
when
penalties
are
being
assessed,
not
when
the
suit
is
being
filed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
on
its
theory.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
grateful
to
the
chief
justice
for
having
focused
my
attention
on
that
question.
legislative
history
as
to
the
reason
why
that
sixty-day
provision
was
inserted
never
mentions
one
reason
being
to
afford
the
violator
an
opportunity
to
get
off
the
hook.
that
is
no
where
suggested
in
the
legislative
history
as
a
reason
for
the
notice.
the
reason
for
the
notice
is
to
allow
the
government,
indeed,
both
governments,
federal
and
state
governments,
to
take
this
opportunity
to
decide
whether
they
wish
to
enforce
the
act
and
thereby
preempt
the
citizen's
suit,
and
that
is--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
suppose,
justice
scalia,
that
there
are
two
reasons
for
the
notice
going
to
the
violator.
the
first
is
that
when
a
violator
or
an
alleged
violator
is
being
reported
to
the
authorities
as
such,
as
violating
the
act,
it
seems
only
fair
to
give
him
notice
of
that,
not
so
that
he
can
get
off
the
hook
for
the
past
violations,
but
perhaps
so
that
he
will
more
quickly
come
into
compliance
and
afford
himself
an
opportunity
to
be
liable
for
fewer
penalties
for
a
shorter
time.
it
does
have
that
effect
of
goading
the
violator
into
ceasing
more
quickly,
not
in
order
to
be
totally
absolved
for
the
past,
but
to
shorten
the
period
for
which
he
will
owe
penalties.
if,
indeed,
penalties
are
appropriate
and
we
do
not
maintain
that
penalties
are
always
appropriate
no
matter
how
isolated
the
violation,
no
matter
how
old
it
may
be,
no
matter
how
quickly
it
was
corrected,
those
are
matters
which
the
district
court
in
its
discretion
may
determine
at
the
penalty
phase
it
had
no
bearing
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
entertain
the
case--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--and
ever
bearing
on
the--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
would
say,
justice
o'connor,
there
may
be
a
question
about
whether
five
years
is
beyond--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
that's
not
entirely
clear.
there
is
a
suggestion
that
the
statute--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--it
so
happens
the
statute
of
limitations
would
be
applicable
as
a
five-year
one
which
is
the
only
reason
i
mentioned
it.
but
let's
say
it's
four
years
ago
and
otherwise
the
matters
are
as
your
honor
suggested,
that
is
a
case
in
which
we
would
say
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
to
entertain
the
citizen
complaint.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
let
me
say,
first,
that
the
question
of
standing
had
not
been
taken
to
this
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
may
be
that
because
the
standing
in
strict
sense
is
jurisdictional,
it's
before
this
court
in
any
event,
and
i'm
not
trying
to
avoid
the
question;
i'm
just
giving
a
preparatory
explanation.
in
our
view,
standing
in
the
citizen
complainant,
and
he
must
be
under
the
statute
not
any
citizen
but
one
who
is
aggrieved
by
the
pollution
which
occurs,
that
means,
and
as
is
true
in
this
case,
that
a
member
or
more
members
of
the
organization
must
live
on
or
near
the
affected
water
and
be
injured
by
its
pollution,
either
in
his
commercial
or
recreational
activities
there.
that
shows
that
he
has
injury
in
fact.
now,
it
is
perfectly
true
that
the
assessment
of
penalties
will
not
immediately
and
directly
redress
that
injury,
but
it
will
have
a
substantially
beneficial
effect
on
his
interest
in
that
river
in
the
following
three
ways:
first,
the
threat
of
the
imposition
of
such
penalties
is
likely
as
the
epa
policy
on
penalties
is
at
pains
to
indicate
to
deter
him
from
violating
in
the
first
place.
but
even
after
he
has
violated,
if
he
has
been
assessed
substantial
penalties,
it
is
an
assurance
that
he
will
not
return
to
his
old
ways.
even
in
circumstances
where
injunction
would
not
have
been
necessary,
the
assessment
of
penalties
against
him
does
obviously
deter
him
from
doing
it
again.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but,
thirdly,--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--your
honor,
i
think
not.
it
has
a
very
particular
effect
on
the
particular
river
and
the
particular
injury
that
this
individual
plaintiff
is
concerned
about,
and
the
third
way
in
which
it
relieves
his
concern
is
that
it
deters
not
merely
that
same
violator
but
others
on
the
same
river
or
river
system
who
would
otherwise
feel
free
to
pollute
the
river
until
enjoined.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
scalia,
there
are,
i
assume,
independent
reasons
not
related
to
standing
why
an
individual
ought
not
be
permitted
to
prosecute
criminally.
so
far
as
the
answer
on
standing,
i
suppose
the
answer
must
be
yes,
that
prosecuting
for
crimes
and
prosecuting
for
penalties
would
serve
the
interest
and
protect
the
values
in
that
river
to
the
same
degree,
but--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
i
suppose
that
justice
scalia
was
really
asking
me,
and
i
shouldn't
be
making
such
assumptions,
whether
this
same
citizen
who
lives
on
or
near
the
river
would
have
equal
standing
to
bring
a
criminal
prosecution
as
he
does
in
my
submission
to
bring
an
action
for
civil
penalties,
and
put
that
way,
my
answer
is
yes,
he's
got
equal
standing,
but
the
privilege
of
prosecution
is
one
that,
for
other
constitutional
reasons,
not
standing,
are
not
available
to
the
ordinary
citizen.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
white,
the
third
way
is
in
deterring
others--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--on
the
same
river
who
would
otherwise
feel
sanguine
about
polluting
the
river,
and
i
must
say
that
we
are
talking
here
about
the
imposition
of
civil
penalties,
not
a
marginal
peripheral
unimportant
sanction.
it
is,
as
the
epa
policy
has
made
clear,
probably
the
most
important
sanction
in
government
enforcement.
one
would
suppose
that
when
the
citizen
is
given
the
privilege
of
standing
in
for
the
government,
provided
he
has
standing
or
personal
interest
in
the
matter,
he
ought
to
have
as
much
as
possible
the
same
weapons.
now,
he
cannot
issue
administrative
orders.
he
cannot
institute
criminal
prosecutions,
but
when
it
comes
to
civil
actions,
one
would
expect
him
to
be
able
to
obtain
like
relief
and
this
relief,
the
imposition
of
penalties,
is
the
most
important
instrument
because,
otherwise,
a
polluter
has
every
incentive
to
delay
compliance
and
to
profit
by
his
advantage
over
complying
competitors
and
to
delay
the
expenditures.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they're
available
in
both
directions,
your
honor.
congress
was
well
aware
that
there
might
be
a
tendency
to
abuse
the
citizens
supervision,
so
it
provided
and
the
legislative
history
notes
it
that
attorneys'
fees
are
available
to
the
plaintiff,
but
they're
available
against
him
if
he
files
frivolous,
vexatious
or
harassing
litigation,
and
that,
of
course,
is
a
deterrent
to
the
frivolous
plaintiff
who--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--under
this
court's
holding
that
there
is
no
action
for
damages
in
federal
law,
he
would
not
be
able
to
invoke
either
the
clean
water
act
or
the
federal
common
law
in
order
to
make
himself
whole,
but
he
would
be
free
to
invoke
state
damage
remedies.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
be
state
law
to
obtain
damages.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
isn't--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--it
would
be
extraordinary
if
the
solution
to
the
standing
problem
were
to
have
a
treetom
action,
which
the
court
has
more
than
once
indicated
presents
no
constitutional
problem,
which
congress
only
last
year
reaffirmed
and
widened
with
respect
to
the
false
claims
act,
thereby
if
we
had
a
treetom
action
in
which
the
informer
had
a
pecuniary
interest
because
he
got
a
share
of
the
assessment
and,
yet,
he
would
widen
the
class
of
potential
plaintiffs
to
include
any
citizen,
as
is
true
under
the
false
claims
act,
now
that
simply
cannot
be
a
way
one
solves
a
constitutional
standing
problem
and,
yet,
it
would
seem
to
be,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
there
is
such
a
problem,
a
simple
remedy
for
congress
at
the
next
session.
now,
i
want
to...
i
am
making
a
very
disconnected
argument,
but
i
want
to
stress
that
congress
did
not
use
language
in
this
statute
with
all
the
precision
that
one
might
have
hoped
for.
there
is
loose
language.
there
is
misuse
of
language.
that
is
easily
demonstrated
by
anyone
who
reads
the
act.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
ought
to
prefer
to
tax
congress
with
loose
language,
a
lapse
of
tense
perhaps,
not
clearly
but
perhaps,
even
somewhat
illiterate
sentences
here
and
there,
rather
than
to
attribute
to
congress
a
scheme
which
is
downright
nonsense.
it
is
downright
nonsense
to
say
there
shall
be
penalties
assessable
in
citizen
suits.
as
to
that,
there
can
be
no
question.
the
statute
says
so.
it
certainly
works.
and
then
to
say
oh,
but,
that
means
only
in
those
rare
cases,
because
they
must
be
rare,
in
which
despite
having
been
notified
sixty
days
before,
the
polluter
is
so
perverse
and
so
improvident
as
to
continue
his
evil
ways
until
the
day
of
filing
or
perhaps
the
day
of
judgment,
maybe
that's
the
government's
position,
i'm
not
sure,
because
otherwise
he
is
excused
from
all
penalties
and
the
court
has
no
power
to
impose
them.
one
thing
or
the
other.
it
is
conceivable
to
hesitate
to
give
the
power
to
assess
penalties
going
to
the
treasury
for
private
payment.
one
can
understand
that,
but
once
you
do
give
a
plaintiff
that
power,
you
don't
take
it
all
back
from
him
and
make
it
available
only
in
that
rare
case
that
it
will
almost
never
occur;
that
is
the
case
where
the
polluter
is
so
perverse
and
so
improvident
as
to
continue
his
violation
long
enough
to
give
the
court
jurisdiction
to
enter
these
awards.
that
simply
cannot
have
been
the
intent
of
congress.
the...
it
was
mentioned
that
section
505(1)(b),
this
is
reproduced
in
petitioner's
brief
at
page
3,
refers
to
an
action
to
require
compliance
and
that
is
an
action
to
require
compliance
by
a
citizen
which
would
be
barred
if
the
government
had
previously
filed.
and
the
suggestion
is
that
an
action
for
penalties
is
not
an
action
to
require
compliance;
therefore,
congress
is
telling
us
here
that
it
never
intended
to
authorize
an
action
for
penalties.
now,
we
know
it
did.
so,
we're
a
bit
at
a
loss,
but
the
other
thing
to
be
noticed
about
this
provision
is
that
it
doesn't
use
language
quite
so
fastidiously.
the
words
are
that
the
federal
or
state
governments,
the
citizens
suits
will
not
lie
if
the
federal
or
state
governments
has
commenced
and
is
diligently
prosecuting
a
civil
or
criminal
action
in
a
court
of
the
united
states
to
require
compliance
with
the
standard
of
limitations
and
so
forth.
let
me
say
a
criminal
action
is
not,
strictly
speaking,
an
action
to
require
compliance
any
more
than
an
action
to
collect
penalties.
what
is
proved
here
is
simply
that
congress
was
not
punctilious
in
its
use
of
language,
not
that
it
meant
that
there
was
no
action
by
the
citizen
to
secure
an
assessment
of
penalties.
indeed,
the
congress,
in
1985-86
and
'87,
made
quite
clear
that
it
understood
itself
some
years
earlier
to
have
authorized
citizens
suits
in
respect
of
wholly
past
violations
and
to
the
assessment
of
penalties
without
an
injunction
in
those
circumstances.
i
draw
the--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--again,
justice
scalia,
i
wonder
whether
they
really
meant
it.
i
think
that
is
rather
a
lapse.
we
do
not
claim
that
right.
the
section
309(d)
was
added
in
1987.
it
had
been
prepared
in
1985
and
1986,
the
provision,
for
quite
independent
reasons,
was
vetoed
by
the
president,
and,
so,
was
not
enacted
in
its
final
form
until
1987.
its
purpose,
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
was
to
add
to
the
clean
water
act
an
ability
for
the
administrator
to
assess
penalties
administratively.
he
had
already
issued
cease
and
desist
orders
administratively,
but
he
could
not
assess
penalties
in
this
way.
having
given
the
administrator
that
authority
and
we
are
clear
on
both
sides
that
this
authority
relates
solely
to
past
events,
solely
to
past
violations,
which
attract
the
civil
penalties,
congress
went
on
to
say
that
a
citizens
suit
would
lie
in
respect
of
the
same
violations
only
if
notified
or
filed
before
the
administrator
acted.
now,
according
to
the
petitioner,
that
was
unnecessary
to
say
because
there
could
be
no
citizen
suit
notified
or
filed
in
respect
to
purely
past
violations.
here
is
congress
indicating
that
it
understood
otherwise.
i
may
say
that
the
petitioner
himself
obviously
understood
otherwise
during
the
eleven
months
before
the
filing
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
this
ground
and
when
it
took
the
trouble
to
seek
amendment
of
the
summary
judgment
that
had
been
entered
in
august
1984,
to
absolve
itself
in
respect
of
the
violations
that
had
occurred
before
it
acquired
the
property,
what
was
the
point
of
that,
except
that
it
feared
that
penalties
would
be
assessed
in
respect
of
those
old
violations.
it
was
only
eleven
months
later
that,
and
only
when
the
5th
circuit
handed
down
its
hamford
decision
that
anybody
for
the
first
time
focused
on
the
present
tense
in
505
and
said,
oh,
this
qualifies,
the
entire
statute,
we
had
it
wrong,
no
penalties
can
be
assessed
in
a
citizen
suit,
except
only,
when
for
reasons
not
easy
to
understand,
when
they
are,
in
effect,
combined
with
an
injunction.
the
one
time
you
don't
need
penalties
because
the
injunction
serves
the
purpose
and
its
violation
will,
of
course,
attract
civil
and
criminal
contempt
penalties
of
its
own.
for
these
reasons,
we
pledge
affirmance
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
