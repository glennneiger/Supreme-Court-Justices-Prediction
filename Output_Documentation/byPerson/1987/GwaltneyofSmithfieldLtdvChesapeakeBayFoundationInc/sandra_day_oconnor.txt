justice
o'connor
mr.
prettyman,
did
the
district
court
have
an
alternative
holding
below
that
there
were
continuing
violations?
justice
o'connor
i
was
under
the
impression
that
it
did,
and
that
that
holding
was
just
not
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
o'connor
so,
even
if
you
were
right,
what,
at
best,
what
would
happen?
it
would
be
vacated
and
remanded
so
that
that
could
be
considered?
justice
o'connor
well,
unless
the
trier
of
fact
thought
that
there
was,
indeed,
a
likelihood
of
some
continuing
problem,
for
example,
with
the
tkn-type
discharge.
justice
o'connor
mr.
prettyman,
can
the
epa
administrator
bring
a
civil
penalty
action
for
purely
past
violations?
justice
o'connor
the
language
is
the
same.
justice
o'connor
the
government
relies
on
statutes
outside
because
of
the
similarity
of
the
language
perhaps.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
prettyman,
what's
the
test
for
violation
and
to
get
into
court
in
this
citizens
suit?
you
don't
really
take
the
position,
as
i
read
your
brief,
that
there
has
to
be
a
violation
on
the
day
the
suit
is
filed.
justice
o'connor
and
if
there's
any
question
about
the
efficacy
of
the
so-called
correction,
is
that
something
that
would
xx
the
citizen
to
sue
and
litigate
about?
justice
o'connor
so,
possibly,
the
plaintiffs
below
had
at
least
that
much
of
a
complaint
with
regard
to
the
tkn
problem.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
claiborne,
what
about
the
footnotes
25
and
26
that
mr.
prettyman
referred
to
in
the
district
court
opinion,
which
basically
say
the
district
court
believes
that
to
conclude
there
were
continuing
violations
would
be
too
speculative
on
the
present
record?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
the
district
court
opinion
reflects
the
situation
as
of
the
conclusion
of
the
trial?
justice
o'connor
and
that
these
footnotes
indicate
that
the
court
found
that
too
speculative
to
find
an
on-going
violation
at
that
time?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
claiborne,--
justice
o'connor
--i'm
troubled
by
suppose
we
have
a
situation
of
two
or
three
isolated
violations,
five
years
before
the
suit
is
filed,
and
the
citizen
files
the
suit
seeking
only
civil
penalties
for
those
prior
violations.
now,
you
want
us
to
hold
that
that
kind
of
a
suit
is
perfectly
permitted
and
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
there's
no
statute
of
limitations.
justice
o'connor
well,
let's
not
go
off
on
that.
let's
assume
there
is
none.
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
the
penalties
go
only
to
the
government,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
and
how
does
the
citizen
have
standing
in
a
constitutional
sense
to
come
in
and
get
those?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
know,
but
doesn't
that
form
an
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
seems
to
me--
justice
o'connor
--that
really
is
stretching
any
traditional
notice
of
standing.
