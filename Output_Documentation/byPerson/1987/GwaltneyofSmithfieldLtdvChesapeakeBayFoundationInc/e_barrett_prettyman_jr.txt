mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
4th
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
it
involves
the
question
of
whether
citizens
can
sue
for
purely
past
violations
as
opposed
to
ongoing
violations
under
the
clean
water
act.
congress
has
set
up
a
rather
interesting
dual
system
of
regulating
effluent
discharges
into
the
nation's
waterways.
the
states
adopt
these
plans,
which
are
approved
by
the
administrator
of
epa,
the
states
issue
permits,
which
set
forth
the
effluent
limitations
and
standards
under
which
the
permit
holders
can
discharge,
and
then
to
demonstrate
that
he
is
operating
within
the
ambits
of
his
permit,
the
discharger
is
required
to
constantly
test
the
effluents
and
to
fill
out
dmrs
or
discharge
monitoring
reports
which
are
on
public
file
and
which
anyone
can
go
see.
these
dmrs
show
on
their
face
when
the
permit
holder
is
operating
within
the
parameters
of
the
permit
and
they
also
show
on
their
face
if,
in
fact,
the
discharger
is
exceeding
those
limits.
thus,
citizens
groups
like
respondent
can
review
these
dmrs
on
the
public
record
and
then
give
sixty
day
notice
if
they're
going
to
sue
for
alleged
violations
and
if
the
suits
are
not
settled,
then
you...
they
can
collect
$10,
000
a
day,
which
has
now
been
upped
to
$25,000
a
day,
except
when
i
say
collect,
i
really
mean
that
that
money,
of
course,
goes
to
the
united
states
and
not
to
them.
they
allege
in
their
allegations
the
permit
holder
to
be
in
violation.
they
usually
attach
these
dmrs
to
their
complaints
and
as
i
say,
in
theory
at
least,
the
recovery
goes
to
the
united
states.
when
gwaltney
of
smithfield
purchased
a
meat
rendering
and
packing
plant
from
itt
toward
the
end
of
1981,
it
found
after
the
purchase
that
it
had
inherited
some
problems,
principally
with
the
biological
treatment
system.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
they
did
have
knowledge
that
itt
had
had
problems.
they
thought
the
problems
had
been
solved.
they
found
after
they
purchased
that
the
problems
had
not
been
solved.
these
problems
involved
primarily
chlorine,
fecal
coliform,
and
total
kjeldahl
nitrogen
or
tkn,
and
it
thereafter
experienced
various
excedences
and
various
parameters
of
its
permits.
however,
it
then
installed
two
new
systems
and
it's
undisputed
that
all
of
the
excedences
had,
in
fact,
stopped
prior
to
this
suit.
the
court
of
appeals
so
held.
it
was
so
stipulated
between
the
parties
and
the
respondents
even
conceded
in
their
question
presented
before
this
court
that
this
case
involved
only
past
violations.
first,
as
to
chlorine,
i'll
touch
on
these
just
briefly,
as
to
chlorine,
we
have
found
many
problems
in
installing
a
new
automatic
chlorinator,
but
that
finally
fell
into
place
in
october
of
'82,
so
that
there
were
no
excedences
for
some
twenty
months
or
almost
two
years
prior
to
the
trial
in
this
matter.
with
the
exception
of
start-up
excedences,
which
i'll
talk
about
a
little
bit
more
later,
the
same
is
really
true
for
fecal
coliform;
that
is,
that
they
substantially
ended
in
1982.
we
had
more
problem
with
the
tkn
and
had
to
install
largely
a
new
system
and
there
were
various
fits
and
starts,
including
six-month
delay
by
the
state
water
control
board
itself,
but
the
system
was
finally
approved
by
the
state
and
it
began
operation
in
october
of
'83
and
it
was
fully
on
line
in
december.
so
that
the
only
tkn
excedences
between
then
and--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
the
alternative
to
violation
because
if
you
use
violation,
there
seems
to
be
some
import--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--pardon?
pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
it
is
my
understanding
it
is
regularly
used
in
the
industry.
it's
not
just
for
this
case.
what
it
means
is,
your
honor,
that
you
have
exceeded
the
limits
in
your
permit,
but
an
excedence,
of
course,
could
be
a
permissible
upset
or
could
be
for
other
permissible
reasons.
therefore,
it's
not
necessarily
a
violation.
and
as
i
was
saying,
the
excedences
here,
as
far
as
tkn
is
concerned,
were
the
unavoidable
start-up
excedences
before
suit.
the
district
court
held
that
there
is
no
way
to
start-up
a
biological
treatment
system
without
violations.
but
the
important
point
here,
really,
to
focus
on
is
that
the
last
fecal
coliform
excedence
was
four
months
before
suit,
tkn
was
a
full
month
before
suit,
and,
of
course,
the
chlorine
was
twenty
months
ago.
so,
the
case
comes
to
you
with
the
rather
pristine
question
of
whether
citizens
can
sue
for
purely
past
violations,
those
which
have
abated
prior
to
suit.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
can.
we
say
that
they
can't.
the
solicitor
general
interprets
the
act
as
we
do,
as
to
past
violations.
we
disagree
with
him
only
in
respect
as
how
he
interprets
the
word
"alleged"
in
the
statute
and,
therefore,
with
his
recommended
disposition.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
what
it
had,
justice
o'connor,
was--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--that
alternative
holding,
which
was
in
a
footnote,
was
that
even
if
you
couldn't
sue
for
past
violations,
that
there
was
a
good
faith
allegation
of
on-going
violations.
i
would
emphasize
in
regard
to
that,
first
of
all,
as
you
point
out,
the--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
if
you
reach
that
question
because
you
don't
have
to
reach
it,
of
course,
if
you
reach
that
question.
i
would
certainly
think
you
would
want
to
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
its
consideration,
but
you
shouldn't
have
to
reach
that
question
at
all
because
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
is
quite
clear,
both
from
the
facts,
the
holding
and
the
stipulation,
that
everything
had
stopped,
had
abated
prior
to
the
suit,
it
really
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
allegations
were
good
faith
or
not.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
that
regard,
justice
o'connor,
i
wonder
if
i
could
call
your
attention
to
footnotes,
i
think
they
are,
25
and
26
of
the
district
court's
opinion
because
he
very
well
addressed
those
particular
matters.
25
and
26,
where
he,
in
effect,
said
some
question
has
arisen
as
to
whether
these
problems
would
continue,
but
i
regard
that
as
entirely
too
speculative
to
find.
he,
in
effect,
holds
in
these
two
footnotes
that
the
problem
has
entirely
ceased
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
respondents
are
not
here
arguing
anything
about
good
faith
allegations
or
that
these
were
on-going
violations.
what
they
are
here
arguing
is
that
they
can
sue
for
past
violations
period.
they
posed
the
suit
because--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--that
is
an
interesting
question,
and
we
really
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
yet.
the
government
said
yes,
but
it's
interesting
that
xx--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--no,
with
great
respect,
your
honor,
it
is
not
the
same.
the
language
in
regard
to
the
government
is
in
section
309
or
1319,
and
the
language
is
quite
different.
it
is
so
different
that
the
government,
when
it
seeks
to
bring
a
suit
for
past
penalties,
doesn't
even
rely
on
this
statute.
it
relies
on
the
judicial
code.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right.
and
the
reason
they
do
that
is
the
language
is
really
not
clear
in
this
statute
itself
as
to
whether...
it's
a
very
convoluted
statute
when
it
comes
to
the
government's
rights,
but
certainly
even
if
the...
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
even
if
the
government
can
sue
for
past
violations,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
language
and
the
rights
are
very
different
from
those
that
relate
to
a
citizen
and
the
solicitor
general
is
very
strong
on
that
point,
that
he
does
not
believe
for
a
moment
that
a
citizen
has
the
same
rights
as,
and
comes
under
the
same
language
as,
the
government
does.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
would
be
very
fair,
your
honor,
if
that's
all
the
further
we
went,
but
the
fact
is
that
this
statute,
two
things
go
to
that.
first
of
all,
this
statute
uses
the
present
tense
in
at
least
four
other
places
in
this
same
1365.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
may
then
be
engaged
in
an
on-going
violation
and,
in
fact,
under
our
definition,
you
may
be
able
to
xx
because
an
on-going
xx
present
non-compliance
because
of
a
failure
to
correct
an
underlying
difficulty,
and
if
you
have
in
fact,
violated
for
several
times,
you
have
done
nothing
about
it,
and
the
suit
is
brought,
that
may
be
an
on-going
violation,
may
be
perfectly
proper
to
sue.
that's
not
what
happened
here.
in
this
suit,
what
happened
was
there
were
a
series
of
excedences
and
we
did
something
about
it.
we
put
in
place
with
a
new
systems
which
were
supposed
to
deal
with
it.
after
the
systems
were
in
place,
we
had
unavoidable
start-up
excedences,
which
could
not
be
avoided,
the
district
court
so
held,
they
were
no
more
normal,
the
district
court
again
held,
than
you
would
expect
in
an
ordinary
xx
the
xx
end
of
this,
knowing
that
the
situation
had
abated,
knowing
that
it
had
been
corrected
and
had
come
to
a
close,
that
respondent
come
in
and
sue.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
xx
an
the
district
court
ultimately
held
and
the
xx
pointed
out
to
you
and
where
he
said
we
were
xx
compliance
and
also.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
so,
and
this
is
the
reason
that
i
say
so,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
they
knew
that
the
new
equipment
had
been
put
in
secondly,
they
knew
that
it
had
been
completed.
they
attended
a
meeting
in
march
of
the
state
water
control
board
at
which
this
was
discussed,
and
the
state
water
control
board
said,
look,
we've
seen
it,
it
looks
to
us
like
you're
getting
this
thing
under
control.
there's
no
need
for
any
further
action.
then,
there
were
some
unavoidable
start-up
excedences.
i
keep
emphasizing
that
because
you
cannot
start
a
new
plant,
much
less
fix
an
old
plant,
without
having
some
of
these
unavoidable
start-up
excedences.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
let
me
say
two
things
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
even
the
unavoidable
start-up
excedences
had
ceased
prior
to
suit,
but,
secondly,
even
if
they
had
been
going
on,
it
may
well
be
that
a
start-up
excedence
would
be
a
past
violation
that,
for
example,
the
state
could
xx
after.
but
by
definition,
it
cannot
be
an
on-going
violation.
an
on-going
violation
is
something
where
something
is
going
on
because
of
a
problem
and
you
are
not
fixing
it,
you
are
not
doing
anything
about
it.
this
is
a
situation
where
we've
done
everything
about
it.
we
put
in
a
new
system.
we
spent
$265,000
putting
it
in.
it
is
now...
the
crust
is
starting
to
form
on
the
lagoon
which
takes
a
long
time.
that's
a
problem
getting
that
into
shape,
and
those
excedences
cannot
possibly
constitute
an
on-going
violation
by
their
very
nature.
they
are
the
tail-end
of
abatement.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
is
abatement.
the
statute,
you've
got
to
remember,
follows
directly
upon
the
clean
air
act,
and
the
clean
air
act,
as
you
will
recall,
had
only
an
injunctive
provision
in
it,
and
it
related
only
to
compliance,
only
to
on-going,
only
to
abatement.
the
one
thing
that
this
statute
added
to
the
clean
air
act
was
the
remedy
of
penalty,
and
that,
by
adding
the
penalty,
what,
it
seems
to
me,
congress
clearly
did
was
to
say
we're
going
to
add
an
extra
incentive
for
you
to
stop
sooner
because
by
saying
that
you're
going
to
get
penalties
and
not
just
an
injunction,
it
becomes
very
much
to
your
advantage
to
stop
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
during
the
sixty-day
period,
for
example.
you
get
your
sixty-day
notice.
if
you
can
abate
in
there
and
stop,
you
have
avoided
your
penalties
and
that's
what
the
act
is
entirely
about.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
i'm
not
sure
i
can
define
it
any
better
than
i
did
a
little
while
ago,
and
that
is
present
non-compliance
for
failure
to
correct
the
situation.
our
definition
would
be
that
if
there...
the
5th
circuit
pointed
this
out
in
sierra
club
v.
shell
oil
that
you
can't
just
take
an
excedence
here,
an
excedence
there,
and
kind
of
bunch
them
all
together
and
say
this
is
an
on-going
violation.
what
you
do
is
you
kind
of
look
behind
them
and
you
see
is
there
a
reason
for
this,
is
it
on-going,
do
you
have
here
somebody
who
has
just
turned
off
the
spigot
in
order
to
avoid
a
suit,
is
it
a
periodic
episodic
violator
who
is
just
trying
to
avoid
suit.
in
other
words,
the
district
court
can
look
at
the
facts
very
much
as
he
does
in
a
regular
injunction
proceeding
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
problem
which
is
creating
excedences
which
you
have
not
corrected,
you
have
not
done
anything
about.
if
you
have
not,
then
it
is
an
on-going
violation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
might
well.
now,
for
example,
let's
suppose
you
have
taken
some
action,
but
it's
the
improper
action,
it's
ineffective
action,
it's
not
enough
action,
it
won't
work,
that's
something
that
the
court
would
be
entitled
to
look
to
to
see
whether,
in
fact,
there
is
an
on-going
problem
that
you
have
not
properly
addressed.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
with
great
respect,
justice
o'connor,
that
just
isn't
possible
in
this
case
because
they
knew
that
we
had
installed
a
system.
they
knew
that
the
system
had
been
approved
by
the
state.
they
knew
that
thereafter
the
state
met
and
said
we
think
we've
got
this
under
control.
they
knew--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--that,
your
honor,
related
to
the
prior
period,
when
we
were
still
wrestling
with
getting
this
whole
thing
into
place,
and
we
may
well
have
been
in
violation,
in
an
on-going
violation
at
that
time.
it
may
be
that
we
could
have
sued
at
that
time,
but
he's
not
referring
to
the
later
period
where,
if
you'll
see,
i
think
this
joint
appendix
115,
in
that
area,
where
he
says
that
at
the
end,
which
is
the
period
we're
talking
about,
just
before
they
brought
suit,
these
were
unavoidable
and
were
anticipated.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
all
the
plans
that
the
state
had
looked
at
prior
to
that,
they
had
always
put
in
a
period
for
excedences
after
the
system
went
into
effect
because
they
knew
that
even
after
you
put
the
system
into
effect,
you're
going
to
have
a
period
of
excedences
that
you
can't
avoid.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
they
had
put
the
new
system
in
before
they
did,
it
would
have
stopped
sooner?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
there's
no
question
about
that,
your
honor,
and
i'm
not--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--that's--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
there's
no
possibility
of
filing
a
suit,
depending
upon
how
quickly
they
did
it
and
what
xx
but
this
suit
is
not
about,
and
even
respondents
do
not
say
it
is
about,
whether
the
penalties
were
correct,
assuming
that
penalties
should
be
issued
because
we
didn't
move
quickly
enough.
what
the
suit
is
about
is
whether
you
can
get
penalties
at
all
for
purely
past
violations
as--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--if
there
was
jurisdiction
at
the
time
that
the
suit
was
brought
because
there
was
an
on-going
violation
at
that
time,
the
district
court
got
jurisdiction.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
first
of
all,
i
assume
if
he
was
satisfied
with
the
compliance,
he
would
not
issue
an
injunction,
but
he
may
well
issue
penalties.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
for
the
period
up
until
the
time
that
they
stopped.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because,
your
honor,
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed,
there
was
jurisdiction
and
the
reason
that
there
was
jurisdiction
was
that
this
statute
required
an
on-going
violation
at
the
time
suit
was
filed
and
in
your
hypothetical,
there
was
an
on-going
violation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely.
the
government
and
we
are
very
close
on
our
interpretation
of
that,
and
perhaps
i
ought
to
turn
then
to
one
difference
between
us
and
the
government
before
i
come
back
to
other
matters.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
what
i
would
say
under
those
circumstances
is
that
he
should
not
issue
an
injunction
if
he's
satisfied
that
there
is
true
compliance
and
abatement,
but
that
he
may
well
decide
to
issue
penalties
because
he
had
jurisdiction
at
the
time
that
the
suit
was
brought.
now,
i
want
to
say
just
one
thing
before
i
get
to
this
business
of
allegations.
i
just
want
to
point
out
to
you
that,
really,
this
statute
makes
no
sense
if
you're
going
to
treat
it
as
going
to
past
violations.
let
me
just
give
you
two
brief
examples.
the
citizen
would
be
giving
notice
of
something
that's
already
abated.
all
the
courts
that
have
looked
at
this
agree
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
giving
sixty-day
notice
to
the
permit
holder
is
to
allow
him
to
get
himself
into
shape
and
to
abate,
to
get
rid
of
the
problem.
here
you
have
a
situation
where
somebody
is
suing
for
penalties
five
years
old,
maybe
fifteen
years
old,
because
we
don't
know
what
the
statute
of
limitations
is.
there
is
none
in
the
statute.
so,
you're
suing
for
fifteen
years
old
and
you're
giving
the
man
sixty
days
notice
for
what?
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
the
only
thing
that
makes
sense
is
that
you're
giving
him
sixty
days
notice
of
an
on-going
violation.
one
other
example.
the
citizen
couldn't
sue
for
past
violations
when
the
administrator
is
already
suing
for
on-going
violations.
i
realize
this
is
a
little
difficult,
but
if
you
will
look
at
the
language
in
1365,
you
will
see
that
what
it
says
is
that
when
the
administrator
is
actively
prosecuting
a
suit
for
compliance,
the
citizen
can't
come
in
and
sue.
now,
the
only
way
that
makes
any
sense
at
all
is
if
they're
both
trying
to
sue
for
the
same
thing;
that
is,
the
citizen
is
trying
to
sue
for
an
on-going
violation,
and
the
government
is
suing
for
an
on-going
violation.
if
you
have
the
citizen
stopped
from
suing
for
past
violations
because
the
government
is
suing
for
present
or
the
government
is
not
suing
for
present
and
they
are
both
suing
at
the
time,
same
time,
for
past,
it
doesn't...
the
statute
doesn't
hang
together.
it
makes
no
sense.
but
let
me
move
then
to
the
one
point
of
difference
between
us
and
the
solicitor
general,
and
that
is
this
business
of
the
allegation.
he
puts
a
great
deal
of
stress
on
the
word
"alleged",
and
he
feels
that
a
good
faith
allegation
of
on-going
violation
gets
the
citizens
past
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
an
on-going
violation.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize,
as
we've
already
pointed
out,
that
the
court
of
appeals
never
passed
on
this,
and
that
even
the
district
court
said
that
the
good
faith
allegation
related
only
to
tkn
and,
justice
o'connor,
tkn
was
the
smaller
part,
as
you
know,
of
the
award.
a
million
dollars
was
for
chlorination,
which
stopped
twenty
months
before.
but
even
as
to
tkn,
that's
very
confusing
because
the
government
concedes
that
once
you
make
an
allegation
and
we
contest
it
under
12(b)(1),
the
court
can
go
behind
it,
and
all
we're
saying
is
here
you
xx
allege
all
you
want
to
that
something
is
on-going
but
if,
in
fact,
we
challenge
you,
you
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
it's
true.
this
is
true
in
any
kind
of
a
suit.
it's
true
in
a
suit
where
i
file
a
suit
against
you
on
diversity
grounds
in
pennsylvania
and
i
attach
all
of
your
prior
reports
to
show
you
were
there
and
you
file
a
motion
dismissing
saying
i'm
sorry
i
moved
into
your
state
of
maryland
since
my
last
report.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
but
look
what
that
does,
your
honor.
someone
who
files
a
group
of
dmrs
just
as
someone
who
files
your
last
ten
quarterly
reports
would,
in
good
faith,
believe
that
we
are
in
the
midst
of
an
on-going
violation
or
that
you
are
located
in
pennsylvania.
but
if
that
is
attacked
and,
in
fact,
you
have
moved
from
pennsylvania
into
maryland
and
if,
in
fact,
our
violations
have
come
to
a
halt
prior
to
suit,
they
have
been
abated,
they
have
been
cleaned
up
and
stopped,
which
is
the
purpose
of
the
act,
then
all
we're
saying
is
that
you
can't
go
ahead
with
a
suit
where
a
mere
allegation
gets
you
to
trial.
if
the
allegation
is
wrong,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
your
good
faith
is,
it
is
wrong.
i
see
i
don't
have
much
time
left,
and
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
save
just
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
just
a
few
very
quick
point,
your
honor.
i
would
urge
that
you
read
the
end
of
footnote
9
which
my
good
friend
for
the
respondent
xx
did
not
get
to,
and
call
your
attention
to
the
first
part
of
it.
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
almost
a
year
after
the
last
violation,
which
clearly
alerted
the
district
court
judge
that
there
had
been
no
violations
during
the
course
of
that
year
when
he
ruled
he
was
fully
familiar
with
that.
i
have
to
go
outside
of
the
record
to
make
the
following
statement,
and
that
is
that
there
have
been
none
for
now
four
years,
and
i
say
that
with
equanimity
because
i
am
sure
my
respondents
won't
dispute
it.
there
was
one
hurricane
upset,
but
other
than
that.
the
problem
with
the
article
3
is
that
i
think
it
may
be
directed
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
to
perhaps
the
wrong
point.
the
real
problem
with
article
3
is
redressability;
that
is,
when
all
of
the
penalties
go
to
the
government
and
you
don't
have
an
injunction
going
to
the
underlying
fact,
you
have
an
injury
that
is
not
redressed
by
any
remedy
and
that
xx
the
article
3.
xx
the
court
to
be
very
careful
here
if
it's
going
to
open
the
flood
gates
to
these
past
suits
because
you
know
you're
not
only
going
to
have
these
federal
suits
for
going
back
we
don't
know
how
many
years,
maybe
fifteen,
but
we're
going
to
have
many
state
claims,
you're
going
to
be
trying
state
claims
in
federal
courts
going
back
fifteen
years,
which
is
going
to
be
attached
to
these
federal
claims,
which
is
going
to
cause
great
hazard
to
the
federal
courts.
thank
you
very
much.
