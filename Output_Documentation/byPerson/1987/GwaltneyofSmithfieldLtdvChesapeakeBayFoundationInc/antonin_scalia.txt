justice
scalia
mr.
prettyman,
the
language
governing
private
civil
actions
doesn't
say
has
violated,
but
it
doesn't
say
is
violating
either.
it
says
is
in
violation
of.
justice
scalia
now,
that,
it
seems
to
me,
means
something
quite
different
from
is
now
violating.
if
you're
caught
by
radar
exceeding
the
speed
limit
and
a
police
car
pulls
along
side
you
after
you
realized
that
you've
been
caught
and
you've
lowered
your
speed,
he
doesn't
say
into
your
window,
you
are
violating
the
speed
limit,
you
were
violating
it
five
miles
back.
he
will
say,
you
know,
you
were
in
violation
of
the
speed
limit.
justice
scalia
but
the
present
tense
speaking
of
a
status,
the
status
of
being
in
violation.
now,
what
if
i
think
that
that
status
means
you
violated
it
in
the
past
and
you
haven't
done
anything
that
seems
likely
to
eliminate
that
possibility
of
violation
in
the
future?
what
if
i
considered
that
to
be
what
in
violation
of
means?
justice
scalia
is
had
knowledge
clear?
you
said
that
the
last
violation,
the
tkn
violation
was,
excedence,
if
you
want
xx
way
was
one
month
before
suit
was
filed.
but
at
the
time
suit
was
filed
was
it
clear
that
the
new
equipment
you
had
put
in
would
do
the
job?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
ask
whether
you
were;
i
asked
was
it
clear
at
the
time
that
the
suit
was
filed
that
the
new
equipment
was
effective
to
do
the
job.
justice
scalia
but
the
notice
doesn't
just
go
to
the
government;
it's
notice
both
to
the
government
and
to
the
violator.
what's
the
reason
for
the
notice
to
the
violator?
justice
scalia
on
that
analysis,
you
would
say
that
congress
would
have
the
power
to
confer
standing
upon
any
citizen
to
prosecute
violations
of
crimes
within
his
community,
right?
congress
could
pass
a
law
saying
the
united
states
attorney
shall
no
longer
be
the
sole
person
who
can
prosecute
crimes,
but
any
person
in
the
community
in
which
a
crime
occurred
may
bring
a
prosecution?
justice
scalia
--mr.
claiborne,
that
section
may
bring
the
realization
of
the
question
i
asked
you
because
it
permits
the
citizen
to
intervene
as
a
matter
of
right
in
the
criminal
action
apparently.
