justice

if
they
put
it
in
twelve
months
ahead
of
time,
they
wouldn't
have
had
that
problem,
would
they?
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
there
would
have
been
no
possibility
of
filing
a
suit.
justice
marshall
but
they
didn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
here,
the
clean
water
act
provides
that
states
may
grant
permits
authorizing
the
discharge
of
set
levels
of
certain
pollutants
under
certain
conditions.
after
receiving
a
permit
from
the
state
of
virginia,
petitioner
repeatedly
violated
the
conditions
of
the
permit
by
exceeding
effluent
limitations.
the
respondents
filed
suit
against
that.
the
petitioner
moved
to
dismiss
the
respondent's
suit
for
lack
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction,
arguing
that
the
alleged
violations
occurred
wholly
in
the
past
and
that
section
505
of
the
act
which
authorizes
citizen
suits
does
not
grant
jurisdiction
over
suits
attacking
such
violation.
the
district
court
held
that
section
505
permits
federal
courts
to
exercise
subject-matter
jurisdiction
over
suits
for
wholly
past
violations.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
ground
that
those
violations
are
encompassed
by
section
505
and
that
they
could
pass
on
the
district
court's
alternative
holding.
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
conclude
that
section
505
does
confer
jurisdiction
over
citizen
suits
where
the
citizen
plaintiffs
make
a
good
faith
allegation
of
continuous
or
intermittent
violation.
we,
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
remand
the
change
for
consideration
of
the
good
faith
allegation
issue.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
o'connor
have
joined.
