justice
white
mr.
prettyman,
suppose
there
is
an
on-going
violation
under
your
own
definition
at
the
time
the
suit
is
filed,
but
within
two
or
three
months,
the
whole
matter
is
cleared
up,
now,
you
would
say
the
suit
was
proper
at
the
outset,
but
does
it
then...
should
it
then
be
dismissed
when
there
is
compliance?
justice
white
got
jurisdiction
and
the
citizens
suit
was
proper
at
that
time.
justice
white
what
happens
then
when
there
is
compliance?
justice
white
for
what?
justice
white
why
could
he...
well,
why
should
he
be
able
to
issue
penalties
for
violations
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
suit?
justice
white
so,
you
essentially
agreed
with
the
government
in
that
regard?
justice
white
once
the
trial
was
over,
how
does
the
court
know
what's
happened
between
the
time
the
record
is
closed
and
he
writes
the
opinion?
justice
white
well,
i
would
suppose
that
he
was
reflecting
in
these
footnotes
what
was
true
at
the
termination
of
the
trial.
justice
white
that
would
be
the
normal...
wouldn't
that
be
the
normal
assumption?
justice
white
that
he'd
be
writing
his
opinion
based
on
the
record
that
was
made.
justice
white
well,
why
shouldn't
the
rule
be
for
this
jurisdictional
argument
or
the
citizen
bringing
suit,
at
the
time
of
filing
the
suit,
which
in
a
lot
of
courts
will
be
an
awful
long
time
before
the
trial.
justice
white
so,
you
want
us
to
take
the
case
as
it
comes
to
us
and
decide
whether
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
or
wrong?
justice
white
on
its
theory?
justice
white
you
never
got
to
your
third
reason,
the
third
way
that
a
citizen...
that
this
person
is
affected.
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
are
attorneys'
fees
available
in
these
suits?
