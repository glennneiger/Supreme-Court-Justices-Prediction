the
other
case,
pinter
against
dahl,
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
pinter,
is
an
oil
and
gas
producer
and
securities
dealer,
and
he
sold
unregistered
securities
consisting
of
fractional
undivided
interests
in
oil
and
gas
leases
to
the
respondent,
dahl,
was
experienced
in
oil
and
gas
ventures.
and
dahl
told
friends
and
family
and
business
associates
about
the
venture
and
assisted
them
in
completing
the
subscription
agreement
forms.
he
received
no
commission
from
pinter
when
they
invested.
the
venture
failed
and
dahl
and
his
groups
sued
pinter
in
federal
courts
seeking
rescission
under
section
12(1)
of
the
1933
securities
act.
a
bench
trial
was
held
and
the
court
granted
judgment
for
the
plaintiff's
rejecting
pinter's
defense
to
dahl's
suit
that
we
call
in
pari
delicto
and
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
it
ruled
that
that
defense
was
not
available
in
a
section
12(1)
action.
and
it
also
ruled
that
dahl
was
not
a
seller
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
therefore,
he
could
not
be
held
liable
in
contribution.
we
vacate
that
judgment
and
remand
the
case.
we
hold
that
the
in
pari
delicto
defense
is
available
in
a
section
12(1)
private
rescission
action.
we
also
hold
that
a
nonowner
of
a
security
must
solicit
to
purchase
motivated
at
least
in
part
by
a
desire
to
benefit
himself
before
he
qualifies
as
a
seller
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
term
seller
is
not
limited
to
an
owner
who
passes
title
or
other
interest
in
the
security
to
a
buyer
for
value.
at
the
same
time,
the
term
offer
in
section
2(3)
of
the
act
does
not
include
every
possible
solicitation.
here,
the
record
is
insufficient
to
determine
whether
dahl
maybe
liable
as
a
statutory
seller.
there
are
no
findings
below
that
focus
on
whether
he
urged
the
other
respondents
to
invest
in
order
to
further
some
financial
interests
of
his
own
or
at
pinter.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
justice
kennedy
took
no
part.
