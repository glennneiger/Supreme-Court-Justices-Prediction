justice
stevens
mr.
sparks,
was
the
legal
prospectus
the
one
that
would
have
pertained
to
the
transaction
that
gave
rise
to
this
suit?
justice
stevens
do
you
contend
that
it
was?
justice
stevens
are
we
supposed
to
draw
that
inference
from
what
you
are
telling
us?
justice
stevens
you
mean
he
introduced
him
to
his
former
employee?
justice
stevens
oh,
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
that
you
were
saying
that
pinter
had
previously
worked
for
dahl.
justice
stevens
i
am
sorry.
i
did
not
follow
your
statement
as
well
as
i
should
have.
justice
stevens
while
you
are
interrupted,
mr.
sparks.
justice
stevens
this
transaction
with
mr.
gottsch,
the
first
half
that
you
described,
was
gottsch
one
of
the
plaintiffs?
justice
stevens
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
claims
of
the
eleven
other
people?
justice
stevens
maybe
he
solicited
a
lot
of
people.
but
if
they
are
not
the
people
that
are
involved
in
the
lawsuit,
how
does
that
bear
on
the
lawsuit?
justice
stevens
yes.
maybe
he
did
or
did
not
solicit
the
eleven
people
involved,
but
would
it
prove
solicitation
of
these
eleven
if
he
solicited
mr
x,
y,
z?
i
do
not
follow
that.
justice
stevens
supposedly
you
proved
that
he
committed
an
egregious
violation
with
respect
to
mr.
gottsch,
would
that
be
a
defense
that
mr.
pinter
could
assert
in
the
claim?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
you
are
only
claiming
in
pari
delicto
insofar
as
the
claim
by
dahl
against
pinter?
justice
stevens
you
are
not
claiming
that
it
has
any
bearing
on
the
claims
of
the
other
eleven
or
right
to
contribution
or
anything
like
that?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
statutory
basis,
or
is
a
state
law
basis,
for
your
contribution
claim?
justice
stevens
mr.
sparks,
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
you
again.
but
you
told
me
that
you
are
relying
on
section
11
for
the
right
of
contribution.
is
this
not
a
section
12
suit?
justice
stevens
section
11
applies
to
misstatements
in
prospectuses,
does
it
not?
justice
stevens
section
12
is
where
you
have
no
registration
at
all,
is
it
not?
justice
stevens
so
the
contribution
right
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
does
it?
justice
stevens
has
any
court
so
held
in
a
section
12
case?
justice
stevens
who
passes
title
is
the
seller.
justice
stevens
if
i
can
ask
one
other
question
about
the
seller.
is
it
necessary
to
be
a
seller
in
order
to...
i
mean
is
it
not
possible
that
dahl
could
not
be
a
seller
and
nevertheless
the
defense
of
in
pari
delicto
would
be
available?
justice
stevens
and
is
it
also
not
possible
that
he
could
be
a
seller
and
nevertheless
the
claim
of
contribution
would
fail?
justice
stevens
so
it
may
be
true
that
we
do
not
have
to
decide
the
seller
issue?
justice
stevens
mr.
taranto,
would
you
do
one
more
thing
because
your
time
is
short.
would
you
be
sure
to
explain
to
me
the
difference
between
the
position
that
you
now
advocate
and
the
one
that
you
set
forth
in
your
brief,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
get
that.
