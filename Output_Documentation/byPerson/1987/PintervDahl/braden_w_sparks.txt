mr.
braden
w.
sparks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
this
morning
is
important
because
it
bears
upon
the
day
to
day
regulation
of
the
securities
industry,
and
it
has
to
do
with
two
issues
that
concern
section
12(1)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
which
provides
for
an
express
private
right
of
action
against
any
person
who
offers
or
sells
an
unregistered
security
through
the
use
of
the
mails
or
the
interstate
commerce.
i
would
like
to
state
the
questions
as
follows.
first
of
all,
whether
the
long
established
definition
of
a
section
12(1)
seller
under
the
securities
act
of
1933
and
section
12(1)
specifically
should
be
modified
to
incorporate
a
new
threshold
requirement
that
the
seller
must
be
motivated,
and
i
would
like
to
stress
that
word
motivated,
by
a
desire
to
receive
a
financial
benefit
for
his
efforts
in
order
to
be
held
responsible
for
his
conduct.
and
secondly,
whether
or
not
the
common
law
in
pari
delicto
defense,
or
perhaps
i
would
prefer
to
refer
to
this
as
the
regulatory
purpose
defense
rather
than
strict
in
pari
delicto
defense,
is
available
in
a
private
action
for
the
rescission
of
the
sale
of
unregistered
securities
brought
under
section
12(1).
just
briefly,
the
statute
provides
that
any
person
who
offers
or
sells
a
security
in
violation
of
section
77(e)
of
this
title
shall
be
liable
to
the
person
purchasing
such
security
from
him,
and
it
goes
on
to
provide
for
rescission
in
the
common
law
fashion.
to
telegraph
my
position
in
this
case,
the
fifth
circuit's
addition
of
a
pecuniary
benefits
test
to
the
settled
definition
of
a
seller
of
unregistered
securities
is
damaging
and
threatening
to
the
continued
regulation
of
the
securities
industry
in
my
opinion.
and
the
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
in
pari
delicto
defense
does
not
apply
between
co-violators
of
section
12(1)
is
in
direct
conflict
with
this
court's
ruling
in
the
bateman
eichler
case.
i
think
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
extremely
important,
and
i
would
like
to
spend
a
certain
amount
of
time
with
regard
to
the
facts.
of
course,
in
the
trial
court,
mr.
pinter
was
a
defendant,
and
mr.
dahl
was
one
of
twelve
plaintiffs.
mr.
dahl
and
the
other
eleven
plaintiffs
sought
to
recover
from
mr.
pinter
for
the
sale
of
unregistered
securities.
the
complaint
detailed
a
number
of
misrepresentations,
and
concealments,
and
non-disclosures
on
the
part
of
mr.
pinter
doing
business
under
the
various
names
of
his
companies.
mr.
dahl,
the
trial
court
found,
was
a
california
or
texas
resident,
a
real
estate
broker,
and
a
man
whose
personal
wealth
exceeded
one
million
dollars,
and
whose
income
approached
$250,000
on
an
annual
basis.
and
he
detailed
certain
abortive
efforts,
and
i
am
at
paragraph
7
on
page
31
of
the
petition,
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
the
trial
court
detailed
certain
abortive
efforts
by
mr.
dahl
to
become
interested
in
the
oil
business.
i
would
like
to
quote
from
the
record.
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
everything
that
i
quote
from
the
record
will
be
either
from
mr.
dahl's
testimony
who
i
am
in
opposition
to,
or
from
the
testimony
of
mr.
gottsch
who
was
called
on
behalf
of
mr.
dahl.
i
am
not
attempting
to
support
my
arguments
by
any
statements
made
by
my
client
in
this
case.
mr.
dahl
testified
at
the
joint
appendix,
page
105,
that
he
was
interested
in
being
in
the
drilling
business,
and
that
he
did
not
have
the
money
that
he
needed
to
become
involved
in
the
business,
and
that
he
hired
mr.
minor
whose
position
was
to
"raise
money",
and
that
is
quote.
and
that
it
was
his
job,
and
this
was
mr.
minor
who
was
hired
by
mr.
dahl
to
work
for
puma
petroleum
and
wrangle
oil
&
gas,
it
was
his
job
to
bring
investor
money.
and
mr.
minor
was
fired
by
mr.
dahl
prior
to
his
hiring
of
a
mr.
kirk
when
it
became
known
to
mr.
dahl
that
he
had
spent
$10,000
to
obtain
a
legal
prospective,
and
he
was
fired
on
that
basis.
and
then
mr.
dahl
then
hired
another
individual
by
the
name
of
mr.
kirk,
who
was
in
the
texas
and
oklahoma
area
attempting
to
acquire
leases
for
mr.
dahl
who
was
living
in
california.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
the
record
does
not
say,
your
honor.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
sir?
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
the
only
inference
that
i
would
like
the
court
to
draw
is
that
mr.
dahl
was
aware
of
the
need
to
draw
a
prospectus
in
becoming
involved
in
the
oil
and
gas
business,
and
had
hired
mr.
minor
for
that
purpose,
and
fired
him
when
he
discovered
that
he
had
spent
$10,000
in
that
way.
the
position
of
the
government,
the
attorney
general,
is
that
one
must
be
a
promoter
if
one
is
interested
in
becoming
involved
in
the
business,
more
a
promoter
than
an
investor,
and
one
may
be
held
in
pari
delicto.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
i
am
trying
to
isolate
in
my
discussion
of
the
facts
those
facts
which
would
show
that
mr.
dahl
was
desirous
of
getting
into
the
oil
and
gas
business,
and
that
it
was
his
intention
to
not
be
merely
a
investor
at
least
initially.
i
think
that
the
inference
that
i
have
explained
is
all
that
needs
to
be
drawn
from
that
fact.
mr.
kirk
was
hired
after
mr.
minor
was
fired.
his
job,
and
this
is
page
108
from
the
joint
appendix,
was
to
locate,
acquire
and
sell
leases.
and
mr.
kirk
introduced
mr.
dahl
to
mr.
pinter
as
a
knowledgeable
and
capable
oil
man.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
mr.
kirk,
of
course,
was
mr.
dahl's
agent
in
that
introduction.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
mr.
kirk,
the
new
employee,
introduced
mr.
dahl,
his
employer,
to
mr.
pinter,
an
oil
man,
who
was
in
the
oklahoma
oil
and
gas
business.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
no,
sir.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
mr.
kirk
was
working
for
mr.
dahl.
he
found
mr.
pinter
in
oklahoma,
and
introduced
mr.
pinter
to
mr.
dahl
as
a
knowledgeable
oil
and
gas
man
who
was
working
in
oklahoma.
then
mr.
pinter
came
to
oklahoma
and
visited
the
properties,
and
looked
at
the
geology,
the
well
logs
and
the
other
materials
which
were
assembled
in
the
words
of
the
trial
court
by
mr.
pinter.
and
after
conducting
his
own
investigation
of
the
circumstanced
decided
in
the
trial
court's
words
that
there
"no
way
that
he
could
lose
investing.
"
now
there
were
two
different
groups
of
investments
which
were
made
by
mr.
dahl,
and
i
would
like
to
point
this
out
and
go
into
some
detail
here.
because
again
it
is
important,
because
it
deals
with
mr.
dahl's
involvement
and
the
extent
to
which
he
may
be
considered
to
be
actively
involved
in
seeking
oil
and
gas
business
opportunities.
after
deciding
that
he
wanted
to
invest
with
mr.
pinter,
he
went
up
to
kansas
where
he
found
his
friend,
a
mr.
gottsch,
who
testified
for
him
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
gottsch
was
in
the
cattle
feeding
business,
and
was
an
independently
wealthy
individual.
he
contacted
mr.
gottsch,
in
his
own
words,
brought
mr.
gottsch
to
oklahoma,
and
introduced
mr.
gottsch
to
mr.
pinter
in
oklahoma.
and
as
a
result
of
that
introduction,
he
caused
mr.
gottsch
to
loan
him,
mr.
dahl,
$250,000
and
to
put
$250,000
of
his
own
money
into
the
initial
three
well
project
that
the
two
men
got
involved
in.
and
they,
mr.
dahl
and
his
friend,
mr.
gottsch
from
kansas
put
up
the
entire
$500,000
needed
to
fund
the
first
three
of
five
wells
that
will
be
discussed
here.
they
bought
all
of
the
available
interest
money
in
those
three
wells.
mr.
dahl
put
not
one
penny
of
his
own
money
into
those
three
wells.
he
caused
mr.
gottsch
to
loan
him
the
money
and
solicited,
i
believe
that
it
is
very
fair
to
say,
mr.
gottsch
with
regard
to
that
transaction.
mr.
gottsch
and
mr.
dahl
then
went
into
business
with
mr.
pinter
in
effect
drilling
the
first
three
wells.
sometime
prior
to
that,
mr.
pinter
had
begun
the
process
of
drilling
two
additional
wells.
in
the
words
of
mr.
dahl,
he
decided
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
him
to
go
to
mr.
pinter
and
to
suggest
to
mr.
pinter
that
he
had
certain
friends
and
relatives
in
california
who
would
be
very
interested
in
these
other
two
wells,
since
they
seemed
like
a
sure
deal
as
far
as
he
was
concerned.
and
so
he
went
to
mr.
pinter
and
suggested
to
mr.
pinter
that
he
would
involve
his
friends
in
california.
pinter
gave
him
some
investment
contracts.
he
took
the
investment
contracts
in
hand,
some
of
which
were
in
blank
and
some
of
which
were
made
out
in
the
name
of
maurice
dahl
or
assignee.
he
then
took
these.
they
had
not
been
fractionalized.
they
were
simply
blank
investment
contracts.
he
took
them
to
california,
and
went
to
eleven
of
his
friends
and
sold
them
interests,
and
made
all
representations
and
all
communications
to
each
of
the
people
in
california.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
no,
sir.
they
had
blanks
in
them
for
the
percentage
of
interest
that
the
investor
would
buy.
they
had
a
blank
for
the
name
of
the
investor.
or
in
some
cases,
instead
of
a
blank,
they
said
maurice
dahl
or
assignee.
so
they
were
blank
only
in
those
respects.
as
to
the
amount
of
money,
as
to
the
percentage
of
interest
in
the
various
wells,
and
as
to
the
person
who
was
acquiring
the
interest.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
no,
sir,
he
did
not
sue.
he
testified
on
behalf
of
mr.
dahl,
but
he
was
not
a
plaintiff
in
the
action.
he
testified
at
trial
that
he
was
looking,
to
put
it
in
his
words,
and
this
at
113
in
the
joint
appendix,
"i
was
looking
to
maurice.
"
"whoever
he
was
in
business
with,
that
was
not
of
merit
to
me.
"
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
the
only
importance
that
mr.
gottsch
has
is
that
i
believe
that
it
is
very
fair
to
say
that
mr.
dahl
solicited
mr.
gottsch.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
well,
to
me,
sir,
it
is
circumstantial
evidence
of
mr.
dahl's
solicitor
type
behavior.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
fundamental
to
section
12(1)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933,
especially
when
understood
on
its
face
and
also
from
the
legislative
history
of
that
act,
and
president
roosevelt's
comments
when
he
introduced
the
bill
and
asked
that
it
be
passed,
that
the
whole
idea
was
to
shift
the
burden
of
responsibility
on
the
person
who
made
solicitive
type
of
comments
or
representational
activity
in
connection.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
no,
sir.
but
in
pari
delicto,
actually
what
i
referred
to
as
the
regulatory
purpose
defense,
the
whole
issue
is
to
look
at
what
mr.
dahl
did.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
it
would
be
evidentiary
of
his
conduct
in
pari
delicto;
yes,
sir.
i
might
point
out,
justice
stevens,
that
at
the
trial
court
that
mr.
dahl
bore
down
exceedingly
hard
in
attempting
to
establish
that
all
of
these
transactions
were
integrated.
now
on
appeal,
the
position
is
that
these
are
separate
transactions.
and
i
might
point
out
also
that
the
trial
court
found
that
each
of
the
sales
involved
from
the
defendant
to
the
various
plaintiffs
including
mr.
dahl
were
related.
that
was
the
word
that
the
trial
court
used
in
describing
the
various
oil
wells
and
investments.
now
mr.
gottsch's
involvement
is
simply
circumstantial
evidence
of
mr.
dahl's
attempt
to
solicit
others
in
the
offer,
sale
and
delivery
of
unregistered
securities.
the
statute
being
a
strict
liability
statute,
clearly
mr.
pinter
is
responsible
under
section
12(1).
it
was
never
contended
otherwise.
his
position
is
to
allow
the
judgment
to
be
affirmed
with
regard
to
the
other
eleven
plaintiffs.
and
solely
with
respect
to
mr.
dahl,
he
is
asserting
the
defense
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
and
would
not
further
the
statutory
purpose
of
allow
mr.
dahl
to
recover
against
him,
because
mr.
dahl
was
fundamentally
responsible
in
the
words
of...
yes,
sir.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
we
did
not
appeal
with
regard
to
12(1)
violations
as
to
the
others.
we
do
contend
that
mr.
dahl
should
be
responsible
in
contribution
along
with
mr.
pinter
to
the
other
plaintiffs.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
the
securities
laws,
your
honor,
section
11,
for
example,
provides
for
a
right
of
contribution
between
joint
tort
feasors.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
that
is
correct;
yes,
your
honor.
equally
responsible
for
the
same
statutory
violation.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
yes,
sir.
they
invoked
a
pecuniary
benefit
test
to
get
around,
from
my
position,
in
order
to
substantiate
the
decision
that
he
was
not
a
seller.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
yes,
sir.
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
his
conduct
was
a
substantial
factor
in
the
sale
of
unregistered
securities.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
but
that
he
was
not
motivated
by
a
desire
for
pecuniary
benefit
directly
or
indirectly,
which
seems
to
me
to
fall
right
in
the
face
of
the
dirks
opinion
which
talks
about
representational
benefit
at
the
very
least.
and
which
seems
to
me
on
the
facts,
even
the
facts
as
adduced
by
the
fifth
circuit,
to
be
inappropriate
as
a
conclusion,
as
a
matter
of
factual
conclusion,
your
honor.
this
was
a
man
who
was
trying
to
get
into
the
business
and
who
was
also
trying
in
the
words
of
judge
brown
to
capitalize
his
own
investment,
and
thought
that
it
was
appropriate
to
do
so
by
going
to
california
and
selling
other
investors
in
this
very
same
project.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
inappropriate
to
conclude
that
he
was
acting
merely
gregariously
which
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
said.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
was
in
the
words
of
judge
jones
happy
hour
cocktail
conversationalist
type
of
advice.
this
was
not
simply
a
comment.
and
in
the
words
of
the
government,
they
contend
that
strongly
urging
someone
to
become
involved
without
being
motivated
by
pecuniary
benefit
constitutes
non-seller
and
non-solicitation
conduct.
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
position.
it
seems
to
me
that
fundamental
to
the
securities
act
of
1933
is
this
concept
that
the
burden
must
be
shifted.
and
i
am
essentially
quoting
from
the
legislative
history,
house
report
85.
every
lawyer
knows
that
all
facts
in
control
of
the
defendant
that
it
is
practically
impossible
for
a
buyer
to
prove
a
state
of
knowledge
or
failure
to
exercise
due
care
on
the
part
of
a
defendant.
how
are
you
going
to
show
what
the
motivation
was
in
the
mind
of
someone
who
is
selling
a
security?
that
it
going
to
get
from
the
trial
lawyer's
standpoint
and
from
the
litigation
standpoint
into
a
swearing
match
and
i
think
unnecessarily,
and
it
would
protract
litigation
to
have
a
test
like
that.
h.r.
85
in
1933,
"is
to
involve
paper
liability,
it
is
necessary
to
throw
the
burden
of
disproving
responsibility
for
reprehensible
acts
of
omission
or
commission
on
those
who
purport
to
issue
statements.
"
it
seems
to
me
that
the
gravamen
of
the
wrong,
if
you
will,
the
statutory
wrong,
is
to
sell.
you
cannot
go
to
california
with
a
bunch
of
investment
contracts
in
your
briefcase
and
sit
down
with
your
friends,
including
your
banker,
and
a
man
who
is
in
the
contracting
business
with
you,
and
your
accountant,
and
your
partner
in
a
business
deal,
and
your
employer
and
employees,
and
these
were
the
individuals
from
the
record
and
from
mr.
dahl's
testimony
were
the
people
purchased
and
none
of
whom
knew
each
other
in
the
admission
of
the
respondent
prior
to
mr.
dahl's
selling
them,
you
cannot
go
to
those
people,
those
kinds
of
people,
sit
there
with
an
investment
contract
and
fill
out
the
blanks
without
assuming
some
fiduciary
responsibility
it
seems
to
me
to
them
to
tell
them
the
truth.
now
mr.
dahl's
position
is
i
am
not
a
seller,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
absurd.
he
is
a
seller.
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
is
not
directly
receiving
some
pecuniary
benefit
does
not
mean
that
he
is
not
receiving
some
pecuniary
benefit.
certainly,
he
is,
because
he
is
capitalizing
the
investment
that
he
is
trying
to
become
involved
in.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
it
is
a
section
12
lawsuit
from
the
standpoint
of
the
plaintiffs;
yes,
sir.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
section
12.2.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
i
believe
that
it
does,
your
honor.
and
i
have
addressed
that
in
my
brief,
and
i
do
believe
that
there
is
a
right
of
contribution
under
common
law.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
no,
your
honor,
no
court
has
so
held
in
a
section
12
case.
and
i
might
point
out
that
i
do
believe
that
that
issue
has
been
perfected.
because
i
attempted
at
the
time
of
trial
to
have
mr.
dahl
realigned
as
a
third
party
defendant
from
the
outset,
and
the
trial
court
refused
to
realign
him
as
a
third
party
defendant.
and
i
was
not
able
to
assert
the
contribution
defense
at
that
time.
it
was
submitted
to
a
magistrate.
and
i
appealed
that,
and
it
was
overruled
by
operation
of
law.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
correct.
what
the
trial
court
found
was
that
mr.
dahl
did
not
receive
a
commission
from
the
sale
of
unregistered
securities.
the
trial
court
did
not
enter
a
finding
with
respect
to
direct
or
indirect
pecuniary
benefit.
and
the
fifth
circuit
decided
that
he
was
merely
gregarious.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
braden
w.
sparks
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
a
couple
of
questions
very
quickly.
as
to
the
disclosure
issue,
counsel
has
argued
i
submit
outside
of
the
record
that
there
were
omissions.
the
trial
court
found
that
there
were
no
violations
of
10(b)(5),
no
omissions,
and
that
there
were
no
acts
that
constituted
a
violation
of
section
10(b)(5)
in
paragraph
25
of
the
court's
findings.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
response
to
the
questions
of
justices
scalia
and
white
that
with
regard
to
the
in
pari
delicto
test
suggested
by
the
government
that
they
suggest
that
one
ought
to
be
a
promoter
and
somehow
be
involved
in
the
decision
not
to
register,
or
involved
in
the
conduct
that
results
in
the
loss
of
the
exemption.
and
i
submit
that
in
a
12(1)
context,
a
strict
liability
context,
that
this
puts
again
the
burden
on
establishing
a
state
of
mind
that
a
decision
was
made
not
to
register,
and
that
a
decision
was
made
to
take
the
transaction
outside
the
exemptions.
i
submit
that
that
again
flies
in
the
face
of
the
basis
of
the
statute.
secondly,
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
questioning
concerning
the
substantial
factor
test,
there
is
some
confusion.
