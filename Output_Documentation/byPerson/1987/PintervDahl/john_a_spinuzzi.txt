mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
have
a
delicate
problem
here
in
dealing
with
the
securities
laws.
congress
set
them
up,
and
this
court
has
interpreted
them,
and
now
we
are
juggling
with
those
laws
and
taking
them
out
of
balance
again.
and
the
premise
on
which
we
are
trying
to
take
these
delicate
mechanisms
out
of
balance
is
that
this
court
made
a
ruling
in
the
bateman
eichler
case
that
under
certain
circumstances
that
the
defense
of
in
pari
delicto
may
be
asserted
in
a
10(b)(5)
fraud
case.
it
is
sought
here
to
extend
that
beyond
the
fraud
activity
to
an
unregistered
security
activity.
frankly,
my
first
impression
was
similar,
that
on
a
strict
liability
statute
that
you
could
never
bring
in
pari
delicto.
i
do
not
agree
with
that
now,
because
equitably
it
has
always
been
permitted
in
not
only
fraudulent
conduct
but
also
in
illegal
conduct.
and
if
there
is
a
illegal
act
in
selling
unregistered
securities,
then
i
agree
with
the
sec
that
in
pari
delicto
should
be
applicable.
however,
it
is
a
rare
exception,
as
stated
by
this
court,
that
you
will
permit
that
defense,
because
the
normal
and
general
rule
is
that
it
will
not
be
permitted.
now
we
have
a
special
problem
here.
section
12(1)
specifically
says
that
the
seller
will
be
liable
to
his
purchaser
for
selling
unregistered
securities.
there
is
no
defense
to
that
statement.
it
is
absolute
liability.
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
pinter
was
the
seller
of
securities,
and
he
admitted
it.
and
the
court
found
that
they
were
not
registered,
and
the
court
found
him
liable
not
only
to
mr.
dahl
but
to
mr.
dahl's
friends
and
associates
who
also
invested.
the
critical
nature
of
this
problem
is
can
an
illegal
seller
of
unregistered
securities
avoid
his
liability
by
raising
a
theory
that
one
of
the
buyers
indirectly
or
directly
assisted
him
in
bringing
other
investors
into
the
ventures.
to
me,
that
is
a
critical
question.
it
is
not
quite
a
tippee-tipper
situation.
as
the
fifth
circuit
stated,
it
was
a
gregarious
act
intended
to
benefit
his
friends.
i
am
talking
about
mr.
dahl's
friends.
and
to
show
how
he
tried
to
benefit,
it
is
critical
for
this
court
to
be
aware
that
mr.
dahl
invested
a
total
of
$351,000
roughly
in
three
different
ventures.
his
ten
or
eleven
friends
that
he
brought
in
invested
a
total
of
$82,000
in
two
ventures.
and
more
importantly,
the
other
plaintiffs...
we
will
call
them
the
california
investors,
because
that
is
essentially
what
they
are
except
for
one
person
who
was
mr.
dahl's
fiancee...
the
california
investors
invested
in
two
wells,
and
those
wells
and
leases
had
already
been
fractionated
by
mr.
pinter
months
and
months
before.
he
had
already
drilled
two
wells
on
one
lease
with
other
investors,
and
he
had
already
drilled
one
well
on
another
lease
with
other
investors.
he
was
trying
to
drill
two
more
wells,
and
we
call
them
the
doss
3-b
and
the
doss
2-c
well.
he
had
some
of
his
investors
drop
out.
when
they
dropped
out,
he
approached
mr.
dahl.
and
he
said,
mr.
dahl,
some
of
my
investors
have
fallen
out,
and
i
have
got
room
for
some
more.
dahl
said
fine,
i
have
some
close
friends
who
probably
will
be
interested,
let
me
check,
and
he
did.
in
the
doss
3-b,
there
were
three
investors
from
these
plaintiffs.
one
was
mr.
dahl
himself,
one
was
his
fiancee,
and
one
was
his
cpa.
those
three
investors
invested
little.
the
cpa
invested
$7400,
and
his
fiancee
invested
$3500,
and
mr.
dahl
invested
about
$28,000.
but
the
remainder,
the
several
hundred
thousand
dollars
that
was
raised,
was
raised
by
people
unknown
to
mr.
dahl.
and
mr.
pinter,
he
raised
that
capital.
so
the
act
of
selling
unregistered
securities
was
already
in
process
by
mr.
pinter,
and
all
he
did
was
get
mr.
dahl
to
help
fill
in
the
void
for
the
last
three
interests.
as
to
the
antwine
2-c,
the
same
basic
idea
except
a
total
of
nine
of
mr.
dahl's
friends
invested
approximately
$7500
in
those
wells,
and
the
remainder
of
the
funds
were
raised
by
other
investors
by
mr.
pinter
in
his
other
efforts.
now
the
record
shows
that
mr.
pinter--
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
--it
made
no
finding
whatsoever
on
that.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
yes,
sir,
it
did.
and
that
substantial
factor
came
up
under
the
idea
of
how
do
you
determine
who
and
what
is
a
seller.
the
statute
does
not
define
a
seller.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
no,
i
am
not
challenging
the
court
of
appeals,
but
i
am
challenging
their
precedent,
yes.
because
the
majority
refused
to
follow
that
precedent.
they
added
the
other
financial
benefit
test
as
a
threshold
requirement.
and
frankly,
i
think
rightly
so,
either
that
one
or
some
other.
and
let
me
explain
why,
sir.
we
already
have
a
complicated
securities
law.
we
now
in
a
strict
liability
section
statute
where
there
is
no
defense,
section
12(1),
we
suddenly
throw
in
tort
negligence
law.
and
we
not
only
throw
in
tort
negligence
law,
but
we
throw
in
one
of
the
most
complicated
concepts
that
they
have
under
that
law.
that
is
proximate
cause,
legal
liability.
and
to
determine
proximate
cause,
they
now
say
you
must
be
a
substantial
factor.
and
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
what
some
of
the
authorities
thing
of
substantial
factor.
they
think
that
it
is
good
for
trying
to
determine
causation
and
fact.
but
it
has
no
bearing
and
it
has
no
relevance,
and
in
fact
is
a
hindrance
to
determining
actual
legal
liability.
that
is
a
policy
decision
of
this
court
and
of
congress.
it
is
not
a
decision
for
the
court
to
be
making
at
this
trial
level
saying
that
if
it
is
a
substantial
cause
or
substantial
factor
in
causing
it
that
then
he
is
liable.
it
is
sort
of
the
old
idea
of
but
for
you
introducing
me
to
him
that
i
never
would
have
met
him
and
i
never
would
have
sold
him,
and
therefore
you
are
the
substantial
cause
of
my
selling
him.
that
is
not
a
good
standard.
it
is
already
a
confusing
issue
in
tort
law,
and
here
we
are
going
to
try
to
make
it
more
confusing
in
the
securities
law.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
mr.
dahl
is
not
liable.
both
the
trial
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
found
that
he
was
not.
mr.
pinter
was,
because
he
was
the
issuer
of
the
securities.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
that
would
be
one.
because
by
being
the
actual
seller,
that
would
do
it.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
i
think
that
there
are
other
situations.
let
me
use
an
example.
if
mr.
dahl
knew
that
these
were
unregistered
securities,
which
he
did,
and
he
knew
that
there
was
a
private
offering
exemption
being
sought
to
be
proven
and
mr.
dahl
himself
knew
that
he
could
avoid
and
ruin
the
private
offering
exemption
by
his
own
wrongful
conduct,
then
i
think
that
he
could
be
liable.
a
person
who
wants
to
meet
the
private
offering
exemption
or
the
non-public
offering
exemption
as
it
is
technically
called
has
certain
restrictions.
section
4.2
is
the
exemption
provided
by
congress
to
say
all
right,
if
you
do
not
want
to
sell
registered
securities,
you
can
sell
unregistered
securities
on
condition
that
you
make
the
proper
disclosures.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
it
does
not
really
quite
say
that
either.
section
12
says,
"whoever
offers
or
sells
a
security
in
violation
of
section
5
shall
be
liable
to
his
purchaser.
"
the
seller
is
liable
to
the
purchaser,
but
it
does
not
say
whoever
violates
the
statute.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
it
does
not
say
that
specifically
in
the
statute,
no.
it
would
be
construed,
and
i
think
that
in
many
instances
that
it
can.
because
the
consummation
of
the
sale
appears
to
be
the
actual
damage
and
not
necessarily
just
the
offerer.
it
is
an
interesting
point.
because
at
one
time
the
statute
in
the
definition
included
sale
to
include
an
offer.
it
was
later
amended
about
1958
and
removed
that
provision.
but
logically
speaking,
a
person
who
really
actively
participates
in
a
sale,
and
i
think
that
a
pecuniary
benefit
test
is
applicable.
because
very
frankly,
in
the
trial
court,
the
defense
was
raised
that
mr.
dahl
agreed
to
sell
in
exchange
for
a
commission.
that
is
pecuniary
benefit.
it
was
disproved.
it
was
finally
admitted
by
mr.
pinter
that
he
was
wrong,
that
he
did
not
pay
a
commission
or
agree
to
pay
a
commission.
so
that
would
be
one
sense.
another
sense
would
be
the
way
that
the
sec
has
taken
the
position.
that
if
he
were
a
promoter
of
the
enterprise,
that
if
he
had
a
financial
interest
in
the
actual
business
himself,
that
would
be
different.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
where
the
purchaser
of
a
security
has
only
an
interest
in
a
venture
as
an
investor
himself
that
he
cannot
be
a
seller
to
someone
else
merely
by
saying,
hey,
i
have
got
a
good
deal,
i
have
checked
it
out
and
i
think
that
it
is
great,
you
ought
to
get
into
it.
and
that
is
basically
what
happened
here.
now
there
was
not
even
any
negotiation
by
mr.
dahl
with
these
other
people.
the
subscription
agreement
prepared
by
mr.
pinter
and
given
to
mr.
dahl
had
all
of
the
terms
and
the
conditions
of
the
sale.
the
only
thing
that
it
lacked
was
the
name
of
the
investor,
his
social
security
number,
and
his
address.
and
at
the
very
end,
it
has
a
form
of
schedule
which
says
that
if
you
buy
a
one-sixteenth
interest
that
it
costs
you
x
dollars
and
if
you
buy
three-sixty-fourths
that
it
costs
you
x
dollars,
and
all
you
do--
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
--yes,
sir,
it
really
was.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
understand
why
he
did,
these
were
all
people
that
he
had
known
for
some
time.
they
were
his
business
partners
and
his
banker.
he
used
to
be
in
the
construction
business.
his
banker,
his
insurance
man,
his
fiancee,
his
own
brother.
there
was
not
any
stranger
to
him
that
he
was
not
a
close
associate
with
that
he
did
not
say,
hey,
you
ought
to
be
in
on
this.
he
received
nothing,
but
perhaps
except
hopefully
the
friendship
was
increased.
i
do
not
know
what
else.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
you
may
be
right.
now
what
really
bothers
me
is
the
attempt
here
to
shift
the
burden
of
what
i
consider
to
the
statute's
main
function
of
the
disclose
of
all
material
information
in
connection
with
an
investment
opportunity.
mr.
pinter
says,
hey,
you
should
have
told
him
the
truth.
now
the
critical
thing
that
came
up
in
the
testimony
that
really
is
shocking
is
mr.
pinter
says
that
he
gave
nothing
to
mr.
dahl
to
explain
this
offering
or
the
three
offerings,
nothing.
he
gave
him
one
thing
as
a
kind
of
geological
report,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
particular
well.
he
just
said
that
it
was
to
give
him
an
idea
of
where
approximately
the
wells
were
located.
well,
that
does
not
even
meet,
of
course,
the
registration
requirements,
and
it
certainly
does
not
meet
the
exemption
requirements.
and
in
this
regard,
mr.
pinter
specifically
said
in
the
subscription
agreement
that
these
securities
are
not
registered
under
the
securities
act
of
1933.
but
then
it
goes
on,
146>
["].
and
rule
146
is
a
specific
sec
rule
providing
a
safe
haven
for
an
offering
which
is
exempt
from
registration
under
the
non-public
offering
exemption
of
section
4(2).
now
if
you
are
going
to
put
the
burden
on
mr.
dahl
and
say
equitably
he
is
estopped
and
he
is
in
pari
delicto
because
he
knew
that
the
securities
were
unregistered,
then
so
did
everyone
else
who
invested
in
those
wells,
because
they
all
signed
the
subscription
agreement
and
the
subscription
agreement
is
very
specific
that
these
are
not
registered.
but
if
you
are
going
to
charge
him
with
that
burden,
then
we
should
always
charge
him
with
the
other
burden
it
says,
146>
["],
meaning
that
mr.
pinter
must
have
complied
with
rule
146.
but
the
testimony
was
just
the
opposite.
and
this
was
interesting.
mr.
dahl
received
a
financial
statement.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
i
disagree
for
this
reason.
the
scheme,
as
you
call
it,
had
already
been
laid,
and
in
existence,
and
in
operation.
this
is
basically
what
the
sec
wants
to
find
out,
was
dahl
personally
involved
in
the
scheme
as
a
promoter.
it
was
already
in
operation.
they
were
selling
the
interests
to
other
people.
he
only
needed
a
few
more
people
to
fill
out
and
finalize
his
subscriptions.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
no,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
no,
sir.
if
that
person
comes
in
as
an
agent
for
the
seller,
and
i
am
talking
about
the
issuer
as
a
seller,
he
should
be
liable
also.
but
that
is
basically
held
by
the
courts
anyway.
or
if
he
is
the
agent
selling
on
behalf
of
the
issuer.
there
is
another
one
that
goes
that
if
he
is
in
a
control
relationship
with
the
issuer,
section
15
i
believe
it
is.
there
is
a
specific
liability
which
they
can
take
up.
why
do
we
have
to
go
to
in
pari
delicto?
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
he
is
not.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
in
that
case,
i
would
say
that
he
is
going
to
come
under
the
three
categories
of
either
an
issuer,
or
an
underwriter,
or
a
dealer
in
securities.
those
definitions
are
broad
enough
to
catch
a
person
in
that
position.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
exemptions
from
registration
specifically
says
if
you
are
not
an
issuer,
and
if
you
are
an
underwriter,
and
if
you
are
not
a
dealer,
than
you
may
sell
the
security.
now
normally,
that
is
a
secondary
trading
type
exemption,
but
it
could
also
count
for
a
normal
issue.
so
in
those
three
categories,
i
think
that
it
would
almost
always
lump
them
in.
and
interestingly
enough,
that
came
up
after
the
trial
in
a
proposed
finding
of
fact,
but
it
was
two
weeks
after
the
trial.
and
it
was
not
ruled
on
by
the
court,
and
i
can
understand.
and
there
is
something
else
about
the
trial
court.
i
have
put
in
my
brief
that
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
these
issues
are
not
even
properly
before
this
court.
we
do
not
think
that
the
in
pari
delicto
defense,
or
the
estoppel
defense,
or
the
right
of
contribution
were
ever
raised
in
the
trial
court
in
the
form
in
which
they
are
brought
here.
and
the
form
in
which
they
are
brought
here
is
with
reference
to
the
sale
of
unregistered
securities.
the
manner
in
which
it
was
raised
in
the
trial
court
was
under
a
10(b)(5)
fraud
theory.
well,
excuse
me,
i
will
take
it
back.
it
was
under
a
common
law
fraud
theory.
that
mr.
dahl
made
material
misrepresentations
and
omissions
of
fact
that
caused
mr.
pinter
to
engage
in
this
wrongful
conduct.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
the
fifth
circuit
apparently
decided
that
it
was
of
significant
enough
importance
that
they
would
go
ahead
and
rule
on
it.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
and
estoppel.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
estoppel
was
the
main
point
of
judge
hill.
judge
hill
kept
saying...
estoppel,
of
course,
here
was
he
knew
or
did
not
know
that
securities
were
unregistered.
judge
hill
said
so
what,
the
old
case
from
the
fifth
circuit,
henderson
v.
hayden,
that
they
have
always
applied
the
standard
that
you
cannot
waive
your
rights
under
the
statute
and
you
cannot
be
estopped
from
your
rights
under
the
statute
even
if
you
have
knowledge
that
they
are
unregistered.
because
in
this
instance,
the
great
white
father,
congress,
says
we
are
going
to
protect
you,
public,
from
your
own
ignorance
unless
the
issuer
gives
you
a
complete
disclosure
of
all
material
information.
if
he
gives
you
disclosure,
then
mr.
investor,
it
is
your
tough
luck,
you
take
care
of
yourself.
and
that
is
the
way
that
it
has
been,
and
really
the
way
that
it
should
be,
because
the
law
imparts
the
fairness
of
disclosing
the
investment
opportunity.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
i
think
that
they
are
trying
to...
well,
the
sec
has
policy
decisions
too,
and
i
agree.
and
their
policy
decision
here
is
that
they
would
like
to
enlarge
it
to
cover
a
promoter
in
that
sense,
and
i
cannot
disagree.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
yes.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
i
agree.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
reason
that
they
did
not
focus.
the
reason
is
that
it
was
never
made
an
issue
in
the
trial
court.
but
more
importantly,
even
if
it
had
been,
the
record
in
the
trial
court
shows
absolutely
no
evidence
to
support
such
a
theory.
so
assuming
a
remand
as
an
example,
there
is
nothing
there
in
the
record
for
the
court
to
make
a
ruling
on.
there
is
nothing,
absolutely
zero,
to
indicate
the
mr.
dahl
was
a
promoter
of
this,
evidentiary-wise
or
otherwise.
that
would
mean
then
that
we
start
a
trial
all
over
again
on
issues
that
in
my
opinion
were
never
raised.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
no.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
i
think
that
it
would.
you
see,
i
am
afraid
to
say.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
eichler
was
basically
talked
on
the
1934
act
which
was
a
10(b)(5)
fraud
action,
and
we
are
not
talking
about
fraud
here.
i
can
understand
the
exception
that
this
court
made
in
the
eichler
case,
and
it
makes
good
sense.
but
in
that
case,
even
the
court
here
did
not
permit
the
in
pari
delicto
defense
to
be
used.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
i
do
not
think
that
we
need
any
more.
you
see,
the
wrongful
conduct
that
they
are
claiming
with
mr.
dahl
is
that
he
was
also
a
seller
to
his
friends
by
giving
them
a
tip.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
i
do
disagree
with
the
sec
on
that
part.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
in
pari
delicto
was
never
permissible
in
a
section
12(1)
strict
liability
situation.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
yes,
sir,
it
did.
and
the
reason
that
it
did
is
that
it
said
that
dahl
was
a
buyer
of
all
of
these
securities,
and
as
a
buyer
you
are
talking
about
so-called
seller
activity
which
is
a
matter
not
related
to
his
own
purchases.
that
is
basically
what
the
court
said.
that
if
you
are
going
to
use
the
equitable
defense
of
in
pari
delicto,
it
must
relate
to
the
same
identical
matter
of
which
you
complain.
mr.
dahl
was
not
complaining
about
the
wrongful
sales
to
his
friends.
he
was
complaining
about
the
wrongful
sales
to
him.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
i
agree.
and
the
only
thing
that
i
can
figure
is
that
he
is
going
back
to
the
historical
call
it
transition
of
the
equitable
doctrine.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
they
have
a
slightly
different
wording,
sir,
and
if
i
may
read
my
note
here
on
it.
under
the
eichler
case
it
says,
"preclusion
of
a
suit
would
not
significantly
interfere
with
effective
enforcement
or
protection
of
the
public.
"
the
henderson
standards
says,
"it
would
further
the
goals
of
securities.
"
to
me,
they
are
basically
the
same,
but
they
are
slightly
different
wording.
and
apparently,
judge
brown
in
his
dissent
put
some
emphasis
on
that
difference.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
a.
spinuzzi
in
my
opinion,
yes.
the
wording
is
slightly
different,
but
i
see
nothing
different
whatsoever
in
substance.
and
in
addition,
the
henderson
case
was
really
primarily
directed
in
its
application
by
the
fifth
circuit
at
the
estoppel
theory,
that
his
knowledge
that
the
securities
were
unregistered.
the
court
said
that
in
its
opinion
that
the
eichler
case
still
applies
to
the
estoppel
theory
as
to
knowledge
of
unregistered
securities.
but
that
in
any
event,
in
the
majority's
view,
that
even
if
you
applied
the
eichler
standard
that
it
still
would
not
bar
or
preclude
recovery
by
mr.
dahl.
i
have
nothing
further,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much,
justices.
