mr.
richard
g.
taranto
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
the
in
pari
delicto
question
in
this
case,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
thinks
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
to
the
extent
that
it
ruled
that
the
in
pari
delicto
defense
is
never
available
in
an
action
brought
under
section
12(1).
as
i
propose
to
explain
in
more
detail
in
a
moment,
and
i
want
to
present
our
views
in
a
manner
slightly
different
from
our
presentation
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
the
in
pari
delicto
should
be
available
in
certain
narrowly
defined
circumstances.
on
the
second
question
in
the
case,
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
ruling
that
a
person
who
solicits
a
securities
purchase
may
be
liable
under
section
12(1)
along
with
the
person
who
passed
title,
but
only
is
the
solicitor
had
some
motivation
in
promoting
the
purchase
other
than
a
friendly
desire
to
further
the
interests
of
the
buyer.
because
only
then
can
he
fairly
be
aligned
on
the
selling
side
of
the
transaction.
we
do
not
take
a
position
in
this
case
on
whether
contribution
may
be
available
in
a
section
12
action.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
not
when
the
issuer
is
actually
the
person
passing
title
to
the
security.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
the
financial
interest
test
does
not
go
to
the
in
pari
delicto
defense,
but
it
goes
only
to
whether
a
person
other
than
the
person
passing
title
can
also
be
a
seller,
and
therefore
conceivably
liable
to
the
other
people
that
he
solicits.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
we
think
that
section
12
is
firmly
rooted
in
the
common
law
remedy
of
rescission
where
financial
interest
does
not
play
a
role
as
to
the
person
who
passes
title.
the
history
of
the
development
of
section
12,
and
its
amendment
in
1954,
and
its
judicial
history
prior
to
that
seems
to
us
to
make
it
clear
that
liability
can
extend
somewhat
beyond
the
person
who
owned
the
security
before
the
sale.
the
question
then
is
what
kind
of
limits
have
to
be
placed
on
the
extension
of
liability
beyond
the
person
who
passed
title.
solicitation,
we
think,
is
part
of
the
statute,
but
there
is
an
important
distinction
which
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
rightly
captured
between
somebody
who
simply
urges
somebody
else
to
get
in
on
a
good
deal
and
on
the
other
hand
somebody
who
because
of
his
own
interests
is
properly
aligned
on
the
selling
side
of
the
transaction.
we
do
not
think
that
financial
benefit
is
a...
we
do
not
mean
by
that
something
terribly
precise
or
limited
in
that
indirect
financial
interests
can
align
the
individual
on
the
selling
side
of
the
transaction
just
as
a
commission
can.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
always
two
people,
one
person
on
each
of
the
two
sides
of
a
sale,
the
person
who
passed
title
and
the
person
who
then
owns
the
security
after
that
transaction.
and
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
establish
some
limits
on
the
extension
of
the
seller
class
beyond
the
person
who
is
unquestionably
in
that
class,
namely
the
person
who
passed
title.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
if
you
are
an
agent
for
the
seller,
there
is
very
likely
to
be
some
kind
of
interest
of
your
own,
presumably
a
continuing
relationship
with
the
seller,
if
you
are
carrying
on
the
activities
for
the
seller.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
sounds
to
me
as
though...
i
am
somewhat
confused
by
who
exactly
is
passing
title
in
the
course
of
that
transaction.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
that
anybody
who
is
the
holder
of
title
before--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--is
a
seller,
that
is
right.
let
me
try
to--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--oh,
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that
is
right.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
the
underlying
legal
question
whether
contribution
can
ever
be
available
in
section
12.
it
found
it
unnecessary
to
do
that,
because
it
thought
contribution
should
not
be
available
in
this
case
even
if
it
could
be
available
in
some
other
section
12
case.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
we
do.
we
think
that
the
district
court
did
note
that
dahl
did
not
receive
any
commissions,
but
did
not
address
whether
there
was
some
indirect
financial
interest.
in
particular,
whether
dahl
would
have
needed
these
particular
purchases
in
order
to
make
his
investment
profitable,
and
whether
there
were
other
potential
purchasers
who
might
have
taken
the
place
of
these.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
we
do.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
issue
has
not
been
briefed.
and
if
on
remanding
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
were
to
address
the
contribution
question
and
decide
that
contribution
could
not
be
available
under
section
12
regardless
of
the
particular
financial
interest
or
its
absence,
that
issue
would
not
have
to
be
addressed.
but
the
question
of
whether
section
12
in
any
circumstance
permits
contribution
has
not
been
presented
or
briefed
in
this
case.
so
that
issue
would
have
to
be
decided
on
a
remand.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
difference
i
think
is
really
one
of
emphasis.
to
the
extent
that
we
suggested
in
the
brief
that
the
first
part
of
our
test
for
the
in
pari
delicto
defense
was
that
the
buyer
had
to
be
more
a
promoter
than
an
investor,
the
main
thing
that
i
wanted
to
do
was
to
dispel
any
misimpression
that
what
we
meant
by
that
was
a
simple
comparison,
how
much
did
the
buyer
solicit
and
how
much
did
he
purchase,
and
that
that
would
somehow
automatically
answer
the
question.
by
promoter,
we
mean
something
broader
than
that.
we
mean
simply
what
role
did
this
buyer
play
in
the
offering
as
a
whole.
to
be
a
promoter,
he
might
have
played
an
active
role
in
any
number
of
respects,
not
just
soliciting
purchases.
he
might
have
prepared
offering
material,
and
he
might
have
been
the
instigator.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that
is
right.
what
we
mean
by
the
promoter
part
of
the
test
is
something
that
focuses
on
the
buyer's
role
and
the
offer
as
a
whole,
and
we
then
move
on.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
we
think
that
that
could
be
evidence
of--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--direct
evidence
of
a
promoter
role.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
that
without
factual
findings
by
the
district
court
made
in
the
light
of
a
broad
enough
understanding
of
what
kinds
of
financial
interests
can
qualify
for
this
test
to
align
him
on
the
selling
side
of
the
transaction
that
further
findings
should
be
made.
in
particular,
there
seems
to
be
some
disagreement
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
about
certain
kinds
of
indirect
financial
interests
and
whether
they
would
quality.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
we
read
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
said
that
because
12(1)
is
a
strict
liability
statute
that
the
in
pari
delicto
is
never
available.
