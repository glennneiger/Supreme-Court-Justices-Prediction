justice
white
that
is
because
he
is
a
seller?
justice
white
you
claim
that
he
is
a
seller,
and
therefore
a
joint
tort
feasor
with
pinter?
justice
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
your
claim
that
he
was
a
seller?
justice
white
and
both
issues
are
here?
justice
white
but
what?
justice
white
even
if
you
are
an
agent
of
somebody
else?
justice
white
supposing
the
person
holding
title
is
an
agent
of
someone
else
just
for
the
purpose
of
holding
title,
and
he
passes
it
when
he
is
told
to
by
his
principal?
justice
white
whoever
is
holding
title
passes
title,
and
supposing
that
the
person
holding
title
is
an
agent
for
that
purpose
for
somebody
else?
justice
white
mr.
taranto,
i
do
take
it
that
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
standard
to
be
applied
in
determining
the
in
pari
delicto
defense?
justice
white
and
estoppel?
justice
white
i
do
not
think
that
you
accept
the
sec's
definition
of
the
in
pari
delicto
defense.
justice
white
do
you
think
that
it
requires
dahl
to
be
a
promoter?
justice
white
well,
that
is
something
different
than
what
we
said
in
the
eichler
case.
justice
white
that
is
an
additional
element
that
is
not
present
in
eichler.
justice
white
but
eichler
referred
to
another
section,
is
that
it?
justice
white
exactly.
why
do
you
need
any
more
in
this
case?
justice
white
if
we
say
that
the
in
pari
delicto
defense
is
available
in
some
circumstances
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals,
must
we
not
remand
and
say,
look,
here
is
the
right
rule,
now
decide
whether
it
is
available
on
the
facts.
if
there
are
not
enough
facts,
maybe
you
have
to
send
it
back
to
the
trial
court.
justice
white
well,
it
said
that
it
was
not
available
here.
justice
white
absent
a
showing
a
dahl's
conduct
was
offensive
to
the
dictates
of
natural
justice,
the
unclean
hands,
the
in
pari
delicto
unclean
hands
are
not
available.
justice
white
but
did
not
the
court
of
appeals
hold
in
discussing
estoppel
that
to
allow
the
estoppel
defense
would
frustrate
the
purposes
of
the
act?
justice
white
and
that
is
one
of
the
requirements
also
of
in
pari
delicto
indirectly,
is
that
not
right?
justice
white
yes.
but
the
opinion
says
that
it
would
frustrate
the
purposes
of
the
securities
act.
justice
white
is
that
not
eichler,
too?
