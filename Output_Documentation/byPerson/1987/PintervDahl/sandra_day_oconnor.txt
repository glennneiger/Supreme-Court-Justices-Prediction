justice
o'connor
of
course,
mr.
sparks,
i
thought
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
determined
that
mr.
dahl
lacked
any
sort
of
pecuniary
gain
motivation.
justice
o'connor
do
you
also
think,
mr.
taranto,
that
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
make
the
necessary
determination
about
the
pecuniary
interests
that
dahl
might
have
had?
justice
o'connor
so
you
think
that
we
need
to
remand
on
that?
justice
o'connor
and
that
means
that
we
have
to
also
address
the
merits
of
the
contribution
issue?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
spinuzzi,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
that
approach
that
it
would
further
congress'
objectives
to
provide
a
in
pari
delicto
defense
to
someone
who
is
a
promoter
and
who
gets
other
people
to
buy
these
unregistered
securities
as
a
promoter,
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
sec
is
arguing.
justice
o'connor
and
it
would
seem
to
further
congress'
purposes
here?
justice
o'connor
so
the
question
is
whether
mr.
dahl
is
indeed
a
promoter
in
that
sense.
justice
o'connor
and
perhaps
the
courts
below
did
not
have
a
chance
to
focus
on
that,
because
at
least
the
first
circuit
thought
that
defense
was
not
available
at
all.
