justice
scalia
mr.
taranto,
suppose
the
primary
defendant
here,
suppose
mr.
pinter,
were
a
philanthropist,
and
it
were
shown
that
he
really
did
not
expect
to
make
any
profit
from
this
stock,
but
just
to
benefit
his
friends
and
associates
that
he
was
selling
their
interests
in
the
wells,
would
that
be
enough
to
exempt
him
from
liability
under
12(1)?
justice
scalia
no,
but
he
comes
under
the
same
language.
i
mean
he
sells
or
offers.
why
should
that
be
a
necessity
for
the
in
pari
delicto
but
not
a
necessity
for
the
substantive
liability
in
the
first
place?
justice
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
that
is
the
first
step
to
establishing
the
in
pari
delicto
defense.
why
should
it
be
that
the
issuer
need
not
have
that
kind
of
motivation,
but
that
someone
else
in
order
to
be
liable
must?
justice
scalia
but
that
it
not
necessary,
you
say,
to
align
pinter
on
the
selling
side?
justice
scalia
that
is
the
key
then.
if
you
have
title
and
pass
it,
it
does
not
matter
whether
your
motivation
is
beneficent
or
proper.
whereas
if
you
did
not
pass
title
and
you
are
looking
only
at
someone
who
participated
in
the
offering
somehow,
you
need
the
motivation.
justice
scalia
you
mean
on
the
whole
and
not
necessarily
to
these
particular
plaintiffs?
justice
scalia
but
you
would
not
say
in
the
colloquy
that
was
going
between
counsel
and
justice
stevens
that
the
offering
to
someone
who
was
not
one
of
the
plaintiffs
here
is
merely
confirmatory
or
circumstantial
evidence
of
the
necessary
qualification?
justice
scalia
direct
evidence.
justice
scalia
may
i
ask
one
more
question.
if
i
agree
with
you
that
this
matter
was
not
found,
that
is
the
financial
motivation
by
the
district
court,
but
i
think
that
it
was
found
by
the
court
of
appeals,
would
we
still
have
to
remand?
your
brief
says
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
it
either,
and
i
happen
to
disagree
with
that.
what
if
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
find
no
financial
motivation,
but
the
district
court
did
not?
justice
scalia
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
find
on
this
point?
justice
scalia
did
not
its
opinion
assume,
it
seems
to
me,
did
it
not
appear
to
assume
that
he
was
a
substantial
factor?
justice
scalia
i
understand
that.
so
you
are
challenging
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
scalia
i
do
not
understand
what
you
are
saying.
are
you
saying
that
he
is
liable
even
if
he
is
not
a
substantial
factor,
or
that
even
if
he
is
a
substantial
factor
that
he
is
not
liable?
justice
scalia
what
would
make
dahl
liable
in
your
view,
does
he
have
to
be
the
actual
seller
who
transfers
title?
justice
scalia
i
am
sure
that
would,
but
what
else?
justice
scalia
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
the
language,
offers
or
sells,
that
the
word
offers
brings
in
beyond
the
transfer
of
title?
justice
scalia
and
the
offerer
is
liable
to
nobody?
justice
scalia
but
the
others
are
not
responsible
for
its
having
failed
to
be
a
private
offering,
and
the
contention
here
is
that
dahl
is
in
part,
because
he
was
one
of
those
who
promoted
the
entire
scheme,
whether
he
did
it
for
purposes
of
friendship
or
for
purposes
of
profit.
justice
scalia
so
you
say
if
someone
else
has
already
approached
enough
other
people
that
the
private
offering
exemption
is
lost,
has
already
been
lost,
then
someone
who
comes
in
at
that
stage
and
assists
in
selling
to
even
more
of
the
public,
he
is
okay,
because
after
all
the
violation
has
occurred?
justice
scalia
is
that
your
theory?
justice
scalia
but
not
if
he
is
doing
it
for
his
own
financial
gain.
justice
scalia
but
what
if
he
is
doing
it
for
his
own
financial
gain?
