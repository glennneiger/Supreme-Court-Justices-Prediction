mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
raises
the
issue
of
when
a
reviewing
court
can
compel
the
immigration
authorities
to
reopen
a
deportation
proceeding
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
after
the
alien
has
already
been
given
a
hearing
and
after
an
order
of
deportation
has
been
entered.
the
context
in
which
the
issue
arises
is
as
follows.
respondent
has
been
here
illegally
for
almost
12
years,
since
1976.
his
deportation
hearing
was
held
in
1982,
and
involved
five
appearances
before
the
immigration
judge
between
1981
and
1982.
respondent,
who
was
represented
by
competent
counsel
at
the
hearing,
declined
to
seek
asylum
despite
specific
questioning
by
the
immigration
judge
on
the
issue.
in
1985,
respondent
filed
a
motion
to
reopen
to
apply
for
asylum
and
withholding
of
deportation
based
on
an
event
that
occurred
in
1984,
namely,
a
visit
to
respondent
by
a
ghanian
official
who
was
also
respondent's
personal
friend,
and
i
will
have
more
to
say
about
this
event
later
in
the
argument.
the
issue
of
the
extent
of
deference
in
the
context
of
a
motion
to
reopen
has
been
addressed
by
this
court
three
times
in
the
immigration
context,
in
jong
ha
wang,
in
rios-pineda,
and
in
phinpathya.
these
cases
emphasize
the
great
deference
that
must
be
given
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
its
decision
not
to
reopen.
the
court
has
emphasized
the
importance
of
finality
and
has
pointed
out
that
in
this
context
reopening
is
not
required
by
statute
but
is
purely
a
product
of
regulation,
and
in
fact
the
regulation
itself
does
not
mandate
reopening
in
any
particular
circumstance,
but
rather,
as
the
court
noted,
is
framed
in
the
negative.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
correct.
it
is
purely
a
matter
of
regulation.
and
this
court
has
made
that
clear
in
jong
ha
wang
in
its
discussion.
notwithstanding
this
court's
decision,
the
ninth
circuit
held,
contrary
to
the
bia,
that
respondent
had
alleged
a
prima
facie
case
of
eligibility
for
asylum,
and
that
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
therefore
required.
as
a
result
of
the
ninth
circuit's
holding,
the
entire
process
will
begin
anew,
including
possible
appeals,
even
though
the
deportation
hearing
was
held
more
than
five
years
ago,
and
even
though
the
only
fact
that
was
offered
by
respondent
in
support
of
his
motion
to
reopen
is
one
that
even
the
ninth
circuit
itself
said
could
be
viewed
as
ambiguous
or
benign.
now,
if
i
could
just
elaborate
briefly
on
some
of
the
facts
that
are
critical
to
this
case,
as
i
said,
respondent
entered
the
united
states
originally
in
1965,
approximately
ten
years
ago.
he
left
briefly
during
the
summer
of
1973,
and
the
returned
on
a
visa
that
was
good
until
1976.
in
1981,
while
respondent
was
here
illegally,
he
pleaded
guilty
to
three
narcotics
offenses,
and
based
on
his
plea
of
guilty
to
those
offenses,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
instituted
deportation
proceedings
and
those
proceedings
in
fact
resulted
in
hearings
that
occurred
between
november
and
july,
november,
1981,
and
july,
1982.
there
were
five
separate
appearances.
the
continuances
on
each
occasion
being
at
respondent's
request.
one
of
the
continuances
in
the
case,
from
november
10th,
1981,
to
january
11th,
1982,
appears
to
have
been
requested
in
part
so
that
respondent
could
prepare
an
application
for
asylum
and
withholding
of
deportation,
and
in
fact
respondent's
counsel
specifically
represented
to
the
immigration
judge
that
such
an
application
would
be
filed.
respondent
ultimately
chose
not
to
seek
asylum
or
withholding
of
deportation,
and
he
was
consequently
found
deportable
in
july,
1982,
and
that
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
bia
in
1984.
in
february,
1985,
while
that
appeal
was
pending
in
the
ninth
circuit,
respondent
filed
a
motion
to
reopen
with
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
as
respondent
concedes,
the
only
new
fact
that
relates
to
the
respondent
other
than
just
the
general
events
in
ghana
was
this
visit
from
the
ghanian
official,
and
it
is
significant
to
note
that
although
this
visit
occurred
in
the
spring
of
1984,
respondent
waited
almost
an
entire
year
until
february,
1985,
before
seeking
reopening.
there
is
no
dispute
that
this
individual
who
made
the
visit
is
someone
who
respondent
had
known
for
many
years.
the
additional
fact
which--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--it
probably
was
not.
since
the
deportation
hearing
occurred
in
1982,
and
since
the
visit
did
not
occur
until
1984,
this
was
new
evidence.
we
have
a
serious
dispute
with
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion
that
it
was
material
evidence.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
exactly
correct.
the
old
facts
which
were
in
existence
at
the
time
respondent
chose
not
to
play
or
as
you
in
essentially
involved
allegations
involving
his
brother
and
other
close
associates
in
terms
of
their
associations
with
prior
regimes
in
ghana
and
the
fact
that
those
individuals
may
well
be
in
danger.
it
is
important
to
note,
as
the
bia
pointed
out
in
its
opinion,
that
respondent
doesn't
explain
how
the
risk
to
those
individuals
would
necessarily
translate
into
a
risk
to
respondent.
respondent
now
concedes--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
don't
think
so.
we
are
not
sure
what
import
ought
to
be--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
we
don't
think
that
is
obvious,
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
the
reason--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--oh,
but
it...
certainly
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
motion
to
reopen
that
his
man
came
forth
sole
purpose
of
visiting
respondent,
and
in
fact
he
didn't
even
know
where
to
locate
respondent,
and
had
had
to
contact
respondent
through
his
brother.
the
more
reasonable
inference
is
that
he
was
here
for
another
purpose,
perhaps
an
official
government
purpose,
and
decide
to
contact
the
respondent.
that
is
one
of
the
ambiguities,
in
fact,
in
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
we
don't
know
if
they
are
trying
to
kill
his
whole
family.
all
we
know--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--there
was
no
testimony...
the
only
reference
to
the
brother
were
very
brief
statements
in
the
motion
to
reopen,
a
one-line
sentence
indicating
that
the
brother's
house
had
previously
been
surrounded,
and
then
a
vague
allegation
that
the
brother
had
made
his
way
out
of
ghana,
but
let
me
respond--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--according
to
the
conclusory
allegation,
with
no
explanation
as
to
why,
but
let
me
respond,
justice
marshall,
to
your--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
don't
think
so.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
we
don't
think
so.
we
think
that
the
purpose
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
not
to
give
the
alien
an
opportunity
to
flesh
out
the
motion
to
reopen.
it
is
not
a
preview
of
things
to
come.
we
think
that
the
purpose
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
to
see
if
respondent
can
prove
the
facts
that
he
alleges
in
the
motion
to
reopen.
and
let
me
give
you
an
example
in
the
criminal
context,
in
the
context
of
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
grounds
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
every
court
would
agree
that
it
is
inadequate
for
a
defendant
to
come
in
after
trial
and
say,
i
have
found
a
new
witness
who
is
going
to
exonerate
me.
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
all
the
details
now,
but
if
you
give
me
a
new
trial
and
vacate
my
conviction,
we
will
tell
you
all
about
it.
that
is
simply
not
the
proper
way
to
go
about
it.
the
case
law
was
clear
at
the
time
in
every
circuit
that
respondent
needed
to
lay
out
in
detail
exactly
what
his
theory
was
or
he
would
risk
denial
of
the
motion
to
reopen
on
the
ground
that
it
was
conclusory,
but
let
me,
justice
marshall,
get
back
to
your
original
question,
because
there
is
a
very
important
reason
why
this
individual
may
have
wanted
the
respondent
to
return
to
ghana,
and
that
is
because
he
was
a
medical
doctor
who
was
trained
in
the
united
states,
was
highly
educated,
and
in
fact
respondent's
own
evidence
in
the
motion
to
reopen
indicates
that
the
prior
ghanian
regimes
had
also
tried
very,
very
hard
to
get
respondent
back.
he
was
highly
sought
after
regardless
of
the
regime
in
power,
and
we
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
that
can
be
viewed--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
we
don't
know.
apparently
not,
because
the
visitor
didn't
know
where
he
was--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
we
think
that,
as
i
said,
this
is
a
situation,
you
have
a
developing
country.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
admitted.
that's
correct.
and
consequently
it
is
the
kind
of
fact
that
cries
out
for
additional
facts
before
an
individual
would
have
a
well
founded
fear.
certainly
at
least
given
the
ambiguity
of
the
fact,
given
the
colloquy
that
we
have
had
right
now,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
this
is
simply
not
enough
for
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
reopening
a
deportation
proceeding
five
years
later
in
a
situation
in
which
the
individual
has
already
been
found
deportable,
has
already
had
a
full
opportunity
to
assert
his
claim
for
asylum
and
chose
not
to
do
so.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
its
holding
held,
number
one,
that
respondent
did
not
adequately
explain
his
failure
to
apply
for
asylum
and
withholding
during
the
deportation
hearing
and
that
consequently
he
failed
to
comply
with
the
regulatory
requirements.
8
cfr
208.11
specifically
requires
that
an
alien
give
an
adequate
explanation.
secondly,
the
board
held
that
the
new
fact
as
alleged
by
respondent
was
ambiguous,
just
as
we
have
recognized
here
today.
it
could
be
viewed
as
benign
but
it
could
be
viewed
as
threatening.
and
when
you
have
a
fact
like
that
that
could
be
viewed
so
many
different
ways,
it
is
not
the
kind
of
fact
that
would
compel
the
immigration
authorities
to
reopen
for
a
deportation
hearing.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
we
don't
think
it
is.
as
i
said,
and
again,
this
is
just
to
dovetail
the
question
that
was
asked
by
justice
marshall,
we
agree
with
the
definition
of
prima
facie
case
given
by
the
ninth
circuit
on
page
7a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix
that
it
is
a
case
in
which...
where
the
affidavits
on
other
evidentiary
material,
if
true,
would
satisfy
the
requirements
for
substantive
relief,
so
we
don't
view
a
prima
facie
case
as
being
enough
to
show
that
a
hearing
might
be
useful.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
we
don't
think
it
is.
we
think
that
what
a
prima
facie
case
means
is
that
if
he
came
in
and
proved
everything
that
he
alleged,
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
relief,
or
at
least
would
have
established
eligibility
for
the
relief.
and
again,
that
is
now
the
ninth
circuit
itself
uses
prima
facie
case.
we
don't
think...
if
it
were
true
that
a
prima
face
case
was
somehow
less,
that
only
required
you
to
somehow
get
in
the
door
or
provide
a
nonfrivolous
case,
then
in
almost
every
situation
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
board
to
say
this
is
not
enough,
because
the
existence
of
even--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
that
is
true,
and
as
we
have
argued,
we
believe
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
board
was
within
its
discretion
in
denying
reopening
on
the
separate
ground
that
the
explanation
was
inadequate.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
they
do
not,
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that
is
exactly
right,
and
there
is
really
no
dispute
here
about
prima
facie
case.
i
don't
think
the
ninth
circuit
was
applying
the
test
in
the
manner
suggested
by
justice
scalia
where
it
is
simply
enough
to
show
that
you
might
be
able
to
prove
a
case.
we
think
a
prima
facie
case
means,
if
the
facts
alleged
could
be
proved
at
an
evidentiary
hearing,
would
you
be
eligible
for
the
relief?
the
ninth
circuit,
we
think
it
is
quite
significant,
simply
ignored
one
of
the
two
grounds
relied
upon
by
the
bia.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
even
address
the
issue
of
whether
respondent
had
met
the
regulatory
requirement
208.11
in
his
adequate
explanation.
we
think
that
that
ground
alone
is
basis
for
reversal.
in
addition,
we
submit--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
at
least...
well,
not...
technically
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
that
issue.
the
case
could
be
reversed
solely
on
the
ground
that
respondent
did
not
meet
the
regulatory
requirements
for
reopening.
one
thing
that
is
important
to
point
out
is
that
even
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
decide
that
here
was
a
prima
facie
case
for
withholding.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that
very
well
could
end
the
case.
that
is
a
separate
and
independent
ground.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
there
are
two
grounds.
this
case
is
quite
analogous
to
john
haw
lang,
in
which
the
court
reached
both
the
regulatory
requirement
issue
and
the
prima
facie
case
issue.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
you
don't
have
to.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
our
principal
concern
deals
with
the
way
the
court
analyzed
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
case,
the
standard
that
has
to
be
applied.
one
approach
for
this
court
would
be
to
rule
on
those
two
points--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--the
one
ground
would
be
that
the
ninth
circuit
improperly
second
guessed
the
bia's
holding
that
there
was
no
prima
facie
case,
and
it
did
so
for
two
reasons.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
the
motion
is
there,
justice
stevens.
we
submitted
a
lodging
with
the
clerk
which
has
the
entire
motion
to
reopen,
and--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
because
we
always--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--this
is
a
substitute
for
the
joint
appendix.
we
have
filed
a
motion
to
waive
the
printing.
we
thought
that
particularly
since--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
that
was
not
true.
we
felt
that
because
the
entire
administrative
record
was
reproduced
in
this
volume,
and
since
we
had
already
submitted
it
to
the
clerk--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--counsel
did
not
pose
that.
obviously,
the
court
may
well
wish
to
read
the
motion
to
reopen.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
the
court
could--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--it
does.
the
history
of
that
was
discussed
in
wang.
there
were
two
cases
in
which
the
bia
stated
that
a
prima
facie
case
is
a
requirement
for
a
motion
to
reopen.
and
this
court
noted
that
in
jong
ha
wang,
and
in
fact
has
reaffirmed
those
requirements.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
correct.
and
the
board
would
be,
we
submit,
entitled
to
deference,
and
if
i
could
follow
up
on
justice
stevens'
question,
this
court
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
reach
the
final
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
prima
facie
case.
what
the
court
could
decide
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
applied
the
erroneous
standard
in
analyzing
the
standard
and
simply
send
the
case
back.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
reach
the
issue.
but
let
me
explain
the
two
points--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
don't
concede
that
at
all.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
in
fact--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that
is
correct,
and
in
that
regard,
justice
scalia,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
at
page
20a,
footnote
2
of
the
petitioner's
appendix,
where
it
points
out
that
another
ground
that
the
board
did
not
decide
but
could
have
would
be
the
impact
of
this
individual's
criminal
convictions.
the
board
could
have
decided
here
that
this
individual
as
a
matter
of
discretion
did
not
merit
asylum
and
therefore
that
reopening
could
be
denied
without
an
evidentiary
hearing.
so
that
again
is
another
group.
there
was
simply
no
warrant
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
appropriate.
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
two
principles
that
enabled
it
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
respondent
had
made
a
prima
face
case.
the
first
was,
it
held
that
in
ruling
on
it,
when
the
court
of
appeals
rules
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
a
prima
facie
case,
it
considered
the
issue
de
novo.
the
agency
is
not
given
any
deference
whatsoever
in
its
judgment.
the
second
point
that
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
reviewing
these
cases
is
that
when
the
board
reviews
a
motion
to
reopen,
it
has
to
give
the
alien
all
inferences
or
all
benefits
of
the
doubt.
it
was
only
by
a,
reviewing
the
case
de
novo,
and
b,
reading
every
inference
in
the
alien's
favor,
that
even
the
ninth
circuit
was
able
to
hold
that
there
as
a
prima
facie
case,
and
we
would
submit
that
if
this
court
disagrees
on
those
two
points,
we
think
it
necessarily
follows
that
there
is
no
prima
facie
case.
if
the
board
is
not
required,
for
example,
to
draw
the
inferences
in
the
alien's
favor.
now,
if
i
could
just
very
briefly
discuss
why
it
is
that
we
disagree
with
the
court--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
the
court
had
not.
however--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
that
is
corrected
except
let
me
note
a
number
of
points
in
that
regard.
first
of
all,
on
page
19a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix,
in
the
board's
opinion,
the
board
cites
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
in
cardoza-fonseca,
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
we
would
submit
that
the
board
understood
the
difference
between
the
standards
and
applied
it
here.
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
to
suggest
that
the
board
was
applying
the
same
standard
here,
and
a
couple
of
other
points
are
quite
significant
in
that
regard.
as
we
have
noted
in
our
reply
brief,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
respondent
clearly
indicated...
i
believe
it
was
page
28
of
his
court
of
appeals
brief...
that
he
had
no
objection
whatsoever
to
the
legal
principles
applied
by
the
bia.
we
noted
in
our
court
of
appeals
brief
that
in
our
interpretation
of
the
bia's
opinion
the
bia's
was
correctly
applying
the
lower
standard
for
asylum.
we
made
that
quite
clear
in
our
brief,
and
respondent
in
his
reply
brief
never
challenged
that
and
the
court
of
appeals
never
questioned
the
fact
that
the
ninth
circuit...
or
the
fact
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
understood
and
was
applying
a
lower
standard
for
asylum.
so
would
submit
that
that
is
simply
riot
an
issue
in
this
case.
if
i
could
make
a
few
points
as
to
why
we
disagree
on
the
de
novo
review
point,
first
of
all,
as
i
have
noted,
this
court
has
made
clear
on
several
occasions
that
it
is
not
appropriate
for
the
court
to
engage
in
de
novo
review
in
these
contexts.
rios-pineda
could
not
have
been
clearer
in
stating
that
it
is
not
the
function
of
a
court
to
review
the
attorney
general's
decision
de
novo.
that
was
at
471
u.s.
at
page
452.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
there...
no,
that--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--rios-pineda
was
also
a
question
whether
the
lower
court
had
ordered
that
the
case
be
sent
back
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
i
don't
believe
there
had
been,
and
this
court
said
that
there
did
not
need
to
be
because
the
board
had
denied
relief
to
the
aliens
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
and
there
are
numerous...
the
same
thing
is
true
in
jong
ha
wang,
by
the
way.
there
is
not
a
hearing.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
even
though
no
affidavits
had
been
submitted,
that
the
alien
had
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
that
required
a
hearing,
and
again
the
court
held
that
no
evidentiary
hearing
was
required,
that
same
circumstance,
by
the
way,
is
present
in
numerous
court
of
appeals
cases.
we
have
cited
cases
from
circuits
throughout
the
country
involving
a
situation
exactly
like
this
in
which
there
is
a
motion
to
reopen,
alleging
prima
facie
eligibility
for
asylum
and
withholding
of
deportation,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
prior
to
this
case
have
unanimously
held
that
under
this
court's
decisions
in
rios-pineda
and
jong
ha
wang,
the
decision
on
whether
or
not
there
is
a
prima
facie
case
for
reopening
is
one
that
must
be
given
deference
to
the
administrative
agency,
and
that
is
all
we
are
asking
for
here.
the
ninth
circuit
has
held--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--it
is
the
same
thing.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
as
justice
scalia
correctly
pointed
out,
the
fact
that
you
allege
a
prima
facie
case
does
not
mean
you
are
entitled
to
a
hearing.
it
just
means
that
you
have
met
one
of
the
requirements
that
the
board
has
set
for
a
hearing.
the
board
has
not
said
that
a
hearing
is
required
in
any
circumstance,
however,
and
again,
i
would
point
out,
even
if
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
alleged,
the
board
held
that
its
regularly
requirements
have
not
been
met
for
a
different
reason.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
no,
we
don't
mean
that,
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
what
we
mean
is
that
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--what
we
mean
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
immigration
authorities.
if
reasonable
minds
could
differ,
if
the
board's
opinion
is
a
reasonable
analysis
of
the
evidence,
then
it
must
be
affirmed.
if
the
board's
opinion
makes
no
sense
whatsoever,
if
there
is
something
egregiously
wrong
about
it,
then
obviously
there
is
a
role
for
the
court
to
play.
we
are
not
arguing
that
it
is
totally
unreviewable,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
court
has
to
reach
that
issue.
it
is
really
the
difference
between
how
the
circuits
other
than
this
case
have
approached
the
issue
and
how
this
court
approaches
the
issue.
this
court
says
that
the
inquiry
is
whether
or
not
the
board's
assessment
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
deference
means,
in
our
view--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
it
just
means
as
generally
in
administrative
law,
that
there
ought
to
be
weight
given
to
the
administrative
agency's
views,
and
even
if
the
court
independently--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--only
if
the
decision--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--you
could,
but
only
if
the
decision
is
so
extreme
as
to
be
unreasonable.
if
the
decision
would
reasonably
go
either
way,
we
think
that
the
role
of
the
court
is
to
simply
affirm.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
but
our
point
is,
again,
we
do
not
disagree
with
the
definition
of
prima
face
used
by
the
court.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
court
can
simply
ignore
what
the
agency
has
done,
and
decide
independently
whether
there
is
enough
or
whether
it
has
to
give
deference,
as
we
have
said,
to
what
the
agency
has
said,
and
as
i
have
indicated,
ever
circuit
that
has
analyzed
this
issue
has
explained
that
the
agency's
view
has
to
be
given
great
weight
in
this
context.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
the
court
does
defer--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
think
the
better
analogy
is
a
reopening
for
an
administrative
hearing
or
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
either
a
civil
or
a
criminal
case,
and
there
the
courts
repeatedly
give
great
weight
or
deference
to--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--we
think
it
is
more
like
deferring
to
a
court's
determination
that
the
newly
discovered
evidence
is
not
enough
to
warrant
a
new
trial,
and
there
there
is
substantial
deference.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
would
like
to
refers
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
ultimately,
as
justices
scalia
and
o'connor
recognized,
the
issue
is
whether
the
bia
must
reopen
because
of
a
new
fact,
whether
it
is
compelled
now.
now,
the
bia
accepts
the
fact
that
the
visit
occurred,
and
the
questions
whether
or
not
that
fact
is
so
significant
that
the
ba
must
give
compelling
weight
to
it,
and
the
reason
that
we
are
arguing
that
he
bia
should
be
given
leeway
in
making
these
judgments
is,
number
one,
because
of
the
expertise
that
it
has
in
reviewing
thousands
of
cases,
an
expertise
in
fact
recognized
in
cardoza-fonseca
in
the
decision,
making
clear
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
straight
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
a
question
of
applying
the
law
to
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
i
believe
it
is
slip
opinion
page
26.
and
finally,
the
greatest
deference
of
all
because
in
this
situation,
as
counsel
concedes,
congress
did
not
specify
the
reopening
had
to
be
required
in
any
situation
whatsoever,
and
for
that
reason
we
would
submit
a
particular
degree
of
deference
should
be
given
to
the
body.
consequently,
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
we
would
urge
that
the
judgement
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
