didn't
that
become
clearer
when
this
man
came
over
from
ghana?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
sure,
either,
but
it
could
be
argued,
couldn't
it?
it
was
quite
obvious
that
he
was
trying
to
get
him
back
there
for
one
purpose
only.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
other
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
a
man
would
spend
that
amount
of
money
to
come
over
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
they
is
trying
to
kill
his
own
family
but
they
are
going
to
bring
him
back
and
let
him
live?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
the
testimony.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
was
still
out
and
was
still
wanted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
way
to
get
around
and
find
out
whether
a
conclusory
allegation
is
correct
is
one
way
only,
and
that
is
to
hold
a
hearing.
isn't
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
had
kept
up
with
the
history,
hadn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
kept
up
with
the
doctor
and
what
he
was
doing
and
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
am
saying,
so
why
do
they
want
him
back
if
they
don't
know
where
he
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
clear
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
keep
using
the
word
"deference".
do
you
mean
that
a
decision
of
the
bia
on
the
question
of
a
prima
facie
case
is
unappealable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
deference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
mean
by
us
using
deference--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--abandonment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can't
i
give
weight
to
them
and
rule
against
them--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
congress
did
not
do
it.
congress
left
it
to
the
attorney
general.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
understand
your
argument
at
all.
they
left
it
to
the
attorney
general.
they
could
have
taken
it
over.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said,
congress
could
have
said
it
and
be
reopened.
justice
thurgood
marshall
instead,
congress
said
the
attorney
general
shall
decide
whether
it
can
be
reopened.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
were
you
prepared
to
show
at
the
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
were
you
prepared
to
put
on
in
evidence
at
the
hearing--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--if
you
have
been
granted
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what?
on
what
particulars?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
possibly,
what
you
could
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
had
in
hand,
ready
to
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
have
put
that
in
your
original
motion?
