justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
as...
i
am
a
little
puzzled
now
about
what
the
exact
issue
is.
do
you
think
we
have
to
decide
whether
the
motion
to
reopen
states
a
prima
facie
case
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
are
you
arguing
that
because
he
didn't
meet
the
regulatory
requirements
for
failing
to
explain
why
he
didn't
make
the
point
earlier,
that
ends
the
case
and
we
don't
even
have
to
look
at
the
motion
to
see--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
is
that
your
principal
submission?
what
is
your
principal
submission?
i
have
a
little
difficult
with
these
question
presented--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
certainly
don't
have
to
reach
both,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is,
which
is
your
principal
claim?
what
are
you
really
asking
us
to
decide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
we
have
alternative
ways
of
doing
it.
i
am
trying
to
find
out
what
you
are...
if
you
could
write
the
opinion,
what
would
you
say
in
the
opinion?
do
you
put
it
on
one
ground
only.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
you
mainly
wanted
to
decide
whether
the
motion
states
a
prima
facie
case.
and
if
that
is
true,
i
don't
even
find
the
motion
in
the
papers
before
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
not
in
the
printed
materials.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
there
a
joint
appendix
within
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
that
time
you
apparently
didn't
think
we'd
need
to
even
read
the
motion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
we
would
have
to
read
it
to
decide
your
theory
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
the
prima
facie
case?
when
this
was
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeal,
had
we
decided
cardoza-fonseca
yet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
had
the
case
at
a
time
when
the
law
was
somewhat
unclear
as
to
what
the
prima
facie
case
might
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
was
a
decision
after
a
hearing,
wasn't
it?
it
wasn't
a
review
of
a
pleading.
or
was
it?
i
don't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
is
a
difference
between
reviewing
whether
a
leading
is
sufficient
to
state
a
cause
of
action
or
prima
facie
case
on
the
one
hand
and
reviewing
whether
the
evidence
made
out
a
case
on
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
had
there
been
no
evidentiary
hearing
before?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
also
get
something
straight.
a
prima
face
case
for
reopening
in
other
words,
is
a
different...
something
different
from
a
prima
face
case
for
eligibility
for
withholding
of
deportation
or
asylum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
the
same,
the
same
facts
would...
if
facts
a,
b,
and
c
in
an
original
claim
would
constitute
a
prima
facie
case
for
a
claim
of
asylum,
that
would
also
constitute
a
prima
facie
case
for
reopening
after?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
are
you
in
effect
conceding
that
if
there
had
not
been
the
visit
by
this
gentleman
from
ghana
after,
you
know,
that
you
use
as
a
basis
for
the
new
evidence
of
well-founded...
without
that
visit
you
would
not
state
a
prima
facie
case
for
reopening
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
change
of
law
that
you
rely
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
is
the
law
different
than
it
was
in
1982?
