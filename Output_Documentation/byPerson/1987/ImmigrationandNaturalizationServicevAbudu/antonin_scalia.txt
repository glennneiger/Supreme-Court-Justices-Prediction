justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
is
it
at
least
the
kind
of
fact
that
establishes
a
prima
facie
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute.
he
has
conclusory
allegation,
as
you
say,
and
he
had
in
addition
a
fact
to
support
that
which
you
claim
was
ambiguous.
now,
that
may
not
be
enough
to
carry
the
day,
but
isn't
that
enough
to
establish
prima
facie
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
is
just
one
of
the
conditions.
i
mean,
it
isn't
as
though
the
only
thing
standing
before
the
board
and
reopening
is
the
prima
facie
case
requirement.
there
are
other
requirements,
as
you
are
urging
upon
us,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask,
while
we
were
trying
to
decide
what
we
have
on
our
plate
here,
even
assuming
that
we
disagreed
with
you
and
thought
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
on
the
prima
facie
case
point,
and
on
ignoring
the
regulatory
requirements,
do
you
concede
then
that
if
they
were
right
about
that,
the
proper
relief
that
the
ninth
circuit
should
have
afforded
was
to
require
a
reopening?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
those
regulatory
requirements
and
the
prima
facie
case
are
conditions
to
a
reopening,
but
there
is
nothing
that
i
know
of
that
says
that
if
you
meet
those
there
must
be
a
reopening.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
is
another
piece
on
our
plate.
we
could
go
off
on
that
ground,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
klonoff,
i
have
a
problem
with
deference
to
a
judgment
about
a
prima
facie
case
or
not.
i
mean,
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
on
the
ultimate
question,
the
ultimate
factfinding,
you
go
along
with
the
agency
if
there
is
substantial
evidence.
reasonable
minds
could
go
either
way
and
therefore
you
let
the
agency
go
the
way
it
wants
so
long
as
it
is
reasonable.
but
the
whole
notion
of
a
prima
facie
case
is
rock
bottom.
it
means
a
reasonable
mind.
if
the
phrase
means
anything,
it
means
a
reasonable
mind
could
find
for
someone
one
these
allegations,
giving
them
the
benefit
for
the
doubt,
interpreting
doubts
in
favor
of
the
person
making
the
allegations.
isn't
that
what
a
prima
facie
case
means,
and
then
to
say
you
have
a
sort
of
applying
a
reasonableness
standard
to
a
reasonableness
standard.
it
is
once
removed.
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
any
different
form,
in
civil
cases,
we
defer
to
the
factfinders,
let's
say,
a
case
tried
to
a
judge.
we
defer
to
the
judge's
findings
of
fact.
unless
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
for
them,
we
accept
them.
but
do
we
defer
to
the
trial
judge's
determination
that
summary
judgment
could
be
granted.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we?
do
we
say,
well,
you
know,
maybe
summary
get
could
be
granted,
maybe
it
couldn't.
it
is
a
close
question.
we
defer
to
the
trial
judge.
we
don't
do
that.
summary
judgment
is
rock
bottom,
and
so,
it
seems
to
me,
is
prima
facie
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
to
factfinding,
though.
you
are
referring...
we
defer
to
them
because
we
defer
to
their
judgment
about
whether
they
want
to
reopen
or
not.
you
are
asking
us
to
defers
to
factfinding
about
whether
there
is
a
prima
facie
case
or
not.
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
defer
to
the
board's
determination
that
it
doesn't
want
to
reopen
for
policy
reasons,
for
whatever
else,
but
you
are
asking
us
not
to
defer
to
that,
you
are
asking
us
to
defer
to
their
determination
that
there
was
or
was
not
a
prima
facie
case.
and
that
seems
to
me
like
deferring
to
a
district
judge's
determination
that
there
was
enough
evidence
or
was
not
enough
evidence
to
grant
a
summary
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
regulatory
requirements,
ms.
harper?
why
were
they
met
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
harper,
let's
come
back
to
the
regulatory
requirements.
this
visit
by
al
hassan,
it
isn't
just
that
this
was
new
evidence
demonstrating
a
need
for
asylum
that
had
been
asserted
earlier.
he
had
never
asserted
a
need
for
asylum
earlier.
he
had
never
even
claimed
that
he
was
going
to
be
persecuted
if
he
went
back
in
the
earlier
hearing.
it
isn't
that
this
was
a
new
piece
of
evidence
to
support
a
prior
claim.
what
he
was
asking
the
board
to
believe
is
that
he
had
no
reason
whatever
to
believe
he
was
going
to
be
persecuted
until
this
visit
by
al
hassan
occurred,
that
that
alone
is
enough
to
explain
why
he
never
raised
the
asylum
request
before.
is
the
board
really
compelled
to
accept
that
as
a
reasonable
proposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
comes
to
the
board
now
and
he
says,
the
one
enormous
thing
that...
it
is
not
just
an
additional
piece
of
evidence,
but
what
has
made
me
charge
my
mind
about
whether
i
need
asylum
or
not
is
this
possibly
innocuous
visit
by
al
hassan.
the
board
really
must
reopen
because
of
that,
and
must
believe
that
that
one
event
is
what
suddenly
changed
this
man
from
a
person
who
didn't
need
asylum
to
one
that
did?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
is
irrational
to
conclude
otherwise?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
that
seems
to
me
quite
reasonably,
that
if
he
didn't
think
he
had
a
case
then
or
a
case
that
would
be
denied,
we
shouldn't
penalize
him
for
that.
but
the
problem
i
am
having
with
your
case
is
the
assertion
that
this
one
fact
does
make
so
much
of
a
difference,
i
mean,
one
might
argue
that
it
makes
enough
of
a
difference
to
just
tip
the
scales,
but
the
argument
you
are
making
to
us
is
that
it
so
clearly
make
that
difference
that
it
is
arbitrary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
ins
to...
not
to
allow
it
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
a
hard
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
some
time
still,
ms.
harper.
don't
panic.
assuming
that
you
are
right
about
the
prima
facie
problem,
and
assuming
that
you
are
right
about
the
regulatory
requirements,
assuming,
in
short,
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
right
on
all
of
the
points
it
decided,
why
was
its
proper
action
to
direct
an
evidentiary
hearing?
why
shouldn't
it
have
just
remanded
to
have
the
board
do
it
right
next
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
requirement
in
law
that
there
been
an
evidentiary
hearing.
all
that
the
ninth
circuit
decided
is
that
the
board
gave
the
wrong
reasons
for
denying
an
evidentiary
hearing,
but
why
could
it
command
an
evidentiary
hearing?
where
in
the
status
or
even
in
the
board's
regulation
does
it
say
your
client
is
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
if
he
makes
out
an
evidentiary
case
and
comes
within
the
regulatory
requirements?
it
is
still
within
the
board's
discretion,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
claiming
it
is
the
board's
laws
that
if
you
meet
these
two
requirements,
prima
facie
case
and
meet
the
regulatory
requirements,
you
will
get
an
evidentiary
hearing.
