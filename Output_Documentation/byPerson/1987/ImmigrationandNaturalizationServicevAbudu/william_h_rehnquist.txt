chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-1128,
immigration
and
naturalization
service
versus
assisi
abudu.
mr.
klonoff,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
klonoff,
then
reopening
is
not
a
procedure
provided
for
by
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
the
regulations
in
any
way
define
what
a
prima
facie
case
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
it
is
really
up
to
the
bia
to
determine
what
a
prima
facie
case
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
does
the
term
"prima
facie"
case
come
in
here?
it
is
not
in
the
regulations.
it
is
not
in
the
statute.
does
the
bia
use
it
in
its
opinions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
is
really
is
interpretation
then
of
the
applicable
regulations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klonoff.
ms.
harper,
we
will
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
harper,
that
may
well
be
true
in
the
context
of,
say,
a
motion
to
dismiss
under
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
or
the
analog
in
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
but
why
should
the
bia
be
governed
by
that
kind
of
a
strict
legal
mode
that
we
allege
certain
things,
and
then
if
there
is
a
contest
we
have
a
hearing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
think
it
should
be
analyzed
just
as
if
we
were
in
a
federal
district
court
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
with
the
rules
of
civil
procedure?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
one
fact
by
itself
requires
the
bia
to
reopen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
there
was
no
application
for
asylum
previously?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
how
can
you
say
the
facts
are
stacked
when
the
facts
previously
were
never
used
as
a
basis
to
apply
for
asylum?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
ms.
harper.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
klonoff,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klonoff.
the
case
is
submitted.
