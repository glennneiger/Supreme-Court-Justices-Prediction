justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
doctor
through
his
counsel
affirmatively
say
in
april
that
he
did
not
intend
to
apply
for
asylum,
even
though
he
had
previously
said
he
did
intend?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
never
submitted
his--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
the
deportation
proceeding,
although
he
had
been
reminded
many
times
that
he
wanted
to,
he
had
better
do
it.
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
instead,
he
just
applied
for
an
adjustment
of
status.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
now
the
board
has
to
reopen
that
proceeding,
because...
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
fact.
