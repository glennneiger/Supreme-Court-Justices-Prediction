ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
would
like
to
first
state
our
view
of
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
this
case.
when
we
look
at
the
finding
of
the
circuit
court,
we
remember
basic
rules,
basic
things
that
we
were
supposed
to
be
studying
in
law
school,
the
approach
to
a
case,
the
approach
to
resolving
a
conflict.
in
pullman
standard
versus
swint
this
court
did
make
reference
to
this
in
the
context
of
discussing
whether
there
are
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact.
the
approach
that
was
discussed
and
which
we
remember
from
those
days,
three
steps.
first,
there
is
the
establishing
of
the
historical
facts.
second,
there
is
selecting
the
applicable
rule
of
law.
and
third
is
applying
the
rule
of
law
to
the
established
facts.
in
the
prima
facie
case
test,
however,
i
think
one
comes
through
the
same
steps,
but
at
the
first
step
of
establishing
the
historical
evidentiary
facts,
in
the
traditional
prima
facie
case
test,
the
adjudicator
of
the
tests
does
not
determine
the
facts,
he
or
she
accepts
the
facts
that
have
been
offered.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
mr.
justice,
we
believe
that
is
because
the
bia
chose
the
prima
facie
case
test,
chose
prima
facie
case.
this
is
not
in
the
regulations,
as
came
out
in
the
earlier
discussion,
when
the
attorney
general
made
the
regulations
he
did
not
state
in
what
instance
motions
to
reopen
should
be
granted.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
1972
in
the
case
of
in
re
sipus
said
ordinarily
we
would
grant
reopening
if
this
person
would
have
given
us
a
prima
facie
case.
and
it
is
our
view
that
because
the
board
selected
it
wasn't
imposed
upon
the
board
by
the
courts.
they
voluntarily
selected
prima
facie
case,
a
term
that
has
general
meaning
that
they
should--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--no,
i
don't
think
foursquare
exactly
on
all
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
no,
mr.
justice,
i
certainly
don't,
because
we
are
not
talking
about
exactly
the
same
thing.
i
am
talking
about
the
underlying
principle.
i
am
talking
about
the
basics
of
what
a
prima
facie
case
is
and
the
basic
approach
in
any
context
of
deciding
if
there
has
been
a
prima
facie
case,
but
i
am
not
arguing
the
federal
rules
for
civil
procedure.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
madam
justice,
i
think
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
certainly
can
exercise
its
discretion
in
the
discretionary
aspect
of
the
case,
but
in
this
case
they
didn't.
they
did
not
address
or
examine
any
discretionary
factors.
i
don't
think
that
the
fact...
the
standard
as
announced
by--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--if
the
bia
denies,
period,
without
announcing
a
standard,
simply
in
essence,
if
you
will,
we
just
don't
want
to
hear
this
one
today,
that
is
arbitrary,
and
even
if
it
is
discretion,
it
is
an
arbitrary
exercise
of
discretion.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
no,
we
are
arguing
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
chose
not
to
examine
the
discretionary
factors,
chose
not
to
exercise
that
discretion,
which
it
has.
instead,
it
chose
to
make
the
decision
that
there
had
not
been
a
prima
facie
case
shown
and
that
is
the
finding
that
was
reviewed.
the
ninth
circuit
did
also
review
and
made
very
brief
reference
to
the
establishing
of
new
facts.
if
we
very
carefully
examine
the
bia
decision,
we
find
that
the
manner
in
which
they
interpreted,
they,
one,
chose
to
interpret,
chose
to
determine,
and
the
manner
in
which
they
did
determine
the
motive
of
the
caller
from
the
ghanian
government
was
the
fact
that
led
to
their
conclusion
that
this
was
not...
that
there
had
not
been
a
sufficient
explanation.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
said
we
don't
think
that
by
itself
this
visit
sufficiently
explains
failure
to
raise
this
earlier.
and
when
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
they
had
determined
a
fact
they
shouldn't
have
determined,
and
that
the
facts
should
be
interpreted
otherwise,
then
it
became
an
explanation.
that
answered
the
question,
and
there
was
reference
to
that
in
the
circuit
court
opinion.
it
was
not
a
lengthy
reference
because
it
did
sort
of
emerge
as
self-proving
fact.
it
is
our
opinion
that
when
we
look
at
these
steps
in
resolving
the
prima
facie
case
test,
we
find
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
here
basically
was,
you
determined
a
fact
when
you
weren't
supposed
to
determine
it.
you
went
wrong
on
the
first
step.
the
circuit
court
did
not
go
on
to
examine
the
application
of
the
selection
of
the
correct
rule
of
law
as
applied
to
the
refuge
law.
the
circuit
court
did
not
do
an
examination
of
the
application
of
the
laws
to
the
facts.
now,
this
is
the
area
where
if
there
is
discretion,
deference
to
be
given
to
the
bia,
it
would
be
in
the
last
area
of
applying
the
facts
to
the
law,
an
this
was
not
examined
by
the
circuit
court.
what
they
examined
was...
what
they
found
to
be
the
error
was
the
very
first
step.
they
were
supposed
to
accept
the
facts
and
not
decide
them.
we
talk
about
he
prima
facie
case
test,
where
it
came
from,
the
regulations,
where
they
came
from.
it
is
respondent's
position
that
this
must
begin
with
an
analysis
of
what
congress
did
in
refugee
law.
prior
cases
have
been
before
this
court
dealing
with
immigration
cases.
this
has
been
probably
the
central
lesson,
the
common
lesson.
we
look
at
what
congress
has
done
in
the
area.
that
was
done
in
wang.
it
was
done
in
phinpathya,
it
was
done
in
stevic,
it
was
done
in
cardoza-fonseca.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
no,
that
is
correct,
madam
justice.
what
congress
did,
congress
mandated
that
the
attorney
general
shall
provide
a
procedure
for
aliens
to
apply
for
asylum
irrespective
of
status.
dr.
abudu's
status
was
a
deportable
alien.
irrespective
of
status,
he
has
the
right
or
should
have
an
opportunity
to
apply.
now,
thy
didn't
say
reopening,
but
congress
not
only
considered
changes
of
circumstances,
congress
wrote
changes
of
circumstances
into
the
law,
not
the
refugee
law.
subsection
b
of
the...
this
section
208(a)
provides
that
if
you
are
granted
asylum
status
and
you
lose
your
status
as
a
refugee,
your
asylum
status
is
terminated.
throughout
they
talk
of
refugee
status.
you
have
to
have
refugee
status
to
be
eligible
to
apply.
you
lose
your
asylum
status
if
you
lose
your
refugee
status.
in
the
following
section,
section
209
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
after
you
have
been...
you
have
been
in
refugee
or
asylum
status
for
one
year,
you
may
apply
to
become
a
permanent
resident,
but
you
must
also
show
that
you
have
not
lost
your
refugee
status.
and
they
use
the
word,
they
include
the
phrase,
charge
of
circumstances.
if
congress
foresaw
that
people
would
lose
asylum
status,
not
be
able
to
become
permanent
residents
because
of
changes
of
circumstances,
certainly
congress
also
foresaw
that
one
would
acquire
refugee
status
because
of
change
of
circumstances
and
would
qualify
upon
events
that
occurred
after
they
came
into
the
country
and
after
various
events
may
have
happened
to
change
their
status.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
pardon?
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
yes.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice.
would
you
repeat
that,
mr.
justice?
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
yes.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
i
agree
somewhat,
mr.
justice.
they
certainly
did
not
say
that
it
should
be
reopened.
they
left
it
up
to
the
attorney
general
to
devise
procedures,
and
then
attorney
general
devised
procedures,
including
procedures
for
reopening,
and
these
procedures
for
reopening
were
followed
in
this
case,
and
incidentally,
counsel
would
like
at
this
point
to
point
out
a
little
correction.
i
understand
that
in
preparing
these
cases
the
government
is
certainly
no
different
from
i
and
they
make
mistakes,
but
this
is
where
we
said
we
have
no
problems
with
the
principles
of
the
laws.
in
our
brief
to
the
ninth
circuit
on
page
28
discussing
the
regulations
for
reopening,
8
cfr
208.11
requires
the
alien
to
reasonably
explain
failure
to
request
asylum
prior
to
the
completion
of
deportation,
citation,
and
then
we
go
on
to
say
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
principles
of
law.
this
is
where
we
have
no
quarrel,
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
regulations.
we
believe
these
regulations
are
proper.
it
is
simply
our
position
that
we
complied
with
the
regulations.
we
respect
them.
dr.
abudu
played
by
the
rules.
he
didn't
bring
this
case
when
the
law
as
it
was
being
interpreted
at
that
time
together
with
the
facts
would
not
support
all
of
the
elements
necessary
for
the
trial.
the
government
now
says...
well,
now
that
your
case
has
ripened,
your
case
should
be...
reopening
should
be
denied
because
you
didn't
bring
it
when
it
was
premature.
this
is--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--under
the
law
as
it
was
when
he
was
before
the
immigration
judge
in
1982
it
would
not
have
met...
would
not
have
met
the
requirements
at
that
time.
at
this
time
it
is
the
visit
that--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--pardon?
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
this
court
addressed
the
distinctions
between
clear
probability,
well
founded
fear
in
the
stevic
case.
now,
that
case,
i
am
well
aware,
of
course,
that
was
not
the
case
that
made
the
definitive
ruling
on
well
founded
fear,
but
when
this
court
spoke
in
stevic,
those
of
us
out
there
on
the
front
lines
trying
to
bring
justice
to
our
clients
saw,
we
saw
rays
of
hope
that
there
was
in
fact
a
ground,
that
we
had
a
sound
legal
basis
to
in
good
faith
advance
our
theories
that
a
well
founded
fear
was
different.
therefore
what
we
would
have
brought
in
1984,
1985
is
quite
different
from
what
we
would
bring
in
1982.
we
didn't
have
the
solid
law,
but
this
court
had
spoken,
and
had
given
some
guidance,
we
felt,
in
dictum,
and
as...
there
also
had
been
decision
in
the
circuit
courts
that
were
beginning
to
develop.
but
to
answer
your
question,
yes,
it
was
the
visit
which
created
the...
or
gave
the
last
of
the
elements
that
we
believe
clearly
puts
the
case
within
the
prima
facie
case
test.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
the
regulatory
requirements
were
met
by
virtue
of
the
fact
the
events
that
provided
the
objective
evidence
that
this
man's
fear
is
reasonable
didn't
even
happen
until
after
deportation
proceedings
were
concluded.
that,
of
course,
met...
it
meant
a
two-fold
requirement.
one,
it
met
the
requirement
of
new
material,
and
two,
in
and
of
itself
it
explains
why
he
didn't
bring
it
in
1982,
because
it
hadn't
happened
in
1982.
also,
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
mention,
and
i
understand
this
record
can
get
a
little
confusing.
all
of
these
continuances
and
how
long
this
case
has
been
going
on.
november
10,
1981,
was
when
dr.
abudu
first
stood
before
the
immigration
judge
and
he
said,
i
am
afraid
to
go
back
to,
ghana.
november
10,
1981,
according
to
the
record,
and
i
understand
there
was
somewhat
of
a
problem
here,
but
on
that
date,
he
was
appearing
on
what
we
call
a
master
calendar,
sort
of
like
an
arraignment
or
plea
court,
and
his
attorney
announced
that
they
would
be
disputing,
they
were
not
conceding
deportability,
so
the
case
was
set
for
hearing.
it
was
not
continued
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
file
asylum.
he
was
told,
well,
then
we
will
have
to
set
it
at
a
time
when
we
have
more
time
to
hear
the
issues
on
the
issue
of
deportability.
that
is
why
it
was
continued
the
first
time
and
set
for
another
date.
that
is
on
page
45
of
volume
1
of
the
record.
the
second
time
they
went
in,
ready
to
contest
and
go
over
the
issue
of
deportability,
and
the
government
was
there
with
a
new
charge,
so
here
was
something
new
that
had
to
be
answered.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
mr.
justice,
i
think
this
again
goes
back
to
the
problem
with
the
record.
on
the
november
10
hearing,
he
asked
to...
if
you
are...
it
is
a
standard
part
of
the
procedure
to
be
asked
if
you
have
to
be
deported,
what
country
would
you
wish
to
be
deported
to,
and
he
named
first
canada
and
was
told
he
couldn't
name
canada,
and
he
named
england,
and
he
said,
and
the
judge
said,
do
you
feel
your
life
of
freedom
would
be
threatened
in
ghana
on
accountant
of
race,
religion,
nationality,
membership
in
a
particular
social
group,
or
a
political
opinion?
answer
from
dr.
abudu.
i
can
say
my
life,
yes.
on
which
of
these
groups?
political
opinion.
this
is
all
that
was
said.
at
that
time
he
asserted
his
fear.
the
first
attempt
to--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--he
did
not
make
an
actual
application.
he
did
not
pursue
an
application.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
yes,
if
we
examine
what
elements
of--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--yes,
mr.
justice,
i
believe
so.
if
we
examine
the
elements
of
the
case,
in
1981,
when
he
first
went
before
the
judge,
the
government
in
ghana
was
in
shaky
condition.
it
was
still
being
led,
at
least
figuratively,
by
dr.
abudu's
brother
and
friends.
two
months
later,
they
were
ousted
in
a
violent
coup,
and
flight
lieutenant
rawlings
took
over
the
government.
dr.
abudu
is
still
in
deportation
proceedings.
dr.
abudu's
friend,
the
minister
of
state,
was
put
in
jail.
his
lifelong
friend,
lieutenant
colonel
hamidu,
was
declared
number
one
enemy.
and
his
brother
got
out
of
the
country
and
went
into
to
exile.
that
is
what
we
have
by
the
end
of
deportation
proceedings
we
do
not
have
any
evidence,
and
what
we
have
today
shows
that
none
of
this
existed
to
show
that
the
government
of
ghana
knew
who
dr.
abudu
was,
knew
where
he
was,
that
they
were
interested
in
him
in
any
way,
and
he
had
not
taken
a
stand
against
the
government
of
ghana.
that
is
what
was
missing
in
1982.
and
those
were
the
element's
that
were--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--yes,
he
did
not
intend
to
apply.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
and
he
did
not
file
an
application.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
because
he
has
stated
new
facts
that
were
not
in
existence
at
that
time
that
now
support
a
case.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
the
visit
from
the
ghanaian
official
combined
with--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--combined
with
the
fact
that
when
this
man
came
to
see
him,
dr.
abudu's
brother
and
his
lifelong
friend,
lieutenant
colonel
hamidu,
just
the
year
before
had
been
named
as
suspects
in
a
plot
to
overthrow
the
ghanian
government
on
two
separate
occasions.
then
the...
that
was
'83,
one
year
after
deportation
proceedings.
eighty-four,
somebody
comes
to
see
dr.
abudu
and
wants
to
know
about
his
brother,
about
lieutenant
colonel
hamidu.
one
fact
by
itself
does
not
a
case
constitute.
it
is
the
attacking
of
the
facts
as
they
occur
one
after
the
other.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
if
that
fact
adds
the
last
of
the
needed
ingredients
for
the
case,
yes,
mr.
justice.
if
that
fact--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--yes,
mr.
justice.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to...
in
response
to
that,
i
would
like
to
inquire
and
make
a
rhetorical
question.
had
he
filed
an
application
in
1982,
what
would
have
happened
to
it?
would
it
have
been
granted?
we
know
by
looking
at
the
cases
that
that
would
not
have
been
granted.
we
looked
at
the
precedent
decisions.
so
where
would
he
have
been
in
1984
with
an
application
for
asylum
which
had
been
denied
that
he
wanted
reopened
for
additional
fact?
what
i
am
saying,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
i
don't
believe
that
our
justice
system,
that
our
efficient
running
of
the
administrative
and
judicial
system
is
served
by
requiring
people
to
bring
it,
if
it
has
any-type
of
remotely
colorable
basis,
bring
it
when
you
are
in
court,
because
if
you
don't
bring
it
when
you
are
in
court,
we
are
going
to
deny
you
later.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
mr.
justice,
i
understand--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--i
understand,
mr.--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--but
when
we
look
at
the
elements,
when
we
compare
what
happened
in
his
one
time
in
1984
and
we
compare
it
to
the
elements,
this
visit
is
what
let
d.
abudu
know,
what
gave
him
objective
evidence
of
what
he
had
felt,
but
you
can
prove
your
case
on
what
you
fuel,
it
gave
him
the
objective
evidence
that
the
government
of
ghana
was
interested
in
him,
the
government
of
ghana
wanted
to
talk
to
him.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
there
is
leeway
to
exercise
discretion.
they
chose
not
to
do
it.
their
decision
has
to
rise
or
fall
on
the
basis
stated.
i
see
my
light,
and
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--or
reasons
advanced--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--the
board
of
immigration
appeals
has
told
us
we
would
ordinarily
grant,
if
you
give
us
a
prima
facie
case
we
will
grant
reopening.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
and
on
reopening--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--in
re
sipus.
first
case
it
talked
about
the
prima
facie
case.
it
is
also
mentioned
in
matter
of
garcia,
which
was
cited
by
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
in
their
amicus
brief.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
they
have
stated,
it
is
what
we
want,
when
we
grant
it...
i
don't
wish
to
be
misleading.
i
fully
recognize
that
subsequent
to
that
time
there
has
been
the
modification
of
this
court
that
the
board
may
deny
on
the
exercise
of
discretion,
but
the
board
gave
us
the
test.
they
told
us
what
they
wanted,
and
we
give
them
what
they
want.
we
meet...
we
represent
he
facts
that
we
believe
are
necessary
to
meet
the
prima
facie
case
test.
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
think
that
congress
has
told
us
what
their...
they
have
laid
a
narrow
path
for
the
attorney
general
on
refugee
law.
they
have
mandated
that
there
be
a
procedure.
the
board
has
told
us...
the
attorney
general
gave
us
regulations.
the
board
told
us
what
they
were
looking
for.
and
i
think
that
all
of
the
use
segments
of
the
law--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--pardon?
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
additional--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--additional
evidence.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
additional
possibly
witnesses--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--okay.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
okay.
we
have
in
hand
dr.
abudu's
testimony.
we
have
documents.
we
have
some
letters.
i
believe,
and
i
do
not
wish
to
misrepresents,
so
i
have
to
say
i
believe
that
we
have
a
copy
of
the
ghanian
newspaper
with
headlines,
number
one,
about
hamidu
being
declared
number
one
enemy,
and
a
price
on
his
head--
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
--we
did
not
have
it.
it
took
us
two
months
to
get
the
evidence
we
were
searching
on
three
continents
in
order
to
meet
our
prima
facie
entry
level
of
evidence.
we
didn't
receive
affidavits,
and
we
were
able
to
get
the
affidavits.
we
got
materials
from
england.
this
did
not
come
in,
and
this
is
one
reason
that
it
took
two
months
to
get
the
case
together.
we
were
waiting
to
try
to
get
that.
ms.
dorothy
a.
harper
thank
you.
