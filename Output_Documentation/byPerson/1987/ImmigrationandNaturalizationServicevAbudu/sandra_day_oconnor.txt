mr.
klonoff,
is
that
new
evidence
not
available
before
within
them
engaging
of
the
regulation,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think
it
was
new
evidence
not
available
before,
but
you
take
the
position
that
it
just
wasn't
material.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
harper,
do
you
think
that
at
bottom
in
this
immigration
setting,
that
the
bia
had
discretion
to
decide
whether
to
decide
whether
to
grant
someone
status
to
remain
or
not
and
discretion
to
decide
whether
to
grant
rehearing
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
if
they
decide...
if
the
bia
decides
to
deny
rehearing,
that
that
could
be
an
exercise
of
discretion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
yes,
certainly
it
could
be,
but
you
are
not
arguing
that
that
was
the
situation
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
congress
didn't
provide
for
rehearing
motions
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
ms.
harper,
why
can't
the
bia
hearing
officer
say,
let's
accept
this
statement,
and
let's
recognize
that
the
visit
had
been
made
by
the
ghanian
official,
but
even
recognizing
that,
i
don't
think
that
is
enough
to
justify
granting
rehearing.
i
don't
think
that
is
enough
to
change
this
person's
status.
now,
isn't
there
some
leeway
there
for
the
bia
to
take
that
position?
