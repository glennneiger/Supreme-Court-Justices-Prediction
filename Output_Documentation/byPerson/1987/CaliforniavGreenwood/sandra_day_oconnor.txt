justice
o'connor
mr.
pear,
in
response,
your
opponent
raises
now
a
due
process
argument
based
on
the
california
law
here
and
constitution
giving
the
owner
of
the
trash
some
protected
liberty
interest
in
the
trash,
and
certainly
the
law
in
the
state
of
california
is
different
than
that
of
a
good
many
states.
now,
do
we
need
to
address
that
due
process
question?
justice
o'connor
but
that
isn't
the
argument
as
i
understood
it.
it's
not
the
entire
nation,
but
the
argument
as
i
understood
it
was
that
a
state
may
define
the
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
of
its
own
citizens,
and
the
california
legislature
says
nobody
should
search
garbage,
or
something
like
that.
would
then
could
not
one
then
make
the
argument
that
a
california
citizen,
unlike
the
rest
of
the
country,
has
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
his
garbage?
justice
o'connor
what
if
most
states
began
to
adopt
a
provision
like
california's?
would
our
view
of
what's
reasonable
then
change
under
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
case
interprets
the
california
constitution
and
laws,
presumably.
justice
o'connor
would
that
then
affect
our
view
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
what's
reasonable
as
an
expectation?
justice
o'connor
should
we
apply
the
katz
analysis
here,
do
you
think,
or
should
we
look
at
it
as
a
question
of
abandonment?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
under
the
fourth
amendment
we
still
look
at
abandonment
as
a
separate
sort
of
test
or
approach?
justice
o'connor
well,
counsel,
in
open
field
searches,
for
example,
where
state
law
might
make
a
trespass
to
come
on
to
the
open
field
or
the
premises,
that
hasn't
determined
the
federal
law
on
whether
evidence
should
be
suppressed
in
a
prosecution,
has
it?
we
haven't
enforced
the
state
trespass
laws?
justice
o'connor
why
isn't
that
up
to
the
state
of
california?
