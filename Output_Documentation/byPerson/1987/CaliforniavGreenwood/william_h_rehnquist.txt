chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
86-684,
california
versus
billy
greenwood
and
dyanne
van
houten.
mr.
pear,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
pear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
pear,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pear.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
garey.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
state
law
issue,
mr.
garey?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
then
the
search
and
seizure
provision
of
the
california
constitution
was
interpreted
in
the
state
supreme
court
krivda
opinion,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
we
have
determined,
have
we
not,
that
the
decision
rested
at
least
partially
on
federal
grounds?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
therefore
be
reviewable
here
under
michigan
v.
long,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
it's
been
decided
that
both
federal
and
state
grounds
support
krivda,
certainly
the
federal
question
is
posed,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
you
raise
this
point
in
your
memorandum
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you
didn't,
there's
language
in
our
tuttle
opinion
which
would
suggest
that
you
have
waived
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
we
were
to
reverse
this
judgment
here
under
the
1982
amendment,
the
california
constitution
provision
on
unreasonable
seizure
would
be
interpreted
the
same
as
we
interpreted
ours,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
supposing
we
were
to
reverse
here
on
fourth
amendment
grounds
saying
that
search
of
trash
does
not
require
a
warrant.
under
your
1982
amendment,
wouldn't
that
also
mean
that
the
california
cognizant
provision
was
interpreted
the
same
way?
chief
justice
rehnquist
they
lost
it
because
the
people
of
california
took
it
away
from
them.
it's
not
an
accident.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
aware
do
you
think
the
voters
of
the
united
states
were
of
the
contents
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
they
ratified
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what
does
your
argument
bear
on?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
they
did.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
answer
the
question
when
you
say,
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
garey.
your
time
has
expired.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
pear,
if
you
have
any.
you
have
13
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pear.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
no.
86-684,
california
against
greenwood,
no.
87-339,
city
of
new
york
versus
federal
communications
commission
will
be
announced
by
