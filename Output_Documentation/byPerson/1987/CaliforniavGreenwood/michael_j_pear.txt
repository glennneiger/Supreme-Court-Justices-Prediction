mr.
michael
j.
pear
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
california
court
of
appeals,
fourth
appellate
district.
in
february
1984,
the
laguna
beach
police
department
received
some
tips
over
the
telephone
that
the
occupants
of
a
specific
residence
located
in
the
city
of
laguna
beach
were
involved
in
drug
trafficking.
based
on
that
information,
on
april
6,
1984
and
again
on
may
4th,
investigators
of
the
police
department
contacted
the
regular
municipal
trash
collector
when
the
morning
trash
was
collected
at
that
residence.
the
investigators
requested
of
the
trash
collector
that
he
go
down
the
street,
pick
up
the
trashbags
that
were
in
front
of
the
residents'
garage,
were
located
in
the
public
street
in
front
of
the
garage,
that
that
trash
collector
on
each
instance
not
mingle
or
mix
the
bags
with
other
trash
in
his
truck
and
that
he
bring
those
bags
down
the
block
to
the
investigator,
which
he
did.
the
investigator
in
each
of
these
two
instances
returned
to
the
police
department
with
those
trashbags
and
examined
the
contents.
on
each
occasion,
items
were
found
including
drug
residue
and
based
on
that,
two
separate
search
warrants
were
issued
for
that
residence
in
laguna
beach.
the
california
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
trial
court's
dismissal
of
the
drug
possession
for
sale
charges
against
the
respondents
that
were
based
on
drugs
found
in
the
house
during
the
search
warrants
on
the
basis
that
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
warrantless
trash
searches.
the
state
respectfully
asks
this
court
to
reverse,
in
accordance
with
an
inconformity
with
the
rulings
of
ten
federal
circuit
courts
of
appeals,
the
first,
the
second,
the
third,
the
fourth,
the
fifth,
the
sixth,
the
seventh,
the
eighth,
the
ninth
on
a
case
from
california,
and
the
eleventh,
all
of
which
have
held
that
warrantless
trash
searches
of
discarded
garbage
placed
in
an
area
accessible
to
the
public
for
collection
is
not
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
additionally,
in
the
case
before
the
court,
there
is
a
factor
that
it
was
not
the
police
who
on
site
examined
the
trash
but
rather
the
trash
collector
at
their
request
obtained
the
trash.
it
is
our
further
position,
the
state's
position
in
that
circumstances
that
the
trash
collector
is
an
agent
of
the
police
when
he
picks
it
up,
but
that
the
situation
of
trash
voluntarily
turned
over
to
a
third
party,
here
the
regulator
trash
collector,
even
where
he's
an
agent
or
acting
at
the
request
of
the
police
bestows
no
reasonable
or
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
on
the
homeowner,
it
is
rather
a
case
of
misplaced
trust.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
first,
that
issue
has
never
been
raised
below,
nor
cast
upon
by
the
california
court,
either
the
trial
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
nor
was
it
raised
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
hearing
in
the
california
supreme
court,
which
was
denied.
additionally,
california's
exclusionary
rule,
which
was
adopted
in
1955,
is
a
rule
of
judicial
creation,
it's
a
judicial
remedy
rather
than
a
constitutional
right,
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
california's
decision
by
constitutional
amendment
in
1982
to
reduce
what
had
become
a
very
large
increased
broader
protection
under
search
and
seizure
to
those
confines
of
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
rise
to
a
federal
constitutional
issue.
additionally,
the
respondent
particularly
greenwood
argues
that
this
court
in
deciding
what
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
is
must
look
to
the
individual
state
law,
and
the
state
suggests
that
that
argument
should
be
rejected.
while
clearly
the
state
may
require
a
higher
or
broader
standard
of
protection
than
the
federal
constitution
requires,
the
state
in
doing
that
would
not
be
applying
fourth
amendment
law,
and
i
would
submit
that
this
court
would
not
be
applying
fourth
amendment
law
if
it
took
the
state's
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
found
itself
bound
by
that
in
concluding
what
the
fourth
amendment
is
for
the
entire
nation.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
no.
i
would
respond
to
that,
your
honor,
that
the
state
would
be
free
to
do
that
but
they
would
be
interpreting
their
constitution
in
imposing
a
broader
protection
than
the
more--
mr.
michael
j.
pear
--under
the
state
law,
but
i
would
submit
that
it
would
not
be
a
legitimate
expectation
under
the
fourth
amendment.
in
that
event,
the
state
would
be
instructing
this
court
what
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
or
does
not
prohibit.
in
a
situation
which
is
not
uncommon
before
this
court,
where
you
have
cases
involving
the
same
issue
from
two
or
three
states
at
one
time,
you
would
end
up,
i
would
think,
in
the
uncomfortable
situation
if
you
had
a
case
from
a
state
such
as
california.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
i
would
think
that
community
standards
have
been
determined
by
this
court
to
be
an
appropriate
method
of
dealing
with
area
obscenity,
but
counsel
cites
no
cases,
and
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
say
you
would
have
a
community
standard
of
fourth
amendment
rights,
or
a
community
standard
of
miranda
rights,
fifth
amendment
rights.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
well,
taking
this
court's
analysis
that
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
involves
a
two
part
analysis,
now
the
subjective
expectation
of
citizens
might
vary
from
community
to
community,
it
might
vary
among
the
residents
of
a
single
household.
but
as
to
what
constitutes
what
this
court
has
termed
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
determined
by
either
the
concepts
of
property
law
or
the
general
principles
that
society
recognizes,
i
would
submit
that
has
to
be
a
national
standard.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
i
don't
think
the
issue
is
objective
reasonableness
in
determining
under
fourth
amendment
what
is
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
the
person
may
subjectively
entertain
that
belief,
but
i
don't
believe
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
belief
is
reasonable.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
your
honor,
with
regards
to
adopt
what,
a
case?
because
california's
view
is
based
on
a
1971
4
to
3
case.
it's
not
a
statute
that
says
your
garbage
is
protected
even
though
you've
thrown
it
away.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
certainly.
but
if
many
of
the
states
had
adopted
such
a
view
or
adopted
such
a--
mr.
michael
j.
pear
--as
the
opinion
by
this
court
in
rickus
indicated,
you
don't
just
look
to
fourth
amendment
cases
to
decide
what
fourth
amendment
is.
but
i
would
concede
that
it
would
be
suggested
to
the
court
that
society
generally
recognizes
this
type
of
expectation
if
most
states
entertained
that
view.
conversely,
in
the
case
at
bar,
most
states
and
every
federal
circuit
court
of
appeal
that
has
considered
the
issue
have
concluded
quite
the
opposite,
that
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
once
you
have
relinquished
possession,
control,
made
that
unequivocal
by
placing
it
in
an
area
accessible
to
the
public.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
i
believe
those
are
not
mutually
exclusive,
your
honor.
certainly,
i
think
the
katz
analysis
is
the
analysis
to
apply.
but
in
looking
at
that,
the
concept
of
abandonment
isn't
irrelevant.
the
fact
that
in
a
property
sense,
the
items
are
thrown
away
is
a
significant
factor
in
deciding
whether
there
is
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
and
i
think
the
state
contends
that
the
federal
cases
that
we've
cited
to
the
court,
as
well
as
the
state
cases,
apply
a
katz
analysis,
but
in
looking
at
the
legitimacy
of
an
expectation,
look
at
what
happens
to
that
expectation
with
regards
to
something
you've
thrown
away.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
i
think
it
is
part
of
the
test.
i
don't
think
abandonment
in
a
property
sense
is
the
start
and
end
of
the
analysis
under
katz.
but
i
think
under
katz,
the
property
concept
is
something
you
take
into
consideration.
and
i
submit
when
you
do
that,
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
courts
that
have
considered
the
issue
have
come
to.
that
is
that
you
have
abandoned
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
which
you
have
abandoned.
there's
also
a
suggestion
in
both
respondent's
briefs
that
there
is
an
element
of
harassment
if
the
police
are
free
without
a
warrant
or
without
probable
cause
to
conduct
warrantless
trash
examinations.
first,
i
think
the
record
in
the
court
below
does
not
sustain
that
claim.
before
i
get
to
those
items
of
the
transcript
and
record
which
i
think
negate
any
type
of
harassment,
it's
the
state's
position
that
where
there's
no
expectation
of
privacy,
thus
an
intrusion
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
implication,
the
fact
that
such
an
intrusion
occurred
more
than
once
or
twice
or
three
times
does
not
now
collectively
add
up
to
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
if
there
is
in
some
future
case
an
establishment
by
an
individual
that
he
has
been
subject
to
some
type
of
harassment
but
not
a
fourth
amendment,
he
has
an
adequate
civil
remedy
to
prevent
that.
further,
i
would
suggest--
mr.
michael
j.
pear
--thank
you.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
furthermore,
in
answer
to
the
fear
that
the
respondents
express
that
trash
searches
without
a
warrant
would
result
or
could
result
in
harassment,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
nature
of
trash
examination
itself
provides
inherent
in
it
a
limitation.
the
undesirability
of
the
chore
itself
limits
the
number
of
times
or
circumstances
under
which
police
will
make
such
an
examination.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
it's
certainly
not
a
volunteered-for
duty,
i'd
assure
you.
also,
with
regard
to
the
suggestion
that
the
record
shows
that
there
were
months
of
monitoring
of
the
trash,
i
think
that's
based
on
a
misreading
of
a
portion
of
the
clerk's
transcript
referred
to
by
respondents
at
page
112
and
page
113.
the
question
which
confused
the
investigator
was
whether
you
had
occasion
to
do
this
over
this
period
of
time,
and
i
submit
read
in
conjunction
with
two
other
areas
of
her
testimony,
it
is
clear
that
she
understood
the
word,
occasion,
as
could
you
have
or
did
you
have
the
opportunity,
as
opposed
to
did
she
in
fact
make
such
examinations.
on
page
84
of
the
clerk's
transcript,
investigator
strassner
testified,
it
was
only
one
or
two
weeks
before
april
6th
that
she
learned
when
trash
was
collected.
additionally,
at
page
122
of
the
clerk's
transcript,
she
indicates
the
total
number
of
times
of
surveillance
at
the
residence
before
the
april
6th
date
was
three
to
four
times,
and
the
affidavit
that
is
part
of
the
joint
appendix
starting
at
page
37
shows
that
at
least
two
of
those
surveillances
were
late
at
night,
early
morning,
when
it
was
surveillance
for
the
purpose
of--
mr.
michael
j.
pear
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
as
to
the
issue
of
fourth
amendment.
finally,
with
regard
to
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
this
morning
regarding
looking
at
state
law,
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
oregon
v.
haas
at
page
720,
the
material
covered
by
footnote
4.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i've
concluded.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
if
the
court
has
any
questions,
i'll
be
glad
to
respond.
otherwise,
the
state's
prepared
to
submit.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
on
whether
the
person
could
be
stopped?
mr.
michael
j.
pear
would
have
no
lawful
authority
to
stop
the
person.
mr.
michael
j.
pear
that's
correct.
in
the
people
v.
grey
case
that
i
cited
i
believe
in
opening
brief
involves
where
the
trash
collector
himself
looks.
