justice
scalia
what
about
private
suit,
could
there
be
a
private
suit
against
the
person
who
conducted
the
search
in
violation
of
california
law?
justice
scalia
yes,
a
civil
damage
suit.
justice
scalia
oh,
i
understand
you
may
not
win
it
but
the
suit's
available
so
we
wouldn't
have
been
making
a
dead
letter
of
the
california
law.
justice
scalia
but
that's
california's
problem.
i
mean,
at
this
point
we're
not
talking
about
a
federal
law
anymore,
we're
talking
about
a
california
law.
and
if
that
is
not...
we
will
not
have
voided
it
completely
and
if
california
thinks
it
needs
more
teeth,
california
can
give
it
more
teeth.
justice
scalia
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
this
argument.
mapp
involved
the
violation
of
a
federal
constitutional
right.
justice
scalia
correct.
and
we
said
that
the
state
courts
would
have
to
enforce
that
violation
of
a
federal
constitutional
right
by
the
exclusionary
rule?
justice
scalia
now,
you're
saying
that
it
follows
from
that
that
the
state
courts
also
as
a
federal
constitutional
matter,
must
enforce
the
violation
of
any
state
constitutional
right
by
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
the
federal
courts
have
to
do
the
same.
justice
scalia
i
don't
see
how
the
one
follows
from
the
other.
justice
scalia
it
is
our
business
to
enforce
the
federal
law.
it's
not
our
business
to
enforce
the
state
law.
justice
scalia
why
not.
wouldn't
that
satisfy
me
you're
just
talking
about
the
due
process
clause
here,
and
why
wouldn't
that
be
enough?
justice
scalia
you
don't
have
any
dogs
in
california?
i
don't
know,
you
people
just
don't
suffer
from
many
of
the
problems
that
we
suffer
back
in
the
east,
apparently.
we
used
to
have
dogs
that
used
to
get
into
those
things.
justice
scalia
so
you're
pretty
risky
to
leave
something
out
on
your
curb
in
an
opaque
bag
whether
there
are
dogs
around,
anyway.
