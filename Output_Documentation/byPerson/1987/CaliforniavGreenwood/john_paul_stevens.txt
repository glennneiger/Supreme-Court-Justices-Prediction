justice
stevens
say
they
didn't
do
it
as
a
matter
of
constitutional.
let's
say
the
legislature
passed
a
statute
says
as
a
declaration
of
california
policy,
we
think
people
ought
to
have
a
privacy
interest
in
their
garbage,
and
so
we
instruct
our
police
officers
not
to
search
garbage.
could
the
people
in
california
develop
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
based
on
such
a
statute.
justice
stevens
well,
we
say
some
things
are
obscene
in
california
and
not
in
other
states.
we
follow
local
community
standards
in
some
areas.
why
isn't
privacy
sort
of
like
what
offends
people,
different
views
in
different
parts
of
the
country.
justice
stevens
well,
i
agree,
but
the
question
here
is
whether
there's
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
every
american
citizen
must
have
the
same
expectation
or
is
it
possible
that
there
could
be
different
expectations
in
different
parts
of
the
country.
that's,
as
you
say,
it's
a
new
question.
i've
never
thought
of
it.
justice
stevens
most
property
concepts
we
turn
to
state
law
to
define,
and
what
could
be
more
legitimate
than
a
state
statute
in
terms
of
objective
reasonableness
of
the
standard?
justice
stevens
but
mr.
garey,
you're
arguing
mainly
from
procedural
due
process
cases,
vitek
v.
jones.
i
don't
suppose
you're
arguing
that
the
homeowner
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
the
garbage
is
searched
are
you?
justice
stevens
no.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
are
there
some
california
cases
that
say
that
the
trash
search
is
all
right
provided,
sort
of
like
an
automobile
search,
you
have
to
have
probable
cause
for
it
even
though
you
don't
have
a
warrant.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one?
what
is
the
answer
to
justice
marshall's
question?
justice
stevens
as
a
matter
of...
what's
your
view
as
a
matter
of
california
law?
justice
stevens
he
would
not
have
any
authority
so
that
in
california
law,
the
neighbor
can
go
in
and
look
through
the
garbage?
