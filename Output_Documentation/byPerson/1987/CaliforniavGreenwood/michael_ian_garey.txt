mr.
michael
ian
garey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
preceding
somewhat
backwards
from
how
i'd
intended
to
proceed,
i
think
i
would
like
first
if
i
may
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
appropriateness
of
arguing
the
due
process
claim
in
this
court.
there
are
several
different
aspects
of
this
which
i
think
dictate
that
the
issue
should
be
addressed
on
its
merits
by
this
court,
not
the
least
of
which
are
the
circumstances
that
were
existing
at
the
time
this
matter
was
argued
in
the
municipal
court,
in
the
superior
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
california
for
a
period
of
over
fifteen
years,
stare
decisis
had
dictated
that
searches
essentially
identical
to
the
one
in
this
case
were
unlawful.
much
of
our
discussion,
virtually
all
of
our
discussion
revolved
around
concepts
of
stare
decisis
and
so
there
was
no
need
at
those
court
levels,
and
i
repeatedly
stressed
that
at
those
court
levels,
there
is
no
need
to
get
into
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
state
law
issue.
however,
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
to
say
that
the
state
law
issue
was
waived.
indeed,
the
state
law
issue
was
raised
in
the
municipal
court,
although
tersely.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
all
right.
the
state
law
issue,
and
i'll
perhaps
get
into
this
a
little
deeper
on
the
merits
in
a
moment,
but
the
state
law
issue
itself
is
article
i,
section
13
of
the
california
constitution
provides
for
protection
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
article
i,
section
1
provides
for
a
right
of
privacy
which
is
described
as
inalienable.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
that
is
correct.
and
that's
exactly
what
i
mean
by
the
state
law
issue.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
oh,
yes.
yes.
the
argument
centered,
and
i
think
this
is
abundantly
clear
from
the
transcript,
the
argument
in
the
municipal
court
centered
around
the
fact
that
krivda
in
its
second
opinion
on
remand
had
decided
that
the
original
decision
was
based
on
both
state
and
federal
grounds.
and
i
repeatedly
emphasized
that
at
the
municipal
court
level.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
it
would
be
reviewable
here
under
michigan
v.
long
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
question
is
posed.
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
the
federal
question
is
posed
but
it
is
not
posed
entirely
by
itself.
and
i
think
if
i
may
go
back
just
a
little
bit
and
explain
what
i
mean
by
that
because
we
get
into
a
number
of
problems
with
that.
first
of
all,
krivda
originally
was
decided
before
michigan
v.
long.
i
don't
think
that
anybody
has
seriously
contended
it,
and
if
they
do,
i'm
prepared
to
address
it
but
i
don't
think
anybody
has
seriously
contended
that
krivda
was
not
also
decided
upon
independent
state
grounds.
indeed,
this
court
seems
to
have
recognized
that
fact,
at
least
the
dissent
of
this
court
seems
to
have
recognized
that
fact
in
california
v.
rooney
quite
recently.
i
don't
think
that
we
need
to
get
into
an
extended
analysis
of
would
the
original
krivda
opinion
have
survived
a
michigan
v.
long
analysis.
and
i
note
that
in
a
footnote,
petitioner
has
sort
of
alluded
to
that
problem,
although
not
really
briefed
it
in
any
detail.
so
the
answer
to
the
court's
question
i
believe
is
as
simple
as,
yes,
there
is
a
federal
question
posed
in
the
sense
that
part
of
krivda
rested
on
federal
grounds.
there
is
an
independent
state
ground
clearly
presented
because
krivda
in
addition
relied
on
its
own
independent
state
grounds.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
well,
if
i
may
proceed
just
a
little
bit,
because--
mr.
michael
ian
garey
--thank
you
very
much.
the
state
law
issue
and
the
due
process
argument
which
i
make
in
this
court
was
specifically,
although
again
very
tersely
raised
at
the
superior
court
level
in
the
argument
on
the
section
995
motion.
that
would
be
reporter's
transcript
at
page
16
where
i
pointed
out
that
we
are
specifically
not
waiving
article
i,
section
13,
and
that
we
are
relying
in
part
on
the
rationale
that
article
i,
section
28(d)
which
did
away
with
the
state's
exclusionary
rule,
was
violative
of
the
principle
in
mapp.
that
is
the
germ
of
the
argument
that
i
make
at
this
point.
it
was
made
tersely
and
i
will
concede
that
it
was
made
very
tersely
because
the
state
of
the
law
in
california
at
the
time
this
matter
was
going
through
the
municipal
court,
the
superior
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
was
stare
decisis.
either
analysis
you
took,
stare
decisis
came
up
at
the
same
point.
as
far
as
raising
this
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
a
federal
question
at
this
point
seems
to
me
to
be
raised
on
two
different
fronts.
there
is
the
federal
question
that
is
posed
to
this
court
relating
to
whether
or
not
the
trashcan
search
as
indicated
in
this
case
or
as
based
on
the
facts
in
this
case
violates
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
straight
fourth
amendment
issue
itself
in
the
purest
sense,
and
that
is
squarely
presented
to
this
court.
but
there
is
another
federal
question
i
think
that
is
raised
as
well.
the
problem
in
california
is
not
that
the
search
under
california
law
was
lawful,
because
under
california
law
the
search
was
unlawful.
the
problem
is
by
reason
of
the
adoption
of
article
i,
section
28(d),
california
courts
are
without
power
to
cure
or
correct
or
remedy
or
deter,
more
appropriately,
even
an
intentional
and
a
willful
violation
of
state
constitutional
rights.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
i'm
sorry.
could
the
court
repeat
the
question.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
no,
actually
it
would
not.
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
the
real
analysis
that
applied
in
that
situation
is
that
under
california
law,
this
search
in
this
present
case
would
be
as
illegal
today
as
it
was
in
say
1973
or
1980,
but
the
problem
is
that
exactly,
just
exactly.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
the
evidence
would
come
in.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
that
is
also
correct.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
you
mean
like
a
civil
damage
suit?
mr.
michael
ian
garey
the
problem
with
that
is
exactly
i
think
it
is
addressed
in
mapp
originally.
although
mapp
doesn't--
mr.
michael
ian
garey
--but
as
a
matter
of
what
rule
this
court
ought
adopt
under
these
very
historically
unique
circumstances
and
i
will
address--
mr.
michael
ian
garey
--the
problem
is
this.
in
adopting
mapp,
this
court,
even
in
view
of
the
progeny
of
mapp
which
has
laid
more
and
more
stress
on
the
deterrence
rationale,
even
in
view
of
that
and
perhaps
even
more
because
of
that,
the
result
so
long
as
mapp
is
viewed
as
good
law
and
is
constitutionally
compelled
through
the
due
process
clause,
i
think
the
question
that
need
be
posed
is
that
of
whether
or
not
california
or
any
state
for
that
matter
may
define
a
right
as
fundamental
or
as
inalienable
and
refuse
any
effective
remedy
or
any
effective
enforcement
for
it.
to
say
that
there
are
civil
suits
possible
is
the
same
argument
that
was
made
in
the
interim
period
between
wolfe
v.
colorado
and
mapp
v.
ohio.
to
the
extent
that
mapp
is
constitutionally
compelled
under
the
due
process
clause,
the
same
analogy
applies
here.
and
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
it
is
a
matter
of
california
law,
and
indeed,
it
is
a
matter
of
california
law
determining
the
scope
of
the
right
of
privacy
as
in
california.
but
the
question
that
it
does
not
answer
and
does
not
even
address
the
question
of
can
california
define
that
right
as
encompassing
say
a
search
like
the
one
in
the
present
case
and
yet
have
no
effective
means,
have
the
court
completely
stripped
of
its
ability
to
use
a
deterrent
effect,
the
analogy
for
mapp
in
order
to
enforce
its
own
constitutional
provisions.
and
the
answer
is
that
if
the
state
is
in
fact
legitimately
even
in
view
of
the
federal
due
process
clause
stripped
of
that
ability,
then
what's
left?
and
by
the
analysis
in
mapp,
what
is
left
is
that
just
as
in
this
case,
the
state,
the
police
are
entitled
to
intentionally
and
deliberately
and
willfully
violate
the
state
constitution
and
the
state
supreme
court
is
absolutely
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it.
if
it
were
not
that
this
raises
the
due
process
clause
issue,
then
indeed
the
underpinnings
of
mapp
itself
become
questionable.
this
court
has
historically
not
exercised
a
general
supervisory
power
over
state
searches
and
seizures
and
so
forth.
the
rationale
behind
mapp
is
that
it
was
compelled
by
the
due
process
clause.
that
same
due
process
clause
i
submit
compels
the
conclusion
that
this
court
use
the
due
process
clause
to
rule
that
california
may
not
define
a
right
as
fundamental
and
inalienable
and
yet
withhold
the
only
thing
that
this
court
has
held
for
many
many
years
at
this
point
is
an
effect
remedy
or
an
effective
deterrent.
this
case
is
in
many
many
ways--
mr.
michael
ian
garey
--correct.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
absolutely.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
essentially,
yes,
but
with
one
qualifier.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
well,
if
i
may.
first,
with
one
qualifier,
the
qualifier
would
be
limiting
it
to
essentially
fundamental
rights
which
the
state
has
already
or
will
find
to
be
fundamental
substantial
constitutional
rights
bearing
on
the
right
of
privacy.
to
the
extent
that
justice
scalia
is
questioning
why
is
it
that
this
follows
from
mapp,
it
is
not
that
the
holding
in
mapp
which
is
indeed
as
the
justice
just
described
it
directed
towards
violation
of
fourth
amendment
federal
law
and
the
federal
right
of
privacy,
it
is
not
that
the
holding
directly
applies.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
the
force,
the
dynamics
behind
mapp
and
why
it
applies
through
the
due
process
clause
as
opposed
to
through
some
non-existent
supervisory
power
that
this
court
would
have
over
the
states
in
general
applies
to
this
situation
equally.
because
if
you're
saying
that
mapp
has
to
apply
through
the
due
process
clause
to
enforce
fourth
amendment
rights
because
that's
the
only
way
that
you
can
insure
that
the
state
police
in
essence
will
respect
the
fourth
amendment
right,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
that
same
due
process
command
to
use
an
exclusionary
rule
applies
to
make
the
state
enforce
its
own
law.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
in
general,
perhaps
not.
however,
as
recognized
by
this
court
in
hewitt
v.
helms
and
also
vitek
v.
jones,
there
the
due
process
clause
recognizes
rights
that
are
created
by
federal
law
and
also
those
that
are
created
under
state
law.
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
state
law,
the
state
constitutional
provisions
create
what
is
utilized
and
i'll
use
the
phraseology
that
comes
out
of
vitek
v.
jones,
whether
or
not
the
state
constitutional
provision
has
created
a
liberty
interest
in
the
citizen
which
the
due
process
clause
will
prevent
the
state
from
arbitrarily
taking
away.
and
that
is
why
it
applies
through
the
due
process
clause
in
such
a
fashion
very
similarly
to
the
way,
not
identically
to
the
way
but
very
very
similarly
to
the
way
that
mapp
v.
ohio
compelled
state
obedience
to
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
the
way
to
underline
why
that
is
so
necessary
is
that
historical
context
of
this
very
case.
it
has
probably
never
happened,
or
at
least
to
my
knowledge,
it
has
never
happened
in
the
history
of
this
country
since
mapp,
that
a
state
has
developed
a
body
of
law
which
we
will
put
under
the
general
rubric
of
independent
state
grounds,
that
respects
certain
rights
of
privacy
in
its
citizens,
and
thereafter
have
the
state
stripped
of
its
ability
to
enforce
that
same
right.
,--
if
we
need
to
see
an
example
of
why
it
is
necessary
that
the
due
process
clause
be
so
applied,
this
case
is
exactly
that
case.
because
for
15
or
16
years
in
california,
krivda
held
sway.
it
was
stare
decisis.
so
much
was
it
stare
decisis
that
at
the
appellate
court
level,
the
state
conceded
that
it
was
stare
decisis
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
power
to
rule
otherwise,
at
least
on
the
fourth
amendment
aspect
of
the
stare
decisis
issue.
as
soon
as
we
have
the
advent
of
article
i,
section
28(d)
there
is
what
can
only
be
described
as
a
willful
and
deliberate
violation
of
state
constitutional
privilege
as
defined
in
the
krivda
cases.
can
it
be
said
that
the
due
process
clause
will
not
protect
those
rights
of
privacy
where
the
due
process
clause
will
in
fact
protect
the
question
of
whether
or
not
for
instance
a
mental
health
patient
is
going
to
be
involuntarily
transferred
to
another
institution,
which
would
be
like
vitek
v.
jones,
for
instance.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
well,
that
is
correct.
on
the
other
hand,
it
has
never
come
to
pass
as
far
as
i
know.
and
the
argument
i
make
now
indeed
is
a
novel
one,
and
i
could
not
find
a
case
where
anybody
had
raised
precisely
the
issue
that
is
raised
here.
and
i
think
that's
not
because
it
is
not
a
valid
argument.
it's
because
historically
it
has
never
occurred,
the
circumstance
that
we
have
here.
and
yes
it
is
indeed
true
that
this
court
has
made
certain
rulings
on
the
question
of
open
fields
which
are
inconsistent
with
the
rulings
in
california,
both
prior
and
subsequent
to
this
court's
holding,
i
might
add.
the
rule
that
i
would
suggest
now
would
in
fact
operate
i
think
and
there
is
a
concern
on
this
subject,
but
it
would
in
fact
operate
in
such
a
way
that
if
california
as
a
matter
of
interpreting
article
i,
section
13
and
article
i,
section
1
says
that
an
open
field
search
is
more
restricted
than
this
court
in
its
holdings
has
indicated
then
should
this
court,
should
this
court
impose
on
california
the
necessity
of
utilizing
the
exclusionary
rule.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
really
comes
from
turning
the
question
only
slightly,
and
i
mean
very
slightly.
and
the
question
is
should
this
court
allow
any
state
to
define
a
right
privacy
as
being
inalienable
or
fundamental
and
be
able
to
effectively
take
it
away
by
not
enforcing
it,
and
by
allowing
its
state
officers
to
deliberately
violate
the
state
constitution.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
because
the
state
of
california
at
this
point
is
powerless,
and
it
is
powerless
by
reason
of
article
i,
section
23(d).
they've
lost
their
exclusionary
rule.
because
they've
lost
their
exclusionary
rule,
they
have
lost
the
right
or
the
ability--
mr.
michael
ian
garey
--i
never
suggested
that
it
was
an
accident.
the
question
is
does
it
involve
due
process
considerations.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
as
applied
to
this
case,
yes.
not
in
general.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
all
cases
sufficiently
like
it
where
somebody
couldn't
come
up
with
a
good
distinction,
yes.
there
are
a
lot
of
different
parts
to
article
i,
section
28(d).
one
of
the
arguments
that
was
initially
made
to
article
i,
section
28(d)
is
that
it
violated
the
single
subject
rule.
how
aware
the
voters
were
of
this
specific
provision
and
how
it
would
work
is
a
matter
of
some
speculation.
certainly
some
of
the
literature
surrounding
proposition
8
before
it
was
passed
would
have
put
people
on
notice.
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
designated
the
victims'
bill
of
rights
and
it
was
not
exactly
designated,
redefinition
of
constitutional--
mr.
michael
ian
garey
--probably
relatively
little.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
it
is
only
an
answer
to
the
question
of
the
people
of
the
state
altered
the
rule.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
they
did,
and
the
net
effect--
mr.
michael
ian
garey
--very
well,
then
the
answer
is,
yes,
but
the
question
then
still
remains
is
can
any
state,
whether
through
its
electorate,
through
its
legislature
or
through
its
executive
branch
take
away
a
right
that
the
state
has
granted.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
exactly,
exactly.
and
i
think
i
can
focus
this
point
fairly
simply
by
pointing
out
this:
had
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
done
away
with
completely
as
in
repealed
article
i,
section
13
and
article
i,
section
1,
that
would
probably
take
the
argument
that
i
am
dealing
with
now
take
it
away
completely
and
make
it
completely
inapplicable.
the
problem
is
that
they
did
not,
and
the
problem
is
that
what
they
did
is,
they
left
the
right
intact,
the
substantive
right
intact
but
took
away
any
effective
remedy.
and
that
i
think
creates
a
due
process
issue
where
it
might
not
otherwise
be.
and
it
is
analogous
to
the
situation
where
the
state
has
no
obligation
whatsoever
to
have
say
parole
but
it
does
have
an
obligation
to
satisfy
federal
due
process
in
how
it
deals
with
parole.
and
so
i
think
that
the
analogy
is
very
tight
and
it
is
very
tight
especially
if
one
views
the
rationale
behind
mapp
v.
ohio.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
no.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
i'm
not.
however,--
mr.
michael
ian
garey
--well,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
a
hearing
before
the
garbage
is
searched,
is
that
the
question?
all
right,
i
think
that
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
any
search
whatsoever,
and
i
might
indicate
too,
that
it
is
not
our
suggestion
and
it
is
not
my
argument,
either
as
a
matter
of
fourth
amendment
law
or
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
that
a
trash
search
is
illegal
in
every
case.
it
is
illegal
when
there
is
no
probable
cause
and
there
is
no
warrant
or
there
is
no
exigent
circumstance
excusing
the
use
of
a
warrant.
in
this
case
the
people
eschewed
at
the
trial
court
level
any
theory
that
they
were
going
on
probable
cause
or
exigent
circumstances,
and
so
the
question
is
squarely
presented.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
there
is
suggestion,
and
it's
dicta,
but
there
is
suggestion
in
that,
and
indeed,
that's
a
matter
that
the
state
court
can
address
itself
to.
and
i
suppose
that
in
view
of
the
political
shift
in
california,
there's
always
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
california
will
redefine
the
fundamental
nature
of
privacy
as
it
bears
on
cases
like
this
one.
that
is
a
state
court
function.
the
due
process
clause
i
think
becomes
involved
only
to
the
extent
that
they
continue
to
recognize
the
right
but
withhold
the
remedy.
and
i
would,
if
i
may,
on
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
distinction
between
substantive
due
process
or
procedural
due
process
here,
it
is...
and
i
realize
that
in
cases
like
vitek
v.
jones,
what's
really
being
discussed
is
the
procedures
by
which
the
right
is
taken
away.
but
the
shift
in
emphasis
in
this
court
since
mapp
in
terms
of
what
is
the
rationale
for
mapp
v.
ohio,
and
why
is
it
necessary,
it
has
put
it
in
the
rubric
of
a
procedural
necessity.
it
is
not
an
integral
part
necessarily
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
it
is
a
procedural
necessity,
without
it,
there's
no
way
of
enforcing
the
fourth
amendment.
and
so
we're
talking
about
procedure
in
both
senses.
we're
talking
about
the
procedure
by
which
the
state
takes
away
a
right
in
the
sense
that
it
was
used
in
vitek
v.
jones.
we
were
also
talking
about
the
procedure
by
which
the
state
either
enforces
or
by
not
enforcing
takes
away
the
right
of
privacy
in
this
case,
too.
and
if
there
could
be
any
question,
can
there
be
any
question
of
the
necessity
for
the
deterrent
effect
of
an
exclusionary
rule,
i
think
the
fact
that
we're
here
some
many
many
years
after
the
opinion
in
krivda
answers
that
fairly
squarely.
in
terms
of,
and
i'll
return
just
briefly
to
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
did
pose,
which
is
the
raisability
of
this
issue,
as
i'd
indicated,
essentially
this
argument
was
raised
in
the
superior
court
without
objection
by
the
state
whatsoever.
the
state
did
not
request
in
their
brief
that
this
court
not
address
the
merits
of
this,
although
there's
a
passing
reference
to
the
timing
of
the
raising
of
this
issue.
the
passing
reference
is
not
entirely
accurate
factually
as
the
record
would
indicate,
if
one
looks
at
reporter's
transcript,
page
16.
the
issue
is
also
purely
one
of
law,
and
it
is
purely
one
of
federal
law.
and
this
court
clearly
has
the
discretion
under
its
own
holding
in
singleton
v.
wolfe
to
entertain
the
merits
of
the
issue.
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
do
so,
particularly
since
it
presents
a
substantial
issue
of
constitutional
principle.
now,
if
i
may
address
briefly
the
question
of
the
trash
search
itself,
and
i
address
it
here
not
just
a
question
of
state
law
as
we've
been
discussing
for
the
last
several
minutes,
but
rather
as
either.
should
it
be
included
within
the
concept
of
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
in
part,
the
question
i
think
can
be
posed
why,
as
in
why
should
this
court
extend
or
apply...
which
i
think
is
perhaps
a
better
term...
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
to
opaque
plastic
trashbags
placed
out
at
the
curbside
for
collection.
the
issue
breaks
down
in
my
mind
at
least
to
almost
a
why
and
a
why
not,
and
it
is
almost
the
latter
aspect
of
it
which
seems
to
be
the
most
important,
or
at
least
it's
the
most
revealing.
on
the
primary
question
of
why,
it
is
fairly
clear,
and
i
think
even
the
dissent
in
rooney
recognized
that
many
people
put
all
sorts
of
things
that
reveal
their
lifestyle
that
are
secrets
that
are
private
in
their
trash.
if
you
lay
it
out
on
the
sidewalk
not
in
an
opaque
bag
so
that
anybody
passing
by
can
see
it,
i
suppose
there's
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
if
it's
put
in
an
opaque
container,
especially
under
the
circumstances
involved
in
this
case
where
it
is
to
be
picked
up
by
the
trash
man,
it
is
to
be
put
in
the
trash
truck
and
within
seconds,
and
the
record
here
i
think
demonstrates
that,
within
seconds
of
it
being
picked
up
by
the
trashman,
ordinarily
the
mixing
part
of
the
garbage
truck
would
mix
it
in
with
all
the
other
trash,
and
it
would
become
essentially
lost
forever.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
we
have
dogs,
and
i
suppose
we
have
snoops
and
i
suppose
we
have
all
sorts
of
private
agencies
that
might
interfere
with
somebody's
otherwise
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
i
suppose--
mr.
michael
ian
garey
--it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
in
this
case,
and
really
in
any
of
the
cases
that
i've
read
about
including
i
think
it's
u.s.
v.
terry
where
the
dea
monitored
somebody's
trash
off
and
on
for
a
period
of
six
months
that
at
no
time
did
the
police
in
this
case
or
the
dea
in
that
case
have
to
fight
this
horde
of
people
that
were
standing
around
the
man's
trash
in
order
to
get
at
it.
to
talk
about
the
mere
possibility
that
a
dog
may
get
at
somebody's
trash
or
that
the
next
door
neighbor
might
come
over
and
get
at
somebody's
trash
it
seems
to
me
avoids
what
is
the
real
question
here.
what
is
the
ordinary
reasonable
expectation
of
any
normal
ordinary
citizen.
the
fact
that
there
might
occur
a
private
intrusion...
what
i
mean
is
a
non-state
action
intrusion
into
the
trash,
whether
it's
by
a
dog
or
by
a
next
door
neighbor
who
wants
to
compile
a
dossier
on
their
neighbor
doesn't
really
answer
the
question.
this
court,
for
instance,
in
jacobsen
and
walters
drew
a
distinction
between
the
private
search
and
the
state
action
type
search
that
involves
governmental
intrusion.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
would
have
been
no
occasion
for
this
court
to
have
looked
into
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
governmental
search
in
relation
to
the
private
search
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
the
private
search
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
issue,
not
because
it's
proper,
not
because
it
doesn't
invade
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
as
to
the
householder,
but
because
it
involves
no
state
action.
and
that's
exactly
why
if
you
have
the
fact
of
a
private
search
that
invades
somebody's
privacy
to
the
extent
that
the
person's
privacy
has
been
breached
by
the
perhaps
unreasonable
but
not
governmental
private
search,
the
court
will
recognize
that
breach,
but
only
to
that
extent
and
only
within
that
scope.
and
i
believe
that
it
was
justice
scalia
in
your
opinion
in
o'connor
v.
ortega
where
the
court
defined
the
question
of
privacy
not
as
a
matter
of
absolute
solitude
but
privacy.
and
so
if
you
put
your
trash
in
opaque
plastic
bags
out
for
collection
reasonably
knowing
that
what's
going
to
happen
is
that
it's
going
to
be
there
for
a
half
an
hour,
maybe
an
hour,
the
trash
guy's
going
to
come
by,
he's
going
to
pick
it
up,
put
it
in
the
trash
truck,
and
the
trash
truck
itself
will
chew
up
all
the
trash
and
stuff
it
in
the
back
with
everybody
else's
trash,
the
fact
that
there
is
some
remote
possibility
that
you
don't
have
100
percent
certainty
that
your
trash
will
not
be
looked
into
by
someone,
would
not
seem
to
have
a
really
significant
impact
on
that
reasonable
expectation.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
can
you
stop
him?
mr.
michael
ian
garey
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
probably
an
invasion
of
your
privacy.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
i
think
that
would
depend
on
the
law
in
the
state
in
particular
as
to--
mr.
michael
ian
garey
--i
should
think
so.
mr.
michael
ian
garey
on
the
basis
that
he's
violating
your
right
of
privacy.
now,
the
question
also,
if
i
may,
would
seem
to
be
could
you
stop
him
and
how
could
you
stop
him.
