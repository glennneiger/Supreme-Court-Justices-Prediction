mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
9
of
the
flood
control
act
of
1944
approved
the
pick-sloan
plan,
a
comprehensive
multiple
purpose
program,
jointly
administered
by
the
army
and
the
interior
department,
for
the
development
of
the
missouri
river
basin's
water
resources.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
secretary
of
the
interior
may
enter
into
a
contract
pursuant
to
the
federal
reclamation
laws
to
supply
a
portion
of
the
program's
unneeded
irrigation
waters
for
etsi
pipeline
project's
state-approved
industrial
use.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
briefly
describing
the
pick-sloan
plan.
pick-sloan
represents
a
comprehensive
yet
flexible
response
to
the
needs
of
a
vast
and
varied
river
basin.
it
combines
the
flood
control
features
of
the
army's
proposed
pick
plan
and
the
reclamation
features
of
the
interior's
proposed
sloan
plan
into
a
unified
inter-agency
program
designed
to
provide
maximum
basin-wide
benefits.
under
this
plan,
the
arid
upper
basin
states
dedicated
a
great
expanse
of
productive
lands
for
construction
of
the
massive
main
steam
reservoirs
that
would
protect
the
lower
basin
states
from
disastrous
seasonal
floods.
in
return,
the
upper
basin
states
received
assurances
that
water
stored
in
these
reservoirs
located
within
their
borders
would
be
available
for
irrigation
and
other
needs.
the
main
stem
reservoirs
have
now
been
completed,
and
the
lower
basin
states
are
secured
from
the
once
devastating
flood
waters,
but
the
upper
basin
states
anticipated
irrigation
needs
have
not
yet
fully
materialized
and
those
states
wish
to
put
this
water
which
presently
inundates
their
territory
to
other
beneficial
applications.
the
dispute
here
centers
on
lake
oahe,
a
main
stem
reservoir
that
was
central
to
both
the
pick
and
the
sloan
plans.
the
army
originally
proposed
two
small
flood
control
reservoirs
at
this
location.
interior,
by
contrast,
recommended
one
large
reservoir
with
much
greater
capacity
to
meet
the
upper
basin
states'
reclamation
needs.
the
army
and
interior
ultimately
agreed
that
interior's
proposal
with
its
massive
reclamation
storage
capacity
would
best
serve
the
needs
of
the
basin.
however,
it
became
clear
in
the
early
1970s
that
the
upper
basin
states'
irrigation
needs
were
not
developing
as
quickly
as
expected.
the
interior
department,
with
the
cooperation
of
the
army,
therefore
agreed
to
market
the
resulting
unneeded
irrigation
water
at
lake
oahe
and
other
reservoirs
for
state-approved
applications.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
have.
this
agreement
has
been--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
army
general
counsel,
at
the
time
that
this
proposal
was
first
made,
indicated
that
the
statute
appeared
somewhat
ambiguous
but,
nevertheless,
agreed
to
cooperate
with
the
interior
department's
proposal,
deferring
to
the
interior
department's
expertise
in
supplying
industrial
water.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
at
the
highest
levels
of
the
army,
with
the
secretary
of
the
army
and
the
general
counsel
of
the
army,
who
are
in
a
position
to
make
these
determinations
under
the
flood
control
act,
there
has
been
substantial
agreement
between
the
two
agencies
throughout
this
program.
the
respondents
cite
several
memoranda,
internal
memoranda,
obtained
through
discovery,
that
express
some
doubts
at
lower
levels.
however,
the
army
general
counsel
has
been
quite
consistent
in
his
approach
to
this
matter
throughout...
since...
essentially
since
1974.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
correct,
also.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
not
necessarily.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
usually
not.
for
instance,
i
would
think
that
the
water
that
now...
the
etsi
contract,
this
particular
20,000
acre
feet
of
water,
would
not
be
treated
as
surplus
water
by
the
army.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
because
it
is
being
put
to
a
use
by
the
interior
department.
it's
being
put
to
a
use
in
accordance
with
the
federal
reclamation
laws.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
the
army's
present
position,
which
is
presently
being
formulated
at
this
point,
it
is
still
under
evolution,
would
be
that
it
would
not
be
able
to
market
the
etsi
water,
and
the
reason
is
this:
let
me
go
back,
first,
to
1974.
the
army
made
a
determination
at
that
point
that
it
probably
could
not
market
unutilized
irrigation
water
in
these
circumstances
because
it
would
run
through
the
hydro-powered
turbines
and
would,
therefore,
serve
a
beneficial
use.
the
army
has
found
that
this
interpretation,
in
fact,
has
resulted
in
some
very
harsh
applications.
in
particular,
with
small
towns,
for
instance,
parshall,
north
dakota,
was
the
example
used
here.
the
town
requested
a
very
small
amount
of
water,
323
acre
feet,
for
its
municipal
uses.
the
town
almost
adjoins
the
reservoir
and
was
in
need
of
water.
the
army's
initial
determination
was
that
perhaps
it
could
not
supply
this
water
because
the
water
could
be
used
to
go
through
the
turbine.
the
army
has
attempted
to
ameliorate
that
policy
by,
in
fact,
making
this
water...
by
concluding
that
when
the
water
can
be
made
available
to
a
municipal
application
without
interfering
with
other
project
purposes,
that
it
then
can
supply
the
water.
this
is
really
what
the
army's
policy
is
designed
for.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they
have
decided
to
treat
that
type
of
water
as
surplus.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
traditionally,
that's
how
the
army
defined
it.
water
that
would,
in
fact,
pass
over
the
spillway,
that
would
not
be
used
for
any
other
purpose.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
in
this
case,
take
the
example
here
where
the
water,
in
fact,
the
water
is
being
used
to
produce
hydro-power,
and
that
is
the
only
purpose
that
this
water
can
serve
at
all.
if,
in
this
case,
a
small
town,
in
this
case,
parshall,
is
willing
to
pay
enough
for
that
water,
in
fact,
recoup
the
lost
hydro-power
purposes,
then
it
fulfills
the
ultimate
objective
of
the
reservoir.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
depends.
it
appears
that
that
was,
in
fact,
what
congress
meant
when,
in
fact,
it
adopted
these
surplus
water
provisions
here
in
the
flood
control
act,
section
6,
that
it
was,
at
that
time,
addressing
these
types
of
problems.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
your
honor,
i
think,
in
any
event,--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
your
honor.
but,
your
honor,
i
think
what's
important
to
remember
here
is
the
army's
authority
is
not
what
is
in
question
here.
instead,
it's
the
interior
department's
authority.
that
is
what
has
been
challenged
and
is
the
subject
of
this
dispute.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
i
think
what
the
two
agencies
have
reached
a
reconciled
position
to,
based
on
their
two
definitions,
that,
in
fact,--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
judge
bright
is
partially
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
army
simply
cannot
market
all
of
the
water
that's
available
in
this
reservoir
as
surplus
water.
it's
simply...
you
must
remember
the
army's
mission
is
primarily
flood
control
and
navigation
protection.
their
supply
of
surplus
water
is
simply
an
ancillary
power
that
has
been
given
to
them
by
congress
to
assure
maximum
utilization
of
these
reservoirs.
congress'
ultimate
objective
in
these
cases
is
to
assure
that
these
reservoirs
do
the
most
good
for
the
most
people.
that
point
is
repeated
throughout
the
legislative
history.
it's
the
guiding
principle
of
the
pick
plan
and
the
sloan
plan,
and
that
is
what
the
army
and
interior
department
are
attempting
to
do
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
it
was
designed
so.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
not
at
the
present.
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
to
make
that
water
available
to
states.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
oh,
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that
at
all.
the
respondents,
the
states,
have
challenged
the
army's
authority
as
well
as
interior's
authority.
in
any
event,
this
authority
was
executed
under
the
interior's
power,
under
the
reclamation
laws.
so,
whether
the
army
signed
the
contract
or
not
is
probably
not
relevant
given
the
authority
that
was
asserted.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but,
in
fact,
they
did
cooperate
here.
in
fact,
the
contract
states
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
the
contract--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
respectfully
disagree
with
you,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
perhaps
it
would
have
been
written
differently.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
correct.
i
think
because...
remember,
the
water
service
contract
was
executed
under
the
reclamation
laws
pursuant
to
a
state
water
right
that
etsi
now
holds.
now,
the
army
is
generally
not
involved
with
the
application
of
the
reclamation
laws
in
these
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
oh,
i
think
there
still
would--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it's
likely
that
there
still
would
have
been
a
lawsuit
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but,
your
honor,
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
secretary
of
the
army
to
sign
these
papers.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
the
contract
even
specifies
that
the
army,
in
fact,
was
consulted
on
this
and
approved
this...
not
approved,
but,
in
fact,--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
that
there
is
legal
significance
because
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
in
terms
of
acting
independently,
i
think
it's
important
to
get
this
point
straight,
and
that
is,
that
under
the
pick-sloan
plan,
the
army
and
interior
constantly
consult
on
all
of
these
matters
because
what
one
does
affects
the
other.
so,
i
think
that
it
is
true
that
there
is
an
obligation
for
consultation
and
coordination.
that
took
place
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
then,
that
can
be
resolved
within
the
executive
branch.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
right.
if
the
secretary
of
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
point.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
every
one
of
those
points
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
agree
completely,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
also.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
the
army
did
sign
our
brief,
but
this
is
primarily--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
what
respect,
your
honor?
the
army
was
sued
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
you
should
take
the
side
of
the
united
states.
we
speak
with
one
voice
in
this
case,
your
honor.
as
i
was
saying,
the
water
marketing
program
advanced
three
important
objectives
in
this
case.
first,
it
permitted
the
upper
basin
states
to
apply
some
of
their
presently
unneeded
irrigation
water
to
other
beneficial
uses.
second,
it
allowed
the
interior
department
to
recoup
some
of
the
costs
incurred
in
providing
irrigation
storage,
and,
third,
it
secured
water
for
alternative
energy
sources
at
the
height
of
the
arab
oil
embargo.
now,
we
submit
that
section
9
of
the
flood
control
act
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
enter
into
the
fc
contract.
our
legal
position
is
quite
straightforward.
section
(a)
of
the
flood
control
act
approves
the
pick-sloan
plan,
which,
in
turn,
designates
the
secretary
of
the
interior
as
the
appropriate
authority
to
manage
the
reclamation
aspects
of
the
main
stem
reservoirs.
section
9(c)
then
identifies
the
body
of
law,
namely
federal
reclamation
law,
that
governs
how
the
secretary
shall
exercise
that
authority.
the
secretary
may,
therefore,
enter
into
contracts
to
supply
unutilized
irrigation
water
from
a
main
stem
reservoir,
in
this
case,
lake
oahe,
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
reclamation
project
act,
a
federal
reclamation
law
that
permits
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
provide
unneeded
irrigation
water
for
miscellaneous
purposes.
there
are
two
points
here
that
bear
special
emphasis.
first,
the
pick-sloan
plan
sets
forth
the
basic
policy
for
the
systematic
development
of
the
river
basin,
and
it
expressly
recognizes
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shall
have
authority
over
irrigation
storage
at
the
main
stem
reservoirs.
it
naturally
follows
under
this
functional
division
of
authority
that
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
administer
the
application
of
irrigation
waters
not
presently
needed
for
irrigation
use.
second,
when
section
9(c)
instructs
that
the
reclamation
developments
to
be
undertaken
by
the
secretary
shall
be
governed
by
the
reclamation
laws,
it
is
referring
to
the
secretary's
reclamation
activities
and
not
merely
the
physical
work
constructed
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
thus,
section
9(c)
makes
clear
that
the
reclamation
laws
shall
govern
the
secretary's
entire
reclamation
program
beginning
with
his
initial
assessment
of
irrigation
storage
requirements,
continuing
through
to
final
repayment
of
costs,
and
including
in
his
determination
what
should
be
done
with
unneeded
irrigation
water.
respondents
have
only
modest
quarrels
with
our
construction
of
section
9.
they
principally
contend
that
two
other
provisions
of
the
flood
control
act,
section
6
and
8,
override
section
9
in
the
functional
division
of
authority
set
forth
in
the
pick-sloan
plan.
the
reply
briefs
filed
in
this
case
explain
in
considerable
detail
why
respondents
are
wrong.
i
will
simply
summarize
our
answer
here.
first,
respondents
observe
that
section
6
gives
the
army
general
authority
to
market
surplus
water
from
army
flood
control
projects.
they
then
surmise
that
the
army
must
have
exclusive
authority
to
market
water
from
the
pick-sloan
program
to
main
stem
reservoirs.
claiming
respondents'
logic
does
not
follow,
section
6
does
not
purport
to
give
the
army
exclusive
water
marketing
authority,
nor
does
it
indicate
how
that
authority
should
be
exercised
in
hybrid
facilities,
which
combine
both
flood
control
and
reclamation
features.
there
is
no
basis
for
interpreting
section
6
to
override
the
functional
division
of
authority
expressly
set
forth
in
the
pick-sloan
plan.
second,
respondents
suggest
that
section
8,
which
specifies
the
general
procedure
for
adding
reclamation
features
to
army
flood
control
projects,
provides
the
only
avenue
by
which
interior
can
exercise
reclamation
responsibilities
at
army
projects.
respondents'
section
8
argument
is
also
untenable.
section
8
deals
with
how
to
add
reclamation
features
to
flood
control
projects.
the
section
has
no
application
here
where
interior
is
attempting
to
assure
that
lake
oahe's
pre-eminent
and
existing
reclamation
feature,
namely
its
massive
irrigation
storage
capacity,
is
optimally
applied
to
a
permissible
reclamation
use.
respondents
also
contend
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
not
entitled
to
deference.
however,
this
is
precisely
the
type
of
case
where
deference
is
appropriate.
first
and
foremost,
the
secretary's
construction
of
section
9
is
certainly
reasonable.
the
most
that
respondents
can
argue
is
the
statute
may
be
ambiguous,
in
which
event
the
secretary's
reasonable
interpretation--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
section
6
and
section
8,
which,
as
i've
indicated,
really
have
no
relevance
here.
they
simply
read
the
wrong
sections
of
the
statute.
they
saw
perfect
plainness
in
the
wrong
provisions.
second,
the
flood
control
act
is
written
in
unusually
broad
language
that
indicates
congress'
intention
that
the
responsible
agencies
would
fill
in
the
gaps
in
this
legislation.
furthermore,
the
interior
department
was
intimately
involved
in
the
formulation
of
this
legislative
program
and
its
interpretations
are,
therefore,
particularly
persuasive.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
contract,
in
essence,
has
been
simply
held
up.
there
are
still
obligations
that
are
owed
by
etsi
under
the
contract,
and
we
continue
to
have
an
obligation
to
provide
that
water.
the
contract
has
been
enjoined.
performance
has
been
enjoined
and,
therefore,
neither
of
these
activities
are
taking
place.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
etsi
has
not
cancelled
the
contract.
they
have
essentially
shelved
their
project,
but
the
contract
remains
a
tangible
asset
of
theirs,
which
they
are
free
to
assign
under
certain
conditions.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
we
do
care
what
they
do
with
the
water.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
water,
they
can
only
apply
the
water
in
accordance
with
a
state
permit.
now,
they
obtained
a
state
permit.
i
believe
the
permit
has
since
lapsed
because
they
are
obligated
to
make
a
very
large
payment.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
we
don't,
your
honor,
but
if
it
went
outside
of
the
terms
of
the
contract,
the
understanding
of
the
contract,
i'm
sure
that
the
secretary
would
object.
we
did
supply
this
water
for
a
particular
purpose
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
is
for
industrial
purposes,
i
believe.
i
think
this
would
be
a
matter
of
really
contract
interpretation.
i'm
not
sure
i'm
well
enough
versed
on
the
contract
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
and,
of
course,
there
would
be
consultation
with
the
army
once
again
about
this.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
believe
that
there
is
an
obligation
for
the
two
agencies
to
consult
in
the
activities
that
take
place
at
the
pick-sloan
reservoirs,
given
the
nature
of
their
hybrid
facilities.
as
i
was
saying
before,
i
think
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
certainly
entitled
to
deference
here,
particularly
because
the
question
here
is
complex
and
requires
specialized
knowledge
of
a
vast
water
resources
program
that
has
been
committed
to
the
care
of
expert
agencies.
furthermore,
the
interior
department
has
consistently
adhered
to
its
present
interpretation
throughout
the
life
of
this
contract
and
to
the
same--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
dispute
would
be
resolved
within
the
executive
branch,
mostly
likely
would
not
be
answered
by
the
courts.
instead,
the
determination
would
be
made
between
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
secretary
of
the
army.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
it
is
because
both
of
those
agencies
ultimately
are
answerable
to
the
president,
and,
in
fact,
when
this
project
was
originally
formulated,
it's
clear
that
president
roosevelt
was
very
active
in
determining
the
hybrid
nature
of
these
facilities.
so,
there
is
an
answer
in
the
executive
branch
for
any
inter-agency
dispute
that
might
exist
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
again,
i
think
as
justice
scalia
mentioned
earlier,
the
contract
was
executed
under
the
reclamation
laws,
after
consultation
with
the
army.
the
army
had
no--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
but
section
6
wasn't
mentioned.
i
think
it's
useful
to
know
exactly--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--what
statutes
these
waters
are
being
applied
because
they
might
have
different
repercussions.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
the
disputes
between
agencies
are
resolvable
within
the
executive
branch,
but
this
is
not
a
dispute
really
between
agencies;
this
is
a
dispute
between
the
upper
and
lower
basin
states
over
the
use
of
this
water.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that's
right,
it
is
not
clear.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm
sorry?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
our
position
is
that
interior
clearly
has
a--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
terms
of
contesting,
i'm
quite
confident
that
we
would
still
have
a
lawsuit
here
today,
your
honor,
even
if
army
had
signed
that
contract.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
question
about
whether
or
not
existing
uses
were
taken
into
account,
under
joint
appendix
page
226,
the
contract
is
set
out,
and
i'd
like
to
read
what
was
said
in
the
contract.
"the
secretary
of
the
interior,
after
consultation
with
the
secretary
of
the
army,
has
determined
that
providing
water
service
for
industrial
use
to
etsi
for
20,000
acre
feet
of
water
annually
will
not
impair
the
efficiency
of
the
product
period,
project
for
irrigation,
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
project
for
flood
control
nor
adversely
affect
existing
uses
of
water,
and
is
a
beneficial
consumptive
use
of
water.
"
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
this
is
on
page
226
of
the
joint
appendix,
paragraph
d.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
next,
i
would
like
to
just
note
some
of
the
incongruities
in
respondents'
position.
if,
in
fact,
section
9(c)
requires
that
physical
irrigation
work
must
be
completed
before
the
secretary
of
the
army--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--indirectly,
it
was,
your
honor.
we
believe
the
consultation
between
interior
and
army
is
necessary
as
part
of
the
pick-sloan
plan,
and
it's
important
to
focus.
the
question
here
is
what
pick-sloan
plan
requires,
which
is
set
forth
in
section
9.
so,
insofar
as
it's
required,
yes,
that
consultation,
we
believe,
is
required,
and
that
is
the
fruit
of
that
consultation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm
not
certain
about
that,
but
i
think
it
might
well
be.
as
i
was
saying,
there
are
certain
incongruities
that
come
from
respondents'
position.
if
section
9(c)
requires
a
physical
irrigation
work
must
be
completed
before
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can
invoke
the
reclamation
laws,
then
the
secretary
could
not
follow
his
standard
practice
of
entering
into
reclamation
contracts
with
irrigators
prior
to
completing
irrigation
works.
notably,
he
entered
into
such
a
contract
here
with
south
dakota's
oahe
conservancy
district
at
the
time
he
initiated
the
construction
of
the
now-suspended
oahe
irrigation
works.
these
works
were
in
progress
at
the
time
that
the
contract,
the
etsi
contract,
was
entered
into.
furthermore,
the
secretary
is
wrong
in
construing
section
9
to
establish
a
functional
division
of
authority
of
these
reservoirs.
in
his
determination
of
hydro-powered
cost
allocations
for
the
entire
midwest,--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
your
honor,
because
those
works...
there
has
already
been
authorization
for
those
works.
this
is
for
adding
irrigation
works
to
flood
control
projects
that
only
have
flood
control
features.
the
sloan
plan
was,
in
fact,
fulfilled.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
exactly.
those
steps
were
followed
in
this
case
at
the
time
the
project
was
authorized.
finally,
there's
some
question
whether
interior's
reclamation
activities
in
pick-sloan,
in
fact,
interior's
quite
active
or
has
been
quite
active
in
participating
in
the
determination
of
reclamation
storage
requirements
here.
it
conducted
extensive
surveys
of
irrigation
needs.
it
entered
into
a
reclamation
contract.
it
secured
water
rights
for
reclamation
purposes.
it
obtained...
it
continues
to
coordinate
its
main
stem
and
tributary
activities
with
the
army.
so,
it's
simply
not
accurate
to
say
that
interior
is
not
active
in
the
oahe
reservoir.
finally,
i
would
like
to
address
the
practical
considerations
that
lie
at
the
very
heart
of
this
dispute.
congress
approved
the
pick-sloan
plan
to
serve
the
needs
of
the
entire
missouri
river
basin.
the
congressionally-approved
plan
was
carefully
formulated
and
coordinated
by
the
corps
and
bureau
engineers
to
provide
a
fair
and
efficient
distribution
of
the
missouri
river
resources
to
all
states
within
the
basin.
the
upper
basin
states
now
seek
a
reasonable
and,
indeed,
a
reasonably
anticipated
benefit
from
their
support
of
the
program.
the
opportunity
to
put
a
portion
of
the
waters
stored
within
these
reservoirs
to
a
beneficial
use.
the
lower
basin
states,
which
already
have
far
greater
water
resources
than
their
northern
neighbors,
show
no
persuasive
reason
for
their
unwillingness
to
share--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
conjunction
with
section
9
of
the
flood
control
act.
the
flood
control
act
gave
interior
responsibility
for
these
reservoirs,
to
exercise
its
authority
under
the
reclamation
laws,
and
this
particular
reclamation
law,
9(c)
of
the
reclamation
project
act,
gives
the
secretary
express
authority
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
to
provide
irrigation...
unneeded
irrigation
water
for
miscellaneous
purposes
as
discerned
throughout
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct.
