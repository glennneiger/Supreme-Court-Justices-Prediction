justice
o'connor
mr.
minear,
have
the
two
agencies,
interior
and
the
army,
always
agreed
consistently
on
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
flood
control
act?
justice
o'connor
there
was
some
suggestion
certainly
by
the
respondents
that
they
have
not
always
agreed
that
the
army
had
maintained
at
one
time
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
could
not
market
water
from
army
reservoirs
independently.
justice
o'connor
well,
has
there
been
some
uncertainty
of
the
position
of
the
two
agencies
in
the
past?
i
have...
apparently
they
have
come
together
for
purposes
of
this
litigation,
but
i'm
trying
to
get
a
candid
assessment
of
what
their
position
was
before.
justice
o'connor
since
i
have
you
interrupted,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
thing.
under
section
6,
now,
the
corps
can
market
surplus
water.
justice
o'connor
now,
unused
irrigation
storage
water
can
be
marketed
by
interior.
justice
o'connor
now,
can
it
be
the
same
water?
what
is
surplus
water
as
opposed
to
unused
irrigation
storage
water?
is
it
the
same
water
we're
talking
about?
justice
o'connor
could
it
be?
could
it
be
the
same?
justice
o'connor
why
not?
justice
o'connor
am
i
mistaken
then
in
thinking
that
the
corps
has
changed
its
position
so
it
now
believes
that
it
could
have
marketed
the
water
in
this
case
as
surplus
water?
justice
o'connor
but
i
thought
etsi
had
cancelled.
justice
o'connor
and
under
this
contract,
the
consideration
to
down
stream
users
was
not
given
because
interior
was
considering
only
irrigation
and
there
wasn't
any
irrigation,
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
okay.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
sg
says
we
look
to
section
9(a),
not
8,
that
8
is
something
else,
and
that
interior
can
proceed
under
section
9(a)
by
administering
reclamation
aspects
of
the
program,
isn't
that
right?
