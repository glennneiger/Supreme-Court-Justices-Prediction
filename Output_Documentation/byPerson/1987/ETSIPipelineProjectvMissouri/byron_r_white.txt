justice
white
well,
wasn't
this...
this
reservoir
was
designed
to
have...
and
built
to
include
irrigation
water?
justice
white
quite
a
lot
of
it.
justice
white
and
the
secretary
of
interior
has
found
that
that
water...
none
of
that
water
or
at
least
all
of
that
water
is
not
needed
for
irrigation.
justice
white
and,
so,
there
the
water
sits
unused
for
irrigation
anyway,
and
your
claim
is,
i
take
it,
that
the
secretary
of
interior
has
the
power
to
use
that
water
for
some
other
purpose.
justice
white
so,
it's
unused
irrigation
water.
justice
white
even
if
the
army
decided
that
it
had
authority
to
execute
a
contract
like
this
on
its
own,
it
would
be
pursuant
to
a
completely
different
set
of
rules.
justice
white
which
is
of
fundamental
importance,
i
would
think.
justice
white
wasn't
even
ambiguous.
i
thought
it
was
so
clear
that
there
was
no
room
for
doubt.
justice
white
but
they
can
only...
they
only
purport
to
reach
that
part
of
a
reservoir's
capacity
that
has
been
set
aside
for
irrigation.
justice
white
i
know,
but
if
the
lake
hadn't
been
built
to
irrigate
also,
it
wouldn't
have
been
built
the
way
it
was.
justice
white
it
was
built
to
have
a
specific
amount
of
irrigation
water
capacity.
justice
white
may
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
i
read
that
it
was
agreed
between
the
two
agencies
that
what
the
capacity
of
the
lake
would
be,
this
reservoir
would
be,
and
that
a
specific
amount
of
it
was
for
irrigation.
justice
white
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
white
let
me
ask
you.
do
you
think
there's
water
available
for
irrigation
in
this
reservoir?
justice
white
and
if
there
was
a
need
for
it,
interior
could
go
ahead
and
sell
it
for
that
purpose?
justice
white
without
anybody's
consent?
i
mean,
without
the
army's
consent?
justice
white
well,
yes,
but
not
army's?
justice
white
they
have
control.
there
is
irrigation
water
in
that
reservoir,
and
interior
has
a
responsibility
for
that
water.
it
says
it
doesn't
need
it
now.
justice
white
right,
exactly.
justice
white
well,
so,
you're
saying...
you're
really
saying,
which
is
not
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
that
interior
would
never
have
any
power
to
sell
any
water
for
industrial
purposes?
justice
white
you
just
said
that.
justice
white
so,
if
they
had
irrigation
works
here,
they
needed
water
for
irrigation
and
they
developed
whatever
works
were
necessary
and
were
using
the
water
for
irrigation
but
they
said,
well,
there's
a
lot
of
other
water
that
could
be
used
for
irrigation,
could
they
sell
that
for
industrial
purposes?
justice
white
well,
that's
a
completely
different
rationale
than
the
court
of
appeals,
which
may
be
quite
right.
justice
white
what
you're
saying
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
interior
has
got
no
power
whatsoever
to
sell
unused
irrigation
water
for
industrial
purposes.
justice
white
exactly,
exactly.
but
it's
got
power
to
take...
to
develop
and
use
that
water
for
irrigation
right
out
of
the
army
reservoir,
and
i
don't
know
that...
and
you
would
say
that
the
only
purpose
that
it
can
divert
water
from
that
reservoir
is
for
irrigation.
that
may
be
right.
justice
white
but
you
certainly
wouldn't
say
that
this
kind
of
a
project
would
be
incidental
to
any
kind
of
irrigation,
would
you?
justice
white
so,
you
do
have
quite
a
different
approach,
and
it
may
be
quite
right.
justice
white
the
solicitor
general
submits.
justice
white
well,
isn't
the
solicitor
general
representing
the
army
here?
justice
white
so,
do
you
question
his
statement
of
what
the
army's
position
is?
justice
white
well,
i
still
don't
understand--
justice
white
--why
if
this
water
is
so
much
under
the
control
of
the
army,
how
would
interior
ever
go
about,
without
getting
army's
consent,
to
utilizing
this
water
for
irrigation?
justice
white
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
i
asked
you
how
would
interior
ever
use
the
water
for
irrigation
without
army's
consent
under
your
position?
justice
white
that
may
be.
so,
that
wouldn't
require
any
thing
from
the
army.
justice
white
so,
you're
telling
me
that
interior
cannot
without
army's
coordination
use
the
water
for
irrigation
purposes.
justice
white
would
you
like
us
to
affirm
or
would
you
like
us
to
embrace
all
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
and
the
reason
for
it,
that
this
is
just
not
a
reclamation
project?
justice
white
mr.
minear,
what
is
your
short
answer
or
is
it
a
long
answer
to
why
section
8
is
not
applicable?
where
it
just
says
that
if
the
secretary
of
interior
decides
that
there's
irrigation
water
available
and
if
the
secretary
determines.
justice
white
and
this
particular
reservoir
was
the
result
of
that
kind
of
a
consultation?
justice
white
well,
is
the
only
basis
for
your
saying
the
interior
has
the
power
to
sell
water
for
industrial
use
that
provision
in
the
reclamation
law
that
says
it
may
sell
for
irrigation
and
miscellaneous
purposes?
justice
white
to
do
what?
justice
white
and
this
industrial
use
is
a
miscellaneous
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
pipeline
case
we
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
opinion
is
unanimous
except
that
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
case.
