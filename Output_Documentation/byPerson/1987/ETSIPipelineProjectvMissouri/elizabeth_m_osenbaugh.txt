ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
here
is
what
law
governs
industrial
use
of
water
stored
in
army
reservoirs
on
the
missouri
river.
respondents
submit
that
the
courts
below
very
properly
held
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
may
not
claim
unilateral
marketing
authority
over
waters
in
army
reservoirs
for
industrial
use.
instead,
section
6
of
the
act
expressly
provides
the
terms
which
govern
industrial
use
of
this
army
reservoir.
section
6
provides
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
makes
the
decision
whether
water
is
available
for
industrial
use
and
section
6
also
very
specifically
protects
other
uses
of
the
water.
it
establishes
the
terms
and
conditions
for
industrial
use
of
water
at
army
reservoirs.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
there
would
be
two
issues
if
the
secretary
of
the
army
had
joined
in
the
contract.
there
would
not
be
the
issue,
i'm
sorry,
of
which
agency
can
market
the
water.
then,
the
question
would
simply
be
whether
the
secretary
of
the
army
complied
with
the
terms
of
section
6.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
then,
the
issue
would
be
the
reasonableness
of
army's
interpretation
of
section
6.
as
is
shown
by
army--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor,
but
i
am
saying
that
section
6
does
impose
substantive
protections
of
other
uses.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
no.
we'd
agree
that
they
would
have
power
to
make
the
decision
whether
to
dispose
of
the
water,
and
the
army
general
counsel's
opinion
indicates
that
army
does
have
authority
to
determine
whether
this
water
is
available
for
industrial
use
and
to
determine
that
a
certain
portion
of
that
water
is
surplus,
even
though
it
may
reduce
the
power
generated
at
the
reservoir.
the
difference,
though,
between
army's
current
position
and
the
position
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
still
quite
significant.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
no,
i
would
not
say
they
had
no
power.
i
would
say
that
provided
that
they
did
reasonably
accommodate
other
project
purposes
and
meet
the
requirements--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--if
they
did
not
adequately
protect
other
uses.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
that
is
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
interior
takes
the
position
that
the
reclamation
projects
act
requires
that
it
not
only...
that
it
need
consider
only
the
effect
on
irrigation
and
not
even
just
the
effect
on
irrigation,
but
only
its
own
irrigation
units.
so,
we
have
challenged
the
adequacy
of
their
consideration.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
there
is
no
specific
block
of
water
set
aside
for
irrigation.
that
is,
the
water
is
in
multi-purpose
storage
where
it
is
used
for
all
the
purposes
that
congress
envisioned.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
that
is
correct.
it
was
built
for
a
variety
of
purposes.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
there
is
no
defined
specific
amount.
it
was
clear
that
congress
contemplated
that
there
would
be
significant
irrigation
development
and
that
the
reservoirs--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--well,
i
don't
believe--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--that
they've
ever
shown
a
specific
amount
for
the
irrigation.
the
agencies
did
agree
and
the
capacity
of
the
reservoir
was
established
in
the
documents
that
coordinate
the
plans.
the
district
courts
specifically
noted
that
the
only
thing,
function,
interior
has
ever
had
at
the
reservoir
was,
other
than
marketing
hydro-power,
which
was
the
power
taken
away,
was
to...
the
language
in
the
senate
documents
indicating
that
the
two
agencies
would
agree
on
the
reservoir
capacity.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
yes,
there
is
water.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
yes.
section
8--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--under
section
8,
for
them
to
develop
any
irrigation
works
to
utilize
the
water,
congressional
authorization
would
be
required.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
for
them
to
construct
the
work,
there
is
an
advanced
determination
requirement
by
army,
but
the
section
8
has
been
construed
to
indicate
that
reclamation
law
and
interior
would
have
irrigation
purposes.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
no,
your
honor.
the
reservoir
was
placed
under
army
control.
the
entire
reservoir
of
the
pick-sloan
plan.
there's
water
in
that
reservoir
which
could
be
used
for
irrigation.
section
8
provides
for
interior
to
carry
out
that
irrigation
function,
and
section
6
provides
for
army
to
carry
out
the
industrial
use
provision.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
so,
interior...
water
could
be
provided
for
irrigation,
but
nothing
in
the
act
or
in
the
pick-sloan
plan
gives
interior
jurisdiction
over
the
block
of
storage
or
for
the
use
of
that
water
for
industrial
purposes.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
no,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
section--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--i
don't
believe
so.
interior
has
no
authority
to
dip
directly
into
the
reservoir
and
say
this
block
of
water
is
under
our
control,
we
are
going
to
divert
that
for
industrial
use.
interior
does
have
authority,
if
the
procedures
in
section
8
are
followed,
to
operate
separate
irrigation
works.
if
it
operates
separate
irrigation
works,
it
has
incidental
powers
under
the
reclamation
law,
including
power
to
provide
water
for
municipal--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--only
if
it
was
incidental
to
the
irrigation
function.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
well,
i...
perhaps
i'm
misunderstanding
the
question
or
misstating
it
because
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
talked
about--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--directly
from
an
army
reservoir
in
the
absence
of
a
work
authorized
by
congress.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
the
question
would
arise
if
interior
had
a
congressionally-authorized
irrigation
work,
as
to
what
incidental
functions
it
could
carry
out
through
that
work,
but
directly
from
the
reservoir,--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--it's
very
unlikely.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
the
significant
difference
between
section
6
and
the
reclamation
law
is
that
section
6
does
protect
other
uses
of
the
water.
congress
placed
the
missouri
river
reservoirs
under
the
control
of
the
secretary
of
the
army
because
of
their
peculiarly-close
relationship
with
flood
control
and
navigation.
that
is,
their
dominant
purpose
was
flood
control
and
navigation
and
not
irrigation,
and
the
water
is
contained
in
multi-purpose
storage
where
it
is
used
for
a
variety
of
purposes,
including
navigation,
flood
control
and
hydro-powered
generation.
because
army
manages
the
reservoir
and
army
has
control
over
all
the
waters
in
that
reservoir,
it
is
the
logical
entity
to
determine
what
water
is
surplus
to
the
functions
and
the
purposes
of
the
reservoir.
interior
carries
out
no
function
at
oahe
reservoir.
it
has
no
interest
in
protecting
other
uses
of
the
water.
additionally,
its
bureau
of
reclamation,
which
is
the
entity
of
the
department
of
the
interior
involved
in
this
case,
has
limited
geographic
reach.
it
has
no
interest
in
the
states
of
iowa,
missouri
or
minnesota,
three
of
the
ten
missouri
basin
states.
by
contract,
it
is
a
national
agency
that
represents
all
interests
in
the
inter-state
river.
it
is
incongruous
to
take
the
position
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
two
agencies
can
market
the
same
water
for
the
same
use,
we're
talking
only
about
industrial
use,
on
different
terms.
it
encourages
form
shopping
for
entities,
such
as
etsi,
that
seek
to
exempt
themselves
from
the
limitations
congress
directly
imposed
in
section
6.
now,
when
etsi
approved
this
contract
in
1982,
it
was
its
first
assertion
of
unilateral
authority
to
market
the
water
and
it
asserted
that
it
would
market
a
million
acre
feet
of
water
annually
for
energy
or
industrial
use
without
further
consideration
of
other
uses.
in
so
doing,
it
relied
on
the
reclamation
law.
it
did
not
rely
on
section
6
or
army
authority
because
army
had
terminated
the
memorandum
of
understanding
by
which
they
had
jointly
provided
a
temporary
solution
from
1975
to
1978.
during
that
time
period,
army
made
a
number
of
statements,
including
one
by
the
secretary
of
the
army,
that
the
memorandum
of
understanding
was
only
a
temporary
solution,
that
there
was
concern
about
statutory
authority,
and
that
modifications
would
be
brought
back
to
congress
if
desired,
and
at
no
time
did
the
agencies
obtain
congressional
approval,
and
army
terminated
the
memorandum
of
understanding.
army
specifically
did
not
approve
the
etsi
contract
under
section
6.
the
court
of
appeals
asked
for
further
information
on
that
point
and
the
federal
defendants
stated
that
army
did
not
approve
the
contract
under
section
6.
it
was
entirely
dependent
upon
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
they
argue
that,
first,
there
is
a
block
of
irrigation
water
and
it's
unutilized
irrigation
water,
but
concede
that
there
is
no
specific
block
of
water
there
that
is
not
under
army
control.
it's
clear
from
the
army
general
counsel's
opinion--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--i
mean,
army
has
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
reservoir
that
this
water
is
contained
in.
it's
clear
from
the
pick-sloan
plan,
army
controls
the
main
stem
reservoir.
it
manages
it
for
all
functions.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
well,
section
8
establishes
the
terms
under
which
interior
utilizes
army
reservoirs
for
an
irrigation
purpose.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
does
not
rely
on
section
8.
they
do
not
contend
that
section
8
would
justify
their
action
here.
in
fact,
they
argue
that...
the
general
sections
of
the
act,
such
as
8,
which
provides
for
the
irrigation
function
at
army
reservoirs,
and
section
6
don't
apply
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
on
the
missouri
river.
and,
so,
their
entire
claim
of
authority
is
certain
statements
and
legislative
history
that
interior
would
adopt
regulations
for
the
use
of
storage
available
for
irrigation
at
army
reservoirs.
however,
congress
specifically
rejected
that
approach
when
it
rejected
the
language
like
that
in
the
house
bill
and
instead
adopted
present
section
8.
so,
section
8
is
limited
to
irrigation
purposes
and
irrigation
works.
army,
however,
physically
operates
the
reservoir
and
it
not...
so,
it
operates
and
has
control
over
all
the
water.
it
doesn't
just
have
jurisdiction
over
surplus
water.
surplus
water
is
the
water
that
can
be
made
available
for
industrial
use.
but
army
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
what
is
surplus
and,
thus,
the
army
has
taken
the
position,
as
is
shown
in
the
1986
general
counsel's
opinion,
that
it
does
have
authority
over
the
water
which
is
stored
in
multi-purpose
storage
in
the
reservoir,
even
though
that
water
would
be
available
for
irrigation,
if
needed.
it
is
not
a
separate
block
that
reclamation
law
controls
this
block
of
storage
in
the
reservoir
and
army
controls
the
rest.
instead,
all
the
water
is
subject
to
army
control
with
section
6
defining
when
the
water
can
be
made
available.
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
concedes
that
in
both
industrial
use
at
this
army
reservoir
and
the
reservoir
itself
and
that
this
water
are
within
the
scope
of
section
6.
section
6
clearly
sets
forth
the
terms
on
which
the
water
can
be
used.
the
army
general
counsel's
opinion
shows
that
it's
a
reasoned
construction,
that
they've
abandoned
the
position
of
the
dissent
below,
that
all
water
would
be
locked
up
and
could
not
be
used
for
any
purpose,
or
even
that
there
would
be
no
water
available
for
industrial
use.
the
current
position
of
the
secretary
of
the
army
is
clear
that
some
water
could
be
made
available
for
industrial
use
at
oahe
under
section
6.
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
act
that
says
that
interior
controls
industrial
use
of
water
at
army
reservoirs.
to
the
contrary.
they
cannot
cite
anything
in
either
the
act
or
the
pick-sloan
plan
that
says--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--because
congress
did
not.
that
language,
that
identical
language,
was
in
section
6
of
the
house
bill.
congress
and
the
conference
committee
rejected
section
6
of
the
house
bill
and
instead
adopted
section
8,
which
speaks
in
separate
irrigation
works
and
irrigation
purposes.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
right.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
well,
all
right.
first,
it's
in
the
transmittal
letters.
it's
not
an
integral
part
of
the
plan
itself
that
was
adopted
by
congress.
second,
even
if
that
section
did
become
law
for
the
missouri
river
and
only
for
the
secretary
of
the
interior's
actions
on
the
missouri
river,
because
they
agreed
that
sections
6
and
8
applied
to
army's
use
of
the
missouri
river,
it
would
only
mean
that
interior
would
adopt
regulations
for
the
use
of
that
storage
for
irrigation
purposes.
army
would
still
operate
the
reservoir.
army
would
still
enter
into
the
contracts.
interior
has
never
adopted
regulations
governing
the
use
of
this
storage.
so
that
interior
has
not
acted
as
if
it
believed
that
that
language
in
the
transmittal
letters
became
law.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
well,
army's
litigation
position
in
this
court
is
only...
is
a
very
guarded
statement
that
interior's
position
is
acceptable
so
long
as
it
does
not
interfere
with
army's
duties.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
well,
i'm
referring
to
the
statements
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
no.
i
was
merely
stating
that
their
description
of
what
army's
position
is
does
not--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--give
us
army's
interpretation.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
they
would
follow
the
procedure
in
section
8.
section
8,
the
act,
does
specifically
provide
for
use
of
army
reservoirs
for
irrigation
purposes.
in
practice,
irrigation
from
the
missouri
river
reservoirs
is
not
pursuant
to
interior
contracts,
but,
instead,--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--well,
i
think
that
section
8
does
provide
the
procedure.
i
think
irrigation
is
clearly
an
authorized
purpose
of
the
reservoir
and
that
under
section
8--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--it
requires
coordination
with
army
because
section
8
begins
with
the
requirement
of
the--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--i
think
that
section
8
establishes
the
procedure.
now,--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--yes,
and
it
is
clear
that
the
pick-sloan
plans
did
contemplate
an
irrigation
purpose.
it
is
clear
that
nothing
in
the
pick-sloan
plan
gives
the
secretary
of
the
interior
authority
over
industrial
use
at
army
reservoirs.
irrigation
clearly
can
be
provided
and
is
not
affected
by
the
issue
in
this
case,
which
involves
industrial
use,
and
section
8
had
been
construed
so
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can...
that
reclamation
law
would
apply
to
irrigation
use
of
army
reservoirs
even
in
the
absence
of
works.
now,
congress
has
rejected
the
applicability
of
the
requirements
of
reclamation
law
even
to
irrigation,
which
undercuts
the
theory
that
reclamation
law
can
be
the
source
of
authority
for
industrial
use.
i
think
it's
clear
that
oahe
can
be
made
available
for
irrigation
use
under
section
8
and
that
industrial
use
is
under
section
6.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
it
is
our
position
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
makes
the
determination
as
to
whether
it
is
surplus
water
and
the
secretary
of
the
army
has,
and
the
army
general
counsel's
opinion
indicates,
that
they
have
determined
that
they
can
define
the
term
"surplus
water"
to
make
water
available
for
industrial
use
from
the
reservoirs.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
yes.
it
is
also
our
position
that
the
term
"surplus
water"
defines
what
water
is
available
for
industrial
use.
it
does
not
limit
the
army's
jurisdiction
over
the
water
for
multiple
purposes.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
on
appeal,
the
contention
has
been
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
it
should
be
paid
into
the
reclamation
fund
and
that
section
6
provides
for
deposit
in
the
treasury
as
miscellaneous--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--it's...
no.
i
would
only
point
out
that
interior
in
discussing
power
revenues,
which
was
a
matter
that
they
clearly
had
authority
over
the
marketing
of
power
at
army
reservoirs
until
'77,
that
they
could
not
find
a
basis
in
the
reclamation
law
to
place
power
revenues
from
the
missouri
river
for
developments
in
the
reclamation
fund
and
that
was
resolved
by
subsequent
congressional
action
that's
not
involved
here.
so,
where
the
money
went
could
not
have
been
a
basis
for
the
congress
in
1944
to
have
decided
whether
interior
could
market
any
of
this
water
for
industrial
use.
there's
amendments
in
the
pick-sloan
plan
regarding
the
utilization
of
reservoirs
for
irrigation
storage
was
specifically
rejected
by
congress,
and
congress
also
rejected
amendments
to
section
6
that
would
have
specifically
given
the
secretary
of
the
interior
authority
over
industrial
use
of
army
reservoirs,
and
at
that
time,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
1944
specifically
stated
in
asking
for
that
authority
that
he
recognized
that
industrial
use
in
section
6
in
no
way
involves
reclamation
but
sought
it
for
purposes
of
administrative
efficiency.
congress
did
not
adopt
those
amendments
to
section
6
and
congress
adopted
the
version
of
section
8
which
gives
interior
authority
over
separate
irrigation
works
and
gives
interior
authority
over
irrigation
purposes
but
not
over
industrial
use.
i
believe
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior's
decision
is
not
entitled
to
deference
because
the
very
question
here
is
what
law
applies
to
industrial
use
at
oahe.
deference
assumes
that
congress
has
delegated
authority
to
the
agency
to
decide
a
question,
and
in
this
case,
that
is
the
issue.
congress
did
not
delegate
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
decision
whether
it
would
be
interior
or
army
or
whether
section
6
would
apply.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
congress
did
address
it
in
section
6.
rather
than
saying
army
and
interior
shall
decide
how
to
run
these
reservoirs,
congress
specifically
provided
for
specific
uses,
such
as
industrial
use.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
no.
they
make
the
decision
initially,
but
congress
didn't
give
them
any
discretion
as
to
the
factors
used
in
making
that
decision.
congress
specified
the
terms
in
section
6,
and
it's
a
pure
question
of
law
as
to
whether
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can
do
it.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
if
congress
has
spoken
and
it's
ascertainable
by
principles
of
statutory
construction
and
congress
did
not
in
the
statute
delegation
discretion
to
the
agency
on
that,
then,
no,
i
don't
believe
this
court
should
give
deference.
i
think
this
differs
from
cases
in
which
congress
clearly
indicated
that
an
agency
shall
develop
rules
for
its
jurisdiction
over
counter
claims
or
the
agency
shall
determine
whether
this
is
a
flood
claim
so
that
permits
are
required.
in
each
of
those,
the
court
makes
the
initial
determination,
we've
delegated...
that
congress
has
delegated
the
law-making
function,
the
discretion
to
the
agency,
to
consider
matters
of
policy
and
to
resolve
it.
in
this
statute,
under
section
6,
under
their
argument,
it
is
a
question
of
did
congress
delegate
a
decision.
it's
a
question
of
construction.
section
6
versus
their
suggestion
that
congress
silently
created
an
exception
for
the
missouri
river
to
the
positions
of
the
act.
the
missouri
river
basin
was
clearly
a
major
focus
of
the
debate
on
the
flood
control
act
of
1944,
but
questions
of
jurisdiction
were
resolved
in
the
debate
over
section
8
and
the
debate
over
section
6,
and
in
both
of
those
debates,
what
happened
was
that
congress
rejected
the
approach
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
asserting
here
today
and
every
official
position
of
the
secretary
of
the
army
indicate
that
they
cannot
rely
on
the
authority
of
army
under
section
6.
we
believe
that
interior's
position
ignores
the
legislative
history
and
the
protections
that
congress
imposed
in
the
act
for
other
uses.
our
protection
by
contrast
protects
all
uses
as
provided
in
section
6.
interior
has
no
authority
to
correct
flaws
that
it
perceives--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
--i
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
osenbaugh
i
think
clearly
they
have
not
established
the
threshold
requirement
for
their
contention
that
reclamation
law
applies,
which
is
that
it
must
be
a
reclamation
development
to
be
undertaken
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
under
the
pick-sloan
plans.
it
is
not.
oahe
is
currently
undertaken
by
army
and
not
interior.
