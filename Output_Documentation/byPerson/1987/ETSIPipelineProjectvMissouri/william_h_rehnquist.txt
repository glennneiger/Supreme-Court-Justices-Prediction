mr.
minear,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
minear,
getting
back
just
for
a
moment
to
this
business
of
the
relationship
between
the
secretary
of
the
army
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
certainly
if
the
secretary
of
the
army
had
joined
in
signing
this
contract,
there
wouldn't
be
any
lawsuit
at
all,
would
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
minear.
i
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
osenbaugh.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
osenbaugh,
when
you
say
under
army
control,
you
don't
mean
day-to-day
management;
you
mean
under
army
jurisdiction
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
are
the
consequences
of
that
control
that
you're
referring
to,
so
far
as
interior's
right
to
dispense
water
for...
to
use
surplus?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
osenbaugh.
mr.
minear,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
the
case
is
submitted.
