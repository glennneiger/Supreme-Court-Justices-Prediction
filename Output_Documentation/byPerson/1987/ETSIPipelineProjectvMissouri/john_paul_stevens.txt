justice
stevens
well,
it
certainly
would
have
answered
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,--
justice
stevens
--which
was
that
it's
a
joint
responsibility
rather
than
a
single
responsibility.
justice
stevens
but
they
didn't
sign
it,
did
they?
justice
stevens
this
lawsuit
would
be
over
if
the
secretary
of
the
army
had
signed
this
contract.
justice
stevens
certainly,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
wouldn't
have
been
written
the
way
it
was.
justice
stevens
perhaps.
but
what
was
the
vise
in
the
agreement
according
to
them
that
they
didn't
have
the
approval
of
the
army?
that's
the
only
vise
according
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
the
case
would
have
been
the
same
if
the
army
had
endorsed
the
contracts,
we
ratify
and
approve
everything
that's
being
done
here?
justice
stevens
and
then
the
states
would
make
the
same
claim?
justice
stevens
well,
some
other
ground,
certainly.
but
you're
telling
us
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
agrees
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
this
authority
but
isn't
willing
to
sign
these
papers.
that's
what
the
lawsuit
is
all
about.
justice
stevens
well,
whether
it
was
necessary
or
not,
they
could
have
avoided
a
lawsuit
and
a
lot
of
judicial
time
if
they
had
signed
the
contract.
justice
stevens
is
there
any
legal
significance
to
their
having
been
consulted
and
approved?
justice
stevens
then,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
does
not
have
the
authority
to
act
independently.
justice
stevens
what
if,
after
the
consultation,
the
army
says
i've
heard
everything
you've
consulted
me
about,
but
i
just
think
you're
all
wrong,
i'd
like
to
use
this
water
for
down
stream
purposes?
justice
stevens
then,
the
secretary
of
interior
could
not
act
independently?
justice
stevens
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can
act
independently
unless
the
army
objects?
justice
stevens
strange
law.
mr.
minear,
the
secretary
of
the
army
couldn't
have
signed
this
contract,
could
he,
purporting
to
act
under
the
reclamation
act?
justice
stevens
can
i
ask
one
other
question
before
you
get
any
farther
into
your
deference
argument?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
status
of
the
contract
right
now?
as
i
understand
it,
the
project
is
not
going
to
be
used
for
the
originally-intended
purpose.
justice
stevens
is
it
a
matter
of
indifference
to
the
secretary
of
interior
what
use
the
water
is
put
to?
do
you
care
what
they
do
with
the
water?
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
do
with
the
water?
justice
stevens
they
were
going
to
use
it
in
some
kind
of
coal
slurry,
weren't
they?
justice
stevens
and
that
purpose
was
approved,
but
you
don't
know
what
they
really
will
do
with
it
now?
justice
stevens
that's
a
matter
entirely
within
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
interior
to
approve
of
the
purpose
or
disapprove?
justice
stevens
is
there
an
obligation
to
consult
with
the
army
now?
justice
stevens
if
i
may
ask
one
other
question.
i
hate
to
keep
interrupting.
but
supposing
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
a
given
quantity
of
water,
whether
it
was
surplus
water
the
army
had
jurisdiction
over,
or
unutilized
irrigation
water,
to
whom
would
we
defer
on
that...
on
resolving
such
a
dispute?
justice
stevens
that
could
be
resolved
in
the
executive
branch
if
this
one
can't
be?
justice
stevens
i'm
not
sure
why
that
dispute
is
resolvable
within
the
executive
branch
any
more
than
this
one
is.
justice
stevens
and
you're
telling
me
that
in
this
case,
you
wouldn't
have
solved
the
dispute
by
resolving
that
dispute
and
having
the
president
of
the
united
states
tell
them
both,
i
think
this
water
should
be
used
for
that
purpose,
i'd
like
you
both
to
sign
this
contract?
we'd
still
have
this
lawsuit?
justice
stevens
well,
another
whereas
clause,
by
virtue
of
authority
given
by
that
statute
and
by
the
authority
given
by
section
6
to
the
army,
we
sell
you
this
water.
justice
stevens
i
know
it
wasn't
mentioned.
justice
stevens
i
was
puzzled
as
to
what
disputes
are
resolvable
within
the
executive
branch
and
why
you
have
to
come
to
us
about
them.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it's
perfectly
clear
that
one
or
the
other
or
both
had
the
authority
to
dispose
of
this
water,
is
it
not?
justice
stevens
either
the
army
or
the
secretary
or
both
clearly
had
the
authority
by
virtue
of
a
combination
of
section
6
of
one
act
and
section
9.
justice
stevens
i
understand
that's
your
position,
but
nobody
could
contest
the
power
to
sell
this
water
if
they
both
agreed
and
invoked
both
statutes,
that
we
won't
try
to
define
the
water
as
either
surplus
or
irrigation,
because
whatever
it
is,
we
want
to
dispose
of
it
for
this
purpose.
justice
stevens
would
you
help
me
with
the
problem
i've
had
with
your
adversary?
would
you
agree
that
if
the
secretary
of
the
army
had
said,
well,
we're
not
sure
whether
it's
surplus
water
or
irrigation
water,
but
we
join
in
the
contract,
would
you
still
have
an
objection
to
this
transaction?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
would
you
take
the
position
that
if
you
win
this
lawsuit,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can't
dispose
of
this
water,
then
they
said,
well,
we
will
now
classify
it
as
surplus
water
rather
than
that,
you'd
say
they
can't,
and
would
you
also
say
they
couldn't
sell
it
then
either?
justice
stevens
so,
the
answer
is
you
would
be
opposed
to
that
sale,
too?
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
another...
put
it
a
different
way.
say
the
president
of
the
united
states
thinks
we
ought
to
sell
this
water
and
he
calls
in
the
secretary
of
the
army
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
says,
how
can
we
do
it,
and
they
do
all
the
paper
work
in
the
world
on
it,
would
you
find
any
objection
to
their
power
to
dispose
of
this
water,
if
they
all
agreed
they
wanted
to
do
it?
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
trying
to
get
your
position.
justice
stevens
what
would
you...
would
you
have
any
objection
to
a
contract
that
was
signed
by
both
the
secretary
of
the
army
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
sought
its
authority
in
both
statutes,
said
we
don't
want
to
worry
about
which...
whether
to
classify
it
as
surplus
or
extra
irrigation
water,
we
just
want
to
dispose
of
this
water
for
this
purpose,
would
you
say
they
had
no
power
to
do
that?
justice
stevens
they
didn't
do
anything
except
what
they've
done
here.
they've
accommodated
nothing
else.
they
have
all
this
very
large
amount
of
water
in
this
particular
reservoir.
would
you
say
that
given
the
facts
we
all
know
are
true
as
of
now
and
just
recited
them
all
in
the
contract,
both
the
army
and
the
interior
signed
the
contract,
would
you
have
any
valid
objection
to
the
contract,
to
the
sale
of
the
water?
justice
stevens
well,
they
gave
precisely
the
same
protection
that
this
contract
gives.
well,
if
i
understood
it,
if
interior
markets
it,
all
interior
has
to
be
concerned
about
is
whether
other
irrigation
needs
are
met,
and
it's
not
necessary
for
interior
to
think
about
down
stream
users
at
all
if
they
aren't
using
it
for
irrigation.
now,
if
the
army
sells
it
as
surplus,
then
it's
my
understanding
that
consideration
must
be
given
to
the
flood
control
and
other
possible
power
uses
and
other
uses
of
down
stream
users
above
and
beyond
irrigation
use,
is
that
correct?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
another
stupid
question,
probably?
but
is
it
your
position
that
the
water
that
would
be
supplied
pursuant
to
this
contract
is
surplus
water
within
the
meaning
of
section
6?
justice
stevens
so,
the
answer
is
yes?
justice
stevens
i'm
sorry.
i've
got
to
go
back
to
that
finding.
that
finding
was
not
necessary,
though,
under
your
theory
of
the
case.
justice
stevens
and
it's
not
only
consultation,
but
a
finding
similar
to
that
requirement,
no
adverse
effect
down
stream?
