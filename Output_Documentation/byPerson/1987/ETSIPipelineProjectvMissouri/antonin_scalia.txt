justice
scalia
and
supply
it
why?
because
it
becomes
surplus?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
nice,
but
what
does
surplus
water
mean?
i
thought
it
meant
spill-over.
justice
scalia
what
else
could
it
possibly
mean?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
very
desirable,
but
does
that
transform
it
into
surplus
water?
that's
the
issue.
justice
scalia
well,
it
was
addressing
one
aspect
of
problems
of
water
that
is
not
being
used
and
making
that
water
usable,
but
only
one
type
of
water
that
wasn't
being
used;
that
is,
surplus
water,
which
means
spill-over
water,
that
is
not
being
reserved
for
irrigation,
is
not
being
reserved
for
any
other
use.
justice
scalia
you
know,
that's
meeting
one
aspect
of
that
problem,
but
to
say
you
meet
one
aspect
of
the
problem
is
not
to
say
you
intend
to
meet
all
aspects,
including
water
reserved
for
irrigation
that
is
not
being
used.
you
would
not
consider
that
surplus
water,
would
you?
justice
scalia
but
the
meaning
of
surplus
water
is
quite
relevant
to
the
entire
case,
whether
it...
because
it
pertains
not
just
to
the
army's
position
but
to
what
the
two
agencies
can
do.
justice
scalia
he
has
no
authority
under
the
provision
under
which
the
contract
purported
to
be
executed.
justice
scalia
nor
is
it
clear
that
he
had
any
authority
nor
is
it
clear
that
he
even
asserts
to
have
any
such
authority
under
the
surplus
water
provision
of
the
act
which
he
is
in
control
of.
justice
scalia
so,
there's
no
possible
basis
on
which
he
could
conscientiously
have
signed
the
contract.
justice
scalia
the
most
he
could
do--
--the
army--
--would
be
to
agree
with
interior
that
it
was
a
good
idea
to
do
it,
which
he
did.
justice
scalia
what
are
the
terms?
so,
it
would
have
to
be
used
for
coal
slurry.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
justice
stevens
obviously
would
be
correct
if
it
were
clear
and
if
you
acknowledged
that
the
army
had
authority,
if
it
had
jurisdiction
over
this
water,
to
dispose
of
it,
but
that
isn't
clear.
justice
scalia
and
that
not
being
clear,
the
only
way
to
do
it
with
assurance
of
lawfulness
was
through
interior.
justice
scalia
it
says
in
the
pick
plan,
the
pick
plan,
i
believe,
utilization,
utilization
of
storage
reserved
for
irrigation
in
all
multi-purpose
reservoirs
should
be
in
accordance
with
regulations
prescribed
by
interior.
now,
this
is
certainly
utilization
of
storage
reserved
for
irrigation.
now,...
at
least
it's,
you
know,
close
enough
for
government
work.
it's
certainly
a
reasonable
meaning
of
that
phrase
and
that's
the
meaning
that
interior
and
army
have
both
chosen
to
give
it.
why
shouldn't
we
accept
that?
justice
scalia
but
6
and
8
don't
just
apply
to
this
dam;
they
apply
to
everything,
right?
justice
scalia
but
this
pick
plan
only
applies
to
this
one
facility
and
for
this
one
facility,
congress
did
approve
in
the
statute
the
pick
plan.
the
broad
outlines
of
it
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
broad
outline,
that
utilization
of
storage
reserve
for
irrigation
shall
be
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
prescribed
by
interior.
justice
scalia
i
agree.
i
can
see
arguments
pro
and
con,
both,
but,
you
know,
i
don't
think
that
either
of
them
is
so
over-powering
that
i'm
willing
to
ride
over
what
both
interior
and
army
agree
should
be
the
accepted
meaning
of
it.
justice
scalia
where
does
it
go
if
the
interior
lets
the
contract
as
opposed
to
the
army?
the
money
the
army
gets
from
it
goes
into
the
treasury.
isn't
there
some
other
disposition
if
the
interior
department
sells
the
water?
justice
scalia
right.
do
you
contest
that,
that
there's
a
different
disposition
depending
on
which
agency
has
it?
justice
scalia
well,
maybe
not
to
interior.
if
the
sg
were
here
just
representing
interior,
i
might
agree
with
you,
but
certainly
congress
delegated
to
interior
and
army
the
decision
of
what
their
respective
jurisdictions
are
as
an
initial
matter.
i
mean,
it's
always
ours
in
the
last
analysis,
but
as
an
initial
matter,
surely
the
division
of
jurisdiction
between
army
and
interior
is
a
matter
for
army
and
interior
to
decide.
justice
scalia
well,
the
theory
always
is
that
there
is
some
real
jurisdiction,
but
the
initial
decision
as
to
what
that
real
jurisdiction
is
is
for
interior
and
army,
not
interior
alone.
if
you
said
that,
i'd
agree
with
you.
interior
might
be
impinging
on
army's
ground,
but,
here,
you
have
both
army
and
interior
saying
this
is
how
we
think
the
jurisdiction
comes
out.
now,
it
may
be
absolutely
wrong,
but
at
least
you've
got
to
say
that
that's
the
initial
cut
at
it
and
that
cut
should
be
given
some
deference,
shouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
we
give
no
deference
on
pure
questions
of
law.
