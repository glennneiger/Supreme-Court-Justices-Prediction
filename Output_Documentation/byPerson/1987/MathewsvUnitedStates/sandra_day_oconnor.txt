justice
o'connor
well,
certainly
to
date,
the
court
hasn't
determined
that
the
constitution
requires
the
courts
to
recognize
entrapment
as
a
defense.
justice
o'connor
may
i
ask
you
about
a
minor
procedural
point.
the
government
seems
to
take
the
position
that
what
we
review
here
is
the
district
court's
denial
of
the
motion
for
mistrial,
rather
than
the
denial
of
the
motion
in
limine.
do
you
have
a
position
on
that?
justice
o'connor
if
entrapment
is
properly
raised
as
a
defense
in
a
case,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
government
is
required
to
disprove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
o'connor
and
what's
your
position
on
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
o'connor
the
court
below
never
weighed
the
evidence,
did
it?
justice
o'connor
but
you
want
us
to
do
that
in
the
first
instance?
justice
o'connor
what's
the
burden
of
proof
in
entrapment.
is
it
an
affirmative
defense
and
entirely
the
burden
of
the
defendant?
justice
o'connor
does
the
burden
ever
shift
to
the
government
based
on
the
production
of
evidence
by
the
defendant?
justice
o'connor
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
o'connor
mr.
rothfeld,
can
you
envision
a
case
in
which
evidence
of
that
kind
might
come
out
on
cross
examination,
for
example,
of
the
government's
witnesses,
but
in
which
the
defendant
never
takes
the
stand
at
all,
and
asks
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
for
alternative
instructions.
no
intent,
and
if
you
do
find
intent,
entrapment.
justice
o'connor
and
you
wouldn't
deprive
the
defendant
in
those
circumstances
of
the
alternative
instruction?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
i'm
asking
you
now.
justice
o'connor
what
if
we
don't
want
to
go
off
on
that
ground
and
instead
we
want
to
decide
the
issue
on
which
cert
was
granted?
justice
o'connor
that
could
be
left
open
to
the
court
below
on
a
remand.
i'm
just
asking
whether
you're
going
to
argue
the
point
on
which
we
granted
cert,
and
if
so,
what
you
propose
to
say
about
it?
justice
o'connor
but
couldn't
a
defendant
in
a
particular
case
take
the
position
that
he
didn't
have
the
necessary
intent
but
if
for
some
reason,
the
jury
found
that
he
did,
he
says
that
he
was
entrapped.
is
that
necessarily
inconsistent?
justice
o'connor
well,
speak
not
in
terms
of
this
case,
then,
but
hypothetically.
justice
o'connor
of
course,
what
makes
this
difficult
is
that
we
normally
think
that
the
government
is
put
to
its
proof
in
these
criminal
cases,
and
the
jury
may
look
at
circumstantial
evidence
to
determine
that
the
defendant
had
the
requisite
intent
to
commit
the
substantive
offense,
and
it
may
not,
the
defendant
may
believe
he
didn't
have
the
intent.
he
may
sincerely
believe
that.
and
yet,
the
jury,
on
the
basis
of
the
circumstantial
evidence
may
find
he
did.
now,
is
the
defendant
then
to
be
deprived
of
an
argument
to
the
jury
based
on
other
evidence
that
entrapment
then
is
appropriate
for
him
to
urge
to
the
jury?
