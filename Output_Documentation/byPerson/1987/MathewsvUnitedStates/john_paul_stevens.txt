justice
stevens
but
are
you
arguing
that
we
should
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted,
then?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
but
are
you
arguing
that
we
should
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted?
justice
stevens
if
you're
saying
we
ought
to
decide
another
question
other
than
the
one
we
granted
cert
to
review.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
it
true
that
he
made
a
motion
in
advance
of
trial
that
raised
the
issue
and
had
that
motion
been
decided
the
other
way,
perhaps
the
record
would
have
developed
differently?
justice
stevens
did
the
defendant
take
the
stand
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
well,
isn't
it
possible
one
reason
is
that
there's
really
not
any
necessary
inconsistency
between
saying,
well,
sure
i
did
these
things,
but
i
didn't
intend
to
commit
a
crime,
and
to
the
extent
i
did
them,
i
did
them
because
the
government
agent
talked
me
into
it.
is
there
any
inconsistency
there?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
under
the
seventh
circuit
rule,
they've
got
to
admit
that
they
intended
a
crime.
justice
stevens
well,
why
in
this
very
case,
this
is
a
government
official
who
borrowed
money
from
somebody
who
presumably
wanted
to
induce
him
to
take
official
action
that
would
favor
him.
what
if
the
defendant
gets
on
the
stand
and
says
i
didn't
realize
he
had
any
business
before
the
agency
at
all.
i
thought
it
was
a
purely
personal
transaction.
i
had
no
intent
to
commit
a
crime.
that's
the
first
part
of
my
testimony.
the
second
part
is,
everything
to
do
with
this
loan
was
induced
by
him.
he
came
in,
he
offered
me
very
favorable
interest
rates,
he
offered
me
more
money
than
i
needed,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
and
therefore,
i
was
persuaded
to
take
this
loan.
maybe
that's
not
sufficient
entrapment,
but
why
is
it
inconsistent
to
say
on
the
one
hand,
i
didn't
have
criminal
intent,
and,
b),
to
the
extent
i
did
anything
wrong,
i
was
entrapped?
what's
inconsistent
about
it?
justice
stevens
because
factually
i
didn't
realize
he
was
doing
business
with
my
agency.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
why
do
you
presume
there's
false
testimony.
maybe
he's
telling
the
truth
when
he
says
i
thought
they
were
entirely
separate
and
he
wasn't
doing
business
here,
but
the
government
has
some
different
witnesses
that
the
jury
may
believe.
he
may
have
been
telling
the
truth,
and
he's
also
telling
the
truth
when
he
says,
to
the
extent
i
did
anything,
the
government
agents
are
responsible
for
my
conduct.
it
is
not
necessarily
true
that
he
lied
in
either
case.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
he's
been
convicted
here,
but
every
defendant
before
he
gets
on
the
stand
is
presumptively
innocent.
when
you
get
the
problem
before
trial,
you're
presuming
the
man
is
innocent.
justice
stevens
you
don't
presume
he's
going
to
give
you
false
testimony.
justice
stevens
is
it
not
correct
that
the
reasons
you
advance
for
your
position
would
apply
equally
to
self-defense,
because
there's
an
inconsistency
there
too.
you
might
well
argue
that
you
cannot
plead
self-defense,
because
that's
not
the
true
story
if
you
really
are
guilty.
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
do
it
if
you
plead
not
guilty.
justice
stevens
because
it's
not
obvious
that
there's
any
inconsistency,
whereas
it
is
obvious
in
these
other
cases
there's
an
inconsistency.
justice
stevens
they
certainly
are
because
if
he's
insane,
he
probably
couldn't
have
had
the
intent
to
commit
the
crime.
