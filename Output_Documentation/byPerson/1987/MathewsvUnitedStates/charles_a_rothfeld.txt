mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
gimbel
spent
i
think
most
of
his
time
talking
about
the
inconsistency
question
in
this
case,
and
i'll
reach
that
in
a
little
while
and
explain
why
we
think
he's
wrong
on
that.
but
before
i
do,
there
is
a
prior
question
in
this
case,
one
which
we
think
is
logically
precedent
to
that
issue,
and
one
which
is
of
considerable
practical
importance:
that
is,
when
is
there
sufficient
evidence
in
a
case
to
bring
an
entrapment
defense
to
the
jury
in
the
first
place.
now,
to
appreciate
our
position
on
that
point,
one
has
to
appreciate
what
went
on
in
this
case.
this
case
was
a
run
of
the
mill
undercover
operation.
a
government
agent
offered
petitioner
a
payoff.
at
trial,
petitioner
conceded
that
he
accepted
the
offer.
the
offer
was
repeated
on
several
subsequent
occasions
and
petitioner
conceded
he
accepted
each
one.
petitioner
conceded
that
he
on
at
least
one
occasion
that
he
himself
asked
for
the
payoff.
petitioner
conceded
that
he
took
the
money
without
hesitation
when
it
was
finally
produced
by
the
agent.
the
jury's
verdict
establishes
conclusively
that
this
payoff
was
in
fact
an
illegal
gratuity.
now,
we
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
on
these
facts,
which
are
repeated
in
closely
varying
forms
many
times
everyday
in
many
undercover
operations,
petitioner
has
not
produced
sufficient
evidence
to
bring
his
entrapment
instruction.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no.
we
certainly
recognize
that
that
was
the
issue
presented
in
the
petition,
and
as
i
say,
i
will
address
that
in
a
moment.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
also
correct,
justice
white.
the
reason
we
advance
our
alternative
ground
for
decision,
it
is
certainly
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance.
it
was
a
ground
that
was
advanced
in
the
lower
courts
and
advanced
in
our
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
and
we
think
it
is
a
logically
precedent
question
to
decide
whether
there
was--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
we
also
think
there's
an
important
reason
to
resolve,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
issue
that
we've
presented,
the
question
of
when
entrapment
is
properly
in
the
case
is
a
tremendously
important
practical
question.
it
arises
in
every
entrapment
case,
and
there
are
a
great
many
entrapment
cases.
and
when
an
entrapment
instruction
goes
to
the
jury
in
a
case
in
which
it
is
not
properly
there,
that
is
not
cost
free.
entrapment
is
an
extremely
confusing
defense.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
we
are
not.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
as
i
say,
we
think
that
it
is
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance
which
is
a--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
it
did
not,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
make
any
factual
determinations
or
sift
through
the
record.
our
submission
is
that,
even
accepting
as
true,
all
of
the
evidence
offered
by
the
petitioner
at
trial,
the
court
can
decide,
and
should
decide
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
entitle
him
to
an
entrapment
instruction.
and
as
i
say,
that
is
a
legal
question,
a
purely
legal
question.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
on
that
point,
i
agree
with
mr.
gimbel's
suggestion
that
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
the
setting
of
this
case.
the
judge
went
on
to
say
that
he
would
permit
the
defendant
to
introduce
evidence
relating
to
inducement.
the
defendant
at
no
point
has
ever
suggested,
either
before
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
court--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes,
he
did.
he
did
not
suggest
there
was
any
evidence
relating
to
the
entrapment
question
that
he
would
like
to
have
introduced
and
was
foreclosed
from
introducing
by
the
in
limine
ruling.
indeed,
since
the
defendant
did
take
the
stand,
and
he
testified
extensively
about
precisely
what
the
government
did
to
lead
him
into
the
crime,
if
in
fact
the
government
led
him
into
it,
it's
impossible
to
imagine
what
other
evidence
he
could
have
offered
on
that
point.
he
gave
his
account
of
what
happened
to
him.
and
as
i
say,
it
is
a
very
important
practical
question,
because
when
an
entrapment
instruction
goes
to
a
jury
improperly,
it
can
lead
to
all
sorts
of
jury
confusion
because
entrapment
is
a
confusing
defense,
it
can
lead
obviously
in
some
cases
to
unjustified
acquittals.
in
some
cases,
the
focus
on
predisposition
will
lead
to
unjustified
convictions.
in
every
case,
there
is
a
potential
for
confusing
the
jury.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
there's
no
question
that
it
is
an
affirmative
defense,
just
as
insanity
or
any
other
number
of
affirmative
defenses.
and
the
absence
of
entrapment
is
not
an
element
of
any
offense
that
the
government
is
constitutionally
required
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
therefore,
congress--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
courts
of
appeals
have
generally,
although
not
universally,
said
that
there
is
a
burden
of
production
on
the
question
of
inducement,
and
to
a
certain
extent
on
the
question
of
predisposition
that
lies
on
the
defendant.
that
once
the
defendant
has
satisfied
this
burden,
it
shifts
to
the
government
to
disprove,
prove
predisposition
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
that
is
the
usual
standard
that
is
applied
by
the
federal
courts
where
affirmative
defenses
are
involved,
except
in
the
insanity
case
where
congress
changed
that
by
statute
in
1984.
although
again,
it
is
clear
that
congress
or
in
the
absence
of
congressional
action,
the
court
can
place
the
burden,
allocate
the
burden
however
it
wishes.
in
order
to
resolve
what
i
think
is
a
very
important
legal
threshold
question
when
entrapment
instruction
should
go
to
the
jury,
it
is
essential
to
start
with
a
number
of
characteristics
of
the
entrapment
defense.
entrapment,
i
think,
is
fair
to
say,
is
a
curious
doctrine
and
its
origins
and
rationale
are
somewhat
obscure
and
have
been
hotly
debated
by
the
courts.
but
the
definition
of
entrapment
is
at
this
point
quite
clear,
as
mr.
gimbel
suggested.
a
defendant,
to
make
out
a
case
of
entrapment
must
show
that
government
action
induced
criminal
conduct
on
the
part
of
someone
who
was
not
predisposed
to
commit
the
crime,
someone
who
is
the
unwary
innocent
described
in
this
court's
opinions.
several
things
follow
directly
from
this
definition
of
entrapment.
first,
it
is
quite
clear
that
although
it
is
often
said
that
the
entrapment
defense
is
designed
to
protect
innocent
people
against
overzealous
police
conduct,
an
entrapped
defendant
is
not
an
entirely
nonculpable
defendant
and
a
simple
example
makes
this
clear.
if
someone
is
induced
to
commit
a
crime
by
his
friend
or
his
brother-in-law
or
by
any
private
party,
he
has
no
entrapment
defense.
no
matter
how
powerful
the
inducement,
so
long
as
it
falls
short
of
duress,
that
person
will
be
convicted
at
trial.
now,
when
the
government
provides
the
inducement,
there
may
be
some
reason...
and
the
court
has
found
a
reason
to
create
a
defense...
but
the
complete
lack
of
blameworthiness
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
is
not
one
of
those
reasons.
there
must
be
some
other
reason
to
let
someone
go
after
he
has
in
fact
committed
all
the
elements
of
the
offense
with
the
requisite
mental
state.
a
second
thing
follows
from
the
definition
of
entrapment.
the
entrapment
doctrine
is
often
said
to
act
as
a
prophylactic
rule
that
prevents
the
police
from
making
criminals
out
of
otherwise
law
abiding
people.
but
the
status
of
the
defendant
as
otherwise
law
abiding
we
think
is
critical.
it
means
that
the
kind
of
government
conduct
that
may
give
rise
to
an
entrapment
defense
is
conduct
that
is
calculated
to
make
a
normally
law
abiding
person
commit
a
crime,
conduct
that
might
be
said
to
put
the
moral
fiber
of
that
person
to
an
unfair
test.
and
even
in
those
circumstances
where
there
is
this
sort
of
coercive
conduct,
an
entrapment
defense
is
not
necessarily
made
out
no
matter
how
coercive
the
government's
action,
a
defendant
will
be
convicted
if
he
was
predisposed
to
commit
the
crime,
if
he
was
the
unwary
criminal
and
not
the
unwary
innocent
described
in
this
court's
opinions.
now,
these
characteristics
of
entrapment
tell
us
something
very
important
about
the
defense.
it
is
a
very
narrow
doctrine.
it
comes
into
play
only
at
the
intersection
of
two
independent
policies,
where
the
defendant
has
a
relatively
reduced
culpability,
and
where
the
government
action
is
overbearing.
and
this
central
fact
about
entrapment
dictates
what
the
defendant
must
show
to
take
his
entrapment
claim
to
the
jury.
first,
in
a
formula
used
by
judge
mcgowan,
among
many
other
lower
court
judges,
defendant
must
show
inducement
of
a
sort
that
might
realistically
be
expected
to
lead
a
normally
law
abiding
person
to
commit
a
crime.
it's
obviously
not
enough
to
satisfy
this
requirement
that
the
government
is
the
but
for
cause
of
the
crime.
that's
going
to
be
true
in
every,
for
example,
police
decoy
operation.
but
the
unlucky
criminal
who
chooses
to
mug
an
undercover
police
officer
clearly
has
not
been
entrapped.
by
the
same
token,
a
simple
criminal
proposition
or
simple
solicitation
of
the
defendant,
a
simple
offer
of
a
payoff
cannot
be
enough
to
raise
inducement.
the
court
has
always
emphasized
that
the
government
must
be
free
to
present
opportunities
or
the
facilities
for
the
commission
of
crime.
and
again,
in
judge
mcgowan's
observation
is
a
general
behavioral
assumption
that
people
should
not
have
difficulty
resisting
criminal
temptations,
no
matter
how
tempting
the
offer.
when
the
offer
stands
alone
without
more,
it
is
something
we
expect
people
to
resist.
and
again
examples
make
this
quite
clear.
if
an
undercover
policeman
approaches
someone
on
the
street
and
offers
to
buy
heroin
from
that
person
or
offers
to
sell
him
stolen
goods,
or
offers
him
a
payoff,
that
person
if
he
accepts
the
transaction
clearly
has
not
been
entrapped
because
that's
the
sort
of
thing
we
expect
everyone
to
be
able
to
resist
without
any
difficulty.
for
inducement
to
be
present
in
a
case,
there
must
be
something
more
than
that.
there
must
be
clearly
some
element
of
coercion
in
the
government's
conduct,
or
some
powerful
appeal
to
sympathy.
something
that
explains
why
a
normally
law
abiding
person
might
have
committed
the
crime,
and
something
that
serves
to
mitigate
that
person's
involvement
in
the
crime,
something
that
gives
us
a
good
reason
to
let
him
off.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
is
certainly
possible
to
imagine
such
a
case,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
taken
inconsistent
positions,
and
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
there
is
no
need
to
decide
that
in
this
case
because
the
defendant
himself
took
the
stand.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
our
preferred
approach...
and
we
understand
that
there
is
a
close
question
as
to
which
of
the
two
approaches
is
preferable...
our
preferred
approach
is
the
seventh
circuit's
approach,
as
i'll
explain
later
on
at
the
end
of
my
argument.
we
think
that
a
defendant
who
is
seeking
the
special
care
of
the
entrapment
defense
should
not
be
entitled
to
argue
to
the
jury
simultaneously
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
the
crime,
because
the
existence
of
entrapment
presupposes
the
existence
of
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense.
as
i
say,
we
understand
that
when
the
defendant
has
not
himself
taken
the
stand,
or
introduced
evidence
which
is
directly
inconsistent
with
that,
the
inconsistency
is
not
quite
so
powerful
as
it
is
in
this
case.
but
as
i
say,
i'll
explain
our
position
on
that
in
more
detail
at
the
tail
end
of
my
argument.
we
think
and
my
focus
now
is
we
hope
the
court
uses
it
to
dispose
of
this
case
is
the
ground
that
because
there
was
no
coercion,
no
powerful
appeal
to
sympathy
of
this
sort,
no
overbearing
government
conduct,
there
could
not
have
been
and
clearly
was
not
inducement.
and
when
there
is
no
inducement,
the
case
should
not
go
to
the
jury.
there
is
of
course
a
second
prerequisite
to
the
entrapment
defense,
that
is,
the
existence
of
predisposition.
defendant
who
wants
the
benefit
of
the
entrapment
defense
must
have
been
at
least
persuaded
to
commit
the
crime.
he
could
not
have
been
waiting
for
an
opportunity
that
the
government
happened
to
present
to
him.
and
while
it
may
not
always
be
easy
to
separate
predisposed
and
unpredisposed
defendants,
certainly
a
defendant
who
jumps
at
a
criminal
opportunity,
in
judge
friendly's
words,
who
was
ready
and
willing
to
commit
the
crime
without
persuasion,
cannot
assert
that
he
lacked
predisposition.
and
without
at
least
some
evidence
in
the
case
that
there
was
a
lack
of
predisposition,
the
courts
are
quite
clear...
or
at
least
many
courts
have
held
that
entrapment
should
not
go
to
the
jury.
and
we
think
that's
appropriate.
as
i
say,
in
making
this
argument,
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
make
any
factual
findings.
we
think
that
accepting
the
petitioner's
own
account
of
the
crime,
own
account
of
what
happened
here,
his
own
account
of
the
inducement
and
his
reaction
to
it,
the
court
can
decide
and
should
decide
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there
was
no
entrapment
and
therefore
the
issue
should
not
have
gone
to
the
jury.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
that
were
the
logically
precedent
question
to
decide,
we
certainly
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
that.
although
we
would
suggest
that
it
might
be
appropriate
in
that
case
for
the
court
to
then
go
on
and
resolve
what
we
have
called
the
first
question
in
the
case,
and
conclude
that
although
defendants
may
legally
be
entitled
to
present
alternative
arguments,
this
defendant
with
his
showing
was
not
entitled
to
bring
his
entrapment
defense
to
the
jury,
and
dispose
of
the
case
on
that
ground.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
will
argue
that.
let
me
simply
then
make
one
final
point
on
our
first
submission,
justice
o'connor.
the
reason
that
we
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
court
will
not
have
to
make
factual
findings
and
why
it
is
an
important
legal
principle
that
should
be
settled
in
this
case,
can
be
found
from
looking
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
i
suggested
at
the
outset
are
typical
of
undercover
operations.
here
there
was
as
i
suggested
a
simple
offer
and
acceptance,
in
fact
a
series
of
offers
and
acceptances.
there
was
no
coercion,
there
were
no
attempts
at
persuasion.
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
remotely
called
overbearing
on
the
part
of
the
government.
in
arguing
for
inducement,
all
the
petitioner
himself
was
able
to
say
was
that
the
government
agent
told
him
that
if
he
didn't
take
the
money
quickly,
the
agent
would
spend
it
himself
so
that
his
wife
wouldn't
find
it.
putting
this
sort
of
time
limit
on
a
criminal
proposal
we
think
is
clearly
not
overbearing
and
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
should
lead
anybody
to
commit
an
offense.
and
as
i
said,
a
defendant
who
cannot
show
inducement
beyond
a
simple
offer
and
acceptance
is
not
entitled
to
bring
his
case
to
the
jury.
while
that's
enough
to
dispose
of
our
first
argument,
i
should
add
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
in
fact
predisposed
to
commit
the
crime.
there
was
a
simple
offer
and
acceptance.
he
conceded
a
trial
that
he
expressed
in
interest
in
the
first
offer.
he
conceded
at
trial
that
he
expressed
interest
in
all
the
subsequent
offers.
he
conceded
that
he
took
the
money
without
hesitation.
his
only
excuse
was
that
he
viewed
the
payoff
as
a
personal
loan
and
not
an
illegal
gratuity
but
that
excuse
was
conclusively
rejected
by
the
jury.
now,
on
the
second
point,
which
we
think
provides
an
independent
and
equally
fundamental
reason
for
denying
an
entrapment
instruction
here,
a
point
that
justice
o'connor
has
asked
about
and
that
was
the
focus
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
we
think,
obviously
correctly,
that
the
defendant's
simultaneous
attempt
to
say
that
he
did
not
commit
the
crime,
and
to
argue
entrapment
as
an
alternative
ground
for
acquittal
presented
inconsistent
defenses.
the
defendant
was
trying
to
say,
in
effect,
i
didn't
do
it,
but
if
you
don't
believe
that,
i've
got
another
one
for
you;
the
government
made
me
do
it.
it
seems
to
us,
as
an
initial
matter,
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
inconsistency
of
these
defenses.
the
court
has
specifically
defined
entrapment
as
the
commission
of
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
at
the
instance
of
the
government.
and
the
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
the
essence
of
entrapment
is
the
implantation
of
a
criminal
disposition
and
a
specific
criminal
intent
in
the
mind
of
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
can
give
you
two
answers
to
that,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
one
empirical
and
one
theoretical.
the
question
arises
with
great
frequency
in
entrapment
cases
and
with
great
infrequency
in
other
sorts
of
cases.
we
searched
diligently
and
could
find
very
little
authority
anywhere
on
whether
or
not
inconsistent
defenses
outside
of
the
entrapment
context
are
appropriate.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
that
defendants
generally
perceive
that
they
will
so
damage
their
credibility
if
they
make
clearly
inconsistent
defenses
before
a
jury,
that
they
just
simply
don't
try
to
do
it
very
often.
so
the
question
really
has
no
practical
importance
outside
the
entrapment
area.
defendants
do
attempt
in
a
great
many
entrapment
cases
to
raise
the
affirmative
defense,
raise
alternative
defenses.
i
think
that
one
reason
they
do
that
is
because
entrapment,
as
the
courts
have
noted,
is
quite
a
confusing
defense.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
if
the
acts
were
all
the
elements
of
the
crime,
there
wouldn't
be.
but
if
the
requisite
mental
state
is
an
element--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
inconsistency
in
that
i
think
was
in
the
profoundest
sense
that
a
jury
cannot
simultaneously
believe
that
a
defendant
was
entrapped
and
that
he
did
not
commit
the
crime.
commission
of
the
crime
obviously
presupposes
having
the
requisite
mental
state.
a
defendant
who
denies
the
mens
rea
as
petitioner
testified
about
himself
at
trial,
could
not
have
had
obviously
a
criminal
intent.
and
a
defendant
who
lacked
a
criminal
intent
could
not
by
definition
have
been
entrapped.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
we
think
that
in
a
case
such
as
this
one,
it
necessarily
is.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
as
a
general
matter,
i
would
say
yes,
they
are
inconsistent.
a
defendant
who
testifies
that
he
lacked
the
mental
state
is
implicitly
testifying
that
he
was
not
entrapped.
he's
saying
that
there
was
no
improper
mental
state
at
all
in
the
case.
to
find
that
he
was
entrapped,
the
jury
must
find
by
definition
that
there
was
an
improper
mental
state
that
was
implanted
in
the
defendant
by
the
government.
that's
the
finding
the
jury
has
to
make.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that's
quite
right,
justice
scalia.
it's
certainly
true
that
the
defendant
was
not
so
self-destructive
as
to
simultaneously
ask
the
jury
to
find
that
he
didn't
have
the
mental
state
and
that
he
was
entrapped
into
committing
the
crime.
the
inconsistency
lies
in
the
fact
that
his
two
alternative
defenses
cannot
simultaneously
be
true.
and
he
is
telling
the
jury
one
thing
when
he
testifies
on
the
stand.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
two
statements
that
you've
made,
i
didn't
have
criminal
intent,
and
the
government
made
me
a
loan--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--those
two
statements
are
not
necessarily
inconsistent,
but
when
the
defendant
says,
i
did
not
understand
that
i
was
doing
something
illegal
and
did
not
intend
to
do
something
illegal,
and
then
asks
the
jury
to
find
i
was
entrapped,
which
by
definition
means
that
i
had
the
improper
mental
state
and
that
the
improper
mental
state
was
implanted
in
me
by
the
government,
those
two
propositions
cannot
simultaneously
be
true.
now,
certainly
a
jury
can
make
seriatim
findings,
yes,
he
had
the
right
requisite
mental
state,
and
we
find
that
the
mental
state
was
implanted
by
the
government.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
court
indicated
explicitly
in
russell
that
every
element
of
the
crime
must
be
committed.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
if
he
said
every
element
of
the
crime
was
there,
he
would
have
an
entrapment
defense.
but
he's
not
saying
that.
he's
saying
that
the
crucial
element
of
the
crime,
the
requisite
mental
state
was
not
there.
and
in
fact
in
the
entrapment
context,
the
requisite
mental
state
is
the
critical
element
because
entrapment
focuses
peculiarly
on
the
origin
of
the
concededly
existing
improper
mental
state.
that's
what
the
jury's
asked
to
find.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
if
he
did
not
believe
in
this
case
that
he
was
taking
the
money
for
an
improper
purpose
as
a
gratuity
rather
than
as
a
personal
loan,
he
would
not
be
guilty
of
the
crime,
he
would
not
have
committed
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense.
that
was
what
he
asserted
was
true.
and
for
him
to
say
that
the
government
intended
for
this
money
to
be
an
illegal
gratuity
but
that
was
not
my
intent,
he
is
denying
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
hope
you
do
believe
they're
inconsistent,
justice
white.
and
there
are
several
things
that
we
think
are
wrong
with
it.
first
of
all,
when
a
defendant
has...
particularly
in
the
entrapment
setting...
when
a
defendant
has
taken
the
stand
and
has
advanced
his
view
of
the
case,
he's
obviously
entitled
to
testify,
but
he's
not
entitled
to
testify
untruthfully,
and
he
can
fairly
be
held
to
the
story
that
he
tells
on
the
stand.
when
he
tells
a
story
that
is
inconsistent
with
his
having
been
entrapped,
we
think
for
him
to
ask
for
acquittal
on
entrapment
grounds
is
to
ask
for
a
windfall
acquittal,
which
is
not
justified
on
his
stated
view
of
the
facts.
and
a
defendant
who
is
acquitted
on
that
ground
has
been
acquitted
on
the
basis
of
something
that
he
has
implicitly
testified
is
not
true.
now,
this
is
particularly
clear
in
the
entrapment
setting.
a
defendant
who,
let
me
take
a
step
back.
as
i
suggested
earlier,
in
discussing
the
first
aspect
of
this
case,
a
defendant
who
has
been
entrapped
and
wants
to
be
acquitted
on
that
ground
is
not
a
non-culpable
defendant.
he
is
unlike
a
defendant
acquitted
on
any
other
affirmative
defense
basis,
and
unlike
a
defendant
who
is
acquitted
on
insanity
grounds
or
self-defense
grounds
or
duress
grounds.
does
not
have
a
complete...
those
people
have
a
complete
justification
or
excuse
for
what
they
did.
the
entrapment
defendant
doesn't.
and
therefore
the
court
has
emphasized
entrapment
is
a
uniquely
narrow
defense.
we
ought
to
have
a
particularly
good
reason
to
allow
a
defendant
to
make
this
defense.
now,
certainly
when
a
defendant
believes
that
there
are
factual
grounds
that
exist
that
support
his
claim
that
he
did
not
factually
commit
the
crime,
he's
entitled
to
present
those
grounds.
and
when
a
defendant
believes
there
are
factual
grounds
that
exist
that
prove
that
he
was
entrapped,
he
is
entitled
to
make
those
arguments.
but
we
don't
see
an
impropriety
in
saying
that
given
the
nature
of
the
entrapment
defense,
he
should
be
put
to
his
choice.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
certainly
a
major
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
jury's
conviction
in
the
case
that
it
believed
that
his
account
of
the
crime
was
not
true.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that
is
certainly
true,
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that
is
true.
but
when
a
defendant
takes
the
stand
and
denies
the
commission
of
the
crime,
it
is
inconsistent
with
that
denial
for
him
to
say
to
the
jury
that
i
was
entrapped
into
committing
this
crime.
and
we
think
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
allow
a
defendant
to
present
two
inconsistent
grounds,
what
judge
gee
called
a
smorgasbord
of
inconsistent
defenses
that
a
jury
can
pick
and
choose
from.
and
i
emphasize
it
is
certainly
true
that
this
argument
depends
in
large
part
on
the
grounds
that
we
want
to
advance
in
the
truth
seeking
function
of
the
trial
but
we
think
it
is
particularly
powerful
in
the
entrapment
setting,
because
entrapment
the
court
has
emphasized
for
a
variety
of
reasons
is
a
narrow
defense.
defendant
is
in
a
sense
being
given
a
special
benefit
that
no
one
else
whose
acquitted
on
affirmative
defense
grounds
receives.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i'll
give
you
two
answers
to
that,
three
answers.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
in
someone
who
advances
another
affirmative
defense,
and
a
defense
to
an
element
of
the
offense,
our
argument
would
apply
in
that
setting.
that
person
is
advancing
two
inconsistent
statements
before
the
jury
and
we
think
that
is
inappropriate.
however,
we
think
that
the
argument
that
we're
making
has
special
force
in
the
entrapment
setting
because
of
the
particular
nature
of
the
entrapment
is
something
which
does
not
entirely
excuse
the
defendant,
we
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--not
at
all,
justice
stevens.
in
many
cases
involving
other
affirmative
defenses,
there
will
not
be
an
inconsistency
in
a
defendant
who
says
i'm
insane
and
i
didn't
know
where
i
was
on
the
day
of
crime.
and
therefore,
you
haven't
proved
me
guilty,
but
if
i
did
it,
i
must
have
been
insane.
those
are
not
necessarily
inconsistent.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
he
may
say
that
he
factually
doesn't
know
where
he
was
on
the
day
of
the
crime.
he
may
not
have
physically
committed
the
act,
but
if
he
committed
the
act,
he
must
have
been
insane
because
he
is
insane.
those
are
not
necessarily
inconsistent.
a
jury
can
find
both
of
those
things
to
be
true.
that
is
not
true
in
the
entrapment
setting.
a
jury
cannot
find
that
the
defendant
lacked
the
requisite
mental
state
as
he
has
testified,
and
that
the
defendant
was
entrapped
into
committing
the
crime,
which
as
i
say
presupposes
the
mental
state
having
been
implanted
in
his
mind
by
the
government.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
we
were
unable
to
find
any
authority
on
that
point,
and
i
think
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
realistic
case
in
which
that
will
arise.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
typically
true.
a
defendant
who
having
advanced
his
claim
that
he
factually
was
not
guilty
at
the
close
of
trial
we
think
should
for
that
reason
be
foreclosed
from
advancing
the
entrapment
affirmative
defense.
if
he
wants
to
make
entrapment
as
an
affirmative
defense,
he
is
free
to
do
so,
but
he
ought
to
choose
that
course
of
litigation
strategy
at
the
outset
of
the
trial.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
defendant
generally
may
put
the
government
to
its
proof.
but
entrapment
of
course
is
an
affirmative
defense,
and
the
burden
can
be
placed
wherever
the
court
finds
that
it's
appropriate.
and
we
think
given
the
unique
nature
of
entrapment
as
the
sort
of
affirmative
defense
which
avoids
the
defendant's
guilt
that
he
it
should
not
be
permitted
to
make
these
torts
in
inconsistent
arguments.
thank
you.
