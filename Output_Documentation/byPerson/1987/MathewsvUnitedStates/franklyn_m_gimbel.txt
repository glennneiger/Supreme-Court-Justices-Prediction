mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
yes.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
has
held
for
more
than
fifty
years
that
a
person
accused
of
a
crime
may
assert
entrapment
as
a
defense
to
such
charge.
in
russell,
the
entrapment
defense
was
characterized
as
a
judicially
fashioned
rule
to
enforce
limitations
upon
the
executive
branch
of
government
in
the
execution
of
federal
laws
under
our
constitution.
the
sorrells
case
of
course
which
was
the
case
that
was
decided
55
years
ago,
defined
entrapment
in
the
following
terms:
"the
defense
is
available
not
in
the
view
that
the
accused,
though
guilty,
may
go
free,
but
that
the
government
cannot
be
permitted
to
contend
that
if
government
officials
are
the
instigators
of
the
conduct,
the
person
is
guilty.
"
the
essence
of
the
position
that
we
are
asserting
here
today
is
that
while
this
court
in
the
four
significant
cases
in
which
it
has
addressed
the
issue
of
entrapment,
sorrells,
sherman,
russell
and
hampton,
has
dealt
various
with
the
prerequisites
for
the
establishment
of
entrapment
as
a
method
by
which
non-guilt
can
be
established
by
a
person
who
is
the
object
of
government
ploy.
this
court
has
not
to
date
dealt
with
the
ground
rules
by
which
that
issue
can
get
to
a
person's
jury.
consequently,
what
has
developed
is
a
scenario
where
we
have
essentially
three
different
predicates
for
a
person
who
asserts
an
entrapment
defense
to
get
to
his
or
her
jury.
if
a
person
is
accused
of
a
crime,
for
example,
in
milwaukee,
wisconsin...
as
is
the
case
here...
that
person
must
first
admit
that
he
or
she
committed
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
with
which
he
or
she
is
charged,
and
also
that
he
or
she
intended
to
violate
the
law.
if
the
same
person
were
accused
of
the
same
crime
in
the
district
of
columbia,
that
person
would
have
to
admit
that
he
or
she
participated
in
the
acts
which
are
forbidden
by
the
criminal
statute,
but
not
that
such
conduct
was
intended
to
violate
the
law.
in
san
francisco
or
phoenix,
a
person
who
is
accused
of
the
same
crime
need
not
admit
to
any
misconduct,
need
not
admit
to
in
fact
having
participated
in
the
acts
which
constitute
a
violation
of
the
underlying
accusation.
and
so--
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
--that's
very
good,
justice
blackmun.
that
is
why
the
case
is
here,
but
in
the
government's
response
to
our
brief,
it
seems
as
though
they
are
suggesting
this
is
an
inappropriate
case
to
be
a
vehicle
for
addressing
the
dichotomy
of
views
on
how
a
case
gets
to
the
jury,
because
they
argue
essentially
that
there
is
not
a
sufficient
factual
basis
for
this
case
to
have
presented
the
issue
of
entrapment
appropriately.
and
i
would
hope
that
that
would
not
be
used
by
the
court
to
sidestep
in
fact
the
need
to
send
out
a
signal
to
the
courts
throughout
this
country
as
to
what
in
fact
is
the
predicate
for
a
person
who
asserts
that
their
conduct
was
not
the
product
of
predisposition
but
rather
was
as
a
consequence
of
the
intent
which
was
implanted
within
their
mind
by
government
conduct.
now
what
rings
clearly
as
essentially
the
competition
in
the
views
of
what
entrapment
is
or
should
be
in
this
court's
cases
is,
on
the
one
hand,
the
majority
views
of
sorrells,
sherman,
russell,
and
hampton,
that
entrapment
is
in
fact
a
method
by
which
a
person
who
shows
inducement
can
be
found
not
guilty
of
the
offense.
whereas,
the
alternative
view
that
has
been
at
least
articulated
by
the
concurring
opinions
in
sorrells
and
sherman,
and
by
the
dissenting
opinions
in
hampton
and
in
russell,
is
that
entrapment
should
be
viewed
in
the
sense
of
a
confession
of
illegal
conduct
by
an
accused
individual
and
the
avoidance
of
the
sanctions
of
that
illegal
conduct
by
essentially
a
forgiveness
of
the
conduct
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
in
that
the
government
conduct
should
essentially
be
a
bar
to
prosecution.
now,
in
sorrells,
the
court
very
clearly
rejected
the
notion
that
entrapment,
if
asserted
as
a
defense,
should
be
asserted
as
in
essence
a
plea
in
bar
to
the
extent
that
that
has
any
meaning
in
today's
jurisprudence.
and
if
essentially
that
point
of
view
is
viewed
as
against
the
decision
in
this
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
i
maintain
and
urge
you
to
consider
that
essentially
what
the
seventh
circuit
and
other
circuits
in
the
country
which
follow
that
rule
have
done
is
to
say
to
people
accused
of
crime
in
this
country
that
if
you
wish
to
have
a
jury
consider
that
issue,
you
must
first
assume
that
you
have
committed
all
of
the
elements
including
intent,
and
make
this
confession
that
was
spelled
out
in
justice
robert's
concurring
opinion
in
sorrells,
in
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion
in
sherman,
and
in
the
dissenting
opinions
in
russell
and
in
hampton.
and
so
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
this
court
were
tempted,
as
the
government
urges
it
to
be,
to
adopt
as
standard
for
telling
trial
courts
throughout
this
country
that
if
an
entrapment
issue
arises
during
the
course
of
a
case,
it
must
arise
in
an
environment
where
there
is
an
admission
of
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
including
intent.
and
then
essentially
there
is
the
posture
of
the
court
or
the
jury
forgiving
the
conduct
because
it
is
less
egregious
than
the
government
conduct
which
brought
it
about.
i
don't
think
then
for
example
that
this
court
could
both
maintain
as
precedent
on
the
issue
of
entrapment
the
dictates
of
sorrells,
sherman,
russell,
and
hampton,
and
adopt
the
point
of
view
that
is
expressed
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
mathews
case
as
the
precondition
to
having
the
issue
considered
by
a
jury.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
because
there
is
a
request
that
there
be
a
confession
by
the
accused,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
because
you
have
said
in
your
cases
on
entrapment
that
that
is
not
the
rule
that
is
to
be
applied.
in
sorrells,
there
was
the
contrast
between
the
majority
opinion
of
justice
hughes
and
the
minority
opinion
of--
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
--absolutely,
yes.
and
i
say
that
what
was
not
adopted
by
the
majority
was
the
notion
of
confession.
if
you
look
again
at
the
very
basic
definition
that
grows
out
of
sorrells
that
is
essentially
stating
the
proposition
of
what
entrapment
is,
it
says
it
is
not
the
view
that
the
accused,
though
guilty,
may
go
free
but
that
the
government
cannot
be
permitted
to
contend
that
he
is
guilty
of
a
crime
where
the
government
officials
are
instigators
of
the
conduct.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
well,
i
respectfully
disagree.
i
think
that
juries
in
this
country
have
been
given
a
great
amount
of
credit
for
being
able
to
diligently
follow
the
instructions
of
courts.
as
is
legion,
there
have
been
frequent
occasions
where
there
have
been
mid-trial
errors
and
curative
instructions
and
appellate
courts
have
found
that
traditionally
that
jurors
will
follow
the
instructions
of
the
judge
and
they
will
not
be
dissuaded
from
their
purpose
of
finding
the
truth
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
some
incident
occurred
that
was
inappropriate.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
i
do.
,--
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
--i
think
that
it
will
be
more
easily
judicially
administered
if
this
court
adopts
as
its
standard,
as
a
minimum,
the
positions
that
have
been
asserted
and
now
constitute
the
law
in
the
district
of
columbia,
in
the
fifth
circuit
or
in
the
ninth
circuit,
than
following
in
the
seventh
circuit.
because
the
seventh
circuit
view
essentially,
not
only
in
my
view,
intrudes
into
the
area
that's
not
been
recognized
by
majority
opinion
in
the
landmark
cases
on
this
issue
as
the
confession
avoidance.
but
additionally,
there
is
the
conflict
between
the
requirement
that
an
accused
essentially
admit
to
his
or
her
criminal
misconduct
and
his
or
her
fifth
amendment
rights.
in
other
words,
the
essence
of
the
requirement
in
the
seventh
circuit
is
that
no
person
accused
of
crime
can
consider
asserting
entrapment
as
a
defense,
but
for
the
fact
that
he
or
she
does
in
essence
incriminate
himself
of
the
offense
by
admitting
every
aspect
of
the
offense.
and
while
this
court
has
essentially
not
yet
dealt
with
the
entrapment
defense
as
rising
to
the
level
of
giving
birth
to
a
constitutional
basis
in
the
entrapment
defense,
it
has
said,
and
in
the
russell
case,
that
doesn't
mean
that
some
day
there
might
not
be
a
fact
situation
which
will
in
and
of
its
own
essence
suggest
that
there
is
such
an
outrageous
abuse
of
those
due
process
fundamentals
incorporated
in
the
fifth
amendment,
that
it
won't
view
entrapment
as
having
constitutional
overtones
that
have
to
be
addressed
by
this
court.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
it's
one
of
those
six
of
one,
half
a
dozen
of
the
others.
i
think
that
my
colleague,
mr.
kaufman,
who
assisted
me
in
this
and
tried
the
case,
was
so
persuaded
that
this
was
an
appropriate
case
for
the
presentation
of
the
issue
of
entrapment
to
the
jury
that
he
used
every
procedural
device
possible
to
try
to
revisit
the
subject
with
the
trial
judge
and
get
the
trial
judge
to
find
that
this
case
should
be
considered
outside
the
mold
of
the
seventh
circuit
prohibition.
and
so
he
started
with
the
motion
in
limine
and
he
ended
with
the
motion
for
mistrial,
but
the
essence
of
all
of
those
trial
procedures
is
essentially
that
the
trial
judge
made
an
unequivocal
decision
that
declined
to
submit
the
issue
of
entrapment
to
the
jury
on
the
ground
of
the
seventh
circuit
rule
against
having
that
issue
considered
by
a
jury
where
there's
not
first
this
admission
of
culpability.
and
while
the
government
urged
as
an
alternative
consideration
for
the
court
to
sidestep
giving
the
issue
to
the
jury,
a
factual
insufficiency,
the
judge
said
that
he
would
not
address
that
as
he
had
already
resolved
the
issue
on
the
first
step,
although
he
made
a
parenthetical
side
comment
that
he
thought
that
the
evidentiary
base
was
somewhat
shaky.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
it
is
my
view,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
courts
have
spoken
on
this
issue,
particularly
in
d.c.,
the
fifth
and
ninth
circuit,
have
essentially
said
this:
it
is
appropriate
for
an
accused
to
produce
evidence
that
there
was
in
fact
inducement.
and
in
fact,
in
the
berkeley
case
which
extensively
discusses
the
burdens
of
proof...
that's
a
decision
that
came
out
of
the
d.c.
circuit
and
which
was
affirmed
and
followed
in
the
recent
case,
kelly
case,
the
court
said,
it
is
appropriate
to
place
on
the
defendant...
and
i'm
using
the
language
of
that
case...
the
ultimate
burden
of
showing
government
inducement
of
the
crime,
and
thus
the
possibility...
and
that's
the
word
of
the
court...
of
entrapment.
we
do
not
think
that
the
defendant
should
bear
the
burden
of
proving
inducement
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
his
burden
in
requiring
the
prosecution
to
prove
predisposition
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
met
by
convincing
the
jury
that
there
is
some...
and
that's
another
word
of
the
court...
some
evidence
of
government
inducement
as
the
term
is
defined.
and
then
it
alludes
to
how
that
term
is
defined.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
my
position
is
that
once
there
has
been
the
surface
of
inducement
by
the
government
of
the
criminal
activities
of
the
accused,
that
then
another
element
of
proof
that
the
government
must
bear
is
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
accused
was
in
fact
predisposed.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
it
would
appear
to
me
that
by
doing
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
would
be
inviting
the
government
to
have
no
constrictions
on
their
use
of
deception,
decoy,
undercover
activities,
sting
and
what
have
you.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
if
you
raise
the
issue
of
self-defense,
then
the
prosecution
has
the
obligation
to
show
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
self-defense
in
fact
was
not
the
basis
upon
which
the
action
took.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
i
don't
think
it
would
be
efficient
productive
jurisprudence
to
lay
upon
a
person
accused
of
a
crime
any
more
burdens
that
he
or
she
might
otherwise
have.
and
i
think
that
it
is
consistent
with
an
accused
due
process
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
he
or
she
can
rely
on
his
or
her
presumption
of
innocence,
and
that
once
they
show
that
that
innocence,
if
it
has
been
intruded
into
as
in
the
case
of
an
entrapment
situation,
by
inducement,
that
it
is
better
law
for
there
to
remain
an
obligation
on
the
government
power
bringing
the
case
to
hold
and
continue
to
have
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
is
what
an
element,
justice
white?
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
i
am
echoing
the
sentiments
which
i
urge
this
court
to
adopt
of
circuit
courts
which
have
held
that
predisposition
should
be
treated
in
the
exact
same
way
as
any
other
statutory
element
of
an
offense.
that
non-guilt
is
ultimately
what
the
government
has
to
overcome.
and
if
entrapment
or
if
government
actions
would
get
in
the
way
of
the
conclusion
that
a
person
has
violated
the
law,
then
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
in
fact
they
can
satisfy
either
the
court
or
jury,
that
in
fact
guilt
exists
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
this
case,
if
an
element
is
that
in
fact
mr.
mathews--
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
--i
would
argue
that
the
defendant
should
be
relieved
of
burden
of
proof
on
self-defense,
yes.
but
not
raising
the
issue.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
that
that's
been
addressed.
i
can't
say.
but,
yes,
i
would
urge
that
self-defense,
like
predisposition
in
an
entrapment
case
is
a
matter
which
should
reside
within
the
obligation
of
the
government
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
i
think
that
the
logic
that
is
included
in
the
rationale
of
those
cases
which
have
held
that
an
accused
can
claim
that
he
or
she
did
not
intentionally
violate
the
law,
and
yet
have
the
issue
of
entrapment
submitted
to
his
or
her
jury
is
sound,
and
it
is
far
more
sound
than
the
logic
that
antedates
the
rationale
which
brings
us
here
today,
the
rule
of
the
seventh
circuit.
that
makes
no
sense
at
all,
in
my
view,
because
it
makes
impotent
the
claim
that
the
government
misbehaved
in
a
case
in
those
jurisdictions
without
a
great
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
the
accused.
and
i
just
don't
think
that
that
is
a
good
principle
for
there
to
be
in
existence
in
our
criminal
jurisprudence.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
the
comments
of
justice
scalia,
justice
stevens,
and
justice
o'connor,
on
what
i
believe
to
be
uniquely
in
this
case
the
lack
of
inconsistency
between
what
mr.
mathews
did
at
the
trial
and
his
being
in
an
appropriate
position
to
have
his
jury
consider
the
entrapment
defense.
in
fact,
while
the
facts
are
kind
of
immaterial
to
the
ultimate
call
in
this
case
by
the
court,
it
is
not
mr.
mathews
view
that
the
entrapment
defense
should
be
revisited
and
changed
in
this
case.
we're
willing
to
settle
on
the
fact
that
an
accused
must
first
show
that
he
was
induced
to
do
something
improper,
and
secondly
that
there
must
be
a
demonstration
that
he
was
not
otherwise
predisposed
once
the
activities
were
undertaken.
but
in
this
case,
mr.
mathews
was
accused
of
having
received
a
gratuity,
and
the
facts
show
that
mr.
mathews
was
a
long
time
associate
and
friend
of
the
government
agent.
they
had
a
personal
relationship
away
from
their
business
relationship.
they
had
in
fact
exchanged
finances
on
prior
occasions,
prior
to
the
time
when
mr.
deshazer
who
was
the
person
who
put
the
money
in
mr.
mathews'
hand
and
who
was
working
under
the
tutelage
of
the
fbi
and
recording
conversations
between
them
took
place.
and
so
mr.
mathews
was
essentially
confronted
with
this
dilemma.
and
i
think
in
this
case,
uniquely
so
because
as
justice
stevens
appropriately
pointed
out,
the
call
on
whether
or
not
mr.
mathews
could
get
the
entrapment
defense
submitted
to
his
jury
was
made
before
the
case
began.
and
so,
as
counsel
for
mr.
mathews,
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
his
trial
lawyer
to
say,
look,
fred,
if
you
want
to
go
to
this
jury
on
the
issue
of
the
fact
that
the
government
really
induced
you
into
this
conduct,
you
can't
get
up
on
that
witness
stand
and
tell
that
jury
that
you
did
not
intend
to
give
him
something
in
the
nature
of
some
official
performance
on
your
part
in
exchange
for
this
loan.
and
mr.
mathews
had
to
make
the
call.
that
would
be
dishonest.
i
did
not
anticipate
that
receiving
this
money
was
in
any
way
connected
to
my
position
as
an
employee
of
the
government
and
his
position
as
a
client
of
the
government.
and
there's
testimony
that
supports
that.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
i
don't
think
it's
different.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
no.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
no.
i
would
say
it's
contradictory
but
i
don't
know
that
the
jury
can't
consider
both
issues.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
and
my
posture
is
that
we
should
not
exclude
contradictory
testimony.
that
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
exclude
it
because
an
argument
can't
be
made
that
it's
not
contradictory
in
a
rather
global
sense.
and
in
this
case,
it's
not
so
global.
it's
pretty
narrowed
down.
and
i
think
justice
stevens
came
up
with
a
hypothetical
and
while
it
didn't
apply
to
this
case,
the
fact
that
a
person
works
for
the
government,
another
person's
a
client
of
the
government
in
that
particular
agency
and
there's
a
financial
transaction
between
them
that
essentially
doesn't
have
any
co-relationship
to
each
other
would
be
an
appropriate
basis
for
that
particular
individual
to
say,
no,
i
didn't
violate
the
law.
yes,
i
took
money,
yes,
i'm
an
employee
of
the
government,
yes,
this
person's
a
client
of
the
government.
but
all
of
these
things
were
done
under
the
inducement
of
the
client
of
the
government,
and
that's
what
happened
here.
and
he
said,
i'm
not
guilty
because
i
didn't
put
those
two
things
together.
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
the
jury
can
do
that.
they
can
put
that
together
and
say,
well,
mr.
mathews,
we
don't
agree
with
your
conclusion
that
you're
not
guilty.
we
think
you
are,
we
think
there
was
a
relationship.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
exactly.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
you
can
say
that.
i'm
hoping
you
won't
because
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
more
often,
it
seems
to
me,
would
promote
perjury.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
that
i
understand,
justice
white.
but
what
i
don't
understand
is
that
essentially
there
is
this
very
confined
area
within
which
a
person
can
say
i
want
my
jury
to
consider
government
conduct
in
my
case.
and
in
mr.
mathews
case
what
he
needed
to
do,
based
on
the
seventh
circuit
rule,
in
order
to
get
his
jury
to
consider
whether
the
government
activity
in
his
case
was
inappropriate,
was
to
say,
i
did
it,
i
was
wrong
in
every
single
respect,
even
though
he
didn't
believe
he
was.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
no.
not
true.
in
the
seventh
circuit,
you
must
affirmatively
admit,
you
can't
even
just
by
your
plea
of
not
guilty
get
entrapment.
you
can
in
d.c.
and
in
the
fifth
circuit,
but
you
can't
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
franklyn
m.
gimbel
i
just
can't
agree
with
that
proposition,
justice
scalia,
because
the
truth
on
intent
is
an
amorphous
concept
and
ten
people
looking
at
the
same
incident,
nine
may
view
it
one
way,
and
one
view
it
another
way.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
one
is
a
liar.
it's
from
his
perspective.
and
mr.
mathews
was
entitled
to
say
i
did
not
intend
to
relate
this
loan
to
some
improper
government
conduct.
and
that's
not
inconsistent
with
his
saying
that,
i
did
take
the
money,
and
i
did
have
some
dealings
with
this
man,
and
they
superimposed
this
intent,
they
juxtaposed
the
intent
on
me
in
the
scheme
of
their
dealings
with
me.
and
so
while
i
don't
need
to
say
that
at
least
in
my
view,
i
don't
need
to
convince
you
that
inconsistent
defenses
should
never
be
allowed,
because
i
don't
believe
that,
but
i
think
in
this
case
that
the
truth
is
something
that
is
so
elusive
when
it
comes
to
intent,
that
mr.
mathews
was
not
necessarily
playing
a
game,
when
he
said,
jury,
i
didn't
do
this
to
violate
the
law,
and
yet
whatever
i
did,
i
did
because
of
the
creative
activity
of
the
government,
and
so
i
should
have
had
my
jury
decide,
first,
did
i
do
this
to
violate
the
law,
and
then
once
reaching
that,
did
i
do
this
because
the
government
essentially
made
me
do
it,
or
induced
me
by
their
creative
activity
to
do
it.
and
i
think
that
that's
what
mr.
mathews
was
entitled
to,
and
i
think
that
the
seventh
circuit
rule
on
the
subject
matter
is
too
confining
and
it's
not
good
law
and
you
ought
to
look
elsewhere
for
your
decision.
and
the
elsewhere
is
out
there
in
this
circuit,
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
eloquently
argued
cases,
and
even
beyond
that
in
the
ninth
circuit
where
they
say,
you
can
go
in
and
say
anything
you
want
but
inconsistent
arguments
will
be
seen
by
a
jury
very
quickly,
and
you'll
lose.
and
that's
probably
the
truth.
and
so,
in
conclusion,
i
urge
you,
as
i
know
you
will,
to
look
very
closely
at
the
unfairness...
and
that's
what
it
really
is...
the
unfairness
of
the
constrictions
that
were
placed
upon
mr.
mathews
and
anyone
else
similarly
situated
by
the
seventh
circuit
rule,
saying
essentially,
that
you
must
admit
your
crime.
