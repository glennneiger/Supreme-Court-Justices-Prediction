you
can
convert
anything
into
a
non-contradiction
if
you
preface
the
second
part
of
it
with...
but
if
the
jury
finds.
i
mean,
even
the
quite
incompatible
defenses
of
self-defense
and
i
didn't
kill
the
person
can
be
made
to
sound
consistent
if
you
say,
i
didn't
kill
him,
but
if
the
jury
should
find
that
i
killed
him,
then
i
must
have
killed
him
in
self-defense.
justice
scalia
what's
wrong
with
the
inconsistent
defenses,
assuming
i
believe
that
they're
inconsistent.
so
what?
justice
scalia
are
you
saying
it's
the
same
reason
you
don't
allow
inconsistent
testimony
in
other
respects
why
you
would
not
allow
a
defendant
to
come
in
and
perjure
himself
to
say
one
thing
and
then
say,
but
if
you
don't
believe
that,
then
i
testify
to
the
opposite,
because
it
does
not
help
the
truth
seeking
process.
justice
scalia
what
about
self
defense.
are
you
allowed
to
make
a
self
defense
claim
and
at
the
same
time,
deny
the
killing.
justice
scalia
why
is
it
any
different
than
the
position
of
a
defendant
that's
accused
of
murder
who
really
believes
that
he
didn't
kill
the
individual,
someone
else
pulled
the
trigger.
on
the
other
hand,
the
individual
was
rushing
at
him
with
a
knife,
and
if
he
did
kill
him,
it
was
in
self-defense.
justice
scalia
it
isn't
different.
justice
scalia
and
you
don't
think
that
that's
contradictory
testimony:
number
one,
i
didn't
kill
him,
and
number
two,
i
killed
him
in
self
defense?
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
we're
arguing
really
about
whether
this
is
any
different
from
any
other
contradictory
testimony.
i
think
we're
arguing
about
whether
there's
any
reason
to
exclude
contradictory
testimony
in
a
criminal
trial.
i
don't
see
how
this
is
any
less
contradictory
than
any
other.
justice
scalia
it
isn't
just
government
behavior
that
he's
complaining
about.
if
it
were
just
that,
there
would
be
no
inconsistency
at
all.
he
is
saying
that
this
idea
in
my
mind
was
not
there
of
its
own,
the
government
put
it
there.
that's
what
he's
saying.
he
is
saying
something
about
his
mind
that
is
utterly
inconsistent
about
what
his
not
guilty
plea
says.
he's
saying
this
idea
to
commit
the
crime
was
put
there
by
the
government.
now,
it
is
an
inconsistency.
maybe
you
don't
mind
inconsistency
in
criminal
trials,
but
the
advantage
of
it
is
that
it
puts
the
defendant
to
the
test
and
thereby
improves
the
truth
finding
function.
he
has
to
tell
the
truth.
now,
which
is
it.
you
say
the
one
or
the
other,
but
don't
come
in
and
say
both
because
it
makes
it
harder,
you
get
two
bites
at
the
apple
and
you're
playing
games
with
the
jury.
