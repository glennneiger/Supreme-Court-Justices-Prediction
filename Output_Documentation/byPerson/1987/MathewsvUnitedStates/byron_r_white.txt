justice
white
but
it's
certainly
not
an
element
of
the
crime
that
we're
talking
about,
is
it?
justice
white
i
mean,
even
if
you
said
the
government
ought
to
have
the
burden,
i
don't
know
why
proving
predisposition,
why
do
you
say
it
has
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
it's
not
an
element
of
the
crime?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
you
would
argue
then
that
self-defense,
that
the
defendant
constitutionally
should
be
relieved
of
any
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
that
defense?
justice
white
what
have
we
held
with
respect
to
that?
justice
white
that
is
the
very
ground
that
the
lower
courts
decided
the
case
on.
justice
white
i
guess
it
depends
on
how
you
define
entrapment.
he's
really
saying
that
sure
i
had
all
these,
all
the
elements
of
the
crime
were
there
but
every
one
of
them
was
induced
by
the
government.
justice
white
isn't
he
really
saying
that
the
element
of
intent
was
not
mine,
it
was
really
the
government's?
justice
white
but
there
is
an
issue
here,
how
far
the
entrapment
defense
ought
to
reach.
the
defense
was
thought
up
by
the
courts.
justice
white
i
suppose
we
could
say
that
the
entrapment
defense
is
available
but
only
where
there's
an
admission
of
all
the
elements
of
the
crime.
justice
white
it
makes
some
sense
in
the
terms
of
just
how
often
and
under
what
circumstances
is
entrapment
available
to
a
person
whose
committed
a
crime.
justice
white
well,
it
would
have
been
available
if
there
had
been
the
proper
groundwork
if
he
had
just
stayed
off
the
stand,
is
that
right?
