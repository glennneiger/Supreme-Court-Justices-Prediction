chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gimbel,
we'll
wait
just
a
minute
until
the
crowd
clears.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
mr.
gimbel.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
is
that
inconsistent
with
our
cases
on
entrapment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
we
take
the
majority
opinion
of
the
chief
justice.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
don't
see
that
lays
down
much
substantive
law.
certainly,
entrapment
is
an
affirmative
defense.
it's
created
by
the
courts
for
that
situation
where
these
opinions
describe
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
quite
natural
to
have
it
very
narrowly
tailored
since
it
isn't
the
absence
of
a
statutory
element
at
all.
and
i
for
one
would
think
there
is
a
considerable
danger
of
jury
confusion
if
you
could
just
introduce
it
without
a
very
substantial
requirement
of
a
showing
such
as
the
seventh
circuit
said.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
agree
that
the
courts
of
appeals
are
split
on
this
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
i
for
one
don't
see
any
strong
requirement
in
our
precedents,
one
way
or
the
other.
so
isn't
one
reason
that
we
should
now
think
about
how
easily
administered
is
this
judicially
created
defense
going
to
be?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
shouldn't
we
just
treat
the
whole
thing
as
an
affirmative
defense
right
down
the
line?
since
it's
judicially
created,
it
isn't
an
element
of
the
statute
at
all.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no.
if
we
say
it's
an
affirmative
defense,
all
we're
saying
is
it's
an
element
which
the
defendant
bears
the
burden
of
proof
on,
like
self-defense
in
many
states.
now,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
self-defense
as
a
defense.
but
many
states
require
the
defendant
to
bear
the
burden
of
proof.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
there
are
fifty
different
states,
and
i
dare
say
they
have
many
different
rules.
but
why
shouldn't
the
defendant
be
required
to
bear
the
burden
of
proof?
this
has
nothing
to
do...
all
the
elements
of
the
statute
have
been
satisfied.
and
in
sorrells
and
sherman
and
the
other
cases,
the
court
has
said,
well,
it
just
isn't
right,
even
though
all
the
other
elements
are
proved,
for
the
government
to
be
able
to
get
a
conviction
on
this
case
if
there's
this
entrapment
and
the
other
thing.
but
nothing
you've
said
thus
far
seems
to
be
a
very
good
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be
an
affirmative
defense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gimbel.
mr.
rothfeld,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
rothfeld,
we
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
that
mr.
gimbel
argued.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
government
isn't
entitled
to
argue
something
if
you
think
it
would
preempt
the
others,
but
certainly
you're
not
arguing
the
question
that
we
granted
certiorari
on?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
rothfeld,
what's
wrong
with
inconsistent
defenses
on
the
part
of
a
defendant?
for
instance,
can't
a
defendant
typically
raise
self-defense
without
having
pleaded
guilty
to
the
affirmative
charges
or
the
elements
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
defense
of
entrapment,
as
you
say,
presumes
that
every
other
element
of
the
crime
is
satisfied.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
ordinarily
have
the
nicety
of
pleading
in
a
criminal
case.
you
have
a
not
guilty
plea.
and
the
arguments
as
to
what
defense
is
yours
come
out
in
the
arguments
on
jury
instructions,
don't
they,
rather
than
just
on
pleadings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
mr.
gimbel,
you
have
nine
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gimbel,
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
fourth
of
these
cases
is
no.
86-6109,
mathews
against
the
united
of
states.
petitioner
frederick
mathews
was
an
employee
of
the
small
business
administration.
one
of
the
presidents
and
one
of
the
companies
participating
in
one
of
the
spa
programs
believed
that
mathews
was
attempting
to
obtain
loans
and
exchange
for
spa
benefit.
he
was
ultimately
convicted
in
the
district
court
in
milwaukee
but
in
the
course
of
his
trial
he
sought
an
instruction
on
entrapment
that
which
is
in
the
affirmative
defense
trying
to
show
that
the
government
got
into
this
thing
in
the
first
place,
and
the
trial
judge
refused
the
instruction.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
judgment,
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
as
to
whether
a
defendant
may
deny
committing
the
offense
charge,
which
mathews
did
deny
here
and
still
getting
an
instruction
on
entrapment.
as
explained
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
conclude
that
even
if
a
defendant
denied
one
or
more
elements
of
the
offense,
he
is
entitled
to
an
entrapment
instruction,
whenever
there
was
efficient
evidence
from
which
a
reasonable
jury
could
find
entrapment.
we
reject
the
government's
argument
it
is
because
the
affirmative
defense
of
entrapment,
which
assumed
the
commission
of
all
the
elements
of
the
offense
is
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
the
defendant
did
not
commit
those
elements.
the
defendant
may
not
rely
on
both
defences
simultaneously.
as
a
general
preposition,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
any
legally
sufficient
defense
reported
by
the
evidence,
and
this
rule
has
been
traditionally
applied
even
when
the
defense
is
they
are
inconsistent.
so,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
brennan
joins
in
this
opinion
has
filed
the
concurring
opinion;
justice
scalia
has
filed
in
the
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
blackmun
has
joined.
justice
kenendy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
