mr.
thomas
s.
martin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
covered
individuals,
title
vi
radically
alters
the
structure
by
which
we
are
governed.
it
divests
the
president
of
prosecutorial
power
that
even
the
appellant
admits
is
executive
in
nature,
and
it
transfers
that
power
in
part
to
persons
accountable
only
to
themselves
and
in
part
to
an
article
iii
court.
it
displaces
the
power
to
prosecute
from
institutional
controls
that
curb
ambition
and
bias
and
misjudgment
in
a
single
perspective.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
the
independent
counsel
performs
an
executive
function.
the
independent
counsel
is
an
anomaly
in
our
system.
she
performs
an
executive
function
but
she
is
not
under
the
president.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
it
does,
mr.
justice
white,
for
these
reasons.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
this
case
is
focused,
and
narrowly
focused,
on
a
single
kind
of
power,
and
that
is
the
power
of
criminal
prosecution,
which
this
court
has
said
many
times,
and
all
judges
have
described
as
inherently
and
exclusively
executive.
it
is
a
special
and
narrow
power.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
but
a
power
that
is
being
exercised
in
a
way
that
is
not
subject
to
appointment
and
control.
madison
defined
the
essence
of
executive
power
in
two
ways:
it
is
the
power
to
appoint
and
the
power
to
control
those
who
execute
the
laws.
under
this
statute
the
appointment
power
is
taken
away
from
the
president
and
given
to
a
court.
under
this
statute
the
power
to
control
is
taken
away
from
the
president
and
given
either
to
a
court
or
to
a
group
of
people
who
are
without
any
controls
upon
them.
i
am
always
fascinated
to
argue
this
case
because
the
statute
keeps
changing
every
time
we
do
it.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
essence
of
the
argument
relates
to
how
much
control
is
allowed
to
the
president.
and
i
think
facing
some
problems
with
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute,
independent
counsel
comes
and
says,
well,
this
statute
allows
all
kinds
of
control
to
the
attorney
general.
but
the
fact
is
it
cannot
be
saved
on
that
basis
because
it
is
so
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
congress
has
in
its
own
words
declared
its
intent
that
the
independent
counsel
be
a
person
totally
outside
the
control
of
the
attorney
general,
and
that
if
the
statute
is
interpreted
otherwise,
its
whole
purpose
is
defeated.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
there
is
such
a
provision,
and
i
think
the
'78
senate
report
perhaps
puts
it
on
the
head
as
to
what
that
means.
it
says,
this
section
594(f)
should
be
interpreted
more
as
a
goal
than
as
a
command.
it
was
a
decision
of
the
committee
that
the
best
procedure
was
to
leave
the
question
of
when
such
written
policies
of
the
department
of
justice
are
to
be
followed
in
the
discretion
of
the
special
prosecutor.
that's
congress's
intent.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
there
are
two
other
aspects.
it
says,
shall
be
bound
by
where
possible,
and
the
question
is
what
does
that
mean
and
what
outs
does
it
give
you.
but
i
understand
what
the
text
says.
i
think
that
there
are
two
other
aspects
of
it.
presidential
power,
the
power
to
decide
how
to
exercise
discretion,
whether
a
criminal
matter
should
be
brought,
how
it
fits
with
national
policy,
whether
matters
should
be
brought
in
front
of
this
court
or
not
cannot
be
reduced
to
a
set
of
rules.
that
is
why
we
have
a
president.
if
we
could
put
it
in
guidelines
we
could
do
away
with
the
president
and
just
put
a
bunch
of
books
on
the
shelves
and
have
people
follow
those
guidelines.
the
essence
of
the
executive
is
the
ability
to
make
policy
judgments
based
upon
specific
facts
of
complex
kinds
of
interests
and
to
resolve
them.
so
it
is
not
resolvable
by
a
set
of
guidelines.
in
addition,
while
there
are
guidelines
in
the
department
of
justice,
from
what
we
can
tell
and
from
what
commentators
have
said,
and
as
set
forth
in
the
brief
of
the
three
attorneys
generals,
those
guidelines
concern
an
extraordinarily
limited...
as
they
have
to
be...
part
of
the
total
discretion
of
the
executive
branch.
so
the
provision,
i
think,
both,
if
you
interpret
it
consistent
with
its
legislative
history,
is
not
binding.
in
any
event
it
is
not
enforceable.
you
do
not
know
what
the
special
prosecutor,
often,
is
doing
and
how
she
is
proceeding,
and
in
any
event
it
doesn't
provide
enough
control
to
allow
the
president
to
faithfully
execute
the
laws,
because
he
cannot
make,
at
all
the
various
stages
of
prosecution,
the
kinds
of
decisions
which
are
put
in
his
hands
and
his
hands
alone
by
the
constitution.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
he
certainly
doesn't,
justice
marshall,
and--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--he
does
not.
you
are
absolutely
right,
and
that
power,
by
congress's
enactment,
the
attorney
general
is
the
hand
of
the
president
with
respect
to
the
execution
of
those
powers.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
he
has--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--i
suspect
that
the
right
answer
to
that
is
with
respect
to
some
matters
he
makes
no
consultation
with
the
united
states
attorney
in
utah,
but
as
to
matters
where
he
or
the
president
chooses
to
exert
the
power
which
is
essentially
executive,
yes,
he
can,
he
can
direct
the
united
states
attorney
if
he
want
to,
and
that
power
is
the
essence
of
the
constitutional
scheme.
and
if
we
want
to
complain
about
him,
the
united
states
attorney,
we
can
go
to
the
president,
who
is
accountable
to
the
people.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
right,
because--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--a
prosecutor--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--the
question
is
independent
of
what.
under
our
system
of
government,
the
prosecutorial
power
was
put
in
a
person
who
is
accountable
to
the
people
and
who
is
elected
by
the
people.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
our
framers
were
concerned--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--excuse
me?
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
no,
but
the
president
was
elected.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
he
is
the
hand
of
the
president,
and
he
is
accountable
to
the
president
in
that
regard.
the
concern...
it
was
the
framer's
concern.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
we
think
in
a
particular
instance
it
would
be
a
good
idea
or
a
bad
idea,
but
the
framers
were
concerned
and
their
experience
with
the
presence
of
executive
power
in
the
hands
of
an
absolute
person.
they
understood
jail,
they
understood
the
power
of
an
absolute
and
unaccountable
monarch,
and
it
was
their
judgment
that
that
extraordinary
power
ought
to
be
put
in
the
hands
of
someone
who
was
accountable
to
the
people,
and
put
in
the
hands,
invested
it
in
the
president
and
entirely
in
the
president;
it
is
given
to
no
one
else.
and
no
one
throughout
our
history
has
ever
exercised
it
except--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--the
grand
jury
is
a
unique...
has
been
described
as
a
unique
animal
and
i
think--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--i'm
not
sure
it
is
in
any
branch
of
government.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
some
judges
have
described
it
as
independent.
it
has
very
limited
functions.
the
grand
jury
does
not
exercise
the
president's
power.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
the
grand
jury
cannot
return
indictments
without
the
united
states
attorney
signing
the
indictment.
ultimately,
it
is
the
president's
power
to
exercise
the
law.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
have
there
been
grand
juries
that
did
not?
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
there
have
been
grand
juries
that
have
acted
in
that
way,
justice
stevens.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
it
is
not
part
of
either
branch.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
it's
not
part
of
the
prosecutorial
function
of
the
executive
branch,
because
then
it
would
have
to
be
under
the
president,
and
it
is
not
part
of
the
judicial
branch
either.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
if
we
should
prevail
i
assume
that
the
grand
jury
that
issued
these
subpoenas
would
be
dismissed,
because
it
is
supporting
the
actions
of
an
inquiry
which
would
not
be
constitutional.
let
me--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--i
do
not
take
that
absolute
position,
but
i
do
take
this
position:
that
under
a
removal
standard,
if
you
have
an
officer
that
is
exerting
classic
constitutional
executive
functions,
if
he
is
prosecuting,
that
officer
has
to
be
subject
to
the
control
of
the
president,
and
it
may
be
that
control--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--you
could
have
situations...
for
example,
there
is
the
old
case
of
the
military
cadet.
now
that
person
who
was
subject
to
military
discipline
was
always
in
the
president's
control,
and
congress
placed
some
limit
on
the
removal
power
of
the
president,
and
the
court
sustained
that
particular
situation.
in
this
situation,
by
contrast,
the
conference
report
in
the
congress
is
very
clear
that
the
good
cause
removal
standard
is
at
the
heart
of
the
mechanism
protecting
the
independent
counsel's
ability
to
act
independently
of
the
president's
direct
control.
even
if
the
independent
counsel
fails
to
abide
by
presidential
order,
she
cannot
be
removed,
so--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--she
can
be
removed
for
a
kind...
the
problem
with
good
cause
is
the
question
is
what
is
good
cause,
and
the
legislative
history--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--not
according
to
the
legislative
history.
this
statute
was
intended--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--this
statute,
unlike
bowsher,
where
a
removal
clause
was
intended,
apparently,
and
was
exercised
to
generate
control
in
the
legislative
branch,
this
removal
clause
was
intended
to
make
sure
that
the
executive
cannot
control,
and
therefore
it
separates
the
executive
from
one
of
its
primary
functions,
first
appointment
and
then
control.
let
me
say
a
few
words,
if
i
can,
about
the
claim
of
the
independent
counsel
that
of
course
the
attorney
general
maintains
the
ability
to
make
decisions
at
the
threshold
with
respect
to
whether
an
independent
counsel
shall
be
appointed.
the
congress,
first
of
all,
describes
the
attorney
general's
function
as
a
screening
function.
as
justice
scalia
has
said,
it
has
to
be
done
in
a
very
short
time
period.
but
more
importantly,
it
has
to
be
done
in
a
situation
in
which
the
attorney
general
is
denied
investigatory
tools:
he
can't
use
a
grand
jury,
he
can't
use
compulsory
process.
so,
for
example,
in
this
case
congress
put
in
front
of
the
attorney
general
four
volumes,
two
and
half
years
of
investigation,
and
said
decide
in
90
days
without
any
investigatory
tools
whether
or
not
further
investigation
may
be
warranted.
that
question
stacks
the
decks
too
much.
it
provides
the
attorney
general
with
no
real
choice--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--it
did
not
come
totally
out
of
the
blue;
that
is
certainly
correct.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
he
had
the
whole
fbi
available,
but
the
criteria
which
is
imposed
on
the
attorney
general
is
to
make
a
decision
in
a
short
time
period
as
a
screen--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--i
think
the
difficulty
constitutionally
is
that
the
attorney
general
is
not
given
the
choice
that
he
normally
has,
if
it
were
a
situation
where
you
or
i
were
involved,
to
decide,
well,
i
need
further
investigation,
or
i
need
to
use
a
grand
jury,
or
i
need
to
dispose
of
it
in
one
of
many
different
ways
for
national
policy
reasons
or
national
security
reasons.
instead
he
is
given
one
choice
and
one
choice
only,
which
is
to
take
it
out
of
the
executive
branch
and
to
give
it
to
someone
who
is
subject
only
to
the
control
of
his
or
her
own
personal
views.
there
was
some
discussion
earlier
about
the
power
to
expand,
and
again
the
legislative
history,
i
think,
makes
clear
what's
the
court's
role
here.
first
of
all,
it
matches
a
person
to
the
particular
prosecution,
and
then
it
decides
what
shall
be
prosecuted.
in
the
iran-contra--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--it
certainly
is
true,
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
language
cannot
be
interpreted
in
a
way
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
or
to
defeat
the
legislative
purpose,
as
the
schor
case
said.
but
let
me
look
at
the
language--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--no.
but
i
can
give
you
the
specific
language
that
i
rely
upon
for
this
question
of
defining.
the
statute
says
the
attorney
general
assists
in
defining
jurisdiction.
the
statute
in
its
own
language
says
the
court
defines
with
respect
to
jurisdiction.
in
the
iran-contra
matter,
for
example,
materials
have
been
lodged
with
this
court.
it
was
the
court
that
decided
to
add
the
matter
of
nicaragua
as
a
response
to
a
senate
recommendation;
it
was
not
the
attorney
general
who
decided
that.
the
special
division
in
a
number
of
cases
adds
additional
people
or
related
matters
to
its
jurisdiction.
so
the
role
of
the
division
is
not
a
ministerial
one.
it
is
one
which
congress
has
thought
was
a
substantial
one,
an
important
power.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
it's
very
short:
it
says
the
court
shall
find
the
jurisdiction
of
the
prosecutor,
and
it
doesn't
say,
and
it
indicates
that
the
attorney
general
shall
provide
a
report
to
assist
in
that
process.
it
places
the
power
squarely
on
the
court;
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
it
does
not,
justice
rehnquist.
it
does
not.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
in
the
case
before
us,
for
example,
one
of
the
matters
which
the
court
resolved
the
independent
counsel
could
investigate
was
the
matter
of
a
conspiracy
claim
with
respect
to
mr.
olson,
a
matter
that
the
public
integrity
section
of
the
department
of
justice
had
decided
not
to
investigate
further
because
there
was
so
little
evidence.
in
other
words,
it
fell
below
this
frivolous
threshold.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
no,
but
it
did
expand
it
beyond
the
matters
that
were
referred
to
by
the
attorney
general,
and
included
matters
that
were
rejected
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
do
think
it
is
unconstitutional
to
reverse
decisions
that
the
hand
of
the
president
makes
in
enforcing
the
criminal
laws.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
the
statute,
again...
the
language
doesn't
say
anything
but
define,
the
legislative
history
suggests
the
power
to
add
related
matters.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
no,
our
submission
is
not
based
upon
the
expansion
activity
of
the
attorney
general,
it
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
matter
is
taken
out
from
the
executive
branch
altogether
so
that
he
can
no
longer
control
what
the
prosecutor
does,
and
with
respect
to
all
the
prosecutorial
decisions
which
affect
individual
rights
and
subject
a
person
to
all
the
power
of
the
state,
all
through
that
process
the
attorney
general
and
the
president
are
without
control.
and
that
is
what
this
statute
does
by
its
language
and
by
its
legislative
history
was
intended
to
do,
and
that
displacement
of
the
president
is,
we
think,
the
problem.
garland
concerned
the
pardon
power
of
the
president,
and
you
may
recall
the
issue
there
was
whether
from
the
pardon
power
of
the
president
there
could
be
excluded
out
a
certain
class
of
offenders.
that
is
to
say
those
people
who
had
raised
their
hands
against
the
nation
in
the
war
between
the
states.
and
the
supreme
court
took
up
that
matter
and
decided
unequivocally
that
that
could
not
happen,
that
congress
can
neither
limit
its
effect
nor
exclude
from
its
exercise
any
class
of
offenders.
when
the
constitution
gives
the
pardon
power,
when
it
gives
the
execution
of
the
laws
and
the
obligation
to
faithfully
execute,
it
gives
that
with
respect
to
you
and
me
and
with
respect
to
every
governmental
employee.
you
cannot
carve
out
certain
kinds
of
people
and
say
they
are
in
a
separate
system.
i
would
like
to
speak
a
little
bit
more
about
the
appointments
clause
for
just
a
minute.
there
has
been
a
great
discussion
here
about
how
one
should
interpret
the
appointments
clause,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
a
number
of
criteria.
first
of
all,
that
it
should
be
interpreted
consistently
with
the
purposes
of
the
clause,
which
is
to
create
accountability
and
not
to
place
appointments
in
a
branch
which
is
not
subject
to
the
people.
i
think
it
should
be
read
in
tandem
with
the
function
of
appointments.
in
a
number
of
cases,
myers
through
buckley,
this
court
has
said
that
the
appointments
function
is
tied
to
the
faithful
execution
obligation,
and
it
should
be
read
in
terms
of
that
as
well.
and
thirdly,
it
should
accommodate
the
specific
requirements
of
article
iii,
that
the
courts
remain
separate
and
independent,
requirements
that
are
reflected
in
a
constitutional
history
in
which
there
is
no
indication
of
court
appointment
of
executive
officers.
the
appointments
clause
here
is
relied
upon
not
just
for
an
appointment,
but
for
the
transfer
of
power
from
the
executive
to
the
independent
counsel--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--the
siebold
case
is
critical,
and
the
court
viewed
the
siebold
case
as
on
in
which
the
functions
fell
somewhere
in
between
the
executive
and
legislative
functions.
it
surely
did
not
involve
court--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--it
was
stipulated
by
the
parties,
and
the
court
took
no
issue
with
that
characterization.
what
the
court
did
say
is
that--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--it
recognized
that
in
situations
where
with
equal
congruity
it
could
be
placed
in
either
branch,
then
the
congress
had
that
power,
if
you
call
it
inter-branch.
what
it
did
not
say
is
that
one
could
use
the
appointments
clause
to
take
power
from
the
core
of
one
branch
and
remove
it.
one
could
use
the
appointments
clause,
for
example,
to
take
your
constitutional
power
to
decide
first
amendment
cases
and
put
it
in
some
other
branch
of
government,
or
put
it
in
some
place
which
is
totally
independent,
some
separate
and
new
entity.
siebold
relied
heavily
on
the
concept
of
congruity,
which
i
think
must
be
a
concept
of
looking
to
the
other
parts
of
the
constitution.
in
this
situation,
can
it
be
congruous
with
the
constitution
to
not
only
allow
the
appointment
of
such
a
person,
but
use
the
appointments
clause
to
transfer
power
and
to
involve
the
judiciary
in
elements
of
executive
action
that
it
has
never
been
involved
in.
let
me
say
a
few
words,
if
i
can,
about
the
judicial
participation.
as
the
judiciary
appoints
the
independent
counsel
and
the
courts
have
defined
its
jurisdiction,
the
judiciary
has
used
its
powers,
as
members
of
the
court
have
said,
to
issue
advisory
opinions,
to
sequence
investigations.
there
is
a
natural
invitation
for
the
judiciary
to
involve
itself
more
and
more
in
the
process
of
the
independent
counsel.
it
has
hand-picked
these
independent
counsel,
and
has
hand-crafted
their
jurisdiction.
this
presents
an
enormous
problem
for
the
appearance
of
impartiality
of
the
judiciary.
the
court
is
a
participant
in
the
article
ii
power.
it
first
of
all
participates--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--i
think
the
question
of
impropriety
is
a
question
of
degree
of
intimacy.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
do
not.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
there
are
a
couple
of
differences.
one,
the
court
has
a
particular
role
with
respect
to
prosecutors.
for
individuals
the
court
stands
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
individual
to
protect--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--well,
if
you
disagree
on
the
question
of
appointment
alone,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
go
to
the
next
step,
when
the
court
defines
jurisdiction
it
steps
over
the
line.
justice
marshall--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--of
course
the
question
is
not
just
what
was
done
here
but
what
the
statute--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--in
this
case,
then
i
would
ask
you,
and
the
court
might
well
wish
to
look
at
as
well,
those
parts
of
the
record
which
the
special
division
had
in
front
of
us,
and
which
was
indicated
specifically
that
public
integrity
section
had
declined,
for
example,
to
even
take
a
look
at
the
conspiracy
issue
because
it
was
too
frivolous,
and
that
is
precisely
the
issue
which
is
added
by
the
special
division
in
its
reinterpretation.
so
i
think
there
is
a
square
conflict.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
the
answer
has
to
be
resolved
by
looking
in
two
directions:
article
iii
and
article
ii.
in
an
article
iii
direction,
when
you
appoint
interim
united
states
attorney,
it
is
not
a
specific
matter.
that
person
is
to
handle
the
general
matters
in
the
united
states
attorney's
office.
in
addition,
the
court
does
not
go
beyond
it;
it
doesn't
sit
down
with
a
united
states
attorney
and
say,
now
here
are
the
matters
i
want
you
to
handle
in
this
particular...
here
is
the
scope,
here
is
the
particular
investigation,
here
are
the
laws
which
you
will
investigate.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
it
is
still
an
inter-branch
appointment.
it
may
not
be
constitutional.
if
you
look
at
the
article
ii
side
of
it,
i
think
the
difference
is
absolutely
enormous.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
it
need
not
be
reached
here,
but
the
court
in
the
solomon
case,
which
is
the
one
case
which
said
it
was
constitutional,
relied
heavily
that
in
that
situation
the
united
states
attorney
goes
right
into
the
executive
branch,
and
he
is
subject
immediately
to
the
control
of
the
executive
branch,
and
attorney
general,
if
he
wants
to,
can
remove
him
immediately.
so
it
doesn't
involve
the
displacement
of
power
from
one
branch
to
the
other.
that's
why
i
say
when
you
look
at
these
issues
of
what
you
can
do
on
the
appointments
clause,
it
is
important
to
look
at
what
its
ramifications
are
for
the
various
parts
of
our
constitution,
for
article
ii
and
article
iii.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
question,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
and
that
is
why
i
don't
think
this
case
ought
to
be
resolved
by
a
mechanical
rule.
i
think
the
way
to
resolve
this
question
is
to
look
at
what
the
particular
appointing
power
that
has
been
suggested
here,
the
particular
statutory
framework
that
is
urged
to
be
founded
on
this
appointing
power,
and
whether
exercise
of
that
kind
would
be
consistent,
in
the
words
of
the
siebold
court,
would
be
incongruous
with
the
other
parts
of
our
constitution.
it
is
important,
i
think,
not
to
read
the
appointment
clause
separate
and
apart--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
our
history...
to
add
to
your
point...
where
someone
was
appointed
by
a
court
to
handle,
independently
of
the
executive
branch,
one
of
the
core
functions
of
that
branch.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
and
yet
our
forefathers,
the
framers,
knowing
that
process
decided
to
vest
the
executive
power--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--the
answer
is
that
it
is
not
explicitly
stated
in
our
constitutional
history.
i
think
the
indication
of
what
has
happened
since
then,
that
that
power
has
always
been
put
in
the
hands
of
someone
who
has
been
appointed
by
the
president
or
the--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
--the
contemporary
practice
in
the
states
was,
i
think,
part
of
what
congress
decided,
what
the
framers
decided
not
to
follow.
they
decided
on
a
separation
of
powers
and
decided
not
to
follow
a
system
in
states,
which
often
merged
the
various
kinds
of
powers
in
the
way
you've
mentioned.
