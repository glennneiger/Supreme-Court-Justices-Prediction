justice
john
paul

mr.
davidson,
may
i
interrupt?
isn't
it
true,
though,
that
when
they
went
back
they
did
enlarge
somewhat
the
jurisdictional
definition
that
had
existed
originally,
to
at
least
encompass
review
of
these
two
other
individuals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
question.
what
branch
of
the
government
is
the
grand
jury
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
agree
it
is
unique.
which
branch
of
government
is
it
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
independent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
guess
it
returns
indictments,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
have
never
been
grand
juries
that
didn't
act
independently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
acted
without
the
guidance
of
an
executive
official?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
still
not
sure
what
your
answer
is.
is
the
grand
jury
part
of
the
executive
branch
or
the
judicial
branch?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
part
of
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case,
if
you
should
prevail,
what
happens
to
the
grand
jury
that
has
issued
these
subpoenas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
martin,
isn't
it
likely
that
the
attorney
general
had
some
knowledge
of
what
had
been
going
on
for
that
two
and
a
half
years?
i
mean,
it
didn't
come
totally
out
of
the
blue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i
think
your
constitutional
argument
would
be
the
same
if
it
was
six
months
or
a
year,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
contend
that
the
definition
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case
was
unconstitutional
in
any
way?
there
may
be
some
other
cases
the
court
might
define
the
jurisdiction
in
a
way
that
would
be
totally
intolerable,
to
go
investigate
the
soviet
union
or
something.
but
what
does
that
got
to
do
with
the
case
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did
not
expand
the
jurisdiction
to
indict
anyone
except
mr.
olson,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that
is
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
attorney
general
said,
i
think
there
is
probable
cause,
or
reasonable
cause
or
whatever
the
statutory
language
is,
to
investigate
charge
a,
and
he
names
one
statute,
could
the
court
authorize
the
independent
counsel
to
investigate
the
possibility
of
violating
related
statutes?
or
must
he
just
confine
it
to
the
particular
statute--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
is
it
your
submission
that
if
the
attorney
general
gives
a
specific
reference
naming
only
one
criminal
statute
and
one
target,
possible
defendant,
that
any
enlargement
of
that
scope
of
jurisdiction
to
include
a
second
statute
would
violate
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt?
i
really
wonder
about
that
argument.
judges
have
been
appointing
defense
counsel
for
years
to
represent
indigents.
why
is
there
any
greater
appearance
of
impropriety
in
this
situation?
don't
judges
know
that
they
are
separate
from
the
lawyers
that
appear
before
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
see
any
impropriety
at
all
in
our
appointing
counsel
to
represent
an
indigent
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
there
if
you
do
it
on
the
other
side?
what
is
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
many,
many
cases
in
the
state
courts
where
the
special
prosecutors
have
been
appointed
by
judges
when
the
regular
prosecutor
couldn't
handle
the
matter
for
some
reason
or
other.
i
just
don't
see
any
impropriety
involved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
definition
of
jurisdiction,
i
looked
again
here
at
the
reference
by
the
attorney
general.
it
was
to
see
if
there
was
any
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
1505,
1001,
or
any
other
provision
of
criminal
law.
so
you
certainly
can't
say
here
that
it's
the
court
that
gave
it
too
broad
a
definition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
this
case
involves
what
was
done
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
used
the
term
core
function.
one
of
the
questions
is
whether
this
is
a
core
function,
because
in
colonial
times
the
governor
didn't
have
all
that
much
to
do
with
the
appointment
of
prosecutors.
they
were
done
by
justices
of
the
peace,
the
grand
jury
independently,
there
are
a
lot
variety
there,
and
a
lot
of
private
prosecutions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
did
they,
by
using
the
word
executive
power,
necessarily
refer
to
this
power
which
had
not
been
exercised
to
the
same
extent
by
the
chief
executive
of
the
colonies
or
the
crown
in
england
or
any
of
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
rely
on
practice
subsequent
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
rather
than
the
contemporary
practice
for
your
position.
