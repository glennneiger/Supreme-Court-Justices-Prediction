--but
it
wouldn't
have
to,
isn't
that
right?
isn't
there
some
flexibility
there
for
the
special
division
to
determine
its
jurisdiction--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--doesn't
that
raise
some
separation
of
powers
concerns?
the
extent
to
which
the
special
division
is
given
executive
branch
powers--
justice

--ms.
morrison,
are
you
going
to
take
the
position
today
that
under
the
blair
case
this
court
shouldn't
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
did
you
raise
any
objection
in
the
district
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
is
it
perhaps
waived,
and
is
that
something
that
the
court
below
relied
on--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
davidson,
in
your
view
are
there
no
limits
at
all
on
inter-branch
appointments
of
inferior
officers,
from
one
branch
to
another?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
you
really
say
it
is
a
single
function,
because
the
special
division
is
also
given
the
power
to
define
the
jurisdiction,
is
it
not?
and
to
terminate
the
investigation
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
the
concern
is
that
article
iii
limits
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
to
cases
in
controversies,
and
at
least
arguably
this
statute
gives
more
to
the
courts
than
article
iii
case
or
controversy
jurisdiction
would
indicate,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
plus
these
other
aspects,
to
the
extent
they
are
exercised.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
siebold
case
certainly
is
relevant,
isn't
it
here?
were
there
any
executive
functions
involved
in
the
people
appointed
in
the
siebold
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
the
court
thought
it
involved
some
executive
functions,
didn't
it,
didn't
the
court
think
it
involved?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
court
did
recognize
some
inter-branch
appointment
power
in
siebold.
