mr.
michael
davidson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
congress
has
delegated
a
vital
function
to
the
court
in
the
implementation
of
the
ethics
act,
but
has
striven
to
maintain
that
function
within
the
boundaries
of
the
appointments
clause.
one
manner
in
which
the
appointments
clause
carries
forward
the
idea
of
separation
of
powers
is
by
dividing
the
function
of
creating
an
office
under
law,
and
the
power
of
appointing
a
person
to
fill
that
office.
in
the
ethics
act,
the
sole
power
delegated
to
the
court,
of
substance,
is
the
power
of
designating
an
individual
to
fill
an
office
which
has
been
created
by
the
action
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
michael
davidson
and
that
is
the
point
i
wish
to
make,
that
this
arrangement
does
not
violate
that
traditional
approach.
the
function
of
creating
the
office
and
the
function
of
filling
the
office
are
indeed
separate.
counsel
has
described
to
the
court
the
manner
in
which
the
attorney
general--
mr.
michael
davidson
--the
textual
grant
of
authority
to
the
congress
is
indeed
a
broad
grant
of
authority,
and
a
grant
of
authority
which
this
court
recognized
in
the
siebold
case.
but
it
has
been
no
part
of
the
defense
of
this
statute,
that
the
power
is
unbounded.
first,
as
a
practical
matter,
what
the
framers
did
in
the
context
of
the
clause
which
grants
this
discretion
is
that
it
created
substantial
inducements
for
self-restraint.
whenever
the
senate
would
agree
to
a
statute
that
would
vest
appointment
authority
in
the
president
alone,
or
the
heads
of
departments,
or
the
courts
of
law,
it
must
of
necessity
forgo
its
power
to
advise
and
consent.
and
whenever
the
house
and
senate
joined
together
in
a
statute
that
would
vest
power
in
the
courts
of
law,
they
both
must
agree
to
forgo
any
political
influence
over
the
appointment.
but
moreover,
if
one
looks
at
the
history
of
the
utilization
of
this
clause,
from
the
first
idea...
not
accepted,
but
proposed...
to
vest
appointment
authority
in
the
court
to
appoint
the
attorney
general,
from
the
first
enactment
of
authority
of
the
court
to
appoint
marshals
when
the
marshall
appointed
by
the
president
has
a
conflict
of
interest,
to
that
of
appointing
interim
united
states
attorneys,
to
the
enactment
in
siebold
and
to
this
act,
one
will
see
that
the
pattern
that
the
congress
has
historically
recognized
as
a
valid
pattern
is
one
which
recognizes
the
need
for
an
important
degree
of
affinity
between
the
appointment
and
function
and
the
role
of
the
courts.
and
so
we
do
not
come
before
the
court
today
suggesting
that
there
is
an
unlimited,
unbridled
power
of
the
congress
to
reach
out
throughout
the
executive
branch,
but
it
is
one
which
is
carefully
tailored
to
a
function
in
which
the
courts
may
indeed
have
a
recognition
of
the
problem
presented.
a
function
that
is
vested
in
the
court
here
is
a
single
function
of
appointing
a
counsel
who
mirrors
the
essential
characteristic
of
the
judicial
branch.
mr.
michael
davidson
as
the
congress
made
clear
in
the
most
recent
reauthorization
of
the
act
in
1987,
the
power
to
define
the
jurisdiction
of
the
independent
counsel
is
solely
the
power
to
carry
into
the
appointment
order
a
description
of
the
authority
that
is
needed
to
fully
investigate
the
subject
matter
which
the
attorney
general
has
identified.
the
special
division
has
no
power
to
go
beyond
that
subject
matter.
if
the
independent
counsel
uncovers
the
most
incriminating
evidence
about
a
different
subject,
the
independent
counsel's
sole
opportunity
is
to
go
back
to
the
attorney
general
and
to
request
an
expansion
of
jurisdiction,
and
the
attorney
general
has
absolute,
unreviewable
power
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
michael
davidson
as
an
amicus--
mr.
michael
davidson
--i
believe
the
court
did
not,
in
this
case,
exceed
its
jurisdiction.
what
it
sought
to
do--
mr.
michael
davidson
--the
independent
counsel
did
go
to
the
attorney
general,
the
attorney
general
refused
an
expansion,
and
the
special
division,
in
the
opinion
which
was
discussed,
concluded
that
it
was
bound
by
that
limitation,
that
it
could
not
go
beyond
the
attorney
general's
declination
of
any
further
jurisdiction
for
this
independent
counsel.
and
as
for
the
authority
to
terminate
the
investigation,
the
statute
provides
for
three
methods
by
which
an
investigation
may--
mr.
michael
davidson
--the
special
division
interpreted
the
prior
application
of
the
attorney
general
to
include
authority
to
investigate
whether
the
subject
of
the
investigation
had
engaged
in
this
conspiracy
with
others.
it
made
clear
that
because
the
attorney
general
had
decided
there
could
be
no
prosecution
of
the
other
individuals,
that
the
independent
counsel
would
be
barred
from
seeking
an
indictment
of
those
persons.
but
the
text,
the
basis
for
the
special
division's
action
remained:
the
determination
by
the
attorney
general
of
what
the
appropriate
subject
matter
of
the
investigation
would
be.
on
the
question
of--
mr.
michael
davidson
--it
gives
to
the
courts
an
article
ii
appointment
authority,
just
as--
mr.
michael
davidson
--none
of
those
aspects
is
at
the
heart
of
the
necessity
for
judicial
appointment
here.
the
task
which
is
central
to
the
statute
is
the
designation
of
the
impartial
investigator.
the
congress,
in
filling
out
the
details
of
the
statute,
have
provided
for
a
role
which
the
dissenting
judge
described
as
administrator.
some
of
that
indeed
may
be,
if
there
were
ever
a
constitutional
problem,
likely
to
be
severable,
and
the
congress
did
insert
a
strong
severability
in
this
statute.
but
there
is
no
need
to
contemplate
the
exercise
of
that.
the
jurisdiction
is
a
subject
matter
identified
by
the
attorney
general.
and
as
to
the
question
of
termination,
the
congress
made
clear
that
that
is
an
auxiliary
device
or
power
seldom
to
be
used,
and
is
only
the
third
string
in
the
effort
to
make
sure
that
independent
counsel
investigations
did
not
exceed
their
purpose.
the
first
method
is
by
the
independent
counsel's
report.
the
second
method
is
by
the
attorney
general's
request
to
the
court.
we
have
simply
not
approached
the
situation
in
which
any
issue
has
been
ever
presented
about
the
termination
of
investigation,
and
we
assume
that
the
court
would
honor
the
boundaries
which
the
congress
has
placed
on
that
power.
mr.
michael
davidson
i
do
not
think
so,
justice
scalia,
and
for
this
reason:
committees
of
the
congress
have
always
been
able
to
refer
allegations
to
the
department
of
justice,
and
whatever
political
influence
committees
can
bring
to
bear,
they
have
historically
been
able
to
bring
to
bear.
this
statute
does
not
change
that.
rather
it
channels
the
communication
to
a
very
specific
communication
to
the
attorney
general,
who
is
then
given
the
power
to
investigate.
in
1982,
the
congress,
out
of
concern
and
at
the
suggestion
of
the
department
of
justice,
placed
into
the
law
the
obligation
of
the
attorney
general
to
weigh
the
allegations
against
the
established
policies
of
the
department
of
justice.
it
is
not
his
duty
to
simply
ask
for
an
independent
counsel
because
a
committee
of
the
congress
has
asked
for
it,
but
is
to
engage
in
sufficient
investigation
to
determine
whether
there
are
reasonable
grounds.
this
case
is
the
example
of
that:
the
attorney
general's
determination
was
a
discriminating
determination
which
exonerated
two
of
the
possible
subjects
of
this
investigation.
if
i
may
speak
for
a
moment
about
the
removal
provision,
which
we
think
is
quite
central
to
this
litigation.
the
removal
provision
is
one
which
the
congress
has
worked
out
extensively
with
executive
branch.
the
first
proposals
were
to
vest
removal
authority
in
the
court,
but
persuaded
particularly
by
the
american
bar
association,
the
congress
concluded
that
that
might
invest
a
degree
of
supervisory
power
in
the
court
which
belonged
properly
in
an
officer
of
the
executive
branch.
and
so
it
is
the
attorney
general
who
has
the
sole
power
to
remove
an
independent
counsel.
at
first
the
standard
that
the
congress
utilized
was
the
standard
adopted
by
the
executive
branch
in
the
watergate
matter,
where
their
counsel
had
engaged
in
extraordinary
impropriety.
but
when
the
department
of
justice
returned
to
the
congress
in
1982
and
asked
for
a
lowering
of
that
standard
to
good
cause,
the
congress
responded
and
lowered
the
standard
to
good
cause.
and
then
in
1987,
to
avoid
any
question
whether
the
appointing
court
would
have
a
vested
interest
in
maintaining
its
appointee
in
office,
the
congress
removed
authority
to
review
removal
of
an
independent
counsel
from
the
appointing
court
to
the
district
court,
and
it
further
eliminated
a
special
standard
of
review
that
had
been
enacted
earlier
in
the
law
which
would
have
allowed
for
review
of
any
error
of
law
or
fact.
now
the
standard
is
the
standard
that
the
district
court
will
conclude
best
accords
with
statutory
and
constitutional
values
involved.
it
is
the
attorney
general
who
has
the
first
opportunity
to
construe
the
statute.
contrary
to
the
suggestions
that
have
been
made
that
the
attorney
general
would
lack
the
information
upon
which
to
base
his
determinations,
the
statute
clearly
contemplates
that
the
attorney
general
will
make
a
reasonable
and
good
faith
inquiry
to
the
facts,
because
he
must
report
on
the
facts
that
he
has
found
which
would
justify
a
removal.
mr.
michael
davidson
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
davidson
he
gets
that
information
from
the
inquiry
that
he
deems
necessary
to
determine
whether
there
is
good
cause
to
remove
an
independent
counsel.
mr.
michael
davidson
i
presume
he
must
go
to
the
independent
counsel,
and
he
must
ask
the
independent
counsel
questions,
and
he
may
engage
in
any
independent
inquiry
that
he
would
determine
is
necessary
to
fulfill
his
statutory
obligation
to
remove
an
independent
counsel
if
good
cause
exists.
now
there
is
certainly
a
central
idea
to
the
good
cause
removal
provision.
senator
percy
put
it
well
when
he
said
that
the
clause
at
least
prevents
the
removal
of
an
independent
counsel
who
is
too
vigilant
in
pursuing
his
responsibilities.
the
recent
conference
report
stated
the
matter
in
this
way:
that
the
independent
counsel
needs
to
be
able
to
protect
the
integrity
of
his
proceedings.
but
beyond
that,
the
congress
has
not
tried
to
specify
in
the
text
of
the
law
the
exact
parameters
of
the
good
cause
provision.
there
is
indeed
a
message
that
pervades
the
congress's
consideration
of
this
matter.
the
president
is
entitled
to
whatever
constitutionally
based
authority
he
has
and
responsibilities
he
has
to
assure
that
the
independent
counsel,
as
any
other
officer
of
the
government,
stays
within
the
constitutionally
proscribed
parameters
of
his
office,
and
grants
due
recognition
to
the
constitutional
needs
that
the
president
may
express.
if
there
is
ever
an
controversy
about
a
specific
removal,
that
controversy
would
come
back
before
the
court,
and
the
same
constitutional
values
that
are
now
urged
upon
the
court
may
be
heard
by
the
court
at
that
time,
but
also
in
light
of
a
record
which
would
better
illuminate
the
application
of
those
values
to
a
specific
removal.
my
time
has
elapsed.
