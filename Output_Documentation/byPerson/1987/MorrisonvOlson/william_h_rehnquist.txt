we'll
hear
arguments
now
in
no.
87-1279,
alexia
morrison
v.
theodore
b.
olson.
ms.
morrison,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
morrison,
your
opponents
suggest
that
that
is
really
a
very
narrow
kind
of
discretion
that
is
entrusted
to
the
attorney
general,
that
following
the
structure
of
the
statute
he
is
almost
bound
to
recommend
the
creation
of
a
special
prosecutor.
what
is
your
reply
to
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--ms.
morrison,
speaking
of
the
functions
of
the
special
division,
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
that
we
are
reviewing,
that
opinion,
they
point
out
that
the
special
division
had
written
an
opinion
in
this
case.
what
part
of
the
function
did
that
represent?
written
an
opinion
on
the
constitutionality,
really,
of
this
special
prosecutor
statute--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
ms.
morrison,
it
certainly
could
be
argued
that
the
appointment
of
the
prosecutor
is
ordinarily
an
executive
function,
that
it
gives
that
to
the
judicial
branch,
don't
you
think--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
but
our
cases,
i
think,
suggest
it
isn't
just
the
appointments
clause
that
is
involved,
but
that
you
cannot
assign
to
one
branch
certain
functions
that
inherently
belong
to
the
other.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
morrison.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
davidson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
davidson,
you
could
say
that
about
any
cabinet
office
or
any
judicial
appointment:
congress
creates
the
positions,
the
executive
designates
the
people
to
fulfill
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
he
must
report,
you
are
referring
to
the
attorney
general?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
does
the
attorney
general
get
his
information?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
he
go
about
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
davidson.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
martin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position,
mr.
martin,
that
congress
cannot
condition
the
president's
removal
power
if
once
we
find
that
the
office
is
strictly
an
executive
function,
that
congress
cannot
place
any
limits
on
the
president's
power
to
remove
from
that
office?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
you
say
control,
the
president
ordinarily
would
exercise
that
control
by
appointing
a
person
in
the
first
place,
choosing
who
it
was
to
be,
and
removing
the
person
if
the
president
doesn't
like
what
they
are
doing,
yet
you
agree
that
congress
can
place
some
limits
on
the
president's
removal
authority.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
she
can
be
removed
for
good
cause,
can
she
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
specifically
does
the
statute
say
about
the
role
of
the
court
in
defining
the
jurisdiction
of
the
prosecutor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
in
any
way
direct
the
court
to
a
presumption
to
follow
the
recommendation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
martin.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
general
fried.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
whom
were
the
election
inspectors
in
siebold
subordinate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
fried.
ms.
morrison,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
morrison.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
of
the
two
cases
is
no.
87-1279,
morrison
against
olson.
this
case
involves
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
independent
counsel
provisions
of
the
ethics
in
government
act.
this
act
authorizes
the
attorney
general
to
call
for
the
appointment
of
an
independent
counsel
to
investigate
and
if
necessary,
prosecute
certain
high
ranking
government
officials
for
violations
of
certain
federal
laws.
the
independent
counsel
has
significant
prosecutorial
powers.
it
is
appointed,
not
by
the
attorney
general,
but
by
a
special
court
created
for
that
purpose.
this
case
grew
out
of
a
dispute
between
congress
and
the
administration
over
whether
the
environmental
protection
agency
should
have
to
produce
certain
documents
that
have
been
subpoenaed
by
a
house
committee
during
an
investigation
into
the
administration
of
the
superfund
law.
after
this
dispute
was
resolved,
the
house
judiciary
committee
undertook
its
own
investigation
into
the
justice
department's
role
and
the
superfund
dispute.
the
judiciary
committee's
report
suggested
that
appellee
olson,
who
was
then
assistant
attorney
general,
had
testified
falsely
before
the
committee,
and
that
appellees,
schmults
and
dinkins,
were
also
officials
of
the
justice
department
have
obstructed
the
house's
investigation
by
refusing
to
turnover
certain
documents.
the
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
then
requested
the
attorney
general
to
begin
an
investigation
and
to
whether
an
independent
counsel
should
be
appointed
pursuant
to
the
act.
after
a
preliminary
investigation,
the
attorney
general
recommended
that
an
independent
counseil
be
appointed
to
investigate
the
allegations
against
appellee
olson.
the
special
division
of
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
subsequently
appointment
appellant
morrison
as
the
independent
counsel
in
this
case.
in
the
course
of
her
investigation,
she
caused
the
grand
jury
to
issue
subpoenas
to
all
three
appellees.
and
they
moved
in
the
district
court
to
quash
the
subpoenas
claiming
that
the
independent
counsel
provision
of
the
ethics
in
government
act
was
unconstitutional.
the
district
court
upheld
the
act's
constitutionality
and
later
ordered
that
appellees
beheld
in
contempt
for
continuing
to
refuse
to
comply
with
the
subpoenas.
appellees
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
reversed
the
contempt
order
and
ruled
by
a
divided
vote
that
the
independent
counsel
provisions
of
the
act
were
unconstitutional.
appellant
morrison
then
brought
this
appeal
to
us.
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
in
an
opinion
joined
by
seven
members
of
the
court
and
uphold
the
validity
of
the
independent
counsel
provision
of
the
ethics
in
government
act.
we
uphold
first
that
it
does
not
violate
the
appointment
clause
of
article
ii
for
congress
to
have
revest
the
appointment
of
independent
counsels
and
the
special
division.
the
appointment
clause
states
that
congress
made
by
law
vest
the
appointment
such
inferior
officers
as
they
think
proper
in
the
president
alone,
in
the
courts
of
law
or
in
the
heads
of
departments.
in
our
view,
appellant
is
an
inferior
officer
for
purposes
of
this
clause
because
she
is
inferior
in
rank
to
the
attorney
general
who
has
the
power
to
remove
her
for
good
cause
because
she
has
limited
jurisdiction
and
carefully
proscribe
--
prescribe
the
duties
and
because
the
office
of
independent
counsel
is
of
limited
duration
in
tenure.
we
also
find
that
the
appointment
clause
does
not
expressly
prohibit
inter
branch
appointments
of
the
type
created
by
this
act.
we
hold
that
the
powers
vested
in
the
special
division
by
the
act
did
not
run
a
foul
of
article
iii's
limitation
on
the
performance
of
non-judicial
functions
by
federal
judges.
finally,
we
conclude
that
the
act
does
not
violate
the
separation
of
powers,
principles
embedded
in
the
constitution
by
impermissibly
interfering
with
the
executive's
discharge
of
his
function
as
the
allocated
by
the
constitution.
the
constitution
we
hold
does
not
prevent
congress
from
restricting
the
attorney
general's
power
to
fire
an
independent
counsel
to
those
situations
in
which
good
cause
is
shown.
here,
congress
is
not
attempted
to
insert
itself
in
the
removal
of
executive
officials
as
was
the
case
in
the
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
bowsher
against
synar
and
myers
against
the
united
states.
we
reaffirm
the
holding
of
the
myers
case
that
congress
may
not
have
grandiose
its
own
powers
by
becoming
involved
in
the
decision
to
remove
an
executive
official.
but
we
do
not
think
that
in
this
case
the
good
cause
removal
restriction
contained
in
the
act
unduly
interferes
with
the
presence
exercise
of
executive
power
and
its
constitutional
duty
to
ensure
that
the
laws
are
faithfully
executed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
that
case.
