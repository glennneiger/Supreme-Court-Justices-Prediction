mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
raise
a
number
of
particular
objections
to
the
independent
counsel
statute:
to
the
total
exclusion
of
the
president
from
her
appointment,
from
the
very
significant
limitation
on
the
president's
power
to
direct
and
remove
the
independent
counsel,
and
on
the
inappropriate
involvement
of
the
judiciary
in
the
appointment,
direction,
and
removal
of
the
independent
counsel.
but
our
central
objection
is
that
this
statute
strips
the
president
of
purely
executive
function,
criminal
prosecution
in
an
important
class
of
cases,
and
lodges
that
function
in
one
almost
wholly
untethered
to
the
president,
and
at
the
same
time
it
deprives
the
congress
of
its
power
of
advice
and
consent,
but
worse,
it
absolves
the
congress
of
its
weightiest
and
most
painful
duty,
which
is
the
scrutiny
of
the
executive
branch,
backed
up
by
the
painful
duty
of
impeachment.
now
the
appointments
clause
problem,
to
our
mind,
is
simply
the
most
extreme
of
the
constitutional
anomalies
in
this
statute.
it
was
justice
white,
in
a
separate
opinion
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
who
said
the
appointment
power
was
a
major
building
block
fitted
into
the
constitutional
structure.
by
removing
that
block,
this
is
only
one
of
the
several
ways
in
which
this
statute
deforms
that
structure.
now,
one
of
the
reasons
that
are
offered
for
these
constitutional
anomalies,
the
importance
to
the
public
to
feel
that
executive
officers
would
be
investigated
and
prosecuted
with
vigor
and
impartiality.
and
the
instance
which
the
appellant
and
all
of
her
amici
urge
is
the
watergate
episode.
that
is
the
episode
which
is
thought
to
teach
the
necessity
for
this
provision.
with
respect
we
submit
that
that
episode
teaches
the
exact
opposite
lesson.
true,
the
dismissal
of
special
prosecutor
cox
was
regrettable,
but
it
was
not
a
constitutional
catastrophe.
had
special
prosecutor
jaworski
been
dismissed,
had
the
watergate
task
force
been
disbanded,
had
those
prosecutions
been
abandoned,
that
would
have
been
another
matter.
but
everyone
knows
that
those
prosecutions
proceeded
to
their
denouement
without
missing
a
beat.
and
they
did
so
not
because
of
jury
rigged
constitutional
innovations
such
as
we
have
here,
but
because
of
public
pressure
and
the
long,
deep
shadow
of
congress's
power
of
impeachment.
that
is
our
constitutional
system,
and
that
is
precisely
how
our
framers
envisaged
that
the
matter
should
work.
to
be
sure,
it
did
not
work
without
struggle
and
strain,
but
it
is
a
central
fallacy
of
this
statute
to
think
that
a
supremely
political
object...
and
i
use
the
word
politics
in
its
high
sense,
of
those
occasions
which
concentrate
the
moral
and
practical
sense
of
the
people...
can
be
accomplished
without
politics,
that
in
some
sense
it
can
be
turned
over
to
serene
persons
operating
outside
of
the
political
process,
platonic
guardians
of
sort.
now,
in
humphrey's
executor
the
court
described
an
appropriate
occasion
for
such
percipiences.
it
said
that
it's
appropriate
to
have
a
commission
whose
duties
are
neither
political
nor
executive,
like
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
and
that
commission
can
then
exercise
the
trained
judgment
of
a
body
of
experts.
that
is
not
what
the
special
prosecutor,
what
the
independent
counsel
does,
and
it
is
profoundly
wrong
to
absolve
the
political
branches
of
their
responsibilities,
and
hand
over
those
responsibilities
to
persons
who
act
totally
untethered
to
any
politically
responsible
person.
this
temptation
is
a
temptation
to
which
the
congress
yielded
on
one
other
occasion,
in
the
gramm-rudman
trigger
mechanism.
and
this,
it
seems
to
us,
is
a
more
severe
and
a
more
dangerous
instance
of
that
fallacious
view
of
the
constitution
because
the
liberty
of
the
subject
is
involved.
now
turning
to
the
question
of
the
appointments
clause
and
who
is
subject
to
presidential
appointment,
the
appellant
and
her
amici
relentlessly
misunderstand
our
submission.
we
do
not
say
that
every
subordinate
person
is
an
inferior
officer.
i
do
not
know
whether
i
am
principal
officer
or
an
inferior
officer,
but
it
is
quite
clear
and
it
is
made
clear
by
statute
that
i
am
subordinate
to
the
attorney
general
and
to
the
president.
what
we
say
is
that
subordinancy
is
a
necessary
condition
for
a
person
being
an
inferior
officer,
and
it
is
hard
to
imagine
any
officer
in
the
government
who
is
less
subordinate
in
her
function
than
is
the
independent
counsel.
the
independent
counsel
is
considerably
less
subordinate
than
am
i,
and
than
is
the
attorney
general
of
the
president.
mr.
charles
fried
they
were
subordinate
to
the
court,
i
suppose,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
as
to
the
siebold
case,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
functions
they
were
performing
were
functions
which
it
was
recognized
could
be
performed
by
the
congress
itself.
which
brings
me
to
justice
blackmun's
question
regarding
the
librarian
of
congress,
and
one
might
add
to
the
librarian
of
congress,
the
public
printer,
and
the
comptroller
general.
mr.
charles
fried
and
the
architect
of
the
capitol,
all
of
whom
are
appointed
by
the
president.
it
is
not
entirely
clear
whether
they
are
officers
of
the
united
states
or
officers
of
congress,
but
if
they
are
officers
of
the
united
states,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
appointments
clause,
as
it
relates
to
inferior
officers,
must
lodge
that
appointment
either
in
the
president
or
in
the
courts
of
law.
there
is
no
alternative
so
there's
no
particular
anomaly
or
any
particular
problem
that
congress
decided
to
lodge
the
appointment
of
the
librarian
of
congress
in
the
president.
so
i
think
those
particular
group
of
cases
do
not
cause
the
difficulty.
it
does
seem
that
by
allowing
this
kind
of
cross
branch
appointment,
we
cause
the
question
of
who
is
an
inferior
officer
and
who
is
a
principal
officer
to
bear
far
too
much
weight.
it
really
is
not
particularly
important
whether
the
solicitor
general
is
an
inferior
or
a
principal
officer,
an
inferior
officer
like
the
cadet
in
perkins
who
figures
so
prominently
in
the
appellant's
brief.
it
isn't
important
because
it's
quite
clear
that
the
solicitor
general,
like
the
cadet
in
perkins,
is
wholly
subordinate
to
a
person
in
the
presidential
chain
of
command.
it
is
only
when
you
have
cross
branch
appointments
that
it
becomes
crucially
important
to
decide
whether
a
particular
person
is
important
enough,
subordinate
enough
to
be
subject
to
the
inferior
officer
clause
or
the
principal
officer
clause.
we
submit
that
these
are
problems
which
the
framers
did
not
intend
us
to
face
and
that
we
need
not
face,
because
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
is
simply
to
recognize
and
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
each
of
the
branches,
and
not
countenance
a
system
which
would
allow
the
executive
branch
to
be
shattered
into
a
thousand
small
offices,
each
of
whom
would
be
appointed
by
courts
of
law.
now,
there's
one
further
point
that
needs
to
be
mentioned
regarding
the
control
of
the
independent
counsel
by
the
attorney
general.
it
does
seem
to
us
that
the
picture
of
the
prosecutorial
function
which
the
appellant
and
her
amici
offer
is
one
which
is
scarcely
recognizable
to
anybody
who
has
ever
wielded
that
power.
i
think
that
power
is
best
described
by
mr.
justice
jackson
when
he
was
attorney
general
in
the
attorney
general's
amicus
brief.
that
is
not
a
power,
the
prosecutor's
power
is
not
one
which
is
exhausted
by
viewing
her
as
an
automaton
who
mechanically
processes
evidence
and
law
by
something
called
a
bureaucratic
set
of
policies.
do
we
prosecute
for
a
felony
when
more
than
one
ounce
of
marijuana
is
involved.
what
is
involved
is
judgment.
what
is
involved
is
discretion.
that
was
the
lesson
which
justice
jackson
taught
in
that
splendid
address
to
young
prosecutors.
and
that
kind
of
judgment,
that
kind
of
discretion,
we
urge,
is
a
kind
of
discretion
which
can
only
be
safely
lodged
in
somebody
who
is
responsible
to
an
elected
official,
an
elected
official
who
if
he
does
not
properly
control
that
responsibility
is
subject
to
congressional
oversight
and
if
need
be,
impeachment.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
