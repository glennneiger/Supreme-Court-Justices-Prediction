mr.
davidson,
following
up
on
justice
stevens
comment,
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
federal
courts
appointing
interim
united
states
attorneys?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it's
still
an
inter-branch
appointment.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
questioning
the
constitutionality
of
that
as
a
theoretical
matter?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
other
words,
who
appoints
the
librarian
of
congress--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--well,
the
president,
of
course.
and
it
is
confirmed
by
the
senate.
the
very
title
of
the
librarian
of
congress
would
indicate
this
is
an
inter-branch
appointment,
also.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
my
only
point
is
that
our
history
in
practice
is
rife
with
examples
of
inter-branch
appointments.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
the
architect
of
the
capitol.
