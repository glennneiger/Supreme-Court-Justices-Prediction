ms.
alexia
morrison
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
you
in
this
matter
concerns
whether
on
its
face
the
independent
counsel
provisions
of
the
ethics
in
government
act
run
afoul
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
this
question
was
raised
by
the
three
appellees
in
this
matter
when
each
was
subpoenaed
to
give
evidence
before
a
federal
grand
jury.
that
grand
jury
was
considering
matters
covered
by
title
vi
of
the
ethics
in
government
act,
and
had
been
referred
in
1986
by
the
attorney
general
for
treatment
under
the
independent
counsel
provisions.
the
appellees
moved
to
quash
the
subpoenas
on
the
basis
that
title
vi
was
unconstitutional.
the
district
court
disagreed
and
ordered
compliance
with
the
subpoenas.
when
the
appellees
refused,
they
were
held
in
contempt.
upon
review,
a
divided
panel
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
overruled
the
district
court's
finding,
and
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
a
number
of
grounds.
indeed,
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
the
court
looked
beyond
the
facts
presented
by
this
case
and
reached
out
for
facts
not
before
it
in
order
to
found
a
basis
for
finding
constitutional
problems
with
the
statute.
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1978
after
several
years
of
congressional
hearings
and
lengthy
consideration
of
its
provisions.
it
has
been
reauthorized
twice:
in
1983
and
again
in
1987.
in
each
case
some
fine
tuning
has
been
done
to
the
statute's
provisions,
but
its
basic
approach
has
remained
consistent
over
the
last
decade.
with
each
passage
of
the
act,
continuing
it
for
five
year
terms,
the
congressional
fine
tuning
has
been
done
with
insights
provided
from
those
who
have
observed
operations
under
the
act,
including
the
united
states
department
of
justice.
thus
title
vi
comes
before
you
having
three
times
undergone
bicameral
passage
in
the
legislature
and
presentment
to
the
president.
on
each
occasion,
the
then
sitting
president
has
signed
the
bill
into
law,
albeit
on
the
last
occasion
with
expressed
reservations
about
the
act's
constitutionality.
having
made
its
legislative
choices
in
enacting
the
bill
on
three
different
occasions,
congress's
role
in
the
independent
counsel
process
ends.
it
has
reserved
for
itself
no
part
in
the
implementation
of
the
independent
counsel
process.
so
unlike
the
cases
presented
to
this
court
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
ins
v.
chadha,
and
myers
v.
united
states,
there
is
no
concern
here
about
congressional
aggrandizement
of
its
powers.
the
statute
is
triggered
when
the
attorney
general
receives
specific,
credible
information
that
one
of
the
high
administration
officials
covered
by
the
act's
provisions
has
committed
a
crime.
if
the
attorney
general
determines
in
his
own
unreviewable
discretion
that
the
specific,
credible
information
constitutes
grounds
to
investigate,
he
causes
a
preliminary
investigation
to
be
conducted
under
the
act.
if
as
a
result
of
that
preliminary
investigation
he
finds
there
are
no
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
further
investigation
or
prosecution
is
warranted,
he
reports
that
finding
to
the
court,
and
his
final
determination
on
the
subject
ends
the
matter.
the
court
has
no
ability
to
appoint
an
independent
counsel.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
he
finds
that
there
are
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
further
investigation
or
prosecution
is
warranted
in
one
of
these
matters
where
the
statute
imports
a
conflict--
ms.
alexia
morrison
--the
statute
leaves
the
matter
entirely
within
his
discretion.
in
fact
history,
we
would
suggest,
supports
the
notion
that
the
attorney
general
not
only
is
able
under
the
statute
to
refuse
to
appoint
an
independent
counsel
where
matters
have
been
brought
to
his
attention
under
the
statute,
but
in
fact
on
repeated
occasions
attorney
generals
have
refused
to
appoint
an
independent
counsel.
the
matter
comes
to
him,
as
would
any
allegations
of
criminal
misconduct,
and
he
uses,
pursuant
to
the
statute,
the
same
standards
and
the
same
policies
that
he
would
apply
to
the
review
of
any
matter
if
he
were
trying
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
cause
a
full-blown
grand
jury
investigation
to
be
conducted
within
the
department
of
justice.
ms.
alexia
morrison
that's
true.
ms.
alexia
morrison
it
would
very
much
depend
on
the
facts
before
him,
your
honor.
in
this
matter
the
congressional,
as
interpreted
by
the
department
of
justice,
encompassed
no
fewer
than
four
individuals
as
to
whom
the
congress
believed
that
their
processes
had
been
violated.
ms.
alexia
morrison
under
the
statute,
and
it
would
seem
to
us
as
a
matter
of
basic,
inherent
powers,
any
citizen,
any
body,
any
entity
would
be
free
under
the
statute
to
bring
their
concerns
about
administration
misconduct
to
the
attention
of
the
attorney
general,
and
command
thereby,
simply
by
making
allegations,
that
the
review
required
by
the
statute
take
place.
ms.
alexia
morrison
the
attorney
general
has,
under
the
statute
as
it
existed
when
the
matter
before
the
court
was
referred
for
independent
counsel
treatment,
a
total
of
90
days
within
which
to
proceed
with
the
preliminary
investigation.
so
that
information
coming
to
him
would
trigger
the
commencement
of
that
90
day
period.
indeed,
under
the
1987
reauthorization,
the
attorney
general
gets
an
additional
15
day
period
within
which
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
reason
to
even
conduct
a
preliminary
investigation,
and
then
the
90
day
period
begins
to
run.
and
the
statute,
in
all
of
its
incarnations,
has
made
provision
for
those
occasions
on
which
90
days
does
not
prove
adequate,
for
the
attorney
general
to
make
an
application,
and
he
is
allowed,
under
the
statute,
to
go
to
the
court
and
seek
an
additional
60
days
where
he
needs
that
additional
time
to
make
his
determination
under
the
statute.
indeed,
it
is
probably
worth
noting
on
that
point
that
in
the
very
matter
before
the
court,
the
attorney
general
did
not
comply
with
the
90
day
requirement
that
he
act
on
the
allegations
referred
to
him
by
the
house
judiciary
committee.
despite
that
fact
the
90th
day
passed,
and
nothing
happened.
nothing
occurred
in
this
matter
until
the
attorney
general,
after
the
90
day
period,
made
his
reference
to
the
court
in
which
he
asked
that
only
one
of
a
number
of
people
covered
by
that
house
judiciary
committee
report
actually
be
subject
to
independent
counsel
treatment.
once
the
attorney
general
determines
that
an
independent
counsel
should
be
appointed,
he
makes
a
report
to
the
court
providing
sufficient
information
to
the
court
so
that
it
can
fulfill
its
appointing
function.
save
for
this
appointing
function
thus
invoked
by
the
attorney
general,
the
court,
like
the
congress,
plays
no
further
role
in
the
implementation
of
the
statute.
granted
as
an
incident
of
the
appointment
power,
the
court
defines
the
independent
counsel's
jurisdiction.
this,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
has
been
the
subject
of
the
department
of
justice
of
a
specific
jurisdictional
recommendation
in
the
report
that
goes
from
the
attorney
general
to
the
court.
in
the
case
before
the
court
here,
the
special
division
of
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
actually
adopted
almost
verbatim
the
jurisdictional
recommendation
made
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
report
seeking
an
independent
counsel
to--
ms.
alexia
morrison
--yes,
your
honor.
under
the
statute
the
court
is
given
the
information
made
available
by
the
attorney
general,
but
is
also
empowered
to
define
jurisdiction
within
the
bounds
established
by
that
report.
ms.
alexia
morrison
we
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
that
is
not
an
executive
branch
power
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
a
substantive
part
of
the
investigation
conducted.
the
court
plays
no
role
in
formulating
the
investigative
plan,
if
you
will,
in
determining
at
whom
the
independent
counsel
is
look:
that
is
determined
by
the
attorney
general.
the
court,
in
this
statute,
is
given
the
power
to
limit,
to
place
bounds
on
the
arena
within
which
the
independent
counsel
may
investigate.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
it
would
have
been
perfectly
proper
had
the
congress
determined
that
once
an
attorney
general
determined
a
matter
was
appropriate
for
independent
counsel
investigation,
the
congress
might
have
provided
that
the
court
simply
appoint
an
appropriate
person
to
conduct
the
investigation,
and
to
allow
that
person,
as
any
normal
prosecutor
would,
to
take
the
matter
and
follow
the
investigation
where
it
lead.
that
is
what
happens
in
hundreds
of
federal
prosecutor's
offices
around
the
country.
a
matter
comes
in,
and
the
investigation
proceeds.
but
congress
decided
not
to
follow
that
process,
but
rather
to
have
neither
the
attorney
general,
who
by
statute
has
a
conflict
here,
nor
the
independent
counsel
as
to
whom
they
wanted
to
set
some
definitions
or
boundaries
to
make
the
determination
of
exactly
what
the
outside
parameters
of
the
investigation
would
be.
but
in
this
case
they
interposed
the
court
and
asked
that
the
court
review
the
matters
brought
to
its
attention
by
the
attorney
general,
and
fashion
a
reasonable
jurisdictional
mandate,
allowing--
ms.
alexia
morrison
--there
is
a
provision
in
the
statute,
your
honor,
which
would
allow...
and
this
provision
has
not
yet
been
used
and
indeed
may
never...
the
court
having
fashioned
the
appointment
to
say,
my
appointment
authority
has
now
been
substantially
completed,
the
independent
counsel's
task
appears
to
me
to
be
conducted--
ms.
alexia
morrison
--the
statute
specifically
provides
that
the
court
can
do
it
on
the
recommendation
of
the
attorney
general,
or
on
its
own
if
it
were
to
come
into
possession
of
information--
ms.
alexia
morrison
--concerning
the
progress
of
the
investigation,
no,
your
honor.
in
this
case
we
did
re-approach
the
special
division
of
the
court
to
ask
for
jurisdiction
that
would
encompass
two
additional
individuals,
and
that
request
was
denied.
but
in
the
ordinary
course,
your
honor,
removal
under
the
statute
occurs
solely
and
exclusively
at
the
hand
of
the
attorney
general.
terminating
the
office,
we
would
submit,
was
a
way
for
congress
to
address
its
concern
that
there
be
no
possibility
that
someone
appointed
as
an
independent
counsel
would
overstay
their
welcome.
again,
this
is
a
provision
that
has
not
been
used
and
may
never
be
used.
removal,
in
the
sense
of
being
terminated
for
something
of
substance,
is
an
issue
that
is
left
solely
to
the
attorney
general
under
the
statute,
albeit
that
his
ability
to
remove
under
the
statute
is
limited
to
for
cause--
ms.
alexia
morrison
--it
is
subject
to
review,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
alexia
morrison
as
the
statute
existed
at
the
time
of
the
appointment
in
the
current
matter,
it
was
lodged
in
the
special
division.
subsequently,
in
the
1987
amendments,
that
review
has
been
lodged,
as
it
normally
would,
under
an
administrative
procedure
act
matter
in
the
district
court.
ms.
alexia
morrison
well,
it
is
interesting
because
the
constitutional
question
that
the
special
division
addressed
in
the
matter
was
actually
raised
by
the
department
of
justice
in
connection
with
the
review
by
the
court
of
our
request
for
additional
jurisdiction.
we
went
to
the
attorney
general
initially,
and
asked
that
our
jurisdictional
mandate
be
expanded
to
include
additional
individuals.
when
that
request
was
turned
down,
we
took
the
provision
in
section
594(e)
of
the
statute,
which
permitted
us
to
address
that
question,
to
the
court
and
asked
the
court
to
review
the
matter
in
the
connection
of
its
role
as
the
definer
of
jurisdiction,
the
person
who
is
setting
the
parameters
for
the
appointed
individual
to
pursue.
under
594(e),
the
court
took
not
only
our
request
but
also
a
submission
from
the
department
of
justice,
and
it
ultimately
turned
out
submissions
in
sort
of
amicus
capacity
from
the
two
individuals
as
to
whom
we
sought
to
gain
jurisdiction,
and
considered
all
of
those
matters
in
connection
with
its
review
of
the
scope
of
our
jurisdiction.
in
connection
with
the
submission
made
by
the
department
of
justice,
they
raised
constitutional
questions
about
the
statute,
particularly
as
it
would
be
affected
by
the
interpretation
that
we
were
asking
the
court
to
place
on
section
594(e).
and
so
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
before
the
court
in
connection
with
its
consideration
of
our
request
which
related
to
jurisdiction.
the
court's
writing
of
an
opinion,
we
would
suggest,
simply
is
a
way
for
it
to
explain
and
make
a
record
of
how
it
addressed
that
jurisdictional
question.
ms.
alexia
morrison
we
are
very
concerned
about
that
issue,
your
honor,
because
of
the
impact
that
we
foresee
the
appellate
court's
ruling
on
blair,
particularly
as
they
hold
ryan
affects
the
blair
holding.
we
are
concerned
about
how
that
might
impact
federal
law
enforcement
in
grand
jury
proceedings
across
the
country,
and
so
we--
ms.
alexia
morrison
--we
did
not.
ms.
alexia
morrison
the
court
below
did
find
that
by
not
raising
the
issue
in
the
district
court,
that
we
had
somehow
waived
that
jurisdictional
question.
the
case
that
they
relied
on,
the
air
florida
case,
is
one
that
we
suggest
is
not
appropriate
or
not
dispositive
of
the
issue,
because
there
there
was
a
question
relating
to
a
substantive
claim,
a
new
substantive
claim
that
was
sought
to
be
raised
on
appeal.
in
a
case
where
the
question
is
jurisdictional,
we
would
suggest
that
that
is
something
that
can
be
reviewed
by
any
court
at
any
point
in
the
proceedings
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
is
appropriate
to
proceed.
we
would
obviously
prefer
that
this
court
reach
the
constitutional
question
in
this
matter.
it
would
be
of
benefit
to
us
and
to
everybody
else
who
is
operating
under
the
act
to
have
the
question
resolved,
and
not
to
have
to
proceed
any
further
with
the
constitutional
question
hanging
over
their
investigations.
however,
our
concern
that
the
appellate
court's
reading
of
ryan
and
its
fairly
broad
inroads
on
blair,
as
they
read
it,
is
a
subject
that
concerns
us
and
caused
us
to
raise
the
question.
with
respect
to
any
investigation
conducted
under
the
statute,
the
independent
counsel
in
three
critical
respects
continues
to
be
a
member
of
the
executive
branch.
pursuant
to
the
statute,
independent
counsel
are
required
to
follow
the
established
policies
of
the
department
of
justice.
independent
counsel
are
removable,
albeit
only
for
cause,
but
nonetheless
are
removable
only
by
the
attorney
general.
as
i
indicated
before,
no
independent
counsel
is
subjected
to
direct
or
even
indirect
supervision
by
either
the
judicial
or
legislative
branches.
the
department's
routine
is
interrupted
in
criminal
investigations
under
this
statute
only
in
a
very
narrow
number
of
cases.
their
policies
continue
to
apply
to
any
investigation
conducted,
and
if
there
are
any
court
proceedings--
ms.
alexia
morrison
--yes,
the
statute
says,
that
except
where
not
possible,
the
independent
counsel
shall
follow
the
written
or
other
established
procedures
or
policies
of
the
department
of
justice.
that
is
the
same
mandate
that
is
sent
by
the
department
in
its
own
guidelines
to
u.s.
attorneys
operating
all
over
the
country.
that
is,
it
is
a
recognition
by
congress,
as
there
is
a
recognition
within
the
department,
that
the
peculiar
facts
or
peculiar
situations
may
render
it
impossible
in
a
given
case
to
follow
a
particular
guideline.
for
example:
in
the
situation
where
an
independent
counsel
is
conducting
an
investigation
or
prosecution,
it
may
be
impossible
to
follow
those
guidelines
that
require
specific
reporting
up
a
particular
chain
of
command
of
events
leading
to
the
use
of
a
statute
that
is
specifically
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
independent
counsel
under
the
statute.
but
the
words
of
the
statute
are
clear,
it
is
a
mandate
except
where
not
possible.
the
attorney
general
and
the
solicitor
general
are
specifically
empowered
under
the
act
to
appear
in
any
court
proceeding
in
which
an
independent
counsel
appears,
to
urge
their
view
of
the
law
on
that
body.
the
attorney
general
has
the
ability
and
the
obligation,
if
he
finds
that
an
independent
counsel
is
proceeding
less
than
faithfully
in
executing
the
independent
counsel
provisions,
to
step
in
and
cause
that
independent
counsel's
removal.
like
every
federal
prosecutor,
the
independent
counsel
can
only
indict
by
use
of
a
grand
jury.
the
subject
of
the
investigation
retains
throughout
the
entire
process
all
of
the
substantive
and
procedural
rights
that
are
available
to
any
defendant
or
person
being
investigated
in
connection
with
criminal
allegations.
throughout
the
process,
the
president
retains
the
total
ability
to
determine
the
final
outcome
of
the
process
by
his
exercise
of
the
pardon
power.
ms.
alexia
morrison
there
is
a
united
states
attorney's
manual,
your
honor,
that
takes
up
a
full
shelf
in
the
library.
one
full
volume
of
which
is
devoted
entirely
to
criminal
matters
that
address
itself
to
everything
from
the
considerations
to
be
applied
when
immunity
is
granted,
to
how
particular
witnesses
are
to
be
treated,
in
connection
with
determining
evidence,
the
substantive
requirements
for
different
criminal
offenses.
there
is
also
a
principles
of
federal
prosecution
manual,
which
is
made
available
publicly,
as
is
the
u.s.
attorney's
manual.
so
there
is
an
extensive
and
comprehensive
set
of
materials
that
constrain
the
independent
counsel's
exercise
of
discretion
in
even
the
arenas
involving
witnesses,
much
less
decisions
to
bring
substantive
charges.
ms.
alexia
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
in
a
couple
of
places
the
same
experience
that
we
have
had,
which
is
there
continues
to
be
communication
between
independent
counsel
and
career
staff
at
the
department
of
justice
on
matters
of
policy
and
procedure,
even
where
there
are
not
written
guidelines.
that
is,
if
a
question
arises
about
how
to
handle
a
particular
matter,
there
is
communication
with
career
prosecutors
who
may
have
addressed
the
issue
before,
and
their
input
is
welcomed
in
connection
with
making
decisions.
ms.
alexia
morrison
we
haven't
had
to
confront
that
question
in
our
case,
but
where
the
matter
has
been
referred
by
the
attorney
general
for
independent
counsel
treatment,
i
assume
that
at
least
in
the
regard
that
you
are
addressing,
the
attorney
general
would
have
made
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
to
proceed,
the
kind
of
preliminary
check
on
conflicting
executive
or
departmental
interests
that
would
be
applied
by
the
deputy
attorney
general
under
that
standard.
the
minor
deviations
from
the
norm
that
the
independent
counsel
provisions
put
in
place
are
really
moved
or
motivated
by
two
mutually
reinforcing
purposes.
both
of
which
were
considered
by
congress
at
the
time
that
it
enacted
the
legislation.
one
precludes
the
appearance
or
reality
of
a
conflict
of
interest
that
can
lessen
public
confidence
in
federal
law
enforcement.
the
second
provides
the
subject
of
an
independent
counsel
inquiry
protection
against
the
possibility
that
a
prosecutor,
an
attorney
general,
a
department
of
justice
anxious
to
prove
its
own
absence
of
conflict
and
neutrality
on
the
issue
would
bend
over
backwards
in
order
to
appear
unconflicted
in
the
matter.
it
also
gives...
the
statute
also
gives
the
added
benefit
to
subjects
of
independent
counsel
inquiry...
which
has
resulted
in
the
majority
of
investigations
to
date,
i
might
note...
of
an
independent
and
therefor
much
more
meaningful
clearance
or
vindication
of
allegations
that
ultimately
prove
to
be
unwarranted.
given
the
limited
occasions
on
which
the
statute's
provisions
are
invoked
and
the
care
with
which
congress
has
circumscribed
the
number
and
nature
of
the
limitations
on
complete
executive
control
of
independent
counsel
matters,
the
question
arises,
does
the
independent
counsel
process
somehow
offend
the
constitutional
brand
of
executive
authority
to
the
president.
we
submit
that
it
does
not.
the
first
and
most
important
element
is
one
i've
talked
about
before,
that
is,
that
the
statute
grants
no
piece
of
executive
power
to
either
the
judicial
or
legislative
branch.
there
is
no
control
in
either
of
those--
ms.
alexia
morrison
--the
identity
of
the
prosecutor,
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
something
that
is
given
to
the
judicial
branch,
although
that,
it
seems
to
us,
recalls
the
appointments
clause
issue,
which
is
addressed
both
in
the
opinion
below
and
by
the
opponents
in
this
matter.
we
would
suggest
that
the
specific
provisions
of
the
appointments
clause,
far
from
raising
concerns
of
constitutional
nature
in
this
case,
actually
directly
address
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
prosecution
function...
in
the
one
case
example
caused
by
the
independent
counsel
laws...
actually
speaks
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
rather
than
against
it.
the
appointments
clause
specifically
delegates
to
congress
authority
to
make
a
determination
where
inferior
officers
are
concerned
as
to
whether
or
not
their
appointment
properly
belongs
in
the
president
alone,
under
the
principal
officer
treatment
requiring
both
president
and
senate
to
participate,
or
in
the
department
heads
or
the
courts
of
law.
ms.
alexia
morrison
that
is
correct,
and
we
contend
that
none
of
that
has
happened
here,
your
honor.
that
because
the
specific
appointments
clause
question
is
addressed
in
the
constitution
itself,
and
that
congress
is
given
the
discretion
and
authority
to
do
what
it
has
done
in
this
legislation,
that
the
appointment
question
is
addressed
specifically
by
the
constitution
and
therefore
is
not
a
problem,
and
that
after
that,
the
analysis
applied
by
this
court
in
other
cases
involving
law
enforcement
as
an
insulateable
aspect
of
the
executive
function,
that
those
two
concepts
address
the
separation
of
powers
concerns.
indeed,
in
siebold
this
court
approved
judicial
appointment
of
clearly
executive
officers
performing
clearly
executive
functions.
that
case
also
provided
approval
for
a
statute
that
provided
for
no
executive
or
presidential
supervision
or
direction
of
the
officers
appointed
by
the
court.
ms.
alexia
morrison
they
may
not
have
been,
although
even
the
dissent
in
that
case,
your
honor,
speaks
about
the
weightiness
of
the
nature
of
the
executive
function,
talking
about
how
that
statute
went
further
than
any
statute
to
date
at
the
time
of
the
decision
in
siebold
in
granting
law
enforcement
or
executive
functions.
ms.
alexia
morrison
i
think
that
would
create
more
problems.
ms.
alexia
morrison
but
of
course
that
contention,
your
honor,
flies
in
the
face
of
a
long
tradition
of
judicial
appointment
of
attorneys
to
represent
parties
before
them,
and
in
those
cases
there
is
inherently
the
fact
that
the
attorneys
being
appointed
to
handle
matters
that
may
well
end
up
in
that
courthouse
as
litigated
matters.
the
suggestion
in
the
statute
is
that
courts
participating
in
the
appointment
cannot
in
any
future
way
participate
in
review
of
any
independent
counsel
prosecutions
or
cases
that
flow
from
the
appointment,
and
so
there
is
a
greater
insulation
there
than
there
would
be
even
in
the
normal
case
of
court
appointment.
ms.
alexia
morrison
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and...
on
the
appointments.
ms.
alexia
morrison
well,
there
is
a
case
in
this
court
in
which
that
very
process
was
approved,
your
honor.
so
that
in
our
view
the
separation
of
powers
concerns
have
been
addressed
by
this
court
in
siebold,
in
humphrey's
executor,
in
wiener,
and
we
believe
that
the
principles
there
cast
a
much
broader
net
than
the
one
sought
by
the
statute
here.
that
is,
that
in
an
individual
prosecution
where
the
executive
has
a
conflict,
there
can
be
some
measure
of
insulation
of
that
investigation,
and
the
limited
prosecutorial
discretion
having
to
be
exercised
in
that
case
from
pure
presidential
control.
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
alexia
morrison
mr.
martin
indicated
in
his
argument
that
the
case
that
he
thought
might
be
important
to
the
court
discussed
the
president's
pardon
power
that's
constitutionally
textually
committed
to
the
president
personally.
in
this
matter,
we
are
talking
about
enforcement
powers
that
are
created
by
statute,
and
congress
has
found
within
its
appropriate
power,
we
think,
that
individual
matters
of
criminal
law
enforcement
should
not
be
matters
of
politics.
unless
there
are
further
questions?
ms.
alexia
morrison
i
believe
the
statute
says,
except
when
not
possible.
ms.
alexia
morrison
and
i
made
reference
before
to
the
fact
that
there
are
certain
policies
within
the
department's
written
guidelines
that
require
checking
up
the
chain
of
command.
some
of
those
would
be
checks
that
would
not
be
possible
under
the
independent
counsel
statute
where
the
independent
counsel
is
acting
in
lieu
of
the
attorney
general
for
purposes
of
let's
say
an
immunity
grant.
so
that
in
those
instances,
it
would
not
be
possible
to
follow
the
established
policies
of
the
department.
