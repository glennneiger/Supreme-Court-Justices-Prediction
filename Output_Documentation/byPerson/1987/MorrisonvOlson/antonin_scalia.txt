justice
antonin
scalia
--except
that
he
doesn't
have
an
unlimited
time
period
in
which
to
conduct
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
quite
short.
you
have
said
that
congress's
function
is
at
an
end
and
that
it
has
not
part
in
the
implementation
of
the
law,
but
in
this
case
congress
or
members
of
congress
did
indeed
send
a
letter
to
the
attorney
general,
did
they
not,
asserting
that
there
were
reasonable
grounds
to
investigate.
what
does
the
attorney
general
have
to
do
when
the
alleged
defense
consists
of
false
testimony
before
the
congress,
and
he
gets
a
letter
from
the
congress
saying
that
in
our
view
there
was
false
testimony?
can
he
possibly
conclude
within
the
short
period
of
time
that
he's
left
for
the
investigation
that
there
is
not
reasonable
grounds
to
investigate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
assert
that
letter
from
the
congress
was
inappropriate,
congress
can
have
that
participation
in
the
process--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
if
that
letter
reaches
the
attorney
general
on
the
80th
day
after
his
investigation
of
whether
there
are
reasonable
grounds
to
further
investigate
continues,
and
he
has
ten
days
to
check
that
out--
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me,
ms.
morrison.
what
policies
and
guidelines
exist
that
you
are
bound
by?
what
policies
and
guidelines
does
the
department
have
governing
special
prosecutors...
or
prosecutors
in
general--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it
is
your
position
that
so
long
as
the
department
of
justice
put
something
in
the
manual
or
establishes
it
in
writing...
or
i
suppose
even
any
unwritten
policy
would
govern
you,
and
you
consider
yourself
bound
by
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
would
not
include,
i
suppose,
or
would
it,
guidelines...
as
i
recall
there
used
to
be
in
the
days
when
i
was
in
justice
department...
about
before
an
investigation
of
certain
officials
is
conducted,
matters
that
could
be
especially
sensitive,
the
matter
would
be
checked
with
the
deputy
attorney
general
or
with
the
attorney
general
before
it
goes
forward.
would
a
policy
like
that
govern
the
special
counsel--
justice
antonin
scalia
those
functions
were
not
exclusively
executive,
were
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let
me
ask
about
your
position
on
the
appointments
clause
as
far
as
the
ability
of
judges
to
appoint
officers.
you
wouldn't
contend,
i
suppose,
that
judges
can
appoint
officers
in
the
military,
or
would
you?
could
congress
vest
that
in
the
judiciary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
would
it
create
more
problems?
i
mean,
the
other
side
argues
that
that
would
create
less
problems
because
it
seems
much
worse
to
have
the
courts
appointing
the
people
who
are
going
to
present
cases
to
them,
which
they
are
supposed
to
judge
impartially,
than
it
would
be
for
judges
to
appoint
officers
who
are
going
to
go
off
to
fight
a
war
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
with--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
davidson,
can
i
ask
you
about
the
matter
in
gross
rather
than
in
the
details?
and
it
seems
to
me,
i
am
concerned
about
the
reality
of
affecting
the
balance
between
the
two
branches.
anyone
who
has
been
in
a
high
level
in
the
executive
branch
has
occasion
to
testify
before
congress.
that
is
not
always
a
happy
occasion.
the
system
has
certain
conflicts
built
in
it,
and
that
is
all
very
good;
it's
the
way
it
works.
but
isn't
the
result
of
this
that
whenever
there
is
testimony
displeasing
to
a
committee
of
congress,
and
the
committee
believes
that
the
testimony
was
not
forthright,
was
not
fully
disclosing
and
so
forth,
which
happens
not
infrequently,
that
committee
writes
a
letter
to
the
attorney
general,
and
the
consequence
is
unless
the
attorney
general
can
determine
within
90
days
that
there
is
no
basis
for
even
investigating
further,
the
individual
is
subjected
to
a
special
prosecutor
investigation
by
someone
not
appointed
by
the
attorney
general,
not
appointed
by
the
president,
by
a
staff
that
didn't
sign
on
simply
to
investigate
but
that
signed
on
to
investigate
him.
that
does
not
really
shift
the
balance
of
power
between
the
legislature
and
executive
officials
to
any
significant
degree?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
is
a
provision
that
says
that
the
counsel
has
to
obey
the
written
guidelines
and
unwritten
policies
of
the
department,
and
the
special
counsel
has
acknowledged
that
that
provision
means
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
written
that
way.
do
you
want
to
read
the
legislative
history
or
do
you
want
to
read
the
text?
it
says,
shall
be
bound
by.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
martin,
i
doubt
whether
we
are
going
to
use
the
legislative
history
to
cause
language
which
on
its
face
can
be
interpreted
in
a
constitutional
fashion
to
be
interpreted
in
an
unconstitutional
fashion.
i
mean,
the
chances
that
we
would
do
that
are
rather
slim,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
try
us,
if
the
difference
is
between
constitutionality
and
unconstitutionality.
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
this
court
said,
gee,
on
its
face
this
statute
could
be
constitutional,
but
the
legislative
history
requires
us
to
interpret
it
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
is
unconstitutional?
can
you
give
me
one
case
where
we
have
done
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
just
one
since
you're
not
going
to
use
the
rest
of
your
time
anyway.
what
do
you
interpret
the
meaning
of
the
words,
if
possible,
to
be
in
that
provision
that
says
you
must
follow
the
attorney
general's
written
guidelines
and
policies,
if
possible.
when
would
it
not
be
possible?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
