justice
marshall
i
am
one
of
the
eight
who
filed
the
descent
in
this
case
and
i
suppose
when
one
descents
from
as
many
of
the
court's
decision
in
one
day
as
i
have
today,
you
get
to
discuss
it.
i
discuss
it
because
i
think
it's
one
of
the
most
important
opinions
the
court
has
issued
in
many
years.
to
many
people,
it
may
seem
that
this
case
is
of
some
political
interest
but
it's
not
likely
now
or
in
the
future
to
have
any
proximate
effect
upon
their
lives
or
the
lives
of
their
children.
it
does
not,
after
all,
involve
freedom
of
speech,
freedom
of
the
press,
freedom
of
religion,
or
any
of
the
wonderful
guarantees
of
our
bill
of
rights.
that
is
wrong.
in
the
dictatorships
of
the
modern
world,
bill
of
rights
are
a
dime
of
dozen.
what
makes
ours
work
is
a
governmental
structure,
a
constitution
of
government
designed
by
55
extraordinarily
wise
national
leaders
over
the
course
of
a
four-month
convention
200
years
ago
last
summer.
that
structure
was
designed
to
prevent
an
excessive
governmental
power
which
is
always
the
first
threat
to
liberty
from
coalescing.
to
achieve
that,
two
principles
were
absolutely
central.
one
was
the
separation
of
powers
among
three
branches.
second
was
an
equilibration
of
powers
so
that
none
of
the
three
branches
could
become
too
strong.
for
a
lot
of
reason
the
legislative
branch,
naturally
the
most
powerful
because
it
is
the
closest
to
the
people,
was
intentionally
weakened
by
dividing
it
into
two
separate
houses
different
elected
that
would
not
always
agree.
and
for
the
same
reason,
the
executive
branch
was
strengthened
by
giving
it
a
role
in
the
legislative
process,
the
veto
power
so
that
it
could
defend
itself.
and
also,
for
the
same
reason,
the
executive's
power,
unlike
that
of
the
congress,
was
not
divided
although
that
had
been
proposed
at
the
constitutional
convention.
article
ii
section
1
provides
that
the
executive
power
shall
be
vested
in
a
president
of
the
united
states.
the
court's
opinion
today
does
not
deny
that
what
it
is
the
issue
in
this
case
is
purely
executive
power,
quintessentially
executive
power,
the
power
to
prosecute
for
violations
of
the
law.
yet,
it
holds
that
despite
the
constitution,
a
statute
can
enable
this
power
to
be
exercised
by
someone
who
is
not
entirely
subject
to
the
control
of
the
president,
a
mini
executive
so
to
speak
with
jurisdiction
over
a
very
small,
although
in
my
view,
a
very
important
area.
that
independent
counsel
has
authority
to
investigate
and
prosecute
whether
the
president
thinks
it
is
justified
or
not,
the
closes
advisers
to
the
president
and
indeed
the
president
himself.
we
allow
this
many
executive
to
be
created
because
in
our
view
and
i
quote
the
court,
“the
president's
need
to
control
the
exercise
of
the
independent
counsel's
discretion
is
not
so
central
to
the
functioning
of
the
executive
branch”
as
to
require
a
complete
presidential
control.
to
begin
with,
i
disagree
with
that
judgment.
i
suspect
that
if
a
president
were
asked
to
list
the
10
powers
he
thought
most
necessary
to
protect
himself
practically
and
politically
within
our
governmental
system,
the
ability
to
decide
whether
he
or
his
closest
advisers
should
be
criminally
prosecuted
would
surely
be
among
them.
placing
this
power
in
someone
else
has
first
of
all
an
intimidating
effect
upon
his
advisers.
the
present
--
the
present
investigation
for
example
arose
out
of
a
bitter
dispute
between
the
executive
and
congress
concerning
the
scope
of
executive
privilege.
respondent
olson
played
a
key
role
in
that
dispute
after
which
the
committee
of
congress
conducted
a
two
and
one-half
year
investigation
of
his
activities
including
testimony
before
congress
and
then
sent
a
3000-page
report
to
the
attorney
general
requesting
the
appointment
of
an
independent
counsel.
for
reasons
i
described
more
fully
in
my
opinion,
the
attorney
general
probably
had
no
choice
but
to
comply
with
that
request.
i
do
not
know
of
course
whether
mr.
olson
is
innocent
or
guilty
of
the
matters
that
are
under
investigation,
but
i
do
know
that
those
advising
the
president
and
representing
his
interest
in
testimony
before
congress
in
the
future
will
whether
they
are
innocent
or
guilty
certainly
act
with
a
reduced
degree
of
zeal.
taking
away
the
prosectorial
discretion
hurts
the
president,
secondly,
in
a
political
manner
by
eroding
his
support
among
the
people.
nothing
is
so
effective
for
that
purpose
as
being
able
to
say
that
x
number
of
the
president's
close
associates
are
under
investigation
or
indictment.
in
the
last
two
administrations,
nine
highly
publicized
independent
council
investigations
have
reduced
the
political
strength
of
the
presidency
vis-à-vis
the
congress
in
this
fashion.
but
more
fundamentally,
it
does
not
seem
relevant
to
me
as
it
does
to
the
court
how
important
the
particular
element
of
executive
power
taken
away
from
the
president
may
be.
even
if
we
were
good
at
assessing
that,
which
today's
opinion
convinces
me
we
are
not,
the
constitution
did
not
leave
the
president's
powers
at
our
mercy.
it
says
that,
“the”
executive
power
not
“some”
executive
power
shall
be
vested
in
a
president
of
the
united
states
not
a
president
of
the
united
state
and
others.
how
incompatible
what
we
have
done
today
is
with
what
has
until
today
been
our
political
traditions
maybe
made
clear
by
thinking
what
the
result
would
have
been
if
a
statute
had
been
passed
seeking
to
do
the
same
thing
to
one
of
the
other
two
branches.
would
we
have
allowed
congress
to
pass
a
statute
saying
that
henceforth
one
tiny
bit
of
the
power
to
enact
laws,
laws
relating
to
bubble
gum
for
example,
would
henceforth
be
exercised
instead
of
by
the
house
in
the
senate
by
some
new
body
established
by
statute.
or
would
we
have
allowed
congress
to
take
a
tiny
bit
of
the
judicial
power,
the
power
to
hear
bankruptcy
cases
for
example
and
give
it
to
tribunals
other
than
article
iii
courts,
the
answers
are
obvious.
a
little
over
half
a
century
ago,
when
a
case
called
“humphrey's
executor
verus
united
states”,
justice
sutherland
wrote
an
opinion
announced
the
same
day
as
the
case
that
invalidated
the
national
industrial
recovery
act,
which
prevented
president
franklin
roosevelt
from
removing
the
commissioners
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
that
was
itself
a
reversal
of
our
prior
law
regarding
the
president's
powers,
many
including
president
roosevelt
fought
it
an
action
motivated
by
hostility
to
the
president's
programs.
but
humphrey's
executor
preserved
at
least
in
theory
the
line
that
the
constitution
established.
it
allowed
the
restriction
upon
the
president's
power
because
it
found
that
the
federal
trade
commission
did
not
exercise
purely
executive
power.
today
however,
the
court
conceives
that
what
we
have
before
us
is
precisely
that.
it
affectively
overrule
humphrey's
executor
and
says
that
in
the
future
how
much
power
can
be
taken
from
the
president
will
depend
upon
quite
literally
our
case
by
case
evaluation
of
whether
what
has
been
taken
from
the
president
is
too
much.
i
do
not
think
we
are
qualified
to
decide
that.
more
importantly,
i
do
not
think
we
are
authorized
to
decide
that.
all
of
these
are
familiar
with
and
proud
of
the
phrase
that
we
think
epitomizes
our
political
system,
a
government
of
law
not
of
men.
not
many
know
where
that
came
from
which
is
part
of
the
first
article
30
of
the
massachusetts
constitution
of
1780
which
reads
in
full
as
follows.
in
the
government
of
this
commonwealth,
the
legislative
department
shall
never
exercise
the
executive
and
judicial
powers,
or
either
of
them.
the
executive
shall
never
exercise
the
legislative
and
judicial
powers
or
either
of
them.
the
judicial
shall
never
exercise
the
legislative
and
executive
powers
or
either
of
them.
to
the
end
it,
may
be
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men.
that
is
how
central
the
founders
of
our
republic
thought
the
separation
of
powers
was
to
our
system.
that
is
what
achieves
the
end
that
it
is
a
government
of
laws
not
of
men.
and
as
the
founders
knew
separation
cannot
be
preserved
without
equilibration.
today's
decision
which
departs
from
the
text
of
the
constitution
and
gives
no
reason
for
the
departure
except
that
the
majority
of
this
court
does
not
think
that
the
power
taken
away
from
the
president
was
too
much,
is
not
in
my
view
the
operation
of
the
government
of
laws
that
the
constitution
intended.
indeed,
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
the
operation
of
the
government
of
laws
at
all.
