justice
byron
r.
white
--does
the
special
division
determine
when
the
job
is
over--
justice
byron
r.
white
--how
would
they
know
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--as
a
matter
of
fact
do
independent
counsel
regularly
or
at
any
time
consult
with
the
special
division
or
members
of
the
special
division
with
respect
to
problems
that
may
arise--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
that
subject
to
review--
justice
byron
r.
white
--where--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
to
the
extent
the
court
of
appeals
had
a
different
view,
you
think
it
was
just
wrong
that
the
independent
counsel
must
follow
department
procedures--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
what
happened
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
or
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
an
expansion
was
requested,
was
the
request
made
to
the
attorney
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
independent
counsel,
do
you
think
he
or
she
is
part
of
the
executive
branch?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
independent
counsel
is
part
of
the
executive
branch
in
the
sense
that
at
least
he
or
she
is
performing
an
executive
function.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
fact
that
he
or
she
is
not
subject
to
the
usual
control
of
the
president
doesn't
necessarily
make
it
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
congress
may
never
create
an
office
in
the
executive
branch
that
is
not
subject
to
unlimited
power
by
the
president?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
power
is
being
exercised
by
the
executive,
by
an
officer
of
the
executive
branch.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
would
be,
good
cause
would
not
include
refusing
to
obey
the
order
of
the
president.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
statute,
i
suppose.
