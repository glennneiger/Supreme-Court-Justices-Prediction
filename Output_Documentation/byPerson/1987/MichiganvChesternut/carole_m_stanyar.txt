ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
concerns
the
parameters
of
fourth
amendment
protection
where
an
individual's
invocation
of
the
right
to
go
on
his
way
is
met
by
a
police
chase
by
four
officers
in
a
marked
police
cruiser.
my
argument
will
be
divided
into
three
parts.
first
of
all,
we
contend
that
this
chase
would
have
led
a
reasonable
person
to
believe
that
he
was
not
free
to
leave.
that
is
the
seizure
question.
secondly,
that
this
intrusion
was
not
justified
by
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity.
and
thirdly,
this
was
an
unreasonable
seizure
in
terms
of
its
method
and
scope.
briefly
as
to
the
facts
relevant
to
the
show
of
authority
seizure
question,
these
officers
were
driving
in
a
black
marked
detroit
police
cruiser.
it
had
markings
on
the
side
door.
according
to
the
officer,
"everybody
knows
what
it
is".
counsel
has
suggested
that
all
four
officers
were
in
plain
clothes.
i
believe
the
record
only
indicates
the
dress
of
the
officer
who
testified,
and
he
was
in
plain
clothes.
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
the
officers
activated
their
lights
or
sirens,
the
officer
was
never
asked
whether
or
not
he
activated
his
sirens,
nor
was
he
asked
whether
or
not
his
vehicle
had
that
type
of
equipment.
when
mr.
chesternut
ran
from
the
corner,
these
officers
pursued
him
around
the
corner,
chased
him
down
the
street--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--well,
your
honor,
is
perused
any
different
than
following?
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
your
honor,
i
am
using
the
term
"pursue"
as
being
synonymous
with
following
and
as
distinct
from
chasing.
what
occurred
next
was
the
chase.
they
chased
him
down
the
street
and
they
overtook
him,
and
instead
of
simply
continuing
on
down
the
block,
these
officers
had
to
slow
down
the
cruiser
in
order
to
run
it
parallel
with
mr.
chesternut.
in
that
position,
mr.
chesternut
was
alone.
he
was
isolated
from
assistance.
he
was
pitted
between
the
apartment
structure
and
a
police
cruiser.
in
that
spot
he
could
certainly
see
that
there
were
four
police
officers
here,
and
this
in
fact
was
a
police
cruiser.
his
next
actions
occurred
almost
simultaneously
he
dropped
the
packets,
and
within
five
feet,
one
running
stride,
he
stopped.
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
the
officers
all
got
out
or
all
stayed
in
the
car,
the
record
only
reflects
what
officer
peltier
did,
and
after
the
dropping
of
the
packets
and
stopping,
officer
peltier
then
got
out
and
opened
up
the
packets.
we
submit
that
under
these
circumstances
a
reasonable
person
would
feel
that
he
was
not
free
to
leave,
and
that
the
objective
characteristics
of
this
police
case
meet
the
standards
that
this
court
has
set
forth
to
define
a
seizure
by
show
of
authority.
this
police
chase
was
a
seizure
because
at
the
very
least
it
indicated
to
mr.
chesternut
that
these
officers
were
going
to
detain
him
immediately.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
at
the
very
latest,
your
honor,
respondent
contends
that
this
became
a
seizure
after
these
officers
had
chased
him
and
overtaken
him
and
were
running
the
cruiser
parallel
with
him,
because
at
that
point
you
have
conveyance,
or
the
officers
convey
a
message
to
mr.
chesternut
that,
number
one,
they
are
going
to
stop
him
immediately,
that
he
has
done
something
wrong
to
warrant
being
stopped.
we
contend
that
this
police
chase
was
a
seizure
because
it
implicated
every
basic
interest
under
the
fourth
amendment,
his
right
to
be
secure
in
his
person,
his
right
to
privacy,
his
right
to
be
left
alone
by
government,
and
his
right
to
go
on
his
way.
this
court
decided
in
united
states--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--no.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
there
is
no
record
reference
to
it
either
way.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
your
honor,
once
they
caught
him,
they
slowed
down.
it
is
our
position
that
in
order
to...
what
happened
was,
they
had
to
gain
ground
on
him
by
accelerating,
and
in
order
not
to
continue
on
past
him
they
had
to
slow
down.
that
was
my
only
point.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
the
record
doesn't
indicate
how
long
they
would
have
been
cruising
next
to
him,
but
the
officer
indicated...
the
term
he
used
was,
they
were
"running
parallel
with
him".
it
doesn't
indicate
how
long.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
the
record
doesn't
indicate
either
way.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
correct.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
i
don't
know
necessarily,
justice
o'connor,
that
that
would
be
a
seizure.
it
strikes
me--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--it
strikes
me
as
being
less
intimidating
because
you
have
two
vehicles
that
are
already
traveling
along
the
highway.
you
have
the
person
in
the
vehicle
being
at
least
a
little
more
protected
than
a
person
who
is
running
on
foot.
and
it
seems
as
though
you
just
have
a
person,
you
just
have
the--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--in
order
for
your
example
to
be
a
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment,
your
feelings
of
being
intimated
must
be
reasonable,
objectively.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
i
don't
think
it
is
as
intimidating
as
a
chase
by
a
police
cruiser
after
a
pedestrian.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
in
terms
of
your
use
of
the
phrase
keeps
up
with
you,
i
think
that
is
different
than
what
we
have
here,
because
we
have
an
individual
who
is
unequivocally
running
away
from
a
police
officer.
that
is
what
the
lower
courts
held.
and
these
officers
chase
after
him.
there
is
an
admission
in
the
lower
court
record
that
this
was
a
chase.
the
officer
was
asked
by
defense
counsel,
did
you
pursue
the
defendant
on
foot,
and
in
the
course
of
his
answer
he
corrects
her
by
saying,
no,
officer
keller
"chased
him
with
the
car".
he
is
later
asked
by
the
judge,
is
that
what
you
said,
you
chased
him
with
the
car?
his
answer,
right.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
how
did
he
know
he
was
being
chased?
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
according
to
the
record,
mr.
chesternut
had
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
police
cruiser
before
beginning
to
run.
he
then
goes
down
the
side
street,
and
i
think
the
critical
fact
here
is
that
the
police
cruiser
accelerated
to
catch
up
with
him,
and
then
it
was
running
parallel
with
him,
so
i
think
it
is
clear
that--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--well,
your
honor,
he
was
the
only
one
on
the
side
street
that
day.
he
was
alone,
and
the
officer
said--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--well,
the
record
reflects--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--the
officer
or
mr.
chsternut--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--okay.
i
think--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--they
do,
your
honor.
i
think
the
way
this
chase
evolved
here--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--my
client?
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
whether
or
not
he
believes...
whether
or
not
his
subjective
feelings
make
him
believe
he
is
nervous
or
whatever,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
critical
factor
here
is
the
objective
circumstances
as
viewed
by
the
individual,
and
the
objective
circumstances
here
are
that
mr.
chesternut
ran
and
these
officers
chased
after
him,
overtook
him,
and
then
proceeded
to
run
parallel
with
him,
and
i
think
that
conveys
to
him
that,
number
one,
that
this
is
the
man
that
we
are
after.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
if
i
had
run
from
them.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
okay,
if
i
were
walking
down
the
street
and
a
cruiser
came--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--no,
i
don't
think
i
would
be--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--no,
i
wouldn't.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
i
think
those
would
present
a
different
fact
situation.
this
court
decided--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--no,
your
honor.
our
position
in
this
case--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--all
right.
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
if
the
officer's
true
purpose
was
to
see
where
mr.
chesternut
was
going
or
to
see
where
the
individual
in
your
example
was
going,
if
that
is
their
true
purpose
here,
they
can
do
that--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--i
think
that
if
all
the
officers
were
going
to
do
in
your
example
was
to
cruise
along
and
see
what
is
up
by
seeing
where
he
was
going,
they
could
have
done
that
in
a
number
of
less
intrusive
ways.
i
think
they
could
have,
in
our
case
here,
they
could
have
simply
continued
along
and
watched
the
man.
they
could
have
followed
a
little
bit
behind.
they
could
have
gone
past
him
and
stopped.
remember
that
they
had
a
police
cruiser,
and
they
had
four
officers
here,
and
i
think
that
gives
them
a
number
of
options
in
this
case.
they
could
have
dropped
officers
off
and
circled
the
block.
i
think
they
could
have
done
a
number
of
things
to
continue
surveillance
to
follow,
to
continue
to
observe
mr.
chesternut.
i
think
what
they
should
not
be
doing,
it
would
be
our
position
where
the
line
should
be
drawn
is,
they
should
not
be
acting
in
a
manner
which
intimidates
the
individual
and
which
leads
him
to
believe
that
he
is
going
to
be
detained
imminently,
and
that
is
our
position,
that
what
occurred
here
was
not
an
attempted
seizure,
it
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
seizure,
because
clearly
if
these
officers
had
jumped
from
the
cruiser,
and
had
searched
mr.
chesternut
in
order
to
find
these
packets,
there
would
be
no
question.
how
is
it
any
less
offensive
to
the
fourth
amendment
for
them
to
force
him
to
do
himself
what
they
are
expressly
prohibited
from
doing?
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
that
strikes
me
as
somewhat
less
intimidating
than
the
case
that
we
have
here
because
you
have
some
sort
of
reassurance
to
the
individual,
but
i
still
believe
that
you
have
the
same
problem
in
terms
of
the
individual
is
exercising
his
right
to
go
on
his
way,
and
these
officers
are
not
allowing
him
to
do
that.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
be,
and
secondly,
your
honor--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
chase
which
occurred
in
this
case,
the
way
the
aggressive
and
confrontational
action
the
police
officers
took
in
this
case
belie
any
reasonable
inference
that
their
only
purpose
was
to
question
mr.
chesternut.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
correct,
and
i
think
that--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
correct
standard
is
to
take
the
objective
circumstances
as
they
appear
to
a
reasonable
individual,
and
i
think
that
the
way
this
occurred,
we
have
a
four
on
one
situation.
we
have
a
police
cruiser
chasing
after
a
pedestrian.
these
officers
have
overtaken
him
and
have
slowed
down
for
the
purpose
of
confronting
him.
these
officers...
it
is
clear
that...
well,
mr.
chesternut
would
know
that
he
was
not
armed.
if
i
can
just
briefly
go
for
a
moment
and--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--our
position
is
that
what
occurred
here
was
more
than
their
mere
presence
on
the
street.
their
approach
to
the
intersection
would
have
been
comparable--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--right.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
as
a
factual
matter,
your
honor,
i
think
those
two
questions
merge
for
the
individual,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
officers
are
going
to
stop
him
and
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
search
him,
because
a
detention
is
really
a
euphemism
for
what
the
individual
really
thinks
is
going
to
happen
to
him
out
there.
i
think
that--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--what
this
court,
i
believe,
has
said
is
that
the
objective
standard
of
what
a
reasonable
person
would
believe
that
is
going
to
happen.
my
point
in
terms
of
the
two
issues
coming
together
is
that
if
an
individual
has
been
chased
by
four
officers
in
a
police
car,
i
think
it
would
be
reasonable
for
him
to
assume
that
when
they
catch
him,
they
are
going
to
see
what
he
has
on
his
person.
they
have
a
reason
for
catching
him.
and
so
detention
in
this
situation
i
think
in
terms
of...
in
real
terms
means
that
these
officers
are
going
to
put
him
up
against
the
car
when
they
do
catch
him
and
are
going
to
search
him.
in
terms
of
the
legal
analysis
here--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--all
right.
in
terms
of
the
legal
analysis
on
the
abandonment
question,
our
primary
position
is
that
because
this
was
an
aggressive
and
confrontational
admitted
police
chase
it
violated
the
fourth
amendment,
and
that
unless
there
is
some
evidence
to
indicate
that
mr.
chesternut's
discarding
of
the
packets
was
an
act
of
free
will,
under
brown
versus
illinois,
under
wong
sun
versus
united
states,
unless
there
are
some
intervening
circumstances,
some
time
delay
which
would
suggest
that
his
abandonment
was
an
act
of
free
will,
there
is
still
an
involuntary
abandonment.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
i
don't
know...
that
you
have,
your
honor.
the
michigan
courts
have
understood
that
analysis
to
apply.
if
i
could
just
briefly...
this
court
decided
in
united
states
versus
mendenhall
and
florida
versus
royer
that
mere
questioning
was
not
constitutionally
intrusive
because
the
individual
retained
two
choices.
he
could
either
remain
and
cooperate
with
the
police
officer,
or
he
could
go
on
his
way,
and
it
is
that
choice
that
separates
a
first
tier
questioning
encounter
from
a
second
tier
terry
type
seizure.
it
is
that
choice
which
is
the
sole
reason
for
excusing
a
police
officer
from
a
requirement
of
reasonable
suspicion.
in
this
case,
the
court
has
asked
for
the
for
the
first
time
to
enforce
the
right
it
defined
in
mendenhall
and
to
reaffirm
that
the
individual
still
has
two
viable
choices.
michael
chesternut
asserted
his
right
to
choose,
and
he
chose
to
go
on
his
way,
and
unless
this
court
protects
his
right
to
make
that
choice,
the
central
premise
which
justified
the
first
tier
questioning
encounter
in
the
first
place
would
be
destroyed.
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
to
exclude
all
but
a
literal
detention
from
the
parameters
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
by
literal
detention
they
define
either
a
forceable
physical
restraint
or
in
essence
a
surrender
to
a
show
of
authority.
that
approach
would
exclude
a
huge
category
of
police-citizen
confrontations
from
this
court's
scrutiny,
and
that
approach
presumes
that
this
court's
scrutiny
is
not
necessary
because
police
officers
will
not
overreach
and
will
not
abuse
their
discretion
when
they
confront
individuals
on
the
street,
and
in
fact
petitioner
considers
that
possibility
as,
and
i
quote,
"beyond
serious
consideration".
for
20
years
since
terry
versus
ohio
this
court
has
disagreed.
since
terry,
this
court
has
recognized
that
while
a
police
officer
needs
a
flexible
response
on
the
street,
there
must
be
some
limits
on
his
actions.
the
court
recognized
then
that
the
reality
of
what
occurs
on
the
street
between
a
police
officer
and
an
individual
requires
some
constitutional
protection.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
what
could
he
do
under
those
circumstances?
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
i
think
he
could
continue
to
investigate,

he
could
continue
to
investigate
in
a
variety
of--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--he
could
follow
the
man.
he
could
watch
him.
he
could
watch
to
see
where
he
is
going.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
the
officer
admitted
in
this
case,
and
i
think
it
is
critical
that
the
officer
describes
this
as
a
chase,
and
i
think...
i
am
asking
the
court
to
credit
that
characterization
because
it
probably--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--well,
i
think
that--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--that's
correct,
we
don't
claim
that
mr.
chesternut's
running
in
the
first
instance
was
preceded
by
any
police
illegality.
what
we
claim
here
is
that
when
these
officers
chose
an
escalated
response--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--yes.
and
i
think
that
is
a
legitimate
purpose,
your
honor.
what
happened
in
this--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--what
happened
in
this
case
was,
i
think
that
they
may
have
had
a
legitimate
purpose
in
terms
of
to
see
where
he
was
going,
but
when
they
chose
to
chase
him,
aggressively
confronting
him
to
find
out--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--i
think
the
act
of
following...
the
act
of
seeing
where
he
is
going
is
inherently
different
than
the
act
of
chasing.
following
is
investigation
by
observation.
it
precedes
direct
action.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
no,
i
don't
believe
that
was
their
purpose.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
if
your
honor
were...
if
the
court
were
to
take
that
position
the
court
would
then
have
to
say
that
chasing...
excuse
me,
that
flight
in
and
of
itself,
standing
alone,
constitutes--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--constitutes
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity.
i
believe
that
this
court
has
said
at
least
implicitly
on
two
occasions
that
flight
simply
is
not
enough.
the
court
suggested
in
united
states
versus
sharpe
where
the
court
looked
at
number
of
factors
in
that
case
which
came
together
to
justify
the
stop
of
a
marijuana
truck.
flight
was
among
those
factors,
and
this
court
said
in
a
footnote,
"perhaps
none
of
these
factors
standing
alone
would
give
rise
to
reasonable
suspicion.
"
and
earlier
in
wong
sun
versus
united
states
this
court
acknowledged
that
flight
just
as
a
general
proposition
is
not
a
reliable
indicator
of
criminal
activity.
people
run
from
police
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
and
virtually
every
court
that
has
addressed
this
issue
below
has
found
that
people
run
from
police
for
a
variety
of
reasons
they
may
be
past
victims
of
brutality
or
harassment.
they
may
have
been
stopped
and
searched
in
the
past
for
no
reason.
they
may
not
want
to
be
arrested
as
a
guilty
party
falsely.
they
may
not
want
to
be
a
witness
in
a
case.
they
may
not
like
police
officers.
they
may
feel,
for
whatever
reason,
that
they
simply
cannot
hold
their
own--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--the
latter,
your
honor.
if
flight
is
deemed
to
constitute
reasonable
suspicion,
then
every
police
chase
would
be
deemed
a
reasonable
seizure,
because
every
police
chase
involves
someone
running
away.
furthermore,
a
rule
allowing
a
second
tier
seizure,
a
terry
type
seizure
on
flight
alone
in
effect
punishes
the
individual
for
exercising
his
right
to
go
on
his
way.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
i
agree,
your
honor.
my
point
is
that
if
flight,
let's
call
it
flight
from
a
police
officer,
flight
from
an
identifiable
police
officer.
still
you
have
a
situation
where
if
that
constitutes
reasonable
suspicion,
then
every
chase
is
a
reasonable
seizure
in
terms
of
no
other
suspicion
is
necessary,
no
other
sort
of
suspicious
gestures,
furtive
actions,
nothing
else
would
be
required,
and
i
think
that
that
at
least
would
be
a
retreat
from
this
court's
suggestion
in
those
cases
that
flight
is
not
enough.
in
terms
of
the
other
point,
i
believe
that
that
holding
would
in
effect
punish
the
individual
for
exercising
the
right
that
this
court
defined
in
mendenhall.
the
individual
has
two
choices.
he
can
remain
and
cooperate
with
the
police
officer,
or
he
can
go
on
his
way.
in
this
case
we
had
an
emphatic
expression
of
the
individuals'
right
to
go
on
his
way.
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
also
requires
a
balancing
of
societal
interests,
and
in
this
context
the
government
must
show
what
legitimate
law
enforcement
interest
is
served
by
allowing
a
police
officer
to
chase
after
an
individual
in
this
way
and
under
these
circumstances.
in
the
decisions
of
martinez,
fuerte,
ins
versus
delgado,
florida
versus
royer,
this
court
has
called
upon
government
in
the
first
instance
to
articulate
the
specifics
of
the
crime
problem
that
is
being
addressed.
secondly,
it
has
required
that
the
means
used
to
achieve
a
crime
solution
be
carefully
tailored
to
the
underlying
justification.
and
thirdly,
it
is
required
that
the
investigative
methods
employed
should
be
the
least
intrusive
means
reasonably
available
to
accomplish
that
end.
we
submit
simply
that
the
chase
which
occurred
in
this
case
failed
under
this
analysis.
in
terms
of
the
precise
objective
that
was
offered
here
by
this
officer,
the
officer
explained
that
he
saw
mr.
chesternut
run,
and
he
wanted
to
see
where
he
was
going,
but
instead
of
simply
following
him,
instead
of
simply
observing
him,
which
would
have
accomplished
his
objective,
these
officers
chased
after
him
with
a
police
cruiser.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
your
honor,
in
my
reading...
no,
i
haven't
abandoned
it.
it
is
just
that
it
is
my
reading
of
the
opinions
below
that
although
the
courts
decided
all
on
state
cases,
the
origin
of
the
doctrine
in
michigan
came
from
terry
versus
ohio,
so--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--no,
i
don't
abandon
it.
defense
counsel
below--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--i
don't
abandon
it,
your
honor.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
your
honor--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--well--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--i
understood
the
lower
court's
decision
as
resting
totally
on
an
interpretation
of
the
federal
constitution.
david
crump,
who
pursued
the
case
below,
did
raise
a
state
constitutional
ground
but
the
decision
was
decided
purely
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
by
defining
a
seizure
exclusively
as
a
detention,
petitioner
is
offering
the
court
another
litmus
paper
test
that
bears
no
reasonable
relation
to
the
issue
to
be
decided
or
to
the
realities
of
the
situation.
what
we
should
be
looking
at
here
is
whether
this
chase
was
an
intimidating
and
unreasonable
show
of
authority,
because
if
it
was,
then
it
offended
the
basic
principle
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
we
ought
to
consider
the
possible
ramifications
in
the
extreme
of
counsel's
position.
in
this
case...
excuse
me.
police
officers
could
conceivably
rush
up
or
chase
up
to
a
stationary
crowd,
and
if
an
individual
seeing
police
then
ran,
police
officers
could
then
chase
after
that
person
and
use
deadly
force,
fire
shorts
after
that
person,
and
unless
the
bullet
takes
effect
under
petitioner's
approach
there
would
be
no
fourth
amendment
intrusion.
that
is
precisely
where
petitioner's
approach
has
taken
the
sixth
circuit,
and
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
agree
that
that
is
an
outrageous
result,
and
one
that
simply
cannot
be
countenanced
under
the
court's
decisions
either
in
united
states
versus
mendenhall
or
tennessee
versus
gardner
or
the
fourth
amendment.
chases
on
less
than
a
reasonable
suspicion
are
going
to
affect
a
percentage
of
innocent
people.
the
more
prevalent
this
activity
becomes,
the
more
tension
it
generates
in
the
community.
the
police
chase
instantly
escalates,
the
police-citizen
confrontation,
and
in
terms
of
a
final
cost
to
society,
as
a
matter
of
public
safety
the
police
chase
is
dangerous.
it
poses
a
hazard
to
the
police,
to
the
individual,
and
to
innocent
bystanders
as
well,
as
i
have
indicated
in
my
brief,
as
i
have
documented
in
my
brief.
in
conclusion,
we
have
never
suggested
here
that
a
police
officer
has
to
sit
by,
has
to
shrug
his
shoulders
and
do
nothing.
we
have
asked
only
that
when
he
chooses
to
act
and
when
he
chooses
to
confront
the
individual
on
the
street,
that
he
must
stand
ready
to
explain
why,
and
that
he
must
choose
a
measured
response.
these
officers
failed
to
do
that
here.
by
chasing
michael
chesternut
they
deprived
him
in
a
very
real
way
of
his
right
to--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--i
think
it
would
have
been.
i
think
it
would
have
been
different,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
finale,
if
you
will,
of
confronting
him
and
of
running
the
cruiser
parallel--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--i
believe
that
it
would
be.
i
think
at
some
point
their
following
him
even
from
a
distance
behind
could
be
intimidating.
i
just
don't
think
under
your
example
it
seems
as
intimidating
as
their
confronting
him
and
running
parallel
with
him.
i
guess
that
is
my
answer.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
in
terms
of
his
running,
i
think
the
record
reflects
that
it
is
somewhere
abound
a
half
a
block.
in
terms
of
their
chasing
him,
they
had
to
go
down
the
first
block
and
halfway
up
the
second
block.
so
in
terms
of
time,
i
would
guess,
although
the
record
doesn't--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
at
that
point
it
had
already...
it
had
instantly
become
clear
to
him--
ms.
carole
m.
stanyar
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
was
enough
of
a
chase
to
convey
to
mr.
chesternut
that
these
officers
were
going
to
detain
him
immediately.
i
think
that
we
are
not
relying
on
a
prolonged
confrontation
in
support
of
our
seizure
argument.
what
we
are
relying
on
here
are
other
factors,
the
factor
that
this
was
an
aggressive
and
confrontational
situation,
a
four
on
one,
a
police
cruiser,
chase
of
a
pedestrian.
i
think
that
by
doing
that
these
officers
conveyed
to
him
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
allowed
to
leave.
these
officers
failed
to
explain
why
they
proceeded
in
this
case
and
they
have
failed
to
choose
a
measured
response.
by
chasing
they
deprived
michael
chesternut
in
a
very
real
way
of
his
right
to
feel
secure
and
of
his
right
to
go
on
his
way,
and
for
those
reasons
we
would
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
