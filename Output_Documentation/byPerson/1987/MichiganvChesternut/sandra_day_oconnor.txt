justice
o'connor
ms.
solak,
is
it
your
position
then
that
a
police
chase
never
implicates
the
fourth
amendment
until
the
person
being
chased
is
actually
stopped
or
seized?
justice
o'connor
you
mean
even
if
the
red
lights
were
flashing
and
the
siren
was
blazing
and
the
guns
were
drawn?
justice
o'connor
well,
ms.
solak,
what
if
the
police
had
a
chance
to
speak
to
the
person
and
say
stop,
we
want
to
talk
to
you,
and
he
then
takes
off
and
they
pursue?
justice
o'connor
can
that
be
a
seizure
under
the
fourth
amenmdent?
justice
o'connor
he
says
stop.
justice
o'connor
well,
is
a
show
of
authority
enough
to
implicate
the
fourth
amendment
then?
justice
o'connor
ms.
stanyar,
what
if
i
am
driving
my
automobile
on
the
public
highway
and
a
police
car
marked
as
such
and
containing
four
officers
gets
behind
me
and
follows
me
on
the
highway,
or
perhaps
catches
up
with
me
and
drives
alongside
me
along
the
highway,
and
i
don't
like
it.
it
makes
me
nervous.
have
i
been
seized?
justice
o'connor
how
would
it
differ
from
your
case
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
it
intimidates
me
to
have
a
police
car
following
me
and
going
alongside
me
on
the
highway.
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
that
is
not
objectively
reasonable?
justice
o'connor
but
if
i
were
jogging
along
the
parkway
and
the
police
cruiser
comes
up
along
side
and
keeps
up
with
me,
that
would
be
different?
justice
o'connor
--flight
alone
is
not
enough
for
what,
for
probable
cause
to
arrest,
or
for
a
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
to
make
a
terry
stop?
