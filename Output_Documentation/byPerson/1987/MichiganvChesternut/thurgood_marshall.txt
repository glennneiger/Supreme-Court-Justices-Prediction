you
wouldn't

would
you?
justice
marshall
and
find
the
dope.
that
doesn't
to
my
mind
make
this
any
less
of
an
abandonment
on
his
part.
he
has
voluntarily
parted
with
the
stuff.
justice
marshall
what
would
the
normal
police
officer
in
your
mind
do
if
he
drove
up

a
man

all
of
a
sudden
looked
and
saw
the
police
car,
and
took
off?

do
you

what?
justice

by
doing
what?

that
is
what
they
did
here.
justice

does
it
become
a
chase
because
of
what
the
officers
did
or
what
he
did?
justice
marshall
who
started
the
movement?
justice
marshall
well,
when
somebody
in
the
street
starts
running,
shouldn't
an
officer
be
interested
in
why
he
is
running?
justice
marshall
that's
what
happened
here.
justice
marshall
what
is
the
difference
between
seeing
where
he
is
going
and
chasing
him?
justice
marshall
ms.
stanyar,
are
you
going
to
abandon
the
point
or
do
you
just
don't
recognize
the
point
that
the
court
decided
this
on
state
grounds
and
not
federal
grounds?
justice
marshall
are
you
abandoning
it?
justice
marshall
have
you
abandoned
it
or

justice

leave
it.
justice

not
my
case.
justice

i
regret
i
brought
it
up.
