justice
kennedy
counsel,
do
you
take
the
position
that
he
knew
he
was
about
to
be
seized?
do
you
concede
that?
justice
kennedy
does
the
record
show
that
one
police
officer
was
detaining
him
while
the
other
was
inspecting
the
packets?
justice
kennedy
and
the
defendant
just
stands
there
while
all
this
is
happening?
