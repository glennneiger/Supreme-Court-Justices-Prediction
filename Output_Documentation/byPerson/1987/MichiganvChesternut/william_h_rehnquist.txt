h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
now
in
number
86-1824,
michigan
against
michael
chesternut.
ms.
solak,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
was
in
the
city
of
detroit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
solak.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
stanyar.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
stanyar,
you
use
the
word
"pursue".
is
that
any
different
than
followed--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--yes,
are
you
using
it
in
any
different
sense
than
followed?
the
reason
i
ask
is,
some
of
our
cases
the
knotts
case
and
the
caro
case,
say
that
the
police
can
follow
you
all
day
on
a
public
street
and
there
is
no
fourth
amendment
issue.
chief
justice
rehnquist
at
what
point
did
it
become
a
seizure?
chief
justice
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
ms.
stanyar,
about
one
of
your
responses
to
justice
scalia's
question.
you
say
that
the
police
were
forcing
him
to
do
what
he
did.
are
you
saying
that
the
presence
of
the
cruiser
and
its
"pursuit"
of
the
defendant
forced
him
to
dispose
of
those
packets?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay,
whatever
the
police
did,
that
that
not
only
ultimately
resulted
in
a
seizure
of
the
defendant,
but
that
just
before
that
it
forced
him
to
get
rid
of
those
packets.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
it
forced
him
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
isn't
a
totally
subjective
thing
at
all.
none
of
our
cases
that
that
detention
is
just
a
euphemism
for
what
the
individual
things
is
going
to
happen
to
him.
chief
justice
rehnquist
have
we
ever
applied
the
brown
versus
illinois
or
wong
sun
standards
to
abandonments?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
stanyar.
ms.
solak,
you
have
eleven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
the
case
is
submitted.
