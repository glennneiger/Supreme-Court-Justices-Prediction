justice
stevens
you
make
that
argument,
don't
you?
that
is
your
second
argument,
that
there
was
sufficient
and
reasonable
suspicion
to
justify
a
terry
stop.
justice
stevens
so
you
would
also
argue
they
could
have
pulled
him
over
and
stopped
him
and
frisked
him--
justice
stevens
--i
thought
a
terry
stop
gave
you
authority
to
make
a
frisk
for
weapons.
you
don't
take
that
position?
justice
stevens
but
he
would
have
been
just
subject
to
questioning.
justice
stevens
what
if
he
had
said,
i
am
sorry,
i'd
rather
not
talk
to
you?
justice
stevens
aren't
there
some
situations
in
which
you
might
be
mighty
glad
to
see
the
cruiser
come
up
alongside
you?
justice
stevens
and
you
might
be
running
at
the
time,
too.
justice
stevens
yes.
