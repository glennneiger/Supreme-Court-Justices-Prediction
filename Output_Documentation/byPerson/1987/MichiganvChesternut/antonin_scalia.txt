justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
happened
here.
he
dropped
the
packets
and
then
stopped
five
feet
away
from
them?
justice
scalia
that
is
very
strange.
is
there
any
explanation
for
why?
justice
scalia
ms.
stanyar,
can
i
ask
some
more
about
the
circumstances
before
you
get
any
further?
you
said
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
records,
that
the
lights
weren't
on
or
that
the
car
didn't
have
lights.
was
there
anything
that
they
were?
justice
scalia
we
have
to
take
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
were
no
sirens
going,
no
lights
flashing,
because
there
is
no
indication
that
there
were.
justice
scalia
you
say
the
car
had
to
slow
down.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
call
it
a
case
if
it
slows
down...
that
is
a
queer
sort
of
a
chase,
if
you
understand
what
i
mean.
justice
scalia
and
they
were
cruising
next
to
him
for
some--
justice
scalia
--and
again,
we
don't
know
that
they
said
anything
to
him,
that
they
said
stop
or--
justice
scalia
--so
we
assume
for
purposes
of
the
case
that
they
didn't.
justice
scalia
may
i
ask
a
question?
this
doesn't
go
to
whether
there
was
a
seizure,
but
to
the
other
justification
alleged
here,
that
if
there
was
it
was
a
proper
one,
and
i
don't
know
what
things
are
like
in
detroit,
but
i
know
in
my
neighborhood
if
there
is
a
police
car
patrolling
and
this
police
car
sees
someone
observe
the
car,
do
a
double-take,
and
start
running,
i
would
like
that
police
car
to
follow
that
person.
and
what
you
are
saying
here
is
that
there
have
to
be
instructions
issued
to
police
cars
that
if
you
see
somebody
who
sees
the
car,
his
eyes
bug
out,
and
he
starts
running,
don't
pursue
that
person.
that
is
essentially
the
instructions
you
want
our
police
officers
to
have.
justice
scalia
well,
why
is
this
any
different?
justice
scalia
no,
the
purpose
i
want
them
to
chase
them
is
to
ask
them,
what
are
you
running
from
us
for?
or,
you
know,
this
is
something
suspicious,
it
seems
to
me.
a
fellow
sees
a
police
car
and
immediately
starts
running.
don't
you
think
that
sound
law
enforcement
would
say,
you
know,
you
don't
have
to
frisk
the
guy
necessarily,
but
at
least,
you
know,
cruise
along
a
little
and
see
what
is
up.
what
is
bad
about
that?
justice
scalia
well,
suppose
in
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
this
police
car
in
my
neighborhood
just
cruises
alongside
the
person
running
and
rolls
down
the
window
and
says,
is
something
the
matter,
i
saw
you,
you
know,
lighting
out,
what
is
going
on?
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
scalia
well,
we
don't
know
what
would
have
happened
here.
and
that
is
your
opponent's
point.
we
really
don't
know
what
might
have
happened
if
your
client
hadn't
dropped
the
packet
and
stopped.
had
he
continued
running,
the
police
officers,
for
all
we
know,
might
have
rolled
down
the
window
and
say,
what
seems
to
be
the
trouble,
you
know,
i
saw
you
taking
off
like
that.
that
would
be
proper
if
they
had
done
that,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
just
in
my
neighborhood
it
is
okay,
but
not
in
this
neighborhood?
justice
scalia
why?
the
only
thing
that
might
belie
that
is
his
knowledge
that
he
had
these
packets
in
his
pocket,
and
you
have
told
us
we
shouldn't
take
that
into
account.
justice
scalia
we
should
assume
that
he
is
on
the
way
to
church,
as
justice
marshall
said.
justice
scalia
ms.
solak,
i
really
don't
care
where
he
is
going.
i
want
to
know
where
he
is
coming
from.
do
you
really
think
they
are
chasing
him
to
see
where
he
is
going?
they
want
to
know
where
he
lives?
justice
scalia
they
are
chasing
him
because
they
think
he
has
done
something,
and
what
they
want
to
catch
up
with
him
for
is
to
ask
him,
what
are
you
running
from?
isn't
that
what
an
intelligent
police
officer
would
do,
at
least,
at
least
that,
if
not
do
a
terry
stop?
justice
scalia
invites
pursuit.
yes,
i
would--
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
every
police
chase
does
not
involve
somebody
running
away
in
the
sense
that
occurred
here,
that
is,
someone
who
only
starts
running
after
he
sees
the
policeman.
i
mean,
this
isn't
the
police
picking
on
somebody
and
saying
let's
chase
that
fellow
for
some
reason.
this
is
the
fellow,
the
policemen
observed
him
run
only
after
he
saw
them.
that
is
not
every
chase.
