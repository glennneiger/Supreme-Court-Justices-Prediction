where
were
they,
on
the
ground?
justice
white
you
wouldn't
say
the
same
thing
if
you
were
riding
in
a
car,
would
you,
and
a
policeman
came
up
behind
you
and
turned
on
his
red
lights
and
his
siren?
you
usually
pull
over
then.
justice
white
well,
how
about
an
official
show
of
authority
like
red
lights
and
a
siren?
justice
white
well,
this
citizen
in
this
case,
he
understood
that
the
police
were
chasing...
she
understood
the
police
were
chasing
here,
i
guess.
justice
white
she
stopped,
anyway,
didn't
she?
justice
white
is
that
a
he
or
a
she?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
there
was
a
seizure
here,
wasn't
there?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
no,
no,
no,
there
was
a
seizure
of
the
effects.
justice
white
well,
the
officer
picked
up
the
packets.
they
seized
the
packets
that
were
thrown
away.
justice
white
what
justified
that?
justice
white
what
justified
that?
justice
white
what
was
held
was
that
the
abandonment
was
the
fruit
of
an
unlawful
seizure,
i
guess.
justice
white
but
in
any
event
you
say
that
there
was
reason
enough
to...
seizure
of
the
packets
was
legal
wholly
aside
from
any
seizure
of
the
person?
justice
white
because
they
were
abandoned,
or
because
he
had
given
up
any
privacy?
justice
white
and
the
officers
could
not
only
seize
them
but
open
them?
justice
white
but
he
had
to
open
the
packets
to
see
the
pills?
justice
white
--supposed
to
stay
there,
or
he
wouldn't
have,
but
he
just
was
mistaken,
i
guess.
justice
white
you
think
just
running
away
justified
a
terry
stop,
a
forceful
terry
stop?
justice
white
that
issue
isn't
here,
right?
justice
white
xxx
if
they
hadn't
pulled
up
alongside
of
him,
if
they
had
just
stayed
25
yards
behind
him?
justice
white
if
they
had
to
stay
25
yards
behind
him
and
then
he
had
thrown
away
the
packets
and
then
stopped
just
like
he
did
here,
thinking
that
the
police
were
really
after
him,
that
would
have
been
a
different
case?
justice
white
how
much
of
a
chase
was
it?
how
far
did
he
run
before
he
stopped?
justice
white
but
he
only
ran
a
half
a
block--
justice
white
--before
he
threw
away
the
packets
and
stopped?
justice
white
not
much
of
a
chase.
