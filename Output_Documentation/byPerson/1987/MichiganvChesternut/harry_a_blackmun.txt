justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
the
second
case,
michigan
versus
chesternut,
this
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
michigan.
the
respondent,
mr.
chesternut
was
observing
the
approach
of
a
detroit
police
car
on
routine
patrol.
he
began
to
run
and
the
car
followed
him
and
drove
alongside
him
for
a
short
distance
and
the
officers
observed
chesternut
discarding
a
number
of
packets.
the
police
surmise
that
the
pills
subsequently
discovered
in
those
packets
contained
codeine
and
respondent
was
arrested
and
the
search
of
his
person
revealed
other
drugs
and
a
hypodermic
needle,
and
he
was
charged
with
violations
of
the
michigan
drug
laws.
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
the
magistrate
dismissed
the
charges
on
the
ground
that
chesternut
had
been
unlawfully
seized
during
the
police
pursuit.
and
the
trial
court
upheld
that
dismissal
and
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
affirmed
under
precedents
interpreting
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
the
court
also
concluded
that
respondent's
flight
was
insufficient
by
itself
to
give
rise
to
the
particular
suspicion
necessary
to
justify
this
kind
of
seizure.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment
and
remand
the
case.
we
hold
that
the
officer's
pursuit
did
not
constitute
a
seizure
implicating
fourth
amendment
protections.
and
thus
the
charges
were
improperly
dismissed.
we
feel
that
no
bright-line
rule
for
all
investigatory
pursuits
can
be
fashioned.
the
appropriate
test
instead
is
whether
a
reasonable
man
viewing
the
particular
police
conduct
and
within
the
setting
of
all
the
circumstances
would
have
concluded
that
the
police
in
some
way
had
restrained
his
liberty
so
that
he
was
not
free
to
leave.
and
under
this
test,
respondent
was
not
seized
before
he
discarded
the
drug
packets.
the
police
conduct
here,
that
is
a
brief
acceleration
to
catch
up
with
him
and
followed
by
a
short
drive
alongside
him,
would
not
have
communicated
to
the
reasonable
person
and
attempt
to
capture
him
or
otherwise
intrude
upon
his
freedom
of
movement.
the
police
therefore
were
not
required
to
have
a
particularized
and
objective
basis
for
suspecting
respondent
of
criminal
activity
in
order
to
pursue
him.
the
decision
is
unanimous
but
justice
kennedy
joined
by
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
