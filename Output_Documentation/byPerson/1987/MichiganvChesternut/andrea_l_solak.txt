ms.
andrea
l.
solak
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
december
19th,
1984,
at
approximately
12:30
p.m.,
four
plainclothes
officers
were
on
a
routine
patrol
in
the
city
of
detroit
in
a
standard
police
car,
black
in
color
with
markings
at
the
side
door.
at
a
preliminary
examination
one
officer
testified
that
he
observed
a
car
pull
to
the
curb
and
a
man
alite
from
the
car
and
address
the
respondent
standing
on
the
corner.
the
police
car
continued
its
westward
path,
approaching
the
corner,
at
which
time
the
respondent
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
police
car,
turned
and
began
to
run
down
the
street.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
it
was,
your
honor.
yes.
the
police
car
pulled
around
the
corner
and
drove
parallel
to
the
running
man.
there
were
no
lights,
sirens,
or
verbal
communications
directed
to
respondent.
during
this
time,
the
respondent
tossed
a
number
of
packets
from
his
right
hand
pocket,
proceeded
about
five
feet
further,
and
stopped.
the
officer
then
got
out
of
his
car
and
retrieved
the
packets
and
found
pills.
based
on
his
experience,
he
believed
them
to
contain
suspected
narcotics.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
they
had
been
tossed
to
the
sidewalk.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
yes,
he
was
observed
to
have
tossed
them
from
his
righthand
pocket.
the
officer
then
arrested
the
respondent
for
possession
of
narcotics.
the
prosecutor
at
a
motion
to
bind
over
for
trial
argued
that
there
was
nothing
illegal
in
pursuing
a
citizen
down
the
street.
the
examining
magistrate
rejoined,
"want
to
bet",
and
we
are
here
today
to
settle
that
bet.
in
1968
in
terry
v.
ohio
this
court
faced
the
question
of
whether
an
actual
physical
restraint
of
a
person
for
purposes
other
than
a
probable
cause
based
arrest
implicates
the
fourth
amendment,
and
if
so,
when,
if
ever,
is
that
seizure
reasonable.
this
court,
of
course,
concluded
that
such
seizures
do
come
within
the
fourth
amendment
and
are
reasonable
and
justified
by
articulable
facts
demonstrating
a
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
criminal
activity
is
afoot.
this
court
observed
in
terry
that
prior
to
the
point
of
the
actual
physical
restraint
it
need
only
to
have
assumed
there
was
no
intrusion
upon
constitutionally
protected
rights.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
that
is
my
position,
and
that
seizure,
of
course,
could
take
place
by
actual
physical
restraint
by
the
officer.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
that
is
correct,
even
if
there
were
perhaps
that
show
of
authority,
unless
and
until
the
capture,
if
you
will,
takes
place,
there
is
no
seizure.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
most
citizens
do
usually
acquiesce,
and
under
my
standard
if
the
citizen
did
pull
over
and
it
was
in
response
to
an
official
show
of
authority,
that
would
be
a
seizure.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
and
if
the
citizen
were
to
have
acquiesced
to
those
red
lights
and
a
siren,
i
believe
a
seizure
would
have
taken
place.
if
the
citizen
did
not
acquiesce
and
engaged
in
a
pursuit
it
would
be
our
position
that
is
not
in
fact
a
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
yes--
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
--he
did
ultimately
stop.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
it
was
a
he,
michael.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
yes,
he
did
ultimately
stop.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
he
knew...
the
court
believed
that
he
had
reason
to
anticipate
a
capture,
but
he
did
not
in
fact
stop.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
this
was
seconds
before
the
seizure.
exactly,
your
honor.
in
cases
such
as
united
states
versus--
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
--no,
i
do
not.
thank
you
for
bringing
that
point
to
the
fore.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
the
defendant's
conduct
in
abandoning
may
not
have
been
an
intelligent
decision,
but
i
would
argue
that--
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
--other
than
the
presence
of
the
police?
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
no,
he
did
not.
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
point,
we
do
not
concede
that
the
instant
case
was
in
fact
an
attempted
seizure.
rather,
what
we
would
suggest
is
that
there
was
absolutely
no
entree
or
attempted
communication
by
the
police
officer
other
than
his
mere
presence
on
the
scene
and
in
the
absence
of
a
show
of
authority
or
an
exercise
of
force
it
is
improper
and
factually
illogical
to
assume
that
the
defendant
would
in
fact
have
been
seized.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
this
court
has
recognized
that
police-citizen
encounters
of
the
sort
that
you
might
have
described
are
appropriate
on
some
occasion.
an
officer
may
make
an...
of
a
citizen.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
i
don't
believe
in
mendenhall
versus
royer
that
merely
the
entre
by
an
officer,
i
would
like
to
speak
to
you,
would
constitute
a
seizure.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
saying
stop
and
asserting
perhaps
police
presence
would
certainly
add
a
factor
into
an
assessment
of
a
show
of
authority.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
enough
to
implicate
the
fourth
amendment.
there
must
also
be
the
response
in
response
to
a
show
of
authority.
basically
the
test
that
is
proffered
before
this
court
by
the
petitioner
has
a
cause
and
effect
analysis.
if
the
police
undertake
by
a
show
of
authority
or
exercise
of
force
to
cause
the
restraint
of
the
petitioner
and
they
effect
that
restraint,
then
there
will
be
a
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment,
so
you
therefore
have
the
show
of
authority
and
either
the
actual
capture
or
the
acquiescence
which
is
reasonably
responsive
to
that
show
of
authority.
in
a
survey
of
the
cases
that
have
been
handled
by
this
court,
most
of
the
cases
involve...
in
fact
all
of
the
cases
involve
either
an
actual
physical
restraint
or
a
citizen's
acquiescence
to
a
show
of
authority.
this
court
has
never
held
nor
intimated
that
a
citizen
who
in
fact
goes
on
his
way
has
been
seized.
in
a
related
area
at
least
two
circuits,
the
sixth
and
the
ninth,
have
refused
to
find
a
fourth
amendment
violation
so
as
to
support
a
42
usc
1983
cause
of
action
in
instances
where
a
plaintiff
ran
or
drove
away
from
a
police
officer
clearly
attempting
to
achieve
a
seizure.
the
pursuit
which
ensued
in
those
cases
was
not
held
to
be
a
restraint
on
a
liberty
by
official
show
of
authority
so
as
to
constitute
a
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
in
this
case?
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
in
this
case
there
was
ultimately
a
probable
cause
seizure.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
the
people
would
not...
the
petitioner
would
not
concede
that
in
fact
there
was
a
seizure,
just
as
we
suggested--
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
--the
officer
did
pick
up
the--
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
--pardon
me?
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
there
was
an
abandonment
of
the
packet.
the
respondent
in
fact
relinquished
any
expectations
of
privacy
that
he
may
well
have
had.
just
as
we
submit
that
a
seizure
is
a
seizure
when
it
occurs,
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
finding
that
the
abandonment
was
in
anticipation
of
a
potentially
unlawful
search.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
held,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
abandonment
was
the
fruit
of
an
unlawful
seizure
of
the
person
by
virtue
of
the
pursuit.
they
did
not
differentiate
between
a
search
of
the
person
from
which
the
evidence
may
have
been
derived
and
a
seizure
of
the
citizen.
given
the
myriad
of
police-citizen
encounters
that
this
court
has
recognized,
it
is
simply
illogical
to
assume
that
an
encounter
by
the
police
and
the
citizen
will
necessarily
result
in
an
illegal
detention
or
seizure
and
further
an
illegal
search.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
yes,
it
was.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
no,
it
is
indeed
a
michigan
case.
by
way
of
information,
shabaz
had
cert
granted
by
this
court,
and
the
respondent
in
that
case
met
an
untimely
death
and
the
case
was
dismissed
as
being
moot.
the
ninth
circuit
in
holding
that
a
pursuit
is
not
a
seizure
stated
that
flight
is
an
act
of
autonomy
whose
purpose
is
to
avoid
restraint,
and
i
believe
these
two
circuits
teach
that
a
seizure
is
a
seizure
and
an
attempted
seizure
is
not
a
seizure.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
did
recently
conclude
that
a
person
is
seized
when
a
pursuit
begins.
the
court
concluded
that
the
person
pursued
assumes
that
the
object
of
the
chase
is
a
capture.
thus
when
the
chase
commences
the
stop
begins.
this
rationale
tracks
the
rationale
employed
by
the
michigan
courts.
however,
i
believe
it
runs
afoul
of
the
teachings
of
ins
versus
delgado.
in
delgado
there
was
a
factory
survey
wherein
immigration
officers
were
clearly
identifiable,
armed,
and
stationed
at
the
doors
of
the
private
factory.
this
court
stated,
though
a
person
may
have
been
questioned
if
they
had
attempted
to
leave
this
did
not
create
a
reasonable
apprehension
of
a
detention,
and
further,
that
if
the
person
may
have
been
detained
if
they
attempted
to
leave,
in
fact
in
that
case
the
people
did
not
attempt
to
leave.
the
seizure
question
was
simply
thus
not
litigable
on
that
ground
as
it
had
not
occurred.
this
court
stated
that
one
may
only
litigate
that
which
actually
occurred
to
him.
similarly
in
the
instant
case
the
fact
that
the
respondent
may
have
been
questioned
had
he
chosen
to
remain
does
not
create
a
reasonable
apprehension
of
enforceable
detention
nor
the
possibility
that
had
he
attempted
to
leave
he
would
have
been
detained
means
that
he
was
detained.
in
fact,
he
was
free
to
go
about
his
way
and
he
did
so.
he
was
not
detained
by
the
police.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
an
objective
finding
that
a
detention
was
contemplated
or
attempted.
again,
there
was
no
sirens,
verbal
commands,
or
lights
that
were
employed
by
the
police.
the
trial
court
admitted
that
he
didn't
know
what
would
have
happened,
and
the
police
officer
stated
he
simply
pursued
the
respondent
to
see
where
he
was
going.
therefore,
it
was
the
defendant...
the
respondent's
flight
from
the
mere
presence
of
the
police
officer
which
prevented
any
kind
of
encounter,
consensual
or
otherwise,
from
occurring.
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
the
police
officers
did
not
immediately
approach
the
respondent.
they
did
not
leave
their
cars
until
such
time
as
the
narcotics
were
thrown
to
the
sidewalk,
and
then
only
after
having
inspected
the
pills
and
finding
them
to
contain
narcotics
did
they
then
approach
the
respondent.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
i
do
indeed
say
that,
your
honor,
that
the
seizure
was
legal.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
he
had
given
up
any
privacy
rights
as
well,
yes.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
he
inspected
the
pills,
yes,
and
found
them
to
be
suspected
narcotics.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
he
did
open
the
packets,
yes.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
yes,
he
ran
approximately
five
feet
further
and
simply
stopped.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
there
is
no
explanation.
the
record
is
scant.
it
was
a
preliminary
examination.
the
case
never
did
go
to
trial.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
no,
in
fact,
i
believe
the
record
indicates
that
the
officer
who
testified
was
the
only
one
to
have
gotten
out
of
the
car,
inspected
the
packets,
and
then
arrested
the
defendant.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
that's
correct.
that's
the
reflection
of
the
record.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
he
was
mistaken
and
perhaps
his
conduct
in
retrospect
was
not
wise.
it
was
not,
however,
in
response
to
a
show
of
authority
by
the
police.
assuming
arguendo
that
the
pursuit
of
the
respondent
was
a
seizure
and
that
his
abandonment
was
a
search,
the
petitioner
submits
that
the
minimal
intrusion
upon
the
individual
may
be
justified
by
circumstances
which
would
lead
a
reasonable
person
to
believe
that
criminal
activity
was
afoot.
the
reaction
of
the
police
in
this
case
to
the
unprecipitated
flight
by
the
respondent
is
exactly
the
type
of
swift,
on
the
pot
reaction
that
this
court
has
anticipated
in
terry
and
which
is
necessary
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
the
cause
of
the
flight
in
this
case
was
not
wholly
ambiguous.
rather,
it
was
in
direct
response
to
the
presence
of
identifiable...
the
police.
the
alternative
of
the
police
in
this
case
which
respondent
proposes
is
that
the
police
should
simply
shrug
their
shoulders
and
allow
either
a
crime
to
occur
or
a
criminal
to
escape.
such
conduct
in
and
of
itself
would
be
a
dereliction
of
duty
and
unreasonable
by
the
police
officer.
respondent
submits
that
the
flight
from
an
identifiable
police
officer
provides
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
criminal
activity
is
afoot
and
justifies
the
minimum
intrusion
and
brief
temporary
detention.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
act
of
dropping
the
packets--
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
--under
our
position,
the
police
could
have
engaged
in
some
kind
of
consensual
encounter.
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
exactly
what
they
did
do.
they
could
well
have
engaged
in
a
consensual
encounter,
simply
asking
the
individual,
why
are
you
running,
where
are
you
going,
is
something
amiss?
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
i
do
believe
that
running
from
the
site
of
a
police
officer--
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
--no,
actually,
that
issue
is
not
factually
presented,
because
in
fact
the
respondent
ran
from
an
encounter
on
the
corner
with
another
individual,
and
that
flight
was
precipitated
then
by
the
observation
of
the
police.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
that
is
our
second
argument,
yes.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
yes,
that
is
my
argument.
i
did
not
make
the
argument
relative
to
the
frisk.
if
in
fact
that
is
developed
that
would
have
led
the
officer
to
believe
that
the
respondent
was
armed,
he
may
then
have
gone
forth
with
a
frisk,
but
certainly
he
could
have
pulled
him
over
as
to
a
brief
temporary
terry
stop.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
i
do
not
take
the
position
that
in
and
of
itself
he
would
have
been
subject
to
a
frisk.
no,
i
don't.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
at
best,
brief
questioning.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
at
that
point
in
time
it
is
fish
or
cut
bait.
the
officer
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
investigate
the
nature
of
the
suspicious
conduct,
the
flight.
if
he
had
looked
about
him
and
seen
nothing
discarded
in
the
flight
path
of
the
individual,
and
no
other
reason
to
believe
that
criminal
activity
had
gone
forth,
he
would
then
have
to
really
see
the
defendant,
the
respondent.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
no,
what
would
have
then
found
is
that
there
was
no
further
reason
for
the
definition.
the
flight
in
fact
justified
the
brief
investigative
detention,
but
prolonged
or
further
detention
at
that
point
would
no
longer
be
justified
and
he
would
have
to
release
the
individual.
in
sum,
the
petitioner
submits
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
neither
seized
nor
searched
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
cannot
litigate
the
reasonableness
of
that
which
did
not
occur.
moreover,
if
the
pursuit
and
the
abandonment
of
the
narcotics
are
viewed
as
a
seizure
and
a
search,
that
seizure
should
be
viewed
as
justified
by
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
criminal
activity
is
afoot.
thank
you.
ms.
andrea
l.
solak
i
thank
the
court.
i
have
no
further
comments.
