mr.
stein,
getting
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
you
kind
of
left
off
between
the
guard
and
the
doctor
as
to
the
difference
under
the
color
of
state
law.
what
is
the
difference
under
color
of
state
law?
justice
marshall
what
is
the
doctor
hired
to
be?
justice
marshall
but
that's
not
what
this
case
is
about.
this
case
is
about
what
he
did
as
a
prison
doctor.
that
is
different
from
a
private
doctor,
right?
justice
marshall
what's
the
difference
between
a
prison
doctor
and
a
guard?
justice
marshall
start
on
it.
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
marshall
and
not
responsible
to
the
prisoner
at
all?
justice
marshall
so
the
only
difference
is
that
a
doctor
is
a
doctor
and
a
prison
guard
is
a
prison
guard.
they
are
both
hired
by
the
state,
aren't
they?
justice
marshall
and
was
the
guard
doing
what
he
was
supposed
to
do,
and
was
the
doctor
doing
what
he
was
supposed
to
do
under
the
state
law?
justice
marshall
was
the
doctor
operating
under
color
of
state
law?
justice
marshall
was
he
operating
under
the
state
law?
justice
marshall
he's
paid
by
the
state.
justice
marshall
to
provide
medical
services.
justice
marshall
which
allegedly
he
did
wrongly.
justice
marshall
and
therefore
the
state
is
not
responsible?
justice
marshall
but
this
wasn't
under
color
of
state
law?
justice
marshall
who
else
was
he
hired
by
at
the
time
he
acted
in
this
case?
who
else
was
he
hired
by?
justice
marshall
the
complaint
is--
justice
marshall
--that
in
doing
that
he
did
wrong,
and
you
say
the
state
has
no
responsibility.
justice
marshall
was
he
a
prisoner
when
he
was
treating
him?
justice
marshall
and
he
was
under
guard
just
the
same
as
in
the
middle
of
the
jailhouse,
right?
justice
marshall
well,
it
was
a
prison
hospital.
it
wasn't
a
private
hospital.
is
that
right?
justice
marshall
so
he
was
still
under
restraint,
subject
to
the
eighth
amendment.
justice
marshall
well,
he
was
there.
we
are
not
complaining...
we
are
complaining
about
what
he
did
while
this
man
was
under
restraint
as
a
prisoner.
and
is
there
any
difference
between
the
hospital
and
the
prison
as
to
that?
justice
marshall
and
what
is
the
difference?
justice
marshall
suppose
he
had
been
in
the
prison
treating
him.
would
he
still
be
exempt?
justice
marshall
if
he
was
treating
him
inside
of
the
prison,
would
he
still
be
exempt
under
your
theory?
