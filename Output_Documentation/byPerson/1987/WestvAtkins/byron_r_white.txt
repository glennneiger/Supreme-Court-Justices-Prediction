justice
white
why
the...
this
is
a
1983
suit?
justice
white
why
that
suit
instead
of
an
ordinary
negligence
suit?
justice
white
but
there
would
have
been...
a
negligence
suit
wasn't
barred,
was
it?
justice
white
who
could
he
have
sued?
justice
white
how
about
the
prison?
anybody
in
the
prison?
justice
white
i
see.
do
you
understand
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
held
that
there
is
no
state
action
even
if
a
doctor
is
an
employee
of
the
prison?
justice
white
it
covers
any
doctor
in
or
out
of
the
prison
system.
justice
white
would
not
be
exercising
any
state
action.
justice
white
on
that
basis
there
would
never
be
a
recovery.
justice
white
against
the
person.
justice
white
under
federal
law.
justice
white
well,
but
how
about
the
people
furnishing
the
services?
that's
what
i
thought
was
being
asked
about.
mr.
safron,
couldn't
you
draw
a
line
between
whether
the
services
being
provided
are
the
services
of
administering
the
penalty,
of
administering
the
punishment,
of
taking
charge
of
the
custody
of
the
individual,
which
is
indeed
the
sentence
that
the
state
has
imposed--
justice
white
i
know,
but
you
would
say
if
he
didn't
give
him
any
service
at
all
he
couldn't
be
sued
under
1983.
say
he
gave
the
most
radical
treatment.
