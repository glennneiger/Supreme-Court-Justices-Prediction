justice
o'connor
mr.
stein,
do
you
take
the
position
that
any
physician
performing
services
and
paid
by
the
state
would
be
liable,
in
your
view,
and
would
constitute
state
action?
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
even
a
physician
serving
as
a
consultant
in
his
own
office
on
a
special
medical
problem?
just
so
long
as
he
is
paid
by
the
state,
then
it
is
state
action?
justice
o'connor
i
am
just
wondering
what
kind
of
line-drawing
we
could
have
legitimately
if
we
adopted
your
view
of
the
liability
here.
justice
o'connor
so
even
if
he
is
employed
full-time
and
exclusively
by
the
state
to
render
medical
care
to
the
prisoners,
you
take
the
position
no
liability.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
prison
hired
on
a
contract
basis
prison
guards,
all
of
whom
are
licensed
under
some
state
licensing
scheme
to
make
them
professionals?
justice
o'connor
no
liability?
not
state
actors.
justice
o'connor
that
is
a
little
difficult
to
argue
in
the
face
of
estelle,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
take
the
position,
though,
i
gather,
that
even
if
the
allegation
is
that
this
doctor,
simply
didn't
like
the
prisoner,
thought
he
was
a
bad
actor,
and
thought
he
would
get
back
at
him
by
making
him
physically
suffer
and
withdrawing
and
denying
medical
care,
that
there
can
be
no
liability
as
a
state
actor.
i
understand
that
is
your
argument,
right?
justice
o'connor
make
it
as
bad
as
you
want.
paint
the
worst
picture
possible.
it's
a
prison
doctor.
he's
a
professional.
he
is
hired
not
as
a
full-time
employee,
on
a
contract
basis.
but
that's
what
he
does.
he
wants
to
make
that
prisoner
suffer,
and
he
does.
justice
o'connor
well,
why
is
he
not
a
state
actor?
just
refresh
my
recollection.
under
those
circumstances.
justice
o'connor
you
fall
back
under
the
professional
argument
now?
it
is
just
not
clear
to
me,
your
honor.
justice
o'connor
we
are
talking
about
whether
he
is
a
state
actor
or
not.
now,
what
rationale
do
you
rely
upon
to
say
he
is
not
a
state
actor?
justice
o'connor
falling
back
on
the
professional.
justice
o'connor
all
right.
i
thought
in
response
to
justice
scalia
you
had
backed
off
that,
but
now
we're
back
to
that.
