mr.
adam
stein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
dr.
samuel
atkins,
was
the
physician
responsible
for
orthopedic
services
for
some
17,000
prisoners
in
the
north
carolina
prison
system.
the
petitioner,
quincy
west,
was
a
north
carolina
prisoner.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
north
carolina
granted
the
respondent
summary
judgment
and
a
majority
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
sitting
en
banc
affirmed,
holding
that
the
respondent
did
not
act
under
color
of
law
when
he
was
managing
the
health
services
of
the
petitioner.
petitioner's
lawsuit
brought
under
1983
in
the
federal
district
court
was,
of
course,
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
estelle
against
gamble,
where
the
court
had
held
that
the
deliberate
denial
of
serious
medical
services
constituted...
by
a
prison
authority
constituted
the
infliction
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
and
of
course,
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
prisoner
is
himself
helpless
to
have
medical
services
unless
the
state
provides
it,
and
in
north
carolina
that
is
true.
a
prisoner
such
as
petitioner
cannot
obtain
medical
services
except
for
the
services
given
to
him
by
the
state.
even
if
he
could
afford
to
hire
a
doctor,
he
is
not
allowed
to
do
so
according
to
north
carolina
law.
this
then,
the
case
that
was
brought
then
was
exactly
the
sort
of
case
that
the
court
indicated
was
actionable
under
1983
in
estelle.
there
were
allegations
that
there
was
abuse
of
power
by
an
authority
by
denying
needed
medical
services,
and
that
it
was
done
by
somebody
with
authority
granted
by
the
state
to
so
act.
mr.
adam
stein
justice
o'connor,
i
would
take
that
position,
but
that
isn't
this
case.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
adam
stein
--well,
the
argument
there
would
be
that
under
estelle
there
is
an
eighth
amendment
obligation
on
the
state
to
provide
medical
services
to
the
prisoner,
and
that
if
the
state
has
then
selected
this
physician,
that
person
is
doing
the
state's
work,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
your
honor
has
described
a
fact
situation
on
a
spectrum
of
the
least
involvement
of
the
state
presumably
up
to
the
position
of
a
medical
director
who
is
a
regular
employee.
mr.
adam
stein
well,
my
view
is
that
there
is
no
line
to
be
drawn,
that
indeed
the
provision
of
medical
services
is
a
state
responsibility,
but
that
isn't
my
case,
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
facts
in
the
record
show
that
dr.
atkins
in
this
case
was
much
more
like
the
person
who
is
in
charge
of
the
whole
medical
system,
is
a
regular
employee
and
always
has
been.
mr.
adam
stein
well,
your
honor,
in
that
circumstance,
if
the
prisoner
himself
had
the
choice
and
the
state
would
pay
for
all
of
them,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
a
very
different
case
from
what
we
have
here.
if
the
prisoner
could
choose
the
best
orthopedic
physician
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
he
chose
that
person
rather
than
the
state,
it
seems
to
me
the
state's
payment
would
not
be
so
significant.
mr.
adam
stein
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
has
assigned
to
dr.
atkins
the
responsibility
for
deciding
what,
if
any,
orthopedic
services
are
to
be
provided
to
any
of
its
prisoners.
mr.
adam
stein
well,
the
punishment
is
when
the
doctor,
instead
of
exercising
medical
judgment,
instead
takes
an
action
to
prevent
the
prisoner
from
getting
the
medical
services
that
he
needs.
mr.
adam
stein
your
honor,
i
submit
that
it
is
a
good
deal
more
than
malpractice.
the
distinction
in
estelle,
estelle
doesn't
reach
ordinary
malpractice.
if
a
doctor
is
simply
exercising
professional
judgment
and
does
it
negligently,
that
is
not
an
eighth
amendment
violation
under
estelle
and
that
is
not
the
understanding.
it
is
my
understanding
and
what
the
courts
have
held
is
that
one
must
show
an
action
beyond
medical
judgment.
indeed,
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
what
happened
was
that
dr.
atkins
in
his
last
examination
of
the
petitioner
five
months
after
he
had
first
seen
him,
saw
him
in
his
office,
said,
your
achilles
tendon
has
not
yet
healed,
you
may
need
an
operation,
but
you
certainly
need
continuing,
regular
orthopedic
care
from
me,
and
that
was
the
medical
judgment
he
entered,
and
then
immediately
upon
the
petitioner
leaving
the
office
he
wrote
on
that
day
in
the
medical
records,
i
discharged
this
man
from
further
orthopedic
services,
and
in
fact
that
order
was
obeyed,
despite
other
prison
people
trying
to
get
this
man
to
dr.
atkins.
mr.
adam
stein
well,
he
was
given
the
power
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
person
would
have
treatment,
just
as
the
guards
who
are
identified
in
lots
of
the
cases
and
were
identified
in
the
estelle
case,
seeing
a
man
needing
medical
treatment
and
saying,
i
am
not
going
to
allow
you
to
see
the
physician,
that
is
an
infliction
of
punishment
because
that's
the
only
access
to
the
medical
care
there
is.
mr.
adam
stein
justice,
i
don't
know
about
that
case
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
medical
care
which
is
one
of
the
core
functions
within
the
prison
system...
there
are
only
a
few
that
the
court
has
identified
that
must
be
satisfied
to
satisfy
the
eighth
amendment
in
maintaining
the
system.
one
is
some
minimal
degree
of
medical
care,
i
suppose
food
and
clothing
and
shelter.
and
if
those
aren't
provided
at
a
minimal
level,
then
there
is
a...
it
violates
contemporary
standards
of
decency
and
is
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
mr.
adam
stein
well,
it
is
my
understanding
it
is
the
fact
of
incarceration
which
is
the
punishment,
and
that
everybody
who
is
within
the
prison
system
is...
and
is
a
prison
official
is
connected
with
administering
the
punishment
by
maintaining
the
incarceration
and
by
feeding
people
and
so
on.
mr.
adam
stein
this
is
not
a
municipal
case
or
a
minnell
case.
we
aren't
seeking
to
seek
the
state
or
anyone
other
than
this
person
who
himself
committed
the
act
of
which
we
complain.
we
say
he
is
like
the
police
officer
in
griffin
against
maryland
who
was
in
fact
a
private
security
guard
employed
by
glen
echo
but
had
been
deputized
by
the
county
of
maryland
to
effect
arrests,
and
when
he
did
that
arrest,
although
maryland
had
never
paid
him
or
trained
him
or
anything,
that
was
found
to
be
state
action
because
he
was
acting
with
the
authority
that
was
given.
in
this
instance,
if
it
had
been
a
private
doctor
with
a
private
person
discharging
the
person
from
care
would
have
no
effect.
you
go
down
the
street
and
see
dr.
jones.
but
when
dr.
atkins
spoke
and
said,
my
patient
won't
have
any
more
orthopedic
care
because
it
was
in
the
prison
context
that
was
the
end
of
orthopedic
care
and
indeed
although
nurses
and
other
health
care
people
and
guards
and
so
on
sought
to
have
mr.
west
cared
for
by
atkins,
atkins
was
able
to
enforce
the
order
and
never
saw
him
again,
and
the
suit
then
followed.
a
few--
mr.
adam
stein
--no,
it
hasn't.
mr.
adam
stein
just
summary
judgment.
mr.
adam
stein
yes,
sir.
the
allegations
were,
this
was
a
pro
se
complaint.
the
allegations
were
that
dr.
atkins
was
deliberately
indifferent
to
the
medical
needs
of
petitioner
quincy
west,
who
had
torn
his
achilles
tendon,
and
it
sent
on
for
a
period
of
five
months,
ending
up
with
the
appointment
with
the
examination
i
described
on
february
14th,
where
he
had
begun
by
saying,
you
need
an
operation
but
i'm
going
to
experiment
on
you
by
putting
a
cast
on
your
leg,
had
then
seen
him,
and
the
experiment
seemed
to
have
failed.
each
time
west
would
come
in,
he
would
ask
for
some
treatment
for
his
pain.
he
never
received
that.
and
then
finally
he
was
discharged
at
a
time
the
doctor
himself
was
saying,
your
achilles
tendon
hasn't
healed,
you
need
further
treatment,
and
we
say
that
is
being
deliberately
indifferent,
purposefully
withholding
the
care
that
he
said
was
needed.
and
that
is
the
basis
of
the
claim.
in
the...
briefly,
the
prison
system
in
north
carolina,
medical
care
is
provided.
there
are
some
80
units
out
there.
there
are
local
doctors
at
each
unit
who
are
responsible
for
primary
care
and
then
also
to
refer
for
specialty
care.
the
referrals
are
then
made
to
central
prison
hospital,
where
the
state
employs
specialists
to
run
12
different
specialties,
and
clinics
are
held
there
on
tuesdays
and
thursdays.
people
are
bused
in.
if
medically
able,
they
are
bused
out
after
their
appointments,
or
they
are
put
in
the
hospital
there
at
central
prison
hospital.
dr.
atkins
was
the
person
responsible
for
running
the
two
tuesday
and
thursday
orthopedic
clinics.
he
was
also
responsible
for
doing
all
the
orthopedic
operations
at
the
central
prison
hospital.
he
was
responsible
for
being
on
call
24
hours
a
day.
he
was
responsible
for
making
rounds
at
the
hospital
as
often
as
necessary
to
see
his
surgery
patients
or
his
other
orthopedic
patients.
he
would
do
this,
of
course,
in
the
prison
facility.
he'd
go
through
the
gates,
into
central
prison,
into
the
hospital,
would
conduct
the
clinics
with
clinic
supplies,
assisted
by
hospital
people,
not
people
of
his
employ,
and
the
same
thing
would
be
true
for
surgeries
and
in
the
hospital.
he
had
a
great
deal
of
responsibility
and
authority,
and
would
in
conducting
his
business
supervise
other
personnel
in
carrying
out
his
work
at
the
clinic--
mr.
adam
stein
--well,
the
record
is
not
altogether
clear
on
that.
the
record
is
limited
to
the
materials
put
in
by
dr.
atkins
on
motion
for
summary
judgment.
that
is
my
understanding,
and
i
am
taking
some
inferences
on
that
based
on
what
a
doctor
would
do
who--
mr.
adam
stein
--well,
i
think
that
we
do
know
that
some
of
them
had
to
have
been.
some
of
the
orders
are...
would
be
directed
to
transporting
people
back
and
forth,
and
the
prison
provides
regular
bus
transportation
among
its
units
back
and
forth.
we
know
that
there
are
prison
employees
who
provide
medical
care
at
the
various
units,
and
they
obey
the
orders
of
the
specialists
when
the
person
comes
back
with
the
medical
records.
we
know
that
he
is
responsible
for
directing
the
care
as
his
patients
are
there
in
the
hospital.
we
submit
that
a
person
such
as
this
is
like
the
private
policeman
in
griffin
against
maryland,
that
this...
that
his
actions
are
fairly
attributable
to
the
state.
he
plays
an
important
role
within
the
total
health
care
system
and
exercises
the
power
to
decide
what,
if
any,
treatment
orthopedic
treatment
a
prisoner
will
receive,
and
we
see
that
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that
he
had
the
power
to
deny
treatment
since
after
the
circumstance
where
he
was
telling
his
patient
that
you
need
further
care,
no
further
care
was
forthcoming,
and
others
would
repeatedly...
nurse
earp
and
the
physician's
assistants
on
the
cellblock,
and
those
are
people
who
are
prison
employees,
would
seek
to
set
up
appointments,
and
then
it
was
discovered
that
an
order
had
been
entered,
and
he
never
saw
him.
finally,
the
prisoner
filed
a
formal
complaint
with
the
grievance
commission
there
at
central
prison
complaining
that
he
wasn't
receiving
treatment
from
atkins,
he
wasn't
able
to
see
him,
that
he
continued
to
be
in
pain,
and
that
his
leg
was
swelling,
and
that
seemed
to
be
resolved
by
establishing
an
appointment
for
him
with
atkins
on
june
21st,
1984.
june
21st
came
and
went
without
him
being
taken
to
see
dr.
atkins,
and
a
week
later
he
was,
in
his
words,
abruptly
transferred
to
the
caledonia
prison
unit
some
75
miles
away.
this
suit
followed
a
few
months
later,
him
never
having
seen
dr.
atkins
again
or,
the
record
shows,
no
further
orthopedic
care.
mr.
adam
stein
yes,
sir.
mr.
adam
stein
well,
a
negligence
suit
would
have
been
easier
probably,
your
honor,
but
he
chose
his
forum,
and
he
acted
for
himself
and
filed
a
pro
se
complaint,
and
i
suppose
being
in
the
custody
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
he
was
looking
to
the
federal
court
for
the
vindication
of
his
federal
rights,
but
that
was
his
decision,
and
that
is
what
he
did.
mr.
adam
stein
my
understanding
of
north
carolina
law
is
that
he
could
have
filed
a
negligence
suit
in
state
court.
mr.
adam
stein
well,
he
could
have
sued
the
doctor.
mr.
adam
stein
well,
he
could
have
sought
to
bring
an
action
under
the
state
tort
claims
act,
which
is
a
procedure
that
is
administered
by
the
industrial
commission,
and
it
is
heard
before
a
deputy
commissioner.
however,
once
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
calvert
against
sharp
came
down
the
state
started
taking
the
position
in
the
industrial
commission
that
doctors
such
as
dr.
atkins
weren't
state
employees,
and
therefore
you
couldn't
proceed
there.
mr.
adam
stein
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
adam
stein
that's
my
reading
of
this--
mr.
adam
stein
--and
of
course
it
based
its
decision
on
its
reading
of
this
court's
rulings
in
polk
county
against
dodson,
where
there
was
language
in
there
and
some
discussion
of
a
public
defender's
professional
obligations
which
would
cause
that
public
defender
to
be
independent,
and--
mr.
adam
stein
--well,
it
did,
but
the
language
in
this
case,
and
emphasized
a
couple
times,
is
that
whenever
a
professional
is
acting
within
the
bounds
of
his
professional
discretion,
he
does
not
act
under
color
of
state
law.
mr.
adam
stein
well,
we
have
seen
recently
some
unpublished
opinions
from
the
fourth
circuit
where
we
find
that
if
a
doctor,
a
prison
doctor
is
named
in
the
suit,
he
is...
it
is...
the
broad
language
is
cited,
and
the
case
is
dismissed.
i
think
that
is
the
understanding
of
that
court.
mr.
adam
stein
there
would
never
be
a
recovery
against
the
doctor.
mr.
adam
stein
against
the
person.
mr.
adam
stein
under
federal
law.
that's
right.
and
we
submit,
of
course,
that
the
fourth
circuit
got
the
language
of
professionalism
in
polk
county
wrong,
that
what
was
important
in
the
polk
county
case
in
terms
of
the
professional
obligations
of
the
public
defender
was
her
professional
obligation
to
be
not
only
independent
but
to
be
adversarial
to
the
state.
in
fact,
the
dodson
case,
it
was
litigation
where
the
plaintiff
was
the
state
of
iowa,
state
of
iowa
against
dodson,
and
one
looks
at
that
and
sees
that
the
police
have
investigated
and
preferred
charges
in
the
state
through
its
state's
attorney.
the
district
attorney
is
prosecuting
it.
and
then
look
on
the
defendant's
side
of
the
table
and
see
it's
against
mr.
dodson,
and
there
is
his
counsel.
and
in
those
circumstances,
and
i
think
that
the
court
said
in
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
case
the
state
employee
was
not
said
to
be
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
i
would
point
out
that
even
in
that
courtroom
or
in
the
context
of
that
the
lawyer
representing
the
state
was
a
state
actor.
nothing
has
disturbed
the
court's
rulings
on
that.
so
was
the
judge,
or
the
judges.
i
think
it
was
then
before
the
state
supreme
court.
after
polk
county
against
dodson,
we
have
the
glover
case,
where
a
public
defender
was
sued,
and
he
was
found
to
be
acting
under
color
of
state
law
because
of
his
acting
in
concert
and
conspiracy
with
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
and
other
state
officials,
so
that
the
professionalism
of
the
judge
and
the
professionalism
of
the
prosecutor
didn't
cause
them
not
to
be
state
actors.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
polk
county
case
is
very
limited
and
peculiar,
and
i
would
note
that
when
a
public
defender
acts
in
a
case
of
a
criminal
defense
lawyer,
he
is
always
acting
before
the
courts,
and
judges
have
a
responsibility
if
they
see
something
wrong
going
on
to
act.
criminal
defendants
with
some
frequency
complain
about
their
lawyers,
and
if
the
complaint
has
some
merit,
the
judges
will
act.
that
is
not
true--
mr.
adam
stein
--no.
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
the
case
is
pending
in
a
court
which
would
receive
a
complaint
from
a
prisoner.
it
is
certainly
my
experience
that
when
judges
receive
that,
if
it
looks
like
there
is
any
merit
in
it,
where
there
is...
in
a
criminal
defense
situation,
that
they
will
make
some
inquiry.
and
indeed,
the
rule
that
was
involved
in
polk
county
against
dodson,
it
was
the
filing
of
the
anders
brief
which
was
complained
about,
and
the
rule
there
said
that
the
lawyer
had
to
tell
the
client,
i
am
going
to
file
a
no
merit
brief,
and
then
the
person,
mr.
dodson
then
had
the
opportunity
to
tell
the
court,
i
think
this
is
wrong,
and
please
examine
it
closely.
it
just
doesn't
have
its
counterpart
in
the
prison
system
short
of
litigation.
i
would
also
emphasize
in
terms
of
the
professionalism
idea
that
there
are
lots
of
cases
from
this
court
where
professionals
have
been
found
to
be
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
we
cited
the
youngberg
case,
where
the
act
of
exercising
a
professional
judgment
was
found
itself
to
be
the
state
action,
and
if
the
actor
exceeded
the
bounds
of
accepted
professional
judgment
in
that
instance
of
providing
certain
care
to
a
mentally
retarded
person
incarcerated
in
a
state
institution,
that
would
be
actionable
under
1983.
i
would
mention
briefly
the
blum
case,
which
was
the
case
involving
concededly
private
physicians
and
concededly
private
nursing
homes
in
new
york,
which
is
very
much
in
contrast
with
the
setting
we
have,
which
is
in
the
central
prison,
behind
walls,
a
core...
medical
care
being
a
core
function
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
state
in
providing
prison
services.
and
i
would
like
also
to
mention
that
we
are
here
construing
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
that
this
court
has
often
told
us
was
intended
to
provide
remedies
as
broad
as
the
14th
amendment,
and
i
certainly
do
submit
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
it
seems
inconceivable
to
me
that
congress
couldn't
draw
a
statute
to
allow
petitioner
to
bring
a
lawsuit
against
this
doctor
for
the
things
that
he
said
were
done.
and
finally,
i
would
say
to
the
court
that
estelle
and
the
cases
that
have
followed
it
have
identified
in
the
prison
system
serious
problems
in
medical
care
in
prisons,
reaching
constitutional
dimensions,
but
the
course
of
that
litigation
has
substantially
improved
health
care
in
the
prison
systems,
and
the
two
fine
amicus
briefs
that
were
filed
in
this
case
by
the
aclu
and
the
american
public
health
association
show
that,
and
i
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
here
in
effect
cuts
estelle
in
half,
takes
the
doctors
out
as
potential
litigants,
and
would
damage
substantially
the
progress
that
has
been
made
and
turn
us
in
the
wrong
direction.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
adam
stein
thank
you,
chief
justice.
two
points
about
estelle.
the
first
is
that
the
doctor
in
estelle
was
sued
for
what
he
did
as
a
physician,
not
what
he
did
as
an
administrator.
and
it
is
our
reading
of
estelle
that
the
failure
to
provide
medical
care
that
results
in
unnecessary
suffering
is
punishment,
and
this--
mr.
adam
stein
--no,
because...
for
several
reasons.
the
general
citizenry
aren't
incarcerated.
mr.
adam
stein
in
the
prison.
mr.
adam
stein
where
the
prison
doctor
has
the
power,
as
in
this
case,
by
withholding,
by
denying
it
himself,
he
is
denying
it
altogether,
which
is
not
true
in
the
free
world.
mr.
adam
stein
well,
that
is
not
this
case
but--
mr.
adam
stein
--i
would
say
that
it
was
if
it's
in
a
circumstance
where
the
prisoner
has
no
choice
and
no
access
to
anyone
else.
mr.
adam
stein
and
whether
the
doctor
acted
under
color
of
law,
and
that's
what
i
understood.
mr.
adam
stein
it
is.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
conclude.
