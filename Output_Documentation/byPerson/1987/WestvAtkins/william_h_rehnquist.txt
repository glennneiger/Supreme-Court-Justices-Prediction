chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
now
in
number
87-5096,
quincy
west
versus
samuel
atkins.
mr.
stein,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
north
carolina
law
were
changed,
mr.
stein,
and
north
carolina
allowed
prisoners
to
contract
out
and
find
their
own
doctors
if
they
had
a
particular
kind
of
case,
and
the
state
said,
we
will
just
pay
for
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
case
has
never
been
tried
out
on
its
facts,
has
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
were
your
allegations,
deliberate
indifference?
chief
justice
rehnquist
supervise
personnel
who
were
employed
by
the
prison?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
my
question
was,
were
these
people
he
supervised
employees
of
the
prison,
and
you
say...
when
you
say
that's
my
understanding,
do
you
mean
yes,
they
were
employees
of
the
prison,
or
that
you
really
don't
know?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
lawyer
can
certainly
advise
the
criminal
defendant
outside
of
the
courtroom,
you
know,
go
to
the
prison.
that
isn't
conducted
in
the
presence
of
any
judge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stein.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
safron.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
mr.
safron,
we
granted
certiorari
on
two
questions
involving
whether
prison
doctors
are
state
actors
under
these
circumstances.
now,
you
could
argue
for
affirmance
on
an
alternate
rationale,
but
since
it
was
summary
judgment
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
to
take
the
facts
as
resolved
against
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
and
that
is
what
the
case
is
here
now
for.
the
place
to
develop
the
medical
record
or
argue
about
a
conservative
technique
was
applied
was
somewhere
back
in
the
trial
court
if
this
court
should
reverse
on
the
state
actor.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
not
the
way
the
court
below
decided
the
case.
they
didn't
say
there
was
insufficient
allegation
of
deliberate
indifference.
they
said
this
fellow
was
not
a
state
actor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
safron.
mr.
stein,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stein.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court,
no.87-5096,
west
against
atkins
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
