justice
blackmun
mr.
stein,
i
can
understand
your
response
to
justice
white,
but
is
the
fourth
circuit
theory
really
so
apparent?
one
can
argue
that
they
relied
on
the
calvert
case,
and
the
calvert
case
had
to
do
largely
with
part-time
performance,
didn't
it?
justice
blackmun
that
certainly
is
in
the
opinion,
but
also
the
great
emphasis
on
calvert
makes
me
wonder
really
what
their
basic
theory
was.
i
don't
get
consistency
in
argument
by
the
fourth
circuit.
justice
blackmun
mr.
safron,
let
me
ask
the
converse
of
justice
o'connor's
question
of
your
opponent.
do
you
conceive
of
any
factual
situation
where
a
physician
is
liable?
justice
blackmun
mr.
safron,
if
this
litigation
proceeds
to
a
judgment
against
dr.
atkins,
will
the
state
indemnify
him?
justice
blackmun
the
very
fact
that
you
are
here
out
of
the
state
attorney
general's
office
on
a
special
assignment
perhaps
almost
indicates,
doesn't
it,
a
concession
of
state
action
under
cover
of
state
law?
justice
blackmun
well,
why
doesn't
the
doctor
have
his
own
counsel
here
instead
of
relying
on
the
state?
i
am
just
saying
the
overtones
are
that
the
state's
almost
conceding
that
he
acted
under
color
of
state
law.
justice
blackmun
let
me
ask
one
irrelevant
question
before
you
sit
down.
i
see
your
red
light
is
on.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
hippocratic
oath.
in
north
carolina
are
physicians
required
to
take
the
hippocratic
oath?
justice
blackmun
i
have,
too,
but
i
might
say
also
that
in
many
medical
graduations
the
hippocratic
oath
is
not
administered.
justice
blackmun
of
course,
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
underlying
constitutional
eighth
amendment
issue,
are
we?
we
are
concerned
with
the
statutory
issue
of
1983.
justice
blackmun
yes,
and
is
it
not
our
usual
approach
to
treat
the
statutory
issue
first
rather
than
the
constitutional
issue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
fourth
circuit.
the
respondent,
atkins,
is
a
private
physician
under
contract
with
the
state
of
north
carolina
to
provide
orthopedic
services
at
a
state
prison
hospital
on
a
part-time
basis
and
he
treated
the
petitioner
for
a
leg
injury
sustained
while
the
petitioner
was
an
inmate
in
the
prison.
the
petitioner,
alleging
that
he
was
given
inadequate
treatment,
sued
the
doctor
in
federal
court
under
a
statute
we
call
section
1983
for
violation
of
his
eighth
amendment
right
to
be
free
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
the
court
entered
summary
judgment
for
the
physician
holding
that
he
was
not
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment
and
remand
the
case.
a
physician
who
is
under
contract
with
the
state
to
provide
medical
services
to
inmates
at
a
state
prison
hospital
acts
under
color
of
state
law
when
he
treats
an
inmate.
this
result
is
not
affected
by
the
fact
that
this
respondent
was
paid
by
contract
rather
than
by
salary,
nor
by
the
fact
that
he
was
not
required
to
work
exclusively
for
the
prison.
it
is
the
physician?s
function
within
the
state
system
and
not
the
precise
terms
of
his
employment
that
is
determinative.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
