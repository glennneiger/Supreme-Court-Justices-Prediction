justice
stevens
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing
in
my
mind?
in
your
view
of
the
case
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
doctor
is
an
independent
contractor
or
a
full-time
employee.
is
that
correct?
justice
stevens
you
rely
just
on
the
fact
that
he's
a
doctor
and
doctors
are
different
because
they
have
this
professional
status.
if
it
were
a
food
service,
you
gave
an
example...
supposing
they
hired
a
caterer
to
bring
in
the...
whatever
you
call
these
food
companies
that
bring
in
food
from
outside,
and
say
they
deliberately
planned
a
diet
that
was
not...
didn't
give
the
minimum
nutritional
needs
to
the
prisoners.
they
gave
them
just
some
stuff
that
wouldn't
be
fit
to
eat,
deliberately.
they
knew
the
prisoners
would
all
suffer
in
their
health,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
would
anybody
be
liable
under
section
1983
in
that
situation,
do
you
think?
justice
stevens
how
is
that
different
from
this?
if
this
doctor
deliberately
mistreated
a
prisoner,
knowing...
just
assume.
i
know
these
facts
are
in
dispute,
of
course.
but
if
you
had
a
doctor
who
suddenly
just
decided,
i'm
going
to
make
some
money
out
of
this
but
i
don't
want
to
spend
any
time
on
it,
give
him
aspirin,
and
don't
care
what
the
trouble
is
with
him.
just
pay
no
attention.
tells
the
staff
to
do
that.
no
liability?
why
is
that
different
than
the--
justice
stevens
--he
is
not
acting
as
a
professional
should
act,
obviously.
if
he
lives
up
to
the
hippocratic
oath
and
performs
to
all
the
medical
standards,
nobody
is
going
to
be
liable
for
anything.
but
you
hypothesize
a
case
in
which
you
have
a
doctor
who
is
deliberately
indifferent
to
the
needs
of
the
prisoners
who
were
sent
to
him
for
their
care,
and
is
there
any
liability
under
1983
in
those
cases?
justice
stevens
but
why
is
that
different
from
the
food
service
company?
justice
stevens
even
though
they
are
paid
by
the
state,
and
they
carry
out...
supposing
instead
of
having
a
prison
you
contracted
out
the
prison.
you
got
a
hotel
chain
or
something
with
private
security
guards,
and
you
put
all
your
prisoners
in
custody
there
and
had
an
independent
contractor
run
the
prisons
on
behalf
of
the
state,
and
they
just
figure,
we're
going
to
make
as
much
money
out
of
this
as
we
possibly
can.
they
didn't
feed
them,
they
didn't
give
them
bathing
facilities
or
athletic...
anything
like
that,
just
warehoused
them.
would
the
state,
would
anybody
be
liable
if
they
did
that,
because
if
they
are
not,
i
suppose
that
would
be
quite
a
convenient
way
for
the
state
to
avoid
any
legal
responsibility
for
these
things.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
the
question
is
whether
that
would
mean
they
could
avoid
any
constitutional
responsibilities
to
these--
justice
stevens
--that
would
otherwise
be
state
obligations.
justice
stevens
but
here
we
have
an
individual.
justice
stevens
we
have
the
independent
contractor,
like
my
private
prison
service.
we
operate
very
inexpensively,
and
we
are
really
rather
rough,
but
are
we
liable?
justice
stevens
so
your
line
doesn't
depend
on
whether
he
is
an
agent
or
an
independent
contractor.
that
is
just
a
kind
of
service.
but
medical
services
are
immune,
even
if
provided
by
full-time
employees
of
the
hospital.
that
would
be
justice
scalia's
line,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
because
they
are
not
in
the
business
of
punishing
people.
justice
stevens
even
if
they
are
deliberately
indifferent
under
the
estelle
against
campbell
rationale.
justice
stevens
that
doesn't
[inaudible]
does
it?
justice
stevens
what
you
are
saying
is,
we
don't
need
section
1983.
there
are
lots
of
good
state
remedies
out
there.
justice
stevens
but
that
