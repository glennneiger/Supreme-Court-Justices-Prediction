mr.
jacob
l.
safron
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
are
not
here
to
argue
estelle
versus
gamble,
nor
are
we
here
to
deny
the
fact
that
an
inmate
may
sue
a
doctor
in
state
court
under
conventional
tort
liability.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
a
physician
in
a
situation
such
as
dr.
atkins
in
this
case
does
not
function
under
color
of
state
law
so
as
to
satisfy
the
jurisdictional
requirement
of
the
civil
rights
act.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
west
was
playing
volleyball
on
july
30th,
1983,
at
the
odom
correctional
institution.
he
injured
his
left
leg
while
playing
volleyball
saw
the
physician
at
the
unit,
and
was
referred
to
the
orthopedic
clinic
at
central
prison
hospital,
where
on
august
the
9th,
1983,
he
was
presented
to
dr.
atkins,
who
was
the
orthopedic
surgeon
conducting
that
particular
clinic.
there
are
a
number
of
clinics
at
central
prison
hospital.
we
also
have
another
hospital,
mccain
hospital.
there
are
130
physicians
under
contract
with
the
state
of
north
carolina
excluding
dentists
and
psychiatrists.
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
30th,
1987,
the
state
of
north
carolina
spent
$23,345,000
in
providing
medical
care
to
inmates.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
under
estelle,
if
we
have
an
administrator,
but
we
would
deny
that
under
these
facts
that
dr.
atkins
was
an
administrator.
although
he
may
have
given
medical
orders
to
medical
staff,
we
deny
that
he
is
an
administrator.
he
is
not
responsible
for
running
the
prison.
he
may
give
orders
to
a
nurse.
now,
in
this
situation--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--i
would
take
the
same
position
that
the
en
banc
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
did,
justice
o'connor,
that
if
he
is
a
doctor,
performing
medicine,
and
is
not
an
administrator,
that
he
is
not
functioning
under
color
of
state
law
merely
because
he
is
a
physician
employed
by
the
state
to
provide
medical
services.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
your
honor
please--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--i
am
not
going
to
say
that,
your
honor.
i'd
say
this.
we
have
the
case
cited
by
counsel
involving
private
guards
who
were
given
arrest
powers.
only
the
state
can
arrest,
except
of
course,
there
is
citizen's
arrest,
but
custodial
authority...
and
that
is
not
the
case
before
us,
but
custodial
authority
is
state
action.
providing
medical
care,
i
would
submit,
is
not
state
action.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
estelle,
your
honor,
establishes
deliberate
indifference.
the
defendant
doctor
in
estelle
was
the
medical
administrator
of
the
facility.
he
was
an
administrator.
he
was
in
a
supervisory
capacity.
dr.
atkins
was
not
in
a
supervisory
capacity.
now,
i
would
like
to
show
what
happened
here.
mr.
west
shows
up--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh,
yes,
i
certainly
am.
what
i
am
saying
is
this.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
no.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
let
me
present
these
example.
the
state
obviously
has
a
responsibility
to
provide
medical
care.
i
am
certainly
not
denying
that.
the
state
also
has
responsibility
to
provide
food.
if
you
had
some
company
contracting
in
the
commissary
and
that
company
somehow
served
xx,
now,
that
is
not
state
action.
the
same
way
xx
has
responsibility
to
keep
the
state
prison
heated.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
certainly
not.
under
the
facts
of
this
case
there
is
the
professional
requirement,
but
if
we
are
moving
from
that,
i
would
say
that
color
of
state
law
is
what
is
coming
into
play,
and
that
color
of
state
law
could
in
fact
be
really
unavailable
in
other
situations,
serving
food,
providing
heat.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
justice
marshall,
i
would
say
this.
a
doctor
is
a
doctor
because
he
is
licensed
by
a
medical
authority.
a
guard
can
only
be
a
guard
in
a
prison
because
he
is
hired
to
be
a
guard.
one
is
not
licensed--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--the
doctor
is
hired
to
provide
the
very
service
he
provides.
in
this
case
dr.
atkins
had
his
own
practice
a
half-dozen
blocks
away
from
the
prison,
providing
medical
services.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
this
case
is
about
what
he
did
as
a
physician.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
would
submit
there
is
a
world
of
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
a
doctor
is
a
doctor,
and
he
has...
he
is
licensed
by
the
state.
he
is
responsible
to
his
hippocratic
oath.
he
is
responsible
to
the
standards
established
by
the
american
medical
association
and
the
north
carolina
medical
association
in
this
case,
and
should
he
be
negligent
he
would
be
responsible
under
tort
law
using
the
normal
negligence
theories
in
our
state
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
didn't
say
not
responsible.
i
said
responsible
under
normal
theories.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
they
are
both
hired
by
the
state
and
that
i
will
not
disagree
with,
but--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--well,
in
this
case
i
would
argue,
and
we
haven't
gotten
to
the
facts--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--no,
your
honor,
he
was
operating
under
his
license.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
he
was
hired
by
the
state
to
provide
medical
services,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh,
yes.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
he
was.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
allegedly
he
did
wrongly,
and
therefore--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--he
would
be
liable,
as
would
any
other
doctor
be
liable
for
negligence.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
it
wasn't.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
he
was
paid
by
the
state
to
provide
medical
services
to
the
inmates
presented--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this...
obviously,
your
honor,
even
under
section
1983,
an
individual
is
responsible.
this
is
not
a
case
involving
whether
or
not
the
state
is
responsible.
the
state
provided
the
physician.
the
physician
tended
his
patient,
and
the
complaints
presented
to
the
physician,
the
doctor
provided
the
medical
care
under
his
medical
license,
the
same
medical
care
that
he
would
provide
outside
in
his
office
a
few
blocks
away.
now,
in
this
case--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--i
don't
believe
it
would,
but
of
course
under
the
facts
of
this
case
he
is
a
contractor
who
provided
two
clients
per
week.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
just
submit
that
is
a
particular
scenario
i
have
never
given
consideration
to.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
you
are
presenting
a
difficult
case.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
would
still
argue
against
liability
but
that
is
not
to
stay
there
is
no
liability
in
state--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--i
really
don't
know
if
the
food
service
company
would
in
fact
be
liable
under
section
1983.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
justice
stevens,
i
would
first
of
all
submit
that
behind
this
case,
i
believe,
is
the
very
question
you
are
asking.
the
question
of
privitization--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--is
really
the
specter
that
is
the
subscript
of
the
arguments
being
made.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it
would
appear
to
me,
and
that
is
not
the
case
in
front
of
us,
that
there
are
certain
basic
obligations
that
if
a
private
company
assumes
certain
basic
obligations
and
with
the
intent--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--that
would
otherwise
be
state,
but
state
obligations
are
still
private
obligations
under
section
1983.
the
state
of
north
carolina
or
any
other
state
is
not
a
proper
defendant
in
a
1983--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--but
still--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--in
that
particular
instance
it
would
appear
to
me
that
the
officials
in
the
state,
any
state
have
an
obligation
to
review
what
services
are
being
provided
in
that
regard,
and
injunctive
relief
would
certainly
be
available
through
the
state
administrators.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that's
what
i--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--that's
what
i--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--that
was
the
line
i
had
attempted
to
start
with,
justice.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that
there
is
a
difference
between
being
a
prison
guard
and
providing
security
and
providing
many
of
the
services,
medical,
food,
clothing,
laundry...
there's
a
plethora
of
obvious
responsibilities,
but
which
are
separate
and
apart
from
punishment
and
providing
the
security.
being
a
guard,
you
can
only
be
a
guard
under
color
of
state
law.
you
can
run
a
laundry.
you
can
run
a
commissary.
you
can
provide
medical
services.
you
can
be
a
heating
contractor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
justice--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--the
point
i
am
really
trying
to
make
is,
there
is
still
liability
under
normal
standards
of
tort
law
which
is
much
less
than
the
civil
rights
standard.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
not
really,
your
honor.
no,
it
doesn't.
it
has
to
do
with
if
it's
punishment,
if
it's
security--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--yes,
your
honor,
there
are.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
situation
we
have
is
that
on
august
the
9th,
1983,
mr.
west
is
presented
to
dr.
atkins
with
a
complaint
of
a
torn
achilles
tendon.
dr.
atkins
provided
what
in
fact
is
the
conservative
treatment.
i
have
run
through
the
computer
and
found
a
case
and
i
would
like
to
leave...
i
mean
article
i
would
like
to
leave
with
the
clerk.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
this.
he
provided
a
conservative
treatment,
put
on
a
long
leg
cast
on
august
9th--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--i'd
like
to
get
back
to
the
facts.
that's
it
here.
he
provided
the
most
conservative
treatment.
he
was
paid
for
his
clinic.
in
fact,
he
would
have
been
paid
extra
for
surgery.
at
his
own
election
he
provided
the
conservative
treatment,
put
on
a
long
legged
cast,
ordered
mr.
west
to
return
in
three
weeks,
and
when
he
returned
in
three
weeks
the
cast
was
broken
off
at
the
ankle,
permitting--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--if
your
honor
please,
we
of
course
are
arguing
in
light
of
calvert
versus
sharp,
which
was
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
several
weeks
before
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
served.
based
on
calvert
versus
sharp,
the
response
in
this
case
adopted
calvert
versus
sharp.
the
lack
of
state
action
under
polk
county
versus
dodson,
under
blum
versus
yaretsky,
and
the
medical
record
was
not
developed
because
obviously
we
wanted
to
see
if
we
could
trust
the
calvert-sharp
rationale.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
we
are
arguing
that
this
is
not
state
action.
we
are
going
back
to
some
of
the
very
recent
cases
of
this
court,
the
whitley
versus
albers
decision
involving
the
shooting,
in
which
this
court
held
that
unless
there
is
wantonness
there
is
no
eighth
amendment
violation.
we
are
supporting...
we
are
going
back
to
the
daniels
versus
williams
case,
the
trip
and
fall
in
the
pichmond
county
jail,
that
mere
negligence
is
not
a
civil
rights
violation.
the
davidson
versus
cannon
last
term
in
which--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--and
that
is...
and
we
are
relying,
of
course,
on
the
en
banc
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
that
under
polk
county
versus
dodson,
the
same
way
that
a
full-time
public
defender
is
not
a
state
actor,
we
are
submitting
that
a
doctor
has
his
responsibilities
under
the
appropriate
standards
of
medicine
the
way
the
attorney
who
is
the
public
defender
has
his
responsibilities
under
the
appropriate
canons
of
ethics,
and
that
regardless
of
the
fact
that
one
is
a
full-time
employee,
that
does
not
turn
one
into
someone
who
functions
under
color
of
state
law
so
as
to
subject
him
or
her
to
1983
jurisdiction,
because
unless
there
is
in
fact
jurisdiction
over
the
individual,
unless
a
person
is
a
state
actor,
there...
this
is
an
inappropriate
forum
under
section
1983.
and,
of
course,
taking
blum
versus
yaretsky,
we
would
submit
in
light
of
blum
that
providing
medical
care
is
not
the
exclusive
prerogative
of
any
state.
doctors
provide
medical
care
to
patients
in
and
out
of
prison.
orthopedic
surgeons
provide
medical
care,
and
this
is
not
the
exclusive
prerogative
so
as
to
give
rise
to
the
color
of
state
action,
which
gives
rise
to
1983
jurisdiction,
and
basically
that
is
the
argument
we
are
presenting,
and
that
is
the
argument
we
are
relying
on,
one
which
the
fourth
circuit
en
banc
found
sufficient,
just
as
false
imprisonment
does
not
become
a
section
1983
violation,
which
this
court
held
in
baker
versus
mccollam,
just
as
in
paul
versus
davis
defamation
does
not
become
a
1983
violation,
doesn't
rise
to
a
constitutional
violation.
we
are
submitting
that
an
allegation
of
malpractice,
as
this
court
stated
in
estelle
versus
gamble
also
does
not
convert
allegations
of
malpractice
into
a
civil
rights
violation
under
section
1983,
subjecting
that
physician
to
federal
court
jurisdiction
and
requiring
him
to
respond
in
yet
another
form,
and
a
form
which
is
outside
malpractice
policies,
and
as
a
result--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--at
that
point,
your
honor,
we're
getting
into
language
of
wantonness
that
this
court
used
in
whitley
versus
albers.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
would
still
argue,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
forum,
and
because
there
was
a
forum,
which
is
the
state
courts,
under
a
much
reduced
standard
than
under
section
1983,
that
the
inmate
has
a
forum
available
to
him,
and
with
the
forum
available
to
him--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--he
is
not
a
state
actor
because
he
is
not
functioning
under
color
of
state
law.
he
is
functioning
under
his
medical
license
and
under
the--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--under
the
facts
you
are
presenting,
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
that
that
particular
doctor
would
be
violating
his
hippocratic
oath,
would
be
violating
the
standards
established--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--the
rationale
is
that
he
has
his
medical
license,
and
that--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--that
he
is
a
professional.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
would
argue
that
he
is
still
the
professional,
and
as
the
professional
his
obligations
under
his
medical
license,
his
obligations
to
the
state
medical...
to
the
state
medical
standards,
american
medical
standards,
that
if
he
acts
in
this
fashion
there
is,
recourse,
recourse
at
a
much
lower
level
than
under
the
federal
civil
rights
act.
negligence
requires
much
less
than
civil
rights
violation.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
obviously,
doctors
don't
execute
sentences,
your
honor.
that's
obvious.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
whether
or
not
punishment
is
being
imposed
is,
i
think,
the
crux.
whether
or
not--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--well,
obviously,
but
i
meant
by
the
particular
individual
who
is
asserted
to
be
the
state
actor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it
would
seem
to
me,
your
honor,
that
if
the
doctor
is
functioning
as
a
physician--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--no,
your
honor,
control,
i
think,
is
the
substance,
and
control
over
an
inmate
in
terms
of
imposing
the
security,
imposing
the
punishment--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--in
terms
of
the
normal
requirements,
that...
he
has...
he
is
practicing
medicine.
he
is
not
maintaining
the
security
of
the
institution.
he
is
not
a
guard
who
maintains
security.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
mr.
west
was
a
prisoner
when
dr.
atkins
was
treating
him.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
am
sure
there
were
guards
present.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
obviously,
and
i
am
sure--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--but
not
dr.
atkins'
restraint.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
doctor
is
present
practicing
his
profession.
there
may
be
a
guard
present
maintaining
the
security
of
the
institution.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
he
is
not
an
individual
imposing
security
of
the
institution,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
justice
marshall,
yes,
because
he
is
not
imposing
the
security
of
the
institution,
he
is
merely
providing
the
medical
care.
there
may
be
a
guard
present,
maintaining
the
security,
but
that
is
not
dr.
atkins'
or
any
other
physician's
responsibility
or
mission.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
well,
the
reason
we
are
here
is
because
the
statutes
were
amended
permitting
the
attorney
general
to
represent
medical
professionals
when
claims
of
civil
rights
violations
arose.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
what
happened,
the
statutes
were
amended.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
state
does
not
provide
representation
in
the
normal
malpractice
situation,
but
a
civil
rights
situation,
being
outside
the
medical
malpractice
policy,
in
order
to
hire
physicians
we
were
permitted
to
come
in
on
the
civil
rights
aspects,
provide
representation,
because
otherwise
the
recruiting--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--no,
your
honor,
we
are
just
making
sure
that
we
can
recruit
physicians
because
when
they
are
sued
under
color
of
state
law
they
are
on
their
own.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i,
in
seeing
films
of
graduations
of
the
university
of
north
carolina
school
of
medicine,
i
have
seen
it
being
given.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
can't
speak
nationally,
your
honor.
