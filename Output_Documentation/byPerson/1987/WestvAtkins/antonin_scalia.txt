justice
scalia
mr.
stein,
you
said
he
is
doing
the
state's
work.
he
is
doing
the
state's
work,
but
is
he
doing
the
state's
punishment?
i
mean,
this
is
a
cause
of
action
for
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
don't
you
have
to
identify
someone
in
the
state
system
who
is
responsible
for
the
carrying
out
of
the
punishment,
just
as
in
the
municipal
cases
you
have
to
identify
somebody
who
is
responsible
for
the
municipal
policy.
justice
scalia
but
that
is
in
no
sense
the
punishment
that
the
state
is
imposing.
they
don't
sentence
you
to
medical
treatment.
justice
scalia
well,
that
is
malpractice,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
is
punishment.
justice
scalia
i
see
that
that
goes
beyond
negligence,
but
it
is
not
enough
to
go
beyond
negligence.
you
have
to
go
all
the
way
to
punishment,
and
i
don't
see
how
this
individual
had
any
responsibility
for
the
administering
of
the
state's
punishment.
justice
scalia
it's
an
infliction
of
harm,
but
i
don't
know
that
anyone
would
call
it
an
infliction
of
punishment
unless
that
individual
had
the
responsibility
for
carrying
out
the
state's
sentence.
what
about
the
janitor
who
wipes
up
the
floors
in
the
prison?
if
he
is
a
particularly
spiteful
fellow
and
leaves
them
soaped
so
that
people
will...
intentionally
so
that
people
will
slip
on
them,
would
you
say
that
is
part
of...
he
is
administering
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
justice
scalia
the
person
who's
responsible
for
administering
the
state
sentence,
if
he
is
knowingly
responsible
for
that,
you
certainly
have
him
under
1983,
but
don't
you
have
to
reach
somebody
who
is
responsible
for
executing
the
sentence
upon
the
individual
somehow,
someone
who
is
in
charge
of
administering
the
punishment.
justice
scalia
you
don't
say
in
the
municipal
area
that
every
agent
of
the
city
is
the
city
for
purposes
of
municipal
liability.
we
try
to
reach
somebody
who
establishes
policy
for
the
city.
why
shouldn't
it
be
the
same
for
the
prison?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
before
you
go
through
that,
i
don't...
from
what
you've
said
i
don't
understand
whether
you've
abandoned
the
professional
requirement
or
not.
justice
scalia
you
are
sticking
by
the...
so--
justice
scalia
--so
the
janitor
who
soaps
the
floor
would
indeed
be
liable?
justice
scalia
no?
he
is
not
a
professional,
i
don't
think.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
so
you
are
abandoning
the
professional
requirement,
unless
you
consider
serving
food
to
be
a
profession.
justice
scalia
--as
opposed
to
those
who
are
doctors
and
food
servers
or
whatever
else?
justice
scalia
isn't
that
a
fairly
discernible
line?
justice
scalia
i
know.
i
thought
maybe
you
forgot
it.

[generallaughter.]
justice
scalia
mr.
safron,
i
had
thought--
--is
the
point
that
he...
go
ahead.
i
had
thought
your
point
was
that
he
was
a
state
actor
but
was
not
a
state
actor
for
the
purpose
of
imposing
punishment,
and
that's
all
that
the
eighth
amendment
covers,
and
therefore
he
can't
be
a
state
actor.
he
may
be
a
state
actor
for
purposes
of
some
other
1983
violations,
but
not
for
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
unless
he
is
a
state
actor
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
sentence
of
the
state,
and
doctors
are
not.
justice
scalia
nor
are
food
service
people,
so
really
it
doesn't
depend
on
the
professional
thing
at
all.
justice
scalia
well,
it
is
surely
being
imposed.
the
issue
is
that
this
person
has
to
be
one
responsible
for--
justice
scalia
mr.
stein,
you
can't
mean
that.
suppose
a
state
adopts
a
state
medicare
system
that
all
medical
services
will
be
provided
to
the
general
population
at
state
expense,
and
you
get
a
physician
who
does
what
this
physician
is
alleged
to
have
done
here,
intentionally
withholds
care.
would
that
be
an
eighth
amendment
claim
for
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
justice
scalia
all
right,
so
you
don't
mean
that
simply
the
denial
of
medical
care
is
in
itself
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
justice
scalia
ah,
in
the
prison
context.
justice
scalia
so
in
the
example
i
just
gave
you,
if
a
doctor
treated
somebody
in
the
general
population
and
intentionally
withheld
care,
that
would
not
be
an
eighth
amendment
violation,
but
under
the
same
general
state
medicare
scheme,
if
he
treated
a
prisoner,
that
would
be
an
eighth
amendment
violation,
in
the
same
office,
the
prisoner
is
brought
to
his
office,
he
treats
the
same
individual.
he
doesn't
even
know
who
are
prisoners,
who
are
not
prisoners.
in
one
case
he
is
guilty
of
acting
under
color
of
state
law
and
inflicting
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
in
the
other
case
not.
justice
scalia
i
know
that.
