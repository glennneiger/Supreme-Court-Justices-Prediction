justice
white
(inaudible)
this
is
mississippi
sound
or
not?
justice
white
why
does
that
--
why
does
chandeleur
sound
come
into
the
case?
justice
white
well,
why
didn't
they
consider
it?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
you
have
to
address
our
--
address
our
opinion
then.
before
chandeleur
sound
is
involved,
you
have
to
convince
us
this
master
was
wrong
in
construing
our
remand.
justice
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
well,
tell
--
tell
me
why
the
master
was
wrong
in
that
regard.
justice
white
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
is
it
whether
the
master
was
right
or
wrong
in
saying
that
the
remand
was
a
narrow
one,
everybody
agrees
that
you're
going
to
have
to
finish
up
the
case
anyway.
he's
going
to
have
to
deal
with
chandeleur
sound
some
time.
well,
about
the
accuracy
of
--
of
what
he
did?
justice
white
what
you
did
--
all
right,
that
that's
--
justice
white
isn't
that
issue
that
we
have
before
us?
was
he
right
to
the
extent
that
he
set
the
coastline?
justice
white
it
was
one
of
the
issues,
isn't
it?
was
he
right
in
setting
the
coastline
to
the
extent
that
he
set
a
coastline?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
can
you
object
to
what
he
did?
you
say
the
--
justice
white
--
the
master
was
wrong?
justice
white
and
you're
going
to
argue
that,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
from
alaska?
justice
white
you
would
close
chandeleur
--
chandeleur
sound
from
the
south
end
of
chandeleur
islands
over
to
the
delta?
justice
white
and
then
--
and
then
chandeleur
sound
is
divided
between
mississippi
and
louisiana.
justice
white
no
that's
louisiana.
justice
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
was
not
--
it
was
not
a
juridical
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
historic
bay.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
master
--
and
this
court
have
found
for
the
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
--
so
that
mississippi's
southern
boundary
were
those
islands.
justice
white
but
the
--
justice
white
in
our
remand
--
our
most
recent
remand
was
just
for
the
purpose
of
actually
defining
that
line
drawn
along
--
where
did
the
line
run
along
those
islands.
justice
white
you
mean
chandeleur
sound?
justice
white
figure
one.
justice
white
what
did
you
do?
did
you
make
--
did
you
make
that
--
that
part
of
chandeleur
sound
--
justice
white
--
below
that
line?
did
you
recognize
that
as
louisiana
waters?
justice
white
well,
where
did
that
southern
line
close?
from
the
southern
end
of
chandeleur
island
over
to
where?
justice
white
but
the
--
justice
white
but
the
--
but
you
don't
concede
anything
about
the
nature
of
chandeleur
sound?
justice
white
and
--
justice
white
and
as
long
as
mississippi
doesn't
accept
it,
you
--
you
say
that
the
--
that
the
limit
of
her
authority
in
the
submerged
land
act
is
three
miles
outside
of
the
--
that
--
those
barrier
islands.
justice
white
and
if
they
want
--
if
they
want
to
start
another
action,
you
say
that
have
started.
justice
white
(inaudible)
to
louisiana
by
the
way
on
that
settlement?
justice
white
you
have
conceded
that
it's
--
that
it's
a
--
you
haven't
conceded
that
legally
louisiana
is
entitled
to
what.
you
have
agreed
to
recognize.
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
if
you
--
if
there
were
further
litigation
and
you
won
on
the
law
that
mississippi
wasn't
entitled
to
any
part
of
chandeleur
sound
that
then
louisiana
would
just
have
a
better
deal
in
chandeleur
sound
than
mississippi,
that's
all.
justice
white
after
you
have
lost
the
case,
you
moved
to
amend
your
complaint?
justice
white
they
won
the
case.
they
want
to
win
some
more.
justice
white
(inaudible)
sound
that
just
rely
on
your
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
litigation
--
what
was
it,
u.s.
against
louisiana?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
is
this
special
master
been
working
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
maybe
he
better
get
a
colleague
with
him
if
he
--
justice
white
i
couldn't
think
of
any
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
when
did
you
find
out
about
the
agreement
that
the
united
states
had
made
with
louisiana
with
respect
to
chandeleur
sound.
justice
byron
r.
white
mississippi
--
the
state
of
mississippi.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
did
this
case
began?
i
mean
this
face
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
1979
and
yet
you
framed
your
case
--
you
focused
the
case
strictly
on
mississippi
sound.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
claim
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
your
line
was
those
barrier
islands.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
despite
the
fact
that
you
knew
the
united
states
had
made
a
deal
with
louisiana
recognizing
louisiana's
right
to
some
portion
of
chandeleur
sound.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
would
think
that
could
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
been
rather
impressive.
justice
white
what
error?
justice
white
just
on
this
latest
remand?
justice
white
well,
it
wasn't
in
your
--
justice
white
--
it
wasn't
in
your
--
it
wasn't
in
your
complaint.
justice
white
when
did
you
first
put
it
in
the
case?
justice
white
in
this
report
or
in
the
prior
--
justice
white
but
it
hasn't
been
raised
at
the
time
we
last
remanded
to
the
special
master.
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
the
original
--
justice
white
--
submission
of
the
remand.
