mr.
jim
r.
bruce
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
location
of
mississippi's
coastline
and
the
extent
of
its
seaward
boundaries.
during
the
course
of
my
argument,
i
will
be
referring
to
charts
which
were
included
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
state
of
alaska,
as
well
as
figure
number
two
included
in
the
report
of
the
special
master.
now,
in
the
previous
proceeding
before
this
court,
we
were
all
focusing
on
the
question
of
whether
mississippi
sound
constituted
inland
waters.
we
presented
our
case
and
this
court
agreed
that
it
was
inland
waters
and
directed
the
master
to
frame
an
appropriate
decree.
and
approaching
that
task,
the
master
was
faced
with
a
problem
as
he
approached
the
western
end
of
mississippi
sound,
the
area
where
mississippi
sound
meets
the
waters
of
chandeleur
sound
south.
obvious
solution
to
the
problem
was
that
a
corner
had
to
be
drawn
somewhere
closing
both
of
these
areas
of
inland
waters.
the
master,
however,
felt
constrained
not
to
deal
with
an
issue
which
appeared
to
be
obvious
in
light
of
the
court's
previous
opinion
that
is
necessary
and
obvious
for
establishing
a
coastline.
now,
the
solicitor
general's
argument
is
confusing
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
suggesting
remand
or
at
this
case,
as
at
an
end
and
that
no
further
proceeding
should
be
taken.
he
says
this
is
a
case
about
mississippi
sound
only
and
that
it
should
be
reserved
for
a
supplemental
decree.
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
today
is
to
remand
this
case
with
instructions
to
the
master
so
that
he
can
deal
with
the
coastline
question
in
a
logical
manner
and
not
feel
foreclosed
from
recommending
a
proper
decree
in
the
case.
that's
the
solicitor
general's
position
too
and
we
all
agreed
on
remand
and
there's
no
issue
for
this
court
to
decide.
however,
if
the
government
is
arguing
that
the
case
is
over,
we
contend
that
they
are
wrong.
mississippi
sound
or
chandeleur
sound
of
the
south
or
inland
waters
or
at
least
this
court
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
sir.
both
of
these
bodies
of
water
have
been
characterized
by
this
court
as
inland
waters.
in
fact,
in
the
last
proceeding,
the
court
held
that
mississippi
sound
was
in
fact
inland
waters.
the
two
sounds
are
at
right
angles
to
each
other
and
are
separated
from
one
another
by
cat
island,
west
ship
island,
and
east
ship
island.
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
note
that
ship
island
in
the
past
has
been
a
single
island.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
no,
your
honor.
basically,
that
was
disposed
of
their
last
proceeding
for
this
court.
the
question
now
is
where
the
coastline
should
be
located
that
it
should
taken
to
consideration
the
inland
waters
of
chandeleur
sound
as
well.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
well,
because
the
master
in
his
report
was
attempting
to
delineate
the
coastline
of
mississippi.
in
order
to
delineate
the
coastline
of
mississippi,
you
have
to
determine
the
limits
of
inland
waters.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
he
felt
that
he
was
foreclosed
by
this
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--
court's
previous
opinion
from.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
well,
we
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
i
--
i
would
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
well,
i
think
first
of
all
in
the
opinion,
the
court
noted
that
this
was
a
very
narrow
question
involving
only
mississippi
sound
or
at
least
that's
the
way
i
read
the
very
beginning
of
this
opinion.
the
parties
were
much
agreed
that
chandeleur
sound
was
inland
waters.
in
fact,
the
united
states
has
offered
a
concession
to
a
part
of
chandeleur's
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--
inland
waters.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor,
because
we
felt
that
the
offer
was
less
than
what
we
were
entitled
to
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
and
of
course
the
question
as
to
the
status
of
chandeleur
sound
was
raised
before
the
previous
master
and
was
presented
to
this
court
under
the
claim
of
a
straight
baseline.
i
think
the
problem
that
we
have
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
your
honor,
that
would
been
back,
i
believe,
in
early
1983
prior
to
the
time
the
master
had
submitted
his
previous
recommendation.
in
fact,
the
master
notes
on
page
24
of
this
opinion
in
his
footnote,
that
mississippi
did
raise
the
question
of
the
status
of
chandeleur
sound.
in
addition,
we
believe
that
there
are
other
opinions
of
this
court
which
have
recognized
chandeleur
sound
as
inland
waters.
if
you
go
back
to
the
1906
decision
of
louisiana
versus
mississippi,
the
question
there
was
the
boundary
between
the
state
of
mississippi
and
the
state
of
louisiana.
i
think
in
that
regard,
it's
interesting
to
look
at
what
the
parties
were
claiming
and
specifically,
what
the
court
said
about
chandeleur
sound.
in
that
case,
of
course,
the
state
of
louisiana
asked
for
a
decree
defining
its
boundary
line
as
the
deep
water
channel.
i
think
the
language
of
that,
which
the
court
repeated,
is
important.
louisiana
asked
that
the
boundary
extend
through
mississippi
sound,
north
of
isle
of
petit
through
cat
island
pass
southwest
of
cat
island,
through
chandeleur
sound,
northeast
of
chandeleur
islands
to
the
gulf
of
mexico.
now,
very
clearly,
the
court
was
under
the
impression
in
that
length
or
at
least
louisiana
was
under
the
impression
that
the
gulf
of
mexico
began
eastward
of
the
chandeleur
islands.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
well,
we
think
that
there
are
some
serious
problems
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--
with
the
act
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
no,
your
honor,
he
was
not.
and
we
submit
that
for
several
reasons.
the
first
reason
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
well,
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
one
of
the
issues
for
the
court
to
consider
in
deciding
whether
to
affirm
the
report
of
the
special
master.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
and
if
--
if
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
we
do,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
he
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
a
number
of
things
that
we
object
to
about
the
special
master's
report
and,
of
course,
the
statement
from
louisiana
versus
mississippi
is
an
early
legal
precedent,
we
believe,
that
shows
that
he
is
wrong.
the
court
in
its
final
decree
in
that
case,
interestingly
enough
attached
a
map
that
made
it
a
part
of
the
decree.
and
if
you
look
at
that
map,
you'll
find
that
the
boundary
line
which
the
court
delineated
runs
into
the
chandeleur
sound.
in
fact,
it
runs
off
the
paper
because
all
of
the
chandeleur
sound
was
not
shown.
in
addition,
the
court
commenting
on
what
louisiana
had
argued
made
it
very
clear
as
to
where
chandeleur
sound
began
and
ended
and
where
the
gulf
of
mexico
began
and
ended.
the
court
said,
“to
get
into
the
open
water
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
beyond
chandeleur
islands
and
around
to
the
western
boundary
of
louisiana,
it
is
necessary
to
follow
as
louisiana
contends
the
deep
water
channel
through
mississippi
sound
and
fenced
by
the
pass
between
cat
island
and
isle
of
petit,
north
of
the
chandeleur
islands
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
read
that
language.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
sir.
north
--
north
of
the
chandeleur
islands
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
so,
the
court
seems
to
very
clearly
and
expressly
had
stated
its
opinion
that
the
gulf
of
mexico
began
beyond
the
chandeleur
islands,
northern
part
of
the
chandeleur
islands.
the
master's
report
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
i
--
i
think
that
could
be
an
argument
that
would
be
made
to
oppose
as,
however,
they
issue
presented
to
the
court
well
as
the
location
of
the
boundary
between
mississippi
and
louisiana.
and,
of
course,
the
court
found
that
the
boundary
of
louisiana
went
all
the
way
to
the
gulf
of
mexico,
so
in
order
to
resolve
that,
the
court
would
have
had
to
decide
it
where
the
gulf
of
mexico
began.
so,
i
think
it
could
be
argued
that
way,
but
i
would
think
that
the
--
it
was
material
to
the
determination
issue
and
that
it
was
the
lateral
boundary
between
the
two
states.
the
other
problem
--
one
of
the
other
problems
that
we
find
with
the
master's
report
and
that
is
that
the
--
the
recommendation
if
accepted
would
divest
mississippi
of
approximately
150
square
miles
of
territory
which
the
united
states
has
been
recognizing
for
the
most
part
of
this
century.
and
which
the
united
states
at
this
point
has
been
willing
to
offer
a
partial
concession.
in
1965,
in
the
louisiana
case,
california
attempt
to
--
i'm
sorry,
in
the
california
case,
california
attempted
to
analogize
santa
barbara
channel
to
chandeleur
sound
and
the
united
states
was
very
quick
to
respond,
these
are
two
different
cases.
chandeleur
sound
which
we
recognized
as
inland
waters
and
that
it
went
on
with
it's
--
to
contrast
the
two.
the
court
picked
up
on
that
in
a
footnote
and
said
something
to
defect
chandeleur
sound
which
the
united
states
claims
as
inland
waters.
so,
this
court
has
been
confronted
with
that
that
united
states
hasn't
passed
knowledge
that
at
least
part
of
chandeleur
sound
was
inland
waters.
and,
of
course,
in
the
1981
filed
decree
in
louisiana
versus
mississippi,
the
whole
decree
seems
to
be
premised
on
the
fact
that
there
is
lateral
boundary
between
mississippi
and
louisiana.
if
chandeleur
sound
is
not
inland
waters,
i
submit
there
is
no
lateral
boundary
and
that
the
decree
lacks
definiteness
and
it
creates
a
real
problem.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
and
that
was
decided,
of
course,
in
louisiana
versus
mississippi
in
1960
as
well
the
court
held
that
was
the
mainland
of
louisiana.
isle
of
petit
is
the
furthest
extension
of
the
louisiana
mainland.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
in
addition
to
that,
those
problems
we
feel
that
the
master
confused
the
terms
“boundary”
and
“coastline",
of
course,
the
two
are
distinct,
the
boundary
is
located
three
miles
seaward
of
the
coastline,
the
coastline
being
define
as
the
limited
inland
waters
and
the
--
or
water
mark
along
that
part
of
the
coast
and
direct
contact
with
the
open
sea.
now,
by
confusing
the
terms,
the
master
not
only
deprived
mississippi
of
the
claims
of
chandeleur
sound
inland
waters,
but
at
the
same
time,
took
away
all
of
mississippi's
territorial
sea
all
along
its
coastal
front.
another
problem
that
has
been
raised
is
the
treatment
of
the
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
that
is
not.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
submit
that
the
proper
closing
line
should
have
been
the
line
mark
six
from
east
ship
island
down
to
the
northern
tip
of
the
chandeleur
sound.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
from
the
eastern
tip
of
ship
island,
we
would
have
close
that
down
to
the
chandeleur
islands.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
mississippi
would
be
entitled
only
to
that
area,
north
of
its
lateral
boundary
with
louisiana.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
oh,
i
see.
your
honor,
the
line
would
--
would
continue
south
around
the
outer
extremity
of
the
chandeleur
islands,
continue
on
south
and
then
close
across
an
area
which
is
not
shown
on
this
map,
chandeleur
islands,
the
united
states
has
drawn
a
closing
line
for
its
agreement
to
louisiana
down
to
the
mississippi
delta.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
(inaudible)
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
no,
your
honor.
just
that
part
of
chandeleur
sound,
north
of
the
lateral
boundary
separating
mississippi
and
louisiana.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
no,
that
would
be
north
of
line
number
five,
your
honor.
now,
let's
see
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
your
honor,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i
--
i
understand
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
the
--
the
coastline
would
follow
the
outer
fringe
of
the
chandeleur
islands
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--
down
to
the
mississippi
delta.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
sir,
and
it
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
no,
your
honor.
that
would
not
be.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor.
basically,
you
would
use
the
closing
line
down
to
the
lateral
boundary
and
follow
the
lateral
boundary
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
that's
correct.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
the
northern
part
of
it
would
be,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
no,
your
honor.
that
wouldn't
be
southern
part
of
chandeleur
sound
and
breton
sounds
which
also
have
been
recognized
of
inland
waters
would
belong
to
louisiana.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
well,
i
don't
think
that
he
has
decided
what
state
it's
in.
i
think
he
decided
what
it
is
not
in
and
that
is
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
it
appears
from
what
the
master
said
that
he
was
fixing
our
boundary
and
as
that
term
is
used
and
the
term
coastline
is
used
that
would
limit
state
as
to
how
far
it
go.
and
he
makes
the
coastline
go
between
the
islands,
it
does
not
even
give
us
a
three-mile
limit.
so
that
leaves
along
finger
of
land
in
there
which
we
estimate
to
be
somewhere
around
150
square
miles
that
would
belong
to
mississippi.
that
does
create
some
problems.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
i'm
sorry.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
the
problems
that
this
would
raise
also
under
the
decree
--
a
1981
decree
in
louisiana,
the
louisiana
case,
the
court
awarded
to
louisiana
all
of
the
land
west
to
the
closing
line
to
chandeleur
sound
subject
to
the
location
of
the
lateral
boundary.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
sir.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
i
suppose
the
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--
court
could
view
it
that
way.
we
did
file
an
exception
that
is
that
mississippi
sound
and
chandeleur
sound
were
inland
waters
by
virtue
of
a
straight
baseline.
the
court
did
not
address
that
particular
issue
limited
itself
to
this
historic
bay
claim.
it
did
not
address
the
juridical
bay
claim
in
which
the
master
raised,
who
said
it
was
not
necessary
and
decided
the
case
on
historic
bay.
along
with
that,
of
course,
we
felt
that
with
the
--
with
the
case
law
with
the
statements
by
the
united
states
over
long
period
of
time
that
there
was
no
dispute
to
the
fact
that
mississippi
sound
was
inland
--
i'm
sorry,
the
chandeleur
sound
was
inland
waters,
and
the
only
question
we
have
to
decide
was
the
closing
line
between
the
two.
as
i
say
in
the
previous
proceeding,
we
were
focusing
more
on
the
question
of
those
on
place
high
seas
beside
mississippi
sound.
that
was
the
thing
that
--
that
took
most
of
the
attention.
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
in
this
case
is
remand
to
the
master
so
that
he
can
consider
and
determine
the
status
of
chandeleur
sound
as
inland
waters
and
recommend
an
appropriate
decree
to
the
court.
in
this
respect,
we
specifically
request
that
he
be
directed
to
consider
evidence
with
the
use
of
straight
baselines
by
the
united
states
for
delimiting
the
chandeleur
sound
and
the
applicability
of
article
4
of
the
geneva
convention
on
the
territorial
sea.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
your
honor,
we
would
feel
that
if
we
lost
after
being
referred
back
to
the
master
that
another
original
action
would
not
be
permissible.
and
furthermore,
we
think
that
referral
back
to
the
master
at
this
time
would
not
only
be
saving
in
time,
and
this
area,
of
course,
is
very
--
an
area
the
people
are
very
much
interested
in
because
the
oil
and
gas
leasing
activity
and
we
would
certainly
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
all
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
if
the
master
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
i
think
that
--
that
would
be
questionable
as
to
whether
we
could
or
not.
certainly,
if
we
did,
i
think,
we
would
be
faced
with
the
same
problem
that
we
have
with
this
master
that
he
would
be
reluctant
to
entertain
something
that
he
feels
the
court
has
already
viewed
and
passed
on.
and
that
--
i
think
that's
the
real
problem
we
have
with
the
master's
report.
he
did
not
consider
the
evidence,
straight
baseline
use,
the
long
history
of
claims
about
the
united
states
because
he
felt
this
court
in
its
last
opinion
had
precluded
him
from
making
such
findings.
he
said
in
view
of
the
court's
previous
opinion,
the
only
way
this
could
be
inland
waters
is
by
agreement
or
if
the
united
states
subsequently
uses
system
straight
baselines.
so,
i
--
i
think
the
master
would
be
reluctant
to
entertain
further
action.
he
would
feel
that,
if
this
court
--
court
had
the
opportunity
and
did
not
reverse,
it
would
be
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
your
honor?
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
he
certainly
would.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
you
mean
why
would
mississippi
be
entitled
of
anything
greater
than
what
the
united
states
has
offered?
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
we
have
evidence.
of
course,
the
decision
in
louisiana
versus
mississippi
would
tend
to
support
that
that
this
area
has
also
been
included
as
part
of
chandeleur
sound
and
that
chandeleur
sound
in
its
entirety
is
inland
waters.
now,
the
question
you
may
be
asking,
and
that
is,
“is
it
unusual
to
have
dog
leg,
so
to
speak,
with
having
that
the
boundary
dropped
back?”
it's
not
unheard
of.
in
fact,
congress
fully
anticipated
that
when
they
passed
the
submerged
lands
act.
florida
has
a
three-league
boundary.
mississippi
and
alabama
have
a
three-mile
boundary,
so
does
louisiana.
texas
has
a
three-league
boundary.
so,
the
coastline
as
you're
going
from
florida
to
alabama
drops
in
roughly
seven
miles.
florida
and
texas
have
a
seven
more
miles
of
territorial
sea
than
to
the
states
in
between.
so,
this
is
not
unusual
and
congress
certainly
made
that
a
possibility.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
it
would
go
all
the
way
to
cat
island,
the
line
that
shown
as
a
three-mile
territorial
sea.
the
court
would
have
to
reject
the
master's
recommendation
as
to
the
boundary
before
mississippi
would
even
get
the
three
miles
from
its
mainland.
in
other
words,
if
the
master's
report
were
accepted,
all
of
that
line
which
has
mississippi
x,
all
of
that
line
over
to
the
pass
between
cat
island
and
isle
of
petit,
north
to
the
barrier
islands
and
the
lines
connecting
those
would
be
questioned.
the
question
is
whether
it
would
be
inland
waters
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
whether
it
would
be
high
seas,
whether
it
would
be
territorial
seas
of
mississippi
partially
or
whether
it
would
be
partially
territorial
seas
of
louisiana.
it
would
create
a
jurisdictional
nightmare.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
time
i
have
left
for
response.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
address
justice
o'connor's
question
about
whether
two
islands
on
the
map,
northern
tip
of
chandeleur's.
the
point
at
which
the
united
states
line
stop
is
not
a
land
--
not
a
point
on
land,
it's
a
point
out
in
the
middle
of
the
water.
the
point
shown
for
line
six
where
mississippi's
line
ends
is
the
northern
most
of
the
chandeleur
islands
is
at
land
of
a
point
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
thought
that
that
was
more
appropriate
line.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
when
i
personally
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
i
presume
that
some
time
about
the
time
that
the
decree
was
entered
in
1975.
i
have
no
knowledge
that
mississippi
was
aware
of
it
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
this
case
was
filed
in
1979.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--
it's
true.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
initially
the
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
oh,
i
think
that's
probably
giving
us
more
credit
than
we
deserve.
i
don't
think
anybody
recognize
that
or
they
certainly
wouldn't
have
drafted
the
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--
motion
that
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--
quite
and
wants
to
have
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
that's
correct
your
honor.
once
that
error
was
discovered
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
the
--
the
question
there
as
to
where
the
line
should
be
and
that
it
should
go
along
with
the
--
the
islands
or
should
it
be
a
closing
line
for
all
chandeleur
sound,
that
issue
was
presented
to
the
master.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
no,
your
honor.
this
was
presented
to
the
master
prior
to
his
original
recommendation.
this
was
presented
to
him
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--
in
a
brief
form
back
in
1983.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
it
would
have
been
in
the
early
part
of
1983,
the
master
makes
note
of
--
of
the
fact
that
we
did
raise
that
issue
as
to
the
status
of
chandeleur
sound
as
well
in
one
of
his
footnotes.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
in
this
--
this
report,
i
believe,
it's
on
page
24.
in
his
footnote,
he
indicates
that
mississippi
did
raise
that
question.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
well,
not
at
the
time
that
you
referred
the
matter
to
him
originally,
that's
correct.
there
has
been
no
remand
in
this
case
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--
except
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
--
for
submission
of
the
--
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
that's
correct,
your
honor.
so
far
as
the
lateral
boundary
with
louisiana,
i
might
point
out
that
boundary
has
not
been
fixed
or
established
beyond
the
point
at
which
this
court's
decree
ended
in
1906.
so,
there
is
a
question
as
to
the
fact
of
where
that
would
be
located.
with
respect
to
how
long
it
would
take
this
case,
mr.
minear
notes
that
it
--
he
would
expect
five
years,
i
think
that
would
very
a
lengthy
period
of
time
in
view
of
the
documentation
and
review
of
the
case
authorities
which
we
have
to
support
a
case
before
the
master.
once
the
case
was
presented
after
some
preliminary
negotiations,
it
took
approximately
10
months
to
get
the
case
ready
for
submission
to
the
master.
and
i
think
on
a
remand
that
we
could
probably
wrap
this
case
up
in
a
year's
time.
i
do
not
anticipate
it
would
take
longer
than
that.
the
master
is
intimately
familiar
with
the
geography
of
the
area
that
has
been
involved
in
this
sort
of
cases
or
mr.
minear's
says
20
years,
he
has
written
reports
before
and
i
think
that
he
could
very
well
handle
this
matter
without
unnecessary
delay.
i
think
if
we
have
a
new
master,
the
new
master
would
have
the
problem
of
having
to
become
familiar,
perhaps
a
whole
new
area
of
law
which
he
might
not
have
been
familiar
with
before.
i
think
that
is
one
the
real
advantages
of
remand.
mr.
jim
r.
bruce
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
they're
asking
that
the
master
be
affirmed
and
in
that
respect,
i
do
not
understand
if
it's
still
open.
they're
have
been
negotiations
back
and
forth
with
the
united
states
and
we
have
been
unable
to
reach
any
kind
of
agreement
about
one
point
we
thought
we
have.
