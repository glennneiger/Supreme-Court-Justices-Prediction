justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bruce,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
map
to
--
as
i
understand
that
the
lines
--
the
mark
three
from
petit
bois
to
east
ship
island
that's
not
in
dispute,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
about
the
lines
mark
seven
from
west
ship
island
down
to
the
isle
of
petit?
are
they
in
--
that's
what
the
master
proposed
in
your
dispute,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
--
and
from
that
point,
how
do
you
get
from
there
to
isle
of
petit
or
how
do
you
get
from
--
what
do
you
think
the
master
should
have
done?
i
understand
that
line
six
is
the
one
you
contend
for,
but
that
doesn't
calls
anything
if
you
just
go
down
there.
where
--
where
would
you
go
to
the
west
from
that
line
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
but
then
what
do
you
do
once
you
get
to
the
eastern
tip
of
chandeleur
island?
you
don't
claim
of
all
of
chandeleur's
island,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
asking
you,
where
do
you
go
from
there
under
your
view
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
would
then
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
contend
that
--
that
all
of
chandeleur
sound
that
shown
on
this
map
is
part
of
mississippi?
justice
john
paul
stevens
another
north
of
the
line
of
number
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
still
the
question,
how
do
you
get
from
the
northern
tip
of
chandeleur
islands
to
the
line
number
five?
i
still
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
--
i
have
not
been
able
to
understand.
i
understand,
you
think
the
line
should
begin
at
petit
bois
island,
go
to
east
ship
island,
go
south
to
the
northern
tip
of
chandeleur
islands.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then,
where
does
it
go?
justice
john
paul
stevens
get
down
to
the
south
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
down
to
the
south
tip
of
chandeleur
islands.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
what's
in
dispute
then
is
the
area
to
the
west
of
line
six
and
north
of
line
five
and
one
and
south
of
cat
island
and
west
ship
island.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
--
that
area
is
in
dispute.
now,
do
you
think
the
master
has
decided
what
state
that
--
that
water
is
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
has
--
do
you
think
he
has
decided
it's
not
in
it
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
he
has
to
set
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
the
--
the
border
should
be
lined
--
you
know
what
he's
--
what
he's
drawn.
you
don't
think
it's
open
to
you
to
re-litigate
in
a
new
proceeding
of
what
the
status
of
that
water
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
long
finger
of
water
that
you
contend
is
land.
isn't
that
all
water?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
another
question,
if
i
may
because
finally
getting
this.
you
did
argue
in
the
--
before
the
master,
and
that's
referred
to,
i
think,
at
footnote
15,
isn't
that
the
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
this
particular
area
should
have
been
part
of
your
state,
mississippi.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
master
rejected
that
and
you
did
not
file
an
exception
to
that
holding
of
the
master
and
we
affirmed
--
we
--
and
so,
isn't
the
law
of
the
case
that
you
are
not
entitled
to
this
because
it
was
raised
and
was
rejected
before
the
master
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
a
prior
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question
with
the
map
because
i'm
intrigued
by
this.
the
louisiana
boundary
is
one
and
five
and
then
it
goes
down
to
what
was
--
at
one
time,
in
the
northern
tip
of
the
chandeleur
islands,
which
i
guess
have
actually
been
moved
a
little
bit
to
the
east,
point
four.
what
possible
--
and
that
would
suggest
to
me
that
the
inland
waters,
the
boundary
of
the
inland
waters
are
between,
under
that
view
of
the
case,
from
west
ship
island
to
the
northern
tip
or
the
former
northern
tip
of
chandeleur
islands.
what
is
the
possible
justification
for
claiming
the
area
between
points
five
and
six
or
the
lines
five
and
six?
justice
stevens
no,
no.
why
would
that
be
--
that's
greater
than
the
inland
waters
as
define
in
the
louisiana
--
in
the
louisiana
border
--
boundary,
is
it
not?
what
is
the
eastern
term
--
what
is
the
--
isn't
the
--
is
it
not
true
that
the
louisiana
boundary
goes
line
one,
line
five
to
the
intersection
with
the
line
descending
from
west
ship
island?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
why
would
one
treat
anything
east
of
west
ship
island
and
that
northern
point
of
chandeleur
islands
as
inland
waters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
couple
of
questions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
first
of
all,
if
we
were
to
affirm
outright
just
the
master's
report
and
overrule
the
exceptions,
would
not
the
united
states
be
in
a
position
to
argue
that
the
boundary
has
been
fixed
in
this
proceeding
and
is
no
longer
open
to
litigate
the
status
of
the
water
area
immediately
south
of
the
line
between
cat
island
and
west
ship
island?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
not
true
that
there
has
not
yet
been
a
judicial
determination
as
to
whether
chandeleur
sound
is
or
is
not
inland
waters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
is
it
not
also
true
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
if
we
knew
all
the
answers
to
these
questions,
that
they
(a)
it
is
inland
waters
and
(b)
if
it
is,
the
line
really
would
be
incorrect
if
we
simply
affirm
because
if
it's
inland
waters,
mississippi
presumably
is
entitled
to
portion
north
of
the
louisiana
border,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
that's
right,
i
mean
i
just
saying
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
maybe
they
goofed
up
procedurally
and
they
may
have
to
--
to
standby
what
they
alleged.you
maybe
dead
right
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
asking
you,
is
it
not
a
possible
concept.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me,
it
is
not
at
all
impossible
that
one
would
conclude
that
chandeleur
sound
is
not
inland
waters,
it's
not
an
open
and
shut
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
were
true,
they
wouldn't
get
anything
more
and
louisiana
might
end
up
with
at
least
a
doubtful
claim,
as
the
one
that
you're
talking
about
their
boundary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
--
is
it
factor
also
that
if
this
proceeding
is
expanded,
louisiana
would
have
a
rather
large
stake
in
it,
i
take
it.
would
they
--
would
they
want
to
get
on
the
--
the
fund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
maybe
(inaudible)
don't
want
to
bring
a
newcomer
in
this
problem
either.
justice
stevens
nothing
further
to
say.
justice
stevens
how
do
we
get
in
this
mess?
