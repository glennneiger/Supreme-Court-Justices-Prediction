justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
this
proceeding,
when
did
the
state
first
raised
the
chandeleur
sound
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
they
are
entitled
to
three
miles
beyond
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
no
dispute
of
the
right
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
what
if
they
are
right
at
the
bottom
that
chandeleur
sound
is
also
inland
water.
now,
if
that
position
is
ultimately
correct,
what
does
that
do
to
the
line
up
there
around
the
mississippi-louisiana
line?
it
gets
very
peculiar.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sound.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
what
happens?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
--
the
first
map?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
lines
five
and
six
diverged
there.
are
there
two
different
little
islands
there?
is
that
the
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it
be
more
efficient
to
go
ahead
and
remand
now
and
let
the
thing
be
resolved?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--
shown
on
the
map
what
they
want.
why
are
we
in
doubt?
they've
made
a
claim.
you
can
see
the
lines
right
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
yes,
but
i
heard
mr.
bruce
say
this
afternoon
what
they
asked
for
is
a
remand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
i
were
as
a
member
of
this
court
concerned
about
that
and
wanted
to
protect
their
right
to
proceed,
what
is
the
best
way
to
do
it
to
make
clear
to
the
master
that
the
line
isn't
final
for
that
purpose
or
to
go
ahead
and
remand
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
seemed
easier
to
me
frankly
either
to
remand
it
or
to
say
the
line
isn't
final.
