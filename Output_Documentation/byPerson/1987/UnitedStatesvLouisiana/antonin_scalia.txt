coastline?
but
that's

that
--
justice
scalia
well,
what
he's
asking
is
where
is
mississippi's
coastline?
i
think
what
--
what
you
would
do
is
you
would
head
west
from
the
point
where
line
six
intersects
with
the
dotted
line
five.
isn't
that
where
you
think
the
boundary
of
mississippi
is?
justice
scalia

i
think
--
i
think
justice
blackmun
is
asking,
if
you
lost
on
that
point
here,
not
if
you
lost
after
it
was
referred
back
to
the
master.
if
we
choose
not
to
refer
it
back
to
the
master,
you
can
bring
another
original
action,
can't
you?
justice

offer
to

still
open?
