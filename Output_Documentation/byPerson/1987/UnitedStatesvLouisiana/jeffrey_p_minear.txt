mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
urges
that
this
court
reject
mississippi's
exceptions
and
approved
the
special
master's
report.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
stating
the
procedural
context
to
this
present
case.
alabama
and
mississippi
commenced
this
proceeding
in
1979
to
define
the
state's
coastline
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mississippi
specifically
alleged,
“the
chain
of
islands
extending
from
petit
bois
island
to
cat
island,
informing
the
southern
most
boundary
of
the
state
of
mississippi
does
in
fact
constitute
the
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters
and
is
the
coastline
of
mississippi
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.”
this
appears
at
page
3
of
the
motion,
paragraph
12.
that
statement
defined
what
this
case
was
all
about
and
if
that
wasn't
not
enough,
there
are
number
of
other
statements
that
mississippi
has
made
along
the
way.
in
the
motion
supporting
or
the
memorandum
supporting
that
motion
at
page
29,
they
said,
“therefore,
we
submit
that
the
barrier
islands
enclosing
the
mississippi
sound
represents
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act
and
mississippi
is
entitled
to
have
this
court
designate
its
coastline
is
extending
from
the
line
of
ordinary
low
watermark
on
the
seaward
side
of
such
islands,
a
distance
of
three
geographic
miles
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.”
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
we
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
fact
the
master's
1984
report
was
quite
clear
on
this.
“the
sole
issue
raised
by
these
motions
is
whether
the
coastlines
of
mississippi
and
alabama
are
the
line
of
ordinary
low
watermark
along
the
southern
mainland
and
along
certain
islands
adjacent
thereto
or
whether
the
waters
of
mississippi
sound
are
inland
waters
and
those
coastlines
are
therefore
the
line
of
ordinary
low
water
along
with
the
southern
shore
of
those
islands
together
with
the
line
mark
and
the
seaward
limit
of
those
waters.”
that
appears
at
page
two
of
the
special
master's
report.
this
court
noticed
this
same
point
as
well
in
its
opinion
at
page
470
u.s.
96,
“the
two
states,
alabama
and
mississippi
contend
that
the
whole
of
mississippi
sound
constitutes
inland
waters.
under
this
view,
the
coastline
of
the
states
consisted
the
lines
of
ordinary
low
water
along
the
southern
coast
of
the
barrier
islands.”
that
was
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
right,
your
honor.
and
there
is
no
dispute
the
--
the
master's
report
seems
to
have
misused
the
word
“boundary
for
coastline”
in
it's
--
in
it's
conclusion.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
and
we
submitted
that
it
is
what
this
--
this
case
is
all
about.
now,
the
master
we
have
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
no.
we
would
submit,
united
states
submits,
if
there
was
a
determination
that
chandeleur
island
is
inland
water
and
we
further
submit
there
has
been
no
such
determination.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
chandeleur
sound,
excuse
me,
is
inland
water.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
the
proper
line,
we
would
submit
would
be
the
line
indicated
in
the
alaska
map,
line
five.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
this
would
be
the
first
map
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--
of
alaska.
and
this
line,
which
we
have
offered
as
a
settlement
of
this
case
would
in
fact
can
ensure
a
continuous
coastline
between
mississippi
and
louisiana
would
simply
be
an
extension
of
the
stipulation
that
we
made
with
the
state
of
louisiana
in
1974.
i
should
note
that
in
that
stipulation,
we
were
absolutely
clear
that
we
were
not
conceding
that
chandeleur
sound
was
inland
water,
and
this
court
noted
that
that
concession
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
what?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
what
our
stipulation
said
and
this
appears
in
the
special
master's
1970
report
at
a(2),
is
that
we
would
stipulate
that
louisiana
would
be
entitled
to
use
chandeleur
or
would
be
--
it's
rights
under
the
submerged
lands
act
would
be
recognized
in
chandeleur
sound
without
an
admission
on
our
part
that
these
are
inland
waters
for
international
purposes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
louisiana
limits
in
these
cases.
it
would
have
been
or
was,
in
fact,
an
extension
of
the
line
that
marks
the
mississippi-louisiana
boundary
to
line
five
which
then
extends
southerly
to
the
northern
tip
of
chandeleur
island.
so,
in
fact,
what
we
have
offered
to
mississippi
in
which
they
have
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
your
honor.
actually,
the
difference
here,
there's
been
some
movement
of
the
entire
chain
of
islands
as
a
result
of
simply
accretions
and
reelections.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
we
have
--
we
have
agreed
to
recognize.
this
is
the
lateral
boundary
between
mississippi
and
louisiana.
and
as
a
far
as
any
--
we
don't
believe
there's
any
dispute
between
mississippi
and
louisiana
to
the
extension
of
that
line.
but
whatever
that
line
might
be
extended,
we
would
then
say
that
the
line
demarking
the
rights
of
mississippi
and
louisiana
would
be
line
five
to
west
ship
island.
now,
this
has
already
been
agreed
to
on
the
portion
below
the
lateral
boundary
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--
southerly
lateral
boundary.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
not
as
inland
water.
only
when
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--
to
recognize.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
exactly
the
relief
that
they
request.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
for
the
reason
that
as
you
know
the
original
actions
proceeded
snail's
pace
and
it's
very
important
the
outset
to
define
what
the
purpose
of
the
original
action
is.
now,
if
we
simply
remand
here,
we
might
be
remanding
for
another
five
years
of
litigation.
i
think
it's
important
for
mississippi
to
file
a
motion
for
leave
for
further
supplemental
decree
in
this
case
to
specify
exactly
what
their
claims
are
and
what
their
theories
are,
so
this
court
can
make
the
appropriate
reference.
mississippi's
position
as
you
can
tell
has
been
moving
throughout
this
litigation.
i
think
it's
important
for
them
to
specify
to
this
court
exactly
what
relief
they're
asking.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
this
court
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
part
of
the
question
here,
two
are
the
theories
that
they
are
raising.
now,
they're
also
claiming
that
this
is
all
--
let
me
step
back
for
just
a
second
to
answer
your
question,
your
honor.
the
actual
exceptions
that
mississippi
has
filed
here
is
not
asked
for
a
remand
to
determine
the
status
of
chandeleur
sound.
they
have
asked
for
an
order
from
this
court
declaring
that
chandeleur
sound
is
inland
waters
and
directing
the
master
to
draw
that
--
the
appropriate
line.
now,
that
matter
still
remains
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor,
but
we
have
--
this
is
not
what
they
requested
when
they
filed
their
brief
and
we
filed
our
brief
in
response.
i
think
that
we
are
entitled,
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
submit
a
response
if
they
wish
to
further
proceeding
to
make
clear
exactly
what
would
be
litigated
here
and
then
what
theories.
now,
some
of
the
theories
that
they
have
advanced
have
in
fact
already
been
rejected
by
the
special
master.
the
question
of
straight
baselines,
everything
that
was
to
be
said
about
straight
baselines
was
said
by
louisiana
in
the
1974
proceeding.
the
special
master
rejected
all
those
arguments,
and
this
court
affirmed
the
special
master's
report.
so,
i
think
it's
important
that
in
--
any
further
litigation
in
this
case
that
we
be
clear
about
exactly
what
our
theories
are
and
where
we
are
going
from
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i
am
afraid
i
don't
understand
your
question
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
as
a
far
as
that
concession
goes,
i'm
sure
that
louisiana
would
want
--
louisiana
would
want
to
hold
us
to
the
practical
effect
of
the
stipulation
we
entered
into
with
them.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
the
united
states
would
be
in
a
position
to
make
that
argument.
the
solicitor
general
has
not
made
a
determination
whether
he
would
make
the
argument.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
if
there's
a
problem
in
that
regard
extends
from
mississippi's
original
allegation
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
would,
yes,
under
those
conditions.
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
possibility.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
this
court
should
do
is
simply
accept
the
special
master's
report
and
tell
him
to
go
forward
and
draw
the
line.
mississippi
will
then
have
several
options.
one,
it
can
ask
for
relief
prior
to
the
formulation
of
the
decree
to
this
court
specifying
exactly
what
it
--
what
--
asking
for
an
expansion
of
the
reference
to
special
master.
if
it
does
not
wish
to
do
that
and
wait
until
the
decree
is
entered,
we
can
a
file
a
motion
for
entry
of
an
additional
supplemental
decree.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
problem
again,
your
honor,
with
a
remand
is
that
we
will
be
giving
the
master,
we'll
have
true
lack
of
direction
in
terms
of
the
reference.
normally,
a
case
is
referred
to
the
master
based
on
the
submission
of
the
party.
in
this
case,
it
was
the
motion
by
mississippi
for
further
--
for
the
entry
of
a
supplemental
decree.
they
stated
what
their
position
was
and
they
certainly
had
plenty
of
time
to
determine
what
their
position
might
be.
mississippi
became
a
state
in
1817.
it's
a
160
years
there
in
which
they
could
make
some
conclusions
about
what
their
southern
boundary
is.
in
addition,
they
had
five
years
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
master's
or
the
preparation
the
master's
special
report.
if
there
are
difficulties
here
from
mississippi,
there
are
primarily
difficulties
of
their
own
making.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
except
here,
mississippi
is
moved
--
would
need
to
move
to
amend
their
complaint
after
they
won
the
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
that's
exactly
the
situation
we
face
around
here.
in
some,
the
court
should
approve
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm
sure
that
they
would
be
interested
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--
in
participating
at
least
this
amicus
in
this
case.
they
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm
sure
that
is
the
case
as
well,
your
honor.
so
as
you
can
see
as
your
questions
indicate
that
if
there's
a
further
remand
here,
we're
talking
about
an
extensive
further
litigation
and
without
any
clear
guidance
as
what
the
absolute
scope
of
that
litigation
might
be.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
the
actual
litigation
for
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
this
master's
has
been
approaching
20
years,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
have
--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
might
well
be
that
the
special
master
has
--
willing
--
is
quite
willing
to
be
absolved
from
his
responsibilities
in
this
case.
i
simply
do
not
know.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
unless
you
have
some
further
questions.
