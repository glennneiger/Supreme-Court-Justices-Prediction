we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
9
original,
united
states
against
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
bruce,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bruce,
i
take
it
from
the
way
you're
pronouncing
the
word
that
louisiana's
pronounced
it
chandeleur
sound
even
though
the
last
syllable
is
spelled
l-e-u-r.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
between
cat
island
and
isle
of
petit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
question
squarely
involved
in
that
case?
you
know,
a
court
will
write
an
opinion
and
it
would
be
focusing
on
one
point,
and
it
may
--
may
say
(inaudible)
to
get
from
here
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
without
really
thinking
it
saying
anything
other
than
kind
of
descriptive
language
about
where
did
the
gulf
of
mexico
starts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bruce,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
if
i
may
about
the
map
which
i
think
is
--
yes,
it's
the
one
in
alaska's
amicus
brief.
it
seems
odd
in
a
way
that
we
should
be
relying
on
a
map
which
is
found
only
in
the
amicus
brief,
but
to
--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
take
--
take
a
look
at
where
it
shows
chandeleur
sound.
and
then
on
the
left,
all
that
land,
is
that
mainland
louisiana?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
justice
stevens
asked
you
about
a
line
that
comes
down
to
six,
goes
down
from
east
ship
island
to
the
northern
most
of
the
chandeleur
islands,
and
then,
where
does
the
line
goes,
it
goes
westward
from
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
about
the
southern
part
of
chandeleur
sound,
is
that
all
mississippi?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bruce.
we'll
here
now
from
you,
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
--
you're
saying,
mr.
minear
that
the
government
has
offered
to
agree
that
the
mississippi
boundary
would
be
a
line
running
from
point
one
to
point
two
on
figure
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
his
son
maybe?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
bruce,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
bruce.
the
case
is
submitted.
