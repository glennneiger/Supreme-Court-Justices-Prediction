mr.
murray
gartner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
union
security
provisions,
which
is
another
way
of
saying
compulsory
payment
of
union
dues.
it
is
also
here,
as
was
the
last
case,
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit.
for
more
than
a
year
now,
because
of
the
decision
of
that
court,
thousands
of
flight
attendants
employed
by
twa
have
contributed
more
than
$2.5
million
to
the
treasury
of
the
union,
against
their
will,
and
under
threat
by
twa
that
if
they
did
not
do
so,
they
would
lose
their
jobs.
the
court
below
held
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act
for
twa
to
do
otherwise,
because
it
said
the
union
has
an
agreement
with
twa
pursuant
to
section
211
of
the
railway
labor
act,
which
requires
twa
to
make
those
threats
and
which
requires
those
flight
attendants
to
pay
those
dues.
the
agreement
to
which
the
court
and
the
union
point,
however,
was
part
of
a
contract
effective
by
its
terms
only
from
august
1,
1981
to
july
31,
1984.
from
1984
to
1986,
twa
and
the
respondent
union,
which
i
will
refer
to
as
iffa>
["],
were
engaged
in
negotiation
and
mediation
under
the
auspices
of
the
national
mediation
board,
in
an
attempt
to
reach
a
successor
agreement.
those
efforts
were
unsuccessful.
no
successor
agreement
was
made.
no
successor
agreement
is
in
effect
now.
mr.
murray
gartner
all
issues
that
were
on
the
table
in
the
sense
that
the
entire
agreement
was
on
the
table.
there
were
a
great
many
issues.
mr.
murray
gartner
the
only
bargaining
which
is
going
on,
mr.
justice
white,
is
in
attempt
to
reach
an
agreement.
whenever
the
union
wants
to
resume
negotiations--
mr.
murray
gartner
--no,
it
does
not
challenge
it,
because
under
the
statute,
really,
it
has
no
right
to
challenge
it.
there
is
no
procedure
under
the
railway
labor
act
which
would
allow
twa
to
initiate
a
decertification
process.
mr.
murray
gartner
as
your
honor
knows,
there
is
no
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
murray
gartner
but
the
equivalent.
there
really
isn't
a
good
answer
to
that
question,
justice
white,
because
there
is
no
comparable
procedure
under
the
railway
labor
act,
as
there
is
under
the
nlra.
mr.
murray
gartner
that
is
almost
true.
and
the
national
mediation
board
does
not
have
a
good
procedure
for
decertification,
certainly
not
by
the
employer,
and
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
employee.
mr.
murray
gartner
despite
the
fact
that
there
is
no
successor
agreement,
the
court
below
held
that
the
union
security
provisions
of
the
old
agreement
continue
in
effect
because
parts
of
the
prior
agreement
survive,
as
the
district
court
described
it,
and
i
quote:
"as
a
mutilated
collective
bargaining
agreement.
"
that,
as
your
honors
know,
is
not
a
term
known
to
the
statute
or
to
the
art.
the
court
below
said
very
little
about
section
211,
or
the
words
of
this
court,
in
the
street
case,
about
the
limited
inroads
which
that
section
permits,
by
agreement
of
the
union
and
the
carrier,
on
the
complete
prohibition
of
compulsory
dues
payment
otherwise
mandated
by
sections
2
fourth
and
2
fifth.
ignoring
that
statutory
provision,
the
eighth
circuit
justified
the
exaction
of
dues
from
non-member,
permanent
replacements
and
crossovers...
that
is,
people
who
went
to
work
during
the
strike
and
crossed
the
picket
line...
during
the
strike
and
the
continuing
self-help
period
in
which
we
are
now,
by
characterizing
the
union
security
simply
as
an
extremely
important
condition
of
employment,
without
regard
to
what
the
statute
required
in
order
to
have
that
as
a
condition
of
employment.
mr.
murray
gartner
not
under
the
terms
of
the
contract,
justice
white.
the
court
below
was
driven
by
its
conception
of
what
the
act
required
in
what
it
said
was
its
interpretation
of
the
contract.
but
because
of
what
it
believed
that
the
railway
labor
act
required,
in
terms
of
bargaining
about
each
single
provision,
it
construed
a
duration
clause
which
on
its
face
was
completely
unambiguous
and
which
provided
for
the
non-renewal
of
the
entire
agreement,
as
though
it
provided
for
partial
renewal
of
the
agreement.
so
that
the
court
was
not
construing
the
contract.
it
was
simply
using
the
railway
labor
act
to
change
the
words
and
the
meaning
of
the
contract.
mr.
murray
gartner
that
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
and
that
is
what
we
relied
upon.
mr.
murray
gartner
i
do
not
think
that
question
is
before
the
court
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
gartner
because
the
union
security
clause
is
the
specific
subject
of
a
specific
provision
of
the
statute
which
requires
an
agreement.
it
was
enacted
in
complete
accord
with
and
adoption
of
similar
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
have
been
uniformly
interpreted
to
require
that
union
security
provisions
and
on
the
expiration
of
the
contract,
regardless
of
whether
all
the
other
provisions
of
an
nlra
contract
continue
in
existence.
now,
before
the
decision
below,
the
first,
second,
seventh
and
ninth
circuits
had
recognized
that
agreements
under
the
railway
labor
act
may
expire
in
accordance
with
their
terms,
but
that
because
of
section
6,
the
conditions
established
by
those
agreements
nevertheless
continue
during
the
status
quo
period
during
which
negotiations
are
carried
on
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
reach
a
new
agreement.
with
specific
relevance
to
the
question
in
this
case,
the
second
circuit,
in
the
manning
case,
held
that
a
dues
checkoff
agreement
may
expire
in
accordance
with
its
agreed
termination
date,
but
is
then
continued
for
the
limited
status
quo
period,
even
though
the
carrier
had
not
proposed
to
change
it
but
merely
to
let
it
expire.
the
proposal
of
the
union
in
that
case
to
include
a
dues
checkoff
provision
in
the
new
agreement
would
not
seem
any
different
from
what
the
parties
here
intended.
both
parties
intended
to
have
a
union
security
clause
in
a
new
agreement,
but
not
to
have
a
free-floating
union
security
clause
without
an
agreement.
no
court
of
appeals,
until
the
court
below,
has
held
that
after
a
contract
expires
and
after
the
conditions
it
established
continue
in
existence,
for,
in
the
words
of
this
court,
the
almost
interminable
status
quo
period,
as
the
court
said
in
detroit
and
toledo.
and
no
new
agreement
is
reached
that
parts
of
the
old
agreement
continue
further
into
the
self
help
period.
even
under
the
nlra,
as
i
have
indicated,
justice
white--
mr.
murray
gartner
--i
agree,
justice
scalia,
it
is
not
before
you.
the
only
reason
i
am
mentioning
it
is
that
respondent
has
spent
to
much
time
trying
to
persuade
the
court
that
it
is
before
you
and
only
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
even
under
the
nlra,
where
there
is
some
provision
about
continuing
bargaining
about
other
provisions,
the
very
union
security
provisions
which
was
adopted
in
the
rla
by
the
model
of
he
nlra,
is
held
to
expire.
so
i
will
not
pay
any
more
attention
to
that
question.
mr.
murray
gartner
no,
justice
stevens.
i
think
it
is
very
clear
in
both
opinions
that
the
only
reason
that
they
reached
the
decision
that
they
did
is
that
they
believed
that
the
statute
required
there
to
be
contracts
in
the
railway
labor
act
coverage
which
were
interminable
and
did
not
have
any
termination
date.
this
contract
had
a
termination
date.
mr.
murray
gartner
if
your
honor
is
referring,
as
i
believe
you
are,
to
the
eight
circuit's
decision--
mr.
murray
gartner
--page
4(a).
mr.
murray
gartner
but
on
page
5,
they
say,
we
construe
the
terms
of
the
duration
clause
of
this
agreement
in
light
of
the
national
labor
policy
enunciated
by
the
railway
labor
act,
which
governs
airlines
as
well
as
railroads,
and
in
light
of
pertinent
decisions
bearing
on
the
issues.
and
then
they
go
into
a
long
discussion
about
the
purposes
of
the
railway
labor
ac
and
the
florida
east
coast
case
which
dealt
with
an
existing
agreement,
no
with
an
agreement
which
had
a
termination
date
or
which
purported
to
have
a
limited
effective
term.
and
they
construe,
as
they
say,
they
purport
to
be
construing
the
language
of
the
contract,
but
they
are
not
construing
the
language,
they
are
saying
that
the
railway
labor
act
requires
this
result;
and
in
effect
what
they
are
saying
is,
whatever
the
parties
said,
the
railway
labor
act
says
that
you
can't
do
it
that
way,
so
we
are
going
to
pretend
that
they
did
it
another
way.
mr.
murray
gartner
justice
stevens,
i
think
this
is
an
important
point
and
i
would
like
to
dwell
on
it
for
a
minute
or
two.
every
other
court
which
has
construed
a
similar
contract,
which
has
construed
the
contract,
without
the
baggage
of
its
interpretation
of
the
railway
labor
act,
have
held
that
this
kind
of
a
contract
provides
for
the
non-renewal
and
the
termination
of
the
agreement.
so
the
only
way
that
the
eight
circuit
reads
the
contrary
result...
and
they
said
specifically,
we
will
not
follow
the
rationale
of
reeve
aleutian.
the
practical
effect
of
the
court's
decision
offends
all
reason.
what
the
court
has
done
is
to
say
that
after
an
agree
contract
term
has
ended,
if
a
union
insists
upon
striking
to
attain
its
new
contract
objectives,
and
the
employer
decides
to
maintain
its
operations
by
recruiting
and
employing
permanent
replacements,
the
employer
must
induce
the
replacements
to
come
through
the
union's
picket
line
to
work
in
order
to
defeat
the
strike,
and
in
the
same
breath,
tell
those
permanent
replacements
and
crossovers
that
they
must
pay
initiation
fees
to
the
union...
not
only
dues,
but
initiation
fees...
to
the
same
union
which
is
conducting
the
picket
line
so
that
the
union
will
have
the
funds
to
continue
the
strike.
that
is
the
effect
of
the
court's
decision.
in
the
many
cases
in
which
this
court
has
defined
the
scope
of
section
211,
and
parallel
provisions
of
the
nlra,
it
has
never
suggested
that
without
a
current
agreement,
and
in
the
self-help
period,
211
permits
such
a
requirement.
nor
do
i
think
it
needs
much
argument
to
establish
that
if
the
unions
had
asked
congress
to
pass
a
law
in
those
words
to
achieve
that
objective,
that
they
could
have
attracted
much
support.
our
submission
to
this
court
is
that
congress
did
not
pass
such
a
law
with
respect
to
union
security
clauses,
that
this
court
has
not
interpreted
union
security
clauses,
particularly
under
the
railway
labor
act,
to
have
that
meaning.
mr.
murray
gartner
yes.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
murray
gartner
at
least
this
provision
terminated.
this
provision
terminated.
mr.
murray
gartner
i
tend
to
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
this
court
has
said,
in
hanson,
in
street,
in
allen,
and
ellis,
that
there
is
a
very
limited
function
and
authority
granted
by
section
211,
and
that
that
function
is
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
free
riders.
mr.
murray
gartner
no,
justice
scalia.
i
think
in
the
airline
industry,
many
contracts
are.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
amici
in
their
brief
say
on
page
25,
i
believe
it
is,
that
this
contract,
this
twa
contract,
is
typical
of
contracts
in
the
airline
industry.
in
the
railroad
industry,
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
murray
gartner
i
do
not
think,
your
honor,
that
this
court
is
bound
to
say
that.
this
court
has
never
addressed
that
question
as
to
whether
in
those
other
situations
the
permission
granted
by
section
211
allows
unions
and
employers
to
threaten
permanent
replacements
and
crossovers
with
a
loss
of
their
jobs
if
they
don't
pay
money
to
support
the
strike.
this
court
has
never
made
that
decision.
and
i
think
that
it
is
an
open
question.
but
it
is
not
a
question
that
we
have
to
deal
with
in
this
case
because
we
fortunately
did
have
a
contract
which
had
a
termination
date.
the
respondent
prefers
not
to
talk
about
section
211
or
to
acknowledge
that
it
is
a
limited
exception
to
the
otherwise
complete
prohibition
of
compulsory
dues
requirements
in
the
act.
instead,
it
has
directed
the
court's
attention
to
section
2
seventh.
and
with
respect
to
section
2
seventh,
i
would
only
think
it
necessary
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
what
the
court
itself
said
in
detroit
and
toledo,
that
2
seventh
is
not
a
status
quo
provision
which
has
anything
to
do
with
a
major
dispute
procedure.
all
that
section
2
seventh
does
is
to
provide
for
the
enforcement
of
existing
agreements
and
then
to
call
section
6
into
play.
well,
section
6
was
called
into
play
in
this
situation.
it
was
in
play
for
two
years.
twa
complied
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
section
2
seventh
and
section
6
and
those
sections
have
no
further
application
in
this
case.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
murray
gartner
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
you
may
not
pay
more
than
you
have
offered
during
the
negotiations
because
that
would
be
denigrating
to
the
union.
whether
you
may
pay
less
is
i
think
a
question
to
which
justice
douglas
addressed
himself
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case.
mr.
murray
gartner
that
is
a
statutory
obligation.
mr.
murray
gartner
that
is
our
view,
yes,
justice
stevens.
that
is
the
view
that
the
ninth
circuit
holds.
that
is
the
view
that
the
second
circuit
has
expressed.
mr.
murray
gartner
no,
i
haven't
taken
a
different
position.
i
think
what
i've
said
is
that
there
may
be
some
need
to
discuss
that
question
in
a
different
case,
but
not
in
this
case.
but
you
are
asking
me
for
our
view.
mr.
murray
gartner
it
is
not
an
issue
before
this
court,
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
twa
made
any
other
changes
other
than
the
ones
that
it
had
specifically
proposed.
mr.
murray
gartner
yes.
mr.
murray
gartner
yes.
that
is
right.
and
i
would
add
that
the
reason
that
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
comparable
impasse
procedure
under
the
rla
as
there
is
under
the
nlra
is
that
the
rla
imposes
such
a
very
long
and
detailed
and
specific
bargaining
duty
and
procedure--
mr.
murray
gartner
--well,
but
then
when
you
come
to
the
end
of
that
you
are
at
an
impasse
on
the
entire
contract.
mr.
murray
gartner
thank
you.
mr.
murray
gartner
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
wish
i
had
more
time
to
respond
to
many
issues,
but
i
know
i
do
not.
one
issue
i
would
like
to
deal
with
immediately.
i
have
heard
this
and
the
court
has
seen
it
so
many
times
in
the
respondent's
brief,
that
twa
was
under
an
obligation
to
negotiate
about
and
to
deal
with
the
changes
it
intended
to
make.
twa
did
not
intend
to
make
a
change
in
the
union
security
clause
in
the
new
agreement.
and
that
is
all
that
the
railway
labor
act
requires
it
to
do.
the
railway
labor
act
says
you
shall
tell
the
other
party
for
the
purpose
of
negotiation
what
changes
you
want
in
the
new
agreement...
not
what
changes
you
want
during
the
self
help
period.
the
self
help
period
is
uncontrolled
by
the
statute
and
this
court
has
said
so
many
