justice
white
do
i
take
it
then
that
all
issues
have
been
bargained
to
impasse?
justice
white
there
is
no
more
bargaining
going
on?
justice
white
but
twa
does
not
challenge
the
fact
that
the
union
is
still
the
collective
bargaining
agent
for
its
employees?
justice
white
so
what
does
the
company
have
to
do?
just
refuse
to
bargain
and
then
be
found
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
so
once
a
bargaining
agent
is
certified,
that
is
the
end
of
it,
that
is
forever.
is
that
it?
justice
white
thank
you.
justice
white
the
court
thought
that
under
the
terms
of
the
contract,
and
under
the
railway
act,
the
agreement
would
continue
except
with
respect
to
the
changes
that
the
company
notified
the
union
about?
justice
white
is
your
first
submission
at
least
that
once
you
gave
notice
of
change
pursuant
to
the
contract
and
labor
act,
and
the
expiration
date
of
the
contract
came
about,
and
you
exhausted
all
railway
labor
act
procedures
and
you
were
in
the
self-help
phase,
the
entire
contract
is
over?
justice
white
and
thereafter
you
are
completely
free
to
change
any
condition
of
employment
without
bargaining?
justice
white
if
you
are
not
free,
if
there
are
some
provisions
you
are
not
free
to
change
without
bargaining,
how
come
you
are
free
to
change
the
union
security
clause
without
bargaining?
justice
white
mr.
gartner,
if
it
really
were
the
law
that
some
provisions
of
the
contract
survive
until
they
are,
at
least
until
you
have
bargained
to
impasse
on
them,
if
that
is
the
law,
then
you
have
the
problem
of
distinguishing
out
this
union
security
provision...
which
you
have
tried
to
do.
justice
white
so
you
really
have
two
provisions.
one,
the
whole
contract
is
over,
or
two,
even
if
it
is
not,
this
one
is.
justice
white
so
that
is
a
substitute
for
impasse
bargaining.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
that
allegation
that
you
repeated,
was
it
on
the
contract
or
statute
or
what?
justice
white
but
what
about
your
argument?
justice
white
so
even
if
there
hadn't
been
a
provision
in
the
contract,
about
any
part
of
the
contract
surviving,
the
statute
itself
would
say
yes,
everything
survives
except
what
has
been
submitted
for
change.
justice
white
what
about
the
provisions
that
have
been
submitted
for
change?
justice
white
and
if
it
is
wages,
why,
as
soon
as
the
stay
put
period
is
over,
the
employer
is
free
to
go
up
or
down
on
wages?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
but
all
the
other
provisions
remain
exactly
the
same?
justice
white
other
than
what?
justice
white
so
there
is
a
holding
right
in
your
teeth,
i
guess.
justice
white
except
in
construed
the
contract
in
light
of
the
statute.
justice
white
did
you
talk
about
it
in
your
brief?
justice
white
did
the
union
insist
on
collecting
the
agency
fee
during
the
strike?
justice
white
you
mean
like
a
proposal
that
will
only
be
operative
during
a
strike?
justice
white
was
the
united
states
a
petitioner
in
that
case?
justice
white
how
come
you
can
change
the
expiration
clause?
justice
white
so
you
are
modifying
what
the
expiration
clause
says.
justice
white
and
if
the
strike
is
over,
they
can
never
change?
justice
white
you
mean
that
is
different
than
saying
this
contract
will
expire
completely
on
a
date
certain?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
if
a
contract
does?
justice
white
so
that
the
parties
may
not
provide
for
the
expiration
of
a
contract
and
the
disappearance
of
all
obligations
of
the--
justice
white
--of
the
railroad
to
observe
any
working
conditions?
justice
white
that
is,
a
i
said
a
while
ago,
that
is
certainly
changing
a
provision
of
the
contract,
without
any
bargaining.
justice
white
well,
the
contract
says
expire,
it
is
all
over,
and
the
union
says
sorry,
but
it
isn't.
i
know
we
agreed
to
it
but
it
isn't.
justice
white
but
in
my
example,
my
example,
all
the
contract
says
is
it's
over.
justice
white
no,
it
just
says
the
contract
is
over.
justice
white
i
know
exactly
what
i
said.
justice
white
so
whether
this
is
a
contractual
decision
in
this
case
or
based
on
the
law,
it
is
open
for
de
novo
review
here.
justice
white
maybe
both
courts
may
have
agreed
with
each
other
below,
but
they
agreed
on
a
question
of
law.
justice
white
but
the
meaning
of
the
words
in
that
contract
certainly
is
not
a
question
of
fact
subject
to
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
justice
white
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
you
did.
it
was
a
dissent.
