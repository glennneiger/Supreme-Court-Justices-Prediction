mr.
steven
a.
fehr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
by
attempting
to
clarify
some
things
in
the
record.
first,
the
notion
that
this
case
was
tried
upon
a
narrow
ground
related
to
the
sole
change
of
union
security
is
untrue.
twa
filed
this
case
as
a
declaratory
judgment
asking
the
court
to
declare,
among
other
things,
that
the
contract
expired.
the
court
declared
the
opposite.
in
our
answer,
we
specifically
alleged
twice
that
twa
could
make
only
those
changes
which
it
had
submitted
to
the
statutory
procedures.
and
there
is
no
question
but
that
that
is
what
both
courts
held.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
the
district
court
held
both
under
the
statute
and
under
the
contract.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
we
believe
that
both
under
the
contract
and
under
the
statute,
either
one
or
both,
you
can
only
make
the
changes
you
submitted
to
the
process.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
think
the
only
logical
reading
of
section
6
and
section
2
seventh
is
those
provisions
which
have
been
submitted
for
change
may
be
altered
by
the
carrier
during
the
self
help
period.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
the
carrier
is
free
to
implement
the
changes
which
have
been
proposed.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
in
which
the
national
mediation
board
has
performed
its
function.
it
is
not
free
to
implement
any
change
it
wishes
at
that
time.
in
other
words,
if
it
proposed
$8.00,
it
cannot
implement
$6.00.
but
it
can
implement
$8.00.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
provisions
which
have
not
been
subject
to
the
bargaining
process
of
the
act
may
not
be
altered,
yes.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
the
court
of
appeals
said
that,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
disagree
with
that
rather
strongly,
your
honor,
and
the
district
court
did.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
they
preferred
to
express
it
as
to
what
the
parties
themselves
believed
to
be
the
effect
of
the
contract.
the
contract
says
it
renews
itself
indefinitely
without
change
unless
you
give
a
notice
of
an
intended
change.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
well,
but
it
is
somewhat
difficult.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
think
it
is
rather
unusual
to
construe
a
notice
of
a
specified
intended
change
to
be
a
signal
that
you
may
then
make
any
change
you
wish
whatsoever.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
other
than
the
reeve
court.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
other
than
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
the
reeve
case.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
but
the
other
courts
of
appeal
which
use
the
word
rla
contract
do
not
use
the
word
as
twa
would
use
it.
they
do
not
mean
expire
so
as
to
allow
the
carrier
to
implement
anything
and
everything
during
self
help.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
most
of
those
cases...
there
are
really
only
four
cases
that
deal
with
changes
a
carrier
may
make
during
self
help.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
they
mean
expire
so
as
to
get
to
the
status
quo
period,
expire
so
as
to
get
to
the
self
help
period.
there
is
no
case,
other
than
the
ninth
circuit
case,
that
says
once
you
get
to
self
help,
anything
goes,
the
carrier
can
change
anything
and
everything.
perhaps
the
best
example
of
it
is
judge
posner's
opinion
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
eeoc
v.
united
when
he
uses
the
words
"expiration
date".
but
even
as
he
uses
the
words
"expiration
date"
he
says
that
the
passing
of
the
expiration
date
does
not
allow
the
carrier
to
implement
any
changes.
it
only
allows
the
carrier
to
implement
those
which
were
the
subject
of
section
6
notice.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
he
is
saying
it
under
both.
and
so
did
the
district
court.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
pure
statutory
issue.
that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
it
did
make
comments
to
that
effect,
yes,
your
honor.
you
should
also
perhaps
look
at
how
both
courts
framed
the
issue
below.
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
the
issue
was
framed
by
both
courts
in
broad
terms
as
to
whether
the
contract
survived
both
under
the
statute
and
under
the
contract,
and
the
framing
of
the
issues
did
not
even
specifically
mention
union
security.
also
in
response
to
a
question
you
posed,
justice
white,
there
is
no
formal
decertification
procedure
under
the
national
mediation
board.
there
are
certainly
methods
in
which
a
new
union
can
be
voted
in.
in
fact,
twa's
flight
attendants
have
been
represented
by
four
different
unions
over
the
course
of
40
years.
there
is
a
rather
central
point,
a
rather
central
case
which
has
not
been
mentioned
yet
today.
and
that
is
the
decision
22
years
ago
by
this
court
in
brac
v.
fec
railway,
and
i
think
we
need
to
talk
about
that
case
a
little
bit.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
rather
extensively,
your
honor.
this
is,
i
believe,
the
case
the
court
envisioned
22
years
ago
in
fec
when
the
court
said
that
it
would
make
a
sham
of
the
bargaining
and
mediation
processes
of
the
act
if
the
carrier
could
unilaterally
achieve
what
the
act
requires
be
done
by
the
other
orderly
procedures.
and
twa
has
barely
mentioned
the
rationale
of
the
fec
court
in
its
brief,
and
with
good
reasons,
because
that
rationale
really
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
duration
clauses
in
contracts.
the
court
talks
about
the
spirit
of
the
act.
and
i
think
we
have
to
ask
and
answer
the
question
today
of
what
is
the
spirit
of
the
act
the
court
was
talking
about
in
fec.
twa
claims
that
spirit
is
that
existing
agreements
be
honored.
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
rationale
of
fec
which
talks
about
the
community
of
carrier
and
employees
which
is
only
interrupted
by
a
strike,
which
talks
about
a
reversion
to
the
jungle
if
the
carrier
may
use
the
occasion
of
a
strike
to
tear
up
the
entire
contract,
which
talks
about
a
carrier
using
a
dispute
over
limited
issues
to
make
sweeping
changes
that
the
carrier
did
not
bring
to
the
bargaining
table,
and
which
talks
about
providing
the
carrier
an
incentive
to
provoke
or
prolong
a
strike
so
that
it
may
break
the
union
and
simply
annul
the
entire
collective
bargaining
agreement.
they
key
word
is
"incentive".
the
purpose
of
the
rla,
which
flows
directly
from
section
1,
is
to
promote
bargaining
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
so
as
to
avoid
self
help.
and
what
violated
the
spirit
of
the
act
in
fec
was
the
carrier's
interpretation
of
the
act,
which
would
have
given
the
carrier
a
substantial
incentive
to
engage
in
self
help.
we
have
these
elaborate
processes,
what
the
court
has
described
as
machinery,
designed
to
adjust
disputes
and
avoid
self
help.
but
if
the
carrier
can
so
easily
side
step
that
elaborate
machinery
merely
by
submitting
some
changes
to
the
processes
of
the
act
while
hiding
others
until
self
help,
then
those
procedures
are
indeed
a
shambles.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
the
union's
primary
objective
is
certainly
not
to
displace
the
working
flight
attendant.
and
secondly,
justice
o'connor,
that
was
exactly
the
result
in
the
fec
case
which
has
been
on
the
books
for
22
years
and
congress
has
made
no
effort
to
change
it.
the
fec
court
specifically
found
that
a
union
security
provision
was
a
working
condition
subject
to
section
2
seventh
of
the
act
which
may
not
be
altered
unless
there
are
negotiations
over
that
provision,
except
in
certain
instances
during
a
strike,
which
is
certainly
not
at
issue
here
because
the
strike
was
over
long
before
the
district
court
even
ruled.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
i
only
know
that
union
security
provisions
is
one
of
the
issues
as
to
which
the
carrier
attempted
to
change
without
bargaining
and
the
court
indicated
that
you
could
not
do
that,
except
insofar
as
necessary
to
operate
during
the
strike.
and
the
rule
of
fec
is
that
the
carrier
and
the
union
must
bargain
over
that
which
they
intend
to
change.
under
any
contrary
rule,
i
submit,
the
railway
labor
act
simply
does
not
work.
a
section
6
notice
of
intended
changes
is
of
little
value
if
during
self
help
the
carrier
may
make
any
change
it
wishes.
how
effective
can
the
national
mediation
board
be,
if
it
is
only
mediating
the
changes
the
carrier
has
proposed
and
does
not
know
what
other
changes
the
carrier
intends
to
implement
during
self
help?
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
there
are
several
answers
to
that,
justice
scalia,
the
first
of
which
is
that
that
pretty
much
is
the
result
of
fec.
second,
if
somehow
the
carrier
cannot
operate
if
it
has
to
enforce
the
union
security
agreement
during
a
strike,
it
can
apply
to
the
district
court,
as
authorized
by
fec,
for
an
exception
to
the
requirements
of
2
seventh,
which
we
haven't
talked
about
yet.
and
third,
in
fact,
twa
has
in
its
proposals
issued
some
provisional
proposals
that
would
be
in
effect
only
during
a
strike.
if
you
will
examine
twa's
opening
proposals
that
are
in
the
joint
appendix,
they
talk
about
changing
the
crew
complement,
et
cetera,
in
turn,
if
there
was
a
strike.
so
i
think
there
are
ways
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
twa
made
just
such
a
proposal,
your
honor.
i
question
how
often
a
carrier
would
submit
to
interest
arbitration
if
it
knew
that
in
self
help
immediately
following
its
rejection
of
arbitration
it
could
obtain
far
more
from
self
help
than
the
arbitrator
could
even
conceivably
award.
i
also
question
how
seriously
a
carrier
would
take
the
recommendations
of
a
presidential
emergency
board
when
the
board
will
not
even
address
the
carrier's
hidden
agenda
for
self
help.
in
short,
we
believe,
as
the
courts
below
believe
and
as
i
believe
was
the
message
of
fec,
that
the
machinery
of
the
railway
labor
act
only
has
a
chance
to
work
if
it
is
given
the
chance
to
do
so.
with
that,
i
would
like
to
focus
for
a
few
moments
on
the
specific
language
of
section
2
seventh
of
the
act
and
section
6
of
the
act,
and
of
article
128
of
the
contract.
section
2
seventh
says,
no
carrier
shall
change
conditions
embodied
in
agreements
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
agreements
or
in
section
6.
and
the
emphasis
on
changes
in
conditions
in
agreements
as
opposed
to
just
changes
in
agreements
is
significant.
it
clearly
contemplates
that
there
will
be
changes
other
than
by
agreement.
it
clearly
contemplates
that
there
will
be
changes
other
than
by
wholesale
substitution
of
one
agreement
for
another.
the
phrase
"in
the
manner
prescribed
in
agreements.
"
has
no
relevance
here.
there
is
no
agreement
requiring
twa
to
eliminate
the
union
security
provisions
or
the
grievance
procedure
or
make
any
of
the
other
changes
that
it
made.
so
that
leaves
us
with
the
question
of
what
changes
may
be
made
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
section
6.
and
section
6
requires
that
carriers
and
unions
give
notice
of
their
intended
changes
and
agreements.
so
when
you
may
make
changes
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
section
6,
is
that
any
change
or
is
that
just
the
changes
of
which
you
gave
notice?
i
would
submit
that
the
only
logical
conclusion
is
that
pursuant
to
section
2
seventh,
the
carrier
may
make
only
those
unilateral
changes
of
which
it
gave
notice.
we
should
then
perhaps
focus
a
little
more
closely
on
the
language
of
section
6.
section
6
says
three
times
in
the
space
of
a
single
paragraph,
it
uses
the
phrase
"intended
changes
or
intended
change".
a
carrier
and
union
must
give
30
days'
notice
of
intended
changes.
if
the
services
of
the
nmb
are
invoked,
no
changes
may
be
made
until
the
nmb
has
finally
acted
upon
the
quote
"controversy"
close
quote.
what
is
the
controversy?
i
think
obviously
the
controversy
is
the
changes
intended.
so
when
a
carrier
may
make
those
changes
of
which
it
has
to
give
30
days'
notice,
what
changes
are
those?
the
only
logical
conclusion
it
seems
to
me
is
that
they
are
the
changes
which
were
the
subject
of
the
controversy,
the
changes
which
were
acted
upon
by
the
nmb,
the
changes
which
were
the
subject
of
the
section
6
notice.
any
other
conclusion
would
simply
completely
eviscerate
the
meaning
of
the
words
"intended
change".
and
as
to
the
contract
itself,
it
provides
that
it
renews
itself
indefinitely
without
change
unless
you
give
notice
of
specified
intended
changes.
and
again,
as
with
its
construction
of
section
6,
as
with
its
construction
of
section
7,
twa
contends
that
what
was
intended
was
that
notice
of
specified
intended
changes
would
be
a
signal
that
the
carrier
could
do
anything
it
wanted
during
self
help.
there
is
just
nothing
in
the
act,
or
in
the
contract,
i
believe,
that
allows,
much
less
requires,
such
an
interpretation,
so
at
odds
with
the
act's
primary
objective,
which
is
the
prevention
of
strikes.
this
court
has
described
the
rla
as
an
integrated,
harmonious
scheme.
no
less
than
four
sections...
section
2
seventh,
section
5,
section
6
and
section
10...
forbid
changes
so
that
the
processes
of
the
act
will
have
an
opportunity
to
work.
the
position
espoused
by
twa
would
make
those
procedures
optional
for
carriers.
it
would
allow,
as
the
district
court
said,
the
carrier
to
opt
out
of
the
bargaining
process
and
submit
only
selective
changes
or
perhaps
no
changes,
if
the
union
had
submitted
some,
knowing
that
there
are
no
limitations
once
self
help
begins.
moreover,
it
is
absurd
to
contend
that
the
result
below
has
somehow
deprived
twa
of
its
right
to
engage
in
self
help.
twa
has
engaged
and
is
engaging
in
massive
self
help.
it
has
operated
with
substantially
a
work
force
that
includes
a
large
number
of
replacements.
it
has
implemented
each
and
every
one
of
its
bargaining
proposals
without
compromise
and
it
has
implemented
many
other
changes
as
to
which
it
never
bargained.
and
all
that
is
at
issue
today
is
whether
twa
may
unilaterally
implement
that
which
it
never
proposed.
if
i
could
borrow
a
line
from
the
united
states,
in
a
brief
filed
in
the
fec
case:
"the
self
help
the
act
contemplates
is
self
help
in
adjusting
the
particular
disputes
being
negotiated.
"
in
other
words,
the
carrier
must
bargain
over
that
which
it
intends
to
change.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
there
were
two
consolidated
cases
and
the
united
states
was
the
plaintiff
and
petitioner
in
one
of
those
two,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
the
operative
language
appears,
i
believe,
in
section
2
seventh,
which
says
you
shall
not
change
agreements
except
in
the
manner
contained
in
agreements
or
in
section
6,
which
we
believe
was
enacted
to
say
you
can
only
make
those
changes
you
submitted
through
section
6
procedures.
i
don't
think
there
is
much
question
but
that
that
is
what
the
court
held
in
fec.
and
justice
white
pretty
well
says
it
in
his
opinion
in
fec.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
find
it
hard
to
conceive
of
the
notion
that
congress
enacted
section
2
seventh
only
to
deal
with
contracts
that
happen
to
be
of
indefinite
duration
without
saying
this
section
shall
apply
to
contracts
that
are
only
of
indefinite
duration.
a
more
logical
conclusion
is
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
say,
you
shall
not
have
contracts
with
what
the
district
court
characterized
as
comprehensive
termination
dates
where
every
change,
every
part
of
the
contract,
completely
self
destructs
if
you
give
notice
of
one
change.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
but
2
seventh
says
you
shall
not
change
conditions
as
embodied
in
agreements.
it
does
not
say
you
shall
not
change
agreements.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
well,
if
they
just
wanted
to
say
contracts,
they
could
have
said
you
shall
not
change
contracts.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
you
can
vary...
the
expiration
clause
is
really
in
most
contracts,
including
this
one,
more
of
a
moratorium
clause.
all
it
really
says
is,
you
shall
not
give
notice--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--well,
sure.
you
can
construct
a
duration
clause
that
says
you
shall
not
change
certain
things
before
a
date
certain.
that
does
not
relieve
you
of
your
obligation
to
bargain
over
that
which
you
want
to
change,
at
some
point.
i
did
want
to
point
out
that
obviously
twa's
desire
to
take
a
strike,
that
is
settle,
once
it
had
begun,
is
clearly
colored
by
its
belief
it
could
obtain
far
more
through
self
help
than
the
act
contemplates,
far
more
than
its
mere
bargaining
proposals.
for
all
we
know,
but
for
twa's
belief
that
it
could
annul
the
entire
contract
during
self
help,
there
would
never
have
been
a
strike.
and
also,
if
twa
is
limited
in
its
scope
of
self
help
by
the
scope
of
its
bargaining
proposals,
that
merely
puts
it
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
union.
a
union
cannot
make
a
unilateral
change.
it
can
only
strike
to
secure
change
through
an
agreement.
and
clearly,
any
proposed
changes
in
agreements
must
be
submitted
through
section
6.
as
the
court
said
in
shoreline,
only
if
both
sides
are
equally
restrained,
can
the
act's
remedies
work
effectively.
and
i
think,
under
the
act,
we
have
a
comprehensive
scheme
where
both
sides
are
limited
in
their
exercise
of
self
help
by
the
scope
of
their
bargaining
proposals.
i
would
like
to
speak
briefly
about
the
only
case
which
the
court--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--sure.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
believe
the
controversy
is
the
changes
submitted
to
the
bargaining
procedures
of
the
act.
and
section
6
says
you
may
not
change
any
conditions,
including
noncontractual
conditions.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
they
may
change
the
conditions
which
were
subject
to
the
bargaining
process.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
that's
right.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
think
that
is
the
clear
result
of
the
fec
opinion
and
of
the
reading
of
section--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--anything
over
which
they
have
no
bargained,
no,
except
insofar
as
necessary
to
operate
in
a
strike--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--in
the
fec
opinion.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
no.
all
they
have
to
do
is
issue
a
section
6
notice
of
changes
and
submit
those
changes
in
the
bargaining
process
and
let
the
nmb
submit
its
statutory
function
in
the
regard.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
sure,
if
an
agreement
says
in
year
one
you
will
be
paid
$8.00
and
in
year
two
you
will
be
paid
$9.00,
that
is
a
change
in
a
manner
prescribed
in
an
agreement.
or
if
there
is
a
new
agreement
that
says
you
will
be
paid
$10.00.
that
is
a
change
in
a
manner
prescribed
in
an
agreement.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
if
it
says
that,
i
suppose
you
could
do
it.
but
it
doesn't
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
is
implicit
in
the
statutory
scheme
and
i
don't
think
that
is
implicit
in
section
2
seventh.
i
think
to
give
any
comfort
to
twa,
the
contract
would
have
to
virtually
say
that
we
agree
that
once
the
self
help
period
begins
the
carrier
may
make
any
changes
it
will.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
but
the
contract
does
not
use
the
word
"expire",
justice
white.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
still
think
it
is
different,
yes,
under
section
2
seventh.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
yes.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
agree
with
the
district
court
when
it
said
that
under
the
rla
you
may
not
have
contracts
that
completely
self
destruct
upon
notice
of
specified
intended
changes.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
don't
think
i
am
following
you,
justice
white.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
but
this
contract
provides
that
it
renews
itself
from
year
to
year
without
change.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
if
the
contract
provides
that
the
carrier
may
do
what
it
pleases.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
then
i
think
under
section
6
and
section
2
seventh
you
have
to
bargain
over
the
specific
changes
you
intend
to
make.
i
might
add,
i
hope
that
this
is
not
inappropriate,
that
in
your
opinion
in
fec,--
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
--but
let
me
highlight
a
couple
of
words.
you
characterized
section
2
seventh
as
specific
and
unequivocal.
now,
if
all
section
2
seventh
means
is
that
contracts
are
enforceable,
that
is
not
specific
and
unequivocal.
that
is
general
and
unnecessary.
it's
redundant.
because
section
6
already
says
that.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
again,
i
don't
follow
the
question.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
they
resorted
to
evidence
in
the
record
for
aid
in
interpreting
the
contract.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
the
court
relied
on
evidence
as
to
what
the
parties
themselves
who
were
at
the
bargaining
table
believed
the
clause
to
mean.
that
certainly
is
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
i
suppose
if
you
would
get
the
union
to
agree
to
such
an
agreement,
your
honor,
it
would
have
that
effect.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
but
when
the
union
agreed
to
it,
the
union,
perhaps
their
counsel
had
read
the
fec
case
and
knew
that
you
could
only
make
the
changes
that
you
had
submitted
to
the
bargaining
process.
look
at
the
rationale
of
fec
and
tell
me
what
that
has
to
do
with
duration
clauses.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
the
central
theme
of
the
rla,
justice
scalia,
is
you
have
to
bargain
over
that
which
you
intend
to
change.
there
is
elaborate
machinery
that
says
you
must
submit
your
changes
to
the
processes
of
the
act
and
confined
and
refined
so
as
to
avoid
self
help.
mr.
steven
a.
fehr
it
is
somewhat
of
a
facetious
example,
justice
scalia.
but
i
suppose
that
is
possible.
that
is
not
realistically
what
happened
or
what
is
likely
to
happen.
the
theme
of
the
act
seem
to
be
clearly
that
you
have
to
bargain
over
that
which
you
intend
to
change.
otherwise,
a
carrier
can
submit
a
single
change
to
the
bargaining
process,
wait
for
self
help
and
then
change
anything
it
wishes.
and
there
was
not
a
single
change
proposed
here,
but
there
were
many,
many
changes
made
other
than
those
which
were
the
subject
of
the
act's
statutory
procedures.
right
along
the
lines
of
the
fec
opinion,
it
really
has
made
a
sham
of
the
act,
to
say
there
can
be
no
bargaining
over
union
security
or
the
grievance
procedure
or
many
other
things,
but
that
as
soon
as
self
help
comes,
we
are
going
to
eliminate
them.
the
carrier
can
simply
hold
back
and
wait
and
say
during
self
help
i
can
break
the
union
by
implementing
all
these
changes.
and
that
is
pretty
close
to
what
happened
in
this
case.
i
have
only
a
few
moments,
so
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
the
reeve
aleutian
case.
i
think
that
the
court
simply
missed
the
boat
entirely.
it
did
not
analyze
the
contractual
language.
it
did
not
discuss
what
the
meaning
of
section
2
seventh
was.
it
did
not
discuss
the
rationale
of
fec.
it
accepted
a
distinction
of
fed
which
its
own
district
court
said
was
not
clear
and
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
rationale.
it
says
that
the
act
is
concerned
with
changes
in
agreements,
when
the
act
in
section
2
seventh
and
in
the
fec
opinion,
clearly
we
are
concerned
with
unilateral
changes,
where
there
is
no
agreement
to
change.
and
reeve
gave
us
the
anomalous
result
that
a
carrier
that
proposed
no
changes
in
bargaining
could
make
any
change
it
wished
during
self
help.
i
would
refer
to
justice
posner's,
in
the
eeoc
case,
his
discussion
of
the
use
of
the
term
rla
contracts.
i
think
it
explains
many
of
the
semantics
which
twa
poses.
as
the
arguments
that
you
should
adopt
national
labor
relations
board,
there
are
many
reasons
why
you
should
not
do
that.
you
start
with
the
statement
in
burlington
northern
and
jacksonville
terminal,
to
the
effect
that
you
simply
do
not
adopt,
import
wholesale
a
detailed
panoply
of
law
from
the
nlra
into
the
rla.
second,
that
simply
begs
the
question.
before
you
would
say
that
board
law
should
be
applied,
you
would
have
to
first
determine
that
the
contract
expired
contrary
to
the
courts
below.
you
would
have
to
first
determine
that
section
seventh
does
not
mean
what
we
say
it
means
and
what
the
district
court
said
it
meant,
before
you
even
reach
that
issue.
in
addition,
the
case
law
under
the
board
is
really
not
all
that
different.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
trico
products
case.
