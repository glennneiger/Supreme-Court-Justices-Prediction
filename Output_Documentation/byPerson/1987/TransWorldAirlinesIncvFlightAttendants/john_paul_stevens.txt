justice
stevens
i
can
understand
how
you
read
it
that
way
as
support
for
your
position
in
the
language.
but
i
am
just
perhaps
quibbling
about
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
they
say
there
were
two
issues.
the
district
court
stated
there
were
two
issues.
one,
did
article
28,
the
duration
provisions
of
the
contract,
cause
parts
of
the
contract
that
were
not
subject
to
bargaining
to
continue
in
effect,
or
did
notice
of
certain
attendant
changes
trigger
a
total
termination
of
the
agreement?
and
he
said
he
answered
that
a
different
way
than
you
would
answer
it.
then
they
said
the
second
issue
is
a
statutory
issue,
and
they
don't
reach
the
statutory
issue.
maybe
they
are
dead
wrong,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
they
held,
if
you
have
just
nothing
but
the
language
of
the
contract,
that
the
contract,
in
a
mutilated
form,
as
you
put
it,
did
survive.
justice
stevens
correct.
page

justice
stevens
at
the
bottom
the
page
they
start
the
discussion
and
they
state
the
two
issues.
and
the
first
one
seems
to
be
a
contract
issue
and
the
second
is
a
statutory
issue
and
they
say
we
only
decide
the
contract
issue.
justice
stevens
i
just
don't
read
their
opinion
that
way.
i
agree
that
they
construed
it
in
the
light
of
all
these
policies
you
describe.
but
the
bottom
line
seems
to
be
their
interpretation
of
what
the
agreement
provided.
justice
stevens
what
i
really
wanted
to
ask
you
about
is
if
there
is
an
obligation
to
maintain
certain
working
conditions
during
the
period
of
impasse,
is
that
a
statutory
obligation
or
a
contractual
obligation?
justice
stevens
so
it
really
is
your
view,
is
it
not,
then,
that
the
entire
contract
terminated
when
you
gave
whatever
the
date
period
was
after
the
notice?
justice
stevens
i
thought
you
had
taken
a
different
position
in
answer
to
justice
scalia.
justice
stevens
i
think
it
may
relate
to
the
theory
of
what
happened
to
the
balance
of
the
contract.
that
is
what
i
did
not
know
for
sure
what
your
position
was.
justice
stevens
but
it
really
makes
a
big
difference,
at
least
to
my
understanding
of
the
case,
whether
the
reason
any
of
the
terms
and
conditions
may
not
be
changed
is
a
contractual
reason
or
a
statutory
reason.
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals,
they
said
it
was
a
contractual
reason.
they
did
not
reach
the
question.
justice
stevens
they
did
not
reach
the
statutory
issue.
justice
stevens
and
if
we
read
the
contract
otherwise,
just
read
it
as
a
plain,
ordinary
contract,
it
seems,
by
its
terms,
to
expire.
it
says
in
so
many
words
that
it
will
renew
unless
they
serve
a
notice.
and
they
served
the
notice.
justice
stevens
i
know
the
district
court
read
it
the
other
way.
justice
stevens
correct.
so
that
means
that
if
you
do
give
the
notice
then
it
doesn't
renew.
justice
stevens
under
ordinary
grammar.
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
bargaining
history.
justice
stevens
no,
that
is
not
the
point
at
all.
the
contract
in
terms
says
that
it
shall
remain
in
effect
until
july
31,
1984,
and
thereafter
shall
renew
itself
without
change
for
yearly
periods
unless
written
notice
of
change
is
served.
written
notice
of
change
was
served.
therefore,
it
doesn't
renew
itself.
that
is
plain
language.
that
is
what
other
courts
of
appeals
have
held,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not.
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
with
one
question
before
you
go
on?
justice
stevens
would
you
tell
me
what
you
understand
section
156
to
mean
when
it
says
there
shall
be
no
change
until
the
controversy
has
been
finally
acted
upon?
what
in
your
view
do
the
words
"controversy
has
been
finally
acted
upon.
"
refer
to?
justice
stevens
just
go
a
little
slower
for
me.
say
you
don't
come
to
an
agreement
and
you
go
through
the
various
mediation
procedures
and
they
all
result
in
an
impasse.
may
they
then
change?
justice
stevens
right.
but
only
as
proposed.
justice
stevens
but
only
as
to
their
proposal.
i
see.
justice
stevens
and
they
may
never
change
anything
else?
justice
stevens
under
that
case.
