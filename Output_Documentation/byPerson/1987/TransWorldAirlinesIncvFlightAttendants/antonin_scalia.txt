justice
scalia
i
thought
you
said
that
question
was
not
before
us
here.
the
way
you
are
talking
now,
you
are
expanding
that
proposition
not
just
to
the
union
security
provision
but
to
all
the
provisions
of
the
contract.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
either
argue
you
want
to
be
like
the
nlra
or
you
do
not
want
to
be
like
the
nlra.
if
you
want
to
be
like
the
nlra,
you
ought
to
give
up
on
the
proposition
that
the
rest
of
the
contract
does
not
continue
but
say
that
nonetheless,
the
union
security
provision
doesn't
continue.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
want
to
be
different
from
the
nlra,
the--
--we
have
no
choice
justice
scalia.
that
his
what
congress
wanted.
congress
said
that
the
two
provisions
should
be
the
same.
that
is
what
the
legislative
history
discloses.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
giving
up
on
the
other
point.
the
other
points
are
not
here.
they
were
not
in
the
case
below,
they
are
not
in
the
grant
of
certiorari.
so
we
will
not
say
any
more
about
it.
with
reference
to
section
211,
which
this
case
is
about,
that
section
requires
an
agreement.
the
agreement
here
was
expressly
limited
in
time
to
july
31,
1984.
it
did
not
renew
itself,
because
both
parties
served
noticed
that
they
wanted
to
have
a
changed
agreement
and
therefore
the
condition
for
non-renewal
was
met.
i
make
that
statement
only
with
specific
reference
to
the
union
security
clause.
section
6
of
the
act
then
required,
as
the
manning
court
in
the
second
circuit
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
reeve
aleutian
case,
that
all
conditions,
including
the
union
security
clause,
be
continued
during
the
status
quo
period.
there
is
nothing
in
the
railway
labor
act,
however,
that
subsequently
transforms
that
statutory
obligation
to
adhere
to
that
condition
od
employment
embodied
in
the
union
security
clause,
which
transforms
it
into
a
new
agreement
after
the
status
quo
period
has
ended.
mr.
gartner,
let
me
just
ask
this
question.
is
it
not
correct
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
the
agreement,
even
without
the
aid
of
the
statute,
provided
for
automatic
renewal
with
respect
to
the
provisions
that
were
not
the
subject
of
negotiation?
justice
scalia
but
you
still
hang
upon
the
fact
that
this
contract
terminated,
right?
justice
scalia
all
right.
but
let's
assume
that
the
termination
provision
that
you
rely
upon
did
not
exist
and
you
had
a
contract
that
was
simply
of
indefinite
duration.
the
result
would
seem
just
as
absurd
under
that
contract,
too.
you
would
have
the
same
situation
of
a
strike
occurring
and
those
new
hires
who
don't
want
anything
to
do
with
the
union
are
paying
the
union
to
try
to
get
them
put
out
of
work.
justice
scalia
how
do
you
get
out
of
it
in
a
situation
where
you...
and
i
gather
most
of
the
contracts
in
this
industry
are
not
with
a
fixed
termination
date
as
this
one.
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
scalia
all
right,
but
let's
assume,
whatever
industry.
if
i
can't
get
out
of
this
situation,
if
there
is
no
gimmick
in
the
statute,
i
can't
rely
on
211
in
those
other
situations
where
the
contract,
by
its
own
terms,
is
still
in
effect.
so
if
i
am
bound
to
say
the
absurdity
has
to
exist
in
all
these
other
situations,
why
shouldn't
it
exist
here,
too?
justice
scalia
before
you
do,
may
i
ask
a
question?
assume
that
you
have
a
rate
of
pay
that
is
not
the
subject
of
negotiation,
you
have
an
impasse
develop.
do
you
agree
that
you
are
under
an
obligation
to
continue
to
pay
the
people
at
the
old
rate
of
pay,
the
contract
rate
of
pay?
justice
scalia
are
they
talking
about
the
statute
or
are
they
talking
about
the
contract?
justice
scalia
i
understand.
but
to
the
extent
that
they
read
"expire"
differently,
as
you
are
saying,
they
may
be
talking
about
the
statutory
effects
rather
than
what
the
contract
itself
provides.
justice
scalia
but
again
is
he
saying
that
because
the
contract
doesn't
allow
it
or
is
he
saying
it
because
the
statute
doesn't
allow
it?
justice
scalia
on
the
other
hand,
i
really
wonder
how
successful
any
mediation
effort
is
going
to
be
if
you
are
requiring
the
carrier,
if
it
wishes
to
avoid
the
situation
that
has
occurred
here,
to
put
on
the
table
elimination
of
the
union
security
agreement
every
time.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
something
that
is
likely
to
produce
a
quick
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
company,
and
that
is
the
effect
of
what
you
are
saying.
in
order
to
avoid
this
situation,
every
time
you
have
to
put
on
the
table
the
first
thing
we
are
going
to
do
is
eliminate
the
union
security
clause.
justice
scalia
mr.
fehr,
on
this
point,
what
language
are
you
relying
on
in
section
156
which
says
hat
where
a
change
has
been
proposed,
in
every
case
where
such
notice
of
intended
change
has
been
given,
blah,
blah,
blah,
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions,
shall
not
be
altered
until
the
controversy
has
been
finally
acted
upon?
the
implication
seems
to
be,
that
when
that
proposed
change
has
been
acted
upon,
you
can
alter
not
just
the
matter
of
that
proposed
change
but
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
generally.
justice
scalia
that
section
may
just
refer
to
agreements
that
are
continuing
beyond,
by
their
terms,
beyond
the
negotiation
period.
justice
scalia
but
you
are
not
changing
an
agreement
if
the
agreement
is
not
in
effect.
if
the
agreement
is
terminated,
you
are
not
changing
it.
justice
scalia
conditions
as
embodied
in
agreements.
justice
scalia
or,
if
the
agreement
itself
provides
for
a
change.
right?
i
mean,
that
is
clearly
allowed.
that
is
clearly
allowed.
the
agreement
itself
can
provide
for
a
change.
justice
scalia
what
if
it
says
in
year
four
our
agreement
as
to
what
you
will
be
paid
will
cease
and
you
will
be
paid
what
we
determine
you
will
be
paid?
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
just
says
in
year
four,
what
we
had
agreed
to
pay
you
will
cease.
don't
you
think
it
is
implicit
that
we
will
pay
you
what
we
feel
like
it
after
that?
justice
scalia
mr.
fehr,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
last
concession
really
suggests
that
there
is
not
as
much
policy
involved
in
all
of
this
as
you
have
been
saying.
you
acknowledge
that
everything
that
twa
wanted
to
do
here
it
could
do
without
violating
any
of
the
policies
of
the
railway
labor
act,
so
long
as
it
had
said
in
the
agreement,
instead
of
this
agreement
shall
terminate
on
x
date,
and
nothing
more,
so
long
as
it
had
said,
this
agreement
shall
terminate
on
x
date,
whereafter,
we
shall
have
the
right
to
impose
whatever
terms
and
conditions
we
want.
justice
scalia
unless
you
think
the
union
agreed
to
that
when
it
agreed
to
the
fact
that
the
contract
terminates
on
such
and
such
a
date.
justice
scalia
even
so,
you
are
just
talking
about
using
the
wrong
words.
and
there
is
no
policy
of
the
rla
that
will
come
tumbling
down
no
matter
how
we
come
out
on
that
point,
because
the
same
policy
can
be
achieved
by
just
putting
it
that
way.
justice
scalia
unless
you
put
the
change
in
the
agreement.
you
have
acknowledge
that
you
can
say
in
the
agreement,
after
x
date
we
will
have
whatever
terms
and
conditions
we
want.
you
have
acknowledge
that
you
can
do
that.
