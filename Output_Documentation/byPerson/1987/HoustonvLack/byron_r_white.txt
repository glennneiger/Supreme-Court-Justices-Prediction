justice
white
well,
he
would
have
had
to...
would
he
have
had
to
have
a
certificate,
some
affidavit?
justice
white
so
you
suggest
that
we
should
simply
construe
the
word
"filed"
as
used
in
the
rules
as
being
satisfied
if
he
has
delivered
his
notice
of
appeal
to
the
prison
authorities
in
ample
time?
justice
white
and
your
argument
is
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
gave
it
to
prison
authorities
or
not
under
your
rule.
all
he
had
to
do
within
time
was
to...
within
the
allotted
time
was
to
put
it
in
the
mailbox.
justice
white
well,
no,
but
he
put
it
in
the
regular
prison
mailbox
to
go
out,
and
he
put
it
in
on
the
day
long
before
the
time
expired.
and
you
say
he
should...
he
should
be
deemed
to
have
complied
with
the
rule
then?
justice
white
the
prison
authorities
may
have
put
it
in
the
mail
right
then.
justice
white
and
then
the
only
problem
would
be
the
mail.
justice
white
well,
so
he
drops
it
in
the
mailbox
instead
of
giving
it
to
the
prisoner,
and
it
doesn't
arrive
in
time.
justice
white
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
in
the
record
when
they
actually
mailed
it
either.
justice
white
well,
they
might
have
sat
on
it
for
two
or
three
days.
justice
white
what
if
they
did?
would
that
make
any
difference
to
you?
justice
white
because?
why
wouldn't
fallen
cover
it
then?
justice
white
suppose
we
reject
that
argument
and
say
that
fallen
would
apply
anyway
if
it
otherwise
would
apply?
justice
white
if
it's
clear...
do
you
think
the
fallen
might
well
apply
if
it
were
clear
the
prison
authorities
just
sat
on
it
for
a
week?
justice
white
it
would
be
all
right
for
the
statute.
if
the
rules
said
these
papers
shall
be
deemed
filed
if
they
are
put
in
the
united
states
mails.
justice
white
i
suppose
it
might
be...
do
you
think
that
this
court
is...
is
it
within
its
competence
to
construe
the
word
file
in
an
individual
case
like
this?
