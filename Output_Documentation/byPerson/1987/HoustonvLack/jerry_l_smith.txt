mr.
jerry
l.
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
four
or
five
things
that
i
think
i
should
disabuse
the
court
of
any
notion
that
may
have
been
suggested
by
counsel
concerning
this
particular
inmate,
and
this
particular
record.
first
of
all,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
suggests
that
mr.
houston
is
as
unlettered
as
counsel
suggests
that
he
is.
secondly,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
suggests
that
mr.
houston
was
not
allowed
by
prison
authorities
to
call
the
clerk's
office
and
inquire
after
his
notice
of
appeal.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
suggests
that
prison
authorities
delayed
in
any
way
the
mailing
of
the
notice
of
appeal
after
it
was
given
to
them
by
mr.
houston.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
no,
that's
correct
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
it
is
conceivable.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
well,
because
i
think
fallen
is
a
criminal
case,
first
of
all,
and
as
a
criminal
case
there
are
no
congressionally
set
deadlines,
filing
deadlines.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
well,
then
i
think
that
fallen
may
apply
in
the
case
of...
it
is
a
case
that
i
submit
to
you--
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
--oh,
i
think
it's
conceivable
that
fallen
would
apply
in
that
particular
kind
of
case.
i
think
there
is,
though
given
the--
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
--that's
correct,
it
may
not
be
necessarily
fallen.
there
may
be
a
due
process
objection.
there
are
also
certainly
another
way
out
of
this
box
for
him
had
prison
officials
sat
on
this
for
a
week,
and
that's
the
rule
60
argument,
i
think,
that
would
have
available
to
the
petitioner
if,
in
fact,
such
an
extraordinary
thing
had
happened
as
the
prison
authorities
deliberately
interfered
with
his
right
to
file
an
appeal.
i
think
that
would
be
available
to
him.
i
think
it
is
noteworthy
as
counsel
did
mention,
that
mr.
houston
addressed
his
notice
of
appeal
to
the
wrong
post
office
box,
and
the
wrong
zip
code,
and
i
think
it
highly
probable,
given
that
fact
which
is
undisputed,
that
that
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
delay
in
the
mailing
of
the
notice
of
appeal.
we
are
not
unsympathetic
to
the
plight
of
pro
se
litigants,
in
pro
se
incarcerated
litigants.
as
such,
we
know
the
court
is
not
unsympathetic
to
the
plight
of
those
litigants.
and
as
such,
the
court
has,
in
fact,
granted
several
dispensations
to
pro
se
litigants
concerning
the
form
of
their
pleadings,
certain
formalities
in
the
pleadings
are
waived
in
the
litigants,
but
here
we
deal
with
the
case
where
jurisdictional
significance
is
involved.
there
must
come
a
point
in
time,
we
submit
to
you,
a
definite
point
in
time
where
litigation
must
end
if
an
appeal
is
not
perfected
before
the
deadline
for
doing
so
expires.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
well,
i
think
there's
a
problem
with
the
argument.
there
is
a
couple
of
problems
with
the
argument.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
oh,
if
that
is,
yes.
i
mean,
it
would
serve
that
particular
concern
if
it
was
treated
as
a
motion.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
that's
right.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
that's
right.
if
it
is
beyond
the
time--
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
--yes,
and
if
it
comes
one
day
beyond
the
extended
30
days,
this
argument
will
not
wash.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
that's
right,
it
wouldn't.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
there
is
no
argument
to
make
in
that
kind
of
case.
i
think
the
problems
that
are
inherent
in
a
rule...
in
a
rule
that
construes
late
filed
notice
of
appeal
within
the
extension
period
as
being
a
motion
for
an
extension
are,
first,
it
runs
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
the
rule,
which
requires
that
a
motion
be
filed.
i
think
another
point
to
be
made
on
that,
and
this
does
not
necessarily
make
the
conclusion
that
we
reach
correct,
but
i
think
it
is
very
instructive,
and
that
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
have
considered
this
argument
have
rejected
this
argument,
including
the
fourth
circuit,
which
has
rejected
this
argument
sitting
on
bank.
i
think
those
two
factors
taken
together
certainly
indicate
that
in
amending
rule
4(a)(5)
to
provide
that
in
all
instances
a
motion
must
be
filed
in
order
to
obtain
an
extension,
and
that
informal
grants
of
extension
of
time
would
not
be
favored,
mitigate
against
counsel's
argument
that
a
rule
4(a)(5)
extension
can
be
granted
when
there
is
a
late
filed
notice
of
appeal
within
the
extension
period.
i
think
it
is
noteworthy
here
too
that
the
extension
period
for
criminal
appeals
in
4(b)
may
be
extended
with
or
without
notice,
and
with
or
without
a
motion.
so
that
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
the
requirement
for
civil
litigants
that
a
motion
must
be
filed.
so
i
think
those
are
the
problems
with
construing
a
rule...
a
late
filed
notice
of
appeal,
as
a
motion
for
an
extension
of
time.
certainly
we
are
interested
in
finality.
we
are
particularly
interested
in
finality
of
judgments
in
habeas
corpus
cases.
the
court
has
recognized
that
federal
habeas
corpus
cases
significantly
intrude
into
the
operations
of
the
state
criminal
courts.
the
court
has
recognized
that
this
often
causes
significant
friction
between
the
state
governments
and
the
federal
governments.
and
so
we
think
it
particularly
efficatious
to
have
a
rule
that
allows
the
states
to
be
free
of
habeas
corpus
litigation
at
a
definite
point
in
time.
it
should
be
noted
that
there
may
be
a
way
out
of
the
box
that
a
petitioner
who
is...
excuse
me,
an
appellant
who
is
a
day
late,
or
is
some
way
late,
somehow
prevented
from
taking
his
appeal
in
a
timely
fashion.
that
is
a
rule
60
motion
under
rule
60
of
the
rules
of
appellant
procedure...
excuse
me,
of
civil
procedure.
in
this
particular
case
no
such
motion
was
filed
despite
the
fact
that
such
a
motion
may
have
been
timely
for
over
four
months
of
a
period
in
time
when
the
appellant
was
counseled,
was
not
a
pro
se
litigant.
however,
he
chose
not
to
engage
in--
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
--no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
i
do
have
an
objection
to
that.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
that
it
flies
in
the
clear
language
of
the
rules
concerning
filing.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
oh,
by
the
rules
amendment
process
we
have
absolutely
no
objection
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
if
the
rules
said
that,
yes,
your
honor,
because
i
think
the
definition
of
what
is
filing
is
a
matter
that
would
probably
be
left
to
promulgation
of
the
court
rule.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
well,
it
certainly
is,
but
i
submit
to
you
when
the
rule
could
not
be
plainer
to
say
that
file
means
delivery
to
the
clerk,
that
it
would
be
an
extraordinary
torturous
interpretation
of
that
language.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
yes.
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
was
issued
on
february
18th.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
well,
i
think
that
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
the
bare
issue
on
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
the
statements
of
the
district
court,
and
actions
of
the
district
court
in
the
thompson
and
wolfsohn
cases,
where
counsel
was
virtually
assured
that
the
appeal
period
had
been
extended
or
told,
affirmatively
assured.
i
think
petitioner
may
or
may
not.
we
do
not
know
the
accuracy...
i
cannot
know
what
he
thought.
but
he
may
or
may
not
have
made
a
faulty
assumption
that
his
appeal
was
timely
progressing.
but
it
strikes
me
as
odd
that
his
faulty
assumption
can
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
yes,
they
issued
a
briefing
schedule.
i
believe
that
was
some
time
in
march,
a
briefing
schedule
was
issued.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
briefing
schedule
was
issued.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
under?
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
well,
we
submit
to
you
concerning
thompson
and
wolfsohn
that
those
cases
may
be
of
limited
continuing
validity,
with
all
due
respect.
this
court
has
since
those
cases
were
decided
decided
a
number
of
cases
that
seem
to
indicate
that
late
filed
notices...
late
filed
motions,
post
judgment
motions
which
would
toll
the
time
for
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
that
were
considered
in
thompson
and
wolfsohn,
this
court
has
resoundingly
said
rejected
the
argument
in
browder,
the
notion
in
browder,
that
those
could
serve
under
any
circumstances
to
toll
the
time
for
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
appeal.
so
those
cases
may
be
of
limited
continuing
validity.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
we
have
no
quarrel
if
this
court
wishes
to
adopt
a
rule
that
puts
the
clerks
of
the
various
federal
district
courts
on
notice
that
they
should
create
a
pro
se
desk,
and
through
that
pro
se
desk,
pro
se
filings,
especially
jurisdictional
ones,
should
be
screened
for
timeliness,
and
that
litigants
be
notified
of
that
fact.
it
is
significant,
however,
that
the
court
has
not
done
that.
this
court
has
not
done
that.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
not
done
that,
although
they
have
suggested
that
such
a
course
of
action
would
be
advisable.
we
submit
to
you
that
it
is
a
proper
function
for
the
court
to
undertake
to
create
such
a
rule,
and
it
may
be
advisable,
but
it
should
be
done
through
the
rulemaking
process
and
not
by
judicial
fiat
in
individual
court
decisions.
i
think
there
are
issues
concerning
the
administrative
burden
that
this
may
be
placing
on
the
various
district
courts,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
need
for
that
in
every
federal
district
court.
many
federal
districts
are
busier
than
other
federal
districts.
and
i
think
that
is
a
matter
that
would
be
best
to
come
through
the
rule
promulgation
process
where
it
is
open
for
comment,
and
such
as
this.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
that's
correct,
it
would.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
the
federal
rules.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
yes.
i
mean,
the
federal
rules
should
be
amended.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
yes,
it
could
be
done.
the
individual
circuits
could
also
modify
their
rules.
they
have
not
done
so.
it
is
ironic
that
having
noted
that
that
would
be
an
advisable
course
of
action
in
several
cases,
to
my
knowledge
they
have
not
acted
in
respect
to
the
course
of
action
that
justice
marshall
suggested.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
in
closing,
we
would
like
to
say
to
the
court
that
it
is
clear
under
innumerable
decisions
of
this
court
that
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
4(a)'s
time
limits
are
jurisdictional,
and
in
the
interest
of
finality,
of
litigation,
should
not
be
considered
waiverable.
in
those
exceptional
cases
where
equitable
concerns
may
override
interests
in
finality,
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
60
may
provide
the
escape
hatch.
three
members
of
this
court
have
recognized
that
rule
60
may
provide
such
an
escape
hatch.
at
least
two
federal
circuits
have
recognized
that
it
may
provide
an
escape
hatch.
any
other
rules--
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
--i
believe
it
was
in
the
case
of
browder
v.
the
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
correction
in
a
concurring
opinion,
i
believe,
offered
by
justice
blackmun,
and
with
two
justices
concurring,
recognize
that
under
slightly
altered
circumstances
rule
60(b)
could
be
used
to
vacate
an
old
judgment
and
reenter
it
to
start
afresh
the
judgment...
the
time
for
the
appeal
running.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
no,
that
wasn't
the
action
of
the
court.
no,
in
fact,
the
action
of
the
court
was
dismissal
of
the
appeal
for
untimeliness,
and
it
is
noteworthy
here
that
the
petitioner
has
never
availed
himself
of
the
rule
60
process,
made
no
attempt
to
avail
himself
of
the
rule
60
process,
relying
instead
on
the
hope
that
the
court
would
adopt
equitable
exceptions
to
a
jurisdictional
and
mandatory
time
period.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
well,
your
honor,
again
it
is
a
point
that
the
way
you
treat
pro
se
litigants
is
almost
a
point
without
rational
departure.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
it's...
you
have
to...
it
seems
to
me
if
you
are
to
have
an
orderly
system
of
justice
at
some
point
in
time,
charge
people
with
knowledge
of
how
that...
some
knowledge,
some
rudimentary
knowledge
of
how
that
system
operates,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
held
in
its
leniency
to
pro
se
defendants
that
they
are
excused
from
complying
with
jurisdictional
requirements,
that
all
bets
are
off,
you
just
come
to
court
one
day
and
tell
what
your
case
is.
i
don't
think
anyone
has...
any
court
has
ever
excused
them
to
that
degree.
we
submit
to
you
that
any
other
rules
that
the
court
might
develop
concerning
whether
or
not
individuals
in
the
petitioner's
situation
should
come
through
the
rulemaking
process,
not
through
judicial
decision.
in
the
words
of...
to
paraphrase
mr.
justice
clark
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
in
thompson
v.
the
internal
revenue
service,
rules
of
appellate
procedure
are
a
necessary
part
of
an
orderly
system
of
justice,
but
the
courts
must
be
willing
to
enforce
those
rules
according
to
their
terms
if
they
are
to
have
any
efficacy.
the
court
should
not
engage
in
ad
hoc
dispensations
in
particular
facts,
and
in
particular
cases,
because
that
would
undermine
the
certainty
of
the
rules,
and
only
ultimately
cause
confusion
amongst
the
bench
and
bar.
we
submit
to
you
that
if
you
adopt
the
equitable
exceptions
pressed
upon
you
by
petitioner
today,
that
will,
in
fact,
undermine
the
certainty
of
these
rules,
which
in
my
mind
cannot
be
plainer,
and
it
will,
in
fact,
add
to
the
confusion
of
the
bench
and
bar
as
under
what
circumstances
the
plain
meaning
of
rules.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
well,
in
some
cases
the
rules
are
confused,
yes,
your
honor,
but
not
in
all
cases.
but
it
will
add,
i
think,
unnecessarily
to
further
confusion
amongst
the
bench
and
bar
for
another
ad
hoc
exception
for
pro
se
appellants.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
well,
ms.
white
today
inherited
a
pro
se
case,
and
is
having
to
live
with
the
result.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
there
may
well
be.
mr.
jerry
l.
smith
very
much.
in
fact,
i
submit
to
you
that
with
these
line
of
cases
in
effect,
and
if
ms.
white
and
petitioner
have
their
way,
we
would
certainly
be
confused
as
to
whenever
we
might
efficaciously
move
to
dismiss
an
appeal
for
failure
to
file
a
timely
notice
of
appeal.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
we
would
submit
the
case
on
the
argument.
