h.
rehnquist
ms.
white,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
was
a
direct
appeal?
that
was
during
the
process
of
direct
appeal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
to
meet
a
jurisdictional
deadline?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
we
should
incorporate
all
those
doctrines
into
something
where
you
are
trying
to
talk
about
whether
the
court
of
appeals
has
jurisdiction
of
a
case?
i
would
think
there
you
would
want
to
have
probably
the
strongest
possible
stand
against
things
that
are
just
going
to
make
every...
the
timeliness
of
every
appeal
very
uncertain.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
the
cases
you're
talking
about,
the
district
court
had
indicated
that
a
motion
to
grant
an
extension
would
be
granted,
or
at
least
assured
the
people
that
what
they
proposed
to
do
would
be
timely,
although
he
was,
in
fact,
wrong.
here
there
was
no
such
explicit
assurance
to
your
client.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
inmate
then
is
not
required
to
conform
to
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
if
he
is
going
pro
se
in
a
way
that
other
parties
are?
chief
justice
rehnquist
absolutely
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
the
kerner
case,
that
was
a
statement
that
they
are
not
held
to
the
same
level
of
expertise
in
drafting
a
complaint.
don't
you
see
any
difference
between
that
and
requirement
that
everybody
comply
with
the
same
rule
as
to
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
any
of
those
cases
say
that
those...
that
pro
se
inmates
could
not
conform
with
the
jurisdictional
rule,
either
darr,
or
price
against
johnston,
or
holiday
against
johnston?
chief
justice
rehnquist
could
you
answer
the
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you're
suggesting
because
of
the
filing
stamp
in
the
morning,
and
that
a
lot
of
stuff
is
filed
that
early
in
the
morning,
it
might
have
been
received
the
day
before?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may.
thank
you,
ms.
white.
i
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
case
was
it,
mr.
smith,
in
which
three
members
of
the
court
recognized
that
60(b)
might
be
an
escape
hatch
in
a
situation
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
white.
ms.
smith,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
white.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
87-5428,
houston
against
lack.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
brennan
and
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice

dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
o'connor,
kennedy,
