marshall
you
are
not
trying
to
tell
me
that
a
prisoner
doesn't
know
about
the
calendar,
and
the
days?
they
can
count
days
faster
than
anybody
else
can.
justice
marshall
and
they
know
how
to
do
it.
i
don't
think
that
helps
you
at
all.
i
think
the
point
is
that...
the
best
they
can
do
is
to
give
it
to
the
jail
authorities.
he
can't
go
out
and
mail
it.
justice
marshall
what
would
you
say
if
the
rule
was
it
must
be...
show
a
postmark
of
a
certain
date,
that
it
was
mailed
on
the
certain
date?
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
marshall
you'd
have
no
objection
to
that,
would
you?
justice
marshall
what
would
be
the
objection?
justice
marshall
i
said
to
change
the
rule.
justice
marshall
if
you
say
rule
and
not
judicial,
do
you
mean
the
federal
rules
or
court
rules?
justice
marshall
because
the
court
rules
would
be
judicial
fiat.
justice
marshall
well,
couldn't
it
be
done
by
the
circuit
rules?
justice
marshall
have
you
heard
of
it?
justice
marshall
but
that
wasn't
the
action
of
the
court.
