general
smith,
i
suppose
that
interest
would
be
met
by
taking
your
point
of
second
argument
that
you
always
treat
the
notice
that
is
a
couple
of
days
late
under
these
circumstances
as
a
motion
to
extend
time.
you
would
have
an
extra
30
days,
but
you
would
have
a
deadline
you
could
work
with.
justice
stevens
right,
there
are
problems
with
it,
but
at
least
it
would
solve
that
particular
concern.
justice
stevens
well,
sure,
you
couldn't
make
the
rule
whatever
it
is,
4(a)(1)(5),
for
a
five
rule
in
that
circumstance.
that's
all.
the
argument
just
wouldn't
apply.
justice
stevens
if
you
buy
her
argument,
you
would
have
an
outside
number
of
30
days.
the
fact
that
you
are
there
on
the
61st
day,
there
is
just
no
argument
to
make.
justice
stevens
it
won't
affect
the
bar
because
we
are
talking
about
pro
se
cases.
justice
stevens
would
it
affect
the
bar
when
we're
just
confining
it
to
pro
se
cases?
it
will
confuse
the
bench,
i
agree.
justice
stevens
we
will
not
confuse
ms.
white.
there
may
well
be
a
lawyer
on
the
other
side
in
the
civil
case.
justice
stevens
so
it
would
be
confusing
to
that
lawyer
as
to
whether
the
appeal
is
alive
or
dead.
