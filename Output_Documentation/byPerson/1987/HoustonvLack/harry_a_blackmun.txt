justice
blackmun
that's
terribly
hard
on
the
pro
se
indigent
prisoner,
isn't
it,
that
rule?
it's
always
bothered
me,
i'd
like
to
say.
i
think
we
are
unfair
on
these
people.
justice
blackmun
that
was
justice
stewart's
suggestion,
wasn't
it,
in
fallen?
justice
blackmun
you're
admitting
they
are
confused
now
when
you
say
it
will
add
to
the
confusion.
