justice
scalia
what
if
the
post
office
takes
ten
days
to...
you
know,
some
of
us
feel
just
as
helpless
putting
it
in
the
mailbox
as
a
prisoner
might
feel
delivering
it
to
the
warden.
what
if
a
post
office
takes
this
ten
days?
should
that
litigant,
whether
pro
se,
or
otherwise,
be
given
any
less
consideration?
justice
scalia
we
just
had
a
case
the
other
day,
ms.
white,
about
a
post
office
employee
who
was
dismissed
for
keeping
mail
in
the
trunk
of
his
car
for
a
year
and
never
delivering
it.
i
mean,
if
the
chief
justice
is
talking
about
some
certainty
as
to
whether
there
has
been
an
appeal
filed,
is
the
case
over,
or
isn't
it,
to
make
it
effective
upon
mailing
certainly
puts
the
other
side
at
a
lot
of
risk.
you
just
sort
of
have
to
hope
that
the
post
office
has
picked
the
right
mail
carrier,
that
it
is
not
in
the
trunk
of
somebody's
car,
or
whatever
else.
don't
we
need
something
a
little
more
certain
than
that?
justice
scalia
but
you're
suggesting
a
rule
that
leaves
itself
open
to
that
kind
of
uncertainty.
any
mailbox
rule,
the
other
side,
really
doesn't
know.
you
can
hope
that
the
mails
were
delivered
properly,
but
as
the
chief
justice
says,
we're
talking
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
we
are
talking
about
whether
litigation
is
finally
terminated.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
factors
involved
here
when
you
say
substantially
complies,
and
when
you
say
unlettered
litigant,
whatever.
you
don't
have
to
be
lettered
to
know
30
days
means
30
days.
i
mean,
certainly
there
are
some
rules
that
are
so
rudimentary
that
everybody
has
to
be
held
to
it.
i
can't
see
what
difference
it
makes
that
someone
is
unlettered
whether
he
complies
with
the
30
day
deadline
or
not.
and
secondly,
you
talk
about
substantial
compliance.
there
is
no
possibility
of
substantial
compliance
with
a
30
day
time
limit.
thirty-one
days
is
not
30
days.
otherwise,
you
can't
have
any
time
limits.
is
35
substantial?
is
45?
it
seems
to
me
substantial
compliance
with
30
days
is
30
days.
justice
scalia
that
could
happen
to
anybody
no
matter
how
literate
you
are.
i
mean,
that
is
not
a
function
of
his
lack
of
intellect.
justice
scalia
twenty
miles
a
day
for
the
delivery.
you
really
think
four
days
is
a
whole
lot
of
time?
i
mean,
an
extraordinary
amount
of
time
to
get
a
letter
delivered?
justice
scalia
yeah.
even
in
the
same
metropolitan
area.
are
you
always
sure
that
the
letter
you
mailed
will
get
there
in
four
days?
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
four
days
is
reasonable.
i
wouldn't
trust
four
days.
if
i
knew
i
wasn't
going
to
make
a
phone
call
or
anything
else,
i'd
be
sure
to
get
it
in
the
mailbox
more
than
four
days
before.
wouldn't
you?
justice
scalia
should
that
make
the
difference?
you
can
always
say
that.
everytime
someone
doesn't
know
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure
we
can
just
say,
well,
that's--
justice
scalia
--so
then
that's
irrelevant.
justice
scalia
every
non-lawyer,
we
can't
hold
them
to
the
30
days.
justice
scalia
okay.
that's
a
different
issue
from
whether
he
knows
the
30
days
or
not.
justice
scalia
we
can
hold
him
to
knowing
the
30
days
period,
can't
we?
do
we
have
to
examine
each
individual
litigant
to
see
whether
he
is
unlettered
enough
to
know
the
30
days?
justice
scalia
you
might
not
even
need
fallen.
you
might
have
a
due
process
objection
if
that
were
the
case.
justice
scalia
plus
the
thing
gets
there
one
day
after
the
extended
deadline.
i
mean,
you
are--
justice
scalia
--just
postponing
the
evil
day,
aren't
you?
justice
scalia
even
if
you
give
him
another
30
days,
it
is
going
to
come
one
day
after
the
extended
30
days.
justice
scalia
it
would
also
save
us
from
dealing
with
the
million
variations
to
determine
just
what
has
to
be
done
to
comply.
justice
scalia
at
least
he's
unlettered,
general
smith.
you
are
not
expecting
him
to
know
about
the
60
day,
are
you?
justice
scalia
you
are
right.
