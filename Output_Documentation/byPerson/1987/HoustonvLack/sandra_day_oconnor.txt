justice
o'connor
well,
isn't
there
a
statute
here
that
we
have
to
come
to
grips
with,
and
there
wasn't
for
the
direct
appeal?
justice
o'connor
ms.
white,
was
that
argument
made
below?
justice
o'connor
this
is
the
first
time
that
we...
anyone
has
heard
that?
justice
o'connor
and
you
didn't
make
the
argument
about...
that
it
might
have
been
received
in
the
post
office?
justice
o'connor
mr.
smith,
in
this
case
the
district
court
issued
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
i
guess,
and
the
court
of
appeals
sent
out
a
briefing
schedule?
justice
o'connor
and
what
was
the
timing
of
those
two
actions?
was
that
within
the
60
day
period
that
the
motion
to
extend
could
have
been
filed?
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
that
doesn't
fit
within
the
thompson
unique
circumstances
that
the
petitioner
might
have
thought
by
virtue
of
those
two
things
reasonably
that
the
appeal
had
been
received
on
time,
the
notice
of
appeal?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
court
of
appeals
had
issued
a
briefing
schedule,
i
thought.
justice
o'connor
within
the
60
day
period?
justice
o'connor
and
if
the
papers
had
been
given
four
days
before
the
expiration
of
the
30
day
filing
period
to
the
warden,
and
then
you
got
all
those
things,
i
just
wonder
if
that
couldn't
qualify?
justice
o'connor
under
thompson
as
unique
circumstance.
justice
o'connor
but
it
does
seem
that
when
one
is
dealing
with
notices
of
appeal
from
pro
se
petitioners
in
prison,
that
it
would
be
the
most
desirable
practice
if
the
district
court
on
receipt
of
it
would
indicate
to
the
petitioner
that
it
was
not
timely
filed,
or
if
some
action
were
taken
other
than
one
that
could
be
thought
to
lull
them
into
a
sense
of
security
about
it.
i
just
wonder
if
we
are
dealing
fairly
with
people
in
these
circumstances.
