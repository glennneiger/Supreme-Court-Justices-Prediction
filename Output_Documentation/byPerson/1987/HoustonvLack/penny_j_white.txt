ms.
penny
j.
white
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
prentiss
houston,
a
pro
se
inmate,
gave
his
notice
of
appeal
in
a
brief
to
prison
authorities
for
mailing
on
february
3,
1986.
those
documents
were
stamp
filed
at
the
clerk's
office
some
81
miles
away
on
february
7th,
which
happened
to
be
30
days
and
eight
and
one
half
hours
after
entry
of
the
order
denying
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
not
until
march
21st,
when
the
sixth
circuit
entered
an
order
directing
houston
to
show
cause
why
his
appeal
should
not
be
dismissed,
did
he
learn
of
his
untimeliness.
after
receiving
his
reasons
for
delay,
and
being
directed
to
this
court's
authority
in
fallen
v.
united
states,
the
sixth
circuit
appointed
counsel,
and
directed
counsel
as
one
of
the
issues
to
be
briefed
to
consider
the
applicability
of
fallen
to
the
case
before
it.
having
been
appointed
by
that
court
to
brief
the
issue
of
jurisdiction,
as
well
as
the
merits
of
the
case,
which
were
noted
to
be
a
first
impression
in
the
district,
and
having
urged
that
court
to
allow
mr.
houston's
appeal
under
rule
4(a)(5),
or
under
the
precedent
of
fallen
v.
united
states,
and
having
been
told
by
that
court
summarily
from
the
bench
in
open
court
that
they
were
without
jurisdiction,
and
that
fallen
was
of
no
help
to
the
petitioner,
we
apply
to
this
court
for
relief
from
that
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
we
submit
is
plainly
wrong.
that
judgment
is
plainly
wrong
for
four
reasons.
two
of
those
reasons
require
reversal
of
the
sixth
circuit
order,
and
a
consideration
by
the
sixth
circuit
on
the
merits.
the
other
two
issues,
at
the
very
least,
require
remand
for
consideration
of
rule
4(a)(5),
or
for
consideration
of
when
mr.
houston's
notice
was
actually
received.
i
will
address
the
issues
in
that
order.
first,
turning
to
the
precedent
of
fallen
v.
united
states,
almost
25
years
ago
this
court
recognized
in
the
pro
se
petitioner
aspect
that
when
a
prisoner
does
all
that
he
reasonably
can
do
to
affect
a
timely
appeal,
that
his
appeal
should
be
heard.
in
the
words
of
this
court,
the
rules
are
not,
and
were
not,
intended
to
be
a
rigid
code,
to
have
an
inflexible
meaning
irrespective
of
the
circumstances.
ms.
penny
j.
white
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
correct,
but,
in
fact,
that
proposition,
that
quote,
in
fallen
v.
united
states,
was
quoted
by
the
advisory
committee
to
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
particularly
under
rule
3.
it
was
quoted
in
conjunction
with
four
other
cases,
one
of
which
was
a
civil
case,
and
in
conjunction
with
coppedge
v.
united
states,
which
in
its
footnote
refers
to
either
2255
and
2254
petitions.
we
suggest
that
what
the
court
focused
on
and
found
was
not
the
nature
of
the
case,
but
the
nature
of
the
rules.
the
state,
in
fact,
urges
you
to
distinguish
fallen
based
on
the
fact
that
it
was
a
criminal
case,
and
a
direct
appeal.
as
the
court
has
pointed
out,
that
is
a
factual
difference.
it
is
a
distinction
that
does
not
make
a
difference.
in
fallen--
ms.
penny
j.
white
--justice
o'connor,
the
state
points
out
that
20
usc
sec.
2107
is
a
statute
that
says
that
in
civil
cases
an
appeal
must
be
brought
within
30
days.
quite
frankly,
the
point
i
am
about
to
address
is
not
adequately
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
and
i
think
it
is
of
significant
importance.
the
state
relies
on
that
statute
for
its
argument
that
time
limits
are
jurisdictional.
that
statute
says
that
an
appeal
must
be
filed
within
30
days.
as
this
court
recognized
in
shack
v.
united
states,
when
we
were
dealing
with
court
rules,
and
not
statutes,
court
rules
aren't
jurisdictional.
the
meaning
of
the
word
file
does
not
come
from
a
promulgation
of
congress.
it
comes
from
rule
25
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
in
fact,
rule
25
says
that
papers
must
be
filed
by
receipt,
but
briefs
may
be
filed
by
mailing.
it
is
a
cruel
irony
in
this
case
that
mr.
houston
mailed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
a
brief
on
the
same
day.
his
brief,
i
suggest
to
you,
was
filed
the
day
he
mailed
it.
his
notice
of
appeal
under
rule
25
was
filed
the
day
the
clerk
stamped
it
as
received.
it
is
also
a
cruel
irony
that
had
mr.
houston
been
petitioning
this
court
for
certiorari
mailing,
would
have
been
filing.
so
i
suggest--
ms.
penny
j.
white
--that's
an
interesting
question.
certainly
rule
28.02
says
he'd
have
to
have
a
certificate
from
a
practicing
member
of
this
court,
but
i
would
suggest
that's
an
interesting
equal
protection
problem
there
if
the
inmate
would
not
be
allowed
to
proceed
that
way.
ms.
penny
j.
white
i
think
that
that
is
illustrated
greatly
by
this
case.
the
point
is
that
mr.
houston
filed
a
brief,
which
conforms
with
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure
requirement
of
what
a
notice
of
appeal
is.
his
brief
on
the
cover
said
he
was
appealing
from
the
united
states
district
court
to
the
united
states
district
court
of
appeals,
which
in
his
pro
se
language
was
what
the
court
was.
it
also
stated
the
names
of
the
parties.
that
brief
was
filed
the
day
it
was
mailed;
however,
his
notice
of
appeal
which
accompanied
it,
which
was
filed
the
day
it
was
received,
was
not
received
until
eight
and
a
half
hours
too
late.
as
this
court
recognized
in
fallen,
when
a
pro
se
inmate
does
all
that
he
reasonably
can
do
under
the
circumstances,
perhaps
mailing
should
be
filing.
at
least
two
members
of
this
court,
justice
brennan
and
blackmun,
recognize
that
in
those
situations
prison
authority
should
be
the
clerk,
because
look
at
the
situation
we
have.
mr.
houston
has
to
rely
on
his
adversary
to
note
his
appeal.
once
he
goes
to
prison
authorities
and
hands
over
that
appeal,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
else
he
can
do
to
make
sure
it
gets
there.
ms.
penny
j.
white
i
suggest
that
is
one
thing
that
the
court
could
do,
and
since
those
are
rules
that
are
to
be
applied
with
elasticity,
and
rules
written
and
approved
by
this
court,
the
court
can
do
that.
ms.
penny
j.
white
justice
warren
wrote
the
opinion,
chief
justice
warren,
but
there
was
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
the
mailbox
rule
was
proposed.
there
were
four
justices
that
joined
in
that.
ms.
penny
j.
white
a
number
of
cases
have
recognized
that
reliance
upon
normal
delivery
of
mail
is
excusable
neglect,
is
good
reliance,
and,
in
fact,
i
think
what
the
court
would
have
to
determine
is
what
is
reasonable.
if
he
put
it
in
the
mail
on
the
last
day
perhaps
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
it
to
get
there.
of
course,
in
this
case
it
only
had
to
travel
81
miles.
but
there
are
numerous
cases,
even
where
attorneys
wait
too
late
to
mail,
that
the
court
said
that
reasonable
reliance
on
the
mail
is
sufficient
to
allow
an
untimely
appeal.
ms.
penny
j.
white
the
jurisdiction
aspect
of
it
is
only
filing.
what
is
filing
is
created
by
court
rule,
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
unique
circumstances
line
of
cases,
and
in
other
cases,
that
equitable
totaling
may
occur,
so
that
actual
receipt
is
not
required.
for
example,
about
three
years
ago
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
lack,
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
federal
land
mining
claim,
which
had
to
be
filed
on
a
certain
day,
could
be
filed
a
day
late,
and
justice
marshall
noted
that,
in
fact,
that
was
a
statute,
and
there
could
be
no
late
filing.
however,
the
doctrine
of
equitable
estoppel
was
recognized
in
his
opinion,
and
in
a
concurring
opinion
of
justice
o'connor,
and
that-case
was
directed
back
for
remand
to
determine
whether
or
not
estoppel
was
appropriate.
ms.
penny
j.
white
if
i
understand
your
question,
i
do
think
that
the
simplest
way
to
cure
the
matter
would
be
to
define
filing
for
all
papers
in
the
circuit
court
as
occurring
upon
the
same
act.
we
are
dealing
with
a
pro
se
inmate
who
mailed
a
brief,
and
a
notice
of
appeal,
on
the
same
day.
the
rule
tells
him
that
papers
must
be
received,
but
that
briefs
must
be
mailed
in
order
to
be
timely.
to
a
pro
se
inmate
the
fact
that
one
of
his
documents
was
called
a
brief
may
not
have
indicated
to
him
that
his
other
document
came
under
that
definition
of
papers.
ms.
penny
j.
white
yes,
sir,
i
understand
that
reservation,
justice
scalia,
but
we
don't
have
that
case
before
the
court.
we
have
a
notice
of
appeal
that
arrived.
ms.
penny
j.
white
i
am
not
suggesting
that
that
rule
is
the
only
way
the
court
can
go.
i'm
suggesting
that
at
least
four
members
of
this
court
thought
that
that
was
the
way
to
go
in
1964
in
the
case
of
fallen.
there
are
other
means
by
which
this
court
can
allow
mr.
houston's
appeal
to
be
heard.
one
of
those
is
present
in
a
line
of
cases
from
this
court
beginning
with
harris
truck
lines,
and
concluding
with
two
ins
cases,
thompson
and
wolfsohn.
those
cases
recognize
that
when
a
litigant,
and
may
i
suggest
that
in
all
three
of
those
cases
we
were
dealing
with
a
litigant
represented
by
a
lawyer,
when
a
litigant
detrimentally
relies
on
some
action
of
the
district
court,
and
doesn't
timely
note
his
appeal,
then
his
appeal
should
be
deemed
timely.
in
this
case
what
happened
between
the
day
mr.
houston
presented
his
notice
for
mailing,
and
march
21st,
is
that
mr.
houston
received
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
from
the
district
judge;
he
received
a
briefing
schedule
from
the
court
of
appeals;
and
he
received
a
correspondence
that
required
him
to
designate
parts
of
his
record.
he
did
all
of
that,
thinking,
as
a
pro
se
inmate
would,
that
things
were
proceeding
normally
with
the
appeal.
it
was
not
until
sometime
after
march
21st,
long
after
any
time
had
expired
within
which
he
could
do
something
about
his
lateness,
that
anyone
bothered
to
tell
him
he
was
late.
ms.
penny
j.
white
you're
absolutely
correct
in
the
case
of
harris
truck
lines.
in
that
case
the
appellant's
attorney
was
out
vacationing,
and
the
lawyer
asked
the
district
judge
to
allow
him
to
file
his
appeal
late
after
the
attorney
returned
from
vacation,
and
the
judge
said,
"yes,
you
may
file
a
late
appeal.
"
in
that
case
the
judge
did
say
something
in
order
to
make
those
parties
detrimentally
rely.
however,
in
the
case
of
thompson
and
wolfsohn,
what
happened
particularly
in
thompson
is
that
the
litigant
filed
a
tolling
motion,
a
rule
52
or
rule
59
motion,
too
late,
and
the
judge
heard
the
motion,
and
the
other
party,
the
government,
did
not
raise
the
lateness,
and
so
then
when
the
appeal
was
perfected
the
court
of
appeals
threw
it
out
and
said
your
first
motion
didn't
toll
because
it
was
two
days
beyond
the
ten
day
limit.
so
in
that
case
certainly
the
district
judge
did
not
extend
the
appeal
time.
in
fact,
the
lawyers
detrimentally
relied
on
their
own
ignorance,
yet
this
court
said
in
those
circumstances
it
would
be
unfair
to
deny
them
an
appeal.
certainly
i
would
agree
that
a
lawyer
who
received
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
or
a
briefing
schedule,
would
not
detrimentally
rely
upon
that,
but
we
are
dealing
with
an
unskilled
inmate,
a
person
who
this
court
has
called
an
unlettered
prisoner
without
friends
or
funds.
we
are
not
dealing
with
someone
who
understands
what
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
is.
ms.
penny
j.
white
absolutely.
ms.
penny
j.
white
absolutely.
i
think
that
he
is
not
required
to
conform
with
the
letter
the
way
that
other
litigants
are.
i
think
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
that,
particularly
in
the
habeas
corpus
area
where
we
are
dealing
with
the
great
writ,
the
writ
that
holds
the
key
to
the
prison
doors.
this
court
has
said
in
harrison
v.
nelson,
the
kerner
case,
and
a
couple
of
other
habeas
corpus
cases
whose
names
escape
me
at
the
moment,
that
pro
se
inmates
are
not
to
be
held
to
the
same
level
of
expertise
and
skill.
ms.
penny
j.
white
that's
true
that
the
kerner
case
dealt
with
the
12(b)(6)
dismissal
of
a
complaint,
and
the
court
said
we
don't
hold
pro
se
inmates
at
the
same
level.
but,
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
the
cases
of
price
v.
johnston;
holiday
v.
johnston;
and
darr
v.
burford,
in
which
the
court
recognized
the
general
principle
that
when
we
deal
with
pro
se
inmates
we
are
dealing
with
unskilled
inmates,
or
unskilled
litigants,
who
we
cannot
hold
to
the
same
level
of
skill.
ms.
penny
j.
white
i
would
suggest
that
this
court--
ms.
penny
j.
white
--sir,
none
of
those
cases
dealt
directly
with
applying...
with
complying
with
an
appellate
rule,
but
this
court
said
that
when
it
approved
rule
of
appellate
procedure
7,
i
believe
it
is,
in
which
it
says
"a
notice
of
appeal
will
not
be
thrown
out
because
it
doesn't
conform
with
the
requirements
of
this
rule
so
long
as
it
substantially
complies.
"
i
would
suggest
that
that
rule,
and
of
course,
as
well,
the
rules
governing
habeas
corpus
in
general,
suggest
that
this
court
does
take
a
different
look
at
pro
se
papers.
ms.
penny
j.
white
in
regards
to
your
first
point,
i
think
if
you
would
indulge
me,
we
are
assuming
that
petitioner
houston
knew
that
it
was
30
days.
i
would
suggest
that
what
petitioner
houston
had
to
do
was
first
find
out
if
it
was
30
days,
which
would
certainly
be
a
simple
matter
for
you
or
i
to
go
to
a
rule
book
and
look
it
up,
but
we
are
dealing
with
a
person
who
is
not
familiar
with
rule
books.
he
first
had
to
determine
whether
it
was
30
days.
and
then
he
reads
rule
3
and
it
says
"notice
of
appeal
shall
be
filed
within
30
days.
"
and
then
he
goes
to
rule
25,
and
rule
25
says
filing
means
mailing.
if
it's
a
brief
or
an
appendices,
filing
means
receipt
if
it's
a
paper.
and
the
most
crucial
point
is
he
mailed
the
document,
he
delivered
it
to
his
custodian,
within
time
to
meet
any
one
of
those
rules.
he
gave
it
to
the
custodian
four
days
before
it
had
to
travel
81
miles,
yet
it
did
not
get
there.
ms.
penny
j.
white
but
when
it
happens
to
me,
when
i
mail
on
the
27th
day,
i
can
call
the
clerk,
i
can
travel
to
the
clerk's
office
to
make
sure
it
got
there.
mr.
houston
could
do
absolutely
nothing
else
but
give
that
to
his
adversary
and
say
"mail
it".
and
to
suggest
that
we
don't
have
some
sort
of
solicitude
in
that
situation
suggests
that
the
adversaries
of
pro
se
inmates
can,
in
effect,
make
sure
there
are
never
any
appeals.
ms.
penny
j.
white
yes,
sir,
they
may
have
quite
a
bit
of
experience
in
counting
the
days.
they
have
to
know
where
to
count
from,
and
where
it
has
to
be
on
that
30th
day.
ms.
penny
j.
white
that's
exactly
what
he
did
in
this
case.
he
gave
it
to
the
jail
authority.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
the
event
the
court
is
hesitant
to
apply
fallen
to
these
circumstances,
which
we
suggest
applies,
and
in
the
event
the
court
is
hesitant
to
apply
the
unique
circumstances
line
of
cases,
that
the
rules
themselves
allow
this
court
to
determine
that
mr.
houston's
appeal
was
timely
filed
for
two
reasons.
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
rule
4(a)(5)
says
that
an
appeal
can
be
extended.
the
district
court
can
grant
an
extension
for
up
to
30
days
because
of
good
cause
or
excusable
neglect.
now,
prior
to
1979
every
single
time
that
a
pro
se
inmate's
notice
of
appeal
occurred
in
that
second
30
days,
he
was...
it
was
interpreted
to
be
a
motion
for
an
extension
of
time,
and
if,
in
fact,
there
was
excusable
neglect
prior
to
1979,
it
was
allowed
even
though
it
occurred
in
the
second
30
days.
in
1979
the
rules
were
amended,
and
the
rules
were
amended
for
three
reasons,
none
of
which
deal
with
this
act.
judge
friendly,
in
the
case
of
inre
orbitec,
had
found
a
problem
with
occurs
when
you
ask
for
an
extension
of
time
within
the
30
days,
but
don't
get
your
order
within
the
30
days.
so
that
was
one
reason
that
the
rules
were
amended
to
allow
you
to...
to
allow
a
district
judge
to
extend
the
time
up
to
ten
days
beyond
his
order.
the
second
reason
that
the
rules
were
amended
was
to
add
a
good
cause
allowance
so
that
if
an
inmate...
or,
excuse
me,
if
any
litigant
had
good
cause
they
could
ask
for
an
extension
regardless
of
whether
it
was
excusable
neglect.
the
third
reason
that
the
rules
were
amended
was
to
require
a
motion
to
be
filed
for
request
in
the
first
30
days.
from
the
time
the
rules
were
implemented
until
today,
a
motion
has
always
been
required
for
request
in
the
second
30
day
period.
yet,
since
1979
the
circuits
who
have
dealt
with
it,
with
the
exception
of
one
circuit,
has
said
now
you
can
no
longer
treat
the
late
filed
notice
as
a
motion.
you
must
have
a
specific
motion.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
judge
hainsworth
in
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
of
shah
v.
hutto,
correctly
viewed
this
problem.
that
change
in
the
rule
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
situation
of
a
motion
in
the
second
30
days.
so
when
mr.
houston
sent
his
notice
of
appeal,
he
certainly
implied
he
meant
he
wanted
to
appeal,
and
he
wanted
to
do
anything
necessary
to
appeal.
the
court
received
it,
gave
him
absolutely
no
notice
that
it
was
late,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
two
years
earlier
the
sixth
circuit
had
said
"you
clerks
ought
to
give
notice
when
these
pro
se
inmates
are
late.
"
gave
no
notice.
he
knew
nothing
about
the
situation
until
the
second
30
days
had
expired,
and
he
could
not
make
a
motion.
i
would
suggest
that
the
proper
construction
of
rule
4(a)(5)
is
to
treat
that
notice
as
a
motion,
just
as
it
had
been
done
for
countless
years
prior
to
1979.
i
would
suggest
that
the
changes
do
not
affect
that
second
30
day
requirement
at
all.
ms.
penny
j.
white
no,
sir,
you
do
not.
what
you
know
is
that
the
prison
authorities
logged
in
mr.
houston's
mail
on
february
3rd.
that's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
28.
we
don't
know
when
it
was
mailed.
ms.
penny
j.
white
correct,
which
is
another
interesting
point,
and
it's
actually
my
last
point.
the
district
court
logged
that
in
at
8:30
a.m.
on
february
7th.
every
paper
of
mr.
houston
which
arrived
at
the
district
court,
was
logged
in
at
either
8:00
a.m.,
or
8:30
a.m..
the
district
court
occupies
a
post
office
building,
and
has
a
post
office
box.
the
circumstances
at
least
suggest
should
this
court
be
unable
on
the
facts,
or
unable
under
the
law
to
allow
mr.
houston's
appeal,
the
circumstances
at
least
suggest
at
a
minimum
that
mr.
houston
is
entitled
to
a
remand
to
determine
when
that
letter...
notice,
excuse
me...
was
actually
received.
ms.

j.

eighty-one
miles.
ms.
penny
j.
white
in
a
post
office?
ms.
penny
j.
white
no,
i'm
not
always
sure,
but
i
can
pick
up
the
phone
and
call,
and
i
can
go
down
and
see
if
it
got
there.
i
would
suggest
that
81
days
is
supposedly
next
day
delivery
with
the
post
office
that
proclaims
next
day
delivery
within
100
miles,
and
nonetheless,
it
got
there
a
day
late.
now,
the
state
is
going
to
suggest
to
you
that
he
put
the
wrong
address
on
it.
regardless--
ms.
penny
j.
white
--we
don't
know
that
either.
we
don't
know
what...
where
it
went...
we
don't
know
when
it
left,
or
where
it
went,
between
the
time
it
left,
and
the
time
it
arrived.
ms.
penny
j.
white
i'm
suggesting
there's
enough
of
a
possibility
there
to
entitle
this
litigant
to
a
remand
if
the
court
cannot
find
timely
filing
on
any
other
basis.
ms.
penny
j.
white
no,
ma'am,
it
was
not.
ms.
penny
j.
white
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
none
of
these
arguments
were
made
below.
none
of
these
arguments
were
made
below
because
what
happened
is
the
sixth
circuit
assumed
jurisdiction
over
the
jurisdiction
issue,
appointed
me
to
represent
mr.
houston,
and
said
"brief
jurisdiction,
and
brief
the
merits.
"
i
arrived
in
the
sixth
circuit
for
oral
argument
having
briefed
jurisdiction
on
these
arguments
of
fallen
in
rule
4(a)(5),
and
the
sixth
circuit
under
rule
16
of
their
procedures.
sua
sponte
from
the
bench
dismissed
the
appeal.
ms.
penny
j.
white
you
are
absolutely
correct,
i
did
not.
i
did
not
at
that
point
in
time.
it
is
our
position
that
in
a
situation
where
we
are
dealing
with
a
pro
se
inmate
who
does
all
that
he
can
do,
who
substantially
complies
with
the
rules,
who,
in
fact,
detrimentally
relies
on
the
action
of
a
district
judge,
or
of
a
district
court,
more
correctly,
and
who,
in
fact,
may
have
gotten
his
appeal
there
timely
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
that
his
day
in
court
should
not
be
taken
from
him.
ms.
penny
j.
white
no,
sir,
not
exactly,
because
if
he
put
it
in
a
mailbox
that
was
not
a
functioning
mailbox,
i
certainly
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument.
ms.
penny
j.
white
i'd
like
to
respond
in
two
ways.
fortunately
we
don't
have
to
bank
on
that
in
this
case
because
he
logged
it
in,
and
the
prison
authorities
did
that,
and--
ms.
penny
j.
white
--yes,
sir.
ms.
penny
j.
white
that's
correct.
ms.
penny
j.
white
if
under
the
circumstances
of
dropping
it
in
the
mailbox
he
did
all
he
reasonably
could
do
under
the
circumstances,
then,
yes,
that
appeal
would
be
timely.
ms.
penny
j.
white
you
wouldn't
because
you
would
have
known
the
30
days.
you
would
have
known
exactly
what
to
do.
in
this
situation
we
have
an
inmate
who
is
in
an
institution,
whose
library
has
been
destroyed
by
a
riot,
who
has
moved
from
that
institution
to
another
institution
during
the
first
week,
and
during
that
period
he
is
placed
in
an
orientation
where
he
is
busy
six
days
a
week
and
unable
to
get
to
the
library,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
can
assume
he
knew
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
ms.
penny
j.
white
we
expect
that
of
lawyers.
ms.
penny
j.
white
no,
it's
not
irrelevant.
ms.
penny
j.
white
no,
sir,
every
pro
se
inmate
who
does
everything
he
reasonably
can
do
under
the
circumstances
to
timely
note
his
appeal
should
have
his
day
in
court.
ms.
penny
j.
white
it
is
different.
ms.
penny
j.
white
not
if
you
rule
that
a
late
filed
notice
is
a
motion
for
extension
of
time,
you
certainly
do
not.
but
if
the
case
of
fallen
v.
united
states
is
the
basis
for
this
court's
decision,
then
that
is
by
its
nature
a
factual
inquiry,
and
it
requires
the
court
to
look
at
the
facts.
may
i
reserve,
if
there
are
no
questions,
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal?
ms.

counsel
faults
petitioner
and
his
appointed
counsel
for
not
filing
a
rule
60
motion
in
a
situation
when
the
sixth
circuit
in
its
order
joint
appendix
29
had
assumed
jurisdiction
over
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
counsel
would
have
had
counsel
for
the
petitioner
go
to
another
form
while
the
sixth
circuit
had
before
it
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
in
order
to
file
rule
60?
counsel
has
misspoken
to
this
court
when
he
says
that
the
nine
circuits
who
have
considered
the...
treating
a
late
filed
notice
as
a
motion
of
appeal
have
ruled
against
it.
six
circuits,
your
honors,
six
circuits,
have
said
we
either
have
a
rule,
or
a
form
that
we
send
to
late
pro
se
inmates,
or
we
should
be
doing
that.
in
one
circuit,
the
second
circuit,
in
the
case
of
fearon,
1985,
totally
went
against
the
majority
of
the
circuits,
and
declared
a
late
file
notice
of
appeal
to
the
motion.
i
would
suggest
that
the
state's
argument
that
thompson
is
no
longer
valid
law
flies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
decisions,
which
he
cites
lack,
browder,
and
griggs.
in
browder,
the
case
which
he
suggests
overrules
thompson,
this
court
cited
thompson
for
its
continued
validity
in
the
proposition
that
rule
52
and
59
motions
are
permissible
in
habeas
cases.
in
neither
griggs
nor
lack
were
any
of
those
three
cases,
thompson,
wolfsohn,
or
harris
truck
lines,
mentioned.
so
to
imply,
as
the
state
has,
that
those
cases
have
no
validity,
when
this
court
has
cited
them
with
approval,
and
not
explicitly
overruled
them,
i
would
suggest
is
an
improper
implication.
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
opinion
that
finality
will
never
occur
if
mr.
houston
is
given
his
day
in
court.
if
we
want
to
see
a
lack
of
finality,
then
tell
pro
se
inmates
to
file
a
rule
60
motion.
this
court
in
ackerman
v.
united
states
has
said
that
a
rule
60
motion
is
not
a
substitute
for
an
appeal.
what
we
had
in
this
case
was
something
filed
within
the
additional
30
days
which
this
court
has
seen
fit
to
extend
the
appeal
time
beyond
that
30
days
to
60
days.
we
had
something
filed
within
that
time;
we
had
a
pro
se
inmate
load--
