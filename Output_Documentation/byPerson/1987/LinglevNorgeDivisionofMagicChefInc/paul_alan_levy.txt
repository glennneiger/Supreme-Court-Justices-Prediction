mr.
paul
alan
levy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
under
illinois
law
as
in
approximately
two-thirds
of
the
states
an
employer
may
not
fire
an
employee
for
seeking
workers'
compensation
benefits,
and
an
employee
who
is
thus
victimized
may
seek
redress
in
the
state
courts.
the
reason
why
illinois
provides
this
cause
of
action
is
that
it
doesn't
want
employees
to
be
discouraged
from
seeking
workers'
compensation
benefits
by
the
risk
that
they
will
be
discharged
from
their
employment.
next
illinois
had
to
decide
whether
an
employee
loses
those
rights
by
going
to
work
in
a
shop
which
is
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
illinois
supreme
court
held,
no,
you
don't
lose
those
rights;
rather,
the
right
of
action
is
available
to
union
and
non-union
employees
alike,
and
again
illinois
in
this
respect
is
in
accord
with
the
majority
of
state
courts
that
have
considered
the
question,
at
least
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
has
deprived
the
state
of
illinois
of
the
right
to
make
this
judgment
by
passing
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
which
provides
a
means
for
the
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements,
or
by
passing
section
203
of
that
same
act,
which
enunciates
a
national
policy
favoring
abitral
resolution
of
disputes
about
the
application
or
interpretation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
although
the
court
has
held
that
congress
intended
to
supersede
state
laws
providing
for
the
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements,
there
is
no
basis
for
concluding
that
congress
also
intended
these
statutes
to
supersede
state
substantive
regulation
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
in
work
places
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements.
given
the
presumption
against
preemption
of
state
law
claims,
the
burden
is
on
respondent
to
show
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
preempt
the
type
of
claim
at
stake
here.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history
suggesting
that
congress
wanted
to
preclude
state
regulation
of
the
substantive
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
indeed,
to
the
extent
that
the
language
provides
any
guidance
at
all,
it
is
actually
helpful
to
our
case
because
the
statute
speaks
only
of
suits
for
violations
of
contracts,
and
suits
or
a
policy
concerning
the
application
and
interpretation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
court
below
nevertheless
held
that
lingle's
claim
was
preempted.
the
case
on
which
it
relied
and
on
which
respondents
principally
relied
below
was
alice
chalmers
versus
lueck.
in
our
view,
not
only
does
alice
chalmers
not
help
respondents,
but
to
the
contrary
it
is
strong
authority
against
preemption.
in
alice
chalmers
the
court
held
that
section
301
preempts
an
employee's
tort
claim
for
bad
faith
denial
of
contractual
rights.
in
order
to
rule
on
that
claim,
the
court
reasoned,
it
would
inevitably
be
necessary
to
define
the
employee's
contract
rights,
to
decide
whether
they
had
been
denied,
whether
they
had
been
denied
in
bad
faith,
and
what
consequences
should
show
from
that
denial
of
contractual
rights.
thus
the
court
said
in
order
to...
that
state
law
claim
is
substantially
dependent
on
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
allowing
that
sort
of
state
claim
to
proceed
would
interfere
with
a
policy
favoring
uniform
interpretation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
under
principles
of
federal
law
by
arbitrators
selected
by
the
parties.
here,
however,
the
state
has
conferred
a
non-negotiable
right
on
individual
employees,
the
right
not
to
be
discharged
in
retaliation
for
making
a
workers'
compensation
claim.
that
cause
of
action
is
independent
of
rights
which
may
be
enjoyed
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
there
is
a
right
under
the
collective
bargaining--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--which
was
vindicated.
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
the
arbitrator
found
that
there
was
not
just
cause
for
discharge
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
that
is
correct.
at
most
the
statutory
and
collectively
bargained
rights
are
parallel,
but
that
is
not
enough
to
preclude
the
employee's
right
to
go
forward
in
state
court.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
the
arbitrator
gave
reinstatement.
the
arbitrator
gave
the
amount
of
back
pay
which
was
allowed
by
the
contract,
which
was
less
than
ms.
lingle's
actual
earnings.
ms.
lingle
was
not
awarded
punitive
damages
to
which
she
might
be
entitled
under
state
law,
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
i
assume
that
state
law
would
provide
for
some
sort
of
a
setoff
for
interim
income,
and
presumably
interim
income
includes
any
back
pay
that
was
awarded
by
the
arbitrator.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
unemployment
compensation
as
well.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
if
the
state
court
action
went
first
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
arbitrate.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
i
don't
know
whether
the
employer--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--in
this
state
court
action
it
will
certainly
not
be
necessary,
not
only
because
there
has
already
been
an
arbitral
ruling,
but
also
because
the
defense
that
has
been
raised
by
the
company
to
the
state
law
claim
is
that
she
filed
a
false
claim,
and
whether
or
not
it
is
necessary...
whether
or
not
that
is
a
sufficient
defense
under
a
state
law,
one
can
decide
whether
it
is
a
false
claim
without
looking
at
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
either
she
was
injured
or
she
wasn't.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
then
i
would
say
that...
the
illinois
state
courts
haven't
yet
decided--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--i
think
that
just
as
one
can
relitigate
the
cause
of
action--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--yes,
you
can,
just
as
you
can
relitigate
the
cause
of
action
with
respect
to
an
independent
federal
claim,
for
example,
under
title
vii,
as
the
court
held
in
gardner-denver,
just
as
one
can
relitigate
the
fair
labor
standards
act
claim,
as
the
court--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--let
me
step
back
a
moment,
because
in
using
the
word
"relitigate"
the
claim
i
think
i
conceded
a
bit
too
much.
she
has
a
state
law
claim
and
she
has
a
contract
claim.
and
there
may
be
some
common
facts,
but
the
state
law
claim
has
not
in
fact
been
resolved
in
the
arbitration.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
i
don't
know.
illinois
hasn't
reached
that
question.
in
fact,
in
the--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--in
gonzalez
v.
prestress--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--i
would
say
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
state
courts
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
decide
whether
to
adopt
the
same
approach
that
this
court
has
adopted
in
gardner-denver.
i
would
note
that
the
state
courts
have
cited
gardner-denver,
the
illinois
courts
have
cited
gardner-denver
in
their
reasoning
in
this
line
of
cases.
it
may
well
be
that
the
employer
would
make
an
effective
argument
that
you
should
give
the
arbitral
determination
great
weight,
assuming
that
the
conditions
set
forth
in
gardner-denver
are
met.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
i--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--yes,
i
understand.
then
the
question
would
be
presented
whether
that
factual
determination
as
a
matter
of
state
law
determines
the
outcome
of
the
state
law
suit.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
i
don't...
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
that
the
question
has
ever
come
up
in
the
gardner-denver
type
of
case.
usually--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--if
you
have
two
separate...
two
different
jurisdictions
and
two
separate
claims,
for
example,
in
the
gardner-denver
type...
gardner-denver
was
a
claim
which
was...
went
forward
in
two
different
fora.
it
went
forth
in
arbitration,
and
alexander
lost
in
arbitration,
and
then
this
court
said
he
is
entitled
to
go
forth
in
federal
court.
the
same
thing
was
true
in
barrentine.
barrentine
had
lost
in
the
teamster
version
of
arbitration
and
he
was
permitted
to
go
forward.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
they
didn't
say
disregarded,
but
they
also
didn't
say
it
was
accepted
as
conclusive.
what
the
court
said
was
that
depending
on
the
circumstances
it
might
be
appropriate
to
give
the
abitral
disposition
greater
or
less
weight.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
i
don't
know
whether
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
for
example,
would
govern
an
arbitral
determination
through
section
301.
i
really
just
can't
give
you
a
good
answer
to
the
question.
i'm
sorry.
i
would
say,
however,
that
because
of
the
timeliness
in
filing
a
grievance,
unless
the
arbitration
drags
on
for
a
long
time,
and
i
must
say
sometimes
they
do
as
they
did
in
this
case,
usually
the
arbitration
is
going
to
be
held
first,
if
an
arbitration
is
held
at
all.
i
would
mention
that
many
of
these
grievances
don't
even
get
to
arbitration
because
they
are
disposed
of
somewhere
short
of
that.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
that
is
certainly
not
this
case.
in
any
event,
in
alice
chalmers
the
court
tried
to
distinguish
between
the
contract
based
claims
that
were
at
stake
in
the
lewis
case
and
state
claims
that
are
based
on
substantive
regulation
of
employment,
and
what
the
court
said
in
alice
chalmers,
equally
applicable
here,
we
believe,
is
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
congressional
intent
under
section
301
to
preempt
state
rules
that
proscribe
conduct
or
establish
rights
and
obligations
independent
of
the
labor
agreement,
and
if
there
is
any
state
employment
cause
of
action
which
is
independent
of
the
labor
agreement,
lingle's
claim
ought
to
be
one
of
them.
so,
consistent
with
the
court's
analysis
in
alice
chalmers,
which
has
been
reaffirmed
in
several
cases
since
then,
lingle's
claim
should
not
be
held
to
be
preempted.
indeed,
although
respondent
has
not
pointed
to
any
indication
that
congress
would
want
to
forbid
lawsuits
for
retaliatory
discharge,
there
is
at
least
some
evidence
of
congressional
intent
which
cuts
against
preemption.
congress
has
enacted
numerous
substantive
regulations
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
in
the
private
sector.
in
our
brief
we
have
cited
29
federal
statutes
governing
discharge
alone.
not
only
do
those
forms
of
substantive
regulation
exist
side
by
side
with
rights
which
may
be
granted
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
this
court
has
repeatedly
ruled
in
the
gardner-denver
and
barrentine
line
of
cases
that
employees
may
enforce
their
rights
under
those
statutes,
including
the
right
against
discharge,
independent
of
collectively
bargained
grievance
procedures.
evidently
congress
doesn't
see
this
form
of
regulation
as
inconsistent
with
collective
bargaining
or
as
inconsistent
with
a
national
policy
favoring
arbitration
of
disputes
about
the
interpretation
or
application
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
it
is
true
those
cases
involve
federal
claims
while
this
case
involves
a
state
claim,
but
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
would
want
to
treat
state
claims
differently.
indeed,
this
court
has
treated
them
similarly.
for
example,
in
metropolitan
life
insurance
the
court
cited
barrentine
and
gardner-denver
as
authority
for
the
lack
of
congressional
intent
to
preempt
state
substantive
regulation
of
employment
conditions.
and
in
alice
chalmers,
in
footnote
8
the
court
pointed
to
gardner-denver
as
an
example
of
an
independent
cause
of
action.
now,
in
this
court
respondent
has
relied
for
the
first
time
on
teamsters
v.
oliver
and
similar
cases
which
hold
according
to
respondent
that
the
federal
labor
laws
preempt
any
state
cause
of
action
that
relates
to
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining.
now,
leaving
aside
whether
that
argument,
essentially
based
on
nlra
preemption
as
opposed
to
section
301
preemption,
was
properly
preserved
in
the
court
of
appeals.
for
present
purposes
it
suffices
to
note
that
the
argument
has
been
repeatedly
rejected
by
the
court
in
recent
years,
most
pointedly
in
metropolitan
life
insurance,
where
the
court
said
that
it
would
turn
the
policy
that
animated
the
wagner
act
on
its
head
to
understand
it
to
have
penalized
workers
who
have
chosen
to
join
a
union
by
preventing
them
from
benefitting
from
state
labor
regulations
imposing
minimum
standards
on
non-union
employers.
similarly
in
fort
halifax
and
caterpillar
the
court
rejected
the
same
argument.
indeed,
the
argument
was
rejected
as
long
ago
as
1943
in
the
terminail
railroad
association
case.
the
court
should
not
accept
respondent's
invitation
to
reopen
this
long
settled
question,
but
rather,
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
i
would
say
no,
that
would
certainly
be
a
more
explicit
waiver,
but
then
the
question
is,
can
the
employer
and
the
union
contract
themselves
out
of
the
procedures
provided
by
state
law,
and
i
would
say
no.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
the
federal
arbitration
act
explicitly
excludes
contracts
of
employment--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
and
although...
certainly
in
some
of
the--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--but
the
waiver
in
that
case
at
least
has
been
made
by
the
individual
employee
in
an
individual
contract
of
employment.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
not
with
respect
to
bargaining
away
non-negotiable
rights
that
the
state
has
decided
should
be
non-negotiable.
if
that
were
true,
all
state
rights
could
be
channeled
into
arbitration,
and
although
this
case
may
look
like
a
case
in
which
at
least
you
can
get
some
relief
in
arbitration,
many
cases,
if
an
employee
is
left
only
with
the
duty
of
fair
representation
remedy,
when
the
union
either
doesn't
succeed
in
getting
all
the
employee
wants
or
in
fact
the
union
doesn't
get
anything
for
the
employee,
in
a
lot
of
cases
there
is
not
even
going
to
be
an
arbitration.
the
case
may
be
settled
short
of
arbitration.
the
union
may
decide
that
it
is
against
the
collective
interest
to
go
forward
with
this
particular
claim.
unless
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
going
to
be
vastly
expanded,
at
least
in
this
context
of
state
law
rights,
what
you
are
doing,
the
choice
of
the
forum,
as
the
court
said
in
gardner-denver,
inevitably
affects
the
scope
of
the
substantive
right.
and
what
the
court
would
be
doing
would
be
requiring
the
states
which
have
very
important
policies
which
they
think
can't
be
effectively
implemented
through
the
collective
bargaining
and
collective
grievance
processing
method,
requiring
those
states
to
give
up
their
right
to
have
those
policies
enforced.
whether
or
not
it
is
good
policy
to
do
so,
this
court
has
continually
allowed
the
states
and
held
that
the
states
are
not
preempted
from
regulation
of
the
substantive
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
and
the
effect
of
the
approach
that
is
suggested
by
your
question
would
be
to
do
that.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
it
would
certainly
not
be
preempted
by
section
301.
there
might
be
a
question
about
whether
you
are
imposing
additional
duties--
mr.
paul
alan
levy
--beyond
those
which
8(b)(1)(a)
imposes
on
unions,
and
whether
that
is
somehow
inconsistent
with
the
policy
behind
(8)(b)(1)(a).
mr.
paul
alan
levy
under
section
301,
yes.
mr.
paul
alan
levy
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
i
have
nothing
else
to
say.
