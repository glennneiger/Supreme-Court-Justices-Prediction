justice
scalia
what
about
collateral
estoppel
vice
versa?
do
you
have
any
view
on
whether
the
arbitrator,
if
the
state
court
litigation
had
gone
ahead
first,
would
be
bound
on
that
factual
determination
by
the
state
court
judgment?
justice
scalia
we
usually
don't
go
around
trying
the
same
fact
twice
in
two
separate
proceedings
and
coming
out
different
ways.
justice
scalia
but
did
they
speak
to
whether
any
common
factual
issues
that
had
been
decided
in
one
proceeding
could
be...
that
determination
could
be
disregarded
in
the
other?
justice
scalia
so
you
think
the
arbitrator
might
be
able
to
ignore
the
state
court
judgment
as
to
what
the
facts
were?
i
very
much
doubt
that.
justice
scalia
mr.
levy,
so
i
can
understand
your
position,
i
assume
you
would
say
our
decision
last
term
in
heckler,
which
involved
a
state
statute
that
sought
to
impose
liability
for
breach
of
a
state...
state-imposed
duty
arising
from
the
contractual
relationship
of
a
union
with
the
employees
that
it
represents
through
the
contract
with
the
employer,
you
would
say
that
that
case
would
have
come
out
differently
if
the
state
law
had
simply
read
every
union
shall
have
an
obligation
to
provide
for
the
safety
of
its
employees
on
the
job,
assuming
that
that
law
would
pass
muster
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
justice
scalia
that
the
nlra
doesn't
allow.
justice
scalia
so
the
key
is
simply
whether
the
state
law
springs
into
operation
by
reason
of
the
contract
or
not.
justice
scalia
i
assume
that
would
apply
to
state
minimum
wage
laws.
do
you
consider
that
a
health
and
safety
law?
justice
scalia
they
don't
have
latitude
with
respect
to
workmen's
compensation?
they
couldn't
contract
out
of
that
and
say,
if
you
are
injured
on
the
job
you
just
have
no
remedy,
i
assume.
justice
scalia
but
they
do
have
latitude...
you
see,
you--
justice
scalia
--right.
you
seemingly
don't
regard
this
as
a
workmen's
compensation
law.
you
regard
it
as
a
termination
law?
i
regard
it
as
a
workmen's
compensation
law.
it
is
just
a
means
by
which
the
state
enforces
its
workmen's
compensation
law.
if
you
fire
somebody
for
filing
a
workmen's
compensation
claim,
you
are
going
to
be
liable
for
damages.
don't
you
think
that
is
part
of
the
workmen's
comp
scheme?
