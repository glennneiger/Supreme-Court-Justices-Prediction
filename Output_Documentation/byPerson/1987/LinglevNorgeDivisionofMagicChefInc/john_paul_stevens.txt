justice
stevens
isn't
your
correct
answer
suggested
by
the
chief
justice's
question,
that
what
we
have
is
an
issue
of
preemption,
not
of
collateral
estoppe?
that
is
a
question
that
would
arise
when
you
have
that
happen.
justice
stevens
i
have
a
question.
supposing
the
labor
agreement
was
much
more
particular
than
this
one
is
and
said
specifically
that
claims
such
as
this
arising
out
of
a
discharge
because
of
invoking
the
workmen's
compensation
remedy
shall
be
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure,
and
that
shall
be
the
only
remedy.
on
behalf
of
the
employees
the
union
agrees
that
this
is
the
most
efficient
way
to
dispose
of
these
claims.
would
you
then
find
preemption
or
not?
i
gather
from
your
argument
they
could
not
make
that
agreement.
justice
stevens
i
know
you
have
these
federal
precedents,
but
do
you
have
any
case
holding
that
a
state
law
claim
like
this
cannot
be
waived
by...
we
had
a
case
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
a
couple
of
years
ago
where
they
held
that
an
employee's
claim
of
some
kind,
even
though
california
law
said
it
could
not
be
waived,
the
court
held
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
applied,
and
the
waiver
was
valid,
so
why
wouldn't
the
reasoning
of
that
case
apply
in
the
labor
context
as
well?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
but
my
point
is,
it
seems
to
me
the
policy
favoring
arbitration
in
the
union
context
is
at
least
as
strong
as
the
policy
favoring
arbitration
implemented
by
the
federal
arbitration
act.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
you
certainly
wouldn't
say
that
a
collective
bargaining
agent
doesn't
have
the
same
authority
to
represent
the
individual
employee
in
bargaining
the
terms
of
employment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
first
case,
lingle
against
norge,
which
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
the
petitioner
was
an
employee
who
was
discharged
allegedly
because
she
had
filed
a
false
workers'
compensation
claim.
she
had
two
remedies,
one,
under
her
collective-bargaining
agreement
for
recovery
for
a
discharge
that
violated
the
agreement
and
secondly,
under
the
illinois
law
that
provides
a
remedy
in
such
cases.
the
illinois'
suit
was
removed
to
the
federal
court
where
it
was
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
the
illinois
claim
had
been
preempted
by
the
existence
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
which
is
enforceable
pursuant
to
a
federal
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
announced,
we
reverse
and
hold
that
the
state-law
cause
of
action
is
not
preempted
by
the
federal
remedy
she
had
because
it
is
not
necessary
to
construe
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
in
order
to
determine
the
merits
of
her
state-law
claim.
the
second
case,
meyer
against
colorado,
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
and
our
opinion
is
unanimous
in
that
case.
