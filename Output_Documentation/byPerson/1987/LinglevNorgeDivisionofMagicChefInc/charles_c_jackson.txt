mr.
charles
c.
jackson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
state
court
judge
or
legislature
may
provide
employees
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
discharge
when
those
employees
are
covered
by
the
grievance
arbitration
procedures
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
employee's
claim
is
unquestionably
arbitrable
under
the
terms
of
that
agreement.
resolution
of
this
question,
we
feel,
calls
for
an
analysis
of
two
central
policies
informing
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947.
first,
the
policy...
the
section...
that
if
within
section
301
scope
section
301
completely
preempts
any
state
law
cause
of
action
within
its
scope.
and
second,
the
settled
rule,
the
contractual
grievance
arbitration...
excuse
me,
contractual
arbitration
procedures
are
the
exclusive
and
final
remedy
for
labor
contract
disputes.
at
least
in
her
reply
brief,
petitioner
seems
to
agree
that
the
question
presented
here
has
been
left
open,
was
left
open
in
the
lueck
decision,
the
alice
chalmers
versus
lueck
decision.
in
that
case,
this
court
reserved
judgment
on
whether
an
independent
non-negotiable
state
imposed
duty
could
nevertheless
be
preempted
under
section
301.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
we
think
that
the
retaliatory
discharge
claim
in
illinois
as
it
is
so
labeled
in
illinois
is
simply
another
species
of
wrongful
discharge
tort,
and
i
use
the
phrase
to
illustrate
the
point
that
i
think...
we
think
it
is
destructive
of
the
policies
informing
section
301
to
allow
states
to
single
out
a
variety
of
causes
of
action
that
were
meant
to
be
grist
in
the
mills
of
the
arbitrators
under
the
labor
agreements,
and
that
is
why
i
use
that
term.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
yes,
we
say
that
that
claim,
that
cause
of
action
deals
directly
with
employment
rights.
the
states
historically
have
had
a
great
deal
of
leeway
with
respect
to
workers'
compensation
matters,
but
always
in
the
context
of
the
benefits
workers
would
receive
for
work-related
injuries.
the
recent
phenomenon
of
retaliatory
discharge
claims
addresses
itself
to
employment
rights.
that
is
something
that
is
squarely
governed
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
even
if
the
state's
interest
is
arguably
an
important
one,
it
is
still
preempted
under
section
301,
because
section
301,
unlike
the
balancing
analysis
utilized
in
metropolitan
life
and
other
cases
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
does
not
weigh
the
state's
interest
with
the
rights
asserted
under
federal
policy.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
no,
i
think
the
state
in
that
situation
can
enforce
its
workmen's
compensation.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
because
in
that
situation
this
court
has
recognized,
even
in
the
oliver
decision,
on
which
we
place
a
lot
of
reliance,
that
state
laws
dealing
with
health
and
safety
matters
have
historically
been
those
that
the
court
has
recognized
where
the
state
has
a
lot
of
leeway.
the
state
can
promulgate
laws
prohibiting
the
use
of
child
labor.
if
the
union
and
the
company
were
to
agree
to
a
contract
whereby
child
labor
could
be
used,
that
type
of
law
could
not
be
enforced
for
two
reasons,
not
because
the
contract
terms
themselves
of
themselves
always
prevail
over
state
rights,
but
because
in
that
situation
the
contract
terms
would
be
promoting
no
federal
interest.
section
301
does
not
promote
the
interest
of
exploitation
of
children
nor
does
it
promote
the
interest
of
depriving
employees--
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
--i
think
it
could.
my
response,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
simply
that
that
is
an
area
where
this
court
has
said
and
we
have
agreed
in
this
case
that
with
respect
to
health
and
safety
laws
the
states
do
have
leeway.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
the
states
have
the
most
latitude
with
respect
to
health
and
safety
laws.
this
whole
area,
i
think,
as
the
alice
chalmers
case
pointed
out,
is
one
for
resolution
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
the
right
asserted
by
the
petitioner
is
not
a
health
and
safety
right.
it
is
an
employment
right
and
is
classically
a
right
that
arises
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
i
think
it
is,
and
the
reason
why
i
am
saying
that
the
states
have
more
latitude
with
respect
to
workers'
compensation,
i
don't
want
to
say
that
they
have
complete
latitude.
as
this
court
held
in
the
alessi
versus
raybestos-manhattan
case,
one,
you
have
erisa
problems
with
respect
to
states
promulgating
benefit
rules,
but
beyond
that,
in
the
alessi
case
this
court
also
noted
that
because
the
terms
in
that
particular
situation
were
embodied
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
workers'
compensation
related
benefits,
they
were
also
preempted
by
the
teamsters
versus
oliver
rule.
so
what
we
are
saying
is,
there
is
much
more
latitude
for
the
states
in
that
situation
but
states
don't
necessarily
have
a
carte
blanche
in
that
situation,
as
illustrated
by
the
alessi
case.
petitioner's
position
distills
two
related
propositions,
one,
that
any
right
created
by
a
state
court
judge
or
legislature
that
can
be
articulated
without
reference
to
the
labor
contract
is
necessarily
independent
within
the
meaning
of
alice
chalmers,
and
two,
a
basic
assumption
that
all
such
positive
law
rights
necessarily
coexist
side
by
side
with
the
labor
agreement
and
avoid
preemption
under
section
301.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
that
is
of
the
type
this
court
was
referring
to,
i
think,
in
the
metropolitan
life
case.
that
is
of
the
type
that
the
states
historically
have
had
latitude.
under
section
301
we
are
not
saying
that
employers
and
unions
have
the
authority
to
agree
to
wages
below
that
type
of
minimum
standard.
that
is
just
a
basic
benefit.
in
metropolitan
life
it
was
a
health
insurance,
a
mental
health
insurance
benefit
the
state
of
massachusetts
required
for
insertion
in
its
contract.
they
have
latitude
in
that
particular
area,
but
here
with
respect
to--
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
--we
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
the
employer
and
the
union
don't
have
latitude
to
contract
out
of
workers'
compensation.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
i
think
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
viewpoint.
in
illinois,
at
least,
and
it
may
be
the
case,
as
your
honor
points
out,
in
other
states,
but
at
least
in
illinois
it
is
not
part
of
the
worker's
compensation
scheme,
and
in
fact
it
is
a
tort.
it
is
not...
the
employee
does
not
have
a
statutory
cause
of
action
to
go
to
the
workers'
compensation
committee
and
say,
my
employer
fired
me
for
these
prohibited
reasons.
it's
a
tort
recognized
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
even
if
it
weren't,
even
if
it
were
included
in
the
statutory
scheme,
our
position
is
that
it
is
an
employment
right.
it
crosses
the
line
into
the
concern...
into
the
scope
of
301
and
the
contractual
agreements
procedures
and
it
preempted,
and
i
don't
think,
justice
scalia,
that
jonna
lingle
was
deprived
of
anything
in
this
case
by
that
rule.
she
is
not
getting
fewer
rights
than
other
employees
are
in
the
state
of
illinois.
in
fact,
she
has
got
a
50
some
page
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
provides
for
a
plethora
of
rights.
she
has
contractual
just
cause
protection
from
discharge,
which
doesn't
only
go
to
impermissible
motives
by
an
employer
in
letting...
or
in
firing
mrs.
lingle.
it
goes
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
employer
violated
some
kind
of
procedural
due
process,
and
some
arbitrator
could
say--
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
--no,
i
think,
justice
white,
that--
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
--i
think
that
is
just
simply
in
a
different
category,
and
it
is
part
of
the
case--
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
--we
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
and
we
also--
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
--no,
i
think
the
minimum
wage
law
is
different
for
two
reasons.
one,
agreeing
to
wages
that
are
below
statutory
minimums
is
not
a
policy.
protecting
that
type
of
agreement
is
not
a
policy
of
section
301.
second,
equally
important,
the
federal
policy
under
the
barrentine
decision,
the
federal
policy
says
that
parties
to
labor
contracts
cannot
contract
for
minimum
wages
below
the
federal
level.
that
is
an
indication
at
least
in
the
minimum
wage
context
that
the
states...
that
is
an
affirmance
that
the
states
have
that
kind
of
latitude.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
i
think
that's
right.
another
one
would
be--
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
--i
think
in
a
sense--
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
--no,
i
disagree
with
that.
in
a
sense
you
can
state
the
claim
because
it
is
a
creation
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
you
don't
need
the
contract
to
know
that.
but
if
you
are
the
trier
of
fact,
no
matter
who
you
are,
an
arbitrator,
a
state
court
judge,
your
mission
is
to
determine
whether
there
is
impermissible
motive.
in
that
type
of
situation
the
employer
invariably
is
going
to
raise
its
defense
of
just
cause
under
the
contract.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
and
to
the
extent
there
is
contractual
just
cause,
that
militates
against
a
finding
that
there
was
impermissible
motive.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
just
whether
it
is
a
false
claim
or
not.
there
may
be
all
kinds
of
concepts
in
industrial
relations
that
would...
the
arbitrator
would
consider
but
a
state
court
would
not
consider,
such
as
consistent
administration
of
the
contract,
all
kinds
of
things
that
might
be
probative
of
the
employer's
intent
in
letting
the
particular
individual
go.
the
problem
is,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
misco
decision
just
this
term,
the
parties
here
have
bargained
for
the
facts
to
be
found
by
an
arbitrator.
here
the...
here
i
am
constrained
to
say
that
mrs.
lingle's
claim
is
exactly
what
grievance
arbitration
is
all
about.
this
is
why
parties
have
collective
bargaining
agreements.
this
is
why
there
is
just
cause.
the
system
was
responsive
in
this
situation.
she
was
reinstated
with
full
back
pay,
and
i
am
reminded
of
the
point
that
was
made
earlier
about
possibly
seeking
punitive
damages
on
remand.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
although
technically
under
illinois
law
you
can
seek
punitive
damages,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
not
seek
punitive
damages.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
quarrel
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
very
simple
one.
the
contract
makes
a
distinction
for
back
pay
purposes
between
incentive
pay
and
down
time
rates.
the
arbitrator
found
that
she
was
fully
compensated
at
down
time
rates
as
the
contract
required.
the
petitioner's
complaint
in
this
case
is
that
she
ought
to
be
given
the
incentive
pay
rates,
contrary
to
the
construction
of
the
agreement.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
well,
if
she
won.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
well,
she
could
seek
that
and
a
state
court
judge
would
have
the
power
to
award
that.
so
i
think
that...
i
think
that
the
claim
here
is
inextricably
intertwined
with
the
terms
of
the
labor
agreement.
but
even
if
it's
not,
even
if
we
can
cast
aside,
which
i
don't
think
the
court
should
do,
but
even
if
the
court
were
to
say,
yes,
we
can
look
at
this
claim
and
we
can
view
it
in
isolation
without
respect,
without
regard
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
i
still
think
the
claim
is...
a
preempted
claim
under
the
rule
of
teamsters
versus
oliver
and
cases
like
the
alessi
case
and
the
california
versus
taylor
case.
each
of
those
cases,
as
we
read
them,
held
that
where
independent
state
rights
existed,
and
they
flew
in
the
teeth
of
a
labor
contract,
they
were
preempted.
we
don't
think
the
rule
should
be
any
different
here
where
this
particular
petitioner
is
protected
by
contractual
grievance
arbitration
procedures,
and
also
we
feel
this
is
the
teaching
of
the
republic
steel
case
and
the
u.s.
bulk
carriers
versus
arguelles
case,
where
this
court
said,
at
least
in
arguelles,
that
the
contractual
exclusivity
principle
of
resolution
of
claims
extends
to
even
those
claims
that
are
arguably
extracontractual
in
nature.
and
i
think
that
point
holds
up.
justice
harlan
was
the
author
of
the
republic
steel
case.
he
was
also
the
author
of
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
arguelles
decision,
and
several
other
members
of
the
court
joined
in
that,
that
the
exclusivity
principle
did
extend
beyond
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
now,
were
these
principles
applied
we'd
feel
this
claim
was
preempted.
petitioner
has
several
other
arguments,
and
we
admit
that
some
of
these
arguments
are
close
arguments.
nevertheless,
we
think
she
is
wrong,
and
we
think
that
on
reflection
the
metropolitan
life
decision
does
not
help
her
position.
her
proposition
is
that
any
time
as
we
understand
it,
and
i
didn't
hear
anything
different
today,
any
time
a
state
promulgates
a
minimum
labor
standard
that
can
be
articulated
without
reference
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
that
standard
necessarily--
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
--right.
that
is
part
of
the
trouble
in
this
case,
your
honor.
throughout
the
petitioner's
brief,
as
we
see
it,
and
of
their
amicus
there
is
no
real
definition
given--
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
--what
i
mean
are
those
types
of
laws
that
this
court
has
picked
over
on
a
case-by-case
basis
such
as
those
promoting
public
health
and
safety,
child
labor
again--
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
--in
the
metropolitan
life
case,
for
example,
the
court
stated
that
laws
protecting
public
health
and
safety
would
be
preserved,
child
labor,
minimum
wages,
those
types
of
laws,
occupational
safety
and
health
perhaps,
and
this,
we
would
say,
is
consistent
with
our
reading
of
oliver,
because
even
oliver,
which
was
a
broad
statement
of
section
301
preemption,
we
would
maintain,
not
national
labor
relations
act
preemption,
even
oliver
said
that
perhaps
those
types
of
laws,
health
and
safety
laws,
would
be
exempt
from
section
301
preemption
or
federal
labor
preemption.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
metropolitan
life
said
so,
but
i
think
this
raises
another
point.
it
is
not
nearly
the
description
of
the
federal
law
that
is
at
stake.
we
described
those.
or,
excuse
me,
the
state
law
that
is
at
stake.
it
is
also
the
purpose
of
the
federal
law.
metropolitan
life
permitted
the
state
law
to
be...
or
the
state
action
to
be
maintained
because
a
law
requiring
mental
health
benefits
in
an
insurance
policy
was
not
deemed
to
be
inconsistent
with
a
duty
to
bargain,
a
duty
of
collective
bargaining
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
agree
with
that.
i
mean,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
duty
to
bargain
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
this
case,
under
that
balancing
analysis,
that
type
of
cause
of
action
was
permitted
to
go
ahead.
in
this
case
the
discharge
claim
of
jonna
lingle
is
right
at
the
heart
of
section
301
and
the
federal
policies
that
directed
these
parties,
the
iam
and
the
company,
to
agree
to
contractual
grievance
procedures.
so
the
second
half
of
the
equation
is,
one,
the
type
of
state
law,
and
two,
whether
the
state
law
conflicts
with
the
federal
purpose.
and
as
i
stated
a
little
while
ago,
part
of
the
difficulty
is
the
definition
of
minimum
standards
and
petitioner's
lack
of
definition
of
minimum
standards.
under
their
analysis
as
we
read
it
even
a
state
could
promulgate
a
general
just
cause
for
discharge
statute
just
as
the
state
of
montana,
for
example,
has
already
enacted
and
under
that
montana
law,
with
exceptions
for
collective
bargaining,
all
employees
of
the
state
of
montana
have
a
right
not
to
be
fired
except
for
just
cause,
and
presumably
there
is
going
to
be
a
common
law
developed
as
to
what
is
just
cause
in
montana.
were
the
exclusion
in
that
situation
for
collective
bargaining
not
there,
it
would
be
no
different
from
this
case.
states
could
enact
general
just
cause
for
discharge
statutes
which
set
their
independent
standards.
you
would
not
need
to
look
at
a
labor
agreement.
and
the
claim
could
proceed
under
petitioner's
theory.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
that
is
one
of
the
ironies
in
this
case,
because
the
reason
why
those
exclusions
are
there,
and
in
the
cases
we
cite
in
our
brief
where
they
don't
recognize
the
state
cause
of
action
that
the
petitioner
asserts,
the
irony
is,
is
because
those
states
feel
that
such
a
claim
would
be
preempted,
so
it
is
sort
of
a
circular
thing.
the
reason
why
it
is
not
there
is
that
the
state
feels
it
is
preempted.
if
this
court
were
to
rule
in
this
case
that
states
have
that
authority
to
frame
such
claims,
it
would
open
it
up
for
states
to
be
able
to
enact
precisely
that
type
of--
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
--i
think
generally
not.
i
think
that
is
an
historical
state
interest.
i
don't
think
libel
is
something
that
the
section
301
federal
labor
interest
has
sought
to
protect
historically.
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
i
think
you
are
right,
chief
justice.
it
doesn't
strike
me
as
something
that
states
historically
have
been
precluded
from
reaching
under
federal
labor
analysis.
that
is
why
again
we
hold
it
in
a
two-part
analysis.
one,
what
is
the
type
of
law,
and
two
what
is
the
policy
that
is
sought
to
be
served,
and
is
that
a
federal
policy
under
301?
with
respect
to
this
gardner-denver
point
of
the
petitioners,
gardner-denver
and
the
buell
case
decided
last
year
are
said
to
provide
a
basis
for
recognizing
this
independent
wrongful
discharge
tort.
we
don't
agree
with
that,
and
what
that
argument
does
is,
it
is
essentially
a
shorthand
way
of
saying
there
is
no
such
thing
as
preemption,
because
the
distinction
under
gardner-denver
between
what
is
a
federal
right
and
a
state
right
makes
a
world
of
difference,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out.
there
was
that
arbitration
case
last
year
that
came
out
of
california
that
this
court
decided,
perry
versus
thomas.
so
the
question
is
whether
the
states
have
the
opportunity
to
act.
gardner-denver
doesn't
provide
any
indication
at
all.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
states
have
authority
to
act.
in
fact,
under
gardner-denver
in
titlte
vii
congress
has
said
explicitly
that
unions
and
employers
are
bound
by
the
anti-discrimination
provisions
of
title
vii
and
explicitly
under
that
statute
the
states
are
authorized
to
set
up
title
<vii>
[=
vii]
deferral
agencies
and
regulate
anti-discrimination
concerns.
the
same
is
true
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
barrentine
case.
so,
again,
i
don't
think
those
decisions
provide
any
support
for
the
argument
that
petitioner's
claim
isn't
preempted.
congress
can
say
in
a
uniform
manner
what
exceptions
to
collective
bargaining
are
acceptable.
it
is
not
for
the
states
to
do
that.
finally,
it
is
our
position
that
the
result
sought
by
the
petitioners
is
a
threat
to
arbitration,
and
i
say
that
because
it
has
been
settled
for
quite
some
time,
but
through
section
301
the
labor
law
envisions
a
system
of
industrial
self-government.
this
contractual
grievance
procedure
here
that
gave
jonna
lingle
full
relief,
put
her
back
to
work,
gave
her
back
pay,
this
type
of
agreement
is
exactly
what
takes
place
between
countless
other
employers
and
unions
every
day.
we
believe
that
permitting
the
illinois
wrongful
discharge
tort
to
vindicate
employment
rights
that
have
been
vindicated
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
be
a
threat
to
arbitration.
petitioner's
response
basically
is,
well,
employers
always
say
this.
employers
always
say
that
lots
of
horrible
things
are
going
to
happen
if
you
give
people
rights
to
bring
lawsuits
against
companies.
but
we
maintain
that
it
is
precisely
because
the
courts
have
not
embraced
petitioner's
theory
of
non-preemption
that
arbitration
has
been
preserved.
alice
chalmers
in
a
very
careful
case-by-case
way
is
a
manifestation
of
a
desire
to
prevent
proliferation
of
state
law
causes
of
action
that
could
undermine
arbitration.
in
other
words,
the
floodgates,
if
that
is
the
right
term,
haven't
opened
because--
mr.
charles
c.
jackson
--i
think
that's
precisely
correct,
and
the
problem
with
that
is
that
in
terms
of
national
labor
policy,
it
is
going
to
depend
upon
the
strength
of
the
parties
in
any
given
bargaining
situation.
but
this
is
different
from
title
vii,
which
has
been
around
since
1965,
and
unions
and
employers
have
gotten
used
to
that.
it's
different
from
other
federal
laws
which
have
imposed
statutory
obligations
on
employers
they
have
long
accepted.
this
would
be
authorization
for
states
to
articulate
and
define
causes
of
action
that
would
give
remedies
to
employees
irrespective
of
what
is
provided
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
i
think
it
would
create
an
unacceptable
incentive
to
undermine
arbitration
and...
which
is
an
institution
of
enormous
importance
in
american
labor
law
that
i
don't
have
to
emphasize,
i
don't
think,
any
longer
to
the
court.
in
sum,
we
feel
that
the
claim
is
inextricably
intertwined
with
analysis
of
the
contract.
if
it
is
not
inextricably
intertwined,
it
is
nonetheless,
we
feel,
preempted
under
the
rule
of
teamsters
versus
oliver.
and
third,
we
feel
that
the
exceptions
that...
the
reasons
that
petitioner
gives
for
avoiding
preemption
don't
hold
up
on
the
narrow
facts
of
this
case.
metropolitan
life
does
not
control.
the
nlra
balancing
case
does
not
control
because
the
objectives
here
are
different
from
those
in
metropolitan
life,
and
the
type
of
right
asserted
is
much
different
from
the
one
in
metropolitan
life.
and
finally,
we
don't
think
that
the
alexander,
gardner-denver
line
has
any
teaching
on
the
question
now
before
the
court.
for
the
foregoing
reasons
respondent
respectfully
submits
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
