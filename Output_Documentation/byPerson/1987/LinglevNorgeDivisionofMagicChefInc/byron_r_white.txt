justice
white
but
there
certainly
is
a
right
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
this
case.
justice
white
which
was
vindicated.
justice
white
namely,
there
wasn't
good
cause
for
discharge.
justice
white
and
you
think
both
causes
of
action
can
just
go
forward?
justice
white
and
what
was
the
relief
that
the
arbitrator
gave?
justice
white
will
the
recovery...
if
you
win,
will
the
recovery...
would
the
recovery
in
a
state
court
action
include
back
pay
again,
or
what?
justice
white
if
the
state
court--
justice
white
--if
the
state
court
suit
goes
first
you
get
a
complete
recovery
so
you
can't
arbitrate.
justice
white
well,
it
would
just
be
barred,
i
suppose.
justice
white
so
the...
but
you
don't
think
in
the
state
court
action
it
will
ever
be
necessary
to
construe
the
contract
or
find
what--
justice
white
--what
if
the
arbitrator
had
found
there
was
just
cause
for
discharge,
that
this
workmen's
compensation
claim
was
false?
suppose
that
had
been
decided
by
the
arbitrator.
justice
white
well,
what
do
you
think?
do
you
think
you
can
relitigate
that
issue
in
the
state
court?
justice
white
yes
or
no?
yes,
you
can--
justice
white
--so
in
effect
you
are
saying
that
the...
it
is
just,
what,
contrary
to
federal
law
or
to
state
law
to
permit
a
discharge
on
a
false
claim?
justice
white
the
state
law
claim,
however,
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
good
defense
to
a
state
action
if
the
claim
were
false.
justice
white
well,
what
would
you
think?
would
it
or
not?
justice
white
assume
it
was
a
good
defense,
and
the
arbitrator
has
found
that
it
was
a
false
claim.
you
still
say
you
can
relitigate
that
in
state
court.
justice
white
but
that
sort
of
argument
would
mean
that
the
state
couldn't
apply
its
minimum
wage
law.
justice
white
well,
look
at
all
these
other
rights
you
get.
justice
white
so
you
can't
contract
out
of
the
minimum
wage
law.
justice
white
well,
here
is
a
state--
justice
white
--here
is
a
state
law
that
says,
if
you
commit
this
tort
you
are
going
to
get
actual
damages,
punitive
damages,
whatever
it
is,
and
now
the
union
and
the
employer
say,
well,
if
you
commit
this...
if
you
commit
this
act
which
is
a
tort
under
state
law,
all
you
are
going
to
get
is
back
pay.
you
are
just
going
to
get
much
less
than
what
the
state
law
says
you
are
entitled
to.
isn't
that
just
like
minimum
wage
laws?
justice
white
let
me
ask
you,
preemption
of
state
causes
of
action
is...
occurs
because
of
some
evil
that
non-preemption
would
cause.
what
is
that
evil?
one
of
them
anyway
is
to
avoid
having
different
constructions
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
i
suppose.
justice
white
how
can
enforcing
the
state
law
in
this
case
have
a
different
construction
and
meaning
to
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
because
you
seem
to
concede
that
you
can
state
your
state
cause
of
action
without
any
relation
to
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
justice
white
it
is
just
a
fact
question.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
yes,
but
it
isn't
a
construction
as
to
what
is
just
cause.
it
is
just
a
matter
of
fact.
was
this
a
false
claim
or
not?
justice
white
which
she
would
get
if
the
action
went
forward
in
state
court.
justice
white
let's
assume
that
she
won.
she
would
get
that.
justice
white
are
state
causes
of
action
for
libel
preempted?
when
an
employee
sues
an
employer,
or
an
employer
sues
an
employee?
justice
white
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
agreement,
and
i
suppose
your
client
may
resist
agreeing
to
arbitration
in
the
future
if
all
these
causes
of
action
are
going
to
go
on
to
state
court.
