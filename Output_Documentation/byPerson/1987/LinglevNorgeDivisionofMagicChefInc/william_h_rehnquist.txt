chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
87-259,
jonna
r.
lingle
versus
norge
division
of
magic
chef.
mr.
levy,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
even
if
there
were
some
sort
of
of
federal
principle
that
required
the
state
court
to
give
collateral
estoppel
effect
to
the
finding
that
the
claim
has
been
false,
that
would
not
affect
your
basic
preemption
argument,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
the
suit
for
discriminatory
discharge
for
invoking
the
workmen's
comp
could
still
proceed
even
though
the
state
court
might
have
to
treat
a
particular
finding
on
that
point
as
binding
for
factual
purposes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
levy.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
jackson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
union
and
the
employer
set
out
to
say,
you
know,
we
are
really
going
to
have
a
comprehensive
agreement
here,
we
are
going
to
provide
for
benefits
in
case
you
are
injured
on
the
job.
the
employer
will
pay
them
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
does
that
mean
that
a
state
can't
even
enforce
its
workmen's
compensation
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
is
one
different
from
the
other
if
each
situation
is
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
in
a
workmen's
compensation
case
you
can
certainly
say
it
proposed
smooth,
speedy
adjustment
of
grievances
under
the
contract,
and
the
contract
gives
the
person
the
same
rights
they
have
against
the
employer
as
the
illinois
law
would.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
is
only
demonstrably
health
and
safety
laws,
not
other
important
concerns
of
state
public
policy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
a
minimum
labor
standard,
mr.
jackson?
this
i
would
say
was
a
retaliatory
discharge
claim.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you
used
the
term.
you
used
the
term
minimum
labor
standards.
i
am
asking
you
what
it
means.
chief
justice
rehnquist
picked
over
on
a
case-by-case
basis
in
what
sort
of
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly
metropolitan
life
said
so
in
really
no
uncertain
terms.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
isn't
that
a
rather
unlikely
possibility?
my
impression
has
been
that
the
just
cause
statutes
are
generally
designed
to
give
that
right
to
people
who
don't
have
it
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
is
hardly
either
health
or
safety
under
your
rather
narrow
definition
of
those
terms.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jackson.
mr.
levy,
you
have
ten
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
three
cases,
lingle
versus
norge
division
of
magic
chef,
meyer
against
grant,
and
mccoy
versus
court
of
appeals
of
wisconsin
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
