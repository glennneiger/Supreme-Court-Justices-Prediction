justice
kennedy
incidentally,
counsel,
you
began
by
saying
the
question
was
whether
or
not
a
wrongful
discharge
cause
of
action
can
be
prosecuted
or
is
preempted,
but
this
is
a
retaliatory
discharge.
there
is
a
difference,
isn't
there?
justice
kennedy
and
it
is
improper
to
single
out
retaliatory
acts
for
insisting
on
workmen's
compensation
rights?
justice
kennedy
is
workmen's
compensation
a
health
and
safety
law?
