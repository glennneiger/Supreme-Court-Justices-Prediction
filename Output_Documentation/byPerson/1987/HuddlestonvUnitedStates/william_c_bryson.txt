mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
our
position
in
this
case
is
very
simple.
it
is
that
rule
404(b)
does
one
thing
and
one
thing
only.
it
prohibits
the
use
of
similar
act,
what
we
are
calling
similar
act
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
showing
propensity.
that
is
to
say,
it
prevents
the
government
in
a
criminal
case
from
using
similar
act
evidence
to
show
that
a
person
is
a
bad
man,
and
then
asking
the
jury
to
draw
the
inference
from
the
fact
that
he
is
a
bad
man
that
he
did
the
bad
acts
that
are
charged
in
the
indictment.
as
we
read
the
rule,
once
the
judge
has
performed
that
act
of
screening,
once
the
judge
has
said,
this
may
not
be
used
for
propensity,
then
that
evidence
is
treated
just
the
same
as
any
other
evidence
that
comes
before
the
court
for
admission
to
the
jury
under
a
relevance
standard.
the
question
then
is
under
401
is
the
evidence
relevant,
and
the
question
is
under
403
is
the
evidence
too
prejudicial
to
be
admitted
given
its
probative
weight?
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
it
does
come
in,
your
honor.
if
the
evidence--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--if
it
is
extremely
slender
and
it
is
very,
very--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--absolutely.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
certainly,
your
honor.
i
certainly
think
so.
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
evidence
as
a
whole
and
particularly
focusing
on
the
extent
to
which
the
evidence
bears
on
the
questions
presented
in
the
case,
and
if,
for
example,
the
evidence
is
very
weakly
proven,
and
for
example
if
the
evidence
bears
only
slightly
on
the
questions
that
are
before
the
jury,
and
if
the
evidence
is
extremely
prejudicial,
the
court
could
conclude
that
that
is
a
factor,
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
enough
to
justify
a
jury
in
concluding
that
they
are
stolen,
and
we
make
the
point
in
the
brief.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
sure.
the
way
we
view
the
question
of
relevance
in
this
case
on
the
television
sets
is
that,
number
one,
these
were
sets
that
were
sold
in
a
barroom,
basically.
the
initial
contact
was
made
by
somebody
walking
into
a
barroom
and
saying,
are
you
interested
in
television
sets.
number
two,
this
was
a
case
of
someone
who
had
announced
that
he
had
a
truckload
of
television
sets.
now,
this
wasn't
a
case
of
somebody
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
television
set
that
wouldn't
work
at
home
and
trying
to
bring
the
television
set
into
a
barroom
and
see
if
he
could
get
rid
of
it.
the
televisions
were
being
sold
for
an
extremely
low
price,
$28
for
a
12-inch
black
and
white
television,
and
in
fact
the
evidence
from
the
defense,
which
was
the
evidence
of
this
lawyer
who
participated
in
the
sale
of
other
televisions
was
that
the
defendants
paid
a
total
of,
by
his
claim,
paid
a
total
of
about
$10,000
to
$12,000
for
the
whole
truckload
of
televisions,
which
works
out
to
be
about
$13
to
$16
for
each
set,
so
the
combination
of
the
price,
the
circumstances
of
the
sale,
and
the
volume
are,
we
think,
sufficient
evidence
just
standing
by
themselves
to
justify
the
inference
on
the
part
of
the
jury
that
these
were
stolen
television
sets,
and
then
if
you
add
to
that
the
fact
that
in
other
instances
mr.
huddleston
was
dealing
with
the
same
people
in
part
of
the
same
operation
with
goods
that
he
admitted
to
the
fbi
agent
were
hot,
then
that
makes
a
very
convincing
case
to
go
to
the
jury,
we
think,
on
the
question
of
whether
they
were
in
fact
stolen.
now,
our
backup
position,
of
course,
is
that
it
isn't
necessary
to
establish
that
these
televisions
were
stolen
in
order
for
that
evidence
to
be
admissible,
and
this
was
an
argument
that
was
made
in
fact
in
the
closing
argument
in
the
rebuttal
summation.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
don't
think
it
would
have
to
make
that
finding,
your
honor,
because
suppose
the
jury
concluded,
we
just
don't
think
they
were
stolen.
the
evidence
doesn't
fall
out
because
of
that,
because
they
could
still
find,
well,
but
what
it
does
show,
what
this
other
evidence
does
show
is
that
mr.
huddleston
was
in
an
operation
that
was
much
larger.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
we
think
that
would
be
open
to
argue
that
if
the
court
concluded
that
the
other
theory
of
relevance,
our
backup
theory
of
relevance
was
inapplicable,
but...
in
other
words,
the
court
could--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
there
are
two
different
issues,
i
think,
if
i
can
sort
them
out,
because
i
think
they
get
resolved
in
a
slightly
different
way.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i'm
sorry.
you
were
saying
that
we
had
no
business
aruing
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
and
perhaps
this
is
the
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
may,
your
honor,
under
this
circumstance,
and
that
is
why
this
case
presents
both
parts
of
the
analysis
as
we
see
it.
it
may...
the
judge
may
have
to
make
a
finding,
a
preliminary
finding
under
rule
104(b)
if
the
question
is
a
question
of
conditional
relevance.
that
is
to
say,
suppose
the
only
possible
theory
on
which
this
evidence
could
be
admitted
would
be
if
the
jury
could
find
that
it
was
stolen.
under
those
circumstances,
the
defendant
could
say,
well,
i
don't
want
this
evidence
to
come
in
unless
you,
judge,
find
that
a
jury
could
find
that
the
evidence
was
stolen.
that's,
your
honor,
just--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
under
104(b),
your
honor--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--of
course
the
judge
can
admit
evidence
subject
to
its
being
connected
up,
but
this
is
a
basic...
there
is
nothing
special
about
rule
104(b).
it
is
simply
articulating
a
basic
principle
of
relevance,
and
that
is
that
the
evidence
has
to
be
ultimately
tied
up.
in
other
words,
suppose
you
have
a
case
in
which
a
witness
testifies
that
someone
was
seen
fleeing
from
a
bank.
you
have
to
have
some
evidence,
some
basis
for
concluding
that
that
someone
was
the
defendant
before
the
evidence
is
relevant.
so
it
is
just
a
basic--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--of
course.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
precisely.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
your
honor,
not...
and
this
is
where
we
differ
from
petitioner.
we
are
not
asking
the
judge
to
make
a
preponderance
finding
or
any
other
standing.
we
are
asking
that
the
judge
do
what
the
judge
does
in
the
case
of
every
piece
of
evidence
that
is
challenged
on
relevance
grounds,
which
is
to
ask,
could
the
jury
make
this
finding?
if
i
said
the
judge
to
make
a
finding
of
fact,
i
misspoke.
what
i
mean
is,
the
judge
looks
at
this
question
and
says,
could
the
jury,
conclude
in
this
case
that
these
televisions
were
stolen?
now,
if
the
evidence
is
relevant
without
regard
to
whether
the
televisions
were
stolen,
then
that
course
of
logic
that
requires
the
judge
to
say,
could
a
jury
conclude
that
they
were
stolen
isn't
necessary
to
do.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--oh,
yes,
on
that
theory,
and
we
say
so
in
the
last
footnote
in
our
brief.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
because
the
testimony...
the
way
the
testimony
came
in
in
this
case,
we
had
first
the
witness
who
testified
about
the
actual
sales
of
the
tapes,
and
she
testified
that
mr.
huddleston
said
he
had
not
only
these
tapes
but
also
had
some
movies
that
he
was
trying
to
sell
in
the
meantime.
the
second
witness
who
testified
was
the
witness
with
respect
to
the
black
and
white
tvs,
and
he
testified
that
not
only
did
mr.
huddleston
try
to
sell
the
black
and
white
tvs
but
he
also
tried
to
sell
the
blank
tapes
that...
obviously,
the
tapes
that
were
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
then
the
third
witness,
who
is
the
one
that
testified
about
mr.
huddleston's
dealings
a
week
after
the
transactions
in
this
case
testified
that
mr.
huddleston
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
not
only
the
amana
refrigerators
but
also
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
movies
and
also
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
some
color
tvs.
what
the
jury
could
conclude
from
all
of
this
quite
without
regard
to
whether
any
of
this
stuff
other
than
the
stuff
that
was
at
issue
in
the
case
was
stolen,
was
that
mr.
huddleston's
role
in
this
entire
operation
was
a
much
more
extensive
role
than
he
claimed
at
trial.
his
claim
at
trial
was
basically...
his
defense
was,
how
could
i
know
that
this
material
was
stolen,
these
tapes
were
stolen,
because
my
role
was
so
limited,
all
i
was
doing
was,
i
was
making
the
contact.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
that
is
not--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--you
bet,
and
that
is
not
just
impeachment
because
his
whole
defense
was
lack
of
knowledge
on
the
basis
of
having
so
little
contact
with
this
material
that
he
had
no--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
right,
but
our
point
is
that
if
has
contact
with
the
same
people,
the
same
operation
over
an
extended
period
of
time,
he
is
much
more
integrally
involved
in
that
operation,
and
therefore
much--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--because
he
knows...
he
is
much
more
integrally
involved
with
the
operation
and
therefore
he
is
much
more--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--because
he
is
running
operation
or
playing
a
very
major
role
in
the
operation,
the
jury
could
infer
that
his
defense,
which
is
that
he
had
so
little
contact
he
had
no
reason
to
inquire,
he
was
just
doing
a
favor
for
a
friend
just
doesn't
wash.
in
other
words,
somebody
who
is
in
a
position
of
running
the
operation
is
going
to
be
likely
to
know
much
more
about
the
quality
of
the
goods
than
somebody
who
is
just
doing
a
favor
by
making
a
contact.
that's
the
second
theory
of
relevance,
which
doesn't
depend
on
whether
those
tvs
were
stolen.
now,
we
think
that
the
inference
of
knowledge
from
the
fact
that
they
were
stolen,
from
the
conclusion
that
they
were
stolen
is
a
powerful
inference,
and
we
don't
need
to
rely
on
the
second
theory,
but
i
think
the
second
theory
would
certainly
justify
the
judge
in
letting
the
evidence
in,
and
in
fact
the
prosecutor
argued
to
the
jury
that
one
reason
you
can
conclude
that
this
evidence
is
pertinent
is
because
it
tends
to
rebut
his
claim
that
he
was
so
busy
with
his
contracting
business
that
he
really
just
relegated
to
a
small
part
of
his
attention
the
business
of
selling
these
tapes,
and
the
prosecutor
explained,
he
was
doing
this,
he
was
spending
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
on
this
entire
operation.
this
was
not
something
that
was
just
a
by
the
way
accommodation
by
making
a
couple
of
phone
calls
for
somebody,
and
from
that
we
can
infer
an
opportunity
to
have
much
more
information
about
the
stolen
nature
of
the
tapes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
you
mean
in
other
words--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
the
second
theory,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
would
think
it
would
be
relevant,
your
honor,
and
it
is
so
minimally
prejudicial
that
i
think
the
balance
could
probably
be
drawn
in
favor
of
admitting
the
evidence.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
the
counterfeit.
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
petitioner
would
want
to
do
them
one
by
one,
but
we
would
not,
and
i
think
that
you're
correct,
that
when
you
put
them
all
together
it
makes
a
compelling
showing
with
regard
to
each,
and
there
is
no
reason
that
a
judge
in
looking
at
the
question
of
whether
this
is
something
that
a
jury
could
conclude
established
the
question
which
was
the
basis
for
the
conditional
relevance
finding.
the
judge
can
look
at
all
that
evidence,
just
as
the
judge
could
look
at
other
evidence
with
respect
to
each
incident.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
suppose
we
were--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
suppose
in
my
counterfeit
example
we
were
unable
for
some
reason
to
prove
that
several
of
the
bills
were
counterfeit,
which
would
be
analogous
to
this
case.
nonetheless,
suppose
further
that
the
man
went
into
these
stores
and
paid...
he
went
into
five
straight
stores
and
paid
with
a
$50
bill
for
a
15
cent
package
of
gum.
that
is
pretty
probative
of
the
fact
that
something
fishy
is
going
on,
because
he
is
trying
to
get
rid
of
fifties,
and
who
gets
rid
of
fifties?
people
that
are
carrying
bad
fifties.
that's
why--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
if
in
fact
it
is
proved
they
are
good
fifties,
then
we
have
a
problem,
but--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
we
don't
know
they're
stolen
but
certainly
the
evidence
is
probative
because
of
the
nature
of
what
it
describes
about
the
process
the
defendant
is
engaged
in.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
first
theory
being
the
theory
that
it
was
admissible
without
regard
to
whether
they
were
stolen,
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
question.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
on
the
second
you
would,
and
the
question
would
be
one
not
of
whether
either
there
was
clear
or
convincing
evidence
or
even
that
the
judge
believes--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
there
is
a
preponderance,
but
rather
whether
a
reasonable
jury
could
draw
this
inference.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
on
the
stolen
property
theory.
and,
your
honor,
there
is
no
difference
in
our
submission,
there
is
nothing
special
about
that
process.
it
is
no
different
from
the
process
that
a
judge
follows
either
implicitly
or
explicitly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
evidence,
your
honor,
was--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
the
evidence
was
offered
on
a--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
the
evidence
was
offered
on
the
basis
that
it
was
relevant
to
knowledge.
it
wasn't
specified
in
any
great
detail
as
to
how.
the
prosecutor
argued
in
closing
argument
without
objection
that
one
reason
that
it
was
relevant
was
because
it
showed
how
much
the
defendant
was
involved
in
this
whole
operation,
which
didn't
require
a
conclusion
that
the
property
was
stolen.
now,
with
respect
to
that
point,
we
have
not
changed
our
position.
the
only
change
in
the
position
to
the
extent
that
there
is
one,
your
honor,
has
been
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
we
sought
rehearing
en
banc
we
argued
that
the
court
should
not
apply
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
but
rather
should
apply
the
test
it
had
previously
embraced,
which
is
the
preponderance
test.
now,
we
were
stuck
with
what
the
court
had
previously
said
as
our
alternative
argument.
the
sixth
circuit
had
previously
adopted
a
preponderance
test.
obviously
it
would
have
been
better
if
we
had
put
in
a
foot-note
and
said
that
we
believed
that
even
the
preponderance
test
is
not
correct,
but
i
think
we
would
have
had
little
hope
of
persuading
the
sixth
circuit
to
abandon
its
previous
position
on
that.
but
the...
even
the
preponderance
test,
i
think,
is
a
test
which
has
created
a
lot
of
confusion
because
several
courts
have
failed
to
distinguish
between
the
question
of
whether
a
judge
makes
a
finding
by
a
preponderance
or
whether
the
judge
says,
a
jury
could
find,
which
is
to
say,
a
jury
could
find
by
a
preponderance.
in
104(b),
just
as
in
any
other
case
of
foundation
evidence,
the
question
is,
can
the
judge
find
or
conclude
that
the
jury
could
find
by
a
preponderance
that
a
particular
fact
is
proven,
and
that
is,
we
say
that
is
a
basic
relevance
inquiry.
that,
we
think,
is
the
correct
view.
you
can
call
it
a
preponderance
view
of
a
sort,
although
i
think
that
is
misleading.
but
it
is
definitely
not
the
judge
making
a
determination
that
there
is
a
preponderance
and
therefore
making,
for
example,
credibility
determinations
that
are
properly
left
for
the
jury.
now,
i
think
in
order
to
focus
on
this
distinction
between
rules
104(a)
and
104(b),
which
is
the
crux
of
petitioner's
argument
now,
it
is
important
to
note
that
104(a)
deals
basically
with
questions
of
competence,
not
questions
of
relevancy.
the
rule
applies,
for
example
to
preliminary
questions
in
determining
whether
hearsay
evidence
should
be
admitted,
preliminary
questions
in
determining
whether
a
witness
is
qualified,
that
sort
of
inquiry.
it
does
not
apply
and
specifically
excepts
that
class
of
cases
which
deals
with
relevance,
which
is
104(b).
this
question
in
this
case
as
we
see
it
is
a
pure
question
of
relevance.
i
think
petitioner
is
correct
that
if
this
were
a
104(a)
question,
a
question
committed
to
a
judge
to
make
a
decision
as
the
judge
sitting
under
a
lego
against
twomey
type
situation,
that
the
preponderance
test
would
apply.
that
is
to
say,
the
judge
would
have
to
decide
on
his
own
whether
the
evidence
had
met
whatever
factual
condition
there
was
by
a
preponderance.
that
does
not
apply
in
the
case
of
rule
104(b)
where
the
rule
specifically
states
that
all
that
is
necessary
is
for
the
judge
to
conclude
that
there
is
enough
evidence
to
justify
the
finding,
that
is
to
say,
to
justify
the
jury
making
a
finding,
and
the
advisory
committee
notes
to
104(b)
specifically
lay
out
that
this
is
a
question
for
juries,
this
is
not
a
question
for
judges.
that
is
the
question
we
have
in
this
case,
which
is
one
of
conditional
relevance,
if
we
go
solely
on
the
stolen
property
theory.
conditional
relevance
may
not
apply
at
all,
if
we
go
on
the
theory
that
the
evidence
is
admissible
without
regard
to
whether
the
tvs
were
stolen,
so
that's
the
way
we
view
the
relationship
between
rule
104(a)
and
104(b).
in
any
event,
the
clear
and
convincing
test
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
this.
it
was
invented,
we
think,
by
the
courts
in
just
sort
of
expression
of
antagonism
towards
evidence
of
this
sort.
it
is
not
reflected
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
language
of
any
of
the
rules.
it
is
simply
made
up.
now,
as
to
the
assertion
that
petitioner
makes
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
is
exactly
what
we
say.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
a
judge
should
not
draw
a
conclusion
like
that
which
would
simply
be
a
way
of
getting
around
rule
104(b),
but
i
would
think
there
would
be
cases--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--exactly.
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
for
a
judge
to
say
as
a
matter
of
course
in
my
courtroom
from
here
on
out
i
am
going
to
read
rule
403
and
you
are
never
going
to
get
anything
in
unless
it
meets
the
preponderance
test,
no
matter
how
minimally
prejudicial
it
is,
or
like
your
red
hat
example,
it
is
not
prejudicial
at
all.
i
mean,
i
have
an
aversion
to
red
hats,
and
you
had
better
prove
it
by
a
preponderance.
that
would
be
crazy,
and
it
would
also
be
wrong,
but
the
test
that
we
suggest
and
what
i
think
the
advisory
committee
and
the
various
committees
that
commented
on
the
rules
at
the
time
they
were
being
devised
wanted
to
focus
the
attention
of
the
court
on
the
question
of,
a,
relevance,
and
b,
prejudicial
versus
probative,
and
that
is
the
question
that
is
just
an
inherent
part
of
the
whole
article
4
relevancy
provision
in
the
rules.
now,
petitioner
claims
that
a
number
of
circuits
have
adopted
his
104(a)
analysis
here.
as
we
read
it,
only
one
circuit
has
adopted
rule
104(a),
and
that
is
the
seventh
circuit,
and
it
has
done
it
in
a
kind
of
backwards
way.
what
it
has
said
is
because
we
adhere
to
the
clear
and
convincing
test,
and
the
seventh
circuit
is
one
of
the
courts
that
adheres
to
that
test,
we
believe
that
it
would
be
odd
to
ask
a
jury
to
make
a
finding
like
that.
therefore
a
judge
must
make
such
a
finding,
and
therefore
because
the
only
rule
that
requires
judges
to
make
findings
is
rule
104(a),
therefore
this
must
be
a
rule
104(a)
question.
well,
if
you
don't
start
with
the
assumption
that
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
test
is
the
right
test,
then
you
don't
end
up
with
rule
104(a).
every
other
court
that
has
addressed
this
question
has
either
ruled
that
the
clear
and
convincing
or
preponderance
test
applies
without
focusing
on
the
rule
at
all,
simply
by
applying
old
common
law
notions
from
their
own
common
law
developments,
or
have
been
courts
that
have
said
this
is
a
question
of
conditional
relevance,
which
is
our
position.
now,
we
think
that
some
courts
have
incorrectly
said
it
is
always
a
conditional
relevance
question.
it
isn't
always
a
conditional
relevance
question,
but
there
may
not
be
any
preliminary
fact
to
be
found,
but
when
it
is,
then
it
is
decided
under
rule
104(b),
just
like
any
other
piece
of
evidence.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
they
invoked
the
clear
and
convincing
test,
which
it
seems
to
me
is
the
error.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
believe
so,
in
the
panel
opinion.
i
believe
that
they
invoked
the
clear
and
convincing
test,
which
was
why
they
withdrew
their
opinion
in
light
of
the
conflict
between
that
case,
that
decision,
and
the
ebens
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
