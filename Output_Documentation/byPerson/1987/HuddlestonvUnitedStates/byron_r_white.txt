justice
white
well,
you
could
certainly...
i
suppose
the
defendant
is
perfectly
entitled
to
put
on
other
evidence
that
he
didn't
commit
these
acts
and
let
the
jury
decide
it.
justice
white
--that
was
the
panel
opinion,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
what
about
the...
on
rehearing?
justice
white
not
what?
justice
white
not
necessary.
justice
white
but
they
did.
justice
white
and
what
did
they
say?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
the
jury,
the
jury
is
going
to
have
to
find
that
they
were
stolen.
justice
white
so
you
don't
think
in
the
court
of
appeals
then
it
should
even
have
been
open
to
argue
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
for
any
reasonable
jury
to
find
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
televisions
were
stolen?
justice
white
well,
yes,
but
you
say
it
is
admissible
without
any
prior
decision
by
a
judge
if
it
is
relevant.
justice
white
now,
if
you
are
right
in
that
regard
you
have
no
business
argument
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
as
to
whether
the
goods
were
stolen
on
appeal,
right?
justice
white
well,
eventually
answer
my
question.
justice
white
well,
go
ahead,
but
sooner
or
later
answer
it.
justice
white
and
then
does
it
make
any
difference
on
appeal
whether
or
not
there
is
sufficient
evidence
for
a
jury
to
find
that
the
televisions
were
stolen?
justice
white
mr.
bryson,
on
your
first
theory
of
relevance,
if
we
accept
that,
do
we
have
to
reach
the
argument
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
for
any
reasonable
jury
to
find
that
these
televisions
were
stolen?
justice
white
how
about
your
second?
justice
white
no,
no,
whether
a
reasonable
jury
could
find.
justice
white
so
we
do
have
to
reach
on--
justice
white
--it
seems
to
me
that
on
your
first
theory,
that
that
wasn't...
that
wasn't
the
basis
on
which
this
evidence
was
offered.
justice
white
--and
we
don't
know
what
a
trial
judge
would
have
thought
about
it.
we
don't
even
know
what
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
thought
about
it.
justice
white
because
you
have
changed
your
position
from
the
court
of
appeals.
