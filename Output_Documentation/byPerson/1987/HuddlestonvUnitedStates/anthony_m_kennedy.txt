justice
kennedy
but
you
are
saying
the
judge
has
to
decide
that.
suppose
there
is
a
dispute
over
whether
or
not
the
prior
bad
act
occurred.
justice
kennedy
suppose
there
is
an
offer
of
proof
that
the
prior
bad
act
did
occur,
and
the
defense
counsel
says,
we
are
going
to
argue
that
it
didn't.
doesn't
that
go
to
the
jury?
the
court
doesn't
hear
that.
justice
kennedy
you
say
it
is
the
same
rule
as
with
a
voluntary
confession.
justice
kennedy
the
court
first
decides
whether
it
is
a
voluntary
confession,
and
then
the
jury
decides
it
again.
justice
kennedy
can
you
get
that
out
of
the
evidence?
justice
kennedy
but
this
isn't...
is
that
just
because
of
the
highly
dangerous
nature
of
this
evidence
in
your
view,
because
104(a)
doesn't
make
that
distinction.
justice
kennedy
suppose
the
judge
finds
that
a
reasonable
trier
of
fact
could
find
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
bad
act
occurred
but
he
doesn't
think
it
did.
then
what?
justice
kennedy
my
question
is
what...
then
does
it
still
go
to
the
trier
of
fact,
to
the
jury?
justice
kennedy
so
that
he
doesn't
have
to
make
a
finding.
all
he
has
to
find
is
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
from
which
a
jury
might
make
the
determination.
justice
kennedy
may
i
ask--
--but
he
doesn't
have
to
make
a
finding.
