justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
bad
act
in
this
case,
the
sale
of
the
television
sets?
is
it
your
view
that
the
bad
act
that
must
be
proven
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is
that,
a,
the
televisions
were
sold
for
a
very
low
price,
b,
they
were
stolen,
and
c,
he
knew
they
were
stolen?
do
they
have
to
prove
all
three
of
those
elements
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
stevens
knew
that
they
were
stolen.
justice
stevens
and
here
all
they
really
proved
was
the
first
three,
isn't
it?
that's
the
only--
justice
stevens
--well,
three
years
after
the
trial
doesn't
help
very
much.
justice
stevens
did
the
government
argue
that
it
had
proved
that
the
tvs
were
stolen
and
that
he
knew
they
were
stolen?
justice
stevens
knowledge
of
what,
knowledge
of
the
tape
sale
or
the
tv
sale?
justice
stevens
mr.
bryson,
before
you
go
into
this
alternative
theory
of
relevance,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
position
on
the
conditional
relevance.
is
it
not
correct
in
your
view
that
whether
the
standard
is
measuring
probative
value
versus
prejudice
or
whether
it
is
some
kind
of
a
tentative
preponderance
finding,
that
the
judge
might
admit
it
at
the
time
it
is
offered
subject
to
hearing
what
else
is
offered
on
that
same
issue,
whether
it
is
for
tying
up,
as
the
chief
justice
says,
or
for
making
an
appropriate
judgment
on
this
balancing
business,
and
that
if
he
determines
later
on,
well,
they
never
did
offer
anything
else,
then
he
would
instruct
the
jury
to
disregard
it.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
stevens
so
it
is
conditional
at
least
to
that
extent--
justice
stevens
--even
if
it
is
just
a
balancing
process.
justice
stevens
so
you
agree...
i
want
to
be
perfectly
clear
about
it...
you
agree
that
on
the
theory
that
they
were
trying
to
prove
the
television
sets
were
stolen,
that
that
104(b)
does
apply.
justice
stevens
all
right.
now
i
am
very
much
interested
in
your
explanation
of
why
it
is
relevant
even
if
they
are
not
stolen.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
you
are
claiming
it
is
impeachment?
it
is
just
impeachment?
i
am
talking
about
just
the
government's
affirmative
case.
justice
stevens
you
put
it
in
before
he
testified,
didn't
you?
justice
stevens
so
little
contact
with
the
tapes.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
if
three
out
of
the
four
products,
there
is
no
evidence
they
are
stolen,
how
does
that
tend
to
prove
that
he
knew
the
fourth
product
was
stolen?
justice
stevens
well,
sears
roebuck
sells
400
items
and
then
because
it
is
a
big
operation
and
they
happen
to
have
one
stolen
item
that
makes
them
know
that
one
stolen
item?
i
don't
understand.
justice
stevens
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
there
were
evidence
that
was
really
very
powerful
that
none
of
the
other
items
were
stolen?
justice
stevens
your
second
theory
of
relevance
would
be
the
same
even
if
he
came
in
later
and
gave
evidence
that
you
would
accept
as
clear
and
convincing--
justice
stevens
--you
would
still
say
it
is
the
same.
justice
stevens
of
course,
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one
is
that
everybody
agrees
on
your
hypothetical
they
were
counterfeit,
but
here
you
don't
have
any
agreement
on
whether
these
other
items
were
all
stolen.
justice
stevens
if
you
have
50
$10
bills
and
49
of
them
are
genuine
and
one
of
them
is
counterfeit
and
he
passed
all
50,
what
does
that
prove?
justice
stevens
but
then
you
prove
they're
good
fifties,
the
whole
thing
seems
kind
of
silly.
justice
stevens
in
fact,
this
is
one
of
the
problems
with
hypothetical
cases.
you
don't
go
around
peddling
good
$50
bills.
that
is
your
point.
but
you
know
they
are
counterfeit
in
your
hypothetical,
and
you
don't
know
they
are
stolen
here.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
theory?
justice
stevens
do
you
agree
that
in
the
first
time
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case,
although
they
weighed
the
factors
different
from
the
way
you
would,
that
they
followed
the
procedure
that
you
say
was
correct?
they
just
did
this
balancing
and
said
the
district
judge
had
found
that
probative
value
outweighed
the
other?
justice
stevens
in
the
first--
justice
stevens
--well,
i
guess
i
misread
it.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
there,
when
you
say
preponderance
of
evidence,
do
you
mean
the
judge
must
find
by
a
preponderance,
or
there
must
be
sufficient
evidence
that
a
jury
could
find?
justice
stevens
so
you
and
your
opponent
disagree
on
the
meaning
of
the
preponderance
standard.
justice
stevens
i
had
thought
that
the
government's
in
agreement
on
that.
i
am
not
sure
you
are
in--
