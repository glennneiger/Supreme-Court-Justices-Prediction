chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
87-6,
guy
rufus
huddleston
versus
united
states.
mr.
ferris,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
is
your
name
pronounced
"fearis"
or
"fairis"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
"fairis".
okay.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
ferris.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
there
is
certainly
a
great
deal
of
support
for
it
in
the
traditional
common
law
of
evidence.
traditionally
your
burden
of
proof
is
a
charge
to
the
jury,
but
the
trial
judge
admits
evidence
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
tends...
whether
a
reasonable
person
could
find
that
it
tended
to
prove
some
element
of
the
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
where
do
we
find
the
text
of
104(a)
in
your
brief?
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
you
say
the
rule
of
evidence
involved,
but
you
cite
only
104(b).
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
you
set
it
out...
you
set
out
only
104(b).
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
is
the
text
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
again
in
your
brief
at
the
beginning
you
say
the
rule
of
evidence
involved,
and
you
set
forth
only
104(b).
chief
justice
rehnquist
404(b).
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
these
the
same...
is
104(a)
and
104(b)
the
same
thing
as
404(a)
and
404(b)?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
aren't
these
set
forth
in
your
brief
if
you
are
going
to
rely
on
them?
chief
justice
rehnquist
whereabouts?
0....
well,
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
and
you
are
relying
both
on
104(a)
and
104(b)?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
the
traditional
trial
judge's
saying
the
proponent
offers
in
evidence
and
says,
i
will
connect
it
up
later?
in
other
words,
there
is
something
that
should
be
in
evidence
that
isn't
to
make
it
completely...
to
make
it
admissible,
and
the
trial
judge
says,
yes,
but
you
will
have
to
connect
it
up
later.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
doesn't
deal
with
a
standard
of
proof.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
tell
me
why
you
think
it
does.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
we
don't
get
that
surely
out
of
rule
101(b)
or
104(b).
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
provision
of
the
rules
did
professor
wright
rely
on
to
reach
his
opinion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
104(a)?
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
simply
doesn't
address
the
point
at
all,
so
far
as
i
can
tell.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
they
have
some
reasoning
that
hasn't
so
far
been
apparent
from
your
argument?
i
mean,
do
they
simply
rely
on
the
language
that
we
have
been
talking
about,
104(a)
and
(b)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ferris.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
bryson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
rule
means
at
all,
mr.
bryson.
judges
don't
traditionally
just
go
through
trials
and
when
someone
asks
them
to
make
a
finding
of
fact
like
that,
they
don't
go
ahead
and
make
findings
of
fact.
that...
404(b)
to
me
deals
with
a
situation
where
you
are
presenting
one
witness
and
you
want
to
get
him
off
the
stand
as
soon
as
you
can,
but
you
want
to
cover
everything
so
you
can
excuse
him.
he
is
going
to
testify
to
some
things
that
are
not
yet
tied
in,
but--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--and
another
witness
is
going
to
come
along
and
tie
it
in,
and
so
that
is
what
it
seems
to
me
that
conditional
admission
is
talking
about.
the
judge
doesn't
make
any
finding
under
rule
404(b).
chief
justice
rehnquist
104(b).
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
handle
that
on
voir
dire
ordinarily,
don't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
defense
attorney
is
entitled
to
examine
this
witness
to
see
if
he
has
a
sufficient
basis
for
concluding--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
your
submission
to
justice
white,
i
thought,
was
that
at
this
point
you
asked
the
judge
to
make
a
finding
of
fact.
i
don't
see
any
basis
for
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
ferris,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ferris.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
87-6
huddleston
against
united
states.
this
case
involves
the
rules
under
which
evidences
admitted
at
trial
under
federal
courts.
the
defendant
in
this
criminal
case,
guy
rufus
huddleston
was
charged
with
possessing
and
selling
stolen
video
cassette
tapes
in
interstate
commerce.
the
only
real
question
at
his
trial
was
whether
he
knew
the
tapes
were
stolen.
to
prove
this,
the
government
sought
to
introduce
an
evidence
at
trial
similar
acts
including
evidence
that
huddleston
had
previously
sold
for
$28
purportedly
new
television
sets
were
--
which
were
supplied
to
him
by
the
same
source
that
supplied
the
video
tapes
involved
in
this
case.
the
government's
theory
of
relevance
was
that
the
television
sets
were
stolen,
and
proof
that
huddleston
had
engaged
in
other
sales
of
stolen
merchandise
from
the
same
suspicious
source,
would
be
strong
evidence
that
he
knew
that
the
cassette
tapes
were
stolen
as
well.
the
district
court
admitted
the
evidence
under
federal
rule
of
evidence,
404(b)
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
the
conviction.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
contrary
to
the
claim
of
the
defendant,
we
hold
that
a
trial
court
need
not
make
its
own
preliminary
finding
that
the
similar
act
actually
happened
before
it
admits
evidence
to
this
effect.
similar
act
of
evidence
they
--
may
be
admitted
so
long
as
the
jury
can
reasonably
conclude
that
these
similar
acts
occurred,
and
so
long
as
it
complies
with
the
general
provisions
of
the
rules
such
as
those
requiring
a
balancing
of
the
relevance
of
the
evidence
against
the
possible
prejudice.
in
this
case,
the
jury
reasonably
could
have
concluded
that
the
defendant
had
previously
sold
stolen
television
sets
and
was
entitled
to
weigh
that
fact
against
him
in
determining
whether
the
video
cassette
tapes
involved
in
this
case
had
been
stolen.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
