justice
o'connor
i
thought
you
argued
for
a
clear
and
convincing
standard.
justice
o'connor
your
argument
is
so
different
than
that
which
i
thought
we
were
hearing
from
the
brief.
justice
o'connor
well,
you
no
longer
are
asking
us
to
require
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
then?
justice
o'connor
all
right.
justice
o'connor
and
so
i
thought
the
sixth
circuit
applied
some
preponderance
of
the
evidence
there.
justice
o'connor
so
you
are
saying
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed,
i
suppose.
justice
o'connor
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
that
they
could
have
found
a
preponderance
standard?
justice
o'connor
and
that's
what
your
argument
boils
down
to
now?
justice
o'connor
well,
let's
talk
about
rule
403.
doesn't
rule
403
require
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
prejudicial
effect
of
the
evidence
outweighs--
justice
o'connor
--the
probative
value.
justice
o'connor
right,
but
was
there
any
objection
raised
below
to
the
court's
treatment
of
rule
403
and
that
balancing?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
that
is
not
a
question
presented
on
certiorari
to
us,
is
it,
the
403
balancing?
justice
o'connor
all
right,
but
you
did
not
raise
some
improper
application
of
403
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
did
you?
justice
o'connor
okay.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
strength
of
the
evidence
must
be
considered
in
the
403
balancing
or
not?
justice
o'connor
so
you
think
the
trial
judge
has
to
make
a
separate
determination
of
whether
the
similar
acts
are
established
by
a
preponderance--
justice
o'connor
--before
letting
it
go
to
the
jury
and
then
make
another
assessment
of
the
strength
of
the
evidence
under
403.
justice
o'connor
does
the
strength
of
the
evidence
have
to
be
considered
in
making
the
403
balance,
mr.
bryson?
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
if
it
is
very
slender
evidence--
justice
o'connor
--and
highly
prejudicial--
justice
o'connor
--that
might
be
something
the
court
would
consider.
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
the
court
might
have
had
a
little
on
the
balancing
in
this
case,
i
would
think,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
isn't
much
to
show
knowledge
that
the
televisions
were
stolen,
is
there?
justice
o'connor
how
so?
why
don't
you
run
through
that
with
us?
