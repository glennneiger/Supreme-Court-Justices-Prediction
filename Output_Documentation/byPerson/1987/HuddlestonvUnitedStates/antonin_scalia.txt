justice
scalia
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that.
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
is
quite
different.
if
it
had
meant
that
it
would
have
said,
he
shall
admit
it
if
he
finds
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient.
it
doesn't
say,
if
he
finds.
it
said
sufficient
to
support
a
finding,
which
is
exactly
the
common
law
rule
the
chief
justice
is
referring
to.
could
a
reasonable
jury
find
it,
whether
he
thinks
so
or
not.
preponderance
is
his
making
the
judgment.
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
is
simply
a
reasonable
man
could
find
that.
justice
scalia
i
understand
that
that
is
your
position.
i
just
don't
see
how
you
get
it
from
the
language
of
104(b),
which
only
requires
evidence
sufficient
to
support
a
finding.
if
you
want
to
talk
about
damaging
evidence,
suppose
there
is
eyewitness
testimony
offered.
the
witness
is
called.
the
government
calls
the
witness,
and
he
saw
him.
he
says,
yes,
i
saw
this
man
shoot...
that
is
rather
damaging,
isn't
it,
and
yet
you
don't
let
the
trial
judge
try
out
that
issue,
whether
that
is
reliable
testimony
or
not,
before
it
goes
to
the
jury.
justice
scalia
mr.
ferris,
i
assume
that
your
argument
would
apply
to
everything
covered
by
404(b),
and
therefore
i
am
a
little
concerned
about
using
the
shorthand
"bad
evidence".
justice
scalia
it
isn't
all
bad.
you
say
this
stuff
is
so
inherently
inflammatory
there
has
been
a
common
law
bias
against
it,
but
it
isn't...
if
what
you
are
trying
to
show
is
that
this
individual
committed
burglary
ten
times
before,
i
suppose
you
could
call
that
bad
evidence,
but
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
that.
all
you
would
have
to
show,
let's
say,
in
a
case
where
there
has
been
a
theft
from
a
store,
you
might
just
want
to
show
that
in
the
preceding
ten
weeks
there
had
been
similar
items
missing
from
the
store,
and
on
the
day
those
items
were
missing,
every
one
of
those
days
this
individual
happened
to
be
in
the
store.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
inflammatory
about
the
fact
that
this
individual
was
in
the
store
once
a
week
for
the
preceding...
what
is
so
inflammatory
about
that
that
we
have
to
erect
a
special
rule
for
it?
justice
scalia
but
that...
404(b)
is
what
would
let
that
in,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
why
is
it...
i
mean,
why?
justice
scalia
for
the
other
one
you
could
at
least
justify
it
by
saying
it
is
very
inflammatory,
and
the
common
law
doesn't
like
people
to
be,
you
know,
prior
criminal
acts
to
be
brought
in
without
proving
that
they
actually
occurred.
but
i
am
not...
all
i'm
saying
is,
look,
part
of
what
the
jury
should
look
at
is,
this
guy
did
this
ten
weeks
before.
justice
scalia
it
seems
very
strange
to
me.
it
could,
be
even
that
this
individual,
the
person
who
committed
the
crime
wore
a
red
had,
and
you
want
to
introduce
evidence
that
this
fellow
had
often
been
seen
wearing
a
red
hat,
and
you
would
suddenly
invoke
this
preponderance
rule.
justice
scalia
evidence
of
other
crimes,
wrongs,
or
acts
that
is
not
admissible
to
prove
the
character.
it
may,
however,
be
admissible
for
other
purposes,
such
as
to
prove
motive,
opportunity,
intent,
preparation,
plan,
knowledge,
identity,
or
absence
of--
justice
scalia
i
have
forgotten
it
already.
justice
scalia
well,
assume
we
take
your
position
on
relevance,
that
if
the
evidence
is
relevant,
it
comes
in,
without
the
judge
doing
anything
else
but
saying
it
is
relevant.
justice
scalia
mr.
bryson,
i
gather
from
what
you
said
earlier
concerning
your
first
theory--
justice
scalia
--that
you
don't
think
that
each
similar
act
has
to
be
evaluated
on
its
own,
that
the
criterion
is
whether
a
reasonable
jury
could
find
on
the
basis
of
all
of
the
similar
acts
that
the
goods
were
stolen.
justice
scalia
by
which
i
mean
this.
you
have
in
your
brief
the
example
of
a
counterfeiting
prosecution--
justice
scalia
--and
you
show
that
the
individual
went
into
ten
different
stores,
and
each
one
of
those
ten
stores
had
a
$50
bill
in
the
cash
register
that
was
counterfeit
afterwards.
now,
i
am
not
sure
if
you
just
showed
one
of
those
that
i'd
say
that
that
was
enough
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
find,
but
you
would
not
do
them
one
by
one,
you
would
take
all
ten.
justice
scalia
you
don't
really
mind
that
antagonism
really
but
you
say
they
should
vent
it
through
the
other
provision
that
requires
balancing.
justice
scalia
in
some
cases
you
would
even
allow
that
that
balancing
would
lead
a
court
to
say
i
won't
let
it
in
unless
i
believe
by
a
preponderance
that
it
was
stolen.
justice
scalia
conceivably
a
judge
might
think
it
was
so
prejudicial
that
that's
the
standard
he'd
impose.
