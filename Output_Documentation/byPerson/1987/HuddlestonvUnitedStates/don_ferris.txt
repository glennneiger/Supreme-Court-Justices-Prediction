mr.
don
ferris
"fairis".
mr.
don
ferris
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
mr.
huddleston's
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
there
are
two
major
issues
facing
this
court
in
this
case.
first,
by
what
standard
of
proof
must
the
government
prove
that
the
defendant
engaged
in
a
prior
bad
act
before
it
may
be
admitted
under
federal
rules
of
evidence
404(b).
and
secondly,
if
such
evidence
is
erroneously
admitted,
which
harmless
error
test
should
govern
on
appellate
review,
the
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
test
enunciated
by
this
court
in
chapman
or
the
effect
on
substantial
rights
test
enunciated
by
this
court
in
kotteakos?
finally,
once
this
court
decides
which
standards
should
be
adopted
in
this
case,
the
court
must
apply
them
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
now,
petitioner
contends
that
the
trial
court
abused
its
discretion
in
admitting
petitioner's
involvement
in
the
sale
of
black
and
white
televisions
prior
to
the
sale
of
vhf
tapes
which
he
was
charged
with
when
the
government
did
not
prove
they
were
stolen
by
at
least
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
we
also
contend
that
the
jury's
hearing
about
these
tvs
was
not
harmless
error,
that
it
affected
his
substantial
rights
and
amounted
to
a
miscarriage
of
justice
under
the
kotteakos
standard.
i
will
concentrate
in
my
argument
on
the
standard
of
proof
question,
contending
that
both
rules
104(a)
and
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
require
that
the
government
show
that
the
prior
bad
act
was
committed
and
that
the
defendant
committed
it
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
then
i
intend
to
show
that
the
government
did
not
meet
this
standard
in
this
case,
that
they
did
not
show
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
these
tvs
were
stolen
or
that
the
defendant
knew
about
it.
and
finally
i
will
argue
that
the
erroneous
introduction
of
the
tvs
was
not
harmless,
that
it
did
affect
his
substantial
rights.
now,
this
court
is
faced
in
our
briefs
with
deciding
between
three
different
standards
of
proof.
first,
of
all,
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
proof
which
was
adopted
by
the
seventh,
eighth,
ninth,
and
d.c.
circuits.
many
federal
commentators
also
support
it,
as
did
our
position,
the
federal
common
law.
the
preponderance
of
evidence
test
has
been
supported
by
six
different
circuits,
using
the
104(b)
test,
and
if
this
case
is
analyzed
also
under
104(a)
i
believe
that
this
would
be
the
required
holding
of
the
court
under
the
recent
case
of
bourjaily,
and
if
i
am
not
pronouncing
that
correctly...
i
believe
the
case
is
bourjaily,
and
that
was
decided
by
this
court
last
summer.
the
government
argues
for
a
different
standard.
the
government
argues
that
a
trial
court
should
admit
this
evidence
when
there
is
a
basis
for
finding
that
the
defendant
committed
the
act.
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
absolutely
no
support
for
that--
mr.
don
ferris
--i
believe...
i
would
agree
with
that
but
there
stands
as
a
sentinel
to
deciding
this
rule
104(a)
or
(b),
whichever
one
applies.
mr.
don
ferris
i
cite
it--
mr.
don
ferris
--that's
correct,
and
in
my
brief
i
cite
104(a)
many
times.
mr.
don
ferris
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
don
ferris
i
actually
set
404(b).
mr.
don
ferris
404(b).
but
i
argue
numerous
times
in
my
brief
that
whichever
applies,
104(a)
or
104(b),
that--
mr.
don
ferris
--no,
104(a)
provides
that
preliminary
questions
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence
must
be
decided
by
the
court.
mr.
don
ferris
i
believe...
104(b)
is
specifically
stated
in
the
brief.
mr.
don
ferris
they
are
set
out
in
footnote
17
on
page
24
of
the
brief.
mr.
don
ferris
104(a)
and
104(b).
that's
correct.
in
104(a),
"preliminary
questions
concerning
the
admissibility
of
evidence
shall
be
determined
by
the
courts,
subject
to
the
provisions
of
subdivision
(b).
"
and
(b)
is
relevancy
conditioned
on
fact.
"when
the
relevancy
of
evidence
depends
on
the
fulfillment
of
a
condition
of
fact,
the
court
shall
admit
it
upon
the
introduction
of
evidence
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
of
the
fulfillment
of
the
condition.
"
mr.
don
ferris
no--
mr.
don
ferris
--that...
six
circuit
courts
of
appeal
have
held
that
it
does.
mr.
don
ferris
i
think
that
it
does
because
similar
acts
evidence
is
so
fraught
with
possible
prejudice
to
the
defendant
that
that
should
be
decided
by
the
courts
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
and
it
has
no
probative
value--
mr.
don
ferris
--104(b),
i
believe
that
introduction
of
evidence
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
of
the
fulfillment
of
a
condition
equals
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
don
ferris
it
is
our
position
that
it
must
be...
that
the
court
must
decide
that
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
by
at
least
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
or
it
has
no
probative
value,
that
the
jury
should
not
hear
about
it,
that
if
you
then
say
to
the
jury,
well,
just
ignore
this
later,
ignore
that
we
have
said
that
this
man
is
a
bad
man,
that
that
is
not
effective,
that
this
should
be
held
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
as
this
court
recognized
in
deciding
the
conspiracy
issue
in
bourjaily
under
104(a).
mr.
don
ferris
but
that
is
on
the
substantive
offense.
here
you
are
talking
about
evidence
that
is
disfavored.
it
has
always
been
disfavored
by
the
courts
in
the
federal
common
law.
this
court
in
the
boyd
case
back
in
1896
followed
the
exclusionary
rule
as
to
similar
acts
evidence.
mr.
don
ferris
he
could
do
that,
but
it
is
our
position
that
it
doesn't
have
sufficient
probative
value
to
go
to
the
jury
unless
you
prove
by
at
least
51
percent
of
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
committed
the
act,
that
it
is
too
fraught
with
prejudice
otherwise
to
be
admitted.
mr.
don
ferris
then
that
should
be
held
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
from
a
practical
standpoint,
it
generally
does
not
take
that
long.
mr.
don
ferris
if
the
court
finds...
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
court
finds
that
that
had
been
proven
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
by
51
percent
of
the
evidence,
so
that
it
is
probative,
then
yes,
then
it
goes
to
the
jury.
then
the
defendant
can
get
on
the
stand
and
dispute
that,
and
i
would
state
i
don't
believe--
mr.
don
ferris
--yes.
mr.
don
ferris
yes,
and
our
position
is
that
it
comes
out
of
rule
104(a).
mr.
don
ferris
pardon?
mr.
don
ferris
it
is...
questions
concerning
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
and
i
would
agree
with
professor
wright,
who
indicates
that
if
you
are
talking
about
whether
a
prior
bad
act
is
a
bad
act,
that
that
is
a
preliminary
question
that
should
be
decided
by
the
judge,
that
that
isn't
a
preliminary
question
of
fact,
that
the
government
is
introducing
it
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
the
bad
act
occurred.
mr.
don
ferris
104(a).
mr.
don
ferris
right.
mr.
don
ferris
he
reads
104(a)
and
104(b)
as
a
whole,
and
because
of
the
possible
prejudice
and
because
it
is
fraught
with
danger,
that
he
argues
and
i
argue
that
as
do
the
seventh,
eighth,
ninth,
and
d.c.
circuits,
and
as
do
every
circuit
court
in
this
country--
mr.
don
ferris
--yes,
they
equate
that
with
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
in
fact,
the
most
recent
case
is,
the
government
relied
on
the
first
circuit
in
developing
their
any
basis
test
under
a
case
called
d'alora,
and
since
we
wrote
our
initial
briefs,
the
first
circuit
came
down
with
a
case
called
ingraham
at
832
fed
2nd.
that
also
follows
the
second,
fourth,
fifth,
all
of
the
other
circuits
that
have
developed
a
preponderance
of
evidence
standard,
and
they
all
rely
on
104(b).
they
say
that
that
language,
introduction
of
evidence
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
of
the
fulfillment
of
a
condition,
equals
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
that's
our
position.
mr.
don
ferris
i
did
argue
for
a--
mr.
don
ferris
--it
is.
i
argued
clear
and
convincing
in
my
petition,
and
i
was
unaware...
in
fact,
my
petition
for
cert
was
in
the
mail
when
this
court
issued
its
opinion
in
bourjaily,
and
i
was
not
aware
of
bourjaily
when
i
wrote
my
initial
brief.
but
in
my
reply
brief
i
admit
that
bourjaily...
that
this
court
held
in
bourjaily
that
the
104(a)
standard,
which
had
never
been
ruled
on
before
because
it
doesn't
state...
nowhere
in
the
federal
rules
do
they
state
what
the
burden
of
proof
should
be.
mr.
don
ferris
i
am
no
longer
asking
that.
mr.
don
ferris
i
am
no
longer
asking
that,
because
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
don
ferris
--they
did
on
their
second...
on
rehearing
they
did
apply
the
preponderance
of
evidence.
mr.
don
ferris
no,
i'm
saying
that
the
sixth
circuit
also
was
incorrect
in
their
application
of
the
preponderance
of
evidence
standard.
i
don't--
mr.
don
ferris
--yes.
mr.
don
ferris
well,
it
is
also...
i'm
taking
the
position
for
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
because
i
believe
that
the
government's
position
of
any
basis
would
be
disastrous
to
criminal
defendants,
that
the
government
could
come
in
with
flimsy
similar
acts
evidence
and
say
this
evidence
should
come
in,
and
then
only
using
the
403...
the
government
argues
for
a
403
balancing
test.
mr.
don
ferris
the
probative
value.
mr.
don
ferris
403
specifically
states
that
the
evidence
comes
in
unless
the
prejudicial
effects
substantially
outweighs
the
probative
value,
which
i
find
very
different
than
a
straight
probative
prejudice
balancing.
mr.
don
ferris
there
was...
yes,
the
defense
counsel
on
joint
appendix
6
did
object.
there
was
no
balancing
below.
in
fact--
mr.
don
ferris
--the
403
only
is
from
a
standpoint
is
if...
the
government
is
arguing
that
that
is
what
the
standard
should
be,
is
no
standard,
just
403.
mr.
don
ferris
that's
correct.
mr.
don
ferris
that's
correct.
i
did
discuss
403
because
i
felt
that
the
government
would
raise
403.
mr.
don
ferris
i
think
that
the
first...
i
think
that
it
does,
but
i
think
that
the
first
step
that
must
be
done
is
that
you
don't
reach
the
403
balancing
until
you
decide
that
there
has...
that
the
similar
act
has
been
proven
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
don
ferris
yes,
i
do.
mr.
don
ferris
yes,
the
steps
that
i
have
argued
for,
and
i
argue
this
in
my
reply
brief
specifically,
is
that
first
the
evidence
has
to
be
shown
to
be
admitted
for
a
proper
purpose,
not
for
propensity,
but
for
one
of
the
proper
purposes
under
rule
404(b).
second,
that
has
to
be
at
issue.
now,
those
two
things
were
argued
in
this
case,
that
it
was
being
admitted
for
knowledge
and
the
defendant
admitted
that
the
issue
in
this
case
was
going
to
be
knowledge.
then
my
position
is
that
in
this
case,
where
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
the
bad
act
occurred
or
whether
the
bad
act
was
a
bad
act,
whether
the
tvs
were
stolen,
then
the
court
has
to
show
that...
it
has
to
be
shown
to
the
court
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
once
that
threshold
is
met,
then
he
applies
the
prejudice
versus
probative
value.
mr.
don
ferris
i
think
that
your
standard
is
the
correct
one,
reasonable.
reasonable.
that
is
the
same
standard
that
you
would
use--
mr.
don
ferris
--yes,
it
goes
to
the
trier
of
fact.
mr.
don
ferris
and
that
is
51
percent
of
the
evidence.
mr.
don
ferris
he
has
to
determine
that
a
trier
of
fact
could
make
that
finding,
yes,
that
a
reasonable
person
could
make
a
finding
of
51
percent
of
the
evidence.
mr.
don
ferris
my
position
is,
they
have
to
prove,
yes,
that
the
televisions
were
stolen
and
that
the
defendant
knew
that
they
were
stolen.
mr.
don
ferris
by
a
preponderance.
mr.
don
ferris
i
think
that's
all
they
proved.
the
only
evidence
they
have
about
these
tvs
is
that
they
were
sold
for
$28.
i
have
emphasized
in
my
brief
that
the
government
here
three
years
later
still
can't
prove
the
origin
of
those
tvs.
they
have
had
three
years
to
say
that
these
tvs
were
stolen,
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
they
can't
do
it.
mr.
don
ferris
no,
it
doesn't,
but
certainly
their
evidence
was
from
mr.
toney.
mr.
toney
indicated
that
guy
huddleston
went
to
him
and
said,
we've
got
a
good
deal
on
tvs.
my
friend,
an
attorney
with
a
license
to
practice
law
in
the
state
of
michigan,
has
770
of
these
tvs,
and
he
is
selling
them
right
out
of
his
store
in
xpsilanti.
mr.
don
ferris
no,
they
just
argued
that
it
was
relevant
to
show
his
knowledge.
this
issue
was
not
very
well--
mr.
don
ferris
--they
argued...
the
transcript
is
not
very...
the
hearing
was
not
very
long.
in
fact,
there
was
no
testimony
taken.
they
argued
that
all
of
these
items
were
stolen,
and
in
fact
i
think
they
argued
that
in
their
closing
argument,
that
all
of
these
items
were
stolen,
and
the
government
admitted
at
oral
argument
in
the
sixth
circuit
that
they
did
not
prove
it
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
but
took
the
position
that
they
did
prove
it
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
that
was
the
government's
position
in
this
sixth
circuit,
that
the
standard
should
be
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
they
have
switched
their
argument
before
this
court.
mr.
don
ferris
so
you
have
each
changed.
mr.
don
ferris
we
have
each
changed.
and
i
have
changed
because
i
believe
i
have
to
under
the
bourjaily
standard.
when
this
court
ruled,
i
was
not
aware
of
bourjaily,
and
when
this
court
ruled
under
104(a)
that
the
standard
should
be
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
i
don't
think
that
i
can
sit
here
before
this
court
and
argue
logically
that
104(b)
should
be
a
higher
standard
than
that.
mr.
don
ferris
right.
mr.
don
ferris
in
most
cases...
i
don't
believe
in
most
cases
that
that
is
the
sort
of
evidence
that
comes
in,
but
it
is
not--
mr.
don
ferris
--no
question,
and
in
fact
the
government
points
that
out.
404(b)
talks
about
similar
acts.
it
doesn't
talk
about
bad
acts.
it
talks
about
similar
acts.
but
in
that
case
i
still
think
that
if
there
is
a
question,
and
in
that
case
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
the
defendant
committed
the
acts,
and
then
it
should
be
shown
to
the
judge
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
by
a
preponderance
of
evidence
standard,
using
the
reasonable--
mr.
don
ferris
--because--
mr.
don
ferris
--my
position
is
under
104(b),
and
this
is
supported
by
every
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
united
states
that
that
is
what
that
language
means,
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
this
does
not
come
up
that
often
in
404(b)
cases,
this
issue.
most
of
the
time
the
government
can
show
that
the
defendant
committed
the
act,
or
that
the
act
was
bad.
i
would
say
this
might
come
up
in
20,
25
percent
of
the
cases.
in
major
cases,
though,
where
there
are
serial
acts
like
you
bring
up,
for
example,
the
wayne
williams
case,
where...
you
know,
a
classic
case--
mr.
don
ferris
--no,
it...
no,
i
believe
that...
no,
because
that...
well,
if
you
pigeonhole
it
under
identity.
if
you
pigeonhole
it
under
identity,
yes,
i
believe--
mr.
don
ferris
--right,
if
it
is
pigeonholed
under
the
identity,
but
at
some
point
you
are
talking
about...
you
go
into
part
of
the
res
gestae,
which
is...
the
government
argued
in
their
brief
as
a
fallback
position
that
this
shouldn't
even
be
analyzed
under
a
similar
act
evidence,
that
these
tvs
should
come
in
because
it
showed
that
mr.
huddleston
was...
if
these
tvs
were
not
stolen,
if
this
court
adopts
a
standard
of
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
if
these
tvs
were
not
shown
to
be
stolen
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
they
should
have
come
in
anyway,
because
it
shows
that
mr.
huddleston
had
a
habit,
not
a
habit,
but
had
been
selling
things
throughout
the
state
of
michigan
that
were
of
questionable
character.
that
was
their
fallback
position,
and
i
think
at
some
point
you
get
into
a
res
gestae,
and
you
don't
have
to
analyze
it.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
before
this
court.
i
think
that...
that
argument
was
first
raised
before
this
court
as
a
fallback
position.
the
only
way
to...
i
believe
that
this
is
a
conditional
question
or
a
conditional
fact
that
must
be
decided
by
the
judge,
and
as
a
result
that
104(b)
comes
into
play,
and
that
stands
as
a
sentinel,
in
the
words
of
the
judge
who
wrote
ingraham,
which
reversed
the
government's
argument.
again
i
indicate
that
the
first
circuit
was
the
only
circuit
to
follow
the
government's
position,
and
all
the
other
circuits
have
indicated
that
104
should
be
the
standard,
that
it
has
not
been
shown
in
this
case
when
all
the
government
can
show
is
that
these
tvs
were
being
sold
for
$28,
and
in
fact
if
you
use
all
of
the
evidence
there
was
an
attorney
licensed
to
practice
in
the
state
of
michigan
who
said
he
had
a
bill
of
sale
for
these
tvs
and
sold
them
right
out
of
his
store.
the
last
issue
is
that
if
this
court
agrees
with
my
analysis
and
also
agrees
that
there
was
not
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
then
you
have
to
reach
the
harmless
error
standard,
and
i
would
admit
to
the
court
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
harmless
error
standard
in
nonconstitutional
claims,
and
i
am
not
claiming
that
this
is
a
nonconstitutional
claim,
should
be
by
the
chapman
rule,
should
be
by
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
sixth
circuit
applied
both
standards
in
their
opinions.
they
first
said,
in
the
first
opinion,
a
two-one
decision
reversing
mr.
huddleston's
conviction,
they
said
that
it
hadn't
been
proven...
that
it
hadn't
been
proven
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
then
they
also
said,
though,
that
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
objection
raised
here,
and
they
analyzed
the
case
under
a
plain
error
standard
under
rule
52(b),
which
i
take
the
position
that
the
plain
error
standard
is
the
same
as
the
kotteakos
standard.
mr.
don
ferris
that
was
the
panel
opinion,
two-one,
that
they
indicated
that
there
was
plain
error.
mr.
don
ferris
on
rehearing
they
indicated
that
there
was
not?
mr.
don
ferris
two
of
them...
yes,
two
of
them
switched
their
votes.
in
fact,
they
indicated
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
reach
that
issue.
mr.
don
ferris
yes,
because--
mr.
don
ferris
--they
did.
mr.
don
ferris
they
said
that
it
was
harmless
error
under
the
kotteakos
standard.
mr.
don
ferris
and
this
court
can
review
that
under
united
states
versus
hastings,
because
again
that
was
not
cited
at
the
trial
court
level,
that
this
court
can
rule
on
harmless
error,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
was
a
close
case.
there
were
two
counts
here.
mr.
huddleston
was
convicted
of
one
count.
he
was
acquitted
of
the
other
count.
the
first
count
he
was
convicted
of
was
on
an
april
19th
sale.
the
second
count
he
was
convicted
of
was
on
an
23rd
possession.
the
only
evidence
showing
his
knowledge
before
those
tapes
were
these
tvs.
the
jury
was
out
for
two
days,
and
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
cannot
say
with
fair
assurance
that
it
did
not
have
a
substantial
influence
on
the
verdict
when
it
was
the
only
evidence
showing
mr.
huddleston's
knowledge
before
he
sold
these
tapes.
all
those
other
things
occurred
a
week
later
with
agent
nelson,
the
amana
appliances
and
the
tvs
and
movies,
and
for
that
reason
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
don
ferris
your
honor,
the
government
does
admit
104(b)
comes
into
play
in
these
cases,
and
they
should
because
the
advisory
committee
notes
to
401
recognize
the
distinction
between
logical
relevancy
under
401
and
conditional
relevancy
under
104.
and
rule
402
merely
states
that
relevant
evidence
is
admissible
except
as
otherwise
provided
for
by
other
rules.
104(a)...
it
is
our
position
that
104(a)
applies
here
but
if
104(b)
applies
that,
six
different
circuits
have
ruled
that
the
preponderance
of
evidence
test
is
what
that
rule
means.
mr.
don
ferris
yes,
i
misspoke
to
justice
white.
i
believe
that
the
jury...
i
mean,
that
the
judge
has
to
find
that
before
it
is
submitted.
mr.
don
ferris
yes.
the
preponderance
should
be
decided
by
the
judge
because
of
the
prejudicial
nature
of
the
evidence,
and
justice
scalia
asked
about
rule
403.
there
are
some
commentators,
notably
weinstein,
who
indicates
that
403
should
be
a
sliding
scale,
that
the
more
prejudicial
the
evidence,
that
the
higher
the
standard
of
proof
should
be
that
it
occurred.
there
is
also
a
very
good
article
on
that
in
the
notre
dame
law
review
written
by
a
man
named
sharp.
mr.
don
ferris
no,
the
governments
argues
that
it
is
a
straight
403
balancing,
which...
and
we
disagree.
403
indicates
that
the
probative
value...
that
the
prejudicial
effect
has
to
substantially
outweigh
the
probative
value,
and
that
is
not
what
the
notes...
the
advisory
committee
notes
say
in
rule
404.
they
say
no
mechanical
determination
is...
we
don't
suggest
any
mechanical
determination.
