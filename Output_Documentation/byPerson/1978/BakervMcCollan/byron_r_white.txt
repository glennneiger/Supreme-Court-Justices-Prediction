justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
--
i
think
it's
your
position
here
is
though
that
even
no
matter
how
negligent
the
sheriff
might
have
been
and
then
you
say
he
wasn't
negligent
at
all,
no
matter
how
negligent
he
might've
been
1983
just
doesn't
reach
that
kind
of
conduct.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
not,
not
this
maybe,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
there
was
a
failure
to
exercise
a
reasonable
care
here
to
ascertain
whether
they
have
the
right
man.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
known
duty
is
the
--
the
duty
not
to
hold
somebody
without
probable
cause
to
believe
he
has
committed
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
say
you
should
take
reasonable
care
and
to
validate
that
duty?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
there
wasn't
those
reasonable
steps
taken
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
say,
just
suppose
there
weren't
--
i
suppose
that
was
conceded
but
there
were
not
reasonable
steps
taken
to
identify
the
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
and
that's
part
of
the
question
but
you
know
you're
not
supposed
to
arrest
the
wrong
man.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
suppose
there's
an
unreasonable
--
there
is
a
failure
to
take
reasonable
steps
to
identify
the
person
you're
arresting?
now,
let's
just
suppose
there
was
an
--
a
failure
to
take
those
kind
of
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that
when
1983
would
reach
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
really
think
that's
where
the
burden
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
saying
at
least
you're
saying
at
some
point
in
time
after
repeated
the
assertions
that
on
--
that
you
got
the
wrong
man.
there
was
some
kind
of
duty
to
look
around
at
sometime.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
some
point
he
determined
that
he
did
not
have
the
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
sheriff
could
arrest
the
wrong
man
on
a
warrant
and
where
there's
probable
cause
like
you
say
there
is
here.
he
arrests
him,
puts
him
in
his
car,
he
takes
him,
as
soon
as
he
walks
through
the
jail
house
door.
he's
violated
the
constitutional
rights
if
he's
the
wrong
man.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
his
duty
isn't
to
have
only
the
right
man,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
alright,
i'll
say
set
off
to
pick
fingerprints
and
the
answer
came
back
yes,
this
is
the
right
man.
and
in
fact,
they
made
a
mistake
on
the
other
hand.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
about
the
sheriff?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
alright,
but
he
still
got
the
wrong
man
so
his
duty
isn't
just
to
have
the
wrong
man,
is
it
or
to
have
the
right
man?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
different.
