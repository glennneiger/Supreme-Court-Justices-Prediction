mr.
sorelle,
can
i
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
test
what
you're
saying
for
minute?
the
standard
whether
its
deliberate
indifference
or
negligence
or
intention
or
so
forth,
where
do
we
look
to
see
what
that
standard
is?
do
we
look
to
the
constitutional
violation
that
says
you
shouldn't
put
a
man
in
jail
without
a
trail
and
so
forth
or
do
we
look
in
1983
which
says
in
effect
if
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
you
may
recover
or
do
we
look
to
the
defense
of
good
faith
immunity?
there's
a
sort
of
three
different
places
that
standard
could
be
found.
where
do
you
say
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
we'll
have
to
find
out
whether
it's
negligence
or
deliberate
indifference
or
what?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
but
is
there
anything
in
1983
on
this
subject
at
all?
it
simply
says
that
does
not
that
if
there's
a
constitutional
violation
of
first
and
of
course
injury
has
a
remedy.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
on
january
2nd,
he
got
back
to
potter
county
on
december
30th?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
then
didn't
he
then
protest
that
he
was
the
wrong
man
and
didn't
they
then
have
fingerprints
available
right
there?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
at
that
point
it
was
under
the
jurisdiction
the
sheriff's
office
at
least.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
your
theory
was
that
this
man
had
been
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
in
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
those
--
that
material
didn't
do
him
any
good
when
he
sent
his
deputy
over
to
dallas
to
pick
the
man
up.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
this
is
true
of
every
warden
in
a
penitentiary.
justice
william
o.
douglas
alright.
all
you're
saying
as
i
understand
it
is
that
if
somebody
files
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
says,
i'm
being
detained
without
lawful
authority
unless
the
warden
can
show
his
authorities
and
tell
to
get
out.
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
larson,
he
doesn't
even
have
the
burden
to
show
he
was
unjust.
he
says
i'm
incarcerated.
nobody
has
a
right
incarcerate
me,
period.
if
he
says
that
he
gets
out
unless
the
warden
comes
in
explain
why
he
is
there.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand
but
the
word,
i
mean
the
sheriff
who
have
meant
his
burden
initially
by
saying,
well
i
arrest
him
pursuant
to
a
warrant
but
that's
all
and
then
the
burden
shifted
back
to
you
and
say,
well,
yes
but
you
got
the
wrong
man.
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
larson,
is
there
also
the
third
alternative?
i
don't
see
them
ever
referred
to
this
when
they
got
him
back
to
potter
county
that
there
was
--
and
he
was
still
protesting
he
was
the
wrong
man
to
the
person
there
then
a
duty
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
to
compare.
i
mean,
that's
different
alternative
as
i
understand
your
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
larson,
would
it
be
correct
if
the
issue
really
is
whether
the
constitutional
violation
deprivation
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
are
you
in
effect
arguing
that
the
constitutional
requirement
of
due
process
requires
that
when
a
man
is
arrested
and
protest
his
innocence
in
all
arrest
there
is
a
part
of
the
procedure
that
the
police
must
follow
is
to
check
reliable
sources
to
identify.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
it
simply
it
proceed
the
constitutional
violation
was
the
failure
to
accord
due
process
which
means
a
failure
to
check
this
man's
identity
when
it
was
appropriate
to
do
so.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
if
you
don't
look
at
negligence
or
good
faith
or
any
of
the
stuff,
do
we?
justice
william
o.
douglas
isn't
even
that,
is
it
mr.
larson,
his
duty
to
follow
a
procedure
which
will
reasonably
identify
the
man
as
being
the
right
man,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
you
say
didn't
follow
the
right
procedure?
that's
what
the
due
process
clause
is
all
about,
procedure.
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
brother
mr.
larson,
we're
not
really
talking
about
the
arrest
anymore
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
complaint
is
rather
the
procedure
is
eradicate
and
you
change
the
procedure
but
if
your
man
is
set
up
being
over
the
weekend
had
been
in
mexico
for
two
weeks
presumably
the
man
would
stay
in
jail
for
two
weeks
until
the
sheriff
get
back
and
you
made
precisely
the
same
argument
as
long
as
he
found
out
he
let
him
out.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what's
the
difference
between
three
days
and
13
days?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
he
didn't
make
adequate
procedures
for
identifying
people
who
have
been
arrested.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
right
and
those
procedures
if
the
sheriff
had
been
gone
for
three
weeks
under
those
procedures,
this
man
ought
to
stay
in
jail
for
three
weeks.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
if
you
say
this
why
didn't
they
do
as
soon
as
they
picked
him
up
and
brought
to
move
to
--
