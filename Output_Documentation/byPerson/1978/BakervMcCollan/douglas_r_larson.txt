mr.
douglas
r.
larson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
your
honor,
i
don't
know
and
i
don't
believe
my
client
knows.
it's
quite
possible
the
record
has
several
situations
under
which
my
client
obtained
driver's
license.
it's
quite
possible
that
his
brother
may
have
stolen
a
copy
of
one
of
his
several
driver's
license.
in
fact,
if
you
read
the
cross-examination
by
them
you'll
find
that
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
and
the
trial
court
had
several
driver's
licenses
and
he'd
prone
as
he
was
to
lose
them.
he
applied
for
more
and
it's
quite
possible,
i
would
think
that
brother
leonard
stole
one
of
them
but
we
don't
know
and
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
and
my
client
has
insisted
from
the
very
beginning
that
he
doesn't
know
how
leonard
got
his
driver'
license.
i
want
to
say
one
other
thing.
this
isn't
in
the
record
but
my
client's
parents
were
functionally
illiterate
and
the
mistakes
on
his
birth
certificate
were
due
to
their
illiteracy
and
nothing
else.
he
was
told
all
during
his
life
that
his
birthday
was
the
date
that's
on
the
driver's
license.
at
least
that's
my
understanding
of
it
and
in
addition
to
that,
his
name
was
misspelled
because
of
mother
then
didn't
know
how
to
spell
very
well.
now,
i
believe
this
case
is
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
he
says
that
his
birth
certificate
has
l-i-n-n-e-y
on
it
not
l-i-n-n-i-e.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
what
his
contention
is.
i
don't
think
when
congress
passed
1983,
they
passed
the
statute
and
back
in.
i
think
that
their
--
when
they
passed
the
statute
they
recognized
that
there
were
certain
tort
principles
that
were
going
to
be
engrafted
on
the
statute.
and
at
the
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes,
it
was.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
i
believe
that
there
were
some
questions
before
congress
whether
or
not
negroes
were
being
properly
treated
by
the
law
enforcement.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes.
but
that
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
the
statute
was
--
one
that
was
originally
passed.
i
believe
it
was
directed
for
the
--
against
the
southern
states
for
their
actions
against
negroes.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes,
sir.
i
believe
we
do.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
because
i
don't
like
to
try
this
kind
of
case
is
in
the
state
courts
of
texas,
your
honor.
the
judges
are
not
very
favorable
to
this
kind
of
cases
there.
i
have
attempted
to
exercise
the
constitutional
rights
of
several
people
in
state
courts
and
i
have
found
some
of
the
judges
to
be
somewhat
less
than
receptive
or
as
receptive
as
they
ought
to
be.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes,
sir.
when
congress
passes
the
statute,
this
was
not
done
in
a
vacuum.
it
was
done
with
the
idea
that
there
were
some
causes
of
action
that
were
automatically
going
to
be
engrafted
because
of
the
development
of
the
common
law,
we're
going
to
be
automatically
engrafted
in
1983.
now,
this
court
has
already
recognized
in
couple
of
cases
in
pierson
versus
ray,
in
monroe
versus
pape,
false
arrest
case
but
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
had
before
it
a
false
imprisonment
case
and
it
issues
and
or
a
little
different
in
that
--
in
a
false
arrest
case,
you
can
use
the
defense
of
good
faith.
but
i
don't
think
that
applies
in
a
false
imprisonment
case.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct
and
i
also
believe
that
the
constitution
requires
that
the
sheriff
in
this
case
arrest
only
the
persons
that
are
actually
warranted
pursuant
to
the
warrant
just
because
he
has
a
warrant
it
says,
“arrest
linnie
mccollan.”
that
doesn't
get
him
off
the
hook
because
he
had
the
information
which
would've
corrected
the
situation.
he
had
the
fingerprints
and
the
photographs
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
right.
but
he
was
under
a
duty,
a
constitutional
duty
to
imprison
only
those
that
have
--
that
are
to
be
lawfully
imprisoned.
now,
---
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
no,
sir.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
there's
a
lot
of
false
arrest
case
that
occurred
between
private
parties
and
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
if
there's
a
--
there's
an
underlying
constitutional
requirement
to
effectuate
liberty,
yes.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes.
alright,
i
think
it's
helpful
that
if
we
--
when
we
study
this
case
if
we
look
at
the
law
of
torts
because
the
law
of
torts
gives
us
some
guidance
on
how
to
establish
these
cases.
pierson
versus
ray
and
monroe
both
teach
us
that
the
background
of
tort
liability
is
to
be
used
in
helping
to
decide
1983
cases.
now,
as
i
understand
it
he's
saying
that
there's
no
intent
here
under
the
common
law
false
imprisonment.
the
only
intent
that
was
required
is
the
intent
to
imprison.
well,
there's
certainly
is
an
intent
to
imprison
here
because
the
plaintiff
was
imprinted
--
imprison.
in
addition
to
that,
the
common
law
and
his
--
in
a
restatement
of
tort
says
that
a
warrant
can
be
relied
on
to
a
certain
point
but
the
sheriff
or
the
jailer
has
to
use
due
diligence
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
he
is
arresting
is
the
person
he
actually
wants.
in
this
case,
the
sheriff
had
the
fingerprints
and
the
photographs
of
the
right
person
but
he
made
no
effort
until
several
days
later
to
compare
it.
and
this
is
not
clear
in
the
record
as
to
how
the
sheriff
finally
came
around
to
--
but
in
the
plaintiff's
deposition
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes,
but
he
did
have
it
yes
sir.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes
but
he
had
the
fingerprints.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes,
sir.
and
he
had
the
photographs.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
right,
it's
in
the
record.
in
fact,
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
and
it
would
been
easy
for
the
deputies
to
take
the
pictures
when
they
came
from
potter
county
down
to
dallas,
it
have
been
easy
to
compare
it
because
they
don't
even
look
alike.
leonard
and
linnie
don't
look
anything
like.
in
fact,
i
don't
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
i
understand
that
but
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
the
fifth
circuit
concluded
in
its
opinion
that
there
were
no
--
that
they
weren't
alike,
that
you
could
easily
tell
it.
but
in
addition
to
that
we
have
the
plaintiffs
and
the
trial
court
telling
he
wasn't
the
right
one.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
the
sheriff
baker's
predecessor
in
office
took
the
driver's
license
away
from
leonard
when
he
arrested.
his
office
did
and
they
knew
it
was
a
phony
driver's
license
because
they
took
it
up.
they
checked
the
department
of
public
safety
and
they've
realized
that
it
was
a
phony
driver's
license
but
they
made
no
effort
to
change
anything.
they
knew
he
was
operating
under
some
wrong
name
and
they
knew
that
one
has
driver's
license.
so,
they
took
it
up
and
they
had
leonard's
picture
on
the
driver's
license
and
but
it
was
linnie's
driver's
license
not
leonard's.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes,
sir
but
i'm
not
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
no,
and
i'm
not
and
i
haven't
maintained
that
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
your
honor.
i
did
not
maintain
that.
i
said
that
the
duty
sheriff
baker's
duty
arose
at
the
time
that
the
fingerprints
and
the
mug
shots
would've
been
mail
to
dallas.
i
can
see
that
the
arrest
was
--
is
justified
under
circumstances
but
the
sheriff
had
to
use
due
diligence
to
determined
they
have
the
right
man.
the
burden
that
someone
is
in
jail
and
wants
to
get
out
shouldn't
be
place
upon
the
person
who
is
in
the
jail,
it
was
to
be
placed
upon
the
person
who's
causing
to
be
there
and
that
person
is
one
who
should
be
the
person
who
has
the
duty
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
is
the
one
that
he's
suppose
to
have.
and
in
this
case,
sheriff
baker
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
if
the
person
who
is
imprisoning,
the
plaintiff
has
the
fingerprints
and
the
mug
shots,
he
has
an
obligation
to
check.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
he's
under
a
duty
to
constantly
check
his
authority
for
holding
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
the
presumption
is
on
him
because
the
constitution
said
he
can't
deprive
somebody
without
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
no,
sir,
i'm
not
saying
the
presumption
is
against
the
validity
of
their
imprisonment
but
i'm
saying
that
the
duty
is
upon
the
jailer
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
right
because
the
person
incarcerated
doesn't
have
anyway
to
get
access
to
the
records.
he
has
to
rely
on
the
jailer.
the
jailer
is
the
one
who
has
the
control.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
not
immediately
because
he
has
the
leisure
by
which
he
can
go
back
and
check
on
a
daily
basis.
he's
not
in
immediate
duty
to
do
it
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
quite
frankly,
on
our
suspect
that
almost
everybody
in
jails
thinks
they
ought
not
to
be
there.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
but
yes,
i
think
the
constitution
requires
a
jailer
to
know
the
authority
for
a
--
whom
we
hopes
and
to
be
constantly
checking
and
verifying
it
so
that
he
can
determine
when
his
person
is
suppose
to
be
released.
the
duty
--
to
place
the
duty
on
the
person
incarcerated
would
not
make
any
sense
because
he
has
no
access
to
the
records
and
he
has
--
no
access
to
the
key
to
let
him
out.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes,
he
does
but
all
he
has
to
show
is
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes.
yes,
i
did.
i
agree
he
has
a
burden.
he
only
has
to
show
he's
incarcerated
and
that
the
prison
for
holding
was
unjust
and
that's
what
he
did
in
this
case.
but
then
the
burden
switched,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
no,
the
client
in
this
case
established
that
it
wasn't
justified
to
hold
him
because
the
sheriff
failed
in
his
duty
to
determine
they
only
have
the
right
people.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
right.
but
the
common
law
says
that
you
can't
rely
and
hold
on
a
warrant.
you
got
to
use
all
the
information
at
your
hands
and
use
due
diligence
to
be
sure
you've
got
the
same
one.
and
for
example
just
because
we
had
two
gentlemen
named
warren
burger
who
were
wanted
for
arrest
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
--
and
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
no,
offense
intended.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
alright,
i
will
change
example
to
john
smith.
let's
suppose
we
have
two
people
named
john
smith,
one
who
had
not
committed
a
crime
and
one
who
had.
the
person
who's
executing
the
warrant
would
be
under
a
duty
to
ascertain
which
john
smith
he's
suppose
to
arrest.
now,
he
may
not
be
able
to
ascertain
that
until
he
gets
him
to
the
penitentiary
or
jail
and
checks
out
his
records,
or
he
may
not
have
any
way
to
check
him
out.
but
he's
got
to
use
all
the
information
at
his
hand
to
be
sure
he's
got
the
right
one.
you
just
can't
arrest
somebody,
anybody
because
their
name
have
to
be
the
same.
imagine,
there's
somewhere,
there's
a
warrant
for
douglas
larson
somewhere
and
--
but
i've
done
anything
that
i
know
of
and
i
don't
think
the
sheriff
ought
to
be
able
to
arrest
me.
his
got
--
he's
got
to
be
sure
he's
got
the
right
one.
i
suspect
that
almost
everyone
has
a
name
somewhere
there's
a
warrant
for
it
whether
or
not
he
is
the
one
wanted
or
not.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes
but
the
claim
is
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
right
the
plaintiff
did
in
this
case.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
i
understand,
but
plaintiff
did
in
this
case.
the
plaintiff
did
in
this
case.
he
showed
the
sheriff
had
the
fingerprints
and
the
photographs
of
the
right
person.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
no,
he
couldn't
--
he
didn't
have
access
to
the
records.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
he
says,
i'm
not
the
one,
there's
a
mistake.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
it's
inadmissible
because
of
the
--
because
the
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
i
would
suspect
that's
true
but
that
doesn't
relieve
a
person
who
places
him
in
jail
the
burden
of
determining
that
he
has
the
right
person.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
i'm
not
complaining
about
the
arrest.
i'm
complaining
about
the
false
arrest.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
the
arrest
was
made
pursuant
to
a
warrant.
the
sheriff
testified
that
the
standard
was
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
no.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
record,
you
would
say
that
when
i
asked
the
jury
when
i
submitted
my
interest
to
the
jury
my
question
for
the
jury
was,
did
the
sheriff
make
a
reasonable
ask,
did
he
reasonably
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
a
lawful
authority
to
hold
the
plaintiff?
now,
there's
another
issue
is
to
when
that
matter
taking
place.
i
submit
that
united
states
mail
over
take
perhaps
24
hours
for
the
photographs
and
fingerprints
to
be
mailed
from
potter
county
down
to
dallas.
i
would
concede
up
to
that
point
of
time
that
we
have
no
case.
it's
only
after
the
sheriff
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
no.
i'm
not
complaining
about
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
was
arrested.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
no.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
the
sheriff
testified
that
the
standard
is
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
that
was
a
jury
question
and
we
never
got
in
answered,
your
honor.
the
question
in
my
mind
is,
it's
probably
24
hours
or
enough
time
to
allow
the
sheriff
of
potter
county
to
mail
the
fingerprints
and
the
warrant
to
dallas
and
i
would
assume
that
would
take
24
hours.
it
also
could
occur
at
a
different
time.
the
sheriff
said
there
is
also
a
duty
on
the
deputies
who
left
potter
county
and
came
to
dallas
to
take
the
fingerprints
and
mug
shots
with
him
but
they
didn't
do
it.
now,
the
jury
could
decide
which
one
of
those
terms
is
more
reasonable.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
i
think
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
makes
an
assertion
that
he
want
anyone's
help
but
i
don't
think
that's
determinable
of
the
case.
i
think
the
sheriff
has
a
duty
to
be
sure
he's
got
the
right
one
and
to
exercise
due
diligence
(voice

--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
right,
it's
probably
because
a
(inaudible)
the
plaintiff
in
jail
and
said
that's
not
the
man
and
went
down
told
the
sheriff,
however
the
records
are
not
clear
on
that.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
he
said,
i'm
not
the
one,
there's
a
mistake.
in
fact,
he
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
he
didn't
have
any,
he
didn't
know.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
he
didn't
know
whether
it
was
his
brother
or
not.
i
guess
he
might
have
assumed
that
his
brother
has
done
something,
then
he
was
going
to
be
arrested
for
but
he
didn't
know.
he
was
--
throughout
the
entire
course
of
this
litigation,
he
has
maintained
he
had
no
knowledge
of
what
his
brother
was
doing
or
not
doing
in
potter
county.
to
my
way
of
thinking,
the
more
interesting
issue
or
more
sexy
issue,
if
you
pardon
my
expression,
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
sheriff
is
entitled
to
the
defense
of
good
faith.
well,
in
this
case
we
have
a
sheriff
who
didn't
do
anything.
in
fact,
he's
saying
that
i've
got
a
right
to
be
a
fool
and
not
in
--
i've
got
a
right
to
be
a
fool
and
i
don't
have
any
professional
or
statutory
or
constitutional
responsibility.
to
be
sure,
i've
got
the
right
man
in
jail.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
true.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
i
think
the
issues
that
this
petitioner
find
here
covered
that
issue.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
i
agree.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
i
still
don't
believe
that
the
sheriff
is
entitled
of
defense
of
good
faith
here.
i
think
good
faith
applies
to
a
false
arrest
case
like
the
one
who's
in
pierson
versus
ray
where
the
sheriff
--
where
the
arresting
officer
has
a
right
to
rely
on
the
--
what
he
believes
the
law
to
be.
but
in
this
situation,
i
think
the
sheriff's
duty
is
clear.
he
has
a
duty
to
incarcerate
only
those
persons
which
he
has
the
lawful
authority
to
do
so.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
my
position.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
all
warrant's
command
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
i
trust
that
he
would
do
something
to
try
to
narrow
down
which
john
doe
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
i
would
assume
then
that
the
sheriff
is
under
the
duty
to
arrest
the
john
doe
that
they
find
in
that
address.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
no,
sir.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
unless
there
were
some
other
information
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
yes,
sir
but
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
i'm
not
complaining
about
the
arrest,
justice
marshall.
i'm
complaining
about
the
failure
of
the
sheriff
to
verify
his
information
against
the
plaintiff
who
was
there
and
his
--
or
there
is
subject
to
his
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
i
don't
think
you
even
matters
whether
or
not
he
says,
i'm
not
the
man
or
not.
i
think
the
duty
is
still
on
the
sheriff.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
to
make
sure
he
is
the
right
one.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
my
position,
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
the
common
law
saw
that
problem
because
that's
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
rule
that
if
the
person
who's
about
to
be
arrested
says
that
well,
then
he
has
a
--
then
the
person
who
effectuates
the
false
imprisonment
is
let
off
the
hook.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
no,
sir.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
because
the
duty
is
on
him
to
verify
that
he
has
the
right
person
and
he
didn't
do
that
duty
nor
did
he
issue
any
regulations
in
his
department.
he
didn't
do
anything.
he
merely
just
sat
by
and
issued
no
regulations.
i
think
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
that's
a
different
case.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
i
think
the
sheriff's
duties
are
clear.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
a
jailer
or
a
sheriff
has
a
certain
duty.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
it
involves
knowing
--
it
involves
no
discretion,
the
duty
is
clear.
a
governor
has
discretion.
he
can
make
his
decision
based
on
several
things
and
his
failure
to
act
or
his
agreement
to
act,
i
don't
think
makes
--
get
allows
him
to
use
good
faith
as
a
defense.
but
a
jailer,
his
duty
is
clear.
imprison
only
the
right
person.
check
your
information
on
a
daily
basis
and
be
sure
you
don't
keep
anybody
longer
than
suppose
to.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
no,
sir.
as
soon
i
will
give
a
sheriff
a
latitude
of
--
a
latitude
in
time,
enough
time
to
check
whatever
--
what
other
information
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
it's
after
a
reasonable
time
it
is.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well,
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
well
that
would
be
on
his
rim
or
responsibility
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
the
duty
is
to
use
as
much
information
he
has
at
hand.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
r.
larson
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that,
your
honor.
unless,
there's
no
further
questions
thank
you.
