mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
respondent
brought
this
section
1983
action
alleging
a
violation
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
the
facts
are
basically
uncontroverted.
respondent
was
born
december
8,
1949
and
originally
given
the
name
linny
spelled
l-i-n-n-y,
c-a-r-r-o-l-l,
mccollon
with
an
o-n.
he
informally
adopted
the
name
in
which
he
uses
today
in
this
proceeding
with
the
different
spelling
of
linnie,
middle
name
carl,
and
mccollan
with
an
a-n.
the
date
of
birth
significant
only
because
later
in
by
1972
respondent
had
a
texas
driver's
license
identifying
him
as
linnie
carl
mccollan
and
through
error
the
birth
date
of
december
8,
1948
was
inserted
and
even
though
he
knew
of
it
did
not
correct
it
and
therefore
it
became
part
of
his
assumed
identity.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
no
one
that
we
know
of,
your
honor.
these
facts
would
not
be
particularly
significant
except
for
the
remarkable
coincidence
and
i
say
a
coincidence
because
that's
all
the
record
will
support
that
respondent's
older
brother
whose
true
name
was
leonard
decided
in
1972
to
adopt
the
identical
assumed
name
and
went
so
far
as
to
seek
a
duplicate
driver's
license
in
the
name
of
linnie
carl
mccollan.
unfortunate,
through
some
error
of
department
of
public
safety
the
same
was
issued
and
older
brother
leonard
had
a
driver's
license
but
identified
him
as
linnie
carl
mccollan
date
of
birth
december
8,
1948.
all
information
is
the
same
including
the
driver's
license
number
being
identical
but
the
only
difference
in
the
two
driver's
license
is
being
the
photographs
on
the
license
themselves.
then
unfortunately,
leonard
posing
his
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
yes,
sir.
probably,
i
think
you're
absolutely
correct.
it
would've
said
that
duplicate
on
the
one
that
leonard
had
in
any
case,
that
you're
right,
it
would
have
(inaudible)
it.
but
other
than
the
duplicate
words
and
the
photograph,
the
identifying
information
was
identical.
leonard
acting
as
linnie
was
then
arrested
in
october
of
1972
on
a
drug
violation
was
booked
as
linnie
carl
mccollan
was
released
on
bail
as
linnie
carl
mccollan
signed
all
the
papers
that
he
signed
as
linnie
mccollan
and
then
left
to
town
presumably
because
his
bonds
been
later
surrendered
the
bond
in
sought
to
have
a
warrant
issued
for
the
missing
linnie
carl
mccollan.
the
justice
of
the
peace
dutifully
issued
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
linnie
carl
mccollan,
a
copy
of
which
is
in
the
appendix.
one
significant
item
in
this
point,
the
warrant
was
issued
on
november
3,
1972.
this
suit
is
against
petitioner
baker
who
was
sheriff
of
potter
county
but
he
was
not
sheriff
of
potter
county
up
till
this
time.
in
fact,
certain
events
happened
one
in
this
case,
one
being
the
death
of
sheriff
gaither,
his
predecessor.
sheriff
baker
was
then
appointed
on
november
28,
1972,
newly
in
office.
then
the
respondent
becomes
involved
when
on
december
26,
1972,a
dallas
police
officer
stopped
the
respondent
for
traffic
violation
reported
the
name
and
identifying
information
through
their
central
office
and
was
informed
that
there
was
a
potter
county
warrant
outstanding
for
linnie
carl
mccollan.
he
dutifully
arrested
him,
took
him
to
the
station,
a
respondent
protested
that
he
wasn't
the
man
wanted
and
there's
no
evidence
of
whether
this
was
a
unique
statement
but
in
any
case
the
police
officer
did
ask
his
superior
to
contact
potter
county.
they
compared
the
identifying
information
and
as
you
might
expect
said
no,
this
is
the
man,
that's
the
man
we
want
with
a
warrant.
in
december
30th,
potter
county
deputy
with
a
warrant
went
to
dallas,
picked
up
respondent,
returned
him
to
the
potter
county
jail,
evening
of
december
30th.
sheriff
baker
against
doing
this
action
was
brought
--
was
not
present
at
the
jail
at
that
time,
had
left
the
evening
and
was
going
to
be
gone
over
the
new
year's
holidays
and
even
though
he
had
contact
with
his
office
received
no
notice
of
any
protest
by
respondent
that
he
was
not
the
right
man
wanted.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
this
was
earlier
in
1972.
i'm
sorry
i
did
not
recall
the
precise
date
but
i
bet
this
issue
at
sometime
in
1972.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
mr.
mccollan
said
in
the
trial
that
he
didn't
know
how
his
older
brother
came
by
the
information.
it
was
demonstrated
that
the
applicant
for
the
duplicate
license
himself
the
applicant
which
would've
been
leonard
gave
the
specific
identifying
information.
respondent
admitted
that
his
brother
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
he
had
an
erroneous
birth
date
on
his
driver's
license
that
he
had
not
told
him
and
he
didn't
know
how
he
knew
this.
but
in
any
case,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
precisely
how
brother
leonard
obtained
the
information.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
no,
sir,
your
honor,
and
this
is
the
point
that
it's
being
raised
by
respondents
in
this
case.
when
leonard
was
arrested
as
linnie
carl
mccollan,
he
was
fingerprinted
and
photographed.
he
was
arrested
and
both
to
answer
the
police
--
city
police
department
then
transferred
to
potter
county
but
potter
county
also
photographed
and
finger
printed
leonard.
at
the
time
they
did
not
take
and
this
is
one
of
the
points
that
respondent
makes,
they
did
not
take
fingerprints
and
photographs
with
them
to
dallas
when
they
picked
him
up.
they
returned
him
and
apparently
did
not
compare
the
photographs
at
that
time.
immediately,
on
january
2nd,
when
sheriff
baker
arrived
back
to
jail
was
informed
that
a
man
was
contending
that
he
was
not
the
correct
linnie
carl
mccollan.
he
immediately
investigated,
compared
the
photographs
and
they
had
the
arresting
officer
had
kept
the
duplicate
driver's
license
that
had
been
issued
to
leonard
for
some
reason
or
there
was
some
problem
with
it
and
they
brought
respondent
down
from
the
jail.
the
sheriff
discussed
it
where
the
--
asking
whose
picture
was
on
there.
he
said
it
was
his
brother
leonard.
the
sheriff
acted
on
his
own
to
release
him,
arranged
transportation
back
to
dallas.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
this
is
the
assumption
that
it's
made.
we
don't
know
whether
the
photographs
have
been
sent
to
dallas
certainly
someone
would
have
known
sooner
that
the
contention
was
real,
he
possibly
wasn't
the
person.
our
question
personally
whether
--
i
don't
know
whether
police
office
in
general
has
the
authority
to
make
this
determination
but
in
fact
they
were
not
since,
so
there
was
no
comparison
made
until
the
second
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
i
assume
that
is
your
honor.
i
don't
know
if
there's
no
particular
record
in
this
case
about
this.
but
there
was
some
statement
they
could've
been
mailed,
they
could've
been
sent
to
dallas.
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
well,
by
mail
i
don't
know
if
they
do
any
telegraphic
method.
it's
not
in
the
record
and
i
personally
don't
know,
your
honor
whether
they
do
or
not.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
the
place
where
he
was
ultimately
held
and
released,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
no,
sir
and
we're
not
--
we're
certainly
not
contending
there
was.
our
initial
position
in
this
case
is
simply
that
we
have
not
stated
a
violation
of
due
process
where
there
is
arrest
pursuant
to
a
warrant
that
describes
the
individual
in
the
warrant.
that
the
respondent's
position
on
this
would
be
tantamount
to
suggesting
that
due
process
not
only
requires
identification
to
a
warrant
but
that
the
most
efficient
means
of
identification
must
be
used
or
one
cannot
rely
upon
the
warrant
and
it
is
our
position
that
in
this
case,
there's
the
police
officer
has
traditionally
been
held
to
the
stand
that
he
must
have
either
a
valid
warrant
and
there's
no
contention
this
warrant
is
not
valid
or
rely
upon
probable
cause.
here,
the
arrest
was
supported
arrest
and
confinement
by
a
valid
warrant
in
the
name
of
respondent.
that
respondent
as
in
the
case
of
anyone
who
is
arrested
and
later
acquitted
was
determined
not
to
be
the
one
who
should've
been
arrested.
he
was
released
in
due
course
through
the
investigation.
so,
the
threshold
question
we
believe
the
fifth
circuit
overlooked
was
whether
there
was
in
fact
a
violation
of
due
process
because
there
was
in
fact
a
warrant
for
their
arrest.
the
fifth
circuit
reasoned
from
the
reversed
side
of
the
case
by
concluding
that
being
demonstrated
after
the
fact
that
he
should
not
have
been
arrested
therefore
it
was
a
false
imprisonment,
that
false
imprisonment
is
an
intentional
tort
and
under
their
own
case
of
bryan
versus
jones,
it
can
be
read
to
suggest
that
the
only
thing
necessary
for
this
tort
is
that
someone
was
in
fact
confined.
he
was
aware
of
his
confinement
and
suffered
injury
by
it.
however,
even
under
bryan
versus
jones,
there
was
a
preliminary
finding
and
that
is
that
there
was
a
confinement
without
any
process
and
it
may
be
that
under
monroe
versus
pape,
we
can
presume
intent
to
confine
without
process
when
there
is
in
fact
no
process.
but
it
seems
a
little
farfetched
to
presume
intent
to
confine
without
process
when
there
was
in
fact
process
naming
the
person
arrested.
second
difficulty
with
the
fifth
circuit's
initial
approach
to
the
case
is
that
they
concluded
that
sheriff
baker
could
be
held
responsible
for
the
acts
of
his
deputies
and
because
it
was
necessary
in
this
case
to
attribute
the
acts
of
the
deputies
to
sheriff
baker
if
he
was
to
have
liability.
they
did
so
by
simply
suggesting
that
he
is
responsible
for
the
acts
of
his
deputies.
he
authorized
them
to
go
so
then
in
fact,
he
committed
the
confinement.
again,
we
find
it
rather
difficult
to
conclude
that
sheriff
baker
intended
to
confine
the
man
when
his
first
action
upon
learning
that
this
particular
man
was
confined
was
to
investigate
and
release
him.
and
the
only
way
we
can
get
to
sheriff
baker
on
the
confinement
is
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
which
we
believe
this
court
should
as
well
as
in
the
city
cases
in
monell
should
extend
your
conclusion
there
that
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
should
not
apply
to
sheriffs
either.
respondents
would
take
one
further
step
and
say
that
the
sheriff
in
texas
is
responsible
for
the
acts
of
his
deputies.
and
he
is
statutory
responsible
for
supervising
his
deputies
and
can
be
held
as
a
surety
for
them
but
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
use
this
is
a
basis
for
extending
respondeat
superior
to
the
sheriff
because
then
it
would
tend
to
make
1983
a
variable
statute
depending
on
what
state
statutes
happen
to
apply
in
any
given
jurisdiction.
the
fifth
circuit
acknowledged
that
there
might
be
some
question
here
on
respondeat
superior
so
they
then
shifted
their
analysis
to
the
sheriff
and
suggested
that
it
should
be
the
sheriff's
own
acts
or
conduct.
the
sheriff
did
not
act
affirmably
in
any
way
to
confine
or
restrain
respondent.
therefore,
they
suggested
that
it
was
a
failure
to
act,
a
failure
to
have
implemented
a
policy
of
transmitting
photographs
and
fingerprints
which
he
himself
said
after
the
fact
as
a
result
of
this,
he
investigated
and
determined
that
this
would
be
a
good
policy.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
no,
your
honor.
if
he
in
fact
he
directed
him
to
go
arrest
this
particular
person
to
what
he
authorized
them
to
do
to
execute
the
warrant
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
little
farfetched
to
suggest
that
he
intended
that
they
arrest
the
wrong
man
and
that
in
authorizing
a
deputy
to
execute
a
warrant
that
he
has
then
authorized
them
to
misapply
the
process.
i
understand
your
question
and
it's
probably
so
but
we're
dealing
here
with
the
question
of
whether
someone
has
committed
intentional
conduct
and
we
--
it
appears
to
me
that
we
are
taking
a
question
of
whether
intentional
conduct
has
been
committed
and
presuming
that
the
conduct
has
been.
i
understand
fully
the
position
or
i
think
i
do
that
specific
intent
to
violate
the
statute
may
not
be
required
but
it
always
has
seemed
to
it
in
the
past
that
this
court
has
required
at
least
there
be
some
intentional
conduct.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
no,
sir.
the
sheriff
certainly
didn't
suggest
that
in
all
the
evidence
in
this
case
indicates
the
sheriff,
number
one,
was
displeased
with
it.
he
acted
the
only
affirmative
conduct
shown
in
this
case
by
sheriff
has
all
been
in
ultimate
good
faith.
the
moment
he
had
noticed
he
acted
to
release
him.
the
moment
he
investigated,
determined
what
caused
it
he
acted
to
change
the
policy.
we
raised
also
in
our
briefs
the
evidentiary
question
that
this
in
effect
should
not
in
any
circumstance
be
evidence
of
negligence
because
of
the
federal
rule
or
procedure
that
states
that
you
don't
use
corrective
action
to
prove
the
negligence
of
the
initial
action.
but
our
feeling
is
there
is
no
intentional
conduct
directed
toward
depriving
respondent
of
a
federally
protected
right.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
well,
not
any
level
of
negligence.
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
we
are
talking
here
about
simple
negligence
because
there
was
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
yes
sir.
and
under
those
circumstances
we
would
hold
that
1983
does
not
reach
that
conduct
a
simple
inadvertent
failure
to
take
some
precaution
unless,
it
reaches
the
level
where
there
is
a
known
duty
and
the
failure
to
act
could
be
come
within
the
intentional
disregard
or
deliberate
and
different
standards
that
have
been
set
out
in
some
of
the
other
cases.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
yes,
sir.
but
that
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
yes,
sir.
i
think
and
in
that
case
where
you're
relying
on
a
warrant
it
is
probably
you
should
take
reasonable
statute
to
identify
the
man
as
being
the
man
named
in
the
warrant.
but
the
respondent
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
well,
there
is
no
evidence
concerning
the
reasonableness
of
the
steps
taken.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
and
if
there
was
known
duty
to
take
the
steps
then
i
think
we
may
have
that
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
certainly.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
i
think
this
start
is
getting
closer.
i
think
that
should
be
part
of
plaintiff's
burden
to
show
that
there
were
not
reasonable
steps
and
under
those
circumstances
i
think
if
it
reaches
the
level
that
you
could
suggest
deliberate
indifference,
intentional
disregard
for
your
attempts
to
arrest
a
man,
yes,
sir.
if
it
is
a
simple
negligence
failure
to
advert
something
under
without
any
knowledge
of
a
preexisting
problem
there,
it
would
be
my
position
that
that
would
be
an
extension
of
the
1983
beyond
any
holding
of
this
court
in
the
past.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
yes,
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle

well,
i
believe
that
we
first
look
to
the
statute
in
1983
to
determine
since
that
statute
under
which
we
were
recovering
to
try
to
determine
whether
this
requires
intentional
conduct.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
it
says
that
one
who
subjects
or
causes
one
to
be
subjected.
this
leaves
open
the
question,
i
believe,
of
whether
they
were
talking
about
whether
you
need
active
conduct,
it
implies
subjects
or
causes
one
to
be
subjection
my
mind
implies
that
someone
must
have
done
something
and
that
therefore,
i
would
feel
that
it
would
require
some
intent,
some
intentional
act
because
and
been
going
beyond
it
behind
that,
i
think
when
we
look
at
the
congressional
record
of
the
debates,
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
the
drafters
of
this
statute
were
in
any
way
thinking
of
unintentional
conduct.
the
complete
review,
they
were
talking
about
crimes
of
deliberate
failures
to
enforce
the
law,
deliberate
violations
of
person's
rights.
and
so,
i
believe
that
the
statute
itself
must
some
initial
threshold
determination
must
be
made.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
well,
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
no,
the
sheriff's
office
--
the
sheriff
had
nothing
to
do
with
issuing
the
warrant.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
no,
sir.
and
then
the
sheriff's
office
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
in
the
name
linnie
carl
mccollan.
that
was
issued
by
justice
of
the
peace.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
well,
they
--
when
a
warrant
is
issued
apparently
they
--
this
is
communicated.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
well,
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
potter
county
sheriff's
office
went
to
get
it.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
and
certainly
unquestionably
they
intentionally
confined
him.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
but
they
did
not
intentionally
confine
him
without
a
warrant
or
without
process
in
any
fashion.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
if
you
have
a
right
to
freedom,
that's
unfettered
without
any
ability
to
rely
upon
process.
yes,
sir.
it
is
my
belief
though
that
the
police
officer
must
be
able
in
some
fashion
to
rely
upon
process
in
the
name
of
the
person
to
be
arrested
and
in
fact,
they
did.
and
in
fact,
they
were
procedures
used
to
determine
that
he
was
their
own
man
and
he
was
in
fact
released
by
the
same
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
december
30th
in
the
evening
and
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
yes,
sir,
and
they
did
not
--
the
officers
that
were
there
did
not
compare
it.
for
sheriff
baker
as
to
say
was
not
there
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
it
was
in
the
sheriff's
office
unquestionably,
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
yes,
sir
and
unfortunately
this
was
the
case
in
this
office
at
that
time
and
it
is
certainly
that
should
not
necessarily
be
a
reason
but
the
evidence
indicated
that
the
normal
of
the
people
weren't
there
and
it
takes
certain
people
to
compare
fingerprints
and
photographs
and
there
were
--
the
sheriff
was
not
notified
of
the
man's
contentions
and
because
immediately
upon
being
so
notified,
they
didn't
act
to
release
him.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
your
honor,
if
i
might
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
respondent's
position
boils
down
to
this
that
the
due
process
clause
now
has
a
new
recognized
federal
right
and
that
being
that
if
a
man
who's
been
previously
arrested,
no
warrant
for
that
man
may
be
issued
or
exercise
without
using
finger
prints
and
photographs
to
identify
the
subsequent
man.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
(voice
overlap)
but
he
suggest
that
as
a
matter
of
due
process
that
reasonableness
of
identity
must
include
using
fingerprints
and
photographs
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
well,
your
honor
may
i
submit
that
due
process
then
should
not
require
that
at
any
stage
in
this
proceedings
during
this
period
of
time
simply
because
if
plaintiff
respondent
in
this
case
is
going
to
demonstrate
a
--
an
unreasonable
method
of
identification
then
he
should've
approach
it
by
showing
that
the
method
used
was
unreasonable.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
corrective
action
instituted
by
the
sheriff
should
have
been
used.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that
was
suggested
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
absolutely,
and
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
sheriff
in
this
case
should
not
have
been
held
liable
under
state
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
yes
sir,
and
he
did
--
he
had
telephone
contact
one
of
his
deputies
obviously
failed
to
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
--
advise
him.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
certainly
but
he
had
no
notice
that
this
man
was
arrested
and
we're
talking
here
of
according
to
respondent
about
an
intentional
tort
that
he
intended
to
arrest
to
this
man
and
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
no
sir.
i'm
--
the
only
point
i
was
making
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
well,
the
point
is
that
some
place
in
here,
this
is
a
personal
action
against
sheriff
baker.
somewhere
in
here
there
should
be
a
showing
that
the
sheriff
made
that
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
acted
erroneously
yes,
sir.
but
i
--
it
is
my
position
that
the
procedures
examined
should
be
the
procedures
used
and
not
the
procedures
not
used
if
we're
going
to
treat
it
as
a
tort.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
the
evidence
also
shows
that
on
coming
back
they
would've
also
routinely
process
his
--
the
new
photographs
and
id
made
at
the
time
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
well,
i
think
the
only
testimony
was
that
the
id
man
was
not
on
duty
during
that
period
himself.
it
was
a
matter
that
they
were
apparently
shorthanded
and
didn't
have
a
man
on
duty
during
that
weekend.
and
i
believe
that's
the
answer
in
those.
our
position
is
that
there
were
procedures.
they
in
fact
worked
in
this
case,
the
problem
being
that
there
was
a
short
delay.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
the
court
of
appeals,
yes
sir,
they
finally
determined
that
it
should
go
back
to
determine
whether
the
sheriff
was
unreasonable
in
failing
to
have
previously
instituted
this
policy.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
that
would
be
a
question
fact
and
it
was
our
position
of
course
that
this
is
a
pure
negligence
issue
and
that
if
this
court
affirms
that
holding
that
it
would
be
extending
1983
to
simple
negligence
act.
mr.
a.
w.
sorelle
iii
yes,
sir.
so
that
in
any
allegation
if
a
man
was
arrested
confined
later
determined
that
he
should
not
have
been
confined
whether
accorded
by
a
jury
or
not
presumably
he
would
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
jailer
to
determine
whether
the
jailer
should've
had
investigated
and
determined
earlier
that
he
was
the
wrong
man.
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
in
this
case
had
sheriff
baker
or
he
would
have
been
better-off
had
he
done
nothing
taken
this
respondent
before
the
magistrate
having
bound
over
for
trial
and
ignored
the
--
any
change
have
been
--
his
procedure
then
it
would
have
been
left
up
to
the
jury
to
determine
his
innocence
because
sheriff
baker
acted
affirmatively
to
determine
that
this
was
the
wrong
man
in
releasing
and
then
acted
affirmatively
to
investigate
and
determine
the
better
procedure
by
his
own
good
faith
acts
created
the
sole
evidence
on
which
they
fifth
circuit
determine
to
submit
a
cause
to
the
jury.
the
trial
court
considered
that
there
was
no
violation
of
due
process
and
direct
the
verdict.
the
fifth
circuit
i
believe
erroneously
placed
it
in
contact
with
royal
versus
kautzky.
thank
you.
