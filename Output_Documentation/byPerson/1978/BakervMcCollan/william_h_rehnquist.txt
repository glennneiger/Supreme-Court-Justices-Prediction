justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
talk
about
respondeat
superior,
mr.
sorelle,
aren't
you
ordinarily
talking
about
the
liability
of
the
supervisor
for
the
negligence
of
his
employees
and
here
as
i
understand
it
the
deputies
were
simply
carrying
out
the
instructions
of
the
sheriff,
that
wouldn't
be
respondeat
superior
to
say
that
the
sheriff
is
liable
if
he
directs
one
of
his
deputies
to
go
and
arrest
somebody,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
texas,
is
it
true
as
in
most
place
i've
observed
that
public
offices
aren't
really
beehives
of
activity
over
new
year's
weekend?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
(inaudible)
of
potter
county?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
tort
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
larson,
are
you
saying
that
every
case
of
false
imprisonment
or
false
arrest
a
common
law
tort
is
necessarily
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
line?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
a
false
arrest
or
false
imprisonment
by
a
state
or
a
person
acting
under
colorado
state
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
ask
you.
i
mean,
either
--
is
every
single
official
or
false
arrest
or
false
imprisonment
a
violation
of
the
person's
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
warden
about
prison
having
5,000
inmates
takes
a
stroll
through
the
athletic
field
and
a
prisoner
yells
at
me,
i'm
wrongfully
confined,
i
don't
belong
here.
and
does
the
warden
have
a
duty
thereupon
to
immediately
suspend
whatever
else
they
plan
to
do
for
the
day
and
go
back
and
check
the
records
on
that
particular
man?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
same
day
he
would
have
to
check?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
so
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(voice
overlap)
the
losing
argue.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
an
issue
here
mr.
larson?
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
could
be
submitted
to
the
jury
upon
retrial
afterwards
and
you,
you
haven't
cross-petitioned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
sexy,
is
it
maybe
is
it
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
not
obliged
to
follow
if
he's
in
error?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
simply
said
the
case
have
to
go
back
for
a
jury
verdict,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
and
that
was
to
be
determined
by
the
jury
or
judge
as
my
question
of
fact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
under
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
the
procedures
used
by
the
sheriff
would
be
a
question
of
facts
for
the
jury
in
every
case
as
to
whether
they
confer
to
the
constitution?
