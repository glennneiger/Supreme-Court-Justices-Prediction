the
case
is

we'll

arguments

in
752,
baker
against
mccollan.
mr.
sorelle,
i
think
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
whose
date
of
birth
was
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
with
this
duplicate
driver's
license,
at
what
stage
did
that
get
into
the
hands
of
the
person
to
whom
it
was
not
lawfully
issued?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
and
by
what?
did
the
respondent
linnie
carl
mccollan
give
it
to
his
brother?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
this
particular
sheriff's
office
have
the
facilities
for
transmitting
fingerprints
by
mail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
larson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
clear
on
the
facts
here
yet
either
from
the
reading
of
the
appendix
and
records
or
the
argument,
how
did
this
unauthorized
license
get
in
the
hands
of
driver's
license
get
in
the
hands
of
unauthorized
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
fact,
may
be
so
in
fact
but
you
have
difficult
time
persuading
me
that
that's
true
on
the
basis
of
this
appendix.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
it's
clearly
different
that
these
two
are
so
clearly
different.
one
has
glasses,
the
other
doesn't
but
sometimes
all
of
us
do
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you've
described
this
in
your
brief
and
i'm
still
not
clear
on
the
relevance
of
it
but
you
described
it
as
a
forged
fictitious
driver's
license
since
you've
gone
to
that
trouble
to
describe
it
that
way.
what's
the
significance
of
that
fact
to
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
what
point
after
the
arrest
to
this
become
unlawful?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
never
mind
what
the
sheriff
said.
in
your
case
here
when
did
the
arrest
which
you
have
just
conceded
was
made
on
probable
cause
under
a
warrant
when
after
that
arrest
did
the
custody
become
unlawful?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
he
had
--
he
signs
a
statement
admitting
that
he
is
the
man
described
on
the
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
any
time
did
he
indicate
that
there
might
be
some
problem
about
his
brother
having
created
this
identification
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sorelle.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
