justice

and

justice

and

misspelled
as
leonard
or

justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
aren't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
brother
leonard?
justice
potter
stewart
in
every
time
a
person
is
in
a
jail
or
prison?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
well,
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
were
stating
the
general
proposition
that
the
burden
is
on
the
custodian
always
as
a
general
role
to
show
the
validity
of
the
custody.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
presumptions
against
the
custody
of
the
people
in
this
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
assume
that
most
people
in
the
prisons
of
our
country
are
there
because
of
not
everybody
is
there
because
they've
been
convicted
in
criminal
courts
on
criminal
charges
and
sentence
to
prison
and
yet
you
say
the
presumption
is
against
the
validity
of
their
imprisonment?
justice
potter
stewart
to
justify
the
imprisonment
always?
the
burden
is
on
him?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
the
applicant
of
the
plaintiff
had
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
potter
stewart
because
you
he
doesn't
you
say.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
larson,
is
it
now
your
claim
or
was
it
in
your
complaint
that
this
arrest
was
not
made
on
probable
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
arrest
was
what
led
to
the
custody
and
it
was
the
arrest
made
on
probable
cause
or
not
in
your
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
think
my
answer
--
my
question
could
be
answered
yes
or
no
and
then
so
what
you
wish
but
i
--
is
it
part
of
your
case
that
the
arrest
was
not
made
on
probable
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
concede
that
it
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
made
on
probable
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
all
we
know
in
this
talk
is
there
being
two
people,
both
named
linnie
mccollan
one
guilty
of
an
offense
and
the
other
not
all
that
talk
is
really
--
there's
nothing
to
do
with
probable
cause,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
saying
this
was
an
invalid
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
nor
that
the
--
therefore
that
the
ensuing
custody
at
least
for
a
short
time
was
not
valid?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
because
that
way
he's
made
sure
he's
the
man.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
that
mr.
larson
to
be
saying
that.
i
thought
he
conceded
the
validity
of
the
arrest.
justice
potter
stewart
not
for
the
original
arrest
as
i
understood
mr.
larson.
