justice
thurgood
marshall
did
(inaudible)
save
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
another
point,
was
he
fingerprinted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
agree
with
the
other
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
they
sent
that
to
dallas,
that's
all
that
have
been
avoided.
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
the
police
officer
sent
fingerprints
over
the
wire?
isn't
that
a
common
procedure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
particular
place
had
the
fingerprints
of
both
of
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
couldn't
they
have
get
into
the
officers
when
they
went
to
dallas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
were
none
to
stop
them
from
doing
that
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
point
i'm
worrying
about.
if
the
sheriff
said,
it's
my
policy,
don't
check
behind
these
warrants,
go
pick
up
whoever
he
is.
but
that's
not
this
case
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
true
that
the
“sheriff's
office”
was
the
cause
of
this
man
being
arrested,
the
cause
of
him
being
transported
back
to
potter
and
it
cause
from
being
held
until
the
sheriff
appear
in
the
middle?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
“sheriff's
office”.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
the
“sheriff's
office”.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
told
to
dallas
to
hold
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
told
to
dallas
to
hold
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
next,
who
went
to
get
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
are
the
ones
that
did
deny
him
his
right
to
freedom.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don't
you
have
to
have
in
the
record?
don't
you
have
to
have
in
the
record
the
fact
that
the
sheriff
had
this
before
he
arrested
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
wasn't
sheriff
baker,
it
was
his
predecessor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
sheriff
baker
did
not
respond
before
his
predecessor
did,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--arrest
my
chief
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
don't
understand
is
that
you
filed
habeas
corpus
and
you
say,
i
am
not
the
right
man
and
warden
files
a
capias
and
said,
well,
here
is
the
instructions
i
got
to
put
this
man
in
jail.
i
say
to
that
if
you
don't
do
something
else
you
stay
in
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
there
is
some
burden
on
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all
because
the
particular
time
to
say
(voice
overlap).
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
would
he
show
that.
he
showed
that
in
the
lawsuit,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
didn't
show
that
while
he
was
being
held,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
he
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
all
he
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
doesn't
admit
it?
very
seldom
that
when
you
pick
up
a
guy,
he
said,
yes,
i'm
the
name
you're
looking
for.
isn't
that
very
seldom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
that
stage
he
didn't
know
it
was
his
brother
that
they
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
do
you
do
with
the
bench
warrant
that's
authorized
either
pick
up
john
c.
doe
immediately?
the
command,
i
think
is
the
word.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
discretion
did
the
sheriff
have
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
john
doe
who
lives
at
2268
appleway
drive,
amarillo,
texas.
justice
thurgood
marshall
zip
code
17822.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
he
get
the
same
trouble
he
has
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
couldn't
they
issue
bench
warrant
in
this
case
and
then
jump
in?
are
you
certain
he
can
issue
a
bench
warrant
when
a
man
jumped
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
most
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
all
the
man
says,
i'm
not
the
man
then
he
has
to
go
to
work.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
make
sure
that
he
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
sorelle,
isn't
one
of
the
complaints
that
the
sheriff
have
been
out
celebrating
new
year's
eve,
he
may
have
been
turn
loose
right
away?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
and
the
record
show
that
as
soon
as
the
sheriff
was
made
aware
of
the
facts
he
turned
the
man
loose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could've
come
in
during
the
holiday
and
take
a
look
at
his
job.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
say
to
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
the
more
contact
you
get
in
with
the
jail
the
more
trouble
you
get
in.
