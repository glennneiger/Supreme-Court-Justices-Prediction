justice
thurgood
marshall
he
wasn't
in
the
juvenile
court
when
he
made
this
question
in
his
answers,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
one
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
with
the
police?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
was
it
the
same
police
that
arrested
other
suspects?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
what's
the
difference
about
miranda
applying?
it's
the
same
officer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
justice
thurgood
marshall
including
a
statement
--
confession
out
of
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
why
certainly
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
different,
the
juvenile
would
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fifth
amendment
does
apply
to
juveniles,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
state
matter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
state
matter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
i
mean
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
question
as
to
what
type
of
procedure
is
used
for
a
juvenile
is,
first
of
all,
a
state
matter,
and
this
is
--
the
state
supreme
court
passed
on
that,
doesn't
it
preclude
us
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
in
that
one
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
that
one
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
is
a
case
in
california
where
a
lawyer
told
the
guy,
under
miranda
ruling,
“don't
talk?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
he
told
him,
“go
ahead
and
talk,”
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
tell
him
not
to
talk,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
what
happens
to
all
that
i
--
was
been
made
to
read
and
don't
let
them
talk
to
the
lawyers,
but
the
lawyer
automatically
tell
him
to
shut
up?
what
happens
to
all
of
that
theory
we
argued
here
every
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
guess
it's
gone,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when,
he
said
one
case
that
says
so
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
perhaps
he
really
trusted
the
probation
officer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
might
have
wanted
to
--
the
police
--
the
probation
officer
to
tell
him
whether
he
was
a
counsel.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
whether
this
guy
was
a
phony.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
in
order
he
says,
“can
i
have
my
probation
officer
here?”
“well,
i
can't
get
a
hold
of
your
probation
officer
right
now.
you
have
the
right
to
have
an
attorney.”
and
then,
he
said,
“how
will
i
know
you
guys
won't
pull
no
police
officer
in
and
tell
me
he's
an
attorney?”
he
tells
you
why
he
wants
a
probation
officer
there,
to
make
sure
you
don't
pull
a
phony
on
him.
he
said
so
right
here,
doesn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
he
say
right
in
the
next
sentence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
he
was
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
“we
will
get
you
your
probation
officer."
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
he
say
that,
they
would
get
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
“well,
i'm
not
going
to
call
mr.
christiansen
tonight.
there's
a
good
chance
we
could
talk
to
him
later.”
so,
they
gave
him
a
good
little
idea
that
the
events
that
they
would
--
they
dangled
it
in
front
of
him,
didn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
to
show
over
and
over
again,
which
constantly
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
doing
what
miranda
said,
“don't
do.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
question,
“will
you
talk
to
us
without
an
attorney
present?”
that's
--
there's
nothing
ambiguous
about
that,
is
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right,
because
they
had
led
him
up
to
it.
they
told
him
they'll
get
his
probation
officer
later
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
after
they
told
him
they
would
get
the
probation
officer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
after.
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
was
he
to
ask
for
a
prosecutor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference
between
a
prosecutor
and
a
probation
officer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they're
both
paid
by
the
same
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what?
where
do
you
get
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
do
you
get
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
one
point
that
i'm
interested
in
right
now
is
why
is
a
probation
officer
singled
out
as
the
only
person?
suppose
the
guy
had
said,
“i'd
like
to
talk
to
the
magistrate”
or
“i'd
like
to
talk
to
a
judge”
or
“i'd
like
to
talk
to
a
professor
of
law.”
why
the
probation
officer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
some
professors
of
law
that
are
members
of
the
bar
of
this
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
only
judge
mosk's
opinion,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
give
me
your
idea
of
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
takes
the
place
of
the
parents?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
--
this
case
wouldn't
be
present
in
any
place
than
california?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
look,
do
you
agree
with
that
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
it
in
this
case
it
said
--
all
such
papers
in
this
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
there
such
papers
in
this
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
has
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
this
--
in
california
he'd
be
all
that
but
we
have
great
difficulty
--
i
have
great
difficulty
in
assuming
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
was
this
--
when
was
this
done
in
his
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
(voice
overlap)
what
am
i
suppose
to
understand?
you
don't
even
know
when.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
know
where,
when,
where
or
why.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
do
with,
“okay,
will
you
talk
to
us
without
an
attorney?”
answer,
“yes.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
at
the
end,
he
says,
“yes.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
state
could've
done
one
of
two
things
till
they
give
him
a
probation
officer
or
a
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
did
he
had
to
get
a
probation
officer
or
nothing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
been
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
lawyer
wouldn't
have
been
satisfactory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
miranda
now?
miranda
said
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
you're
going
to
substitute
probation
officer
for
the
lawyer
and
rewrite
miranda.
justice
thurgood
marshall
please
don't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
menaster,
suppose
the
--
a
very
simple
case,
hypothetical
and
i
hope,
suppose
the
probation
officer
dropped
dead.
he
couldn't
question
him,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
couldn't
question
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
in
the
world
can
you
get
support
for
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you
can't
--
nothing
he
says
can
be
used
against
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
forever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
no,
the
probation
officer
is
still
dead.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
i
mean,
he
could
go
out
there
and
commit
three
more
crimes.
he
could
be
convicted
of
anything
in
your
book.
justice
thurgood
marshall
until
the
probation
officer
was
reincarnated.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
saying
the
probation
officer
(inaudible)
the
moment
he's
dead.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
two
different
animals.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
california's
--
well,
is
the
probation
officer
member
of
the
bar?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there's
a
difference
between
members
of
the
bar
and
lawyers.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
recognize
that
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.
is
he
a
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
has
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
interested
in
any
question
from
you.
when
you
answer
my
question,
please
answer
it
and
don't
ask
me
another
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
i
don't
get
paid
to
answer
your
question.
