mr.
albert
j.
menaster
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
albert
menaster,
public
defender's
office,
county
of
los
angeles,
for
the
minor,
michael
c.,
respondent
in
this
court.
i'd
like
to
start
out
by
telling
this
court
about
another
youngster,
this
one
named
joseph.
joseph
said,
“i
want
to
be
an
adult.
treat
me
like
an
adult.
use
the
miranda
rules
that
apply
to
adults.
use
every
rule
that
applies
to
adults,
please.
in
every
way
i
want
to
be
an
adult.
i
don't
want
to
be
protected.
i
don't
want
things
done
on
my
behalf.
i
want
to
be
treated
just
like
an
adult.”
and
joseph
prosecuted
his
case
through
every
layer
of
court
and
one
day
reached
this
court
and
this
court
decided
joseph's
case
by
saying,
“you
don't
get
to
be
an
adult,
joseph.
you
don't
get
your
jury
trial.”
and
the
case
was
mckeiver
versus
pennsylvania.
this
court
said
in
mckeiver
that
there
was
something
different
about
juveniles,
something
that
is
not
the
same
as
to
an
adult.
and
that
difference
justified
denying
joseph
a
right
every
adult
in
this
country
has
and
that's
the
right
to
a
jury.
michael
comes
to
this
court
any
--
and
on
his
behalf
i
read
briefs
by
the
petitioner
and
i
have
trouble
with
those
briefs.
i
can't
find
the
word
“minor”
in
those
briefs.
i
keep
hearing
about
defendants
and
suspects
and
what
the
rules
ought
to
be,
and
it's
all
very
interesting
and
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
the
difference
is
that,
beyond
not
using
the
term,
petitioner
never
focuses
on
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
the
problem
is
that
petitioner
fails
to
argue
the
application
of
the
miranda
rules
to
juveniles.
they
go
off
on
their
theories
of
ambiguity
and
their
theories
of
totality
of
circumstances
always
focusing
on
the
suspect,
never
addressing
the
reality
that
a
juvenile
is
involved
in
this
case.
now,
the
importance
--
i'm
glad
the
court
asked
the
question,
the
importance
is
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
recognized
that
when
a
juvenile
is
involved,
a
16-year-old
as
in
this
case,
a
14-year-old,
a
10-year-old,
is
a
10-year-old
going
to
hire
an
attorney,
“oh,
call
up
mr.
bailey,
i'd
like
to
have
him
as
my
attorney
now.”
that's
not
realistic.
that
does
not
take
into
account
the
reality
of
minority.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
i
guess
it
depends
on
whether
it's
a
live
teddy
bear,
but
i
think
that
the
answer
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
okay.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
the
answer
is
that
a
request
for
a
teddy
bear
would
be
one
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
that
--
where
the
court
should
take
into
account
in
ascertaining
whether
or
not
that
youngster
was
really
voluntarily
waiving
his
rights
or
not.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
not
for
the
teddy
bear
request.
that
would
be
one
of
the
totality
factors.
as
to
request
for
a
probation
officer,
that's
quite
different.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
that's
correct,
and
that
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
that's
right.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
and
the
reason
for
that
decision,
the
california
supreme
court
is
very
careful
to
note
and
distinguish.
they
distinguished
music
teachers,
clergymen
and
if
they
thought
of
it
they
would've
distinguished
teddy
bears,
i
guarantee
you.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
yes.
i
think
that
the
line
the
supreme
court
is
drawing
is
a
very
clear
line.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
older
brothers
and
sisters.
parents,
however,
would
be
different
because
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
versus
burton
held
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
if
he
got
this
prosecutor,
he'd
be
in
trouble,
but
i
think
that
if
he'd
ask
for
a
prosecutor,
he
would
not
be
invoking
what
miranda
talks
about
and
affirm
the
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
a
big
difference,
the
world
of
difference,
and
i'd
like
to
take
issue
with
the
statement
at
hand
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
it's
not
true.
it
is
not
true.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
yes,
we
all
are
paid
by
the
same
people.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
i
suppose
everybody
here
is
paid
by
the
same
people.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
that
is
the
people.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
professor
of
law
would
be
an
attorney.
if
he
wants
an
attorney,
that's
miranda.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
there
is
something
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
the
california
supreme
court
answered
that
question
by
very
carefully
delineating
what
it
was
about
the
probation
officer
that
made
a
request
for
that
person
a
natural
miranda
invocation.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
no,
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
majority
opinion
at
pages
476
and
477.
the
court
recited
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
i'd
be
glad
to
and
it
can
happen
--
the
match
up
with
the
california
supreme
court's
idea.
the
probation
officer
in
california
plays
a
unique
role.
probation
officer
has
a
statutory
duty
on
behalf
of
the
minor
“to
act
in
the
interests
of
the
minor.”
it's
clearly
a
parens
patriae
attempt
on
the
part
of
california
to
take
away
from
parents
who
failed
and
give
control
to
a
probation
officer
who
becomes
a
substitute
parent
in
every
sense
of
the
parens
patriae
concept.
and,
it's
that
fact
that
distinct
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
yes,
it's
that
distinctive
feature
of
the
probation
officer
in
california
in
this
case
that
made
the
california
supreme
court
draw
that
line.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
i
agree
with
that.
i
--
in
fact
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
--
it's
only
(voice
overlap)
three
years
ago
in
california
of
the
statutes
there.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
it
cannot
be
more
than
precedent
in
california.
in
fact,
it's
only
dicta
as
to
california.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
because
the
statute
as
to
the
role
of
the
probation
office
has
changed
since
this
case.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
record
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
i
think
there
were
parents.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
yes.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
when
the
court
--
the
juvenile
court
takes
control
over
a
minor
in
california
and
i
can't
speak
for
the
rest
of
the
country.
the
juvenile
court
makes
a
specific
finding
and
the
court
can
find
those
findings
in
welfare
institutions
code
sections
in
california
726
through
731
removing
the
care,
custody,
and
control
of
the
minor
from
the
parent
and
placing
it
in
the
probation
officer.
and
the
court
tells
the
minor
“the
probation
officer
is
now
going
to
be
in
charge
of
you.”
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
sometimes,
that
means
--
sometimes
that
removal
from
the
home.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
sometimes
it
doesn't.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
but
that
probation
officer
is
in
charge.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
it
is
clear
that
the
minor
was
on
probation.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
your
honor
it
is
clear
that
the
minor
was
on
probation
and
726
through
731
of
the
code
requires
that
you
can't
be
put
on
probation
unless
that
finding
were
made.
so
that
has
to
be
true
in
this
case.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
it
has
to
be
true.
the
findings
had
to
be
made
for
the
minor
to
be
placed
on
probation
in
this
case.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
again
it
--
the
code
sections
that
i've
referred
to
clearly
delineate
the
required
findings
that
a
court
must
make
in
order
to
place
a
minor
on
probation.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
i
don't
think
the
record
is
clear
as
to
that.
all
we
know
is
that
he
wasn't
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
your
honor,
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
your
honor,
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
yes,
it
is.
however
the
minor
was
on
probation.
that
is
uncontested
in
this
case
and
he
can't
be
in
probation
unless
one
of
those
findings
was
made.
he
had
to
be
removed
from
the
care,
custody
and
control
of
his
parent
and
the
probation
officer
had
to
be
a
substitute
parent
or
he
couldn't
be
on
probation.
that
is
required
in
the
state
of
california
and
reading
of
the
code
sections
that
i've
mentioned
will
clarify
that.
i'd
like
to
indicate
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
managed
in
his
summary
of
facts
to
leave
out
what
i
think
is
a
critical
fact.
it's
interesting
because
it's
not
left
out
in
the
briefs.
it
was
left
out
in
oral
argument
and
that
is
this
probation
officer
was
not
some
artificial
probation
officer
that
the
minor
simply
inquired
of
because
he
couldn't
think
of
anything
else
to
do.
this
probation
officer
had
told
michael.
“when
you
get
arrested,
you
call
me
up.
you
demand
that
you
be
allowed
to
call
me.”
and
he
was
asked,
oddly
by
the
district
attorney,
he
was
asked
why
he
said
that,
what
reasons
were
they.
and
the
answer
was,
“so
i
could
advice
michael
of
his
rights
and
make
sure
he
understood
his
rights.”
the
request
for
the
probation
officer
in
this
case
wasn't
an
academic
request.
he
was
complying
with
an
order
of
his
probation
officer.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
the
record
does
show
an
advisement
by
police
officers
in
california
of
a
number
of
michael's
rights.
i
think
that
it's
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
there's
no
question
that
a
complete
miranda
advisement
was
given
in
this
case,
i'm
not
arguing
that.
but
of
course,
an
advisement
from
the
police
doesn't
mean
an
understanding
on
the
part
of
the
recipient
of
that
advice.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
if
there's
no
question
that
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
it
must
be
a
knowing,
intelligent,
and
voluntary
waiver
of
the
suspect,
not
of
the
police.
the
police
understand
the
rights
perfectly
well.
it's
the
waiver
that
has
to
be
voluntary
and
knowing
and
intelligent.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
no,
it's
not
redirect.
it
would
--
the
facts
of
this
case
clearly
showed
that
michael
was
given
an
advisement
of
his
rights
and
in
response
to
that
he
did
not
say,
“yes,
i'd
like
to
give
up
my
rights.”
he
said
--
he
asked
some
questions
about
it.
he
showed
his
fear.
he
showed
that
he
wasn't
sure
what
he
was
getting
into.
i
think
the
record
is
clear
on
that
point
and
therefore,
in
this
case
what
michael
was
doing
was
asking
for
help
to
get
a
further
understanding
of
what
he
was
getting
into
so
he
wouldn't
get
tricked
which
is
exactly
what
he
said
to
the
police.
and
a
page
later
they
say,
“well,
we
don't
always
play
fair,
do
we?”
certainly,
not
something
that's
not
going
to
make
michael
feel
confident.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
eventually
--
well,
michael
says
a
lot
of
things
in
this
record.
at
one
point,
he
says,
“yes,
i
want
to
talk
to
you.”
he
also
says,
“i
want
my
probation
officer.”
he
also
says,
“i
don't
know
if
--
how
do
i
know
you
won't
bring
in
a
police
officer
and
tell
me
he's
an
attorney?”
he
eventually
--
he
first
--
initially,
when
he
was
first
asked
to
wait
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
i
don't
think
that's
the
end.
after
he
says,
“yes,”
there
are
three
--
situations
--
there
are
three
occasions
after
that
before
he
makes
an
admission
where
he
says,
“no”
in
response
to
the
question,
“do
you
want
to
talk
to
us?”
he
finally
only
talks
after
being
threatened
and
promised
and
crying
and
breaking
down
in
this
case.
i
suggest
that
there
are
no
fewer
than
eight
indications
of
michael's
intention
in
this
record.
one
of
which
is
an
equivocal
waiver,
but
the
other
seven
aren't
and
in
fact,
several
of
those
are
unequivocal
assertions
in
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
the
police
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
i
think
that
they
could've
given
him
a
lawyer.
however,
i
think
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
--
we'd
--
might
be
mistaken.
he
wouldn't
have
trusted
that
lawyer
very
much.
i
don't
think
that
would've
complied
with
the
spirit
of
miranda.
i
think
they
had
to
bring
his
probation
officer.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
if
the
lawyer
talked
with
the
minor,
and
the
minor
then
is
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
yes.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
no,
i
don't
want
to
rewrite
miranda.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
i
vote
not
to
rewrite
miranda.
however,
miranda
has
never
been
applied
to
a
juvenile,
and
that's
the
point
i
made
at
the
outset.
if
we're
going
to
say
that
only
if
a
juvenile
uses
certain
words,
“attorney,”
a
word
that
adults
would
use,
does
the
fifth
amendment
become
invoked?
then
we
are
ignoring
the
reality
that
michael
wasn't
an
adult.
he
was
a
juvenile.
juveniles
aren't
expected,
i
don't
expect
juveniles,
to
ask
for
attorneys
and
let
alone
understand
their
rights
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
assert
them.
and
therefore,
this
court
has
to
decide
one
of
two
things.
either,
we
ignore
the
fact
that
michael
is
a
juvenile
and
require
him
to
comply
with
adult
standards.
in
which
case
i
guess
you
got
to
give
us
a
jury
because
that's
only
fair.
either
michael
is
an
adult
or
he's
not.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
that's
right.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
that's
right.
fair
is
fair.
either
we
get
the
rights
or
we
don't.
either
miranda
applies
differently
to
juveniles
or
it
doesn't.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
yes.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
yes,
but
the
reality
--
it's
not
a
question
of
the
minor
understanding
that
he
has
a
right
to
an
attorney.
it
--
some
10-year-old
is
going
to
get
on
the
phone
and
call
up
an
attorney
and
say,
“i
hereby
hire
you.”
that's
just
not
realistic.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
who's
going
to
get
the
attorney?
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
he
was
a
16-year-old
who's
on
probation
and
afraid
the
police
were
going
to
trick
him
and
they
sure
did,
didn't
they?
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
they
told
him
he
was
going
to
be
better
off.
he's
sitting
in
custody
in
california
right
now
and
he
doesn't
think
he
got
the
best
into
that
deal.
first,
who
fired
the
gun
is
still
on
the
streets,
but
that's
another
point.
the
point
is
that
the
fact
of
the
matter
of
advising
the
minor
as
an
attorney
doesn't
satisfy
the
requirement.
the
youngster
doesn't
know
how
to
get
an
attorney.
we
don't
expect
16-year-olds,
10-year-olds
to
know
attorneys
off
the
top
of
their
heads,
let
alone
even
to
know
about
public
defender
systems.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
we
draw
a
line
somewhere,
i
admit.
and,
i
think
that
the
rules
of
the
system
in
california
drawing
a
line
at
18
between
juveniles
and
adult
is
a
recognition
that
with
majority
comes
maturity
and
certain
requirements
are
--
we
assume
are
going
to
be
applicable
to
a
person
who's
an
adult.
to
a
person
who's
a
juvenile,
it
is
unrealistic.
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
in
burton,
it
is
unrealistic
to
expect
that
a
youngster
is
going
to
ask
for
an
attorney
and
be
able
to
get
one.
he's
going
to
get
his
parents
to
get
him
an
attorney
or
as
in
this
case
a
probation
officer
to
with
was
suggested
earlier,
ensure
that
the
attorney
that's
brought
in
is
a
bona
fide
attorney
and
not
a
sham.
i
think
that's
quite
clear
from
this
record.
i
would
like
to
stress
one
further
point
and
that
is,
we
have
heard
over
and
over
again
about
how
this
probation
officer
was
a
peace
officer.
the
california
supreme
court
expressly
relied
on
the
california
statute,
welfare
and
institutions
code
section
280,
which
says
that
the
minor
--
that
the
probation
officer
is
required
to
act
in
the
interests
of
the
minor.
that's
statutory
duty,
that
is
mandated
by
a
california
code
section,
was
construed
by
the
court
in
california
as
the
reason
why
a
request
for
a
probation
officer
in
this
case
invoked
miranda.
and
i
want
to
disagree
with
something
else
the
petitioner
has
said.
petitioner
said,
“any
request
by
a
minor
for
any
probation
officer
invokes
miranda
per
se,
according
to
the
california
supreme
court.
that
is
not
true.”
it
is
clear
from
the
california
supreme
court's
language.
they
were
saying,
“michael's
request
in
california
for
a
probation
officer
in
this
case,
remember
the
background,
the
probation
officer
advising
the
minor
to
call
him
so
he
could
advice
him
of
his
rights
and
help
him
understand
the
rights,
obviously
help
him
ensure
the
trustworthiness
to
make
sure
that
an
attorney
was
reliable
and
not
a
sham
artist,
that
was
what
the
california
supreme
court
relied
on.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
let
me
point
out
that
this
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
that
issue
but
i
would
like
to
answer
it.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
i'd
be
glad
to
answer
it.
i
think
that
a
statement
under
those
circumstances
would
not
be
admissible
because
the
minor
asking
for
the
probation
officer,
asking
for
that
person
prescribed
by
the
court
to
act
on
his
behalf.
he
thinks
he's
getting
somebody
acting
on
his
behalf.
if
the
probation
officer
comes
in
and
plays
the
role
of
prosecutor,
becomes
an
agent
of
the
prosecution
just
like
the
sham
attorney.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
no.
no
and
i
think
the
difference
is
that
the
attorney
has
a
duty
on
behalf
of
the
youngster.
if
a
probation
officer
fulfills
that
duty
on
behalf
of
the
youngster
and
the
result
is
the
minor
should
make
a
statement,
that's
one
thing.
but
if
he
acts
as
a
prosecutor
and
enhances
the
ability
of
the
prosecution
to
get
a
statement
from
the
minor
when
the
minor
doesn't
really
want
to
make
a
statement
then
he's
contradicting
that
role.
then
he's
been
duped.
then
he
has
the
equivalent
of
a
sham
attorney
that
michael
was
so
worried
about.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
oh,
i
don't
agree.
the
first
word
in
that
sentence
is
the
crucial
word
and
it's
the
word
“here.”
the
california
supreme
court
discussed
the
dynamic
of
this
relationship,
the
extraordinary
unique
facts
involving
this
case
in
fashioned
rule
that
i
submit
is
a
very
narrow
rule.
now,
i
would
be
glad
to
have
this
court
of
the
california
supreme
court
fashion
it
really
broadly,
but
all
that
the
california
supreme
court
did
in
its
writ
--
read
the
opinion
over
and
over
again.
they
say,
“michael's
request
in
this
case
was
for
his
probation
officer
invoked
his
right.”
they
repeatedly
used
that
phrase.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
the
critical
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
the
critical
question
is
exactly
what
role
the
parents
played.
there
is
a
case
in
california
involving
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
there's
a
case
in
california
involving
an
attorney
who
talks
to
a
suspect
because
the
police
asked
him
to
and
the
police
say,
“listen,
if
you
get
this
suspect
over
here
to
make
a
statement,
we'll
let
your
client
out.”
attorney
says,
"oh,
goody,"
goes
in
and
gets
the
person
to
make
a
state
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
no,
but
the
point
is
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
the
point
is
that
the
role
the
attorney
--
the
parents
play
is
the
critical
question.
if
the
parents
advise
a
minor
of
his
rights,
assist
him
in
understanding
his
rights,
in
other
words,
assist
what
miranda
is
trying
to
get
at
that
understanding
a
waiver
of
rights,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
the
parents
act
on
behalf
of
the
police
to
get
a
statement
out
of
the
minor,
analogous
to
the
attorney
example
i
just
gave
then
it's
not
a
valid
waiver
because
he's
been
duped.
that's
the
critical
difference.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
right.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
right.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
it's
just
a
hypothetical.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
logic
of
what
the
re
--
the
significance
of
the
minor's
request
is
what
we're
focusing
on.
and
if
the
minor
shows
that
he
doesn't
trust
the
police.
he's
not
sure
he's
going
to
get
the
advice
and
the
cooperation
that
he
needs
to
really
make
a
waiver
that
whatever
else
happens
doesn't
matter.
that
minor
has
asserted
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
that's
right.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
perhaps
in
the
next
crime.
i
don't
know.
the
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
he's
going
to
get
another
one
eventually,
i
suppose.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
that
would
--
that
same
rule
would
be
true.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
the
same
rule
would
be
true
of
course,
if
the
defendant
said,
“i
want
mr.
bailey
as
my
attorney.”
in
fact
mr.
bailey
was
his
attorney
and
mr.
bailey
dropped
dead.
if
he's
--
he
keeps
asking
for
his
attorney,
the
police
can't
say,
“well,
he's
dead,
therefore,
we
get
to
question
you.”
i
think
that's
a
clear
violation
of
miranda
and
that's
the
same
question.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
i
don't.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
california
supreme
court
has
held
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
no.
well,
some
are,
but
i
presume
that
this
one
wasn't.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
right.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
yes.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
i
assume
not.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
but
of
course
that's
not
the
point.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
neither
is
the
parent
and
the
california
supreme
court
has
said
that
if
a
you
--
if
a
youngster
--
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
i
wasn't
asking
a
question.
mr.
albert
j.
menaster
well,
i
hope
i
get
paid
to
answer
them.
and
my
answer
is
that
the
same
would
be
true
if
a
youngster
asks
for
an
--
for
his
parent
instead
for
an
attorney.
if
a
youngster
shows
in
a
way
that
a
youngster
would
that
that
youngster
wants
help
in
understanding
his
rights,
then
that's
an
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
it's
not
fair
to
juveniles.
it
misses
the
point
of
mckeiver
to
say
that
the
youngster
can
only
assert
his
rights
by
using
an
adult
formulation.
the
reality
is
that
youngsters
are
young
persons,
and
young
persons
ask
for
things
in
a
different
way.
it
would
be
like
making
up
a
special
word,
a
long
word
that
had
to
be
said
and
youngsters
couldn't
say
the
word.
youngster
could
--
knows
that
he
has
a
right
to
an
attorney,
but
he
also
knows
that
he
can't
hire
an
attorney.
that's
what
he
has
to
have
a
parent
or
probation
officer
for.
he
knows
that
if
they
bring
an
attorney,
he's
never
heard
of
him,
he
doesn't
know
whether
he's
going
to
be
tricked
or
not.
in
fact
the
police
are
threatening
this
minor.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
michael
was
terrified
of
the
police.
he
wants
somebody
to
give
him
a
guarantee
that
that
attorney
is
on
the
up
and
up,
and
that's
why
he's
asking
for
his
probation
officer
in
this
particular
case.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
another
point,
which
i
think
has
not
been
stressed
nearly
sufficiently
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
beyond
the
technical
miranda
issue
in
this
case
there
is
a
further
issue.
an
issue
not
referred
to
at
all
in
petitioner's
opening
argument
and
that
is
that
independent
of
the
miranda
grounds
there
is
a
second
issue
here
concerning
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
apart
from
the
request
for
the
probation
officer.
michael
repeatedly
is
asked,
in
fact
he's
asked
within
half
a
page
of
this
supposed
waiver,
“do
you
want
to
tell
us
about
the
murder?”
answer,
“no.”
petitioner
says
that's
ambiguous,
i've
been
figuring
--
trying
to
figure
out
how
that
could
possibly
be
ambiguous
and
i
still
can't
figure
it
out.
perhaps
petitioner
will
tell
us.
three
or
four
pages
later,
he's
asked,
“do
you
want
to
tell
us
what
happened?”
he
says,
“no.”
three
to
four
pages
after
that,
they
said,
“do
you
want
to
tell
us
what
happened?”
he
says,
“can't.”
finally,
after
10
pages
of
exchange
in
which
michael
makes
no
admission,
no
confession
of
any
kind,
it
wouldn't
be
usable
worth
a
wit
in
any
proceeding
before
he
makes
any
kind
of
statement,
the
police
finally
say,
“okay,
that's
it.
somebody
is
going
to
come
out
of
this
pretty
good
and
the
one
who
tells
us
what
happen
is
the
one
who's
not
going
to
get
hassled.”
michael
then
--
there's
been
a
pause
in
the
recording
and,
during
that
pause
described
by
both
trial
counsel
and
the
trial
court,
that's
characterized
as
crying.
so,
michael's
threatened.
he
cries.
he
breaks
down
and
then
he
immediately
makes
the
statement.
that's
the
form
--
forms
the
basis
for
this
confession.
now,
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
that's
not
an
involuntary
statement
forgetting
miranda.
just
on
the
standard
voluntariness
totality
of
circumstances
test.
it
seems
to
me,
the
petitioner
has
not
dealt
with
that
problem
and
that
petitioner
needs
to.
let
me
go
back
then
to
the
critical
issue
that
i
think
applies
to
this
case.
this
court
has
to
decide
whether
juveniles
are
going
to
be
treated
like
juveniles
when
it
comes
to
jury
trials
perhaps
bail.
but,
when
it
comes
to
miranda,
we're
going
to
make
juveniles
be
adults
and
use
adult
words
in
order
to
invoke
a
right
when
they
clearly
are
terrified,
they're
being
threatened,
they're
asking
for
help.
i
find
it
amazing,
amazing
that
petitioner
characterizes
this
as
simply
an
informational
inquiry.
i
suppose
michael
--
the
theories
that
michael
would
like
to
come
before
this
court
and
go
to
the
police
station
and
say,
“well,
i
have
an
academic
question.
i'm
writing
kind
of
a
thesis
on
constitutional
rights.
could
you
just
tell
me
what
you
think
the
supreme
court
will
decide
and
whether
i
have
the
right
to
a
probation
officer
or
not?”
i
think
that
that's
an
incredible
reading
of
this
record,
unbelievable
reading
of
this
record.
and
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
this
record
is
that
michael
wanted
help
because
he
wanted
to
make
sure
he
wasn't
going
to
be
tricked.
in
fact,
he
got
tricked
i
contend.
the
point
is
that
michael
ought
to
be
treated
as
a
juvenile
because
he
was
a
juvenile
at
the
time
of
this
case.
he
was
treated
as
a
juvenile
and
it
is
artificial
and
unrealistic
to
expect
that
only
a
request
in
adult
terms
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
what
miranda
was
talking
about
when
it
was
talking
about
protections.
incidentally,
i
would
like
to
disagree
with
petitioner
on
one
further
point
and
that
is
i
think
miranda
applies
to
juveniles.
we
have
yet
a
further
extension
by
petitioner
in
this
case.
petitioner
wants
this
court
to
treat
juveniles
like
juveniles
when
it
comes
to
jury
trials
but
don't
treat
them
like
adults
even
if
they
ask
for
attorneys,
a
request
which
would
invoke
miranda
in
any
adult
case.
it's
an
incredible
position,
a
position
not
mentioned
in
the
briefs
incidentally
and
one
which
i
think
this
court
should
summarily
reject.
this
court
has
to
decide
in
this
case
how
to
apply
miranda
to
juveniles.
this
is
not
an
extension
of
miranda.
it
is
an
application
of
miranda.
this
court
will
choose
either
to
apply
miranda
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
artificial
and
require
juveniles
to
be
adults
when
they're
not
required
anywhere
else
to
be
adults
where
it
will
recognize
the
realities
of
a
juvenile
situation.
and
it
will
conclude
that
where
a
juvenile
shows
that
that
juvenile
wants
help,
that
it
is
not
fair,
it
is
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
for
the
police
to
continue
to
interrogate
him.
i'd
like
to
close
with
just
two
thoughts.
first
of
all,
the
incredible
argument
by
petitioner
that
there
was
an
equivocal
waiver
in
this
case
and
true,
once
michael
says,
“yes,”
sandwiched
in
between
all
of
these
no's
and
what
about
being
tricked
and
that
sort
of
thing
reminds
me
of
a
wizard
of
a
cartoon
where
the
king
says
to
the
lawyer,
“your
client
confessed,”
and
the
lawyer
says,
“how
do
i
know
it
was
voluntary?”
and
the
king
says,
“because
look,
there's
your
client's
signature
right
there
underneath
the
bloodstains.”
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
situation
michael
made
an
equivocal
waiver
but
he
did
everything
else
he
could
possible
think
of
to
say
he
didn't
want
to
waive.
he
showed
fear.
he
showed
anxiety.
he
asserted
his
rights
under
the
old
involuntariness
test,
i
submit,
that
michael
clearly
asserted
his
rights
sufficiently
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment,
apart
from
any
miranda
consideration.
i
think
that
the
bottom
line
of
this
case
is
that
petitioner
in
this
case
is
arguing
that
because
of
the
technical
nature
of
miranda
we
have
to
be
very
cautious
in
analyzing
what
kinds
of
things
we're
going
to
technically
invoke.
it
reminds
me
of
a
quotation
from
justice
wisdom
who
said
that
if
police
efficiency
were
the
only
important
thing
then
the
rack
would
be
alright.
there
are
things
more
important
than
police
efficiency,
and
they
happen
to
be
listed
in
the
bill
of
rights.
i
charge
this
court
with
deciding
whether
juveniles
are
juveniles.
whether
miranda
applies
to
juveniles
and
recognizes
the
reality
of
juveniles
or
whether
this
court
will
hide
its
head
in
the
sand,
pretend
juveniles
are
adults,
deny
them
rights
when
that
argument
is
made,
but
deny
them
rights
when
they
assert
what
are
juvenile
rights
in
the
same
context.
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
carefully
consider
the
decision
in
this
case
for
the
impact
it
will
have
on
probation
systems
on
juvenile
systems
throughout
this
nation.
