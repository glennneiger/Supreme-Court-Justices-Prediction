we'll
hear
arguments
in
fare
against
michael
c.,
beginning
at
1
o'clock.
mr.
hart,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
the
strict
miranda
rule
as
you
put
it
should
not
be
applied
to
juveniles
because
they
are
not
exposed
to
a
criminal
punishment,
is
that
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
was
putting
the
question
in
another
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
a
step
and
it
has
been
taken.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
that
said
along
before
miranda?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
believe
mr.
justice
jackson
said
any
lawyer
worth
this
all
who's
going
to
tell
the
client
not
to
talk
until
he,
the
lawyer,
knows
in
private
what
he's
going
to
say.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
after
he'd
had
the
private
conversation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
could
hardly
expect
this
respondent
here
to
know
about
that
obligation
of
the
probation
officer,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
the
clergyman
would
surely
be
bound
by
confidence
with
respect
to
anything
imparted
to
him,
whereas
the
probation
officer
would
be
in
a
contrary
position,
would
he
not?
he'd
be
bound
to
report
this
to
the
courts
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
hazard
a
guess
or
you
don't
have
to
if
you
don't
want
to,
as
to
what
the
supreme
court
of
california
might
have
done
if
the
probation
officer
had
indeed
come
in
response
to
a
call
and
privately
advised
the
respondent
to
tell
everything
and
then
it
came
to
the
california
supreme
court
in
that
posture.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
not
be
the
state
of
california
advising
the
man
to
surrender
his
rights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
--
when
you
say
“certainly,”
do
you
mean
that's
probably
what
the
supreme
court
of
california
would
decide?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
a
dangerous
guess
anyway.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
fellow
in
this
posture
would
be
inclined
to
have
all
these
nuisances
that
a
lawyer
or
a
law
student
might
put
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
menaster,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
they
used
the
term
or
not,
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
all
know
he's
a
minor.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
this
record
does
not
show
that
he
was
advised
of
his
rights
by
an
officer
of
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
aren't
they
the
--
you
say
a
number,
do
you
exclude
from
that
the
critical
advice
that
we're
here
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
you're
going
to
apply
that
generally
or
just
to
this
juvenile?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
much
use
on
your
theory,
there
isn't
much
use
in
giving
the
warning.
it's
a
--
it's
just
redirect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
counsel
if
the
probation
officer
had
come,
had
a
private
conversation
with
the
young
man
for
a
half
hour
or
an
hour
then
came
in
and
said,
“i've
advised
my
client
or
my
--
whatever
they
call
him,
patient
or
my
charge
to
tell
you
the
whole
story.
i
think
in
the
long
run
that's
going
to
be
the
best
thing
for
him.”
and
then
he
told
the
whole
story.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
no.
we
ask
a
lot
of
hypothetical
questions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
a
lawyer
who
advises
his
client
to
tell
the
truth
and
throw
himself
on
the
mercy
of
the
court
is
acting
like
a
prosecutor
in
every
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
emphasized
that
under
this
california
statute
the
probation
officer
must
act
in
loco
parentis
in
every
situation.
suppose
you
had
a
16-year-old
was
--
not
on
probation,
no
prior
criminal
record,
in
the
same
posture
and
he
said,
“i
want
to
talk
to
my
father
first
and
my
mother.”
and
the
father
and
mother
are
brought
in.
they
spend
an
hour
talking
alone
and
i'm
sure
you
can
find
many
cases
on
record
precisely
to
this
effect,
and
then
they
come
out
and
the
father
says,
“we
have
decided
to
tell
joseph
to
tell
everything.
we
think
that's
in
his
best
interest.”
and
then
he
tells
everything.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
suppressible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
played
the
role
that
i've
just
described.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
another
case.
i
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
care
to
address
my
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
