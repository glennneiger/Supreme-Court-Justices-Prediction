justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
suggest,
do
you,
mr.
hart,
that
if
there
had
been
no
miranda
warning,
a
finding
of
voluntariness
would
save
the
case
under
miranda?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
this
were
an
adult
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
form
--
the
question
was,
as
you
say,
just
a
request
for
information,
“can
i
have
my
probation
officer
here?”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
miranda
say
that
the
police
must
advice
him
of
his
right
to
an
attorney,
not
that
he
--
they
can
question
him
only
if
he
raises
it
on
his
own
motion,
so
to
speak?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
isn't
a
question
of
the
juvenile
having
to
think
up
a
right
to
an
attorney.
the
police
have
to
tell
him
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
michael
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
michael
wasn't
a
10-year-old,
was
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
they
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
a
22-year-old
necessarily
know
how
to
get
an
attorney?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
menaster,
a
moment
ago
i
thought
you
said
that
the
california's
supreme
court's
decision
turned
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
i
want
to
ask
you
about
the
language
at
page
25
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
where
they
say,
“here,
however,
we
face
conduct
which
regardless
of
considerations
of
capacity,
coercion,
or
voluntariness,
per
se,
invokes
he
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
thus,
our
question
turns
not
on
whether
the
defendant
had
the
ability
and
capacity
or
willingness
to
give
a
knowledgeable
waiver
and
henceforth
he
acted
voluntarily
but
whether
when
he
called
for
his
probation
officer
he
exercised
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.”
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
per
se
rule
not
under
these
particular
facts
of
this
particular
--
