would
it

justice
potter
stewart
--
would
it
be
with
an
adult
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
okay
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
miranda
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
it
should
be,
but
except
in
the
miranda
case,
would
it
be?
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
the
miranda
say
if
he
asks
of
a
lawyer,
interrogation
must
cease
until
he
gets
a
lawyer?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
a
lot
of
language
that's
not
necessary
to
the
decision
in
the
miranda
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
the
miranda
test
though.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
formally
at
least,
was
not
a
request,
it
was
just
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
have
the
probation
officer
there
was
just
a
request
for
information,
“can
i?”
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
quarrel
with
the
supreme
court's
equating
that
with
a
request
for
the
probation
officer,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
“may
i”
or
“i
would
like
to
have
my
probation
officer
here.”
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
quarrel
with
their
equating
that
with,
“i
request
that
my
probation
officer
be
here.”
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
here
too?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you
think
there
should
perhaps
be
one
rule
if
he
just
says,
“can
i
have
my
probation
officer
here?”
and
another
rule,
“i
request
that
my
probation
officer
be
here”?
justice
potter
stewart
then
why
do
you
quarrel
with
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
think
there
are
two
different
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
if
you
think
he's
not
speaking
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
he'd
ask,
“can
i
have
my
teddy
bear?”
justice
potter
stewart
well,
why
--
why
should
it?
he's
a
juvenile
by
definition.
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
this
is
a
nine-year-old
juvenile.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
a
request
in
other
words
is
the
equivalent
of
saying,
“i
refuse
to
answer
relying
upon
my
right
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment.”
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
--
the
california
supreme
court
has
held
that
a
request
by
a
juvenile
to
have
his
probation
officer
or
more
accurately
in
this
case,
a
request
of
whether
he
could
have
his
probation
officer
here
was
the
equivalent
of
saying,
“i
refuse
to
answer
your
questions
based
upon
my
rights
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.”
justice
potter
stewart
per
se?
justice
potter
stewart
not
just
one
of
the
circumstances
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
totality?
justice
potter
stewart
and
dentists,
i
suppose
and
doctors
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
older
brothers
and
sisters?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
you're
paid
by
the
same
people
too,
aren't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
did
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
your
client
have
--
was
he
an
orphan?
justice
potter
stewart
he
did
have
a
mother.
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
have
a
mother
and
a
father?
justice
potter
stewart
then
why
was
there
any
occasion
of
a
in
loco
parentis?
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
were
true
parents?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
also,
the
state
would
be
free
to
put
him
in
the
gas
chamber
and
kill
him
too
on
conviction
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
he
was
an
adult.
