is
it
not
correct
that
what
you're
arguing
is
that
even
if
he'd
asked
for
a
lawyer,
the
miranda
should
not
have
applied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
it's
still
the
same
technical
obstacle.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
--
instead
of
--
everything
is
exactly
the
same
in
the
transcript,
except
he
says,
“i
want
a
lawyer”
instead
of,
“i
want
a
probation
officer.”
you'd
still
say
miranda
should
not
apply
because
it's
a
juvenile.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
submission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
well,
supposing
he
said,
“i
want
my
lawyer
present
now.”
and
they
had
said,
“well,
we're
sorry,
we
can't
reach
him
right
now.
do
you
mind
going
ahead
with
the
questioning?”
and
he
said,
“well,
okay,
if
you
can't
get
him,
i'll
go
ahead
with
the
questioning.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
another
aspect
of
it,
he
was
suspicious
that
the
person
the
police
might
bring
in
might
not
in
fact
be
a
lawyer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
probation
officer
had
assured
him
that
this
third
party
was
in
fact
a
lawyer
perhaps
he
wouldn't
have
had
that
concern
because
presumably
he
trusted
his
probation
officer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
suppose
he
asked
for
a
probation
officer?
what
do
you
suppose
motivated
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
know,
i
followed
his
statement,
i
don't
think
i
could
trust
whoever
you'd
bring
in,
that
i
--
did
--
isn't
it
fair
to
infer
that
he
thought
he
could
trust
--
