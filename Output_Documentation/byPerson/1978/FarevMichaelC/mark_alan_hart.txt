mr.
mark
alan
hart
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
mark
alan
hart,
deputy
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california,
appearing
as
counsel
for
petitioner.
miranda
versus
arizona
opened
a
new
chapter
in
the
law
of
confessions,
a
chapter
that
began
with
precise
rules
to
guide
law
enforcement
in
the
conducting
of
a
custodial
interrogation
but
has
over
the
years
been
read
with
some
different
and
expanded
interpretations.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
california
supreme
court
has
applied
the
strict
miranda
rules
with
one
addition,
that
a
juvenile
who
requests
his
probation
officer
per
se
invokes
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
be
silent,
no
less
than
if
he
asks
for
an
attorney,
and
that
his
statements
must
be
suppressed
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
they
were
in
fact
involuntary.
the
operative
facts
are
brief.
on
the
evening
of
january
19,
1976,
robert
and
helen
yeager
were
on
their
way
to
their
home
in
the
san
fernando
valley
section
of
los
angeles.
unbeknownst
to
them,
respondent
and
two
of
his
friends
were
following
in
a
pickup
truck
being
driven
by
respondent.
they
were
looking
for
someone
to
rob.
they
were
looking
for
money
and
they
had
a
gun.
the
yeager's
arrived
home.
respondent
and
his
friends
approached
the
house,
approached
mr.
yeager
and
during
the
course
of
an
attempted
robbery,
one
of
the
other
minors
shot
mr.
yeager
and
killed
him.
respondent
was
apprehended
and
brought
into
the
police
station
for
questioning.
he
was
16
years
old
at
the
time
of
the
offense
and
he
had
had
prior
experience
with
the
juvenile
court
system
including
serving
some
time
in
a
youth
camp.
he
was
given
the
standard
miranda
admonition.
he
was
told
that
he
had
a
right
to
remain
silent,
was
told
that
anything
he
said
could
and
would
be
used
against
him
in
a
court
of
law,
that
he
had
a
right
to
an
attorney,
that
if
he
could
not
afford
one,
one
would
be
appointed
for
him
at
--
without
his
expense
and
that
he
had
a
right
to
have
the
attorney
present
during
all
stages
of
interrogation.
he
was
asked
if
he
understood
his
rights
and
if
he
wanted
to
talk
to
the
officers.
he
indicated
that
he
did
and
that
he
might
talk
but
when
asked
if
he
would
give
up
his
right
to
an
attorney
present,
he
responded,
“can
i
have
my
probation
officer
here?”
to
this,
the
officers
replied,
“well,
no.
we
can't
call
your
probation
officer
right
now,
but
you
have
a
right
to
an
attorney.”
and,
respondent's
response
was,
“well,
how
do
i
know
you
guys
won't
--
pull
no
police
officer
in
and
then
tell
me
he's
an
attorney?”
and,
to
this,
respondent
was
re-admonished
as
to
the
standard
miranda
rights.
he
was
told,
“you
can
have
an
attorney.
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
us
at
all
if
you
don't
want
to.
if
you
want
to
talk
to
us
without
an
attorney
present,
you
can
talk
to
us.
if
you
don't
want
to,
you
don't
have
to.
that's
your
right.
do
you
understand
that
right?”
respondent
indicated
that
he
did
understand
that
right
and,
when
asked
if
he
would
talk
to
him
without
--
talk
to
them
without
an
attorney
present,
respondent
replied,
“yeah,
i
want
to
talk
to
you.”
later
during
the
interview,
respondent
confessed
to
having
participated
in
the
offense.
juvenile
court
proceedings
were
instituted.
respondent's
confession
was
admitted
into
evidence
and
several
other
things
were
established
during
the
proceedings,
including
the
fact
that
respondent
had
been
on
probation
that
his
probation
officer
had
counseled
him
as
to
some
family
problems,
but
that
the
probation
officer
under
california
law
was
a
peace
officer
and
that
respondent
was
told
this.
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
of
voluntariness.
respondent
was
declared
a
ward
of
the
court
for
having
committed
a
murder.
in
reversing
the
judgment,
the
california
supreme
court
has
taken
the
miranda
exclusionary
rule
and
applied
the
language
dealing
with
request
for
legal
counsel
one
step
further.
they've
applied
it
to
probation
officers,
by
statute
peace
officers,
in
california.
it
is
positioner--
petitioner's
position,
the
instant
confession
was
obtained
after
a
fully
informed
waiver
of
fifth
amendment
rights,
including
the
right
to
legal
counsel,
that
the
admonitions
--
both
admonitions
given
to
respondent
in
his
statements,
before
and
after
each,
indicate
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
and
that
the
statements
were
properly
admitted.
respondent's
request
to
see
his
probation
officer
was
at
most
an
ambiguity
at
the
waiver
stage.
and
it
was
clarified
by
the
further
admonition
in
the
additional
waiver
obtained
that
respondent
had
a
clear
desire
to
speak.
petitioner
suggests
to
this
court
the
following
rule
or
the
following
approach
to
this
kind
of
situation.
that
when
interrogating
officers
are
faced
with
an
ambiguous
response
to
a
miranda
advisement
they
should
be
permitted
to
clarify
the
statement
with
further
questioning
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
in
fact
the
suspect
is
expressing
an
unwillingness
to
speak
or
merely
making
an
information
or
request.
if
upon
asking
those
clarification
questions
it
is
clear
the
suspect
is
not
invoking
his
fifth
amendment
right
as
is
the
case
here
then
police
should
be
com
--
permitted
to
begin
an
interrogation.
there
are
several
things
in
the
instant
case,
the
petitioner
submits.
give
this
court
an
indication
of
the
voluntariness
of
respondent's
statement.
and
that
we
submit
is
the
only
permissible
goal
under
the
fifth
amendment
whether
the
statement
was
voluntary
product
not
obtained
by
overriding
the
suspect's
free
will
and
based
on
an
informed
waiver
of
rights.
number
one,
respondent
nowhere
alleges
that
it
was
an
uninformed
waiver
or
that
he
did
not
understand
his
right
to
an
attorney
or
anything
about
the
miranda
rights
was
unclear
to
him.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
respectfully,
while
that
issue
need
not
be
reached
in
this
case,
we
would
suggest
that
the
miranda
warnings
are
not
necessarily
applicable
to
juvenile
proceedings.
this
court
has
noted
and
respondent
has
conceded
in
his
briefs
on
the
merits
that
this
court
has
never
specifically
applied
the
precise
miranda
exclusionary
rule
to
juvenile
court.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
in
an
adult
proceeding,
the
miranda
rule
is
presently
the
law
of
the
land
and
the
miranda
admonitions
would,
of
course,
apply.
they
are
perhaps
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
yes,
he
was.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
this
was
in
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
when
he
made
the
questions
and
answered
the
police,
he
was
arrested
as
a
juvenile
suspect.
he
was
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
the
difference
is
this.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
juvenile
proceedings,
while
adversary
in
nature,
are
interested
in
some
different
societal
goals
in
the
adult
criminal
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
certainly
not.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
because
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
coercion.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
correct.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
the
fifth
amendment
does
apply
to
juveniles,
as
this
court
said
so
in,
in
re
gault.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
we
would
concede
the
fifth
amendment
applies
to
juveniles.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
however,
we
take
the
following
position
by
analogy
to
mckeiver
versus
pennsylvania.
what
applies
to
juveniles
are
the
essentials
of
fairness
within
the
due
process
clause,
not
necessarily
all
of
the
procedural
formalities
that
would
apply
in
adult
court
because
juvenile
proceedings,
although
adversary
in
nature,
are
instituted
on
behalf
of
the
minor.
the
concern
of
the
court
is
to
find
what
the
best
disposition
is
for
the
minor.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
as
such
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
well,
that
was
--
that
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
juvenile
proceedings
in
california,
and
i
believe
in
most
states,
are
instituted
in
--
on
behalf
of
the
minor.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
this
court
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
not
necessarily.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
yes.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
not
necessarily
your
honor.
if
the
court
looks
at
the
proceedings
in
california
as
adversary
in
nature
but
not
strictly
criminal
then
based
on
in
re
gault
and
mckeiver
versus
pennsylvania,
what
the
court
wants
to
apply
to
juveniles
is
the
essentials
of
fairness.
now,
if
we
can
have
a
voluntary
statement
that
is
the
product
of
an
informed
knowledgeable
waiver
but
there
has
been
a
technical
miranda
defect,
that
doesn't
necessarily
violate
the
fifth
amendment's
prescription
against
compelled
confessions.
particularly
the
case
where
we're
concerned
--
what
we're
dealing
with
the
system
that
isn't
strictly
criminal,
we're
instituting
proceedings
on
the
minor's
behalf
and
we're
looking
for
the
best
disposition
for
the
minor.
in
that
case,
artificial
barriers
to
the
truth
seeking
process
should
be
eliminated.
we
submit
that
the
strict
miranda
exclusionary
rule
is,
at
times,
an
artificial
barrier.
this
case
is
a
perfect
example.
the
california
supreme
court
says,
“per
se,
a
juvenile
who
asks
for
his
probation
officer
is
invoking
his
fifth
amendment
right
and
we
don't
need
to
consider
whether
the
statement
was
in
fact
voluntary.”
if
there
is
that
statement,
it
must
be
suppressed.
i
submit
that
is
an
artificial
barrier
to
voluntariness
and
it
results
in
an
otherwise
permissible
confession
under
the
traditional
fifth
amendment
view,
the
view
--
the
pre-miranda
view
being
excluded.
there
is
no
basis
for
that
kind
of
application
in
this
case
--
to
--
in
the
juvenile
court.of
course
in
this
case
our
position
is
the
minor
was
fully
mirandized.
he
was
given
the
standard
miranda
warnings
and
there's
no
basis
for
extending
miranda
beyond
that.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
what
we
say
is
that
we
shouldn't
have
artificial
barriers
to
the
truth
seeking
process.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
okay.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
our
position
is
that
while
they
are
in
a
sense
subject
to
custody,
there
are
other
societal
values
at
stake
that
do
not
necessarily
exist
in
the
adult
system.
the
disposition
in
california
is
supposed
to
be
on
the
minor's
behalf,
and
the
gravity
of
the
offense
doesn't
necessarily
determine
what
the
ultimate
disposition
of
the
minor
would
be.
now,
if
a
technical
miranda
defect
bars
the
court
from
reaching
the
true
decision
as
to
what's
best
for
the
minor,
we
submit
that's
wrong
and
we
submit
that
it
isn't
justified
by
the
fifth
amendment.
all
we
need
provide
the
minors
under
mckeiver
and
gault
--
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
alan
hart
well
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
certainly,
if
he
conditioned
his
willingness
to
talk
on
the
presence
of
a
lawyer.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
i
submit
that
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
a
strict
miranda
exclusionary
rule
should
not
apply.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
if
he
would
--
if
he
says,
“can
i
have
my
lawyer
present?”
and
they
say,
“yes,
you
can.”
and
then
he
says,
“then,
i
want
him
here
before
you
question
me,”
certainly
that's
an
invocation.
but,
if
he
says,
“can
i
have
my
lawyer
present?”
and
he
says,
“well,
i'll
go
ahead
and
talk
to
you
anyway,”
that's
not
an
invocation.
but
we
submit
that
the
strict
exclusionary
rule
which
excludes
otherwise
voluntary
statements
because
the
suspect
has
uttered
magic
words
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
we
submit
that's
permissible.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
that's
permissible.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
we
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
each
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
--
our
position
is
that
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
--
it
should
be.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
alright,
except
in
the
miranda
case,
i
think
it
that
would
still
be
a
permissible
type
of
questioning.
under
miranda,
certainly,
if
the
suspect
asks
for
a
lawyer
and
wants
him
present
during
interrogation,
interrogation
has
to
cease.
but
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
there
is
language
to
that
effect,
but
it
isn't
necessary
to
the
disposition
granted.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
we
would
submit
--
we
would
offer
the
following
example.
there's
a
case
in
california
upon
which
this
case
built,
people
versus
randall,
which
held
that
any
indication
which
recently
--
reasonably
appears
inconsistent
with
the
present
willingness
to
discuss
the
case
freely
is
an
invocation
of
the
right.
in
randall,
the
suspect
was
arrested
and
mirandized
and
asked
to
call
his
attorney.
he
called
his
attorney,
spoke
to
his
attorney,
told
his
attorney
the
situation,
and
the
attorney
did
not
advise
him
to
remain
silent.
after
that
the
suspect,
i
believe,
was
re-mirandized
and
agreed
to
talk
to
the
officers.
now,
there's
an
indication
where
the
suspect
clearly
wanted
his
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
excuse
the
colloquial.
he
was
admonished
per
the
miranda
opinion
as
to
what
his
rights
were
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
thank
you
your
honor.
in
any
case,
the
suspect
in
randall,
and
by
the
way
that
confession
was
excluded
by
the
california
supreme
court
but
we
submit,
it
was
voluntary
under
fifth
amendment
standards.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
that's
true,
that's
true
and
to
that
extent
the
miranda
test
is
a
departure
from
the
lauadble
goals
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
goals
that
i
think
this
court
was
attempting
to
pursue
in
the
miranda
opinion.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
that's
true
and
certainly
the
decision
in
this
course
--
in
this
case
doesn't
turn
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
technical
miranda
defect
because,
as
far
as
the
admonitions
required
in
the
miranda
opinion,
those
were
complied
with
in
this
case.
beyond
that,
there
were
a
number
of
other
considerations
of
voluntariness.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
no.
the
lawyer
did
not
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
no,
he
didn't
say
one
thing
or
another.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
right.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
well,
i
think
the
pre
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
the
presence
of
a
lawyer
during
an
interrogation
is
not
necessarily
so
that
the
lawyer
would
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
but
there
may
be
occasions
when
it
will
be
to
the
suspect's
advantage
to
talk
particularly
if
he
had
a
good
alibi
and
the
lawyer
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
certainly.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
well,
we
submit
your
honor
that
there
might
be
indications
where
a
lawyer
would
not
make
that
statement
to
his
client.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
but
along
those
lines
your
honor,
returning
to
this
case,
certainly
a
probation
officer
is
not
going
to
be
in
the
same
position.
as
a
matter
of
fact
is,
california's
justice
mosk
noted
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
this
case,
the
probation
officer
as
a
peace
officer
is
probably
under
an
obligation
to
counsel
his
charge
to
cooperate
fully
with
law
enforcement
officials.
this
probation
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
well,
number
one,
your
honor,
the
record
indicates
that
respondent
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
his
probation
officer
was
a
peace
officer.
number
two,
the
record
indicates,
and
the
trial
court
made
a
finding,
that
this
respondent
had
prior
experience
with
the
juvenile
court
system,
presumably
had
an
attorney
at
that
prior
experience
and
understood
what
he
was
waiving.
number
three,
respondent
nowhere
alleges
in
any
of
his
briefs
that
he
didn't
understand
what
an
attorney
was
or
what
an
attorney
could
do
for
him
or
that
he
thought
his
probation
officer
could
perform
the
functions
of
legal
counsel.
but,
number
four,
there
is
no
justification
for
the
per
se
rule
adopted
by
the
california
supreme
court
below.
it
cannot
be
said
that
any
juvenile
who
asks
for
the
presence
of
his
probation
officer
is
invoking
the
legal
counsel
language
of
miranda.
and
it's
interesting,
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
opinion
below,
distinguished
or
attempted
to
distinguish
this
kind
of
request
from
a
request
say
for
a
clergyman
or
a
football
coach,
and
said
that
since
the
probation
officer
is
someone
who
has
a
legally
recognized
relationship
with
the
minor,
request
for
a
probation
officer
would
be
reasonably
interpreted
as
a
request
for
counsel
within
the
meaning
of
miranda.
petitioner
submits
that
that
conclusion
does
not
follow
from
their
analysis.
the
clergyman,
for
example,
also
in
california,
has
a
legally
recognized
relationship
with
a
particular
penitent.
there
is
a
penitent
privilege.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
exactly,
which
--
by
statute
in
california,
the
probation
officer
investigates
--
alleges
a
--
allegations
against
minors,
brings
the
--
sources
those
investigations
to
the
district
attorney
or
to
the
local
prosecuting
authority.
at
the
time
this
instant
case
began
in
the
juvenile
court
the
probation
officer
by
statute
actually
filed
the
petition
alleging
that
the
minor
was
a
ward
of
the
court
and
had
committed
a
certain
offense.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
okay,
two
responses
to
that
without
making
a
guess.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
it
would
be,
certainly.
first
of
all
under
california
law
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
they
would
decide.
i
would
say,
first,
under
california
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
okay,
let
me
inform
the
court
of
the
premise
for
my
guess.
first,
under
california
law,
the
probation
officer
would
have
to
advice
the
minor
of
his
constitutional
rights
himself
as
a
peace
officer.
number
two,
again
referring
to
justice
mosk's
opinion,
he
speculates
as
to
just
that
problem
and
talks
about
the
mutt-and-jeff
situation
that
this
court
referred
to
in
miranda
where
you
have
a
friendly
peace
officer
and
an
adversary
peace
officer
working
at
odds
with
each
other,
and
he
says
“the
case
is
going
to
come
to
us
and
surely,
when
it
does,
i
don't
know
what
we're
going
to
do
with
it.”
now,
with
that
premise
in
mind,
my
guess
would
be
that
the
california
supreme
court
would
find
that
by
statute
the
probation
officer
is
a
peace
officer
and
that
in
that
kind
of
situation
the
advice
the
minor
receive
from
the
probation
officer
was
not
the
advice
of
counsel
and
did
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
miranda.
and
that
it
would
be
just
what
the
court
suggested
that
it
would
be
a
peace
officer
or
the
state
of
california
advising
the
minor
to
cooperate.
that's
the
prob
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
that's
true.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
well,
that's
a
possibility
except,
i
think
the
fact
that
he
was
re-admonished
after
he
made
that
suspicion
and
told
that
he
didn't
have
to
talk
at
all,
that
was
his
right.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
personally,
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
just
an
informational
question.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
well,
there's
some
indication
in
the
record
your
honor
that
he
had
been
told
by
the
probation
officer
to
contact
the
probation
officer
whenever
he
had
law
enforcement
contact.
and
certainly
any
offense
that
he
might
have
committed
would've
potentially
been
a
violation
of
the
conditions
of
his
probation
and
the
probation
officer
would've
wanted
to
know
about
it.
so
that
perhaps
is
the
reason
although
i
really
can't
speculate.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
i
think
there's
some
indications
he
trusted
the
probation
officer
and
i
think
that
the
trust
would've
been
misplaced
if
he
felt
that
--
if
he
wanted
the
probation
officer
to
act
as
counsel.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
true.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
true.
petitioner
doesn't
suggest
that
looking
at
all
of
the
minor's
statements
and
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
his
prior
experience
with
the
law
enforcement
officials
that
the
trier
of
fact
could
not
have
found,
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
that
this
minor
was
invoking
his
right
to
silence.
but
the
rule
is,
in
california,
that
any
minor
who
asks
for
his
probation
officer
per
se
invokes
his
right
to
silence
under
miranda.
but
if
he
asks
for
any
other
confidant,
a
clergyman
or
a
football
coach
the
court
will
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
fifth
amendment
and
miranda
do
not
justify
that
kind
of
approach.
moreover,
the
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
yes,
and
he
was
told
he
couldn't.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
well,
if
it
was
a
request
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
he
certainly
didn't
condition
his
willingness
to
talk
on
the
presence
of
a
probation
officer.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
well,
we
do
quarrel
with
it.
we
quarreled
with
it
below.
we
claimed
that
it
was
an
information
or
request.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
and
we
do
here,
too.
we
don't
believe
that
this
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
not
unless
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
well,
we
quarrel
with
it
because
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
if
he
said
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
if
he
says,
“can
i
have
my
probation
officer
here
and
i'm
conditioning
my
acceptance
to
speak
on
the
presence
of
the
probation
officer.”
that's
one
thing.
other
than
that
there
isn't
any
distinction
and
we
wouldn't
quarrel
with
it.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
perhaps
not,
nor
would
an
adult
criminal
offender
necessarily
have
all
of
the
nuisances,
but
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
then,
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
that's
correct,
and
we
submit
that
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
his
further
waiver
in
agreement
to
talk
is
all
the
more
voluntary
because
he
fully
understood.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
our
position
is
at
most
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
he
was
told
that
he
could
not
have
the
probation
office
there.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
following
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
was
told,
“look,
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
us
at
all
if
you
don't
want
to.”
mr.
mark
alan
hart
at
most,
the
request
for
--
mr.
mark
alan
hart
at
most,
that
was
an
ambiguous
statement
which
police
sought
to
clarify.
the
interrogation
--
the
process
of
interrogation
had
not
begun
at
that
point.
the
police
were
seeking
to
clarify
whether
this
minor
was
invoking
his
right
to
silence.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
the
question
is
not
ambiguous.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
and
they
told
him
he
didn't
have
to
talk
right
then
at
all.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
right.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
and
--
i
submit
the
minor
fully
understood
and
the
trial
court
found
that
he
fully
understood
that
he
didn't
have
to
talk
to
them
then
if
he
didn't
want
to
without
the
presence
of
the
probation
officer,
and
he
agreed
to
talk
to
them
at
that
time
and
the
trial
court
found
that
that
was
a
complete
waiver.
we
submit
that
the
laudable
goals
of
this
court
in
miranda
protecting
against
compelled
confessions
and
insuring
that
a
suspect
who
waives
his
fifth
amendment
rights
is
fully
informed
as
to
what
he's
doing.
those
goals
were
fulfilled
in
the
instant
case.
this
confession
was
absolutely
voluntary
and
there
is
no
justification
for
the
per
se
rule
that
any
minor
who
asks
for
his
probation
officer
is
asking
for
counsel
within
the
meaning
of
miranda.
we
will
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
mark
alan
hart
the
problem
with
the
magic
words
approach
adopted
by
the
california
supreme
court
that
a
request
for
a
probation
officer
is
per
se
a
fifth
amendment
invocation
is
that
it
does
not
necessarily
bear
any
relationship
to
the
fifth
amendment.
we
submit
that
this
approach
of
attempting
to
determine
or
predict
the
subjective
intent
of
any
minor
who
asks
for
his
probation
officer
takes
away
the
traditional
role
of
the
trier
of
fact
to
determine
if
in
a
given
instance
a
minor
is
making
a
voluntary
statement.
the
critical
factor
in
miranda
was
whether
a
suspect
wanted
to
speak.
this
court
found
that
a
request
for
an
attorney
is
reasonably
an
indication
that
a
suspect
doesn't
want
to
speak.
there
is
no
basis
for
the
same
reasonable
per
--
the
same
conclusion
and
the
same
per
se
rule
with
respect
to
probation
officers.
this
court
noted
that
in,
in
re
gault
when
the
state
of
arizona
attempted
to
argue
that
they
didn't
have
to
provide
the
minor
with
counsel
because
the
probation
officer
could
provide
him
all
of
the
services
of
the
attorney
and
this
court
rejected
that.
noted
that
probation
officers
in
the
arizona
scheme
were
also
peace
officers
and
that
they
initiate
proceedings
involving
the
minor
and
they
could
not
provide
the
same
assistance.
if
a
probation
officer
cannot
fulfill
the
traditional
goals
of
legal
counsel
then
a
rule
which
said
any
minor
per
se
invokes
his
fifth
amendment
right
by
asking
for
his
probation
officer
bears
no
relation
to
the
goals
of
the
miranda
court
and
bears
no
relation
to
the
fifth
amendment.
i'd
like
to
talk
just
briefly
about
the
other
contention
of
respondent
that
indications
in
the
record,
apart
from
the
request
of
the
probation
officer,
indicate
that
the
minor
was
invoking
his
rights.
respondent
isolates
all
of
those
statements
from
the
context
of
the
record,
and
i
think
we've
discussed
it
pretty
well
in
our
brief.
for
example,
the
first
one
that
respondent
mentioned
where
he
was
asked
about
the
murder
and
he
says,
“no.”
what
he
said
was,
“no,
i
don't
know
anything
about
it.”
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
course
of
any
interrogation
or
any
conversation
there
are
going
to
be
times
when
there's
a
hesitation.
there
are
going
to
be
times
when
a
suspect
may
deny
participation
in
an
offense
but
each
one
of
those
is
not
a
separate
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
it's
something
for
the
trier
of
fact
to
look
at.
the
trier
of
fact
in
this
case
and
the
california
court
of
appeals
and
the
california
supreme
court,
all
found
that
none
of
those
were
indications
of
the
fifth
amendment
invocation.
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
request
for
the
probation
officer
was
such
an
invocation.
we
submit
that
it
was
not.
we
submit
that
the
standard
with
respect
to
juveniles
should
be
voluntariness
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
a
standard
employed
by
the
trial
court
in
the
instant
case.
and
we
would
submit
the
matter
if
there
are
no
more
questions
from
the
bench.
thank
you.
