chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
new
jersey
against
portash.
mr.
stier,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
case
in
its
present
pasture,
in
your
view,
any
different
from
what
it
would
be,
if
he
had
not
made
this
engrave
but
had
taken
the
stand
testified
and
been
impeached
on
the
harris
rationale?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
say,
just
be
sure
i
have
it
clear,
that
in
the
bench
conference
when
this
subject
was
discussed,
the
judge
made
it
clear
that
he
would
not
make
anticipatory
rulings
but
would
require
them
to
submit
the
question
at
a
bench
conference,
when
and
if
he
took
the
stand.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up
for
that.
i
am
going
to
try
to
clarify
one
thing.
had
this
man
taken
the
stand
and
the
prosecutor
in
impeachment
confronted
him
with
his
grand
jury
statements
that
was
given
under
the
grant
of
immunity
and
no
other
impeachment,
what
would
have
been
the
court’s
ruling
in
your
view
if
you
care
to
speculate
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
what
he
said
in
the
grand
jury
under
the
immunity
grant,
not
some
of
the
things
he
said
at
some
other
time
under
oath.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
from
some
of
the
other
things
you
said
that
the
prosecution
happened
to
use
to
impeach
him
that
was
not
included
in
the
grand
jury
testimony.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
neither
the
prosecution
nor
the
court
has
any
obligation
to
the
defendant
to
tell
him
advance
how
the
ruling
is,
what
the
prosecution
is
going
to
do
and
how
the
court
is
going
to
rule
until
and
unless
he
takes
the
stand
and
he
is
confronted
with
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wilbert?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
mean
that
the
prosecutor
could
not
impeach
or
undertake
to
impeach
by
use
of
the
statements
other
than
those
in
the
grand
jury,
if
he
had
independent
contradictory
statements?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
they
are
all
dependent
on
the
grants
of
immunity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
grant
of
immunity
relate
only
to
the
testimony
given
in
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
a
new
jersey
law
on
that
it
is
different
from
all
the
other
49
states
and
the
federal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
he
happened
to
be
presides
among
besides
the
other
things
he
did,
suppose
he
happened
to
be
an
alcoholic
and
went
to
alcoholic
synonymous
and
got
up
and
made
a
lot
of
these
statements.
now,
could
he
be
impeached
on
the
basis
of
that
or
would
you
say
that,
that
was
also
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
there
are
actually
some
facts
now,
usually
people
are
intoxicated
today
at
meeting,
so
i
am
told
you
know,
he
is
there
not
intoxicated
or
anywhere
else,
the
chamber
of
commerce,
wherever
you
want
him
to
be
and
he
makes
these
statements,
you
mean
that
all
those
statements
are
protected
by
the
grant
of
immunity
from
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
supposing
they
answer
these
questions
in
the
–
to
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
that
was
compelled?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
he
refused
to
come
there,
was
there
any
process
or
any
contempt
part
that
would
force
him
to
come?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
so
telling
us
that
when
he
went
to
the
prosecutor’s
office
in
response
to
an
invitation
and
answered
questions
under
oath
that
he
was
compelled
to
do
that
by
something?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
read
it
to
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
will
also
go
beyond
that
and
say
that
the
--
not
only
is
the
grand
jury
testimony
immunized
but
everything
you
said
after
that,
so
that
everything
is
immunized.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
the
statements
made
long
after,
substantially
after
the
grand
jury,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
was
it
or
was
not
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
kastigar
deal
with
testimony
given
outside
the
grand
jury
room,
after
the
grand
jury
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statements
that
he
gives
before
the
grand
jury
under
immunity,
i
would
submit,
can
not
be,
because
they
are
compelled.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
recall
the
case
but
it
may
be
us
versus
knox,
it
says
that
statements
made
by
a
gambler
on
his
income
tax
prior
to
any
request
for
immunity
could
be
utilized
against
him,
i
believe
that,
that
is
the
case.
i
know
that,
that
is
the
rule
of
law
that
your
honors
have
imposed;
i
do
not
recall
a
particular
case.
i
submit
there
was
absolutely
no
waiver
in
this
case,
so
his
right
to
testify.
he
was
faced
with
the
choice
of
paying
the
price,
either
testify
and
be
a
subject
to
the
improper
use
of
the
grand
jury
testimony,
the
immunized
grand
jury
testimony,
or
do
not
take
the
stand
at
all.
i
think
brooks
versus
tennessee
is
navigates
on
that
point
and
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall’s
opinion
in
wardius
versus
oregon
is
the
same,
he
had
a
right
to
rely
on
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1’o
clock
counsel.
you
may
resume
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.

am
not
sure

follow
you.
your
client

down

a
little
tête-à-tête,
he
did
not
have

did
he?
chief

chief

warren
e.

he?
chief
justice
warren

any
force
in
that
order,
after
he
had
given
the
testimony
to
the
grand
jury,
which
compelled
him
to
go
and
talk
to
the
prosecutor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
