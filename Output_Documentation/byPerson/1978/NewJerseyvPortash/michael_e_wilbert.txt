mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
the
respondent
did
go
before
the
grand
jury
after
advising
the
prosecutor
that
he
wished
to
have
his
fifth
amendment
rights
protected.
it
was
only
at
that
time
after
insisting
on
his
fifth
amendment
protection
and
privilege
that
he
was
offered
the
grant
of
immunity
under
the
new
jersey
public
employees
immunity
statute.
so
the
willingness
was
compelled,
it
was
not
him
coming
forward
in
volunteering
and
saying,
oh,
by
the
way
do
i
also
have
immunity.
he
refused
to
testify,
sought
and
obtained
immunity
from
the
court
and
the
language
of
the
immunity
grand
is
explicit
as
said
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
luciani
(ph)
also
advising
him
that
you
know
that
what
we
obtain
here
today
will
not
be
used
against
you
personally
in
any
subsequent
criminal
proceeding.
there
after
and
as
a
direct
result
of
the
immunity
that
he
obtained.
he
gave
grand
jury
testimony
and
he
also
gave
other
statements
to
the
prosecutor.
i
submit
that
all
of
that
testimony
that
he
gave
and
all
of
those
statements
are
obtained
by
the
state
as
a
direct
result
of
his
immunized
grand
jury
testimony
and
therefore
under
kastigar,
clearly
are
precluded
from
use
as
are
the
grand
jury
statements.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
if
he
had
independent,
i
submit
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
could
but
he
had
no
independent
statements.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
yes,
there
was
no
speaking
to
the
respondent
in
this
case
until
after
he
obtained
the
immunity.
it
was
only
at
that
time
that
he
was
willing
to
speak
to
them,
and
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
submit
that
it
does
not
mr.
justice.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
mr.
chief
justice,
i
submit
that
under
kastigar,
any
evidence
that
flows
directly
from
the
immunized
grand
jury
testimony
is
immunized
to
the
same
extend
as
the
immunized
testimony
itself,
and
i
think
that
under
kastigar
in
new
jersey
at
least
i
think
in
all
the
states,
an
independent
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
if
it
were
the
prosecutors
who
caused
him
to
be
intoxicated
and
took
him
to
the
alcoholic
synonymous
meeting,
i
think
that
there
is
no
question.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
no,
i
think
the
state
could
make
an
argument
and
possibly
make
a
showing
that
it
was
independent
and
if
they
carried
their
burden
in
a
kastigar
hearing
that
it
was
independently
obtained,
not
through
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
the
defendant,
then
they
could
use
that,
they
can
use
that
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
any
event.
however,
the
situation
here
was
that
after
they
took
his
grand
jury
testimony,
they
then
called
him
back
in
on
february
5th,
1975
as
the
date
is
quoted,
called
him
back
in
and
took
another
statement
under
oath
from
him
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
that
they
obtained
from
him
in
the
prior
grand
jury
proceedings.
they
had
none
of
this
information
but
they
examined
him
on
prior
that
time.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
what
compelled
him
was
that,
he
felt
that
he
had
the
same
immunity
that
flowed
from
the
prior
grand
jury
testimony
that
he
gave.
he
was
advised
that
he
would
not
be
indicted
if
he
gave
grand
jury
testimony
and
then
he
did
give
the
grand
jury
testimony
and
he
gave
the
subsequent
statement
that
they
called
for,
they
called
him
into
freehold,
new
jersey,
courthouse
and
with
a
court
reporter
and
asked
him
to
sit
down
and
under
oath
give
them
further
information
that
they
did
not
have.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
submit
that
is
compelled
just
as
though
he
would
still
in
the
grand
jury.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
think
the
state
would
have
immediately
called
him
before
the
grand
jury
and
said,
you
have
already
given
testimony
under
immunity,
you
now
required
to
continue
that
testimony.
they
called
him
back
twice
to
the
grand
jury.
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
any
limitation
on
the
number
of
times
they
call
him
them
back.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
submit
he
was
without
question
mr.
chief
justice.
after
he
had
given
testimony
under
oath,
he
had
given
testimony
in
november
and
then
in
february
was
called
back
to
give
further
testimony,
as
a
result
of
the
evidence
that
they
obtained
from
his
grand
jury
testimony.
it
flows
directly
under
kastigar.
i
submit
there
is
no
question
of
--
in
my
mind,
i
would
submit
that
it
can
not
be
a
question
as
to
it
direct
consequence
of
the
immunized
grand
jury
testimony.
the
defendant
then
--
the
respondent
then
had
telephone
calls
with
the
prosecutor,
when
they
called
him
and
other
information
was
obtained,
some
other
information
was
obtained.
he
then
was
indicted
and
he
went
to
trial.
at
the
end
of
the
state’s
case,
pardon
me,
prior
to
trial,
there
was
a
hearing
wherein
judge,
the
trail
judge
ruled
that
statements
given
under
the
grant
of
immunity
could
be
used
to
impeach
the
respondent,
if
he
was
materially
inconsistent
in
his
trail
testimony.
the
argument
made
by
the
attorney
general
that
court
never
made
a
rule,
it
think
it
is
fallacious.
at
page
151,
he
makes
a
ruling
in
the
appendix,
at
page
204,
he
make
a
ruling.
he
makes
all
of
these
preliminary
rulings
under
what
he
conceive
to
be
the
fact
situation
that
harris
applied
and
he
made
the
ruling
that
if
the
defendant
took
the
stand
in
his
own
defense,
he
could
be
impeached
by
immunized
testimony
for
inconsistencies.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
do
not
believe
that
i
do
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
i
believe
that
the
state
found
that
the
court
had
made
the
ruling.
the
state
of
new
jersey
found
that
the
court
had
ruled
that
the
testimony
could
be
used
to
impeach
that,
that
ruling
was
improper
and
that
the
state
statute
required
that
no
use
be
made
of
the
immunized
testimony
with
the
exception
of
perjury
and
false
swearing,
they
are
exceptions
that
are
built
into
the
statute
and
which
are
still
viable
to
the
state
in
the
event
he
testifies
the
subsequent
trial
without
the
use
of
impeachment.
he
can
be
charged
and
indicted
and
tried
for
perjury.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
think
that,
that
may
have
been
a
situation
that
violated
brooks
versus
tennessee.
your
court’s
ruling
in
brooks
versus
tennessee
was
that
the
defendant
who
was
required
to
take
the
stand
first
in
his
own
defense
or
not
at
all
was
placing
the
position
when
he
did
not
take
the
stand
that
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
was
violated,
not
that
he
took
the
stand.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
do
not
submit
that
i
do
in
this
particular
case,
because
i
believe
that
the
appellate
division
ruling
on
a
substantive
state
legislative
enactment
determine
that
no
use
could
be
made
of
the
testimony
in
the
manner
attempted
by
the
prosecutor
and
that
therefore
the
--
and
the
court
had
ruled
that
it
could
be
used
and
therefore
the
court
had
ruled
erroneously
and
had
violated
the
statute.
i
submit
that
we
can
be
on
completely
adequate
independent
state
grounds
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
think
that
they
were
drawing
the
distinction
that
your
honor
is
obtained
in
mincey
versus
arizona
just
this
past
term
in
june
that
we
are
talking
about
compulsion
when
we
are
talking
about
obtaining
testimony
under
immunity
and
in
talking
about
compulsion,
we
are
not
in
a
harris
situation.
the
judge
garth
in
us
versus
romento
(ph)
as
i
have
outlined,
draws
the
distinction
between
harris
and
limits
and
indicates
how
the
court
has
limited
harris
to
situations
where
no
compulsion,
where
there
was
no
involuntariness.
subsequent
to
that
time,
the
court
has
found
in
mincey
versus
arizona
that
one
of
the
question
is
compelled.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
the
immunity
statute
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
the
privilege
statute.
it
was
strictly
a
public
employee
immunity
statute
that
they
had
under
determination
here
2a:81,
2:17.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
no,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
not
in
new
jersey,
there
is
one,
there
is
a
public
employee
immunity
statute
that
they
relied
upon
and
they
were
dressing
himself
that
issue
because
this
man
was
a
mayor
and
freehold
director
at
that
time.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
that
is
the
immunity
statute
for
public
employees,
which
he
fit
that
category
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
think
they
were
drawing
an
analogy
and
construction
of
their
statute
and
they
were
utilizing
the
law
that
they
had
available
to
them.
hockenberry
was
available
at
that
time
and
hockenberry
drew
the
distinction
in
harris.
the
trial
court
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
yes
mr.
justice
white.
what
is
relied
upon
by
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey
is
the
common
law
of
and
i
believe
it
is
called
the
general
clause
of
(voice
overlap)
of
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
no,
there
is
not
a
statutory
act,
but
there
is
the
general
proceedings
of
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
am
not
familiar
with
that.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
that
may
have
been
a
witness
immunity
statute
to
general
witness
immunity
statute
under
2a:173
in
new
jersey.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
there
is
a
privilege
not
to
testify
but
it
is
found
from
the
new
jersey
constitution
of
the
general
provision
under
18
according
to
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
now,
it
is
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
yes,
it
is
constitutional
under
the
general
provisions
of
the
constitution,
there
is
no
specific
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
still
a
1947
constitution.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
there
was
no
privilege
specifically
stated
in
that.
it
is
now
been
interpreted
to
be
as
part
of
the
general
language
of
the
constitution
under
1a.
yes,
mr.
justice
pashman’s
dissent
in
miller
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
the
point
was
not
in
the
majority.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
there
is
not
a
majority
case
that
i
know
of
but
the
dissent
was
not
dissented
to
on
that
basis.
he
states
it
and
i
believe
that
is
what
is
found.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
do
not
know
that
we
need
to
reach
that
aspect
of
it
because
we
did
have
a
valid
public
employees
immunity
statute
that
was
not
self
executing
in
this
case.
he
asked
for
the
immunity,
he
obtained
the
immunity.
it
is
now
not
self
executing,
excuse
me,
it
was
self
executing
then
but
he
sought
and
obtained
immunity
under
that
statute.
the
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
appellate
division
was
that
the
court
had
ruled
and
in
ruling
had
violated
that
statute
and
that
a
retrial
–
a
remand
for
a
retrial
should
be
had.
the
state
in
its
brief
totally
misconstrues
the
state
appellate
division
rule.
the
ruling
was
not
that
the
testimony
could
not
be
use
the
subsequent
perjury
charge.
the
ruling
as
a
matter
of
fact,
states
at
page
207
of
that
opinion
that
is
not
here
pertinent,
because
there
was
no
allegation
of
perjury,
but
i
am
quite
certain
there
was
extensive
oral
argument.
i
have
attended
oral
argument
on
this
new
appellate
division.
could
we
say
that
you
could
not
use
it
even
for
a
perjury
charge,
no
one
was
conceded
that
at
a
subsequent
trial
for
perjury,
the
testimony
could
be
used
because
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
my
first
request
was
that
the
court
because
i
was
alluded
to
this
by
the
prosecutor
raising
it
initially
that
they
were
going
to
use
the
immunized
testimony
to
impeach,
i
asked
that
the
court
rule
that
they
could
not
use
the
immunized
testimony
to
impeach.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
did
not
actually
articulate
that,
what
i
was
attempting
to
do
was
say
that
the
immunity
statute
could
not
be
used
to
impeach.
what
it
was
construed
to
be
that
i
was
trying
to
limit
this
direct
--
the
scope
of
direct
and
also
then
limit
the
scope
of
cross;
i
did
not
attempt
to
do
that.
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
--
and
i
submit
that
the
united
states
has
the
same
situation
under
raffel
and
under
the
numerous
cases,
the
johnson
case,
that
once
you
take
the
stand
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
absolutely,
and
i
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
everything
is
flows
directly
from
that
grand
jury
testimony
is
as
immunized
under
kastigar.
i
think
to
have
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
co-extensive
as
kastigar
indicates
it
must
be,
as
mr.
justice
powell
indicated
in
his
decision,
there
can
be
no
use
made
of
that
immunized
testimony.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
the
test
i
do
not
believe
is
the
distance
between
–
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
pardon
me
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
do
not
believe
it
did,
but
kastigar
rule
that
any
evidence
that
flow
directly
or
indirectly
from
that
grand
jury
testimony
was
immunized.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
at
the
grand
jury
or
prior?
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
before
the
grand
jury
meaning
prior
to
it,
i
would
say
that,
that
testimony
is
not
immunized
and
it
could
be
used.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
yes
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
state
did
use
the
testimony
of
a
witness
in
constance
called
pinsky
(ph)
whose
testimony
they
had
obtained
prior
to,
they
had
obtained
it
after
the
respondent
took
the
stand
under
immunity,
but
they
had
the
information
that
he
was
going
to
testify
to
beforehand.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
there
was
no
statement
of
this
respondent.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
if
there
had
been,
i
believe
that
it
would
not
be
immunized
because
he
has
to
seek
immunity
and
obtain
the
immunity
for
his
fifth
amendment
rights
to
flow.
if
he
goes
and
testifies
of
his
own
will,
i
think
that
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
there.
i
think
the
court
has
found
that.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
the
policy
that
the
petitioner
urges
in
this
case
will
in
effect
lead
to
a
civil
deposition
discover
procedure,
not
withstanding
his
oral
argument,
because
the
prosecutor
then
will
in
his
discussion
be
able
to
gather
the
facts
of
his
case.
and
after
having
gathered
the
facts
of
his
case,
will
be
able
to
place
a
defendant
in
a
situation
where
he
has
to
obtain
immunity.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
he
did,
under
the
public
employees
immunity
statute.
if
he
did
not
go,
he
was
subject
to
the
penalties
of
forfeiture
of
public
office
and
possible
incarceration
for
his
contempt
and
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
for
contempt
of
the
court
because
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
yes,
there
was
mr.
chief
justice.
in
new
jersey,
the
procedure
is
that
he
was
taken
before
judge
schack
in
trenton
and
was
advised
that
he
–
they
sought
his
testimony
of
the
public
employees
immunity
statute
and
it
was
obtained
through
that
court
order.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
going
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
he
made
no
statement
whatsoever.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
only
the
previous
order
of
the
court
that
he
had
to
give
testimony
and
that
he
had
immunity
from
the
testimony
that
he
gave
that
was
still
in
effect.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
he
did.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
submit
that
it
was
a
continuing
order.
it
would
have
been
no
problem
whatsoever
for
the
prosecutor
if
he
refused
in
february
to
go
back
and
say
he
is
now
not
cooperating
with
us
and
not
giving
us
further
testimony,
so
that
the
civil
deposition
procedure
could
be
used.
in
the
prosecutor’s
discretion
after
he
gains
the
facts
of
his
case
and
place
the
defendant
in
a
position
of
immunity
and
then
compelled
him
to
testify
to
use
that
testimony
to
impeach
his
creditability.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
it
is
the
constitutional
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
well,
i
believe
that
also
there
is
a
due
process
are
again
to
be
made
because
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
was
under
the
impression
that
it
was
subsumed.
once
the
testimony
was
found
to
be
compelled
that
there
was
no
question
and
there
was
a
due
process
argument.
i
am
referring
to
mincey
versus
arizona,
where
the
question
is
if
it
is
compelled
testimony,
it
violates
due
process
to
use
it
in
any
regard
against
the
defendant,
whether
to
impeach
his
creditability
or
not
in
the
trial,
carving
out
the
exception
that
the
public
employees
immunity
statute
has
carved
out,
that
it
can
be
used
in
a
subsequent
perjury
charge
but
i
submit
that
it
is
a
due
process
question
also
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
there
was
not
a
due
process
argument
submitted
to
the
new
jersey
court,
no
justice
white.
the
mischief
that
the
prosecutor
attempts
to
impose
upon
the
court
though
with
regard
to
the
fifth
amendment
will
serve
no
constructive
purpose
to
prosecutors
in
general,
because
the
defendant
with
the
choice
of
either
having
the
immunity
granted,
knowing
it
can
be
used
to
impeach
his
creditability
if
your
honor
so
find,
i
submit
in
many
instances
will
opt
the
ladder
and
will
not
testify
preserving
his
rights
at
trial
to
take
the
stand
free
from
the
use
of
impeached
testimony.
and
as
mr.
justice
white
said
in
murphy
versus
waterfront
commission,
for
a
100
years
immunity
statutes
have
been
used
to
fared
out
crime
that
is
otherwise
impractical
of
discovery,
conspiracy
and
various
forms
of
racketeering.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
think
that
would
be
strictly
straight
interpretation
of
a
state
statute.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
submit
it
would
not.
i
do
not
think
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
--
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
federal
question,
if
we
merely
limit
this
to
the
construction
of
a
state
statute.
the
state
has
the
right
to
interpret
its
statute
under
substantive
interpretation
of
its
own
legislation.
there
was
by
the
way
mr.
justice
white
an
oral
agreement
made
in
this
case
mr.
luciani
(ph)
indicating
that,
you
understand
mr.
respondent
that
none
of
this
testimony
will
be
used
against
you
personally.
it
was
implied
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
it
was
no
different
from
the
statue.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
except
for
the
use
the
word
personally,
but
it
did
comply
with
the
public
employees
immunity
statue,
that
no
use
to
be
made.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
testimony
was
compelled
in
this
case
under
the
grant
of
immunity
and
once
compelled
that
cannot
be
used
for
any
purpose
and
except
for
the
perjury
recharge,
a
subsequent
perjury
recharge,
that
is
all
that
we
are
asking
that
compelled
testimony
not
be
used
to
impeach
its
credibility.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
yes
he
could.
the
appellate
division
made
that
clear
in
oral
argument
that
they
were
reserving
the
right
to
–
and
under
the
statute,
it
is
clear.
the
statute
says
could
not
be
used
in
any
subsequent
trial
against
the
defendant
with
the
exception
of
perjury
or
false
swearing.
at
the
time
of
this
statute,
it
was
merely
perjury,
but
they
have
changed
the
statute
to
make
it
non-self
executing
and
include
false
swearing.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
i
submit
--
the
appellate
division
found
that
they
could
be
used
in
carving
out
those
exceptions
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
that
is
not
my
contention;
i
submit
that
he
is
exposed
to
a
charge
of
perjury,
if
he
testifies
and
testifies
untruthfully
at
trial
the,
statute
prohibits
the
charge
of
perjury
and
allows
the
statement
made
at
the
grand
jury
to
belay
side
by
side
with
his
testimonial
trial.
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
that
was
not
my
position
mr.
justice
white.
i
believe
that
the
statute
is
brought
enough
new
jersey
under
the
statutory
interpretation
to
charge
him
with
perjury
in
a
subsequent
trial
and
to
utilize
the
statements
that
he
gave
against
him
to
show
the
perjury
to
a
jury.
that
is
really
the
problem
we
have
here.
it
does
not
amount
to
perjury,
his
testimony
--
mr.
michael
e.
wilbert
that
is
the
real
problem
in
this
case
because
there
was
no
contention
that
he
had
perjured
himself
at
the
grand
jury.
he
was
conceded
that
his
testimony
was
trustworthy
and
truthful.
and
i
submit
the
use
of
the
testimony
at
the
trial
was
not
going
to
go
to
perjury
but
was
merely
going
to
go
to
the
vagaries
of
memory
between
the
time
elapsed
and
other
inconsistencies
that
might
in
the
jury’s
mind
indicate
that
this
man
was
being
less
than
credible
without
even
reaching
the
question
of
perjury
they
were
attempting
to
use
it
and
that
is
the
real
problem
that
we
have
in
the
case.
they
were
violating
his
rights
to
take
the
stand
to
use
to
impeach
without
even,
i
contend,
hoping
to
obtain
perjury.
i
have
no
other
points
unless
there
are
any
other
questions.
