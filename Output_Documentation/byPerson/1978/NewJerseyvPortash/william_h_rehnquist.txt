justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
new
jersey
courts,
the
appellate
division
here
said,
it
was
wrong
for
the
trial
judge
to
refuse
to
make
this
kind
of
general
ruling,
and
refuse
follow
the
question
by
question
approach
that
you
say
new
jersey
law
requires,
would
we
then
have
a
federal
question
before
us?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
just
two
years
ago
in
oregon
v.
mathiason,
we
held
that
testimony
given
in
a
police
station
by
someone
who
is
not
under
arrest
did
not
violate
miranda.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
that
--
how
can
that
be
reconciled
with
the
statement
you
just
made?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
you
are
telling
about
rubber
hoses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
not
you
have
to
argue
here
that
kind
of
a
dry
run
of
that
sort
is
a
federal
constitutional
right
that
attaches
along
with
the
miranda
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
the
state
court
had
simply
said,
we
are
not
going
have
any
in
limine
motions
in
this
case,
if
you
want
to
test
my
ruling,
you
get
on
the
stand
and
start
answering
questions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
do
have
to
say
that
a
defendant
in
make
it
before
he
make
his
choice
as
to
whether
take
the
stand
or
not,
is
entitled
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
to
obtain
from
the
judge
some
sort
of
ruling
as
to
whether
particular
objections
made
to
particular
question
will
be
sustained
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
the
appellate
division
spent
so
much
time
on
harris
against
new
york?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
testimony
that
had
been
given
before
the
grand
jury
testimony,
statements
made
in
outside
a
court
context?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
prior.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
could
be
used
by
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
statement
of
the
defendant
made
prior
to
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
what
if
there
had
been?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
has
made
statements
before
ever
going
before
a
grand
jury,
then
goes
before
a
grand
jury
and
claims
immunity
does
not
mean
that
the
statements
he
made
prior
to
going
before
the
grand
jury
can
not
be
used
against
him
if
he
chooses
to
take
the
stand.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
the
statements
made
before,
i
mean
before
in
time,
prior
in
time?
