mr.
edwin
h.
stier
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
respondent
in
this
matter
was
entited
by
a
new
jersey
state
grand
jury
in
two
counts.
first
count;
for
misuse
of
his
public
offices
for
the
benefit
of
a
private
developer.
the
second
count;
for
obtaining
approximately
$31,000
from
that
developer
through
conduit
corp
to
which
he
was
not
entitled
as
a
public
official.
after
a
jury
trial,
the
respondent
was
convicted
on
count
two
and
acquitted
on
count
one.
matter
was
appealed
to
the
appellate
division
of
the
superior
court
of
new
jersey,
which
reversed
the
conviction
on
one
ground,
and
that
was
that
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
trial
court
had
ruled
in
such
a
way
as
to
deprive
the
respondent
of
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
thereby
causing
him
not
to
testify,
thereby
depriving
the
perjury
of
evidence
that
would
–
it
would
otherwise
have
received.
state
appealed
to
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
which
denied
the
state’s
appeal
and
denied
a
petition
for
certification.
the
two
issues
which
had
been
raised
before
this
court.
one
is
whether
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
was
properly
asserted
by
the
respondent
in
the
trial
and
the
second
was
whether
the
harris
case,
rationale
of
the
harris
case
was
properly
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case
by
the
appellate
division
of
the
superior
court
of
new
jersey.
the
issues
in
this
case
arise
out
of
a
series
of
in-camera
discussions,
which
took
place
among
counsel
on
the
court.
during
the
course
of
those
in-camera
discussions,
a
number
of
the
issues
were
discussed,
including
the
scope
of
cross-examination
of
the
respondent
in
the
event
that
the
respondent
would
testify
and
whether
the
state
would
be
permitted
to
use
any
of
the
respondent’s
pretrial
statements,
which
were
obtained
under
various
circumstances
over
an
extended
period
of
time
for
the
purpose
of
cross-examination
of
the
respondent.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
in-camera
discussions,
respondent’s
attorney
announced
that
in
reliance
on
what
he
believed
to
be
the
court’s
ruling,
his
client
was
not
going
to
testify.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
absolutely
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
oh,
yeah,
no,
there
would
be
a
significant
difference,
which
i
am
about
to
get
to.
that
difference
is
this.
during
the
course
of
the
in-camera
proceedings,
the
trial
court
on
at
least
14
separate
occasions
that
i
have
counted
in
going
through
the
record,
said
that
he
would
not
rule
generally
on
whether
the
state
could
use
or
under
what
circumstances
the
state
could
use
prior
statements
for
the
purpose
of
cross-examination.
the
court
indicated
that
he
was
bound
by
new
jersey
law
which
requires
the
rule
on
a
question
by
question
basis.
and
because
of
the
fact
that
no
specific
ruling
was
permitted
on
a
proffer
of
proof
by
the
state
for
cross-examination
purposes,
we
do
not
know
specifically
what
circumstances
would
have
been
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
no
your
honor,
there
was
a
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
your
honor,
there
was
a
procedure
that
was
established
by
the
court
and
agreed
to
by
the
prosecution
and
the
defense,
during
the
course
of
the
in-camera
discussions,
which
were
required
the
state
in
the
event
that
the
state
wanted
to
use
a
pretrial
statement
against
a
respondent
to
ask
for
a
sidebar
conference
before
the
question
was
asked
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
each
question
based
on
a
prior
statement.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
yes
your
honor,
it
is
in
the
appendix.
it
is
in
the
appendix
in
several
places
and
it
was
agreed
to
by
the
defense
really
on
in
the
discussions.
now,
that
specific
procedure
was
established
by
the
court
so
that
in
the
event
that
the
court
decided
that
the
questions
based
on
prior
statements
could
not
properly
be
used,
the
import
of
the
information
would
not
be
conveyed
to
the
jury.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
yes
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
in
order
to
receive
the
benefit
of
the
fifth
amendment
protection,
the
respondent
is
required
to
assert
the
fifth
amendment.
our
position
is
that
in
this
case,
he
did
not
assert
the
fifth
amendment,
because
he
did
not
take
the
stand
under
the
procedure
that
it
had
been
established
by
the
trail
court
for
his
protection,
permit
the
issue
to
be
framed
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
be
resolved
on
a
constitutional
basis.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
i
think
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
federal
question
because
of
the
fact
that
the
state
court’s
ruling
would
have
been
based
on
state
court
procedure,
but
on
the
other
hand
in
this
case,
there
was
no
discussion
of
state
court
procedure.
this
case
was
decided
by
the
appellate
division
squarely
on
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
that
is
correct
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
trial
court
when
the
respondent’s
attorney
announced
that
his
client
was
not
going
to
take
the
stand
expressed
surprise
at
that
conclusion,
and
indicated
that
the
respondent
had
made
a
tactical
judgment,
not
in
reliance
on
his
rulings
with
respect
to
the
use
of
prior
statements,
but
a
tactical
judgment
not
to
testify
and
was
simply
using
this
as
an
excuse
to
surround
his
tactical
judgment
with
some
constitutional
implications.
in
the
course
of
the
in-camera
discussions,
the
issue
that
was
faced
and
resolved
squarely
by
the
court
was
the
scope
of
permissible
cross-examination
of
the
defendant.
that
is
the
defendant
argued
that
the
scope
of
cross-examination
should
be
narrowed
to
the
scope
of
direct
examination
intended
to
use
only
a
very
narrow
area
on
cross-examination
and
asked
the
court
to
restrict
the
prosecution
in
his
cross-examination
only
to
those
factual
issues
raised.
the
prosecution
objected
very
strongly
to
that
and
took
the
position
that
the
scope
of
cross-examination
should
be
as
broad
as
all
of
the
evidence
which
it
had
put
it
in
its
case
in
chief,
none
of
which
by
the
way
have
been
alleged
by
the
respondent
to
have
resulted
from
tainted
statements.
there
is
no
element
in
this
case
concerning
the
way
in
which
the
prosecution
had
acquired
all
of
the
evidence
which
it
had
put
it
in
its
case
in
chief.
the
trial
court
ruled
then
that
the
prosecution
would
be
permitted
to
broaden
its
cross-examination
to
the
scope
of
its
evidence
which
it
had
been
put
it
in
its
case
in
chief,
its
testimonial
and
documentary
evidence
and
that
in
the
event
that
further
cross-examination
were
requested
by
the
state
in
which
any
of
the
respondent’s
prior
statements
would
be
used,
the
government
--
the
prosecution
then
would
have
to
approach
the
bench
and
raise
the
question
at
that
time
with
the
court.
it
was
after
the
ruling
on
the
scope
of
cross-examination
that
the
respondent
indicated
that
he
was
not
going
to
testify.
and
at
that
point,
the
court
expressed
surprises
i
indicated
before
and
indicated
that
in
effect
the
respondent
had
made
a
tactical
judgment.
had
he
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
trial
court’s
decision
on
the
scope
of
cross-examination
was
based
on
new
jersey
case
law,
which
makes
it
clear
that
when
a
defendant
takes
the
stand,
he
takes
the
stand
as
any
other
witness
and
subjects.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
no
your
honor,
the
position
of
the
state
is
that
the
evidence
that
was
obtained
to
put
in,
in
the
case
in
chief
and
the
respondent
never
disputed
that
was
all
based
on
independent
sources
and
it
was
that
evidence,
that
the
prosecution
intended
to
use
for
purpose
of
cross-examination
within
the
scope
that
the
court
permits.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
it
is
conceivable
that,
that
might
have
occurred.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
alright,
i
think
that
his
evidence
that
was
clearly
outside
the
scope
of
his
prior
statements,
which
may
have
been
outside
of
the
scope
of
direct
examination,
which
the
prosecution
would
want
to
use
for
purposes
of
cross-examination.
had
the
respondent
testified
and
had
the
prosecutor
approached
the
bench
with
a
specific
piece
of
prior
statement
that
it
intended
to
use
for
cross-examination,
we
would
know
the
answer
to
your
question
your
honor.
we
would
know
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
now,
that
may
have
been
a
factor,
that
may
have
been
a
factor.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
it
is
possible,
and
the
defendant
hypothesized
situation
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
oh,
that
is
true
your
honor.
i
did
not
mean
to
indicate
that
there
was
nothing
in
his
grand
jury
testimony
that
was
not
relevant
to
the
case
in
chief.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
yes,
that
is
precisely
the
state’s
position.
we
do
not
know
which
statements
if
any,
the
state
might
have
intended
to
use,
we
do
not
know
whether
the
state
would
have
taken
the
position
that
it
would
concede
the
truthfulness
of
the
prior
statement
or
a
claim
that
it
was
false,
we
do
not
know
what
purpose
the
state
would
offer
the
statement
for,
we
do
not
know
whether
the
statement
would
have
been
claimed
by
the
state
to
have
been
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
grant
of
immunity,
we
do
not
know
whether
there
would
have
been
a
direct
contradiction
between
what
he
had
said
previously
and
what
he
was
testifying
to
a
trial.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
case
your
honor.
there
even
if
the
law
is
as
the
new
jersey
appellate
division
applied,
there
are
still
possible
circumstances
that
could
have
occurred
at
the
trial
which
was
fallen
clearly
outside
of
the
hockenberry
case,
which
is
the
case
on
which
the
appellate
division
relied.
for
example,
if
the
particular
piece
of
statement
that
the
prosecution
intended
to
offer
could
have
been
demonstrated
to
be
false
or
could
have
been
demonstrated
to
have
fallen
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
grant
of
immunity,
then
it
would
have
fallen
outside
of
the
hockenberry
case
and
outside
of
the
law
as
the
appellate
division
applied
it.
we
do
not
know
that
because
we
do
not
know
specifically
what
purpose
the
state
might
have
offered
it
for
or
what
the
circumstances
would
be
surrounding
in
the
obtaining
of
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
if
his
representations
are
correct,
then
he
might
have
gotten
on
the
stand
to
testify,
had
the
ruling
been
as
broad
as
the
appellate
division
conceived,
however
he
still
might
have
been
faced,
even
under
martin
berry
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
yes
because
there
are
situations
in
which
i
would
argue,
we
are
not
bound
by
the
hockenberry
decision,
we
are
not
bound
by
its
scope.
i
think
it
is
important
for
me
to
take
a
moment
to
discuss
the
circumstances
under
which
the
statements
were
obtained
from
the
respondent.
respondent
provided
information
on
basically
three
occasions,
twice
in
the
state
grand
jury
and
once
in
a
statement
under
oath
outside
of
the
grand
jury
several
months
later.
during
the
first
appearance
in
the
grand
jury,
the
purpose
for
his
testimony
was
simply
to
identify
certain
records
which
we
are
not
covered
by
the
fifth
amendment.
there
had
been
a
hearing
by
the
trial
court
prior
to
his
first
appearance
and
he
was
ordered
to
produce
certain
records
before
the
grand
jury
and
to
simply
identify
what
those
record
were.
he
appeared
shortly
after
that
time
in
the
state
grand
jury,
under
the
protection
of
the
state’s
public
official
immunity
law,
which
is
a
self-executing
was
at
that
time,
a
self-executing
use
plus
derivative
use
immunity
statue
which
covered
public
officials’
testifying
about
conduct
in
their
public
offices.
several
months
later,
as
the
result
of
a
series
of
discussions
between
counsel
representing
the
respondent
at
that
time
and
the
prosecution,
a
statement
was
taken
from
the
respondent
under
oath
outside
of
the
grand
jury
for
the
purpose
of
defining
the
testimony
that
was
required
for
a
case
in
which
it
was
contemplated
that
the
respondent
would
ultimately
be
a
witness.
it
was
a
related
case,
it
was
an
indictment
that
was
about
to
be
returned
concerning
the
individuals
who
operated
the
development
company
and
the
conduit
corporation
through
which
the
respondent
had
received
the
approximately
$
31,000.
ultimately
that
indictment
was
returned.
it
is
interesting
and
i
think
instructive
to
look
at
the
change
of
position,
which
the
respondent
has
taken
between
the
beginning
of
the
trial
and
this
point.
his
original
argument
prior
to
going
the
trial
was
that
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed
because
he
in
effect
had
made
a
deal
with
the
state
in
return
for
his
cooperation.
he
believed
that
the
state
had
entered
into
a
contract
which
should
have
barred
the
state
from
retuning
an
indictment.
although
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
his
cooperation,
his
testimony
in
the
grand
jury
was
the
result
of
a
desire
to
strike
a
bargain
with
the
state.
the
trial
court
at
that
time
found
that
no
such
contract
had
been
entered
into
and
held
that
the
indictment
should
not
be
dismissed.
but
it
is
clear
that
in
his
case,
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
defendant
who
has
been
brought
into
a
grand
jury
asserting
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
refusing
to
testify,
there
is
more
of
a
willingness
demonstrated
on
the
part
of
this
respondent
to
supply
information,
although
he
asked
for
and
received
immunity
protection,
but
a
willingness
to
disclose
that
information
because
that
disclosure
was
to
be
in
his
best
interests
in
disposing
ultimately
of
the
criminal
charges
that
faced
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
yes
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
i
am
about
to.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
i
am
about
to.
the
appellate
division
of
the
superior
court
has
relied
on
what
is
probably
the
leading
authority
in
the
circuits
on
this
question
that
is
us
versus
hockenberry,
474
f.2d.
there
had
been
only
very
few
cases
decided
on
this
question.
hockenberry
has
been
relied
on
in
each
of
those
cases.
hockenberry,
the
state
contends,
is
wrong
in
one
respect
and
certainly
distinguishable
in
another
significant
respect.
i
realize
that
the
hockenberry
case
has
only
limited
presidential
value
here,
but
i
think
that
the
distinction
between
the
facts
of
the
hockenberry
case
and
this
case
are
extremely
important,
and
i
want
to
take
one
moment
to
address
that.
in
the
hockenberry
case,
the
defendant
had
been
subpoenant
to
a
grand
jury
and
had
testified
truthfully
about
having
perjured
himself
previously
and
testified
forcedly
in
another
respect
unrelated
to
the
first.
he
was
entited
for
the
perjury
at
his
trial
when
he
testified,
the
prosecution
used
his
truthful
testimony
indicating
that
he
had
previously
committed
perjury
for
the
purpose
of
impeaching
his
credibility.
clearly
the
purpose
was
not
to
demonstrate
a
conflict
between
his
trial
testimony
and
his
grand
jury
testimony,
the
purpose
was
to
permit
the
jury
to
infer
from
the
truth
of
what
he
had
said
in
the
grand
jury,
having
admitted
committing
perjury
previously,
to
infer
from
the
truth
of
what
he
said
that
he
was
an
habitual
liar,
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
no
matter
how
you
construe
the
decision
made
by
the
trial
court
in
this
case,
it
was
clearly
not
so
broad
as
to
permit
the
jury
to
infer
from
the
truth
of
what
would
have
been
offered
from
his
prior
statements,
any
facts,
but
simply
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
an
inconsistency
between
what
he
had
said
previously
under
oath
and
what
he
was
saying
now.
most
importantly
though,
i
think
that
the
hockenberry
case
and
the
appellate
division
of
this
case
misconstrued
the
import
of
the
harris
case.
it
had
to
distinguish
harris
versus
new
york
in
order
to
get
around
the
implications
of
that
case.
the
harris
case
of
course
dealt
with
a
miranda
situation;
a
statement
obtained
in
violation
of
the
miranda
rules.
in
the
appellate
division
and
in
hockenberry,
the
court
described
a
miranda
confession
as
a
voluntary
confession
and
said
that
since
this
was
an
immunity
situation,
the
statement
was
taken
involuntarily.
i
dispute
that
characterization
of
miranda.
the
miranda
case
clearly
deals
with
statements
which
are
compelled
that
you
are
involuntarily
obtained.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
pardon.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
i
am
sorry,
i
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
term
voluntariness
has
been
used
in
different
contexts,
it
is
used
different
to
mean
different
terms.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
i
think
that
a
statement
taken
in
an
immunity
situation
is
no
more
involuntary,
the
statement
taken
in
violation
of
miranda.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
pardon,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
and
the
court
in
miranda
described
the
coercive
atmosphere
of
the
police
station
as
one
in
which
the
responses
were
compelled
and
described
the
statement
taken
under
those
circumstances
as
an
involuntary
statement
and
indeed
compared
the
compulsion
of
the
police
station
to
the
compulsion
of
a
court
proceeding.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
that
is
correct,
and
i
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
when
the
compelling
atmosphere
is
created
in
the
police
station,
which
forces
the
individual
in
those
circumstances
to
give
up
his
inclination
to
remain
silent,
that
is
the
threshold
which
i
believe
is
reached
in
a
grand
jury
when
immunity
is
granted
and
when
court
compulsion,
legal
compulsion
is
exhorted
to
force
the
witness
to
testify.
certainly
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
believe
there
would
be
a
less
compulsion
under
the
facts
of
this
case
than
in
circumstances
where
--
some
circumstances
in
the
back
room
of
a
police
station
where
the
compelling
atmosphere
can
be
very
coercive.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
no
your
honor,
that
raises
a
different
question.
those
are
the
due
process
cases
which
i
think
can
be
distinguished.
that
is
the
other
context
in
which
involuntary
is
used
where
the
conduct
of
the
police
itself
is
pulled
into
question,
where
the
policy
is
different.
the
policy
there
is
to
deter
unlawfulness
in
the
obtaining
of
a
confession.
that
element
is
not
present
in
a
grand
jury.
i
think
that
the
due
process
cases
can
be
distinguished
from
the
miranda
cases
and
that
the
immunity
is
more
closely
analogous
to
the
miranda
type
situation.
the
compulsion
in
the
back
room
of
a
police
station
where
it
is
my
contention,
defendant
should
receive
no
less
protection
than
a
witness
sitting
in
a
grad
jury.
i
am
not
here
to
urge
a
ruling
by
this
court,
which
would
permit
a
prosecutor
to
depose
a
potential
defendant;
that
is
not
the
case
here.
in
oregon
versus
hass,
the
court
when
faced
with
a
question
of
potential
abuse
said,
we
will
deal
with
that
problem
when
the
facts
of
the
case
indicate
an
abuse.
i
believe
it
can
and
could
be
dealt
with
under
the
due
process
clause,
but
the
due
process
clause
does
not
apply
here,
this
is
strictly
a
fifth
amendment
case.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
that
is
right,
no,
there
are
no
state
constitutional
guarantees.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
there
is
a
rule
of
evidence
which
creates
a
privilege
against
the
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
that
is
correct,
there
is
no
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
i
do
not
think
that,
that
is
what
the
appellate
division
said
your
honor,
i
think
the
appellate
division
rested
its
holding
squarely
on
the
fifth
amendment,
squarely
on
the
hockenberry
case
in
defining
the
permissible
limits
of
the
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
had
the
hockenberry
case
gone
the
other
way,
i
think
that
the
state
statue
would
have
been
construed
the
other
way
by
the
appellate
division
that
seems
to
be
clearly
what
the
appellate
division
is
saying
in
its
opinion
that
it
is
bound
by
the
scope
of
permissible
use
of
immunized
testimony
as
defined
by
the
hockenberry
case,
it
relies
strictly
on
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
i
do
not
believe
that
they
are
construing
the
state
statute
because
the
state
statute
has
been
held
in
a
number
of
new
jersey
cases
to
be
as
broad
as
the
federal
constitution
permits.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
that
case
was
--
that
was
decided
before
this
statute
was
enacted
in
response
to
this
court’s
holdings
in
the
cases
which
applied
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
states
and
which
have
restricted
the
state
in
using
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
yes
it
is
your
honor.
i
believe
that
it
is
different
in
the
sense
that
it
was
drawn
specifically
from
this
court’s
holdings,
which
were
decided
subsequently.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
yes
your
honor,
it
is
still
is
a
statute.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
no,
i
believe
that
it
might
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
i
think
you
would
still
had
the
same
issue
of
what
the
scope
of
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
going
to
be.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
if
he
then
confronted
strictly
with
the
--
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
my
argument
would
still
be
the
same
that
the
use
of
his
grand
jury
testimony
taken
under
a
grant
of
immunity
for
that
limited
purpose,
not
to
infer
the
truthfulness
of
what
he
said
in
the
grand
jury
but
simply
to
show
the
conflict
between
two
statements
under
oath
would
have
been
permissible
under
the
rationale
of
harris
and
not
precluded
by
the
scope
of
protection
afforded
by
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
absolutely,
i
think
the
record
is
clear
on
that
and
indicates
a
substantial
amount
of
information,
which
it
intended
to
use,
which
fell
outside
of
the
scope
of
his
grand
jury
statements
or
any
other
statements
that
he
gave.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
that
is
correct.
i
believe
that
a
procedure
that
was
established
by
the
trial
court
to
keep
this
information
away
from
the
jury
was
clear
and
is
all
that
the
defendant
was
entitled
to.
mr.
edwin
h.
stier
thank
you.
