justice

say
in
an
ordinary
criminal
case,
the
state
purports
to
call
the
defendant
to
the
stand
on
their
side
of
the
case,
they
just
want
to
cross-examine
the
defendant.
is
not
there
some
new
jersey
law
of
some
kind,
forgetting
federal
law,
is
not
there
a
new
jersey
--
is
not
there
at
least
a
statutory
provision
that
would
prevent
a
state
from
doing
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
no
general
--
there
no
new
jersey
statute
that
generally
grants
the
privilege
not
to
testify
against
yourself?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
position,
your
constitutional
position
is
made
solely
on
the
privilege
against
compelled
self
incrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
far
as
it
rests
on
the
constitutional
claim
that
is
â€“
it
is
just
fifth
amendment,
the
fifth
and
fourth
amendments?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
ever
make
that
to
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
is
no
due
process,
was
there
a
due
process
argument
submitted
to
the
new
jersey
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
new
jersey
statute
though
had
immunity
statute,
the
public
employees
immunity
statute
had
promised
the
defendant
not
to
use
the
compelled
statements
or
the
statements
that
his
testimony,
in
circumstances
in
which
the
--
against
which
the
fifth
amendment,
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
did
not
protect
the
defendant,
suppose
that
new
jersey
had
gone
farther
than
it
was
constitutionally
required
to
do
and
then
at
trial
it
purported
to
violate
its
agreement
or
its
promise,
would
that
be
a
federal
constitutional
issue
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
be
a
federal
constitutional
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
no
different
from
the
statue?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
almost
in
the
terms
of
the
statue.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
position
as
i
take
it
on
perjury
is
that,
if
he
had
taken
the
stand
that
the
trial
and
testify
and
he
was
either
convicted
or
acquitted
as
would
be
the
case,
his
statements
at
the
grand
jury
hearing,
his
previous
statements
could
not
be
used
to
convict
of
the
perjury
at
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
is
that
grand
jury
statements
could
not
be
used
to
convict
him
of
perjury
in
his
testimony
at
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
your
position
was
that
the
only
perjury
that
he
could
be
convicted
would
be
perjury
at
the
grand
jury
stage.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
sorry
i
just
do
not
understand
why
you
think
it
is
even
that
it
is
any
more
of
violation
of
the
statute
to
use
his
grand
jury
testimony
at
the
trial
to
show
that
he
is
lined,
if
a
day
later
in
a
perjury
prosecution
related
to
what
he
testified
to
a
trial,
you
could
introduce
his
prior
grand
jury
testimony.
