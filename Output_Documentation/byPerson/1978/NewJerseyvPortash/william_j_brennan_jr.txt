justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
mentioned
that
you
thought
the
court
of
the
appellate
division
rested
this
on
questions
of
the
construction
and
scope
of
the
what,
both
the
immunity
statute
and
the
privilege
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
is
not
there
are
separate
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
then
your
argument
is
that
this
whole
case
involves
only
a
construction
of
17.2a2,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
immunity
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
answer
my
brother
rehnquist’s
question,
why
so
much
attention
to
federal
cases
in
the
appellate
division?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
hockenberry
was
a
federal
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happen
to
the
statute
that
we
dealt
within
tillo
(ph)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
the
attorney
general
said,
that
has
been
succeeded
by
another
statute
that
independently
of
this
immunity
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
am
talking
about
the
–
it
is
25
years
ago
since
i
wrote
that
opinion
but
what
we
dealt
with
was
a
statutory
provision,
which
declared
a
privilege
against
self
incrimination,
a
general
privilege.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
that
the
privilege
is
now
constitutional
in
new
jersey?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
general
provision
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
constitution
any
different
now
than
it
was
when
i
sat
on
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
25
years
ago?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
there
was
no
privilege
in
that
constitution
that
is
why
we
have
to
deal
with
a
statutory
provision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
not
interested
in
the
dissent,
is
there
an
opinion
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
that
now
reads
a
privilege
into
the
new
jersey
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
is
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
know
mr.
justice
pashman
has
been
better
at
the
center
i
know
but
it
does
not
follow
that
does
it
that
his
colleagues
have
agreed
with
him?
