why
as
a
matter
of
construction
of
the
state
statutes,
does
that
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
which
i
guess,
i
wrote
when
i
was
on
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
i
thought
we
made
quite
a
point
that
the
state
statute
was
informed
primarily
not
by
constitutional
interpretations
but
by
common
law
interpretation
of
the
privilege,
is
not
that
case
still
a
law?
unknown
speaker
is
the
current
statute
very
different
from
the
one
dealt
within
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
still
a
statute?
