justice
potter
stewart
mr.
stier,
i
am
trying
to
think
through
whether
this
argument
you
are
making
is
a
question
of
state
procedure
or
a
federal
question,
are
you
–because
i
gather
the
state
supreme
court
considered
for
its
purposes
the
question
was
adequately
raised
to
address
the
merits
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
are
saying
that
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law,
a
state
may
not
permit
this
issue
to
be
raised
and
preserved
in
this
way
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
he
had
never
been
in
the
immunized
testimony
at
all
and
the
defendant
was
going
to
take
this,
it
was
anticipated
the
defendant
would
take
this
stand
and
then
the
prosecutor
made
this
motion
at
the
close
of
its
case
or
before
the
defendant
started
his
case.
what
is
the
rule
in
new
jersey?
there
is
no
such
restriction
on
cross-examination?
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
take
it
then
that
the
prosecutor
thought
that
by
asking
a
question
broader
than
the
defendant’s
direct,
he
could
perhaps
confirm
some
of
the
state’s
case
in
chief.
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
ask
him,
whether
or
not
a
certain
fact
is
true.
justice
potter
stewart
that
you
had
already
put
in
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
anticipated
that
if
he
did
not
–
that
apparently
the
reason
you
wanted
to
ask
that
was
that
there
must
been
something
in
his
grand
jury
testimony
that
gave
you
that
clue?
justice
potter
stewart
you
may
have
obtained
it
from
independent
sources,
but
there
might
be
something
in
the
grand
jury
testimony
that
would
be
relevant
to
or
confirm
one
or
more
facts
in
that
state’s
case
in
chief.
justice
potter
stewart
they
would
have
to
be
or
you
would
not
want
to
--
you
would
never
get
around
and
wanting
to
impeach
him
with
it.
justice
potter
stewart
your
position
must
be
then
that
the
existence
of
this
prior
testimony
could
not
possibly
have
or
just
did
not
exert
any
pressure
whatsoever
not
to
take
the
stand.
justice
potter
stewart
or
how
could
it
have
been
with
what
in
the
way
you
just
answered
me?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
asking
the
question
outside
the
scope
of
his
direct,
but
which
is
relevant
to
your
direct
case
and
you
want
to
confirm
part
of
your
direct
case
by
his
testimony.
say
he
answers
it
a
certain
way,
and
then
you
want
to
impeach
him
with
something
he
said
in
his
grand
jury
testimony.
that
has
to
mean
then
that
there
is
something
in
his
grand
jury
testimony
that
supports
your
case
in
chief.
justice
potter
stewart
not
only
relevant,
but
it
supports
your
case
in
chief.
justice
potter
stewart
but
mr.
stier,
if
the
view
of
the
law
that
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
expressed,
that
should
happen
to
be
correct,
there
would
not
be
any
purpose
in
all
these
preliminary
questions,
would
there?
in
other
words,
if
he
had
an
absolute
right
not
to
be
impeached,
to
be
free
of
the
impeachment
with
the
grand
jury
testimony,
there
would
not
have
been
any
need
for
this.
so
which
leads
me
to
ask
you,
in
order
to
raise
the
question
of
law
that
you
ultimately
are
going
to
get
to,
why
do
we
have
to
decide
and
why
do
we
have
to
bother
with
this
because
they
did
adequately
preserve
that
issue,
did
not
they?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
that
if
he
had
been
told
by
the
trial
judge
that,
well,
i
know
the
appellate
division
views
the
grand
jury
testimony
is
not
useable,
he
would
have
decided
to
get
on
the
witness
stand,
he
would
have
needed
all
that,
if
we
can
take
the
appellate,
what
they
represent
to
us
anyway.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
it
is
really
different.
supposing
we
had
not
granted
certiorari
in
this
case,
but
waited
for
the
next
case
and
there
is
a
second
trial
under
this
being
a
law
of
new
jersey,
would
you
still
say
as
a
matter
of
new
jersey
law,
you
have
to
get
through
all
that
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would?
justice
potter
stewart
but
nevertheless
on
that
when
he
was
opinioned
in
november
14th
1974,
the
immunity
was
certainly
made
express,
was
not
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
was
asked
if
he
understood
that
i
think?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
there
is
no
clarificaion
on
what
the
limits
of
the
immunity
were
or
what
the
extend
of
it
was
i
guess?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
take
it
you
are
going
to
get
to
–
justice
potter
stewart
why
you
have
not
exceeded
the
limits
of
your
promise?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
did
you
read
michigan
against
tucker?
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
read
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
michigan
against
tucker?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
one
thought
in
that
opinion
if
i
have
the,
i
think
i
have
the
indictment.
the
court
saying
specifically
that
violation
of
the
miranda
rules
interrogation
does
not
mean
that
the
response
to
the
interrogation
was
involuntary.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
was
not
it
pretty
clear
in
the
harris
case
itself
that
the
statement
was
not
an
involuntary
statement,
but
one
on
the
--
but
the
statement
simply
taken
in
violation
of
the
miranda,
so
called
miranda
rules?
justice
potter
stewart
witness
is
guilty
of
contempt
if
he
does
not
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
the
witness
is
guilty
of
contempt
if
he
does
not
answer,
is
not
he?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
that
is
generally
being
considered
involuntary
then.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
stier,
i
notice
that
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
division
refers
to
the
privilege
as
a
constitutional
protection
afforded
by
the
fifth
amendment
and
to
cognate
state
constitutional
guarantees.
we
do
not
have
any
constitutional
guarantee,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
statutory
entirely,
is
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
i
mean
it
is
not
--
we
do
not
have
any
privilege
in
the
state
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
only
statutory.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
of
your
respondent,
i
know
your
time
is
running,
your
respondent
argues
that
really
this
appalled
division
opinion
is
simply
a
matter
of
construction
of
the
state
statues,
the
immunity
statute
and
the
privilege
statute
and
therefore
that
the
--
even
though
it
draws
on
federal
cases
to
inform
or
like
interpretation
of
those
two
statues.
the
whole
decision
rest
on
the
state
statutes
and
therefore
on
adequate
state
ground
and
therefore
there
is
nothing
here
for
us
to
decide.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
gather
your
adversary's
argument
is
sure,
appellate
division
did
all
of
that,
but
only
to
inform
the
content
of
the
state
statutes,
and
what
all
we
have
here
is
an
interpretation
of
the
state
statutes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
stier,
suppose
in
granting
the
immunity,
the
state
had
said
that
we
will
not
use
anything
you
say
here
except
in
perjury
false
swearing
or
whatever
the
language
was,
and
we
just
want
to
know,
we
will
not
use
it
in
for
impeachment
or
for
cross-examination
in
any
subsequent
criminal
trial
of
you,
and
suppose
then
the
state
want
to
do
what
–
what
it
wants
to
do,
what
it
wanted
to
do
here,
would
that
violate
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
thanks
a
lot.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
he
did
in
immunity
statute
if
there
is
no
privilege
not
to
testify?
justice
potter
stewart
i
can
not
mr.
cheif
justice,
because
it
does
not
speak
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
original
motion
that
if
you
took,
that
if
your
client
took
the
stand
that
the
cross-examination
be
limited
to
the
subject
matter
of
his
own
statements.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
what
i
asked
you.
i
ask
that
the
cross-examination
be
limited
to
the
scope
of
the
direct
testimony
of
your
client
if
you
took
the
stand?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
then
your
position
is
that
if
you
had,
if
nothing
like
this
had
come
up
in
advance
and
your
client
had
taken
the
stand
and
he
testified
to
a
fact,
made
an
assertion,
your
position
would
be
that
the
state
could
not
then
resort
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
in
an
attempt
to
impeach
that
statement?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
reason
of
the
grant
of
certiorari
to
the
review
of
the
judgment
of
the
superior
court
of
new
jersey
appellate
division.
the
case
involves
the
scope
of
the
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
grounded
in
the
fifth
amendment
and
made
binding
against
the
states
by
the
fourteenth.
the
precise
question
is
whether
despite
this
constitutional
privilege,
a
prosecutor
may
use
a
person’s
immunized
grand
jury
testimony
to
impeach
that
person’s
credibility
as
a
testifying
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial.
the
new
jersey
appellate
court
held
that
the
grand
jury
testimony
could
not
be
use
for
that
purpose
and
reversed
the
criminal
conviction
of
the
respondent
for
a
new
trial.
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
new
jersey
court.
testimony
given
in
response
to
a
grant
of
a
legislative
immunity
is
the
essence
of
coerced
testimony.
the
witness
is
told
to
talk
or
face
the
government’s
coercive
sanctions,
notably
a
conviction
for
contempt.
the
information
given
and
response
to
a
grant
of
immunity
may
well
be
more
reliable
than
information
beaten
from
a
helpless
defendant
in
a
station
house,
but
it
is
no
less
compelled.
and
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
provide
a
privilege
against
compel
self-incrimination
not
merely
against
unreliable
self-incrimination.
we
thus
still
here
with
the
constitutional
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
in
its
most
pristine
form.
the
courts
are
not
free
therefore
in
a
case
like
this
to
engage
in
a
process
of
balancing
the
competitive
interests
involved.
any
such
balancing
was
performed
finally
and
forever
or
at
least
until
the
constitution
is
amended
by
our
forefathers.
for
these
reasons
more
fully
elaborated
in
the
written
opinion
filed
this
morning
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
new
jersey
court
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
powell
while
both
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
have
each
written
concurring
opinions
which
respectively
have
been
joined
by
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
justice
blackmun
on
the
other
hand
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined.
this
dissenting
opinion
i
should
add
does
not
reach
the
substantive
constitutional
question
decided
today.
