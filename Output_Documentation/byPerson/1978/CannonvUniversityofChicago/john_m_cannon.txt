mr.
john
m.
cannon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
as
a
matter
of
first
impression
the
issue
of
whether
title
ix
of
the
education
amendments
1972
maybe
enforced
in
a
federal
civil
action
the
particular
case
involves
in
the
application
to
medical
school
which
allegedly
was
denied
on
the
basis
of
sex.
title
ix
provides
impertinent
part
no
person
in
the
united
states
shall
on
the
basis
of
sex
be
excluded
from
any
education
program
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
at
bedrock,
this
case
asked
the
question
in
words
of
this
court
from
allen
versus
the
state
board
of
elections
whether
that
sweeping
promise
of
congress
is
to
be
merely
an
empty
promise.
the
current
operating
plan
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare's
office
for
civil
rights
contemplates
a
predicted
backlog
of
3570
civil
rights
complaints
including
889
which
includes
allegations
of
sex
discrimination.
title
ix
applies
to
approximately
97,000
institutions,
a
number
of
participants
according
to
hew
is
approximately
55
million.
as
of
september
30,
1976,
hew
had
asked
20,318
school
districts
and
colleges
to
file
compliance
statements.
by
the
following
march,
1977,
only
6742
had
done
so.
the
enforcement
task
is
enormous,
much
more
enormous
than
that
faced
by
the
attorney
general
with
respect
to
election
laws
and
considered
by
this
court
in
the
allen
case.
in
fact,
hew
has
declared
itself
it
has
no
hope
of
making
a
complete
enforcement
job
for
this
spread
of
concern.
now
hew
in
its
brief
to
me,
made
the
most
significant
point
of
any
other
briefs
including
our
own
and
that
is
that
congress
clearly
contemplated
that
voluntary
compliance
would
be
the
primary
means
for
enforcements
not
only
of
title
ix
but
of
its
predecessor
legislation
title
vi
subsequent
legislation
dealing
with
handicap
and
age
discrimination.
mr.
john
m.
cannon
yes,
i
--
two
things,
i
--
obviously,
there
was
some
confusion
between
the
district
5
office
in
chicago
and
the
national
office.
the
national
office
in
the
opinion
which
is
attached
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
has
long
maintained
the
position
and
particularly
with
respect
to
title
ix
since
september
of
1974
that
there
is
a
private
right
of
action
to
enforce
title
ix
whereas
the
district
office
went
into
the
federal
district
court
and
denied
the
existence
of
the
private
right
of
action
and
said
they
were
proceeding.
and
indeed
there
is
in
the
appendix
a
copy
of
my
correspondence
with
the
united
states
attorney
in
chicago
that
indicated
the
regional
director
plan
to
conduct
this
particular
investigation
during
the
first
half
of
january
1976.
mr.
john
m.
cannon
quite
frankly
your
honor,
the
carnegie
foundation
characterized
it
as
the
atomic
bomb
and
i
think
it's
perhaps
too
lethal
in
the
sense
that
we
referred
in
our
reply
brief
to
--
going
through
the
fund-cutoff
procedures
with
hew
as
playing
russian
roulette
with
an
institution.
too
many
of
our
wonderful
institutions
of
higher
learning
and
other
federally
assisted
organizations
are
dependent
for
anything
like
their
current
mode
of
operation
on
federal
funds.
putting
the
federal
funds
at
risk
is
one
thing
that
can
be
avoided
by
judicial
action
and
hew
pointed
that
out
in
the
--
mr.
john
m.
cannon
well,
in
considering
why
they
may
not
have
done
that,
i
would
point
out
that
legislating
in
that
particular
area
gets
very
touchy
particularly
with
the
background
being
title
vi.
and
consider
the
fact
that
this
court
probably
would
not
have
tolerated
and
congress
was
quite
well
aware
that
it
would
not
tolerate
a
reverse
of
that
provision.
and
historically,
there
has
not
been
an
expressed
authorization
for
federal
jurisdiction
to
remedy
what
is
at
bedrock
constitutional
violations
by
federal
authorities
and
in
this
case
as
well
as
title
vi,
it's
the
utilization
of
federal
funds
to
support
discriminatory
activity
which
may
well
be
and
in
many
cases
clearly
was
recognized
as
constitutional
violations
so
that
the
absence
of
a
provision
is
not
really
new.
in
fact,
the
greatest
powers
of
this
court
tracing
back
in
the
private
right
of
action
to
some
recent
cases
with
bivens
and
bell
versus
hood
but
more
deeply
through
marbury
and
all
the
way
back
to
the
king's
bench
that
where
there
is
a
legal
right
provided
unless
there
is
a
legal
remedy,
that
it's
not
much
of
a
right
and
that
of
course
is
our
basic
question.
is
this
an
empty
promise
or
will
it
be
enforced
and
for
the
present,
it
simply
must
be
enforced
by
the
courts
or
it's
not
going
to
be
enforced
at
all.
hew,
the
one
to
do
the
enforcing
has
told
us
so
and
the
facts
are
quite
clear.
moreover,
even
if
hew
could
conceivably
somehow
get
around
to
this
enormous
number
of
cases,
the
regulations
that
they
have
promulgated
and
by
the
time
title
ix
came
along
and
followed
with
the
other
legislation,
these
regulations
were
in
existence
and
known
to
counties.
mr.
john
m.
cannon
cases,
the
current
predicted
backlog
on
the
civil
rights
area
for
office
of
civil
rights
is
the
3570
predicted
as
of
this
october
with
889
involving
allegations
of
sex
discrimination.
mr.
john
m.
cannon
right.
55
million
participants
is
the
figure
of
the
extreme
potential
and
hopefully
--
mr.
john
m.
cannon
not
at
all.
it
is
the
immediacy
of
the
judicial
action
as
hew
pointed
out.
many
institutions
like
all
of
us
would
like
to
go
on
our
own
way
and
not
consider
something,
be
accused
of
a
violation
of
civil
rights.
it's
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
contemplate.
but
to
take
it
seriously
and
provide
meaningful
internal
procedures,
immediate
outside
enforcement
by
an
independent
agency
be
it
a
court
or
hew
is
necessary.
but
at
least
for
this
time,
unless
the
courts
can
step
in
and
provide
immediate
supervision,
there
cannot
be
enforcement
of
the
sweeping
language
of
congress.
and
when
the
court
considers
the
fundamental
rights
that
are
covered
by
that
promise,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
neither
the
judiciary
nor
the
executive
or
the
congress
itself
has
anymore
important
business
than
enforcing
of
social
justice
among
our
own
citizens.
mr.
john
m.
cannon
absolutely
and
it's
really,
as
hew
pointed
out
in
their
brief,
the
availability
of
the
judicial
remedy
that
is
going
to
lead
to
meaningful
internal
compliance
procedures.
and
whether
one
views
the
procedure
as
primarily
aimed
at
providing
outside
judgement
on
the
internal
affairs.
and
any
judicial
review
being
de
novo
or
under
a
standard
of
clearly
wrong
or
some
other
such
standard,
the
importance
is
its
immediacy.
a
district
judge
just
like
an
agency
is
going
to
be
influenced
by
the
quality
of
the
internal
investigation,
the
internal
record
that's
made
on
considering
the
matters
at
issue.
thank
you.
