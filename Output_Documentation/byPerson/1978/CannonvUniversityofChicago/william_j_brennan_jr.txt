how
many
of
them
are
there
do
you
suppose?
how
many
cases
are
you
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
if
you're
talking
about
private
enforcement,
i
suppose
you're
talking
about
the
possibilities
of
that
many
cases
plus
a
lot
others
that
would
--
which
would
never
get
into
the
hew
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
could
easily
handle
those.

general
mccree
before
you
sit
down.
i'm
curios
about
one
thing.
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
21,
there's
a
reference
to
the
lau
case
and
to
my
concurring
opinion
in
it,
the
brief
reads
the
relevant
portion
of
that
opinion
not
joined
by
any
other
member
of
the
court
states.
i
don't
know
who
wrote
the
brief
but
i
think
that
statement
is
incorrect.
there
was
another
member
of
the
court
who
joined
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
read
it
twice
to
be
sure
what
i
was
saying
was
correct.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
that
boil
down
mr.
bernstein
to
suggesting
that
they
were
not
opposed
to
a
private
right
of
action
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
talking
about
his
own
bill.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
talked
about
his
own
bill.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
comments
go
to
title
vi
only
or
to
title
vi
or
to
title
ix.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
--
your
comments
to
the
extent
they
address
title
vi
disagree
with
mr.
justice
stevens'
conclusions
in
bakke?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
you
think
that
was
wrong?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
lest
you
must
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course
you
do.
and
you
think
mr.
justice
white's
concurring
opinion
had
the
better
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
it
more
accurate
to
say
what
they
said
was
we
don't
intend
to
change
the
law
whatever
it
is
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
of
the
colloquy
that
congressman
railsback
in
that
judge
bauer
referred
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
fair
mr.
bernstein.
he
said
there
was
a
failure
to
create
and
he
was
unhappy
that
there
was
a
failure
to
create.
is
that
quite
the
same
as
the
statute
that
says
there
shall
be
no
other
remedy
except
the
one
we've
expressly
provided?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
exclusivity
provision
in
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
bill.
no
right
expressly
provided
upon
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
your
argument
mr.
bernstein,
you're
saying
that
these
people
on
the
admissions
committee
are
going
to
be
chilled
or
more
afraid
of
the
suit
by
someone
like
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
and
they
are
afraid
of
having
their
funds
cut
off
by
the
federal
government
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
they
engage
in
dubious
discriminatory
policy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
the
more
serious
remedy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
don't
have
to
establish
it,
the
plaintiff
has
to
prove
the
contrary.
and
i
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
doesn't
seem
to
me
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
you're
going
to
be
scared
to
death
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mrs.
cannon
but
not
worry
at
all
about
hew
cut
off
all
your
funds.
