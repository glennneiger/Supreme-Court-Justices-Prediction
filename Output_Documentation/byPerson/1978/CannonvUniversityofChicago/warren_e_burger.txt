we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
77-926,
cannon
against
the
university
of
chicago.
mr.
cannon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
hew
sees
a
violation
here
do
you
have
any
hypothesis
to
suggest
why
hew
has
not
proceeded
to
enforce
the
statute
as
you
construe
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
that
the
congress
has
given
hew
a
lethal
weapon
to
deal
with
these
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
congress
--
you're
making
a
very
good
argument
that
the
congress
should
have
affirmatively,
clearly
and
unequivocally
provided
for
a
private
action
as
an
alternative
but
is
that
an
argument
that
we
should
weigh?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you've
spoken
of
these
numbers,
that
55
million
figure
of
course
is
pretty
staggering
but
3500
isn't
all
that
staggering.
that's
roughly
a
hundred
cases
per
districts,
federal
district
although
they
would
not
be
evenly
spread
of
course.
did
i
say
a
hundred,
i
meant
to
say
300,
about
300
cases
per
district.
that's
just
a
little
bit
over
the
case
load
for
one
district
judge
on
average
case
load
figures.
so
it
isn't
quite
staggering
as
the
55
million
potential,
is
it?

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
bernstein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
that
negates
any
idea
that
congress
submitted
it
because
they
thought
it
was
unnecessary
and
already
in
there.

did
he
not?

chief

warren
e.

what
page?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
haven't
mentioned
--before
you
leave
that,
you
haven
mention
the
congressman
celler,
attorney,
the
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house
and
certainly
on
top
of
this
problem
but
he
said
over
on

25
of
their
brief

chief

page
25
of
your
brief,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.

is
it
reasonable
to
assume
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
reasonable
to
assume
mr.
bernstein
that
had
the
hew
acted
in
1976
that
there
could
have
been
by
this
time
judicial
review
of
that
administrative
determination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
they're
undertaking
to
compel
this
court
to
decide
the
scope
of
their
responsibility
instead
of
deciding
it
themselves?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
perhaps
we're
asking
you
to
define
our
terms
with
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
bernstein
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
i
took
your
reference.
we've
been
making
you
skitter
all
over
the
lot
here
but
going
back
to
that
colloquy
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
took
your
suggestion
about
policy
to
mean
that
the
legislative
history
you
we're
discussing
earlier
and
which
is
reproduced
in
the
briefs
here
indicates
that
as
a
matter
of
policy,
congress
did
not
grant
a
private
cause
of
action.
this
is
the
policy
we're
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
