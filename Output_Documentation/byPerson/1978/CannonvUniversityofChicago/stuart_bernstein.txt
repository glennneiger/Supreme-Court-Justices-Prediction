mr.
stuart
bernstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
it's
been
applied
in
the
arguments
of
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
that
title
vi
and
title
ix
are
to
be
interpreted
together.
we
may
recall
that
title
vi
was
a
subject
to
some
consideration
by
the
court
in
the
bakke
case.
it
is
our
position
that
section
1
of
each
of
these
titles
states
a
policy
and
that
section
2
creates
a
very
elaborate
enforcement
procedure
and
that
that
enforcement
procedure
is
exclusive.
we
think
that
examining
the
terms
of
the
statute
on
their
face
reveals
this.
we
think
the
setting
of
title
vi
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
where
other
titles
did
contain
specific
provision
for
private
remedy
confirms
the
intent
which
appears
from
the
face
of
it.
but
most
important
we
think
the
legislative
debates
which
gave
flesh
to
what
appears
on
the
face
of
the
statute
confirm
the
assertions
that
we
have
made
in
our
brief.
now,
throughout
this
litigation,
we
have
constantly
referred
to
the
legislative
debates,
what
was
said,
what
exchanges
we
have
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
the
house
and
up
until
last
thursday,
we
have
had
no
response
to
this
from
the
petitioner.
last
thursday
a
brief
was
filed,
a
reply
brief
which
sets
out
some
excerpts
from
the
legislative
debates
which
purport
to
make
a
point
that
the
first
section
of
title
vi
and
by
implication
title
ix
is
independent
of
the
enforcement
procedure
under
section
2
of
each
of
these
titles
and
that
therefore
the
implication
is
that
a
part
of
that
right
of
action
could
be
implied
even
though
there
was
no
expressed
provision.
since
i
could
not
anticipate
these
references
nor
will
i
have
a
further
opportunity
to
respond,
i
would
like
to
start
my
argument
with
the
reference
to
these
arguments
by
--
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
and
show
that
they
completely
is
--
or
misstated
when
i
say
that
advisably,
it
certainly
do
not
support
the
position
asserted.
the
first
exchange
described
in
the
reply
brief
is
one
between
senator
talmadge
and
senator
humphrey.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir
i
am.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no,
of
the
petitioner
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir.
no,
filed
last
thursday,
whatever
date
that
was
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
and
i'll
refer
to
page
14
of
that
brief.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
by
the
exchange
between
senator
talmadge
and
senator
humphrey
has
described
and
it
concludes
with
the
following
quotation
which
is
set
out
in
the
brief.
and
it
says
senator
talmadge
continued,
the
people
have
the
authority
to
go
to
courts
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i'm
sorry.
page
14
mr.
justice
stevens.
it
says
that
senator
talmadge
continued,
i'm
quoting,
"the
people
have
the
authority
to
go
to
court,
in
the
senator
admits
they
have
that
right".
and
senator
humphrey
is
quoted
as
responding,
"yes".
now
the
implication
of
this
is
that
they
have
the
right
to
go
to
court
under
section
1,
title
vi
and
title
ix.
well,
not
so.
this
was
the
culmination
of
a
long
statement
by
senator
talmadge
opposing
the
civil
rights
act
in
its
entirety
in
title
vi
in
particular.
and
the
point
he
was
making
that
there
was
a
preexisting
right
under
1983
for
a
right
of
action
against
the
state
action
where
discrimination
was
alleged
whether
there
was
or
was
not
federal
funding
and
his
point
was
that
the
--
this
act
which
gave
the
power
to
the
executive
to
cut
off
federal
funding
was
totally
unnecessary.
it
was
very
oppressive
and
had
the
seeds
for
destruction
of
local
government
“that
i
quote
where
he
said
just
about
that.
when
enhanced
to
the
extent
there
was
a
legitimate
governmental
interest
in
this
matter,
it
was
already
covered
under
1983.
and
it
was
in
this
context
that
he
made
the
point,
the
people
have
the
authority
to
go
to
court
and
the
senator
admits
they
have
that
right.
he
was
speaking
of
the
then
existing
state
of
the
law
not
with
the
bill
which
was
being
considered
and
senator
humphrey
responded,
"yes,
they
do".
and
then
senator
talmadge
which
sort
of
sums
up
the
point
he
was
trying
to
make
said,
"why
does
not
the
senator
relying
on
the
court's
authority
instead
of
giving
arbitrary
capricious
wholesale
punitive
power
to
some
federal
bureaucrat
to
starve
entire
cities,
towns,
states
and
regions
at
one
fell
swoop".
he
simply
didn't
like
title
vi
at
all
and
he
was
simply
urging
on
the
senate
that
they
not
adopt
it
in
its
entirety.
senator
humphrey
responded
and
i'm
reading
now
from
the
congressional
record
110,
page
5246
which
is
not
included
on
the
reply
brief.
senator
humphrey
replied,
but
we
develop
here
what
i
call
the
legislative
history.
i
wish
to
make
it
clear
that
section
602,
second
section
is
a
limitation
on
the
enforcement
of
the
law
set
out
in
section
601
of
title
vi
to
those
agencies
affected
by
title
vi.
now
that
exchange
disturbed
senator
case
because
he
thought
that
that
statement
could
be
implied
as
limiting
the
preexisting
rights
under
1983.
so
senator
case
got
into
the
act
and
he
said
to
senator
humphrey,
i'm
disturbed
about
that
limitation
language.
i
don't
want
this
statute
to
take
away
preexisting
rights.
and
that's
when
the
exchange
culminated
in
the
two
quotations
you
find
in
the
bottom
of
page
14.
now,
you'll
see
that
there
are
dots
indicating
omissions
from
those
quotations.
now,
the
dots
are
very
significant,
to
the
heart
of
this
case
but
they
have
been
omitted.
i'd
like
to
fill
the
dots
in
if
i
may.
senator
case
says
and
i'm
quoting
from
what's
in
the
brief,
“for
myself,
i
would
not
be
satisfied
if
this
language
in
section
602
is
intended
to
limit
existing
rights
of
individuals
under
the
constitution
or
to
limit
the
rights
expressed
in
section
601
in
any
substantial
sense…”
alright,
here
is
what
the
dots
say.
federal
departments
or
agencies
with
authority
to
disperse
loans,
grants
or
to
make
contracts
in
order
to
eliminate
discrimination
in
programs
in
which
those
contracts,
loans
or
grants
are
involved
must
proceed
in
the
fashion
stated.
with
that
i
agree
and
then
he
goes
on.
“that
is
the
intent.
however,
it
is
not
intended
to
limit
the
rights
of
individuals
if
they
have
any
way
of
enforcing
their
rights
apart
from
the
provisions
of
the
bill.
apart
from
the
provisions
of
the
bill
by
way
of
suit
or
any
other
procedure,
the
provision
of
the
bill
is
not
intended
to
cut
down
any
rights
that
exist”.
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
discussion
which
is
set
out
here
on
page
14.
and
then
senator
humphrey
responded
as
it
was
set
out
here.
"i
thoroughly
agree
with
the
senator
insofar
as
the
individual
is
concerned…”
then
you
see
dots
again.
now,
here's
what
the
dots
say,
“as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
he
has
his
full
constitutional
rights.
he
has
his
full
--
he
has
his
right
to
go
to
court
and
institute
suit
and
whatever
may
be
provided
in
the
law
and
in
the
constitution".
they
were
talking
about
existing
law
not
what
the
bill
would
do
and
the
implication
of
the
reply
brief
that
somehow
this
was
intended
to
enlarge
these
rights
or
the
change
of
existing
law
is
completely
foreclosed
by
the
discussion
i
have
alluded
to.
now,
there
was
one
more
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
sir
if
you
anticipate
me
because
senator
keating
then
immediately
chimed
in.
that
he
said
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
pardon?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
no,
he's
--
he
comes
right
along
and
he
said
that
he
understood
the
point
that
senator
case
was
making
and
he
was
glad
he
got
it
cleared
up
but
he
had
another
problem.
his
problem
was
that
the
bill
did
not
provide
a
private
right
of
action
for
the
individual
and
here
is
what
he
says
under
sections
--
under
section
603,
that's
the
judicial
review
section.
a
state
or
political
subdivision
of
a
state
or
an
agency
of
either
which
has
denied
funds
because
of
discrimination
--
because
discrimination
is
taking
place
is
given
the
right
of
action
in
court
but
there
is
no
correlative
right
in
the
citizen.
he
is
not
talking
about
his
bill,
he's
talking
about
this
bill.
it's
before
them
for
consideration.
if
funds
are
granted
to
discriminatory
projects
by
public
officials,
the
citizen
who
is
denied
the
benefits
of
the
project
has
no
correlative
right
to
bring
a
suit
in
court
and
he
should
have.
and
that's
why
he
find
the
bill
objectionable
but
they
never
did
change
the
bill
your
honor.
now,
clearly,
he
would
like
to
have
had
a
private
right
of
action
but
what
he
said
it
isn't
in
there
and
i
don't
like
it
and
he
never
got
it
in.
now
three
weeks
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir.
sir,
i
submit
there
is
no
other
conclusion
to
be
drawn
but
that
they
wanted
to
get
it
in,
it
wasn't
in
there
and
he
didn't
like
the
fact
that
it
was
in
there.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
pardon?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
if
he
did
sir,
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
senator
keat
--
well,
what
senator
keating
did
was
ask
the
department
of
justice
of
drafting
the
bills
to
include
such
a
provision
and
they
did
not.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that
was
earlier.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
but
three
weeks
later
then
the
--
i'm
--
what
i
quoted
occurred
on
march
13,
1964,
three
weeks
later.
i
believe
was
on
april
1st,
senator
keating
again
took
the
floor
and
it
was
during
the
course
of
senator
ribicoff's
analysis
of
title
vi
and
it
was
there
justice
stevens
that
you
find
a
quotation
which
was
set
out
in
your
concurring
opinion.
and
during
the
course
of
that,
senator
keating
got
the
floor
from
senator
ribicoff
and
he
said,
and
i
have
to
read
this
because
i
think
this
is
also
quite
critical.
as
senator
ribicoff
has
pointed
out,
both
he
and
i
felt
that
the
original
title
--
this
incidentally
is
quoted
on
page
24
of
our
brief,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
senator
ribicoff
has
pointed
out,
both
he
and
i
felt
the
original
title
vi
proposal
was
objectionable
and
that
it
emphasized
the
cutting
off
of
federal
funds
rather
than
the
ending
of
discrimination.
we
favor
a
provision
allowing
the
administrator
to
institute
a
civil
action
to
eliminate
the
discrimination
and
we
favored
judicial
review
of
the
determination
to
withhold
federal
funds.
parenthetically,
while
we
favor
the
inclusion
of
the
right
to
sue
on
the
part
of
the
agency,
the
state
or
the
facility
which
has
deprived
the
federal
funds,
we
also
favored
the
inclusion
of
a
provision
granting
the
right
to
sue
to
the
person
suffering
from
discrimination.
this
was
not
included
in
the
bill.
now
i
submit
sir
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
correct.
well,
the
bill
--
it's
hard
to
describe
it,
that
whose
bill
it
was
by
this
time
but
this
was
the
bill
now
before
--
under
consideration.
it
was
asked
that
a
provision
be
included.
the
provision
was
not
included
and
as
mr.
justice
white
has
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
bakke,
there
were
other
references
by
other
senators
to
the
same
failure
to
have
a
provisional
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
correct.
but
clearly
the
senate
knew
by
this
exchange
that
they
try
to
get
one
in
and
that
it
wasn't
in
and
he
was
decrying
it,
the
lack
of
it.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
certainly
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
i
suppose
all
of
the
congressional
debates
are
just
talk
sir
and
that's
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
what
he
is
saying
is
he
tried
to
get
it
and
he
didn't
get
it
and
i
don't
see
how
we
could
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
don't
know
except
his
concluding
statement
which
i
didn't
read
where
he
said
both
the
senator
from
connecticut
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
pardon?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
oh,
i'm
reading
in
--
on
page
24
of
our
brief
where
he
completes
the
statement
before
the
senate
where
he
says,
however,
both
the
senator
from
connecticut
and
i
are
grateful
that
our
other
suggestions
were
adopted
by
the
justice
department.
i
assume
that
he
felt
that
he
wasn't
going
to
get
it
and
he
abided
at
that
point.
but
clearly,
he
expressed
the
point
of
view
that
he
wanted
it
in
and
he
wasn't
in
there.
and
what
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no
sir
--
and
title
ix
sir
because
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes.
you
have
--
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
be
(voice
overlap)
to
my
response
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
i
think
it
was
wrong.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
think
so.
i
think
that
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
it
could
be.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
correct.
that's
correct
and
we've
addressed
that
of
course
in
our
briefs
your
honor.
i
think
all
of
us
have
agreed
--
all
the
petitioners,
solicitor
general
all
the
amici
in
this
case.
there
are
many
of
them.
we
all
agree
that
the
legislative
history
of
title
vi
carries
over
to
title
ix
and
senator
bayh
so
said
when
he
introduced
title
ix.
he
says,
“we're
doing
the
same
thing
we
did
under
title
ix
provides
the
same
procedures,
the
same
regulations
that
have
worked
so
well
under
title
vi”.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
below,
there
was
no
indication
that
any
senator
or
any
legislator
was
aware
of
anyone
of
these
cases
that
had
been
referred
to
in
their
briefs.
further
as
we
have
repeatedly
asserted
here,
these
cases
at
most
were
equivocal
on
the
point
because
the
jurisdictional
basis
was
not
necessarily
title
vi
itself.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
there
is
an
implication
that
there
is
such
a
thing
but
i
haven't
found.
we
have
a
rather
carefully
calm
and
i'll
--
in
all
candor.
i
must
say
we
haven't
found
that
reference
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
--
this
is
the
thrust
of
the
law.
whatever
the
law
--
it
was
--
whatever
they
did
in
1964
in
title
vi,
that
was
the
thrust
of
what
senator
bayh
said
when
he
introduced
the
bill.
i
haven't
set
out
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
oh,
that
referred
not
to
the
adoption
of
title
ix
but
to
the
civil
rights
attorney's
award
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
which
occurred
just
last
year
while
this
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
hearing.
it
was
an
entirely
different
matter.
what
we
submit
is
that
apart
from
the
clearer
construction
of
the
statute
and
apart
from
its
setting
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
‘64
that
the
legislative
history
which
i
have
referred
to
here
clearly
supports
our
side
if
you
apply
the
second
test
of
cort
v.
ash
namely,
was
there
an
attempt
of
congress
to
deny
or
create?
and
senator
keating
says
there
was
an
intent
to
deny
and
he
decried
the
--
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
suppose
we
have
trouble
on
how
we
read
the
words
but
what
he
says
that
the
citizen
who
denies
the
benefits
has
no
right
to
bring
the
suit
in
court.
i
think
he
is
saying
that
there
is
no
right
to
bring
a
suit
in
court.
he
is
not
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
on
the
bill
of
their
passing.
that's
the
bill
they
ultimately
passed.
now
if
he
says
that,
i
--
you
know
we
can
play
with
the
words
just
to
putting
it
positively
or
negatively
but
i
think
he
says
there
is
no
right.
i
think
he
says
it
almost
in
high
(inaudible).
i
think
to
conclude
this
part
of
my
presentation,
i
think
that
this
clearly
--thoroughly
sets
out
that
with
respect
to
the
second
test
and
we
accept
the
first
and
fourth
as
set
out
by
solicitor
general.
but
the
second
test
namely
what
is
the
intent
of
the
congress.
i
think
it
could
be
--
it
could
hardly
be
clearer.
that
really
has
nothing
to
do
whether
i
think
the
university
of
chicago
would
be
overburdened
if
every
disappointed
applicant
would
run
to
the
court
or
if
mrs.
cannon
thinks
it's
unfair
that
she
doesn't
have
her
day
in
the
court.
it's
what
the
congress
say
and
i
think
they
spoke
fairly
clear
and
i
like
to
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well
sir,
i
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
page
25.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
this
is
titles
--
title
vi.
the
difficulty
is
that
there
was
a
very
little
legislative
history
on
title
ix
other
than
its
introduction
by
senator
bayh
and
that's
why
all
the
legislative
history
referred
to
in
the
briefs
here
goes
back
to
title
vi.
and
everybody
agrees,
in
fact
its
claim
that
one
was
a
photocopy
of
the
other
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
we
think
that's
quite
right.
if
there
is
a
private
action
under
title
vi,
there's
one
under
your
title
ix.
but
this
was
all
under
title
vi.
i'd
like
to
get
to
the
third
test
of
the
court
we
asked
namely
whether
it's
consistent
with
the
underlying
legislative
scheme.
and
here,
i'd
like
to
pick
up
the
reply
brief
of
the
--
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general.
you
may
recall
mr.
justice
white
made
the
point
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
bakke
that
to
permit
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
first
section
who
had
been
affect
to
be
--
to
bypass
the
elaborate
administrative
procedure
under
section
2.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well
sir,
i
recognize
that
i
have
that
burden.
i
--
but
i'm
glad
to
have
your
support.
i
trust
(inaudible)
--
i'm
hoping
that
my
eloquence
can
convince
some
other
members
of
the
court.
the
justice
department
took
issue
with
mr.
justice
white's
statement
that
represented
a
bypass
--
would
represent
a
bypass
of
the
administrative
procedure
and
they
said
there's
no
inconsistency.
yet
they
said
or
let
me
point
the
fact
out.
mrs.
cannon's
complaint
was
filed
with
them
in
april
of
1975
and
they
still
haven't
done,
acted
on
it.
they
completed
their
on-sight
investigations,
university
of
chicago,
northwestern
university
in
june
of
1976.
at
least
they
so
advised
here
in
june
‘76
on-sight
investigations
have
been
completed.
the
question
she
raises
concerning
age
raises
issues
national
in
scope.
they
have
to
have
national
policy
on
it
and
they
assure
her
they
will
act
expeditiously
as
possible.
that
letter
from
hew
set
was
in
appendix
for
the
petition
for
certiorari.
it's
from
hew
to
mrs.
cannon.
that
was
1976
and
nothing
has
happened
yet.
what
they
said
in
their
original
brief
to
this
court
was
that
if
the
court
should
decide
there
is
no
private
right
of
action
then
they
will
complete
their
investigation.
or
if
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
the
administrative
and
judicial
procedure
why
wait
until
this
court
acts.
it
should
be
irrelevant.
they
should
have
gone
ahead
and
completed
it.
they
explained
in
their
reply
brief
something
else.
they
say
that,
and
i
think
i
can
quote
the
words
exactly.
they
say
that
since
the
district
court,
the
courts
have
decided
there
was
no
private
right
of
action
and
since
hew
couldn't
itself
resolve
that
question,
it
was
going
to
defer
further
action
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
nobody
asked
hew
to
decide
that.
that's
not
their
function.
their
function
is
not
to
decide
whether
there
is
a
private
right
of
action.
their
function
is
to
act
on
administrative
complaints
under
section
2.
it
is
clear
that
what
hew
was
saying
that
if
you
decide
there
is
a
private
right
of
action,
we'll
just
wash
your
hands
for
this
matter,
we
won't
go
any
further.
if
they
don't
mean
that,
why
have
they
waited?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
why
have
they
waited
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
of
course
your
honor,
that
is
of
course
true
and
i
must
express
some
concern
and
sympathy
with
mrs.
cannon's
place.
i
think
it's
unfair
that
she's
had
to
wait
this
long.
but
its
--
i
think
it's
a
doing
of
hew
and
i
say
that
in
all
candor
and
perhaps
with
a
little
anger.
i
think
hew
has
pulled
itself
on
by
its
bootstraps.
it
has
enacted
and
it
says,
you
see,
we
can't
act
and
therefore,
we
wanted
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
i
think
the
responsibility
is
clear.
they
--
nobody
can
say
they
haven't
suggested
that
they
have
no
authority
under
section
2
to
proceed.
i
don't
think
they
need
this
court
to
tell
them
that.
that's
clear.
i
think
what
they're
saying
is
that
if
this
court
says
you
can
go
to
court
then
we
don't
proceed
and
that's
the
bypass
that
justice
white
was
talking
about.
it's
inevitable.
we
got
another
dilemma.
let's
suppose
they
do
proceed
two
ways,
administratively
and
judicially.
it
comes
up
in
court
under
one
standard
of
review.
it
comes
up
through
the
administrative
agency
and
judicial
review
under
the
apa
standard
review
which
is
entirely
different
so
you
can
--
the
conception
of
it
at
least,
the
same
court
can
decide
the
same
question
under
different
standards
and
come
out
different
ways.
the
dilemma
is
simply
unavoidable.
it
seems
to
me
if
the
court
please
that
there
is
no
way
you
can
give
credit
to
the
elaborate
scheme
under
section
2
of
each
of
the
statutes
if
you
allow
an
independent
private
right
of
action.
judicial
review
is
another
matter.
so
i
submit
that
this
clearly
sets
forth
the
answer
to
the
third
cort
v.
ash
test.
now
the
government
makes
one
other
point
in
its
reply
brief.
it
--
i
think
it
was
lecturing
me
but
i'm
not
quite
sure
about
my
failure
to
perceive
the
difference
between
primary
jurisdiction
and
exhaustion
of
remedies.
and
they
are
--
they
go
to
great
detail
to
explain
that
in
circumstances
like
this
where
they
are
in
court
on
our
title
vi
case.
they
may
under
the
appropriate
circumstance
ask
the
court
to
defer
action
while
they
complete
the
administrative
process
and
they
say
that's
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction.
that's
what
they're
talking
about
in
the
--
it
seem
particularly
upset
by
my
statement
that
i
was
confused
about
their
course
of
conduct
in
various
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
brief.
the
unfortunate
part
of
the
government's
position
is
that
they
in
fact
in
the
terry
versus
methodist
hospital
of
gary
case
which
we
refer
to
in
our
brief,
they
themselves
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
--
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
of
lack
of
exhaustion.
the
very
point
we're
trying
to
make
they
themselves
made
but
now
they
denied
that.
well,
they
withdrew
that
motion
subsequently
but
they
withdrew
it
not
because
they
felt
the
exhaustion
doctrine
was
improper
but
because
they
wanted
as
they
explained
in
the
later
document,
they
wanted
to
facilitate
settlement.
so
they
themselves
had
adopted
the
exhaustion
argument
if
the
court
please.
so
we're
not
doing
anything
noble
here
that
seems
to
me
it's
inevitable
that
you
do
that
if
you're
to
make
any
sense
out
of
the
statute,
otherwise
you
will
have
a
shamus.
well
under
--
i
think
this
is
the
essence
of
my
case
because
what
i'm
really
talking
about
is
what
congress
intended
and
not
what
mr.
cannon
wants
or
what
i
want.
it's
ultimately
what
the
congress
said.
a
few
minor
things,
i
--
they
weren't
touched
upon
but
i've
--
they
are
in
the
briefs
and
that
is
the
reason
of
managements
to
the
age
discrimination
act
which
now
provides
for
a
specific
right
of
action
with
exhaustion.
and
we
made
the
point
in
our
brief
that
this
manifested
an
attempt
that
when
congress
means
they
have
a
right
of
action
under
these
kinds
of
statutes,
it
knows
how
to
say
so
clearly.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
understand
sir.
if
you
forget,
i'm
dong
this
in
the
defensive
posture.
they
said
that
i
can't
read
the
amendment
that
way
because
the
amendment
implies
a
preexisting
right.
i
simply
wanted
to
call
to
your
attention
of
the
conference
report
which
we
haven't
had
a
chance
to
do
before
because
there
was
a
difference
between
the
house
and
the
senate
on
that
issue
where
the
conference
report
says
as
follows.
the
house
bill
amended
the
age
discrimination
act
of
1975
by
specifically
providing
for
a
private
right
of
action
for
a
violation
of
the
act.
i'm
responding
to
the
point
i
make
that
that
really
wasn't
what
was
done
and
i
point
to
the
conference
report
to
say
that
that
was
done.
i
agree
that
actions
of
subsequent
legislatures
are
not
very
significant
in
trying
to
shed
light
on
what
proceeded.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
alright
sir.
i
accept
that.
i
--
i've
--
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
is
the
essence
of
our
position.
in
summary,
it
is
again
not
--
oh,
i'm
sorry
but
i
want
to
think
i
have
to
refer
to.
solicitor
general
said
in
his
reply
brief
that
if
--
going
to
court
is
really
not
a
very
serious
problem.
all
you
have
to
do
is
have
the
judge
ask
the
question,
for
example
mrs.
cannon,
was
she
kept
out
because
of
her
age
or
for
some
other
reason?
and
once
you
answer
that
question,
that's
easy.
i
have
the
impression
that
whoever
wrote
that
brief
for
the
solicitor
had
never
tried
a
case.
if
it
was
that
easy,
we
would
not
be
here.
we
would
have
done
just
that.
it's
a
little
more
complicated
than
that.
what
our
concern
is
you
see,
is
the
date
--
they
put
--
the
posing
of
the
admissions
committee.
mr.
cannon
already
filed
a
notice
in
the
district
court
to
take
the
deposition
of
dean
ceithaml
who
is
the
chairman
of
the
admissions
committee
at
the
university
of
chicago
medical
school.
well,
what
will
lead
the
(inaudible)
about?
well,
why
wasn't
--
why
wasn't
mrs.
cannon
acceptable?
how
about
these
other
2000
that
you
say
would
better
be
heard
and
were
turned
down?
how
about
the
104
you
accepted.
we
have
5500
people
that
we
can
have
a
discovery
about.
he
has
full
discovery
available.
he's
already
served
the
notice
to
discover
all
that
we
have
unheard
including
any
references
that
we've
got
through
her
applications
that
is
references
from
third
parties.
all
of
that's
available
and
that
is
what's
involved.
it
isn't
simply
a
matter
of
the
university
coming
in
and
saying,
“mr.
judge,
we
didn't
admit
this
lady
because
of
her
grades”.
mr.
cannon
wouldn't
be
satisfied
with
that
and
he'd
be
a
bad
lawyer
if
he
was.
he
wants
to
know
why
and
we're
subject
to
that
and
i
submit
to
you.
you
put
an
admissions
committee
to
that
once
and
you're
not
going
to
do
this
again.
they're
going
to
make
their
decisions
on
strict
grades
and
nothing
else
because
then
you
can't
get
at
them.
and
that's
what
they're
worried
about
and
that's
what
we're
worried
about
and
that's
why
we
say
in
our
brief
that
at
the
bottom,
this
is
an
academic
freedom
issue
because
this
court
has
said,
you've
cited
the
harvard
admissions
program
where
diversity
is
a
desirable
factor
in
student
bodies.
we
set
out
our
admissions
program
which
is
aimed
to
the
same
end
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
but
if
you
submit
us
to
this
kind
of
court
proceeding,
its
--
you
were
not
going
to
have
any.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no
sir,
i
really
don't.
i'm
picking
up
the
point
that
was
made
repeatedly
in
bakke
by
--
with
great
concern.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
by
justice
powell
and
i
believe
by
justice
blackmun
justice
blackmun.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
that's
when
the
case
is
over
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
when
the
case
--
that's
how
the
case
ends
but
it's
getting
from
the
beginning
--
from
the
complaint
of
that
stage
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
that's
the
discovery
--
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
oh
sure.
but
that
begs
the
question.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
what
it
does,
it
exposes
the
university
to
this
kind
of
thing
by
any
number
of
disappointed
applicants
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
bankruptcy
your
honor
is
not
the
point.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well
your
honor,
maybe
i
should
have
stayed
out
of
this
thicket
to
--
when
they
had
the
opportunity
but
having
gotten
into
it,
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
out
of
it.
what
we
are
concerned
about
sir
is
that
if
you
shift
the
arena,
no
matter
how
it
comes
out
as
i
stated
in
our
brief.
we're
not
concerned
about
the
ultimate
merits
of
the
case.
we
have
not
conceded
the
--
but
for
the
question
at
all.
but
if
you
start
the
discovery
route,
if
you
start
that
route,
you're
going
to
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
independence
of
the
admissions
committee.
i
think
that's
inevitable
and
your
honors
had
sufficient
trial
experience
i
know.
it's
to
know
the
problem
of
clients
and
the
deposition
procedure.
it
does
have
a
chilling
effect
and
this
is
our
concern.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
it's
a
multi
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
i
really
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
think
i
was
doing
pretty
well.
i
--
by
chilling
effect
i
mean
is
this,
is
that
the
concern
of
academics
that
they
will
have
to
justify
their
decisions
in
a
court
of
law.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir,
i
am
sorry.
i'm
not
--
i'm
proceeding
on
the
assumption
now
that
in
terms
of
the
policies
involved
here
that
to
the
extent
that
that
enters
into
that.
there
is
a
strong
policy
which
would
militate
against
the
private
right
of
action
and
that
if
this
issue
is
going
to
be
exported
or
to
be
explored
fully
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
policy
that
i
have
enunciated
about
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
the
policy
comes
from
the
fact
that
i
think
that
if
you
implicate
the
judiciary
in
admissions
decisions
then
you
have
a
threatened
academic
freedom.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i'm
speaking
of
academic
freedom
sir
in
the
same
sense
that
it
was
used
by
justice
powell
in
bakke.
it
--
i
think
it
was
a
quasi
constitutional
right.
i
forget
the
(voice

--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i'm
waiting
for
the
red
light.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
well
i
enjoy
this
so
i'd
like
to
take
a
stand
on
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no
sir,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir,
i
have
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
have
the
--
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
has
been
no
discrimination.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
question
is
where
do
you
establish
that
fact?
that's
(inaudible)
that's
the
issue.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
when
we're
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
when
we're
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
sir?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
we're
--
well,
i
can
only
repeat
what
i've
said
your
honor
that
this
case,
we
think
--
we'll
open
the
floodgates
to
a
multiplicity
of
suits
or
the
description
of
some
3500
things
pending
before
hew
all
of
which
could
be
shifted
to
the
courts
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
certainly
it's
afraid
of
(inaudible)
i
agree
that
not
all
of
these
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
correct,
that's
correct
of
course.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
we're
picking
up
academic
freedom
again
your
honor
because
academic
freedom
seemed
to
be
a
concern
of
this
court
or
at
least
the
two
of
its
members
in
the
bakke
case.
we
are
an
academic
institution,
northwestern
university
is
an
academic
institution
and
we
are
concerned
about
the
same
matters
of
this
act
about
academic
freedom.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
right,
that's
correct.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
your
honor.
that's
our
--
the
second
cort
v.
ash
test
as
to
what
the
congress
would
have.
yes
sir.
thank
you.
