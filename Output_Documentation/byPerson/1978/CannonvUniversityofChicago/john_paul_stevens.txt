justice
john

what
page
of
the
reply
brief
on
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
was
that
earlier
mr.
bernstein?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
says,
this
was
not
included
in
the
bill,
he
means
the
department
of
justice
didn't
include
it
in
its
bill.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
request
by
senator
keating
was
to
department
of
justice.
there
was
no
formal
amendment
introduced
by
senator
keating
or
any
bill
proposed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
rule
if
it
applies
doesn't
apply
just
the
schools,
it
applies
to
hospitals
and
all
sorts
of
other
things,
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
isn't
the
same
--
its
just
an
academic
freedom
issues,
the
question
of
what
--
how
to
construe
this
statute?
