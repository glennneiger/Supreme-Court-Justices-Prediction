justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
import
if
any
do
you
attach
to
senator
keating's
inability
to
get
a
private
right
of
action
included
in
the
original
title
vi?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
come
back
a
moment
to
the
distinction
you
make
between
title
vii
and
title
ix
with
respect
to
congress
in
title
vii
having
impose
limitations
on
the
use
of
the
private
remedy.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
puzzles
me
is
why
congress
should
have
taken
a
different
view
if
it
did
in
title
ix
in
view
of
the
capacity
of
the
private
remedy
to
disrupt
education
and
the
freedom
of
faculties
to
choose
student
bodies.
in
this
case
for
example,
there
were
some
2,000
applicants
whose
academic
credential
were
superior
to
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
so
that
i
suppose
if
they
had
chosen
to
bring
individual
suits,
there
could
have
been
2000
additional
suits.
the
disruption
to
the
colleges
would
be
vastly
greater
one
would
think
than
the
disruption
to
private
industry
as
result
of
claims
under
title
vii.
what
policy
considerations
could've
motivated
congress
to
make
the
distinction
you
draw?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
--
may
i
comment
on
your
first
answer.
in
view
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
how
could
congress
had
been
queasy
about
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
enact
title
vii?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
window
washers
had
been
held
to
be
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
had
a
second
reason
and
i
interrupted
you.
