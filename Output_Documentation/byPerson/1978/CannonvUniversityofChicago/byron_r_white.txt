justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
--
do
you
think
title
ix
would
be
construed
to
be
a
civil
rights
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
some
other
sections
of
the
civil
rights
act
when
they
wanted
a
private
cause
of
action,
they
provided
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that
if
congress
had
expressly
provided
for
a
private
cause
of
action
under
this
section,
it
wouldn't
have
limited
it
or
conditioned
it
upon
exhausting
administrative
remedies
or
anything
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
--
that
is
somewhat
of
a
bootstrap.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it's
maybe
clear
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
speaking
--
the
reply
brief
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
the
federal
respondents?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
that
were
true
that
--
if
the
congress
came
along
and
enacted
title
ix,
there
could
be
a
different
provision
in
title
ix.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
could
be
a
different
legislative
history
in
title
ix
or
there
could
be
the
existing
legal
environment
could
be
such
that
you
had
to
assume
congress
knew
what
the
law
was
or
what
the
lower
courts
set
the
law
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

the
courts
had
already
sent
what
they
thought
that
title
vi
did
even
if
you
might
disagree
with
what
some
lower
court
said.
what
if
the
lower
courts
had
held
this
and
the
senator
when
he
was
talking
had
those
cases
specifically
in
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
that
it
also
in
the
legislature
viewed
title
ix,
there
were
some
senators
who
expressly
addressed
the
question
and
said,
it
should
--
this
shouldn't
be
--
we
are
not
indicating
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
the
difficulty
as
in
this
case,
i
was
the
only
one
who
filed
that
--
