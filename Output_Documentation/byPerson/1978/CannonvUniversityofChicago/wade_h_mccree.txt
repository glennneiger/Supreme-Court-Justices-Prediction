mr.
mccree
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government's
position
in
this
matter
is
essentially
that
presented
by
my
brother
just
a
few
moments
ago
that
we
have
a
statute
that
requires
the
construction
of
this
court
to
determine
whether
it
was
--
whether
it
affords
a
private
remedy
against
a
private
party
that
is
a
recipient
of
federal
funds
in
the
education
area.
we
argue
that
three
years
before
the
statute
was
enacted,
namely
in
1969
in
allen
versus
the
state
board
of
election,
this
court
was
confronted
with
the
necessity
of
construing
a
similar
statute.
that
statute
provided
no
person
shall
be
denied
the
right
to
vote
for
failure
to
comply
with
a
newly
covered
enactment
that
the
statute
consisted
of.
that
of
course
required
the
preclearance
of
changes
in
election
laws.
and
there
was
an
elaborate
scheme
of
enforcement
which
ultimately
required
the
attorney
general
to
bring
an
action
in
--
with
the
restricted
venue
to
the
district
of
columbia
to
see
whether
the
election
change
required
preclearance
to
see
that
it
didn't
offend
the
objectives
of
the
statute.
now
in
a
case
with
as
complicated,
an
administrative
procedure
for
enforcement
even
requiring
the
bringing
of
the
action
by
the
attorney
general
in
a
particular
venue,
this
court
nevertheless
looking
at
the
language,
no
person
shall
be
denied
the
right
to
vote
for
failure
to
comply
found
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
congress
not
only
to
create
a
private
right
in
an
individual
but
also
to
afford
him
a
remedy
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
mccree
the
funding,
the
federal
funding
of
the
agency,
i
believe
the
federal
government
has
the
authority
--
the
congress
has
the
authority
to
determine
how
its
funding
will
be
expanded
by
a
recipient.
mr.
mccree
well,
1343
section
4
which
isn't
restricted
to
a
state,
the
action
--
our
action
under
the
color
of
a
state
right
would
be
the
jurisdictional
basis
for
it.
and
if
title
ix
was
found
to
create
a
private
cause
of
action,
13434
would
afford
jurisdiction
for
federal
court
to
entertain
it.
and
that's
the
crux
of
our
argument
that
section
9
does
create
a
private
cause
of
action
against
a
private
recipient
of
federal
funds.
and
if
it
does
jurisdiction
lies
and
the
court
should've
heard
the
matter.
mr.
mccree
well,
1331
is
a
general
federal
question
statute
and
1331
would
--
mr.
mccree
--
require
a
monet
--
jurisdictional
amount
and
13434
is
--
has
been
construed
as
not
requiring
it.
mr.
mccree
and
so
we
would
look
to
that
of
whether
mrs.
cannon
would
have
--
could
show
the
jurisdictional
amount
is
problematic.
she
didn't
attempt
to.
her
action
is
clearly
under
13434.
mr.
mccree
i
would
say
that
title
ix
should
clearly
be
construed
to
be
a
civil
right
statute.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
title
ix
was
originally
contemplated
as
an
amendment
to
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
but
later
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
education
amendments
of
1972
but
its
clear
language
that
no
person
shall
on
the
basis
of
sex
be
denied
participation
in
or
be
--
or
deny
the
benefits
of
or
be
discriminated
against
in
any
federally
financed
education
program
clearly
is
the
kind
of
language
the
congress
has
used
when
it
has
intended
to
confer
a
private
right
of
action
to
remedy
a
deprivation
of
civil
rights.
senator
birch
bayh
who
was
the
sponsor
of
title
ix
in
the
senate,
clearly
stated
that
the
purpose
of
title
ix
was
to
eradicate
the
years
of
discrimination
against
particularly
women
but
it
wasn't
limited
to
women
against
persons
on
the
basis
of
sex.
so
i
think
13433
would
certainly
--
its
requirement
of
it
being
a
civil
rights
statute
would
certainly
be
satisfied
in
that
respect.
mr.
mccree
634,
i
beg
your
pardon
and
thank
you
for
correcting
me.
we
submit
that
the
congress
on
the
basis
of
the
construction
given
to
language
which
commences
no
person
shall
be
denied
a
specific
right
has
reason
to
and
does
in
fact
utilize
that
language
when
it
intends
to
create
a
private
right
and
to
create
a
private
remedy.
we
suggest
that
because
in
a
series
of
civil
rights
acts
whenever
the
congress
has
intended
they're
not
to
be
a
private
right
of
action,
it
is
expressly
stated
that
the
administrative
remedy
will
be
exclusive
and
--
mr.
mccree
that
is
correct
if
the
court
please
but
it
is
done
so
for
a
specific
purpose
of
showing
a
limitation
on
the
private
cause
of
action
that
was
created.
for
example
in
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
concerned
with
public
accommodations,
there
was
the
expressed
grant
of
a
private
action
but
it
was
specifically
limited
and
restricted
similarly
in
title
vii
which
was
the
employment,
the
qual
employment
opportunities
part
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
there
was
the
express
grant
of
a
private
act
but
specifically
limited
to
require
the
utilization
of
state
facilities
for
processing
claims
of
this
sort
and
then
subsequently
the
federal
agency
that
was
set
up
and
requiring
certain
time
limits
to
be
followed.
mr.
mccree
i
can
only
suggest
that
the
congress
did
not
do
so
and
when
it
enacted
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
it
also
did
not
do
so.
and
of
course,
title
vi
--
mr.
mccree
it
may
very
well
be
but
the
congress
has
a
clear
pattern
here
of
using
the
language
--
mr.
mccree
i
think
that
so.
i
think
that
explains
why
we're
here
this
morning.
mr.
mccree
but
congress
apparently
has
relied
upon
this
language
formula
to
create
a
private
cause
of
action
when
it
intends
to
do
this.
now
on
the
other
hand,
the
congress
has
used
other
kinds
of
language
formulae
when
it
has
intended
to
do
it.
for
example,
the
congress
should
have
said
--
could
have
said
that
no
educational
institution
shall
--
or
any
educational
institution
that
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
sex
will
not
receive
federal
funding.
and
in
such
an
instance,
i
would
be
hard
put
to
argue
that
someone
who
felt
discriminated
against
could
find
from
that
a
private
right
created
in
him
and
a
federal
remedy
to
vindicate
that
right.
but
here,
the
language
consistently
runs
through
the
series
of
civil
rights
actions
which
are
intended
to
remedy
against
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
on
the
basis
of
sex,
on
the
basis
of
age,
on
the
basis
of
physical
handicaps.
this
language
no
person
shall
be
discriminated
against.
and
when
it
intended
to
give
a
restricted
right
of
action,
it
so
expressed
itself
as
it
did
in
title
ii
and
in
title
vii,
when
it
intended
to
have
no
private
cause
of
action
despite
the
use
of
that
language.
it
has
expressly
stated
that
the
administrative
remedy
will
be
exclusive
as
it
did
in
title
iii
of
the
older
american
amendments
of
1975
but
when
it
did
neither,
it
appears
that
the
congress
intended
then
for
the
recipient
of
this
right
to
be
afforded
a
federal
remedy.
mr.
mccree
well,
i
think
that's
the
most
difficult
part
of
my
argument
here
and
all
i
can
suggest
was
that
the
--
he
knew
too,
however,
that
if
this
language
formula
was
used
that
he
need
not
win
his
effort
for
an
expression
but
an
expressed
grant.
and
the
congress
did
use
this
linguistic
formula
even
though
he
was
unable
to
get
there.
if
the
congress
had
intended
not
to
grant
a
private
remedy
then
it
would
not
have
concluded
nearly
with
rebuffing
senator
keating
it
would
seem
to
me
but
it
would've
expressed
the
contrary
or
would've
utilized
contrary
language
as
we
can
see
it
did
in
this
other
statutes.
this
court
of
course
address
the
--
this
whole
matter
of
determining
when
a
--
when
there
should
be
an
extension
of
a
civil
remedy
to
a
person
injured
by
another's
breach
of
a
right
granted
in
the
case
of
cort
versus
ash
in
1975
and
suggested
for
questions
that
must
be
answered
and
i
would
like
to
consider
those
for
a
few
minutes.
the
first
one
of
course
is
whether
the
plaintiff
is
one
of
the
class
for
whose
special
benefit
the
statute
was
created.
i
think
its
irrefutable
here
that
mrs.
cannon
is
one
of
the
class
for
whose
special
benefit
the
statute
was
created.
i
think
we
can
conclude
without
argument
that
she
was
a
person
who
was
to
have
received
a
federal
right
and
that
she
did
indeed
receive
it.
i
argued
as
i
we
do
on
our
brief
on
page
46
in
the
following
pages
that
the
use
of
the
language
has
been
consistent
in
this
respect.
the
second
question
of
course
is
whether
there
is
any
indication
of
legislative
intent
to
create
a
private
remedy
or
not.
now
of
course
if
there
was
convincing
evidence
of
intent,
we
wouldn't
even
apply
the
cort
versus
ash
formula
if
there
was
unmistakable
evidence
that
there
was
no
intent
that
would
conclude
our
discussion
and
if
there
was
unmistakable
evidence,
there
was
intent,
it
would
as
well.
here,
we
have
to
conclude
that
the
evidence
is
ambivalent.
nevertheless,
we
suggest
that
such
evidence
does
exist,
does
favor
the
finding
that
the
legislature
intended
to
do
it.
i
suggested
before
the
consistency
of
the
language
and
i
direct
the
court's
attention
also
to
the
fact
that
there
were
lower
court
cases
granting
a
private
remedy
in
title
vi
after
which
title
ix
was
adopted
at
the
time
the
congress
adopted
title
ix.
now,
whether
the
congress
was
acutely
and
actually
aware
of
those
decisions,
i
can't
argue
but
i
certainly
can
suggest
that
they
were
there
for
the
congress'
direction.
but
even
if
we
concede
that
the
second
point
that
of
legislative
intent
is
ambivalent,
we
proceed
to
the
third
point,
is
it
consistent
with
the
underlying
purpose
to
imply
a
remedy.
i
suggest
that
the
answer
here
is
a
compelling
yes.
my
brother
has
indicated
the
problem
of
the
--
of
numbers
that
would
make
it
difficult
for
persons
whose
rights
were
offended
to
get
a
private
remedy.
i
would
also
add
that
the
cutoff
isn't
a
remedy
for
mrs.
cannon
and
if
the
government
should
cutoff
the
funds,
she
and
many
persons
like
here
would
still
be
without
a
remedy.
also
in
the
case
of
a
single
grant,
single
federal
grant
with
nothing
in
the
way
of
sustaining
funds
contemplated,
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
cutoff.
and
yet
she
would
be
without
any
administrative
remedy
at
all
because
there
isn't
anything
the
administrative
agency
could
do
for
her.
and
finally,
whether
this
is
a
right
traditionally
relegated
to
state
law,
i
suggest
that
this
is
uniquely
federal
because
federal
funds
are
involved
and
the
federal
government
has
a
right
to
be
free
from
discrimination
or
to
see
that
its
funds
are
not
employed
to
discriminate.
i
would
conclude
by
saying
that
private
litigation
is
an
indispensable
compliment
of
the
government
action
if
the
goals
of
title
ix,
freedom
from
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
are
to
be
achieved.
thank
you.
mr.
mccree
yes
sir.
mr.
mccree
mr.
justice
powell,
i
believe
there
are
two
answers
to
the
question.
the
first
one
is
title
vii,
the
employment
case
was
an
area
under
which
the
congress
has
not
ventured
before
and
the
basis
for
its
jurisdiction
there
was
the
commerce
clause.
and
it
was
extending
some
previously
understood
concepts
of
the
commerce
clause
and
therefore
i
thought
it
should
closely
restrict
their
private
remedy
as
it
explored
this
new
area
of
extending
federal
power.
here
under
title
ix,
there
is
absolutely
no
question
about
the
power
of
the
congress
to
control
the
spending
of
federal
funds.
and
so
it
need
not
have
felt
as
queasy
about
proceeding
--
about
forwarding
a
private
remedy
there.
i
think
the
second
answer
is
--
mr.
mccree
well
--
mr.
mccree
but
the
congress
had
not
done
so
in
the
--
in
any
discrimination
areas.
this
was
his
first
venture
in
that
field.
mr.
mccree
well,
i
would
think
it
would.
i
would
think
the
fair
labor
standards
act
rationale
was
the
impact
of
just
economic
factors
on
the
commerce
and
here,
the
nation
at
the
time
title
vii
was
enacted
was
finally
addressing
some
unfinished
business
of
eliminating
discrimination
based
on
race
and
there
were
reservations
about
it.
and
--
mr.
mccree
i
would
suggest
that
the
second
reason
is
unawareness
that
although
title
vi
had
been
lost
since
1964,
there
had
been
no
disruption
of
educational
programs
across
the
nation
as
the
question
suggested
might
result
if
2000
students
who
ranked
below
the
particular
applicant
brought
a
case.
my
experience
--
my
observation
has
been
that
title
vi
has
not
resulted
in
an
inundation
of
the
courts
by
--
on
the
basis
of
persons
who
believe
themselves
aggrieved
because
of
race.
and
i
don't
think
the
same
thing
would
happen
under
title
ix
on
the
basis
of
sex
and
i
think
the
congress
was
probably
aware
of
that.
if
--
mr.
mccree
i
apologize
for
the
--
i
apologize
for
the
error
and
i
appreciate
the
courts
going
into
my
brief.
mr.
mccree
i'll
try
not
to
have
that
happen
again
mr.
justice.
thank
you.
