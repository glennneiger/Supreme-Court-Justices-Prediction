justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
what
do
you
suppose
would
be
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
case
such
as
this
against
the
university
of
chicago
where
you
don't
have
any
state
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
doubt
of
that
but
what
statutory
provision
would
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts.
i
would
suppose
1343
would
do
it
in
the
case
of
a
federal
--
of
a
state
university
but
what
about
a
private
university?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
a
different
congress
than
the
one
that
enacted
title
ix.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
really
only
proves
that
this
particular
congress
knew
how
to
create
a
prior
cause
of
action
not
necessarily
that
the
proceeding
it
wanted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
get
academic
freedom?
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
some
sort
of
constitutional
right
that
favors
you
because
“academic
freedom”
is
involved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
justice
powell's
opinion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
chilling
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
granted
you
can
say
what
do
we
mean
by
a
chilling
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
--
if
the
petitioner
is
right,
the
congress
intended
to
chill
admissions
committee
decisions
based
on
sex.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
does
that
policy
come
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
a
moment
ago
in
response
to
my
question
that
you
didn't
assert
any
constitutional
claim
based
on
academic
freedom.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
is
a
quasi
constitutional
right?
