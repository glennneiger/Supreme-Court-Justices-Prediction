we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
smith
against
maryland.
mr.
cardin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
not--
are
you
suggesting
this
couldn't
be
done
without
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
couldn't
be
done
under
any
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
don't
you--
are
you
suggesting
there
is
no
right
of
privacy
or
no
expectation
of
privacy
as
to
what
calls
are
being
made,
it
is
to
whom
they
are
being
made,
if
they're
calling
from
your
home
or
your
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
see
that
a
minute,
mr.
attorney
general.
suppose
you
have
a
very
distinguished
physician,
lawyer,
public
servant,
whatever
but
he
has
the
vice
of
being
fascinated
with
horse
races
and
he
is
everyday
calling
and
placing
bets.
perhaps
he's
an
elective
officer
and
doesn't
want
that
known.
wouldn't
you
think
he
would
have
some
expectation
that
the
fact
he's
calling
the
bookie
once
or
twice
a
day
to
place
bets
would
be
an
entirely
private
matter?
it's
his
own
private
vice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
are
unlawful.
you're
speaking
of
a
lot
of
unlawful
things.
there's
nothing
unlawful
about
calling
a
bookie.
at
least
in
maryland
i
guess
there
isn't,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume,
the
state--
i
thought
maryland--
gambling
was
legal
in
maryland
because
you
have
horse
racing
and
i
didn't
think
horse
racing
survived
except
by
gambling,
but
let's
suppose
you've
got
a
state--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
governor
of
the
state
probably
in
a--
let's
take
utah
now
and
he's
placing
telephone
calls
to
a
bookie.
he
certainly
hopes
that's
not
going
to
be
made
known
to
a
predominantly
mormon
population
in
the
state
of
utah,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say
there's
no
reasonable
or
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
this
is
a
risk
he
takes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back,
mr.
attorney
general,
to
the
hotel
room,
i
would
assume
everyone
takes
the
risk
that
if
he
leaves
a
45-automatic
on
the
top
of
the
dresser
in
a
hotel
room
or
a
package
of
marijuana,
that
the
hotel
maid
is
under
instructions
and
is
very
likely
to
report
that
to
the
housekeeper
who'll
report
it
to
the
manager
who
will
report
it
to
the
police.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
attorney
general.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
cardin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
mr.
justice
white's
question,
when
the
telephone
company
announced
it,
you'd
be
in
the
same
situation
on
local
calls
as
you
would
on
long
distance
calls,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
