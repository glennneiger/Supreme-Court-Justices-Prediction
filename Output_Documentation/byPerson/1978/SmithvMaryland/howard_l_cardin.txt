mr.
howard
l.
cardin
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
modern
technology
brings
to
society
an
improved
standard
of
living
and
new
conveniences,
it
also
presents
a
serious
challenge
to
the
personal
rights
of
an
individual.
this
was
anticipated
many
years
ago
by
this
court
in
dissent
when,
in
a
homestead,
it
was
stated
that
solar
and
formal
reaching
means
of
invading
privacy
have
become
available
to
the
government.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
if
we
had
that
system,
then
i
believe
that
the
government,
they
staged
comparison
to
voluntarily
giving
over
information
might
well
be
founded.
i
don't
believe
it's
founded
under
circumstances
here
which
i
do
in
so
many--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
so.
modern
technology
has
now
permitted
the
telephone
company
to
give
a
better
service.
in
so
doing,
it
has
also
permitted
the
police
department
to
use
more
sophisticated
means
of
invading
privacy,
if
you
will.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
i
do
agree
with
that.
that
is
correct.
as
the
dissent
said,
the
progress--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
no,
i'm
not
agreeing
that
there
would
be
no
search.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
may
not
have
been
an
expectation
at
that
point
because
one
is
voluntarily
turning
over.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i
think
there's
the
search.
i
just
don't
think
there's
the
expectation
of
privacy.
we
don't
know,
at
least
i
don't
know,
maybe
it's
well-known,
back
in
the
olden
days
whether
the
operator
knew
what
the
originating
number
was?
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
know
that
either.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
certainly.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes.
as
i
was
indicating,
the
progress
of
science
and
furnishing
the
government
with
means
of
espionage
is
not
likely
to
stop
at
that
point
with
wiretapping.
i
think
we
will
see
many
more
advances
in
our
day.
the
case
of
michael
smith
presents
an
example
of
the
modern
technology,
if
you
will.
using
the
telephone
and
the
privacy
of
his
residence,
he
took
an
action
to
exclude
what
has
been
known
as
the
curious
ear.
he
certainly
did
not
expect
that
the
police
department,
acting
through
its
agent,
the
telephone
company,
would
seize
the
number
that
he
dialed.
and
so,
we
come
to
the
first
important
factor
that
has
to
be
considered
with
the
use
of
pen
register
devices
and
similar
type
of
devices.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
no,
i
believe
that
with
a
warrant
it
can
properly
be
done.
i
agree
it
does
not
fall
under
title
3
as
we
conceded
in
our
brief
and
i
think
it
has
well
been
decided,
but
we
believe
it
does
require
a
warrant.
the
important
factor
in
these
type
of
cases,
that
is
the
michael
smith
type
of
cases,
is
that
the
action
of
recording
these
numbers
was
initiated
by
the
police
department,
not
by
the
telephone
company
as
part
of
its
housekeeping
functions.
several
months
ago,
this
court
in
the
new
york
telephone
company
case
alluded
to
the
fact
that
the
telephone
company
admits
that
it
uses
pen
registers
to
check
bills,
detect
fraud,
and
prevent
violations
of
the
law.
in
each
of
these
instances,
they
were
housekeeping
type
functions.
i
would
ask
to
compare
the
situation.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes,
sir.
again,
but
these
are
instances
that
he
is
aware
of.
that
is,
when
he
makes
the
long
distance
phone
calls--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
he
knows
it's
not
private
when
he
makes
the
long
distance
phone
call.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
in
those
instances
where
he
has
made
a
complaint
about
a
bill
and
they
were
checking
his
bill,
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
very,
very
few
in
number.
there
are
other
occasions.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
there
are
other
occasions.
they
are
very,
very
few
in
number.
the
typical
piece
of
apparatus
used
by
the
telephone
company
is
not
the
pen
register.
it
is
a
tracing
device
which
is
placed
on
someone
else's
phone
or
the
subscriber's
phone
and
used
to
find
out
where
a
call
is
coming
from.
the
pen
register
is
used
only
in
a
very
limited
number
of
cases
by
the
telephone
company.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
no,
sir,
because
if
i
am
the
person
whose--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i
disagree
because
in
the
function
of
the
tracing
device,
the
device
is
placed
on
the
subscriber's
phone
who
has
made
the
complaint.
thereafter,
the
tracing
goes
through
the
telephone
company
itself
and
does
not
actually
reach
the
other
end
of
the
line.
it
stops
right
before
it
gets
to
the
other
end
of
the
line.
that
is--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i
think
we're
in
a
matter
of
semantics.
it
does
not
find
out
information
about
the
other
end
of
the
line,
and
that
is
the
reason
why--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
the
tracing
device
is
not
in
actuality
find
that
a
made
the
call.
that
is
the
reason
why,
in
this
particular
set
of
facts,
after
the
tracer
was
used,
a
pen
register
was
put
on
the
residence
of
michael
smith.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
well,
in
the
smith
case,
the
tracing
device
does
not
go
to
smith's
home.
that's
the
point
that
i
make.
it
went
to
a
payphone
and,
from
there,
other
investiga--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
there
are
many
persons
that
would
argue
that
it
is.
i
suggest
that
i
see
a
difference
between
the
two,
but
there
are
many
cases
and
many
persons--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes,
i
believe
so.
i
believe
so
because,
in
this
instance,
the
viewing
eye
or
the
listening
ear
is
not
coming
from
that
particular
person's
phone,
apparatus.
it
is
coming
from
someplace
else
in
a
similar,
as
i
will
get
to
more
of
the
situation
of
the
mail
covers
and
making
the
deposit
of
appellee.
i
would
suggest,
if--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i'm
sorry,
i
did
not
hear
it.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
tracing
backwards?
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
that.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i'm
sorry,
i'm
wrong
in
my
facts
about
tracing?
i
was
cert--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i
would
only
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
information--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
the
information
that
i
have
come
from
the
investigation
department,
that's
the
cmp
telephone
company
in
baltimore.
the
point
that
we
make
is
that
this
was
an
action
that
was
precipitated
by
the
police
department,
not
by
the
telephone
company.
we
compare
it
to
the
situation
of
a
housekeeper
coming
into
a
hotel
room.
on
the
one
instance,
if
she's
coming
in,
performing
her
duties,
and
comes
across
something,
that
is
one
situation.
on
the
other
hand,
if
she
is
contacted
by
the
police
department
and
said
“why
don't
you
go
into
that
room
for
us
and
see
what
is
there
because
we
suspect
something
maybe
going
on,”
then
she
is
operating
as
the
agent
of
the
police
department
and
is
not
properly
on
the
premises
at
that
time.
and,
we
believe
that
analogy
is
much
closer
than
the
analogies
that
have
been
submitted
or
suggested
by
the
state.
the
comparison,
if
you
will,
to
mail
covers
and
deposits
are
not
similar
to
the
pen
register
situation.
it
is
suggested
that
there
is
a
voluntary
turning
over
of
information
to
third
persons
when
one
turns
over
a
letter
to
a
clerk
or
when
one
makes
a
deposit
in
a
bank.
that
may
be
true,
but
there
is
not
a
voluntary
turning
over
of
information
when
one
dials
his
phone.
as
you
well
know,
going
back
to
the
long
distance
call,
in
order
to
make
that
long
distance
call,
we,
the
dialer,
press
1.
that
activates--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
well,
the
point
is
you
dial--
let
me
change
that.
you
dial
something
to
activate
the
pen
register
type
of
device.
so,
that
one
who
is
dialing
a
local
call
assumes
that
there
is
a
pen
register
device
working.
whereas,
one
who
dials
the
long
distance
call
knows
that
he
is
putting
into
operation,
maybe
not
a
pen
register,
he
may
not
know
the
term,
but
some
type
of
device
that's
going
to
record
the
number
that
he
is
dialing
so
that
he
will,
one,
be
charged
for
it
and,
number
two,
can
check
the
accuracy
of
the
phone
company's
bill.
these
are--
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
that
local
calla
and
that
long
distance
call.
when
one
then
dials
the
1
or
the
area
code,
he
is
then
voluntarily
turning
over
the
information
similar
to
the
deposit
or
to
the
mailing
of
an
envelope
or
mailing
of
a
letter
or
where
a
person
is
in
the
room
and
he
is
talking
supposedly
confidentially
to
a
third
person.
but,
before
he
activates
that
type
of
device,
he
is
not
voluntarily
turning
over
information.
i
would
like
to
get
again
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
about
the
operator.
if
the
person
were
to
call
the
operator
for
assistance
in
making
that
call,
then
he
is
obviously
voluntarily
turning
over
that
information
to
the
operator
and
takes
the
chance,
as
been
expressed,
that
that
information
may
later
be
conveyed
to
someone
else.
but,
until
he
does
that,
it
cannot
be
said
in
a
realistic
way
that
he
has
voluntarily
turned
over
that
information.
thus,
it
might
be
foreseeable
that
in
the
situation
with
a
mail
cover
or
a
deposit
that
the
information
could
be
revealed
to
law
enforcement
officers.
it
might
be
foreseeable
that
one
who
dials
a
long
distance
call,
by
activating
the
pen
register
type
of
device,
takes
the
chance
that
the
information
will
be
turned
over,
but
not
until
he
activates
that
device
is
there
any
reasonable
expectation
that
that
information
will
be
turned
over
to
anyone.
the
question
as
to
why--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
even
at
that
stage,
you
wouldn't
know
who--
where
the
number
came
from
or
emanated
from.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
if
i
dial,
your
honor--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes,
the
fact
that
the
call
was
made,
but
you
don't
know
the
number
that
it
emanated
from.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
unless
you
know
me
or
assume
where
i
came
from
or
where
i'm
going
from.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes,
i
agree
with
that,
but
i'm
saying,
unless
there
is
that
type
of
situation,
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
anyone
is
recording
the
number
that
you
dial
or
i
dial,
a
local
situation.
now,
the
third
pertinent
part
of
the
factual
situation
is
why
should
i
stand
here
and
ask
this
court
to
require
a
search
warrant
or
a
similar
type
of
court
order
prior
to
the
installation
of
such
a
device.
we
start
out
with
the
premise,
that
search
warrants
and
court
orders
are
preferred
in
any
situation
where
there
is
a
search
and
seizure.
as
we
review
every
c--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
no,
we're
talking
here
about--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i'm
sorry,
per
a
search
and
seizure
not
following
a
valid
arrest,
yes.
every
case
that
was
submitted
to
this
court
for
its
consideration--
i
take
that
back.
every
federal
case
that
was
submitted
to
this
court
for
its
consideration
had,
in
fact,
a
court
order
involved
in
it.
and,
i
believe
that
i
can
state
fairly
to
this
court
that
it
is
the
practice
in
the
federal
system
to
require
a
court
order
or
a
search
and
seizure
warrant
before
a
pen
register
is
attached.
there
is,
in
fact,
a
statement
by
professor
carr
in
his
book
on
electronic
surveillance
that
this
is
the
practice
in
the
federal
system
and
that
there
is,
certainly,
a
great
many
of
the
states
that
have
followed
the
precedent
of
the
federal
system.
the
reason,
of
course,
is
that,
with
a
warrant
we
avoid,
first,
a
general
search.
there
is
a
particularity
as
to
what
is
seized.
there
is
a--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
well,
the--
we
talk
about
average
situations.
they
are
the
abnormal
situations
also.
in
other
words,
if
we
have
an
address
and
this
address
happens
to
be
a
high
rise
apartment
house,
then
you
may
have
a
pen
register
device
placed
on
hundreds
of
phones,
hundreds
of
numbers.
so
that,
i
believe
that
there
would
be
a
requirement,
at
least--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
no,
i
think
it
will
require
the
officer,
at
least
at
that
point,
or
whoever
the
law
enforcement
officer
is,
to
proceed
with
an
investigation
to
limit
to
at
least
a
specific
phone
for
a
particular
phone
that
which
he
believes
and
has
probable
cause
to
believe
is
the
phone
number
involved.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i
agree
that
every
number
will
be
recorded.
i'm
talking
about
particularity
as
to
where
we're
going,
not
what
is
being--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i'm
talking
about
one
phone.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
the
warrant
would
provide
a
duration
as
to
how
long
the
pen
register
device
would
be
permitted
on
the
phone.
a
return
requirement
for
a
warrant
causes
the
officer
to
lose
some
of
that
discretion
as
to
how
he
will
later
use
that
information
that
is
obtained,
that
innocent
information,
if
you
will.
the
requirement
that
there'd
be
a
crime
that
either
has
been
committed
or
is
about
to
be
committed.
i
think
it's
very
important.
in
other
words,
without
some
type
of
warrant
requirement,
that
device
can
be
placed
on
a
phone
for
any
reason
for
intelligence
information,
whereas,
as
this
court
stated
in
burger
versus
new
york,
there
should
be
at
least
the
belief
that
a
crime
is
about
to
be
committed
or
it
has
been
committed.
there
is
no
such
requirement
under
the
circumstances
as
it
presently
exists.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i
believe
they
held
that
it
was
not
a
search
and
seizure.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes,
sir.
without
a
warrant
or
court
order,
there
is
no
placing
or
pinpointing
of
responsibility.
not
so
long
ago,
out
of
the
state
of
maryland,
this
court
dealt
with
the
giordano
case
and
noted
that
it
was
important
that
application
be
made
by
certain
persons
who
were
designated
so
that
there
could
be
responsibility,
there
could
be
supervision
as
to
the
actions
taken
without--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i
understand
that
and
i
believe
that
the
statute
contained
that
specific
point,
as
this
court
stated,
in
order
to
assure
that
we
knew
who
was
responsible
for
the
application,
who
was--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
there
is
no
litigation--
i'm
sorry,
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
the
fact
that
the
court
held
that
that
particular
provision,
the
wire
tap
statute,
had
to
be
complied
with
strictly
would
indicate
that
this
was
a
very
important
part
of
that
statute
and
one
which
could
not
be
accomplished
by
substantial
compliance.
what
we're
saying
here
is
to
allow
an
officer
on
his
own,
we
don't
even
know
who
the
officer
might
be,
whether
he
has
investigative
background,
whether
he
is
high
or
low
within
the
police
department,
but
to
allow
anyone
just
to
go
ahead
and
place
the
pen
register
would
be
wrong.
that
there
should
be
some
pinpointing
of
responsibility,
and
the
only
way
we
can
do
it
is
to
require
that
there'd
be
a
court
order.
as
such,
there
is
an
accountability,
there
is
supervision.
without
it,
there
is
complete
decentralization,
and
decentralization
leads
to
abuse.
the
failure
to
require
that
a
warrant
or
court
order
be
obtained
prior
to
the
installation
of
a
pen
register
can
also
have
a
far-reaching
effect
in
destroying
one's
personal
rights.
as
indicated
in
the
brief,
as
we
describe
it
as
a
chewing
effect
on
freedom
of
speech
and
association,
one
cannot
necessarily
speak
for
another
as
to
why
or
why
not
he
does
things
but
the
fact
that
it
would
be
common
knowledge
or
could
be
common
knowledge
to
any
investigating
officer
whom
we
spoke
to,
whom
he
dialed
may
well
place
a
chewing
effect
on
one's
freedom
of
speech
and,
as
an
adjunct
to
that,
freedom
of
association.
there
is
a
strong
possibility
of
abuse
by
law
enforcement
officers
of
this
type
of
device.
the
fact
and
the
possibility
of
illegal
wire
taps,
as
a
simple
adjunct
to
this
device,
is--
has
been
discussed
and
is
discussed
in
the
brief.
the
use
of
the
information
by
an
irresponsible
officer
can
cause
the
innocent
to
suffer.
it
can
cause
intimidation
of
persons.
it
can
be
used
for
ver--
many,
many
purposes
not
consistent
with
the
investigation.

mr.
howard
l.

a
photograph,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
if
i
might--
i'm
sorry.
let
me
go
back
a
little
bit.
after
the
pen
register
was
affixed
and
a
call
to
the
robbery
victim's
home
was
found
to
be
at
the
same
time
as
the
number
to
the
robbery
victim's
home
was
punched
out
on
the
pen
register,
the
police
department
or
the
police
officer
went
to--
upon
receipt
of
police
department
files,
obtained
a
photograph
of
smith,
took
that
photograph
along
with
others
to
the
victim
who
identified
that
photograph.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes,
it
was.
and,
there
was
a
stipulation
that
without
the
first
step,
that
is
the
attachment
of
the
pen
register,
and
obtaining
of
michael
lee
smith
that
way,
that
the
photograph
would
never
have
been
obtained
and,
as
such,
he
would
never
have
been
identified.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
mr.
justice
stewart,
my--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
at
the
trial
of
the
case
it
was
stipulated,
as
i
say,
that
he,
that
is
the
accused,
michael
lee
smith,
would
never
have
been
identified
unless
this
device
was
used.
that
is
the
derivative
use
of
this
particular
device
was
to
identify
my
client.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
and
then
it
resulted
his
being
identified.
otherwise,
he
would
never
have
been
identified.
there
would
never
have
been
a
warrant
for
his
arrest.
without
that,
there
would
never
been
a
pinpointing
of
michael
lee
smith
to
be
charged
with
this
particular
common
law
robbery.
failure
to
require
the
court
order
or
warrant
may
lead
to
an
indiscriminant
use
of
the
pen
register.
as
i
indicated,
anyone,
any
law
enforcement
officer
could
obtain
this
device.
the
state,
in
its
brief
on
page
14,
suggests
that
a
pen
register
should
be
allowed
in
cases
where
suppression--
i'm
sorry,
where
suspicion
exists.
what
suspicion?
whose
suspicion?
a
search
and
seizure
based
on
suspicion
is
contrary
to
our
constitution.
it
is
this,
that
theory,
which
we
seek
to
avoid.
i'll
ask
to
reserve
the
few
moments
that
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i
would
only
point
out,
going
back
to
where
example
of
the
hotel
room,
that
in
the
instance
where
the
housekeeper
turns
over
information,
and
we
accept
that
as
being
proper,
we
don't
have
that
situation
here
where
the
pen
register
is
attached
not
by
the
telephone
company
for
its
housekeeping
purposes
but
by
the
police
department
for
its
investigative
purposes.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
that
is
correct.
the
lines
are
owned
by
the
company.
i
believe
that
it
is
suggested
that
the--
a
portion
of
the
lines
are,
in
effect,
lease
to
the
subscriber.
that
is
his
use
is,
in
a
sense,
a
lease
or
a
renting
of
the
line.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i
would
close
by
stating,
briefly
from
burger,
this
is
no
formality
that
we
require
today
but
a
fundamental
role
that
has
long
been
recognized
as
basic
to
the
privacy
of
every
home
in
america
while
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
are
not
inflexible
or
obtusely
unyielding
to
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement.
it
is
not
asking
too
much
that
officers
be
required
to
comply
with
the
basic
command
of
the
fourth
commandment
before
the
innermost
secrets
of
one's
home
or
office
are
invaded.
the--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
if
the
telephone--
let
me
respond
by
saying
this.
i
think
the
telephone
company
has
in
fact
done
that
as
far
as
long
distance
calls
are
concerned.
i
think
we
all
recognize
that--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
then
there
is
no
expectation
of
the
privacy
but,
now,
the
way
that
it
is
done,
i
believe
that
one
expects
when
he
dials
that
local
number--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i'm
suggesting
that
there's
really
nobody
listening
to
that
local
line.
there's
nobody
listening
to
that
number
that
is
being
dialed
unless
and
until
that--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
it
certainly
doesn't
do
it
now,
at
least
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
yes.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
no
intrusion,
physical
intrusion.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
well,
there's
no
intrusion
as
such,
right.
after
the
telephone
company
announces
what
it
is
going
to
do--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
and
the
time,
i
believe
it
punches
out
the
time.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
the
number
called
and
the
time
that
the
call
was
made.
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
i
believe
that
in--
mr.
howard
l.
cardin
the
new
york
telephone
company
case,
it
was
indicated
that
the
government
pays
for
the
attachment
of
the
device,
yes.
and
so,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
in
conclusion
that
i
personally
see
no
reason
why
this
officer
in
this
case
could
not
and
should
not
have
applied
for
a
court
order,
and
i
believe
that
the
precedent
has
been
set
in
the
federal
courts
of
following
that
precedent
is
one
that
should
be
adopted.
thank
you.
