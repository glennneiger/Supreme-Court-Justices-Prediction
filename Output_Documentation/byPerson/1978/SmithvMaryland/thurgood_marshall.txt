well,
wouldn't
the
average
subscribers
due
to
know
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
if
it's
not
asked,
it's
not
private.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
he
knows
it's
not
private
locally
that,
at
the
time,
the
phone
company
will
cut
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
are
occasions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
all
these
different
things?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
tracing
and
all
of
these
different
things?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
because
you're
wrong
on
your
facts
about
the
eye
spring.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
pause
up
to
the
form
and
you
get
back
the
exact
number
of
the
phone
that
was
called,
where
it's
located,
who
it's
register
to,
etcetera.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
stick
with
the
record
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
not
talking
about
hundreds
of
phones.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
we
thought
a
tall
building
with
hundreds
of
phones.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
know
the
cost
to
that,
you--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
the
phone
company
wouldn't
be
subject
to
suit
if
they
were--
gave
that
information
to
a
third
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
phone
company--
the
police
officer
is
going
to
also
get
unlisted
phones,
too.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
why
that
makes
it
legal
just
because
the
police
officer
can
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
you
need
all
of
this
for
your
argument.
excuse
me,
i
couldn't--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
sorry.
i
apologize.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
used
to
convict
me
and
put
me
in
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
a
lot
different
from
a
pork
chop.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there's
no
intrusion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
any
kind,
because
it's
what
comes
out
of
the
house
not
what
goes
in
the
house.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
what--
when
the
telephone
company
puts
the
pen
register
on,
all
that
monitor
is
what
comes
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
only
thing
it
monitor
is
the
dig-dig-dig-dig.
that's
all,
nothing
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
number
called,
the
dig-dig-dig-dig.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
now,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
who
pays
for
this?
the
government
pays
for
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
if
