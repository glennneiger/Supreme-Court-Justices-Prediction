justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
actually,
your
client
will
be
a
lot
better
off
if
we
still
had
the
system
where
the
operator
answered
when
you
picked
up
the
phone
and
said
“number
please,”
wouldn't
it--
wouldn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
modern
technology
is
actually
improving
the
position
of
your
client
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
one
of
your
arguments
that
under
mo--
under
the
modern
technology,
whereby
local
calls
simply
are
not
monitored
by
the
telephone
company,
there
is
an
expectation
of
privacy
because
nobody
except
the
caller
knows
and
under
the
old
technology,
whereby
the
telephone
company
operator
asked
you
for
your
number,
you
knew
that
you
were
telling
the
third
party
what
the
number
was.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
depends
on
what
state
you're
in,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
in
the
state
of
virginia,
for
example,
you
don't.
you
have
to
dial
the
area
code,
but
you
don't
dial
1.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
true
in
the
case
of
an
arrest,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
it's
search
or
seizure.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
cardin,
did
your
court
of
appeals
hold
that
this
was
a
search
and
seizure
but
didn't
require
a
warrant
or
that
it
was
not
a
search
and
seizure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
talking
about--
if
you're
comparing
the
necessity
of
a
warrant
to
doing
it
simply
on
probable
cause
without
a
warrant,
i
take
it,
that
has
no
applicability
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
were
designated
by
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
state
of
maryland
could
provide
by
similar
statute
that
warrants
could
only
issue
under
terms
of
that
statute.
it
hasn't
done
so
here,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
what's
giordano
got
to
do
with
its
statutory
requirements
about
the--
with
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
true
of
a
distinguished
physician
who
commits
statutory
rape,
too,
i
suppose
with
the
implicit
assumption
that
his
victim
would
not
inform
on
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
attached
to
telephone
company
property,
isn't
it?
it
isn't
attached
to
the
defendant's
property.
it's
attached
to
the
telephone
company's
lines.
