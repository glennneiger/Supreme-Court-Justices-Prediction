justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cardin,
in
agreeing
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
are
you
saying
in
effect
that
you
would
agree
there
would've
been
no
search
in
the
olden
days,
let's
call
it,
my
kids
like
to
refer
to
it,
when--
if
it
sat--
if
a
police
officer
had
sat
to
the
operator
and
broke
down
all
the
numbers
that
from
a--
when
a
particular--
it
said,
“every
time
number
so-and-so
calls,
i'd
like
to
know
who
they're
calling,”
and
he
just
sat
there
and
wrote
down
the
numbers
they
would
call.
there'd
be
no
search
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then,
if
there's
no
expectation
of
privacy,
there's
no--
well,
at
least
there's
no--
at
least,
no
fourth
amendment
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cardin,
do
you
think
the
police
need
a
warrant
to
use
a
tracing
device?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you're
going
to
find
out
where--
you're
going
to
find
out
where
the
call
came
from
and
invade
that
person's
privacy,
aren't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
obtains
information
about
the
other
end
of
the
line
without
the
knowledge
of
the
person
at
the
other
end
of
the
line.
justice
john
paul
stevens
certainly
and
it
defines,
say,
a
calls
b.
you
put
the
device
in
b's
phone.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
find
out
that
a
made
the
call
and
a
didn't
expect
you
to
find
that
out.
why
isn't
that
a
precisely
the
same
invasion
of
a's
privacy
as
if
you
put
it
on
a's
phone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
until
after
they
found
out
that
a
call
originated
from
michael
smith's
phone,
which
they
found
out
by
putting
a
tracing
device
on
b's
phone
and
finding
out
that
a
called
and
originated
from
a's
phone.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
for
purposes
of
my
question,
couldn't
a--
if
it
had
gone
directly
to
a's
home
and
you,
thereafter,
put
it.
why
isn't
the
tracing
device
just
as
much
an
invasion
of
privacy
as
the
pen
register?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
terms
of
expectation
of
privacy,
is
there
a
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cardin,
how
can
there
be
particularity?
you
put
the
device
on.
it's
on
24
hours
a
day,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
grants
the
probable--
on
basis
of
probable
cause,
find
that
hundreds
of
numbers
are
probable
engaged
in
violation
of
the
law
and,
therefore,
they're
all
subject
to
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
particularity
then
means
limited
to
one
phone,
not
to
what
can
be
done
to
that
phone.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.--
general
sachs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
do
with
your
opponent's
example
of
a
maid
in
a
hotel
room?
you
certainly
have
an
anticipation
that
a
third
party
will
be
in
the
room
which
don't
expect
the
police
to
come
in.
