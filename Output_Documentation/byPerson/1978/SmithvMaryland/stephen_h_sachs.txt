mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin,
if
i
may,
by
indicating
to
the
court
what
the
pen
register
is
not.
i
think,
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
know
something
about
that
from
this
court's
definition
in
giordano
and
new
york
telephone.
we
know
something
about
it
from
the
court's
fairly
dote
discussion
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
hodge
case.
we
know
about
it
from
a
various
lower
view
articles
that
have
appeared
in
the--
cited
in
the
briefs.
we
know
even
on
this
sparse
record,
that
the
telephone
company
representative
who
testified
at
the--
at
a
hearing
in
these
proceedings
referred
to
the
pen
register
as
a
normal
and--
normal
telephone
equipment
is
what
he
called
it.
but,
the
point
i'd
like
to
make,
your
honors,
is
that
it
hears
no
sound.
it
captures
no
words
uttered
into
the
mouth
piece,
as
this
court
phrased
it
in
katz.
it
captures
no
content.
it
achieves
no
communication,
other
than
the
limited
communication
between
the
user
and
the
phone
company
itself.
it
has
been
defined
by
congress,
indeed,
by
its
exclusion
from
the
requirements
of
title
3
as
not
to
be
a
communication.
it
doesn't
disclose
if
the
call
is
completed.
it
doesn't
reveal
who
the
caller
is.
it
doesn't
say
if
the
number
was
busy.
it
doesn't
say
who
the
parties
are
and
it
doesn't
tell
the
duration
of
the
call.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
that
is
precisely
what
we're
contending,
your
honor.
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
and
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that,
in
a
great
many
cases,
although
it's
improvable,
inherently,
there
is
frequently
not
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy.
the
user
of
a
telephone
knows
to
go
back
to
the
days,
however
long
ago
they
may
be,
to
go
back
to
the
days
when
this
was
not
done
mechanically
but
done
by
human
communication.
one
said
to
the
operator
millie,
“millie,
get
me
george”
or
“get
me
sam,
down
at
the
grocery
store.”
all
that's
done
now,
your
honor,
is
that
we
communicate
and
impart
that
information,
the
number
we
wish
to
achieve,
to
a
phone
company
who
has--
who
is
not
statutory
barred
from
disclosing
that
information
to
third
parties,
unlike
communication
between
the
party
calling
and
the
party
called.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
in
the
hodge
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
held
not
to
be
subject
to
suit.
the
phone
company
is
at
liberty
to
give
that
information
to
a
third
party,
at
least
a
lawful
authority
which
is
all
i
need
to
contend
for
in
this
case.
well,
all
i
need
to
contend
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
lawful
authority
without
warrant,
but
police
officers
inquiring
are
at
liberty
to
achieve
from
the
phone
company
and
the
phone
company
would
be,
and
has
been
so
held--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
that
raises
perhaps
a
different
question,
your
honor.
it's
certainly
a
different
question--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
but
the
question
i'm
addressing
myself
to,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
whether--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
i
was
trying
to
respond
to
the
chief
justice,
but--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
my
point,
sir,
is
that
the
user
of
a
telephone
has
no
reasonable
expectation
that
the
information
he
imparts
to
the
company
as
to
the
number
he
wishes
to
achieve
will
not
be
imparted
to
other
persons.
he
knows
that
every
month
he
gets
the
long
distance
calls
he
dials.
he
knows
that,
in
many
parts
of
the
country,
telephones
are
subject
to
separate
racially
structures
so
that,
for
billing
purposes,
the
phone
company
needs
to
know
how
many
calls
on
a
certain--
for
certain
purposes
are
used.
he
knows
that
the
telephone
companies
in
the
business
of
protecting
its
own
tariffs
and
its
own
customers
by
investigating
complaints
of
annoying
and
obscene
telephone
calls.
he
knows
all
those
things.
he
has
code
in
his
phonebook,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
every
phonebook
in
this
nation,
he
knows.
and,
i
have--
i
don't
think
i
stray
very
far
from
the
record
in
this
case
in
reading
to
you
what
the
phonebook
says
and
what
it
says,
at
least
in
washington,
d.c.,
is
that
we
have
employees
who
are
trained
to
assist
and
advice
you
and
who
can
frequently
help
in
identifying
to
the
authorities
the
origin
of
unwelcomed
and
troublesome
calls.
so,
for
all
those
reasons,
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
average
telephone
user
probably
ought
not
have
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
as
to
the
number
called
but,
in
any
case,
it's
not
an
expectation
that
will
be
recognized
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
your
honor,
in
almost
every
case
in
which
evidence
that
has
been
obtained
surreptitiously,
whether
within
the
warrant
requirement
or
without
the
warrant
requirement,
there
has
been
a
subjective
expectation
by
the
defendant
who
arrives
in
the
case
having
had
his
confidence
betrayed.
so,
in
that
sense,
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
yes,
everyone
who
gets
caught
took
a
risk
and
lost.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
it
was
true
of
mr.
hoffa.
it
was
true
of
mr.
osborne.
it
was
true
of
mr.
lewis.
it
was
true
of
mr.
lopez.
it
was
true
of
lee.
it
was
true
of
white.
it
has
been
true
in
all
the
misplaced
confidence
cases.
it
was
true
presumably
of
the
user
of
the
bank
in
miller.
it
is
true
of
someone
who
corresponds
to
the
mails
who
doesn't
expect
mail
covers
to
be
used.
it
is
true
of
people
who
have
marijuana
in
their
suitcases
but
dogs
smell
it
and
he's
apprehended
that
way.
it
is
true
in
people
who--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
it
is,
the
last
time
i
looked,
unlawful.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
there's
a
difference,
if
i
may
say
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
perhaps
between
the
bookie
who
is
not
regulated
by
the
state
and,
thus,
unlawful
and
the
lottery
location
which
is
regulated
by
the
state
and
is
lawful.
aside
from
that,
there
may
not
be
any
difference.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
i'm
sure
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
one--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
that
it's
a
risk
that
he
takes
and
it's
the
kind
of
risk
that
this
court
has
sanctioned
in
a
great
many
cases.
this
court
sanctioned
the
risk
in
all
the
cases
that
i've
already
mentioned
that
when
you
confide
in
a
friend,
a
trusted
confidant,
you
run
the
risk
that
person
either
will
later
go
to
the
authorities
or
has
been
an
undercover
agent
all
the
time.
among
the
balances
or--
i
shouldn't
say
balances,
but
among
the
list
of
tests
to
test
the
one
legal
question
worth
asking
in
this
case,
namely,
is
there
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
communication
of
the
numbers
dialed,
among
them
is,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
the
assumption
of
the
risk.
among
them
is
the
extent
of
the
intrusion.
among
them
is
whether
thought,
words,
communication,
in
the
normal
sense,
is
captured.
and,
it's
our--
it's
the
state's
position
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
that
both
factually
and
legally
this
case
falls
well
on
the
safe
side
of
the
frontiers
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
don't
blush
to
say
to
the
court
that
there's
a
sense
in
which
this
case,
both
doctrinally
and
factually,
has
already
been
decided
by
this
court.
it's
a
kind
of
a
backwater
factually
and
legally.
if
i
may
echo
what
mr.
justice
rehnquist
said
a
few
moments
ago,
it
is
really
ironic
that
what
we're
testing
here
is
a--
is
something
as
to
which,
over
the
years,
there
has
been
increased
factual
privacy
because
the
average
phone
user
probably
does
have
in
fact
more
privacy
than
he
or
she
did
50
years
ago
when
the
phone
was
first
used.
and,
the
specter
of
electronic
surveillance
that
is
injected
into
the
case
by
the
petitioner,
seems
to
me,
is
misplaced
because
what
we
have
here
is
really
a
phone
company
mechanism
that
is
very
much
a
part
of
their
normal
and
routine
operations
which
people
understand
and
know
are
likely
to
be
at
any
given
moment,
for
lots
of
different
reasons,
breached
by
the
phone
company
or
the
phone
company
which
may
then
go
to
lawful
authorities.
it's
the
state's
position,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
that
the
communication
made
here
to
the
phone
company
of
the
numbers
dialed
is
a
business
communication
to
a
company
which
has
every
reason
in
the
world
to
record
and,
on
occasion,
reveal
that
information.
and,
it
is
no
kind
of
communication
nor
the
circumstances--
the
kind
of
circumstances,
that
this
court
in
any
of
its
prior
rulings
has
said
it
has
faced
against.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
yes?
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
that's
true,
your
honor.
the
stoner
case,
i
think,
this
court
distinguishes
the
hotel
situation
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that,
in
a
hotel
situation,
the
hiring
of
the
hotel
room
does
not
expect
that
the
full
search
from
police
officers
without
a
warrant
will
take
place.
it
is
very
different,
we
suggest,
than
the
communication
out
from
that
hotel
room
or
from
one's
home
on
leased
lines
of
a
company
which
is
not
your
own,
on
equipment
which
is
not
your
own,
of
a
communication
much
like
calling
the
plumber
and
saying
“i
have
water
in
my
cellar,
please
come.”
that
plumber
can,
if
he
wishes,
tell
the
police
“sachs
has
water
in
his
cellar.”
the
call
out
from
your
hotel
room
to
the
butcher
that
says
“i
want
three
pork
chops”
could
be
revealed
to
the
police,
“sachs
want
three
pork
chops.”
in
the
same
sense,
when
i
say
“i
want
4666187”
to
the
phone
company,
i
run
the
risk,
we
say
the
legitimate
risk,
that
that
information
may
be
communicated
to
the
police.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
your
honor--
[attempt
to
laughter]]
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
the
answer
to
that
is,
yes,
your
honor.
you're
right.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
yes,
your
honor,
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
there
are
some
cases--
to
return
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
inquiry,
there
are
some
cases
which
do
recognize
a
limited
kind
of
privilege
here.
that
taxicab--
rios,
i
think,
was
a
taxicab
case
which
recognizes
that,
for
some
time
and
for
some
purposes--
you
may
relinquish
your
privacy
for
some
purposes
but
not
for
all.
and,
i'm--
i
certainly
concede
it
as--
concede
i
must,
that
the
hotel
room
may
well
fall
into
that
category,
but
it
is
an
intrusion
by
the
police
into
the
room.
it
has
the
general
aspects
of
a
generalized
search
of
everything
in
that
room
and
i
think,
as
we
know
from
rakas
and
as
we
know
from
other
recent
cases
of
this
court,
we
have
not
abandoned
property
concepts
altogether
when
we
analyze
the
katz
expectation
test.
so,
i
think
that's
the
distinction,
mr.
justice,
that
i
would
draw
between
that
and
this.
in
some--mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
say
that,
as
three
circuits
have
recognized:
the
ninth,
the
fifth,
and
the
first,
the--
as
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
recognized
by
not
including
into
title
3
the
pen
register
and
as
this
court
has
come
very
close
already
to
recognizing
by
recognizing
in
new
york
telephone
that
the
pen
register
is
a
far
lesser
intrusion
than
the
wiretap,
for
those
reasons
and
the
sound
application
of
the
fourth
amendment,
we
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
thank
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
