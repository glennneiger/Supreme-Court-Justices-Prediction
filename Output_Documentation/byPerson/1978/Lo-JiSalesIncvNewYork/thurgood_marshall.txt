suppose
after
this
case
is
over,
the
same
two
policemen
go
in
and
buy
two
film,
could
he
be
prosecuted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
two
policemen
go
in
and
buy
two
more
films?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
be
prosecuted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said,
they
give
to
this
any
magistrate,
i
don't
have
to
--
any
magistrate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
why
is
the
original
seizure
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
we
had
it
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
two
policemen
brought
in
two
films
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
and
said
we
want
action
to
magistrate.
and
you
said
that
is
gone.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
do
i
misquote
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
on
the
record
of
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
count
stand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
of
the?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happen
after
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
now
if
it's
done
afterwards,
it's
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
want
another
difference
between
pro
and
after.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
cleans
the
whole
slate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
clean
the
whole
prior
slate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
didn't
it
clean
the
future
slate?
why
is
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
convicted,
was
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
your
honor,
he
was
convicted
but
that
is
this
case.
what
happened
--
what
happened
here
your
honor
was
that
after
having
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
the
example
can
see
that
you
have
made
a
very
good
argument
for
action
for
damages.
but
i
couldn't
see
necessarily
that
that
was
a
defense
in
lawsuit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
straighten
me
up.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
real
difference
between
a
customer
and
a
policeman
is
the
customized
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
the
real
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
customer
buys
something
and
pays
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
you
said
it
is
law
but
it
is
not
but
it
is
warning.
the
policeman
implied
(inaudible)
while
in
there
place,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean
when
the
others
went
in
with
the
magistrate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
nobody
then
--
isn't
that
the
real
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
judicial
officer
at
the
--
spent
six
hours
in
there,
was
he
still
a
judicial
officer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
was
he
a
bias
person?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
to
be
in
there
looking
at
the
material
for
six
hours,
wouldn't
he
be
influenced
one
way
of
the
other?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
he
be
influenced
one
or
another?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
had
a
hearing
who
decide
over
the
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wasn't
it,
wasn't
it
testimony
that
he
wasn't
free
to
leave,
he
was
under
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
you
moved
freely
throughout
the
store?
doesn't
that
mean,
you're
not
free
to
move
outside?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
there
was
a
seizure
when
they
walked
in
there,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
need
11
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
he
a
rough
man
or
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
these
weren't
people.
these
were
police.
they
are
different
from
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
different
from
the
average
person.
one
is
they
have
a
gun.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
different
from
--
do
you
have
a
gun?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
different,
isn't
it?
well,
when
you
send
11
police
in
there,
you
say
isn't
that
seizure?
i
wonder
what
is
it,
a
visit?
a
friendly
visit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
the
things
that
they
put
together
for
the
judge
were
they
seized?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
were
they,
detained?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
put
it
--
could
the
owner
take
them
away
from
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
be
big
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
big
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
that
be
that
there
were
no
duplicate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
it
be
that
there
weren't
any
duplicates?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
didn't
more
able
to
seize,
it
wouldn't
matter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
now
you
have
$22,000.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
took
him
six
hours,
didn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
guess
if
it
was
only
one,
it
would
be
a
couple
of
days,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happened
to
business
records?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
they
didn't
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
they
were
not
in
the
public
area,
were
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
mean
you
said
everything
was
out
in
the
public
area
but
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
--
but
they
did
go
into
the
private
area?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
right
did
they
have
behind
the
camera?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
understand
that
the
man
you
said
the
only
thing
they
did
and
the
only
place
they
went
was
to
ride
a
public
land?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
you
admit
they
did
go
to
some
place
that
the
public
didn't
go.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
public
didn't
go
behind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you'd
be
inconvenienced?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
would
be
inconvenienced?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
means
for
prosecution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
you'd
be
inconvenienced.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
state
of
new
york,
is
there
any
other
procedure
that
allows
the
magistrate
to
do
what
was
done
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
got
a
bucket
shop
running,
can
the
magistrate
go
into
the
bucket
shop
and
open
up
all
the
books
and
look
at
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
booking
shop,
i
said
bucket
shop.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
where
you
sell
stocks
and
bonds
over
the
telephone.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
go
in
there.
is
there
any
other
place
that
you
can
go
in
like
this
other
than
a
pornographic
store?
justice
thurgood
marshall
give
me
one
then.
let
me
see
which
one
has
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
example
you
wouldn't
go
in
your
racetrack
in
goshen
and
do
that,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
goshen,
you
wouldn't
in
that
racetrack
and
go
in
there
and
seize
all
that
books,
would
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
there
were
selling
dirty
books?
justice

marshall

other
thing?

the
world.

thurgood
marshall
