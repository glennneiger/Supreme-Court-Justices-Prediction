mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
a
multitude
of
reasons
why
the
search
and
seizures
in
this
case
are
constitutionally
tainted.
any
one
of
them
ought
to
be
sufficient
to
require
the
reversal
of
the
conviction
below.
first
of
all,
the
warrant
under
which
the
search
was
conducted
was
invalid
both
because
it
was
issued
without
probable
cause
and
because
it
failed
to
identify
with
particularity
the
items
which
were
to
be
seized.
second
of
all,
the
search
was
an
exploratory,
limitless,
general
search.
third,
the
magistrate
failed
to
focus
searchingly
on
the
obscenity
of
the
seized
items
before
seizure.
and
fourth,
because
the
seizure
was
so
general
so
pervasive,
so
massive,
it
affected
a
restraint
which
required
an
adversary
hearing
on
the
question
of
obscenity
in
advance
of
seizure.
we
contend
that
the
presence
of
the
magistrate
on
the
premises
not
only
failed
to
cure
the
constitutional
violations
but
actually
intensified
them
and
we
urge
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
petitioner
against
the
general
search
and
mass
seizure
which
took
place
here.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
the
state
went
about
handling
it
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
entry
onto
the
premises
assuming
no
further
rights
than
any
customer
might
have
the
purchase
or
the
observation
of
material
which
would
not
involve
the
authorization
of
an
invalid
warrant
to
search
and
to
seize
and
without
the
massive
seizure
that
took
place
here.
it
might
be
an
acceptable
way
of
dealing
with
the
situation.
heller,
i
think
demonstrates
a
manner
in
which
this
court
has
held
the
seizure
of
material
after
a
careful
focusing
upon
the
entirety
of
the
materials
involved
was
done
and
handled
apparently
properly
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
as
i
read
your
decision
in
heller,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
might
have
been
appropriate
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
ways
in
which
a
prosecution
---
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
seems
to
me
there
are
a
number
of
other
ways
in
which
a
criminal
prosecution
might
originated.
it
might
be
that
some
citizen
might
make
a
purchase
which
he
regards
to
be
inappropriate
and
seeks
a
law
enforcement.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
has
myriads
of
ways
without
violating
both
the
first,
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
in
which
they
might
appropriately
deal
with
the
question
of
obscenity.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
your
honor,
there
are
a
couple
of
things
wrong
with
the
position
which
has
been
taken
by
the
state
of
new
york.
one
is,
in
our
judgment
the
seizure
was
accomplished
before
the
magistrate
did
anything.
the
seizure
was
accomplished
when
11
representatives
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
went
upon
the
premises,
some
of
them
in
uniform
filtered
throughout
the
store,
manned
themselves
in
front
of
the
entrance,
took
the
names
and
otherwise
intimidated
persons
who
might
have
entered
the
store,
kept
the
place
under
a
virtual
siege
for
approximately
six
hours,
ransacked
the
entire
premises,
took
out
all
of
the
films
that
were
in
the
premises,
took
out
all
of
the
projectors
that
were
in
the
premises
not
only
took
out
certain
articles
of
clothing
which
apparently
had
certain
sexual
connotations
but
also
took
the
mannequins
upon
which
they
were
displayed
and
either
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
seizure
was
effected
at
the
time
that
they
encircle
and
laid
siege
to
that
little
bookstore.
that
was
when
it
occurred,
and
occurred
before
the
judge
even
had
the
opportunity
to
focus
search
on
anything.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
only
say
your
honor,
that
if
that
may
well
be
true,
but
the
problem
is
that
when
somebody
who
appears
to
be
a
magistrate
or
judge
and
someone
to
whom
in
ordinary
citizen
might
go
for
constitutional
relief
actually
appears
on
the
scene
as
an
executing
officer
and
to
a
warrant
which
he
himself
has
issued
you
have
problems
of
perhaps
and
even
more
serious
kind
when
he
goes
beyond
the
role
that
the
judge
assumed
in
the
heller
case
by
merely
going
on
to
the
scene
viewing
the
material
and
not
exercising
his
prerogative
as
an
authority
to
make
such
a
search.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
your
honor,
i
think
the
facts
would
depend
on
each
particular
circumstance.
i
think
that
a
massive
number
of
law
enforcement
authorities
made
themselves
be
an
intimidating
and
controlling
factor.
in
this
situation,
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
think
that
if
they
make
a
purchase
and
if
they
act
in
--
with
no
greater
act
then
a
customer
might,
then
that
might
be
appropriate.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
possible
under
certain
facts
for
a
large
number
of
people
to
actually
take
over
and
effectuate
the
seizure
of
the
entire
store
by
their
presence
and
control
and
domination
of
the
place
before
they
have
an
opportunity
to
take
anything
back
to
a
magistrate
and
under
those
circumstances,
you
might
have
a
seizure
which
is
premature
under
the
circumstances
that
you
suggest.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
entire
search
has
got
to
be
looked
at
under
circumstances
in
which
the
entirety
is
considered.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
but
your
honor,
there
were
other
copies
of
the
same
film
which
were
actually
acquired
during
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
your
honor,
and
i'm
suggesting
that
there
were
additional
copies
of
those
very
same
films
seized
in
the
raid
which
of
which
we
complained.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
would
urge
not
mr.
justice
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
have
a
massive
seizure
then
there
is
no
deterrent
or
prophylactic
effect
at
all
if
you
merely
invalidate
that
part
of
it
which
is
--
which
goes
beyond
the
appropriateness.
because
what
happens
then
is
that
the
police
officers
are
unnoticed
that
if
they
exceed
the
bounds
of
the
first
and
fourth
amendment
and
in
this
instance
with
respect
to
the
state
as
applied
to
through
the
fourteenth
then
all
that
will
happen
in
the
event
that
it
turns
out
that
they
have
been
excessive
in
their
zeal
is
that
that
portion
of
the
material
which
has
exceeded
will
be
returned
but
the
original
invasion,
the
original
violation
of
the
constitutional
provisions
will
still
have
not
been
remedied.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
two
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
two
more
films.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
those
films
are
then
focused
searchingly
on
by
a
detached
and
neutral
magistrate,
then
perhaps
that
might
go
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
there
has
to
be
an
arrangement
in
which
there
is
a
focusing
upon
the
material
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
in
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
the
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
if
that
is
subjected
to
a
judicial
scrutiny
which
passes
constitutional
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
it
seems
to
me
that
it
cannot,
your
honor.
because
it
is
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
because
it
is
a
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
it
is
all
partial
of
the
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
it
may
be
if
assuming
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
when
you
have
a
mass
seizure
such
as
took
place
here,
my
understanding
of
the
teaching
of
the
cases
here
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
it
seems
--
yes,
sir,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
think
that
this
case
has
to
stand
on
its
own,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that's
quite
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
your
honor,
quite
right.
they
were
--
they
were
evidence
which
is
already
available
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
pardon?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
of
course
it
was
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
purpose
that
there
could
have
been
for
seizing
multiple
copies
of
that
film
and
for
seizing
other
things
in
the
store
was
to
actually
close
the
operation,
prevent
the
exhibition
and
to
block
distribution
of
materials
without
a
prior
adjudication.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
in
our
judgment,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
record
demonstrates.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
your
honor,
it
seems
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
it
seems
to
me
first
of
all
that
in
this
case,
there
was
a
search
and
seizure
which
followed
the
purchase
of
two
films.
those
two
films
dealt
with
only
one
count.
there
were
three
counts
upon
which
a
conviction
was
obtained
based
upon
the
refusal
of
the
court
below
to
grant
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence
because
over
400
films
appear
in
count
i
which
involves
a
material
which
was
taken
solely
as
a
result
of
what
we
contend
was
a
defective
warrant
and
a
massive
search
and
seizure
and
with
respect
to
the
third
count,
that
involves
the
seizure
of
all
the
projectors
and
a
number
of
other
items,
none
of
which
were
in
the
possession
of
the
police
officers
prior
to
the
search.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
with
respect
to
the
films
that
were
involved
in
count
ii,
there
were
a
multitude
of
films
which
were
involved
apart
from
the
two
which
had
originally
been
seized
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
multiple
copies
of
those
two
had
been
seized
as
a
result
of
the
certain
seizure
and
so
it
is
our
contention
that
the
bulk
of,
the
basis
of
the
prosecutions
on
all
the
counts
came
as
a
result
of
what
we
contend
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
the
conviction
occurred
after
the
motion
to
suppress
was
denied
and
the
parties
pleaded
guilty.
under
new
york
procedure,
it
is
possible
to
seek
appellate
review
of
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
suppress
even
after
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
your
honor,
count
ii
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
--
count
ii
rests
on
those
two
films
plus
hundreds
of
others.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
and
so
consequently,
we
are
saying
that
those
are
among
them
but
it
may
well
be
that
those
that
were
taken
were
the
ones
upon
which
the
conviction
was
based
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
inseverable.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
yes,
it
is
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
because
the
count
itself
for
reasons
which
i
do
not
know
and
which
were
based
upon
determinations
of
the
law
enforcement
authorities
of
new
york.
they
included
in
one
count,
not
only
the
two
films
which
were
purchased
but
also
hundreds
of
others.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
the
guilty
plea
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
they
were
identified
in
the
seizure
materials.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
we're
not
claiming
that
there's
a
defect
in
the
information
or
indictment.
we
are
claiming
that
the
materials
upon
which
the
information
or
indictment
are
bottomed
where
themselves
obtained
by
illegal
search
and
seizure
and
under
new
york
procedure,
even
after
a
guilty
plea,
you
are
permitted
to
seek
appellate
review.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
the
two
--
two
of
the
hundreds
of
items
in
count
ii
had
been
acquired
by
a
purchase
of
the
police
officers
and
had
been
viewed
in
advance
by
the
magistrate
prior
to
the
seizure
involved
here,
yes.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
right.
and
in
fact
everything
that
was
on
the
premises
by
way
of
the
duplicate
of
those
two
films
were
seize
in
the
course
of
debate.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
the
films
were
appeared
in
count
ii
and
the
books
appeared
in
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
cannot.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
cannot
tell
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
then
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
none
at
all.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
don't
know
that.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
only
by
going
over
the
inventory
but
it
is
true,
your
honor
that
in
so
far
as
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
you
can't
tell
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
because
of
the
ambiguity
there
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
your
honor.
but
if
he
did
possess
them,
he
possessed
other
copies
of
the
same
films
which
were
seized
during
the
course
of
the
raid
of
which
we
complained.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
don't
think
that
is
clear
because
what
happen
is
a
result
of
this
was
that
the
entire
inventory
of
the
store
was
ransacked
on
the
basis
of
what
we
can't
contend
to
have
been
an
excuse
employed
in
order
to
make
it
appear
as
though
there
was
a
search
under
a
warrant.
once
you
have
two
films,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
necessity
of
acquiring
two
more
from
a
law
enforcement
standpoint
is
nil.
the
only
reason
for
acquiring
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
abundant
opportunities
to
charge
a
storeowner
under
these
circumstances
with
either
these
films
of
others
on
the
basis
of
the
conditioning
of
the
store
and
its
inventory.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
that's
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
only
three
counts
were
and
there
would
be
no
limitation
upon
the
law
enforcement
power
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
terms
of
what
it
was
that
was
doing
under
these
circumstances
in
controlling
the
distribution
of
what
it
claimed
to
be
obscenity.
now,
we
urge
further
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
petitioner
against
the
general
search
and
mass
seizure
which
took
place
here.
that
just
because
the
petitioner
opened
its
store
to
invite
customers
into
his
premises
to
buy
merchandise
does
not
mean
as
the
state
of
new
york
now
contends
that
it's
entire
expectation
of
privacy
is
forfeited
to
the
occupation
of
its
premises
by
the
police
force.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
it
seems
to
me
that
depends
upon
what
it
did.
if
he
came
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
it
would
seem
to
me
then
that
it
would
still
not
be
sufficient,
your
honor
for
the
reason
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
no,
i
think
that
the
massive
number
only
has
to
do
with
the
--
with
part
of
the
facts
involving
the
pervasive
seizure
and
control
and
domination
of
the
entire
enterprise.
the
fact
is
that
these
police
officers
did
not
limit
themselves
to
the
position
of
a
customer
and
the
premises.
indeed,
if
a
customer
on
the
premises
had
come
in
and
ransacked
the
material
and
taken
the
books
off
the
display
shelf
and
put
them
on
the
floor
and
torn
out
the
cellophane
covers,
and
stood
in
front
and
stopped
customers
from
coming
in
and
taking
their
names
and
addresses
and
rummaged
through
business
records
and
had
done
all
the
things
that
these
police
officers
did,
these
store
proprietor
in
my
judgment
would
have
had
the
right
to
call
these
very
policemen
and
eject
them
and
to
bring
actions
against
them
for
trespass.
and
so
consequently,
they
do
not
stand
in
the
shoes
of
a
normal
customer
and
for
that
reason,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
store
proprietor
does
not
move
his
expectation
of
privacy
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
there
will
not
be
a
police
force
which
will
do
the
things
which
have
been
done
here.
now,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor
that
we
must
first
take
a
look
at
the
warrant.
the
warrant
itself
demonstrates
nothing
by
way
of
probable
cause
with
respect
to
any
other
item
than
the
two
films
themselves
which
were
purchased
and
reviewed
by
both
the
judge
and
the
police
officer.
there
is
a
list
of
things
to
come,
predictions
of
things
to
come
in
section
3
of
the
warrant
which
says
that
there
are
bunch
of
other
items
that
are
to
be
seized
as
well
but
they
were
absolutely
blank
at
the
time
of
the
search
and
seizure.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
so
long
as
he
does
not
use
his
judicial
authority
to
effectuate
the
search
during
the
time
that
he's
examining
the
material.
if
he
acts
in
a
way
that
the
judge
in
heller
versus
new
york
did,
then
we
would
have
no
objection
to
that.
what
--
what
occurred
here
however
is
that
they
took
possession
of
the
store
and
seized
its
entire
contents
before
any
of
that
judicial
review
occurred,
and
there's
another
problem
too.
and
that
is
that
when
a
magistrate
issues
a
warrant
after
himself
have
participated
in
the
search
and
seizure.
he
becomes
a
part
of
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
and
he
has
not
use
the
force
of
judicial
office
and
he
has
not
effectuated
the
search.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
what
the
record
does
reflect
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
on
the
other
hand,
however,
at
the
time
that
the
police
officers
arrived
in
force,
they
came
and
announce
that
this
individual
was
under
arrest.
they
read
him
his
miranda
rights.
they
also
announced
that
they
were
going
to
search
the
premises
they
produced
what
purported
to
be
a
warrant
and
under
those
circumstances
it
seems
to
me
that
he
was
acquiescing
to
authority
and
not
consenting
to
anything
that
would
have
any
constitutional
import.
he
was
not
a
free
agent
under
any
circumstances
during
the
six-hour
period
when
he
was
on
the
premises
the
officer
quite
candidly
admitted
that
he
was
not
free
to
leave,
he
was
under
arrest
and
he
was
in
a
situation
where
a
number
of
officers
were
all
over
the
store
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
interests
of
safety
and
concern
might
have
cause
him
to
make
such
a
comment
without
in
any
way
having
him
to
be
voluntary
consent.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
there
was
never
any
purported
consent
of
any
kind
to
that,
they
just
came
in
and
took
the
merchandise
off
the
shelves,
piled
it
on
the
floor,
tore
of
the
coverage
because
there
was
a
cellophane
seal
on
them
which
prevents
anyone
from
opening
the
package
and
looking
inside.
and
consequently,
there
was
no
suggestion
that
anyone
offered
an
invitation
to
the
officers
to
open
those
seals
or
to
look
at
business
records
or
to
do
the
myriad
other
things
that
occurred
during
the
course
of
this
record.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
it's
fundamentally
different
because
of
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
and
also,
it
is
unclear
when
a
criminal
prosecution
occurs
as
to
whether
or
not
the
cans
of
spinach
are
even
involved.
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
a
substantial
difference.
i
think
that
if
there's
probable
cause
to
seize
the
spinach
in
a
numbers
that
you
suggest,
that
in
itself
suggest
no
fourth
amendment
problems
and
so
long
as
the
materials
are
particularly
described,
i
don't
see
that
that
raises
any
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
except
for
the
considerations
are
probable
cause
in
particularity,
your
honor,
which
are
requirements
with
respect
to
all
fourth
amendment
seizures.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
have
special
prior
restraint
problems
when
you
have
first
amendment
material
which
doesn't
apply
to
spinach.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
so
long
as
the
particularity
and
specificity
and
probable
cause
requirements
have
been
met,
it
would
seem
to
me.
and
then
of
course,
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
a
warrant
were
required
and
all
of
those
considerations,
i
think
that
would
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
subject
but
i
would
suppose
that
that
might
be
affected.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
that
either
he
has
to
acquire
in
some
lawful
way
or
it
may
well
be
that
a
customer
or
somebody
else
has
acquired
certain
material.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
it
seems
to
me
that
he's
limited
to
performing
in
the
way
that
a
customer
will
be
permitted
to
conform
if
he
exceeds
that
then
he's
acting
as
a
policeman
and
not
as
a
customer
and
exceeds
any
such
responsibility,
and
i
think
that
becomes
a
seizure.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
i
think
that
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
terry
and
recently
in
delaware
against
prouse,
very
little
is
required
in
order
to
effectuate
a
seizure
either
of
a
person
or
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
a
can
of
spinach
could
be,
your
honor
or
opening
the
trunk
of
mr.
chadwick
in
the
chadwick
case.
you
know,
any
of
those
items
seems
to
me
effectuates
a
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
apparently
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
it
acquires
in
a
lawful
manner
and
that
of
course
is
attached
to
him
which
i
think
is
constitutional
implication.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
except
for
the
two
books
that
they
originally
purchased.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that's
right,
they
didn't
know
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
think
that
the
difference
is
because
of
legal
acquisition
and
acquisition
by
something
other
than
the
authority
of
the
state
which
makes
the
constitutional
difference.
the
attempt
by
the
state
to
deal
with
the
warrant
by
after
the
fact
adding
14
pages
to
a
two-page
warrant
demonstrates
the
importance
of
their
concern
at
the
warrant
be
the
basis
upon
which
state
attempted
to
search.
