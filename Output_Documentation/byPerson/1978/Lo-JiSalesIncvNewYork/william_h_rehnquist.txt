justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
say
that
the
presence
of
the
magistrate
on
the
premises
didn't
even
nil,
it
didn't
cure
the
problems
to
which
you've
alluded
but
actually
intensified
them.
how
--
how
would
the
state
go
about
handling
the
service
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
it
i
said
in
the
constitutional
means?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'd
understood
that
the
magistrate's
premise
--
that
the
magistrate's
presence
here
was
in
order
to
assure
that
before
seizure
some
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
would
have
examined
the
material.
you
--
you
said
that's
simply
exacerbates
the
situation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
the
magistrate's
presence
was
neither
improves
nor
detracts
from
your
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,doesn't
the
guilty
plea
waive
any
defect
in
the
information
or
indictment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can
see
that
two
items
were
not,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
your
honor.
with
the
understanding
and
it
was
done
after
the
motion
to
suppress
had
been
denied
and
under
the
provisions
of
section
710.70
subsection
(2)
of
the
new
york
criminal
procedure
code.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
client
told
he
didn't
have
to
put
a
quarter
in
the
movie
reels,
didn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
of
the
reasons
--
isn't
the
principle
is
that
they
have
cellophane
wrappers
or
the
books
to
prevent
freeloaders
from
reading
them
and
without
buying
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
then
that
a
police
officer
has
to
buy
the
book
before
he
can
inspect
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
a
police
officer
can
inspect
the
book
--
cannot
inspect
the
book
on
the
premises
by
tearing
the
cellophane
coverall.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
parker,
you
--
when
you're
making
a
search
incident
to
arrest
and
you
find
a
gun
on
a
man,
you
don't
have
to
pay
the
man
the
price
of
the
gun,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
many
counts
were
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
ran
the
risk
of
those
particular
10
would
be
found
to
be
not
obscene
i
suppose.
