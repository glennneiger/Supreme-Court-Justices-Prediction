400.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
count
you're
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
it
3
(a)?
well,
how
do
you
know
that
the
two
that
receives
were
included
in
count
ii?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
--
where
do
you
find
that
the
two
copies
that
were
purchased
are
included
in
count
ii?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
tell
me
how
do
you
know
that
among
the
474
movie
reels
mentioned
in
count
ii,
how
do
you
know
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
two
that
were
bought
were
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
they
weren't?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
have
no
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know
they
are
even
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
would
you
know
which
is
which?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
officer
bought
them
and
they
were
his.
it's
--
it's
a
strange
way
then
to
say
that
to
charge
then
somebody
with
possessing.
he
--
maybe
he
did
possess
them
at
one
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
him,
nothing
wrong
with
him
going
back
and
buying
either
10
more
books
and
i
suppose
that
if
the
search
warrant
procedures
were
valid
there'll
be
nothing
wrong
will
properly
carried
out,
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
seizing
him
under
a
search
warrant
if
the
post
procedures
were
proper.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
that
if
a
magistrate
accompanies
an
investigator
to
a
store
and
he
examines
books
on
the
shelves
and
looks
at
them
as
much
as
he
wants
and
then
goes
back
to
the
office
and
issues
of
search
warrant
to
seize
one
copy
of
each
of
the
following
titles
as
evidence
and
he
says
i
have
searchingly
focused
on
the
issue
of
obscenity
and
think
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
they're
obscene.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
he
comes
to
the
store
and
if
he
does
nothing
in
the
store
that
any
other
member
of
the
public
could
not
do.
if
he
does
nothing
but
what
member
of
the
public
could
do
if
that's
all
he
did,
you
would
have
--
that
would
be
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
wouldn't
be
--
that
wouldn't
reach
taking
the
cellophane
or
the
plastic
wrappers
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
aren't
included
in
these
400
and
some
films?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
they
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
certainly
wouldn't
list
these
two
items
that
have
been
bought
on
the
search
warrant
or
an
inventory
of
things
that
have
been
seized
in
the
search
warrant
cause
they
weren't
seize
in
the
search
warrants
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
i'm
talking
about
these
two
copies.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
so
--
so
that
those
are
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
i
wanted
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
only
ones
--
so
the
only
ones
on
which
this
conviction
rest
are
the
ones
that
receives
in
the
search
and
seizure
under
the
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
say,
let's
assume
that
when
these
two
films
were
bought
and
they
were
brought
back
to
the
judge,
suppose
the
judge
had
look
at
and
them
and
said
i
have
now
focused
on
the
nature
of
these
articles.
i've
read
them
from
cover
to
cover.
there's
probable
cause
to
think
that
they
are
obscene.
i
hereby
authorize
you
to
go
back
to
the
store
and
seize
all
other
copies
of
these
two
books.
do
you
--
tell
me
what
case
in
this
court
would
warrant
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
client
--
the
cases
that
would
say
that
would
be
forbidden?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
before
the
hearing
--
whenever
the
hearing
was
either
that
it
was
tomorrow
or
this
afternoon,
you
took
all
copies
out
of
circulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
tell
me
some
case
that
warrants
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
there
had
to
be
an
adversary
hearing
before
you
completely
remove
from
circulation
all
copies
of
materials
like
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
kingsley
books
was
interim
in
injunction,
it
wasn't
seizure?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
what
we're
talking
about
is
marcus
and
quantity
of
books.
justice
byron
r.
white
different
from
what
my
brother
white
has
just
been
suggesting?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
is
it
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
marcus
and
quantity
of
books
said
you
can't
seize
the
whole
group
without
having
the
adversary
proceeding
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
after
you
--
after
you
denied
this
motion
to
suppress
you
took
advantage
of
your
new
york
statute
which
spend
them
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
new
york
statute
permitted
them
to
do
just
exactly
what
he
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
about
looking
in
--
how
about
taking
the
cellophane
off
of
the
package?
isn't
that
a
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
a
way,
you
certainly
just
can't
pat
it
down
like
you
can
if
you
--
and
tell
if
it's
obscene.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know,
sometimes
you
can
pat
people
down
and
discover
and
see
if
the
--
but
you
can't
search
them.
here
they
took
cellophane
off
the
packages
and
actually
looks
the
books.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
an
understatement
seizing
more
than
one,
isn't
it?
you
seize
them
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
did
you
seize
all
the
copies
in
any
magazine?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
was
rather
an
understatement?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
seize
all
of
the
item?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
could
not
sell
those
particular
items?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
--
there
was
a
plea
of
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
there
never
was
a
sentence.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
each
separate
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
separate
count?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
he
rips
it
open?
justice
byron
r.
white
eleven
police
officers?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
needed
the
support
of
10
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
off
--
no,
i
get
a
new
member
of
the
public
would
have
the
privilege
of
going
in
and
looking
at
all
these
movies
and
these
machines.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
for
a
quarter?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
say
that
wasn't
the
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wasn't
the
search
because
any
member
of
the
public
could
have
done
it
with
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
there
is
on
--
there
is
in
the
cellophane
package
with
it
unless
the
public
buys
it
and
pays
the
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let
me
get
it
clear.
do
you
say
that
all
of
the
movies
--
movie
reels
in
count
ii
are
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyone
that
he
looked
at
that
he
thought
was
obscene
he
seized
all
copies
of
that
film?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
--
are
there
any
cases,
i
think
there
is
a
case
that
involves
projector
--
seizing
projectors
but
do
you
know
of
any
case
that
involves
seizure
of
all
projectors
so
that
the
person
in
the
business
of
showing
movies
has
to
order
a
new
projector
in
order
to
show
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
even
--
i
take
it
you
left
him
some
films
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
but
if
he
wanted
to
show
some
films
that
weren't
obscene,
he
wouldn't
still
wouldn't
have
any
projector,
would
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
point
down
the
moving
picture
part
of
the
store
for
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
you
have
after
you
seized
400
films
that
you
wouldn't
have
had
if
you'd
only
seize
10?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you'd
seize
10
and
one
projector
and
then
he
went
to
trial
on
that.
what
would
you
have
had
--
justice
byron
r.
white
on
this
thesis,
you
didn't
need
more
than
one
copy
of
each
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can
have
evidence
to
how
many
they
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
always
just
believe
witnesses
there
in
goshen,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you'd
seize
a
copy
of
a
book
of
which
there
were
100
copies
in
the
store
and
you
had
a
trial
two
days
later,
adversary
trial
that
was
determined
to
be
obscene.
you
could
go
back
and
get
all
the
rest
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
would
be
the
--
if
they
were
still
there.
