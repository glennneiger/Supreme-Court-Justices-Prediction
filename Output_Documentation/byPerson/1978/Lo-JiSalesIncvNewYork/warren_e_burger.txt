chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
78-511,
lo-ji
sales,
inc.
against
new
york.
counsel,
i
suggest
you
can
take
your
seat
until
the
crowd
clears.
mr.
berkman,
i
think
you
may
proceed
now
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
the
proper
procedure
was
for
the
officer,
for
an
officer
not
a
judge
but
an
officer
to
go
on
the
premises
of
the
store
and
buy
selective
pieces
of
material,
books
and
films
than
take
them
back,
show
them
to
the
magistrate
or
the
judge
as
the
basis
for
getting
a
warrant
at
a
later
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
that
is
if
you
concede
that's
an
appropriate
way
under
heller
and
other
cases.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
have
any
problem
whether
it
was
11
or
22
or
33
officers
entering
the
premises
buying
books,
films,
and
then
appear
all
together
or
one
by
one
leaving
the
premises
and
taking
them
to
a
magistrate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
--
what's
the
impact,
let's
assume
there's
that
a
proprietor
is
somewhat
intimidated,
what's
that
got
to
do
with
what
they
buy
and
take
to
the
magistrate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
it
is.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
he
pleaded
guilty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
how
did
the
conviction
come
about?
why
did
it
rest
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
then
going
back
to
the
suggestion
or
questions
of
several
other
of
my
colleagues,
suppose
we
agreed
with
you
as
to
count
i
and
iii
and
disagreed
with
you
as
to
count
ii
which,
if
i
had
the
numbers
correctly
as
the
one,
count
ii
rests
on
two
films
which
is
standing
alone,
you
don't
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
472.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wait
a
minute
now
if
we
--
if
they
tried
this
case,
there'd
be
more
of
a
problem
but
if
they're
going
to
a
jury
verdict
based
on
all
the
films,
the
two
plus
all
the
hundreds
of
others,
there's
a
guilty
plea
with
respect
to
the
two
plus
others
under
count
ii,
is
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
how
--
then
how
can
you,
how
do
you
justify
challenging
the
two
that
they
were
properly
in
the
possession
of
the
police?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
pleaded
guilty
with
respect
to
those
two
along
with
others?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
we've
said
before
that
that's
the
one
appropriate
way
to
go
about
it
to
seize
a
sample
of
the
particular
item.
one
sample
now
as
to
two
films
it's
clear
that
that
was
done,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
this
had
been
done
by
one
officer?
well,
without
the
10
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
one
officer
did
everything
that
the
11
officers
did?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
the
11
is
--
11
or
1
is
not
really
crucial
to
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
berkman,
for
the
constitutional
purposes
of
this
case
and
laying
aside
for
the
moment
this
special
consideration
given
to
books
as
we've
indicated
in
our
opinions,
is
this
case
any
different
from
what
it
would
be
if
a
warrant
had
been
issued
for
to
pick
up
two
sample
cans
of
spinach
on
the
ground
they
have
information
or
reason
to
believe
that
they
might
be
contaminated
and
the
two
cans
of
spinach
were
seized
and
then
all
the
things
that
happened
here
with
reference
to
the
other
merchandise
occurred.
all
of
the
canned
goods
in
the
grocery
store
and
all
the
red
and
everything
else
was
taken.
is
it
fundamentally
any
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
said
except
for
that,
they
never
signed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
food
and
drug
administration
does
make
seizures
at
times,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
take
it
from
your
point
of
view
they
can't
seize
all
the
spinach
in
the
store
until
they
determine
on
the
basis
of
sampling
that
some
of
it
is
contaminated.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
so
far
the
fourth
amendment
concerned,
there
is
no
difference,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
mere
tearing
of
the
wrapper
becomes
a
seizure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
fact,
it
could
be
like
breaking
the
can
of
spinach
open
with
a
can
opener
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
berkman.
mr.
parker.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock,
mr.
parker.
counsel,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
that
have
some
resemblance
to
prior
restraint?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
took
all
the
books
of
a
particular
category.
they
couldn't
sell
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i'm
talking
about
restraint
on
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
if
you
want
to
be
a
little
more
sure,
maybe
it
takes
six
plus,
one
plus
six?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
