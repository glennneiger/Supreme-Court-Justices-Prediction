mr.
richard
l.
parker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
richard
parker,
i'm
an
assistant
district
attorney
from
goshen,
new
york,
that's
a
small
upstate
county.
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
declared
an
uncertain
terms
how
a
public
policy
to
be
the
protection
of
moral
decency
and
in
furtherance
oft
this
public
policy
it
has
authorized
the
various
units
of
the
state
to
prosecute
criminal
possession
of
promoting
obscene
material.
in
order
to
effectuate
this
police
policy
against
the
commercial
establishment
which
has
a
large
number
of
obscene
items
and
obscene
material,
we
have
tried
after
studying
this
court's
decisions
to
come
up
with
the
procedure
which
on
one
hand
will
protect
first
amendment
rights
and
on
the
other
hand
gives
us
an
opportunity
to
effectuate
this
legislative
policy.
in
effect
we
try
to
do
is
following
a
fair
middle
ground.
what
we
did
in
this
case
was
have
a
police
officer
go
to
the
store
and
look
around
the
store.
he
then
bought
a
small
sample
of
two
items
and
to
clarify
for
the
record,
mr.
mandagas,
the
clerk
of
the
store
was
charged
for
possessing
with
intent
promoting
these
two
items
on
the
day
that
these
items
were
sold.
the
officer
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no,
that's
a
footnote
i
believe
in
my
brief.
mr.
mandagas
case
is
not
on
appeal.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
he
subsequently
pleaded
guilty
to
disorderly
conduct,
was
given
a
conditional
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
--
that
was
given
a
conditional
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
promoting
those
two
items
on
the
day
they
were
purchased.
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
they
are
--
the
same
films
are
included
but
those
two
items
are
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
from
the
inventory.
the
inventory
and
the
search
warrant
tells
you
at
the
inventory
least
all
472
items
which
the
reels
and
films
were
list
all
the
magazines
and
list
the
names
of
all
the
films
that
were
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no,
but
other
copies
of
the
--
that
were
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no,
right.
were
these
two
copies
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
i
want
to
clarify
that.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
and
if
you
look
at
the
criminal
charges,
the
basis
of
these
charges
are
promoting
the
items
on
june
20th
the
date
of
these
seizure.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
don't
believe
any
case
in
this
case
court
would
warrant
that
alone.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
but
i
think
there's
an
important
distinction
in
this
case
and
that
was
that
when
we
went
in
to
this
bookstore
and
before
there
was
any
seizure,
we
entered
the
store
was
open
to
the
public.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
when
we
went
in
there,
the
clerk
was
given
the
warrant
and
was
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
an
immediate
adversary
hearing
as
soon
as
he
would
be
ready
or
the
owner
of
those
materials
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
temporarily,
we
did,
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
believe
under
kingsley
books,
we
can
do
that.
the
kingsley
books,
there
was
a
case
where
more
than
one
copy
of
the
book
was
taken.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
i
don't
believe,
i
believe
kingsley
books
are
the
court
held
that
you
could
temporarily
take
those
items
and
then
hold
an
adversary
hearing
afterwards.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
believe
this
is
different
from
marcus
and
quantity
of
books.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
it's
different
because
the
items
were
taken
as
evidence,
a
judge
had
viewed
the
items
and
made
a
probable
course
determination
plus
it's
different
because
after
they
were
taken
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
i
believe
they
said
you
cannot
seize
them
for
destruction
purposes.
we
were
seizing
them
for
evidence
purposes
to
bring
a
criminal
prosecution
and
we
were
going
to
bring
that
as
soon
as
we
possibly
could
and
i
should
add
that
at
no
time
did
the
petitioner
in
this
case
ever
asked
for
any
hearing
as
to
the
obscenities.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
pleaded
guilty
as
to
the
obscenity
of
all
the
items.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
that's
right
but
under
our
new
york
statute,
he
could
have
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
obscenity
and
if
he
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
that's
right
but
it
certainly
did
in
anyway
inhibit
from
also
having
a
trial
as
if
he
thought
the
items
were
not
obscene.
he
could
have
had
that
trial
also.
the
reason
i
feel
that
this
procedure
is
fair
and
proper
is
because
we
have
the
safeguards
of
having
a
prior
judicial
officer
look
at
the
interior
before
it
seize
--
the
officer
had
an
--
the
judicial
officer
first
had
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
believe
he
was
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
oh,
i
believe
the
material
may
influence
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
think
that
material
may
influence
but
i
don't
think
it
changed
his
being
bias.
i
think
the
record
shows
that
all
times
he
did
what
he
thought
should
be
done.
he
was
leading
the
party.
in
other
words,
he
made
the
determinations
what
should
be
taken
and
what
should
not
be
taken.
he
made
the
determination
whether
or
not
an
item
should
be
taken.
even
towards
the
end,
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
record.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
there
would
have
--
well
at
the
hearing,
there
would
have
been
a
different
judicial
officer
presiding
this.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
after
--
well,
i
don't
believe
him.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no,
i
disagree
that
they
had
already
seized
anything.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
feel
if
the
judge
had
gone
through
this
entire
store
and
determine
that
everything
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
the
testimony
was
that
he
was
told
that
there
was
award
for
his
arrest.
he
was
free
to
move
freely
throughout
the
store.
he
was
brought
a
meal.
he
moved
freely
throughout
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
he
would
not
have
been
free
to
move
outside.
and
our
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
there
was
a
seizure
of
his
person
but
not
a
seizure
of
the
material.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
the
reason
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no,
i
think
the
reason
that
you
had
all
these
people
here
was
to
try
to
do
the
search.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
oh,
i
have
considered
policeman
a
person,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
they
do.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
think
the
reason
you
have
the
number
of
these
people
is
so
you
can
expedite
the
procedure
as
quickly
as
possible.
we
have
people
there.
you
have
one
person
who
was
there
who
was
recording
what
the
judge
was
doing.
there
were
other
people
there
who
were
gathering
the
items
that
the
judge
had
told
them
to
seize.
there
were
other
people
there
who
would
put
things
in
order
so
the
judge
can
review
as
quickly
as
possible.
there
were
other
people
who
were
at
the
front
of
the
store
to
find
out
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no,
they
weren't,
i
don't
believe.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
he
makes
--
well,
they
were
in
the
store,
they
were
left
in
the
store,
they
were
in
a
pile
and
they
would
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
suppose
he
could
of
if
he
wanted
to
but
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
what?
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
don't
think
they
would
afford
them.
there
was
no
--
no
indication
of
that.
but
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
it
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
the
state
of
new
york
has
upheld
this
which
is
in
effect
an
oral
warrant
and
they
have
upheld
under
this
circumstances
where
you're
dealing
with
books
and
films
and
magazines
where
you
have
to
have
a
judge
go
in
and
look
at
it
prior.
they
have
said
and
they
have
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
but
they
have
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no,
you
don't,
your
honor.
but
the
point
i'd
like
to
make
there
is
that
what
we've
--
the
function
of
a
warrant,
the
purpose
of
the
warrant
as
you've
stated
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
if
one
foot
have
prior
authorization
of
probable
cause
and
to
the
limit
the
police
discretion
by
particularly
describing
what
they
should
take.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
this
judge,
looked
at
the
material
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
i
submit
it
wasn't
after
it
had
been
seized.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
because
i
see
--
in
other
words,
i
submit
that
there
was
no
seizure
of
material
that
was
left
in
the
store.
there
were
many
items
that
he
looked
at
determined
were
not
obscene
and
he
left
them
in
the
store.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
in
a
way
it's
a
search
but
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
that's
--
well,
but
you
see
these
magazines
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
but
they
were
taking
a
cellophane
off
the
books
which
had
obscene
photographs
at
the
front
of
the
books
which
is
almost
identical
to
seeing
a
bold
outside
someone
in
patting
him
down
that.
i
believe
that
the
judge
given
the
nature
of
this
market
would
have
had
the
right
to
after
seeing
an
obscene
photograph
asked
the
police
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
seizure
of
more
than
one
copy
does
not
invalidate
the
entire
search.
it
must
be
remembered
that
under
new
york
law,
a
person
is
prosecuted
not
for
merely
possessing
the
item
but
for
promoting
the
item.
now,
obviously
this
is
a
commercial.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no,
we
did
not
seize
everything.
we
left
many
magazines
but
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
any
--
yes,
anytime
that
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
anytime
the
judge
after
viewing
the
item
felt
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
he
seize
every
copy
in
that
store
but
there
was
never
any
claim
made
that
this
person
did
not
have
access
to
other
items
or
could
not
bring
him
in
the
next
day.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
he
could
not
sell
those
items.
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
oh,
obviously
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
he
could
not
sell
them.
that
doesn't
mean
they
were
not
available
to
the
public
in
the
area.
there
were
other
stores
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
is
it
--
yes,
there
was
but
that
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
--
res
--
right,
but
that
restraint
i
submit
was
a
temporary
restraint
because
he
had
the
right
to
a
full
hearing
and
also
that
restraint
was
for
valid
evidentiary
purpose
to
show
that
he
was
promoting
the
item.
under
our
law,
there
is
a
presumption
that
if
you
possess
six
or
more
of
the
same
items
and
it's
presumptive
evidence
that
you
posses
with
intent
to
promote
and
what
we
had
to
show
aside
from
that
fact
that
the
items
were
themselves
obscene
that
this
person
was
promoting
obscenity
on
the
day
in
question.
so
there
was
a
valid
evidentiary
reason
to
seize
them.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
obviously
there
could
be
testimony
but
the
best
evidence
would
be
shown
in
the
jury
the
fact
that
you
have
this
many
items.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
if
you,
as
you
can
see
for
more
brief,
very
few,
i
think
only
two
or
three
case
and
they
seized
more
than
six.
most
of
the
items
of
the
vast
majority
only
one
item
was
seized
and
then
there
are
small
time
you
took
two
of
the
items.
most
of
them
are
one
or
two
items
were
seized.
very
few
was
there
more
than
six
being
seized
of
more
than
five
being
seized.
now,
the
other
method,
another
point
should
be
made
is
that
you
have
three
separate
pleas
of
guilty
and
under
the
third
count
for
the
films
in
the
pictures.
there
were
no
duplicate
seizures
there.
that
count
was
entitled
to
separate
that
was
the
first
part
of
the
search
and
there
were
no
duplicates.
the
only
thing
that
was
seized
was
that
one
copy
of
the
film
that
was
being
displayed
to
the
public.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
what?
mr.
richard
l.
parker
there
weren't
duplicates.
there
was
one
copy
that
was
there
and
that
was
what
it
was
seized.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
probably.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
the
projectors
were
seized.
again,
to
show
promotion.
now,
the
other
method
that's
been
suggested
is
to
go
in
and
to
buy
the
item
but
unfortunately
in
a
small
upstate
county
like
we
have,
we
don't
have
the
funds
to
go
and
then
buy
all
the
obscene
items
that
are
being
displayed
and
exploited
to
the
public
because
the
affidavit
of
petitioner
in
support
of
his
allegations
for
a
search
warrant.
he
--
he
said
that
we
took
$15,000.00
worth
of
material,
that's
what
he
says
his
quest
was.
i've
never
told
that
it
up.
but
assuming
his
figure
is
correct
our
entire
investigatory
budget
for
the
whole
county
to
fight
all
crime
in
our
county
is
only
$20,000.00.
we
wouldn't
have
enough
funds,
public
funds
to
go
and
expend
to
buy
all
the
obscene
material
that's
being
promoted.
so
the
only
--
i
mean
we
cannot
go
in
there
and
buy
one
or
two
copies
or
buy
one
copy
of
each
item
that
is
just
not
enough
money
in
our
budget
to
do
it.
this
is
really
the
only
effect
of
way
we
have
to
enforce
our
legislative
policy.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
the
sentence
was
a
fine
of
$1,000.00
on
each
count.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
each
separate
count
had
a
fine
of
$1,000.00
and
that
fine
has
been
paid.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
three.
three
separate
counts.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
what?
no,
we
don't
get
that
fine
money.
that
goes
to
the
state.
i
submit
that
the
procedure
we
employed
here
is
a
limited
procedure
which
protects
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes.
and
first
of
all,
the
entry
into
the
store
under
this
procedure
is
limited
to
stores
when
they're
open
to
the
public.
it's
the
items
that
are
being
viewed
are
limited
to
the
judge
viewing
items
that
are
being
openly
displayed
to
the
public.
you
have
a
judge
or
a
judicial
officer
who
was
viewing
the
item
before
anything
has
taken
from
the
store
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
after
--
yes,
after
it's
been
ripped
open.
but
you
have
a
cover
on
this
which
gives
him
i
submit
probable
cause
to
make
further
inquiry
to
see
if
the
item
is
obscene
especially
after
a
police
officer
has
gone
in
has
found
out
that
this
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no,
initially
one
police
officer
goes
in,
he
brought
a
small
sample
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
to
make
the
search.
he
needed
that
support
in
order
to
make
it
as
quick
as
possible
so
that
it
would
be
the
least
amount
of
restraint
as
possible.
well,
restraint
in
the
sense
it
takes
time
if
you
have
one
judge.
if
the
judge
goes
in
by
himself,
it's
going
to
take
a
much
longer
to
go
everything
to
look
at
everything
and
to
gather
the
staff
and
take
it
out
of
the
store.
so
then
petitioner
would
claim
that
it
was
a
longer
restraint.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
it
did
take
him
six
hours
cause
he
had
a
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
believe
it
would
take
much
longer,
i
can't
tell
you
how
long
it
would
take.
but
i
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
certainly,
they
have
the
privilege
of
going
and
looking
at
the
movies
and
the
machine.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes.
and
the
judge
in
this
case
and
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
the
judge
offered
to
put
a
quarter
in
every
machine
and
the
clerk
of
the
store
said
it
won't
be
necessary.
i
can
turn
them
all
on
so
it
will
be
quicker.
and
he
voluntarily
turned
them
on.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i'm
saying
that
the
viewing
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
viewing
of
the
material
which
is
openly
displayed
to
the
public,
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
this
petitioner
that
the
public
will
not
see
this
material.
i'm
saying
that
that
viewing
is
not
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes.
but
in
other
words,
the
items
are
not
being
hidden
from
the
public,
it's
not
--
when
you
think
of
the
word
search,
you
think
of
looking
for
substance
being
hidden,
this
is
not
material
that's
being
hidden.
this
is
material
that's
being
displayed
openly
to
the
public
in
areas
of
the
store
open
to
the
public.
at
no
time
that
any
member
of
law
enforcement
where
this
judge
ever
go
into
a
storeroom
or
to
see
what
was
not
being
displayed
to
the
public,
it
was
limited
to
the
public
areas
that
items
that
were
openly
displayed
to
the
public.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
the
business
records
were
seized
to
show
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
--
to
promotion
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
they
were
behind
the
front
desk,
i
believe.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
everything
that
he
was
charged
with
possessing
under
this
statute
under
this
information
was
limited
to
public
areas.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
they
went
behind
the
counter,
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
cause
that's
where
the
clerk
of
the
store
had
stationed
himself.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
the
clerk
was
there
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
the
clerk
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
they
went
behind
to
arrest
the
clerk.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no,
i
don't
believe
the
public
would
go
behind
it.
but
they
did
go
behind
it
to
arrest
him,
the
clerk.
now,
i
would
say
that
at
the
time
of
entry
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
officer
had
learned
from
the
clerk
that
the
store
was
selling
this
sex-type
material
on
june
20th
when
he
bought
two
items
and
the
judge
had
in
fact
reviewed
two
of
those
items
in
their
entirety
that
the
judge
certainly
had
probable
cause
to
believe
they're
going
to
be
other
items
in
the
store
of
a
commercial
being
exploit
on
a
commercial
nature
which
was
sexually
obscene
material.
and
i
think
this
may
give
him
on
other
basis.
on
that
claim,
that
was
the
basis
he
used
but
i
am
claiming
that
he
certainly
have
reason
to
look
at
other
items
in
the
store.
had
a
reason
to
believe
that
in
this
type
of
market
which
is
exclusively
selling
sexually
explicit
material
that
the
he
certainly
had
a
right
to
look
at
whatever
was
being
displayed
to
the
public
to
make
an
initial
screening
so
that
he
could
determine
for
himself
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
to
seize
it.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
not
all
are
different.
there
some
duplicates.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
he
did.
but
the
issue
of
the
way
he
focused
on
the
material
which
has
been
raised
by
counsel
has
to
be
under
--
it
must
be
emphasized
that
this
focusing
the
market
where
this
was
done
that
the
judge
had
first
seen
two
short
films
in
their
entirety
and
then
gone
into
the
booths
and
seen
parts.
and
i
say
its
substantial
part
of
many
of
each
of
these
films
and
continuously
would
see
films
which
were
just
depicting
one
sex
act
after
another.
i
submit
that
in
this
type
of
market,
a
judge
could
do
enough
of
initial
search
without
having
to
see
the
entire
item
to
know
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
it's
obscene
and
to
bring
it
into
court
so
there
can
be
a
criminal
prosecution
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
aware
of
anything.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
don't
believe
he
was
left
any
films.
i
believe
all
the
films
were
taken
out
of
the
store.
they
were
books
and
magazines
were
left
in
the
store.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
he
would
not
have,
no.
but
i
think
that
throughout
the
procedure
that
we
were
not
trying
to
suppress
the
material
or
try
to
close
the
store,
what
we
try
to
do
from
the
beginning
was
find
a
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
we
did
do
it
temporarily
but
what
--
the
point
was
from
the
beginning,
we
try
to
do
this
in
such
a
way
that
we
could
effectively
carry
out
the
legislative
mandate
to
protect
more
of
decency
but
we
did
it
in
such
a
way
that
this
individual
was
first
of
all
he
was
given
written
notification
of
his
right
to
an
immediate
hearing
before
any
seizure
at
all.
that
was
in
the
warrant.
he
was
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
what
you
would
it
--
the
diff
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
you
would
not
have
a
judicial
ruling
on
whether
or
not
the
other
390
or
whether
it
is
the
other
208
different
films
whether
or
not
those
were
obscene.
each
film
is
a
different
film.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
if
they're
found
not
obscene
then
we
leave
him
and
he
can
display
them
openly
and
promote
them
to
the
public
if
there's
a
ruling
that
they're
not
obscene.
we
have
no
--
we
don't
mind
that
but
we're
trying
to
do
in
effect
is
find
an
effective
way
to
protect
more
of
decency
given
the
fact
they
have
a
large
commercial
store
which
is
selling
a
vast
number
of
obscene
items.
we
want
to
bring
all
these
items
into
court
as
quickly
as
we
can,
as
efficiently
as
we
can
so
we
can
get
a
full
prompt
judicial
review
as
to
each
of
these
items
to
determine
that
they
are
in
fact
obscene.
and
before
we
do
that,
we
ask
the
judge
to
give
as
initial
determination
that
they
were
in
fact
obscene.
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
they
were
obscene
and
then
we
gave
them
the
right
to
litigate
it.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
not,
but
you
did
need
it
because
they
are
brought
in
for
criminal
purposes
and
the
criminal
law
is
not
mere
possession.
it's
promoting
and
we
have
to
also
show
promoting.
unless,
there's
going
to
be
stipulation
to
promote
it.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
that's
true.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
no,
they
don't
but
the
best
evidence
is
always
having
the
actual
material
there.
and
i
would
submit
that
since
they
had
the
right
to
have
it,
to
get
the
hearing
immediately
as
soon
as
they
were
ready
that
a
temporary
restraint
of
this
sort
would
not
invalidate
the
entire
search.
perhaps
the
court
would
order
that
the
other
materials
should
have
been
returned
but
if
the
violation
of
the
law
in
this
case
is
that
they
took
too
many
copies
under
the
first
amendment
then
i
think
the
appropriate
remedy
would
not
be
exclusion
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
entire
search.
but
would
be
to
order
the
court,
order
the
police
to
return
the
extra
copies
and
then
let
the
conviction
stand.
now,
i
think
that
if
you
look
--
that
looking
at
the
entire
procedure
that
we
follow
in
order
to
try
to
find
a
fair,
middle
ground
to
bring
all
these
items
into
court
that
this
is
the
only
procedure,
fair
procedure
that
you
can
use.
there's
no
other
procedure
that
would
effectively
work
to
bring
this
vast
number
of
items
into
court.
you
can't
subpoena
the
items
because
if
you
try
to
subpoena,
you
should
come
to
the
exact
same
situation
that
if
you
wait
for
the
issue
to
be
joined,
you
ran
the
risk
that
the
items
are
going
to
disappear,
either
claim
that
they
been
sold
in
due
course
or
in
this
case,
we
deal
with
a
corporation
that's
an
out-of-state
corporation
that
runs
a
store
if
we
subpoena.
make
the
subpoena
just
take
against
that
corporation
as
in
fact
as
happens
in
this
case,
he
changes
corporate
identity
and
there's
further
delay
so
we
lose
the
items.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
that's
correct,
if
they're
still
there.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
that
is
the
problem,
if
they
are
still
there.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
the
harm
if
they're
not
still
there
is
that
we've
gone
as
we
allowed
the
person
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
okay.
okay,
you
allow
him
in
the
interim
to
continue
to
sell
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
what?
no,
they
haven't
gone
that.
they
don't
go
--
they
don't
have
to
go
out
of
state.
the
corporation
only
have
to
do
is
change
the
corporate
name.
they
went
to
build
it.
an
out-of-state
corporation
comes
in
and
says,
we're
running
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
now
you
have
a
new
corporation
that
you
have
to
go
after.
you
have
to
start
all
over
again
which
means
that
is
going
to
be
judicial
to
language
which
means
that
material
can
be
sold
in
the
interim.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
think
that
–
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
it
would
be
much
difficult
certainly.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
there's
certainly
be
difficulties
involved
in
that
--
but
i
think
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
the
getting
an
injunction
would
have
been
--
is
completely
analogous
in
order
to
insure
that
the
evidence
was
there,
you
have
to
get
a
temporary
restraining
order
to
get
the
restraining
order
or
to
keep
them
there
you
would
have
to,
i
would
submit
bring
the
judge
to
the
store
to
at
least
make
an
initial
determination
that
there's
reason
to
get
the
restraintor
recieve
a
restraint
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
because
if
you
subpoena
the
material
–
well,
if
you
subpoena
the
material,
you
have
judicial
delay,
you
have
the
problem
that
if
you
subpoena
it,
you
have
to
have
a
reason
to
subpoena
it
so
you
have
to
have
initial
determination
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
but
then
you
are
going
to
have
to
subpoena
the
other
copies
which
are
in
the
store
and
you
haven't
review
them
initially
yet
unless
you
get
a
judge
to
go
in
and
initially
review
them
so
you
have
probable
cause
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
not,
no,
we
could
not.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
we
couldn't
discover
it
like
that.
we
would
have
to
have
a
judge
initially
view
it,
get
a
temporary
restraining
order
to
maintain
the
status
quo
and
enjoin
issue
and
that's
really
what
we
did
here.
we
took
it
we
temporarily
have
it
in
our
possession
until
the
issue
was
joined.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
don't
follow
when
you
say
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
believe
he
have
a
booking
shop
the
magistrate
will
not
have
to
because
the
police
officer
could
do
that.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
bucket?
mr.
richard
l.
parker
okay.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
would
think
the
judge
would
have
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
there's
noting
written
by
statute
but
i
think
the
judge
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
it's
not
written
in
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
to
go
in
there?
mr.
richard
l.
parker
if
that
--
if
what
i'm
doing
if
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
or
if
there
was
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
well,
let's
assume
that
the
racetrack
was
illegally
gambling,
taking
that's
illegally
--
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
cannot
name
you
another
instance,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
cannot
name
you
another
state
that
i'm
personally
aware
of.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
i
cannot
name
you
an
instance
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
parker
thank
you,
your
honor.
