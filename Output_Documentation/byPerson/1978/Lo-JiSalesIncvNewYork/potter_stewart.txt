justice
potter
stewart
but
under
my
brother
marshall's
question,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
had
there
just
been
a
purchase
of
two
items,
it
wouldn't
have
needed
to
be
a
magistrate
at
all.
there
could
have
just
been
a
prosecution
based
upon
those
two
items
and
that
would
have
been
up
to
the
jury
and
the
instructions
of
the
judge
and
it
would
have
been
all.
there
would
not
have
been
a
search
or
seizure.
there
has
been
purchase
of
two
items,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
don't
really
--
what
was
the
purpose
do
you
suppose
of
this
warrant
which
was
signed
on
the
morning
of
june
25,
1976
even
providing
for
the
seizure
of
items
1
and
2
since
those
two
items
are
already
been
purchased
and
we're
in
the
possession
of
prosecuting
authorities?
justice
potter
stewart
which
were
already
in
their
possession,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
already
in
the
possession
of
the
prosecuting
authority.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
doesn't
----
justice
potter
stewart
2
(a)
and
3
(a).
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
addition
to
the
two
individual
items
that
have
been
purchased,
i
suppose
under
the
purported
authority
of
the
search
warrant,
several
duplicate
copies
were
seized
under
paragraph
1,
2
of
the
search
warrant,
with
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
the
same
items?
justice
potter
stewart
the
search
warrant
does
by
using
the
plural
reels
in
both
cases
authorize
the
seizure
of
duplicate
copies.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
could
do
that
by
process
of
going
over
the
inventory?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
unless
you
want
to
charge
him
of
the
crime
of
possession
because
if
you
have
him,
he
no
longer
possesses
them.
justice
potter
stewart
where
do
you
see
that?
justice
potter
stewart
where
do
you
see
that
charge
in
the
appendix?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
for
possessing
those
two
items
on
the
day
they
were
purchased?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
he
authorized
it
after
the
fact,
that's
the
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
they
would
break
the
cellophane
and
bring
the
book
to
him
and
he'd
say
okay,
i
had
that
today,
yes,
that's
okay.
seize
that.
but
they'd
already
seized
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
my
problem
is
that
a
warrant
by
definition
is
a
prior
authorization.
it's
a
prior
authorization
issued
upon
probable
cause.
particularly,
describing
the
place
to
be
search
and
the
thing,
there
are
things
to
be
seized
and
there
was
not
a
prior
authorization
here.
here
he
says
the
judge
in
the
store
there
first
ordered
the
police
to
rip
off
the
sealed
plastic
which
completely
enclosed
each
of
the
magazines
and
many
of
the
books
in
the
store.
then
he
looks
through
him.
but
that's
not
a
prior
authorization.
there
was
a
seizure
before
the
authority
to
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
problem
because
a
warrant
by
definition
is
a
prior
authorization.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
reason
this
case
is
here
because
the
new
york
courts
upheld
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
prior
authorization.
justice
potter
stewart
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
after
it
had
been
seized?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
didn't
have
to
seize
them
all
to
show
that,
they're
actually
been
testimony.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
projectors
were
seized?
