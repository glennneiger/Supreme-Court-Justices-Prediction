mr.
david
rubin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case
mrs.
bessie
givhan.
question
presented
here
is
whether
a
teacher
was
unprotected
by
the
first
amendment
against
termination
of
her
employment
for
the
particular
view
she
expressed,
nearly
because
those
views
were
communicated
privately
to
her
principle
rather
than
in
a
public
forum.
the
case
arose
in
1971
in
mississippi
during
the
throes
of
court
ordered
school
desegregation.
mr.
david
rubin
no
your
honor,
the
district
court
in
this
case
found
that
the
primer
indeed
almost
the
entire
reason
for
the
termination
of
the
petitioner's
employment
was
because
of
her
criticism
of
certain
policies
and
practices
of
her
school
district
and
her
school
criticism
which
was
expressed
to
her
principle,
criticism
that
the
policies
and
practices
were
racially
discriminatory.
the
court
of
appeals
while
they
accepted
the
factual
findings
of
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
communications
for
which
he
was
penalized
were
unprotected
by
the
first
amendment
because
they
were
expressed
privately
to
her
principal
rather
than
in
a
public
forum.
this
is
a
ruling
that
the
respondents
have
conceded
was
erroneous
and
rightly
so
because
if
the
first
amendment
means
anything,
it
means
that
an
individual
is
protected
against
punishment
by
the
government
for
expressing
a
particular
idea.
this
isn't
to
say
that
first
amendment
interests
are
absolute
and
that
the
interest
of
the
school
district
as
the
employer
can't
be
accommodated.
but
this
court
created
a
means
for
such
accommodation
in
its
pickering
decision
which
established
the
balancing
test
under
which
the
teacher's
free
speech
interest
is
to
be
balanced
against
the
interest
of
the
school
district
as
employer
implicated
by
the
teacher's
expressions.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
to
recognize
a
free
speech
interest
in
a
teacher
to
express
a
particular
idea
to
her
principal
would
necessarily
imply
a
right
to
an
audience
with
the
principal
as
the
court
of
appeals
put
it.
but
no
right
of
access
of
any
sort
need
be
implied
by
the
ruling
that
we
seek
from
this
court,
the
--
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
it
may
be
assumed
arguendo
that
the
school
authorities
could
absolutely
bar
by
rule
or
regulation
or
directive
access
that
might
present
a
constitutional
question
but
it
would
be
not
the
constitutional
question
presented
by
this
case.
mr.
david
rubin
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
may
be
limits
that
must
be
placed
upon
what
the
school
authorities
can
do
by
way
barring
access.
but
for
this
case,
it
is
unnecessary
to
reach
that
question
because
there
were
no
regulations
of
direct
--
mr.
david
rubin
i
don't
think
of
the
--
that
it
would
be
and
sort
of
for
purposes
to
this
case
the
court
need
not
addressed
that
--
mr.
david
rubin
well
it's
clear
from
the
findings
of
the
district
court
here
that
the
petitioner
did
not
harass
the
principal.
that
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
there
were
only
two
occasions
on
which
she
communicated
these
criticisms
to
him.
mr.
david
rubin
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
that
the
petitioner
harassed
the
principal.
mr.
david
rubin
no
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
held
not
clearly
erroneous
the
district
court's
finding
that
the
primary
reason
for
the
termination
was
the
communications
that
were
made
by
the
petitioner
and
the
criticism
of
the
policies
and
practices
of
the
school
district
is
racially
discriminatory.
it
did
not
disturb
the
district
court's
findings
which
indicated
that
there
has
been
no
harassment.
mr.
david
rubin
well,
i
don't
want
to
exclude
the
possibility
that
the
school
district
might
show
some
other
legitimate
interest
in
the
--
in
not
hearing
or
not
or
in
precluding
the
expressions
but
i
don't
think
i
can
catalog
what
those
interests
might
be.
harassment
certainly
i
think
would
be
one
of
them.
since
the
respondents
have
rightly
conceded
that
the
court
of
appeals
holding
in
this
case
was
an
error.
this
presents
the
court
with
the
question
of
how
to
dispose
of
the
certiorari
issue
which
is
in
an
unusual
posture
admittedly
because
both
sides
have
agreed
that
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
was
wrong.
mr.
david
rubin
they
do
not
agree
that
the
judgment
was
wrong
and
--
mr.
david
rubin
well,
i
thought
i
ought
to
address
myself
to
the
posture
since
there
hasn't
been
any
debate
in
this
court
on
the
merits
of
the
certiorari
issue.
nevertheless
because
we
both
--
we
submit
the
issue
is
a
clear
one.
mr.
david
rubin
yes
there
is,
and
i
intend
in
one
moment
to
reach
that
question.
but
i
wanted
to
say
that
we
submit
the
court
should
resolve
the
certiorari
issue
on
the
merits
because
that
is
the
only
disposition
it
seems
to
us
that
will
assure
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
adhere
to
its
decision
in
this
case
with
mischievous
consequences
and
--
mr.
david
rubin
to
vacate
and
to
remand
in
light
of
the
respondent's
concession?
mr.
david
rubin
well,
the
reason
is
that
we
believe
that
this
court
should
wrap
up
this
case
now
because
--
and
decide
the
pickering
question,
the
respondents
have
asked
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed
on
the
ground
that
when
the
pickering
test
is
applied
the
respondents,
the
petitioners
rather
expressions
should
be
held
unprotected
and
we've
joined
with
the
respondents
in
asking
this
court
to
decide
the
issue
or
to
decide
it
in
the
petitioner's
favor.
a
remand
on
that
issue
with
mean
another
round
of
briefing
and
argument
in
a
case
that's
already
seven
and
a
half
years
old
and
we
submit
that
there
isn't
any
real
issue
to
be
decided
under
pickering
because
there
is
no
legitimate
interest
of
the
school
district
as
employer
that
is
implicated
or
was
implicated
by
the
petitioner's
expressions.
this
isn't
the
case
in
which
the
petitioner
was
making
some
personal
criticism
for
impugning
the
principal's
character.
she
spoke
on
--
in
connection
with
policies
and
practices
of
the
school
system.
they
were
matters
of
policy.
mr.
david
rubin
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rubin
that's
correct.
the
petitioner's
expressions
were
not
calculated
to
threaten
the
working
relationship
between
her
and
her
principal
because
they
held
no
potential
for
public
embarrassment.
they
were
given
the
private
context,
given
that
context,
the
only
purpose
the
petitioner
could
have
had
was
to
influence
the
principal
to
accept
her
ideas.
as
i've
indicated
there
was
no
harassment
because
under
the
district
court's
findings,
there
were
only
two
occasions
on
which
these
expressions
were
communicated
to
the
principal.
and
so,
since
there
were
no
legitimate
interests
of
the
school
district
as
the
employer
they
were
implicated
about
the
petitioner's
expressions.
there
was
nothing
to
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
scale
to
counterbalance
this
petitioner's
free
speech
interest.
mr.
david
rubin
your
honor,
i
think
there
might
be
a
constitutional
issue
that
could
be
raised
under
the
pickering
test.
in
other
words
there
may
be
--
mr.
david
rubin
well
its
--
it
is
conceivable
that
the
first
amendment
might
confirm
some
free
speech
right
to
criticize
at
least
school
policies
internally
rather
than
being
forced
to
go
into
a
public
forum
--
mr.
david
rubin
well,
at
least
a
possibly
a
duty
not
to
discipline
the
teacher
for
expressing
the
view
whether
he
had
to
listen
is
i
think
is
another
question.
but
none
of
these
questions
are
presented
by
the
issue
that
is
in
this
case
which
is
only
whether
a
teacher
can
be
disciplined
because
she
expressed
a
particular
idea
to
her
principal.
the
court
may
assume
for
purposes
of
this
case
of
that
access
could
be
absolutely
barred
and
that
the
principal
could
close
his
ears
or
become
a
hermit
if
he
wished
to.
i
would
only
add
that
the
expressions
in
this
case
were
especially
deserving
of
constitutional
protection.
the
petitioner
spoke
as
a
concerned
citizen
about
a
matter
of
public
importance
namely
the
respective
roles
of
blacks
and
whites
in
the
environment
of
the
school
located
in
the
school
district
then
under
court
order
desegregation
a
topic
of
intense
community
concern
at
the
time.
mr.
david
rubin
but
the
district
court's
finding
your
honor
was
that
the
primary
indeed
almost
the
entire
reason
was
her
communications
to
her
principal
not
--
he
didn't
make
a
finding
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
david
rubin
its
--
it
--
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
whether
she
refused
to
administer
this
--
standardized
test.
her
testimony
which
was
corroborated
by
other
--
another
teacher
and
a
guidance
councilor
was
to
the
effect
that
she
did
give
the
test
but
the
--
and
the
district
court
concluded
that
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
evidence
on
that
point
and
made
no
finding
on
it.
mr.
david
rubin
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
district
court
with
respect
to
its
factual
findings.
mr.
david
rubin
right.
the
petitioner
spoke
not
only
as
a
concerned
citizen
but
she
also
spoke
as
a
concerned
teacher.
she
was
concerned
with
the
impact
of
the
respective
roles
in
--
of
blacks
and
whites
in
the
school
environment
upon
the
learning
incentives
of
her
students.
this
is
--
in
a
school
more
than
90%
black
in
its
enrollment.
she
had
taught
black
students
for
many
years
in
the
dual
system
and
had
taught
in
both
segregated
and
in
desegregated
schools.
and
so
she
was
among
those
members
of
the
community
most
likely
to
have
an
informed
opinion
about
the
matters
that
she
criticized.
and
for
all
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
this
court
should
rule
that
the
constitution
protects
her
against
the
punishment,
this
punishment
for
expressing
her
ideas.
now
we
ask
that
the
court
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
with
instructions
to
reinstate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.
david
rubin
the
mt.
healthy
case
was
decided
between
the
briefing
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
argument
of
the
case
in
that
court.
the
respondents
ask
for
a
remand
in
light
of
that
case.
but
the
court
of
appeals
which
had
the
record
before
it
and
reviewing
that
record
concluded
that
there
was
no
serious
issue
requiring
a
remand
--
mr.
david
rubin
--
under
mt.
healthy.
and
it
--
it's
our
position
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
the
respondents
not
having
filed
any
cross-petition
of
the
issue
not
having
been
raised
than
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
respondents
not
having
raised
the
issue
in
the
opposition
to
certiorari,
that
certiorari
petition
that
this
court
will
not
consider
that
issue
now.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
rubin
no
your
honor,
i
waive
rebuttal.
