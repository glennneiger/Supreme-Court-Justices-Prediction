mr.
j.
robertshaw
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
basically,
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
reached
the
right
result
but
for
the
wrong
reason.
and
i
must
be
perfectly
candid
with
this
court
and
say
that
i
don't
think
that
the
first
amendment
protection
is
dependent
upon
the
forum
of
the
degree
on
publicity
or
in
the
manner
in
which
it's
exercised.
the
question
is
whether
the
communication
is
or
should
be
constitutionally
protected.
now,
i
would
like
to
take
about
two
minutes
and
put
this
case
in
proper
prospective.
first,
there
is
a
direct
relationship
between
the
quality
of
a
community
and
the
quality
of
its
public
education.
second,
you
can't
get
a
quality
education
without
quality
teachers.
now,
how
do
we
do
this?
in
mississippi,
a
teacher
is
employed
under
a
written
contract,
statutory.
she
may
not
be
paid
unless
she
has
a
written
contract.
during
the
time
of
that
contract
she
may
be
discharged
only
for
incompetence
or
immoral
conduct
for
a
brutal
treatment
of
a
pupil
for
a
willful
neglect
of
duties
of
for
other
good
cause.
and
our
courts
have
rightly
held
that
a
professional
contract
is
something
not
likely
to
be
done
away
with
and
that
the
statute
means
what
it
says.
but
at
the
end
of
the
contract
then
there
is
a
decision
as
to
whether
a
teacher
should
or
should
not
be
reemployed.
now,
basically,
this
question
is
one
of
management.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
in
this
case
should
have
been
reemployed
and
we
think
that
that
is
a
proper
decision
to
make
and
that
the
management
should
make
it
on
the
basis
of
daily
contact
over
a
long
period
of
time
that
the
courts
are
eloquent
to
make
a
contrary
judgment
based
solely
upon
evidence
in
a
record
that
is
put
on
in
a
formal
atmosphere
and
upon
his
personal
observation
of
the
teacher
on
a
stand
where
she
obviously
is
going
to
be.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
perry
v.
sindermann
was
a
nontenure
case.
this
is
a
nontenure
case.
and
in
perry
v.
sindermann,
this
court
held
that
a
teacher
could
not
be
denied
reemployment
because
of
exercise
of
constitutionally
protected
rights
and
remanded
that
case
for
a
determination
as
to
whether
that
in
fact
happened.
roth
as
i
understand
it
simply
held
that
a
teacher,
a
nontenured
teacher
had
no
right
to
continue
the
employment
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
as
i
under
--
as
i
recall
the
facts
of
the
two
cases,
both
roth
and
sindermann
were
nontenured
cases.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
now
in
--
mr.
j.
robertshaw
i
certainly
do
not.
and
it
might
be
helpful
for
the
court
to
follow
the
development
in
our
state.
other
law
to
its
present
form
which
specifically
holds
now
even
though
we
do
not
have
--
that
is
--
this
is
a
statute.
i
might
make
a
reference
to
it.
it's
called
a
school
employment
procedures
act.
and
it
specifically
says
that
a
nonreemployment
decision
may
not
be
based
upon
a
violation
of
a
teacher's
statutory
or
constitutional
right.
and
that
is
section
37-9-101,
the
school
employment
procedures
law
and
specifically
the
basis
upon
which
the
decision
may
be
reversed
is
section
37-9-113.
now,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
or
should
be
any
difference
between
the
constitutionally
protected
rights
of
a
public
employee
or
a
private
employee.
i
think
that
they're
exactly
the
same
and
to
the
extent
of
cases
that
have
been
decided
it
seemed
to
hold
that
a
public
employee
has
a
higher
right.
i
think
they're
wrong.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
i
think
that
the
same
rule
applies
to
a
private
merchant
as
it
does
to
a
public
employee,
no
more,
no
less.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
sir?
mr.
j.
robertshaw
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice
what
the
specifics
of
your
question
are.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
that
there
is
a
difference?
mr.
j.
robertshaw
i
think
we
must
--
misunderstand
each
other
if
you
will
pardon
me
but
i
think
i
agree
with
the
--
exactly
to
the
point
that
i
believe
you
are
making
and
that
is
if
they
are
treated
alike
on
the
law.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
sir?
mr.
j.
robertshaw
i
don't
know
of
any
case
--
mr.
j.
robertshaw
--
to
that
effect.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
i
agree.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
i
agree.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
well
--
mr.
j.
robertshaw
there
is
state
action
here
because
the
board
of
trustees
and
--
which
runs
this
is
harmless
to
state
government.
now,
we
concede
the
jurisdiction
in
this
case
sir.
now,
i
think
we
ought
to
look
in
determining
whether
this
was
a
proper
reemployment
decision
at
the
context
in
which
this
action
was
taken.
now,
mind
you,
we
do
not
criticize
mrs.
givhan
while
the
--
for
her
right
to
make
this.
our
objection
is
to
the
manner
and
the
circumstances
under
which
these
statements
were
made.
now,
this
school
started
out
in
the
fall
of
1969
--
mr.
j.
robertshaw
excuse
me.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
27;28
hard
of
hearing.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
that
is
absolutely
correct
--
mr.
j.
robertshaw
--
and
i
think
that's
what
the
judge
smith
found
when
he
said
she
was
overly
critical.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
yes
sir,
if
i
may
explain
my
acceptance.
at
that
time
the
district
court
was
bounded
by
sindermann
once
you
find
that
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
rights
forms
a
material
part
of
the
decision
then
under
sindermann,
he
had
to
reverse
this.
he
had
the
hold
against
it.
but
he
says
the
primary
reason,
now,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
on
the
mt.
healthy
v.
doyle,
this
court
held
under
--
which
also
was
a
tenure
case
that
the
district
court
should
have
gone
further
and
made
a
specific
finding
as
to
whether
the
board
would
have
not
rehired
the
teacher
independently
of
the
constitutional
protection
rights.
so
that
--
so
far
as
judge
smith's
finding
is
concerned,
if
he
said
it's
a
primary
reason
then
he
is
bound
under
perryman
--
i
mean
under
perry
v.
sindermann.
but
we
want
the
fighting
chance
to
show
that
we
would
not
have
rehired
her
anyhow.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
i
did
but
you
must
realize
that
the
rejection
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
dictum
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
held
there
was
no
violation
of
first
amendment
rights.
so
consequently
having
held
to
that
there
was
no
violation
of
rights
then
there
would
be
no
reason
for
remand.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
yes.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
no.
you've
got
to
look
at
pickering
--
mr.
j.
robertshaw
i
apologize.
you've
got
to
look
at
pickering
for
what
it
is.
pickering
is
a
discharge
case
not
a
reemployment
case.
now,
we
say
even
under
pickering
under
the
facts
of
this
case
under
the
necessity
for
a
close
working
relationship
between
a
principal
and
a
teacher
that
the
conduct
of
this
teacher,
some
of
which
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
some
of
which
was
not
put
it
in
such
a
situation
that
the
principal
testified
that
he
knew
he
had
to
run
that
school
the
following
year.
and
that
he
felt
he
couldn't
do
it
with
mrs.
givhan
present
and
that
for
that
reason
he
didn't
recommend
her.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
i
am
not
defending
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
extent
that
it
holds
that
private
communications
between
an
employee
and
an
employer
are
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
i'm
--
no,
to
be
perfectly
frank
your
honor,
this
is
my
first
appearance
before
this
court.
i
had
to
be
--
i
did
not
know
that
if
i
wanted
to
raise
a
point
i
had
to
file
a
cross-petition.
but
i
do
think
that
this
court
certainly
has
the
power
to
determine
the
rules
that
should
govern
situations
of
this
type
and
remand
the
case
to
the
fifth
circuit
or
to
the
district
court
or
proceedings
consistent
with
your
opinion.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
i
think
in
the
interest
to
basic
fairness
they
should
be
and
for
this
reason.
the
district
court's
decision
was
july
the
2nd,
of
1975.
our
replied
brief
--
mr.
j.
robertshaw
no,
i
don't
think
that
the
record
is
sufficient.
i
think
that
it
should
be
remanded
under
doyle,
because
in
doyle
you
said
to
the
district
court
you
should
have
looked
into
this.
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
had
no
way
in
the
world
of
anticipating
doyle
which
was
not
decided
until
january
of
1977.
now,
let
me
touch
briefly
on
the
type
of
comment
we
are
talking
about
and
it
is
i
believe
a
significant
fact
in
one
that
i
had
completely
overlooked
until
preparing
in
what
i
hope
to
some
depths
for
this.
and
that
is
that
the
district
court
in
its
orders
in
january
of
1970
had
retained
a
specific
jurisdiction
for
the
entry
of
any
other
orders
that
might
be
necessary.
it
had
full
jurisdiction
over
the
cases.
so
if
in
fact
the
respondent
district
had
been
guilty
of
discrimination
in
the
handling
of
its
administrative
personnel
in
glen
allan
if
in
fact
they
have
been
guilty
of
discrimination
in
handling
of
the
nyc
workers.
or
if
in
fact
it
had
been
guilty
of
discrimination
in
assigning
a
white
to
take
up
tickets
in
the
cafeteria
then
that
should
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
and
was
not.
and
i
say
to
you
that
it
was
not
brought
to
the
district
court
for
corrective
action
because
there
was
no
need.
now
as
i
understand
it,
those
are
the
three
points
on
which
they
claim
first
amendment
protection.
let
me
take
the
to
nyc
workers.
the
nyc
workers
are
hired
by
the
employment
service
and
referred
on
the
basis
of
their
qualifications
to
schools.
we
can
employ
them
where
we
are
told
to
employ
them.
now,
all
of
the
nyc
workers
were
black.
so
you
couldn't
say
that
we
were
discriminating
in
the
assignment.
now
this
leaves
to
the
objection
that
there
were
not
enough
black
faces
in
the
administrative
office.
now
this
was
as
school
of
530
odd
pupils.
the
administrative
staff
consisted
of
the
principal
who
was
white,
the
assistant
principal
who
was
black,
the
elementary
supervisor
who
was
black
and
the
guidance
councilor
for
the
school
who
was
black
and
one
white
secretary.
now,
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
we
were
discriminating
there.
now,
let's
look
at
the
assignment
of
people
to
the
cafeteria.
the
objection
is
that
the
person
who
took
up
the
tickets
had
"the
choice
position".
but
the
facts
are
that
that
white
was
the
only
person
employed
at
the
cafeteria
of
the
white
race,
the
manager
was
black.
all
other
employees
were
black.
the
white
had
been
hired
on
the
recommendation
or
appointment
rather
of
the
black
cafeteria
manager
made
to
the
cafeteria
supervisor.
now,
if
we
had
been
discriminating
them,
the
court
could
have
taken
corrective
action.
now,
really
what
we
are
getting
down
to
you
is
that
we
have
a
teacher
and
we'd
make
no
argument
that
she
was
not
a
competent
teacher
so
long
as
she
stayed
within
the
scope
of
our
employment
but
a
teacher
who
was
constantly
interfering
with
the
operation
of
the
schools
under
circumstances
that
we're
trying.
i
didn't
complete
the
picture
in
the
middle
of
the
69-70
this
entire
district
was
shaken
up.
all
seven
through
12
people
went
to
riverside
which
was
the
center
and
the
middle
at
the
north,
o'bannon,
all
and
one
through
six
pupils,
at
glen
allan
in
the
south
all
one
through
six
in
that
zone.
it
was
so
bad
that
a
consent
decree
was
entered
during
the
summer
and
we
reconstituted
this
district
at
that
time
by
agreement.
now,
in
your
normal
school
situation,
a
kid
goes
in,
in
the
first
grade
and
he
makes
his
associations,
the
teachers
have
worked
together.
there
are
peer
groups
formed.
there
is
a
comfortable
atmosphere.
now,
during
the
year
in
question,
the
year
following
which
petitioner
was
not
rehired,
that
was
the
fall
opening
in
the
new
one
through
12
configuration.
they
didn't
even
have
a
principal
down
there
for
the
first
four
to
five
weeks.
things
were
in
confusion.
there
was
no
discipline.
students
were
walking
in
the
hall.
and
the
first
and
most
paramount
duty
was
to
recreate
an
atmosphere
conducive
to
the
education
of
the
pupils
and
to
get
on
with
the
business
of
giving
the
best
possible
education
to
the
students
of
the
district
in
there.
i
think
we've
--
not
a
good
job
moving.
but
in
order
to
do
it
you
got
to
have
teachers
that
will
cooperate.
you
will
have
teachers
that
will
not
protest
the
giving
of
routine
test
such
as
the
six
weeks
test
or
semester
test
doesn't
make
any
difference
which.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
well,
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted
and
it's
admitted
by
petitioner.
there
was
no
finding
on
it.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
the
finding
was
that
we
had
a
--
mr.
j.
robertshaw
because
she
was
a
vocal
critic.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
and
because
we
had
--
now
what
is
the
--
i've
been
unable
to
--
mr.
j.
robertshaw
sir?
mr.
j.
robertshaw
on
page
35a,
however
when
the
school
district's
decision,
this
is
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
as
the
court
please.
when
the
school
district's
decision
to
terminate
givhan's
employment
is
placed
in
the
setting
contemporaneous
with
it's
conception
and
execution
it
becomes
clear
to
the
court
that
the
school
district's
motivation
in
failing
to
renew
givhan's
contract
was
almost
entirely
a
desire
to
rid
themselves
of
a
vocal
critic
of
the
district
policies
and
practices
which
were
capable
of
interpretation
as
embodying
a
racial
discrimination.
the
court
conceives
this
to
be
a
violation
of
givhan's
right
under
the
first
amendment,
perry
v.
sindermann.
now
--
mr.
j.
robertshaw
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
j.
robertshaw
sir?
mr.
j.
robertshaw
i
--
mr.
j.
robertshaw
no
sir,
that
--
mr.
j.
robertshaw
no
sir,
that
is
my
--
that
is
not
my
petition.
i
think
that
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
administration
of
a
successful
school
that
there'd
be
a
free
interchange
between
a
teacher
and
a
principal
of
ideas
and
criticisms
with
the
idea
of
something
constructive.
but
i
do
not
think
that
in
the
presence
of
students
in
the
--
while
classes
are
being
changed
that
--
that's
where
--
or
the
circumstances
under
which
certain
conduct
should
take
place.
mr.
j.
robertshaw
does
this
mean
that
i
--
oh,
i
see.
are
there
question
from
the
court?
