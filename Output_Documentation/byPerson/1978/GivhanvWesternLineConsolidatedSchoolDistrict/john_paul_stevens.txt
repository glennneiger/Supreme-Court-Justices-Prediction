stevens
mr.
robertshaw,
could
i
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
just
ask
one
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that
the
decision
was
not
based
on
what
she
said
but
rather
the
manner
in
which
she
said
it
as
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
not
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
not
the
judge
say
that
the
--
in
page
35a
of
the
certiorari
petition
that
as
a
finder
of
fact
after
hearing
all
the
testimony
in
reviewing
the
exhibits
he
concluded
that
the
primary
reason
for
the
school
district's
failure
to
renew
her
contract
was
her
criticism
with
the
policies
and
factors
of
the
school
district.
do
you
accept
that
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
not
--
you
make
precisely
this
argument
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
rejected
this
very
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
is
it
really
a
dictum
because
if
they
were
--
if
you
had
prevailed
on
that
argument
they
would
not
have
had
to
decide
the
constitutional
issue
they
decide
that
argument.
if
you
had
prevailed
it
would
have
enabled
them
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issue
and
would
it
not
be
good
practice
for
an
appellate
court
to
see
if
they
couldn't
avoid
the
constitutional
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
really
not
a
dictum
in
the
ordinary
sense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
robertshaw,
let
me
ask
one
other
question
and
i
don't
mean
to
take
too
much
time
but
you
are
not
defending
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
are
you?
the
judgment
being
that
she
--
her
claim
must
fail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
are
asking
us
without
having
filed
a
cross-petition
for
certiorari
to
modify
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals?
