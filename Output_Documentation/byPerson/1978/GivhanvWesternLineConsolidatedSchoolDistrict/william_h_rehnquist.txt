justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
just
have
a
suggestion
box
type
of
thing?
say
that
any
teacher
can
put
suggestions
in
the
suggestion
box
if
she
wishes
to
address
to
the
principal
but
there's
no
guarantee
that
the
principal
is
going
to
have
time
to
read
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
are
--
(a)
why
must
there
be
limits
and
(b)
why
must
there
be
regulations
if
in
a
normal
course
of
the
teacher-principal
relationship
the
teacher
knows
that
the
principal
say
has
a
meeting
from
four
to
five
and
she
comes
up
to
him
at
one
minute
to
four
and
says,
look,
this
policy
that
you're
enforcing
seems
to
be
all
bad
and
i
don't
think
it's
consistent
with
a
constitution?
the
principal
says,
sorry,
i'd
rather
go
to
this
meeting,
some
other
time
maybe,
but
not
now?
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
but
don't
you
get
some
sense
out
of
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
that
the
reason
for
the
discharge
here
was
that
the
teacher
was
more
or
less
bugging
the
principal
rather
than
the
--
for
the
content
of
her
suggestion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we'll
deal
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
the
appeals
not
with
the
district
court's
opinion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
it
didn't
find
that
the
petitioner
harassed
but
it
certainly
intimate
--
at
least
i
got
the
intimation
of
it
that
the
reason
for
the
discharge
wasn't
these
--
so
much
the
communication
or
the
conduct
of
the
communication
is
just
the
very
unseemly
times
and
demands
on
the
principal's
time.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
must
rise
to
a
level
of
harassment
before
one
could
discharge
an
employee
because
the
employee
insist
upon
more
or
less
taking
up
time
that
the
superior
wishes
to
devote
to
other
affairs.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rubin,
you
represent
only
givhan
and
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
school
district
authorizes
the
principal
to
say
to
the
teachers,
"look,
i
just
don't
want
to
hear
from
you
at
all,
you
teach
and
i'll
supervise
and
that's
it.
you
can
say
what
you
want
to,
any
place
you
want
to
but
just
don't
bother
me
with
it".
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
would
you
phrase
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
free
speech
duty
and
the
principal
to
listen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
our
roth
and
perry
cases
we
held
that
a
teacher
could
not
be
denied
renewal
of
her
contract
for
reasons
that
violated
the
first
amendment,
did
we
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
roth,
the
district
court
had
reserved
ruling
on
the
teacher's
first
amendment
complaint.
and
simply,
the
case
had
come
up
here
on
the
claim
that
there
had
been
a
right
--
denial
of
property
right
in
a
tenure
and
we
held
that
--
define
tenure
and
said
that
just
an
expectation
is
in
tenure.
but
even
a
nontenured
teacher
can
be
--
cannot
be
fired
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
you
have
an
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
you
have
an
employee
whose
clearly
understood,
who
has
a
contract
at
will
that
can
be
terminated
tomorrow
by
the
state
employer
and
the
clearly
established
reason
for
termination
is
because
he
makes
a
statement
on
some
public
issue
that
offends
the
employer.
do
you
think
that
this
employer
can
simply
rely
on
the
doctrine
that
he
had
had
no
contractual
right
to
be
--
continued
in
employment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
--
a
grocery
merchant
can't
fire
his
clerk
because
the
clerk
says
something
about
a
public
issue
that
the
merchant
doesn't
like?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
is
very
specific,
and
that
is
do
you
know
of
any
case
from
this
court
that
supports
the
proposition
you
just
stated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
there's
no
difference
which
was
what
i
understood
from
your
proposition.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case,
petitioner
givhan
was
a
junior
high
school
english
teacher
in
a
rural
consolidated
school
district
in
northern
mississippi.
when
the
school
district
fired
her,
she
filed
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
mississippi
seeking
reinstatement
on
the
grounds
that
nonrenewal
of
her
first
amendment
right
to
freedom
of
speech.
in
an
effort
to
show
that
its
decision
was
justified,
the
school
district
introduced
evidence
of
a
series
of
run-ins
between
petitioner
and
the
school
principal.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
teacher,
petitioner
in
this
case,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
that
judgment
and
ruled
in
favor
of
the
school
district.
it
decided
that
since
the
teacher's
expressions
of
views
had
been
conveyed
privately
to
the
principal,
that
expression
was
not
protected
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution.
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
although
most
if
not
all
of
our
previous
first
amendment
cases
have
involved
public
expression
on
the
part
of
a
government
employee,
that
largely
coincidental
fact
was
not
critical
to
the
those
decisions.
nor
is
the
court
of
appeals'
view
supported
by
the
captive
audience
rationale
for
having
agreed
to
listen
to
the
teacher's
views,
the
principal
was
hardly
in
the
position
to
argue
that
he
was
an
unwilling
recipient
of.
the
first
amendment
forbids
governmental
abridgment
of
the
freedom
of
speech
whether
that
speech
is
expressed
publicly
to
the
world
at
large
or
privately
to
other
individuals.
we
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
however
for
consideration
of
the
school
district's
claim
that
petitioner's
contract
would
not
have
been
renewed
even
if
her
private
encounters
with
the
principal
had
not
taken
place.
mr.
justice
stevens
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
