they
don't
agree
the
judgment
was
wrong?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
isn't
unusual
to
find
that
the
respondents
don't
entirely
defend
a
--
their
reasoning.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
wants
to
debate
on
whether
you
should
affirm
or
reverse?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
if
they
--
what
if
we
decided
they
used
the
wrong
standard,
why
shouldn't
we
remand
and
let
them
deal
with
it
first?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
in
light
of
whatever's
standard
we
thought
was
applicable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
protects
us
against
governmental
action
not
against
private
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
don't
think
that
--
you
don't
think
that
its
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
in
saying
that
as
of
--
that
on
this
record
the
petitioner
should
be
--
is
out
of
court.
do
you
think
there
should
be
some
further
proceedings
go
on
before
her
rights
are
terminated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
don't
believe
the
record
that's
before
us
is
sufficient
for
us
to
make
any
--
at
least
you
don't
insist
that
we
make
any
determination
here
based
on
a
new
--
on
a
different
standard
in
the
court
of
appeals.
