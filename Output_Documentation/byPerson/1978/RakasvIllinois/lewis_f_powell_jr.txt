that's
the
presence
or
absence
of
probable
cause
that
make
any
difference
in
this
type
of
situation?
justice

all
right

justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
all
right,
but
let's
assume
for
the
moment
there
was
probable
cause
to
stop
this
automobile,
would
you
still
be
making
the
same
issue
with
respect
to
standing
to
conduct
a
sort
of
pat
down
search
that
was
approved
in
robinson?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
would
that
have
been
permissible
or
would
the
individual
who
were
patted
down
after
the
vehicle
had
been
stopped
with
probable
cause
have
standing
to
object?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
the
question
--
about
your
adversary.
what
about
the
driver
of
the
stolen
car?
