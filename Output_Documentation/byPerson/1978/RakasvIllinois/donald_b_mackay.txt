mr.
donald
b.
mackay
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
grant
standing
to
the
petitioners
here,
we
feel
would
constitute
a
radical
departure
from
the
well-reasoned
and
readily
enforceable
rule
of
standing
which
is
currently
based
on
the
right
of
privacy
concept.
the
dictates
of
public
policy,
we
submit
your
honors,
strongly
support
the
continued
application
of
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
standard.
to
expand
standing
as
petitioners
would
suggest
under
a
directed
at
theory
would
simply
be
to
say
to
anyone
charged
with
a
crime
that
he
may
mount
a
challenge
to
a
search
which
could
not
have
conceivably
affected
his
personal
interest
and
privacy.
this
approach
your
honors
we
believe
would
abandon
the
traditional
rationale
behind
the
fourth
amendment
cases;
that
is
the
primacy
of
the
protection
of
privacy
and
would
replace
it
with
a
cumbersome
standard
of
expediency.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
your
honor,
in
order
to
answer
that
question,
i
think
we
have
to
look
to
what
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
the
guest
had.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
it
is
our
position
your
honor
that
mr.
justice
white
that
simmons
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
is
it
simmons?
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
that
simmons
although
it
--
excuse
me,
i'm
getting
confused.
that
jones,
although
it
purports
to
have
language
to
the
effect
that
one
legitimately
on
the
premises
automatically
has
standing
by
virtue
of
that
alone
is
only
dicta
in
jones
and
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
then,
i
would
submit
to
mr.
justice
white
that
this
court
should
seriously
consider
abandoning.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
not
only
that,
but
because
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
no,
we
do
not
concede
that
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
yes
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
correct.
well,
you
don't
have
to
answer
my
question
but
my
question
was
directed
that
as
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
whether
--
i
just
want
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
that's
correct.
i
agree
that
that
is
what
the
dictum
in
jones
says.
i
disagree
that
that's
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
yes,
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
that's
correct.
this
court
has
held
that
fourth
amendment
rights
were
private
and
may
not
be
vicariously
asserted.
to
get
back
to
something
which
i
think
is
suggested
by
mr.
justice
white's
question
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
or
by
jones.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
it
is
the
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
the
desire
position
your
honor.
but
we
see
a
distinction
your
honors
between
the
privacy
or
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
that
one
enjoys
in
his
home
or
in
a
residence
and
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
that
a
passenger
in
an
automobile
should
enjoy.
and
it
is
our
position
your
honors
that
the
petitioners
here
lack
a
sufficient
expectation
of
privacy
to
object
to
the
search
and
seizure
as
being
an
invasion
of
their
privacy.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
then
he
has
standing
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
then
under
our
argument
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
individual
would
have
standing
because
his
privacy
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
and
that
vehicle
is
being
violated.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
well,
i
suggest
that
as
the
owner
of
the
vehicle,
he
has
a
paramount
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
contents
of
his
vehicle
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
yes
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
well,
we
take
the
position
that
it
is
not
your
honor
that
a
passenger
in
an
automobile
has
a
diminished
expectation
of
privacy.
the
paramount
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
exactly
what
i
responded
to
mr.
justice
white.
we
are
here
attempting
to
draw
a
distinction
between
what
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
is.
now,
i
take
issue
with
the
dicta
in
jones
that
one
legitimately
on
the
premises
by
virtue
of
that
fact
alone
should
be
found
to
have
standing
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
this
court
reads
that
to
be
the
law
of
jones,
that
this
court
should
then
overrule
that
to
the
extent
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
our
position.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
yes
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
i
believe
it
turns
on
expectation
of
privacy
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
no,
because
it
is
our
position
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stevens
that
the
owner
of
the
car
--
assuming
he
is
present
in
your
hypothetical.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
has
a
paramount
right
of
expectation
of
privacy
to
the
contents
of
that
vehicle.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
the
operator
of
the
car
and
perhaps
on
the
theory
of
agency
that
he
is
the
agent
of
the
driver
maybe
placed
in
the
shoes
of
the
owner
as
being
the
surrogate
owner
to
assert
the
right
of
privacy.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
no
your
honor,
i'm
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
as
to
the
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
as
to
leased
modes
of
transportation
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
only
way
i
think
i
can
answer
your
question
is
to
respond
that
the
lessee
here
is
the
surrogate
owner
who
has
a
--
the
primacy,
the
primary
protection
of
the
interest
of
privacy
in
that
vehicle
or
airplane.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
well
i'm
sorry.
your
honors,
returning
again
to
the
degree
of
expectation
of
privacy
that
one
may
reasonably
expect
as
a
passenger
in
an
automobile,
we
should
take
into
consideration
that
the
primary
purpose
of
an
automobile
as
this
court
has
recognized
is
transportation.
an
automobile
seldom
serves
as
ones
residence
or
as
the
repository
for
ones
personal
effects
with
papers.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
yes
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
and
i
believe
that
mr.
chief
justice
that
your
latest
--
your
comment
gives
more
force
to
our
argument
that
the
rights
of
passengers
on
an
automobile
to
privacy
are
significantly
diminished.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
essentially
yes
mr.
justice
stewart
with
the
qualification
that
someone
acting
as
the
owner's
agent
in
possessing
or
driving
the
automobile
would
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
right.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
your
honor
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
in
that
--
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
the
petitioners
never
alleged
that
they
were
entitled
the
possession
of
the
car.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
yes.
and
for
instance
in
this
case,
if
the
petitioners
were
to
have
demonstrated
to
the
trial
court
that
they
were
in
joint
possession.
if
you
want
to
indulge
in
such
a
concept,
i
would
have
no
quarrel.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
well,
but
i
would
have
no
quarrel
with
granting
them
standing
at
least
to
challenge
the
legality
of
the
search.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
well
in
that
case
mr.
justice
stevens,
you're
then
talking
about
a
possessory
offense.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
--
and
we
bring
into
play
the
remaining
language
in
jones
which
is
not
been
dealt
with
in
simmons.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
no,
not
really
on
property
concepts
mr.
justice
stevens
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
well
your
honor,
it
may
be
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
i
will
concede
that
with
this
clarification.
i
know
of
no
practical
way
to
determine
the
underlying
legal
factual
question
as
to
the
--
what
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
anyone
has
in
a
particular
location
under
particular
circumstances
without
at
some
point
reverting
to
property
concepts
in
order
to
make
that
distinction.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that.
if
the
individuals
have
personally
been
searched,
their
individual
right
to
remain
free
from
unreasonable
searches
has
been
violated,
but
when
the
automobile
is
searched
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
that's
correct.
being
legitimately
on
the
premises,
we
submit
without
more,
is
insufficient
to
confer
standing
on
these
petitioners.
this
concept
presupposes
that
one
who
is
“legitimately
on
the
premises”
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
premises
and
in
its
contents,
anywhere
in
the
premises
simply
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
or
she
is
there.
it
is
our
belief
your
honors
that
this
court
when
it
decided
jones
versus
united
states
in
1960
did
not
intend
to
create
such
a
rule
notwithstanding
the
very
clear
english
language
contained
in
jones
to
the
effect
that
the
court
was
considering
two
separate
grounds
for
standing.
i
think
we
must
remember
that
jones,
first
of
all,
was
attempting
to
define
an
aggrieved
person
under
rule
41
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
it
dealt
with
a
possessory
offense
where
it
felt
that
the
vise
of
prosecutorial
self
contradiction
and
the
potential
for
self-incrimination
required
the
court
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
to
grant
standing
to
the
petitioner
in
that
case.
the
court
found
in
jones
that
the
same
possession
which
would
grant
standing
was
the
very
same
possession
which
would
convict.
i
might
also
point
out
that
jones
which
was
decided
in
1960
was
decided
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
mapp
v.
ohio
which
came
the
following
year,
and
i
just
doubt
your
honors
whether
this
court
in
1960
when
it
announced
jones
intended
to
formulate
a
rule
of
standing.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
your
honor,
the
only
way
i
can
answer
that
is
to
refer
the
court
to
the
dissent
of
justice
black
in
mancusi
versus
deforte
where
he
labels
the
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
i
understand
that.
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
if
this
court
finds
that
is
the
rule
in
jones,
then
jones
should
be
modified
by
the
opinion
in
this
case
to
strike
being
legitimately
on
the
premises
as
an
independent
ground
for
standing
because
the
factors
which
were
present
in
jones
to
give
rise
to
that
are
no
longer
in
existence.
we
now
under
simmons,
we
no
longer
have
the
potential
for
self-incrimination.
we
still
have
left
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
that's
right.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
brown,
there
is
language
in
brown
would
suggest
that
the
continued
vitality
of
jones
in
light
of
simmons
is
questionable
in
non
--
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
now,
the
way
i
read
your
honor
--
the
way
i
read
brown
your
honor
is
that
it
reserves
--
excuse
me?
mr.
donald
b.
mackay
it
reserves
for
future
consideration
the
application
of
jones
type
standing
only
to
possessory
offenses.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
non-possessory
offense.
i
think
what
the
court
is
suggesting
in
brown
is
that
the
jones
type
standing
is
no
longer
required
in
a
non-possessory
offense.
thank
you
your
honor.
