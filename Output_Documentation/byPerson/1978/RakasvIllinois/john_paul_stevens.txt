other
that
you've
never
been
in
the
premises
you
don't
have
to
decide
whether
you're
legitimately
on
the
premise?
justice
john

mr.
mackay,
i
have
to
confess
i'm
somewhat
puzzled.
do
you
think
the
standing
turns
on
property
concepts
are
expectation
of
privacy
concepts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then,
you
would
not
differentiate
if
you
have
four
people
riding
in
a
car
11
o'clock
at
night
out
in
the
country
somewhere,
you'd
say
they
all
have
precisely
the
same
expectation
of
privacy
regardless
of
who
owns
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
assume
we
will
take
it
in
both
ways.
would
you
suggest
he
has
an
expectation
that
he's
not
present
but
the
four
people
present
have
no
expectation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
regardless
of
whether
he
is
present?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
persons
present
never
have
an
expectation
of
privacy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
a
passenger
in
a
taxi
cab,
he'd
never
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
i
guess.
open
season
on
taxi
cabs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he's
indicted
for
possession
of
the
gun.
that
would
have
made
it
a
difference
when
it's
bank
robbery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me,
if
i
understand
your
argument
correctly,
you're
saying
in
with
respect
to
non-possessory
offences
that
standing
turns
on
property
concepts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
kind
of
asking
the
court
to
go
back
to
pre-caps
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ownership's
possession,
agent
of
owner
and
all
that,
but
the
privacy
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it
because
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
used
the
word
privacy
to
say
its
present
when
you're
an
owner
but
there
is
no
privacy
present
when
you're
a
non-owner
and
a
non-agent.
so
in
final
analysis,
you're
making
a
property
type
analysis
but
using
the
word
privacy
to
describe,
which
is
pre-caps
analysis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
a
judge
could
come
to
the
conclusion
that
when
four
or
five
people
are
riding
along
in
a
car,
the
car
stopped
and
everybody
is
ordered
out
of
the
car
and
everybody
searched
that
they
could
feel
that
there
has
been
some
infringement
of
their
constitutional
rights.
you
don't
think
a
judge
could
make
that
kind
of
a
determination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
just
the
vehicle
is
searched,
they
don't
have
any
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
if
you
assumed
there
is
no
probable
cause,
it
still
doesn't
do
your
client
any
good
if
he
has
no
standing.
the
search
could
be
grossly
illegal
and
he
still
has
nothing
to
complain
about.
