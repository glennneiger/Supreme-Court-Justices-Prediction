justice
potter
stewart
because
as
i
understand
that
the
validity
of
this
search
has
never
been
determined
by
the
lower
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
even
if
we
decided
in
your
favor,
all
you
ask
us
to
do
is
to
remand
it
to
the
state
court
that
yes,
the
--
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
search,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
--
that's
not
before
us
not
at
all,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
although
it
fact,
it
was
a
possessory
offense
in
jones
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
dilemma
perceived
in
the
jones'
opinion,
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
for
the
court
in
jones
was
eliminated
and
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
for
the
court
in
silence;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
may
not
have
the
identification
of
the
members
of
the
court
exactly
correctly;
that's
my
recollection.
but
in
any
event,
the
simmons'
decision
eliminated
the
perceived
dilemma
in
jones,
the
dilemma
perceived
by
the
opinion
in
jones,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
had
only
to
do
with
possessory
offenses?
justice
potter
stewart
but
with
respect
to
possessory
offenses
that
simmons
made
clear
that
a
person
didn't
have
to
in
fact
admit
possession
in
order
to
try
to
exclude
the
evidence,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
dilemma
perceived
in
jones?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
right,
it
simmons.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
depends
upon
--
is
it
necessary
to
make
such
a
general
rule
if
depends
upon
what
the
search
was
on
or
been
the
house
if
it
was
a
search
of
the
guest
suitcase
or
pajamas
or
hip
pocket
is
one
thing.
if
it
was
a
search
of
the
owners
of
the
house's
wine
cellar,
it's
something
else,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
--
you
don't
have
to
talk
about
the
expectations
of
privacy,
just
talk
about
whose
fourth
amendment
right
was
violated
and
adversely
for
the
fourth
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
proper
answer
yes
or
no?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
the
real
test
of
standing
is
whose
fourth
amendment
right
was
violated?
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
person
has
a
fourth
amendment
right
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
in
this
person's
papers
and
effects,
and
forgetting
about
person
for
a
moment
because
that's
not
involved
here,
that's
an
arrest
situation.
there
his
papers
or
his
effects,
if
he
has
ownership
of
them,
titled
to
them,
or
if
he
has
possession
of
them,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
if
he's
a
stranger
to
either
title
of
possession,
his
fourth
amendment
rights
can
hardly
be
violated,
can
they?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
passenger
had
been
the
title
owner
of
the
automobile?
justice
potter
stewart
even
riding
in
the
backseat
as
a
passenger,
but
the
fact
is
he
owns
the
automobile?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
his
ownership
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
his
privacy
was
no
more
violated
in
the
one
case
and
than
in
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
has
a
right
not
to
have
his
automobile
victimize
by
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizures.
justice
potter
stewart
john
smith
doesn't
have
a
right
that
that
other
fellow's
automobile
not
be
subjected
to
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure;
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
you
do
a
privacy,
the
privacy
interest
is
the
same
in
both
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
your
submission
that
nobody
but
the
record
owner
of
an
automobile
has
standing
to
complain
of
a
search
or
seizure
of
that
automobile?
justice
potter
stewart
somebody
driving
it
with
the
owner's
permission
and
who
is
the
only
person
in
the
automobile,
and
therefore
clearly
has
sole
possession
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
also
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
anybody
who
is
in
fact
in
possession
of
the
automobile?
justice
potter
stewart
you
might
have
a
quarrel,
but
it
would
be
a
harder
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
robbers,
how
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
steals
a
car
and
is
driving
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
in
fact
in
possession
and
let's
says
he
is
on
sole
exclusively
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
the
issue
on
the
merits
that's
decided
on
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
he
conceives
there
is
probable
cause,
he
is
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
going
to
object
to
it.
