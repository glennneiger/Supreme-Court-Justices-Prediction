justice
byron
r.
white
you
will
argue
that
next
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
guest
in
the
house
and
the
search
to
the
house,
does
the
guest
have
standing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
there
is
no
general
rule
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
isn't?
what
if
we
thought
that
was
the
general
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
might
govern
the
case
for
the
automobile
or
guest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
so,
but
it
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
i
had
a
guest
in
the
house
and
if
he
were
had
standing
to
object
to
a
search,
but
then
left
and
i
was
taking
him
home
and
there
was
a
search
in
my
car,
he
would
have
as
much
of
a
standing
in
the
car
to
object
in
the
search
to
car
as
to
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
agree
that
the
dictum
in
jones
indicated
that
the
guest
has
--
may
have
standing.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
view
of
--
and
to
the
extent
that
is
the
law
would
it
be
as
applicable
to
an
automobile
as
to
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
i
really
wanted
to
know,
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
your
honor.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
by
jones.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
mr.
justice
stewart's
presentation
is
--
he
represents
a
law,
the
dictum
is
obviously
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
passenger
in
its
motion
to
suppress
says
i
was
in
possession,
i
was
a
passenger
but
i
was
in
possession
of
the
automobile
because
i
had
borrowed
it
from
somebody
or
i
have
leased
it
from
somebody
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
i
have
stolen
it
from
somebody?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
of
those
circumstances,
you
would
think
he
had
standing?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
he's
alleged
that
he
was
in
possession
of
the
gun.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
he
had
alleged
that
he
was
in
possession
of
the
gun.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
say
about
brown?
brown
against
united
states,
411
u.s.
here's
the
footnote,
“presence
of
the
defendant
at
the
search
and
seizure
was
held
in
jones
to
be
a
sufficient
source
of
standing
in
itself”,
and
that
proceeds
to
say
that
of
course
in
brown,
there
was
the
defendant
was
not
in
the
premises
at
the
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
this
is
a
court
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
residing
what
the
--
reporting
to
say
what
one
of
the
court
holdings
is
and
announcing
of
what
the
existing
rule
of
lawyers.
perhaps
that
didn't
approve
it
but
it
certainly
indicated
it
was
a
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
ground
called
simmons,
after
simmons?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
in
the
automatic
standing
taken
with
regard
to
possession.
justice
byron
r.
white
nothing
go
ahead,
i'm
sorry.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
that
if
i
steal
a
car
and
i'm
driving
down
the
road
and
the
policeman
just
stops
the
car
without
probable
cause
and
searches
it
that
i
can
object
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
very
strategic,
very
strategic.
