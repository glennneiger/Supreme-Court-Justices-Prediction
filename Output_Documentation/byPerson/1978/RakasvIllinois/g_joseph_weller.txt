mr.
g.
joseph
weller
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
rather
passengers
who
were
legitimately
present
in
an
automobile
that
was
stopped
by
a
police
have
standing
the
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
warrantless
search
of
that
automobile.
we
advance
two
grounds
for
such
standings;
one
is
the
legitimately
present
on
the
premises
rule,
and
the
other
is
the
directed
that
theory
for
standing.
the
facts
in
this
case
can
be
briefly
stated.
the
two
petitioners
in
this
case,
frank
rakas
and
linnie
king
were
convicted
of
armed
robbery
in
an
illinois
court,
and
the
most
significant
evidence
against
them
was
a
sawed-off
rifle,
which
was
identified
by
one
of
the
victims
of
the
robber
has
being
the
same
weapon
which
was
used
by
the
mask
robbers.
the
two
robbers
in
the
robbery
in
question
made
their
getaway
from
the
site
of
the
robbery
in
a
blue
plymouth
roadrunner
which
was
taken
from
one
of
the
robbery
victims.
about
10
or
15
minutes
later,
the
policemen
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
the
car
was
subsequently
abandoned.
however,
prior
to
that
time,
the
police
officer
who
was
about
four
miles
north
of
the
robbery
site
noticed
a
--
not
a
blue
roadrunner
but
a
purple
roadrunner
with
a
different
license
number.
he
followed
this
vehicle
to
a
lounge,
saw
the
petitioners
and
two
female
companions
exit
and
go
into
the
lounge,
and
then
he
returned
to
his
original
site
near
the
highway
to
look
for
the
real
getaway
car
since
he
knew
it
was
a
different
license
number.
about
that
time,
he
heard
a
radio
call
noting
that
the
getaway
car
had
been
found
abandoned,
so
he
considered
the
possibility
that
the
robbers
changed
cars.
he
went
back
to
the
lounge,
called
the
sheriffs
and
dispatcher
for
a
description
of
the
suspects.
he
was
not
given
a
description,
instead
he
gave
him
his
description
of
the
petitioners
who
he
had
seen
and
he
was
told
that
one
of
the
petitioners
who
i
believe
would
be
mr.
king
matched
the
description
of
one
of
the
robbers.
as
a
matter
of
fact
however,
we
learn
from
the
trial
that
the
robbers
in
this
case
were
wore
ski
mask
and
they
wore
clothing
different
from
what
the
petitioners
from
wearing
at
the
time
of
their
arrest.
in
any
event,
police
officer
waited
until
petitioners
left
the
lounge.
he
followed
their
car
down
the
highway
toward
the
robbery
site,
and
it
was
near
the
site
in
which
a
number
of
police
vehicles
stopped
the
car
in
which
petitioners
were
riding
and
the
search
and
question
was
conducted.
now
during
the
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
in
my
opinion,
there
was
not
an
arrest
before
the
search.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
no
arrest
before
the
search.
there
was
also
no
consent
for
the
search.
in
any
event
during
the
motion
suppressed
hearing,
both
petitioners
agreed
that
they
did
not
own
the
car
in
question.
the
car
was
owned
by
one
of
the
female
companions
who
happen
to
be
the
former
wife
of
petitioner
king.
the
trial
court
decided
that
since
neither
the
petitioner
own
the
car
that
they
did
not
have
standing
to
contest
the
search
and
their
motion
suppressed
then
was
summarily
disposed
off
on
that
grounds.
the
trial
court
nor
the
appellate
court
discussed
the
legitimately
on
a
premises
rule
which
we
rely
upon
here.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that's
exactly
correct
and
i
believe
the
issue
in
this
case
contrary
to
what
the
respondents
brief
would
suggest
is
whether
this
rule
does
apply
to
automobiles.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
acknowledge
that
your
honor.
however,
the
major
distinction
which
has
been
made
between
automobiles
and
homes
is
the
mobility
of
an
automobile.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
it's
generally
been
held
that
the
police
have
a
greater
right
to
conduct
warrantless
searches
to
automobile.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
recent
cases
have
dwelled
upon
the
point
that
there
is
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy
in
an
automobile.
however,
there
is
ample
authority
also
for
the
proposition
that
not
withstanding,
there
is
a
substantial
right
of
privacy
in
an
automobile.
now,
i
think
maybe
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
don't
think
so
unless
you
can
say
that
there
is
absolutely
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
automobile.
and
because
obviously,
we
know
the
owner
would
have
standing
to
conduct
the
search.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
of
course,
it
is
diminished.
but
as
i
was
saying,
the
owner
of
the
automobile
still
has
standing.
now
of
course,
the
owner
of
a
house
would
have
standing.
we
to
say
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
guest
but
not
the
owners.
there
is
a
differential
between
owners
and
guests
same
in
both
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
no,
i
don't
believe
so
because
as
long
as
the
right
of
privacy
exists
and
someone
can
be
the
victim
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
be
it
an
automobile
or
a
house,
you
should
have
standing
to
raise
that
issue.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
oh,
absolutely
not.
i
think
that
would
be
a
perhaps
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
the
victim
is
one
who
actually
suffers
an
invasion
of
the
privacy
which
he
had
and
his
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
i
believe
that
a
passenger
in
automobile
does
have
that
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
not
under
the
legitimately
on
a
premises
rule
which
i
have
advanced.
you
have
to
be
present
under
jones
versus
united
states
to
have
that
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
to
have
that
necessary
interest
in
the
premises
search.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
would
have
to
concede
that
if
you're
not
present,
you
were
not
be
a
victim
on
the
search,
but
if
you
are
present
you
have
the
expectation.
you
have
an
interest
in
the
premises
search
and
i
see
no
reason
to
differentiate
between
automobiles
and
houses.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
think
it
was
invaded
when
the
car
stopped.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
believe
it
was
invaded
to
several
points,
including
when
the
car
was
stopped
and
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
when
the
car
was
stopped
your
honor.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
when
the
car
was
searched.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that's
correct,
that
would
be
another
time
and
i
think
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
quite
broad
enough
to
allow
a
search
of
a
car
without
probable
cause.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that's
exactly
true.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
no,
it's
not.
i
believe
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
has
presented
an
argument
which
simply
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
the
first
case
we
rely
on
here
is
jones
versus
united
states
which
presented
two
tests
or
grounds
for
standing;
one
is
the
automatic
standing
rule
which
we
limited
to
possess
retype
offenses
which
says
was
not,
and
the
second
alternative
holding
is
the
legitimately
on
the
premises
rule
which
we
rely
on.
that
in
mancusi
versus
deforte
was
stated
to
have
general
application.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that
is
true,
but
i
think
it's
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that
is
correct.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
for
the
purposes
of
argument,
i
would
say
eliminated
offer,
i
think
since
i
haven't
briefed
that
point
whether
that
actually
eliminated,
i
won't.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that
was
a
dilemma
which
was
faced
with
the
automatic
standing
which
i
do
not
rely
upon
here.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
might
add
that
mr.
justice
harlan
also
wrote
the
mancusi
versus
deforte
opinion
in
which
did
not
involve
the
posssessory
offense,
and
in
his
opinion
he
clearly
notes
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
two
tests.
it
would
appear
to
me
that
the
standing
is
based
upon
what
the
fourth
amendment
protects
which
is
the
right
of
privacy
not
necessarily
property.
therefore,
if
one
has
that
expectation
of
privacy
he
would
have
standing.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
well
certainly
if
there
is
a
violation
of
fourth
amendment,
one
would
have
to
have
standing.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
well,
i
agree
with
that
though
if
one
is
the
victim
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
he
should
have
standing.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
oh
no
because
if
you
aren't
a
victim
of
the
illegal
police
conducts,
if
it
was
somebody
else
who
was
a
victim,
you
would
not
have
standing
or
i
would
not
have
standing.
but
if
you
are
the
actual
victim,
then
you
should
have
standing.
my
contention
here
is
that
my
clients
were
the
actual
victims
of
the
police
action.
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
they
were
the
victims,
therefore
they
have
standing.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
victim
is
one
who
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
at
the
time
of
the
contested
police
conduct.
in
this
particular
case,
they
had
that
expectation
because
they
were
legitimately
present
in
the
car.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
would
hate
to
make
that
argument.
however,
it
has
been
made
successfully
in
a
few
courts.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
were
that
close,
they
might
have
standing.
i
think
there
is
a
case
that
i'm
aware
of
where
one
did
leave
the
car
momentarily
and
was
held
not
to
have
standing.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
no
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that's
a
difficult
question
and
it
doesn't
apply
here.
my
feeling
is
if
you've
never
been
on
the
premises,
perhaps
not.
but
that's
not
the
case
we
have
here.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
think
that
makes
good
sense
justice
stevens.
now,
we
also
have
another
issue
in
this
case
which
concerns
what
is
known
as
directed
at
theory.
under
this
theory,
one
who
has
the
search
intentionally
directed
at
him
would
have
standing.
the
theoretical
basis
for
the
theory
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
unlawful
police
conduct
and
the
best
deterrents
would
be
giving
standing
to
one
to
whom
the
search
was
personally
directed
at.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that
would
be
better
deterrent.
however,
i
think
that
the
case
law
would
suggest
that
some
sort
of
limitation
is
an
order.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
perhaps
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
thank
your
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
very
frankly,
i
find
this
case
remarkably
simple.
it
seems
to
me
that
all
we're
talking
about
is
that
property
concepts
no
longer
apply
to
standing.
therefore,
the
legitimately
on
the
premise
rule
is
even
more
valid
today
that
perhaps
it
was
before.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that's
right
your
honor,
and
i'm
willing
to
concede
that
there
is
a
diminished
expectation
of
privacy
in
automobile.
however,
i
think
it's
abundantly
clear
both
logically
and
in
this
court's
opinion
that
the
interior
of
an
automobile
is
indeed
a
protected
area.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
well,
i
think
we
should
make
a
distinction
between
what
would
be
a
legal
seizure
or
search
because
of
course
you
have
the
plain
view
doctrine
would
allow
--
would
make
the
police
officers
conduct
legal,
but
perhaps
we
should
still
grant
standing
of
the
person
who's
present
in
the
automobile
to
contest
whether
or
not
that
gun
was
in
fact
in
plain
view.
one
other
comment
also
--
well,
we
make
an
example
at
this
point.
a
number
of
examples
were
suggested
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
think
that
hitchhiker
would
probably
--
would
have
standing,
however
we're
not
hitchhikers
in
this
case,
we're
clearly
not
hitchhikers
and
also
i
wonder
if
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
legitimately
on
the
premises
rule
would
apply
to
hitchhikers.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
it
would
not
apply
to
someone
who
is
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
it
would
not
apply
to
it
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
not
legitimately
on
the
premise
is
with
my
answer.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
hitchhiker
would
be
legitimately
on
the
premises.
however,
i
wonder
--
i
wonder
if
maybe
that
is
really
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
think
that
is
true,
but
i
wonder
if
that
is
really
a
serious
problem.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
well,
if
you're
thinking
can
that
situation
come
up
very
often
because
you
would
assume
that
this
person
that
we're
talking
about
is
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
yes,
but
can
they
be
incriminated
by
something
found
in
that
car
unless
they
have
some
association
with
the
car.
so
maybe,
you're
talking
about
a
very
isolated
circumstance.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
no.
so
far
as
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
so
far
as
raising
this
issue
is
concerned,
of
course
there
are
many
hitchhikers
but
i
think
it
would
be
rare
that
a
hitchhiker
would
be
incriminated
by
something
found
in
the
car,
and
i
also
would
hasten
to
add
that
they
were
not
hitchhikers
in
this
case.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
legitimately
on
the
premises?
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
it
would
certainly
be
helpful
and
i
would
not
wish
to
discard
it,
but
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
well,
if
we
conceive,
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy.
you'd
have
to
go
to
direct
that
theory.
might
i
add
on
that
point
also
that
in
the
dissent
by
mr.
justice
black
in
the
mancusi
case,
he
suggested
that
perhaps
it
would
be
proper
to
combine
legitimately
on
the
premises
and
directed
that.
if
that
would
be
a
test,
i
think
it
would
be
an
extension
of
what
the
present
test
is,
but
if
that's
a
test,
we
still
meet
that
in
this
case.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
it
was
an
office.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
not
as
far
as
standing
is
concern
because
that's
what
we
would
like
to
contest.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
it's
a
probable
cause
to
stop
the
vehicle?
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
would
think
so
because
he
first
to
have
standing
to
challenge
has
being
patted
down,
that's
his
person,
and
i
think
he
also
has
standing
to
contest
to
stop.
that's
not
saying
that
there's
probable
cause,
you
will
lose
or
he
may
lose.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
well
then
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
he's
conceited
the
issue,
it's
not
a
standing
question
it's
not
just
an
issue.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
that
is
true.
i
was
just
thinking
what
it
would
happen
in
the
case
of
a
husband
and
wife.
one
of
whom
is
the
registered
owner
of
the
car,
we
going
to
say
that
both
would
not
have
standing?
or
that
to
me
seems
suggest
rather
absurd
result.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
have
nothing
further
if
there's
no
further
question.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
i
don't
think
the
driver
of
a
stolen
car
has
standing.
mr.
g.
joseph
weller
i
would
hate
to
argue
that
issue
and
i
don't
think
that
would
be
the
case.
it's
legitimately
on
the
premises
again
