justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
standing
is
a
prudential
rule,
doesn't
it
make
some
sense
to
say
that
if
automobiles
are
subject
to
less
rigorous
substantive
requirements
as
to
search
and
seizures,
they're
also
subject
to
stricter
standing
requirement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
could
use
both
to
zero,
i
mean
you
never
get
an
automobile
case,
but
if
you're
for
simply
talking
about
diminished
expectations
of
privacy
as
compared
to
a
house,
then
wouldn't
it
make
sense
to
say
there
are
stricter
rules
of
standing
too
because
we
don't
consider
the
interest
in
privacy
as
great
in
an
automobile
as
we
do
in
a
house?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
as
the
chief
justice
has
commented,
we
have
differentiated
between
houses
and
automobiles
for
purposes
of
substantive
fourth
amendment
inquiries;
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
differentiate
between
them
for
standing
purposes
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
arguing
an
injury
in
fact
that
if
it
your
trial
evidence
is
introduced
against
you
which
has
been
obtained
in
violation
of
fourth
amendment,
you
can
object
to
it
eventhough
you
didn't
own
it?
it
wasn't
on
and
but
you
weren't
on
the
premises
when
it
was
taken?
are
you
arguing
of
simply
do
away
withstanding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
what
is
it
mean
to
say
you're
the
victim
of
an
unlawful
search?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
how
about
supposing
that
the
police
go
to
a's
house
and
searched
without
a
warrant
and
find
a
letter
that
has
your
finger
prints
on
it
and
you
were
not
in
the
house
at
the
time
the
search
occurred
and
the
letter
did
not
belong
to
you,
nonetheless,
it
tends
to
incriminate
you.
do
you
think
you
should
have
standing
to
object
to
the
introduction
of
that
at
your
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
haven't
been
a
victim
of
the
search
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
have
an
expectation
of
privacy,
your
fourth
amendment
interests
are
implicated
are
they
not?
i
mean,
isn't
that
almost
saying
that
there
is
no
standing
rule
separate
from
a
substantive
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
what's
the
point
of
a
standing
rule?
the
standing
rule
assumes
that
some
people
may
have
a
fourth
amendment
claim
that
they
could
make
if
they
only
had
standing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
you
are
arguing
first
injury
in
fact
or
doing
away
with
standing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
again
do
you
define
the
term
victim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
they
were
ten
feet
away
from
the
car?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose
he
never
been
in
the
car
but
he
was
just
ten
feet
away
from
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
he
be
"legitimately
on
the
premises"
as
you
to
use
the
term
under
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
it
even
better
deterrent
be
to
simply
to
do
away
with
standing
and
say
that
anyone
who
has
evidence
offered
against
him
at
his
trial,
it
was
seized
in
violation
of
fourth
amendment
ought
to
be
able
to
object
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
consistent
with
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
that
the
legitimately
on
the
premises
are
rule
for
houses
carries
over
automatically
to
automobiles?
i
thought
you
said
that
you
thought
it
did.
only
did
once.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
to
go
to
direct
that
add
forget
about
jones
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
mancusi
was
a
building,
not
a
car?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case
after
receiving
a
report
of
a
robbery
of
a
closing
store
in
bourbonnais,
illinois.
the
police
stopped
a
suspect
a
getaway
car
in
which
petitioners
were
passengers.
the
police
searched
the
car
and
found
a
box
of
riffle
shells
in
the
glove
compartment
which
was
locked
and
a
sawed-off
riffle
under
the
front
passenger
seat.
neither
the
petitioner
is
the
owner
of
the
automobile
and
neither
has
ever
asserted
that
he
own
the
riffle
or
shells
seized.
before
trial,
petitioners
moved
to
suppress
the
riffle
and
shells
on
the
ground
that
the
search
violated
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment,
but
the
trial
court
ruled
that
petitioners
lacked
standing
to
object
of
the
search.
the
illinois
appellate
court
upheld
that
ruling
and
we
granted
certiorari.
in
jones
against
the
united
states,
this
court
held
that
a
person
seeking
to
challenge
the
legality
of
a
search
is
a
basis
for
suppressing
evidence
must
show
that
he
was
the
victim
of
the
search
or
seizure.
today,
we
reject
petitionersâ€™
suggestion
that
we
broaden
the
rule
of
standing
enunciated
in
jones
so
that
any
criminal
defendant
at
whom
is
searched
was
directed
would
have
standing
to
contest
the
legality
of
that
search.
adoption
of
petitioners'
so-called
"target"
theory
wouldn't
affect
permitted
defendant
to
assert
that
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
a
third
party
entitled
him
to
have
evidence
suppressed
at
trial.
but
we
have
held
time
and
again
that
fourth
amendment
rights
are
personal
rights
which
may
not
be
asserted
by
vicariously
and
we
reaffirmed
that
holding
today.
having
rejected
petitioners'
"target"
theory
and
reaffirmed
the
principal
of
the
rights
assured
by
the
fourth
amendment
are
personal
rights
which
may
be
enforced
by
exclusion
of
evidence
only
at
the
instance
of
one's
whose
own
rights
were
infringed.
we
also
decide
that
the
concept
of
standing
discussed
in
the
jones
case
is
more
properly
subsumed
under
substantive
fourth
amendment
analysis.
the
question
of
whether
one's
fourth
amendment
rights
have
been
infringed
is
in
this
situation,
not
one
of
standing
it
all
but
of
what
rights
the
fourth
amendment
confers.
petitioners
here
seek
to
fit
their
situation
with
whom
the
language
of
jones
that
anyone
"legitimately
on
premises"
where
search
occurs
may
challenge
its
legality.
but
the
phrase
legitimately
on
the
premises
coined
in
jones
creates
too
broad
a
gauge
for
measurement
of
fourth
amendment
rights.
the
holding
in
jones
can
best
be
explained,
we
think,
in
the
light
of
our
later
decision
in
katz
versus
united
states.
by
the
fact
that
jones
had
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
premises
he
was
using
and
therefore
could
claim
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
judged
by
this
analysis,
we
find
that
petitioners'
claims
must
fail.
they
asserted
neither
a
property
nor
a
possessory
interest
in
the
automobile
nor
an
interest
in
the
property
seized
and
the
fact
that
they
were
legitimately
on
the
premises
in
the
sense
that
they
were
in
the
car
with
the
permission
of
the
owner
is
not
determinative
of
whether
they
had
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
particular
areas
of
the
automobile
search.
here
petitioner
simply
made
no
showing
that
they
had
any
such
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
glove
compartment
or
area
under
the
seat
of
the
car
in
which
they
were
merely
passengers.
since
the
search
did
not
violate
any
rights
of
these
petitioners,
we
affirmed
their
judgment
of
conviction.
mr.
justice
powell
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court

filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion

which

justice
