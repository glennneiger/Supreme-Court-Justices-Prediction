justice
potter
stewart
mr.
howe,
you
do
concede,
i
guess,
don't
you
that
the
practices
alleged
by
--
that
were
carried
on
by
the
realtors
in
this
case
known
colloquially
at
least
as
racial
steering
were
violative
of
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act?
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
submission
is
that
the
steeree
has
to
be
the
plaintiff
[voice
overlap]
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
mr.
howe
that
your
argument
was
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
by
mr.
justice
douglas
was
simply
summarizing
these
provisions
in
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
he
also
goes
on
to
talk
about
813,
which
gives
the
attorney
general
authority
to
bring
a
civil
action
in
any
appropriate
united
states
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
passage
is
on
page
12
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
rights
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
topic
case
on
which
you
so
heavily
relied
and
on
which
the
district
court
relied
in
this
case,
in
that
case
judge
kennedy's
opinion
says
that
the
court
holds
--
we
hold
that
the
language
of
section
3612
does
not
authorize
lawsuits
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
the
third
parties.
well,
and
that
characterizes
the
holding
of
the
court.
here,
the
plaintiffs
do
not
made
very
clear
that
they
are
not
trying
to
assert
the
right
of
third
parties
but
their
own
personal
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
asserted
an
injury
as
did
the
plaintiff
in
trafficante
to
themselves
resulting
from
these
practices
made
early
go
by
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
would
concede
at
least
that
their
allegations
are
not
those
of
somebody
asserting
their
rights
of
third
parties?
justice
potter
stewart
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
rights
that
they
assert
and
rights
that
are
simply
not
created
by
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
the
fact
is
that
the
trafficante
opinion
in
at
least
two
places
and
of
course
the
opinion
emphasizes
that
the
plaintiffs
were
occupants
of
a
precise
and
limited
apartment
complex,
does
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
one
of
those
references
would
seem
to
pretty
clearly
limit
the
standing
in
that
case
to
people
so
situated,
would
not
you
agree?
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
mr.
wallace
was
simply
this.
let
me
begin
by
expressing
my
understanding
with
which
may
i
ask
you,
if
you
agree
that
up
until
the
enactment
of
this
federal
legislation
so
far
as
federal
statutory
law
went,
forgetting
for
a
moment
1982,
there
was
nothing
wrong
about
racial
steering
so
far
as
federal
statutory
law
went.
therefore
any
rights
that
are
asserted
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
to
be
based
upon
this
statute,
limiting
again
forgetting
the
constitution
in
1982,
which
--
what
substantive
rights
are
these
plaintiffs
asserting,
created
by
3602
or
3
or
4
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
were
any
one
of
these
plaintiffs
been
rendered
unavailable
to
housing
as
a
result
of
the
actions
of
these
defendants?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
a
result
of
steering.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that
is
the
hope
for
result
of
steering.
justice
potter
stewart
just
let
me
be
sure
i
fully
understand
you
that
the
plaintiffsâ€™
entire
substantive
claim,
substantive
statutory
claim,
forgetting
again
about
1982,
is
based
upon
the
second
half
of
3604
(a),
forgetting
or
otherwise
make
available,
make
unavailable,
excuse
me,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
the
injury
as
to
these
plaintiffs.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
am
asking
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
surely,
i
think
that
is
been
conceded
by
your
brother.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
does
that
go
mr.
wallace,
according
to
the
chief
justice's
question?
justice
potter
stewart
any
residents
of
illinois
can
sue
and
say,
i
am
uncomfortable
living
in
a
state
where
there
are
any
communities;
they
are
not
fully
disaggregated?
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
is
community
in
a
broader
sense?
justice
potter
stewart
so
is
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
just
made
the
point
that
trafficante
must,
its
logic
must
take
us
way
beyond
a
single
apartment
complex,
now
how
far
beyond?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
as
a
resident
of
illinois,
i
do
not
like
having
any
non-disaggregated
community
in
the
entire
state
in
which
i
live.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
am
hurt
by
it.
i
say
i
am
hurt?
justice
potter
stewart
economically
affected
or
how?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
necessarily
economically,
he
does
not
have
to
show
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
twice
the
value
of
cost
of
the
market
price
of
his
house
is
going
down?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
relied
on
private
attorneys
general?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
just
wondered
how
many
private
attorneys
general
there
are?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
red
line
to
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would
almost
go
to
the
merits?
