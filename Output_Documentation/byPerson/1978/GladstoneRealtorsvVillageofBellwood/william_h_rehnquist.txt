justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
howe,
was
there
a
cross-petition
for
certiorari
from
that
portion
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
agree,
would
not
you
mr.
caruso
that
you
have
to
go
beyond
the
holding
in
trafficante
in
order
to
sustain
your
position
because
of
the
fact
that
appear,
the
plaintiffs
in
trafficante
were
tenants
or
occupants
of
the
apartment
complex
in
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
the
government's
brief
on
page
6,
in
it
is
introduction
and
summary
of
the
argument
says,
“we
submit
that
the
individual
respondents
have
standing
to
challenge
petitioners’
racial
steering
practices
under
the
fair
housing
act.”
now,
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
it
held
that
both
the
city
and
the
individual
respondents
had
standing.
does
the
government
take
a
position
on
the
standing
of
the
city?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
to
get
back
to
3604,
which
is
apparently
the
‘a’,
which
you
say
as
the
source
of
the
substantive
right.
it
reads,
to
refuse
to
sell
or
rent
after
the
making
of
a
bona
fide
offer
or
to
refuse
to
negotiate
for
the
sale
or
rent
however
otherwise
make
unavailable.
you
do
not
read
the
subsequent
clauses
after
refused
to
sell
or
rent,
after
the
making
of
a
bona
fide
offer,
as
for
having
required
a
bona
fide
offer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
an
individual
seller
who
refuse
to
negotiate
for
the
sale
or
rental
of
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
spite
of
congress's
concern
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
not
to
negotiate
it?
