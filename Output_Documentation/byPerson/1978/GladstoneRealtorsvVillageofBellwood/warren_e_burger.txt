we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
gladstone,
realtors
against
village
of
bellwood.
mr.
howe,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

mr.
howe,
having
in
mind
that
there
appears
to
be
a
considerable
ambiguity
question
about
it,
how
much
in
the
scales
should
there
be
weighed
the
ultimate
objectives
of
the
legislation
as
a
whole?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
trafficante
helps
you
very
much
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
howe.
mr.
caruso?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
test
out
how
far
you
would
carry
this,
suppose
someone
living
in
the
springfield
or
peoria
came
in
and
said
--
in
a
complaint
alleged
that
they
did
not
like
the
country
life,
they
had
wherever
was
they
were
living
and
they
wanted
to
move
into
a
totally
integrated
community
and
they
were
thinking
about
coming
into
this
particular
complex,
but
the
situation
that
has
been
described
in
the
pleading
is
existed
and
therefore
they
bring
a
suit
under
3612
in
federal
court
immediately.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
am
just
trying
to
see
how
long
the
arm
is,
how
you
would
carry
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
assuming
you
consume
that
my
hypothetical,
that
is
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
they
need
to
live
in
the
same
community
to
get
relief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
caruso.
mr.
wallace,
of
course,
as
usual,
there
is
no
obligation
on
you
to
consume
all
that
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
wallace.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
howe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
