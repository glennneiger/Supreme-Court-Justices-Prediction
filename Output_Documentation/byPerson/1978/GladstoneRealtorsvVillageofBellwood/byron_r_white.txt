justice
byron
r.
white
was
not
that
trafficante
suit
under
both
sections?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
certainly
did
not
put
section
812
aside,
did
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
that
if
you
are
right,
trafficante
was
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
insofar
as
the
silence
of
congress
is
concerned
about
indirect
victims,
it
is
no
more
meaningful
here
than
it
was
in
trafficante?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
think
that,
you
do
not
think
that
the
trafficante
indicated
that
the
people
who
had
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies
could
then
sue
under
812?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
he
gets
there,
what
section
is
he
under?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
where
the
cause
of
action
is
given?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
does
not
give
them
a
cause
of
action
in
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
i
suppose
the
trafficante
says
moreover
these
rights
may
be
enforced
by
civil
actions
in
appropriate
united
states
district
courts
without
regarding
the
amount
of
controversy
of
brought
within
180
days
after
the
alleged
discriminatory
housing
practice
has
occurred.
these
rights
referring
to
the
810
rights,
after
citing
810
(d)
and
then
the
court
cites
section
812
(a),
that
is
in
page
209,
409
u.
s.
209.
perhaps
the
court
was
just
wrong
there,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
suppose
if
the
court
was
right,
it
was
saying
that
these
very
rights
that
were
rejected
in
the
administrative
process
could
be
brought
in
the
court
under
812
and
that
would
include
indirect
purchases?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
arguing
that
this
reference
of
812
then
is
just
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
the
reference
is
correct
because
it
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
correct,
it
is
merely
a
summarization.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
correct.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
refers
to
these
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
having
just
left
section
d,
810(d).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
never
mind,
i
was
just
wondered
what
your
position
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
trafficante
has
limits,
which
it
certainly
does
and
even
if
this
exceeds
those
limits,
that
is
a
long
ways
from
taking
the
position
that
only
direct
purchasers
have
a
cause
of
action
under
3612.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
understand
the
challenge
here
to
be
a
case
of
controversy
challenge?
justice
byron
r.
white
solely
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
statutory
question
in
the
sense
that
even
if
there
is
a
case
of
controversy,
congress
did
not
intend
this
particular
kind,
this
class
of
person
do
have
the
right
to
get
in
the
court,
even
he
could
get
in
the
court
under
810.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
there
would
be
no
difference
between
that
person
under
812
or
810
as
far
as
case
of
controversy
is
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
cheap.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
like
you
were
preparing
like
a
witness
yesterday?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
left
open
a
1982
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
did
not
mention
812?
