mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
i
want
to
emphasize
about
this
case
is
that
contrary
to
some
impressions
that
some
may
have
of
it;
it
is
not
in
our
view
a
case
about
whether
testers
have
standing
to
sue
under
section
812.
testers
do
provide
important
evidence,
particularly
in
racial
steering
cases,
it
is
very
difficult
to
prove
racial
steering
in
our
experience
in
the
absence
of
evidence
of
this
kind
and
occasionally
you
can
evidence
from
a
former
employee
of
the
company,
but
by
and
large
this
has
been
the
most
prohibitive
kind
of
evidence
in
steering
cases,
but
it
is
just
coincidental
that
the
complainants
in
this
case
also
happen
to
be
the
witnesses,
the
potential
witnesses
who
have
been
doing
the
testers.
their
interest
here
is
an
interest
in
the
way
their
community
has
been
affected
by
the
cumulative
effects
of
the
steering
practices,
and
its
cumulative
effects
that
the
steering
practices
have
their
pugnacious
effects
on
the
community.
insofar
as
the
statute
deals
with
steering,
its
focus
is
not
really
as
an
anti-fraud
provision
about
a
particular
individual.
very
often
the
individual
who
has
been
steered,
who
is
a
willing
purchaser
of
a
home
or
a
renter
is
quite
satisfied
with
the
property
that
he
is
settled
into.
it
is
the
cumulative
effect
that
causes
the
injury
to
the
community
and
the
people
living
in
the
community.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
not
taken
a
position
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
we
have
no
disagreement
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
subject
and
indeed
hud
has
entertained
complaints
from
municipal
corporations
similarly
situated
and
initiated
investigations
in
response
to
such
complaints.
so
while
we
didn't
brief
the
question
because
we
thought
that
the
case
was
pretty
clearly
controlled
by
trafficante
with
respect
to
the
individual
complainants,
we
have
no
disagreement
with
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
indeed
with
any
aspect
of
judge
powell’s
opinion,
we
think
it
is
a
fine
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
3604
or
what
we
call
section
804
of
title
viii,
3604
(a).
it's
set
forth
quite
completely
in
the
briefs
for
the
petitioners
and
our
theory
right
along
and
we
have
brought
about
80
cases
of
our
own
in
the
course
of
the
act
alleging
racial
steering
of
one
kind
or
another,
has
been
that
it
is
a
violation
of
that
portion
of
3604
(a),
which
refers
to
or
otherwise
make
unavailable
or
deny
a
dwelling
to
any
person.
the
first
part
of
3604
(a),
which
includes
the
qualification
of
the
bona
fide
offer
focuses
on
a
violation
by
the
seller
himself
or
the
renter
himself
and
they
wanted
to
afford
the
protection
to
make
sure
there
was
a
bona
fide
offer
made
to
that
individual
in
many
instances
rather
than
a
company
engaged
in
the
business,
before
there
would
be
a
violation
of
that
kind,
but
the
remainder
obviously
has
principal
reference
to
people
engaged
in
the
real
estate
business
or
to
big
renters
of
property.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no
there
--
as
i
look
at,
as
we
look
at
the
right
that
they
are
asserting
under
the
statute,
it
is
not
a
right
as
counsel
for
the
petitioners
as
expressed
to
live
in
an
integrated
society,
congress
could
not
guarantee
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
and
did
not
purport
to
guarantee
that,
but
it
is
a
right
not
to
be
injured
by
the
effects
of
practices
that
are
proscribed
under
the
statute
and
it
is
a
right
not
to
be
affected
by
the
racial
steering
that
the
statute
prohibits.
it
is
very
similar
to
the
right
asserted
by
the
plaintiffs
in
the
trafficante
case.
there
was
as
the
court
noted
in
its
opinion
in
trafficante,
considerable
focus
in
the
legislative
history
on
the
dangers
to
the
community
of
discriminatory
practices
in
housing
and
the
benefits
to
all
members
of
the
community
with
adherence
to
the
requirements
that
were
being
proposed
in
the
fair
housing
act.
and
one
of
the
telling
things
about
steering
case
is
and
we
reviewed
every
decided
case
yesterday
rather
hastily,
every
decided
case
under
title
viii,
one
of
the
telling
things
is
that
we
did
not
find
a
single
instance
of
a
case
in
which
an
individual
had
sued
solely
because
he
had
been
steered
and
claimed
an
injury
as
a
result
of
that.
there
were
a
few
cases
in
which
an
individual
claimed
that
he
was
illegally
denied
access
to
a
particular
house
that
he
wanted
to
buy
or
a
particular
apartment
that
he
wanted
to
go
into
and
was
seeking
that
and
additionally
alleged
that
there
was
steering
done.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
could
be
a
result
of
steering.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
often
the
result
is
that
he
was
shown
something
else
and
he
liked
it
and
he
moved
in
and
he
never
knew
about
the
other
and
he
wasn't
trying
to
get
into
the
other.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
red
lining
is
usually
used
in
reference
to
credit
practices
by
lending
institutions,
and
areas
–-
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yeah,
that
is
right,
areas
where
it
is
harder
to
get
a
mortgage
fund,
even
though
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
here
there
were
areas
where
steering
of
customers
by
the
real
estate
companies
was
done
on
the
basis
of
race.
but
what
we
have
found
is
that
the
cases
where
private
suits
have
been
brought
alleging
steering
and
attempting
to
enjoying
the
steering
or
claiming
damages
from
steering
have
typically
been
cases
by
community
fair
housing
organizations
where
the
plaintiffs
would
be
a
number
of
individuals
who
have
banded
together
because
of
the
effect
the
steering
has
had
on
their
community.
and
it
may
well
be
that
some
of
these
plaintiffs
have
actually
dealt
with
these
companies
and
being
steered
themselves,
which
you
do
not
ordinarily
see
that
alleged
in
the
complaint
because
it
is
very
difficult
for
them
to
prove
what
was
available
that
they
were
not
shown
in
the
absence
of
the
testing
evidence,
which
is
something
gathered
separately.
and
in
other
words,
if
you
have
someone
who
was
himself
a
victim
of
steering
as
a
plaintiff
from
one
of
these
cases,
it
is
more
or
less
coincidental
and
it
is
his
similarity
to
other
plaintiffs
that
we
have
in
this
case
that
is
his
real
motivation
for
being
a
plaintiff
rather
than
the
difference,
which
he
does
not
even
allege
typically.
so
that
tells
us
something
about
what
it
is
as
the
incentive
to
sue
here
and
that
has
something
to
do
with
realistically
where
the
standing
should
be
recognized.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that
is
our
theory
that
we
have
operated
on
about
where
steering
as
proscribed
in
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
there
are
other
provisions
there
that
some
have
looked
toward
in
the
literature
as
bearing
on
the
steering
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
we
have
relied
on
3604(a)
and
no
court
has
ever
expressed
doubt
that
steering
is
prohibited
by
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
that
has
been
conceded
for
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so,
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
typical
kind
of
private
complainant
about
racial
steering
and
the
injury
that
is
typically
alleged
in
a
racial
steering
case.
and
i
think
that
is
of
some
importance
in
concomitance
with
the
concerns
that
were
being
expressed
in
congress
about
the
community
interest
that
would
be
served
by
this
legislation.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
mr.
justice
white
was
suggesting
early
in
the
argument,
there
were
claims
made
under
section
812
in
trafficante,
which
is
the
section
that
the
suit
has
been
brought
under
here
and
indeed
there
were
complainants
in
trafficante,
complainants
in
intervention
who
had
not
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies
with
hud,
who
would
not
complain
to
hud
at
all
and
the
sole
basis
for
their
suit
in
intervention
was
section
812.
and
there
is
significance
in
our
view
to
the
statement
that
he
quoted
from
page
409
of
the
opinion
that
individuals
could
sue
directly
under
section
812
because
those
were
among
the
complainants
who
were
seeking
not
only
injunctive
relief,
but
they
also
made
damage
claims
and
on
remand,
the
case
was
settled.
but
the
district
court
and
everyone
else
thought
that
their
claims
had
been
upheld
along
with
the
claims
of
the
two
tenants
who
had
first
gone
to
hud
and
were
suing
under
section
810.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
has
been
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
not
think
it
solely.
i
think
there
is
an
argument
being
made
under
article
iii
in
the
petitioners’
brief.
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
challenge
is
largely
foreclosed
by
the
decision
in
trafficante
and
that
there
is
an
open
question
here,
it
is
a
statutory
question.
these
people
are
directly
effected
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
complainants
in
trafficante.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
has
been
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
in
my
view
is
the
principle
question
in
the
case.
i
agree
with
that
formulation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all,
not
at
all
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
motivation
behind
putting
in
the
bona
fide
offer
requirement
as
it
is
recounted
in
petitioners’
brief
focused
on
the
liability
of
the
particular
seller
or
renter
and
there
was
resistance
to
making
him
liable
in
the
absence
of
a
bona
fide
offer
and
the
language
was
carefully
placed
in
the
statute.
there
was
no
concern
about
the
practices
of
real
estate
companies
that
would
not
even
tell
people
about
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
i
think
would
be
liable
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
were
concerned
that
someone
should
not
be
claimed
to
have
refused
to
sell
to
someone
because
of
his
race,
if
that
person
was
not
a
good
faith
purchaser
who
made
a
bona
fide
offer,
but
if
the
seller
was
going
to
refuse
to
even
show
the
property
or
talk
to
anyone,
the
concern
did
not
carry
over.
of
course,
it
is
not
a
question
in
this
case.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
statutory
language
that
the
bona
fide
offer
qualification
relates
only
to
refusal
to
rent
or
sell,
if
that
is
the
claim.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
right.
i
think
if
you
refuse
to
even
talk
to
someone
about
what
is
available,
it
is
a
violation
of
the
statute
as
we
view
it,
but
that
is
not
ordinarily
the
form
the
violations
take.
it
is
really
unreasonable
to
expect
a
bona
fide
offer
to
be
made
for
a
house
that
is
not
even
shown
to
someone,
and
that
applies
to
both
the
steering
and
the
refusal
to
negotiate.
i
think
it
is
the
sensible
way
to
read
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
understanding
of
the
statute
and
indeed
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
except
for
the
united
states.
we
never
can–
really,
we
have
a
separate
provision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
great
advantages
and
they
are
the
ones
that
congress
actually
anticipated
in
providing
this
as
an
alternative
remedy
and
that
is
that
many
matters
are
informally
settled
without
the
expensive
litigation
through
the
good
offices
of
hud,
through
the
conciliation
process.
hud
is
now
getting
about
3800
complaints
per
year,
a
far
greater
number
than
are
submitted
to
the
courts.
and
many
of
them
are
quite
expeditiously
finally
resolved,
not
always
in
favor
of
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
cheap,
that
is
right.
it
is
inexpensive
and
they
did
a
computer
run
down
for
us
this
week
of
their
disposition
as
between
october
of
1976
and
may
of
1978,
and
more
than
half
of
the
complaints
were
finally
disposed
of
within
120
days.
during
that
period,
there
were
11.2%
were
finally
disposed
of
within
30
days,
and
another
17.2%
in
30-60
days,
another
16.2%
in
60-90
days,
and
so
on,
13.8%
in
91-120
days,
so
many
of
the
complaints
can
expeditiously
be
disposed
of.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
it
has
been
hud's
consistent
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
the
alternative
remedies
are
available
for
any
person
aggrieved
within
the
meaning
of
810,
and
at
every
step
in
the
process,
their
notifications
to
individuals
who
have
complained
to
them
include
a
statement
that
they
have
a
right
to
sue
under
section
812.
and
indeed,
there
is
much
in
the
legislation
evolution
of
the
two
provisions,
which
suggests
that
this
is
right.
all
of
the
resistance
to
the
fair
housing
legislation
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
resistance.
one
of
the
main
focal
points
was
on
the
idea
of
the
federal
bureaucrats
becoming
involved
and
indeed
the
deferral,
the
main
motivation
behind
the
deferral
that
was
required
to
local
fair
housing
officials
was
that
the
federal
bureaucracy
should
not
be
interfering
in
areas
where
local
conciliation
and
mediation
efforts
are
available,
which
suggests
that
quite
the
opposite
of
what
is
being
argued
today
that
the
deferral
should
take
place
in
the
absence
of
hud’s
involvement,
rather
than
as
the
statute
focuses
it
in
the
presence
of
hud's
involvement,
it
is
hud
itself
that
is
supposed
to
defer
of
these
processes.
and
in
looking
again
at
the
legislative
history,
the
immediate
evolution
of
812
is
connected
with
this
and
it
was
recounted
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
in
the
trafficante
case,
which
i
reread
yesterday.
and
i
regret
to
say
some
of
the
pertinent
portions
of
the
legislative
history
were
not
reproduced
in
any
of
the
briefs
in
the
present
case,
but
they
can
be
found
in
our
brief
in
the
trafficante
case.
and
i
would
like
to
just
mention
rather
briefly
some
of
those
pertinent
aspects
of
it,
in
addition
to
the
ones
that
we
have
cited
in
our
present
brief.
and
i
have
for
the
convenience
of
those
members
of
the
court
who
would
like
to
have
it,
i
have
submitted
to
the
clerk
ten
copies
xeroxed
of
the
pertinent
pages
of
the
brief
that
we
filed
in
trafficante
and
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
[attempt
to
laughter]
well,
we
did
recount
there
in
some
rather
lengthy
textual
footnotes,
the
immediate
derivation
of
section
812.
and
this
is
principally
in
footnote
8
of
that
brief
and
in
footnote
12
of
that
brief.
in
footnote
8,
we
pointed
out
that
section
810
itself
was
derived
from
section
11
of
a
bill
which
senator
mondale
had
offered
as
an
amendment
to
a
house
bill,
the
house
bill
that
came
over
at
this
time
in
1968,
this
is
after
two
years
of
previous
history
that
we
recounted
in
some
detail
in
our
present
brief.
the
bill
that
came
over
at
that
time
from
the
house
did
not
include
any
fair
housing
provisions
at
all.
and
senator
mondale
offered
as
an
amendment
a
bill
that
included
a
provision
similar
to
section
810,
but
it
also
included
authority
for
hud
issue
cease
and
desist
orders
that
would
be
enforceable
in
court.
and
it
was
the
cease
and
desist
authority,
something
similar
to
the
way
the
national
labor
relations
board
operates,
that
was
the
focal
point
of
controversy
and
that
resulted
in
the
failure
of
a
number
of
cloture
motions,
which
we
have
recounted
in
that
footnote
8.
and
at
that
point,
after
these
cloture
motions
had
failed,
senator
mondale
moved
to
table
his
proposed
amendment
and
supported
a
substitute
amendment
offered
by
senator
dirksen,
which
is
the
one
that
was
adopted
and
later
was
adopted
by
the
house.
and
this
retained
the
section
810
mechanism
for
making
an
administrative
complaint,
but
took
the
authority
to
issue
cease
and
desist
orders
away
from
hud
and
in
its
place
substituted
section
812
an
alternative
to
go
directly
into
state
or
federal
court.
and
as
we
argued
then
in
our
footnote
12
in
that
brief,
because
there
were
after
all
two
complainants
in
that
case,
who
were
complaining
only
under
section
812,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
failure
to
repeat
the
definition
of
person
aggrieved
in
section
812
made
any
change
in
the
class
of
complainants
who
were
authorized
to
pursue
either
of
the
remedies,
because
section
812
was
designed
as
a
substitute
for
the
cease
and
desist
remedy
that
had
originally
been
proposed
for
the
class
of
persons
aggrieved,
defined
in
what
had
been
section
11
of
senator
mondale's
bill.
there
was
nothing
in
this
immediate
evolution
of
the
alternative
remedy
that
suggests
any
notion
of
a
different
class
of
complainants.
it
was
a
way
to
ameliorate
the
objections
to
a
federal
administrative
remedy
for
the
class
of
complainants
that
both
proposals
were
designed
to
give
a
right
of
action
too.
and
so
the
additional
aspects
of
the
legislative
history,
which
we
have
recounted
in
our
present
brief
indicate
that
the
rational
hypothesis
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
it
was
entirely
hypothesis,
there
were
no
references
at
all
to
the
legislative
history
in
the
topic
opinion,
that
those
do
not
comport
at
all
with
the
actual
evolution
of
the
provisions
at
issue
or
the
congressional
intention,
which
was
as
has
been
the
practice
that
it
is
really
the
administrative
remedy
that
provides
the
inexpensive
quick
road
to
relief
in
many
instances
and
the
judicial
remedy
was
not
reserved
for
a
special
class
of
cases
that
had
to
be
more
expeditiously
handled.
our
experience
is
that
the
hope
for
expedition
in
section
812
and
section
813
cases
are
often
does
not
come
to
pass.
and
so,
we
really
think
that
this
case
is
in
every
pertinent
respect
no
different
from
trafficante.
it
is
true
that
you
have
a
wider
geographic
area
that
these
people
are
concerned
about.
they
do
not
happen
to
be
people
living
in
apartment
complex.
they
are
living
in
a
suburban
community,
but
they
too
are
protected
by
the
intent
of
congress
and
by
the
protections
of
the
act.
and
as
judge
stern,
i
think
very
eloquently
stated
in
a
case
in
new
jersey
that
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
fair
housing
council
against
eastern
bergen
county,
the
fact
that
the
alleged
injury
and
i
am
quoting
from
judge
stern
now,
affects
a
large
number
of
people
in
a
large
geographic
area
does
not
serve
to
attenuate
it.
on
the
contrary,
it
makes
the
harm
more
severe.
residents
of
an
all
white
housing
complex
may
need
only
to
look
to
the
next
residential
facility
for
the
inter-racial
associations
they
desire.
if
the
allegations
here
are
true,
residents
of
bergen
county
may
have
to
go
to
an
entirely
different
neighborhood
or
community.
similarly,
a
completely
white
building
is
less
of
a
ghetto
than
a
completely
white
neighborhood
or
a
community,
that
the
court
on
the
sanitaire
has
been
drawn
around
an
entire
community
rather
than
a
single
apartment
complex
does
not
render
it
unlawful.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
goes
to
people
who
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do
not
think
so,
we
think
they
have
to
show
a
more
direct
interest
that
their
own
community
is
affected
by
the
practices
that
they
are
complaining
us.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
--
the
best
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
best
answer
i
can
give
you
is
that,
that
is
not
the
kind
of
complaint
that
hud
has
received
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
probably
to
the
point
where
the
complainants
are
realistically
being
affected.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
isn't
their
feelings
being
hurt,
it
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
[attempt
to
laughter]
well,
the
question
is
whether
the
way
they
have
to
live
is
affected
by
unlawful
practices
of
someone
else
that
the
congress
has
proscribed
and
that
they
are
complaining
of,
not
whether
their
feelings
are
hurt
because
the
law
is
not
being
observed
by
everyone
in
the
country
or
in
their
state.
it
is
always
difficult
to
formulate
these
things
with
exactitude.
i
can
tell
you
that
hud
does
not
undertake
investigations
at
the
behest
of
people
who
do
not
in
someway
allege
that
they
are
affected.
for
example
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
they
do
not
require
a
pleading
the
way
a
court
might,
but
for
example,
if
they
got
a
complaint
from
a
former
employee
of
a
real
estate
company
that
the
company
was
engaging
in
steering
practices
and
that
employee
does
not
anyway
say
that
he
is
still
in
that
community
and
is
affected
by
those
practices.
hud
does
not
initiate
an
investigation,
instead
it
will
refer
that
complaint
to
the
department
of
justice
for
us
to
see
whether
there
is
a
violation
to
be
investigated.
the
same
thing
is
true
of
an
anonymous
complaint.
it
has
to
be
a
complaint
from
someone
who
shows
that
something
is
affecting
him,
his
life
and
his
community,
he
is
someway
affected
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
no.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
he
just
has
to
show
a
direct
interest
of
his
own.
and
we
do
what
we
can
to
enforce
the
statute.
the
court
in
trafficante
noted
that
the
housing
section
of
the
civil
rights
division
had
less
than
two
dozen
lawyers
at
that
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
hope
enough
to
enforce
the
statute.
we
now
have
only
21
attorneys
in
that
same
section.
and
it
has
the
additional
responsibility
of
enforcing
the
equal
credit
law
as
well
as
the
fair
housing
law.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
so
it
still
has
to
be
private
enforcement
that
is
the
primary
tool
to
bring
about
the
congressional
purpose
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
specified
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
specified
a
limited
area
to
which
black
customers
were
being
steered.
that
was
part
of
the
specificity
of
the
complaint,
but
i
do
not
think
the
complaint
specified
that
as
the
only
area
affected
by
the
steering.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
say
so
your
honor.
thank
you,
my
time
is
expired.
