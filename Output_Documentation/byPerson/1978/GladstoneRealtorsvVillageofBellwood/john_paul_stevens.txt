justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
section
of
the
act
do
you
concede
they
may
violate,
section
3604?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
asking
about
who
has
the
cause
of
action?
do
you
or
do
you
not
agree
that
if
the
allegations
are
true,
there
was
a
violation
of
3604?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
howe,
may
i
interrupt
you
once
again?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
concede
that
--
these
plaintiffs
still
allege
that
they
suffered
and
harm
themselves
and
you
concede
that
they
are
persons
aggrieved
within
the
meaning
of
section
3610?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
change
it,
you
argue
that
they
are
not
persons
aggrieved
within
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
but
they
are
not
--
but
you
do
concede,
don't
you
that
they
are
suing
for
an
injury
to
themselves
rather
than
the
third
parties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
[voice
overlap]
they
make
the
trafficante
allegation
that
they
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
live
in
an
integrated
community.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
submission
i
gather
is
in
the
alternative,
either
that's
not
enough
to
make
them
persons
aggrieved
because
there
is
a
little
difference
between
this
case
and
trafficante
or
alternatively
even
if
they
are
persons
aggrieved
3612,
somehow
or
other,
is
a
less
broad
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
it
does
not
have
that
language
in
it
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
also
does
not
have
any
limiting
language
in
it
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
the
court
of
appeal
say,
well,
there
are
alternative
remedies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mt.
howe
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
while
i
have
you
interrupted
again.
i
take
it,
there
is
no
definition
or
distinction
in
the
statute
that
is
termed
direct
victim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
a
definition
of
person
aggrieved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
say,
the
claimant
would
have
been
injured
by
the
housing
practice,
that
is
a
broader
concept
than
the
direct
victim
concept.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
your
argument,
but
maybe
i
am
just
repeating
what
mr.
justice
marshall
asked,
but
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history,
the
language
of
the
statute
that
you
can
point
to
that
says
there
is
this
distinction
between
direct
and
indirect
victims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
most
of
what
they
are
thinking
of
is
direct
victims
than
most
applications
of
sections
810
and
812
were
expected
to
be
alternative
remedy
application.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
well,
most
that
they
ever
thought
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
is
nothing
indicated
that
they
thought
about
this
narrow
category
of
indirect
victims
pursuant
to
one
section
and
not
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
howe,
there
is
one
another
difference
on
this
very
point
and
may
be
i
am
wrong
in
my
reading,
but
812
authorize
suits
in
state
courts
as
well
as
[voice
overlap]?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
810
only
authorizes
federal
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
does
that
cut,
i
do
not
--
is
there
any
inference
to
be
drawn
from
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
812
provides
for
a
stay
if
there
is
a
pending
administrative
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
true
that
there
are
8,200
people
in
the
trafficante
apartment
complex?
how
many
people
are
there
in
bellwood,
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
on
this
question
of
the
scope
of
trafficante,
you
know,
apparently
bellwood
had
some
20
or
25,000
people
and
that
if
we
have
to
compare
to
8,200
in
trafficante,
but
then
i
just
recall
that
the
complaints
actually
concern
a
limited
area
within
bellwood,
does
not
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
go
across
in
the
maywood,
i
am
not
sure
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
so
the
relevant
number
of
people
for
purposes
of
comparison
is
the
population
of
bellwood?
