mr.
f.
willis
caruso
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
we
would
like
to
cover
four
main
topics
in
our
discussion.
first
that
the
individuals
here,
the
individual
home
owners
are
very
much
individual
people
who
have
been
injured
and
are
being
injured
and
it
is
an
immediate
injury.
secondly
that
the
village
is
suing
to
protect
the
village
fisk
and
that
is
an
immediate
and
a
very
much
felt
injury
right
now.
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
these
two
sections
3610
and
3612
are
alternative
methods
of
enforcement,
and
finally
the
trafficante
is
very
applicable
to
this
situation
and
that
the
injury
here
indicates
an
even
more
stronger
situation
of
injury
to
individuals
in
taking
away
rights
guaranteed
under
3604.
the
homeowners
mr.
powell
and
the
others,
mr.
powell
happens
to
be
white,
found
that
there
was
steering
going
on
in
the
village
of
bellwood
and
that
the
impact
was
to
create
fear
and
problems
and
so
they
tried
to
do
something
about
it.
and
mr.
powell
wanted
to
live
in
bellwood
in
an
integrated
society,
in
integrated
schools,
in
a
normal
stable
kind
of
situation
and
he
wanted
to
do
something
about
it.
so
he
went
to
the
village
and
he
went
to
the
leadership
council,
a
fair
housing
group
in
chicago
to
work
on
this.
ms.
perry
is
black
and
she
lives
in
bellwood
and
she
wanted
to
continue
to
live
in
this
community,
which
was
a
normal
integrated
community
and
she
wanted
it
to
stay
that
way
where
her
children
could
live
and
deal
with
people
of
the
same
kind
of
living
situation
on
a
normal
basis
and
to
have
a
healthy
real
estate
market
free
from
fear
and
constant
pressure
by
the
real
estate
community.
at
the
same
time,
the
village
here
received
complaints
of
the
mayor's
office
and
the
police
department
of
real
estate
people
out
steering
in
the
neighborhoods
and
creating
fear
and
problems
among
the
people
in
the
community.
and
the
village
board
voted
to
ask
for
help
from
a
fair
housing
organization,
the
leadership
council.
some
of
the
plaintiffs
and
other
people
then
went
out
to
find
out
what
the
practices
were.
what
they
found
out
was
that
when
a
white
person
went
in
and
asked
for
a
certain
kind
of
housing
at
a
certain
value,
they
were
sent
to
certain
areas
considered
to
be
protected
and
set
aside
for
whites,
when
blacks
went
out
and
gave
the
same
kind
of
information,
we
want
a
$45,000
house
or
whatever
the
figure
was,
so
many
bedrooms
and
so
forth,
they
were
steered
mainly
to
two
particular
areas
where
they
were
trying
to
change
the
area
from
white
to
black.
the
village
after
seeing
this
information
from
the
audits,
both
from
the
people
who
are
plaintiffs
in
this
case
as
well
as
other
testers
or
auditors
or
investigators
or
whatever
they
may
be
called,
the
village
then
voted
to
take
action
in
the
federal
district
court
and
requested
again
assistance
in
filing
that
case
in
the
federal
district
court.
they
sought
direct
relief
under
3612
and
this
was
an
immediate
problem.
this
was
something
that
had
to
be
solved
quickly
and
it
is
something
that
had
to
be
done
and
get
into
court
right
away.
and
they
sought
that
3612
remedy
because
among
other
things
under
3614,
there
is
a
provision
that
these
cases
are
supposed
to
be
expedited,
and
in
many
cases
they
are.
defendants
here
acknowledged
that
there
is
a
violation
of
3604
(a)
and
that
they
think
that
a
plaintiff,
a
person
who
is
affected
by
violation
of
the
fair
housing
act
must
under
these
circumstances
go
through
the
route
of
going
to
hud
and
the
administrative
process
and
only
after
that
could
they
sue.
that
seems
to
indicate
that
they
see
and
in
fact
they
say,
they
see
a
system
here.
well
clearly,
if
the
congress
meant
to
have
that
kind
of
a
system,
they
could
have
followed
the
title
vii
approach
and
they
did
not
do
that.
congress
knew
how
to
make
that
exhaustion
necessary
and
they
did
not
do
it.
the
legislative
history
â€“-
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
well,
i
think
that
this
case
does
not
extend
anywhere
near
that
far,
anywhere
near
that
far.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
the
first
thing
is
that
in
the
complaint,
the
area
involved
is
specifically
delineated
by
streets,
a
very
specific
area
where
this
steering
activity
was
taking
place
is
delineated,
it
starts
from
there.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
and
the
people
involved
suing
here
are
the
village
itself
or
this
area
is
all
included
within
the
village
and
the
people
who
live
in
the
community,
although
one
of
whom
live
right
in
the
municipality,
miss.
sharp
lives
in
maywood,
which
is
on
a
budding
community,
subjected
to
the
same
kind
of
problems
and
in
the
same
marketplace.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
think
it
is
a
practical
matter
of
the
experiences
and
it
seems
that
the
experience
would
be
and
the
violation
of
future
would
be
people
living
either
in
that
community
or
very
close
by
because
they
are
affected
by
the
damage
that
we
allege,
the
manipulation
of
the
marketplace.
now
it
could
be,
i
do
not
think
it
extends
to
springfield
your
honor,
because
i
do
not
think
that
the
marketplace
extends
to
springfield,
but
the
marketplace
under
some
circumstance
might
include
two
or
three
communities
all
being
subject
to
a
steering
practice.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
yes
it
does.
i
think
that
in
this
instance
--
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
would
agree
that
it
is
very
limited
and
would
be
limited.
i
clearly
would
not
include
springfield.
and
as
we
move
in
from
the
springfield,
i
think
it
would
not
include
a
lot
of
other
things,
but
i
would
say
that
from
experience,
the
real
estate
marketplace
extends
beyond
sometimes
a
specific
community
and
there
is
--
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
they
were
about
22,000
at
this
time
your
honor
and
bellwood
interestingly
enough
was
a
very
built-up
community.
i
mean
it
was
a
community
which
developed
kind
of
the
same
kind
of
time,
had
a
lot
of
people
of
the
same
kind
of
background,
same
kind
of
homes
who
had
lived
there
for
quite
some
time.
it
had
a
lot
of
the
indices
of
a
very
close-knit
community,
with
people
with
similar
interests
and
similar
backgrounds.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
i
think
that
the
case
is
different
than
trafficante
in
that
respect
that
trafficante
was
a
particular
apartment
complex,
although
a
very,
very
big
one,
and
bellwood
is
different
because
it
is
homeowners,
it
is
a
community
itself
and
it
is
different
because
the
villages
involved
trying
to
protect
the
values
of
the
homes
from
being
depreciated
by
this
process
and
thereby
limiting
the
tax
pay.
so
there
are
those
differences.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
one
thing
that
is
stronger
here
and
that
is
that
these
home
owners
are
being
damaged
directly
by
an
attempt
to
change
the
process.
in
other
words,
change
it
from
an
integrated
community
to
an
all
black
community
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
is
even
a
stronger
injury
than
the
situation
and
where
in
trafficante
they
were
trying
to
keep
blacks
out
and
the
whites
wanted
to
make
it
an
open
community.
here,
the
community
and
the
municipality
have
worked
to
make
it
an
open
community
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
real
estate
industry
now
is
trying
to
turn
on
them
and
change
it
to
an
all
black
segregated
community.
so
i
think
it
is
a
little
stronger
in
that
regard,
but
it
is
broader
than
trafficante,
it
includes
more
people.
mr.
f.
willis
caruso
the
position
that
only
direct
purchasers
would
have
a
cause
of
action
does
not
seem
to
follow
anything
in
the
act
or
any
of
the
existing
decisions.
and
particularly
in
looking
at
3604,
for
example
on
advertising,
clearly
the
people
have
to
bring
a
suit
to
prevent
that
kind
of
advertising,
3604
(c)
and
3604
(e)
among
other
things
contemplate
the
kind
of
action
that
is
set
forth
here
and
in
addition,
all
of
the
district
courts
and
courts
of
appeals,
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
dealt
with
situations
where
many
different
kinds
of
parties
have
been
allowed
standing
under
3612,
when
there
has
been
an
injury
as
a
result
of
a
violation
of
the
fair
housing
act.
the
legislative
history
as
indicated
previously
in
some
discussion
on
questions
and
the
dirksen
involvement
in
that
indicates
that
3612
was
meant
to
be
a
strong
enforcement
tool
and
it
is
in
fact
necessary
to
make
this
fair
housing
law
work.
hud
is
very
busy
and
hud
is
doing
more
and
more,
but
it
is
important
and
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
it
was
intended
that
individual
people,
local
people,
like
the
people
in
this
community
would
have
a
right
to
act
or
work
together
to
try
to
protect
their
community
and
do
something
about
a
problem
they
see
as
being
very
important.
we
think
that
the
situation
here
presented
represents
individuals
and
the
municipality
who
are
directly
injured,
who
have
need
the
activity
here
locally
to
protect
their
community
and
to
try
to
maintain
a
healthy
viable
local
community,
that
the
legislative
history
supports
the
position
that
these
two
acts
should
be
enforced
separately
and
concurrently
as
is
necessary
along
with
other
ways
of
enforcing
these
laws
is
necessary
and
that
the
case
should
be
allowed
to
go
forward
and
that
the
proof
should
be
allowed
to
come
in
and
that
the
plaintiffs
should
be
allowed
to
show
these
steering
practices,
to
show
what
these
realtors
do,
to
try
to
change
the
neighborhoods
with
all
of
the
things
that
can
result
from
that,
like
the
problems
with
the
school
segregation
and
so
forth.
if
these
communities
can
be
kept
integrated
and
healthy
schools
can
be
maintained,
the
other
problems
of
segregation
can
be
helped
and
prevented
by
integrated
communities
and
we
respectfully
request
that
the
plaintiffs
here
be
allowed
to
proceed
to
show
these
violations,
to
present
the
evidence,
to
do
the
discovery
and
to
proceed
with
this
case.
i
would
like
to
with
the
indulgence
of
the
court
to
pass
on
what
remaining
time
i
may
have
to
the
united
states.
