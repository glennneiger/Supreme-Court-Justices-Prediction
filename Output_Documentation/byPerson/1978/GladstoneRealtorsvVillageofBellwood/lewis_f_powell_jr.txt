mr.
wallace,
is
there
any
cause
of
action
that
may
be
brought
under
the
act,
under
section
3610
requiring
extortion
of
administrative
remedies?
in
other
words,
does
the
option
always
prevail
with
respect
to
every
cause
of
action
of
the
fair
housing
act
to
go
directly
to
3612?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
are
the
advantages
of
using
3610?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
second
case
that
i
have
to
announce
is
gladstone
realtors
against
the
village
of
bellwood,
illinois.
this
case
involves
a
suit
under
section
812
of
the
fair
housing
act
of
1968.
the
respondents
in
this
court
were
the
plaintiffs
below,
they
are
the
village
of
bellwood
and
certain
of
its
residence,
the
petitioners
here
who
were
defendants
in
this
suit
are
bellwood
real
estate
brokers
and
their
employees.
the
complain
alleged
that
the
real
estate
firms
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
fair
housing
act
were
steering
perspective
home
purchasers
away
from
integrated
sections
of
the
village
and
indeed,
some
white
home
buyers
were
being
stirred
away
from
bellwood
to
neighborhood
communities.
the
case
is
before
us
not
on
its
merits
but
on
the
threshold
question
whether
the
plaintiffs
have
standing
to
bring
this
suit
since
none
of
them
personally
was
attempting
to
purchase
a
home.
they
were
however
residents
of
bellwood
and
together
with
the
village
wished
to
preserve
its
integrated
composition.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
plaintiffs
did
have
standing
to
sue.
we
agree
and
today
affirm
that
decision.
in
the
court's
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
addressed
both
the
question
of
standing
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution
and
a
statutory
question
whether
section
812
of
the
act
contemplated
suits
such
as
this.
as
our
analysis
of
these
questions,
it
cannot
be
summarized
briefly.
i
will
say
only
that
in
an
earlier
case,
trafficante
against
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
company,
we
sustained
standing
under
section
810
of
the
act
of
plaintiffs
who
wish
to
preserve
the
integrated
character
of
a
large
apartment
complex.
we
conclude
today
that
much
of
the
reasoning
in
our
decision
with
respect
to
section
810
applies
also
to
this
action
brought
under
section
812.
we
think
that
the
village
of
bellwood,
a
municipality
and
its
residents
who
instituted
this
suit,
have
averred
actual
injury
as
a
result
of
the
racial
steering
allegedly
practice
by
the
real
estate
firms.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
stewart
has
joined.
