mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
jonathan
howe,
representing
the
petitioner,
defendants
in
this
case
--
in
these
cases
of
gladstone
realtors
and
hintze
realtors
versus
village
of
bellwood.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
by
way
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
which
the
order
as
granting
writ
has
stated
the
caution
presented
as
whether
natural
persons
and
municipalities
who
are
not
direct
victims
of
discrimination
in
the
sale
or
rental
of
housing
have
any
rights
under
article
iii
of
the
united
states
constitution
or
under
sections
1982,
3604,
3612
of
title
42
of
the
united
states
code,
to
bring
a
suit
against
real
estate
brokers
who
they
allege
to
have
engaged
in
racial
steering
on
the
theory,
that
racial
steering
interferes
with
such
persons’
generalized
interest
in
living
in
an
integrated
society.
our
oral
argument
this
morning
shall
focus
upon
the
statutory
construction
of
sections
3604
and
3612,
which
will
require
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
be
reversed,
because
these
plaintiffs
cannot
state
a
cause
of
action
under
3604
or
3612
of
title
42.
it
is
our
contention
that
section
3612
on
its
face
provides
for
the
enforcement
of
certain
enumerated
rights
under
section
3604
and
these
plaintiffs
before
this
court
possess
none
of
these
rights
and
therefore
have
no
standing
to
pursue
or
to
bring
the
cause
of
action.
section
3612,
it
is
our
contention,
must
be
read
as
a
complementary
enforcement
provision
of
the
fair
housing
act,
not
as
an
alternative
for
section
3610.
3610
has
a
much
broader
range
of
complainants,
the
person
aggrieved
concept,
those
claiming
injury
or
to
have
been
injured
as
a
result
of
a
discriminatory
housing
practice
is
far
broader
than
that
which
is
provided
under
section
3612.
in
addition,
the
legislative
history
of
the
fair
housing
act
is
not
contrary
to
the
position
of
these
defendants.
it
is
incomprehensible,
that
congress
would
provide
in
section
3610
for
an
administrative
and
agency
program
and
deferral
to
states
and
local
governments
and
then
two
sections
later,
totally
abandon
and
provide
a
mechanism
by
which
that
provision
of
3610
could
be
frustrated
and
evaded
for
all
claimants.
as
to
section
1982,
it
is
the
position
of
the
defendants
in
this
case,
that
plaintiffs
have
failed
to
state
a
claim
under
that
section
and
now
the
decision
of
this
court
in
warth
v.
seldin
decided
in
1985
is
dispositive
of
the
claims
raised
by
the
plaintiffs
under
section
1982.
these
cases
were
brought
by
identical
plaintiffs
in
two
actions
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
the
plaintiffs
that
are
before
this
court
include
the
village
of
bellwood
and
illinois
municipal
corporation
and
six
individuals,
four
of
whom
are
white
and
all
residents
of
bellwood
and
two
blacks,
one
of
whom
is
a
resident
of
bellwood
and
one
a
resident
of
another
municipality.
the
defendants
in
the
first
case
include
gladstone
realtors,
a
real
estate
brokerage
firm
in
illinois
and
six
of
its
sales
people.
the
second
case
involves
robert
a
hintze,
a
sole
proprietorship,
the
owner
of
that
firm
and
two
of
his
sales
people.
the
plaintiffs
allege
in
their
complaints
that
the
defendants
had
engaged
in
illegal
racial
steering
and
the
defendants
are
charged
that
they
undertook
efforts
to
influence
the
choice
of
perspective
home
buyers
on
the
basis
of
race
and
discouraged
prospective
black
home
buyers
from
purchasing
homes
in
white
areas
on
the
basis
of
race.
jurisdiction
is
posited
in
part
upon
section
3612
of
articles
or
title
42.
in
the
complaints,
the
plaintiffs
sought
declaratory
release,
injunctive
relief,
and
over
$300,000
in
damages.
the
injury
that
was
alleged
to
have
been
sustained
by
the
village
of
bellwood
was
that
its
housing
market
had
been
wrongfully
and
illegally
manipulated
to
the
economic
and
social
determent
of
the
citizens
of
such
village.
the
individual
plaintiffs
base
their
injury
on
two
different
theories.
the
first
theory
was
that
the
individual
plaintiffs
had
been
denied
their
right
to
select
housing
without
regard
to
race.
the
second
theory
they
claim
that
they
had
been
deprived
of
the
social
and
professional
benefits
of
living
in
an
integrated
society.
pursuant
to
discovery
and
as
a
result
of
discovery
request
made
by
the
defendants,
the
individual
plaintiffs
admitted
that
none
of
them
had
ever
intended
during
the
period
at
issue
to
purchase
or
rent
a
home
in
bellwood
or
to
purchase
or
rent
a
home
through
the
services
of
any
of
the
defendants
in
this
case.
based
upon
that
discovery,
the
defendants
proceeded
to
file
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
in
both
cases.
the
plaintiffs,
it
was
contended,
had
not
set
forth
a
cause
of
action
under
sections
1982,
3604
or
3612
and
alternatively
that
plaintiffs
had
failed
to
demonstrate
the
existence
of
a
case
of
controversy
under
article
iii.
subsequently,
judge
decker
in
the
gladstone
case
held
and
ruled
in
favor
of
the
motion
and
held
that
the
individual
plaintiffs
were
only
testers
and
not
bona
fide
homeseekers
and
therefore
could
not
be
denied
the
right
to
select
housing
without
regard
to
race.
at
most,
judge
decker
found
that
the
individual
plaintiffs
had
suffered
was
the
indirect
or
generalized
injury
of
being
denied
the
benefits
of
living
in
an
integrated
society.
judge
decker
relied
in
large
part
upon
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
topic
versus
circle
realty.
in
that
case,
the
ninth
circuit
had
held
that
a
cause
of
action
under
section
3612
exists
only
for
a
direct
victim
of
a
prescribed
practice
under
section
3604.
the
court
went
on
to
hold
that
the
village
of
bellwood
had
not
suffered
any
cognizable
injury.
subsequently,
judge
perry
in
the
hintze
case
adopted
judge
decker’s
decision
and
the
case
went
on
appeal
to
the
seventh
circuit.
there
the
seventh
circuit
found
that
the
individual
plaintiffs
themselves
had
not
been
denied
the
right
to
purchase
or
rent
housing
without
regard
to
race,
because
the
plaintiffs
did
not
possess
a
good
faith
interest
to
enter
into
the
housing
market
and
the
plaintiffs’
allegations
to
the
contrary
in
the
complaint
had
been
foreclosed
by
their
admissions
through
the
discovery
process.
therefore,
testers
qua
testers
did
not
have
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
no
sir,
there
was
not,
no
cross-petition
has
been
filed
in
this
case.
the
seventh
circuit
went
on
however
to
hold
that
the
plaintiffs
claim
that
they
had
been
denied
the
right
to
live
in
an
integrated
society,
was
cognizable
under
section
3604
and
3612.
the
court
made
no
decision
as
to
the
claims
under
section
1982.
the
seventh
circuit,
it
is
our
position,
erroneously
relied
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
in
trafficante
versus
metropolitan
life
insurance,
where
this
court
held
under
section
3610
that
residents
of
an
apartment
complex
could
complain
that
their
landlord’s
rental
practices
deprived
them
of
the
social
and
professional
benefits
of
living
in
an
integrated
community.
the
seventh
circuit
while
noting
that
trafficante
was
not
technically
controlling,
felt
that
its
thrust
and
its
rational
suggests
that
individual
plaintiffs
have
standing
to
allege
deprivation
of
a
right
to
live
in
an
integrated
society
under
section
3612.
the
court
specifically
rejected
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
topic
case.
as
to
the
village,
the
court
went
on
to
find
without
any
allegations
in
the
complaint
to
support
the
conclusion
that
it
was
apparent
that
the
concrete
injury
with
a
substantial
nexus
to
the
village’s
status
as
a
unit
of
government
could
be
proved.
based
upon
that
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit,
this
writ
was
granted.
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioners
and
the
defendants
that
section
3612
does
not
authorize
the
filing
in
a
united
states
district
court
of
a
cause
of
action
by
the
same
class
of
plaintiffs
as
would
be
permitted
to
file
a
cause
of
action
after
the
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedies
under
section
3610.
section
3612
provides
that
the
rights
granted
by
section
3604
may
be
enforced
in
an
appropriate
united
states
district
court.
thus
3612,
it
is
our
position,
limits
the
rights
that
can
be
enforced
to
those
under
3604.
3604
provides
five
distinct
categories
of
rights
and
practices
which
it
declares
to
be
unlawful.
not
one
of
those
five
categories
includes
a
right
or
generalized
interest
to
live
in
an
integrated
society,
nor
do
any
of
the
five
categories
provide
any
generalized
right
or
interest
to
protect
the
economic
and
social
interests
of
citizens
for
manipulation
by
racial
steering.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
for
the
procedural
process
of
this
case
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
it
is
arguable
and
there
is
substantial
case
law
in
the
lower
courts
that
racial
steering
as
to
a
direct
victim
of
such
a
racial
practice
does
have
a
cause
of
action.
there
are
some
other
cases
–
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
if
the
allegations
are
true,
there
is
a
violation
of
3604.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
for
purposes
of
our
argument
today,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
also
note
that
3612
by
limiting
access
to
the
federal
courts
to
those
five
categories
is
part
of
a
broader
base
of
the
entire
statute.
we
must
look
at
the
entire
fair
housing
act
to
determine
and
to
see
whether
the
sections
as
defined
by
congress
provide
a
harmonious
hope.
the
seventh
circuit
disregarded
this
argument.
it
did
not
even
address
it.
it
is
our
suggestion
in
our
argument
that
we
must
compare
section
3610
with
3612
and
we
must
read
them
together.
now,
section
3610
addresses
itself
to
the
concept
of
injury
sustained
as
a
result
of
housing
discrimination
by
a
person
aggrieved.
in
warth
versus
seldin,
this
court
characterized
the
decision
in
trafficante
and
section
3610
as
giving
residence
of
housing
facilities
and
actionable
right
to
be
free
from
adverse
consequences
to
them
of
racially
discriminatory
practices
directed
at
and
immediately
harmful
to
others,
because
they
were
persons
aggrieved,
which
is
a
term
of
art
we
submit,
to
give
broader
opportunities
to
a
class
of
claimants.
3612,
as
noted,
addresses
itself
to
rights,
not
to
injury.
purely
for
the
sake
of
example,
this
court
has
held
in
several
cases
that
even
if
a
person
is
injured
as
a
result
of
an
invasion
of
a
constitutional
right
of
another
person,
that
injured
person
cannot
seek
redress
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
an
absent
third
party.
in
fact
in
the
(inaudible)
decision
and
stated
that
the
established
principle
is
that
suspension
of
the
product
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation
can
be
successfully
urged
only
by
those
whose
rights
were
violated
by
the
search
itself,
not
by
those
who
are
aggrieved
solely
by
the
introduction
of
the
damaging
evidence
and
thus
3610
does
provide
a
cause
of
action
however
to
these
people
who
have
sustained
some
injury.
they
are
persons
aggrieved
and
consistent
with
the
decision
in
trafficante,
which
does
provide
for
the
concept
of
the
private
attorney
general.
we
have
to
look
at
this
word
of
art
of
person
aggrieved.
it
does
have
significance.
congress
has
used
that
terminology
only
when
it
has
wanted
to
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
to
hear
claims.
it
has
a
well
defined
meaning
in
the
case
law
of
this
country
and
as
trafficante
shows,
the
concept
is
to
extend
the
broadest
and
possible
standing
under
article
iii
for
the
injury
sustained.
we
do
not
need
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
for
the
fair
housing
act
in
this
case,
because
as
this
court
stated
in
the
kepner
case,
it
is
a
well
settled
rule
that
the
construction
of
language
in
a
statute
which
has
a
well
settled
and
well
known
meaning
sanctioned
by
judicial
decision
is
presumed
–
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
surely.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
would
have
to
depend
upon
the
extent
to
which
the
decision
of
this
court
in
trafficante
would
be
extended
or
broadened
to
cover
the
class
of
plaintiffs
in
this
particular
litigation.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
we
take
no
position
because
no
action
has
been
raised
under
3610
for
these
plaintiffs.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
the
injury
that
they
allege
to
have
occurred
to
them
is
a
result
of
an
alleged
unlawful
housing
practice
directed
to
third
parties.
they
have
claimed
--
they
did
claim
that
they
had
been
injured
in
their
personal
right
to
select
housing.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
but
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
held
that
this
was
not
the
case
since
they
were
not
bona
fide
homeseekers.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
under
3612,
they
are
supposed
to
[voice
overlap]
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
our
contention
your
honor
is
that
3612
in
no
way
includes
the
definition
of
persons
aggrieved
as
being
a
person
who
can
bring
an
action.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
none
whatsoever.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
it
does
not
have
limiting
language,
but
our
concept
of
the
statutory
scheme
is
that
in
order
to
give
meaning
to
the
statutory
scheme,
we
must
hold
that
3610
does
have
a
broader
class
of
claimants
that
can
bring
an
action
or
bring
up
the
process
into
force
than
that
which
would
be
allowed
under
3612.
if
in
one
hand
we
establish
a
right
to
go
forward
as
a
person
aggrieved
in
3610
and
then
two
sections
later,
we
say,
well,
you
can
bypass
that
administrative
process,
you
can
bypass
the
state
and
local
remedies
that
are
available,
you
can
bypass
the
exemption
or
the
deferral
to
a
state
court
by
filing
under
3612,
the
whole
concept
of
two
separate
distinct
complementary
enforcement
sections,
it
is
our
contention,
is
lost.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
that
is
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
towards
of
course
we
take
exception.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
no
your
honor,
it
is
not,
because
in
the
–
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
you
have
to
understand
that
–
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
yes
he
did
your
honor.
the
floor
manager
stated
that
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
based
upon
an
opinion
that
they
received
from
the
attorney
general
that
3610
and
3612
were
alternative
remedies.
we
agree
with
that
for
a
direct
victim,
a
person
whose
rights
have
been
infringed,
but
as
to
a
person
as
an
indirect
victim
who
is
asserting
the
rights
of
absent
third
parties
by
virtue
of
having
suffered
some
kind
of
injury
themselves,
we
submit
that
was
not
considered
whatsoever
during
any
of
the
legislative
debate.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
there
is
no
language
whatsoever
your
honor
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
ever
considered
or
gave
thought
to
an
indirect
victim
bringing
an
action
under
this
act.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
yes
your
honor,
he
is
--
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
our
statement
your
honor
is
that
congressman
seller
when
he
was
working
with
the
bill,
looked
at
3610
and
3612
as
being
alternatives
for
a
direct
victim.
we
do
not
find
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
fair
housing
act
that
congress
ever
gave
consideration
to
the
class
of
plaintiffs
that
are
before
the
court
today.
we
think
that
this
court,
however,
properly
construed
in
trafficante
the
concept
of
person
aggrieved
to
being
a
broader
base
area
for
a
person
to
bring
a
claim,
but
when
it
came
to
3612,
that
was
not
the
intention
of
congress.
we
have
got
to
remember
that
the
fair
housing
act
was
an
act
that
came
through
great
compromise.
it
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
any
committee
hearing.
so
it
was
hammered
out
on
the
floors
of
congress
without
committee
hearings
or
committee
reports.
and
thus,
much
of
what
may
be
said
on
the
floor
of
congress
relative
to
what
was
intended
by
the
legislation,
we
would
submit
your
honor,
may
not
be
worth
much
for
purposes
of
interpreting
a
statutory
scheme
which
we
think
on
its
face
is
relatively
clear.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
no,
i
am
certainly
not.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
for
one
minute.
i
am
suggesting
that
when
he
was
speaking
however,
he
was
speaking
solely
of
people
who
were
direct
victims,
not
indirect
victims.
and
therefore
based
upon
that
theory,
i
think
you
can
see
a
pattern
between
the
two
and
then
when
this
court
in
trafficante
took
the
concept
of
person
aggrieved
for
section
3610
case
and
extended
it
to
the
broadest
limits
permitted
by
article
iii,
that
was
consistent
with
the
word
of
art
of
person
aggrieved.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
your
honor,
that
question
has
been
raised
by
the
respondents
and
while
it
is
true
that
there
had
been
an
intervention
filed
in
the
court
below
under
3612,
the
decision
of
this
court
addresses
itself
solely
to
section
3610.
it
does
mention
as
part
of
the
statutory
enforcement
scheme,
the
existence
of
not
only
section
3612
but
also
3613.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
you
did
not
put
it
aside,
but
you
did
not
address
it
and
justice
douglas
in
his
decision
stated
that
all
other
issues,
there
was
no
opinion
of
the
court
and
that
the
court
was
not
going
to
address
those.
in
the
warth
decision
and
in
other
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
courts
which
have
looked
at
the
trafficante
decision,
they
have
viewed
them
as
being
a
decision
under
section
3610
and
the
language
contained
there.
it
states
that
only
can
you
give
vitality
to
section
3610
by
a
generous
construction
which
goes
to
standing
to
suit
to
all
in
the
same
housing
unit
who
are
injured
by
the
management
of
that
particular
housing
unit
and
that,
that
can
be
within
the
ambient
of
the
statute
under
section
3610.
we
have
got
to
look
in
–
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
yes
sir.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
there
is
indeed.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
when
you
talk
of
injury,
you
talk
about
something
that
somebody
has
incurred
as
a
result
of
a
housing
discrimination.
maybe
that
housing
discrimination
was
not
directed
at
them,
but
they
do
sustain
some
injury
whereas
with
the
right,
we
contend
your
honor
that,
that
is
individual.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
no,
your
honor
and
we
submit
the
reason
that
we
cannot
do
that
is
because
congress
never
considered
the
distinction
between
a
direct
or
indirect
victim
but
rather
throughout,
the
thread
of
the
legislative
history
was
that
they
were
talking
about
people
who
were
barred
access
to
housing.
they
were
talking
of
direct
victims.
i
do
not
think
you
will
find
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
anything
which
would
indicate
that
a
party
has
a
right
to
assert
rights
of
an
absent
third-party
in
the
legislative
history
and
also
in
the
legislative
history,
the
difference
between
--
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
as
far
as
the
direct
victim,
yes
your
honor,
we
concede
that.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
that
is
correct,
until
the
decision
of
this
court
in
trafficante
which
extended
the
concept
of
person
aggrieved.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
but
prior
to
that,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
at
all
which
would
support
any
finding
that
the
concept
of
an
indirect
victim
was
to
have
any
kind
of
right
under
either
810
or
812.
and
i
think
--
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
your
honor,
that
is
not
a
decision
that
has
to
be
reached
by
this
court.
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
while
not
addressing
it,
but
by
using
that
term
person
aggrieved
in
810
that
you
could
sustain
the
decision
that
you
reached
in
trafficante.
personally,
we
might
take
a
different
position
in
that,
but
i
think
that
as
far
as
the
decision
of
this
court
in
trafficante
in
construing
the
traditional
concept
of
person
aggrieved
--
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
i
would
concur
that
the
silence
of
congress
and
as
mr.
justice
douglas
suggested,
the
legislative
history
of
the
fair
housing
act
is
a
very
little
help
in
trying
to
interpret
what
the
act
was
intended
to
cover.
i
think
that
the
impact
of
congress
again
looking
at
the
basic
statutory
scheme
shows
that
under
3610
that
the
concept
was
of
having
some
kind
of
ameliorating
process
of
requiring
a
person
to
file
a
compliant
with
the
secretary
of
hud
to
have
30
days
for
conciliation
and
if
there
were
state
or
local
agencies
which
had
substantially
equivalent
remedies
and
rights
that
there
should
be
a
deferral
to
the
state
and
local
governments
so
that
there
could
be
a
conservation
of
judicial
time,
that
those
people
who
work
perhaps
in
a
broader
position
than
those
who
would
be
having
their
rights
infringed
under
3612
would
first
go
through
that
administrative
process,
because
3612
has
no
preconditions
to
invoking
federal
jurisdiction.
and
we
would
consider
that
part
of
the
pattern
again,
the
intention
of
congress
was
to
provide
these
two
vehicles
for
enforcement.
one
of
a
less
adversary
context
under
3610
with
a
broader
spectrum
of
individuals
who
could
bring
a
complaint
under
3610
and
that
they
could
also
do
that
without
having
to
go
into
a
court
for
purposes
of
achieving
their
rights.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
we
can
construe
it
that
way
because
it
provides
specifically
in
810,
how
a
person
may
go
to
court
after
having
instituted
the
process
of
filing
a
complaint
with
the
secretary,
the
referral
to
a
state
agency
the
unsatisfactory
solution
to
that
problem
and
then
allowing
a
person
to
go
into
a
united
states
district
court.
we
think
that
is
a
pattern
that
flows
through
810,
there
is
no
–
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
he
is
under
section
810,
810(d).
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
cause
of
action
was
given
in
the
810
(a),
which
states
that
any
person
who
is
harmed,
any
person
aggrieved
by
an
unlawful
housing
discrimination
may
file
a
compliant
and
then
we
follow
through
the
process.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
it
gives
them
a
cause
of
action
after
they
have
exhausted
their
administrative
remedy,
then
they
proceed
to
file
a
case
in
court.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
the
court
could
be
wrong
your
honor,
but
you
do
not
have
to
reach
that
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
we
would
disagree
your
honor
on
the
basis
that
in
order
for
a
person
first
of
all
under
section
810
to
be
able
to
proceed
under
810,
if
they
are
a
person
aggrieved,
it
is
much
broader.
if
they
go
to
812,
there
is
no
similar
language
in
812
for
a
person
aggrieved.
thus,
if
they
were
found
to
be
a
person
aggrieved
under
810
–
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
that
is
correct
to
that
top
--
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
i
think
that
these
rights
referenced
your
honor
would
be
to
--
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
basically,
it
is
that
would
be
the
individual
rights
but
you
can
proceed
if
you
are
a
direct
victim
under
810
or
812,
indirect
would
only
be
able
to
go
through
810
and
the
action
would
be
brought
pursuant
to
810.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
the
preamble
of
the
fair
housing
act
states
as
an
objective
of
this
country
to
provide
for
free
and
open
access
to
housing.
as
to
how
far
the
scale
should
be
weighed
or
challenged
or
changed,
i
think
that
with
the
statutory
scheme
as
it
presently
set
forth
with
allowing
an
indirect
victim
who
meets
the
standing
requirements
as
set
forth
in
the
trafficante
decision
to
proceed
under
810
gives
relief
to
those
indirect
victims
whereas
we
reserve
in
812,
the
opportunity
to
those
people
who
suffer
an
immediate
and
direct
violation
of
their
rights
under
section
3604
to
immediately
have
the
access
to
a
federal
court.
if
they
need
an
injunction
to
stop
the
sale
of
property,
which
they
have
had
an
interest
in
and
had
been
deprived
of
because
of
some
kind
of
discriminatory
act,
then
i
think
we
have
protected
the
interests
of
those
people
who
suffer
a
direct
immediate
injury
by
letting
them
go
immediately
into
federal
court.
whereas
those
who
may
have
a
broader
spectrum
of
a
compliant,
they
may
go
through
the
administrative
process,
it
allows
for
that
amelioration,
it
allows
for
that
conciliation
and
many
times
may
result
in
a
remedy,
which
would
be
far
better
than
a
remedy
that
might
be
obtained
in
court.
and
we
would
suggest
your
honor
that
the
two
sections
are
not
alternatives
because
if
we
are
to
treat
them
as
alternatives
and
you
allow
a
person
to
immediately
go
to
3612
who
was
an
indirect
victim,
you
dislocate
the
whole
administrative
scheme
and
i
think
also
because
of
the
reference
in
810
to
state
and
local
governmental
bodies
and
their
ability
to
promulgate
fair
housing
laws,
but
this
would
destroy
the
incentive
for
them
to
go
forward,
because
if
everything
is
going
to
be
decided
in
a
federal
district
court,
then
what
should
they
do
or
why
should
they
proceed.
the
scheme
of
congress
was
to
share
that
responsibility
with
the
state
and
local
governments.
and
in
fact,
during
the
debate
on
that
--
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
that
is
correct.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
no,
i
do
not
think
any
inference
should
be
drawn
from
that
at
all
except
to
allow
or
to
create
and
say
that
the
rights
given
under
this
statute
may
be
enforced
alternatively
in
a
state
court
by
a
direct
victim.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
that
is
correct
also
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
your
honor,
we
go
back
to
the
concept
again
of
injury
versus
right.
the
rights
that
they
have
asserted
are
those
rights
which
are
contained
in
section
3604
in
1982.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
yes
and
that
injury
that
this
claim
was
deprivation
of
the
right
to
live
in
an
integrated
society
and
there
is
no
where
in
3604
any
corollary
right
to
the
right
to
live
in
an
integrated
society.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
their
allegation
is
that
as
a
result
of
there
having
been
some
infringe
to
the
third
parties
--
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
that
the
rights
that
they
say
or
the
rights
that
they
say
were
infringed
was
racial
steering
against
absent
third
parties
and
as
a
result
of
that
steering
against
those
third
parties
which
would
be
made
unlawful
under
3604.
they
have
suffered
injury
because
they
have
been
deprived
of
that
right
to
live
in
an
integrated
community.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
well,
i
think
the
concept
of
trafficante
does
show
that
this
court
did
consider
section
810
to
confer
broad
standing
of
the
person
aggrieved
concept
and
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
its
absence
of
any
person
aggrieved
language
in
section
812,
this
court
should
not
imply
person
aggrieved
in
section
812.
if
there
is
to
be
broader
jurisdiction
under
section
812,
it
should
be
congress
and
not
the
court
that
grants
it
by
virtue
of
letting
congress
put
in
the
term
of
art
person
aggrieved,
if
that
is
their
intention
to
allow
direct
access
to
indirect
victims
of
racial
discrimination.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
if
i
may.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
yes,
may
it
please
the
court.
much
has
been
said
about
the
trafficante
decision
in
this
argument.
i
think
the
court's
attention
should
be
directed
to
page
212
of
the
opinion
wherein
the
court
stated,
we
reverse
and
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
leaving
untouched
all
other
questions.
and
i
think
this
follows
right
after
the
statement
by
mr.
justice
douglas
stating,
we
can
give
vitality
to
section
810
(a)
only
by
a
generous
construction.
so
i
think
that
all
other
questions
in
trafficante
were
reserved
and
untouched
by
this
court.
one
other
factual
--
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
that
is
correct
also
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
it
did
not
mention
it
in
the
footnote
but
it
dealt
with
the
1982
but
it
did
in
this
language
at
the
end,
and
then
taking
your
concurring
opinion
to
mr.
justice
white
wherein
you
stated
that
you
would
limit
it
to
the
facts
of
the
case
as
presented.
one
other
fact
which
is
extremely
important
in
the
trafficante
decision
is
that
the
action
was
brought
against
a
single
landlord
who
alone
controlled
access
to
that
apartment
complex.
no
one
has
alleged
nor
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
the
two
realtors
doing
business
outside
of
the
village
of
bellwood
itself
have
a
dramatic
impact
upon
housing
patterns
within
bellwood.
mr.
jonathan
t.
howe
it
could
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
the
fact
that
we
like
to
point
out
is
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
class
of
defendants
in
trafficante
as
to
the
class
of
defendant
in
this
particular
case.
the
concept
of
the
public
policy
argument
as
advanced
by
the
united
states,
no
showing
has
been
made
that
by
opening
an
opportunity
under
section
3612
to
indirect
victims
that
the
policy
of
the
fair
housing
act
would
be
advanced.
and
we
would
submit
that
it
would
be
to
the
contrary
because
it
would
provide
a
mechanism
by
which
the
entire
metrics
of
an
administrative
remedy
through
section
3610
could
be
avoided
and
circumvented.
we
think
that
the
language
of
section
3610
of
person
aggrieved
is
unique
and
the
failure
of
congress
to
include
that
language
specifically
in
section
3612
indicated
a
different
view
by
congress
and
we
need
to
only
look
at
the
natural
meaning
of
the
words
contained
in
the
statute
to
go
forward
with
that.
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general's
office
lacked
staff
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
make
any
consideration
as
to
how
it
is
going
to
interpret
a
statute.
it
must
do
that
solely
and
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
what
is
contained
in
the
statute.
we
submit
that
we
know
of
no
other
statute
in
the
united
states
that
would
allow
the
systematic
circumvention
of
remedies,
if
this
court
is
to
adopt
the
position
that
has
been
advanced
by
the
plaintiffs.
it
is
necessary
to
confine
an
actionable
claim
within
the
limits
of
the
language
used
by
congress
and
consistent
with
the
logic
that
is
embodied
in
that
statutory
scheme
rather
than
allowing
it
to
extend
beyond
the
intentions
of
congress.
thank
you.
