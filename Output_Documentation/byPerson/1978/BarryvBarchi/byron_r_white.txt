justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
have
it
in
mind,
what
was
imposed
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
was
the
total
punishment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
not
permanent.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
by
the
time
there
could
be
any
review,
the
suspension
the
entire
punishment
would
have
been
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
15
days
is
15
days
but
--
and
you
had
30
days.
there
are
30
days
for
a
review,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
says
--
it
says
that
the
suspensions
will
stay
in
effect,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
the
board
could
say
--
to
tell
somebody
that
we're
considering
any
suspension
and
just
not
impose
it
until
there
is
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
it
just
that
they
regularly
disobey
the
statute,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
representing
the
state
of
new
york,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
under
what
section
did
the
steward
issues
a
suspension?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
what
authorized
him
to
issue
the
suspension?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
who
issued
the
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
that
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
commission?
is
that
the
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
in
section
8022,
it
refers
to
a
racing
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they'd
issued
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
their
stewards
are
their
agents
authorized
to
make
the
suspensions?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
suspension
in
effect
was
issued
by
the
commission
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
do
you
have
the
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
that
gives
--
i
take
it
that
that
refers
to
the
board
or
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
alright.
we
can
--
we
got
it.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
15
days.
a
suspension
here
is
15
days.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
after
the
15
days
expired,
he
is
free
to
practice
this
free
trade
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
standard
would
be
in
a
hearing
--
in
a
pre-suspension
hearing
or
hearing
within
48
hours
of
the
suspension?
would
the
pending
some
full
evidentiary
hearing
with
the
standard
be
simply
probable
cause
to
believe?
that's
all
it
was
in
bell
against
burson.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
would
satisfy,
do
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
in
bell
against
burson,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
you've
--
that
fall
to
an
accident,
you
lose
your
driver's
license,
you
may
lose
your
job
because
you
can't
get
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
8022
is
no
longer
in
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
statute
involved
here
is
no
longer
in
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
suggest
it
would
be
unconstitutional
of
new
york
simply
made
trainers
liable
for
the
condition
of
the
horse
and
suspended
them
without
proof
of
fault?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
a
trainer
has
custody
of
the
horse,
the
state
says
if
the
horse
has
its
proof
to
have
drugs
in
it,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter,
that's
the
trainer's
responsibility.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
the
state
made
in
responsible
for
the
exclusive
care
and
custody.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
i
understand
that
the
district
court,
it
didn't
say
the
presumptions
were
irrebuttable,
it
said
they
were
rebuttable.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
that
it
turns
on
some
kind
of
fault
doesn't
it,
rather
than
some
absolute
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
gave
you
a
couple
of
test
or
at
least
one
and
as
far
as
we
know,
they
investigate
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
you
know
--
so
what
you
say
you
pass
the
exam,
what
did
they
say
to
you,
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
part
of
the
record,
what
they
said
to
you
at
the
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
they
make
a
finding.
