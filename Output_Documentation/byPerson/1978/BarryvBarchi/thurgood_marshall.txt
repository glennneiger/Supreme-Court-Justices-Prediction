justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
significance
of
a
regulation,
a
statute
or
any
provision
which
says
one
thing
and
we
have
assurance
that
the
present
people
in
office
won't
enforce
it.
what
effect
does
that
have
on
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
--
is
there
anything
in
there
that
said
what
the
future
people
will
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
no
way
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
no
way
you
can
predict
what
a
future
official
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
proven
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
always?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
in
the
discretion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
never
--
please,
i
have
never
suspended
a
jockey.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
the
discretionary
authority
to
ignore
a
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
interpret
it
and
say
no
when
it
says
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
larger
than
the
chance
to
a
foot.
i've
never
seen
a
chance
with
a
foot
that
large
before.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
if
the
majority
of
this
court
noted
it
on
--
just
on
the
pullman
point
because
you
don't
know,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
alleging
something
in
your
jurisdictional
statement
and
then
not
following
it.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
his
refusal
to
ask
for
a
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
a
part
of
that
his
refusal
to
ask
for
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
of
this
that
is
going
to
happen
to
the
rest
of
his
life,
he
could
have
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
help
me
with
this.(voice
overlap)
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
suppose
it
showed
that
he
was
in
the
hospital
for
the
past
three
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
least
he
could
show
that
at
the
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we're
dealing
with
dumping
of
horses,
how
would
you
handle
it
to
prevent
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
to
prove
that
he
administered
the
drug?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
i
have
never
heard
of
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
out
in
the
public
to
do
with
that.
that
maybe
something
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
sorry
mr.
faraldo,
i
ask
you
the
question.
let's
regard
to
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
don't
you
do
something
to
breakdown
the
inference
that
harness
racing
horses
aren't
thoroughbreds?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
not
thoroughbreds.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
a
thoroughbred
mentioned
knew
your
mom
and
your
papa.
