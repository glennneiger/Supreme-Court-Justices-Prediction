justice
john
paul
stevens
general
hammer,
could
i
just
ask
one
question
about
when
they
find
the
drug
--
evidence
of
drug
in
the
horse
and
it's
presumed
that
the
drug
affected
the
performance
of
the
animal
in
the
race
as
i
understand
your
rules,
does
that
mean
that
something
is
done
with
the
race
itself
or
the
results
change
or
is
there
anything
to
undo
the
harmful
consequence
to
the
public
of
the
race
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
any
discipline
against
anyone
other
than
the
trainer
if
we
held
to
that
finding
in
that
presumption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
mean
supposing
it's
a
mystery
as
to
what
really
happened
but
just
from
the
presumption
itself
which
includes
the
presumption
that
performance
of
the
animal
was
affected
by
it
which
of
course
would
affect
the
owner's
record
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
nothing
happens
to
anyone
except
to
the
trainer
as
a
result
of
that
presumption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
hammer
can
i
also
clear
up
one
thing.
does
the
first
automatically
become
forfeited
with
just
on
the
basis
of
the
presumption?
that
you
said
he
had
power
to
forfeit
the
purse
but
is
it
the
routine
practice
that
for
example
in
this
case
was
the
purse
forfeit
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
hammer,
could
i
ask
you
another
question
about
this
language.
you
point
out
that
the
affidavit
of
john
dailey
indicates
there
is
a
practice.
now,
the
statute
refers
an
action
of
the
commission.
but
dailey's
affidavit
refers
to
a
suspension
of
any
penalty
imposed
by
track
judges
pending
administrative
review.
what
are
track
judge
--
track
judges?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
the
commission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
the
statute
and
the
affidavit
because
the
affidavit
talks
about
staying
a
penalty
imposed
by
track
judges
whereas
the
statute
refers
to
an
order
that
the
commission
remaining
in
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
we
just
accept
the
statute
and
there
is
no
conflict
in
the
record
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hammer
may
i
get
a
question
into
this
particular
sentence
in
the
statute
has
not
been
construed
by
your
state
courts,
has
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
you
completed
your
answer
to
justice
white.
precisely,
what
section
of
the
regulations
authorized
the
suspension?
i
think
you
started
to
tell
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
page
5a.--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
none
of
those
sections
refer
to
suspension
of
a
trainer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
a
standard
set
forth
in
that
earlier
regulation
of
when
there
shall
be
a
suspension?
in
other
words,
is
it
automatic?
is
it
after
a
finding
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
it
or
what
is
the
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
the
section
is
--
i'm
sorry.
section
8009
of
the
unconsolidated
laws
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
to
make
one
point
clear.
you
do
not
contend
that
there
is
any
flat
rule
that
requires
suspension
of
the
trainer
whenever
a
drug
is
found
in
a
horse
that
he
trained.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
to
put
it
bluntly
that
if
the
track
judges
or
the
commissioners
have
decided
to
believe
the
lie
detector
results
and
thought
this
man
was
totally
innocent,
they
could
have
not
suspended
him
without
violating
any
state
law
they
could
have
had.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
does
the
record
that
tells
us
why
they
did
suspend
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
general
hammer,
would
it
be
true
that
the
decision
of
the
appellate
division
of
the
new
york
supreme
court
was
consistent
with
mr.
justice
powell's
understanding
of
new
york
law
or
suggested
understanding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
be
your
view
even
if
the
appellate
division
decision
had
been
by
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
the
appellate
division.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
but
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
the
opinion
itself
doesn't
hold
what
counsel
said
it
holds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
correct.
