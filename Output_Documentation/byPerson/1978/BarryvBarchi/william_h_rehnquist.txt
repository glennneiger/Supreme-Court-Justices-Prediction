justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sometimes
you
see
the
inquiry
sign
go
up
on
the
tote
board,
you
know
and
then
it
stays
on
for
about
20
minutes
or
half
an
hour
and
then
it's
replaced
by
an
official
sign
and
they
put
up
the
odds.
what's
the
--
do
they
have
that
at
monticello?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hammer,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
we
do
have
a
problem
of
new
york
law
here
that
reading
this
language
that
some
of
my
brother
have
questioned
you
about
pending
such
hearing
and
final
determination
there
on
the
action
the
commission
refusing
to
grant
or
evoking
or
suspending
a
license
or
on
imposing
a
bunch
of
many
full
force
and
effect
seems
kind
of
incongruous
with
the
commission's
initial
determination.
is
it
possible
that
pending
since
is
directed
to
the
courts
of
new
york
rather
than
to
the
commission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
tafas
didn't
deal
with
8022,
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
pullman
issue
is
before
us
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
he
took
a
polygraph
exam.
what
questions
relevant
to
this
inquire
did
he
or
was
he
asked
and
then
did
he
answer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
commission
believed
him
as
to
all
those
answers,
would
that
make
rule
4120.6
the
trainer's
responsibility
rule
inapplicable
to
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
district
court
which
generally
ruled
in
your
favor
say
that
that
was
a
proper
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
want
to
stay,
you're
going
to
have
some
sort
of
hearings
on
the
stay
aren't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
i
mean,
you
say
that
the
invalidity
of
this
rule
in
statute
is
that
it
doesn't
allow
the
commission
to
grant
a
stay
of
the
suspension.
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
stay
should
be
automatic?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
there
are
instances
where
stays
don't
have
to
be
given,
then
there
must
be
some
sort
of
a
hearing
that
the
commission
would
have
to
hold
to
decide
whether
your
clients
is
one
of
those
instances
or
not.
and
inevitably,
you're
going
to
have
a
certain
lapse
of
days
in
there,
are
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
just
say
15
is
too
many.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
have
the
state
courts
responded
to
those
arguments?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
in
the
other
instance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
have
the
result
of
overturning
the
decision
of
the
appellate
division?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
a
construction
of
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
faraldo,
my
home
state
of
arizona
has
a
statute
that
makes
the
registered
owner
of
an
automobile
liable
for
damage
caused
by
anyone
operating
it
unless
it's
actually
stolen
and
you
don't
have
to
show
that
he
loaned
it
to
anybody,
you
don't
have
to
show
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
operation
of
it
or
knowledge
of
it.
do
you
think
that
sort
of
a
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
arizona
is
bombed
by
the
united
states
constitution
the
same
way
new
york
is
and
the
same
way
the
district
court
that
the
same
constitution
that
the
district
court
was
interpreting
in
this
case.
do
you
think
new
york
can't
make
a
trainer
absolutely
liable
for
any
horse
which
he
undertakes
to
train?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
all
that
you
ask
for
here
was
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
then
the
existing
new
york
procedures
were
you
know
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
agree
that
thoroughbred
racing
can
be
distinguished
because
it's
for
the
improvement
of
the
breed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
also
because
the
appellate
division
case
did
not
involve
a
drugged
horse?
