mr.
robert
s.
hammer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
statute
which
provides
for
the
summary
suspension
of
the
occupational
license
of
a
harness
racing
participant
prior
to
any
hearing
on
disciplinary
charges
denies
such
licensee
due
process
or
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
a
statutory
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
held
that
it
indeed
it
did.
we
respectfully
disagree.
we
have
appealed
and
we
asked
this
court
to
reverse.
on
june
22nd
of
1976,
a
horse
named
be
alert
which
was
trained
by
the
plaintiff
run
second
in
a
race
at
monticello
raceway.
prior
to
the
race,
a
blood
test
was
conducted
to
determine
whether
any
drugs
were
in
the
horse's
system.
that
test
was
passed,
however,
subsequent
to
the
race,
a
urine
test
was
conducted
and
traces
of
a
drug
called
lasix
were
found
in
the
horse's
urine.
at
page
6a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
note
5
in
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court,
the
court
pointed
out
that
lasix
is
a
diuretic
and
may
in
fact
enhanced
the
performance
of
the
animal.
under
the
rules
of
the
racing
and
wagering
board,
no
such
drug
may
be
given
to
the
horse
within
48
hours
of
a
race.
as
i
indicated,
this
race
was
conducted
on
june
the
22nd,
two
days
later,
the
post
race
test
results
came
back
and
mr.
barchi,
the
plaintiff
was
called
before
the
stewards.
he
was
given
word
of
this
test
results
and
was
asked
for
an
explanation.
subsequently,
both
at
his
initiative
and
at
the
initiative
of
the
racing
and
wagering
board,
two
separate
polygraph
test
were
taken.
apparently,
the
polygraph
indicated
that
mr.
barchi
was
being
truthful
in
his
statements
and
despite
the
efforts
of
the
board
to
find
out
exactly
what
happened
to
the
horse
an
inconclusive
investigation
in
sued.
on
the
8th
of
july,
the
trainer's
license
was
suspended
on
the
basis
of
what
is
called
the
trainers
responsibility
rule
as
in
the
case
of
a
ship's
captain
who
is
responsible
for
everything
that
goes
on
board,
the
trainer
likewise
is
responsible
for
the
health
and
condition
of
his
horse.
now,
we
had
the
opportunity
as
we
indicated
for
an
informal
conference
at
the
time
he
was
originally
confronted
with
the
results
of
the
test
and
we
suggest
that
this
would
come
within
the
rule
of
goss
against
lopez.
under
the
statute,
section
8022
of
our
unconsolidated
laws,
he
could
have
had
a
full
quasi
judicial
hearing
within
a
few
days,
however,
he
did
not
avail
himself
of
this
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
as
a
result,
this
case
was
brought.
under
section
8022,
a
licensee
is
the
prime
mover
of
any
hearing
conducted
as
a
result
of
disciplinary
action
taken
against
him.
only
he
may
demand
the
hearing
and
he
must
demand
it
within
10
days.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
well,
your
honor,
nothing
can
be
done.
at
that
time,
the
pari-mutuel
pay
off
is
immediate
and
the
results
of
the
race
are
not
affected.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
the
presumption
is
a
rebuttable
presumption
which
relates
only
to
the
trainer.
however,
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
--
if
for
example
it
were
found
that
a
third
party
a
track
tout
or
someone
else's
groom
drug
the
horse
then
of
course
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
yes,
that
would
be
a
standard
part
of
the
tote
board.
i'm
advised
by
my
colleague
mr.
dailey
that
where
in
fact
it
is
determined
that
the
race
was
affected
by
drugging
and
then
it
is
within
the
power
of
the
racing
and
wagering
board
to
take
back
the
purse.
however,
the
pari-mutuel
results
aren't
affected
because
of
the
immediate
pay
off
of
on
the
pari-mutuel
bets.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
yes,
in
fact
i
made
that
point
to
mr.
justice
stevens
that
this
relates
where
in
fact
it
is
found
that
a
third
person
--
a
third
party
or
an
outsider
whether
it
would
be
from
another
owner
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
absolutely,
your
honor.
this
is
a
permissive
presumption
that
it
is
a
rule
of
evidence,
nothing
more.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
no
your
honor,
it
was
not.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
just
prior
to
the
luncheon
recess,
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
about
what
happens
when
a
drug
is
found
to
be
--
a
horse
is
found
to
have
been
drugged
and
i
took
the
opportunity
to
look
up
the
rule
of
the
racing
and
wagering
board
and
its
rule
4120.10
and
it
does
provide
for
a
mandatory
forfeiture
of
the
purse
where
a
horse
has
in
fact
been
drugged
and
the
drugging
could
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
race.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
believe
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
think
we
can
so
assume.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
this
was
not
in
the
case
but
i
would
assume
that
it
was
forfeited.
now
the
statute
in
question
is
section
8022
of
the
new
york
unconsolidated
laws
and
it's
reproduced
at
page
3
of
the
appellant's
brief.
it
provides
that
where
the
stewards
imposed
any
sanction
such
as
a
fine
or
suspension,
the
licensee
may
demand
a
hearing
within
10
days.
thereafter,
the
racing
and
wagering
board
must
schedule
a
prompt
hearing
and
must
render
a
final
decision
within
30
days.
this
administrative
determination
is
reviewable
in
an
action
--
in
a
special
proceeding
under
article
78
of
the
new
york
civil
practice
law
rules
which
would
be
in
the
nature
of
certiorari.
the
statute
provides
that
pending
the
final
determination,
the
suspension
or
revocation
remains
in
effect,
however,
there
is
no
specific
prohibition
upon
the
racing
and
wagering
board
sua
sponte
in
its
own
discretion
granting
a
stay
of
its
own
punishment.
the
statutory
history
of
section
8022
and
the
rest
of
the
racing
laws
is
a
rather
interesting
one
and
we've
set
it
out
at
pages
6
through
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
a
15-day
suspension
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
all,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
absolutely
not.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
the
statute
grants
the
board
up
to
30
days
to
render
its
decision.
what
happens
in
practice
in
cases
of
this
kind
is
that
the
process
is
accelerated
to
a
much
greater
degree.
in
this
instance
and
there
is
a
companion
case
daniel
which
we
refer
to,
he
was
offered
a
hearing
within
two
days
and
turned
it
down.
the
plaintiff
here
never
even
requested
a
hearing.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
it
is
our
position
your
honor
that
although
the
statute
itself
is
somewhat
unclear
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
what
it
says,
however,
in
practice
and
there
was
an
offer
of
proof
on
the
record,
your
honor,
which
the
district
court
did
not
see
fit
to
take
us
up
on.
we
were
prepared
to
show
and
it
is
contained
in
part
in
the
affidavit
of
john
dailey
who
at
that
time
was
chief
counsel
to
the
racing
and
wagering
board
that
in
practice,
the
board
does
in
a
proper
case
stay
its
own
action.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
well,
in
harness
racing,
this
doesn't
work
that
way.
the
sanction
is
imposed
initially
by
the
state
steward.
at
that
point,
the
licensee
has
the
right
within
10
days
to
demand
the
hearing.
the
statutory
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
true.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
anomalous
as
it
sounds
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
it
appears
in
the
record
in
the
affidavit
of
john
dailey
which
appears
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
as
well
as
in
--
yes
and
also
on
the
record,
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
let's
put
it
this
way
that
the
statute
is
construed
administratively
to
in
such
a
way
as
to
achieve
substantial
justice
in
meritorious
cases.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
take
further
answer
your
honest
mr.
justice
white
at
page
20
of
our
brief,
we
cited
mr.
dailey's
affidavit.
page
34a
of
the
appendix,
reference
was
also
made
at
page
28a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
as
well
and
we
made
the
offer
of
proof
on
pages
27
through
30
of
the
transcript
of
the
argument
before
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
if
it
were
merely
the
fact
--
an
assurance
that
the
present
people
in
office
do
not
enforce
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
think
in
this
case
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
in
this
case
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
except
your
honor
by
the
established
administrative
practice
of
the
agency
which
i
think
had
--
we've
been
given
the
opportunity
we
could
have
proven
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that
as
a
matter
of
well-established
administrative
interpretation
stays
was
indeed
granted.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
as
a
matter
of
--
in
the
discretion
of
the
board.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
when
i
--
your
honor
apply
to
this
court
for
stays
of
lower
court
judgments
and
your
honor
as
circuit
justice
has
to
exercise
discretion.
your
honor
has
the
power
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
what
i'm
saying
--
no.
what
i'm
suggesting
your
honor
is
that
in
your
capacity
as
circuit
justice,
you
have
the
discretionary
authority
to
grant
me
a
stay.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
not
ignore
it
your
honor,
interpret
it.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
well,
statutes
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
well,
i
can
only
suggest
your
honor
that
the
record
as
established
below
indicates
that
we
offer
to
prove
this
is
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
it
is
a
conceivably
a
possible
interpretation
of
the
statute.
there
has
--
simply
has
been
relatively
little
case
law
on
this
point.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
the
track
--
the
track
judges
are
the
state
stewards
who
make
the
initial
determination.
what
the
statute
is
referring
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
no.
the
statute
refers
to
the
determination
of
the
commission
after
a
hearing.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
think
that
indeed
resolves
the
problem.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
we
have
the
tafas
case
which
was
referred
to
in
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
district
court.
the
tafas
involved
merely
a
fine.
it
did
not
involve
a
suspension.
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
right.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
we
have
not
entirely
abandoned
it.
it
was
felt
after
some
review
and
discussion
within
the
office
that
perhaps
the
abstention
argument
was
not
quite
as
strong
as
we
initially
thought
it
was.
i
think
abstention
--
my
personal
view
is
that
perhaps
abstention
might
indeed
be
appropriate.
i
don't
think
tafas
which
was
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
opinion
really
addressed
itself
to
the
issue
at
hand.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
tafas
was
a
harness
licensee
and
i
think
tafas
in
fact
did
deal
with
8022.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
think
the
issue
remains
before
your
honors.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
well,
it
was
raised
on
the
jurisdictional
statement.
i
don't
think
it's
the
most
important
issue
in
the
case.
i
think
arguably
it
is
a
position
that
your
honor
might
find
appropriate.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
don't
press
it
vigorously
but
i
do
believe
it
is
in
the
case.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
well,
i
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
think
frankly,
your
honor,
insofar
as
following
it
up.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
the
cases
on
point
pullman,
carey
against
sugar
layout
a
very
simple
and
rather
straightforward
rule
of
law.
i
don't
think
i
could
have
added
anything
to
it.
what
i
think
is
terribly
important
here
really
is
the
cornerstone
of
our
argument
is
the
fact
that
the
astringent
racing
laws
that
prevail
in
new
york
were
adopted
after
a
legislative
finding
based
upon
its
investigation
and
upon
a
governor's
(inaudible)
investigation
which
demonstrated
a
need
for
the
strictest
kind
of
policing
in
supervision.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
until
1940,
there
was
no
pari-mutuel
betting
on
harness
races.
it
was
a
county
fare
pastime.
1940
pari-mutuel
betting
was
legalized
and
within
less
than
15
years,
the
criminals
had
moved
in,
the
labor
rocketeers
had
moved
in.
there
were
cases
of
kickbacks,
there
were
number
of
homicides
and
in
order
to
police
the
sport,
in
order
to
preserve
public
confidence
in
the
sport,
the
legislature
have
to
act
and
one
of
the
ways
in
which
they
acted
was
to
crackdown
hard,
to
impose
what
to
some
may
seem
even
a
draconian
form
of
regulation.
but
we
think
it's
justified
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
common
occupations
or
professions.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
license
of
a
plumber.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
situation
where
--
we
don't
take
pari-mutuel
bets
on
the
outcome
of
surgery
or
whether
--
or
the
size
of
my
colleagues
next
verdict
but
we
do
take
bets
on
horses.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
would
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
state
interest
is
in
taking
a
probably
--
a
licensee
was
probably
misconducted
himself
off
the
track
is
of
equal
constitutional
value
and
dimension
here.
i
think
your
analogy
is
quite
apt.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
well,
i
think
your
inquiry
presents
the
proper
analogy.
we
would
go
so
far
although
we
don't
rely
upon
it
entirely.
we
would
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
the
plurality
of
this
court
--
the
plurality
opinion
of
this
court
in
our
arnett
against
kennedy
provides
a
proper
framework.
racing
--
pari-mutuel
racing
is
an
activity
which
would
have
been
illegal
but
for
legislative
sanction.
the
licensee
didn't
have
to
become
a
harness
trainer.
he
could
have
been
a
shoe
salesman
but
he
chose
to
be
a
harness
trainer
and
he
takes
the
limitations
of
his
license
when
he
applies
for
it.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
the
steward
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
the
steward
suspended
the
license
under
the
racing
regulations
that
is
found
in
title
ix
of
the
new
york
codes,
rules
and
regulations
which
is
the
state
analog
to
the
cfr

it's
reprinted
and

wagering

mr.
robert

the
steward
is
the
agent
of
the
board.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
right.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct
because
--
mr.
robert

the
harness
racing
commission
was
subsumed
under
the
state
racing
--
mr.
robert

it
was
issued
by

authorized
agent
of
the
commission
subject
to
review
at
the
request
of
the
licensee
by
the
full
commission
or
full
board.
mr.

the
suspension
was
authorized

it
was
for
violation
of
sections
4116.11,
4120.05
and
4120.6
of
the
rules
of
harness
racing
and

of
the
racing
rules
which
authorized
suspension
for
violation
of
these
other
rules.
i
think
that
this
is
not
contested.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
this
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
steward.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
it
refers
to
the
judges
of
the
--
who
have
been
appointed
by
the
racing
and
wagering
board.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
no
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
we
contend
that
this
is
a
rule
which
is
enforced
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that
while
the
trainer's
responsibility
rules
are
rules
of
law
in
practice
and
this
was
our
intention
before
the
three-judge
court
which
appears
in
the
transcript
which
is
filed
with
your
honors
that
the
stewards
nevertheless
have
discretion
in
enforcing
it.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
the
record
does
not
so
show.
it's
something
that
would
had
a
hearing
been
held
and
if
the
plaintiff
had
indeed
requested
a
hearing,
it
could
have
been
developed
at
that
hearing.
i
think
what's
important
here
is
to
remember
that
even
though
there
is
some
possible
element
of
a
reparable
injury
and
we
don't
deny
it.
how
much
injury
through
loss
of
earnings
we
can
of
course
not
tell,
not
with
any
accuracy
speculative
but
this
court
in
its
decisions
in
the
bob
jones
case
and
the
enochs
case
which
we
cite
has
laid
down
a
rule
that
even
where
a
reparable
injury
even
total
destruction
of
the
enterprise
may
result.
you
can
establish
a
law
here,
in
that
case
for
mere
administrative
convenience,
which
would
preclude
pre-hearing
stays
or
pre-hearing
injunctions
against
a
determination?
i
just
want
to
touch
briefly
upon
the
equal
protection
question.
it's
our
position
that
it
should
not
even
have
been
decided
by
the
district
court
since
they'd
already
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
other
grounds.
this
was
a
matter
of
constitutional
overkill
as
it
were.
it
was
unnecessary
under
the
rule
of
peters
against
harvey.
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief,
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
the
statute
in
terms
of
its
statutory
history.
on
the
other
hand,
in
practice,
the
--
both
harness
and
thoroughbred
trainers
are
treated
alike.
in
a
section
of
the
thoroughbred
rules,
the
thoroughbred
licensees
are
treated
in
the
same
way
and
that
all
penalties
as
the
section
4013.13
under
the
rules
all
penalties
imposed
by
the
stewards
remain
in
effect
pending
judicial
or
administrative
review.
if
the
court
please,
i'll
simply
reserve
the
last
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
would
disagree
with
that
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
believe
you
have
stated
counsel's
position
correctly
but
i
believe
he
has
misconstrued
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
did.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
simply
dismissed
an
appeal
and
later
denied
leave
to
appeal
on
procedural
grounds.
this
was
a
decision
of
an
intermediate
appellate
court.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
were
on
purely
procedural
grounds
unrelated
to
the
substance
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
all
you
have
are
single
orders
without
any
opinion
whatever.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
as
a
matter
of
new
york
jurisprudence,
any
new
york
lawyer
would
understand
this
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
think
it
would
be
clear
from
the
examination
of
the
new
york
statutes.
it
would
be
article
56
of
the
new
york
civil
practice
law
and
rules
relating
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
i
think
cohen
and
karger
powers
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
which
is
somewhat
dated
but
it
is
the
definitive
treaties
would
also
make
this
clear
that
just
as
a
denial
of
certiorari
is
not
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
no
sir.
i
would
have
to
disagree
because
in
our
view,
a
drugged
horse
situation
would
automatically
qualify
as
a
ground
for
summary
suspension
of
a
licensee.
even
if
indeed
the
new
york
state
administrative
procedure
act
applies
and
i
think
there
is
still
a
substantial
question
whether
it's
a
matter
of
new
york
law
whether
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
apply
to
this
case
notwithstanding
gerard.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
well,
if
the
court
of
appeals
--
if
it
had
been
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
is
the
last
word
on
new
york
law
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
--
but
this
was
not.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
the
opinion
counsel
is
correct
in
his
summarization
of
what
the
appellate
division
held
but
this
is
not
we
submit
what
new
york
law
is
or
should
be
and
this
will
have
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
in
this
case,
the
appellate
division
involved
the
so-called
the
gerstein
case
switching
where
the
veterinarian
was
ultimately
convicted
on
some
violations
and
in
fact
sentenced
to
prison
for
a
year.
i
would
simply
say
that
counsel
in
his
presentation
has
alluded
toward
many
things
which
are
to
hold
the
record
or
which
really
raise
the
questions
of
fact.
this
we
feel
as
we
had
urged
the
three-judge
court
should
have
held
further
hearings.
yes,
there
is
a
reparable
injury
perhaps
when
a
trainer
is
summarily
suspended
but
we
would
submit
your
honors
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
more
important
the
rationale
of
these
decisions
uphold
such
a
suspension
as
a
matter
of
due
process
and
we
would
accordingly
urge
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
