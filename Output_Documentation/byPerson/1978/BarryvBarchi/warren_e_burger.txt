chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
803,
barry
against
barchi.
mr.
hammer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
may
have
been
overbroad.
at
least
i
should
think
you
were
in
responding
to
mr.
justice
stevens.
if
it
was
demonstrated
affirmatively
that
the
owner
and
not
the
trainer
had
drugged
the
horse
and
that
the
owner
had
done
this
without
the
trainer's
knowledge
then
surely,
the
trainer
would
not
be
punished,
would
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
is
a
presumption
to
get
the
matter
started
and
that
can
be
rebutted
by
other
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
at
one
o'clock.
you
may
resume,
mr.
hammer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
your
administrative
proceedings.
if
he
had
requested
a
hearing,
he
could
have
asked
for
and
could
have
received
a
stay
of
the
suspension
until
the
decision
was
made.
is
that
right?
is
that
what
you
were
talking?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
in
the
operative
of
proof?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
this
is
analogous
to
the
summary
proceedings
that
are
sometimes
employed
to
take
a
dangerous
drug
off
the
market
or
a
medicine
or
food
stuff
when
it's
discovered
that
it
is
dangerous
that
there
is
a
summary
suspension
and
then
a
hearing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
not
making
an
analogy.
i
was
inquiring
about
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright,
very
well.
mr.
faraldo.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
ask
for
it
in
an
administrative
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
ask
for
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
you
can't
complain
about
not
getting
it,
can
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
going
into
an
administrative
hearing,
you
would
have
been
able
to
challenge
that
right
away,
would
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
say
that
various
--
very
rapidly
that
how
are
we
to
know
now
but
if
you
would
ask
for
the
administrative
hearing
that
the
statute
provides
for
that
you
might
not
had
your
man
cleared
then
there
never
would
have
been
any
lawsuit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
what
that
has
to
do
with
this
case
but
let
me
ask
you
another
question,
neither
of
you
as
far
as
i
observe
have
cited
the
case
of
securities
and
exchange
commission
against
sloan
which
was
decided
in
this
court
in
may
of
this
year.
there,
the
federal
statute
in
the
securities
act
authorized
a
10-day
suspension
summary
proceeding
for
a
violation
of
certain
trading
provisions
and
how
would
you
distinguish
what
new
york
does
here
to
--
in
the
racing
area
from
the
securities
suspension
procedure
of
10
days.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
suspended
from
training
for
10
days,
that's
quite
of
a
loss
tp
him,
isn't
it,
in
the
stock
market?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
10
--
10
days?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
really
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
you're
really
arguing
is
that
there
can't
be
any
suspension
by
a
summary
process.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
can't
review
--
we
are
not
here
to
review
the
medical
question
counsel.
i'm
sure
you
know
that.
this
regulation
is
presumptively
valid
and
we
have
to
assume
that
it
was
based
on
some
medical
veterinarian's
advice.
so
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
you
have
just
about
one
minute
left
mr.
hammer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
--
