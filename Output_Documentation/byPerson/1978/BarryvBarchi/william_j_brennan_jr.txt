justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
language
is
rather
explicit
isn't
it
that
pending
such
hearing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
action
suspending
a
license
shall
remain
in
full
force
and
effect
and
you
said
that
doesn't
mean
what
it
says.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
does
that
appear
other
than
you're
telling
us
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
you
don't
argue
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
you
don't
press
at
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
it's
not
printed
anywhere
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
faraldo,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
clear
about
this
change
in
the
new
york
procedure,
what
do
you
call
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what's
the
effect
of
that
--
does
that
mean
in
the
future,
8022
suspensions
must
be
proceeded
by
a
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
help
me
out
this
way,
suppose
that
law
--
that
moment
have
been
in
effect
when
all
these
happened,
what
would
mr.
barchi
have
gotten?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
would
that
have
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
context
of
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
have
been
before
--
there
was
an
18-day
period
of
investigation
before
the
suspension,
wasn't
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
and
what
would
have
happened
if
that
amendment
had
been
in
effect
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
some
time
in
that
18-day
period
i
take
it
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
there
was
any
suspension?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
would
have
been
a
full
judicatory
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
finding
based
on
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
finding
that
i
gather,
the
commission
could
make
without
giving
you
any
hearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
there
are
some
suggestions
though
that
has
been
corruption
around
harness
racing
that
is
not
been
through
of
thoroughbred
racing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
statutes
did
develop
separately,
didn't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
the
equal
protection
doesn't
demand
identity,
does
it
all
the
way
through.
it
didn't
have
some
mile
differences?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
a
little
curiuos.
does
illinois
have
similar
provisions
with
respect
to
the
client?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
the
racing
that
declined.
is
it
the
hambletonian?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
asking.
do
you
know
whether
illinois
have
statutes
or
regulations
similar
to
those
of
new
york?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
that
your
new
york
trainers
go
to
illinois
for
the
hambletonian.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
us?
