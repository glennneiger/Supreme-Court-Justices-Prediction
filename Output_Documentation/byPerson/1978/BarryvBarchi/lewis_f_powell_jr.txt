justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
before
you
start.
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
gerard.
you
mentioned
it
and
your
opponent
also
mentioned
it.
i
understand
that
your
opponent
takes
the
view
that
gerard
has
held
in
effect
that
section
401(3)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
amended
1976
and
as
construed
by
the
court
in
gerard
qualifies
8022
so
that
the
law
in
new
york
--
state
law
in
new
york
is
now
in
agreement
with
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
have
i
stated
his
position
correctly?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
appellate
division.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
did
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
say?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
opinion
make
that
clear?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
does
the
order
make
that
clear?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
because
the
appellate
division
is
not
the
court
a
last
resort.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
it
is
the
court,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
spoke
into
this
issue
of
state
law.
