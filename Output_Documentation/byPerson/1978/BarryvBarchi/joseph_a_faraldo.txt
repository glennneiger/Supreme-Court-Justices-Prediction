mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
john
barchi,
the
appellee
in
this
case
and
seek
the
affirmance
of
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court
constitutional
court
below
which
struck
down
new
york
section
8022
of
the
unconsolidated
laws
as
unconstitutional
both
as
the
deprivation
of
due
process
of
law
and
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
barchi
had
a
very
substantial
interest
in
continuing
in
his
livelihood
something
which
he
had
built
up
before
a
long
period
of
time.
the
race
that
we
are
talking
about
occurred
on
june
the
22nd
of
1976
and
on
june
the
24th,
mr.
barchi
was
called
to
the
track
steward's
office
and
the
track
steward
as
my
brother
has
stated
is
an
armor
extension
or
agent
of
the
commission
itself,
the
actions
of
that
judge
and
the
actions
of
the
commission
for
all
in
terms
and
purposes
the
same.
on
the
24th
he
was
called
into
the
office
and
informed
by
the
judge
that
he
had
have
a
positive
lasix,
in
other
words,
lasix,
a
foreign
substance
was
found
in
the
horse's
urine.
he
denied
any
knowledge
or
participation
in
the
event.
the
next
contact
that
we
had
in
this
case
was
on
or
about
the
27th
day
of
june
when
we
were
requested
to
take
a
polygraph
exam.
we
did
take
a
polygraph
exam.
i
believe
it
was
on
the
29th
day
of
june.
my
client
voluntarily
took
a
polygraph
exam
in
order
to
profess
his
innocence
which
he
had
professed
from
the
very
beginning.
he
passed
the
polygraph
exam
that
was
given
privately
and
on
the
following
day
at
the
request
of
the
new
york
state
racing
and
wagering
board,
he
took
and
passed
the
second
polygraph
exam.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
i
believe
that
they
are
part
of
the
appendix
in
this
case
--
he
was
asked
to
whether
or
not
he
had
given
lasix
to
this
horse.
whether
or
not
he
had
directed
anyone
to
give
lasix
to
this
horse,
whether
or
not
he
knew
if
anyone
indeed
had
given
lasix
to
this
horse
or
if
he
knew
any
of
the
circumstances
how
this
prohibited
substance
got
into
this
particular
horse.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
the
way
it
has
been
interpreted
by
the
new
york
state
racing
and
wagering
board
and
some
of
the
jurisdictions
around
the
nation,
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
it
has
been
my
experience
that
this
has
been
interpreted
as
an
absolute
rule
of
liability
--
and
some
of
the
jurisdictions,
not
all.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
they
said
that
it
was
a
rebuttable
presumption
or
at
least
some
of
them
were
rebuttable.
however,
there
is
a
presumption
in
one
of
the
rules
under
which
my
client
was
suspended
which
says
that
he
administered,
it
shall
be
presumed
that
the
trainer
administered
the
drug
to
the
horse
with
the
intent
to
affect
the
speed
or
outcome
of
a
horse
race.
in
addition,
it
says
that
upon
the
mere
finding
of
the
presence
of
a
drug
in
a
horse's
system,
there
is
a
presumption
that
it
was
given
to
the
horse
within
48
hours
of
his
race.
now,
how
anyone
could
rebut
those
presumptions
behind
me
since
we
have
never
seen
the
sample.
we
were
never
confronted
by
the
sample
that
was
taken
from
the
horse.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
it's
never
given,
your
honor.
the
entire
--
excuse
me.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
no,
we
did
not
ask
for
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
we're
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
were
going
to
suspend
my
client
without
any
type
of
a
hearing
whatsoever
at
that
point
in
time.
they
led
us
to
believe
that
they
were
continuing
some
sort
of
investigation
and
then
in
the
latter
part
of
the
week
we
were
hit
with
the
notice
of
suspension.
we
never
sought
or
were
confronted
with
how
the
sample
was
taken,
what
the
analysis
show.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
at
that
point
in
time,
i
think
the
administrative
remedy
is
meaningless
if
there
is
no
stay
and
while
there
has
been
an
illusion
made
to
this
court
that
they
do
posses
the
discretion
to
grant
a
stay
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
your
honor,
since
i
stop
grooming
horses
and
became
a
lawyer,
i've
never
seen
one
instance
where
a
stay
was
granted
by
this
board.
after
this
case,
this
particular
case
was
argued
before
the
honorable
mr.
justice
goettel
in
the
district
court
seeking
the
convocation
of
a
three-judge
court.
i
had
a
client
suspended
for
15
days.
i
requested
a
stay
in
that
case
that
is
then
your
case
which
my
brother
makes
reference
to,
the
stay
was
refused.
they
did
say
to
me
on
that
occasion,
we
will
give
you
a
prompt
hearing
but
if
there
is
no
stay
and
then
you
all
had
a
15-day
suspension
identical
to
barchi
and
the
question
would
be
moved.
they're
not
providing
my
client
with
an
opportunity
--
for
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
a
meaningful
time
and
that's
all
i
ask
for.
that
was
not
given
to
barchi,
i
agree
we
did
not
asked
and
then
when
we
did
asked
two
days
after
argument
on
barchi,
we
were
flatly
refused
again.
i
have
represented
a
number
of
harness
horse
trainers.
in
the
record
before
this
court
in
may
of
1976,
five
trainers
were
suspended
up
at
monticello
on
the
same
facts.
proof
of
the
presence
of
a
drug
in
the
system
is
a
suspension
to
the
trainer.
now,
they
hold
out
a
writ
of
justice
by
saying
to
us,
come,
file
your
notice
of
appeal
within
10
days
and
we
shall
promptly
schedule
you
a
hearing.?
that
has
never
happened.
none
of
the
five
trainers
of
monticello
raceway
suspended
in
may
of
1976
and
not
a
single
solitary
one
of
them
avail
themselves
of
the
so-called
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard
because
this
is
not
a
meaningful
opportunity.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
not
having
the
case
before
me
your
honor,
it
makes
it
pretty
difficult.
however,
there
is
one
thing
in
barchi
which
is
very
significant
and
that
is
a
irremediable
loss
to
mr.
barchi.
the
fact
that
different
from
the
cases
in
this
court
such
as
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
yes,
i
would
agree
but
this
bears
upon
an
individual's
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
in
the
horse
racing
business
as
soon
as
you
are
suspended
as
the
trainer,
the
owner
automatically
loses
the
purse.
if
the
owner
wishes
to
continue
with
you,
he
is
banned
also
from
racing.
barchi
is
banned
from
racing
all
throughout
the
united
states
of
america.
he
cannot
earn
his
livelihood
anywhere.
all
of
the
owners
that
he
has
accumulated
over
a
course
of
years
as
a
result
of
his
own
expertise
in
this
area
are
gone.
he
is
stigmatized
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
excuse
me.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
i
would
agree
with
that
if
the
hearing
were
meaningful.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
but
your
honor,
if
he
did
ask
for
the
hearing
without
a
provision
for
a
stay
given
to
harness
racing
licensees
while
there
is
one
given
to
thoroughbred
racing
licensees,
then
the
hearing
is
meaningless
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
that
is
correct
but
during
that
period
of
time,
your
honor,
these
horses
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
yes
he
is
but
during
the
15
days,
he
loses
all
the
owners
whose
horses
have
to
race
during
that
15-day
period
because
so
long
as
they
employ
him
as
trainer,
their
horses
will
not
race
so
he
cannot
earn
a
portion
of
the
purse
which
the
trainer
gets
and
once
those
horses
are
given
to
another
trainer,
it
would
be
like
an
attorney
suspended
from
the
practice
of
law.
he
is
not
going
to
hold
on
to
his
clients
during
the
interim.
if
it's
in
the
middle
of
a
trial,
he
has
to
get
himself
another
attorney.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
a
hearing
on
the
issue
of
the
stay?
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
i'm
saying
that
parallel
to
section
401
of
the
state
administrative
procedure
act
that
there
certainly
are
instances
where
stays
do
not
have
to
be
given
in
emergency
situation.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
yeah,
i
would
believe
so,
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
15
of
course
is
an
irremediable
loss
to
the
trainer.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
10
days
will
probably
work
--
10
days
would
probably
not
work
as
great
a
detriment
but
it
would
come
very
close
because
these
horses
race
once
a
week.
so
if
you
lose,
15
days,
you're
losing
two
weeks
or
racing.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
--
your
honors
will
not
tolerate
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
i'm
arguing
that
from
the
decision
in
this
case
below
and
from
the
due
process
decisions
of
this
court
before
where
there
is
no
ability
for
retroactive
payments
where
there
is
not
something
that
can
be
restored
by
a
post-termination
hearing.
i
think
that
due
process
would
require
some
kind
of
hearing.
what
was
given
to
my
client
was
absolutely
no
hearing.
i've
heard
my
brother
refer
to
it
as
a
conference
type
informal
hearing
but
we
were
not
given
at
that
stage
if
we
had
--
if
that
is
indeed
what
that
was
any
evidence
of
the
positive.
we
still
don't
know
whether
or
not
this
horse
had
the
substance
they
claim
in
its
system.
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
and
if
we
had
been
given
some
kind
of
hearing
maybe
we
could
at
least
establish
that
fact.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
yeah,
i
think
there
would
be
a
question
of
probable
cause
to
believe
sir
at
the
very
minimum,
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
i
think
at
the
very
minimum
but
i
think
that
in
view
of
the
type
of
injury
that
is
caused
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
yes
but
under
the
presumptions
if
the
court
accepts
the
presumptions
as
a
rebuttable
presumptions
then
the
probably
cause
that
something
was
found
in
the
same
would
end
the
entire
case.
innocence
or
guilt
of
the
party
would
not
be
relevant
at
that
junction.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
under
the
terms
of
the
rule
as
interpreted
by
new
york
and
some
other
jurisdictions,
he
would
be
suspended
no
matter
where
he
was,
no
matter
what
he
had
to
do
with
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
so
long
as
--
yes,
he
could
show
that
at
a
hearing
but
so
long
as
he
was
the
trainer
of
the
horse
he
again
would
be
suspended
under
the
interpretation
of
this
statute.
now,
my
brother
has
argued
that
as
a
matter
of
cause,
these
stays
are
given
to
trainers
and
the
board
has
the
power
in
its
discretion
to
grant
stays.
i
think
that
was
in
the
response
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
the
cases
that
i
have
had
with
this
board,
they
have
argued
vigorously
before
state
courts
that
the
statute
absolutely
prohibited
their
granting
a
stay
under
any
circumstances.
they
have
also
argued
to
the
courts
of
our
state
that
the
statute
prohibited
the
courts
from
issuing
a
stay.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
in
some
instances,
the
state
courts
have
gone
along
with
the
argument
of
the
new
york
state
racing
and
wagering
board
and
refuse
to
grant
any
stays.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
in
the
instances
of
thoroughbred
racing,
the
stays
are
commonly
granted
in
new
york.
and
section
401
of
the
state
administrative
procedure
act
which
became
effective
after
this
case
says
that
summary
suspensions
are
allowed
in
instances
where
there
is
a
finding
made
that
an
emergency
exists
or
that
the
health
welfare
of
society
commands
a
summary
suspension.
so
what
we
have
been
given
in
barchi
by
the
three-judge
court
below
has
now
been
codified
in
our
state
law.
my
brother
makes
reference
to
a
case,
gerard
v.
barry
which
applied
section
401
to
another
racing
incident.
that
case,
he
notes
in
his
brief
was
an
application
by
the
appellate
division
of
that
section
to
this
horse
racing
industry
which
was
erroneous
and
he
points
to
the
fact
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
an
appeal
pending
in
that
case
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
they
have
dismissed
the
application
of
the
attorney
general
in
that
court
to
construe
that
statute
otherwise.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
no,
the
appellate
division
which
went
in
the
same
vane
as
barchi
and
the
three-judge
court
below
was
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
on
the
dismissal
of
this
appeal
of
gerard
v.
barry.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
that
was
a
construction
of
a
statute
which
has
come
into
existence
paralleling
the
decision
of
barchi,
section
401(3)
of
the
state
administrative
procedure
act.
and
that
has
been
given
the
official
imprimatur
or
our
courts,
our
highest
courts,
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
excuse
me?
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
no,
the
statute
has
not
been
changed
by
the
new
york
state
legislature.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
but
section
401
of
the
state
administrative
procedure
act
which
gives
the
same
kind
of
guarantees
that
the
three-judge
constitutional
court
gave
to
these
licensees
has
now
been
the
law
and
has
now
been
made
the
law
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
i
believe
that
in
each
situation
where
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
i
think
that
you
have
made
one
assumption
in
your
statement
and
that
is
if
the
trainer
had
control
of
the
horse.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
had
the
trainer
the
exclusive
care
custody
in
control
of
the
horse,
i
have
no
objection
for
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
by
legislative
field,
i
don't
think
that
they
could
deprive
him
of
his
constitutional
rights.
in
other
words,
if
they
establish
such
a
presumption
or
enacted
such
a
statement
of
strict
liability,
they
still
would
have
to
show
some
control.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
yes,
i
believe
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
yes
it
does
but
i
think
that
the
section
that
the
court
below
was
taking
into
consideration
was
the
one
that
says
that
the
trainer
is
responsibility
and
must
guide
and
care
for
his
horse.
upon
oral
argument
when
i
was
asked
if
that
were
rebuttable,
i
myself
agreed
that
that
rebuttable
presumption
but
the
presumptions
that
the
drug
just
finding
a
foreign
substance
in
the
horse's
urine
was
administered,
raises
a
presumption
that
it
was
administered
within
48
hours
of
a
race.
i
find
no
rational
connection
with
that
on
the
mere
fact
of
the
finding
of
foreign
substance
in
the
horse's
urine.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
i
think
that
that
has
been
--
i
think
that
that
has
dictated
to
us
by
insurance
considerations
and
other
considerations.
it
doesn't
become
then
a
taking
from
that
individual
per
se
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
--
unless
arizona
has
something
other
than
mandatory
insurance.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
no,
i
do
not
because
i
do
not
see
a
rational
connection
with
the
fact
of
his
control.
all
of
these
statutes
are
strict
liability
in
my
opinion
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
person
who
is
held
liable
or
responsible
has
the
control
or
has
the
control
of
the
thing
which
caused
the
injury
in
a
particular
case.
now,
it
maybe
a
little
more
remote
in
the
case
of
an
automobile
but
in
the
case
of
a
harness
racing
trainer
or
any
trainer
of
horses,
the
facts
shows
that
many
people
have
access,
many
people
have
control,
many
people
for
whatever
reasons
can
in
some
way
get
some
substance
to
a
horse.
if
a
trainer
slept
with
his
horse
for
24
hours
a
day
the
dissent
in
sandstrom
versus
california
which
was
a
california
supreme
court
decision.
if
he
slept
with
his
horse
24
hours
a
day,
i
could
see
a
rational
basis
to
do
it
but
it's
not
within
human
experience
to
do
such
a
thing.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
i
think
that
the
state
of
the
scientific
art
in
the
horse
racing
and
chemistry
is
sufficient
enough
to
place
the
time
of
administration
within
fixed
parameters.
i
believe
that
within
those
fixed
parameters,
a
trainer
who
generally
is
at
or
in
attendance
of
his
horse
during
certain
periods
of
time
can
be
held
liable
upon
proof
of
administration
during
the
period
of
time
when
he
generally
is
about
and
has
control
of
the
horse.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
no,
i
think
that
on
that
basis,
you
would
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
no.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
i
think
what
you
would
have
to
prove
is
that
the
drug
was
apparently
administered
during
a
period
of
time
when
he
had
control
and/or
custody
of
the
horse.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
no
but
the
assumption
as
far
as
questions
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
the
presumption
so
far
as
it
puts
the
liability
from
the
mere
finding
of
the
substance
in
the
horse's
urine
i
think
is
part
of
the
case.
as
a
result
of
the
inquiry
by
mr.
justice
white
as
to
whether
or
not
a
probable
cause
hearing
would
suffice.
i
think
since
the
state
of
new
york
has
established
procedures
to
give
a
fully
judicatory
proceeding
although
not
a
meaningful
time
that
there
is
no
additional
course
or
expense
of
burden
to
the
state
of
new
york.
in
this
particular
case,
they
let
18
days
go
by
while
they
spouse
in
this
court,
the
need
for
summary
action.
for
18
days,
there
was
no
action
taken
by
this
commission
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
and
as
far
as
i
know,
they
did
absolutely
nothing.
so
far
as
i
know,
they
asked
us
if
we're
to
take
a
polygraph
exam
and
as
customary
in
racing
commissions
that
if
a
person
should
fail
a
polygraph
exam,
they
will
hold
him
responsible
and
if
he
does
pass
a
polygraph
exam,
they
will
discard
the
results.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
they
said
we
pass
the
exam
and
if
they
knew
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
they
insisted
on
suspending
us
anyway.
they
alleged
the
need
to
protect
the
public.
i
don't
see
how
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
in
the
affidavit
of
mr.
dailey
which
has
been
alluded
to
before,
there
is
a
statement
that
when
it
was
not
able
to
be
determined
who
was
responsible
for
this
incident,
mr.
barchi
was
suspended
under
the
basis
of
the
trainers
responsibility
role.
i
think
that's
pretty
much
a
fair
quote
of
his
statement.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
the
state
administrative
procedure
act
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
what
--
yes
sir
that
is
an
essence
to
what
it
means.
it
means
that
unless
there
is
a
finding
that
the
public
welfare
or
safety
is
in
jeopardy
by
continuing
this
licensee
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
mr.
barchi
would
have
got
a
full
judicatory
hearing
prior
to
the
taking.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
that
would
have
been
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
i
don't
quite
understand.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
mr.
barchi
would
have
been
given
notice
of
charges
and
an
opportunity
to
respond
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
that
is
correct
as
which
is
now
provided
for
now
but
only
post
termination.
it
would
have
been
pre-termination.
that
is
the
effect
of
that
statute.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
unless
they
make
a
finding
that
the
public
welfare
safety
or
health
is
in
jeopardy
by
continuing
the
license
of
that
individual.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
that
is
a
question
that
has
not
been
answered
by
the
new
york
state
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
if
they
could
substantiate
that
then
in
a
court
action
for
a
violation
under
section
401(3)
of
the
state
administrative
procedure
law,
i
would
agree
with
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
on
the
grounds
of
due
process
and
on
the
grounds
of
violating
the
equal
protection
of
law
and
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
issue.
the
thoroughbred
statute
or
the
statute
that
governs
thoroughbred
racing
is
new
york
unconsolidated
law
7915.
it
is
identical
to
the
language
of
section
8022
but
in
7915,
one
very
serious
sentence
is
left
out
and
that
is
pending
a
full
review
by
the
commission.
the
action
of
the
judges
or
the
agents
of
the
commission
shall
remain
in
full
force
and
effect.
that
section
is
completely
omitted
from
that
which
governs
thoroughbred
racing
in
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
while
the
attorney
general
argues
that
they
need
the
summary
power
while
they
waited
18
days
in
this
case,
the
parallel
section
governing
thoroughbred
racing
to
which
the
state
should
have
the
same
interest
does
not
contain
the
statutory
prohibition
and
on
that
basis
in
the
equal
protection
argument
was
made
on
the
grounds
that
it
denied
equal
protection
of
law
to
people
engaged
in
the
harness
racing.
it's
the
same
industry.
the
only
difference
is
one
man
sits
behind
the
horse
and
other
sits
the
top.
it's
gambling,
it's
pari-mutuel
wagering,
it's
everything
that
is
involved
in
thoroughbred
racing.
to
take
one
class
of
thoroughbred
racing
personnel
and
give
them
just
about
the
rights
that
i
feel
are
guaranteed
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
take
another
group
in
the
same
industry
with
all
the
same
considerations
and
the
same
ramifications
and
say
that
they
should
not
be
given
due
process
of
law.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
the
statement
made
by
the
attorney
general
is
that
in
1954,
there
were
some
labor
union
disruptions
or
activities
at
yonkers
raceway
i
believe
it
was
or
in
harness
racing
in
the
state
of
new
york.
what
does
has
to
do
with
trainers
and
owners
who
participated
out
the
race
track
itself
i
cannot
understand
if
it
had
some
rational
relationship
if
as
they
say
harness
racing
were
more
corrupt
than
thoroughbred
racing
then
i
could
see
a
need
for
some
more
severe
modes
of
procedure
vis-à-vis
harness
racing
licensees
but
i
don't
see
a
rational
connection
between
what
is
asserted
to
be
labor
union
activities
in
the
1950s
and
the
denial
of
a
hearing
to
a
harness
racing
trainer.
i
cannot
make
that
connection.
i
believe
that
the
equal
protection
argument
is
a
substantial
argument
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
yes
they
did
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
state
investigation
commission
in
june
of
1976
noted
that
there
were
procedural
differences
which
did
not
have
any
rational
basis
and
that
once
the
state
racing
and
wagering
board
was
consolidated,
in
other
words,
once
the
harness
racing
commission
and
thoroughbred
commission
were
brought
under
one
roof
that
the
new
york
state
racing
and
wagering
board
ought
to
work
to
alleviate
those
reference
where
they
appear
but
there
is
no
factual,
there
is
no
factual
basis
for
treating
the
harness
racing
personnel
different
than
thoroughbred
racing
personnel.
and
i
think
the
equal
protection
argument
is
very
substantial
here.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
yes,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
no.
i'm
sorry
i
cannot.
i've
been
involved
in
harness
racing
too
long
to
think
that
there
are
any
real
differences
between
licensees
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
excuse
me,
breakdown
the
inference
that
harness
racing
horses
are
not
thoroughbreds?
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
they
are
not
thoroughbreds.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
they
are
different
breed
altogether.
they
were
developed
in
this
country
to
do
work.
they
were
developed
in
this
country
to
take
people
to
and
from
--
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
in
respect
to
what
sir?
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
the
hambletonian
is
a
du
quoin
and
it's
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
illinois
racing
board.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
well,
they
do
not.
they
have
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
have
struck
down
as
unconstitutional
the
strict
liability
provision
holding
that
in
illinois
versus
--
brennan
versus
illinois
racing
and
wagering
board
in
19
--
i
believe
it's
69
case.
illinois
struck
it
down
saying
that
the
only
thing
that
it
protects
against
is
something
over
which
the
trainer
has
no
opportunity
to
guard
against
anyway
and
has
left
illinois
with
a
rule
based
upon
the
negligence
of
the
trainer
or
his
actual
culpable
conduct.
mr.
joseph
a.
faraldo
yes
we
do.
thank
you.
