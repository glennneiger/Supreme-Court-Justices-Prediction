justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
the
united
states
itself
would
qualify
under
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
what
if
it
were
the
united
states?
so
anybody
--
justice
byron
r.
white
anybody
(voice
overlap)
who
was
displaced
from
any
property
that
the
united
states
or
any
of
its
agencies
owns
is
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
if
you
please.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
understand
the
united
states
position
here
to
be
similar
or
close
to
the
positions
taken
by
the
courts
that
have
held
contrary
to
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
second
circuit,
is
it,
has
the
united
states
always
taken
the
same
position
in
this
various
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
any
of
the
courts
have
held
against
your
position
have
in
the
main
agreed
with
the
united
states
present
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
some
district
courts
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
thank
you.
