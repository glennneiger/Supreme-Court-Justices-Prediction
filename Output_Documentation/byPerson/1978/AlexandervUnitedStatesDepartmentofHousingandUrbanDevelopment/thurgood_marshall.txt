mr.
vanderstar,
you
don't
see
any
connection
between
the
acquisition
and
the
written
order
section?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
entirely
different
in
your
view?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
your
just
on
the
acquisition,
you
don't
need
a
written
order
or
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
therefore
if
you,
on
the
written
order
you
don't
need
the
acquisition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
main
point
that
is
before
us
right
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
why
he
was
so
willing
to
drop
the
acquisition
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
keep
that
when
you're
gone,
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
should
not
--
this
is
not
eminent
domain
case
because
you
are
not
acquiring
this.
you
already
have
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
they
can't
do
it,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask
you
again.
i
thought
originally,
you
told
me
that
the
acquisition
clause
and
the
written
notice
clause
were
separate
animals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
now
you're
saying
they're
the
same.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
that
it
would
probably
was
acquired
in
1950?
if
that
was
acquired,
that's
enough
to
apply
to
a
1977
notice.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
would
be
awful
hard
to
get
any
eminent
domain
20
years
later,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
eminent
domain?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
displacement
at
any
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
don't
need
the
acquisition
in
that
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
he
may
be
talking
about
federal
property
that
it
had
to
be
acquired.
so
why
did
they
get
acquisition
in
that
all
in
legal
theory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
based
on
it,
the
whole
statute
was
based
on
acquisition.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
way
is
not
to
acquire?
justice
thurgood
marshall
these
two
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
district
court
of
columbia
circuit.
at
issue
is
the
scope
of
the
term
displaced
person
which
congress
used
to
define
the
persons
eligible
for
assistance
under
the
uniform
relocation
assistance
and
real
property
acquisition
policies
act
of
1970.
in
both
cases,
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
acquired
housing
projects
because
the
project's
sponsors
had
defaulted
on
federally
insured
loans.
after
managing
the
property
for
a
while
hud
decided
to
close
the
projects
due
to
the
deterioration
of
condition
and
it
evicted
the
tenants.
the
tenants
then
filed
suit
contending
that
they
were
displaced
persons
entitled
to
assistance
under
the
relocation
act
and
particularly
they
relied
on
the
“written
order”
clause
contained
in
the
definition
of
the
term
displaced
person.
the
seventh
circuit
eventually
concluded
that
the
tenants
were
not
eligible
under
this
clause
of
the
definition.
however,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reached
a
contract
--
conclusion
about
the
scope
of
this
written
order
clause.
the
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
written
order
clause
encompasses
only
persons
ordered
to
vacate
the
property
in
connection
with
the
actual
or
proposed
acquisition
of
that
property
for
a
federal
program.
in
essence,
congress
imposed
two
causal
requirements.
first,
the
written
order
to
vacate
must
result
directly
from
an
actual
or
contemplated
property
acquisition.
and
second,
that
acquisition
must
be
for
or
intended
to
further
a
federal
program
or
project.
we
conclude
that
the
tenants
here
have
not
satisfied
these
causal
requirements.
the
particular
default
acquisitions
were
not
for
a
federal
program
or
project
because
they
were
not
intended
to
further
the
purposes
of
the
program.
in
addition
the
plans
hud
subsequently
developed
for
disposing
of
the
property
do
not
meet
the
statutory
requirements
because
these
plans
were
not
the
reason
for
acquiring
the
property
in
the
first
place.
according
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
1463
is
reversed
and
the
judgment
in
874
is
affirmed.
