mr.

i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever

ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
this
is
not
the
core
of
the
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
necessarily
treat
the
government's
efforts
to
collect
on
its
indebtedness
as
a
program
in
the
same
sense
that
building
a
bridge
or
a
new
road
or
new
highway
is
a
program,
is
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
exclusions
as
a
bank
when
it
tries
to
collect
from
its
debts
on
its
guarantees,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
functions
the
same
way
a
bank
does
when
a
bank
forecloses
a
mortgage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
mechanics
are
the
same

bryson.
