justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
contention
that
the
word
"person"
in
206
(b)
is
more
broadly
defined
than
the
term
“displaced
person”
in
the
definitional
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
one
place
that
might
come
from
the
fact
that
traditionally
under
eminent
domain
cases
moving
costs
were
not
an
allowable
element
of
just
compensation
and
congress
has
decided
to
add
that
as
an
element
of
just
compensation
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
permissive
but
not
permissible?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
the
person
who
simply
defaults
in
their
rent
and
has
given
a
written
notice
to
move
from
the
property
because
of
default?
well,
i
don't
think
the
words
of
the
statute
cover
that
person
and
certainly
the
sense
of
the
statute
does
not.
that's
a
person
who's
committed
a
breach
of
contract
and
that
ordinary
remedies
for
breach
of
contract
are
include
the
one
you
suggested.
i
don't
think
that
is
a
person
who
has
moved
as
a
result
of
a
written
order
of
an
acquiring
agency
for
program
or
project.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
thing
is
lacking
is
the
program
or
project.
i
don't
think
that
what
caused
that
particular
tenant
to
be
displaced
is
a
program
or
project.
i
don't
think
that
was
to
set
up
or
pursuant
to
a
program
or
project
that
was
then
in
process.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
it's
an
eminent
domain
type
of
case.
if
you
answer
justice
stewart's
question
is
no.
if
a
program
that
simply
says
people
are
going
to
be
evicted
from
their
existing
housing
who
don't
pay
their
rent
is
not
that
with
anything
then
it
has
to
be
an
eminent
domain
type
of
thing
where
they're
taking
all
their
property.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
written
order
clause
does
require
that
the
written
order
come
from
the
“acquiring
agency”
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
don't
you
think
that
that
must
contemplate
an
acquisition
as
well
as
the
first
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
written
order
isn't
separate
and
apart
from
an
acquisition.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
must
be
a
proposed
acquisition
at
least
and
in
both
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
that
if
hud
acquired
property
in
1957,
that
would
qualify
it
as
an
acquiring
agency
and
then
if
it
gives
notice
to
vacate
in
1977,
it
comes
under
the
written
order
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
relied
on
by
the
lower
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
relied
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
court
of
appeals
with
the
district
columbia
circuit?
