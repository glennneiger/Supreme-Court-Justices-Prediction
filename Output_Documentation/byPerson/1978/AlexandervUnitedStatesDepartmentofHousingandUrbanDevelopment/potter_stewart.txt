justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
program
is
simply
not
to
allow
tenants
to
remain
in
the
property
who
don't
pay
their
rent
or
who
are
very
destructive
or
whatever,
that's
part
of
the
program?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
come,
what
as
my
brother
rehnquist
suggests
that
that
seem
to
come
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
if
your
case
does.
justice
potter
stewart
the
cases
are
factually
quite
different
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
fall
under
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
as
you
construe.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
would
precisely
describe
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
hypothetical
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
be
--
it
could
be
by
lease
you
could
just
be
taking
possession,
couldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
it
need
not
be
a
fee?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
it's
a
present
participle
not
an
adjective.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
statute
was
enacted
this
year?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
kind
of
a
directorate
to
tell
hud
they
will
minimize
the
number
of
evictions?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
requiring
hud
to
report?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
the
success
of
such
minimizations?
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
statute,
just
looking
at
it,
there's
second
or
third
reason,
evem
third
was
seems
to
provide
two,
only
two
alternatives.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
the
acquisition
or
as
a
result
of
a
written
order.
there's
nothing
about
a
written
notice
to
acquire.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what,
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
what
do
you
say
the
government
concedes?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
so
understand
it
though.
i
may
have
misunderstood
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
that
was
a
written
order.
justice
potter
stewart
sent
to
mr.
jones.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
mr.
jones,
you
have
to
get
out
and
why
isn't
that
a
written
order?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
no,
your
point
is
that
the
acquisition
kind
of
occurred
in
the
past?
justice
potter
stewart
therefore
it's
not
a
proposed
acquisition.
it's
an
acquisition
that
occurred
historically
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
acquiring
agency
has
ownership
or
occupancy
of
the
premises.
that's
the
written
order.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
exactly
his
omission.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
order
has
to
come
from
the
agency
that
acquired
the
property,
doesn't
it,
under
the
clear
cut
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
from
the
acquiring
agency?
justice
potter
stewart
so
if
an
agency
--
so
acquisition
is
key
and
crucial
in
that
sense?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
wife
or
the
acquiring
agency
have
got
out
of
this
if
you're
correct
as
to
convey
it
to
a
private
person
and
then
have
him
issue
the
notice?
