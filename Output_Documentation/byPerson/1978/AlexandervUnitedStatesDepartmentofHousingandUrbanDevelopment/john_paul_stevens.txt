this

wasn't

justice
john
paul
stevens
this
program
wasn't
doing
that,
this
was
disposing
a
house
that
they
couldn't
use.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
particular
program,
decrease
the
total
amount
of
housing
available
to
the
people
they
are
intending
to
serve.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
had
instead
of
foreclosing
--
instead
of
evicting
themselves
just
after
they
foreclosed,
sold
the
property
to
some
private
entity
and
not
the
private
the
party,
do
the
eviction
and
destruction
and
so
forth,
and
rehabilitation,
then
i
gather
you've
had
--
there'd
be
no
claim
because
it
would
not
be
the
acquiring
agency
that
did
the
evicting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
tell
me,
you
mentioned
that
10
years
of
study
of
this
problem
by
congress,
how
much
of
that
study
was
included
discussion
of
problem
associated
with
foreclosure
of
mortgages
and
the
eviction
of
people
from
projects
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
before
you
sit
down,
i
think
there
were
as
i
remember
the
facts,
some
of
the
people
from
sky
tower
who
did
receive
$300.00
of
some
kind
of
relocation
system.
justice
john
paul
stevens
pursuant
to
what
statutory
authority
was
that
going
to
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
go
ahead
continue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there's
also
been
a,
there's
a
motion
to
dismissed,
its
writ
has
been
probably
granted,
i
believe
filed
by
your
opponent
and
i
believe
they
called
our
attention.
in
fact,
there's
pending
some
new
regulation
being
prepared
dealing
with
this
whole
subject
matter.
i
don't
recall,
i
am
not
going
to
look
at
it,
now
is
that
pursuant
to
some
new
statutory
authority
or
what
statutory
authority
for
what's
being
done
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
vanderstar,
would
it
not
be
possible
if
there
will
be
a
written
order
before
the
acquisition
was
consummated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
could
that
be
covered
if
he
didn't
have
the
written
order
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
it
be
covered
if
there
are
written
notice
of
intent
to
acquire
but
no
acquisition
and
a
written
order
to
vacate?
at
least,
we
need
the
written
order
clause
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
every
owner
is
an
acquiring
agency
within
the
meaning
that
you
gave?
justice
john
paul
stevens
cause
it
had
to
acquire
at
some
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
acquiring
really,
this
adds
nothing
to
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
say
owner,
the
owning
agency
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
--
would
there
be
--
