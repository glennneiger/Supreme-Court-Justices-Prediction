mr.
john
vanderstar
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
fall
of
1974,
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
evicted
nearly
200
families
from
their
homes
in
two
federally
subsidized
housing
projects.
one
located
in
indianapolis
and
one
in
anacostia
section
of
washington,
d.c.
hud
had
acquired
those
projects
after
the
project
sponsors
defaulted
on
their
mortgages
which
hud
had
insured.
both
projects
were
in
need
of
rehabilitation
and
the
anacostia
project
called
sky
tower
was
halfway
through
the
rehabilitation
process.
hud
analyzed
the
cost
of
completing
the
rehabilitation
or
performing
the
rehabilitation,
analyzed
the
expected
revenues
from
the
projects
and
a
number
of
other
factors
and
each
case
made
the
decision
to
evict
the
tenants
and
then
sell
the
vacant
property
to
private
developers.
some
of
the
sky
tower
tenants,
the
anacostia
tenants
received
moving
allowances
of
$300.00
each,
some
did
not.
but
--
and
none
of
the
indianapolis
tenants
receive
moving
allowances.
moreover,
hud
did
not
satisfy
itself
before
evicting
these
people
that
there
was
some
place
else
they
could
live.
some
place
they
could
afford.
the
effect
on
these
people
was
devastating
especially
on
the
larger
families,
the
elderly
and
the
poor
which
is
what
most
of
these
people
are.
in
the
cole
record,
there
is
some
illustrations.
mrs.
irma
francis,
her
rent
went
from
$77.00
a
month
to
a
$165.00
a
month.
she's
employed
and
earned
$400.00
a
month
and
supports
three
children.
mrs.
sadie
cole,
her
rent
went
from
$84.00
a
month
to
a
$156.00
a
month.
she
received
$228.00
a
month
in
public
assistance.
she
has
two
children.
mrs.
jean
fisher,
her
rent
went
from
$84.00
a
month
to
$189.00
a
month.
her
monthly
income
is
$243.00.
she
also
has
two
children.
judge
gesell
found
that
the
impact
of
this
move
on
the
larger
families
in
the
anacostia
project
was
especially
serious
because
of
the
shortage
of
housing,
low-cost
housing
especially
for
large
families
in
this
city.
as
he
pointed
out
the
waiting
list
of
public
housing
projects
in
washington,
most
of
them
in
the
four-bedroom
and
larger
category
exceeds
4,000
families.
now,
it's
difficult
for
most
of
us
in
this
room
to
imagine
trying
to
live
under
those
conditions.
but
congress
knew
about
those
conditions.
it
informed
itself,
it
studied
this
problem
over
course
of
many
years
and
it
enacted
statute,
the
relocation
act,
and
in
that
act
it
said
we
don't
want
this
to
happen
again
that
whenever
there's
a
federal
dollar
being
used
for
a
federal
project,
we
don't
want
to
displace
people
from
their
homes
unless,
unless
the
agency
is
satisfied
that
these
people
have
some
place
else
to
live,
some
place
they
can
afford.
both
sides
in
this
case
agree
that
the
critical
statutory
language
in
the
relocation
act
is
the
definition
and
in
particular
the
so-called
written
order
clause
in
the
definition
of
displaced
person.
a
displaced
person
is
someone
who
“moves
from
real
property”
either
as
a
result
of
the
acquisition
of
such
real
property
that's
the
acquisition
clause
or
is
the
result
of
the
written
order
of
the
acquiring
agency
to
vacate
real
property,
that's
the
written
order
clause.
and
in
either
case,
it
has
to
be
for
a
program
or
project
undertaken
by
a
federal
agency.
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
had
to
put
my
case
in
a
nutshell,
i
would
say
that
the
language
of
the
written
order
clause
covers
the
tenants
in
these
two
cases
and
that,
that
result,
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
the
relocation
act.
the
acquisition
clause
was
relied
on
below
but
it's
not
relied
on
here.
mr.
john
vanderstar
by
this
displacement,
yes.
certainly,
the
whole
focus
of
congress'
study
going
back
to
1961,
nine
years
before
the
act
became
effective
was
on
displacement
caused
by
federal
programs
or
federally
assisted
program
which
are
not
pertinent
here.
the
written
order
clause
i
think
plainly
covers
these
people.
they
move
as
a
result
of
a
written
order
of
the
acquiring
agency
namely
hud,
the
agency
that
had
acquired
these
properties.
and
the
orders
were
issued
pursuant
to
a
federal
program
or
project.
what
was
that
program
or
project?
it's
spelled
out
in
about
150
pages
of
material
in
the
hud
handbook
called
“the
property
disposition
handbook”
which
describes
the
property
disposition
program
that
is
to
be
employed
by
hud
when
it
acquires
properties
through
mortgage
default.
it's
perfectly
clear
we
submit
that
there
was
a
program
or
project
that
led
to
the
displacement
of
these
tenants.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
a
written
order
of
the
acquiring
agency
caused
their
displacement
so
that
written
order
clause
applies.
now
let's
see
if
that
makes
sense.
let's
look
at
the
statute
overall
and
see
if
that
makes
sense.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
place,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
look
for
the
overall
intent
of
congress
is
in
the
section
entitled
“declaration
of
policy”
which
is
section
201
of
the
act
and
it
says
this,“the
purpose
of
this
sub-chapter
and
that's
the
relocation
title
of
these
complex
statute
is
to
establish
a
uniform
policy
for
the
fair
and
equitable
treatment
of
persons
displaced
as
a
result
of
federal
and
federally
assisted
programs,
in
order
that”
and
i'm
still
quoting
“in
order
that
such
persons
shall
not
suffer
disproportionate
injuries
as
a
result
of
programs
designed
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
as
a
whole,”
so
the
emphasis
is
perfectly
plain.
so,
the
emphasis
is
on
persons
displaced
as
a
result
of
federal
and
federally
assisted
programs.
these
tenants
were
displaced
as
a
result
of
a
federal
program.
there's
another
place
we
can
look
in
the
statute
for
evidence
of
congressional
intent.
it's
more
statutory
language
and
that
is
in
section
206
(b).
i
might
point
out
that
this
statute
covers
not
only
tenants
and
not
only
homeowners
but
it
also
covers
businesses
and
farms.
but
in
section
206
(b),
congress
made
it
quite
clear
that
where
people
were
being
displaced
from
their
homes,
congress
had
a
special
concern
as
you
would
imagine.
and
in
section
206
(b),
congress
used
these
unequivocal
words
“no
person
shall
be
required
to
move
from
his
dwelling
on
or
after
january
2,
1971
on
account
of
any
federal
project
unless
the
federal
agency
head
is
satisfied
that
replacement
housing
in
accordance
with
section
205
(c)
(3)
is
available
to
such
person.
now
205
(c)
(3)
refers
to
replacement
housing
that
meets
a
great
number
of
characteristics.
and
the
most
important
one,
i
submit
is
this
one,
at
rents
or
prices
within
the
financial
means
of
the
families
and
individuals
displaced.
there
are
others
as
well
but
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
in
201
the
declaration
of
policy
covering
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
in
206
(b),
that
portion
of
the
statute
which
announces
congress'
policy
with
respect
to
displacement
of
people
from
their
homes
from
their
dwellings
that
these
people
were
intended
to
be
covered
by
the
relocation
act.”
mr.
john
vanderstar
i
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute,
yes,
sir.
but
i'm
relying
on
206
(b)
primarily
to
establish
as
clearly
as
i
can
the
overall
purpose
congress
had
in
mind
in
enacting
the
statute.
but
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
i
think
it
is
broader.
mr.
john
vanderstar
well,
i
don't
think
there's
a
connection
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes,
sir.
i
think
they
are
parallel.
i
think
you
go
through
one
root
or
you
go
through
the
other
and
it
doesn't
matter
as
long
as
you
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
that's
right
and
i
think
that
helps
to
explain
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
exactly,
exactly.
we
think
there
has
to
be
an
acquiring
agency
because
the
written
order
clause
talks
about
a
written
order
of
the
acquiring
agency.
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
vanderstar
well,
because.
mr.
john
vanderstar
well,
it's
a
weaker
argument
i
can
see
that,
your
honor.
but
certainly
the
written
order
clause
is
the
one
we
rely
on
here.
now,
it's
been
suggested
by
the
government
in
their
briefs
that
this
statute
should
not
be
read
in
the
way
i
have
outlined
that
the
written
order
clause
should
not
applied
to
cover
the
tenants
in
these
two
cases.
why
is
that?
well,
the
government's
principal
argument,
if
i
can
take
the
liberty
of
putting
words
in
their
mouth,
is
that
the
program
or
project
that
leads
to
the
eviction
has
to
be
the
same
program
or
project
that
lead
to
the
acquisition
so
that
if
you
have
an
acquisition
for
one
program
or
project
and
then
you
have
a
displacement
for
another
program
or
project,
the
government
contends
those
displaced
tenants
are
not
covered.
i
find
it
hard
to
see
where
that
interpretation
comes
from.
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
and
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
supports
that
interpretation.
indeed,
i
think
it
quite
clear
as
i've
indicated
that
congress
was
focusing
on
displacement.
this
is
not
an
internal
revenue
code.
this
is
not
a
statute
that
is
meant
to
be
read
restrictively.
this
is
not
a
statute
in
which
the
words
are
meant
to
be
words
of
limitation.
this
is
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
that's
one
permissive
–-
one
possible
interpretation
but
i
don't
think
it's
permissible
interpretation.
mr.
john
vanderstar
no,
i
say
it's
one
possible
interpretation
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
permissible
interpretation.
i
don't
think
this
is
an
eminent
domain
statute.
i
think
section
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
that's
correct.
this
is
not
an
eminent
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
no,
sir.
nor
i
think
this
eminent
domain
define
the
outer
limits
of
the
statute.
i
think
congress
made
it
clear
that
it
was
talking
about
displacement,
not
about
eminent
domain.
now
it
is
true,
it
is
true
that
all
the
hearings
and
all
the
reports
and
all
the
discussion
or
at
least
most
of
it
that
led
up
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute
was
talking
about
eminent
domain,
that
type
of
acquisition.
there's
a
good
reason
for
that.
there
were
very
few
programs
then
in
existence
under
which
hud
could
come
to
acquire
a
property
because
of
the
mortgage
default.
furthermore,
there
were
probably
no
cases
but
i
don't
know
that
because
it's
not
the
record
in
which
hud
not
only
acquire
the
property
after
mortgage
default
but
then
evicted
the
tenants.
mr.
john
vanderstar
well,
what's
lacking?
certainly,
the
written
order
is
there,
the
written
notice
of
default?
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes,
sir.
but
i
think
that
and
certainly
the
written
order
to
evicting
a
person
who
did
not
pay
their
rent
or
defaulted
on
their
mortgage
is
issued
pursuant
to
that.
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
kind
of
program
or
project
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
john
vanderstar
i
think
the
cases
are
quite
different.
mr.
john
vanderstar
i
don't
think
so
because
i
construe
the
words
program
or
project
in
a
different
way.
i
say,
and
the
tenants
contend
that
program
or
project
is
a
decision
by
the
agency,
a
programmatic
decision
relating
to
that
property
which
leads
to
eviction
of
the
tenants.
mr.
john
vanderstar
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
john
vanderstar
well,
eminent
domain,
there
is
no
eminent
domain
used
here.
the
way
hud
got
the
property
was
because
of
the
mortgage
default
and
hud's
decision
to
foreclose
on
the
mortgage
in
both
cases,
mortgages.
hud
did
not
acquire
the
properties
for
eminent
domain.
in
a
sense,
i
suppose
one
could
say
that
by
taking
over
the
leasehold
interest
of
the
tenants
in
these
two
subsidized
housing
projects
hud
has
acquired
their
leasehold
interest
and
has
evicted
them
pursuant
to
that
acquisition.
that's
the
--
that
i
think
is
a
permissible
reading
of
the
statute
and
at
least
do
the
same
result
that
we
seek
on
our
reading
of
the
written
order
clause.
i
think
the
main
problem
with
the
defaulting
tenant
or
the
defaulting
mortgage
point
is
there's
nothing
in
the
sense
of
the
statute
in
the
purpose
of
the
statute
that
would
suggest
that
that's
what
congress
might
have
had
in
mind.
congress
did
not
focus
on
all
the
people
who
breached
contracts
and
then
suffer
the
consequences.
congress
focused
on
and
had
in
mind
that
people
who
are
displaced
because
of
federal
programs
that
cause
displacement.
and
i
think
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
the
kind
of
federal
program
that
we
have
here.
a
federal
program
under
which
hud
finds
itself
as
it
probably
should
have
expected
to
find
itself
in
a
good
many
cases
with
a
property
after
a
mortgage
default
and
after
hud's
decision
to
foreclose
on
the
mortgage.
now,
what's
hud
going
to
with
that
property?
it
goes
into
his
property
disposition
handbook
and
develops
its
property
disposition
program
and
it
reviews
all
the
costs.
and
it
reviews
whatever
the
other
factors
are
in
that
enormous
handbook
and
it
makes
a
considered
choice
among
different
alternatives
and
the
choice
it
made
in
these
two
cases,
and
i
suggests
that
it
makes
rarely
but
it
does
make
them
from
time
to
time
is
to
shutdown
the
project,
sell
the
property
to
somebody
else
and
recover
the
government's
money.
now,
the
question
here
is
if
there
are
going
to
be
costs
to
the
tenants,
who
is
going
to
bear
those
costs?
will
it
be
the
tenants?
will
it
be
the
very
families
that
congress
was
focusing
on
in
nearly
10
years
of
study
of
this
relocation
problem?
will
they
bear
the
brunt
of
that
displacement
or
should
we
all
bear
it
as
taxpayers?
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
a
program.
it
is
an
act
taken
by
the
government
designed
for
the
public
as
a
whole.
we
recall
please
that
hud
is
not
a
commercial
lending
agency
to
use
judge
gesell's
words.
hud
is
in
this
business
for
a
much
broader
and
very
different
social
purpose.
hud
was
established
by
the
congress
and
all
those
housing
acts
that
congress
has
been
passing
for
the
last
40
odd
years
have
not
established
hud
as
a
bank.
and
so
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
well,
it
functions
as
a
creditor
when
tries
to
collect
all
its
debts.
mr.
john
vanderstar
not
completely,
your
honor.
because
a
bank
has
stockholders
and
it
has
other
interests
that
it
has
to
be
answerable
to.
mr.
john
vanderstar
the
mechanics
may
be
the
same
but
the
decisional
process
is
very
different.
hud
is
not,
does
not,
and
should
not
sit
there
the
way
bank
does
and
say,
we'll
how
can
we
maximize
our
return
on
our
investment.
hud's
purpose
is
to
maintain
and
increase
the
nation's
supply
of
housing
and
particularly
for
low
and
moderate-income
families
and
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
john
vanderstar
well,
it
wasn't
--
the
housing
they
couldn't
use,
it
was
housing
that
didn't
feel
like
paying
to
rehabilitate.
in
that
sense,
it
was
a
bankers
type
decision.
mr.
john
vanderstar
indeed,
it
did.
mr.
john
vanderstar
that
would
be
a
much
tougher
case.
mr.
john
vanderstar
none
that
we
can
find,
your
honor
and
i
think
the
principle
reason
is
that
those
programs,
most
of
them
didn't
exist
in
those
days,
the
236
program
for
example
that
the
sky
tower
project
was
subsidized
under.
that
didn't
come
into
existence
until
august
1968
and
it
takes
time
to
get
houses
built.
it
takes
time
for
them
to
go
into
default
and
then
it
takes
time
for
hud
to
get
their
hands
on
them
and
it's
very
likely,
very
likely
that
hud
simply
did
not
have
to
face
this
problem
before
the
relocation
act
was
passed.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes
your
honor
thank
you.
i
don't
know
whether
why
it's
relevant
that
some
of
these
properties
are
30
or
40
years
old
the
fact
that
as
riverhouse
was
built
in
1969
and
hud
has
held
the
mortgage
since
december
1970
if
there's
been
any
deterioration,
i
don't
know
why
the
fingers
are
being
pointed
but
perhaps
that's
the
place
to
point
the
finger.
i
do
want
to
talk
for
a
moment
about
mr.
jones
though
because
the
government's
position
is
that
the
language
of
the
written
order
clause
applies
to
a
proposed
but
unconsummated
acquisition
and
to
a
displacement
that
results
from
a
written
notice
of
intent
to
acquire.
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
written
notice
that
says
written
order.
furthermore,
the
government
relies
very
heavily
on
the
word
acquisition
in
the
sections
of
the
statute
other
than
the
definition
of
sections
that
provide
the
specific
benefits
and
services.
now,
i
might
point
out
that
we
conceive
there
was
acquisition
in
this
case
than
we
conceive
that
one
is
required
so
we
don't
have
a
difference
between
us
on
that
issue.
but
the
question
is
if
the
acquisition
resulted
in
the
displacement,
then
the
acquisition
clause
applies.
the
question
before
the
court
is
what
happens
if
something
else
resulted
in
the
displacement.
if
it
was
a
written
order
not
the
acquisition
but
a
written
order
and
we
suggest
that's
exactly
why
congress
put
the
written
order
clause
in
the
definitional
section.
because
if
you
had
to
wait
for
an
acquisition
to
cause
the
displacement,
you
wouldn't
need
the
written
order
clause.
mr.
john
vanderstar
i
don't
think
you'd
call
that
a
written
order
and
hud
does
not.
in
hud's
regulations,
they
talk
about
three
ways
people
can
qualify
in
general
under
this
definition
and
they
talked
about
a
written
notice
of
intent
to
acquire.
they
talked
about
an
acquisition
and
they
talked
about
a
written
order
to
vacate.
we
agree
with
hud
and
we
agree
with
the
hud
regulations
that
there
are
three
different
situations
covered
by
the
statutory
language,
the
acquisition,
a
written
notice
of
intent,
to
acquire
even
when
the
acquisition
doesn't
take
place.
we
agree
that
that
is
proper.
mr.
john
vanderstar
i
think
it
could
be
covered
under
either
clause
as
the
latham
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
john
vanderstar
well,
it
wouldn't
be
a
written
order
to
vacate
if
it
please
the
court.
it
would
be
a
written
notice
of
intent
to
vacate,
that's
the
way
hud
describes
it
and
that's
the
way
the
statutory
history
describes
it.
mr.
john
vanderstar
well,
there
are
two
alternative
clauses
but
there
may
be
lots
of
cases
that
are
covered
by
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
i
understand
that
and
it's
rather
curious
--
it's
rather
curious
that
the
government
does
not
want
the
court
to
apply
the
statute
the
way
we
think
it
was
written
but
concedes
that
it
does
apply
in
the
case
that
the
language
doesn't
cover.
there
is
nothing
in
the
words
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
vanderstar
the
government
concedes
indeed,
asserts
that
a
written
notice
of
intent
to
acquire
even
when
there's
no
acquisition
is
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
john
vanderstar
that's
the
mr.
jones
example
that
mr.
bryson
talked
about.
mr.
john
vanderstar
that
was
a
written
notice
of
intent
to
acquire?
mr.
john
vanderstar
that's
right.
and
the
government
says
that's
covered.
mr.
john
vanderstar
not
have
to
get
out
but
you'd
be
smart
to
get
out
because
we're
going
to
acquire
this
property
a
year
from
now.
i
think
that's
the
case
the
government
is
putting.
mr.
john
vanderstar
we're
going
to
acquire
this
property
a
year
from
now,
we're
giving
you
notice
of
our
intent
to
do
so.
so
mr.
jones
leaves.
obviously,
it
would
be
quite
unfair
to
mr.
jones
to
deny
him
benefits
and
services
if
the
government
later
changed
its
mind.
we
concede
that.
but
the
curious
thing
is
that
the
words
of
the
statute
simply
don't
carry
that
meaning.
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
statute
does
and
that's
what
we
think
the
court
should
have
in
mind
when
it
reads
the
written
order
clause
as
it
applies
to
this
case.
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes
and
there
was
an
acquisition
in
both
of
these
cases.
mr.
john
vanderstar
oh!
it's
separate
and
apart
from
or
else
there
wouldn't
be
a
need
for
two
different
clauses.
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
john
vanderstar
oh!
yes.
yes,
there
has
to
be
an
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
proposed
or
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes,
sir.
congress
said
so.
mr.
john
vanderstar
congress
said
so
in
section
219
which
is
not
codified,
it's
the
so-called
mary
hill
section.
that
was
designed
at
the
urging
of
then
representative
now
mayor
koch
of
new
york
to
cover
a
situation
in
which
it
was
expected
that
people
would
be
displaced
before
the
act
became
effective
and
clearly
they
would
not
be
covered.
mr.
john
vanderstar
i
believe
it
was
referred
to,
yes.
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes,
i
think
so
but
i'm
not
positive
of
that.
the
two
lower
courts
came
up
in
opposite
directions
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
i
can't
be
certain
of
that.
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes,
they
are.
mr.
john
vanderstar
no,
sir.
i'm
saying
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
if
there's
a
written
order
to
vacate
in
1977
that
otherwise
meets
the
statutory
language,
the
fact
that
the
acquisition
occurred
20
years
earlier
is
irrelevant.
mr.
john
vanderstar
that's
right.
mr.
john
vanderstar
that's
right
that's
why
i
said
this
is
not
an
eminent
domain
statute.
this
is
a
statute
that
focuses
on
displacement.
mr.
john
vanderstar
it
is
a
displacement
statute.
it's
a
statute
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
vanderstar
well,
you
need
to
have
an
acquisition
at
some
point
in
the
past
because
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
i
don't
think
the
acquisition
is
very
important
but
it
is
in
the
statute
and
we
meet
it
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
john
vanderstar
acquisition
at
some
time
in
the
past
is
important.
yes.
and
acquisition
did
occur
in
this
case.
mr.
john
vanderstar
that's
right.
mr.
john
vanderstar
that's
right.
that
simply
meant
to
identify
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
except
that
it
identifies
which
agency
issues
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
it
could
have
said
owning
agency
but
it
said
acquiring
agency.
i
don't
think
the
difference
is
important.
mr.
john
vanderstar
well,
normally
it's
a
particular
agency
that
issues
it.
mr.
john
vanderstar
i
suppose
--
mr.
john
vanderstar
if
it's
for
program
or
project,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
vanderstar
that
might
be
a
way
out.
mr.
john
vanderstar
or
not
to
displace
people.
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes.
mr.
john
vanderstar
the
united
states
position
--
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
is
a
little
bit
unclear.
the
united
states,
the
government's
position
here
isn't.
mr.
john
vanderstar
yes,
i
think
it
has.
but
the
second
circuit
case
is
really
a
different
problem,
that's
the
acquisition
clause
not
the
written
order
clause.
mr.
john
vanderstar
that's
only
one
court,
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case.
mr.
john
vanderstar
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
vanderstar
not
under
written
order
clause.
