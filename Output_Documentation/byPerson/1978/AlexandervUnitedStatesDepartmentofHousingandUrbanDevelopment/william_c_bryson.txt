mr.
william
c.
bryson
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
the
uniform
relocation
act
applies
when
the
government
acquires
property
for
a
public
purpose
and
people
are
displaced
as
a
result.
it
does
not
apply
when
the
government
already
owns
property
and
it
orders
tenants
to
move
in
order
they
can
put
some
other
use,
make
some
other
use
of
that
property.
in
other
words,
we
see
this
act
as
in
mr.
vanderstar's
words,
an
eminent
domain
statute
primarily.
in
other
words,
if
this
statute
applies
to
cases
in
which
the
government
is
acting
in
its
capacity
as
taker
of
property,
whether
that
be
by
purchase
or
by
condemnation.
the
plaintiff's
view
the
act
as
applicable
in
cases
in
which
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
could
be
acquiring
a
property
until
so
that
sort.
that
would
certainly
be
a
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
does
not
have
to
be
a
fee,
that's
correct.
but
in
any
event,
it
would
be
acquiring
the
property
or
at
least
the
acquiring
an
interest
in
the
property.
the
--
the
plaintiffs
view
this
case
more
broadly
as
they've
said
as
including
cases
in
which
the
government
is
acting
basically
in
its
capacity
as
landlord.
now,
to
underscore
the
difference
between
the
positions
that
the
parties
have
taken
in
this
case,
let's
take
an
example.
suppose,
hud
had
acquired
this
property,
20
or
30
years
ago,
in
that
case
the
plaintiffs
would
say
that
if
these
people
have
been
living
and
others
have
been
living
on
the
property
ever
since
that
time
and
hud
decided
at
some
point
that
they
needed
to
make
some
other
use
of
the
property,
perhaps,
the
property
was
deteriorating
or
something
as
was
the
case
in
this
cases.
they
even
decided
to
make
some
other
use
of
the
property
then
in
the
plaintiff's
view,
once
they
were
ordered
to
leave
the
property,
they
will
be
entitled
to
relocation
benefits.
we
say
that
isn't
the
case
because
the
key
element,
the
key
factor
that
triggers
this
act
would
be
missing
which
would
be
that
the
displacement
would
not
have
been
caused
by
the
acquisition.
now,
we
find
support
for
our
interpretation
of
the
act
in
the
language
of
the
statute
in
the
context
and
structure
of
the
statute
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
before
i
go
into
the
language
of
the
statute,
i'd
like
to
underscore
one
point
about
its
context
which
as
--
is
that
the
uniform
relocation
act
is
actually
part
of
a
much
broader
statute.
it's
title
2
of
the
uniform
relocation
assistance
and
land,
excuse
me,
and
real
property
acquisition
policy's
act.
in
other
words
this
act
deals
with
the
problems
of
real
property
acquisition
by
the
federal
government
and
by
state
governments.
the
act
was
passed
in
order
to
remedy
some
of
the
problems,
some
of
the
inadequacies
that
were
perceived
in
eminent
domain
law.
eminent
domain
law
does
not
provide
benefits
to
take
care
of
incidental
and
consequential
expenses
that
are
suffered
by
people
who
are
forced
to
move
as
result
of
acquisitions
of
property.
congress
tried
to
deal
with
this
problem
and
a
number
of
other
problems
and
eminent
domain
law
with
this
statute.
title
3
addresses
a
number
of
these
problems.
title
2
addresses
what
congress
perceives
it's
the
most
serious
problem
which
was
the
problem
of
relocation
of
people
who
are
displaced
by
acquisitions
of
property.
now,
going
to
the
precise
language
that
the
plaintiffs
rely
on,
they
rely
on
the
definition
of
displaced
persons
in
the
act
and
particularly
on
the
written
order
clause,
indeed
exclusively
on
the
written
order
clause.
now,
the
two
clauses
have
been
over
the
acquisition
clause.
the
second
clause,
the
written
order
clause
says
that
a
person
is
entitled
to
--
well
a
person
is
defined
as
a
displaced
person
if
he
moves
as
the
result
of
the
written
order
of
an
acquiring
agency.
now,
the
plaintiffs
say
that
this
includes
them
because
hud
had
acquired
the
property.
we
interpret
the
words
acquiring
agency
to
mean
an
agency
that
is
acquiring
an
agency
that
is
engaged
in
an
acquisition.
in
other
words,
as
we
read
just
these
words
without
going
any
farther
we
say
acquiring
agency
has
to
be
an
agency
that
is
more
or
less
contemporaneously
engaged
in
an
acquisition.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
the
--
i
think
if
we
look
further
into
the
statute,
we
find
further
support
for
this
interpretation
of
the
language.
particularly,
important
i
think,
it
is
to
look
at
the
operative
sections
of
the
act,
the
sections
that
grant
the
actual
benefits.
when
we
look
to
them
we
find
that
those
sections
actually
talk
in
terms
of
acquisition.
they
don't
contemplate
people
in
the
position
of
the
plaintiffs
and
that's
the
best
key
i
think
to
what
this
written
order
clause
really
means.
for
example,
section
202
of
the
act
which
is
4622,
i
believe
in
the
u.s.
code.
section
202
applies
to
moving
expenses.
now,
section
202
provides
for
moving
expenses
for
people
who
in
which
the
acquisition
will
result
in
a
displacement.
it
doesn't
contemplate
people
for
whom
the
acquisition
occurred
long
ago
and
who
are
being
displaced
by
written
order.
it
turns
on
the
existence
of
an
acquisition.
now,
the
plaintiffs
say
that
this
is
just
sloppy
language
and
that
it
doesn't
cover
our
interpretation
of
the
written
order
clause
either.
now,
our
interpretation
of
the
written
order
clause
is
just
this.
we
say
that
the
written
order
clause
was
designed
to
take
care
of
the
case
in
which
there
was
a
notice
to
move
in
anticipation
of
the
acquisition.
but
in
fact
the
acquisition
never
took
place.
now,
there's
a
very
good
reason
that
that
written
order
clause
is
in
the
statute
which
is
to
take
an
example,
suppose
mr.
jones
got
an
order
from
the
department
of
transportation,
"jones
we're
going
to
be
taking
your
property
and
in
two
months
it's
going
to
be
acquired
be
out
by
june
15."
and
jones,
in
reliance
on
this,
logically
enough,
reasonably
enough
decided
he'd
better
move
and
he
moved.
now,
if
the
statute
had
only
the
acquisition
clause
and
it
turned
out
that
the
department
of
transportation
decided
after
jones
had
moved
that
they
weren't
going
to
take
the
property
after
all,
jones
would
be
out
of
lack.
that's
why
the
written
order
clause
is
in
the
statute
to
make
sure
that
if
the
department
of
transportation
gives
jones
a
notice,
get
out
by
june
15
and
jones
moves
in
reliance
on
that,
it
doesn't
matter
if
there
is
an
acquisition.
and
that
he
is
right
in
to
the
benefit
sections
of
the
act
because
section
202,
the
moving
expenses
section
provides
that
benefits
are
available
when
the
acquisition
will
result
in
displacement
and
in
mr.
jones'
case,
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
the
acquisition
will
result
in
his
displacement.
even
though
in
fact,
this
things
turned
out
no
acquisition
took
place.
same
thing
applies
to
the
relocation
assistance
advisory
services
that
are
discussed
in
section
205
of
the
act
which
is
4625.
now,
again,
it
uses
language
that
the
benefits
are
available
when
the
acquisition
will
result
in
the
displacement.
this
wouldn't
apply
to
the
parties,
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
that
--
this
clearly
indicates
that
acquisition
is
the
key
here
and
that
of
course,
as
we
say,
our
interpretation
of
the
written
order
clause
is
consistent
with
us
again.
similarly,
the
third
operative
section
applies
the
same
way.
it's
a
somewhat
different
language
but
again
it
points
to
the
key
factor
of
acquisition
as
being
the
heart
of
this
statute
and
that
is
section
204
which
is
4624
which
provides
benefits
to
persons
who
are
living
in
their
dwellings
at
least
90
days
before
the
initiation
of
negotiations
for
the
acquisition.
now,
if
hud
had
acquired
this
property
20
years
ago
that
statute
wouldn't
make
any
sense
if
applied
in
the
sense
that
the
plaintiffs
are
trying
to
make
it
apply.
because
this
clearly
contemplates
that
the
acquisition
is
the
core
notion
of
what
triggers
the
act.
in
other
words,
the
reason
for
the
90-day
gap,
the
90-day
period
here,
that's
specified
in
the
statute
is
that
the
act
wants
to
avoid
people
coming
in
two
days
before
the
acquisition
after
they've
heard
that
the
acquisition
was
coming
and
getting
relocation
benefits
but
it
turns
basically
again
on
acquisition.
now,
looking
to
the
legislative
history
of
this
act,
we
see
the
same
point
underscored
again.
this
legislative
history
is
quite
extensive
and
we've
gone
through
it
in
some
detail
in
our
brief.
but
i
like
to
touch
on
just
a
few
points
here.
first,
the
beginning
of
the
consideration
of
this
problem
came
essentially
in
about
1961
when
the
house
public
works
committee
set
up
a
select
sub-committee
on
real
property
acquisition.
now,
again
note
and
i
harp
on
this
theme
again
and
again
but
it
is
the
core
of
the
case
that
this
sub-committee
was
devoted
to
the
problem
of
real
property
acquisition.
the
sub-committee
came
up
with
the
proposal,
a
proposed
statute
which
is
entitled
the
“fair
compensation
act.”
now
as
i've
mentioned,
this
fair
compensation
act
was
part
of
the
effort
to
try
to
make
amendments
make
some
kind
of
improvements
on
bare
constitutional
eminent
domain
law,
to
try
to
solve
some
of
the
harshness
that
eminent
domain
law
produced
in
various
respects
by
paying
only
for
the
fair
market
value
of
property
that
was
taken.
one
of
the
purposes
or
one
of
the
aspects
that
this
act
addressed
was
the
problem
of
relocation
and
interestingly,
it
included
a
section
on
relocation
which
is
very
similar
in
structure
to
the
sections
on
relocation
that
appear
in
the
uniform
relocation
act
and
in
fact,
although
the
relocation
act
has
provided
in
some
respects
more
extensive
benefits
but
the
basic
core
was
here
and
what
was
particularly
important
is
that
the
core
definitional
section
was
similar.
what
the
definitional
section
said
was
that
benefits
are
available
to
persons
who
move
as
the
result
of
an
acquisition
or
the
eminence
of
the
acquisition.
now,
the
interesting
thing
about
this
is
that
this
is
the
grandfather
of
the
written
order
clause.
we
find
again
and
again
the
definition
of
displaced
persons
coming
up
as
a
person
who
is
displaced
as
the
result
of
an
acquisition
or
and
then
slightly
changed
language
as
we
go
through
the
development
of
the
act
through
its
numerous
drafts.
but
it
started
with
our
eminence
of
acquisition.
in
other
words,
they
were
dealing
with
precisely
the
kind
of
problem
we
are
trying
to
identify
here
which
is
our
friend,
jones,
who
leaves
in
reliance
on
an
acquisition
coming
down
the
road,
any
acquisition
never
actually
takes
place.
eminence
of
acquisition,
well
that
phrase
was
thought
to
be
too
broad.
it's
just
too
vague.
what
is
eminence
of
acquisition
to
somebody
who
get
benefits
if
he
has
a
feeling
that,
well,
i
have
a
feeling
they're
going
to
be
taking
my
property,
no.
he
gets
benefits
only
if
there's
some,
there's
got
to
be
some
better
way
to
figure
when
the
acquisition
is
in
fact
eminent.
so
that
although
eminence
of
acquisition
was
the
statutorial
language
that
was
introduced
in
the
first
bills
following
this
fair
compensation
act,
supposed
it
was
changed
fairly
quickly
to
reasonable
expectation
of
acquisition.
so
the
act
read
a
person
is
displaced
if
he
is
displaced
by
the
bill
at
that
time,
if
he
is
displaced
as
the
result
of
an
acquisition
or
reasonable
expectation
of
acquisition.
now,
that
went
through
several
drafts
of
the
bill
basically
unchanged
until
we
got
down
to
1969
in
which
the
bill
finally
made
its
way
into
law.
there
was
a
difference
interestingly
between
the
senate
bill
that
was
first
introduced
and
the
house
bill
that
was
first
introduced
first
in
this
last
round
of
drafts
of
the
relocation
act.
the
senate
bill
retained
this
language
that
one
is
displaced
if
one
is
required
to
move
as
a
result
of
an
acquisition
or
reasonable
expectation
of
acquisition.
whereas
the
house
bill
that
was
initially
introduced
was
somewhat
more
restrictive,
it
said
that
one
is
displaced
if
one
is
forced
to
move
as
a
result
of
an
acquisition
or
reasonable
expectation
of
acquisition
when
the
property
is
subsequently
acquired.
so
again,
under
the
house
bill,
mr.
jones
will
be
out
of
lack
again.
well,
the
--
it
was
clear
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
difference
between
these
two
positions
and
they
were
compromised.
they
were
compromised
in
what
became
the
written
order
clause
ant
that
is
that
what
happened
was
just
this.
that
the
written
order
clause
is
drafted
to
say,
alright,
it
will
be
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
reasonable
expectation
of
acquisition
is
too
broad
by
standing
by
itself.
there
ought
to
be
some
index
of
probability
of
acquisition
so
we'll
say
that
there
has
to
be
a
written
order
to
move
but
the
requirement
in
the
house
bill
that
the
acquisition
actually
take
place
is
too
restrictive.
so
we'll
simply
eliminate
that.
and
so
what
they
came
up
with
was
as
i
say
just
this
written
order
clause
requiring
that
there
be
some
kind
of
written
order
to
move
but
not
requiring
that
the
property
subsequently
be
taken.
now,
we
have
pointed
out
our
interpretation
of
the
written
order
clause
as
being
a
good
deal
narrower
than
the
position
that
the
plaintiffs
have
taken
in
respect
to
this.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
hud's
position
is
and
has
been
and
continues
to
be
consistent
with
the
recent
act
that
the
plaintiffs
have
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
we
attempt
to
limit
displacements
of
people
as
much
as
possible.
it's
clear
that
these
kinds
of
displacements
cause
terrible
hardship
and
there's
no
question
about
that
in
the
hardships
that
mr.
vanderstar
recited
at
the
beginning
of
the
hour.
we
certainly
acknowledged
that
this
is
a
serious
social
problem
and
one
which
hud
has
tried
to
address
by
restricting
displacements
as
much
as
possible.
but
the
problem
is
that
many
of
these
housing
projects
were
built
30
or
40
years
ago.
they
are
in
deteriorating
condition
and
some
of
them
are
beyond
rehabilitation
in
any
practical
sense.
so
that
occasionally,
these
properties
do
have
to
be
basically
torn
down
that
rehabilitation
really
would
amount
to
simply
rebuilding
from
the
ground
up.
so
there
are
people
that
do
get
displace.
and
our
contention
is
simply
that
this
act
which
is
intended
to
address
the
problem
of
acquisitions
of
property
does
not
cover
cases
in
which
people
are
displaced
from
property
that
is
already
owned
by
federal
agency.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
believe
mr.
justice
stevens
that
that
was
under
the
general
authority
of
the
housing
act.
that
has
been
a
problem
throughout
for
hud
is
to
try
to
figure
out
where
under
what
statute
defined
authority
for
these
kinds
of
payments.
it
was
not
under
the
relocation
act.
there
are
provisions
under
the
housing
act
in
which
basically
certain
funds
can
be
expended
on
emergency
basis
and
this
as
i
understand
it
was
deemed
to
be
one
of
those
cases.
but
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
was
simply
going
to
point
out
that
that
money
was
given
to
those
people
who
were
current
in
their
rents
and
it
was
an
attempt
and
an
accommodation
that
we
may
find
through
further
legislation,
we
may
find
some
kind
of
more
explicit
statutory
authority
for
but
right
now,
the
authority
is
rather
vague.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
there
are
several
different
points
on
this
core
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
first
is
as
to
the
statute,
the
new
statute.
there
is
a
statute
which
has
instructed
that
hud
will
try
to
reduce
displacements
as
much
as
possible
and
that
there
will
be
a
report
which
the
secretary
will
issue
in
january
which
will
indicate
what
the
secretary
is
doing
about
the
problem
of
displacements.
well,
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
that
was
enacted
in,
i
think
it
was
signed
october
31st.
right.
but
that
essentially
is
just
a
restatement
of
hud
policy.
hud
policy
clearly
is
to
limit
the
displacement
as
much
possible.
it
doesn't
provide
new
statutory
authority
for
these
kinds
of
payments.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
and
we
believe
that
it
doesn't,
that
that
statute
does
not
in
any
way
moot
this
case
or
render
at
less
importance
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
there
are
as
i
said
cases
in
which
hud
has
to
displace
people.
those
cases
will
simply
won't
change
by
virtue
of
directive
to
hud
to
limit
the
kind
of
the
number
of
displacements
a
much
as
possible
where
they
have
to
be
made,
they
are
going
to
be
made.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
a
much
broader
issues
here
which
is
that
this
statute
applies
not
just
to
hud
but
to
all
federal
agencies
and
it
applies
in
addition
to
all
state
agencies
that
are
obtaining
assistance
by
federally
financed
programs
or
projects.
so
we're
not
just
talking
about
something
that
affects
hud.
we're
talking
about
something
that
affects
every
state
agency
that
is
acquiring
property
or
by
the
plaintiffs'
interpretations
that
owns
property
and
that
it
decides
to
dispose
of
in
some
other
way
and
when
that
decision
to
dispose
of
the
property
results
in
people
being
displaced.
if
there
are
no
questions,
