hear
arguments
next
in
wilson
against
omaha
indian
tribe
and
the
consolidated

it
takes
a
little
time
for
the
audience
to
clear,
mr.
smith.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
mr.
smith.
chief

mr.
cullison.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
what
use
was
the
land
put
at
the
time
you
described
as
its
having
been
invaded
and
occupied?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
veeder,
we'll
not
ask
you
to
split
your
argument
for
three
minutes
if
you'll
be
prepared
to
go
on
at
1:00.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
veeder,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
on
this
river
or
on
this
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
give
us
the
page,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
27?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
a
few
minutes
ago
essentially
what
this
sentence
embraces,
namely
that
the
land
was
washed
away.
now,
were
you
stating
that
as
an
affirmative
fact
or
were
you
quoting
this
provision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
concede
that
it
was--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
tell
me--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
finish
your
response
and
then
i--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
under
state
law
or
federal
law
that
you
responded
to
mr.
justice
white,
if
i
understood
you,
that
when
the
evidence
is
evenly
balanced,
the
plaintiff
prevails?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
the
general
rule--
isn't
the
general
proposition
that
if
the
evidence
is
evenly
balanced,
the
plaintiff
hasn't
carried
the
necessary
preponderance--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and,
therefore,
the
plaintiff
fails.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you're
analyzing
the
proof.
the
assumption
of
his
question
i
thought--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
mine
is--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
if
the
evidence
is
evenly
balanced,
i
had
always
thought
for
a
number
of
years
that
the
defendant
prevails.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
it
is.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
beale.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
suggest
any
statutes
in
which
the
term
“indian”
has
been
construed
by
a
court
to
mean
many
indians
or
an
indian
tribe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
in
that
period,
congress
was
legislating
quite
regularly
on
indian's
rights,
indian
tribes,
indian
lands.
are
you
suggesting
that
they
used
the
term
“indian”
to
mean
all
these
things
that
you've
just
mentioned,
one
indian,
many
indians,
an
indian
tribe
which
is
a
corporate
entity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is--
that's
what
it
means.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
four
minutes
to
get
it
done.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
