mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
there's
anything
clear
throughout
the
history
of
the
federal
system,
it
is
that
the
tenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
require
application
of
local
law
and
not
federal
common
law
in
property
disputes,
unless
the
constitution
laws
of
the
united
states
otherwise
require.
this
was
the
rule
even
under
swift
v.
tyson.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
iowa
that
these
basic
principles
have
been
violated
in
this
case.
until
this
controversy
arose
in
1975,
title
was
settled
in
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
in
1975,
the
solicitor
for
the
united
states
department
of
interior
formed
the
erroneous
belief
that
the
land
in
this
case
was
cut
off
from
the
omaha
indian
reservation
by
a
re-channelization
project
with
the
united
states
core
of
engineers
during
the
1940s.
later,
in
1975,
the
tribe,
aided
by
the
united
states
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
invaded
the
land
and
occupied
it.
against
this
factual
backdrop,
the
united
states
commenced
action
to
quiet
title
to
the
land
as
trustee
for
the
omaha
indian
tribe.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
it
was--
a
portion
of
it
claimed
by
the
state
of
iowa,
your
honor,
was
used
for
a
wildlife
refuge.
the
remaining
portion
of
the
land
was
under
cultivation
by
the
other
petitioners
in
the
case
and
the
tribe,
in
its
own
behalf,
at
bureau
of
indian
affairs
commenced
a
separate
action
to
quiet
title
to
the
same
land
an
additional
8,000
acres
in
the
same
locality.
after
trial,
lasting
about
six
weeks,
the
state
of
iowa
and
the
other
petitioners
it
proved,
without
the
aid
of
any
presumptions,
that
the
indian
land
in
this
locality,
which
was
in
the
path
of
missouri
river,
washed
away
more
than
a
century
ago
and
that
this
land
is
new
land
formed
on
the
iowa
side
of
the
river.
on
the
appeal
to
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
it
was
held
that
federal
interest
required
application
of
federal
common
law
of
avulsion
drastically
different
from
local
law,
as
well
as
previously
recognized
federal
law.
by
extrapolating
from
two
court
of
appeals
decisions
involving
interstate
boundaries,
this
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
a
sudden
and
unusual
jump
of
the
thalweg
within
the
bed
of
a
river
or
over
as
well
as
around
land,
whether
it's
submerged
or
not,
invokes
the
doctrine
of
avulsion.
these
events
would
be
difficult
to
prove
at
the
time
they
occurred.
but,
the
court
of
appeals
cast
the
burden
upon
iowa
and
the
other
petitioners
in
this
case
to
prove
they
did
not
occur
more
than
a
century
ago.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
your
honor,
they
used
that--
the
two
court
of
appeals
cases
involving
interstate
boundaries
to
reach
this
result,
and
we
contend
that
they,
even
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
so,
and
i
think
that
identifle--
identifiable
land
in
place
is
also
a
rudimentary
and
important
concept
in
this
law
of
avulsion
that's
also
found
in
that
case.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
state
of
iowa
and
the
other
petitioners
in
this
case
fail
to
sustain
this
impossible
burden
and,
therefore,
it
reversed
the
trial
court
in
order
that
title
to
the
land
be
quieted
in
the
omaha
indian
tribe
and
in
the
united
states
as
trustee.
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
respondents
argue
that
it's
required
in
this
case
decision
in
oneida
indian
nation
v.
county
of
oneida.
the
issue
before
this
court
in
that
case
was
whether
there
was
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
28
united
states
code
1331
and
1332.
it
was
alleged
by
the
petitioners
in
that
case
that
a
conveyance
of
tribal
land
to
the
state
of
new
york
without
the
consent
of
the
united
states
government
violated
the
federal
non-intercourse
act.
clearly,
a
violation
of
the
non-intercourse
act
was
alleged
and
this
court
properly
held
that
there
was
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
it
was
the
united
states
title
in
the
land
in
dispute,
the
indian
title
to
land
in
dispute.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
concerning
the
propriety
of
federal
jurisdiction.
in
oneida,
this
court
went
on
to
discuss
federal
government's
continuing
interest
in
protecting
the
aboriginal
title
to
indians
in
their
reservation
land.
whatever
the
effect
of
this
language
is,
it
is
distinguishable
from
the
case
at
bar.
in
this
case,
the
question
is
not
whether
the
state
of
iowa
and
the
other
petitioners
here
seek
to
extinguish
indian
title
to
their
aboriginal
lands
in
violation
of
a
federal
statute
because
the
indian's
possession
of
the
land
was
extinguished
by
the
physical
action
of
the
missouri
river
over
a
century
ago.
the
question
here
is
whether
indian
land
is
affected
by
the
same
law
of
accretion
and
avulsion
that
uniformly
affects
the
property
rights
of
the
state
of
iowa
and
the
other
peti--
riparian
owners
in
this
same
locality.
united
states
v.
oklahoma
gas
company
is
more
pertinent.
in
that
case,
the
question
before
this
court
was
whether
the
federal
authority
to
construct
a
highway
through
tribal
land,
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
government,
included
the
right
to
erect
electrical
transmission
lines.
this
court
held
that
a
conveyance
by
the
united
states
of
land
which
it
owns
beneficially
for
indians
is
to
be
construed
according
to
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
land
lies,
unless
an
expressed
congressional
intention
to
the
contrary
is
shown.
the
court
pointed
out
application
of
different
federal
law
was
not
necessary
to
protect
the
indians
from
their
own
improvidence
or
from
overreaching
by
others.
the
court
pointed
out
the
same
law
applied
to
indians
and
to
non-indians
alike.
the
court
continued
with
the
observation
that
oklahoma
is
spotted
with
restricted
lands
held
in
trust
for
indian
lotees.
complications
and
confusion
would
follow
from
applying
rules
differing
from
those
which
obtain
as
to
lands
of
non-indians
and
that
the
court
believes
that
if
the
congress
had
intended
this,
they
would
have
made
its
meaning
clear.
exactly
that
same
reasoning
is
applicable
in
this
case.
so,
the
fundamental
issue
to
be
decided
by
this
court
is
whether
federal
interest
requires
application
of
new
federal
common
law
radically
different
from
local
law
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondents
argue
that
it
is
required
because
the
case
involves
an
interstate
boundary
and
because
there
is
a
special
interest
of
the
united
states
government
in
protecting
reservation
lands.
both
of
these
contentions
are
incorrect.
there
is
no
interstate
boundary
involved
in
this
case.
the
boundary
between
iowa
and
nebraska
was
fixed
by
a
compact
in
1943.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
then--
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
then
that
would
be
a
question
of
federal
law
to
be
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
at
that
time.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
that's
irrelevant
in
this
case
because,
now,
there
is
an
interstate
boundary
and
for
the
additional
reason
that
the
only
issue
that
the
location
of
the
boundary
could
have
any
relevance
to
the
case
would
be
in
choice
of
law
between
iowa
and
nebraska
in
case
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
law
of
iowa
and
nebraska.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
that's
very
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
only
relevance
of
the
location
of
the
boundary
in
this
case
would
be
in
the
choice
of
law
where
there's
a
conflict
between
the
law
of
iowa
and
the
law
of
nebraska.
and,
any
conflict
that
there
is
between
the
law
of
iowa
and
the
law
of
nebraska
was
resolved
in
favor
of
the
respondents
when
the
court
chose
nebraska
law
in
deciding
the
case.
and,
for
that
reason,
the
location
of
the
boundary
now
or
the
location
of
the
boundary
before
1943
has
no
relevance
to
this
case
and
it's
our
contention
that
any
cases--
federal
cases
that
relate
to
interstate
boundaries
have
no
application
here.
also,
there
is
no
special
interest
of
the
united
states
government
in
protecting
the
aboriginal
rights
of
the
omaha
indian
tribe
in
this
case
either
because
the
tribe
was
denied
possession
of
this
land
a
century
ago
by
the
physical
action
of
the
missouri
river
and
not
by
any
action
involving
the
state
of
iowa
or
these
petitioners.
the
same
law
applies
to
the
omaha
indian
tribe
as
applies
to
the
other
riparian
owners
in
the
same
locality.
there
is
no
need
in
this
case
to
protect
the
tribe
from
its
own
improvidence
or
overreaching
by
others
because
there
is
none
involved
here.
the
local
law
is
uniform
in
its
application
to
indians
and
to
indians--
non-indians
alike.
and,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
and
no
reason
why
the
interest
of
the
united
states
government
in
the
omaha
indian
tribe
and
its
tribal
lands
cannot
be
readily
and
equally
protected
according
to
state
property
laws.
and--
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
or
should
be
any
different
in
local
law--
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
unless
it's
shown
that
there's
some
discrimination
or
there's
some
interference
with
a
federal
interest
that
is
important
or
unless
it's
required
by
some
federal
need
or
some
federal
policy
that
local
law
should
apply.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
right.
we
contend
that
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
should
be
overruled,
reversed,
and
that
the
trial
court's
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
i
believe
that--
mr.
george
bennett
cullison,
jr.
i
believe
the
constitutional
problem
that
was
raised
with
respect
to
different
types
of
people
do
not
apply
to
the
state,
that
you
still
can--
that,
still,
it
does
not
apply
to
the
state
of
iowa
regardless
of
whether--
of
the
constitutional
problems
of
distinguishing
or
making
distinctions
between
blacks
and
whites
and
caucasian
and
orientals.
that,
still,
the--
there
are
more
constitutional
problems
raised
by
including
the
state
of
iowa
as
a
white
person
than
there
are
by--
avoided
by
interpreting
the
award
to
mean
“only
non-indians.”
thank
you.
