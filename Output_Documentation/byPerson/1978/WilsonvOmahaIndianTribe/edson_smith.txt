mr.
edson
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
suit
amounts
to
a
suit
to
quiet
title
to
about
2,900
acres
of
land
lying
on
the
east
bank
of
the
missouri
river
in
iowa,
about
30
miles
south
of
sioux
city.
the
plaintiffs
are
the
omaha
indian
tribe
in
the
united
states
as
trustee
for
the
tribe,
and
they
are
the
respondents
here.
the
defendants
are
the
record
title
holders
of
the
land.
they
are
counterclaimants.
they
are
three
individuals,
a
corporation,
and
the
state
of
iowa,
and
they
are
the
petitioners
here.
i
represent
wilson
and
others.
mr.
cullison
will
speak
for
the
state
of
iowa.
directly
west
of
this
area,
across
the
river
in
nebraska,
is
the
omaha
indian
reservation.
it
is
established
there
pursuant
to
a
treaty
of
1854
with
the
router
as
its
boundary
on
the
east.
mr.
edson
smith
that's
a
typographical
error.
mr.
edson
smith
it
should
be
“east.”
it's
a
typographical
error.
mr.
edson
smith
it
should
be
“east.”
mr.
edson
smith
it's
been
on
the
east
bank,
for
48
years
at
least,
and
some
of
it
for
85
years.
the
--
when
the
reservation
was
surveyed
in
1867
by
t.h.
barrett
for
the
general
land
office,
this
area
of
latitude
or
longitude,
or
under
the
sky,
as
they
sometimes
say,
was
occupied
by
a
kind
of
peninsula
extending
eastward
from
nebraska
toward
iowa,
between
the
upper
and
the
lower
limbs
of
the
blackbird
bend
and
so
much
of
it,
at
least
as
was
above
the
ordinary
high
water
mark,
was
part
of
the
omaha
reservation.
mr.
edson
smith
yes,
on
the
back
of
the
white
appendix,
there
is
a
drawing,
a
map,
of
this
area
and,
there,
it
shows
the
present
river.
it
shows
the
iowa-nebraska
state
boundary
which
was
fixed
by
compact
between
the
states
in
1943.
it
shows
the
retracement
of
the
barrett
meander
of
the
nebraska
shore
of
this
peninsula
of
1867.
mr.
edson
smith
that's
right,
but
they
--
the
one
i'm
referring
to
is
on
the
back
sh--
cover,
attached
to
the
back
cover.
mr.
edson
smith
of
the
white
appendix.
mr.
edson
smith
yes.
mr.
edson
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
the
--
mr.
edson
smith
yes,
there
--
actually,
there
are
copies
of
the
same
map
in
several
other
places
in
briefs
and
so
forth,
but
that's
the
one
i've
referred
to.
the
irregular
line
there,
which
is
northeast
and
south
of
the
barrett,
the
retracement
of
the
barrett
survey
line
is
the
iowa
high
bank.
the
land
inside
that
barrett
survey
retracement,
bounded
on
the
west
by
the
iowa-nebraska
state
boundary
and
on
the
other
sides
by
the
retracement
is
what
we
call
in
this
case
barrett
survey
area,
and
it's
part
of
the
larger
lowland
area,
also
bounded
on
the
west
by
the
state
boundary
but
on
the
other
sides
by
the
iowa
high
bank
which
has
been
called
the
blackbird
bend
area.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
the
state
of
--
the
united
states,
as
trustee
for
the
tribe
--
indian
omaha
tribe,
claim
that
this
land,
now
on
the
iowa
bank
of
the
river,
is
there
by
reason
of
a
avulsive
actions
of
the
river
and
that
it's
part
of
the
reservation.
the
defendant,
state
of
iowa,
claims
part
of
it
as
secretion
to
the
bed
of
the
river,
part
of
the
bed
owned
by
the
state,
and
iowa
and
the
other
defendants
claim
there
is
though
the
secretion
to
iowa
riparian
land,
that's
between
iowa
and
the
defendants
lake
and
wilson
and
rgp

and
the
conflicting
claims
are
settled
by
those
defendants
giving
iowa

i've
referred
to,
your
honor.
it's
--
mr.
edson
smith
yes,
iowa
claims
part
of
this
land
as
secretion
to
the
east
half
of
the
bed
of
the
river
which
iowa
owned,
and
the
rest
of
it
is
claimed
by
iowa
and
the
other
defendants
as

to
iowa
riparian
land.
actually,

the
other
defendants

through

and
iowa
claims
through
the
other
defendants
also
by
reason
of
the
quick-claim
deeds
to
iowa
and
the
quiet
title
action
decrees
in
favor
of
those
other
defendants.
the
district
court
placed
the
burden
of
proof
upon
the
plaintiffs
to
prove
their
complaints
and
upon
the
defendants
to
prove
their
counterclaims.
the
court
found
that
the
plaintiffs
had
failed
to
sustain
their
burden
but
that
the
defendants
had
proved
that
this
land
is
secretion
to
iowa
riparian
land
and,
accordingly,
the
district
court
quieted
title
in
the
defendants.
mr.
edson
smith
applying
--
the
district
court
held
the
law
of
nebraska
was
applicable.
mr.
edson
smith
i
think
--
mr.
edson
smith
yes.
mr.
edson
smith
that's
correct.
their
presumption
is
definitely
in
favor
of
secretion
in
iowa
and
nebraska
hasn't
really
passed
on
that
question.
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
and
said
that
--
directed
a
decree
quieting
title
in
the
plaintiffs
in
so
much
of
this
barrett
survey
area
as
was
trust
land.
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
the
evidence
did
not
prove
either
avulsion
or
accretion,
but
that
the
evidence
was
conjectural
--
too
conjectural
and
the
trial
court's
decree
too
speculative
to
sustain
the
defendants'
burden
under
section
194
of
25
united
states
code,
which
purports
to
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
white
person
in
a
trial
about
the
right
of
property
where
an
indian
is
a
party
on
the
other
side.
the
court's
decision
in
that
respect
was
further
influenced
by
its
decision
to
apply
federal
rather
than
state
common
law
of
accretion
and
avulsion
and
by
it
peculiar
version
of
state
common
law,
under
which,
there
may
be
an
avulsion
without
any
fast
land
being

mr.
edson
smith
yes,
that's
right.

i
say

i'm
sorry.
federal
law,
yes.
its
peculiar
version
of
federal
law
under
which
it's
not
necessary
in
order
to
have
an
avulsion
that
there'd
be
any
fast
land
severed
from
one
bank
of
the
river
and
becoming
attached
to
the
other
and
if
there
may
be
an
avulsion
within
the
bed
of
this
river,
that
is,
over
where
the
stowage
of
the
river
moves
over
or
around
a
piece
of
shore
or
a
sandbar
and
that
it's
not
necessary
in
order
to
have
an
avulsion
that
the
river
abandoned
its
own
bed
and
seek
a
new
one.
it
can
all
happen
within
the
bed.
wilson's
petition
for
certiorari
listed
five
questions
for
review.
this
court
granted
certiorari
but
limited
to
two
of
those
questions.
first,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
so
construing
section
194
as
to
make
it
applicable
in
this
case
and,
second,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
applying
federal
rather
than
state
common
law
of
accretion
and
avulsion
to
this
case.
i
intend
to
cover
the
first
point
of
the
construction
of
section
194
and
mr.
cullison
will
devote
his
attention
to
the
question
of
the
state
or
federal
law.
there
are
five
groups
of
words
in
--
mr.
edson
smith
you
didn't
grant
certiorari
on
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
edson
smith
we
hoped
you
would,
but
we
were
disappointed.
there
are
just
those
two
questions
presented.
in
section
194,
you'll
find
five
groups
of
words
that
are
misconstrued,
we
say.
coincidentally,
section
194
is
printed
on
page
2
of
the
wilson
principle
brief.
it's
part
of
the
1834
indian
non-intercourse
which
is
printed
in
full
in
the
buff-covered
appendix,
beginning
at
page
190
with
section
22,
which
is
the
present
section
194
printed
at
page
199.
first
group
of
words
that
calls
for
construction
there
are
“any
indian”
and
“the
indian”
and
“himself,”
referring
to
an
indian.
the
court
of
appeals
construed
“an
indian”
to
mean
an
indian
tribe,
but
it
takes
more
than
one
indian
to
make
a
tribe.
the
united
states
sues,
in
this
case,
as
trustee
for
the
omaha
tribe,
not
for
its
individual
members.
the
omaha
tribe
is
a
corporation
it's
a
legal
entity,
separate
and
distinct
from
its
members.
it
sues
for
itself,
not
for
its
members.
it
claims
this
land
as
tribal
land.
the
congress
knew
how
to
describe
indians
separate
from
tribes
or
going
to
the
section
to
apply
to
the
indians
and
not
to
the
tribes,
to
describe
tribes
separately
from
indians
who
are
going
to
this
section
to
apply
to
tribes
and
not
indians,
and
to
describe
both
at
the
same
time
when
they're
going
to
the
section
to
apply
both
is
perfectly
apparent
from
the
30
sections
of
this
1834
act.
where
it
wanted
them
to
apply
to
both,
it
used
appropriate
language
such
as
“any
indian
or
indian
tribe,”
used
that
expression
in
a
number
of
times.
section
194
makes
its
first
appearance
on
the
statute
books
in
the
1822
indian
non-intercourse
act.
but,
there,
the
difference
was
that
the
plural
was
used,
“indians.”
that
was
changed
to
singular
in
the
1834
act.
if,
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
indian
is
plural,
it
could
be
construed
to
include
an
indian
tribe.
certainly,
changing
that
to
singular
would
preclude
any
such
option.
mr.
edson
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
opposition
says
that
this
change
was
a
mere
change
of
--
to
correct
syntax
and
make
it
the
same
in
both
places,
but
if
they
wanted
to
correct
the
syntax
and
make
it
mean
plural,
they
could
just
as
well
have
changed
the
later
word
there
to
plural
from
singular
and
that
would've
had
the
same
effect
if
the
congress
chose
to
change
the
plural
to
singular,
rather
than
to
change
the
singular
to
plural.
mr.
edson
smith
no,
that's
not
right
here,
your
honor.
i
think
if
they
are
--
mr.
edson
smith
individual
indians
--
if
there's
two
individual
indians
suing
one
white
person,
the
statute
would
--
on
its
face,
would
apply.
mr.
edson
smith
or
three,
but
this
is
--
mr.
edson
smith
well,
if
it's
--
mr.
edson
smith
if
each
one
is
suing
for
itself,
but
if
it's
an
organized
group
--
mr.
edson
smith
that's
a
different
point,
yes.
mr.
edson
smith
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
plural
would
be
--
could
be
construed
to
include
a
tribe,
but
--
mr.
edson
smith
each
individual
indian
would
--
mr.
edson
smith
that's
right.
mr.
edson
smith
well,
as
i
say,
i
don't
think--
even
in
the
1822
act,
i
don't
think
that
could
be
properly
construed
to
include
a
tribe
or
the
plural
is
used,
but
i
say
if,
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
it
could
be.
certainly,
when
it
was
changed
to
the
singular,
it
would
be
even
less
possible
to
construe
it
as
a
tribe.
mr.
edson
smith
well,
if
it's
a
matter
of
the
individual
rights
by,
i
would
say,
one
could
see
for
the
class,
but
here,
as
i
pointed
out,
this
is
not
because
he
brought
four
individual
indians
by
the
tribe.
it's
a
suit
brought
by
the
tribe
for
itself,
involving
tribal
land,
not
a
lot
of
indian
lands
and,
certainly
“an
indian,”
as
i
say,
it
takes
more
than
one
indian
to
make
a
tribe.
in
1834,
the
courts
were
holding
that
tribes
could
not
sue
or
be
sued
in
federal
court,
and
that
might
be
one
reason
why
congress
didn't
give
the
tribes
the
burden
of
proof
advantage
that
section
194
purports
to
give
to
s--
individual
indians,
why
give
a
burden
of
proof
advantage
to
a
party
that
couldn't
come
into
court?
the
next
group
of
words
that
i
want
to
talk
about
are
“a
white
person.”
according
to
the
dictionary,
a
white
person
is
a
member
of
the
caucasian
race,
but
the
corporate-defendant
here
is
not
a
caucasian.
the
state
of
iowa
is
not
a
caucasian.
the
individual--
as
to
the
individuals,
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
whether
they're--
what
their
color
or
what
their
race
is.
here,
again,
the
language
of
the
30
sections
of
the
1834
act
demonstrates
that
congress
knew
how
to
describe
non-indians
and,
incidentally,
the
court
of
appeals
construed
a
white
person
to
mean
all
non-indians,
but
where
congress
wanted
to
describe
all
non-indians
and
use
such
expressions
as
“any
person
other
than
an
indian.”
in
section
16
of
the
1834
act,
the
word
“white
person”
is
used
and,
with
respect
to
that
section,
this
court
held
in
united
states
versus
perryman
in
1880
that
“white
person”
does
not
mean
all
non-indians
and
it
does
not
include
a
negro.
judge
bogue,
the
trial
judge,
held
that
section
194
would
not
be
applicable
in
this
case
because
the--
in
order
to
trigger
its
application,
the
indian
must
first
make
the
showing
of
previous
possession
or
ownership
of
the
land
involved
and
that,
if
the
indian
could
show
previous
possession
or
ownership,
he
would
be
showing
an
avulsion
and,
if
he
made
that
proof,
he
wouldn't
have
to
have
section
194
because
he'd
already
proved
his
case.
judge
bogue
held
that
this
land
was
accretion
to
the
iowa
riparian
land
and,
as
such,
that
it
is
not
the
same
land
that
the
indian
owned
or
possessed
in
1867.
it
is
new
and
different
land,
deposited
against
the
iowa
bank
by
the
river
by
bringing
down
and
moving
them
from
north
and
dropping
it
there.
mr.
edson
smith
it
does.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
begged
the
question.
it
assumed
the
existence--
mr.
edson
smith
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
i've
listed
here
five
different
groups
of
words
that
call
for
construction.
if
any--
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
in
any
one
of
those
five,
it
would
return
the
burden
of
proof
to
where
the
trial
court
put
it
on
each
party
to
prove
his
own
case.
the
final
clause
of
the
section
is
one
that
calls
for
construction.
it
reads
“whenever
the
indian
shall
make
out
a
presumption
of
title
in
himself
from
the
fact
of
previous
possession
or
ownership.”
the
court
of
appeals
construed
that
to
mean
that
the
indian
does
make
out
a
presumption
of
a
title
in
himself
if
he
shows
previous
possession
or
ownership.
mr.
edson
smith
if
he
shows
an
avulsion--
mr.
edson
smith
if
it
is
an
avulsion,
yes.
mr.
edson
smith
yes.
here--
mr.
edson
smith
not
just--
mr.
edson
smith
with
reference
to
the
“under
the
sky,”
the--
mr.
edson
smith
but
the
area
under
the
sky--
mr.
edson
smith
but
not
the
present
land.
mr.
edson
smith
well,
it
doesn't
say
“area
under
the
sky.”
the
statute
says--
mr.
edson
smith
“previous
ownership
or
possession--“
mr.
edson
smith
of
the
land
in
controversy.
mr.
edson
smith
that's
right.
mr.
edson
smith
well,
it
says
in--
it
says
“property”--
mr.
edson
smith
in
all
trials
with
respect
to
property,
and
the
implication
of
--
mr.
edson
smith
“previous
possession
or
ownership”
is
--
mr.
edson
smith
this
particular
area,
yes,
but
not
the
property
that's
in
that
particular
area
now.
mr.
edson
smith
well,
if
it's
this
property,
why,
then
that's
one
thing.
if
it's
other
property
formerly
occupying
that
area
under
the
sky,
that's
something
else
again.
but,
the
point
i
was
about
to
make
with
regard
to
that
clause
is
that,
even
assuming
that
it's
the
same
property,
the
court
of
appeals
here
assumed
that
the
indian
would
make
out
the
presumption
of
present
title
simply
by
showing
previous
possession
or
ownership.
and,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
that
doesn't
follow
because
“whenever”
doesn't
mean
“always”
and
“whenever”
calls
into
application
here
the
presumption
of
a
continuance
of
the
existence
of
a
condition
or
state
of
facts,
and
that's
a
presumption
that
is
not
applied
in
all
cases
but
only
where
the
circumstances
are
such
as
to
show
the
likelihood
of
the
continuation
of
that
state
of
facts
or
condition.
and,
in
this
case,
the
con--
the
circumstances
are
such
that
the
indian
couldn't
possibly
make
out
a
presumption
of
ownership
because
the
land
has
been
on
the
iowa
side
of
the
river
for
48--
85
years.
the
defendants
and
their
predecessors,
their
title,
have
been
in
possession
of
it
for
at
least
40
years
and
they've
cultivated
it,
leveled
it.
they've
cleared
with
the
trees.
they've
put
in
loads
in
culverts.
they
had
such
possession
as
to
give
them
title
by
adverse
possession
four
times
over
because
the
statute
of
limitations
of
iowa
and
nebraska
both
are
10
years
if
those
statutes
applied.
they
don't
apply
and
they
still
have
strong
presumption
which
would
be
the
basis
of
application
of
those
statues
to
which
they
apply.
under
those
circumstances,
the
indians
could
not
make
out
a
presumption
of
title
in
himself.
finally,
on
this
subject,
the
words
“burden
of
proof”
themselves
call
for
construction.
that
is
an
ambiguous
turn
that
has
two
meanings.
it
may
mean
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence.
it
may
mean
risk
of
a
non-persuasion.
the
court
of
appeals
construed
it
to
mean
risk
of
non-persuasion
and
that,
so
interpreted,
it
makes
out
of
section
194
an
invidious
racial
discrimination.
it
takes
the
right
person's
property
and
gives
it
to
the
indian
solely
on
the
basis
of
race
construing
it,
however,
to
mean
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence.
it
has
no
such
devastating
effect
on
the
white
person's
rights
and
such
a
construction
could
save
the
constitutionality
of
the
statue
for
whatever
that's
worth.
mr.
edson
smith
well,
then
i
think
that's--
mr.
edson
smith
well,
it
certainly
does,
your
honor.
of
course,
we
--
mr.
edson
smith
well,
i
think
the
discrimination
between
indians
and
non-indians
of
this
sort
would
still
be
an
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
edson
smith
i
am
unaware
of
the
mancarry
case--
mr.
edson
smith
i
--
that's
the
point
that
was
raised
in
the
briefs
of
the
--
mr.
edson
smith
solicitor
general,
yes.
i
think
that
might
be
true
but
i
disagree
that
discrimination
between
white
persons
and
indians
is
not
an
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
edson
smith
i'm
aware
that
mancarry--
mr.
edson
smith
i'm
not--
mr.
edson
smith
i'm
not
clear
on
that,
your
honor,
in
this
mancarry
case.
mr.
edson
smith
the
court
held
there
could
be
a
discrimination
in
--
mr.
edson
smith
in
employment
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
giving
--
mr.
edson
smith
not
favoring
all
indians,
favoring
just
those
indians
that
are
tribal
indians
living
on
the
reservation
or
whatever
it
takes
to
be
a
tribal
indian.
and,
the
purpose
of
that
discrimination,
according
to
this
court,
was
to
help
indians
develop
self-government
and
so
forth.
now,
there's
no
such
background
for
discrimination
of
that
sort
in
this
c--
in
this
section
194,
and
the
court
said
it
was
not--
in
those
circumstances,
it
was
not
an
invidious
discrimination.
here,
i
think
it
is
an
invidious
discrimination.
i
don't
think
it's
comparable
to
the--
mr.
edson
smith
alright,
i
didn't
quite
follow.
mr.
edson
smith
well,
according
to
the--
that
argument,
if
they
were
from
nigeria
or
china
and
they
were
discriminated
against
as
between
them
and
white
persons,
the
--
that
would
make
the
section
unconstitutional,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
it's
equally
unconstitutional
where
it's
simply
discrimination
of
this
sort
between
an
indian
and
a
white
person.
mr.
edson
smith
that's
fair.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edson
smith
well,
that's
--
if
this
was
the
only
point
in
the
construction
of
the
section,
yes,
it
will
be
possible
to
go
back
and
prove
that
some
are
white
and
some
are
other
and
--
mr.
edson
smith
so,
there
might
be
a
difference
which--
mr.
edson
smith
we
made
a
constitutional
argument
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
your
honor.
mr.
edson
smith
in
our
brief,
we
tried
to
confined
our
arguments
to
the
--
mr.
edson
smith
the
construction
of
the
statute,
yes,
because--
mr.
edson
smith
that
was
all
that
this
court
granted
certiorari
on.
we--
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
one--
mr.
edson
smith
but
you
didn't--
actually,
on
the
constitutionality,
you
have
up--
held
up
the
petition
for
certiorari
of
one
of
the
other
defendants
which
raises
the
constitutionality
question,
along
with
ours.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
