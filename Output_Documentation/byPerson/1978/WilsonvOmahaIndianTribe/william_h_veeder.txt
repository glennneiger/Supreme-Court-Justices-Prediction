mr.
william
h.
veeder
you're
very
kind,
your
honor.
thank
you.
[luncheon
break]
mr.
william
h.
veeder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
unique
case
that
is
here
for
review
for
several
reasons.
we've
heard
complaints
this
morning
that
the
appellate
court
had
applied
25
usc
194
to
them
and
that
they
had
the
burden
of
proof
by
reason
of
that
statute.
the
fact
is
that
they
are
complaining
about
a
statute
that
applied
the
burden
of
proof
that
they
voluntarily
assumed
themselves
because
they
had
no
other
course
to
pursue.
they
pleaded
and
spent
days
trying
to
prove
that
the
blackbird
bend
had
been
washed
away
by
action
of
missouri
river
and
that
it
had
been
restored
by
accretions
to
the
iowa
bank,
and
they
failed.
they
failed
totally
and
completely
and
entirely
in
the
effort
to
make
the
proof
that
they
are
now
complaining
about.
they
pleaded
in
their
answers
and
they
undertook
to
prove,
and
that's
the
only
defense
that
they
had
to
the
omaha
indian
tribe's
complaint,
the
only
defense
they
had
was
that
the
river
had
washed
away
this--
the
lands
and
that
they
had
been
restored
by
accretions.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
yes?
mr.
william
h.
veeder
that's
right.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
the
united
states
of
america
filed,
and,
incidentally,
i
have
a
large
map
here
that
might
be
of
help
to
the
court,
i
don't
know
whether
what
locations
are
important.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
yes.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
i
will.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
the
united
states
filed
the
first
complaint.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
and
it
related
to
this
land
that
is
in
pink.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
not
really,
your
honor.
the
pleas
were
simply
that
the
2,900
acres--
the
title
of
the
2,900
acres
resided
an
omaha
indian
tribe
and
that
that
land
is
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
of
america.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
that's
correct
and
we
certainly
proved
the--
we
offered
our
prima
facie
case
and
we
proved
that
these
lands
were
originally
part
of
the
omaha
indian
reservation,
we
offered
the
treaty,
we
offered
the
1867
barrett
survey
showing
concisely
and
precisely
where
those
2,900
acres
were
situated
and
that,
in
1867,
the
river
flowed
around
that
land.
and,
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
that
was
a
prima
facie
case,
but
may
i
take
one--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
that's
“under
the
sky.”
we've
proved
that
those
lands
were
part
of
the
omaha
indian
reservation
in
1854.
we've
proved
that
there
are
surveys
in
1867.
we've
proved
that
they
are
occupied
by
the
indians
until
at
some
time
between
the
1920s.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
yes.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
yes,
those
were--
that
was
surveyed
by
barry--
by
barrett
and
it
was
entirely
a
federal
united
states
congressional
survey--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
your
honor--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
well,
your
honor,
we--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that's--
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
that
is
a
very
simplified
situation
that
you
have
described.
this
is
a
very
large
track
of
land.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
it's
in
oxbow.
it
was--
it's
encompassed
within,
and
may
i
retract
just
a
moment.
the
department
of
justice
case
relates
to
the
land
that's
there
in
pink
that
you
can
see.
the--
that's
2,900
acres.
the
department
of--
the
omaha
tribe
involves
6,000
acres
of
land.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
no,
it
isn't.
they
just
cut
the
heart
out
of
it,
2,900
acres
in
the
middle.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
but
what
i'm
saying
that
it
is
very
simplistic
to
say
that,
normally,
the
rule
is
that
the
accretions,
that
is
the
presumption
of
accretions,
as--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
that's
not
the
situation
here,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
it
is--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
i
really
think,
on
this
river,
it
is
wrong.
i
think,
on
this
river,
there
is
no
way--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
on
the
missouri
river
and
this
situation.
the
factual
situation
is
very,
very
simply
this.
the
river,
from
the
time
of
louis
and
clark,
was
flowing
around
that
oxbow--
that
bend.
the
oxbend--
bow
bend
moved
eastward
by
accretions
toward
1875.
in
1879,
there
was
a
drastic
change
in
the
course
of
the
river
but,
your
honor,
the
important
thing
here
is
that
the
burden
was
upon
these
defendants
to
prove
that
the
blackbird
bend
was
obliterated
and
entirely
washed
away
and
that
it
was
replaced
by
accretions.
that
is
their
pleading
here.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
up
to
the
point
where
there
is
an
affirmative
defense
interposed
and
this
is
the
point
that
is
controlling
here.
these
people
were
without
a
patent.
they
didn't
have
a
patent.
the
title
that
they
have
here
and
before
this
court,
including
the
state
of
iowa,
stems
from
a
trespass.
let's
start
with
that.
there's
no
conflict
here
about
doing
a
shift
of
the
bed
of
the
stream.
there
is
no
conflict
here
in
regard
to
the
ownership
of
islands
rising
on
the
bed
of
the
stream.
this
is
a
finite
case
of
a
right
claim
of
trespass
and
i--
going
ahead
right
now
on
this
point
in
regard
to
the
state
of
iowa,
we
have
put
into
this
record--
we
have
put
into
this
record
for
this
court
two
deeds
from
these
petitioners
to
the
state
of
iowa,
and
that's
the
only
claim
of
title
the
state
of
iowa
has,
is
two
deeds,
quick
claim
deeds
then
raining
back
to
a
man
named
joker
who,
in
1929,
entrust
us
upon
these
lands
and
says
you
quiet
title
to
them.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
yes,
but
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
united
states
nor
to
the
tribes.
they
have
a
very
tremendous
problem
here.
they
have
no
patents,
and
i
see
why
they
say
the
traced
the
land
to
ten
patents.
that
simply
is
untrue.
there
is
not
a
patent
in
the
chain
of
title.
we
checked
it
out
yesterday
again
because
i
didn't
want
to
say
it
if
it
isn't
true.
we
are
here
in
a
situation,
and
it's
an
extremely
important
situation,
where
we
pleaded
the
ownership.
the
tribe
pleaded
the
ownership
to
this
land
and
they
pleaded
back,
“yes,
we
admit
that
it,
one
time,
belonged
to
the
united
states
and
to
the
tribe
but
it
was
all
washed
away
and
entirely
replaced.”
that's
the
lawsuit
that's
in
this
court.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
that's
the--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
it's--
i've
got
it,
well,
marked
here,
your
honor.
in
every
one
of
them,
i
can
show
it
in
my
brief
a
whole
lot
simpler,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
footnote
50,
we
go
right
straight
down
the
line
and
we
trace
their
entire
title
showing
that
they
have
no
title
whatever
and
showing
the
source
of
their
title.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
i'll
get
it
right
now,
your
honor?
mr.
william
h.
veeder
we
started
on
page
25.
it's
25,
26,
and
27.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
of
my
brief.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
the
brief
of
the
trial.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
that's
right.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
and
their
affirmative
advances,
your
honor,
if
you
would
look
on
page,
of
my
brief,
30,
31,
32,
33,
we
see
allegations
in
their
answers.
they
admit
at
the
pages--
top
page
32,
your
honor,
they
say,
in
april
and
may,
they
admit
the
land
was
there.
that
it
existed
in
winona
county.
it
existed.
then,
they
say
down
there,
this
is
the
wilkinson--
wilson,
and
petitioner
wilson
says
“all
said
lands
used
to
set
iowa
and
nebraska
a
compact
line,
between
1867
and
1943,
was
eroded
away
by
actions
of
missouri
river
and
seized
to
exist
at
the
described
location,
having
been
washed
down
the
river.”
and
then
they
go
on,
“by
the--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
well,
your
honor,
yes.
they
admit
that
the
lands--
i
didn't
set
out
the
entire
petition.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
they
also
said
that
it
was
originally
situated
in
the
state
of
nebraska
and
it
was
under
the
treaty.
yes,
that's
the
original
statement,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
i'll
get
it,
your
honor.
well,
if
your
honor
would
turn
to
the
page
73
in
the--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
in
the
appendix.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
and
you
will
find
there
the
plaintiffs
had
admitted
that,
in
1867,
the
barrett
survey
was
made
to
describe
the
land.
it
said
they
existed
not
in
winona
county
but
within
the
border
of
the
state
of
nebraska.
it
said
the
land,
between
1867
and
184--93
were
eroded
away.
now,
that
is
reiterated
by
every
one
of
the
defendants,
including
the
state
of
iowa.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
that's
right
and,
your
honor,
to
go
back
to
the
original
question,
those
lands,
the
only
defense
they
had
was
that
there
o--
that
they
eroded
away
and
that
they
were
replaced.
now,
that's
an
affirmative--
that
is
an
affirmative
pleading
under
the
law--
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
iowa
why
they
had
to
assume
that
burden
of
proof
wholly
aside
from
25
usc
194.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
i
was
quoting
from
their
defenses.
they
said
the
land
is
all
washed
away
and--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
no,
your
honor.
our
affirmative--
our
proof
was
absolutely
to
the
contrary.
we
proved
that
that
land
was
never
washed
away
and,
in
our
brief,
we
set
out
five
plates,
the
only
official
maps
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
those
five
plates.
and,
you
will
find
that
those
lands
were
never
washed
away
and
we
proved
that.
but,
in
regard
to
a
question
that
justice
rehnquist
asked
earlier
this
morning
about
the
matter
of
accretions,
part
of
our
case
in
chief,
your
honor,
was
that
we
put
in
extensive
proof
that
there
were
no
accretions
before
we
finished
our
case
in
chief,
our
prima
facie
case,
we
showed
that
there
were
no
accretions.
first,
we
showed
the
land--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
well,
for
whatever
he
said,
the
district
court
simply
copied
the
petitioner's
pet--
findings,
verbatim,
with
all
the
mistakes
in
them
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals,
with
great
care,
went
through
this
transcript
in
detail
and
on
the
crucial
point
of
both
the
question
of
whether
the
lands
were
washed
away.
and
in
regard
to
the
matter
of
accretions,
the
court
of
appeals
said
with
great
specificity
that
the--
those
findings
were
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
i
can't--
which
one
now?
mr.
william
h.
veeder
the
first
one,
143?
mr.
william
h.
veeder
i
certainly
do,
your
honor.
i
certainly
think
that
there
was
no
departure
in
regard
to
the
issue
of
accretions
nor
would
i
want
to
be
a
party
to
it.
we
knew
the
obligation,
and
may
i
say
this,
we
tried
this
case
on
the
predicate
of
the
state
of
iowa
law.
i
don't
say
that
it's
applicable.
i
say
federal
law
is
applicable,
but
i
knew
very
well
the
burden
of
proof
under
the
circumstances,
and
we
proved
that
there
were
no
accretions.
we
have
proved
by
extensive
geology
and
soil
tests
that
there
were
no
accretions.
i
didn't
want
to
come
in
here
facing
a
presumption
that
we
haven't
overcome,
and
that
was
the
first
thing
we
did.
we
overcame
that
presumption
of
the
state
law.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
your
honor,
that's
an
extremely
difficult
case
because,
from
our
standpoint,
we
believe
the
primacy
of
federal
law
was
applicable
but,
i'll
say
this.
we
won
the
case
both
in
federal
and
state
law.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
i
hope
it
never
occurs,
but
i
think--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
i
think
the
only
thing
you
could
do
then
is
send
it
back
to
the
eighth
circuit
and
say
“hey,
did
they
win
on
the
basis
of
state
law?”
mr.
william
h.
veeder
well,
we
certainly
did.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
there's
no
question.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
proof
that
we
offered
using--
and
in
our
briefs
we're
very
explicit
on
that,
your
honor.
we
took
case
after
case
in
the
state
of
iowa,
why
the
burden
of
proof
with
these
people
and
we
proved
that
we
had
complied
with
the
state
law.
i--
we
didn't
have
to.
we
didn't
have
to
comply
with
state
law,
but
we
did
show
that
there
were
no
accretions
either
under
federal
law,
and
i
don't
think
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
the
matter
of
accretions
and
st--
between
the
two.
now,
it's
a
little
d--
more
difficult.
in
the
state
of
iowa,
the
accretions
have
to
atap--
attach
at
the
ordinary
high
water
mark.
that
is
a
real
problem.
he
applied
the
laws
in
nebraska
regions,
which
i
do
not
comprehend.
that's
the
trial
court.
but,
our
problem
was
made
very
simple.
we
never
had
to
get
the
question
on
the
avulsion
that
your
honor
raised
a
point
about
because
they
failed
to
show
that
the
land
never
obliterated.
this
is
why
we
were
prepared
and,
fact
is,
we
put
in
some
evidence
on
the
issue
of
avulsion
but
it
was
manifest
when
our
witnesses
could
only
say
they
would
prefer
to
have
the
laws
of
accretions
to
the
state
of
iowa
or
that
they
said
this
is
educated
guesses,
well,
i'm
not
going
to
take
any--
have
to
do
any
work
on
it
than
that.
we
just
went
on
right
down
the
line
and
say
“yes,
we've
proved
that
land
was
never
washed
away.”
mr.
william
h.
veeder
assume
they
had
said
that?
mr.
william
h.
veeder
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
assuming
after
that--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
well,
i
think
we
would
win
because
we've
been
in
our
prima
facie
case
and
they
had
overcome
it.
they
ha--
we
put
in
the
case
that
the
land
was
being
situated
where
they
were.
we
put
in
the
evidence
that--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
but,
your
honor,
you
see--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
we
do
because
they
had--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
they
had
the
burden
of
proving--
your
honor,
they
couldn't
win
on
the
strength
of
their
case
for
one
very
simple
reason.
they
had
no
patents,
remember
this.
they'll
tell
you
differently,
but
they
didn't.
we
checked
it
out
thoroughly.
they
had
no
strength
to
their
claims.
we
were
in
possession,
remember
that,
and
we
were
pleading
ownership--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
indeed,
we
were,
your
honor.
we
were
careful
about
that.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
william
h.
veeder
what?
yes,
the
law
is
very
clear
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
and--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
what
i
was
saying
in
this
is
that
we
were
plaintiffs
in
possession
claiming
title,
predicated
upon
a
treaty,
and
we
made
our
prima
facie
case
and
the
only
way
they
could
win
is
if
they
had
the
affirmative
to
prove
that
that
land
was
washed
away
and
replaced
by
accretions.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
wholly
independent
of
194.
i
used
194
and
relied
upon
it.
there's
no
question
about
it,
but
i
do
say
that
you
cannot
extract
1--
25
usc
194
from
this
lawsuit.
you
can't
take
it
out
of
the
context
of
what
we
referred
in
the
history
of
it
and
i
don't
think
we
should
do
that.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
if
we're
in
possession,
yes.
i
think
so.
we
should--
we
were
in
possession
under
claimant
title
there.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
well,
we've--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
well,
your
honor,
under
this
circumstance,
and
we
have
to
look
at
the
circumstance,
we
were
there
claiming
under
a
treaty.
they
had
no
patent.
they
had
nothing.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
you

to
remedy
the
stre--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
you
have
to
remedy
the
strength
of
your
title.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
i
would
assume
that
if
they
were
in
possession
that
might
be
the
situation,
but
they
wouldn't
here,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
veeder
may
i
hear
that
again,
justice?
mr.
william
h.
veeder
well,
your
honor,
the--
my
argument
is
very
explicit
on
that
point.
it's
that
i
don't
believe
that
this
case
should
go
off
strictly
on
an
interpretation
in
25
usc
194.
i
think
it
has
to
go
on
to
both
our
elements
of
the
pleadings
that
were
presented
here
and
the
fact
that
we
went
ahead
and
proved
that
we
were
in
possession,
that
we
proved
that
there
were
no
accretions,
and
that
the
title
would
reside
with
us
under
the
circumstances.
we
did
rely
upon
the
primacy
of
federal
law.
we
did
rely
upon
25
usc
194,
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
these
petitioners
assume
the
burden
of
proof
placed
upon
them
under
25
usc
194
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
“you
failed
because
your
testimony
was
conjectural
on--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
i
do
care
very
much,
your
honor.
as
a
lawyer
representing
indian
people,
i
think
i
believe
in
the
primacy
of
federal
law
and
i
think
25
usc
194
is
extremely
important,
but
i'm
also--
is
my
time
up
i
have--
mr.
william
h.
veeder
thank
you.
