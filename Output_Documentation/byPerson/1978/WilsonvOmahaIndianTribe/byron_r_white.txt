what
if
in
an
earlier
century
than
that,
iowa
and
nebraska
had
become
involved
in
a
dispute
as
to
their
boundary?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
same
area
and
they
sued
each
other
in
this
court,
and
the
question
was--
it
got
down
to
whether
there
was
accretion
or
avulsion?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
now--
and
that--
so,
that--
but
that's
irrelevant
in
this
case
because,
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
events
that
changed
the
river
took
place
at
a
time
when
federal
law
would've
controlled
if
there
hadn't
been
a
dispute
between
iowa--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
it's
really
no
different
than
if
the
same
property
had
simply
been
public
lands,
not
an
indian
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
un--
the
mere
ownership
of
riparian
land
by
the
united
states
doesn't
mean
that
the
law
of
avulsion
or
accretion
should
be
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
section
of
the
river,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
it
should
be
decided
just
as
though
this
weren't
an
interstate
river
at
all,
if
it
were
just
a
river
inside
some
state.
the
riparian
ownership
of
land
by
the
united
states
wouldn't
mean
federal
law
would
control.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mrs.
beale,
what
about
the
admission
in--
at
page
75
of
the
appendix
which,
i
gather,
is
the
answer
of
the
respondents,
admit
that
the
lands
described
in
paragraph
2
of
plaintiff's
complaint
were,
in
1867,
a
part
of
the
omaha
indian
reservation,
to
which,
united
states
held
title
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
the
omaha
tribe
of
indians.
is
that
enough
to
trigger
the
presumption?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
enough
to
trigger
the
presumption
i
think--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
question
would
be
different
if
the
reservation
was
a
newly
created
reservation
and
was
covered
land
that
was--
to
which
the
tribe
never
had--
justice
byron
r.
white
aboriginal
title?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
agree--
would
you
agree
the
other
way
too,
that
the
two
cases
should
be
decided
the
same
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
suppose
there's
a
navigable
river
inside
a
state,
it's
not
a
boundary
river,
and
there's
an
indian
reservation
on
one
side
of
the
stream
and
just
west
of
it
is
a
federal
military
installation
and
then
there's
a
national
forest
on
the
same
side
of
the
stream,
all
in
a
row.
and
then,
there
are
a
series
of
changes
in
the
river
and
there's
private
ownership
on
the
other
side,
not
in
the--
and
there's
a--
and
the
river
changes
like
it
did
here.
you
say
federal
law
applies
in
each
of
those
cases
as
to
whether
there's
avulsion
or
accretion?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
really
suggest
that
that's
consistent
with
corvallis,
can
you?
