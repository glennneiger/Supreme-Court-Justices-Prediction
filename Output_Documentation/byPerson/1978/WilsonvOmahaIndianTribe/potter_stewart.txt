justice
potter
stewart
mr.
smith,
i
was
a
little
confused
by
the
--
just
the
nexus
of
what
you're
telling
us
now
about
the
factual
situation
by
the
state
of
iowa
petitioner's
reply
brief
filed
here
on
march
17.
on
page
14,
it
says
under
the
conclusion
“within
the
living
memory,
the
land
in
issue
has
always
been
on
the
west
bank
of
the
missouri
river
--
justice
potter
stewart
within
the
state
of
iowa.”
justice
potter
stewart
shouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
helpful
drawing
in
these
papers?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that's
where
--
there
are
several
drawings
in
representation.
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
white
--
i
see
it.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
justice
potter
stewart
filed
here
july
28.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
most
helpful
drawing.
justice
potter
stewart
applying
what
law?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
which
was
somewhat
more
favorable
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
law
of
nebraska
was
somewhat
more
favorable
to
the
tribe
than
would've
been
the
law
of
iowa,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
its
presumption
of
avulsion.
justice
potter
stewart
each
individual
indian
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
his
own
property
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
different
case
away,
but
i
just
wonder
if
the
singular
is
significant
rather
than
the
fact
it
refers
to
“indians”
rather
than
“indian
tribes.”
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you're
cor--
if
it
was
accreted
land,
then
the
land
didn't
exist
until
the
accretion.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
going
to
make
a
constitutional
argument
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
your
brief
on
the
merits,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
construction
of
the
statute,
as
well
as
the
appellee
--
justice
potter
stewart
belongs
to
what?
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
really
have
it.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
present
case,
diversity
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
the
united
states
is
the
plaintiff.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
veeder.
justice
potter
stewart
the--
this
litigation
began,
as
i
understand
it,
by
a
bill
to
quiet
title--
justice
potter
stewart
filed
by
the
tribe
and
by
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
but
that's
just--
if
you
just
please
listen
to
my
question--
justice
potter
stewart
and
answer
it,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
it
began
by
a
bill
to
fi--
to
quiet
title
filed
by
your
client
and
the
united
states
as
plaintiffs--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
the--
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
in
order
to--
i
suppose
the
allegations
in
that
complaint
were
that,
or
at
least
depended
upon,
the
proposition
that
this
was
an
avulsive
change,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
as
some
sort
of
a
statutory
or
other
presumptions
or
inferences
that
would
change
the
general
rules,
the
general
rule
would
be
that
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proof,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
at--
the
so-called
“under
the
sky
meets
and
bounds”?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
the
“meets
and
bounds”?
justice
potter
stewart
“under
the
sky”?
justice
potter
stewart
because,
under
the
ordinary
rules
of
this,
this
land
would've
had
to
shift
it
to
the
east
bank
of
the
river
by
reason
of
avulsion
for
it
to
be
the
same
land
in
the
iowa
property
law,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
actual
loss
of
the
land
on
the
west
bank
and
a
gradual
accretion
on
the
east
bank
and
a
gradual
erosion
on
the
west
bank
than
under
ordinary
property
laws,
it
wouldn't--
it
would've
belonged
to
the
owners
on
the
east
bank,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
owners
on
the
east,
isn't
that
generally
proper--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
please
do.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
directly
in
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
a
presumption.
i'm
talking
about
what
historically
happened.
and,
if
what
historically
happened
was
the
gradual
erosion
of
the
west
bank
and
the
gradual
accretion
of
land
on
the
east
bank,
then
the
original
west
bank
owners
no
longer
own
the
land.
now,
you
say
that's
over
simplistic.
do
you
mean
to
say
that's
in--
that's
long
been
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
by
saying
over
simplistic,
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
it's
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
and
don't
hesitate
if
that's
what
you
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
normally,
when
one
files
a
complaint
in
a
civil
case,
the
general
rule
is
that
it's
his
burden
to
prove
his
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
by
prescriptive
writings?
justice
potter
stewart
well--
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
that
in
the--
where
is
that
in
their
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
this
blue
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
question
was--
you
said
that
they
answered
“yes,
we
admit
that
the
tribe
once
occupied
this
land.”
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
was
just
wondering
where
that
was
in
the
briefs.
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
don't
really
say
“yes,
we
admit
the
lands
in
controversy
were
once
occupied
by
the
tribe.”
justice
potter
stewart
they
said
those
lands
are
gone,
eroded
away.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
where?
where
did
they
say
the
lands
in
question
were
once
occupied
by
the
indians?
you
said
they
admitted
it
in
their
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
of
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
that's
a
little
different
from
saying
that
the
lands
in
controversy
were
once
occupied
and
they
say
that
they--
the
lands
once--
that
the
lands--
that
the
indians
once
occupied
no
longer
exists.
that's
what
they
say.
it
eroded
away.
