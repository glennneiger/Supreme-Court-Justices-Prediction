justice
william
h.
rehnquist
actually,
in
the
1822
enactment
in
section
4,
when
you
go
back
in
statutes
at
large,
it's
used
in
the
plural
in
the
first
sentence
in
the
first
clause
and
the
singular
in
the
second
clause,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
they
did
that
as
a
matter
of
the
federal
boundary
law
of
accretion
and
avulsion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
had
always
read
nebraska
against
iowa,
the
143
us
case,
to
stand
for
the
proposition
that
there's
a
presumption
that
it--
the
change
occurred
by
accretion
rather
than
avulsion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
many
texts
had
read
it
the
same
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
court
declined
to
credit
your
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals'
treatment
of
that
issue
is
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
nebraska
against
iowa?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
143,
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
it
would
make
no
difference
in
this
case
whether
federal
law
or
state
law
applies?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
should
we
do
though
if--
what
should
we
do
if
we
decide
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
the
applicable
law
and
that
the
law
was
state
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know,
but
what
if
we
deci--
what
if
we
disagree
with
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
you
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
“we're
now
reviewing
our--
we're
now
exercising
our
reviewing
function
and
we
find
this
evidence,
as
to
whether
there
was
accretion
or
avulsion,
to
be
evenly
balanced”?
let's
just
assume
that's
what--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
didn't--
isn't
that
what
they
said?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
assume
they
had.
who--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
loses
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know.
maybe
you
put
in
a
prima
facie
case
but
when
the
defendants
get
through
with
their
case
a
court
says
“the
evidence
is
now
evenly
balanced.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
wins
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
100
years
ago.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
were
in
possession
when
you
started
the
lawsuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
had
the
fires
burning.[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
wholly
independent
of
194.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
is.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
beale,
are
you--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
beale,
are
you
addressing
yourself
now
both
to
the
meaning
of
the
words
“an
indian”
and
a
“white
person,”
or
just
“an
indian”?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
beale,
following
up
on
justice
stevens'
question,
is
there
any
precise
date
that
can
be
assigned
to
the
time
when
the
united
states
began
to
sue
on
behalf
of
indian
awards
for
title
to
land?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
an
indian.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
this
was
the
state
of
oklahoma
where
one
might
quite
reasonably
make
an
argument
that
oklahoma
is
not
a
non-indian
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
state
could
prove
by
some
sort
of
census
figures
and
bloodline
figures
that
the
majority
of
its
citizens
were
indians,
then
it
would
not
be
the
subject
of
the
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
one
question,
mrs.
beale,
if
i
might.
there's
this
sentence
on
pa--
the
last
sentence
of
pate
71
of
the
government's
brief.
it
says,
accordingly,
the
question
whether
indian
title
to
a
portion
of
a
reservation
has
been
lost
must
be
determined
by
the
application
of
federal
common
law
which
embodies
the
sum
of
federal
law
making
on
the
issues
and
interests
involved.
am
i
to
understand
from
that
that,
entirely
apart
from
the
non-intercourse
act,
that
it
may
be
a
“heads
i
win,
tails
you
lose
situation”
when
indians
are
involved
that
is
the--
precisely
the
same
historical
facts
may
take
place
but
j--
by
reason
of
“federal
common
law,”
the
indians
would
win
in
each
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
