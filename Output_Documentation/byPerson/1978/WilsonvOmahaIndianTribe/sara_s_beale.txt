ms.
sara
s.
beale
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
cover
both
the
statutory
question
and
the
choice
of
law
question
during
the
course
of
my
argument,
and
i
would
propose
to
turn
first
to
the
statutory
questions
since
they
do
provide
a
backdrop
for
the
consideration
of
the
choice
of
law
question.
this
morning's
questions
raise
one
point
that
i'd
like
to
clear
up
immediately
in
the
terms
of
the
application
of
section
194
to
this
case.
that
was
a
threshold
question
of
is
this
the
kind
of
case
where
the
united
states
and
the
tribe
could
have
shown
previous
possession
or
ownership
in
order
to
invoke
the
presumption
of
section
194,
and
a
suggestion
was
made
or
the
question
was
raised
if
it's
the
kind
of
case
where
the
allegations
are
that
the
land
that
the
united
states
and
the
tribe
were
seeking
was
destroyed,
does
that
mean
that
the
showing
initially
made
to--
or
required
to
invoke
the
presumption
is
the
same
showing
that's
required
to
prevail
in
the
case
as
a
whole
and
that
it's
circular,
in
that,
we've
not
made
out
our
initial
burden
of
claiming
the
applicability
of
the
statute?
we
think
not.
we
think
that
when
the
tribe
and
the
united
states
showed
that
the
land
at
these
“meets
and
bounds,”
“under
the
sky,”
however
one
would
want
to
describe
it,
the
property
at
that
location
was
part
of
the
reservation
where
title--
legal
title
was
held
by
the
united
states
and
the
beneficial
ownership
was
in
the
omaha
indian
tribe
that
we've
shown
previous
possession
or
ownership
as
of
1867.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
think
even
if
they
had
not
admitted
that
much--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
i
think
it
is,
surely.
i
think
it
is
and,
therefore,
we
think
that
the
question
here
is
“did
some
events
occur
after
the
time
of
our
pre--
possession
and
ownership,
which
we
have
shown?”
that
would
be
given
legal
effect
to
cut
off
the
ownership
of
the
tribe
and
of
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
the
tribe,
just
as
if
we
have
shown
that
we
had
previous
possession
and
ownership
in
1867
and
there
was
a
conveyance
whose
validity
was
disputed.
the
question
would
be,
because
of
those
events,
did
we
or
did
we
not
lose
title?
by
the
same
token,
we
think
we've
shown
that
this
property
was
held
by
the
united
states
for
the
tribe
in
1867
and
then
the
question
is,
given
the
presumption
that
their
ownership
continued,
were
there
events
that
occurred
which
had
the
legal
effect
of
cutting
off
that
title?
as
the
court
knows
from
some
of
its
previous
cases,
congress
passed
a
series
of
statutes
to
regulate
trade
and
interaction
between
indian
tribes
and
non-indians
and
to
protect
the
peaceful
possession
of
indian
lands
in
the
1790s
and
in
the
early
1800s.
section
194
was
added
as
an
amendment
in
1822
to
the
current
version
of
the
non-intercourse
act,
and
we
think
its
clear
policy
and
intent
was
to
play
a
role
in
protecting
the
possession
and
the
ownership
of
these
indian
lands
against
dubious
or
questionable
claims
by
non-indians.
and,
we
think
that
overall
intent
and
purpose,
that
protective
purpose,
has
to
be
kept
in
mind
in
construing
the
particular
questions
that
the
petitioners
have
raised.
the
first
set
of
questions
that
they
have
raised
is,
who
may
invoke
the
protection
of
section
194?
the
statute
itself
says
when
an
indian
is
a
party,
“when
an
indian,”
and
he
makes
out
a
presumption
of
title
in
himself.
now,
we
don't
think
that,
by
using
the
singular
term
“an
indian,”
congress
meant
to
preclude
either
one,
two,
or
three
indians,
the--
a
tribe
which
is
a
group
of
indians,
or
the
united
states
as
trustee
for
either
an
individual
indian
or
for
the
tribe
to
prevent
that
those--
any
of
those
claimants
from
invoking
the
protection
of
194
when
a
non-indian
claimant
makes
a
challenge
to
lands
that
were
originally
owned
by
the
indians.
we
think
that,
consistent
with
the
clear
policy,
one
would
give
that
singular
word
“an
indian”
the
meaning
that
would
include
the
united
states
and
the
tribe.
and,
we
think
that
is
consistent
with
the
normal
rule
of
construction
in
1
usc
1
which
says,
as
a
general
matter,
singular
words
ha--
mean
the
same
as
plural
words.
they
are
used
interchangeably.
now,
the
question
is
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
remainder
of
the
text
of
the
1832--
1834
or
1822
versions
of
the
non-intercourse
act
that
shows
some
narrower
intent
by
congress.
is
there
anything
specific
that
would
show
that
they--
instead
of
meaning
it--
that
the
act
should
have
this
broader
application
but
that,
instead,
it
should
only
mean
“an
indian”?
ms.
sara
s.
beale
actually,
i'm
not
certain
that--
of
that
question.
i
couldn't
give
you
an
exact--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
i'm
really
not
certain
if
there
is
another
contemporary
statute
that
has
been
construed
that
way.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
that's
right,
and
i'm
just
not
certain
if
there
was
another
contemporary
act
that
had
that
meaning.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
was
starting
with
“an
indian,”
but
i
also
do
want
to
get
to
“a
white
person.”
and,
my
point
was
merely
that,
as
a
general
rule,
one--
in
looking
at
a
statute
such
as
this,
not
only
from
the
policy
point
of
view
but
from
the
rule
of
general
construction,
one
would
assume
that
the
word
would
be
broad
enough
to
include
the
tribes
and
the
united
states
when
it's
representing
interests
of
a
single
indian
or
a
tribe.
and,
we
have
dealt
with
in
our
brief
the
question
of
comparing
this
section
to
other
portions
of
the
1834
act
in
which
it
was
included.
there's
a
suggestion
that,
by
comparing
this
particular
provision
to
either
section
12
or
to
other
provisions,
one
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
definite
intent
to
narrow
the
meaning
of
section
194.
that
it
was
narrowed
from
the
terms
that
were
used
in
the
1822
act.
as
discussed
this
morning,
the
1822
act
used
not
only
the
term
“an
indian,”
but
also
a
plural
term
“indians.”
why
did
congress
change
it
in
1834?
we
think
that
the
only
reason
they
changed
it
was
to
make
the
language
of
the
section
consistent
throughout.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
any
other
intent
and
we
don't
find
any
of
the
guess
work
very
persuasive
to
really
suggest
that
there
was
some
other
intent.
we
have
found
one
report
from
that
period
which
was
designed
as
a
model
of
the
amendment
of
all
the
indian
statutes
and
it
shows
the
precise
change
that
congress
made
here
between
1822
and
1834,
and
it
indicates
that
no
intent
wa--
that
there
was
no
intent
to
change
the
meaning
of
that
section.
we
think
it
was
just
to
clean
up
the
syntax.
and,
we
would
question
the
court
against
holding
section194
up
against
the
other
provisions
of
the
1834
act
and
finding
that
because
the
term
“indian
tribe”
is
used
in
some
of
those
other
provisions
that
that
would
show
an
intent
not
to
include
“indian
tribe”
here.
we
think
it's
pretty
clear
from
looking
at
that
1822
language
that
congress
was
not
very
careful
and
precise.
in
the
same
statute
it
said
“an
indian,”
“indians,”
“white
persons,”
“a
white
person,”
“himself.”
it's
not
a
carefully
drafted
provision
and,
if
one
looks
at
the
1832
act--
the
1834
act,
again,
the
terminology
varies
very
greatly
from
section
to
section.
these
sections
were
pulled
from
different
enactments,
some
in
1796,
some
in
1822,
and
they
didn't
make
the
language
consistent
throughout.
so,
we
would
say,
looking
at
this
provision
in
1822,
giving
effect
to
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
general
rule
of
construction,
that
it
should
be
applied
to
a
group
of
indians,
a
single
indian,
and
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
the
tribe.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
absolutely.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
think
it
was
not
only
that
there
might
be
a
disadvantage
but
that
there
was
a
very
important
press
to
protecting
the
tribal
land
so
that
they
wouldn't
be
lost
in
a
questionable
case.
now,
granted
the
united
states
as
a
representative
of
the
tribe
would
be
more
familiar
with
court
rules
and
court
procedures
and
would
have
more
resources,
but
i
don't
think
that
there
should
be
a
rule
that
would
cut
against
or
discourage
the
united
states
from
helping
out
an
indian
tribe
or
a
single
indian
from
enforcing
his
rights,
and
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
protecting
indian
lands
is
the
same.
so
that,
the
fact
that
the
united
states
comes
in
and
if
the
real
party
in
interest
is
someone
entitled
to
invoke
section
194
to
protect
those
indian
interests
that
it
should
not
make
a
difference
that
the
government
has
more
resources
or
is
more
familiar
with
courtroom
procedures.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
that's
a
new
suggested
question.
there
are
some
very
early
cases.
heckman
would
be
an
early
one,
but
i
think
there
are
even
some
earlier
than
that.
i
can't--
i
guess
i
cannot
put
a
precise
date
on
that.
one
thing
i
would
mention
in
that
connection
though
is
that
there's
been
a
suggestion
that
the
tribes
could
not
be
litigating
in
1834
and
that
congress
was
thinking
about
who
could
be
coming
into
court
in
1834
and
thinking
that
individual
indians
could
and
that
tribes
couldn't.
we
haven't
found
anything
that
would
back
up
that
suggestion
and,
indeed,
the
citation
to
the
cohen
article--
the
cohen
handbook
suggest
to
the
contrary
that,
although
indian
tribes
were
not
considered
to
be
a
foreign
nation
in
that
sense
for
jurisdictional
purposes,
that
they
were
coming
into
court.
and,
i
think
even--
i
can't
tell
you
as
a
certainty
that
in
1834
there
was
a
case
where
the
united
states
came
in
but
there
are
some
very
earlier
ones
in
the
1800s
and
i
don't
know
of
any
suggestion
that
they
couldn't
have
come
in
that
early.
i
would
like
to
turn
on,
unless
there
are
any
more
questions
about
the
“an
indian”
part
of
the
statute,
to
the
“white
person”
part
of
the
statute.
and,
again,
we
would
start
from
the
presumption
or
from
the
beginning
point
that
congress
had
again
a
broad
protective
purpose
and
we
think
when
it
used
the
term
“white
person”
it
was
not
thinking
solely
of
individual
caucasians.
and,
we
think
that
in
order
to
give
the
protective
purposes
of
the
statute
their
full
effect
that
we
should
assume
that
what
congress
meant
was
“non-indian
claimant
to
the
land,”
and
the
constitutional
difficulties
that
were
referred
to
this
morning
are
a
good
reason
for
choosing
what
we
believe
to
be
a
construction
that
is,
one,
was
intended
by
congress
and,
two,
gives
effect
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
we
can't--
we
do
not
think
that
the
statute
could
be
upheld
if
it
distinguished
between
caucasian
claimants,
on
the
one
hand,
she
would
be
disadvantaged,
black
claimants,
chinese
claimants,
asian-american
claimants,
on
the
other
hand.
we
think
that
there--
that
they
could
not
be
upheld
on
that
basis
and,
so,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
give
the
statute
a
construction
which
not
only
fulfills
congress'
purposes
and
is
consistent--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
i
think
the
state
of
iowa
says
that
it
is
not
a
“white
person”
and
it
says,
number
one,
that
it's
not
a
person
at
all
and,
number
two,
if
it
is
a
person,
it's
not
white.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
no,
and
we--
the
reason
being,
we
think
if
white--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
absolutely.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
absolutely,
but
we
would
say
that--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
yes,
that's
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
had
some
of
the
omaha
indians,
if
we
prevail
here,
but
the--[laughter]
what
we
think
was
intended
here,
if
we're
correct
in
saying
that
“white”
means
non-indian
here,
the
new
think
that
the
only
question
really
is,
is
the
state
of
iowa
a
person?
we
do
not
think
that
they
prete--
that
they
would
ever
claim
to
be
an
indian
person.
we
think
that
they
would
agree
that
they
aren't
predominantly
non-indian
in
that
sense,
and
the
court
has
previously
ruled
in
a
number
of
context
that
where
it
promotes
congress'
intent
and
where
it
is
the
intent
of
congress,
the
word
“person”
is
broad
enough
to
include
a
state.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
it
would
be
my
understanding
that
it's
not,
although
it
has
a
sizable
number
of
indian
citizens,
that
it's
by
no
means
predominantly
or
the
majority
of
the
citizens
are
non-indians.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
can't
give
a
definite
answer
to
it.
i
would
say
that
the
same
problem
could
arise
if
the
majority
ownership
of
a
corporation,
and
we
contend
a
corporation
as
well
as
an
individual--
a
flesh
and
blood
individual
could
also
be
a
non-indian
person.
and,
if
we're
correct
in
saying
that
person
has
this
broader
meaning
beyond
individuals,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
would
have
to
decide,
is
it
a
question
of
the
predominant
the
majority
ownership,
the
majority
membership?
and,
i
think
that
would
be
one
very
reasonable
way
to
draw
the
line.
that
so
long
as
this
litigating
party,
this
juristic
person,
is
now
predominantly
indian,
that
it
could
be
properly
denominated
a
non-indian
claimant
for
that
purpose.
there
may
be
other
ways
that
you
could
draw
that
line,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
might
be
a
reasonable
way
to
draw
them,
and
i
do
not
understand
here
that
the
state
of
iowa
claims
to
be
a
predominantly
indian
person
in
that
sense.
i
don't
think
that
question
is
really
before
us.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
i
would
have
serious
doubts
about
that,
and
i
also
think
that
in--
as
our
brief
stated,
in
retrospect,
we
think
the
historical
analysis
which
we
promoted
at
the
time
is
incorrect
and
we
would
think
if
the
statute
came
before
the
court
again
that
we
would
urge
that
that
was
not
what
congress
intended
in
that
section.
but,
if
that
was
what
congress
intended
then
i
think
that
there
would
be
serious
constitutional
difficulties
there.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
it's
certainly
a
precedent
for
this
court
and,
i
guess,
the
position
that
we
took
in
the
brief
is
the
same
one
that
i
would
urge
here.
we
pointed
out
that
we
think
that
that
decision
may
be
wrong,
but
we
also
pointed
out
that,
even
in
terms
of
construing
that
section
congress
looked--
or
this
court
looked
very
much
to
the
peculiar
legislative
history
of
that
provision
and
said,
because
congress
was
attempting
to
distinguish
here
between
fugitive
slaves
and
white
persons,
when
it
said
“white
person,”
it
meant
caucasian
person
and
that
is
certainly
some
type
of
legislative
history
that
we
do
not
have
here,
so
that
the
perryman
decision
can
be
distinguished.
now,
as
a
matter
of
our
view,
we
think
that
it,
number
one,
may
be
wrong
and,
number
two--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
that
must--
i
think
that--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
i
went
back
and
looked
at
our
briefs
to
see
what
he
had
done,
and
we
had
urged
that
this
is--
that
the
history
here
showed
very
clearly
that
the
problem
with
the
interracial
wars,
and
so
forth,
between
the
tribes
and
the
citi--
local
citizens
in
georgia
were
so
serious
that
congress
reacted
to
that
in
drawing
section
16
and
in
changing
the
language
of
section
16
from
a
broader
term
which
didn't
use
the
word
“white.”
i
think
it
was
“any
citizen”
or
“other
person.”
when
they
put
in
“white
person,”
we
argued
to
the
court,
and
this
court
agreed,
they
must
have
meant
white
person.
they
must
have
been
thinking
about
this
problem
in
georgia.
now,
what
we
didn't
do
was
to
connect
up
that
history,
which
i
assume
we
were
correct
about,
the--
that
there
were
problems
in
georgia
at
that
time
with
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
in
enacting
that
particular
statute.
we
didn't
show
anyone
refer
to
it
in
the
debates
or
that
it
was
mentioned
in
the
committee
reports,
anything
of
that
nature,
and
that's
why
i'm
suggesting
that
perhaps
the
line
wasn't
as
clear
as
the
court
thought
and
as
we
argued
at
the
time.
but,
the
basis
of
that
decision,
whether
we
find
it
persuasive
or
not,
and
i
would
agree
with
you
that
it's
not
compelling,
is
that
particular
legislative
history.
so,
we
would
think
that
it
can
clearly
be
distinguished
on
that
basis.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
i
would
certainly
like
to
do
that
right
now.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
we
believe
that
the
united
decision
is
the
most
recent
expression
by
this
court
of
what
we
think
is
the
dispositive
principle
here,
and
that
is
that
indian
title
is
a
right
not
only
conferred
exclusively
by
a
federal
law,
but
continuously
protected
and
controlled
by
federal
law
and,
this
is
very
important,
subject
only
to
termination
in
accordance
with
and
by
means
of
federal
law.
and,
for
that
reason,
the
court
in
oneida
held
that
a
federal
cause
of
action
was
presented
when
the
tribe
contended
that
land
that--
100
years
ago
had
been
their
lands
and
was
now
settled
by
many
other
people
when
they
brought
a
possessory
action
for
that
land
and,
here
also,
we
think
when
the
omaha
indian
tribe
and
the
united
states
as
trustee
comes
in
and
says
the
indian
title
to
this
land
has
never
been
terminated.
and,
the
question
is
has
indian
title
been
terminated
or
not,
that
federal
law
must
apply,
and
the
history
of
the
non-intercourse
act,
and
the
reason
that
i
wanted
to
discuss
section
194
first,
shows
very
clearly
the
congressional--
and
its
overwriting
federal
and
congressional
interest
in
the
protection
of
indian
lands
and
the
means
by
which
indian
title
can
be
terminated.
there--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
aboriginal
title?
ms.
sara
s.
beale
i
don't
think
it
would
be,
but
if
the
court
thought
that--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
i
would
think
that
they
should
be
but
we
have
both
points
here.
not
only
do
we
have
a
reservation
established
by
federal
law,
but
this
was
the
aboriginal
home
of
the
omaha
indian,
so
that,
to
the
extent
that
that's
a
necessary
ingredient,
we
clearly
have
that
ingredient
here.
and,
we
don't
find
any
inconsistency
between
the
decision
in
oneida
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
decision
in
corvallis
which
petitioners
rely
upon
on
the
other
hand.
corvallis
says
only,
as
we
read
it,
that
when
there
is
no
federal
interest
requiring
the
displacement
of
state
law,
local
property
law
controls
the
ownership
and
the
incidence
of
ownership
of
land
along
a
waterway,
a
stream,
a
river,
and
what
we
are
saying
and
what
oneida
holds
is
that
there
is
a
continuing
federal
interest
requiring
the
displacement
of
state
law
when
it
is
a
question
of
indian
reservation
title,
aboriginal
title
perhaps
also,
as
well
as
federally
conferred
and
protected
rights
to
indian
possession.
and,
additionally,
i
think
we
would
point
to
the
portion
of
the
corvallis
decision
which
notes
that
when
the
question
is
not
what
happens
after
a
federal
patent
has
issued
but
has
title
gone
from
the
federal
government
to
a
patentee
or,
in
this
case,
to
other
kinds
of
claimants,
that
question,
whether
federal
ownership
has
passed,
is
always
one
of
federal
law.
wilcox
v.
jackson,
very
early
cases,
established
the
proposition
that
when
a
question
is
a
termination
or
not
a
federal
interest,
the
passing
of
title
from
the
federal
government
that,
again,
federal
law
always
governs
that
question.
so,
we
find
ourselves
very
comfortable
in
the
corvallis
for
that
reason.
it's
wholly
consistent
with
the
special
rule
for
indian
title
and
the
special
rule
for
considering
whether
federal
title
has
been
terminated
or
has
passed.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
yes,
we
do
and
we
think
that
the
federal
law
applies
in
the
case
of
the--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
indian
reservation
for--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
would
say
two
things.
i
think,
in
its
citation
of
wilcox
v.
jackson,
corvallis
does
suggest
that
the
question
of
whether
federal
title
has
been
lost
is
always
the
question
of
federal
law
but
even
if
we're
not
right
on
that,
even
if
merely
the
federal
ownership
of
public
domain
lands
is
not
enough.
i
think
oneida
clearly
establishes
that
there's
an
additional
peg
to
our
argument
when
we're
speaking
of
federally
protected
indian
lands
where
congress
has
specifically
moved
to
oust
the
states
of
jurisdiction
in
has
specifically
claimed
for
itself
the
question
of
when
federal--
when
and
how
indian
rights
may
be
terminated.
so,
we
think
that
tha--
that
it's
an
easy--
the
easiest
case
for
us
is
the
indian
reservation.
now,
we
would
read
wilcox
v.
jackson
and
corvallis
is
saying,
at
least
when
there's
federal
ownership,
the
question
whether
our
title
is
lost
at
least
would
also
be
federal
law.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
think
i'll
t--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
no.
if
i
understand
you,
you're
saying
that
does
federal--
do
we
chose
federal
law
or
make
federal
law
in
such
a
way
that
indian
always
win--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
if
federal
law
applies
and,
in
our
contention,
that
would
be
no,
that
indians
can
lose
as
well
as
win
under
federal
law
but
that
it's
important
to
be
applying
federal
law
not
only
because
congress
has
manifested
this
intent
and
so
forth,
but
in
order
that
if
under
federal
law,
the
indians
would
win
as
they
do
here.
and,
the
reservation
purposes
could
be
continued,
that
the
indians
have
the
benefit
of
that
rule
but
they
don't
always
win.
we
don't
think
that
you
jimmy
federal
law
to
make
the
indians
win
in
each
case.
