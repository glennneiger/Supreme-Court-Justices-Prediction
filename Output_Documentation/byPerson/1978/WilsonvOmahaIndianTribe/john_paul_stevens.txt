justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
mean
avulsion
of
federal
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
then,
if
it
were
decided
that
assuming
that
federal
law
applies,
we
don't
have
an
issue
here
as
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
directly
viewed
the
federal
law
of
avulsion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay,
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
is
it
your
view
that
if,
say,
a
husband
and
wife
who
were
joint
tenants
of
a
property
were
indian
would
not
have
the
benefit
of
the
statute
if
they
both
brought
suit
on
the
cases
without
being
entitled
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
don't
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
there
are
three?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
do
we
distinguish
between
singular
and
plural
then?
it's
not
too
many,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
either
you
con
--
once
you
concede
that,
you're
conceding
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
a
different
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
i
think
you
really
are
abandoning
the
point
that
the
singular
is
of
any
significance.
you're
saying
there's
a
difference
between
the
word
“indians”
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
shouldn't
we
read
this
at
least
as
covering
plural
indians
and
not
place
so
much
emphasis
on
the
“an
indian”?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
instead
of
the
tribe
suing
one
tribe--
tribal
member,
it
sued
on
behalf
of
the
class
of
indians
who
belonged
to
the
tribe?
how
would
you
handle
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
that
a
fundamental
reason
why
the
statutory
presumption
is
inapplicable
to
this
case,
even
if
it
otherwise
would
be?
because,
in
order
to
invoke
it,
one--
the
indian
or
indians
must
show
against
a
“white
person”
previous
possession
or
ownership,
and
doesn't
that
assume
the
answer
to
the
issue
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
correct,
regardless
of
your
argument,
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
presumption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
he
shows
previous
possession
or
ownership
then,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
change
must
have
been
an
avuslive
change
and
the
indians
win
regardless
of
any
presumption.
isn't
that
correct,
under
the
law
of
nebraska
or
of
iowa
or
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
this
federal
law
in
any
event.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
that
turn
on
whether
one
takes
this
“under
the
sky”
approach
to
the
land
or
decide
first
whether
there's
accretion
and
an
avulsion?
if
you
talk
about
“under
the
sky”
or
meets
in
bounds
by
latitude
and
longitude--
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
think
a
prima
facie
case
of
that,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
measure
the
latitude
and
longitude
“under
the
sky”
or
however
you
phrase
it
here,
they
did
demonstrate
everyone's
satisfaction
that
this
area
was,
at
one
time,
within
the
reservation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
isn't
that
an
issue
you
have
to
decide
in
reading
the
statute?
does
it
mean
presumption
of
title
to
the
area
under
the
sky
or
do
you
mean
to
resolve
the
accretion-avulsion
dispute
first?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
say
anything.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
word
“land”
appear
in
section
22?
i
don't
find
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
is
conceded
by
everybody
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
particular
area
on
the
surface
of
the
earth,
at
one
time,
did
belong
to
the
indi.
justice
john
paul
stevens
depending
on
how
one
construes
the
word
“property”
within
the
meaning
of
section
22.
that's
just
--
that's
the
issue
one
must
decide,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
under
your
construction
of
the
statute--
presumption
of
the
statute,
its
constitutionality
would
be
very
dubious,
wouldn't
it?
because
it
would
be
discriminating--
we've
held
that
discrimination
favoring
indians
at
the
expense
of
non-indians
does
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
at
least,
context
but
favoring--
justice
john
paul
stevens
disfavoring
white
people
at
the
expense
of
everybody
else,
negros
and
everybody
else,
would
raise
serious
constitutional
questions
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
a
discrimination
--
a
differentiation
between
indians
and
non-indians
would
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
say--
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
white
person
doesn't
mean
“non-indian”
and,
hence,
it
means
what
it
says,
“white
person.”
and,
that
would
invoke
serious
constitutional
doubts
if
that's
correct,
wouldn't
it?
because
that
means
that
you're
discriminating
against
white
persons
in
favor
of
not
only
indians
but
colored
people,
yellow
people,
brown
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
solicitor
general.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
more
it
felt
its
discrimination
differentiation
to
the
benefit
of
indians
between
indians
and
non-indians
does
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause,
at
least
in
a
certain
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
our
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
is.
the
court
held
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
employment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
favoring
indians
against
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
even
worse
if
there
were
discrimination
against
people
who
were
white
in
favor
of
everybody
else,
wouldn't
it,
indians,
black
people,
brown
people,
yellow
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
construction
of
it.
that
it
has
to
be
read
meaning
“only
white
people,
a
white
person.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
following
up
on
justice
blackmun's
point,
as
i
understand
it,
the
record
does
not
tell
us
the
race
of
your
individual
clients.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
conceivable
that
two
or
three
of
them
are
from
china
and
the
rest
are
white
persons.
and,
i
take
it,
if
the
presumption
is
decisive,
some
of
your
clients
will
win
and
some
will
lose
because
some
of
them
will
be
white
persons
who
get
the
--
who
have
the
adverse
effect
of
the
statute
and
others
will
not
be
hurt
by
the
statute
and
they
may
well
win.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so,
some
of
your
clients--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cullison,
i
realize
that
this
question
bears
on
mr.
smith's
side
of
the
case,
as
argued
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yours
is
between
which
law
applies.
but,
going
back
to
the
statute,
section
194,
do
you
think
it
would
be
possible
to
say
that
a
state
is
not
a
white
person,
whatever
might
be
the
situation
as
to
individuals.
you're
here
representing
the
state
of
iowa.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the--
section
194
refers
to
an
indian
may
be
a
party
on
one
side
and
a
white
person
on
the
other.
do
you
think
it
would
be
possible
for
a
court
to
hold
that
however
the
term
“white
person”
is
interpreted
with
respect
to
individuals,
it
has
not
application
to
a
sovereign
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it's,
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
part
of
your
position,
but,
i
take
it,
in--
because
you're
on
this
side
of
the
case
you
might
be
sympathetic
to
mr.
smith's
position
so
far
as
individuals
are
concerned
and
maybe
you're
not
taking
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
veeder,
do
you
understand
that
anything
that
you've
argued
is
something
we're
supposed
to
decide,
and
the
two
questions
we've
granted
certiorari?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
granted
certiorari,
as
i
understand
it,
to
decide
whether
section
194
applies
and
whether
state
or
federal
law
applies.
i
don't
understand
the
relevance
of
your
argument
to
either
of
those
questions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
your
argument,
what
you're
saying
is
you
don't
really
care
how
we
answer
the
two
questions--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
beale,
isn't
there--
if
you
look
at
the
reason
for
the
provision,
i
suppose
it's
to--
sort
of
a
protective
provision--
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
indian
might
be
at
a
disadvantage
in
litigation
with
a
white
person,
but
is--
does
the
same
disadvantage
apply
when
the
united
states
are
doing
the
litigating
for
the
indian?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
beale,
do
you
think
that
section
16
of
the
statute
as
construed
in
the
perryman
case
is
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
having
been
construed
that
way
some
years
ago,
aren't
we
bound
to
respect
that
instruction
just
as
much
as
if
congress
had
written
it
in
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
guess
they
have
some
difficulty
under
a
standing,
the
rationale,
but
it's
alright
to
protect
the
indians
from
robbery
by
whites
but
not
by
a
fugitive
slave
that
i
think
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
sounds
to
me
like,
although
they
gave
the
reason,
they
really
just
read
the
statute
literally.
what
it
boils
down
to,
they
just
said
“white
person”
means
white
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
they
gave
a
reason
that's
most
unpersuasive
for
doing
that,
other
than
the
fact
that
it
says
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
beale,
your
time
is
running.
are
you
trying
to
get
to
the
choice
of
law
question?
