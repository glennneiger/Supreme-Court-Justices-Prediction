they
--
there's
nothing
in

well,
whose
constitutional
rights
--
the
equal
protection
clause
just
requires
a
state
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
insofar
as
it's
component
of
the
fifth
amendment
requires
the
federal
government
to
grant
everybody
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
it
doesn't
confront
individual's
personal
rights,
does
it?
justice

we
have
a
personal
right
of
the
exercise
of
free

right
if
brought

in
a
criminal
court
to
the

of

and
so

everybody
has
that
each

what
is
there
in
the

clause
that

any
such

that
