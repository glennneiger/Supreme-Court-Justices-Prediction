justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
mean
as
secretary
that's
the
way
he
described
her?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
it
would
make
a
difference
if
her
task
were
secretarial
exclusively
or
administrative
assistant
at
least
impart?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
some
of
us
were
in
dissent
in
bivens
and
do
you
think
that
blocks
us
in
and
makes
us
necessarily
unsympathetic
to
your
posture
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
know,
we
do
try
to
be
individually
consistent
and
what
i'm
asking
is,
is
there
any
escape
for
those
of
us
who
were
in
dissent
in
bivens?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
you
just
made
reference
to
a
number
of
cases
in
this
area
whether
the
courts
had
gone
in
your
favor.
so,
there
is
some
litigation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
wasn't
decided
by
the
en
banc
court,
was
it?
