ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
sana
shtasel
appearing
for
the
petitioner
in
the
case
this
morning.
the
case
before
you
today
arises
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
basic
question
is
whether
a
cause
of
action
from
money
damages
may
be
implied
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
redress
sex
discrimination
in
federal
employment.
if
that
question
is
answered
in
the
affirmative,
this
court
then
must
determine
whether
respondent
is
nonetheless
absolutely
immune
from
suit
by
virtue
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
simple
and
stark.
petitioner
was
employed
by
respondent
then
a
united
states
congressman
for
a
six-month
period
in
1974.
despite
the
fact
that
petitioner
was
an
able,
energetic,
and
extremely
capable
secretary
as
attested
to
by
the
respondent
in
his
letter
of
dismissal,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
in
this
case
at
pages
6
and
7,
respondent
dismissed
petitioner
solely,
explicitly,
and
expressly
because
he
wanted
a
man
rather
than
a
woman
to
fill
that
position.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
the
title
of
the
petition
--
of
the
position
mr.
justice
blackmun
was
deputy
administrative
assistant
but
it
is
the
functions
of
the
job
that
are
in
question
here
and
no
one
has
ever
contended
that
the
petitioner
did
anything
other
than
secretarial
functions.
that
is
exactly
how
her
job
was
described
in
the
letter
terminating
her
employment
which
is
the
only
thing
we
have
on
the
record
in
this
case.
petitioner
therefore
brought
suit
allegedly
--
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
it
might
make
a
difference
mr.
justice
when
we
get
to
the
question
of
the
operation
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
it
should
not
make
a
difference
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
has
a
cause
of
action
under
the
fifth
amendment.
whether
however,
her
job
functions
would
be
so
integral
to
the
congressmen's
legislative
functions
that
the
employment
relationship
should
nonetheless
be
covered
with
absolute
immunity
is
a
question
which
must
be
addressed
there.
our
position
however
is
that
there
is
no
way
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
can
apply
to
the
--
to
a
low
level
non-policymaking
clerical
employee.
i
might
say
that
this
case
arises
on
a
12
(b)
(6)
motion
to
dismiss
so
that
our
contentions
here
for
the
--
in
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
must
be
taken
to
be
the
ones
applicable.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
that
is
in
the
record
mr.
justice
white.
her
salary
was
$18,000.00
a
year.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
it
sounds
like
it
your
honor
but
one
when
consults
the
report
of
the
clerk
of
the
house
for
that
period
in
time,
it's
quite
clear
that
some
75
other
representatives
had
secretaries,
personal
secretaries,
executive
secretaries,
all
making
that
kind
of
salary
and
indeed
there
are
other
cases
where
members
employed
persons
called
secretaries
who
made
more
than
the
administrative
assistant
that
they
also
employ.
ms.

ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
she
was
employed
from
february
through
july
in
1974.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
that
is
true
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
my
understanding
is
that
they
are
allotted
a
maximum
of
18
slots
which
can
be
filled
at
their
discretion
and
with
salaries
at
their
discretion.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
that
is
correct.
petitioner,
following
her
termination,
brought
suit
a
legend
that
she
had
been
a
victim
of
sex
discrimination
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
premising
jurisdiction
upon
28
u.s.c.
section
1331
(a).
the
district
court
dismissed
this
case
holding
that
plaintiff
had
no
private
cause
of
action.
a
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
of
appeals
reversed
on
that
issue
and
then
proceeded
to
canvass
all
the
related
constitutional
issues.
it
held
as
had
the
district
court
that
no
immunity
doctrine
would
bar
the
suit.
rehearing
en
banc
was
held
to
assess
whether
the
doctrines
of
legislative
immunity
and
political
question
which
i
might
add
had
been
raised
for
the
first
time
by
the
panel
were
applicable
to
this
case.
the
en
banc
court
however
did
not
decide
that
question,
rather
it
decided
an
issue
that
had
not
been
briefed
before
the
panel
had
been
conceded
by
respondent
at
the
panel
and
had
neither
been
raised
by
the
respondent
on
rehearing
nor
briefed
by
him
in
that
proceeding.
the
court
held
that
an
implied
cause
of
action
does
not
arise
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution,
and
accordingly
that
petitioner
should
have
no
remedy
whatever
to
vindicate
her
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
the
validity
of
that
decision
is
the
first
question
for
this
court's
determination
today.
for
the
reason
stated
in
our
briefs
to
this
court,
this
case
is
controlled
by
bivens
against
six
unknown
named
agents
of
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics.
in
bivens,
this
court
held
first
that
the
petitioner
had
a
private
cause
of
action
for
damages
arising
directly
under
the
fourth
amendment.
second,
that
the
federal
right
was
independent
from
any
state
right
that
might
be
implicated,
and
third
that
money
damages
were
remedial
mechanism
normally
available
in
the
federal
courts.
in
the
seven-and-half
years
since
bivens
was
decided,
nine
courts
of
appeals
and
countless
district
courts
have
applied
bivens
to
constitutional
amendments
other
than
the
fourth
and
to
federal
officials
other
than
narcotics
agents.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i'd
be
delighted
if
the
dissents
bivens
were
persuaded
by
the
cause
of
action
should
be
applied
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
think
that
the
rational
of
the
bivens'
majority
and
the
rational
of
the
courts
that
have
applied
bivens
in
the
succeeding
years
is
sufficient
to
suggest
that
we
can
apply
a
cause
of
action
under
bivens
here.
indeed
as
well,
there
are
other
factors
in
this
case
which
make
it
perhaps
a
stronger
case
than
bivens
for
the
implication
of
a
cause
of
action
from
money
damages
under
the
constitution.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
i
would
suggest
one
mr.
justice
blackmun.
one
of
the
concerns
was
that
congress
had
not
expressly
spoken
on
the
question
in
the
fourth
amendment
case.
in
this
case,
congress
has
a
formatively
declared
in
5
u.s.c.
7151
that
employees
of
members
of
congress
are
not
to
be
discriminated
against.
accordingly
to
the
extent
that
this
court
needs
to
look
or
wants
to
look
the
congressional
declaration
in
the
area
is
a
path.
as
a
second
possibility,
mr.
justice,
there
were
some
concern
in
by
the
bivens'
dissenters
that
the
federal
courts
would
be
subjected
to
an
avalanche
of
cases.
indeed,
there
have
been
almost
eight
years
of
federal
litigation
in
this
area
and
known
for
it
other
than
the
en
banc
for
prolong
has
suggested
that
there's
a
problem
of
judicial
and
manageability
in
this
area.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
there's
extensive
litigation
in
the
area.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
our
argument
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
pardon
me,
is
that
congress
cannot
mandate
no
remedy
for
violations
of
constitutional
rights
and
indeed
in
this
case
it
is
never
suggested
that
there
should
be
no
juridical
remedy
for
this
kind
of
violation.
indeed,
it
has
not
brought
congressional
employees
under
the
ambit
of
title
vii
and
it
could
certainly
enact
legislation
which
would
so
provide
and
indeed
even
protect
its
own
members
from
the
possibility
of
personal
liability
which
has
been
done
in
other
context.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
in
bivens,
there
was
no
congressional
policy
stated
in
the
area.
in
this
one,
in
this
case,
at
most
we
have
a
congressional
hortatory
statute
which
declares
what
the
policy
of
the
united
states
is
to
be.
moving
along,
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
below
does
stand
alone
in
the
face
of
this
authority
and
in
doing
so
in
refusing
to
imply
a
constitutional
cause
of
action
the
en
banc
court
did
erroneously
look
to
the
criteria
enumerated
in
cort
against
ash
for
implication
of
remedies
from
federal
statutes.
the
respondent
reaches
the
same
result
by
different
root.
he
uses
the
proviso
of
bivens
that
special
factors
might
counsel
hesitation
in
the
absence
of
affirmative
action
by
congress
and
argues
that
some
seven
special
factors
counsel
hesitation
here.
each
of
the
court
criteria
and
each
of
the
special
factors
relied
upon
by
the
respondent
are
dressed
in
our
brief.
none
of
them
either
alone
or
in
combination
justifies
dismissal
of
petitioner's
complaint
in
this
case.
we
would
suggest
that
the
respondent
is
correct
to
the
extent
that
he
acknowledges
that
it
is
bivens
that
controls
this
case.
as
i
just
mentioned
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
think
the
court
below
erred
in
relying
on
cort
against
ash
because
those
criteria
are
irrelevant
when
a
constitutional
right
rather
than
a
right
created
by
a
federal
statute
is
an
issue.
for
the
reasons,
we
have
outlined
however
at
pages
26
to
36
of
our
opening
brief
application
of
the
court
criteria
would
require
recognition
of
a
private
cause
of
action
nonetheless
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
yes,
sir.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
i
don't
think
that
the
analysis
would
be
different
under
the
fourth
amendment
as
under
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
implication
--
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
that
is
true
mr.
justice
white
but
many
classifications
or
at
least
several
have
been
deemed
to
this
court
to
rise
to
the
level
of
being
constitutionally
safeguarded
and
thus
subject
to
the
equal
protections
scrutiny.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
what
the
courts
have
held
however
and
indeed
this
is
the
constitutional
jurisprudence
which
has
come
down
from
marbury
against
madison
is
that
when
constitutional
rights
are
invaded
as
opposed
to
other
kinds
of
rights
to
federal
courts
--
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
i
believe
the
very
purpose
of
the
bill
of
rights
--
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
indeed,
you're
going
to
the
heart
of
the
case
mr.
justice
stewart
in
suggesting
--
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
--
that
constitutional
rights,
must
be
implied
or
remedies
for
them
from
the
constitution
because
without
that
implication
of
the
cause
of
action
those
rights
would
be
reduced
to
meaningless
rhetoric.
there
would
be
no
enforcement
mechanism
for
insuring
those
guarantees.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
again,
i
think
the
answer
mr.
justice
powell
is
yes
as
regards
the
cause
of
action
aspect
of
the
case
before
you
this
morning.
if
there
were
to
be
any
bar
to
trial
on
the
merits
it
would
have
to
come
under
any
official
immunity
which
might
be
invoked
under
the
rules
governing
immunity
in
that
area
which
are
somewhat
different
from
those
at
this
point
in
time
governing
the
operation
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
in
the
legislative
context.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
i'm
frank
to
say
that
if
he
were
relieved
for
reasons
which
were
invidiously
discriminatory
then
the
answer
would
have
to
be
yes.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
yes
sir.
and
i
think
the
cause
of
action
that
we're
asking
for
this
morning
would
be
the
same.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
apologize.
i
missed
the
first
sentence
of
your
question.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
confess
it's
not
a
case
that
i'm
familiar
with
and
can't
speculate
upon
it
on
those
facts
but
i
would
suggest
that
in
the
context
of
the
bill
of
rights
guarantee
that
bivens
would
be
the
law
of
the
case
at
this
moment
in
time.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
i
think
in
that
context
mr.
chief
justice
other
kinds
of
balancing
factors
come
into
play.
what
you
were
talking
about
there
are
political
concerns
which
might
govern
action
in
this
area
because
indeed
elective
representatives
having
historical
and
constitutional
function
to
represent
sort
of
constituencies
and
to
represent
certain
positions.
in
that
context,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
case
of
invidious
discrimination
nor
are
we
talking
about
a
case
where
performance
or
job
relatedness
is
the
issue.
that
is
quite
different
from
a
case
were
based
on
nothing
more
and
member
of
congress
explicitly
stated
that
only
a
man
could
fill
a
position
that
without
question
has
there
typically
been
held
by
women.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
to
be
sure
mr.
justice
white,
what
we
are
talking
about
at
that
point
is
trial
issues
and
proof
issues
rather
than
as
statement
of
a
cause
of
action
in
the
federal
court
system.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
in
that
context
mr.
chief
justice
i
have
to
answer
yes.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
under
title
vii
members
of
the
executive
branch
staff
are
covered.
it
is
the
judicial
and
legislative
staffs
which
are
not
in
the
competitive
service
which
are
exempted
from
the
operation
of
title
vii.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
none
on
its
face
mr.
justice
powell.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
the
congress
in
its
wisdom
did
not
exempt
those
particular
staff
people.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
title
vii
in
the
executive
branch
context
applies
to
members
of
the
civil
service
which
have
been
defined
under
the
appropriate
statute
to
mean
appointees
of
the
executive,
legislative
and
judicial
branches.
it
is
then
when
one
looks
the
definition
of
the
competitive
service
that
one
finds
the
restriction
which
applies
to
the
legislative
branch.
ms.

expressly
exempted

ms.

the

is
not
exempted.
ms.

f.
shtasel

is
appointed
however.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
in
that
case
mr.
chief
justice,
the
question
might
be
resolved
by
operation
of
separation
of
powers
doctrine
which
would
confer
a
textual
commitment
to
another
branch
of
the
federal
government.
that
is
not
the
case
here
where
there
is
no
such
textual
commitment
to
another
branch
of
the
government
nor
other
any
other
of
the
political
questions
separation
of
powers
kinds
of
formulations
which
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
the
instant
situation.
i
think
it
appropriate
to
turn
to
the
question
of
speech
or
debate
immunity
at
this
point
in
time.
petitioner
argues
that
the
absolute
immunity
conferred
by
that
clause
does
not
protect
the
respondent
here.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
no,
sir.
it
was
not.
it
was
only
decided
by
the
panel.
this
court
has
interpreted
the
parameters
of
the
clause
on
nine
separate
occasions.
all
of
these
are
discussed
in
our
brief.
i
think
it
appropriate
to
suggest
that
the
court
has
with
undeviating
consistency
articulated
principles
which
have
not
waived
almost
over
100
years.
these
are
several.
first,
that
the
clause
has
finite
limits,
second,
that
its
scope
is
to
be
confined
to
activities
which
are
within
of
legitimate,
legislative
sphere;
and
third,
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
not
a
grant
of
personal
prerogative.
instead,
its
purpose
is
to
insure
the
independence
of
the
legislative
branch
and
as,
as
discussed
a
moment
ago.
it
is
indeed
the
ultimate
guarantor
of
separation
of
powers.
the
court
has
made
clear
that
there
are
many
cases,
many
activities
regularly
performed
by
a
congressmen
or
somehow
tangentially
related
to
his
performance
which
are
nonetheless
outside
the
scope
of
the
clause.
it
is
our
contention
that
firing
a
secretary
who
no
one
has
ever
contended
had
policymaking
or
legislative
responsibilities
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
protection
conferred
by
that
clause.
to
hold
otherwise,
would
be
to

mr.
justice
rehnquist,
our
position
is
that
the
court
need
not
go
so
far
in
this
particular
case.
we
--
it's
our
position
that
under
no
circumstance
can
a
speech
or
debate
clause
protect
the
low
level
employee.
there
are
two
--
ms.

f.
shtasel
there
are
two
ways
or
two
means
of
analysis
that
i
suggest
would
be
appropriate
in
devising
limiting
principles
for
the
operation
of
the
clause.
one
of
them
would
be
on
the
basis
of
the
kind
of
job
functions
at
issue
and
this
court
has
often
times
made
distinction
based
on
the
nature
of
job
responsibilities.
a
second
analytical
framework,
indeed
broader
one,
which
the
court
doesn't
mean
to
reach
today
is
to
suggest
that
this
kind
of
invidious
discrimination
is
so
egregious
that
under
no
circumstance
could
any
employee
of
a
congressman
and
thus
the
congressman
himself
be
protected
by
virtue
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
to
that
effect.

the
checks
are

but
the
statute
is
clear
that
that

responsibilities

ms.

that's
correct.
ms.

f.

that's
right,
which
is
exactly
why
this
runs
us
to
fifth
amendment
violation.
ms.
sana
f.
shtasel
that's
correct.
ms.

shtasel
i
think
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
what
you
were
suggesting
falls
in
the
nature
of
selection
criteria
for
the
job.
it
does
not
fall
into
the
category
of
discrimination
based
upon
sex.
that's
a
distinction
we
have
to
make
for
this
purposes.
i
notice
my
time
has
expired
mr.
chief
justice.
apparently,
i
submit
this
case.
