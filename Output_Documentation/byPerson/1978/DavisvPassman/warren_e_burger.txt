we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
davis
--
shirley
davis
against
passman.
ms.
shtasel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
salary
may
be
fixed
by
each
individual
member
of
the
house
in
senate
without
any
standards,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
some
cases
they
level
it
off
and
divide
the
work
among
several
people
and
another
cases
they
have
a
very
high
salary
of
secretary,
is
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they're
not
allotted
18
positions
and
x
thousands
of
dollars
and
they
may
spread
the
salaries
as
they
wish,
is
that
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
shtasel
let
me
add
some
variation,
hypothetical;
it's
a
variation
of
mr.
justice
powell's
question.
i
don't
know
how
many
legislative
assistants
the
president
has
but
let's
assume
he
has
five
of
them
and
they
are
all
men,
and
he
calls
one
of
the
five
in
and
says
now
you're
doing
splendid
work,
i
have
no
complaints
at
all
but
in
this
modern
day
we've
got
to
have
a
woman
at
least
one
woman
and
the
legislative
relations
with
congress
and
therefore
i'm
sorry
but
i
have
to
replace
you
with
a
woman.
cause
of
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
my
question
was
explicitly,
what
if
there
is
a
cause
of
action,
would
there
it
not
to
whether
he
might
win
or
lose
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
permission
recites
that
he
serves
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president
--
i
think
with
all
presidential
appointees.

justice

chief
justice
warren
e.

well
mr.
gear.
i
think
your
time
has
entirely
expired

you,

the
case
is
submitted.
