mr.
a.
richard
gear
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
submit
that
a
bivens
cause
of
action
should
not
be
implied
from
the
fifth
amendment
but
that
it
should
be
limited
to
a
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
situation
or
physical
intrusion
situations.
this
arrest
and
detention
of
search
and
seizure
situations
are
situations
were
at
the
power
of
government
and
its
police
power
is
clearly
an
abuse
upon
the
private
citizen.
in
employment
situation
such
as
we
have
here,
it's
much
more
like
an
act
between
two
private
citizens
rather
than
an
act
that
has
a
greater
effect
upon
the
citizen
because
it
is
a
power
of
government.
we
submit
that
further
that
in
this
case
there
are
special
factors
which
counsel
hesitation
in
creating
cause
of
action.
the
first
of
those
special
factors
is
that
we
believe
it
a
flood
of
new
cases
will
overly
burden
the
judiciary
because
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
clause
is
broad
and
apparently
is
getting
broader.
the
court
is
familiar
that
civil
rights
filings
have
risen
from
around
296
in
1961
to
over
13,000
in
1977.
they
dropped
couple
percent
in
1978
but
--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
it's
--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
it
apparently
covers
our
employment
cases.
it
did
not
cover
prisoner
cases
as
i
understand
but
it
does
cover
employment
cases.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
agree
with
you
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
that's
right.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
that's
true
sir
but
we
feel
that
if
cause
of
action
is
--
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
a.
richard
gear
that's
correct
your
honor.
we
feel
that
the
flood
of
new
lawsuits
upon
federal
issues
will
inhibit
federal
action
and
also
inhibit
federal
employment.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
a.
richard
gear
well,
sir,
every
circuit
court
has
considered
the
bivens
type
cases
and
they're
moving
up
to
you
sir.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
well,
i
don't
know
the
exact
number
sir.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
alright.
we're
concerned
that
federal
employment
and
federal
decision
for
being
here,
which
is
about
a
series
of
personal
judgments
because
the
ordinary
federal
official
or
federal
employ
we
can't
handle
the
personal
judgment.
you'll
be
going
bankrupt.
it
will
have
officers
of
the
court
going
satisfying
judgments
out
of
the
--
let's
say
of
the
home
of
other
of
a
federal
official
who's
been
victim
of
some
fifth
amendment
cause
of
action.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
think
so
sir,
yes.
yes.
of
course,
in
this
case
congress
we
believe
has
clearly
not
intended
to
create
an
act
a
cause
of
action
in
the
federal
court
system
against
itself.
congress
did
exempt
itself
and
the
judiciary
for
the
personal
staff
employees
of
congressmen
and
of
the
judiciary
when
it
passed
civil
rights
act
amendments
in
1972.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
well,
that
of
course
is
the
fifth
amendment
connection
of
the
case
(voice
overlap).
mr.
a.
richard
gear
but
congressman
or
i
don't
know
you
have
to
ask
the
plaintiff
on
that
sir.
i
really
don't
know
but
this
is
one
reason
what
we
feel
that
the
exemption
to
the
civil
rights
act
is
very
important
because
the
--
under
the
civil
rights
act
federal
employees
have
cause
of
action
aren't
permitted
to
sue
the
particular
individual
involved
by
suing
the
government.
there's
no
question
about
personal
liability
as
i
understand
it,
for
federal
employees
who
are
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act.
the
house
of
representatives
had
no
policy
against
any
kind
of
discrimination
until
it
passed
the
clause
9
of
its
house
rule
43
in
january
of
1975,
six
months
after
the
discharge
of
miss
davis
and
either
man
have
passed
just
an
internal
resolution
prohibiting
sex
discrimination.
at
no
time,
as
i
view
it,
has
either
house
or
congress
put
before
the
judiciary
a
cause
of
action
in
the
statute
permitting
the
judiciary
to
consider
cases
against
it
on
the
basis
of
sex
discrimination
or
fifth
amendment
problems.
we
have
both
the
house
and
the
senate
--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i'm
suggesting
there
should
be
no
cause
of
action
against
congress
until
congress
suggest
that
sir
because
we
have
separation
of
power
principles
involved
here
which
is
in
another
of
the
special
factor
we
believe
should
counsel
hesitation
in
this
case.
it's
that,
we
feel
that
if
congress
were
going
to
appear
a
cause
of
action
against
itself
it
certainly
would've
done
more
than
there's
been
apparent
here
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
may
i
say
this,
sir.
the
fifth
amendment
would
apply
to
congress
insofar
as
the
house
can
discipline
its
own
members.
i
submit
that
separation
of
powers
principles
would
prohibit
the
judiciary
from
applying
the
fifth
amendment
against
members
of
congress
in
these
employment
situations.
congress
is
not
immune
from
its
own
house
discipline
and
of
course
the
members
of
congress
are
not
immune
from
voters
deciding
that
given
individual
should
be
replaced
and
given
individual
should
be
elected.
well,
the
--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
well,
your
honor
we
believe
it
does.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
or
speech
or
debate
clause
in
separation
of
powers
principle
of
the
same
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
exactly
right
your
honor
and
this
again
is
another
special
factor
in
this
case
which
is
the
most
unusual
case
i
believe.
i
mean
in
this
case
which
puts
counsel's
hesitation
in
the
implication
of
a
fifth
amendment
cause
of
action.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
think
you'd
have
a
cause
of
action
to
do
that.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
yes,
to
declare
such
a
statute.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
well,
i
believe
it
would
be
sir.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
think
that
would
lie
all
right
but
i
think
that
you
get
into
separation
of
power
situations
here
that
even
if
the
court
were
to
expand
bivens
to
other
fifth
amendment
actions
what
i'm
saying
that
in
this
case
separation
of
power
considerations
prohibit
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
well,
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
question,
your
honor.
but
if
the
classification
principle
enunciated
here
is
the
correct
principle
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
well,
--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
the
executive
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
your
honor,
i
do
want
to
get
into
the
speech
or
debate
clause
considerations
here,
if
i
may.
we
consider
that
the
legislative
personal
assistance,
the
personal
staff
employees
of
members
of
congress
are,
and
the
relationships
between
congress
and
these
personal
employees
are
within
the
legitimate
sphere
of
legislative
activity.
the
aides
of
congressmen
and
congresswoman
assist
them
in
speech
writing,
they
assist
them
in
preparing
for
and
discussing
how
to
vote,
they
counsel
them
on
how
to
vote.
they
help
them
introduced
material
to
committee
hearings,
they
review
transcripts
of
committee
hearings,
and
they
are
really
truly
are
involved
in
various
stages
of
legislative
decision
making.
in
the
gravel
case,
the
importance
of
legislative
personal
staff
was
recognized
that
the
court
said
that
that
it
was
impossible
for
modern
day
legislator
to
perform
legislative
tasks
without
aids
and
assistance.
it
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
day-to-day
work
of
the
legislative
staff
was
so
critical
to
the
legislative
performance
that
the
staff
members
are
alter
egos
of
the
members
of
congress.
in
gravel,
it
was
found
that
the
aide
even
share
the
immunity
of
senator
gravel.
we
submit
that
the
personal
staffs
of
congressmen
very
like
the
personal
staff
of
the
judges
are
selected
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
a
legislator
in
performing
the
legislative
tasks
that
when
a
legislator
interviews
an
individual
or
considers
whether
to
retain
an
individual
from
employment,
what
he's
really
asking
is
how
can
this
person
help
me
perform
my
legislative
roles?
it's
a
careful
decision
because
the
person
that
is
selected
to
be
on
the
legislative
staff
may
share
that
legislator's
speech
and
debate
immunity,
that
person
may
be
immune
as
to
third
person.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
numerically,
i
--
well,
numerically
at
that
time
that
the
legislator
did
not
have
the
immense
staffs
that
they
had
today.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
i
would
assume
that's
correct.
i
think
they
rode
on
the
horse
to
congress
now
but
the
constitution
does
develop
--
mr.
a.
richard
gear
that's
right.
you
know
but
of
course
the
aides
and
the
personal
assistance
of
the
legislators
have
themselves
been
found
to
share
this
immunity
and
so
the
employees
of
the
congressman
must
be
considered
in
speech
and
debate
clause
situation
regardless
of
what
the
original
make-up
and
function
in
congress
was
at
that
time
anyway.
but
again
the
basic
question
that
legislator
asked
when
he
hires
one
of
these
individuals
is,
how
can
this
person
help
perform
my
legislative
function?
and
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
personal
staffs
of
congressmen
are
assembled,
they
are
brought
together
in
a
very
broad
legislative
context
which
context
should
be
immune.
it
should
be
immune
exclusive
by
the
court,
it's
not
immune
from
scrutiny
by
the
house's
themselves
and
it's
not
immune
from
the
voters.
i
want
to
examine
with
you
the
effects
of
not
conferring
speech
and
debate
immunity
in
this
case
and
the
effects
of
not
considering
the
separation
of
powers.
we
will
have
time
consuming
by
burdens
of
lawsuits
that
will
be
inflicted
on
congressmen.
they
will
be
involved
in
extensive
discovery
procedures
that
case
alone
is
four-and-half
years
old.
we
feel
that
if
congressmen
are
made
to
answer
before
the
judiciary,
before
the
--
for
the
personnel
decisions
that
is
going
to
have
a
chilling
effect
on
their
personal
decisions,
that
congressmen
will
be
forced
to
retain
in
competent
aides
when
they
would
wish
they
can
get
rid
of
them
but
they're
scared
to
for
fear
of
lawsuits.
mr.
a.
richard
gear
that's
true,
your
honor
but
we
feel
that
their
interests
really
are
concern
more
on
the
fair
employment
practices
aspects
of
the
society
problems
today
than
they
are
on
the
true
separation
of
powers
problem
which
i
think
accord
this,
if
you
understand
me
on
that.
if
this
cause
of
action
is
permitted
and
speech
and
debate
clause
immunity
doesn't
apply
we're
going
to
have
lawsuits
of
congressmen
for
fees
of
a
higher,
the
discharge
of
employees
the
failure
to
promote,
failure
to
grant
wage
increases.
there
may
be
hundreds
of
applicants.
we're
not
talking
about
a
few
discharges.
they
were
talking
about
hundreds
of
applicants
who
desire
to
work
on
the
staffs
of
congressman.
the
employment
decisions
that
will
be
potentially
judiciable
and
which
--
which
cause
of
action
would
be
created
would
be
an
immense
number
because
this
had
might
the
pentagon
papers
episode
or
the
criminal
situation
the
(inaudible)
the
everyday
employment
decisions
that
occur
in
congress,
and
for
this
reason
we
feel
that
there
would
be
a
very
improper
injection
of
this
court
into
the
judicial
process.
it
would
mean
that
members
of
congress
would
have
to
get
familiar
with
statistical
experts,
industrial
psychologists.
they'll
have
to
worry
about
class
actions
every
congressman
is
going
to
need
personnel
expert
and
labor
lawyer
to
operate.
we
feel
that
this
would
impair
the
integrity
of
the
legislative
process
and
would
be
both
unwarranted
invasion
of
the
principle
separation
of
powers
and
they
restrict
the
view
of
the
speech
and
debate
immunity.
that's
all
i
have
your
honor
unless
there
are
questions.
thank
you
very
much.
