i
ask
you
a
question?
would
your
bivens'

be
applicable
to

f.
powell,

do
you
think
if
georgette
powell
were
relieved
do
you
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
president?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
the
president
had
written
to
him
that
he
preferred
to
have
a
talented
woman
in
his
position
and
complimented
him
only
as
congressman
passman
did
that
would
be
fairly
analogous,
wouldn't
it?
justice

f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
another
question,
what
does

to

in
the
white
house?

lewis
f.

f.
powell,
jr.

justice
lewis
f.

even
this
precisely
one
of
the
arguments
that

made
in
dissent
in
bivens.
justice

mr.

will
the
same
