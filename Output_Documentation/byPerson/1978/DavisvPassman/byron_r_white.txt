what
was
her
salary
is
that
in
the
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
sounds
like
a
little
some
other
than
a
low
level
clerical
employee,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
this,
1970?
justice
byron
r.
white
4.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
reliance
is
on
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
exclusively?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
view
that
the
equal
protection
clause
even
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
confers
personal
rights?
doesn't
it
just
have
to
do
with
classifications?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
really
provisions
of
the
constitution.
the
first,
fourth
and
the
sixth
amendments
among
others
that
specifically
and
explicitly
confer
personal
protections
freedoms
and
sometimes
rights,
free
press,
free
speech,
free
exercise
or
religion;
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
however
just
has
to
do
with
classifications,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
counsel
if
it
--
i
suppose
if
to
say
that
--
that
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
there
would
be
a
fifth
amendment
cause
of
action
and
still
say
that
a
cause
of
action
hasn't
been
stated.
and
even
if
one
is
been
stated,
you
might
lose
the
case;
you
don't
need
to
answer
the
chief
justice
that
it
is
because
--
just
because
the
president
might
win
the
case
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
cause
of
action
available
under
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
certainly
many
employees
of
the
executive
branch
are
expressly
exempted
aren't
they,
is
the
military
exempted?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
not
an
employee
of
former
congressman
passman.
she
was
an
employee
of
the
federal
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
exactly
right.
why
wasn't
a
suit
properly
brought
against
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
there
never
should
be
a
cause
of
action
under
the
fifth
amendment
until
or
unless
congress
indicates
that
there
should
be
some
kind
of
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
speech
or
debate
clause
take
care
of
all
of
your
concerns
in
this
regard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
suppose
we
disagreed
with
you
on
that
of
course
there
is
an
area
to
which
this
speech
or
debate
clause
applies
and
that
why
would
--
whatever
area
that
is
why
wouldn't
that
be
inadequate
answer
to
your
separation
powers
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
it
certainly
wouldn't
protect
speech
or
debate
clause
certainly
protects
congress
against
invasions
why
either
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
counsel
that
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
i
thought
was
preventing
me
from
engaging
in
some
activities
and
the
federal
government
was
threatening
to
enforce
it
against
me,
at
least
there
was
a
case
of
controversy
and
i
went
into
a
federal
court
and
filed
the
complaint
saying
that
asking
for
declaratory
adjustment
to
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment
either
due
process
clause
or
the
equal
protection
component.
now,
where
would
i
get
my
cause
of
action
to
do
that
or
would
i
have
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
where
would
i
get
my
cause
of
action?
isn't
that
a
direct
action
in
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that
would
lie
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes
but
in
my
example
there
would
be
no
federal
statute
that
extended
the
cause
of
action
to
me
to
sue
the
executive
branch
and
yet
you
say
i
can
go
into
the
court
and
have
that
court
enjoin
the
executive
branch?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
well,
that's
a
different
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
people
enforcing
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
some
congressmen
here
who
think
otherwise,
which
they
filed
a
new
amicus
brief
on
the
other
side.
