justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
some
of
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
blackmun
cut
the
other
way
in
the
sense
that
although
the
statute
is
on
the
books
the
general
kind
of
hortatory
statute,
congress
is
quite
carefully
considered
whether
it
wanted
to
make
its
members
subject
to
say
title
vi,
the
way
the
executive
branch
members
are
or
whether
it
wanted
to
subject
its
members
to
any
particular
strictures
in
their
hiring
and
firing
and
they
simply
have
not
done
it.
they've
considered
it
and
rejected
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
proposition
may
be
entirely
some
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it's
really
makes
your
case
a
stronger
one
than
bivens
as
you
suggested
to
mr.
justice
blackmun.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
pacific
tel.
&
tel.
where
their
provision
in
constitution
guaranteeing
to
each
state
are
republican
form
of
government
was
held
to
be
not
judicially
enforceable?
that
certainly
is
an
example
of
a
constitutional
provision
which
this
court
has
said,
it's
in
the
constitution
but
there
just
doesn't
any
private
right
of
action
pacific
tel.
&
tel.
against
fuller,
you
know
long
time
ago.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
were
saying
that
you
know
you
can't
have
a
right
without
a
remedy
in
that
sort
of
thing,
how
about
the
case
of
pacific
telephone
and
telegraph
versus,
i
think
it
was,
fuller
decided
about
1910
where
this
court
said
that
although
the
constitution
does
say
every
state
shall
be
guaranteed
to
republican
form
of
government
nonetheless,
the
people
on
oregon
who
were
challenging
the
referendum
provision
were
told
that
cause
of
action
--
that
provision
simply
isn't
judicially
enforceable.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
bivens
is
a
lot
later
than
that
one.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
the
president
presumably
signed
the
bill,
is
there
--
is
title
vii
applied
the
executive
branch
applicable
only
that
their
competitive
service
or
is
it
applied
to
anyone
who
will
--
gets
a
pay
check
from
the
federal
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
but
the
competitive
service
i
would
assume
is
probably
doesn't
cover
top
white
house
employees
or
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
or
people
like
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
it
be
any
worst
to
fire
a
secretary
on
a
basis
of
sex
discrimination
than
an
administrative
assistant
who
have
policymaking
responsibilities?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
your
second
line
of
analysis
i
presume
that
if
in
my
annual
search
for
law
works
if
i
were
to
interview
women
and
find
women
or
woman
who
felt
that
some
of
my
votes
in
cases
involving
women
weren't
all
that
satisfactory
to
earn
and
felt
she
would
have
some
difficulty
working
from
me
for
that
reason
and
she
could
prove
that
i
didn't
hire
her
for
that
reason,
she
would
have
an
action
against
me.
