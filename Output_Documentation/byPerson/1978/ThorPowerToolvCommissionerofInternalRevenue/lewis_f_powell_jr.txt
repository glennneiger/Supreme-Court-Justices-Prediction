justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
saying
that
the
taxpayer
has
used
consistently
the
lower
of
cost
or
market
method
for
valuing
inventories?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right
and
when
you
use
the
term
net
realizable
value
that's
not
inconsistent
with
the
cost
or
market
method?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
smith
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
before
you
go
on,
didn't
the
tax
court
find
that
generally
accepted
accounting
practice
required
what
was
done
by
this
taxpayer,
and
that
the
sec
also
would
have
required
it
in
a
registration
statement?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
promoted
my
question
was,
not
that
i
was
suggesting
there
may
never
be
a
variation
in
between
tax
requirements
and
accounting
requirements.
it
was
your
suggestion
as
i
understood
it
that
the
taxpayer
had
sort
of
more
less
pulled
this
out
because
it
wanted
it
and
that
they
were
not
in
accord
with
general
accepted
accounting
practice
or
with
what
other
governmental
agencies
required?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
thought
they
wouldn't
have
said
without
testimony.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
smith,
one
thing
that
makes
me
keep
coming
back
and
taking
your
time
is,
that
you
refer
to
testimony
and
of
course
that's
filed.
but
i
started
over
with
the
point
and
i
finally
found
the
sentence
in
the
tax
court's
opinion,
that
says
this
is
on
page
8-19
of
the
petition
of
certiorari,
five
lines
from
the
bottom,
it
says
â€œa
write
down
of
inventory
for
excessive
stock
in
this
case
was
not
merely
desirable
for
accounting
purposes,
it
was
required
in
order
to
produce
a
certified
balance
sheet.
now
i
would
say,
i
don't
think
that
decides
a
case.
i
am
just
trying
to
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
am
trying
to
make
clear
that
this
taxpayer
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
required?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
tax
court
said
it
was
required
[attempt
to
laughter]
not
just
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
follow
up
on
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
a
point
with
which
i
do
not
necessarily
disagree.
do
you
perceive
that
there
is
any
sort
of
a
presumption
in
favor
of
what
a
taxpayer
does
when
it
is
in
accord
with
general
accepted
accounting
practice
and
moreover
his
balance
sheet
will
be
certified
unless
he
does
what
was
done.
is
there
any
sort
of
presumption
that
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
can
put
the
burden
on
a
commissioner
to
demonstrate
why
the
taxpayer
was
wrong?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
in
view
of
the
conjunctive
language
in
471?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course
one
starts
with
the
statutory
language
and
the
regulations
can
rise
no
higher
than
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
my
question
really
was
whether
or
not
statue
itself
does
not
put
the
burden
on
the
commissioner
in
this
type
of
situation
where
the
taxpayer
has
met
the
first
requirement
of
the
statue?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
am
familiar
with
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question
and
then
i
will
be
very
quiet.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
does
a
taxpayer
in
a
business
that
involves
a
substantial
number
of
items
comply
with
what
i
understand
your
point
is
and
that
is
that
there
must
be
a
realization
of
the
loss
estimated
to
exist
in
inventory
before
it
maybe
taken
in
the
taxable
year
in
question.
how
does
one
comply,
you
have
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
you
have
a
millions
bits
and
pieces
of
inventory,
you
can't
selectively
scrap,
perhaps
you
could,
but
you
would
still
have
a
very
large
number
of
items
that
perhaps
properly
should
be
written
down
on
a
cost
or
market
inventory
basis.
what
does
one
do?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
you
indicated
he
might
have
used
this
method
on
page
86?
