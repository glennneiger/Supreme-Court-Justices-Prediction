mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
government
view
there
is
a
fundamental
issue
at
stake
in
this
case
which
is
familiar
to
all
of
us,
i
think
in
computing
our
tax
liability
and
that
is
that
a
deductible
loss
can
only
be
established
by
a
closed
and
completed
transaction
fixed
by
identifiable
events
and
not
by
fluctuations
in
value.
we
all
know
this
to
be
the
case.
we
buy
share
of
stock
or
house
that
goes
up
in
value
or
down
in
value.
those
paper
loses,
so
to
speak,
are
irrelevant
in
computing
our
current
tax
liability,
and
only
when
we
sell
or
exchange
or
otherwise
dispose
off
the
asset
does
the
loss
become
fixed.
well
this
case
involves
inventories
somewhat
technical
in
nature,
the
same
principle
applies,
because
inventories
really
are
simply
a
device
of
computing
the
cost
of
goods
sold
that
is
basis
and
thereby
measuring
a
given
year's
income
within
the
annual
accounting
system
which
is
central
to
our
tax
system.
the
court
recognized
this
much
in
the
catto
decision,
in
volume
384
u.s.,
where
it
said,
the
general
and
long-standing
rule
for
all
taxpayers,
whether
they
used
the
cash
or
accrual
method
of
accounting,
is
that
costs
incurred
in
the
acquisition
of
inventory
may
not
be
currently
deducted,
but
must
be
deferred
until
the
year
of
sale,
when
the
accumulated
costs
may
be
set
off
against
the
proceeds
of
sale.
in
that
particular
case
a
portion
of
the
regulations
at
issue
here
were
under
scrutiny,
that
is
1.471-6
as
they
applied
to
livestock
raisers.
here,
we
are
principally
concerned
with
-2
and
-4
of
1.71
and
i
think
that
with
the
court's
indulgence,
the
best
way
to
explain
the
commissioner's
position
is
to
look
at
the
details
of
these
regulations
because
these
regulations
have
been
around
since
1922.
they
were
promulgated
pursuant
to
an
express
statutory
command
of
section
471,
which
is
essentially
the
same
now
as
it
was
back
in
the
revenue
act
of
1918,
and
they
are
essentially
the
same.
if
you
read
the
old
cases
and
you
look
at
the
footnotes,
article
1582
is
virtually
the
same
as
these
regulations
set
out
in
our
appendix.
now
the
new
management
of
thor
power
came
in
in
1964
and
made
three
large
scale
reductions
to
its
closing
1964
inventory,
and
by
doing
that,
it
increased
its
cost
of
goods
sold
and
thereby
decreased
its
taxable
income.
there
was
a
$2,750,000
write-down
of
closing
inventory
to
reflect
items
that
were
scrapped
as
obsolete.
there
was
also
a
$245,000
write-down
to
reflect
some
spare
parts
stock
of
unsuccessful
products,
and
shortly
thereafter,
these
parts
were
sold
at
reduced
prices.
the
commissioner
did
not
question
these
two
write-downs
and
they
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
why
because
in
our
view,
there
was
an
identifiable
event
that
established
a
closed
and
completed
transaction,
that
is
the
scrapping
or
the
reduction
of
the
price
of
the
spare
parts.
now
here,
we
have
a
$926,000
write-down
which
is
essentially
an
amalgam
of
three
other
write-downs,
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
into
the
nature
of
those
three
other
write-downs.
we
essentially
have
$926,000
deduction
which
in
our
view
is
qualitatively
different
from
those
other
two
write-downs.
why?
this
write-down
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
taxpayer
had
estimates
that
this
inventory
was
in
excess
of
a
year's
demand
of
its
customers.
now
i
think
the
important
thing
to
point
out
at
the
very
beginning
is
why
this
was
the
case.
this
taxpayer
like
all
manufacturers,
manufactured
machinery,
and
had
a
stock
of
spare
parts.
now
economically,
it
doesn't
make
sense
and
the
counsel,
i
think,
agreed
and
the
testimonies
to
this
effect
as
well,
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
manufacture
a
machine
and
then
destroy
the
dyes
or
the
tools
and
then
when
your
customers
who
have
this
machine
needs
spare
parts
five
years
down
the
road
to
retool
for
those
spare
parts,
so
all
the
spare
parts
are
made
at
once,
and
they
are
made
pursuant
to
some
estimate
of
what
you
think
how
long
machine
will
be
in
circulation.
now
this
is
described
as
excess
inventory,
but
i
want
to
stress
the
fact
it's
not
excess
in
the
sense
of
farmer
having
a
warehouse
of
oranges
that
are
going
to
rot,
or
it's
kind
of
glut
on
the
market,
it's
a
storehouse
of
goods
which
is
in
a
excess
of
what
you
think
you
can
sale
for
one
year.
that
doesn't
mean
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely
your
honor,
i
think
this
was
a
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
asolutely
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
think
it
was
perfectly
reasonable
business
sense,
and
i
think
it
goes
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
stevens
explored
with
counsel
earlier,
and
that
is,
this
was
not
an
abnormal
situation.
this
was
quite
a
normal
situation
and
in
fact
on
page
51
of
our
brief,
we
quote
the
testimony
of
thor's
president
who
conceded
that,
“any
business
which
is
involved
in
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
products
inevitably
must
have
access
inventory.”
so
i
think
that
we
don't
dispute
that
fact.
point
i
simply
want
to
make
is
that
this
was
not
a
glut
of
goods
that
had
no
utility.
it
was
simply
a
stock
of
goods
that
was
in
excess
of
the
year's
demand.
so
what
did
the
taxpayer
do?
he
said
well,
okay
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
might
turn
out
to
be
excess
at
one
point,
and
that's
basically
our
point,
because
at
some
point
is
not
at
the
end
of
1964.
the
tax
system
works
on
an
annual
accounting
system.
at
the
end
of
1964,
these
things
were
simply
estimates
and
the
commissioner's
regulations
which
i
would
like
to
now
turn
to,
do
not
provide,
in
fact
they
explicitly
prohibit
the
reduction
of
inventories
based
on
these
kind
of
estimates.
if
there
is
one
principle
that
underlines
all
of
these
regulations
and
has
done
so
for
6o
years,
is
that
inventory
adjustments
must
turn
on
objectively
verifiable
date
and
not
estimates.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
exactly,
exactly.
they
alternatively
argued
that
the
regulations
are
silent
and
somehow
they
should
be
allowed
to
sneak
through
so
to
speak,
but
we
say
no.
in
fact
the
regulations
in
our
view
explicitly
prohibit
these
write
downs
1.471-2
(f)
1,
2
and
3,
if
i
may
burden
the
court
with
all
these
number.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely,
i
believe
so.
isn't
that
the
case?
yes,
yes,
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
benefit
of
--
in
fact
there
is
a
good
deal
with
acquisitions
in
the
petitioners'
brief
about
post
--
appellate
counsel's
post
talk
justifications
but
while
that
maybe
complementary,
i
may
view
that
as
personally
complimentary,
i
think
basically
all
of
these
considerations
were
put
to
the
court
of
appeals
including
the
change
of
accounting
method
argument
as
well.
anyway,
with
that
in
mind
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
regulations
because
i
think
that
they
justify,
they
not
only
justify
they
differentiated
treatment
by
the
commissioner
of
these
three
write
downs,
but
they
required
and
they
had
required
it
since
1922.
now
the
taxpayer's
argument
pretty
much
principally
rests
on
the
notion
that
there
accountants
told
them
that
this
was
an
acceptable
accounting
practice.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
i'm
going
to
explain
them.
i
am
not
just
going
to
leave
that
statement
hanging
unsupported.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
may
well
be
at
the
sec
might
require.
in
fact
it
may
well
be
that
all
sorts
of
bodies
or
statutes
may
require
such
things
and
that
the
account
--
well
i
mean,
our
basic
point
is
that
accountants
are
concerned
with
projecting
data
to
a
reader
in
a
way
that
doesn't
really
take
into
account
measuring
taxable
income.
i
think
a
prospective
investor
might
want
to
know
that
thor
power
tool
had
a
feeling
that
it
wasn't
going
to
be
able
to
sell
all
these
things.
down
the
road
at
some
point
it
may
have
to
get
rid
off
them
and
it
maybe
worthless
and
that
may
affect
his
decision
to
buy
a
bond
or
share
of
stock
or
whatever.
but
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
was
interested
in
measuring
taxable
income,
and
i
feel
that's
quite
a
different
matter.
and
the
fact
that
there
might
be
such
other
requirements
by
the
accountants
or
by
other
governmental
agencies,
i
think
is
quite
beside
the
point
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that.
although,
i
think
to
fill
out
the
story,
the
chronology
is
important
as
well.
i
mean,
this
wasn't
the
situation
where
the
accountants
came
in,
and
insisted
on
this
method.
it
was
sort
of
quite
the
opposite
management.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
there
was
testimony
to
that
effect.
but
all
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
management
made
the
write-down
and
then
asked
the
accountants
for
an
opinion
as
to
it's
validity,
and
in
fact
the
record
indicates
and
we
sort
of
quoted
in
our
briefs,
the
accountant's
opinion
was
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
page
8,
i
mean
it's
a
standard
--
it
was
a
standard
caveat
that
the
accountants
kept
appending
to
their
opinions.
it
said
“while
the
inventories
reserves
provided
the
best
the
current
judgment
of
the
company's
management,
it
it's
not
possible
to
evaluate
these
reserves
applied
to
ultimate
disposition
of
the
inventories
involved.”
in
other
words
--
i
mean
i
think
it's
conceded
this
is
an
estimate
and
our
point
simply
is
while
that
maybe
a
perfectly
reasonable
thing
for
an
accountant
to
do,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
regulations
specifically
prohibit
those
kind
of
estimates.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
the
tax
court
did
find
that
they
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it's
in
conformity
with
one
requirement
of
section
446.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
mr.
justice
white,
if
i
may
just
answer
your
question
in
a
slightly
different
way.
i
don't
think
there
is
a
choice
here
that
you
have
to
say,
are
we
going
to
--
which
requirement
has
to
--
there
are
two
requirements.
there
is
a
requirement
that
it
conformed
to
the
best
accounting
practice,
there
is
also
a
requirement
that
it
clearly
reflects
income.
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
here
that
this
was
an
accepted
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
tax
court
did
not
find
it.
i
think
the
tax
court
found
that
it
clearly
reflected
financial
income.
i
think,
that
what
counsel
has
said
here
this
morning,
but
we're
talking
about
whether
it
clearly
reflected
taxable
income
and
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
necessarily
has
to
be
made
by
reference
to
the
commissioner's
detailed
regulations.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
may
not
be,may
not
be.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
then
i
must
say
i
can
--
i
think
it's
true
as
mr.
justice
stevens
indicated,
there
is
no
one
--
i
don't
think
in
this
area
there
is
one
accounting
method
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
right,
there
was
testimony
to
that
effect.
but
the
point
is,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly
i
think
if
there
was
a
disclosure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
is
no
such
finding
in
that
regard.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
think
the
testimony
simply
said
that
the
taxpayer's
method
would
be
a
good
method
of
accounting.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yeah,
i
think
the
way
–
perhaps
the
resolve
this
in
a
procedural
sort
of
way,
i
mean
it
never
quite
frankly
occurred
to
me,
but
if
the
statute
requires
these
two
things
and
the
taxpayers
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
tax
court,
and
it's
the
taxpayer's
job
to
demonstrate
that,
its
claimed
reduction
is
proper
and
if
it
doesn't
meet
both
tests
then
the
deficiency
is
approved.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
don't
want
to
confront
the
accounting
testimony.
i
don't
think
i
have
to.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
don't
think
i
have
to
do
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
you
are
right.
i
think
it's
right
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
this
method
of
accounting
was
perfectly
--
the
tax
court
goes
on
to
say
–-
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
what?
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
then
the
tax
court
went
on
to
say
mr.
justice
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes
exactly.
the
tax
court
went
on
to
say,
if
you
turn
to
page
over
--
“however
the
petition
also
showed
that
the
method
clearly
reflects
taxable
income,”
and
our
point
is
that
he
hasn't
done
that
and
the
reason
he
hasn't
done
that,
he
hasn't
conformed
with
the
regulations.
i
think
although
the
counsels
deny
that
he
(inaudible)
the
regulations,
he
really
does
because
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
then
the
secretary
makes
the
computation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
that's
what
we
have
done.
yeah,
but
i
think,
i
think
you
have
to
get
to
the
regulations
only
to
determine
whether
it
clearly
reflects
income
because
the
regulations
i
think
provide
a
detail
panoply
of
rules
as
to
what
will
meet
the
clearly
reflect
income
standard.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's
absolutely
the
case
and
the
reason
we
win
in
our
view
is
because
this
doesn't
meet
the
requirements
of
the
regulations
yes.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
i
don't
think
there
is
any
presumption
as
such.
i
would
not
characterize
it
as
presumption,
i
would
simply
say
it
needs
that
one
way
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh
no
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
commissioner
--i
think
the
taxpayer
has
a
--
these
are
statutes
in
which
the
courts
have
traditionally
characterized
the
taxpayer's
burden
as
heavy
one
and
the
commissioner's
discretion
is
a
broader
one.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
i
think
that's
right
and
i
think
to
follow
up
on
your
point
i
think
the
taxpayer,
and
to
get
into
the
regulations,
the
taxpayer
has
plucked
out
a
sentence
out
of
the
regulations
which
says
here
that
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
am
in
471-2
(b).
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
page
85,
i
am
sorry,
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
inventory
rules
should
give
effect
to
trade
customs
which
come
within
the
scope
of
the
best
accounting
practice
and
then
down
below
it
says
an
inventory
that
can
be
use
under
the
best
accounting
practice
in
a
balance
sheet
showing
the
financial
position
of
the
taxpayer
can
as
a
general
rule
be
regarded
as
clearly
reflecting
income.
i
think
that's
what
the
regulations
provide,
but
i
think
that's
it.
what
that
sentence
--
the
taxpayer
would
have
that
sentence
stand
as
a
kind
of
universal
standard
in
derogation
of
the
rest
of
these
detailed
rules
that
have
existed
for
almost
60
years.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
don't
think
it
does
mr.
justice
powell.
in
fact
the
portions
of
the
code
in
which
the
--
i
mean
the
general
rule
is
that
the
taxpayer
has
the
burden
of
proof
of
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
and
i
think
that
the
portions
of
the
code
has
a
few
sections
which
specifically
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
commissioner
in
accumulated
earnings
tax
case
if
the
taxpayer
files
a
statement
of
reasonable
cause
for
accumulations
then
the
commissioner
has
the
burden
that's
by
statue,
in
a
case
where
the
commissioner
asserts
the
50%
fraud
penalty,
the
commissioner
has
the
burden.
the
tax
court
rules
provide
that
when
the
commissioner
raises
new
matter
by
answer
it
has
the
burden.
i
think
that
those
are
unusual
circumstances
and
i
think
that
the
general
rule
has
to
apply
here.
simply
qualifying
under
one
provision,
under
one
requirement
of
the
statue
i
don't
think
shifts,
you
know,
provides
any
shifting
of
burdens
of
proof.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
there
are
several
ways.
in
fact
counsel
adverted
to
one
of
them,
scraping
of
goods
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
what
one
does
is
look
at
the
regulations
which
provide
for
a
way
of
fixing
the
proper
amount
of
the
write
down.
the
regulations
provide
--
let
me
give
two
examples.
if
you
look
at
page
85-86,
there
is
a
provision
for
a
write
down
for
damaged
or
imperfect
goods,
goods
that
have
been
shopworn
etcetera,
and
the
regulations
provide
that
they
should
be
valued
at
bona
fide
selling
prices
less
direct
cost
of
disposition
whether
you
are
on
the
cost
or
lower
cost
to
the
market
method.
and
the
regulations
go
on
to
say
little
further
down,
i
suppose
two-thirds
the
way
down
on
page
86,
“bona
fide
selling
price
means
actual
offering
of
goods
during
a
period
ending
not
later
than
30
days
after
inventory
day.”
and
if
i
may
drop
down
a
few
more,
“actually
the
burden
of
proof
will
rest
upon
the
taxpayer
to
show
that
such
exceptional
goods
as
are
valued
upon
such
selling
prices
come
within
the
classification
above
and
he
shall
maintain
such
records
of
the
disposition
of
his
goods,
as
will
enable
a
verification.”
the
regulations,
the
hallmark
of
the
regulations,the
touchstone,
is
independent
means
of
verification.
now
going
on
to
page
87,
if
i
may,
the
lower
of
cost
or
market
and
this
sort
of
in
a
way
i
would
like
the
clear
up
what
i
think
is
a
fundamental
sort
of
misconception
advanced
by
the
counsel
and
that
is,
that
somehow
market
means
net
realizable
value.
market
and
the
lower
cost
of
market
doesn't
mean
net
realizable
value,
it
means
replacement
value.
and
the
reason
it
means
replacement
value
simply
is
because
as
i
said
earlier
the
whole
process
of
inventories
is
to
determine
basis.
in
another
words,
if
you
buys
something
for
$100
and
then
two
years
down
the
road
you
find
out
that
you
can
buy
it
for
$50,
well
if
the
commissioner
will
then
say
if
you
are
on
the
lower
of
cost
or
market
then
if
you
went
out
and
bought
one
today
you
would
only
pay
$50
for
it,
we
will
allow
you
a
$50
write
down.
but
again
it
has
to
be
on
the
basis
of
independent
verifiable
data.
if
i
may
ask
the
court
to
look
at
one
more
of
these
detailed
provisions
on
page
88
sub
paragraph
c
on
the
lower
of
cost
or
market
it
says
“where
the
inventory
is
valued
on
the
basis
of
cost
or
market
whichever
is
lower,
the
market
value
of
each
article
on
hand
that
the
inventory
date
shall
be
compared.”
in
another
words,
the
commissioner's
regulation
–
i
mean
i
think
it's
--
i
don't
think
that
it's
incomprehensible
to
infer
that
there
is
tremendous
amount
of
abuse
in
the
keeping
of
inventories
and
the
way
the
commissioner
has
tried
to
set
up
these
requirements
for
almost
60
years
is
to
provide
for
independent
verifiable
evidence
of
inventory
reduction.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh
it
has
to
be
scrapped.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
another
words,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
are
another
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
if
i
may
just
modify
your
example
in
one
respect.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
(attempt
to
laughter)well,
i
would
say
that
the
write
down
would
be
permitted
if
the
goods
were
damaged
in
perfect
shopworn,
unstylish
or
they
are
broken,
lost
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
exactly
and
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
excuse
me.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
said
if
the
goods
were
damaged
or
shopworn,
it
said,
in
other
words
what
i
am
simply
saying
that
these
are
detailed
technical
rules.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
certainly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
page
87.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
well
no.
let's
put
it
--
no,
86
is
not
irrelevant,
86
simply
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
refutes
--
i
mean
it's
relevant
only
because
petitioner
has
claimed
to
come
within
it.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
prohibition
is
at
the
top
of
page
87,
paragraphs
1,
2
and
3
“deducting
from
the
inventory
a
reserve
for
price
changes
or
an
estimated
depreciation
in
the
value
thereof,”
and
we
set
forth
in
great
detail
in
our
brief
at
pages
41
to
44
and
cited
a
number
of
cases
which
incidentally
antedate.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
two
and
three
as
well
expressly
prohibit.
we
think
that
what
the
taxpayer
did
here
on
the
basis
of
estimates
is
describe
by
each
of
those
sub
paragraphs.
he
deducted
from
the
inventory
reserve
for
price
changes
or
an
estimated
depreciation,
in
other
words
that
these
were
estimates
and
not
independently
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
there
is
no
expressed
prohibition,
everything
else
--
we
have
invoked
the
regulation
in
every
other
respect
to
refute
the
taxpayer's
claim
to
the
inventory
right
then.
in
fact
because
the
taxpayer's
principle
claim
is
that
somehow
this
is
lower
of
cost
or
market
and
we
say
simply
it
is
misread
market.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
say
that
excuse
me.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
were
were
two,
as
i
said
earlier,
there
were
two
specific
write
downs,
one
of
them
for
obsolete
goods,
you
are
right
and
the
other
one
was
for
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
they
were
scrapped,
they
were
scrapped
as
obsolete.
in
other
words,
they
met
the
scrapping
requirement,
the
one
that
the
taxpayer
feels
so
unhappy
about.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
and
i
would
suggest
that
wouldn't
meet
the
test
of
the
regulations
simply
because
something
wasn't
sold
for
a
year,
i
don't
think
indicates
that
it's
without
utility
or
value
to
the
taxpayer.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
permitted?
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
as
such
that
permits
a
write
down
for
obsolescence
or
scrapped
as
obsolescence,
but
that
it
seems
to
us
that
the
statutory
basis
for
that
is
section
165
of
the
code
which
simply
permits
a
loss
when
something
becomes
valueless
like
when
you
had
a
casualty
and
your
house
burns
down.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yeah
exactly,
and
it
is
of
no
value
to
you
or
whatever
you
can
get
for
it.
i
think
my
time
has
expired,
if
you
have
no
further
questions.
