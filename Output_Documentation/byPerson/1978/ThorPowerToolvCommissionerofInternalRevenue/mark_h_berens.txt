mr.
mark
h.
berens
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
two
issues
under
the
internal
revenue
code;
the
valuation
of
excess
inventory
and
the
calculation
of
bad
debts
by
the
reserve
method
formula.
both
issues
which
are
separate
seem
to
be
of
high
frequency
and
inspire
considerable
amount
of
feeling
among
the
taxpayers
involved.
the
principle
one
involves
the
valuation
of
excess
inventory.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
they
certainly
do
mr.
chief
justice.
the
excess
inventory
issue
is
really
a
question
of
timing.
when
may
inventory
that
a
taxpayer
reasonably
determines
to
be
in
excess
of
foreseeable
demand,
when
may
it
be
written
down?
at
the
time
he
makes
his
determination
or
later
when
it
is
eventually
scrapped
as
the
commissioner
contends.
the
importance
of
this
issue
is
indicated
by
the
filing
of
very
thoughtful
amicus
briefs
by
the
united
states
chamber
of
commerce
and
the
national
association
of
manufacturers.
the
issue
effects
all
manufacturers
on
the
lower
of
cost
or
market
method
as
well
as
wholesalers
and
dealers
who
stock
replacement
parts.
this
includes
the
automotive
industry,
farm
equipment,
machinery,
electronics,
electrical
equipment
of
all
sorts
and
good
sound
business
sense
requires
these
manufacturers
and
dealers
to
stock
or
really
overstock
spare
parts
if
they
have
to
serve
their
customers.
when
the
parts
are
first
produced
it
is
very
difficult
and
sometimes
impossible
to
predict
exactly
how
much
demand
for
a
part
based
on
its
wearing
ability,
breakage
etcetera
and
so
they
are
intentionally
overproduced
by
most
manufacturers.
after
the
part
has
been
in
use
after
its
main
product
has
been
in
use
for
a
while,
it
becomes
evident
that
the
part
is
overstocked
and
at
this
time
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
require
that
the
excess
part,
the
excess
quantity
be
marked
down
to
a
net
realizable
value.
and
it
is
this
requirement
to
clearly
reflect
financial
accounting
income
that
we
submit
should
be
parallelly
determinative
of
taxable
income.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
in
the
meantime
did
you
say?
mr.
mark
h.
berens
the
excess
parts
in
issue
mr.
justice
blackmun
for
64%
or
78%
were
disposed
off
by
1971.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
by
scraping
and
this
was
by
an
exact
tracing,
exhibit
17,
i
believe
shows
that.
i
am
going
to
dwell
a
little
bit
on
the
facts
here,
perhaps
a
little
more
than
i
should
to
get
the
proper
perspective
because
while
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute,
the
parties
interpret
them
quite
differently.
at
the
end
of
1964,
thor's
new
management
determined
that
it's
inventory
was
greatly
overvalued.
after
making
a
number
of
specific
write
downs
it
was
confronted
with
the
fact
that
it
had
44,000
different
items
of
inventory
which
comprised
millions
of
pieces.
most
of
these,
33000
different
items
were
replacement
parts
and
accessories,
and
they
were
held
for
the
most
part
in
quantities
greatly
exceeding
foreseeable
demand.
it
was
impractical
to
value
these
individually,
and
so
management
developed
two
procedures,
statistically
sound,
fairly
commonplace
among
manufacturers
at
the
time
to
write
down
or
determine
how
much
should
be
written
down.
the
primary
procedure
was
to
compare
an
item
by
item
basis,
the
quantities
on
hand
with
the
actual
sales
thor
had
made
during
1964
or
the
production
usage
of
the
parts,
and
i
stress
item
by
item.
if
there
were
no
sales
or
use
of
that
item
they
were
written
off
as
obsolete,
a
write
off
that
the
commissioner
accepted.
if
there
were
some
usage,
but
the
amount
at
hand
exceeded
two
years
usage,
then
that
portion
in
excess
of
two
years
was
written
off.
amounts
between
one
and
two
years
were
partially
written
off.
at
some
locations
of
thor
there
was
inadequate
data
on
usage
for
the
preceding
year
and
so
additional,
not
substitute,
but
additional
percentage
write
downs
were
done
for
a
limited
number
of
limited
categories
of
goods.
thor's
president
testified
that
the
write
downs
were
solely
intended
to
accurately
reflect
current
inventory
value
at
the
end
of
1964.
he
stated
that
income
tax
effects
were
not
even
considered
at
that
time.
the
tax
court,
based
on
his
testimony
and
that
of
several
accounting
experts
found
three
specific
things;
that
thor's
procedures
for
writing
down
the
inventory
and
i
am
quoting,
“the
inventory
in
issue
--
wrote
down
the
inventory
in
issue
to
its
estimate
of
current
net
realizable
value,”
and
i
stress
current
net
realizable
value.
the
court
also
found
that
this
was
required
by
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
and
it
further
found
that
this
constituted
a
best
accounting
practice
within
the
meaning
of
section
471
of
the
code
to
which
i
will
return.
the
findings
of
the
court
which
were
not
disputed
by
the
court
of
appeals
nor
by
the
commissioner,
were
fully
supported
by
the
testimony
of
six
expert
accountants,
five
of
whom
were
preeminent
in
the
field
of
accountancy.
they
testified
that
general
accepted
accounting
principles
require
the
excess
inventory
to
be
written
down
to
clearly
reflect
financial
income.
they
stated
that
the
use
of
a
formula
of
this
sort
was
essential
as
a
practical
matter
and
that
it
was
commonplace.
they
specifically
testified
that
both
procedures,
that
is
the
formula
and
the
supplementary
percentage
write
downs
conformed
to
generally
accepted
accounting
principles.
they
testified
that
the
write
down
was
reasonable
in
amount
and
this
was
based
on
a
hindsight
basis
including
the
degree
of
scraping
and
finally
they
testified
that
they
would
have
withheld
certification
at
the
end
of
1964
had
thor
not
written
down
the
inventory
as
it
had.
they
further
testified
that
if
thor
had
not
written
it
down,
but
had
waited
until
it
was
scrapped
to
write
it
down,
financial
income
would
have
been
distorted
both
in
1964
and
in
the
later
year
or
years
when
it
was
scrapped.
i
want
to
stress,
that
the
testimony
and
the
findings
of
the
court
stated
that
this
was
an
estimated
current
loss
in
existence
at
the
end
of
1964.
it
was
not
a
provision
for
a
future
loss.
now
throughout
respondent's
brief,
the
write
down
is
characterized
as
an
anticipation
of
or
a
reserve
for
a
future
loss,
this
we
submit
is
contrary
to
the
record.
thor's
write
down
is
authorized,
we
submit,
by
two
sections
of
the
court;
section
446
which
basically
provides
that
taxable
income
shall
be
computed
under
the
method
of
accounting
the
taxpayer
uses
in
keeping
his
books,
provided
it
clearly
reflects
income,
but
more
directly
governing
is
section
471
which
is
the
key
section
on
inventory
accounting.
it
imposes
two
conjunctive
requirements,
binding
on
both
the
taxpayer
and
the
commissioner
that
inventory
accounting
must
confirm
first
as
nearly
as
maybe
to
the
best
accounting
practice
in
the
trade
or
business
and
secondly
as
most
clearly
reflecting
the
income.
now
the
tax
court
found
that
thor
met
the
first
requirement,
conformance
to
the
best
accounting
practice.
the
testimony
of
the
experts
which
said
that
if
thor
had
waited
to
scrap
it,
it
would
not
have
confirmed
to
a
best
accounting
practice,
means
that
the
commissioner's
scrapping
method
cannot
meet
the
first
requirement
of
section
471.
it
cannot
be
a
best
accounting
practice.
this
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
no,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
i
am
quite
aware
of
that
from
the
(inaudible)
decision
that
there
maybe
more
than
one
best
accounting
practice.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes.
the
statute
actually
says
'the',
but
i
think
it
is
normally
read
as
meaning
'a'
and
i
sometimes
use
them
interchangeably,
but
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
the
question
then
resolves
did
thor's
method
clearly
reflect
income,
under
both
section
446
and
471?
and
we
believe
the
test
under
both
is
identical.
perhaps
the
best
way
of
getting
at
that
troublesome
question
is
to
relate
the
two
methods
to
each
other,
and
it
seems
a
fair
way
of
approaching
it,
because
there
seems
to
be
no
there
logical
point
of
time
when
the
write
down
could
occur
than
one
of
the
other
of
these,
the
one
side
when
the
taxpayer
reasonably
determines
it
should
be
written
down
or
later
when
it's
scraped.
i
cannot
think
of
any
other
point
of
time
that
it
could
be
used
as
a
test.
now,
from
this
viewpoint,
perhaps
the
best
way
of
approaching
is
to
look
at
the
commissioner's
scrapping
method.
does
it
clearly
reflect
income?
now,
from
a
financial
accounting
viewpoint
it
doesn't,
as
was
established,
but
beyond
that,
the
commissioner
basically
contends
that
to
clearly
reflect
income
you
should
overstate
your
inventory
by
not
writing
unsalable
goods
down
to
their
net
realizable
value,
and
that
you
should
hold
this
overstatement
in
the
inventory
for
a
year
or
two
or
more
until
whenever
you
eventually
scrap
it.
now
the
layman
would
not
view
an
overstatement
of
inventory
to
clearly
reflect
income,
because
the
higher
the
inventory
you
stated,
the
higher
the
income
is
reported.
the
commissioner's
view
makes
an
assumption
here,
not
only
that
it
was
a
future
loss
but
tied
in
that,
and
it's
in
both
the
lower
court's
opinions
and
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent,
is
that
inventory
losses
do
not
occur
until
they
are
realized.
now,
we
submit
and
i
use
a
strong
word
that
this
is
a
radical
argument,
it
is
never
to
our
research
been
advanced
in
some
60
years.
the
administrative
history
outlined
at
length
in
our
reply
brief
is
completely
to
the
contrary,
starting
with
tbr
48
issued
in
around
1919.
there
are
no
cases
that
hold
realization
of
losses
of
inventory
are
required
for,
and
i
should
emphasize
for
a
taxpayer
using
the
lower
of
cost
or
market
method
for
a
cost
taxpayer
that
is
a
different
question.
and
in
particular,
i
cite
the
discussion
in
space
controls
322
f.2d
147
and
148
which
outlines
the
history
of
the
realization
issue
in
inventory
accounting.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
no
in
the
thor's
case
it
was
specifically
an
estimate
of
scrap
value.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
because
on
an
individual
item
basis
mr.
justice
white
it
is
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
--
it
is
unknown,
it
is
clear
that
thor
may
have
underestimated
one
of
the
44,000
items
and
overestimated
the
other.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
in
1971,
when
arthur
anderson
was
first
engaged
as
thor's
accountants,
this
from
the
record,
they
did
a
first-time-through
special
test
of
the
inventory
write
downs
of
this
excess
system,
and
they
found,
for
the
--
using
the
exact
system
and
that
the
company
used
and
doing
very
extensive
sampling,
they
found
in
1970
that
the
write
down
--
i
am
not
speaking
of
the
1964
but
in
1970
it
was
about,
if
i
recall
it
correctly,
about
5%
too
low,
and
in
1971
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
they
should
have
written
off
more
than
they
did.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
the
write
down
was
too
little,
a
low
is
misleading
there,
too
little
and
again
in
1971
it
was
too
little
by
a
larger
degree.
in
other
words,
thor's
formula
was
on
the
conservative
side.
the
testimony
of
mr.
beldock
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
absolutely,
absolutely
and
at
that
time
to
the
extent
that
it
was
sold,
that
it
already
have
been
written
taxable
income
in
the
later
year
would
have
been
increased.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes,
yes.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
no
they
are
not
segregated
and
i
volunteer
the
observation
that
while
it
was
stated
in
both
lower
courts'
opinions
neither
state
--
neither
cited
any
authority
for
segregation
and
we
could
find
none.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
is
done.
let
me
stress
that
this
is
a
statistical
system
for
which
--
for
any
particular
item
may
not
work.
in
fact
i
will
go
as
far
as
to
say
it's
unlikely
to
be
accurate
and
that's
the
very
need
for
it
because
it
can't
be
accurate
for
one
item.
it
is
accurate
because
there
is
44,000
items.
as
all
of
the
experts
testified,
a
formula
system
like
this
is
statistically
sound,
if
it's
properly
conceived,
and
while
every
item
could
be
wrong,
in
the
aggregate
it
is
right.
and
i
would
like
to
analogize
here
to
the
retail
sales
method
where
the
same
problem
exists
for
a
department
store,
where
there
are
sometimes
hundreds
of
thousands
of
items
priced
at
retail
value
and
when
they
take
inventory,
they
use
average
mark-up
formulas
in
reverse
to
mark
them
down
to
cost.
this
is
exactly
the
same
statistical
system,
and
i
should
interrupt
myself
to
say
that,
that
is
specifically
approved
by
the
retail
sales
method
regulations
that
this
is
the
same
statistical
premises
upon
which
the
write
down
by
thor
is
based.
now
i
also
stress
that
even
on
an
overall
statistical
basis,
it
is
not
accurate.
we
do
not
contend
it
is
perfectly
accurate,
but
i
harken
to
the
cohan
rule
promulgated
by
judge
leonard
hand
in
1930
where
he
said,
most
important
things
can't
be
exactly
accurate
and
that
the
tax
law
has
to
be
practical
and
as
long
as
it
is
reasonably
accurate,
this
is
all
that
the
law
requires.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
it's
going
to
be
adjusted
on
a
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
or
when
it's
eventually
all
sold.
say
that
you
completely
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
then
that's
suggested
too,
the
scraping
revenues
go
into
gross
income.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
then
you
--
through
the
write
off
system
you
get
an
additional
loss
at
that
time.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
it
rolls
through,
but
i
would
like
to
stress
mr.
justice
white,
both
when
it's
scraped
and
when
it
is
sold,
either
disposal
eventually
catches
up.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
suppose
it
would
be
--
would
you
prefer
mr.
justice
blackmun
to
give
it
now,
i
was
going
to
save
it
for
a
rebuttal
time
but
i
would
be
glad
to
respond.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
may
be
i
better
in
case
i
lose
my
rebuttal
time.
we
submit
that
this
is,
and
again
i
use
a
strong
term
a
'non
issue'
in
reality.
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
commissioner
had
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
we
do
not
believe
met
that
burden.
there
are
three
requirements
for
a
change
of
accounting
method
within
the
meaning
of
446(e)
of
the
code,
and
the
principal
one
is
that,
income
escapes
tax
because
of
the
change
or
that
there
is
double
deduction
or
in
this
case
a
double
increase
in
cost
of
goods
sold
and
either
actually
or
potentially.
and
as
we
explain
it
at
length
in
our
reply
brief
there
is
no
possibility
by
thor's
procedures
that
any
income
could
have
escaped
or
a
double
reduction.
we
secondly
point
out
that
change
of
method
is
a
specific
term
meaning
a
change
of
the
basis
of
valuation
which
was
the
lower
of
cost
or
market
which
was
not
changed,
or
a
change
in
a
inventory
method
such
as
from
fifo
to
lifo
or
to
change
a
cost
accounting
method
which
thor
also
did
not
change.
it
does
not
reach
down
into
the
component
techniques
of
calculation
within
the
basis
of
valuation,
and
within
the
method
used.
also
in
1964
the
regulations
made
this
clear,
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
it
was
only
the
later
amendments
of
1970
where
the
regulations
stretched,
we
believe
the
statutory
standard,
to
try
to
define
change
of
method
to
include
a
change
of
a
component
of
the
method
and
we
do
not
believe
that
as
we
said
in
our
brief
that
that
regulation
applies
to
1964
and
in
fact
we
argue
that
it
goes
beyond
the
statutory
intention.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes,
and
the
record
is
clear
on
that
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
as
we
conceive
it
based
on
generally
accepted
accounting
principles,
it
is
part
of
the
lower
of
cost
or
market
system.
it
does
not
meet
the
specific
requirements
of
or
as
interpreted
by
the
commissioner
of
the
market
regulation,
the
lower
of
cost
or
market.
i
misstated
that.
the
commissioner
argues
it
does
not
meet
the
definitions
within
the
lower
of
cost
or
market
method
of
the
regulations.
as
our
brief
points
out
we
submit
that
if
they
are
interpreted
to
fulfill
the
statutory
intent,
that
is
to
constitute
a
best
accounting
practice
that
they
do
authorize
this
type
of
write
down.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
no
mr.
justice
blackmun,
we
cannot
attack
them
because
they
are
an
omission.
they
don't
deal
explicitly
with
the
problem.
we
say
this
application,
if
they
are
interpreted
to
preclude
this
type
of
a
write
down
we
object
to
that,
but
we
do
not
say
that
any
provision
of
the
regulation
is
invalid
and
i
stress
because
it's
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes
the
commissioner's
interpretation
of
the
regulations
we
believe
is
improper,
but
the
regulations
are
not
invalid.
they
are
basically
silent
on
the
write
down
of
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
no,
the
regulation
--
you
expressed
it
in
a
different
way
mr.
justice
stevens
it
makes
it
--
i'll
have
to
answer
it
a
little
differently.
the
regulation
as
far
as
it
goes
is
not
contrary
to
the
statute.
the
regulation
we
concede
is
silent
on
the
write
down
of
excess
inventory.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
we
never
argued
that
there
was
an
extraordinary
circumstance,
that
was
from
the
tax
court's
opinion.
we
argued
and
we
argue
here
and
i
have
not
stated
this
very
well
that
if
you
--
that
the
language
of
-4
dealing
with
the
write
down
of
market
construed
broadly
where
it
says
if
normal
conditions
of
the
market
do
not
exist,
that
you
may
use
the
best
available
evidence.
we
say
that
that
covers
excess
inventory
while
at
the
same
time
conceding
that
excess
inventory
is
not
specifically
provided
for
by
name
in
that
regulation.
we
also
parallelly
argue
that
under
the
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
yes,
yes.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
we
contend
that
there
is
inherent
abnormality
in
the
market
for
replacements
parts,
that
there
is
not
a
normal
pricing
effect
of
supply
and
demand
as
was
testified
both
by
mr.
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
the
market
does
not
operate
in
the
normal
way
for
replacement
parts.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
misapplying
this
concept
in
that
point.
the
regular
goods
you
can
move
them
if
they
are
slow
moving
by
lowering
the
price.
with
replacement
parts
there
is
essentially
no
elasticity
of
demand.
you
cannot
lower
the
price
and
move
them.
so
although
you
have
produced
them
intentionally,
you
still
--
if
you
could
be
perfect
you
would
produce
exactly
the
right
amount
that's
eventually
needed,
but
you
can't
and
so
you
produce
intentionally
the
excess.
that
production
site
is
not
what
makes
it
extraordinary,
what
makes
it
--
i
don't
want
to
use
the
word
extraordinary,
what
makes
it
an
abnormal
situation
is
the
nature
of
the
goods,
the
replacement
parts.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
would
say
it
would
and
it
certainly
would
apply
to
the
retailer
who
buys
quantities
of
goods
some
of
which
he
knows
are
going
to
turn
out
to
be
obsolete
and
unsellable,
which
ones
he
doesn't
know,
but
the
lower
of
cost
or
market
system
is
designed
to
handle
that
situation.
the
two
of
the
most
important
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
area
of
tax
accounting,
the
kansas
city
structural
steel
which
condemned,
one
of
them
being
kansas
city
structural
steel,
which
condemned
the
taxpayer's
base
stock
method
because
it
misrepresented
the
facts.
it
merged
the
inventory
results
of
one
year
with
that
of
another,
and
that
method
is
designed
to
do
that.
really
that
objection
that
this
court
found
to
that
method
we
think
applies
to
the
scraping
method.
it
delays
recognizing
a
loss
that
has
occurred
to
some
year
after
it
has
really
occurred
and
in
that
sense
it
misrepresents
the
facts.
in
a
case
that
i
embarrassingly
must
admit
was
not
cited
in
our
briefs,
united
states
--
cartridge
versus
united
states,
the
decision
of
this
court
and
we
overlooked
it
until
two
days
ago,
volume
284.
there
was
--
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
think
269
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
a
ammunitions
manufacturer
at
the
end
of
world
war
i
was
terminated
by
the
government.
he--
in
1918
he
immediately
wrote
down
his
inventory
to
salvage
value
of
about
$230,000.
while
settlement
negotiations
were
going
on,
the
commissioner
contended
that
the
write
down
should
be
postponed
until
the
eventual
payments
by
the
government
became
known
which
occurred
in
1921
or
1922,
and
the
total
payments
amounted
to
$730,000,
a
difference
of
500,000.
this
court
in
an
unanimous
opinion
at
that
time
stressed,
and
the
taxpayer
was
on
the
lower
of
cost
or
market,
stressed
that
the
annual
accounting
period
applied
inventory
as
events
happened,
and
that
the
taxpayer
was
entitled
to
write
it
down
as
he
saw
the
situation
in
1918,
230,000.
even
though
there
was
a
prospect
of
later
recovery
which
indeed
occurred,
this
should
be
taken
into
income
in
the
later
year
as
it
became
a
closed
event.
i
think
mr.
justice
white
this
is
quite
parallel
to
the
line
of
questions
you
were
addressing
to
me
earlier.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
well
we
were
reading
some
of
the
cases
in
respondent's
brief
and
one
sharp
pre-commissioner
said
it
was
bound
by
us
cartridge
and
that's
the
first
time
that
it
had
crossed
apparently
anyone's
eye
in
our
office.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
i
wish
she
would
have
found
it
earlier.
i
see
my
time
is
up
and
i
have
not
even
touched
the
bad-debt
issue.
mr.
mark
h.
berens
we
will
have
to
stand
(voice
overlap)
mr.
chief
justice.
