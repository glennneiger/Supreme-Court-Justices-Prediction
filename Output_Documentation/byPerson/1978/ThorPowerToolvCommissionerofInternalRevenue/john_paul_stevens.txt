justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
you
have
twice
used
the
phrase
a
best
accounting
practice.
i
take
it
it's
understood
that
there
is
not
a
single
best
accounting
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
an
unusual
use
of
the
word
best,
but
it
really
means
an
acceptable
or
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
i
wasn't
misunderstanding
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
sorry
mister
berens
when
you
say
you
took
the
position
the
regulation
was,
or
was
not
contrary
to
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
is
1471.4
silent
on
it?
i
thought
it
allowed
the
write
down
of
excess
inventory
if
there
was
extraordinary
circumstance
that
produced
the
excess
and
i
thought
you
then
argued
about
whether
or
not
there
was
an
extraordinary
circumstance
from
the
tax
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
stay
with
that
for
just
a
moment.
i
guess
i
was
wrong
in
using
the
word
extraordinary.
it's,
where
there
abnormal
market
circumstance
or
something
like
it
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
contend
that
the
existence
of
an
excess
inventory
--
do
you
contend
there
were
abnormal
market
circumstances
in
your
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
answer
the
court
of
appeals
gave
as
i
remember
was,
you
regularly
produce
in
excess,
because
this
is
the
normal
way
you
do
business
but
that
nevertheless
is
abnormal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
your
reasoning
apply
to
any
goods
which
a
manufacturer
makes
expecting
not
to
be
able
to
sell
100%
of
his
production?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
sort
of
fundamental
question
about
your
view
on
the
statute
and
the
regulation?
they
argue
in
effect
that
there
is
an
omission
in
the
regulation.
they
have
argued
alternatively
that
they
complied
with
the
regulations
and
also
that
the
regulations
are
defective
by
not
providing
for
this
particular
problem.
is
it
your
position
that
reading
471
which
is
their
central
section,
that
where
it
says
such
taxpayer
on
such
basis
as
a
secretary
or
his
delegate
may
prescribe
so
forth
and
so
on,
that
they
must
confirm
to
a
regulation
by
the
secretary
authorizing
the
particular
procedure
they
are
using,
then
there
is
no
room
for
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
if
there
is
not
a
regulation
authorizing
it
they
are
through?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
burdened
the
court
of
appeals
with
those.
[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that
your
method;
the
method
that
you
insist
on
would
be
accepted
in
the
accounting
field
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it
isn't
then
this
statute
isn't
satisfied
either?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith
let
me
get
something
straight?
justice
john
paul
stevens
earlier
your
opponent
and
i
had
a
colloquy
in
which
we
agreed
there
could
be
more
than
one
best
accounting
method.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
the
sec,
for
sec
purposes,
they
had
required
disclosure
to
the
fact
that
the
inventory
on
the
book
should
be
somewhat
larger
than
its
real
value.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
not
unlike
a
case
where
you
might
have
a
piece
of
real
estate,
that's
on
its
book
showed
one
figure
but
there
is
a
reason
to
believe
its
market
values
is
much
lower.
i
assume
the
accountants
wouldn't
certify
unless
there
was
disclosure
of
the
fact
that
there
is
great
difference
market
value
and
the
other.
that
would
necessarily
mean
of
course
you
could
take
a
deduction
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
let
me
get
to
the
heart
of
the
thing.
is
there
however
any
finding
one
way
or
another
on
the
question
whether
accounting
in
conformity
with
the
commissioner's
regulations
would
be
or
would
not
be
a
best
method
of
accounting,
an
acceptable
method?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
testimony
by
the
experts
that
they
put
on
the
stand
that
that
would
not
be
an
acceptable
method?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
unacceptable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
a
way
i
think
your
argument
may
be
that
the
taxpayer
is
really
challenging
the
regulation
and
requiring
a
method
of
accounting
that's
not
a
best
method
of
accounting
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
even
though
it's
been
on
the
books
for
some
40
years
or
something?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
mr.
smith,
one
of
the
taxpayer
came
to
the
tax
court
or
came
to
the
commissioner
and
said,
look
my
net
realizable
value
is
scrap
value,
here
is
what
i
could
get
if
i
actually
scraped
it,
and
suppose
you
said
well
we
agree
with
you
that
if
you
scrapped
it
right
now,
that
is
the
net
realizable
value.
that
amount
would
be
the
amount
you
say
is
the
net
realizable
value
and
let's
assume
you
agreed
agreed
with
him,
you
still
would
let
him
write
it
down,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
but
you
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
he
gets
offers
from
people
who
are
buying
scrap
and
he
comes
in
and
says
at
page
86,
he
says
i
here
have
some
bona
fide
offers
for
my
inventory
and
scrap
value?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
modify
at
all,
take
my
example
for
a
minute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
just
don't
permit
[attempt
to
laughter]
on
the
page
86,
don't
permit
writing
down
for
just
excess
inventory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
why
did
you
cite
that
to
us
as
an
example
of
what
the
taxpayer
could
have
done
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
allow
them
to
write
off
any
inventory
of
any
item
that
had
been
unsold
for
at
least
a
year?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
the
test
of
obsolescence
no
sales
of
the
particular
item
for
a
year?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
know
whether
or
not
the
commissioner
allowed
write
off
for
obsolescence
merely
on
a
showing
that
an
item
had
not
been
sold
for
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
realized
loss.
