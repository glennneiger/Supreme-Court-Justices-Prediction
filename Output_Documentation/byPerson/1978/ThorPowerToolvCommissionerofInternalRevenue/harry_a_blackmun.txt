blackmun
mr.
berens
your
time
is
going
on,
but
sometime
before
you
sit
down
you
have
a
response
to
the
argument
that
the
inventory
evaluation
procedure
was
a
change
in
accounting
method,
the
government
makes
this,
and
i
would
like
to
get
your
response
to
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
at
your
convenience
just
before
you
sit
down.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it's
alright,
but

so

catch
it
sometime.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
want
to
be
sure
incidentally
mr.
berens,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
you
are
not
attacking
specifically
any
of
the
regulations
involved
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
smith,
in
this
connection
was
2
(f)
argued
to
the
courts
below?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
sure
of
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
is
a
federal
income
tax
case
and
it
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
that
court
has
had
the
united
states'
tax
court
before
it
decided
the
issues
in
favor
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
and
against
the
corporate
taxpayer.
there
are
two
issues
involved.
one
has
to
do
with
the
amount
of
an
addition
by
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
to
a
reserve
or
bad
debts.
and
the
other
concerns
inventory
write-downs
when
the
taxpayer
concludes
that
its
inventory
is
excessive.
these
obviously
are
not
issues
of
such
public
interest
as
to
merit
extended
comment
here
but
they
are
of
definite
concern
to
accountants
and
to
those
who
administer
the
income
tax
laws.
it
will
suffice
to
say
that
in
an
opinion
filed
today
the
court
unanimously
affirms
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
commissioner
did
not
abuse
his
discretion
when
he
ruled
that
the
inventory
write-down
effectuated
by
the
taxpayer
did
not
reflect
income
clearly
for
income
tax
purposes.
and
also
that
he
did
not
abuse
his
discretion
when
he
disallowed
in
part
the
taxpayer's
addition
to
its
bad
debt
reserve.
in
reaching
these
conclusions
we
emphasize
that
what
may
be
appropriate
for
accounting
purposes
does
not
necessarily
govern
for
income
tax
purposes.
