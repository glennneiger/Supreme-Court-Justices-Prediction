what
do
you
--
you
say
the
taxpayer
writes
the
inventory
down
to
net
realizable
cost?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
a
net
realizable
cost?
are
you
going
to
get
to
that?
is
that
different
than
what
you
think
the
scrap
value
will
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
is
the
inventory
held
rather
than
scrapped
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
make
a
mistake.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
some
experience
in
that
regard
as
to
what
percentage
of
the
inventory
that
thor
would
like
to
write
down
later
proves
to
be
salable
and
that
it
has
a
value?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
5%
of
the
items
were
taken
back
in
ordinary
sales,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless
--
even
so
there
would
have
been
isolated
or
recurring
instances
of
inventory
that
was
written
down
that
nevertheless
was
sold?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
difference
between
its
net
realizable
value
and
the
sales
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
things
are
segregated
so
you
know
which
inventory
you
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
if
an
item
that's
been
written
down
is
sold
at
the
same
--
at
what
it
used
to
be
sold
for?
how
do
you
--
you
just
put
that
amount
in
your
gross
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
ultimately
your
write
down
is
going
to
be
adjusted,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
scrap
it,
when
you
scrap
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
it's
scrapped
and
suppose
you
get
out
of
it
more
than
you
thought
you
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
get
less,
what
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
eventually
things
turn
out
accurately?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
--
you
just
talked
about
an
interpretation
of
the
regulation
with
which
you
disagree?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
the
interpretation
of
that
particular
regulation
is
contrary
to
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
did
you
run
into
284
us.
you
just
didn't
stumble
on
in
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
maybe
an
associate
was
working
for
a
partnership?[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
say
these
regulations
prohibited,
are
you
going
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
think
they
should
give
away?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
tax
court
finds
that
the
accountants
won't
certify
as
--
they
wouldn't
certify,
if
the
taxpayer
uses
your
method,
then
how
can
it
possibly
be
in
accord
with
best
accounting
practices?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
answered
mr.
justice
powell
that
there
was
a
finding
that
–
or
at
least
a
testimony
that
accountants
would
not
have
accepted
any
other
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
so
tell
me
again
now
mr.
smith,
i
asked
you
a
while
ago.
what
specific
provisions
in
these
regulations
is
the
--
prohibit
what
the
taxpayer
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
86
doesn't
now
you
have
conceded?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
86
is
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
doesn't
cover
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
it
was
running
with
the
prohibition
on
the
equipment.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
this
the
only
provision
you
are
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
else
in
the
–
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
what
part
of
the
regulation
was
that
particular
write
down
for
obsolescence
permitted?
