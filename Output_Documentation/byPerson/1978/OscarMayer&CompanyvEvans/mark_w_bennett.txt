mr.
mark
w.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
narrow
issue
before
the
court
today
involving
the
problem
of
statutory
construction
of
section
14(b)
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
has
been
considered
by
five
courts
of
appeals,
four
within
the
last
year.
the
court
below,
the
holiday
opinion
which
is
en
banc
unanimous
from
the
third
circuit
reversing
the
previous
decision
in
goger
and
the
gabriele
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
it
is
an
optional
prerequisite.
the
contrary
views
--
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
ten
years
after
it
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
as
the
secretary
pointed
out
in
the
brief
for
mr.
chief
justice,
six
of
the
members
were--
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
yeah
it
could
be.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
some
of
them
were
in
fact
in
the
team,
some
were
holdovers.
but
the
collective
wisdom
of
the
holiday
gabriele
and
the
court
bureau
established
three
major
principles.
one
is
that
section
14(b)
of
the
adea
is
not
the
mere
image
of
title
vii.
there
are
some
differences
which
i
will
get
to
and
i
think
those
differences
are
important
and
affect
the
interpretation
to
the
given
section
14(b).
secondly
the
legislative
history
of
the
adea
is
not
instructive.
it
is
perhaps
silent
on
the
proper
interpretation
to
the
given
section
14(b)
and
finally
that
absent
congressionally
expressed
intent
to
the
contrary
section
14(b)
should
be
construed
to
assist
the
intended
beneficiaries
of
the
act.
turning
to
the
first
proposition,
the
section
14(b)
is
not
the
mirror
image
of
section
706(c)
of
title
vii.
throughout
the
litigation
in
this
case
petitioners
would
have
us
believe
that
the
mere
incantation
of
the
analogy
that
section
706(c)
resolves
the
matter.
i
think
it
takes
additional
analysis,
the
language
is
not
identical.
under
section
706(c)
of
title
vii,
the
appropriate
terminology
is
no
charge
maybe
filed,
“with
the
eeoc.”
that
gives
a
state
a
mandatory
60-day
deferral
opportunity
to
deal
with
the
alleged
discrimination.
all
federal
action
is
precluded
and
the
filing
of
suit
is
likewise
precluded.
on
the
other
hand
under
section
14(b)
of
the
age
discrimination
employment
act
no
suit
maybe
brought.
however
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
previously
recognized,
this
allows
for
a
multitude
of
opportunities.
for
example,
there
can
be
simultaneous
jurisdiction
where
the
state's
deferral
agency
and
the
department
of
labor
go
at
it
simultaneously
or
the
state
can
go
first
or
that
the
federal
government
can
go
first
or
the
federal
government
can
go
first
or
the
state
can
go
first,
they
haven’t
clarified
it
in
the
statute.
now
the
effect
of
the
difference
in
the
language
is
this.
under
title
vii
the
states
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
for
60
days,
under
the
adea
there
is
no
exclusive
jurisdiction,
there
is
either
simultaneous
or
consecutive
in
any
order
that
the
claimant
may
go.
he
may
go
to
the
state
first
or
he
may
go
to
the
federal
first.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
i
am
not
sure
that
situation
would
arise
because
of
this
court’s
decision
in
log
which
said
or
at
least
it
seemed
to
intimate
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
state
agency
first.
in
other
words,
i
guess
the
answer
to
your
question
is
eeoc
will
not
accept
jurisdiction
until
the
state
has
its
60
days.
it
is
a
mandatory
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
well
because
in
title
vii
the,
i
think
they
specifically
said
that
the
state
must
be
given
the
60
day
period.
it's
not
the
language
of
706
but
the
language
of
another
section
in
title
vii,
just
like
in
the
adea
it's
not
the
language
of
section
14(b),
but
the
language
of
another
section.
in
other
words,
the
jurisdictional
prerequisites
in
the
adea
are
set
forth
in
section
7(d),
the
notice
with
the
department
of
labor.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
no
section
706(c)
has
been
interpreted
to
me
and
i
am
wrong.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
well
that’s
also
true
with
section
706(c).
the
sections
only
come
into
play
if
the
state
has
a
civil
rights
agency.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
well,
i
think
if
they
had
a
--
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
well
i
think
14(b)
says
you
have
option
of
going
to
the
state.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
in
a
state
that
does
not
a
have
law
mr.
justice
marshall,
there’s
no
state
exhaustion
requirement?
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
that
could
be,
that’s
obviously
not
the
interpretation
that
worried
you.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
it
was
done
on
the
petition
for
rehearing
filed
by
myself
and
the
--
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
believe
it
was
the
holding,
the
subsequent
inter
--
there
was
a
subsequent
holding
by
gabriele
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
between
the
time
when
we
orally
argued
the
case
and
the
time
when
we
file
the
petition
for
rehearing.
so
the
obvious
assumption
would
be
that
it
was
the
impact
of
the
gabriele
decision
on
the
eight
circuit.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
judge
wright
today
does
not
been
persuaded,
no.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
it
was
talbot
smith
sitting
by
designation
from
michigan.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
in
any
event
title
vii
--
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
yes,
one-one.
in
any
event
title
vii
strongly
emphasized
the
administrative
process.
the
adea
gives
less
difference
to
the
administrative
process
than
does
title
vii.
an
example
of
that
would
be
under
title
vii,
--
excuse
me,
under
title
vii,
the
state
agency
would
have
60
days
and
then
eeoc
would
have
a
120
days
and
at
the
time
the
adea
was
passed,
the
eeoc
either
had
to
make
finding
of
probable
cause
or
else
mediate
the
action
but
under
the
adea
for
any
reason
whatsoever
after
the
filing
of
the
60
days
the
complainant
can
cutoff
the
state
administrative
agency.
under
oscar
mayer’s
view
of
section
14(b),
they
still
get
a
different
result
in
under
title
vii
because
under
title
vii,
excuse
me,
they
would
still
get
a
different
result
because
under
title
vii
you
have
to
go
to
the
states
first
but
there’s
no
requirement
if
you
hold
that
section
14(b)
as
mandatory
that
we’d
have
to
the
states
first.
in
other
words
you
may
go
--
or
may
proceed
simultaneously
and
if
you
proceed
simultaneously
there’s
no
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
state
agencies.
it’s
hard
to
believe
the
congress
would
have
intended
every
claimant
to
make
a
prior
resort
to
the
state
even
after
going
to
the
secretary
of
labor
where
the
case
was
unable
to
be
conciliated
and
then
go
back
to
the
state
for
another
attempt,
when
the
first
attempt
was
fueled
before
they
could
file
a
suit.
i
don’t
think
that’s
what
this
section
entitled.
this
section
is
really
an
anti-preemption
section.
they
wanted
to
make
sure
and
show
the
states
that
section
14(b)
did
not
preempt
the
state’s
rights
to
have
laws
that
interpret
this
matter
in
the
same
way
as
the
adea.
in
fact
i
think
the
construction
we
are
urging
would
be
an
incentive
for
state’s
civil
right
agencies
to
have
stricter
enforcement
to
encourage
claimants
to
return
to
the
state.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
that
certainly
would
have
been
a
clearer
way
to
do
it
but
i
think
the
section,
you
know,
we
would
have
known
the
answer
had
they
done
that?
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
we
wouldn’t
be
here,
correct.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
it’s
interesting
to
note
under
the
legislative
history
that
there
is
a
total
lack
of
legislative
history
under
the
adea
where
under
title
vii
the
legislative
history
is
cleared
by
the
remarks
of
senator
humphrey
that
it
was
intended
to
go
to
the
states.
in
fact
i
cited
in
a
footnote
in
my
brief
that
at
least
two
courts
and
senator
javits
felt
that
the
courts
would
be
the
way
to
resolve
actions
under
the
adea
rather
than
the
administrative
bureaucracy
hence
the
streamlining
of
the
process.
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
the
legislative
history
cited
by
the
petitioners
in
this
matter.
they
cited
the
testimony
of
ed
conway
of
new
york
human
rights
commission
and
supported
their
position,
but
the
last
phrase
on
page
23
of
their
brief
is,
that
you
wanted
to
avoid
to
the
greatest
extent
possible,
the
coming
into
being
of
necessary
duplicities
effort,
i
would
suggest
that
the
construction
they
urge
that
would
require
simultaneous
or
consecutive
filings
with
both
the
state
and
federal
agency,
would
contribute
to
duplicitous
resources
at
the
federal
and
at
the
state
level.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
that
would
work
in
the
case
of
concurrent
filings
where
the
filings
took
place
at
the
same
time
but
if
an
individual
chose
to
file
with
the
department
of
labor
first
then
the
department
of
labor
is
under
a
mandate
to
use
those
60
days
and
then
maybe
on
the
61st
day
if
that
individual
is
within
his
statute
limitation
on
the
state
would
then
file
with
the
state
and
it
would
be
too
late
for
that
kind
of
cooperation
that
you
suggest.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
but
in
any
event
the
claimant
could
file
suit
in
the
federal
court
on
the
61st
day
because
that’s
all
the
time
the
statute
gives.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
under
this
statute?
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
that
is
incorrect.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
no,
there’s
a
68
waiting
period
with
the
department
of
labor
as
well
as
a
60
day
waiting
period
with
any
state
civil
rights
commission.
mr.
mark
w.
bennett
there’s
no
right
to
sue
letter.
he
controls
the
time
in
which
he
wishes
to
file
a
suit
rather
the
opposite
in
title
vii,
you
have
to
get
the
right
to
sue
letter
but
you
still
have
a
60
day
waiting
period
with
the
department
of
labor.
before
i
touch
on
the
final
argument
just
very
briefly,
i’d
like
to
address
the
question
of
noncompliance
with
section
14(b)
and
should
it
be
subject
to
equitable
considerations.
the
lower
court
decisions
on
this
issue
which
held
that
14(b)
was
mandatory
also
allowed
the
principle
of
equitable
modification
and
i
suggest
that
this
case
if
the
court
goes
against
us
on
the
14(b)
argument
is
the
kind
of
case
where
the
district
court
judges
should
be
allow
to
exercise
their
discretion
because
we
relied
under
the
statements
of
the
department
of
labor
that
we
did
not
have
to
comply
with
section
14(b).
thank
you.
