mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
under
section
14(b)
of
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act,
when
a
state
has
a
law
which
prohibits
age
discrimination
and
employment
and
has
established
an
agency
and
power
to
grant
relief
from
such
practices,
must
a
claim
of
age
discrimination
first
be
filed
with
that
state
agency
before
the
claimant
may
initiate
an
action
in
federal
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
maybe
stated
very
briefly.
respondent
joseph
evans
retired
in
january
1976
from
his
position
as
hog
buyer
for
oscar
mayer
in
iowa.
in
march,
1976,
mr.
evans
filed
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue
with
the
united
states
department
of
labor
claiming
that
he
had
been
forced
to
retire
in
violation
of
the
age
discrimination
act.
at
the
time
of
mr.
evans
alleged
forced
retirement,
the
iowa
civil
rights
act
prohibited
age
discrimination
in
employment
and
established
the
iowa
civil
rights
commission
to
investigate
an
attempt
to
conciliate
all
charges
of
age
discrimination.
in
addition,
the
iowa
civil
rights
commission
was
empowered,
if
it
was
unable
to
settle
a
charge
through
conciliation,
to
hold
hearings
and
if
it
found
that
a
discriminatory
practice
had
been
engaged
in
to
order
cease
and
desist
and
award
back
pay.
mr.
evans
ignored
the
available
avenue
of
state
relief.
he
did
not
a
file
a
claim
at
any
time
with
the
iowa
civil
rights
commission.
rather
one
year
after
he
had
filed
his
notice
of
intent
to
sue
with
the
united
states
department
of
labor,
he
instituted
an
action
in
the
federal
district
court
in
iowa.
the
defendants
in
that
action
and
petitioners
here
are
the
company
oscar
mayer
and
four
of
its
management
employees
who
were
involved
in
the
decision
with
respect
to
his
retirement.
oscar
mayer
and
the
other
defendants
in
the
trial
court
below
move
to
dismiss
the
action
for
the
reason
that
mr.
evans
had
failed
to
file
a
claim
with
the
iowa
civil
rights
commission
as
oscar
mayer
contended
was
required
by
section
14(b)
of
the
age
discrimination
act.
section
14(b)
requires
and
it
is
found
in
page
2
of
our
brief
and
i
quote
“in
the
case
of
an
alleged
unlawful
practice
occurring
in
a
state,
which
has
a
law
prohibiting
discrimination
in
employment
because
of
age
and
establishing
or
authorizing
a
state
authority
to
grant
or
seek
relief
from
such
discriminatory
practice,
no
suit
maybe
brought
under
section
626
of
this
title
before
the
expiration
of
60
days
after
proceedings
have
been
commenced
under
the
state
law
unless
such
proceedings
have
been
earlier
terminated.”
in
the
trial
court
in
response
to
the
motion
to
dismiss,
respondent
conceded
that
iowa
has
an
age
discrimination
law
and
that
it
has
established
an
agency
and
is
therefore
within
the
terms
of
section
14(b).
respondent
also
conceded
that
he
at
no
time
filed
a
charge
with
the
iowa
civil
rights
commission.
the
trial
judge
however
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss,
holding
the
filing
of
a
charge
with
the
state
agency
was
not
required
by
section
14(b)
as
a
prerequisite
to
instituting
action
in
the
federal
district
court.
rather
he
concluded
that
section
14(b)
gave
an
age
claimant
the
option
of
determining
whether
or
not
to
avail
himself
of
an
available
state
remedy.
trial
judge
certified
his
order
and
the
appeal
was
taken
to
the
eighth
circuit
under
section
1292(b).
in
its
first
decision,
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
the
trial
court
and
held
that
section
14(b)
did
require
prior
resort
to
the
state
agency.
on
rehearing,
the
eighth
circuit
changed
its
position
and
by
divided
panel
concluded
that
while
the
issue
was
not
free
from
doubt,
the
preferable
view
was
that
section
14(b)
gave
an
age
claimant
the
option
that
he
was
not
required
to
file
with
the
state
agency.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
one
judge
changed
his
mind
on
the
petition,
after
the
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed;
there
was
not
an
en
banc
here.
it
is
petitioner's
position
that
section
14(b)
establishes
a
prerequisite
with
--
which
must
be
complied
with
prior
to
instituting
action
in
federal
district
court.
it
is
our
position
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear
and
further
that
requiring
resort
to
an
available
state
remedy
is
completely
consistent
for
the
purposes
of
the
age
discrimination
act.
as
i
just
read
the
language
to
you,
it
specifically
says
where
a
state
has
a
law
and
an
agency
to
enforce
that
law,
no
suit
maybe
brought
under
section
626
of
this
title
before
the
expiration
of
60
days
after
proceedings
have
been
commenced
under
the
state
law.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
it
does
not
say
it
must
be
commenced,
but
it
says
no
suit
maybe
brought
and
i
think
if
you
will
look
at
section
7(b),
which
deals
with
filing
an
action
in
federal
court,
it
says
no
suit
maybe
commenced
until
notice
is
given
to
the
department
of
labor.
that
particular
provision
using
the
same
language
“no
suit
maybe
commenced”
is
uniformly
accepted
by
the
courts
as
requiring
the
filing
of
notice
of
intent
to
suit.
equally
is
important
this
language
in
section
14(b)
is
titled
precisely
after
language
which
appears
in
706(c)
of
title
vii,
which
is
also
quoted
at
page
2
of
our
brief
and
reads
almost
identically.
it
says
and
i
quote
“in
the
case
of
an
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice
occurring
in
a
state,
which
has
a
law
prohibiting
the
unlawful
employment
practice
alleged
and
establishing
or
authorizing
a
state
authority
to
grant
or
seek
relief
from
such
practice,
no
charge
maybe
filed
by
the
person
aggrieved
before
the
expiration
of
60
days
after
proceedings
have
been
commenced
under
the
state
law.”
now
that
particular
provision
has
been
uniformly
held
to
require
a
person
to
file
a
charge
with
the
state
agency
before
he
may
initiate
proceedings
under
title
vii.
indeed
this
court
in
decision
love
versus
pullman
agreed
with
that
position
of
the
lower
courts
and
it
is
our
position
and
just
like
in
title
vii,
requiring
prior
resort
to
a
state
agency
clearly
serves
the
purposes
of
the
age
and
discrimination
act
--
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
well,
i
think
–
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
language
--
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
could
technically
read
it
either
way,
but
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
fact
that
the
language
was
taken
from
title
vii
and
the
consistent
interpretation
of
title
vii,
i
think
the
far
better
reading
and
i
think
the
more
the
reading
which
i
think
gives
more
meaning
to
the
language
of
the
section
is
one
which
needs
it
as
a
requirement
and
it's
our
position
that
this
making
it
a
requirement
is
every
consistent
with
the
purposes
underlying
the
age
discrimination
act,
because
the
act
encourages
conciliation
of
disputes
rather
than
litigation
of
such
disputes
and
by
requiring
resort
to
state
agencies
you
maximize
the
possibility
of
a
non-judicial
resolution
of
such
disputes.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
in
1976
and
in
1977
over
5000
charges
of
age
discrimination
were
filed
each
year
with
the
united
states
department
of
labor
and
that
as
of
end
of
fiscal
1977,
there
was
a
backlog
of
over
2000
cases
before
the
department
of
labor,
this
with
respect
to
the
notices
of
intent
to
sue.
in
1977,
86
cases
were
filed
by
the
department
of
labor,
but
there
were
433
individual
actions
filed.
since
the
department
of
labor
has
enforcement
responsibilities
under
82
different
laws,
it's
not
easy
to,
it's
easy
to
see
why
this
backlog
is
growing
and
this
led
to
statements
of
congressional
concern
with
respect
to
the
handling
of
age
discrimination
claims
during
the
consideration
of
1978
amendments.
now
it
is
our
feeling
that
given
this
problem,
state
authorities
clearly
have
a
necessary
effective
and
viable
means
of
assisting
and
handling
this
growing
number
of
age
discrimination
complaints.
there
are
at
least
30
states
which
have
both
a
law
and
have
established
authorities
to
deal
with
age
discrimination
complaints
and
therefore
would
be
qualified
for
coverage
under
section
14(b).
given
the
number
of
states
which
have
acted
in
this
area,
we
think
they
have
a
clear
role
to
play.
if
the
position
of
the
respondent
is
accepted
and
a
petitioner,
excuse
me,
and
an
age
claimant
is
given
the
option
of
whether
or
not
to
file
with
the
state
agency,
he
is
in
a
position
to
ignore
the
state
agency,
file
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue
with
an
overextended
department
of
labor
and
then
proceed
immediately
in
the
federal
court.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
amicus
brief
concedes
that
the
state
agency
could
help
where
it
may
have
been
a
mistake,
which
led
to
the
charge
or
where
there
maybe
simple
facts.
however,
the
solicitor
contends
that
since
a
claimant
could
refuse
to
cooperate
with
a
state
agency
and
then
go
off
to
federal
court
that
you
should
not
require
a
claimant
to
file
a
charge
with
a
state
agency.
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
improper
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
should
be
required
to
file
a
charge
with
a
state
agency
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
he's
willing
to
cooperate
with
that
agency.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
that
if
you
look
at
the
history
which
led
to
title
vii,
it
was
very
clear
they
wanted
them
to
go
to
the
state.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
right,
when
they
adopted
this
provision
as
you
recall,
this
statute
when
it
was
first
proposed
had
a
national
labor
relations
board
type
procedure
then
through
various
discussions
it
was
amended
and
became
a
hybrid
of
section
of
some
title
vii
--
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
no,
there's
--
then
toward
the
end
of
the
consideration,
a
representative
of
organized
labor
and
a
representative
of
one
of
the
state
agencies
raised
the
question
with
congress
with
respect
to
the
possibility
that
the
age
discrimination
act
is
then
drafted
would
preempt
states
and
preclude
them
from
age
discrimination
enforcement
and
these
two
people
suggested
to
congress
that
they
follow
the
title
vii
procedure.
subsequent
to
that
testimony,
section
14(b)
was
added
to
the
act,
that's
all
of
the
legislative
history.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
there's
no
recorded
discussion
on
that
provision
either
way.
with
respect
to
the
question,
i
think
this
question
of
cooperation
or
lack
thereof
also
could
be
made
with
respect
to
title
vii,
yet
no
court
has
ever
said
that
the
reason
that
they
--
even
though
a
person
could
defeat
state
agencies
acting
in
title
vii
by
failing
to
cooperate,
he
should
be
excused
from
going
to
a
state
agency.
now
the
solicitor
and
the
respondent
both
rely
on
this
court's
opinion
in
lorillard
versus
pons
decided
last
term
where
this
court
held
that
there
was
a
right
to
a
jury
trail
for
age
discrimination
claimants
and
they
particularly
pointed
to
the
language
in
that
case
where
this
court
stated
the
title
vii
was
not
a
reliable
guide
to
interpreting
the
age
discrimination
act.
however,
the
court
did
recognize
in
that
opinion
that
the
age
discrimination
act
was
a
hybrid
taking
some
provisions
from
title
vii,
taking
some
provisions
from
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
that
therefore
they
pointed
out,
and
it's
at
page
582
of
the
opinion,
this
selectivity
the
congress
exhibited
in
incorporating
provisions
and
in
modifying
certain
fair
labor
standards
act
practices
strongly
suggest
that
but
for
those
changes
congress
expressly
made,
it
intended
to
incorporate
fully
the
remedies
and
procedures
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
now
it's
our
feeling
that
section
14(b)
is
clearly
one
of
those
exceptions.
the
language
is
taken
directly
from
title
vii.
there's
no
counterpart
of
that.
there
was
no
counterpart
of
that
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
so
we
feel
that
--
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
question
there
was
whether
or
not
you've
had
to
file
with
the
state
agencies.
as
i
understand
it
and
basically
this
has
been
conceded
by
the
solicitor
and
the
respondent
conceded
that
that
is
the
holding
that
has
been
attributed
as
being
a
holding
of
love
versus
pullman
by
lower
courts
and
conceded
in
the
briefs.
what
they
held
was
that
the
deferral
procedure
whereby
as
i
recall
the
opinion,
where
the
deferral
procedure
whereby
you
could
defer
a
case
if
it
was
a
charge,
as
initially
filed
at
eeoc
then
it
could
be
deferred
to
the
state
and
then
comeback
to
the
agency
after
60
days
and
that
satisfies
the
requirement
of
going
to
the
state.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
but
i
think
it
was
also
a
question
whether
you
had
to
file
with
the
state
as
well.
that's
my
--
as
i
say,
this
has
been,
the
respondent
and
solicitor
both
accept
that
proposition
and
the
courts
have
uniformly
accepted,
lower
courts
have
uniformly
cited
the
love
versus
pullman
case
for
the
proposition,
the
prior
resort
--
that
this
court
agreed
to
prior
resort
that
a
state
agency
was
required.
with
respect
to
the
lorillard
opinion
i
might
go
on,
this
court
did
also
state
in
there
that
where
congress
adopts
a
new
law
incorporating
sections
of
a
prior
law
that
normally
congress
will
be
presumed,
have
knowledge
of
the
interpretation
given
to
the
incorporated
law.
there
are
two
differences
between
the
age
discrimination
act
and
title
vii
to
which
solicitor
and
the
respondent
point.
one
being
that
you
may
file
a
concurrent
charge
with
both
the
department
of
labor
and
a
state
agency
under
the
age
discrimination
act.
we
do
not
feel
that
the
fact
that
you
can
file
a
concurrent
charge
means
that
the
stage
agency
should
be
ignored.
this
was
obviously
congress'
effort
to
speedup
the
administrative
process.
and
we
do
not
--
we
still
feel
that
a
state
can
play
a
meaningful
role
in
disposing
even
of
a
charge
which
is
filed
concurrently
with
the
charge
filed
with
the
federal
agency.
likewise,
i
think
the
fact
that
if
a
federal
lawsuit
is
filed
under
the
age
discrimination
act,
it
supersedes
the
filing
of
a
charge
before
a
state
agency.
i
do
not
think
that
means
that
a
state
agency
should
be
ignored.
this
provision
merely
avoids
duplication
once
a
lawsuit
has
been
instituted,
but
the
fact
that
a
state
agency
cannot
conclude
a
proceeding
does
not
mean
it
should
not
commence
the
proceeding,
because
if
it
is
making
meaningful
progress
there's
no
requirement
that
the
lawsuit
be
immediately
filed.
the
requirement
is
that
the
state
be
given
a
minimum
of
60
days,
a
petitioner
does
not
have
to
file
until
at
least
two
years
and
if
he
alleges
a
willful
violation,
three
years.
so
that
if
a
state
is
making
meaningful
progress,
he
does
not
have
to
go
to
court.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
thank
you.
[luncheon
break]
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
stevens
prior
to
a
lunch
you
asked
me
a
question
with
respect
to
love
versus
pullman.
having
reviewed
that
decision
over
lunch,
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
there
held
that
the
charge
of
discrimination
had
not
been
properly
filed
with
the
eeoc
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
act
and
this
court
then
specified
that
there
were
two
such
requirements.
one
being
706(b),
which
under
the
amendments
of
1972
became
706(c)
and
the
other
one
being
706(d),
which
was
dealing
with
the
time
within
which
it
needed
to
be
filed
with
eeoc.
this
court
then
reviewed
the
procedure
that
was
followed
there,
indicated
in
the
facts
there
had
been
a
referral
to
the
state
agency
and
the
state
agency
had
declined
to
act
and
then
the
court
held
that
the
procedure
complies
with
both
the
purpose,
excuse
me,
complies
with
the
purpose
both
of
706(b)
to
give
state
agencies
a
prior
opportunity
to
consider
discrimination
complaints
and
of
706(d)
to
ensure
expedition,
excuse
me,
to
ensure
expedition
in
the
filing
and
handling
of
those
complaints.
in
this
case,
it
has
been
assumed
and
presumed
by
all
to
have
held
that
you
had
to
have
to
take
a
prior
resort
to
a
state
agency
before
you
could
file
a
charge
under
title
vii.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
the
love
case
simply
held
that
there
had
been
in
the
procedure
that
was
followed
there.
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
recognizing
the
close
relationship
and
the
similarities
between
the
age
discrimination
act
and
title
vii,
in
february
1978,
president
carter
proposed
a
reorganization
of
civil
rights
enforcement
and
this
was
submitted
to
congress.
congress
did
not
act
and
therefore
this
reorganization
will
go
into
affect
and
pursuant
to
this
reorganization,
the
enforcement
of
the
age
discrimination
act
is
transferred
to
the
eeoc
has
of
july
1,
1979.
this
transfer
was
being
undertaken
to
avoid
confusion
and
the
overlapping
enforcement.
the
eeoc
has
throughout
its
history,
worked
closely
with
state
agencies
in
enforcing
discrimination
complaints
and
indeed
in
the
1972
amendments
to
the
title
vii,
if
the
eeoc
is
acting
on
a
commissioner's
charge
as
opposed
to
an
individual
charge,
it
still
must
refer
that
individual,
excuse
me,
that
commissioner's
charge
to
a
state
agency
before
it
may
undertake
its
investigation.
iowa
and
most
other
states
with
age
discrimination
statutes
have
the
same
agency
to
enforce
age
discrimination,
race
and
sex
discrimination
and
to
our
feeling
it
simply
makes
no
sense
to
treat
two
identically
awarded
statutory
provisions
to
be
enforced
by
the
same
agency
in
two
different
matters,
this
simply
will
not
reduce
the
confusion
to
which
the
president
was
referring
when
he
proposed
this
reorganization.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
there's
some
difference,
absolutely
correct.
the
procedures
are
more
streamlined,
there's
no
--
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
no
you
may
go
to
the
state.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
but
it
shows
less
deference,
but
it
doesn't
mean
it
shouldn't
go
to
the
state
at
all,
because
what
it
does
is,
it
sets
up
two
parallel
administrative
lines
to
be
pursued.
if
one
starts
taking
meaningful
action
with
respect
to
that,
then
it
may
resolve
and
attempt
to
conciliate
the
matter
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
litigation.
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
you
are
filing
concurrent
--
you
can
file
concurrently
means
that
you
can
ignore
one,
which
is
what
the
respondent's
position
here
is.
the
respondent's
position
is
the
claimant
should
--
the
age
claimant
should
determine
whether
he
wants
to
go
to
a
state
agency
or
not.
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
the
statutory
pattern
which
suggests
that
the
option
should
be
given
to
him
to
determine
whether
or
not
--
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
he
must
wait
a
minimum
of
60
days.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
he
can
at
the
minimum
--
after
a
minimum
of
60
days,
but
he
doesn't
have
to
go
to
court
at
the
end
of
60
days.
he
can
wait
for
two
years,
so
if
the
state
has
undertaken
a
meaningful
investigation,
is
attempting
to
resolve
the
matter,
there
is
no
requirement
that
at
the
end
of
60
days
he
goes
to
court,
it
simply
gives
him
that
option
after
60
days.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
no,
what
he
is
claiming
here
is
he
doesn't
have
to
go
to
the
state
at
all;
that
he
never
filed
a
claimant,
he
never
has
to
file
a
claim
with
the
state.
that
any
age
claimant
does
not
have
to
file
a
claim
with
the
state,
he
may
ignore
the
state
proceedings
completely.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
that's
his
contention.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
that's
correct,
because
in
terms
of
the
numbers
of
complaints,
in
terms
of
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
have
conciliation
of
these
matters
to
avoid
litigation.
the
effort
was
not
to
encourage
--
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
but
he
could
make
that
filing
contemporaneously
and
it's
our
feeling
that
this
encourages
--
what
it
does
is,
it
establishes
a
state
agency
which
has
an
ongoing
relationship
dealing
with
plans
with
respect
to
race
and
sex
charges
and
other
age
charges,
it
enables
those
local
people
that
have
been
dealing
with
claims
to
get
into
this
picture
and
attempt
to
resolve
this
matter,
so
that
we
don't
get
into
federal
litigation
over
an
age
discrimination
complaint
if
at
all.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
no,
there
is
no
legislative
history
in
those
terms
with
respect
to
the
1967
act.
it
was
very,
as
i
say
indicated
that
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
title
vii
was
very
specific
that
they
wanted
prior
resort
to
the
state
agency
and
the
1967
age
act
we
feel
adopted
that
language
and
therefore
adopted
basically
the
position
which
was
being
expressed
by
the
senators
with
respect
to
title
vii.
i
think
it's
important
at
this
point
to
turn
to
the
fact
that
although
there
was
no
change
in
section
14(b)
in
the
1978
amendments
to
the
age
discrimination
act,
the
solicitor
and
the
respondent
both
point
to
the
senate
report
which
was
adopted
by
the
conference
committee,
which
concluded
that
section
14(b)
had
not
been
intended
to
require
prior
resort
to
the
state
and
that
they
merely
been
intended
to
give
the
claimant
an
option.
it's
our
feeling
that
observations
10
years
after
the
passage
of
an
act
clearly
are
not
part
of
its
legislative
history.
in
addition,
in
1978,
as
a
solicitor
admits
in
his
brief
congress
amended
the
act
to
alter
judicial
decisions,
which
in
congress'
view
had
been
unfaithful
to
the
act
and
they
made
specific
amendments,
both
substantive
amendments
and
procedural
amendments.
first
of
all,
they
made
a
substantive
amendment
with
respect
to
retirement
plans
overruling
this
court's
opinion
in
the
mcmahon
case.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
notice
of
intent
to
sue
requirement,
the
secretary
of
labor
since
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
litigation
with
respect
to
what
is
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue
and
what
is
not
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue
they
made
a
change
saying
that,
making
it
simply
if
you
had
to
file
a
charge
with
the
department
of
labor.
they
also
made
a
change
with
respect
to
how
the
statute
of
limitations
was
to
be
treated,
saying
that
the
statute
could
be
told
during
the
period
of
time
when
the
secretary
was
undertaking
conciliation.
at
that
time
the
1978
amendments
were
being
considered,
the
only
two
courts
of
appeal
which
had
addressed
this
question
of
section
14(b)
had
both
held
that
prior
resort
to
a
state
agency
was
mandatory.
yet
congress
made
no
change
at
all
in
section
14(b)
and
the
fact
that
they
did
not
make
the
change
while
they
made
other
procedural
changes
seems
to
me
indicates
that
no
weight
should
be
given
to
the
senate
report,
which
was
part
of
the
legislative
history.
now,
the
respondent
and
the
solicitor
both
ask
this
court
that
even
if
this
court
adopts
the
position
that
section
14(b)
establishes
a
prerequisite
to
the
filing
of
an
action
under
the
age
discrimination
act
that
this
court
should
also
adopt
a
doctrine
of
equitable
modification
whereby
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
an
individual
age
claimant
should
be
able
to
show
why
it
should
be
excused
from
this
requirement.
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
what
this
position
entails.
they
are
not
asking
for
the
polling
of
the
statute
of
limitations
to
excuse
a
late
filing,
what
they
are
asking
is
to
be
excused
completely
from
the
filing
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
in
effect,
they
are
asking
this
court
to
say
that
courts
can
rewrite
the
statute
and
drop
the
requirement
altogether
if
the
person
can
present
sufficient
factual
circumstances
to
justify
that.
this
will
obviously
create
confusion
as
to
wonder
which
circumstances
there
would
be
a
private
right
of
action
and
under
which
circumstance
is
a
private
right
of
action
is
preserved
or
not
preserved.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
any
age
claimant
will
then
attempt
to
posit
to
the
court
a
set
of
circumstances,
which
would
justify
his
being
excused
if
he
has
not
filed,
which
creates
another
issue
and
we
feel
simply
encourages
litigation,
even
in
situations
where
courts
have
allowed
polling
in
the
statute
of
limitations,
they
have
made
every
effort
to
develop
a
very
much
objective
standard
of
polling,
so
as
to
avoid
long
requirement
issues
being
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
this
person
should
be
excused
from
the
requirement.
we
feel
that
in
short,
congress
did
not
change
section
14(b)
at
the
time
of
its
consideration
of
the
1978
amendments,
even
though
numerous
plaintiffs
had
their
cases
dismissed
on
those
grounds.
and
because
of
the
identity
of
the
language
between
title
vii
and
age
discrimination
act
and
the
obvious
benefits
from
state
participation
in
handling
the
ever
increasing
numbers
of
charges
in
this
area,
we
feel
that
this
clearly
indicates
that
court
should
reverse
the
eighth
circuit
and
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
dismiss,
thank
you.
mr.
james
w.
gladden,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
add
just
briefly
that
the
major
changes
administratively
that
were
made
were
in
response
with
the
eeocs
handling
of
charges
under
title
vii.
what
they
did
away
with
was
the
notice
of
right
to
sue,
the
fact
that
the
agency
had
to
make
a
finding
of
reasonable
cause,
those
are
the
things
that
were
changed,
they
also
gave
this
enforcement
to
the
department
of
labor
instead
of
the
eeoc,
those
are
the
things
that
were
changed
with
respect
to
going
to
a
state
or
not
going
to
state,
the
language
of
14(b)
is
identical.
and
i
might
also
point
out
than
with
respect
to
filing
a
charge
with
the
department
of
labor,
the
section
7(b)
provides
that
if
you
do
go
to
--
if
you’re
in
a
state
which
is
covered
by
14(b)
you
have
300
days
to
file
your
charge
to
the
department,
you
notice
to
intent
to
sue
are
now
a
charge
to
the
department
of
labor.
if
you’re
not
in
a
state
covered
by
14(b)
you
only
have
a
180
days.
clearly
that’s
giving
deference
to
the
state.
it’s
encouraging
the
party
to
go
to
the
state
because
it
extents
its
period
of
time
over
which
you
can
come
to
the
federal
government
if
the
state
doesn’t
start
moving
along
in
a
meaningful
way.
that
180,
300
day
pattern
is
exactly
the
same
pattern
that
is
followed
under
title
vii.
so
with
respect
to
the
states
and
the
effective
filing
a
charge
or
notice
to
the
state,
the
pattern
is
identical
in
the
age
discrimination
act
to
title
vii.
the
changes
that
were
made
had
to
do
with
what
the
eeoc
had
been
required
to
do
under
title
vii
as
opposed
to
what
the
department
of
labor
was
required
to
do
and
that
was
an
effort
to
speedup
the
administrating
process
primarily
at
the
federal
level.
thank
you
very
much.
