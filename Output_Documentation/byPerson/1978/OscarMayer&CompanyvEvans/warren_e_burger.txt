chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
oscar
mayer
&
co
against
evans.
mr.
gladden
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counselor,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
gladden.
mr.
ryan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
fair
to
say
from
your
opening
remark,
that
if
the
eighth
circuit
had
gone
the
other
way
you
would
not
have
brought
the
case
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
conflict
alone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
your
friend
has
suggested
that
and
i
suppose
we
can
judicially
notice
the
fact
that
most
claims
of
this
kind
are
subject
to
the
settlement
via
conciliation
and
negotiation.
now
starting
from
that
premise,
if
that's
true
and
we
are
trying
to
look
at
the
statute,
it's
not
very
clear,
wouldn't
it
make
sense
that
congress
would
prefer
to
disperse
this
as
i
think
he
suggested
among
the
states
rather
than
having
it
all
concentrated
in
the
federal
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
the
desirable
without
a
dozen
reasons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
way
the
secretary
of
labor
might
employ
to
settle
it
would
be
cooperation
and
coordination
of
state
agencies,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
if
the
state
has
an
agency
which
is
established
a
record
in
the
minds
of
the
secretary
of
labor
as
being
effective
and
prompt,
reasonably
so
and
the
secretary
of
labor
would
perhaps
hold
his
hand
and
say
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
there
is
no
agency,
then
there
is
no
problem,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
is
no
agency
that
should
be
rather,
a
question
readily
answered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
simplify
it,
no
matter
what
we
do,
if
we
decide
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
conditions
change
in
the
various
states
it's
a
simple
matter
of
congress
to
modify
this
problem
if
they
think
a
problem
flows--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
ryan.
mr.
bennett?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
legislative
history
largely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
legislative
history,
11
years
after
the
event,
is
that
the
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ten.
perhaps
different
members
of
congress
who
were
not
even
members
of
congress
when
the
act
was
passed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
said
it
could
be,
not
were?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
could
be
an
entirely
new
team?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
couldn't
they
solve
it
as
i
have
read
that
some
states
have
solved
it
that
when
the
papers
are
filed
with
the
state
agency,
they
notify
the
federal
and
vice-versa
and
they
work
on
a
coordination
that
if
one’s
going
ahead
the
other
one’s
state
is
examined.
isn’t
that
administratively,
any
relatively
easy
problem
to
solve?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
would
it
be
too
late,
the
secretary
of
labor
or
no
other
agency
in
the
government
work
so
swiftly
that
it
would
have
gone
very
far,
it
couldn’t
do
work
coordination
on
the
61st
day?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
is
no,
under
the
statutory
scheme
that
can’t
be
avoided
by
coordination
i
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
gladden?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
