mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
hard
case.
it
is
hard
because
the
statutory
language
is
so
ambiguous
that
it
can
support
either
alternative
before
the
court
and
because
the
petitioner
has
advanced
appealing
arguments
in
his
brief,
the
reversal
of
the
result
reached
below
will
alleviate
congestion
in
the
federal
courts,
but
these
arguments
are
more
seductive
than
they
are
persuasive
as
i
will
show.
first,
let
us
keep
matters
in
perspective.
there
is
no
question
that
a
person
with
a
complaint
of
age
discrimination
may
vindicate
his
right
in
federal
court.
he
is
required
to
give
the
secretary
of
labor
60
days
notice
of
his
intent
to
do
so,
which
is
now
a
charge
as
a
result
of
the
78th
amendment
and
during
that
60
days
the
act
requires
the
secretary
to
attempt
to
bring
about
conciliation
through
informal
methods
of
persuasion.
the
question
here
before
this
court
is
whether
the
act
also
erects
an
additional
procedural
obstacle
that
the
plaintiff
must
clear
before
he
can
go
to
federal
court.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
i
think
by
the
time
by
the
eighth
circuit
decided
this
case,
there
was
a
pretty
pronounced
conflict
among
the
circuits
and
i
think
that
by
itself
would
have
justified
certiorari.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
question
here
is
whether
the,
in
addition
to
giving
the
secretary
60
days
to
settle
the
case
the
complainant
must
also
in
effect
give
the
state
60
days
to
do
the
same
thing,
if
the
discrimination
took
place
in
a
state
that
has
an
agency
setup
to
handle
age
discrimination
claims.
now
we
are
not
talking
here
in
this
case
about
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
petitioner
concedes
that
the
most
of
the
statute
can
require
is
that
the
claimant
file
his
charge
with
the
state
agency
and
then
wait
60
days.
after
that
60
days,
the
claimant
has
an
unfettered
right
to
go
into
federal
court
regardless
what
the
state
may
or
may
not
have
done
to
his
complaint
in
the
mean
time.
that
requirement
if
this
court
holds
that
it
is
a
requirement
is
we
think
a
procedural
monkey-wrench
in
the
administration
of
this
act
that
will
serve
neither
the
states
nor
the
plaintiffs
nor
the
federal
courts.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
that
if
this
court
finds
that
that
is
what
congress
intended
then
we
agree
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
think
this
court
has
the
opportunity
to
construe
an
admittedly
ambiguous
statute,
at
least
we
--
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
that's
what
petitioner
says.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
no
i
don't,
i
am
sorry;
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that
it
was.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
i
would
like
to
relay
on
that
presumption
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
[attempt
to
laughter].
experience
shows
that's
not
always
a
safe
presumption
to
the
rely
on.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
i'm
sorry
i
don't
understand.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
that
is
the
question
that
the
federal
court
will
have
to
answer
when
the
case
ends
up
there.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
that
is
--
in
fact
that
is
the
question
that
has
been
much
litigated
where
plaintiffs
have
gone
to
state
agencies.
they
go
into
the
federal
court
and
the
employer
says
now,
wait
a
minute
you've
been
to
state
agency,
but
did
you
file
in
time,
did
you
file
sufficiently,
did
you
file
on
the
proper
form,
did
you
comply
with
all
of
this
state
procedural
requirements
that
the
state
act
sets
up.
and
then
the
federal
–-
the
district
court
has
to
decide
that
entire
round
of
questions
that's
why
we
say
it's
really
not
so
that
to
hold
--
that
the
complainant
must
go
to
a
state
agency
will
alleviate
any
burden
of
the
federal
courts.
it
will
do
no
such
thing
in
our
opinion.
it
will
simply
place
a
new
round
of
questions
before
the
federal
court
in
that
time
when
the
plaintiff
finally
ends
up
there.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
well
i
think
they
would
much
prefer
to
have
cases
like
this
settled
rather
than
litigated
and
i
think
that's
no
question
about
it
and
that's
-–
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
without
any
doubt
at
all
and
i'm
sure
that
given
that
choice
every
member
of
congress
would
have
said
we
favor
conciliation
and
settlement.
what
they
did
in
response
to
that
concern
in
our
view
is
they
gave
it
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
they
said;
“thou
shall
not
file
a
suit
in
federal
court
until
you
have
gone
to
the
secretary
of
labor
and
given
him
at
least
60
days”
and
then
it
said
to
the
secretary
of
labor,
“you
are
obligated
to
make
every
attempt
within
the
60
days
to
settle
this
claim.”
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
that
is
in
his
discretion
one
path
that
he
might
to
choose.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
that
is
a
choice
that
the
act
leaves
open
in
the
sense
that
it
doesn't
preclude
it,
but
there
are
two
points
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
in
that
regard.
one,
not
every
state
has
an
agency
of
this
sort.
in
fact,
the
petitioner
says
30
and
i
see
no
reason
to
dispute
that.
so
that
leaves
20
states
without
an
agency
of
any
kind.
the
second
–-
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
problem
in
the
sense
that
if
a
plaintiff
goes
directly
into
federal
court,
the
employer
is
free
to
raise
the
question
and
say
is
this
the
state
which
requires
resort
to
state
procedures
and
this
puts
another
question
in
front
of
the
federal
court
that
it
must
act.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
it's
not
readily
answered
as
easily
as
it
sounds,
because
there
are
cases
in
which
federal
courts
have
said,
have
opened
the
statute
books
and
said
there
are
some
statutes
in
here
that
prohibit
discrimination
in
one
way
or
another.
does
this
fall
within
the
type
of
statute
that
congress
had
in
mind?
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
no
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
it
does
not
depend
on
that,
but
when
the
plaintiff
goes
into
the
federal
court
not
having
gone
to
any
state
agency
at
all,
the
employer
is
certainly
entitled
to
raise
as
one
of
the
questions
that
the
federal
court
must
decide,
we
are
in
a
deferral
state
and
this
man
is
not
to
deferred.
so,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
to
hold
that
an
employee
must
go
to
the
state
agency
as
a
general
rule
of
law
is
not
going
to
alleviate
any
burden
on
the
federal
courts.
in
fact,
the
predictable
effect
is
going
to
be
to
further
embroil
federal
courts
in
these
matters
that
is
just
one
aspect
of
this
case,
but
it's
important.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
assuming
that
the
law
doesn't
change
in
that
state,
yes.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
i
would
think
not.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
i
would
answer
that
mr.
justice
stevens
by
saying
that
has
been
the
way,
it
has
always
been
understood.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
well,
certainly
not
in
this
case
and
i
don't
think
that
we
do
in
other
cases.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
well,
i
would
--
my
answer
was
that
is
the
way
it
has
always
been
understood.
love
versus
pullman
did
not
pass
on
that
question.
in
fact,
i
think
a
proper
reading
of
love
would
indicate
that
the
plaintiff
is
required
to
go
the
eeoc
before
he
goes
to
federal
court,
something
that's
perfectly
–
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
yes,
i
won't.
i
cannot
shy
from
that,
that's
true.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
well,
the
difference
is
that
in
title
vii
there
is
an
unmistakable
legislative
history
that
shows
that
prior
resort
to
the
states
was
required.
senator
humphrey
and
senator
dirk
said
on
both
sides
of
the
isle
said
this
is
what
we
intend
and
perhaps
as
a
result
of
that
then
anything
else.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
in
title
vii.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
i
disagree
with
the
petitioner
on
that
score.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
we
are
talking
here
about
--
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
it's
not
the
same
section.
it
is
--
we
admit
as
we
have
to
that
the
language
is
similar.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
it
is
not
identical.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
it
is
similar.
it
is
not
identical,
correct.
and
as
you
pointed
out
before
lunch
sir,
we
are
construing
a
separate
statute
here.
we
are
not
construing
title
vii
in
this
action.
we
are
construing
the
adea
and
there
is
no
legislative
history
in
the
adea,
which
speaks
specifically
to
this
point.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
i
would
be
happy
to
give
you
something
to
cite.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
the
structure
of
the
adea
is
different
from
the
structure
of
title
vii
in
terms
of
utilizing
state
remedies
and
utilizing
federal
remedies.
there
are
a
number
of
distinctions
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
where
congress
clearly
intended
something
different
for
adea
and
part
of
the
reason
as
senator
javits
and
others
mentioned
in
the
debate
is
that
they
were
most
unimpressed
with
the
conduct
of
many
state
agencies.
they
felt
that
the
state
agencies
and
this
is
only
two
years
after
title
vii
or
three
years
after
title
vii
had
passed
that
many
of
the
state
agencies
simply
were
not
equipped
to
deal
with
these
discrimination
complaints.
now,
as
a
result
of
that,
they
made
unmistakable
changes
in
adea.
for
example,
they
did
not
require
a
right
to
sue
letter
from
the
federal
agency.
the
plaintiff
can
go
into
federal
court
60
days
after
he
notifies
the
secretary
without
any
further
ado.
they
did
not
require
for
example,
that
any
state
remedy
be
resorted
to
first.
they
showed
as
my
opponent
mentioned
in
his
argument,
the
adea
does
show
less
difference
to
the
states
than
title
vii.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
so,
that
is
why
--
that
is
my
answer
to
that
question,
that
while
congress
may
have
used
similar
language
this
court
is
certainly
free
to
look
at
the
acts
themselves
and
see
that
the
structure
is
different.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
the
--
i
am
sorry
sir.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
i
would
not
say
it
was
intended
to
give
no
difference.
it
was
intended
to
give
a,
well
i
am
sorry
if
by
deference
you
mean
a
mandatory
deferral
to
state
procedures
then
i
agree
it
was
not
intended
to
do
that.
it
was
intended
to
give
the
state
some
opportunity
if
the
plaintiff
chose
to
go
there.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
that
the
plaintiffs
would
have
been
free
to
go--
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
they
would
have
but
then
it
would
have
gotten
into
some
of
the
problems
which
this
court
mentioned
in
love
versus
pullman
which
of
course,
which
yet
to
be
decided
in
1967.
for
example
could
he
go
to
a
state
agency
and
then
go
into
a
federal
court
if
the
state
agency
found
no
probably
cause
or
if
the
state
agency
for
that
matter
found
no
discrimination
whatever,
would
he
have
res
judicata
problem.
there
were
any
number
of
questions
that
could
readily
be
imagined
if
this
statute
did
not
address
the
proper
relationship
between
state
and
federal
agencies,
so
by
passing
section
14(b)
what
they
were
saying
is
you
can
go
to
the
states
if
you
want
to,
we
don't
want
to
shut
off
the
states
all
together,
but
it
is
our
position
congress
speaking,
it
is
our
position
that
after
60
days
you
are
free
to
vindicate
whatever
rights
you
have
under
this
act.
so
i
think
in
that
sense
it
was
not
clear,
and
certainly
not
1967.
i
think
that,
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
this
act,
the
adea
has
an
unusual
number
of
procedural
difficulties
and
any
look
at
the
reported
decisions
i
think
will
bear
that
out.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
simplify
this
act,
not
to
complicate
it.
it
can
construe
this
ambiguity
as
we
say
reasonably
either
way.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
i
respectfully
disagree
sir.
i
think
that
while
if
you
reverse
the
judgment
below
you
will
have
answered
the
question.
you
will
not
have
simplified
the
administration
of
the
act,
because
every
act
henceforth
will
have
to
answer
the
number
of
questions
that
i
raise
namely
was
the
compliance
with
the
state
procedures
in
this
case
sufficient.
it's
just
going
to
--
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
it
is
simple
for
congress
to
modify
it
in
either
way.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
and
certainly
if
congress
does
not
like
what
this
court
says,
it
can
change
it,
it
did
that
in
mcmahon
and
it
can
do
that
in
this
case
if
it
wants
to,
but
our
position
is
that
given
that
choice
to
complicate
the
act
or
to
simplify
it
that
this
court
should
simplify
it
and
if
congress
wants
to
change
it
that’s
up
to
congress,
but
until
that
time
congress
--
the
act
the
purpose
of
this
act
gives
individuals
a
right
in
federal
courts
to
vindicate
claims
of
age
discrimination
should
be
supported
by
this
court
and
not
submitted
to
a
continuing
round
of
procedural
questions.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
it
becomes
effective
this
coming
summer
july
1st
1979,
yes
sir.
mr.
allan
ryan,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
my
understanding.
