justice
byron

white
but
there's
some
difference
between
the
procedures,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
have
to
go
the
state
before
you
go
to
the
federal
now,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
quite
a
substantial
difference?
that
certainly
shows
a
good
deal
less
deference
to
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
must
he
file
with
the
federal
people
before
he
goes
to
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
long
does
he
have
once
he
files
with
the
federal
people,
how
long
does
he
have
to
wait?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
can't
ignore
the
federals,
but
he
can
ignore
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
contention
is
that
of
course
he
has
to
file
with
the
federal
people,
but
he
has
to
file
with
the
state
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
he
files
with
the
federal
people
and
waits
60
days,
he
still
is
going
to
have
to
file
with
the
state
and
wait
60?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
explanation
in
the
legislative
history
as
to
why
there
was
no
requirement
of
resorting
to
state
procedures
before
resorting
to
the
federal
procedures?
