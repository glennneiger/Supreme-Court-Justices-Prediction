justice
potter
stewart
and
the
love
case
simply
held
that
there
had
been,
there
had
been
compliance?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
court
finds
that
the
language
of
the
statute
provides
just
that,
however,
the
fact
that
it
may
be
a
procedural
money-wrench
is
none
of
our
business,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
you
who
admits
ambiguous,
you
claim
it
is
ambiguous
and
so
does
the
respondent,
but
petitioner
says
it
is
very
clear.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
is
not
at
all
conceded
that
this
is
an
ambiguous
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
question
is
not
does
the
state
law
require
a
resort
to
state
procedures.
the
question
as
i
understand
is
if
the
state
has
a
law
prohibiting
discrimination
in
employment
because
of
age
and
establishing
or
authorizing
a
state
authority
the
grant
or
blah,
blah
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
depend
at
all
upon
whether
the
state
does
or
does
not
require?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
once
it
were
decided
in
any
district
that
that
state
does
have
a
law
or
that
state
doesn't
have
a
law,
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
for
future
cases,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wouldn't
be
repeatedly.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
certainly
not
identical
language?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
difference
in
the
language?
justice
potter
stewart
the
sixth
circuit
was
judge
smith’s
circuit,
he
was
the
district
judge
in
ann
harbor,
michigan
when
he
--
was
this
is
this
talbot
smith?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
sixth
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
need
not
go
to
the
federal
administrative
agency
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
under
this
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
file
a
suit?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
doesn’t
have
to
get
a
right
to
sue
letter?
