justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gladden
it
doesn't
say
that
proceedings
must
be
commenced
under
the
state
law
now,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
arguing
that
the
similar
language
had
been
construed
and
that
we
should
follow
that
construction,
but
i
was
suggesting
to
you
that
the
language
itself
was
not
entirely
unambiguous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
unlike
section
7(b)
which
says
that
until
the
individual
has
given
the
secretary
notice
there
is
nothing
here
that
requires
that
the
proceedings
be
commenced
before
the
state
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
read
it
either
way
is
all
i
am
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
with
a
question
before
the
noon
hour,
so
you
may
want
to
think
on
that
over
lunch.
you
have
cited,
and
i
think
this
love
against
pullman
as
holding
that
under
title
vii,
it's
a
jurisdictional
requisite
that
you
go
to
the
state
agency
first.
i
don't
see
that
the
case
really
held
that.
is
there
anything
in
the
opinion
that
even
says
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
went
to
a
question
of
timeliness
i
think,
whether
there
was
any
question
about
it
being
filed
in
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ryan
can
–
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
help
me
with
a
problem
i
was
concerned
with
before
lunch.
do
you
agree
that
section
706(c)
of
title
vii,
which
i
guess
has
identical
language
in
it,
does
require
a
prior
filing
with
the
state
in
the
title
vii
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
government
doesn't
question
that
understanding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
what
really
we
are
being
asked
to
do
is
to
say
that
the
identical
language
in
two
similar
statutes
has
different
meaning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
think
love
really
squarely
decided,
but
it
seems
to
me,
this
is
something
everybody
is
assuming
for
purposes
of
the
decision
in
this
–
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so,
really
what
it
boils
down
to
is,
you
are
asking
us
to
construe
precisely
the
same
language
in
similar
statutes
in
different
ways?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree
that
under
title
vii
even
if
the
complaining
party
does
not
file
anything
with
the
state,
he
still
must
wait
60
days
before
he
can
file
a
charge
with
the
eeoc,
you
agree
with
that?
in
other
words,
the
60
day
waiting
period
is
not
contingent
on
an
actual
filing
with
the
state
under
title
vii?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
if
that’s
fair
reading
of
that
language
as
mandatory
why
except
for
that
there
was
to
be
no
charge
and
no
suit,
why
doesn’t
dramatically
the
same
language
lead
to
the
same
result
in
the
other
statute?
we
have
an
english
grammar
problem
here.
once
you’ve
agreed
that
it
reads
that
way
in
one
statute,
why
doesn’t
it
read
the
same
way
in
the
other
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
section
in
the
title
vii
that
requires
prior
resort
to
the
state
agency
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
it’s
not
this
section?
i
was
under
impression
from
all
the
argument
that
this
is
the
source
of
the
requirement
they
go
to
the
state
first.
but
then
you
are
saying
the
same
language
doesn’t
impose
the
similar
requirement
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
