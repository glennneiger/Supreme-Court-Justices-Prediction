justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
congressional
history
that
supports
you
that
you
have
go
through
the
state
first?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
answer
is
going
to
be
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
nobody
--
no
man
of
congress
said
a
word
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
[inaudible]
that
the
complaining
part
only
had
probably
a
piece
of
paper
work
to
state
or
–
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
any
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
order
to
do
what
petitioners
says
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
would
it
be
satisfactory
if
the
complainant
merely
files
a
piece
of
paper
with
the
wisconsin
agency
or
ohio
or
whatever
it
is,
saying
i've
been
done
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
–
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
pertinent
legislative
history?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
according
to
this
when
you
abide
that,
you
also
abide
that
legislative
history?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
he
says
you
abide
and
obey
it
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
taking
to
the
whole
thing,
aren't
you?
you
say
it's
a
same
section?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
brother
steven
says
is
that,
we
say
that
these
two
sections
are
not
identical,
but
are
so
also
similar
that
we
can't
decide
the
difference
between
the
two
and
however
we
do
find
that
one
means
something
different
from
the
other.
now,
i
can
write
that
much
if
i
was
writing
an
opinion,
but
when
i
got
to
citing
to
some,
i'd
be
in
a
lot
of
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
aged
act
did
not
have
any
difference
to
the
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
act
we
have
here
was
not
intended
to
give
any
difference
to
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
section
only
implies
to
states
like
ours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
mean
the
old
section
not
just
this
bottom,
it
starts
all.
it
says
in
cases
like
iowa,
this
will
apply
that’s
what
it
says.
well,
it
doesn’t
that
lead
some
credence
to
the
fact
that
they
do
expect
to
use
the
state
machinery?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we’re
making
a
separate
rule
for
states
that
have
state
machinery,
from
states
that
don’t
have
state
machinery,
isn’t
that
what
14(b)
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
let
me
read
it
says,
in
the
case
of
alleged
age
discriminate
occurring
in
a
state
which
has
a
law,
well
what
is
the
provision
to
state
it
does
not
have
a
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
whole
point
is
that
this
could
be,
once
you
get
into
state
that
does
have
such
law,
you
have
to
the
go
to
the
state
machinery
first?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
have
to
be,
obviously.
