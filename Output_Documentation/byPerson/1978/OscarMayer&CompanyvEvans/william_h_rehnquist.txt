justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
even
under
your
theory,
the
claimant
can
forget
about
the
state
proceedings
at
the
expiration
of
60
days,
can
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that's
all
he
is
claiming
here,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
relying
on
a
presumption
that
congress
does
not
create
procedural
money-wrenches?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
would
have
that
without
this
section,
wouldn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
has
been
anti-preemption
provisions
though
in
civil
rights
acts
that
are
far
--
simply
say
nothing
in
this
actual
preempt
state
provisions
that
go
further,
without
saying
being
as
expressed
but
going
into
the
state
procedures
as
this
one
does?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
would
not
be
all
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
might,
but
you
wouldn't.
