justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
topkis,
you
answered
earlier
about
the
other
two
networks,
apparently
they
have
long-term
licenses
of
four
or
five
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
how
long
the
license
of
cbs
was
that
expired
in
69?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
take
the
situation
in
1966
or
so
when
they
mind
of
started
negotiating
independently,
were
they
been
under
a
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
expiring
when?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
would
the
license
that
was
in
effect
in
1966
or
67
expire?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
were
they
obligated
with
the
fee
uncertain,
were
they
obligated
to
comply
with
the
blanket
license
for
the
next
two
or
three
years,
66
or
67?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
term
it
at
will?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
am
concerned
with
is
their
argument,
it
does
not
make
much
sense
to
go
out
and
get
separate
licenses
when
you
are
already
obligated
--
you
already
have
the
right
to
all
the
music
under
the
blanket
license
and
then
the
effect
would
be
paying
twice
for
the
same
music
and
i
am
just
wondering
were
they
obligated
to
pay
under
a
blanket
license
during
the
period
when
you
suggest
they
should
have
been
negotiating?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
arrangements
between
ascap
and
its
members
which
would
preclude
ascap
from
licensing
a
portion
of
its
portfolio?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that
is
not
my
question.
the
question
is,
is
there
anything
that
would
prevent
ascap
if
it
is
so
decided
to
say
just
license
one
kind
of
music
separately
from
the
entire
portfolio?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
let
us
start
my
question.
say
you
have
100
members
in
four
different
categories,
just
assume,
one
is
classical
music
and
other
is
popular
and
the
other
is
vault.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
that
would
prevent
ascap
if
it
thought
it
would
be
advisable
to
license
a
package
just
containing
vaults
so
to
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
all
of
irving
berlin's
go
in
the
same
category,
could
you
license
a
irving
berlin
and
ten
other
composers
as
a
separate
smaller
package
without
breaching
an
agreement
with
any
of
your
members
or
is
there
an
agreement
among
the
members
that
you
must
license
everything
as
a
blanket,
that
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
studiously
avoid
answering
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
you
are
telling
us
is
that
the
cbs
if
it
go
to
separate
publishers
and
say
we
want
a
license
your
portfolio
of
music,
i
am
asking
you
if
they
could
say,
go
to
ascap
and
say
we
would
like
to
license
just
the
music
published
by
x?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
finding
in
the
record
that
the
judge
did
find
that
there
would
be
publishers
who
would
lineup
at
cbs
door,
but
is
there
any
finding
with
respect
to
what
percentage
of
the
total
inventory
of
music
could
be
obtained
by
direct
licensing
if
they
cancel
the
blanket
license
which
i
suppose
they
would
have
to
do
before
they
would
wanted
to
do
any
separate
licensing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
problem
i
take
it
is
with
the
feature
music
primarily,
the
feature
programs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
finding
as
to
how
much
of
the
feature
music
that
would
be
needed
for
their
programming,
they
could
obtain
through
direct
licensing
if
they
cancel
the
blanket
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
findings
don't
differentiate
among
who
would
be
lining
up
at
cbs's
door,
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
they
police
it
now?
does
ascap
do
it
for
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
not
ascap
generally
police
the
transmissions
and
music
such
as
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
had
some
problem
understanding
the
whole
policing
concept.
supposing
that
this
3m
program
just
never
asked
for
a
license
anywhere,
they
just
started
selling
to
doctors
and
doctors
started
playing
records
in
their
office,
would
not
ascap
police
that
activity
just
as
part
of
their
general
undertaking
to
engage
in
policing
for
their
members?
justice
john
paul
stevens
miss
kearse,
in
the
warner
brother
situation
where
the
broadcasters
who
are
not
interested
in
dealing
directly,
do
they
have
blanket
licenses
already?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
so
they
would
had
to
choose
in
effect
between
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
have
had
them
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
why
the
broadcasters
would
not
take
the
warner
portfolio?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
what
inference
do
you
draw
from
the
refusal
for
them?
what
does
that
tend
to
prove?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
they
are
charging
too
much
money
or
they
did
not
like
the
music.
i
mean
from
that
one
instance
you
draw
the
inference
that
the
user
is
the
one
who
dictates
the
terms
of
the
bargain.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
easterbrook,
does
the
united
states
have
a
view
as
to
whether
or
not
the
blanket
licensing
here
has
any
impact
on
the
price
level?
justice
john
paul
stevens
also
mr.
easterbrook,
ascap
has
to
operate
under
the
provisions
of
that
consent
decree
which
gives
judicial
supervision
or
at
least
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
slower
it
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
sure
you
have
answered
my
question.
my
question
is
does
the
united
states
have
a
view
as
to
whether
or
not
the
practice
of
blanket
licensing
by
the
two
large
sellers
involved
here
has
an
impact
on
the
price
level?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
anything,
it
sounded
like
you
are
saying
it
tended
to
lower
the
price.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
do
not
have
a
view,
you
can
simply
say,
no
you
do
not
have
a
view.
if
you
do,
i
would
like
to
know
what
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
have
understood
your
analysis
of
proceed
to
have
some
relationship
to
your
judgment
about
the
economics
of
the
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
think
it
is
just
that
the
copyright,
individual
copyright
holders
just
know
when
they
would
be
doing
a
useless
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
have
to
pay
for
such
license,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
have
to
pay
something.
i
do
not
imagine
the
publishers
just
as
a
matter
of
its
charity
just
say,
here,
you
can
have
this
option.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
gahter,
but
would
not
you
agree
there
must
a
price
pay
given
for
the
option?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
will
be
money
down
the
drain
if
they
never
cancel
the
blanket
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
are
going
to
pay
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hruska,
i
hate
to
discontinue
the
interruption,
but
sometimes
the
theory
has
trouble
filtering
through
a
very,
very
long
brief
and
i
would
like
to
know
whether
your
price
fixing
theory
is
that
it
is
per
se
unlawful
to
have
two
competitors
to
use
a
common
sales
agent,
for
example,
automobile
companies
sometimes
use
the
same
too,
or
say
foreign
car
company
and
a
mexican
will
use
the
same
dealer.
under
your
theory,
is
that
per
se
unlawful?
or
alternatively,
is
it
your
theory
that
it
is
only
unlawful
when
it
is
a
substantial
portion
of
the
market,
for
example,
all
the
automobile
companies
using
a
common
sales
agent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
is
more
a
broker,
is
not
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
so
i
understood
your
theory,
then
your
theory
does
not
depend
on
the
percentage
of
the
market
that
the
principles
of
the
common
sales
agent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
again
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
you
if
the
analogy
really
is
fair,
the
50
oil
companies
do
not
sell
anything
that
no
one
company
could
sell,
but
in
this
case,
the
government
particularly
stresses
the
point
that
ascap
sells
a
product
that
no
one
composer
could
sell,
namely
the
blanket
license
and
that
the
blanket
license
has
independent
economic
utility.
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
here
is
a
benefit
to
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
you
would
rather
have
something
else,
but
i
do
not
think
you
can
deny
that
there
are
some
benefits
to
the
blanket
license.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
what
was
the
theory
of
the
suggestion
that
perhaps
per-use
licensing
might
survive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
that
the
record
does
not
indicate
at
all
why
was
that
the
broadcasters
did
not
want
to
deal
with
warners
in
the
episode?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
in
sort
of
digression
on
--
let
me
just
ask
you
this.
in
the
motion
picture
market
and
in
the
sync
rate
market,
where
i
understand
there
is
per-use
transactions
take
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
also
blanket
license
offered
in
those
markets?
