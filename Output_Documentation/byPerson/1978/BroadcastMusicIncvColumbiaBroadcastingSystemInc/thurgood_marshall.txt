the
man
that
has
copyrights
to

protected
them.

mean
how
could
he
negotiate
with

marshall
how
himself
can
happen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
person
who
has
got
three
songs

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
said
he
can
protect
himself,
i
want
to
know
how
in
the
world
he
could.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
and
he
go
to
sell
it
to
cbs,
get
cbs

can
he
do
that?
how
could
he
tell

let
us
say
he
lives
in
hawaii,
how
he
can
he
be
sure
that
he
was
being
paid
without
ascap?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
not
the
real
problem
is
this
is
all
set
up
long
before
the
broadcasting
industry?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now

trying
to
bring
them
both
together
