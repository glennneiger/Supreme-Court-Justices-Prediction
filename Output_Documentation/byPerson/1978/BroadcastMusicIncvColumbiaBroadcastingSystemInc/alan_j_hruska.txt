mr.
alan
j.
hruska
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
cbs,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
and
the
respondent
on
this
appeal.
the
principal
issue
on
this
appeal
is
the
correctness
of
the
court
of
appeals'
determination
that
defendant's
fixed
prices
or
more
specifically,
whether
a
combination
of
otherwise
competing
music
publishing
corporations
are
fixing
prices
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
when
the
prices
at
which
they
sell
music
performance
rights
for
television
network
use
are
not
determined
by
a
process
of
price
competition
but
are
determined
set
by
the
combination
itself
and
are
indeed
annual
single
package
prices
to
approve
of
all
the
members'
copyrights.
by
law,
copyrights
on
original
musical
compositions
are
granted
to
the
composers
of
those
compositions.
as
a
matter
of
practice,
those
copyrights
are
sold
to
the
music
publishing
corporations
and
the
licensing
of
music
rights
to
motion
picture
producers
to
the
makers
of
phonograph
records
and
to
the
publishers
of
sheet
music.
music
publishing
corporations
do
deal
directly
with
those
users
and
do
engage
in
price
competition.
and
the
licensing
of
performance
rights
for
television
network
use
such
as
cbs
music
publishing
corporations
manage
to
sell
in
a
thoroughly
noncompetitive
way
as
in
so
far
as
price
is
concerned.
how
do
they
do
that?
by
a
formally
structured,
controlled
and
pervasive
system
than
any
ordinary
price
fixing
arrangement.
in
the
routine
price
fixing
case,
it
is
common
to
find
that
the
sellers
have
gotten
together
not
uncommonly
in
a
hotel
room
and
it
either
by
explicit
agreement
or
by
some
well
placed
words
and
some
winks
and
may
be
some
nuts
have
agreed
to
set
price
at
may
be
a
$1,000
a
unit.
quite
really,
will
any
of
those
sellers
leaving
that
room
actually
sell
at
a
$1,000
a
unit?
they
will
negotiate
down
from
that
price
but
it
will
be
a
focal
point
for
negotiations
and
such
an
arrangement
is
obviously
illegal
per
se.
here,
the
music
publishing
corporations
do
not
agree
to
sell
individually
at
a
$1,000
a
use.
they
agree
to
have
a
central
instrumentality,
a
joint
sales
agency
ascap
or
bmi,
sell
a
blanket
license
to
their
entire
pool
of
copyrights
at
‘x'
million
dollars
a
year
and
then
to
distribute
$1,000
to
themselves
in
respective
each
use
the
licensee
makes
of
their
music.
now,
this
quite
obviously
is
a
very
effective
means
of
eliminating
price
competition
among
otherwise
competing
sellers
of
removing
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
yes
it
was.
we
have
charged
in
this
case,
price-fixing,
tie-in
and
monopolization.
we
definitely
did
try
a
monopolization
case.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
yes
indeed,
they
did.
the
district
court
ruled
that
ascap
and
bmi
were
not
monopolies
because
they
were
not
the
sole
source
of
supply
of
the
music
and
their
approvals.
that
ruling
we
claim
was
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
monopolies
need
not
be
the
sole
source
of
supply
monopoly
as
measured
by
the
handicap
that
the
monopolies
can
impost
and
the
handicap
here
as
i
will
get
you
in
a
few
moments,
it
is
quite
significant
based
on
the
district
court's
own
findings.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
the
court
of
appeals
appalled
that
finding,
excuse
me,
appalled
that
ruling
of
law.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
we
are
indeed.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well
i
think
under
existing
law
that
is
price
fixing.
however,
i
should
make
this
point.
i
think
that
it
is
certainly
a
more
difficult
question.
when
you
get
to
two
individual
entities,
otherwise
competing
entities,
which
if
they
were
to
merge,
would
clearly
not
violate
section
2,
and
nevertheless
are
fixing
prices.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
i
think
that
we
can
be
far
more
confidant
that
the
benefits
for
which
we
permit
mergers
to
occur
will
actually
be
achieved
when
the
firms
decide
to
merge.
on
the
other
hand,
when
the
firms
decide
not
to
merge
but
to
fix
prices
and
then
to
throw
some
integration
into
that
process,
then
we
can
be
far
less
comfortable,
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
two
little
firms.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
completely
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
which
observation
you
are
referring
to?
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
yes
the
logic
would
extend
to
not
to
form
a
partnership,
no,
but
to
enter
into
a
price
fixing
arrangement
on
the
bidding
for
a
particular
job,
then
perhaps,
yes.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
although
the
logic
--
but
i
have
got
to
complete
my
answer
to
that,
i
really
have
to
make
this
additional
point.
although
the
logic
would
extend
to
that,
it
is
not
necessarily
so
the
law
must
extend
to
that.
the
law
had
--
there
has
been
no
case
in
this
court
which
has
so
ruled
number
1.
number
2,
we
of
course
in
this
case
are
dealing
with
a
total
industry
of
otherwise
competing
sellers,
we
are
not
talking
about
two
little
firms,
we
are
talking
about
all
otherwise
competing
music
publishing
corporations
in
this
industry.
now,
if
you
are
--
obviously
if
those
people
would
sit
down
in
a
hotel
room
and
fix
prices
at
$1,000
a
unit,
that
will
be
a
clear
cut
case.
what
they
have
done
is
far
more
effective
than
that.
they
have
created
a
central
instrumentality
which
has
control
over
that
price,
which
ensures
that
price.
now,
if
there
is
anything
anomalous
in
the
antitrust
laws,
it
would
be
to
on
the
one
hand
prohibit
a
darn
variety
hotel
room
fix,
with
no
centralized
control,
with
cheating
all
over
the
place,
as
is
common
in
routine
price
fixing
cases.
and
on
the
other
hand,
permit
the
same
sellers
to
do
it
the
most
efficient
way,
to
take
price
completely
out
of
the
harsh
realities
of
a
competitive
marketplace.
if
the
steel
companies
were
doing
this,
if
the
steel
companies
turned
all
their
steel
over
to
a
joint
sales
agency,
the
american
iron
and
steel
institute,
has
then
have
that
institute
sell
their
steel
at
a
$1,000
a
ton,
a
defense
of
that
case
will
be
left
at
a
court.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
if
they
merged
obviously
under
existing
law
that
is
basic
distinction
we
make,
we
test
that
under
section
2
or
section
7
and
we
do
that
because
we
perceive
certain
benefits
commonly
achieved
in
monopolization
cases
and
we
perceive
the
antitrust
tools
section
2
and
7
adequately
to
judge
whether
those
benefits
outweigh
the
added
competitive
effects.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
yeah.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
no,
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
i
am
defending
the
result
i
got
in
the
second
circuit
on
pricing
fixing,
yes.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
i
certainly
would
like
to
enjoin
and
ask
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
no,
i
prefer
to
enjoin
blanket
licensing,
so
does
my
client.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
the
adoption
of
per-use
system.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
we
accept
that
we
do
not
prefer,
we
accept
it.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
yes,
i
am
quite
prepared
to
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
under
my
theory,
if
the
defendants
did
it
themselves,
it
would
be
illegal.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
in
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
case,
that
happens
to
be
sensible
and
to
bring
relief,
like
the
relief
granted
in
national
lead
and
heseltine
and
all
the
other
cases
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
if
that
is
both
sides,
then
i
am,
but
i
should
say
that
compulsory
licensing
on
reasonable
royalty
turns
has
been
granted
in
patent
cases,
in
the
national
lead
case,
in
the
heseltine
case
and
a
flock
of
others,
it
could
be
directed
to
the
individual
music
publishing
corporations
rather
than
ascap
and
bmi
and
form,
i
do
not
think
that
makes
much
difference.
the
per-use
system
is
an
interim
measure,
naturally
by
--
inherently
it
is
going
to
be
an
interim
measure
and
that
is
so
because
the
very
process
of
per-use
licensing
is
going
to
breakdown
the
barriers
of
direct
licensing
that
i
will
get
to
in
a
few
moments.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
it
certainly
our
position
that
when
a
substantial
portion
of
the
market
uses
a
common
sales
agent,
it
is
per
se
unlawful.
and
it
is
not
our
case
because
we
have
not
only
substantial
portion
of
market,
we
have
the
entire
market
involved
in
this
case.
but
it
is
also
a
theory
to
be
consistent
with
our
theory,
that
if
several
or
two
otherwise
competing
sellers,
use
a
common
sales
agent
that
in
almost
all
circumstances
that
i
can
conceive
up,
that
should
be
unlawful
per
se.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
it
is
very
difficult
to
conceive
of
the
situation
in
which
those
two
companies,
let
us
take
the
worst
case
in
my
standpoint,
those
two
companies
in
order
to
achieve
whatever
integration
benefits
they
are
trying
to
achieve
with
their
joint
sales
agency
really
have
to
fix
the
price
we
have
in
this
market
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
if
they
do
not
have
to
fix
the
price,
the
harry
fox
agency
for
example,
which
handles
on
behalf
of
music
publishing
corporations,
which
handles
the
licensing
of
mechanical
rights
and
right
through
motion
performance
rights
and
sync
rights
for
motion
picture
producers,
does
not
fix
the
price.
they
get
individual
quotes
from
each
music
publication
corporation.
now,
you
can
run
a
common
sales
agency
that
way.
there
is
nothing
against
it.
in
other
words,
each
time
the
common
sale
agent
wants
to
sell
the
goods
of
one
of
the
members
of
this
joint
venture;
he
simply
calls
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
not
necessarily.
no,
he
is
--
the
harry
fox
agency
does
not
consider
itself
a
broker.
they
say
they
testified
in
this
case,
they
consider
themselves
sales
agents
for
the
music
publishing
corporation.
the
harry
fox
agency
is
a
subsidiary
of
the
national
music
publishers'
association;
it
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
that
trade
association.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
true,
it
does
not
depend
on
the
percentage
of
the
market.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
that
is
right,
as
long
as
he
is
fixing
the
price
for
his
members
in
essence
or
his
clients
or
his
customers.
now
on
the
other
hand,
a
ruling
in
this
case
does
not
necessarily
have
to
decide
that
question,
because
as
that
keeps
coming
back
to,
we
are
not
dealing
with
two
little
companies
in
a
very
large
market,
we
are
dealing
with
all
the
companies
in
the
market.
now,
the
ascap
defendant
say,
we
had
a
consent
decree.
when
you,
the
television
networks
were
formed
and
took
your
first
license
in
1946,
ascap's
right
to
license
or
approval
was
effectively
exclusive
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
but
in
1950
that
piece
of
paper
that
consent
decree
was
changed.
now
that
piece
of
paper
makes
ascap's
right
to
license
nonexclusive.
well,
that
is
very
interesting
one
might
say,
but
has
anything
in
fact
change
for
29
years
as
a
result
of
order
in
that
one
word
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
the
clear
answer
to
that
is
no,
nothing
has
changed.
are
you
still
selling
your
performance
rights
at
prices
fixed
by
the
ascap
board
as
you
have
done
for
65
years,
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
and
is
that
piece
of
paper
somehow
unfix
the
prices
that
which
you
are
actually
selling
through
ascap,
and
answer
to
that
is
no
and
do
not
the
conspirators
in
an
ordinarily
price
fixing
arrangement
also
have
the
right
to
sell
it
individually
negotiated
prices
in
view
of
the
fact
that
pricing
fixing
arrangements
are
unenforceable,
of
course
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
and
are
the
case
books
filled
with
successful
price
fixing
prosecutions
of
people
involved
in
the
fix
who
frequently
departed
from
the
fixed
price,
and
of
course
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
and
but
ascap
says,
you
cbs
should
ask,
you
should
ask
the
music
publishing
corporations
to
engage
in
individual
negotiations,
why?
does
any
customer
of
a
price
fixing
consortium
have
any
obligation
in
law,
that
ask
the
conspirators
to
plea
stop
fixing
prices
to
himself
and
all
the
other
customers
in
the
market
as
a
pre-condition
for
enjoining
the
fix,
certainly
not.
the
fact
that
otherwise
repeating
sellers
are
selling
at
agreed
upon
prices
is
enough.
if
ten
major
oil
companies
fix
prices
at
$1000
a
barrel,
could
there
be
any
doubt
at
all
that
a
single
buyer
of
oil
who
had
refused
to
deal
with
those
ten
companies
precisely
because
of
the
fix
and
had
dealt
with
non-conspirators,
any
doubt
at
all
that,
that
company
could
enjoin
the
fix
or
let
us
suppose
that
there
is
ten
major
oil
companies
decide
to
fix
prices
to
the
50
largest
customers.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
i
do
not
see
why
not.
the
policing
aspect
of
this
case
is
utterly
meaningless.
music
publishing
corporations
can
police
or
they
can
police
jointly,
but
they
do
not
have
to
fix
prices
in
order
to
police.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
i
think
under
the
aiken
decision,
the
new
copyright
statute,
doctors'
offices
are
not
infringing
on
copyrights,
but
you
do
not
know,
today's
world
anybody
who
wants
to
buy
a
phonograph
and
a
phonograph
record,
whether
he
is
running
a
barbershop
or
a
hotel
or
doctors'
office,
can
set
that
record
player
up
and
start
playing
music,
as
i
said,
i
do
not
think
it
is
an
infringement,
but
the
policing
aspect
of
this
is
really
a
separate
thing.
publishers
who
police
together
do
not
have
to
fix
prices
together,
they
do
not
have
to
sell
together.
there
is
really
no
necessary
connection.
the
connection
comes
about
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
when
they
do
so
collectively,
then
of
course
they
got
to
have
a
vast
monitoring
system
to
keep
taps
on
everybody's
uses
so
they
can
take
that
big
lump
sum
figure
they
get
from
the
users
and
distribute
it
in
this
managed
market
way
to
their
members.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
no,
no,
i
want
to
deal
with
the
questions.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
that
may
well
have
been
and
no
doubt
that
was
one
of
the
inspiring
reasons
for
the
creation
of
an
organization
like
ascap,
but
as
a
matter
of
logic
and
as
a
matter
of
plain
economic
fact
in
which
no
one
really
disagrees
about,
to
in
order
for
publishers
to
police
together
or
monitor
users'
uses
together,
they
do
not
have
to
fix
prices.
for
example,
if
they
were
to
get
out
of
a
television
network
market,
just
get
out
of
the
cartel,
ascap
and
bmi
so
that
licensing
could
proceed
on
a
direct
basis.
if
they
wanted
to
monitor
the
uses
of
the
cbs
television
network
and
if
they
wanted
to
do
it
jointly
and
indeed
if
they
wanted
to
do
it
through
ascap
and
bmi,
that
is
fine,
they
can
do
that.
monitoring
consists
of
nothing
more
than
getting
reports
from
the
networks
as
to
what
is
being
used,
turning
your
sound
audio,
taping
equipment
on
the
networks
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
his
music
publishing
corporation
protects
him
now.
we
do
not
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
if
in
the
dealings
that
his
music
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
if
he
has
not
got
a
music
publishing
corporation
now,
because
as
i
say,
it
is
a
matter
of
commercial
practice
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
he
is
got
to
have
somebody,
he
can
have
himself,
he
can
have
a
publisher.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
it
is
not
a
question
of
competing
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
the
people
who
supply
music
now,
who
write
music
originally
for
television
network
use,
deal
of
course
with
the
program
packages.
cbs
as
i
am
sure
you
understand
produces
very
few
of
its
own
programs.
they
deal
with
the
program
packagers
and
they
do
very
well.
they
get
between
1,000
and
$2,500
a
week
for
orchestrating,
composing
the
music,
orchestrating
the
music
and
directing.
they
deal
for
everything
but
for
music
performance
right,
that
is
covered
by
the
ascap
like
license.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
there
are
really
two
different
questions.
one
is
if
they
use
the
music,
how
can
he
would
be
sure
that
he
will
detect
such
a
use?
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
yes,
it
was
set
up.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
no,
i
am
trying
to
take
them
apart.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
yeah.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
yeah.
i
was
up
to
the
point
your
honor
was
i
was
positing
the
situation
of
major
oil
companies
conspiring
to
fix
prices
to
their
50
largest
customers
and
suggesting
that
the
50
first
customer
would
plainly
have
a
right
to
obtain
an
injunction
against
that
price
fix
because
the
conspiracy
would
obviously
pollute
the
market
in
which
their
customers
are
attempting
to
buy,
so
that
if
cbs
would
drop
its
ascap
market
license
and
attempt
to
bypass
and
ascap,
cbs,
like
the
51st
customer
of
oil,
would
certainly
have
the
right
to
enjoin
the
price
fixing
that
was
still
going
on
directly
in
sales
to
abc
and
nbc,
even
though
cbs
has
stopped
dealing
with
the
cartel.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
absent
conspiracy,
twentieth
century
fox
cannot
market
the
films
made
by
mgm
and
united
artists
and
columbia
pictures
and
all
the
other
motion
picture
companies,
but
that
is
not
excuse
for
price
fixing,
that
is
a
definition
of
price
fixing.
now,
the
department's
point
is
literally
based
on
several
“benefits”
that
the
department
believes
it
perceives
in
this
situation
and
those
benefits
are
illusory.
those
are
things
that
we
do
not
need.
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
when
those
benefits
are
sided
to
us,
it
is
a
fixed
price
in
a
fancy
bottle.
the
benefits
consist
of
immediate
access
to
songs
as
soon
they
are
written,
that
is
very
nice
and
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
but
it
is
totally
unnecessary
if
we
have
got
to
choose
between
getting
a
competitive
price
and
getting
a
fixed
price
in
this
particular
fancy
model.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
they
are
not
appreciable,
they
are
not
significant
and
they
are
not
justifications
of
price
fixing.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor,
because
oil
companies
can
create
benefits
too.
any
cartel
of
sellers
can
manufacture
benefits
if
they
cartelize
their
sales.
for
example
in
some
industries,
you
could
have
a
situation
where
50
sellers
would
simply
fire
most
of
their
salesmen,
they
did
not
achieve
transactional
efficiencies,
they
would
be
able
to
do
so
because
they
had
a
common
sales
agency.
we
are
going
to
permit
price
fixing
to
go
on
because
that
happens
that
is
a
benefit,
but
it
certainly
not
a
benefit
justifying
price
fixing.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
no.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
but
they
make
it
frangible
by
selling
your
blanket
license,
but
it
is
not
naturally
or
inherently
a
frangible
product.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
on
the
contrary,
a
great
deal
of
investment
is
engaged
in
by
the
independent
packager
of
each
of
these
programs
and
simply
the
selection
of
the
music
for
his
program.
so
what
is
not
frangible
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
district
court
did
find
that
copyrights
in
various
classes
reasonably
unchangeable
that
they
compete
with
each
other,
so
we
are
not
dealing
with
non-competitive
products,
we
are
certainly
dealing
with
copyrights
that
compete
with
each
other
when
they
are
being
pervade
to
motion
picture
producers.
indeed
one
of
the
ironies
here
is
that
some
of
the
motion
picture
producers
are
the
very
people
who
are
making
television
programs.
and
when
they
deal
in
motion
pictures,
when
they
are
making
motion
pictures
in
their
studios,
they
are
getting
competitive
prices
on
music.
when
they
are
making
television
programs
in
their
studios,
they
are
not.
we
have
the
market
as
i
say
cartelize,
but
i
would
like
to
inject
some
further
reality
into
this
situation.
the
reality
is
in
purpose
in
effect
in
the
first
place,
we
got
to
look
at
who
the
music
publishing
corporations
that
populate
the
ascap
board
year
after
year
or
who
are
they
that
accept
these
blanket
licensing
fees,
they
are
warner
brothers
and
they
are
twentieth
century
fox
and
they
are
mca
universal
and
paramount,
which
as
all
we
know
subsidiary
of
gulf
and
western
united
artists,
subsidiary
of
transamerica
and
chappell
music
and
sherman
music,
a
pair
of
(inaudible)
like
a
hardcore
of
the
old
line
music
publishing
corporations
which
control
the
standard
compositions
that
are
used
often
on
television
networks.
in
other
words,
we
are
dealing
here
with
economic
pigmies
on
the
other
side.
and
is
there
any
doubt
at
all
about
their
purpose
in
maintaining
the
system.
the
purpose
of
this
combination
that
it
is
to
maintain
prices,
i
submit
that
there
is
not
at
all.
the
very
counterclaim
in
this
case
flatly
states
that
cbs
has
attempted
to
enjoin
the
blanket
licensing
system
is
part
of
plan
designed
to
press
the
price
paid
for
music
performance
rights
and
if
their
purpose
in
opposing
the
elimination
of
the
blanket
licensing
system
is
to
avoid
a
depression
of
the
price.
their
purpose
in
maintaining
the
blanket
licensing
system
is
obviously
to
maintain
the
price.
in
other
words,
this
argument
by
the
ascap
defendants
is
subsequently
identical
to
the
argument
made
by
the
society
of
professional
engineers
that
competitive
bidding
would
pressure
price
reductions.
it
is
as
clear
an
admission
of
any
competitive
purpose
as
one
could
possibly
fine
and
it
is
far
familiar
one.
we
have
cited
rather
large
collection
in
our
brief,
such
as
the
speech
given
by
ascap's
president
some
years
ago
that
the
central
purpose
of
ascap
and
the
writers
guild
and
similar
organizations
was
to
resist
the
splitting
of
all
rights
so
that
we
could
be
picked
of
one
by
one,
or
the
testimony
given
in
this
case
by
ascap's
board
member
and
officer
mr.
brettler,
who
is
also
the
head
of
shapiro
bernstein
publishing
company,
that
the
benefits
of
hiring
the
ascap
which
he
describe
as
a
legal
monopoly
where
that
in
unity
there
is
strength
and
added
disunity,
there
is
weakness.
and
the
record
is
filled
for
this.
and
just
as
reveling
our
defendant's
intention
to
maintain
prices
to
the
blanket
licensing
system
are
these
facts.
ascap
pays
out
to
its
members
on
a
per
use
basis.
ie,
it
pays
its
members
a
$1,000
for
every
future
use
of
their
music
on
the
television
network,
but
ascap
refuses
to
take
in
on
a
per
use
basis.
ie
refuses
to
charge
in
that
network
separately
for
each
use.
is
blanket
licensing
therefore
are
necessarily
restrictive
and
deliberately
so
and
is
deliberately
designed
to
preclude
price
competition,
of
course
it
is.
the
blanket
license
is
an
all
or
nothing
deal,
either
you
take
the
entire
pool
or
you
get
nothing.
that
means
if
you
take
the
entire
pool
that
direct
licensing
is
obviously
silly
because
then
he
was
going
to
pay
twice
from
the
same
user.
if
ascap
agree
to
take
in
on
a
per
use
basis
that
would
mean
that
the
program
packagers,
the
people
who
make
the
television
programs
and
sell
them
to
cbs
could
immediately
start
direct
licensing
for
the
preponderance
of
the
composition
they
use,
both
music
written
originally
for
television
by
their
own
staff
writers
and
publish
music
and
get
some
form
of
price
competition
going
at
once
and
so
can
cbs
for
relatively
few
programs
that
it
make
itself.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
yes,
right.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
they
did
not
say
that
exactly
your
honor,
no,
they
said
ascap
--
they
said
that
the
price
fixing,
the
antitrust
violation
was
going
on
might
be
relieved
by
the
per-use
system,
on
the
other
hand
i
recognize
that
the
per
use
system
might
have
a
continuing
effect
on
direct
licensing
prices,
they
were
not
persuaded
that,
that
was
so,
but
they
thought
it
might
be
so
and
they
suggested
the
district
court
that
this
be
tried
out,
but
the
whole
suggestion
there,
i
suggest
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
because
the
court
of
appeals
perceived
that
the
present
system
creates
a
substantial
disinclination,
otherwise
there
are
cartel
created
values
here
to
be
preserved
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
those
values
as
this
court
did
in
the
mason
case.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
oh
no,
on
the
contrary,
i
am
wholly
endorsing
that
theory,
in
fact
i
argued
that
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
yes.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
oh,
no
if
that
is
the
theory
you
mean
that
i
am
wholly
endorsing,
the
answer
is
i
accepted
i
do
endorse
it,
even
though
i
must
note
on
behalf
of
my
client
that
we
would
prefer
to
enjoin
the
system
entirely,
to
enjoin
blanket
licensing
for
television
networks.
and
the
reason
we
prefer
that
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
to
give
us
a
more
effective
remedy,
i
think
ultimately,
although
they
argument
otherwise.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
i
do
not
know
that
i
really
regarded
as
an
expansion.
i
think
if
you
think
in
term,
if
you
think
of
a
per-use
system,
a
little
hard
to
pursue,
really
interpret
how
to
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
no
mr.
justice
white,
i
have
not
made
myself
clear,
let
me
try
to
do
so
now.
i
think
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
and
i
hesitate
to
quantify
that
exactly,
but
a
relatively
short
period
of
time,
either
form
of
relief
is
going
to
end
up
at
the
same
place.
now,
the
reason
i
think
that
and
there
is
lots
in
the
record
to
support
this,
is
that
if
you
start
with
a
per-use
system,
that
means
ascap
will
be
–
that
music
will
be
available
from
ascap,
whatever
the
court
sets
as
a
price,
‘x
dollars'
a
use,
so
the
court
may
not
set
the
price
until
he
sees
what
the
prices
are
in
direct
licensing
transaction
and
gear
the
per-use
price
of
that.
but
whatever
that
price
is
set,
that
will
be
the
amount
of
money
for
which
per-use
you
can
get
music
from
ascap.
on
the
other
hand,
you
can
also
deal
directly
with
music
publishing
corporation.
now,
to
get
to
a
per-use
system,
obviously
there
must
be
a
declaration
in
this
case
(inaudible).
that
declaration
coupled
with
the
inauguration
of
the
per-use
system
is
going
to
renounce
the
music
publishing
world
as
it
must
that
blanket
licensing
is
over,
there
is
no
further
possibility
of
blanket
licensing.
they
will
have
no
choice
whatever,
let
me
sure
of
a
boycott,
they
will
have
no
choice
whatever
then
for
the
first
time
to
create
the
direct
licensing
facilities.
we
have
got
to
recognize
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
music
publishing
industry
that
lacks
the
personnel,
the
established
operating
procedures,
any
of
the
forms,
any
of
the
consents
they
are
going
to
have
to
have
from
their
writers
to
engage
in
direct
licensing,
none
of
that
is
in
existence,
none
of
that
is
in
place.
the
district
court
found,
excuse
me
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
yes,
the
district
court
found
that
with
all
period
advance
preparation,
which
you
read
at
particularize
the
page
107
of
the
record
and
i
make
a
note
of
that
page
because
that
is
a
very
important
page
to
resolve
a
dispute
that
seems
to
have
come
about
through
the
reply
briefs.
(inaudible)
that
he
found
that
from
the
time
that
cbs
announced
its
intention
to
engage
in
direct
licensing
and
he
also
said
that
there
would
be
inauguration
of
direct
licensing
facilities
until
cbs
made
that
announcement.
from
the
time
that
cbs
announced
to
the
time
that,
i
think
he
referred
to
it
as
well
all
machine,
it
would
be
in
place
that
would
permit
direct
licensing
to
occur,
would
be
at
least
a
year,
that
is
what
he
said.
now,
he
also
suggested
to
us,
a
lot
of
phrase
that
we
might
do
during
the
process
of
that
year,
we
might
require
the
movie
companies
who
make
our
programs
to
call
a
flop,
the
catalogs
and
their
music
publishing
subsidiaries
that
presumably
on
threat
that
their
production
services
would
not
be
agree
with
favor
by
cbs
unless
they
did
that,
he
suggest
we
go
out
and
get
many
blanket
licenses
which
are
probably
tieing
on
this
court's
decision
in
leibovitz
and
paramount.
he
suggested
we
do
a
lot
of
other
things.
now
i
suggest
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
this
sort
of
rigamarole
to
get
yourself
into
a
competitive
market,
is
really
far
worse
than
the
rigamarole
that
a
customer
for
engineering
services
have
to
go
through
in
that
professional
engineers
case.
after
we
recognize
that,
that
customer
if
he
wanted
to
nominate
one
engineer
and
get
his
price
and
then
resume
that
relationship
and
nominate
an
other
engineer
and
so
forth,
could
get
himself
access
eventually
into
a
competitive
market,
but
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
far
bigger
problem.
and
we
got
to
at
least
expend
all
these
efforts
and
takeover
these
risks
and
by
all
these
options,
which
your
honor
referred
to
before
and
all
economists
in
this
case
agree,
we
would
have
to
pay
for
those
options
and
pay
duly.
we
have
to
go
through
all
this
rigamarole
to
get
to
competitive
market.
and
i
just
do
not
think
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
required
in
it,
and
bear
in
mind
that
professional
engineers'
case
was
not
a
case
in
which
the
engineers
had
agreed
on
the
prices
that
they
would
sell.
here
is
a
case
in
which
otherwise
competing
sellers
are
agreeing
on
the
price
which
they
would
sell
and
there
is
no
possibility
if
we
went
through
this
rigamarole
and
if
we
did
pay
the
penalties
on
music
in
the
can.
there
is
no
possibility
we
would
get
a
competitive
price.
every
ascap
publisher
knows,
every
time
he
sees
a
piece
of
his
music
being
used
on
cbs
that
is
a
$1000
in
his
pocket.
if
we
abandon
all
ascap
license
and
if
we
try
to
license
directly,
the
first
place
he
is
going
to
start,
his
first
frame
of
reference
is
going
to
be
a
$1000
a
use.
we
have
plenty
of
testimony
in
this
case
about
that.
it
is
an
admitted
fact;
you
see
that
in
the
briefs.
asacap
is
saying
now
in
their
reply
brief,
well,
you
may
be
right,
what
so
wrong
with
that,
why
is
that
any
different
from
what
in
the
other
seller
in
ordinary
market
does,
takes
in
account
prior
prices.
but
here
we
are
talking
about
not
the
influence
of
the
sellers
own
prior
prices,
not
the
influence
of
competitive
market
prices,
we
are
talking
about
the
influence
of
a
consortium
price,
where
price
has
been
agreed
upon
and
that
is
different.
on
that
effect,
this
is
ineluctable.
now
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
not
persuaded
that,
that
effect
would
occur
and
i
suggest
that,
that
was
an
error
of
logic
and
economics.
this
was
an
admitted
point
by
economists
of
the
parties
themselves.
and
once
you
--
and
it
is
an
obvious
point,
and
once
you
have
get
a
stabilization
effect
like
that
injected
into
a
market,
it
does
not
go
away,
unless
you
can
reduce
the
price
to
zero
and
that
does
an
exist
outside
of
some
pathological
economic
text
book
model.
it
certainly
does
not
exist
in
the
motion
picture
filed
where
motion
picture
companies
are
paying
between
$750
and
$20,000
for
each
use.
bmi
makes
a
ceiling
price
argument
related
to
the
per-use
licenses,
which
could
not
possibly
be
have
any
effect
at
all,
if
the
music
prices
could
be
driven
down
to
zero.
the
district
court
made
a
finding
in
the
3m
incident
that
a
lot
of
publishers
refused
to
deal
because
the
money
was
not
high
enough.
and
remember,
who
are
dealing
within
the
other
side
of
this
bargaining
table.
we
are
not
dealing
as
i
said
before
with
economic
pigmies
and
it
is
not
even
cbs
is
going
to
be
buying
the
music,
it
is
going
to
be
the
independent
packagers
and
those
are
the
same
people
who
very
often
pay
2
or
5
or
$10,000
for
music
performance
rights
for
them
making
motion
pictures.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
the
warner
brothers
incident
occurred
in
the
30's,
it
was
radio
broadcasters.
i
do
not
think
the
record
is
--
i
do
not
think
anybody
was
around.
still
who
was
there
and
the
incident
except
for
one
music
publisher,
buddy
morris,
who
was
a
member
of
ascap
board
and
mr.
morris
said
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
warner
brothers
backed
down
and
backed
down
pretty
soon.
i
mean
this
thing
did
not
get
off
the
ground
really.
one
of
the
reasons
they
backed
down
was
because
the
writers
were
up
in
arms
and
why
were
the
writers
up
in
arms,
they
were
up
in
arms
because
of
what
they
perceived
to
be
warner
brothers
disloyalty
to
ascap.
now
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
music
writers,
yes,
they,
you
know,
song
writers
who
assigned
their
rights
to
warner
brothers
and
then
saw
warner
brothers
leave
the
family,
leave
the
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
the
composers,
yeah.
and
the
3m
incident,
well,
you
know,
we
do
not
really
attack
the
court's
finding
of
3m
except
for
the
medical
mistakes
the
court
made,
which
you
have
got
to
look
at
on
the
three
evidence
and
there
is
all
the
evidence
the
court
did
not
look
at.
and
27
out
of
35,
he
said
dealt,
well,
and
he
said
eight
did
not
deal,
and
even
that
is
wrong,
it
was
nine
that
refused
to
deal,
not
eight.
and
when
you
compare
the
publishers
who
refused
to
deal,
the
nine,
who
by
ascap's
credit
system
account
for
40%
of
cbs
users
and
i
say
ascap's
credit
system,
you
can
evaluate
music
in
terms
of
equal
numbers
of
compositions
because
some
music
is
more
liable
than
other
music
and
the
credit
system
of
ascap
does
that,
so
that
is
probably
the
best
way
we
have
right
now
of
evaluating
uses
the
nine
who
refused
to
deal
supply
40%
of
cbs's
uses.
the
27
or
26,
whatever
the
number
was,
who
did
deal
are
at
the
minimis
percentage,
the
total
of
them
was
3.5%.
when
you
take
out
three
of
them,
which
i
will
comeback
to
in
a
moment,
you
get
down
to
less
than
1%.
the
three
big
ones
who
dealt
were
jewel
music
and
the
president
of
jewel
music
testified
in
this
case
and
he
said
he
would
not
do
it
again,
he
made
a
bad
mistake,
this
is
in
out
addendum
a,
he
said
that
what
ascap
is
licensing
a
category
of
users,
he
believes
that
music
publishing
corporation
should
not,
this
was
jewel
music.
and
then
we
had
two
other
big
publishers,
shapiro
bernstein
and
mca.
the
president
of
the
mca
almost
lost
his
job
over
this
sort
of
thing.
it
was
so
embarrassing
that
the
attorney
for
3m
had
offered
a
contract
and
the
publisher
who
was
the
head
of
shapiro
bernstein,
who
licensed
said
that
the
comparison
between
licensing
this
in
this
trivial
way,
which
was
sound
money
an
absolute
windfall,
and
from
his
standpoint,
he
expected
to
get
as
much
as
$500,000
from
the
licensing
and
licensing
a
television
network
where
that
was
grains
compared
to
watermelons.
he
made
a
speech
at
the
ascap
board
which
said,
you
know,
if
we
license
these
people
3m
and
get
this
thing
off
the
ground,
they
are
going
to
have
to
comeback
to
ascap
anyway,
that
is
how
he
justified.
i
did
not
really
want
to
hang
up
on
the
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
yes.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice
stevens,
no.
and
the
sync
right
and
performance
right
is
licensed
in
one
transaction
and
the
license
use
at
a
time,
that
is
a
sensible
way
to
license
music.
i
think
in
the
short
time
i
have
remaining,
i
would
like
to
jump
to
the
rule
of
reason
point
and
mainly
to
make
the
point
that
the
court
of
appeals
really
decided
this
case
on
rule
of
reason
grounds
as
well
as
per
se
grounds,
that
is
not
the
label
that
the
court
used,
but
that
is
obviously
what
it
did
and
in
addition
to
holding
this
former
price
fixing
to
be
per
se
illegal.
the
court
of
appeals
looked
to
see
whether
this
price
fixing
was
necessary
for
any
market
functioning
purpose
and
found
that
it
was
not.
the
court
of
appeals
looked
to
see
whether
the
system
created
a
disinclination
to
compete
and
found
that
it
did
inevitability.
the
court
of
appeals
looked
to
see
whether
there
was
a
less
restrictive
alternative
and
found
that
there
was,
the
per-use
system.
and
all
of
these
were
rule
of
reason
determinations.
and
this
was
obviously
the
basis
of
judge
morris
concurrence,
which
defendants
suggest
was
irrational.
moreover,
there
is
nothing
of
cognizable
economic
value
that
this
unnecessarily
restrictive
system
can
be
said
to
provide
that
would
not
be
better
provided
by
a
competitive
market.
all
we
have
really
heard
and
it
is
not
really
a
rule
of
reason
consideration
is
that
cbs
is
too
big,
to
be
permitted
to
deal
one-on-one
with
aarom
copland
or
george
gershwin
or
the
write
of
several
songs,
but
cbs
will
not
be
dealing
with
aarom
copland
even
to
the
limited
extend
cbs
is
producing
its
own
programs.
the
independent
packagers
will
be
dealing
with
them
as
they
now
deal
with
authors
and
actors
and
scenery
designers
and
set
designers
and
everybody
else,
who
supplies
elements
for
television
program
except
ascap
supplied
music.
and
as
i
said
before,
the
people
who
write
music
for
television
get
between
a
$1,000
and
$
2,500
a
week,
so
there
is
plenty
of
those
people
who
have
adequate
bargaining
card.
i
guess
the
last
point
i
want
to
turn
to
is
defendant's
expressed
concern
in
their
brief
for
troubled
damage
liability
if
this
judgment
is
affirmed,
that
to
obviously
is
something
to
do
with
the
rule
of
reason
determination,
but
it
should
be
--
but
i
think
also
it
has
not
very
little
to
do
with
this
lawsuit.
cbs
has
not
saw
damages
in
this
case,
troubled
or
otherwise.
the
television
stations
are
recently
sued
in
new
york
and
they
have
not
saw
damages
either.
and
if
any
group
of
users
sue
and
if
they
do
seek
damages
and
this
court
believes
for
any
reason
that
these
music
publishing
corporation
should
not
pay
damages,
this
court
has
the
inherent
powers
to
decide.
so
this
case
will
not
decide
the
question
of
whether
music
publishing
corporations
must
pay
damages,
what
it
should
decide
i
submit
is
that
price
fixing
is
unlawful
whether
committed
or
something
as
beloved
as
a
popular
tune
or
on
any
other
right
commodity
or
service.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
i
am
suggesting
that
the
court
has
discretion
not
to
award
damages
under
the
law,
even
though
there
is
liability,
any
damages.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
exactly,
yes
your
honor,
i
am
suggesting.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
i
think
it
is
nice
question
and
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
you
can
argue
it
both
ways
and
i
--
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
it
just
never
been
decided
and
if
i
had
to
run
a
brief
on
that,
i
would
say,
if
you
are
going
to
award
damages,
there
are
going
to
trouble
under
the
statute.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
well,
it
apparently
did.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
from
the
sense
in
all
case
in
which
this
court
stated
exactly
that
your
honor.
mr.
alan
j.
hruska
yes.
