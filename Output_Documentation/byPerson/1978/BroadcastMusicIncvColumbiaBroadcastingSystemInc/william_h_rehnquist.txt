h.
rehnquist
miss
kearse,
there
is
nothing
in
the
composer's
contract
with
ascap
and
they
would
prevent
them
dealing
directly
with
cbs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
factual
question
is
covered
by
the
findings
of
the
district
court
with
respect
to
ascap?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
how
ascap
goes
about
policing,
do
they
send
patients
to
the
doctors'
offices?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
easterbrook,
you
are
here
i
take
it
as
a
lawyer
and
not
as
a
qualified
expert
testifying
before
nisi
prius
court
as
to
the
licensing
of
music
and
what
its
competitive
effects
are?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hruska,
what
is
your
answer
to
the
petitioner's
contention
that
if
you
have
two
individual
general
contractors
that
go
into
partnership,
they
sees
competing
too
and
bid
as
a
unit
rather
than
formally
is
they
then
supplying
two
separate
prices.
this
was
not
tried
under
a
monopolization
theory,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
rule
on
your
monopolization?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
do
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
you
are
challenging
the
two
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
the
question
about
the
two
general
contractors
who
form
a
partnership
and
from
then
on
did
singly
rather
than
separately.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
mean
judge
taft
was
wrong
in
his
expression
of
views
in
the
addyston
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
have
the
same
difficulty
with
your
answer
that
my
brother
stevens
did
with
one
of
mr.
easterbrook's
answers,
is
that
an
answer
to
my
question,
do
you
agree
or
do
you
not
agree
with
judge
taft's
observation
in
the
addyston
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
observation
that
if
you
applied
the
logic
of
your,
i
won't
say
your
principle,
but
this
principle
towards
extended
to
â€“
it
would
extend
to
two
individual
businessmen
who
form
a
partnership.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
two
relatively
minor
steel
companies
merge
and
from
then
on,
they
had
a
common
sales
agent
who
quoted
a
single
price?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hruska,
i
understand
that
you
would
like
to
stay
on
both
sides
of
this
question
because
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
entirely
fair
mr.
hruska
to
analogies
this
case
or
you
dealing
with
copyrights
which
have
to
be
policed
in
order
to
be
enforced
with
barrels
of
oil?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
some
organization,
each
individual
music
publishing
house
would
have
great
difficulty
policing
doctor's
offices
and
muzak
places
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
my
understanding
that
the
reason
that
they
had
the
blanket
license
with
that
even
though
they
all
are
banded
together
for
the
purpose
of
policing.
even
though
the
large
joint
organizations
ascap,
i
am
sorry
if
i
am
interrupting
your
schedule
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ascap
or
bmi
were
incapable
of
policing
individual
users,
then
therefore
the
blanket
license.
