it
is
not
percentage
of
gross
receipts
or
anything
like
that,
it
is
a
fixed
dollar
amount.
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
money?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
makes
sure
that
the
feature
music
was
small
and
percentage
but
extremely
significant?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
easterbrook,
you
have
repeatedly
referred
to
ascap,
you
might
understand
that
you
mean
generically
to
also
include
bmi?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
easterbrook,
part
of
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
reminded
me
of,
cbs's
argument
with
respect
to
music
that
is
already
in
the
can
as
it
is
called
recorded
and
the
fact
that
with
respect
to
that,
they
would
not
and
could
not
be
free
negotiation
for
the
same
reason
that
you
indicated
in
part
of
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
that
ladder
that
suggests
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
kind
of
license
would
cover
music
in
the
can?
justice
potter
stewart
lyric
writers
or
music
writers?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
has
no
discretion,
if
it
awards
damages
to
say
well,
in
this
case,
it
will
be
single
damages
or
double
damages
or
one-and-half
times
or
one-and-three
times
or
just
actually
damages,
does
it?
that
was
suggested
in
city
of
lafayette,
i
think?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
if
there
is
a
pretty
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
topkis.
justice
potter
stewart
your
opponent
about
the
motion
picture
market
and
the
sync
right
market,
and
he
said
there
were
no
blanket
licenses
in
those
markets.
and
i
guess
is
that
correct
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
if
so,
i
wonder
why
not
if
they
have
the
economic
utility?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
sync
right
market
also
applies
to
television
network.
justice
potter
stewart
the
television
sync
rights
then.
justice
potter
stewart
because
they
are
so
infrequent?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
correct,
there
are
no
blanket
licensees
in
that
market,
or
in
the
motion
picture
market?
justice
potter
stewart
thus
would
you
give
the
same
answers
to
the
reason
for
no
blanket
license
in
the
motion
picture
market
that
they
are
so
rare,
do
you
think
they
are
used
rarely
for
the
movies?
justice
potter
stewart
is
bmi
also
enjoined?
