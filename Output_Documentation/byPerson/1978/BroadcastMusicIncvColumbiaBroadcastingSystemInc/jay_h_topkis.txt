mr.
jay
h.
topkis
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
before
the
court
representing
the
american
society
of
composers,
authors
and
publishers
and
various
of
its
writer
and
publisher
defendants
who
were
sued
by
cbs
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
some
eight
years
ago.
with
me
are
miss
amalya
kearse,
who
will
be
speaking
for
broadcast
music,
incorporated
and
its
various
affiliated
defendants
and
the
honorable
frank
easterbrook,
deputy
solicitor
general,
who
will
present
the
government’s
views.
miss
kearse,
mr.
easterbrook
and
i
each
have
15
minutes
allotted
to
us.
and
from
my
part,
i
propose
to
endeavor
to
present
my
initial
presentation
in
about
ten
minutes
reserving
some
five
for
rebuttal
if
time
permits.
now
as
the
court
knows,
this
case
is
here
pursuant
to
the
grant
of
writ
of
a
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
cbs
having
sued
ascap
and
its
various
member
defendants
in
bmi
and
its
various
affiliated
defendants
under
the
antitrust
laws
in
late
1969.
the
issue
was
quite
simple
then
and
it
remains
quite
simple
today.
cbs
claim
that
its
television
network
needed
to
broadcast
a
good
deal
of
copyrighted
music
and
but
it
could
not
obtain
the
licenses
for
those
copyrights
in
direct
negotiations
with
the
copyright
proprietors.
therefore
said
cbs
in
its
complaint
it
was
compelled
to
take
a
blanket
license
from
ascap
and
also
from
bmi.
a
blanket
license
as
i
think
the
court
is
aware
is
one
under
which
the
user,
the
licensee
has
the
right
to
use
any
or
all
of
the
compositions
owned
by
all
members
of
ascap
and
we
have
over
22,000
today
and
all
of
the
more
than
30
affiliated
foreign
societies
around
the
world
on
whose
behalf
we
license
copyrights
as
often
whenever
with
whatever
frequency
the
user
wishes
and
the
user
pays
just
one
stipulated
fee.
for
a
television
network
like
cbs
i
may
say
that
fee
has
been
running
well
under
1%
of
the
gross
receipts
from
sponsors
with
the
network
experiences.
the
compulsion
of
which
it
claimed
–
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
no
your
honor,
in
the
licenses
which
we
used
as
of
1969,
it
was
a
percentage,
we
thereafter
with
nbc
and
abc
went
to
stipulated
dollar
amounts.
with
cbs,
we
have
not
had
a
license
since
69.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
nbc
has
something
over
$4
million
a
year,
abc
something
less
than
that
abc
since
come
on
rather
strong
but
they
got
us
when
they
were
weak.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
the
cbs
your
honor
had
settled
with
us
in
1969
for
five
years
as
i
recall
it
leading
up
to
69
and
the
average
for
those,
it
was
one
lump
sum,
sums
were
allocated
to
each
of
the
years
but
the
parties
agree
that,
that
would
not
be
referred
to
in
any
court
proceedings
so
i
prefer
not
to
say
that
but
the
average
was
something
over
$4
million
a
year
for
cbs
also.
now,
the
compulsion
of
which
it
complained
said
cbs
violated
the
antitrust
laws
and
all
the
usual
ways
we
were
accused
of
everything,
block-booking,
tying,
price
fixing,
monopolization
section
1,
section
2,
and
the
compulsions
sprangs
at
cbs
from
two
sources.
first,
cbs
complained
that
although
it
had
never
approached
so
much
as
one
member
of
ascap
seeking
a
direct
license,
cbs
was
sure
that
ascap’s
members
if
cbs
approached
them
would
be
disinclined
to
deal
directly
with
cbs.
they
would
insist
said
cbs
on
dealing
through
ascap.
and
second
said
cbs,
there
was
no
machinery
by
which
cbs
could
obtain
direct
licenses
for
the
compositions
in
the
ascap
repertory.
these
were
the
central
issues
tried
out
as
matters
of
fact
before
the
district
court
for
eight
solid
weeks
and
in
what
the
second
circuit
called
a
painstaking
appraisal
and
analysis
of
the
facts,
judge
lasker,
the
district
judge
reviewed
all
of
the
evidence
carefully
and
held
against
cbs
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
every
point.
he
said
that
cbs
had
not
established
that
ascap’s
members
would
be
disinclined
to
deal
with
cbs
approach
them,
he
said
to
the
contrary.
the
evidence
was
that
if
cbs
asked
them,
they
would
line-up
at
cbs’s
door,
anxious
to
deal,
because
after
all
what
is
their
business,
their
business
is
selling
their
music
and
getting
it
exposed
on
national
television
for
the
benefit
of
the
record
sales
and
sheet
music
sales,
which
are
promoted
of
course
by
network
television
exposure.
on
the
machinery
issue,
judge
lasker
said
all
cbs
had
to
do
was
ask
the
machinery
already
existed
or
would
spring
into
existence
quickly
if
cbs
only
indicated
its
interest
and
so
finding
the
district
court
dismissed
all
of
cbs’s
claims.
i
should
note
a
most
unusual
aspect
of
this
trial
and
i
think
it
deserves
emphasis.
cbs
was
not
claiming
the
status
of
suffering
victim,
it
did
not
claim
that
it
had
attempted
to
obtain
direct
licenses
from
ascap’s
members
or
for
that
matter
from
bmi's
members
and
then
refused
nor
had
it
found
that
the
machinery
for
direct
licensing
would
not
work,
rather
cbs's
entire
case
was
the
product
of
speculation
of
conjecture.
cbs
said
that
it
--
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
yes
although
actually
i
think
your
honor,
their
licenses
have
now
expired
and
they
are
proceeding
on
interim
arrangements.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
we
negotiated
a
deal
with
cbs
retroactive
through
december
31,
69,
retroactive
to
i
believe
1962
your
honor.
typically,
network
licenses
have
been
for
five
years.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
yes.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
well,
there
was
an
interim
arrangement
your
honor
because
the
history
of
dealings
between
ascap
and
its
television
licensees
has
been
studded
by
litigation
but
there
was
an
interim
arrangement
under
the
amended
final
ascap
amended
final
judgment.
as
your
honor
is
perhaps
--
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
it
had
no
expiration
date
your
honor.
cbs
had
applied
to
the
southern
district
court,
judge
ryan
for
the
setting
of
reasonable
fee
for
a
license
and
under
the
ascap
amended
final
judgment
whenever
the
court
gets
around
the
setting
that
fee,
it
will
be
retroactive
to
the
time
when
the
application
was
originally
filed.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
no,
they
have
the
right
to
drop
it
whenever
they
wanted
to.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
yes
for
our
practical
purposes.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
retroactively,
the
court
would
still
have
the
power
to
set
fees
but
not
prospectively.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
no
your
honor,
they
could
have
cancelled
and
gone
out
into
the
market,
they
could.
what
the
district
court
suggested
it
would
have
been
trued
for
them
to
do
would
be
to
announce.
let
us
say
six
months
or
a
year
in
advance,
they
would
be
cancelling
their
license
and
then
setup
their
direct
licensing
arrangements
so
that
on
a
specific
day
they
could
shift
over
without
the
slightest
penalty.
there
would
have
been
no
problem
there
at
all.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
ascap
undertakes
the
license
all
of
the
compositions
of
all
of
its
members.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
well,
our
agreement
with
our
members
provides
that
we
will
license
all
of
the
members,
all
of
each
members
copyrights,
now
whether
we
could
say
to
a
member,
we
have
decided
only
to
license
your
music
in
most
time
or
your
music
in
--
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
right.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
i
do
not
know
just
how
the
amended
final
judgment
would
be
read
on
that
subject
where
it
deals
with
the
licensing
of
specified
works
but
by
category,
that
is
i
should
think
there
would
be
no
written
bar,
i
can
say
it
is
never
been
done
and
i
think
the
ascap
members
would
regarded
as
a
breach
of
their
understanding
with
ascap.
irving
berlin
has
joined
ascap
to
have
all
of
his
works
licensed,
not
to
have
his
serious
composition
--
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
the
agreement
provides
that
ascap
will
license
the
members'
entire
repertory.
now
i
can
not
really
--
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
not
deliberately
i
assure
your
honor,
but
it
is
not
a
question
that
has
ever
been
raised
in
ascap's
history
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
think
it
would
startle
ascap's
members
to
be
told
that
some
of
their
works
were
being
licensed
and
not
others.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
as
a
matter
of
contractual
right,
i
think
the
issue
is
in
doubt
your
honor;
that
is
all
i
can
say.
i
think
the
expectation
of
ascap's
members
is
that
all
of
their
compositions
will
be
licensed
whenever
ascap
grants
a
license.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
it
does
not
promote
in
this,
well,
to
a
slight
degree
your
honor,
not
significantly.
we
do
make
contributions
to
country
music
festivals
and
we
do
may
--
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
no,
we
are
after
all,
we
speak
for
all
of
our
members,
not
perhaps
justice
stevens
goes
to
your
question.
we
do
not
push
the
work
of
any
member
nor
the
type
music
of
any
member,
nor
country
music
as
opposed
to
rock
and
roll
or
sole.
that
would
be
entirely
out
of
keeping
with
ascap
style
of
operation.
we
exist
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
our
members
and
represent
them
all
simultaneously.
now
--
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
i
am
indeed
your
honor
and
i
will
close
very
quickly
with
just
this
reminder
if
i
may.
of
the
options
that
are
opened
to
cbs
or
any
other
television
network,
they
are
seems
to
me
of
extraordinary
range
and
extraordinary
benefit.
first,
cbs
has
the
right
the
district
court
found
as
well
as
the
ability
to
deal
individually
and
get
all
the
music
it
needs.
second,
if
cbs
wants
to
save
the
transactional
costs
and
do
without
the
bother
and
the
trouble
of
dealing
with
individual
members
of
ascap,
it
has
the
right
to
go
to
ascap
and
it
can
take
its
pick
between
a
program
license
under
which
it
pays
only
for
each
program
that
it
broadcasts
containing
ascap
music
or
a
blanket
license
where
its
rights
are
absolutely
unlimited.
and
its
options
do
not
stop
there
because
it
has
the
right
under
the
ascap
amended
final
judgment
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
have
the
court
supervise
negotiations
between
ascap
and
cbs
so
that
if
ascap
attempts
to
obtain
an
unreasonable
fee,
the
court
is
standing
by
to
guarantee
that
there
will
be
a
reasonable
fee.
this
i
think
make
cbs
an
economic
entity
having
advantages
that
are
just
about
unparalleled
in
our
society.
i
cannot
think
of
any
other
buyer
who
has
the
option
of
dealing
individually
with
his
suppliers
or
if
calling
upon
them
indeed
compelling
them
by
virtue
of
the
amended
final
judgment
to
ban
together
and
sell
him
all
of
their
products
at
a
court
supervised
price.
i
do
not
know
any
other
business
that
has
that
kind
of
advantage,
that
kind
of
benefit.
and
with
that,
i
will
stop,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
mr.
chief
justice
of
the
court
please
i
attempted
to
reserve
a
couple
of
minutes,
i
will
use
no
more
than
that
of
course.
i
think
there
was
a
question
put
about
what
the
situation
is
today
and
so
i
thought
i
would
perhaps
bring
the
court
up-to-date
on
that.
the
fact
is
that
today,
the
columbia
television
system
network
holds
no
license
whatsoever
from
ascap
in
order
so
far
as
i
am
aware
from
any
ascap
member.
it
canceled
the
license
it
held
with
us
many
months
ago,
shortly
after
the
second
circuit
came
down
with
its
decision.
it
has
been
playing
the
ascap
music
constantly
ever
since
that
cancellation.
it
has
paid
neither
ascap
nor
anybody
else
one
dime
for
the
exploitation
of
copyrights
in
which
it
has
engaged
and
it
has
merrily
told
us
that
if
we
bring
a
suite
for
infringement
on
behalf
of
any
our
members,
it
will
defend
what
they
claim
that
we
have
misused
our
copyrights
and
so
it
is
immune
against
any
claim
for
infringement
we
are
not
privileged
to
enforce
our
copyrights.
that
is
where
matters
stand
today.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
so
far,
i
would
not
attempt
to
speak
for
bmi
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
of
the
fact
there.
now,
that
causes
me
to
plead
with
perhaps
special
vigor
for
this
court
if
it
agrees
with
us
that
there
has
been
no
per
se
violation
of
law,
not
to
remand
this
eight
year-old
case
for
further
enquiry
or
further
trial
or
further
anything
else,
but
since
the
district
court
found
that
cbs
had
failed
totally
in
every
assertion
of
fact
that
it
made,
we
submit
that
the
proper
course
is
to
end
matters
here
and
in
effect
to
serve
notice
on
the
world
that
antitrust
litigation
really
is
not
and
will
not
be
tolerated
by
this
court
to
be
endless.
i
ask
the
court
to
remind
the
parties
here
that
it
can
sometimes
make
sense
to
negotiate
rather
than
litigate.
we
have
been
standing
ready
to
do
so
for
years,
we
still
are,
we
would
welcome
the
opportunity.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
mr.
justice.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
well,
your
honor
i
take
it
means
a
film
company
asking
for
a
blanket
license
from
ascap.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
the
sync
rights
apply
to
television.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
right.
well,
sync
rights
are
negotiated
individually
in
dealings
between
the
producer
of
a
show
for
television
and
a
copyright
proprietor
when
a
producer
discovers
that
he
needs
a
song,
he
calls
up
usually
through
the
harry
fox
agency
and
gets
a
quote
on
the
sync
rate.
those
transactions
are
relatively
rare
your
honor.
a
few
hundred
years
is
the
totality
of
them
and
i
think
that
probably
explains
why
there
are
no
blanket
licenses
as
well.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
yeah,
there
is
one
lady
in
new
york
who
handles
the
whole
thing
and
--
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
there
are
no
blanket
licenses.
certainly
not
in
motion
picture
market.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
well
in
the
motion
picture
field
your
honor,
we
are
enjoying
under
the
amended
final
judgment
from
granting
licenses
for
many
--
in
anyway
dealing
in
licenses
for
performance
rights.
ascap
is
not
in
that
business,
so
we
could
not
issue
a
blanket
license.
mr.
jay
h.
topkis
i
do
not
know
again,
i
leave
to
mr.
kearse
to
acquaint
your
honor
with
the
facts
there.
thank
you
very
much.
