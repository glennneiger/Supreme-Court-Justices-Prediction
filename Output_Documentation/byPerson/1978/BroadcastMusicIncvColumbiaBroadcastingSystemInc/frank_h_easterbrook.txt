mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
believes
the
three
considerations
govern
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case.
first,
under
one
circumstances
should
agreements
among
competitors
beheld
on
lawful
per
se,
second
are
the
blanket
licenses
of
ascap
and
bmi
so
likely
to
be
add
a
competitive
that
they
come
within
this
class
and
third,
if
blanket
licenses
are
not
always
unlawful,
should
a
per
se
rule
nonetheless
be
employed
because
of
the
particular
circumstances
of
one
user
or
class
of
users
of
music.
i
will
address
those
questions
in
turn.
my
first
proposition
is
that
per
se
rules
should
be
employed
only
when
a
particular
species
of
conduct
is
so
likely
to
be
anticompetitive,
that
a
particular
trial
of
particular
circumstances
would
not
be
worth
of
time
and
effort
because
there
are
so
few
justified
examples
of
that
species.
in
those
circumstances,
there
is
no
reason
to
go
through
a
full
trial.
per
se
rules
are
attractive
precisely
because
they
are
understandable
and
certain.
they
make
compliance
with
the
law
simple,
they
make
business
counseling
easy
and
they
make
trials
short;
they
are
thus
highly
desirables.
and
the
united
states
has
consistently
urged
that
per
se
rules
be
employed
whenever
that
is
feasible.
but
if
certainty
alone
were
enough
to
call
for
per
se
treatment,
all
of
antitrust
law
would
quickly
be
reduced
to
a
series
of
harmonies.
there
must
be
some
reason
for
each
rule.
when
we
say
that
certain
conduct
is
so
likely
to
be
anticompetitive
that
we
can
omit
particular
inquiry,
we
are
talking
about
antitrust
and
economic
injury.
the
court's
focus
has
been
on
economic
efficiency.
when
concerted
conduct
raises
price,
reduces
the
efficiency
of
production
and
decreases
the
amount
of
goods
supplied,
the
consumer
loses
and
he
changes
to
vest
desirable
substitutes.
the
prospect
of
earning
especially
high
profits
also
induces
firms
to
spend
their
time
and
resources
gathering
a
monopoly
and
all
of
the
resources
used
in
this
way
are
wasted.
but
the
harming
question
is
economic.
precisely
because
the
harm
is
economic,
the
court
has
also
considered
economic
benefits.
sometimes
collaboration
even
between
competitors
yields
new
benefits,
lower
costs
and
so
on.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
united
states
your
honor
did
not
participate
in
the
trial
of
this
case
and
has
not
fully
examined
the
record
of
this
case.
there
is
a
legitimate
concern
i
believe
about
monopolization
under
section
2
and
because
the
trial
of
this
case
went
of
essentially
on
tie-in
and
price
fixing
grounds.
the
united
states
believes
that
the
possibility
of
monopolization
what
might
be
termed
the
alcoa
and
united
shoe
machinery
theory,
was
not
explored
as
fully
as
it
might
have
been.
it
seems
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
there
are
limits
on
the
effect
that
ascap
could
have
on
price.
at
some
point,
the
price
ascap
charges
becomes
sufficiently
high
that
it
is
best
expensive
for
cbs
or
for
anybody
else
to
seek
direct
licenses.
at
that
point,
any
authority
ascap
might
have
over
prices
expires.
and
so
in
that
sense,
it
is
clear
from
the
record
of
this
case
that
the
price
ascap
is
charging
is
less
than
the
price
that
cbs
would
pay
through
direct
licensing,
assuming
that
cbs's
behaving
in
a
rational
economic
way.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
does
your
honor,
it
does
provide
there
is
both
the
compulsion
that
ascap
permit
direct
licensing,
not
interfere
with
direct
licensing
in
anyway,
and
a
rule
that
the
consent
decree
court
can
set
a
price
for
anyone
who
applies
and
can
not
reach
an
agreement
with
ascap.
i
must
say
that,
that
has
never
been
done,
that
is
the
consent
decree
court
has
never
set
a
price.
there
have
been
numerous
applications
of
the
consent
decree
court
that
all
have
been
settled,
perhaps
because
the
judicial
machinery
is
even
less
well
suited
than
the
machinery
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
setting
reasonable
prices
for
economic
goods.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
and
slower
it,
and
that
is
hard.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
am
sorry
your
honor
if
my
answer
is
sounded
like
evasion.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
the
tendency
of
my
answer
and
it
is
â€“
i
must
say
that
i
can
not
give
a
definite
answer
precisely
because
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
do
not
have
a
view
but
there
are
considerations
that
indicate
that
the
price
appears
to
be
lowering.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
certainly
not
your
honor,
i
was
just
attempting
to
draw
inferences
from
the
record
bearing
on
the
question
mr.
justice
stevens
asked,
i
am
not
qualified
as
an
economic
expert
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
does
but
that
is
also
drawn
from
the
record
and
from
this
court's
cases.
but
my
point
was
that
there
are
some
forms
of
collaboration
between
competitors
that
are
undoubtedly
beneficial.
the
formation
of
new
firms,
the
mergers
between
existing
firms,
and
the
creation
of
a
joint
ventures,
all
involve
competitors
or
potential
competitors
who
cooperate
in
someway
or
other.
it
is
precisely
because
of
these
forms
of
economic
cooperation
without
which
one
could
not
have
a
corporation
or
indeed
much
of
any
other
economic
enterprise
are
beneficial
to
the
economy
but
the
court
has
been
hesitant
to
apply
per
se
rules
to
economic
cooperation.
the
basic
distinction
i
am
suggesting
in
the
formulation
of
per
se
rules
is
the
one
recognized
by
judge
taft
in
his
famous
opinion
in
addyston
pipe
&
steel
and
an
important
foundation
of
antitrust
law
between
naked
restraints
and
economic
integration.
naked
restraints
between
competitors
rarely
produce
economic
benefits
and
because
they
sometimes
cause
loss
they
are
deemed
unlawful
per
se.
forms
of
economic
integration
on
the
other
hand
although
they
contain
the
potential
for
economic
laws,
also
contain
a
great
potential
for
gain.
and
that
brings
to
me
my
second
proposition,
which
is
that
ascap
is
not
a
naked
restraint.
ascap
is
clearly
a
form
of
joint
venture.
as
a
rule,
blanket
licenses
issued
by
ascap
produced
real
benefits.
a
blanket
license
is
a
product
that
only
a
joint
venture
can
sell,
no
composer,
no
small
combination
of
composers
can
sell
what
ascap
sells.
what
ascap
sells
is
the
right
to
use
great
quantities
of
music
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
without
searching
for
a
composer,
without
negotiating
for
a
contract
and
without
fear
of
infringing
anyone's
rights.
users
of
music
apparently
find
that
package
of
rights
valuable,
if
only
because
the
cost
of
searching
for
a
composer
and
negotiating
a
contract
in
many
cases
exceeds
the
total
value
of
the
music.
the
figures
given
by
cbs
at
page
22,
first
note
of
its
brief,
disclosed
the
cause
of
negotiating
composition
by
composition
through
an
agency
and
they
run
from
$5-up
per
composition.
for
many
uses
of
music,
radio,
bars,
and
the
like,
the
total
value
was
significantly
less
than
$5
and
without
some
form
of
license
of
the
sort
ascap
offers,
those
transactions
would
never
take
place
at
all.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
do
mean
generically
to
include
bmi
and
i
am
generally
referring
to
the
practice
of
offering
blanket
licenses.
in
any
event,
with
apologies
to
(inaudible)
,
if
there
were
no
ascap,
it
would
be
necessary
to
create
it.
the
blanket
license
is
beneficial
to
music
users
and
its
economic
value
rather
than
any
arguments
about
market
necessity
makes
per
se
treatment
inappropriate.
to
say
a
cbs
does
that
ascap
is
unlawful
per
se
because
it
fixes
a
price
is
to
make
antitrust
law
depend
on
tautologies.
of
course,
ascap
fixes
a
price,
it
must
fix
a
price,
every
firm,
every
joint
venture
sets
a
price
for
the
thing
it
makes
and
the
members
of
the
firm
or
the
joint
venture
do
not
compete
against
each
other
within
the
firm
to
sell
the
thing
they
make
at
a
lower
price.
there
is
no
competition
in
the
sale
of
ascap
licenses
because
only
ascap
makes
ascap
licenses
and
similarly
there
is
no
competition
in
the
sale
of
bmi
licenses,
there
is
also
no
competition
in
the
sale
only
schick
razors,
because
only
schick
make
schick
razors,
that
is
a
trivial
argument.
the
important
question
is
whether
there
is
competition
in
the
sale
of
performing
rights,
not
whether
the
joint
venture
is
trying
to
compete
against
itself.
on
that
score,
ascap
and
bmi
have
very
little
in
common
with
price
fixing
cartels.
a
cartel
tries
to
drive
up
prices
by
curtailing
supply.
here
there
is
not
curtailment
indeed
because
of
the
low
price
under
the
blanket
license
it
may
be
that
there
is
too
much
music
use.
a
cartel
tries
to
stop
competition
among
its
members
or
at
least
stay
agree
not
to
compete
with
one
another
individually.
there
is
no
such
agreement
here
and
it
seems
conceded
and
the
district
court
found
that
they
would
lineup
at
cbs's
door
if
they
were
asked.
so
my
argument
so
for
has
been
that
blanket
licenses
produce
economic
benefits.
the
per
se
rule
does
not
apply
to
them
precisely
because
joint
venture
of
this
sort
offering
a
product
of
this
sort
have
some
economic
utility.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
white,
so
long
as
cbs
maintains
its
blanket
license.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
operating
under
an
interim
license
allowing
it
to
use
all
of
ascap's
and
bmi's
repertory.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
terminable
will.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
only
indication
in
the
record
in
that
is
the
warner
brothers
episode
which
was
discussed
by
miss
kearse,
in
which
someone
came
to
cbs
or
not
necessarily
cbs
but
to
users
to
radio
networks,
and
were
turned
down.
reason
for
that
not
necessarily
the
warner
episode
but
the
reason
in
general
if
one
publishing
company
showed
up
is
that
under
the
ascap
blanket
license,
cbs
has
the
right
to
use
those
compositions
at
zero
marginal
cost,
they
won't
pay
additionally
for
them.
the
impetus
to
change
the
system
has
to
come
from
the
user
who
can
announce
say
as
of
a
year
from
now,
i
will
stop
buying
a
blanket
license
and
will
shift
to
either
individual
licenses
with
particular
composers
or
to
per-program
licenses
to
pickup
those
things
on
which
i
do
not
make
individual
deals.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
would
be
completely
useless
for
them
if
we
go
to
cbs
now.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
as
a
matter
of
convenience,
it
may
be
that
if
you
keep
a
record
and
pay
a
royalty,
no
one
will
prosecute
you,
but
in
fact
the
bond
requires
that
you
have
the
license
before
you
make
the
broadcast;
that
provides
for
a
free
economic
bargaining.
if
you
first
broadcast
it
and
then
go
and
tender
$2,
it
is
very
difficult
to
reach
an
unbridled
economic
agreement
between
a
seller
of
rights
and
a
buyer
of
rights.
it
is
a
way
to
comply
(inaudible).
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
is
a
provision
in
the
law
with
respect
to
mechanical
recordings
providing
that
anyone
can
use
or
copyright
a
copyright
for
a
little
more
than
$0.02
per
copyright.
in
that
compulsory
license
was
put
into
the
law
because
of
difficulties
in
policing
because
of
difficulties
in
setting
royalties
etcetera.
but
that
is
i
believe
the
only
provision
of
a
law
providing
for
a
compulsory
license
at
determining
fee.
in
other
cases,
these
are
supposed
to
be
negotiated
in
advance
to
seek
permission.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
criminal
offense.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is
i
think
a
little
difficult
to
determine
how
those
negotiations
would
come
out.
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
that
has
some
of
the
characteristics
of
bilateral
monopoly.
the
cbs
which
owns
music
in
the
can,
can
say
unless
you
give
me
a
license
for
cheap,
i
will
never
broadcast
this
and
you
will
never
get
a
penny.
the
owner
of
the
copyright
can
say
unless
you
pay
me
a
great
deal
of
money,
i
will
deny
your
license
and
you
will
never
be
able
to
get
to
broadcast
it
and
it
is
worth
a
lot
of
money
to
you
to
broadcast.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
a
two
party
hold-up
and
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
in
the
circumstances
of
the
two
party
hold-up,
a
fair
price
would
be
reached.
there
are
other
answers
to
the
music
in
the
can,
problem
among
them
the
per-program
license.
if
for
some
reasons
cbs
is
unable
to
obtain
individual
licenses
on
those
kinds
of
things,
it
can
obtain
a
per-program
license
available
under
the
consent
decree.
and
there
is
also
i
believe
some
oddity
in
cbs's
making
this
argument
because
for
years,
it
has
always
had
the
option
of
obtaining
a
contingent
license,
a
license
in
the
nature
of,
if
we
ever
drop
the
blanket
license,
we
are
licensed
to
perform
this
at
a
royalty
of
blank
percent
or
blank
dollars.
that
license,
a
contingent
license
of
that
sort
should
be
easily
available
in
the
market
on
request.
cbs
has
never
requested
such
a
license,
and
to
this
day
has
not
obtained
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
it
would
and
it
would
alleviate
the
problem
prospectively
but
the
suit
began
almost
a
decade
ago,
cbs
has
had
the
option
of
seeking
such
licenses
and
has
never
sought
them.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
not
true
mr.
justice
stevens,
what
the
nature
of
the
payment
might
be.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
in
the
nature
of
an
option
mr.
justice
stevens
and
options
are
generally
available
although
not
necessarily
at
a
high
price,
but
the
promise
to
pay,
the
major
promise
to
pay
would
be
if
we
ever
use
it
outside
a
blanket
license,
we
will
promise
to
pay.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
i
would
certainly
agree
that
you
have
to
pay
a
price
for
the
option.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
but
their
argument
of
course
is
they
want
to
cancel
a
blanket
license
and
they
want
to
setup
a
circumstance
under
which
they
can
do
it.
the
point
i
was
making
was
that
they
have
not
setup
the
circumstance
and
now
it
is
very
hard
for
them
to
complain
that
they
can
be
held
up
when
they
have
not
done
what
is
necessary
and
within
their
power
to
prevent
the
hold-up.
