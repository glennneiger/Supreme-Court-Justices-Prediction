ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
broadcast
music,
inc.
which
we
refer
to
commonly
as
bmi.
we
are
here
we
believe
on
a
simple
question.
the
question
as
decided
by
the
second
circuit
is
whether
or
not
the
offering
of
blanket
licenses
by
bmi
and
ascap
constitutes
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
this
question
was
presented
to
the
second
circuit
by
cbs
as
a
question
of
law.
cbs
did
not
attack
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court,
cbs
urged
the
court
of
appeals
not
to
make
a
rule
of
reason
inquiry,
cbs
simply
urged
the
court
of
appeals
to
find
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
offering
of
blanket
licenses
was
per
se
illegal.
the
court
of
appeals
did
find
that
the
offering
of
blanket
licenses
is
per
se
illegal.
the
court
did
this
despite
the
fact
that
it
recognized
that
the
offering
of
this
kind
of
license
is
not
a
naked
restraint,
is
not
generally
unlawful,
is
something
that
is
required
by
some
users,
is
something
that
is
deemed
very
convenient
by
other
users.
and
as
a
result
of
the
recognition
of
the
values
and
the
advantages
of
the
availability
of
blanket
licensing,
the
court
of
appeals
despite
the
fact
that
it
said
blanket
licensing
is
per
se
illegal,
decided
that
the
offering
of
blanket
licenses
should
not
be
enjoined.
i
think
the
reason
the
court
of
appeals
fell
into
the
error
of
finding
that
blanket
licensing
is
per
se
illegal
is
apparent
from
one
particular
passage
in
its
opinion
in
which
it
says
the
availability
of
blanket
licensing
gives
the
copyright
owner
the
right
to
choose
the
way
in
which
his
work
will
be
licensed.
i
say
that
is
error
because
there
is
no
support
in
the
record
for
that
at
all.
as
mr.
topkis
has
indicated,
the
record
in
this
case
is
a
bit
unusual
because
we
have
cbs
pressing
its
claim
not
on
the
basis
of
anything
that
has
happened
to
cbs
because
cbs
never
attempted
to
get
direct
licenses
from
copyright
owners.
the
questioning
a
trial,
the
questioning
on
depositions
was
largely
hypothetical;
would
you
grant
a
direct
license
to
cbs
if
it
asked,
what
would
happen
cbs
asked
if
we
tried
to
go
the
direct
licensing
route?
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
speculation
from
cbs's
witnesses
on
this
score
but
the
speculation
came
from
witnesses
who
had
never
talked
to
a
writer
or
a
publisher.
the
great
book
of
the
testimony
from
knowledgeable
people
in
the
industry
was
that
direct
licensing
would
definitely
be
available
as
one
of
cbs's
former
vice
presidents
mike
then
testified,
the
top
composers
and
publishers
are
intensely
eager
to
have
their
work
performed
and
the
average
composer
is
out
of
work.
if
you
let
them
know
you
are
interested,
you
won't
be
able
to
get
them
out
of
your
office.
and
this
is
why
the
district
court
found
that
the
record
was
replete
with
the
darwinian
imagery
of
cut
through
competition
of
publishers
hungry
for
performances
of
their
works
and
why
he
concluded,
hyperbolically
of
course,
but
why
he
concluded
that
if
cbs
just
let
them
know.
the
cbs
was
in
the
market
for
direct
licenses,
they
would
line-up
at
cbs's
door.
and
these
findings
were
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
found
that
direct
licenses
are
available,
that
there
can
be
a
market
for
direct
licensing,
that
this
market
can
co-exist
with
the
offering
of
blanket
licenses.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
nothing
at
all
your
honor.
as
far
as
bmi
is
concerned,
cbs
has
raised
an
issue
in
its
briefs
or
attempted
to
raise
an
issue
in
its
briefs
as
to
the
availability
of
direct
licenses
from
bmi
affiliates.
approximately
year
and
half
before
trial,
cbs
and
bmi
entered
into
a
stipulation
which
provided
in
effect
that
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
direct
licenses
from
bmi
affiliates,
cbs
and
bmi
would
be
governed
by
what
the
district
court
found
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
direct
licenses
from
ascap
members
and
that
--
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
yes
it
is
your
honor.
and
at
the
trail,
repeatedly
cbs
used
the
stipulation
in
order
to
get
into
evidence,
depositions
and
documents
which
on
their
face
related
only
to
ascap
members
and
the
availability
of
direct
licenses
from
ascap
members
and
bmi
honored
that
stipulation
and
i
see
no
reason
why
that
stipulation
should
not
remain
in
effect.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
i
know
of
no
instance
in
which
a
television
network
has
actually
sought
direct
licenses.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
we
have
in
the
record
your
honor,
two
evidence
with
respect
to
two
experiences
in
direct
licensing
or
attempted
direct
licensing.
in
one
instance
both
of
which
i
might
add
were
brought
to
the
court's
attention
by
cbs,
one
is
knows
as
the
3m
incident
throughout
the
court
papers.
3m
in
the
mid-1960's
decided
to
offer
for
sale
tapes
of
recordings
of
background
music.
3m
attempted
to
get
a
blanket
license
from
ascap.
ascap
suggested
for
various
reasons
that
3m
go
directly
to
the
writers
and
publishers.
3m
did
go
to
the
publishers
and
approximately
80%
of
the
publishers
that
3m
contacted
did
grant
licenses.
the
other
--
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
am
speaking
of
minnesota
mining,
it
has
come
to
be
called
colloquially
3m.
the
other
instance
in
the
record
with
respect
to
an
attempt
at
direct
licensing
occurred
--
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
there
were
eight
that
did
not
eventually
enter
into
agreements.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
i
believe
there
is
no
finding
in
the
record
as
to
the
exact
percentage
or
the
approximate
percentage
that
would
be
available
by
direct
licensing
but
we
must
remember
that
most
of
the
music
that
is
used
on
cbs
television
network
is
composed
specifically
for
the
program.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
the
feature
music
most
of
it
is
composed
by
persons
outside
of
the
program
packager's
control.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
a
great
deal
of
evidence
was
introduced
by
both
sides
at
trial
as
to
the
proportion
of
cbs's
programs
that
used
feature
music.
when
the
trial
started,
there
were
i
believe
six
or
seven
variety
programs
on
cbs.
by
the
time
trial
was
over,
there
was
only
one.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
that
it
was
very
small
in
percentage,
it
is
significant
but
in
that
the
program
packagers
already
are
in
touch
with
the
copyright
owners
of
that
music
that
it
would
not
be
--
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
finding
on
that
so
far
your
honor.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
i
think
the
judge
concluded
that
publishers
and
writers
in
general
would
lineup
at
cbs's
door.
your
honor,
even
the
eight
publishers
who
did
not
eventually
enter
into
agreements
with
3m,
negotiated
with
3m
and
several
of
them
after
refusing
to
enter
into
the
agreements
for
the
first
series
of
3m
tapes
attempted
to
reopen
negotiations
later
with
respect
to
the
second
series.
some
of
them
reached
oral
agreements
with
3m
which
3m
then
decided
we
are
not
appropriate
or
were
desirable.
judge
lasker
did
find
that
there
was
no
concert
of
action.
all
of
the
publishers
had
a
very
real
problem
with
the
concept
of
policing
these
tapes
after
the
three-year
license
period
would
expire.
the
tapes
were
to
be
sold,
the
amount
of
performance
royalties
was
very
small,
the
job
of
policing
20,000
doctors'
and
dentists'
offices
to
see
who
could
be
gotten
to
pay
a
royalty
fee
after
that
three-year
period
had
expired
would
probably
be
again
not
worth
a
candle.
policing
was
a
concern
that
was
voiced
by
all
of
the
publishers
with
whom
3m
dealt,
some
of
them
decided
to
deal
anyway,
80%
of
them,
some
did
not.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
after
the
three-year
period
was
over,
only
about
a
third
of
the
purchasers
of
the
tapes
renewed
their
licenses.
so
and
i
think
very
little
policing
went
on
because
of
the
small
size
of
the
fee
that
would
be
available
and
the
great
cost
involved
in
the
policing.
so
i
think
the
policing
concern
which
â€“-
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
ascap
generally
polices
performances
of
music
but
i
believe
that
it
took
the
position
that
with
respect
to
the
granting
of
direct
licenses,
it
would
not
be
appropriate
for
it
to
expend
the
funds
that
would
normally
be
expended
for
the
whole
membership
to
police
for
a
few
and
even
when
it
does
police,
i
gather
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
it
looses
money
on
the
infringement
suits
that
it
brings
and
the
policing
that
it
does.
so
it
is
not
an
economic
proposition
across-the-board
and
certainly
if
there
are
only
a
few
publishers
involved,
it
is
not.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
i
assume
that
if
ascap
knew
about
it,
it
would
do
something
about
it
but
in
that
instance
i
think
it
would
have
a
much
easier
road
to
travel
against
3m
rather
than
against
the
20,000
doctors
and
dentists.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
i
believe
that
ascap
has
not
policed
the
doctors
and
dentists.
ascap
polices
public
performances
in
night
clubs,
bars,
that
sort
of
thing.
the
other
evidence
of
a
historical
attempt
at
direct
licensing
that
is
in
the
record
is
the
attempt
that
was
made
by
warner
brothers
back
in
the
1930's
when
warners
as
a
music
publisher
had
a
valuable
catalog
that
it
wished
to
license
directly.
warner
did
not
want
to
license
through
ascap
and
therefore
withdrew
its
catalog
from
ascap
and
attempted
to
get
broadcaster
to
take
direct
licenses.
the
broadcasters
did
not
want
direct
licenses
and
therefore
warner
was
unsuccessful
in
this
attempt.
so
of
the
two
historical
situations
we
have
in
the
record,
we
have
one
user
who
wanted
direct
licenses
and
got
them.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
they
had
blanket
licenses
from
ascap.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
their
blank
licenses
did
not
cover
the
warner
catalog
because
warner
withdrew
its
catalog
from
ascap.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
they
would
not
have
--
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
they
could
have
had
both.
they
chose
not
to
take
the
direct
licenses,
they
chose
to
do
without
warner's
music.
and
i
point
out
these
two
situations
because
they
are
opposite
sides
of
the
coin.
in
one,
the
user
wanted
direct
licenses
and
got
them
and
the
publishers
who
wanted
to
license
only
through
a
middle
man
did
not
have
his
music
used.
in
the
other,
the
publisher
wanted
direct
licenses
and
the
broadcasters
wanted
to
license
through
the
middle
man.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
i
do
not
believe
the
record
tells
us
that.
it
only
tells
us
the
fact
that
they
refused.
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
i
think
the
appropriate
inference
to
be
drawn
is
that
it
is
the
users'
choice,
which
transactional
method
he
uses
to
get
his
music
and
if
the
music
is
not
available
by
the
means
the
user
wants
--
ms.
amalya
l.
kearse
i
think
these
two
instances
together
show
that
fairly
clearly
your
honor
and
i
think
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
record
to
indicate
to
the
contrary.
thank
you.
