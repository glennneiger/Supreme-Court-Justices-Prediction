j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hruska,
what
do
you
understand
the
theory
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
indicating
that
the
only
thing
that
is
wrong
with
this
arrangement
is
that
licensing
is
not
on
a
per
use
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
then
ascap
would
be
wholly
acceptable
as
long
as
it
license
on
a
per
use
basis,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
composers
you
mean?
