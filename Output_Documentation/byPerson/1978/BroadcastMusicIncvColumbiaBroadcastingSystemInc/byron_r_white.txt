justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
suppose
the,
mr.
easterbrook,
the
individuals
have
not
lined-up
up
at
the
door
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
it
got
one
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
it
is
terminable
will
or
whatever.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
there
anything
in
the
record
indicate
that
any
individual
has
ever
come
around
to
cbs
willing
to
license
individual?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
not
it
a
criminal
offense
or
you
get
the
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
do
though,
do
not
you?
are
you
defending
the
results
that
you
got
in
the
second
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
not
want
to
destroy
the
common
sales
issue,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
like
to
get
a
better
deal
out
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
is
that
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
are
you
defending
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
though
under
your
theory,
it
is
illegal?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
are
you
defending
a
result,
a
remedy
the
court
of
appeals
gave,
which
according
to
your
theory
is
price
fixing?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
now
suggest
that
you
are
on
both
sides
of
this
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
if
you
are
allowed
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
will
say
that
they
just
both
want
to
use
a
effective
sales
agency
and
want
to
go
to
the
sales
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
he
can
set
the
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
i
perceive
your
argument,
you
are
not
accepting
that
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
ascap
may
proceed
as
long
as
it
gives
you
a
better
brake?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
submitting
--
of
course,
that
would
give
you
more
of
a
remedy
than
you
have
gotten,
are
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
certainly
expand
your
relief
under
the
judgment,
if
we
purported
to
agree
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
you
can
have
both
ways
in
that?
right
now,
there
is
a
remand
of
the
district
court
under
which
a
per-use
licensing
would
be
tried
out
and
under
your
theory,
it
should
not
be
tried
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
court
found
mr.
hruska
that
gave
them
a
year's
notice
or
year
and
a
half,
something
like
that,
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
to
setup
all
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact
mr.
hruska,
if
you
find
an
injury
to
the
business
or
property
of
the
plaintiff,
then
you
ask
for
damages,
where
does
the
judge
get
discretion
to
say
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
had
to
do
with
the
retroactivity
of
new
rule,
did
not
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
saying
with
bmi?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
litigation
involves
challenges
under
the
antitrust
laws
to
some
of
the
business
practices
of
the
american
society
of
composers,
authors
and
publishers
called
ascap,
and
broadcast
music,
inc.
referred
to
as
bmi.
these
two
organizations
act
as
clearinghouses
for
their
member
or
affiliated
composers,
writers
or
publishers
whom
copyrights
on
musical
compositions.
on
behalf
of
the
members
and
affiliates,
ascap
and
bmi
issue
licenses
to
users
of
copyrighted
music,
please
the
market
and
collect
and
distribute
royalties.
they
operate
primarily
through
blanket-licenses
giving
a
licensee
the
right
to
perform
any
and
all
of
the
compositions
owned
by
the
members
or
affiliates
as
often
as
a
license
desires
for
a
stated
term
and
for
a
royalty
that
is
uses
a
percentage
of
total
revenues
or
a
flat
dollar
amount.
this
suit
arose
when
columbia
broadcasting
system,
a
large
user
of
copyrighted
music,
brought
suit
against
ascap
and
bmi
asserting
that
the
blanket-license
as
employed
by
those
organizations
constitutes
price
fixing
and
a
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
as
well
as
being
unlawful
for
other
specified
reasons
under
both
the
antitrust
and
the
copyright
laws.
the
district
court
ruled
against
cbs
and
in
favor
of
ascap
and
bmi
on
all
grounds.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
blanket-license
did
indeed
constitute
a
per
se
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
we
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari
filed
by
ascap
and
bmi
and
i
have
now
filed
an
opinion
in
which
we
hold
in
disagreement
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
blanket-license
is
not
illegal
per
se
under
the
sherman
act
and
remanding
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
any
further
issues
that
may
be
appropriate
in
that
court.
eight
justices,
that
is
seven
other
justices
and
myself,
concur
in
the
opinion
in
which
we
have
filed
and
which
states
at
some
length
the
reasons
for
our
conclusions.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
while
agreeing
with
us
that
the
blanket-license
is
not
illegal
per
se,
he
would
affirm
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
the
challenge
licensing
practice
when
tested
under
the
rule
of
reason
is
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
this
is
an
issue
which
the
majority
opinion
does
not
reach
and
which
may
be
open
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
reversed.
