mr.
daniel
l.
berman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
parties
i
represent
are
the
only
parties
before
the
court
that
have
not
had
access
to
the
grand
jury
materials
in
question.
and
frankly
i
will
be
more
impressed
by
douglas
and
phillips
for
being
concerned
the
grand
jury
secrecy
if
they
were
in
the
same
position
but
they
are
not
in
the
same
position
and
we
are
not
arguing
about
secret
grand
jury
materials
because
the
only
grand
jury
materials
that
the
district
court
were
disclosed
to
the
parties
that
i
represent,
were
grand
jury
transcripts
that
had
already
been
disclosed
to
the
petitioners
douglas
and
phillips
and
documents
produced
by
the
petitioners
douglas
and
phillips
in
connection
with
the
grand
jury
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
we
filed
your
honor
a
rule
34
request
in
the
civil
action
for
these
materials.
we
proceeded
in
the
california
court
where
the
criminal
action
had
been
filed
because
we
believed
under
rule
6(e)
that,
that
was
the
court
in
which
the
petition
had
to
be
filed.
rule
6(e)
says
that
a
court
may
grant
disclosure
of
grand
jury
materials
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding
and
there
was
a
line
of
authority
and
it
made
sense
to
us
to
believe
that
the
court
with
the
primary
responsibility
to
protect
grand
jury
secrecy
was
the
court
charged
with
the
supervision
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
we
do
and
i
think
your
honor
in
light
of
your
other
questions
as
i
read
rule
6(e),
rule
6(e)
expressly
gives
a
quote
in
which
a
criminal
action
has
been
filed,
the
authority
to
entertain
a
petition
for
grand
jury
transcripts.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
your
honor,
it
would
--
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
i
do
not
think
that
is
true
your
honor.
let
me
if
i
may
read
precisely
what
the
rule
says.
they
may
disclose
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
only
when
so
directed
by
the
court
preliminary
to
or
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding
and
your
honor
that
rule
as
we
now
see
it,
as
this
has
been
amended,
expressly
provides
in
subparagraph
c,
disclosure
otherwise
prohibited
by
this
rule
of
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
may
also
be
made
when
so
directed
by
a
court
preliminary
to
or
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding.
it
is
unauthorized
in
provision
to
grant
disclosure.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
the
rule
34
motion
they
filed
an
objection
your
honor
and
we
did
not
proceed
under
rule
37
because
we
believe
and
there
was
again
good
authority
for
our
belief
that
the
court
in
arizona
could
not
grant
that
motion
since
it
involve
the
secrecy
of
grand
jury
transcripts.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
yes
and
let
me
say
why
i
believe
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
well,
there
is
certainly
a
question
whether
the
documents
produced
to
grand
jury
are
grand
jury
materials
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
no
your
honor,
that’s
not
our
position
but
our
position
was
in
our
6(e)
petition.
we
didn’t
seek
these
documents
or
these
materials
from
the
defendant,
we
sought
them
from
the
government.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
it
did
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
is
we
never
called
on
a
rule
37
motion
to
enforce
our
rule
34
demand
in
the
civil
action.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
we
did
not
press
it
in
the
arizona
courts,
we
pressed
it
where
we
thought
it
was
proper
to
press
it,
in
the
california
courts.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
it
is
hard
for
me
to
imagine
that
a
california
court
faced
with
that
kind
of
ruling
would
have
granted
the
motion
but
i
do
not
think
in
fact
that
there
was
even
a
close
question
with
regard
to
the
relevancy
of
these
documents
your
honor.
if
you
just
simply
compare
the
offense
charge
in
indictment
with
the
claims
of
price
that
you
made
in
the
civil
complaint,
they
are
virtually
identical.
and
in
fact,
there
was
no
suggestion,
absolutely
no
concrete
suggestion.
when
this
petition
was
called
on
for
hearing
the
california
court,
as
to
why
the
california
court
should
not
proceed.
i
would
like
to
say
why
--
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
he
did
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
we
would
have
had
–
we
were
granted
the
right
to
make
one
copy
your
honor
and
we
were
got
those
documents
under
protective
order
that
only
permitted
their
use
or
purposes
of
impeachment
and
refreshing
recollection.
i
think
your
honor
that
the
reason
we
believe
that
the
california
court
was
the
proper
court
is
it
is
because
that
court
that
is
going
to
be
in
the
best
position
to
consider
whether
there
are
special
reasons
for
continued
secrecy.
if
there
is
no
reason
for
continued
secrecy,
then
we
are
not
talking
about
any
other
realities
of
the
policies
behind
grand
jury
secrecy
but
the
court
in
which
the
criminal
action
is
pending
is
the
court
that
has
access
to
the
government
employees
that
can
know
whether
there
are
any
particular
risks
of
retaliation.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
he
certainly
was
your
honor
and
they
were
in
the
room
at
the
time
the
petition
was
argued.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
certainly,
i
mean
the
petition
was
addressed
to
the
government,
they
filed
a
response
saying
that
they
had
felt
there
have
been
a
sufficient
showing
of
particularized
need
and
that
they
had
no
objection
to
the
petition
being
granted
but
they
were
in
the
court
room
on
the
day
the
petition
was
argued
and
made
their
appearance,
so
he
had
access
to
--
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
excuse
me,
i
mean
this.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
the
prosecutors.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
the
only
two
cases,
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
the
only
cases
that
were
before
this
court,
pittsburgh
plate,
dennis
and
procter
&
gamble
all
involved
defendants.
the
dennis
case
and
pittsburgh
plate
were
criminal
prosecution
as
that
matter
is
now
covered
by
the
(inaudible).
in
procter
&
gamble,
we
weren’t
talking
about
the
situation.
the
documents,
the
grand
jury
materials
were
sought
in
mass
as
a
substitute
for
discovery
and
there
had
been
no
prior
disclosure.
our
principle
argument
your
honor
is
with
regard
to
the
merits
is
that
there
was
no
further
reason
for
secrecy.
these
documents
have
been
disclosed,
there
was
no
risk
of
retaliation
because
they
were
produced
under
protective
order
that
only
permitted
their
use
for
purposes
of
impeachment
or
refreshing
recollection.
there
is
absolutely
no
risk
in
terms
of
the
interest
protected
by
grand
jury
secrecy,
in
terms
of
the
disclosure
made
and
the
necessity,
the
use
of
these
documents
was
for
the
very
purpose
of
particularized
needs
recognized
by
the
court
in
procter
&
gamble.
that
is
the
court
said
that
examples
of
particularized
need
was
the
need
for
impeachment
and
refreshing
recollection,
it’s
the
need
for
effective
cross-examination
and
that’s
the
only
purpose
to
which
the
use
of
these
documents
could
be
put.
independently,
we
had
asked
in
the
civil
action
and
interrogatory
asked
these
people,
whether
they
had
engaged
any
price
related
conversations
between
phillips
and
douglas
and
between
their
other
defendants
including
gulf,
who
was
an
indicted
coconspirator,
and
they
said
we
have
--
we
are
not
aware
of
any
such
conversations.
they
have
made
those
answers
to
interrogatories
that
they
currently
had
the
grand
jury
transcripts
in
their
possession.
and
i
think
we
are
clearly
entitled
to
the
opportunity
to
impeach
those
answers
that
is
to
show
that
in
fact
they
had
such
conversations,
the
bill
of
particulars
indicated
that
there
were
11
direct
conservations.
and
secondly,
to
show
that
they
knowingly
concealed
the
information
at
the
time
when
they
had
in
their
possession
and
they
are
called
upon
to
provide
an
answer.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
the
only
disclosure,
the
only
doc,
transcripts
involved
were
transcripts
that
were
disclosed
to
the
defendants
pursuant
to
rule
16
which
will
only
relate
to
their
employees
or
former
employees.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
while
these
were
only
their
statements
in
terms
of
the
transcripts
made
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
under
rule
801
your
honor,
there
would
be
admissions
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
well,
i
think
the
answer
simply
is
that
the
court
has
an
extra
step
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
abuse.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
no
your
honor,
we
did
not.
i
think
that
our
position
simply
is
if
we
have
this
information,
we
will
be
able
to
effectively
conduct
cross
examination,
in
a
sense
we
are
going
to
have
to
as
in
any
conspiracy
case,
prove
this
case
out
of
adversary
witnesses;
that’s
what
is
critical
to
us.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
i
think
i
would
say
this
your
honor.
it
certainly
would
be
better
if
we
can
have
them
for
all
purposes
but
the
(inaudible),
we
really
have
to
have
them
for
us.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
your
honor,
we
have
surmised
in
my
part,
but
i
strongly
doubt
it.
there
was
a
healthy
body
of
authority
in
the
lower
courts
that
where
there
was
no
further
reason
for
secrecy.
the
district
courts
use
these
protective
orders
as
a
proper
means
to
reconcile
the
interests
between
secrecy
and
the
search
for
the
truth
and
this
is
proper
balancing.
you
do
not
get
the
documents
and
get
a
chance
to
show
them
to
your
client
and
have
him
run
around
the
industry
and
tell
them
what
was
said
about
people
or
anything
like
that,
that
you
can
only
use
them
for
the
critical
business
of
the
litigation.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
we
did
not
object
your
honor,
to
the
restriction
that
they
be
used
only
for
the
purposes
of
impeachment
or
refreshing
recollection.
and
as
i
said,
it
may
be
to
our
greater
advantage
to
have
them
for
other
purposes,
but
i
view
this
as
the
critical
purpose.
i
would
like
to
make
one
observation.
in
government
litigation
that
ends
in
a
nolo
plea
and
a
consent
decree,
this
is
likely
to
be
the
only
benefits
the
private
plaintiffs
get
out
of
government-related
antitrust
enforcement.
and
the
critical
thing
is
to
be
able
to
use
this
information
where
you
are
having
approved
your
case
out
of
your
advisory’s
mouth
to
obtain
truthful
and
accurate
testimony.
that’s
the
real
guts
of
the
problem
and
that’s
what
we
think
demonstrated
particularized
need
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
well,
i
think
what
we
should
get
your
honor
is
i
think
that
we
should
get
the
benefit
of
truthful
and
accurate
testimony.
that
is
if
there
is
no
reason,
why
these
documents
should
remain
secret
that
they
have
been
disclosed
to
defendant,
if
they
still
have
them
in
their
possession,
why
should
not
we
have
the
opportunity
to
use
relevant
evidence
to
make
sure
that
they
are
furnishing
truthful
and
accurate
testimony
in
the
course
of
the
private
antitrust
litigation?
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
i
think
your
honor,
of
course
what
you
actually
summarized
the
clayton
act,
i
don’t
dispute
that.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
you
can
not
use
the
government
case
then
as
a
means
of
proving
your
case
on
a
prima
facie
basis.
i
do
not
think
that
justifies
our
prevention,
the
parties
from
using
what
was
developed
in
the
government
case
to
determine
the
truth
in
the
civil
action.
and
that
is,
we
like
to
have
the
opportunity
to
use
highly
critical
and
relevant
evidence
for
the
purposes
of
cross-examination,
that’s
not
the
same
thing
as
getting
a
leg
up
because
somebody
file
an
action
and
plead
nolo,
it
depends
what
in
fact
they
said
and
what
their
testimony
is,
that’s
the
normal
business
of
civil
litigation.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
no,
i
would
not
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
l.
berman
i
do
not.
i
think
that
if
you
start
looking
at
the
assumptions
that
would
have
to
be
made
to
say
this
would
change
anything,
they
are
purely
fancible.
what
difference
do
they
make?
the
whole
idea
in
grand
jury
secrecy
is
not
to
give
the
defendants
some
strategic
litigating
advantage,
the
idea
of
grand
jury
secrecy
is
to
serve
the
institution
of
the
grand
jury
and
to
protect
that
in
a
number
of
interests,
most
of
those
are
done
when
the
criminal
proceedings
over,
but
there
is
nothing
and
note
this
court
has
never
indicated
there
is
anything
in
having
grand
jury
secrecy
grant
by
party
in
adversarial
advantage.
i
think
your
honor
i
have
used
my
15
minutes
of
the
arguments.
