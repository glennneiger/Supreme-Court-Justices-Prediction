justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
know
but
the
governmentâ€™s
position,
i
take
it
as
that
there
is
not
much
of
a
burden
on
the
fellow
who
asked
for
it,
he
merely
has
to
show
some
kind
of
relevance
to
these
treble-damage
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
your
position,
that
is
how
particularized
need
amounts
to.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
else
does
he
need
to
show,
tell
me
in
a
few
words?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
not
what
i
asked
you,
i
just
asked
you
what
your
position
is,
what
do
you
think
particularized
need
is?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
first
of
these,
77-1547,
douglas
oil
against
petrol
stops
is
a
case
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
involves
a
question
as
to
when
and
by
whom
transcripts
of
the
grand
jury
investigation
maybe
made
available
to
parties
in
a
collateral
civil
proceedings.
the
issue
was
complicated
because
the
grand
jury
set
in
a
district
court
in
los
angeles
and
a
civil
litigation
within
a
district
court
in
arizona.
as
the
defendant
in
the
civil
suit
had
been
implicated
in
the
grand
jury
investigation,
it
already
possessed
copies
of
the
transcripts
desired
by
the
plaintiff.
the
questions
presented
to
the
los
angeles
district
court
included
the
broad
policy
question
whether
the
need
for
disclosure
was
greater
than
the
need
for
grand
jury
secrecy
and
also
whether
the
plaintiff
in
the
arizona
case
was
requesting
only
those
portions
of
the
transcripts
that
were
in
fact
relevant
to
that
proceedings.
as
we
think
the
arizona
court
conducting
the
civil
proceedings
was
in
a
better
position
than
the
los
angeles
court
to
determine
the
relevancy
and
need
for
the
transcripts.
it
was
error
for
the
latter
court
to
have
ordered
that
delivery.
as
this
order
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
we
now
reverse
that
decision.
our
reasons
are
set
forth
in
the
court's
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
had
dissented
in
an
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart
have
joined.
