justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gillam.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
is
a
civil
or
criminal
action
as
you
can
see
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
not
mean
the
arizona
action;
i
mean
these
rather
odd
proceedings
that
took
place
over
in
california.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
get
to
the
court
of
appeals
pursuant
to
what
28
u.s.c.
1292.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
a
final
decision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
–
on
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction,
the
district
court
was
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
but
ordinarily
you
do
not
have
third-party
such
as
your
opponents
intervening
in
a
criminal
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that
is
what
you
said.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
are
not
bound
i
take
it
by
the
views
of
the
criminal
division
of
the
central
division
of
the
district
court
of
california.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn’t
it
bother
you
at
all
that
the
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
here
or
how
the
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it’s
a
very
unorthodox
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
anyone
can
then
come
in
and
ask
for
the
documents.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
they
are
turned
down
or
if
they
are
granted,
in
either
case,
it’s
a
final
decision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
appealable
to
the
court
of
appeal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
we
are
reviewing
here
mr.
gillam
of
course
is
the
court
of
appeal’s
decision
which
said
that
district
court’s
ruling
was
not
an
abusive
discussion
as
i
read
the
last
paragraph
of
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
district
judge
who
passed
on
this
motion,
the
one
who
had
trialed
the
criminal
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
just
have
to
be
a
calendar
judge
or
a
motion
judge
for
this
kind
of
–
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
then
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
entitled,
i
suppose
to
rely
very
heavily
on
the
district
court’s
knowledge
of
the
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
former
president
of
the
bar
association.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
whose
behest
did
he
file
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
prepared
to
say
it
was
not
filed
on
your
behest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
not
you
make
a
motion
for
production
in
the
civil
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
you
did
a
rule
34
motion.
you
regard
your
6(e)
proceeding
in
the
central
district
as
independent
if
that
i
take?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
sentence
of
rule
(e),
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
i
read
it,
it
is
just
a
rule
is
a
6(e)
is
a
negative,
it’s
a
prohibition
that
says
it
shall
not
be
released
unless.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
happened
to
your
rule
34
motion
in
the
arizona
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
any
realistic
chance
that
judge
gray
was
going
to
interview
the
government
employees
who
testified
in
that
grand
jury
proceeding
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
he
could
have
been
have
questions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
employees,
the
witnesses
were
or
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
the
employees
or
i
take
it
now
you
meant
the
attorneys.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
incidentally,
have
any
of
our
cases
ever
held
that
anybody
other
than
a
defendant
in
the
government’s
case
is
entitled
to
production
of
grand
jury
testimony?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
make
sure
that
a
private
plaintiffs
should
get
any
sort
of
benefit
out
of
a
plea
that
ends
in
a
nolo,
out
of
a
government
case
ends
in
a
nolo
plea?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
we
certainly
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
a
separate
civil
action
can
be
commenced
in
california
by
treble-damage
plaintiffs.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
beale,
you
are
amicus.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
a
party,
i
am
sorry.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
ahead.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
documents
that
they
gave
to
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
incident
to
which
you
refer
create
federal
jurisdiction
the
california
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don’t
have
to
get
in
under
28
u.s.c.
1331
or
13
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
the
request
of
a
party
who
was
in
no
way
a
party
to
the
criminal
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
mrs.
beale,
you
are
talking
about
a
court
which
has
probably
20
judges
and
a
motion
which
comes
up
simply
on
the
motion
docket
and
so
you
cannot
mean
that
the
judge
who
passes
on
this
motion
is
going
to
have
intimate
familiarity
with
the
past
history
of
criminal
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
the
treble-damages
plaintiff
come
in
twenty
years
after
the
nolo
plea
was
entered
and
the
criminal
case
was
entered
–
criminal
case
was
ended
and
ask
for
these
things.
and
then,
whatever
judge
happens
to
be
on
the
bench
at
the
time,
whatever
assistant
us
attorney
happens
to
be
sent
over,
that
is
not
going
to
be
a
very
accurate
reflection,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
else
is
there?u
