mr.
jistice
marshall
as
between
the
two
courts.
isn’t
it
true
that
where
the
nolo
contendere
court,
all
they
are
custodians.
once
the
case
is
over
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
might
not
even
be
there,
they
might
be
in
some
depository,
so
why
did
they
have
any
greater
interest
in
this
than
the
court
that
is
in
the
trial
of
the
suit,
the
civil
suit?
mr.
jistice
marshall
well,
i
don’t
know
but
i
am
sure
that
all
of
the
records
of
the
trials
in
the
southern
district
in
new
york
are
not
in
that
building,
because
the
building
is
just
not
that
big.
so
they
are
in
a
depository
at
some
place
while
assuming
they
are
in
the
depository
at
st.
louis.
where
do
they
get
any
more
expertise
than
the
judges
on
trial
of
the
case?
mr.
jistice
marshall
usually,
isn’t
the
"prosecute"
of
the
antitrust
case
after
the
nolo,
isn't
he
now
back
in
washington?
mr.
jistice
marshall
is
he
now
here
in
the
washington?
mr.
jistice
marshall
but
isn’t
true
that
all
antitrust
cases
are
under
the
immediate
supervision
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states?
mr.
jistice
marshall
and
he
is
in
washington?
