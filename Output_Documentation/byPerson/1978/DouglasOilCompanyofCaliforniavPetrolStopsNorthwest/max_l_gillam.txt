mr.
max
l.
gillam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
here
today
the
petitioner
douglas
oil
company
of
california,
but
i
will
also
be
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
other
petitioner
phillips
petroleum.
i
would
propose
to
break
this
argument
down
into
five
parts
and
want
to
inform
the
court
of
this
now,
so
that
if
there
are
particular
questions,
the
court
may
elect
if
it
wish
to
defer
them
till
later
on.
first
of
all,
i
am
going
to
talk
about
what
i
think
there
is
confusion
about
which
is
what
exactly
the
petitioners
are
requesting
here
and
what
the
petitioners
are
not
requesting.
secondly,
i
will
talk
about
the
facts
for
a
few
minutes.
third,
the
position
of
the
government
in
these
proceedings
and
i
believe
that
the
government
is
sitting
today
at
the
wrong
table
in
connection
with
this
grand
jury
transcript
argument.
fourth,
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
procedures
for
the
determination
of
particularized
need
and
fifth
our
belief
in
the
significance
of
this
court’s
reaffirmation
of
the
principles
contained
in
procter
&
gamble.
we
seek
to
have
this
court
do
two
things.
we
want
the
rather
rigid
principles
of
particularized
need
of
procter
&
gamble
reaffirmed.
secondly,
we
would
like
a
ruling
by
this
court
that
would
indicate
to
the
district
courts
in
the
united
states,
this
court’s
feeling
on
the
proper
form
in
which
a
determination
of
particularized
need
should
be
made.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
this
arises
out
of
a
civil
action.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
they
come
under
the
heading
of
the
miscellaneous
criminal
calendar
as
a
matter
of
nomenclature
and
are
regarded
i
believe
as
being
ancillary
to
the
court’s
jurisdiction
sitting
criminally
in
connection
with
the
grand
jury
investigation.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir,
i
believe
so.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir,
it
is
a
final
decision
which
gave
us
the
right
to
appeal.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
basically,
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
is
the
federal
district
court’s
control
of
what
is
in
fact
an
arm
of
the
judiciary,
the
grand
jury,
and
the
control
which
it
exercises
over
that.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
they
were
not
sir,
intervening
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
no
sir,
this
is
ancillary
to
the
criminal
proceeding,
which
it
had
already
been
completed.
they
had
to
file
in
under
the
miscellaneous
criminal
duty
judge
responsibilities,
because
it
is
regarding
the
central
district
of
california
that
the
criminal
side
of
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
all
matters
relating
to
grand
juries.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
you
are
not
bound
by
it,
but
that
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam
it
is
not
your
honor
as
unorthodox
as
i
wish
it
were.
the
court
that
has
jurisdiction
over
the
documents
normally
has
that
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
an
impounding
order
which
is
issued
at
the
beginning
of
the
grand
jury
which
impounds
the
documents
in
that
district
and
they
may
not
be
removed
from
the
district
without
further
order
of
the
court.
so
the
application
is
to
the
court
and
i
don’t
think
it
makes
much
difference
whether
it
is
regarded
as
the
civil
or
the
criminal
side
of
the
court
but
the
application
is
to
that
court,
which
receive
those
documents
under
an
impounding
order.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir
and
historically
regarded
as
such.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
not
seeking
to
affect
any
kind
of
cover-up
although
there
were
implications
of
that
in
the
proceedings
surrounding
these
documents
and
on
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
respondents
would
not
be
entitled
in
some
measure
to
some
portion
of
the
applicable
transcripts
and
documents
when
and
if
they
could
show
a
legitimate
need
or
requirement
for
them.
they
have
the
whole
panoply
of
the
remedies
available
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
the
concomitant
actions
they
can
take
in
connection
with
their
regular
federal
civil
procedure
document
requests
and
depositions.
they
have
the
concomitant
right
to
appeal
for
the
--
to
a
court
for
the
release
to
them
if
they
can
show
the
proper
cause
of
portions
of
the
grand
jury
transcripts
and
documents.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir,
that
is
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam
i
have
in
mind
the
three
requirements
that
procter
&
gamble
set
forth.
the
requirement
that
they
show
that
the
--
that
which
they
seek
is
useful,
that
which
they
seek
is
relevant
to
the
proceeding,
that
they
show
that
they
will
suffer
prejudice
or
an
injustice
will
be
done
if
they
do
not
get
the
materials
and
third
as
this
court
articulated
in
procter,
a
particularized
need
for
them.
that’s
what
i
mean
by
a
proper
showing
your
honor.
may
i
say
that
few
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
gendered
as
much
dispute
as
procter
&
gamble.
the
federal
district
courts
and
the
circuit
courts
are
in
complete
disagreement
about
almost
every
aspect
of
particularized
need.
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
the
ninth
circuit,
four
judges
of
the
seventh
circuit
as
in
the
clavey
decision
and
many
district
court
judges
in
the
ninth,
seventh,
and
fifth
circuit.
this
group
adheres
to
what
i
refer
to
as
the
slight
need
test
for
the
release
of
grand
jury
documents.
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
dichter
in
the
second
circuit
to
the
contrary
in
baker
versus
united
states
steel,
the
third
circuit
to
the
contrary
in
city
of
philadelphia
versus
westinghouse.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
much
more
need
your
honor,
much
more
need.
you
have
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
bask
decision
adhering
more
to
the
rigid
standard
of
procter
&
gamble.
the
fifth
circuit,
you
have
texas
versus
united
states
steel
and
you
have
four
judges
on
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
clavey
decision
recently
handed
down
by
the
seventh
circuit
is
instructive.
the
issue
was
whether
the
court
had
improperly
--
the
court
below
had
improperly
refused
to
permit
and
accuse
to
obtain
the
transcript
of
his
proceedings.
the
district
court
judge
said
that
it
did
not
acted
improperly
in
refusing
to
give
him
the
transcript.
a
panel
of
the
seventh
circuit
then
upheld
that
on
a
two-to-one
vote,
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
was
granted
thereby
vacating
the
judgment
of
the
panel
and
the
judges
split
four-to-four
on
whether
there
had
been
the
kind
of
particularized
need
under
procter
&
gamble
that
would
have
given
that
criminal
defendant
a
copy
of
his
transcript.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir,
it’s
a
conclusion
that
the
issuance
of
an
indictment
of
transcript
of
all
of
the
proceedings
is
automatically
given
to
counsel
for
the
defendants.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
that
is
nice
in
some
ways
and
it
is
not
nice
in
other
ways.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir
and
that
is
the
practice
in
several
–
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
that
is
correct.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
no
sir,
the
record
does
not
tell
you
i
believe
how
they
got
them,
because
that
did
not
become
an
issue
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
transcripts
were
sought
from
the
government.
let
me
go
back
a
second
sir
to
answer
your
question.
the
respondents
here,
the
plaintiffs
in
the
arizona
court
in
october
of
1976,
filed
a
request
for
the
production
of
transcripts
and
grand
jury
documents
which
were
in
the
hands
of
douglas
and
phillips.
objections
were
made
to
that
production
on
the
grounds
of
relevancy
and
related
issues.
no
objection
was
made
at
that
stage
and
hasn’t
been
made
on
the
grounds
that
the
transcripts
were
released
subject
to
restrictions.
standard
operating
procedures
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam
no
sir,
objection
was
not
made
on
that
ground.
we
did
not
have
the
kind
of
fingerpointing
in
each
direction
that
i
think
plaintiffs
would
believe
we
were
guilty
of.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
no
sir.
there
was
no
trail
of
the
criminal
case,
but
he
had
had
a
judge
gray
was
the
judge
below
who
issued
the
opinion
which
we
are
–
the
ninth
circuit
reviewed
and
which
we
are
requesting
you
to
review
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
aspect
of
any
case.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
he
was
a
miscellaneous
duty
judge
during
that
month
and
it
was
assigned
to
him.
judge
ferguson
first
had
the
case,
judge
malcolm
lucas
do
not
have
the
criminal
case.
judge
pregerson
in
the
central
district
had
the
companion
civil
case.
judge
gray
had
nothing
to
do
with
anyone
of
those
actions.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir,
that’s
correct
and
judge
gray,
whom
we
respect
greatly
and
think
he
is
one
of
the
finest
judges
in
our
district
if
not
the
country.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir,
and
a
pleasure
to
try
a
case
before
him
always.
judge
gray
made
no
bones
of
the
fact
that
he
did
know
anything
at
all
about
this,
but
where
he
went
wrong
we
believe
had
we
have
told
him
this
and
not
succeeded
in
convincing
him
is
in
believing
that
after
the
grand
jury
proceedings
are
concluded,
there
is
a
very
slight
need
for
secrecy.
as
a
practicing
lawyer
who
stamps
the
grapes
in
his
vineyard
regularly,
i
disagree
violently
with
him
with
respect
to
that
and
i
think
that
entire
criminal
bar
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam
no
sir,
the
prosecutor
is
changing
the
position
and
disagreeing
with
me.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
in
this
case
your
honor,
unfortunately
the
government
has
taken
the
position
that
the
transcript
should
be
released
and
i
would
like
if
it
is
appropriate
at
this
time
to
direct
my
remarks
at
that
and
why
in
the
world
is
the
government
take
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir,
i
would
still
say
that
and
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam
it
has
very
little
to
do
with
your
honor
if
the
court
considers
the
nature
of
the
antitrust
complex
litigation
and
the
enormous
significance
that
the
trial
judge
take
hold
of
that
litigation.
the
initial
report
of
the
presidential
commission
on
abusive
discovery
and
remedies
under
the
antitrust
laws
comes
out
very
strongly
with
what
everybody
else
who
had
studied
this
matter
has
come
out
with.
it
is
extremely
important
that
the
trial
judge
take
hold
of
the
litigation.
only
in
that
fashion,
can
you
stop
the
enormous
expense
and
waste
of
time
involved.
you
are
now
faced
with
a
proposed
amendment
to
rule
26,
which
would
require
at
the
request
of
either
party
that
the
trial
judge
hold
an
initial
hearing
and
determine
what
issues
their
discovery
shall
proceed
upon
and
the
order
in
which
discovery
will
proceed.
that
is
for
a
very
good
reason.
there
are
almost
all
ways
in
these
litigations,
standing
questions,
questions
on
whether
the
plaintiff
has
been
injured
under
illinois
brick,
which
is
decidedly
an
issue
in
this
case
as
admitted
on
page
7
of
respondent’s
brief.
it
would
be
folly
to
permit
the
parties
to
engage
in
broad
scale
discovery
we
would
contend
prior
to
a
resolution
of
12(b)(6)
motions,
prior
to
resolution
of
motions
on
standing
and
injury
under
illinois
brick.
that
is
why
the
trial
judge
should
be
in-charge.
you
may
never
reach
these
discovery
issues,
if
the
trial
judge
has
set
the
proper
kind
of
schedule.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
no
sir,
judge
gray
offered
to
call
up
the
trail
judge
and
see
if
they
had
any
objection
to
his
releasing
the
transcripts
and
the
documents.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
informed,
not
the
kind
of
hearing,
which
we
would
want
to
have
had
with
the
trial
judge
to
discuss
all
the
reasons
why
the
transcripts
and
documents
should
not
be
released
at
this
time.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
we
did
make
the
argument
i
am
making
now.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
he
said,
would
you
like
me
to
call
the
trial
judge
and
see
if
he
has
any
objection
to
my
releasing
the
documents.
we
did
not
ask
him
to
make
such
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam
we
did
tell
–
mr.
max
l.
gillam
we
did
tell
judge
gray
that
we
wanted
the
trial
judge
to
decide
it.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
we
did
not
agree
with
him
that
he
should
call
the
trial
judge
to
ask
the
narrow
question
about
that
the
trial
judge
had
any
objection
to
him
releasing
the
transcripts
and
the
documents.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
we
have
an
individual
calendar
in
the
central
district
of
california.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
they
also
have
individual
assignments
to
individual
judges.
it
would
be
a
very
different
situation
your
honor
if
we
had
a
master
calendar
situation
but
most
of
the
federal
districts
in
which
i
practice
–
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir,
the
individual
calendar
and
that
is
both
that
way
in
arizona
and
in
the
central
district
of
california
and
i
believe
in
most
districts
around
the
country
i
have
practiced
in
most
jurisdictions.
and
these
antitrust
cases,
even
if
there
is
a
master
calendar
situation
are
assigned
to
one
judge
for
all
purposes;
you
can
not
have
the
different
judge
ruling
on
it
every
month.
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white
if
i
may
who
asked
me
about
the
government.
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
white,
i
may
be
confused.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
and
you
asked
me
if
we
were
not
in
fact
opposed
to
the
government
here.
i
would
prefer
to
state
that
we
are
fighting
the
government’s
fight
here
because
they
are
not
willing
to
and
i
think
that
is
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
sir?
mr.
max
l.
gillam
this
is
the
position
they
have
taken
and
i
do
not
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
they
have
taken
it
honestly.
i
think
they
have
taken
it
mistakenly
and
i
think
they
have
taken
it
for
three
reasons,
they
have
taken
it
mistakenly.
first
of
all,
i
do
not
think
the
government
really
understands
the
significance
to
the
individual
witness
going
into
a
grand
jury
of
his
knowledge
that
it
is
only
under
the
most
egregious
circumstances
that
his
transcript
will
be
released.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
but
not
representing
many
defendants
your
honor
in
this
case.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir,
they
certainly
have.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
they
are
feeling
that
chill.
the
change
in
the
government’s
position
has
not
been
initiated
in
this
case.
it
has
been
a
gradual
change
in
the
government’s
position
with
respect
to
the
secrecy
of
grand
jury
proceedings.
it
almost
coincided
with
the
semi-national
scandal
involving
dita
beard
and
itt.
it
was
augmented
by
the
watergate
situation
and
the
fear
of
government
prosecutors
that
the
world
would
think
that
they
had
been
guilty
of
a
cover-up.
in
fact
in
this
case,
the
accusation
basically
of
a
cover-up
was
made
by
the
former
antitrust
division
attorney
who
had
left
the
office
six
months
before
the
indictment
came
down.
these
are
the
jonathan
p
nave
affidavits,
which
were
attached
as
exhibits
to
the
motion
to
supplement
the
appeal
in
the
ninth
circuit
supplement
the
record
by
respondents
and
which
per
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
it
considered
in
making
its
ruling.
there
are
pages
26
through
42
of
the
appendix.
the
former
person
in
the
government
mr.
nave
stated
that
his
attention
had
been
drawn
to
the
portion
of
the
competitive
impact
statement
filed
in
the
civil
case
which
said
"since
the
government
did
not
develop
evidence
price
fixing
with
respect
to
gasoline,
other
than
rebrand
gasoline
basically"
this
is
the
only
the
reason
the
rebrand
gasoline
alone
was
involved
in
the
indictment.
mr.
nave
filed
an
affidavit
in
camera
together
with
his
statement
about
that
portion
of
the
competitive
impact
statement.
at
the
direction
of
the
judge
pregerson,
he
then
filed
the
second
affidavit
which
is
contained
in
the
appendix
at
approximately
the
page
number
i
mentioned,
approximately
page
30,
in
which
he
while
not
referring
to
specific
companies,
gave
five
lines
of
inquiry
that
he
knew
from
having
conducted
the
portion
of
the
grand
jury
until
september
of
1974.
he
gave
the
leads
which
the
government
had
but
as
to
which
no
indictment
had
come
down.
retail
price
fixing,
no
indictment
came
down,
no
one
was
accused.
this
retail
price
fixing
under
his
affidavit
included
an
alleged
pipeline
right
into
the
executive
office
of
the
white
house.
second,
use
of
exchange
agreements
to
deny
supplied
independence,
no
indictment
was
ever
handed
down
for
that.
third,
collusive
action
they
would
like
to
deny
import"
no
indictment
as
to
that.
fourth,
collusion
to
eliminate
cross
hauling
and
fifth
collusion
to
include
the
price
of
credit
cards
in
the
sale
of
crude
oil
so
that
independents,
who
did
not
have
their
own
crude
oil
supply
could
not
compete.
this
charge
was
basically
a
charge
to
cover-up
by
a
former
man
in
the
division.
i
think
it
has
made
the
government
understandably
very
sensible
about
taking
any
kind
of
position
against
disclosure
of
any
transcript
involved
in
these
grand
juries
but
may
i
say
to
this
court
the
very
act
of
a
former
attorney
for
the
antitrust
division
in
filing
in
this
kind
of
affidavit
is
i
believe
a
violation
of
rule
6(e).
it
certainly
discloses
crimes
as
to
which
there
was
no
indictment.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
i
can
only
refer
you
sir
to
the
language
of
its
first
affidavit
in
which
he
said
he
had
been
contacted
by
counsel
for
petrol
stops
and
gas-a-tron,
the
respondents
herein
and
had
been
asked
to
comment
on
the
competitive
impact
statement
of
the
government.
this
is
necessary
tunney
act
as
the
court
knows.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
oh
yes
sir,
it
was
certainly
not
filed
at
my
behest
or
at
our
behest.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
few
minutes
i
have
remaining
if
i
may.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hope
i
will
not
be
required
to
utilize
the
time
i
have
remaining.
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
the
weakness
of
the
government’s
position
in
this
regard.
historically,
the
better
practice
has
been
for
the
trial
judge
to
believe
that
he
would
need
the
grand
jury
materials
and
to
ask
the
grand
jury
district
judge
to
forward
them
to
him.
in
baker
versus
united
states
steel,
pending
to
the
district
of
connecticut,
judge
newman
came
with
the
conclusion
that
portions
of
the
grand
jury
materials
might
be
relevant
and
he
requested
judge
white
who
was
the
titular
custodian
of
those
documents
to
transmit
the
grand
jury
materials
to
the
district
of
connecticut
so
that
judge
newman
could
review
them
and
see
whether
there
was
a
particularized
need
for
the
disclosure.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
my
standard
on
particularized
need
sir
is
that
it
must
be
relevant
and
useful
to
litigation.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
no
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
that’s
for
the
first
point.
the
second
one
is
that
the
failure
to
obtain
it
would
render
an
injustice
of
some
kind
such
as
the
materials
not
being
available
anywhere
else.
and
the
third
matter
is
that
there
is
a
particularized
need
in
this
litigation
to
refresh
the
recollection
of
a
witness
who
has
said
he
doesn’t
remember
now
but
when
he
has
transcript,
when
he
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
four
years
ago,
his
memory
was
a
lot
better
and
he
was
sure
that
if
he
could
look
at
that
transcript,
it
would
refresh
his
recollection.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir,
and
may
i
say
that’s
apart.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
it
would
never
be
enough.
it
would
never
be
enough,
but
please
don’t
you
see
how
these
two
issues
are
hand
and
glove.
you
can’t
decide
one
without
deciding
the
other.
if
there
is
nothing
to
particularized
need,
who
cares
what
court
makes
a
determination.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
that’s
highly
likely
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
cannot
envision
a
situation
whereas
here
in
advanced
of
the
taking
of
any
depositions
or
any
testimony,
there
would
be
a
particularized
need
for
a
wholesale
disclosure
of
a
grand
jury
transcript
to
enable
the
plaintiff
to
refresh
the
recollection
of
a
witness
who
has
not
yet
indicated,
he
need
is
recollection
refresh
or
to
impeach
him
when
there
is
no
evidence
that
at
this
stage,
there
was
any
impeaching
material
in
the
grand
jury
transcript.
these
are
one
thing,
this
particularized
need
question
and
which
court
should
do
the
ruling,
they
are
not
different.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
they
had
not
been
returned
at
the
time
the
rule
34
request
was
made
for
production
in
arizona.
so
we
discovered
at
that
time
and
i
think
the
government
did
that
we
had
not
returned
them
at
the
close
of
the
criminal
case.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
no
sir,
we
were
embroiled
so
in
the
tunney
act
hearing
in
an
attempt
to
get
a
consent
judgment
in
the
civil
companion
case,
where
the
charges
of
cover-up
and
what
have
you
that
i
think
it
just
slipped
the
government’s
mind
and
it
slipped
ours.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
well,
it’s
not
true
here
now
because
we
don’t
know
what
witnesses
are
going
to
be
at
the
time
the
district
court
rule.
we
didn’t
know,
he
didn’t
know,
what
witnesses
would
be
deposed,
whether
they
would
ever
be
deposed,
whether
they
would
ever
testify?
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir
but
please
i
have
not
succeeded
in
at
least
one
aspect
of
what
i
am
attempting
to
do
today.
this
--
the
record
shows
that
this
antitrust
investigation
was
like
almost
all
antitrust
investigation.
it
considered
exchange
agreements,
it
considered
alleged
collusive
restrictions
in
crude
oil
purchases,
it
considered
alleged
collusions
in
cross-hauling,
it
considered
retail
price
fixing
none
of
which
was
involved
in
the
indictment.
the
disclosure
of
an
entire
transcript
of
a
witness
does
indeed
as
mr.
justice
brennan
stated
in
pittsburg
glass,
disclosed
derogatory
information
presented
to
a
grand
jury
against
an
accused
who
has
not
been
indicted
for
this.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
the
exact
way
that
judge
newman
went
about
it
in
baker
versus
united
state
steel.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
no,
no,
he
had
the
criminal
judge
sent
him
--
i
am
sorry,
judge
newman
was
the
trial
judge,
sent
him
the
transcript
and
he
went
through
it
and
excised
those
portions
which
were
highly
irrelevant.
judge
clary
in
city
of
philadelphia
versus
westinghouse
directed
the
copies
of
the
transcripts
go
out
to
the
deposition
judges
in
the
varying
districts
so
that
they
could
determine
what
portions
of
these
should
be
disclosed,
but
he
himself
with
a
key
witness
came
to
the
conclusion
that,
that
particular
witness’s
transcript
should
not
go
out
of
his
desk.
he
was
the
trial
judge.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
no
sir,
we
have
never
had
an
opportunity
to
discuss
this
particular
thing
with
the
trial
judge.
our
only
argument
in
--
mr.
max
l.
gillam
that’s
right,
the
criminal
duty
judge?
mr.
max
l.
gillam
no
sir.
we
did
not
suggest
to
him
that
he
go
through
an
excise
out
irrelevant
portions
that
would
have
been
and
exercise
in
futility.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
yes
sir,
because
he
is
the
one,
he
has
assigned
to
that
case
and
he
knows
what’s
relevant
to
it.
the
criminal
duty
judge
in
los
angeles
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
read
the
transcript.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
a
rule
34
request
is
not
self-executing.
you
request
documents,
objection
was
made
to
the
production
of
the
grand
jury
transcripts
and
documents
on
the
grounds
of
relevancy
and
related
grounds.
the
plaintiffs
petrol
stops
gas-a-tron
did
not
elect
to
press
with
a
rule
37
motion,
which
is
required
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
sir,
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
max
l.
gillam
it
is
sitting
there.
