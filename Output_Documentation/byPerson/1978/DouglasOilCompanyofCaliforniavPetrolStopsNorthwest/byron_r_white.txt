justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
contrary,
no
need
or
much
more
need?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
disagreeing
with
the
prosecutor
too
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
disagreeing
with
the
federal
antitrust
prosecutor.
justice
byron
r.
white
before
you
leave
the
question
of
which,
i
think
you
are
telling
me
which
judge
is
the
right
one
to
say
these
issues.
you
made
the
point
that
judge
gray
had
little
familiarity
with
the
case.
as
i
understand
your
legal
argument,
you
would
make
precisely
the
same
legal
argument
if
there
had
been
a
full
criminal
trial
that
which
judge
gray
had
presided,
you
would
still
say
the
case
should
be
decided
by
the
judge
in
the
place
where
the
treble-damage
action
is
filed.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
particular,
the
question
whether
judge
gray
knew
very
much
about
the
case
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
for
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
this
case,
didn’t
judge
gray
call
up
the
trail
judge
and
ask
him
whether
he
thought
(voice
overlap)
go
ahead
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
not
you
at
that
point
make
the
very
argument
you
are
making
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
that
he
asked
you
whether
you
should
call
a
trial
judge
and
you
said
don’t
bother.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
answer,
what
you
have
been
saying
very
persuasively
after
now
as
you
very
violently
wanted
the
other
trial
judge
to
decide
it,
why
would
not
you
tell
judge
gray
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
telling
judge
gray
would
know
all
the
issues
about
your
case
so
as
the
trial
judge
in
arizona.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
did,
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
did
not
need
to
file.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
not
need
to
take
this
position
that
they
have.
i
take
it,
i
take
it,
they
have
taken
it
honestly
that
they
think
that
is
a
proper
rule
of
law
that
will
release
these
minutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
their
partners
have
been
in
the
criminal
prosecution
business
a
long
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
they
have
been
calling
a
lot
of
witnesses.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
they
would
feel
the
first
chill
of
their
--
the
first
chilly
wind
on
witnesses
they
would
feel.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
transcripts
already
in
possession
of
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly
would
not
reach
documents
that
they
had,
that
they
had
given
to
the
grand
jury,
those
would
not
be
submitted
to
the
grand
jury
secrecy,
will
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
all
that
defendant
has
to
do
to
make
secret
documents
is
to
given
to
a
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
did
but
your
rule
34
did
talk
out
from
the
defendants.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
were
those
producible?
why
should
not
you
appeal
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
have
curtailed
on
your
rule
34
motion,
you
would
have
had
him
on
an
unrestricted
basis,
i
would
suggest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
--
as
to
whom,
you
can
disclose
them
i
would
not
that
may
be
so
but
you
should
have
put
through
them
too
in
the
trials
in
other
matter.
you
did
not
object
to
that
restriction.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn’t
it
true
mr.
berman
that
the
clayton
act
provides
that
if
the
plea
of
nolos
entered
by
the
defendants
that
protects
them
from
the
risk
of
the
judgment
being,
prima
facie
evidence
against
them,
and
does
not
that
indicate
some
expression
of
confessional
policy
to
encourage
defendants
to
plead
nolo
so
that
the
government
litigation
won’t
be
useful
against
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
will
also
ask
you
again,
what
about
the
documents?
let
us
suppose
they
were
--
to
the
extent
they
were
involved
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
we
want
to
pursue
the
answer
to
the
question.
what
else
besides
relevance
does
the
government
agree
must
be
shown
to
the
criminal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
haven’t
really
formulated
your
own
standard
for
this,
isn’t
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
standard
on
particularized
need?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
alrightr.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
in
no
case
would
just
the
plaintiff’s
desire
to
save
himself
expands
the
time
and
trouble
of
deposing
those
same
witnesses
would
be
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
sir,
you
mean,
it
would
never
be
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
you
would
make
the
plaintiff,
you
would
say
the
plaintiff
must
be
taking
a
deposition
and
find
out
that
he
really
does
need
the
materials?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gillam,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
just
makes
just
a
little
difference
in
some
cases
and
mr.
beale
adverted
to,
--
is
it
correct
that
there
was
an
order
outstanding
that
required
you
to
return
the
transcripts?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
but
did
you
comply
to
that
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
they
will
say,
no
we
thought
it
was
very
important
once
the
case
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
it
might
make
a
difference
if
the
time
(inaudible)
take
depositions
if
the
witness
has
a
lapse
in
memory
repeatedly
within
that
particularized
need,
something
like
that.
it
might
make
a
difference,
so
if
you
are
able
to
prepare
the
witness
with
the
grand
jury
transcript,
perhaps
in
that
case,
it
was
somewhat
a
little
bit
on
one-sided
to
say
that
they
should
not
had
access
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
not
true
here
now
as
i
understand,
you
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose,
part
of
it
is,
one
witness
leads
to
another
and
the
government
finds
out
which
people
are
involved
and
then
they
know
which
witnesses
to
interrogate
and
the
plaintiff
may
not
know
those
names
when
he
starts
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
are
saying
is
that
part
of
the
transcript
would
fairly
clearly
be
irrelevant,
or
partly
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
do
you
find
out
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
had
the
trial
judge
read
the
transcript?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gillam,
in
this
case,
you
objected
any
disclosure,
did
you
also
alternatively
suggested
the
trial
judge
that
he
should
edit
the
transcripts
and
edit
out
the
material
that
you
would
say
was
prejudicial.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
trial
judge
in
san
francisco
whoever
was
in
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
your
submission
that
that
function
is
for
the
judge
in
arizona.
