ms.
sara
s.
beale
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
although
the
united
states
does
not
oppose
disclosure
in
this
case,
it
has
a
vital
interest
as
prosecutor
in
preserving
the
traditional
secrecy
of
grand
jury
proceedings
and
we
do
not
believe
our
position
in
this
case
is
in
anyway
inconsistent
with
that
interest.
as
the
briefs
of
the
parties
made
clear,
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
do
not
revamp
the
questions
presented
here,
they
do
not
designate
which
court
should
rule
whether
disclosure
should
be
permitted
nor
do
they
specify
what
showing
is
required
in
order
to
warn
disclosure
in
particular
proceedings.
the
government
submits
that
the
ultimate
authority
to
disclose
grand
jury
materials
must
trust
in
each
case
in
the
district
court
in
which
the
grand
jury
was
convened
and
further
that
the
grand
jury
court
in
this
case
properly
permitted
disclosure
based
upon
a
finding
that
there
was
a
particularized
need
that
outweighed
the
considerations
in
favor
of
continued
secrecy.
it
is
petitioner’s
contention
that
the
arizona
civil
court
rather
than
the
grand
jury
court
was
in
the
best
position
to
make
a
certiorari
and
examination
of
particularized
need.
and
they
urge
that
because
the
arizona
court
and
they
urge
that
the
arizona
court
had
jurisdiction
to
order
disclosure
because
petitioners
who
were
parties,
over
whom
that
court
had
jurisdiction
had
in
their
possession
copies
of
the
grand
jury
transcripts
of
the
testimony
given
by
their
employees.
in
our
brief,
we
discuss
what
we
believe
to
be
the
general
reasons
why
the
grand
jury
court
and
not
the
civil
court
should
ultimately
rule
on
a
propriety
of
disclosure
in
each
case,
but
we
think
then
in
this
case,
the
court
need
not
reach
these
more
general
considerations
because
the
facts
here
make
it
clear
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
arizona
civil
court
to
authorize
disclosure
by
directing
the
petitioners
here
to
reveal
to
respondents
the
copies
of
the
grand
jury
transcripts
that
petitioners
had
in
their
possession.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
think
perhaps
these
facts
here
do
not
present
a
more
general
issue
for
reason
that
unfortunately
is
not
discussed
in
the
briefs
of
the
parties.
in
reviewing
the
records
of
the
grand
jury
court,
we
discover
that
the
order,
the
original
order
authorizing
disclosure
to
the
plaintiffs
here
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
we
are
a
party.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
yes
we
are.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
two
petitioners
did
not
commit
them
to
retain
the
grand
jury
transcripts
once
they
had
tendered
their
plea
of
nolo
contendere.
and
that
order
would
be
violated
by
any
use
of
the
transcripts
in
the
arizona
civil
proceedings.
the
california
court’s
order
which
was
filed
in
july
of
1975
authorized
disclosure
under
rule
16
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
the
sole
purpose
of
the
preparation
of
petitioner’s
defense
to
the
criminal
antitrust
charges.
that
order
also
required
petitioners
to
keep
the
transcripts
otherwise
confidential
and
to
return
them
to
the
department
of
justice
when
the
criminal
antitrust
case
was
concluded.
that
order
has
been
neither
amended
nor
modified
in
pertinent
part.
had
the
petitioners
return
the
grand
jury
transcripts
as
they
were
required
to
do
by
the
terms
of
the
california
court’s
order,
they
would
not
have
had
those
documents
in
their
possession
at
the
time
that
the
respondents
first
requested
discovery
of
those
documents.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
the
documents
as
we
understand
it
really
are
not
the
focus
of
the
petition
at
this
point.
they
were
discussed
in
the
court
below.
in
fact
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
the
documents
were
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
arizona
court
and
they
were
not
i
think
subject
to
the
same
concerns
of
grand
jury
secrecy
because
they
were
thought
to
see
what
those
documents
said
and
not
to
learn
what
the
grand
jury
was
saying
in
that.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
the
california
rule
6
provides
that
as
counsel
read
it
that
disclosure
may
be
made
preliminary
to
or
in
connection
with
judicial
proceedings.
we
think
quite
properly
that
respondents
who
wish
to
have
disclosure
made
of
the
documents,
which
the
court
certainly
retained
jurisdiction
over
in
the
criminal
case
permitted
the
california
court
to
authorize
if
it
determined
it
was
proper,
that
disclosure
should
be
made
by
the
government
to
find
this.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
we
would
view
this
as
a
continuation
of
the
criminal
proceedings
and
we
have
so
suggested
and
that
is
one
reason
that
we
believe
petitioners
who
are
the
defendants
in
that
case
are
properly
parties
although
there
was
no
official
order
permitting
them
to
intervene
here.
we
think
that
the
criminal
courts,
jurisdiction
over
this
case
permitted
it
to
take
its
own
records
at
the
request
of
a
party
who
came
before
the
court
and
ordered
their
disclosure
under
rule
6.
now
of
course
if
they
have
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
it
was
not
until
it
came
before
the
court
and
filed
a
petition
requesting
disclosure
which
we
would
think
is
authorized
by
rule
6
and
rule
6
seems
in
our
view
to
clearly
permit
that.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
do
not
know
that
i
would
want
to
make
such
a
broad
statement.
i
would
think
that
it
is
a
statutory
matter
and
that
they
may
help
in
designing
what
causes
of
action
or
what
authority
the
court
might
exercise
but
it
does
seem
clear
that
the
criminal
case
was
properly
in
the
california
court,
there
is
no
question
of
that.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
they
were
not
parties
to
the
original
criminal
case,
that’s
correct.
there
were
a
number
of
defendants
including
petitioners
and
not
including
respondents
who
filed
disclosure.
but
they
came
in
and
requested
from
the
custodian
of
the
documents
that
they
be
turned
over
and
showed
what
we
view
required
standard
of
particularized
need
and
that
the
considerations
of
secrecy
were
not
outweighed.
in
addition,
in
view
of
the
fact
of
california
court’s
order,
specifically
limited
the
use
of
the
transcripts
to
the
preparation
of
the
defense
in
a
criminal
trial.
we
think
it
is
clear
to
hand
the
arizona
court
purported
to
permit
the
use
of
those
copies
of
the
documents
for
in
the
civil
case
that
could
not
have
done
so
without
first
modifying
the
restrictions
of
the
california
courts
order.
it
seems
crystal
clear
to
us
that
kind
of
interference
with
the
order
of
the
california
court’s
order
could
not
possibly
be
proper
and
that
this
case
is
certainly
not
one
where
in
the
civil
court
could
properly
have
exercised
jurisdiction.
once
the
california
court
look
in
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
think
in
a
proper
case
that
would
be
possible
either
for
the
criminal
court
to
conclude
that
the
reasons
of
secrecy
might
permit
disclosure
but
that
it
cannot
evaluate
particularized
need
and
refer
the
matter
over
to
the
civil
court
or
i
will
turn
it
to
the
civil
court
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
i
think
that’s
right.
in
a
closed
case,
the
criminal
court
may
well
conclude
that
the
grand
jury
court
that
it
is
not
able
to
ascertain
whether
there
will
be
a
particularized
need.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
we
do
think
that
it
is
very
important
that
the
court
that
has
familiarity
with
the
records
in
the
criminal
case
with
the
particular
concerns,
the
court
in
which
the
local
prosecutors
have
appeared
and
the
only
single
court,
which
could
resolve
all
of
these
matters
should
in
the
first
instance
and
must
ultimately
in
every
instance
be
consulted
and
give
its
approval
for
disclosure.
now,
it
may
well
be
the
case.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
think
that
is
quite
right,
in
particular
cases
that
will
vary
how
much
familiarity
the
individual
judge
has
but
one
of
the
concerns
that
we
have
is
how
easy
will
it
be
for
the
court
to
determine
what
the
most
important
considerations
in
favor
of
secrecy
or
continued
secrecy
are.
if
it’s
the
court
in
which
the
criminal
proceedings
have
been
conducted
where
the
grand
jury
have,
the
entire
record
will
be
available
there,
not
just
bits
and
pieces,
not
just
the
transcripts
which
these
petitioners
happened
to
have
disclosed
to
them,
which
may
not
give
the
whole
picture.
the
local
prosecutors
who
have
conducted
the
grand
jury
who
will
know
where
their
further
proceedings
are
contemplated,
who
will
know
if
particular
witnesses
were
extremely
reluctant
and
feared
that
their
statements
might
be
unnecessarily
made
available
to
certain
parties,
all
that
information
is
most
readily
available
in
the
court
where
the
grand
jury
proceedings
were
conducted.
and
we
believe
that
in
many
cases
and
this
case
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
ability
of
the
grand
jury
court
to
determine
has
the
person
requesting
disclosure
comes
forward
with
a
sufficient
showing
of
particularized
need.
it
is
not
a
case
we
think
where
it
is
the
court’s
duty
to
go
through
all
of
the
records
and
determine
whether
there
might
be
some
conceivable
way
in
which
the
documents
can
be
used.
the
person
seeking
disclosure,
the
respondents
here,
came
for
we
believe
with
quite
a
plain
showing
of
particularized
need
and
the
government
which
despite
petitioner’s
disagreement
is
indeed
concerned
with
the
question
whether
there
is
a
continued
need
for
secrecy,
took
into
account
not
only
the
question
whether
they
had
been
showing
a
particularized
need,
but
whether
there
is
a
reason
for
continued
secrecy.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
think
then
we
have
to
determine
what
proceeding
should
be
the
norm
and
we
don’t
disagree
that
in
cases
where
the
criminal
court
determines
that
it
cannot
make
by
itself
a
determination
and
why
this
sufficient
showing
of
need
has
been
made
that
it
might
refer
the
matter
over
to
the
civil
court.
we
think
this
is
not
such
a
case,
and
we
think
that
a
rule
of
bifurcation
go
first
to
the
criminal
court,
then
to
the
civil
court,
a
setting
line
up
is
a
necessity
in
cases
where
the
criminal
court
is
perfectly
well
able
to
determine
when
the
disclosure
can
be
made
would
simply
stretch
these
proceedings
out
in
ways
judicial
resources.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
think
that,
we
do
feel
that
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
don’t
think
that
is
quite
our
opposition,
although
i
will
say
that
we
think
the
less
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
i
think
that
i
would
say
that
what
was
shown
here
is
far
more
than
relevance.
if
one
can
show
that
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
i
think
it
is
more
than
simply
relevance.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
pardon
me.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
think
if
it
is
relevant
and
you
can’t
get
it
anywhere
else,
that
is
certainly
particularized
need
but
whether
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
think
it
is
difficult
to
formulate.
the
courts
use
a
lot
of
different
terms,
compelling
need,
inability
to
get
the
materials
outwear,
i
don’t
know
that.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
i
don’t
know
that
we
can
formulate
it
anymore
clearly
than
it.
'we’ve
found
the
standards
in
the
court’s
prior
cases
to
be
satisfactory
and
parties
do
disagree
in
giving
cases
the
application
of
those
standards
particularized
need,
compelling
need
to
a
given
case.
we
think
that
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
the
plaintiffs
here
and
the
showing
that
we
found
sufficient
was
the
showing
that
the
answers
that
the
defendants
had
made
in
different
context.
petitioners
here
were
conflicting
and
that
the
best
way
of
testing
their
statements
and
to
either
refresh
the
recollection
of
your
witnesses
or
to
possibly
impeach
statements
which
might
be
untruthful
would
be
by
showing
inconsistency
of
those
statements
under
or
before
the
grand
jury.
we
think
that,
that
goes
beyond
relevance.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
i
am
sorry.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
we
do
think
that
the
best
place
for
all
the
considerations
of
secrecy
to
be
taken
to
account
is
the
court
where
the
grand
jury
sat,
where
the
criminal
proceedings
if
any
took
place,
where
the
local
prosecutors
are
available,
where
all
of
the
criminal
records
are
available,
all
of
the
criminal
records
are
not
available
in
a
civil
district
and
indeed
there
may
be
many
such
civil
districts,
where
materials
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
think
that
our
only
answer
would
have
to
be
or
our
best
answer
would
be
that
there
is
a
possibility
for
those
judges
to
be
familiar
with
the
local
circumstances,
with
the
parties
to
have
before
them
the
prosecutor
and
indeed
i
suppose
that
one
could
well
first
sent
from
the
repository
to
the
arizona
court.
then
to
the
montana
court,
then
to
another
court,
but
we
think
it
more
official
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
in
fact
there
is
a
local
office
at
the
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
no
sir,
there
is
a
local
office
at
the
antitrust
division
in
los
angeles
and
that
was
the
office
that
handle
this
case.
so
in
fact
the
personnel
of
that
office
were
and
the
person
in
charge
of
that
case
was
the
one
who
came
to
this
hearing
on
the
disclosure
here,
but
certainly
in
many
--
ms.
sara
s.
beale
well,
i
would
not
disagree
with
that
for
a
moment.
ms.
sara
s.
beale
usually,
often.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
so
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
