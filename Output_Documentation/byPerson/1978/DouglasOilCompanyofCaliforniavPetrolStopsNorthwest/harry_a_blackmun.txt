isnâ€™t
there
an
intermediate
position
though,
even
if
you
are
quite
correct
that
the
arizona
court
could
not
really
affect
the
release
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
without
the
cooperation
of
the
california
court.
the
intermediate
position
is
why
should
not
the
california
court
be
asked
to
release
them
to
the
extent
that
the
arizona
court
finds
them
relevant
and
otherwise
disposable
under
rule
34
are
in
a
deposition?

because
the
criminal
court
might
order
the
release
of
documents
that
were
submitted
to
the
grand
jury
that
the
court
in
arizona
would
never
have
order
turned
over.
justice

that's
what
i
am
suggesting,
why
should
not
it
be
the
general
rule
that
the
california
court
or
the
criminal
court
defer,
just
lift
the
secrecy
order
to
the
extent
that

justice
harry

well,
as
i
read
your
brief,
that
has
been
the
--
that
particularized
need
in
the
context
of
a
treble-damage
suit
by
a
plaintiff
who
wants
the
grand
jury
minutes;
it
is
enough
to
show
relevance.
