justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gillam,
in
this
case
as
i
remember
is
that
you
do
have
the
transcripts,
the
defendants
have
the
transcripts
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
record
tell
us
how
they
got
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
objection
made
on
the
ground
that
the
proper
remedy
was
in
the
other
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
you
had
and
the
court
had
the
rule
against
you
on
the
grounds
of
these
documents
completely
irrelevant
to
anything
he
can
imagine
would
arise
in
this
case.
would
you
--
i
suppose
your
position
would
be
that
you
could
still
get
them
from
the
california
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
you
do
not
want
in
the
--
who
pays
for
the
copies
of
the
documents?
in
the
california
court,
suppose
the
judge
--
say
the
judge
rules
in
your
favor,
which
he
did,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
relief
you
would
have
got
when
the
documents
just
been
turned
over
to
you,
would
you
have
had
to
copy
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
explain
to
me
why
the
restrictions
were
put
on?
i
assume
that
some
of
these
grand
jury
witnesses
were
employees
of
defendants
or
were
all
of
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
wouldn’t
any
of
those
employees
state
out
of
court
statements
be,
wouldn’t
they
ever
qualify
as
admissions
of
a
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
only
made
to
the
grand
jury,
but
nevertheless
they
were
statements
of
fact
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
the
defendant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
they
restrict,
why
would
not
they
be
admissible
in
your
case
in
chief
as
an
admission
of
a
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
not
you
object
to
that
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
would
have
thought
they
will
be
much
more
used
to
you
as
a,
you
know,
on
unrestricted
basis
and
an
admissible
in
your
case
in
chief.
