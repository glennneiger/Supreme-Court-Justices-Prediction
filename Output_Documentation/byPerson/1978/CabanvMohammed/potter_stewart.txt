justice
potter
stewart
now,
if
these
children
were
going
to
be
adopted
into
either
family,
that
is,
the
new
family,
that
is
that
of
the
natural
father
and
his
new
wife
or
that
of
the
natural
mother
and
her
new
husband.
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
was
going
to
be
any
adoption
at
all
as
between
those,
the
rights
of
one
of
the
natural
parents
were
going
to
be
terminated
in
the
drastic
and
dramatic
way
you’ve
just
described,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
event
an
adoption
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
either
side,
and
the
rights
one
of
the
natural
parents
are
going
to
be
terminated
in
just
the
complete
and
dramatic
way
you
describe,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
wouldn’t
your
--
i
think
the
--
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
logical
consequence
of
your
argument
would
be
that
the
only
affair
and
indeed
the
only
constitutional
thing
to
do
in
a
situation
such
as
this
one
is
not
to
have
any
adoption
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
what
the
statute
clearly
provides,
doesn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
accurate
in
that
statement
insofar
as
he
was
reciting
then
law
of
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
mthat
was
not
an
adoption
case
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
mother
was
deceased
as
i
remember.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
the
matter
of
the
custody
rights
as
the
natural
father
vis-à-vis
the
custody
rights
of
the
state
--
institutionalizing
him
under
the
agency
of
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
wrong
in
my
recollection?
justice
potter
stewart
custodial
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
not
an
adoption
case,
you
would
agree
with
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
natural
mother
was
dead.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
also
correct.
i
am
relying
on
my
recollection.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
point
is
in
stanley,
you
didn’t
have
a
competition
between
the
two
because
the
mother
was
dead.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
the
competition
in
stanley
was
first
of
all
not
for
adoption
at
all,
at
least
at
that
stage,
simply
for
custody
and
secondly
between
the
natural
father,
who
had
not
only
sired
but
raised
the
children
on
the
hand
and
the
state
on
the
other.
that’s
correct,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
true
mr.
silk,
isn’t
it,
and
i
think
perhaps
i
am
repeating
the
question
i
asked
at
the
outset
that
if
you’re
correct,
it
would
follow
that
at
least
in
the
situation
that
you
alleged
this
situation
to
be,
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
would
absolutely
prohibit
and
prevent
the
possibility
of
any
adoption
of
these
children,
by
anybody.
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
that,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you
are
correct
in
your
constitutional
claim,
wouldn’t
it
follow
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
would
prevent
the
adoption
of
these
children
by
anybody
so
long
as
you
and
your
opponents
remain
in
a
litigating
posture.
now,
if
you
decide
to
settle
it
and
one
of
you
--
one
of
the
other
decides
not
to
litigate,
of
course,
the
case
would
change.
doesn’t
that
follow,
necessarily?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
an
adoption
you’ve
told
us
inevitably
does.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
few
people
had
agreed
on
this
matter,
this
wouldn’t
be
a
--
ever
been
a
lawsuit
and
this
case
wouldn’t
be
here,
i
am
assuming
that
you
are
going
to
be
litigating
it,
and
that
you
are
not
change
your
position
and
that
your
adversaries
not
either.
justice
potter
stewart
with
visitation
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
be
your
view
if
you
had
an
infant,
two
or
three
weeks
old
or
two
or
three
months
old,
just
old
enough
to
be
put
out
for
adoption?
would
you
take
the
view
and
so
the
no
permanent
relationship
really
could
have
formed
yet
between
the
natural
father
and
the
infant,
and
in
that
context
would
you
say
the
natural
father
has
an
absolute
detail
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right?
justice
potter
stewart
if
he’s
the
natural
father
and
he
paid
the
hospital
bills
and
he
objected
to
the
person
to
whom
the
mother
wants
to
place
the
child
for
adoption,
does
he
have
a
constitutional
right?
justice
potter
stewart
he
just
doesn’t
want
--
he
doesn’t
want
the
adoption
to
be
placed
for
that
particular
person.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
talking
about
looking
after
his
interest,
i
just
said
he
have
a
standing,
does
he
have
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
object,
and
your
answer
is
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
terms
and
conditions
of
section
6
apply.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
a
two-step
process.
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
step
would
be
one
of
the
dispensing
conditions.
justice
potter
stewart
that
might
have
been
because
they
thought
that
despite
their
previous
dissent,
the
law
of
new
york
was
now
established.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
schulslaper
do
you
think
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
this
court
to
go
into
the
all
of
those
facts
going
to
the
substantiality
of
the
husband’s
interest
in
his
children,
maybe
under
quilloin
it
does,
but
that
means
that
the
--
that
under
the
constitution
we
are
required
to
more
or
less
act
as
a
domestic
relations
court,
which
i
wonder
if
many
of
my
colleagues
signed
on
for
when
they
accepted
their
commissions.
