justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
you
a
minute?
i
missed
something
in
the
statute
somewhere
because,
you’re
talking
a
great
deal
about
the
relationship
of
the
father
to
the
child.
does
the
statute
say
anything
about
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
would
the
situation
under
the
statue
be
if
neither
parent
had
any
relationship
with
the
child
at
the
time?
let’s
suppose
they
both
dissuaded
the
child
and
it
turned
out
that
somebody
wanted
to
come
along
and
adopt,
wouldn’t
the
mother
have
a
veto
right
under
the
new
york
statute
that
even
though
she
hadn’t
seen
the
child
for
ten
years?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
statute
say
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
it
does.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
this
case,
relationship
is
really
immaterial
except
a
sort
of
back
ground,
isn’t
it?
neither
of
these
parents
had
abandoned
their
child.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
silk,
may
i
ask
you
somewhat
related
question?
would
you
be
satisfied
if
the
new
york
law
were
amended
to
provide
equal
rights
for
both
the
mother
and
the
father
and
the
rights
essentially
said
that
neither
had
an
absolute
right
to
veto
an
adoption
each
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing,
and
the
decision
would
turn
on
what
was
found
to
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
would
meet
your
equal
protection
issue,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
it
would
meet
your
equal
protection
issue?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
for
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
at
issue
is
the
constitutionality
of
new
york
adoption
statute.
under
this
statute,
a
child
may
be
adopted
only
if
both
of
its
parents
consent
with
the
adoption.
an
exemption
is
made,
however,
with
respect
to
children
voluntarily
whereby
only
the
consent
of
the
mother
is
required
when
an
illegitimate
child
is
up
for
adoption.
regardless
of
the
circumstances,
is
that
the
father
has
no
comparable
rights
under
new
york
law.
thus,
a
categorical
distinction
is
made
in
this
respect
between
fathers
and
mothers
of
illegitimate
children.
the
parties
in
this
case,
the
appellant,
caban,
and
appellee,
mohammed,
are
the
parents
of
two
children
born
while
they
were
living
together
for
several
years.
over
those
years,
they
lived
together
as
a
family
and
appellant
contributed
to
the
support
of
the
children.
after
the
couple
separated,
the
children
continued
to
see
their
father
regularly
although
they
live
with
their
mother.
the
mother
married
another
man.
she
and
her
new
husband
then
sought
to
adopt
the
two
illegitimate
children.
the
natural
father's
objection
to
the
adoption
was
rejected
by
the
new
york
courts.
his
claim
that
the
statute
deprived
him
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
also
was
rejected.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
new
york
statute
is
in
invalid
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
at
this
with
respect
to
children
as
old
as
appellants
and
where
an
established
relationship
exists,
the
new
york
statute
bears
no
substantial
relation
to
any
important
state
interest.
accordingly
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
joined.
