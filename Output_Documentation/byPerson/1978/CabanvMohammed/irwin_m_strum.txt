mr.
irwin
m.
strum
your
honor,
i
am
not
going
to
discuss
the
facts.
that
is
correct.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
heard
the
attorneys
for
two
adversaries
talk
about
their
clients’
rights.
who
speaks
for
the
rights
of
the
two
children,
david
and
denise,
who
spoke
for
them
below?
well,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
surrogate
kings
county
was
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
determining
how
those
children
should
be
protected.
i
submit
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
new
york
gave
him
that
right
and
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
say
in
the
best
interests
of
these
children,
i
will
permit
this
adoption.
i
come
to
this
court
today
not
to
represent
any
litigant
and
not
to
argue
on
behalf
of
either
a
father
or
a
mother,
but
to
argue
on
behalf
of
these
children
and
their
rights.
and
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
permits
the
courts
to
say,
in
the
best
interests
of
these
children,
we
will
permit
an
adoption.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
believe
that
the
state
of
new
york
has
the
right
to
make
a
distinction
between
a
natural
mother
and
a
natural
father
where
a
child
is
born
out
of
wedlock.
this
court
has
time
and
again
approved
distinctions
between
natural
mothers
and
natural
fathers
in
a
situation
where
the
state
has
an
interest
to
protect
the
children.
i
don’t
think
the
difference,
as
provided
by
the
new
york
law,
is
very
severe,
because
the
ultimate
test
in
all
situations
is
the
best
interest
of
the
children.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
would
say
this
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no.
there
would
have
to
be
a
finding
of
unfitness.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
because
i
don’t
believe
the
father
stands
in
the
same
shoes
as
the
mother.
i
don’t
believe
he
is
a
member
of
a
protected
class.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
there
would
have
to
be
some
indication
or
proof.
i
don’t
know
if
it
would
have
to
reach
as
far
as
unfitness
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
would
say
so,
yes.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
wouldn’t
use
the
word
veto
but
either
parent,
under
certain
circumstances
and
under
certain
statutory
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
that’s
correct
your
honor,
and
i
concede
that,
but
i
don’t
think
that
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
what
was
that?
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
don’t
think
stanley
versus
illinois
has
any
relationship,
has
any
relationship
to
the
factual
situation
or
the
legal
situation
here.
here,
we’re
dealing
with
a
situation
where
we
have
a
competing
interest
between
a
mother
and
a
father.
now,
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
people
have
an
interest
in
the
child.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes
she
was,
the
mother
and
her
husband.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes,
which
would
be
the
normal
procedure
in
the
case
of
a
natural
mother,
and
i
think
the
court
has
a
right
to
say
that
in
order
to
benefit
the
child,
the
child,
we
will
allow
such
an
adoption.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
that’s
correct
your
honor.
in
quilloin
this
court
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
it
is
not
on
the
basis
of
sex;
it
is
on
the
basis
of
a
mother
or
a
father
and
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no
your
honor,
[laughter]
but
i
think
there
is
a
distinction,
and
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
it,
between
natural
mothers
and
natural
fathers
where
they
were
not
married,
and
i
think
that’s
the
important
factor
here.
i
don’t
think
that
this
man
has
any
paternal
rights
in
the
child.
i
think
the
child
is
somebody
who
has
to
be
protected
in
the
state
as
long
as
it’s
reasonable
in
doing
so
can
pass
a
law
which
permits
such
protection.
i
think
the
state
can
make
a
distinction
between
a
natural
father
and
a
natural
mother,
where
they
are
not
married
and
i
think
this
court
recognized
in
quilloin
that
a
father
of
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock
does
not
have
the
same
status
as
a
father
of
a
child
born
in
wedlock.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
no,
it
really
didn’t
leave
this
case
out.
it
may
not
have
dealt
specifically
with
this
case.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
well,
i
think
very
frankly
your
honor.
this
case
is
a
situation
where
you
have
a
mother
and
a
father
who
are
not
married.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
don’t
say,
i
don’t
say
that
their
rights
are
different,
i
say
to
you
the
test
will
ultimately
be
the
same,
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
yes,
there
is.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
the
difference
is
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
determined
that
a
natural
mother,
absent
special
circumstances,
bears
a
closer
relationship
with
her
child
by
the
very
fact
of
being
a
mother
than
a
father
does.
but
there
is
a
difference
between
a
mother
and
a
father,
vis-à-vis
the
relationship
of
the
child,
vis-à-vis
the
feelings
to
the
child,
vis-à-vis
living
together
and
after
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
think
that’s
the
experience
of
mankind.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
as
long
as
a
statute
bears
a
reasonable
relationship
and
the
object
of
the
legislation
is
to
protect
the
children,
and
i
don’t
think
that
the
father
is
in
a
protected
class,
i
don’t
think
it
is
for
this
court
to
say
that
the
legislation
is
improper.
i
think
the
legislature
of
a
state
has
a
right
to
set
up
these
standards,
make
these
requirements,
and
make
these
rules.
and
i
think
as
long
as
these
rules
and
regulations
and
statutes
bear
a
reasonable
relationship
to
everyday
life,
and
the
interest
of
the
child,
i
think
that
is
sufficient.
we
cannot
have
a
perfect
statute.
and
i
am
not
here
to
claim
that
our
statute
is
perfect,
but
as
long
as
the
test
is
the
best
interest
of
the
child,
i
think
that
is
all
that
is
required.
i
don’t
think,
as
i’ve
indicated
before
that
the
mere
accident
of
birth
that
a
man
is
a
father
of
a
child
gives
him
rights
to
control
the
destiny
of
that
child
where
the
best
interest
of
the
child
call
for
another
type
of
action,
and
i
don’t
feel
that
under
the
circumstances
that
this
statute
should
be
thrown
out
merely
because
the
man
comes
here
and
he
says,
well,
i
really
am
interested
in
this
kid.
i
think
there
was
a
full
hearing;
this
was
not
a
case
where
due
process
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
am
suggesting
that
the
surrogate
had
before
him
all
of
the
facts
concerning
the
relationship
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
am
not
suggesting
he
made
a
specific
finding
of
abandonment,
no.
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
or
unfitness.
i
am
suggesting
that
he
made
--
mr.
irwin
m.
strum
i
am
suggesting
that
there
must
be
facts
in
the
record
to
warrant
a
finding
as
to
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
and
all
of
those
facts
are
facts
which
he
had
before
him
including
the
relationship
of
this
father
to
the
child,
and
including
what
had
happened
between
the
father
and
the
child,
what
had
happened
between
the
father
and
the
mother.
all
of
this
was
before
the
court.
the
court
waived
these
facts
and
determined
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
