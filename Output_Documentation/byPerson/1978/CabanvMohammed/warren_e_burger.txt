e.

we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
caban
against
mohammed.
mr.
silk
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
raise
the
lectern
if
you’d
like,
the
lectern
itself.
the
handle
on
the
side
here
will
--
that’s
--
other
way,
bring
it
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
who
was
this
stepfather
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
of
some
significant,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
father,
the
adoptive
father,
had
succeeded
and
did
succeed
ultimately,
the
child
would
acquire
another
source
of
support,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
legally
enforceable
source
of
support.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
it
destroy
that
relationship?
the
court
may
place
the
custody
wherever
is
deemed
best
for
the
welfare
of
the
child
or
children,
may
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
they
do
have
the
power.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
foreclosed
if
the
child
is
adopted
by
the
new
husband?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
is
does
it
foreclose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
mean
the
court
doesn’t
have
the
power
to
permit
visitation
rights
for
the
natural
father?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
opinion
was
that
the
best
interests
of
the
child
called
for
there
being
with
the
mother
and
that
this
adoption
should
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
prevail
here,
how
will
these
rights
that
you’re
claiming
to
be
protective,
who
is
going
to
decide
how
often
he
can
see
the
child?
domestic
relations
i
suppose,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
asking
you
the
consequence
if
you
prevailed
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
either
one
of
them
can
control
the
custody
by
exercise
of
any
kind
of
a
veto.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
court
decides
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
judge
thinks
visitation
rights
are
good
for
the
child.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
schulslaper.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
you
are
telling
that
there
is
not
a
just
an
automatic
veto.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
won’t
help
you
very
much
counsel;
that
was
dissenting
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
you
better
stay
near
the
lectern,
so
that
we
can
all
hear.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
strum,
you
are
going
to
tell
us
about
the
law
of
this
case,
the
statutes
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
constitutional
aspect
of
a
statute
which
gives
a
different
right
to
the
natural
father
from
the
rights
given
to
the
natural
mother?
that’s
really
the
legal
question,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
stanley
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
caban
against
mohammed
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
