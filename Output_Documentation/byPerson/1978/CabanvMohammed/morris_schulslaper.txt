mr.
morris
schulslaper
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
mr.
caban
appeared
before
the
surrogate’s
court
of
kings
county
as
he
is
portrayed
today
and
the
advisory
position
compelled
by
section
111
of
the
domestic
relations
law
automatically,
because
the
first
principle
is
the
best
interest
of
the
child
neither
the
interest
of
the
father
putative
or
real,
or
the
interest
of
the
mother,
but
the
interest
of
the
child,
then
it
is
very
possible
that
the
surrogate
would
have
refused
to
allow
this
adoption.
if
he
were
able
to
establish
the
substantiality
that
he
projects
now
before
the
court,
that
could
have
happened.
if
he
were
able
to
establish
this
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
appellate
division
of
the
second
department,
there
is
little
question
in
my
mind
that
that
department
would
not
have
held
unanimously
against
mr.
caban,
but
under
the
authority
of
jerald
jj,
and
i
believe
the
citation
is
61
ad
2521,
it
could
have
reversed
the
surrogate;
it
could
have
denied
this
adoption,
not
because
the
interests
of
a
father
were
there
involved,
but
because
the
interests
of
the
child
were
there
involved.
and
because
in
jerald
on
an
advisory
position
they
found
that
the
father
was
involved,
a
fruitful
worker,
concerned,
he
traveled
from
california,
he
sent
cards,
he
sent
gifts,
that
the
adoptive
parent
was
not
quite
equal
to
low
circumstances.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
they
include
all
facets.
all
facets,
any
triable
issue,
any
factor
which
the
court
as
a
fact
can
find
would
be
injurious
to
the
child.
it’s
not
a
simple
statement
of
the
mother.
if
in
fact
--
mr.
morris
schulslaper
absolutely
not
your
honor.
the
instant
you
produce
the
standard.
the
best
interest
of
a
child
mr.
caban
had
the
right
and
he
was
granted
the
right
to
be
heard
fully.
mrs.
maria
mohammed
was
required
to
establish
that
that
adoption
was
in
the
best
interest
of
the
two
children,
but
as
he
is
portrayed
today,
he
was
not
portrayed
before
the
surrogate
of
kings
county
your
honor.
so,
mr.
caban
who
appears
today
--
mr.
morris
schulslaper
the
use
of
the
word
veto
troubles
me
your
honor.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
could
he
--
could
she
have
prevented
the
adoption?
the
answer
was
yes,
she
could
have
prevented
the
adoption
unless
the
facts
were
produced
to
persuade
the
court
that
she
was
totally,
her
presence,
her
custody
was
inimical
to
the
best
interest
of
the
child,
that
she
had
either
abandoned
him
or
for
whatever
reason
produced
before
the
court
on
evidence,
on
an
adversary
circumstance,
she
should
not
have
the
right
to
continue
custody
and
parenthood
of
that
child.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
exactly.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
exactly,
under
low
circumstances,
and
her
circumstance,
because
she
has
the
right
or
you
require
her
consent,
there
is
little
question
that
you
would
have
produce
strong
evidence,
and
there
was
a
little
question
that
under
least
circumstances,
the
state,
whether
it
was
a
state
of
georgia
under
quilloin
or
the
state
of
new
york
has
the
right
to
accept
what
mr.
justice
burger
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
stanley
versus
illinois.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
i
quite
understand
it
was
a
dissenting
opinion
your
honor,
but
i
point
out,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
that
this
was
not
an
adoption
proceeding.
this
was
not
a
circumstance
between
father
and
mother
whether
they
were
putative
or
real.
this
was
an
action
against
the
state
in
the
presence
of
a
living
viable
concerned
mother.
under
low
circumstance,
your
dissenting
opinion
holds
very,
very
strongly
in
favor
of
mrs.
mohammed.
the
fact
is
that
historically
we
have
accepted
that
the
mother
is
the
more
dependable
person
than
certainly
against
putative
father,
who
has
had
the
opportunity
and
certainly
in
this
case
has
had
the
opportunity
to
look
for
a
divorce,
to
sanctify
the
relationship
that
he
now
holds
so
dear
before
this
court.
the
same
man
who
found
it
most
convenient
on
the
facts
to
very
expeditiously
obtain
a
divorce
after
this
woman
was
married.
this
woman
did
no
more
and
that
relation
--
mr.
morris
schulslaper
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
that
is
correct
your
honor.
however,
while
i
don’t
want
to
go
into
the
facts,
i‘ve
exposed
them
on
in
my
brief.
certain
factors
have
come
up
in
the
appellant’s
reply
brief
and
certain
declarations
were
made
here,
and
i
believe
that
it’s
essential
for
this
court
consideration
to
point
out
several
factors.
he
claims
that
he
had
custody
of
these
two
children
for
two
months
before
the
adoption.
the
circumstances
of
his
so-called
custody
should
be
known
to
the
court.
i
am
aware
that
the
court
realizes
that
he
traveled
to
puerto
rico,
and
brought
the
children
back
under
the
guys
of
parenthood.
he
never
had
it.
the
closest
he
came
to
an
acknowledgement
of
parenthood
was
that
after
three
months
time
at
the
insistence
of
mrs.
mohammad,
he
allowed
his
name
or
he
allowed
the
board
of
health
to
record
him
as
the
father
on
the
birth
certificate.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
i
am
not;
i
am
trying
to
point
out
that
this
man’s
interest
was
not
of
the
great
depth
that
he
now
describes.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
yes,
reputative,
a
reputed
father.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
that
is
correct
your
honor,
as
i
understand
that
the
word
by
definition
is
reputed.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
this
court
has
so
held
them
quilloin
versus
walcott
that
the
father
had
less
veto
power
--
mr.
morris
schulslaper
that
this
--
that
georgia
had
the
power
to
give
less
veto
power,
to
use
that
word,
to
the
putative
father
leon
quilloin
than
what
it
was
required
to
give
to
a
father
who
had
been
once
married,
but
perhaps
divorced.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
that
would
be
quilloin
versus
walcott.
this
court
specifically
said,
“as
long
as
it
was
interested
to
the
child’s
best
interests,
then
it
had
the
right
to
give
less
veto
power
to
the
reputed
or
putative
father”,
the
unmarried
father
or
the
natural
father,
if
you
will.
the
state
of
new
york
has
that
same
right
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
the
problem
now
simply
is,
is
this
a
presumption.
the
fact
is
it
is
not
an
irrebuttable
presumption,
that
this
man,
caban,
had
the
right
to
walk
into
court
--
and
over
447
pages,
375
of
which
are
testimony.
he
had
the
right
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
the
statute
if
it
be
held,
if
it
be
so
held
as
a
presumption.
this
was
not
concluded
against
him.
he
was
simply
not
wiped
out
of
the
position;
he
had
the
right
to
be
heard,
and
as
new
york
state
applies
it,
where
the
right
was
substantiated,
where
his
position
was
substantiated
or
whether
--
forgive
me
--where
the
father
was
found
to
be
of
substantial
interest,
the
courts
did
not
allow
that
adoption
against
the
putative
father
to
go
forth.
the
state
has
that
right.
now
this
court
could
interfere
if
it
found
a
presumption
under
stanley.
it
cannot
interfere
on
the
basis
of
quilloin
unless
these
facts,
and
the
only
reason
i
can
think
of
the
case
being
before
this
court
is
the
challenge
to
the
circumstance
by
my
adversary
that
there
was
substance
to
his
relationship.
the
record
was
before
the
appellate
division
as
i
said,
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
very
same
justices
who
dissented
in
the
case
of
malpica-orsini
herein
known
as
orsini-blasi
joined
the
majority,
they
joined
--
mr.
morris
schulslaper
that
might
very
well
have
been
and
it
might
just
as
well
have
been
on
this
record,
your
honor.
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
that.
but
on
this
record,
there
was
no
substance
and
the
record
so
shows
it.
now
he
claims
that
he
purchased
the
house
and
that,
as
a
result
of
that
fighting
the
case
before
this
court
and
others,
he
has
been
rendered
--
he
has
impoverished
himself.
he
claims
that
he
was
a
married
man
at
the
time
that
he
made
application
for
adoption
and
reversed
from
the
putative
mother.
well,
it’s
important
that
this
court
know
the
facts.
he
took
the
children
back
to
the
city
of
new
york
by
chicanery,
using
his
own
parents
to
persuade
the
maternal
grandmother
who
had
lawful
custody
for
good
and
valuable
reason
to
bring
them
to
their
home.
his
visitation
rights
were
never
interfered
with,
nor
were
his
visitations
interfered
with
here.
when
he
called
--
when
he
had
notified
puerto
rico
that
he
was
going
to
go
down
there,
i
am
afraid
the
kids
were
made
available
to
him.
he
brought
these
children
back
from
puerto
rico
sometime
about
the
15th.
he
withheld
these
children
from
the
mother.
his
woman
--
his
wife
subsequently
his
wife
neena
actually
offered
to
assault
the
mother
of
these
children
when
she
attempted
to
take
the
children
or
even
talk
to
the
children.
it
was
not
until
the
25th
that
she
was
able,
she
found
the
children
on
the
24th.
on
the
25th
of
november
1975,
she
appeared
before
the
family
court.
there
she
was
given
a
date
by
the
family
court
until
the
18th
day
of
december.
on
the
17th
day
of
december,
she
gave
birth
to
a
child
by
her
now
husband.
the
first
time
she
was
able
to
regain
that
custody
was
on
the
15th
day
of
january.
mr.
caban
married
neena
on
the
16th
day
of
december
1975.
on
the
18th
he
was
scheduled
to
go
before
the
court
for
a
hearing.
the
premises
he
described
is
purchased
for
the
need
of
these
children,
he
contracted
for
on
the
29th
day
of
the
same
month
december.
subsequently,
one
year
after
this
case
was
decided
against
him
and
i
trust
that
the
court
has
the
entire
record
from
the
court
of
appeals,
he
made
application
before
that
court
to
be
allowed
to
proceed
as
a
poor
person.
he
claims
before
this
court
that
he
was
so
allowed
to
do.
he
was
not
under
the
order
of
the
court.
mr.
morris
schulslaper
your
honor,
thank
you
very
much.
under
the
circumstances
i
respectfully
rest
on
my
belief,
and
i
differ
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
for
the
balance
of
the
time.
thank
you.
