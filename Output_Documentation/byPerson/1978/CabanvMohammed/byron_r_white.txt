justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
in
divorce
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
where
new
york
leaves
divorce
parents,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
where
either
parent
can
veto
absent
some
finding
of
unfitness.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
divorced
parents,
as
long
as
they
haven’t
been
found
to
be
unfit,
each
of
them,
under
new
york
law,
can
prevent
the
adoption.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
applied
then
to
married
and
divorced.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
are
you
suggesting
that
the
state
can
have
a
law
that
said
that
the
child
could
be
removed
from
the
care
and
custody
of
both
parents
over
their
objection
as
long
as
the
state
concluded
that
it
was
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
without
some
finding
of
unfitness?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
why
--
how
--
why
doesn’t
there
have
to
be
some
finding
unfitness
for
the
father
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
he
was
a,
so
you
think
--
if
he
wanted
to
adopt,
if
the
father
wanted
--
the
unmarried
father
wanted
to
adopt
over
the
objection
of
the
mother,
the
state
could
not
permit
the
adoption
without
some
finding
of
unfitness
on
the
mother.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
the
same
thing,
and
i
take
that
the
law
is
where
the
parents
were
married
but
are
divorced.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
case
either
parent
has
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
either
parent
there
has
more
of
a
right
than
this
father
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
there
were
some
findings
made
that
he
had
abandoned
the
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
yeah,
but
are
you
suggesting
that
he
made
any
findings
about
unfitness.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
unfitness
or
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
there
should
be
--
must
be
facts
in
the
record
to
warrant
such
a
finding?
