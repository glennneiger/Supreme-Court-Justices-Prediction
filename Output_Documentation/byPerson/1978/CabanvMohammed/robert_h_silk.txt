mr.
robert
h.

thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
brings
to
this
court
for
review
a
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
by
dismissing
an
appeal
from
the
appellate
division
of
the
court,
from
an
order
of
the
surrogate's
court
in
new
york,
in
effect
affirmed
a
judgment
of
the
lower
court,
which
terminated
the
parentage
of
appellant
to
two
children
whom
he
had
sired,
whom
he
had
raised,
whom
he
had
cared
for,
whom
he
had
lived
with,
whom
he
had
supported
for
more
than
half
of
their
lives.
and
did
so
without
any
proof
of
unfitness,
did
so
without
any
particularized
findings
of
unfitness,
did
so
on
total
disregard
of
his
parental
rights
as
a
father,
and
effectively
broke
and
smashed
up
his
family
relationship
with
these
two
children
whom,
at
the
time
the
adoption
petitions
were
filed,
he
had
been
supporting,
he
had
been
caring
for,
he
had
bought
a
house
for,
they
had
lived
with
him,
and
whom
he
was
fighting
for
their
custody
in
another
court.
they
broke
up
the
relationships
of
this
man
with
his
children
without
any
finding
that
he
did
not
have
a
family
relationship
with
them
as
is
required
in
quilloin
against
walcott,
without
any
finding,
without
any
prove
at
all
that
he
was
a
bad
father.
they
broke
up
his
relationship
with
his
children
and,
in
effect,
replaced
him,
took
them
away
from
him
in
effect
and
replaced
him
with
a
stepfather
and
with
a
stranger
upon
this
sole
ground
that
he
was
of
the
male
sex
and
not
the
female
sex
and
that
being
of
the
male
sex
he
was
not
married
to
the
parent
of
the
female
sex.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
the
stepfather
was
the
husband
of
the
mother.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i
think
that
it
is
only
perhaps
of
some
significance
if
we
have
first
disposed
of
the
rights
and
interest
of
the
father
himself,
of
the
natural
father
who
had
been
raising
the
child.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i
would
have
to
agree
with
your
honor
that
that
is
what
would
have
happened.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
by
either
side.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
there
is
no
question
about
that
at
all.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
that
is
precisely,
that
is
precisely
what
my
argument
is.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i
do
not
see
how
the
father
could
take
the
child
away
from
the
mother
to
the
point
where
his
wife
would
become
the
adoptive
mother
of
the
child
and
the
original
mother
would
be
left
out
in
the
cold
and
i
make
no
claim
of
that
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well
the
child
would
have
had
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
no,
the
child
already
had
another
source
of
support
under
the
new
york
law,
because
under
new
york
law
a
stepfather
is
also
made
responsible
for
the
support
of
his
child
whether
or
not
that
child
is
adopted
by
the
stepfather.
but
what
the
adoption
would
do
and
did
do
was
to
terminate
the
obligation
of
appellant
to
support
his
child
and
appellant
did
have
an
obligation
to
support
his
child
prior
to
the
adoption,
even
though
the
child
was
born
out
of
wedlock.
so
what
the
adoption
did
was
to
replace
the
natural
father
with
the
stepfather,
to
no
advantage
of
the
child
except
to
destroy
the
child’s
relationship
to
his
natural
parent
--
to
their
natural
parent,
there
were
two
children.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
that
is
right,
but
this
was
not
a
custody
case.
a
custody
case
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
they
must,
they
must
place
the
child
in
terms
of
custody
with
whichever
parent
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
to
have
the
custody,
but
that
does
not
cause
the
termination
of
parental
rights.
the
child
still
sees
the
non-custodial
parent.
the
non-custodial
parent
still
retains
obligations
to
take
care
of
the
child.
the
non-custodial
parent
still
retains
the
opportunity
to
see
the
child,
and
the
child
knows
it
roots.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
the
adoption
has
a
different
effect
from
custody.
the
adoption
not
only
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes,
the
adoption
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
it
does
not.
the
adoption
completely
drops
a
blank
wall
between
natural
parent
and
child,
completely
totally
drops
a
blank
wall
and
the
only
way
that
the
child
can
ever
see
his
father
is
if
the
adoptive
parents
permit
the
child
to
do
so,
because
under
the
new
york
adoption
law,
the
child
has
now
a
new
set
of
parents
and
his
name
is
changed
--
their
names
are
placed
on
his
birth
certificate,
in
this
case
it
just
means
placing
the
name
of
the
mother
on
the
birth
certificate
--
of
the
adoptive
father
on
the
birth
certificate.
it
means
a
change
of
name,
it
means
the
change
of
identity,
it
means
a
total
change
for
the
child,
so
that
the
child’s
relationships
with
parental
people
are
destabilized,
and
instead
of
continuing
on
with
a
continuing
course
of
a
family
relationship,
which
the
child
had
had
with
its
natural
parent,
the
child
suddenly
finds
that
a
natural
parent
appears
to
the
child
to
have
rejected
the
child,
and
the
child
in
this
case
will
never
know
how
long
and
how
hard
his
father
has
fought
to
maintain
his
relationship
with
him.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes,
there
is
no
question
about
that
these
children
had
a
stable
relationship
with
their
father
and
i
would
think
probably
with
their
mother
before
the
adoption
proceedings
took
place.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i
don’t
quite
understand
your
honor’s
question.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes.
my
client
took
his
own
children
back
from
puerto
rico.
once
they
had
been
sent
by
the
appellees
and
where
they
had
remained
for
some
14
months
with
their
grandmother.
he
brought
them
back
to
new
york.
he
brought
them
into
his
home.
he
provided
them
with
a
home,
he
provided
them
with
support.
he
provided
them
with
a
family
and
he
took
care
of
them
and
wanted
to
continue
to
take
care
of
them
and
made
every
effort
to
do
so
until
he
was
compelled
by
a
temporary
interim
order
of
the
family
court,
which
was
made
only
prior
to
a
hearing
and
prior
to
a
determination
of
the
merits
to
turn
the
children
over
to
the
mother
on
a
temporary
basis,
but
reserve
the
rights
of
visitation
to
himself.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
actually
that
maybe
new
york’s
interest,
if
that
is
what
new
york
says
and
i
don’t
believe
that
it
is
quite
what
new
york
says.
new
york
says,
under
section
70
of
the
domestic
relations
law
that
there
shall
be
no
prima
facie
right
to
custody
of
a
child,
but
custody
shall
always
be
determined
in
the
best
interest
of
a
child.
but
again
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
is
not
a
custody
case.
this
is
a
termination
of
all
parental
rights.
this
is
breaking
up
of
a
family
case.
this
is
a
breaking
up
of
family
and
this
is
a
substitution
from
a
natural
father
--
for
a
natural
of
an
adoptive
father.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
not
the
family,
between
the
children
and
their
respective
parents
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
the
family
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
the
family
of
the
children
and
the
family
of
the
parents
and
while
the
parents
may
separate
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
that
is
the
situation
that
was
created
by
the
mother
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
no
it
wasn’t,
and
my
client
did
everything
he
could
to
make
it
a
normal
family
by
bringing
the
children
back
to
puerto
rico
and
when
the
children
came
back
to
puerto
rico,
the
matter
went
into
the
family
court
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
once
the
children
came
back
from
puerto
rico,
it
was
as
normal
as
families
of
divorced
families
by
the
millions
are
when
they
have
children.
it
was
a
family
in
which
the
child
custody
had
yet
legally
to
be
determined.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
maybe
it’s
more
normal
than
we
think
i
am
afraid,
because
i
agree
with
your
honor,
that
it
is
not
anything
that
is
to
be
looked
for,
but
there
are,
on
the
other
hand,
millions
of
divorced
families
in
this
country
and
they
have
managed
sometimes
through
the
aid
of
family
courts
to
work
out
custody
problem
and
visitation
problems
and
support
problems
so
that
the
children
are
not
shuttled
back
and
forth.
new
york
has
a
strong
policy
against
shuttling
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
your
honor
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
is
that
the
trial
judge
made
a
determination
and
he
made
a
determination
in
his
opinion
and
it
has
been
upheld
through
all
the
new
york
courts.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
that
was
part
of
it,
but
part
of
his
opinion
was
that
my
client
had
no
right
to
object
to
an
adoption
that,
that
was
not
a
legal
necessity,
and
the
prime
objective,
and
your
honor
is
quite
right
and
i
may
read
the
opinion
at
page
8,
the
appendix
28.
the
prime
objective
of
allowing
a
putative
father
to
be
heard
is
therefore
not
to
determine
the
degree
of
his
continued
interest
in
the
child,
but
rather
to
determine
the
best
interest
of
the
child,
that
is
what
the
trial
judge
said.
now
what
the
trial
judge
did
there
was
to
apply
the
wrong
legal
tests
because
in
a
situation
where
you
have
a
termination
of
parental
rights,
state
power
cannot
be
trusted
to
determine
that
the
best
interest
of
the
child
requires
the
replacement
of
his
natural
fit
father
with
a
stranger
and
the
breaking
up
of
the
child’s
natural
family
ties
with
his
natural
father
without
proof
of
unfitness.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
it
might
be
but
in
this
case
the
judge
was
saying
that
it
was
the
prime
objective
but
he
had
no
other
objective
whatsoever
to
show
and
he
did
say
that
a
putative
father’s
consent
to
such
an
adoption
is
not
a
legal
necessity,
at
page
27
of
the
appendix.
so
it
is
quite
clear
that
although
he
used
the
word
prime
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
and
that’s
what
under
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
he
certainly
was.
he
was
certainly
following
the
new
york
statue
and
that’s
why
this
case
is
coming
here
by
appeal,
and
not
by
certiorari,
because
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
a
putative
father
--
no
i
would
not
want
to
call
him
a
putative
father,
he
is
the
natural
father.
he
is
the
real
natural
father
of
this
child,
and
he
is
the
father
who
has
raised
and
supported
this
child
for
more
than
half
of
the
child’s
life
and
who
was
doing
so
at
the
time
the
adoption
petitions
were
filing,
and
he
was
fit
and
he
was
concerned,
i
would
say
he
did
have
a
right.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i
am
saying
all
natural
fathers
who
performed
as
did
my
client,
and
i
am
saying
that
all
natural
fathers
have
that
right
who
had
a
relationship
with
his
child.
now,
the
relationship
with
the
child
is
the
missing
factor
that
was
missing
in
quilloin
against
walcott.
in
that
case,
this
court
recently
considered
the
constitutionality
of
almost
an
identical
statute
from
the
state
of
georgia.
and
in
that
case
the
court
looked
very
carefully
at
the
relations
that
the
father
had
with
the
child
to
find
whether
the
father
had
a
protected
interest
with
the
child.
and
the
court
looking
at
these
relationships
found
that
they
were
skimpy
and
scanty
indeed
and
i
would
have
to
agree
that
quilloin
against
walcott
lays
down
the
law
and
that
is
that
a
father
who
has
only
sired
but
not
raised
the
child
and
has
played
no
role
in
raising
the
child,
he
has
not
a
constitutionally
protected
interest
under
stanley
against
illinois.
now,
stanley
against
illinois
referred
to
a
situation
in
which
stanley’s
family
was
being
dismembered,
if
the
illinois
law
were
applied.
in
which
stanley’s
children,
whom
he
had
sired
and
raised,
were
being
taken
away
from
him
if
the
illinois
law
applied
without
any
proof
of
his
unfitness.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
it
was
a
parental
termination
rights
case
and
in
terms
of
termination
of
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
the
mother
was
deceased.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
what
i
believe
–-
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
i
believe
that
it
was
a
little
more
than
that,
because
i
believe
that
the
child
was
being
treated
as
someone
who
could
be
placed,
taken
by
the
state
and,
made
award
of
the
state
of
illinois,
placed
for
adoption,
and
the
father’s
rights
were
in
effect
being
terminated
by
the
proceedings
that
was
taking
place.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well
it
was
–-
mr.
robert
h.
silk
no,
it
was
not
an
adoption
case.
but
it
was
a
termination
of
parental
rights
case.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes,
but
part
–-
well,
i
would
there
say
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
--
that
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
justifiably
maintained
that
a
father’s
relationship
with
his
children
is
any
less
valuable
and
important
than
a
mother’s
relationships
with
a
child.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes,
that
is
true.
but
the
net
effect
as
far
as
the
father
was
concerned
and
the
father’s
relationship
with
his
children
in
stanley
against
illinois
and
in
the
present
case
is
precisely
the
same.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes,
that
is
absolutely
correct
your
honor.
insofar
as
the
protectable
interest
of
the
father
is
concerned
in
his
child,
however,
the
effect
of
the
two
is
exactly
the
same,
because
in
both
stanley
against
illinois
and
in
this
case
at
stake
was
the
dismemberment
of
the
father’s
family.
at
stake
in
quilloin
against
walcott
the
father
did
not
have
a
family
with
the
children.
in
stanley
against
illinois,
the
father
had
a
good
family
with
the
children,
he
had
raised
them
and
supported
them,
and
he
had
lived
with
them
and
they
had
lived
with
him.
in
the
present
case
which
we
have
now
before
the
court,
we
have
precisely
the
same
situation.
in
quilloin
against
walcott,
we
did
not
have
that
situation.
in
quilloin
against
walcott
you
had
a
situation
in
which
the
father’s
relationship
with
the
child
was
wispy
at
best
and
in
which
the
child’s
relationship
with
the
proposed
adoptive
stepfather
was
a
thousand
times
stronger.
he
had
lived
in
the
same
home
with
the
adoptive
proposed
stepfather
--
i
mean
with
the
proposed
--
with
the
stepfather
who
was
the
proposed
adopting
father.
he
had
lived
in
the
same
home
for
seven
years.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
no.
the
statute
says
–-
mr.
robert
h.
silk
if
it
had
been
found
that
the
mother
had
abandoned
the
child,
then
the
mother
would
have
no
rights
under
the
new
york
statute.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
but
anything
less
than
abandonment,
any
skimpy
kind
of
a
relationship
which
might
in
new
york
not
constitute
abandonment,
the
skimpy
kind
of
relationship
that
mr.
quilloin
had
with
his
child,
if
the
mother
had
that
sort
of
relationship
with
the
child
in
new
york,
that
would
not
under
new
york
law
constitute
abandonment,
because
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i
see
the
relationship
in
this
case
to
be
the
protected
interest.
the
constitutionally
protected
interest
is
the
right
of
a
parent
to
raise,
to
rear,
to
have
the
company
and
companionship
of
his
child.
it
is
a
relationship
which
is
based
upon
the
history
and
upon
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
it
is
a
relationship
which
is
protected
for
the
mother
in
this
case
and
it
is
not
protected
for
the
father.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes,
insofar
as
custody
and
insofar
as
visitation
is
concerned,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
make
any
determination.
what
would
happen
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
the
consequences
if
we
prevail
here
would
be
that
the
matter
would
go
back
to
the
family
court
and
custody
would
be
determined,
and
visitation
would
be
determined,
and
support
would
be
determined
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
in
an
equity
and
fairness
to
all
parties.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
no,
it
would
not
necessarily
resolve
at
all.
if
the
family
court
took
the
case
over,
the
family
court
would
have
full
power
after
a
hearing
and
after
a
trial
to
turn
over
custody
to
the
mother
with
rights
of
visitation
to
the
father.
it
would
have
power
to
turn
over
rights
of
custody
to
the
father
with
rights
of
visitation
to
the
mother.
it
would
have
a
right
to
mold
whatever
remedy
that
it
feels
proper
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes,
it
would
be
exactly
like
divorce
cases.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well
it
would
prevent
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
it
would
prevent
the
adoption
unless
the
parents
agree
that
the
children
should
be
adopted.
there
is
no
reason
why
they
both
can
not
adopt.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
an
adoption
which
would
cause
the
replacement
of
a
parent
who
is
fit
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
a
parent
might
consent
to
it
and
the
other
parent
might
consent
to
the
adoption
by
the
other
one,
in
other
words
there
maybe
a
reason
where
they
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
that’s
exactly
where
new
york
leaves
divorce
parents.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
either
parent
--
if
the
parents
are
divorced,
the
situation
would
be
the
same
as
it
would
be
here
if
i
should
prevail
in
this
case,
yes.
that
is
if
divorce
parents
treated
their
children
as
my
client
treated
his
children
and
then
they
could
not
be
replaced
by
adoption.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
oh
yes
without
any
question
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
no,
if
there
is
a
dispute
over
custody
that
will
be
what
court
decides
will
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child’s
right.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
with
visitation
rights,
but
parental
rights
preserved.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
visitation
rights
are
almost
invariably
granted
to
one
extent
or
to
another
extent
in
new
york
depending
upon
the
facts.
sometimes
restricted
visitation
is
allowed,
but
always
some
visitation
is
allowed
under
the
worst
of
circumstances,
so
that
the
children
will
continue
to
know
their
roots
and
will
continue
to
have
a
relationship
with
their
natural
parent,
and
natural
parent
will
continue
to
feel
that
that
parent
has
an
offspring
and
a
child
that
that
parent
would
be
able
to
come
and
see
and
to
protect
and
to
support
and
to
care
for
as
best
that
parent
could.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
a
line
drawn
on
the
basis
of
sex.
this
line
is
drawn
on
the
basis
of
sex
to
the
point
where
it
serves
absolutely
no
purpose.
it
treats
a
mother’s
relationship
with
her
child
in
a
constitutionally
protected
sense.
the
mother
after
all
was
unmarried
in
this
case
to
the
father
as
much
as
the
father
was
unmarried
to
the
mother,
the
mother
entered
this
relationship
fully
aware
that
the
father
had
a
prior
un-dissolved
relationship
which
prevented
marriage
and
yet
she
was
willing
to
do
it,
and
she
took
the
father’s
name
and
she
bore
two
children
for
the
father,
and
the
father
and
she
together
lived
in
a
common
home
and
brought
these
children
up.
and
under
new
york
law,
this
has
given
the
mother
a
protected
relationship
with
the
children,
and
it
has
given
the
father
absolutely
no
protection
whatsoever.
in
stanley
against
illinois,
and
in
all
of
the
cases
which
stanley
against
illinois
has
cited,
both
parents
have
very
important
protected
interest
in
maintaining
their
relationships
with
their
children
and
it
is
cardinal
with
this
court
and
it
is
cardinal
with
us
as
stated
against
prince
against
massachusetts
that
the
custody
care
and
nurture
of
the
child
reside
first
in
the
parents
whose
primary
function
and
freedom
include
preparation
for
obligations
the
state
can
neither
supply
nor
hinder,
and
it
is
in
recognition
of
this
that
these
decisions
have
respected
the
private
realm
family
of
life
which
the
state
cannot
enter.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
but
again
we
are
not
dealing
with
custody,
we
are
dealing
with
termination
and
rupture
of
parental
rights,
and
it
isn't
the
mother
against
the
father,
it’s
a
stranger
against
the
father
because
the
mother
is
not
replacing
the
father
as
a
father,
it
is
the
stranger
who
is
taking
the
father’s
place.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
in
quilloin
against
walcott,
we
had
very
similar
situation.
in
that,
the
mother
was
married
to
the
proposed
adoptive
father
and
the
natural
father
was
trying
to
prevent
the
adoption.
this
court
had
that
issue
before
at
that
time
except
that
it
had
in
a
different
factual
context.
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
marshall
for
this
unanimous
court,
the
opinion
specifically
limited
itself
to
the
situation
before
the
court
and
the
opinion
in
quilloin
did
not
say
that
because
it
happen
to
be
the
mother
and
her
husband
who
are
trying
to
adopt,
it
said
because
the
natural
father
did
not
have
a
relationship
to
his
child
which
was
constitutionally
protected
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
i
would
say
that
the
natural
father,
if
he
had
played
a
role
even
as
brief
as
it
possibly
could
have
been,
a
parental
role,
a
parental
relationship
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
and
he
was
barely
able
although
he
tried
to
establish
some
sort
of
connection
with
the
child
and
shows
some
concern.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
yes,
i
would
say
that
he
did,
because
he
had
an
interest
in
that
child
which
was
as
young
and
new
as
the
child
was
itself
and
he
couldn’t
possibly
have
established
a
stronger
relationship
than
he
did
and
he
tried
and
if
he
made
the
effort,
then
i
think
that
the
child
was
lucky
to
have
a
concerned
father
who
wanted
to
look
after
this
child’s
interest,
and
if
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
my
answer
is
yes,
again
depending
on
the
facts
of
that
particular
relationship.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
it
would
not
be
meet
my
due
process
issue.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
well,
if
they’re
equal,
at
least
they
would
be
equal
but
it
would
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
silk
they
would
have
to
apply
to
both,
i
understood
the
question
to
apply
to
all
parents.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
that’s
the
way
i
understood
it.
it
would
meet
the
equal
protection
argument,
but
it
would
not
meet
the
due
process
argument,
and
the
due
process
argument
is
a
very
important
argument
because
it
is
our
contention
that
state
power
does
not
exist
to
break
into
the
private
relationships
of
families
and
of
parents
and
children
and
just
tear
them
apart
because
somebody
happens
to
think
it’s
in
the
best
interest
to
replace
perfectly
fit
and
caring
father
with
somebody
else,
and
the
state
doesn’t
have
a
right
to
go
into
this
area.
this
is
a
sacred
area.
mr.
robert
h.
silk
if
the
state
in
this
particular
case
has
entered
it,
of
course,
through
its
courts
and
through
its
laws.
and
although
the
parties
have
individually
invoked
the
assistance
of
the
state
and
the
appellant
is
now
invoking
the
assistance
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
we
are
still
facing
state
action
and
it
is
state
action
that
is
broken
these
children,
taken
these
children
from
their
parents.
from
one
of
their
parents
who
has
loved
them
and
i
say
that
a
law
which
provides
for
a
sex
discrimination
of
this
type
in
this
case
is
obsolete.
that
it
bares
no
relationship
to
a
substantive
purpose
which
a
state
has
any
right
to
defend,
which
has
any
right
to
promote.
it
is
not
in
the
interest
of
the
state
to
promote
the
adoption
of
children
by
their
mothers
and
not
by
their
fathers.
thank
you
your
honor
my
time
has
expired.
