mr.
silk
this
is
a
strange
family.
when
a
husband
and
wife
live
in
separate
residences
in
new
york
and
the
children
are
living
in
puerto
rico,
that
is
not
a
normal
family.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that’s
not
a
normal
family.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
still
wasn’t
a
normal
family.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then
maybe
i
object
here
saying
that
a
divorced
family
is
a
normal
family.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
we
all
know
that;
why
not
get
to
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn’t
understand
the
question
would
be
the
--
the
state
went
in,
and
i
understood
that
my
brother
powell’s
question
was
the
two
parties
together
go
into
the
state
and
ask
for
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
important
are
these
facts
to
this
statute
which
we
are
talking
about?
isn’t
it
true
that
if
this
man,
this
very
petitioner
in
this
case
apparently
was
the
highest
pillar
in
his
church,
and
who
loved
--
the
only
thing
he
loved
more
than
children
were
his
own
children,
and
he
spent
94
and
99
percent
of
the
money
on
his
children.
he
is
still
--
the
statute
would
apply
to
him
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what’s
the
difference
in
this
case?
we
are
talking
about
this
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
which
opinion
it
was
announced?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
gives
the
wife
the
veto
but
--
and
denied
to
the
father.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
going
to
get
the
stanley
before
you
quit,
aren’t
you?
let
me
know
when
you
get
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
against
illinois.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
understood
that
the
mother
wasn’t
adopting
this
child.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mother
and
the
husband.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
talking
about
a
statute
that
applies
to
any
situation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
along
with
the
statute
that
says
that
strictly
on
sex
and
nothing
else,
you
say
there’s
nothing
wrong
with
that
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
any
mothers
that
are
fathers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
familiar
with
that
case,
as
i
understand,
it
left
this
case
completely
out,
didn’t
it,
didn’t
it?

marshall
