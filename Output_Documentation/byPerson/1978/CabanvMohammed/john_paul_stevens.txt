justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel
before
you
go
into
the
fact,
let
me
just
question
one
statement
you
made.
supposing
he
had
tried
to
adopt
with
his
new
wife
and
the
court
had
been
persuaded
that
it
would
have
been
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
to
allow
that
adoption,
just
assume
that,
even
though
i
know
this
case
in
your
view
is
different.
it
would
nevertheless
be
true,
would
it
not
that
the
wife
had
an
absolute
veto
over
such
an
adoption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
an
unqualified
right
to
prevent
the
adoption
for
taking
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
was
--
that
would
be
only
under
the
statute
if
one
of
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
understand
counsel;
we
are
you
now
denying
paternity
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
a
little
while
ago
you
used
the
word
putative
father.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
putative.
justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel
if
we
could
get
away
from
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
for
a
moment,
what
do
you
say
as
to
what
is
the
justification
for
a
rule
that
treats
the
mother’s
power
and
the
attempt
by
the
father,
the
natural
father
to
adopt
differently
from
the
father’s
right,
to
object
to
the
mother’s
attempt
to
adopt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
strum,
assume
a
case
in
which
say
a
child
is
six
years
old,
spent
three
years
with
the
father,
three
years
with
the
mother,
no
marriage.
what
is
the
justification
for
giving
them
different
rights
when
they
get
into
a
battle
with
this
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
thought
everyone
had
agreed
that
even
if
the
best
interest
of
child
might
lie
with
the
father,
the
mother
could
still,
assumedly
she
had
abandoned
all
the
rest
of
it,
she
could
still
object.
isn't
there
a
difference
under
new
york
statute
in
the
position
of
the
mother
and
the
position
of
the
father?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
assuming
that
equal
time
with
the
child
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
six
year
old
child,
what's
the
justification
for
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you’re
saying
legislatures
determine
that
but
what's
the
basis
for
that
determination?
how
do
you
support
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
