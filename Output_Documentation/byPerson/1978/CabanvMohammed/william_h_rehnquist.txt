justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
counsel
that
these
children
had
a
very
stable
relationship
before
the
adoption
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
call
it
--
would
you
think
it
was
something
that
new
york
was
constitutionally
required
to
say
met
the
minimum
standards
for
raising
of
children?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
shifting
back
and
forth
and
the
tensions
that
obviously
existed,
didn’t
your
client
take
the
children
back
at
one
time
and
didn’t
your
opponent’s
client
take
the
children
at
one
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
sounds
to
me
like
your
argument
is
kind
of
like
a
joint
tenancy
one,
that
on
divorce
the
husband
gets
a
half
right
on
the
children
and
the
wife
gets
a
half
right
on
the
children.
i
think
new
york’s
approach
is
that
neither
parent
necessarily
has
any
compelling
interest
in
the
child,
that
it’s
the
children’s
welfare.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
family
broke
up
when
the
natural
mother
and
the
natural
father
separated
didn’t
it
for
all
practical
purposes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that’s
two
different
families.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren’t
you
reading
the
word
prime
as
if
it
were
only
in
that
sense?
prime
simply
means
the
foremost.
it
does
not
mean
the
only,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
contend
that
the
putative
father
constitutionally
has
an
absolute
right
to
veto
an
adoption
like
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
you
saying
that
all
natural
fathers
have
that
right
or
just
your
client
under
these
particular
circumstances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
the
maternal
grandparents.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
provided
custody
would
necessarily
resolve
under
your
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
prince
was
a
case
where
the
mother
and
father
were
both
united
against
the
state.
here
you’ve
got
a
mother
and
father
one
of
whom
the
state
supports
and
other
of
whom
it
doesn’t
support.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
i
am
saying
is
that
your
quote
from
prince
is
in
a
context
where
the
mother
and
father
were
not
separated,
they
were
united
in
opposing
an
intrusion
of
the
state.
that
isn't
the
case
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
telling
us
that
the
new
york
definition
of
the
best
interest
of
the
child
may
include
the
concern
of
the
natural
father.
