justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
know
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
haven't
reached
and
dealt
with
title
vii?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
that
if
that
--
you
would
suggest
that
if
there
were
title
vii
--
if
there
are
some
claims
on
the
other
side
about
title
vii,
the
court
of
appeals
should
first
address
title
vii?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
rested
its
final
holding
on
1981
you
just
said,
as
the
way
--
as
you
read
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
while
you
are
interrupted,
perhaps
you
could
explain
to
me
if
you
can,
what
the
basis
was
for
the
court
of
appeals'
statement
in
its
footnote
6,
right
after
it
had
held
that
the
1969
test
was
irrelevant
in
this
case
because
the
applicant
list
had
been
exhausted
before
any
of
these
present
plaintiffs
or
applicants.
they
had
not
been
affected
by
the
1969
test,
but
that
second
paragraph
on
footnote
6;
“it
is
equally
clear
that
defendant's
decision
to
employ
the
1972
written
test
as
the
selection
device
was
an
unlawful
employment
practice,
which
had
adverse
impact
on
the
racial
class
of
plaintiffs.”
now,
your
insistence
is
that
although
the
1972
test
was
given,
the
only
time
that
any
time
after
that
when
you
hired
people,
you
claim
it's
conceded
that
there
was
nondiscriminatory
hiring.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
claim
is
that
the
1972
test
has
not
had
an
adverse
effect
on
any
of
these
plaintiffs?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
is
the
basis
for
this
second
paragraph
of
this
footnote
6?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
some
finding
one
way
or
another
with
respect
to
the
1972
test
in
the
district
court's
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
it,
just
looking
at
it
as
a
test,
but
did
it
find
that
these
particular
plaintiffs
had
been
adversely
affected
by
the
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
they
find
it
that
they
had
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
again
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong,
what
they
say
in
the
second
paragraph,
is
not
the
case
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
have
already
said
that
the
1969
test
did
not
involve
any
illegality
because
it
hasn't
affected
anybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
mean
the
quote
hiring
order.
what
i
mean
is
that
shouldn't
you
win
if
they
are
wrong
in
that
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
19
--
or
title
vii
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
suggestion
is
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
district
court's
findings
for
that
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
they
did
not
find
that
these
plaintiffs
have
been
affected
by
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
see
that
the
court
of
appeals
not
only
said
the
1972
test
was
an
unlawful
employment
practice,
but
it
said
it
had
an
adverse
impact
on
these
plaintiffs.
justice
byron
r.
white
appendix
83.
it
said
it
was
an
unlawful
employment.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
you
do
not
know
of
anything
in
the
district
court's
findings
which
supported
that
part
of
this
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
get
to
the
relief
yet,
do
not
get
to
the
relief,
what
about
standing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
case
when
it
was
--
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
twice
on
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
are
suggesting
they
misunderstood
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
they
were
right
though,
let
us
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
they
were
absolutely
correct
in
everything
they
said
in
the
text
where
you
read,
what
about
the
case
then?
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
go
on
one
part,
now
what
about
the
–
let
us
assume
they
are
right
that
the
1969
test
is
not
implicated
here
because
these
people
just
were
not
affected
by
the
1969
tests?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
class,
now
how
about
the
1972
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
were
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
they
were
not
--
but
i
take
it
you
do
not
claim
that
this
class,
that
any
of
them
were
ever
rejected
on
the
basis
of
this
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
what
is
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals'
statement
in
the
footnote
that
this
1972
test
had
an
adverse
impact
on
the
racial
class
of
plaintiffs?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
is
enough
to
get
some
relief
if
you
concede
that
none
of
your
class
members
was
ever
rejected
because
of
his
performance
on
this
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
true
that
none
of
them
was
ever
rejected
based
on
his
performance
on
this
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you
drafted
and
submitted
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
and
it
says
all
present
and
future
applicants.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
did
not
you
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
that
for
you
and
it
refused
apparently?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
did
remand
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
remand
it
because
it
disagreed
with
the
district
court
on
the
height
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
your
position.
it
does
not
seem
to
me
if
you
read
it
and
yet
they
have
refused
to
correct
your
oversight?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
not
the
court
ask
you
to
submit
a
judgment
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
winners
usually
start
off
with
it,
do
not
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
drafted
it,
who
submitted
the
initial
draft?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
if
they
are
beyond
the
statute
limitation
for
monetary
relief,
what
possible
advantage
can
there
be
to
sending
it
back
and
asking
that
the
judgment
be
equitably
for
the
benefit
of
past
applicants?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
complaint
is
the
case
filed?
this
one
or
the
original
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
say
nothing
at
the
court
of
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
said,
you
reserved
your
position
with
respect
at
that
time,
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
did
not
manipulate
the
rules
in
waiting
till
a
judgment
to
certify
a
class
either,
did
they?
