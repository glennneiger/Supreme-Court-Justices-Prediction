justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask,
what
do
you
understand
the
1981
violation
to
have
been
and
when
it
occurred
and
who
were
effected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
with
respect
to
the
1969
test,
it's
correct,
is
it
not
that
there
are
no
plaintiffs
who
were
affected
by
that
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
that
be
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
can
we
have
a
1981
issue
arising
out
of
the
1969
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
argue
that
the
order
should
be
set
aside
because
there
is
no
plaintiff
entitled
to
that
relief
before
the
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
we
do
not
have
to
reach
this
1981
issue,
do
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
which
you
write
a
law
review
article
about
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
named
plaintiffs
who
took
the
1969
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
who
can
represent
the
class
of
those
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
hunt,
before
you
get
to
the
evidence,
what
does
the
order
certifying
the
class
provide,
there
was
such
an
order
i
take
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
comply
with
the
federal
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
us
take
first
of
all
with
the
litigant
side
before
we
talk
about
the
merits.
i
just
read
pages
4
of
your
complaint,
there
is
nothing
in
there
by
anyway
taking
the
1969
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
i
do
not
want
to
get
to
the
law.
i
want
to
get
what
in
the
record
shows
that
the
69
test
was
ever
put
in
the
issue
on
behalf
of
someone
who
took
the
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
[voice
overlap]
define
back
to
1868
or
when
is
the
date
on
which
application
became
significant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
past
applicants,
but
how
do
i
know
that
includes
1969
applicants
and
people
took
the
test
in
1969,
what
in
the
record
shows
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
it,
where
does
the
record
show
that
anybody
thought
they
were
litigating
on
behalf
of
someone
who
took
the
test
in
1969,
certainly
you
are
complaint
does
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
is
the
class
certification
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hunt,
did
you
ask
for
monitory
relief
on
behalf
of
the
past
applicants?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
the
judgment
says
word
for
word
exactly
as
it
is,
it
does
not
make
a
bit
of
difference
whether
a
past
applicant
is
part
of
the
case
or
not,
they
are
just
all
apply
in
the
certain
same
way,
do
not
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
also
true
that
in
paragraph
10
on
page
31,
the
defendants
reserved
their
position
that
evidence
of
discrimination
before
the
effective
date
of
title
vii
was
inadmissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
were
apparently
not
agreeing
that
past
discrimination
was
relevant
or
even
past
applicants?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
notice
also
that
we
have
talked
about
monetary
relief
earlier,
there
was
an
agreement
that
the
monetary
claims,
the
claim
of
back
pay,
would
not
be
tried
and
that
would
not
prejudice
the
right
of
those,
any
of
those
who
had
back
pay
claim
to
assert
it
elsewhere?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
sounds
like
the
back
pay
claims
were
being
included
in
the
claim
--
in
the
class?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
careful
of
preserve
the
rights
of
past
applicants
who
might
has
such
claims
to
litigate
the
statute
limitation
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
because
apparently
none
of
the
named
plaintiffs
were
in
that
position
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
adequately
demonstrates
how
there
can
be
a
conflict
of
interest
between
a
named
plaintiff
who
is
a
current
applicant
and
a
member
of
class
who
is
the
past
applicant
who
might
have
a
damage
point?
