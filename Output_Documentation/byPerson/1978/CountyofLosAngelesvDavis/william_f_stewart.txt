mr.
william
f.
stewart
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
employment
discrimination
case
in
which
the
fire
department
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
was
found
liable
in
order
to
make
future
hires
in
accordance
with
a
quota
for
blacks
and
mexican
americans
until
the
fire
department
received
--
achieved
racial
parity
with
the
surrounding
county
population.
the
case
raises
the
issue
of
whether
42
u.s.c.,
section
1981
embodies
constitutional
equal
protection
standards
and
requires
a
showing
of
discriminatory
intent
to
establish
a
violation
of
that
statute
or
whether
title
vii
standards
in
which
intent
is
irrelevant
or
applicable.
since
the
discriminatory
hiring
took
place
prior
to
the
march
1972,
effective
date
of
title
vii
as
to
public
agencies,
the
case
raises
the
issue
of
whether
through
1981
title
vii
standards
could
be
applied
retroactively
as
to
public
agencies.
the
other
fundamental
issue
is
whether
the
quota
hiring
order
mandating
40%
minority
hires
until
racial
parity
is
achieved,
so
within
the
remedial
authority
of
the
trial
court
under
the
facts
and
the
findings
of
the
case.
this
employment
case
is
different
from
others
of
recent
vinigen
(ph)
that
comes
before
the
court
with
an
express
finding
by
the
trial
judge
that
the
county
of
los
angeles
had
not
engaged
in
any
intentional
discrimination.
the
county
had
long
administered
a
traditional
civil
service
aptitude
tests
for
fire
fighters
as
well
as
other
applicants
for
county
jobs
similar
to
those
utilized
by
the
district
of
columbia
in
washington
v.
davis.
other
testing
criteria
for
this
particular
job
were
great
at
oral
interview,
a
5'7”
minimum
height
standard
and
physical
and
mental
tests
--
medical
tests.
this
action
was
brought
in
january
of
1973
by
plaintiffs,
none
of
whom
were
prior
unsuccessful
applicants
for
the
position.
and
they
challenged
only
two
exam
criteria,
two
written
exams,
one
given
in
1969
and
one
given
in
1972
and
the
height
standard,
as
these
were
the
only
exam
criteria
shown
to
have
a
disproportionate
impact
on
minorities.
now
the
administration
of
the
1972
case
was
somewhat
unique
because
after
the
1969
exam,
the
county
of
los
angeles
in
an
attempt
to
increase
minority
representation
in
the
fire
department
and
to
reduce
any
disparate
impact
of
their
tests,
decided
to
go
to
a
random
selection
method.
in
that
regard,
they
administered
the
written
tests
in
january
of
72,
graded
it,
97%
of
the
applicants
passed.
the
county's
intention
then
was
to
draw
by
random
selection
applicants
from
those
that
passed,
the
97%
that
passed
and
then
proceed
with
them
through
the
regular
process,
the
oral
interviews
and
other
portions
of
exam
which
had
not
shown
to
have
any
adverse
impact.
unfortunately,
the
random
selection
method
was
enjoined
by
another
lawsuit
on
the
basis
that
it
violated
the
civil
service
provisions.
consequently,
there
was
no
hiring
by
the
county
for
two
years
during
the
pendency
of
this
litigation.
finally
in
desperate
straits
because
of
the
shortfall
in
fire
fighter
personnel,
the
county
proposed
to
interview
the
top
540
applicants
on
the
written
exam
for
the
purpose
of
filling
the
immediate
requirements
of
the
fire
department.
there
was
no
hiring
however
for
approximately
two
years
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
title
vii
as
to
public
agencies
until
after
the
judgment
in
this
case.
the
law
–
the
threat
of
the
lawsuit
intervened
and
there
was
--
and
consequently
the
county
never
did
effectuate
the
intent
to
interview
the
top
544
applicants,
but
proceed
with
them
all
through
the
remaining
stages
of
the
examination
process
and
no
adverse
impact
nor
was
there
any
discrimination
in
the
compiling
of
the
subsequent
eligibility
list.
during
the
trial,
the
court
found
no
intentional
discrimination
on
behalf
of
the
county,
but
in
reliance
on
title
vii
standards,
held
the
county
liable
because
their
written
exams
in
1969
and
1972
had
a
disproportionate
impact
on
minorities
and
had
not
had
been
validated.
the
court
upheld
the
height
standard.
the
court
went
on
to
impose
a
remedy
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
or
remitting
alleged
past
discrimination,
a
remedy
of
20%
blacks
and
20%
mexican
americans
hired
until
complete
racial
parity
was
achieved
between
the
county
fire
department
and
the
community,
the
county
of
los
angeles.
the
ninth
circuit
on
re-hearing
raised
--
on
re-hearing
after
the
county
raised
the
intent
issue
in
the
wake
of
this
court's
decision
in
washington
v.
davis,
reversed
the
trial
court’s
height
finding,
upheld
the
court
order
and
appalled
the
finding
of
discrimination
in
the
use
of
the
tests
on
title
vii
grounds,
notwithstanding
the
lack
of
discriminatory
intent
and
expressing
the
holding
that
intent
was
irrelevant
under
section
1981
as
it
is
under
title
vii
and
that
there
was
no
operation
of
the
distinction
between
title
vii
liability
and
liability
based
on
section
1981.
we
believe
that
the
circuit
court
seriously
erred
in
holding
that
title
vii
liability
principles
applied
to
section
1981
and
that
no
intent
to
discriminate
need
be
established.
this
court
in
griggs
versus
duke
power
articulated
judicially
the
disproportionate
impact
standards
based
upon
this
court's
interpretation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
issue
in
this
case
then
really
revolves
around
the
intent
of
the
39th
congress
and
the
original
enactment
of
the
statute
we
now
know
as
section
1981,
and
the
effect
of
any
of
congress's
enactment
of
title
vii
in
1964.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes
i
will,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
did
also
discuss
it
in
my
reply
brief.
well,
perhaps
i
could
address
it
now.
i
just
simply
to
state
that
i
think
the
government's
position
was
wrong
on
that
point.
the
quota
hiring
order
in
this
case
designed
to
--
was
clearly
designed
to
remedy
past
discrimination
and
was
clearly
predicated
upon
a
finding
of
violation
of
section
1981.
that
clearly
raises
the
issue
of
the
standard
of
liability
under
section
1981.
we
feel
it
has
to
be
resolved.
if
this
--
if
the
court
determines
that
constitution
equal
protection
standards
apply
to
section
1981,
then
under
the
trials
court's
finding
in
this
case
that
there
has
been
no
deliberate
indiscrimination
then
we
believe
that
the
quota
hiring
order
must
fall
in
its
entirety.
the
quota
hiring
order
is
still
in
effect.
the
county
has
been
obeying
that
quota
of
hiring
order
since
judgment
was
entered
in
this
case.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
disapprove
the
quota
hiring
order.
it
expressly
approved
of
the
quota
hiring
order,
stating,
we
do
not
necessarily
believe
that
the
1:1:3
hiring
ratio
is
incorrect.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
we
do.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
the
test
was
given
in
january
1972.
it
(inaudible)
while
they
attempted
to
resolve
the
question
of
the
random
selection
method.
the
test
was
never
implemented
in
a
disproportionate
manner
in
that
there
were
hires
made
based
on
rankings
on
the
test.
the
county
never
did
go
ahead
and
interview
any
of
the
top
544
applicants
on
the
test.
they
went
and
interviewed
the
entire
97%
that
passed.
they
interviewed
them
in
january
and
february
of
1973
and
then
compiled
an
eligibility
list
at
time,
an
eligibility
list
which
was
conceded
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
not
to
have
been
done
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
well,
there
is
still
the
question
of
the
appropriateness
of
remedy
under
any
presumed
title
vii
violation
that
may
have
occurred.
the
plaintiffs
have
claimed
that
their
un-effectuated
intent
to
interview
the
top
540
rose
to
the
level
of
the
title
vii
violation.
i
do
not
believe
however
they
content
that,
that
justifies
or
forms
a
predicate
for
a
quota.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
well,
the
court
of
appeals
quite
frankly
mr.
justice
white
is
quite
confusing.
they
have
intermixed
the
standing
questions
with
1981
and
title
vii
and
so
forth.
i
read
that
case
is
holding
as
to
have
violated
section
1981
notwithstanding
the
lack
of
intent
and
that
--
and
uphold
the
quota
hiring
order
for
the
purposes
of
remedying
past
discrimination
which
could
only
have
occurred
under
section
1981.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
addressed
that
subject.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
as
i
read
it
but
the
title
vii
question
was
also
before
them
and
i
imply
that
they
found
no
title
vii
violation.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
understood
from
the
reading
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeal's
decision
that
the
1981
violation
consisted
of
the
utilization
of
the
1969
written
exam
and
presumably
the
height
standard
that
had
an
adverse
or
disproportionate
effect
on
minorities
without
showing
that
it
was
validated.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
pardon
sir.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
we
have
the
1981
issue
because
the
quota
order,
which
the
court
approved,
it's
predicated
on
the
1981
violation
since
the
--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
think
the
quota
hiring
order
could
be
vacated
on
the
basis
that
it
was
excessive
in
that
it
seeks
to
remedy
discrimination
for
which
plaintiffs
have
no
standing
to
represent
the
parties.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
well,
i
think
it
is
a
significant
perhaps
on
a
technical
basis.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
it
is
a
[laughter]
–
there
have
many
written
about
it
sir,
but
i
think
it
is
a
critical
issue
that
is
really
before
the
court
because
the
quota
hiring
order
is
predicated
upon
the
finding
of
a
1981
violation.
and
as
i
will
note
in
the
moment,
i
think
there
is
significant
problems
with
finding
no
intent
standard
under
section
1981.
the
adverse
consequences
on
the
enforcement
procedures
of
title
i
and
title
vii
for
one,
the
effect
on
cases
that
are
currently
pending
with
other
governmental
agencies,
they
have
been
sued
around
1971
and
1972
under,
before
title
vii
become
effective
as
to
their
discriminatory
acts
in
which
the
court
said
that
intent
was
not
required
and
it
applies,
the
question
of
the
applicability
retroactively
of
title
vii
to
public
agencies
who
do
not
become
subject
to
title
vii
until
1972.
but
we
believe
that
congress
in
19
--
39th
congress
when
they
enacted
section
1981
could
not
have
had
the
title
vii
adverse
impact
validation
standards
that
arose
through
the
court's
griggs
decision
in
mind.
the
purpose
of
section
1981
was
to
remove
the
legal
disabilities
of
blacks
and
to
provide
them
with
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
certainly
many
civil
service
tests
have
administered
by
the
federal
government
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
section
1981
that
probably
had
the
desperate
impact
on
minorities
and
the
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
outlaw
those
tests
simply
by
showing
that
they
had
a
disparate
impact.
the
impact
of
the
enactment
of
title
vii
in
1964
on
1981,
i
submit
was
very
little
if
any.
congress
considered
1981
to
be
a
separate
and
independent
statute.
there
appears
to
be
no
indication
that
they
intended
to
change
that
statute
or
to
remove
that
remedy.
this
court
in
johnson
v.
railway
express,
held
that
the
statutes
certainly
were
overlapping
and
related,
but
not
necessarily
that
they
employed
the
same
standards
of
liability,
certainly
they
are
related
to
the
same
end
of
eliminating
discrimination,
they
apply
to
racial
discrimination.
they
both
apply
to
employment
discrimination
and
they
both
apply
to
intentional
discrimination,
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
they
both
apply
to
title
vii
standards
of
liability
predicated
upon
showing
of
disparate
impact.
the
constitution
itself
overlaps
to
those
answers
well
that
this
court
held
in
washington
versus
davis
that
the
constitutional
standards
for
discrimination
were
not
the
same
as
those
for
title
vii.
the
argument
is
raised
that
they
should
construe
title
vii
in
pari
materia
with
the
civil
rights
act;
those
civil
rights
act
now
in
section
1981.
but
this
strikes
a
rather
discordant
note
because
the
1964
civil
rights
act
expressly
excluded
public
agencies
such
as
the
county
of
los
angeles
for
its
coverage.
so
you
cannot
engraft
into
section
1981
title
vii
standards
by
leaning
on
the
rather
weak
stem
of
the
court
--
of
the
congress's
enactment
of
title
vii
in
1964
because
they
obviously
intended
not
to
extend
that
coverage
to
public
agencies
until
1972.
to
hold
that
the
intent
is
irrelevant
under
section
1981,
i
think
would
have
adverse
consequences.
it
would
permit
circumvention
of
title
vii
procedures
that
were
laboriously
debated
in
congress.
it
would
extend
title
vii
liability
standards
to
employers
that
congress
intended
to
exclude.
cases
have
come
up
recently
in
the
lower
courts,
johnson
versus
alexander
where
the
government
argued
that
the
army
was
not
subject
to
title
vii,
but
if
a
suit
could
be
brought
under
1981
and
apply
title
vii
standards
that
way
then
the
distinction
or
the
exclusion
of
the
military
from
the
coverage
of
section
--
of
title
vii
in
1964
is
relatively
meaningless.
similarly
in
johnson
versus
ryder
(ph),
the
claim
was
made
that
a
bona
fide
seniority
system
was
illegal,
by
attempting
to
apply
title
vii
standards
through
section
1981
despite
this
court's
ruling
in
the
teamsters
case.
the
recognizing
an
instant
–
an
intent
standard
for
section
1981
will
not
adversely
impact
upon
the
enforcement
of
equal
employment
opportunities
because
title
vii
is
now
applicable
to
public
and
private
agencies.
the
plaintiff
still
has
the
benefit
of
section
1981
in
private
and
public
cases
where
you
can
show
we
believe
deliberate
discriminatory
intent
does
not
mean
that
statistics
are
not
prohibitive
in
section
1981
actions.
this
court
indicated
in
arlington
heights,
they
can
be
prohibitive
for
proving
the
question
of
intent,
but
that
is
a
far
cry
from
saying
that
the
title
vii
standards
of
--
having
to
show
job
relating
to
supply.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
the
quota
issue.
as
i
stated
in
response
to
an
earlier
question,
the
quota
was
predicated
upon
a
violation
of
section
1981.
it
would
have
followed
that
if
there
has
been
no
violation
of
section
1981
because
there
has
been
no
showing
of
intent,
the
quota
would
fall.
now,
we
are
mindful
of
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts,
including
the
observation
of
this
court
in
bakke
that
a
quota
hiring
order
may
be
appropriate
as
a
remedy
in
cases
of
proven
discrimination.
the
issue
at
bar
however
in
regards
to
the
quota
is
not
the
appropriate,
that
is
quotas
in
general,
but
whether
the
one
entered
in
this
case
was
over
broad,
not
properly
tailored
to
the
extent
of
the
proven
wrong,
and
was
in
excess
of
the
court's
remedial
jurisdiction.
there
is
clear
distinction
that
has
to
be
made
between
liability
and
remedy.
the
quota
is
a
remedy
and
it's
not
a
device
to
achieve
racial
parity,
but
it
must
be
related
to
the
proven
wrong.
the
proven
wrong
in
this
particular
case
was
the
1969
test,
which
had
a
disparate
impact
on
mexican
americans
in
the
high
standard.
the
quota
remedy
should
be
applied
with
caution
because
it
impacts
on
innocent
third-parties.
it
is
not
like
applying
remedy
of
back
pay
where
it
is
a
question
between
the
employer
and
the
employee,
but
the
quota
remedy
obviously
adversely
impacts
on
innocent
third-parties
who
have
been
denied
a
job
if
they
were
not
a
member
of
the
or
beneficiaries
of
the
quota
themselves.
so
we
must
balance
the
rights
of
the
victims
as
against
the
rights
of
the
innocent
third-parties.
judging
the
quota
order
in
this
case,
we
feel
that
it's
clearly
excessive.
it
was
imposed
to
remedy
past
discrimination
and
not
to
assist
the
plaintiffs,
none
of
whom
had
been
prior
applicants.
it
was
not
limited
to
the
actual
ascertainable
victims
of
any
discriminatory
practices.
it
was
designed
to
cure
presumed
discrimination
no
matter
how
remote
and
time
it
may
have
occurred.
the
county
fire
department
was
composed
of
individuals
who
have
been
hired
over
25-30
year
period.
it
is
one
of
those
positions
like
of
law
enforcement
where
there
is
a
concern
for
long-term
retirement
and
so
forth,
and
so
there
is
little
turn
over
in
that
department.
and
so
the
quota
order
in
this
case
presumes
a
pattern
of
discrimination
extending
far
back
beyond
the
1969
test,
even
beyond
title
vii's
enactment
in
1964,
discrimination
that
was
totally
unproven.
and
the
anomaly
of
the
case
is
that
individuals
who
may
have
been
victimized
by
any
discrimination
would
have
their
claims
time
barred
as
they
are
not
filed
in
time,
but
minorities
who
have
not
actually
suffered
discrimination
would
get
a
preference
under
this
quota
at
the
expense
of
whites
and
other
minorities,
not
black
and
mexican
americans,
would
have
the
beneficiaries
of
the
order.
thus
we
feel
that
the
quota
in
this
particular
case
is
now
achieved
the
character
of
a
device
to
achieve
racial
balance
and
not
a
remedy
for
proven
discrimination.
in
fact,
the
finding
say
that
it
is
designed
to
cure
past
discrimination
as
indicated
by
the
racial
imbalance
of
the
department.
and
of
course
as
has
been
mentioned
by
questions
from
your
honors,
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
have
no
standing
to
represent
past
applicants,
indicates
that
the
quota
order
was
not
designed
to
remedy
any
discrimination
as
far
as
they
were
concerned,
but
was
designed
to
remedy
presumed
past
discrimination,
discrimination
that
apparently
the
court
felt
would
have
resulted
in
the
county
department
being
at
racial
parity.
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
what
the
racial
composition
of
the
county
fire
department
would
have
been,
even
it
had
no
discriminatory
practices
if
any
had
been
utilized
in
past
years,
no
consideration
of
the
racial
characteristics
and
demography
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
whether
there
has
been
an
increase
or
decrease
in
blacks
or
mexican
americans
over
the
years.
the
quota
order
is
simply
--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
it
was
the
same
type
of
exam.
there
had
been
some
changes
over
the
years.
there
was
no
evidence
we
could
ascertain
as
to
the
effects
of
the
1968
exam
which
is
one
immediately
preceding
the
1969
exam,
or
no
records
as
to
previous
exams.
the
only
evidence
in
the
trial
was
as
to
the
exam
content
itself,
i
think
it
was
the
1972
exam
and
statistics
relating
to
the
impact
of
the
1969
exam.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
that
is
correct.
there
was
a
slight
bit
of
evidence
as
far
as
1968
was
concerned.
the
percentage
of
minority
applicants
for
the
1968
exam
was
extremely
low.
i
would
say,
it
is
in
the
pretrial
order
and
it
is
in
the
appendix,
but
i
would
say,
it
was
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
about
3%
or
4%
minority
applicants
for
the
1968
exam.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
is
contrasted
with
the
25%
minorities
that
took
the
1972
exam
was
as
a
result
of
an
active
recruiting
effort
the
county
had
entered
into
in
the
intervening
years.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
that
was
one
of
the
allegations,
but
it
was
unproven
and
there
was
--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
that
is
correct
and
there
was
no
finding
that
they
had
engaged
in
discrimination.
and
to
the
extent
that
there
was
any
intent
involved,
i
think
that
was
dissolved
by
the
court's
express
finding
that
the
county
had
not
discriminate
--
they
had
not
engaged
in
deliberate
discrimination
and
to
the
contrary,
the
court's
finding
was
the
county
had
made
the
efforts
to
recruit
more
minorities
to
the
fire
department.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
oh!
yes.
it
is
conceded
there
has
been
no
discriminatory
hiring,
so
before
the
effective
date
of
[cross
talk]
mr.
william
f.
stewart
that
is
correct
and
i
think
they
concede
that
in
their
answer.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
i
believe
that
it
is
an
implication
that
the
court
felt
–
that
the
ninth
circuit
felt
that
the
mere
threat
to
utilize
the
test
by
interviewing
the
top
544,
goes
to
the
level
of
the
title
vii
violation.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes,
the
district
court
found
that
the
1972
test
violated
1981
and
title
vii.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
no,
it
did
not
find
that
they
had
been
adversely
affected
by
the
test.
in
fact,
the
plaintiffs
--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
well,
i
think
that
it
was
unnecessary
for
the
court
to
do
that
because
the
plaintiffs
themselves
in
their
second
amended
complaint
alleged
that
we
had
stopped
using
discriminatory
hiring
practices.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
and
conceded
that
they
were
not
adversely
affected.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
well
–
mr.
william
f.
stewart
the
case,
the
ninth
circuit
decision
mr.
justice
white
is
to
my
view
inexplicable
but
the
case
is
not
over
because
the
county
approved
the
quota
hiring
order.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes
i
think
we
should
win
sir
and
that
is
exactly
my
position.[laughter]
mr.
william
f.
stewart
pardon?
mr.
william
f.
stewart
just
standing
alone
i
think
could
win
the
case
forth.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
the
district
court
did
find
that
the
county
had
violated
sections
1981
and
title
vii
now.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
no,
they
did
not,
but
there
is
no
question
that
these
plaintiffs
had
not
been
affected
you
know
by
the
1972
exam.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
the
footnote
6.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
well,
the
court
must
have
been
implying
that
the
threat
to
utilize
the
1972
test
in
a
method
that
would
have
had
an
adverse
impact
if
implemented,
adversely
affected
them
and
gave
them
standing
to
challenge
the
1972
test.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
not
at
the
moment
sir.
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
thank
you.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes
your
honor.
the
plaintiffs
have
suggested
that
we
are
jointly
responsible
for
the
oversight,
to
that
i
would
like
to
plead
not
guilty
before
the
united
states
supreme
court.
actually,
counsel
prepared
it
and
i
approved,
but
the
point
is
and
they
are
not
attempting
to
mislead
the
counsel
any
time
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
but
i
raised
the
standing
issue
in
my
answer,
which
is
in
the
appendix,
i
raised
the
standing
issue
in
a
motion,
in
opposition
to
certification
of
the
class,
i
raised
the
standing
issue
and
preserved
it
in
the
joint
pretrial
statement
of
page
a-19.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes,
on
the
pretrial
order
on
page
19,
i
stated
defendants
are
in
no
way
prejudiced
as
to
their
assertion,
but
this
action
may
not
be
maintained
as
the
class
action.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
paragraph
one
was
merely
a
statement
as
to
what
they
have
represented.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes,
i
agree
to
everything
that
is
in
the
pretrial
order.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
reserving
my
objection
that
they
had
no
standing
to
represent
those
past
applicants
and
--
mr.
william
f.
stewart
yes,
i
did
agree
to
that.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
but
i
have
continued
throughout
this
trail
including
briefs
filed
with
the
ninth
circuit
both
times,
objecting
to
the
standing
of
the
plaintiffs
to
represent
the
class
and
it
is
not
merely
a
question
of
pleading,
because
there
is
no
past
applicants
that
are
named
defendants
in
the
case.
mr.
william
f.
stewart
well
that
is
right
sure
sir.
but
we
have
raised
these
points
continuously
and
we
have
continuously
lost
on
all
of
these
points,
the
1981
issue,
the
application
of
title
vii,
the
standing
issue
and
everything
through
with
the
ninth
circuit.
we
hope
that
we
will
not
lose
the
case
before
this
court.
well,
i
think
the
issues
on
section
1981
and
the
intent
are
important.
the
counsel
indicates
he
would
like
to
matter
remanded
and
that
will
bring
of
course
the
1981
intent
issues
to
the
fore
again.
thank
you.
