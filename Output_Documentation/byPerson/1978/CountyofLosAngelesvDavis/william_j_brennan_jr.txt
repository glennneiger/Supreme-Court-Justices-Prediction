black
and
mexican

justice

this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
determined
in
1973
that
certain
hiring
practices
in
the
county
of
los
angeles
respecting
the
county
fire
department
violated
42
united
states
code
section
1981.
the
district
court
in
an
unreported
opinion
and
order
permanently
enjoined
all
future
discrimination
and
entered
a
remedial
hiring
order.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
in
part,
reversed
in
part
and
remanded
the
clause
for
further
consideration.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
questions
presented
as
to
whether
the
use
of
arbitrary
employment
criteria
racially
exclusionary
in
operation,
but
not
purposefully
discriminatory,
violates
42
u.s.c.
1981,
and
if
so,
whether
the
imposition
of
minimum
hiring
quotas
for
fully
qualified
minority
applicants
is
an
appropriate
remedy
in
this
employment
discrimination
case.
unfortunately,
we
can't
reach
those
questions.
we
now
find
that
the
controversy
has
become
moot
during
the
pendency
of
this
litigation.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
direct
that
court
to
modify
its
remand
as
to
direct
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
action.
mr.
justice
stewart
dissents
and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joins.
mr.
justice
powell
also
dissents
and
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
joins.
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
