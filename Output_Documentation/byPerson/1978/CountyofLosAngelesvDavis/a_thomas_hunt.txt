mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
standing
point,
it
is
important
we
believe
to
note
that
the
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
these
plaintiffs
did
not
have
standing
is
based
entirely
upon
the
fact
that
the
scope
of
the
class
was
defined
as
present
and
future
applicants.
the
court
of
appeals
at
page
13-34
specifically
stated
in
light
of
the
fact
that
plaintiffs
class
did
not
include
any
prior
unsuccessful
applicants,
it
follows
that
plaintiffs
neither
suffered
nor
were
threatened
with
any
injury
in
fact
from
the
use
of
the
1969
examination.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
i
was
reading
from
the
fed
second
cite
your
honor.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
no,
that
is
the
second
opinion.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
the
second
opinion
begins
on
page
79
and
it
is
at
the
second
sentence
on
page
83
your
honor.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
that
is
what
i
was
looking
at
originally.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
alright
your
honor,
i
meant
to
say
13-37,
yeah.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
13-37
in
the
lower
right
hand
corner.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
and
on
page
83
of
the
appendix.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yeah,
the
next
sentence
after
that
sentence.
in
light
of
the
fact
that
plaintiffs'
class
did
not
include
any
prior
unsuccessful
applicants,
it
follows
that
plaintiffs
neither
suffered
nor
were
threatened
with
any
injuring
in
fact
from
the
use
of
the
1969
examination.
now,
we
must
concede
that
the
scope
of
the
class
in
this
case
did
not
include
past
applicants,
the
record
is
perfectly
clear.
and
logically,
we
must
concede
that
it
does
follow
that
past
discrimination
cannot
be
attacked
and
logically
from
that
i
am
afraid
we
must
concede
that
the
kind
of
relief
that
was
obtained
in
this
case
is
hard
to
justify.
the
truth
of
the
fact
is
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
that
is
what
i
am
discussing.
i
believe
the
--
our
position
is
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
the
case
was
litigated
as
if
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
had
represented
past
applicants.
the
original
complaint
was
played
on
behalf
of
past
applicants.
the
law
is
clear,
they
could
have
represented
past
applicants.
the
case
as
mr.
justice
white
are
cited
on
pages
43
and
44
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor
in
the
original
brief
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
in
order
to
correct
the
oversight
of
the
fact
that
the
scope
of
the
class
did
not
include
past
applicants.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
or
the
class.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
they
were
your
honor.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
the
defendant
was
about
to
take
an
all
white
class,
excluding
the
plaintiffs
and
the
present
class.
we
brought
the
lawsuit
in
the
defendants
status.
so
they
were
threatened
with
discrimination.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
my
interpretation
is
the
same
as
my
opponents
that
the
defendants
were
about
to
discriminate
and
rebut
the
lawsuit
and
that
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
we
do
not
think
that
your
honor
and
that
is
why
we
think
that
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
correct
the
oversight.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
we
have
decided
not
to
cross
petition
because
record
is
clear
to
us
that
it
was
a
mere
oversight
by
the
district
court
that
past
applicants
were
not
included.
the
case
was
tried
as
if
past
applicants
have
been
represented.
the
evidence,
all
went
into
trial
as
to
past
applicants.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
they
turned
that
around
your
honor
and
it
was
our
intention
to
correct
it
on
the
remand
and
we
are
suggesting
that
this
curt
should,
as
the
government
does,
should
vacate
the
granting
of
certiorari
and
correct
this
mere
oversight.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes
we
did.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes
we
did
your
honor.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
no,
there
are
not
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
the
case
as
cited
in
our
brief
of
pages
43
and
44,
establish
that
plaintiffs
can
represent
present
applicants,
for
example,
can
represent
past
applicants
and
vice
versa.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
that
is
why
we
believe
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
a
correction
of
the
oversight?
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
beyond
question
that
it
was
a
mere
oversight
and
the
oversight
should
be
corrected
and
i
would
like
to
reiterate
the
reasons
the
record
is
clear.
first
of
all,
the
original
complaint
was
plead
on
behalf
of
past
applicants.
page
4
of
the
record
shows
that.
secondly,
at
the
trial,
evidence
came
in
as
to
past
the
applicants
and
i
would
like
to
emphasis
to
the
court
that
it
was
not
just
limited
to
the
1969
test,
we
put
on
a
great
deal
of
evidence
as
to
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
the
order
certifying
the
class
provides
--
excuse
me,
there
was
no
formal
order,
the
order
was
included
in
the
judgment.
this
case
went
to
trial
very
quickly.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
whether
that
is
the
case.
this
case
went
to
trial
almost
immediately
after
the
granting
of
the
motion
for
class
certification
and
we
included
the
order
in
the
judgment.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
i
think
that
is
their
basic
ground
and
we
agree
with
them.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
we
do
not
know
what
is
going
to
happen.
our
opinion
is
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
mere
oversight
occurred
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
i
feel
very
strongly
that
it
is
important
to
realize
that
this
case
was
tried
on
behalf
of
past
applicants.
our
basic
case
was
not
as
is
suggested
by
either
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
or
my
opponent
that
it
was
just
written
test
but
our
basic
case
was
a
prima
facie
case
based
on
work
force
statistics.
this
employer
had
one
half
of
1%
black
in
a
very
large
black
general
population
area
and
that
was
our
basic
case.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
i
would
refer
you
to
the
cases
cited
on
pages
43
and
44
of
our
brief
that
is
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
it
was
put
in
issue
on
behalf
of
the
class
of
past
applicants.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
the
class
--
we
believe
we
were
litigating
the
case,
the
court
believed
we
were
litigating
the
case,
it
is
my
impression,
everybody
believed
we
are
litigating
the
case
on
behalf
of
past
applicants.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
none
of
the
named
plaintiffs,
we
do
not
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
alright,
your
honor
the
stipulations
in
the
pretrial
order
have
great
detail
as
to
the
1969
test
and
the
findings
of
the
court
included
the
1969
test.
i
would
point
out
that
my
opponent
stated
that
the
district
court
did
not
make
findings
as
to
the
69
test.
the
findings
are
that
the
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
it
is
in
the
judgment.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
the
judgment
was
jointly
drafted
by
both
counsels
your
honor.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes
your
honor
and
that
was
an
oversight.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
on
remand,
we
would
want
to
show
to
the
district
court
that
this
case
that
there
was
a
mere
oversight
and
that
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
past,
present,
and
future
applicants.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
it
was
oversight
in
our
opinion
on
all
counsel
and
the
court.
the
evidence
came
in
this
case
as
to
past
applicants
without
objection.
the
fact
that
it
is
so
clearly
an
oversight
your
honor,
i
think
is
exemplified
by
the
fact
that
in
the
very
first
sentence
of
the
court
of
appeals'
original
decision,
they
have
mistakenly
stated
that
the
class
included
past
applicants.
everyone
just
assumed
the
past
applicants
were
represented
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
it
followed
the
oversight
and
that
is
why
we
believe
it
should
be
remanded
to
correct
the
oversight.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
can
only
say
that
this
judgment
includes
the
order
of
class
certification,
the
issue
was
not
tried,
the
issue
was
not
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
fastened
on
it
on
its
own
motion.
the
first
time
that
i
realized
the
past
applicants
were
not
represented
your
honor
was
when
i
read
the
second
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
there
were
not
12
lawyers
in
this
case
for
the
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
that
includes
our
counsel
besides
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys.
those
are
all
of
the
attorneys.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
the
two
lawyers
tried
this
case
for
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
i
could
not
agree
more
with
that.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
i
think
the
district
court
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
correct
the
oversight.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
i
asked
the
court
of
appeals
to
instruct
the
--
on
a
petition
for
rehearing,
when
this
oversight
first
came
to
my
intention,
i
asked
the
court
of
appeals
to
instruct
the
district
court
to
investigate
whether
it
was
an
oversight.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
that
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
that
it
is
an
oversight
past,
present,
future
applicant,
the
case
was
fully
tried.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
i
think
the
district
court
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
correct
the
oversight
and
that
is
why
it
should
be
remanded.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
i
have
no
explanation
for
that.
they
denied
my
petition
for
rehearing
without
explanation.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
they
remanded
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
and
because
of
their
finding
on
[voice
overlap]
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
i
really
do
not
consider
it
to
be
my
mistake.
this
order
was
jointly
prepared
by
all
parties
and
by
the
court
and
we
all
are
guilty
of
the
oversight.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes,
the
court
asked
both
parties.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
in
this
case
your
honor,
the
court
asked
both
parties
to
prepare
the
judgment.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
we
drafted
it
together
your
honor.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
we
did
not
your
honor
because
in
this
case,
they
were
beyond
of
the
statute
of
limitations
period.
as
far
as
monetary
relief
under
section
1981,
they
were
not
beyond
the
statute
of
limitation's
period
for
equitable
relief
because
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
so
that
those
past
applicants
will
have
the
opportunity
to
be
hired
prospectively
in
order
to
give
them
the
best
--
relief
we
can
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes
your
honor,
the
difference
it
makes
is
that
in
that
case,
the
hiring
order,
the
40%
hiring
order
based
on
past
discrimination
is
appropriate.
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
marshall's
point
that
he
has
made
at
least
twice
here
in
his
questions
to
me
that
this
is
a
very
confused
situation
and
i
have
attempted
as
best
i
can
to
get
the
matter
back
to
the
district
court
in
order
to
correct
the
oversight,
in
order
to
determine
what
the
hiring
order
actually
is
going
to
be
and
i
suggest
that,
that
is
what
should
be
done.
the
point
i
must
reiterate
is
that
it
is
not
true
that
the
liability
in
this
case
was
only
based
on
two
tests.
the
liability
on
this
case
basically
was
an
un-rebutted
prima
facie
case,
which
this
court
in
the
teamsters
case
recognized
as
being
an
appropriate
way
to
establish
liability
in
cases
such
as
this
one.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes
and
this
case
was
a
class
action,
which
we
all
believe
was
brought
on
behalf
of
the
past,
present,
and
future
applicants
and
we
were
attempting
to
establish
the
prima
facie
case
by
the
same
way
as
the
government
did
in
that
case
and
our
statistics
did
show,
the
district
court
specifically
recognized
those
statistics.
the
problem
that
we
face
here
is
not
only
this
confusion
on
every
one's
part
as
to
whether
past,
present,
and
future
or
just
present
and
future
applicants
where
represented,
but
in
addition,
we
have
the
problem
that
there
has
been
a
remand
on,
assuming
there
is
to
be
a
hiring
order,
how
much
the
hiring
order
should
be.
and
again,
it
is
difficult
to
deal
with
a
case
where
we
do
not
have
a
concrete
situation
before.
and
for
that
second
reason,
we
agree
with
the
government
as
we
did
in
the
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
the
remand
should
be
carried
out
--
this
court
and
the
parties
before
it
should
have
a
concrete
situation
before
it.
perhaps
the
most
important
point
on
this
standing
is
and
i
would
reiterate
coming
back
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
stevens
that
these
plaintiffs
did
have
standing
to
represent
past
applicants.
we
have
cited
a
long
line
of
cases
at
pages
43
and
44
of
our
brief,
your
honor,
which
show
that
past,
present
applicants
can
represent
past
applicants
and
vice
versa,
employees
can
represent
applicants
and
vice
versa.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
those
cases
are
all
employing
--
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
there
are
all
cases
following
courts,
this
court's
decision
in
other
areas
of
the
law.
this
court
has
never
ruled
on
the
specific
issue
in
the
employment
discrimination
area.
it
has
ruled
on
it
in
other
areas
such
as
shareholders,
derivative
suits
and
other
types
of
classed
actions
that
you
do
not
need
a
plaintiff
for
each
and
every
minor
part
of
the
class.
for
example,
it
is
important
to
note
in
this
case
that
the
test
used
by
the
county
that
was
in
the
process
of
being
applied
to
the
current
applicants,
were
also
used
in
earlier
years.
my
opponent
indicated
the
modifications
were
very
minor,
those
tests
are
in
it,
we
are
putting
evidence
as
plaintiffs'
exhibits
three
and
four;
the
past
test
as
well
as
the
present
test.
and
under
those
circumstances,
it
is
clear
to
us
that
these
plaintiffs
did
have
standing
to
challenge
and
bring
a
lawsuit
on
behalf
of
past
applicants
as
well
as
present
and
future
applicants.
the
1981
issue
comes
before
this
court
assuming
that
past
applicants
can
be
and
were
represented
the
--
it
was
interesting
to
me
to
read
the
argument
made
by
the
county
in
their
reply
briefs,
which
was
just
filed
last
week
and
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
argument
made
by
my
opposing
counsel
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
affirm
a
hiring
order
and
almost
an
assumption
that
the
oversight
will
be
corrected
on
the
remand
and
it
is
at
that
point
that
we
get
to
the
1981
issue.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
in
the
original
which
is
not
part
of
the
appendix,
at
page
4
of
the
record,
pass
the
case
is
put
on
behalf
of
past
applicants.
that
is
not
part
of
the
appendix
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
no
your
honor,
the
complaint
was
tried
on
the
basis
of
the
pretrial
order,
which
is
part
of
the
appendix.
and
if
you
take
even
a
cursory
look
at
the
appendix,
it
shows
a
great
deal
of
evidence
stipulated
to
in
the
pretrial
order
as
to
past
discrimination.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
there
are
great
many
other
things
such
as
that
the
past
evidence
was
admitted
without
objection
as
to
the
past
discriminates,
it
was
stipulated
to
in
the
pretrial
order.
my
recollection
is
that
the
pretrial
order
specifically
provides
that
it
is
to
govern
the
proceedings
in
the
case.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
that
except
that
it
was
brought
to
no
one's
intention
until
the
second
opinion
of
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
i
agree
your
honor.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor
i
agree
that
this
court.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
the
pretrial
order
provides
that
it
is
to
govern
the
future
proceedings
in
the
case
your
honor.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
the
answer
to
your
question
your
honor
is
yes.
the
pretrial
order
is
to
govern
the
proceedings.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
now,
your
honor
i
am
not
asking
this
court
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
i
agree
that
this
case
--
that
this
court
should
not
correct
the
oversight.
i
agree
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
the
pretrial
order
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
the
pretrial
order
specifically
--
my
recollection
is
the
pretrial
order
specifically
states
that
it
is
to
set
the
meats
and
bounds
and
the
pretrial
order
includes
all
the
stipulations
as
to
past
discrimination
and
the
case
was
tried.
the
district
court
specifically
based
its
findings
on
past
discrimination.
of
course,
if
past
applicants
were
not
included
in
the
represented
class,
the
district
court
would
not
have
based
its
decision
on
past
discrimination.
perhaps,
the
most
important
thing
that
i
should
say
to
this
court
on
the
point
is
that
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor
on
page
18,
there
is
a
statement
of
the
issues
to
be
tried.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
as
far
as
i
can
say
right
now
your
honor,
no
except
that
i
would
interpret
the
joint
statement
of
the
issues
to
be
tried
to
supersede
the
pleadings.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
and
i
would
not
the
very
first
sentence
is
whether
or
not
as
a
question
of
fact
and
my
defendants
have
engaged
to
that
past
tense.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
merely
that
the
word
past
was
left
out
of
the
definition
of
the
scope
of
the
class.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
in
the
clause
certification
order
that
is
found
in
the
judgment.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
i
think
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
determine
that.
did
mr.
justice
white
have
a
question?
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
i
think
your
honor
that
the
question
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
it
was
an
oversight
and
to
straighten
out
this
difficult
situation.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes,
they
were
arguing
the
1981
point.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
they
were
arguing
the
1981
point
at
that
point
and
that
is
what
we
have
all
conceive
to
be
the
substantive
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
yes,
we
were
afraid
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
alright
your
honor,
we
had
determined
as
best
we
could
that
there
were
statute
of
limitations
problems,
not
with
the
equitable
relief,
but
with
the
monetary
relief
under
1981.
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
did
that
because
we
did
not
to
prejudice
someone
if
we
were
wrong
in
our
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
not,
we
were
lawyers
--
mr.
a.
thomas
hunt
your
honor,
we
were
doing
our
best
we
could
for
the
past
applicants.
we
determined
that
their
monitory
claims
were
of
no
value.
we
sought
injunctive
relief
on
their
behalf
and
we
based
the
relief
we
sought
on
the
discrimination
against
them.
i
would
submit
there
was
no
conflict.if
they
had
had
valid
monetary
claims,
we
would
have
pursued
them.
i
think
it
is
important
to
comeback
to
the
point
that
and
emphasis
the
point
that
mr.
justice
brennan
has
pointed
that
the
statement
of
the
issues
to
be
tried
does
concern
past
applicants.
it
is
unfortunate,
i
have
been
able
to
reach
the
1981
point,
i
would
say
only
that
we
believe
johnson
v.
railway
express,
the
thrust
of
that
case
is
that
the
plaintiffs
should
succeeded
on
that
point.
