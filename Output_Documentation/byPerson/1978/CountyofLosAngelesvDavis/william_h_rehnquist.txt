justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stewart,
you
have
undoubtedly
seen
the
solicitor
general's
amicus
brief
in
this
case
suggesting
that
the
case
boils
down
to
a
lot
less
than
it
seem
to
after
the
revised
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit.
are
you
going
to
discuss
that
at
some
point
in
your
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
you
concede
that
you
are
governed
by
title
vii
from
march
1972
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
concedes
that
the
only
gap
in
this
period
was
between
january
and
march
1972,
that
is
that
the
last
time
there
was
any
effort
to
administer
the
test
was
in
january
1972?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
it
be
possible
for
this
court
to
vacate
the
decree
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
on
a
standing
basis
and
simply
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
for
re-framing
of
an
appropriate
remedy,
considering
what
a
small
tail
is
left
of
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
without
going
to
1981.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
without
going
to
1981?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
standing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
the
first
opinion,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
opinion
comes
before
the
first
one
in
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
counsel,
if
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
language
we
have
been
going
over
and
over,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
plaintiffs
class
did
not
include
any
prior
unsuccessful
appraisal
--
plaintiffs
neither
suffered
nor
were
threatened
with
any
injury.
if
you
want
to
upset
that
conclusion,
you
would
have
to
cross
petition
for
certiorari,
would
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
just
would
--
turned
that
around?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wasn't
the
definition
of
class?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
may
be
you
should
find
some
new
clients
and
start
a
new
lawsuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
on
page
45
of
the
appendix,
is
not
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
a
minute
ago
in
response
to
my
question,
which
i
asked
you
in
a
very
leading
form,
the
court
of
appeals
just
turned
it
around
and
then
you
said,
yes,
but
when
you
read
the
class
certification
in
the
judgment,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
turn
it
around,
they
were
just
following
what
the
district
court
had
done?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here
is
a
case
involving
fire
department
in
about
the
third
or
fourth
most
populous
county
in
united
states,
very
significant
issues
in
it
and
you
are
talking
about
an
oversight?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
cases
from
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
about
the
oversight
issue
that
you
just
mentioned,
i
notice
in
the
appendix
at
page
3,
on
paragraph
5
of
your
compliant
that
you
asked
for
relief
of
behalf
of
a
class
composed
of
all
persons
who
are
either
black
or
mexican
and
american
and
who
presently
are
or
will
become
employed
as
firemen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
a
complaint
here,
you
have
a
district
court
opinion
and
you
have
a
court
of
appeals'
opinion
and
they
are
all
unanimous
to
the
effect
that
past
applicants
are
not
represented.
now,
in
my
days
of
practicing
law
that
would
have
about
ended
it
and
you
wouldn't
say
that
on
the
intervening
trial
where
evidence
to
a
different
effect
was
introduced
could
have
possibly
changed
those
three
things
all
coming
down
the
same
way?
