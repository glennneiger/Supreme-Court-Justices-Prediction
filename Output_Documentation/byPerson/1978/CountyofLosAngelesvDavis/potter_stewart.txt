this
plan
was
given
in
1972
–
given
in
1969
and
had
been
given
periodically
back
over
the
years?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
an
identical
exam
or
just
the
same
type
of
exam?
justice
potter
stewart
and
no
evidence
in
years
prior
to
1969
as
to
even
who
were
taken
the
exam,
in
terms
of
ethnic?
justice
potter
stewart
and
only
applicants
would
have
taken
the
examination?
justice
potter
stewart
because
part
of
the
claim,
the
original
claim
in
this
case
was
that
the
discrimination
led
to
very
few
applicants
because
of
the
practice
of
present
members
of
the
fire
department
to
tell
their
friends
and
brothers
and
cousins
about
it
and
let
them
in
the
fire
house
to
get
some
practical
experience
and
to
prepare
for
the
exam
and
so
on,
that
there
was
no
such
recruiting
or
even
knowledge
of
the
availability
in
among
negro
and
spanish
american
groups,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
the
fate
of
that
allegation
was
that
it
was
district
court
do
not
rely
on
it
nor
do
the
court
of
appeals?

second
paragraph
of
footnote
6.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
looking
at
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
the
certiorari.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
no
13-34
in
there.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
13-37.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
okay,
you
are
getting
to
defendants
of
challenge.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
teamsters
case
was
a
government
pattern
or
practice
case,
was
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
under
title
vii?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
that
the
opinion
should
be
read
in
the
realization
that,
that
is
what
the
case
was?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hunt,
your
argument
been
interrupted,
you
and
your
colleague
have
used
the
phrase
“the
oversight,”
i
do
not
know
how
many
times
during
the
course
of
the
this
argument,
what
do
you
understand
the
coverage
of
that
phrase
to
be,
the
oversight?
justice
potter
stewart
where,
in
the
complaint
or
in
the
class
certification,
where?
justice
potter
stewart
and
are
we
to
assume
on
recall
of
an
oversight,
this
is
something
that
you
said
your
brother
on
the
other
side
and
you
worked
this
out
together
that
he
would
freely
and
quite
willingly
do
and
say,
oh,
yes,
this
was
just
an
oversight
and
that
the
district
court
would
freely
and
quite
willingly
do
saying,
oh,
yes,
this
was
just
an
oversight.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
did
not
understand
the
answer
to
mine
so
far.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
