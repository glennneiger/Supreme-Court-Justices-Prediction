except
there's
talking
about
a
different
rate
of
interest
for
small
loan
companies.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
section
would
prevent
the
minnesota
from
passing
a
statute
that
would
require
iowa
banks
to
charge
a
higher
rate
of
interest
than
minnesota
banks
or
lower
rate
in
minnesota
banks?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
say
that
the
section,
this
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
interstate
transaction,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
an
interstate
transaction?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
as
far
as
that
section
is
concerned,
minnesota
could
require
an
iowa
bank
to
charge
a
higher
rate
or
a
lower
rate
than
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
mean
in
minnesota?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know,
but
could
it
require
the
bank
to
charge
a
higher
rate
or
a
lower
rate
or
either
one
than
a
minnesota
bank,
when
it's
doing
business
in
minnesota?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
the
section,
you
say
it
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
protect
the
minnesota
bank?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
that
as
far
as
that
section
is
concerned,
minnesota
could
require
the
iowa
bank
doing
business
in
minnesota
to
charge
you
to
the
higher
rate
or
a
lower
rate
than
minnesota
banks?
justice
potter
stewart
by
virtue
of
what
section?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
does
apply
the
interstate
transaction?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
okay
if
one
precedes
on
the
assumption.
i
mean
your
--
your
argument
follows
if
one
precedes
on
the
assumption
that
the
bank
is
located
in
nebraska
and
only
in
nebraska.
but
what
if
the
bank
is
located
in
minnesota?
justice
potter
stewart
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
so
a
bank
could
have
a
single
location.
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
that
now
true?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
how
about
the
bougas
case?
justice
potter
stewart
or
one
single
place.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bork,
the
complaint
in
the
case,
which
is
referred
to
on
page
a
(3)
of
the
supreme
court
minnesota's
opinion,
paragraph
3
says,
“defendant
first
of
omaha
service
corporation
will
participate
in
the
system
by
entering
into
agreements
with
minnesota
merchants
and
minnesota
banks,
which
will
govern
the
participation
of
these
merchants
and
banks
in
the
system.”
now,
doesn't
that
sound
to
me
like
a
rumor
but
just
virtually
the
right
and
favorite
bank
in
omaha?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
are
the
--
what
are
the
agreements
which
the
service
corporation
enters
into
that
are
referred
to
in
paragraph
3
of
the
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
if
--
if
it
should
be
found
that
--
that
your
client
bank,
that
omaha
bank
had
located
itself
in
minnesota
by
opening
up
this
wholly-owned
subsidiary
agent,
then
85
clearly
would
apply,
wouldn't
it,
to
--
and
make
the
minnesota
rate
of
interest
applicable
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
it's
done
by
that
wholly-owned
subsidiary
with
minnesota
residence.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
where
--
no,
no,
not
wherever
it
has
some
activity,
not
where
it
does
business
by
mail
but
--
but
wherever
it
opens
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
for
this
business.
they
after
all
--
the
minnesota
court
--
the
minnesota
statute
has
--
says
that
the
defendant
has
to
be
a
bank.
the
minnesota
court
in
this
case
apparently
held
that
this
subsidiary
was
a
bank
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right
at
the
tail-end
of
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
wouldn't
need
to
go
that
far.
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
--
you
think
that
the
--
before
minnesota
law
would
govern
at
all
or
the
bank
could
be
said
to
be
located
in
minnesota
is
if
they're
--
if
it
were
extending
credit
in
minnesota.
