mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
only
substantive
question
in
this
case
is
actually
whether
section
85
of
the
national
bank
act
applies
to
interstate
loan
transactions.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
as
a
legal
matter
is
quite
clear,
that
absolutely
and
it
clearly
applies,
i
think
beyond
doubt.
but
so
much
of
this
discussion
today
has
been
essentially
legislative
cast
somewhat
as
legal
argument.
it's
really
legislative
asking
this
court
to
change
the
reading
that
section
85
has
had
for
over
a
hundred
years
in
order
to
protect
minnesota's
public
policy.
and
i
think
i
have
to
spend
a
moment
characterizing
this
case
before
going
directly
into
the
understanding
of
section
85,
and
that
is
this.
nebraska
is
not
exporting
interest
rates.
i
think
it
is
more
accurate
to
say
that
minnesota
is
exporting
its
law
to
a
nebraska
bank.
a
minnesota
resident
who
wants
a
line
of
credit
from
a
nebraska
bank,
we
are
told
by
nebraska
--
by
minnesota
i'm
sorry,
may
drive
or
fly
to
omaha,
get
the
omaha
credit
card
and
bring
it
back
and
use
in
minnesota
or
any
other
state
in
the
union,
but
he
may
not
engage
in
that
same
transaction
by
mail
and
that's
all
of
this
case
comes
down
to,
because
what
happens
here
is,
a
minnesota
resident
is
told
and
made
aware
by
a
service
corporation
which
extends
no
credit
to
anybody,
that
those
credit
cards
are
available
in
omaha.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
saying
that
anybody
who
wants
a
first
national
bank
of
omaha
credit
card
sends
an
application
to
omaha,
nebraska.
the
application
is
passed
upon
in
omaha,
nebraska.
the
credit
is
extended
in
omaha,
nebraska
and
the
debt
is
repaid
in
omaha,
nebraska.
and
what
we're
being
told
today
is
that
that
would
be
all
right
if
the
minneapolis
resident
drove
to
omaha
and
got
his
credit
card
but
not
if
he
sent
a
letter
or
an
application
asking
for
his
credit
card.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
when
the
bank
pays
the
restaurant
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
this
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
yes,
that
happens
in
omaha.
now,
it's
conceivable
that
if
a
minneapolis
resident
went
to
new
york
and
use
his
credit
card
in
a
hotel
in
new
york,
new
york
might
say,
“aha,
its
public
policy
should
govern
that
transaction.”
and
then
we
would
have
a
three-way
fight.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you
mean
a
different
kind
of
a
statute?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
could
happen.
and
i
suppose
if
every
state
in
union
said
that
every
use
of
a
credit
card
in
our
state
to
purchase
something
is
governed
by
our
usury
laws,
i
think
the
credit
card
business
would
cease
to
exist
because
every
time
somebody
cross
the
country,
the
credit
card
companies
would
have
to
compute
interest
for
every
different
state
and
have
to
see
where
every
transaction
was
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
minnesota
says
that
if
our
--
if
you
ask
our
customers
to
write
to
you
to
get
a
credit
card
approved
in
omaha,
you
have
to
comply
with
minnesota
interest
rates
even
though
the
entire
making
of
the
loan,
the
entire
extension
of
the
credit
and
everything
about
that
transaction
is
centered
in
omaha
and
even
though,
and
i
should
express
this,
that
credit
card
will
be
used
anywhere
in
the
country
and
many
nations
abroad.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
to
make
phone
call,
to
make
it
known
that
if
you
send
an
application
to
the
first
national
bank
in
omaha,
we
will
consider
it
and
perhaps
extend
your
credit
card.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
that
would
be
to
apply
minnesota
law
through
a
subsidiary
to
a
nebraska
banking
transaction.
now,
it
could
enjoin
if
that
was
a
deceptive
practice
or
something
of
that
sort,
but
we're
not
taking
about
that.
we're
talking
about
send
a
letter
to
us
in
nebraska
and
we
will
consider
extending
your
credit
which
is
exactly
the
same
kind
of
transaction
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
should
say
that
the
omaha
plan
has
a
lot
of
advantages,
that
the
minneapolis
plan
does
not
if
you
are
a
prompt
payer,
if
you
engaged
in
a
transaction
for
the
restaurant
on
september
15,
get
billed
on
october
1
and
pay
before
october
25,
you
will
play
no
interest
rate
to
the
omaha
national
bank,
but
the
other
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
but
the
other
plan,
mr.
justice
marshal,
charges
you
a
$10.00
or
a
$15.00
charge
whether
or
not
you're
a
prompt
payer
so
that
it
is
the
advantage
of
prompt
payers
to
use
the
omaha
--
card.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
the
bill
is
mailed
--
the
payment
of
the
bill
is
mailed
to
omaha.
there
is
no
--
the
service
corporation,
which
is
the
party
here,
does
not
extend
credit
and
does
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
you
must
mail
your
check
or
your
money
order
to
omaha.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
does
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice.
(voice
overlap)
no,
it's
been
mostly
by
mail
or
telephone
making
applications
available
in
that
sense.
now,
i
should
say
one
word
about
this
enormous
competitive
disadvantage
which
the
marquette
national
bank
thinks
it
lives
under
and
that
competitive
disadvantage
turns
out
to
be
really
entirely
that
the
omaha
bank
through
its
agent
can
advertise
a
free
credit
card.
the
marquette
bank
could
have
advertised
equally
a
33%
lower
interest
rate.
this
entire
case
--
this
entire
attempt
to
change
the
structure
of
the
national
banking
system
turns
out
to
be
a
fight
over
alternative
advertising
techniques.
i
really
think
the
marquette
bank
would
have
done
better
to
take
their
case
to
an
advertising
agency
than
to
a
law
firm.
but
that's
what
it
comes
down
to
and
i
would
like
if
i
may
return
to
the
law
of
the
case,
which
has
a
presentation
and
somewhat
slighter
i
think,
and
i
think
it
is
clear
that
section
85
of
the
national
bank
act
applies
to
interstate
transactions
and
for
over
a
hundred
years,
a
banking
industry
has
assumed
that.
it's
had
every
reason
to
think
so
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
tiffany
case
and
because
of
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
sir.
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
if
you
take
a
look
at
tiffany
and
then
at
the
clear
language
of
section
85,
which
appears
on
page
14
of
our
respondent's
brief,
the
blue
brief,
the
statute
provides
in
pertinent
part
the
national
bank
--
i'm
freely
translating
it
until
i
get
to
the
right
word,
the
pertinent
word
--
the
national
bank
may
take
interest
or
charge
on
any
loan
or
discount
made
and
that
includes
every
loan
or
discount
made
by
a
national
bank
so
that
the
plain
text
meaning
of
section
85
is
that
if
a
loan
or
a
discount
is
made
by
a
national
bank,
section
85
governs
it.
now,
i
would
think
it
would
take
a
rather
strong
or
rather
compelling
showing
in
the
light
of
the
tiffany
case
over
a
hundred
years
ago
in
a
consistent
line
of
cases
following
tiffany,
in
the
light
of
the
clear
wording
of
section
85,
and
in
the
light
of
the
understood
practice
of
the
financial
industry
in
this
area,
and
i
want
to
stress
that
because
the
financial
industry
has
built
up
around
the
settled
expectation
that
85
applies.
and
we
are
now
talking
about
an
industry
affected
by
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
it
did,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it's
the
predecessor
section.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
of
course
at
the
time
the
1864
act
was
written,
branch
banking
was
absolutely
prohibited.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
so
that
one
would
have
to
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
single
location.
uh
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
is
still
true.
we
--
we
may
--
we
not
--
may
now
branch
within
the
state.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
about
the
bougas
case,
citizens
&
others
against
bougas
said
i
think
entirely
on
reasoning
that
i
think
applies
to
this
case
that
there
is
no
particular
reason
to
confine
the
word
“located”
so
that
a
bank
cannot
be
sued
at
its
branches
because
all
of
the
policy
reasons
against
--
or
for
requiring
the
word
“located”
to
mean
sue
the
bank
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--
have
now
changed,
so
those
same
reasons
permit
suit
at
the
branch
banks.
in
this
case,
those
policy
reasons,
as
i
hoped
to
show,
press
in
--
overwhelmingly
in
the
opposite
direction.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
a
really
enormously
complex,
and
i
should
say
enormously
highly
regulated
at
state
and
federal
levels,
industry
is
involved
here
build
around
--
in
part,
build
around
the
principle
that
section
85
applies
to
this,
and
you
now
have
an
industry
which
has
--
governed
by
this
case
alone
which
has
annually
does
hundreds
of
billions,
perhaps
trillions
of
dollars
in
credit
transactions.
this
is
not
a
credit
card
case.
this
is
a
case
that
applies
to
all
interstate
loans
because
section
85
is
not
a
credit
card
statute.
and
if
section
85
has
no
application
to
interstate
transactions,
it
has
no
application
to
any
interstate
transaction.
for
example,
interstate
mortgage
money,
which
is
a
very
big
industry,
would
suddenly
be
thrown
into
chaos
by
a
decision
that
the
--
the
state
of
where
the
bank
is
located
no
longer
governs
the
interest
rate.
interstate
automobile
loans,
which
are
very
common,
have
been
governed
by
section
85.
this
is
not
a
credit
card
case;
this
is
an
interstate
lending
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
given,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
--
i
think
given
the
tiffany
case
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no,
i
was
about
to
make
a
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
was
at
part,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
to
suggest
that
there
was
some
reason
for
the
banks
to
have
felt
this
way
given
the
tiffany
case,
given
the
plain
language,
any
loan
made
by
national
bank,
which
is
in
section
85.
and
then
given
the
practice,
which
is
going
up
and
was
unchallenged
until
recently,
the
form
books
in
which
these
loans
are
made,
the
available
form
book
all
specify
the
law
of
the
state
of
the
bank
as
the
law
of
providing
the
interest
rate,
which
has
been
understood
in
this
industry.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
[laughter]
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
was
just
suggesting
that
the
form
books
are
merely
a
reflection
of
an
understanding
that
this
industry
has
been
built
upon.
and
if
i
had
no
other
argument,
i
--
even
if
it
were
unreasonable
for
the
banking
industry
to
have
construed
section
85
the
way
they
did,
i
would
stand
here
before
you
and
argue
that
that
unreasonable
construction
having
gone
on
so
long
ought
to
be
adhered
to
because
you
have
not
the
information
before
you
to
know
what
new
statute
to
legislate
through
interpretation
of
section
85
and
indeed,
you
have
not
the
options
under
section
85
to
legislate
wisely
in
this
field.
for
example,
the
kinds
of
legislative
problems
were
being
given
here
by
the
state
of
minnesota
and
by
the
marquette
national
bank
for
consideration.
perhaps,
the
best
national
rule
--
i
don't
know,
perhaps
the
best
national
rule
would
be
a
single
credit
card
rate
for
all
credit
cards
legislated
federally.
that
might
be
the
way
to
handle
this.
that
is
not
an
option
that's
available
to
this
court
under
any
conceivable
reading
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--
of
section
85.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
certainly
do
agree
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
doubt
--
i
doubt
that
you
can
gamble
by
mail.
but
once
it
is
--
what
is
being
said
here
is
that
a
minneapolis
resident
may
not
write
to
an
out
of
state
bank
for
a
line
of
credit,
which
he
intends
to
use
all
over
the
county
because
minnesota
follows
him.
minnesota
brands
the
residents
so
that
minnesota
law
goes
everywhere
he
goes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
that's
so,
but
i
don't
think
minnesota
can
shelter
and
protect
them
when
they
leave
the
state
in
effect
to
do
their
transactions
and
when
a
federal
law
reads
directly
upon
that
transaction.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
nebraska
has
no
branch
(voice
overlap).
this
is
a
service
corporation.
it
does
no
banking
business
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
have
people
in
minnesota
who
--
who
make
minnesotans
aware
that
they
may
write,
may
send
an
application
to
nebraska
for
a
credit
card.
that's
what
they
do.
it's
--
it
is
a
--
i'm
sure
that
throughout
our
history,
bankers
have
made
known
to
lend
to
possible
borrowers
in
other
states,
that
credit
was
available
in
wall
street
or
in
philadelphia
or
in
boston.
those
were
financial
centers
back
in
the
colonies
and
it
was
made
known
that
that
credit
was
available
in
by
mail
or
by
travel.
borrowers
came
for
that
purpose
and
we
had
interstate
lending
that
far
back,
and
that
this
case
is
no
different.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
[laughter]
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
they
do
--
it's
licit
people
to
sign
up
but
no
credit
transaction
takes
place
in
minnesota.
every
aspect
of
that,
the
application,
the
approval,
the
extension
of
the
credit,
and
the
payment
all
takes
place
in
nebraska
where
the
bank
is
located.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
that
a
--
that
a
bank
will
--
when
these
sales
drafts
come
in
that
it
will
send
them
through
the
ordinary
bank
channels
to
omaha
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
usually,
the
bank
is
not
a
party.
it's
just
a
service
corporation.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
and
the
service
corporation
will
make
an
agreement
with
a
restaurant
or
with
another
bank.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
but
it
extends
no
credit.
it
makes
no
loans.
it
does
nothing
that
would
come
under
section
85
or
indeed
under
the
minnesota
statute.
what
is
happening
here
is
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
no,
no,
the
override
--
you
mean
the
discount
for
the
merchant?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
runs
between
1.5%
and
4%
now,
it
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
probably
so.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
haven't
characterized
it,
but
i
don't
think
it's
an
extension
of
a
loan
which
--
which
we
have
to
worry
about
whether
it
falls
on
section
85
or
not
because
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
interest
rate
charge
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
right.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
but
the
merchant
gets
a
discount
or
pays
a
discount.
but
what
we're
talking
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
interest
rate
paid
by
the
car
user
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
that
is
the
section
85
issue,
and
i
would
like
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--
to
make
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
what
counsel
just
said,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
that's
what
--
i
took
that
from
--
from
counsel's
statement
just
now.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
understand
that,
but
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
the
credit
is
extended
when
the
omaha
bank
pays
the
merchant,
whether
that
merchant
is
in
minnesota
or
iowa
or
new
york
or
los
angeles
or
bangkok.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
credit
is
extended
at
that
point.
is
it
--
it
is
extended
at
omaha,
nebraska,
and
it
is
repaid.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
was
my
point,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
minnesota
was
saying
we
don't
attempt
to
follow
our
residents
if
they
drive
or
cross
the
state
line.
but
if
they
write
across
the
state
line,
our
law
goes
with
them.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
because
of
section
85
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
you
mean
if
they
entered
into
a
contract
about
what
law
applied?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
on
the
choice
of
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
under
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--
of
that
sort,
i
would
think
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
would
much
prefer
if
i
may
to
rely
upon
the
federal
statute,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
was
trying
to
--
my
point
about
that,
and
i've
spent
much,
much
too
time
developing
it
i'm
afraid,
is
that
we
were
started
with
a
characterization
of
this
case
which
was
intended
to
make
what
happened
sounds
very
unfair
as
if
nebraska
was
invading
minnesota
with
an
interest
rate,
and
i'm
just
trying
to
point
out
that
what
happens
here
is
if
somebody
goes
to
omaha
or
writes
to
omaha
and
every
step
in
the
transaction
takes
place
in
omaha
--
and
that's
all
i
wanted
to
--
i
merely
wanted
to
place
the
case
in
some
perspective.
when
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
there's
no
difference
whatsoever.
the
minnesota
statute,
i
am
told
by
counsel,
makes
one.
but
i
really
--
my
argument
really
is
the
section
85
governs.
i
have
already
made
the
point
i
think
that
its
plain
language
governs
any
text.
now,
the
question
is
there
are
only
two
arguments
made
against
that,
and
each
of
them
is
completely
auspicious.
the
first
one
is
that
there
is
a
policy
of
competitive
equality
which
has
to
be
read
into
section
85,
auspicious
because
that
policy
derives
from
later
enactments
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
section
85.
and
if
you'll
look
at
the
marquette
bank's
brief,
marquette
bank
itself
on
page
13
as
i
recall
agrees
that
a
state
bank
--
pardon
me,
a
national
bank
in
a
state
gets
the
rate
that
the
general
lender
gets
or
the
rate
that
the
state
bank
gets,
whichever
is
higher.
that's
not
a
policy
of
equality.
that
on
the
face
of
the
statute
is
a
policy
of
favored
lender.
now,
that
is
exactly
what
tiffany
held,
and
tiffany
was
right.
now
it
said
--
but
since
then,
we
had
a
policy
of
competitive
equality,
which
somehow
it
would
be
read
backwards,
to
overcome
the
language
as
85.
in
fact,
that
is
not
true.
if
you
will
look
at
section
85,
you
will
see
that
in
1933,
it
was
amended
to
give
national
banks
but
not
state
banks
freedom
from
state
regulation
by
giving
national
banks
the
option
of
charging
1%
above
the
federal
discount
rate,
which
option
was
not
extended
to
state
banks.
and
what
that
means
is
at
the
beginning,
competitive
equality
as
to
discount,
as
to
interest
rates
was
never
intended
by
congress.
competitive
equality
as
to
interest
rates
is
not
intended
by
congress
today.
and
i
think
i've
sufficiently
pointed
out
that
there
is
no
competitive
inequality
in
fact
in
this
case
because
it's
a
dispute
over
advertising
techniques.
they
have
a
technique
they
could
use,
as
well
as
the
one
that
we
have
used.
the
other
argument
is
that
congress
simply
could
not
have
intended
section
85
to
apply
to
an
interstate
transaction
because
there
was
no
interstate
lending
back
in
those
days
or
nothing
to
speak
of.
that
assertion
is
incredible.
before
this
--
before
the
american
revolution,
there
was
inter-colonial
lending.
in
their
book,
the
stamp
act
crisis,
helen
and
edmund
morgan
point
out
that
the
stamp
act
crisis
cause
the
closing
of
the
colonial
courts
and
that
states
are
colonies
rather
such
as
connecticut
were
delighted
because
that
meant
out
of
colony
creditors
couldn't
enforce
their
judgments
in
connecticut.
before
the
american
revolution,
there
was
an
international
trading.
london
factories
financed
our
tobacco
trade.
george
washington
himself
was
engaged
in
that
kind
of
financing.
when
we
come
to
the
constitution
itself,
it's
clear
that
interstate
lending
follows
interstate
commerce,
builds
an
exchange
and
so
forth,
which
i
mentioned
specifically
in
section
85.
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
holding
a
constitutional
convention
was
to
deal
with
control
of
the
federal
level
over
interstate
commerce
and
it
is
quite
clear
i
think
that
in
the
writing
of
a
constitution,
the
framers
were
contemplating
interstate
lending
because
they
took
care
to
make
it
a
federal
power
to
write
a
uniform
bankruptcy
law
obviously
to
prevent
discrimination
against
out
of
state
creditors
by
--
by
states.
now,
if
we
come
to
the
period
after
the
revolution,
i
refer
simply
to
the
brief
file
by
the
first
national
bank
of
chicago,
which
gives
examples
of
bank
interstate
lending
in
the
1830's.
i
would
refer
you,
the
court,
also
to
carl
swisher's
history
of
this
court
in
the
taney
years,
the
homes
device
history
of
this
court
in
which
he
points
out
that
in
1839,
this
court
was
deciding
the
right
of
corporations
to
deal
in
--
bills
of
exchange
in
states
other
than
where
they
were
incorporated.
and
he
points
out
that
president
van
buren
had
to
address
congress
in
the
special
session
about
the
problem
posed
by
bills
of
exchange,
who
transferred
capital
from
one
region
of
the
country
to
the
other.
if
that
congress
didn't
understand
that
interstate
lending
was
going
on
all
around
it,
it
must
have
been
incredibly
obtuse
or
else,
it
was
hermetically
sealed,
and
it
was
neither.
and
once
we
assume
that
congress
understood
that
interstate
lending
existed
around
it
in
1864,
then
we
cannot
assume
that
congress
for
the
only
time
in
history
reversed
the
constitutional
pattern
and
chose
to
legislate
entirely
as
to
intrastate
transactions
and
leave
to
the
states
the
control
of
interstate
transactions.
that
turns
the
thing
entirely
upside
down.
so
i
think
there
is
no
--
i
would
close
with
a
remark
that
this
industry
could
be
thrown
into
chaos
if
we
have
now
--
not
just
the
credit
card
industry,
the
entire
industry
--
if
we
have
now
to
take
the
48
billion
credit
card
holders
out
there,
follow
their
residences
as
they
move
around
the
country,
recompute
interests,
recalculate
the
way
it's
done,
follow
the
laws
of
all
the
jurisdictions,
i
don't
know
whether
this
kind
of
business
or
the
interstate
mortgage
business
or
the
automobile
loan
business
is
going
to
be
doable.
there
are
enormous
costs
involved
that
simply
aren't
in
this
record
that
ought
to
be
taken
into
account
by
congress.
congress
has
amended
this
section
85
many
times.
congress
has
taken
up
the
credit
card
issue
in
terms
of
how
you
compute
these
rates.
in
1977,
a
bill
was
introduced
on
that.
it
is
not
as
if
congress
was
inactive.
and
we
have
a
trillion-dollar
--
many
trillion-dollar
interstate
loan
businesses
which
simply
ought
not
to
be
thrown
into
confusion
by
overturning
a
law
that
has
been
so
clear
and
been
regarded
so
clear
and
have
been
interpreted
so
consistently
for
over
a
hundred
years.
and
for
that
reason,
because
of
the
law,
because
of
tiffany,
because
of
the
understanding,
because
of
the
financial
industry
that
has
been
built
around
it,
we
ask
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
be
affirmed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
suppose
--
let
me
repeat,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
i
think
the
policy
reasons
that
led
to
the
expansion
of
the
word
“located”
in
bougas
lead
precisely
to
the
confinement
of
the
word
“located”
here
because
you're
going
to
offset
a
major
industry
without
knowing
exactly
what
is
happening,
without
knowing
the
result
of
the
ruling,
without
having
the
options
of
the
information
before
you
so
that
bougas
i
think
reads
against
it.
but
if
one
said
that
a
bank
is
located
wherever
it
does
--
has
some
activity
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
a
point
that
has
to
be
raised
yet
below
because
i
think
we
have
problems
under
section
86,
the
venue
provision
by
treating
first
of
omaha
as
a
bank.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
that
wasn't
decided
below
our
argued
--
so
we
won't
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
the
--
the
problem
would
not
be
solved
by
expanding
the
word
“located”
when
you
incorporate
a
subsidiary
to
do
this
because
obviously,
a
subsidiary
doesn't
have
to
be
incorporated
to
do
this.
i
think
the
only
way
the
word
“located”
could
be
enlarged
in
order
to
take
care
of
that,
we
say
that
anytime
a
bank
does
business
across
a
state
line,
it
is
located
across
a
state
line.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
i
don't
think
the
--
i
don't
think
mr.
justice
stewart,
with
respect
to
the
policy
would
be
consistent,
unless
you
did
go
that
far.
and
if
you
did
go
that
far
or
even
this
far,
you
would
have
really
enormous
impacts
upon
a
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don't
think
these
--
the
selling
of
credit
cards
would
in
fact
be
the
making
of
a
loan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
it
engaged
in
the
act
of
making
a
loan
in
minnesota,
which
would
require
a
branch,
it
would
be
then
located
in
minnesota
but
it
is
not
located
within
the
--
within
section
85
and
cannot
be
because
it's
not
permitted
by
law
to
branch
in
to
minnesota.
but
all
banks
do
business
across
state
lines
and
all
banks
will
be
affected
by
a
ruling
that
--
of
this
sort.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don't
think
the
american
bankers
association
has
the
on
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
there's
one
by
the
consumer
banker
association
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
which
is
an
association
of
banks
and
one
by
the
first
national
bank
of
chicago.
i
cannot
answer
you
as
to
why
other
banks
have
not
filed
amicus
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
since
section
85
is
certainly
not
a
credit
card
but
an
international
--
but
a
loan
statute
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
would
certainly
control
all
those
things.
i
cannot
--
i
cannot
offer
you
an
explanation,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
is
the
--
mr.
justice
white,
if
i
may
--
if
i
can
find
it,
there
is
in
our
brief
the
comptroller
of
the
currencies
regulation
which
rests
upon
tiffany
--
do
you
know
the
page
--
which
rests
upon
tiffany
and
states
the
policy
of
tiffany.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it's
12
cfr,
there
is
a
comptroller
of
the
currency
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i'm
not
aware
of
how
old
this.
it's
been
around
for
a
while
but
i'm
not
aware
of
how
old
it
is.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
would
feel
more
confident
if
could
locate
the

mr.
robert
h.
bork
bottom
of

the
--
wait.
well,
it
says
formerly
recognized
but
i
don't
see
the
quote
there
at
the
bottom,
page
17.
it
is
i
regret
to
say
mr.
justice
white
that
i
cannot
locate
it
swiftly.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
in
the
briefs.
