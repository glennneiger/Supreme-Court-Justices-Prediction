the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
1258,
minnesota
against
the
first
of
omaha
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
allyn,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
would
have
thought
that
you'd
more
business
if
you
charge
lower
rates?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
in
terms
of
competition.
perhaps,
it's
just
the
use
of
that
word
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nobody
else
is.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
all
the
parties
were
eighth
circuit
people
were
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
omaha
still
has
its
small
loan
act,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
allows
36%
in
the
aggregate
or
something
in
that
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
troyer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
undertook
your
friend,
your
colleague
to
say
that
the
come
on
was
that
the
omaha
bank
could
advertise
no
membership
fee
initially,
not
forget
the
customers
enter
the
house
and
after
they
fined
they
were
paying
18%
instead
of
12%?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
how
you
explain
my
confusion
about
competitive
advantage,
at
least
to
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
expired
now,
mr.
troyer.
thank
you.
mr.
bork.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
telling
us
that
all
of
these
transactions
are
made
in
this
way,
mr.
bork?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
nebraska
bank
advertise
in
minnesota?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bork.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
that
in
minnesota
or
any
other
state
places
a
statutory
limit
on
interest
rates
and
declares
that
with
certain
penalties
that
are
anything
beyond
the
--
that
is
usury
that
what
their
state
is
doing
is
expressing
an
important
social
policy
to
protect
its
citizens?
that
is
in
--
in
general.
would
you
agree
that
that's
the
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
say
that
doesn't
stop
them
from
gambling
by
mail
if
they
have
a
mail
gambling
apparatus
in
las
vegas.
if
you
can
--
i
don't
know
if
you
can
gamble
by
mail
but
--
is
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
minnesota
may
be
--
would
put
it
in
a
little
different
light
that
might
say
minnesota
is
going
to
try
to
shelter
and
protect
its
native
citizens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
of
course,
there
aren't
really
in
the
state
really,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
in
the
state
when
they
have
a
branch,
a
nebraska
branch
in
minnesota?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
was
using
branch
not
in
a
technical
banking
sense
but
they
--
they
have
an
arm
under
minnesota?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
77-1265,
marquette
national
bank
against
the
first
omaha
service
corporation
and
the
consolidated
