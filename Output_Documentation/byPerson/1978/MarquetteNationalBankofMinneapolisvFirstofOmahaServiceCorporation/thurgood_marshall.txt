mr.
troyer,
i've
missed
something.
why
didn't
you
just
go
ahead
and
use
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
normally,
other
state
i
know,
when
somebody
was
charged
as
there
is
interest,
they
manage
to
get
indicted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
the
bank
brought
it,
the
individual
people,
once
you
tell
them
that
they
get
all
their
money
back,
plus
they're
very
glad
to
join
in
a
suit,
aren't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
is
that
a
great
problem
with
the
cause
of
action
that
says
that
when
people
charge
extra
high
prices,
it
interferes
the
competition
and
the
free
marketplace
and
all
of
those
other
trade
places?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
a
gasoline
company
start
to
selling
gas
for
$3.00
a
gallon,
would
the
other
companies
object?
this
isn't
limited
to
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
be
that
if
some
resident
in
minnesota
insist
on
paying
more
than
the
going
rate
of
interest
and
prefers
to
pay
18%
instead
of
the
going
rate,
then
the
only
way
to
do
it
is
either
to
mail
it
to
--
or
to
go
to
this
office
in
minnesota.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
for
mails
on
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
problem
i
have
is
the
18%
interest
when
given
to
your
office
in
minneapolis
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
pay
your
bill
in
the
office
in
minneapolis?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
but
--
and
you
can't
pay
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
the
way
you
get
around
the
usury
law.
