justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
respect
to
that
counsel,
would
the
minnesota's
purposes
be
served
if
the
court
had
simply
enjoined
the
subsidiary
in
minnesota
from
carrying
on
this
kind
of
conduct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
felt
not
even
the
subsidiary
could
be
enjoined.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
weren't
happy,
obviously.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
those
are
really
minimum
context
cases
i
think.
here,
you
have
a
subsidiary.
actually,
it
took
out
papers
in
minnesota.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
was
more
then
just
a
national
bank
crossing
state
lines.
it
actually
incorporated
the
subsidiary
in
minnesota.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
someone
from
worthington,
minnesota
went
down
to
omaha
and
borrowed
from
the
first
national,
would
the
first
national
be
entitled
to
charge
him
a
nebraska
rate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
business
is
so
heavily
centered
in
omaha,
why
did
they
incorporate
a
subsidiary
in
minnesota?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
minnesota
card
could
have
enjoined
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
that
tiffany
is
a
holding
to
that
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
--
you're
saying
then
that
if
the
banks
have
construed
section
85
this
way
for
so
long,
we
should
construe
it
that
way?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
that's
not
tiffany
you
agree
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
all
means.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
really
think
form
books
should
be
an
important
part
of
our
decisional
apparatus?
