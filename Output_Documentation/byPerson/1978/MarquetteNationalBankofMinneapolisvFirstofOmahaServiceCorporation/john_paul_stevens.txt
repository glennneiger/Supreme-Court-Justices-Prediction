justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
troyer,
the
amicus
brief
filed
here
by
the
conference
of
state
bank
supervisors
makes
alternatively
at
least
different
argument
as
you
know,
makes
three
first
of
all
as
the
court
to
overrule
tiffany
and
then
it
says
even
if
tiffany
is
not
overruled,
there
are
at
least
two
alternative
grounds
on
which
your
position
can
be
and
should
be
vindicated.
first,
assuming
that
a
bank
can
only
be
located
in
one
place
and
here
the
bank
is
located
in
nebraska
that
85
is
simply
inapplicable
to
business,
it
does
anywhere
else
except
to
where
it
is
located.
and
that's
--
as
i
understand,
it
is
in
your
argument.
but
secondly,
it
says
particularly
now,
in
the
light
of
citizens
and
southern
national
bank
against
bougas
that
a
bank
can
be
located
in
more
than
one
place
and
that
this
bank
is
located
in
nebraska
and
when
it
moved
into
your
state
of
minnesota,
it's
also
located
there.
and
therefore,
by
the
very
terms
of
85,
for
its
minnesota
business,
it
is
governed
by
your
law,
since
minnesota
is
where
it's
located
for
the
purpose
of
that
business.
you
have
mentioned
that
argument
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
didn't
hear
you
make
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
argument
is
really
made
only
in
the
--
so
far,
as
i've
heard
today
in
the
brief,
this
amicus
brief
of
which
you
have
referred,
i
haven't
heard
and
made
orally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
don't
have
to
because
you
just
stated
it.
but
do
you
disavow
that
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bork.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
go
back
if
i
may
to
your
very
beginning.
you
said,
and
i
may
well
be
right
but
i'm
just
going
to
try
to
think
it
through,
that
in
one
transaction
where
the
card
user
goes
to
nebraska
and
signs
the
--
gets
the
card
comes
back.
everything
that's
done
with
that
card
will
be
a
nebraska
transaction.
it
would
be
--
be
exempt
from
the
minnesota
usury
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
--
that's
perfectly
clear,
is
it,
even
they
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
--
of
any
cases
so
held?
i
mean
the
thing
that
pull
a
trouble,
i'm
just
trying
to
think
it
through
myself,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
extension
of
credit
on
which
interest
is
paid
does
not
occur
until
so
many
days
after
a
purchase
of
a
meal
or
something
like
that
in
minnesota
or
wherever
it's
being
used.
the
extension
of
credit
is
not
when
you
sign
the
--
you
get
the
line
of
credit
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then,
is
not
credit
extended
in
minnesota
whether
or
not
the
card
is
gotten
by
mail
or
by
a
personal
visit
to
nebraska?
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
true,
if
it's
--
if
it's
omaha
rather
than
minnesota,
isn't
it
equally
omaha
whether
or
not
the
credit
card
is
obtained
by
mail
as
opposed
by
a
personal
visit
to
omaha?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
under
your
view
if
you're
correct,
as
i
understand
you,
neither
transaction
would
be
subject
to
the
minnesota
usury
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no,
even
entirely
apart
from
section
85.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
the
contract
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
contract
is
whether
it's
made
in
by
a
personal
visit
or
by
mail.
is
it
when
you
buy
a
man
--
buy
a
meal,
you
will
get
credit
extended
to
you
from
nebraska,
if
i
understand
you
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
just
not
subject
to
the
minnesota
law
under
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
regardless
of
the
section
85.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
don't
even
rely
on
the
federal
statute
if
your
presentation
is
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
just
don't
--
it's
just
something
i
haven't
quite
followed
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
or
do
you
not
contend
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
transaction
by
mail
and
transaction
by
personal
visit
in
omaha?
