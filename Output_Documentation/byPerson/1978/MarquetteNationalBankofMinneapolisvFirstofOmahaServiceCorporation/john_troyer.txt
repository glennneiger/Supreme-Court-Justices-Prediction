mr.
john
troyer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
couple
of
questions
that
were
asked
here.
in
terms
of
the
competitive
disadvantage
which
the
market
national
bank
finds
itself,
it
charges
a
12%
rate
and
a
$15.00
membership
fee
or
did
until
it
so
its
program.
the
omaha
bank
comes
in
here
at
18%
rate.
what
is
the
competitor
disadvantage
to
the
market
bank
as
distinguished
from
disadvantage
to
the
minnesota
consumer?
the
disadvantage
to
the
market
bank
is
number
one,
obviously
it
cannot
charge
an
18%
rate,
it
cannot
get
the
profit
yield
of
an
18%
rate.
but
more
precisely
a
bank
which
can
charge
a
higher
rate
of
interest
has
tremendous
flexibility
in
advantage
in
terms
of
advertising
in
terms
of
soliciting
the
consumer.
if
it
is
entitled
to
a
greater
yield,
it
can
afford
to
spend
the
time,
money
and
effort
in
order
to
track
the
consumers
in
the
state
of
minnesota
and
draw
them
off
of
for
instance
in
marquette's
program.
furthermore,
the
omaha
bank
has
a
competitive
advantage
at
the
18%
rate
level
because
the
omaha
bank
in
omaha
is
entitled
to
charge
its
finance
charge
of
one-half
percent
per
month
on
the
previous
balance
of
the
customer's
account.
whereas
in
minnesota,
the
rule
provided
by
our
statute
is
that
must
charge
that
rate
on
the
average
daily
balance
of
the
customer's
account.
now,
while
charging
a
finance
charge
of
say
1%
on
the
average
balance,
the
account
is
distinguished
from
the
previous
balance.
the
yield
is
greater
using
the
previous
balance
method.
so
that's
just
another
example
of
how
omaha
bank
and
its
subsidiary
are
privileged.
secondly,
we
are
not
as
mr.
allyn
has
suggested
urging
that
you
overrule
tiffany.
a
tiffany
can
be
limited
to
its
facts.
a
tiffany
was
a
situation
involving
a
missouri
bank,
it
was
intrastate
transaction.
the
missouri
law
provided
for
a
10%
rate
of
interest
to
general
lenders
in
the
state;
a
state
bank
is
limited
8%.
we
have
missouri
bank
which
charge
at
9%
interest
and
the
debtors
sue.
mr.
john
troyer
i
don't
believe
--
certainly,
the
eighth
circuit
extended
tiffany
beyond
what
i
think
ought
to
happen
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
cannot
apply
or
should
not
apply
tiffany
in
an
interstate
transaction,
that
the
section
85
does
not
or
should
not
--
does
not
permit
that.
the
very
language
of
section
85
does
not
permit
that.
if
you
look
at
the
clauses
and
try
to
construe
them
together,
the
first
clause
which
permits
a
bank
located
in
the
nebraska
for
instance,
to
charge
the
highest
rate
of
interest
to
general
lenders
in
the
state
of
nebraska.
if
you
look
at
that
first
clause
--
mr.
john
troyer
would
you
give
me
that
again
please?
i
didn't
follow.
mr.
john
troyer
marquette's
position
is
that
section
85
is
totally
silent
on
issue
of
what
rates
of
interest
make
--
on
the
rates
of
interest
which
may
be
charged
in
interstate
loan
transactions.
it
is
perfectly
clear
in
intrastate
setting
but
not
in
the
interstate
--
mr.
john
troyer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
troyer
no,
no,
no,
minnesota
couldn't
require
an
iowa
bank
in
iowa
obviously.
mr.
john
troyer
when
that
iowa
comes
in
to
minnesota,
when
it
solicits
minnesota
residents,
when
it
--
mr.
john
troyer
all
it
could
require
under
the
first
--
most
favored
lender
doctrine
in
tiffany
is
that
--
mr.
john
troyer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
troyer
the
iowa
bank,
when
it
comes
in
to
minnesota,
has
the
privileges
of
minnesota
national
banks,
so
that
the
minnesota,
that
passes
a
law
permitting
minnesota
banks
to
charge
12%
or
18%
certainly,
the
iowa
bank
could
take
advantage
of
that.
mr.
john
troyer
by
virtue
of
section
85.
mr.
john
troyer
no,
it
applies
to
intrastate
transaction.
mr.
john
troyer
well,
the
marquette
national
bank
is
given
a
special
standing
under
minnesota
statute
as
sort
of
a
private
attorney
general
to
enforce
the
minnesota
statute.
the
marquette
bank,
in
and
of
itself
has
no
standing
to
sort
of
claim
a
usury
here
against
the
omaha
bank
or
the
omaha
as
subsidiary.
that
cause
of
action
belongs
to
consumers
or
it
belongs
to
the
state
of
minnesota
acting
in
behalf
of
consumers
of
the
state.
mr.
john
troyer
well,
we
would
have
loved
--
marquette
would
have
loved
to
been
able
to
bring
cause
of
action
against
that
omaha
bank
for
usury
but
we
simply
didn't
feel
we
had
standings.
mr.
john
troyer
the
state
of
minnesota,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
it's
intervention
--intervening
complaint
has
a
sort
of
the
cause
of
action
against
the
omaha
subsidiary
for
that
purpose
and
is
asking,
if
the
minnesota
supreme
court
is
reversed
here.
it's
asking
recover
or
for
an
adjustment
in
their
interest
rate,
charged
among
the
consumers.
so,
that's
a
part
of
the
state
of
minnesota's
cause
of
action.
mr.
john
troyer
in
response
to
that
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
marquette
bank
has
been
disadvantaged.
there
has
been
a
drawing
off
of
the
customers
of
the
marquette
national
bank,
and
the
statute
was
passed
both
for
the
benefit
of
state
banks
in
minnesota
and
national
banks
located
in
minnesota,
and
for
minnesota
consumers.
and
we
are
--
we
have
standing
under
that
statute
and
have
sort
of
our
claim
here,
because
we
have
been
injured.
we
are
injured
when
the
nebraska
bank
comes
in
here
and
offers
its
card
free
to
minnesota
residents
in
order
to
take
--
it
can
afford
to
offer
the
card
free
when
you
have
--
when
it's
permitted
to
charge
an
18%
rate.
if
it
had
operated
12%
rate,
they
wouldn't
be
offering
that
card.
mr.
john
troyer
i
assume
not.
mr.
john
troyer
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
troyer
back
to
my
point,
if
you
look
at
the
--
the
seventh
circuit
here
has
taken
the
position
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
it
talks
in
the
first
clause
of
12
u.s.c.
85
that's
on
page
23
of
our
brief,
it
talks
about
to
the
fact
that
the
words
are
“any
loan”
and
that
means
any
loan
made
in
the
state
of
nebraska,
any
loan
made
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
we
don't
believe
that
you
can
read
the
statute
that
way.
given
the
second
clause
of
12
u.s.c.
85,
that
interpretation
won't
wash
the
interpretation
here
that
nebraska
bank
can
charge
you
the
highest
rate
of
interest
provided
in
either
state.
the
clause
has
taken
as
a
whole,
are
clearly
referring
to
any
loans
made
in
the
state
where
the
national
bank
is
located.
you've
got
to
construe
both
clauses
together.
if
the
words
“any
loan”
in
the
first
clause
referred
to
loans
made
across
state
lines,
then
the
second
clause
presumably
would
refer
to
the
rate
of
interest
permitted
state
bank
located
in
the
foreign
state,
rather
than
state
banks
located
in
the
home
state.
it's
clear
that
the
second
clause
refers
to
the
rate
of
interest
permitted
state
banks
located
in
the
home
state
and
the
home
state
only.
the
construction
given
here
by
the
seventh
circuit
by
the
state
of
minnesota
is
section
85,
conflicts
with
the
doctrine
of
the
competitive
equality
which
has
been
ever
since
tiffany,
that
has
been
part
and
parcel
in
section
85.
the
purpose
of
congress
in
adopting
section
85
was
to
maintain
and
secure
the
competitive
equality
between
national
banks
and
state
banks
and
the
interest
rates
they
could
charge.
if
you
look
at
the
senate
debates
in
the
congressional
globe
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
it's
clear
that
there
is
not
any
debate
by
the
senators
as
to
this
point,
as
to
what
interest
rates
could
be
charged
for
a
national
bank
across
the
state
lines.
certainly,
they
would
have
debated
that
point
because
you
had
a
state
bank
lobby
on
one
hand
in
1864
and
you
had
a
national
bank
lobby
on
the
other
hand.
and
they
were
very
concerned,
each
separate
party,
by
protecting
their
interests
and
that
if
there
was
any
thought
of
that
time
in
adopting
section
85
that
the
national
bank
from
nebraska
was
going
to
be
able
to
come
into
the
state
of
minnesota
and
charge
nebraska
rates,
the
senators
will
raise
it.
you
would
have
seen
that
in
the
debates,
you
don't
see
that
in
the
debates.
adoption
of
the
seventh
circuit
--
decision
adoption
of
the
minnesota
position
and
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
position
means
destruction
here
of
the
doctrine
of
competitive
equality
between
state
national
banks
and
interest
rates.
as
mr.
allyn
pointed
out,
there
is
a
very
delegate
balance
between
national
banks
and
states
banks
in
terms
of
the
competition
between
them.
if
you're
going
to
allow
a
nebraska
bank
to
come
in
here,
to
the
state
of
minnesota,
and
by
offering
the
card
free,
draw
off,
and
in
effect
to
ruin
marquette's
bank
card
program,
what's
to
stop
it
from
going
to
some
other
state
and
doing
the
same
thing.
no
local,
national
or
state
bank
will
be
safe
from
the
predatory
practices
then
about
the
state
national
banks
located
in
the
state
permitting
high
interest
rates.
again,
i
emphasize,
that
marquette
in
the
state
of
minnesota
take
the
position
that
section
85
of
national
bank
act
is
simply
silent
on
the
issue
what
interest
rates
may
be
charged
by
a
national
bank
when
it
crosses
state
lines
and
transacts
business
in
the
foreign
state.
mr.
john
troyer
that's
correct,
for
purposes
of
conducting
business
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
we
take
the
position
that
since
section
85
is
silent
that
ordinary
conflicts
or
conflict
of
law
rules
apply
here.
for
instance,
in
the
first
clause
of
section
85,
when
you
read
the
words
--
the
laws,
any
national
bank
association
may
charge
on
a
loan
or
discount
made
interest,
the
rate
allowed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
that
means
the
state's
conflicts
of
law
rules
as
well.
take
for
instance
the
state
lender
in
nebraska
who
chooses
to
come
in
to
the
state
of
minnesota
based
on
nebraska's
conflict
of
laws
rules
that
the
state
bank
in
nebraska
would
presumably
given
a
strong
public
policy
statement
in
the
minnesota
statute
have
to
comply
with
the
minnesota
credit
card
act.
mr.
john
troyer
if
that
consumer
goes
to
omaha,
nebraska,
and
our
act
specifically
provides
for
that
provision,
subdivision
8,
i
believe
it
was.
when
that
minnesota
consumer
goes
to
nebraska,
and
obtains
a
loan
from
nebraska
or
obtains
the
card
from
nebraska
bank,
it
shows
up
what
the
premises
the
omaha
bank,
certainly,
then
in
that
situation.
but
that's
not
what
happened
here
because
omaha
bank
was
in
minnesota,
through
its
operating
subsidiary,
systematically
and
continuously
soliciting
minnesota
residents
for
the
purposes
of
enrolling
them
in
that,
the
nebraska
bank's
program.
mr.
john
troyer
we
don't
disagree
with
that
position,
that
is
really
the
position
of
the
state
of
minnesota,
that
for
intrastate
--
mr.
john
troyer
--
for
intrastate
loan
transactions,
the
national
bank
is
located
in
nebraska.
mr.
john
troyer
well,
let
me
make
it
orally.
mr.
john
troyer
no,
no,
i
can
accept
that
argument
as
an
alternative
ground
for
holding
the
favor
of
marquette
and
state
of
minnesota.
