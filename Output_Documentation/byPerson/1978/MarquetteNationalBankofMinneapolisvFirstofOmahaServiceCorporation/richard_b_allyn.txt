mr.
richard
b.
allyn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
counsel,
i
do
speak
on
behalf
for
the
interest
of
the
state
of
minnesota
in
this
case.
this
is
an
appeal
for
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
the
dispute
is
over
whether
a
nebraska
national
bank
has
to
abide
by
the
minnesota
usury
laws
when
it
charges
interest
to
minnesota
residents
under
bank
credit
card
program
conducted
in
minnesota
or
whether
is
it
claimed
that
it
can
impart
the
nebraska
usury
law
in
to
minnesota
in
order
to
charge
6%
more
interest
than
the
other
banks
are
doing
business
in
minnesota
including
other
national
banks.
now,
bankamericard
and
master
charge
credit
card
programs
have
been
marketed
in
minnesota
if
indeed
throughout
the
country
for
many
years.
it's
a
fair
statement
to
say
that
thousands
of
minnesotans
rely
on
these
cards
daily
to
purchase
goods
and
services
and
need
to
get
cash
advances.
a
few
years
ago,
minnesota
passed
a
specific
statute
to
govern
these
kinds
of
transactions.
it's
known
as
the
open
end
loan
arrangement
law
we
call
it
the
bank
credit
card
act
but
essentially
it
says
this,
that
a
state
or
national
bank
or
savings
bank
can
issue
a
credit
to
a
consumer,
permit
them
to
pay
it
back
in
a
flexible
way,
permit
them
use
the
money
in
a
flexible
way.
and
indeed,
the
cardholder
himself
decides
when
he's
going
to
obtain
the
credit
and
when
he's
going
to
pay
it
off.
in
minnesota,
the
statute
says,
the
annual
interest
that
may
be
charged
is
12%.
in
addition,
there
are
some
compounding
limitations.
finally,
there
is
a
$15.00
fee
permitted
--
up
to
$15.00
permitted
for
the
privilege
in
using
the
card.
it's
important
to
note
that
without
exception
the
national
banks
and
the
state
banks
of
minnesota
which
have
issued
and
used
these
cards
have
abided
by
the
minnesota
law
from
its
inception
in
1976.
await
1975,
the
first
national
bank
of
omaha,
nebraska
came
to
minnesota
registered
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
which
is
managed
by
one
of
its
vice
presidents
with
our
secretary
state
appointed
a
person
suitable
to
see
the
process
in
minnesota
and
embarked
upon
a
systematic
solicitation
of
minnesota
residents
using
the
telephone
and
the
mails.
in
addition,
merchants
and
banks
willing
to
handle
these
transactions
were
enlisted.
now,
the
problem
is
that
the
first
national
bank
of
omaha,
nebraska
wants
to
charge
18%
on
the
unpaid
balance.
in
addition,
they
have
some
compounding
techniques
if
you
call
them
at
which
exceed
those,
which
are
permitted
by
our
state
statute.
the
issue
in
this
case
then
is
whether
or
not
they
can
do
that
or
whether
they
have
to
abide
by
our
statute.
and
let
me
just
say
by
way
of
introduction
that
it
seems
without
dispute
that
a
state's
right
to
protect
its
citizens
from
usury
has
been
a
tradition
in
america
since
it's
founding.
we
have
a
long
minnesota
on
usury
since
territorial
days
and
this
tradition
was
in
the
mind
of
congress
we
argue
in
1864
when
it
passed
the
national
banking
act
which
is
what
you're
examining
here.
and
that
tradition
was
codified
in
this
respect;
a
number
of
people
wanted
to
adopt
the
uniform
national
interest
rate
but
it
was
rejected.
it
was
felt
that
each
state
should
be
entitled
to
regulate
interest
each
state
could
protect
its
own
citizens.
on
the
other
hand,
they
wanted
to
make
clear
that
their
own
creation
the
national
banks
or
new
creation
that
revised
national
banks,
i
should
say,
would
not
be
unfairly
treated
by
the
state
law.
so
they
provided
that
in
charging
interest
the
national
banks
would
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
where
they're
located.
there's
no
question
that
congress
intended
for
the
states
to
continue
to
set
the
interest
rate
and
that
the
national
banks
would
be
bound
by
them.
and
just
one
quick
quote
and
i
won't
try
to
belabor
it
but
as
the
congressman
from
california
said,
“what
is
the
consistency
or
propriety
of
having
two
rates
of
interest
established
by
law
in
the
same
community?”
what
is
the
benefit
of
having
two
systems
of
usury
in
the
same
state?”
of
course
they
rejected
that
notion
of
two
systems.
all
right,
what
is
now
codified
is
section
85
which
is
an
issue
here
simply
says,
a
national
bank
can
charge
for
a
loan
what
they
can
charge
for
loan
is
that
rate
allowed
by
the
laws
in
a
state
where
it's
located.
first
of
omaha
claims
our
main
office
is
in
omaha,
nebraska;
we
can
charge
the
nebraska
rate
and
go
anywhere
in
the
country
and
charge
that
rate
because
we're
located
in
nebraska.
now,
we
urge
that
congress
never
intended
to
let
this
provision
be
use
to
export
interest
rates
into
other
states.
we
believe
that
congress
intended
to
preserve
to
each
state
the
right
to
regulate
interest
rates.
now,
there
is
no
question
that
the
language
on
its
face
raises
the
possibility
they
assert
here.
we
don't
deny
that.
now,
we
urge
you
to
consider
congress'
purpose
and
intent
when
they
adopted
section
85
and
we
have
supplied
in
our
brief
statement
such
as
similar
to
the
one
that
i've
read
which
indicates
what
that
intent
is.
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
at
the
time
that
congress
adopted
section
85,
it
only
contemplated
banks
be
in
one
place.
banks
didn't
travel
the
--
they'd
pass
the
interstate
commerce
the
way
they
do
today.
a
person
even
from
another
state
one
at
a
loan,
they
showed
up
at
the
bank
and
posted
their
security
or
note
and
bundles
of
notes
were
handled
across
the
counter
in
the
way
they
went.
now,
a
couple
of
courts,
the
decisions
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
have
agreed
that
section
85
then
is
silent
when
a
bank
goes
somewhere
else
than
the
state
where
it's
located,
that
as
a
result
when
they
go
elsewhere
are
governed
by
whatever
laws
in
the
force
in
that
state.
i
think
there's
an
alternative
argument
that
is
just
to
sound
and
which
i
would
urge
here
today
as
well
and
that
is
that
located
can
mean
more
than
just
where
the
home
office
is
or
that
building
is.
if
you
look
at
the
intention
of
congress
and
you
apply
it
to
the
transaction
here,
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
question
when
a
bank
comes
in
to
minnesota,
does
a
substantial
solicitation,
profits
by
its
commerce
in
our
state,
maintains
a
corporation
license
to
do
business
in
minnesota
or
a
form
corporation.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
we're
not
sure
what
the
national
bank
would've
done.
it
seems
that
it
may
well
have
and
the
reason
for
that
is
the
subsidiary
was
the
one
according
to
the
stipulated
record
which
made
agreements
with
the
local
banks
which
would
handle
the
paper
coming
from
the
merchants.
and
secondly,
the
subsidiary
was
the
one
that
was
going
to
collect
delinquent
accounts.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
keep
the
interest.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota,
that's
correct
your
honor.
they
felt
because
of
a
prior
interpretation
in
the
eighth
circuit
that
they
were
bound
by
it.
but
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
you
read
our
court's
opinion
and
you'll
find
that's
one
of
the
most
reluctant
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
okay,
and
the
reason
they
weren't
happy
is
because
of
the
anomalous
result
and
that
is
that
one
state
could
go
anywhere
a
bank
from
one
state
could
go
anywhere
in
the
country
and
beat
up
the
competition
there
because
they're
bringing
a
different
interest
rate
with
them.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
okay,
the
problem
comes
up
here
mr.
chief
justice
is
they
have
advertise
their
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
well,
it
would
have
made
a
difference
here
and
here
is
how
it
happened.
they
claim
that
their
card
was
free.
no
other
card
in
minnesota
had
claimed
that.
the
reason
they
could
claim
their
card
was
free
is
that
they
weren't
charging
this
privilege
fee
and
the
reason
they
can
do
that
is
because
they're
charging
a
higher
amount
of
interest.
so,
no
one
else
could
make
this
wonderful
claim
that
their
card
is
free
and
pity
the
consumer
walking
down
the
street.
all
these
banks
said
--
signs
up
said
bankamericard,
many
banks
and
facilities
not
an
exclusive
license.
and
let's
face
it,
one
of
the
intents
behind
usury
laws
and
idea
is
the
public
can't
protect
itself
wholly.
it
doesn't
shop
as
wisely
as
it
might.
so,
we're
saying
the
legislature
is
saying
in
the
exercise
of
our
police
power.
we
got
look
out
for
the
citizens
to
a
limited
extent.
and
that
limited
extent
is
set
in
outside
limit
on
how
much
interest
can
be
charge.
so,
i
agree
that
shopping
around
is
certainly
a
part
and
parcel
of
our
economy
but
some
protections
apparently
have
been
added.
the
important
thing
that
we
want
to
emphasize
here
today
that
we're
speaking
for
the
state
of
minnesota
is
that
we
feel
very
strongly
that
if
section
85
interpreted
in
the
way
that
they
want
it's
going
to
displace
our
own
ability
to
protect
our
citizens
from
usury.
and
i
think
there
are
some
analogous
cases
although
they're
not
based
on
section
85
but
those
cases
the
(inaudible)
cases.
there're
three
of
them
now
out
of
the
circuits.
all
of
them
holding
that
a
mail
or
company
in
chicago
which
ship
things
off
to
say
a
state
like
in
pennsylvania
must
not
charge
more
interest
than
the
law
in
pennsylvania
and
it
is
not
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
and
it's
not
an
interference
to
their
ability
make
a
profit
in
that
state.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
that's
true
your
honor.
i
frankly
think
our
case
is
a
little
stronger.
but
one
of
the
points
i
want
to
make
to
you
today
is
that
they're
looking
for
approval
of
a
radical
departure
from
the
custom
and
the
trade
today.
to
our
knowledge,
there
are
only
two
national
banks.
they
are
going
elsewhere
and
claiming
that
they
can
take
their
higher
rate
with
them
and
at
least
we
did
it
one
or
two
last
points
i
want
to
make
before
giving
way
to
other
counsel.
that
is
there
is
a
request
been
made
in
one
of
the
amicus
that
you
make
a
perspective
ruling
here.
firstly,
the
state
does
not
object
to
that
because
we're
just
seeking
an
injunction.
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
our
evidence
shows
that
first
of
all
there
aren't
that
many
other
banks
that
were
doing
this.
almost
every
state
in
the
country
today
has
a
bank
credit
card
statute
which
sets
an
interest
rate
in
that
state.
secondly,
first
omaha
came
into
minnesota
and
kept
doing
what
they
did
in
the
face
of
our
new
statute
without
ever
challenging,
without
ever
bringing
on
a
declaratory
judgment,
without
ever
even
asking
the
commissioner
of
banking
for
an
opinion.
so,
what
isn't
is
if
they
want
a
notice
if
there
might
be
a
problem
that
they
decide
the
commerce
in
our
state
and
take
a
profit
from
our
state
without
abiding
by
our
law.
one
last
point
then,
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
[laughter
attempt]
your
honor,
i
think
the
justice
opinion
felt
that
because
of
the
procedural
way
the
case
actually
came
up
to
minnesota
courts
with
the
first
national
bank
itself
of
omaha
not
being
there
that
they
felt
that
in
effect
their
decision
was
going
to
effect
that
bank.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
yes,
your
honor.
that
they
shouldn't
have
try
and
implement
a
different
rule
law
then
what
they
felt
was
a
superior
court
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
actually,
no
they
were
--
well,
they
mentioned
tiffany.
i
think
what
they
felt
their
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
i
don't
suggest
you
over
rule
tiffany,
your
honor.
i
suggest
what
they
want
you
to
do
is
expand
tiffany
way
beyond
what
the
supreme
court
in
1974
dissent.
what
they
were
--
i
think
the
minnesota
court
felt
bound
by
--
was
the
fisher
case
in
the
eighth
circuit.
and
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
your
honor,
it
was
in
dicta.
actually,
they
started
right
out
by
saying
section
85
is
clear;
they're
located
in
nebraska
it's
in
nebraska
transaction
there
in
iowa.
but
there's
no
question
they
discussed
tiffany
and
said,
if
the
most
favored
lender
factor
and
they
had
to
be
used
here
because
iowa
had
a
higher
rate
and
all
they
could
charge
the
higher
rate
in
iowa.
and
i
don't
deny
you
that
tiffany
is
very
important
part
in
the
case
and
co-counsel
is
going
to
talk
about
the
most
favored
lender
doctrine.
but
you
don't
have
to
overrule
it
here.
the
most
favored
lender
doctrine
was
meant
to
protect
banks
from
discrimination
against
state
banks
in
their
same
location.
we
don't
have
a
discriminatory
statute
in
minnesota.
all
banks
and
lenders
in
the
bank
credit
card
business,
indeed
any
kind
of
credit
card
business,
charge
the
same
interest
rate
in
minnesota,
it's
12%.
if
it's
a
diners
or
a
local
department
store,
if
it's
an
installment
loan
from
the
bank,
they're
all
12%.
so,
i
--
point
i
want
to
make
to
you
your
honor
is
that
why
some
people
don't
like
tiffany,
we
don't
want
you
to
feel
you
have
to
overturn
to
get
to
where
we
want
to
go
today.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
okay,
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
i
may
address
that
real
quickly.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
33%
for
a
loan
up
to
$300.00,
18%
for
$300.00
to
$600.00,
and
15%
up
to
$1,200.00
which
is
the
outside
limit.
the
important
thing
to
note
here
is
that
the
close
end
transaction,
it's
--
doesn't
permit
any
compounding
and
it
has
other
limitations
that
they
don't
even
begin
to
comply
with
here.
now,
they
used
that
argument
mr.
justice
stewart
to
say
that
they
can
go
and
grab
off
that
interest
rate
there
and
use
it
on
these
credit
card
transactions.
what
it
done
to
all
the
small
loan
act
was
designed
to
make
credit
available
to
people
who
couldn't
frankly
get
credit
card.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
alright.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
under
tiffany,
they
could
charge
a
higher
percent.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
and
we're
not
contesting
that.
we
just
don't
have
that
situation.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
was
the
small
loan
company
act
issue
raised
in
minnesota
court?
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
it
has
been
alluded
to.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
yes,
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
yes.
they
have
at
least
in
briefing
said
if
nothing
else
to
you
we
can
use
the
most
favored
lender
doctrine
here
in
minnesota
by
applying
this
18%
which
we
found
over
here
in
the
small
loan
acts.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
i
don't
believe
the
minnesota
court
decided
that
it
had
to.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
sure
it
didn't.
