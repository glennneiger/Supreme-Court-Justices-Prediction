incidentally,
mr.
bork,
the
section
30,
that
was
in
tiffany
read
almost
exactly
(voice
overlap),
didn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota.
the
first
national
bank
of
omaha,
nebraska
is
a
national
bank
chartered
in
nebraska.
it's
also
enrolled
in
the
bankamericard
plan
and
includes
among
its
customers
under
that
plan
a
number
of
cardholders
who
are
residents
of
the
adjoining
state
of
minnesota.
the
rate
of
interest
permitted
to
be
charged
to
cardholders
under
nebraska
law
is
18%
on
unpaid
balances.
under
minnesota
law,
it's
12%.
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
held
that
this
omaha
and
nebraska
bank
could
charge
resident
cardholders
in
minnesota,
the
18%
rate
and
is
not
limited
to
the
12%
rate
authorized
by
minnesota
law.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
reached
that
conclusion
on
the
ground
that
as
a
national
bank,
the
omaha
bank
is
a
federal
instrumentality
whose
interest
rate
for
its
bankamericard
program
is
governed
by
federal
law,
and
federal
law,
the
national
bank
act,
12
united
states
code
section
85,
authorizes
a
national
bank
to
charge
interests
on
any
loan
at
the
rate
allowed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
where
the
bank
is
and
the
word
of
the
statute
is
located.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
held
that
the
omaha
bank
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute
was
located
in
nebraska,
therefore,
authorize
the
charge
in
nebraska
18%
rate.
we
agree
and
unanimously
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
