justice
byron
r.
white
general
allyn,
why
do
you
think
the
minnesota
court
was
so
deferential
to
the
eighth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
hasn't
been
historically
true
and
i
wondered
why
they
were
persuaded
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
they
feel
that
the
eighth
circuit
felt
and
then
this
court
feel
it
was
bound
by
tiffany
in
a
way
that
tiffany
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
suggest
we
overrule
tiffany,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
fisher
--
what
it
did
in
the
fisher
wasn't
the
fisher
case
didn't
purport
to
follow
tiffany?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
under
tiffany,
what
if
in
the
home
state
of
the
bank?
the
state
has
a
special
--
a
general
rule,
interest
rates
at
18%
and
then
they
set
a
special
rate
for
the
state
banks
12%.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
under
tiffany,
the
national
bank
isn't
bound
by
that,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
18.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
see
that
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
minnesota
court
pass
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
the
eighth
circuit
understood
to
stand
for
something
a
little
more
broad
than
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
act
of
extending
credit
is
in
the
credit
thing,
it's
when
--
if
a
customer
goes
to
a
restaurant
and
uses
it's
credit
card
and
signs
his
slip,
it's
when
the
bank
pays
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
happens
in
omaha,
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
can't
minnesota
say,
if
omaha
bank
wants
to
have
one
of
its
customers
use
his
credit
card
in
minnesota,
that
minnesota
can
control
the
terms
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
does
minnesota
said
that's
different
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
the
agreement
i
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bork,
are
there
some
controller
regulations
under
85
that
would
indicate
some
administrative
construction
of
the
statute
down
through
the
years
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
never
mind
that,
i
can
find
it,
but
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
old?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
that
say
that
the
rate
of
interest
on
an
interstate
loan
is
going
to
be
governed
by
the
state
of
the
bank?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
