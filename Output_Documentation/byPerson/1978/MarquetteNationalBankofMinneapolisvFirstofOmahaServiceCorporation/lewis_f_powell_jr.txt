mr.
bork,
you
arguing
about
the
trillions
of
loans
that
would
be
affected
by
this
case
prompts
me
to
ask
why
the
--
the
banking
industry
apparently
has
taken
so
little
interest
in
this
case?
i
don't
see
a
vast
number
of
amici
brief.
has
the
american
bankers
association
filed
a
brief
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there's
one
--
one
by
the
bank
examiners
but
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
every
major
bank
in
the
united
states
solicits
loans
in
virtually
every
state,
as
well
as
foreign
countries.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
this
case
would
control
the
interest
rates
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course,
that's
right.
