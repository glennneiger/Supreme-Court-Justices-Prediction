justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
regulates,
doesn't
it,
that
one
section
that
you
just
referred
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
then
that
oklahoma
could
prohibit
any
sort
of
commercial
dealing
in
natural
minnows?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
the
police
power
is
always
presumed
to
have
been
properly
exercised
unless
your
state
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
aren't
all
state
laws
presumed
constitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
if
they
want
to
make
him
fish
on
the
oklahoma
side
of
the
lake
they
would
have
no
exception
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they'd
force
him
to
fish.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
helton,
could
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down.
do
you
think
it
would
be
necessary
if
we
were
to
rule
in
your
favor
for
us
to
expressly
overrule
the
case
of
geer
against
connecticut?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
makes
the
oklahoma
statute
narrower
than
the
one
in
here,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
it
make
the
oklahoma
statute
narrower
than
the
one
in
geer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
oklahoma
statute
regulates
less
conduct
than
the
connecticut
statute
did
in
geer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
no
prohibition
against
buying
minnows
in
texas
and
bringing
them
into
oklahoma
and
using
them
as
a
bait,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
could
you
read
that
language
again
mr.
helton.
i
wasn't
sure
from
its
literal
language
that
it
applied
to
someone
who
wasn't
trying
to
sell
them
in
oklahoma?
