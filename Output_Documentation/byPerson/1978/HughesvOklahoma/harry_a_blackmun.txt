a.

mr.
helton,
i
take
it
you
are
relying
solely
on
the
commerce
clause?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
not
relying
on
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
or
anything
else.
just
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
put
your
case
in
the
commerce
clause?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
he
can
destroy
them
if
you
chooses,
burn
them
up?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
say
or
he
can
destroy
them
if
he
chooses
or
burn
them
up
as
long
as
he
does
it
within
the
state
of
oklahoma?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
in
your
opinion
mr.
attorney
general
is
the
justification
for
the
oklahoma
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
do
you
agree
with
counsel
on
the
other
side
that
a
texas
resident
could
go
into
oklahoma
and
buy
minnows
and
burn
them
up
in
front
of
the
commercial
establishment
from
which
he
bought
them?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
there's
no
wildlife
conservation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
that's
a
possibility,
why
they
would
be
characterized
as
a
conservation
measure?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn't
that
interest
served
just
as
much
on
the
texas
side,
of
the
lake
that
straddles
the
state
boundary?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
whatever
the
lake
is?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
wouldn't
it
serve
just
as
much
on
a
lake
ten
miles
inside
texas
as
oklahoma
lake?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
suppose
that
mr.
hughes
here
took
his
minnows
and
sold
them
to
texas
fishermen
on
a
lake
ten
miles
inside
the
texas
boundary,
isn't
that
natural
preservation
purpose
just
as
well
served
there,
or
are
you
restricting
it
entirely
to
oklahoma
nature?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
at
the
same
time
though,
i
could
go
into
oklahoma
and
buy
them
and
bring
them
up.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
there
is
no
statute
that
would
prevent
me
from
doing
so?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
a
great
relief
to
mr.
justice
white.[laughter]
