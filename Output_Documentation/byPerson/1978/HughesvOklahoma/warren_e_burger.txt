hughes
against
oklahoma.
mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
oklahoma
passed
a
statute
that
had
as
its
preamble
or
recital
that
the
supply
of
buffalo
if
they
have
any
or
elk
if
they
have
any
being
limited,
there
could
only
be
one
taken
by
any
person
within
a
certain
limited
season
and
none
could
be
taken
outside
of
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
fine.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
under
this
particular
statute
that
before
us
now
there
is
no
prohibition
against
his
buying,
but
there
is
a
prohibition
against
his
taking
them
out
of
the
state,
is
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
taking
elk
out
of
the
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
states
very
seldom
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
they
put
a
limit
on
how
many
could
be
transported
over
the
state
line?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
haven't
they
done
so
indirectly
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
was
the
purpose,
what
do
you
suggest
was
the
purpose
of
the
three
dozen
limit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anything
in
the
statute
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
suggest
on
its
face
the
three
dozen
limits
implies
or
suggests?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
want
to
hold
down.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
the
same
kind
of
limitation
that
you
put,
that
you
can
only
take
six
trout
or
five
pheasants
or
whatever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
a
conservation
measure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
three
dozen
about
what
you
might
mean
for
a
day
of
fishing,
to
catch
whatever
limits
oklahoma
has.
isn't
there
a
reasonable
possibility
that
there's
a
relationship?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
have
–-
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
really
need
it
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
more
than
three
dozen
in
a
day
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bruce?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
ducks
and
birds
and
a
lot
of
others
too,
don't
they--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
live
off
of
minnows.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
the
next
legislature
counsel
may
take
that
into
account
and
make
a
standard
prohibition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
not
–
we
were
discussing
in
response
to
some
questions
the
fact
there
is
no
limit
on
how
much
you
can
–
what
quantity
of
natural
minnows
can
be
seined
within
the
state,
but
the
only
purpose,
the
rational
purpose
of
seining
within
the
state
would
be
for
a
dealer
to
sell
them
under
that
three
dozen
limit
to
other
fishermen
is
that
not
so?
you
wouldn't
go
about
seining
fish
just
for
the--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
they're
not
edible
in
that
sense,
and
will
be
pretty
expensive
fertilizer,
you
would
only
be
seining
them
to
probably
to
sell
them
three
dozen
at
a
time
to
fishermen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
any
further,
mr.
helton?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
