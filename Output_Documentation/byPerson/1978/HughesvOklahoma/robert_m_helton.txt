mr.
robert
m.
helton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
you
on
appeal
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
in
which
the
appellant
was
convicted
of
violating
the
following
section
of
the
oklahoma
wildlife
code,
specifically
section
4-115
(b)
which
provides
in
pertinent
part
as
follows.
no
person
may
transport
or
ship
minnows
for
sale
outside
the
state,
which
were
seined
or
procured
from
the
waters
of
this
state
except
that;
first;
nothing
contained
herein
shall
prohibit
any
person
from
leaving
the
state
possessing
three
dozen
or
less
minnows.
number
two;
nothing
contained
herein
shall
prohibit
sale
and
shipment
of
minnows
raised
in
a
regularly
licensed
commercial
minnow
hatchery.
it
is
my
position
here
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
the
subject
law
is
repugnant
to
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states.
primarily,
if
it
pleased
the
court,
based
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
of
this
past
term
in
city
of
philadelphia
versus
new
jersey
--
mr.
robert
m.
helton
yes,
your
honor,
no
other.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
yes
sir.
no
other
constitutional
ground
do
i
position
at
all.
that
is
to
say
that
in
as
much
as
this
law
is
100%
on
its
face
blocked
or
curtained
against
interstate
commerce,
that
it
constitutes
therefore
that
discriminatory
nature,
that
disruption
of
the
right
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce
by
the
other
states
and
their
citizens,
particularly
within
the
rule
of
this
court
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
versus
new
jersey,
wherein
mr.
justice
stewart
writing
for
your
court,
said
that;
whenever
the
discrimination
reached
certain
--
when
it
was
that
degree
of
discrimination,
that
it
just
constitutes
a
barrier
of
curtained
interstate
commerce,
it’s
unnecessary,
it's
immaterial
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
state
in
enacting
its
law
properly
exercised
its
police
power.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
alright
sir.
and
sir,
oklahoma
did
that
in
its
conservation
law
in
section
116-a,
the
very
following
section
that
follows
this
section
and
i
think
that's
a
perfectly
valid
and
legitimate
law.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
the
difference
sir
in
this
case
and
the
supposed
case
that
you
gave
me
is
the
party
here
complaining
is
not
the
party
with
the
right
of
the
access.
so
in
this
case,
fred
shellkey
(ph)
is
the
man
who
took
the
minnows
from
the
water
of
the
state.
mr.
hughes
bought
the
minnows
from
mr.
shellkey
under
this
law.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
the
difference
between
the
right
to
take
in
my
judgment
is
the
state
very
likely
in
fact
i
think
without
question,
the
state
has
and
is
properly
exercising
its
police
power
when
it
controls
the
access
to
its
wildlife
as
distinguished
from
controlling
the
right
to,
that
is
prohibiting
the
right
to
transport.
when
at
the
same
time
they
never
prohibited,
they
never
in
any
manner
prohibited
and
attempted
to
control
a
disposition
of
it,
the
commerce
in
it
from
their
license
taker
to
the
next
party.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
in
my
--
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
--
you
are
asking
about
the
right
of
oklahoma
to
limit
that.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
you
are
right.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
i
am
sorry
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
that
would
be
right.
what
i
really,
what
i
think
that
would
help
us
is
to
understand
that
this
overall
conversation
code
of
oklahoma
divides
the
commerce
into
two
steps.
there
is
a
division
in
the
commerce
and
the
first
step
with
the
commerce
is
from
the
water
to
the
licensed,
the
party
authorized
to
take
them
out
of
the
water.
that's
step
number
one,
our
commerce
and
if
the
court
pleas
that's
internal
commerce.
what
texas
people
or
texas
as
a
(inaudible)
would
have
any
interest
in
that,
they
would
have
none
whatever.
but
now
there
is
a
second
step
in
the
commerce
and
that
second
step
is
when
the
authorized
taker
sells
and
disposes
and
oklahoma,
and
at
that
point
because
sir,
because
oklahoma
never
put
any
kind
of
restriction
on
his
right
to
--
the
second
step
of
that
commerce
is
100%
unregulated
by
oklahoma.
oklahoma
has
not
even
enacted
anything
other
than
this
one
section,
that
deals
with
that
second
step
of
commerce.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
it
does
sir,
but
and
i
don't
disagree
with
it.
the
very
object
of
it
though
is
to
prevent
the
exportation,
but
the
very
object
of
it
at
that
point
since
oklahoma
never
by
any
other
law
limited
that
second
step
in
any
manner,
never
controlled
it
in
any
manner.
at
that
point,
it
had
become
inter-state
commerce
and
at
that
point
this
law
then
has
put
the
curtain
that
it
cannot
be.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
i
believe
they
can
sir,
provided,
provided
that
they
make
the
requisite
necessary
finding
that's
the
basis
of
their
exercising
their
police
power.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
i
don't
understand
it.
it's
always
presumed.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
i
am
aware
of
the
utterances
to
that
effect,
but
i
also
i
am
aware
that
wherever
a
law
shows
on
its
face
for
example
and
refutes
that
presumption,
then
the
presumption
is
refused.
now
then,
if
i
be
wrong,
if
i'm
wrong
in
my
position
that
is
if
i'm
wrong
in
my
position
that
the
real
of
city
of
philadelphia
didn't
apply
for
this
case
for
example.
if
i'm
wrong
in
that,
which
i
strongly
believe
i
am
not,
but
if
i'm
wrong
then
the
next
question
that
our
cases
teaches
and
tell
us
is
that
in
the
event
that
a
law
enacted
under
the
police
power
is
going
to
interfere
with
inter-state
commerce.
there
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it's,
the
question
is
then
is
it
doing
it
incidentally.
in
other
words,
though
there
be
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
that
valid
exercise
that
is
there
an
incidental
effect
upon
inter-state
commerce
and
what
is
law
in
that
respect.
well,
one
of
the
--
at
that
point,
it
has
recently
been
determined
by
this
court
that
the
burden
shifts
upon
the
state
to
justify
its
own
use,
i
mean,
its
police
power
use
and
in
its
justification,
it
must
among
things,
show
that
it
could
not
use
its
police
power
in
a
different
manner,
thereby
reducing
the
burdens
upon
inter-state
commerce.
now
then
in
this
case,
if
we
agree
that
the
object
of
this
law,
which
i
find
nothing
in
this
law
that
supports
this
object
either
expressly
or
inferentially,
but
the
oklahoma
high
court
did.
it
said
the
purpose
was
to
prevent
depletion
of
minnows
by
commercial
exportation
or
importation.
oklahoma
did
not,
but
could
have
put
catch
limits
on
its
minnows.
oklahoma
could
have,
but
did
not
make
any
control
over
how
many
minnows
the
dealers
would
have
in
possession
at
one
time.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
they
certainly
could
in
my
opinion,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
no
sir.
for
the
reason
that
-
well
the
real
object
of
the
three
dozen
rules,
we
got
a
lake
down
there
between
texas
and
oklahoma.
the
red
river
runs
through
and
that,
the
three
dozen
rule
in
my
opinion
had
reference
to
that
lake.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
the
part
of
the
lake
--
mr.
robert
m.
helton
yes
sir,
that's
the
name
of
it
your
honor,
it
sure
is.
now
then
--
mr.
robert
m.
helton
to
take
care
of
lake
texoma.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
in
other
words,
i'm
a
texan
and
i
--
mr.
robert
m.
helton
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
no,
sir,
no.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
well,
if
the
--
mr.
robert
m.
helton
there
really
isn't
anything
from
the
law
that
we
could
tell
anything
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
well,
i
feel
this
way
that
--
mr.
robert
m.
helton
i'm
unable
to
read
a
conservation
measure
in
the
three
dozen.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
well,
my
trouble
sir
is
i
fish
too
much
down
there
and
i
can
understand
the
relationship
of
three
dozen
to
us
local
boys
that
fish
now
--
mr.
robert
m.
helton
now
that's
not
in
this
record
and
i
understand
that.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
well
to
me
--
mr.
robert
m.
helton
it
is
impertinent
sir.
i
know
there
is
no
--
three
dozen
couldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
conservation
of
the
minnows
in
oklahoma
or
at
least
that's
my
opinion
it
being
there.
it's
not
supported
by
the
records,
but
that's
–
if
i
maybe
indulged
then
i
will
say
that.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
alright
sir.
on
red
river
sir,
there's
a
lake
that
dammed
up
that
river
and
thus
the
water
that
rivers
in
both
states.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
so
consequently,
i
think
the
legislature
had
in
mind,
if
a
texas
fisherman
came
over
into
oklahoma
to
buy
him
some
minnows
and
does
go
back
on
the
texas
side
of
the
lake
to
fish
without
this
exception,
he
can
be
a
violator
of
this
law.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
oh
that's
terrific.
i
hadn't
thought
about
that;
that
would
be
one
effect
of
it.
you
make
him
fish
for
he
didn't
want
a
fish.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
if
i
listen
to
you
sir,
you're
meaning
to
infer
that
--
if
they
wanted
to
leave
the
three
dozen
exception
acts
--
mr.
robert
m.
helton
the
effect
would
be
the
texan
people
fish
on
the
oklahoma
side.
yes
sir,
i
think
that
would
be
right.
now
then
--
i
naturally,
there
is,
after
we
read
the
residue
of
this
law
that
is
other
than
this
section
4-115
(a)
or
115
(b),
other
than
that
one
law,
there
isn't
a
single
law
in
this
code
that
directs
itself
toward
any
kind
of
general
welfare
protection,
that
is
protection
of
oklahoma
minnows.
it's
totally
barren
of
any
kind
of
the
law,
because
it's
totally
barren
of
any
kind
of
law,
it
automatically,
the
only
thing
you
can
decide
is
that
they
wanted
to
give
the
(inaudible)
an
economic
benefit
that
it's
a
discriminatory
law
that
discriminated
in
favor
of
the
(inaudible)
business.
the
other
thing
about
the
law
that's
to
foster
and
carry
out
and
further
the
general
welfare
of
power
of
the
people
of
oklahoma.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
well,
sir,
i
--
no
sir
i'm
really,
yes
and
no,
if
i
may.
i'll
answer
yes
part
first
and
then
no
part
second.
first
sir,
the
statue
in
the
geer
case
is
basically
and
fundamentally
different
in
this
oklahoma
statute.
the
difference
is
this.
geer
directed
the
prohibition
to
the
very
act
of
taking,
the
word
geer
statue
says
it
is
hereby
prohibited
for
anyone
to
kill
our
wild
life
and
remove
them
from
the
state.
now
i
haven't
quoted
it
to
you
verbatim,
but
i
haven't
deviated
that.
now
this
law,
unlike
geer
isn't
directed
to
the
taker.
the
actual
statutes
aren't
connected
with
the
power
or
the
access
to
take.
that
distinguishes
geer
--
mr.
robert
m.
helton
sir
i
am
sorry.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
narrower?
mr.
robert
m.
helton
well
sir
to
me
the
geer
statute,
the
emphasis
is
on
the
initial
right
to
take.
the
oklahoma
statute
doesn't
focus
its
emphasis
there.
it
focuses
trying
to
enforce
something
that's
not
visible
in
the
law.
now
then
thus,
now
then
i
said
that
yes
and
then
no,
now
then
the
other
part,
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
to
me
this
court
in
the
last
term,
in
the
last
recent
terms,
in
baldwin
versus
montana
and
all
the
cases
you've
stated
there,
limited
to
interstate
commerce
only.
i
think
that
you
have
the
--
i
think
you
have
more
or
less
terminated
now
the
ownership
doctrine.
i
am
not
talking
about
that
you've
terminated
the
power
of
the
states
under
the
police
power.
you
said
the
majority
opinion
relative
to
the
ownership
of
wild
game
in
the
states
was
error.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
your
honor,
i'm
just
--
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
to
counsel
in
section
4-1159(a)
it
provides,
“no
person
may
ship
or
transport
minnows
for
sale
into
this
state
from
an
outside
source
without
having
first
procured
a
license
for
such
from
the
director.
so
if
you
come
to
oklahoma
fishing
from
your
native
state
colorado,
don't
bring
any
minnows.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
and
you
can't
get
one,
now
let's
talk
about
minnow
dealer
license
and
you
can't
get
a
minnow
dealer's
license.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
--
unless
you
are
a
resident
of
oklahoma.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
so
i
am
pointing
out
to
you
that
nobody
can
come
into
oklahoma
to
fish
and
bring
their
minnows
into
oklahoma.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
and
then
of
course
for
an
outsider
that
wanted
to
bring
minnows
into
oklahoma
--
mr.
robert
m.
helton
--
to
feed
the
fish
in
oklahoma,
couldn't
do
it.
mr.
robert
m.
helton
“no
person
may
ship
or
transport
minnows
for
sale”
you
were
right
sir,
yes
sir
i
am
sorry
sir
you
can
do
it
mr.
robert
m.
helton
yes
sir,
okay
you
are
right
mr.
justice
--
mr.
robert
m.
helton
yeah.
thank
you
gentlemen.
