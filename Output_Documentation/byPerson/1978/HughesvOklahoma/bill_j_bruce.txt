mr.
bill
j.
bruce
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
in
order
to
focus
upon
oklahoma's
argument
before
this
court,
i
feel
it
incumbent
upon
me
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
posture
of
the
appellant's
argument
in
the
court's
decision
below.
the
posture
of
the
argument
below
are
the
appellant
was
in
the
form
of
distinguishing
geer
versus
connecticut
from
the
case
of
foster-fountain
packing
company
versus
haydel.
now
as
this
court
is
aware
the
geer
decision
involved
wildlife.
the
statute
there
prohibited
the
transport
of
that
wildlife
across
the
state
line.
in
foster-fountain
packing
company
versus
haydel,
this
court
looked
at
the
underlying
fact
situation
involved
in
that
case
where
the
louisiana
statute
in
the
name
of
conservation
prohibited
the
exportation
of
shrimp
in
which
the
hose
and
heads
had
not
been
removed,
thereby
requiring
their
removal
in
the
home
state
of
louisiana.
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
the
purpose
and
effect
of
that
statute
was
economic
protectionism
for
louisiana
residents.
that
is,
that
statute
favored
louisiana
simply
because
by
the
very
nature
of
the
statute,
the
packing
was
required
to
be
done
in
louisiana
to
the
exclusion
of
other
states.
now
in
the
lower
court
as
i
mentioned,
the
appellant
distinguished
geer
versus
connecticut
from
foster-fountain
packing
company
versus
haydel
and
relied
up
on
the
foster
case
stating
that
it
was
applicable
to
this
case.
the
posture,
however
on
appeal
by
the
appellant
here
is
that
as
i
read
his
brief
that
geer
versus
connecticut
is
no
longer
viable
when
subjected
to
a
commerce
clause
tag.
it's
the
view
of
oklahoma
that
the
concept
in
geer
is
still
viable
today.
the
concept
of
the
state's
interest,
the
state's
interest
in
controlling
its
wildlife
is
as
much
as
alive
today
as
it
was
in
the
time
when
geer
versus
connecticut
was
rendered.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
as
a
conservation
measure,
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
i
would
agree
if
there
is
no
statutory
prohibition.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
no,
sir,
the
statute
does
not
address
that,
that
possibility
notion.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
well,
as
argued
by
the
appellant
below
in
which
the
state
concedes
the
only
viable
commercial
use
for
minnows
is
as
bait
for
other
fish.
it
serves
no
other
purpose
as
far
as
man
is
concerned
in
his
commercial
interest.
of
course
the
state
maintains
that
minnows
also
serve
other
important
functions
of
course
as
a
natural
food
supply
for
game
fish
and
that
the
balance
of
the
–
for
the
maintaining
of
the
balance
of
the
minnow
population
in
the
natural
streams.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
are
you
speaking
of
lake
texoma
mr.
justice
blackmun?
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
yes,
i
think
that
interest
would
serve
texas
as
well
as
oklahoma.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question
sir.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
well,
i
would
concede
that
certainly
that
would
serve
texas
interests,
but
such
wholesale
exploitation
of
minnows,
natural
minnows
in
oklahoma
streams,
if
oklahoma
permitted
the
export,
it
would
require
oklahoma
to
not
only
keep
track
of
what's
happening,
but
to
make
sure
that
additional
minnows
were
added
to
make
up
for
those
which
were
exported.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
well
--
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
well
sir,
we've
never
had
that
type
of
problem
in
oklahoma?[laughter]
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
now
one
another
case
citied
by
the
appellant
the
city
of
philadelphia
versus
new
jersey
of
course
a
recent
case
by
this
court
regarding
a
dispute
between
new
jersey
and
other
states
regarding
the
land
--
for
use
of
landfill
sites.
in
my
brief,
i
distinguish
that
case
as
i
did
other
cases
in
that,
in
that
case
it
involved
a
discrimination
provision,
in
other
words
the
state
of
new
jersey
discriminated
against
out
of
state
citizens
as
opposed
to
citizens
of
its
own
state.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
yes
sir
and
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
or
hopefully
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
that
wildlife
is
a
unique
area
of
law,
and
that
the
state
has
special
interest
in
preserving
the
wildlife.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
a
way
of
conservation
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
i
might
say
that
i
believe
other
states
do
use
the
possession
limit
as
a
means
of
protecting
their
interest
as
an
advice
to
--
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
yes
mr.
justice
white
they
are.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
well,
they
are
licensed
by
the
state,
yes
sir.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
well,
that's
the
focus
of
our
statute
in
issue
here.
there
isn't
an
oklahoma
provision
regarding
an
import
license.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
but
that's
not
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
here.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
the
statute
provides
a
procedure
for
that.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
yes
sir.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
commercial
hatchery
of
minnows,
no
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
no
sir.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
that's
correct.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
the
very
–
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
alright
sir.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
that's
correct.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
as
to
the
number
taken,
no
sir.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
mr.
justice
marshall
in
response
to
your
inquiry,
the
--
it's
true
that
oklahoma
has
no
numerical
limits
on
the
actual
taking
of
minnows
from
its
natural
streams.
there
is
really
no
need
for
that
in
light
of
the
exportation
law
that
is
since
as
appellant
and
appellee
both
agree
that
the
only
commercial
interest
in
minnows
is
as
bait,
that's
the
sole
commercial
interest
of
minnows.
then
those
that
are
seined
from
oklahoma
streams
are
returned
to
oklahoma
streams
in
the
form
of
bait.
so
it
does
--
there
is
really
no
need
for
--
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
well,
if
it
adjoined,
if
the
stream
ran
into
oklahoma,
yes
sir,
conceivably
they
would.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
well,
mr.
justice
stevens
i
won't
debate.
i
am
not
a
fisherman
unlike
mr.
helton
i'm
not
a
--
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
yes,
yes.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
yes.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
yes
sir.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
for
recreational
purposes,
no
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bill
j.
bruce
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
statutory
scheme
is
self
executing
so
to
speak
that
the
natural
and
practical
commercial
object
of
minnows
serves
as
a
natural
limitation.
if
the
oklahoma
bars
the
exportation,
then
they
would
be
returned
to
oklahoma
streams
in
the
form
of
bait.
thank
you.
