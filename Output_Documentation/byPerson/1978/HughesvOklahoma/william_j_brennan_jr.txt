justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
oklahoma.
it
concerns
the
constitutionality
under
the
commerce
clause
of
an
oklahoma
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
transport
or
ship
out
of
oklahoma
for
sale
natural
minnows
seined
or
procured
from
waters
within
the
state.
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
rejected
the
commerce
clause
claim
relying
on
a
case
decided
by
this
court
some
83
years
ago,
geer
versus
connecticut.
geer
held
that
the
citizens
of
a
state
owned
all
wild
animals
within
the
state
and
therefore
that
the
state
on
behalf
of
its
citizens
could
control
the
ownership
of
game
that
had
been
lawfully
reduced
to
possession
by
prohibiting
its
removal
from
the
state
and
that
therefore,
no
question
under
the
commerce
clause
could
arise
because
no
interstate
commerce
was
affected
by
the
prohibition.
but
time
has
revealed
the
error
of
the
rationale
of
geer
and
many
decisions
since
it
was
decided
in
1896
have
eroded
away
its
presidential
statute.
accordingly,
we,
today,
expressly
overrule
geer
v.
connecticut
and
hold
that
state
regulations
of
wild
animals
must
be
tested
by
the
general
rule
applied
to
state
regulations
of
other
natural
resources,
namely,
whether
the
challenged
statute
regulates
evenhandedly
with
only
incidental
effects
on
interstate
commerce,
or
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce
either
on
its
face
or
in
practical
effect,
and
if
the
statute
serves
some
legitimate
local
purpose
whether
alternative
means
could
promote
that
purpose
without
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce.
and
tested
by
that
standard,
we
hold
for
reasons
detailed
in
the
opinion
filed
today
that
the
oklahoma
statute
is
repugnant
to
the
commerce
clause.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
oklahoma
is
therefore
reversed.

justice
rehnquist

the
chief
justice

and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
