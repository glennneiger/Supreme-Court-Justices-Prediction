mr.
helton
i
didn't
understand,
but
i
guess
i'm
just
stupid,
but
what
is
the
reference
to
lake
texoma?
why
would
this
problem
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
don't
you
make
him
fish
on
the
oklahoma
side
of
the
lake
you
know
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bruce
when
they
returned
to
the
streams
as
bait,
their
life
expectancy
isn't
very
long.[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
take
the
position
that
oklahoma
could
have
a
statute
that
said
that
any
fish
caught
in
oklahoma
shall
be
consumed
in
oklahoma,
isn't
that
what
the
statute,
with
respect
to
one
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
could
say
any
fish
caught
here
have
to
be
consumed,
cannot
be
shipped
out
of
state?
that's
the
same
issue,
isn't
it?
