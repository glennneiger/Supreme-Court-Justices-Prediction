justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
second
case,
montana
against
united
states
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
district
of
montana
holding
unconstitutional
montana's
gross
receipts
tax
on
contractors
of
public
but
not
private
construction
projects.
the
questions
presented
is
whether
a
prior
judgment
by
the
montana
supreme
court
sustaining
the
tax
precludes
the
united
states
from
contesting
its
constitutionality
and
if
not,
whether
the
tax
discriminates
against
the
federal
government
in
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
in
1971,
the
contractor
on
a
federal
dam
project
in
montana,
brought
suit
in
state
court
contending
that
the
gross
receipts
tax
unconstitutionally
discriminate
against
the
government
and
companies
with
which
it
dealt.
the
litigation
was
directed
and
financed
by
the
united
states.
and
less
than
a
month
later,
the
government
brought
this
action
in
a
federal
district
court
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
that
tax.
by
stipulation
the
case
was
continued
pending
resolution
on
a
state
court.
and
that
litigation
concluded
in
a
decision
by
the
montana
supreme
court
upholding
the
tax.
the
federal
court
then
heard
the
instant
case
on
the
merits,
and
concluded
that
the
united
states
was
not
bound
by
the
earlier
state
court
judgment
that
the
tax
violated
the
supremacy
clause.
because
we
hold
that
the
united
states
was
collaterally
estopped
from
charging
issues
previously
resolved
against
it
in
the
state
court,
we
reverse
the
federal
court's
decision
without
reaching
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
