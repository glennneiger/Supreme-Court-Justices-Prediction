mr.
victor
h.
kramer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
my
presentation
by
talking
about
the
law
of
this
case
and
the
posture
of
that
law
as
we
stand
here
today.
this
case
has
been
briefed
in
three
courts
and
as
a
result
the
issue
for
decision
by
this
court,
the
legal
issue
for
decision
is
quite
narrow.
we
originally
wanted
the
memoranda
of
discussion
of
the
members
of
the
federal
open
market
committee
at
which
the
domestic
policy
directive
was
formulated.
we
abandoned
that
demand
in
the
district
court
because
we
became
convinced;
particularly,
after
a
close
examination
of
this
court’s
opinion
in
the
series
case
that,
that
was
precisely
the
type
of
document
that
exemption
5
is
designed
to
protect
from
disclosure.
how
any
agency
achieves
its
opinion,
its
order
or
its
policy
statement
is
beyond
discovery
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
but
what
the
order
is,
what
the
opinion
says,
and
what
the
policy
is
disclosable
and
exemption
5
does
not
apply
to
such
type
of
document.
that
does
not
make
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
no,
your
honor.
the
domestic
policy
directive
is
adoptive
at
this
meeting
and
occasionally
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
that
would
not
be
covered
by
subsection
(a)(2)(b)
of
the
act.
in
another
words,
that
is
not
this
case,
it
might
or
might
not
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
it
would
not
be
available
on
our
theory.
it
might
be
available
on
some
other
theory
applying
the
freedom
of
information
act,
but
that
is
not
the
theory
on
which
we
seek
these
documents
and
if
that
was
how
the
domestic
policy
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
i
think
it
might
be,
i
would
have
to
know
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
that’s
right.
it
would
be
available
not
as
a
policy,
it
would
available
as
the
prevailing
rules
as
to
any
piece
of
government.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
if
court
please
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
saying
it
would
not
be
available
under
the
first
subsection
of
the
act,
which
directs
that
all
policy
statements
be
made
available,
but
it
might
be
discoverable,
you
couldn’t
require
the
government
to
publish
it,
but
it
might
be
discoverable
by
a
citizen
asking
for
it
the
next
day
or
the
next
year
that
was
all
i
was
talking
about.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
well,
i
think
that
you
contain
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
lots
of
papers
that
do
not
constitute
final
decisions
that
was
all
i
was
saying,
but
it
is
not
our
case
here
and
our
case
here
depends
solely
upon
the
concession
by
the
government
that
this
is
the
policy
statement
of
the
federal
open
market
committee.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
i
understand
that
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
want
to
keep
my
options
open
too.
i
don’t
know
what
they
are
going
to
do
if
your
honor,
it’s
affirmed
as
we
say.
they
might
turn
to
that,
they
might
not
have
it
in
writing,
and
then
of
course,
the
freedom
of
information
act
wouldn’t
apply
because
it
only
applies
to
records.
turning
now
if
i
may
to
the
legal
posture
of
the
case,
it’s
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
sole
defense
in
this
court
advanced
by
this
defendant
here
today
is
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
permits
an
agency
to
differ
disclosure
of
a
policy
statement
until
that
policy
is
no
longer
in
effect.
if
disclosure
would
seriously
impair
implementation
of
the
policy
and
it
says
moreover
that
the
sole
basis
for
that
disclosure
is
to
be
found
in
exemption
5.
we
respectfully
disagree
with
that
contention
because
we
say
that
this
court
in
the
series
case
said
that
exemption
5
was
designed
to
protect
agency
deliberations,
a
kind
of
specialized
application
if
you
will
of
the
document
of
executive
privilege.
what
we
seek
is
the
statement
in
writing
of
the
policy
itself,
not
how
it
came
to
be
adopted.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
i
dislike
not
answering
questions
categorically
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
the
only
answer
is
that
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
type
of
document.
this
case
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
my
argument
is
confined
to
statements
of
agency
policy.
and
i
am
saying
that
they
are
not
protected
by
exemption
5.
now,
i
recognize
the
difficulty
with
exemption
5
and
i
am
flattered
by
these
questions,
but
i
cannot
settle
the
meaning
of
that
exemption.
today,
i
can
only
tell
you
what
its
application
is
to
government
policy
statements
and
that’s
why
i
am
hesitant
to
answer
your
question.
certainly,
the
statement
you
referred
to,
would
i
have
to
published,
that’s
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
that’s
right.
i
don’t
for
a
minute
suggest
that
your
honor’s
questions
is
not
a
deeply
important
one,
i
merely
say
that
this
case
does
not
deciding
this
case,
does
not
involve
addressing
that
issue.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
it
would
be
difficult.
incredible
i
think
is
too
strong,
but
difficult,
i
would
tell.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
no,
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
irrational
if
your
honor
please,
any
more
than
i
think
the
snail
darter
case
was
irrational,
although,
i
though
it
was
extreme.
i
mean
the
snail
darter
statute,
excuse
me,
not
the
opinion.
[laughter]
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
compared
to
the
billions
here?
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
well,
your
honor
please
we
simply
don’t
know
what
the
effect
would
be.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
if
your
honor
would
like
me
to
address
that
subject,
i’ll
be
happy
to
do
so.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
[laughter]
well,
i
didn’t
mean
addressing
myself
because
i
don’t
know
and
i
don’t
see
how
the
court
can
tell.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
yes
and
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
suppose
it
were?
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
i
can
conceive
of
it
as
an
academic
question,
yes.
in
the
first
place,
i
don’t
think
this
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
be
called
commercial
information.
again
i
want
to
get
back
if
i
can
to
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
no,
then
you
would
have
to
--
if
you
disagree,
move
forth
that
it
would
subject
to
some
recognized
privilege
and
resumption.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
you
would
still
say
that
none
of
these
privileges
applies
to
a
policy
statement.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
yes
that’s
one
argument
but
no
policy
statement
is
exempted
under
exemption
5.
many
government
policy
statements
are
exempt
under
the
act
if
it
would
impair
foreign
relations
international
security
exempt
under
1,
if
it
relates
to
the
internal
pay
policy
of
an
agency
solely,
exempt
under
2.
if
it
is
specifically
exempted
by
statute,
exempt
under
3,
if
it
would
impair
the
enforcement
of
a
criminal
prosecution,
exempt
under
7,
my
point
is
only
the
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
i
am
saying
that
no
statement
of
policy
can
find
any
exemption
under
exemption
5
from
prompt
publication.
that’s
our
position
and
i
believe
it
to
be
sound.
now
the
petitioner
challenges
our
interpretation
of
the
series
opinion.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
no.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
no,
it
is
not.
the
court
of
appeals,
this
whole
matter
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
part
as
i
am
arguing
before
you
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
its
wisdom
chose
to
follow
the
more
conservative
course
outlined
in
this
opinion
and
that
i
rely
very
strongly
if
the
court
please,
i
hope
i
am
correct
in
doing
so
on
your
honor’s
very
carefully
constructed
opinion.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
you
are
welcome
sir.
[applause].
in
the
sears
case,
to
me,
to
take
an
exemption
as
vague
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
pointed
as
exemption
5
and
to
make
the
sense
out
of
it
that
i
think
was
made
in
the
series
case
is
a
doctor
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
well,
the
government
of
course
here
has
not
done
that
in
our
opinion,
it
hasn’t
picked
any
specific
privilege.
furthermore
it
does
not
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
yes
but
which
one
of
7
is
that
the
commercial
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
i
believe
that
clear
that
the
policies
of
a
federal
agency
are
not
to
be
denigrated
to
the
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
they
haven’t
--
yeah
i
also
have
an
even
more
conservative
answer
mr.
justice
white,
they
have
not
been
able
to
point
to
a
single
case
where
any
government
commercial
information
was
privileged
from
production
if
it
amounted
to
a
government
policy.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
maybe
that’s
always
possible
but
the
older
the
public
gets,
more
likely
that
it
would
have
occurred.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
you
are
right
sir.
here
is
one
on
either
the
more
the
court
of
appeals
theory
or
a
mine
that
you
have
to
look
at
some
other
exemption.
when
you
are
seeking
to
exempt
from
prompt
publication,
any
agencies
policy,
not
any
agency’s
decision,
how
much
you
are
going
to
pay
for
real-estate?
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
that’s
a
closer
one.
that
might
well
not
be
protected
under
exemption
5,
now
rather
it
would
be
protected
under
some
other
exemption
i
doubt,
but
i
am
not
sure,
where
do
a
criminal
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
yes,
not
under
exemption.
you
are
right
your
honor,
not
under
exemption
5.
if
you
conclude
as
i
do
hearing
very
briefly
your
honor’s
description
of
the
document,
that
is
a
statement
of
the
government’s
policy.
now
my
brother
in
his
reply
brief
makes
a
distinction
in
attempting
to
distinguish
the
sears
opinion
between
legal
policy
and
economic
policy
and
he
says
that
the
court
can
writing
the
sears
case
was
thinking
of
legal
policy
and
he
points
out
and
to
an
extent
it’s
play
on
the
word
direct
but
he
does
say
with
some,
at
least
partial
accuracy
that
the
federal
over
marked,
i
mean
this
policy
does
not
have
a
direct
impact
on
an
identifiable
individual.
i
find
that
distinction,
one
without
a
difference,
i
can
imagine
no
agency
policy
of
any
us
agency
having
a
greater
impact
on
the
lives
of
the
citizens
of
this
country,
then
none
of
the
federal
open
market
committee,
that
is
the
purpose
of
their
policy
statements
to
affect
the
interest
grades
in
his
country.
the
federal
open
market
committee’s
operations
or
objectives
are
in
the
news
papers
constantly.
this
is
the
matter
that
affects
the
value
of
the
dollar,
the
value
of
the
wage
earner's
money
and
the
value
of
the
investors
accrued
savings,
so
that
i
do
not
think
we
can
dispose
off
the
case
by
saying
economic
policy
is
to
be
distinguished
from
legal
policy
because
legal
policy
refers
to
specified
individuals
whereas
this
is
an
different
type
of
government
activity.
i
submit
that
the
argument
is
being
advanced
here
today
by
the
fed
is
but
a
highly
camouflaged
version
of
the
argument
that
was
made
to
withholded
records
under
the
act
that
preceded
the
federal,
the
fruit
of
information
act.
the
argument
is
that
it
is
contrived
of
the
public
interest
to
release
these
documents
and
then
it
was
the
very
purpose
of
these
amendments
adopted
in
1966.
if
it’s
thereby
a
purpose
to
get
rid
of
the
public
interest
type
of
argument
and
instead
to
have
more
precise
exemptions
to
determine,
what
is
to
be
disclosed
and
what
is
not.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
that’s
another
way
putting
it,
yes
i
accept
that,
yeah
mr.
justice
stewart
and
yes,
mr.
justice
powell?
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
i
am
sorry,
i
did,
yes.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
no,
he
is
not;
he
is
a
member
of
the
bar,
the
district
of
colombia.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
i
have
not
asked
him
because
the
act
doesn’t
require
that
i
ask
him
but
i
assume
that
he
has
no
great
request
from
those
persons
in
the
organization
would
file
amicus
brief
in
this
case.
at
the
time
of
course,
he
was
still
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
under
my
theory
of
what
the
act
provides,
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun
but
all
questions
of
standing
and
that
sort
of
thing
are
out
when
it
comes
to
privilege.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
that’s
right
your
honor,
i
assure
you
that
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
that‘s
absolutely
true
your
honor.
of
course
it
is
not
true
here,
you
can
be
sure
that
the
financial
page
of
every
newspaper
in
the
country
well
carry
the
open
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
by
the
way
i
am
not
sure
and
i
want
to
very
canned
about,
i
am
not
sure
even
the
court
can
understand
these
domestic
policy
directives.
this
one
in
the
record
reeling
at
page
60
and
it’s
very
esoteric
language
but
i
am
told
that
these
words
have
meaning
to
monetarists
and
economists
and
to
traders
in
the
market
and
that
they
will
know
what
they
mean
upon
reading
it
at
once.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
well,
it’s
certainly
not
a
statement
of
policy
within
the
meaning
subsection
a.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
i
believe
so.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
precisely.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
i
don’t
read
subsection
a
to
be
in
its
phrase
statements
of
policy
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
type
of
policy.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
i
would
prefer
you
look
at
the
policy
itself.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
yes,
but
it
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
well,
only
in
the
sense
that
nothing
is
ever
finished
that
any
agency
does
if
the
court
please.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
yes,
i
do.
i
do
when
i
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
i
of
course
would
not
be
foolish
or
i
am
not
to
going
to
arrogant
to
argue
with
the
court
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
opinion,
but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
in
one
sense,
every
government
policy
dictates
a
course
of
action
that’s
what
a
policy
statement
is,
so
that
when
we
look
closely,
i
think
at
the
type
of
record
that
we
are
talking
about
and
if
you
would
turn
to
page
65
and
look
at
one
of
these
policy
directive,
this
is
an
old
one.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
well,
you
couldn’t
understand
the
details
but
you
certainly
could
understand
that
the
board
is
saying
that
this
is
their
policy.
it
is
the
policy
of
the
federal
open
market
committee
while
resisting
inflationary
pressures
and
i
am
reading
at
the
top
of
page
67,
and
working
toward
equilibrium
in
the
country’s
balance
of
payments
to
faster
financial
conditions
conducive
to
the
cushioning
recessionary
tendencies
and
stimulating
economic
recovery.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
well
it’s
a
--
[laughter].
it
might
be
but
it
certainly
the
fed
is
of
course
is
an
open
market
--
in
an
independent
agency
with
great
powers,
not
to
demeanor
from
those
of
the
chief
executive,
but
it
certainly
is
a
statement
of
policy
on
which
future
action
is
based.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
it’s
both,
we
are
claiming
under
both
that
we
could
have
--
if
a
citizen
or
person
ask
for
it,
it
must
be
produced,
but
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
that
is
correct
your
honor,
precisely
so.
we
are
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
absolutely
sir,
absolutely.
and
it
is
our
position
that
any
statement
of
an
agency
policy,
which
dictates
future
contact
by
the
agency
is
cannot
be
exempt
under
5
although
it
may
be
under
1,
2,
3,
or
7.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
wonder
--
perhaps
reiterate
but
emphasize
that
if
this
court
agrees
that
we
must
determine,
whether
a
publication
of
the
policy
promptly
would
impair
agency’s
recommendation
of
that
policy,
then
we
will
then
have
to
have
the
case
remanded
for
trial
below.
you
have
the
experts,
whose
opinions
have
been
cited
on
the
one
side,
and
you
have
the
fed
people
very
sincerely
on
the
other
and
it
is
a
matter
i
should
think
of
great
seriousness
i
suppose
that
we
have
introduced
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
a
trial
in
district
courts
every
time
an
agency
makes
a
claim
that
prompt
publication
of
its
policies
will
impede
implementation
because
the
other
side,
the
plaintiff
will
marshal
his
experts
or
her
experts
in
an
effort
to
prove
that
it
will
not
impede
the
government
policy.
so
we
will
have
introduced
into
the
federal
courts
a
new
type
of
protracted
complex
litigation
in
which
the
agency
is
pitted
--
the
agency’s
experts
are
pitted
against
the
person,
the
newspaper
man,
the
student,
the
corporations’
experts
to
determine
whether
in
fact
prompt
publication
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
intra?
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
that’s
exemption
5.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
yes
your
honor
and
they
have
the
other
side
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
well,
i
don’t
think
so,
they
haven’t
said
--
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
not
quite
your
honor,
i
was
refering
to
the
broad
issues
of
the
types
cited
in
each
sides
brief
in
this
case,
in
which
their
experts
said
what
impede
effective
market
regulation,
our
expert
said,
it
would
make
for
a
better
market
to
publish
promptly,
so
on.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
no,
i
said
that
was
the
law
but
i
didn’t
say
that
our
curiosity
was
ideal.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
yes,
i
would
assume
however
that
ideal
people,
who
file
fla
reasons
of
ideal
curiosity
would
not
be
able
demand
the
type
of
offensive
hearing
that
would
be
required
if
the
government’s
test
and
committee’s
test
in
this
case
is
adopted
because
you
see
there
test
is
not
absolute
that
they
can
differ
willy-nilly
until
a
policy
is
no
long
in
effect.
their
test
is
that
if
it
would
impair
the
implementation
of
the
policy
and
that
they
have
prove
this
is
relevant,
they
have
never
had
a
chance
to
prove
that
because
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that’s
irrelevant,
but
if
it’s
relevant,
i
would
assume
that
we
are
not
out
of
court,
we
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
trial
of
some
kind
on
that
issue,
which
there
will
be
a
battle
of
experts,
i
can
assure
this
court;
theirs
against
ours.
it
just
strikes
me,
when
you
contemplate
that
is
a
solution,
it
seems
to
achieve
result,
which
could
not
have
been
intended
and
certainly
is
not
one
of
the
objectives
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
if
the
court
please
the
act
--
in
some
respects
is
fast
achieving
an
importance
that
is
part
of
the
act
to
get
in
to
some
constitutional
provisions.
one
of
the
cardinal
principles
of
the
act
as
we
read
it
is
that
all
government
policy
statements,
all
agency
policy
statements,
not
specifically
exempted
by
the
act,
are
to
be
promptly
published.
if
the
court
please,
it
seems
to
me
that,
that’s
a
very
good
doctrine,
seems
to
be
that
in
a
democratic
society,
the
notion
that
the
people
governed
have
a
right
to
know
what
the
policies
of
the
agencies’
governing
them
are,
is
that
a
reasonable
doctrine
and
a
good
doctor
and
that’s
all
this
case
seeks.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
oh,
yes
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
am
saying
that
i
read
and
i
believe
with
good
cause.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
absolutely,
that’s
right.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
no,
i
did
not
quiet
your
honor
but
i
said
that
if
it
occurs
to
the
court
as
it
does
pass
to
government
that
the
result
reached
under
the
statute
in
this
case
is
not
wise
that
this
is
the
type
of
statute,
that
it
is
duty
of
the
congress
to
correct
and
of
course
we
think
the
result
reached
below
is
very
wise
but
if
you
different
with
this.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
congress
has
pending
before
it.
let
me
assure
your
honor
a
bill
which
has
gone
nowhere
while
this
case
is
pending,
which
would
exempt
under
exemption
3
this
type
of
record,
i
can
assure
the
court
and
my
brother
on
the
other
side
that
the
congress
will
promptly
consider
that
bail
at
the
conclusion
of
the
proceedings
of
this
case.
mr.
victor
h.
kramer
if
the
judge
is
a
firm.
