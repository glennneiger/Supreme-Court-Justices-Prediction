chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
federal
open
market
committee
v.
merrill.
mr.
geller,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
can
under
your
theory,
legitimately
have
access
to
that
information
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
area
(voice
overlap)
how
many
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
enough
for
your
case,
enough
for
your
case
that
no
body,
no
one
can
predict
with
any
uncertainty
what
would
be
the
consequences
of
disclosure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
there
are
serious
consequences,
is
that
enough
for
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
go
beyond
claims
of
privilege
at
common
law
that
would
be
recognized
in
discovery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
geller.
mr.
kramer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
--
under
which
discussion,
they
follow
the
practice
of
not
under
any
statute,
it’s
just
the
practice
of
saying
this
is
subject
to
reexamination
every
thursday
afternoon
at
our
meeting
and
until
the
final
day
of
announcement,
then
ordered
be
open?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
proposing
that
they
don’t
adopt
it,
but
they
say,
‘here
is
what
we
think
we
are
going
to
do
but
we’ll
meet
every
thursday
at
3’o
clock
and
sort
of
listen
to
the
wind
and
what’s
going
on
in
the
market
and
what’s
going
in
iran
and
zurich
and
montana
and
take
another
look?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
available
on
your
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i
really
meant
was
would
it
be
available
at
all,
necessarily
just
on
your
view
of
the
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though,
it’s
not
a
final
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
ruling
yet.
in
my
terms,
it’s
tentative,
preliminary,
not
final,
subject
to
review.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
answer
would
be
no
decision
has
been
made,
nothing
is
final,
we
are
still
talking
about
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
my
hypothetical
resemblance
it’s
what
the
government
might
do
if
you
prevail
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
irrational?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
a
$150
million
compared
with
a
$1
billion
possibility
of
market
problems?
$150
million
is
a
small
change?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
are
going
to
find
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
we
probably
better
wait
for
freedom
in
for
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
what
permits
some
enterprising
people
to
collect
a
lot
of
government
information,
assemble
it
and
classify
and
select
under
the
act,
there
is
no
prohibition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
can
do
it
for
ideal
curiosity
and
even
if
they
can
understand
the
information
after
they
get
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
addressing
myself
to
the
party
in
the
case,
the
party
need
not
be
able
even
to
understand
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
sounds
like
a
statement
from
the
white
house
press
officer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
your
situation
different
the
one
hypothesized
by
mr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
in
a
law
suit,
there
is
a
reason
for
trying
to
get
information,
presumably
there
is
a
reason.
you
don’t
spin
your
wheels
trying
to
get
your
relevant
information.
here
you
have
already
said,
it
just
ideal
curiosity
is
enough
to
get
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no
but
if
not
that
jurors,
we
will
exempt
present
company,
but
ideal
curiosity
is
enough
to
support
the
claim
by
all
other
claimants.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
to
your
reference
to
this
snail
darter
case,
and
that
you
regard
this
statute
as
on
the
same
level
of
wisdom
as
the
statutes
in
this
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
defending
perhaps
on
what
referred
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
