mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
but
unlike
the
other
cases
this
court
has
considered
involving
the
act,
here
the
government
is
not
contending
that
certain
agency
documents
are
not
disclosable
to
the
public.
well,
we
are
contending
is
that
the
act
grants
the
district
court
discretion
in
an
appropriate
case
to
delay
the
public
release
of
agency
documents
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
just
like
in
civil
discovery,
where
the
immediate
of
those
documents
would
prevent
or
impair
the
effectuation
of
an
important
governmental
policy.
we
also
contend
of
course
that
this
is
an
appropriate
case
for
the
exercise
of
that
discretion.
and
the
particular
documents
and
agency
involved
here
are
the
so
called
domestic
policy
directives.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
the
district
court
took
the
position
that
it
had
no
discretion,
because
the
act
required
immediate
disclosure.
it
viewed
the
act
does
not
allowing
it
to
weigh
the
interests
of
the
government
in
a
temporary
withholding
of
the
documents
against
the
interest
of
the
public
in
gaining
immediate
access
to
those
documents.
it’s
our
position
that
the
act
does
grant
the
district
court
that
discretion,
and
indeed
we
assume
that
if
this
court
adopts
that
submission,
the
appropriate
disposition
would
be
a
remand
to
the
district
court
for
determination
whether
to
exercise
that
discretion
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
we
do,
we
claim
that
it
falls
clearly
within
exemption
5
and
we
construe
exemption
5
to
a
court
at
district
court
discretion
as
i
have
said
in
an
appropriate
case
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
release
otherwise
disclosable
documents
where
the
government
is
made
a
showing
of
harm
from
the
immediate
release.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that’s
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
the
only
exemption
we’re
relying
on
this
court
is
exemption
5.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
believe
it
comes
from
the
language
would
not
be
available
to
a
party
in
litigation
with
the
agency,
which
we
think
what
congress
intended
was
to
mirror
the
practice
under
civil
discovery.
i
think
this
court
is
held
that
on
several
occasions.
now
i
hope
to
get
to
that
a
little
later
in
the
argument.
and
of
course,
since
civil
discovery
the
court
would
get
engage
frequently
in
a
balancing
process
when
it’s
not
dealing
with
documents
that
are
subject
to
an
absolute
privilege
or
documents
not
subject
to
any
privilege
whatsoever,
there
is
a
whole
middle
ground
in
which
you
has
to
weigh
the
competing
interests.
we
claim
that
the
same
analysis
should
apply
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
stay
order
is
still
in
effect,
that’s
correct.
now
before
turning
to
the
specific
foia
exemption
that
we
claim
is
applicable
in
this
case,
which
is
exemption
5,
i’d
like
begin
by
briefly
explaining
the
importance
of
the
open
market
committees
policy
functions,
how
the
domestic
policy
directives
relate
to
those
functions
and
why
the
premature
release
of
these
sensitive
documents
would
severely
frustrate
implementation
of
the
committee’s
policies.
federal
reserve
system
is
of
course
the
nation’s
central
bank,
and
it
helps
to
achieve
the
country’s
economic
goals
through
its
influence
on
monitory
policy
that
is
the
availability
and
cost
of
bank
reserves,
bank
credit
and
money.
system
essentially
has
three
main
goals
and
three
main
tools
with
which
to
accomplish
these
goals.
first
is
the
setting
of
the
discount
rate,
which
is
the
rate
that
charge
member
banks
on
borrowing
from
the
regional
federal
reserve
bank.
the
second
tool
is
the
board’s
power
to
change
reserve
requirements
that
is
the
percentage
of
reserves
that
member
banks
must
hold
in
back
of
deposits.
the
finally
monitory
tool
of
the
system
and
the
one
that
concern
us
here
today
is
the
power
to
engage
and
so
called
open
market
operations,
that
is
the
purchase
or
sale
of
large
amounts
of
securities,
principally
united
states
government
securities
in
the
open
market.
simply
stated,
when
the
federal
reserve
system
buy
securities,
it
increases
the
total
volume
of
bank
reserves,
because
the
fed’s
payment
for
the
securities
is
ordinarily
deposited
in
the
seller’s
bank
account
and
it’s
credited
to
that
bank’s
reserve
account
in
its
regional
reserve
bank.
conversely,
when
the
system
sells
securities,
the
sales
price
typically
is
deducted
from
the
reserve
account
of
the
buyer’s
bank,
and
this
decreases
the
volume
of
reserves
held
by
that
bank.
now
these
changes
in
the
volume
of
the
bank
reserves
obviously
influence
the
ability
of
these
banks
to
make
loans
and
investments,
which
in
turn
has
a
substantial
effect
on
the
availability
of
money
and
the
level
of
interest
rates.
the
open
market
operations
tool
is
by
far
the
federal
reserve
system’s
most
important
monitory
policy
instrument.
open
market
operations
are
extremely
flexible
unlike
the
other
tools
that
i’ve
mentioned
and
they
need
to
be
used
to
the
extent
and
only
to
the
extent
necessary
to
accomplish
the
system
short
or
long-term
monitory
policy
goals.
as
a
result,
while
the
discount
rate
and
reserve
appointments
are
changed
only
occasionally,
the
fed
enters
the
market
on
virtually
every
business
today
and
either
buys
or
sells
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
securities
depending
upon
what
monitory
goal
it’s
trying
to
accomplish.
now
the
organ
of
the
federal
reserve
system
that’s
responsible
for
directing
these
open
market
operations
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
federal
open
market
committee.
committee
is
composed
of
12
members,
the
7
governors
of
the
federal
reserve
board
and
5
representatives
of
the
regional
reserve
banks.
committee
meets
approximately
once
a
month.
its
meetings
begin
with
a
run
down
of
general
economic
developments
and
a
consideration
of
what
economic
developments
might
arise
in
the
immediate
future.
at
the
end
of
the
meeting,
the
system
decides
what
its
plans
for
the
open
market
operations
in
the
upcoming
month
should
be.
these
plans
are
embodied
in
the
domestic
policy
directive,
the
subject
of
this
litigation,
which
is
adopted
by
the
open
market
committee
at
the
conclusion
of
its
monthly
meeting.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
during
the
one
month
period
that
the
domestic
policy
directive
is
in
effect,
only
employees
of
the
federal
reserve
system
with
the
need
of
access
to
that
directive
have
access
to
that
directive,
which
would
be
the
account
manager
who
actually
does
the
buying
and
selling
of
the
open
market
–
of
securities
in
the
open
market.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
say
it’s
just
a
handful
of
people
and
generally
high
officials
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
it’s
a
very
small
number
of
people
that
have
actual
access
to
domestic
policy
directive
during
the
one
month
of
its
effectiveness.
now
the
directive
takes
the
form
of
instructions
to
the
system’s
account
manager
in
new
york.
he
is
an
official
of
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
new
york
and
he
does
the
actual
buying
and
selling
of
the
securities
in
the
open
market.
these
instructions
state
what
the
federal
open
market
committee’s
general
monitory
policy
goals
for
the
upcoming
month
are
and
what’s
more
important;
the
directive
also
specifically
notes
what
the
committee’s
objectives
are
for
the
rate
of
growth
of
the
nation’s
money
supply
and
what
the
permissible
fluctuation
of
the
so
called
federal
funds
rate
in
the
upcoming
months
is
according
to
the
committee.
the
federal
funds
rate
is
the
interest
rate
that
member
banks
charge
each
other
for
overnight
loans
and
it’s
an
extremely
sensitive
of
an
accurate
parameter
of
tightness
or
ease
in
the
economy
in
regard
to
the
availability
of
the
money.
the
account
manager
begins
to
implement
the
directive
immediately
upon
its
adoption.
the
committee
has
always
kept
these
domestic
policy
directives
confidential
during
the
one
month
period
of
their
effectiveness.
the
current
practice
is
to
delay
disclosure
of
the
directive
until
a
few
days
following
the
next
month’s
committee
meeting.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don’t
think
so,
they
can
make
--
knowledgeable
market
observers
can
make
educated
guesses
based
upon
the
account
manager’s
buying
or
selling
of
securities
in
the
open
market
on
a
daily
basis,
but
there
is
a
certain
level
of
uncertainty
that
attaches
to
their
observations.
this
uncertainty
that
wouldn’t
exist
if
the
directive
was
made
public,
and
that
uncertainty
is
very
important
because
it
dampens
the
economic
activity
and
it
prevents
these
market
observers
from
entering
the
market
in
a
major
way.
but
more
important,
i
don’t
think
they’re
just
looking
at
the
account
manager’s
daily
buying
or
selling
would
give
you
an
accurate
picture
of
what
the
directive
is
likely
to
be,
because
most
of
account
manager’s
daily
buying
or
selling
may
not
pursuant
to
the
directive.
in
other
words,
it
may
not
be
for
the
purpose
of
accomplishing
the
goals
set
forth
in
the
directive;
it
may
be
simply
a
response
to
something
that’s
happened
that
day
in
the
market.
let
me
give
an
example.
let’s
assume
that
for
a
number
of
reasons
there
is
a
temporary
glut
of
money
in
the
market
and
may
be
because
of
the
changes
in
treasury
balances
at
the
federal
reserve
banks
or
because
of
the
float.
there
is
more
money
in
the
market
than
the
fed
expected.
now
when
that
happens,
interest
rates
might
be
expected
to
drop,
because
more
money
is
available.
the
account
manager
seeing
these
developments
might
well
decide
to
sell
securities;
in
other
words,
to
take
money
out
of
the
market.
now,
this
would
not
be
for
the
purpose
of
raising
interest
rates.
it
would
be
merely
to
keep
interest
rates
constant
in
a
situation
in
which
they
might
otherwise
drop,
so
that
if
someone
merely
looked
at
what
the
account
manager
did
in
the
market
that
day
which
is
to
sell
large
amounts
of
securities;
he
might
get
the
impression
that
the
directive
is
telling
the
account
manager
to
attempt
to
raise
interest
rates
whereas
that
wouldn’t
be
an
accurate
picture,
the
account
manger
is
merely
attempting
to
meet
developments
that
have
occurred
in
the
market.
now
as
i
was
saying,
the
directive
is
kept
secret
until
a
few
days
following
the
next
month’s
meeting.
at
that
point,
the
directive
for
the
month
just
ended
is
made
available
to
the
public
and
it’s
published
in
the
federal
register.
that’s
for
example;
the
domestic
policy
directive
adopted
at
the
committee’s
meeting
on
october
17th
1978,
was
released
to
the
press
on
november
24th
1978,
and
was
sent
to
the
federal
register
on
november
29th
1978.
primary
reason
for
this
delay
in
publication
has
always
been
the
committee’s
concern
that
advance
public
notice
of
its
open
market
policy
decisions
would
create
excessive
reactions
or
other
disturbances
in
the
securities
market
that
would
interfere
with
the
committee’s
ability
to
implement
its
open
market
decisions.
there
would
be
a
so
called
announcement
effect
as
market
participants
attempted
to
realize
financial
gains
in
anticipation
of
the
committee’s
purchases
or
sales
of
securities
in
the
upcoming
month.
now
this
is
spelled
out
a
greater
length
in
our
brief
and
in
the
affidavits
made
to
the
district
court,
but
let
me
give
it
quick
just
one
example.
the
federal
open
market
committee
each
month
buys
or
sells
literally
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
government
securities.
let’s
assume
that
it
was
known
that
in
the
month
to
follow,
the
committee
intended
to
attempt
to
raise
the
federal
funds
rate,
which
as
i
said
is
the
interest
rate
at
which
banks
lend
money
to
each
other
on
an
overnight
basis.
market
investors
could
reasonably
assume
if
they
had
access
to
this
directive,
that
to
raise
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
committee
would
seek
to
decrease
the
available
reserves,
which
would
mean
that
the
fed
would
be
engaging
in
the
sale
of
large
amounts
of
securities.
on
with
this
knowledge,
it’s
likely
that
many
investors
would
react
immediately
by
also
selling
government
securities.
and
this
would
tend
to
depress
securities’
prices
and
to
inflate
interest
rates
unnaturally.
so
i
have
explained
in
our
brief
these
sudden
movements
in
securities’
prices
and
interest
rates
might
be
larger
than
the
committee
contemplated,
and
might
even
be
beyond
the
ability
of
the
committee
to
control
on
occasion,
but
the
very
least,
these
market
reactions
would
make
it
immeasurably
harder
for
the
committee
to
accomplish
gradually
what
it
set
out
to
do
that
month.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it’s
--
well,
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
excuse
me.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
respondents
have
never
rebutted
that
showing.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
excuse
me,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
milton
friedman’s,
the
statements
that
respondents
have
quoted
from
time
to
time
from
milton
friedman
really
relates
to
the
committee’s
claim
that
the
immediate
disclosure
of
these
domestic
policy
directives
would
allow
market
speculators
to
make
immense
profits
on
just
profits.
now
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
that,
but
there
is
i
think
not
a
great
amount
of
dispute
that
the
immediate
release
of
these
domestic
policy
directives
might
well
hinder
the
committee’s
ability
to
carry
out
its
monitory
policy
goals
which
is
of
course
a
separate
point.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it
may
not.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
that’s
not
as
easily
done
as
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
i
think
justice
stewart
that
your
example
is
an
excellent
reason
of
why
this
type
of
information
falls
within
exemption
5.
exemption
5
as
this
court
said
in
sears
was
meant
to
protect
the
ability
of
federal
agencies
to
make
decisions,
and
that
ability
may
be
hindered
not
only
by
the
release
of
pre-decisional
materials,
but
if
someone
want
to
get
to
in
a
minute,
it
can
be
hindered
by
the
premature
release
of
final
decisions
themselves.
i
think
as
you
correctly
assess
if
the
committee
knew
that
these
directives
are
going
to
be
made
public
prematurely
in
their
view.
they
would
take
a
lot
of
other
measures
that
might
well
skew
their
decision
making
process.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
there
is
a
limit
to
have
different
the
directive
can
be
and
still
accomplish
the
goals,
which
the
directive
now
accomplished.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it
wouldn’t
work
quite
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
[laughter].
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well
that’s
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
is
uncertainly
one
major
part
of
our
argument.
it’s
not
the
end
of
our
argument,
but
i
think
it’s
certainly
the
main
–
the
beginning
of
our
argument
that
they
would
--
there
is
likely
to
be
some
deleterious
consequences
to
the
policy
decisions
of
the
federal
open
market
committee
if
there
was
a
premature
disclosure.
i
should
add
at
this
point
that
the
regulations
of
the
committee
12
cfr
271.5
that
allow
for
this
delayed
access
to
the
domestic
policy
directives.
we’re
not
promulgated
in
response
to
the
freedom
of
nation
act.
we’re
promulgated
in
response
to
the
suit,
they
date
back
--
we
will
be
able
to
face
them
back
in
publish
form
to
1946.
i
am
sure
they
date
back
even
ten
years
earlier
to
when
the
committee
was
formed.
there’s
been
a
consistency
of
view
among
the
many
hundreds
of
members
of
the
committee
and
at
the
federal
reserve
avoid,
that
secrecy
is
an
essential
element
of
the
federal
open
market
committee’s
ability
to
carry
out
of
its
statutory
goals.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
there
may
well
be
some
confusion
here.
there
is
more
disagreement
that
i
think
about
the
so-called
memoranda
of
discussion,
which
were
really
minutes
of
the
meeting,
of
the
each
federal
open
market
committee
meeting
and
which
the
federal
open
market
committee
was
releasing
on
a
five
year
delay.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that’s
true’
there
are
certain
economists
who
have
taken
that
view.
basically
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
is
governor
mizell.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
alright.
of
course
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
would
be
harm
to
the
federal
open
committee.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that’s
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
that
if
the
argument
that
there
would
be
harm
here
was
totally
fanciful,
it
might
be
a
different
situation,
but
let
me
get
to
this
lawsuit,
which
began
in
may
19.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument
although
perhaps
the
need
for
secrecy.
no
one
is
suggesting
that
it
has
to
be
announced
the
minute
it’s
adopted.
there
has
some
way
of
a
publication
time
and
if
the
time
between
meetings
was
sufficiently
small,
then
perhaps
the
current
directive
would
never
have
to
be
published
in
the
federal
register
meeting
(inaudible)
upon
adoption.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i’m
sure
it
would.
the
issue
in
this
case
then
is
whether
the
freedom
of
information
act
invariably
requires
a
government
agency
to
divulge
its
policy
decision
as
soon
as
they’ve
been
adopted,
even
in
instances
where
immediate
disclosure
would
prevent
those
decisions
from
ever
being
successfully
carried
out.
it’s
the
government’s
position
that
the
act
does
not
require
that
harsh
result
and
that
a
district
court
has
discretion
under
exemption
5
to
delay
the
release
of
agency
documents
in
such
a
situation
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
even
though
the
documents
may
embody
a
final
policy
decision
that
might
at
some
point
have
to
be
disclosed.
the
courts
below
rejected
this
contention,
primarily
because
they
viewed
exemption
5
as
directed
only
to
pre-decisional
agency
memoranda.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
view
the
domestic
policy
directive
not
as
pre-decisional,
but
as
the
committee’s
final
policy
decision.
but
while
it’s
certainly
true
that
the
prime
motivation
for
the
exemption
was
to
prevent
public
access
to
internal,
non-final
communications,
the
disclosure
of
which
would
injure
an
agency’s
decision
making
process.
we
believe
it’s
equally
true
that,
that
was
not
the
exemption’s
only
purpose.
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
foia,
a
number
of
federal
agencies
complaint
to
congress
that
their
policy
decisions
could
be
adversely
affected,
not
only
by
the
release
of
pre-decisional
materials,
but
also
by
the
premature
release
of
the
final
agency
decisions
themselves.
for
instance,
one
example
that
was
given
by
the
defense
department
and
the
general
services
administration
is
that
those
agencies
on
occasion
issue
instructions
to
their
employees
on
how
much
for
example,
to
pay,
what
the
maximum
to
pay
would
be
for
the
materials
or
real
estate
or
things
like
that.
the
agencies
were
afraid
that
if
they
had
to
release
those
decisions
after
they
were
made,
but
before
they
would
carry
out;
that
is
before
the
sales,
the
purchases
were
consummated,
but
their
plans
would
be
severely
frustrated,
and
it’s
not
hard
to
imagine
why.
it’s
also
of
more
than
passing
interest
here
today
that
congress
at
that
time
was
also
informed
of
the
serious
problems
that
were
likely
to
occur
if
the
federal
open
market
committee’s
policy
decisions
concerning
purchase
or
sales
of
securities
in
the
open
market
had
to
be
prematurely
disclosed.
now
the
house
and
senate
committee
reports
on
the
foia
state
that
exemption
5
was
drafted
to
meet
those
concerns.
the
reports
indicate
that
premature
disclosure
of
final
agency
plans
and
not
just
the
disclosure
of
internal
agency
materials
generated
before
an
agency’s
plans
were
finalized.
we
meant
to
be
covered
by
the
exemption.
this
congressional
intent
is
also
clearly
reflected
we
think
in
the
language
of
the
exemption
itself.
exemption
5
has
finally
drafted,
permits
the
non-disclosure
of
quote,
inter-agency
or
intra-agency
memorandums
or
letters,
which
would
not
be
available
to
a
party
in
litigation
with
the
agency.
congress
had
been
concerned
only
with
preventing
public
access
to
pre-decisional
memoranda.
this
obviously
would
have
been
a
rather
peculiar
way
of
achieving
that
result.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it’s
a
rather
sensible
way
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
congress
couldn’t
anticipate
every
situation
that
might
arise
in
which
a
plaintiff
under
the
foia
might
seek
access
to
some
internal
governmental
memorandum.
but
congress
did
as
this
court
said
in
epa
against
mink,
legislate
against
the
backdrop
of
the
enormous
case
law
under
civil
discovery
procedures
and
therefore
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
we
think
that
congress
had
said
as
much.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
this
court
said
in
epa
against
mink
and
in
subsequent
cases,
that
congress
wanted
to
adopt
that
exemption
5,
legislate
against
the
backdrop
of
civil
discovery
law.
it
meant
to
allow
the
government
to
take
advantage
of
any
recognized
privilege
available
and
derive
the
case
law
or
statute
and
utilize
in
civil
discovery.
and
that
district
court
should
and
let
me
quote
what
the
court
said
in
epa
against
mink,
"the
exemption
wrote
the
quote
contemplates
that
the
publics’
access
to
internal
memoranda
will
be
governed
by
the
same
flexible
common
sense
approach
that
is
long
governed
private
parties
discovery
of
documents
involved
in
litigation
with
government
agencies."
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yeah.
i
think
that
with
congress,
there
are
three
types
of
documents.
there
are
documents
that
would
always
be
discoverable
in
litigation
with
the
government;
they
are
not
to
subject
to
any
privilege
whatsoever.
there
are
other
types
of
documents
that
you
could
never
discover
in
litigation
against
the
document
because
there
is
an
absolute
privilege
that
attaches
to
them.
now,
there
is
a
large
body
of
materials
that
fall
somewhere
in
between,
that
may
or
may
not
be
discoverable
in
litigation
against
the
government
depending
upon
the
relative
needs
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant,
if
the
defendant
is
government
agency.
now,
we
think
that
what
congress
intended
and
we
think
there
is
much
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
this
court’s
opinions
construing
exemption
5,
which
supports
this.
what
congress
intended
that
the
district
court
would
engage
in
the
same
sort
of
balancing
process
when
confronted
with
an
foia
request
for
that
type
of
material?
what
he
would
balance
is
the
government’s
need,
the
government’s
need
for
secrecy
and
i
should
emphasize
here
that
the
government
is
not
contending
that
these
documents
need
never
be
disclosed.
we
are
only
suggesting
that
because
of
important
government
interest,
they
needn’t
be
disclosed
immediately,
but
rather
should
only
be
disclosed
four
weeks
after
they
are
adopted.
what
would
be
weighed
against
the
interest
that
the
government
puts
forward
in
support
of
limited
non-disclosure
would
be
the
public
interest,
not
the
interest
of
the
individual
foia
litigant
in
gaining
access
to
these
particular
documents.
it’s
clear
that
under
the
foia,
you
are
not
allowed
to
inquire
into
the
interest
of
the
particular
plaintiff
who
has
made
the
foia
request.
but
i
think
it’s
clear
that
you
have
to
inquire
in
order
to
engage
in
this
balancing
process
into
what
the
public
interest
is.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that’s
what
the
foia
contemplates
under
exemption
5
when
dealing
with
a
document,
which
is
not
subject
to
an
absolute
privilege
or
not
totally
unprivileged
when
it
falls
in
this
middle
ground.
i
think
the
court
said
in
bannercraft
that
the
focus
of
the
foia
is
surely
on
disclosure,
but
it’s
not
disclosure
for
the
benefit
of
the
particular
plaintiff
who
has
made
the
foia
request;
it’s
a
disclosure
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
if
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
i
think
--
well,
you
have
to
--
just
as
in
civil
litigation,
you
needn’t
pick
only
one
discovery
provision
and
rely
totally
and
that
if
it’s
any
–
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
are
not,
but
there
are
other
provisions
of
section
26
like
section
26(c)(2)
for
example.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
suggest
section
26(c)(2)
grants
a
district
court
discretion
in
civil
engage.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
heart
of
our
argument
is
that
the
district
court
is
under
the
foia,
when
a
claim
under
exemption
5
is
raised,
just
like
in
civil
discovery,
the
district
court
must
assess
the
relative
benefits
to
the
public
from
immediate
disclosure
and
we’re
not
talking
here
again
about
total
non-disclosure,
just
a
delay,
a
short
delay
in
disclosure
against
the
government’s
interest
in
limited
temporary
non-disclosure.
now,
if
that
arose
in
the
context
of
a
civil
litigation
in
a
suit
by
mr.
merrill
against
the
federal
open
market
committee
and
civil
litigation
not
filed
in
foia,
the
court
might
well
decide
under
rule
26(c)(2),
which
allows
a
district
court
to
delay
disclosures
for
short
periods
of
time,
not
to
order
the
immediate
release
of
the
domestic
policy
directed
because
of
the
serious
government
harms
that
wouldn’t
suit.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
temporary
secrecy.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
may
not
fall
within
(c)(7).
we
are
not
here
to
litigate
the
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
court
of
appeal
suggests
that,
that’s
not
available
to
the
government.
we
are
suggesting
that,
that’s
correct.
all
we’re
suggesting
here
is
that
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
have
put
forward
a
number
of
privileges
that
would
be
available
to
the
government
in
civil
discovery.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
including
that
one,
and
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
district
court
should
have
viewed
this
case,
as
if
it
arose
in
a
context
of
a
civil
litigation
in
which
the
plaintiff
sort
discovery
of
materials.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
if
there
is
an
absolute
privilege
available
to
the
government,
there
is
no
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
language
of
section
(c)(7)
suggests
that
it
--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
then
we
have
to
look
at
the
preface
to
section
26
(c),
which
suggests
that
all
of
the
1-8
or
whatever
it
is
in
section
26
(c)
privileges
may
or
may
not
be
applied
by
the
court
based
on
the
balancing
of
a
number
of
different
considerations,
not
enumerated
in
this
specific
subject.
