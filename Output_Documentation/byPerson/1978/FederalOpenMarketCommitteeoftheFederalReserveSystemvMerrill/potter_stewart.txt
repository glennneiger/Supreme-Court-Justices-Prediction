mr.
geller,
why
we
have
to
interrupt
it,
there
is
a
stay
order
still
in
effect.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
geller,
do
you
think
that
knowledgeable
observers
of
the
market
reactions
will
know
what‘s
going
on
after
a
few
days
however
when
the
fed
gets
into
the
market?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
geller,
of
course
that’s
the
view
of
the
agency,
but
it’s
not
a
universally
help
you,
is
it?

for
example,
milton
friedman
would
disagree.
justice

stewart
milton
friedman
would
disagree,
i
guess?
justice
potter
stewart
milton
friedman
would
disagree
with
this.
justice

milton
friedman
would

i
suppose
these
are
sophisticated
people
dealing
with
the
economic
forces.
i
suppose
if
it
were
given,
if
we
are
promised
that
these
policy
directives
would
be
disclosed,
then
the
policy
directive
might
be
a
little
different
in
order
to
achieve
the
result
that
was
desired.
justice
potter
stewart
knowing
that
the
public
would
know
about
this
and
that
they
would
augment
the
effect
and
therefore
the
policy
directives
would
discount
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
listen,
this
is
all
difficult
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
but
i
am
assuming
we
are
dealing
with
experts.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
directive
would
be
published
in
--
it
would
be
decided
upon
and
then
it
would
become
a
directive
in
the
light
of
the
fact,
it
would
be
public
knowledge
and
therefore
the
directive
would
be
different
in
substance.

instead
of
this
committee
buying
$x
billions,
they’d
buy
one
half
of
excess,
so
we
will
assume
that
public
and
the
speculators
will
buy
the
other
half.
justice
potter

nearly,
not
that
simple.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it’s
also
true
that
some
alumni
will
disagree.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
am
confining
--
just
announcement
of
the
specific
policy
would
be
followed
during
the
ensuing
30
days.
is
it
not
correct
that
there
is
expert
opinion
that
--
although
there
would
be
consequences
from
immediate
disclosure,
those
consequences
would
be
beneficial;
there
is
a
respectable
body
of
opinion
that
way,
and
that
may
be
it
doesn’t
control
it.

of
the

last
one
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
this
is
something
the
chief
justice
suggested.
do
your
argument
would
be
the
same
and
even
if
you’d
acknowledge
that
there
could
be
a
legitimate
difference
of
opinion
on
this
point.
justice
potter
stewart
therefor
i
don’t
understand
why
you
are
spending
so
much
time
trying
to
convince
us
of
one
side
or
the
other
of
the
newer
element
debate.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you
very
much.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
those
are
purpose
sort
of
to
define
the
public
interest,
is
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
did.
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
we
wholely
disagreed
with
you
and
found
of
as
really
unreasonable.
we
were
–
we
are
nonetheless
duly
found
to
follow
the
statute
whatever
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
question
whether
we
agree
with
you
strongly
or
disagree
with
you
strongly?
question
is
what
the
statute
provider
requires?
