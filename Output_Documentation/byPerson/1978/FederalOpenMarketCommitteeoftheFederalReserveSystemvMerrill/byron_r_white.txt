justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
geller,
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question.
suppose
this
group
met
weekly
instead
of
monthly
and
the
lag
were
only
seven
days
instead
of
30,
would
you
might
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
your
opposition
would
say
still
that
it
affected
its
academic
needs
as
the
obligation
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
geller,
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying
that
26(c)(7)
doesn’t
apply
to
any
kind
of
a
governmental
entity,
which
i
guess
they
decided,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
it’s
wrong
in
that
and
we
say
that
the
government
in
an
foia
case
can
take
advantage
of
26(c)(7),
then
the
other
litigate
can
take
advantage.
suppose
it
was
decided
that
this
was
not
confidential
commercial
information.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
it
was
decided
that
way,
you
wouldn’t
nevertheless
argue
that
it
would
be
non-discoverable
under
some
other
rule.
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
when
you
move
to
some
other
rule,
the
part
of
your
argument
is
the
need
for
secrecy.
and
that
were
decided
that
26(c)(7)
wouldn’t
protect
it.
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
is
utterly
destroyed,
but
i
am
not
suggesting
the
26(c)(7)
would
be
decided
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
heart
argument
there
is
a
need
for
secrecy.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
need
for
secrecy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
which
advantage
you
would
think
that
he
would
protect
it
under
(c)(7)
a
fortiori?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
it
is
the
confidential
commercial
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
thought
you
are
suggesting
is
incorrect.
justice
byron
r.
white
including
that
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
now,
suppose
you
are
right
that
(c)(7)
does
apply
in
the
government
like
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
government
in
case
like
this
and
suppose
that
the
government
shows
its
confidential
commercial
information,
is
the
district
court
nevertheless
privileged
then
to
say,
well,
i
am
going
to
balance
a
little
bit
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
(c)(7)
absolute
or
isn’t
it,
if
it’s
confidential?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
not
any
more
room
for
balancing,
if
(c)(7)
applies
and
there
is
confidential
commercial
information.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
kramer
you
are
defending
the
court
of
appeals
that,
the
judgment
opinion
however
says
that
the
federal
rule
of
several
procedure
26
(c)(7)
is
not
applicable
to
the
defendant.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
it
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong,
you
can
conceive
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
we
do
if
we
are
disagreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
issue?
would
we
be
remanded
or
would
be
decided
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
we
just
decided
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
26
(c)(7)?
what
if
decided
that
it
was
available
to
the
government
in
an
appropriate
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
policy
statement
can
possibly
be
confidential
commercial
information.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
policy
can
contain
confidential
information
within
the
meaning
of
26
(c)(7).
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
way
you
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
by
the
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
it
certainly
is
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
as
weigh
if
there
in
so
far
as
exemption
if
i
pick
some
specific
privilege
available
in
civil
litigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
thus
it
relies
on
26
(c)(7)?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
specific
as
you
can
be
as
that
--
that’s
confidential
commercial
installation.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
your
only
answer
to
that,
i
mean
it’s
certainly
is
not
because
of
vagueness
or
anything,
is
there
is
a
specific
privilege?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
may
be
that
was
never
challenged.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
here
is
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
neighbor
board
decides
to
order
a
regional
directive
to
file
a
complaint
and
you
write
him
a
letter
and
say,
we
talk
this
all
over
and
our
policy
now
is
so
and
so
file
is
complain
is,
is
that
the,
i
mean
is
that,
that’s
exempted,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
yes,
it
him
--
your
answer
is
that
it’s
within
the
exemption5?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
doesn’t
finally
dispose
of
anything
and
it
just
sets
the
government
on
of
a
course
of
action
mainly
litigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
government
adopts
of
--
it
has
meeting
and
it
says
we
are
going
to
start
on
a
course
--
we
are
going
to
embark
on
a
course
of
action
right
now
and
here
is
what
we
are
going
to
do,
and
we
are
going
to
order
our
open
market
operator
for
the
next
two
or
three
months
to
do
so
and
so.
well
it
doesn’t
finally
dispose
off
any
case.
it
doesn’t
finally
dispose
off
any
course
of
action.
it’s
an
initiation
of
a
course
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
it’s
a
misnomer
or
not,
you
must
agree
that
it
is
an
initiation
of
a
course
of
action
by
the
government,
these
statements
or
policy
or
nothing?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
do,
but
i
am
just
asking
you
whatever
you
look
at,
doesn’t
it
set
the
government
on
a
course
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
doesn’t
finish
it,
it
just
starts
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
that
was
just
exactly
the
line
that
was
drawn
in
the
series
case,
which
you
think
was
so
carefully
constructed.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
exactly
the
line,
that
the
opinions
that
finally
dispose
off
a
case,
like
opinions
not
to
file
a
complaint,
they
are
discoverable,
but
opinions
in
statements
or
policy
if
you
want
to
call
them
that,
saying
file
are
not
discoverable.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
told
to
me
i
could
not
understand
it
anyway.
[laughter]
