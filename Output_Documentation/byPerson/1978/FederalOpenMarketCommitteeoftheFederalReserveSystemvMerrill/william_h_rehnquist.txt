justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
question
mr.
geller
about
the
discretion
contention.
here
the
district
court
simply
required
the
production
of
the
documents.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
i
take
it
your
contention
is
that
the
discretion
could
only
be
exercised
in
one
way
in
this
particular
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
don’t
claim
that
it
comes
under
any
of
the
exemptions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
section
that
you
are
dealing
with
the
exemptions
beginning
this
section
does
not
apply
to
matters
that
are,
and
then
5
says
inter-agency
or
intra-agency
memorandums
or
letters
which
would
not
be
available
by
law
to
a
party
other
than
the
agency
and
litigation
with
the
agency.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
where
does
the
district
court’s
discretion
stand
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it’s
a
rather
peculiar
way
of
achieving
any
result,
isn’t
that?
[laughter].
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
analogy
do
you
draw?
you
talk
about
litigation
with
an
agency,
you
have
to
envision
some
hypothetical
case
in
which
the
agency
is
a
defendant
and
someone
else
is
a
plaintiff.
you
have
no
idea
what
the
subject
matter
the
litigation
is.
do
you
limit
it
just
to
privileges
that
are
recognized
in
every
discovery
situation
or
do
you
interpret
in
terms
of
a
rule
to
compel
disclosure
under
rule
26?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
question
was
most
adjunctive.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
hypothecates
the
government
being
on
one
side
and
the
public
interest
being
on
the
other.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kramer,
supposing
that
in
a
federal
torque
claims
that
case,
which
the
government
is
defending,
so
presumably
it’s
not
under
the
law
enforcement
exemption,
the
section
chief
after
conference
with
his
associates
in
the
department
sends
a
letter
of
instruction
to
the
us
attorney
in
the
field
saying,
‘reject
the
plaintiff’s
offer
a
$50,000,
make
a
counteroffer
to
him
of
$35,000
and
try
to
settle
for
$40,000’.
now
that
decision
has
been
made,
the
us
attorney
in
the
field
was
simply
caring
out
instructions.
do
you
think
the
freedom
of
information
act,
plaintiff
could
come
in
and
ask
to
see
a
copy
of
that
letter
before
the
settlement
conference
was
over?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
does
have
something
to
do
with
your
insistence
that
sears,
roebuck
case
limited
to
pre-decisional
conferences
because
the
policy
is
already
adopted,
it
simply
hasn’t
been
effectuated.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
the
lots
of
stuff
as
you
pointed
out
in
response
to
the
chief
justice,
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
published,
but
it’s
nonetheless
discovered.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
not
it
be
literally
incredible
to
think
that
congress
intended
the
publication
of
the
kind
of
letter
i
have
in
mind.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
agencies
--
what
about
the
justice
department
policy
that
we
will
under
no
circumstances
certainly
toward
claims
act
suit
for
more
than
$100,000,
sent
to
all
93
us
attorneys
around
the
country?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
federal
tort
claims
act
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
claiming
only
under
subsection
2
here
rather
than
under
subsection
3
as
well?
are
you
claiming
that
this
is
discoverable
or
available
because
of
the
statement
of
policy
or
are
you
claiming
that
it’s
a
record,
which
an
agency
has
a
copy
of?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wouldn’t
have
to
be
statement
of
policy
to
come
under
theory
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
are
both
subject
to
exemption
number
5?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
is
an
intra-agency
memorandum,
is
it
not
or
inter-agency?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
intra?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
it
has
to
be
tested
anywhere
by
whether
would
be
available
in
civil
litigation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn’t
that
require
a
--
that’s
going
to
require
some
litigation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don’t
have
a
law
suite,
other
way
you
would
normally
observe
that
district
court
can
simply
say
a
snap
judgment,
i
have
known
about
this
law
so
it
burdensome,
i
would
not
require
not
burdensome,
i
will
require
--
he
has
got
almost
hypothetical
law
suit
with
the
same
sort
effects,
that
you
say
we
would
have
to
go
back
for
a
trial.
