mrs.
beale,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
about
the
eight-lanes
superhighway
as
justice
stewart
has
suggested,
you
can
have
anything
from
a
--
of
a
footpath
to
a
swimming
hole
perhaps
to
the
eight-lane
superhighway.
if
there's
no
definition
of
the
reservation
for
which
you
argue,
would
it
be
permissible
under
your
theory
of
the
case
if
--
for
the
government
to
say,
what
we
really
need
is
the
superhighway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
--
why
not?
