mr.

chief

e.
burger
does
this
record
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
shows
to
much,
to
what
extent
the
rights
of
way
were
taken
by
condemnation
either
federal
or
state
over
this
whole
history
that
is
i
don't
mean
precisely,
was
--

--was
there
a
lot
of
right
of
way
and
a
lot
of
money
or
just
a
small
amount?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
little
puzzling
why
this
has
taken
so
long
to
mature
into
this
situation,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
later
it
became
--some
of
it
became
very
valuable
timberland,
isn't
it,
and
as
today
is
that
not
so?

very
well.
mr.
martz,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
might
be
more
complex
than
the
kind
of
litigation
we
traditionally
have
over
a
condemnation,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.

yes.

normally
when
the
sovereign
is
going
to
condemn
land
for
a
road
or
for
any
other
purpose,
the
sovereign
says,
it
shall
be
here.
if
none,
devaluation
is
determined
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
after
that.
the
court
is
--
or
could
it
--
does
a
question,
does
the
court
ordinarily
in
a
condemnation
get
into
the
question
of
where
the
road
shall
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
road
is
day
to
day,
they
--
the
passageway
is
determined
according
to
need
and
presumably
the
engineers
take
into
account
the
most
economical
way
to
put
the
road
in?
