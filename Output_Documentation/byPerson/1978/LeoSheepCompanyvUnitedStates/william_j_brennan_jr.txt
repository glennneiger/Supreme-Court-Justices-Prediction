justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
tell
me
what's
been
happening
about
this
for
a
110
years
mr.
martz?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--there
must
have
been
rights
of
way
all
this
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
martz,
following
up
on
justice
blackmun's
question.
is
it
not
true,
if
you
look
at
the
checkerboard
that
it
would
always
be
possible
to
get
from
--to
stay
on
government
land
except
where
you
have
to
cross
at
corners,
you
could
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
--isn't
it
possible
that
congress
--you've
mentioned
the
widespread
understanding
that
people
could
post
any
place
they
wanted
to
in
the
west
in
those
days
without
worrying
about
having
someone
build
a
fence
in
front
of
them.
isn't
likely
that
congress
didn't
dream
that
there'd
been
any
problem
of
cutting
across
a
corner
every
mile
or
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
knew
there
would
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
at
least
to
start
with.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
is
the
private
landowner
doesn't
have
the
right
of
eminent
domain,
does
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
beale,
then
you
would
measure
reasonable
as
of
1862
rather
than
as
of
today,
isn't
it
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
your
position
be
the
same
assuming
that
within
two
or
three
years
after
the
transfer
to
the
railroad,
the
government
had
sold
all
of
the
section
1622
and
14
to
a
private
owner.
would
that
private
owner
have
precisely
the
same
claim
the
government
is
now
asserting?
and
then
the
private
owner
developed
the
reservoir?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
relied
at
all
on
the
fact
that
it
is
the
united
states
government
were
to
solve
or
anything
like
that?
it
would
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
was
precisely
the
same
claim
could
be
made
by
an
assignee
if
the
government
sent
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
--
i
want
to
make
sure
i
didn't
misunderstand
something,
earlier
you
said,
you
do
not
take
the
position
however
that
the
railroad
had
a
corresponding
right
as
against
the
reserved
lands?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
would
they
--
they
were
going
to
sell
to
people
who
would
be
neighbors.
why
would
that
be
different?
i
just
--
i
need
some
help
on
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
must
--
i'm
--
perhaps
not
grasping
the
full
period.
you
say
the
grantees
from
the
railroad
had
a
right
to
locate
roads
over
the
reserved
public
lands.
but
what
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
public
lands
had
been
sold
in
the
meantime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
am
i
correct
--
let
me
just
stick
with
this
to
be
sure
i
understand.
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
at
least
it
was
theoretically
possible,
if
all
the
land
was
sold
that
the
people
in
the
odd-numbered
sections
would
not
have
the
right
you
say
the
people
in
the
even-numbered
sections
would
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
said
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
reasonable
that
congress
so
intended?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
received
but
they
understanding
and
they
would
resell,
wasn't
it,
that
part
of
the
idea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
understanding
it
would
be
financing
and
therefore,
they
were
expected
to
resell,
i
know
that
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
true,
but
they
were
expected
to
develop
the
land
and
thereby
enhanced
the
value
of
the
retained
government
lands.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
somehow
they
