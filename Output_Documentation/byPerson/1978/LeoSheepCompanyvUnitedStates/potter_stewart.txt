that
got
to
be
a
very
politically
hot
potato
after
awhile,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
internal
improvements
that
was
coming
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
everybody
--
justice
potter
stewart
--in
congress
shied
away
from
that
phrase?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course,
many
roads
were
built
across
those
kinds
of
land
by
the
land
authorities
--
justice
potter
stewart
--by
state
or
local
government
and
by
condemnation.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
british
capital
that
finally
built
the
union
pacific,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
gave
guys
money
for
it.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
the
railroads
did
was
to
sell
them
to
their
own
subsidiaries,
isn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
charged
with
that.
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
were
a
lot
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
are
we
--
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
claiming
reservation,
aren't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
not
an
easement
by
necessity,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
since
the
grantee
with
the
power
of
eminent
domain
can
never
show
an
easement
by
necessity
because
it
--
there
is
no
necessity.
it
can
always
condemn?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
you're
claiming
a
reservation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
follow
up
my
brother
rehnquist
question,
now
are
we
hearing
the
area
of
real
property
law
or
we
are
--
are
we
in
the
area
of
simple
legislative
construction?
justice
potter
stewart
do
it
also
follows
that
in
the
--
that
the
grant
to
the
railroad
was
also
a
grant
of
an
easement
over
the
retained
property
of
the
government,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
same
circumstances
applied,
each
one
is
land
lock
so
to
speak,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
since
1862,
countless
roads
have
been
constructed
through
these
areas,
have
they
by
state
and
local
governments
by
the
power
of
eminent
domain?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event
in
the
last
116
years,
many,
many
new
roads
had
been
constructed
through
these
areas,
haven't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
often
--
often
as
through
the
exercise
of
eminent
domain
by
--
by
state
and
local
governments,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
the
general
areas
where
we
have
the
checkerboard
system
as
a
the
result
of
the
1862
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
116
years
to
avoid
this
basic
question
hand
arisen
before
in
a
116
years
and
it
occurred
to
me
the
reason
is
that
they
--
as
a
practical
matter
doesn't
often
arise
because
there
are
roads
through
this
area.
there
is
access
by
public
roadway.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
for
the
government,
for
the
public.
justice
potter
stewart
that
this
is
by
the
public
to
this
late
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
public
roadway,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
for
just
--
to
federal
use?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
accessed
by
--
for
the
general
public?
justice
potter
stewart
to
this
recreational
area?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
generally
--
ordinarily
be
served
by
a
public
road.
justice
potter
stewart
so
to
that
extent
--
justice
potter
stewart
normally
in
--
this
is
more
than
just
an
easement
if
--
as
we
agree
as
this
for
the
--
for
public,
use
as
a
public
road.
it's
more
than
an
easement
for
just
to
access,
ingress
and
egress
over
a
piece
of
property
which
the
fee
title
owner
retains
title
to
as
suggested
by
my
brother
marshall.
this
is
a
--
a
road
generally
is
--
the
title
goes
to
the
governmental
body
that
owns
and
operates
the
road?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
in
other
words,
there
couldn't
be
grazing
or
anything
else
on
this
road,
if
it's
a
road.
and
if
you're
right,
it's
more
than
just
an
easement
of
once
a
day
or
once
a
week,
the
--
an
adjacent
owner
going
over
it?
justice
potter
stewart
cross
easements
--
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
cross
easements
of
adjacent
landowners?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
not
a
public
road?
justice
potter
stewart
the
easement
belongs
to
the
fee
title
owner
of
the
center
of
the
donut
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
his
use.
it's
not
for
the
use
of
the
public.
justice
potter
stewart
his
use
including
his
visitors.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
my
--
that
was
going
to
be
my
question.
ordinarily,
when
the
federal
government
wants
to
build
a
public
road
and
proceeds
to
acquire
the
property
by
condemnation
proceedings
does
it
try
to
acquire
just
and
easement
or
does
it
try
to
acquire
the
fee?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
they
sell
it
or
else
it
would
be
subject
to
a
homestead
in
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
they
--
