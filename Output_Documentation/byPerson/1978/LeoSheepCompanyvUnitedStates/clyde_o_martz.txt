mr.
clyde
o.
martz
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
reserved
rights
of
way
across
some
34
million
acres
of
land
that
were
patented
in
support
of
the
transcontinental
railroad
construction
under
the
union
pacific
act
of
1862.
the
act
is
very
straightforward.
section
3
makes
a
grant
of
every
alternate
section
of
public
land
designated
by
odd
numbers
to
the
amount
of
five
alternate
sections
per
mile
on
each
side
of
the
railroad.
this
number
was
amended
two
years
later
to
increase
it
to
ten.
the
purpose
is
stated
in
section
3
as
aiding
in
the
construction
of
said
railroad
and
telegraph
line
and
to
secure
the
safe
and
speed
transportation
of
the
male
troops,
munitions
of
war
in
public
stores
thereon.congress
made
three
categories
of
exceptions.
first
is
provided
for
an
exception
for
land
sold,
reserved
or
otherwise
disposed
off
by
the
united
states
prior
to
the
fixing
of
the
road.
secondly,
it
exempted
or
it
excepted
mineral
lands.
and
third,
it
excluded
or
required
a
reversion
of
lands
not
sold
or
disposed
off
within
three
years
after
the
completion
of
the
road.
it
contain
no
exceptions
or
reservations
of
any
kind
for
rights
of
way
across
the
lands
granted
and
this
is
not
an
issue
or
in
dispute
in
the
case.
section
4
then
directed
that
after
acceptance
of
each
40
miles
of
line
constructed.
patent
shall
issue
conveying
the
right
and
title
of
said
lands
to
the
company.
and
it
provides
no
qualification
with
respect
to
the
right
or
title
of
lands
that
are
conveyed.
petitioners
in
this
case
are
successors
and
enters
to
the
railroad
grants
of
section
3
lands
on
the
east
side
of
seminoe
reservoir
in
the
state
of
wyoming
and
have
grants
under
section
4
without
reservation
of
any
kind
in
the
patents
for
crossing.
petitioners
also
hold
the
alternate,
even-numbered
sections
under
grazing
license
pursuant
to
the
taylor
grazing
act
of
1934.
the
controversy
in
this
case
arose
in
december
of
1973,
when
officers
and
agents
of
the
department
of
interior
commenced
constructing
a
road
from
a
public
highway
westerly
to
the
eastern
shore
of
seminoe
reservoir
across
public
domain
sections
and
the
alternating
checkerboard
lands
of
petitioner's
patent
that
under
the
1862
act.
they
did
this
without
consent
of
the
landowners
without
payment
of
any
compensation
or
fencing
on
the
road
for
the
protection
of
the
lands
crossed.
petitioners
filed
an
action
to
quiet
title
against
this
claim.
the
parties
stipulated
as
to
the
facts
and
submitted
the
matter
to
the
federal
district
court
in
wyoming
for
--on
cross
motions
of
summary
judgment
on
the
title
issue.
the
district
court
quieted
title
in
the
plaintiffs
concluding
that
were
no
rights
of
way
reserved
either
expressly
or
by
implication.
secondly,
that
the
--no
rights
of
way
by
necessity
could
be
implied
in
the
favor
of
the
sovereign
since
the
sovereign
has
the
power
of
eminent
domain
to
take
such
ways
as
it
needs
all
times.
and
the
court
further
found
that
for
110
years
after
the
grant
of
the
fee
lands
to
the
union
pacific
railroad
company,
neither
the
department
of
the
interior
nor
any
other
agency
or
agent
of
the
united
states
construed
the
grant
or
the
patents
issued
pursuant
thereto
as
conferring
any
right
upon
the
united
states
as
agents
or
the
public
to
traverse
the
lands
granted
to
the
railroad.
on
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit
court
that
decision
was
reversed,
court
of
appeals
finding
that
there
was
a
right
of
way
reserved
by
implication
saying,
“to
hold
to
the
contrary
would
be
to
ascribe
to
congress
the
degree
of
carelessness
or
lack
of
foresight
which
in
our
view
would
be
unwarranted”.
petitioner
submit
that
the
decision
of
this
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
affirmed
for
several
reasons.
the
first
and
foremost
being
that
the
court
of
appeals
presumed
an
intent
that
was
not
expressed
anywhere
by
congress
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
debates
or
in
the
language
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
considered
no
administrative
experience
under
the
act
in
110
years
of
patenting
of
lands.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
mr.
justice
brennan,
absolutely
nothing.
the
united
states
in
his
brief
acknowledges
that
it
has
acquired
rights
of
way
by
purchase
when
it's
needed
them.
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
there
has
never
been
a
condemnation
action
to
acquire
a
right
of
way.
it
would
appear
your
honor
that
this
is
a
new
idea
that
was
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
history
of
the
union
pacific
act
and
the
way
in
which
this
alternate
section
concept
was
used
by
congress
to
encourage
settlement
and
development
of
the
lands
and
support
the
railroad
--this
becomes
understandable.
congress
started
back
in
1827,
according
to
the
legislative
history,
in
providing
support
for
public
improvements
by
contributing
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
public
lands.
it
did
this
for
canals,
it
did
it
for
highways
and
it
did
it
starting
in
1850
for
railroads.
the
idea
was
that
it
would
give
the
proceeds
of
sale
to
an
enterprise
that
was
providing
a
public
improvement.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that
is
right
your
honor.
and
one
response
to
the
political
hot
potato
was
the
checkerboard
pattern.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
congress
was
criticized
for
giving
away
land.
so
it
theorized
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
internal
improvements,
yes.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that
if
we
were
to
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
right.
and
it
provided
that
what
we're
going
to
do
is
subsidize
the
project
with
alternate
sections
and
we
retain
the
intervening
section
for
sale
for
the
public
treasury
and
if
settlement
occurs
and
the
country
grows,
the
land
retained
can
be
sold
for
double
value
when
we
recover
the
price
of
the
subsidy.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
now,
it
look
that
the
enterprise
as
promoting
settlement
through
sale
of
lands
concurrently
with
entries
under
the
preemption
acts
of
the
alternate
sections.
and
in
the
experience
for
35
years,
from
1827
to
1862,
the
lands
were
settled
in
the
--along
the
canals
and
the
highways
without
reservation
of
rights
of
way,
without
rights
of
way
problems,
and
without
creating
a
checkerboard
pattern
of
land
ownership.
it
is
a
case
where
a
person
settling
on
an
odd
section
of
land,
pays
one
seller.
he
settles
on
an
even
section
of
land,
he
pays
another.
now,
this
was
the
picture
in
1862
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
precisely.
the
land
was
not
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
and
simply
by
the
cooperative
efforts
of
the
settlers.
as
we
know
when
people
moved
west
to
settle,
they
followed
trails
of
convenience
whether
it
went
across
public
or
private
lands,
was
of
no
concern
to
either.
there
was
a
--as
this
court
has
developed
in
the
buford
case
and
the
camfield
case
that
has
come
up
with
--under
the
inclosures
act
questions.
it
is
recognized,
a
law
of
the
open
range
where
people
had
a
right
to
push
livestock,
graze
livestock
on
unfenced
lands
without
regard
to
land
ownerships.
this
was
the
plan
but
there's
another
fuzz
of
it.
congress
wanted
this
transcontinental
railroad.
it
had
been
trying
to
get
it
from
the
mid
1850s.
it
was
a
big
gamble
because
there
was
nothing
west
to
the
missouri
but
indians
and
(inaudible).
the
railroad
was
created
by
the
act,
union
pacific
road
but
it
could
not
get
private
capital
to
support
this
gamble.
this
court
reviewed
the
pressures
on
congress
in
the
platte
case
in
1879
and
said
strikingly,
“enough".
"we
do
not
now
attempt
to
portray
the
earnestness,
the
all
absorbing
earnestness
with
which
congress
sought
to
secure
the
construction
of
the
road
by
private
enterprise".
in
1862,
it
gave
five
sections
of
land
on
either
side
of
the
road.
in
1864,
it
increased
it
to
ten
sections.
this
court
said
in
platte
that
was
necessary
to
push
the
project.
the
court
said,
“suffice
it
to
say
the
purpose
of
congress
above
all
others
was
to
obtain
the
construction
of
the
railroad
by
the
corporation
that
created
to
undertake
the
work".
for
that
alone,
the
subsidy
bonds
were
given
and
only
for
that
the
grants
of
land
were
made.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
i
--i'm
not
aware
of
that.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
what's
what
sir?
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
i
don't
have
that
(voice
overlap)
for
it.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
was
there
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
no.
as
far
--you
may
--are
you
speaking
of
the
private
condemnation
or
government
condemnation
to
get
the
rights
of
way
across
these
tracks.
as
far
as
the
record
shows
your
honor
in
all
three
levels
of
court,
there
has
not
been
a
condemnation
proceeding
initiated
by
the
united
states.
at
least
none
has
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
any
court
by
the
government.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
well,
may
i
suggest
that
as
the
lands
were
in
fact
settled
in
the
west,
if
we
leave
out
the
checkerboard
pattern
for
a
moment.
you
do
had
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested,
had
a
day
to
day,
week
to
week
evolution
of
road
or
trail
construction
which
trails
became
road
by
prescriptive
easement.
the
land
was
not
of
great
value
and
access
was
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
well,
this
happened,
yes,
through
the
years
when
rights
of
way
might
be
purchased.
i
recalled,
this
court
said
in
the
camfield
case
of
every
landowner
has
a
right
to
enclose
his
own
land
and
obviously,
if
he
does
this,
this
man
interfere
with
access
to
the
other
lands.
but
the
court
said,
“this
can't
really
be
a
practical
problem
until
such
time
as
the
west
is
fully
settled
and
at
that
point
there
will
be
roads
to
the
union".
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes,
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
we
are
talking
of
very
few
dollars.
we're
talking
only
about
a
principle
that
if
this
checkerboard
lands
were
patented
without
reservation.
the
issue
today
is
not
really
whether
the
united
states
or
any
other
private
party
has
a
right
of
access
to
cross
a
section
of
land
to
reach
an
adjoining
section
of
land.
the
kind
of
case
in
which
this
question
is
being
raised
is
precisely
the
kind
that
gave
rise
to
this
controversy,
the
construction
of
a
roadway
across
a
ranch
area
for
access
not
of
a
few
people
but
of
the
public
to
a
recreational
area
without
fencing
the
road
for
the
protection
of
the
integrity
of
the
ranching
area.
these
are
the
kind
of
questions
in
which
this
issue
will
be
raised
and
it's
on
these
kinds
of
questions
that
we
need
clarification
of
these
rights.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that's
right.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
congress
didn't
dream
that
there
would
be
checkerboard
ownership
of
the
land
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
--
through
the
support
program.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
no,
your
honor.
it
already
had
35
years
of
experience
in
entering
lands
in
the
alternate
section
basis.
had
the
railroads
in
moving
west
followed
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
obtained
patents
as
they've
completed
each
40-mile
piece
of
land
and
sold
those
lands
off
to
settlers
to
raise
money
to
continue
to
build
the
road
as
it
happen
with
the
canal
program
in
the
east.
you
would
have
scattered
settlements
on
odd
and
even
numbered
sections.
the
same
as
you
would
have
under
the
homestead
process.
what
happened
that
congress
could
not
have
anticipated
in
1862
when
it
enacted
the
homestead
act
opening
the
west
and
that
railroad
grant
act
for
the
union
pacific
road
was
that
for
the
first
time
the
public
enterprise
would
not
sell
the
land
to
settlers
but
would
mortgage
it
in
its
entireties.
it
was
the
mortgaging
process
that
created
a
pattern
of
checkerboard
ownership
that
became
a
matter
of
concern
10
years
after
the
grants
were
first
made.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that
is
correct.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
in
the
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
well,
there
was
an
enlarged
homestead
act
first
and
i
can't
give
you
the
data,
1890
or
1900.
i
don't
know,
the
stock
raising
homestead
act
went
to
640.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
well,
your
honor,
it
was
really
contemporaneous
that
congress
had
had
no
experience
under
the
homestead
act.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
it
passed
the
same
congress
and
that
--and
homestead
access
were
opening
the
west.
you
can
settle
in
a
160-acre
family
units.
it
said
to
the
railroads,
"we're
granting
alternate
sections
to
you
for
you
to
dispose
of".
it
did
not
to
be
sure
limit
the
size
of
the
disposition
but
it
did
say
any
lands
which
have
not
been
disposed
of
in
three
years
after
the
completion
of
the
road
will
then
be
open
to
entry
only
under
the
homestead
in
preemption
laws.
so
congress
was
looking
at
the
sale
of
lands
while
the
railroad
was
being
constructed
and
the
residual
lands
would
become
part
of
the
public
domain
package.
and
it
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
they
--the
railroads
were
engaged
in
a
great
deal
of
fraud
--at
least
they
were
charged
with
a
great
deal
of
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
--of
fraud.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
to
a
point
where
congress
and
this
is
most
significant
to
that
after
the
problem
of
the
checkerboard
grants
became
very
real
during
the
range
wars
of
the
1880s
and
1890s
where
as
you
say,
let
these
packages
lands
were
transferred
to
subsidiaries
or
to
private
companies
who
tried
to
utilize
the
checkerboard
pattern
of
ownership
to
seize
control
of
great
amounts
of
the
public
lands.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
and
led
to
the
enactment
of
the
unlawful
inclosures
act
in
1885.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
and
it
led
congress
in
1887
to
affirm
the
titles
of
bona
fide
purchasers
from
the
railroads.
had
congress
had
any
reservation
at
all
as
to
whether
it
had
or
had
not
made
a
reservation
of
rights
of
way
in
1862?
it
certainly
had
the
right
when
it
affirmed
the
patents
of
bona
fide
purchasers
in
1887
declare
that.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
well
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
no.
to
be
sure
mr.
justice
marshall,
they
were
not
--have
built
the
railroad.
they
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
but
it
was
the
area
between
where
--what
were
--that
the
theory
was
that
the
grants
of
these
lands
would
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
well,
it
did
not
retain
easements
in
homestead
grants.
as
a
matter
fact
united
states
has
not
retained
an
easement
of
this
kind
in
any
grant.
as
this
court
said
in
platte,
the
purpose
of
the
grants
was
to
support
the
road.
it
was
to
enable
the
railroad
to
sell
these
lands
to
settlers
moving
along
the
road
west
and
using
the
money
for
the
construction
of
road.
now,
if
congress
allowed
homesteads
on
even-numbered
sections
without
any
reservation
of
right
and
said
on
the
odd-numbered
section
you,
mr.
railroad,
you've
got
to
give
us
an
easement
undefined
across
that
land.
how
successful
would
the
railroad
have
been
in
competing
with
the
homestead
act
in
selling
any
lands,
assuming
the
lands
were
off
equal
quality?
the
purpose,
this
court
said
in
platte
was
to
support
the
railroad
and
to
settle
the
west.
that
the
three-judge
dissenting
opinion
in
platte
is
i
think
very
helpful
in
getting
this
whole
matter
in
focus.
this
was
a
court
speaking
at
the
time
when
congressional
intent
was
still
fresh
efore
in
everybody's
mind.
the
majority
in
platte
allowed
the
railroads
to
hold
this
acreage
on
the
theory
that
the
mortgaging
was
a
disposition
so
that
within
the
three
years
after
completion
of
the
road,
the
railroad
didn't
have
to
either
settled
it
or
give
it
back
for
entry
under
the
homestead
or
preemption
laws,
it
could
held
it.
the
dissent
in
platte
said,
"this
is
not
what
congress
ever
intended.
congress
intended
these
lands
to
be
settled
and
that
the
railroads
would
not
be
able
to
hold
them
by
mortgage.it
could
not
hold
this
land
locked
checkerboard
patterned".
and
had
the
will
of
congress
been
carried
out
without
the
mortgaging
process,
we
wouldn't
have
these
problems
today.
but
the
fact
remains
the
lands
were
patented.
there
was
no
reservation.
the
legislative
history
would
affirmed
the
fact
that
there
was
no
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
make
such
reservation.
now
that
--i
want
to
save
five
minutes
for
rebuttal
but
i
want
to
make
one
comment
about
the
two
pieces
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
not
as
precedent
but
as
comfort
in
support
of
its
decision,
this
being
the
buford
case
and
the
camfield
case
that
came
up
with
respect
to
the
practices
that
were
then
in
existence
of
getting
monopolies
on
the
public
lands
by
use
of
this
checkerboard
acreage.
buford
said,
“no
private
landowner
can
enjoin
or
recovery
trespass
damage
for
the
crossing
of
unfenced
open
lands
associated
with
the
public
domain”.
camfield
said,
“it's
a
public
nuisance
for
the
holder
of
checkerboard
lands
to
fence
it
and
thereby
even
though
the
fences
are
on
private
lands
enclosed
blocks
the
public
domain".
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
the
act
of
congress
saying,
"there
shall
not
be
an
enclosure".
the
point
gentleman
i
want
to
make
is
that
that
in
both
of
the
acts
and
both
of
the
cases.
looking
first
at
buford,
this
court
made
it
clear
that
what
it
was
speaking
off
is
the
custom
of
the
open
range
and
it
lasted
for
a
hundred
years
that
you
cross
land
whether
in
public
or
private
ownership,
in
cattle
drives
or
with
grazing
without
liability
and
trespass
or
without
hindrance.
if
the
private
landowner
wanted
to
protect
his
land,
he
had
to
fence
it.
and
this
court
said
in
camfield,
"if
he
fences
it,
he
is
entitled
to
exclusive
possession".
now,
the
court
below
and
the
government
said
--have
argued,
that
these
cases
suggest
the
existence
of
rights
of
way
across
the
odd-numbered
sections
because
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
make
a
couple
of
comments
and
then
see
if
the
court
has
any
questions
with
me.
i
thought
that
the
counsel's
analysis
of
the
relationship
between
the
odd
and
even-numbered
sections
provided
an
answer
to
a
question
mr.
justice
blackmun
put
to
me
yesterday
which
is
really
what
at
stake
in
this
controversy.
counsel
says
that
the
--
if
the
successors
and
enters
to
the
odd-numbered
sections,
one
access
across
the
alternate
even-numbered
sections
if
still
in
public
ownership
they
may
seek
a
permit
from
the
secretary
of
interior.
there's
nothing
in
the
law
that
says
that
permit
has
to
be
granted
or
that
it
would
be
granted
free
of
terms
and
conditions
and
restrictions.
if
those
lands
have
passed
a
private
ownership
by
homesteading,
counsel
had
made
it
very
clear
that
the
homestead
had
took
a
free
title
without
any
encumbrance
upon
if
for
the
benefit
of
the
alternate
odd-numbered
sections.
but
if
the
united
states
either
for
access
to
the
alternate
even-numbered
sections
or
for
public
access
to
a
development
such
as
seminoe
reservoir
wants
to
use
the
private
lands
of
successors
and
enters
of
the
railroad
they
can
take
that
road
without
compensation,
determine
the
size
of
the
burden
where
the
road
will
be
located
with
the
right
in
the
landowner
to
either
negotiate
for
some
alternative.
or
to
go
to
court
and
seek
a
determination
that
the
easement
is
excessive.
the
landowner
may
have
paid
taxes
upon
the
land
subject
to
the
taking
of
a
road
for
an
easement.
i
think
if
the
court
would
look
at
united
states
against
ridge
--
ringe
in
the
southern
district
of
california
cited
on
page
19
of
our
brief.
we
see
the
burden
that's
posed
--
that's
put
on
the
ranching
landowner
of
the
government
exercising
these
rights
of
driving
roadways
or
highways
willy-nilly
across
ranch
lands,
breaking
it
up
into
parcels
and
destroying
the
utility
of
the
land,
now
in
the
hands
of
purchasers
for
value
based
upon
clear
patents
and
a
clear
record
title
by
examination.
if
the
government
has
to
go
by
con
--
the
condemnation
route,
it
will
have
to
pay
not
just
for
the
small
bits
of
land
on
corner
crossings
but
it
must
--
going
to
have
to
address
the
impairment
of
value
to
the
residual
lands
caused
by
the
opening
of
unfenced
public
access
routes
across
consolidated
ranch
areas.
this
court
has
said
many
times
as
cited
on
page
24
of
petitioner's
brief
that
a
construction
that
others
title
securities
should
be
limited
to
cases
where
there
is
a
compelling
need
and
that
litigation
should
be
avoided
as
a
consequence
of
a
construction.
here
we
have
a
case
where
we
have
had
a
uniformed
administrative
construction
for
a
100
and
now
16
years.
it's
apparent
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
sustained,
we're
going
to
impose
an
encumbrance
upon
some
a
131,000
acres
that
had
been
patented
under
language
like
section
3
in
this
and
other
acts.
it's
not
illogically
that
we're
also
going
to
cloud
a
100
million
acres
of
title
in
these
reserved
even-numbered
sections.
and
as
--
the
government
has
pointed
out
in
our
argument,
we're
going
to
have
litigation
over
the
size
and
burden
of
these
rights
of
way.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
much
more
so
particularly
when
the
values
that
counsel
describes
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
we
shall
i
finish?
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
the
values
described
are
not
significant
unless
there
is
an
impairment
of
beneficial
use
of
the
adjoining
lands.
it
would
not
likely
go
to
condemnation
because
the
values
are
not
significantly
enough
for
that
purpose.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
right.
that
is
correct.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
the
united
states
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
well,
the
united
states
can
take
the
road
any
point
it
thinks
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
project
and
then
damages
are
computed
on
the
basis
of
the
burden
resulting
to
the
private
lands.
thank
you
your
honor.
