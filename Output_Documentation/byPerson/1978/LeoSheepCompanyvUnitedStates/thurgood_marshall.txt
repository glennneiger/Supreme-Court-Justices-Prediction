justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
do
i
just
as
an
individual
apply
all
of
that
which
came
about
at
the
time
to
quote
you,
there
was
none
beyond
missouri
but
(inaudible)
indians
when
at
the
time
when
california
was
the
largest
state
in
the
union.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
to
bring
it
down
to
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
of
myself,
i
mean
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
great
difficulty
with
the
united
states
government
giving
away
my
land
without
retaining
an
easement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
this
is
a
permanent
road,
the
owner
would
never
had
anymore
use
of
that
corner?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
while
the
road
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
while
the
federal
government
was
using
it
and
the
public
was
using
it,
and
he
couldn't
use
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
rather,
the
sheep
could've
used
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
sheep,
cattle,
bulldogs,
whatever
it
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
couldn't
use
it.
the
land
is
gone
so
far
as
the
private
owner
is
concerned.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
he
pay
taxes
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mrs.
beale,
one
more
question.
for
all
practical
purposes
insofar
as
the
owner
of
this
land
is
concerned.
if
you
succeed
here
and
use
this
corner
of
his
land,
what
is
the
difference
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
and
his
rights
by
taking
it
this
way
or
taking
it
by
eminent
domain
outside
the
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
take
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
you
take
the
road
up
and
move
it?
