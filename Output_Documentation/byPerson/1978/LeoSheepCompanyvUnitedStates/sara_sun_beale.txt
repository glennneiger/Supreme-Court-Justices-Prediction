ms.

beale
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
congress
made
the
railroad
land
grants
that
reserved
a
total
of
approximately
100
million
acres
of
public
lands
that
were
interspersed,
checkerboard
fashion
with
the
lands
that
it
had
granted
to
the
railroads.
the
railroad
received
the
odd-numbered
sections
that
completely
surrounded
each
of
the
retained
public
sections.
it's
not
possible
to
either
enter
or
leave
any
of
the
retained
public
sections
without
passing
over
some
portions
of
the
lands
that
were
granted
to
the
railroads.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
congress
reserved
a
legal
and
forcible
right
to
enter
and
leave
those
100
million
acres
of
public
lands.
we
submit
that
congress'
intent
to
reserve
a
right
of
access
was
manifest
in
the
pattern
and
in
the
plan
of
the
railroad
grants.
in
the
same
way,
as
a
private
grant
towards
intention
to
reserve
a
right
of
access
to
lands
that
he
retains
when
he
makes
a
grant
maybe
implicit
or
manifest
in
the
pattern
of
the
grants.
it
was
settled
that
common
law
that
where
a
private
grantor
conveys
away
lands
that
completely
surround
another
portion
of
lands
that
he
retains.
he
is
presumed
or
assumed
to
have
reserved
some
right
of
access
so
that
he
can
enter
and
leave
that
lands
that
he
retained
in
order
to
make
use
of
them.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
that's
certainly
true
and
one
of
the
suggestions
that
the
petitioners
have
made
here
is
that
perhaps
congress
intended
to
first
grant
out
these
100
million
acres
of
land
and
then
use
the
power
of
eminent
domain
in
order
to
secure
access
to
issued
these
checkerboard
sections
one
by
one.
and
we've
suggested
in
our
brief
that
it
is
inconceivable
that
congress
could
have
purposely
intended
to
set
up
a
pattern
or
a
mechanism
that
would
be
--
that
cumbersome
and
unworkable.
it
would
have
completely
overpowered
the
state
territorial
and
federal
courts
to
have
set
up
that
kind
of
mechanism.
and
moreover,
we
can
see
from
the
history
of
the
use
of
these
grants
that
the
federal
government
did
not
turnaround
after
making
the
grant
and
begin
a
concerted
pattern
of
condemnation
on
these
rights
of
way.
so
we
think
not
only
was
that
an
unworkable
way
of
gaining
access
to
these
lands
but
we
find
no
evidence
that
that
is
what
congress
either
did
intend
in
the
legislative
history
and
no
evidence
that
that
in
fact
is
what
occurred
after
the
land
grants
were
made.
so
although,
it
is
true
that
congress
does
that
united
states
retained
the
right
to
use
the
power
of
eminent
domain
were
necessary.
we
think
that
that
really
does
not
provide
the
key
to
interpreting
what
congress
intent
was
when
it
made
that
checkerboard
pattern
of
land
grants.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
think
that
that
may
provide
some
kind
of
basis
for
interpreting
what
congress'
intent
is?
of
course
the
general
cases,
teaching
how
to
interpret
the
acts
applies.
we
would
look
to
the
legislative
intent.
we
would
look
to
the
administrative
construction.
and
we
might
also
look
to
the
context
in
which
the
grants
were
made,
the
historical
context.
and
we
might
also
look
to
the
--
in
doing
now,
we
might
look
to
the
common
law
basis
for
land
grants
to
see
how
one
might
interpret
the
intent
of
congress.
so
i
think
all
of
those
would
provide
a
guide.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
one
can
try
the
things
--
i
should
make
our
point
here.
we
are
not
claiming
that
there
was
a
common
law
easement
of
necessity
created
when
congress
made
these
grants.
what
we
are
saying
and
this
goes
back
to
my
prior
answer
you
is
that
the
assumption
that
underlies
the
common
law
rule
about
easements
of
necessity
and
that
also
plays
a
part
in
other
kinds
of
implied
easements
about
attempting
to
construe
the
intent
of
the
parties.
and
about
what
the
grantor's
intent
must
have
been
in
this
kind
of
circumstance
is
the
guide
here.
so
we
are
not
claiming
a
common
law
easement
by
necessity.
what
we
are
seeking
to
do
is
to
ascertain
the
intent
of
congress
by
looking
to
rules
about
common
law
easements
by
necessity
and
there
are
broader
rules
about
easements
by
implications,
so
there
are
some
differences.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
of
reserved
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that's
exactly
right.
a
reserved
easement
and
implied
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
one
could
certainly
make
that
argument
and
some
of
the
state
courts
have
certainly
suggested
that
under
state
law,
no
easement
by
necessity
can
be
--
yes,
sir.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that's
correct.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
and
we
are
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--
using
that
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
we
believe
that
this
is
primarily
a
question
of
legislative
construction.
what
we
think
in
trying
to
interpret
what
it
was
that
congress
was
doing
that
not
only
may
congress
intent
be
judged
by
what
its
assumptions
were
about
property
law
but
also
that
there
is
an
underlying
logic
to
the
common
law
dealing
with
easements
by
necessity
which
is
that
a
grantor
must
have
intended
to
reserve
a
right
to
make
use
of
the
property
that
he
retained
that
that's
manifest
in
the
pattern
of
his
grant.
and
that
is
what
we
really
rely
upon
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
we
think
not.
and
again,
by
looking
to
the
circumstances
of
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
that's
not
quite
true
in
the
sense
that
for
many,
many
years
of
--
before
the
land
grants
were
made
the
federal
government
had
developed
a
well-established
policy
of
allowing
locations
of
roadways,
all
across
the
public
domain.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
now,
that
was
not
established
by
statute
until
1866.
but
this
court
has
clearly
in
the
alameda
county
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
interpreted
that
1866
act
as
con
--
as
a
recognition
of
a
preexisting
right
that
was
broader
then,
really.
anything
that
would
be
needed
to
gain
access
to
the
checkerboard
land
grants,
any
is
different
in
kind
from
simple
right
of
access
back
and
forth
from
one
checker
to
another.
so
we
think
that
the
context
of
the
most
logical
assumption
is
that
congress
knew
that
it
had
a
policy
of
allowing
runways
to
be
located
across
the
public
domain.
otherwise,
they
never
could
have
been
settled
anywhere.
and
that
provides
one
part
of
the
context
with
this
act
but
the
other
part
of
the
context
is
that
when
it
left
a
100
million
acres
land
lot
in
a
checkerboard
fashion
that
it
must
have
been
intended
to
reserve
a
legal
right
to
get
in
and
out,
ingress
and
egress
for
those
sections.
not
a
right
dependent
upon
the
fact
that
no
one
would
challenge
them.
it
didn't
intend
that
all
federal
officers,
agents
and
grantee
should
be
trespassers
who
could
be
thrown
off.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
yes.
the
patents
were
taken
subject
to
the
runways
that
were
established?
ms.
sara
sun
beale
now,
i
think
there's
a
good
body
of
case
law
to
that
effect
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
you
mean,
if
no
roadway
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--
had
ever
been
established?
ms.
sara
sun
beale
no.
the
custom
that
was
established
pursuant
or
that
was
recognized
in
that
statute
would
not
have
affected
those.
they
would
be
like
any
other
private
property
and
presumably
one
would
go
to
--
through
another
area
if
the
owner
at
that
point
took
his
land
and
had
built
an
improvement
or
whatever.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
certainly
the
power
of
eminent
domain
had
been
used
of
variety
of
different
methods
were
used
to
locate
these
roads.
pursuant
to
the
statute
that
i
just
described,
the
state
followed
varying
methods.
one
of
the
states
at
least
and
perhaps
others
passed
the
statute
that
dedicated
all
of
the
section
lines
as
public
roads,
so
that
as
settlers
came
in,
those
were
recognized
as
public
roads.
other
states
relied
more
upon
prescription
in
some
place
counties,
territorial
governments,
set
up
roads
in
--
and
a
variety
of
methods
were
used
to
locate
those
roads.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
yes.
and
we
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well
--
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
be
clear
on
when
we're
saying
these
areas.
i
mean
the
areas
where
the
checkerboard
grants
were
located.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
and
that
would
include
both
the
land
granted
to
the
railroads
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--
as
well
as
to
the
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--
to
the
--
the
public
and
i
guess
what
i
--
my
clearest
answer
would
be
that
the
record
here
is
not
precise
as
to
what
was
done
in
each
locality.
and
as
to
who
owned
the
land
when
a
particular
road
was
located
either
on
land
granted
to
the
railroad,
land
granted
to
the
united
states,
there
were
some
grant
to
a
private
party.
whether
the
land
was
owned
by
the
federal
government
and
the
county
decided
more
than
an
easement,
decided
more
to
look
than
to
locate
a
road.
in
any
event,
the
current
authority
for
locating
easements
or
whatever
cost
fairly
and
just
as
we've
mention
to
the
1976
statute
adopted
by
congress'
party
to
federal
land
policy
in
management
act.
and
if
a
private
owner
of
a
railroad
land
that
was
originally
patented
to
the
railroad
needed
to
locate
an
easement
to
get
in
and
out
of
his
checker.
now,
that's
not
the
case
here
because
of
course
the
leo
sheep
company
and
palm
livestock
company
have
tailored
grazing
it
permit
and
they
do
not
require
--
there
having
a
problem
of
access.
but
if
they
did,
they
could
apply
to
the
secretary
of
interior
and
get
an
easement
in
and
out,
if
need
be.
so
there
is
a
mechanism
and
the
particular
statute
passing
1866
is
no
longer
enforced.
but
--
but
there
is
a
mechanism
and
i
would
emphasize
to
the
court
that
we
did
not
go
into
in
great
length
the
reasons
why
believe
that
no
reciprocal
easement
was
created
across
the
federal
lands
for
one
reason
because
it
is
so
clear
that
in
this
particular
case,
no
such
easement
was
required
or
claimed.
and
indeed
we
think
that
that
was
as
it
--
this
is
a
general
matter
quite
true
that
the
federal
statutory
provisions,
the
policies,
the
new
provision
are
quite
adequate
and
have
been
quite
adequate
to
ensure
that
the
grantee
over
the
railroad
have
had
access,
and
that's
really
not
a
problem.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
certainly
now
there're
many
roadways.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
some
of
the
early
cases
which
do
in
fact
recognize
the
theory
that
we
put
forth
here
that
there
is
an
implied
reservation
so
that
there
--
the
grantees
of
the
united
states
and
federal
agents
and
so
forth
can
go
in
and
out.
that's
another
answer
to
why
this
wasn't
a
problem.
and
we
should
emphasize
that
the
right
that
we
claim
here
is
in
essence
only
when
to
have
important
applications
in
areas
like
this.
where
--
where
there
are
not
a
pattern
of
roadways
already
built
up.
we
claim
only
the
necessary
access
in
and
out,
ingress
and
egress
and
in
developed
areas,
that's
simply
not
a
problem.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
for
governmental
purposes
which
would
include
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
certainly
would
include
that
and
it
would
also
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
--
yes,
it
is.
it
is
a
one
lane
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
--
perhaps,
it
is
not
absence
that
it's
limited
to
the
use
of
federal
officers
and
agents.
but
it's
a
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--
federally
built
--
that's
correct.
it's
a
federally
constructed
reservoir
and
it's
a
federally
used
in
that
sense.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that's
correct.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that's
correct.
it's
a
one
lane
to
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that's
correct,
in
that
sense.
so
i
would
emphasize
as
i
say
that
the
right
that
we
claim
here
is
a
narrow
one
that
we
find
to
be
implicit
in
the
pattern
of
the
grants
and
not
a
common
law
easement
by
necessity.
and
we
think
really
the
burden
of
the
petitioner's
argument
is
to
establish
that
there
is
another
reasonable
alternative.
congress
must
have
intended
that
there
could
be
used
made
of
these
retained
100
million
acres.
and
the
question
is
really
whether
there
is
any
reasonable
alternative
to
the
construction
that
we've
put
for
it.
i've
already
suggested
that
we
find
--
that
we
believe
the
use
of
eminent
domain
to
secure
a
right
of
access
to
each
of
these
sections.
would've
been
totally
unworkable
and
moreover,
there's
no
suggestion
and
its
clear
from
the
history
that
that
method
was
not
used.
and
we
think
likewise
the
suggestion
that
congress
provided
only
that
the
settlers
should
work
it
out
among
themselves
that
perhaps
stay
in
local
laws
if
eminent
domain
would
be
used.
that
perhaps
people
would
not
object
to
the
passage
of
government
settlers
and
so
forth
is
really
not
one
that
can
be
implied
as
what
congress
intended.
the
grants
here
were
made
to
several
large
railroad
corporations
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--
and.
yes,
sir.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
we
think
the
principle
that
would
be
applied
here
is
the
general
property
law
principle
that
applies
to
other
kinds
of
easements
by
implication
where
there
is
no
instrument
that
fixes
the
location
and
the
general
rule
which
we
think
is
applicable
here.
is
that
they
must
be
located
in
a
manner
that
provides
a
minimal
intrusion
on
the
land
that
the
easement
crosses.
we
think
in
many
cases
asked
here,
the
location
would
be
across
the
corner.
in
the
first
instance,
there
would
be
an
attempt
to
reach
agreement
between
the
two
parties,
the
government
or
the
government's
grantee
and
the
grantee
of
the
railroad.
and
if
that
were
not
possible,
which
was
the
case
here,
the
government
or
its
grantee
would
have
a
choice
of
locating
the
easement
where
it
was
least
intrusive.
so
that
in
this
case
it
was
almost
precisely
on
the
corners
except
in
one
case
there
was
a
gate
of
some
sort,
a
little
down
from
the
corner.
and
the
government
used
that
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
certainly
it
would
be
subject
to
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--
either
judicial
proceedings
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--
to
determine
whether
the
government's
choice
was
reasonable.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
but
in
the
first
instance,
the
government
would
need
to
try
to
satisfy
the
grantor,
and
if
the
grantor
would
not
--
of
the
railroad.
if
the
grantor
of
the
railroad
would
not
agree
and
would
not
say
where
he
wanted
it
and
the
government
would
have
to
try
and
determine
what
would
be
reasonable.
and
i
suppose
either
in
this
case
--
either
of
two
methods
could
be
used.
in
this
case,
we
located
it
where
we
felt
it
certainly
was
the
least
intrusive
spot
and
the
grantor
brought
an
action
against
us,
the
railroad's
grantor.
i
suppose
we
could
also
perhaps
bring
a
suit
to
determine
a
declaratory
judgment
where
it
should
be
located.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
in
this
particular
case
for
example.
it's
a
dirt
road,
i
suppose
if
the
owner
needed
to
have
it
moved
that

there
might
be
some
negotiation.
ms.
sara

all
we
have
is
the
right
of
access.
ms.
sara

beale
well
--
ms.
sara

beale
i
think
its
cattle
in
this
case
despite
the
name
of
the
company
but
--
ms.
sara

beale
right,
right.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that's
right.
in
the
sense
that
he
couldn't
stop
the
public
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
think
less
the
value
of
the
easement.
his
taxes
would
be
reduced
in
the
sense
that
his
property
would
be
valued
by
--
would
be
less
than
the
value
of
the
--
you
know,
subtract
the
value
of
the
easement.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i'm
not
certain
with
the
most
usual
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
think
its
equally
in
the
case
of
--
lets
go
get
to
our
paradigm
case
of
the
private
grantor
who
would
perhaps
make
a
grant
of
this
same
size,
a
piece
of
property
to
adjacent
pieces,
a
need
to
reserve
a
right
of
access.
in
some
case
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
pardon
me?
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
if
you
imagine
the
donut
shape
which
is
always
the
law
book
example
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--
the
grantor
reserves
the
little
piece
of
the
donut
in
the
center.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
and
we
refer
to
his
having
reserved
an
easement
even
though,
it
maybe
necessary
in
some
case
to
have
a
dirt
road
such
as
this.
he
may
have
--
he
may
subdivide
that
and
put
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i'm
sorry?
ms.
sara
sun
beale
the
easement
belongs
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
it's
for
the
uses
that
he
can
offer
it
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that's
--
well,
that's
right
and
i
guess
i
would
say
that
are
used
(inaudible)
include
the
visitors
to
our
reservoir.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
think
that
the
best
answer
to
that
is,
if
there
is
a
system
of
public
loads
--
roads
later
located
in
this
area
our
right
of
access
would
no
longer
be
enforceable.
in
other
words,
if
we
can
get
in
and
out
of
our
lands
otherwise
as
soon
as
an
area
becomes
built
up
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--
we
no
longer
have
a
right
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
in
this
case
and
perhaps
this
is
the
easiest
example
of
all.
all
we
did
was
come
in
and
blade-off
the
grass
to
provide
a
track
to
go
in
and
out.
now
in
other
cases
perhaps
it
would
be
necessary
for
us
to
put
on
gravel
or
whatever
and
then
take
it
up
if
we
no
longer
needed
that
for
right
of
access.
but
the
--
and
this
goes
back
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
making
also
that
the
railroad
grantee
does
retain
the
title
to
that
land.
and
if
are
easement
or
right
of
access
or
way
of
access
in
and
out
is
no
longer
necessary
for
us
to
use
then
we
no
longer
have
a
right.
we
no
longer
have
enforceable
right
and
that
is
an
important
difference
than
what
would
happen
in
the
case
of
eminent
domain
where
we
would
take
full
permanent
title
to
that
land.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
mr.
martz
may
have
some
comment
on
this.
it's
my
understanding,
very
often
we
acquire
only
in
easement.
now,
that
may
not
be
the
case
in
the
case
of
a
eight-lane
superhighway.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
perhaps
when
the
project
is
so
large,
a
fee
title
is
taken
but
in
many
cases
only
an
easement
is
taken.
and
i'm
not
certain
where
the
dividing
line
is.
there
maybe
discretion.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
no,
sir.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
we
believe
that
all
that
was
implicitly
reserved
here
is
a
reasonable
right
of
ingress
and
egress
to
make
use
of
these
properties.
now,
we
--
certainly
the
problem
is
more
difficult
here
than
if
the
grants
had
spelled
out
by
metes
and
bounds
or
whatever,
what
that
would
entail?
but
there's
a
whole
body
of
common
law
which
has
developed
in
terms
of
or
to
meet
the
problem
of
trying
to
define
what
is
reserved
when
there's
an
implied
easement.
and
we
think
that
that
body
of
law
would
be
looked
to
here
to
determine
the
extent.
and
in
essence,
what
we're
saying
is
what
congress
could
have
reasonably
foreseen
as
a
need
to
get
in
and
out
to
make
use
of
those
sections
would
govern.
certainly
what
we
have
here
i
think
is
within
what
congress
would
have
intended.
congress
believed
that
these
sections
as
mr.
martz
described
yesterday
would
in
fact
that
retained
government
sections
would
be
subject
to
homesteading
and
development.
congress
thought
that
putting
the
railroads
out
to
the
west
would
bring
people
from
the
east,
allow
them
to
settle
and
develop
that
land.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
only
in
the
sense
of
what
congress
could
have
comprehended
and
congress
did
clearly
comprehend
development
of
those
sections.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
if
something
perhaps
like
the
process
that
the
court
goes
through
in
the
case
of
implied
water
reservations
where
the
notion
is
that
at
the
time
the
conveyance
for
the
grantor
whatever
was
made
or
the
reservation
was
made.
what
congress
foresaw
is
the
present
and
the
foreseeable
future
needs
is
the
guide.
and
that
is
the
same
guide
that's
used
in
the
case
of
a
private
grantor
and
we
would
say
clearly
the
roadway
here
is
within
that
contemplation.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i'm
--
it's
not
clear
to
me
why
there
would
be
any
difference.
we
do
think
that
the
right
that
congress
reserved
was
for
the
benefit
of
those
pieces
of
--
parcels
of
land
so
that
they
could
be
used.
in
an
instance,
the
benefit
would
be
conveyed
with
the
parcels
of
land.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
in
other
words,
we
do
no
good
if
we
only
had
the
right
to
use
it.
but
as
soon
as
we
conveyed
it
to
the
settlers
that
we
expect
to
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
no,
not
in
that
sense,
no.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
yes.
and
--
and
we
think
that
is
so
precisely
because
of
our
understanding
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
here
which
was
to
grant
the
odd-numbered
sections
to
the
railroads
to
encourage
them
to
build
this
rail
line,
keeping
these
retained
sections
knowing
that
there
would
be
enhancing
value
that
they
would
be
available
for
settlement
and
planning
to
sell
those
off
at
double
the
normal
price
recouping
the
investment
that
it
had
made
to
the
railroad
and
allowing
settlement
to
progress
out
west.
and
only
by
reserving
the
right
to
get
in
and
out
in
for
its
grantees
and
the
settlers
and
so
forth
to
have
a
right
to
grin
--
to
get
in
and
out
of
those
sections
could
that
plan
really
have
been
accomplished.
and
that's
the
problem
of
course
with
the
petitioners'
argument.
even
if
congress
has
assumed
that
in
many
cases
no
one
would
have
objected,
its
planned
for
the
development
of
the
rail
lines
and
the
settlement
of
these
sections
was
dependent
upon
a
right
of
these
settlers
to
get
in
and
make
use
of
this
land
that
would
not
be
subject
to
veto
power
in
essence
by
several
large
railroad
corporations
who
owned
the
sections
completely
surrounding
each
one
of
the
retained
public
sections.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that's
correct
and
we
believe
that
is
so
because
again,
look
in
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
because
when
the
railroads,
settlers,
grantees,
whatever
came
in.
they
had
the
right
under
the
1866
act
to
locate
their
roads
across
the
public
domain.
and
we
believe
that
was
the
mechanism
that
was
used.
now,
we
don't
disagree
for
moment
that
by
enlarge
most
of
these
problems
were
worked
out
by
agreement
among
the
parties
because
everyone
needed
to
get
in
and
out
but
in
the
sense
of
a
necessity
for
reserving
a
legal
right
of
access.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
under
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
in
essence
at
some
point,
one
gets
back
to
the
same
problem
that
it
took
place
under
the
homestead
acts
and
under
the
other
location
of
the
preemption
acts
and
so
forth
which
is
that
some
grantee
may
have
wanted
to
locate
a
road
across
someone
else's
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
yes.
i
said,
had
all
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
happened
at
one
cell
through
--
suddenly
without
any
location
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
we
believe
not
only
that
it
is
reasonable
that
the
plan
shows
that
and
that
what
has
happened
in
the
intervening
years
makes
that
clear
too.
there
--
virtually
no
instances
of
the
railroad
grantees
who
in
fact
had
the
problem
that
you
described.
the
1866
act
was
used
extensively.
the
title
v
provisions
are
used
now
and
the
problem
that
we
have
that
we
do
see
occasionally
cropping
up
is
the
railroads
and
their
grantees
blocking
access.
one
of
the
entrances
of
course
to
this
is
that
the
only
large
block
conveyance
was
to
the
railroads.
the
only
single
party
who
could
have
blocked
access
is
in
any
one
area
is
the
railroad
who
received
all
of
these
grants.
in
the
case
of
grants
of
--
to
small
party's
homestead
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
the
railroads
received
the
land
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
they
were
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
they
had
to
sell
or
dispose
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--
which
meant
--
and
there
was
no
requirement
that
the
railroad
lands
be
sold
off
to
small
landowners.
in
fact,
that
didn't
happen
in
many
areas.
the
government
lands
which
are
to
be
disposed
off
in
a
--
essentially
160-acre
parcels.
single
little
parties
scattered
all
over
the
west.
the
only
large
block
prints,
the
only
party
who
could've
frustrated
the
development
of
a
whole
area
was
the
railroad
who
received
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
that's
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
--
why
in
the
sense
that
the
--
and
it's
perhaps
maybe
a
little
more
complicated
than
that
in
the
sense
that
the
platte
case
recognized
that
all
the
railroads
had
to
do
was
to
make
some
use
of
this
land
to
finance
the
construction
of
the
railroads
within
a
certain
point
after
the
railroads
were
constructed.
they
were
able
to
and
they
did
in
many
cases
convey
largely
into
holdings
to
a
subsidiary
to
a
mortgagor
and
that
party
just
as
much
as
the
railroad
could
have
blocked
the
development
and
settlement
of
the
government
sections.
no
grantee
of
the
government
would
have
had
that
kind
of
power.
it
wasn't
possible
for
any
single
grantee
of
the
government
in
these
160-acre
parcels
to
frustrate
the
development
of
the
land
granted
to
the
railroad
and
it
didn't
happen.
and
i
would
emphasize
again
that
we
did
not
develop
all
of
the
reasons
in
our
briefs.
why
we
moved
--
we
--
that
there
is
no
retained
or
there
was
no
grant
of
an
easement
across
the
government
lands
because
that
question
is
not
in
the
case.
that
the
part
--
the
petitioners
here
have
the
taylor
grazing
act
permits
and
they
used
all
of
our
lands
whereas
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
yesterday,
what
we
want
to
do
is
use
a
corner
of
their
lands.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
unless
there
are
further
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
i
guess
that
i
would
say,
not
in
the
sense
that
in
most
cases
particularly
before
the
land
was
developed
to
any
great
extent.
the
obvious
reasonable
place
would
be
the
corner
and
there
would
be
no
point
to
the
private
grantee
of
the
railroad
going
to
court
to
challenge
that.
he'd
get
nothing
out
of
it.
that
would
clearly
be
the
least
intrusive.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
well,
that
maybe
true
and
i
guess
our
point
is
really
that.
if
congress
had
thought
that
no
one
could
enter
these
sections
except
as
trespassers
until
it
went
out
section
by
section
and
determined.
did
it
have
to
bring
an
eminent
domain
proceeding
and
to
bring
those
in
cases
where
that
was
necessary?
that
would
be
substantially
more
difficult
process
than
what
we
suggest
happened
which
is
that
there
was
a
right
to
locate
upon
what
appeared
to
be
or
to
cross
--
what
appeared
to
be
at
the
reasonable
and
least
intrusive
spot.
and
if
it
--if
a
dispute
developed,
then
the
parties
would
try
and
work
it
out.
and
if
not,
the
landowner
could
go
to
court
and
say,
"wait
a
minute,
you
should
use
my
gate
down
here
and
not
go
across
the
corner",
or
"wait
a
minute,
i
want
to
locate
a
house
on
the
corner
and
you
should
go
further
down",
and
that
is
different.
if
only
those
disputed
cases
are
subject
to
litigation,
we
would
think.
thank
you.
