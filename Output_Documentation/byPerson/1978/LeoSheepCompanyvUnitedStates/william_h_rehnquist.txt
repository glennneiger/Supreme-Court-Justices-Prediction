wasn't
greenville
dodge
who
is

justice
william

rehnquist
well,
mr.
martz,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
the
homestead
act
of
1862
authorized
only
a
160-acre
homesteads?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
correct
in
this.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
--
was
it
the
desert
land
act
in
1877
or
the
farmer's
stock
or
like
1960
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
it
finally
went
to
640?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
any
rate,
at
the
time
of
these
railroad
grants,
the
homestead
was
a
160
and
not
640?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
had
passed
at
the
same
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
camfield
was
base
on
act
of
congress
so
specified,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
beale,
i
suppose
it's
well-established
that
the
question
of
the
construction
of
a
federal
grant
is
a
federal
question
but
what
body
of
law
does
one
turn
to
in
deciding
that
federal
question.
is
it
a
general
common
law
of
real
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
see
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
see
any
difference
in
the
common
law
between
an
implied
easement
and
easement
of
necessity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
miss
beale,
to
go
back
to
the
alameda
county
and
the
custom
that
was
established,
would
the
roads
established
person
that
customer
that
drives
survive
a
patent
of
the
government
sections
to
a
landowner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
roadways
that
weren't
actually
established?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
the
time
of
the
patent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
miss
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
beale,
i
do
have
one
further
question.
your
answers
to
the
questions
posed
by
some
of
my
colleagues
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bench
indicate
that
the
parties
would
be
entitled
to
litigate
in
court
over
the
reasonableness
of
the
government
--
of
the
easement
which
the
government
designated
across
the
property.
doesn't
that
undercut
to
a
certain
extent
your
original
argument
that
congress
couldn't
have
intended
a
system
whereby
congress
had
to
go
--
the
government
had
to
go
and
then
condemn
this
by
eminent
domain
because
the
courts
just
couldn't
have
handled
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
doing
eminent
domain
to
though,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
the
intent
--
many
eminent
domain
cases,
the
private
owner
welcomes
the
government
putting
in
a
road
and
that
simply
agrees
not
to
seek
any
condemnation
not
--
the
expenses
or
value
in
exchange
for
the
value
to
him
of
the
road?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
federal
appeals
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
largest
portion
of
the
rocky
mountain
states.
the
petitioner
in
this
court,
leo
sheep
company,
sued
the
united
states
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
wyoming
because
the
united
states
claimed
an
easement
over
land
originally
granted
to
the
union
pacific
company
and
now
the
property
of
leo
sheep.
both
land
lies
in
the
vicinity
of
a
reservoir
area
in
wyoming
use
by
the
public
for
fishing
and
hunting
and
the
government
claimed
an
easement
over
a
small
part
of
the
leo
sheep
company's
lands
in
order
to
provide
road
access
for
the
public
to
the
reservoir.
the
union
pacific
act
of
1862
granted
public
lands
to
the
union
pacific
railroad
for
each
mile
of
track
that
it
laid
in
the
construction
of
the
first
transcontinental
railroad.
the
grants
were
made
under
a
system
whereby
land
surrounding
the
railroad
right-of-way
were
divided
into
checkerboard
blocks
with
odd-numbered
lots
being
granted
to
the
railroad
and
even-numbered
lots
being
reserved
to
the
government.
because
of
this
method
of
land
grants,
it
is
not
possible
for
the
public
to
reach
the
reservoir
without
some
intrusion
on
the
land
of
leo
sheep
company.
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
government
could
acquire
its
easement
only
by
a
process
of
condemnation,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
this
decision
by
a
divided
vote.
it
held
that
the
government
did
not
have
to
compensate
leo
sheep
company
for
the
use
of
its
land
as
a
public
road.
we
now
in
turn
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
in
an
opinion
which
may
strike
some
as
a
judicial
counterpart
to
of
the
west
was
one.
we
described
the
history
of
the
construction
of
the
first
transcontinental
railroad
in
this
country
and
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
decided
the
legal
effects
of
the
various
government
land
grants
which
accompanied
the
building
of
this
--
the
railroad.
generations
of
land
patents
have
issued
without
any
express
reference
to
rights
now
claimed
by
the
government
and
this
court
as
well
as
other
courts
had
traditionally
recognized
that
special
need
for
certainty
and
predictability
where
land
titles
are
concerned.
we
are
unwilling
to
accept
the
government's
invitation
to
upset
settled
expectations
to
accommodate
some
ill-defined
power
to
construct
public
thoroughfares
through
private
property
without
compensation.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
accordingly
reversed.
mr.
justice
white
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
