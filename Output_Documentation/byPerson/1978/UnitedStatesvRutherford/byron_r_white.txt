r.
white
and
they
have
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
has
presented
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
true
if
taken
orally?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
can't
say
then
that
it's
not
toxic?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can't
say
that
it
is
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
circuit's
order
is
limited
to
intravenous?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
just
an
administrative.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
what
forward
just
on
the
administrative
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
mean
as
it
finally
got
to
--
finally
before
judge

it
--
he
proceeded
on
the
administrative
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
new
evidence
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
heroin?
justice

r.
white
and
you
would
say
that
same
thing
as
--
about
heroin
or
cocaine?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
you
are
saying
it
about
oral
--
about
laetrile
taken
orally.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i
thought
my
brother
rehnquist
asked
you
about
--
wouldn't
you
take
the
same
position
with
respect
to
laetrile
taken
orally?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yet
the
court
didn't
decide
that
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
would
take
the
position
with
respect
to
the
oral
ingestion
as
laetrile
but
not
heroin,
even
though
it's
a
terminally
ill
cancer
patient
who
wants
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suggest
you
stay
with
microphone,
sir.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
answer
questions.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
--
this
wasn't
your
position
in
the
tenth
circuit?
