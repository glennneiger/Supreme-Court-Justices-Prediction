mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
initially
it
is
incumbent
upon
me
to
discuss
with
you
briefly
the
limitations
that
are
imposed
inherently
in
this
case
by
the
lower
court's
rulings.
this
case
applies
only
to
a
class
of
terminally
ill
cancers
patients
which
are
represented
in
this
case
by
mr.
glen
rutherford.
it
applies
only
to
the
application
of
the
substance
known
as
laetrile.
it
applies
to
the
intravenous
application
of
that
particular
substance,
and
it
applies
to
application
of
that
substance
only
under
the
care
of
--
excuse
me,
by
supervising
doctor.
this
case
has
nothing
at
all
--
no
content
other
than
that
what
i've
just
discussed.
now,
the
reason
i
mentioned
that
is
because
it
has
been
asserted
in
the
government's
brief
to
a
large
extent
that
this
case
bowe
(ph)
is
very
ill
for
the
food
and
drug
administration,
and
i
just
do
not
believe
that
is
the
case
and
i
do
not
believe
this
case
when
you
consider
what
is
happening.
initially,
this
case
was
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
by
several
cancer
patients
who
were
desirous
of
using
laetrile
were
in
the
terminal
state,
and
almost
immediately
died.
mr.
rutherford
was
brought
in
as
a
replacement
or
supplemental
plaintiff
and
at
that
point
in
time,
we
move
the
court
for
temporary
injunction
so
that
he
wouldn't
suffer
the
same
fate
as
the
original
plaintiffs.
the
district
court
granted
the
injunction
just
as
to
mr.
rutherford
which
decision
of
course
was
appealed
to
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
that
circuit
made
a
determination
that
in
fact
mr.
rutherford
was
entitled
to
the
temporary
injunction,
but
it
did
not
appear
to
that
court
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
had
the
sufficient
record
upon
which
to
base
its
new
drug
determination.
so,
the
case
was
remanded
back
to
the
district
court
and
a
hearing
was
held
before
that
district
court.
at
that
point
in
time
judge
bohanon
asked
the
attorneys
for
the
food
and
drug
administration
what
administrative
record
had
been
compiled
to
determine
that
laetrile
was
a
new
drug
or
that
it
was
not
grandfathered
by
provisions
of
the
62
amendments
or
the
38
amendments.
the
government
attorney
stipulated
in
court
at
that
time
that's
a
matter
of
record
that
they
had
no
record
exclusive
of
one
affidavit
which
had
been
prepared
by
a
food
and
drug
administration
medical
doctor.
judge
bohanon
then
remanded
the
case
to
the
food
and
drug
administration
so
that
the
proper
administrative
record
could
be
compiled
upon
which
he
can
base
some
decision
and
the
tenth
circuit
could
base
some
decision
as
to
authenticity
of
the
administrator's
findings.
the
food
and
drug
administration
then
held
its
rule
making
proceeding,
and
we've
contended
throughout
this
litigation
that
the
rulemaking
proceeding
that
the
fda
conducted
was
not
proper
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
no,
your
honor.
it
was
a
complaint
filed
in
the
unites
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
on
behalf
of
terminally
ill
cancer
patients
alleging
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
by
virtue
of
the
determination
that
laetrile
was
a
new
drug,
had
effectively
prohibited
their
use
of
the
drug,
and
there
is
authority
for
that
i
believe
that's
weinberger
versus
hynson,
westcott
&
dunning,
that
after
the
food
and
drug
administration
had
made
its
initial
determination
that
a
district
court
made
them
review.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
well,
yes
your
honor,
i
guess
you
had
to
call
that.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
your
honor,
it's
been
backwards
and
forwards
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
no
new
evidence
was
heard.
the
administrative
record
that
was
compiled
which
is
ordered
by
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
ordered
to
comply
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
section
554
sub
(c).
within
that
subsection,
it
requires
that
cross-examination
be
allowed
to
the
proponents
and
to
the
other
side
in
the
case.
now,
the
food
and
drug
administration
selected
the
most
informal
proceeding
of
the
variety
of
proceedings
it
could
possibly
hold,
and
in
fact
allowed
witnesses
to
testify
without
the
administration
oath,
or
without
the
opportunity
of
cross-examination
to
determine
the
veracity
of
any
of
those
witnesses.
now,
that
was
so
even
though
the
objection
was
made
to
the
hearing
examiner
at
that
time
to
that
particular
type
of
proceeding.
the
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
no,
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
required
that
the
fda
conduct
the
proceedings
pursuant
to
554
sub
(c)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
actually,
sir
that
refers
you
to
556
which
grants
the
right
of
cross-examination.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
by
that
and
as
it
was
espoused
by
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
the
fda
also
has
proceedings
in
which
generally
speaking
when
a
court
sends
a
case
to
it
for
review
and
generally
speaking,
those
requirements
are
for
a
more
formal
type
of
hearings.
that's
an
addition
to
the
requirements
of
the
tenth
circuit.
that
was
not
amended
in
this
case.
now,
the
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
no,
it's
part
of
the
regulations
for
the
food
and
drug
act,
i
believe
it's
section
1060
or
1080
of
their
procedure,
left
side
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
at
any
rate,
the
fda
did
hold
its
proceedings
and
the
commissioner
did
issue
findings
just
as
the
solicitor
general
advised
the
court.
this
was
then
appealed
to
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma.
judge
bohanon
examined
the
entire
administrative
record,
and
based
upon
his
review
of
that
record
made
the
determination
that
the
entire
proceedings
were
arbitrary
capricious
and
abused
of
discretion
and
not
in
accordance
with
the
law.
he
based
it
upon
several
things.
first,
he
made
the
determination
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
by
virtue
of
a
notice
published
in
the
federal
register
espoused
the
same
continuing
view
toward
laetrile
as
it
had
been
espousing
for
many
years
since
the
1950's,
same
entrenched
position.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
exactly
the
point
the
judge
was
making.
the
fda
has
made
its
decision,
has
made
its
decision
backed
in
1950
before
it
had
any
administrative
record
whatsoever
and
continues
to
make
the
same.
he
used
that
particular
item
to
show
that
there
was
a
lack
of
in
depth
fact-finding
in
the
administrative
proceedings.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
i
believe
that
what
the
court
is
trying
to
make,
your
honor.
the
court
decided
as
i
have
just
previously
said
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
commissioner's
decision
should
be
set
aside.
that
was
set
aside.
it
was
set
aside
on
two
bases.
first
of
all,
it
was
set
aside
on
the
basis
that
laetrile
is
subject
to
an
exemption
by
virtue
of
the
1962
grandfather
provisions
of
the
act.
he
also
made
the
determination
that
it
would
not
--
that
should
be
set
aside
based
upon
the
fact
that
a
new
violation
of
the
right
to
privacy
guaranteed
with
the
ninth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
your
honor,
there
was
substantial
evidence
on
use
prior
to
1962.
the
evidence
of
use
prior
to
1962
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
the
requirement
is
commercial
use
prior
to
1962,
your
honor.
the
court
cited
and
i
believe
its
footnote
22,
affidavits
by
chauncey
lick
and
several
other
individuals
as
to
commercial
use
prior
to
1962.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
at
any
rate
your
honor,
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
used
prior
to
1962
that
was
used
commercially.
the
district
court
found
that
the
labeling
was
the
same
for
all
practical
purposes
as
it
was
before
that
date.
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
not
--
that
it
was
safe
and
that
it
was
nontoxic.
now,
that
going
into
great
detail
on
each
and
every
one
of
those
because
the
district
court's
opinion
sets
it
out
in
great
detail
and
i've
briefed
it
in
my
brief
and
the
government's
brief
did
theirs.
the
case
law
establishes
that
if
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
upon
among
experts,
for
instance
such
as
--
as
to
safety,
and
this
applies
across
the
board
i
believe
to
the
1962
grandfather
exemption.
that
that
is
a
fact
question
to
be
determine
by
the
trial
of
fact.
in
this
case,
judge
bohanon
was
seating
as
both
the
trier
of
law
and
the
trierl
of
fact.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
the
facts
he
had
before
him
were
the
facts
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
that's
all
he
had.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
your
honor,
in
this
case,
i
do
mean
testimony
and
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
your
honor,
there
is
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
that
he
threw
out
the
findings
and
superimposed
his
own.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
he
did.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
the
authority
for
that
are
the
cases
which
i've
cited
under
that
particular
proposition
on
our
brief.
first
of
all
your
honor,
if
i
may
address
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
well
your
honor,
he
didn't
find
anything
in
the
record,
in
the
record
that
the
law
did
not
apply
to
terminally
ill
patients
because
that
would
have
been
(voice
overlap)
on
his
part.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
he
determined
--
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it
was
the
tenth
circuit
that
actually
made
determination
of
such
your
honor.
the
tenth
circuit
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
i
think
they
found
that
based
along
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
your
honor,
i
know
in
my
own
mind.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
alright,
i
think
your
honor
that
the
tenth
circuit
found
that
the
act
did
not
apply
to
terminally
ill
cancer
patients
because
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
apply
the
term
efficacy
to
a
terminally
ill
cancer
patient.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
your
honor,
many
of
the
drugs
that
are
used
on
terminally
ill
cancer
patients
do
in
fact
have
pain
killing
effects
and
generally
speaking
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
it
is
the
duty
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
fulfill
its
congressional
mandate,
and
it
is
our
position
before
the
court
that
the
congressional
mandate
which
added
efficacy
in
particular
to
the
food
and
drug
act
which
came
out
after
the
thalidomide
tragedies
does
not
have
application
to
terminally
ill
cancer
patients.
and
the
reasoning
behind
that
is
very
simply
that
if
in
fact
there
were
an
effective
cancer
remedy,
then
you
wouldn't
have
terminal
cancer
patients,
they're
be
terminal
from
some
other
cause
entirely.
and
as
long
as
you
do
not
have
an
effective
cancer
remedy,
that
to
require
that
of
laetrile
is
an
absurd
result
from
the
act.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
i
certainly
do
not
disagree
with
that.
i
have
no
problem
with
that
whatsoever
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
the
tenth
circuit
ruled
strictly
relative
to
laetrile
intravenous
form.
i
do
not
know
what
the
court
will
do
in
some
other
context.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
my
position
as
it
always
has
been
is
that
we
have
terminal
cancer
patients
desiring
to
use
laetrile.
this
case
is
brought
that
particular
issue
before
the
court.
my
position
is
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
use
it.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
that
it
does
not
apply
to
terminally
ill
cancer
patients
designed
to
use
laetrile
under
their
physician's
care.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
your
honor,
the
statute
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
oh,
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
no.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
it
is
my
--
no,
i
do
not
have
a
heroin
or
cocaine
case,
your
honor,
so
i
would
not
discuss
that
at
all.
i
do
understand
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
no,
we're
just
discussing
the
intravenous
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
i
would
take
the
same
position.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
decide
that.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
it
is
my
understanding
totally
outside
of
anything
i
know
from
this
case
that
in
england,
heroin
and
some
other
opiates
are
being
used
for
terminally
ill
cancer
patients
and
the
reason
it's
being
used
is
because
they
determine
that
there's
nothing
that
can
be
done
to
help
them
and
it
will
take
them
off
some
of
the
really
mind-deadening
drugs.
so,
to
that
extent
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
i
would
like
to
address
if
i
may
next
the
constitutional
aspect
in
this
particular
case.
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
found
that
to
deny
the
use
of
laetrile
to
terminally
ill
cancer
patients
violated
their
right
to
privacy.
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
rule
upon
this
issue
and
as
the
court
has
been
informed
neither
did
it
rule
upon
the
issue
of
the
grandfather
clause.
as
to
the
constitutional
issue,
the
argument,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
made
that
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
roe
versus
wade
and
likewise
in
doe
versus
bolton
both
abortion
cases
justified
the
extension
of
a
right
to
privacy
to
a
healthcare
context.
now,
as
we've
briefed,
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondents
that
the
intent
and
spirit
of
both
doe
versus
wade
and
roe
versus
bolton
established
that
they
are
in
healthcare
context.
for
instance,
the
health
of
the
mother
in
doe
versus
white
as
mentioned
over
and
over
again,
and
in
doe
versus
bolton,
justice
douglas
of
course,
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
concurring
opinion
enumerated
the
right
to
careful
one's
own
health
as
a
fundamental
right.
it
is
our
position
that
if
in
fact
the
right
to
healthcare
to
make
a
determination
as
to
the
care
of
one's
own
body
under
medical
supervision
is
a
fundamental
right
in
fact
then
the
petitioner
--
well,
the
respondents
in
this
case
plaintiffs
below
have
a
right
to
use
laetrile
under
the
court's
orders
and
within
the
court's
limitations
as
they
previously
been
enunciated.
now,
in
order
to
overcome
this,
the
food
and
drug
administration
must
establish
a
compelling
state
interest.
and
in
this
case,
that
compelling
state
interest
has
been
enunciated
as
more
of
a
desire
to
maintain
a
system
than
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
issues.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
your
honor,
i
have
only
argued
within
that
context
because
that
is
within
the
context
of
the
lower
court's
decision
and
outside
of
that,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
i
think
it's
somewhat
analogous
to
the
decision
in
roe
versus
white
in
which
this
court
made
the
determination
that
during
the
first
trimester
of
pregnancy,
because
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
produced
that
there
was
no
justification
for
a
compelling
state
interest,
and
therefore,
then
abortion
may
be
have
without
any
interest
to
the
state
at
all.
and
then
after
that
particular
point
in
time,
the
compelling
state
interest
came
into
play.
and
i
think
in
this
case,
it's
the
same
thing.
in
this
case,
if
you
have
a
patient
who
is
not
terminal,
who
is
not
been
diagnosed
as
such
by
his
doctor,
and
to
be
lead
away
from
possibly
useful
orthodox
therapy
to
laetrile
--
mr.
kenneth
ray

your
honor,
that
is
a
--
that
was
a
decision
rendered
by
the
tenth
circuit
that
they
have
to
have
medical
care.
i
personally
and
the
patients
in
this
case
are
of
the
opinion
that
they
should
be
subject
to
medical
care
because
they're
on
very
bad
condition,
they
need
continuing
supervision.
now
as
to
what
actual
legal
effect
that
has,
as
to
the
constitutional
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
as
a
matter
of
fact,
oklahoma
is
one
of
the
19
states
i
believe
that
has
now
legalizing
this
laetrile.
the
decision
of
the
district
court
is
relation
to
the
constitutional
issue
has
been
pretty
well
explained
up
to
this
point.
basically,
it
is
the
right
to
privacy
as
enunciated
roe
versus
wade,
doe
versus
bolton,
the
fact
that
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest
when
the
case
is
considered
in
the
terms
of
terminal
cancer
patients
who
have
been
declared
by
their
doctors
to
past
the
stage
where
they
going
through
death's
door.
in
their
application,
in
their
instance,
there's
no
possible
application
of
a
compelling
government
interest
that
could
have
an
effect.
as
to
people
who
have
not
been
designated
as
terminal
cancer
patients,
as
to
the
those
who
not
have
some
other
help
in
the
compelling
state
interest
might
come
in
and
there
is
no
problem
in
this
particular
case
of
rendering
a
decision
to
that
effect.
i
like
to
address
the
decision
by
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
before
i
finish
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
the
district
court
in
one
of
its
previous
orders
in
which
he
instituted
the
affidavits
system
which
is
the
system
in
which
an
individual
to
obtain
laetrile
has
to
have
an
affidavit
from
his
doctor
to
demonstrate
the
he
has
in
fact
a
member
of
the
class.
judge
bohanon
limited
to
medical
doctors
m.d.s.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
and
i
do
not
--
that's
my
position
your
honor.
the
tenth
circuit's
ruling
which
was
made
to
a
certain
extent
or
completely
without
any
authority
and
support
of
it
made
the
determination
that
laetrile
should
be
used
by
terminally
cancer
patients
and
could
be
for
the
reason
that
the
term
“safe
and
effective”
do
not
have
any
meaning
to
terminal
cancer
patients.
as
to
effective
as
i've
already
said,
i
certainly
agree.
there
is
no
efficacious
treatment
to
cancer
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
that
is
does
not
apply?
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
there
is
no
support
in
the
act
itself
or
anything
in
the
act
just
flat
out
adds
terms
requirements
for
safety
and
efficacy.
the
administrator
--
the
commissioner
of
food
and
drugs
just
had
to
apply
the
act
and
therefore
has
added
administrative
gloss
to
it.
but
there's
nothing
in
either
the
act
no
where
the
administrative
gloss
which
gives
an
exempt
--
an
exemption
for
terminally
ill
cancer
patients
with
the
exemption
of
common
sense.
and
i
believe
that
what
the
tenth
circuit
was
using
when
it
made
its
decision.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
it
was
not.
the
tenth
circuit
opinion
found
that
safe
and
effective
did
not
have
meaning
to
terminal
cancer
patients.
terminal,
it
is
submitted
to
this
court
does
not
have
meaning
or
--
if
efficacious
does
not
have
meaning
to
terminal
cancer
patients.
the
term
safety
to
terminal
cancer
patients
can
in
effect
have
no
more
meaning
than
nontoxic,
and
i
think
the
record
amply
demonstrates
that
laetrile
was
nontoxic.
i
think
it
demonstrates
as
nontoxic
both
as
to
liquid
and
to
tablets.
but
based
upon
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion,
their
argument
is
made
as
this
time
that
is
nontoxic
only
as
to
the
liquid
form.
the
record
is
replete
with
that.
the
judges
--
the
lower
court's
decision
is
replete
with
that.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
have
no
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
no.
the
reason
i
said
it
would
not,
your
honor,
is
because
in
this
particular
--
in
this
particular
instance,
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
--
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
i'm
sorry?
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
i
do
not
disagree
and
nor
does
this
case
disagree,
nor
does
the
lower
court's
opinion's
disagree
with
the
act
--
with
the
food
and
drug
act
or
the
intent
of
it
as
to
safety
and
efficacy.
the
disagreement
is
that
those
two
terms
have
been
very
rigidly
structured
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
not
allow
what
should
be
a
very
obvious
exclusionary
reception
from
the
act.
in
this
case,
we
do
not
object
to
the
fact
that
it
is
limited.
the
plaintiff
class
is
composed
of
terminally
cancer
patients
and
that
is
all
the
case
before
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
ray
coe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
