mr.
solicitor
general,
what
evidence
did
the
district
court
have
before
it
as
a
basis
for
a
finding
that
this
was
nontoxic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
did
make
a
finding
that
it
was
nontoxic,
did
he
not?
that's
my
impression
from
your
--
the
summary
of
your
argument
or
part
of
your
brief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
wasn't
clear
from
what
i
read
whether
it
was
the
second
time
or
the
first
time.
at
anytime,
what
evidence
did
the
district
court
have
of
this
drug,
this
material
being
nontoxic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
did
make
a
finding
that
it
was
nontoxic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you're
done
to
that
if
it
had
any
tendency
of
risk
of
hastening
death.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
mr.
coe.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the

its
use
before

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
commercial
use,
commercial
use
and
that's
the
requirement,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
need
to
stop
to
find
it
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
would
it,
aren't
there
pain
relieving
properties
in
some
drugs
that
would
be
used
on
terminally
ill
patients?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
the
function
of
this
agency,
this
regulatory
body
to
see
that
any
pain
relieving
drugs
are
safe
and
meet
all
the
other
standards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
act
to
the
contrary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
support
in
the
act
for
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.

you
