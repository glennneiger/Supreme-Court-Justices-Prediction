mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
a
drug
or
group
of
drugs
variously
referred
to
in
the
record
a
laetrile
with
a
“capital
l”,
laetrile
with
the
“lowercase
l”,
amygdalin
and
vitamin
b17.
part
of
the
problem
with
this
case
is
the
difficulty
of
distinguishing
just
which
drug
is
referred
to
in
a
particular
context.
generically,
this
drug
or
group
of
drugs
comprised
a
compound
known
as
a
cyanogenetic
glucoside.
i
understand
glucoside
to
be
one
of
a
group
of
organic
compounds
found
in
the
kernels
and
seeds
of
most
fruit
that
hydrolyzed
or
breakdown
to
yield
glucose
which
is
a
sugar,
and
in
the
case
of
a
cyanogenic
glucoside,
hydrogen
cyanide
as
well
which
of
course
is
a
poison.
amygdalin
is
the
name
of
a
cyanogenic
glucoside
that
is
frequently
used
interchangeably
with
laetrile
either
with
the
“capital
l”
or
“small
case
l.”
one
other
definition
might
be
useful,
one
of
the
chemical
definitions
of
laetrile
or
proper
definitions
of
laetrile
has
been
--
was
made
in
the
administered
of
record
as
laevo-mandelonitrile-beta-glucuronoside.
i
say
all
of
that
to
suggest
the
origin
of
the
name
laetrile.
laevo
is
the
first
part
which
means
left
as
i
understand
it
from
the
latin
and
mandelonitrile
is
the
chemical
and
if
we
take
lae
from
leavo
and
the
trile
from
mandelonitrile,
we
have
laetrile,
and
this
is
the
drug
with
which
we
are
concerned
today.
the
left
business,
the
laevo
is
in
contrast
to
dextro
which
would
be
the
right
rotation
and
it
refers
to
the
way
these
two
drugs
show
up
in
polarized
light.
the
proponents
of
this
drug
laetrile
contends
that
it
is
a
cancer
cure
and
in
some
instances,
a
cancer
preventive.
the
process
is
change
from
time
to
time,
but
in
short
it
appears
to
be
the
following.
it
is
the
theory
of
the
proponents
that
laetrile
releases
hydrocyanic
acid,
which
of
course
is
a
poison,
and
it
does
so
in
the
presence
of
an
enzyme
that
allegedly
occurs
in
greater
concentration
in
malignant
cells
than
it
does
in
normal
cells.
and
therefore,
the
malignant
cells
are
destroyed
by
the
action
of
this
chemical.
the
case
comes
before
us
is
a
consequence
of
a
curious
proceeding.
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
prohibits
the
introduction
of
any
new
drug
as
defined
in
the
statute
into
interstate
commerce
unless
a
new
drug
application,
an
nda
supported
by
appropriate
evidence
of
the
drug's
safety
and
effectiveness
has
been
approve
by
the
commissioner
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
who
is
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare's
designate,
or
unless
the
drug
is
exempted
from
the
approval
requirements
by
one
of
the
acts
two
grandfather
provisions,
one
in
1938
and
the
other
in
1962,
both
of
which
are
still
operative.
because
laetrile
had
not
been
established
as
being
entitled
to
grandfather
status
or
is
having
meant
the
statutory
requirements
for
approval
as
a
new
drug,
the
food
and
drug
administration
brought
a
series
of
civil
and
criminal
proceedings
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
laetrile
under
various
names
into
interstate
commerce.
in
march
1975,
respondents
brought
a
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
to
enjoin
the
government
from
interfering
with
the
sale
and
distribution
to
patient
suffering
from
cancer
of
a
substance
known
as
b17,
laetrile
and
amygdalin.
the
district
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
a
question
for
which
i
haven't
good
answer
if
the
court
please
of
the
government
raise
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
their
standing,
but
it
was
decided
adversely
to
the
government
and
it
its
present
posture,
we
suggest
that
on
a
remand,
there
probably
was
jurisdiction.
but
at
this
stage,
i
cannot
answer
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
they
alleged
that
they
wish
to
use
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
they
are
not
producers.
they
alleged
that
they
were
patients
suffering
from
cancer
and
that
they
were
terminally
ill
cancer
patients
and
they
were
later
certified
as
a
class
consisting
of
terminally
ill
cancer
patients
and
they
wish
access
to
the
drug
for
their
therapy
to
be
administered
to
them
by
their
physicians.
the
district
court
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
forbidding
the
government
from
preventing
the
purchase
in
interstate
movement
of
laetrile
for
respondent
rutherford
and
the
other
members
of
the
class
who
could
show
by
affidavit
that
they
were
terminally
ill
with
cancer.
on
appeal
by
the
government,
the
tenth
circuit
upheld
the
granting
of
the
injunction
but
instructed
the
district
court
to
remand
the
case
to
the
commission
for
the
development
of
an
administrative
record
adequate
under
the
administrative
procedures
act,
addressing
the
issues
first
whether
laetrile
is
a
new
drug
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
and
second
if
so,
whether
it
is
exempt
from
the
premarketing
requirements
because
of
either
the
1938
or
the
1962
grandfather
clause.
upon
remand,
the
commissioner
initiated
administrative
proceedings
to
a
federal
register
announcements
seeking
public
comment,
and
the
proceedings
which
included
two
days
of
oral
presentation
produced
more
than
400
submissions
and
more
than
5,000
pages
of
testimony
at
the
conclusion
of
which,
the
commissioner
concluded
first
that
laetrile
is
a
broader
generic
term
for
a
group
of
related
compounds
and
that
in
its
various
forms,
it
is
a
new
drug
within
the
meaning
of
the
food
and
drug
act,
and
that
it
was
definitely
toxic
when
taken
orally,
that
it
had
not
been
adequately
tested
for
safety,
that
is
was
not
generally
recognized
among
experts
a
safe
for
use
in
man,
and
that
distribution
prior
to
meeting
the
premarketing
approval
of
the
fda
would
be
unlawful
unless
it
qualified
for
exempt
status
under
either
grandfather
provision.
he
concluded
that
it
was
not
exempt
under
the
1938
exemption,
grandfather
exemption,
or
the
1962
because
the
drug
that
--
with
which
was
she
was
concerned
had
not
been
used
commercially
under
the
same
or
similar
label
for
therapeutic
purposes
before
either
the
1938
time
or
the
1962
time
which
would've
permitted
it
to
continue
in
commerce.
he
concluded
that
the
distribution
of
laetrile
in
interstate
commerce
is
in
violation
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
and
subject
to
regulatory
action.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
the
district
court
when
it
initially
granted
the
injunction,
i
had
no
evidence
before
it
except
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
the
matter
went
back
to
the
district
court
from
the
administrative
hearing
and
do
i
understand
your
inquiring
about
the
second
time
the
district
court
looked
at
it
the
first
time?
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it's
my
understanding
that
the
district
court
did
not
take
evidence
in
this
matter,
but
relied
on
the
administrative
record
that
was
made.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
he
made
a
finding
when
he
reviewed
this
administrative
record
that
i've
just
related,
which
is
the
next
step
in
the
proceeding
and
what
the
district
court
did
was
to
sustain
the
commissioner's
conclusion
that
laetrile
was
a
new
drug.
he
agreed
that
it
was
not
exempt
under
the
1938
grandfather
clause,
but
he
concluded
that
it
was
exempt
under
the
1962
grandfather
clause,
and
in
doing
so,
we
contend
improperly
reviewed
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
commissioner,
and
that
was
properly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commissioner
to
make
findings.
and
then,
he
did
a
curious
thing
which
we
contend
also
was
in
error.
he
held
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
had
offended
that
constitutional
right
to
privacy
by
denying
the
right
to
use
a
nontoxic
substance
in
connection
with
one's
own
personal
health.
despite
his
find
--
the
commissioner's
finding
that
laetrile
has
a
known
toxicity
when
taken
orally
and
that
it
--
the
testing
is
insufficient
to
determine
its
toxicity
in
any
form.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
agree
that
it
was
a
quite
unnecessary
finding
for
the
district
court
to
make.
but
the
district
court
did
this
nevertheless.
the
government
appealed
it
again
to
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
tenth
circuit
without
addressing
the
grandfather
ground
or
the
constitutional
ground
on
which
the
district
court
relied
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
safety
and
effectiveness
terms
used
in
the
statute
have
no
reasonable
applications
to
terminally
ill
cancer
patients,
and
that
the
food
and
drug
administrator
had
erroneously
applied
the
act
to
these
persons.
nevertheless,
it
modified
the
district
court's
injunction
to
limit
the
use
to
intravenous
injections
administered
by
licensed
medical
practitioner
and
only
to
person
certified
by
a
licensed
medical
practitioner
to
be
terminally
ill
of
cancer
in
some
form,
and
he
directed
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
promulgate
regulations
within
this
limitation
as
if
the
drug
was
found
by
the
commission
to
be
safe
and
effective
for
the
terminally
ill
cancer
patients.
and
the
matter
is
before
this
court
on
the
writ
of
certiorari.
we
submit
that
the
following
questions
are
presented.
first,
whether
the
safety
and
effectiveness
requirements
of
the
federal
food
and
drug
and
cosmetic
act
applied
to
drugs
intended
for
use
by
the
terminally
ill
which
is
the
issue
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
matter.
we
submit
further
that
if
the
court
decides
that
question
as
we
think
it
should,
it
would
want
to
consider
the
two
grounds
found
by
the
district
court
for
enjoining
the
interstate
distribution
of
the
drug,
and
therefore,
it
would
consider
whether
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
barring
application
of
the
act
to
interstate
distribution
of
the
drug
for
intravenous
administration
to
terminally
ill
patients
is
sustainable
on
the
grounds
that
laetrile
is
exempt
because
of
the
premark
--
from
the
premarketing
requirements
because
of
the
1962
grandfathers
clause,
and
finally,
whether
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
sustainable
underground
that
the
prohibition
of
the
interstate
distribution
violates
a
constitutional
right
to
privacy.
i'd
like
to
address
the
first
question
now
if
i
may.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
indeed
they
are,
but
he
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
he's
entitled
to
urge
the
court
to
sustain
the
judgment
on
those
alternative
grounds
and
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
he
has
presented
them,
yes
sir.
the
--
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
misconstrued
the
statute
in
holding
that
the
safety
and
effective
requirements
of
the
act
do
not
apply
to
terminally
ill
persons.
in
the
first
place,
the
act
makes
no
such
exception.
there's
no
language
in
the
act
that
says
that
it
does
not
apply
to
terminally
ill
persons
and
the
legislative
history
does
not
support
this
exception
that's
contended
for.
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
consistently
administered
the
act
without
recognizing
any
such
exception
and
the
congress
has
indicated
its
acquiescence
in
the
adminis
--
the
way
the
act
has
been
administered
because
on
at
least
two
occasions,
it
has
amended
the
act
without
changing
the
construction
that
the
commission
placed
upon
the
statute.
we
further
submit
that
there's
no
reliable
means
of
identifying
the
class
except
in
retrospect.
the
administered
record
teaches
that
cancer
is
a
disease
about
which
very
little
is
known,
that
it
frequently
goes
into
spontaneous
remission
for
reasons
not
understood,
and
that
a
person
designated
is
terminally
ill
may
surprise
his
physician
by
outliving
the
prognosis
that
he
makes
at
the
time
the
designation
is
indicated.
we
also
suggest
that
a
drug
can
be
unsafe
for
a
dying
person
contrary
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
if
it
poses
a
risk
of
shortening
the
life
of
the
terminally
ill
person
or
if
it
poses
the
risk
of
aggravating
the
symptoms
experienced
by
the
so-called
terminally
ill
person.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
of
course,
if
it
was
toxic,
if
it
hastened
death,
it
would
be
a
fortiori
that
it
would
be
unsafe
for
the
terminally
ill
patient.
we
also
suggest
that
the
drug
is
ineffective
as
well
as
unsafe
if
it
does
not
produce
the
effects
of
prolong
life
or
the
(inaudible)
from
pain
that
is
claimed
for.
and
if
it's
ineffective,
then
we
say
the
court
of
appeals
was
erroneous
in
its
determination.
we
also
submit
that
the
terminally
ill
have
the
same
right
to
be
protected
from
ineffective
drugs
just
as
other
people
have,
and
that
the
tenth
circuit
by
substituting
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
agency
charge
by
congress
with
the
responsibility
of
keeping
unsafe
drugs
out
of
the
market
place
was
an
error
and
that
this
court
should
reverse
its
judgment.
the
grandfather's
clause
if
i
may
pass
to
that
and
anticipate
the
argument
that's
in
my
brother's
brief,
that
--
we
submit
and
perhaps
my
brother
will
answer
this
that
there's
no
claim
that
laetrile
was
marketed
commercially
before
1962.
and
of
course
to
be
within
the
grandfather's
clause,
the
person
contending
the
exemption
must
show
commercial
marketing.
and
we
submit
that
there
was
not
and
we
submit
that
the
brief
that
the
administrative
record
is
very
clear
about
that.
the
commissioner
also
found
that
the
composition
of
different
substances
referred
to
as
laetrile
before
and
after
1962
very
listed
their
formulations
so
that
no
one
could
state
with
certainty
just
what's
subject
had
been
grandfathered,
and
of
course,
there
would
be
another
for
the
grandfather's
clause
not
to
apply.
we
also
submit
that
the
record
supports
the
commissioner's
conclusion
that
the
drug
was
not
generally
recognized
as
safe
as
required
by
section
201
(p).
he
found
specifically
that
there
was
a
hazard
of
cyanide
poisoning
and
the
record
shows
that
when
ingested
orally,
the
drug
has
a
very
definite
toxic
effect
and
that
there
was
insufficient
testing
of
its
consequences
when
taken
by
injections
parenterally.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
think
the
person
who
asserted
the
exemption
would
have
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
can't
think
of
a
case
it's
specifically
addresses
that
question.
but
normally,
a
person
claiming
an
exemption
from
a
general
rule
in
the
ordinary
theory
of
the
allocation
of
burden
would
have
to
sustain
it.
this
case
is
curious
in
another
respect.
it's
not
the
typical
food
and
drug
case,
and
so
the
manner
of
burden
--
who
bears
the
burden,
takes
on
an
interesting
aspect.
here,
we
have
patients
contending
that
they
have
a
right
to
use
a
drug,
and
it's
not
the
typical
case
of
the
manufacturer
of
a
drug
seeking
of
clearance
for
it
when
he
would
understand
what
he
had
to
show.
we
think
the
contrary
to
the
finding
of
a
district
court
that
the
commissioner
was
extremely
fair
in
the
hearing
that
he
conducted
because
he
invited
persons
who
were
sponsors
of
the
drug,
who
were
not
themselves
cancer
patients
to
present
evidence
and
he
consider
their
evidence
in
arriving
at
his
conclusion.
we
suggest
that
there's
another
reason
why
the
grandfather's
clause
does
not
apply
because
the
only
labeling
of
the
drug
before
1962
was
for
investigational
use
only,
and
not
for
commercial
use.
it
was
labeled
to
instruct
physicians
who
were
conducting
experiments
in
its
use
and
as
such,
it
did
not
qualify
for
the
grandfather's
clause.
finally,
we
say
that
the
district
court
employed
an
improper
standard
of
review
by
overturning
the
commissioner's
findings
of
fact.
there
was
evidence
to
support
every
one
of
the
commissioner's
findings.
we
submit
that
it
was
his
right
to
do
this
and
that
the
district
court
improperly
evaded
the
province
of
the
administered
of
agency
in
making
these
findings.
finally,
we
would
address
the
constitutional
issue.
in
the
first
place,
we
say
that
the
asserted
right
of
privacy
which
would
give
a
terminal
patient
the
right
to
use
this
drug
is
premised
upon
something
that
is
not
so.
it
is
premised
on
the
unwarranted
belief
that
laetrile
has
been
shown
to
be
nontoxic.
and
we
submit
that
the
record
shows
clearly
that
it
is
toxic.
and
if
it
is,
the
entire
premise
for
this
determination
is
destroyed
and
the
conclusion
should
fall.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
is
certainly
true
taken
orally
and
there
is
no
adequate
investigation
of
its
consequences
when
taken
by
injection.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
you
cannot
say
that
it
is
not
toxic.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
the
conclusion
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
is
so
limited
and
we
suggest
two
things
from
that.
first,
the
limitation
that
was
gratuitous
indicates
that
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
the
toxicity
when
taken
orally.
but
we
also
suggest
that
it
is
his
premise
that
a
person
has
a
constitutional
right
to
use
a
nontoxic
drug,
and
it
would
appeal
then
that
if
there
is
no
evidence
of
toxicity
or
not,
that
his
conclusion
fails.
particularly
when
the
drug
is
shown
to
be
toxic
in
one
form
and
when
it
is
clear
that
one
of
its
components
is
a
deadly
poison,
and
no
one
knows
whether
it
is
released
in
the
--
when
taken
parenterally,
when
injected
instead
of
ingested.
we
also
suggest
that
this
court
in
discussing
the
right
of
privacy
has
not
extended
it
beyond
protecting
the
individual
interest
in
making
independent
decisions
in
matters
relating
to
marriage,
procreation,
family
relationships,
and
childbearing
and
education.
in
whalen
versus
roe,
this
court
in
429
u.s.
page
600
in
footnote
26
said
expressly
that
the
right
to
privacy
did
not
extend
to
the
drugs
that
were
involved
there
that
were
subject
to
potential
abuse.
it
would
also
suggest
that
the
court
has
made
it
clear
that
even
in
these
protected
areas,
the
right
of
a
person
not
to
be
regulated
might
be
restricted
in
the
interest
of
protecting
the
health
of
the
person
concerned.
now,
we
point
to
the
abortion
cases,
the
case
that
involved
the
saline
amniocentesis
method
of
abortion,
where
the
court
said
that
this
wasn't
the
prohibition
there
wasn't
to
protect
the
health
of
the
woman,
but
it
was
for
a
different
purpose,
and
an
improper
purpose.
in
here,
the
concern
if
for
the
health
would
not
be
prohibited.
also,
we
suggest
that
historically,
the
exercise
of
the
police
power
to
protect
people
from
harmful
drugs
or
improperly
labeled
drugs
is
far
antedates
the
constitution
when
the
constitution
was
adopted,
this
was
a
common
practice.
in
fact,
we
show
in
our
appendix
that
it
began
in
1266,
i
guess
that's
200
years
after
the
norman
conquest
and
continuously
in
anglo-american
history,
public
health
has
been
protected.
i
see
the
--
my
time
is
nearly
expired
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time
i
might
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
that
a
new
drug
application
has
been
filed
with
the
fda
for
that.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i've
heard
that,
too.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
i
think
i
have
read
too
that
experimental
uses
has
been
authorized
and
i
think
i
read
recently
that
someone
who
is
authorized
to
use
it
experimentally
have
been
arrested.
i
think
in
one
of
the
new
england
states
for
possessing
marijuana
that
he
said
was
furnished
in
were
authorized
by
the
food
and
drug
administration.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
litigation.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
right.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
am
aware
of
that,
but
i'm
not
aware
that
any
state
has
does
this.
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
that
the
only
state
that's
addressed
this
question
of
the
--
of
a
right
to
privacy
challenged
to
self-medication
is
california
in
people
versus
privitera,
which
was
just
decided
march
15,
1979.
california
found
under
both
the
federal
and
state
constitution,
no
constitutionally
protected
right
to
take
a
particular
drug,
of
course
medication.
if
i
have
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
just
have
this
mr.
chief
justice
in
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
and
i
was
unable
to
give
him
the
citation.
in
fact,
i
told
him
i
wasn't
aware
of
it.
on
page
163-a
of
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
state
that
the
court
in
bentex
ulcerine
held
at
469
f.
2d
at
878
that
a
party
seeking
to
shows
that
a
drug
comes
within
the
grandfather
exemptions,
“must
prove
every
essential
fact
necessary
for
invocation
of
the
exception.”
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
it
could,
but
this
is
a
constitutional
determination
that
it
may
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
worries
me,
too.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court,
the
government
submits
its
case
on
its
brief.
