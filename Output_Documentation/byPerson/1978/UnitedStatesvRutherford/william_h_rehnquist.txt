justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
an
additional
curiosity
about
the
district
court's
constitutional
holding
and
that
he'd
already
found
that
it
was
covered
by
the
grandfather
clause
in
1962
so
it
didn't
have
to
reach
that
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
this
case
get
to
the
district
court,
mr.
coe?
it
was
it
--
i
don't
know,
originally
an
application
for
administrative
review?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
wasn't
the
application
or
administrative
review
under
the
heinemann?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
the
administrative
procedure
act
prohibits
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
prohibits
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
if
you
say
that
554
sub
(c)
prohibited
the
sort
of
proceedings
conducted
by
the
food
and
drug
administration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
indirectly
you
say
it
that
is
--
what
the
fda
did
here
is
prohibited
by
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know
i
presume
the
tenth
circuit
has
the
right
to
construe
the
statute
but
not
to
impose
its
own
requirements.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
part
of
the
apa?
is
that
part
of
the
administrative
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
there
not
just
judges,
they
presumably
have
some
right
to
decide
what
positions
to
take
on
things.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
they
simply
weren't
open
even
to
persuasion
by
new
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
chief
justice's
question
that
even
the
terminally
ill
patient
may
need
relief
from
symptomatic
conditions,
not
a
cure,
perhaps
not
even
remission
relief
from
pain.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
tenth
circuit
would
exempt
that
and
say
go
down
by
a
few
grains
of
morphine
if
you
feel
you
needed
to
relieve
the
pain?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
position
on
that?
