justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
you
one
question.
i
read
in
the
press
that
marijuana
is
very
helpful
in
relieving
pain
in
cancer
patients.
has
the
fda
ever
addressed
that
question
that
arises
with
respect
to
marijuana?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i've
been
told
that's
used
for
that
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
coe,
you
seem
to
concede
that
the
constitutional
right
would
not
exist
without
the
doctor's
supervision
or
do
you?
the
only
constitutional
right
to
take
this
drug
in
a
particular
way
of
a
doctor
supervises.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
acknowledge
that
the
state
can
impose
a
regulatory
control
for
the
safety
even
if
the
terminally
ill
of
cancer
patient
by
saying
the
doctor
has
to
supervise
it,
why
would
not
the
constitution
also
give
the
state
the
power
to
say
well,
certain
kinds
of
drugs,
heroin,
marijuana,
whatever
it
might
be,
laetrile,
cannot
be
use
for
these
people.
what's
the
difference
between
a
flat
rule
against
a
particular
kind
of
drug
and
the
condition
that
the
doctor
approved
of
it
in
terms
of
constitutional
terms?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
assuming
the
first
of
my
question,
they
had
been
diagnose
as
terminally
ill
by
the
doctor,
but
then
the
question
is
do
they
--
why
did
they
need
doctor
supervision
to
take
the
drug
any
more
than
they
need?
why
is
that
anymore
acceptable
than
fda
prove
of
the
particular
drug
to
be
taken?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
they
live
--
what
if
oklahoma
had
a
state
rule
that
said
that
be
a
doctor
be
guilty
of
malpractice
if
he
prescribe
laetrile
because
i
have
not
been
approved
by
the
fda?
would
that
--
i
suppose
such
a
rule
would
be
unconstitutional
in
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
coe,
i
have
one
other
question,
the
constitutional
argument.
you
make
the
same
argument
for
--
if
--
would
it
apply
equally
to
one
who
is
not
a
terminally
ill
cancer
patient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it's
nontoxic
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it's
nontoxic,
they
don't
know
why
it
would
be
equally.
