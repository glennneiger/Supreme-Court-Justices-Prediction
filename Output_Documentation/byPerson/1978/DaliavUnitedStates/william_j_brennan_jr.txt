justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ruprecht,
how
was
the
break
and
entry
accomplished?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
the
second
instance,
it
was
the
window
in
fact
locked?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
when
you
said
pried
open,
the
implication
of
pried
is
that
it
was
locked.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
3109.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
counterpart
in
this
situation
of
3109?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
obviously
can't
apply
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can't
require
that
firstly
knock
in
the
door
and
announce
who
they
are
and
why
they're
coming.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
3109
is
a
congressional
limitation
upon
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
don't
suggest
it
does
but
what
i'm
asking
you
is
you're
arguing
that
title
iii
also--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
constitures.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
--
a
congressional
regulation
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
--
what
specifically
in
title
iii
do
you
think
provides
this
regulation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
do
we
write
it
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
don't
--
perhaps
i
don't
follow
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
because
it
siren
it's
forbidden.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
it
be
constitutional?
with
constitution
requires
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
your
second
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
certainly
wasnâ€™t
settled
in
miller?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
a
division
in
kerr?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
miller
was
certainly
not
a
constitutional
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it?
