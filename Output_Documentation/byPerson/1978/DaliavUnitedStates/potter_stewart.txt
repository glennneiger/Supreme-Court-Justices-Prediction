mr.
ruprecht,
the
breaking
and
entering
was
not
necessary
in
order
to
overhear
the
telephone
conversations
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
wasn't
in
fact
connected
with
the
tap
on
the
telephones.

outside
the
--
outside
the
office.
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice

statute
by
necessary
implication.
justice

stewart
so
inherently
at
least
sometimes
necessary
to
the
interception
of
oral
communication
as
a
factual
matter.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
argument
as
you
well
know
of
course
is
that
when
congress
authorized
within
the
limitations
of
the
statute,
the
interception
of
oral
communications
it
necessarily
authorized
whatever
was
necessary
to
make
those
oral
interceptions
and
that
factually
--
this
is
a
factual
matter
quite
apart
from
the
needs
of
law
enforcement
or
anything
else
with
just
a
factual
matter
that
at
least
sometimes
and
probably
most
of
the
time
surreptitious
breaking
and
entering
is
necessary
to
make
an
oral
interception.
justice

going
back
to
3109
for
a
minute.
is
it
your
view
that
if
3109
had
not
been
enacted
that
what
it
now
provides
would
nevertheless
be
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
what
you
have
read
doesn’t
say
much
more
than
the
statute,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
will
you
read
that
again
if
you,
sorry
i
[inaudible]
my
colleagues,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
obviously
if
you
are
going
to
have
electronic
bugging,
something
has
to
be
installed?
justice
potter
stewart
the
mic
has
to
be
installed?
justice
potter
stewart
putting
a
olive
in
a
martini
is
an
installation
of
the
olive
into
the
drink?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
install
is
the
only
word
that’s
the,
that’s
the
word
i
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
anything
in
plain
view
would
be
admissible
if
you
are
right,
that
is
currently
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
were
lawfully
present
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
anything
in
plain
view
would
be
admissible?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
proceed,
i
just
want
to
identify
one
problem
you
may
come
to
it
later
in
your
argument.
do
you
view
section
3109
as
changing
the
law
that
preexisted
in
this
test
statute,
maybe
you
are
going
to
cover
that
later.
