mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
has
presented
three
separate
grounds
in
support
of
his
contention
that
the
agents'
surreptitious
entry
into
his
unoccupied
business
premises
for
the
purpose
of
planting
of
listening
devices
that
were
necessary
to
carry
out
the
court
authorized
eavesdropping
was
unlawful
and
requires
suppression
of
the
intercepted
conversations.
first,
although
he
didn’t
put
it
first
in
his
brief,
but
i
think
he
has
continued
to
maintain
the
position,
he
contends
that
such
surreptitious
entries
are
absolutely
barred
by
the
fourth
amendment
regardless
of
the
existence
of
any
congressional
authorization
for
them
or
the
presence
of
any
court
order
authorizing
them.
second,
he
contends
that
even
if
such
entries
could
be
carried
out
consistently
with
the
fourth
amendment,
congress
has
either
prohibited
or
failed
to
authorize
them
in
title
iii
or
elsewhere.
third,
he
contends
that
even
if
there
is
no
constitutional
or
statutory
barrier
to
such
entries,
the
agents'
action
in
this
case
was
unlawful
because
of
their
failure
to
procure
from
the
district
court
an
express
authorization
of
the
entries
that
were
necessary
to
carry
out
the
court’s
title
iii
order.
now
before
i
begin
the
argument
i
think
there
is
a
factual
background
that
came
up
slightly
yesterday
and
there
is
some
misconception
around
as
to
the
question
of
the
need
to
make
trespassory
entries
for
purposes
of
planting
the
listening
devices
in
connection
with
eavesdropping
orders.
there
is
language
in
berger
opinion
of
this
court
10
years
ago,
which
i
think
was
still
several
decades
before
its
time
in
terms
of
talking
about
electronic
beams
from
outside
and
what
we’ve
called
in
our
brief
the
buck
rogers
kind
of
equipment.
as
matters
stand
today
there
are
very,
very
few
cases
if
any
of
surveillance
of
interior
areas
where
that
kind
of
equipment
is
useful
as
a
practical
matter.
similarly
the
martini
olive
transmitter
and
so
on
is
virtually
never
used
in
these
cases
because
radio
transmitters
are
not
used
because
they
are
easily
detected
by
a
scanner
that
you
can
buy
at
radioshack
for
a
few
dollars.
so
that
in
the
normal
case
when
you
are
talking
about
a
title
iii
eavesdropping
order
of
an
office
or
some
interior
area
you
are
talking
about
the
need
for
some
kind
of
what
was
viewed
as
a
trespassory
entry
prior
to
katz.
now
in
--
we’ve
been
advised
by
the
fbi
that
in
perhaps
slightly
fewer
than
10%
of
the
cases
the
spike
mic
through
the
wall
kind
of
approach
is
available
and
that
would
be
normally
the
cases
where
the
fbi
is
able
to
obtain
control
of
the
adjoining
space,
for
instance
if
it’s
a
hotel
room
and
they
can
rent
the
adjoining
hotel
room
or
an
office
and
they
can
rent
the
adjoining
office.
but
in
all
other
cases
some
kind
of
a
physical
entry
of
the
agents
into
the
premises
together
with
a
fairly
extended
period
of
time
necessary
because
this
is
a
wire
installation,
it’s
not
a
matter
of
putting
a
radio
transmitter
and
but
of
installing
something
and
running
wires
out
to
a
receiver
is
necessary.
now
they
do
use
ruses
in
a
certain
proportion
of
the
cases,
but
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases
are
entries
such
as
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
about
12
to
14
illustrative
instances
of
testimony
before
congress
about
how
surveillances
were
conducted
and
it
was
clear
to
congress
that
trespassory
entries
of
the
kind
that
occurred
in
this
case
would
be
frequently
necessary.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
our
argument,
there
are
references
in
the
hearings,
there
are
references
in
the
debates,
there
are
references
in
the
president’s
commission
report
which
was
relied
on
heavily
by
congress
and
of
course
berger
itself
which
was
a
single
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
to
some
extent
we
must
speculate
about
what
individual
members
of
congress
expected.
however,
i
will
get
to
the
point
that
there
is
evidence
i
think
in
the
senate
report
itself
that
congress
intended
to
allow
the
installation
of
eavesdropping
devices
of
the
kind
that
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
think
it’s
clear,
but
there
is
talk
and
mr.
ruprecht
suggested
yesterday
that
there
might
be
many
ways
you
might
insinuate
a
confederate
or
an
informant
and
well
that
simply
is
not
practical.
you
might
use
a
ruse,
but
what
i’m
suggesting
is
the
kind
of
ruse
that
you
need
is
one
that
gives
you
access
to
the
man’s
office
for
a
couple
of
hours.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
what,
i
don’t
--
i
can’t
cite
you
at
the
moment
any
particular
place
in
the
legislative
history
where
there
is
a
statement
that
reflects
congress’s
understanding
of
the
facts
as
i’ve
told
you
this
morning,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
that
they
knew
and
there
is
absolutely
no
place
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
they
intended
to
prohibit
surreptitious
entries
of
the
kind
that
occurred
in
berger.
let
me
pass
for
the
moment
the
broad
constitutional
contention
of
petitioners
because
i
think
that
is
sufficiently
insubstantial
that
i
should
get
on
to
other
more
important
questions
in
terms
of
the
question
of
the
existence
if
any
is
necessary
of
statutory
authority
for
a
surreptitious
entry
to
install
listening
device.
now
i
believe
that
on
close
analysis
to
answer
to
this
question
is
fairly
clear
and
it
is
as
we
are
arguing
it,
but
the
sixth
and
ninth
circuits
have
concluded
that
there
is
no
power
in
the
federal
judiciary
to
authorize
eavesdropping
that
entails
surreptitious
entry
into
private
premises.
and
these
decisions
of
course
are
of
grave
concern
to
the
department
of
justice.
so
they
have
rendered
it
virtually
impossible
for
the
government
to
use
the
authority
conferred
by
title
iii
to
intercept
oral
communications
in
the
effort
to
combat
organized
crimes
in
the
state,
organized
crime
in
the
states
within
those
circuits.
now
in
considering
this
question
of
statutory
authority
i
think
we
should
first
look
at
title
iii
itself
and
consider
three
possible
conclusions
that
might
be
reached
about
the
effect
of
that
enactment.
the
first
which
is
what
i
understand
petitioner’s
argument
to
be
is
that
title
iii
prohibits
surreptitious
entries
into
private
premises
to
install
listening
devices.
the
second,
which
we
would
contend
on
the
other
side
is
that
title
iii
is
itself
a
source
of
authority
for
such
entries.
the
third
possible
conclusion
is
that
title
iii
neither
confers
nor
withdraws
authority,
so
that
the
source
of
authority,
if
any,
specific
source
is
necessary
must
be
sought
elsewhere.
now
with
regard
to
petitioner’s
proposition
and
i
think
the
conclusion
of
at
least
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
did
give
more
consideration
to
alternatives
that
title
iii’s
failure
to
contain
express
provisions
regulating
the
authorization
of
trespassory
entries
to
plant
listening
devices
reflects
a
congressional
purpose
or
at
least
a
congressional
accomplishment
of
the
end
of
banning
or
withdrawing
authority
for
such
entries.
now
we
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
for
the
court
to
impute
the
congress
such
bizarre
and
self
defeating
action.
after
all
while
title
iii
was
designed
in
part
to
protect
the
citizenry
from
unconstitutional
invasions
of
communicational
privacy
as
well
as
from
non
governmental
invasions
of
communicational
privacy,
it
was
indisputably
also
intended
within
constitutional
limits
to
enable
law
enforcements
officers
to
use
electronic
surveillance
to
combat
organized
crime.
and
what
was
the
case
that
congress
was
studying
most
closely
in
its
efforts
to
design
a
constitutionally
acceptable
system
to
enable
law
enforcement
officers
to
conduct
electronic
surveillance,
that
case
was
berger
against
new
york
and
what
was
it
that
the
officers
did
in
berger,
that
congress
we
submit
plainly
sought
to
allow
in
future
cases,
they
surreptitiously
entered
a
business
office
to
plant
a
listening
device.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
we
would
reach
the
same
conclusion,
but
it
is
possible
that
the
court
would
view
the
issues.
i
mean
we
don’t
deny
that
there
is
some
more
sensitivity
in
entering
a
private
home
than
there
is
in
entering
a
business
office,
although
both
are
protected
by
the
warrant
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment,
but
i
think
we
would
ultimately
come
to
the
same
position.
now
is
it
reasonable
to
conclude
that
congress
while
on
the
one
hand
trying
to
legalize
law
enforcement
eavesdropping
in
circumstances
like
the
berger
case,
on
the
other
hand
sub
silentio
concluded
that
surreptitious
entries
such
as
were
in
berger
were
so
offensive
that
they
ought
not
to
be
permitted.
it
is
that
implausible
premise
that
petitioner
asked
this
court
to
adopt
and
that
underlies
the
sixth
and
ninth
circuit
decisions
in
finazzo
and
santora.
now
i’d
just
come
back
and
mention
that
while
the
legislative
history
is
not
as
clear
as
we
would
like,
there
is
no
question
that
congress
was
repeatedly
told
that
the
kind
of
eavesdropping
in
berger
and
that
it
was
studying
would
often
or
usually
involve
surreptitious
physical
entry
into
the
premises
where
the
conversations
are
to
take
place.
now
it
nevertheless
decided
to
authorize
interceptions
of
oral
communications
without
restriction
as
to
the
places
where
such
communications
could
be
intercepted.
and
in
fact
we
quote
a
statement
by
senator
tydings
in
our
brief
at
page
38
in
which
he
describes
a
fact
situation
very
much
like
berger
and
he
was
one
of
the
principle
sponsors
of
the
bill
and
states
his
view
that
it
is
offensive
that
this
mafia
figure
or
organized
crime
figure
who
he
was
talking
about
could
not
be
convicted
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
bill
was
to
facilitate
or
legalize
under
appropriate
controls
the
kind
of
entry
to
plant
a
listening
device
that
occurred
in
that
case.
now
petitioner
stresses
what
he
perceives
to
be
the
congressional
silence
on
the
subject
to
surreptitious
entries
as
evidenced
that
it
did
not
intend
to
permit
them
for
title
iii
searches,
but
congress
was
not
utterly
silent.
the
senate
report
in
describing
what
the
legislation
generally
set
out
to
accomplish
and
it
stated
at
page
40
of
our
brief
said,
“legislation
meaning
the
constitutional
standard
set
out
in
the
decisions,”
referring
to
katz
and
berger,
“and
granting
law
enforcement
officers
the
authority
to
tap
telephone
wires
and,”
and
this
is
just
the
key
language,
“install
electronic
surveillance
devices
in
the
investigation
of
major
crimes
and
upon
obtaining
the
court
order
which
is
the
purpose
of
title
iii
of
s917,”
and
then
they
list
the
groups
that
have
endorsed
that
legislation.
so
while
the
statements
don’t
proliferate
on
the
subject
we
take
that
as
a
clear
statement
of
the
congressional
intent
to
authorize
this.
now
we
submit
that
congress
did
not
dwell
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don’t
think
the
statute
talks
about
installing--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
statement
says
that
in
describing
the
–
well,
i’ll
just
take
a
little
bit
out
of
order
in
describing
what’s
the
major
purpose
of
title
iii.
the
statement
says,
“granting
law
enforcement
officers
that
authority
to
tap
telephone
wires
and
install
electronic
surveillance
devices
in
the
investigation
of
major
crimes
and
upon
obtaining
a
court
order.”
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
no,
not
as
they
were
thinking
of
--
if
they
were
thinking
as
has
been
suggested--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
yes
but
the
suggestion
has
been
made
in
for
instance
in
the
opinion
in
finazzo
that
often
you
don’t
have
to
drop
the
transmitter
in
the
martini,
you
use
the
parabolic
mic
from
a
distance,
many
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
then
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
sense.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that’s
a
significant
word
and
that’s
the
word
that
i’m
calling
for
the
court’s
attention
here,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
was
installed
surreptitiously.
we’ve
checked
the
record
and
i
am
advised
that
it
was
installed
surreptitiously
and
that
there
was
no
separate
entry
or
at
least
in
the
first
of
the
two
bugs
in
berger
and
the
statute
of
course
contained
no
express
entry
provision.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
aware
of
anything.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now,
it’s
our
argument
that
congress
did
not
dwell
on
the
subject
of
surreptitious
entries
because
it
simply
didn’t
suspect
there
was
any
serious
problem.
nothing
in
any
prior
decision
of
this
court
had
sounded
any
alarm
on
this
particular
subject
and
of
course
rule
41
governing
conventional
searches
itself
says
nothing
about
express
separate
entry
authorization.
we
think
that
congress
assumed
that
having
authorized
the
search
itself
and
a
detailed
provision
satisfying
what
it
understood
the
fourth
amendment
to
require,
it
was
thereby
authorizing
the
implementation
of
the
search
by
the
means
that
were
reasonably
necessary
to
do
so.
now
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
make
our
position
as
to
the
statutory
source
of
authority
clear
because
in
reading
over
our
brief
and
preparing
for
the
argument,
i
am
afraid
it
may
state
the
matter
in
a
fashion
that
it’s
subject
to
misinterpretation.
in
part
2
of
our
brief,
we
were
addressing
the
contention
of
petitioner
and
the
conclusion
of
the
sixth
and
ninth
circuits
that
title
iii
does
not
itself
authorize
entries
to
plant
listening
devices
and
that
accordingly
such
entries
may
not
occur.
we
showed
convincingly
i
hope
that
if
that
promise
was
correct,
the
conclusion
was
not
correct
because
rule
41
provides
the
power
to
authorize
trespassory
entries
if
one
must
look
elsewhere
then
title
iii
for
such
power.
now
we
didn’t
mean
by
this
argument
to
suggest
that
title
iii
is
not
itself
a
source
of
authority.
we
believe
that
it
is,
but
we
recognize
that
there
are
two
ways
to
look
at
the
entry
that
took
place
here.
the
first
which
several
courts
have
adapted
is
to
view
it
as
an
incident
of
the
search
authorized
by
the
title
iii
order,
it's
so
viewed
and
we
believe
this
is
the
best
view
of
it.
title
iii
itself
supplies
the
authority
for
the
entry
to
carry
out
the
search,
just
as
rule
41
implicitly
authorizes
the
entry
to
accomplish
a
conventional
search.
on
the
other
hand
several
courts
have
concluded
that
the
entry
entails
a
wholly
separate
invasion
of
a
distinct
constitutionally
protected
interest
rather
than
an
intrusion
ancillary
to
the
electronic
surveillance
with
which
title
iii
is
concerned.
under
that
view,
one
could
perhaps
reasonably
contend
that
title
iii
supplies
no
authority
for
the
entry.
but
that
conclusion
does
not
resolve
the
inquiry
in
petitioner’s
favor,
rather
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
rule
41
supplies
the
authority
for
distinct
trespassory
intrusions
of
the
kind
that
petitioner
by
hypothesis
finds
present
here.
now
unless
the
court
has
further
questions
on
the
statutory
issue,
i’ll
pass
on
now
to
the
question
of
the
need
for
an
express
entry
provision.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
indeed
we’ll
come
to
that
in
the
portion
--
i
don’t
think
--
i’ll
come
to
that
in
the
next
portion
of
my
argument
discussing
the
need
for
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
the
course
of
doing
what
is
reasonably
necessary
to
carry
out
the
court’s
title
iii
order,
anything
that
comes
into
plain
view
would
be
admissible.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
you
were
lawfully
present.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
i
would
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
view
section
3109
as
imposing
a
restriction
on
the
manner
in
which
the
police
may
execute
search
warrants
of
houses
and
we
believe
it
applies
only
to
occupied
premises.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don’t
and
we
think
that
the
statute
after
all
was
originally
adopted
as
part
of
a
package
of
laws
in
the
3100
series
that
most
of
which
is
now
incorporated
in
rule
41.
so
that
our
understanding
is
that
rule
41
conveyed
to
magistrates
the
authority
to
authorize
searches
and
to
officers
the
authority
to
carry
out
such
searches,
and
3109
passed
a
special
rule
in
accordance
with
the
common
law
rule
and
perhaps
constitutionally
required
i
think
that’s
an
issue
that’s
not
clearly
settled,
regarding
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
we’re
not
suggesting
that
it's
settled
and
it
was
the
subject
of
a
division
of
opinion
in
kerr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
we
think
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
think
you
said
in
kerr
that
miller
was
a
supervisory
power
opinion,
but
it
was
your
view
that
that
was
a
constitutional
underpinning.
but
for
purposes
of
this
case
i
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
for
the
court
to
consider
whether
3109
is
constitutional
or
statutory
because
we
think
it's
plain
that
3109
doesn’t
apply
to
this
kind
of
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
question
i
have
argued
so
far
that
there
is
statutory
authorization.
there
is
an
argument
that
no
statutory
authorization
is
needed
as
well
and
that
depends
on
how
the
court
views
the
relationship
of
the
trespassory
entry
to
the
search
that
was
authorized
by
a
court
order
and
depending
on
how
it’s
viewed
you
may
or
may
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
nothing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
the
judge
inquiring
into
it
and
indeed
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there,
in
our
view
it’s,
it
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
understand
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
our
view
it
is
good
policy
for
us
to
go
to
the
magistrate,
explain
to
him
or
judge
in
a
case
of
a
title
iii
order,
explain
to
him
how
we
are
going
to
carry
out
the
entry
and
obtain
in
the
title
iii
order
an
express
authorization,
that
is
now
the
department’s
policy
and
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
this
case
we
would
continue
that
policy
because
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
is
no
--
he
said
that.
we
agree
with
that
but
the
fact
that
we
may
have
been
imprudent
in
this
case
is
not
a
basis
for
over
turning
mr.
dalia’s
conviction.
now
turning
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
need
for
an
express
entry
authorization
in
the
eavesdropping
order.
there
is
of
course
no
such
requirement
contained
and
visible
in
title
iii
and
we
suggest
that
the
issue
is
a
purely
constitutional
one.
now,
i
want
to
begin
my
discussion
at
this
point
by
making
clear
that
we
are
not
suggesting
the
no
warrant
at
all
is
necessary
for
surreptitious
trespassory
entry
into
an
office
or
home.
of
course,
our
argument
is
that
the
warrant
issued
by
judge
lacey
in
this
case
authorizing
the
interception
of
oral
communications
in
petitioner's
enclosed
office
confer
the
requisite
authority
for
the
entry
that
was
made.
cases
like
silverman
and
katz
thus
do
not
help
petitioner
at
all
since
they
involve
no
warrant
of
any
kind.
now
it’s
undisputed
that
the
court’s
title
iii
order
in
this
case
met
all
the
stated
requirements
of
the
warrant
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
was
sought
under
oath,
a
probable
cause
was
shown
and
the
order
particularly
described
the
place
to
be
searched
which
is
of
special
relevance
here
and
also
the
things
to
be
seized.
the
entry
was
a
necessary
aspect
of
the
execution
of
the
court’s
order,
but
in
our
view
it
was
implicitly
authorized
in
the
same
way
as
i’ve
said
before
than
any
entry
necessary
to
execute
a
conventional
search
as
implicitly
authorized
by
rule
41
warrant.
now
in
making
our
argument,
we
are
also
not
contending
and
this
gets
to
justice
rehnquist's
point
that
the
title
iii
order
alone
suffices
to
give
the
agents
an
unlimited
license
to
do
as
they
please
in
executing
the
order.
just
as
with
the
conventional
search,
the
agents
must
act
reasonably
in
the
means
they
select
to
implement
the
title
iii
order
and
the
reasonableness
of
their
actions
is
subject
to
post
search
judicial
inquiry.
here
that
inquiry
occurred
and
both
lower
courts
found
that
the
surreptitious
entry
was
in
fact
reasonable
and
necessary
to
execute
the
eavesdrop
order.
now,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
the
vast
majority
of
eavesdropping
of
enclosed
interior
locations
will
require
a
physical
trespass.
the
situation
is
not
materially
different
from
that
of
a
conventional
search.
now,
often
a
single
conventional
search
can
involve
an
intrusion
into
several
arguably
distinct
privacy
interests.
yet,
the
satisfaction
of
the
express
requirements
of
the
warrant
clause
is
normally
considered
sufficient.
now,
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
of
a
warrant
to
search
the
second
floor
rear
room
of
a
house.
in
the
course
of
executing
that
warrant
which
particularly
describes
the
place
to
be
searched,
the
officers
may
hypothetically
at
least
have
a
choice
of
entering
the
front
or
the
back
door,
walking
through
the
living
room
or
the
dining
room
or
some
other
rooms
where
they
are
arguably
distinct
privacy
interests.
i
am
aware
of
no
case
which
suggest
that
they
have
to
get
a
separate
warrant
or
that
the
magistrate
expressly
has
to
describe
how
they
do
it.
that's
not
to
say
that
they
don’t
have
to
do
it
reasonably
when
they
go
into
the
premises
they
can’t
go
into
other
bedrooms
that
are
not
on
the
way
to
the
bedroom
that
they’re
authorized
to
search.
now,
let
me
come
back
to
a
point
that
mr.
justice
white
made
yesterday
which
i
think
is
a
very
powerful
point
in
our
favor
on
this
issue
and
that
is
the
effect
of
arrest
warrants
on
the
authorization
of
interest.
i
think
the
law
generally
is
at
least
in
the
lower
courts
and
there
is
some
suggestion
implicitly
in
this
court
although
i
assume
the
question
is
open
to
reexamination
that
an
arrest
warrant
would
authorize
the
officers
to
enter
the
home
of
the
person
named
in
the
warrant
on
at
least
let’s
say
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
person
is
present
in
order
to
carry
out
the
arrest.
now,
this
is
a
very
parallel
situation
to
the
present
situation.
indeed
logically
our
case
is,
i
think
stronger
because
in
the
case
of
an
arrest
warrant,
there
is
a
very
substantial
chance
that
the
individual
will
be
in
a
public
place
or
alternatively
that
when
you
knock
at
his
door,
ring
his
bell,
he
will
come
to
the
door
and
no
entry
will
be
necessary.
nevertheless,
the
state
of
the
law
in
the
lower
courts
at
least
is
clear
that
the
arrest
warrant
authorizes
the
entry
and
i
may
mention
another
fact
that
makes
our
case
much
stronger.
we
have
a
description
in
our
title
iii
order
of
the
location,
the
entry
into
which
is
being
challenged
here,
an
arrest
warrant
would
contain
no
description.
so
it’s
difficult
for
me
to
see
if
the
court
rules
against
us
in
this
case
how
it
can
be
squared
with
the
present
doctrine
and
an
arrest
warrant
appears
to
justify
an
entry
into
the
suspect’s
premises.
now,
finally
just
to
make
a
couple
of
or
to
make
one
other
point,
the
court
is
free,
it
has
the
power
as
justice
marshall
suggested
to
ask
the
officers
what
are
you
going
to
do,
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
to
consider
restrictions
that
are
deemed
wise
to
impose
on
the
manner
of
executing
the
search
and
i
think
this
is
true
with
conventional
searches
as
well
as
with
the
title
iii
search.
and
the
existence
of
this
power
it
seems
to
me
elevates
greatly
any
concern
about
the
agents
barging
in.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
we
would
object
if
you’re
doing
it
by
deciding
this
case
against
us,
but
otherwise
we
wouldn’t
object
to
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
we
would
not
object
to
your
expressing
the
view
if
you
felt
so
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case
and
several
others
have
done,
judge
grufein
i
think
did
it
in
the
scaffidi
case.
it’s
a
good
idea.
we
think
it
would
be
prudent
for
the
government
to
do
it,
we
agree.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
don’t
--
we
are
not
clear
that
except
in
the
exercise
of
the
court’s
supervisory
power
over
the
conduct
of
district
judges
granting
title
iii
orders,
it
is
possible
that
the
court
could
say
that
we
want
the
judge
in
issuing
an
order
to
address
themselves
to
this
problem
and
to
put
a
provision
regulating
the
manner
of
entering
into
title
iii
order,
it’s
possible
that
you
could
do
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
the
department’s
policy
to
obtain
an
express
authorization
from
the
court
for
each
entry
that
is
made
to
install
or
to
maintain
or
to
replace.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
it’s
our,
we
are
talking
about
surreptitious
entries
now.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i’m
not
sure
exactly
how
we
do
it,
but
i
think
in
practice
the
judges
are
made
aware
of
how
we
are
planning
to
do
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
but
this
case
was
before
the
adoption
of
the
policy.
we
adopted
the
policy
after
the
dc
circuit’s
decision
in
ford
called
to
our
attention
the
difficulties
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
will
find
it
in
our
brief.
we
discuss
it
in
our
brief
and
i
think
we’d
quote
from
it
at
page
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
page
56
of
our
brief.
okay.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
would
be
very
unhappy
whatsoever
decision,
yes.
thank
you.
