e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
1722,
dalia
against
the
united
states.
mr.
ruprecht,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
you
said
it
could
have
do
you
mean,
physically
they
could
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
would
be
that
it
was
open
in
the
original
entry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
first
would
permit
two
alternatives,
would
it
not,
either
that
it
was
wide
open
or
that
it
was
unlocked
and
easily
open?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
it's
still
a
breaking
and
entry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
--
i
take
that
you
think
even
if
they
got
in
with
opacity
to
a
door,
that
would
still
be
a
break
and
entry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
you
had
a
warrant
with
what
you
have
plus
a
warrant
to
enter
the
premises
by
any
means
possible
for
a
search
in
other
words
a
typical
search
warrant
and
they
went
through
the
usual
procedures
of

identified
themselves
but
no
answer,
no
one
is
in
the
premises
and
then
they
proceed
to
make
an
entry
by
any
process
you
want
to
hypothesize
and
they
look
around
for
papers
and
they
find
some
things
that
they
want
but
also
before
they
leave,
they
install
the
listening
device,
what
would
you
think
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
seizure
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can't
judge
it.
that's
fruits
in
other
words.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can't
judge
the
validity
of
the
search
by
the
fruits.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
think
they
just
have
in
mind
the
directional
microphone
that
would
connect
through
the
window
or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
i
put
that
hypothetical
to
you
before
about
entering
by
force
the
unoccupied
property
and
premises
under
a
warrant,
you
said
they
could
seize
anything
they
found
but
they
couldn't
leave
the
microphone
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
instead
of
leaving
the
microphone,
let's
carry
the
hypothetical
or
perhaps
rather
extensively
and
they
leave
one
of
their
man
who
can
take
short
hand
notes
or
who
has
recording
machine
which
he
can
hold
in
his
hand
or
just
listen
to
any
one
of
those
three.
and
he
hears
the
conversations
and
there
are
buildings
in
which
this
would
not
be
impossible.
the
man
could
do
this
without
being
detected.
what
would
you
say
about
the
information
he
acquires,
is
that
admissible
or
let's
assume--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
say
it's
an
officer
or
warehouse
then
that
will
make
you
anymore
comfortable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
--
what
that
officer
heard
in
a
room
next
to
where
he
was
stationed
could
not
be
admitted
an
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
that
the
government
is
arguing
here
that
the
same
logic
or
the
same
inferences
or
logic
of
unreasonable
under
judge
lacey's
order
is
the
ones
you've
just
been
discussing
with
mr.
justice
white
on
an
arrest
warrant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
like
the
police
you
get
your
man
wherever
you
can
find
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
just
the
case
law
that
has
evolved.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
have
conceded
that
if
you
knocked
at
the
door
with
a
search
warrant
and
there
was
no
answer
and
they
either
knew
or
suspected
there
was
no
one
home,
they
could
validly
break-in
and
make
the
search.
you've
conceded
that
i
think.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
we'll
hear
you
in
the
morning
at
10
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
dalia
against
the
united
states.
mr.
frey
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didnâ€™t
judge
higgin
botham
say
in
his
opinion
something
to
be
effect
that
it
would
be
prudent
to
disclose
to
the
judge
from
whom
the
warrant
is
sought
that
they
take
this
step,
do
this
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
