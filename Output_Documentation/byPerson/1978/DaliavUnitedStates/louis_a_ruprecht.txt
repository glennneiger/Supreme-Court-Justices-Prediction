mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
a
brief
review
of
the
facts
with
be
an
order
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
receiving
offense
and
a
conspiracy
to
receive
goods
in
interstate
commerce
which
had
been
stolen.
the
hijacking
which
formed
the
basis
for
theft
offense
occurred
on
april
3,
1973
and
several
men
were
caught
with
the
stolen
goods
in
their
possession,
the
petitioner
not
included
on
april
5,
1973.
during
this
very
period
of
time,
the
petitioner
had
been
the
subject
and
was
still
being
the
subject
of
a
very
intense
electronic
surveillance
by
the
government
because
on
march
14,
1973,
the
government
had
obtained
a
title
iii
order
from
judge
lacey
in
the
district
of
new
jersey
permitting
the
government
to
intercept
all
telephone
communications
on
two
of
his
business
telephones
in
linden,
new
jersey
and
so
for
20
days
up
until
april
3rd
or
april
4,
1973,
the
government
was
actively
overhearing
these
business
conversations.
at
the
conclusion
of
that
20-day
period,
the
government
came
back
and
obtained
another
order
renewing
for
another
20
days,
the
telephone
tap
on
the
two
business
telephones
but
this
time
also
secured
an
order
permitting
electronic
surveillance
of
office
conversations
that
would
be
taking
place
in
an
enclosed
office
in
the
north
westerly
corner
mr.
dalia's
building.
there
was
nothing
in
that
order
of
authorization
and
nothing
in
the
application
therefore
which
gave
any
hint
as
to
how
the
government
intended
to
install
this
listening
device
if
one
was
to
be
installed.
and
indeed,
judge
lacey
asked
no
questions
on
the
strike
force
attorney
who
made
the
application,
gave
no
informal
information
in
that
regard.
on
the
night
of
april
5,
1973,
three
fbi
agents
opened
the
window
of
the
building,
walked
down
a
corridor
and
in
the
process
of
or
in
a
time
of
about
two
or
three
hours
installed
the
listening
device
in
the
ceiling
of
mr.
dalia's
office.
at
that
point
in
time,
it
was
activated
and
for
20
more
days,
all
office
conversations
were
overheard
and
recorded
as
well
as
the
office
telephones.
on
about
april
27th,
the
government
went
back
and
made
another
application
to
continue
the
electronic
surveillance
and
got
another
20-day
order
for
both
the
office
conversations
as
well
as
the
two
telephones.
the
upshot
of
all
these
was
that
as
a
result
of
the
electronic
surveillance,
there
were
over
5,000
telephone
calls
intercepted
and
recorded
over
a
thousand
separately
designated
office
conversations
overheard
and
recorded
and
over
1,500
tape
real
hours
of
overheard
conversations.
i
bring
this
to
the
court's
attention
because
i
think
it's
significant
when
it
is
coupled
with
the
underlying
complaint
that
the
petitioner
has
with
respect
to
this
case.
and
that
is
the
activity
of
the
government
in
conducting
the
breaking
and
entry
without
any
court
authorization,
without
any
advisement
to
the
court
and
indeed
without
any
statutory
authorization.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
as
far
as
we
know,
that
interception
was
done
probably
at
a
telephone
business
office
which
is
the--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
that
apparently
is
the
usual
routine
on
telephone
interceptions.
in
this
case
however,
the
government
apparently
knew
in
advance
and
when
i
use
the
term,
the
government,
i
mean
the
fbi
agents
and
presumably
the
strike
force
attorney
knew
in
advance
that
a
breaking
and
entry
was
to
be
accomplished.
this
was
not,
however,
passed
on
to
the
court
who
was
overseeing
the
title
iii
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
think
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
that
is
easily
answered
and
i
think
it
is
the
argument
that
the
government
makes
which
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
--
is
most
decently
answered.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
in
this
case,
it
is
easily
conceivable
that
the
government
could
have
affected
electronic
surveillance
by
placing
an
instrument
or
a
recording
device
on
a
window
cell
outside,
on
the
window
itself
that
they
could
have
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
or
even
a
spike
microphone
such
as
it
was
used
in
silverman
against
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
there
has
not
a
record
below
to
show
whether
or
not
that
would
have
been
possible.
what
i
am
suggesting
though
is
certainly
a
judge
looking
at
this
application
would
not
necessarily
have
to
conclude
that
these
officers
are
about
to
commit
a
break
and
an
entry
anymore.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
if
you
put
it
that
way
but
that's
not
the
way
this
was
put.
this
was
not
put
in
the
application
that
we
are
going
to
install
it
in
his
office,
rather
they
asked
for
the
right
to
intercept
the
conversations
which
were
occurring
in
that
office
and
any
judge
who
was
up
on
his
law
dealing
with
electronic
surveillance
would
have
read
silverman
against
the
united
states
and
known
that
their
surveillance
was
accomplished
without
entering
that
petitioner's
office
that
in
goldman
against
the
united
states,
electronic
surveillance
was
accomplished
by
using
a
detective
phone
against
a
party
wall.
and
indeed
in
katz
against
the
united
states,
electronic
surveillance
was
accomplished
without
a
direct
physical
intrusion.
there
was
an
--
a
recording
device
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
that
was
apparently
placed
on
the
outside
of
the
telephone
booth.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
that
is
not
this
case
but
what
i
think
is
important
to
recognize,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
from
intercepting
oral
communications
that
a
break
and
entry
is
the
only
way
to
accomplish
that
result.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
would
suggest
that
yes,
there
would
have
to
be
a
warrant
in
a
goldman
type
of
situation
where
there
is
no
physical
intrusion
clearly
but
still
there
is
an
electronic
acquisition
of
what
would
be
private
conversations.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
that's
exactly
right
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
the
type
of
intrusion
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
peculiarly
sensitive
one.
it's
the
most
intrusive
way,
i
believe
law
enforcement
officers
can
enter
into
one's
life,
that
is
to
physically
commit
a
break
and
entry
into
a
person's
home
or
office.
certainly,
it
is
the
type
of
intrusion
that
is
susceptible
to
the
greatest
abuse.
it's
the
type
of
intrusion
that
for
example
in
this
case
could
have
and
did
result
in
some
type
of
a
search
because
the
officers
in
a
very
limited
evidentiary
hearing,
i
was
permitted
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
three
officers
who
broke
in.
he
admitted
that
the
first
step
was
for
the
officers
to
stand
out
and
search
the
entire
building
for
what
he
termed
and
perhaps
rightfully
saw
safety
reasons.
naturally,
officers
are
going
to
be
concerned
less
there
would
be
someone
else
in
the
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
the
first
entry
was
made
through
what
the
officers
in
an
affidavit
said
was
an
open
window.
by
that,
they
mean
presumably
it
was
open
after
they
opened
it.
the
next
entry
that
was
performed
was
on
may
16th
when
the
listening
device
was
removed
and
there
they
said
they
pried
open
the
window
and
they
indicated
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
it
was
the
same
window
in
both
instances
but
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
in
the
second
instance,
i
know
that
the
window
is
locked
but
that
specifically
was
not
mentioned
in
the
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
that
would
be
--
what
i
would
think
would
be
a
fair
inference
from
the
officers.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
think
that
is
what
the
officer
meant
that
--
what
i
think
he
meant
was
it
was
unlocked
the
first
time
and
therefore
they
opened
it
and
the
second
time,
it
was
locked
in
effect
jimmy
did
open.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
it
--
it
may
have
but
i
don't
think
that
it
would
change
the
circumstance
one
i
ought
to.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
it
would
still
be
a
breaking
and
entry
and
one
thing
that
is
of
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
it
would
still
be
a
break
and
entry
but
there
is
i
think
something
less
repugnant
about
that
and
it
is
less
repugnant
when
an
officer
chooses
to
make
his
entry
for
installation
of
listening
devices
as
done
in
ford
through
a
stratagem
or
rouse
in
that
case
of
a
bomb
scare
or
perhaps
through
the
use
of
an
informant
who
might
be
lawfully
own
the
premises
but
while
they
secrete
a
listening
device,
any
of
these
methods
are
less
intrusive,
less
repugnant,
less
obnoxious
and
something
that
i
believe
are
more
easily
tolerated.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
in
my
view,
the
search
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
and
if
they
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
and
the
seizure
if
they
were
--
if
they
had
a
lawful
search
warrant.
however,
the
installation
of
the
device
and
the
use
of
a
search
warrant
as
a
guise
for
entry
in
order
to
install
listening
devices
i
think
would
be
unsound
and
illegal.
there
is
no
warrant
for
installing
listening
devices
through
the
use
of
a
search
warrant
as
your
mode
of
entry.
a
search
warrant
is
for
a
particular
purpose
to
search
and
seize
property.
i'm
mindful
of
the
recent
case
of
new
york
telephone,
however,
that
was
a
very
limited
type
of
intrusion,
the
use
of
a
pen
register
which
was
permitted
under
this
rule
41
as
i
search.
this
is
something
much
more
to
permit
a
breaking
and
entry
for
the
purpose
of
installing
a
listening
device
is
simply
not
a
search
and
seizure
and
cannot
fairly
be
considered
to
come
within
rule
41
and
so
i
would
suggest
that
would
not
be
appropriate.
the
bottom
line
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
yes,
i
suppose
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
my
use
of
the
term
break
and
entry
really
is
pejorative
and
intentionally
so
i
suppose.
but
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
this
is
a
justified
entry
then
that's
the
end
of
the
use
of
the
term
break
and
entry.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
in
the
fourth
amendment
i
would
suggest
clearly
makes
illegal
what
was
done
in
this
case
because
before
a
police
officer
may
lawfully
break
and
enter
if
we
use
that
term
in
order
to
execute
a
valid
search
warrant,
he
must
have
made
an
appropriate
showing
before
a
magistrate.
there
must
have
been
a
showing
of
necessity
and
he
must
in
advance
of
his
entry
have
been
told
what
he
can
do.
all
of
this
was
missing.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
this
is
clearly
a
fourth
amendment
violation
because
none
of
this
was
present
and
in
fact,
i
think
that
the
brief
of
the
government
almost
conceded
that.
the
government
seems
to
concede
in
its
brief
and
in
fact
at
page
16,
it
indicates
that
lawfulness
should
be
judged
by
subsequent
evaluation
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
agent's
actions.
well,
this
would
fly
in
the
face
of
host
of
fourth
amendment
cases
which
say
that
the
reasonableness
must
be
judged
in
advance,
there
must
be
antecedent.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
exactly
right.
and
there
must
be
direction
to
the
agents
who
are
to
execute
before
they
go
on
their
way.
you
never
look
at
the
search
after
it's
over
and
say,
well,
even
though
they
didn't
get
what
they
should
have
gotten
from
the
magistrate,
they
did
it
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
would
tend
to
agree.
my
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
my
--
my
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
my
fourth
amendment
argument
would
only
come
in
place
if
there
was
first
determination
made
that
the
officers
should
have
gotten
a
search
warrant
because
this
is
a
search.
i
don't
concede
that.
i
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
no,
he
cannot
even
enter.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
there
is
certainly
no
right
on
the
part
of
any
police
officer
to
come
on
to
your
property.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
yes.
and
that
is
one
that
can
be
found
through
implication
in
the
fourth
amendment
that
says
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
homes,
they
have
that
right
and
it
can
only
be
lost
once
in
advance
a
magistrate
gives
them
the
right
to
do
so.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
would
suggest
that
any
case
where
officers
have
fail
to
get
a
search
warrant
in
advance
of
their
entry
and
have
found
the
results
of
that
search
suppressed
stands
for
that
proposition.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
certainly,
it
was
totally
neutral
in
its
terms
with
respect
to
what
the
officers
might
do
and
i
would
use
the
term
deficient
in
this
respect.
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
in
the
abstract
and
i
don't
concede
this
point
that
in
the
abstract,
officers
may
conduct
surreptitious
entries
or
break-in
entries
to
install
listening
devices
then
that
must
be
governed
by
fourth
amendment
standards
and
the
order
permitting
them
to
do
so
must
be
founded
upon
facts
submitted
to
the
magistrate
as
to
the
need
for
this
type
of
entry
and
he
must
stand
direct
exactly
what
they
may
do,
how
many
times
they
may
do
it
and
who
has
the
right
to
do
it.
but
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
from
all
those
fourth
amendment
cases
which
say
there
must
be
particularity
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
no,
rather
from
case
law
that
indicates
that
there
must
be
-particularity
in
the
search
warrant
itself
which
directs
the
executing
officer
as
to
the
location
that
directs
him
as
to
what
is
to
be
seized.
there
must
be
a
particularity.
there
must
be
a
certain
timeframe
over
which
it
must
be
executed
on
and
none
of
this
was
present.
again,
i
don't
mean
by
this
argument
to
suggest
that
i
concede
there
is
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
do
this.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
that
is
correct
and
that
is
the
constitutional
argument
that
a
search
such
as
this
is
inherently
unreasonable.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
that
is
my
suggestion
in
point
two
of
the
brief.
i
think
that
the
constitutional
argument
perhaps
is
unnecessary
to
even
arrive
at
because
the
point
one
in
the
brief
directs
itself
to
the
statutory
interpretation
of
title
iii
and
i
think
that
really,
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
can
at
this
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
well,
3109
really,
i
don't
think
is
all
that
analogous.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
yes.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
yes.
3109
is
simply
a
reflection
of
the
realities
of
the
situation
that
there
aren't
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
that
that's
exactly
right
but
i
don't
see
how
that
can
assist.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
see.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
see.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
it's
exactly
and
certainly
in
something
as
important
as
a
surreptitious
entry
one
would
expect
and
one
ought
to
demand
that
there
would
be
some
specific
legislative
approval
before
that
is
read
into
a
statute.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
title
iii
that
shows
that
the
congress
intended
to
permit
break-ins
and
entries
or
surreptitious
entries
to
install
listening
devices.
the
statute
is
totally
silent
and
the
several
cases
that
have
come
up
involving
this
issue
seem
to
have
only
one
thing
that
they
are
in
agreement
on
and
that
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
title
iii
on
the
issue.
it
seems
to
be
an
important
area
that
congress
simply
decided
not
to
write
in
because
they
are
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
certainly,
i
think
it
should
not
be
written
in.
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
write
in
to
title
iii
a
right
on
the
part
of
law
enforcement
officers
to
conduct
surreptitious
entries
when
the
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
enact
such
a
right.
that
must
come
from
congress
and
congress
has
not
done
so.
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
--
i
think
so
and
i
don't
think
that
a
court
would
have
the
right
to
give
that
to
the
police
--
would
have
the
right
to
say
you
may
commit
break-ins
and
entries.
any
more
than
a
court
would
have
the
right
on
its
own
to
permit
someone
to
conduct
the
break
and
entry
and
not
to
seize
property
but
perhaps
to
look
at
it
and
then
discuss
it
with
police
officers
later
on
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
the
government
would
argue
that
it
is
thereby
necessary
implication
and
i
think
the
response
to
that
is
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
imply
that
only
if
you
say
or
adopt
the
government's
argument
that
this
is
something
so
vital
with
the
law
enforcement
that
things
will
come
to
a
halt
without
it.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
would
agree
with
that.
i'm
sure
that
there
would
be
sometimes
that
the
government
would
be
stymied
that
there
would
be
some
attempts
at
electronic
surveillance
that
would
fail
but
for
a
break-in
and
an
entry.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
certainly,
congress
did
not
put
that
in
writing
and
although
it
was
extremely
explicit
with
respect
to
many
important
items,
it
said
nothing
about
that
and
it's
silent
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
think
not
--
well,
without
the
knowledge,
yes
but
not
necessarily
--
i
would
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
marshall
but
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i'm
sure
that
there
would
be
some
people
who
were
thinking
along
those
lines
but
i
think
that
its
absence
can
only
be
explained
because
there
was
no
consensus
that
would
give
that
kind
of
thing
to
the
drafters
of
the
legislation.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
would
agree.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
again,
i
would
think
not.
the
--
the
stationing
of
the
police
officer
secretly
in
houses
perhaps
the
one
intrusion
that
is
even
worst
than
the
break-in
and
entry.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
--
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
any
warrant
for
that.
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
any
right
on
the
part
of
the
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
no,
i
think
there
had
been
indications
that
indicate
3109
is
really
a
codification
of
common
law
principles
and
these
exceptions
of
exigency
developed
through
the
common
law
in
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
yes,
i
believe
the
cases
are
that
he
can
forcibly
enter.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
think
that
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
think
probably
because
the
execution
of
an
arrest
warrant
is
something
that
is
so
fleeting
in
time,
so
brief
and
demands
the
presence
of
the
person
in
order
to
even
be
affected.
there
simply
is
not
the
danger
that
is
associated
with
a
search
warrant
or
in
this
case
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
yes.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
yes.
and
i
think
that
the
only
explanation
for
that
is
because
the
nature
of
that
intrusion
associated
with
an
arrest
is
necessarily
less
or
usually
less
than
that
associated
with
a
search
and
especially
that
associated
with
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
yes,
that
so
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
except
what
the
government
seems
to
concede
is
that
there
is
some
type
of
fourth
amendment
protection
surrounding
this
and
yet
the
government
would
also
have
to
concede
that
fourth
amendment
protections
were
not
available
here
with
respect
to
the
entry
because
there
was
never
any
type
of
antecedent
justification
of
the
entry.
there
was
never
a
record
made
before
judge
lacey
as
to
why
this
was
necessary
and
indeed
judge
lacey's
so-called
finding
some
four
years
or
almost
four
years
after
the
fact
in
his
opinion
that
a
break-in
entry
was
the
safest
and
most
expeditious
way
of
conducting
this
electronic
surveillance
is
briefed
of
any
factual
support
because
there
was
never
even
during
the
evidentiary
hearings
any
testimony
that
showed
this
was
necessary.
there
was
never
a
showing
that
there
was
true
exigency
in
the
sense
that
a
place
had
to
be
broken
into
for
implanting
electronic
listening
device.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
yes,
i
believe
that's
true.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
yes,
on
search
warrants,
i
don't
think
3109
really
added
anything
that
was
not
already
there.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
under
some
circumstance
if
he
was
faced
with
a
situation
of
imminent
distraction
of
evidence,
he
would
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
not
in
3109
but
there
is
another
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
think
not.
3109
is
security
statute
and
that
it
has
been
interpreting
--
interpreted
well
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
not
without
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
that's
correct.
they
don't
use
the
term.
they
rather
talk
in
terms
of
a
threat
to
the
officer's
safety
and
there
is
another
provision
in
there
but
they
don't
use
the
term
exigent
circumstances
and
yet
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
i
think
the
fleeing
of
a
suspect
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
yes.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
if
i
may
just
refer
--
mr.
louis
a.
ruprecht
because
in
the
rules
of
federal
criminal
procedure,
we
have
rule
41
which
authorizes
search
warrants
and
that
is
the
authority
for
issuing
them
but
there
is
no
authority
anywhere
for
issuing
warrants
to
commit
break-ins
to
install
listening
devices.
