paul

how
about
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
talking
about
the
limitation
but
if
you
can
read
it
both,
there's
a
limitation
on
the
method
of
executing
a
warrant
and
also
as
authority
to
break-in
which
might
not
otherwise
exist.
but
i
think
that
you
take
the
position
that
even
apart
from
3109,
the
officer
would
have
the
authority
to
conduct
a
break-in
in
order
to
execute
a
search
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,no.
no,
you
don't
--
there
is
no
requirement
of
imminent
distraction
of
evidence
in
3109.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
asking
you.
did
3109
enlarge
the
authority
of
the
federal
officer
in
any
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
at
3109
they
could
have
broken
without
the
exigent
circumstance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there's
nothing
in
3109
that
requires
exigency.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
nothing
about
threat
to
the
officer's
safety
in
here
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
the
only
thing
is
they
don't
open
the
door.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
3109
added
to
the
authority
of
the
federal
officer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
true,
well
then
why
do
you
need
a
statute.
you
made
a
big
argument
in
your
brief
about
needing
statutory
authority
for
this
break-in.
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey
you
described
what
the
practical
situation
is
today.
how
much
of
that
was
explained
to
congress
during
the
hearings
on
title
iii?
justice
john
paul
stevens
senate
report
doesn’t
mention
that
subject
at
all.
it
does
mention
the
cases
in
which
the
spike
mic
was
used
and
some
of
the
other
cases
where
there
was
no
entry,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
senate
report
that
i
could
see
where
they
discussed
anything
like
what
you’ve
just
described.
you
do
and
i’m
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
are
references
in
the
hearings
that
you
described.
justice
john
paul
stevens
many
of
those
references
indicate
that
that
even
a
majority
of
the
cases
there
would
be
need
for
a
surreptitious
entry.
they
do
refer
to
the
need
on
occasion,
but
they
also
cite
cases
which
indicate
that
frequently
it
could
have
been
done
without
a
surreptitious
entry.
so
how
do,
as
i’m
just
wondering
what
the
state
of
knowledge
of
the
congress
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
does
it
--
does
that
evidence
in
the
senate
report
also
go
to
the
point
of
surreptitious
entry,
that’s
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
the
point
that
interested
me
was
that
the
senate
report
relies
very
heavily
on
this
court’s
previously
decided
cases,
which
included
the
use
of
a
mic
on
the
outside
of
a
telephone
booth
and
the
spike
mic.
well
they
may
not
have
focused
on
this
problem
is
all
i’m
suggesting
because
of
the
emphasis
on
the
cases
from
this
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
but
just
before
we
leave
with
that,
because
that
doesn’t
mention
the
surreptitious
entry
and
i
was
wondering
in
berger
itself,
i
know
it
was
listening
device
in
an
office,
but
does
the
record
in
that
case
tell
us
whether
it
was
just
installed
surreptitiously
or
by
rules.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can’t
tell
from
the
opinion,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
that
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
that
congress
knew
that
the
device
had
been
installed
surreptitiously
as
opposed
to
by
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
not
aware
of
anything.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
excuse
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
view
the
statute
as
enlarging
the
officer’s
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
goes
to
question
of
whether
there
might
be
need
for
statutory
authorization
that’s
the
only
relevance
of
it
and
i’m
not
expressing
a
view
on
it,
but
