what
about
the
arrest
warrant
if
you
want
to
talk
about
the
common
law?
here's
a
warrant
for
arrest
of
specific
person
because
there's
this
probably
cause
that
believe
he
has
committed
a
crime
and
the
officer
finds
that
he's
in
his
house
and
may
he
break
in
without
any
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
may
he
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
nothing
in
the
warrant
that
indicates
that
he
may
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you
could
always
say
that
it
haven't
boil
your
plate
in
the
search
warrant
and
say
if
it's
necessary
to
break
into
the
house,
break
into
a
house
but
it's
never
been
required.
if
the
officer
finds
on
the
spot
that
it's
necessary
to
break-in
to
execute
the
warrant,
he
may
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
case
of
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
the
search
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
announce
your
authority
and
you
get
no
response,
you
can
break-in.
