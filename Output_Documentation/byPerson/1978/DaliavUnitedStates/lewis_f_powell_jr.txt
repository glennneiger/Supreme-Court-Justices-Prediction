you

as

in
the
part

of
your
brief
that
even
if
the
congress
had
specifically
authorized
this
conduct
that
it
would
be
invalid.

that
congress
could
never
authorize
it.
justice
lewis

powell,

the
second
case
77-1722,
dalia
against
the
united
states
is
before
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
court's
consistent
with
the
constitution
and
with
title
iii
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968
may
approve
covert
entries
onto
private
premises
for
the
purpose
of
installing
electronic
eavesdropping
equipment.
petitioner,
dalia,
was
convicted
of
conspiracy
and
receiving
stolen
goods.
the
incriminating
evidence
was
obtained
largely
from
an
electronic
bug
planted
in
the
ceiling
of
his
office
by
fbi
agents
who
secretly
entered
and
installed
the
device.
in
the
courts
below,
petitioner
contended
as
he
does
here
that
this
evidence
was
inadmissible
because
the
law
enforcement
officers
acted
unlawfully
and
thus
entering
his
office.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
rejected
petitioner's
argument.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
agree
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
we
conclude
first
that
congress
in
title
iii
granted
court's
the
power
in
certain
circumstances
to
authorize
surreptitious
entries
for
the
purpose
of
installing
electronic
surveillance
equipment.
we
agree
with
the
courts
below
that
the
district
court's
order
authorizing
the
surveillance
of
petitioner's
conversations
a
valid
order
under
title
iii,
implicitly
and
necessarily
also
authorized
the
secret
entry
to
install
the
bug.
we
hold
further
that
the
fourth
amendment
neither
forbids
such
entries
per
se
nor
requires
explicit
rather
than
implicit
judicial
approval
of
the
entry
and
of
the
exact
means
of
installing
the
bug.
mr.
justice
brennan

opinion
concurring
in
part

dissenting
in
part
in
which
mr.
justice
stewart
joins
except
as
to
part
i.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion

which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall

joined.
