justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
the
court
not
know
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
trespass?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
else
can
you
get
in
person's
office
except
by
trespass?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
believe
in
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
cell
microphone?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
you
assume
that
if
you
told
the
average
person,
i
am
going
to
put
something
in
joe
glock's
office
which
he
will
not
know
is
there
that
every
person
would
realize
that
there
was
about
to
be
a
trespass.
justice
thurgood
marshall
into
the
telephone--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
answer
my
brother
rehnquist.
but
i
still
don't
see
how
you
get
a
search
out
of
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
don't
get
a
search,
how
do
you
get
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
don't
get
the
fourth
amendment,
how
do
you
get
the
objection
of
breaking
and
entry?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
if
it's
not
a
search,
he
doesn't
need
a
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
provisional
guides
did
you
said
that
officer
can't
enter
without
knocking?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
right
that
prevents
him
from
any
right
of
an
individual
and
it
prevents
the
police
officer
from
breaking
his
door
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
got
a
case
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
you
characterize
judge
lacey's
order?
what
label
would
you
put
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
--
where
do
you
draw
--
from
where
do
you
draw
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
from
a
statute
though.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
congress
assume
that
should
be
done
without
the
knowledge
of
the
person
involved?
justice
thurgood
marshall
[inaudible]
what
the
man
is
going
to
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
about
the
statutory
point,
what
would
be
wrong
with
the
judge
asking
how
are
you
going
about
this,
are
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
knock
the
man’s
door
down
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
going
to
knock
the
man’s
door
down?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
requiring
the
judge
to
do
that,
to
just
see
how
far
you
are
going?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
yeah
and
judge
didn’t
say
anything
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
suggesting
that
he
be
required
to
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
wouldn’t
object
to
them,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
maybe
alright
to
put
it
in
a
foot
note?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
said
[inaudible]
the
rule.
but
now
the
present
rule
is
that
you
do
explain
to
the
jury.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
misunderstood,
i
thought
you
said
it
was
the
rule
of
the
department?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
no
requirement
that
they
tell
this
court
how
they
are
going
to
make
the
entry.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
wasn’t
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
will
not
find
it
obviously.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
missed
it.
