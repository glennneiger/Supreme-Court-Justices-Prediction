justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
in
silverman
and
katz
and
in
goldman
which
is
now
i
think
been
overruled,
the
present
rule
of
this
court
would
be
that
you
would
need
a
warrant
for
any
of
that
kind
of
thing,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
you're
seeking
to
protect
against
here
by
your
argument
is
not
the
constitutional
evasion
of
privacy
but
simply
the
intrusion
on
the
property
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
used
the
term
breaking
and
entry
several
times.
is
that
solely
a
question
to
be
determined
by
state
property
law?
it
occurs
to
me
that
for
instance
an
officer
conceivably
could
break
and
enter
and
search
and
sieze
and
if
the
court
were
to
find
exit
in
circumstances,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
violation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
prohibits
breaking
and
entering
as
such.
you
have
the
fourth
amendment
that
protects
unreasonable
searches
and
seizure
--
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
this
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
simplicity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ruprecht,
the
moment
ago,
you
answered
my
brother
brennan's
question
about
section
3109
being
a
limitation
on
the
authority
of
a
law
enforcement
officer
to
execute
a
search
warrant.
i
take
it
if
that
were
not
present
or
an
officer
could
break
and
enter
in
order
to
serve
a
search
warrant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
what
if
in
the
course
of
execution
of
a
warrant
such
was
upheld
by
the
third
circuit
here,
an
officer
would
have
wandered
into
the
bed
and
then
go
through
the
dressers,
drawers
and
finds
some
stuff
and
there
and
seek
to
later
offer
that
in
evidence.
do
you
think
that
would
be
admissible?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
we
heard
a
case
yesterday
argued
i
don’t
know
whether
you
were
here
or
not
saying
in
which
the
criminal
defendants
claimed
that
violation
of
a
regulation
issued
by
an
executive
department
required
exclusion
of
evidence
even
though
neither
the
constitution
or
the
statute
required
it.
i
take
it
you’re
not
suggesting
that
you’d
be
satisfied
with
a
decision
by
this
court
saying
that
a
departure
from
departmental
policy
that
you
have
referred
to
would
require
exclusion.
