mr.
craig
a.
christensen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
suit
filed
by
the
petitioner
in
the
bankruptcy
court
seeking
a
determination
that
a
debt
owed
him
the
respondent
and
evidenced
by
a
decree
bankruptcy
state
court
judgment
was
not
dischargeable
base
upon
section
17a
(2)
and
17a
(4)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
bankruptcy
court
grant
summary
judgment
for
the
respondent
determining
the
debt
to
be
dischargeable
and
that
order
was
affirmed
by
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
facts
upon
which
that
summary
judgment
was
entered
are
as
follows.
in
june
1975,
jefferson
bank
and
trust
company
began
an
action
against
the
respondent,
mr.
felsen,
his
company,
le
mans
motors
and
the
petitioner,
garvin
brown.
the
bank's
claim
against
the
respondent
was
premised
upon
a
promissory
note
he
had
executed.
the
bank's
claim
against
mr.
brown,
the
petitioner,
was
premised
upon
a
guarantee
of
that
note
he
had
executed
in
favor
of
the
bank.
mr.
brown
filed
a
cross-claim
against
mr.
felsen
based
upon
indemnity.
no
claims
of
fraud
were
pled
in
the
state
court
action
by
mr.
brown
against
the
respondent.
shortly
after
the
respondent's
deposition,
the
parties
all
stipulated
to
judgment.
mr.
brown
stipulated
the
entry
of
judgment
in
favor
of
the
bank
and
against
him.
the
respondent
stipulated
to
the
entry
of
judgment
in
a
like
amount
in
favor
of
mr.
brown
and
against
the
respondent.
the
state
court
entered
judgment
based
upon
that
stipulation.
no
evidentiary
record
was
made.
thereafter,
the
respondent
filed
his
petition
in
bankruptcy
and
mr.
brown
commenced
an
adversary
proceeding
to
have
it
determined
that
the
debt
owed
him
by
the
respondent
was
not
dischargeable.
mr.
felsen
moved
for
summary
judgment
contending
that
despite
the
obligation
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
determine
dischargeability
since
no
fraud
had
been
pled
in
the
state
court
action,
the
bankruptcy
court
could
not
go
beyond
that
record.
it
been
res
judicata
and
the
debt
would
have
to
be
termed
dischargeable
in
the
absence
of
that
fraud
finding.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
in
the
state
court,
your
honor?
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
mr.
brown,
i
don't
believe
that
he
had
filed
a
claim.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
no,
i
don't
believe
he
have
to
by
virtue
of
the
adversary
proceeding
because
the
court
is
bound
there
to
enter
judgment.
the
claim
would
only
go
into
his
rights
to
distribution
from
the
state
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
--
that
was
eventual
rights
to
collect
it.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
thus,
well,
he
wouldn't
be
included
in
the
distribution,
mr.
justice.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
he
would
not
share
in
the
distribution
from
the
estate.
same
with
the
secured
credit
he
may
ought
not
to
file
a
claim
for
the
deficiency
but
it
doesn't
relate
to
his
rights
between
he
and
the
debtor
with
regard
to
the
security
and
i'm
talking
from
recollection.
i'm
not
sure
perhaps
the
claim
was
filed
in
this
matter.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
the
bankruptcy
court?
section
17c
provides
that
the
creditor
who
wants
to
seek
a
determination
of
nondischargeability
must
file
and
that
filing
wasn't
made
on
a
timely
basis.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
no.
not
--
you
would
have
to
share
in
distributions
from
the
estate
but
not
to
retain
a
nondischargeable
claim
to
be
collected
from
post
bankruptcy
assets.
in
any
event,
if
that
were
important
i'd
want
to
supplement
the
record.
i
just
don't
recall
whether
a
claim
was
filed
that
believe
it
was.
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
yes,
it
comes
up
but
i
think
under
17c
under
u.s.c.
under
1254
for
review
of
the
bankruptcy
determinations.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
ought
to
be
vacated
and
petitioner
allowed
to
proceed
on
this
complaint.
i
submit
that
for
three
reasons.
number
one,
the
1970
amendment
to
section
17
of
the
bankruptcy
act
plays
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
section
(a)
(2)
and
(a)
(4)
determinations
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
so
that
reliance
for
this
determination
on
the
wording
of
a
judgment
issued
by
a
prior
court
without
this
jurisdiction
is
a
misplaced
reliance.
second,
the
bankruptcy
act
is
a
federal
statute.
it
requires
a
uniform
nationwide
interpretation
with
respect
to
this
fresh
start
provisions.
and
it
ought
not
to
have
the
fresh
start
for
dischargeability
provisions
dependent
upon
the
various
standards
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
that's
correct.
i
would
say
that
collateral
estoppel,
i'd
say
two
things.
first
of
all,
dischargeability
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
that's
right.
to
the
extent
80
facts
had
been
actually
litigated
by
the
parties
and
actually
determined
those
facts
would
be
binding.
the
bankruptcy
court
would
consider
those
facts
with
any
other
facts
that
the
parties
would
which
to
put
before
the
court
and
weigh
the
facts
against
the
federal
standard
which
is
made
applicable
by
17a
(2)
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
well,
there
would
be
no
res
judicata
because
the
claims
aren't
the
same.
state
fraud
is
not
the
same
as
the
grounds
for
dischargeability
in
the
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
that
i
don't
believe
you
have
to
reach
that
point.
well,
i
might
be
instructive.
this
is
a
case
in
which
no
evidentiary
record
was
made.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
that's
correct.
the
third
reason
that
i
have
for
asking
this
court
to
vacate
the
tenth
circuit
rule
is
that
that
rule
established
by
the
tenth
circuit
will
discourage
settlements
and
it
will
force
unnecessary
litigation
on
already
crowded
courts?
so
that
a
creditor
might
preserve
his
federal
rights
under
section
17
of
the
bankruptcy
act
from
laws
from
the
failure
to
assert
a
prior
state
court
remedy
reviving
in
another
form,
the
very
abuse
that
congress
meant
to
cure
by
passing
the
1970
amendments.
previously,
the
two
step
process
worked
in
reversed
in
which
a
debtor
might
seek
the
protection
of
bankruptcy
court
and
be
granted
as
discharged.
a
creditor
could
then
go
to
state
court
and
seek
to
obtain
a
finding
of
nondischargeability.
the
discharged
being
in
the
nature
of
affirmative
defense,
a
default
judgment
might
have
been
entered
against
the
debtor.
he
relying
under
mistaken
assumption
that
his
discharged
was
automatic
and
need
not
to
be
pled.
congress
pointed
out
in
the
legislative
history
which
is
cited
to
the
court
in
our
brief
that
it
wished
to
instead,
plays
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
now
presumably,
the
creditor
may
go
to
the
state
courts
before
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
seek
a
judgment
necessarily
in
under
the
tenth
circuit
rule
that
will
include
findings
of
fraud.
presumably,
if
those
findings
are
entered,
the
converse
of
the
tenth
circuit
rule
will
be
true
and
it
will
binding
upon
the
bankrupt.
as
i
say,
reviving
in
but
the
converse,
the
very
abuse
which
congress
meant
to
cure.
i
listen
with
interest
as
mr.
justice
stevens
announce
the
ruling
in
a
bankruptcy
court
this
case
morning.
i've
not
read
that
opinion
obviously
but
i
understood
mr.
justice
stevens
to
state
that
the
court's
reasoning
was
at
the
application
of
state
law
on
that
particular
case
was
going
to
be
mandated
because
there
was
no
applicable
federal
standard
for
the
matter
and
that
it
was
more
properly
the
function
of
the
state
courts
to
determine
rights
in
that
particular
instance.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
the
same
reasoning
applied
to
this
case
would
require
the
vacation
of
the
tenth
circuit
rule.
there
are
specific
applicable
federal
standards
in
this
case.
they
are
contained
in
section
17a
of
the
bankruptcy
act
as
to
which
debts
are
dischargeable
and
which
are
not
more
importantly
with
respect
to
the
second
reason.
here
congress
in
section
17c
of
the
bankruptcy
act
which
remains
fundamentally
unchanged
in
the
new
act
to
take
effect
this
october
plays
exclusive
jurisdiction
for
two
kinds
at
least.
section
17a
(2)
and
17a
(4)
claims
were
dischargeability
determination
in
the
bankruptcy
court
removing
that
jurisdiction
from
the
state
courts.
it
seems
to
me
that
creditors
ought
not
to
be
encouraged
to
go
into
the
state
courts
prior
to
a
bankruptcy
seeking
default
judgment
base
upon
fraud.
nor
should
state
courts
be
forced
to
try
issues
which
are
not
necessary
to
the
rendition
of
judgments
on
commercial
paper
in
order
that
a
creditor
may
preserve
his
rights
to
later
raise
the
federal
right
for
a
determination
of
dischargeability.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
absolutely
true,
your
honor.
absolutely
true.
especially,
if
the
fraud
to
be
maintained
is
a
false
financial
statement
that
perhaps
only
materializes
later
but
even
if
known
at
the
time.
the
remedy
to
be
afforded
by
the
state
court
is
going
to
be
identical.
it's
going
to
be
the
same
amount
unless
you
want
to
establish
the
situation
where
you
force
the
creditor
to
seek
punitive
damages
or
some
other
extraordinary
judicial
remedy
because
of
the
fraud.
i
--
i
think
that
perhaps
some
clemency
if
you
will
on
the
part
of
the
creditor
that
is
of
raising
only
the
issues
that
are
necessary
to
his
judgment
on
the
commercial
paper.
it
would
be
the
more
expedient,
the
more
orderly
course
of
action.
i
do
not
think
that
it
ought
to
be
made
mandatory
that
a
creditor
assert
a
state
right
at
one
point
in
the
proceedings
when
he
does
not
even
know
that
there
may
or
will
be
a
bankruptcy.
in
order
to
preserve
a
federal
right
at
a
later
stage
by
analogy,
one
might
suggest
that
had
mr.
brown
in
this
case
receive
stock
from
mr.
felsen.
that's
consideration
for
his
executing
the
guarantee,
would
he
have
equally
been
compelled
to
raise
questions
of
fraud
in
the
delivery
of
the
or
obtaining
of
the
stock
for
the
guarantee
in
the
state
court
in
order
to
preserve
his
remedies
under
the
securities
acts
for
those
claims
upon
which
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
given
to
the
federal
district
courts.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
no.
i
think
had
there
been
no
state
court
litigation.
there
had
been
no
judgment
for
the
state,
the
bankruptcy
court
to
refer
to.
i
would
agree
they're
talking
in
terms
of
what
had
been
litigated.
however,
it's
interesting
that
in
the
two
tenth
circuit
cases
both
reilly
and
this
case,
there
was
no
litigation
if
you
will.
one
is
a
default
judgment.
one
is
a
stipulated
judgment.
the
respondents
suggest
that
perhaps
the
petition
in
this
case
could
have
asked
the
respondent
to
stipulate
as
to
its
nondischargeability.
however,
i
don't
think
that's
a
remedy
available
to
a
creditor.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
that
is
correct.
i
understand
that.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
in
either
of
the
case
of
a
default
judgment
or
stipulated
judgment
that
there
had
been
any
issues
litigated
between
the
parties
which
bear
on
a
federal
right
under
section
17.
they
certainly
established
whether
or
not
a
debt
is
due
on
owing
from
one
party
to
another.
i
don't
think
they
established
the
federal
character
of
that
debt.
for
those
reasons
and
for
the
reason
cited
in
our
brief,
the
petitioner
would
ask
at
this
court
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
and
allow
the
petitioner
to
proceed
upon
his
complaint
in
the
bankruptcy
case.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
very
briefly
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
mr.
keller
suggest
that
the
word
“exclusive
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
under
section
17
does
not
appear
in
the
statute.
that
is
true
but
i
would
cite
to
the
court
section
17c
(2)
which
is
mandatory
to
a
creditor.
it
says
the
creditor
who
contends
that
his
debt
is
not
discharge
under
clause
2
4
or
8
of
subdivision
(a)
and
we're
dealing
here
only
with
sections
2
and
4
must
file
an
application
for
determination
of
dischargeability
within
the
time
fixed
by
the
court.
then
it
goes
on
subsection
3
in
requires
that
court
to
hold
a
hearing
upon
notice
and
to
determine
dischargeability.
really
don't
think
that
there's
much
dispute
that
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
for
the
determination
of
this
type
of
dischargeability
lies
is
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
that
--
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
if
the
issue
had
been
determined
against
the
debtor?
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
yes.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
no.
i
think
there
would
be
collateral
estoppel
if
it's
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
was
determined
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
that's
correct.
and
that
the
--
in
the
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction,
the
facts
that
had
been
previously
determined
and
litigation
would
be
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
i
understand
that
contention.
i
would
disagree
with
that
contention
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
i
don't
believe
that
those
issues
ever
were
raised
or
litigated
in
the
state
courts.
so
to
those
facts
whoever
found
his
not
contending
the
facts
were
found
adverse
to
my
client?
he
is
contending
my
client
waived
its
right
to
ever
have
those
facts
determined.
that's
really
the
issue
before
the
court.
whether
my
client
waived
the
federal
right
by
failing
to
pursue
a
state
right
and
i
believe
that
the
best
analogy
i
can
suggests
to
the
court
is
had
mr.
brown
received
stock
and
the
same
pleadings
would
have
filed
in
the
state
court,
would
he
have
waive
all
of
his
rights
to
any
securities
law
violations
for
which
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
placed
in
the
federal
district
courts?
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
and
if
it's
actually
litigated
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
--
i
think
those
facts
are
binding.
if
it's
by
default
judgment
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
yes.
the
ninth
circuit
has
dealt
with
that
and
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
well,
the
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
i
think
that
the
--
if
it
actually
been
litigated.
it
would
re-determine
to
the
extend
that
the
facts
found
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
--
don't
reach
the
standards
of
section
17.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
yes.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
not
the
legal
test.
that's
correct.
the
facts
found
if
there
were
--
if
the
facts
were
found
that
a
material
misrepresentation
is
made.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
that
fact
would
be
binding
but
the
state
court
determination
of
fraud
under
its
states
standards
of
pleading
requirements
would
not
bind
the
federal
court's
determination
of
federal
law
for
dischargeability.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
i
believe
that
there
had
been
five
since
the
1970
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
--
amendments
that
have
reach
the
circuits.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
i
believe
that
three
--
four
of
the
five
circuits
to
reach
the
question
have
allowed
the
bankruptcy
court
to
consider
it
the
matter
again
with
extrinsic
evidence.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
the
standard
applied
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
i
don't
know
that
either
courts
have
ever
addressed
that
question.
they
always
talk
in
terms
of
the
federal
act
and
but
they
never
states
specifically
whether
that
federal
act
is
being
interpreted
in
the
light
of
states
standards
or
not
mr.
justice
white.
the
closest
indication
would
come
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
the
hultman
case.
there
fraud
was
actually
litigated
and
determined
to
exist
and
the
debtor
went
into
bankruptcy
court.
the
creditor
presented
that
case
and
the
ninth
circuit
said,
no,
that
maybe
prima
facie
but
it's
not
going
to
be
the
standard
of
exclusive.
we're
going
to
let
the
debtor
raise
additional
evidence?
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
i
think
it's
suppose
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
yes.
that
the
closest
to
give
question
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
--
that
i
can
think
of?
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
the
fifth
is
the
tenth
circuit.
that's
this
case.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
so
it
is
contrary.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
the
colorado
rule
of
procedure.
i
think
two
observations
are
necessary
there
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
i
must
concede
to
this
court
that
the
cross-claim
itself
does
not
ask
for
any
relief
base
specifically
on
fraud
and
it
does
not
asked
for
the
extraordinary
type
of
remedy
of
punitive
damages
are
body
execution
that
might
be
available
for
fraud,
so
where
the
case
turning
solely
on
whether
fraud
had
been
plead
in
accordance
with
that
rule.
i'm
not
certain
that
absolutely
has
been.
i
believe
it
has.
it
talks
in
terms
of
misrepresentation
and
identifies
the
misrepresenting
parties.
it
states
that
the
facts
from
material
and
i
think
the
implication
although
not
stated
is
that
there
was
reliance
or
the
guarantee
would
have
been
executed.
but
the
second
more
important
thing
is
i
don't
think
that
federal
rights
ought
the
turn
on
the
various
50
standards
in
the
states
for
fraud
and
their
pleading
requirements.
i
don't
think
that
the
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
because
i
think
the
fresh
start
provisions
are
probably
the
most
essential
ingredient
to
bankrupt.
if
he
doesn't
obtain
the
first
start,
there's
little
or
no
benefit
for
him
to
seek
to
protection
of
the
act
and
to
make
those
first
start
provisions
turn
upon
where
he
has
his
residence
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
absolutely.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
would
be
bind
in
fact
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
that
was
correct.
because
i
--
as
i
understand
the
collateral
estoppel
will
only
go
to
facts
found.
res
judicata
goes
to
the
identicality
of
the
legal
issues
in
--
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
that's
correct
because
the
legal
standards
may
be
different.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
i
think
that's
correct.
that
if
the
facts
have
been
litigated,
i
believe
the
parties
have
to
live
with
them
but
to
the
extent
that
the
legal
standards
are
different.
the
bankruptcy
court
has
a
federal
obligation
to
apply
its
own
standards.
obviously
mr.
justice
white,
it
does
beg
the
question
to
assume
that
those
will
be
national
standards
instead
of
states
standards.
that
is
one
of
the
questions
this
court
must
decide.
but
i
would
argue
that
the
better
rule
is
to
allow
the
parties
to
be
bound
by
the
facts
and
to
allow
the
bankruptcy
court
to
make
this
separate
legal
determination.
otherwise
you
force
the
creditors
in
every
single
case
to
plead
and
prove
or
otherwise
dispose
of
fraud
just
to
preserve
a
federal
right
for
those
few
cases
in
which
bankruptcy
actually
happens.
and
for
that
reason,
i'd
ask
that
this
court
vacate
the
tenth
circuit
judgment
and
allow
the
petitioner
to
proceed.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
it
is
cited
in
the
brief,
mr.
justice
white,
the
legislative
history.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
i'm
sorry?
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
i
think
that
in
the
brief
at
page
7.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
it
talks
--
it
talks
about
exclusive
jurisdiction
at
the
very
top
where
we
cite
the
senate
house
reports.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
with
respect
to
the
federal
as
oppose
to
state
standard,
no.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
makes
that
definitive
statement
as
it
does
about
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
well,
i
think
it
does
because
i
think
not
a
collateral
estoppel
but
a
res
judicata,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
finding
if
the
first
court
had
not
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
if
congress
intended
and
did
in
fact
as
they
state
put
an
exclusive
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
i
don't
think
res
judicata
would
apply.
the
colorado
courts
and
we've
cited
these
cases
in
our
brief
have
specifically
said
they
lack
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
determine
dischargeability
issues.
mr.
craig
a.
christensen
that's
correct.
i
think
it
would
be
applicable
in
the
pre-bankruptcy
if
you
pled
your
case
in
terms
of
a
federal
dischargeability
instead
of
a
state
remedy
for
which
they
have
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
