justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
bankrupt
list
him
as
a
debtor,
he's
going
to
be
included
anyway?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
don't
have
to
decide
here
any
possible
instances
on
which
a
bankruptcy
court
might
in
pursuing
this
authority
given
out
of
70
amendments,
treat
factual
adjudication
in
state
court
is
binding
on
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
presume
that
the
holder
of
a
promissory
note
against
a
solvent
signor
of
it
has
no
particular
interest
in
getting
a
judgment
based
on
fraud,
if
he
can
simply
get
a
judgment
on
the
note?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
think
that
tenth
circuit
would
come
out
the
same
as
there
been
no
state
court
litigation?
i
read
their
opinion
as
holding
more
the
idea
that
--
what
--
anything
that
was
litigated
or
might
have
been
litigated
in
the
state
court
is
binding
on
the
bankruptcy
court.
not
that
you
have
to
go
to
state
court
to
litigate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
some
of
the
most
successful
litigators
specialized
in
default
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
keller,
all
of
the
cross-claim
by
brown
against
felsen
appears
at
page
38
of
the
appendix?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there
as
i
read
it.
there
is
no
mention
of
a
liability
based
on
fraud?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
what
the
tenth
circuit
is
saying
in
effect
is
that,
if
brown
did
not
affirmatively
cross-claim
against
felsen
in
the
state
court
base
on
fraud,
the
bankruptcy
court
cannot
exercise
its
power
under
the
70
amendments
to
decide
independently
or
de
novo
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
whether
or
not
that
particular
debt
was
obtained
by
fraud.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
issue?
that
the
issue
was
never
raised?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
the
issue
will
--
typically,
the
creditor
going
against
the
debtor
or
guarantor
going
against
the
personal
be
guaranteed
if
he
feels
the
person
be
guaranteed
is
solvent,
just
wants
a
judgment.
he
doesn't
care
whether
its
base
on
contract
or
fraud
or
something
else
and
the
fact
that
he
fails
to
urge
the
ground
of
fraud
would
not
ordinary
be
thought
of
it
as
a
waiver
in
some
subsequent
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
on
--
that's
only
if
you
can
say,
it's
a
classical
res
judicata
is
applicable
and
that
anything
that
was
litigated
or
might
have
been
litigated
as
foreclose,
isn't
that
true?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
rather
stringent
standard
to
apply
in
view
of
the
70
amendments,
the
bankruptcy
act,
don't
you
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
state
court
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
and
certainly,
you
concede
if
a
issue
of
fraud
had
been
fully
litigated
that
there
would
be
a
collateral
estoppel
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
would
have
to
be
on
the
basis
of
a
different
legal
standard
not
on
the
over
turning
of
the
factual
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
post-bankruptcy
determination.
