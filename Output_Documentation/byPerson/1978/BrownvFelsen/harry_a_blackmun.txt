did
he
file
the
claim?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
in
the
bankruptcy
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
what
if
the
issue
had
been
raised
in
the
state
litigation.
there
have
been
allegations
of
fraud
under
colorado
and
actually
colorado
law,
and
there
had
been
some
determinations
that
way.
i
suppose
you
take
the
same
position
that
fraud
is
a
federal
concept
would
have
to
be
re-litigated.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
mr.
keller
is
it
not
true
that
pleading
fraud
would
not
have
done
the
guarantor
any
good
in
the
state
court
action.
either
i
guess
the
guarantor
is
only
solvent
party
in
the
state
court
proceeding?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
see.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
is
unlikely?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
right.
you're
position
now
is
that
although
it's
mentioned
in
the
cross
complaint,
it
is
improperly
pled?
is
that
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it's
incorporated
by
reference
whatever
he
said
in
the

in
the
answer.
but
he
says
not
properly
plead.
