justice
byron
r.
white
would
he
have
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
--
you
say
you're
suggesting
that
however
that
he
doesn't
have
to
--
have
been
determine
to
be
a
creditor
by
filing
a
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
just
--
i
just
--
i
was
asking
this
what
the
jurisdiction
--
justice
byron
r.
white
except
on
facts?
you'd
say
just
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
any
such
a
thing
as
res
judicata
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
fundamental
to
your
case
up
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
--
except
your
exertion
the
way
you
made
it,
it
is
broad
enough
to
cover
those
situations?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
did
you
understand
counsel
to
say
that
he
thought
the
intended
the
federal
law
the
dischargeability
provisions
was
to
make
sure
that
the
fraud
which
barred
dischargeability
was
the
same
countrywide?
would
be
the
same
countrywide,
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
that
different?
that
understood
him
to
say
that
the
standard,
it
would
be
a
federal
standard
applicable
countrywide?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
suggest
that
colorado
law
fraud
is
the
same
as
the
law
of
fraud
in
every
state,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
agree
so
readily
that
it
has
to
be
that
--
that
bankruptcy
act
contemplates
a
national
standard
of
fraud
rather
than
picking
up
the
fraud
standard
from
the
state
in
which
the
bankruptcy
court
is
sitting
or
picking
up
the
fraud
standard
of
any
state
--
of
the
--
of
any
state
law
which
might
govern
the
country
--
or
the
transaction?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
--
mr.
justice
--
that's
the
case
that
mr.
justice
stevens
announce
this
morning
seem
to
think
that
the
state
law
wouldn't
govern
it
and
it
might
the
state
law
might
be
different
in
every
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
sure
you
could
buy
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
that
the
perhaps
the
bankruptcy
law
did
contemplate
in
national
standard
of
fraud
with
respect
to
dischargeability?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
says
the
other
defendants
that
only
two
other
defendants
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
keller.
may
we
come
back
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
reference
to
fraud
in
the
cross-claim?
would
you
take
a
look
at
page
38
of
appendix?
that
is
a
cross-claim,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
said
i
understood
it
that
there's
not
a
word
in
that
with
respect
to
the
misrepresentation.
what
--
what
about
the
first
summons
under
the
word
preliminary?
hereby
incorporates
by
reference
his
previous
answer
as
it
fully
set
forth
herein?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
the
previous
answers
on
page
34
as
i
understand
it
and
on
page
35
in
paragraph
3
under
affirmative
defenses
as
the
chief
justice
read
to
you.
it
seems
to
him
and
to
me
that
that
suggest
that
misrepresentation
was
charged
with
respect
with
all
of
the
defendants?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
--
maybe
so
that
the
he
had
to
go
to
the
court
but
the
question
is
what
are
the
ingredients
of
that
decision
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
seem
to
concede
yourself
that
if
the
whole
case
turn
on
the
fact
that
had
been
determining
against
the
creditor
in
the
state
proceeding.
there
wouldn't
be
much
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
--
if
it
had
been
determined
against
the
creditor.
if
the
fact,
if
there's
a
crucial
fact
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
determined
against
the
creditor
whose
claiming
nondischargeability.
there
wouldn't
be
much
of
the
proceeding
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
would
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
you
know
eventhough
--
eventhough
it
was
exercising
exclusive
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
counsel
it
is
just
suggesting
that
that's
the
case
here.
and
that
--
that
if
you
want
to
have
the
bankruptcy
court
exercise
--
that
you
can
get
to
bankruptcy
court
to
exercise
this
exclusive
jurisdiction
hereto,
it's
just
happens
to
be
bound
by
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
creditors
sues
in
the
state
court
for
fraud?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
let
me
suggest
to
you.
what
if
he
gets
a
judgment
for
fraud?
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
that
judgment.
alright.
so
and
--
and
can
he
file
on
as
a
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
if
he
said
--
and
what
if
there's
no
asset?
what
if
there's
no
assets
and
then
he
wants
the
determination
of
nondischargeability?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
bankruptcy
court
re-determine
the
legal
question
of
fraud?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
law
--
the
law
questions
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
it
works
both
ways?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
place?
i
mean
the
legal
--
the
issue
of
fraud
would
never
bind
the
bankruptcy
court
even
if
the
creditor
had
gotten
in
judgment
for
fraud
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
--
has
it
been
and
there
been
a
lot
of
cases
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
what's
the
--
is
there
some
general
view
about
whether
there's
a
national
standards
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
standard
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
a
national
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
--
that's
close
to
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
close
to
the
example
i
gave.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
-
what
about
you
said
four
of
the
five.
what
about
the
fifth?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
it
did
before
1970,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
--
only
the
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
think
--
you
would
say
the
state
decision
could
have
they
--
could
have
concluded
there
was
fraud
under
state
law
and
the
federal
court
could
decide.
there
wasn't
any
fraud
or
that
there
was
regardless
of
what
the
state
court
concluded
on
the
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
i
take
it
you
don't
--
you
think
there's
anything
specific
in
the
legislative
history
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
is
there
something
specific
that
reads
right
on
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
something
that
reads
right
on
it
out
of
the
legislative
history?
justice
byron
r.
white
page

then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
--
that
doesn't
get
you
very
far
along
the
line,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
it
doesn't
help
you
one
way
or
another
with
respect
to
collateral
estoppel?
