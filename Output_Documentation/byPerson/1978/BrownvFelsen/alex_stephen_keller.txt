mr.
alex
stephen
keller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
respondent,
we
suggest
that
the
tenth
circuit
decision
is
supported
both
by
good
law
and
by
common
sense.
the
counsel
suggests
that
the
determination
of
dischargeability
in
the
bankruptcy
court
is
exclusive.
i
don't
find
the
word
exclusive
in
the
statute
that
has
been
cited.
it's
simply
says
that
the
bankruptcy
court
shall
determine
dischargeability
and
we
don't
quarrel
with
that.
and
that
is
in
the
1970
amendment
to
the
act.
but
when
petitioner
says
that
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
proving
fraud
in
a
state
court
and
proving
fraud
in
the
bankruptcy
court
are
disagree
with
the
petition
the
definition
of
fraud
under
colorado
law
which
we've
cited
in
morrison
versus
goodspeed
element
four
on
intent
is
the
same
as
fraud
in
the
federal
system.
and
to
say
that
the
colorado
law
on
fraud
is
substantially
different
from
the
state
law
isn't
the
fact.
it's
the
distinction
without
any
real
difference.
if
the
state
court
in
colorado
when
i
suspect
most
states?
finds
a
misrepresentation
intentionally
made
and
so
on
and
finds
fraud
to
test
substantially
the
same
is
what
the
bankruptcy
act
says
is
nondischargeable.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
no,
sir.
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
in
our
case,
the
colorado
law
is
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
i
can't
really
argue
against
that.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
no.
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
no,
i
don't.
i
say
it
is
as
stringent
as
the
law
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
common
law
of
the
other
49
states
and
therefore
i
can't
tell
you
whether
all
of
the
elements
required
in
colorado
are
to
in
all
of
this
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
the
reason
i
say
that
and
i
could
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
well,
i
couldn't
--
of
course
it
would
be
entirely
in
error.
but
the
way
i
read
the
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
oh,
yes.
very
readily
mr.
justice
white
but
the
bankruptcy
act
does
in
fact
going
to
some
more
detail
about
what
is
fraud.
then
it
does
with
the
respect
to
who
gets
the
rent
on
is
between
the
trustee
and
so
on.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
i
think
it
contemplates
a
national
standard
in
the
light
of
good
common
sense.
i
don't
think
it
talks
about
nitpicking
slight
differences.
i
frankly
don't
know
the
law
of
fraud
of
every
state.
counsel
says
that
to
reach
a
contrary
result
to
petitioner's
position
that
is
to
sustain
the
tenth
circuit
means
that
the
courts
in
the
states
are
going
to
be
overly
crowded
with
creditors
unnecessarily
trying
to
plead
and
prove
fraud
when
they
shouldn't
have
to.
but
the
crowd
in
this
court's
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
right.
and
that
--
i
think
there's
one
petitioner's
argument.
but
the
state
courts
are
crowded
as
are
the
federal
courts.
and
in
the
case
of
a
creditor
who
has
a
bonafide
fraud
claim.
i
don't
mean
an
afterthought
like
this
one.
i
mean,
a
bonafide
fraud
claim
which
he
urges
throughout
and
pleads
it
which
anything
do
here.
that
kind
of
a
creditor
has
many
ways
to
protect
himself.
petitioner
suggests
that
i
said
in
my
brief
that
we
can
stipulate
the
non-dischargeability
ups
against
the
law.
that
isn't
what
i
said
in
my
brief.
what
i
said
in
the
brief
was
that
the
creditor
can
seek
a
stipulation
that
the
question
of
fraud
preserved
maybe
raised
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
he's
not
waiving
those
claims.
he
can
do
all
sorts
of
things
but
the
first
thing
he
has
to
do
is
plead
it
which
he
didn't
do
in
the
state
court.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
no,
sir.
there
was
an
affirmative
defense.
an
affirmative
defense
not
a
cross-claim.
in
which
mr.
brown
said,
that
there
were
misrepresentation
by
other
defendants
in
the
plural.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
no,
sir.
no
cross-claim
against
mr.
felsen
did
he
urge
fraud
and
counsel
for
petitioner
just
a
few
minutes
ago
conceded
that.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
it's
not
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
i
believe
it's
an
affirmative
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
what?
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
that's
correct.
and
i
--
i
see
on
page
35
an
affirmative
defense.
i
don't
see
an
allegation
of
fraud
in
any
cross-claim.
and
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
case
at
bar
in
its
opinion
found
that
there
was
a
casual
reference
to
fraud
in
the
answer.
and
it
does
not
meet
out
rules
of
civil
procedure.
it
does
not
meet
morrison
versus
goodspeed
and
was
disregarded
by
the
tenth
circuit.
that
wasn't
the
affirmative
defense.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
as
it
--
as
in
the
action
by
the
banks
against
the
guarantor
would
have
availed
him
nothing?
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
in
the
guarantor's
cross-claim
against
mark
felsen.
had
he
chosen
in
his
cross-claim
to
plead
fraud
which
he
didn't
do,
on
page
36
on
that
appendix
number
5,
had
he
chosen
to
do
that
then
the
bankrupt
--
if
when
it
came
time
to
try
stipulate
to
a
judgment
had
really
three
choices:
(a)
he
could
stipulate
that
he
was
guilty
of
fraud.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
unlikely.
(b)
he
could
stipulate
on
a
guarantee
that
he
was
liable
on
the
guarantee
which
what
he
did.
or
(c)
he
could
stipulate
for
judgment
against
himself
on
the
guarantee.
but
the
creditor
at
that
point
have
properly
pleaded
could
well
have
insisted
on
a
clause.
that
fraud
is
not
waived.
it
is
asserted
for
convenience.
it
is
not
inserted
in
the
stipulation
or
adjustment
but
none
of
the
creditor's
rights
on
fraud
are
waived.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
yes,
sir.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
not
a
hint.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
i
believe
the
judgment
controls
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
it
would
be
weaker
but
it
would
be
essentially
the
same.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
tenth
circuit
i
think
relied
on
the
difference
between
a
consent
judgment
and
a
judgment
by
default
on
the
one
hand.
and
i
believe
they
referred
the
u.s.
versus
armour
which
justice
marshall
and
i
quoted
it
in
my
brief
talked
at
length
about
a
consent
judgment
and
if
the
waiver
to
litigate
the
issue.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
the
issue
of
fraud.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
when
he
stipulates
in
a
judicial
sense
and
enters
into
a
consent
judgment
base
entirely
on
contract
and
indemnity,
entirely
on
that.
he
has
waived
his
right
to
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
situations.
i
think
this
is
a
classic
case
of
res
judicata.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
well
the
70
amendments,
do
they
really
change
the
substantive
law
or
do
they
simply
change
the
procedure.
now
riley
versus
nicolas,
justice
mcwilliams
of
the
tenth
circuit
said
that
the
70
amendments
clean
out
the
procedural
aspects
but
don't
really
change
the
substantive
law
of
bankruptcy.
that's
what
the
tenth
circuit
has
said
in
the
case
some
five,
six
years
ago.
in
the
sense
it
has
probably
too.
interestingly
enough
even
in
the
1970
amendments,
nothing
is
said
by
congress
as
to
what
happens
when
the
state
court
proceedings
are
finished
because
there
are
four
situations
in
which
one
can
find
himself.
situation
one
is
when
this
--
there
no
state
proceeding
has
ever
been
commenced.
there
of
course
the
creditor
has
a
clean
shot
to
litigate
the
fraud
questions.
the
second
situation
is
where
there
is
a
state
courts
case
pending
at
the
time
the
petition
and
bankruptcy
is
filed.
now,
the
statute
deals
with
that
in
section
(c)
(4),
the
congress
specifically
said
that
when
a
state
court
case
is
pending
and
the
complaint
is
filed
on
nondischargeability
for
fraud.
the
proceedings
are
state.
the
congress
specifically
spoke
to
that.
interestingly
enough,
when
it
comes
to
the
situation
such
as
we
have
were
the
state
court
proceedings
have
been
concluded
in
their
entirely.
here's
the
word,
in
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
congress
is
not
dealt
with
the
questions.
it
is
a
wide
open
issue.
but
what
happens
when
a
state
court
proceeding
has
been
concluded
that's
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
if
the
creditor
has
properly
pleaded
fraud,
we
have
one
set
of
circumstances.
if
he
never
raised
it
we
have
another.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
yes,
sir.
when
the
creditor
and
this
is
the
essence
i
think
of
the
tenth
circuit's
position.
when
the
creditor
has
never
hinted
fraud
in
his
cross-claim
or
in
his
compliant
and
it
has
said
nothing
about
it
and
permits
the
case
to
go
on
and
off.
and
finally
agrees
to
a
consent
judgment
which
under
armour
and
company
case
is
identical
to
a
litigated
case
has
he
then
waived
his
right
to
ever
litigate
fraud.
is
he
barred
by
res
judicata?
that's
the
question.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
there
are
many
reasons
to
raise
fraud
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
in
our
case,
it's
so
happens
that
--
but
let's
take
the
case
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
well,
they
take
bankruptcy
after
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
--
the
conclusion
of
the
state
court
and
that's
i've
said
that
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
there
are
at
least
under
colorado
law
some
additional
benefits
by
being
able
to
prove
fraud.
exemplary
and
punitive
damages
are
certainly
one
of
them.
but
the
execution
is
authorized
under
colorado
law
and
that's
another
as
admittedly
rarely
used
but
if
--
it
is
one
of
the
remedies
you
have
in
a
fraud
case.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
no.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
well,
that
was
the
previous
answer
and
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
yes,
and
thats
the
one
i'm
referring
to
and
that
is
included
in
the
affirmative
defense
which
uses
loose
language,
misrepresentation
and
non-disclosure
of
material
facts
which
is
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
preliminary
sense
on
page
38.
but
in
the
tenth
circuit
opinion
and
in
our
brief,
we
refer
to
the
colorado
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
the
case
of
morrison
versus
goodspeed
which
specifically
set
forth
how
you
plead
fraud.
and
the
allegation
--
this
is
in
our
judgment
nothing.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
well
i
would
say,
yes.
it's
mentioned
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
yes.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
but
to
say
that
paragraph
5
on
page
36
is
an
allegation
of
fraud.
i
don't
construed
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
yes,
i
don't
construed
that
way.
he
says
just
the
unfair
and
unconscionable
and
overreaching.
to
say
that
that's
a
pleading
of
fraud
is
going
a
long
way
is
the
tenth
circuit
applying
the
law
of
colorado
and
its
own
rejected
that
argument.
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
under
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
it's
rule
9
(b)
of
the
colorado
rules
of
civil
procedures
--
mr.
alex
stephen
keller
yes,
sir.
some
page
5
of
our
brief
about
the
two-thirds
the
way
down.
it
says,
“shall
be
stated
with
particularity.”
and
then
we
have
the
case
of
morrison
versus
goodspeed
which
is
a
colorado
case
which
sets
out
what
you
have
to
plead.
in
the
tenth
circuit,
i
believe
judge
barrett
wrote
the
opinion
applied
those
rules
in
reaching
its
decision.
so
we
say
that
in
our
case
and
the
case
at
bar,
the
question
of
fraud
is
an
afterthought,
coming
after
the
completion
of
all
prior
proceedings,
the
state
courts
had
already
acted.
the
creditor
did
not
perfect
his
rights
and
all
state
court
proceedings
and
civilly
wants
--
the
creditor
wants
a
second
bite
in
an
apple
which
never
existed
because
there
was
no
fraud
properly
urge
in
the
state
proceeding.
