if
there
had
been
would
your
case
be
significantly
different?
assuming
the
judgment
made
no
reference
to
fraud.
which
--
which
controls
a
complaint
or
the
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
there
--
if
there
had
been
an
allegation
of
fraud
and
no
mention
of
it
in
the
consent
judgment,
your
argument
would
be
the
same,
i
take
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
should
there
be
a
waiver?
that's
really
no
purpose
in
alleging
fraud
in
that
case
and
how
is
the
debtor
been
prejudiced
by
his
failure
to
do
so.
i
just
don't
understand
why
he
should
take
the
travel
to
inject
into
this
necessary
issue
into
that
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mentioned
punitive
damages.
for
example,
i
take
you
start
with
the
proposition
that
this
person
is
pretty
nearly
insolvent
anyway.
yes,
but
judgment
proof
debtor
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that's
almost
by
hypothesis.
we're
dealing
people
with
people
who
go
though
bankruptcy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
they
were
totally
solvent
and
could
pay
the
debt
hundred
cents
on
a
dollar,
why
even
then?
why
litigate
fraud
if
he
can
sign
a
note
and
say
i
owe
the
money?
why
would
you
take
to
travel
to
raise
fraud
if
you
could
get
money
more
quickly
by
settling
this
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
very
helpful
when
one
of
your
debtors
is
corporation
though?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
sir.
