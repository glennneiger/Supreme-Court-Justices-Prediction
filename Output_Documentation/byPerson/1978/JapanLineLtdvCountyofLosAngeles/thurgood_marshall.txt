not
the
way
you
approached

you
had
these

to
a
warehouse?
justice
thurgood
marshall
[voice
overlap]
between
a
container
sitting

and
a
warehouse,
if
you
don't
move
the
container?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
agree
they
are
different
but
there
wouldn't
be
any
difference
in
my
case,
would
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
a
warehouse
that
holds
a
1000
tires
and
a
container
that
holds
a
1000
tires
and
they
both
sit
there
for
a
year,
the
difference
is
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and

can
tax
it?
justice
