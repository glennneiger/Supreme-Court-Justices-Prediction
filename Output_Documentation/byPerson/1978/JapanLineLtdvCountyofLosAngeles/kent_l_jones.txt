mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
concern
has
been
expressed
so
far
on
the
question
whether
this
court
has
ever
applied
the
home
port
doctrine
in
the
international
context.
of
course
every
time
the
court
has
distinguished
hays
it
is
done
so
with
express
recognition
that
the
rule
may
be
different
for
international
transport
and
in
the
first
case
that
distinguished
hays,
the
pullman
palace
car
company
case,
the
court
expressly
stated
that
the
rule
with
regard
to
instruments
for
intercommunication
with
other
nations
may
require
national
treatment.
but
at
least
since
this
court's
decision
in
hays
and
until
the
imposition
of
the
tax
by
appellees
in
this
case,
the
consistent
domestic
practice
of
the
united
states
has
been
to
exempt
foreign-owned
and
domiciled
instruments
of
foreign
commerce
from
local
property
taxation.
our
domestic
practice
in
this
regard
is
confirmed
to
the
international
custom
that
affords
an
immunity
from
local
property
taxation
to
other
nations'
instruments
of
world
commerce.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
if
all
--
as
i
understand
your
question,
at
least
part
of
that
commerce
was
domestic
commerce?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well
in
that
context
the
international
custom
wouldn't
apply
because
the
international
rule
would
not
purport
to
intervene
with
the
regulation
of
the
domestic
commerce
between
points
within
in
the
nation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
that
journey
were
in
domestic
commerce
as
opposed
to
simply
carrying
imported
goods
further
along
and
bringing
exported
goods
out
that
would
not
be
in
consistent
with
our
understanding
of
the
international
practice.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
article
11
deals
with
the
question
of
–
no,
i
think
that
article
11
is
exactly
consistent
with
what
i
have
said.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
but
our
position
with
regard
to
the
customs
convention
on
containers
is
that
by
its
terms,
it
only
restricts
the
imposition
of
duties.
i
intend
to
discuss
at
the
close
of
my
argument
why
we
think
it
also
has
relevance.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes
it
is.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
don't
see,
i'm
having
trouble
seeing
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
i
wouldn't
argue
with
that.
then
immunity
conferred
by
the
international
custom
is
not
simply
a
commercial
favor
granted
by
nations
to
foreign
co-operations.
instead
it
is
based
on
a
recognition
of
the
special
interest
that
each
nation
posses
in
the
development
and
utilization
of
its
instruments
for
world
trade.
and
is
in
this
sense
an
expression
of
difference
and
mutual
accommodation
among
commercial
nations.
the
tax
imposed
by
appellees
in
this
case
in
the
similar
tax
on
foreign
aircraft
that
the
state
has
proposed
to
asses
is
a
direct
departure
from
the
excepted
international
practice.
appellees
claim
that
because
the
tax
is
an
apportion
tax
it
does
not
unconstitutionally
burden
commerce.
but
this
argument
we
submit
is
made
with
an
parochial
and
unrealistic
framework.
it
is
true
that
is
recently
as
the
washington
stevedoring
case,
this
court
has
stated
that
when
a
tax
on
commerce
within
the
united
states
is
apportioned
among
the
states,
multiple
burdens
on
such
commerce
“logically
cannot
occur.”
but
the
logic
of
that
conclusion
depends
on
the
fact
that
in
cases
involving
domestic
or
interstate
commerce
such
as
the
standard
oil
and
the
braniff
cases,
this
court
can
require
the
state
of
domicile
as
well
as
the
non-domiciliary
state
to
apportion
the
tax
with
the
result
that
the
property
in
aggregate
is
subject
to
only
one
tax
on
its
full
value.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
we
rely
exclusively
on
the
commerce
clause
that
we
think
the
import-export
clause
argument
could
be
investigated,
but
it
is
wholly
subsidiary
to
the
commerce
clause
argument.
if
we
loose
on
the
commerce
clause
argument
we
would
definitely
loose
on
the
import-export
clause
argument.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is
an
independent
argument
which,
i
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no
i
would
say
it's
a
supremacy
clause
argument.
the
logic
of
the
domestic
cases
however
has
not
and
cannot
realistically
be
applied
to
foreign
domiciled
instruments
of
foreign
commerce.
the
international
custom
that
exempts
these
instruments
from
local
property
taxation
also
recognizes
as
this
court
recognized
in
hays
that
the
nation
of
domicile
may
impose
a
full
tax
on
the
value
of
its
instruments
of
foreign
trade.
the
practical,
logical
consequence
of
appellees'
unilateral
imposition
of
its
tax
in
conflict
with
the
international
practice
is
to
inflict
a
multiple
tax
burden
on
foreign
domiciled
instruments
of
commerce
and
specially
disadvantage
this
commerce
because
of
its
origin.
the
burden
cannot
simply
be
removed
by
international
agreement
as
the
state
court
suggested.
even
assuming
that
a
rule
of
apportion
taxation
is
desirable
in
the
international
context,
such
a
rule
cannot
be
dictated
to
the
world
by
the
united
states,
much
less
by
a
single
state.
the
state
department
has
noted
that
there
is
no
realistic
likelihood
that
other
nations
will
be
willing
to
alter
the
international
practice
merely
to
confirm
to
the
states'
contrary
rule.
retaliation
rather
than
accommodation
appears
the
more
likely
response
to
any
unilateral
domestic
action.
unless
foreign
commerce
is
to
suffer,
the
tax
treatment
of
foreign
domiciled
instruments
of
foreign
commerce,
necessarily
requires
a
uniform
national
rule
that
is
based
either
on
the
accepted
international
practice
or
results
from
reciprocal
negotiations,
rather
than
unilateral
fiat.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
i
would.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no
i
would
say
that
the
court's
conclusion
in
that
case
was
that
there
was
no
need
for
a
uniform
national
rule
or
in
any
event
that
the
states
rule
didn't
conflict
with
any
such
need.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
uniform
rule
that
we
think
is
needed
in
this
case
would
have
to
come
either
from
the
accepted
international
practice
or
a
revision
of
that
practice
that
could
only
be
obtained
by
reciprocal
negotiations.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would
say
that
that's
correct.
the
states
interjection
of
its
single
voice
on
a
matter
that's
previously
been
characterized
by
and
we
think
requires
international
accommodation
as
occasion
substantial
expressions
have
concerned
by
our
major
trading
partners.
the
principle
of
mutual
accommodation
that
underlies
the
home
port
rule
and
the
desire
to
avoid
multiple
burdens
on
foreign
trade
has
consistently
been
reflected
in
our
foreign
policy
as
in
our
adoption
of
international
conventions
to
provide
temporary
free
admission
to
this
country
or
foreign
containers
and
aircraft
employed
in
foreign
commerce.
the
state's
independent
action
threatens
the
national
interest
in
conducting
foreign
commercial
relations
on
a
basis
of
international
mutuality
and
reciprocity.
we
submit
that
the
action
of
a
single
state
cannot,
consistent
with
the
commerce
clause,
be
allowed
to
define
the
appropriate
foreign
commercial
policy
for
the
entire
union.
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
we
think
there
is
an
additional
reason
that
appellees
tax
is
invalid
based
on
the
rationale
of
the
mcgoldrick
case.
in
mcgoldrick,
this
court
had
before
the
provisions
of
the
customs
laws
that
permit
imported
articles
to
be
admitted
free
of
duty
for
manufacture
and
re-exportation.
the
court
held
that
the
objectives
of
this
federal
immunity
was
to
provide
a
competitive
advantage
to
the
trade
and
that
would
be
injured
if
the
state
were
allowed
to
impose
its
general
sales
tax
on
the
merchandise,
thereby
lessening
the
competitive
advantage
that
congress
had
created.
the
court
concluded
that
the
state
tax
was
invalid
because
in
this
practical
operation,
it
tended
to
frustrate
the
federal
objective.
in
our
brief,
we
note
that
the
customs
convention
on
containers
provide
similar
treatment
to
foreign
owned
containers
in
that
the
containers
are
to
be
admitted
free
of
duty
for
exclusive
using
foreign
commerce.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
my
understanding
of
the
record
is
that
the
effect
of
the
container,
the
possibility
that
the
state
tax
was
inconsistent
with
the
container
convention
was
raised
now
the
way
in
which
the
argument
was
framed
below
was
different
than
the
way
it
is
framed
here.
below
it
was
framed
simply
as
a
question
as
i
understand
it
of
whether
the
state
had
--
whether
the
state
tax
was
a
prohibited
duty.
here
it
is
raised
on
a
different
basis,
but
it's
our
understanding
that
the
container
convention
was
discussed
by
the
court
below.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
true.
in
this
sense,
the
cause
of
action
was
stated.
it
was
certainly
claimed
that
the
container
convention
as
a
treaty,
but
there
was
[voice
overlap]
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes
it
was
raised
also.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
with
the
last
caveat
that
you
added
i
would
say
that
yes
he
could
raise
it,
if
he
talked
about
it
in
the
state
supreme
court?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would
have
to
defer
to
counsel
on
that,
i
can't
say
for
certain.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
my
understanding
was
that
it
was
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
as
i
recall
the
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court,
which
of
course
incorporated
the
decision
of
the
appellate
court,
the
container
convention
argument
had
been
rejected
in
the
case
that
court
had
previously
considered
the
sea-land
case
and
it's
my
recollection
which
may
be
incorrect
and
i
cannot
find
the
source
at
this
point
that
there
was
reference
made
in
the
opinion
in
this
court
to
the
fact
that
the
customs
convention
had
been
held
to
be
inapplicable
in
its
prior
decision.
the
issue
has
been
presented
to
the
state
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
want
you
to
look
it
up.
i
wish
i
knew
where
it
were,
but
i
regret
that
i
do
not.
i
can
if
time
permits
i
will
attempt
to.
the
objective
of
the
container
convention
is
to
facilitate
the
use
of
the
containers
in
world
trade
by
avoiding
the
imposition
of
multiple
burdens
on
the
containers
as
they
move
from
nation
to
nation.
the
tax
imposed
in
this
case
could
under
appellees'
theory
be
assessed
also
by
other
states
and
other
nations
and
thus
create
a
multiple
barrier
to
the
use
of
containers
in
the
--
as
instruments
in
world
trade,
a
barrier
that
would
frustrate
the
objective
of
the
container
convention.
i
should
note
in
one
limited
regard
the
regulations
implementing
the
container
convention
go
beyond
the
convention
substantive
requirement
that
containers
be
exempted
from
duties
only
while
they
are
engaged
exclusively
in
foreign
commerce.
sub-section
f
of
the
regulations
allows
a
narrow
exception
for
domestic
use
of
foreign
containers,
if
the
domestic
traffic
is
only
incidental
to
the
foreign
commerce
and
is
along
the
containers
route
in
international
trade.
if
any
foreign
containers
travel
under
that
exception,
state
taxation
of
the
incidental
domestic
use
would
not
conflict
with
the
objective
of
the
[inaudible]
convention,
which
affords
an
immunity
only
when
the
container
moves
exclusively
in
foreign
commerce.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
don't
think
that
the
regulations
themselves
here
in
this
case
control
our
analysis
under
the
mcgoldrick
theory
any
more
than
the
regulations
we
thought
relevant
by
the
court
in
mcgoldrick.
we
think
that
the
substantive
scheme
is
established
by
the
treaty
as
it
was
established
by
the
statute
in
mcgoldrick.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
regulatory
authority
--
there
is
regulatory
authority
to
amplify
the
substantive
scheme
and
we
wouldn't
contend
that
the
incidental
domestic
use
exception
was
inconsistent
with
the
container
convention,
but
we
would
say
that
it
is
not
supported
by
the
container
convention
and
that
it
is
only
the
objectives
of
the
container
convention
to
protect
the
use
the
use
of
instruments
in
exclusively
as
they
are
used
exclusively
in
foreign
commerce.
the
state
taxation
of
the
incidental
domestic
use
would
not
conflict
with
the
container
convention.
it
is
only
where
the
tax
is
applied
as
in
this
case
to
containers
that
are
involved
exclusively
in
foreign
commerce
that
the
tax
is
in
conflict
with
the
international
practice
and
also
tends
to
frustrate
the
objectives
of
the
container
convention.
