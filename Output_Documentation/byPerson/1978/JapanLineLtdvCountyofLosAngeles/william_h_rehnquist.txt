justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
arguing
both
the
home
port
doctrine
and
the
customs
convention,
mr.
briger?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
perhaps
that
you
intended
to
blend
them
together
in
that
last
sentence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
home
port
doctrine
is
constitutionally
based,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
case
would
not
be
as
strong,
apart
from
the
home
port
doctrine,
without
the
affirmative
adoption
of
the
customs
convention,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches
that
speak
for
this
country
on
foreign
policy,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
hays
mail
didn't
--
the
pacific
mail
case
didn't
depend
on
any
action
of
the
executive
branch,
did
it
or
did
it
of
the
legislative
branch?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
it
wouldn't
involve
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states.
now
supposing
that
in
the
interest
of
the
administration's
human
rights
policy,
it
were
determined
by
the
executive
here
in
washington
that
a
particular
state
government
should
release
particular
prisoners.
would
you
say
that,
that
is
something
that
the
executive
would
have
power
to
order
the
state
to
do,
over
and
apart
from
any
other
substantive
grant
of
authority
simply
because
it
furthered
the
foreign
relations
of
the
country?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
the
authority
of
a
state
to
impose
the
tax
depends
on
head
count
of
what
other
countries
think
about
it,
is
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
are
familiar
with
our
michelin
tire
case,
are
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
state
department
had
taken
a
census
of
foreign
nations
in
that
case
and
they
have
come
out
the
same
way
that
they
objected
to
this
form
of
taxation.
do
you
think
michelin
should
have
come
out
differently
in
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
agree
that
the
home
port
doctrine
has
heretofore
never
been
applied
by
this
court
to
anything
except
domestic
commerce,
that
has
been
applied
to
international
commerce?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
well
then
–
and
do
other
countries
have
a
similar
home
port
doctrine
to
ours?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
our
negotiators
be
so
confident
that
the
home
port
doctrine
would
govern
property
taxes
when
this
court
had
never
applied
it
to
international
trade?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
it
seemed
to
be
the
practice,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
congress
couldn't
by
legislation
impose
such
a
tax
as
this
or
authorize
the
states
to
impose
such
tax,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
a
minute
ago
you
said
that
not
even
the
federal
government
could
authorize
the
imposition
of
this
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
what
if
this
container
had
been
used
not
only
to
ship
material
from
japan
to
long
beach,
but
in
inland
from
long
beach
say
to
sacramento,
but
then
a
separate
trip
had
been
made
in
the
container
shipping
goods
from
sacramento
down
to
the
imperial
valley
and
then
it
had
gone
back
to
long
beach?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
container
could,
a
prorate
tax
could
be
levied
on
the
container
based
on
the
portion
of
the
time
that
it
spent
making
the
journey
from
sacramento
to
another
point
in
california
carrying
cargo?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
say
that
was
consistent
with
the
bob-lo
case
which
you
just
said?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
had
been
either
reciprocal
negotiations
or
uniform
practice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
quite
what
you
said
in
the
sentence
before
that,
is
it,
that
it
has
to
depend
either
on
uniform
international
practice
or
negotiations
reciprocal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
in
some
cases,
international
commerce
does
not
“need”
a
uniform
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
this
wasn't
raised
before
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
does
the
secretary's
authority
come
from
the
issue
of
regulations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
rely
only
on
the
treaty
and
not
on
the
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
the
state
of
california
perfectly
free
of
the
judgment
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
reversed
here
to
say
the
hell
with
these
containers,
we
are
not
going
to
provide
any
protection
to
them
because
they
don't
contribute
--
we
are
not
allowed
to
exact
an
aliquot
share
of
their
tax
burden?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
clark,
supposing
that
we
were
--
the
president
were
to
negotiate
a
treaty
with
japan
confirmed
by
the
--
ratified
by
the
senate
and
congress
has
implementing
legislation
under
the
interstate
commerce
power
saying
exactly
what
the
treaty
said
that
no
property
imported
from
japan
should
ever
be
subjected
to
any
state
property
tax
so
long
as
it
was
in
existence,
no
matter
how
long
it
had
been
in
this
country,
do
you
think
it
will
be
constitutional
for
congress
to
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
proper
did
you
think
that
would
be
constitutional
for
congress
to
do
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
fact
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
possible
to
distinguish
the
aircraft
from
the
taxation
and
the
containers
here
so
that
we
could
affirm
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
yet
nonetheless
not
foreclose
the
question
of
the
taxability
of
the
aircraft?
