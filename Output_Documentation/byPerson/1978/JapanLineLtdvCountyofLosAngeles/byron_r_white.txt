justice
byron
r.
white
hays
wasn't
an
international
case,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
is
between
two
ports
of
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
and
the
problem
was
amongst
states
of
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wasn't
one
that
dealt
with
an
international
trade?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
just
give
me
another
one
under
hays
or
any
other
one
that
dealt
with
an
international?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
thought.
so
that
to
the
extent
that
hays,
there
was
a
constitutional
rule,
it
was
an
interstate
commerce,
it's
a
commerce
clause
rule
and
congress
could
change
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
hays
was
not
the
same
today
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
traffic
between
two
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
that
something
like
the
hays
rule
of
the
court
and
everyone
thought
appropriate
for
a
long
time
is
still
appropriate
for
international
trade?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
there
will
be
a
violation
with
the
commerce
clause,
would
you
if
the
international
practice
had
been
just
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
would
have
been
sensible
if
convention
addressed
itself
to
containers
and
to
taxes?
i
wonder
it
would
have
been
quiet
sensible
to
deal
with
property
taxes,
like
that,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
to
reflect
this
international
custom?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
any
regulatory
power
pursuant
to
the
convention
on
containers
or
pursuant
to
any
other
statute
to
affect
this
tax?
he
has
issued
the
regulations
to
implement
the
united
states
duties
under
the
container
convention?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
he
could
reach
this
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that
if
you
think
the
--
if
the
basis
for
ruling
in
your
favor
is
the
danger
of
double
taxation,
is
that
it
â€“
is
that
really
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
should
california
do
about
containers
from
afghanistan
if
they
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
you
are
talking
about
all
containers,
not
just
containers
from
afghanistan.
what
about
--
how
about
this
property
tax
was
on
containers
from
afghanistan?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
customs
convention
argument
isn't
an
independent
one
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
necessarily
common?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
another
treaty
was
presented
i
take
it,
and
the
treaty
clause
or
the
supremacy
clause
was
--
that
kind
of
an
argument
was
presented?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
it
a
treaty
of
friendship
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
relied
up
on
too,
which
was
another
supremacy
clause
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
it
would
be
sufficient
in
a
state
court
for
a
party
to
rely
on
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
come
up
here
and
say
i
abandoned
my
equal
protection
clause
argument,
i
am
now
relying
on
the
due
process
clause
and
say
i
talked
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
state
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
regulatory
authority
rises
under
a
separate
statute?
