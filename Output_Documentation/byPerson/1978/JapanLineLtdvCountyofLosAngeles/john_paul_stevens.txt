before
you
do
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
the
points
you
just
made
about
the
home
port
doctrine,
would
it
apply
--
would
there
be
any
difference
if
in
this
case
involved
the
taxation
on
the
vessel
itself
rather
than
the
containers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
vessels
where
there
are
you
know
10
or
15
days
at
a
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
they
are
precisely
as
the
same
as
your
same
amount
of
time
in
the
port
and
exactly
the
same
protection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
want
to
be
sure
what
you
are
suggesting
here
about
the
quid
pro
quo.
this
is
your
idea,
there
are
no
cases
that
suggest
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
why
you
make
the
argument
so
strenuously.
it
seems
me
you
would
be
much
tactically
much
better
off
to
say
yes
congress
has
all
the
power
in
the
world,
but
hasn't
exercised
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
might
happen
is
that
you
won't
be
able
to
tax
things,
if
you
haven't
been
able
to
tax
unless
couple
of
hundred
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
the
vessels
have
been
coming
and
going
and
i
think
you
stared
earlier
and
saying
these
are
just
like
vessels
and
i
don't
think
you
try
to
tax
vessels
for
couple
of
hundred
years?
