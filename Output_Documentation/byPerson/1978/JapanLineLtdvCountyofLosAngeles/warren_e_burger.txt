we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
and
first
this
year,
in
japan
line
limited
against
county
of
los
angeles.
mr.
briger,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
what
is
that
they
do
if
they
are
relying?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
there
be
the
same
reciprocity
factor
that
we
have
in
international
trade
and
in
the
hypothetical
presented
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
briger,
your
reference
to
this
canvas
of
the
100
other
embassies,
i
take
it
is
not
to
suggest
that
we
take
a
poll
of
what
they
think
about
it,
but
the
implications
of
their
answer
and
that
those
implications
are
that
if
you
tax
the
components
of
our
vessels,
we
are
going
to
tax
the
components
of
your
vessels,
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
none
of
the
tonnage
clause
is
a
straw
in
the
wind
that
--

mr.
jones?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
clark?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
was
in
fact
an
average
person
per
ship
obviously,
wasn't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
more
of
them
truck
itself
that
bears
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
carrier,
the
container
here
does
not
wear
the
highway
out
any
more
than
the
truck
would
if
they
had
taken
everything
out
of
the
container
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
show
what
the
added
weight
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
your
answer
you
are
talking
about
now?
you
mean
federal
government
can't
come
in
and
furnish
police
escort,
and
the
fire
departments
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
that
someone
in
new
jersey
starts
a
steamboat
line
running
up
or
a
diesel
would
be
today
i
suppose,
a
diesel
running
up
the
hudson
river
and
then
it
obviously
make
stops
at
hudson
river
ports,
can
new
york
tax
the
diesel
barges
and
vessels
that
are
going
from
new
jersey
up
the
hudson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
say
they
have
exactly
what
we
have
got
here
can
â€“
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now
gibbons
against
ogden
didn't
involve
the
tax.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
involved
the
licensing,
but
you
suggest
that
new
york
could
tax
new
jersey's
diesel
barges
going
up
to
hudson,
pullman's
palace
cars.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
urging
that
as
an
economic
argument,
advancing
it
that
way
or
as
a
constitutional
argument
that
there
is
a
constitutional
obligation
to
provide
a
substitute
for
the
tax
revenue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
said
they
could
it
if
they
made
the
substitute
provision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
