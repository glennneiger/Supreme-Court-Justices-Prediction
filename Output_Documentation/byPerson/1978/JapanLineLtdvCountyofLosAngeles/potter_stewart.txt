but
it's
not
another
answer,
it's
a
different
ground
for
the
same
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
that
will
be
the
same
if
the
average
were
three
days,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
on
average,
three
days
per
annum.
justice

and
that
was
the
case,
wasn't
it
in
the
hays
case
the
â€“
that
was
a
new
york
corporation
with
new
york
shareholders
and
but
their
ships
rightly
went
to
san
francisco
and
said
the
opinion
states
i
don't
have
in
front
of
me
that
the
ships
were
in
san
francisco
regularly
and
spent
enough
time
in
san
francisco
to
unload
and
get
new
stores
aboard
and
so
on,
and
presumably
they
were
there
for
an
average
length
of
time
each
ship
for
each
year.
justice

what
article
1
power
would
that
be,
the
power
over
international
commerce?
justice
potter
stewart
the
president
of
united
states
negotiates
treaties
and
then
only
one
house
of
congress
gets
involved
in
those,
that's
the
senate,
but
i
am
telling
you
my
brother
brennan's
question
to
you
had
to
do
with
what
congress
could
do,
not
what
the
president
and,
if
there
is
a
senate
--
justice
potter
stewart
therefore,
they
couldn't,
congress
under
that
explicitly
conferred
power
totally
exempt
these
things
from
taxation,
local,
state
or
national
and
why
wouldn't
that
be
preemptive
of
any
county
or
state?
justice
potter
stewart
we
must
talk
and
see
that
of
course
we
have
a
federal
system,
but
we
must
talk
and
see
it
further
than
the
framers
chose
to
confer
a
great
deal
of
power
upon
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
the
area
of
interstate
and
international
commerce,
that's
correct
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
congress
would
--
if
these
things
or
these
instrumentalities
as
they
have
been
called
are
in
the
international
commerce
then
why
wouldn't
congress
have
complete
power
to
exempt
them
from
taxation?
justice
potter
stewart
then
i
--
did
i
misunderstand
your
answer
to
my
brother
brennan's
question?
i
thought
you
said
yes
congress
could
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
wasn't
your
idea
to
make
this
broad
argument,
you
are
simply
trying
to
answer
the
questions
from
members
of
the
court.
