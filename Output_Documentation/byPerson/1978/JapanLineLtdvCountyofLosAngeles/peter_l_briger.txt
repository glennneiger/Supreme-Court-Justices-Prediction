mr.
peter
l.
briger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
precise
issue
to
be
decided
in
this
case
is
whether
the
existence
of
situs
through
the
fiction
of
an
assumed
average
presence,
can
be
relied
upon
by
appellees
so
as
to
tax
foreign
containers
which
are
used
exclusively
in
foreign
commerce,
are
continuously
in
transit,
and
which
the
trial
court
found
had
their
home
port
in
japan,
so
as
to
justify
a
conclusion
of
continuous
presence
within
appellee's
jurisdiction.
such
presence
is
necessary
in
order
to
permit
the
subjection
of
containers
to
an
apportioned
ad
valorem
california
property
tax.
such
tax,
it
is
noted,
would
be
in
addition
to
full
ad
valorem
property
taxes,
which
have
been
levied
upon
the
containers
at
their
home
port
in
japan.
unless
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
is
reversed,
this
case
undoubtedly
will
have
profound
and
adverse
impacts
upon
the
foreign
trade
relations
of
the
united
states.
indeed
the
court
in
requesting
the
solicitor
general
to
express
his
views
on
the
case
has
recognized
the
important
foreign
policy
and
foreign
relations
questions
triggered
by
californiaâ€™s
unilateral
rejection
of
the
home
port
doctrine
in
the
case
of
foreign
owned
instrumentalities
used
exclusively
in
foreign
commerce.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
yes
i'm.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
i
do
indeed.
i
believe
that
the
customs
convention
is
another
indication
of
the
federal
interest
in
this
area
and
that
the
home
port
doctrine
was
a
means
enunciated
by
this
court
more
than
a
130
years
ago
in
order
to
deal
with
the
treatment
of
the
taxation
of
foreign-owned
instrumentalities
that
the
customs
convention
is
one
of
numerous
areas
of
federal
expression
of
its
concern
in
this
area.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
yes
it
is.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
i
think
it
probably
would
be.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
there
are
long
established
customs
among
the
trading
nations
of
the
world
which
have
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
its
adoption
of
the
hays
versus
pacific
mail
shipping
company
case,
this
was
a
basic
commerce
clause
rule
and
that
there
are
reliance
interests
of
foreign
governments
on
this
long
accepted
policy.
they
have
based
their
trade
relations
with
the
united
states
in
connection
with
the
international
carriage
of
goods
and
passengers.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
well,
every
country
your
honor
and
this
comes
out
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
every
country
with
the
exception
possibly
of
afghanistan,
in
the
treatment
of
the
international
carriage
of
goods
and
persons
by
aircraft,
vessels
or
containers
has
followed
a
policy
of
reciprocal
exemption
from
local
or
national
taxes
upon
these
instrumentalities
and
all
governments
of
the
world
in
their
trading
relations
have
observed
this
policy.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
indeed.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
it
did
not
but
there
are
really
two
policies
that
coalesce.
the
court
in
the
hays
decision
at
that
time
came
to
this
conclusion
in
order
to
eliminate
the
cumulative
burdens
of
multiple
taxation.
there
is
a
clear
statement
in
that
case.
now
of
course
the
case
was
decided
before
the
apportionment
rule
became
the
law
for
the
states.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
it
dealt
with
ocean
carriage
and
it
dealt.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
indeed.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
well,
justice
white,
while
the
case
did
deal
with
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
but
we
are
dealing
with
international
trade
in
this
case
i
would
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
the
court
has
never
dealt
with.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
those
were
the
specific
facts
of
the
hays
case.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
no
i
don't
believe
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
there
were
arguments
that
various
treaties
invalidated
the
imposition
of
the
tax,
specifically
the
treaty
of
friendship,
commerce
and
navigation,
the
general
agreement
on
tariffs
and
trade,
so
that
the
argument
was
made
that
in
general
there
were
treaty
obligations
of
the
united
states
which
indicated
its
interest
in
this
area
of
the
international
carriage
of
goods
in
connection
with
foreign-owned
instrumentalities,
but
we
would
argue
that
the
commerce
clause
by
itself
gives
the
federal
government
without
the
necessity
of
any
specific
legislation
or
treaty,
the
exclusive
interest
because
this
is
an
area
that
impacts
upon
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
and
there
have
been
governments
which
for
more
than
almost
two
hundred
years
have
relied
upon
this
exemption
from
taxation.
in
fact,
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
the
california
constitutional
provision,
exempting
domestic-owned
vessels
from
taxation
was
inserted
into
the
california
law
in
recognition
that
under
the
home
port
doctrine,
foreign-owned
vessels
were
quoted
that
privilege.
it
is
an
area
where
there
has
been
substantial
reliance
by
foreign
governments
who
find
this
rule
and
that
fact
is
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
i
believe.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
not
at
all
justice
white
and
that
is
because
the
apportionment
rule
is
the
law
for
all
of
the
states.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
yes
your
honor
where
the
apportionment
rule
cannot
be
enforced
upon
foreign
governments
either
by
state,
local
governments
or
by
the
federal
government.
and
it
is
really
the
major
thrust
of
our
argument
and
the
linchpin
of
our
argument
would
be
standard
oil
versus
peck
where
this
court
confirmed
that
the
apportionment
rule
was
the
only
means
by
which
state
and
local
governments
could
impose
taxes
in
connection
with
interstate
commerce.
and
once
that
rule
became
the
law
of
the
land
it
was
possible
for
this
court
to
eliminate
the
burdens
of
multiple
taxation
which
the
court
since
the
time
of
justice
stone
has
indicated
would
clearly
be
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
but
absent,
absent
the
binding
oblique
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
no
your
honor,
not
at
all
and
we
would
argue
that
if
there
had
been
an
international
practice
whether
by
practice
custom,
treaty,
multilateral
agreement
that
would
not
then
involve
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states,
but
the
point
is
that
for
200
years
this
country
has
followed
the
practice
of
not
imposing
local
property
taxes
upon
foreign-owned
containers.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
it
would
depend
on
how
significantly
justice
rehnquist
it
interfered
with
the
foreign
relations
of
the
country.
if
it
were
incidental
and
the
states
had
a
co-extensive
jurisdiction,
it
would
be
a
vain
process.
here
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
well,
this
was
the
point
i
was
just
going
to
make,
your
honor,
that
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
clear
situation
where
in
the
letter
of
the
state
department
where
they
canvassed,
more
than
a
hundred
embassies
there
seems
to
be
a
clearly
established
policy.
i
think
we
would
have
a
very
difficult
time
if
roughly
50
percent
of
the
nations
were
to
impose
these
taxes
and
50
percent
did
not.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
but
it
may.
what
i'm
saying
here
is
that
they
are
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
i
could,
justice
marshall
that
could
be
if
the
governments
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
yes
your
honor,
i
could
see
that
if
the
governments
decided
that
apportionment
made
more
sense
and
was
more
rational
and
they
adopted
rules
through
some
type
of
multilateral
treaty.
if
for
instance
in
connection
with
the
current
trade
negotiations
it
were
determined
by
a
group
of
nations
that
it
is
a
more
sensible
approach
to
follow
apportionment
i
could
see
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
it
might
will
be
a
good
idea
and
it's
or
--
but
since
there
has
been
this
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
i
think
that
the
states
could
urge
the
federal
government
indeed
to
enter
into
new
treaties
with
foreign
governments
and
this
could
be
done
as
a
matter
of
the
treaty
power
of
the
federal
government
and
in
that
sense
it
might
be
a
rational
way
to
approach
the
problem.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
no
your
honor
that
that
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
we
brought
it
here
because
there
has
been
this
clear
custom
and
where
there
has
been
a
custom
and
a
reliance
interest
by
foreign
governments
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
states
even
in
their
power
to
tax
cannot
change
a
fundamental
principle
which
has
been
recognized
by
the
international
community
of
nations
for
more
than
200
years,
probably
longer.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
yes
i'm
indeed.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
well,
no
i
think
michelin
is
correct
and
i
think
that
michelin
and
the
court
was
very
careful
to
indicating
michelin
by
the
way
that
they
would
not
tax
under
the
import-export
clause
or
under
the
commerce
clause
property
that
was
merely
in
transit
and
i
believe
the
court
left
that
exception
there
because
they
were
concerned
with
the
burdens
of
multiple
taxation
in
an
area
where
apportionment
was
not
recognized
by
our
trading
partners.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
indeed
that's
the
sum
and
substance
of
it
and
also
it's
the
perception
of
that
department
of
the
united
states
government
which
is
charged
with
foreign
relations.
and
whether
the
report
is
correct
or
not,
it
is
the
view
of
that
agency
which
has
the
responsibility
for
the
foreign
relations
of
united
states
and
it
is
important
because
this
is
the
perception
of
the
state
department
of
the
foreign
relations
question.
it's
not
a
matter
of
a
popularity
contest,
but
it
is
the
view
of
that
agency
charged
with
the
foreign
affairs
of
the
united
states
and
it
is
making
its
comment
that
it
regards
the
imposition
of
these
taxes
as
an
event
which
could
have
an
impact
upon
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
well,
we
made
in
our
brief
a
tonnage
clause
argument
and
it's
there.
i
don't
really
intend
to
elaborate
on
that.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
that's
correct.
it
would
be
an
absolute
test.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
it
is
a
possible
argument
which
if
one
looks
at
the
impact
of
the
tax
and
we
find
that
the
tax
can
apply
only
because
of
the
repeated
events
of
importation
and
exportation.
now,
we
do
think
there
is
an
argument
there
that
the
court
has
said
we
will
not
look
to
the
mere
label
on
a
tax.
we
will
look
to
its
effect.
we
would
argue
that
even
though
this
is
a
general
property
tax,
it
applies
solely
because
of
this
transit
situation
and
in
that
sense
we
think
there
is
an
argument
that
it
could
be
considered
a
tonnage
duty.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
no,
that
was
not
raised
specifically
in
the
california.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
because
it
is
a
law
of
the
country
and
the
fact
that
â€“
mr.
peter
l.
briger
the
treaty
is
a
law
of
the
country.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
yes,
it
is
a
treaty.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
conceivably
it
does,
i'm
not
â€“
i
am
not
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
well
again
under
this
concept
that
it
talks
about
duties
or
taxes
of
any
type
whatsoever
by
reason
of
import
and
we
believe
that
there
is
an
argument
that
can
be
made
that
the
tax
applies
only
by
virtue
of
the
repeated
import
and
export
of
the
containers
but
we
would
--
we
look
to
the
treaty
and
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
yes
justice
brennan.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
if
it
is
inapplicable
treaty.
we
find
more
support
in
the
treaty
as
a
general
expression
of
the
federal
government's
interest
in
promoting
the
usage
of
containers.
we
think
there
is
an
argument
that
the
language,
any
taxes
whatsoever
by
reason
of
export
can
be
extended
to
the
application
of
this
tax
in
this
case,
but
we
find
more
solace
from
the
treaty
in
expressing
the
views
of
the
federal
government
to
expand
and
nurture
the
use
of
containers
as
a
new
technological
development
in
the
shipment
of
cargo.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
this
is
a
great,
this
â€“
mr.
peter
l.
briger
justice
white,
it
is
very
difficult
in
dealing
a
codified
world.
the
drafters
of
tax
statutes
in
their
attempts
to
deal
with
each
specific
problem
is
one
of
the
criticisms
and
that's
why
the
tax
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
your
honor,
the
reason
why
i
believe
that
there
was
not,
was
that
the
perception
at
the
time
the
convention
was
entered
into
was
that
these
were
properly
dealt
with
under
the
home
port
doctrine,
that
would
be
the
our
best
analysis
of
the
situation.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
well,
the
container
conventions
began
to
be
negotiated
in
the
1960s
as
containers
began
to
be
used
at
that
time.
the
1962,
convention
was
executed
by
certain
of
the
signatory
states
in
the
1960s,
i
believe
the
united
states
became
a
party
to
the
treaty
in
1972,
but
we
feel
that
the
lack
of
any
specificity
in
the
container
is
due
to
the
general
understanding
at
the
times
that
the
home
port
doctrine
eliminated
this
type
of
tax
and
certainly
california
in
that
period
by
following
the
sas
case
certainly
felt
that
way
and
it
would
appear
that
to
the
drafters
of
this
type
of
treaty
that
there
was
no
need
to
put
in
this
provision
and
i
believe
the
amici,
the
foreign
and
domestic
airlines
make
certain
points
to
that
affect
in
their
brief
that
this
was
the
understanding.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
indeed.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
yes,
for
instance
japan
not
only
that
the
trial
court
find
that
japan
applied
a
home
port
doctrine
but
we
submitted
to
this
court
a
translation
of
the
property
tax
law
of
japan.
now
in
that
law,
owners
of
personal
property
such
as
containers,
a
japanese
company
is
required
to
register
that
property
at
the
place
of
its
principle
place
of
business
in
japan
and
a
tax
of
1.4%
is
imposed
by
japan
upon
the
value
of
the
property
as
listed
in
that
register
of
assets.
so
japan
certainly
follows
a
home
port
doctrine.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
it
seemed
to
be
the
practice
your
honor
and
that
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
that
for
more
than
200
years,
states
have
not
levied
personal
property
taxes
on
things
such
as
airplanes.
in
the
one
case
where
it
was
attempted
in
california
we
have
the
sas
case.
we
find
that
we
feel
it,
the
michelin
case
that
in
michelin
and
washington
stevedores,
there
was
a
coalescing
of
many
of
the
common
principles,
but
they
were
clear
to
indicate
that
property
in
transit
even
if
a
tax
was
levied
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis
would
be
considered
to
violate
both
the
import-export
and
the
commerce
clause
and
i
think
that's
the
exact
situation
that
we
are
dealing
with
here.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
in
michelin,
these
containers
are
not
containers
with
wheels.
they
are
just
boxes
and
they
are
shipped
in
these
vessels
which
are
specifically
designed
to
handle
it.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
by
rail
or
truck
your
honor,
they
carried
flat
bed
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
no
they
are
not
themselves,
they
hold
on
trailers.
but
just
in
response
to
another
question
that
judge
rehnquist
had
raised.
while
the
court
has
never
dealt
with
a
situation
imposing
the
property
taxes
upon
foreign-owned
instrumentalities,
it
should
be
noted
that
none
of
the
apportionment
cases
such
as
pullman's
palace
versus
pennsylvania,
ott
versus
mississippi
or
braniff
dealt
with
foreign-owned
instrumentalities.
the
key
to
our
position
is
that
neither
this
court,
the
federal
government
nor
the
states
have
the
right
to
require
foreign
governments
to
accept
the
apportionment
approach.
it
might
be
logical
if
they
did
and
it
might
well
be
something
that
could
be
done
through
treaty.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
i
believe
it,
i
believe
it
could.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
no
it
could
not
--
not
the
imposition
of
this
tax,
but
it
could
not
require
foreign
governments
to
accept
apportionment
as
a
means
of
the
international
taxation
of
these
containers.
we
don't
have
that
right,
your
honor,
the
federal
government.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
no,
i
believe
that
this
question
can
be
reached
only
by
the
court.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
yes,
your
honor
in.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
no
but
in
the
200.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
no
it
has
to
be,
it
has
to
be
hold
by
something
or
carried
by
something,
but
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
there
is
a
great
deal
of
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
well,
for
want
of
a
better
term,
justice
marshall,
it
is
referred
to
as
an
instrumentality.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
like
a
box
and
i
suppose
an
airplane
or
a
vessel
is
something
like
a
box.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
no
this
box
has
to
be
hold,
but
we
are
analogizing
it
to
vessels
or
to
aircraft
from
the
standpoint
that
it
carries
things
in
commerce
and
it
may
not
have
its
own
motive
power.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
the
containers
your
honor,
it's
not
my
understanding
that
they
are
carried
to
a
warehouse
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
i
think
that's
perhaps
a
different
case
because
our
containers
are
constantly
in
transit.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
if
the
container
would
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
case
and
in
your
illustration
the
container
could
be
used
as
a
warehouse,
the
containers
that
we
are
dealing
with
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
if
it
were
sedentary
i
suppose
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
if
it
were
continually
there,
yes
i
would
think
that
there
are
many
distinctions.
i
mean,
it
is
almost
like
when
an
item
of
personal
property
becomes
affixed
to
the
real
estate
it
becomes
real
estate
under
the
law
and
i
suppose
a
container
would
be
no
different
from
any
other
piece
of
personality
that
became
affixed
to
the
reality.
it
would
depend
on
the
usage.
i
think
that's
a
different
case
because
in
our
case
the
average
stay
of
the
containers
were
stipulated
by
the
parties
to
be
less
than
three
weeks
per
visit
and
they
were
continually
in
motion.
i
don't
disagree
that
if
the
container
were
affixed
to
the
real
estate,
it
could
be
a
warehouse
or
building
or
anything
else.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
it's
part
of
the
danger.
it
isn't
merely
a
question
of
double
taxation.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
long
and
well
established
reliance
interests
of
foreign
governments
very
similar
to
what
the
court
admonished
--
mr.
peter
l.
briger
well
what
--
we
feel
that
california
can
do
two
things.
number
one,
there
are
constitutionally
viable
means
of
collecting
the
value
of
services,
benefits
or
opportunities
that
can
be
imposed
within
the
constraints
of
this
particular
situation
namely
to
levy
specific
user
charges
or
secondly
the
states
are
not
without
the
means
to
attempt
to
influence
the
federal
government
to
seek
a
new
rule.
mr.
peter
l.
briger
well,
we
think
because
of
the
foreign
relations
aspects
of
it,
whether
there
is
going
to
be
retaliatory
taxes
imposed
is
something
better
left
to
the
state
department
and
not
to
be
determined
by
any
number
of
local
governments.
the
question
of
retaliation
or
reciprocity
is
the
manner
in
which
this
international
carriage
of
goods
and
cargo
has
been
dealt
with.
so
that
if
we
are
going
to
have
either
reciprocal
exemptions
or
retaliatory
taxes
with
our
foreign
trading
partners
that
clearly
seems
to
be
a
matter
of
exclusive
federal
concern.
thank
you.
