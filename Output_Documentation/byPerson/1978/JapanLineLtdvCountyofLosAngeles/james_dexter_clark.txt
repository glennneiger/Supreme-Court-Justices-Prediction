mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
get
right
down
to
the
nature
of
the
home
port
doctrine
if
i
may.
the
home
port
doctrine
in
essence
says
that
there
will
be
no
taxation
of
a
movable
piece
of
property
by
a
state
which
is
visited
unless
actual
situs
is
acquired
there.
in
actual
fact
the
dispute
between
the
appellants
and
the
appellees
in
this
case
does
not
involve
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
the
home
port
doctrine,
but
only
the
exception
thereto
and
that
is
whether
or
not
there
will
be
indeed
an
exception
created
by
continuous
presence
by
means
of
rotation
or
whether
each
piece
of
property
must
exist
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction
all
year
long,
that
is
the
nub
of
the
real
home
port
doctrine,
that
is
the
nub
of
the
dispute
in
this
case
and
it
is
also
the
nub
of
the
enactment,
that
is
the
treaty
dispute
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
proceed
directly
to
the
treaties
involving
friendship
commerce
and
navigation
and
specifically
that
one
involving
japan.
the
first,
mr.
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
justice
stevens,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
quite
frankly
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
quite
frankly
mr.
justice
stevens
it
would
depend
upon
whether
that
presence
was
created
there.
if
a
vessel
came
into
the
tax
i'm
sorry
it
depends
upon
two
things
not
only
the
presence,
but
it
also
depends
upon
the
benefits
and
protections
conferred
by
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
if
those
vessels
came
in
and
stayed
there
for
an
average
of
three
weeks
and
came
in
on
a
rotated
basis,
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned
i
believe
there
is
no
difference
whatsoever.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
if
the
continuous
presence
were
there
and
if
the
benefits
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
per
individual
ship
is
that
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
would
be
the
case
i
think.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
problem
in
the
hays
of
course
not
only
had
it
not
considered
the
apportioned
idea,
but
in
addition
there
was
no
continues
presence
cited
in
that
case.
there
was
no
year
long
presence
cited
in
that
case.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
the
tax
was
a
full
ad
valorem
tax
and
the
tax
dealt
with
not
an
apportion
tax,
but
a
tax
on
each
ship
as
it's
full
value
and
that
is
i
think
the
real
distinction
in
terms
of
hays'
factual
situation
and
this
one,
that
we
do
not
pretend
that
we
can
tax
each
container
on
a
full
ad
valorem
basis.
we
contend
that
we
can
tax
the
continuous
presence
of
all
of
those
containers
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction
and
i
think
that's
a
key
difference
because
when
pullman's
palace
car
went
to
that
difference,
it
said
when
it
involved
the
situation
of
foreign
versus
domestic
carriers
or
international
versus
non-international
carriers
it
was
looking
at
a
time
i
believe
when
there
were
very
few
fleets
of
ships
under
one
ownership
and
it
was
looking
at
a
single
presence
or
a
single
item
at
a
time
and
the
opinion
in
pullman's
palace
car
said
that
while
those
instrumentalities
of
foreign
commerce
in
no
way
maintained
themselves
as
a
continuous
presence
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction,
that
is
totally
different.
while
at
the
same
time
of
course
pullman's
did
recognize
the
idea
that
instrumentalities
of
foreign
commerce
as
well
as
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce
may
be
taxed.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
that
can
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
think
the
logical
extension
of
that
is
if
you
take
it,
if
you
say
that
the
railroad
cars
in
pullman's
palace
cars
may
be
taxed
then
i
believe
that
if
the
benefits
and
protections
are
there,
you
are
not
taxing
commerce
as
such.
you
are
recouping
the
return
on
the
benefits
and
protections
conferred
and
the
burdens
on
the
local
government,
distinction
yes
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
it
may
have
and
it
may
have
a
separate
port
authority.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes
mr.
justice
marshall
that
is
true
too
and
also
ports
have
their
own
fire
fighting
equipment
as
the
appellants
pointed
out
as
far
as
long
beach
is
concerned
whether
or
not
the
fee
imposed
by
the
port
would
negate
the
idea
of
a
benefits
and
protections
test
as
applied
to
a
vessel,
i
don't
know
because
i
have
not
looked
into
the
question
of
a
local
jurisdictions
benefits
and
protections
as
applied
to
a
vessel.
i
do
know
that
if
the
benefits
and
protections
are
there
then
i
believe
that
it
is
the
local
government's
right
to
recoup
that
particular
burden
on
them.
i
admit
that
the
containers
i
think
are
quite
distinguishable
from
vessels
in
that
they
more
clearly
supply
those
burdens
on
local
government.
they
go
through
our
roads,
they
stay
here
for
at
least
there
for
an
average
of
three
weeks,
they
entail
polite
lease
and
fire
protection
by
the
municipalities
as
well
as
the
county
throughout
their
state.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
in
more
probability,
no,
as
long
as
that
truck
has
the
same
kind
of
existence
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes
it
would,
your
honor,
quite
frankly
it
would
with
the
added
weight.
there
would
be
a
substantial
difference
in
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no,
it
is
not
your
honor,
that
is
absolutely
true.
but
mr.
chief
justice
when
we
arrive
at
the
particular
point
in
question
i
think
we
have
all
of
those
benefits
and
protections
which
we
have
logically
cited
in
our
brief
and
it
is
that
the
appellant's
burden
to
dispute
that
and
to
reject
the
fact
that
the
services
to
which
the
tax
is
put
does
not
apply
to
them
and
i
think
we
have
logically
shown
that
they
do
apply
to
them
that
fire
and
police
protection
applies
to
them,
that
the
flood
control
applies
to
them,
that
all
of
the
other
services
which
aid
the
appellants
in
coming
into
our
taxing
jurisdiction
as
an
enterprise
and
earning
profit
should
be
recouped
by
the
local
government.
once
you
get
beyond
that
point
and
we
look
into
the
treaties
itself
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
federal
government
has
indeed
enacted
a
particular
point
in
order
to
disturb
that
relationship,
i
think
it
is
wise
to
look
at
the
federal,
the
friendship
commerce
and
navigation
treaties,
and
the
start
of
that
inquiry
of
course
is
article
22
paragraph
4
where
a
national
treatment
is
defined
differently
for
states
and
territories
than
it
is
for
the
united
states
itself
and
by
treaty
national
treatment
does
not
say
no
less
than
treatment
you
will
give
other
people.
it
says
that
national
treatment
equals
the
same
treatment
you
give
enterprises
from
other
states
and
relating
that
national
treatment
to
the
articles
which
are
key
in
this
particular
case
we
run
up
against
the
import
export
provision
in
article
14,
paragraph
5
which
says
you
will
give
national
treatment
in
all
respects
to
import
and
export.
in
article
19,
paragraph
3
you
will
give
national
treatment
and
equal
treatment
to
vessels
coming
into
your
territory
and
in
article
16,
paragraph
1
you
will
give
national
treatment
with
regard
to
internal
taxes.
i
believe
that
the
friendship
commerce
and
navigation
treaties
thereby
show
that
the
states
that
the
federal
government
even
if
we
admit
the
federal
power
to
exist
to
exempt
from
the
state
taxation
without
taking
the
responsibility
for
the
services
provided
even
if
we
say
that
power
exists
in
the
federal
government
we
have
problem
with
regard
to
the
fcn
treaties
and
one
would
believe
that
in
light
of
the
apportionment
statements
in
the
fcn
treaties,
in
light
of
the
particular
statements
with
regard
to
the
import
export
and
vessels
and
internal
taxes
that
some
demonstrable
showing
with
regard
to
the
container
convention
would
be
present.
if
the
container
convention
is
cited
as
apparent
overruling,
the
fcn
treaties
that
some
positive
showing
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
secretary's
authority
under
19
u.s.c.
1322
(a)
sheds
even
additional
light
beyond
that
and
that
is
that
the
secretary
has
the
authority
with
regard
to
all
the
instrumentalities
of
commerce
which
come
from
foreign
countries
to
say
that
they
will
be
exempt
from
the
ordinary
customs
laws.
now,
if
we
say
that
this
non-discriminatory
uniform
property
tax
is
indeed
a
customs
law
then
i
think
we
say
that
practically
every
general
tax
in
the
country
is
a
customs
law.
i
find
no
illusion
to
property
taxes
in
19
u.s.c.
whatsoever.
i
find
no
illusion
to
property
taxes
in
the
customs
convention
or
the
container
convention,
which
i
believe
ought
to
be
present,
if
we
are
going
to
have
such
an
impact
which
was
acknowledged
in
the
fcn
treaties
to
be
the
other
way.
we
would
have
something
explicit
in
the
container
convention
and
to
simply
say
that
property
is
taxed
by
reason
of
importation,
simply
because
it
comes
into
the
taxing
jurisdiction,
is
to
say
that
every
tax
on
very
piece
of
foreign
property
is
immune.
now,
the
idea
is
that
in
essence
what
the
appellants
are
really
--
the
logic
of
the
appellant's
position
is
that
because
there
is
a
danger
of
multiple
taxation
we
should
not
tax
this
property,
which
has
exactly
the
same
kind
of
benefits
and
burden
relationship
as
any
other
property
continuously
existing
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction
that
is
not
shown
to
be
wrong
by
the
appellants
of
the
united
states
or
anyone.
the
united
states
relies
on
a
custom
of
international
law
and
they
prove
half
of
it.
they
say
that
some
countries
do
not
tax
our
property
going
into
their
jurisdiction,
but
they
do
not
prove
the
other
half.
they
do
not
say
that
they
have
personal
property
tax
structure
in
their
country
and
therefore
they
made
some
kind
of
exception.
they
do
not
say
that
they
do
not
recoup
these
matters
by
other
kinds
of
fees
or
taxes.
they
simply
say
that
when
it
gets
down
to
personal
property
taxes,
most
of
the
countries
don't
impose
them
and
then
they
fight
a
few
exceptions
and
that
is
the
30-day
rule,
the
90-day
rule
in
afghanistan.
one
would
therefore
that
since
we
have
a
30-day
rule
on
the
customs
laws
of
other
countries
that
therefore
california
could
tax
as
the
containers
were
here
over
30
days.
now,
we
do
have
a
question
mark
in
the
factual
stipulation,
the
average
is
3
weeks
no
less
than
6
months.
it
is
quite
possible
that
many
of
those
containers
over
here
over
30
days,
we
don't
know,
but
the
very
idea
is
that
if
they
are
then
california
would
be
going
along
reciprocity
with
those
nations
who
imposed
--
which
impose
a
30-day
rule.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
not
simply
the
power
to
prohibit
that
the
united
states
or
the
solicitor
general
seeks.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
right.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
right
mr.
justice
brennan
what
i
believe
it
goes
two
ways.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
think
that
congress
can
prohibit
perhaps.
this
particular
levy
in
the
national
interest,
if
it
also
doesn't
take
–
if
it
also
takes
responsibilities
for
the
benefits
and
protections
conferred.
what
the
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
the
solicitor
general
is
urging
this
court
to
adopt
a
position
that
would
say
in
essence
congress
can
exempt
a
piece
of
property
from
state
taxation
whereas
at
the
same
time
it
leaves
the
state
holding
the
bag
for
providing
the
benefits
and
protections
to
that
particular
piece
of
property.
now,
if
it
does
that
in
the
name
of
reciprocity,
it
means
in
essence
saying
well,
do
this
business
man
in
virginia
need
some
help
there
and
he
is
operating
in
japan
therefore
we
are
going
to
confer
a
benefit
on
a
japanese
company
operating
in
california.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
have
--
that
may
be
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
have
a
rough
time
saying
that
a
state
that
provides
general
benefits
and
protections
can
suddenly
say
that
for
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
think
that's
true
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
have
both
sides
to
that
question
that
i
believe
that
number
--
i
do
not
know
that
a
state
could
simply
say
for
one
specific
person,
we
are
not
going
to
protect
you
because
you
don't
pay.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
danger
physically
of
saying
that
for
foreign
cargo
containers,
we
are
not
going
to
protect
them,
when
on
actual
fact,
if
a
fire
breaks
out
it
imperils
other
structures
and
of
course
there
are
the
other
indirect
public
health
versions
which
we
simply
have
to
provide
in
order
to
keep
our
population
at
work.
i
think
that
what
the
solicitor
general
is
an
essence
saying
though
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
the
idea
that
they
don't
have
do
that,
that
they
can
benefit
the
man
in
virginia
ultimately
by
this
reciprocal
thing
without
underwriting
the
california
expense
and
leave
the
california
tax
payers
holding
the
bag.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
believe
that
it
would
either
be
the
commerce
clause
power
over
commerce
or
perhaps
the
treaty
power.
i
quite
frankly
has
a
very
personal
problem.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
if
--
i
hope
that
i
have
answered
the
question
with
regard
to
congress.
i
believe
that
under
its
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce,
regulation
and
taxation
for
benefits
and
protections
conferred
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
because
number
one
regulation
and
taxation
are
two
entirely
different
things.
mr.
justice
stewart
we
exist,
at
least
i
hope,
we
exist
in
the
federal
system.
it
involves
that
the
people
who
are
in
local
to
that
jurisdiction,
i
myself
can
go
to
my
city
counsel
and
say
i
would
like
to
ask
a
question
about
fire
protection.
now,
if
the
united
states
or
congress
or
i
would
like
a
tax
ask
a
question
about
my
property
tax,
why
am
i
paying
more
than
somebody
else?
if
the
city
council
tells
me
that
the
united
states
congress
has
said
that
guy
is
going
to
be
exempted
and
you
have
to
pay
his
bill,
that
i
think
is
right
at
the
heart
of
the
federal
system.
if
we
have
that
federal
system
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
because
the
regulation
of
commerce
is
different
from
the
taxation
of
the
property
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
the
regulation
of
commerce
deals
with
giving
up
toward
--
giving
somebody
a
benefit
and
not
giving
other
people
a
benefit.
the
taxation
of
commerce
was
treated
separately
in
the
constitution
and
gibbons
versus
ogden
recognizes
the
difference
between
taxation
and
regulation
and
we
exist
in
terms
of
the
states
as
narrow
as
their
ambit
has
become,
we
exist
in
terms
of
a
uniform
non-discriminatory
tax
levied
in
return
for
benefits
and
protections
conferred.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
oh!
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
stewart
my
feeling
is
that
if
they
can,
if
they
can
do
it
then
they
must
take
the
responsibility
as
long
as
well
with
as
the
benefits.
in
other
words,
if
the
commerce
clause
says
that
pursuant
to
a
regulation
you
can
disturb
that
relationship
and
take
off
a
tax,
you
have
to
take
the
benefits
and
protections
along
with
it
otherwise
what
you
have
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
justice
burger
if,
i
am
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
very
idea
of
a
tax
or
a
piece
of
property
being
imposed,
my
envision
would
be
perhaps
that
if
the
federal
government
decided
that
all
foreign
goods
would
remain
immune
from
state
taxation
that
in
order
to
proceed
in
the
national
interest
with
national
resources
as
was
done
in
missouri
versus
holland.
they
didn't
use
state
troopers
to
go
out
and
protect
the
birds,
they
used
in
there
federal
officers,
it
become
a
federal
law
that
if
they
use
those
national
resources
in
the
national
interest,
they
have
to
take
both
the
benefits
and
protections
along
with
along
with
the
benefit
of
tax.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
if
there
is
anything
to
be
said
about
that
particular
point,
if
we
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
federal
government
can
make
a
non-discriminatory
tax
into
a
federal
regulation,
then
i
believe
they
have
to
take
the
burdens
with
the
benefits.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
oh!
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
the
idea
if
for
instance
customs
had
sealed
off
an
area
had
bought
a
federal
enclave
and
as
they
do
in
federal
enclaves
mr.
justice
marshall,
as
at
least
in
theory
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no,
it
is
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that's
right.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not.
[attempt
to
laughter]
the
very
idea
though
i
think
that
if
what
i
believe
is
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
what
i
am
saying
is
this
sir.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
think
i
said
that
if
the
federal
--
it
is
logical
to
do
that
if
the
federal
government
claims
the
privilege
of
immunizing
a
piece
of
property
from
tax
which
is
the
recoupment
for
those
benefits
and
protections.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
you
have
to
reach
i
believe
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
you
have
to
reach
the
congressional
power,
you
have
to
at
least
say
that
congress
can.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
if
you
rely
on
the
enactments
of
the
treaties.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no
sir,
no
sir
of
course
not.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
did
not
mean
to
anyway
say
that
the
court
had
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
think
under
the
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
logically
under
the
federal
system,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
think
only.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
if
they
have
a
continuous
presence
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction
and
i
think
that
those
benefits
and
protections
are
there
then
the
tax
i
think
automatically
follows.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no
sir,
it
did
not.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
assuming
what
pullman's
palace
car
says
mr.
chief
justice,
then
the
other
side
though
too
is
that
the
regulation
that's
what
gibbons
versus
ogden
i
think
is
all
about.
it
says
first
of
all
that
you
cannot
regulate,
you
cannot
prohibit
that
man
from
going
up
that
river,
but
that
you
can
tax
it.
you
can
go
out
there
and
get
a
return
for
the
benefits
and
protections
conferred.
and
i
think
that's
true
as
long
as
the
continuous
presence
and
those
benefits
and
protections
are
there.
i
believe
that
in
this
case
the
continuous
presence
and
the
fact
situation
that
we
have
here
fully
support
and
the
appellants
have
not
refuted
that
the
benefits
and
protections
are
there.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
have
gotten
into
trouble
with
the
court
on
this.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
would
be
proper
under
the
federal
system.
i
think
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no
sir
it
would
not.
i
think
there
are
limitations
on
congressional
authority
and
what
i
was
getting
to
if
i
may
emphasize
this
once
again
is
that
the
logic
of
the
federal
system
requires
that
if
the
federal
government
take
the
tax
power
away
from
the
states,
they
must
also
have
a
responsibility
before
those
benefits
and
protections
which
the
state
confers
in
one
way
or
another.
now
that's
the
logic
to
me
of
the
federal
system
and
the
relationship
between
those
benefits
and
protections
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
the
constitutional
argument
is
that
there
is
no
power
in
congress
to
do
that
in
the
first
place.
i
speak,
economically
in
the
other
terms.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
meant
to
say
if
they
could
do
it
i
believe
that
that
would
follow
and
i
believe
that
is
an
economic
argument
following
i
think
the
federal
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
mr.
justice
stevens?
mr.
james
dexter
clark
no
sir,
they
are
not.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
i
think
that
quite
frankly
tactically
that's,
i'm
sorry
it
is
true,
the
enactment
is
not
there.
mr.
justice
stevens
perhaps
that
is
a
luxury
for
those
of
us
in
public
law
have
to
strenuously
urge
those
things
which
we
feel
are
right
and
sound
and
perhaps
that
is
where
i
am,
but
i
believe
that
both
arguments
are
quite
correct.
i'm
concerned,
mr.
justice
stevens,
if
the
federal
government
has
that
power
as
to
what
is
going
to
happen
in
terms
of
our
federal
system
in
terms
of
state
and
federal
relationships.
i
honestly
believe
that
the
states
have
a
purpose
and
i
say
it
has
been
constructed
by
probably
correct
interpretations
of
the
commerce.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
justice
stevens
the
idea
of
course
is
that
they
have
not
been
here
for
a
couple
of
100
years.
california
has
exercised
i
guess
it
is
totally
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
well,
under
california
law
we
cannot.
the
constitutional
--
state
constitutional
provision
which
the
appellants
are
alluded
to
has
been
interpreted
as
not
corresponding
with
equal
protection
standards
and
therefore
the
exemption
was
applied
by
the
court
to
all
vessels.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
if
the
continuous
presence
is
there,
actually
on
the
scheduled
airlines
i
think
that
ott
versus
mississippi
barge
lines
would
go
along
with
a
regular
presence
as
well
as
continuous,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
they
have
their
own
interior
containers
which
are
however
are
not
used
in
the
same
way
as
these
containers,
they
are
simply
taken
off
the
airplane,
perhaps
taken
to
the
warehouse
often
unloaded
directly
at
the
airport
and
kept
with
the
airplane
itself.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
oh
yes
mr.
justice
brennan
i
think
there
was
a
question
to
whether
we
could
tax
the
aircraft
and
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
think
so.
the
aircraft,
i
hate
to
use
this
touching
language,
but
the
aircraft
do
come
into
only
one
place
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction
and
that
place
is
covered
by
well
like
the
new
york
airport
authority,
los
angeles
has
the
same
sort
of
thing
and
is
covered
by
airport
fees.
when
the
container
comes
in
here,
the
fee
in
the
port
is
imposed
on
the
vessel
whether
it
has
containers
or
not.
when
the
containers
come
here
they
put
the
in
and
through
and
to
destinations
and
from
destinations
throughout
the
taxing
jurisdiction
and
that
gives
you
the
assurance
i
believe
that
the
benefits
and
protections
and
the
tax
relationship
is
there,
whereas
with
the
airplane
perhaps
that
benefits
and
tax
relationship
is
a
little
bit
more
conjectural,
simply
just
hard.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that's
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
they
could
indeed,
but
only
in
sense
of
its
apportioned
presence.
we
are
not
going
–
mr.
james
dexter
clark
only
in
keeping
with
its
apportioned
presence.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
do.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
the
pullman
case
has
been
followed
by
every
state
imposing
personal
property
taxes
ever
since
its
inception,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
sir,
i
think
the
difference
between
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
yes
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
there
are
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
believe
that
it
can
be
decided
that
way
mr.
justice
marshall,
that's
correct
and
i
don't
mean
to
assert
or
push
anybody
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
what
i'm
saying
in
essence
is
that
the
apportionment
doctrine
logically
applies
to
the
benefits
and
protections
conferred
to
all
of
these
instrumentalities.
if
as
i
say,
the
port
authority
and
these
things
follows.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
oh
no
sir,
i'll
be
satisfied.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
and
--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
[attempt
to
laughter]
the
home
port
doctrine
then
deals
with
the
exceptions
to
it
and
the
argument
regarding
the
home
port
doctrine
deals
with
that
exception
by
means
of
apportionment.
the
friendship,
commerce
and
navigation
treaty
stands
i
believe
soundly
for
the
proposition
that
both
national
treatment
and
apportionment
are
the
expectations
which
the
appellants
received
when
they
came
here.
there
are
many
treaties
involving
prevention
of
double
taxation
with
regard
to
federal
income
taxes
and
the
like
and
the
friendship
commerce
and
navigation
treaties
i
believe
were
intended
to
fill
a
general
rule
as
to
all
other
taxes
including
state
and
local
taxes
which
are
specifically
mentioned
there
in
and
in
which
in
essence
show
that
the
national
treatment
and
the
very
idea
of
apportionment
are
encountered
by
the
people
who
involved
in
negotiating
that
treaty
and
accepted
both.
so
i
think
the
enactments
of
the
executive
and
of
the
federal
government
indicate
that
this
tax
is
proper.
the
container
convention
contains
no
explicit
language
and
as
i
say
if
we
contend
that
the
taxation
by
reason
of
importation
means
that
this
tax
is
covered
by
that
language
that
all
taxes
are
covered
by
that
language.
thank
you
mr.
justice,
thank
you.
