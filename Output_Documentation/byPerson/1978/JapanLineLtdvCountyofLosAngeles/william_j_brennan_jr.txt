justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
briger,
are
you
making
either
an
import-export
or
tonnage
clause
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
if
the
tonnage
clause
prohibited
this,
there
will
be
nothing
congress
could
do
about
it,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
briger
may
i
get
back
to
the
question
my
brother
blackmun
put
to
you
before?
i
think
he
told
us
that
in
the
california
courts,
you
argued
the
treaty
of
friendship,
but
--
between
the
united
states
and
japan,
but
the
united
states
does
not
support
you
in
that
argument
here,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
it
does
support
you
though
in
the
customs
convention
on
containers
argument,
but
you
never
raised
that
in
california
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
my
brother
blackmun
asked
you
before,
then
how
can
you
be
heard
on
the
customs
conventional
argument
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
treaty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
is
a
treaty
as
i
recall
it,
am
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
but
it
deals
only
with
import
duties
and
taxes,
import
prohibitions
and
that
sort
of
thing,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
type
of
tax
we
are
dealing
with
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it
is
an
inapplicable
treaty,
i
take
it
that
should
end
the
case,
shouldn't
it,
in
your
favor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
is
inapplicable
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
certainly
considered
import
taxes
because
they
use
that
expression
in
the
convention,
but
was
there
any
discussion
at
all
in
connection
with
the
convention
of
the
type
of
tax
we
are
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
was
it
negotiated,
this
convention?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
the
containers
here
as
handler
containers
were
in
michelin?
as
i
recall
in
michelin,
they
arrived
that
the
where
it
was,
that
state,
north
carolina,
was
it,
loaded
with
tires
and
were
unloaded
and
stored
in
a
warehouse.
some
of
them
coming
in
from
nova
scotia
simply
took
trailers
on
tax
tractors
to
then
ship
them
to
nova
scotia
that
way,
but
overseas
they
took
the
wheels
off
in
france,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
once
get
to
california,
how
do
they
get
to
the
other
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
themselves,
they
are
trailers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
jones,
your
footnote
14
suggests
another
answer.
it
is
under
article
11
of
the
customs
convention
on
containers.
containers
are
used
even
occasionally
for
domestic
traffic
may
be
taxed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
would
suggest
may
be
another
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
your
footnote
14
mean?
it
is
yours,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
that
the
customs
convention,
11
says
containers
used
even
occasionally
for
domestic
traffic
may
be
subjected
to
duties
and
taxes
even
in
that
nation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
jones,
the
government
makes
neither
a
tonnage
nor
import-export
clause,
are
not
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
rely
exclusively
on
the
commerce
clause
right
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
tell
me
mr.
clark,
if
you
prevail,
could
congress
constitutionally
prohibit
this
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
my
question
is
if
you
prevail?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
prevail
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
could
congress
nevertheless
prohibit
the
county
from
imposing
this
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
it
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
while
you
mean
mr.
clark,
the
federal
government,
if
it
were
to
exempt
these
containers
would
have
at
least
provide
the
county
is
the
same
--
with
the
amount
that
it
losses
in
taxes
in
order
to
help
support
the
police
and
fire?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
you
didn't
answer
my
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
clark
you
would
say
you
could
tax
not
only
the
containers
but
the
aircraft
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
mr.
clark
if
you
are
right
and
you
could
tax
the
aircraft,
i
take
it
if
japan
airlines
has
scheduled
stop
at
los
angeles.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
another
scheduled
stop
at
chicago
and
another
scheduled
stop
at
new
york,
at
(inaudible)
that
illinois
and
new
york
could
also
tax
the
aircraft?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
presence
of
what?
