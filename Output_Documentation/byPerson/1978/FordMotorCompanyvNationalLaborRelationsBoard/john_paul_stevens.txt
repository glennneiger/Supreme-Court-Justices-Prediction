mr.
kammholz
supposing
a
company
or
an
employer
had
a
rule
requiring
employees
to
eat
in
the
company
cafeteria,
would
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
such
a
rule
be
mandatory
subject
to
bargaining?
justice
john
paul
stevens
imagine
if
you
had
told
someone
in
the
army
or
the
navy
that
the
kind
of
food
they
had
to
eat
was
the
trivial
condition
of
the
employment
they
might
not
agree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
there
would
be
a
bargain
of
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
might
be
if
ford
supplied
them
and
insisted
that
their
supplies
be
used
that
wouldn't
shock
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kammholz,
would
you
help
me
a
little
bit
on
the
practical
aspect
of
this.
assume
we
were
to
hold
it
was
a
mandatory
subject,
would
that
mean
that
every
time
they
change
the
price
of
coffee
they'd
have
to
give
you
a
notice
--
they
give
--
you'd
have
to
give
the
union
and
they'd
have
a
right
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
do
it
during
the
summer,
i
gather.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they're
pretty
hot
for
leaving
food
in
the
locker,
aren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
storage
area
a
refrigerator?
justice
john
paul
stevens
storage
for
--
for
the
milk
or
something,
you
couldn't
do
it,
end
of
summer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
you
don't
even
have
to
eat
if
you're
really
want
to
(inaudible).
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kammholz
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
share
justice
powell's
inquiry
and
i
--
perhaps
i
should
ask
mr.
come
this
question
but
i
gather
that
the
--
your
opponents
are
not
here
defending
the
seventh
circuit
opinion.
they're
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
defending
the
result
but
i
certainly
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
don't
read
their
brief
to
go
along
with
the
theory
expressed
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
its
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
not
organizing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
you
had
more
than
one
union?
what
if
you
have
more
than
one
union?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
also
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
also
going
to
want
to
bargain
about
what's
going
into
the
menu.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
won't
be
any
good
to
keep
the
price
the
same,
let
them
--
give
you
half
a
scoop
of
ice
cream.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
all
seriousness.
it's
inherent
in
your
position
that
you
can
bargain
about
the
menu
as
well
as
the
price,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
pardon
you.
