justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
just
the
last
of
those
phrases
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
conceitedly
is
not
--
well
there
is
a
claim
as
much
as
wage,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
concededly
it's
not
hours.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
although,
death
sentence
are
broader
--
it's
a
broader
generic
question
that
was
sent
down
as
a
question
presented
in
the
company's
certiorari
petition.
justice
potter
stewart
and
maybe
--
but
maybe
the
--
but
maybe
the
answer
to
it
as
suggested
in
the
questions
of
my
brothers
blackmun
and
powell
is,
sometimes
yes,
sometimes
no.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
they
do
effect
clearly
anybody's
definition
of
conditions
of
employment.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
has
no
conclusive
evidence
however
that
that
was
a
mandatory
subject
to
bargaining.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
comes
very
close
to
wages,
there's
a
fringe
benefit.
let's
say
the
demand
were
for
free
lunches,
free
food
which
for
sure
i
would
include
half
price
food.
that's
so
could
close
to
a
wage
demand,
isn't
it?
a
fringe
benefit
so
closely
related
to
compensation
that
i
would
suppose
that
would
clearly
be
a
subject
of
compulsory
bargaining,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
are
wages
in
hours
are
condition
of
employment
by
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
they
use
with
other,
it
makes
clear.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
for
subject
matter
areas.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
they
--
the
board
and
the
courts
do
have
a
job
of
saying
what
subject
matter
areas
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
are
subject
to
compulsory
collective
bargaining.
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
concurring
opinion
was
a
concurring
opinion,
it
wasn't
the
court
laying
down
anything.
it
was
just
a
essay
on
behalf
of
three
members
of
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
claim
is
always
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
bargaining
agreement.
that's
what
a
grievance
is.
