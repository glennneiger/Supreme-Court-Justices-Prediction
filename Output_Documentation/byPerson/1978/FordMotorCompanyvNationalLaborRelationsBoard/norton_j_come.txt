mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
reference
to
justice
blackmun's
question,
the
board's
decision
rest
on
alternative
grounds,
the
board's
basic
position
is
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
rest
on
the
second
alternative
of
the
board's
decision.
the
board's
basic
position
which
is
setout
at
a23
of
the
petition
is
the
position
that
the
board
has
consistently
maintained
for
over
13
years
namely
that
the
services
provided
and
the
prices
at
which
the
services
--
food
services
are
provided
in
in-plant
facilities
such
as
cafeterias
and
vending
machines
are
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
within
the
meaning
of
8
(d)
and
thus
within
the
area
of
mandatory
bargaining.
the
board
in
footnote
11
of
its
decision
went
on
to
set
forth
the
alternative
ground
that
in
any
event
these
matters
were
bargainable
on
the
facts
of
this
case
which
the
board
sets
out
there.
the
seventh
circuit
sustained
the
board
on
the
alternative
ground.
as
far
as
the
board
is
concerned
we
would
prefer
to
win
the
case
on
the
broader
ground.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
if
the
court
will
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
may
well
be
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
board
opposed
certiorari
on
the
ground
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
was
not
necessary
to
reach
the
broader
question.
certiorari
however
was
granted
not
withstanding
our
opposition.
and
now
that
were
here
as
i
say
we
would
prefer
to
get
the
area
cleared
up.
however,
if
--
we
can
only
win
the
case
on
the
narrower
ground,
we'll
take
it
on
their
ground
because
the
board
had
both
grounds
for
its
decision.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
the
logic
of
the
board's
position
would
carry
you
there
although
the
board
has
not
had
occasioned
to
address
that
question
and
that
might
present
questions
of
capital
investment
that
might
get
into
the
reservation
expressed
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
fibreboard.
we
don't
have
that
here.
we
do
have
an
in-plant
facility
that
ford
has
elected
to
provide
for
many,
many
years.
it
has
done
so
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
we
have
to
take
this
on
a
step
by
step
basis.
i
think
the
term
"conditions
of
employment"
is
a
broad
term
congress
entrusted
to
the
board
in
the
first
instance.
the
task
of
giving
content
to
it,
it
does
have
--
it's
not
unlimited
in
the
sense
that
you
cannot
obliterate
the
distinction
between
mandatory
and
permissive
bargaining
subjects
which
the
board
and
this
court
has
recognized.
on
the
other
hand
there
may
be
an
area
as
the
concurring
opinion
in
fibreboard
recognizes
where
decisions
going
to
the
core
of
an
entrepreneurial
control
might
not
be
within
the
area
of
mandatory
bargaining.
but
we
certainly
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
but
we
submit
that
we're
a
long
way
from
that
in
this
case
because
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
you
do
your
honor
and
i
like
to
show
you
that
you're
not
carried
that
far
on
what
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
it's
difficult
for
me
to
tell
you
how
the
board
is
going
to
answer
that
question
because
they
haven't
had
it.
but
conceptually
i'm
--
i
don't
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
look
at
--
i
think
that
there's
no
question
that
everyone
will
agree
that
the
physical
dimensions
of
the
employees'
working
environment
are
mandatory
bargaining
subject.
what
one
hour
--
what
one's
hour
is
--
are
to
be.
the
amount
of
work
that's
expected,
what
periods
of
relief
are
available,
what
safety
practices
are
observed?
now,
petitioner
acknowledges
that
temperature
and
the
quality
of
plant
air
and
restroom
privileges
are
part
of
the
physical
dimensions
of
the
working
environment.
now,
we
submit
that
food
availability
during
the
working
day
is
no
less
a
part
of
the
physical
dimensions
of
the
employees
working
environment
because
as
an
employee
has
to
work
a
full
8-hour
day
without
stopping
to
eat,
he
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
physically
perform
his
job.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
there
is
a
de
minimis
concept.
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
that
would
be
within
the
de
minimis
area
because
i
think
that
congress
made
the
judgment
that
it's
to
be
left
to
the
parties
to
determine
what
is
significant
and
what
is
not
significant
once
you
get
something
that
is
of
vital
concern
to
the
employees
as
part
of
their
working
environment
because
otherwise
you're
on
the
shoal
of
having
the
government,
of
the
board
and
the
courts
sitting
judgment
on
what
is
significant
and
what
is
not
significant.
industrial
experience
has
shown
that
many
things
that
might
to
a
layman
appear
to
be
trivial
have
given
rise
to
industrial
unrest.
now,
let
me
tell
you
what
ford
has
done
here.
they've
not
only
provided
this
facility
and
greatly
subsidized
it,
they've
got
a
provision.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
what?
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
what
i
think
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
facts
are
important
in
showing
that
in
the
--
of
a
--
that
a
--
as
a
matter
of
industrial
experience
it
would
not
be
a
radical
thing
to
hold
that
this
type
of
arrangement
is
a
bargainable
matter.
ford
has
bargained
with
the
union
since
1967
about
the
services
to
be
provided
in
its
in-plant
facilities.
since
1967,
the
local
agreement
between
ford
and
the
union
has
contained
specific
provisions
concerning
vending
machine
and
cafeteria
services
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
such
as
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
i
agree
with
you
that
that
is
not
what
again
accepting
my
premise
that
food
availability
is
part
of
the
physical
conditions
of
the
working
environment.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
submit
that
price
is
an
integral
part
of
the
subject
to
food
services.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
it
would
your
honor.
and
that's
why
it
doesn't
make
too
much
--
it
isn't
too
rational
to
try
to
separate
this
thing
out
because
it
--
you
have
various
gradations
of
it.
and
it
depends
upon
the
conditions
--
well,
it
depends
upon
the
bargain
that
the
parties
are
able
to
work
out.
and
you
have
the
whole
spectrum
from
where
there
would
be
a
subsidy
in
terms
of
the
cost
of
the
food,
the
ware,
its
no
more
than
what
you'd
have
to
pay
elsewhere
but
nonetheless.
it
is
an
important
benefit
because
you've
got
a
plant
here
that
is
a
quarter
mile
square
out
in
the
outline
limits
of
chicago.
you
got
a
lunch
hour
that's
30
minutes.
you
got
breaks
that
are
22
minutes.
they
are
not
permitted
to
leave
the
plant
property
during
the
breaks
and
even
if
they
were
during
the
lunch
hour,
they
couldn't
feasibly
do
it
because
it
takes
10
or
15
minutes
to
go
you're
your
workstation
to
the
parking
lot
to
get
your
car
out
and
then
you
got
to
drive
it
out
and
go
through
a
single
file
gate
and
then
drive
a
couple
of
miles
down
to
hope
to
get
into
one
of
these
cafeteria
of
a
--
fast
food
places
that
are
also
serving
a
lot
of
other
industrial
plants
in
the
same
area.
i
mean,
why
has
the
company
gone
to
the
expense
of
providing
this
substantial
facility
if
it
did
--
if
they
didn't
--
if
they
did
not
regard
it
as
a
very
important
part
of
the
physical
well-being
of
the
worker
while
he
was
on
the
job.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
either
carry
their
food
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
or
they
did
not
eat.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
according
to
the
record
the
finding
is
the
12
out
of
3600
employees
left
the
plant
at
lunch.
but
they
had
to
call
off
the
boycott
once
the
summer
came
because
there
were
no
refrigeration
facilities
for
storing
the
food
which
had
to
be
kept
in
the
locker
rooms.
but
even
if
--
assuming
that
brown
bagging
is
an
alternative,
we
submit
that
the
act
gives
the
employees
and
their
union
representatives
the
right
to
try
to
better
that
alternative.
and
obviously
if
you
can
get
wholesome
food
at
reasonable
prices
at
the
place
of
work
that
is
better
than
having
to,
as
i
explained,
run
somewhere
off
the
plant
premises
or
even
in
many
cases
bringing
your
own
lunch.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
would
be
subject
of
course
to
the
question
as
to
how
much
of
a
capital
investment
that
would
require
and
whether
that
would
then
bring
you
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
it
is
a
mandatory
bargaining,
well,
if
it's
a
mandatory
bargaining
subject
you
cannot
refuse
to
talk
about
it.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
logic
of
the
position
that
i
am
urging
would
lead
to
that
result
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
so.
mr.
norton
j.
come
ibm
on
the
country
club?
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
have
had
cases
where
hunting
lodge
privileges
have
been
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
accorded
to
employees
and
if
it
has
been
accorded
over
--
enough
years
so
that
it
has
become
part
of
the
monuments
of
the
employment
relationship
bargaining
obligation
has
been
found.
i
think
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
i
think
that
the
further
you
get
away
from
the
plant
though,
the
more
tenuous
it
becomes
and
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board's
order
here
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
no.
you
can't
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
first
one
--
the
first
of
all
the
board's
order
here
unlike
the
typical
order,
it
is
entered
in
one
of
these
bargaining
cases,
does
not
require
on
the
company
to
bargain
before
the
price
increase
is
made
effective.
it
is
obligated
to
bargain
only
if
it
is
put
into
--
once
it
has
been
put
into
effect
and
if
the
union
so
requests.
so
presumably
de
minimis
matters
are
not
going
to
be
raised.
but
beyond
that,
the
ingenuity
of
the
parties
is
such
that
they
can
take
care
of
that
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
are
negotiated.
they
could
provide
that
--
they
could
put
a
cap
on
raises
such
as
to
say
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
you
have
more
than
one
union
your
honor
the
problem
is
no
different
than
the
problem
that
you
have
with
respect
to
a
lot
of
other
benefits
like
pensions,
the
seventh
circuit
dealt
with
that
problem
in
the
inland
steel
case.
where
it
--
well,
one
of
the
company's
basic
argument
was
pension
shouldn't
be
bargained
about
because
the
steelworkers,
the
union
that
has
raised
it,
it
all
represents
only
one
bargaining
unit.
we
got
seven
or
right
other
unions
here.
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
this
is
something
that
the
parties
can
work
out
in
collective
bargaining.
it
is
not
a
reason
for
denying
of
benefits
of
the
act
to
an
employee
just
because
they
happen
to
be
in
a
plant
where
there
are
multiple
bargaining
units.
parties
in
practice
negotiate
things
like
that
jointly
with
all
the
unions.
and
i
have
confidence
that
they
would
be
able
to
work
that
out
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
where
--
it
is
conditions
of
employment
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
in
the
weyerhaeuser
case
which
was
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
you
might
have
a
small
chainier
problem
because
if
you
read
the
board
decisions
in
this
area
beginning
with
weyerhaeuser
where
they
squarely
put
it
on
both
conditions
of
employment
and
wages.
and
in
the
ladish
case
which
was
the
one
before
this
case
although
the
board
on
heavily
on
conditions
of
employment.
they
also
--in
their
opinion
indicated
that
it
was
the
equivalent
of
a
tax
free
subsidy.
the
opinion
can
be
read
as
it
--
as
at
least
not
or
completely
being
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
wage
element
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
relied
on
all
the
other
cases
as
their
basis
for
the
decision
here.
the
board
cited
ladish
in
the
earlier
cases
and
again
we
have
the
problem
of
how
clearly
they
have
to
articulate
it.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
conditions
of
employment.
but
we
think
that
that
is
broad
enough
to
cover
this
because
it
is
a
catch
all
that
speaks
in
terms
or
of
--
or
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
and
this
has
an
economic
benefit
to
what
--
even
though
it
might
not
be
technically
wages,
it
would
still
be
enough
to
make
it
a
condition
of
employment.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
and
i
might
say
that
the
legislative
history
which
petitioner
overlooks
but
--
which
is
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
in
the
amicus
brief
indicates
that
the
congress
corollary
visualized
that
conditions
of
employment
would
be
a
broader
term
to
just
mere
working
conditions
because
the
senate
bill
which
is
the
genesis
of
8
(d)
has
originally
proposed,
talked
in
terms
of
working
conditions.
and
senator
wagner
who
was
still
around
at
that
time
expressed
great
concerns
that
that
would
take
out
of
the
area
of
mandatory
bargaining
a
lot
of
things
that
should
be
in
there
and
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
thank
you.
so
as
to
change
the
conditions
of
employment.
