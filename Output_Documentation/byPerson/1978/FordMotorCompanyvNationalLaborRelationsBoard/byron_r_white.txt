better.

think
for
yourself.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it,
i
thought
you
would
say
that
if
a
plant
has
no
food
facilities
at
all
and
just
relies
on
the
restaurants
in
the
area,
that
if
the
union
wants
to
bargain
about
putting
in
a
facility
to
--
it
would
be
a
bargainable
subject.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
part
of
the
bargaining
that
you
would
take
that
the
employer
could
not
refuse
to
talk
about
it,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
under
your
position,
i
--
what's
your
--
your
position
is,
that
under
your
position
i
take
it,
it
would
be
--
he
would
have
to
bargain
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
surely
you'd
have
to
bargain
about
it
if
there
wasn't
a
facility
and
the
employer
decided
that
it
was
a
real
bummer
and
wanted
to
close
it
down.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
--
mr.
come,
i
take
it
before
you
sit
down,
i
take
that
the
board
doesn't
put
you
--
it
doesn't
rest
his
position
on
the
relationship
of
food
prices
to
wages,
it
--
its
working
conditions,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
--
so
we're
not
--
we
--
even
if
we
thought
it
really
was
part
of
wages
or
sort
of
a
fringe
benefit
we
--
we
couldn't
affirm
on
that
basis,
we'd
either
have
to
agree
with
the
board
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
wouldn't
you
--
shouldn't
we
have
a
little
chainier
problem
on
the
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
an
enlarged
chainier
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
--
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
in
a
--
that's
--
that
in
--
that
is
sort
of
like
a
grievance
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
the
board's
order
as
i
take,
if
the
board
--
if
the
employer
raise
the
price
of
milk
or
something
else
and
he
just
put
it
in
like
he
would
be
entitled
to
do
under
the
board's
order
and
the
union
said,
"let's
bargain?"
the
employer
says,
"okay,
let's
bargain."
they
sat
down
and
they
didn't
reach
any
agreement.
the
employer
doesn't
have
to
agree
with
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
have
a
strike
maybe
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
already
been
raised?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
already
raised.
it's
already
been
raised.
they're
gone
to
the
board's
order,
it
would've
been
raised
already.
