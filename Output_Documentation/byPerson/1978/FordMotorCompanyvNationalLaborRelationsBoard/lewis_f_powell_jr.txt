justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
just
this
question.
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
seventh
circuit,
this
case
was
decided
by
it
--
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
presented
in
the
particular
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
questions
are
stated
in
the
briefs
for
all
of
the
counsel,
applied
is
here.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
posed
questions
--
seemed
to
be
posed
in
a
different
way.
is
the
argument
that
we
are
hearing
here
today
directed
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case?
or
is
it
an
argument
directed
to
whether
or
not
the
prices
of
food
served
in
an
in-house
cafeteria
always
are
the
subject
of
mandatory
bargaining?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
the
argument
it
seems
to
me
to
be
addressed
to
whether
or
not
on
any
and
all
circumstances
whatever
they
may
be
that
the
prizes
of
food
in
an
in-company
--
in-house
cafeteria
are
the
subject
of
mandatory
bargaining.
is
that
your
understanding
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
regardless
of
the
facts
and
circumstances.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
would've
thought
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
could
very
considerably
and
apparently
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
thought
so.
it
went
to
a
considerable
detail
as
to
the
facts
and
compared
them
with
other
cases,
produced
charts
at
the
end
of
its
opinion,
itemizing
all
sorts
of
facts.
