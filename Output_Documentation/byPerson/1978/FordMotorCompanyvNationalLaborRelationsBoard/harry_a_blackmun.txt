mr.

would
your
position
here
be
any
different
if
ford

were
operating
this
cafeterias?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
would
take
the
position
that
they
are
not
subject
to
collective
bargaining.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
you
could
fix
all
the
prices?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then
they're
really
captive.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun

i
wonder
why
you
made
reference
to
the
presence
of
restaurants
in
the
area.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
with
a
mile
