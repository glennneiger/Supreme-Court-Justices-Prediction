mr.
come,
let
me
go
back
to
the
board's
basic
position.
suppose
that
in
this
plant
there
were
just
two
vending
machines,
as
to
--
is
there
any
de
minimis
exception
to
the
board's
position
if
ford
wanted
to
take
the
coffee
out
of
those
machines
and
replace
it
with
milk,
is
that
bargainable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
you're
arguing
the
facts
of
it,
and
i'm
trying
to
--

j.
brennan,
jr.
--
stay
with
the
board's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
basic
broad
initial
position.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
you're
suggesting
we
should
do
as
the
seventh
circuit
did
and
decide
this
case
on
the
facts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
the
board's
orders
in
these
areas
anyway
if
they
were
ever
upheld
which
they
haven't
been
until
now,
i
suppose
they
say
that
the
employer
doesn't
have
to
bargain
before
he
puts
in
any
changes.
they
just
put
some
in
and
then
if
the
union
wants
to
bargain,
they
ask.
