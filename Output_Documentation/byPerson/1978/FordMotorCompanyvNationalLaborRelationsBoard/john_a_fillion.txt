mr.
john
a.
fillion
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors
i'd
like
to
focus
briefly
on
a
matter
that
while
it
figured
predominantly
and
prominently
in
the
briefs
has
not
been
discussed
much
here
today
but
i
think
it's
a
very
key
part
of
this
case.
i'm
referring
to
the
really
radical
exaggeration
the
ford
is
giving
vital
effects
test
in
this
case.
and
in
doing
so,
it
is
urging
the
board
and
ultimately
the
courts
to
get
heavily
into
the
matter
of
regulating
the
terms
that
is
the
substantive
terms
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
moreover,
it
is
violating
the
fairly
clear
standards
that
this
court
has
already
articulated
as
to
how
to
judge
whether
or
not
a
bargaining
proposal
is
a
term
and
condition
of
employment.
this
court
or
rather
the
congress
in
a
statute
which
has
been
explicated
over
and
over
by
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
the
labor
board
is
not
to
get
into
the
matter
of
sitting
in
judgment
on
the
substantive
terms
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
that
is
the
board
is
not
to
mix
into
what
goes
into
and
what
stayed
out
--
stays
out
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
right.
that
this
court
--
mr.
john
a.
fillion
right.
this
court
has
laid
down
as
its
basic
rule
those
proposals
are
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
which
are
within
the
employee-employer
relationship.
then
you
mr.
justice
stewart
in
fibre
--
in
your
concurrent
decision
on
fibreboard
went
on
to
say
that
there
is
a
way
of
identifying
those
proposals
that
are
most
obviously
terms
and
conditions
of
the
employment
and
they
are
the
ones
that
are
the
physical
dimensions
of
the
job
environment.
and
i
would
submit
that
those
are
the
two
clear
principles
that
this
court
has
laid
down
in
judging
this
matter
of
what
is
a
term
or
condition
of
employment.
now,
what
ford
would
have
you
do
--
mr.
john
a.
fillion
correct
your
honor.
now,
the
court
has
also
indicated
in
pittsburg
plate
glass
that
there
is
a
very
narrow
area
within
which
the
vital
effect
test
can
be
applied.
but
it
is
a
very
narrow
effect.
when
the
proposal
deals
with
individuals
outside
the
employer-employee
relationship
then
vital
effect
becomes
relevant.
ford
wants
you
and
wants
the
board
to
go
way
beyond
that
and
say
a
vital
effect
applies
not
only
when
the
individuals
involved
are
outside
the
employee-employer
relationship.
vital
effect
applies
and
is
the
standard
even
where
the
individuals
involved
and
even
where
the
subject
matter
is
well
within
the
employer-employee
relationship.
but
in
other
words,
ford
wants
you
to
apply
the
vital
effect
test
wall-to-wall
and
cover
the
entire
gambit
of
section
8
(d)
with
it.
moreover,
even
with
respect
to
the
physical
environment
test
by
which
we
are
to
identify
those
subjects
that
are
most
obviously
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
ford
says
disregard
that,
even
if
we
assume
that
something
is
a
part
of
the
physical
environment
that
makes
no
difference.
the
vital
effect
test
is
what
applies.
now
it
is
in
that
--
mr.
john
a.
fillion
i
think
free
food
is
bargainable.
i
think
50%
is
bargainable.
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
this
is
a
good
illustration
of
the
way
in
which
we
might
handle
the
problem
that
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
that
is,
"how
do
you
handle
something
like
food
prices
that
are
fluctuating
all
the
time?"
there
are
a
number
of
ways.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
well,
that's
--
mr.
john
a.
fillion
one
thing
we
may
do
at
the
bargaining
table
would
be
to
say
we
proposed
that
if
there
are
price
increases
in
the
future,
the
employer
will
pay
half
the
price
increase.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
pardon
me?
mr.
john
a.
fillion
that's
something
that
fluctuates
radically
too
but
there
are
a
lot
of
things
--
mr.
john
a.
fillion
well,
then
maybe
what
we'll
want
to
do
is
what
we
do
in
practically
every
collective
bargain
agreement
we
have.
and
that
is
to
negotiate
that
into
the
grievance
procedure
like
other
things
that
fluctuate
radically
or
rapidly
like
--
mr.
john
a.
fillion
yes.
that's
quite
--
mr.
john
a.
fillion
--
quite
correct
your
honor.
but
probably
we
would
institutionalize
that.
probably
we
would
put
into
the
grievance
procedure.
if
a
price
change
comes
along
or
a
menu
change
or
a
quantity
change,
we
wouldn't
say,
"let's
bargain
now,
we
would
file
a
grievance".
the
grievance
would
go
to
the
first
step,
the
second
step,
maybe
to
arbitration.
maybe
some
fortunate
arbitrator
would
have
the
question
to
resolve
of,
"is
there
enough
mashed
potatoes
or
is
there
enough
gravy?"
but
it
would
be
institutionalized
and
it
wouldn't
be
something
that
would
be
picky
and
get
in
the
way
of
the
parties
and
absorb
a
lot
of
time.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
that's
correct.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
exactly,
a
grievance
procedure
classically
is
the
company
acts,
the
union
reacts
and
that's
exactly
the
way
this
would
be.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
right.
now,
we
would
have
negotiated
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
we
have
now
in
this
local
agreement
provisions
that
they
would
probably
deal
with
a
little
more
institutionalization
of
these
things,
but
there
would
be
rights
and
duties
in
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
based
upon,
they
would
be
negotiated
as
a
result
of
ford's
having
to
bargain
with
us
and
if
there
are
violations
of
that
count,
those
contractual
provisions,
we
would
then
take
it
through
the
grievance
procedure.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
absolutely
right.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
in
the
absence
of
a
provision
on
the
contract
on
the
price
of
milk
--
mr.
john
a.
fillion
--
or
regulating
the
price
of
milk
but
absent
--
anything
on
the
contract
on
there,
we
would
bargain
to
an
impasse
and
ford
would
go
ahead
and
raise
the
price
of
milk
--
mr.
john
a.
fillion
--
to
his
last
proposal.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
that's
correct.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
that
they
could
use
a
lettuce
your
honor?
mr.
john
a.
fillion
we
might
--
yes,
we
will
--
we
could
under
our
rights
raise
quantity,
quality,
selection,
the
whole
gambit.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
sorry
your
honor,
i
missed
your
original
allusion.
excuse
me.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
fillion
thank
you.
