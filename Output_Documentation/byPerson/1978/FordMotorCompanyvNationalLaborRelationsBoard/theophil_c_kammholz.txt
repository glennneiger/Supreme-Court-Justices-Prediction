mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
prices
of
cafeteria
and
vending
machine
food
provided
in
a
manufacturing
plant
to
employees
falls
within
the
term
wages,
hours
or
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
as
said
out
in
section
8
(d)
of
the
act.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
or
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
or
it
may
be
wages.
the
board
has
raised
this
issue
and
i
should
like
to
address
it
late
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
that
would
be
in
the
area
of
wages.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
the
facts
essentially
are
not
in
dispute.
the
ford
plant,
chicago
heights,
illinois,
employs
some
3500
hourly
employees
with
reference
to
the
issue
before
the
court
here.
there
are
two
cafeterias,
five
vending
machine
areas
known
as
cook
cribs.
the
providing
of
food
is
pursuant
to
a
contract
with
a
food
vendor,
ara.
and
over
the
years
the
contract
has
been
in
effect,
the
contractor
has
a
9%
override
on
its
cost
of
food,
labor
and
related
services.
and
in
the
event
of
a
deficit
there
is
provision
for
a
maximum
of
$52,000
a
year
cushion
which
ford
is
obligated
to
pay.
there
is
a
concurrent
provision
that
in
the
event
of
profit,
this
inures
to
ford's
benefit
but
as
one
might
anticipate
there
has
not
been
a
profit
in
recent
years.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no,
it
would
be
identical
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
precisely,
precisely.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
exactly.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
not
in
the
context
of
this
case.
one
can
visualize
a
situation
such
as
presided
in
the
weyerhaeuser
case,
remote
location,
no
opportunity
for
employees
to
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
lumberjacks,
exactly.
but
here
there
are
--
any
number
of
eating
places
outside
the
plant
granted
they
were
utilized
very
infrequently.
here,
in
1976
when
this
--
the
underlying
dispute
arose
the
union
requested
bargaining
on
food
prices
and
services.
the
company
refused.
employees
engaged
in
a
boycott.
and
over
50%
of
the
union
members
from
the
period
early
february
to
june
1976
either
brownbagged,
perhaps
some
of
them
didn't
eat
all
or
others
went
to
the
restaurants
nearby.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
30
minutes
for
lunch
your
honor
and
two
twenty
--
two
minute
rest
periods.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
nearest
restaurant
is
1.6
tenths
miles
away.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no,
i
would
not
concede
that
they're
captive.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
because
some
employees
utilize
the
restaurants
as
the
record
indicates.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
well
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
or
they
could
bring
their
lunch
which
very
many
did.
and
during
the
boycott
presumably
nearly
all
of
them
did
because
the
boycott
was
indulged
by
more
than
50%
of
the
employees.
a
complete
--
a
charge
was
filed
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
upon
ford's
refusal
to
bargain
about
prices
and
services.
the
hearing
was
had
and
the
administrative
law
judge
found
that
factually
and
legally
this
case
was
in
the
context
of
four
other
cases
which
have
addressed
this
issue
of
food
prices.
in
each
of
the
four
other
cases
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
gone
one
way
that
held
that
food
price
is
worse
mandatory
subject
to
bargaining.
and
in
each
case,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
twice
in
the
fourth
circuit,
once
in
the
first
circuit,
in
the
food
machinery
case
and
the
prior
decision
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
ladish
case.
in
each
instance,
the
court
held
that
food
prices
properly
were
not
within
the
meaning
of
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
but
rather
were
remote
from
what
could
viewed
as
the
mainstream
of
the
relationship
of
employer-employee.
in
support
of
that
view
may
i
say
that
over
the
years,
this
court
in
one
case,
the
allied
chemical
workers
case,
circuits
in
other
cases
and
indeed
the
board
have
made
these
distinctions
between
mandatory
and
nonmandatory
subject
to
bargaining.
it's
perfectly
for
instance
that
wages
whether
incentive
or
straight
hourly,
overtime,
seniority,
holiday
pay,
vacation
pay
clearly
relate
to
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
or
indeed
wages
or
hours.
on
the
other
hand,
the
decided
cases
hold
that
such
matters
as
insurance
benefits
for
retired
employees,
a
code
of
ethics
for
employees
coupled
with
penalty
provisions.
the
right
to
a
strike
route
before
a
strike
may
be
called,
a
performance
bond
required
of
the
union
not
to
engage
in
conduct
contrary
to
the
contract
during
its
term
likewise
not
a
mandatory
subject
to
bargaining.
now,
clearly
your
honors
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
drawing
of
the
line.
what
properly
is
encompassed
by
the
requirement
of
the
statute.
mr.
justice
stewart
in
your
concurrence
in
the
fibreboard
case
stated
very
explicitly
that
the
act
is
restrictive
and
it
does
contemplated
--
contemplate
unlimited
bargaining.
indeed
the
legislative
history
supports
this
view
rather
clearly
and
this
is
articulated
in
your
concurring
opinion,
the
views
of
the
board
and
the
unions
to
the
contrary.
when
we're
talking
about
food
prices,
we're
talking
about
one
element
of
the
cost
of
living
along
with
housing,
transportation,
clothing,
the
national
agreement
between
ford
and
the
united
auto
workers
over
the
years
had
has
and
now
contains
a
cost
of
living
provision
so
that
food
prices
on
the
basis
of
cola,
cost
of
living
adjustment
are
already
bargained
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
really
would
be
another
bite
at
the
apple.
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
act
as
set
out
in
this
preamble
does
promote
and
maintain
industrial
peace
to
require
food
bargaining
--
bargaining
of
the
food
prices
would
really
not
encourage
industrial
peace.
indeed
the
uaw
in
its
brief
very
candidly
and
openly
asserts
that
"the
act
contemplates
combat".
this
of
course
is
aviated
by
the
ruling
--
if
this
court
will
pursue
the
rulings
of
the
circuits
prior
to
the
seventh
circuit
decision
in
this
case
that
--
and
i
used
the
phrase
with
some
hesitation
but
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
the
westinghouse
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
this
is
dealing
with
trivialities
in
terms
of
the
employment
relationship.
granted,
food
is
essential
for
life
but
we
consume
it
not
as
employees
but
as
people.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no,
i
think
not.
if
--
to
use
the
logging
camp
example
it
would
make
not
only
complete
sense
there
but
really
would
become
an
integral
part
of
the
job.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
ultimately,
but
that's
not
our
case.
there
because
of
the
circumstances
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
i
think
the
theory
mr.
chief
justice
burger
goes
one
step
beyond.
and
that
is
in
order
to
have
employees
at
all
in
this
logging
camp
there
must
be
some
provision
for
food.
but
here
again,
this
is
outside
the
mainstream
of
the
american
industrial
life
and
is
exception
and
not
the
rule.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
a
period
of
time
for
lunch
is
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
--
this
is
within
the
context
of
hours
of
employment.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no,
i
didn't
say
it
was
trivial.
the
fourth
circuit
did
it.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
fourth
circuit
did.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
probably
so,
but
that
same
person
wouldn't
have
much
choice
and
whether
he
or
she
wanted
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
--
or
not
be
there.
the
point
is
made
that
in
the
board's
brief
that
there
is
industrial
practice
concerning
bargaining
about
food
prices.
this
simply
is
not
so,
the
board
alludes
to
a
case.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
despite
searches
on
both
sides
in
those
case
we've
been
able
to
come
up
with
no
contracts
which
so
provide.
i
have
never
seen
one
in
my
experience.
this
is
again
not
embracing
the
term
trivial
but
it's
a
matter
outside
the
mainstream
of
the
workplace,
the
workstation.
and
the
price
of
food
is
to
be
bargainal
--
bargainable
then
why
not
the
price
of
gasoline
or
a
discount
toward
price
of
gasoline
in
order
to
get
to
the
workplace
or
bargaining
about
work
clothes
which
certainly
are
essential.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
uniforms?
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
this
then
might
well
become
a
matter
of
wages
but
it
does
not
mean
that
it's
a
compulsory
subject
to
bargaining
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
your
honor.
the
act
does
not
contemplate
as
mr.
justice
stewart
noted
in
fibreboard
that
there
must
be
bargaining
about
anything
that
either
side
he
likes
to
bargain
about.
that
wasn't
the
intent
of
the
congress
at
all.
the
effect
of
section
8
(d)
is
to
in
effect,
the
line,
the
power
of
the
federal
government
under
this
statute
on
the
side
of
the
bargaining
agent
who
has
the
right
to
bargain
on
a
mandatory
subject.
in
other
words,
economic
strikers
have
rights
under
the
law.
and
again,
as
i
noted
this
simply
was
not
contemplated
by
the
congress.
moreover,
over
the
many
years
this
has
not
been
industrial
practice.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
and
they
would
have
a
right
to
bargain.
they
would
have
the
right
to
bargain
your
honor.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
an
unlikely
possibility
your
honor.
this
is
a
problem,
the
fragmentizing,
the
injection
of
a
very
complex
area
really
loading
the
gun
on
one
side
and
not
on
the
other.
the
seventh
circuit
without
record
support
stated
that
brown
bagging
was
not
a
viable
alternative.
but
here
again,
the
record
simply
does
not
support
that
conclusion
as
evidenced
by
the
boycott
when
over
50%
of
the
union
members
did
it.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
from
early
february
until
june.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
well
your
honor,
our
chicago
summers
aren't
much
different
from
winters
currently.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
well,
may
i
address
this
point,
there
is
provision
in
the
locker
room
area,
ventilated
area
for
the
storing
of
lunches.
lunches
may
not
be
eaten
there
but
they
may
be
eaten
and
are
eaten
in
the
cafeteria
areas
which
are
air
conditioned.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
storage
area
is
not.
this
is
the
locker
area.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
well
your
honors,
we
address
this
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
think
it's
a
significant
point
under
modern
practices
there
is
a
laundry
list
of
food,
this
is
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
of
food,
no
refrigeration
needed.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
indeed,
the
venerable
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
and
many
did
not
during
the
boycott
and
it
is
probably
better
for
them
on
occasion
not
to.
in
the
fannie
farmer
cookbook,
this
statement
is
made,
for
lunch
boxes
and
picnics,
frozen
sandwiches
thaw
completely
in
about
4
hours
and
tape
pressure
even
though
many
days
or
weeks
before
than
sandwiches
made
the
same
day
which
have
not
been
refrigerated.
similarly
in
women's
day
from
september
27,
1978
appears
this
statement,
packing
lunch
can
be
a
real
inflation
fighter
and
lots
of
fun
too.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
well,
your
honor
i
must
confess
you
spread
it
out
that
way
i
have
no
real
response.
we
have
not
dealt
with
the
subject
of
food
services.
indeed,
neither
the
board
nor
the
court
dealt
with
food
services
and
what
is
encompassed
by
that
term.
does
it
mean
margarine
versus
butter?
does
it
mean
special
facilities
without
delivering
the
point
that
the
problem
area
here
is
identical
with
the
problem
area
on
food
prices.
it
opens
a
pandora's
box
of
problems,
far
transcending
the
lunch
box
as
such.
as
a
second
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
at
no
cost.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
most
of
the
equipment.
basically,
the
contractor
provides
food,
health
--
runs
the
operation.
gets
a
total
9%
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
that's
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
all
belongs
to
ford,
yes.
well,
finally
with
respect
to
services
as
i
have
perhaps
noted
in
addition
to
the
problem
that
is
inherent
in
the
price
problem
there
is
the
additional
problem
of
vagueness
of
the
board's
and
the
court's
order,
what
are
services
if
--
for
it
doesn't
comply,
should
there
be
an
order
that
this
is
a
mandatory
subject
to
bargaining?
it's
subject
to
contempt
for
violation
of
an
order
directing
bargaining
about
“food
services”.
thank
you.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
question
here
is
posited
on
the
board's
finding
that
this
case
is
within
the
factual
and
the
legal
context
of
the
earlier
decisions.
in
other
words,
the
factual
finding
was
that
indeed
it
was
not
different
despite
what
the
seventh
circuit
said
about
it.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
that
is
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
because
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
the
thesis
that
have
come
up
earlier
are
no
different
than
this
case.
now
that
excludes
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
--
the
situation
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
--
to
which
the
chief
justice
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
seventh
circuit
arrived
at
its
decision
and
then
wrote
an
opinion
to
have
followed
the
result.
for
instance,
the
factors
to
which
it
alluded,
influence
over
prices,
court
of
appeals
said
that
ford
retains
influence
over
cafeteria
and
vending
machine
prices.
but
this
was
a
situation
in
mccall's
in
the
fourth
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
says
the
possibility
of
profit.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
well
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
think
they're
defending
it
on
the
very
broad
base.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no,
your
honor,
they
do
not.
and
finally
i
should
note
further
that
the
amici
go
beyond
the
seventh
circuit
and
take
the
position
despite
the
fibreboard
concurrence
of
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
should
be
bargaining
about
all
matters
beyond
prices,
beyond
food
services.
as
i
understand
their
position,
any
matter
which
either
party
desires
to
bargain
about.
thank
you.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
very
briefly
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
members
of
the
court.
i
think
the
bottom
line
on
the
position
which
learned
counsel
for
the
uaw
artic
--
has
articulated
here.
what
he
is
talking
about
and
what
they're
asking
for
is
a
recipe
for
industrial
unrest.
in
essence,
bargaining
on
cost
of
living
which
embraces
as
i
noted
earlier
food
prices
as
well
as
other
matters
it
seems
to
me
as
history
has
demonstrated
in
the
collective
bargaining
arena,
very
satisfactorily
solves
the
problem.
to
now
expand
the
concept
to
include
prices,
services,
would
be
doing
a
disservice.
i
suggest
to
the
intent
of
the
congress,
to
the
working
and
the
living
relationship
amongst
the
parties.
thank
you
very
much.
