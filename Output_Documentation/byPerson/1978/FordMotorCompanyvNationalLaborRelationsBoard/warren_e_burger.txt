we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
ford

company
against
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
kammholz,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
subsidy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
specially
if
the
union
demanded
in
a
subsidy
that
would
be
in
effect
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
addition
of
compensation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
take
the
view
that
permitting
or
not
permitting
food
dispensing
establishments
was
subject
to
collective
bargaining
mandatory?
chief

lumberjacks
up
in
the
mountains.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
really
thought
to
the
weyerhaeuser
case,
if
the
lumberjacks
didn't
eat
the
very
hearty
food
which
lumber
companies
normally
provide
for
them,
the
productivity
would
probably
go
down.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
was
pursuing
mr.
justice
stevens'
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
suggestion
in
some
circumstances
a
you've
--
as
you
are
aware
with
the
weyerhaeuser
case.
the
--
there
being
no
other
place
to
eat
up
in
the
mountains,
on
the
mountainside
cutting
trees
down.
the
company
provides
the
food
and
they
want
to
provide
food
that
will
produce
a
lot
of
energy
that
in
turn
will
produce
a
lot
of
logs.
isn't
that
the
theory
behind
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
they
lowered
the
price?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
how
long?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
company
--
was
ford
supply
the
space
to
the
franchised
restaurant
operator
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
at
no
cost?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anything
else
beside
the
space?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
kammholz.
mr.
come.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
board's
or
the
court
of
appeals,
i'm
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
--
that's
an
indirect
subsidy
in
itself,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
--
if
your
position
is
correct,
the
board's
position
is
correct,
the
union
then
could
make
a
demand
not
only
for
all
the
subsidy
indirectly
involved
in
providing
the
space
and
the
--
all
the
equipment
but
in
addition
50%
of
the
cost.
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
require
that
to
be
bargained.
and
if
they
could
require
to
the
bargained
they
could
go
on
straight
to
first,
the
employer,
to
pay
half
of
the
cost
of
the
food,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
doubt
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
don't
you
think
we
have
an
obligation
when
this
kind
of
an
issue
is
presented
to
see
where
the
proposals
on
one
side
of
the
other
will
carry
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
we
haven't
--
at
least
i
didn't
hear
you
yet
answer
my
question.
the
union
demands
not
only
the
provision
for
the
space
and
the
refrigerators
and
the
stoves
and
the
implements
and
the
chairs
and
the
tables
also
in
addition
to
that
50%
of
the
cost
of
the
food
so
that
the
employees
can
have
lunch
for
half
prices
at
work.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
can
bar
--
if
they
must
bargain
the
price
of
the
lunch
it
can
--
is
there
any
escape
from
bargaining
the
--
exactly
what
i've
hypothesized
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
assume
that
so,
is
this
price
part
of
availability
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
did
they
manage
during
the
boycott?
they
carry
their
food
probably?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
they
went
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
they
went
out,
isn't
that
what
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
a
little
over
your
time
now
mr.
come.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fillion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
come
that
although
he
was
not
willing
to
respond
that
50%
subsidy
for
the
food
was
bargainable,
he
quickly
ceased
on
the
idea
that
free
food
would
be
bargainable.
do
you
think
free
food?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it
if
the
employer
pays
all
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
no
bargaining
problem.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
use.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it
was
focused
just
on
lettuce,
would
that
be
a
secondary
boycott?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
fillion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
