mr.
drew
s.days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
respond
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
put
to
my
colleague.essentially,
does
a
school
board
get
out
from
under
the
responsibility
for
certain
segregatory
practices?
and
i
think
that
keyes'
response
to
that
question,
talking
about
essentially
the
attenuation
theory.
and
there
is
indeed
a
possibility
for
a
school
board
to
show
that
past
segregative
acts
have
not
created
or
contributed
to
current
segregated
conditions
and
i
think
that's
a
burden
that
is
open
to
every
school
board
to
try
to
discharge.
mr.
drew
s.days,
iii
i
don't
believe
it's
impossible.
it
has
to
be
evaluated
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
but
i
think
it's
open
to
a
school
board
to
make
that
showing.
that's
what
this
court
said
and
i
think
it
also
said
it
in
swann
that
there
was
a
possibility
available
to
a
board
to
make
this
type
of
showing.
there's
one
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
and
that
is
to
make
clear
that
there
is
no
suggestion
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
dayton
be
overruled.
we
think
that
dayton
i
can
be
read
consistently
with
the
earlier
decisions
of
this
court.
even
where
there
is
a
showing
of
a
system-wide
violation,
the
inquiry
nevertheless
must
be
made
as
to
what
are
the
cumulative
or
the
incremental
--
strike
cumulative,
incremental
segregative
effects
of
that
violation.
but
the
columbus
and
dayton
school
boards
challenged
here
the
validity
of
principles
and
procedures
that
are
not
the
product
of
some
theoretical
exercise.
they
come
instead
from
our
judicial
experience
in
hundreds
of
cases
with
--
to
quote
this
court's
opinion
in
swann,
“the
flinty
intractable
realities
of
how
to
make
desegregation
work
in
the
face
of
deliberate
resistance
and
changes
since
1954
in
the
structure
and
patterns
of
communities,
the
growth
of
student
population,
movement
of
families,
and
other
changes.”
mr.
drew
s.days,
iii
i
do
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
i
read
that
language
in
context,
in
the
context
of
showing
not
just
one
such
act
creating
a
segregative
effect
but
a
pattern
of
that
conduct
in
the
context
of
other
showings
of
segregative
intent.
in
other
words,
it
is
some
evidence
--
this
pattern
is
some
evidence
that
there's
a
constitutional
violation
but
it's
necessary
as
arlington
heights
points
out
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
to
look
at
the
history,
to
look
at
contemporaneous
practices,
to
look
at
alternatives
that
were
available
to
the
board.
mr.
drew
s.days,
iii
well,
i
would
--
i'm
not
here
to
defend
the
sixth
circuit,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
the
principle
is
one
of
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and,
where
there
is
a
pattern
--
consistent
pattern
of
decisions
that
will
produce
segregation
as
opposed
to
avoiding
segregation
and
achieving
integration.
that
pattern,
absent
some
showing
by
the
school
board
that
there
are
justified
explanations
for
it
becomes
sufficient
basis
for
a
determination
of
a
violation.
this
is
not
unusual.
this
court
said
in
washington
versus
davis
that
certain
patterns
if
they're
shown
to
be
very
consistent
can
ultimately
serve
as
the
basis
for
determination
of
a
violation
not
simply
an
inference
of
that
violation.
the
principles
that
have
been
articulated
by
this
court
in
its
opinions
are
grounded
on
considerations
of
fairness
and
policy
and
designed
to
provide
practical
and
effective
means
of
eliminating
longstanding
and
pervasive
segregation
of
the
public
schools
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
know
moreover
that
these
principles
have
worked
well
in
practice.
based
upon
a
review
of
the
reported
decisions
and
department
of
justice
files
we
have
determined
that
approximately
200
school
districts
with
a
combined
enrolment
of
more
than
5
million
students
are
presently
operating
under
court
ordered
desegregation
plans
that
are
premised
in
whole
or
in
part
on
the
remedial
principles
of
swann
and
keyes.
in
addition,
the
department
--
mr.
drew
s.days,
iii
thank
you.
with
respect
to
school
desegregation,
not
only
are
they
practical
and
effective
in
theory,
they
are
in
fact
practical
and
working
in
actuality.
we've
looked
at
reported
decisions
and
the
files
of
the
justice
department
and
as
i
indicated
we
found
that
there
are
200
school
districts
involving
over
5
million
children
who
are
going
to
desegregated
schools
based
in
whole
or
part
on
the
remedial
principles
of
swann
and
keyes.
in
addition
we've
consulted
with
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
and
have
learned
from
that
department
that
it
has
200
additional
school
districts
that
are
desegregated
as
a
result
of
the
guidance
provided
by
swann
and
keyes.
in
fact
one
reason
why
the
dayton
board
of
education
may
not
be
contesting
the
remedy
in
the
case
is
because
the
plan
there
is
working
well.
it's
in
its
third
year.
not
of
course,
meaning
to
say
that
the
board
gives
up
its
right
to
make
the
arguments
before
this
court
as
to
whether
the
correct
principles
were
applied.
but
what
the
records
here
reflect
is
a
familiar
pattern
of
intentional
segregative
acts
by
school
officials
affecting
substantial
portions
of
those
school
districts
by
techniques
such
as
segregated
faculty
assignments,
constructions,
additions,
sightings,
and
closings
of
schools
with
segregative
consequences
where
they
were
integrative
alternatives
available,
departures
--
mr.
drew
s.days,
iii
well,
in
columbus,
not
until
1974.
mr.
drew
s.days,
iii
and
in
dayton,
in
the
1971-1972
school
year.
mr.
drew
s.days,
iii
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
drew
s.days,
iii
well,
it's
been
eight
or
nine
years
since
that
was
decided.
so,
one
would
assume
that
there
are
students
who
started
in
elementary
school
who
are
still
in
the
system.
mr.
drew
s.days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.days,
iii
but
we've
seen
also
in
these
records
departures
from
so-called
neighborhood
concepts
when
it
served
to
keep
blacks
in
majority
black
schools
or
would
allow
whites
to
avoid
going
to
schools
that
were
substantially
black.
we
see
in
these
records
overnight
conversions
of
schools
from
white
to
black.
that
is,
one
day
the
faculty
was
white
and
the
student
body
was
partially
black.
the
next
day,
speaking
figuratively,
the
faculty
was
all-black
because
there
was
some
indication
that
that
school
had
a
substantial
black
student
body.
we
think
that
these
records
make
unavoidable
the
conclusion
that
the
principles
enunciated
in
brown,
green,
swann,
and
keyes
are
as
applicable
to
columbus
and
dayton
today
as
they
were
to
topeka,
kansas
in
1954,
new
kent
county,
virginia
in
1968,
charlotte,
north
carolina
in
1971,
and
denver,
colorado
in
1973.

mr.

yes.
mr.
drew

that's
correct.
mr.

well,

think

were.

mr.
drew
s.days,
iii
no,
i
believe
it
was
a
requirement
long
before
montgomery.
montgomery
was
really
concerned
with
what
type
of
remedy
one
could
enter
with
respect
to
faculty
segregation
but
i
think
it
was
clear
far
before
that
that
school
boards
had
the
responsibility
not
to
assign
faculty
members
based
upon
their
race.
thank
you
very
much.
