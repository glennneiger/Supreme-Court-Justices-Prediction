mr.
william
e.
caldwell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
case
as
a
parent
is
quite
different
from
the
case
that
has
been
presented
by
the
petitioners.
their
case
is
that
racial
discrimination
has
been
the
rare
exception
in
the
operation
of
the
dayton
public
schools.
my
case
is
that
it
has
been
the
rule.
their
case
in
effect
contends
that
deliberate
segregation
has
affected
the
schools
on
only
a
few
occasions
at
random
and
with
very
limited
and
precisely
definable
impact.
but
our
case
and
the
undeniable
facts
show
that
school
segregation
in
dayton
not
only
was
predictable,
it
was
predicted
by
purposeful
design
and
operation
for
a
period
of
at
least
60
years
from
1952
to
1972
--
i'm
sorry,
1912-1972,
the
board
operated
a
systematic
program
of
racial
segregation
that
was
circumscribed
by
neither
geography
nor
administrative
function.
throughout
this
time,
the
board
operated
a
covert
dual
school
system.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
the
district
court
found
no
extant
condition
requiring
a
constitutional
remedy.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
it
found
no
--
no,
well,
it
found
violations.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
well,
i'm
not
exactly
sure.
i
assume
that's
correct
since
it
dismissed
the
complaint
but
it
seemed
to
acknowledge
that
there
were
constitutional
violations
that
had
existed
in
the
past.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
but
none
had
any
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
--
continuing
effect
at
the
time
of
the
lawsuit.
that's
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
that
--
i
think
that's
at
least
implicit,
if
not
explicit,
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
the
facts
however
are
that
between
1912
and
the
time
of
brown
and
by
talking
about
the
pre-brown
period
i
don't
want
to
exclude
the
post-brown
period
which
i'll
turn
to
momentarily.
this
program
of
systematic
segregation
consisted
of
the
conversion
of
three
elementary
schools
into
blacks
only
schools
and
by
that
i
mean
schools
to
which
only
black
people
were
assigned
and
to
which
only
black
teachers
were
assigned.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
between
1912
and
1954
and
during
that
period
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
i'm
sorry?
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
the
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
these
schools
were
converted
as
a
need
arose
to
segregate
and
confine
the
black
population
as
the
black
population
grew.
so
it
began
in
1912
with
a
segregative
class
at
the
backdoor
of
an
otherwise
white
school.
that
moved
eventually
into
a
larger
out
building
in
the
back
of
this
white
school.
the
back
--
black
population
continued
to
grow.
the
school
was
converted
into
an
all-black
school
over
the
summer.
the
whites,
students
and
teachers,
were
transferred
out
to
other
schools.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
and
this
process
was
repeated.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
that's
correct,
and
these
schools
were
full-blown
state
imposed
segregative
schools
at
the
time
of
brown.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
i
cannot
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
the
state
of
ohio
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
the
state
of
ohio
acting
through
its
agency
with
jurisdiction
over
this
problem
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
imposed
--
not
acting
through
its
legislature,
but
if
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
that's
correct.
they
also
con
--
they
also
--
prior
to
brown
built
another
all-black
school
which
made
four
all-black
elementary
schools.
in
1933
they
constructed
paul
laurence
dunbar
high
school,
opened
it
as
a
blacks-only
high
school
operated
on
a
citywide
basis
from
--
to
which
blacks
from
all
over
the
system
were
assigned.
it
was
assigned
an
all-black
faculty.
this
school
continued
in
raw
form
as
it
was
created
in
1933
until
1962.
the
board
from
1912
to
1951
operated
pursuant
to
a
system-wide
policy
of
never
allowing
black
teachers
to
have
any
contact
with
white
pupils.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
your
honor,
i
--
it
will
be
until
they've
done
something
to
undo
this
horrendous
wrong
that
they've
committed.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
convince
you
is
that
by
the
time
of
brown
the
dayton
school
authorities
had
essentially
accomplished
the
same
result
that
north
carolina
accomplished
in
charlotte
and
mecklenburg
and
that
thereafter
they
should've
been
under
the
same
constitutional
duty.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
i
should've
said
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
was
that
they
had
committed
that
same
wrong
and
therefore
under
the
same
constitutional
duty.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
the
--
i
was
curious
about
that
question
in
the
columbus
case.
in
our
case
--
any
time
the
court
of
appeals
finds
a
finding
of
fact
of
a
district
court
clearly
erroneous,
it
is
necessarily
asserting
another
fact
and
it
is
finding
another
fact.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
i
--
in
--
as
i
read
the
clearly
erroneous
decisions,
they
almost
always
--
the
appellate
court
arrives
at
a
judgment
unless
there's
some
other
issue
aside
from
the
clearly
erroneous
findings
of
fact
at
issue.
but
if
an
appellate
court
decides
a
double
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
oh,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
leading
clearly
erroneous
case,
united
states
versus
jefferson
company,
is
a
case
in
which
the
facts
were
enormously
complex
and
the
court
dealt
with
those
at
some
length.
i
may
be
mistaken
about
my
recollection
of
the
facts
in
that
case
but
quite
a
few
of
the
cases
involved
--
in
this
court
have
involved
antitrust
litigation
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
not
the
more
recent
u.s.
versus
jefferson.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
the
1948
decision.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
that's
correct.
they
have
the
option
of
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
--
bearing
that
burden.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
ordinarily
that
would
be
the
case
in
the
situation
where
a
school
board
was
making
the
assertion
that
it
wanted
to
meet
its
burden
of
showing
that
the
system-wide
violation
had
less
impact
than
intended.
but
in
this
instance
the
board
of
education
has
not
contended
ever
that
if
we
are
right
about
the
nature
of
the
violation
that
there's
anything
wrong
with
this
remedy
that
we
have
and
so
it
is
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
that
is
his
contention
your
honor.
but
he
has
not
--
has
not
made
the
next
argument
by
conceding
that
if
he's
wrong
about
that
he
nevertheless
thinks
that
the
remedy
is
too
broad.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
well,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
each
case
perhaps
whether
you
have
a
separate
inquiry.
ordinarily,
you
have
a
separate
--
in
school
segregation
litigation
where
the
question
of
violation
as
an
issue,
you
have
a
bifurcated
approach,
one
dealing
with
a
violation
and
one
dealing
with
a
remedy.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
not
in
this
case
your
honor
because
in
the
court
of
appeals
we
challenged
the
board
to
point
out
any
part
of
the
remedy
which
it
thought
was
excessive
if
we
were
right
about
the
violation.
the
--
there's
nothing
that
has
prohibited
the
board
from
assuming
arguendo
that
there
has
been
a
system-wide
violation
and
saying
nevertheless
we
think
the
remedy
goes
too
far
even
as
they
contend
the
violation.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
not
if
the
school
board
is
not
making
the
contention
and
if
the
school
board
were
to
make
that
contention
or
had
made
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
would
agree
that
the
ordinary
course
would
be
to
send
it
back
for
a
hearing
on
that
issue.
but
they
have
not
to
this
day
to
my
knowledge
mr.
justice,
made
a
contention
about
the
need
to
have
a
remedy
hearing
on
this
particular
issue.
our
assertion
is
and
we've
asserted
in
our
brief
and
i
do
not
understand
them
to
disagree
is
that
if
we're
right
about
the
violation
and
its
impact,
they're
satisfied
with
the
remedy.
by
1954,
i
should
mention
a
couple
of
other
important
policies
which
were
followed
throughout
the
system,
the
--
by
1954,
54%
of
all
black
students
and
all
black
teachers
were
confined
to
these
deliberately
created
blacks-only
schools.
throughout
this
same
period
of
time
between
1912
and
1954,
whenever
black
students
attended
school
in
predominantly
white
schools,
they
were
subjected
to
all
forms
of
within
school
discrimination,
segregated
swimming
pool,
segregated
locker
rooms.
the
athletic
programs
were
separate
--
segregated
until
1948.
black
children
were
required
to
sit
in
the
back
of
the
class,
denied
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
white
activities
such
as
being
an
angel
in
the
school
play.
and
black
orphanage
children
from
across
town
were
bused
into
these
blacks-only
schools
pass
nearby
white
schools
to
which
they
could've
attended.
and
the
board
operated
one-race
classrooms
in
explicitly
designated
one-race
public
housing
projects.
but
i
--
as
i
say,
54%
of
the
black
children
at
the
time
of
brown
were
in
these
blacks-only
schools
and
three-fourths
of
all
children
were
in
schools
that
were
virtually
one-race.
except
for
the
absence
of
the
written
state
law
permitting
this
result,
the
dayton
system
was
a
--
was
basically
the
same
system
or
the
same
as
the
systems
that
were
before
the
court
in
brown
and
it
was
basically
the
same
system
that
existed
in
charlotte.
the
major
or
the
minor
slight
factual
distinction
is
that
there
was
a
minimal
level
of
tolerance
of
racial
mixing.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
it
--
would
what
be
true
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
well,
i
--
in
my
case,
i'm
talking
about
de
jure
concentration.
i'm
not
talking
about
de
facto
concentration
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
pattern
exists.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
oh,
it's
certainly
possible.
i
--
the
question
is
how
did
it
get
that
way
and
i
don't
know
that
there's
been
a
litigation
on
that
issue
in
new
york
city.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
although
there
had
been
some
school
boards
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
well,
if
it
is
your
honor,
it's
a
sad
state
of
affairs
because
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
because
these
people
did
the
same
thing
that
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
board
of
education
did.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
and
this
should
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
i'd
--
what
was
the
first
part
of
your
question,
i
didn't
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
at
--
this
system
that
was
--
that
existed
at
the
time
of
brown
was
expanded
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
--
expanded
and
maintained
throughout
that
period.
the
board
never
met
its
affirmative
duty
to
undo
that
deliberate
segregation.
instead
it
deliberately
advantaged
itself
of
the
very
substantial
root
system
and
trunk
of
segregation
that
were
firmly
emplaced
in
1954
so
that
as
of
the
time
of
trial,
the
schools
in
the
dayton
system
were
racially
segregative
because
of
system-wide
policies
and
practices
of
deliberate
racial
segregation.
these
policies
and
practices
included
the
continued
racial
assignment
of
faculty
to
existing
schools
and
as
well
as
to
new
classroom
space,
according
to
the
racial
composition
of
the
students
pursuant
to
a
policy
adopted
in
1951
which
was
explicitly
racist.
it
said
that
we
will
introduce
negro
teachers
into
white
schools
when
white
--
the
white
communities
are
willing
to
accept
them
and
we
will
introduce
--
we
will
not
introduce
white
teachers
into
negro
schools
against
their
will.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
this
policy
was
in
effect
from
1951
until
1969
when
hew
intervened
pursuant
to
title
vi
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
but
it
--
but
its
vestiges
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
--
were
rampant.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
the
board
engaged
in
a
massive
pattern
of
school
construction
on
a
racially
segregative
basis
and
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
two
things
during
the
period
between
1954
and
the
time
of
trial
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
if
it
does
that
in
a
vacuum
your
honor,
it's
one
thing.
but
in
this
case
they
did
it
in
a
context
of
a
system-wide
program
of
segregation
which
had
funneled
black
people
to
part
of
a
system
and
preserved
the
rest
of
the
system
for
whites.
and
that
--
they
cannot
be
forgiven
for
that
any
more
than
charlotte-mecklenburg
can
be
forgiven
for
that
for
the
period
between
1954
--
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
no,
the
court
of
appeals
made
that
finding
with
respect
to
a
number
of
the
board's
practices
and
they
found
that
the
entire
--
that
the
board
was
operating
a
system-wide
program
of
segregation.
mr.
william
e.
caldwell
well,
i'll
give
you
one
example
of
such
a
finding.
the
dunbar
high
school
which
operated
from
1933
to
1962,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
through
discriminatory
practices
in
other
parts
of
the
system
the
board,
by
counseling,
by
discriminating
against
black
students
if
they
went
to
predominantly
white
schools,
in
effect,
forced
blacks
to
go
to
this
system-wide
blacks-only
high
school.
any
person
who
would
--
who
was
--
observed
that
situation
would
make
a
residential
choice
on
the
basis
of
the
board's
policy
or
would
likely
make
a
residential
choice
on
the
basis
of
the
board's
segregation
policy.
a
white
family
seeking
a
residence
in
dayton
certainly
would
not
move
to
the
dunbar
high
school
area
where
their
children
couldn't
even
be
educated
because
they
couldn't
have
any
contact
with
black
teachers.
at
the
same
time,
black
families
were
not
inclined
to
move
or
could
not
have
been
inclined
to
move
into
the
white
parts
of
town
where
they
would've
been
subjected
to
humiliating
discrimination
and
never
had
contact
with
black
adults.
i
want
to
make
one
other
point.
by
1969,
considerable
pressures
were
being
brought
to
bear
on
the
operation
of
the
--
on
the
segregated
operation
of
the
dayton
public
schools
and
on
the
school
authorities
to
do
something
about
that
condition.
hew
as
i
said,
intervened
in
1969
and
found
that
the
board
had
a
racially
motivated
faculty
assignment
policy
and
worked
out
a
two-year
remedy
for
that.
the
state
board
of
ohio
investigated
the
school
system
at
that
to
the
state
board
of
education
and
found
that
the
board
was
under
a
moral
and
constitutional
duty
to
take
remedial
action.
the
board
appointed
a
citizen's
committee
which
made
similar
findings.
the
board
president
admitted
before
the
citizen's
committee
that
the
board
itself
had
been
guilty
of
past
de
jure
acts
of
segregation
--
intentional
acts
of
segregation,
i
should
say.
then
the
board
itself
considered
that
question
in
december
of
1971
and
adopted
revolution
--
resolutions
admitting
that
its
past
practices
had
caused
a
current
condition
of
segregation
and
directing
the
superintendent
to
develop
a
remedy.
all
of
these
findings
are
--
would
be
entitled
a
probative
weight
in
any
circumstance
given
the
normal
reluctance
of
school
officials
to
admit
past
wrongdoing.
in
this
case
they
are
compelling
because
the
facts
cannot
be
read
to
the
contrary.
that
remedial
action
of
course
was
rescinded
the
following
month
when
a
new
board
of
education
took
over.
we
think
--
if
i
may
sum
up
by
comparing
swann
to
this
case
that
the
--
and
in
swann,
the
court
had
--
the
court
recognized
that
the
delay
between
1954
and
1971,
it
compounded
the
problem,
that
dilatory
tactics
of
school
authorities
had
compounded
the
problem.
that
the
court's
failure
to
refine
guidelines
had
compounded
the
problem,
that
the
massive
urban
growth
that
had
occurred
through
this
period
compounded
the
problem.
yet
the
court
recognized
that
the
school
officials'
persistent
discriminatory
conduct
had
played
a
substantial
role
in
this
pattern
of
development
and
that
those
findings
are
fully
applicable
to
date
and
that
remedy
should
be
fully
applicable.
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
