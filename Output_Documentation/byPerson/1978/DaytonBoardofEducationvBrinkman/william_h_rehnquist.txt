justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
since
judge
rubin
found
there
was
no
violation
here
presumably
there
was
never
any
hearing
at
all
on
remedy
and
--
so,
shouldn't
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
very
least,
even
under
its
own
hypothesis,
have
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
so
that
the
school
board
could've
been
heard
on
the
issue
of
remedy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
--
i
understood
your
opponent
to
argue
at
some
length
that
the
violations
--
whatever
violations
existed
were
not
system-wide.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
regard
those
as
two
separate
stages
of
the
proceeding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
you
a
school
board
counsel
in
this
case
after
succeeding
in
getting
your
--
the
complaint
dismissed
in
the
district
court
on
the
violation
issue
have
been
somewhat
surprised
by
a
court
of
appeals
decision
which
not
only
said
there
was
a
violation
and
we
now
impose
this
remedy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
that
something
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
caldwell,
you
say
the
board
engaged
in
a
massive
program
of
school
seg
--
construction
on
a
segragative
basis,
supposing
the
board
has
to
build
a
school
out
in
a
newly
developed
area
which
the
population
of
which
is
99%
white
and
it
picks
a
site
out
there
and
it
knows
that
99%
of
people
going
to
school
are
white.
would
you
describe
that
as
part
of
that
kind
of
a
program?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
where
is
that
finding?
i
mean,
judge
rubin
obviously
did
not
so
find.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
did
it
--
where
is
the
finding
as
to
funneling
by
school
constructions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
speak
of
hundreds
of
cases.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
about
one
that
you
set
forth
at
some
length
in
your
brief
on
page
64
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on,
a
case
called
oliver
versus
michigan
state
board
of
education.
in
your
quote
at
that
page
of
your
brief
is
from
oliver,
it
says,
“the
presumption
of
segregative
purpose
arises
when
plaintiffs
established
the
natural
probable
and
foreseeable
result
of
the
public
official's
action
or
inaction
was
an
increase
or
perpetuation
of
public
school
segregation.
the
presumption
becomes
proof
unless
defendants
affirmatively
establish
their
action
or
inaction
was
a
consistent
and
result
application
of
racially
neutral
policies.”
do
you
think
that
is
consistent
with
dayton,
with
arlington
heights,
or
with
washington
against
davis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
oliver
says
--
it's
not
a
--
doesn't
just
say
it
permits
an
inference,
it
says
it's
a
presumption
that
becomes
proof
unless
it's
rebutted.
