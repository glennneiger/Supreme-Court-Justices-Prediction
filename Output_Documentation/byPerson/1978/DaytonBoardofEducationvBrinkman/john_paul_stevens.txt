extent
i
--
one
of
our
problems
in
the
case
as
you
know,
is
the
court
of
appeals
making
findings.
now
are
you
asking
us
to
make
findings
or
the
district
court
to
make
findings
covering
this
area
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
the
district
court
make
findings
on
the
--
on
this
very
point,
that
the
effect
would've
been
the
same
regardless
of
the
violation,
if
any?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
position
is
really,
regardless
of
which
party
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
this
issue,
you've
met
it
if
it
--
