mr.
greer,
i
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun

don't
think
you're
really
stating
the
theory
the
court
of
appeals,
are
you?
they
didn't
start
from
the
fact
there
was
presently
imbalance
and
infer
a
violation
in
that.
didn't
they
start
from
the
notion
that
there
was
proof
of
an
intentional
violation
pre
--
as
of
1954
and
a
failure
affirmatively
to
correct
the
situation?
they
relied
entirely
on
a
duty
to
take
affirmative
action
in
effect.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
right.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
correct.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
right.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
right.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
they
say
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
that
as
of
that
date
there
was
a
clear
duty
on
the
part
of
the
board
to
change
a
situation
they
found
to
exist.
now,
i
know
you
don't
accept
the
finding
as
of
that
time.
and
that
the
failure
to
have
corrected
in
the
interval
amounts
to
a
present
violation
today.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
there
would
be
such
a
duty,
would
there
not
if
they
are
right
about
the
dual
system
in
1954?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
let
me
just
test
that
because
this
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
goes
to
--
really,
the
heart
of
the
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
supposing
you
had
a
de
facto
situation
with
all-black
and
all-white
schools,
totally
the
same,
and
then
all
they
did
was
change
rules
saying
anybody
can
go
to
any
school
within
three-quarters
of
a
mile
of
his
home
or
whatever
the
boundary
was,
but
there
was
no
change
in
boundaries.
say,
you
didn't
--
you
would
have
to
change
the
boundaries
to
correct
the
situation,
and
you
say
it's
no
duty
to
change
boundaries?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
say,
they
were
gerrymandered
and
all
the
rest
of
it
just
to
make
sure
there
are
no
black
schools
and
white
schools
and
vice
versa.
could
they
leave
the
situation
exactly
as
it
was?
