mr.
david
c.
greer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i,
at
least,
was
pleased
by
having
the
respondents
in
the
columbus
case
open
by
asking
that
this
court
affirm
the
findings
of
the
trier
of
the
facts,
the
trial
court.
and
i
would
hope
that
they
would
open
their
argument
in
this
case
with
the
same
request.
let
me
open
my
argument
by
attempting
to
answer
in
the
context
of
dayton
a
legal
question
and
then
a
factual
question
that
had
been
posed
in
the
context
of
columbus.
at
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
filed
in
april
of
1972,
seven
years
ago,
there
were
3
--
57
elementary
schools
in
the
dayton
school
system,
including
the
middle
schools.
there
were
no
all-white
elementary
schools.
there
were
three
all-black.
there
were
11
high
schools
in
the
dayton
school
district.
none
of
them
were
all-white.
two
of
them
were
all-black.
as
far
as
teaching
staffs
were
concerned,
the
teachers
in
the
dayton
school
system
were
integrated
throughout
the
system
on
the
basis
of
the
same
ratio
between
black
and
white
teachers
in
each
school
as
there
was
in
the
system
as
a
whole.
to
turn
from
the
questions
posed
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall
to
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
stevens,
now
which
is
a
legal
question,
“was
the
remedy
in
swann
correct?”
let
me
answer
that
at
least
in
part
by
saying
that
i
would
stand
here
and
say
that
every
principle
enunciated
in
swann
was
correct.
whether
the
remedy
was
correct
depends
upon
what
the
facts
were
when
that
case
went
back
to
the
trial
court
and
how
those
facts
were
presented
to
the
court
and
what
the
findings
were.
i
think
i
stand
here
in
a
culmination
of
a
series
of
decisions.
there
has
been
some
implication
or
direct
indication
in
some
of
the
briefs
filed
that
we're
asking
the
court
to
overrule
swann
or
to
overrule
keyes
or
to
overrule
some
prior
decision.
we're
not.
we
are
here
in
a
case
of
equity
that
turns
on
particular
facts
and
i
think
that's
important.
and
i
think
the
principles
enunciated
in
dayton
i
grow
directly
from
swann
and
the
other
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
it
was
in
swann
that
this
court
said
that
the
remedial
task
is
to
correct
a
constitutional
violation,
the
condition
that
offends
the
constitution.
it
was
in
swann
that
there
was
reference
to
the
equitable
powers
of
this
court
being
remedial
powers,
corrective
powers,
and
that
the
nature
of
the
violation
is
what
determines
the
scope
of
a
remedy
in
a
school
desegregation
case
or
in
any
other
equitable
case.
in
milliken,
this
court
held
that
the
remedy
is
necessarily
designed,
as
all
remedies
are
to
restore
the
victims
of
discriminatory
conduct
to
the
position
they
would've
occupied
in
the
absence
of
such
conduct.
that,
it
seems
to
me
is
clearly
what
the
incremental
segregative
effect
standard
of
dayton
i
is.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
as
the
trial
court
found
in
this
case,
there
was
no
system-wide
violation.
i
would
also
submit
to
the
court,
however,
that
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
system-wide
violation
the
equitable
principles
applicable
to
cases
of
this
nature
require
a
finding
with
respect
to
incremental
segregative
effect
because
the
remedial
purpose
is
a
restorative
purpose.
it's
not
to
compare
what
is
to
what
ought
to
be
in
some
ideal
world
in
which
none
of
us
can
ever
live.
it's
an
effort
to
compare
what
is
to
what
would
have
been
in
the
absence
of
violations.
and
under
the
sharply
defined
standard
of
this
court
as
expressed
in
dayton
the
remedy
turns
on
a
comparison
between
what
is
and
what
would've
been.
in
justifying
a
system-wide
remedy
in
this
case,
the
sixth
circuit
completely
abandoned
that
comparative
test
and
it
redefined
the
whole
concept
of
incremental
segregative
effect
in
terms
of
a
snowballing
process
of
cumulative
violations.
mr.
david
c.
greer
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
greer
he
dismissed
the
case
flat..
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
greer
in
three
areas,
he
did.
pre-1951,
in
faculty
assignment,
there
was
a
policy
of
assigning
black
faculty
to
teach
in
black
schools.
there
was
in
1933,
established
a
school,
dunbar
high
school
which
had
a
system-wide
attendance
zone.
and
that
school
was
attended
by
black
students.
mr.
david
c.
greer
only.
that
school
went
out
of
existence
in
1962.
mr.
david
c.
greer
there
is
a
dunbar
high
school,
the
school
that
was
dunbar
from
1933
to
1952.
the
physical
plant
was
turned
into
an
elementary
school
named
mcfarland.
mr.
david
c.
greer
well,
the
fact
that
paul
laurence
dunbar
was
a
great
negro
poet
has
no
relationship
to
the
fact
that
dunbar
high
school,
the
new
dunbar
or
the
old
mcfarland,
are
attended
primarily
by
black
students
today.
that
fact
is
established
by
the
residential
complexion
of
the
neighborhood
that
those
schools
serve.
mr.
david
c.
greer
correct.
mr.
david
c.
greer
well,
it
depends
upon
the
context
of
which
you
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
building
the
schools
was
deliberate,
sure.
mr.
david
c.
greer
by
virtue
of
their
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
--
neighborhood
proximity.
mr.
david
c.
greer
yes
is
the
answer,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
greer
if
i
may
come
back
to
that
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
--
after
i
have
added
my
“yes,
but”
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
question.
i
think
the
complete
answer
to
that
is
that
while
that
is
all
entirely
true,
it
overlooks
the
fact
that
there
was
no
feasible
alternative
for
the
board
other
than
the
location
of
those
schools
as
they
were.
the
--
as
the
plaintiffs'
own
witnesses
have
testified,
the
only
alternative
to
the
program
that
you
have
just
described
was,
one,
build
a
single
campus
in
the
city
of
dayton
and
bring
all
students'
bus
to
that
or,
two,
to
adopt
some
system-wide
busing
plan
to
mix
the
races.
mr.
david
c.
greer
well,
whether
it's
new
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
well,
whether
it's
new
or
old
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
alright,
if
it's
not
new,
it
is
a
fact
in
this
case
that
because
of
the
residential
patterns
in
dayton,
those
were
the
only
available
alternatives.
to
get
back
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
third
finding
was
essentially
a
group
of
isolated
practices,
all
of
which,
the
court
had
found
--
were
long
gone
years
before
this
suit
was
filed
and
on
which
the
court
found
there
was
no
incremental
segregative
effect
of
those
practices
at
the
time
of
suit.
separate
use
of
swimming
pools
at
roosevelt
high
school
for
black
students
and
white
students
back
in
the
‘30s,
or
separate
athletic
competitions
for
dunbar
students
up
to
the
‘40s.
or
back
in
the
early
1920,
a
situation
that
garfield
elementary
school
where
the
black
students
were
taught
in
a
separate
classroom.
mr.
david
c.
greer
1972,
april.
mr.
david
c.
greer
absolutely
none
your
honor
and
he
specifically
found
that
there
was
continuing
effect
of
these
prior
practices
in
the
three
areas
which
i
have
described.
the
--
i
think
it's
--
to
get
back
to
the
--
what
has
happened
with
the
legal
doctrines
involved
in
the
remedy
side
of
this
case
between
dayton
i
and
what
i
guess
will
now
be
dayton
ii.
the
sixth
circuit,
it
seems
to
me,
has
clearly
completely
distorted
and
abandoned
the
concept
of
incremental
segregative
effect.
that's
in
essence
admitted
in
the
briefs
in
opposition
to
us.
the
national
education
association
brief
points
out
that
the
sixth
circuit
described
that
as
a
description
of
the
manner
in
which
segregation
occurs
in
a
northern
schools
system
rather
than
as
a
legal
standard
for
determining
of
how
much
school
segregation
must
be
remedied.
that
i
would
submit,
is
a
clear
departure.
in
their
144
paged
brief,
the
respondents
never
discussed
the
sixth
circuit's
handling
of
the
concept
of
incremental
segregative
effect.
they
attached
it
in
a
footnote
in
a
kind
of
a
confession
and
avoidance
manner
at
page
128
of
their
brief
where
they
indicate
that
our
approach
would
be
correct,
relevant
at
least
if
this
were
a
case
of
isolated
segregative
practices
which
i
submit
to
you
it
is
but
that
the
incremental
segregative
effect
concept
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
a
situation
of
a
system-wide
violation.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
double
standard
expressed
with
regard
to
incremental
segregative
effect
in
your
opinion
in
dayton
i
nor
do
i
think
a
double
standard
is
justified.
if
the
equitable
purpose
is
restoration
of
the
goal,
whether
it's
a
system-wide
violation
or
isolated
violation
is
the
same.
mr.
david
c.
greer
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
c.
greer
that's
quite
correct.
although
--
because
of
what
happened
to
me
in
the
sixth
circuit
this
case
is
both
a
violation
and
a
remedy
case.
mr.
david
c.
greer
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
greer
that
is
absolutely
correct.
and
if
i
may
turn
to
that
aspect
of
the
case
to
discuss
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
clear
that
the
doctrinal
problem
to
get
to
the
legal
issue
here
and
where
i
believe
the
sixth
circuit
has
gone
astray
from
the
moorings
provided
by
your
decision.
the
doctrinal
problem
at
the
violation
stage
of
this
case
lies
in
the
substitution
of
what
i
would
refer
to
as
a
bed
of
procrustean
presumptions
for
the
judicial
analysis
that's
contemplated
by
the
arlington
heights,
washington,
davis,
and
dayton
i
decisions
of
this
court.
if
the
--
if
i
can
turn
the
phrase
“loaded
game
board”
to
a
new
use,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
series
of
presumptions
that
has
been
invented
by
the
sixth
circuit
as
a
means
for
requiring
system-wide
racial
balance
is
indeed
that.
the
way
that
the
analysis
seems
to
work
is
that
whenever
there
is
a
condition
of
current
racial
imbalance
in
schools,
which
there
certainly
was
in
dayton
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed,
then
it's
fair
game
to
go
back
in
the
past
as
far
as
may
be
necessary
to
find
some
constitutional
violation.
and
then
to
juxtapose
the
current
condition
of
racial
imbalance
with
a
historical
situation
of
a
constitutional
violation
by
the
welding
material
or
glue
of
a
concept
of
an
affirmative
duty
to
defuse
the
races
throughout
the
system.
now
that
it
seems
to
me
is
a
far
cry
from
the
concept
of
the
goal
in
the
case
in
determining
violation
is
to
focus
on
the
conditions
that
existed
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed
and
then
you
can
look
to
historical
background
to
see
if
those
conditions
were
created
by
some
constitutional
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
school
board.
but
you
beg
the
question
and
you
get
into
circular
reasoning
if
you
say
that
there
is
an
affirmative
duty
to
defuse
races
throughout
a
school
system
and
therefore
if
that
constitutional
duty
had
been
followed,
why,
the
races
would've
been
defused
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed
and
if
they
aren't
defused,
there
must
be
a
constitutional
violation.
that
i
submit
to
you
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
has
done
on
the
violation
side
of
this
case
and
i
think
that's
error.
and
i
think
that's
departure
from
the
precedence
and
rulings
of
this
court
and
it's
also
a
situation
that
if
that
kind
of
reasoning
were
adopted
any
school
system
in
which
there
is
existing
racial
balance
must
be
subjected
to
a
judicial
remedy
that
provides
racial
balance.
mr.
david
c.
greer
racial
imbalance,
i'm
sorry.
wherever
racial
imbalance
is
found,
the
courts
must
provide
racial
balance.
it's
essentially
what
the
sixth
circuit
is
saying.
that's
not
simply
an
application
of
the
keyes
burden
shifting
principle.
that
principle
is
of
course
triggered
by
a
finding
of
a
current
condition
of
intentional
segregation
in
a
substantial
or
meaningful
portion
of
the
system.
this
is
triggered
simply
by
a
finding
of
racial
imbalance
and
wherever
racial
imbalance
is
found,
racial
balance
must
follow.
it's
not
a
real
presumption.
it's
an
outcome
determinative
approach
to
finding
violations.
because
of
the
time
constraints
on
oral
argument
i
want
to
focus
on
these
legal
issues
and
i
have
to
refer
you
to
my
brief
for
the
factual
analysis
that
i
think
fits
hand-and-glove
with
them.
mr.
david
c.
greer
but
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
they're
talking
about
1954.
mr.
david
c.
greer
when
they're
putting
the
focus
there
rather
than
the
1972
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
--
when
the
suit
was
filed.
mr.
david
c.
greer
it
is
our
contention
that
there
was
no
dual
system
in
1954
or
in
1972
or
in
any
of
the
years
in
between.
mr.
david
c.
greer
but
what
they're
doing
is
instead
of
focusing
on
the
existence
of
a
violation
at
the
time
suit
was
filed,
is
using
a
double
focus.
one
is
a
condition
of
racial
imbalance
at
the
time
of
suit.
and
the
other
is
a
finding
of
an
unconstitutional
act
at
some
time
in
the
past.
they
picked
the
year
1954
which
i
would
submit
has
the
logic
only
of
being
the
date
of
the
brown
versus
board
of
education
decision.
mr.
david
c.
greer
i
would
say
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
and
that's
where
you
get
what
i
call
the
glue
or
the
weld,
and
that
is
this
affirmative
duty
and
they
--
the
words
of
the
sixth
circuit
are
“an
affirmative
duty
to
defuse
black
and
white
students
throughout
the
system.”
mr.
david
c.
greer
i
don't
think
there
would,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
constitutional
duty,
as
it's
been
defined
in
this
court,
is
to
provide
a
unitary
system.
and
what
is
a
unitary
school
system?
as
this
court
has
defined
that
term,
it
is
a
--
in
the
alexander
case,
for
example,
a
unitary
system
is
one
within
which
no
person
is
to
be
effectively
excluded
from
any
school
because
of
race
or
color.
the
aclu
in
its
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
alright.
mr.
david
c.
greer
it
does,
indeed.
mr.
david
c.
greer
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
greer
i
think
they
could
your
honor,
under
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
--
my
understanding
of
the
constitution.
mr.
david
c.
greer
absolutely
did,
and
i
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
but
the
duty
is
to
provide
a
system
in
which
no
one
is
denied
access
to
a
school
because
of
race
or
color
that
--
and
that
i
would
submit
to
you
is
different
from
an
affirmative
duty
to
create
some
balance
of
races
throughout
the
school
system.
mr.
david
c.
greer
the
phrase
--
good
old
phrase
“root
and
branch”
is
still
in
the
law,
but
in
the
green
case
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
in
the
green
case,
the
words
“root
and
branch”
refer
to
the
noun
“discrimination.”
it's
discrimination
that
is
to
be
taken
out
of
these
schools'
root
and
branch.
mr.
david
c.
greer
no,
i
have
not
admitted
that.
mr.
david
c.
greer
i
do
not
call
that
discrimination,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
greer
that
fact
i
admit,
yes.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
an
equity
case
and
maybe
i
can
highlight
this
best
but
--
addressing
you
--
your
attention
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
aclu
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
where
they
urged
the
court
to
--
in
essence,
overrule
dayton
i
and
hold
that
there
is
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
provides
an
affirmative
duty
to
create
as
much
dispersion
of
the
races
as
possible.
i
don't
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
you
have
defined
it
means
that.
and
in
order
to
get
where
the
respondents
want
to
get
in
the
case
they
have
to
have
you
rewrite
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
david
c.
greer
indeed
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
greer
well,
i
think
that
to
be
blunt
about
it,
if
the
respondents
want
to
get
where
they
want
to
end
up
in
this
case,
they've
got
to
adopt
the
reasoning
of
the
aclu
because
the
only
way
you
can
get
there
is
to
rewrite
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
that
manner.
and
to
hold
specifically
that
the
imposition
of
a
neighborhood
school
system
on
a
situation
where
you
have
racially
imbalanced
population
without
any
segregative
intent
or
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
board
at
all
violates
the
constitution.
and
i
don't
think
you
should
reach
that
conclusion
because
i
think
that's
an
incorrect
constitutional
conclusion.
mr.
david
c.
greer
both
of
my
opponents
have
suggested
that
the
dayton
school
board
is
not
contesting
a
remedy
in
this
case
and
i
think
it
behooves
me
to
correct
that
statement
before
you.
as
we've
indicated
in
the
opening
argument,
dayton
is
both
a
violation
and
a
remedy
case.
query
is
the
plan
that
has
been
imposed
in
dayton
working
well
with
a
student
population
that
has
shrunk
from
52,000
to
36,000
since
this
suit
was
filed.
mr.
david
c.
greer
i
will
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
indeed
i
do,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
i
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
it
is
your
honor
and
at
pages
45-50
of
our
brief,
i
have
expressed
the
factual
side
of
the
case
that
relates
to
that
remedy
finding.
either
i
have
expressed
it
so
well
that
nobody
has
deemed
it
possible
to
answer
it
or
i
have
expressed
it
so
poorly
that
nobody
has
deemed
it
necessary
to
answer
it.
but
i
would
like
to
think
that
the
former
is
true.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
remedial
goal
is
the
restoration
of
plaintiffs
to
substantiate
the
position
they
would've
occupied
in
the
absence
of
alleged
violations,
it
is
appropriate
to
examine
how
that
position
is
defined
by
the
evidence.
and
it
is
very
sharply
defined
by
the
evidence
in
this
case.
and
i
go
through
that
evidence
in
quite
a
bit
of
detail
in
pages
45-50
of
the
brief
and
it's
essentially
taking
black
census
data
and
taking
maps.
i
am
going
year
by
year
through
it
and
here's
what
you
find.
there
is
factual
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
center
of
the
black
population
in
dayton
was
established
not
by
the
school
board
but
by
the
1913
dayton
flood.
that
the
blacks'
population
following
that
flood
located
in
an
area
on
the
west
side
of
dayton
and
that
the
population
expanded
from
that
central
location
with
the
passage
of
time.
indeed,
in
the
periods
from
1951-1952
up
to
the
time
of
this
suit,
the
black
student
population,
the
dayton
school
system
increased
from
19%
to
almost
45%
of
the
students
in
the
school
system.
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
that
the
attendance
boundaries
in
the
dayton
school
system
have
been
unchanged
for
some
25
years.
there
hasn't
been
any
manipulation,
any
gerrymandering,
any
changes
of
any
of
these
school
boundaries.
and
the
evidence
demonstrates
graphically
through
maps
and
through
census
data
that
as
the
black
population
expanded
from
the
center
that
it
established
after
the
1913
flood,
the
schools
in
the
dayton
system
changed
from
white
to
racially-mixed
to
black,
reflecting
the
residential
population
change.
and
it
can
be
demonstrated
year
by
year
in
a
ring
of
schools
that
follows
that
census
population
that
there
was
no
change
brought
in
these
attendance
boundaries
or
any
other
manner
by
the
board
to
contain
or
to
change
that
natural
movement
of
population.
indeed
the
case
is
a
textbook
because
it
shows
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule.
after
that
flood
in
addition
to
the
center
of
the
black
dayton
population
being
on
the
west
side,
there
was
a
small
residential
area
on
the
east
side
of
dayton
which
is
a
primarily
white
residential
area
along
springfield
street,
in
my
hometown.
and
that
smaller
area
of
black
families
attended
these
schools
that
were
geographically
close
to
them,
washington
elementary
school
and
that
situation
has
not
changed
over
the
years.
and
you
can
look
at
the
figures
for
a
period
of
20
years
and
you'll
find
that
the
elementary
school
that
serves
that
black
neighborhood
has
consistently
remained
between
14
and
23%
black
simply
because
it
like
every
other
school
in
this
system
has
done
nothing
but
reflect
the
residential
racial
populations
served.
mr.
david
c.
greer
you
can
talk
about
--
pardon
me,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
c.
greer
i
hate
to
get
into
the
posture
of
making
a
factual
argument
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
i
don't
think
i
need
to
make
that
argument.
all
i
am
trying
to
do
in
answer
to
the
factual
arguments
that
have
been
made
here
today
is
to
express
what
the
evidence
really
was
and
that
there
was
a
strong
basis
for
the
district
court's
findings
that
should've
been
upheld.
there's
no
clearly
erroneous
--
mr.
david
c.
greer
right.
it's
phrased
in
the
findings
of
fact
in
terms
of
taking
practice
by
practice,
any
of
these
isolated
unconstitutional
practices
that
may
have
existed
historically
and
expressly
finding
that
there
was
no
incremental
segregative
effect
from
those
practices
at
the
time
this
suit
was
filed.
so
this
is
part
of
the
findings
in
the
case
and
i
would
simply
submit
to
you
that
on
both
the
remedy
and
on
the
violation
side
of
this
case,
the
dayton
school
board
was
justified
in
securing
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint.
mr.
david
c.
greer
that
you
can
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
me.
that's
fine.
mr.
david
c.
greer
although
i
don't
think
legally
that
is
correct
but
if
you
should
choose
to
do
so,
i've
met
it.
the
facts
are
there.
the
incremental
segregative
effect
here
is
zero
and
the
appropriate
remedy
is
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint.
again
i
could
answer
every
factual
argument
that's
been
presented
with
regard
to
black
orphans
being
transported
across
town.
in
fact
from
1950
on
they
were
all
placed
in
white
schools
or
i
could
--
but
i
don't
think
i
need
to
go
into
each
of
those
detailed
factual
arguments
before
this
court.
it's
all
in
the
brief.
it's
in
the
judge's
findings
of
fact
and
there
is
evidence
to
support
it
all.
at
its
most
fundamental
level
this
litigation
it
seems
to
me,
poses
a
choice,
a
choice
between
case
by
case
application
of
equitable
principles
and
judicial
legislation
of
racial
balance
through
the
use
of
a
loaded
game
board
of
artificial
presumptions.
the
case
also
presents
focus
on
the
proper
rule
of
intermediate
appellate
courts
in
this
federal
system.
i
would
submit
that
in
an
attempt
to
justify
a
predetermined
result,
the
sixth
circuit
has
rewritten
the
legal
standards
that
have
been
espoused
and
presented
by
this
court
and
it
has
rewritten
the
factual
evidence
that
was
presented
to
the
trial
court.
that
is
not
the
proper
role
of
an
intermediate
appellate
court.
if
the
standards
established
by
this
court
and
the
facts
presented
by
the
trial
court
are
put
together,
they
compel
the
following
answers
to
the
particular
questions
that
are
posed
by
this
case.
was
the
dayton
school
system
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed
segregated
by
reasons
of
acts
of
the
dayton
school
board?
no.
would
the
distribution
of
the
student
population
in
the
dayton
system
have
been
different
at
the
time
of
suit
if
the
school
board
had
not
taken
the
actions
which
the
plaintiffs
have
challenged?
that
ends
the
case.
we
are
addressing
the
court
of
equity
and
i
think
equitable
principles
and
the
facts
here
compel
those
answers
to
those
questions.
thank
you.
