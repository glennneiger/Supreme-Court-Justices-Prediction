we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
627,
dayton
board
of
education
against
brinkman.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
now,
mr.
greer.
chief

that
would
mean
overruling
in
part
the
swann
case,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
caldwell.
chief
justice

e.
burger
and
what
were
the
district
court's
findings
on
the
1972
situation
again?
what
did
the
district
court
find
about
the
condition
in
1972?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
there
we
come
back
to
what
has
been
mentioned
before.
it
is
not
normally
the
function
of
a
reviewing
court
to
make
findings
of
fact,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
if
you're
sending
the
case
back
with
some
instructions,
is
that
not,
more
often
than
ever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
are
--
the
cases
you're
talking
about
are
usually
cases
where
you
have
a
single
issue
or
two
issues,
not
a
whole
maze
of
issues,
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
not
speaking
of
the
more
recent
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
no,
u.s.-jefferson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
caldwell,
in
your
submission,
i
believe
and
i'm
confident
that
it's
the
case
in
your
counterpart's
--
your
colleague's
submission
in
the
columbus
case,
the
school
board
after
a
finding
of
a
violation
is
entitled
to
shoulder
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
violation
did
not
cause
an
incremental
segregative
effect
so
as
to
be
system-wide,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
caldwell.
mr.
days.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it'd
be
a
very
difficult
burden
it
seems
to
me
to
carry.
be
--
we
all
know,
and
the
--
as
even
amateur
historians
that
the
present
is
a
product
of
the
past
and
i'm
sure
nobody
could
argue
with
the
proposition
that
all
sorts
of
conditions
in
the
present
have
their
roots
back
in
the
19th
if
not
the
18th
century.
isn't
that
an
almost
impossible
burden
that
you've
described?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00,
mr.
days.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
won't
you
have
to
say
there,
i
take
it,
mr.
drews,
is
that
the
segregated
faculty
which
terminated,
when,
back
in
1969?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
1974,
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
others
--
i
suppose
there
are
still
possibly
some
students
in
school
who
went
to
school
under
a
segregated
faculty
system.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
very
many?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
kindergarteners
would
still
be
in
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
oppression
on
a
high
school
now,
somewhere.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
was
the
--
when
was
the
montgomery
case
decided
on
faculty
segregation,
about
1968
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
date
'67?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
couple
of
years
prior
to
1967.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
if
they
remedied
that
between
1969
and
1971,
the
schools
were
not
called
upon
until
the
montgomery
holding
to
do
that
as
a
constitutional
matter,
were
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
court
didn't,
they
were
in
the
abstract.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
court
didn't
declare
that
it
was
a
constitutional
requirement
until
the
montgomery
case,
did
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
greer,
you
have
about
eight
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
