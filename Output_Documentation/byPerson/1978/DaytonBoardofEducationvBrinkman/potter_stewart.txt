justice
potter
stewart
now
the
district
court,
on
remand
of
this
case,
judge
rubin
found
that
there
wasn't
a
system-wide
violation,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
ultimately
dismissed
the
case,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
find
any
specific
isolated
constitutional
violations?
justice
potter
stewart
only?
justice
potter
stewart
were
you
in
the
process
of
answering
my
question.
what
was
the
third?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly.
justice
potter
stewart
this
lawsuit
was
brought
in?
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
the
district
court
find
any
--
except
for
considering
the
continuing
effect
of
these
historic
acts
of
unconstitutional
segregation
by
race,
did
he
find
any,
then,
ongoing
conduct
that
violated
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
there's
no
remedy
at
all
until
or
unless
there's
a
finding
of
a
constitutional
violation,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
the
case
we
heard
first
this
morning,
the
columbus
case,
involved
basically
as
i
understood
it
at
least
with
the
concessions
made
by
counsel
particularly,
a
question
of
remedy.
this
case
at
least
initially,
find
--
involves
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
know
it's
both
but
at
least
is
initially
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation,
isn't
it,
because
the
district
court
found
there
wasn't
any?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean,
(voice

racial
imbalance.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
greer,
let's
take
a
school
system
in
that
region
of
the
country
which
up
until
1954
had
legislation
on
the
books
requiring
the
segregation
of
school
children
based
upon
the
color
of
their
skins
and
in
1954,
in
brown
against
board
of
education,
that
legislation
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
certainly
there
--
then
became
incumbent
upon
the
school
boards
of
a
--
in
that
--
of
some
school
district
in
that
part
of
the
country
in
a
state
which
had
had
such
legislation
to
do
something
about
it,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
to
do
--
to
desegregate,
wasn't
it,
an
affirmative
duty?
justice
potter
stewart
it
found
no
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
no
violation
as
of
the
time
of
the
lawsuit,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
had
been,
had
been?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
time
of
the
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
--
i
--
would
seem
to
me
would
have
to
have
found
that
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
had
taken
place
when?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
(voice
overlap)
period.
justice
potter
stewart
it
--
some
time
between
that
--
in
those
some
40
years
--
justice
potter
stewart
42
years
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
process
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
went
over
a
42-year-period.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
stating
--
i
mean,
not
the
state
of
ohio,
technically
because
the
state
of
ohio
since
the
1880s
had
prohibited
precisely
what
you
tell
us
that
dayton
was
doing,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
the
students?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
acting
through
its
legislature.
justice
potter
stewart
hadn't
it
been
the
law
of
ohio
that
these
things
were
illegal
that
you
told
us?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
all
of
these
things
that
you've
told
us
happened
in
spades
in
those
--
in
those
--
that
region
of
the
country
where
the
legislatures
required
them
to
happen,
and
does
that
mean
that
school
districts
in
those
areas
of
the
country
are
always
going
to
be
carnivorous,
will
always
be
tainted
by
their
historic
illegal
unconstitutional
action?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
caldwell,
you
say
--
what
you're
trying
to
convince
us
of
--
but
ordinarily
we
don't
sit
as
finders
of
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
it
be
true
in
almost
every
big
city
in
the
united
states,
new
york
or
chicago?
justice
potter
stewart
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
de
facto
concentration
of
one
race
or
another
in
various
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
in
new
york
city,
if
every
time
they
build
a
new
school
in
harlem,
i
suppose,
it
could
be
reasonably
anticipated
that
that
would
be
populated
a
100%
by
negro
children,
couldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
don't
either.
justice
potter
stewart
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
what
you're
telling
us
was
probably
characteristic
of
every
sizable
city
in
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
so.
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
at
the
time
the
lawsuit
was
brought
and
if
so,
what
the
appropriate
remedy
should
be.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
and
if
so,
and
only
if
so,
what
the
appropriate
remedy
should
be?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
at
the
time
of
this
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
did
this
happen?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
that
situation
didn't
itself
exist
apart
from
the
vestiges
of
its
effects
but
it
didn't
itself
exist
at
the
time
the
lawsuit
was
brought.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
