mr.
burt
braverman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
what
is
known
as
a
reverse-freedom
of
information
act
case,
an
action
to
enjoin
certain
government
agencies
from
disclosing
documents
that
are
asserted
to
be
confidential
in
nature.
the
action
was
brought
against
the
respondent
defense
logistics
agency,
department
of
labor,
department
of
defense.
the
issues
in
this
case
concern
the
extent
to
which
these
agencies
are
prohibited
by
federal
statutes
and
regulations
from
disclosing
confidential
business
information
and
also
the
extent
to
which
the
petitioner
chrysler
corporation
is
entitled
to
a
de
novo
trail.
the
case
arose
as
follows;
the
respondent
agencies
notified
chrysler
that
two
requests
for
disclosure
of
documents
had
been
received
and
that
those
requests
were
made
under
freedom
of
information
act.
they
advised
chrysler
that
it
could
object
to
the
disclosure
of
those
documents
if
it
chose.
the
documents
in
this
case
were
of
two
types.
the
first
called
an
affirmative
action
program
or
an
aap
consisted
of
several
hundred
pages
of
extremely
detailed
employment
data.
the
data
in
essence
was
blue
print
or
a
hand
book
of
the
organization
and
staffing
of
chrysler’s
assembly
plants.
the
second
kind
of
document
involved
was
a
government
report,
which
was
prepared
concerning
a
review
of
those
facilities
and
the
compliance
of
those
facilities
with
various
regulations
applicable
to
government
contractors.
those
government
reports
incorporated
into
them
substantial
portions
of
the
data
that
was
included
in
the
affirmative
action
programs
themselves.
and
i
want
to
note
at
this
point
that
the
data
included
in
chrysler’s
aaps
is
viewed
by
chrysler
as
confidential
in
nature.
it
is
covered
by
various
written
confidentiality
policies
and
practices
of
the
corporation,
and
the
corporation
and
its
employees
are
expressly
restricted
from
disclosing
that
data
either
to
competitors
or
to
the
public.
the
respondents
permitted
written
objections
to
be
filed
to
disclosure.
chrysler
objected
on
essentially
two
bases.
first
it
asserted
that
the
information
was
exempt
from
disclosure
under
exemption
4
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
that
exemption
says
that
the
disclosure
mandate
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
shall
not
apply
to
information,
which
is
confidential
and
commercial
in
nature
or
trade
secret.
and
second
it
asserted
that
disclosure
of
these
documents
was
prohibited
by
the
federal
trade
secrets
act
18
u.s.c.,
section
1905,
which
makes
it
a
crime
for
any
federal
employee
to
disclose
certain
specified
types
of
confidential,
business
statistical
data,
such
as
was
contained
in
the
aaps.
the
respondents
decided
the
issue
against
chrysler
and
informed
chrysler
that
the
documents
would
be
disclosed.
although
chrysler
was
supposedly
afforded
a
right
to
appeal
administratively
from
that
determination,
it
was
not
allowed
to
do
so
because
the
agency
indicated
that
it
would
not
await
the
results
of
that
appeal
prior
to
disclosing
the
documents.
consequently
chrysler
having
exhausted
it's
administrative
remedies
was
compelled
to
institute
an
injunctive
action
in
the
district
court
for
delaware.
following
a
de
novo
trail
in
which
the
district
court
heard
the
testimony
of
expert
witnesses
and
other
witnesses
concerning
the
nature
of
the
information
at
issue
and
the
consequences
of
disclosure
of
that
information
to
the
public,
the
district
court
issued
its
decision
in
which
it
held
that
first
the
information
was
in
fact
exempt
from
disclosure
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
because
it
was
confidential
in
nature
and
because
its
disclosure
would
cause
substantial
competitive
injury
to
chrysler.
and
second
it
held
that
disclosure
of
that
information
would
violate
the
trade
secrets
act
as
well
as
certain
parallel
provisions
of
the
defendant’s
regulations.
consequently
it
enjoined
the
disclosure
of
those
portions
of
the
documents,
which
it
found
to
be
exempt
from
disclosure.
mr.
burt
braverman
yes
sir.
mr.
burt
braverman
that
is
correct.
however
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
of
course
if
the
agency
were
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
disclose
documents
in
violation
of
that
law,
and
to
prevent
that
abuse
of
discretion.
in
an
anticipatory
sense
the
district
court
exercised
its
equitable
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
disclosure.
mr.
burt
braverman
i
believe
it
did
bother
to
follow.
it
realized
that
it
could
not
await
the
disclosure
of
that
information
to
then
remedy
the
problem
because
once
disclosed
the
confidential
information
could
never
be
returned
to
its
original
state.
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
cort
v.
ash
that
there
will
be
implied
a
cause
of
action
under
certain
statutes
where
the
remedy
is
necessary
to
effectuate
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
it
has
applied
that
principle
in
criminal
cases.
and
consequently
the
district
court
did
in
fact
i
think
consider
that
equitable
principle
but
realized
that
the
information
had
to
be
enjoined
prior
to
disclosure.
again
we’re
also
proceeding
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
which
we
asserted
also
provided
a
basis
for
the
district
court
to
enjoin
disclosure
of
the
information.
but
the
basic
answer
is
that
the
court
found
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
and
that
the
apa
permitted
it
to
enjoin
the
--
provide
that
injunctive
remedy.
cross
appeals
were
filed
from
the
district
court’s
decision,
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
district
court
had
erroneously
engaged
in
a
de
novo
trail
that
chrysler’s
cause
of
action
did
not
arise
under
either
the
foia
or
the
trade
secrets
act
but
rather
only
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
it
also
held
that
the
federal
agencies
had
discretion
to
disclose
these
documents
even
if
they
were
exempt
from
disclosure
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
even
if
they
fell
within
the
trade
secrets
act
if
the
agencies
had
some
regulation
which
authorized
that
disclosure.
the
agency
found
however
that
–
the
court
of
appeals
found
however
that
the
agency's
record
that
it
had
compiled
in
the
course
of
deciding
these
issues
was
so
inadequate
as
to
prevent
further
review
and
it
remanded
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
this
court
has
recognized
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
brought
into
existence
to
remedy
what
had
been
perceived
to
be
an
era
of
secrecy
on
the
part
of
government
agencies.
the
object
of
congress
was
that
if
it
could
open
the
processes
of
government
to
greater
public
scrutiny,
those
agencies
and
the
government
itself
would
become
more
accountable
to
the
public.
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
attempting
to
end
this
era
of
secrecy
however,
it
was
aware
that
businesses
such
as
chrysler
submit
vast
amounts
of
business
information
to
federal
agencies
both
voluntarily
and
in
compliance
with
various
regulatory
requirements.
now
some
of
that
information
congress
knew
could
be
disclosed
without
harming
the
businesses
that
provided
it.
but
it
was
also
aware
that
significant
amounts
of
that
information
were
of
a
truly
confidential
nature
and
that
if
that
information
was
disclosed
that
could
impair
the
competitive
or
other
health
of
the
businesses.
at
the
time
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
coming
into
existence
in
its
early
stages
1963,
when
the
senate
hearing
were
being
conducted,
there
was
no
exemption
in
the
act
for
confidential
business
information,
and
this
omission
gave
rise
to
a
great
hue
and
cry
over
the
need
for
such
protection.
interestingly
the
greatest
or
perhaps
the
most
vocal
proponents
of
the
need
to
protect
business
documents
were
the
federal
agencies
themselves.
they
citied
two
principal
reasons
for
the
need
for
this
protection.
first
and
most
obviously
was
the
need
to
protect
businesses,
which
were
either
pursuant
to
regulation
or
in
a
corporative
effect
furnishing
confidential
information
to
the
agencies
to
protect
these
businesses
from
the
harm,
which
could
be
caused
by
disclosure.
and
second
they
realized
that
this
protection
was
the
quit
pro
quo
for
the
agencies’
ability
to
obtain
this
kind
of
information
in
the
future.
if
the
information
were
not
to
be
respected
in
its
confidentiality
the
business
would
no
longer
furnish
that
information.
and
in
reaction
to
this
outcry
for
the
need
for
protection,
congress
in
fact
added
what
is
now
the
fourth
exemption
to
the
freedom
of
information
act.
but
exemption
4
was
considerably
different
than
the
other
exemptions
to
the
act.
the
other
exemptions
and
for
example
exemption
1
or
2
or
5
or
7
dealing
with
national
security
secrets,
dealing
with
investigative
files,
dealing
with
intra-agency
memoranda,
these
exemptions
were
designed
to
protect
governmental
interests.
they
were
designed
to
give
the
agency
the
option,
if
it
need
to,
to
withhold
certain
documents
from
disclosure
because
governmental
interest
might
truly
be
impaired.
but
as
to
this
exemptions
congress
still
made
them
permissive
only,
when
i
say
‘permissive’
it
gave
the
agencies
discretion
to
withhold
those
documents
if
it
needed
to,
but
it
made
clear
in
the
legislative
history
that
those
exemptions
were
not
to
be
invoked
unless
it
was
truly
necessary
to
protect
the
governmental
interest.
mr.
burt
braverman
this
comes
through
in
fact
in
both
the
senate
and
the
house.
it
comes
through
in
the
sense
that
although
there
are
statements
made
concerning
the
permissive
nature
of
the
exemptions
the
only
time
that
they
are
made
is
with
respect
to
those
exemptions
relating
to
governmental
interests.
in
contrast,
when
the
congress
remarked
concerning
exemption
4,
which
was
an
exemption
designed
to
protect
private
interest,
its
statements
were
in
the
sense
of
mandatory
remarks
that
the
exemption
must
be
enforced
and
must
be
utilized
to
protect
those
private
interests.
mr.
burt
braverman
these
are
in
the
committee
reports.
for
example
in
house
report
1497,
the
house
stated
that
exemption
4
and
i
quote,
“would
assure
the
confidentially
of
confidential
business
information
obtained
by
the
government.”
and
during
the
senate
hearings
this
statement
was
made,
“such
protection
must
be
afforded
not
only
as
a
matter
of
fairness
but
-”
again
i
quote,
“but
as
a
matter
of
right.”
congress
--
mr.
burt
braverman
they
obviously
have
their
proponents
and
their
opponents.
the
house
report
in
fact
was
somewhat
more
liberal
in
terms
of
the
protection
to
be
afforded.
but
what
i’m
trying
to
make
clear
is
that
both
the
house
and
senate
indicate
that
the
need
was
there
to
protect
confidential
business
information.
in
fact
even
attorney
general
ramsey
clark,
after
the
act
was
enacted
made
the
statement
that
confidential
business
information
must
be
protected
from
disclosure
and
must
remain
outside
the
zone
of
accessibility.
mr.
burt
braverman
no,
i
don’t
believe
so.
the
act
says
that
where
information
falls
within
an
exemption,
the
act
shall
not
apply.
that’s
clear,
that
is
statutory
language.
but
as
the
court
of
appeal
has
noted
in
the
westinghouse
case,
the
legislative
history
reflected
so
clear,
so
clear
a
purpose
to
protect
that
information
and
to
continue
the
practice
that
had
previously
existed
in
government
of
protecting
confidential
business
information,
that
this
legislative
history,
these
remarks
from
which
i
have
quoted
expressed
an
affirmation,
a
mandate
that
this
information
be
protected.
it
was
not
simply
to
be
something
that
the
government
agencies
have
the
discretion
neither
to
adhere
to
or
not
to
adhere
to.
now
in
this
case
for
example
the
government
takes
the
position
that
even
where
information
falls
within
the
fourth
exemption,
even
where
that
information
is
confidential,
even
where
that
information
would
cause
substantial
competitive
injury
of
disclosed,
the
agency
still
has
discretion
to
disclose
that
information.
we
think
congress
intended
otherwise
and
intended
to
provide
protection
to
that
information.
furthermore
these
statutes
can
be
read
in
tandem
with
the
trade
secrets
act-
mr.
burt
braverman
exemption
4
was
added
in
response
to
the
need
to
protect
the
information.
if
you
read
the
legislative
history,
it
shows
that
there
was
a
concern
for
a
need
for
protection.
congress
added
the
exemption
in
response
to
that
its
intent,
as
viewed
from
the
legislative
history,
was
to
provide
that
protection.
we
think
that
something
more
--
mr.
burt
braverman
i
think
it’s
poor
legislative
drafting
because
i
think
that
they
meant
something
more
than
merely
shall
not
apply,
and
what
has
to
be
done
is
to
be
read
in
the
context
of
what
proceeded
this.
congress
was
attempting
to
reverse
the
practice
of
agency
secrecy
concerning
agency
document.
it
was
not
intending
to
reverse
a
practice
of
agency
respect
for
the
confidentiality
of
business
documents.
as
i
understand
the
legislative
history,
it
was
congress’s
purpose
to
allow
the
agencies
to
continue
that
practice
and
in
fact
it
endorsed
the
practice
of
respecting
confidentiality
of
the
business
documents,
perhaps
the
drafting
could
have
been
clear.
there
are
--
it
is
a,
what
we
believe
to
be
a
mandate
for
confidentiality
in
the
freedom
of
information
act.
yet
in
spite
of
that
mandate
the
court
below
and
the
respondents
to
the
regulations
have
turned
the
act
around
rather
than
providing
protection
for
confidential
business
information
through
the
fourth
exemption,
and
rather
than
serving
as
a
vehicle
for
the
public
to
find
out
about
the
how
the
agency
functions,
the
act
today
has
become
a
principle
method
for
finding
out
about
private
business
activities,
for
finding
out
about
your
neighbor
or
your
competitor,
or
just
about
anybody
who
files
documents
in
the
government.
now
let
me
gave
you
some
examples
to
illustrate
my
point.
the
act
has
become
a
very,
very
frequently
used
vehicle
for
industrial
espionage.
the
food
and
drug
administration
testified
in
congressional
hearings
recently
that
of
the
many
thousands
of
foia
requests,
which
it
receives
annually,
86%
of
those
requests
come
from
corporations
or
corporate
representatives
seeking
to
obtain
private
data
that
has
been
filed
in
either
applications
or
similar
reports
with
that
agency.
the
reports
of
other
agencies
are
the
same.
mr.
burt
braverman
i
do
not
recall
anything
concerning
that
in
the
legislative?
mr.
burt
braverman
i
do
not
recall
that.
there
is
however
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
congress
practice
of
agencies
such
as
the
bureau
of
the
census
and
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics,
which
acquire
information
from
the
public
and
aggregate
it
in
such
way
as
to
maintain
its
confidentiality
because
they
recognized
it
should
not
be
available.
but
there
was
nothing
that
i
know
in
the
legislative
history
on
the
other
point.
mr.
burt
braverman
in
‘67
they
knew
that
this
was
a
practice
that
was
then
conducted
by
sequestering
an
employee
taking
a
photograph.
they
did
not
know
-
mr.
burt
braverman
anyway,
but
they
did
not
realize
that
the
act
–
mr.
burt
braverman
they
didn’t
realize
it
because
they
intended
that
the
fourth
exemption
would
provide
protection.
they
did
-
mr.
burt
braverman
perhaps
they
should
have
more
foresight,
we
wish
they
had.
but
they
did
not,
and
today
the
act
is
being
used
in
that
fashion
indeed
it
is
now
possible
through
the
foia
to
obtain
business
data,
which
could
not
be
legitimately
obtained
under
the
federal
and
state
trade
secret
laws,
fair
practice
laws
but
to
obtain
that
data
simply
by
sending
in
foia
request
to
your
friendly
government
agency
and
saying,
please
give
me
this
application
form,
please
give
me
the
formula
described
in
this
report
and
the
data
is
available.
we
think
this
not
only
cuts
against
the
careful
fabric
of
trade
secret
laws
that
have
been
developed
over
the
years
but
we
also
think
it
raises
very
serious
questions
about
whether
government
agencies
in
disclosing
private
data
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
private
persons,
whether
those
agencies
are
in
fact
impairing
property
rights
in
contravention
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
burt
braverman
absolutely
that
is
in
fact
another
issue
in
the
case
which
i
was
not
going
to
address
today,
but
i
will
say
that
we
do
contend
although
the-
mr.
burt
braverman
-the
court
did
not
agree,
that’s
right
that
exemption
3
incorporates
the
trade
secrets
act
into
the
foia
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
act
not
applicable
to
any
information
which
falls
within
the
trade
secrets
act
and
that
is
an
issue.
mr.
burt
braverman
exemption
3
is
absolutely
mandatory,
yes.
that
is
our
contention.
mr.
burt
braverman
that
is
correct.
another
use
in
fact
that
has
been
made
of
the-
mr.
burt
braverman
exactly
because
those
exemptions
are
designed
to
protect
governmental
interests.
mr.
burt
braverman
it
is
because
of
the
interests
that
they
are
designed
to
protect,
it
is
because
of
the
history
of
section
1905
the
trade
secrets
act
there’s
a
quote
as
incorporated
through
exemption
3.
it
is
not
only
because
of
the,
shall
not
apply
language
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
burt
braverman
that’s
right
and
in
this
--
mr.
burt
braverman
it’s
a
somewhat
circular
process.
if
the
information
is
prohibited
from
being
disclosed
by
1905
and
if
as
we
assert
1905
is
an
exemption
3
statute
then
the
freedom
of
information
act
does
not
apply
to
that
data.
it
cannot
authorize
its
disclosure
because
that
data
is
specifically
exempted
from
disclosure
by
1905.
and
so
in
that
way
the
act
is
rendered
inoperative
and
the
information
is
protected
by
the
trade
secrets
act.
now
this
perversion
of
exemption
4
has
also
been
used
now
to
circumvent
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
a
litigant
who
could
and
should
seek
to
acquire
information
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
in
a
discovery
context
will
make
a
freedom
of
information
act
request
for
private
documents
and
in
that
way
will
circumvent
all
of
the
protections
and
scrutiny
that
the
court
itself
could
provide
with
respect
to
that
discovery
request.
in
fact
that
is
the
case
with
the
two
requests
in
this
case.
the
two
litigants
in
cases
involving
chrysler
desired
to
obtain
information
for
use
in
those
cases
against
chrysler
but
rather
than
proceeding
in
those
actions
where
chrysler
could
have
objected
on
those
basis
of
relevance,
burdensomeness.
it
instead
came
through
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
attempted
to
get
that
information
in
circumvention
of
the
federal
rules.
we
think
this
court
has
frowned
upon
this
practice
in
both
in
robins
tyre,
in
nlrb
v.
sears
roebuck
where
it
indicated
in
an
agency
context
that
the
act
should
not
be
used
for
this
purpose.
and
we
think
that
it
equally
a
bar
to
use
the
act
for
this
purpose
against
a
private
person,
particularly
where
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
do
exist
as
a
means
of
obtaining
this
data.
now
i
mentioned
these
examples
really
to
show
that
the
act
no
longer
is
being
used
to
find
out
about
government
operations
but
instead
is
being
used
to
find
out
about
private
activities.
this
unfortunately
is
not
what
the
act
was
intended
to
accomplish.
in
allowing
these
practices
it
has
the
effect
of
undermining
the
fourth
exemption,
undermining
the
protection
which
that
exemption
was
intended
to
provide
and
of
upsetting
the
balance
that
congress
was
trying
to
fashion
between
the
publics
right
to
know
on
the
one
hand
and
the
business
communities
right
to
be
secure
in
its
property
and
privacy.
we
think
that
the
decision
below
by
recognizing
this
broad
agency
discretion
to
disclose
the
very
kinds
of
documents
which
exemption
4
was
intended
to
protect,
disrupts
the
legislative
scheme
is
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
and
we
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
below.
mr.
burt
braverman
that’s
not
true,
because
at
that
point
the
department
of
defense
would
have
been
prohibited
by
the
trade
secrets
act
from
disclosing
that
to
any
person.
mr.
burt
braverman
if
we
are
right
and
if
the
trade
secrets
act—
mr.
burt
braverman
exactly.
mr.
burt
braverman
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
burt
braverman
this
is
something
of
a
case
where
the
pendulum
has
swung
a
bit
too
far.
congress
was
attempting
to
eliminate
government
secrecy
and
one
way
it
was
going
to
do
that
was
to
get
rid
of
the
so
called
public
interest
standard
that
was
in
section
3
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
the
50s
and
early
60s.
that
public
interest
standard
was
used
to
shield
agency
documents.
now
the
government
is
here
10,12,14
years
later
and
it’s
saying,
“well,
we
are
going
to
decide
these
questions
under
that
public
interest
standard.”
back
then
it
was
the
public’s
right
that
was
being
sacrificed
when
the
agency
exercised
or
mis-exercised
that
public
interest
standard.
today
it’s
the
private
persons
right
that’s
being
sacrificed
when
the
agency
again
lacking
an
adequate
record,
lacking
any
standards,
lacking
any
guidelines
simply
says,
“we’re
going
to
ignore
the
fact
that
disclosure
of
this
information
is
going
to
cause
you
what
the
district
court
found
to
be
substantial
competitive
injury
and
because
of
what
we
perceive
to
be
the
better
way
of
things,
the
public
interest,
we’re
going
to
disclose
those
documents.”
i
don’t
think
congress
ever
intended
that
the
pendulum
swing
so
far
that
the
private
interests
in
their
property
in
their
privacy
be
damaged
like
that.
the
district
court’s
finding
--
mr.
burt
braverman
the
problem
is
that
there
cannot
be
an
adequate
record
in
these
cases.
in
almost
all
of
the
reverse
foia
cases
that
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals,
in
this
case,
in
the
sears
eckerd
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
in
the
general
dynamics
case
in
the
eight
circuit,
the
agency
found
that
the
document
should
be
disclosed,
that
the
reverse
foia
plaintiffs
went
to
court
and
the
district
court
found
that
there
would
be
substantial
competitive
injury
and
then
because
those
courts
found
that
there
should
be
apa
review,
they
remanded,
then
they
did
not
find
that
the
finding
of
competitive
injury
was
improper.
they
simply
said
that
the
agency
should
have
--
should
have
been
the
one
to
examine
whether
there
would
be
injury.
the
problem
is,
is
that
under
the
foia
the
agency
cannot
conduct
an
adequate
fact
finding
inquiry
because
it
doesn’t
have
the
time.
in
this
case
we
were
notified.
mr.
burt
braverman
the
courts,
the
courts
--
mr.
burt
braverman
the
difference
is,
is
that
the
court
is
not
subject
to
the
10-day
limitation
that
is
found
in
the
foia
and
the
agencies
are
and
it
is
simply
impossible
for
an
agency
employee
who
has
no
expertise
in
the
question
of
determining
competitive
injury
to
get
in
some
cases
1000s
of
pages
of
documents
in
front
of
him
and
to
try
to
make
a
judgment
in
a
matter
of
days
and
also
to
assume
that
the
company
itself
can
make
the
kind
of
showing
necessary
in
this
case.
and
this
is
just
impossible
and
this
is
what
gives
rise
to
our
contention,
that
the
agency
fact
finding
procedures
here
are
inadequate.
its
the
procedures,
the
fact
finding
procedure
that
is
inadequate,
not
merely
the
record
in
these
cases
and
under
this
court’s
precedent
in
overton
park
even
if
you
were
to
find
that
the
apa
was
the
proper
basis
for
review,
we
think
you
should
still
find
that
there
is
a
right
to
a
de
novo
trial
until
the
time
that
congress
gets
around
to
saying
that
the
10-day
period
won’t
work
and
i
hasten
to
add
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
amendments
were
in
74
when
the
10-day
period
was
added
were
vetoed
by
the
president
in
part
because
he
expressly
said,
“the
10-day
limit
won’t
work,
it
will
be
impossible
to
operate
under
the
act.”
mr.
burt
braverman
if
regulations
would
qualify
then
perhaps
those
regulations
could
disarm
the
trade
secret
law.
they
would
constitute
authorization
by
law.
mr.
burt
braverman
the
express
affirmation
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
burt
braverman
yes,
yes.
mr.
burt
braverman
it
continued
to
recognize
practice.
mr.
burt
braverman
the
information
as
a
practice.
mr.
burt
braverman
it
was
not
available.
mr.
burt
braverman
i
was
not
available
and
it
provided
mandatory
protection
for
it.
mr.
burt
braverman
if
there
were
regulations,
yes.
mr.
burt
braverman
that
is
it.
mr.
burt
braverman
certainly
it
was
intention
to
eliminate
the
public
interest
standard
that
was
unevenly
applied
by
agencies
by
eliminating
the
public
interest
standard
and
by
putting
in
a
legislative
standard
that
congress
set
and
not
the
agencies,
yes--
mr.
burt
braverman
a
different
view
perhaps
and
also
differing
amounts
of
expertise,
different
perceptions
of
what
--
what
the
public
interest
should
be.
congress
had
the
uniform
perception
of
what
the
--
what
the
public
interest
should
be.
if
i
can
respond
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question,
the
one,
the
one
thing
that
should
be
noted
is
that
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended
agency
regulations
to
constant
--
mr.
burt
braverman
it
would
have
to
be
read
as
a
later
legislative
statement.
