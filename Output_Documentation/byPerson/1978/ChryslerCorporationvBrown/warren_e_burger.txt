chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
922,
chrysler
corporation
against
brown.
mr.
braverman,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
discussing
the
organization
of
business
groups,
who
simply
sort
information
in
the
abstract
then
classified
it
and
sold
it
too,
was
that
developed
in
the
legislative
history?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
parts,
i
wondered
whether
it
was
in
this
history?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
babcock?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
government
need
to
disclose
it
to
the
world
at
large
in
order
to
a
make
use
of
it
for
governmental
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
includes
a
group
of
people
who
might
organize
a
corporation
as
industrial
intelligence
incorporated
gather
the
information,
classify
it
and
then
sell
it
to
the
people
who
are
interested.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
open
to
a
district
judge
confronted
with
this
problem
to
hold
that
the
discretion
under
exemption
4
has
been
abused
in
granting
disclosures?
it’s
a
permissive--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
a
district
judge
say,
well
yes
they
had
discretion
but
here
on
the
record
made
before
me,
the
discretion
has
been
abused.
and
therefore
i
deny
disclosure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
large
amount
of
information
mrs.
babcock
that
government
has
in
its
files
which
is
supplied
voluntarily
by
many
different
industries
in
the
country?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
they
are
not
required
to
furnish
it,
they
furnish
it
or
do
not
furnish
it,
of
their
own
choice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
the
forest
service
for
example,
asks
for
and
receives
a
lot
of
information
which
the
suppliers
need
not
to
give
to
them
if
they
don’t
want
to.
now,
take
that
as
in
one
category
and
there
are
many
others.
the
environmental
people
are
very
much
interested
in
that
the
environmental
people
within
the
government
not
outside
the
government.
now
that
information
which
has
been
voluntarily
furnished
to
the
government
for
its
overall
purposes
is
available
--
is
subject
to
the
freedom
of
information
act,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
its
face
it’s
subject
to
the
act
whether
it
falls
under
an
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
exemption
is
a
second
inquiry.
now
then
is
there
some
--
is
a
court
--
would
the
district
judge
again
be
entitled
take
into
account
or
must
the
agency
itself
take
into
account
whether
that
source
of
information
would
dry
up
if
the
government
disclosed
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
if
their
discretion
comes
into
play
that
is
a
factor
to
weigh,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
anything
in
further
mr.
braverman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
that
you
don’t
agree
--
my
consideration
to
the
congress
that
foia
was
an
effort
to
have
some
harmony
and
the
uniformity
and
among
that
dozens
and
dozens
of
agencies
about
disclosure,
was
that
a
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
it’s
still
unevenly
applied
because
each
agency
has
a
different
view
of
the
exemptions
do
i
understand
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
922,
chrysler
corporation
against
brown
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
