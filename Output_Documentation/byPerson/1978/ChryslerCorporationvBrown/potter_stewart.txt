justice
potter
stewart
mr.
braverman
i
wonder
if
your
argument
really
advances
your
cause
because
the
statutory
language
is
the
same
as
in
--
for
in
terms
of
whether
it’s
permissive
or
mandatory
for
all
six
exemption,
through
7
exemptions
rather.
if
we’re
conceding
in
effect
that
1,
2,
5
and
7
are
permissive
then
the
statute
use
the
same
language
for
3,
4
and
6
may
be
you’re
putting
yourself
in
a
hole.
justice
potter
stewart
exemption
4
was
added
later,
how
do
you
explain
the
failure
to
use
different
language?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
doesn’t
really
explain
why
they
used
statutory
language,
that
had
previously
been
made
clear
to
have
a
permissive
meaning,
to
accomplish
the
purpose
you
describe.
it
is
just
poor
legislative
--
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
exemption
3
--
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
sure
that
it’s
your
view
that
exemption
3
is
more
than
just
permissive
to,
as
you
submit
-
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
neither
under
--
if
material
falls
under
either
exemption
3
or
exemption
4,
the
agency
may
not
waive
for
exemption?
justice
potter
stewart
although
you
can
see,
the
agencies
may
waive
the
other
or
at
least
some
of
the
other
exemptions?
justice
potter
stewart
now
is
this
because
of
the
legislative
history
or
because
of
the
interest
that
are
designed
to
protect
or
because
of
their
language
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
babcock,
isn’t
it
true
that
in
--
we
are
not
to
confront
the
abuse
of
discretion
issue
here,
are
we?
isn’t
that
what’s
left
open
on
the
remand
by
the
third
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
the
issue,
isn’t?
justice
potter
stewart
since
you’re
making
argument
on
merits
because
we
don’t
begin
with
that
as
a
hypothesis
agreed
to
by
both
sides.[laughter].
justice
potter
stewart
what
should
we
do
if
we
disagree
with
you
or
with
the
agency
that
if
this
is
within
exemption
4
namely
really
a
trade
secret
that
the
agency
may
not
release
it.
what
do
we
do
in
this
case?
we
just
took
--
we
certainly
don’t
affirm,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn’t
ask
that.
i
just
asked
what
are
we
--
someone
gave
you
a
hypothetical
and
said
that
if
there
were
really
trade
secrets
involved
here,
could
the
agency
still
release
this
by
exercising
its
balance?
you
said
yes.
and
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
there?
if
there
are
trade
secrets
involved
here,
the
agency
may
not
release
them,
then
what
do
we
do?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
circumstances
they
may
not
release
them?
justice
potter
stewart
well
suppose
we
do,
what
do
we
need
to
--?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
but
that
may
happen
time
and
again
here
and
--
but
nevertheless
would
you
lose
your
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
if
we
or
what
if
we
found
that
1905
prevented
the
agency
from--
even
if
exemption
4
was
permissive,
exemption
3
invokes
1905
and
that
the
agency
may
not
release
the
materials
under
1905.
justice
potter
stewart
if
an
agency
regulation
is
a
law?
justice
potter
stewart
within
the
meaning
of
1905.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
your
argument
would
--
that
view
of
the
statute
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
with
respect
to
material
covered
by
the
exemptions,
one
just
disregards
the
freedom
of
information
act,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
that
--
anything
covered
by
the
nine
exemptions,
one
just
pretends
the
freedom
of
information
act
had
never
been
enacted
and
that’s
a
result
of
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
if
so
forget
the
freedom
of
information
act,
isn’t
that
right?
doesn’t
that
follow?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
subject
to
1905
and
may
be
other
laws?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
but
the
agency
may
or
may
not
have
discretion
but
whether
or
not
it
does
is
to
be
determined
by
laws
other
than
the
freedom
of
information
act?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
follows
your
argument,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
agency
first
of
all
your
answer
must
be
the
agency
has
whatever
power
it
may
have
or
had
or
may
have
not
had
without
any
consideration
under
freedom
of
information
act?
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
claim
is
that
power
includes
agency
discretion
and
that’s
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
that’s
your
contention?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
under
the
--
without
the
freedom
of
information
act
before
it
was
even
passed
1905
is
on
the
books.
suppose
the
agency
could
by
a
set
of
regulations
provide
for
the
release
of
the
information
covered
by
1905.
suppose
that
regulations
would
qualify
as
a
law.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
unless
suppose
that
and
then
comes
the
freedom
of
information
act.
you
say
that
--
you
say
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
would
forbid
the
disclosure
of
what
the
agency
could
have
disclosed
before
the
act.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
or
no.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
exemption
4
and
its
legislative.
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
sure
that’s
your
submission.
