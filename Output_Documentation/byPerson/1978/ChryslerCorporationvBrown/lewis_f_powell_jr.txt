justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
court
of
appeals
find
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
findings
made
by
the
district
court?
the
district
court
found
that
the
information
was
confidential;
it
also
founded
a
fact
the
release
of
it
would
be
adverse
to
the
interest
of
chrysler.
now
were
those
findings
found
to
be
without
substantial
support
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
for
purposes
of
deciding
this
case,
do
you
think
we
must
accept
those
findings
by
the
district
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
do
we
do
with
them?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
this?
let’s
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
case
does
go
back
and
these
findings
are
reaffirmed
say
by
the
agency.
i
understand
you’re
your
argument
that
the
agency
in
its
balancing
discretion
nevertheless
may
release
them,
right?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
well
next
question
is
this.
would
it
be
possible
for
the
agency
under
the
regulations
that
now
exist
or
under
new
regulations
the
right
to
say
all
of
them,
companies
in
the
automobile
industry
and
say,
i
know
you
all
want
those
information
on
your
competitors
rather
than
put
us
to
the
trouble
of
arranging
for
you
to
have
them
copied
here,
from
thereon
send
carbon
copies
of
everything
you
send
us,
in
this
case
to
ford,
general
motors,
and
american
motors.
would
that
be
appropriate?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
because
the
records
show
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
record
in
this
case
show
what
interest
an
agency
has
in
making
this
information
available
to
competitors
of
chrysler?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
could
be.
couldn’t
they?
any
of
them
of
the
public.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
the
information
be
denied
if
one
showed
up
and
said,
i
represent
general
motors
and
i
would
like
to
have
this
information?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
rather
large
“if.”
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
madam
attorney
general,
who
in
fact
made
the
decision
in
this
case
that
this
material
should
be
released
in
the
public
interest?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
but
what
troubles
me
is
normally
if
someone’s
rights
are
affected
even
in
the
bureaucracy
you
can
identity
who
has
made
a
decision
and
can
perhaps
have
a
chance
talk
to
him
or
her?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
a
decision
was
made
initially
without
any
record
i
take
it,
that’s
why
the
case
is
here.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
a
written
guidelines
or
standards
as
to
what
elements
ought
to
be
considered
in
making
a
judgment
as
to
what
is
or
is
not
in
the
public
interest?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
absence
of
something
like
that,
the
discretion
would
be
virtually
limitless,
wouldn’t
it?
