john
paul
stevens
mr.
braverman,
i
am
puzzled
by
your
reliance
on
3,
because
the
condition
of
coming
within
3
is
it
some
other
statute
mandate
non-disclosure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
how
can
3
be
the
source
of
the
mandate
for
non-disclosure,
you
don’t
even
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don’t
see
how
any
of
that
has
any
relevance
if
the
information
is
in
fact
trade
secret
and
confidential.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
fact
it
has
been
asked
for,
does
not
make
any
difference
than
census
information
or
anything
else,
doesn’t
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
it
depends
on
which
point
of
view
you
look
at
it
from
but
do
we
not
start
with
the
assumption
that
some
of
this
information
is
confidential
or
trade
secret
information
within
the
meaning
of
exemption
4?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
district
court
so
found
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
doing
nothing
because—
to
be
sure
i
have
your
position
well
in
mind,
you
do
take
the
position,
the
united
states
takes
a
position
and
even
if
exemption
4
applies
and
even
if
the
information
is
a
trade
secret,
a
bonafide
genuine
trade
secret,
they
may
nevertheless
in
their
discretion
decide
to
disclose
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
would
harm
the
proponent
of
the
information?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
--
general
motors
was
denied,
they
just
asked
their
friendly
newspaper
to
go
get
it
for
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
provision
for
a
delay
in
the
release
of
the
information
during
the
administrative
procedure?
here
as
i
remember
they
give
a
five-day
notice
and
there
is
an
objection,
they
are
going
to
release
it
anyway.
so
they
had
to
go
into
federal
court.
how
is
that
problem
handled
now
or
could
be
handled
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
can’t
be,
but
must
there
be?
there
can
be,
nut
must
there
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
still
possible
the
agency
can
say,
well
we
did
objections
but
we’re
going
to
go
ahead
and
release
it,
we’ll
have
our
hearings
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
have
got
the
view,
and
the
view
is,
“please
don’t
release
it.”
can
they
still
release
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
another
words
if
you
have
the
same
thing
given
all
over
again
under
the
apa
procedure
that
we
had
in
this
case,
but
just
with
a
little
better
record,
is
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
they
say
it
will
take
15
days
to
have
the
hearing
or
something
like
that?
they
were
going
to
release
it
in
the
meantime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i’m
trying
to
find
out
is
there
a
duty
under
the
administrative
procedure
to
withhold
release
until
there
has
been
a
reasoned
decision
by
the
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
happened
in
this
case.
it
happened
in
this
very
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
said
they
were
going
to
within
five
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
only
didn’t
do
it
because
they
went
to
court
and
now
the
third
circuit
said
we
have
no
business
in
court.
your
remedy
is
before
the
apa
and
as
i
understand
your
answers
before
the
apa
you
cannot
prevent
disclosure.
you’ve
said
two
things;
one
under
the
third
circuit
you
cannot
go
to
court;
your
only
remedy
is
before
the
apa.
the
second
thing
you’ve
said
is
if
you
go
before
the
apa
there
are
no
way
you
can
stop
a
release
in
five
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is
what
guarantee
do
they
have
that
the
information
will
not
be
released
while
they
are
trying
to
make
a
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
saying
with
the
wrong
procedure,
well
they
do,
you
concede
they
have
right
to
go
to
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right
then
comes
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
you
say
that
what
was
previously
available
is
now
unavailable.
