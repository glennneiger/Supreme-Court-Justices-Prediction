but
the
regulation
have
to
be
adopted
after
notice
and
chance
for
comment
or
wouldn’t
just
an
ordinary
house
keeping
regulation
be
sufficient?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
must
be
valid,
but
must
they
be
the
kind
that
are
adopted
after
a
notice
and
after
public
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
locked

--
did
the
freedom
of
information
act
lock
up
something
that
was
available
before
or
not?
justice

r.
white
you
said
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.

before
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
passed

information
was
available
even
though
under
1905
because
the
agency
had
provided
for
release
by
regulations.

byron
r.
white
that’s
my
advice
to
your
submission.
justice
byron
r.
white
i’m
quite
aware
of
that
--
i’m
quite
aware
of
that,
but
your
submission
is
that
even
if
it
did
the
freedom
of
information
act
changed
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
