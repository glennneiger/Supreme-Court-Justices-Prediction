ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
at
the
offset
we
should
put
this
case
in
context,
this
is
not
a
strange
new
animal
on
the
legal
landscape.
the
issues
here
are
old
and
familiar
ones,
whether
an
agency
has
abused
its
discretion
or
acted
contrary
to
law
in
a
decision
that
it
made.
nothing
and/or
about
the
freedom
of
information
act
changes
the
approach
that
this
court
took
a
year
before
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
passed
and
the
federal
communications
act,
federal
communications
commission
versus
schreiber,
381
us
279.
there
the
court,
this
court
upheld
the
discretion
of
the
fcc
to
hold
public
hearings
against
the
objections
of
a
private
corporation
much
the
same
as
the
objections
that
are
being
made
here
that
public
view
of
his
records
would
cause
competitive
harm
and
would
ruin
the
american
economy.
the
authority
of
the
fcc
to
hold
these
public
hearings
was
found
in
their
authorizing
statute,
which
says
that
they
could
conduct
proceedings
in
such
a
manner
as
were
best
conduced
to
the
proper
dispatch
of
business
and
to
the
ends
of
justice.
and
this
court
found
in
that
context
that
the
decision
of
the
fcc
to
hold
public
hearings
to
expose
this
information
to
the
public
was
completely
within
its
discretion.
we
have
all
in
way
followed
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
yes
it
is,
but
i
think
that
here
this
court
should
take
the
approach
-
should
mandate
the
approach
in
this
kind
of
case,
which
we
have
all
fallen
into
the
habit
of
calling
reverse
freedom
of
information
act
cases.
they
are
not
freedom
of
information
act
cases.
they
are
administrative
procedure
act
cases
and
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
was
exactly
right.
if
the
record
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
it
is
the
issue
and
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
oh
no,
it’s
certainly
not
agreed
to
by
both
sides,
but
that
is
the
point
that
i
am
making
here,
which
is
that
these
very
kinds
of
issues
which
is
the
balancing
of
the
public
and
-
the
public
interest
in
knowing
and
the
private
interest
in
concealing-
these
have
risen
before
to
this
court
in
other
context,
and
there
is
nothing
about
the
freedom
of
information
act
that
changes
that-
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
not
at
all
your
honor,
i
think
that’s
a
very
important
point,
the
agency
is
not
a
disinterested
bystander;
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
records
that
are
complied
here
are.
these
are
records,
which
are
demanded
from
government
contractors
as
a
condition
of
getting
a
government
contract.
that
people
in
chrysler
has
100s
and
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
these
government
contracts
and
as
a
condition
they
must
supply
this
information
to
the
government
in
the
form
that
the
government
requires
it
and
the
agency
has
an
interest
in
continuing
to
get
that
kind
of
information
from
chrysler
that
has
an
interest
in
protecting
chrysler
if
that
information-
the
disclosure
of
that
information
will
in
the
future
make
information
less
secure.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
no
it
doesn’t
need
to
disclose
it
to
the
world
at
large,
except
this
particular
kind
of
information
which
is
equal
employment
opportunity
information
has
been
found
under
the
regulations
of
the
labor
department
and
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance
to
be
useful
for
disclosure.
the
public
has
an
interest
in
knowing
how
the
government
is
doing
in
its
enforcement
of
equal
employment
opportunity
and
so
that
this
is
peculiarly
a
kind
of
information
in
which
there
may
be
some
public
interest
that
an
agency
should
evaluate.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
why
does
the
agency
have
more
interest?
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
it
doesn’t
conclude
that
it
has
more
of
an
interest
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
it
does
say
that
peculiarly
there
is
a
current
interest
in
the
enforcement
of
the
executive
order
and
that
the
--
but
it
is
not
--
but
there
may
be
a
equal
interest
in
procurement
or
any
of
those
other
matters.
so
that
the
whole
basis
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
that
the
public
does
have
an
interest
in
the
whole
range
of
governmental
activities.
but
i
think
that
the
real
point
here
is
that
these
are
not
--
the
clear
bright
line
cannot
be
drawn
between
what
are
public
and
private
records.
these
records
here
being
created
for
the
government
at
the
command
of
the
government
in
return
for
government
contract,
and
needed
by
the
government
for
the
enforcement
of
a
program
that
is
a
subject
of
an
executive
order
and
that
is
one
of
the
major
government
programs,
how
can
you
call
these
private
records?
and
if
they
are
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
yes
they
are.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
well
mr.
justice
stevens
that’s
what
i
was
just
going
to
reach.
if
there
is
incorporated
into
this
record
created
for
the
government,
if
there
is
incorporated
necessarily
real
trade
secrets
or
confidential
commercial
information
then
there
is
the
possibility
of
the
submitter
challenging
both
at
the
agency
level,
the
release
of
that
information
and
then
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
accord
that
the
agency
has
gone
beyond
its
authority
as
acted
contrary
to
law
has
misapplied
its
regulations
and
that’s
plenty
of
protection,
that’s
sufficient
protection.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
well,
we
can’t
start
--
we
can’t
really
start
with
that.
that
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
subjects
of
the
remand
in
this
case.
that
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
the
district
court
so
found,
yes.
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
record
was
not
sufficient
to
determine
whether
the
agency
had
decided
that
exemption
4
applied
or
whether
it
didn’t
apply
and
so
that
is
an
issue
for
another
day.
now
for
the
purposes
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
yes
sir,
under
certain
regulations
though
and
that
is
if
the
disclosure
is
in
the
public
interest
and
if
the
disclosure
would
not
harm
the
agencies’
ability
to
gather
information
or
to
do
its
job
in
the
future
so
that
they
aren’t
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
even
though
it
is
confidential
commercial
information,
it
is
--
what
we
are
talking
about
here
under
these
regulations
is
a
balancing,
and
the
balancing
has
to
be
the
harm
to
the
submitter
of
the
information
and
the
benefit
to
the
public,
and
the
need
for
the
public
in
the
interest
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
no,
mr.
justice
powell
in
essence
the
third
circuit
just
kind
of
leaped
over
the
district
court
opinion.
the
district
court
opinion
was
very,
very
narrow
here
and
dealt
only
--
chrysler
was
challenging
the
release
of
all
of
the
information.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
because
what
i
would
ask
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
what
you
do
with
them
is
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
--
which
sort
of
skipped
over
the
findings
of
the
district
court
[laughter]
and
said
that
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
agency
for
a
further
record
and
mandated
the
creation
of
the
kind
of
record
which
would
allow
a
district
court
to
review
these
kinds
of
cases
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
that’s
correct
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
no
that
would
not
be
appropriate
because
the
agency
has
a
function
here
and
the
agency
--
and
we
really,
i
don’t
think
can
down
play
this.
the
agency
has
an
interest
in
continuing
to
get
information
and
the
agency
has
an
interest
in
not
upsetting
its
contractors
and
it
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
it
has
an
interest
in
doing
an
appropriate
balance
and
it
has
the
expertise.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
no
it
does
not
and
i
think
it
should
be
made
very
clear
that
the
requestors
in
this
case
are
not
competitors
of
chrysler
and
in
fact
in
the
vast
majority
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
any
of
them
--
there
is
no
distinction
made
among
the
requestors
but
if
we
look
at
the
real
world
and
what’s
really
happening
in
the
so
called
reverse
freedom
of
information
act
cases,
the
requestors
are
not
the
competitors.
the
requestors
are
members
of
the
public,
newspaper
people,
public
interest
groups,
potential
plaintiffs
and
actual
plaintiffs
in
discrimination
suits
that’s
who
the
requestors
have
been
in
these
cases.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
that’s
--
no
it
wouldn’t
except
that
in
the
balancing
that
the
agency
does
and
in
the
administrative
record
that
the
agency
would
make
though
the--
it
would
certainly
i
think
be
taken
into
account
when
you
weigh
the
interest
of
chrysler
in
withholding
the
information
who
the
requestor
was.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
that’s
certainly
true
and
that’s
why
the
act
--
i
mean
that’s
one
of
the
problems
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
that
there
is
no
way
to
distinguish
among
requestors
but
i
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
that
is
happening
and
that
is
certainly
a
distressing
aspect
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
but
that
is
not
--
it
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
this
case
and
i
think
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
your
honor,
you
don’t
have
a
record
here,
which
would
allow
you
to
find
that
this
is
information
that-
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
what
you
would
have
to
do
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
what
you
would
have
to
do
as
a
legal
matter
your
honor
is
to
find
that
exemption
4
is
mandatory.
now
you
can’t
find
that
i
think
in
the
face
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
if
you
do,
i
would
submit
you’ve
made
an
incorrect
legal
procedure.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
if
you
find
that
exemption
4
is
mandatory,
we
certainly
lose
our
case.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
well
1905
--
you
don’t
--
if
you
find
that
1905
applies
here
and
that
these
materials
should
have
been
withheld
under
1905,
then
you
don’t
need
to
reach
the
point
of
whether
it
is
an
exemption
3,
whether
1905
is
an
exemption
3
statute.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
if
the
agency
has
held
a
hearing
and
decided
that
the
material
should
be
released
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
absolutely
and
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
well
the
“if”
being
if
the
agency
has
held
a
hearing
your
honor
or
--?
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
if
the
agency
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
exactly
and
that
is
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case,
and
yet
i
would
draw
your
attention
to
this
court’s
opinion
in
player
versus
osterlind
(ph)
in
which
there
was
a
subpoena
from
the
board
of
tax
appeals
to
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
for
the
tax
returns
of
twelve
corporations.
and
this
case
was
under
the
predecessors
statute
to
1905,
one
of
the
predecessors
of
statutes.
and
there
this
court
held
that
1905
was
raised
as
a
defense
the
commissioner
said,
i
can’t
give
up
these
records
because
i
would
be
in
violation
of
the
statute.
and
there
the
court
--
this
court
said
that
1905
cannot
be
deemed
to
forbid
disclosures
made
in
obedience
to
process
lawfully
issued,
now
that
was
a
subpoena,
that
was
not
a
statute,
that
was
also
not
at
a
regulation,
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit,
but
it
was
not
a
statute.
so
they’re
certainly
authorized
by
law
within
the
meaning
of
1905
goes
beyond
the
strict
requirements
of
a
statute,
and
i
would
also
call
to
the
court’s
attention
that
a
statute
that
tracks
1905
exactly
has
been
put
into
the
irs
code
of
1954,
and
this
is
26
us
code
7213
and
that
is
just
like
1905
in
terms
of
being
a
criminal
statute
and
in
the
laflin
case
the
dc
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
43,
the
dc
--
third
circuit
specifically
that
regulations
permitting
release
of
this
kind
of
information
covered
by
1905
for
use
of
grand
juries
was
authorized
by
law.
so
that
there
are
--
and
there
are
other
citations
in
our
brief
and
then
there
is
a
general
and
legal
principle
that
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
the
regulations
must
be
valid
your
honor
and
so
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
we
would
certainly
urge
that
these
regulations
were
valid.
this
pattern
of
regulations
are
valid,
now
that
would
be
one
of
the
issues
to
be
raised
by
submitters
in
their
challenge
to,
under
the
apa,
which
is
the
design
that
were
arguing
here.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
yes
i
think
that
--
yes
under
the
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
that
--
under
the
standard
of
review
that
we’re
arguing,
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
it
would
be
open
to
the
district
court
to
say
that
the
agency
committed
a
clear
error
of
judgment.
and
it
would
also
go
to
whether
the
agency
acted
within
the
scope
of
its
authority,
mr.
justice
white’s
concern
with
whether
the--
whether
the
regulations
that
it
was
acting
under
were
properly
promulgated,
were
proper
regulations
whether
the
agency
followed
its
own
regulations,
all
of
those
things
would
be
open
to
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
the
scheme
that
the
third
circuit
devised
and
that
we
are
urging
here.
i
want
to
return
just
for
a
minute
to
the
point
that
exemption
4
cannot
be
correctly
read
as
being
mandatory.
mr.
braverman
says
that
perhaps
in
trying
to
make
it
to
mandatory,
congress
could
have
been
a
little
clear
or
that
they
couldn’t
have
been
any
clear,
they
included
it
within
the
other
nine
exemptions
and
they
started
out
the
heading
to
the
nine
exemptions
with
that
this
act
compelling
disclosure
does
not
apply
to
the
nine
exemptions,
so
that
the
exemptions
themselves
neither
direct
disclosure
nor
direct
withholding.
the
exemptions
are
set
out
in
the
statutory
pattern
and
it
really
could
not
be
more
plain
that
they
are
a
guide
to
the
agency
in
deciding
whether
to
disclose
or
whether
to
withhold.
in
the
starkest
terms
exemption
4
can’t
be
mandatory
because
congress
if
it
had
made
exemption
4
and
there
is
no
distinction
between
exemption
4
and
any
other
exemption,
other
exemptions
cover
private
information
also.
they
would
have
if
they
had
made
these
exemptions
mandatory
created
a
withholding
statute
that
went
far
beyond
what
the
law
was
before
the
freedom
of
information
act.
and
literally
i
mean
congress
cannot
be
that
stupid
when
they
were
trying
to
make
a
freedom
of
information
act
that
they
created
a
withholding
statute
is
not
possible,
and
that
would
have
to
be
the
result
of
finding
exemption
4
to
be
mandatory.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
that’s
correct
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
in
a
sense,
i
mean
the
analysis
would
be
that,
does
the
information
fall
within
an
exemption.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
if
it
does,
the
act
does
not
apply
and
then
the
agency
may
decide
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
subject
to
non-disclosure
statutes,
subject
to
the
public
interest
and
disclosures
and
the
agencies
often
decide
to
withhold
on
the
basis
of
one
of
the
exemptions.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
that’s
exactly
right
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
that
is
my
argument.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
it
would
be
taken
--
in
practical
terms
it
would
be
taken
into
account
in
the
balancing
that
is
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
it
is
that
--
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
once
it
is
decided
that
material
falls
within
the
act,
then
the
act
does
not
--
it
falls
within
one
of
the
exemptions,
then
the
act
does
not
apply.
however
when
the
agency
then
goes
on
to
say,
should
we
release
this
material?
we
don’t
--
it
falls
within
one
of
the
exemptions,
so
it
is
not
mandatorily
released,
but
we’re
are
going
to
go
on
and
we
are
going
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
public
interest
requires
it,
whether
there
are
other
interests,
whether
they’re
non-disclosure
statutes.
one
of
the
things
that
the
agency
might
well
take
into
account
are
the
same
concerns
that
caused
congress
to
pass
exemption
4.
it
wouldn’t
actually
be
applying
exemption
4
but
it
would
be
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
no
mr.
justice
marshall
that
is
not
true.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
the
agency
--
if
it
falls
within
exemption
4
then
the
act
does
not
apply.
the
act
does
not
require
the
agency
to
release
the
information.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
the
agency
may
release
your
property
if
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
do
so.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
exactly
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
of
course
it
does
and
it
has
since
1789
when
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
yes
and
i
continue
to
make
it.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
they
didn’t
and
certainly
i’m
not
saying
--
this
is
a
tool
of
analysis
in
terms
of
reading
the
statute.
i’m
not
saying
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
not
implicated
in
any
analysis
here,
but
it
is
--
certainly
the
exemption
4
is
not
mandatory
and
once
it’s
decided
that
material
falls
within
exemption
4
the
agency
may
withhold
them
and
fight
the
requester
or
they
may
move
on
and
decide
whether
within
their
regulations,
within
the
statute,
within
the
public
interest,
it
is
wise.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
that’s
exactly
right,
that
is
the
point.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
if
the
agency
had
so
far
misread
and
the
remand
in
this
case
seems
to
take
that
into
account,
if
the
agency
had
so
far
misread
exemption
4
that
it
was
a
clear
error
in
judgment,
so
as
to
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
to
be
contrary
to
law
then
the
district
court
could.
the
short
answer
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
voluntary
mr.
chief
justice,
i
mean
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
they
furnish
it
because
of
their
interest
in
getting
government
contracts
and
getting
the
government
on
their
side,
persuading
the
government
to
do
what
they
wanted
to
do.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
it
could
be.
i
don’t
see
offhand
why
it
would
fall
under
any
of
the
exemptions,
but
it
might.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
certainly.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
certainly
and
it
actually
in
these
regulations
that
we’re
concerned
with
in
this
case
that
is
one
of
the
considerations
that
the
agency
applies.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
oh
if
the
act
is
applicable-
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
if
the
act
is
applicable,
it
must
release,
but
if
it
falls
with
an
exemption
and
not
as
assuming,
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
yes,
and
it’s
a
factor
that
it’s
built
into
the
regulations
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
the
record
in
the
-
some
functionaries
in
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance
made
the
decision.
the
record
in
this
case
is
not
--
the
administrative
record
is
no
--
there’s
nothing
wonderful
for
either
side
in
this
case,
so
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
and
that’s
exactly
what
the
effect
of
this
opinion
would
be
that
the
remand
in
this
case,
and
if
this
court
would
mandate
this
as
a
proper
procedure,
is
for
the
agency
to
make
a
proper
record
on
whether
the
materials
falls
into
exemption
4
and
then
why
they
have
found
it
is
in
the
public
interest
for
it
to
be
a
released?
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
the
decision
--
the
record
is
inadequate.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
there
are
not
any
in
the
actual
regulations
that
we
have
it
at
issue
here.
but
it
will
certainly
be
possible
to
develop
on
these
kinds
of
cases,
and
i
think
that
would
be
the
result
of
the
regular
review
under
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
of
an
adequate
agency
record
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
if
it
were
virtually
limitless
that
would
be
subject
to
attack
i
think
under
the
apa
as
being
beyond
the
agency's
discretion
that
it
shouldn’t
be
virtually
limitless
there
are
regulations.
let
me
just
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
the
problem
can
be
handled
in
a
number
of
ways.
there
is
a
ten
day
period
and
then
there
are
four
unusual
circumstances
which
could
well
be
the
objection
by
a
submitter.
there
can
be
another
ten
day
period
for
exceptional
circumstances.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
i
think
they
would
probably
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
if
the
procedure
set
out
here
for
review
for
submitters
under
the
apa
were
followed
then
the
agency
would
have
every
interest
in
getting
the
submitter’s
view
and
having
an
adequate
record.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
they
can
still
release
it
certainly,
but
the
submitter
can
go
to
court
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
but
that’s
a
big
difference.
i
mean
that’s
a
very,
very
substantial
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
no,
they
wouldn’t
release
it
in
the
meantime
because
the
submitter
is
going
to
go
to
court
and
get
as
they
have
in
all
of
these
cases
and
get
a
preliminary
injunction
against
their
releasing
it.
so
there
hasn’t
been
any
case.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
there
isn’t
any
duty,
but
it
has
never
happened
that
the
agency
has
done
that.
they
have
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
it
hasn’t.
the
agency
has
not
released
the
information
itself.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
but
they
didn’t
do
it.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
i
understand
mr.
justice
stevens
where
the
-–
where
our
problem
is,
or
my
problem
which
is
i
don’t
mean
before
the
apa.
i
mean,
under
the
apa
in
the
district
court.
the
apa,
the
administrative
procedure
act
should
provide
the
standard
of
review
in
the
district
court
for
the
submitter’s
cases.
they
should
make
their
record
with
the
agency,
but
before
--
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
they
have
the
ability
to
go
to
court-
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
--
to
stop
it
from
being
released.
ms.
barbara
b.
babcock
yes,
absolutely
and
the
only
thing
that
we
are
concerned
with
is
the
standard
of
review
and
the
statute
under
which
it’s
reviewed
and
they
would
still
have
that
same
right
and
in
fact
they
have
exercised
it
freely.
in
closing,
let
me
say
that
though
i
started
by
saying
that
this
not
a
freedom
of
information
act
case,
it
is
obvious
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
implicated
here
and
in
the
court’s
decision
and
we
are
in
great
need
of
direction
from
the
court
in
this
kind
of
case,
we
ask
that
you
mandate
the
orderly
procedure
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
which
the
third
circuit
has
established
that
you
hold
that
neither
exemption
4
or
for
that
matter
any
other
exemption
is
mandatory,
that
you
find
the
validly
issued
regulations
are
authorization
by
law
and
that
you
act
in
this
opinion
in
truth
to
the
spirit
of
the
(inaudible)
with
which
all
it
faults
and
burdens
and
it’s
daily
difficult
balancing
is
bringing
a
measure
of
openness
to
the
government
that
is
unprecedented
and
which
was
the
intent
of
congress.
