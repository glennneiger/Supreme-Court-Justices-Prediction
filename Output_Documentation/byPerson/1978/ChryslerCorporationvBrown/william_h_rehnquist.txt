justice

rehnquist
when
you
say
the
trade
secrets
act
counselor,
you
mean
18
u.s.c.
1905?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn’t
one
of
the
black
letter
principles
of
equity
that
court
of
equity
will
not
enjoin
a
criminal
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you’re
stating
then
it
just
didn’t
bothered
to
follow
what
is
on
the
black
letter
principle
of
equity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
legislative
history
are
you
talking
about
senate
or
the
house?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
committee
report?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
always
had
the
feeling
that
one
with
a
house
report
was
written
by
the
proponents
and
the
senate
report
was
written
by
the
opponents
or
vice
versa,
i
find
those
reports
quite
contradicting?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know
congress
did
provide
some
protection
for
the
kind
of
thing
you
talk
about.
in
our
decision
in
the
robertson
case
for
example,
where
disclosure
is
prohibited
by
some
other
law
then
the
agency
at
the
very
least
need
not
disclose
it
and
probably
cannot
disclose
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
the
enactment
of
foia
mr.
braverman,
i
take
it
if
you
had
been
defending
chrysler
against
a
private
litigant
in
the
united
states
district
court
that
private
litigant
would
have
been
free
to
go
to
the
department
of
defense
and
say,
“look
we
got
a
law
suit,
will
you
give
us
some
papers
that
you’ve
got
here?”
and
the
department
of
defense
could
have
given
it
to
them
without
the
necessity
of
going
through
the
compliance
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
department
of
defense
isn’t
the
defendant
in
the
private
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
are
right,
they
still
are.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
in
each
case
the
remedy
would
be
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
in
the
schreiber
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
schreiber
case
it
was
an
agency
proceeding,
the
agency
was
really
an
interested
party
in
conducting
those
hearings,
was
it
not?
and
here
it’s
more
less
just
a
bystander
saying,
“look
through
our
files
if
you
want
to-
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
it
have
more
of
an
interest
in
that
area
than
in
any
number
of
other
areas
where
the
department
of
defense
receives
information?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
does
the
agency
conclude
that
the
public
has
more
information
in
the
equal
employment
operations
of
the
department
of
defense
say
then
in
the
procurement
regulations
or
the
personnel
policies
of
the
veterans’
preference
or
something
else?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
1905
--
if
agency
is
held
a
hearing
and
decided
that
the
material
should
be
released,
1905
by
definition
does
not
apply.
isn’t
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
1905
by
definition
does
not
prohibit
its
release
since
it’s
been
--
if
is
an
agency
regulation
will
bring
it
within
the
as-authorized
by
law
clause
of
1905.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
general
babcock,
i
thought
you
had
said
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you
that
in
their
hearing
that
the
agency
would
conduct
that
the
exemption
4
would
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
release.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
is
that
consistent
with
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
a
district
court
reverse
the
agency
under
the
apa
abuse
of
discretion
standard
when
the
agency
had
decided
to
release
the
information
if
the
district
courts
felt
that
it
should
have
applied
exemption
4
and
not
released
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that,
what
was
purported
to
be
on
the
part
of
congress
an
act
setting
a
floor
under
disclosure
by
the
agency
in
your
view
set
a
ceiling
and
at
least
once.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
justice
white’s
question
was
that
did
the
freedom
of
information
act
change
the
previous
practice.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
petitioner
in
this
case
chrysler
corporation
has
numerous
contracts
with
the
government.
one
of
the
conditions
of
those
contracts
is
that
to
provide
reports
and
statistical
information
to
specific
government
agencies
in
order
to
show
that
it
is
not
discriminating
in
employment
on
the
basis
of
race
or
sex
and
is
making
acceptable
affirmative
action
efforts.
a
third
party,
someone
not
involved
the
contracts
between
chrysler
and
the
government
made
a
freedom
of
information
act
request
to
obtain
some
of
the
reports.
the
relevant
government
agency
told
chrysler
it
intended
to
release
the
information
to
the
requesting
party.
and
chrysler
then
filed
this
action
in
the
federal
district
court
in
delaware.
in
the
district
court,
chrysler
argued
that
the
request
of
the
material
was
within
the
trade
secrets
exemption
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
that
therefore
the
government
agency
was
barred
from
disclosing
it
to
third
parties.
it
also
argued
that
disclosure
was
barred
by
a
criminal
statute,
title
18
united
states
code
section
1905
which
prohibits
the
release
of
trade
secrets
or
confidential
business
information
by
government
employees
if
such
disclosure
is
not
otherwise
in
the
words
of
that
statute
authorized
by
law.
the
district
court
held
that
the
exemption
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
do
not
bar
the
release
of
information
but
simply
give
the
government
agency
discretion
whether
or
not
to
release
material
within
the
terms
of
the
exemptions.
but
it
agreed
with
chrysler
that
the
disclosure
of
certain
requested
materials
was
barred
by
section
1905.
it
rejected
the
government's
argument
that
because
of
the
disclosure
of
the
information
was
pursuant
to
certain
federal
regulations,
the
discovery
was
therefore
“authorized
by
law
within
the
terms
of
section
1905.”
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
and
remanded.
it
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
the
exemptions
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
only
permit
withholding
information
did
not
require
it.
it
disagreed
however
on
the
question
whether
disclosure
pursuant
to
the
federal
regulations
was
authorized
by
law
for
purposes
of
1905.
it
concluded
that
the
regulations
in
question
had
the
force
and
effect
of
law.
today,
we
vacate
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
we
agree
with
both
courts
below
that
exemptions
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
do
not
require
agencies
to
withhold
information
within
the
terms
of
these
exemptions.
but
we
conclude
that
the
right
regulations
involved
in
this
case
are
substantively
and
procedurally
inadequate
to
provide
the
“authorization
by
law”
required
by
section
1905.
the
court
of
appeals
was
therefore
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
regulations
took
the
requested
material
out
from
under
the
provisions
of
section
1905.
although
the
court's
opinion
today
is
unanimous,
mr.
justice
marshall
has
also
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
