isn't
that
somewhat
unusual
when
the
district
court
is
presented
with
both
a
statutory
claim
and
a
constitutional
claim
for
it
to
decide
the
constitutional
claim
in
preference
to
the
statutory
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mukai,
are
we
as
free
in
dealing
with
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
to
consider
a
matter
that
was
not
passed
on
by
a
three-judge
district
court
as
we
would
be
of
considering
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
that's
a
constitutional
argument
(voice
overlap)
is
that
a
constitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
lack
of
procedural
due
process.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
general
motors
and
your
client,
general
motors
and
the
new
franchise
did
have
an
agreement
to
open
up
at
particular
place,
but
it's
zoned
residentially?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
it
were?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can
get
an
immediate
injunction,
can't
you?
in
most
states,
if
a
person
simply
opens
up
and
use
that
is
not
permitted
under
the
zoning
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
a
state
court?
