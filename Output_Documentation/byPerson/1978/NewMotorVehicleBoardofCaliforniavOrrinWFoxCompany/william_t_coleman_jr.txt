mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
here
is
whether
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
a
state
may
grant
private
individuals
the
unrestrained
use
of
state
power
to
exclude
selectively
other
private
individuals
from
enjoying
the
common
occupations
of
life
for
substantial
periods
of
time.
such
a
grant
of
state
power
to
private
individuals
ought
to
be
particularly
suspect
since
once
exercise
whether
individually
or
collectively
it
results
in
a
horizontally
imposed
restraint
on
trade
long
held
per
se
legal
under
the
sherman
antitrust
law.
now,
let
me
make
crystal
clear
that
appellants
do
not
challenge
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
business
activities
within
its
boarders
through
active
state
supervision.
what
it
does
challenge
is
the
ability
of
an
existing
franchise
dealer
to
use
state
power
selectively,
arbitrarily,
and
capriciously
to
prevent
other
equally
competent
and
qualified
franchise
dealers
from
enjoying
their
franchise.
the
existing
franchise
dealers
can
do
this
because
the
state
issues
even
though
the
statute
is
a
for
core
statute,
a
temporary
injunction
in
favor
of
the
existing
dealer
without
any
notice,
any
hearing
or
even
the
slightest
consideration
by
any
state
official.
such
a
total
avocation
of
state
power
to
private
individuals
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
matter.
it's
not
only
unreasonable,
i
really
submit
it's
outrageous.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
so,
the
state
could
not
do
it
in
this
matter
where
they
put
in
the
hands
of
private
individual
the
uncontrolled
power
to
keep
another
person
out
of
business.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
if
what
you're
saying
your
honor,
i
think
you'd
have
a
different
question.
if
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
state
would
determine
that
in
california
for
example,
there
was
sufficient
number
of
business
dealers
and
we're
not
going
to
let
any
other
business
dealer
in.
i
think
you
had
a
completely
different
question
there,
but
what
we
claim
here
is
the
particular
wrong
is
the
state
advocated
its
power
and
instead
says,we'll
do
nothing,
but
if
any
private
competitor,
the
one
person
that
has
an
interest
adverse
to
the
interest
of
the
other
person
objects,
you
then
have
this
injunction
issue.
in
other
words,
i'd
like
to
say
here,
this
ought
to
be
clear,
under
this
statute,
once
general
motors
entered
into
the
franchise
agreement
with
miller
and
fox
and
each
of
them
already
had
a
state
license,
at
that
point,
under
this
statute
the
state
was
powerless
to
do
anything.
in
the
first
place,
if
the
franchise
was
set
more
than
ten
miles,
not
in
the
314
mile
area,
no
one
could
do
anything,
if
it
were
within
the
area
as
you
pointed
out
justice
stevens,
and
no
one
objects
it,
my
clients
had
an
absolute
right
to
open
and
it's
only
because
there's
somebody
in
that
area
which
i
think
everyone
here
has
to
agree
has
to
be
the
one
person
that
i
cannot
depend
upon
to
give
me
a
fair,
unbiased
determination
as
to
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
the
statute.
that's
the
one
person
that
can
prevent
me
from
going
ahead
with
the
fruits
of
my
contract
and
that's
why
i
think
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
lack
of
procedural
process
and
a
state
--
number
one,
number
two,
a
state
statue
which
gives
private
individuals
the
uncontrolled
right
to
affect
my
liberty
and
that
strictly
the
richmond,
the
eubank
versus
richmond
case,
your
honor,
where
the
court
said
there
that
you
can't
have
a
statute
which
says
that
the
landowners,
if
two-thirds
of
them
decide
where
the
property
line
should
be,
that
ends
the
matter
and
that's
where
you
put
the
property
on.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
sir
we
don't
have
that
problem
here
because
in
this
case
the
places
which
was
selected
were
already
used
as
automobile
places.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
that's,
if
you
had
a
general
law,
a
general
law
applicable
to
everybody,
not
a
law
where
only
and
only
my
competitor
can
bring
it
into
force
and
a
law
where
when
he
brings
it
into
force
prior
to
any
state
hearing,
he
gets
all
the
relief
that
he's
trying
to
get
and
that's
what
the
wrong
here.
if
what
you're
saying
is
can
you
have
a
general
statute,
regulatory
statute
saying
that
in
a
particular
area,
if
you
don't
--
if
it
doesn't
qualify
that
there
can
be
a
hearing
or
you
can
object
and
the
state
independently
determines
i
will
or
i
will
not,
that's
completely
the
difference.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
sir,
based
upon
the
wisdom
of
your
own
rules,
you
don't
get
immediate
injunctions
in
the
federal
court.
what
you
do
is
you
file
a
piece
of
paper,
you
file
a
pleading,
you
have
an
affidavit
and
then
the
most
independent
person
of
all,
a
federal
district
judge
passes
upon
that
and
i've
won
some
and
i've
lost
some,
your
honor.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i'm
pretty
sure
that
if
any
state
court
raises
judge
--
justice
white
opinion
in
the
north
georgia
finishing
company
case,
i
think
that
a
state
court
ought
to
be
constitutionally
under
the
same
restriction.
that's
what
the
whole
line
of
fuentes
case
is
about
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
that's
a
different
case
if
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
it
were
a
statute
on
which
before
the
state
powers
exercise
that
we
obtain
a
hearing,
then
obviously
we
could
no
longer
argue
the
due
process
issue.
we
may
have
other
issues
in
the
case,
but
we
wouldn't
have
to
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right,
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
a
more
difficult
case.
i
think
that
what
usually
happens
--
i
think
that
the
statute
ought
to
read
that
a
state
independently
or
upon
objections.
i
mean,
you
know,
for
example
when
most
statute
say
that
if
you
file
and
someone
had
standing
of
due
cause
makes
an
objection
or
the
state
independently
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
wrong
of
this
statute
is
the
state
independently
can
never
act
and
it
could
only
act
if
a
competitor
comes
on.
i
think
that
it's
clear
in
this
case,
since
there
is
no
hearing
that
under
your
cases
of
the
court
that
the
statute
is
clearly
unconstitutional.
if
you
say
there
is
a
hearing,
then
obviously
you
don't
have
the
constitutional
issue
but
you
might
have
other
issues
if
you
say
that
there
will
only
be
a
hearing
if
a
competitor
is
the
one
that
asked
for
the
hearing.
i
just
think
that's
a
different
case.
with
respect
to
fox,
the
record
is
clear
that
fox
had
a
franchise
agreement,
he
had
a
license.
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
to
add
another
line
to
the
place,
his
place
of
business.
it's
equally
clear
that
under
state
law,
having
a
license,
his
only
duty
was
to
indicate
to
the
state
official
where
the
location
was
going
to
be.
at
that
point,
the
state
gave
him
an
entitlement.
he
had
the
right
to
go
forward
and
the
only
thing
that
prevented
him
from
going
forward
was
this
particular
statute
enacted
lately
which
said,
oh
wait,
if
a
competitor
objects,
you
can't
go
forward.
he
doesn't
have
to
give
me
any
reason
whatsoever.
all
he
does
is
file
and
if
you
look
at
the
record
on
page
77,
you
will
see
the
objection.
it
just
says,
i
object
and
based
upon
that,
fox
was
held
up
for
over
11
months.
he
lost
the
entire
season
of
sale
and
we
think
that's
what's
wrong
with
this
statute.
i
think
i
made
it
clear
as
to
what
i
think
the
liberty
interest
is.
i
think
that
every
american
citizen
has
an
absolute
right
to
go
into
business
and
he
or
she
cannot
be
interfered
with
except
under
a
state
statute
which
either
regulates
somebody
generally
applying
to
everyone
or
one
which
first
applies
for
a
type
of
hearing.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
among
ten
or
12
others
it's
been
cited
on
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
you've
made
the
point
i've
been
trying
to
make
dramatically
about
the
(inaudible).
but
with
all
due
respect,
well,
justice
rehnquist
sometime
said
that
because
after
meyers,
a
statute
permits
a
certain
type
of
substantive
regulation,
that
means
that
meyers
has
been
overruled,
there's
no
liberal
interest,
it
doesn't.
it
just
means
that
there's
still
the
liberty
interest
but
the
court
will
permit
state
action
to
affect
that.
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
one
way
you
can
affect
it
in
this
type
of
statute
applying
only
to
competitor
is
without
requiring
a
hearing.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right,
we
used
meyers
only
to
establish
that
we
have
a
liberty(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right
for
one,
because
the
person
had
a
liberty
interest
and
we
say
that
once
you
recognize
that
a
liberty
interest
then
they
can't
do
what
they
wanted
to
do
here
without
a
certain
type
of
hearing.
we
also
say
we
have
an
entitlement
in
justice
powell
in
his
opinion
in
the
kennedy
case
on
that
kennedy
and
once
again
says
that
once
you
establish
either
by
the
constitution
or
by
statute
that
you
have
an
entitlement
and
justice
brennan,
you,
in
the
goldberg
case,
once
you
establish
that,
then
you
have
the
right
to
say
that
the
state
cannot
affect
that
without
granting
me
a
hearing.
and
even
though
justice
rehnquist
would
say
and
i
think
erroneously,
that
at
that
state,
if
the
same
statute
like
in
arnett
says
but
our
hearings
are
different
type
of
hearing
that
somehow
you
read
that
back
in
the
cut
down
on
the
liberty
or
entitlement
interest.
fortunately
for
me,
six
members
of
this
court
have
held
to
the
contrary
and
i
think
for
that
reason
that
my
cycle
fits
you
that
there
is
this
liberty
interest.
then
you
have
to
determine,
can
this
type
of
interest
be
taken
away
by
a
competitor
without
a
hearing
once
i
demonstrate
that
there
is
an
entitlement
under
the
license
that
i
demonstrate
to
you
that
here
the
state
license
gave
my
clients
and
including
general
motors
this
right.
can
that
right
be
affected
not
by
the
state
acting
independently
but
by
private
competitor
without
first
getting
a
hearing?
i
don't
think
i
have
to
argue
the
question
of
the
hearing
because
here
there
was
no
hearing
at
all.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
i
think
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
--
there'd
be
a
different
problem.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
my
argument
would
not
go
to
that
and
i
must
be
--
because
i'm
affected
greatly
by
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
the
bell
versus
burson
case.
in
the
first
paragraph
of
that
opinion
said,
if
you
have
a
state
statute
which
said
that
anybody
that
wanted
to
drive
a
car
had
to
have
automobile
insurance,
that
that
statute
would
probably
be
constitutional,
but
if
the
state
statute
doesn't
do
that
and
say
that
if
you
drive
and
you
don't
have
insurance
that
if
you're
there
and
get
into
an
accident
and
if
you
don't
pay
up
in
a
certain
time
and
therefore,
it's
at
fault
that
we're
going
to
keep
you
from
enjoying
this
license.
then
under
those
circumstances,
you
first
have
to
have
some
type
of
hearing,
so
we
would
have
to
say
here
that
obviously,
if
you
drew
a
different
statute,
we'd
have
a
different
problem,
but
we
think
under
this
statute
you
don't
have
that
type
of
problem
and
it's
clear
that
the
state
isn't
thinking
about
barring
all
the
automobile
dealers.
what
it
did
was
to
put
in
the
hands
of
the
competitor
this
type
of
action,
which
we
think
it's
clearly
unconstitutional.
now,
i
would
next
like
to
turn
to
the
antitrust
and
supremacy
argument.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
simply
because
under
those
facts
if
you
opened
up
and
a
dealer
within
that
area
doesn't
do
anything,
the
state
is
powerless
to
act.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
footnote
in
our
briefs
sir,
there
were
170
protest.
i
think
it's
about
page
33,
but
in
footnote
in
our
brief
sir,
there
were
170
protest
filed,
only
one
has
ever
been
sustained.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it's
a
record
of
my
good
friend,
one
of
the
parties
wrote
a
letter
and
said
--
it's
clear
there's
no
doubt
i
think.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
so
that
should
dramatically
show
to
you
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
it
certainly
does
and
if
you
just
look
at
it
why
should
it
be
that
if
there's
business
decision
that
there
should
be
additional
dealer
selling
buick,
this
statute
is
314
miles,
do
you
realize
that's
every
city
--
that
means
you
can
block
people
from
going
to
any
city
more
than
one
other
than
--
other
than
los
angeles
and
san
diego.
those
are
the
only
two
cities.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
the
state
--
(voice
overlap)
the
state
one
did
not
do
that
here
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
the
state
--
that's
a
completely
different
question
and
what
would
happen
here
is
(voice
overlap)
you
had
the
privilege
of
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what
i
would
say
is
whatever
my
rights
are,
they're
not
in
the
hands
of
my
private
competitor.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
they're
in
the
hands
of
a
public
official
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
sir,
when
you
were
in
the
justice
department,
you
had
matters
of
merger
sometimes
and
you
got
a
certain
time
to
act
but
if
people
could
come
into
you
and
say,
mr.
justice,
i
got
a
problem
we
want
to(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
what
i'm
saying,
i'm
saying
that
the
moment
it's
a
state
official,
i
as
a
citizen
have
the
right
to
go
to
that
state
official
to
explain
to
him--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
that's
a
completely
different
case
and
if
i
could
show
that
he
was
acting
arbitrarily
or
something
i'd
have
a
different
problem
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir
i
do.
i
think
that's
what
the
richmond
case
holds,
i
think.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
what
really
happened
was
that
that
your
decisions
developed
that
way
even
before
you
got
to
the
due
process.
the
due
process
is
an
additional
reason.
i
mean
that's
two
separate,
that's
why
we
mentioned
the
richmond
case,
your
honor,
because
long
before
you
got
to
this
later
due
process,
the
court
already
recognized
that
this
was
improper,
but
then
you
add
to
the
private
the
fact
that
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
but
no
sir.
i
don't
--
i
think
even
that's
acceptable
i
don't
have
to
--
if
the
state
statute
goes
on
and
says,
but
i
as
a
state
have
no
concern
in
this.
but
i
would
only
get
concern
if
a
private
competitor
who's
within
a
certain
area
files
a
paper.
i
think
that's
a
completely
different
case.
that's
what
the
wrong
is
to
trigger
here
particularly
when
they
already
have
a
license.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
because
i
think
that
there,
what
the
state
has
done
is
to
say
that
we're
not
going
to
decide
this
legislatively.
we're
going
to
decide
this
in
a
judicatory
proceeding,
and
once
you
have
a
judicatory
proceeding,
which
is
based
upon
fault,
then
you
have
the
rules
of
the
game
which
says
that
you
don't
affect
a
person's
right
without
first
giving
him
some
type
of
hearing.
incidentally
that
footnote
is
on
page
10
of
the
brief,
i
apologize.
i
next
would
like
to
turn
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
a
completely
different
statute
and
if
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
the
state
had
said
that
before
anybody
who's
going
to
business,
you
have
to
file
a
piece
of
paper
with
the
state
and
the
state
for
a
certain
period
of
time
will
suspend
any
hearing
on
that
to
develop
the
proper
type
of
evidence
then
obviously
because
we
live
in
an
organized
society
where
it
takes
time
to
decide
something.
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
recognize
that
public
officials
can't
act
the
next
day.
certainly,
justice
white,
you're
talking
about
a
statute
of
general
application
and
i
think
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
i
mean
this
kind
of
cases
make
it
quite
different.
you're
talking
about
generally
where
you
affect
it
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
but
that's
not
the
statute.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that
statute
would
raise
other
problems.
it
wouldn't
raise
the
problems
that
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i'd
have
to
read
the
statue
first,
there
you
don't
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
today,
the
reason
why
i'm
not
being
more
forthcoming
to
you
than
i
normally
would
be
sir,
i've
had
experience
to
this
fear,
you
just
don't
get
statutes
drawn
that
simply.
and
i
have
to
read
the
statute
and
i
don't
want
anybody
to
say
that
i've
concede
that
any
statute
here
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right,
i
would
say
that's
a
different
case.
and
maybe
gm
will
get
a
different
lawyer
to
argue
that
one,
but
this
particular
one
that's
not
my
problem
and
i
think
that's
a
completely
different
case.
as
i
said
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
antitrust
consistency
argument.
gm
entered
into
an
agreement
with
fox
to
sell
buick.
after
reviewing
the
facts
and
making
a
determination
that
the
pasadena
location
would
comply
with
section
3063
of
the
act,
but
two
competing
dealers
who
also
have
gm
agreements
jointly
protested.
the
act
inferred
upon
them
the
power
without
any
independent
state
decision
to
prevent
fox
as
a
competing
dealer
from
locating
in
the
territory
because
it
is
within
the
314-mile
area
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
when
you
indicated
that
there
was
an
empire
planned.
that
has
been
changed
and
it
was
changed
because
of
in
part
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
in
the
holiday
inn
case
and
gm
felt
that
perhaps
it
might
be
a
problem
if
you
would
permit
some
of
the
existing
dealers
to
object
to
a
new
dealer
coming
in.
and
so
therefore,
with
respect
to
this
type
of
decision,
there
is
not
an
empire
plan,
but
that
is
the
reason
why
it
seems
that
this
statute
has
to
be
bad
because
if
you
say
that
gm
with
its
dealers
cannot
make
this
type
of
arrangement,
then
clearly,
a
competing
dealer
merely
by
saying,
i
protest
ought
not
for
a
period
from
90
days
to
a
year-and-a-half
be
able
to
impose
what
is
basically
a
horizontal
trade
restraint.
as
i
understand
the
law,
the
sherman
act
says
that
any
statute,
state
statute
which
permits
a
private
competitor
to
do
this
is
invalid.
that's
what
i
think
your
decision
in
schwegmann
says,
in
schwegmann,
the
liquid
distributor
had
a
valid
contract
for
retail
price
maintenance
with
some
local
retailers.
the
louisiana
statute,
however,
attempted
to
arm
the
private
competitor
with
the
ability
to
extend
this
contract
by
making
such
price
fixing
enforceable
against
non-signing
retailers.
because
this
extension
conflicted
with
basic
antitrust
principle,
the
louisiana
statute
was
preempted
by
the
sherman
act.
in
schwegmann,
this
court
never
inquired
into
whether
any
private
individual
had
violated
the
antitrust
law.
for
all
higher
value
imposed
restrictions
to
restrain
trade
are
patently
pernicious
and
are
per
se
violations
of
the
federal
antitrust
law.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
what
you
do
sir
is
the
same
way
with
schwegmann.
the
fact
is
that
you
have
a
state
statute
which
permits
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
sir,
what
you
have
here,
you
have
a
state
statute
which
permits
an
individual
to
bring
about
the
same
type
of
conduct
that
normally
he
could
only
bring
about
by
way
of
an
agreement.
you
know
suppose
you
had
a
state
statute
which
says
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right
because
it
permits
a
private
individual
acting
by
himself
to
bring
about
exactly
the
same
result
that
otherwise
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i
would
ask
you
to
reread
schwegmann
because
i
think
that
schwegmann
does
not
depend
upon
any
agreement,
which
is
anyway
has
determined
to
be
illegal
or
improper.
what
schwegmann
says
is
that
you
can't
use
the
state
power
to
bring
about
exactly
the
same
result
that
otherwise
you
can
bring
about
only
by
an
agreement.
and
i
think
that
the
only
thing
that
would
save
the
statute
would
be
the
so-called
parker
doctrine,
but
if
there's
is
anything
clear
from
cannor
and
your
case
is
decided
in
less
two
or
three
years
is
that
the
state
has
to
do
something
in
terms
of
act
of
supervision
before
you
say
the
parker
doctrine
is
applicable
and
here
there
is
no
act
of
supervision
whatsoever.
i
didn't
think
i
was
going
to
get
this
far
without
justice
white
asking
me
about
the
question
he
asked
the
other
day
about
this
question
of
whether
since
we
raised
both
issues
below
and
now
the
court
passed
upon
one
constitutional
issue.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
think
under
the
cases,
i
think
the
case
that
you
were
referring
to
was
hogan
versus
lathen
and
as
i
read
that
case
or
somebody
read
it
for
me
last
night
then
i
read
it
this
morning.
that
case
says
that
both
issue
with
constitutional
issues
also
what
we're
asking
here
is
only
what
the
court
did
in
ohio
bureau
of
employment
versus
hodory,
which
is
431
u.s.
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
dont
think
that's
what
you
said,
you
said
--
but
if
they
don't
reach
that
first
and
they
decide
the
other
issue,
both
would
never
both
submit
it
and
here
they're
both
constitutional
issues
which
in
hagen
you
indicated
that
there's
not
--
and
we
submitted
both
of
them.
and
we
argued
both
of
them
equally
as
vigorously.
now,
if
the
court
says
as
i
look
at
the
constitutional
cases
dealing
with
the
due
process,
that's
so
clear
that
our
resolve
on
that
phase
is
they
give
us
the
injunction
and
i
don't
see
it
how
we
can
do
anything
else
but
accept
it
and
wait
hoping
that
nobody
would
take
it
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
sir,
i
think
that
you
should
resolve
it
here.
i
think
that
the
facts
are
clear,
the
argument
is
clear
and
in
my
understanding
is
that
what
you
did
in
ohio
bureau
of
employment
versus
hodory
and
also,
sterling
versus
constantin,
thank
you
sir.
