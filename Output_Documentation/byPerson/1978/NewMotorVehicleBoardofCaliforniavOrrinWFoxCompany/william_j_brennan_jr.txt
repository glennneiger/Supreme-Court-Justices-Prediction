justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
let's
see,
does
that
mean
only
a
pontiac
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
chevrolet
couldn't
protest
the
relocation
of
pontiac,
it
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
that
question
(regarding
state's
supervision,
you
said
it's
just
like
these
other
cases
where
the
parker
against
brown
exception
is
going
to
apply.
but
here
what
kind
of
state
--
what
the
does
the
state
do
other
than
to
say
that
the
nearby
dealer
shall
be
protected
from
competition?
that's
all
its
says,
isn't
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
it's
just
a
yes
or
no
situation,
either
the
new
dealership
can
open
or
it
can't.
there
is
no
continuing
regulatory
supervision
of
any
kind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
sole
state
interest
is
in
protecting
the
old
dealer
from
additional
competition
by
a
new
dealer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
prevent
too
much
competition
is
another
way,
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
describe
this
as
protecting
consumers,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
nothing
in
our
opinion
suggest
that
the
state
of
maryland
law
did
anything
for
the
consumer
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
rely
for
your
basic
constitutional
liberty
upon
cases
such
as
meyer
against
nebraska,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
12
others,
so
in
that
case
that
the
three-judge
court
particularly
relied
upon.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
that
all
the
hearings
in
the
world
wouldn't
have
made
that
statute
valid.
that
wasn't
a
procedural
due
process.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
meyer
case
and
that
line
of
cases
pierce
against
the
society
of
sisters
and
so
on,
doesn't
--
those
are
not
procedural
due
process
case,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
those
cases
held
that
the
state
couldn't
do
what
it
did
at
all,
with
all
the
hearings
in
the
world,
it
still
couldn't
do
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
central
district
of
california
declaring
unconstitutional
the
california
automobile
franchise
act.
under
that
act,
a
motor
vehicle
manufacturer
must
secure
the
approval
of
the
california
new
motor
vehicle
board
before
opening
a
retail
motor
vehicle
dealership
within
the
market
area
of
an
existing
franchisee
but
if
and
only
if
that
existing
franchisee
protests
the
establishment
of
the
competing
dealership.
the
act
also
directs
the
board
to
notify
the
manufacturer
of
this
statutory
requirement
upon
the
filing
of
a
timely
protest
by
an
existing
franchisee.
appellee,
general
motors
corporation
manufactures
buick
and
chevrolet
cars
among
many
others
and
appellee
fox
signed
a
franchise
agreement
with
general
motors
in
may
1975
to
establish
a
new
buick
dealership
in
pasadena.
appellee,
muller
chevrolet
agreed
with
general
motors
to
transfer
its
existing
chevrolet
franchise
from
a
glendale
to
la
canada,
california
in
december
of
1975.
in
the
proposed
establishment
of
fox
and
relocation
of
muller,
were
protested
respectively
by
existing
buick
and
chevrolet
dealerships.
the
new
motor
vehicle
board
responded
as
required
by
the
franchise
act
by
notifying
appellees
that
protests
had
been
filed
and
that
therefore
general
motors
and
the
other
appellees
were
not
to
establish
or
relocate
the
dealerships
and
though
the
board
had
held
the
hearings
required
by
the
act
nor
thereafter
if
the
board
determined
that
there
was
good
cause
for
not
permitting
these
new
dealerships.
and
the
board
is
not
required
by
the
statute
to
hold
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
dealer
protest
before
sending
the
manufacturer
such
a
notice
and
in
this
case
no
prior
hearing
was
held.
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
absence
of
such
a
prior
hearing
requirement
denied
general
motors
and
their
potential
franchisees
procedural
due
process
mandated
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
disagree
and
we
reverse.
even
if
the
right
to
franchise
constituted
an
interest
protected
by
due
process,
the
california
legislature
was
still
at
least
since
the
demise
of
the
concept
of
substantive
due
process
as
an
inhibitor
on
economic
regulation
constitutionally
empowered
to
enact
a
general
scheme
of
business
regulation
that
imposed
reasonable
regulations
upon
the
exercise
of
the
right.
in
particular
the
california
legislature
was
empowered
to
subordinate
general
motors'
franchise
rights
to
their
franchisees'
conflicting
rights
were
necessary
to
prevent
unfair
or
oppressive
trade
practices
and
also
to
protect
franchisees'
conflicting
rights
through
customary
and
reasonable
procedural
safeguards,
that
is
as
here
by
providing
existing
dealers
with
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
an
impartial
tribunal
before
general
motors
is
permitted
to
inflict
upon
them
grievous
loss.
such
procedural
safeguards
can't
be
said
to
deprive
general
motors
of
due
process.
now,
there's
another
issue
of
suggested
conflict
with
the
sherman
act
which
the
district
court
did
not
reach
because
of
the
ground
it
took
in
invalidating
the
statute
ordinarily
that
we
might
send
that
back
for
the
district
court
to
consider
it
but
because
it's
only
a
question
of
law,
we
have
decided
it.
and
we
hold
there
is
no
conflict
with
the
sherman
act.
the
statutory
scheme
is
a
system
of
regulation
designed
to
displace
unfettered
business
freedom
in
establishing
and
relocating
automobile
dealerships
and
hence
it's
outside
the
reach
of
the
antitrust
laws
under
the
state
action
exemption
of
parker
and
brown.
moreover,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
conflict
with
the
sherman
act
because
the
act
does
permit
dealers
to
invoke
state
powers
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
intraband
competition,
that
conflict
cannot
itself
constitute
a
sufficient
reason
for
invalidating
the
statute
for
if
an
adverse
effect
on
competition
were
in
and
of
itself
enough
to
render
a
state
statute
invalid,
the
state's
power
to
engage
in
economic
regulation
would
be
effectively
destroyed.
