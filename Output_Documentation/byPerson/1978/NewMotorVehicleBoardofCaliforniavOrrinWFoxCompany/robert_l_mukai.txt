mr.
robert
l.
mukai
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
state
must
provide
commercial
enterprises
subject
to
it's
state
regulatory
capacity,
a
hearing
prior
to
obliging
those
enterprises
to
delay
consummation
of
certain
commercial
expectancies
pending
a
state
inquiry
in
the
regulatory
interest.
and
this
case
arises
from
a
partial
summary
judgment
entered
in
the
central
district
of
california,
declaring
facially
void
and
enjoining
enforcement
of
a
motor
vehicle
dealership
establishment
and
relocation
act
of
the
state,
which
i
shall
refer
to
as
the
california
automobile
franchise
act.
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
holds
that
the
act
deprives
franchisors
and
their
business
associates
of
liberty
and
property
without
due
process
of
law.
now,
your
honors,
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
propose
to
focus
my
remarks
principally
upon
the
basic
reason
that
we
contend
the
district
court
ought
not
to
decided
this
case
at
all.
and
further,
i
propose,
with
the
court's
permission,
to
defer
to
counsel
for
appellants
in
number
849,
the
discussion
of
the
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance
which
have
been
urged
by
the
appellees.
i'd
like
to
spend
a
few
moments
with
the
statute
in
question,
that
statute
in
section
3062
of
the
california
vehicle
code
provides
that
in
the
event
that
a
franchisor
seeks
to
establish
or
relocate
a
dealership
within
10
miles
of
one
of
its
existing
dealerships,
then
the
franchisor
must
first
notify
the
new
motor
vehicle
board
of
the
state,
an
administrative
agency,
and
each
of
the
franchisors’
existing
franchisees
in
the
same
line-make,
within
10
miles
of
the
prospective
dealership
site.
any
franchisee,
so
notified,
who
is
located
within
10
miles
of
the
proposed
site
may
then
file
a
protest
with
the
new
motor
vehicle
board
within
15
days.
when
a
protest
has
been
filed,
the
franchisor
is
prohibited
from
effectuating
the
proposed
establishment
or
relocation
until
a
hearing
has
been
held
by
the
board.
the
california
vehicle
code
section
3062
implements
this
prohibition
by
requiring
the
board,
upon
the
receipt
of
a
protest,
to
notify
the
franchisor
first
that
a
timely
protest
has
in
fact
been
filed,
second,
that
a
hearing
is
required
to
be
held
by
the
board
and
third,
that
the
franchisor
shall
not
establish
or
relocate
the
proposed
dealership
until
such
time
as
the
requisite
hearing
has
been
held,
nor
following
the
hearing
if
the
board
should
determine
that
cause
exists
not
to
permit
the
dealership.
and
the
board
notifications
that
were
issued
to
general
motors
franchising
divisions
in
this
case
are
found
at
pages
52
and
80
of
the
joint
appendix.
i
should
add
that
the
act
does
require
a
full
evidentiary
hearing
within
60
days
after
a
notice
of
hearing
has
been
issued
by
the
board.
and
as
the
district
court
itself
noted,
if
the
board
itself
hears
the
protest,
it
must
issue
its
decision
within
30
days
after
holding
the
hearing
or
else
the
franchisor’s
proposed
action
for
establishment
or
relocation
is
deemed
approved
by
law.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
your
honor,
in
the
event
that
no
protest
is
filed,
there
is
no
further
step
to
be
taken
by
the
board
as
an
administrative
agency
and
the
franchisor
is
permitted
to
go
ahead
with
its
plans.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
if
a
protest
is
withdrawn
prior
to
the
hearing,
the
board
issues
a
notice
of
dismissal
of
the
protest
and
the
franchisor
is
permitted
to
consummate
its
plans.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
not
exactly
your
honor.
the
act
utilizes
the
protest
as
the
means
for
bringing
the
public
interest
to
issue
before
the
new
motor
vehicle
board
and
in
this
respect,
the
california
--
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
the
board
has
in
the
past
taken
the
position
that
although
a
protest
maybe
withdrawn,
the
board
is
not
automatically
deprived
of
jurisdiction
to
regulate.
the
order
of
dismissal
ordinarily
issues
following
the
withdrawal
of
the
protest,
but
it's
not
required
by
law
to
so
issue.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
under
the
california
statute,
any
dealer
in
the
same
line-make
as
the
proposed
dealership
to
be
established
or
relocated.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
that
is
true,
your
honor.
however,
members
of
the
public
may
appear
at
the
hearing
and
be
represented
and
produce
evidence
and
be
heard
fully
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
prescribed
by
section
3066
of
the
vehicle
code.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
no
your
honor,
that
could
not
happen
under
the
act.
only
an
intra-brand
situation
exists
here,
only
a
competitor
in
the
same
line-make
can
protest.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
only
a
pontiac
automobile
dealer.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
that
is
correct
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
that
is
possible,
your
honor
to
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
that
could
certainly
be
one
basis.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
it
borders
on
the
zoning
matter
in
many
instances
your
honor,
but
the
state’s
interest
in
this
form
of
regulation
can
take
on
many
different
aspects.
there
could
conceivably
be
a
situation
where
disinterested
in
the
sense
of
purely
private
individuals
could
take
an
interest
in
the
number
or
the
location,
perhaps
the
location
of
--
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
your
honor,
i
can't
answer
that.
i'm
simply
unaware
of
whether
any
citizens
have
ever
appeared
in
these
kinds
of
proceedings.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
yes,
your
honor,
it
could.
i'm
certainly
--
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
virtually,
any
other
business,
i
am
sure
your
honor,
based
upon
among
other
things
this
court's
decision,
clarifying
decision
on
exxon
corporation
against
governor
of
maryland.
your
honors,
the
district
court
interpreted
the
act
as
requiring
the
board
to
set
a
hearing
date
concurrent
with
its
issuance
of
the
statutory
notification
to
the
franchisor.
but
even
though
under
this
interpretation,
the
period
of
delay
between
invocation
of
the
statute’s
prohibition
and
the
time
of
a
final
decision
on
the
merits,
is
potentially
as
short
as
90
days.
the
court
held
that
the
act's
failure
to
provide
a
hearing
before
imposing
any
delay
or
to
require
a
hearing
soon
thereafter
constituted
a
deprivation
of
liberty
on
property
without
due
process
of
law.
in
the
district
court,
we
cited
the
chief
justice’s
dissenting
opinion
in
the
1971
case
of
wisconsin
versus
constantino.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
that
is
exactly
what
judge
ely
said
to
me
your
honor,
but
we
cited
it
because
we
believe
that
that
dissent
which
was
concurred
in
by
mr.
justice
blackmun,
has
now
become
the
role
for
application
of
pullman
abstention
through
this
court's
more
recent
decisions
in
harris
county
commissioner's
court
against
moore
decided
in
1975
and
the
1976
decision
in
bellotti
against
baird
which
was
decided
unanimously
by
this
court.
and
that
rule
we
submit
is
that
the
pullman
doctrine
applies
even
to
an
unambiguous
statute
which
appears
to
be
in
conflict
with
accepted
notions
of
due
process
if
it
is
susceptible
of
a
state
court
ruling
which
would
either
avoid
a
necessity
of
a
federal
constitutional
decision
or
in
the
alternative
substantially
modify
the
federal
issue
involved.
in
the
present
case
entirely
apart
from
the
suggestion
that
the
california
court
could
invalidate
the
act
under
the
state
constitution,
we
have
submitted
that
this
statute
is
susceptible
of
at
least
two
constructions,
one
of
which
would
avoid
federal
constitutional
issue
and
the
other
of
which
would
substantially
modify
it.
first,
as
was
the
case
in
constantino,
this
act
could
be
construed
to
require
a
hearing
before
a
state
action
occurs
at
all.
this
california
precedent
for
such
a
situation
we've
cited
to
the
court,
the
case
of
endler
against
schutzbank
involving
a
real
estate
commissioner's
case
in
california
and
rios
versus
cousins
heard
in
this
court’s
sub
nom,
department
to
motor
vehicles
against
rios.
appellees
point
out
in
their
brief
that
we
have
never
affirmatively
advocated
this
construction
and
of
course
this
is
true
because
we
do
not
believe
that
the
act
interferes
with
the
liberty
or
a
property
interest
and
because
we
do
not
believe
that
due
process
requires
a
prior
hearing
even
if
some
such
interest
is
involve
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
yes,
your
honor,
as
we
understand
--
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
as
we
understand
the
appellants
in
the
consolidated
appeal,
they
believe
that
this
statute
is
totally
unambiguous.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
that
is
my
understanding,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i
feel
that
it's
important
that
i
bring
at
least
one
ambiguity
to
this
court's
attention.
and
that
is
the
second
interpretation
which
we
have
advocated
affirmatively
and
it's
the
interpretation
of
which
would
substantially
modify
the
due
process
issue
dealt
with
by
the
district
court.
that
interpretation
would
hold
that
the
act
requires
the
manufacturer
to
provide
notice
to
the
board
and
to
its
franchisees
before
its
commitment
to
its
plans
has
advanced
so
far
that
the
manufacturer
simply
cannot
bear
the
delays
of
state
regulation.
this
interpretation
focuses
on
the
first
words
of
vehicle
code
section
3062
which
is
the
crux
of
this
case.
those
words
are,
“in
the
event
that
a
franchisor
seeks
to
enter
into
a
franchise,
establishing
an
additional
dealership
or
relocating
an
existing
dealership.
the
interpretation
which
we
have
advocated
would
settle
the
time
related
ambiguity
of
these
first
words
present
and
the
necessity
of
such
an
interpretation
is
demonstrated
by
the
facts
that
the
fox
enfranchisement
and
the
muller
relocation
in
this
very
case,
presented
situations
where
in
neither
case
did
general
motors’
notice
of
intent
precede
finalization
of
its
plans
with
those
dealers
and
in
both
cases,
general
motors
waited
to
give
notice
until
after
it
had
already
entered
into
the
franchises
with
its
respective
dealers.
in
fact,
in
the
case
of
fox,
general
motors
didn’t
give
notice
at
all
until
some
three
months
after
the
franchise
became
effective.
now,
appellee's
due
process
claim
rests
at
least
in
part
on
the
assertion
of
a
protected
property
right
by
virtue
of
contractual
arrangements
regarding
its
franchise.
if
a
state
court
were
to
interpret
this
section
to
require
the
manufacturer
to
issue
its
notice
at
sometime,
before
these
contractual
arrangements
are
made
and
finalized,
then
there
could
be
no
basis
whatsoever
for
the
due
process
claim
predicated
on
the
existence
of
contract.
in
addition,
if
some
liberty
or
property
interest
is
implicated
by
this
statute,
the
determinants
of
what
process
is
due
would
be
completely
different
because
of
the
nature
of
the
so-called
right
that
is
being
interfered
with,
because
in
that
situation
--
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
yes,
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
we
advocate
the
interpretation
that
this
is
what
the
statute
requires
your
honor
based
upon
the
language
in
the
event
that
and
seeks
to
enter
into.
i
think
the
language
is
clearly
anticipatory.
if
the
court
please,
i'll
reserve
any
remaining
time
i
may
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
close
of
court
yesterday
i
was
discussing
the
fact
that
the
private
conduct
which
is
authorized
by
the
california
statute
could
in
no
sense
be
considered
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
because
it
does
not
involve
conduct,
which
has
been
declared
illegal
under
the
antitrust
laws.
far
from
it,
the
conduct
is
protected
by
the
noerr-pennington
political
action
exception.
i
also
would
stress
that
the
act
itself,
even
if
it
did
authorize
conduct
which
was
not
political
action,
and
which
could
conceivably
be
held
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws
but
for
the
statute
itself
would
still
constitute
state
action
under
the
test.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
i
must
confess
some
ignorance
as
to
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
assume
that
is
the
case,
but
i
did
not
research
that
particular
point.
this
quickly
because
the
point
is
made
i
think
in
appellant's
replied
briefs.
under
the
standards
that
this
court
has
come
down
with
in
the
five
or
six
cases
really
in
the
last
four
or
five
years,
the
conduct
here
of
making
a
protest
to
the
board
would
be
clearly
authorized
by
a
state
statute
exhibiting
a
clear
intent
to
remove
this
operation
of
this
particular
industry
from
competition
and
therefore,
from
the
application
of
the
sherman
act
and
there
is
a
clear
intent
in
the
statute
to
substitute
state
regulation.
as
established
i
think
in
the
briefs
distinguishes
it
from
(inaudible)
of
cantor,
lafayette
power
and
the
schwegmann
case
of
1951.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
yes
i
do.
i
would
in
closing
like
to
make
several
general
comments
about
the
sherman
act
issue
here,
and
also
the
commerce
clause
issue
which
the
appellees
have
tendered
by
way
of
footnote.
i
think
that
as
far
as
the
preemption
issue
is
concerned
here,
appellee's
argument
has
an
alice
in
wonderland
quality
to
it.
you
have
a
statute
which
does
not
authorize
illegal
conduct
in
the
sherman
act
and
which
does
have
adequate
state
supervision.
to
extend
the
idea
of
--
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
well,
the
statute
provides
that
of
course
there
will
be
a
board
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
there'll
be
any
permanent
prohibition
of
putting
in
the
new
franchise.
the
state
also
controls
the
time
during
which
the
temporary
order
will
be
in
effect
because
the
board
can
hold
a
hearing
quickly
or
it
can
wait
the
full
60
days.
it
must
hold
the
hearing
within
60
days.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
that's
correct,
that's
correct,
there
is
no
continuance.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
i
would
phrase
it
slightly
differently.
i
think
it's
to
prevent
overloading
in
a
particular
--
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
that
might
deprive
consumers
of
warranty
facilities
through
business
failures
and
things
of
that
type,
yes.
that's
--
i
think
--
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
i
think
it
is
in
part
designed
for
that,
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
certainly,
to
the
same
extent
the
state
of
maryland's
law
was
in
the
xy
cases.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
that
didn't
seem
to
be
crucial
for
the
opinion,
no.
i
would
lastly
say
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
antitrust
laws
yoked
with
the
supremacy
clause
as
a
poor
vehicle
to
be
used
to
strike
down
statutes,
which
maybe
unpleasing
to
manufacturers.
essentially
gm
complains,
it's
a
bad
law,
and
they
don't
like
it.
i
think
that's
quite
questionable,
congress
and
other
state
legislators
have
passed
similar
laws
but
the
remedy
in
that
case
is
not
before
this
court.
it
is
before
the
state
legislators
and
the
automobile
manufacturers
lack
neither
the
sophistication
or
the
resources
to
get
an
adequate
hearing
in
state
legislatures.
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
we
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
l.
mukai
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
coleman
suggest
that
the
schwegmann
decision
relieves
the
appellees
of
the
necessity
of
demonstrating
at
least
some
conduct
violative
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
refer
to
page
386
of
that
decision
reported
in
341
u.s
in
which
justice
douglas
unequivocally
stated
that
the
scheme
their
question
would
be
illegal,
would
be
enjoined
and
would
draw
civil
and
criminal
penalties
and
that
no
court
would
enforce
it.
and
that
was
the
louisiana
statute
which
was
struck
down
by
this
court
in
schwegmann.
so
it
is
our
submission
that
schwegmann
cannot
relieve
the
appellees
of
stating
an
antitrust
claim
without
showing
the
predicate
facts
necessary
to
make
out
a
violation
of
some
federal
antitrust
statute.
with
the
court's
permission,
mr.
coleman
has
pointed
out
or
has
characterized
a
right
existing
in
appellees
which
depends
in
large
part
upon
the
view
that
the
license
granted
to
a
dealer
provides
him
with
some
unassailable
right
to
locate
wherever
he
wants.
in
effect,
mr.
coleman
posits
a
portable
property
interest
in
the
dealer
which
you
could
not
be
deprived
of
without
a
due
process
hearing.
well,
his
characterization
is
mistaken
because
a
fixed
geographical
location
is
integral
to
the
initial
issuance
and
the
continued
entitlement
to
a
dealer
license
under
california
law.
in
section
11712
of
the
california
vehicle
code,
the
department
of
motor
vehicles,
the
licensing
authority
is
prohibited
from
issuing
a
dealer
license
to
an
applicant
without
an
established
place
of
business.
section
11721
requires
the
automatic
cancellation
of
a
dealer
license
whenever
a
dealer
abandons
an
established
place
of
business.
section
11713
makes
it
a
violation
of
the
code
not
to
maintain
an
established
place
of
business
and
section
40000.11
makes
that
violation
a
misdemeanor
under
california
law.
your
honors,
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired
and
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
