justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
a
protest
is
filed
and
then
withdrawn
before
the
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
vindication
of
the
public
interest
depends
entirely
of
the
activity
of
the
protestor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
after
it's
at
issue,
the
protestor
can
take
it
--
can
withdraw?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mukai,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
this?
supposing
there's
an
existing
ford
dealership
at
a
given
location
and
general
motors
is
negotiating
with
that
dealer
to
become
a
chevrolet
dealer,
would
the
statute
apply
if
the
ford
dealer
switched
to
chevrolet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that
you
are
in
effect
saying
that
you
ask
the
statute
be
construed
that
before
negotiations
go
too
far,
general
motors
give
notice
to
ford
that
it's
soliciting
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
quite
right,
mr.
mccall?
isn't
that
correct
that
the
private
party
could
--
all
the
dealers
within
10
miles
of
the
new
location
could
agree
with
on
another
that
they
would
let
general
motors
open
the
new
dealership
provided
general
motors
pay
them
a
certain
amount
or
gave
them
some
consideration,
couldn’t
they,
without
any
state
involvement
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
it,
basically
what
the
act
does
is
give
any
dealer
within
the
10-mile
radius
the
right
to
say,
“you
cannot
open
the
dealership
without
paying
the
amount
of
money
involved
in
conducting
an
evidentiary
hearing
of
some
kind”
and
if
it
instead
of
doing
that,
the
dealer
said,
“well,
if
you
just
give
us
$5,000.00
a
piece,
you
go
ahead.
the
public
wouldn't
care
anyway,
would
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
admit
then
that
would
be
a
problem
with
the
anti
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
illegal
for
general
motors
to
adopt
the
policy
in
california
that
when
they
open
a
new
dealership,
they
give
notice
to
all
the
dealers
that
if
you
don’t
protest,
we'll
hand
you
$10,000.00,
they
send
out
a
notice
of
that
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
they
all
decide,
“well,
that’s
better
than
going
through
the
cost
of
hearing.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
policy
that
the
statute
is
vindicating,
isn't
it,
namely
protecting
those
dealers
from
excessive
competition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
more
than
$10,000.00,
they
would
say,
“well,
we
won’t
take
the
$10,000.00,
but
give
us
$15,000.00.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
coleman,
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case
as
i
understood
it,
held
that
i
think
quite
clearly
if
perhaps
implicitly
that
the
state
could
do
precisely
this
so
long
as
sufficient
procedural
due
process
was
afforded,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
your
opening
statement,
i
think
you
posed
the
question
as
whether
or
not
the
state
can
do
it
all
with
or
without
procedural
due
process.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can't
do
it
all
or
can't
do
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
coleman,
just
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
submission,
i
take
it
you
emphasize
the
absence
of
any
governmental
participation
prior
to
the
adverse
impact
on
the
liberty
interest
which
you
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
would
mean
that
your
argument
would
not
cast
any
doubt
on
the
validity
of
a
statute
which
flatly
prohibited
new
dealerships
within
a
10-mile
radius
of
old
dealerships
or
alternatively
a
statute
which
said
you
cannot
open
a
new
dealership
without
getting
permission
from
an
appropriate
licensing
agency
or
something
like
that
and
you'd
apply
it
to
a
state
agency
for
a
new
dealership.
justice
john
paul
stevens
either
those
would
be
safe
under
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
thinking
your
argument
wouldn't
be
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
question
if
i
may
before
you
do.
could
we
view
this
statute
as
the
equivalent
of
creating
a
legislative
or
statutory
presumption
that
every
new
dealership
within
ten
miles
of
an
old
dealership
is
contrary
to
state
policy
in
some
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
experience
under
the
statute
as
to
how
most
of
these
disputes
are
resolved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
matter
of
public
record
or
that's
in
the
record
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
say
the
experience
would
demonstrate
that
the
presumption
runs
the
other
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
coleman,
don't
you
have
a
problem
with
the
facts
that
here
if
there
is
an
agreement
between
the
existing
dealer
who
objects
and
the
general
motors.
the
agreement
is
one
which
permits
the
new
company
to
new
dealership
to
open.
the
existing
dealer
can
object
without
agreeing
with
anybody,
so
where
do
you
get
the
conspiracy
element
of
the
sherman
act
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
that
gave
affect
to
a
vertical
agreement
between
the
liquor
company
and
its
wholesaler
and
its
retailer.
there
was
an
underlying
agreement
there
which
you
don't
have
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
is
that
a
state
statute
replaces
the
conspiracy
element
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
any
case
has
so
held.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
schwegmann,
as
i
say
have
a
two-party
agreement
in
it.
