mr.
james
r.
mccall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
accurately
stated
our
position
in
reference
to
the
abstention
issue.
it
is
the
position
of
the
dealer
association
appellants
here
that
abstention
of
the
pullman
variety
is
an
equitable
doctrine
at
this
point.
it
serves
no
useful
purpose
to
say
that
district
court
should
have
abstained.
i
would
like
to
pass
momentarily
to
the
due
process
clause
attack
which
was
brought
on
the
statute
and
which
was
the
specific
ground
on
which
the
district
court
held
that
the
statute
was
facially
invalid.
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
conceivable
liberty
or
property
interest
which
can
be
made
out
by
general
motors
or
the
other
appellees.
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
that
they
assert
the
right
to
establish
an
automobile
franchise
or
to
become
a
franchise
dealer
whenever
they
want
and
wherever
they
want.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
liberty
or
property
concept
which
has
been
given
due
process
procedural
protection
by
this
court,
ever.
one
other
point
in
reference
to
the
due
process
clause,
and
that
is
that
the
appellees
in
their
brief
have
stated
that
if
the
due
process
procedural
protections
are
not
available
to
general
motors
in
fox
and
muller,
in
this
situation,
then
they
have
no
protection
whatsoever
under
the
due
process
clause.
that
seems
to
be
a
statement
which
is
hard
to
sustain.
clearly,
there's
a
notion
of
substantive
due
process
in
the
sense
that
all
state
regulation
of
economic
enterprises
as
well
as
other
enterprises
and
other
activity
must
be
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
end
of
government.
clearly,
we
submit
and
we
have
submitted
this
in
our
reply
brief,
this
kind
of
legislation
is
indeed
rationally
related
to
illegitimate
end
of
government.
the
automobile
dealers’
day
in
court
act
on
the
federal
level
is
an
express
recognition
by
congress
of
the
inadequate
status
at
the
bargaining
table,
if
you
will,
which
dealers
have
when
they
bargain
with
automobile
manufacturers.
the
problem
of
overloading
in
terms
of
putting
in
too
many
dealerships
in
the
same
line-make
in
one
marketing
area
has
brought
a
number
of
states
other
than
california
to
the
same
position.
in
other
words,
some
form
of
legislation
which
limits
the
carte
blanche
authority
of
the
manufacturer
to
establish
a
new
or
additional
dealership
in
a
given
market
area.
19
states
have
statutes
which
are
similar
to
california
in
that
respect.
11
of
these
states
of
these
19,
have
a
board
or
an
official
state
body
that
passes
upon
or
supervises
or
looks
over
in
some
way
this
decision
by
the
manufacturer
to
put
in
an
additional
dealership
in
an
area
already
served
by
a
dealer
carrying
the
same
line-make.
mr.
james
r.
mccall
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
r.
mccall
as
far
as
i
know,
ford
is
the
only
manufacturer
that
has
an
arbitration,
an
institutionalized
arbitration
arrangement
which
is
--
mr.
james
r.
mccall
do
they?
i'm
not
familiar
with
it
if
they
do.
mr.
james
r.
mccall
that
would
appear
to
be
a
recognition
by
the
commercial
entities
involved
of
the
need
for
some
kind
of
regulation
of
this
activity
and
clearly,
congress
and
the
other
state
legislatures
have
felt
the
same
way,
other
state
legislatures
beside
california.
i
would
like
to
pass
to
the
supremacy
clause
argument
which
is
made
by
general
motors
in
this
case.
it
was
not
the
ground
on
which
judges
ely
and
gray
and
takashi
relied
down
below,
but
it
was
urged
to
the
to
the
district
court.
as
i
take
it,
the
supremacy
clause
argument
here
is
that
since
the
california
act,
automobile
franchisers
act
imposes
some
limitation
upon
the
total
freedom
of
general
motors
to
put
a
dealership
in
wherever
and
whenever
they
want
to,
that
this
somehow
conflicts
with
the
central
policy
of
the
sherman
act.
now,
at
the
present
time,
i
know
of
no
case
and
i
certainly
would
stand
corrected
on
this,
where
this
court
has
voided
a
state
statute
on
the
grounds
that
it
conflicts
with
the
sherman
act.
this
court
has
voided
activities
of
price
fixing.
attorneys
have
said
that
monopolistic
practices
on
the
part
of
utilities
are
municipally
owned
and
otherwise
are
subject
to
the
anti-trust
laws,
but
it
is
not
struck
down
as
state
statute
on
the
ground
that
it
conflicted
with
anti-trust
laws.
the
california
supreme
court
has
struck
down
its
liquor
fair
pricing
law
recently
in
a
case
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief
but
as
far
as
i
know
with
this
court
has
not.
i
would
make
so
bold
as
to
partially
that
there
would
have
to
be
two
steps
in
any
such
analysis
which
would
have
to
undergone
before
a
state
statute
could
be
struck
down
on
the
ground
that
it
“violates
the
sherman
act
or
violates
the
central
policy
of
the
sherman
act.
first,
it
would
seem
to
me,
it
would
have
to
be
shown
that
the
state
statute
authorizes
conduct
which
--
but
for
the
state
statute
would
violate
the
sherman
act.
and
secondly,
that
the
statute
authorizes
conduct
which
is
not
“state
action”
as
that
phrase
is
come
to
be
defined
in
a
number
of
decision
which
this
court
has
rendered.
obviously,
state
action
itself
cannot
be
illegal
under
the
sherman
act
and
that
dates
from
parker
versus
brown
and
that
is
a
concept
never
questioned
by
this
court
subsequently.
so,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
an
attack
on
the
only
private
conduct
which
is
really
authorized
by
this
act
and
that
is
the
right
of
a
dealer
to
protest
to
this
board,
that
is
the
only
conduct
undertaken
by
private
party.
now,
we
submit
that
--
mr.
james
r.
mccall
mr.
justice
stevens,
that's
not
authorized
by
the
act.
that's
not
a
conduct
which
is
authorized
by
the
statute.
it
might
be
undertaken.
mr.
james
r.
mccall
i
think
there
would
be
problems
under
the
anti-trust
laws
with
the
claim
--
mr.
james
r.
mccall
oh
yes,
the
collective
agreement,
sure,
between
them
to
engage
in
what,
extortion
or
a
shakedown.
certainly,
i
think
that
could
be
cognizable
under
the
anti-trust
laws,
perhaps
under
some
of
the
other
laws.
mr.
james
r.
mccall
the
unilateral
act.
mr.
james
r.
mccall
well,
each
of
the
dealers
decide
on
their
own
that,
“yes,
they’ll
take
the
$10,000.000.”
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
general
motors
adopting
that
--
mr.
james
r.
mccall
if
the
dealers
felt
that
excessive
competition
was
worth
--
mr.
james
r.
mccall
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
mccall
yes,
as
i
understand,
that's
what
they're
--
mr.
james
r.
mccall
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mccall
yes
it
was.
it
was
one
of
the
grounds
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
james
r.
mccall
no,
the
district
court
specifically
said
it
didn't
have
to
reach
that
issue
because
its
going
off
on
its
notion
of
procedural
due
process.
mr.
james
r.
mccall
well,
of
course,
statutory
claim
is
based
on
the
supremacy
clause,
it
would
seem
to
me
unusual.
mr.
james
r.
mccall
well,
it
would
seem
unusual
to
me,
yes.
mr.
james
r.
mccall
my
position,
i
would
prefer
to
have
this
court
pass
on
it
myself
at
this
point.
it
seems
to
me
the
precedents
are
clear
and
it's
a
point
that
could
be
passed
on
under
the
precedence
that
you
have
because
it
was
urged
to
the
lower
court
indeed.
if
i
may
proceed
on
the
--
my
concept
that
the
conduct
here
would
not
be
illegal
even
if
there
were
no
statute,
the
conduct
authorized,
that
is
a
right
to
protest
to
the
government.
i
would
call
this
court's
attention
and
remind
it
of
the
cases
and
decisions
that's
rendered
in
noerr
and
in
the
pennington
case,
cali
motor
transport
and
other
subsequent
cases
holding
that
the
--
