justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
anti-trust
issue
here
or
the
preemption
of
the
supremacy
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
an
adequately
--
until
he
urges
that
as
a
ground
for
deferments?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
that
presented
to
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
not
dealt
with
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we've
only
--
but
we've
classified
the
supremacy
issues
for
purposes
of
this
policy
with
statutory
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
problem
would
be
cured
here
if
the
california
law
said
that
when
--
you
can't
put
in
a
dealership,
unless
some
--
unless
there's
an
objection
filed.
if
there's
an
objection
filed,
we
shall
hold
a
hearing,
and
you
won't
be
prevented
from
putting
it
in
until
the
hearing
is
over
and
if
it
goes
against
you?
let's
suppose
that's
the
scheme.
they
have
the
hearing
and
they
decide
that
the
objection
is
valid,
we're
not
going
to
permit
another
dealerin
this
area,
would
your
problem
all
be
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
problem
is
devoted
to
the
period
below
before
there
is
a
hearing
in
a
state
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
only
in
my
examples,
the
state
procedures
would
never
be
engaged,
unless
some
private
party
filed
an
objection?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
a
state
can
have
a
general
statute?
justice
stevens
asked
you
about
you
can't
put
it
in
a
dealership
without
permission.
suppose
the
state
said,
before
you
can
establish
a
dealership,
you
must
give
us
notice
and
give
us
90
days
to
investigate
and
meanwhile,
you
may
not
establish
the
dealership.
justice
byron
r.
white
sir?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
you
were
denied
of
due
procedural
process
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
maybe
true
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
maybe
true
but
you're
being
deprived
of
your
liberty,
unless
without
a
hearing
for
90
days.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
(voice
overlap)
we're
dealing
with
my
example,
not
yours.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
official
says,
you
just
give
us
90
days
and
we're
not
talking
to
you
for
90
days.
just
stay
out
for
90
days
and
we
may
give
you
permission,
we
may
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
assuming
--
as
assuming
that
would
be
good,
assuming
that
would
be
acceptable,
do
you
think
putting
it
in
the
hands
of
the
private
party
to
trigger
the
delay
is
itself
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
isn't
quite
a
procedural
due
process
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
really
like
to
get
your
--
i
think
that
to
me
anyway,
the
important
have
your
view
on
whether
you
think
the
state
could
itself
say,
"delay
for
90
days
and
we
won't
talk
to
you
meanwhile,
but
you
got
to
get
our
permission
and
we're
not
going
to
give
it
to
you
for
90
days."
now,
if
that
is
acceptable,
then
you
must
rely
on
the
other
branch
of
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
why
that
makes
it
into
a
procedural
due
process
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
it's
just
general
about
automobile
dealers,
that's
all,
it's
--
it
says
if
you're
going
to
establish
another
dealership
within
a
10-mile
radius,
if
you're
going
to
have
more
than
one,
you
must
give
us
notice
and
you
have
got
to
wait
90
days.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that's
not
the
statute
and
how
about
that
statute,
would
it
be
acceptable
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
would
you
solve
that
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
be
constitutional
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
have
just
given
it
to
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
i
know,
i
never
heard
you
conceded
very
much
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
problem
with
respect
to
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
haven't
we
said
three-judge
courts
would
normally
reach
the
supremacy
clause
issue
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
your
first
submission,
what
should
we
do
with
your
supremacy
clause
issue,
remand
it.
