justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
mr,
mukai,
your
fellow
appellants
have
expressly
abandoned
the
claim
that
the
court
should
have
abstained
under
the
pullman?
justice

(voice

reply
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
any
event,
that
perhaps,
even
though
the
court
could
have
abstained
that
it's
almost
moot
now
and
academic,
since
the
court
did
decide
it
on
the
merits,
they
asked
us
to
decide
it
on
the
merits,
that's
way
i
read
their
reply
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
a
former
--
a
former
member
of
this
court
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
had
a
position
as
a
--
i
think
it
was
the
arbitrator,
maybe
like
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
resolve
differences
between
the
general
motors
on
one
hand
and
its
distributors
and
dealers
on
the
other,
at
least
that
was
my
understanding?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
suggest
that
if
we
--
that
if
we
must
deal
with
--
if
that
issue
is
in
the
case,
that
we
pass
on
it
here
or
we
remand
it?
