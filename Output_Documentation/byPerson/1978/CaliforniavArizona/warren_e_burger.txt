we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
78
original,
state
of
california
against
arizona
and
the
united
states.
mr.
goodman,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white
which
was
put
in
terms
of
your
title
and
you
are
representing
the
state
of
california.
now,
you're
answering
that
question
in
terms
of
the
sovereign's
title
or
the
tile
of
some
of
the
citizens
of
the
sovereign.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
important
difference,
isn't
it,
that
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
sovereign,
the
tile
of
the
sovereign
lands
brings
us
probably
a
clear
original
jurisdiction
case
whereas
the
title
of
the
individual
citizen
claimant
brings
another
question,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock,
the
council.
mr.
goodman
you
may
proceed,
i
see
you
have
supplied
us
with
these
maps
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
some
point,
someone
will
explain
the
map.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
claiborne?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
situation
being
mr.
claiborne,
if
there
were
not
problem
between
the
two
states
which
you
had
private
action
require
title,
private
on
either
one
side
or
the
other,
but
with
federal
riparian
rights
involved,
where
the
federal
government
just
intervene
in
that
private
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
attorney
general
can
give
leave
to
be
sued
in
the
supreme
court
of
los
angeles
county?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
good
until
this
court
or
perhaps
court
of
appeals
got
hold
of
it
and
said
there
was
not
jurisdiction,
but
officially
it
would
be
a
valid
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
goodman,
excuse
me,
yes
mr.
kolsurd.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
that
is
between
the
lines
or
the
contending
private
parties,
what
about
the
victorian
federal
rights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
state
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
by
controlling
all
of
the
state
law
or
there
is,
that
certainly
is
another
reason
to
have
some
judges
ruling
on
it,
you
know
something
about
that
particular
state
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
just
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
just
start
richard
just
in
response
to
the
question
about
the
ames
case.
suppose
the
truck
owned
by
the
state
of
arizona
is
going
over
into
california
as
i'm
sure
they
often
do
and
they
run
off
of
an
overcast
and
do
a
couple
a
thousand
worth
of
damage
to
the
bridge
possibly
any
amount
you
want.
that's
a
suit
between
two
states
potentially
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
--
in
this
court
can
we
take
that
damage
case
in
this
court
under
the
constitution
as
you
see
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
addressing
that
rather
a
sweeping
language
that
seem
to
embrace
cases
simply
because
one
state
was
blaming
against
the
another
without
reference
to
any
federal
question
or
question
arising
under
the
constitution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
goodman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
red
ribbon
on
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
appeal
from
us
in
the
one
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
interlocutory
disposition
to
announce
in
no.

of

now,
the

today
has
ordered
first
