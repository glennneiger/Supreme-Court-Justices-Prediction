mr.
allan
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
upon
the
state
of
california's
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
complaint
against
the
state
of
arizona
and
against
the
united
states.
by
our
motion,
we
seek
to
invoke
this
court's
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
finally
determine
title
to
sovereign
lands
along
an
11.3
mile
reach
of
the
colorado
river.
the
lands
in
this
--
an
issue
in
this
action
are
sovereign
lands
and
were
at
the
time
of
california's
admission
to
the
union
within
the
bed
of
the
colorado
river.
along
the
river
as
the
court
knows
there
have
been
many
accretive
and
avulsive
changes.
these
river
movements'
generated
serious
confusion
and
controversy
until
1966
when
by
an
interstate
boundary
compact
ratified
by
congress
in
that
year,
the
political
boundary
between
the
two
states
was
set
and
permanently
fixed
forever
more.
mr.
allan
goodman
mr.
justice
blackmun
some
of
the
lands
are
within
california
entirely,
some
of
the
lands
like
a
stride
of
the
interstate
border
the
8.6
mile
southern
reach
of
the
river,
it
has
the
political
border
running
approximately
through
the
center,
but
just
approximately
it
does
vary,
but
the
political
boundary
will
not
change
as
a
result
of
this
litigation,
it
will
remain
the
same.
the
problem
we
have
here
again
is
who
owns,
how
much
of
the
last
riverbed
does
california
own,
how
much
of
the
last
riverbed
does
arizona
own.
the
united
states
is
a
party
because
united
states
is
a
principle
upland
owner.
it
owns
the
lands
adjacent
to
the
river
and
as
the
court
knows
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
states
is
the
middle
of
the
main
channel,
in
order
to
fix
the
main
channel
we
must
also
know
the
bank
lines.
mr.
allan
goodman
we
have
put
them
on
generally,
one
of
the
disputes
maybe
over
which
riverbed
is
an
issue
here
there
were
several
main
channels
of
the
colorado
river
at
different
times.
mr.
allan
goodman
that
would
make
a
substantial
difference
is
to
where
the
sovereign
lands
were
located.
as
your
honor
may
recall
the
test
is
one
of
navigability
of
the
water
course
and
the
question
now
is
where
was
that
water
course
on
the
date
of
california's
admission
in
1850
and
where
has
it
moved
by
non-accretive
changes
thereafter.
so
california,
in
1972
because
of
the
concern
over
the
problem
of
location
of
its
sovereign
lands
began
a
study
at
the
request
of
the
state
legislature.
four
years
were
spent
on
that
study
and
a
set
of
maps
was
prepared.
during
the
course
of
the
study
we
communicate
–
the
solicitor
general
has
his
maps
on
his
desk
right
now,
we
communicated
with
the
us
department
of
interior
--
mr.
allan
goodman
they're
not
part
of
the
record
in
the
action.
the
exhibit
to
the
complaint
describes
by
meats
and
bounds
your
honor,
those
lands.
mr.
allan
goodman
it
doesn't
help
me
too
much
either
[attempt
to
laughter]
your
honor,
it
requires
some
elaboration.
mr.
allan
goodman
that
is
correct
your
honor,
these
are
questions
of
title.
they're
--
boundary
questions
only
if
one
defines
a
location
of
the
state's
land,
it's
a
boundary
question,
this
will
not
change
the
political
boundary
of
the
river.
mr.
allan
goodman
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
allan
goodman
we
have
done
that
in
the
exhibit
to
the
complaint
your
honor.
we
have
taken
as
a
result
of
the
study
which
was
done
in
1970
--
mr.
allan
goodman
they
would
have
to,
they
could
then
respond
quite
in
that
manner.
mr.
allan
goodman
no,
it's
not
a
question
of
law
only
your
honor
but
--
mr.
allan
goodman
we're
answering
solely
on
behalf
of
the
sovereign,
if
i
made
or
began
to
respond
to
--
mr.
allan
goodman
yes.
these
are
solely
sovereign
lands
that
--
mr.
allan
goodman
yes,
it
very
well
may
your
honor.
mr.
allan
goodman
some
of
the
lands
are
on
the
arizona
side
in
the
2.6
mile
upper
reach
of
the
river.
they're
entirely
within
the
california,
and
the
8.6
mile
lower
reach
as
you
described
the
political
boundary.
we
know
if
i
could
respond
your
earlier
question
of
the
court
that
we
are
in
the
right
ballpark
because
we
discussed
with
the
united
states
and
with
the
state
of
arizona.
their
claims
in
fact,
the
exhibit
to
the
complaint
here
is
based
upon
aerial
surveys
done
by
the
united
states
government
earlier
so
we're
in
the
right
–-
mr.
allan
goodman
we're
as
far
as
--
mr.
allan
goodman
the
answer
for
that
is
no
your
honor.
we've
been
attempting
-
if
i
could
say,
we
know
we're
in
the
colorado
river,
we
presented
our
information
to
the
state
of
arizona
and
the
united
states
and
asked
them
to
agree.
they
simply
would
not
agree
and
that
is
the
reason
why
we're
before
the
court
today.
mr.
allan
goodman
they
simply
will
not
give
any
--
give
us
an
answer
yes
or
no.
arizona
told
us
we
would
have
to
sue
them
in
order
to
get
a
response.
mr.
allan
goodman
well,
this
is
the
map
adopted
by
the
california
state
land's
commission
which
is
the
basis
for
the
exhibit
a
to
our
complaint.
mr.
allan
goodman
yes,
we're
quite
sure.
mr.
allan
goodman
i
don't
know
i'm
afraid
mr.
justice
marshall
that
you
have
to
ask
this
to
the
solicitor
general.
i
do
not
know
whether
they
agree
or
not.
they
have
said
in
their
response.
mr.
allan
goodman
well,
i
think
should
the
court
grant
the
motion
and
appoint
a
special
master
then
the
master
would
take
it,
take
evidence
on
the
subject
and
the
lands
would
become
fixed.
we
think
we're
in
the
right
ballpark
and
the
parties
can
agree
if
i
make
–-
mr.
allan
goodman
no
your
honor
california
knows
where
the
strip
of
land
is.
mr.
allan
goodman
well,
we
know
where
the
land
is.
the
problem
is
created
by
the
meanderings
of
the
course
of
the
river
that
is
the
essential
problem
in
all
interstate
boundary
river
cases,
if
you
will,
and
the
problem
is
to
establish
the
exact
perimeters
of
that
land.
this
case
is
no
different
than
interstate
river
boundary
case
in
that
respect.
mr.
allan
goodman
we've
accounted
for
that
your
honor
in
the
description.
it's
done
of
the
california
coordinate
system
with
certain
--
mr.
allan
goodman
that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
two
principle
issues
of
a
legal
nature
before
the
court
at
this
time.
the
first
one
is
whether
this
case
is
within
this
court's
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
or
whether
is
arizona
phrases
the
question
may
arizona
consent
to
an
action
in
a
district
court.
the
united
states
and
california
both
agree
on
this
issue
that
arizona
may
not
consent
to
that
jurisdiction.
the
second
issue
has
made
the
united
states
to
be
sued
in
this
court
or
is
sued
probably
about
only
in
the
district
court.
let
me
turn
now
into
the
issue
of
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
or
the
issue
of
consent.
mr.
allan
goodman
your
honor
i
don't
think
so,
because
as
this
court
said,
albeit
indicted
united
states
versus
nevada.
the
presence
of
the
united
states
as
a
party
is
not;
would
not
change
the
essential
original
jurisdiction
of
the
action.
i
believe
the
language
is,
at
least
the
court's
language
was
that
this
clause
-
the
section
is
construed
as
applicable
to
suits
involving
conflicting
state
claims
by
one
state
against
another
regardless
of
the
presence
of
the
united
states
as
a
party,
and
of
course
has
concurrent
albeit
not
exclusive
jurisdiction
actions
between
the
state
and
united
states.
arizona's
contention
however
is
based
we
submit
upon
a
misconstruction
of
the
term
jurisdiction.
as
we
define
it,
it
is
the
authority
to
hear
and
adjudicate
disputes
and
in
this
particular
instance,
states
and
the
united
states
because
of
their
status
as
parties
confer
that
kind
of
jurisdiction.
the
answer,
the
basis
for
our
contention
is
found
in
clause
1
of
article
3
of
section
2
of
the
constitution,
which
does
confer
those
two
types
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
allan
goodman
no
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
allan
goodman
i
recognize
that
early
on
this
court
held
that
the
clause
2
of
article
3
section
2
did
not
preclude
suits
between
states
and
lower
courts,
but
the
congress
in
the
first
judiciary
act
--
mr.
allan
goodman
continued
to
this
day
provided
that
until
1948
it
was,
if
the
suit
-
if
any
state
were
a
party
after
48
if
the
controversy
were
between
two
states
that
this
court
had
exclusive
as
well
as
original
jurisdiction.
the
problem
with
arizona's
contention
is
that
they
are
confusing
if
you
will,
the
question
of
whether
a
party
can
be
served
with
the
question
of
whether
a
court
has
power
to
adjudicate
to
hear
and
decide
the
dispute.
mr.
allan
goodman
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
answer
to
that
lies
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
1346(f).
when
the
section
was
enacted
as
part
of
public
law
92-562,
it
began
as
s216.
at
the
time
of
introduction,
there
was
no
word
exclusive
in
section
1346(f),
but
the
justice
department
sent
a
letter
which
is
quoted,
a
part
of
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief
and
footnote
in
our
motion
which
indicates,
which
says
that
the
purpose
of
the
addition
of
the
term
exclusive
was
to
preclude
suits
in
the
state
courts,
the
united
states
did
not
want
to
be
named
as
a
party
in
state
court,
but
to
have
its
claims
adjudicate
solely
in
federal
courts.
that's
the
only
purpose
for
the
term
exclusive
was
to
surmount
the
problem
created,
for
example,
or
discuss,
for
example,
in
trials
charles
dowd
box
company
versus
courtney,
whereby
state
court's
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
unless
it
is
specifically
excluded,
that
is
a
sole
meaning
for
the
term
exclusive.
mr.
allan
goodman
i
think
the
term
exclusive
are
used
in
two
different
respects
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
1346(f)
the
sole
purpose
of
the
term
is
to
preclude
suits
in
state
courts
and
that's
worn
out
by
the
legislative
history.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
which
indicates
any
intention
to
preclude
this
suit
from
hearing
cases
which
are
within
its
original
jurisdiction,
and
let
me
continue
on
that
point,
because
it's
very
important
for
a
party
to
construe
1346(f)
as
precluding
a
suit
in
this
court
would
be
to
be
denying
this
court
jurisdiction
vested
in
this
court
by
the
constitution.
it
has
been
clear
since
at
least
marbury
versus
madison
that
the
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
either
increase
or
decrease
this
court's
original
jurisdictions.
so
1346(f)
cannot
be
read
to
borrow
a
suit
in
this
court.
mr.
allan
goodman
exactly,
in
order
to
avoid
the
unconstitutional
construction,
the
legislative
history
should
be
relied
upon
to
confer
to
construe
1346(f)
constitutionally.
mr.
allan
goodman
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
don't
think
we
have
any
remedy
then,
we
have
no
other
form
in
which
we
can
litigate
both
against
the
united
states
and
against
arizona.
mr.
allan
goodman
by
our
understanding
of
the
jurisdiction
provision
your
honor,
under
article
3,
we
could
not
sue
both
arizona
and
the
united
states
in
district
court,
there
is
no
statute
--
mr.
allan
goodman
it
has
said
that
it
would
consent,
but
my
first
argument
is
your
honor
that
arizona
doesn't
have
the
power
to
consent,
because
number
1,
article
3
section
2
clauses
1
and
2
do
not
permit
and
section
1251a1
provides
this
court
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
actions
between
the
states
to
say,
also
to
say
--
mr.
allan
goodman
that's
exactly
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
allan
goodman
we
could
sue
if
the
court
granted
leave
arizona
alone
in
this
court.
however,
we
need
the
united
states
because
we
cannot
fix
the
center
line
of
the
river
without
knowing
--
also
having
the
bank
lines
to
term
it
and
the
united
states.
mr.
allan
goodman
well,
they
have
suggested
as
much
and
that
would
be
fine
with
us.
mr.
allan
goodman
and
that's
exactly
the
problem
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
we
feel
the
entire
area
has
to
be
adjudicated.
mr.
allan
goodman
that's
my
understanding
of
this
mr.
general's
brief
your
honor.
mr.
allan
goodman
mr.
justice
blackmun,
we
would
not
have
one
judgment
binding
on
all
the
parties
if
we
try
to
do
that
and
that's
our
problem,
we
had
two
separate
judgments.
the
united
states
contention,
if
i
could
respond
to
that
is
that
2409a
of
title
28
and
1346(f)
constitute
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
only
as
the
district
court
from
my
discussion
of
the
problem
of
the
legislative
history
in
section
1346(f),
it's
clear
to
us
and
we
submit
that
the
court
should
so
hold
that
1346(f)
was
only
intended
to
bar
suits
in
state
courts.
second,
we
don't
think
the
united
states
give
sufficient
way
to
2409a
that
is
the
section
which
waives
sovereign
immunity,
also
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
should
be
liberally
construed.
the
united
states
construction
was
extremely
narrow
and
if
it's
granted
it
would
mean
that
there
would
be
no
form
in
which
we
could
sue
both
the
federal
government
and
arizona.
mr.
allan
goodman
we
want
to
do
it
in
one
action
so
that
we
can
have
one
enforceable
judgment.
we
are
concerned
about
the
or
if
i'd
submit
your
honor
as
a
court
of
equity
this
court
has
the
power
to
combine
the
two
defendant
parties
so
that
we
have
one
effective
degree.
otherwise
again,
we
do
not
have
a
form
and
if
i
may
mr.
justice
brennan
what
is
worse
if
this
court
denies
our
motion
and
we
have
no
and
if
we're
left
to
suit
against
the
united
states
in
district
court
and
the
united
states
then
disclaims
ownership
under
2409a
subdivision
d
the
district
court
must
then
dismiss
the
action
it
specifically
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
jurisdiction
in
which
case
california
and
arizona
would
be
coming
back
to
this
court
again
and
it
would
be
clearly
within
the
court's
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
allan
goodman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
that
is
correct.
mr.
allan
goodman
you're
very
welcome
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
allan
goodman
very
well
your
honor,
the
clerk's
office
was
kind
enough
to
make
copies
of
them
during
the
lunch-recess.
the
court
has
before
it
a
part
of
the
facesheet
of
the
administrative
maps
and
what
describes
on
the
second
and
larger
page,
the
chronological
history
of
the
movements
of
the
river
prior
to
1946
the
upper
left
the
court
will
see
the
river
it
wasn't
essentially
a
natural
state
that
maybe
a
subject
to
dispute
during
the
course
of
the
litigation,
it
gradually
moved
to
the
point
in
the
fifth
map,
lower
right
in
set
five,
where
the
court
and
it's
difficult
to
see
we'll
see
--
the
court
may
see
the
political
boundary
coming
down
from
almost
the
center
of
that
box
in
a
dash
line.
it
goes
through
what
is
described
as
a
pilot
channel,
and
then
curves
back
around
to
the
right,
through
the
colorado
river
from
a
main
channel,
that
is
a
political
boundary,
roughly
down
the
center
of
the
pilot
channel.
this
litigation
however
includes
the
area
also
north
of
the
pilot
channel,
which
described
as
palo
verde
lagoon,
that
area
is
entirely
within
the
state
of
california.
the
area
which
is
below
the
intersection
palo
verde
lagoon
and
that
little
v
to
the
south
is
the
point
where
the
sovereign
land
and
title
question
describe
the
interstate
border
again.
mr.
allan
goodman
mr.
justice
brennan,
it's
the
upper
segment
it's
the
north
of
--
the
court
will
see
the
pilot
channel
on
the
palo
verde
lagoon
that
area
to
the
north
is
a
segment.
point
to
it
on
the
map,
so
we
can
identify
them
already
up
above,
i
see
it.
mr.
allan
goodman
it's
up
above
that
right,
right
there.
and
now,
the
government's
contention
is
there
are
pre
--
there
are
surveys
which
are
more
than
12
years
old
and
even
if
there
weren't
by
1346
f
the
government
can
only
be
a
suit
in
the
district
court.
however,
as
i
indicated
before
lunch
to
argue
that
means
that
the
congress
has
removed
jurisdiction
from
this
court
and
that
of
course
is
contrary
to
marbury
v.
madison.
very
briefly
with
respect
to
arizona's
contention
that
it
can
confirm
jurisdiction,
again
that
is
party
jurisdiction
and
the
case
is
which
arizona
cites
to
the
extent
that
they
supports
it's
position
or
party
jurisdiction
questions
can
we
serve
this
defendant
in
a
district
court.
they
do
not
go
to
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
court
to
hear
and
decide
the
case
and
our
position
is
under
article
3
sec
(2)
that
power
is
vested
and
under
1251
(a)(1)
that
power
is
vested
solely
in
this
court.
mr.
allan
goodman
yes
in
response
to
earlier
question
i
answered
that,
i
didn't
mean
to
--
mr.
allan
goodman
that's
correct.
if
congress
so
said,
the
congress
has
been
very
specific
in
this
case.
indeed
that
reading
i
think
is
borne
out
by
this
court's
opinion
--
certain
of
the
dictum,
this
court's
opinion
in
illinois
versus
city
of
milwaukee
and
other
recent
cases
where
the
court
that
was
not
considering
questions
between
two
states,
with
a
state
and
instrumentalities,
which
the
court
found
to
be
local
and
not
state
entities,
but
the
inverse
the
situation
described
there
is
the
one
where
regional
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
because
two
states
are
parties.
i
think
on
page
93
of
406
us
that
statement
appears.
mr.
allan
goodman
in
our
request
for
continuing
jurisdiction
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
do
ask
the
court
to
decide
that
question.
we
don't
think
however
that
the
court
needs
to
decide
or
request
on
the
continuing
jurisdiction
point
at
this
time.
i'm
aware
that
your
honor
was
involved
in
some
litigation
reported
north
of
needle's
area
--
mr.
allan
goodman
along
the
border
this
dispute
is
south
of
blithe.
the
principles
will
be
very
similar
that
will
be
factual
difference
only
i
would
expect.
the
legal
principles
are
very
important.
they
are
important
not
only
for
the
parties
here,
but
to
other
states
which
have
inter-state
boundary
problems
resolving
from
river
movements.
mr.
allan
goodman
this
case
is
extremely
significant
since
pollard's
lessee
v.
hagan,
it's
been
clear
that
question
to
the
sovereign
lands
adjudication
is
appropriate
for
this
court's
decision.
in
this
particular
case,
california
needs
to
know
the
location
of
its
sovereign
lands
and
confirm
its
title,
so
that
we
can
one
protect
them
from
environmental
degradation
and
two
construct
recreational
resources,
the
river
has
become
a
tremendous
focal
point
for
recreation
and
before
the
state
can
properly
respond
for
the
need,
we
have
to
know
where
our
title
is,
so
that
if
we
construct
facilities
we
can
do
so.
mr.
allan
goodman
how
are
they?
mr.
allan
goodman
yes,
your
honor
we
think
that
we
cannot
litigate
the
question
of
the
central
line
without
having
the
united
states
because
it
is
the
owner
of
the
upland.
mr.
allan
goodman
i
think
the
technical
strict
reading
would
be
yes,
they
say
that
they
would
intervene
in
this
court.
mr.
allan
goodman
that's
correct.
mr.
allan
goodman
that's
correct.
mr.
allan
goodman
our
position
on
that
your
honor
was
1346
f
is
being
read
by
the
united
states
to
deny
the
purpose.
mr.
allan
goodman
okay.
i
thank
the
court
very
much.
mr.
allan
goodman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
arizona
speaks
of
the
possibility
that
1346
f
makes
1251
a1
a
grant
of
concurrent
rather
than
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
talks
about
the
pre
1948
judicial
code.
we
submit
that
the
congress's
amendment
of
the
code
in
1948
makes
the
plain
language
very
clear
and
then
it's
the
plain
language
that
has
to
control
here
and
that's
the
plain
language
of
1251.
as
professor
james
moore,
the
special
consultant
advisors
of
the
1948
code
stated
in
his
previous
commentary
on
the
judicial
code,
“a
large
of
number
of
changes
many
of
considerable
importance,
have
been
laid
here
--
have
been
made
the
code
should
be
construed
with
this
in
mind
and
where
plain
language
works
to
change
in
formal
law
this
change
should
be
given
effect”
that's
at
page
83.
in
fact
what
occurred
in
1948
was,
there
was
a
change
in
the
prior
law,
prior
to
1948
the
statute
provided
for
exclusive
jurisdiction
where
any
case
was
a
party
this
court
in
us
versus
california
in
297
u.s
constitute
that
as
permitting
a
grant
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
lower
courts,
but
congress
changed
all
that
in
1948
and
our
submission
is
that
that
change
in
addition
to
reasons
i
gave
during
my
opening
preclude
the
construction
which
arizona
advances.
as
for
whether
this
is
an
important
case
we
submit
that
it
is.
these
are
indeed
sovereign
lands.
we
didn't
think
there
was
any
dispute
about
that
their
lands
which
inured
the
california
by
virtue
of
its
sovereignty
and
arizona
by
virtue
of
its.
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
importance
of
those
lands
that's
been
clear
since
pollard
lessee
v.
hagan,
whether
we
want
to
be
here
or
not.
we
understand
that
the
court
has
a
tremendous
appellate
workload
and
we've
read
the
list
of
cases
which
were
cited
in
a
concurring
opinion
recently
this
term
but
we
regret
to
say
that
under
our
construction
we
have
no
choice,
that's
what
congress
has
said
and
there
is
simply
no
alternative.
the
issues
are
important
for
other
states
as
well.
the
choice
of
law
question
which
mr.
justice
white
raised
in
a
very
intriguing
one,
under
nebraska
vs.
iowa
406
u.s,
it
would
appear
that
as
to
lands
located
within
each
state,
the
law
of
each
state
would
apply.
the
question
as
to
the
law
of
the
boundary
between
federal
and
state
land
is
particularly
intriguing
because
as
the
court
knows
these
lands.
mr.
allan
goodman
finally,
your
honor
we
think
it
doesn't
exist
after
corvallis.
mr.
allan
goodman
that's
exact,
thank
you
honor
i
was
just
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
for
the
court
in
corvallis,
this
land
near
to
the
state
under
the
equal
shooting
doctrine
by
virtue
of
our
sovereignty
and
thus
it
is
a
constitution
which
should
determine
what
rights
arise
and
how
those
rights
are
decided
as
to
that
federal
land.
i
think
that
adds
to
the
distinction
after.
mr.
allan
goodman
that's
right.
mr.
allan
goodman
i
think
mr.
justice
white
in
this
case
state
law
may
have.
mr.
allan
goodman
yes,
may
govern
the
entire
controversy,
the
question,
the
next
question
that
comes
is
was
the
affect
of
the
source
of
the
states
law,
source
of
the
grant
upon
the
united
states
contention
of
1346
--
can
the
congress
affect
or
change
the
grant,
excuse
me,
can
a
grant
of
--
can
the
inuring
of
the
trust
land
in
the
states
is
superseded
by
a
grant,
by
a
statute
of
the
congress.
mr.
allan
goodman
we
don't
think
that
we
can
get
effective
judicial
relief
in
this
court
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
allan
goodman
we
have
no
choice
because
we
couldn't
enforce
that
decree.
mr.
allan
goodman
but
mr.
justice
ben,
i
can
only
respond
with
the
question
that
is
would
we
then
have
one
judgment
or
two
i
think
the
answer
is
we
would
have
two
judgments.
mr.
allan
goodman
so
they
make
two
judgments.
mr.
allan
goodman
well,
if
i
may
take
the
chief
justice's
analogy
the
judge
would
be
wearing
two
ribbons
and
the
colors
would
be
different
and
the
question
on
appeal
than
again…
mr.
allan
goodman
well
that
was
our
first
question.
mr.
allan
goodman
but
in
the
second
one
what
would
it
occur,
i
simply
don't,
you
don't
have
to
answer
for
that
question
i
submit
that
the
only
sensible
way.
thank
you
your
honor
it's
for
this
court
to
take
this
case
thanks,
thank
you
very
much.
