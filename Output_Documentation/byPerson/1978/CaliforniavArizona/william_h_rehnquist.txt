justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
are
questions
of
title
not
boundary,
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
meats
and
bounds
description
will
vary
from
arizona
to
california
because
they
use
different
meridians.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
san
bernardino
basin
meridian.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
you
do
with
1346(f)
then,
it
says
that
district
courts
have
exclusive
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
your
answer
doesn't
comport
with
the
use
of
the
terms
in
section
28
usc
1251
with
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
where
the
congress
said
the
supreme
court
shall
have
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
where
it
was
talking
about
this
court
as
opposed
to
lower
federal
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
as
a
matter
of
prudence
we
ought
to
construe
it
that
way
even
though
there
is
some
doubt
in
order
to
avoid
the
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goodman,
i
would
just
love
to
take
up
the
time
of
the
rest
of
the
court.
i've
debated
disqualify
myself
in
this
litigation
because
of
the
fact
i
was
involved
in
a
good
deal
of
private
litigation.
so
is
this
the
entire
arizona,
california
boundary
that
california
seeks
to
litigate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
concern
was
familiarity
from
expert
testimony
as
to
factual
matters
not
with
the
legal
matter.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
the
united
states
an
indispensable
party
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
united
states
position
is
that
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
get
into
any
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
say
that
they
haven't
given
concern.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
say
that
you
are
not
subject
to
arizona
and
you
can't
litigate
in
the
district
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there
is
no
judicial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
understand.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
claiborne,
jury
2409(a)
has
waiving
sovereign
immunity
only
for
suits
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
read
exclusive
in
1346
as
meaning
exclusive
of
this
court,
there
are,
to
put
mildly,
grave
constitutional
difficulties,
are
they
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
why
the
united
state
submits
to
this
north
of
the.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
--
what
authority
do
you
need
to
submit
to
an
adjudication
in
this
court
to
settle
this
title?
does
it
take
some
conventional
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
himself
to
way
by
becoming
plaintiff
and
to
do
that
by
intervention.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
claiborne,
if
you
are
right
as
the
indispensable
parties
within
the
logic
of
your
position
require
that
we
dismiss
the
case
as
between
the
states
even
though
you
don't
make
any
intervention
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
supposing
if
the
united
states
is
sued
in
the
supreme
court
of
los
angeles
county
to
acquire
title.
do
you
think
the
united
states
attorney
in
los
angeles
can
walk
into
that
court
and
say
he
now
gives
leave
for
the
united
states
to
be
sued?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
clear
what
do
you
mean
discretion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
wasn't
the
intimation
in
arizona
versus
the
new
mexico
that
it
wasn't
appropriate
because
the
state
really
it
wasn't
representing
its
own
interest,
but
rather
the
interest
of
a
private
plaintiff.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
call
for
boundary
dispute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
was
original
but
not
exclusive.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
due
you
think
wyandotte
is
consistent
with
of
the
subsequent
opinion
illinois
versus
milwaukie.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
your
case
aims
against
kansas
at
111
u.s.
449.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
language
of
chief
justice
rate
there
that
the
evident
purpose
of
clause
you
are
refereeing
to
was
to
open
and
keep
open
the
highest
court
of
the
nation
for
the
determination
in
the
first
instance
of
suits
involving
a
state
or
a
diplomatic
or
commercial
representative.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
don't
you
have
to
argue
if
the
congress
was
prevented
from
doing
that
by
article
3.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
have
to
argue
that
not
that
article
3
required
congress
to
make
the
jurisdiction
exclusive
in
1251
but
then
it
prevented
it
from
doing
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
by
article
3.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
your
argument
that
the
jury
just
made,
perhaps
i
misunderstood.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
contrary
to
ames,
isn't
it,
where
it's
says
keep
open
the
highest
court
of
the
nation
for
determination
of
suits
involving
states.
