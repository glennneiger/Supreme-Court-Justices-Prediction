unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is,
california
is
to
sue
united
states
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
how
did
you
get
waive
or
sovereign
immunity
on
--
united
states.
unknown
speaker
this
thing
would
be
sued
under
the
2409a.
unknown
speaker
but
how
about,
there
is
also
a
fight
between
the
two
states,
what
about
that
dispute,
why
isn't
that
within
the
exclusive
jurisdictional
of
this
court?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
you
are
going
to
get
to
that
i
think,
this
your
discussion,
argument,
is
it?
yes,
we
have
discussion
and
even
though
it
is
within
our
exclusive
jurisdiction.
but
under
arizona
and
new
mexico
you're
suggesting
we
have
discussion
nevertheless
to
let
the
case
be
decided
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
well
maybe
so
but
how
about
of
the
power
of
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
how
but
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
under,
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned
congress
could
let
two
states
litigate
each
other
in
a
district
court.
unknown
speaker
but
how
about
1251?
unknown
speaker
so
the
boundary
disputes
might
arise
in
the
statutes
what
the
admission
statutes
or.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
just
before
you
sit
down
the
--
suppose
this
court
said
that
well
the
united
states
doesn't
want
to
come
in
here,
it
claim
its
indispensable,
but
we
don't
think
it's
indispensable
all
if
california
wants
to
go
ahead
against
arizona
in
this
court,
it
may,
if
it's
wants
to
would
you
want
to?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
no,
you'd
rather
have
the
case
you
would
ask
the
case
to
be
dismissed
as
united
states
isn't
--
