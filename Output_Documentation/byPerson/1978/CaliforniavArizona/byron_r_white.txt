justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
asking,
you
want
your
title
quited
(ph)?
justice
byron
r.
white
usually
to
acquire
a
title
you
say
what
property
you're
acquiring
title
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
suppose
the
defendants
say
that
you
haven't
described
the
lands
correctly?
justice
byron
r.
white
first
of
all,
what
i
mean,
the
question
--
i
suppose
many
questions
of
fact
could
arise
in
this
case,
it's
just
isn't
a
question
of
law
and
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
i
wanted
to
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
it
is
because
of
the
constitution
that
arizona
and
california
may
not
litigate
in
the
district
court
even
if
both
of
them
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
just
because
of
the
statute
of
section
1251?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
could
also
sue,
could
you
sue
arizona
alone
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
the
government
commend
here
optionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
government
says
is
if
we
take
it
here
someday
they
all
come
in,
but
limited
only
to
a
given
segment,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
arizona
be
an
indispensable
party
if
california
sued
the
united
states
in
the
district
court,
which
it
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
basis
for
your
saying
that
the
united
states
is
indispensable
party
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can't
california
and
arizona
settle
their
dispute
in
litigation
without
having
the
united
states
around?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
do
it
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
becoming
plaintiff,
but
he
just,
he
wouldn't
have
authority
just
to
not
raise
your
sovereign
immunity
defense
here
as
a
party
defendant.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
is
the
limitation
that
you
would
insist
on
this
court
to
become
a
third
party
to
this
case?
what
limitations
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
it
just
are
there
some
--
are
there
some
legal
principles
involved
in
this
case
or
is
it
all
just
a
factual
fake?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it's
there
is
a
major
if
the
major
part
of
its
legal
principle
would
be
settled
by
litigating
the
segment
south
of
the
pilot
cut.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
clear
if
you
were
allowed
to
come
in
only
as
to
that
lower
segment
what
then
is
the
status
of
title
as
to
that
northern
segment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
how
are
we
ever
going
to
solve
the
outsider
with
those
views?
justice
byron
r.
white
whose
rule
state
or
federal?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
i
know,
but
i
thought
what
you
said
earlier,
i
forget
these
numbers.
there
isn't
any
jurisdiction
in
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
really,
i
would
take
it
the
suit
in
a
state
court
of
attorney
general
went
in
said
sure,
here
we
are
service,
sue
us
and
he
got
a
judgment
against
the
united
states
still
went
very
good.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
suppose
we
have
raised
file
subject
to
the
united
states
meaning
that
the
united
states
intervene
within
whatever
reservations
within
that
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
an
adjudication
which
settled
the
title
to
some
particular
land
say
the
land
south
of
this
cut,
i
would
suppose
you
would
think
the
land
with
the
title
would
be
settled
there
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
intervene
then
submitted
with
respect
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
what
becomes
of
the
suggestion
that
that
title
to
land
in
a
suit
against
the
united
states
or
involving
the
united
states
is
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
can
you
waive
that
too
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
deprives
the
state
courts
of
jurisdiction
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
it
deprives
the
state
court
of
jurisdiction,
but
not
this
court
to
adjudicate
the
title
to
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne
before
you
sit
down
it
just
one
thing
i
did
not
understand.
if
this
court
were
to
construe
the
word
exclusive
in
1346(f)
is
just
for
closing
an
action
not
the
state
courts,
but
not
for
closing
an
action
in
this
court,
why
would
you,
did
you,
did
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say
that
the
action
would
not
be
a
2409
action
and
if
so
why
wouldn't
it
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
with
respect
to
your
12
year
defense,
you
still
fit
a
certainty.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
problem
is
the
world
exclusive
in
1346
(f).
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
body
of
law
would
govern
this
litigation
is
there
any
state
law
in
it
or
is
it
all
federal.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
problem
is
when
--
because
1251
does
talk
about
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
said
that
no
district
court
so
however
have
jurisdiction
of
suit
between
two
states
that's
really
what
it
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
wouldn't
think
you
could
concept,
you
can't
confer
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
by
finally
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
how
about
corvallis.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
the
choice
of
laws
of
constitutional
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you
decide
the
state
law
decide
to
govern.
justice
byron
r.
white
entirely,
the
entire
controversy.
