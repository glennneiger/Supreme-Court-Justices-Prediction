mr.
louis
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
question
before
this
court
is
must
this
case
be
in
this
court?
we
very
much
wish
we
could
answer
that
question
no,
partly
on
the
ground
that
this
court
is
enough
for
the
business,
but
the
concern
itself
which
is
relatively
minor
acreage
and
it's
not
a
boundary
dispute
it's
simply
a
matter
of
title
to
land.
and,
i
mean
i
had
so
does
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general
have
enough
other
business.
we
would
welcome
a
ruling
that
accept
the
arizona's
argument
to
the
affect
that
this
litigation
maybe
appropriately
begun
in
a
district
court.
but
unfortunately,
we've
not
found
the
weight
of
that
conclusion.
as
this
already
been
made
clear,
the
obstacle
is
not
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
it's
simply
the
provision
of
the
district
court
sec
1251
(a)
(1),
which
seems
plainly
to
confine
a
controversy
between
two
states
to
this
court
alone
by
using
the
word
exclusive.
it's
clear,
of
course
that
the
importance
of
two
states
is
not
requiring
that
the
case
be
in
this
court.
they
must
be
on
opposite
sides;
they
must
be
adversaries
that
were
clearly
settled
in
the
pyramid
lake
case
united
states
versus
nevada
reported
in
volume
412
in
the
united
states
reports.
but
here
california
and
arizona
are
on
opposites
sides
of
the
case
and
so
far
it
appears
do
dispute
title
to
at
least
a
part
of
the
land
put
in
question
by
california's
complaint.
it
might
be
argued
that
because
the
united
states
is
sought
to
be
made
a
defendant,
one
looks
not
at
1252
(a)(1),
but
rather
at
1252
(b)(2),
which
provides
that
when
the
united
states
and
a
state
of
parties
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
as
many
can
cut.
it
seems
to
us
was
however
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
united
states
does
not
change
the
basic
fact,
which
is
that
this
is
a
controversy
between
two
states.
and
indeed
again
in
the
nevada
case
this
court
adverted
to
the
fact
that
the
state
parties
there
were
not
adverse
and
accordingly
there
wasn't
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
the
court
did
not
notice
the
presence
of
the
united
states
as
pointed
has
having
any
bearing
on
it
one
way
or
the
other
it
seems
to
us
that
was
plainly
right.
mr.
louis
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
the
private
parties
could
by
virtue
of
2409(a)
sue
the
united
states,
sovereign
immunity
having
been
waived
by
the
congress
in
the
appropriate
district
court
and
there
would
have
been
no
problem
or
whatever.
in
deed
that
would
be
the
situation
even
if
one
state
were
a
defendant,
it's
only
that
the
two
states
are
disputing
title
that
presents
the
problem
here.
mr.
louis
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
have
thought
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
united
states
is
an
indispensable
party,
so
would
arizona.
so
long
as
it
declines
to
accept
the
davis
lake
study,
which
california
has
put
before
it
in
which
it
inferentially
or
widely
disputes.
mr.
louis
claiborne
2409(a)
itself,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
of
course
does
not
say
that,
but
at
the
very
time
when
that
statute
was
written
section
1346
of
the
judicial
court
was
amended
by
the
same
legislation,
so
as
to
provide
that
suits
under
2409(a)
shall
be
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts.
110
read
exclusive
that
differently
then
in
section
1251,
perfectly
explained
i
think
has
correctly
said
that
attorney
general
of
california
that
the
purpose
they
have
just
came
from
attorney
general.
the
purpose
was
to
prevent
the
government's
being
sued
in
a
state
court.
the
question
of
original
cases
simply
did
not
occur
to
the
mind
of
congress,
it
seems
recently
obvious.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
hard
to
read
the
word
exclusive
in
the
same
judicial
code
as
meaning
all
federal
court's
generally
in
one
case
and
in
1251
meaning
a
particular
federal
court.
mr.
louis
claiborne
i
would
have
thought
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
after
all,
if
it
had
not
been
for
2409
nothing
in
the
constitution
waives
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
in
the
case
if
the
suit
by
a
state,
that
is
always
been
the
constitutional
rule
that
a
state
could
not
sue
the
united
states
without
it's
consent
and
that
problem
has
been
resolved
over
the
years
by
the
united
states
agreeing
to
be
plaintiff
or
agreeing
to
intervene.
this
waiver
statute
is
constitutionally
have
its
limited
purpose
of
allowing
suits
only
in
the
district
court.
it
maybe
nonsense
as
a
matter
of
policy,
it
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
when
you
are
talking
of
--
mr.
louis
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
for
the
same
reason
that
california
has
joined
this
is
in
the
first
place
that
the
location
and
width
of
the
bed
which
is
half
of
which
they
claim
in
the
old
bed
of
the
colorado
river
affects
federal
lands
on
either
side
of
that
area.
i
mean
to
say
this
it
may
clarify
matter
a
little
california
--
mr.
louis
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
white
the
first
problem
is
where
they
would
do
that.
mr.
louis
claiborne
the
united
states
is
willing
to
facilitate
matters
at
least
in
part
by
intervening
so
as
to
make
that
possible.
we
haven't
found
a
way
of
making
it
entirely
possible
without
waiving
a
limitations
defense
in
affect.
mr.
louis
claiborne
i
would
make
that
more
clear
than
it's
just
been,
north
of
this
pilot
cut
junction,
which
is
the
smaller
distance
to
the
north
on
the
map,
the
2.7
miles
i
believe
it
is.
the
united
states
surveyed
and
the
survey
was
proved
and
published
in
1961;
that
was
a
survey
not
as
of
that
date,
but
survey
of
where
the
old
bed
had
been
previous
to
that
cut
that
is
to
say
1946
and
1947.
2409
in
waiving
sovereign
immunity
has
provided
that
the
united
states
shall
not
have
its
title
put
in
the
issue
with
respect
to
any
federal
claim
more
than
12
years
old.
if
we
were
in
the
district
court,
we
would
be
invoking
that
statute
limitation
with
respect
to
california's
claim
is
against
north
of
the
pilot
cut.
we
say
this
statute
doesn't
apply
in
the
supreme
court,
but
on
the
other
hand
if
we
are
going
to
follow
the
spirits
of
the
statute
by
agreeing
to
intervene
we
are
also
be
entitled
to
follow
the
spirit
of
limitations
provisions
by
invoking.
mr.
louis
claiborne
at
least
whether
the
matters
have
been
litigated
or
not
i'm
not
aware
mr.
justice
white
but
it's
always
be
fought
the
attorney
general
and
solicitor
general
had
authority
toâ€¦
mr.
louis
claiborne
it
might
come
to
the
same
thing
mr.
justice
white
it's
always
been
fought
proper
to
do
by
informally
--
mr.
louis
claiborne
only
that
we
would
limit
the
controversy
to
that
portion
of
the
land
south
of
the
pilot
cut
that
is
to
say
the
8.6
miles
as
shown
on
this
plan,
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
title
north
of
that
has
been
established
by
the
survey.
it's
been
unchallenged
for
12
years.
mr.
louis
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
it's
difficult
to
know
what's
involved
in
the
case
at
this
stage
of
course
--
mr.
louis
claiborne
well,
indeed,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
claiborne
there
is
--
there
remains
a
difficulty
at
california
--
mr.
louis
claiborne
i
regret
to
say
that
the
result
as
i
see
that
the
united
states
being
indispensable
as
to
whole
of
the
area.
the
united
states
not
having
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
as
to
the
northern
segment,
the
suit
could
go
forward
is
between
the
two
states
for
that
northern
segment.
and
that's
why
i
say
that
our
intervention
will
not
only
limit,
our
participation
and
our
title,
but
limit
the
law
suit
to
the
portion
below
the
cut.
now
if
the
principles
of
what
california
seeks
to
elaborate
by
the
use
of
this
action
and
they
haven't
explained
what
they
mean
by
that.
we
for
our
part
conceived
that
this
whole
bed
having
been
dried
by
artificial
creation
of
a
cut
is
governed
by
the
rules
of
revulsion
that
one
half
of
it
belongs
to
each
of
the
two
states.
mr.
louis
claiborne
i
think
in
this
instance
they're
common
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
claiborne
there
is
precedent
mr.
justice
rehnquist
for
this
granting
leave
subject
to
an
undertaking
by
the
united
states,
which
i
now
give
to
intervene
within
a
specific
period
of
time
so
as
to
allow
the
suit
to
go
forward.
mr.
louis
claiborne
no
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
think
he
would
properly
be
instructed
to
oppose
or
simply
to
plaintiff
to
make
no
appearance.
mr.
louis
claiborne
i
think
he
can
by
way
of
intervention
certainly
if
there
were
jurisdiction
--
mr.
louis
claiborne
if
there
were
jurisdiction
otherwise?
mr.
louis
claiborne
well,
i'm
perhaps
was
indulging
of
on
assumption
hypothetical
that
i
shouldn't
have
the
answer
of
course
is
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
any
state
court.
we
say
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
any
court,
but
this
court
and
accordingly,
of
course,
he
should
oppose
and
not
to
intervene,
but
it's
a
matter
of
who
can
waive
sovereign
immunity
that
problem
doesn't
arise
any
differently
in
a
state
court
and
it
does
in
a
federal
court
and
leave
can
be
given.
mr.
louis
claiborne
it
might
be
more
respectful
to
the
court,
mr.
justice
brennan
to
appear
for
the
purpose
of
opposing
--
mr.
louis
claiborne
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice
and
it
would
be
wasteful
of
judicial
resource.
mr.
louis
claiborne
safe
thing
to
do.
mr.
louis
claiborne
there
is
got
to
be
a
--
mr.
louis
claiborne
exactly
so.
mr.
louis
claiborne
mr.
justice
white
i
don't
think
1346
therefore
to
be
read
in
saying
that
the
government's
title
can
only
be
tried
in
a
district
court.
it
simply
that
the
congressional
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
is
by
inadvertence
we
assume
limited
to
that
court.
mr.
louis
claiborne
indeed
and
i
can
get
around
those
words,
but
i
don't.
mr.
louis
claiborne
but
this
would
not
know
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
claiborne
i
don't
think
1346
deprives
the
state
court
any
more
than,
it's
only
suits
under
2409
that
limited
to
the
district
court.
a
suit
in
this
court
is
not
a
suit
under
2409
and
accordingly
it
may
proceed
in
this
court
as
many
such
cases
have
in
years
before.
mr.
chief
justice
perhaps
because
of
what
we
said
in
our
brief
i
should
add
this
one
word
with
respect
to
our
conclusion
our
submission
with
respect
to
the
disposition
of
the
case.
we
had
said
in
may
that
perhaps
the
court
order
hold
this
motion
or
deny
it
without
prejudice
to
re-filing.
time
has
passed.
i'm
going
to
say
that
the
united
states
has
done
very
little
about
way
of
attempting
to
investigate
or
negotiate
a
settlement.
so
far
as
i'm
aware
of
arizona
has
done
no
more
and
accordingly
at
this
late
date
it
would
be
our
submission
that
california
is
entitled
now
to
have
it's
title
tried
and
we
would
accordingly
withdraw
suggestion
of
postponing
action
and
urge
this
court
to
grant
the
motion
with
the
undertaking
of
the
united
states
that
we
did
intervene
within
180
days
so
as
to
allow
it's
title
south
of
the
party
cut
to
be
the
final
result.
mr.
louis
claiborne
because
an
action
in
which
the
united
states
is
plaintiff
or
intervener
is
not
an
action
which
is
governed
by
2409,
2409
simply
waived
the
statute,
when
the
united
state
is
neither
plaintiff
nor
intervener.
mr.
louis
claiborne
well,
if
the
court
mr.
justice
steven
withhold
that
the
united
states
can
be
suit
in
this
court
of
because
2409
has
waived
sovereignty
of
this
court
as
well
as
the
district
court
then
the
only
thing
that
prevents
that
is
the
word
exclusive
in
1346
(f)
and
if
we
construe
exclusive
is
just
excludes
state
court's
jurisdiction
had
all
the
problems
solved.
all
the
problems
with
respect
to
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
claiborne
i
may
say
that
we
can
think
of
no
good
reason
while
the
government
ought
to
be
subject
to
suit
on
its
title
in
a
district
court
and
not
in
this
court.
we
cannot
suppose
that
congress
was
that
solicitors
of
the
solicitor
general.
now
it
may
have
been
solicitors
of
this
court's
burdens,
but
there
isn't
the
slightest
indication
of
that
in
the
legislative
history.
we
must
assume
that
they
simply
overlooked
that
such
suits
bringing
into
play
the
title
of
the
united
states
did
occasionally
when
states
were
involved
arise
originally
in
this
court.
whether
this
court
is
free
to
remedy
that
omission
by
congress
is
the
question.
mr.
louis
claiborne
that
is
entirely
right.
