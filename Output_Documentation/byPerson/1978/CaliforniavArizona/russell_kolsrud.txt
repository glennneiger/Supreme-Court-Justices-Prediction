mr.
russell
kolsrud
yes
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
initially
discuss
a
question
and
answer
post
by
the
solicitor
general
which
is
essence
of
this
action
and
that
is
must
this
case
be
heard
only
before
this
court
and
arizona's
positions
is
not
it
must
not.
i
think
the
simplest
answer
to
this
case
is
to
recognize
that
1346(f)
can
be
read
as
a
grant
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
by
congress
to
the
district
courts
regardless
of
the
parties.
this
has
been
done,
this
sort
of
approach
has
been
taken
prior
to
1948
when
the
judicial
court
stated
that
cases
that
begin
in
which
a
state
was
a
party
had
be
brought
before
the
united
states
supreme
court.
that
post
quite
a
few
problems
in
cases
where
the
united
states
brought
an
action
against
the
state
and
the
only
jurisdiction
was
this
court.
there
were
many
at
places
for
example,
in
the
safety
appliance
act
in
u.s.
versus
california
this
court
stated
that,
that
particular
legislation
was
actually
a
grant
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
actions
by
united
states
against
a
state,
so
that
the
district
court
could
in
fact
hear
that
case.
the
same
can
be
done
right
here
in
this
action.
any
case
that
is
brought
any
case
with
the
united
states
has
title
to
property
that
is
brought
by
any
person,
the
district
court
should
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case
regardless
who
the
parties
are,
that
would
be
a
grant
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
would
also
permit
this
court
to
allow
those
types
of
cases
to
go
elsewhere.
the
actual
essence
of
this
case
is
whether
the
language
in
1251(a)(1)
means
exactly
what
it
says,
it
says
that
jurisdiction
must
be
exclusive
in
all
controversies
between
two
or
more
states.
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
has
been
variously
interpreted
since
1789
of
the
date
of
the
first
judiciary
act.
recently
this
court
has
implied
if
not
stated
indicted
that
there
is
an
element
of
discretion
in
the
interpretation
of
1251(a)(1).
the
most
noteworthy
is
the
recent
decision
in
1976
of
arizona
against
new
mexico.
in
that
case
this
court
stated
that
it
should
interrupt
1251(a)(1)
in
the
same
manner
that
the
court
would
interrupt
article
3
section
(2)
clause
(2)
of
the
constitution,
which
is
the
original
jurisdiction,
grant
of
power
in
the
constitution.
now
if
this
is
correct
that
means
that
there
is
some
discretion
in
1251(a)(1)
and
if
that's
true,
then
the
only,
the
only
question
before
the
court
right
now.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
discretion
to
here
i
think
that
the
word
were
that
this
court
would
exercise
its
original
jurisdiction
only
in
appropriate
cases,
so
the
question
is,
is
this
an
appropriate
case?
mr.
russell
kolsrud
that
was
one
aspect
of
the
case,
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
stevens
indicated
that,
however
i
think
the
court's
primarily
concern
was
that
arizona
was
actually
the
issues
presented
by
arizona
were
actually
being
tried
in
a
separate
lawsuit
in
new
mexico
by
sort
of
a
project
and
other
private
citizens,
although
arizona
was
not
involved
in
that
case,
the
issues
themselves
were
being
adjudicated
in
new
mexico.
so
it
was
somewhat
different
in
that.
the
point
is,
is
this
an
appropriate
case
for
this
court.
we
think
not.
the
nature
of
this
case
it's
a
quite
title
action.
it
does
not
involve
the
larger
issues
of
jurisdiction,
doesn't
involve
problems
of
a
state's
sovereign
powers
to
regulate
the
laws
within
its
own
boundaries.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
it's
not
a
boundary
dispute
at
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
merely
a
question
of
who
owns,
where
do
you
draw
the
lines
between
two
land
owners
in
california,
it's
factual.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
we
think
california
can
and
should
sue
both
arizona
and
the
united
states
in
district
court
in
california.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
well,
sovereign
immunity
on
part
of
united
states
has
helped
in
waive,
presume
to
2409a
--
arizona.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
yes.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
it
is
within
the
exclusive
jurisdictional
of
this
court
under
1251a1
question
is,
is
there
way
to
get
around
that
and
put
this
case.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
yes
--
mr.
russell
kolsrud
to
hear
the
case
we
have
controversy
between
two
states.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
okay,
the
power
of
the
district
court,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
principles
behind
article
three.
the
district
court
has
a
power
to
adjudicate
controversies
between
states
regardless
of
the
subject
matter.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
1251a1,
referring
to.
that
statute.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
yes.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
well
our
argument
is
it
is
we
can
read
the
statute,
we
know
what
it
says,
our
position
is
that
the
reasoning
and
the
policies
the
principles
behind
the
idea
of
a
state
having
to
be
sued
only
in
the
united
state
supreme
court
don't
apply
here.
therefore
we
have,
we
would
prefer
everybody
agrees
in
the
district
court.
california
would
like
to
be
there,
united
states
will
like
to
be
there,
arizona
would
like
to
be
there.
the
only
impairment
is
that
language
of
1251.
this
court
has
in
numerous
cases,
i
think
in
the
most,
one
of
the
most
the
reason
is
the
ohio
versus
wyandotte
chemicals
case
in
401
us,
now
although
that
case
involved
only
a
dispute
by
the
state
of
ohio
against
citizens
of
another
state.
nevertheless
the
reasoning
given
by
this
court
for
declining
jurisdiction
is
relevant
to
this
case.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
yes
that's
true.
but
justice
harley
went
through
some
substantial
about
of
reasoning
and
policy
arguments
behind
the
article
3
grant
of
jurisdiction
discussing
first
of
all
the
need
for
discussion
in
this
court
to
decline
to
accept
various
cases
within
the
original
jurisdiction
and
secondly
the
reasons
that
a
state
as
a
plant
has
the
right
and
authority
to
bring
any
case
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
well
the
subsequent
opinion
in
illinois
versus
milwaukie,
the
result
i
think
it
is
a
very
consisting
yes.
and
actually
some
of
the
language
in
illinois
versus
milwaukie
would
support
the
idea
that
a
state
such
is
arizona
couldn't
waive
whatever
protection
1251a1
is
supposedly
affording
arizona
so
that
we
could
intervene
and
have
the
issues
the
adjudicated
in
the
district
court.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
the
quite
title
action
in
california,
that's
the
--
generally
speaking
the
law
of
the
state
or
the
locality
would
be
controlling
as
far
as
local
--
as
property
law
is
concerned.
so
in
california
the
local
law
of
california
generally
would
be
applied.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
well
those
i
would
think
as
well
would
be
governed
by
local
law.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
yes
state
law.
although
that
itself
is
another
issue,
there
are
some
problems
that
we
have
with
that
as
well.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
yeah
and
the
judges
in
the
district
to
california
certainly
handle
quite
few
quite
federal
actions
and
are
quite
confident
to
handle
that
sort
of
a
problem
which
is
one
of
the
policy
reasons
under
constitution
that
a
state
should
not
have
to
go
anywhere
but
united
states
supreme
court
to
adjudicate
whatever
cases
they
may
have
and
that
onetime
was
that
no
other
court
was
confident
to
handle
the
problem.
in
this
instance
i
think
the
factual
problems
that
we
have
within
cases
primarily
factual,
it
can
be
adjudicated
in
district
court.
now
arizona
has
also
we
have
argued
that,
that
we
can
waive
whatever
protection
there
is
under
1251a1.
the
analysis
and
reasons
for
that
argument
are
the
same
as
for
there
is
--
as
the
reason
that
this
court
has.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
discretion
to
decline
to
hear
the
case.
as
a
defendant
the
constitution
was
to
protect,
the
idea
was
to
protect
the
state
from
compulsory
process,
the
state's
prestige
dignity
was
such
that
should
not
be
compelled
to
be
sued
anywhere
but
in
the
united
state
supreme
court.
well
on
this
instance
what
was
actually
meant
to
be
a
favor
is
a
burden
as
a
sovereign
we
should
be
able
to
submit
ourselves
in
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
to
have
the
issue
decide,
so
long
as
the
court
has
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
this
case
it
does.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
yeah,
1251.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
well
we
cannot
confer
jurisdiction
we
think
the
reasons
for
that
are,
do
not
apply
here
plus
there
is
question
whether
the
1251a1
actually
itself
would
bar
the
sued
in
district
court.
if
you
look
at
the
constitution,
in
section
2
it
states
that
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
state
shall
extend
to
first
of
all,
all
cases
in
law
and
equity
arising
out
of
the
constitution
and
statutes
and
also
all
cases
of
maritime
and
admiralty
jurisdiction,
in
other
words
cases
based
upon
the
cause
of
the
subject
matter.
secondly
article
2
or
article
3
sections
two
states
that
judicial
power
extends
to
controversies
between
two
or
more
states.
and
then
in
the
next
class
which
is
the
grant
of
original
jurisdiction.
the
constitution
states
that
in
all
cases
in
which
the
state
shall
be
a
party,
the
supreme
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction.
that
can
be
read
and
reasonably
read
to
mean
that
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
extends
only
to
controversy
between
states
that
involve
cases
the
subject
matter
of
which
are
either
under
the
constitution
involving
questions
of
federal
law
or
the
other
cases
maritime
and
admiralty.
this
case
doesn't
fall
under
that.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
yes.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
that
would
now
be
in
consistent
because
i
had
stated
that,
i
believe
the
idea
that
a,
the
court
should
be
opened
to
ambassadors
and
states
that
would
not
be
foreclosed,
just
may
not
be
exclusive.
the
exclusivity
idea
came
from
congress
in
first
judiciary
act.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
i
don't
understand.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
the
congress
has
prevented
from
making
an
exclusive.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
yeah
that
could
be,
that
has
been
--
that
has
been
argued
but
has
been
rejected.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
my
argument
that
i'm
just
making
is
just,
this
is
not
a
case
the
subject
matter
of
which
arises
under
the
constitution.
although
it's
a
controversy
between
two
states
it
is
not
a
case
that
is
--
arises
under
the
constitution
or
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
yeah,
that
would
--
it
would
be
contrary
to
ames
to
the
extent
that
it
would
exclude
something
other
than
a
case
arising
under
the
constitution.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
yeah,
that's
another
problem
with
that
argument,
yeah.
and
the
boundary
dispute
is,
it
could
possibly
be
argued
to
be
a
case
arising
under
the
statutes
of
the
united
states.
i
realize
that
is,
it's
not
--
hasn't
been
adhered
to
before,
but
it
is
a
sort
of
a
problem
that
that
has
to
be
looked
at
now
in
this
case
especially.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
yes,
when
congress
passes
the
admission
statutes,
so
that
could
be
read
as
the
case
under
the
statutes
of
the
united
states.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
into
the
accident.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
we
certainly
it
could
because
it
would
be
a
controversy
between
two
states
although
the
act
itself
it
would
be
well
under
i
wonder
what
postulated
a
moment
ago
wouldn't
be,
because
it
would
not
be
a
case
of
rising
under
the
constitution
or
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
i
realize
if
that
argument
has
some
problems.
mr.
russell
kolsrud
well,
if
you
take
the
words
literally
controversies
between
the
two
states
that
would
definitely
be
a
controversy
between
two
states.
although
that
the
constitution
doesn't
really
say
that
either,
the
constitution
states
that
the
judicial
power
shall
extent
to
controversies
between
two
states.
not
all
controversy
between
states,
it
doesn't
exclude
anybody,
but
it
doesn't
include
them
all
either.
this
sort
of
a
case
ought
not
be
here.
it's
a
factual
case,
there
are
not
critical
sovereign
issues
and
that
itself
could
be
an
issue.
what
exactly
we're
talking,
when
we're
talking
about
sovereign
lands,
here
california
says
they
are
sovereign
lands.
well,
there
is
an
argument
that
the
1966
compact
had
an
affect
on
that
and
it
may
not
be
plus
the
united
states
is
involved.
and
now
we
think
under
1346
f
that
is
a
grant
of
concurring
jurisdiction
at
the
very
least
and
if
it
is
then
every
case,
not
only
this
one,
but
every
case
where
there
is
a
controversy
between
two
states
and
the
united
states
is
defendant
can
go
to
the
district
court
and
that
will
happen
quite
often
in
this
litigation.
and
finally
i
would
like
to
make
one
more
point
on
this
continuing
jurisdiction,
point
that
california
wants
this
court
to
take.
there
is
no
controversy
right
now
on
the
remaining
aspect
of
this
rule.
the
only
controversy
there
is
right
now
is
a
davis
lake
study.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
unless
there
is
a
bona
fide
controversy,
a
case,
a
wrong,
some
right
that's
its
susceptible
with
judicial
determination
then
this
court
will
not
take
jurisdiction
of
it
because
there
is,
it's
not
justiciable
under
the
constitution.
so
thank
you
very
much.
