justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there's
no
question
i
gather
mr.
goodman
as
to
the
definition
of
the
lands
in
dispute,
is
it?
it's
only
if
the
ownership
of
those
lands?
you
can
put
on
a
map
exactly
what
lands
you're
talking
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
have
changed
the
boundaries
of
the
lands
and
disputes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
have
them
here,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
it
doesn't
help
me
too
much.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
depending
upon
what
you've
said
to
me
–
asked
me
earlier
as
to
the
navigability
of
1850
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
i'm
afraid
i
haven't
understand
it
fully
yet.
is
there
an
agreement
between
you,
the
united
states
and
arizona
that
you
can
draw
a
map
exactly
what
land
you
were
talking
about,
title
of
which
you
want
quited
(ph)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
just
answer
that
yes
or
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
an
argument
that
there
would
just
be
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
though
congress
has
said
there
shall
not
be.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
only
as
the
part
of
the
land.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
would
be
able
to
do
is
bring
in
this
court
both
the
state
and
united
states
as
to
all
the
lands
and
disputes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what's
the
segment
that
the
government
says
that
might
be
willing
to
consume?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
this
by
the
--
i
mean
you
don't
mean
by
the
--
by
the
constitution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
congress
said
that
two
states
could
litigate
in
the
district
court,
they
could.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
part
of
this,
suppose
if
we
say
yes.
the
fight
is
between
the
states
is
here
what
california
wants
to
bring
a
suit
against
the
united
states
in
the
district
court
it's
free
to
do
that
and
then
we,
the
point
is
the
master
–
the
district
judge
is
going
to
decide
district
court
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
would
be,
he
would
wearing
a
hat
with
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
special
master
he
would
be
wearing
his
district
court
hat
on
the.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sure,
so
what.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
be
aware,
you
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
