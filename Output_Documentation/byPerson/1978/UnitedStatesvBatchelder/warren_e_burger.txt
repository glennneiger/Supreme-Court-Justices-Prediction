chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
justice
stewart.
we’ll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
united
states
against
batchelder.
mr.
levander,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that’s
analogous
to
the
discretion
of
the
prosecutor
whether
he
should
charge
a
first-degree
murder
for
example
or
second
degree
murder
or
manslaughter,
or
is
there
an
alternative?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
bellows.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
mr.
bellows,
a
prosecutor
faced
with
the
decision
before
any
charges
made
would
be,
or
i’ll
put
it
to
you
as
a
question.
would
he
be
entitled
to
take
into
account
that
the
particular
individual
who
had
a
prior
murder
conviction,
and
therefore
so
select
the
higher
of
the
two
penalty
statutes
on
that
ground?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
that’s
within
discretion
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
higher
is
just
surplusage
then.
it’s
a
nullity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
the
consequence
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
here,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
mr.
bellows,
is
this
really
fundamentally
much
different
from
the
inconsistent
verdicts
that
juries
sometimes
render
in
which
we
--
the
courts
have
said
that
inconsistent
verdicts
are
an
inherent
part
of
the
system?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
only
because
the
courts
have
said
they’re
entitled
to
it
though.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
bellows.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
levander?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
