there’s
also
a
difference
is,
unless
i
misunderstand
it
that
the
elements
of
the
offense
at
least
with
respect
to
this
defendant
were
exactly
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
with
respect
to
other
defendants,
they
might
not
have
--

again
in
this
case,
it
was
stipulated
that
the
firearm
had
traveled
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
potter
stewart
so
with
respect
with
this
defendant,
the
elements
are
precisely
the
same,
aren’t
they,
unlike
a
first
and
second-degree
murder
or
unlike
the
bordenkircher
against
hayes
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
or
was
there
a
recidivist
statute,
as
i
remember
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.

mr.
levander,
as
we
all
know,
there
has
been
kicking
around
the
congress
for
quite
a
while
now.
a
proposed
basic
wholesale
revision
of
the
federal
criminal
code,
would
that
bill
if
it’s
ever
enacted
eliminate
all
these
overlaps
and
duplications
or
many
of
them?
justice
potter
stewart
an
astute
prosecutor
could
do
it
at
least
as
well,
and
that’s
the
point,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
sentence
actually
imposed
--
the
punishment
actually
imposed
by
the
district
judge
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
no
fine?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
then
you
would
agree
it
didn’t.
