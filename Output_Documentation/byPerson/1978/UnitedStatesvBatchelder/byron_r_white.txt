well,
i
suppose
the
prosecutor
has
some
discretion
in
choosing
whether
to
prosecute
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
this
any
worse
in
degree?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
say
“i’ll
charge
you
mr.
a
but
i’m
not
going
to
charge
mr.
b.”
justice
byron
r.
white
something
wrong
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white

me
go

your
district
of
columbia

i
think
you
said
that
he
was
convicted
under
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
he
then
of
course
sentenced
under
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
the
sentences
concurrent
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
concurrent.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
rule
of
lenity
and
held
it
to
two
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do?
