justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
assume
that
in
any
comprehensive
criminal
code
in
astute
defendant
could
find
some
set
of
facts
which
would
violate
more
than
one
provision
of
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
are
you
suggesting
there’s
something
constitutionally
infirm
about
the
provision
about
someone
discharged
from
the
armed
forces
under
dishonorable
conditions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
your
client
--
is
there
any
claim
that
your
client
was
discharged
on
a
dishonorable
provision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
run
me
through
the
statute,
kind
of
a
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bellows,
could
you
express
--
explain
precisely
why
these
two
statutes
are
“void
for
vagueness
under
the
fifth
amendment”?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
five
years
is
perfectly
clear
to
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ten
years
is
perfectly
clear
to
me.
two
years
is
perfectly
clear
to
me.
there
maybe
a
considerable
overlap,
but
i
can’t
imagine
how
anyone
could
say
it
was
vague?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
if
your
argument
may
be
that
the
prosecutor
ought
not
to
be
entitled
to
be
given
that
discretion
by
congress.
but
i
don’t
see
anything
vague
about
the
discretion
is
given.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
there
ever
been
a
case
from
this
court
that
held
unconstitutional
a
statute
which
was
perfectly
clear
as
to
its
proscription
but
had
the
vagueness
problem
that
you
perceive
as
to
penalties?
