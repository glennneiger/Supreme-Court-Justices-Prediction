mr.
charles
a.
bellows
mr.
chief
justice,
and
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
section
922
(h)
is
a
very
severe
and
strict
statute.
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
how
long
the
interstate
commerce
took
place
as
in
our
case.
it
took
place
30
years
ago
prior
to
the
time
he
was
charged
with
the
crime.
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
whether
or
not
he
had
been
previously
convicted
of
an
offense
in
which
he
got
probation.
once
he’d
been
convicted
of
a
felony
then
he
comes
within
that
statute.
922
has
history
way
back
to
1933
where
practically
the
same
statute
was
involved
in
the
federal
arms
act.
later
on
1968,
it
was
included
in
the
omnibus
crime
bill.
and
it
covers
situation
where
a
defendant
is
under
indictment
as
well
as
being
convicted.
now,
this
may
create
a
problem,
its
remarkable
none
of
these
problems
has
surfaced
and
i
think
they’re
going
to
begin.
supposed
you
had
a
case
where
a
man
was
convicted
under
this
922
(h)
and
later
on
the
other
case
in
which
he
was
under
indictment,
he
was
acquitted,
what
do
you
do?
it
refers
to
fugitives.
it’s
a
fugitive
for
all
the
crime,
what
crimes
are
we
talking
about?
parking
tickets
may
be
a
crime.
abandoning
a
wife
may
be
a
crime.
you
have
another
provision
referring
to
those
adjudicated
as
mental
defectives.
i
can’t
imagine
charging
a
mental
defective
of
receiving
a
gun.
i’ve
never
heard
of
a
case
such
as
this.
but
this
was
intended,
this
statute,
this
omnibus
bill
is
intended
to
prevent
crime.
it
could’ve
been
a
very
simple
thing
to
have
said
among
other
things
knowing
under
the
age
of
21
or
24
years
of
age
shall
receive
a
gun,
or
sell
them.
i
think
that
kind
of
a
provision
would
really
have
brought
down
the
incidents
of
crime
in
america
but
congress
didn’t
want
to
go
that
far.
now
then
we
have
the
amendment
of
1202.
now
this
is
a
last
minute
amendment.
senator
long
came
along
with
an
amendment
and
he
was
asked
if
it
was
a
substitute
for
the
bill.
and
all
he
said
was
“they
did
a
good
job.”
meaning
the
committee
did
a
good
job.
“but
my
amendment
takes
nothing
from
the
bill.”
he
could’ve
very
well
have
said
“this
is
or
is
another
amendment.”
and
so
he
offers
it.
and
there’s
no
conversation.
there’s
no
debate
about
it
and
there
are
changes.
it
includes
those
convicted
of
crimes.
it
refers
to
those
that
charge
from
the
armed
services
under
dishonorable
conditions,
i
don’t
know
what
that
means.
someday
that
will
surface
if
this
remains
on
the
books.
and
it
refers
to
those
who
have
renowned
united
states
citizenship.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
i
say
these
provisions
are
so
ambiguous
that
serious
consideration
ought
to
be
given
by
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
both
of
them
are
constitutional.
in
addition
to
the
problem
we
have
here
of
the
two
statutes
where
in
the
same
crime
subjects
the
offender
to
one
sentence
of
two
years
and
the
other
of
five
years.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
no,
i’m
just
pointing
out
--
i’m
just
pointing
out
some
of
the
problems
--
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
--
that’s
eventually
have
in
both
of
these
statutes,
your
honor.
now
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
statutes
may
be
void
for
vagueness
and
that
they
violated
due
process
of
law
and
equal
protection
of
law,
and
applied
the
rule
of
lenity.
now
the
solicitor
general
talks
about
my
client
having
been
previously
convicted
of
the
offense
of
murder.
the
same
thing
would
apply
if
he
hadn’t
been
convicted
of
murder.
the
young
assistant
united
states
attorney
would
have
indicted
him
too
under
922
(h).
they
rarely
ever
used
the
1202
when
they
bring
in
the
file
on
a
man
who
sold
a
gun
or
bought
a
gun,
the
national
inclination
of
the
prosecutor
is
“i
will
draft
an
indictment
charging
him
under
the
more
severe
statute.”
there’s
a
recent
case
that
the
solicitor
general
called
my
attention
to
when
i
was
out
of
town,
one
decided
march
28th
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
where
the
defendant
was
found
guilty
of
the
two
statutes.
one
of
the
five-year
sentence
carrying
a
five-year
sentence,
one
of
the
two
years
and
they
applied
the
rule
of
lenity.
now,
the
government
argues
there’s
no
ambiguousness
about
the
statutes
and
here’s
an
extraordinary
example.
he
says
what’s
ambiguous
about
five
years?
what’s
ambiguous
about
two
years?
of
course
if
you
had
only
one
section,
one
statute
all
by
itself
it
is
ambiguous.
and
i
don’t
say
that
the
words
have
an
ambiguous
meaning
all
by
themselves.
but
when
you
put
them
to
in
together,
you
have
an
ambiguous
situation.
who
has
a
right
to
choose
where
it’s
the
same
offense,
not
two
different
offenses
or
one
included
in
the
other,
but
we
have
two
same
offenses.
should
a
prosecutor
have
the
right
to
assume
the
one
that
carries
the
harsher
sentence?
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
yes.
as
an
old-time
prosecutor,
i
did
many
times.
i
would
choose
a
particular
section
or
decide
to
prosecute
or
not
prosecute.
but
where
you
have
two
sections
both
relating
to
the
same
crime,
and
the
prosecutor
says
“you
mr.
a,
i’m
going
to
charge
with
the
section
which
calls
for
a
five-year
sentence.
and
you
mr.
b”
--
another
defendant
--
“i’ll
charge
you
under
the
section
which
carries
a
two-year
sentence.”
i
say
there’s
something
wrong
with
it.
it’s
--
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
you
could
say
that.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
yes
--
no
he
could
do
that.
he
could
say
i
won’t
charge
you.
but
if
he’s
going
to
use
that
section,
he’s
got
to
apply
it
equally
to
all
persons
charged
with
the
offense,
if
he’s
going
to
use
it.
not
the
one
charge
the
five-year
sentence
and
one
with
two-year
sentence.
has
he
the
right
to
do
it,
should
he
do
that?
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
under
both.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
they
were
concurrent.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
now,
the
solicitor
general
argues
that
congress
intended
that
section
922
governed
related
penalty.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
to
show
that
at
all.
the
solicitor
general
argues
at
the
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
rewrote
the
gun
laws.
they
didn’t
do
that.
what
they
did
was,
they
took
two
sections,
two
statutes
carrying
different
sentences
and
tried
to
give
meaning
to
them
rather
than
declare
them
unconstitutional.
they
tried
to
give
meaning
to
them
by
applying
the
rule
of
lenity.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
no,
when
you
have
the
same
offense
with
two
different
punishments.
we
have
the
same
crime
--
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
i
will
say
no,
your
honor.
that
where
they
have
the
same
offense
carrying
two
different
penalties,
two
different
sections,
one
allowing
for
a
five-year
sentence
one
of
two-year
sentence
--
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
well,
it’s
--
it
could
be
described
as
that.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
well,
the
court
said
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
this
“you
have
two
statutes
here
that
are
ambiguous
and
apparently
are
void
under
the
fifth
amendment
for
being
vague.”
and
rather
than
declare
them
unconstitutional,
they
said
“we’ll
give
meaning
to
it
by
applying
the
rule
of
lenity.”
and
--
or
bringing
the
lower
court
to
re-sentence
the
defendant
to
two
years.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
well,
vague
because
how
do
you
know
what
to
apply?
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
well,
but
when
you
have
two
statutes
that
cover
the
same
offense
of
the
purchaser
or
receipt
of
a
gun,
one
says
the
defendant
may
receive
up
to
five
years
and
the
one
receives
two
years.
the
vagueness
is
and
this
will
--
is
the
prosecutor
allowed
to
choose
when
we
have
two
different
sections.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
it’s
my
point
and
--
but
despite
the
court
of
appeals
that
that
makes
it
vague,
because
it
--
there
are
no
guidelines.
had
section
922
provided
that
where
a
man
who’d
been
previously
convicted
of
murder
or
rape
or
burglary,
he
shall
then
be
found
conviction.
the
sentence
may
run
up
to
five
years.
i
could
say
that
would
be
a
good
section.
but
there’s
no
such
showing.
there’s
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
that.
all
it
says
is
if
you
bought
the
gun
your
--
the
punishment
may
be
five
years.
and
so
it
is
vague,
where
who’s
to
choose
between
a
section
for
applying
the
five
years
and
the
two
years.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
no,
language
alone
if
you
had
just
922
alone
or
1202
alone,
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
when
you
put
together
two
of
them
that
conflict
with
each
other
then
i
say
there’s
a
vagueness.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
not
that
i’m
aware
of.
i
raise
the
question
before
this
court
that
in
as
much
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
are
serious
questions
about
the
constitutionality
of
both
of
these
sections
that
perhaps
they
ought
to
be
declared
unconstitutional.
i
see
no
great
harm
if
both
these
sections
were
declared
unconstitutional
and
congress
rewrote
them.
i
see
so
many
problems
that
could
arise,
eventually
from
all
these
--
from
prosecutions
under
both
statutes.
and
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
the
anomalies
that
are
here
proves
my
point
that
there
are
really
problems
with
both.
they
were
passed
in
a
hurry.
these
statutes
are
passed
fast
because
they
wanted
--
the
congress
wants
to
show
the
public
they’re
doing
something
to
prevent
crime.
but
even
though
far
enough
--
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
juries
are
entitled
to
that.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
yes.
and
in
our
present
case
for
instance,
upon
a
voir
dire
by
the
court
of
the
jurors
after
the
verdict.
they
wanted
to
know
what
the
defendant
was
convicted
of.
you
know,
it
gets
to
that.
this
is
a
tough
case
to
fight
in
the
courts
where
the
indictment
reaches
them
previously
convicted
of
a
felony,
sometimes
it
creeps
out
what
kind
of
a
felony
he
is.
and
jurors
they
can
talk
about
anything.
for
instance
in
this
case
the
record
will
show
they
wanted
to
know
why
that
mr.
bellows
come
down
the
(inaudible)
and
try
the
case.
so
they
can
talk
about
anything
they
want.
and
the
vagaries
of
a
jury
are
well
known.
they
can
do
as
they
please.
so
i
suggest
--
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
yes.
now
then
as
i
stated
that
we
have
submitted
the
court
to
consider
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
both
sections
could
be
declared
to
be
unconstitutional
and
it
would
be
no
great
loss
really,
because
it
could
be
rewritten
and
a
better
job
could
be
done.
finally,
we
suggest
that
the
amendment
by
senator
long
was
really
a
repeal
of
922
(h).
when
he
was
asked
“is
this
a
substitute”
he
didn’t
talk,
he
didn’t
answer
it
and
maybe
he
didn’t
want
to
start
a
rumpus.
but
he
just
said
“they
did
a
fine
job
and
it’ll
help.”
and
anyway,
it’s
not
they
weren’t
simultaneously
passed,
922
came
before
the
1202
(a),
922
(h)
came
way
back
in
1933,
so
it
wasn’t
something
new.
it’s
been
on
the
books
for
many
years.
and
there
was
an
established
rule
that
if
there
exist
a
conflict
in
the
same
act
the
last
provision
must
control.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
1202
(a)
could
be
considered
as
a
repeal
of
922
(h).
thank
you,
your
honors.
