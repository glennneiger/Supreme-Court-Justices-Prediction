mr.
andrew
j.
levander
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
government’s
petition
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
at
issue
is
the
interaction
of
the
sentencing
provisions
of
two
separate
titles
of
the
federal
gun
laws,
underlying
a
statutory
decision
of
the
court
below
of
constitutional
questions
implicating
the
scope
of
prosecutorial
discretion
and
validity
of
overlapping
criminal
statutes.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
there
is
no
question
here
concerning
the
correctness
of
respondent’s
conviction.
the
only
question
presented
concerns
respondent’s
sentence.
following
a
jury
trial
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
illinois,
respondent
was
convicted
of
one
count
of
violating
18
u.s.c.
922
(h).
as
this
court
concluded
in
barrett
against
united
states,
that
statute
unambiguously
prohibits
felons,
such
as
respondent,
from
receiving
a
firearm
that
has
traveled
in
interstate
commerce.
the
evidence
supporting
respondent’s
conviction
may
be
summarized
briefly.
on
july
31,
1975
respondent
sold
a
.38
caliber
pistol
to
a
federal
undercover
agent
for
$70.00.
at
this
time,
respondent
stated
to
the
agent
that
he
had
received
the
gun
following
a
burglary
in
st.
louis,
and
that
in
the
recent
past
he
had
had
and
transferred
other
firearms.
respondent
stipulated
to
the
facts
at
trial
that
the
pistol
had
traveled
in
interstate
commerce,
and
also
to
the
fact
that
he
had
been
previously
convicted
of
a
felony
in
1960.
the
district
court
sentenced
respondent
to
five
years
imprisonment
in
accordance
with
section
924
(a)
of
title
18.
that
statute
makes
clear
that
a
violation
of
section
922
(h)
is
punishable
by
up
to
five
years
imprisonment
and/or
$5,000.00
fine.
on
appeal,
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
respondent’s
conviction.
a
divided
panel
however,
concluded
that
despite
the
expressed
provisions
of
section
924
(a)
respondent
can
only
be
sentenced
up
to
two
years
in
prison.
the
court’s
conclusion
was
based
on
the
fact
that
respondent’s
receipt
of
a
firearm
also
violated
section
1202
(a)
of
title
18.
and
that
provision
carried
only
a
two-year
maximum
penalty
although
it
also
carried
a
larger
fine
that
is
$10,000.00.
the
court
of
appeals
felt
this
overlap
raise
serious
constitutional
questions.
its
decision,
however,
accorded
the
rest
on
statutory
grounds.
judge
mcmillan
dissented
from
the
court
of
appeals
decision
noting
that
the
overlap
between
the
five-year
statute
and
the
two-year
statute
are
very
common
among
criminal
statutes
in
title
18,
and
that
the
government
has
traditionally
had
the
discretion
to
pursue
a
defendant
under
any
of
applicable
statutes.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
think
it’s
very
analogous,
your
honor.
and
this
court
in
gregg
against
georgia
founded
that
that
discretion
to
actually
charge
first-degree
murder
or
not
to
charge
didn’t
violate
the
constitutional
rates,
constitutional
difficulties.
it
is
also
similar
to
the
discretion
of
this
court
upheld
in
bordenkircher
against
hayes.
that
is
the
discretion
of
the
prosecutor
to
--
in
plea
bargaining
to
add
various
counts
or
not
add
various
counts.
it
is
also
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
your
honor
i
don’t
think
that
is
--
i
think
that’s
the
court
of
appeals
conclusion.
i
don’t
think
that’s
true
if
one
looks
at
the
statutes
carefully.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
no
even
with
respect
to
a
convicted
felon,
there
is
a
difference
in
the
commerce
clause
element
between
these
two
statutes.
following
this
court’s
decisions
in
barrett,
bass
and
scarborough
there’s
a
difference
between
1202
(a)
which
allows
a
defendant
to
be
convicted
if
the
firearm
has
either
travelled
interstate
commerce
or
affected
interstate
commerce,
whereas,
section
922
(h),
the
five-year
statute,
the
firearm
must
have
traveled
interstate
commerce.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that’s
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well
if
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--
if,
right.
or
that’s
and
as
oyler,
as
well.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
there
is
--
there
are
several
decisions
of
this
court
in
which
if
one
looks
at
what
the
proof
of
the
government
is
in
terms
of
none
contested
elements
of
the
crime,
this
court
has
upheld
the
conviction
under
one
statute
or
another,
or
found
that
no
lesser
included
offense
was
necessary.
in
spies
and
in
bishop
and
those
series
of
tax
cases,
the
court
noted
that
even
if
congress
had
drafted
exactly
identical
statutes
that
might
be
unusual.
but
they
didn’t
indicate
in
the
least
that
those
kind
of
identical
statutes
would
be
unconstitutional.
and
in
those
cases,
the
defendant
claimed
that
it
was
unfair
or
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
lesser
included
offense
in
the
situation
in
which
there
was
a
felony
--
he
was
prosecuted
for
felony
but
his
exact
conduct
and
exact
elements
would
also
prove
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
it
might
eliminate
some,
however
section
1822
of
s.
1437,
that’s
the
current
destination
of
the
major
provision
of
title
18,
contains
both
the
equivalent
of
922
(h),
the
five-year
statute
and
1202,
and
also
continues
to
have
a
five-year
penalty
for
the
one
and
a
two-year
penalty
for
the
other.
although
the
fines
are
changed
because
under
the
revision,
with
my
understanding
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
all
felonies
are
punishable
by
certain
standard
fines.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
there
are
many
in
title
18,
as
we
indicate
in
the
brief
in
a
long
footnote,
there
are
just
numerous
sections
which
violate
--
which
are
overlapping
to
either
similar
or
100%.
for
instance
18
u.s.c.
1001,
which
is
the
false
statement
statute
overlaps
with
several
other
provisions
both
in
title
18
and
other
titles
concerning
false
statements
to
various
government
agencies
and
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that’s
correct
that
traditionally
the
prosecutors
had
that
discretion
and
a
discretion
to
choose
one
statute
or
another
is
no
greater
discretion
in
the
government’s
view
than
the
discretion
not
to
charge
at
all
or.
the
court’s
statutory
decision
which
was
basically
that
where
a
defendant’s
conduct
violates
both
a
two-year
--
the
two-year
provision
and
the
five-year
provision,
he
may
only
get
the
two-year
sentence,
was
based
on
three
maxims
of
statutory
construction,
principles
of
implied
repeal,
lenity
and
avoidance
of
constitutional
questions.
the
--
it
is
well-established
in
the
cases
of
this
court
that
implied
repeals
are
disfavored
in
the
law.
and
only
where
the
two
statutes
in
question
will
be
clearly
repugnant
to
one
another
will
this
court
hold
that
one
statute
has
impliedly
repealed
another.
however,
here
we
clearly
do
not
have
repugnant
statutes.
the
statutes
viewed
as
a
whole,
cover
very
different
grounds.
as
the
court
noted
in
bass,
the
two
statutes
cover
very
different
kinds
of
people.
for
instance,
in
the
five-year
statute,
fugitives
from
justice
and
addicts
are
covered.
and
in
the
two-year
statute,
you
have
illegal
aliens,
ex-citizens
and
other
groups
which
are
not
covered
in
the
five-year
statute.
moreover,
as
i
pointed
out
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
a
moment
ago,
the
commerce
clause
element
of
the
two
statutes
are
quite
different.
and
there
are
also
differences
in
the
conduct
which
is
prohibited.
the
five-year
statute
only
goes
to
receipt
of
a
firearm,
whereas
the
two-year
statute
goes
to
receipt,
transportation,
and
possession.
and
in
scarborough
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that’s
a
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
on
these
facts?
i
think
that
the
answer
would
probably
be
not,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
for
instance
in
the
eighth
circuit
recently
there
was
a
decision
called
white
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
recently,
in
which
the
defendant
was
convicted
on
both
receiving
under
922
(h).
and
he
was
also
convicted
of
transportation
under
1202.
and
in
that
sort
of
circumstance,
i
think
that
the
government
would
argue
and
did
argue
that
consecutive
punishment
would
be
possible.
not
only
are
implied
repeals
disfavored,
but
normally
one
would
think
that
implied
repeal
involves
two
statutes,
one
which
is
enacted
after
another.
here
however,
the
two
statutes,
the
five-year
statute
and
the
two-year
statute
were
enacted
at
the
same
time.
one
is
title
iv
and
one
is
--
the
other
is
title
vii
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
act,
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968.
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
understand
how
it’s
possible
that
two
statutes
which
are
enacted
at
the
same
time
could
possibly
be
an
implied
repeal
of
one
or
the
other.
and
indeed,
the
same
congress
which
enacted
both
statutes
shortly
thereafter
reenacted
both
statutes
with
a
different
penalties
in
the
gun
control
act
of
1968.
and
at
that
time
the
senate
specifically
considered
raising
the
five-year
statute
to
be
a
ten-year
maximum
penalty,
although
this
provision
was
later
deleted
in
conference.
but
congress
was
clearly
aware
of
the
two
statutes,
treated
them
as
separate
statutes
and
enacted
and
reenacted
them,
and
obviously
understood
them
to
be
self-fluctuating
and
separate
gun
titles.
the
second
principle
of
statutory
interpretation
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
is
the
principle
of
lenity.
and
it
is
true
that
where
a
criminal
statute
is
ambiguous,
this
court
has
often
stated
that
it
would
be
construed
to
benefit
the
defendant.
here
however,
we
submit
there
is
no
ambiguity
whatsoever.
there’s
certainly
no
ambiguity
as
the
conduct
prohibited,
the
court
so
stated
in
barrett.
and
as
to
the
penalty,
924
(a)
without
exception
provides
whoever
violates
the
provision
of
this
chapter
in
section
924
(h),
the
five-year
statute
is
part
of
that
chapter,
maybe
punishable
by
up
to
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
$5,000.00
fine.
there
is
no
cross-reference
or
any
indication
of
an
exception
in
that
statute.
section
1202,
the
two-year
statute
on
the
other
hand
both
sets
out
prohibited
conduct
and
immediately
after
says
that
anyone
who
does
this
conduct
shall
be
punished
by
up
to
two
years
imprisonment
and
a
maximum
$10,000.00
fine.
and
it
also
is
very
unambiguous
and
it
permits
structure
in
its
language,
it
appears
to
be
just
a
self-contained
statute.
the
penalty
applies
just
to
those
violations
that
are
set
forth
in
the
two-year
statute,
and
there’s
no
cross-reference
in
that
statute
to
the
five-year
statute.
moreover,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
there
is
no
ambiguity
here,
and
that
congress
clearly
intended
that
the
five-year
statute
and
the
two-year
statutes
be
prosecuted
and
enforced
separately.
the
two-year
statute
was
added
as
an
amendment
in
the
legislative
process
to
the
omnibus
crime
control
act,
and
senator
long
was
the
sponsor
of
the
two-year
statute.
and
he
stated
that
this
statute
is
not
intended
to
take
anything
from
but
rather
to
add
to
“the
existing
penalties
and
provisions”
of
title
iv
that
is
the
five-year
statute.
and
again
the
legislative
history
of
the
gun
control
act
which
is
the
second
act
that
was
passed
by
congress
in
1968
concerning
these
matters
shows
that
congress
treated
the
two
statutes
separately
in
separate
titles
of
the
gun
control
act.
it
viewed
them
as
separate
parts.
the
language
suggested
they’re
separate
parts.
finally,
i
would
note
that
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
allowing
a
defendant
to
be
sentenced
to
five
years
when
his
conduct
also
violated
a
two-year
statute
would
be
an
absurd
result
or
an
unfair
result.
but
i
think
that
this
court
of
appeals
decision
and
analysis
may
create
the
difficult
results.
for
example,
the
court
of
appeals
in
footnote
5
of
its
decision
refused
to
address
the
question
which
fine
provision
of
the
two
statutes
would
apply.
now
the
five-year
penalty
statute
carries
the
$5,000.00
fine.
the
two-year
statute
carries
a
$10,000.00
fine.
if
it
is
the
doctrine
of
implied
repeal
that
is
applicable,
well
then
seemingly,
the
$10,000.00
greater
fine
that’s
found
in
the
two-year
statute
would
be
the
applicable
one.
if
it
is
the
doctrine
of
lenity
that’s
controlling,
then
in
seemingly
it
would
be
the
$5,000.00
fine
that’s
found
in
the
five-year
statute.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
it
was
a
five-year
--
it
was
a
five-year
penalty,
the
maximum.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
and
no
fine.
that’s
why
the
court
it
didn’t
have
to
reach
the
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that’s
correct.
but
the
fact
that
it
didn’t
indicates
--
i
mean
that
that
question
raises
some
serious
problems.
i
think
another
absurd
result
that
might
result
from
this
decision
is
that
section
922
(h)
(1)
under
which
the
respondent
was
prosecuted
and
convicted
applies
not
only
to
those
who
have
been
convicted
of
a
felony
but
those
who
are
under
indictment
for
a
felony.
there
is
no
such
equivalent
provision
in
the
two-year
statute,
therefore
a
defendant
who
was
under
indictment
at
the
time
that
he
received
the
firearm
could
still
get
the
five-year
penalty.
but
a
day
later,
when
he
was
convicted
his
penalty,
the
penalty
--
maximum
penalty
would
be
limited
to
two
years
under
the
court
of
appeals
analysis.
the
third
maxim
that
the
court
relied
on
is
the
maxim
that
where
possible,
the
court
should
construe
a
statute
to
avoid
a
serious
constitutional
question.
in
the
government’s
view,
there
are
no
serious
constitutional
questions
here,
but
in
any
event,
that
the
avoidance
of
a
constitutional
question
is
only
possible
where
the
statutes
--
the
statutes
in
question
may
be
fairly
read
in
alternative
fashions.
here,
there’s
just,
as
i
said
in
regard
to
the
maxim
of
lenity,
there’s
no
ambiguity.
there’s
only
one
reading
that’s
fairly
possible.
and
as
this
court
held
in
swain
against
presley
and
that
sort
of
a
situation,
the
court
cannot
avoid
the
constitutional
question
and
must
face
it.
turning
to
the
question
of
the
constitutional
--
underlying
constitutional
questions,
as
i’ve
indicated,
the
two
statutes
although
in
application
in
this
case
have
similar
proof
involved.
they
are
very
different,
the
scope
of
the
two
statutes,
the
person’s
activities
and
the
commerce
clause
element
are
very
different.
and
indeed
as
this
court
recognized
both
in
bass
and
in
scarborough,
it
may
well
have
been
that
congress
thought
that
it
was
enacting
in
a
two-year
statute,
a
statute
along
the
lines
of
perez.
that
is
a
statute
not
requiring
individualized
proof
of
commerce
clause
jurisdiction
in
each
and
every
case.
and
in
so
far
as
the
congress
thought
that
it
was
doing
that,
the
two
statutes
were
very
much
different
as
to
their
commerce
clause
nexus.
after
the
decisions
in
bass,
barrett
and
scarborough
they
are
still
different
although
the
gap
is
not
quite
as
great.
we
mentioned
before
that
the
government
has
always
suggested
and
this
court
has
always
followed
that
the
prosecutor
has
large
discretion
in
charging
and
in
choosing
the
statute
under
which
to
prosecute
or
not
prosecute
a
defendant.
in
part
that
that
discretion
is
based
on
the
constitution
itself,
article
2,
section
3
of
the
constitution
and
the
doctrine
of
the
separation
of
powers.
the
only
limitation
on
that
prosecutorial
discretion
as
indicated
in
bordenkircher
and
in
oyler
is
where
the
prosecutor
exercises
his
discretion
on
the
basis
of
arbitrary
or
unconstitutional
factors,
such
as
race
or
religion
or
gender
or
something
of
that
nature.
there’s
no
assertion
in
this
case
that
there
--
that
the
prosecution
was
based
on
any
of
those
factors.
and
indeed,
looking
at
the
record
one
can
well
imagine
why
the
prosecutor
chose
to
pursue
the
respondent
under
the
five-year
statute.
he
had
been
convicted
of
murder
in
1960.
he
had
a
very
long
record
before
then
and
some
20
other
prior
convictions
of
some
sort
or
other,
including
i
think
a
felony
conviction
for
writing
in
1952.
and
shortly
after
he’d
been
released
from
prison
following
his
murder
conviction,
he
was
proceeding
to
apparently
sell
guns
and
trading
guns,
not
only
the
gun
in
question
but
apparently
he
mentioned
that
he
had
had
other
guns
in
the
recent
past
and
had
transferred
those
as
well.
so
the
question
becomes
where
could
possibly
statutes
which
have
different
elements
be
unconstitutional
where
they
are
clear.
and
here,
the
conduct
prohibited
is
clear,
and
the
penalty
provided
for
each
of
the
two
statutes
is
quite
clear
and
there’s
no
exception
made
in
under
either
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondent
suggest
that
the
two
statutes
are
identical.
and
we
would
submit
that
even
where
the
statutes
were
identical,
there
would
be
unconstitutional
violation.
as
long
as
it
was
clear
that
congress
intended
there
would
be
separate
statutes.
this
court
has
indicated
in
bell
and
in
other
cases
that
the
major
limitation
on
constitutional
limitation
on
congress’
power
to
enact
separate
statutes
with
different
penalties
or
on
to
set
the
penalties
for
a
criminal
violation
is
the
eighth
amendment.
and
there’s
certainly
no
claim
here
that
these
statutes
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
it
is
arguable
--
i
suppose
that
if
you
have
identical
statutes
that
there
might
be
some
sort
of
due
process
violation
in
terms
of
notice.
however,
the
due
process
notice
line
of
cases
seems
to
focus
mainly
on
the
conduct
prohibited.
and
here
the
conduct
prohibited
is
very
clearly
prohibited.
it’s
prohibited
by
two
statutes
not
just
one
as
regards
with
respondent.
and
there
is
less
reason
for
the
criminal
law
to
be
so
precise
in
the
penalty
provision
in
the
sense
that
for
instance
the
kidnapping
statute
provides
that
the
defendant
who
is
convicted
of
kidnapping
may
be
punished
by
anywhere
from
zero
to
life
imprisonment.
so
it’s
clear
that
that
kind
of
--
and
that
statute
is
not
been
held
as
unconstitutional,
the
breadth
of
its
statutory
provisions.
here,
it’s
much
even
narrower
one.
it’s
from
zero
to
five
or
if
it’s
under
the
three-year
statute,
from
zero
to
two.
lastly,
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
no
unfairness
to
defendants
if
they’re
prosecuted
under
the
one
statute
or
the
other.
if
a
defendant’s
conduct
constitutes
some
horrible
acts
or
in
need
of
strict
punishment,
he
can
get
more
than
five
--
two
years
under
the
five-year
statute.
if
he
is
lucky
enough
to
have
been
charged
on
the
two-year
statute,
that’s
fortuitous
and
he
only
gets
the
maximum
two
years.
and
that
kind
of
fortuitous
mercy,
this
court
in
gregg
against
georgia
it
said
did
not
violate
the
constitution.
and
those
defendants
whose
conduct
is
punishable
by
less
than
two
years
will
receive
less
than
two
years
under
both
statutes.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
just
a
couple
quick
points
if
i
might,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
i
would
mention
that
although
section
922
(h)
has
its
origins
in
a
1933
statute,
the
federal
firearm
act,
the
statutes
are
very
different.
the
penalties
were
changed.
a
presumption
was
eliminated
that
was
in
one
statute
and
in
another.
and
the
statutes
were
radically
different
in
their
scope.
secondly,
respondent
suggests
that
senator
long
was
not
clear
as
to
what
he
said
when
he
introduced
the
bill.
however,
senator
dowd
asked
him
“do
i
correctly
understand
that
this
amendment
is
not
a
substitute
for
title
iv?”
answer,
“this
amendment
would
take
nothing
from
the
bill,
if
i
applaud
what
the
committee
did,
this
would
add
to
the
final
work
the
committee
did
in
this
area.”
and
lastly,
respondent
suggests
that
the
prosecutors
across
the
country,
federal
prosecutors
are
always
using
922
(h),
the
five-year
statute
as
opposed
to
the
two-year
statute.
however,
statistics
from
1977
and
1978
show
that
firearm
prosecution
is
brought
under
one
statute
or
the
other.
about
40%
were
brought
under
the
two-year
statute.
now,
i
don’t
know
exactly
how
many
of
those
cases
could
only
have
brought
--
been
brought
under
the
two-year
statute
because
of
the
commerce
clause
element,
but
i
suggest
that
the
statistics
indicate
that
the
prosecutors
are
exercising
their
discretion
in
accordance
with
the
factors
that
this
court
approved
in
a
footnote
in
lovasco
in
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
if
there
are
no
further
question.
