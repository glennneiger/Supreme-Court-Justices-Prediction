mr.
herbert
semmel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
a
simple
example
illustrates
the
discriminatory
effect
on
illegitimate
children
of
the
marriage
requirement
for
mother's
benefits.
if
we
have
a
wage
earner
who
lives
with
the
woman,
has
a
child
with
that
woman,
lives
with
and
supports
that
child
everyday
of
the
child's
life
until
the
wage
earner
dies,
but
has
never
married
the
mother,
that
family
unit
is
deprived
of
mother's
benefits
and
the
child
is
deprived
of
the
opportunity
for
the
care
of
the
mother
afforded
by
mother's
benefits.
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
have
a
wage
earner
who
marries
a
woman
and
while
she's
pregnant
deserts
her,
never
sees
the
child,
never
supports
the
child
and
dies,
that
family
unit
is
entitled
to
mother's
benefits
and
that
child
receives
a
benefit
of
a
care
of
the
mother
which
mother's
benefits
makes
possible.
the
distinction
between
the
two
groups
is
simply
that
in
one
case,
the
mother
and
the
father
married
and
that
the
other
case,
they
have
not
married.
and
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
statute
which
visits
the
sins
of
the
parents
on
the
child
by
depriving
the
child
of
a
benefit,
a
social
welfare
benefit,
merely
because
of
the
lack
of
marriage
of
the
parents.
and
the
bar
here
is
absolutely.
this
is
not
a
case
like
lucas
where
the
illegitimate
child
can
come
in
and
prove
dependency,
or
where
the
child
and
the
mother
could
come
in
and
prove
that
they
had
actually
been
supported
by
the
father
of
the
child
at
the
time
of
his
death.
mr.
herbert
semmel
that
is
almost
invariably
the
case
in
all
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
under
those
unusual
circumstances
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
well,
i'm
not
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
the
answer
is
yes
that
under
those
circumstances
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
the
wife
who
has
a
child
of
a
--
her
husband,
but
it's
not
around
would
receive
benefits.
mr.
herbert
semmel
the
line
is
drawn
illegitimacy
if
we
define
the
class
mr.
justice
white
which
is
the
class
is
children
living
--
the
general
classification
is
children
living
with
their
mother
which
encompasses
almost
all
children.
i
believe
only
yesterday,
mr.
justice
stevens
in
his
dissent
in
the
caban
case
noted
that
virtually
all
children
live
with
their
mothers.
the
example
what
you
pose
is
a
kind
of
an
exception
to
the
normal
living
pattern.
and
so,
the
general
classification
is
children
living
with
their
mothers,
and
then
all
illegitimate
children
are
barred
from
the
benefit
because
their
mothers
haven't
married
the
father.
all
legitimate
children
living
with
their
mothers
receive
the
benefits
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
the
statute
--
the
definition
of
a
class
in
some
respect
was
narrower
in
every
possible
application
of
the
statute.
but
in
every
illegitimacy
case
that
has
been
before
this
court
virtually
in
which
the
discrimination
has
been
stricken.
there
has
been
some
group
of
illegitimate
children
who
qualify
and
this
court
has
always
looked
at
the
class
by
comparing
legitimate
children
and
illegitimate
children
similarly
situated.
mr.
herbert
semmel
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
semmel
that
is
correct.
but
we
have
had
other
cases
in
this
court
in
which
some
illegitimate
children
were
not
excluded
from
benefits.
but
the
court
nevertheless
held
that
discrimination
between
legitimate
children
and
illegitimate
children
similarly
situated
was
unconstitutional.
in
the
webber
case
for
example,
involving
workers
compensation
benefits,
legitimate
children
and
acknowledge
illegitimate
children
receive
benefits.
other
illegitimate
children
did
not,
and
the
court
held
that
discrimination
was
unconstitutional.
in
the
jimenez
case,
we
had
legitimate
children
and
some
classes
of
illegitimate
children
receiving
benefits.
other
illegitimate
children
did
not.
and
again,
this
court
held
by
looking
at
illegitimate
children
and
legitimate
children
similarly
situated
that
there
was
an
unconstitutional
discrimination.
in
fact
in
every
case
involving
the
social
security
act,
there
are
always
some
illegitimate
children
who
receive
benefits
because
there's
a
provision
in
the
act
that
children
who
are
illegitimate
solely
because
of
a
defect
in
a
bonafide
marriage
between
their
parents
are
considered
legitimate.
so
that
we
always
have
some
illegitimate
children
receiving
benefits,
yet
this
court
in
two
different
situations
has
stricken
discrimination
against
illegitimate
children
in
the
social
security
act.
and
that's
true
in
almost
every
other
kind
of
case
in
which
this
court
is
found
discrimination
against
illegitimate
children.
there
had
been
some
--
in
some
case,
a
number
of
maybe
small,
in
others,
the
number
maybe
large,
in
which
some
illegitimate
children
have
gotten
the
benefits.
and
we
would
submit
that
here,
the
crucial
distinction
and
--
which
relates
this
entire
argument
of
the
government
on
the
likelihood
of
support.
if
the
court
examines
the
jimenez
case
on
the
hand
and
the
lucas
case
on
the
other
hand,
and
similarly
in
the
different
context
trimble
v.
gordon
on
one
hand
and
lalli
v.
lalli
on
the
hand.
the
distinction
is
the
absolute
bar
may
base
on
the
failure
of
the
mother
and
father
to
marry.
and
so,
if
this
was
the
statute
as
we
had
in
lucas
in
which
the
family
could
come
in
and
have
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
that
in
fact
there
was
support
for
the
family,
that
would
be
a
different
case
and
might
be
proper
and
constitutional
under
lucas.
because
what
lucas
and
jimenez
illustrate
is
that
the
likelihood
of
support
argument
sustains
differential
treatment
only
in
presuming
that
all
legitimate
children
are
supported,
but
requiring
an
additional
showing
by
illegitimate
children.
but
that
it
does
not
sustain
an
absolute
bar
to
illegitimate
children
and
in
a
particular
category,
those
living
with
their
mothers.
mr.
herbert
semmel
i
believe
that
that
is
the
holding
of
the
lucas
case.
mr.
herbert
semmel
we
would
not
concede
that
your
honor,
as
long
as
the
touchstone
was
illegitimacy.
that
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
your
honor,
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
the
pleadings
don't
allege
that
because
the
case
came
up
on
a
review
of
the
determination
of
the
social
security
administration
because
of
the
marriage
requirement,
any
question
of
support
became
irrelevant,
and
therefore
no
evidence
was
submitted
in
the
administrative
process.
and
none
would
have
been
relevant
had
it
been
offered.
but
we
would
submit
that,
not
only
isn't
there
any
empirical
evidence,
but
that
the
statutory
history
shows
that
congress
never
had
that
in
mind
at
all.
mr.
herbert
semmel
well,
i
think
there
two
answers
to
that.
one
is
that
the
statutory
history
shows
that
congress
was
irrational
in
the
sense
that
they
were
acting
out
of
an
intent
to
exclude
illegitimate
children
as
part
of
a
general
statutory
purpose
of
discrimination
against
illegitimate
children.
mr.
herbert
semmel
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
semmel
yes,
i
would
like
to
do
that
mr.
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
yes,
but
--
that
is
correct.
we
would
say
either
way,
the
statute
should
be
invalidated.
but
i
would
like
to
take
perhaps
the
remaining
moments
before
the
break
to
touch
on
that
question
of
the
intent
of
congress
here.
if
we
go
back
to
1939
in
the
congress
first
enacted
survivors
benefits,
the
original
social
security
act
was
simply
for
retirement,
and
that
in
1939,
survivor's
benefits
were
first
enacted.
at
that
time,
illegitimate
children
were
excluded,
children's
benefits
that
were
provided
or
provided
only
for
legitimate
children.
the
social
security
advisory
board
beginning
in
1940
expressed
itself
on
that
question,
pointed
to
the
inequities
and
urged
congress
to
correct
it.
it
wasn't
until
1965
that
congress
first
moved
to
make
some
change
in
the
total
exclusion
of
illegitimate
children.
but
even
in
1965
when
they
did
it,
they
surrounded
the
change
with
a
number
of
discriminatory
provisions.
one
of
them
was
a
provision
that
if
by
adding
illegitimate
children's
--
children's
benefits
to
the
total
package
on
the
wage
earners
account,
the
total
benefits
were
exceed
the
maximum
than
illegitimate
children
lost
all
their
benefits
first,
and
rather
than
dividing
it
proportionally
as
in
almost
any
other
case.
and
that
was
stricken
by
this
court
in
the
summary
affirmance
of
both
in
the
davis
and
griffin
cases.
the
second
kind
of
discrimination
was
before
this
court
in
the
jimenez
case
where
we
were
dealing
with
a
very
small
class
of
children
born
after
the
disability
of
their
father.
and
under
the
statute,
illegitimate
children
were
not
entitled
to
benefits
and
legitimate
children
were
entitled
to
benefits
and
this
court
found
that
that
was
unconstitutional.
and
by
congress
by
leaving
the
mother's
benefit
provision
with
a
marriage
requirement,
continue
the
discriminatory
effect
of
that
on
illegitimate
children.
that
went
back
to
1939
when
illegitimate
children
were
totally
excluded
from
the
statute,
and
i
made
sense
of
course
the
congress
to
say
with
use
the
term
widow
because
it
was
only
widows
and
legitimate
children
that
were
involved
in
the
benefit
package
at
all.
but
that
this
former
discrimination
carries
over
along
with
these
other
requirements.
and
again,
the
provision
in
the
act
that
says
when
legitimate
children
that
--
excuse
me,
when
illegitimate
children
are
illegitimate
only
by
reason
of
the
invalid
but
good
faith
marriage
of
the
parents,
they
are
deemed
legitimate.
and
the
mother
is
then
deemed
a
wife
under
the
same
circumstances.
that
again
i
think
indicates
that
what
we
had
was
a
general
statutory
scheme
of
hostility
to
children
because
of
the
failure
of
their
parents
to
marry.
and
that
part
of
that
has
been
removed
by
congress,
part
of
that
has
been
removed
by
this
court.
and
this
mother's
benefit
is
one
of
the
last
vestiges
of
that
scheme.
mr.
herbert
semmel
i
believe
that
was
during
the
--
i
don't
recall
the
date,
your
honor,
i
would
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
that
was
an
addition
to
the
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
--
the
illegitimate
children
and
so
on.
it
came
long
after
the
original
mother's
benefits.
mr.
herbert
semmel
the
original
widow.
originally,
it
was
solely
the
widow,
that
is
the
woman
who
is
married
to
the
wage
earner
at
his
death.
mr.
herbert
semmel
chief
justice,
i
was
advised
by
the
clerk
that
you
would
take
a
recess
at
this
time.
would
you
prefer
me
to
stop
now?
mr.
herbert
semmel
oh,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
semmel
i
see.
mr.
herbert
semmel
the
--
i
just
like
briefly
to
comment
on
the
wiesenfeld
case.
i
--
i
think
it
is
not
accurate
to
state
that
that
case
focused
on
the
husband.
mr.
herbert
semmel
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
the
holding
of
this
court
i
submit
was
very
clear
in
the
wiesenfeld
case
that
the
mother's
benefit
was
intended
to
benefit
the
child.
and
in
fact,
the
government
in
that
case
made
the
same
argument
that
they
asserted
here
that
this
was
essentially
spousal
support
and
it
was
proper
for
congress
to
distinguish
between
support
for
wives
were
normally
supported
by
their
husbands
as
contrasted
to
support
for
husbands
who
are
often
or
perhaps
more
often
than
not
supported
by
their
wives.
and
that
was
been
asserted
by
the
government
as
the
justification
for
the
classification
there.
and
the
court's
decision
finds
that
the
benefit
was
for
the
child
that
therefore
we
have
the
discrimination
based
on
sex
because
woman
workers
do
not
get
the
same
benefits
for
their
children
as
male
workers
would.
and
therefore,
there
was
implicit
rejection
of
the
notion
that
the
intent
of
the
statute
was
for
spousal
support.
now,
the
fact
that
a
marriage
requirement
is
used
in
statute
does
not
mean
that
there
is
no
either
intended
or
effect
discrimination
against
illegitimate
children.
the
very
definition
of
an
illegitimate
child
is
a
child
whose
mother
and
father
have
not
been
married.
and
this
court
has
stricken
down
in
several
occasions
the
statutory
provisions
which
discriminate
against
illegitimate
children
eventhough
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
the
discrimination
was
against
woman
workers
because
on
their
depth,
their
children
loss
the
opportunity
for
the
care
of
parent.
mr.
herbert
semmel
i
believe
that
the
holding
of
the
court
is
that
the
victim
under
discrimination
was
a
child
because
the
child
lost
the
opportunity
for
the
care
of
the
parent.
mr.
herbert
semmel
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
but
the
discrimination
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
that
--
that
is
correct,
but
the
sex
discrimination
was
against
the
woman
worker,
not
against
the
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
that's
correct,
but
was
the
working
--
i
mean
it's
the
working
parent
that
was
being
discriminated
against
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
no
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
that
would
be
the
case
if
you
accepted
the
government's
notion
of
what
the
statute
is
all
about,
the
mother's
benefits.
here,
the
--
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute,
we
submit
that
it's
clear,
and
that's
what
wiesenfeld
said
that
we
have
a
discrimination
against
children
because
the
mother's
benefits
were
intended
to
provide
the
child
with
the
opportunity
for
the
care
of
the
mother
in
the
home,
and
that
the
child
is
beneficiary,
just
as
the
child
was
a
beneficiary
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
even
in
statutory
sense
because
in
order
for
this
benefit
to
be
payable,
the
mother
must
have
the
child
in
her
care.
the
child
must
be
receiving
children's
benefits.
it's
only
when
care
of
child
is
involved
that
mother's
benefits
are
payable.
the
--
as
this
court
noted
in
wiesenfeld
and
as
the
statute
makes
clear,
congress
did
not
intend
to
provide
benefits
for
widows
under
age
60.
they
were
expected
to
go
out
into
the
labor
market
during
their
normal
working
life
and
earn
their
living.
it's
only
when
the
widow
has
a
child
in
her
care
that
the
funds
are
made
available.
mr.
herbert
semmel
there
is
no
--
certainly
no
remedy
under
federal
law
in
that
case
that
might
be
problems
with
the
state
law.
but
that
is
also
true
mr.
justice
stevens
with
children's
benefits.
that
is
children's
benefits
are
also
paid
in
most
cases
to
the
mother.
she
could
spend
that
money
however
she
pleases.
but
it's
clear
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
i
--
i
don't
believe
there's
any
specific
legal
requirement
that
she
do
that.
it
--
it
is
conceivable
that
again
under
state
law
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
well
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
i
can't
say
that
the
child
would
have
no
claim.
i
think
in
fact,
the
child
might
have
the
same
claim.
for
example
against
the
mother,
if
she
took
mother's
benefits
and
then
didn't
stay
home
and
take
care
of
the
child.
mr.
herbert
semmel
the
child
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
poverty
is
not
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
well,
if
the
child
actually
has
income
from
earnings
which
exceed
the
earnings
maximum,
the
benefits
for
the
child
would
be
reduced
to.
similarly,
if
the
mother
goes
out
and
works,
eventhough
she's
eligible
for
mother's
benefits,
she
might
not
be
paid
any
because
of
the
earnings
test
and
the
social
security
act
might
reduce
all
of
her
benefits
to
zero.
mr.
herbert
semmel
it
were
--
i
would
think
that
that
it
would
be
the
same
because
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white,
i
agree
with
that.
so
long
as
the
one
of
the
major
purposes
is
benefit
for
the
child
if
it's
deprived
of
illegitimate
children,
then
deprived
of
that
benefit,
then
i
think
i
believe
are
constitutional
claim
is
sustained.
the
--
once
we
have
a
classification
--
i
mean,
i
just
to
go
back
one
moment
and
just
comment
again
on
the
marriage
requirement
as
the
classification
of
illegitimacy.
the
social
security
act
for
example
never
speaks
directly
in
terms
of
illegitimacy
versus
the
legitimacy,
but
this
court
has
stricken
provisions
of
the
statute
on
that
ground.
the
social
security
act
always
talks
in
what
we
might
call
a
neutral
term
which
is
children
who
inherit
an
intestacy
under
state
law,
and
that
effectively
at
least
until
the
trimble
decision
barred
illegitimate
children.
similarly
in
the
new
jersey
welfare
rights
organization
case,
we
have
a
statute
which
provided
welfare
benefits
to
families
consisting
of
husband,
wife
and
children.
and
this
court
struck
that
as
the
discrimination
against
illegitimate
children's
well,
so
that
there's
no
magic
in
the
term
illegitimacy
being
written
into
the
statute.
this
court
has
always
taken
a
look
at
the
--
how
the
statute
operated
in
practice.
the
classification
of
illegitimacy
then
requires
in
the
constitutional
test
a
little
closer
look,
a
little
closer
scrutiny
then
it
sometimes
given
to
other
social
welfare
benefit
cases.
i
think
the
court
--
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
everyone
of
its
decisions
in
point.
and
the
point
that
mr.
justice
stevens
raised
earlier
concerning
a
situation
in
which
congress
may
find
that
only
2%
of
all
mothers
of
illegitimate
children
were
supported
by
the
father.
of
course,
congress
has
not
made
that
finding.
there
is
no
nothing
in
the
record,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
indicates
congress
ever
considered
that,
nor
could
it
have
considered
that
because
when
mother's
benefits
were
adopted,
illegitimate
children
were
ineligible
for
children's
benefits,
and
therefore
ipso
facto
that
they
were
also
not
receiving
mother's
benefits.
and
therefore,
congress
could
not
have
ever
taken
up
this
question
at
any
point
in
enacting
mother's
benefits.
but
we
would
submit
that
even
if
congress
had
taken
that
kind
of
consideration,
that
a
total
exclusion
of
all
illegitimate
children
is
not
justified
by
the
administrative
convenience,
that
is
--
and
that
was
essential
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
jimenez
case
where
it
was
argued
that
after
born
illegitimate
children
could
be
excluded
by
because
relatively
few
children
were
involved
and
that
there
was
an
element
of
administrative
convenience
in
proof
of
paternity
or
support.
and
i
believe
what
the
cases
require
is
a
closer
look
at
how
the
purpose
can
be
achieved.
if
the
purpose
is
to
exclude
families
where
the
father
was
not
supporting
the
families
and
that
can
be
achieved
by
giving
the
family
the
opportunity
to
prove
that
they
were
receiving
the
support.
if
only
2%
of
the
families
provide
that
proof,
then
only
2%
of
the
families
will
get
the
benefit.
but
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
well
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
that's
correct,
but
the
difference
between
third
cousins
and
grandmothers
and
so
on
and
illegitimate
children
is
of
constitutional
significance.
and
this
court
has
had
temptations
in
which
it
has
held
various
forms
of
discrimination
against
illegitimate
children
to
be
unconstitutional.
that's
just
not
the
case
with
third
cousins
or
grandmothers.
and
when
you
get
to
that
classification,
then
the
appropriate
test
is
to
look
carefully
at
the
purpose
to
be
achieved.
and
to
meet
that
test
without
a
total
bar
of
benefits
for
the
class
of
illegitimate
children,
and
that
is
the
failure
of
this
statute
because
it
bars
all
benefits
to
illegitimate
children,
it
bars
those
benefits
whether
or
not
the
father
had
ever
supported
the
children,
whether
the
father
had
ever
supported
the
mother.
and
because
of
that
reason
alone,
the
statute
falls
as
unconstitutional.
the
--
in
the
remaining
moments,
i
would
like
to
comment
just
for
a
moment
on
the
class
action
aspect
of
the
case.
i
did
not
intend
to
argue
on
the
retroactivity
which
i
believe
is
well
covered
in
the
briefs.
with
respect
to
the
class
action,
i
merely
want
to
emphasize
the
limited
nature
of
the
class
relief
and
the
importance
of
the
class
relief.
essentially,
the
class
relief
here
merely
requires
the
social
security
administration
to
notify
all
families
in
which
illegitimate
children
are
receiving
children's
benefits
of
the
decision
of
the
court,
and
so
that
they
will
know
that
now
they
may
come
in
and
apply.
they
will
still
have
to
meet
all
the
other
statutory
requirements
for
mother's
benefits.
they
will
still
have
to
--
mr.
herbert
semmel
we
would
submit
that
we
can
obtain
it
either
on
1331
if
the
205
(h)
is
not
a
bar
to
that.
mr.
herbert
semmel
in
salfi,
the
court
--
it's
not
involved
a
decision
which
ordered
the
payment
of
benefits
to
all
members
of
the
class.
mr.
herbert
semmel
that's
correct.
but
i
submit
that
the
difference
is
that
205
(h)
is
the
counterpart
to
205
(g)
which
provides
for
judicial
review
of
claims
for
benefits.
and
what
205
precludes
is
a
claim
that
is
reviewable
under
205
(g).
there
is
no
way
that
a
--
either
the
appellees
here
or
any
other
potential
recipient
could
file
a
quote
“claim”
with
the
social
security
administration
asking
the
administration
to
notify
all
the
class
members.
and
that's
why
we
need
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
under
1331.
mr.
herbert
semmel
that's
correct,
but
here,
congress
has
provided
in
1331
for
federal
court
jurisdiction
in
constitutional
claims.
that
is
only
reduced
by
section
205
(h)
to
the
extent
that
something
is
acclaimed
under
205
(g).
we
would
submit
that
this
notice
of
requirement
is
not
a
claim
for
benefits
under
205
(g),
and
therefore
not
precluded
by
205
(h).
the
other
side
of
that
would
be
that
if
it
is
a
claim
under
205
(g),
then
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
under
205
(g),
and
that
a
class
relief
is
permissible
under
205
(g).
i
know
that
has
been
submitted
and
argued
in
the
elliott
case
which
is,
is
a
weighing
decision.
mr.
herbert
semmel
that
--
that
is
correct.
thank
you.
