but
even
if
the
court
is
right
on
the
merits
that
this
is
a
non-constitutional
legislative
scheme,
could
not
be
argued
following
up
my
brother
stevens
that
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
court's
functions,
not
to
rewrite
the
statute
to
give
benefits
to
other
people,
but
simply
to
say
this
is
what
congress
has
enacted
as
constitutionally
invalid.

there

you're
right
on
the
merits.
justice

stewart
when
was
the
divorced
former
wife
and
children
put
into
the
statute?
that
was
added?
justice
