justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
we
--
what
if
statute
was
--
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
benefit
to
the
children?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
a
discrimination
against
the
illegitimate?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
agreeing
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
agreeing
with
you.
what
if
we
would
disagree?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
on
the
prospected
payments?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
the
difference
between
the
class
is
this
depends
on
marriage,
not
only
legitimacy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
will
you
bring
up
some
examples
here.
suppose
--
suppose
a
man
lives
with
a
woman
and
has
a
child
but
they
aren't
married.
and
for
some
reason,
they
have
a
divorce
and
agreed
upon
divorce.
at
least,
they
seized
living
together.
and
then
he
marries
another
woman
and
then
he
dies.
and
the
woman
has
been
taking
care
of
his
illegitimate
child
before
he
died.
now,
i
take
it
she's
entitled
to
benefits
and
the
child
is
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
unusual
--
you
call
them
unusual,
no
more
unusual
than
the
one
you
dreamed
of.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
anyway,
the
answer
is
yes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
mother
gets
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
line
isn't
drawn
on
illegitimacy?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
gave
you
some
illegitimate
children
who
were
not
excluded
from
this
benefit.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
any
man
who's
been
living
with
a
woman
and
they're
not
married
and
she
dies
and
they
have
had
children,
it
could
very
usually
end
up
in
the
situation
i
just
mentioned.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least,
you
would
have
to
make
some
effort
to
show
that
congress
was
quite
irrational
and
then
ever
having
thought
what
the
government
suggests
a
thought
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
can
suggest
--
if
you
can
--
if
you're
right
on
that,
the
government
concedes
you
win,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
--
if
you
can
spell
out
of
legislative
history,
a
purpose
to
discriminate
against
illegitimate
children.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
--
but
i
take
your
total
argument.
if
you
can't
spell
that
out,
you
say
the
effect,
the
impact
on
the
illegitimate
children
is
sufficient
to
invalidate
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
light
will
go
on,
don't
worry.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
will
run.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
case
wouldn't
be
really
--
wouldn't
be
any
different
would
it
if
you
just
said
this
was
intended
to
benefit
both
the
mother
and
the
child?
wouldn't
your
case
be
the
same?
the
government's
might
not,
but
wouldn't
yours
be
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
to
why
get
into
big
argument
about
whether
it
was
intended
to
benefit
the
mother
at
all.
it
seems
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
it
did
benefit
the
mother
quite
a
bit.
but
it
also
seems
unlike
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
it
benefitted
--
aim
to
benefit
--
that
it
did
benefit,
that
they
do
benefit
and
was
aimed
to
benefit
the
child
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mrs.
shapiro,
suppose
the
statute
said
that
mothers
of
illegitimate
children
do
not
get
these
benefits
but
mothers
of
legitimate
children
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
your
position
be
the
same?
it
didn't
sound
to
me
like
it
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
exactly.
and
i
thought
that's
all
you
answered
(voice
overlap)--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
that
kind
of
thing,
you
wouldn't
agree
it
was
illegal
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
as
part
of
your
--
part
of
the
submission
of
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
is
that
that's
what
the
exactly
what
the
statute
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
disagree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
might
be
almost
as
good
as
married
if
you're
non-married,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
certainly
you
know
that
--
there's
no
--
not
a
very
perfect
fit
in
any
of
these
classification?
