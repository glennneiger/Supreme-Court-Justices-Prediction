justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
true
in
the
case
of
adding
a
divorced
wife
to
the
widow
when
the
classes
increase,
is
that
same
applied?
i
get
the
impression
from
your
opponent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
this
benefit
scheme,
if
you
have
a
widow
with
the
child
and
a
divorced
wife
with
a
child
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
you
divide
the
maximum
four
ways
instead
of
it
less
worth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
court
will
disagree
with
you
and
agree
with
the
lower
court
on
the
basic
issue
of
whether
the
larger
class
should
be
further
enlarged
to
include
unmarried
--
persons
who
never
married
the
wage
earner
who
have
children
by
the
wage
earner,
you
then
have
a
kind
of
a
tricky
job
of
rewriting
the
statute
it
seems
to
me
because
not
starts
out
the
widow
on
the
every
surviving
divorced
mother.
but
i
don't
understand
you
to
have
questioned
the
remedy
in
the
sense
that
the
court
had
the
power
not
merely
to
hold
the
classification
unconstitutional.
say,
no
benefit
shall
be
paid
pursuant
to
the
statute
because
it's
discriminatory.
rather
what
the
court
held
was
we're
going
on
large
the
class
beyond
the
class
described
by
congress
and
pay
benefits
to
people
congress
didn't
authorize
payment.
you
don't
question
the
district
court's
power
to
grant
that
kind
of
relief
as
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
another
cases
that
construed
mother,
to
mean
mother
and
father
or
i
don't
know
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
here,
i
don't
know
what
should
do.
i
don't
know
what
word
has
a
different
meaning
to
all
of
these.
you
got
to
just
inject
a
new
word
into
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
question
the
power
of
the
court
to
have
done
that?
i
just
want
to
be
clear
about
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
and
that
they
said
they
run
on
the
merits
and
that
sovereign
immunity
point
to
the
others
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
but
i
just
want
to
focus
on
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
you
correctly,
you're
saying
that
this
statute
what
you
consider
a
constitutional
defect
in
the
statute
would
be
cured
if
the
mother,
the
unmarried
mother
were
given
the
opportunity
to
prove
that
at
the
time
of
the
wage
earners
death,
she
was
receiving
the
support
of
the
wage
earner.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
if
you
concede
that
and
if
there
were
empirical
evidence
that
congress
considered
and
i
don't
know
whether
there
is
or
not
that
that's
true
and
only
2%
of
the
cases
of
unmarried
mothers,
most
unmarried
mothers
who've
not
been
living
with
the
wage
earner
for
a
matter
of
years
prior
to
his
death
are
not
then
receiving
a
support,
then
i
would
think
you
have
to
admit
that
this
classification
was
irrational
classification.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
touchstone
isn't
--
the
touchtone
is
marriage.
the
outer
limit
of
the
class
is
was
the
person
ever
married
to
the
wage
earner.
and
if
you
concede
that
that
this
would
be
saved
by
the
--
by
making
special
provision
for
those
mothers
of
illegitimate
children
who
could
prove
actual
dependency,
then
it
seems
to
me
you're
argument
must
really
rely
on
an
assumption
that
a
very
significant
portion
of
the
members
of
your
class
were
in
fact
receiving
support
from
the
wage
earner
at
the
time
of
death.
and
you
didn't
even
allege
that
as
to
your
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
remember
the
pleadings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
again
the
discrimination
there
was
concededly
against
husbands
as
opposed
to
wives.
it
wasn't
any
claim
of
discrimination
against
any
set
of
children,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
victim
of
the
discrimination
was
the
parent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
it
was
the
sex
discrimination
case
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
only
sex
--
the
difference
in
sex
was
at
the
parent
level.
it
didn't
matter
whether
the
children
were
male
or
female.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
was
an
irrational
sex
discrimination
because
they
purported
to
justify
it
on
the
basis
and
the
different
status
or
the
different
children.
but
still,
the
person
being
discriminated
against
was
one
parent
or
the
other
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright.
in
here,
it's
the
mother.
isn't
it
correct
to
say
here
the
person
is
being
discriminated
against
is
the
mother
of
the
illegitimate
child?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
who
is
not
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
happen
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
go
ahead,
mr.
justice.
i'm
just
going
to
say,
the
child
is
the
beneficiary
indirectly,
but
not
in
the
statutory
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
it
be
if
the
mother
took
the
money
and
spend
it
on
clothes
or
alcohol
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
she's
a
trustee
for
the
child
of
those
benefits.
she
must
use
the
money
for
the
benefit
of
the
child,
doesn't
she?
i
maybe
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
child
would
have
no
claim
if
she
took
all
that
money
and
spend
it
on
clothes
for
herself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
there's
a
legal
difference
between
the
two.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
child
is
independently
wealthy,
maybe
inherited
a
lot
of
money
from
somebody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
still
that
you
know,
that
the
financial,
the
poverty
isn't
the
test
of
whether
they
get
benefits
if
i
remember
it
correctly,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
have
and
independently
wealthy
child,
it
might
be
15
years
old,
maybe
a
very
successful
newspaper
author
or
something,
and
he
doesn't
need
the
money.
but
in
the
child's
benefit,
he's
entitled
to
it
but
he's
not
entitled
to
mother's
benefit.
isn't
that
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
the
government
to
be
arguing
that
it
doesn't
matter
if
administrative
convenience
but
rather
that
this
is
a
large
class
of
persons.
most
of
them
probably
were
not
receiving
support
from
the
wage
earner
at
the
time
of
the
wage
earners
death,
and
therefore
they
don't
come
within
the
notion
of
substituting
benefits
for
prior
support.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
--
i
don'
think
it's
a
matter
of
administrative
convenience
because
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
might
be
able
to
prove
they
were
getting
support,
a
grandmother
or
a
third
cousin
or
a
good
friend
or
something,
but
wouldn't
be
eligible
for
social
security
simply
for
that
reason
because
the
social
security
system
operates
on
a
bunch
of
rules
that
large
classes
are
defined
in
terms
of
probabilities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
that,
what
about
the
mother's
benefit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
shapiro,
i
am
somewhat
puzzled
by
your
concession
that
intent
makes
any
difference.
it
seems
to
me,
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing
in
all
these
cases.
and
if
the
test
were
phrased
in
terms
of
mothers
of
illegitimate
children,
the
mother
no
longer
living
with
the
wage
earner,
but
not
having
lived
with
the
wage
earner
at
the
time
of
his
death.
it
seemed
to
me
there
would
be
the
same
probability
and
it
just
may
be
what
mr.
justice
white
was
implying,
the
same
probability
that
the
wage
earner
was
not
supporting
that
particular
mother
because
you
really
have
the
same
set
up
whether
you
describe
her
as
a
mother
of
an
illegitimate
child
or
as
a
person
who's
not
a
wife.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
always
an
intent
to
discriminate
if
you
say
that
class
a
gets
benefits
and
class
b
doesn't
get
benefits.
you're
always
discriminating
intentionally
against
class
b.
the
people
in
class
b,
no
matter
how
you
phrase
the
statute
are
still
a
large
group
of
mothers
who
are
not
living
with
the
wage
earner
who
happened
to
have
children
by
him
at
some
earlier
point
in
time.
and
the
constitutionality
depends
on
how
they
phrase
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
both
cases,
i
assume
they
were.
