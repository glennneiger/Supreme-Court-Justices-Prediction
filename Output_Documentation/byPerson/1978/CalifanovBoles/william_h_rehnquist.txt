rehnquist
then,
you're
using
your
definition
of
a
class
in
effect
to
explain
how
the
statute
operates.
and
actually,
your
definition
of
a
class
is
narrower
than
the
operation
of
the
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
have
been
relevant
in
the
district
court,
would
it
not?
you
say
this
isn't
just
simply
a
denial
of
a
benefit
you're
appealing
from
or
you
might
well
be
precluded
by
one
of
the
preclusion
section.
if
you're
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
a
provision,
i
would
think
that
sort
of
evidence
that
you
and
justice
stevens
had
your
colloquy
about
would
have
been
admissible.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
based
on
1331
isn't
it?
that's
the
only
were
you
can
get
that
kind
of
relief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think,
didn't
we
hold
in
salfi
that
it
was
a
bar?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
we
said
you
couldn't
bring
that
under
1331
by
reason
the
preclusionary
provisions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
lots
of
people
need
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts,
but
they
don't
get
it
because
congress
hasn't
given
it
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
two
arguments
are
mutually
inconsistent
to
that.
you
can
go
either
one
or
the
other,
but
not
both.
