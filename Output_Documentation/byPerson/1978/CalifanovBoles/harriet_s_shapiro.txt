ms.
harriet

mr.
chief
justice
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i'm
sorry.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
by
the
government
from
a
decision
of
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
texas.
this
is
another
case
questioning
the
constitutionality
of
the
social
security
act.
the
particular
provision
involved
here
is
the
marriage
requirement
for
mother's
benefits.
the
wage
earner,
norman
w.
boles
lived
with
margaret
gonzales
who
is
the
claimant
from
1963
to
1966,
but
they
were
never
married.
their
son
norman
j.
boles
was
born
in
1964.
in
1966,
the
wage
earner
left
margaret
gonzales
and
his
child
and
he
married
nancy
boles
in
1967.
there
were
two
children
born
in
this
marriage
and
the
wage
earner
died
in
1971.
all
three
children
are
receiving
children's
benefits
on
norman
w.
boles'
account.
mother's
benefits
are
paid
to
the
widow
of
a
wage
earner
who
has
an
entitled
child
in
her
care.
for
that
reason,
nancy
boles
is
getting
mother's
benefits
and
margaret
gonzales
was
denied
mother's
benefits
because
she
was
never
married
to
the
wage
earner,
eventhough
her
son
is
receiving
benefits
and
is
in
her
care.
the
district
court
read
this
court's
decision
in
weinberger
versus
wiesenfeld
as
holding
that
mother's
benefits
are
for
the
child
to
give
him
the
care
of
his
surviving
parent.
the
court
found
that
norman
j.
boles,
the
child,
had
himself
been
denied
mother's
benefits
because
of
his
illegitimacy.
and
that
that
denial
was
inconsistent
with
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
it
therefore
declared
section
202
(g)
of
the
social
security
act,
the
mother's
benefit
provision
unconstitutional
to
the
extent
that
it
limited
benefits
to
widows
and
divorced
wives.
the
court
enjoined
the
secretary
from
denying
mother's
benefits
to
the
named
plaintiffs
or
to
the
class
which
consists
of
all
illegitimate
children
and
their
mothers
who
are
ineligible
for
mother's
benefits
solely
because
they
were
never
married
to
the
wage
earner.
all
the
children
in
the
class
like
norman
boles
are
getting
children's
benefits.
their
only
claim
is
that
they
have
been
injured
by
the
failure
to
pay
mother's
benefits
to
their
mothers
with
whom
they
are
living.
the
true
requirements
for
mother's
benefits,
they
are
particularly
are
important
here
are
first,
that
they
are
paid
to
the
widow
or
to
persons
that
congress
has
decided
should
be
treated
as
if
they
were
widows.
that
of
course
is
the
marriage
requirement.
second,
the
widow
must
have
in
her
care
a
child
getting
benefits
because
of
his
relationship
to
the
wage
earner,
that
usually
of
course
would
be
the
widow's
child,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be.
it's
the
child
relationship
to
the
wage
earner,
not
to
the
person
that
is
caring
for
him
that
counts.
and
the
child's
legitimacy
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
widow's
entitlement.
these
two
requirements
serve
analytically
different
purposes.
the
first,
the
marriage
requirement
defines
the
class
of
those
who
are
likely
to
have
been
dependent
on
the
wage
earner
during
his
life.
and
that
class
includes
all
the
people
that
congress
believed
were
most
likely
to
have
lost
support
when
the
wage
earner
died.
but
lost
of
support
is
not
itself
enough.
the
second,
child
in
care
requirement
defines
the
group
within
the
larger
class
who
because
of
special
circumstances
are
entitled
to
the
replacement
of
lost
support.
if
you
don't
show
membership
within
this
particular
subgroup,
then
congress
felt
that
eventhough
you
may
have
lost
support
when
the
wage
earner
died,
you
should
make
up
that
support
through
your
own
efforts.
analytically,
the
child
in
care
provision
is
very
similar
to
the
age
requirement
for
elderly
widows.
the
theory
behind
mother's
benefits
is
that
a
wife
with
an
entitled
child
in
her
care
should
have
the
same
option
that
she
had
before
her
husband's
death.
that
is,
either
to
stay
home,
supported
by
her
husband
to
take
care
of
the
children,
or
else
to
work
and
help
to
support
the
family.
the
theory
is
that
she
shouldn't
lose
this
choice
when
the
wage
earner
dies,
and
that's
why
she
gets
the
benefits.
the
important
point
is
that
the
class
definition,
the
marriage
requirement
sets
the
outer
limits
of
those
congress
found
likely
to
have
lost
support.
it
is
the
group
definition
is
a
limitation
on
the
class.
it
defines
the
people
within
the
class
who
are
entitled
to
the
replacement
of
lost
support.
ms.
gonzales
never
married
the
wage
earner.
she
can't
meet
any
of
the
other
tests
that
congress
has
used
to
identify
people
who
are
so
likely
to
have
lost
support
at
the
wage
earners
death
that
they
should
be
treated
as
though
they
were
married.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
in
fact
that
these
tests
were
inaccurate
as
to
ms.
gonzales.
there's
no
suggestion
that
she
was
in
fact
supported
by
the
wage
earner
that
she
lost
any
support
when
he
died.
since
she
doesn't
belong
to
the
class
that
congress
has
identified
as
likely
to
have
lost
support,
she's
not
entitled
to
benefits.
this
court's
cases
strongly
support
our
analysis
of
the
statute.
the
court
has
frequently
accepted
the
social
security
acts
use
of
marriage
to
show
the
likelihood
of
support.
and
it
has
rejected
claims
that
marriage
is
to
inaccurate
or
imprecise,
an
indicator
of
the
likelihood
of
support
to
serve
as
a
basis
for
denying
claims.
and
it
has
also
refused
to
require
that
people
who
cannot
meet
some
particular
part
of
the
marriage
requirement
should
be
entitled
to
prove
that
they
were
in
fact
dependent.
and
there's
no
reason
to
reach
a
different
result
here.
the
court
below
believed
wiesenfeld
required
the
different
result.
it
said
that
this
court
held
there
that
mother's
benefits
are
for
the
child
so
that
he
can
receive
the
care
of
the
surviving
parent.
but
that
misreads
wiesenfeld.
the
court
there
was
focusing
on
the
class
definition
for
mother's
benefits,
the
definition
of
the
individuals
likely
to
have
lost
support
when
the
wage
earner
died.
it
found
that
husbands
as
a
class
are
as
likely
who
have
lost
support
when
the
wage
earner
dies
as
are
wives.
wiesenfeld
therefore
supports
our
analysis
of
the
statute
because
it
recognizes
that
being
entitled
to
mother's
benefits
depends
on
membership
in
the
class
likely
to
have
lost
support
when
the
wage
earner
died.
that's
the
reason
that
wiesenfeld
was
controlling
goldfarb.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
if
you
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
if
--
as
long
as
this
is
a
--
as
long
as
you
recognize
that
this
is
a
benefit
that
is
paid
to
the
mother
in
recognition
of
a
likelihood
of
support,
then
the
answer
is
clear
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
if
--
if
you
feel
that
the
case
involves
an
intent
to
discriminate
against
illegitimate
children,
then
we
lose.
i'm
not
sure
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
class
action
in
the
retroactive
payments,
yes.
i'm
not
sure
that
even
in
that
case,
the
defendant
--
the
appellees
should
win
because
i'm
not
sure
that
if
you
say
that
this
--
that
you
have
to
look
at
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
child,
the
statute
doesn't
really
make
any
sense.
it's
--
you
can't
look
at
this
as
a
statute
that
says
mothers
of
illegitimate
children
don't
get
benefits
and
mothers
of
legitimate
children
do.
the
statute
simply
doesn't
operate
that
way.
the
cases
we've
cited
in
our
reply
brief
show
that
it's
the
relationship
to
the
wage
earner
plus
having
in
you're
here
an
entitled
child.
and
if
you
say
that
any
illegitimate
--
the
mother
of
any
illegitimate
child
gets
benefits.
that
means
that
illegitimate
children
get
an
advantage
that
legitimate
children
don't.
and
you
turn
a
statute
--
you
require
the
statute
to
favor
illegitimates.
it
--
it
seriously
distorts
wiesenfeld
to
read
it
as
meaning
that
the
mother's
benefit
is
really
a
child's
benefit.
the
wiesenfeld
child
was
not
a
party
to
the
case.
the
court
didn't
consider
his
lost
of
support
or
need
for
the
replacement
of
lost
support.
he
was
already
getting
benefits
based
on
those
needs.
it
was
the
surviving
husband
that
was
claiming
the
benefits.
it
was
his
lost
of
support
and
his
relationship
to
the
wage
earner
that
made
him
entitled
to
benefits.
neither
is
it
fair
to
read
wiesenfeld
as
meaning
that
social
security
act
benefits
are
somehow
designed
to
recognize
the
emotional
trauma
suffered
by
a
child
who
loses
a
parent,
and
for
that
reason,
entitled
him
to
the
care
of
his
surviving
parent
who
could
not
have
stayed
home
to
care
for
him
before
the
death.
appellees
here
are
not
arguing
that
this
court's
decision
approving
the
use
of
the
marriage
requirement
is
wrong.
they
don't
even
argue
that
the
decisions
of
applying
the
marriage
requirement
in
the
particular
context
of
mother's
benefits
are
wrong.
they
are
not
saying
that
salfi
was
wrongly
decided
or
that
de
castro
was.
they
argue
only
that
the
requirement
cannot
be
used
to
deprive
illegitimate
children
of
mother's
benefits
because
it
is
a
classification
based
on
illegitimacy.
but
it's
not
a
classification
based
on
the
child's
legitimacy.
it's
a
classification
based
on
the
caretaker's
likelihood
of
lost
support
that
has
a
disparate
effect
on
illegitimates.
that's
not
enough
to
show
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
appellees
must
show
an
addition
at
least
that
their
explanation
of
the
statute's
purpose
explains
its
operation
better
than
ours
does.
the
examples
given
on
our
reply
brief
show
that
the
way
the
statute
operates
can
only
be
reasonably
explained
in
terms
of
the
replacement
of
lost
support.
it's
not
a
grant
of
benefits
to
mothers
of
legitimate
children
and
a
denial
to
mothers
of
illegitimate
ones.
our
example
show
that
congress
here
as
it
did
throughout
the
social
security
act
chose
to
pay
benefits
only
to
the
people
who
could
show
both
that
they
are
in
a
class
likely
to
have
lost
support
and
that
they
have
a
special
need
for
the
replacement
of
that
support.
the
legitimacy
of
the
child
being
cared
for
is
totally
irrelevant.
there's
another
example
of
this.
when
a
woman
dies
living
young
children,
the
surviving
wage
earner's
mother
or
other
relative
often
moves
into
the
household
to
care
for
the
children
and
she's
then
supported
by
the
wage
earner.
if
the
wage
earner
then
dies,
the
grandmother
gets
no
benefits.
she
has
the
same
problem
that
ms.
gonzales
has
here.
she
can't
show
that
she's
the
member
of
any
class
congress
concluded
was
likely
to
have
lost
support
when
the
wage
earner
died.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
children
are
legitimate
or
not
in
this
example.
appellees
argument
boils
down
to
a
claim
that
a
statutory
scheme
that
is
neutral
as
regards
to
legitimacy
must
be
turned
into
one
that
favors
the
mothers
of
illegitimate
children.
this
favoritism
is
then
demanded
in
the
name
of
equal
protection.
this
case
presents
an
extreme
example
of
the
risks
of
seemingly
minor
changes
in
the
benefit
system
established
by
congress.
first,
it
distorts
the
statutory
purpose
of
providing
benefits
only
to
those
most
likely
to
have
been
supported
by
the
wage
earner.
second,
the
extension
of
benefits
to
an
additional
group
means
that
the
real
purpose
of
the
benefits
may
be
lost.
neither
the
new
group
nor
the
group
that
congress
defined
may
actually
get
enough
support
to
stay
home
to
care
for
children.
this
is
because
the
statute
limits
the
total
amount
payable
on
any
given
wage
earner's
amount
--
account
in
anyone
must.
the
maximum
will
always
be
reached
when
three
survivors
are
being
paid.
so,
when
you
have
a
widow
and
a
child
being
paid
benefits
in
one
household
and
an
entitled
child
in
another
household,
you
will
have
reached
the
statutory
maximum.
if
you
add
the
mother
of
the
entitled
child,
then,
the
benefits
that
were
previously
payable
will
have
to
be
reallocated
from
the
benefits
that
were
going
to
three
people,
the
same
benefits
have
to
go
to
four
people.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it's
the
same
principle
applies.
the
only
people
that
are
outside
of
the
family
maximum
are
the
aged
divorced
wives.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
but
--
and
congress
concluded
that
in
that
situation,
they
were
willing
to
make
that
that
division.
but
adding
to
it
will
undercut
the
purpose
of
the
statute
because
it
well,
increase
the
number
of
situations
in
which
you
will
have
spread
your
benefits
so
thinly
that
they
won't
provide
support
so
that
nobody
can't
stay
home.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
we
don't.
that's
the
kind
of
relief
that
this
court
has
granted
in
the
past
in
cases
in
which
it
found
that
particular
limitations.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
true.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
what
the
district
court
said
was
you
can't
apply
the
statutory
requirements
only
in
the
case
of
illegitimate
children
living
with
--
and
their
mothers
who
were
denied
benefits
that
get
just
kind
of
by
main
force
in
awkwardness
pulled
out
that
group
and
said
that
group
gets
benefits.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
we
don't.
well,
we
don't
question
their
power.
we
certainly
questioned
the
advisability
of
it
and
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
--
that's
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
cert
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it
would
be
an
option.
i
think
that
it
would
be
very
hard
on
the
mother's
who
are
now
getting
benefits
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it's
--
it's
not
the
way
this
court
has
felt
their
function
was
--
that
that
was
the
end
of
their
function
in
cases
like
wiesenfeld
or
goldfarb
which
--
in
which
they
found
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
expand
at
the
benefits.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right,
that's
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
that's
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
withdraw
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
first,
just
as
a
matter
of
clarification
of
the
child's
benefit
must
be
used
for
the
child.
there
representative
pay
--
received
the
payment
on
behalf
of
the
child
and
suppose
to
use
it
for
the
child.
the
main
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
mother's
benefit
is
for
her
own
use,
and
she
can
use
it
as
she
wishes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
may
have
misunderstood
mr.
justice
white's
question
to
me
earlier.
i
gather
that
what
you
were
asking
was
that
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
our
position
and
consider
the
benefit
to
be
a
child's
benefit,
what
then?
and
the
answer
would
be
that
there's
really
in
that
case
to,
it's
not
a
discrimination
against
illegitimates.
if
you
look
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
child,
what
the
statute
is
doing
is
saying
that
in
the
situation
where
the
mother
was
not
married
to
the
wage
earner.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
then
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
then,
if
then
--
then
you're
saying
it
would
be
intentional
discrimination
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
that's
what
i
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
if
it's
an
intentional
discrimination
against
illegitimate
children.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
well,
--
but
the
problem
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
the
--
the
question
there
i
guess
would
be
that
if
you
take
that
position,
then,
is
illegitimacy
a
sufficient
act
--
sufficiently
accurate
indicator
of
the
likelihood
of
lost
support,
so
that
you
can
ignore
the
possibility
that
there
might
have
been
situations
in
which
the
child's
mother,
the
wage
earner
was
supporting
the
unmarried
mother
of
his
children.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
no.
the
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
true.
but
i
guess
the
point
is
that
if
--
comparing
this
case
with
lucas,
in
lucas,
it
was
very
--
it
was
significant
that
there
was
an
opportunity
to
prove
actual
dependency.
but
that
may
well
be
because
the
chances
of
a
wage
earner
supporting
his
illegitimate
children
is
greater
than
the
chance
that
he
was
supporting
his
--
the
mother
of
his
illegitimate
children,
so
that
you
have
a
different
kind
of
a
relationship
between
the
policy
and
the
statute
here
than
you
would
there.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
problem
is
if
it's
the
intent
to
discriminate
or
whether
it
simply
a
disparate
effect
of
the
use
of
a
perfectly
proper
method
of
distinguishing
between
people
who
are
likely
to
have
been
supported
and
people
who
weren't.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
the
constitutionality
depends
on
what
whether
--
what
congress
is
doing
is
trying
to
distinguish
between
people
who
were
likely
to
get
support
and
were
not.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
okay.
if
that's
what
they
were
doing,
then
the
fact
that
this
perfectly
proper,
reasonable
statutory
distinction
has
a
disparate
effect
on
illegitimate
children
is
not
enough
to
constitute
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
that
is
the
way
we
read
washington
v.
davis.
thank
you.
