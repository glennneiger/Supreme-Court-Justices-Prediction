mr.
knox
bemis
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
stevens
you
were
asking
of
practical
consequences.
the
only
one
that
i
can
cite
for
you
is
the
producer
has
to
continue
to
file
reports
on
the
particular
acreage.
that
in
fact
is
apparently
how
the
commission
knew
to
send
the
letters
to
the
producer
involved
here
asking
to
file
for
abandonment.
i
intend
to
speak
primarily
of
the
reasons
why
pipe
line
and
it’s
customers
need
the
safeguards
of
the
section
7(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
and
why
these
safeguards
would
be
undercut
by
the
holding
of
the
tenth
circuit
on
the
position
of
the
mccombs
group
here.
i
also
intend
to
speak
of
practical
problems
and
uncertainties
that
would
arise
either
from
the
holding
of
the
court
below
or
the
position
of
the
mccombs
group.
one
of
the
statutory
purposes
or
section
7(b)
as
indicated
in
the
due
hearing
language
in
that
section,
is
that
interested
parties
be
afforded
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
when
a
producer
or
any
other
natural
gas
company
files
for
abandonment.
indeed
it
is
the
commission’s
policy
and
practice
to
issues
notices
of
the
filing
of
such
applications;
such
notices
giving
any
interested
party
the
chance
to
come
in
and
state
any
objections.
that
opportunity
is
afforded
whether
or
not
a
formal
hearing
is
actually
held.
now
of
course
in
this
case
there
was
no
such
hearing.
there
was
no
such
notice.
indeed
there
was
no
informal
notice
even.
the
producer
never
asked
united
either
to
agree
to
abandonment
of
the
certificate
or
to
release
the
producer
from
his
contract
obligations.
now,
yet
as
asserted
by
the
mccombs
group
and
apparently
assumed
by
the
court
below,
that
abandonment
would
have
been
routinely
granted
if
it
had
been
sought.
that
however
is
by
no
means
clear.
first
of
all,
it
is
by
no
means
clear
in
the
circumstance
that
united
having
a
contract
that
it
regarded
as
still
being
in
effect
with
the
producer,
would
have
agreed,
would
have
consented
or
would
have
agreed
not
to
object,
if
you
will.
second,
we
have
few
other
question
of
whether
the
reserves
were
in
fact
depleted
in
1966.
now
a
lot
of
the
routine
abandonment
cases
i
believe
involve
a
situation
where
you
have
no
indication
whatsoever
of
continuing
production.
we
know
that
on
the
butler
b
lease
in
1966
despite
the
cessation
of
the
natural
gas
production
there
was
production
from
an
oil
well.
in
other
words
you
have
continuing
hydrocarbon
productions
all
the
way
through
the
period.
furthermore
the
record
does
not
show
the
extent
if
any
to
quite
show
there
were
deeper
test
in
areas
adjoining
or
close
by
the
butler
b
lease
when
the
producers
asserts
abandonment
that
would
have
been
routine
like
granted.
so
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
knox
bemis
that’s
exactly,
right.
mr.
knox
bemis
yes,
that’s
very
close
to
this
situation.
i
believe,
what
happened
here
was
a
drill
for
deeper
reserves
that
is
of
course
related
to
the
economics
of
the
–
mr.
knox
bemis
that
is
correct
too.
and
indeed
this
is
not
an
uncommon
situation
there.
the
fact
that
production
seized
at
one
time
in
the
past
is
by
no
means
and
itself
indicative
of
there
being
no
future
gas
production
or
the
supplies
being
exhausted
within
the
meaning
of
section
7(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act.
so
we
really
do
not
know
what
would
have
happened
even
though
as
the
mccombs
group
points
out
there
were
a
number
of
routine
abandonment
applications
granted
during
that
period.
that
incidentally
is
not
so
more
recently.
in
fact
there
is
a
recent
decision
of
the
commission
proceeding
involving
a
texaco
where
the
commission
declined
to
grant
abandonment
on
essentially
the
same
facts
as
what
have
appeared
here
in
the
period
1966
through
1971.
the
right
of
the
interstate
pipeline
and
its
customers
have
been
cut-off
by
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
and
would
be
cut-off
by
the
position
adopted
by
the
mccombs
group
here.
in
its
brief
the
mccombs
group
argues
that
the
hearing
in
this
proceeding
is
not
a
good
substitute
for
the
hearing
that
should
have
been
held
on
the
abandonment
application
they
should
have
filed
in
1966.
that
clearly
cannot
be
maintained.
the
hearing
in
this
case
involved
the
question
of
retroactive
abandonment
of
course.
it
also
has
as
its
basis,
as
its
starting
point,
the
knowledge
that
the
central
fact
that
the
producer
would
have
been
trying
to
establish
then
i.e.
depletion
of
reserves
is
false.
in
other
words,
it
is
very
difficult
to
have
a
due
hearing
about
whether
the
reserves
have
been
depleted
when
you
know
that
they
have
not
been
depleted
and
you
are
trying
to
speculate
as
to
what
the
parties
would
have
thought
about
depletion
if
the
hearing
had
been
held
at
some
date
in
the
past.
so
clearly
the
hearing
in
this
proceeding
cannot
substitute
for
what
was
the
party’s
right
under
section
7(b)
at
the
earlier
date.
i
would
like
to
speak
also
to
the
practical
problems
and
uncertainties
so
that
would
stem
from
the
decision
of
the
court
below
or
the
position
of
mccombs
group.
the
abandonment
order
is
a
trust,
a
definitive
reliable
and
public
document,
telling
you
whether
the
acreage
is
still
dedicated.
there
would
be
substitute
for
that,
of
the
decision
that
court
below,
a
determination
by
the
parties
i
suppose
whether
at
some
point
in
the
past
people
would
reasonably
have
thought
the
reserves
to
have
been
depleted.
moreover,
the
court
below
speaks
about
the
length
of
time,
five
years,
between
the
last
production
and
the
new
production.
if
that’s
a
factor
how
long
does
it
have
to
be.
similarly
on
the
position
of
mccombs
group
you
have
to
determine
not
only
those
factors,
but
also
whether
there
is
good
faith
involved.
the
mccombs
group
also
makes
the
point
that
the
abandonment
orders
themselves
may
not
be
recordable
and
argue
that
that’s
the
reason
for
not
requiring
abandonment.
however,
the
problem
there
is
not
whether
you
can
record
the
abandonment
orders.
the
real
problem
and
the
real
goal
is
to
put
the
producers
on
notice
or
to
put
subsequent
lessees
on
notice
that
there
is
a
gas
purchase
contract,
an
obligation
in
that
respect,
that
was
on
record
here.
united
had
filed
in
the
land
records
the
evidence
of
this
contract
and
it
indeed
turn
up
in
one
of
the
title
opinions
that
the
producers
got.
it's
easy
to
find
out
if
you
are
on
notice
to
the
contract
whether
the
property
has
been
certificated
and
whether
an
abandonment
has
been
granted,
you
get
from
pipeline
and
no
where
else.
finally
i
would
like
to
mention
this,
at
one
point
in
mccombs
brief
on
page
19,
there
is
a
quotation
in
the
testimony
of
united
witness
mr.
oban
that
suggests
that
united
thought
and
took
the
position
that
the
certificate
obligation
terminated
when
the
property
ceased
to
produce
1966.
that
is
not
correct
and
that’s
not
the
implication
of
his
testimony.
it's
not
just
the
implication
of
his
testimony,
he
says
something
very
different
in
the
record.
the
record
will
show
that
what
he
was
talking
about
was
united’s
right
as
it
constituted
to
remove
a
metering
station
because
it
was
a
gathering
facility
not
because
any
certificate
obligation
terminated.
united
never
took
any
action
here
that
indicated
that
it
felt
that
either
the
certificate
obligation
or
the
contract
obligation
had
terminated.
thank
you.
