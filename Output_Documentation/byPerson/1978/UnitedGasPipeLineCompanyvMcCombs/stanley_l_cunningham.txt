mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
a
threshold
issue
in
this
case
about
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
the
commission
and
united
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
engaging
in
prohibited
judicial
fact
finding
and
as
bypassing
the
commission’s
functions.
we
on
the
other
hand
make
no
such
reading
of
the
court
of
appeal’s
opinion
and
as
i
present
my
argument
this
morning
i
would
point
out
the
relevant
aspects
of
the
court
of
appeal’s
opinion
which
we
believe
support
our
reading
there.
in
opinion
number
740,
the
commission
took
two
actions
which
formed
the
basis
of
the
issues
before
the
court.
first,
the
commission
failed
to
grant
mccombs'
request
to
retroactively
apply
the
act
as
if
haring
had
applied
for
abandonment
and
had
filed
the
proper
papers
in
1966.
second,
the
court
ordered
mccombs
to
deliver
gas
to
united
on
the
grounds
that
the
word
service
rendered
as
used
in
section
7(b)
are
not
to
be
accorded
their
plain
meaning.
on
judicial
review,
mccombs
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
both
of
these
holdings
constituted
error.
we
believe
that
a
proper
reading
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
indicates
that
the
court
agreed
with
us
on
the
first
issue
and
therefore
found
it
unnecessary
to
discuss
the
second.
the
first
issue
depends
on
the
application
of
equitable
principle
which
has
been
worked
out
between
the
courts
and
the
commission
and
for
nearly
a
period
of
40
years
and
which
involves
--
and
which
does
not
involve
the
interpretation
of
any
federal
statute.
this
principle
and
the
principle
which
was
urged
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
when
a
party
is
in
good
faith
and
failing
to
file
the
proper
papers
with
the
commission
at
the
proper
time
the
commission
should
retroactively
apply
the
act
as
if
the
party
had
complied
with
the
act
at
the
proper
time.
this
principle
is
supported
by
four
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeals
cited
in
our
brief.
i
would
point
out
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
required
the
commission
to
apply
the
principle
uniformly
regardless
of
whether
it
benefited
or
burdened
the
party
failing
to
file.
that’s
in
the
niagara
mohawk
case
cited
in
our
brief,
the
application
of
the
principle
burdened
the
party
for
the
reason
that
it
obtained
a
hydroelectric
license
for
a
shorter
duration
then
it
would
otherwise
had
received.
however,
in
the
highland’s
case,
also
cited
in
our
brief,
the
party
failing
to
file
was
benefited,
because
it
achieved
higher
rates
than
it
would
otherwise
had
been
permitted.
similarly,
in
plaquemines
and
ellwood
cited
in
our
brief,
the
party
failing
to
file
was
benefited
for
the
reason
that
they
were
not
required
to
make
refunds
that
was
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
very
good.[luncheon
break]
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
luncheon
recess,
i
was
discussing
the
equitable
principle
in
this
case
that
where
a
party
as
in
good
faith
in
failing
to
file
the
proper
papers
with
the
commission
at
the
proper
time
that
the
commission
should
retroactively
apply
the
act
as
if
the
party
had
complied
there
with.
i
pointed
out
that
this
principle
has
been
required
by
the
courts
to
be
applied
in
situations
where
both
benefits
and
burdens
the
party
failing
to
file.
the
application
of
the
principle
involves
asking
the
present
commission
to,
in
the
language
of
the
plaquemines
case
reconstruct
the
past
to
reflect
compliance
with
the
act
and
does
not
therefore
involve
the
obtaining
of
affidavits
or
sworn
statements
from
past
commissions
as
to
what
they
might
have
done
with
the
situation.
moreover,
the
principle
applies
the
section
7(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act
as
demonstrated
by
the
commission’s
own
order
in
the
hewitt
and
(inaudible)
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
in
that
case,
the
reserves
were
depleted
before
this
court’s
decision
in
the
phillips
case.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
it
has
a
history
of
about
40
years
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
you
mean
the
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
your
honor,
the
principle
i
think
would
be
applicable
regardless
of
the
time
span
between
the
date
the
filing
should
have
been
made
and
the
date
of
filing
was
actually
made.
in
some
of
these
cases,
the
time
span
runs
from
five
to
ten
years.
i
don’t
recall
a
case
that
has
had
a
time
span,
which
is
longer
than
10
years,
for
example.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
your
honor,
there
was
a
hearing
before
the
commission
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
they
refused
to
apply
the
act
retroactively
not
on
the
grounds
that
if
they
had
applied
the
act
retroactively
that
they
would
have
found
in
1966
that
the
reserves
were
totally
exhausted.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
no
your
honor,
because
the
evidence
in
1966
was
that
of
haring,
who
was
a
petroleum
geologist
who
testified
that
at
the
time
his
reserves
were
depleted
in
1966
that
neither
he
nor
united
or
anyone
else
knew
of
any
further
reserves.
now,
in
the
light
of
that
testimony,
the
commission
could
only
had
made
one
finding,
concerning
the
situation
as
it
existed
in
1966
and
that
finding
was
as
required
by
the
statute
that
the
available
supply
of
natural
gas
was
depleted.
now
that
file
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
un-controverted,
your
honor.
if
the
commission
had
found
the
other
way
concerning
the
facts
in
1966
that
would
have
been
reversible
as
being
contrary
to
the
evidence.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
there
would
have
been
no
substantial
which
would
have
supported
the
finding
that
the
reserves
were
not
depleted
in
1966.
in
the
hewitt
and
dougherty
case
which
shows
that
this
principle
is
applicable
to
section
7(b),
the
reserves
were
depleted
before
this
court’s
decision
in
the
phillips
case
and
the
commission
then
applied
the
act
as
if
hewitt
and
dougherty
had
complied
with
section
7(b).
united
and
the
commission
seek
to
distinguish
these
cases
on
the
grounds
that
they
arose
out
of
previously
unannounced
points
of
law.
yet
in
the
plaquemines
case,
the
filing
should
have
been
made
after
the
commission
announced
that
it
had
jurisdiction
under
the
(inaudible)
case.
similarly,
in
ellwood
a
part
of
the
refunds
and
a
substantial
part
of
the
refunds
were
incurred
after
the
commission
asserted
jurisdiction
and
what
ultimately
became
the
(inaudible)
before
this
court.
in
highlands,
the
party
failing
to
file
was
simply
relying
on
commission
regulations
and
here
the
court
of
appeals
observed
that
there
were
no
cases,
which
dealt
with
similar
factual
circumstances.
so,
the
common
thread
of
all
these
cases
is
that
the
party
failing
to
file
was
in
good
faith
and
once
you’ve
made
that
finding
then
you
proceed
to
retroactively
apply
the
act
as
if
the
party
had
complied
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
at
the
proper
time.
concerning
the
issue
of
good
faith,
the
courts
have
required
more
than
mere
ignorance
of
the
law
or
mere
inadvertence
in
filing.
in
each
case
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
this
case,
the
party
failing
to
file
was
aware
of
the
filing
requirement,
but
the
facts,
there
were
facts
and
circumstances
in
each
case
which
made
the
party
believe
in
good
faith
that
those
filing
requirements
were
inapplicable.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
first
stressed
extensively
the
facts
relating
to
haring’s
good
faith
and
why
he
felt
it
was
unnecessary
to
file.
thus
in
1966,
when
haring
acquired
the
butler
b
lease,
there
was
one
well
on
that
lease,
which
was
not
producing.
haring
attempted
to
restore
production
by
diligent
efforts,
but
was
unsuccessful.
both
the
buyer
and
the
seller
recognized
that
there
could
be
no
more
gas
produced
and
this
was
contrary
to
their
wishes.
united
removed
its
equipment
and
haring
believed
that
the
contract
was
at
an
end.
haring
was
a
petroleum
geologist
and
as
i
had
stated
testified
that
in
1966
neither
he
nor
anyone
else
knew
of
any
further
gas
reserves.
haring
believed
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
file
the
papers
which
the
court
observed
could
in
view
of
the
facts
had
only
been
for
the
purpose
of
tidying
up
the
records.
since
haring
believed,
the
1953
contract
had
been
ended,
he
had
not
inform
mccombs
about
it.
mccombs
acquired
his
interest
in
the
butler
b
lease
relying
on
the
1967
title
opinion,
which
failed
to
mention
the
1953
contract.
mccombs
was
therefore
unaware
that
haring
had
not
filed
with
the
commission
until
the
hearings
before
the
commission
in
this
case.
as
further
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
i
think
they
should
be
a
matter
of
record
your
honor,
but
in
most
states
the
abandonment
orders
of
the
commission
are
un-recordable
and
indeed
inquiry
to
the
commission
would
prove
useless,
for
the
reason
that
the
commission’s
records
are
not
kept
so
that
the
commission
can
–-
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
yes.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
that
was
my
point
your
honor,
inquiry
to
the
commission
would
be
fruitless
for
the
reason
that
the
commissions
records
are
not
kept
in
a
manner
so
that
it
can
be
determined
whether
abandonment
has
been
granted
with
respect
to
any
particular
tract.
and
indeed,
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
commission’s
opinion
below
indicates
that
the
commission
has
destroyed
its
records
of
a
certain
advantage
as
of
1964,
so
that
nothing
can
be
told
about
records
of
that
advantage.
as
evidence
of
haring’s
good
faith
and
belief
that
he
did
not
have
to
file,
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
united
also
did
not
believe
that
they
had
to
file,
although
this
court
in
the
united
case
decided
in
the
same
year,
1966,
had
said
that
section
7(b)
is
equally
applicable
to
the
purchaser.
thus
the
united
witness
testified
that
he
didn’t
believe
it
was
necessary.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn’t
understand.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
at
the
time
your
honor
the
cost
would
not
have
been
great
for
the
reason
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
your
honor
although
the
harings
failed
to
file
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
it
would
not
have
been
costly
at
that
time
to
file
your
honor
for
the
reason
that
the
commission
withheld
processed
the
abandonment
papers
and
did
not
hold
a
formal
hearing,
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
it.
the
court
of
appeals
observations
were
based
on
the
statement
of
facts
which
were
contained
in
opinion
740.
the
commission
however
did
more
than
state
facts
concerning
good
faith.
it
made
an
express
finding
in
paragraph
71
that
mccombs
and
haring
were
not
willful.
in
view
of
haring’s
testimony
that
he
was
not
merely
ignorant
of
the
requirement,
but
that
he
consulted
his
lawyer
and
both
of
them
thought
it
was
unnecessary
to
file,
i
think
that
this
holding
is
another
way
of
saying
that
the
respondents
before
the
commission
is
in
good
--
were
in
good
faith.
moreover
the
administrative
law
judge
made
his
own
findings
of
innocence
and
good
faith
which
in
view
of,
which
were
not
accepted
to
and
in
view
of
the
commission’s
regs
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
well,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
well,
your
honor
you
are
right,
of
course,
but
that’s
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
well,
we
would
ask
you
your
honor
to
consider
that
the
filing
--
that
haring
was
in
good
faith
in
failing
to
file
and
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
file
whereas
in
your
honor's
situation
no
one
would
believe
that
it
is
unnecessary.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
well
the
statute
very
clearly
sets
forth
that
you
have
90
days
your
honor,
whereas
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
i
don’t
think,
your
honor
and
i
pointed
out
that
the
doctrine
was
not
applicable
to
mere
inadvertence
although
ignorance
but
rather
it
is
applicable
to
a
situation
where
the
party
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
didn’t
have
to
file
and
in
this
connection
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
what
the
administrative
law
judge
thought
about
the
subject,
it
may
be
laid
to
rest
by
his
statement
on
the
record
at
the
conclusion
of
the
proceedings.
speaking
of
the
mccombs
group
he
said,
it
is
clear
to
me
that
are
equities
involved
in
this
proceeding
and
that
there
are
parties
involved
in
good
faith
and
who
proceeded
in
good
faith
without
knowledge
and
without
notice
of
the
claim
of
united
until
after
they
had
taken
certain
steps
and
actions
and
made
various
commitments
and
entered
into
various
contractual
arrangements.
we
therefore
submit
that
the
findings
of
the
commission
and
of
the
administrative
law
judge
on
the
issue
of
good
faith
are
clear
and
are
supported
by
the
substantial
evidence
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
without
notice
united
was
claiming
rights
under
its
contract
your
honor,
which
it
did
not
do
until
after
the
negotiations
with
the
united
were
over
until
and
until
year
after
mccombs
had
entered
into
his
contract
with
dupont.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
no
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
it
is
clear
because
if
you
examine
the
law
at
that
time
you
have
two
cases
which
said
that’s
the
hart
and
the
harbor
cases
before
the
fifth
and
tenth
circuit
respectively,
but
so
--
that
the
petitioner,
that
the
requirement
to
continue
deliveries
continues
down
to
the
exhausting
the
reserves
or
so
long
as
production
continues.
in
light
of
that
i
think
that
haring
could
reasonably
have
felt
that
he
didn’t
have
to
file
after
it
was
clear
to
him
that
there
were
no
further
reserves
and
that
the
reserves
which
he
had
tried
to
produce
were
totally
exhausted.
the
second
part
of
the
two-part
analysis
of
this
equitable
doctrine
is,
what
would
have
been
the
result
had
the
proper
papers
been
filed
at
the
proper
time,
that
is
when
haring’s
reserves
were
depleted.
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
doubt
on
this
because
it
observed
that
in
light
of
facts
in
1966
the
filing
could
only
have
been
for
the
purpose
of
tidying
up
the
commission’s
records.
the
commission
on
the
other
hand
refused
to
apply
the
act
retroactively,
not
because
of
the
facts
as
they
existed
in
1966,
but
rather
because
of
the
facts
as
they
existed
in
1975
when
the
commission
issued
its
order.
these
facts
were
there
in
1971
mccombs
had
discovered
the
mccaskill
field
which
lay
at
depths
of
approximately
a
mile
deeper
than
the
south
porter
field
from
which
haring
had
attempted
to
produce.
this
is
not
like
the
situation
in
which
an
iron
mine
which
has
known
deposits
becomes
economic
because
of
--
uneconomic
because
of
price
fluctuations,
but
rather
these
were
separate
and
unknown
reserves.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
commission
erred
in
this
respect
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
is
the
commission
the
wrong
evidence
in
applying
the
act
retroactively.
the
court
was
correct
in
this
because
the
required
finding
under
section
7(b)
is
that
the
available
supply
is
depleted.
and
the
facts
are
un-contradicted
as
i
mentioned
in
1966
that
the
available
supply
of
natural
gas
was
depleted.
this
finding
was
correct
in
1966
and
is
not
erroneous
today
as
the
commission
would
suggest
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
for
it
remains
true
today
that
in
1966
when
the
finding
was
required
to
be
made
and
the
papers
should
have
been
filed,
the
available
supply
of
natural
gas
was
depleted.
therefore
we
believe
the
court's
opinion
properly
understood
holds
that
the
commission
erred
in
failing
retroactively
to
apply
the
act.
this
holding
does
not,
as
the
commission
in
united
suggest
bypassed
the
commission’s
processes
or
denied
interested
parties
the
right
to
be
heard.
as
reflected
in
the
administrative
law
judge's
opinion
the
commission
issued
a
notice
of
complaint
on
october
18,
1973
inviting
any
party
desiring
to
be
heard
to
file
a
petition
to
intervene
or
to
protest.
mccombs
raised
the
issue
of
retroactive
abandonment
in
its
first
submitted
answer
filed
at
a
date
long
before
the
hearings
in
this
case
in
this
language.
this
commission
must
treat
that
which
should
have
been
done
as
having
been
done
and
should
therefore
issue
an
order
permitting
louis
h.
haring
et
al
to
abandon
their
sale
to
united
as
of
the
exhaustion
of
reserves
in
1966.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
in
the
hewitt
and
dougherty
case,
your
honor,
the
commission
applied
the
act
as
if
hewitt
and
dougherty
had
complied
with
the
act
in
1954
before
the
philips
case
was
decided.
now
in
view
of
mccombs'
answer
at
the
hearings
all
the
parties
had
opportunities
to
present
evidence
on
this
issue
and
yet
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
was
that
of
haring
and
mccombs
that
they
were
in
good
faith
and
that
in
1966,
the
available
supply
of
natural
gas
was
depleted.
nor
has
this
bypassed
the
commission’s
functions
for
the
reason
that
the
commission
was
asked
to
exercise
its
powers
under
section
7(b)
and
failed
to
do
so.
the
commission
and
united
suggest
that
they
have
had
less
than
a
full
opportunity
to
cross
examine
the
evidence
on
this
issue
and
in
response
to
this
i
would
point
to
the
record
which
contains
extensive
cross
examination
of
mccombs
and
haring’s
witnesses
before
the
commission
and
the
presentation
by
united
of
its
own
witnesses.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
no
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
--
the
application
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
the
application
of
this
doctrine
requires
a
producer
to
come
to
commission
and
to
ask
the
commission
to
exercise
its
statutory
function
under
section
7(b)
as
of
the
date
the
paper
should
have
been
filed.
now,
in
order
to
do
that,
the
producer
has
to
show
that
he
was
in
good
faith.
now,
if
the
producer
is
conspiring
to
avoid
the
requirements
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
i
would
suggest
that
in
that
case
your
honor,
the
producer
could
not
make
the
required
showing
of
good
faith
and
therefore
the
doctrine
would
not
be
applicable.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
your
honor,
it’s
a
question
of
good
faith.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
it’s
a
question
of
good
faith
in
each
case.
and
that’s
the
question
that
the
commission
to
file.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
that
the
parties
were
innocent
that
is?
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
and
we’re
in
good
faith.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
and
the
circumstances
of
that
case.
here
they
were
extensive
[voice
overlap]
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
i
don’t
think
that
would
do,
that
would
meet
the
requirement
showing
of
good
faith
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
haring
entered
in
1964.
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
no
your
honor.
that
was
not
the
only
reason,
i
think
that’s
supports
haring’s
good
faith,
but
haring’s
good
faith
was
based
on
the
fact
that
he
--
when
he
acquired
the
butler
b
lease
there
was
only
one
well
on
it
which
was
not
producing.
he
undertook
extensive
operations
in
order
to
restore
production,
which
ended
in
failure
and
he
was
the
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
the
commission
in
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
well
your
honor,
the
required
finding
is
whether
the
available
supply
was
exhausted
as
over
the
time
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
i’m
not
familiar
with
those
cases
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
stanley
l.
cunningham
it’s
the
same
as
in
any
filing
requirement.
it’s
same
as
in
the
plaquemines
case
where
there
was
a
filing
requirement,
but
the
party
was
in
good
faith
by
not
making
it,
when
he
had
failed
to
make
the
required
filing.
it’s
an
equitable
doctrine,
which
excuses
those
filings,
where
it
would
be
inequitable
to
enforce
the
requirements
of
the
act
against
the
party
who
is
in
good
faith
and
further
i
would
point
out
that
in
this
case
what
the
application
of
the
doctrine
would
impose
the
devastating
consequences
of
haring’s
good
faith
failure
upon
mccombs,
who
was
totally
innocent.
the
commission
also
your
honors,
indicates
that
something
could
have
been
added
to
these
proceedings
by
the
filing
of
an
abandonment
application
at
the
time
of
the
hearings
below.
i
believe
this
is
unnecessary
in
view
of
the
clear
answer,
which
mccombs
filed
raising
this
issue
and
i
would
further
point
to
the
commission’s
regulations,
which
contain
the
requirement,
the
information
required
to
be
set
forth
in
an
abandonment
application.
this
is
250.7
of
the
commission’s
regulations.
10
items,
name
of
seller,
name
authorized
in
docket
number,
name
of
purchaser
and
alike,
all
of
which
were
in
the
record,
in
the
proceedings
below
and
all
of
which
every
party
had
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
in
summary
on
this
point
your
honor,
the
critical
issue
is
whether
the
equities
permit
the
devastating
consequences
of
haring’s
good
faith
failure
to
file
to
be
vested
on
the
totally
innocent
third
party,
that
is
to
say
mccombs.
the
answer
to
this
must
be
no.
the
court
should
permit
the
application
of
the
equitable
doctrine,
which
we
have
urged
here,
which
is
designed
to
prevent
these
inequities
from
happening.
this
application
will
not
upset
any
regulatory
scheme
or
statutory
function
of
the
commission,
but
rather
it’s
a
matter
of
equitable
principles
addressed
to
these
particular
facts.
your
honors,
we
also
urge
an
issue,
which
does
include
statutory
interpretation,
that
is
to
say
that
the
word
service
rendered
as
set
forth
in
section
7(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act
are
to
be
accorded
their
plain
meaning
that
is
to
say
services
rendered
when
delivers
of
natural
gas
are
made
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
public
as
thereby
relied
on
the
reserves,
which
support
those
deliveries.
we
submit
that
reliance
is
at
the
heart
of
the
section
7(b)
and
therefore
when
haring
commenced
deliveries
from
his
reserve,
the
public
relied
on
the
reserves
quoting
those
deliveries
and
those
deliveries
were
therefore
within
the
scope
of
section
7(b).
however,
mccombs
reserves
which
were
almost
a
mile
deeper
and
which
were
discovered
at
a
later
time
were
not
relied
upon
by
the
public
and
are
therefore
not
within
the
scope
of
section
7(b).
we
submit
that
the
decisions
of
the
courts
show
that
neither
the
certificate
nor
the
contract,
nor
the
oil
and
gas
lease
is
a
proper
measure
of
service
rendered
under
section
7(b)
and
we
would
point
out
and
this
is
not
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
the
natural
gas
act
when
it
was
first
enacted
contained
section
7(b)
intact,
but
did
not
contain
a
certificate
provision
except
in
very
limited
circumstances
where
a
natural
gas
company
wanted
to
serve
another
market,
which
was
already
being
served
by
another
natural
gas
company.
so,
that
in
our
view
congress
did
not
intend
the
certificate
to
be
the
measure
of
section
7(b)
because
in
the
original
version
of
the
natural
gas
act,
there
was
no
certificate
provision
except
for
very
limited
circumstances.
we
believe
your
honors
that
the
pipeline
company’s
right
to
purchase
unknown
reserves
upon
which
the
public
has
not
relied
was
therefore
intended
by
congress
to
be
left
to
the
gas
purchase
contract
under
state
law.
that
concludes
my
argument.
