justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
allen,
you
mentioned
a
hearing
and
proceeding.
is
there
a
routinely
a
hearing
into
the
abandonment
applications
filed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
got
the
impression
from
the
briefs
that
normally
there’s
not
a
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
allen
i
think
your
position
is,
if
i'm
not
mistaken
that
even
if
they
did
demonstrate
to
put
the
commissioners
on
the
stand,
that
yes
we
would
have
granted
it,
you'd
still
say
they
didn’t
have
statutory
authority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
allen
may
i
ask
you
one
very
trivial
question?
assume
the
property
really
had
been
exhausted
and
they
never
found
any
gas
and
somebody
doesn’t
file
an
abandonment
application,
is
there
any
practical
adverse
consequence
for
his
failure
to
do
so
or
is
the
only
adverse
consequence
that
you
have
this
problem
if
you
do
later
discover
gas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
is
a
significant
consequence
in
itself,
i
just
wonder
anything
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can
see
how
the
commission
might
want
to
kind
of
clean
up
and
keep
it’s
files
current
or
something
of
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
any
sanction
on
the
operator?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cunningham,
under
your
theory
should
not
the
commission
have
been
directed
to
hold
the
hearing
that
was
never
held,
because
he
didn’t
file
at
the
right
time
and
that’s
not
what
the
court
of
appeals
ordered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn’t
make
all
these
findings.
they
didn’t
find
that
they
would
have
granted
the
abandonment
if
the
petitioner
had
filed
in
time,
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
what
i’m
saying
is
that
if
your
theory
were
correctly
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals,
should
not
the
court
of
appeals
have
remanded
the
matter
to
the
commission
with
directions
to
hold
a
hearing
and
decide
what
it
would
have
decided
in
1966,
if
a
timely
application
had
been
filed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you’re
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
as
a
fact
that
this
is
true
and
it
is
so
clear
that
we
know
that
the
commission
would
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
if
they
had
a
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
didn’t
move
well,
that’s
not
the
standard
of
review
of
course,
just
contrary
to
the
evidence,
there
had
been
no
substantial
evidence
supporting
the
contrary
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
notice
of
united’s
claim,
but
does
that
show
--
does
that
say
they
didn’t
know
that
the
statute
said
or
they
didn’t
get
a
form
that
said
you
have
a
file
a
petition
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn’t
this
--
the
statutory
language
pretty
clear
in
this
case,
isn’t
that
the
big
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
hewitt
and
dougherty
in
latter
category?
