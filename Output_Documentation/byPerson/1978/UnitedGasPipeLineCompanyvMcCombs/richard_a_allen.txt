mr.
richard
a.
allen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
the
holding
that
respondents
and
their
predecessors
in
interest
had
lawfully
abandoned
the
service
of
delivering
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce
even
though
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
had
never
authorized
the
abandonment
under
section
7(b)
natural
gas
act.
section
7(b)
of
the
act
provides
that
natural
gas
company
may
abandon
the
service
within
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
“without
permission
and
approval
of
the
commission
first
had
and
obtained
after
due
hearing
and
a
finding
by
the
commission
that
the
available
supply
of
natural
gas
is
depleted
to
the
extent
the
continuation
of
service
is
unwarranted
or
that
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
or
necessity
permits
abandonment.”
to
summarize
the
pertinent
facts;
in
1948
w.
r.
quin
acquired
an
oil
and
gas
lease
of
attractive
land
in
texas
known
as
the
butler
b
tract.
in
1953,
his
widow
and
successor
in
interest
b.
quin
entered
into
a
gas
sales
contract
with
the
united
gas
pipe
line
company
under
which
mrs.
quin
undertook
to
sell
to
united
all
merchantable
natural
gas
produced
from
“all
wells
now
or
hereafter
drilled
during
the
term
of
the
contract
on
a
number
tracks
including
butler
b.”
in
1954,
mrs.
quin
applied
for
and
received
from
the
commission,
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
authorizing
the
sales
of
gas
as
provided
for
in
the
contract.
subsequently,
the
lease
was
assigned
several
times.
in
one
subsequent
assignment
amended
the
certificate
--
amended
the
contract
with
the
united
to
extent
its
term
to
1981
and
obtained
a
certificate
from
the
commission
that
authorized
the
service
as
proposed
in
the
amended
certificate
--
in
the
amended
contract
and
replacing
the
certificate
that
was
originally
issued
to
mrs.
quin.
before
1966,
one
well
on
butler
b
produced
natural
gas
that
was
delivered
to
united
under
the
contract.
in
1966,
the
then
assignee
of
the
lease
informed
united
that
there
was
--
that
the
well
was
not
producing
any
more
gas
and
that
no
further
gas
would
be
available
at
that
time.
no
gas
was
produced
from
property
for
five
years
and
during
that
time
no
one
applied
to
the
commission
for
authority
to
abandon
service
under
section
7(b).
in
1971,
the
assignee
haring
assigned
part
of
his
interest
in
the
butler
b
tract
to
the
respondents.
they
drilled
a
deeper
well
on
butler
b,
discovered
more
gas
and
entered
into
a
contract
to
sell
that
gas
to
a
dupont
plant
in
texas
that
is
in
intrastate
commerce.
in
1973,
united
asserted
a
right
to
that
gas
under
its
1953
contract
as
amended.
and
united
--
respondents
denied
that
the
united
had
any
right
to
the
gas
and
united
filed
a
complaint
with
the
commission,
which
commenced
these
proceedings.
in
the
proceeding
before
commission,
respondent’s
principle
claim
was
that
the
original,
the
contracts
with
the
united
and
the
certificates
from
the
commission
dedicated
only
the
gas
that
was
produced
from
the
first
well
that
was
drilled
on
the
property
that
is
the
well
that
was
drilled
before
1966,
but
not
gas
produced
from
the
well
that
they
had
subsequently
drilled.
respondents
also
suggested
to
the
commission
that
even
if
the
gas
they
were
currently
producing
was
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce,
the
commission
should
grant
them
abandonment
authority
nunc
pro
tunc
or
retroactively
in
1966
when
production
from
the
first
well
had
ceased.
the
commission
held
that
the
certificates
issued
to
respondent’s
predecessors
dedicated
all
the
gas
produced
from
the
butler
b
tract
and
thus
imposed
upon
respondents
an
obligation
under
the
natural
gas
act
to
continue
supplying
that
gas
in
the
interstate
commerce
to
united.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
supply
of
gas
under
butler
b
was
concededly
not
depleted,
the
commission
also
denied
respondent's
suggestion
that
the
grant
abandonment
nunc
pro
tunc
to
1966.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
the
ground
that
the
facts
of
this
case,
established
abandonment
as
a
matter
of
law
even
though
the
commission
had
never
granted
abandonment.
particularly
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
fact
that
production
had
ceased
from
during
the
period
1966
to
1971
that
the
parties
during
that
period
seem
to
believe
that
there
was
no
more
gas
on
the
property
and
that
the
commission
probably
would
have
granted
an
abandonment
application
if
one
had
been
filed
in
that
period.
those
facts
the
court
concluded
made
it
necessary
for
respondents
to
comply
with
the
requirements
to
section
7(b)
which
forbids
abandonment
without
obtaining
approval
from
the
commission
and
until
the
commission
finds
appropriate
facts
in
an
appropriate
hearing
and
proceeding.
in
the
court’s
view,
the
facts
believed
to
be
true
in
1966
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
there
is
not
routinely
a
hearing.
the
statute
mr.
stevens
--
justice
stevens
provides
for
a
due
hearing,
where
there
is
an
abandonment
application
and
all
of
the
interested
parities
were
notified
and
the
application
itself
demonstrates
depletion
of
supply
and
the
interested
parties
are
concurring
that
there’s
usually
not
a
hearing.
but
where
there
is
some
dispute
there
will
be
hearing.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
normally
there’s
not
a
hearing.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
but
in
any
of
that
commission
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
view,
the
facts
that
were
believed
to
be
true
in
1966
made
the
commission's
participation
in
the
abandonment
process
unnecessary.
our
position
is
the
court
of
appeals
holding
is
contrary
to
the
plain
terms
of
section
7(b).
in
this
case,
the
commission
never
approved
abandonment
and
never
made
any
of
the
fact
findings
that
abandonment
would
be
warranted
and
indeed
no
one
ever
sought
the
commission’s
approval
for
abandonment
at
the
time
that
those
findings
might
have
been
made.
the
court’s
holdings
thus
violates
the
plain
language
of
section
7(b)
and
it
also
violates
the
general
principle
of
administrative
law
that
a
court
is
not
empowered
to
make
findings
of
fact
or
engage
in
functions
that
a
statute
entrusts
exclusively
to
an
administrative
agency.
the
court’s
holding
that
the
facts
of
this
case
established
abandonment
also
violates
the
specific
objectives
of
section
7(b)
in
at
least
three
respects.
first,
section
7(b)
serves
to
ensure
that
the
commission
and
all
other
interested
parties
will
have
an
opportunity
at
relevant
time
to
examine
the
facts
bearing
on
abandonment.
the
court’s
holding
would
deprive
them
of
that
opportunity
because
the
court
found
abandonment
on
the
basis
of
facts
that
appeared
to
be
true
in
1966,
but
they
were
never
examined
by
the
commission,
by
united
or
any
other
interested
party
in
the
kind
of
proceeding
that
section
7(b)
requires.
second;
congress
in
section
7(b)
entrusted
the
commission
as
the
expert
agency.
the
task
of
making
the
determinations
of
facts
pertaining
to
abandonment
such
as
the
alleged
depletion
of
gas
supplies.
the
court’s
holding
on
the
other
hand
would
authorize
courts
to
make
and
to
examine
those
facts
and
to
determine
those
facts
wholly
independently
of
the
commission.
for
example,
if
it
would
authorize
courts
in
this
kind
of
case
to
determine
whether
the
geological
evidence
known
or
available
in
19
--
or
discoverable
in
1966
supported
respondent’s
predecessor's
assertion
that
the
gas
supply
was
depleted.
third,
section
7(b)
provides
necessary
certainty
in
the
entire
regulatory
system,
by
providing
that
only
the
commission
can
grant
lawful
abandonment.
producers,
pipelines,
purchasers,
another
interested
parties
have
someway
of
knowing
whether
gas
from
acreage
that
was
once
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce,
remains
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce.
under
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
such
persons
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
that
gas
remains
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce,
because
some
court
in
the
future
might
find
that
some
previous
state
of
facts
established
a
lawful
abandonment,
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
any
commission
action.
now
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
fact
established
lawful
abandonment
appears
to
have
been
based
in
part
on
its
view
that
if
an
application
had
been
filed
with
the
commission
in
1966,
the
commission
probably
would
have
granted
it.
and
the
respondents
emphasized
that
notion
in
their
brief
to
this
court
by
arguing
primarily
that
because
the
commission
would
have
granted
an
abandonment
application
in
1966,
the
commission
erred
as
a
matter
of
law
in
failing
to
grant
abandonment
nunc
pro
tunc
in
1975,
nunc
pro
tunc
to
1966.
there
are
two
answers
to
that
contention.
first;
it
has
no
basis
in
fact.
no
one
knows
what
the
commission
would
have
done
if
an
abandonment
application
had
been
filed
in
1966.
no
application
was
filed
and
therefore
no
one
had
any
occasion
or
reason
to
examine
the
facts
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
and
the
commission
is
different,
that’s
absolutely
correct,
but
in
any
event
no
one
had
any
opportunity
to
examine
the
facts
in
the
kind
of
proceeding
that
section
7(b)
contemplates.
moreover
we
know
now
that
the
supply
gas
was
in
fact
not
depleted
and
it
seems
very
strange
to
assume
that
the
commission
would
have
made
a
finding
that
we
now
know
to
be
false.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
absolutely
that
would
be
our
second
and
principle
argument.
the
notion
that
the
commission
would
have
granted,
respondent’s
contention
that
the
commission
would
have
granted
abandonment
in
1966
is
totally
irrelevant.
in
fact
it
reflects
a
rather
startling
proposition
of
law
that
few
regulatory
agencies
could
operate
under.
in
effect,
it
would
mean
that
anytime
a
statute
requires
agency
authorization
for
an
action,
such
as
a
certificate
to
operate
an
airline
or
license
to
sell
alcoholic
beverages,
a
person
who
was
charged
with
failing
to
obtain
that
authorization
would
have
a
defense,
a
legal
defense
that
if
he
had
applied
to
the
agency
at
some
previous
and
proper
time,
the
agency
probably
would
have
given
him
the
authority.
in
essence
that’s
what
respondents’
position
boils
down
to.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
would
put
a
tremendous
premium
on
such
activity
your
honor.
now
respondent
is
trying
to
buttress
this
argument
by
arguing
that
haring’s
failure
to
apply
for
an
abandonment
application
was
“good
faith.”
it's
hard
to
see
on
this
record
what
they
mean
by
good
faith
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
secretary
of
the
commission
during
this
period
of
non-production,
twice
wrote
letters
to
the
respondent’s
predecessors
and
once
to
haring
saying
that
if
no
further
sales
are
contemplated
from
this
property,
it's
going
to
be
necessary
for
you
to
file
an
abandonment
application
and
further
more
it's
going
to
be
necessary
for
you
to
submit
a
statement
of
united
with
respect
to
it’s
position
on
abandonment.
haring
nevertheless
conceded
in
his
testimony
in
this
proceeding
that
he
nevertheless
made
the
determination
that
it
wasn’t
necessary
and
he
didn’t
do
it.
in
conclusion,
i’d
like
to
stress
what
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
cases.
namely
that
section
7(b)
is
of
key
important
to
the
commissions’
regulatory
responsibilities
under
the
natural
gas
act.
although
the
commission
makes
every
effort
to
do
so
to
monitor
service
obligations
under
the
act,
there
is
no
way
that
it
can
keep
track
of
the
performance
of
every
gas
sales
contract
that
it
certificates
under
the
act.
in
some
cases
deliveries
under
such
contracts
may
fluctuate
from
day-to-day
or
even
from
year-to-year
and
in
some
cases
production
may
cease
and
resume
several
time
for
any
number
of
reasons,
but
unless
somebody
complains
to
the
commission,
the
commission
has
absolute
enforcement
and
assurance
that
the
service
obligations
will
be
complied
with
is
extremely
difficult,
if
not
impossible.
section
7(b)
is
critical
to
the
commission’s
enforcement
powers
because
as
this
court
recognized
in
sunray
mid-continent
oil
company.
it
ensures
that
the
commission
keeps
legal
control
over
service
obligations
even
though
the
physical
facts
may
be
beyond
its
physical
control.
thus
for
example
if
it
discovers
that
a
producer
is
selling
gas
in
intrastate
commerce
for
sometime
that
it
was
dedicated
to
intrastate
commerce,
it
may
--
and
the
producer
claims
that
well
at
some
prior
period
there
had
been
cessation
of
production
and
i
thought
my
obligation
had
lapsed,
the
commission
can
say
if
you
thought
that
the
supply
of
gas
was
depleted
at
some
prior
time,
you
should
have
come
to
us
then
to
prove
it.
but
since
you
didn’t
your
service
obligation
and
your
legal
service
obligation
remains,
that’s
essential
to
the
commission’s
responsibilities
under
the
act.
in
larger
measure
we
submit
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
undermine
that
regulatory
authority.
with
respect
to
the
other
points
made
by
respondents
in
their
brief,
i’d
like
to
rely
on
our
brief
on
our
reply
brief
and
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
as
far
as
i
can
see
this
is
the
only
significant
adverse
consequence.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
there
might
be
the
commission’s
ability
to
monitor
reserves
of
natural
gas
and
the
commission
may
have
some
particular
reasons
to
enforce
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well
that’s
right
and
if
somebody
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well
if
an
operator
willfully
refused
to
file
an
abandonment
application
as
he
was
required
to,
the
commission
might
have
some
regulatory
reasons
to
take
sanctions
against
him,
even
though
his
supply
had
depleted.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
basis,
whatever
in
law
or
facts
for
respondent's
claim
that
their
alleged
“good
faith”
requires
the
commission
to
grant
them
nunc
pro
tunc
abandonment.
their
claim
of
“good
faith”
that
comes
down
even
if
you
accept
it
to
be
true
simply
to
an
ordinary
mistake
of
law
and
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
if
your
lawyer
tells
you,
you
don’t
have
to
file
a
petition
for
certiorari
on
time
or
you
don’t
have
to
get
a
drivers
license
or
you
don’t
have
to
do
anything
else
that
statutes
require
you
to
do,
that
is
no
excuse
for
not
doing
that
that
you
are
--
the
statutory
requirements
remain
in
force.
furthermore,
there
is
no
basis
for
respondent's
suggestion
that
it
is
difficult
for
producers
to
find
out
whether
the
commission
is
certificated
particular
gas
sales
contracts.
as
mr.
bemis
pointed
out,
the
contracts
are
typically
recorded
in
the
recorder
of
deeds
office
and
any
person
searching
a
title
will
find
the
contract
would
have
no
difficulty
going
to
the
pipeline
to
determine
or
to
the
commission
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
certificate
authorizing
that
service
and
whether
there
has
been
an
abandonment
order
issued
with
respect
to
it.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
believe
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
they
are
filed
with
the
lease.
the
lease
must
be
filed
in
gas
sales;
typically
a
gas
sales
contract
will
be
filed
together
with
the
lease
to
reflect
an
encumbrance
on
the
lease.
the
cases
that
the
respondents
rely
on
for
their
alleged
good
faith
argument
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
his
argument
was
–
as
i
understand
that
the
commission
is
required
as
a
matter
of
law
and
was
required
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
court
can
require
the
commission.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
it
is
not
entirely
clear
what
his
position
is,
but
if
he
says
that’s
the
law,
then
presumably
the
court
would
have
to.
the
cases
on
which
he
relies
are
completely
distinguishable,
they
involve
two
situations.
the
first
situation
is
where
somebody
has
failed
to
comply
with
statutory
requirements
and
in
order
to
make
he
doesn’t
get
away
with
evading
the
statutory
obligations,
the
commission
has
to
make
a
assumption
that
what
he
did,
he
did
in
fact
what
he
should
have
done.
the
other
situation
is
where
a
person
does
not
do
something
and
there
is
reasonable
reliance
on
the
existence
of
the
state
of
law
at
that
time
and
then
subsequently
there
is
a
change
in
the
state
of
law.
for
example;
in
1954,
when
this
court
first
determined
and
held
that
producer
contracts
were
subject
to
the
natural
gas
act
to
producer
activities,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
in
that
later
category
where
there
had
been
a
cessation
of
production
before
1954
and
of
course
the
person
did
not
file
for
an
abandonment
application,
because
nobody
thought
he
was
subject
to
the
act.
