justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
commission
is
different.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
cunningham
how
far
back
does
the
(inaudible)
run?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean
will
it
go
back
that
long?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
say
that
this
could
send
us
into
--
should
have
been
done
40
years
ago
as
hadn’t
been
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
would
it
have
cost
to
have
filed
this
abandonment
approximately?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
in
a
united
states
dollars
and
cents
would
it
approximately
cost
to
carry
through
and
abandon
the
proceedings
in
the
1960s?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
in
the
world
do
we
have
to
bend
all
of
the
law
around
to
protect
a
company
with
counsel
who
deliberately
didn’t
follow
the
rule.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
want
to
give
you
a
break
there,
it
will
cost
you
so
much
money,
but
you
can’t
even
help
me
with
that,
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
if
you
in
complete
innocence
and
in
good
faith
to
fail
file
your
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
on
time,
what
happens
to
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
all
the
good
faith
in
the
world,
what
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
don’t
want
to
bend
it
over
either?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
mine
is
that
you
thought
you
had
91
days
and
you
only
had
90.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
in
good
faith.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
little
hypothetical
mr.
cunningham?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
got
a
commission
in
existence
now
that
everybody
knows
would
not
give
an
abandonment
to
anybody
under
certain
conditions.
so
wouldn’t
it
be
better
not
to
apply
and
wait
for
another
commission.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
i
would
do,
what
i
suggest
that
i
would
do,
i
wouldn’t
tell
anybody
that
was
the
reason
i
would
do
it,
would
i?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
i
put
on
10
years
later,
i
put
on
a
lawyer
that
said,
we
didn’t
just
think
you
needed
abandonment
and
lawyers
they
said
exactly
what
the
lawyer
said
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
be
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
that
the
lawyer
said
exactly
what
these
lawyers
said.
wouldn’t
the
law
judge
say
exactly
what
this
law
judge
said?
if
not,
you’re
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
only
facts
are
that
they
should
have
applied
but
they
didn’t.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
other
requirements
do
you
have
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
all
i
heard
you
say
was
that
the
lawyer
said
it
wasn’t
necessary
to
file
this
piece
of
paper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
about
the
fact
that
you
can
shop
around
for
commission?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
can’t
you
wait
until
you
get
a
commission
that
likes
mccomb?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
haven’t
there
been
cases
where
they
held
up
on
trade
commission
cases
until
the
whole
commission
changed
by
delaying
tactics?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
in
the
world
do
you
think
they
passed
the
rule
that
you
had
to
file
for
this,
if
you
didn’t
have
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
allen
i
think
i
didn’t
understand
say
the
court
had
did
by
his
argument.
his
argument
was
that
the
court
could
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
says
the
court
can
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it
is
a
little
dirty
to
say
the
court
has
to.
