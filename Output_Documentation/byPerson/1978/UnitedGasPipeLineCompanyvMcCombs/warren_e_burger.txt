do
you
think
that
might
put
a
premium
on
having
some
lawyers
go
around
pursing
mr.
justice
marshall’s
suggestion
and
get
affidavits
from
the
former
members
of
the

as

do

around

this
has
happened
with
coal
mines
for
example,
hasn't
it?
coal
mines
have
been
not
regulated
as
these
are,
they
have
abandoned
and
then
when
the
price
of
steel,
i
should
i
have
said
iron
mines,
iron
mines
when
the
price
of
steel
went
up
it
became
economic
to
operate
what
previously
were
an
abandoned
mine,
abandoned
because
it
was
not
economic
to
operate?

isn’t
that
episode
with
one
of
the
good
indications
why
these
abandonments
should
always
be
a
matter
of
records,
so
that
your
title
examiner
can
know
what
the
situation
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
you
say
they’re
un-recordable
under
state
law
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
a
careful
examiner
when
he’s
dealing
with
this
kind
of
property
isn’t
going
to
rely
just
on
the
registered
deeds
or
the
registrar
whatever
it
maybe,
he
is
going
to
communicate
with
the
commission,
isn’t
he?

you
gentleman.
