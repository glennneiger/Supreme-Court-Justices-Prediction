happen
--
justice
thurgood

can
you
conceive
of
a
case
between
g1eneral
ferguson,
general
motors
and
general
electric
under
the
supremacy
clause
under

justice
thurgood
marshall
my
answer
to
justice
white
was
supremacy
1343
automatically,
you
don't
really
mean
that
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
the
hague
versus
cio
decide
about
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
those
state
courts
can
give
a
federal
court
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
those
state
courts
nor
you
can
give
the
federal
court
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall

you're
saying
that
the
state

in
new
jersey
give
us
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
give
me
the
decision
of
any
court
that
said
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
apply
to
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
is
it
that
a
federal
judge
can
read
english
better
than
a
state
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
the
constitution
written
in
english?
justice
thurgood
marshall
only
if
you
say
that
federal
judges
understand
the
constitution
better
than
state
judges?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
do
you
also
think
the
state
judges
are
better
able
to
understand
state
laws
than
federal
judges?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall

if
you
do
please
join
us
on
the
several
case,
will
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
if
i
tell
you
to
know
your
theory
that
a
federal
judge
knows
more
federal
law
than
a
state
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
huh?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
date
that
he
arise
on
the
bench?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
fact,
urging
to
get
to
that
point
where
you're
going
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
civil
rights
is
just
surplusage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
is
it
there?
you
don't
--
you
say
you
don't
need
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
need
civil
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall

justice
thurgood

that
for
you
to
win?
justice

--

justice

marshall
1983.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,

we're

about
civil
rights.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
deprivation
of
civil
rights
is
going
to
say
that
about
80
million
times?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don't
--
we
have
to
find
that
denial
of
welfare
is
a
denial
of
rights
guaranteed
by
1983?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
want
to
agree
with
that
1983,
you
don't
want
to
agree
to
that?
