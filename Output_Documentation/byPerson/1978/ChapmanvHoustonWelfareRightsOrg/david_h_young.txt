mr.
david
h.
young
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
dispute
in
this
case
arises
as
a
result
of
a
march
1st,
1973
conversion
that
the
state
of
texas
department
of
--
what
was
then
known
as
department
of
public
welfare
made
in
the
methods
and
procedures
that
it
used
to
calculate
a
standard
of
need
in
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
program.
states
are
permitted
by
section
601
in
title
42
that
section
401
of
the
social
security
act
to
define
the
standard
of
need
that
they
will
utilize
in
the
afdc
program
and
this
court
has
frequently
stated
and
restated
ever
since
king
against
smith
that
states
have
that
latitude.
before,
the
march
1st,
1973
conversion,
the
state's
method
of
determining
an
individual's
need
for
afdc
went
through
the
four
steps.
first,
a
maximum
standard
of
need
was
established
which
is
not
in
dispute.
second,
a
personal
needs
allowance,
a
shelter
allowance
and
a
utilities
allowance
were
combined
that
portion
is
in
dispute.
third,
they
percentage
reduction
factor
was
applied
and
fourth,
the
amount
of
any
none
exempt
income
was
deducted
from
the
--
what
was
referred
to
this
has
recognized
needs
which
was
a
product
to
those
first
three
steps.
much
of
that,
of
course
was
outlined
in
your
prior
decision
in
jefferson
against
hackney.
the
problem
arises
because
of
one
step
that
texas
went
through
with
regard
to
the
shelter
and
utilities
allowances
that
it
allowed
to
be
included
in
the
standard
of
need
that
were
being
perforation.
the
method
that
texas
used
was
to
count
the
number
of
individuals
in
the
household
without
regard
whether
they
were
eligible
or
not.
and
then
subtract
the
appropriate
per
capita
share
for
those
people
who
were
determined
to
be
ineligible.
after
march
1st,
1973,
texas
has
conversion
provided
for
a
flat
grant
system.
there's
essentially
no
longer
any
dispute
in
this
case
that
texas
can
have
a
flat
grants
that
other
states
can
have
a
flat
grants.
the
shelter
and
utilities
figures
that
texas
used
and
that
from
which
this
lawsuit
comes
were
consolidated
with
the
personal
needs
figure
and
average.
neither
the
consolidation
per
se
nor
the
averaging
is
an
issue
what
the
state
did
under
the
new
system
was
say
that
you
get
so
many
dollars
per
eligible
recipient
rather
than
the
former
method
of
taking
all
the
individuals
in
the
household
and
then
backing
out
a
per
capita
share
for
those
who
were
determined
to
be
ineligible.
i
think
simply
so
i
characterized
the
new
method
is
just
simple
addition
you
add
up
the
numbers
for
the
eligible
people
there
whereas
before
you
added
up
numbers
for
everyone
and
then
back
out
a
share
for
the
ineligible
and
that's
the
perforation.
it's
important
--
mr.
david
h.
young
i
hope
to
demonstrate
there
is
no
practical
difference.
but
it
has
been
widely
assumed
that
there
is
and
that
is
enlarged
part
of
basis
for
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
and
i'm
seeking
an
overturn.
it
is
important
in
that
regard
to
keep
perforation
and
economies
of
scale
is
separate
questions.
there's
no
dispute
that
the
state
can
utilize
economy's
scale
in
establishing
its
need
standards.
economy's
of
scale
by
the
way
is
not
a
justification
for
perforation
despite
the
contention
that
occasionally
occurs
that
economy's
scale
is
just
another
way
of
saying
the
state
assumes
the
availability
of
income
and
runs
contrary
to
everything
the
court
has
said
since
king
against
smith.
in
the
district
court,
respondents
file
suit
against
the
new
system
saying,
one,
that
it
violated
section
602
(a)
(23)
or
the
cost
of
living
increase
requirement
of
the
social
security
act
to
use
a
flat
grant.
the
flat
grant
being
what
i
described
is
just
a
simple
addition
of
the
average
numbers
rather
than
the
former
method
of
establishing
a
figure
for
individual
needs.
and
also
alleged
that
the
state's
new
system
violated
602
(a)
(7)
which
is
the
provision
that
requires
the
states
to
deduct
available
income.
606
(b)
which
has
to
do
is
whether
or
not
the
states
can
make
restrictive
payments
and
which
we
say
is
not
an
issue
here
and
602
(a)
(23)
which
is
the
cost
of
living
requirement.
they
said
that
by
including
the
prorated
members
will
obscured
the
standard
of
need
and
therefore
do
not
give
a
true
cost
of
living
raises
required
by
602
(a)
(23).
the
district
court
took
jurisdiction
of
the
alleged
social
security
act
violations
under
28
u.s.c.
13434.
and
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
--
and
they
were
required
to
judge
view
was
required
to
by
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
gomez
against
florida
employment
service.
the
rights
involved
which
were
found
to
be
cognizable
under
13434
were
rights
at
the
fifth
circuit
characterizes
rights
of
an
essentially
personal
nature
referring
to
the
need
to
have
food,
the
need
to
have
a
shelter
a
place
to
live
and
things
such
as
this.
but
the
district
court
found
far
that
your
petitioner
is
here
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
after
the
district
court
entered
its
opinion,
the
respondents
here
attempted
to
reopen
and
amend
their
case
to
raise
a
constitutional
issue.
they
have
not
alleged
any
constitutional
issue
to
the
time
the
district
court
made
its
decision.
however,
in
considering
their
motions
to
reopen
and
motions
for
live
to
amend
the
court
said
that
the
demands
of
its
docket
do
not
allow
a
party
who
has
had
its
civilian
court
to
restructure
and
replead
its
case
merely
because
it
is
obtained
in
adverse
decision.
mr.
david
h.
young
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
the
general
practice
where
effectively
a
jurisdictional
basis
or
pleading
are
allowed
to
be
amended
at
some
time
during
the
appellate
process
it
is
where
the
superior
court
and
the
appellate
court
is
looking
for
an
alternative
means
to
uphold
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that's
already
been
made.
and
in
this
case,
the
district
court
said
that
they
not
only
had
and
raise
it
or
briefed
it
or
argued
it
but
that
there
was
no
proof
in
the
record
to
support
what
the
district
court
took
to
be
their
due
process
claim
but
which
was
not
characterizes
due
process
or
anything
else
in
their
motions
for
leave
to
amend
their
reopen.
mr.
david
h.
young
yes.
mr.
david
h.
young
that
you
certainly
where
he
is.
i
hope
to
speak
for
a
very
little
but
--
mr.
david
h.
young
that
certainly
an
issue
--
mr.
david
h.
young
well,
that
is
how
it's
characterized,
yes.
mr.
david
h.
young
i
don't
subscribe
to
it.
mr.
david
h.
young
i
have.
mr.
david
h.
young
yes.
what
i
meant
by
that
is
that
when
i
did
my
petition
for
certiorari
you'll
notice
that
all
that
was
available
to
me
as
to
gonzalez
against
young
was
a
short
summary
in
united
states
law
weaken
my
petition
was
based
on
andrews
against
maher
and
randall
v.
goldmark
subsequently
and
prior
to
the
preparation
of
my
brief
and
did
obtain
a
copy
of
gonzales
against
young
and
alexandria.
i
hope
to
come
in
on
the
respondent's
petition
about
it
but
i
cannot
improve
on
or
share
any
additional
light.
i
think
really
on
the
rational
that
the
third
circuit
is
and
i
just
stand
on
it
with
the
state
of
new
jersey.
to
the
extent
it
addresses
the
issue
i
raise
which
is
13434
not
13433.
the
--
and
with
regard
to
that
distinction
between
the
two
possible
basis
for
jurisdiction,
the
fifth
circuit
found
with
the
district
court
that
it
was
subsection
4
which
was
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
not
subsection
3
and
they
declined
to
find
the
existence,
excuse
me.
now,
the
subsection
3
claim
even
though
by
that
time
it
arguably
been
briefed
by
respondents
in
the
district
court
and
it
have
been
repeatedly
urged
as
a
method
to
reopen
the
whole
case
and
was
sought
to
--
by
them
to
be
considered
by
the
fifth
circuit.
fifth
circuit
said,
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
we
have
a
subsection
4
case.
but
they
did
on
one
issue
in
the
merits
overturn
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
perforation
question
and
say
that
perforation
was
an
impermissible
assumption
of
income
except
when
the
recipient
lives
with
none
dependent
relatives
in
the
later
shelter.
my
petition
for
certiorari
was
intentionally
and
knowingly
limited
to
as
to
jurisdiction
13434.
i
also
alleged
that
the
fifth
circuit
fail
to
appreciate
this
court's
opinion
in
jefferson
against
hackney
where
is
considered
what
the
real
requirements
of
602
(a)
(23)
were
and
determine
that
texas
that
are
already
met
them
and
overlook
the
characterization
in
rosado
against
wyman
and
repeated
in
jefferson
that
it's
adventure
some
for
the
courts
to
attempt
to
alter
the
state's
ability
and
set
a
standard
of
need.
i
did
say
also
that
the
fifth
circuit
misinterpreted
this
court's
decision
in
van
lare
because
van
lare
really
had
to
do
with
the
substantive
of
income.
it
didn't
really
have
anything
to
do
with
the
state's
proper
calculation
of
its
standard
of
need.
i
hasn't
add
i
recognized
the
last
paragraph
in
van
lare
is
there
because
it
jumps
out
at
you
and
it's
quoted
in
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
but
then
i
will
get
to
that
later.
i
don't
think
that
that's
controlling
in
this
case.
the
respondents
say
that
subsection
3
of
1343
is
also
before
the
court
which
i
did
not
agree
but
i
will
have
to
it
after
lunch
because
it
will
be
then
and
in
gonzales
against
young.
but
they
did
agree
with
me
that
the
issue
on
the
merits
is
whether
or
not
the
state
complied
with
the
cost
of
living
increase
requirement
of
602
(a)
(23).
excuse
me.
mr.
david
h.
young
it
is,
yes.
mr.
david
h.
young
as
to
subparagraph
4.
mr.
david
h.
young
as
to
the
later
part,
yes
not
to
the
former
whether
it's
sufficient
invoke
1343(a)
jurisdiction
is
an
issue.
that
is
an
issue
because
--
mr.
david
h.
young
well,--
mr.
david
h.
young
well,
perhaps
i
wasn't
following
your
first
question.
mr.
david
h.
young
well,
i
think
the
explanation
is
the
confusion
among
the
effects
of
the
supremacy
clause
on
the
one
hand,
1983
on
the
other
hand
and
then
the
two
subsections
of
1343
plus
the
social
security
act.
these
case
has
really
arise
under
and
depend
upon
interpretations
of
the
social
security
act
none
of
the
above.
and
they
do
not
emanate
these
programs,
government
income
transfer
programs
or
neither
--
they
don't
find
their
genesis
and
either
the
supremacy
clause
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
that
in
that
shell
of
course
is
the
jurisdictional
argument
in
this
case.
i
notice
the
clock
is
running
and
i'm
taking
more
time
that
i
intended
to.
i
want
to
get
to
the
merits
because
that's
where
my
case
is
different
in
the
next
one.
i
would
assert
that
--
mr.
david
h.
young
that's
true.
that's
true,
but
i
would
feel
better
if
i
didn't
take
that
chance.
and
my
client
might
say
i
never
really
appealed
anyway.
let
me
use,
i
used
one
example
in
my
brief
on
the
merits
to
try
to
show
that
processes
it
was
applied
in
texas
to
distinguish
between
determining
need
on
the
one
hand
and
determining
amount
of
income
on
the
other
hand.
i
won't
play
for
that
now
but
i'll
try
to
show
that
there's
a
very
real
difference
between
need
and
income
per
se.
so,
let
me
talk
a
little
bit
about
establishing
the
standard
of
need
and
refer
you
to
the
ortega
family
in
this
case
which
is
the
only
of
the
original
plaintiffs
it's
still
in
the
case.
the
others
were
recipients
of
adult
assistance
program
that
are
no
longer
in
existence.
in
ortega
had
four
members
in
the
family,
two
eligible
for
afdc,
one
for
aid
to
family
and
totally
disable
in
one
wholly
ineligible.
for
four
people
if
they
had
all
been
eligible
the
shelter
allowance
would've
been
$44.00.
that's
$11.00
per
person
if
they
were
all
eligible.
the
petitioners
here
prorated
and
gave
$33.00.
the
result
would
be
the
same
if
they
had
just
established
in
$11.00
per
individual
need
figure
and
simply
added
them
up
and
disregard
it
the
ineligible
person
there
proration
doesn't
have
any
effect
at
all
unless
you
first
assume
the
state
is
obligated
to
provide
for
the
needs
of
ineligible
person.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
if
you
don't
first
assume
that
proration
has
no
effect
and
of
course
we
say
the
court
has
never
said,
we
have
to
do
that
and
you
shouldn't
not.
mr.
david
h.
young
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
after
the
consolidation
took
place
in
1973,
the
shelter
allowances
in
texas
for
one
to
two
persons
were
$33.00
for
three
to
four
persons
$44.00
and
five
or
more
$50.00.
the
ortega
household
had
four
persons
in
it
so
their
proper
shelter
allowance
would
be
$44.00
if
they
were
all
eligible.
what
the
state
did
of
course
was
prorate
and
come
up
with
a
shelter
allowance
for
that
household
of
$33.00.
i've
already
attempt
to
discuss
how
that
happens.
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
moment
to
discuss
what
the
respondent
wanted
to
have
happen
though.
there
were
two
grants
remember
in
the
household,
one
for
afdc,
one
for
aptd.
the
respondent's
desire
as
the
record
reflects
i
believe
at
page
221
that
that
initial
$33.00
shelter
allowance
is
being
included
for
the
two
afdc
recipients.
and
another
initial
$33.00
shelter
allowance
be
included
for
the
one
aptd
recipient
and
of
course
the
fourth
person
be
disregard.
so,
their
result
would
be
a
$66.00
shelter
allowance
for
this
household
of
three
recipients
as
suppose
to
the
$44.00
which
the
state
would
budget
and
puts
figure
they
don't
challenge
in
this
litigation
had
all
four
persons
it's
been
eligible
and
50%
increase
over
that
amount
and
of
course
twice
what
the
state
maintains
the
proper
amount
would
be
for
three
individuals
$33.00.
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
state's
proration
policy
violated
the
1976
federal
regulations
because
proration
was
a
presumption
that
income
was
available
to
the
eligible
recipients.
that's
incorrect
on
several
basis
need
as
defined
in
the
social
security
act
and
by
the
state
is
not
actual
shelter
cost
in
any
given
case.
the
fifth
circuit
also
ignored
the
fact
that
there
was
no
change
in
the
shelter
allowance
for
any
given
recipient;
it
remain
in
this
case
at
$11.00.
it
assumed
that
the
state
must
provide
shelter
for
ineligibles;
i've
already
mentioned
i
believe
that
that's
an
assumption
which
this
court
has
never
indulged
in
consciously
and
which
certainly
urge
not
today.
of
course
not
even
the
respondents
alleged
that
the
state
has
to
assume
the
burden
for
providing
for
the
needs
of
the
personal
needs
of
a
none
recipient
if
he
lives
with
recipients.
they
don't
assume
--
they
don't
assert
that
the
state
has
to
provide
medicate
benefits
for
the
none
recipient
and
so
we
urge
for
the
sake
of
consistency
of
nothing
else
that
the
state
not
be
obligated
to
provide
for
the
shelter
and
utilities
of
that
person
because
they
happen
to
live
with
the
recipient.
we
certainly
wouldn't
have
to
if
they
did
not
live
with
the
recipient.
the
fifth
circuit
also
of
course
relies
on
this
court's
decision
in
van
lare.
we
maintain
there
are
several
distinctions
between
our
case
and
van
lare
and
several
things
that
need
to
be
said
about
van
lare.
one,
the
new
york
policies
do
mentioned
the
income
and
we
say
did
treat
the
situation
in
new
york
as
an
income
question
as
impose
to
a
needs
questions.
they
used
the
word
in
their
policies
and
has
to
mean
something.
van
lare
is
remarkable
and
that
it
criticizes
a
states
for
not
prohibiting
loggers
for
being
in
welfare
homes.
i
say
that's
remarkable
because
that
was
a
case
where
the
two
of
the
constitutional
claims
alleged
were
privacy
and
freedom
of
association.
van
lare
also
criticizes
a
state
for
taking
no
further
action
and
that
is
into
allegedly
reduce.
i
would
say
not
reduce
but
allegedly
reduce
the
amount
for
shelter.
the
only
thing
else
the
state
could
do
is
cut
off
the
grant
entirely
and
that
would
run
into
king
against
smith
and
any
number
of
your
prior
decisions.
the
court
said
that
the
only
victim
is
the
needy
child
but
i
would
attempt
to
demonstrate
that
the
amount
of
shelter
need
budget
for
the
needy
child
is
not
affected
by
a
proration.
not
even
the
fifth
circuit
completely
ignore
the
implications
of
its
holding
because
it
did
say
that
when
the
none
recipient
owns
the
home
that
the
proration
is
permissible.
how
that,
is
not
an
assumption
of
income
but
the
other
is
has
not
explained.
that's
a
distinction,
it's
not
recognized
in
the
1977
hew
regulations
upon
which
the
solicitor
general
relies
and
upon
which
respondents
rely.
but
the
fifth
circuit's
distinction
is
not
challenged
here
because
there's
no
petition
for
certiorari
from
respondents.
not
incidentally,
hew
prior
to
this
time
had
not
found
any
fault
the
proration
in
the
record
at
245
in
the
appendix
at
40,
there's
instructions
from
the
dallas
regional
office
to
texas
to
include
prorated
figures
in
the
consolidated
amounts
and
that
even
says
in
the
record
at
253
how
hew
instructed
the
states
to
include
its
mistakes
as
well
as
the
correct
amounts
and
not
attempt
to
determine
which
was
which
because
the
object
of
the
fair
pricing
in
consolidation
was
to
come
up
with
the
average
amounts
that
the
state
actually
paid.
another
way
of
saying
all
these
is
my
last
argument
and
that's
the
state
discretion
argument
601,
42
u.s.c.
601
clearly
allows
the
states
to
set
their
standard
of
need
based
on
the
conditions
of
each
state
provide
assistance
as
far
as
practicable.
that's
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
i've
said
from
king
against
smith
to
as
recently
as
quern
against
mandley
right
at
the
end
of
last
term.
we
think
that
states
have
legitimate
interest
in
this
area
such
as
a
head
in
your
decision
in
wyman
against
james
and
dublino
against
new
york,
department
of
social
services
and
the
goal
in
this
case
is
not
to
provide
for
shelter
and
utilities
for
people
that
are
ineligible.
we
don't
do
where
they
--
where
ever
they
live
whether
it
was
a
recipient
or
not.
the
bottom
line
in
the
case
of
course
is,
is
that
there's
not
enough
money
in
texas
to
provide
for
the
actual
needs
of
these
individuals.
the
respondents
sought
to
attack
that
by
attacking
proration
but
to
increase
the
need
standard
in
texas
by
some
$9
millions
is
would
be
the
case
if
these
were
done
doesn't
increase
anything
except
the
number
of
ineligibles
getting
benefits.
it
doesn't
increase
the
state
appropriation
only
result
it
would
be
would
have
as
if
the
percentage
control
factor
which
is
now
75%
would
have
to
be
cut
further
and
the
money
that
would
go
to
the
nearly
created
ineligible
recipients
would
be
taken
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
people
that
are
admittedly
eligible.
thank
you.
mr.
david
h.
young
that's
correct
your
honor.
any
supremacy
clause
case
raising
actions
by
state
officials
--
mr.
david
h.
young
okay,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
back
to
the
ortega
households
for
just
one
second
that
please
remember
the
groupings
of
sizes
of
household
one
to
two
people
get
$33.00
for
shelter,
three
to
four
people
get
$44.00
for
shelter,
five
or
more
get
$50.00
for
shelter
that
$11.00
difference
between
the
$33.00
and
the
$44.00
for
the
ortega
household
is
a
result
to
that
grouping
of
the
shelter
allowances
between
the
various
sizes
of
household
it's
not
a
result
of
proration.
with
regard
to
the
new
hew
regulations
that
purport
to
codify
this
court's
decision
in
van
lare.
of
course
those
were
not
available
or
considered
at
all
by
the
district
court.
they
were
promulgated
prior
to
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
and
the
fifth
circuit
had
them
available
at
the
time
of
its
decision
but
it
did
not
based
its
decision
on
them
and
did
not
cite
them
or
make
any
reference
to
them.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
state's
practice
in
this
regard
is
of
long
standing,
it's
not
something
that
post
dates
van
lare
are
those
regulations.
it's
not
--
wasn't
created
in
perpetuity
wherever
it
comes
from
it's
been
around
a
long,
long
time.
it
wasn't
created
with
regard
to
van
lare
of
those
regulations
at
all
and
that
under
this
court's
recent
decision
in
quern
against
mandley
the
correct
test
to
see
by
what
standard
a
state's
provision
such
as
it
should
be
tested
is
the
standard
that
the
state
says
it
meets.
of
course
in
quern
against
mandley
it
was
a
switch
from
emergency
assistance
to
special
needs
in
afdc
but
you
said
the
test
was,
well,
they
characterized
the
special
needs,
doesn't
meet
those
standards.
we
characterized
it
and
did
long
before
van
lare
is
in
needs
standard
and
i
suggest
the
proper
question
is
whether
it
meets
the
needs
criteria.
the
only
limit
that
i
noted
in
the
respondent's
brief
as
to
jurisdiction
is
put
in
footnote
23
where
they
say
that
they
recognized
limits
on
jurisdiction
when
congress
specifically
acts
to
prohibit
jurisdiction.
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
a
backwards
argument
the
federal
district
courts
unlike
the
state
district
courts
in
texas
are
not
courts
of
general
jurisdiction.
the
district
--
federal
district
courts
are
only
suppose
to
have
jurisdiction
where
the
congress
grants
jurisdiction
to
them.
and
it's
--
the
only
broad
grant
i
was
ever
aware
of
that
was
sometimes
utilize
to
take
jurisdiction
in
wide
variety
of
cases
was
section
10.
i
believe
it
was
at
the
federal
administrative
procedures
act.
that
was
frequently
interpreted
where
the
issue
was
addressed
that
to
authorize
this
kind
of
a
test
in
this
court
in
colafado
against
sanders
said,
no,
that's
not
what
--
that
there
is
no
such
independent
basis
for
jurisdiction.
that
was
in
part
based
on
a
statute
that
congress
had
passed
just
prior
to
your
decision
that
remove
the
$10,000.00
limit
for
jurisdiction
against
federal
officials.
congress
is
considering
such
legislation
at
this
time
with
regard
to
the
states
and
it's
my
understanding
that
the
house
has
passed
hr9622
which
would
remove
it
as
to
states.
of
course
that
action
of
the
house
would
be
a
nullity
under
the
respondent's
theory.
with
regard
to
their
reply
brief,
the
real
legislative
history
is
what
the
congress
said.
it's
not
the
memo
dredged
up
somewhere
from
within
the
justice
department
and
in
that
respect
it's
interesting
to
know
that
when
the
solicitor
general
filed
his
amicus
brief
in
this
case
he
said
there
was
no
independent
federal
interest
in
the
resolution
of
the
jurisdictional
question.
i
find
that
in
every
remarkable
statement
considering
when
spend
a
good
deal
with
the
morning
talking
about
the
constitution
laws
in
1983
that
regardless
if
it
were
the
solicitor
general's
opinion
that
these
provisions
referred
to
all
laws
surely
he
would
taken
the
opportunity
in
his
amicus
brief
to
tell
us
some.
thank
you.
mr.
david
h.
young
the
jump
was
from
rosado
to
hagans
and
hagans
noted
the
question.
this
case
squarely
presents
the
question
what
do
you
do
when
you
did
not
have
as
you
had
in
hagans
the
fourteenth
amendment
claim
under
equal
protection.
it
was
quite
simple
to
resolve
hagans
of
what
was
pleaded
there
but
i
think
that
this
case
presents
the
issue
for
square
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
resolution
which
we
seek
is
appropriate
because
1983
speaks
about
constitution
and
laws.
hagans
basically
said,
we
have
the
constitution
so
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
and
laws
problem.
but
i
suggest
that
today
you
do
have
to
worry
about
it
because
you
don't
have
that
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
and
i
submit
that
the
plain
wording
of
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history
indicate
a
congressional
concern
for
the
vindication
of
federal
rights
under
federal
statutes
and
accordingly
on
the
first
prang
the
and
laws
embraces
all
federal
statutes
and
on
the
second
prang
1983
is
itself
an
act
providing
for
the
protection
of
equal
rights
under
1343(3)
and
an
act
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
--
mr.
david
h.
young
i
think
that
the
analysis
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
gas
and
i
think
the
analysis
from
mr.
justice
ferguson
in
price
and
the
analysis
by
mr.
justice
stone
in
hague
versus
cio
where
they're
interpreting
very
similar
language
in
the
criminal
conspiracy
statutes
that
is
secured
by
the
constitution
and
they
say
we
find
though
circular
for
the
position
that
the
word
secured
by
mean
created
by
rather
secured
by
can
embrace
both
created
by,
warranted
by,
finding
its
manifest
in,
embrace
etcetera
and
i
submit
that
under
that
type
of
analysis
it
unduly
restricts
the
statute
to
resist
and
to
limit
it
only
to
create.
mr.
david
h.
young
exactly
and
that's
precisely
what
congress
was
attempting
to
do
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
giving
to
multuity
of
the
historical
age.
mr.
david
h.
young
yes,
i
do
because
of
the
authorized
by
law
section
of
1343(3)
as
counsel
in
the
previous
case
stated
and
i
associate
myself
with
his
position.
we
would
be
unable
to
directly
connect
--
mr.
david
h.
young
the
supremacy
clause
to
why
there's
1343(3).
i
have
nothing
further.
thank
you.
