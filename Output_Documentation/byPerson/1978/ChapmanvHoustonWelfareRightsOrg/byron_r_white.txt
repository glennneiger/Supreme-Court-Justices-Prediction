justice
byron
r.
white
what
practical
difference
in
that
change?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
would
oppose
any
remand
for
purpose
of
amending
the
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
feel
then
that
the
--
if
we
should
reach
the
merits
of
the
van
lare
case
is
not
controlling?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
is
in
any
supremacy
clause
case
is
a
1983
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
regardless
of
what
the
underlying
rate
is
involved
or
what
underlying
claim
is
involve?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
say
in
your
position
that
surely
if
you
had
a
$10,000.00
in
controversy
you
could
bring
your
action
under
1331?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
unless
--
there
is
a
supremacy
clause
problem
involved
in
anyway
unless
the
state
is
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
usually
i
mean
that's
recurring
instance
where
the
supremacy
clause
is
invoked
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
where
there's
been
and
assertion
are
on
under
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
saying
that
even
though
congress
seem
to
say
in
1343(3)
that
only
certain
kinds
of
statutory
claims
would
be
vindicated
soon
as
supremacy
clause
you
can
read
each
other
statutory
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
does
limit
that
the
kinds
of
statutory
claims
it
would
reach?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
through
the
supremacy
clause
you
would
say
you
can
reach
any
statutory
claim
as
long
as
there
was
a
color
of
state
law
in
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh!
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
facts
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
1343(3)
dependently
gives
jurisdiction
where
the
claim
is
constitutional,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
it
also
--
but
it
gives
jurisdiction
over
constitutional
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
or
the
kind
in
1983
contemplates?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
case
did
involve
more
than
$10,000.00
exclusive
of
interest
and
cost,
it
seems
to
be
consider
as
i
understand
that
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction
under
1331?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
would
that
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
some
cases
that
saying
the
laws
provision
covers
any
kind
of
statutory
or
federal
statutory
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
never
mind
i
know
when
you
take
you
time
but
i
just
didn't
know
that
it
has
been
squarely
decided
here
that
maybe
has
that
the
and
laws
provision
of
1983
refers
to
any
federal
statutory
claim
whatsoever?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
the
second
circuit
protection
supremacy
clause
--
justice
byron
r.
white
respondents
having
said
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
if
your
view
of
1983
the
and
laws
provision
is
right
it
must
covered
by
1983
cover
a
lot
of
laws
other
than
civil
rights
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wasn't
asking
about
a
supremacy
clause,
i
was
asking
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
1334(4),
it
says
civil
rights
refers
to
civil
rights
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know.
i
think
there's
enough
a
lot
of
federal
statutes
that
somebody
maybe
--
that
aren't
civil
rights
laws
that
could
be
covered
by
1983
then
it
wouldn't
be
civil
rights
statutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
case
1871
statute
have
the
words
and
laws
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
right
under
the
federal
statute
enforcing
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
your
view,
you
don't
need
it
in
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
your
view,
you
don't
need
it
in
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
don't
you
read
it
is
being
redundant?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you're
right
about
the
one
and
laws
word
are
redundant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
congress
never
needed
that
before
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
congress
never
--
it
was
unnecessary
for
congress
to
had
in
section
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
accept
your
interpretation
of
3
then
you
can
accept
your
interpretation
of
4
either
in
the
sense
that
civil
rights
isn't
just
an
automatic
reference
to
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
1343(4)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
quite
understand
that
if
and
laws
and
1983
covers
all
statutes
--
covers
all
federal
statutes,
do
you
need
to
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
1983
reaches
all
claims
under
any
federal
statute
that
might
be
fairly
said
to
enforce
some
constitutional
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
say
you
have
to
be
enforcing
the
civil
war
amendments?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
need
four,
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
you
--
to
have
a
cause
of
action
to
have
jurisdiction
under
1343(4),
do
you
agree
that
you
must
refer
in
the
first
place
to
1983?
is
that
the
statute
which
satisfies
the
authorized
the
law
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
do
you
think
in
any
action
under
1343(4)
must
involve
state
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
require
1983
it
does,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
brings
him
--
is
it
correct
description
the
holding
in
rosado?
there
was
a
constitutional
claim
in
rosado.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
think
that
will
makes
any
difference
on
this
point
i
gather
from
what
you've
said
that
you
still
have
to
inquire
about
the
cause
of
action,
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
question
is
cause
of
action
--
justice
byron
r.
white
hagans
and
lavine
left
that
very
question
open
but
rosado
didn't
apparently
know
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
hagans
and
edelman?
