mr.
stephen
skillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
might
be
useful
that
the
outset
to
note
the
specific
allegations
of
the
complaint
which
bring
these
jurisdictional
issues
before
the
court
today.
i
note
them
not
because
their
important
to
the
disposition
of
the
jurisdictional
issue
are
such
but
because
they
maybe
useful
just
by
way
of
illustration.
in
brief,
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
petitioner
was
mugged
after
cashing
her
monthly
welfare
and
social
security
checks
and
that
as
a
result
she
was
unable
to
pay
her
rent
or
her
gas
and
electric
bill.
the
complaint
further
alleged
than
rather
general
terms
that
as
a
result
of
the
inability
to
pay
either
of
these
bills
that
the
plaintiff
was
within
approximation
of
dispositions
since
she
can't
pay
her
rent
and
imminent
danger
of
having
her
gas
and
electricity
terminated.
it
was
further
alleged
that
despite
the
solicitor
grant
the
family
emergency
assistance.
upon
this
position
having
been
taken
by
the
local
welfare
official
complaint
was
filed
directly
in
federal
district
court
based
on
these
allegations
which
claim
first
that
the
denial
violated
the
provision
of
federal
law
same
provisions
recently
interpreted
by
this
court
last
june
in
quern
v.
mandley.
and
secondly,
that
this
action
violated
the
new
jersey
regulations
governing
an
emergency
assistance.
the
critical
part
of
those
state
regulations
provide
that
when
an
actual
state
of
homelessness
exist
or
is
manifestly
imminent,
the
county
welfare
board
shall
authorize
payment
of
the
actual
cost
of
adequate
emergency
care.
i'm
not
with
certainty
at
least
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
that
this
case
fail
satisfy
the
governing
state
regulations
and
despite
the
circumstance,
a
complaint
was
filed
directly
in
federal
district
court.
and
today,
we're
confronted
with
the
rather
difficult
questions
concerning
the
reach
of
the
jurisdictional
sections
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act
in
this
prospect.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
would
say
they
have
been
conclusively
adjudicated
adversely
to
the
petitioners
your
honor
yes.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
would
say
so.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
--
yes,
there
was
that
pending
state
claim
which
is
really
receiving
of
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
and
i
think
that
claim
is
also
fabulous
at
this
point
knowing
the
face
of
the
complaint
but
in
light
of
the
affidavit
is
they
were
filing
a
motion
for
some
rejudgment.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
at
this
juncture
that
there's
no
substantial
pending
claim
other.
section
1343(3)
is
the
primary
jurisdictional
section
that's
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner
as
conferring
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
district
court
over
this
action.
this
section
has
two
quite
separate
basis
of
jurisdiction.
first,
is
the
deprivation
of
any
right
privilege
or
immunity
secured
by
the
constitution
and
the
second
is
the
deprivation
of
any
right
privilege
or
immunity
secured
by
any
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights
of
citizens.
the
petitioner
in
two
disjunctive
arguments
relies
upon
both
of
these
subprovisions
of
1343(3).
the
constitutional
supremacy
clause
argument
relying
upon
the
deprivation
of
any
right
privilege
immunity
secured
by
the
constitution
is
an
effect
in
argument
that
every
time
congress
enacts
a
new
statute
it
creates
a
new
right
privilege
or
immunity
secure
against
deprivation
by
state
action
through
the
supremacy
clause.
however,
as
the
third
circuit
properly
noted
in
its
opinion
when
congress
enacts
a
statute
creating
rights,
it
is
that
statute
and
not
the
supremacy
clause
that
confers
any
rights
or
privileges
or
immunities
that
the
individual
may
claim.
now,
the
supremacy
clause
become
relevant
if
the
state
through
its
legislative
of
actions
seeks
to
take
action
that
will
work
the
operation
of
that
federal
legislation
that
is
inconsistent
without
federal
legislation.
yet,
it
remains
the
federal
legislation
that
confers
the
right
that
maybe
claimed
by
the
particular
individual.
so,
on
its
face,
they
secured
by
the
constitution
language
just
as
is
not
applied.
furthermore,
if
the
constitutional
portion
of
1343(3)
were
read
as
broadly
as
it's
urged
by
the
petitioner
there
will
be
absolutely
no
need
for
the
statutory
part
of
the
section.
district
court
jurisdiction
would
extend
to
every
state
action
case
based
on
any
federal
statute
and
there
will
be
no
need
for
congress
and
3443(3)
to
have
go
in
ahead
and
also
confer
jurisdiction
based
upon
a
more
limited
class
of
federal
statutes
providing
for
equal
rights
of
citizens.
in
other
words,
the
second
part
of
1343(3)
would
be
surplusage,
it
would
redundancy
if
the
petitioner's
supremacy
clause
argument
were
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
1343(4)
presents
somewhat
different
questions
that
i
would
like
if
i
may
your
honor
to
address
later
on.
i
think
it's
appropriate
then
to
turn
to
the
second
part
of
1343(3)
and
i
think
that
this
also
really
gets
to
the
1343(4)
argument
as
well.
the
critical
language
of
1343(3)
is
that
there
must
be
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights.
now,
we
think
it's
clear
that
neither
the
language
of
this
provision
providing
for
equal
rights
its
historical
origins
in
1871
nor
its
relationship
to
other
jurisdictional
sections
including
1331
supports
its
use
in
a
case
claiming
solely
a
violation
of
the
federal
social
security
act.
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
your
honor
we
think
that
1983
provides
a
cause
of
action
where
you
can
find
some
other
legislation
that
provides
the
substantive
cause
of
action.
but
that
it
does
not
fit
with
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
not
by
itself.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
i
think
that
certainly
critical
part
of
our
argument
whether
its
acceptance
is
a
precondition
to
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
it's
only
critical
of
our
argument..
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
what
the
court
has
done
without
articulate
in
those
cases
is
to
imply
from
the
social
security
act
itself.
a
cause
of
action
in
federal
district
court
for
at
least
a
declaratory
judgment
which
was
what
was
issued
in
those
cases.
there's
no
discussion
of
that
in
the
cases
and
i
think
it's
assumed
that
the
pendant
claim
was
one
over
which
there
was
a
cause
of
action
that
could
be
pursued
in
federal
court.
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
i
think
that
there's
certainly
at
this
point
pretty
long
line
of
cases
which
in
the
pendant
jurisdiction
context
have
at
least
issued
declaratory
judgments
and
i
have
recognized
a
cause
of
action
for
declaratory
judgment
whether
or
not
damages
for
example
would
be
appropriate
in
that
same
context
as
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
is
a
different
question
and
i
don't
know
that
that's
have
been
addressed.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
believe
that
not
only
declaratory
relief
but
also
injunctive
relief.
i
believe
has
been
granted.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
no
but
we
very
strongly
argue
against
that
proposition
and
we
think
that
and
laws
and
1983
must
be
read
in
light
of
its
companion
jurisdictional
statute
1343(3)
and
not
extend
to
every
statute
that's
been
enacted
by
congress.
mr.
stephen
skillman
based
on
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
substantive
rights
found
else
where.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that's
correct
that's
i
said
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
and
i
hope
it's
a
critical
part
of
our
argument
but
not
necessarily
a
precondition
to
deciding
in
this
respect.
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that
it
simply
that
spent
some
amount
of
time
on
the
question
whether
or
not
the
pendant
statutory
claim
could
survive
once
the
constitutional
issue
had
been
mooted
by
the
changes
in
new
york's
practices
but
i
don't
know
that
ever
articulated
where
the
cause
of
action
came
from.
if
it
did
your
honor,
i
missed
it
on
reading
the
case
and
i
don't
believe
that
it
has.
i
think
that
the
critical
way
out
of
what's
been
declined,
what's
been
described
in
this
case
as
a
circularity
whether
you
start
with
1343(3)
and
read
the
and
laws
provision
of
1983
in
terms
of
the
providing
for
equal
rights
provision
of
1343(3)
or
whether
your
start
the
other
way
and
read
and
laws
as
in
some
way
expanding
the
language
of
1343(3)
is
to
look
to
the
historical
basis
of
the
statute
as
first
enacted
in
1871.
at
that
time,
the
focus
--
the
intention
was
certainly
to
provide
a
mechanism
for
the
enforcement
of
the
thirteenth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
both
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
had
conferred
power
upon
congress
to
enact
legislation
that
would
implement
those
rights
created
by
and
recognized
by
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
and
i
think
that
the
common
assumption
in
1871
was
that
there
was
to
be
considerable
congressional
activity
in
implementation
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
and
that
through
the
reconstruction
period
did
not
come
to
pass,
there
was
not
the
amount
of
legislation,
there
would've
been
expected
in
1871
but
if
the
question
is
why
add
the
word
and
laws
and
what
was
meant
by
the
term
and
laws
in
1983?
it
was
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
would
be
implemented
through
significant
congressional
legislation
and
we
submit
that
1983
should
be
read
in
light
of
this
historical
context
in
which
it
was
enacted
and
that
as
well
as
in
light
of
the
providing
for
equal
rights
language
of
1343(3)
which
both
we
and
the
petitioners
agree
were
complementary
provisions
in
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
i
think
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
i
think
more
doubtful
but
probably
also
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
there
maybe
on
certainties
about
the
fifteenth
amendment
may
have
been
the
reason
for
four.
i
know
that
four
at
the
end
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
inclusive
--
puts
the
phrase
including
the
right
to
vote.
so,
that
maybe
a
possible
explanation
for
why
4
was
added
but
on
4
is
bit
of
a
mystery.
i
think
that
when
that
legislation
was
originally
drafted
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
if
your
question
is,
is
there
any
other
statute
besides
1983
which
also
might
serve
that
function,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
of
any
but
i
can't
say
categorically
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
that's
--
that's
a
good
question.
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes.
but
if
it
were
possible
to
imply
cause
of
action
from
some
other
federal
civil
rights
statute
that
was
not
dependent
on
state
action
then
there
would
be
some
room
for
1343(4)
operate.
i'm
speaking
the
abstract,
i
cannot
identify
the
statute.
i
do
think
though
that
in
the
legislative
of
history
the
57th
civil
rights
act
that
there
were
initially
substantive
provisions
that
were
drafted
that
did
not
make
their
way
into
the
final
bill.
so,
that
i
think
that
1343(4)
may
have
been
intended
to
clearly
establish
jurisdiction
to
eliminate
any
possible
question
as
to
1343(3)
applying
to
new
substantive
provision
that
didn't
find
their
way
into
the
eventual
legislation.
it's
a
very
shrouded
kind
of
legislative
of
history.
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
point
if
i
may.
the
argument
is
made
and
it's
made
primarily
by
the
respondents
in
the
texas
case
argued
previously
that
providing
for
equal
rights
language
of
1343(3)
should
be
given
a
very
expands
of
reading
because
this
is
desirable
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
somehow
federal
courts
are
better
able
to
deal
with
federal
questions
than
state
courts.
and
the
suggestion
is
that
in
practical
effect,
this
kind
of
an
expands
of
reading
of
1343(3)
would
have
the
same
effect
as
deleting
the
jurisdictional
amount
requirement
of
1331
with
respect
to
cases
and
which
the
state
is
the
defendant.
i
think
that
there
are
significant
differences
though
between
proposals
that
have
been
before
congress
to
delete
the
jurisdictional
amount
requirement
of
1331
and
what
would
be
the
practical
effect
of
accepting
the
petitioner's
arguments
as
the
1343(3).
first,
there
is
the
point
that
we've
discussed
previously
that
the
1331
leaves
open
the
question
of
implying
that
a
cause
of
action
from
some
other
federal
statute.
and
in
implying
the
cause
of
action
from
some
other
federal
statutes
such
as
the
social
security
act
it's
possible
to
imply
a
right
to
secure
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief
and
at
the
same
time
not
to
imply
a
cause
of
action
from
money
damages
such
as
would
be
recognized
under
1343(3)
and
1983.
secondly,
the
law
under
1983
has
evolved
such
that
there
is
a
very
limited
room
if
any
for
the
operation
of
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
this
court
noted
in
gibson
v.
berryhill
that
that
issue
was
not
one
that's
closed
that
there
may
still
be
some
circumstances
under
which
exhaustion
that
administrative
of
remedies
maybe
required
in
1983
actions.
but
at
the
present
time
and
as
dealt
with
the
lease
by
many
of
the
lower
federal
courts
that
doctrine
is
practically
none
existent
in
an
1983
case.
what
that
would
mean
is
a
practical
matters
that
if
you
accept
the
petitioner's
argument
--
any
welfare
case
in
which
the
cause
of
action
is
pleaded
as
having
been
--
is
being
predicated
on
federal
law
could
be
brought
in
federal
district
court
even
if
ultimately
it
turns
out
that
the
issues
are
essentially
factual
and
that
they
are
capable
of
resolution
in
terms
solely
of
state
law.
and
i
take
this
case
at
least
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
as
an
example.
it
may
have
turned
out
at
some
later
stage
that
significant
issues
as
to
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law
quern
v.
mandley
emerged.
but
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
and
on
the
face
of
the
jersey
regulations,
this
might
have
been
a
case
where
the
$163.00
in
welfare
benefits
which
was
what
was
an
issue
could've
been
resolved
very
easily
within
the
state
welfare
administrative
mechanism.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
the
possible
existence
of
a
class
is
something
that
i
think
only
emerged
at
some
point
beyond
the
face
of
the
complaint
your
honor.
but
it
would
be
a
possibility
for
at
least
a
subportion
of
that
class,
i
think
it's
what
i'm
saying.
there
ultimately
it
may
have
turned
out
that
there
were
some
and
in
fact
we
now
know
that
there
were
some
petitioners
who
would
not
qualify
for
benefits
under
the
jersey
regulation
that
might
have
qualified
for
benefits
under
the
federal
statute
if
this
court's
decision
in
quern
v.
mandley
had
come
out
the
other
way.
but
as
to
this
particular
petitioner
and
some
other
part
of
the
subclass
then
they
may
have
been
able
to
receive
their
emergency
assistance
benefits
quickly
and
without
regard
to
the
ultimate
resolution
of
that
conflict
issue
in
quern
v.
mandley.
and
my
point
is
that
this
overly
expands
of
reading
of
1983
and
3143(3)
urged
by
the
petitioners
with
its
concomitant
generally
prevailing
rule
of
no
requirement
of
exhaustion
of
administrator
remedies
would
preclude
resort
to
the
simpler
and
easier
means
of
disposing
of
many
such
controversies.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i'm
not
sure
i
picked
up
the
full
quote
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
don't
know
the
exact
context
and
which
that
sentence
appears
but
on
its
face,
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that.
mr.
stephen
skillman
at
least
that
the
statement
and
i
don't
know
if
that
statement
was
(voice
overlap)
to
the
whole
decision
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
there
was
a
constitutional
claim
in
rosado
and
there
was
a
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
you
still
have
to
find
a
cause
of
action
even
though
the
--
even
on
dependent
claim,
you
still
have
to
find
a
cause
of
action,
but
i
think
that
that
was
found
in
the
social
security
act
itself
in
rosado.
mr.
stephen
skillman
as
to
jurisdiction
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
stephen
skillman
as
to
the
cause
of
action
there
might
still
be
a
question
about.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
it
didn't
address
(voice
overlap)
but
it
silently
grant
the
relief.
mr.
stephen
skillman
correct
exactly.
mr.
stephen
skillman
and
i
would
suggest
to
that
it
found
the
cause
of
action
for
at
least
for
declaratory
injunctive
relief
in
the
social
security
act
itself
and
it
certainly
become
common
in
the
last
decade
result
to
imply
causes
of
action
from
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
hagans
and
gi
case
versus
borack
and
i
can
go
and
i
am
sure
with
the
considerably
law
that
was
not.
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
hagans
is
later
but
i
won't
want
to
say
that
with
total
assurance
--
their
close
in
time.
thank
you.
