justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
have
you
just
abandon
your
suggestion
a
moment
ago
that
there
has
to
be
a
clear
conflict
between
the
state
rule
and
the
federal
rule?
what
if
they
are
precisely
the
same?
pardon
me.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
then,
couldn't
in
ever
case
couldn't
pursue
in
the
first
instance
to
the
federal
court
saying
you
don't
think
you'd
win
in
the
state
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
you
say
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
you're
entitled
to
some
kind
of
a
benefit
if
your
client
is
incapacitated
and
the
state
has
found
him
not
to
be
incapacitated
but
they're
wrong
as
a
matte
of
federal
law
why
aren't
you
still
entitle
to
go
in
a
1983?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
say,
we
apply
the
same
rule
as
a
federal?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
monroe
against
pape,
state
of
illinois
or
city
of
chicago
said
they
announced
exactly
the
same
rule
as
the
federal
constitution
required
and
yet
the
court
here
how
could
you
go
right
into
the
federal
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
it's
due
to
the
constitutional
rule
on
the
state
rule,
is
it?
or
do
you
say
the
test
is
different
when
it's
a
federal
statutory
claim
in
the
federal
constitution
claim?
i
just
don't
follow
you.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
it
didn't
in
monroe
against
pape
is
all
i'm
saying?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
they
didn't
have
a
chance
to
find
out
whether
they
would
or
not
because
they
said
you
can't
sue
unless
you
can
go
and
sue
in
the
federal
court
without
suing
the
state
court.
why
couldn't
you
do
that
with
a
welfare
claim
also?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
know
it
would
repetitiuos.
once
again,
tell
me
once
more,
why
is
that
different
fro
monroe
against
pape?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there's
no
question
of
conflict
in
monroe
against
pape?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
don't
argue
the
rule
against
policeman
beating
up
you
know
people
when
they
search
them
at
all.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
skarda,
in
that
point
you
mentioned
the
two
statutes
have
a
coextensive
in
the
sense.
would
you
say
the
words
and
laws
in
1983
have
the
same
meaning
as
the
words
act
of
congress?
providing
for
equal
rights
of
citizens
etcetera
in
43(3)?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
then
under
the
and
laws
provision
it
has
be
laws
providing
for
equal
rights
and
effect
then
you
have
to
say
do
you
not
that
the
social
security
act
is
an
act
providing
for
the
equal
rights
of
citizens?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
unless
you
just
told
me
though
that
you
do
acquit
the
words
and
laws
in
1983
with
the
words
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights
in
1343(3)?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
they're
not
coextensive
are
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
then
going
back
to
my
first,
you
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
words
and
laws
in
1983
are
coextensive
with
the
words
act
of
congress
providing
of
equal
rights
in
43(3)?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
say
that
1983
provision
is
broader.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
must
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
order
to
get
within
1983
you
must
construe
the
word
laws
in
1983
to
be
broader
than
the
concept
of
laws
protecting
equal
rights.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
therefore,
you
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
two
statutes
are
coextensive?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
coextensive
to
the
extent
that
it
helps
you
but
to
the
extent
that
hurts?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
have
you
finished
your
answer
with
justice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
you're
correct
mr.
skarda
and
you
maybe
of
course
that
the
word
laws
in
1983
it
much
broader
than
the
or
is
somewhat
broader
than
the
concept
of
equal
rights.
does
it
cover
every
federal
statute
and
is
it
therefore
unnecessary
for
the
court
to
consider
whether
particular
statutes
like
the
securities
act
and
so
forth
imply
causes
of
action?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
it
would
apply
if
i
understand
your
concept
correctly
to
any
federal
right
given
to
an
individual
citizen
as
against
state
authority?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
you
would
never
have
to
us
we
did
for
example
in
the
bucky
case
last
year
consider
whether
or
not
there
was
an
implied
cause
of
action
under
title
6.
we'll
could
just
right
rely
on
1983
there
was
a
federal
statute
and
so
forth.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
your
fundamental
difference
is
the
jurisdictional
amount
applies
to
suits
between
private
citizens
and
there's
no
reason
for
jurisdictional
amount
when
the
claim
is
by
the
individual
against
the
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
through
mr.
gardner
with
your
discussion
to
1343(3)?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
whether
you
take
the
position
that
the
words
and
laws
in
1983
are
broader
or
coextensive
than
the
words
by
any
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights
in
1343(3)?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
there
is
a
gap
between
the
two
state?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
mean,
there's
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
because
you
say
that
part
of
the
function
of
1983
is
to
provide
for
equal
rights
of
citizens
and
it
has
additional
functions
and
those
additional
functions
maybe
this
jurisdiction
to
perform
those
additional
functions
conferred
by
subparagraph
3,
that's
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
you
would
say
that
whenever
you
have
the
claim
against
the
state
agency
or
person
acting
under
color
of
state
law
in
which
you
assert
to
federal
basis
for
your
claim,
you
never
need
to
enquire
into
other
congress
intended
to
apply
a
private
cause
of
action
because
1983
will
always
provide
the
vehicle
for
the
cause
of
action?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
subparagraph
4
surplusage
in
your
theory,
you
never
need
subparagraph
4?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
skillman,
right
on
that
point,
there
were
some
cases
if
i
recall
correctly
in
which
jurisdiction
was
predicated
on
a
constitutional
claim
and
then
pendant
to
the
constitutional
claim
and
attack
was
made
on
a
state
welfare
program
or
one
kind
or
another.
and
jurisdiction
was
sustained
on
the
pendant
jurisdiction
there
is
they
didn't
even
need
1343(3).
can
you
tell
me
what
the
statutory
basis
for
the
federal
cause
of
action
those
cases
was,
was
it
not
1983?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
the
court
has
to
disavow
those
cases
to
sustain
your
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
concede
there
is
some
kind
of
a
federal
cause
of
action
here
if
not
under
1983
at
least
it's
implied
under
the
social
security
act?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
if
your
relief
is
being
granted
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
injunctive
relief
has
been
given
in
some
of
those
case
i
believe.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
but
you
say
that
the
federal
basis
for
the
cause
of
action
those
cases
should
not
properly
be
consider
in
1983
but
should
be
considered
in
implied
cause
of
action
predicated
in
the
underlying
statute
even
though
the
court
never
discussed
it
or
analyze
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
excuse
me,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
your
position.
do
you
say
the
words
and
laws
in
1983
are
the
same
limitation
as
the
words
in
1343(3)?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
you
say
then
i
understand
you.
if
you
say
that
you
really
don't
have
to
say
that
1983
is
only
an
authorization
because
of
action,
you
really
have
two
alternative
arguments.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
skillman,
before
you
sit
down.
in
edelman
against
jordan
in
page
675,
the
court
said,
it
is
a
course
through
that
rosado
against
wyman
397
u.s.
397
held
that
suits
in
federal
court
under
section
1983
are
proper
to
secure
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
on
the
part
of
the
participating
states.
now,
if
that
statement
is
correct,
does
that
not
knockout
one
half
of
your
double
--
you
had
two
answers
to
the
problem.
it
does
not
that
foreclose
the
argument
that
the
word
and
laws
is
no
broader
than
the
words
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
full
quote
is
that
it
is
of
course
through
that
rosado
against
wyman
held
that
suits
in
federal
court
under
section
1983
are
proper
to
secure
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
on
the
part
of
the
participating
states.
now,
i
assume
that
social
security
acts
are
not
equal
right
statutes.
therefore,
if
the
statement
is
true
and
if
1983
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
a
welfare
claims
against
the
state,
necessarily
the
court
is
here
saying
that
the
words
and
laws
in
1983
are
broader
than
the
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
that
one
branch
of
your
argument
would
require
the
court
to
disavow
the
statement
in
effect?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
this
decision
that
or
unless
it
is
a
correct
description
of
the
holding
in
rosado
that
will
require.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
have
to
find
cause
of
action
some
place
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
theoretically
answered
his
argument
that
it's
an
act
which
provides
a
remedy
rather
than
creating
any
new
rights
and
therefore
it's
a
statute
which
secure
his
rights
within
the
meaning
of
the
jurisdictional
claim.
