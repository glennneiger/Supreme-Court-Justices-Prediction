rehnquist
mr.
young,
you
say
you
hope
to
speak
to
a
very
little
as
i
read
your
petition
or
your
brief
on
the
merits
is
the
first
question
raised
in
your
brief
on
a
merits
and
if
you'll
notice
the
case
set
for
argument
after
yours
as
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
which
that's
the
only
question
raised
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
will
you
be
by
a
clear
federal
conflict
presumably
clear
or
unclear
if
there's
a
claim
of
conflict
you'd
have
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
just
no
claims
just
arising
under
like
a
questions
about
construction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
you
have
and
as
applied
claim
in
other
words
even
though
the
state
and
federal
claims
were
statutorily
identical?
you
could
claim
that
as
applied
the
state
system
was
not
delivering
the
thing
the
way
the
federal
statute
required?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
not
a
practical
reason.
now,
that's
not
a
jurisdictional
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
hagans
agains
lavine
depended
on
the
assertion
of
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
and
then
statutory
claim
with
regard
its
pendent,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
wasn't
the
issue
we're
talking
about
now
reserved
in
hagans
against
lavine?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
that
1875
that
congress
enacted
for
the
first
time
general
federal
question
jurisdiction,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
have
been
kind
of
strange
for
them
to
put
a
$2,000.00
or
$3,000.00
jurisdictional
limitation
on
that
kind
of
jurisdiction
and
still
have
treated
as
broadly
as
you
say
they
do
1343?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
claim
that
the
social
security
act
is
an
act
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
so
that
1983
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
feel
that
you
don't
need
the
and
laws
language
would
you
have
real
to
have
with
swift
versus
wickham,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
rely
on
the
and
laws
provision
in
this
case
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
plead
the
supremacy
clause
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you're
right
about
to
see
your
supremacy
clause
claim,
what
do
you
need
and
laws
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
i
follow,
you
say
that
we're
dealing
only
with
the
federal
statute
but
you're
dealing
with
the
federal
statute
that's
claimed
to
override
or
preempt
the
state
statute,
aren't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
have
a
federal
statute
in
the
state
statute
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
have
a
supremacy
claim
you
can
always
bring
it
here
if
it's
turned
down
by
the
state
courts
then.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
there
really
isn't
any
alternative
if
in
some
areas
that
you
simply
can't
get
your
federal
question
adjudicated
unless
you're
allowed
to
have
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
burden
that
lots
of
litigants
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
one
thing
to
say
that
1983
embraces
civil
rights
act
as
you
put
in
the
sense
that
it
creates
a
cause
of
action
for
people
who
have
been
damaged
by
violation
of
some
substantive
right
created
else
where?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
to
get
back
to
your
treat
of
1983
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
1983
is
itself
a
law
protecting
civil
rights,
could
not
one
argue
that
it
is
simply
an
act
which
gives
you
a
cause
of
action
if
some
civil
right
created
else
where
has
been
infringed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
rosado
against
wyman
articulate
the
basis
for
jurisdiction
over
the
statutory
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
really
a
cause,
there
really
is
a
question,
is
there
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hagans
came
several
years
after
rosado?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
same
years.
