justice
potter
stewart
because
there
was
a
constitutional
claim
here
in
the
sense
that
there
was
a
supremacy
clause
claim,
wasn't
there?
that
we're
going
to
hear
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
certainly
whenever
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
whenever
the
complaint
is
based
upon
a
conflict
between
of
state's
statute
of
policy
in
a
federal
statute
and
claim
being
made
that
the
state
is
acting
inconsistently
with
the
federal
statute
that's
necessarily
as
supremacy
clause
claim,
isn't
it
which
is
a
constitutional
claim
at
least?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
excuse
me
mr.
young.
around
the
subject
looking
at
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
which
begins
on
page
b
30
of
your
petitioner
for
certiorari,
there's
an
initial
footnote
that
so
far
as
i
know
is
the
entire
discussion
by
the
court
of
this
jurisdictional
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
that
footnote,
the
court
says,
although,
other
circuits
disagree
we
have
held
that
section
1983
is
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
sufficient
to
invoke
section
1343(4)
jurisdiction.
is
there
in
fact
disagreement
on
that
general
proposition?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
whether
or
not
since
1983
is
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
efficient
to
invoke
1343(4)
jurisdiction,
is
there
any
disagreement
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
disagreement
was
whether
or
not
this
lawsuit
is
within
the
ambit
of
1343(4)
or
you
want
to
say
1343(3)
or
(4)?
justice
potter
stewart
not
whether
a
lawsuit
that
is
within
1343
is
there
is
jurisdiction
such
a
lawsuit
under
1983,
i
don't
think
there's
any
disagreement
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
other
words,
i
don't
follow
this
footnote
and
i
was
asking
you
if
you
could
help
me
explain
it.
justice
potter
stewart
because
we
don't
--
nobody
gets
to
the
merits
if
you're
right
on
your
jurisdictional
claim,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
skarda,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
position
for
me
a
very
difficult
case
because
it
involves
so
much
circularity
of
the
arguments
on
both
sides
to
this
jurisdictional
question.
let's
assume
there
were
no
section
1983,
just
assume
that
wasn't
at
books
at
all.
would
it
be
your
position
that
1343(28)
u.s.
code
1343
would
provide
jurisdiction
of
this
case
since
it
is
based
upon
the
conflict
between
federal
law
and
state
law
and
therefore
ultimately
upon
the
supremacy
clause?
1343
says,
the
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
authorized
by
law
of
if
he
commits
by
any
person
to
recover
damages
or
secure
equitable
or
other
relief
under
any
act
of
congress
--
excuse
me,
between
the
three,
--
of
any
right
privilege
or
immunity
secure
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
would
be
the
supremacy
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
you
need
1983
for
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
because
only
that
section
is
a
law
that
authorizes
this
cause
of
action?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
have
apparently
you
don't
think
that
the
supremacy
clause
case
has
to
involve
a
law
providing
for
equal
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
supremacy
clause
case
is
that
1343(3)
covers
and
include
many
none
equal
rights
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
need
the
phrase
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights
of
citizens
in
three
or
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
and
four,
in
order
generically
to
invoke
1983?
justice
potter
stewart
generically,
and
then
when
you
invoke
1983
you
see
exactly
what
it
says
and
it
says
something
beyond
what
is
genus
would
imply?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
if
you're
arguing
on
4
has
the
same
problem
with
it
because
you
then
have
to
say
and
laws
and
83'
is
broader
than
civil
rights
in
4
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you
get
the
same
--
justice
potter
stewart
requires
that
and
laws
be
a
broader
concept
on
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
has
any
court
ever
adopted
this
line
of
reasoning?
justice
potter
stewart
1983.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
sit
down,
do
the
court's
opinion
in
rachel
case
or
the
peacock
case
bare
on
this
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
they
deal
about
the
removal
statute
the
different
statute
under
relying
rational
wise.
justice
potter
stewart
the
merits
of
this
controversy
in
so
far
as
the
claim
is
a
conflict
between
the
state
and
federal
law
were
decided
adversely
to
the
complaint
in
quern
against
mandley,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
case,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
they
had
another
claim
of
course
that
this
violated
state
law
itself,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
which
of
course
not
(voice
overlap)
in
quern
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
quite
the
claim.
as
i
understand
it,
would
you
think
1983
falls
within
that
definition
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
in
itself
is
not
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
have
to
make
that
argument,
don't
you
you
have
to
take
that
position
and
successfully
assert
it
in
order
for
you
to
prevail,
don't
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
grant
of
the
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
it's
a
critical
part
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
first
of
all,
you
said
that
1983
is
not
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights
of
citizens
and
it's
not
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
that
it's
merely
an
act
of
congress
that
authorizes
a
cause
of
action
--
justice
potter
stewart
based
on
something
else.
justice
potter
stewart
if
1343(3)
as
everybody
agrees
no
more
than
a
jurisdictional
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
1983
is
no
more
than
authorizes
a
cause
of
action.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
cause
of
action
must
be
based
upon
something
else?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
therefore,
1983
does
not
fall
within
the
definition
of
1343(3)
or
(4)?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
they
were
originally
enacted
at
the
same
time.
justice
potter
stewart
in
you
they
respect
of
prevail?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
if
there's
a
substantial
let's
say
equal
protection
claim
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
then
clearly
under
hagans
against
lavine
and
other
cases
as
you
can
have
pendant
statutory
claim
--
justice
potter
stewart
right,
no,
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
you
have
to
be
right
on
this
don't
you
in
order
even
to
support
your
alternative
supremacy
clause
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
