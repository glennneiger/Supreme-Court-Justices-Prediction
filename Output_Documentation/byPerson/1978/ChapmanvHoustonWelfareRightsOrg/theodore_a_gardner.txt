mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
gonzalez
versus
young
we
set
in
tandem
argument
with
the
chapman
case
which
immediately
proceeded
it.
i
noted
the
court's
questions
and
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
them
directly.
mr.
justice
stevens
and
mr.
justice
white
seem
to
have
some
difficulty
with
an
extensive
interpretation
of
the
and
laws
provisions
in
1983.
i
submit
that
that
perception
is
contrary
to
what
congress
is
all
about
when
it
enacted
1983.
i
submit
further
that
that
perception
is
contrary
to
the
wording
of
the
statute.
let
me
go
back
for
a
minute
if
i
may.
in
the
period
1868
to
1871,
federal
government
was
faced
with
a
situation
where
several
state's
rights
groups
contended
that
not
with
standing
the
federal
constitution.
the
ultimate
legal
authority
to
determine
questions
of
federal
law
repose
in
the
states.
this
was
at
the
time
when
the
freidman's
bureau
act
was
not
being
enforced.
as
a
result
to
that
situation,
president
grant
went
before
the
congress
and
effectively
said,
the
laws
of
the
federal
government
are
not
being
enforced.
congress
has
to
act
pursuant
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
regard
to
that,
congress
enacted
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
which
is
the
precursor
of
1983
and
1343.
it
was
in
point
of
fact
congressional
concern
about
none
enforcement
of
federal
rights
by
the
direct
interposition
of
state
power
that
in
fact
was
the
focus
of
the
entire
juridical
mechanism
that
we
now
know
has
1983
and
1343.
viewed
in
that
light
there
is
not
one
reason
to
interpret
1983
in
a
restrictive
manner
in
truth
to
narrow
why
is
1983
the
basis
and
penalizes
the
entire
congressional
problem
that
was
addressed
in
1871.
we
must
keep
in
mind
here
that
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
interpose
each
judicial
power
between
private
parties
nor
between
situations
involving
simply
federal
law
and
none
$10,000.00
questions.
but
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
federalistic
and
taginism
between
states
and
the
federal
government.
let's
for
a
minute
just
dwell
on
the
facts
of
both
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
the
1871
statute
only
used
the
word
constitution.
it
was
not
until
the
amendment
in
1874
that
the
and
laws
was
included.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
significant
for
the
following
reasons.
number
one,
in
1871,
congress
could
only
act
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
accordingly,
when
congress
spoke
in
1871
of
rights
arising
under
the
constitution,
there
were
clearly
referring
both
to
the
constitution
itself
and
to
the
implementing
legislation.
number
two,
the
constitution
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
directed
to
the
states
of
necessity
incorporates
the
privileges
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states.
from
his
long
ago,
as
the
solicitor
has
cases
it
has
been
made
clear
that
the
rights
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
spring
both
from
the
constitution
and
from
the
federal
statutes.
number
three,
in
point
of
fact
at
the
time
that
1983
was
enacted
in
1871
solely
with
the
constitutional
wording
it
took
cognizant
of
the
annexation
with
the
supremacy
clause
which
in
fact
spoke
of
the
primacy
of
federal
law.
so,
what
you
had
mr.
justice
white
was
in
1871
congressional
concern
about
both
constitutional
rights
and
rights
under
federal
statutes
and
in
point
of
fact
this
was
made
clear
three
years
later.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
those
rights
mr.
justice
white
would
include
of
necessity
all
rights
under
federal
law
for
the
three
reasons
that
i
mentioned.
number
one,
they
would
necessarily
embrace
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states.
number
two,
they
would
embrace
any
substantive
statutes
that
were
passed
by
congress
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
number
three,
they
would
embrace
supremacy
clause
which
itself
embraces
all
federal
statutes.
so,
i
think
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
i
feel
that
we
need
the
and
laws
language
today.
i
feel
that
the
lack
of
the
and
laws
language
for
that
three
year
hayedes
that
is
from
1871
to
1874
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
excuse
me.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
you
don't
need
it
if
you
read
and
laws
is
being
redundant.
i
don't
read
it
necessarily
as
being
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
no,
not
necessary.
i
don't
think
it's
redundant,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
congress
at
that
time
included
in
its
concept
of
the
constitution
both
constitution
and
laws
but
i
don't
think
it's
redundant
for
them
to
express
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
i
do.
i
rely
on
to
the
extent
that
it
in
fact
this
case
clearly
deals
with
the
federal
statutory
right.
and
in
point
of
fact,
i
did
not
plead
any
other
constitutional
basis
for
jurisdiction
and
indeed
that's
precisely
why
the
case
is
before
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
the
supremacy
clause
claim
is
of
necessity
included
in
the
pleadings
because
it
comes
under
1343.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
if
i'm
right
about
my
supremacy
clause
claim
i
do
not
need
the
and
laws
you're
correct.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
i
have
two
alternative
arguments
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
are
three
arguments
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
that's
correct
if
i
am.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
answer
to
your
question
about
swift
versus
wickham
i
think
that
that
case
in
fact
supports
our
position.
in
swift,
you
had
the
following
problem
as
a
result
of
ex
parte
young,
it
was
decided
that
the
federal
courts
could
interpose
themselves
and
enjoin
actions
by
state
officials.
this
case
rise
to
a
political
situation
under
what
circumstances
or
the
federal
courts
can
now
sit
and
enjoined
state's
statutes.
in
a
sort
of
compromised
situation,
there
was
enacted
at
three-judge
court
procedure
which
was
enacted
solely
to
lay
the
state's
fears
that
a
single
federal
district
court
judge
would
have
the
power
to
in
a
sense
interpose
himself
into
the
mechanism
of
state
government.
now,
during
the
progeny
if
you
will
or
the
paradigm
of
that
legislation,
we
find
that
the
court
carved
out
several
exceptions
and
one
of
them
was
where
there's
a
conflict
between
federal
law
and
state
law.
the
court
basically
said,
this
is
not
so
uniquely
a
state
problem.
that
states
would
be
all
that
concerned
about
it
and
would
require
us
in
a
sense
to
convene
a
three-judge
court
rather
this
is
by
its
very
nature
ie
by
the
existence
of
the
federal
statute;
a
federal
matter.
and
accordingly
the
court
said,
there's
probably
not
the
same
kind
of
state
concern
that
would
exist
if
we
were
dealing
solely
with
an
isolated
state
statute.
now,
i
submit
that
that
rational
is
uniquely
applicable
to
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
the
cases
under
swift,
the
exception
to
the
convocation
of
the
three-judge
court
occurred
when
you
had
both
of
federal
statute
and
a
state
statute
as
suppose
to
simply
a
state
statute
and
i'm
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
i
do
and
i'm
saying
that
there
is
not
the
same
state
concern
in
those
situations
and
that's
precisely
why
this
type
of
case
is
readdressable
and
should
be
brought
in
federal
court.
what
i'm
saying
is
it
doesn't
accept
all
the
delicate
bounds
of
federalism.
it's
not
as
though
the
state
court
was
in
a
sense
interposing
itself
again
in
matters
of
pure
state
law.
what
you
have
is
assuming
federal
statute
and
who
--
which
body
is
most
geared
to
if
you
will
is
the
most
natural
repository
of
experience
with
federal
law.
it's
the
federal
court,
i
don't
mind
pointing
out
in
terms
of
practicality
that
as
a
welfare
attorney
when
you
go
into
a
state
court
and
start
asking
at
the
outset
for
federal
judge
to
interpret
the
federal
statute
he
run
into
very
many
difficulties.
let
me
just
cite
a
few
for
instance
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
where
i
practice.
you
often
that
with
the
argument
that
federal
statute
that
must
mean
that
hew
is
in
an
indispensable
party.
we
don't
have
any
jurisdiction
over
a
federal
agency,
go
to
federal
court
that's
in
the
atchison
case
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief.
in
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
excuse
me?
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
no,
i
believe
that
congress
gave
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
very
clearly.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
no,
if
i
was
saying
that
i
didn't
mean
to.
what
i
was
pointing
out
was
that
i
think
that
the
state
courts
in
point
of
fact
view
this
case
in
the
same
that
we're
urging
it
should
be
viewed
and
that
is
the
repository
for
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
statute
should
be
the
federal
courts.
that's
all
i
was
trying
to
say.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
the
name
of
case
is
in
this
appendix
to
my
petitioners
brief;
it's
atchison
versus
the
department
of
institutions
and
agencies
to
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
there
was
a
conflict
there
urged
between
a
federal
food
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
no,
it
applies
in
terms
of
its
rational.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
point
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
it
is
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
though
that
the
federal
courts
have
a
certain
experience
dealing
with
the
federal
statutes
dealing
with
the
federal
mechanism
and
i
think
that
in
terms
of
article
3,
section
2
of
the
constitution,
the
federal
judiciary
power
clearly
extends
to
cases
dealing
both
with
the
constitution
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
i
don't
think
i
was
saying
that.
i
think
what
i
was
saying
was
that
federal
judges
are
more
experienced
than
learner
with
the
interpretation
of
federal
statutes
then
or
state
judges.
i
was
saying
that
when
the
focal
point
of
the
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
i
don't
think
that
that's
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
proper
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
i
think
that
that's
sort
of
like
placing
in
somewhat
of
bond.
i
think
there's
a
natural
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
i
think
he
does.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
i
think
the
federal
judge
does
know
more
federal
law
than
a
state
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
no,
certainly
not.
but
i
thin
that
there
is
the
experiential
level
and
i
think
that
that's
not
--
that
of
course
is
not
the
juridical
reason
why
this
case
should
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
petitioners.
because
i'm
merely
stating
that
that's
a
practical
reason
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
i
think
that
in
point
of
fact
though
the
federal
judiciary
is
more
equipped
to
interpret
federal
statutes.
in
addition,
to
the
new
jersey
problem
that
i
mentioned
you
have
a
problem
for
instance
in
mississippi
where
there's
no
right
to
go
in
to
state
court
on
appeal
in
one
of
these
types
of
situations.
so,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
really
is
not
what
might
be
tend
to
viable
alternative
to
have
a
federal
statute
interpreted
other
than
the
federal
court.
and
i
would
ask
the
court
that
when
i
consider
the
language
of
this
statute
of
1983
and
1343
to
please
keep
that
in
mind
and
to
not
act
as
though.
well,
this
is
in
some
sense
and
academic
exercise
on
related
to
the
realties
of
the
practice.
let
me
move
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
that
would
be
the
only
circumstance
on
an
appeal,
that
would
be
the
only
constitutional
but
as
we
argue
in
this
case
we
believe
that
the
jurisdiction
rest
even
a
part
from
the
supremacy
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
that
would
be
through
the
interconnection
of
the
and
laws
clause
of
the
1983
and
the
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
protection
of
equal
rights
and
the
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights.
so,
i
think
that
there
are
three
alternative
ways
in
which
jurisdiction
can
be
interpreted
here
and
we
feel
that
all
three
of
them
are
valuable
and
it
wouldn't
be
--
it
would
not
justify
our
clients
to
simply
be
force
to
rely
in
each
instance
on
an
appeal
under
the
supremacy
clause
from
the
state
supreme
court
to
the
federal
supreme
court,
particularly,
since
you
have
an
issue
federal
statutes.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
well,
of
course
at
the
present
time
it's
very,
very
difficult
because
some
of
the
arising
under
cases
have
been
interpreted
to
exclude
for
constitutional
reasons
--
the
supremacy
clause
and
if
in
point
of
fact,
the
only
thing
that
we
were
left
within
a
constitutional
sense
that
is
the
only
thing
that
would
give
us
a
clear
right
of
action
in
terms
of
an
appeal
to
united
states
supreme
court
was
that
supremacy
clause
issue.
it
could
be
difficult
but
certainly
if
we
were
trying
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
on
the
ground
of
a
conflict
1983,
1343
and
laws
we
have
to
go
by
cert
and
as
you
can
well
imagine
that's
very
difficult.
so,
again,
i
think
this
point
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
no,
i
understand
that
and
there
are
certainly
a
mechanism
at
a
reason
for
that
but
i
think
that
nowhere
will
you
find
a
situation
where
you
have
a
direct
federal
statute
in
conflict
with
the
state
statute
having
a
federal
courts
say
but
we
really
don't
have
jurisdiction
over
that.
i
mean,
i
believe
in
the
case
prior
mr.
justice
stewart
said
well,
when
we're
dealing
with
the
federal
statute
we're
of
necessity
dealing
with
the
question
of
federal
law.
this
is
not
i
urge
you
to
remember;
$10,000.00
consideration.
in
the
$10,000.00
area
congress
said
this,
if
you
have
a
right
under
a
federal
statute,
congress
may
decide
to
not
give
jurisdiction.
for
reasons
of
judicial
administration
in
the
like.
that's
a
far
different
question
than
the
delicate
balance
of
federalism
which
is
subsume
in
our
case
and
that
is,
has
congress
ever
indicated
that
it
will
not
afford
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
a
cause
of
action
and
jurisdiction
in
federal
court
when
the
deprivation
of
the
federal
right
is
by
virtue
of
intervening
state
action.
i
submit
that
congress
has
not
only
not
said
that
has
said
exactly
the
contrary
in
1983
and
1343.
let
us
move
if
we
will
for
a
minute
to
an
argument
that
was
touched
on
previously
--
1343(4).
let's
now
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
i'm
not
through
with
it.
no,
it's
just
a
question
i
have
to
say.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
i
categorically
take
the
position
that
they're
broader
and
they
have
to
be
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
so
--
well,
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
there's
not
a
gap
if
you
read
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
as
being
coextensive
with
1983.
i
don't
think
that
gap
exists.
i
certainly
think
that
the
words
and
laws
in
1983
embrace
all
federal
statute.
did
--
do
you
see
that
that
difference
so
in
saying
that
and
laws
is
broader
than
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
equal
rights
of
citizens.
i'm
not
admitting
to
a
gap
between
1343
and
1983
at
all.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
that
yes,
exactly
it's
suppose
can
do
it
in
a
cause
of
actions
in
somewhat
the
rational
in
the
ruby
but
that
was
accepted
in
both
vasquez
and
in
gomez.
and
again,
it
tracks
back
to
what
congress
was
all
about
in
1871
which
was
protection
of
federal
statutes.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
bottom
of
this
case
if
you
accept
the
interpretation
of
my
adversaries,
you're
of
necessity
riding
in
a
conclusion
that
somehow
congress
back
then
was
only
interested
in
what
might
be
called
two
statutes
--
the
enforcement
act
of
1866
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
i
believe
it
was
1870
which
dealt
with
this
question
of
racially
quality.
but
i
think
again
the
history
doesn't
support
that
because
the
thirteenth
amendment
dealt
clearly
with
racially
quality
and
the
thirteenth
amendment
extended
to
private
parties,
it
didn't
even
need
stay
action.
it
was
to
any
--
if
you
will
any
deprivation
of
rights
because
of
racially
quality.
now,
if
we
were
here
today
with
the
thirteenth
amendment,
okay,
then
i
would
not
be
able
to
argue
that
and
laws
embraced
all
federal
statutes.
but
the
game
changed
between
1866
and
1870
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
problem
there
was
that
they
wanted
--
congress
wanted
federal
rights
to
be
vindicated.
and
what
they
said
was,
we'll
limit
the
breadth
of
our
juridical
interest
by
saying
it's
going
to
be
state
action
that
interferes
with
you.
but
with
that
limit,
there
are
no
other
limits
these
of
the
nature
of
the
rights
that
we
want
to
indicate
it.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
and
in
point
of
fact
i
disagree
with
previous
counsel.
i
think
that
situation
exist
even
in
as
applied
situation.
i
think
that
there
would
be
just
simply
too
much
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall,
civil
rights
is
in
surplusage
in
1343(3)
and
(4)
because
1983
is
the
quintessence
if
you
will
of
the
civil
rights
act
that's
why
it's
not
surplusage
but
1983
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
you
do
need
--
you
still
need
1983.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
you
do
need
civil
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
you
never
need
subparagraph
4
because
there's
jurisdiction
under
subparagraph
3.
yes,
that's
a
wholly
different
issue.
that's
--
if
you
can
view
to
such
and
add
on
jurisdictional
can
do
it
but
that's
not
necessary
if
we
get
through
1343(3).
and
i
think
it's
very
important
why
we're
on
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
correct,
in
order
to
invoke
them
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
and
i
think
this
court
noted
in
the
footnote
in
lynch
and
i
think
mr.
justice
ferguson
when
he
was
talking
about
gas
which
was
having
when
he
was
talking
in
price
dealing
with
241.
the
plain
english
language
says
and
laws.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
restrict
that
it
doesn't
say
every
person
when
the
color
of
any
statute
etcetera
by
the
constitution
and
laws
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
and
that's
interesting
because
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
excuse
me.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
exactly.
i
think
that
congress
didn't
have
to
if
you
accept
my
interpretation
of
3.
if
you
don't
accept
my
interpretation
of
3,
then
of
course
from
my
view
point
congress
didn't
need
too.
and
the
very
interesting
about
that
question
is
that
seems
to
be
exactly
what
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
well,
i
think
that
that
brings
up
a
whole
different
issue.
i
don't
agree
with
that
statement.
i
think
that
your
reason
for
none
acceptance
of
3
might
be
that
and
i'm
just
doing
this
argue
when
though
might
be
that
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
equal
rights
bill
but
i
think
even
if
he
didn't
satisfy
the
equal
rights
of
3
it
clearly
satisfies
the
civil
rights
of
4
for
a
number
of
reasons.
number
one,
john
versus
meyer
went
back
and
an
excise
1972
a
companion
statute
dealing
with
the
rights
of
the
purchase
and
i
think
that
this
court
just
last
term
in
munell
indicated
very
clearly
that
1983
is
in
fact
a
civil
rights
act.
in
moore
versus
county
of
alameda
when
1988
was
distinguished
the
court
specifically
said,
1988
is
not
an
act
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
unlike
1983.
in
rachel
versus
georgia
when
we
were
dealing
with
removal,
the
court
said,
the
precursor
to
the
removal
statute
is
not
an
act
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
like
1983.
so,
what
we
have
is
a
litany
of
acceptance
of
the
proposition
that
1983
is
in
point
of
fact
and
point
of
syntax
and
point
of
history
and
act
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights.
so,
to
that
extent
mr.
justice
stewart
even
if
you
didn't
accept
my
argument
under
3
for
the
reasons
that
it
doesn't
flesh
with
equal
rights.
it
would
not
follow
a
forth
certiorari
that
it
doesn't
satisfy
4.
i
only
wanted
to
make
clear
that
if
you
accept
my
argument
with
3,
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
for
our
purposes
whether
you
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
both
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
mr.
justice
stewart,
both
arguments
have
to
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
require
the
and
laws
exactly.
there's
no
way
that
--
so,
it's
really
like
if
you
will
two
issues
with
the
same
sub-issue.
you
can't
get
around
the
and
laws
but
i
say
to
you
again,
it
does
say
and
laws
it
does
not
restrict.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
i
believe
that
justice
learned
hand
in
bowmar
versus
keith
accepted
this
line
of
reasoning
where
the
problem
with
the
new
york
school
teacher
who
went
on
jury
duty
pursuant
to
a
federal
statute
and
loss
her
job
and
brought
an
action
under
1983
and
1343
and
if
i
recall
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
it's
clear
that
these
statutes
were
meant
to
deal
with
federal
rights
--
federal
statutory
rights.
so,
i
think
that
there
is
support.
i
also
think
that
in
edelman
versus
jordan
mr.
justice
rehnquist
noted
that
it's
somewhat
clear
that
1983
embraces
civil
rights
act
under
its
and
laws
provision.
so,
i
think
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
but
you
know
i
think
that
the
quote
that
i
was
referring
to
in
this
court
would
embraces
the
social
security
act.
in
edelman
versus
jordan,
the
court
noted
that
1983
embraces
the
social
security
act
under
its
and
laws
clause.
and
i'm
saying
that
that
rational
would
support
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
request.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
i'm
sorry
i
have
misstated.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
i
don't
think
it
can
be
clearly
argue
that
way
because
that
misperceives
the
entire
rational
of
this
court
in
examining
board
versus
florida
as
where
noted
their
complementary
germination.
and
number
two,
the
key
wording
of
these
statutes
does
not
require
the
creation
of.
it
talks
about
secured
by
protection
of
which
is
of
necessity
what
1983
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
all
about.
so,
i
don't
think
that's
a
valid
distinction.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
in
edelman
versus
jordan,
i
believe
that
the
court
indicated
that
the
social
security
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
there
--
it
was
not
in
the
holding.
it
was
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
right,
there's
none
specifically
other
than
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
you
have
to
hold
that
for
me
to
win
on
1343(4).
you
don't
have
to
hold
that
specifically
for
me
to
win
on
1343(3)
if
you
want
to
make
that
by
application
to
embrace
the
and
laws.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
1393?
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
1983
if
we
satisfy
the
and
laws
okay,
then
we
would
have
to
satisfy
would
be
either
43(3)
or
(4).
we
wouldn't
have
to
satisfy
both.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
1983
was
talking
about
the
deprivation
of
federal
rights
not
--
it
was
not
--
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
it's
generically
a
civil
rights
act
but
it
embraces
the
deprivation
of
federal
rights
by
state
into
position.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
you
have
to
find
that
the
social
security
act
is
in
fact
included
within
the
phrase
and
laws
that's
all
you
have
to
find.
you
don't
have
to
go
any
further
and
characterize
it.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
no,
i
don't
agree
that
i
think
that
you
have
to
find
that
1983
through
its
and
laws
conduit
embraces
the
social
security
act.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
go
further
and
get
into
a
characterization
of
welfare
being
civil
rights
in
the
light.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
rational
was
not
holding
wise
in
the
peacock
case.
mr.
theodore
a.
gardner
yes,
in
different
statute
and
specifically
i
think
it's
interesting
that
in
rachel
versus
georgia,
the
court
refused
to
expand
1443
to
include
a
broad
brush
because
they
said,
congress
didn't
do
in
1443
would
it
did
in
1983.
which
is
really
our
argument.
they
said
that
congress
might
have
done
it
if
they
had
so
chosen
but
they
didn't
do
it
and
accordingly
when
congress
was
dealing
with
this
rather
restrictive
removal
mechanism
they
limited
to
rights
guaranteed
not
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
by
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
you're
into
the
question
of
racially
quality
which
is
really
what
are
our
adversaries
are
trying
to
do
in
this
case.
they're
trying
to
slide
the
entire
court
into
rachel
versus
georgia
in
a
kind
of
obscuring
manner
and
say,
by
the
racially
quality
argument.
and
that's
the
end
of
it
because
obviously
the
social
security
act
doesn't
provide
for
racial
equality.
thank
you.
