justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro,
i
wasn't
quite
as
clear
as
you
seem
to
be
as
to
what
question
is
presented
by
the
commission's
brief,
because
i
realize
that
the
order
adopted
by
the
commission
says
that
on
or
after
july
30th,
1976
all
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
will
contain
this
provision.
and
yet,
if
you
turn
to
page
16
of
the
brief
for
the
commission.
the
first
sentence
in
the
first
full
paragraph
says,
the
principle
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
natural
gas
act
imposes
an
obligation
on
certificate
holders,
which
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
to
enforce
that
they
act
as
reasonably
as
prudent
operators
have
maintained
deliveries
to
interstate
commerce
of
gas
from
dedicated
reserves
and
you
go
on
to
say
that
this
is
going
to
have
viable
importance
for
many,
many
years,
because
apparently
it
is
incorporated
by
force
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
certificates
issued
prior
to
1976,
is
that
your
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
little
different
than
saying
that
the
commission
was
empowered
to
choose
this
as
a
regulation
implementing
the
statute
isn't
it.
that's
saying
that
the
statute
required
the
commission
to
do
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
is
an
interpretative
regulation
that
was
adopted
by
the
commission
in
1976.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
commission
made
this
point
quite
as
clearly
to
the
fifth
circuit
as
you
are
making
it
us?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
i
mean
the
difference
between
a
simple
regulation
by
the
commission
and
a
provision
that
is
implicit
in
the
natural
gas
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
just
leaves
the
exclusion
out
of
the
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
enforceable,
the
thing
that
is
excluded
by
the
act
is
then
enforceable
by
the
commission,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
shows
some
rational
connection
with
the
service
obligation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
that
-
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
believe
that
some
body
of
law
is
implicit
in
the
act
such
as
mr.
shapiro
has
said.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
the
reason
the
commission
gave
is
it
for
its
interpretative
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
there's
something
either
in
this
court's
decision
or
in
the
statute
which
authorizes
the
development
of
some
sort
of
a
federal
service
standard.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
clearly
in
the
act
or
clearly
in
this
court's
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
does
that
leave
the
exclusion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
johnson
aren't
the
states
still
regulating
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
are
already
saying
that
the
reason
the
commission
never
got
around
this
until
1976
was
because
the
states
were
actively
regulating.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
is,
why
did
they
get
around
to
it
in
‘76
if
the
states
haven't
ceased
regulating.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
may
be
i
should
ask
you
–
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
even
if
the
commission
agreed
there
was
no
gap,
do
you
believe
them.
you
would
still
object
to
another
level
of
regulation?
