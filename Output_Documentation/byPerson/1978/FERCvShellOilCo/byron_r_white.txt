justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
commission
ever
taken
a
different
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
should
have
taken
a
far
more
expensive
view
in
this
very
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
find
that
to
be
implicit
in
the
act
did
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
statute
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
permissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
required.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
the
position
is
that
that
a
prudent
operator
standard
is
implicit
in
the
act,
but
it
is,
that's
required
by
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
commission's
position
is
that
its
view
of
the
prudent
operator
standard
is
a
nationwide
one
or
and
that
it's
independent
of
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
does
it
have
any
content
other
than
what
it
might
have
under
the
local
law.
does
the
federal
law,
does
this
rule
now
just
pick
up
local
law,
whatever
it
might
be,
is
that
the
extent
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
far
as
you
can
tell
from
the
order
it
imposes,
no
further
duty
than
the
state
law
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
there
might
be
a
lot
of
different
duties
depending
on
what
state
you
are
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
-
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
state
hadn't
allowed
the
rule
about
what
the
allowable
production
was,
would
the
commission,
does
this
case
suggest
the
commission
could
set
a
different
one
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
shapiro
i
suppose
the
law
has
said
that,
keep
your
nose
out
of
production
and
gathering
even
if
it
serves
some
deliverability
and
i
suppose
you
can
say
then,
congress
just
said
don't
use
this
means
of
guaranteeing
the
service
obligation.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
think
the
statute
says
that
-
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
that
production
of
gathering
is
not
your
business,
but
you
say
it
is
your
business
as
long
as
it
serves
a
service
obligation.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
maybe
so,
but
the
commission
hadn't
discovered
that
enormous
gap
for
quite
a
while.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
it
took
quite
sometime
for
there
to
be
discovered
any
obligation
over
producers
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
some
state
dismantled
its
enforcement
and
its
rules
and
said
that
we're
going
to
deregulate
it,
you
know,
just
turn
the
producers
lose,
we
aren't
going
to
put
them
under
any
conservation
orders
or
anything
else.
does
that
put
you
out
of
business
in
that
state
as
far
as
any
prudent
operator
standards
considered?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
some,
so
you
suggested
as
soon
the
commission
decides
that
some
state
standard
doesn't
satisfy
it,
it
will
go
off
on
its
own.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
weren't
up
against
any
express
limitation
on
the
commission's
jurisdictions
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
blame
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't.
suppose
they
haven't
got
the
jurisdiction
to
do
what
the
commission
is
doing,
where
does
that
leave
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
defending
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
any
gap
to
inspect
just
production
and
gathering.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
the
time
the
natural
gas
act
was
passed.
there
wasn't
any
gap
in
respect
to
production
and
gatherings.
justice
byron
r.
white
had
it
been
held
at
the
interstate
commerce
of
commission
for
bad
the
states
from
a
regulating
production
and
gathering.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
theoretically
possible
they
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
surprised
you
answered
mr.
justice
stevens
with
a
yes
on
his
hypothetical.
it
is
just
as
much
production
and
gathering.
negligent
production
and
gathering
is
negligent
production
and
gathering,
it
is
still
production
and
gathering.
