mr.
howard
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
cases
involve
the
obligations
of
producers
to
supply
natural
gas
under
the
natural
gas
act
of
1938.
the
case
concerns
a
statement
of
policy
developed
in
an
informal
rule
making
proceeding
conducted
by
the
predecessor
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
the
federal
power
commission.
the
commission
undertook
to
determine
what
standard
of
deliverability,
a
certificated
producer
of
natural
gas
is
required
to
live
up
to
under
the
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act.
the
policy
the
commission
eventually
adopted
requires
producers
of
dedicated
gas
to
produce
gas
they
are
required
to
supply
under
their
certificates.
under
the
standard
of
a
prudent
operator
as
that
standard
is
reflected
in
state
laws
governing
production.
there
are
two
petitions
here;
the
first
is
the
petition
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
which
inquires
whether
the
production
and
gathering
exclusion
in
section
1b
of
the
natural
gas
act
bars
the
commission
from
adopting
the
prudent
operator
standard
as
the
delivery
criteria
under
the
natural
gas
act.
the
second
petition
is
by
the
consumer
energy
council
of
america
and
it
contends
that
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
adopt
a
deliverability
standard
that
affects
production,
but
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
prudent
operator
standard
is
an
inappropriate
standard.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
commission
was
barred
by
section
1b
of
the
natural
gas
act,
particularly
the
production
and
gathering
exclusion
in
section
1b
from
adopting
a
prudent
operator
standard.
so
the
court
of
appeal
said
that
the
commission
had
gone
too
far
in
adopting
the
standard.
the
consumers
argue
that
the
commission
did
not
go
far
enough
and
that
the
prudent
operator
standard
doesn't
meet
the
requirements
of
the
act.
the
consumers
have
with
the
court's
permission
conceded
three
minutes
to
the
commission
in
the
division
of
time
in
this
case,
so
that
the
commission
would
have
23
minutes,
the
consumers
17.
mr.
howard
shapiro
that
is
the
position
your
honor.
mr.
howard
shapiro
well,
essentially
the
commission's
position
is,
it
has
made
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
define
what
the
standard
of
deliverability
is.
what
it
found
in
this
rule
making
proceeding
was
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
as
to
just
what
producers
obligations
were
to
deliver
gas
and
it
concluded
in
the
ultimate
decision
order
number
539
b,
that
there
was
implicit
in
the
delivery
obligation
that
exists
under
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act.
an
obligation
to
maintain
delivery
that
reaches
the
duty
to
at
least
see
that
there
is
sufficient
gas
produced
to
meet
the
obligation.
the
commission
found
that
this
was
implicit
in
existing
certificates
and
that
it
was
inappropriate
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
the
service
obligation
had
been
defined
by
this
court
in
–
mr.
howard
shapiro
1938
your
honor.
mr.
howard
shapiro
yes
your
honor.
one
reason
that
the
question
had
not
come
to
the
fore
was
because
as
long
as
there
was
more
gas
available
then
it
could
meet
more
gas
available
in
the
market
would
absorb.
there
was
a
little
question
that
every
producer
would
try
to
deliver
all
the
gas
he
could
and
market
all
the
gas
he
could.
when
the
gas
shortage
of
the
late
60s
and
early
70s
developed,
questions
began
to
arise
as
to
just
what
the
duty
of
the
producer
was.
now
the
commission's
order
in
this
case
did
not
rest
on
any
findings
that
there
had
been
some
diversion
of
gas
to
the
unregulated
intrastate
market
from
the
regulated
interstate
market,
but
the
commission
did
find
that
there
was
great
uncertainty
as
to
the
scope
of
the
deliverability
obligation
and
it
undertook
to
define
that,
it's
ultimate
answer
was
that
implicit
and
existing
certificates
under
this
court's
decisions
in
sunray
and
for
that
matter
in
california
versus
southland
was
an
obligation
not
simply
to
sell
gas
as
a
commodity,
but
also
to
deliver
gas
until
there
was
an
authorization
from
the
commission
to
seize
delivery.
now
justice
rehnquist's
questions
have
touched
on
another
matter
i
should
briefly
mention.
in
november
of
1978,
congress
passed
the
national
gas
policy
act.
that
new
statute
changes
the
basis
of
regulation
for
the
future
rather
significantly.
it
extends
price
control
to
both
the
intrastate
market
and
the
interstate
market.
however,
it
also
expressly
continues
in
effect
non-price
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
act
for
gas
previously
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce.
that
gas
is
therefore
still
impressed
with
the
service
obligation
that
would
apply
to
dedicated
gas
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
is
still
subject
to
the
requirement
that
it
continued
to
be
delivered
until
abandonment
authority
is
obtained.
the
matter
is
significant
because
among
other
things,
pricing
under
the
new
statute
for
gas
previously
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce
is
somewhat
lower
than
prices
for
other
categories
of
gas.
mr.
howard
shapiro
well,
the
natural
gas
policy
act
hadn't
been
passed.
mr.
howard
shapiro
yes,
it
did
your
honor
it's
expressly
stated
in
that
order
what
they
expressly
declared
was
that
they
made,
they
found
this
standard
to
be
implicit
in
existing
certificates
and
they
said
that
this
implicit
standard
should
be
made
explicit
in
future
certificates.
now
section
1b
defines
the
scope
of
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
howard
shapiro
with
respect
to
it's
jurisdiction
and
the
nature
of
the
delivery
obligation,
certainly
not
since
sunray.
sunray
clarified
the
nature
-
mr.
howard
shapiro
in
this
proceeding
the
commission
first
undertook
to
adopt
what
i
would
call
a
quantitative
delivery
obligation.
mr.
howard
shapiro
it
found
it
to
be
implicit
in
certificates;
it
thought
originally
that
it
was
reflected
in
certificates
and
in
existing
contracts
that
underlays.
mr.
howard
shapiro
and
it
thought
that
it
was
permissible
to
impose
the
standard
on
the
statute.
mr.
howard
shapiro
that's
right.
mr.
howard
shapiro
but
not
required.
mr.
howard
shapiro
a
deliverability
standard
is
required
that
assures
the
maintenance
of
delivery
and
this
is
the
standard
the
commission
feels
is
the
appropriate
standard
to
achieve
that
result.
now
section
1(b)
defines
the
scope
of
the
natural
gas
act.
it
affirmatively
states
that
the
act
covers
transportation
of
natural
gas
in
the
interstate
commerce.
sale
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale
to
consumers.
and
natural
gas
companies
engaged
in
such
transportation
or
sales.
it
expressly
excludes
other
transportation
or
sales,
local
distribution
and
distribution
facilities
and
the
exclusion
involved
here
the
production
and
gathering
of
natural
gas.
this
court's
decisions
in
sunray
and
in
california
versus
southland
however
have
made
clear
that
the
term
“sale”
as
it
is
used
in
the
statute
both
in
section
1(b)
and
elsewhere
carries
with
it
an
additional
concept,
the
concept
of
service
and
that
service
as
applied
to
producers
is
an
obligation
to
maintain
delivery.
the
commission
concluded
after
going
through
a
rule
making
proceeding
that
moved
from
a
quantitative
requirement
to
the
prudent
operator
standard,
that
existing
certificates
are
subject
to
this
implied
requirement
and
they
then
defined
it.
they
said
that
the
standard
encompasses
the
obligation
to
develop
producing
properties
consistent
with
lease
agreements
and
with
all
valid
rules
and
regulations
of
any
federal
state
or
local
government
having
jurisdiction
and
the
standard
of
what
a
reasonably
prudent
operator
would
do
with
respect
to
the
drilling,
completion;
work
over,
re-completion
or
abandonment
of
wells.
mr.
howard
shapiro
the
commission's
view
as
to
the
content
of
the
prudent
operator
standard
has
reflected
in
its
order
and
i
can
take
it
no
further
than
that
at
this
time,
is
that
it
does
refer
directly
to
local,
state
and
local
conservation
laws
for
example,
statutory,
regulatory
requirements
of
the
states
relating
to
production.
it
also
refers
to
the
standard
as
adapted
from
the
law
governing
mineral
leases
between
lessees
between
land
owners
and
producers.
mr.
howard
shapiro
as
far
as
the
commission
has
taken
it,
it
does
make
an
obligation
under
the
natural
gas
act,
the
same
duty
that
the
producers
are
already
under--
mr.
howard
shapiro
as
far
as
the
decision
goes
at
present
that
is
right.
mr.
howard
shapiro
producers
would
be
operating
locally
in
different
states
and
the
nature
of
their
duty
might
vary
locally
as
a
result.
there
maybe
some
difference
in
conservation
requirements.
this
is
just
an
example
of
a
federal
law
referring
to
a
state
standard.
now
the
producers
themselves
in
these
proceedings
argue
that
the
commission
should
not
adopt
any
standard
of
deliverability
affecting
their
production,
because
they
were
already
subject
to
a
prudent
operator
standard
and
the
commission
concluded
that
they
knew
what
the
prudent
operator
standard
meant
since
they
themselves
were
making
this
argument.
mr.
howard
shapiro
and
they
had
adopted
it
to
the
federal
obligation.
mr.
howard
shapiro
no,
the
commission
was
quite
careful
not
to
try
and
setup
as
a
result
of
this
standard
any
requirement
that
would
go
beyond
or
go
into
conflict
with
what
the
state
required
with
respect
to
production.
any
valid
state
production
standard
remains
in
effect
today
without
regard
to
the
adoption
of
this
standard,
it
was
not
designed
to
set
up
a
new
standard,
it
was
designed
to
apply
under
section
7,
the
operating
standard
that
the
producers
are
already
under.
now
there
was
a
reason
for
that,
they
went
to
some
length
to
avoid
conflict
with
the
state
law,
because
as
this
court
has
interpreted
the
production
and
gathering
exclusion
in
section
1(b)
it
has
often
said
that
it
applies
to
the
physical
activities
of
producing
gas,
which
are
in
the
domain
of
the
states.
the
commission
is
not
trying
to
set
itself
up
as
a
super
conservation
agency
or
a
super
production
agency,
what
it
is
trying
to
do
is
to
assure
the
maintenance
of
delivery
under
section
7
under
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
howard
shapiro
i
don't
know
that
for
purposes
of
this
case
we
would
have
to
treat
them
as
significantly
different.
the
development
the
commission
refers
to
and
the
production
the
commission
refers
to
is
the
development
of
dedicated
acreage
that
is
already
subject
to
a
service
obligation
under
the
natural
gas
act.
in
short,
it
is
gas
which
has
already
been
marketed,
the
acreage
has
been
marketed
and
the
gas
producer
has
committed
himself
to,
has
undertaken
the
obligation
to
supply
gas
to
a
pipeline.
he
has
to
continue
that
supply
until
he
is
authorized
to
abandon
and
if
it's
not
depleted
the
essence
of
the
commission's
position
is,
he's
got
to
at
least
maintain
enough
production
to
meet
his
obligation
to
deliver
gas.
mr.
howard
shapiro
i
think
it
sometimes
means
that
there
will
be
additional
development.
for
example,
i
have
seen
references
to,
i've
seen
leases,
not
leases
but
certificates
with
underlying
contracts
in
which
the
dedication
in
effect
says
that
we
dedicate
all
gas
that
will
be
produced
on
this
acreage
to
the
service
of
some
particular
pipeline.
mr.
howard
shapiro
what
the
commission
would
look
to
is
whether
it
would
be
prudent
under
the
state
standards
for
the
operator
to
drill
additional
holes
in
order
to
meet
his
delivery
obligation.
however,
these
are
questions
which
are
somewhat
in
the
future
since
the
commission
has
gone
no
further
here
and
got
no
further
then
to
announce
what
the
standard
would
be
-
mr.
howard
shapiro
that
i
think
-
mr.
howard
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
shapiro
yes
sir,
the
analysis
really
is
that
section
1(b)
anything
that
is
within
the
affirmative
grant
in
section
1(b)
of
jurisdiction
over
sales
is
not
barred
by
the
production
and
gathering
exclusion
that's
what
the
court
has
held
in
cases
like
interstate
natural
gas
company
against
fpc
in
331.
the
production
and
gathering
exclusion
doesn't
take
away
what
is
affirmatively
granted,
but
if
as
we
in
the
court
has
held
the
term
“sales”
includes
a
service
obligation
to
deliver
gas,
it
necessarily
has
to
include
an
obligation
to
produce
enough
gas
to
deliver,
because
if
there
is
no
production,
there
is
no
delivery.
mr.
howard
shapiro
it
leaves
in
place
the
state's
jurisdiction
over
the
manner
in
which
production
will
be
-
mr.
howard
shapiro
it
does
make
the
state
standard
–
mr.
howard
shapiro
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
shapiro
well,
the
consequence
otherwise
is
to
leave
an
enormous
gap
in
the
regulatory
scheme
that
congress
intended
to
fill.
mr.
howard
shapiro
well,
the
need
for
defining
it
as
i
have
explained
became
more
and
more
urgent
in
the
late
70s.
mr.
howard
shapiro
it
took
many
years,
it
was
1954
before
that
was
fully
developed
and
it
was
1964
before
sunray,
so
that
this
been
a
process
of
gradual
development.
now
the
point
about
the
gap
is
that
if
you
leave
the
statute
where
the
court
of
appeals
has
left
it,
producers
retain
an
unregulated
choice
as
to
whether
to
supply
natural
gas,
because
they
can
say
we
do
not
wish
to
produce
if
they
left
the
wells
-
mr.
howard
shapiro
i
think
that
in
the
absence
of
specific
conservation
requirements
by
statute
and
regulation
within
the
state,
the
commission
would
look
to
the
general
common
law
applicable
to
relationships
among
lessors
and
lessees,
which
also
implies
a
prudent
operator
standard
and
an
obligation
not
to
produce
in
a
way
that
damages
the
property.
mr.
howard
shapiro
no,
i
think
that
the
commission
will
look
to
what
are
already
valid
state
standards.
now
the
law
provides
and
this
court
has
held
at
some
state
standards
are
invalid,
because
they're
irrational,
because
they're
not
related
to
conservation,
because
they
seek
to
regulate
price
or
embargo
shipment
that
kind
of
standard
would
be
invalid,
but
the
commission
has
attempted
to
coordinate
its
standard
fully
otherwise.
mr.
howard
shapiro
one
very
brief
statement
your
honor.
first,
the
state's
do
not
require
production
in
aid
of
interstate
delivery
obligation
under
the
natural
gas
act.
that
is
the
regulatory
gap.
second,
the
producers
have
stated
the
obligation
is
to
deliver
only
what
they
choose
to
produce,
if
they
choose
not
to
produce
or
they
choose
not
to
maintain
their
equipment,
there
will
be
no
gas
to
deliver,
hence
there
is
no
delivery
obligation
and
that
will
destroy,
seriously
undermine
the
dedication
concept
recognized
in
sunray
and
subsequent
cases.
mr.
howard
shapiro
there
will
be
no
delivery
obligation
under
the
statutes
your
honor,
because
the
contract
obligation
is
not
what
controls
under
the
natural
gas
act,
but
the
service
obligation
resulting
from
the
certification
of
the
sale
that's
the
doctrine
of
summary.
mr.
howard
shapiro
no,
you
said
no
contract
obligation.
mr.
howard
shapiro
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstand
your
question.
there
remains
a
duty
under
the
statute
to
deliver.
the
court
of
appeals
rather
inconsistency
said
the
ferc,
this
is
a
petition
on
page
7(a)
the
ferc
can
enforce
service
obligations
contained
in
the
certificates
that
it
issues
to
producers
preventing
producers
from
ceasing
delivers
from
fields
admittedly
capable
of
continuing
production.
now
the
word
admittedly
i
assume
refers
to
admitted
by
the
producer,
but
if
in
fact
the
field
can
produce
and
all
it
is
required
is
the
ordinary
prudent
actions
to
keep
it
producing
then
what
the
commission
is
saying
here
is
simply
that
they
should
take
those
steps
to
assure
that
they
produce
what
they
have
undertaken
to
deliver
and
that
is
the
essence
of
the
prudent
operator
standard.
finally,
the
consumers
argue
that
the
standard
goes
too
far,
but
the
standard
is
designed
to
accommodate
with
state
law,
it
is
not
designed
to
conflict
with
it.
