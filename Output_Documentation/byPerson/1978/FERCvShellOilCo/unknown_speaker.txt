unknown
speaker
if
we
look
at
it
without
regard
to
the
â€˜78
statute,
is
it
not
possible
at
the
time
the
regulation
was
passed
that
a
producer
might
have
had
a
economic
motive
for
desiring
to
get
out
of
federal
regulation,
be
free
to
sell
in
the
local
market
that
is
theoretically
possible
isn't
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn't
you
have
a
problem
where
say
if
you
drilled
another
well
or
made
some
improved
capital
investment
of
some
kind.
you
might
get
a
return
on
your
investment
at
the
local
price,
but
not
get
a
return
on
your
investment
at
the
interstate
price.
so,
if
you
are
stuck
with
the
interstate
market
you
just
wouldn't
make
the
investment.
unknown
speaker
not
if
he
gets
abandonment
approval.
unknown
speaker
and
isn't
it
possible
that
at
one
set
of
price
level,
you
could
get
abandonment
approval
by
not
making
further
capital
improvements.
i
don't
know
may
be
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
the
theoretically
possible.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
real
objection
to
the
present
regulation
of
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
can
live
with
the
state
authorities,
but
you
don't
want
another
level
of
regulation.
do
you
accept
the
commission's
statement
represented
in
here
that
the
rule
they
have
adopted
seats
only
to
implement
what
each
specific
state
would
implement.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
still
production
and
gathering,
where
did
they
get
the
power
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
no,
you
were
asked
what
your
position
was
and
seemed
to
say,
construe
the
act
to
permit
the
commission
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
you
totally
agree
with
the
court
of
appeal.
unknown
speaker
that
and
do
engage
in
some
activity
that
would
make
the
producer
have
the
wells
of
up
to
their
potential.
unknown
speaker
is
that
production
and
gathering?
unknown
speaker
mr.
johnson.
unknown
speaker
aren't
we
talking
about
situations
where
reserves
have
been
dedicated
under
contracts
say
with
natural
gas
pipeline
companies.
aren't
there
contracts
obligating
producers
to
deliver
gas
to
the
--
unknown
speaker
right,
but
let
me
follow
that
up.
suppose
a
producer
was
manifest
with
negligent
as
suggested
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
been
discussing
where
the
party
to
the
contract
said
if
the
natural
gas
pipeline
company
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
terms
of
the
contract
for
failure
to
perform
as
required
by
the
contract
itself.
unknown
speaker
do
these
contracts
require?
unknown
speaker
if
you
represented
a
pipeline
company
that
had
a
contract
for
the
deliver
of
natural
gas
and
you
found
that
the
producer
would
just
not
spend
a
nickel
on
maintenance
and
repairs
and
therefore
couldn't
fulfill
the
contract
or
you
would
take
no
action?
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
there
would
be
no
contract
delivery
obligation.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
you
are
conceding
that
if
they
deliberately
don't
maintain
their
equipment,
they
don't
have
any
obligation?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
that
is
their
view
of
the
statute.
