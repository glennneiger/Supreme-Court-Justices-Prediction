justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question
in
that
connection?
the
word,
“develop”
is
used
in
the
commission's
order,
the
exclusion
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
uses
a
word
“production,”
what's
the
difference
between
develop
and
production
as
a
practical
matter?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
when
acreage
is
committed,
does
that
mean
that
all
of
the
necessary
drilling
has
been
accomplished
or
does
that
lie
ahead
in
the
future?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
under
this
order,
is
it
your
view
that
the
commission
could
say
it
to
a
company
that
had
dedicated
say
a
1000
acres,
you
aren't
drilling
enough
holes
to
accomplish
the
deliverability
that
we
think
is
appropriate
and
you
must
accelerate
the
drilling
of
holes
or
wells
i
suppose
you
would
say?
