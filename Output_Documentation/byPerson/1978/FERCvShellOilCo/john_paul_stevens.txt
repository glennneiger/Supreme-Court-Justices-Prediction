the
market
price
has
something
to
do
with
it,
in
the
ratio
between
the
interstate
price
and
the
intrastate
price
–
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
it
conceivable
that
he
can
get
a
highest
amount
of
income
by
selling
in
the
local
market
rather
then
selling
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
regulation
was
adopted
before
the
‘78
statute
was
passed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
entirely
on
the
‘78
statute
–
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
johnson,
i
would
like
to
address
your
attention
to
the
example
the
commission
gives
in
its
reply
brief.
where
i
assume
you
are
extremely
negligent,
you
just
don't
make
elementary
repairs
or
maintenance
or
anything
in
your
supply
therefore
terminate.
do
they
have
the
authority
to
prevent
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
supposing
they
did
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
mind
as
long
as
eventually
you
tell
me
what
the
answer
is
to
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is,
assume
the
absurd
hypothetical
the
government
had
deposited,
do
they
have
regulatory
jurisdiction
to
step
in
that
particular
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
ordinary
maintenance
that
is
the
example
they
give
having
undertaken
the
most
elementary
maintenance
of
its
production
facility.
so,
they
fall
into
disrepair's
with
the
resulted
production
and
hence
delivery
is
ceased.
now
you
say
that's
absurd
to
think
that
would
ever
happen,
but
my
question
is
assuming
it
did
happen
would
the
commission
have
statutory
power
to
say
no
you
got
to
do
some
maintenance
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
we
know
the
commission
is
going
to
require
anything
more
then
this
in
interpreting
this
regulation
anything
else
is
–
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
they
are
going
to
require
to
drill
a
new
well.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
said
they
would
consider
that
didn't
they,
as
the
questions
of
speculations
were
reserved
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
commission
has
told
us
the
other
day
that
it
assumes
it
has
the
power
to
do
that
under
this
order
that
i
understood
mr.
shapiro
said
that.
he
said
that
they
hadn't
decided
whether
they
would,
but
that
they
have
the
power
under
this
order.
is
there
any
argument
about
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
your
whole
position
was
within
the
exclusion
was
no
power.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
any
event,
the
royalty
holder
would
have
some
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
almost
guaranteed
that
he
would
have
the
power
obviously.
