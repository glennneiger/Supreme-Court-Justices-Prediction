mr.
charles
hill
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
our
basic
contention
in
this
litigation
is
that
the
commission
has
acted
contrary
to
the
terms
of
the
natural
gas
act
by
adopting
as
the
standard
and
the
exclusive
standard
governing
producer
delivery
obligations
under
the
act,
a
body
of
state
law
which
has
been
developed
in
the
various
producers
states,
which
has
been
developed
for
reasons
altogether
different
than
continuation
of
steady
and
reliable
supply
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
there's
of
course
also
a
fundamental
jurisdictional
question
here
that
is
whether
or
not
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
enforce
those
obligations,
which
in
fact
certificate.
i
would
like
to
leave
that
jurisdictional
question
largely
to
our
briefs
into
the
argument
of
mr.
shapiro,
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
comment
and
that
is
the
comment
that
focuses
on
the
distinction
between
what
we
say
the
act
requires,
and
what
the
commission
has
done
here.
we
say
the
act
requires
an
extension
of
the
provisions
or
an
application
of
the
provisions
of
section
4(d)
and
section
7(b)
to
significant
declines
in
service.
that
means
that
the
commission
would
be
interposed
between
the
producer
and
the
ultimate
consumer
and
would
pass
upon
the
justification
for
significant
declines
in
delivery.
that
also
means
that
an
order
from
the
commission
would
not
be
in
the
form
of
an
order
telling
a
producer
to
drill
a
particular
well
in
this
place
or
take
some
action
in
some
other
place,
which
might
be
the
case
under
a
prudent
operator
standard,
but
the
order
that
would
emanate
from
the
commission
is
basically
the
sort
of
order
that
would
emanate
from
the
commission
when
a
producer
currently
comes
to
the
commission
and
says
under
4(d),
we
would
like
to
reduce
service
or
under
7(b)
we
would
like
to
have
a
partial
abandonment
that
is
either
yes
or
no,
we
accept
your
justification
for
a
decline
in
service
or
we
don't
accept
that
justification.
so
the
orders
that
we
can
see
coming
from
the
commission
in
the
course
of
applying
a
proper
delivery
standard
will
not
embroil
the
commission
in
questions
of
where
a
particular
well
should
be
located
or
what
actions
should
be
taken
in
the
field.
now,
this
case
takes
its
significance
from
the
fact
that
a
vast
network
of
investment
from
that
of
the
pipeline
to
the
end-user,
power
plant,
factory
or
consumer
has
been
built
upon
the
supply
obligations
under
the
natural
gas
act,
and
these
investments
and
the
interest
of
those
end-users
will
be
placed
significantly
at
risk
if
the
commission
lacks
the
jurisdiction
to
enforce
delivery
obligations
under
the
act
or
fails
to
do
so
under
a
proper
standard.
it
is
clear
from
section
4
and
section
7
of
the
act
that
one
of
the
prime
purposes
of
the
act
is
to
ensure
a
steady
and
reliable
service
or
supply
of
gas
in
the
interstate
market.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
purpose
as
recently
as
last
may
in
the
southland
decision
where
the
court
held
that
the
obligation
to
continue
service
even
in
the
face
of
terms
in
a
private
agreement,
which
may
run
contrary
to
that
obligation,
was
nevertheless
essential
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
charles
hill
that's
right
mr.
justice
white.
and
the
question
here
is
i
suppose
among
others
whether
this
prudent
operator
rule
is
within
the
production
and
gathering
exclusion.
well,
we
would
like
to
see
that
issue
cast
slightly
differently
and
that
is
whether
or
not
–
mr.
charles
hill
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
hill
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
utilize
and
in
fact
is
required
to
utilize
the
provisions
of
section
4(d)
and
7(b)
to
significant
declines
in
service.
i
don't
want
to
defend
jurisdictionally
what
the
commission
is
trying
to
do
here.
mr.
charles
hill
well,
my
hope
is
that
the
court
in
deciding
that.
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
decide
favorably
to
the
commission
on
that
issue,
but
then
move
on
to
our
issue.
mr.
charles
hill
in
that
sense,
yes.
mr.
charles
hill
that's
right.
what
the
commission
has
done
here
and
what
mr.
shapiro
clearly
admits
is
adopt
wholesale
as
the
exclusive
federal
standard,
a
body
of
state
law
which
has
been
designed
to
do
two
things.
one,
a
body
of
state
statutory
and
regulatory
law,
which
has
been
designed
to
place
limits
on
production
in
order
to
avoid
waste
and
another
body
of
state
law,
which
has
been
designed
to
govern
the
lessor/lessee
agreement.
i
hope
that
we
have
made
clear
in
our
brief
at
page
39
to
41
of
the
initial
brief
and
12
to
15
of
our
second
brief
that
the
principles
under
each
of
those
two
bodies
of
law
we're
not
designed
to
assure
continuation
of
service
and
in
fact
in
various
instances
will
militate
against
that
purpose.
therefore,
we
believe
that
the
commission
has
simply
violated
the
act
or
has
not
followed
the
act's
mandate
by
adopting
this
body
of
state
law.
mr.
charles
hill
i
believe
that
building
upon
this
court's
decision
in
sunray
and
southland
that
they're
clearly
are
obligations
to
continue
service
under
the
act
and
that
obligation
requires
a
producer
when
he's
contemplating
a
significant
reduction
in
service
to
come
to
the
commission
and
say
these
are
the
reasons
that
i
can't
meet
the
production
level
that
i've
been
providing
and
i
want
a
reduction
in
service
under
section
4(d)
or
to
accomplish
a
partial
abandonment
under
section
7(b)
of
the
act.
mr.
charles
hill
well,
the
commission
repeatedly
refers
to
the
sunray
case
and
the
sun
oil
case
in
order
539(b)
and
actually
going
back
to
order
539
and
they
repeatedly
rely
upon
the
southland
case
in
their
brief
for
this
court.
so
they
seem
to
think
that
those
decisions
give
them
some
authority,
but
they
think
that
authority
allows
them
to
reach
out
and
grab
a
body
of
diverse
state
laws
and
use
that
as
the
federal
standard.
and
we
say
that
those
decisions
don't
authorize
that
and
that
there's
nothing
in
the
act
or
the
legislative
history,
which
would
authorize
that
sort
of
step
to
develop
a
federal
service
standard.
mr.
charles
hill
that's
right
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
clearly
so.
so
our
problem
with
–
mr.
charles
hill
well,
i
think
it's
found
in-between
the
two
and
i
think
it
becomes
clear
when
one
imagines
the
step
passed
sunray
and
southland.
shell
oil
has
argued
that
the
private
contract
between
the
pipeline
and
producer
contains
no
firm
delivery
obligation.
in
that
case,
one
can
imagine
the
next
step
in
the
sunray
or
southland
situation
where
the
producer
says
not
that
my
contract
is
come
to
an
end
and
therefore
i
want
to
stop
service,
but
that
my
contract
allows
me
to
supply
whatever
i
want
to
supply
at
my
discretion
and
for
that
reason
i
won't
even
go
to
the
commission
to
get
approval
under
4(d)
or
7(b)
for
that
reduction
in
service.
mr.
charles
hill
that
leaves
the
exclusion
of
the
operation
of
the
exclusion
in
essentially
the
same
place
that
it
is
with
respect
to
the
commission's
current
application
of
4(d)
or
7(b).
the
commission
currently
when
a
producer
comes
in
and
says
i
would
like
to
abandon
this
particular
field,
listens
to
it's
justification
and
decides
whether
or
not
that
abandonment
is
in
fact
justified
and
if
it
decides
that
the
abandonment
is
not
justified,
it
issues
an
order
that
says
no,
you
shall
continue
to
serve
the
interstate
market.
and
all
we
are
asking
for
and
all
we
think
the
act
requires
is
an
application
of
that
principle
to
the
situation
of
significant
declines
during
the
course
of
the
contract
and
during
the
course
of
a
certificate.
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
sunray
case
at
364
u.s.
156,
the
court
especially
refereed
to
section
4(d)
of
the
act
in
saying
that
its
decision
in
that
case
did
not
make
the
producer
a
captive
of
the
commission.
the
producer
always
had
the
opportunity
to
come
to
the
commission
and
ask
for
a
reduction
in
service
under
section
4(d)
of
the
act.
i
believe
that
there
is
a
third
reason
why
the
commission's
activity
here
has
run
a
file
of
natural
gas
act
and
that
is
what
the
commission
has
essentially
done
by
adopting
a
body
of
state
law
is
to
pull
the
service
obligation
out
from
under
a
firm
federal
standard
under
the
natural
gas
act.
the
commission
has
resisted
our
efforts
to
point
to
the
fpc
versus
texaco
case
in
this
regard,
what
we
think
that
the
commission
has
done
essentially
the
same
thing
in
a
service
area
here
that
it
attempted
to
do
there.
they
tried
to
pull
small
producer
rates
out
from
under
the
regulatory
scheme
of
the
act
and
leave
them
to
be
governed
by
free
market
decisions
of
the
small
producer
and
the
pipeline
involved.
here
what
the
commission
is
sought
to
do
is
to
pull
service
obligations
out
from
under
the
act
and
allow
those
service
obligations
to
be
governed
by
the
free
market
decision
between
the
lessor
and
lessee
and
as
this
court
indicated
in
texaco
that,
that
form
of
price
deregulation
was
not
authorized
by
the
act.
i
think
also
this
form
of
service
deregulation
is
not
authorized
by
the
act.
now
the
commission
does
not
contest
our
position
on
the
merits.
the
commission
does
not
claim
that
there
is
a
particular
provision
in
the
act
that
authorizes
this
effort
to
pick
up
a
body
of
state
law
and
have
that
be
the
delivery
obligation
under
the
act.
it
doesn't
point
to
anything
in
the
legislative
history
and
it
doesn't
really
point
to
anything
firm
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
which
would
seem
to
authorize
that
rather
unusual
effort
to
develop
a
federal
service
standard.
indeed,
there
a
number
of
decisions
this
court
which
have
found
very
heavily
upon
that
sort
of
patch
work
result
and
i
might
as
in
aside
point
out
that
at
page
17
of
our
reply
brief,
we
sight
to
a
report
which
lays
out
the
various
provisions
of
state
law
and
i
think
that
the
court
from
looking
at
that
commission
report
that
we
sighted
in
a
footnote
on
page
17
can
see
then
in
fact
state
laws
will
differ
widely
in
terms
of
their
obligations.
the
obligations
they
place
upon
the
producer
on
questions
of
allocation,
on
questions
of
pooling,
on
questions
of
space.
so
what
the
commission
really
is
doing
here
is
adopting
sort
of
a
patch
work
solution
of
the
federal
service
standard,
but
indicates
that
the
commission
does
not
point
anything
in
the
act
to
legislative
history
or
the
decisions
of
this
court,
which
would
seem
to
authorize
this
rather
unusual
step
in
developing
a
federal
service
standard.
rather
it
says
that
the
decision
of
the
commission
is
due
grade
deference
from
this
court.
our
first
response
of
that
is
that
whatever
standard
this
court
might
apply
this
standard;
this
effort
is
so
far
beyond
the
reaches
of
the
act
that
it
should
be
set
aside,
but
i
think
the
court
need
not
go
that
far
in
terms
of
applying
a
different
standard.
what
the
commission
has
said
here
is
that
it
is
interpreting
the
service
obligations
that
flow
from
section
7
of
the
act
and
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
fifth
circuit
fully
recognized
that
at
page
3(a)
and
4(a)
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
where
we
have
reprinted
the
court's
opinion.
it
is
apparent
that
the
court
realized
that
what
the
commission
was
doing
was
engaging
in
an
act
of
interpretation.
as
such,
under
the
past
opinions
of
this
court,
i
don't
believe
that,
that
effort
of
statutory
interpretation
is
due
grade
deference.
the
commission
was
not
here
exercising
the
sort
of
authority
that
it
has
under
section
5
of
the
act,
which
is
basically
a
legislatively
delegated
rule
making
function.
it
was
simply
engaging
the
statutory
of
interpretation.
thus
the
decision
of
this
court
last
term
in
national
citizen's
committee
for
broadcasting
versus
fcc,
i
think
is
in
apposite
as
are
the
other
opinions,
which
have
been
sighted
by
the
commission.
under
the
proper
standard
of
review,
no
undue
deference
is
required
here
and
in
fact,
seeing
this
as
an
effort
at
statutory
construction,
it
is
important
to
note
this
is
neither
a
consistent
or
a
long
standing
interpretation.
this
is
not
a
interpretation
that
people
have
relied
upon
as
was
the
case
in
natural
resources
defense
council
versus
train,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
several
years
ago
and
which
has
been
relied
upon
by
the
commission
nor
is
it
a
decision
that
draws
heavily
upon
a
great
deal
of
experience
from
the
commission,
because
as
mr.
shapiro
has
admitted
this
constitutes,
this
order
539(b)
constitutes
the
commission's
first
effort
at
interpreting
or
defining
the
service
standard,
which
flows
from
the
act.
and
as
such,
in
reaching
out
for
this
body
of
state
law,
the
commission
in
fact
justified
its
actions
simply
by
saying
that
it
was
doing
so,
because
the
producers
had
become
acquainted
with
it.
i
submit
that,
that
is
hardly
a
sound
basis
for
deference
on
the
part
of
this
court
to
a
decision
of
the
commission.
a
question
has
been
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
interpreting
the
service
obligation
on
the
act
may
pose
some
problems
of
retroactivity.
i
think
what
the
commission
should
have
done
here,
what
the
commission
says
it
did
was
to
interpret
those
obligations
and
as
in
the
sunray
case
where
again
the
commission
was
interpreting
a
certificate
obligation,
which
had
retroactive
effect.
that
statutory
interpretation;
that
defining
of
the
service
obligation
raises
no
retroactivity
problems.
in
addition,
as
long
as
the
commission
adopts
an
approach,
which
allows
the
producer
to
come
in
and
show
justification
for
declining
reserves
or
declining
deliveries,
then
i
think
further
there
is
no
problem
of
confiscation
or
unfairness
to
the
producer.
so,
in
summary,
we
submit
that
the
commission
has
acted
beyond
the
authority
granted
it
and
reaching
out
for
this
body
of
state
law
and
defining
it
as
the
federal
service
standard
that
it
is
position
here
deserves
no
grade
deference.
and
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
remand
this
action
back
to
the
commission
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
other
requirements
of
section
7
and
section
4
of
the
act.
thank
you.
