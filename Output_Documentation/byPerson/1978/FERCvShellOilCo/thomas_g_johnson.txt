mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
thomas
g.
johnson
representing
shell
oil
company
and
appearing
here
on
behalf
of
the
producer
respondents.
in
this
case,
the
court
is
again
asked
to
reexamine
the
distinction
between
production
and
gathering,
which
is
excluded
from
the
commission's
jurisdiction
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
sale
for
resale,
which
is
specifically
included.
for
some
20
years,
since
this
court's
decision
in
philips
this
distinction
was
thought
to
be
cleared
by
the
industry
and
by
the
commission.
and
to
read
what
the
court
said
in
philips
in
this
regard.
i
would
like
to
the
quote
the
following.
“in
fpc
versus
panhandle
eastern,
we
observed
that
the
natural
and
clear
meaning
of
the
phrase
“production
or
gathering
of
natural
gas”
is
that
it
encompasses
the
producing
properties
and
gathering
facilities
of
the
natural
gas
company.
similarly,
in
colorado
interstate
versus
fpc,
we
stated
the
transportation
in
sale
does
not
include
production
and
gathering
and
indicated
that
the
production
and
gathering
exemption
applies
to
the
physical
activities,
facilitates
and
properties
used
in
the
production
and
gathering
of
natural
gas.
in
the
philips
case,
the
producer
had
argued
that
he
was
in
the
business
of
producing
and
gathering
natural
gas
and
that
sale
for
resale
was
incidental
to
that
business.
and
therefore
was
not
subject
to
commission
jurisdiction.
the
commission
so
found,
but
this
court
disagreed
and
said
that
there
was
distinction
between
the
physical
activity,
which
the
producer
was
engaged
in
and
was
excluded
from
the
commission's
jurisdiction
and
the
sale
for
resale
which
was
covered
by
commission
jurisdiction.
in
this
case,
the
commission
makes
exactly
the
opposite
argument.
they
argue
that
production
is
incidental
to
the
sale
and
therefore
the
commission
must
regulate
production
in
order
to
assure
that
the
sale
will
continue.
that
argument
should
be
rejected
for
the
same
reason
that
the
producers'
argument
in
philips
was
rejected
and
that
reason
is
that
it
destroys
the
clear
distinction
imposed
by
congress
between
production
and
gathering
and
sale
for
resale.
the
only
other
case
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
distinction
between
production
and
gathering
and
sale
is
ugi
versus
continental
oil
company,
rayne
field
case.
and
there
again,
the
court
reiterated
this
distinction
in
this
language,
“we
conclude
that
even
though
a
sale
of
natural
gas
and
interstate
commerce
occurs
before
production
or
gathering
is
ended,
it
is
nonetheless
subject
to
regulation
and
the
context
to
such
a
sale
as
distinguished
from
the
situation
on
fpc
versus
panhandle
eastern
pipe
line
company
to
be
discussed
hereafter.
the
production
or
gathering
exemption
relates
to
the
physical
activities,
process
and
facilities
of
production
or
gathering,
but
not
to
sales
of
the
kind
that
are
primarily
subject
to
commission
jurisdiction.
this
accommodation
of
the
two
relevant
clauses
of
section
1(b)
gives
content
to
the
national
objectives
of
the
natural
gas
act
as
expounded
in
philips
and
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
to
accomplish
them,
while
in
no
way
interfering
with
the
state
regulatory
power
over
the
physical
processes
of
production
or
gathering
in
furtherance
of
conservation
or
other
legitimate
state
concerns.
we
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
reason
why
the
commission
had
never
sought
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
production
activities
prior
to
this
case
was
that
those
activities
were
actively
being
regulated
by
the
states.
this
was
the
case
even
before
the
natural
gas
act
was
passed
in
1938.
as
early
as
1931,
this
court
and
champlin
refining
company
versus
corporation
commission
affirmed
the
power
of
the
states
to
regulate
production
activities.
this
palaces
this
distinction
under
another
line
of
cases
by
this
court
led
by
panhandle
eastern
versus
public
service
commission,
which
held
that
the
congress
in
passing
the
natural
gas
act
intended
to
fill
the
regulatory
gap,
which
this
court
had
held
in
the
attleboro
and
missouri
versus
kansas
gas
cases,
the
states
had
no
power
to
regulate.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes
sir,
they
are
your
honor
and
we
don't
believe
there
is
any
gap
in
regulation.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
we
believe
your
honor
that
the
states
are
regulating
the
production
activities.
as
i
understand
that
was
the
distinction
that
the
court
made
in
the
philips
and
rayne
field
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
no,
i
think
that
-
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
no
sir,
i
think
the
states
were
doing
that.
yes
sir
that
is
my
point.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
we
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
answering
that
question.
we
don't
think
they
should
have.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
the
commission
argument
that
regulation
-
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor,
we
believe
that
this
whole
proceeding
as
a
result
of
erroneous
assumption
on
part
of
the
commission
on
the
consumer
advocates
that
producers
will
not
produce
their
gas
unless
the
commission
makes
them
do
it.
we
believe
that
there
argument
defies
reason,
because
the
only
source
of
the
income
that
a
producer
has
is
the
gas
which
he
produces.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor
that
argument.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor
that
argument
was
made
before
the
commission
in
the
court
of
appeals
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
in
november
of
last
year.
i
do
not
believe
it
is
any
longer
possible,
because
the
natural
gas
policy
act
fixes
a
sealing
price
for
intrastate
sales
as
well
as
interstate
sales.
so,
if
there
ever
was
any
incentive
on
the
part
of
a
producer
to
withhold
gas
to
receive
a
higher
price
that
was
removed
but
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
now
the
consumers
make
the
argument
there
are
different
categories
of
gas
under
that
act
and
that
the
producers
may
somehow
adjust
gas
between
those
categories.
we
submit
that's
not
true,
we
think
congress
went
to
great
lengths
to
avoid
that
very
thing
and
they
provided
as
nearly
as
they
could
that
producers
must
continue
to
produce
gas
from
existing
fields,
from
existing
wells
and
they
can't
get
any
higher
price
for
it.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
that's
right
and
what
i'm
saying
is
-
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
no
sir.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor
the
problem
with
that
theory
is
that
once
a
producer
has
dedicated
his
gas
to
interstate
commerce,
he
must
continue
to
deliver
that
gas
in
the
interstate
commerce;
we
don't
contest
that
and
the
problem
-
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor
this
court
held
in
sunray
and
we
don't
challenge
that
once
the
gas
from
a
particular
field
is
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce
through
a
contract
and
a
certificate,
the
producer
can't
remove
that
gas.
he
can't
drill
another
well
on
that
same
field
on
that
same
lease
and
sell
it
anywhere
else.
he
has
to
sell
it
to
the
interstate
purchaser
that's
what
the
law
says.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes,
but
the
commission
and
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor,
i
believe
the
commission's
practices
have
been
consistent
over
the
last
15
years
of
universally
denying
abandonment
in
any
situation
where
the
wells
will
continue
to
produce.
so,
i
don't
think
it's
a
practical
answer
to
say
that
the
commission
would
grant
abandonment
and
allow
the
producer
to
sell
somewhere
else.
it
is
practical
matter,
they
don't
do
that.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
our
real
objection
your
honor
is
that
the
commission
is
seeking
on
this
proceeding
to
second
gas,
the
production
decisions
of
the
producers
and
they
come
about
in
this
way.
keep
in
mind
that
a
gas
field
is
continually
declining
in
production
and
that's
the
problem
with
the
standard
which
says
that
a
producer
must
maintain
service,
because
that's
usually
physically
impossible
for
the
producer
to
do
because
the
gas
field
is
continually
declining
and
the
ability
of
the
wells
to
produce
is
continually
being
reduced.
now
the
question
is
whether
the
producer
can
do
something
at
some
point
in
time
to
delay
that
decline
or
differ
the
loss
of
production
from
these
wells
and
those
are
very
difficult
questions.
the
question
usually
comes
out
if
a
well
loses
production,
can
that
production
be
restored
by
drilling
a
new
well
or
can
it
be
restored
by
installing
pumping
facilities
to
remove
the
waters,
which
is
encroached
and
chocked
off
the
gas
or
can
explosives
are
acid
be
used
to
increase
the
permeability
of
the
wells.
all
of
these
things
are
decisions
requiring
expert
judgments.
now,
we
think
if
the
effect
of
this
decision
is
that
the
commission
supervises
all
of
those
production
decisions
that
the
producers
will
be
embroiled
in
litigation
before
the
commission
repeatedly
in
an
attempt
to
justify
their
production
decisions
and
we
think
that's
gong
to
detract
from
the
search
for
new
gas
supply,
which
is
the
only
way
that
the
gas
supply
can
really
be
increased.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
i
would
answer
that
in
two
ways
your
honor.
i
think
the
commission
is
caught
in
a
dichotomy.
they
say
on
the
one
hand
that
there
is
a
gap
in
a
regulation.
and
yet
they
say
that
the
state
regulation
is
adequate
over
production
facilities
and
we
certainly
do
not
contest
that
once
the
gas
is
produced
we
must
continue
to
deliver
to
the
interstate
purchaser.
so,
if
that
is
the
commission's
position
then
there
is
certainly
no
regulatory
gap.
if
the
commission's
position
on
the
other
hand
is
that
there
is
a
regulatory
gap
then
they
must
be
saying
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
state
regulation
over
production
activity
and
we
intend
to
change
it,
we
don't
know
what
those
changes
will
consist
of.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes
your
honor,
we
believe
it's
unnecessary
and
we
believe
it
conflicts
with
the
intent
of
congress
when
they
enacted
the
natural
gas
act,
because
we
think
that
congress
intended
to
leave
that
regulation
over
production
activities
to
the
states.
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
more
the
producer
can
be
required
to
do
then
what
he
is
required
to
do
under
the
state
standards,
which
is
to
operate
with
due
diligence
and
as
a
reasonably
prudent
operator
under
the
circumstances
of
case.
he
certainly
can't
be
required
to
maintain
service
from
the
gas
field
where
the
gas
is
already
been
produced.
so,
the
simple
explanation,
which
the
consumer
advocate
proposes
isn't
impractical
one,
because
if
the
field
will
no
longer
maintain
service,
the
question
the
commission
or
any
regulatory
body
has
to
answer
is
why.
and
if
the
reason
why
is
that
the
gas
is
depleted
then
there
is
nothing
the
producer
or
anybody
else
can
do
about
it.
it's
only
if
the
producer
has
been
negligent
or
has
not
operated
his
lease
properly
that
the
regulatory
body
takes
some
action.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor
i'll
answer
the
question
this
way.
first
of
all,
we
think
that
example
is
completely
contrary
to
reason.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
for
a
producer
to
spend
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
drilling
a
gas
well
and
then
refused
to
spend
the
few
dollars
necessary
to
maintain
that
well
if
his
only
source
of
incoming
is
coming
from
that
well.
now,
we
think
that
dividing
line
is
this
-
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
we
think
what
-
let
me
say
what
i
think
the
commission
can
do
and
what
i
think
they
can't
do.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
to
avoid
the
question.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
we
believe
that
the
commission
does
not
have
regulatory
jurisdiction
to
require
the
producer
to
make
additional
capital
investments.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
i
think
they
would
your
honor,
because
the
court
of
appeals
below
said
this.
they
said
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
require
producers
to
continue
deliveries
where
the
wells
are
capable
of
producing
and
paying
quantities.
now
if
the
wells
are
capable
of
producing
and
paying
quantities
even
given
some
minor
maintenance
operation,
we
believe
that
the
commission
could
require
that,
that
be
done.
now,
what
we
don't
believe
however,
is
that
the
commission
can
require
new
wells
to
be
drilled
or
the
capital
expenditures
can
-
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor
that's
what
they
said
in
their
order.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes
sir
that's
what
order
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes,
what
the
commission
said
was
that
if
we
find
it
necessary
to
maintain
the
service,
we
are
going
to
require
producers
to
drill
new
wells
or
take
whatever
measures
we
find
that
is
necessary
to
maintain
this
service.
that
is
what
the
commission's
order
539(b)
said.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
are
arguing
that
they
have
the
power
under
the
order
they
intend
to
exercise
that
power
at
some
point
in
time.
they
very
carefully
avoided
any
discussion
of
how
this
jurisdiction
will
be
exercised.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
i
think
that's
right
your
honor.
but
our
point
is
that
in
discussing
whether
or
not
have
they
power,
the
court
should
consider
how
this
power
should
be
exercised,
is
going
to
be
exercised
and
if
it
is
going
to
be
exercised
in
a
way
that
interferes
with
the
state
jurisdiction
over
production
activates,
then
we
think
it
conflicts
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
and
exceeds
the
commission
jurisdictions.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor,
i
think
our
position
is
that
the
commission
has
no
power
to
control
the
production
and
gathering
activity.
now,
i
understood
justice
stevens
question
to
be
limited
to
a
fact
situation
where
it
would
simply
be
a
matter
of
turning
the
valves
back
on
or
to
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor,
i
would
be
very
content
if
this
court
would
hold
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor
i
think
i
was
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
court
of
appeals
says
it.
that
if
the
well
is
capable
of
producing
in
paying
quantities
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
make
those
wells
to
require
the
producer
to
deliver
the
gas.
in
other
words
that
the
producer
just
turns
the
valve.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
gets
over
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
i
certainly
think
if
the
commission
requires
anything
affirmative
on
the
part
of
the
producer
to
produce
the
wells
that
it
is
production
and
gathering
and
would
be
excluded
from
their
jurisdiction.
i
think
the
difference
in
the
dividing
line
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
if
something
more
is
required
then
simply
turning
a
valve
or
whether
the
commission
is
seeking
to
require
the
producer
to
actually
in
someway
control
its
production
operations
and
we
believe
that
is
what
is
excluded
from
commission
jurisdiction.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
yes
your
honor,
the
contracts
obligate
the
producer
to
deliver
all
of
the
gas
from
which
is
produced
and
that's
important,
which
is
produced
from
a
certain
field.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
if
the
contract
did
require
that
the
producer
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
normally,
they
do
not
your
honor,
because
the
production
decisions
in
the
contracts
are
normally
reserved
to
the
producer
and
the
pipeline
is
not
the
body
that
polices
the
producer's
actions
in
those
matters.
it
is
the
state
agencies
and
the
lessors
in
the
state
proceedings,
which
assure
that
the
producer
will
proceed
diligently.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
your
honor.
first
as
i
said
before,
i
think
that's
not
a
realistic
--
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
but
assuming
that
the
pipeline
did
have
that
–
that
was
the
situation,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
contract
gave
the
pipeline
that
power
or
whether
the
contract
simply
said
that
the
pipeline
had
the
right
to
buy
the
gas
if
as
and
when
produced
as
many
of
them
do.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
the
royalty
owner
would
certainly
vigorously
prosecute
the
producer.
mr.
thomas
g.
johnson
there
is
not
any
question
about
that
your
honor.
your
honor,
if
i
could
close
with
just
one
sentence.
we
believe
that
the
commission
is
seeking
to
assert
jurisdiction
in
an
area
which
is
precluded
from
asserting
by
congress
and
we
think
the
court
of
appeal
should
differ.
