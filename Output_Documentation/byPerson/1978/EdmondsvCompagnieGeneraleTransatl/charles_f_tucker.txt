mr.
charles
f.
tucker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
the
court
for
determination,
it
seems
to
me
is
one
of
fairness
inequity
and
as
well
or
not
a
shipowner
which
has
been
found
by
jury
to
the
only
20%
at
fault
for
an
accident
shall
be
required
to
pay
full
damages
to
the
plaintiff
while
the
stevedore
employer
found
to
be
70%
at
fault
recovers
the
full
amount
of
its
compensation
lien
and
thus
shares
none
of
the
financial
burden
of
the
loss.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
or
consider
what
the
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
adopting
the
1972
amendments
to
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
it's
clear
that
they
acted
in
order
to
correct
the
number
of
inequities
which
i
developed
over
the
years.
primarily
of
course,
it
was
to
provide
a
liberal
system
of
compensation
for
longshoreman,
the
injured
parties.
but
secondarily,
it
was
certainly
to
more
equally
distribute
the
financial
burden
occasioned
by
an
accident
among
the
three
parties
involved,
the
longshoreman
himself,
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedore.
and
i
think
here,
it's
important
to
recognize
what
had
happened
under
litigation
which
had
developed
under
the
longshoreman's
act.
and
mr.
breit
has
referred
to
the
sieracki
case
and
the
ryan
case.
and
it
had
developed
as
you
know
that
longshoreman
were
given
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
and
could
recover
against
the
vessel
owner
not
only
for
negligence
but
for
unseaworthiness
which
in
effect
almost
made
the
shipowner
an
insurer
for
the
safety
of
the
longshoreman.
in
order
to
correct
this
inequity
or
in
an
attempt
to
the
ryan
doctrine
allowed
the
shipowner
to
claim
back
over
against
the
stevedoring
company
for
indemnity
and
the
stevedore
ended
up
in
that
type
of
three-party
litigation
by
not
only
paying
compensation
but
by
paying
full
damages
assessed
by
jury
or
the
court.
this
was
recognized
by
everyone
as
being
quite
inequitable.
if
you
adopt
the
position
of
the
plaintiff
petitioner
in
this
case,
we
are
going
right
back
to
the
same
old
inequity
except
it
now
falls
on
the
shipowner
instead
of
on
the
stevedoring
company
and
i
don't
believe
as
judge
haynsworth
stated
in
his
opinion
that
it
was
ever
the
intent
of
the
congress
while
taking
away
on
the
one
hand
the
right
of
the
shipowner
to
recover
any
indemnity
from
the
stevedoring
company
to
then
settle
the
shipowner
with
full
liability
for
an
accident
when
it
may
well
have
been
only
slightly
at
fault
and
the
stevedoring
company
greatly
at
fault.
this
was
not
the
intent
of
the
congress
as
shown
by
the
legislative
history
and
could
not
have
been
we
contend
in
light
of
the
historical
background
of
the
19
--
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
as
existed
prior
to
1972.
now,
there
was
also
one
other
intention
of
the
congress
i
believe
in
the
1972
amendments
and
that
was
to
provide
a
liberal
compensation
scheme
whereby
the
longshoreman
could
look
to
the
act
to
compensation
for
full
satisfaction
for
his
injuries
and
would
not
have
to
file
a
third
party
action
against
anyone
except
on
unusual
circumstances
in
order
to
recover
compensation.
the
result
as
suggested
by
the
petitioner
would
do
away
with
this
intention
of
the
congress.
now,
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit,
the
en
banc
decision
serves
to
further
the
proxies
of
the
amendments
by
balancing
the
equities
among
the
three
parties.
as
this
decision
has
indicated,
the
shipowner
will
pay
its
proportionate
fault.
in
this
case,
the
jury
found
there
were
20%
at
fault
for
the
accident.
the
longshoreman
recovers
not
only
his
statutory
benefits
under
the
act
which
this
case
serves
to
show
a
quite
liberal.
he's
already
received
in
excess
of
$50,000.00
in
compensation
payments.
but
in
addition,
he
will
recover
the
20%
liability
damages
which
the
jury
has
said
are
attributable
to
the
shipowner.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
yes,
sir.
well,
he
was
found
to
be
10%
at
fault
and
i
don't
think
anyone
contends
that.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
it
would
be
reduced.
the
total
adjustment
was
$100,000.00
it
would
be
reduced
to
$90,000.00.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
but
the
shipowner's
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
no.
no,
sir,
the
shipowner's
liability
is
20%
of
the
whole,
20%
of
$100,000.00.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
$20,000.00.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
reduction
is
in
the
total
award.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
which
would
mean
$90,000.00.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
the
longshoreman
received
compensation
from
his
employer.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
correct.
no,
the
employer
is
statutorily
immuned
from
liability.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i'll
certainly
try.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
the
judge
propounded
interrogatories
to
the
jury.
he
first
asked
them,
was
there
any
fault,
was
any
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner,
and
if
so
in
what
percentage?
the
jury
said,
20%.
he
then
said,
was
the
stevedoring
company
negligent
in
any
way,
and
if
so,
in
what
percentage?
and
they
answered,
70%.
and
he
then
said,
is
the
plaintiff
himself
negligent
in
any
respect
and
if
so,
in
what
percentage?
and
they
answered
10%
and
then
they
answered
in
total
damages
$100,000.
the
judge,
the
district
judge
entered
judgment
reluctantly
for
$90,000.00
and
it
then
went
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit
reversed.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
no,
sir.
the
stevedore
--
let's
assume
the
judgment
are
reinstated.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
well,
they
would
recover
that
back.
the
shipowner
would
pay
$90,000.00
to
the
plaintiff
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
the
plaintiff
would
be
required
to
pay
back
$50,000.00.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
no,
i'm
sorry.
that's
not
correct.
the
net
payment
rather
shipowner
would
be
$90,000.00.
i'm
sorry.
you
see
the
shipowner
pays
the
total
$90,000.00
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
--
out
of
that
judgment,
the
plaintiff
is
required
to
reimburse
the
stevedoring
company
for
what
it
has
paid.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
yes,
that's
exactly
right.
and
that
is
our
point,
your
honor
that
it
is
certainly
most
inequitable
for
the
stevedoring
company
which
is
the
party
in
this
case
most
at
fault
which
will
come
home
free.
they
will
not
pay
money.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
the
difference
here
mr.
justice
is
that
this
people,
the
stevedore
and
the
shipowner
are
not
joint
tortfeasors.
they
are
not
joint,
they
are
not
jointly
liable.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
right.
but
there
is,
the
party
your
honor
that
does
pay
the
entire
amount
is
not
restricted
in
any
matter
from
recovering
over
if
he
can
from
one
of
the
other
parties.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
that
is
correct
sir
except
and
i
would
get
to
this.
we
feel
that
the
case
law
as
it
has
developed
in
this
court
has
now
modified
that
rule
and
we
feel
it
no
longer
applies
in
this
situation.
we
think
that
in
all
fairness
and
equity,
which
we
believe
the
court
has
tried
to
do
in
many
of
its
decisions,
that
affect
this
such
as
the
cooper
stevedoring
in
reliable
transfer,
certainly
indicate
that
proportionate
fault
is
what
we
should
be
aiming
for
and
this
is
just
the
next
step
in
this
type
of
litigation
which
will
take
the
burden
and
apportion
it
among
the
parties
involved.
that,
and
just
to
finish
up
that
statement
as
to
how
it
would
be
apportioned,
the
shipowner
would
pay
its
proportionate
shares
now
by
the
jury.
the
longshoreman
receives
his
compensation
which
in
this
case,
exceeds
$50,000.00
to
date
and
he
is
still
receiving
it
by
the
way
plus
he
will
still
use
the
20%
from
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedoring
company
never
pays,
never
pays
more
than
its
statutory
obligation
under
the
act
and
is
protected
by
the
act
from
any
claim
of
indemnity
by
the
shipowner.
now,
to
me
that
is
the
fairest
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
alright,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
the
shipowner
would
pay
$20,000.00,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
to
the
longshoreman.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
he
has
already
the
$50,000.00
and
he
is
continuing
as
i
understand
it
to
receive.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
he
will
be
paying
his
statutory
obligation
under
the
longshoreman's
act.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
well,
that
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
left
the
district
court
and
did
not
meet
that.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
two
possible
ways
that
that
could
be
handled
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
get
into
it.
they
suggested
that
that
should
be
handled
on
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
it
is
an
interesting
question
and
that
has
been
discussed
in
our
briefs
and
in
particular
in
the
brief
of
mr.
coleman
in
the
amicus
brief.
there
are
two
approaches
to
that,
and
if
you
would
like,
i'll
be
happy
to
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
it
was
not
specifically
covered
your
honor,
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
right.
the
stevedoring
company
pays
its
statutory
obligation.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
under
the
district
court,
yes,
sir.
correct.
they
would
get
it
back
from
the
judgment
paid
by
the
shipowner.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
it
certainly
is.
yes,
sir.
it's
quite
important.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
it
is
not
and
i
do
think
it
certainly
is
a
(inaudible).
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
well,
there
is,
under
the
present
law
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
district
court's
decision,
the
shipowner
pays
the
full
judgment
of
$90,000.00.
under
existing
law
the
stevedore
has
a
land,
equitable
land
to
recover
all
of
the
money
that
it
has
paid
to
that
longshoreman.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
well,
we
say
it
is
in
this
situation
your
honor
when
the
court
--
but
you
see
what
has
happened
on
the
other
cases
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i
don't
think
there's
a
difference
of
opinion
under
the
existing
law.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i
think
the
stevedoring
company
always
receives
its
full
compensation.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
well,
that's
--
that
is
what
the
fourth
circuit
left
to
the
district
court
and
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
no,
the
question
though
was
under
the
existing
law,
without
regard
to
the
percentages
of
proportionate
fault.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
as
it
stands,
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
well,
what
in
our
briefs,
we
have
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
well,
at
the
moment,
he
does
under
the
proportionate
fault
argument
where
a
court
has
asked
the
jury
to
apportion
the
fault
between
the
parties
--
among
the
parties.
then
our
contention
is
the
shipowner
is
responsible
only
for
its
proportionate
fault.
the
question
of
how
much
of
the
damage
is
paid
to
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
at
--
well,
i
may
have
misunderstood
his
question.
i
assumed
he
meant
as
the
law
exists
prior
to
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
in
this
case
and
it
is
true
and
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
however
under
the
proportionate
fault
argument.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
well,
the
district
court
has
stayed,
it
has
not
acted.
and
we
--
your
honor,
what
we
have
stated
here
is
that
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
it.
one,
if
under
what
we
contend
is
an
equitable
credit
if
the
percentage
of
fault
of
the
stevedoring
company
reduces
the
plaintiffs
judgment
by
more
than
the
amount
of
the
recovery
then
they
receive
nothing
back
on
their
lien.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
well
i
don't
think
that
that
would
necessarily
be
an
issue
if
the
court
decide
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
it
is
possible
but
i
don't
see
that
it
would
be
an
issue
for
this
court
because
it
would
have
decided
the
basic
issue
of
proportionate
fault
and
leaving
up
to
the
district
court's
the
method
of
handling
the
repayment
of
the
compensation
lien.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
alright,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
but
the
difference
is
that
the
shipowner
was
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
yes,
sir.
if
--
but
the
difference
is
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
well,
it
is
certainly
right
that
under
the
status
of
the
law,
he
is
out
to
$25,000.00.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
it
never,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
but
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
not
the
shipowner
pays
his
proportion
of
the
total
damages.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
they
stated
or
pay
is
his
statutory
damages.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
the
two
had
it
together
of
what
the
plaintiff
receives.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
even
though
he
suffered
more
damages
and
there
are
cases
where
he
will
get
less
but
that
is
reflective
of
the
compensation
seen
whereby
he
recovers
compensation
without
the
necessity
of
proving
any
fault.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
no,
because
i
don't
think
we
are
dealing
with
joint
tortfeasors
in
this
situation.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i
don't
think
so.
the
tortfeasor,
the
shipowner
in
this
instance
has
been
found
to
be
25%
at
fault
or
20%
in
our
case.
he
is
paying
damages
proportionate
to
his
fault.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
but
that
is
only
in
the
situation
where
you're
dealing
with
one
or
more
--
you've
got
to
have
another
tortfeasor
in
order
to
have
proportionate
fault.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
he
is
where
you
have
two
possible
tortfeasors
liable
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i
understand
that.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
not
two
joint
tortfeasors
in
the
sense
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
but
one
is
not
liable
to
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
3%
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
one
is
not
liable;
the
stevedoring
company
is
not
liable.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
he
violated
a
duty--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
but
not
liable
to
the
plaintiff
and
as
i
understand
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
it's
rule.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
but
the
rule
does
not.
the
rule
only
applies
where
you
have
two
or
more
persons
jointly
and
severally
liable
to
the
plaintiff
and
we
do
not
have
that
situation.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
well,
a
tort
as
i
understand
it
is
along
and
i
think
in
that
context
that
it
would
be
recognized.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
you
do?
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
well,
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
speak
for
a
moment
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
proportionate
fault
because
i
feel
that
that
and
along
with
the
fairness
and
equitable
argument
in
this
case
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
fourth
circuit
decided
this
case.
the
legislative
history
contrary
to
what
counsel
for
petition
acclaimed
clearly
states
that
the
vessel
shall
not
be
liable
in
damages
for
the
acts
or
omissions
of
the
stevedore.
they
said
it
on
page
4703
of
the
congressional
reports
“a
vessel
shall
not
be
liable
in
damages
for
acts
or
omissions
of
stevedores.”
it
could
not
be
clearer.
this
court
has
stated
in
recent
decisions
in
the
fourth
circuit
is
now
in
accord
with
the
doctrine
of
comparative
fault.
the
cooper
stevedoring
case
permitted
contribution
among
joint
tortfeasors
in
a
situation,
the
admiralty
situation
and
in
non-collision
cases
which
was
done
in
order
to
correct
the
inequity
of
one
bearing
the
entire
loss
though
the
other
may
have
been
equally
or
more
to
blame.
so
they
all
rule
against
no
contribution
in
non-collision
cases
was
changed
by
this
court.
in
reliable
transfer,
in
collision
cases,
the
all
rule
of
equally
divided
damages
was
changed
to
one
requiring
allocation
in
proportion
to
fault.
and
this
court
said
that
this
standard
should
be
adopted
allocating
liability
according
to
fault
where
other
possible.
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
fourth
circuit
has
done
and
which
we
contend
is
the
fairest
and
most
equitable
rule
for
this
court
to
adopt.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
yes,
sir.
clearly
it
was
intended
to
recognize
the
special
situation
where
the
longshoreman
is
employed
by
the
vessel
to
run
the
stevedoring
or
ship
repair
services.
but
we
contend
that
that
was
not
the
only
reason
for
placement
in
there.
that
it
was
placed
in
there
to
emphasize
what
seem
to
be
clear
in
the
congressional
intent
that
the
shipowner
should
not
be
liable
or
for
the
act
or
missions
of
the
stevedore
and
it
says
that
quite
clearly
as
i
recall
the
senate's
involved
if
such
person
was
employed
by
the
vessel
to
provide
stevedoring
services.
no
such
action
shall
be
permitted
if
the
injury
was
cause
by
the
negligence
of
persons
engaged
in
providing
stevedoring
services
to
the
vessel.
it
seems
perfectly
clear.
we
in
our
brief,
we
have
commented
on
the
fact
that
two
sentences
the
first
sentence
and
the
second
and
the
third
if
you
read
them
literally
cannot
possibly
mean
what
they
seem
to
say.
because
if
you
read
them
literally,
it
would
indicate
that
if
the
longshoreman
is
employed
by
independent
contractor
to
provide
stevedoring
services
and
if
there
is
any
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
of
the
vessel
owner
then
he
recovers
a
100%
whereas
if
you
read
the
second
and
third
sentences
that
way,
you
find
that
if
he's
employed
by
the
shipowner
to
run
the
stevedoring
services
in
any
fault
of
the
stevedoring
--
people
providing
stevedoring
services
cause
the
accident
he
recovers
nothing
and
i
don't
think
that
anyone
could
contend
that
the
congress
intended
to
do
that
and
the
only
way
to
reconcile
the
two
sentences
is
to
read
them
to
mean
to
the
extent
the
injury
was
caused
by
the
fault
of
the
vessel
or
the
fault
of
the
stevedoring
people
employed
to
render
stevedoring
services
and
if
you
read
it
that
way,
it
is
entirely
consistent
and
also
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
act
in
the
legislative
history
which
indicates
that
they
shall
not
be
responsible
for
acts
or
omission
of
the
stevedore.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
well,
he's
not
required
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i
assume
he
may.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
he
cannot
sue
the
shipowner
for
unseaworthiness
because
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
ever
come
up
if
he
took
it
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
if
he
took
himself
out
of
the
act
and
said
i'm
no
longer
covered
then
he
could
do
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
if
the
act
does
not
apply
and
you're
looking
for
common
law
action
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i
was
trying
to
answer
it
in
a
hypothetical
sense
but
i
don't
think
he
can
decide
where
the
act
applies.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i
understood
you
to
say
that.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i
took
it
to
be
a
hypothetical
question
in
that
way.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
it
doesn't
give
him
the
option
if
he
has
paid
compensation
benefits.
he
has
no
--
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
i
assume
he
have
an
option.
mr.
charles
f.
tucker
he
can
sue
the
act
--
the
ship
under
the
act
for
negligence,
yes,
sir.
