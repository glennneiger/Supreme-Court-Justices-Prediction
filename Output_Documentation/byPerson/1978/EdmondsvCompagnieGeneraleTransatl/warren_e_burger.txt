arguments
next

mr.

i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.

i
don't
know
whether

the
white

e.
burger
are
we
going
to
be
able
to
know
the
whole
story
of
this
allocation
until
the
district
court
acts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
someone
might
want
to
be
back
here
again
after
the
district
court
acts,
isn't
that
possible?
someone,
i'm
not
sure
which
one
of
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
necessarily
but
it's
possible
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
breit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
have
to
say
about
whether
this
case
might
be
back
here
could
conceivably
be
back
here
after
the
district
court
acts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
