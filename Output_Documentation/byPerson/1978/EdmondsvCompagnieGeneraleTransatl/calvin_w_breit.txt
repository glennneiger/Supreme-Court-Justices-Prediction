mr.
calvin
w.
breit
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
on
out
of
the
fourth
circuit
arising
out
of
a
decision
which
was
then
in
conflict
with
the
ninth
and
now
with
the
second
and
fifth
circuits
as
well
concerning
the
rights
of
a
longshoreman
who
was
injured
aboard
the
defendant's
vessel
as
a
result
of
the
combined
negligence
of
the
longshoreman
himself,
the
stevedore,
and
the
shipowner.
the
major
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
longshoreman
has
a
right
to
recover
in
full
his
damages
under
the
longest
established
common
law
principal
of
joint
and
several
liability
from
the
various
tortfeasors
who
caused
his
harm
or
whether
that
right
has
been
abrogated
by
statute
under
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
the
history
of
the
right
in
both
maritime
and
land-based
law
is
extensive.
this
court
has
ruled
in
halcyon
versus
haenn.
it
is
ruled
in
pope
and
talbot
versus
hawn.
it
is
more
recently
ruled
in
cooper
versus
fritz
kopke.
in
acl
versus
uri
(ph),
numerous
other
cases
that
the
injured
party
has
an
indivisible
right
of
recovery
in
full.
the
question
now
posed
is
whether
congress
intended
to
abrogate
that
rule
when
it
amended
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act
in
1972.
prior
to
1972,
it
was
clear
that
halcyon
and
versus
haenn,
pope
and
talbot
versus
hawn,
was
the
law
on
that
particular
issue.
congress
made
no
act
which
would
suggest
that
it
intended
to
change
that
law.
there
is
apparent
but
not
actual
discrepancy
between
two
sentences
in
905
(d)
of
the
act
which
has
been
taken
to
suggest
that
the
congress
was
intending
proportionate
fall.
nothing
could
have
been
further
from
congress'
mind
at
the
time.
respondent
in
page
11
of
his
brief
concedes
that
the
purpose
of
the
second
sentence
of
905
(b)
was
intended
to
preserve
the
doctrine
established
by
this
court
in
reed
versus
yaka
namely
that
a
shipowner
could
not
by
hiring
his
own
longshoreman
and
thus
become
the
stevedore
avoid
the
harm
that
he
does
of
that
stevedore.
it
was
in
the
context
of
reed
versus
yaka
that
the
second
sentence
was
passed
in
the
1972
amendment
and
the
purpose
of
it
was
solely
to
retain
the
doctrine
as
espoused
by
this
court
in
reed
versus
yaka.
on
page
43
and
44
of
respondent's
brief,
it
is
suggested
that
933
of
this
same
act
was
passed
so
that
the
longshoreman
could
not
effect
a
double
recovery
and
received
double
compensation.
well,
it's
inconceivable
that
he
could
have
received
double
compensation
unless
in
the
first
instance,
he
is
compensated
in
full
by
the
shipowner
tortfeasor
who
has
caused
his
harm.
an
appellee
in
the
second
circuit,
anderson
versus
iceland
on
the
first
both
have
stated
that
the
purpose
of
that
sentence
in
905
(b)
was
to
preserve
the
doctrine
of
reed
versus
yaka.
but
more
important
than
that
congress
itself
was
not
silent
on
the
point.
congress
specifically
stated
that
the
longshoreman's
right
of
action
in
negligence
against
the
shipowner
shall
survive.
now,
that
right
of
action
against
the
shipowner
is
the
right
to
recover
100%
of
his
damages
from
the
shipowner
or
any
other
person
who
independently
or
concurrently
created
the
harm
that
he
has
suffered.
the
congressional
record
is
replete
of
literally
dozens
of
cases
that
it
intended
to
overrule
that
were
in
existence
at
the
time.
this
court
in
an
active
role
which
it
is
permitted
to
do
in
matters
of
maritime
under
the
doctrine
of
seas
shipping
versus
sieracki
provided
for
the
longshoreman
a
cause
of
action
which
created
in
effect
an
absolute
right
of
recovery
for
any
unseaworthy
condition
regardless
of
fault.
interestingly
enough,
the
seaworthy
condition,
the
unseaworthy
condition
was
almost
always
cause
by
the
negligence
of
the
stevedore.
the
court
had
held
in
halcyon
versus
haenn
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action
over
against
the
stevedore
for
contribution
in
tort.
and
this
court
then
went
on
to
extend
the
seas
doctrine
under
a
contract
theory
when
in
ryan
it
held
that
there
is
not
contribution
but
indemnity.
the
congress
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
on
those
issues
and
in
doing
so
in
its
reports,
it
clearly
established
when
it
was
intending
to
do.
it
set
forth
specifically
the
names
of
the
cases
that
it
intended
to
overrule
particularly
under
the
section
of
elimination
of
unseaworthiness
remedy
it
cites
sea
shipping
versus
sieracki
as
one
of
the
cases.
it
intended
to
overrule.
no
longer
does
the
longshoreman
have
a
cause
of
action
merely
because
he
was
injured
and
merely
because
there
was
a
defective
condition.
he
now
is
reduced
to
the
common
law
negligence
action
instead
of
an
action
under
unseaworthiness.
the
court
went
on,
rather
congress
went
on
further
to
suggest
further
and
then
reciting
ryan
stevedoring
versus
pan-atlantic.
the
third
party
action,
the
tripartite
cause
of
litigation
which
had
burdened
the
courts
and
had
expended
large
sums
of
money
by
the
stevedore
and
his
carrier
ownership
on
alike
is
better
put
to
use
paying
compensation.
and
so
ryan
was
specifically
overruled.
(inaudible)
italia
society
versus
oregon
stevedoring,
all
cases
which
had
established
the
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness
was
specifically
overruled.
and
finally,
under
the
same
suggestion,
elimination
of
unseaworthy
remedy
--
unseaworthiness
remedy
we
finally
come
to
the
sentence
which
is
the
crux
of
this
case.
the
vessel
will
not
be
chargeable
with
the
negligence
of
the
stevedore
or
employees
of
the
stevedore.
respondent
and
the
fourth
circuit,
i
suggest
erroneously
have
interpreted
that
statement
to
mean
that
a
percentage
of
negligence
requires
only
a
percentage
of
payment
when
in
fact
what
was
intended
here
by
the
vessel
not
being
chargeable
with
the
negligence
of
the
stevedore
was
to
do
away
with
seas
shipping
which
said
that
in
effect,
the
shipowner
is
vicariously
responsible
for
the
acts
of
the
stevedore
and
thus
becomes
liable
when
the
stevedore
commits
an
acts
on
negligence.
today,
under
the
amendments,
the
act
of
negligence
must
be
committed
by
the
shipowner
himself.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
they
cannot
be
more
than
one
proximate
cause
of
an
injury
and
nowhere
was
it
intended
by
congress
that
the
shipowner
would
become
liable
in
tort
if
it
were
the
sole
and
exclusive
tortfeasor.
to
suggest
that
is
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
as
congress
has
said
to
cause
to
the
shipowner
to
remain
responsible
to
his
obligations
in
tort
to
the
injured
longshoreman.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
if
we
are
talking
about
comparative
fault
of
others
besides
the
injured
person,
clearly,
under
every
case
that
has
ever
been
decided,
it
must
give
that
injured
person
100%
of
the
recovery
with
the
exception
of
those
states
which
have
incorporated
into
a
statute
under
the
doctrine
of
comparative
negligence,
under
the
common
law
doctrine
of
ordinary
negligence
both
land
and
maritime,
the
injured
person
always
was
entitled
to
the
whole
because
his
harm
is
indivisible
even
though
two
or
three
or
four
may
have
cause
to
contribute
it.
the
broken
leg
is
the
broken
leg
and
if
three
people
concurrently
aided
in
breaking
it,
he
still
has
one
harm.
and
so,
my
answer
to
you
sir
is
that
every
case
has
always
held
that
the
injured
party
is
entitled
to
the
full
recovery
at
common
law.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
have
argued
in
my
brief
that
the
ultimate
economic
loss
is
going
to
be
shared
between
the
stevedore
and
the
shipowner
somehow
or
other
in
any
event.
but
the
sole
purpose
that
we're
here
is
because
they
are
both
in
concert
suggesting
that
the
injured
person
suffered
the
economic
loss
and
he
is
the
least
able
to
bear
that
loss.
you
are
correct
sir,
regardless
of
this
court's
ruling
provided
it
gives
the
injured
longshoreman
his
full
recovery.
sooner
or
later
in
the
course
of
dealing
between
the
stevedore
and
the
shipowner,
the
cost
will
be
passed
on
to
the
shipowner
and
the
ultimate
consumer.
no
question
about
that.
the
issue
then
is,
do
we
take
it
away
from
the
injured
party
so
that
their
respective
losses
are
less.
common
law
doesn't
permit
that.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
yes,
sir.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
that
is
correct.
preserve
the
rule
of
the
--
the
conflict
in
the
statutory
language.
the
second
sentence
was
intended
solely
to
do
away
with
reed
versus
yaka.
the
issue
of
the
vessel
not
being
chargeable
with
the
negligence
of
the
stevedore
referred
to
the
unseaworthiness
vicarious
liability
which
had
come
as
a
result
of
seas
shipping
versus
sieracki.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
yes,
i
--
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
to
preserve
--
well,
let
me
modify
that,
reed
versus
yaka
had
two
rules.
one
rule
was
that
the
shipowner
who
is
a
stevedore
--
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
--
is
his
own
stevedore,
is
responsible
as
a
shipowner.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
that
rule
was
intended
to
be
preserved.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
yes.
and
the
second
portion
of
reed
versus
yaka
which
follows
seas
shipping
which
said
that
unseaworthiness
is
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
that
was
intended
to
be
overruled.
so
really
they
were
modifying
reed
v.
yaka
but
retaining
the
portion
which
said,
“if
you
are
a
shipowner
and
the
stevedore
at
the
same
time,
you
are
responsible
as
a
shipowner
not
as
a
stevedore.”
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
no,
sir.
only
for
negligence
as
a
shipowner.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
reed
versus
yaka
was
an
unseaworthiness
case.
and
reed
versus
yaka
was
the
case
which
held
that
the
shipowner
could
not
abort
the
law
by
hiring
his
own
longshoreman.
it
held
that
if
he
were
a
stevedore
and
a
shipowner,
he
was
responsible
as
a
shipowner.
now,
---
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
for
unseaworthiness
or
for
negligence
certainly.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
well,
reed
versus
yaka
did
not.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
that
was
the
holding
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
this
--
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
that
is
correct.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
every
court
of
appeals
that
is
ruled
on
that
point
has
so
held.
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
touch
the
point
in
its
argument
and
concluded
only
that
the
only
way
you
could
reconcile
the
two
sentences
was
to
come
up
with
a
rule
of
proportionate
fall.
a
rule
of
proportionate
fault
as
between
tortfeasors
is
really
not
a
rule
at
all
as
to
the
injured
person
proportionate
fault
should
speak
to
the
degree
of
liability
as
between
the
tortfeasors.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
yes,
sir.
that's
specifically
within
the
statute.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
that
is
not
at
issue
here?
we
concede
there
was
$100,000.00
verdict
here.
we
concede
that
10%
of
that
is
a
reduction
as
a
result
of
the
longshoreman's
own
fault.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
it
is
to
preserve
the
action
against
the
shipowner
who
was
likewise
a
stevedore.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
right.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
to
provide
stevedoring
services,
no
such
action
shall
be
permitted
if
the
injury
was
cause
by
the
negligence
of
persons
engaged
in
providing
stevedoring
services.
what
they
were
saying
is
that
the
shipowner
as
a
shipowner
remains
liable.
as
a
stevedore,
he
does
not.
he's
got
two
heads
at
that
moment.
if
it's
the
stevedoring
services
that
are
the
sole
cause
of
this
man's
injury
or
that
create
an
unseaworthy
condition
aboard
that
vessel,
then
there
is
no
right
of
recovery.
but
if
the
shipowner
as
a
shipowner
for
instance,
bringing
in
grease
and
oil
from
another
port
and
leaving
it
on
the
deck,
or
having
a
defect
of
which,
which
was
not
part
of
its
stevedoring
operation
remains
liable.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
preserving
reed
versus
yaka.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
(voice
overlap)
the
committee
reports
have
said
so.
the
committee
report
--
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
sir.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
oh,
i
think
it's
very
poorly
drafted.
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
was
just
a
very
simple
matter
for
them
to
put
in
proportionate
fall
if
they
had
intended.
and
if
they
had
intended
it
by
this
sentence,
it
is
grossly
inartfully
drafted.
but
i
don't
think
that
was
the
intendment
of
congress
because
at
the
time,
proportionate
fault
was
not
a
doctrine
known
in
maritime
law.
at
the
time
in
1972,
when
these
amendments
were
passed
and
before
this
court
had
ruled
in
reliable,
the
only
proportionate
fault
that
ever
existed
was
the
old
5050
rule
which
later
this
court
amended.
but
of
course
when
the
court
acted
in
reliable,
it
did
so
changing
a
common
law
doctrine
and
not
a
matter
that
had
been
heavily
debated
by
the
congress.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
yes,
admiralty
law
doctrine.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
he
can
under
reed
versus
yaka
and
he
can
under
this
preservation
in
the
amendment.
the
committed
belief
--
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
yes.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
on
page
11
of
the
committee
report,
the
committee
has
recognized
a
need
for
special
provisions
to
deal
with
the
case
where
a
longshoreman
or
shipowner
or
repairman
is
employed
directly
by
the
vessel.
in
such
case
notwithstanding,
the
fact
that
the
vessel
is
the
employer,
the
supreme
court
in
reed
versus
yaka
and
jackson
versus
lykes
held
that
the
unseaworthiness
is
available
to
the
injured
employee.
it
then
goes
on
to
say
that
it
wants
to
retain
that
right
of
action
against
the
shipowner.
throughout
something
like
1200
pages
of
testimony,
there
was
never
once
the
statement
of
proportionate
fault
propounded
to
the
congress.
one
speaker,
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
kaplan
who
spoke
on
behalf
of
a
plaintiff's
bar
in
passing
mention
that
it
may
be
a
harsh
rule
to
put
all
of
the
burden
on
either
the
shipowner
or
the
stevedore
and
perhaps
some
proportionate
fault
would
be
appropriate
and
he
was
immediately
shut
down
and
that
was
the
only
time
that
was
ever
mentioned
in
the
reports.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
multiple
other
speakers.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
actually,
it
was
the
senator's
questioning
when
he
shut
it
down
i
forgotten
quite
frankly
who
--
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
yes,
that's
correct,
shut
it
down
and
there
was
--
it
was
never
heard
from
again.
mr.
vickery
in
his
article
which
was
cited
by
judge
haynsworth
suggests
that
congress
had
intended
that.
however,
he
was
on
the
witness
stand
for
a
substantial
length
of
time.
his
testimony
is
many
pages
long
and
he
never
wants
throughout
his
entire
testimony
mentioned
the
issue
of
proportionate
fault
or
anything
that
resembled
it.
now,
they
did
put
in
a
comparative
negligence
rule
was
a
rule
aimed
at
aiding
the
injured
longshoreman
so
that
he
did
not
suffer
the
harsh
common
law
rule
of
being
barred
in
the
event
he
is
contributorily
negligent
in
any
degree.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
yes.
and
it
was
specifically
retained
by
statute
here.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
the
reason
--
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
because
in
the
legislation,
they
said
that
the
right
of
recovery
by
the
longshoreman
shall
be
identical
to
land-based
law.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
and
therefore
to
preserve
it,
they
added
the
comparative
negligence
the
lack
of
assumption
of
risk.
other
doctrines
that
were
not
land-based.
in
short
what
we
have
here
and
--
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
no,
sir.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
alright
sir.
i
will
take
just
one
or
two
more
moments
and
then
--
i
did
not
see
it.
the
other
issue
which
i'd
like
to
bring
out
is
this.
in
effect
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
legislate
because
the
statute
seems
clear
that
it
never
intended
a
doctrine
of
proportionate
fault.
in
section
933,
it
specifically
said
that
when
the
stevedore
file
suit
he
is
entitled
as
the
first
order
of
business
to
recover
his
expenses
and
every
penny
that
he
is
paid.
and
his
suit
is
of
course
is
derivative.
this
court
in
higginbotham
declined
to
legislate
or
go
further
when
it
was
posed
with
a
statutory
interpretation.
this
court
just
a
few
weeks
ago
in
(inaudible),
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
wrote
it,
declined
to
go
further
in
interpreting
the
act.
it
is
suggested
that
this
court
again
should
not
attempt
to
legislate
when
it
became
clear
what
congress
had
intended.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
one
very
brief
comment,
i
realize
it
is
beyond
the
normal
time
for
the
court.
in
cooper
versus
stevedoring
in
1974,
this
court
held
that
halcyon
versus
haenn
was
still
good
law
under
the
facts.
those
facts
were
identical
in
all
respects
with
the
case
here,
a
stevedore
who
is
immune
from
suit
of
by
the
injured
party
and
sues
the
shipowner
and
recovers
in
full.
there
is
no
contribution
in
tort
from
the
immune
employer.
the
statute
intended
to
keep
that.
when
the
statute
said
that
the
employer
shall
not
be
liable
to
the
vessel
for
such
damages,
directly
or
indirectly
and
in
any
agreements,
the
warrants
of
the
contrary
shall
be
void.
it
was
specifically
intended
by
congress
regardless
of
the
equities
as
argued
here
that
the
stevedore
not
play
a
part
in
the
tort
action
or
not
suffer
contribution
by
waiving
what
would
normally
be
the
lien
that
it
should
recover.
and
in
exchange
for
that,
the
stevedores
have
paid
two,
three,
and
sometimes
four
times
as
much
in
weekly
compensation
as
they
did
before
the
act.
they
give
what
was
a
relatively
small
payment
and
tripartite
litigation
and
got
in
exchange
higher
payments
but
absolutely
no
litigation.
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
and
if
we
follow
the
fourth
circuit,
we
must
then
implead
the
stevedore
in
this
case
and
in
every
case
to
find
out
what
is
the
percentage
of
their
fault.
this
was
an
ex
parte
determination
of
70%
in
which
they
played
no
part
or
hearing
and
clearly
if
they
were
there,
advocating
their
position,
as
they
must
do
under
the
fourth
circuit
in
every
other
case
from
hereon
in.
they
become
a
party
to
the
litigation.
it's
exactly
what
congress
was
intending
to
avoid.
mr.
calvin
w.
breit
if
the
court
rules
that
the
longshoreman
is
entitled
to
his
common-law
remedy
of
100%
recovery
from
the
shipowner
which
we
have
espouse
and
which
the
other
circuits
have
held
then
no
one
will
ever
be
back
here
because
he
will
be
required
to
repay
his
lien
to
the
stevedore
and
receive
a
credit
against
future
compensation
which
may
be
payable.
we
don't
know
now
what
the
lien
is.
we
may
never
know
what
the
lien
is
until
this
man
dies
because
it's
an
ongoing
lien
and
each
year
it's
subject
to
change
under
a
formula
device
by
congress
geared
to
inflation.
so
that
each
year,
his
formula
changes.
we
suggest
that
there
would
be
no
further
litigation
except
if
this
court
says
that
the
fourth
circuit
is
correct
and
we
have
to
go
now
under
the
district
court
and
fight
over
the
distribution
and
then
every
case
thereafter
will
have
to
be
fought
with
the
stevedore
involved
to
determine
whether
they
are
70,
60,
50
or
30%
at
fault
and
congress
did
not
intend
it.
thank
you.
