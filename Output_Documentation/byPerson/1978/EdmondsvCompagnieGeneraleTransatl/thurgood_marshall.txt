do
i
get
the
feeling
that
in
most
of
the
maritime
cases
as
one
insurance
may
have
to
have
to
pay
it
all
in
their,
so
what
that
cause
litigation?
that
law
had
paid
it
anyway?
justice

mr.
tucker,
let's
get
away
from
some
semantics
a
minute.
the
maritime
bar
that
doesn't
recognize
the
word
tort
at
all,
does
it?
this
moment,
tortfeasors,
am
i
right?
it
(inaudible)
it's
not
quite
a
tort.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
you
had
joint
wrongers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
that's
why
i
thought,
you
just
don't
like
to
use
the
word
tort.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
i'm
not
condemning
the
court.
