mr.
dickstein,
are
you
--
i
take
it
you're
making
the
argument
that
even
if
there
were
no
labor
laws
at
all,
no
federal
labors
statutes
and
only
the
securities
laws
that
this
would
not
be
a
security.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
also
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
arguing
that
even
if
it
--
otherwise
would
be
a
security,
the
federal
labor
laws
in
effect
make
an
exception
to
the
securities
or
laws,
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
arguing
that
the
labor
law
is
--
the
labor
laws
require
a
different
construction
of
the
securities
laws
then
otherwise
it
would
be
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
would
you
say
the
impact
to
the
labor
laws
is
equivalent
to
their
being
an
exception
in
this
securities
laws
that
--
is
that
your
argument
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
why
isn't
a
simple
answer
that
it
wasn't
until
recently
that
they
considered
this
matter,
this
to
be
a
sale.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
sale
--
what
about
the
sale
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
commission's
position
that
it
is
a
sale
now
for
the
purpose
of
registration?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
did
the
commission
first
assert
that
an
interest
--
acquiring
an
interest
in
a
pension
plan
is
a
sale,
is
a
sale,
affirmatively
said
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
keep
emphasizing
the
motive
that
it
--
and
used
this
people
to
invest.
what
option
did
this
particular
individual
have,
he's
going
to
take
the
job
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he's
going
to
take
this
job,
he
had
to
become
a
member
of
this
plan,
didn't
he?
