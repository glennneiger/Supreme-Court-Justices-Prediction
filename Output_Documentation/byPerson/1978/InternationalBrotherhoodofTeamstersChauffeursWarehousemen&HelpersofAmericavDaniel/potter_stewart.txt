justice
potter
stewart
of
course
mr.
carmell,
not
every
retirement
plan
is
a
product
of
collective
bargaining.
we
had
one
before
us
last
term
in
allied
structural
steel
which
was
not
at
all
a
product
of
collective
bargaining
and
therefore
wouldn't
have
involved
any
of
the
rights
and
liabilities
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
--
but
sometimes
it's
not
even
a
collective
bargaining
agent.
i
mean,
if
it's
a
non-unionized
plan
such
as,
i
guess
allied
structural
steel
was,
the
plaintiffs
would
not
have
any
of
this
other
four
--
wouldn't
have
three
out
of
these
other
four
causes
of
action,
would
they,
couldn't
have
had?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
wouldn't
--
you
would
--
wouldn't
you
agree
that
judge
tone's
concurring
opinion
is
evidence
of
anything
but
a
value
of
judgment
that
he
instinctively
--
his
sense
of
values
or
his
sense
of
--
his
instinctive
sense
would
have
led
him
the
other
way
but
he
thought
he
was
driven
to
this
conclusion
by
the
language
of
the
statute,
isn't
that
about
what
he
said?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
that
case
the
security
is
the
stock
of
the
employer
corporation
rather
than
the
participation
of
the
pension
plan.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
one
is
the
interest
of
the
plan,
then
why
isn't
this
a
security?
justice
potter
stewart
but
we
are
talking
about
a
dissipating
interest
in
a
retirement
plan.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
it's
a
security
in
one
case
why
isn't
it
in
the
other,
quite
apart
from
the
employer
stock.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that
and
i
understand
that
the
--
that
you
concede
the
--
that
that
one
special
kind
of
a
retirement
plan
is
subject
to
sec
jurisdiction
under
the
securities
laws
and
i
understand
the
factual
difference
but
i
don't
understand
if
the
participation
--
the
participatory
interest
in
the
retirement
plan
itself
is
a
security,
in
one
case,
why
isn't
it
in
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well
in
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case
the
funds
of
the
planner,
he
has
to
buy
what
are
conceitedly
securities.
justice
potter
stewart
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
many
--
but
the
funds
of
no
retirement
plan
entirely
is
quite
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
are
the
funds
--
what
--
how
are
the
funds
invested
to
this
plan?
not
in
securities?
justice
potter
stewart
in
no
securities
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
my
question.
that
was
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
are
invested
in
securities.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
concede
that
it
isn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
one
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
understood
that
the
principal
thrust
of
your
argument
not
that
you
don't
make
the
one
suggested
in
your
answer
to
my
brother
white
but
that
the
principal
thrust
of
your
argument
with
respect
to
the
labor
laws
and
wppda
and
erisa
is
that
they
reflect
congressional
understanding
that
pension
plans
are
simply
not
covered
by
the
securities
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
based
upon
that
understanding.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
you
go
back
to
1934,
there
is
no
private
right
of
action
at
all
under
10
(b)
of
the
34
act.
you'd
win
your
case
on
that
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
he
gets
work,
he
sells
it,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
its
--
what
kind
of
a
benefit
plan,
defined?
justice
potter
stewart
defined.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
the
word.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
going
back
to
what
you
said
at
the
outset,
the
solicitor
general
does
agree
with
you
on
the
sale
issue,
does
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
fact
despite
what
commissioner
purcell
may
have
said,
we
all
know
what
he
said,
we
--
there's
a
dispute
as
to
what
he
meant.
acting
chairman
andrew
d.
orich
(ph)
in
the
late
50's
testified
before
a
congressional
committees
quite
in
a
contrary
way,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
he
testified
that
the
sec
had
no
business
with
this
and
didn't
know
anything
about
it
and
please
don't
give
us
any
jurisdiction
over
it.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
registration
under
the
33
act?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
securities
act
(voice
overlap)
--
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
from
34,
i
take
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
asking
justice
stewart,
i'm
asking
you.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
you're
talking
generally
or
just
about
welfare
funds,
i'm
sure
the
sec
wouldn't
agree
with
your
very
loose
duty
that
your
language
seems
to
impose
upon
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
upon
an
issue
where
the
right
over
proxy
statement,
all
that's
required
is
a
good
faith
effort.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
scienter
or
its
equivalent.
justice
potter
stewart
scienter
or
its
equivalent?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
held
in
the
ernst
case
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
can't
reversely
as
suggested
a
few
minutes
ago
by
the
chief
justice
if
they
don't
like
the
reversal
of
this
decision
they
could
also
change
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
walner
i
hope
somebody's
going
to
--
there
are
two
issues
here.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
this
is
the
security
and
whether
this
is
a
sale.
justice
potter
stewart
and
we've
heard
on
both
those
issues
from
the
other
side,
you
said
you
were
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
cover
(voice
overlap)
i
hope
mr.
barack
will
because
as
chief
justice
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we're
concerned
here
with
despite
of
all
the
elaborate
briefing
and
argument
with
two
rather
precise
and
fairly
technical
questions,
i.e.
whether
within
the
meaning
of
the
1933
and
1934
acts
and/or
those
two
statutes.
this
interest
is
a
security
and
if
so
if
there
was
a
sale
of
it.
those
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
those
are
precise
statutory
questions
not
--
and
if
you're
talking
about
economic
effects
you
could
be
talking
about
insurance
or
bank
savings
account
or
lots
of
other
things
that
are
not
covered
by
the
securities
act.
justice
potter
stewart
unless
the
forms
of
investment,
i
mean
let's
have
--
we're
not
securities.
that's
a
--
an
insurance
policy
is
not
a
security
although
it's
a
savings
device
and
a
pooling
device.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
but
it's
correct.
