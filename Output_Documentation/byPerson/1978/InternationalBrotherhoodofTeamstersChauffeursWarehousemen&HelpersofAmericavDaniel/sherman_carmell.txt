mr.
sherman
carmell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1950,
the
respondent,
john
daniel
began
employment
under
the
jurisdiction
of
teamsters
local
705.
five
years
later,
local
705
negotiated
a
contract
which
provided
for
the
first
time
for
a
pension
fund
which
is
the
local
705
pension
fund.
in
addition
to
being
structured
in
accordance
with
section
302
(c)
(5)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947,
the
basic
features
of
the
local
705
pension
fund
were
and
are
that
it
is
a
defined
benefit
plan.
it
is
non-contributory.
it
is
mandatory.
between
december
of
1960
and
july
of
1961,
the
fund
record
show
no
employment,
covered
employment
for
mr.
daniel.
in
1973,
mr.
daniel
applied
for
a
pension.
after
two
hearings
before
the
boards
of
trustees
at
which
he
appeared,
the
trustees
denied
his
application
for
a
pension
based
upon
the
break
in
service
between
december
of
'60
and
july
of
1961
as
not
meeting
the
fund's
eligibility
rule.
as
a
result,
mr.
daniel
filed
and
then
amended
a
six-count
complaint
in
the
district
court.
two
of
the
counts,
the
first
two
which
are
before
this
court
were
posited
upon
the
securities
laws.
two
counts
were
based
upon
section
302
of
the
lmra.
one
count
alleged
the
breach
duty
of
fair
representation
under
section
9
(a)
of
the
nlra
and
one
count
was
a
pendent
jurisdiction
claim
for
state
common-law
fraud.
the
local
705
petitioners
moved
to
dismiss
all
of
the
counts.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss
all
of
the
counts.
the
case
proceeded
up
on
the
counts
i
and
ii,
the
securities
acts
counts
which
are
before
this
court.
in
this
posture,
your
--
may
it
please
the
court,
the
case
does
not
involve
the
merits
of
the
local
705
pension
funds
service
rule.
and
although
though
the
respondent
in
a
discussion
of
erisa
at
page
97
of
his
brief
before
this
court
states,
“to
allow
erisa
to
preempt
the
antifraud
provisions
of
the
federal
securities
laws
would
be
to
deny
daniel
any
relief
whatsoever.”
the
respondent
told
the
district
court
at
appendix
152
(a),
“that
even
if
the
security
counts
should
be
challenged
or
reversed
on
appeal,
i
feel
that
the
other
counts
would
be
viable.”
the
result
of
reversal
in
this
case
then
would
be
that
proceedings
would
continue
in
the
district
court
under
the
two
section
302
counts,
the
duty
--
the
breech
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and
state
law
common
fraud.
please
the
court,
i
wish
to
direct
my
arguments
to
the
differences
which
may
be
found
between
the
securities
acts
and
the
labor
statutes
in
the
area
of
labor
relations.
the
labor
statutes
as
i
refer
to
them
are
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
lmra,
the
welfare
pension
plan
disclosure
act
and
erisa.
and
when
using
the
term
labor
relations,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
not
speaking
only
of
union
management
or
collectively
bargain
plans.
i
am
talking
of
the
full
spectrum
of
employer-employee
relations
that
is,
those
pension
plans
which
involved
the
relationship
between
an
employer
and
an
employee
of
which
one
is
a
collectively
bargained
pension
plan.
the
one
consensus
which
i
believe
can
be
found
from
the
mass
of
briefs
among
the
courts,
the
parties
and
the
amici
is
that
the
legislative
history
and
the
provisions
of
the
securities
acts
do
not
mention
pension
plans
as
such.
on
the
other
hand
and
this
is
the
point
of
our
argument,
the
labor
statutes
beginning
in
1935
and
consistently
through
erisa
have
discussed,
considered,
made
discreet,
cohesive
and
sometimes
very
detailed
judgments
as
to
the
types
of
disclosure,
as
to
the
rights
of
actions
of
participants
if
any
and
as
to
the
duties
and
obligations
of
plan
trustees
to
the
beneficiaries.
a
review
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
wagner
act
was
undertaken
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
its
seminal
decision
in
inland
steel
which
at
77
nlrb.
the
board
after
reviewing
both
senator
--
the
1935
statute
and
the
1947
amendments
to
that
statute
which
would
have
changed
the
term
other
conditions
of
employment
to
a
more
narrow
term
working
conditions
stated
that
it
was
compelled
to
the
conclusion
and
we
find
that
matters
affecting
tenure
of
employment
like
the
respondents,
inland
steels,
retirement
rule
are
within
the
statutory
scope
of
collective
bargaining.
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
found
that
the
debates
in
1947
over
those
proposed
amendments
were
“compelling
evidence”
that
retirement
plans
were
within
the
1935
acts
intent.
the
significance
of
this,
may
it
please
the
court,
should
not
be
lost
because
1935
is
the
same
chronological
era
that
the
1933
and
1934
security
acts
were
being
put
into
law.
so
in
1935,
whereas
the
security
acts
said
nothing,
congress
was
speaking
distinctly
to
the
issue
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
sherman
carmell
it
is
correct
to
that
--
to
the
extent
your
honor
that
they
all
were
not
necessarily
bargained
for.
but
with
due
respect,
it
is
not
correct
to
the
extent
that
all
pension
plans
were
subjects
for
a
collective
bargaining.
that
is
8
(5)
of
the
old
act
in
1935
act,
an
885
of
the
present
act,
only
refers
to
those
--
only
encompasses
mandatory
subjects
for
bargaining.
mr.
sherman
carmell
they
would
not
have
had
cause
of
action
under
section
302.
that
is
correct.
there
was
no
cause
of
action
under
the
wppda.
there
was
no
private
cause
of
action
under
the
nlra
or
the
lmra.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
as
i
would
hope
to
explain,
that
was
congress'
deliberate
choice
and
is
most
fully
canvassed
in
this
court's
decision
in
malone
as
to
the
specific
choices
that
congress
made
but
i
would
like
to
address
once
more
your
specific
point.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
nlra
covered
only
collectively
bargained
plans.
i
am
saying
that
congress
considered
retirement
plans
and
the
inland
steel
plan
had
been
in
existence
for
a
long
period
of
time
before
that
as
being
a
subject
for
collective
bargaining.
so
whereas
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
reason
why
congress
and
the
securities
acts
did
not
consider
pension
plans
or
i
mention
them
was
that
they
were
rather
innocuous
in
number,
the
same
congress
relatively
was
considering
them
to
be
sufficient
importance
to
be
considered
within
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
as
opposed
to
permissive
subjects
of
bargaining.
1947
as
your
honor's
already
pointed
out,
saw
congress
enact
section
302
(c)
(5)
and
i
think
the
significance
of
section
302
your
honors
is
that
congress
made
a
deliberate
choice.
it
shows
only
to
regulate
collectively
bargained
pension
plan
as
mr.
justice
stewart
stated.
although
it
had
before
it
considerations
of
other
issues
and
it
shows
then
to
only
regulate
the
structure
of
the
plan
and
certain
of
the
extent
of
the
purposes
which
the
funds
could
be
used.
a
very,
very
limited
regulation
by
congress
but
a
very
deliberate
regulation
as
this
court
discussed
in
arroyo
versus
the
united
states.
but,
the
welfare
and
pension
plan
disclosure
act,
the
proceedings
from
1954
on
which
were
fully
canvassed
in
this
court's
decision
in
malone
are
really
the
most
significant,
i
believe.
because
malone
stated
that
congress
entered
“a
nearly
unregulated
pension
field.”
and
congress
heard
from
numerous
witnesses
beginning
in
1955
including
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
commissioner
godwin
agreed
with
senator
allott
in
1955
that
“the
securities
and
exchange
commission
would
comment
to
this
particular
field
only
by
accident,
so
to
speak,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
for
example
in
some
of
these
plans
stock
is
offered.”
after
congress
heard
all
of
the
witnesses
including
the
commission,
it
issued
a
senate
report
which
is
quoted
and
i
won't
go
through
it
all
the
pages
29
and
30
of
our
brief
stating
they
just
didn't
think
there
was
any
federal
regulation
of
these
plans
but
shows
not
to
regulate
its
substantively
but
as
this
court
noted
just
to
allow
filings.
by
1972
your
honors,
we
all
know,
as
this
discussion
in
manhart
indicates,
congress
had
completely
changed
its
mind
and
had
completely
made
a
complete
turnaround
as
far
as
the
priorities
and
that
therefore
under
erisa
detailed
the
timing
nature
and
disclosure
that
was
to
be
made
to
plan
participants
and
for
the
first
time
under
section
502
(a)
granted
a
limited
right
of
suit
by
a
plan
participant
and
granted
a
conjunctive
right
to
sue
with
the
secretary
of
labor.
1958,
welfare
and
pension
plan
disclosures
acts
failure
to
include
a
private
right
of
action
was
not
an
accident
your
honor
because
as
our
brief
has
shown,
it
rejected
proposals
by
professor
metlzer
and
cox
that
would
have
established
the
analogous
right
of
action.
erisa's
design
was
careful,
complex,
discrete
and
fraught
with
a
great
number
of
problems.
but
in
the
end,
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
satisfied
with
congress's
action
in
this
field.
it
felt
the
plan
participants
deserve
more.
it
made
value
judgments,
judgments
which
the
congress
is
entrusted
to
make
and
which
the
congress
specifically
did
not
make.
with
--
under
those
circumstances,
these
case
i
believe
and
the
courts
below
stands
for
the
proposition
that
a
court
can
expand
through
the
province
of
the
securities
acts
to
enact
that
type
of
legislation
which
for
almost
37
years
that
congress
deliberately
refused
to
enact
to
give
protection
to
plan
participants
that
congress
would
not
give
and
to
posit
causes
of
action
with
cong
--
which
congress
disclaimed.
mr.
sherman
carmell
i
don't
believe
it
was
--
by
the
breadth
of
the
statute
and
by
the
fact
that
this
court
has
not
spoken
particularly
to
the
issue
i
believe
was
another
factor.
i
don't
know
why
judge
tone's
opinion
did
not
end
with
our
dissent
because
i
believe
it
was
written
up
to
that
point
so
it
sounded
that
way.
so,
i
cannot
define
that
your
honor
but
i
don't
believe
that
full
consideration
was
given
to
the
labor
statutes,
the
line,
the
cohesive
line
from
the
labor
statutes
on
one
side
and
the
absence
of
anything
definitive
on
the
other
side.
as
i
said
your
honor
the
reverse
--
please
the
court,
the
reversal
of
this
case
does
not
end
the
case.
it
will
leave
mr.
daniel
and
his
class
of
plaintiffs
with
four
causes
of
action
under
the
federal
labor
statutes
and
under
state
common
law
fraud.
mr.
sherman
carmell
i
don't
believe
that
the
issue
as
framed
now
that
question
is
critical.
i
believe
that
the
appendix
does
show
only
a
--
the
brief
does
show
a
statement
that
was
contained
in
one
of
the
palm
booklets
that
your
benefits
terminate
if
you
take
a
withdraw
card.
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
mr.
justice
stevens,
we
are
accepting
the
fact
that
he
had
a
break
in
service
which
was
involuntary
and
by
a
layoff
and
will
--
except
for
the
premise
that
it
was
--
should
have
only
run
four
months.
i
don't
believe
that
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
break
in
service
rule
is
relevant
to
the
securities
acts
counts
because
if
it's
an
arbitrary
structural
violation,
under
section
302
(c)
(5)
there
is
a
remedy
or
at
least
there
appear
--
the
district
court
has
said
that
there
is
a
remedy.
