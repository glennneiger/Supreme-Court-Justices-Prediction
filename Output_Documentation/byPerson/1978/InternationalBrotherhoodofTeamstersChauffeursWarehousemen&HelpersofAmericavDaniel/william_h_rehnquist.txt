justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
did
the
sec
mr.
stillman
first
have
the
position
that
agreement
such
as
this
was
an
investment
contract
for
purposes
of
the
securities
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
the
intervening
37
years,
why
wasn't
the
commission
out
seeking
injunctions
against
one
or
another
of
these
plans
that
--
presuming,
just
by
the
law
of
averages
would
have
proved
fraudulent
or
failure
to
disclose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
still
--
mr.
stillman.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
commission
is
as
free
after
this
relative
period
of
quiescence
to
take
the
position
and
now
it
does
in
view
of
the
enactment
of
wppda
in
1958
and
erisa
in
1974
is
it
would
have
been
prior
to
the
enactments
of
those
laws?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but,
congress
has
really
been
proceeding
on
two
different
tracks
hasn't
it
since
1958,
one
for
securities
and
one
for
pension
funds.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
argument
wouldn't
they
have
to
be
registered
even
though
not
fraudulent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
the
long
standing
sec
policy
would
cause
you
to
lose
your
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
mr.
mcdaniel
signed
the
pass
--
signed
on
in
the
pension
agreement
as
recently
formulated
to
prog
--
guarantee
him
on
$240.00
or
$250.00
a
month
as
justice
stevens
questions
you
about,
was
there
any
promise
that
he
would
get
more
than
that
if
the
investments
went
well?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
--
was
there
any
provision
in
the
agreement
to
that
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
forfeitability
doesn't
mean
it's
not
a
security
does
it
because
then
you
can
have
an
agreement
of
sale
for
cost
of
land
and
if
you
got
a
bunch
of
orange
groves
on
it,
it
can
--
could
conceivably
come
within
the
howey-joiner
rationale
and
still
the
contract
might
be
forfeitable.
