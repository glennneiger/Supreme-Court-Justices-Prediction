mr.
lawrence
walner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
my
remarks
to
the
doomsday
argument
advanced
by
the
teamsters,
the
denial
of
any
possible
remedy
to
a
large
group
and
the
questions
of
sale.
my
colleague
will
take
up
the
question
of
the
definition
of
security
in
legislative
history
and
congressional
intent.
we
would
like
to
emphasize
the
fallacy
of
the
doomsday
argument
created
by
the
teamsters
and
some
of
their
amici
in
this
case.
we
have
alleged
that
mr.
daniel
was
intentionally,
fraudulently
induced
to
invest
in
the
teamster
pension
fund
by
materially
misleading
information.
the
teamsters
originally
claimed
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
upholding
the
daniel
decision
would
result
in
pension
industry
liability
of
$200
billion.
now
this
was
reduced
by
80%
to
$40
billion
by
some
of
their
amici
that
even
this
amount
is
an
incredible
and
absurd
claim
we
suggest.
in
fact
i
wonder
if
the
amici
propounding
this
position
really
perceive
the
essence
of
what
they're
asserting.
this
figure
that
they
suggest
assumes
that
$40
billion
of
pension
funds
are
sold
both
with
materially
misleading
information
as
well
as
the
concurrent
scienter
requirement
and
intent
to
defraud.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
support
the
allegation
that
so
many
funds
are
sold
with
that
requisite
intent.
mr.
lawrence
walner
no
sir.
there's
a
registration
exemption
we
feel
under
section
3
(a)
2
and
this
only
goes
to
the
issue
of
antifraud
we
feel
registration
is
expressly
exempt
--
was
expressly
exempt
in
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit.
we
feel
it's
expressly
covered
by
an
exemption
in
the
statute
itself
as
well
as
long
standing
sec
policy.
mr.
lawrence
walner
well
--
mr.
lawrence
walner
we
feel
they're
still
covered
under
the
expressed
exemption
of
382
of
the
33
act
and
we
feel
that
the
express
terms
of
the
statute
otherwise
embrace
the
antifraud
provisions,
the
registration
requirement
is
the
provision
that's
exempted
from
compliance.
the
teamsters
when
they
tried
to
bring
down
the
grob
study
again
reduce
their
doomsday
argument
from
a
figure
of
3.5
to
13.5
billion
but
the
grob
study
totally
ignored
the
scienter
requirement
of
the
ernst
case
and
in
effect
estimated
the
liability
that
would
result
if
the
vesting
and
break
in
service
provisions
of
erisa
were
made
retroactive
and
not
the
liability
if
antifraud
provisions
of
the
securities
laws
were
applied
to
pensions
retroactively.
i
would
like
to
just
read
two
sentences
at
the
end
of
the
grob
report
to
show
you
how
far
that
they'd
backed
off
from
their
damage
claims.
most
terminated
non-vested
participants
have
not
been
led
to
expect
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
pension.
if
liability
exists
only
with
respect
to
terminated
participants
who
received
information
leading
them
to
believe
--
leading
them
to
expect
the
pension,
it
does
not
apply
to
most
terminated
participants.
in
such
a
case,
the
potential
liability
would
be
of
very
small
fraction
of
the
amounts
shown.
now
even
in
the
shlensky
case
which
followed
daniel
in
upholding
the
pension
to
be
a
security.
the
complaint
was
dismissed
for
failure
to
allege
facts
establishing
scienter.
now,
there
is
no
requirement
as
we
understand
that
under
10
(b)
that
anything
be
told
the
members
but
when
something
is
told
to
them
all
that
is
required
is
a
bona
fide
attempt
to
truthfully
inform
the
members
on
whose
behalf
contributions
are
made
of
their
rights
and
risk
of
loss.
even
if
the
information
is
not
correct
the
absence
of
scienter
is
required
by
the
ernst
case
will
bar
any
claims
for
liability
under
the
antifraud
provisions
of
the
securities
laws.
mr.
lawrence
walner
i
think
it
reports
--
mr.
lawrence
walner
i'm
talking
only
about
the
antifraud
provisions.
mr.
lawrence
walner
i
think
if
there's
an
absence
of
scienter
and
under
private
cause
of
action,
there
simply
is
no
cause
of
action.
mr.
lawrence
walner
and
i
think
that
was
made
clear
in
the
ernst
case.
mr.
lawrence
walner
pardon?
mr.
lawrence
walner
the
--
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
walner
yes.
mr.
lawrence
walner
there
maybe
some
differences
in
the
kind
and
categories
of
proof
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
that
connection
that
since
erisa
has
been
discussed
as
a
--
in
effect
the
preemption
type
argument
although
they
haven't
used
the
words
preemption
that
erisa
has
cut
off
common
law
fraud.
absolutely
under
section
514,
they've
cut
off
all
common
law
and
statutory
state
remedies.
so
at
least
with
respect
to
the
people
who
must
claim
after
the
effect
of
date
of
erisa
they're
not
able
to
claim
any
benefit
from
common
law
fraud
or
common
law
breach
of
fiduciary
obligation
or
any
state
statutes
in
that
regard
and
the
teamsters
themselves
point
that
out
in
the
footnote
of
their
brief
citing
section
514
of
erisa.
mr.
lawrence
walner
no
sir.
our
--
we
were
slightly,
i
think
inadvertently
misquoted
by
mr.
carmell.
our
contention
is
that
we
are
a
pre-erisa
case
because
mr.
daniel
retired
before
the
effect
of
date
of
erisa.
erisa
has
been
the
subject
of
so
much
discussion
as
it
may
reflect
both
the
intent
of
congress
and
in
what
position
people
find
themselves
with
respect
to
potential
remedies
or
one
of
the
things
i
intended
to
go
in
later
related
to
the
cutoff
by
erisa
of
common
law
claims.
for
example,
for
an
em
--
a
person
in
a
corporate
pension
fund,
what
are
his
rights,
what
are
his
remedies
for
intentional
fraud
to
induce?
he
no
longer
has
a
common
law
or
state
statutory
right
of
any
character
under
514.
now
if
you
deny
him,
the
antifraud
provision
protection
so
that
if
his
fraudulently
induced
to
invest
in
a
pension
plan,
is
--
he
will
have
no
remedies
whatsoever
for
that
activity.
mr.
lawrence
walner
your
honor,
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
lawrence
walner
--
that
congress
never
intended
to
cutoff
the
antifraud
provisions.
they
have
specific
savings
clause
for
all
federal
remedies
and
i'm
suggesting
that
the
fact
that
this
large
group
of
people
would
find
themselves
without
a
remedy
for
that
wrong
is
not
something
congress
intended.
now,
we
feel
because
of
the
scienter
requirement
the
honest
pension
manager
is
shield
for
a
many
securities
fraud
liability.
and
if
that
is
not
sufficient
to
reflect,
protection
of
the
pension
industry,
senator
williams
did
introduced
a
bill
that
would
have
the
effect
of
reversing
the
daniel
case.
so
if
congress
doesn't
like
the
upholding
of
this
decision,
they
have
before
them
something
they
can
vote
on
that
would
reverse
it.
now
if
all
of
these
protections
--
mr.
lawrence
walner
absolutely.
if
these
protections
are
discussed
so
far
and
not
sufficient
to
alleviate
any
concern
the
court
may
have
about
the
effect
on
the
industry,
it
is
possible
of
course
for
the
court
to
fashion
different
forms
of
perspective
relief.
we
don't
believe
perspective
relief
is
appropriate
in
this
case
because
of
the
allegation
of
intentional
fraud
and
the
need
to
prove
intentional
fraud
to
establish
a
cause
of
action.
in
the
manhart
case
in
which
this
court
allowed
prospective
relief,
the
reading
indicates
it
was
done
so
because
of
the
conscientious
and
intelligent
administration
of
the
pension
fund
and
implicitly
the
good
faith
of
the
pension
fund
administers
--
administrators.
we
feel
that
a
prospective
relief
is
considered.
it
should
be
fashioned
so
it
was
not
to
deny
relief
against
the
defendants
in
this
case
and
in
the
consolidated
case.
because
in
the
consolidated
case,
consolidated
with
this
case
in
the
lower
court
we
do
have
the
central
states
pension
fund
as
a
defendant.
i'm
not
asking
for
any
relief
based
on
guilt
by
association
but
i
do
feel
that's
an
important
element
to
have
before
the
court.
now,
although
the
defendants
have
really
acknowledged
in
their
briefs
that
we
have
the
equities,
we're
not
asking
for
relief
based
on
sympathy
but
on
well
grounded
authority.
it's
not
the
unconscionable
rule
that
we're
complaining
about
in
the
securities
accounts
that
denied
mr.
daniel
a
pension.
that's
not
the
gravamen
our
complaint.
it's
the
intentional
misstatement
about
his
rights,
the
intentional
misrepresentation.
in
fact,
the
rule
is
so
bad
just
to
comment
on
it.
as
in
the
side,
mr.
daniel
could
not
have
gotten
a
pension
if
he
--
under
the
terms
of
his
rejection
if
he
had
not
missed
a
day
in
22
and
a
half
years,
because
the
rejection
letter,
we
discussed
it
in
the
footnotes
in
the
brief,
the
rejection
letter
says
that
he
has
denied
a
pension
for
six
and
a
half
or
seven-month
break
in
service.
he
missed
three
and
a
half
months
for
the
involuntary
layoff.
the
question
is
what
happened
to
the
other
three
and
a
half
months.
the
other
three
and
a
half
months
resulted
from
a
non
payment
of
the
pension
contribution
by
the
employer
allegedly
as
a
result
of
an
embezzlement
by
his
bookkeeper
but
the
denial
in
the
pension
letter
suggests
that
he
still
would
have
had
a
three
or
three
and
half-month
break
which
would
have
been
disqualifying
if
he
had
never
missed
a
single
day.
now,
and
speaking
about
fears
of
damage
to
the
industry,
the
teamsters
have
really
sought
the
masquerade
as
being
representative
of
the
industry
norm
in
terms
of
terms
of
their
plans,
administration
and
advise
to
members.
and
they've
tried
to
paint
a
picture
to
this
court
that
if
they
are
found
to
have
securities
fraud
scienter
in
the
lower
court
trial,
the
entire
pension
industry
is
doomed.
we
want
to
tell
you
that's
not
so.
in
reporting
a
study
made
by
their
own
agent,
the
defendants
revealed
that
a
comparison
with
32
other
teamster
pension
plans,
mr.
daniel
would
have
received
the
pension
and
all
of
them
except
the
local
705
pension
plan.
so
they
are
not
in
any
respect
representative.
mr.
lawrence
walner
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
walner
the
closest
analogy
investment
contract
your
honor
i
would
consider
to
be
a
mutual
fund
purchase
by
an
employee
through
his
union
or
variable
annuity
purchase
through
his
union.
i
see
no
real
difference
your
honor
between
money
contributed
directly
from
the
employee
to
the
pension
fund
or
money
contributed
directly
by
the
employer
bypassing
the
employee.
in
each
case
he
is
taking
a
reduction
of
what
would
be
a
wage.
he's
in
effect
buying
it
whether
he's
taking
that
out
of
his
own
pocket
or
the
employer's
paying
it
directly.
there
are
two
reasons.
mr.
lawrence
walner
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
walner
there
would
be
a
designated
participation
he
would
have.
mr.
lawrence
walner
but
he
also
has
--
mr.
lawrence
walner
if
it
were
a
mutual
fund
that
he
was
buying
with
those
own
money
--
mr.
lawrence
walner
if
--
and
he
pays
for
it.
mr.
lawrence
walner
he
would
--
he
couldn't
forfeit
it
under
those
terms.
mr.
lawrence
walner
the
thing
we're
complaining
about
is
he's
not
made
aware
of
the
forfeitures
opportunities
here.
mr.
lawrence
walner
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
lawrence
walner
there
are
other
examples
where
a
contingency
or
an
expectation
has
been
considered
security
and
this
contingency
--
mr.
lawrence
walner
pardon?
mr.
lawrence
walner
it
would
wipe
out
the
interest
in
the
security
and
the
example
i
have
in
mind
your
honor
specifically
is
an
employee's
stock
option
where
the
option
is
granted
to
the
employee
who
works
there
providing
he
remains
that
a
period
--
for
there
for
a
period
of
years.
it's
an
option
to
buy
the
stock
at
a
specific
price.
now
if
the
employee
leaves
--
mr.
lawrence
walner
but
it's
given
in
partial
consideration
for
his
services
because
if
he
leaves
the
employment
he
doesn't
have
the
option.
therefore,
he's
continuing
the
pay
for
it
with
his
service.
and
if
he
leaves
before
the
time
expires,
he
loses
all
interest
in
that
option.
its
further
contentions
your
honor
on
the
fact
that
even
when
the
option
right
vests
when
he
has
an
unconditional
rights
to
exercise
it,
it
would
still
be
valueless
unless
the
value
of
the
stock
is
in
excess
of
the
option
price.
mr.
lawrence
walner
i
believe
it
is
a
security
by
definition
or
by
a
case
decision.
mr.
lawrence
walner
if
they
have
to
register
their
securities
generally,
that
registration
would
cover
the
offer
to
the
employee.
if
they
don't
have
to
register
--
mr.
lawrence
walner
if
there's
a
registration
statement
in
effect
it
would
cover
that
employee.
mr.
lawrence
walner
if
there's
no
registration
in
effect
they
would
not
have
to
make
--
file
a
registration
statement
merely
because
of
the
employee
option
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
lawrence
walner
i
would
just
like
to
make
--
mr.
lawrence
walner
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
walner
yes.
mr.
lawrence
walner
i
was
going
to
cover
a
little
bit
of
sale
--
mr.
lawrence
walner
all
right,
i
just
want
to
make
two
remarks
on
response
to
mr.
dickstein's
arguments
with
respect
to
sale.
he
characterized
the
employees
entering
into
employment
at
something
about
which
the
pension
is
incidental.
in
many
cases
the
pension
is
the
primary
motive.
there
are
many
examples
of
a
person
who
will
stay
in
a
job
that
he
doesn't
like
or
not
change
jobs
because
he
is
expecting
a
pension
in
the
present
job.
he
may
even
forgo
a
job
with
higher
pay
because
when
you
count
up
the
benefits
of
the
pension,
it
amounts
to
more
money.
there
are
employees
who
will
stay
in
a
job
when
they're
sick,
when
they're
hurt
because
they
want
to
hang
on
the
last
few
years
to
get
a
pension.
certainly
in
those
cases
the
pension
is
the
primary
consideration
and
even
for
the
new
employee
seeking
a
career
and
deciding
to
make
a
choice
between
fields,
you
can
easily
discern
the
value
of
the
pension
to
him
in
evaluating
comparative
salaries
and
he
can
easily
compute
that
the
value
of
the
pension
will
have
a
certain
dollar
benefit
which
may
be
the
decision-making
factor
in
choosing
between
interest.
