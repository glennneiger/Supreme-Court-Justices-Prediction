mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
solicitor
general
has
requested
me
to
state
at
the
outset
that
although
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
is
participating
in
this
case
on
a
motion
may
jointly
by
the
commission
and
the
solicitor
general,
i
am
expressing
the
views
only
of
the
commission
and
not
of
the
solicitor
general
who
takes
a
different
view
of
the
case.
this
is
a
securities
case
and
the
issue
before
this
court
is
the
interpretation
of
terms
in
the
securities
laws
specifically
the
term
security
and
sale
and
it
is
to
that
question
those
legal
issues
under
the
securities
laws
that
the
commission
as
amicus
curiae
is
addressing
its
views
because
the
commission
believes
that
the
resolution
of
those
issues
is
important
to
investors.
of
the
two
issues,
security
and
sales,
we
believe
that
the
resolution
of
the
security
question
has
a
much
greater
potential
impact
on
investors
and
for
that
reason
i
would
like
to
address
that
issue
first.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
yes,
your
honor
on
that
issue
he
does
agree.
in
considering
whether
this
is
a
security,
mr.
daniel
for
more
than
22
years
worked
for
employers
who
in
return
for
his
labor
made
contributions
to
his
union's
pension
fund.
i
think
a
very
vivid
description
of
why
this
is
a
security
is
contained
in
the
union's
own
literature
that
it
distributed
to
its
members.
if
i
may
quote
two
sentences
from
page
70
(a)
14
of
the
appendix
in
one
of
the
brochures
that
the
union
distributed
it
contains
this
description
of
the
pension
fund
and
of
the
members'
contribution
--
of
the
contributions
that
are
made
on
behalf
of
the
members.
it
says,
“the
contributions,
earned
income
by
being
invested
consequently
the
money
originally
contributed
grows.
without
this
income
growth
the
fund
could
not
accumulate
enough
money
to
pay
the
$250.00
monthly
pensions
provided
by
the
plan.”
that
in
a
nutshell
is
what
an
investment
contract
is.
outside
of
the
employment
context,
it
is
clear
that
a
participation
in
a
fund
of
this
sort
which
invest
its
assets
and
returns
more
money
at
a
later
date
as
a
security
and
through
a
series
of
six
decisions
of
this
court
beginning
with
the
joiner
case
in
1943
and
continuing
most
recently
through
the
forman
decision
in
1975,
this
court
has
construed
the
term
investment
contract.
and
those
decisions
demonstrate
that
so
long
as
there
is
present
the
type
of
relationship
found
in
this
case,
a
relationship
in
which
the
investor
participates
in
a
common
venture
with
the
expectation
of
profits
to
be
derived
from
the
managerial
efforts
of
others,
there
is
a
security.
all
the
requisite
features
are
present
here.
the
employee
makes
an
investment
by
giving
value
in
the
form
of
his
labor.
the
purpose
of
the
fund
is
to
provide
employees
with
more
return
than
the
amounts
contributed
profits.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
not
--
not
that
i
am
aware
of
in
deciding
that
it's
a
security.
in
terms
of
a
constituting
value
for
purposes
of
a
sale,
yes,
your
honor.
but
that
involved
something
which
was
a
security
independently.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
i
believe
that
is
so
your
honor
but
does
not
affect
the
basic
relationship
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
series
of
six
decisions.
going
back
many
years
as
giving
rise
to
an
investment
contract
and
it
is
that
relationship
which
is
the
significant
thing
because
that
relationship
contains
the
elements
that
provide
the
need
for
the
kind
of
protections
that
the
securities
laws
afford.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
it
is
important
to
differentiate
as
i
think
you're
doing
the
question
of
security
versus
the
question
of
sale.
on
the
question
of
whether
it
is
a
security,
the
commission
took
the
position
as
far
back
as
1941
and
the
testimony
that
commissioner
purcell
gave
that
interest
in
pension
plans
are
securities.
the
defendant's
dispute
the
scope
of
what
commissioner
purcell
was
referring
to.
they
say
that
he
was
only
referring
to
interest
in
voluntary
contributory
plans.
i
think
an
examination
of
what
he
said
will
show
that
it
was
not
so
limited
because
when
he
talked
about
the
“no
sale”
rationale
as
being
applicable
to
the
type
of
plan
involved
here,
an
involuntary
noncontributory
plan,
that
was
the
very
same
type
of
plan
that
he
also
had
in
mind
as
involving
the
security.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
your
honor,
the
question
of
why
at
any
given
point
in
time
or
over
--
even
over
a
period
of
years,
certain
types
of
activity
does
not
give
rise
to
proceedings
whether
it
be
a
commission
proceeding
or
even
private
proceedings
is
of
--
is
something
that
is
very
difficult.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
the
focus
of
the
statements
over
the
years
about
no
sale
--
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
oh,
that's,
that's
what
i
was
getting
to
your
honor.
the
focus
of
the
commission's
statements
over
the
year
is
to
whether
it
was
a
sale.
the
focus
was
in
the
context
of
registration
and
indeed
judge
tone
in
his
concurring
opinion,
who
as
you
know
was
critical
of
the
commission,
acknowledged
that
the
focus
was
really
in
the
context
of
registration.
now
it'
s
true,
the
commission
did
not
come
out
and
affirmatively
say,
“we
are
only
talking
about
registration
and
the
no
sale
rationality
does
not
apply
for
fraud
purposes.”
but
it
was
clearly
in
that
context.
now,
as
to
why
the
commission
did
not
over
the
years
take
enforcement
action
in
the
fraud
area
with
respect
to
pension
plans.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
indication
that
even
in
the
case
of
the
voluntary
contributory
that
the
commission
took
enforcement
action
based
upon
the
theory
that
the
interest
was
a
security
and
that
there
was
a
sale.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
no,
your
honor,
that
goes
back
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
for
purposes
of
involuntary
noncontributory
plans
of
the
sort
involved
this
case
--
is
involved
in
this
case,
the
commission
as
far
as
i'm
aware
did
not
even
consider
the
matter
until
this
case
arose.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
your
honor,
he
did
not
testify
that
there
was
no
security
and
there
was
no
sale.
in
terms
of
the
testimony,
i
think
--
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
your
honor
in
context
i
think
that
has
to
be
judged
in
terms
of
the
kind
of
legislation
that
was
then
before
congress.
it
was
a
kind
of
legislation
far
different
from
a
simple
antifraud
provision.
it
was
legislation
that
would
have
imposed
considerable
day
to
day
obligations
of
a
more
formal
nature
on
people
involved
in
the
pension
area,
would
have
required
the
commission
itself
to
engage
in
administering
those
provisions
in
that
context
to
say
that
the
commission
was
not
the
proper
agency
to
administer
that
kind
of
legislation
is
far
different
from
saying
that
there
is
no
sale
of
a
security.
congress
itself
in
the
securities
laws
in
connection
with
certain
types
of
regulation
has
recognized
that
even
though
there
is
a
sale
of
a
security
not
all
types
of
regulation
under
the
securities
laws
should
apply.
for
example,
the
periodic
reporting
provisions
of
the
securities
exchange
act
they
only
apply
where
there
is
a
market
interest.
larger
corporations
with
securities
trade
it
in
the
market.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
if
you
have
a
corporation,
it
doesn't
rise
to
that
level,
you
don't
have
sales
of
securities.
it's
that
when
you
get
in
to
the
more
detailed
kind
of
--
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
in
certain
types
i'm
not
sure
of
the
details
that
--
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
the
reason
that
was
originally
given
back
in
commissioner
purcell's
testimony
back
in
1941
--
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
it
did
not
really
go
to
a
policy
question.
it
was
based
upon
the
view
at
that
time
that
it
did
not
involve
a
sale.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
now,
--
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
at
the
present
--
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
at
the
present
time
given
the
enactment
of
erisa
as
a
policy
matter
registration
probably
would
not
be
a
needed
thing.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
that's
right.
now
--
i
was
--
i
assume
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
at
the
present
time
given
erisa.
erisa
has
requirements
for
the
filing
with
the
government
and
the
dissemination
of
a
disclosure
document.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
if
i
may
refer
to
this
court's
decision
on
the
national
securities
case,
in
a
different
context
that
involved
a
question
of
whether
an
exchange
of
securities
by
a
shareholder
in
connection
with
the
merger
constitutes
a
sale.
for
purposes
of
the
antifraud
provisions
and
the
court
held
yes
that
it
was
a
sale.
in
the
face
of
a
commission
interpretation
over
the
years
and
commission
rule
saying
that
for
registration
purposes,
it
was
not
a
sale.
at
that
time
the
rule
was
premised
to
--
to
some
extent
on
the
same
kind
of
rationale
that
was
originally
used
by
the
commission
in
the
case
of
pensions,
lack
of
individual
volition
on
the
part
of
the
shareholder
who
votes
for
the
merger
and
therefore
not
a
sale.
and
the
court
expressly
recognized
that
the
term
sale
can
have
a
different
meaning
for
registration
purposes
from
what
it
means
for
sale
purposes.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
yes
sir.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
yes
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
those
laws
really
have
--
i
cannot
see
what
effect
they
have
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
“security”
and
the
meaning
of
the
world
“sale”.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
but
there
is
really
no
indication
that
congress
clearly
believe
that
the
antifraud
provisions
were
not
applicable.
the
kind
of
legislation
that
congress
was
enacting
in
the
pension
area
was
such
that
it
could
have
hardly
made
a
difference
whether
the
antifraud
provisions
were
applicable.
in
other
words,
the
suggestion
is
made
by
the
defendants
that
had
congress
realized
the
antifraud
provisions
were
applicable,
it
could
have
a
significant
effect
on
whether
they
would
have
enacted
the
kind
of
pension
legislation.
i
don't
see
that.
the
pension
legislation
that
we're
talking
about
imposed
detailed
affirmative
disclosure
filing
requirements,
the
preparation
of
documents
and
as
you
get
into
more
recent
years
with
erisa,
massive
regulatory
provisions.
it's
hardly
likely
that
because
of
the
presence
of
an
antifraud
provision,
congress
would
have
declined
to
enact
that
other
kind
of
legislation.
congress
in
the
securities
laws
didn't
decline
to
enact
the
registration
provisions
simply
because
there
was
an
antifraud
provision.
the
other
legislation
stood
on
its
own
and
was
necessary
even
with
the
presence
of
an
antifraud
provision.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
in
terms
of
the
man
on
the
street,
the
employee
if
you
ask
him
is
your
pension,
a
security;
i
suppose
it
would
say
no.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
pardon?
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
that
is
really
irrelevant.
this
court
has
recognized
clearly
that
that
provision
does
not
limit
in
anyway
the
other
provisions.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
someone
who
would
have
looked
at
it.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
if
i
had
looked
to
see
how
a
pension
fund
actually
operates
to
see
as
was
stated
in
the
few
sentences
that
i
read
from
the
union's
brochure
in
this
case
exactly,
exactly
how
it
worked
that
the
money's
are
invested,
the
profits
are
returned
that
that
is
--
that
those
profits
are
necessary
to
make
the
payments.
yes,
that
fits
this
court's
long
standing
definition.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
no,
your
honor.
the
whole
--
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
no,
your
honor
i
don't
believe
so.
the
whole
framework
of
putting
in
particularly
the
provision
investment
contract
was
to
have
a
residual
provision
to
see
to
it
that
people
would
not
be
able
to
evade
the
securities
laws
because
the
instrument
or
the
investment
that
they
had
was
something
they
didn't
fit
one
of
the
more
particular
provisions,
that
was
a
very
broad
all
encompassing
provision
and
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
specific
provisions
in
that
definition
said
so
in
the
joiner
case
i
believe
do
not
limit
in
any
way
the
other
provisions
like
investment
contract.
and
the
definitions
that
this
court
has
developed
for
--
ever
since
the
joiner
case
and
has
been
developed
by
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
for
over
40
years
clearly
encompass
this
kind
of
an
interest.
the
defendant's
reliance
on
forman
is
somehow
having
overturned
all
of
this
history
we
think
is
really
misplaced.
the
court
itself
didn't
view
forman
as
being
anything
more
than
application
of
the
preexisting
standards
basically
forman
was
a
holding
that
--
substance
over
form
is
a
two-way
street.
and
just
as
in
the
prior
cases,
it
had
been
used
against
defendants.
in
the
forman
case,
it
was
used
against
the
plaintiff
but
it
really
didn't
change
the
law.
and
in
particular
the
reliance
on
forman
is
really
as
a
basis
for
claiming
that
somehow
the
united
benefit
case
is
no
longer
the
law
wherein
united
benefit,
the
court
clearly
held
that
the
security
element
could
be
separated
from
the
insurance
element.
and
they
also
in
effect
say
that
forman
has
overruled
the
long
line
of
cases
as
to
whether
an
instrument
in
order
to
be
a
security
has
to
be
something
that's
traded
in
the
markets.
that
is
definitely
not
the
law
and
to
say
that
a
decision
like
forman
with
the
court
--
which
the
court
did
not
view
as
being
any
change
has
somehow
eliminated
all
that
to
us
it
seems
totally
unreasonable.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
okay.
may
i
just
say
one
thing
at
the
end.
mr.
jacob
h.
stillman
okay.
the
commission's
concern
in
this
case
is
not
solely
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
the
antifraud
provisions
to
pension
plans.
the
definition
of
investment
contract
over
the
years
has
served
this
probably
the
single
most
important
factor
in
preventing
people
from
avoiding
the
securities
laws
through
the
use
of
unusual
novel
devices
and
the
defendant's
position
if
accepted
would
have
far
reaching
effects
beyond
the
pension
plan
area
and
that
is
of
major
concern
to
the
commission.
thank
you
your
honor.
