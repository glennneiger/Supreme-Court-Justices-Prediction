international

e.

mr.
dickstein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
one
question
counsel,
there's
been
some
comment,
questions
to
you
about
the
difference
between
the
situation
that
existed
40
odd
years
ago
and
today
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
investment
in
pension
funds
that
are
within
the
range
of
collective
bargaining.
i
suppose
you
would
concede
that
if
congress
wanted
to
reexamine
the
situation
today
or
the
next
session,
that
those
changes
would
be
a
major
factor
in
their
approach
to
the
problem
and
might
lead
to
a
different
result
from
what
you
are
arguing
now
might
say
that
these
are
securities
in
other
words.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
had
no
difficulty
in
sloan
avoiding
long
standing
policy

think.
