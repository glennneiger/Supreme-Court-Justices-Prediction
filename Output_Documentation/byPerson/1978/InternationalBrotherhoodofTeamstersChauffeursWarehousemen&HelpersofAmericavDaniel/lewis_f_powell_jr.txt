justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
stillman,
is
there
any
other
case
in
which
an
investment
in
the
form
of
labor
has
been
a
way
of
deciding
that
it's
a
security?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
isn't
it
true
that
different
employees
con
--
can
contribute
different
amounts
--
the
labor
and
have
the
same
amount
to
be
contributed
to
the
pension
fund?
isn't
it
so
many
dollars
per
employee
without
regard
to
their
salary
level,
the
number
of
hours
worked
and
so
forth?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
stillman,
you've
been
talking
about
the
definition
of
security
which
of
course
is
the
threshold
issue.
i'm
looking
at
section
3
(a
)
(10)
of
the
34
act
to
which
a
substantially
like
2.1
of
the
act
of
33,
you
rely
on
the
term
investment
contract.
both
of
those
sections
also
have
as
a
catchall
any
instrument
commonly
known
as
a
security.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
whether
or
not
do
you
think
in
1933
or
34,
a
participation
on
the
pension
plan
would
have
been
considered
to
be
something
commonly
known
as
a
security?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
anybody
have
said
yes?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
who
would
have
said
yes?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
let's
assume
it
is
irrelevant.
who
would
have
said
yes?
would
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
me
ask
you
--
let
me
ask
you
another
question
about
these
two
sections.
they
defined
the
term
security
first
of
all
in
terms
of
18
or
20
different
types
of
securities
that
are
identified.
the
ten
means
note
stock,
treasure
stock,
bond
debentures
and
so
on
but
18
or
20
of
those
including
among
other
things
participation
in
any
profit
sharing
agreement.
do
you
think
it
might
have
occurred
to
somebody
in
the
congress
if
they
had
indeed
intended
to
include
pension
plans,
to
have
included
participation
in
a
pension
plan
among
the
18
to
20
things
they
did
itemized.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
don't
think
it
would've
occurred
to
them?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
your
view
mr.
walner
is
there
any
difference
when
the
elements
of
a
recovery
in
a
10
(b)
(5)
action
in
the
common
law
fraud
action.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
any
claim
that
erisa
has
destroyed
your
common
law
claim?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
congress
deliberately
cut
off
a
group
of
remedies
but
preserved
this
one.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
would
they
preserve
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
a
stock
option
deemed
to
be
an
investment
security
within
the
(voice
overlap)
act.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
for
an
employee
of
a
corporation,
does
a
corporation
have
to
register
a
stock
option
before
it
offset
to
one
of
its
offices?
i
haven't
looked
at
that
recently
but
that's
surprises
me
a
little
bit.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
there's
a
registration
statement
in
effect.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
it
presents
the
question
as
to
the
application
of
the
federal
securities
acts
to
noncontributory
compulsory
pension
plans.
under
the
plan
at
issue,
contributions
to
a
pension
fund
were
made
by
the
employer
based
on
the
number
of
weeks
worked
by
employees.
upon
accepting
employment,
an
employee
was
automatically
covered
by
the
plan.
as
it
was
noncontributory,
he
paid
no
money
into
the
fund.
the
employee
was
required
however
to
have
20
years
of
continuous
service
to
be
entitled
to
a
pension.
respondent
in
this
case
was
employed
for
more
than
20
years
but
because
his
service
was
entirely
continuous,
he
did
not
qualify
for
a
pension.
he
thereupon
brought
this
suit
against
the
international
union,
the
local
to
which
he
belonged
and
the
pension
fund.
he
alleged
that
petitioners
had
misrepresented
and
failed
to
disclose
material
facts
about
the
plan.
he
charged
common
law
fraud,
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
violation
of
the
federal
securities
acts.
we
are
concerned
in
this
case
only
with
the
claim
under
the
securities
acts.
the
application
of
these
acts
turns
upon
whether
the
employee's
interest
in
the
pension
plan
is
a
security
as
that
term
is
defined.
respondent
argued
successfully
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
his
interest
in
the
plan
was
an
investment
contract
within
the
definition
of
the
term
security.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
a
noncontributory
compulsory
pension
plan
is
not
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
securities
acts.
we
base
our
decision
on
the
plain
language
of
these
statutes
on
the
standards
applied
in
our
prior
cases
and
on
the
actions
over
the
years
by
the
congress,
by
the
sec
with
respect
to
pension
plans
of
the
type
involved
in
this
case.
we
express
no
opinion
as
to
respondent's
entitlement
to
proceed
on
the
other
counts
set
forth
in
his
complaint.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
and
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
