mr.
carmell,
before
you
sit
down
does
the
record
tell
us
what
significance
if
any
there
is
to
the
fact
that
the
--
that
daniel
took
--
a
withdraw
occurred,
is
that
critical
in
the
--
is
ineligibility?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
a
basic
question
and
i
always
wonder
about,
the
congressional
intent
we're
really
concerned
about
is
back
in
1935
isn't
it
or
33
rather
or
33
and
34?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
all
these
stuff
comes
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
its
clear
they
used
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
its
clear
they
used
some
broad
language
that
encompass
some
situations
they
did
not
specifically
contemplate
at
that
time,
that
much
i
think
you
have
to
concede.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
of
appeals
was
apparently
influenced
by
the
fact
that
pension
money
is
a
huge
percentage
of
the
total
capital
market
today
with
a
very
small
percentage
in
33.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dickstein,
before
you
sit,
let
me
ask
you
one
question,
i
think
i
understand
but
i'm
not
sure.
the
benefits
under
this
plan
are
subject
to
change
by
the
trustees
at
all
time,
aren't
they,
the
plaintiff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
the
consent
of
the
union
and
the
employers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
question
of
different
kinds
of
regulation,
they're
imposed,
don't
have
securities,
going
back
to
the
stock
purchase
plans
for
employees
which
are
--
everybody
concedes
those
are
covered.
does
the
sec
require
registration
of
those?
it
does,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
there
be
a
difference
if
this
is
security
and
if
this
is
a
sale,
what
is
the
policy
reason
for
saying
that
there
is
no
need
for
registration
if
it's
this
huge
segment
of
the
capital
market?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i'm
not
interested
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
we
say
now,
it
does
involve
a
sale,
it
does
involve
a
security,
should
it
not
and
is
it
not
important
enough
to
require
the
registration
as
well,
i'd
understand
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
other
than
concern
about
retroactive
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
prior
to
the
enactment
of
erisa,
it
would
seem
that
the
reasons
why
the
antifraud
provisions
apply,
should
equally
apply
--
should
equally
have
applied
to
the
registration
statement,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
walner.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
other
type
of
investment
contract
do
you
consider
to
be
the
closest
analogy
to
this
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
take
the
purchase
of
the
mutual
fund
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happens
there?
does
the
employee
end
up
with
a
designated
participation
in
the
mutual
fund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
--
could
you
tell
me
how
that
could
be
forfeited,
how
could
the
employee
lose
that
outright
as
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he'd
paid
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
could
--
he
couldn't
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
do
you
know
of
any
type
of
investment
where
one
as
you
suggests
has
contributed
his
wages
or
portions
of
him
over
a
period
of
years
in
the
acquisition
of
that
which
can
be
forfeited?
now,
i
know
you're
complaining
about
that
here
but
under
many
pension
plan
situations,
the
interest
is
forfeited
if
this
man
had
just
walked
away
and
stayed
away
for
good.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
it
had
vested,
it
would
have
been
forfeited,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wipes
out
if
what
he's
paid
all
together?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
wipes
out
what
he
has
paid
over
a
period
of
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
pay
anything
for
it
until
you
exercise
the
option.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right
there,
mr.
barack,
in
the
trusting
--
what
the
employee
entrusted
in
order
to
acquire
the
interest.
i
was
interested,
mr.
stillman
read
part
of
a
paragraph
on
page
14
of
this
document
but
the
paragraph
starts
out,
a
funded
pension
is
one
which
requires
an
employer
to
make
contributions
while
the
employee
member
works
instead
of
after
he
retires.
the
very
paragraph
he
cites
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
investment
and
money
is
made
by
the
employer
rather
than
the
laborer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
isn't
true
that
in
those
cases
if
the
person
contributing
the
services
were
terminated
for
some
reason
after
a
year
of
work.
he
would
still
have
some
interest
left
that
here
if
this
man
was
terminated,
he'd
have
no
interest
whatsoever.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
plan
were
never
subject
to
amendments,
say
a
defined
benefits
are
always
$2.00
or
whatever
the
payment
was.
it
was
not
--
never
to
be
amended,
would
you
still
be
able
to
make
your
argument.
is
it
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
in
the
contingent
interest
one
that
depending
on
the
trustees
amending
the
plan
to
increase
the
benefits
provided
there's
enough
money
there
that
is
a
means
to
reduce
the
claim
prior
to
contributions
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what's
your
view
on
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
your
view
on
that
question
for
a
fixed
dollar
annuity,
would
there
be
--
would
have
been
an
investment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
interest
would
there
be
in
profits,
i
mean
how
do
you
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
don't
read
the
whole
paragraph,
that's
what
i
object
to
both
there.
they
say
that
there's
enough
money
in
arizona
to
invest
that
you
can
be
sure
the
fund
will
grow
so
they
can
pay
you
the
$250.00
monthly
that's
provided
under
the
plan.
they
say
there's
going
to
be
enough
growth
to
meet
the
guaranteed
benefit.
that's
what
they
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
talk
about
this
is
going
to
give
you
$260.00
or
$270.00.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
don't
promise
profits
in
that
paragraph.
there's
a
promise
that
you
get
your
$250.00
a
month.
justice
john
paul
stevens
will
you
tell
us
what
caused
that
increase?
how
much
of
it,
what
percentage
of
it
repels
it
from
the
investment
efforts
of
the
trustees
of
the
fund
as
distinguished
from
additional
contributions
made
by
the
employer
as
a
result
of
collective
bargaining.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dickstein,
(voice
overlap)
--
if
you
look
at
the
--
this
thing
in
a
broad
sense
as
you're
suggesting
now,
you
supposed
that
before
vesting
occurs
an
employee
would
have
standing
to
bring
a
lawsuit
to
challenge
the
administration
of
the
fund
by
the
trustees.
your
figure
suggests
that
contributions
went
out
15
fold
when
benefits
only
went
up
seven
or
eight
fold.
i
would
have
play
have
it
--
standing
have
raised
a
question
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
does
have
some
interest
in
the
fund
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
whether
or
not
it's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
--
and
his
specific
interest
in
this
--
is
whether
it's
profitable
as
it
ought
to
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
embezzlement
wouldn't
prejudice
his
expectancy
of
$250.00
a
month
or
whatever
the
fixed
benefit
would
be.
what
interest
does
he
have?
