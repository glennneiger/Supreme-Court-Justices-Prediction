mr.
peter
j.
barack
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
whole
case
revolves
around
the
question
of
how
to
characterize
the
economic
interest
in
the
local
705
pension
fund
acquired
by
mr.
daniel
for
value
rendered.
and
this
economic
interest
is
an
interest
in
the
pool
or
fund
professionally
managed
investments,
stocks,
funds,
mortgages
and
the
like.
it
is
in
this
nature
akin
to
a
mutual
fund
or
a
variable
annuity
and
i
might
add
an
answer
to
some
of
the
comments
made
by
the
petitioner,
counsel
for
petitioners
this
morning
that
a
variable
annuity
fund
is
also
a
fund,
an
interest
in
the
variable
annuity
is
a
security
and
is
a
type
of
security
which
provides
for
the
annuitant
the
payment
in
the
future
of
an
annuity
as
you
will,
a
retirement
benefit.
the
economic
interest
here
as
in
7441
or
united
benefit
life
was
acquired
in
a
periodic
investment
program
by
the
giving
of
services
involving
the
pooling
and
professional
management
of
other
people's
money
to
provide
for
a
benefit,
profits
if
you
will
at
retirement
in
the
form
of
an
annuity.
mr.
peter
j.
barack
well,
one
can
answer
the
question
--
mr.
peter
j.
barack
well,
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
we
were
not
writing
on
the
cleans
--
on
a
clean
slate
as
this
court
has
expressly
recognized
in
forman.
there
are
six
prior
decisions
interpreting
the
definition
of
investment
contract
rendered
by
this
court.
in
these
sixth
decisions,
various
points
become
clear
which
make
it
absolutely
clear
also
that
we
have
a
security
here.
for
example,
the
question
has
come
up
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
this
might
be
a
novel
form
of
investment
means
that
it
is
not
a
security.
for
example,
(voice

--
mr.
peter
j.
barack
however,
a
variable
annuity
plan
is
a
security.
mr.
peter
j.
barack
now,
why
is
it
a
security?
it's
a
security
because
it
meets
the
elements
of
the
howey
rule.
now
what
are
the
elements
of
the
howey
rule
because
this
is
the
rule
that
has
been
reiterated
by
this
court
in
forman
as
defining
what
a
security
is.
now
the
howey
rule
states
that
you
have
to
have
an
entrusting
a
value
or
money
to
others
to
be
managed
with
the
reasonable
expectation
of
profits
to
be
managed
in
a
common
enterprise.
mr.
peter
j.
barack
well,
i
would
suggest
that
the
--
a
reading
of
the
howey
rule
in
order
not
to
exult
form
over
substance
in
order
to
look
at
the
economic
realities
involved.
all
you
need
is
an
investment
of
money
or
money's
worth.
now
there
has
been
at
least
i
believe
one
case,
a
district
court
case
in
texas,
sec.
b
edison
which
i
think
is
cited
in
page
54
of
our
brief
which
indicates
that
an
investment
of
services
would
constitute
the
necessary
investment
of
value
to
meet
the
first
prong
of
the
howey
test.
mr.
peter
j.
barack
that
is
a
question
that
goes
to
the
issue
of
contingency
an
issue
already
discussed.
what
i
would
suggest
the
inquiry
is
whether
something
otherwise
a
security
is
declassified
from
the
definition
of
security
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
contingent.
now
i
suggest
the
example
used
by
mr.
walner
that
a
stock
option
acquired
by
the
giving
of
services
which
option
can
only
be
exercised
after
a
number
of
years
is
a
security
which
is
not
declassified
from
the
definition
of
security
because
it
is
contingent.
let
us
look
further.
in
the
howey
rule
as
reiterated
in
forman,
what
is
stressed
is
that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
expectation
of
profits.
not
that
there'd
be
immediate
profits
today
or
tomorrow
or
in
year
one
or
in
year
two.
all
that
is
required
is
that
there'd
be
a
reasonable
expectation
of
profits.
mr.
peter
j.
barack
but
that
--
that
is
the
question
--
mr.
peter
j.
barack
that
raises
a
very
interesting
question
which
is
whether
or
not
a
fixed
dollar
annuity
which
cannot
be
amended
is
also
a
security.
that
question
was
not
presented
in
valich
(ph)
and
is
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
j.
barack
pardon?
mr.
peter
j.
barack
i
would
think
that
it's
a
very
close
question
and
i
don't
think
i
have
any
answers
with
it.
mr.
peter
j.
barack
however,
this
is
not
that
case
because
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
lure
to
the
investor
was
actually
the
profit
element.
as
mr.
stillman
has
quoted
from
the
owned
brochure,
it
is
the
money
that
has
contributed
that
is
growing
which
is
the
lure
to
the
investor.
now
indeed
in
this
case,
the
profits
in
the
form
of
retirement
benefits
promised
to
investors
have
increased
--
mr.
peter
j.
barack
well,
that's
not
--
mr.
peter
j.
barack
well,
this
is
the
promise
of
profits.
they
say
we're
promising
profits
--
mr.
peter
j.
barack
well,
it
--
this
is
a
promise
again
that
you're
getting
this
and
they
also
reiterate
throughout
their
descriptive
materials
which
have
been
distributed
which
we
alleged
are
materially
misleading
that
over
the
course
of
the
period
of
time
the
benefits
have
been
increase
and
indeed
this
is
just
the
facts
here.
the
promise
--
the
profits
promised
have
increased
from
an
initial
$75.00
per
month
for
persons
retiring
in
1955
to
$550.00
per
month
for
persons
retiring
in
1977.
mr.
peter
j.
barack
well,
we
don't
know
the
exact
answer
to
that
question
in
terms
of
the
numbers
but
let
me
tell
you
an
--
a
number
that
we
do
know
that
is
analogous
to
that.
we
do
know
that
by
the
defendant's
own
computations
when
there
has
been
an
investment
along
the
example
they
use
of
approximately
$9500.00
in
the
pension
fund
that
there
would
be
substantial
profits
returned
to
the
investor
and
now
these
substantial
profits
approximately
$5000.00
would
represent
earnings
on
that
fund
were
approximately
50%
of
the
amount
invested.
let's
look
at
it
from
another
point
of
view,
the
people
--
the
persons
investing
in
this
fund
investing
$30.00
a
week,
$1500.00
a
year
or
over
$30,000.00
on
a
20-year
career,
if
invested
risk-free
at
7.5%
in
the
savings
bank
that
would
amount
to
$72,000.00
over
22
--
a
20-year
career.
so
the
profit
potential
is
tremendous
and
this
is
what
induces
these
people
to
invest
here.
mr.
peter
j.
barack
we
believe
that
the
facts
when
we
get
to
trial
in
this
case
will
indicate
--
mr.
peter
j.
barack
in
the
agreement?
no.
but
i
think
that
the
promotional
material
which
is
used
to
induce
these
people
to
invest
goes
over
the
history
of
how
these
benefits
have
been
increased
periodically
over
the
period
of
time.
mr.
peter
j.
barack
this
is
an
import
--
this
is
an
important
--
mr.
peter
j.
barack
this
is
an
important
question,
the
question
that
we
have
to
recognize
that
the
defendants
have
conceded
a
voluntary
contributory
plan.
an
interest
in
such
a
plan
is
a
security.
now
they
have
appended
a
name
to
our
particular
type
of
invest
--
employee
plan,
involuntary
and
noncontributory.
well,
what
are
they
saying
when
they're
saying
that
a
plan
is
involuntary.
they're
saying
something
about
the
fact
that
either
an
employee
who
makes
an
employment
decision
cannot
also
make
an
investment
decision
or
that
an
investment
decision
undertaken
by
an
employee
is
secondary
to
the
employment
decision
undertaken.
well,
it's
certainly
true
in
this
case
as
held
that
the
presence
of
a
security
cannot
be
defeated
by
the
fact
that
the
transaction
issue
involves
other
substantive
dimensions.
for
example,
this
court
in
valich
(ph)
in
the
united
benefit
life
has
found
a
security,
an
investment
contract
there
present
even
though
the
person
there
was
acquiring
other
elements
of
insurance.
mr.
peter
j.
barack
let
me
just
conclude
that.
mr.
peter
j.
barack
mr.
justice
harlan
thus
stated
in
united
benefit
life
that
the
two
promises
involved
are
entirely
distinct
and
maybe
separated
from
one
another.
i
think
--
let
me
just
finally
then
conclude
that
this
type
of
security
which
we
have
present
here
meets
the
definition
of
investment
contract
because
mr.
daniel
has
turned
over
his
retirement
funds
to
others
to
be
managed
in
the
pulled
investment
program
on
the
promise
of
profits
and
that
therefore
it
was
within
the
intent
of
congress
to
protect
against
by
enacting
the
antifraud
rules
of
the
federal
securities
laws.
thank
you.
