mr.
sidney
dickstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
carmell
has
indicated,
there
is
no
dispute
that
in
the
extensive
legislative
history
that
preceded
the
enactment
of
the
securities
acts
of
1933
and
1934
and
in
the
statutes
themselves
as
initially
enacted,
there
was
no
mention
whatever
of
pension
plans.
certainly
the
reason
for
not
mentioning
pension
plans
could
not
have
been
as
the
court
below
suggested
that
there
was
such
a
rare
bird
that
congress
simply
ignored
them
or
overlooked
them.
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
securities
laws,
3.5
to
4
million
united
american
employees
employed
by
hundreds
of
large
industrial
corporations
were
covered
by
pension
plans.
moreover,
that
congress
was
legislating
with
respect
to
pensions
in
the
revenue
acts
of
1926,
28,
32
and
34
in
the
railroad
retirement
act
of
1934
and
as
mr.
carmell
has
indicated
they
played
a
role
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
is
not
our
point
that
this
was
a
subject
for
special
legislative
concern
on
the
collective
bargaining
area.
it
is
rather
our
point
that
whenever
congress
turn
to
the
subject
of
pensions,
it
was
functioning
in
the
employer-employee
area
of
which
collective
bargaining,
it's,
of
course,
just
one
aspect.
we
believe
the
reason
why
one
finds
no
mention
whatever
of
pensions
in
the
securities
laws
is
that
as
this
court
said
in
forman,
the
congress's
focus
in
enacting
those
laws
was
to
deal
with
the
capital
markets
of
the
enterprise
system
and
to
regulate
the
sale
of
securities
to
raise
capital
for
profit
making
purposes.
when
we
speak
of
pensions
on
retirement
from
employment,
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
capital
market,
we
are
dealing
with
the
labor
market
nor
are
we
talking
about
the
raising
of
capital
for
profit
making
purposes.
certainly
pensions
are
not
included
within
the
types
of
arrangements
that
again
to
quote
according
forman
in
our
commercial
world
fall
within
the
ordinary
concept
to
the
security.
this
short
straightforward
analysis
which
occupied
but
eight
pages
of
our
opening
brief
is
we
believe
the
answer
here.
but
transaction
under
which
someone
goes
to
work
for
an
employer
and
as
thereby
covered
by
a
noncontributory
pension
plan
as
an
incident
of
his
employment
is
like
the
transaction
in
forman
simply
not
a
purchase
of
securities
within
the
contemplation
of
the
federal
securities
laws.
there
is
one
type
of
pension
plan
which
is
unarguably
covered
by
the
securities
laws.
this
is
a
type
of
voluntary
contributory
plan
where
employee
contributions
are
used
to
purchase
the
employer
stock.
put
it
in
another
way,
to
add
capital
to
the
employer's
coffers
for
profit
making
purposes.
but
this
is
not
covered
because
it
is
a
pension
plan
but
rather
because
it
is
an
employee
stock
purchase
plan
and
the
fact
that
it
has
pension
or
retirement
features
does
not
alter
that
basic
fact.
the
sec
has
consistently
treated
such
plans
as
subject
to
the
securities
acts,
has
advised
congress
to
that
effect
and
no
one
seriously
quarrels
with
that
proposition.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
your
honor
the
securities
and
exchange
commissions
position
is
that
that
transaction,
there
were
two
securities
involved.
one
is
the
interest
in
the
plan
under
which
the
stock
is
purchased
and
the
other
is
the
stock
of
the
employer
as
well.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
the
interest
of
the
plan
and
the
special
circumstance
in
which
employer
stock
is
bought
with
employee
money
is
indivisible
with
the
arrangement
of
the
entire
arrangement
under
which
that
stock
is
purchased.
here,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
purchase
of
employer
stock
at
all
in
the
noncontributory
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
we're
talking
about
a
participating
interest
in
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
there
are
several
reasons
for
that
your
honor.
one
reason
of
course
is
that
in
the
type
of
plan
we
are
--
in
the
type
of
plan
that
the
sec
has
always
considered
to
represent
a
security.
the
employee's
money
is
being
used
to
capitalize
the
employer.
the
employer
is
selling
securities
to
the
employer
on
the
vehicle.
the
plan
through
which
he
does
it
is
simply
the
wraparound.
in
the
type
of
plan
that
was
involved
here,
that
is
the
noncontributory
mandatory
plan
and
for
that
matter
i
would
add
the
voluntary
contributory
plan
in
which
there
is
no
investment
in
employer's
stock
of
the
employee
dollars.
this
is
not
used
to
fund
the
employer's
enterprise
and
we
think
in
that
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
your
honor
the
answer
again
is
that
in
the
instance
where
the
employee's
money
is
buying
employers
stock,
that
is
always
been
treated
as
a
transaction
covered
by
the
security.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
and
if
one
wraps
that
basic
transaction
around
the
retirement
plan
in
which
the
stock
which
is
purchased
is
kept
in
a
fund,
it
is
ultimately
given
to
the
employee
on
retirement
or
ultimately
sold
in
order
to
fund
his
retirement
that
does
not
change
that
basic
reality.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
it
is
still
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
no
your
honor,
we
do
not
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
not
only
do
we
not
concede
it
to
be
securities
in
this
case,
we
are
--
we
believe
the
--
not
only
that
congress
has
not
considered
it
to
be
securities
and
the
sec
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
and
until
quite
recently
the
sec
did
not
maintain
that
they
have
securities.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
in
a
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
they
--
no,
your
honor,
of
course
they
are
invested
in
securities.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
oh,
yes.
but,
they
are
not
in
this
instance
--
of
course,
they're
not
invested
in
employer's
security.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
but
even
--
but
they
are
invested
in
securities
unquestionably
and
it
is
quite
clear
that
purports
the
investment
of
pension
fund
--
pension
funds
in
a
portfolio
of
securities.
that
is
the
securities
that
are
purchased
with
those
funds
does
involve
the
securities
acts.
nobody
has
ever
challenged
that.
that's
quite
clear.
and
it's
quite
consistent
with
erisa
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
in
erisa
when
the
congress,
in
erisa
there
is
a
definition
of
the
term
security
which
utilizes
the
definition
in
the
said
securities
act
of
1933.
and
when
you
read
the
act
throughout,
the
--
every
time
that
term
is
used,
it
is
used
in
connection
with
the
purchase
of
securities
for
the
portfolio
of
the
pension
fund.
it
is
not
used
in
connection
with
the
interest
of
the
participant
in
that
fund
for
that
congress
chooses
quite
different
words.
but
the
fact
of
the
coverage
of
one
that
is
the
portfolio
security
under
the
securities
act
does
not
buy
any
means
mean
that
the
participating
interest
of
the
employee
is
thereby
a
security.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
early
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
that
the
history
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
your
honor,
yes,
i
do,
because
it
is
clearly
a
security.
the
sec
has
taken
the
position
that
it
is
from
the
very
outset.
it
has
advised
congress
that
that
is
the
circumstance,
the
only
circumstance
which
involves
the
securities
acts
that
is
the
circumstances
pertaining
to
pension
funds
and
congress
has
proceeded
on
that
perception.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
but
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not
arguing
exception
but
what
i
--
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
oh,
yes,
oh,
yes.
and
the
reason
why
we
say
that
is
because
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
question
of
congressional
intent
and
congress,
it
is
congress
which
has
acted
in
the
pension
area,
it
has
acted
expressly
with
respect
to
security
act
disclosures
and
that
of
course
is
what
we're
talking
about
here
in
the
wppda
of
1958
and
in
erisa
in
1974.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
an
exception,
an
interdiction
and
inhibition
of
that
construction
whichever
way
--
i
think
one
can
fairly
put
it
that
way.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
they
reflect
both
congressional
understandings
and
actions
based
upon
those
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
--
on
those
understandings,
quite
correct.
and
this
is
an
understanding
to
which
the
sec
as
a
matter
of
fact
made
the
major
contribution
and
we
think
that
congress
having
acted
in
that
fashion
even
if
it
were
once
possible
to
construe
the
securities
laws
in
a
fashion
that
would
cover
these
type
of
arrangement
that
is
no
longer
possible
because
again
we
are
dealing
with
the
matter
of
congressional
intent.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
that
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
that
is
certainly
true.
and
if
we
deal
with
congressional
intent
back
in
1933
and
34,
an
interdicted
it
at
that
point,
cut
it
off
at
that
point.
what
would
the
congressional
perception
have
been?
mr.
sidney
dickstein
that's
really
the
question.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
but
we're
--
in
dealing
with
pensions
we're
not
dealing
with
some
new
device,
we're
not
dealing
with
some
recent
invention,
we're
dealing
with
something
which
existed
then,
existed
as
a
significant
force
and
the
american
labor
relations
and
it
is
congress'
perception
as
it
then
existed
as
to
whether
or
not
pension
funds
were
covered
by
the
securities
laws
which
is
of
course
the
significant
aspect.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
no
question
about
it,
it
was
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
because
of
the
growth
of
pensions
in
19
--
in
the
mid
50's
that
congress
turned
to
express
concern
with
the
absence
of
disclosures
to
pension
plan
participants,
conducted
its
studies
very,
very
carefully
inquired
into
the
subject
over
a
long
period
of
time
and
enacted
the
welfare
and
pension
plans
disclosure
act
as
an
expression
of
concern.
as
pension
funds
became
more
important,
congress
revisited
the
subject
of
pension
plans
and
provided
for
further
disclosures,
disclosures
which
is
one
reads
erisa.
you
have
to
conclude
our
detailed
comprehensive
and
all
embracing.
in
addition,
to
which
it
enacted
substantive
regulations
with
respect
to
pension
plans
which
up
until
that
time
had
not
been
a
matter
of
federal
concern
and
so
it
was
the
congressional
reaction
to
this
economic
reality
of
the
growing
importance
of
pension
funds
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
that
--
a
little
acorn
may
have
grown
into
too
much
of
an
oak
for
that
your
honor.
although
i
would
say
that
in
the
context
of
this
case
and
it's
certainly
this
--
it
is
in
our
question
present
it.
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
an
implied
private
right
of
action
under
the
antifraud
provisions
of
the
securities
laws,
one
can
well
consider
as
this
court
has
on
occasion
consider,
what
the
subject
matter
is
and
how
far
one
is
prepared
to
go.
what
is
--
to
whether
there's
an
implied
right
of
action
on
the
rather
circumstances
of
course
i'd
be
prepared
i
suppose
to
accept
at
least
arguendo
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
such
a
right
of
action
exists.
there
is
--
there
were
several
observations
to
make
about
the
sec's
present
position.
one
is
that
when
it
says,
“oh,
we
all
along
knew
that
these
nine
contributory
pension
plans
were
covered
by
securities
who
were
covered
by
the
securities
act.”
we
were
only
talking
when
we
said
that
there
was
no
sale
and
hence
they
were
not
covered.
we
were
only
talking
about
the
registration
provisions
and
not
about
the
antifraud
provisions.
suffice
to
say
if
there
were
one
instance
in
the
extensive
legislative
history
of
commission
statements,
of
commission
reports,
of
commission
analysis
in
which
the
sec
had
taken
of
affirmative
position
before
the
congress
or
for
that
matter
anywhere
else
that
the
antifraud
laws
are
applicable
to
interest
in
noncontributory
pension
plans.
sec
counsel
would
be
trumpeting
it
here
but
he
will
not
because
there
is
none.
and,
so
the
sec
is
really
is
a
fallback
position
to
as
well
we've
report
it.
45
years
to
make
a
great
deal,
a
difference
in
the
world
of
pensions
and
we
now
think
that
when
an
employee
goes
to
work
for
an
employer
and
has
in
mind
the
pension
plan
and
is
influenced
in
going
to
work
for
that
employer
by
the
existence
of
the
pension
plan,
he
has
purchased
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
the
securities
laws.
what's
more
says
the
sec.
when
he
goes
to
work
each
day
again
so
long
as
he
has
the
pension
plan
in
mind
as
an
inducement,
he
is
purch
--
continuing
to
purchase
that
security.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
well,
that
is
precisely
one
of
the
points
which
of
course
differentiate
what
we
have
here
from
what
we
had
in
a
conventional
security
in
a
commercial
sense
or
even
a
non-conventional
security
in
a
congressional
sense.
the
employee
has
no
interest
to
sell.
he
has
the
right
under
certain
circumstances
upon
the
fulfillment
of
employment
requirements
to
receive
a
retirement
pension
and
that
fact
alone
i
think
is
a
significant
differential.
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
argument
for
rebuttal.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
no,
i
think
we
have
the
best
evidence
of
that
as
what
congress
has
in
fact
done
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
because
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
oh,
of
course
they
can
change
their
views.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
but
they
have
already
--
they
have
already
acted
at
least
twice
based
upon
the
new
evidence
of
the
mounting
importance
of
pensions
in
this
country.
and
when
they
have
done
so,
they
have
acted
in
a
manner
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
an
interest
in
a
noncontributory
pension
plan
is
a
security
and
that
disclosures
are
required
under
the
securities
laws
to
supplement
the
risk.
your
honor,
you
simply
cannot
read
erisa
and
particularly
the
statements
of
policies
in
section
1
and
the
disclosure
provisions
of
sections
101
through
111
without
coming
away
from
the
--
with
the
strongest
of
beliefs
that
congress
thought
that
in
the
disclosure
area
on
pensions
it
was
writing
on
a
blank
slate
and
it
wrote
on
that
slate
what
it
wish
to
have
there
and
that
of
course
is
the
point.
the
legislative
history
of
erisa
totally
confirms
that
and
that
which
the
sec
said
to
the
congress,
totally
confirmed
that
belief.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
yes,
this
is
a
--
this
of
course
is
a
defying
benefit
plan.
these
trustees
may
alter
the
level
of
benefits.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
it
would
be
an
act
which
would
be
participated
in
by
the
trustees
and
would
be
equally
designated
by
the
employers
and
the
trustees.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
defined
benefit.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
defined
benefit.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
mr.
barack,
at
the
end
of
his
argument
said
that
we
have
conceded
that
an
interest
in
a
voluntary
contributory
pension
fund
is
a
security.
i
feel
like
the
man
who
gave
up
the
tip
of
his
finger
and
found
that
his
whole
arm
had
been
swallowed
up.
we've
said
it
again
and
again
and
again,
we
said
in
our
reply
brief
all
that
we
do
say
and
this
is
consistent
with
what
the
sec
has
said,
is
that
where
you
have
a
plan
where
employer
stock
is
purchased
with
employee
money,
that
is
a
security,
but
nothing
else
is.
and
mr.
stillman
and
i
think
with
candor
in
honor
to
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
as
to
whether
or
not
the
security,
the
inaction
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
can
in
anyway
be
attributed
to
their
position
with
regard
to
no
sale.
stated
with
candor
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
sec
has
taken
no
enforcement
action
whatever
even
with
respect
to
voluntary
contributory
plans.
and
we
believe
that
35
years
of
quiescence
from
an
agency
which
is
hardly
known
for
its
passivity
speaks
volumes.
there
was
another
question
asked
of
mr.
barack
and
that
was
how
much
of
this
increase
in
pension
benefits
from
$75.00
to
$550.00
represent
increase
in
employer
contributions.
mr.
barack
actually
did
have
the
figures
and
he
stated
it
although
in
an
inadvertent
way.
the
initial
employer
contributions
to
the
705
fund
were
$2.00
a
week
as
mr.
barack
says
it's
now
$30.00
a
week.
during
the
period
of
time
in
which
the
pension
benefit,
the
defined
benefit
has
gone
from
$75.00
to
$550.00,
an
increase
of
about
seven-fold.
the
amount
of
contribution
has
gone
up
15
times.
i
think
this
is
really
relevant
because
it
does
tend
to
deal
with
even
the
isolated
factors
in
this
type
of
arrangement
which
mr.
barack
shows
that
under
the
howey
definition
of
a
security
demonstrate
that
this
is
a
security.
about
howey,
i
think
the
first
thing
to
say
is
that
the
formulation
in
that
case
was
designed
to
ascertain
congress'
intent
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
word
security.
here
we
think
there
are
much
better
indicia
of
congressional
intent.
but
even
if
there
were
not
and
even
if
one
looks
at
the
howey
formulation,
we
think
it's
simply
intends
to
reinforce
the
proposition
that
when
you're
talking
about
pensions,
you
are
outside
of
the
realm
of
the
securities
laws.
they
say
investment
of
money,
the
first
howey
criteria
or
element
and
i
say,
well,
we
have
it
here
because
when
the
employer
puts
$2.00
in
the
pension
fund
that's
the
same
as
if
he
handed
the
$2.00
to
the
employee
and
the
employee
hand
it
to
the
pension
fund
administrator
and
said
put
this
away
for
my
retirement.
well,
this
court
of
course
in
alabama
power
when
it
considered
the
questions
of
pensions
recognized
that
it
is
by
no
means
as
simple
as
that.
there
are
all
kinds
of
reasons
why
employers
have
pension
plans
and
why
employers
make
contributions
to
pension
plans
including
the
humanitarian
as
well
as
a
good
labor
policy
reason
that
when
an
employee
is
too
old
to
work
he
would
have
some
money
in
his
pocket
as
he
leaves
the
plant
door.
a
dollar
in
the
pension
fund
in
a
noncontributory
pension
plan
is
not
fungible
with
a
dollar
purchase
of
a
mutual
fund.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
erisa
make
sharp
distinctions
between
contributory,
between
employer
dollars
and
employee
dollars,
when
the
employee
makes
a
contribution
to
a
pension
plan
it
by
terms
of
erisa
is
non-forfeitable.
when
the
employer
makes
a
contribution
of
course
it
is
forfeitable
unless
and
until
vesting
is
achieved.
they
talked
about
the
interest
income.
whose
income
really
is
this?
in
the
simple
model
of
a
single
employer
pension
plan
it's
quite
clear
that
the
interest
income
which
is
earned
on
the
money
that
that
employer
places
on
the
fund
has
to
do
with
the
level
of
funding
and
how
much
more
the
employer
has
to
put
in,
in
order
to
pay
the
defined
benefit
provided
by
that
plan.
i
will
not
go
into
each
of
these
factors
in
isolation
but
when
one
views
them
in
howey
terms,
one
has
to
conclude
that
they're
all
somewhat
skewed
and
i
think
i'm
being
charitable
when
i
say
somewhat.
because
the
point
is
these
elements
cannot
be
viewed
in
isolation.
along
of
the
other
factors
pertaining
to
noncontributory
pension
plans,
the
plaintiff
and
the
sec
dismisses
their
relevancies,
break
in
service,
minimum
periods
of
employment,
whoever
heard
of
a
security
where
you
get
paid
off
if
you're
disabled
and
you
don't
get
paid
off
if
you
quit
your
job.
we
are
talking
about
an
aspect
of
employment.
i
quite
agree
with
mr.
stillman
--
mr.
sidney
dickstein
certainly.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
the
--
as
a
--
in
that
sense
just
--
i
suppose
like
a
contingent
remainder
in
an
ordinary
trust.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
might
have
the
right
--
might
have
the
right
to
bring
the
suit
against
the
trustee.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
no.
he's
interest
i
supposed
if
the
trustees
were
acting
as
imprudent
trustees
under
erisa
or
were
embezzling
funds
for
example,
i
think
you
would
have
a
sufficient
interest.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
it
--
in
that
sense
he
would
have
a
sufficient
interest.
in
a
security
sense
he
does
not
have
a
sufficient
interest,
we're
simply
talking
in
a
different
area.
mr.
sidney
dickstein
there
is
no
single
aspect
which
perhaps
by
itself
you
cannot
find
extent
in
a
circums
--
in
a
situation
in
which
you
would
say
that
there
is
a
security.
but
you
put
it
all
together
and
you
examined
the
totality
of
the
transaction,
it's
clear
that's
its
not.
mr.
stillman
spoke
about
the
six
cases
that
this
--
in
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
question
of
security
and
from
joiner
in
'43,
the
forman
in
'75,
it
all
comes
down
to
this.
the
test
is
what
character
the
instrument
is
giving
in
commerce.
it
was
setting
joiner
that
way,
we're
setting
forman
that
way.
we
think
the
common
understanding
here,
the
common
understanding
in
33,
34
and
today
is
that
it
is
not
a
security.
