but
mrs.
gordon
is
it
not
true
that
the
private
schools
both
religious
and
secular
have
as
part
of
their
mission
training
of
the
pupils
for
citizenship
and
in
fact
doesn't
the
state
require
certain
course
content
in
order
to
fulfill
that
objective?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
though
they
are
different
--
even
though
they
are
differences,
is
not
the
reason
for
the
regulation
of
the
private
schools,
the
states
interest
and
being
sure
that
all
children
are
properly
trained
for
citizenship.
isn't
that
the
overriding
objective
in
the
recent
--
for
the
regulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
did
they
regulate
private
schools
at
all
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
are
some
of
the
attitudes
and
values
that
the
citizen
has
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
do
not
have?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
he
can
vote?
he
can
vote?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
can't
these
people
participate
and
debate
i
suppose
which
is
part
of
democratic
decision-making
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
any
requirement
in
new
york
that
your
teachers
must
vote
in
order
to
hold
their
job?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
point
mr.
ennis,
doesn't
your
opponent
make
it
clear
that
about
a
large
number
don't
do
so
because
they
fear
there
is
a
constitutional
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
about
50-50
on
the
policy
choice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
reading
all
of
them
except
foley?
justice
john
paul
stevens
reading
all
of
them
except
foley?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
not
knowing
it
didn't
include
policeman
or
did
include
policeman.
that
came,
i
think
must
have
come
as
quite
a
surprise
about
a
few
of
those
states
attorney
general.
justice
john
paul
stevens
dissenting
one
of
the
concurrence
if
we
might
add.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
teaching
a
public
school
a
governmental
monopoly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
rule
does
not
apply
except
in
public
schools
to
the
extent
that
the
rule
applies
it
applies
in
the
governmental
monopoly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ennis,
do
you
happen
to
know
what
percentage
of
the
new
york
state
budget
is
devoted
to
public
education?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
most
states,
education
is
a
single
largest
item
in
the
state
budget
that
may
not
be
true
in
new
york
in
the
view
of
the
welfare
law
with.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
gordon,
let
me
just
ask
one
question
if
i
â€“
i
don't
think
it's
repetitious
but
is
there
a
characteristic
of
alienage,
the
class
that's
affected
by
this
rule
that
has
any
relevance
to
their
teaching
ability
and
if
so,
what
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry
i
really
did
not
understand
your
answer.
what
is
--
could
you
just
tell
me
in
a
word,
what
is
the
characteristic
of
the
group
that
is
relevant
to
their
ability
to
teach?
