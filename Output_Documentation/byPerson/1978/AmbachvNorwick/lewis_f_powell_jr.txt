justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you've
use
the
word
necessary
to
attain
the
state
objective.
do
you
really
mean
that?
that's
the
terminology
of
strict
scrutiny.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
thought
you're
arguing
rational
basis?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
just
said
even
under
the
rational
basis,
you
would
think
the
statute
is
invalid.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
that
context,
you
use
the
word
necessary
without
a
slip
of
the
tongue.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
interrupt
you
because
what
you
said
startles
me
when
you
suggest
that
a
school
board
member
who
never
goes
into
a
classroom
has
as
much
authority
with
what
a
pupil
is
taught
to
think
and
what
the
value
is
that
people
may
be
as
result
to
being
taught
by
classroom
teachers,
is
that
your
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
ennis.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
you
are
arguing
that
school
board
members
have
as
much
authority
and
influence
over
the
pupil
as
teachers
do,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
don't
have
--
are
textbooks
are
selected
in
new
york?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
know
the
process
by
which
textbooks
are
selected
in
new
york
city?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
actually,
what
happens
is
that
committees
of
teachers
select
the
books.
the
school
board
ratifies
those,
all
of
them
without
ever
having
read
any
of
them.
i've
been
there
i
know.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

the
first
is
in
76-808,
ambach
against
norwick.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
new
york
may
impose
a
citizenship
requirement
upon
its
public
school
teachers.
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
held
that
this
requirement
excluding
the
resident
aliens
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
although
the
exclusion
of
aliens
from
fields
of
private
employment
generally
serves
no
legitimate
state
interest.
the
constitution
and
our
decisions
have
made
clear
that
states
properly
may
limit
participation
of
aliens
in
at
least
certain
governmental
functions.
only
last
term
we
upheld
new
york's
citizenship
requirement
with
respect
to
police
officers
because
of
the
important
role
of
the
police
function
in
the
exercise
of
governmental
authority.
for
essentially
the
same
reasons
we
think
teaching
in
the
public
schools
also
constitutes
a
governmental
function
that
may
be
confined
to
citizens.
teachers,
both
through
the
instruction
they
give
and
the
example
they
set
shape
the
basic
attitudes
of
children
toward
our
democratic
form
of
government,
the
political
processes
of
this
country
and
the
obligations
of
american
citizenship.
we
think
a
state
rationally
may
decide
that
only
those
persons
who
have
made
an
unequivocal
legal
commitment
to
our
form
of
government
through
the
tie
of
citizenship
should
be
entrusted
with
this
important
responsibility.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
we
also
note
that
the
resident
aliens
who
brought
this
suit
could
have
qualified
to
teach
under
the
new
york
law
by
applying
for
united
states
citizenship.
they
were
eligible
and
free
to
do
this
but
preferred
to
retain
their
citizenship
allegiance
to
other
countries.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
joined.
